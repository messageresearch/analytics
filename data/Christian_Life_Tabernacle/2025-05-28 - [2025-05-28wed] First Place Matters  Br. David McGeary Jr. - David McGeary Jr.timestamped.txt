[40:58] I
[41:01] know the
[41:05] [Music]
[41:11] rain shine
[41:13] [Music]
[41:15] again. I know the master of the wind.
[41:20] Let's go before the master. Heavenly
[41:22] Father, we're so thankful that we could
[41:24] witness to you being the master of the
[41:26] storm. And Lord, that it's more than
[41:29] just that you are, but that we know you
[41:30] to be, Father. That each of us has been
[41:33] made a witness, Lord, that you came to
[41:35] us in our hour of need, in our hour of
[41:37] desperation, Father. And you brought
[41:39] peace that passes understanding, oh God.
[41:41] And Lord, you're the same yesterday,
[41:43] today, and forever. And Father, right
[41:46] now, there could be troubled waters.
[41:48] There could be things that are beyond
[41:49] our ability to understand, Lord, but
[41:52] you're still the master. And Father, by
[41:54] you all things were made and all things
[41:56] consist, Lord. And it's that confidence
[41:59] that's brought us here tonight, Father.
[42:01] And Lord, we want to submit ourselves to
[42:04] you, Lord, that even in the our ability
[42:07] and what we've prepared for, Father,
[42:09] that you would lead our hearts, Lord, to
[42:10] minister to the needs of your people.
[42:12] And Lord, we would be willing to make
[42:14] ourselves foolish for your people's
[42:16] sake. Lord, if you would draw us a way
[42:18] that we wouldn't even be prepared to,
[42:20] Lord, may you just minister to those who
[42:23] sit in an hour of need, Father, for
[42:25] we've gathered to feast at your table,
[42:27] Lord. And Lord, just now, may you settle
[42:30] each one, Lord. May they be aware of
[42:32] your presence, that you're the reason
[42:34] we've gathered, Father. And Lord, may
[42:37] you receive the glory in all things. We
[42:39] commit it all to you. In the precious
[42:41] name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus
[42:42] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[42:45] If you would take your Bibles and turn
[42:47] with me to the book of
[42:53] Colossians, we'll read uh out of chapter
[42:57] 1 starting in the 15th
[43:01] verse. As you turn there, we uh were
[43:04] able to be in fellowship this past
[43:05] weekend with our brother Andrew, brother
[43:07] Bryce Collins, Brother Jeremy at Brother
[43:09] Sam Parker's up in Kansas. It was a a
[43:12] wonderful time of fellowship and we're
[43:14] really blessed by the ministry. Our
[43:15] brother Andrew just uh the Lord used him
[43:18] in a wonderful way and I I was a
[43:20] beneficiary of it and want to thank him
[43:23] for that. And as you know, we have
[43:26] ministers that go out from this body.
[43:28] It's your prayers and and the support
[43:31] that I'm sure is a a great part of the
[43:34] success in the Lord using their
[43:35] ministry. And as it's been mentioned
[43:37] several times, our brother Matthew's
[43:39] ministering for to our youth, to our
[43:42] children uh in Arizona, and many that
[43:44] would be gathered in our hearts and
[43:46] prayers are with them as well. So we
[43:48] would read in the book of Colossians
[43:50] starting the 15th verse, who is the
[43:53] image of the invisible God, the
[43:55] firstborn of every creature. For by him
[43:57] were all things created that are in
[43:59] heaven, that are in earth, visible and
[44:02] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[44:05] dominions or principalities or
[44:08] powers. All things were created by him
[44:11] and for him. And he is before all
[44:15] things, and by him all things
[44:18] consist. And he is the head of the
[44:21] body, the church, who is the beginning,
[44:25] the firstborn from the dead, that in all
[44:28] things he might have the preeminence.
[44:31] For it pleased the Father that in him
[44:34] should all fullness dwell. and having
[44:38] made peace through the blood of the
[44:40] cross. By him to reconcile all things
[44:43] unto himself, by him I say, whether they
[44:46] be things in earth or things in heaven.
[44:50] Let's just bow our heads one more time.
[44:52] Heavenly Father, what a rich word that
[44:54] we've read, Lord. And if we could just
[44:56] grasp but one line of this, Father, we
[44:58] believe we'd leave transformed and
[45:00] different. And Lord, we ask that the
[45:01] power of this word would transform our
[45:03] lives now as we commit it to you, as we
[45:05] submit ourselves to you. In the name of
[45:08] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. You may be
[45:12] seated. The thought that uh would be
[45:14] upon our hearts and and
[45:17] uh is really just in in the line of
[45:21] where the Lord dealt with us is God has
[45:24] a purpose. He had a purpose in Christ
[45:26] and declaring himself in Christ where
[45:28] the invisible things of God were made
[45:29] manifest in Christ. And so it was to
[45:32] make himself known to have the
[45:33] preeminence in Christ. And as our
[45:36] prophet would tell us all that he poured
[45:38] into Christ, he poured into the church.
[45:40] So the preeminence or the or the uh in
[45:43] that the fullness was in Christ. And by
[45:45] and how we know God is we see his son,
[45:48] we know Jesus Christ. That also is the
[45:52] same desire that he has for the church.
[45:54] So just as he would manifest himself in
[45:57] Jesus Christ, he wants to have that same
[46:00] preeminence within his people, within
[46:02] his church, within his bride. And uh
[46:05] that is the the
[46:08] the theme that we're ministering on. And
[46:11] just to give it a title maybe to grab
[46:13] your attention and set a platform, it's
[46:16] first place
[46:18] matters. And if those, you know, in in
[46:22] recent events and competitive sports and
[46:24] things like that, uh we all want to
[46:26] strive for first place. It shouldn't be
[46:29] whether it be uh a job interview,
[46:32] whether it be uh whatever you would
[46:34] find. There's a there's a pretty
[46:36] probably innate concept within mankind
[46:39] that first place matters. Whether it's
[46:42] because there's a prize, because it's
[46:44] recognition, but there's you want to get
[46:47] passion stirred up within mankind. Uh
[46:50] you would say we're striving for first
[46:52] place. Uh a lot of businesses, their
[46:55] motto would be we're going to play to
[46:57] win. We're we're we're not going for
[46:59] second place. We're going to be the
[47:00] best. Anybody who really does anything,
[47:03] if they're really just already content
[47:05] with not being first place, you know,
[47:08] it's really not, I would say, the
[47:10] representation of God. There should be
[47:13] something a pull in you for first place.
[47:15] And we find that this is the very also
[47:19] for that position, for that first place.
[47:21] This is not just uh uh without conflict.
[47:26] Okay? Because there's a position to be
[47:28] had. There can only be one in in the
[47:31] terminology. First, I guess it's the
[47:33] number one, right? It it's not the first
[47:35] place isn't represented by two. It's not
[47:38] represented by three. It's the number
[47:40] one. So, there's there's in it even in
[47:43] its simplest form. First place is very
[47:47] self-explanatory. There's only one first
[47:50] place. And and that's probably why it's
[47:53] so contentious, right? is because if
[47:55] someone takes that spot, there's someone
[47:57] who is left out of that position. And in
[48:02] in the modern events there there's
[48:04] there's a lot of talk about uh people
[48:07] who are unfairly obtaining first place.
[48:11] They have no right to the first place.
[48:14] They're not the rightful owners. They've
[48:16] strived uh it with an unfair competitive
[48:19] advantage. there's been something that
[48:21] many would say negates their claim to
[48:24] first place. They would they would say
[48:26] it's not fair. They do not belong in
[48:28] first place. And one of the things that
[48:31] we would recognize is the deceit of
[48:34] taking first place, the deceit of
[48:36] wanting to take a position or a
[48:38] preeminence that is not uh theirs is a
[48:41] devil attribute.
[48:44] Deception and deceit is a characteristic
[48:48] of the evil one. It he is a liar. He's
[48:51] always been a liar and he's always
[48:53] wanted to exalt himself to a place of
[48:56] position that is not his to have. And
[49:00] that's uh what I would want you to
[49:02] understand is that this position of
[49:05] first place is uh very subtly contended
[49:08] for within our lives. And and you know
[49:12] what I want to present to you is that
[49:14] there's only one holder of first place
[49:16] and that's Christ. There's no other
[49:19] person that belongs in the position of
[49:21] preeminence within the position of first
[49:23] place in our lives but Christ. As we
[49:26] read the scripture, all things were made
[49:28] by him and for him. And it's when we
[49:31] forget who the main thing is, what it's
[49:34] all about is that we will find ourselves
[49:37] not being victorious. As brother Billy
[49:39] said, and I will always remember, the
[49:41] main thing is keeping the main thing the
[49:44] main thing.
[49:47] It's beautiful. The main thing is
[49:49] keeping the main thing the main thing.
[49:51] The main thing is Christ. It it it is
[49:54] that simple. It's in that we have
[49:56] victory. It's in that we have power to
[49:58] overcome. And anytime we're we're
[50:01] confused, it's because we haven't
[50:04] understood that he's still the creator.
[50:06] He's still the one who created it all.
[50:08] For him, by him, all things are made.
[50:11] And we don't have to be the ones who've
[50:13] asserted ourselves and our own thinking,
[50:15] our own ability to a place that is not
[50:18] his. We can be still and know that he's
[50:22] God. But it's when we try to understand
[50:24] things and lean upon our own
[50:25] understanding and try to solve things
[50:27] ourselves, we'll find that we lose our
[50:30] peace. We lose our joy. We become
[50:31] unsettled and things become more
[50:33] complicated. And it's because we're
[50:35] continuing with the deceiver.
[50:38] He wants to draw you off sides. He wants
[50:40] to do something to put himself back in a
[50:43] position. And that position that he has
[50:46] access to you is in your mind. It's in
[50:48] your reasoning. It's in our makebelief.
[50:50] It's within our intellectual
[50:51] understanding. Even if it be of the
[50:53] right thing, we need to go beyond that.
[50:57] Because if we just leave it there, then
[50:58] that is the realm in which we will
[51:00] battle things. Right? Then the truth in
[51:02] our intellectual understanding is really
[51:04] just as good as the intellectual
[51:07] understanding of something that is not
[51:08] the truth. But we have the power of the
[51:11] spirit. And and that's um something John
[51:15] would say in John 6:63. Jesus Christ
[51:18] speaking, "It is the spirit that
[51:20] quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing.
[51:22] The words that I speak unto you, they
[51:24] are spirit and they are life."
[51:27] Now we I I would hope that we don't
[51:29] become trinitarian in our thinking that
[51:31] somehow now we think that it's the word,
[51:33] the word, the word, the word and that
[51:35] somehow that's different than the
[51:36] spirit. The spirit and the word are the
[51:39] very same thing. If you think that you
[51:41] can make it by just some intellectual
[51:43] understanding of the word and it can't
[51:45] be anointed word, then you're dry.
[51:46] You're dead. You're formal and you've
[51:48] departed from the very words of Jesus
[51:50] Christ. Because Jesus Christ himself
[51:52] said, "The words that I speak unto you,
[51:54] they are spirit.
[51:56] And we don't have a trinitarian thinking
[51:58] that somehow thinks that when the spirit
[52:00] comes, it's not the word. I mean, if if
[52:03] it's the spirit, it is the word. It's
[52:05] not contrary. It you can't separate
[52:07] them. I would I it is confounding that
[52:10] somehow we've become trinitarian in our
[52:12] thinking that when the spirit moves, we
[52:14] think it's somehow any less word.
[52:20] Is it a is it a different person?
[52:23] It's Christ the word. And matter of
[52:25] fact, that gets us out of our comfort
[52:27] zone, right? Because as the wind blows,
[52:29] as the spirit moves, sometimes it takes
[52:31] us beyond our comfort zone. We don't
[52:33] know what it's going to do. You know,
[52:35] but it's going to water the seed that's
[52:37] in you. Amen. It's going to it's going
[52:40] to bring things to manifestation. It's
[52:41] going to bring things to maturity. It's
[52:43] going to quicken things. And that's what
[52:45] I love about the promise of the spirit.
[52:46] It's life. It's a lifegiver. It would be
[52:49] the rod of Aaron sitting in the in the
[52:51] presence of the Lord would come and it
[52:53] would bloom and it would bring forth and
[52:55] it would bud and it would bring forth
[52:56] fruit. And I find in my life if if the
[52:59] presence of the Lord comes in my life,
[53:00] the contrast of things starts to grow.
[53:03] It it just it's just an effect. If I if
[53:06] I be if I get into the presence of God,
[53:08] it w it's not long behind that. It seems
[53:10] like my flesh has the ability just to
[53:12] bring forth something that's just like,
[53:15] "What was that? Yes, but I find that
[53:19] that's the necessity of it because in
[53:20] that I'm willing to die as a son of God.
[53:23] I'm like, God, I don't I'm tired of the
[53:25] make believe. I I want you to have the
[53:28] preeminence. I know there's a power in
[53:29] your word to overcome. I I want to die
[53:33] to those things that are not of you that
[53:34] you might live. And we're not afraid of
[53:37] the correction.
[53:39] We're not afraid of the perfecting.
[53:41] We're not afraid of the contrast that
[53:43] the presence of God causes. Amen. You
[53:46] know, it it it it is the desperation and
[53:49] the thirst that's going to cause us to
[53:50] need more of him to overcome. We don't
[53:53] want to make a a a contract with the
[53:56] devil that is somehow I will not get
[53:58] desperate and I'm not going to become
[54:00] fanatical if you just let me carry on a
[54:03] a form of mediocrity and you just let me
[54:06] pass as a as a as a Christian that we'll
[54:10] just stay here. But no, there's there's
[54:12] a contending. There's a pressing.
[54:15] There's a there's a desire for a first
[54:17] place that we want Christ to have.
[54:19] There's a preeminence that we want the
[54:21] Lord to have in our lives.
[54:25] And that's not going to be possible
[54:26] without letting the spirit have
[54:28] preeminence. I I find that just in my
[54:31] own life, that's a desire and a thirsty
[54:34] I I have is that the presence of the
[54:36] Lord would so anoint and saturate my
[54:38] life that there was there is no room for
[54:41] the devil to come in and disturb that
[54:43] atmosphere. I want to be aware of his
[54:45] presence. Um even as a young Christian,
[54:48] I remember a time where I I was carrying
[54:51] a a fence. we're helping put up a wooden
[54:53] fence and it and when you're in the
[54:55] flesh and you're exerting yourself and
[54:57] you're doing physical labor, you're
[54:59] already kind of pressing into the carnal
[55:01] and and um I uh you know, brothers like,
[55:06] "Oh, you're pressing the fence that way.
[55:08] Now carry it this way." You know, and
[55:09] and even in my spirit, I was like, you
[55:12] know, I don't want to I don't want to be
[55:13] that way. There's a check. There's
[55:16] something. And we want to always be
[55:18] tender to that. We always want to be
[55:19] sensitive to it. And it's by being in
[55:22] his presence that the contrast is made
[55:24] manifest. A lot of times you're really
[55:26] not, you know, you feel like, you know,
[55:28] you you do something like that, you're
[55:29] getting worse, but that's because he's
[55:31] moving
[55:32] you away from that
[55:36] uh fleshly manifestation of that person
[55:38] that you really are not. And you're
[55:41] starting to manifest a heavenly image.
[55:43] And you feel like you're worse. And in
[55:47] young believers, young Christians, a lot
[55:48] of times you feel like as you start this
[55:50] journey that somehow things are getting
[55:52] worse because the contrast is becoming
[55:55] greater. But I I I have a good news for
[55:58] you. Really, what's happening is the
[56:00] light is becoming brighter and that
[56:02] causes a contrast to those things which
[56:04] are not heavenly. And so do not be
[56:07] condemned because your flesh is being
[56:09] exposed for what it is. But be be
[56:12] thankful that there's a conviction that
[56:14] there's a Holy Spirit, that there's a a
[56:16] a light shining in your life to expose
[56:19] those things and be quick to repent and
[56:21] to ask forgiveness and ask for the power
[56:23] to overcome that the Lord would be
[56:26] glorified because it's not our
[56:28] righteousness. Amen. It's it's about
[56:31] preeminence. It's about giving first
[56:33] place to him. It's about letting him
[56:36] express himself. Amen. Remember, just as
[56:40] he wanted to express himself in Christ,
[56:42] as he would make himself known, he wants
[56:44] to do the same in you.
[56:47] So, no man's seen the father at any
[56:50] time, but the son has declared him. You
[56:53] know, we we understand what Christ was
[56:56] was the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[56:58] dwelt in Christ. So, if you want to know
[57:02] who God is, Jesus Christ. Amen. You can
[57:06] look at his life. You could look at how
[57:08] he was born. He was born in a manger. Uh
[57:11] there was no beauty in him that we
[57:14] should desire him. If you want to know
[57:16] God, it was declared without controversy
[57:20] in Jesus Christ. So that was because God
[57:24] decided to do it that way. Okay? And it
[57:28] gives us hope. It is our the forerunner.
[57:32] It is the first fruits. It is the very
[57:34] expression of what he's called us to be.
[57:37] Our example is Christ
[57:40] and and in all things we want to be
[57:47] Christlike. In Isaiah 14 and and I want
[57:50] to just I felt it was necessary. So
[57:52] we'll we'll press on this and we'll uh
[57:55] speak to it. Isaiah 14 and 12. How art
[57:58] thou how art thou fallen, oh Lucifer,
[58:01] son of the morning? How art thou cut
[58:04] down to the ground which didest weaken
[58:06] the nations? For thou hast said in thine
[58:10] heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will
[58:14] exalt my throne above the stars of God.
[58:18] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[58:20] congregation in the sides of the north.
[58:23] So we get a glimpse now into the mindset
[58:26] of the devil, of Lucifer, of of the evil
[58:29] one, of the of the angel of light. And I
[58:32] I found it something. He says, "I will
[58:35] sit. I will exalt." It's a very a
[58:39] pronunciation of a self-will.
[58:42] An I will and I will and I will. A very
[58:45] proudful, a very boastful approach, a
[58:48] very uh intent of purpose. I will. And
[58:51] that is the that personifies itself in
[58:53] man. When man thinks they could do God a
[58:55] service, when man thinks he could
[58:57] accomplish something, it's often done
[58:59] with the attitude of I will. I will do
[59:02] this. I will do this. And our
[59:04] sufficiency is in and of oursel. It's in
[59:07] Christ. And and the only way for him to
[59:10] have preeminence is if we reckon
[59:11] ourselves dead at Calvary with him. That
[59:14] so we have to die to the ability of
[59:17] self-will. We have to master the thought
[59:19] of human ability. We have to consider
[59:22] that we are nothing and he is
[59:23] everything. And it it is a there's so
[59:27] many ways that the scripture expresses
[59:28] it,
[59:30] but
[59:31] notice there is somebody who's wanting
[59:34] to take the place in the preeminence.
[59:38] So there's got to be an awareness that
[59:40] the enemy is set about to take first
[59:43] place.
[59:46] He's exposed in this day. We know what
[59:49] he did even gaining access through the
[59:51] titles of the trinitarian teaching to to
[59:54] come into the church and sit on the
[59:56] throne of God and be exalted as if he is
[59:58] God and receive worship. And he receives
[1:00:00] worship by uh presenting God as someone
[1:00:03] he is not. But when we uh you know the
[1:00:07] very things that we said it's not an I
[1:00:09] will but it's seek first the kingdom of
[1:00:11] heaven. There's an abandoning of
[1:00:13] self-will.
[1:00:15] There's an abandonment of not there's as
[1:00:17] Christ person he said it not my will but
[1:00:20] thine be done the very example of Christ
[1:00:24] not my will and not notice the contrast
[1:00:27] I will not my will
[1:00:30] and that's what we want to declare
[1:00:32] tonight is not our will Lord I I'm I'm
[1:00:35] done with my thinking I've recognized
[1:00:37] that all I can do as a man it doesn't
[1:00:41] have eternal value Lord but if you would
[1:00:43] work through me then it would be great
[1:00:45] things. Not my will, Lord, but thine be
[1:00:48] done. You know, a lamb has no rights. A
[1:00:52] lamb lays down his rights. And that's
[1:00:54] what Christ did. He laid down his life.
[1:00:56] Brother Brandham in one place would say
[1:00:57] he had a right to do things. But but but
[1:01:00] for the prize that was set before him
[1:01:02] for you, he laid down it all.
[1:01:05] And that's our opportunity is to lay it
[1:01:09] all down that he could be glorified.
[1:01:14] And what I would uh say is in this hour
[1:01:18] it comes down to something so fine as
[1:01:20] the scripture would say it would be so
[1:01:22] close it could deceive the very elect if
[1:01:24] it was possible. And what we're
[1:01:26] challenged to do is not leave it at an
[1:01:28] intellectual believing.
[1:01:32] Right? So that is not for me to discern
[1:01:34] because it comes through the gateway of
[1:01:36] the mind. We do have to first believe
[1:01:38] it, but we don't believe in letting it
[1:01:41] just sit there and not be quickened, not
[1:01:44] be made real, not to become a
[1:01:45] revelation. We don't want it to just be
[1:01:47] a lifeless uh understanding and
[1:01:50] believing from the heart. He says in
[1:01:52] paragraph 39, this is 570623. Now, if
[1:01:55] you try to bluff that, it won't work. If
[1:01:58] you try to reason it in your mind, say,
[1:02:00] "Yes, God's word is right. I believe
[1:02:02] that. I believe it will come to pass. I
[1:02:05] think that." Now, if that's
[1:02:07] intellectually, you'll just might as
[1:02:09] well stop thinking it. Until something
[1:02:12] comes down in the inside of you that
[1:02:14] just says it's so, and that's all there
[1:02:17] is to it. There's not enough demons out
[1:02:19] of torment could shake you from it. It's
[1:02:22] something on the inside called the
[1:02:24] heart. There's where real faith finds
[1:02:26] its resting place. And I got good news
[1:02:28] for you. He's given you the gift of
[1:02:30] faith. You have to recognize the
[1:02:32] preeminence of the Christ that's in you.
[1:02:35] Greater is he that's in you than he
[1:02:36] that's in the world. It is the
[1:02:38] intellectual man that is just this. But
[1:02:42] so much greater is the life of Christ
[1:02:44] that's in you that says amen to the
[1:02:45] word. That is something down in your
[1:02:47] heart that can't be explained. And you
[1:02:50] can have a peace and a comfort in what
[1:02:52] that is. That is Christ in you. Amen.
[1:02:54] That's beyond the
[1:02:56] mind. This is uh perfect strength,
[1:02:58] perfect weakness. Paragraph 5261 1119.
[1:03:02] Notice that it takes the weakest and the
[1:03:04] rejected. And practically every hero God
[1:03:07] ever had on the front line was this type
[1:03:09] of person. A person that was rejected, a
[1:03:12] person that thought he was insufficient.
[1:03:14] A person that had no ability at all.
[1:03:17] Then that person's just in good shape so
[1:03:20] that God can start using them. That's
[1:03:22] right. That's when we feel they feel
[1:03:24] that they can't. They haven't got
[1:03:27] nothing. That's when God can take a hold
[1:03:29] of them and do something with them. See
[1:03:32] when but we are thinking that we are
[1:03:35] able to do it then God can't use us
[1:03:37] because we're wanting to do it ourselves
[1:03:40] and then the other side we get these
[1:03:43] feelings. I love how he's always
[1:03:45] bringing a balance
[1:03:48] and we think that we're insufficient and
[1:03:51] we want to do it but then if we just
[1:03:54] listen to the call of God that's the
[1:03:56] very thing that God wants us to get into
[1:03:59] that kind of shape so he can when we are
[1:04:03] insufficient ourselves then we are
[1:04:05] subjects to yield to the god's spirit
[1:04:08] so that it's in the yielding it's in the
[1:04:11] recognizing our insufficiency it is in
[1:04:14] the dying. It is in the letting go. It
[1:04:17] is in recognizing that we've come short,
[1:04:20] that we've tried, that we're unable.
[1:04:22] It's that that position of weakness
[1:04:25] where we finally just let go and let God
[1:04:29] and then he can as we
[1:04:34] yield and when we are insufficient
[1:04:36] ourselves, then we are subjects to yield
[1:04:38] to God's spirit. As long as we think
[1:04:40] that we can do it, then we can't do it.
[1:04:42] But if we get to a place where we know
[1:04:45] we can't do it, then we can yield
[1:04:47] ourselves to God and he does it. So then
[1:04:49] if it's us trying to do it, we'll fail.
[1:04:53] But if we'll just yield ourselves to
[1:04:55] God, then God then God can't fail.
[1:04:59] There's only one thing that God cannot
[1:05:01] do, and that's fail. He can do anything
[1:05:04] else but fail, but he cannot fail. So,
[1:05:07] as long as we're trying ourselves and
[1:05:10] depending on our own abilities and so
[1:05:12] forth, well, we'll do nothing. But when
[1:05:14] we get to the place where we know we're
[1:05:16] nothing, then God can use us.
[1:05:21] The important thing, one of the
[1:05:22] important things is that we must master.
[1:05:24] Now, remember this, and especially you
[1:05:27] young preachers and lay members alike,
[1:05:29] so he didn't leave it with just one of
[1:05:31] us. There's one thing that we've got to
[1:05:33] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[1:05:36] desire in our life. How many wants to
[1:05:37] fulfill God's desire in our life?
[1:05:40] There's one thing we have to
[1:05:42] master. The thought of human
[1:05:45] ability. That's
[1:05:47] hard. We decide a plan in a way that
[1:05:50] we're going to accomplish things. We
[1:05:52] have plans for our lives. We have
[1:05:55] visions. We we and we know the things
[1:05:58] that we want done. And we don't
[1:06:01] understand all the ways the Lord will
[1:06:04] lead us. I will say that you will be
[1:06:06] fulfilled in Christ. That as you yield
[1:06:10] yourself to him and his desire in in
[1:06:12] your life, you will be fulfilled in
[1:06:14] Christ. That the very things that we may
[1:06:16] articulate that we feel are going to
[1:06:18] satisfy the longings in our life and our
[1:06:20] heart's desires, God will do those
[1:06:23] things because there's a deep calling,
[1:06:25] but it may not be in the way we expect
[1:06:27] them to be fulfilled. You know, a young
[1:06:29] man has a desire for success and a
[1:06:31] desire for prosperity. I would say if
[1:06:33] you win one soul for the kingdom of
[1:06:35] heaven, you're successful.
[1:06:38] And who knows where God has to put you
[1:06:40] and the things that you must go through
[1:06:42] to do that. But in the economy of God,
[1:06:44] you've done great things
[1:06:46] if you win one
[1:06:48] soul. You're more successful than an
[1:06:51] Elon Musk.
[1:06:54] I I I hope that our affections and our
[1:06:57] desires are really not set upon the
[1:06:59] wealth of this world because you will
[1:07:00] find that it leaves you wanting for
[1:07:02] more.
[1:07:05] It's not going to satisfy. You may have
[1:07:07] to go through a very hard trial to have
[1:07:10] that broken down because I the examples
[1:07:13] in the world of people who have not
[1:07:14] obtained peace through wealth are
[1:07:16] prolific. I think I was just reading in
[1:07:18] the news where a Bitcoin billionaire was
[1:07:20] tormenting another billionaire for more
[1:07:23] Bitcoin
[1:07:27] and people are crazy.
[1:07:30] I don't know where that comes from, but
[1:07:33] if that's your reality, you're you're
[1:07:36] torturing yourself.
[1:07:42] Luke 9 uh verse 23. And he said unto
[1:07:46] them, "If any man will come after me,
[1:07:48] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:07:51] cross daily and follow me. For whosoever
[1:07:54] will save his life shall lose it. But
[1:07:56] whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:07:59] sake, the same shall save it." That is,
[1:08:03] I think, the
[1:08:04] quantification of mastering the thought
[1:08:07] of human ability.
[1:08:09] That's right. I It's laying your life
[1:08:12] down. Yeah. the the the at at its most
[1:08:16] rudimentary
[1:08:18] form,
[1:08:19] self-preservation is the most basic of
[1:08:22] human
[1:08:23] instincts. It is the that it's the very
[1:08:27] thing that is very hard to control.
[1:08:30] And and I can testify that in my as a
[1:08:33] young Christian and and not to boast in
[1:08:36] any way, but even foolishly, I there's
[1:08:38] been times where I did not want to see
[1:08:40] someone die. and I it to great pearl not
[1:08:43] even thinking about those around me
[1:08:45] interjected myself in a in a situation
[1:08:48] um and uh in to to try to save someone's
[1:08:52] life and and I and I'm not sure to this
[1:08:55] day but that person and it when I uh
[1:08:58] there's people are about to stab him and
[1:09:00] I jumped in and laid on top of them and
[1:09:03] I lost half a tooth over this and this
[1:09:05] was in Mexico and the person regained
[1:09:08] their consciousness and some of the
[1:09:10] people that attacking him. He threw him
[1:09:11] over a wall and I don't know if that
[1:09:13] person died.
[1:09:15] So just in in our uh I guess what I'm
[1:09:19] trying to say is you you have no thought
[1:09:22] you you as a Christian it's not about
[1:09:25] self it's for others but you need the
[1:09:27] word of God and wisdom to guide that.
[1:09:30] Okay. You you can't just be uh uh you
[1:09:34] know with abandoned, but we we want
[1:09:36] wisdom. And and the word says that if
[1:09:38] any man lack wisdom, let him ask his
[1:09:40] father. Your life is to accomplish
[1:09:42] something. And when you're willing to
[1:09:44] lay it down and yield it, then God can
[1:09:46] use it. But let's not use it foolishly
[1:09:49] for vain things. Let's use it for the
[1:09:52] kingdom of God, for the furtherance of
[1:09:54] his kingdom, that souls can be saved,
[1:09:55] that he can be glorified, to the shaking
[1:09:58] of Satan's kingdom, to God's glory that
[1:10:00] magnifies holiness, that shows rugged
[1:10:02] Christian living the way it should be
[1:10:03] lived, that men would be men.
[1:10:06] You know, I I would say this myself, and
[1:10:08] this is just from my heart. If if
[1:10:10] sisters are having a problem, there's
[1:10:12] one place it begins, and that's with the
[1:10:14] men. If we showed them what was
[1:10:16] important and it really was on display
[1:10:18] in our life, that would be inspiring
[1:10:20] enough.
[1:10:22] So let the men be men.
[1:10:25] The things we give attention to are
[1:10:27] glorifying God. That the things that we
[1:10:30] give honor to are the things that are
[1:10:31] are meaningful. That'll make the
[1:10:34] difference.
[1:10:35] And a lot of this is is just in my heart
[1:10:38] because in preeminence and position,
[1:10:40] there's a headship. And and when we get
[1:10:43] out of our place of letting God have the
[1:10:45] preeminence, then we aren't where we're
[1:10:47] supposed to be. And God has an economy.
[1:10:50] He has a kingdom. And it's it is that
[1:10:52] which uh has a
[1:10:55] manifold expression. And the in the and
[1:10:58] uh maybe we'll get there if we can
[1:11:07] hurry. So there's a redeeming back.
[1:11:09] There's a restoration. There's an
[1:11:10] understanding of where we were. We were
[1:11:12] in Christ in the beginning that Eve came
[1:11:14] out of Adam. There's a all of this fits
[1:11:17] because in order to give preeminence, we
[1:11:19] have to recognize from whom we are made
[1:11:22] and by whom we consist, right? So there
[1:11:25] would be an honor a child would give a
[1:11:27] parent as an understanding of headship.
[1:11:29] A children honoring their father. Why?
[1:11:31] Because they wouldn't be here without
[1:11:33] him. Seems pretty basic, right?
[1:11:36] Uh but that's the very thing that Christ
[1:11:38] would come and say you've made the the
[1:11:40] law of God of none effect by the
[1:11:41] teachings of men. Because one of the
[1:11:43] very things that they would do is not
[1:11:44] honor their parents. And what that I
[1:11:46] they said it's Corbin and it was kind of
[1:11:48] hard for me to understand. I looked into
[1:11:50] it and researched it. The what they
[1:11:52] would say is look as you've raised me as
[1:11:54] a child, you've done it unto God. So all
[1:11:56] the things that you've done for me, just
[1:11:58] pretend or let's say it was as unto the
[1:12:01] Lord. So as as you've done it unto the
[1:12:03] Lord and me as your child, then you
[1:12:05] can't ask anything in return of God, can
[1:12:08] you? So we're
[1:12:11] even. And then negate the responsibility
[1:12:14] to honor the parent by saying somehow as
[1:12:17] the parent has raised the child, you've
[1:12:19] done it unto the
[1:12:20] Lord. See you later, Mom and
[1:12:22] Dad. I'm going to go my way now and live
[1:12:26] my life. I I'm not going to have respect
[1:12:29] unto you. and and the understanding.
[1:12:31] Now, imagine the circumspectfulness. The
[1:12:34] child that was raised through fatherly
[1:12:36] and motherly care, that didn't have a
[1:12:39] hope, that didn't have a future, now is
[1:12:42] going to neglect a parent that's in
[1:12:44] need.
[1:12:46] The callousness of relationship. When
[1:12:49] you get things out of position, it's a
[1:12:51] relationship
[1:12:52] issue. And that's what we need to
[1:12:55] recognize is that it's our relationship
[1:12:57] with Christ. He doesn't desire anything
[1:12:59] else but first place. If you do, if if
[1:13:02] you're not willing to forsake father,
[1:13:04] mother, houses, lands, you're not worthy
[1:13:06] of the kingdom. There is no you have to
[1:13:09] lay your Isaac down. There is there is
[1:13:12] we can't have any thought of
[1:13:14] self-preservation in this. We have to be
[1:13:18] willing to die and die daily that Christ
[1:13:21] can live. And that's the only way that
[1:13:23] Christ is going to be able to express
[1:13:24] himself in the individual. So, it's
[1:13:26] Christ expressing himself individual in
[1:13:29] the individual, whether he's
[1:13:31] intellectual or whether he's not. Don't
[1:13:34] know his ABCs. Half the apostles didn't
[1:13:36] know it. That's right. But they knowed
[1:13:39] Christ. They never taken heed to Peter
[1:13:41] and John knowing that they had been out
[1:13:43] of some seminary. They said, "Take
[1:13:45] heed." And notice that they had been
[1:13:47] with Christ. When they healed the lame
[1:13:50] man, see at the gate, they noticed they
[1:13:53] had been with Christ. The new birth is
[1:13:56] Christ is a revelation. God has revealed
[1:13:59] to him you. The great mystery and that's
[1:14:03] a new birth. Now what are you going to
[1:14:06] do when you get all them grouped
[1:14:08] together? That's us. The revelation
[1:14:10] perfectly in harmony and God expressing
[1:14:12] it through his word by the same actions,
[1:14:15] the same thing that he did making the
[1:14:16] word manifest. Oh, it's the church only
[1:14:19] knew its position. It will one day. Then
[1:14:21] the rapture will go when it knows what
[1:14:24] it is. And that quote, it it deserves a
[1:14:28] prominent place. It deserves to be
[1:14:30] popular. It hasn't changed. It's not
[1:14:33] cliche. It's not buzzwords. It's it's an
[1:14:36] it's a voice expressed to us by a
[1:14:38] prophet. That is our promise. We can say
[1:14:41] it again and get excited about it. We
[1:14:44] have a right to be excited about it.
[1:14:46] We've received a prophet's message
[1:14:47] that's transforming us. Amen. We can
[1:14:50] recognize our position.
[1:14:52] And our position isn't one where we're
[1:14:56] we're without Christ. He's the head. You
[1:14:59] know, you you the big brother syndrome's
[1:15:02] real. I'm with him. That's right.
[1:15:06] I We can take comfort in knowing we're
[1:15:08] not doing any of this without him. We're
[1:15:11] not on our own. He hasn't left us. He
[1:15:13] hasn't taken us this far to leave us.
[1:15:15] We're not going by our feelings. But
[1:15:17] he's promised us and we can count on it.
[1:15:21] He's doing the work.
[1:15:24] You know, and and testimonies have a
[1:15:27] prominent place. So, as you testify that
[1:15:30] Christ is with you, the devil would try
[1:15:32] to draw you off sides and think that
[1:15:34] somehow you heaping glory to yourself
[1:15:36] or, you know, he always wants to do
[1:15:38] something to belittle us. And I I was
[1:15:41] thinking of the Tower of David and he
[1:15:43] would have all those shields on it. He
[1:15:44] said a thousand bucklers were on the
[1:15:46] tower of David. And historians would
[1:15:48] say, well, you know, there's nothing
[1:15:50] that we really know what those shields
[1:15:51] were, but it was it's a sign of strength
[1:15:53] at least, you know, because they're
[1:15:54] bucklers. So, as the as the the Song of
[1:15:57] Solomon would say, it says the tower of
[1:15:58] David and it has a thousand shields on
[1:16:00] it. But I there's other people who say
[1:16:02] those shields were the the enemies of
[1:16:04] David that had been vanquished, that had
[1:16:06] been defeated and they were hung as
[1:16:08] trophies and momentos upon the tower and
[1:16:10] they were testimonies of the of the
[1:16:12] victories that have been won. And it's
[1:16:14] to remind the people and there's got to
[1:16:16] be something as a believer you have to
[1:16:18] remind yourself of the testimonies of
[1:16:20] what the Lord's done in your life. It
[1:16:22] wasn't you. It wasn't you who defeated
[1:16:24] the lion. It wasn't you, but it was God
[1:16:26] who delivered into your hands. And you
[1:16:28] could look at those and you put them on
[1:16:30] display in a place of preeminence.
[1:16:33] You give them a place that goes before
[1:16:36] you that stands as a testimony. And you
[1:16:38] look at them and you say, "What are
[1:16:39] these trophies?" Hallelujah. It was my
[1:16:42] pride. Hallelujah. It was my self-worth.
[1:16:45] It was my doubt. It was my fear. It was
[1:16:48] it was it was my depression.
[1:16:51] And you and you hold that up as a
[1:16:53] testimony and you say, "Look at the
[1:16:55] enemy. He's been defeated." Amen. And
[1:16:57] the same one who gave me that trophy and
[1:16:59] it's on display. It's in a place. It's
[1:17:01] not hid. It's on a tower. It's raised
[1:17:04] up. It's a defeated foe. You You think
[1:17:07] of Christ in the in the type of the
[1:17:09] serpent being put upon the cross? And
[1:17:11] always struck me, you know, why are they
[1:17:12] putting it, you know, the snake's bad?
[1:17:15] The snake's bad. Why are they looking at
[1:17:17] a snake upon a stick and getting healed?
[1:17:19] It's a serpent. But it was the very
[1:17:22] essence of Christ becoming sin
[1:17:25] of of dealing. All those things that are
[1:17:27] trophies was purchased by Calvary.
[1:17:31] So those trophies aren't your
[1:17:33] accomplishment. That's right. They're
[1:17:35] his accomplishment. It's what he's done.
[1:17:38] Our boast is in the Lord. He's the one
[1:17:41] who's victorious. And and he and he's
[1:17:44] going to continue to win those victories
[1:17:45] in our life. If he if I be lifted up,
[1:17:48] I'll draw all men unto me.
[1:17:51] Christ in your life is the things that
[1:17:53] you know him by relationship
[1:17:56] in in the simplicity of it. If he's if
[1:17:59] he woke you up this morning and gave you
[1:18:01] breath, you could just say, "Thank you,
[1:18:04] Lord, for giving me breath." And if you
[1:18:07] just thank him for the things that he's
[1:18:08] done, look, there's none good but God.
[1:18:11] There is none good but God. Hey, you
[1:18:14] just say that again. There's none good
[1:18:15] but God. And and I and whoever thinks
[1:18:18] they got good without God is just like
[1:18:21] saying the sun ain't the sun.
[1:18:24] It doesn't matter if they want to cover
[1:18:26] their eyes and deny it. It's God.
[1:18:30] You have to recognize that we are made
[1:18:32] in the image of God. All mankind. But
[1:18:36] there all mankind were made in the image
[1:18:38] of God. So what is it? The devil that's
[1:18:40] done things to mankind. He hates the
[1:18:42] image of God. He's the one who perverts
[1:18:44] and torments and and takes who's meant
[1:18:46] to be a son in God and a daughter of God
[1:18:48] and makes them do things they ought not.
[1:18:50] That's why you don't look at a woman
[1:18:52] unless that's a daughter of God.
[1:18:54] Amen. You you don't put once you
[1:18:57] recognize the position people are in. It
[1:19:00] causes us to change our behavior.
[1:19:03] As a son of God, you don't do things.
[1:19:05] You're a son of God meant to declare the
[1:19:07] glory of God. Amen. It's the devil
[1:19:10] that's lied and deceived and told us we
[1:19:12] we're something else. But the man even
[1:19:16] in its in the base form is made in the
[1:19:18] image of God. And there is none good but
[1:19:20] God. When man does something good even
[1:19:22] in its kindness toward mankind, that's
[1:19:24] an expression of God. There's no good
[1:19:27] but none good but God. The only reason
[1:19:29] they could even do that is because
[1:19:31] there's a God.
[1:19:34] Amen.
[1:19:41] All things are unto Christ. So, as we
[1:19:43] read in
[1:19:45] um and just we'll turn to Colossians 3.
[1:19:47] If you turn over from verse one,
[1:19:50] uh you could read all of Colossians 3
[1:19:52] and we won't do that for the sake of
[1:19:54] time, but it's
[1:19:57] a just want to look at verse 23.
[1:20:04] And whatsoever you do, do it hardedly as
[1:20:08] to the Lord and not unto men.
[1:20:13] You'll find that that is the a key to
[1:20:15] victory in your life. Yes, sir. All
[1:20:19] things that you do, right? Do it to the
[1:20:24] Lord, not unto men. If you don't
[1:20:27] recognize Christ in it, then don't do
[1:20:30] it.
[1:20:32] If you're not doing it as unto the Lord
[1:20:34] and it's not worthy to be done as unto
[1:20:36] the Lord, don't do it. But if it's worth
[1:20:39] doing, do it as unto the Lord. And even
[1:20:42] in the scripture that was before that,
[1:20:44] it's talking about uh servants giving to
[1:20:47] their masters the position that's
[1:20:50] theirs. And then and this is profound
[1:20:53] really. It says, don't just do it as
[1:20:55] though you're pleasing the master. That
[1:20:57] would be good enough. It would seem
[1:20:58] like, okay, you've been given a a a task
[1:21:01] to do and you would do it and I think I
[1:21:03] would as well for the recognition of
[1:21:05] those who I'm doing it for and that
[1:21:07] would be a worthy reward to job well
[1:21:10] done. Man,
[1:21:12] Ben, you can carry bricks like nobody
[1:21:15] else can carry them and I cannot do
[1:21:17] that. Job well done. You're a hos,
[1:21:20] right? I can't do that all day long. But
[1:21:24] that's not even what he tells us to do.
[1:21:27] He says you're basically your reward is
[1:21:29] in as undoing it as unto the Lord. So in
[1:21:33] your heart now we're getting back to the
[1:21:35] relationship because he's basically
[1:21:37] saying
[1:21:38] guys I'm with you. You do it unto me.
[1:21:43] Nothing could separate us. That's right.
[1:21:45] You don't have to worry about the
[1:21:47] recognition of man. But do it unto me.
[1:21:51] I'm with you.
[1:21:54] And it gives you victory. That's right.
[1:21:57] It gives you peace.
[1:21:59] He's in control.
[1:22:02] He's the reason I'm doing it.
[1:22:05] And we just have to bring back Christ to
[1:22:07] first place and recognize him as being
[1:22:09] in the position of
[1:22:12] preeminence. But if you would, I think,
[1:22:15] dive into
[1:22:17] that, there would be a a fleshly
[1:22:20] element, especially when you're putting
[1:22:23] someone in rule over you. If you back up
[1:22:24] to verse
[1:22:27] 22, servants obey in all things your
[1:22:30] masters according to the flesh,
[1:22:35] not with eye service and as men
[1:22:38] pleasers,
[1:22:40] but in singleness of heart, fearing God.
[1:22:44] And whatsoever ye do, do it heartedly as
[1:22:48] to the Lord and and not unto men,
[1:22:52] knowing that the
[1:22:54] Lord ye shall receive the reward of an
[1:22:57] inheritance, for ye serve the Lord
[1:23:02] Christ.
[1:23:05] We uh are not working for a heaven
[1:23:08] earthly reward. It's a heavenly reward.
[1:23:27] Amen. We're not going to get there.
[1:23:31] I I'm going to just uh do some
[1:23:35] maybe quick reading, but in the in that
[1:23:39] there's a place of being a prisoner to
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ.
[1:23:43] Okay. If you can in the natural could
[1:23:45] recognize that you could submit yourself
[1:23:47] to an earthly master to somebody who
[1:23:50] would who would give an order and you
[1:23:52] could be a manleaser and you could do it
[1:23:54] for earthly recognition then we can say
[1:23:56] that we as Paul I'm a prisoner of
[1:23:59] Christ. I'm doing what I do uh because
[1:24:02] not with my understanding what I would
[1:24:04] think would be the right thing to do.
[1:24:05] Even the things that I think would be
[1:24:07] beneficial to the kingdom of heaven, but
[1:24:09] there's a check. There's a a heartfelt
[1:24:11] relationship. There's something I'm a
[1:24:12] witness to that outside of his will and
[1:24:15] outside of his leading, I do not have a
[1:24:18] thought coming. I only want to do that
[1:24:21] of the will of the father. I'm a
[1:24:23] prisoner to Christ. that communion and
[1:24:25] that relationship is one by reckoning
[1:24:28] ourselves dead at Calvary with Christ
[1:24:32] that Christ can live in us.
[1:24:34] And it's this is
[1:24:37] uh paragraph 148 in Christ of the
[1:24:43] mystery and it and it maybe I back up to
[1:24:46] 147 and then another one the night if
[1:24:50] you don't get the tape I preached the
[1:24:51] one the other night a prisoner of Jesus
[1:24:53] Christ Paul a prisoner. See when God
[1:24:55] gets you to be his prisoner then you
[1:24:57] can't do nothing but what the spirit
[1:24:59] says do. Paul with all his great
[1:25:01] intellects, he thought he was taught by
[1:25:03] Gelia to be a great priest, a rabbi
[1:25:05] someday. And he had a high ambitions. He
[1:25:08] was intellectually a great man, great
[1:25:11] authority, great man in the nation. But
[1:25:13] he had to sacrifice every bit of it.
[1:25:16] See, to become a part of the word, to
[1:25:17] express Jesus Christ. He knowed what it
[1:25:20] was to say. He had a notion to go over
[1:25:23] someplace. Some brethren had called him,
[1:25:26] but he was forbidden by the spirit to do
[1:25:29] his own
[1:25:30] will. If people half-spiritual can pick
[1:25:33] that up. See, he was forbidden to do his
[1:25:36] own will. He could the spirit forbid
[1:25:40] him. See, he was a prisoner to Christ.
[1:25:42] than this little fort teller one day who
[1:25:46] he knowed Paul knowed he had a power to
[1:25:48] cast the devil
[1:25:50] out but he could only do it if God
[1:25:53] willed it. Day after day she followed
[1:25:56] him crying out after him. But one day
[1:25:58] the spirit gave him permission. Then he
[1:26:01] rebuked her and the spirit that was in
[1:26:03] him
[1:26:04] seeed what it was to be a
[1:26:06] prisoner. Isn't that something? He had
[1:26:08] the authority. He had the ability, but
[1:26:10] he
[1:26:11] was, if you will, checked in his spirit.
[1:26:14] He knew not to do it.
[1:26:18] As sons of God, that's the that's the
[1:26:20] supernatural offer. That's the
[1:26:21] proposition of the devil. That's where
[1:26:24] in our own understanding, we will make a
[1:26:26] mess of things. But if we can die to our
[1:26:29] own understanding that Christ could have
[1:26:31] the preeminence, then he receives the
[1:26:33] greater glory. Yes. And and this is I'm
[1:26:36] so thankful that a prophet could go in
[1:26:38] there and and bring these insights to
[1:26:40] us.
[1:26:42] Oh, if God can get him prisoners like
[1:26:44] that now, that's when he can express the
[1:26:47] preeminences. You see, he's got the man
[1:26:50] or the person so that he knows nothing
[1:26:52] but Christ. You get that? I mean, all
[1:26:55] right. That's secondly, first to and
[1:26:58] then uh first to express himself
[1:27:00] completely God in Christ. Second, to
[1:27:03] have the preeminence by this in his
[1:27:05] church, which is his body, the bride,
[1:27:08] till he could have the preeminence to
[1:27:10] express himself through them. And then
[1:27:13] thirdly, to restore the kingdom to its
[1:27:15] right position that fell by sin to the
[1:27:18] first Adam, back to where he walked in
[1:27:20] the cool of the evening with his people,
[1:27:23] talking with them, fellowshipping them
[1:27:25] with
[1:27:26] them. This is the three-fold purpose of
[1:27:29] God. We can the the promise to us and
[1:27:33] really what we've been given is is to
[1:27:35] recognize that as he expressed himself
[1:27:37] in Christ, he's doing in us. That is the
[1:27:40] very hour that we're living in is where
[1:27:41] God through the very type of what we
[1:27:43] are. A bride that how a husband's made
[1:27:46] known is is by a bride, bone of his
[1:27:48] bone, flesh of his flesh. We're
[1:27:49] fulfilling that heart call and that
[1:27:51] desire and purpose of God to have a
[1:27:54] preeminence in a people once again in
[1:27:56] this day. Yes, sir. a complete
[1:27:57] preeminence, not not a partial
[1:27:59] preeminence, not in a in a partial
[1:28:01] light, but a perfect light with a
[1:28:03] perfect character, with a perfect
[1:28:05] representation of Christ to know what he
[1:28:07] wants done with the word or stay still.
[1:28:14] And and that that is exactly it. It is a
[1:28:17] help us Lord. We wouldn't want to die to
[1:28:20] self if we didn't recognize we have a
[1:28:22] full inheritance to take possession of.
[1:28:24] And I'm not content with a partial. I'm
[1:28:27] not content without being a full
[1:28:29] manifestation. I'm not content without a
[1:28:31] full death, a full dying out, without
[1:28:33] all of the promises of God manifested in
[1:28:36] my life. I'm not
[1:28:37] content. I'm not going to sit still. I'm
[1:28:40] going to press. I'm going to die. I'm
[1:28:42] going to I'm willing to lay my life down
[1:28:44] for this gospel. I'm not willing that my
[1:28:46] brother would sit in a place of of
[1:28:49] of lukewarmness.
[1:28:53] It's not given to us to be lukewarm.
[1:28:55] There should be such a liberty in our
[1:28:57] life that we come into the house of God,
[1:28:59] we're free to worship him. That even in
[1:29:01] in the quietness of our spirit, we can
[1:29:03] say, "Thank you, Lord. You got me into
[1:29:04] your house."
[1:29:06] And that could just start to bubble up.
[1:29:10] What you've done,
[1:29:12] the enemy withtood me. And I'm here in
[1:29:14] the house of God. I'm gathered with
[1:29:17] people of precious like faith, a bride
[1:29:19] in this end time, gathered around the
[1:29:21] word of the hour, a prophet's message
[1:29:23] that's come to tell us who we are, how
[1:29:26] thankful we are. It's your goodness to
[1:29:29] us, Father.
[1:29:39] There's
[1:29:41] a a simplicity to this. You know,
[1:29:45] brother Brandham, in one place, I don't
[1:29:47] have the quote in front of me, but he
[1:29:48] talks about he was trying to as a young
[1:29:51] husband, he was trying to get to work
[1:29:53] and he's trying to build a a fire in the
[1:29:56] in the stove and he says the backdraft
[1:29:59] was coming and he had this little tin
[1:30:01] box there and he's trying to get it
[1:30:03] started before he goes and the the
[1:30:05] wind's blowing and it pushes back out
[1:30:07] the smoke and he's he's doing all his
[1:30:09] effort to start a fire. It's a very
[1:30:12] humanly I mean that's ex you need to
[1:30:14] start the fire you
[1:30:16] know he's okay in doing what he's doing
[1:30:18] he's just setting about the task of the
[1:30:21] day and he says he turned on the radio
[1:30:24] and there's a song playing it says air
[1:30:26] did you leave this mo the your room this
[1:30:28] morning did you forget to pray and it's
[1:30:32] such a it brought such a conviction to
[1:30:34] his heart he dropped down on his knees
[1:30:36] and he started to pray he recognized
[1:30:39] that he had started his day without
[1:30:41] giving God first place, without giving
[1:30:44] him the preeminence, without simply
[1:30:46] saying, "Lord, I can't do this without
[1:30:49] you." And that's ultimately what it
[1:30:52] comes down to is the relationship that
[1:30:55] we have with him. Are we allowing him to
[1:30:57] be our head? Are we allowing him to have
[1:30:59] the preeminence in our life and the due
[1:31:01] respect and the honor and the first
[1:31:03] place that he deserves?
[1:31:07] And that's my prayer just tonight in my
[1:31:09] own life is that I would recognize the
[1:31:11] times that I go about things out of my
[1:31:13] own ability, out of my own human
[1:31:16] ability, and I'm not allowing Christ to
[1:31:19] have the preeminence. Even if it's just
[1:31:21] in the doing it as unto the
[1:31:24] Lord and making sure that in my heart at
[1:31:27] the relationship level, it's Christ
[1:31:29] that's having the preeminence in all
[1:31:32] things. and that as a as a as a body if
[1:31:35] we want to be knit together and we want
[1:31:37] to be
[1:31:39] closer I think this is the musicians
[1:31:41] would
[1:31:42] come brother Brandham tells the story
[1:31:45] and be certain of God he says in one
[1:31:49] night I place it like this I was coming
[1:31:52] home from meetings and they had waited
[1:31:55] up a long time to see me and they got
[1:31:58] sleepy and had to go to bed I'd come in
[1:32:01] weary and tired tired and worn and I
[1:32:04] laid down to sleep sometime after
[1:32:06] midnight and a long before daylight I
[1:32:09] couldn't sleep and I got up early to
[1:32:11] keep waking the wife up went out to the
[1:32:14] parlor and sat down in a chair and as I
[1:32:17] was sitting thinking of the meetings and
[1:32:19] praying for the different ones who had
[1:32:21] asked me request I heard a scramble in
[1:32:26] the children's bedroom here come the
[1:32:28] door bursting open and here come Rebecca
[1:32:30] just as hard as she could go and she
[1:32:33] jumped up a straddled my knee and her
[1:32:36] long legs reached down to the floor. She
[1:32:39] threw her arms around me and began to
[1:32:41] hug me. Then I heard something fallen,
[1:32:44] stumbling over the rugs. Sarah was
[1:32:46] behind her and she was wearing Rebecca's
[1:32:48] handme-down pajamas with the feet much
[1:32:52] too long and she couldn't stand up good
[1:32:54] with all them on and she was stumbling.
[1:32:57] And when Recca got seated real good, her
[1:33:00] long legs reaching down the floor, I
[1:33:01] thought, well, this is for some cause.
[1:33:04] And Rebecca reminded me of the church
[1:33:07] that's all settled, knows all its
[1:33:09] doctrine, been at it for a long time,
[1:33:12] well seated. She turned around to her
[1:33:14] little sister Sarah. And Sarah was at
[1:33:16] the door, the end of the hall, and she
[1:33:18] said, "Sarah, I want to tell you
[1:33:20] something." She threw both arms around
[1:33:23] me and said, "I've got all of daddy and
[1:33:26] there's none left for you." And little
[1:33:28] Sarah, like the minority church, her
[1:33:31] little lips drooping down, her little
[1:33:34] brown eyes begin to water because that
[1:33:37] Becky had all of daddy and she loved
[1:33:40] daddy, too. So I stuck out my other leg
[1:33:43] to her and
[1:33:45] motion my finger. her little eyes
[1:33:48] brightened up and she come with them
[1:33:50] little pajamas, feet flying, jumping
[1:33:52] right to straddle my leg and she like
[1:33:54] the m minority church. She wasn't so
[1:33:56] settled down with them great
[1:33:58] denominations behind her and she was
[1:34:00] kind of toddle tottery. She was wobbling
[1:34:04] and I was afraid she was going to fall.
[1:34:07] So I took both my arms and put them
[1:34:09] around her and hugged her up to my
[1:34:10] bosom. She snuggled down to me for a few
[1:34:13] minutes. Then she turned those little
[1:34:15] bride eyes up to her sister Rebecca and
[1:34:17] said, "Rebecca, my sister, I want to
[1:34:20] tell you something." She said, "It's the
[1:34:22] truth that you got all of daddy, but I
[1:34:25] want you to know that daddy gots all of
[1:34:27] me." And that's the way I want it. I
[1:34:30] want to know that the grammar, all the
[1:34:32] Greek, and all the Hebrew, but all that
[1:34:34] to know that Christ has got all of me.
[1:34:37] And I want to be so completely
[1:34:39] insufficient till he can fill his arms
[1:34:41] around me. Uh, isn't that the truth,
[1:34:45] saints?
[1:34:47] It's in our inability that he can have
[1:34:49] all of us and we could feel his arms
[1:34:52] around us and we could be reminded it's
[1:34:54] not us that's holding us, it's him. And
[1:34:57] when we try to do things
[1:35:01] ourselves, it's just us putting a
[1:35:03] confidence in the wrong
[1:35:05] place. He still has the place of
[1:35:07] preeminence. If we look, we can see him.
[1:35:10] His arms are still around us. He's still
[1:35:12] holding us. But the only time we're
[1:35:14] shaken is because we've taken our eyes
[1:35:15] off of who's really holding us. We can't
[1:35:18] hold ourselves. We have no ability to
[1:35:20] keep ourselves. If it's not for the
[1:35:22] grace of God in our lives, we're lost.
[1:35:26] But we can have a confidence that he
[1:35:28] who's begun the work in us will complete
[1:35:30] it.
[1:35:31] And in order for him to have a way to
[1:35:35] manifest himself to those around you,
[1:35:37] you have to die that Christ can live.
[1:35:41] You have to be able to lay lay down your
[1:35:42] own thinking, your own understanding.
[1:35:45] Allow him to have a preeminence in your
[1:35:47] life in the first
[1:35:49] place to quicken his word to you that he
[1:35:54] can use your hands to be his hand
[1:35:57] extended. Let's just stand together. We
[1:35:59] have a a water baptism tonight. We're
[1:36:02] thankful for the work of God to call in
[1:36:04] someone's life and to reveal to them the
[1:36:07] formula. Repent.
[1:36:10] Turn from your ways.
[1:36:12] Recognize there's a life worth living
[1:36:15] for. We don't want to live the life of
[1:36:17] this flesh or after this flesh, but we
[1:36:19] want the life of Christ in us. And we're
[1:36:20] willing to renounce it, this flesh, that
[1:36:23] the life of Christ can live and be
[1:36:26] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:28] Christ that you shall receive the gift
[1:36:29] of the Holy Ghost. And as he's done that
[1:36:32] work, we're thankful tonight to have
[1:36:34] that pull open to fulfill the
[1:36:37] commission to go into all the world,
[1:36:40] preach the gospel, and to
[1:36:41] baptize. Let's just go before him in
[1:36:44] prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, we
[1:36:46] thank you for your word and we we're
[1:36:49] thankful, Father, that you desire to
[1:36:50] have a place of preeminence in our life
[1:36:52] that you want first place, Lord. Lord,
[1:36:55] there's a position to give you and that
[1:36:57] you'll take all of it, Father. And so
[1:37:00] tonight we say, oh God, if there's any
[1:37:01] place we haven't given you, first place,
[1:37:04] Lord, that we can do all things as unto
[1:37:06] you and that we can give you all things
[1:37:08] for by you all things are made. There's
[1:37:11] not anything that isn't yours, Father,
[1:37:14] belongs to you or that you're not worthy
[1:37:15] of. So Father, we give it to you, Lord.
[1:37:19] Even the things pertaining to the
[1:37:21] kingdom of heaven that we in ourselves
[1:37:23] would try to accomplish, we give that to
[1:37:25] you also, Father. Lord, that there would
[1:37:28] be no glory of man or man's
[1:37:30] accomplishment. That it would all be to
[1:37:31] you and to your
[1:37:33] glory. Father, we're thankful, Lord,
[1:37:35] that it's a love affair, Lord, that it's
[1:37:38] you. It's our husband. It's Christ. It's
[1:37:41] the one who has our best interest at
[1:37:43] mind. That you could be a father to the
[1:37:45] fatherless. Lord, you're the one who
[1:37:48] knows what we have need of before we
[1:37:50] ask. Lord, it's in an abandonment to
[1:37:53] self. It's a it's in a it's in a trust
[1:37:55] to you that we can truly lay our lives
[1:37:58] down and say, "Oh, God, have all of me.
[1:38:01] Not my will, Father, but thine be done.
[1:38:04] Lord, change my mind to be your mind.
[1:38:07] Lord, I don't want to preserve my
[1:38:09] thoughts. I don't want to preserve my
[1:38:10] well-being. I don't want to preserve any
[1:38:12] of me. Oh God, I want Christ in me.
[1:38:16] Lord, I'm so tired of this humanity. Oh
[1:38:18] God, I want the heavenly declared. I'm
[1:38:21] thankful that we could pray on earth as
[1:38:23] it is in heaven. Lord, I have a heavenly
[1:38:25] image. I have a heavenly uh
[1:38:29] representation, Lord, and I want it
[1:38:31] manifested here. I'm tired of my
[1:38:34] failures. I'm tired of my faults. Oh
[1:38:36] God, I have a promise of manifesting
[1:38:39] perfection. You said, "Be ye perfect."
[1:38:42] Lord, I want perfection on display.
[1:38:46] Not of man, not of man's ability,
[1:38:48] Father, of what you've done in us. Lord,
[1:38:50] I commit each one here as we'd raise our
[1:38:52] hands to you and surrender, Father,
[1:38:55] asking you to consume us by your spirit
[1:38:57] that your word would divide out the very
[1:38:59] things that are not of you that you
[1:39:01] would be
[1:39:02] glorified. For we commit it to you in
[1:39:04] the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:39:06] pray.
[1:39:09] Amen. Let's sing He is Lord together as
[1:39:12] we turn the service over.
[1:39:15] He is
[1:39:18] Lord. He's risen from the
[1:39:22] dead. He has
[1:39:26] risen from the
[1:39:29] dead and he is
[1:39:34] Lord. Hallelujah. Every
[1:39:37] knee and
[1:39:39] every
[1:39:41] knee
[1:39:43] shall
[1:39:45] bow and
[1:39:47] every
[1:39:49] tongue come.
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:58] Just met. Think about it, church. Let
[1:40:02] him be Lord of all. Sing it one more
[1:40:04] time. He is Lord. Proclaim it. He's my
[1:40:06] Lord. He's my Lord. Oh, He's my Lord.
[1:40:13] Lord, you're my Lord of
[1:40:15] all. He's my
[1:40:17] Lord. You reckon yourself dead and him
[1:40:21] risen in your life. He's risen.
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:39] Oh, and
[1:40:41] every
[1:40:43] knee
[1:40:45] shall bow. Oh, at
[1:40:49] every
[1:40:51] time
[1:40:56] confess and
[1:41:01] Jesus
[1:41:03] Christ
[1:41:04] he just sing it once more. He's my Lord.
[1:41:08] Is he your Lord tonight?
[1:41:12] Oh my
[1:41:17] lord.
[1:41:20] Oh my lord. Just worship him tonight.
[1:41:26] Oh,
[1:41:27] he has
[1:41:30] risen from the
[1:41:33] dead and is
[1:41:43] my
[1:41:45] knee
[1:41:49] shall every
[1:41:55] God
[1:41:57] has
[1:41:59] oh
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:03] Jesus
[1:42:05] Christ
[1:42:08] is
[1:42:13] hallelu the father long love for us.
[1:42:19] of us beyond all
[1:42:23] measure that he should give his only son
[1:42:29] oh to me for at his
[1:42:34] treasure our
[1:42:37] great seeing
[1:42:40] cross the father turn his face
[1:42:45] away as
[1:42:48] Father, the chosen one. Oh, bring many
[1:42:53] sons to
[1:42:57] glory. Oh, and behold the man upon the
[1:43:04] cross. My sins upon his
[1:43:09] shoulders. A shame. I hear the mocker's
[1:43:15] voice call out. I'm under
[1:43:19] scoffer. Oh, it was my sin I held in
[1:43:25] pain until it was
[1:43:31] accomplished. His thy Christ has brought
[1:43:35] me.
[1:43:36] Oh, I know that it is
[1:43:41] fing a greater God that God
[1:43:47] despair to come where I
[1:43:52] hel through tears as he is our
[1:43:57] strength as he declares me. Hallelujah.
[1:44:04] How great the love that song
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:10] behind his
[1:44:13] mercy. His blood is cleansed by every
[1:44:18] part. Oh, and claims me as his virgin.
[1:44:25] I will I will
[1:44:29] stand for your king. Oh God by your
[1:44:33] will.
[1:44:35] Oh my
[1:44:37] go Jesus
[1:44:40] Christ his death and resurrection.
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] Oh, why should I gain my
[1:44:51] dream? I cannot give an
[1:44:56] answer. But this I know with all my
[1:45:01] heart. His
[1:45:03] wounds
[1:45:06] by. Oh, and I will not boast.
[1:45:12] Oh, no gifts, no waste
[1:45:18] of I will boast in Jesus Christ for his
[1:45:24] death and
[1:45:28] resurrection. Why should I give his
[1:45:33] people? I can't give an
[1:45:39] answer. For this I know with all my
[1:45:44] fault his wounds and my
[1:45:50] hallelujah.
[1:45:52] It's him. It's because of him. We don't
[1:45:56] glory in ourselves. We're glorying him.
[1:45:59] I love that. If we could die to our own
[1:46:01] self and just let let him have the
[1:46:04] preeminence. Lord, it's not I have no
[1:46:06] ounce of power, no ounce of energy, but
[1:46:09] it's all you. It's all because of you.
[1:46:13] That's where we rest in. It's it's it's
[1:46:16] in our dying that we find our strength.
[1:46:19] It's not in us exerting and commitment
[1:46:22] and what we you can make all the
[1:46:24] commitment you want, it won't work. But
[1:46:26] if you take his word and you die and you
[1:46:28] say it's because you did this, that's
[1:46:31] why we live. We live because he died for
[1:46:34] us. Amen. Amen. Brother Ben, if you
[1:46:38] could just come and the Smith says those
[1:46:40] that wants to go, we'll go. I know
[1:46:42] there's a baptism waiting and and we'll
[1:46:44] just get ready for the baptism.
[1:46:50] Amen. Let's bow our hearts.
[1:46:53] Gracious heavenly
[1:46:56] father, everlasting father.
[1:47:00] Lord, the one that knoweth all things,
[1:47:04] Lord, you knew today what you'd be
[1:47:06] speaking to us,
[1:47:08] Father. You knew this is what we had
[1:47:10] need of.
[1:47:12] Father, Lord, I can attest and say you
[1:47:14] spoke to me, Lord
[1:47:16] Jesus. How we allow so many things in
[1:47:19] life remove you from your first
[1:47:20] position, Lord. how we get carried away
[1:47:23] with the different things of life, the
[1:47:26] different needs that may come about and
[1:47:28] forget to take care of the main thing,
[1:47:30] Lord, which is you, Lord Jesus. If we
[1:47:34] kept you at your place where you belong
[1:47:36] in the first place, Father, you'd take
[1:47:38] care of everything that comes up, Lord
[1:47:40] Jesus. But how the devil will put in the
[1:47:43] mind of a son and daughter of God that
[1:47:45] you've got to figure it out and remove
[1:47:48] him from the first place to figure it
[1:47:49] out. But that's not the case, Lord. My
[1:47:52] Bible says the righteous shall not bake
[1:47:54] bread. My Bible says that you answer to
[1:47:57] all the needs of your children. Father,
[1:47:59] my Bible taught me that when Daniel was
[1:48:01] praying, before he finished his prayer,
[1:48:03] an answer was on his way. Lord, that's
[1:48:06] the kind of God we serve. Father, you
[1:48:08] told us to seek first the kingdom of God
[1:48:10] and your righteousness, and everything
[1:48:12] else will be added unto us. Father,
[1:48:14] right now, Lord, for myself, I recommmit
[1:48:17] and dedicate my life to you, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:20] And anyone in this building, Lord, that
[1:48:22] felt as if they've put you in a
[1:48:24] different place than where you belong,
[1:48:25] Lord Jesus. If they make it known by the
[1:48:28] uplifting of their hands to you, Lord,
[1:48:30] you see it, Father. You see what they're
[1:48:32] asking for, Lord Jesus. The simplicity
[1:48:35] of desiring and wanting you to be in the
[1:48:37] first place. You can move on that, Lord
[1:48:39] Jesus. Your prophet taught us that the
[1:48:41] least desire to serve you was greater
[1:48:44] than any desire to serve this world.
[1:48:45] Lord Jesus, we want to just put our
[1:48:48] hearts towards you, Lord. Our life's
[1:48:50] ambition, goals, and plans, everything
[1:48:52] towards you, Lord Jesus. True success is
[1:48:54] walking faithfully with Jesus. For
[1:48:56] there's answers for all things, Lord.
[1:48:59] The mountains you move, Lord. When we
[1:49:01] can come with the right motive and
[1:49:03] objective, when we can come right behind
[1:49:05] your word, Lord Jesus, only asking what
[1:49:07] your word says. Father, we have access
[1:49:09] to anything we desire. Lord Jesus, teach
[1:49:12] us to speak the heavenly language. Lord
[1:49:15] Jesus, teach us to dwell, Lord Jesus, in
[1:49:18] that heavenly world. Lord, your prophet
[1:49:20] said we are in heavenly places in Christ
[1:49:22] Jesus. Now, Father, but how can we be in
[1:49:24] such a place if we don't feed on your
[1:49:26] word? If we don't dwell and live in your
[1:49:29] word, Lord, there's freedom by the
[1:49:31] preaching of the word. There's
[1:49:32] deliverance by the preaching of the
[1:49:34] word. There's healing by the preaching
[1:49:36] of the word. There's an answer by the
[1:49:38] preaching of the word. There's no
[1:49:40] problem too great. Your word can't
[1:49:41] answer, Lord Jesus. We're the problem.
[1:49:45] We think that there's a limit to your
[1:49:47] power, Lord Jesus. When you never
[1:49:49] preached of a limitless God, Lord Jesus,
[1:49:51] but you preached us that to him all
[1:49:54] things are possible, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[1:49:57] we thank you for our brother David and
[1:49:59] his pouring of love that he gave to us.
[1:50:03] Lord Jesus, I pray you restore to him
[1:50:05] tenfold what he's poured out, Lord
[1:50:07] Jesus. Continue to give him more
[1:50:09] revelation, Lord Jesus, that he might
[1:50:12] continue to pour out, Father, and teach
[1:50:14] us to pull on the gift, Lord, to absorb,
[1:50:17] Lord. We're not here to hear a man, Lord
[1:50:19] Jesus, but we're to hear from you,
[1:50:21] Father. If we can't amen when you speak
[1:50:24] to us, Lord Jesus, is it falling on deaf
[1:50:27] ears, Lord Jesus. No, Father, shake us,
[1:50:30] Lord Jesus. To be awoken when we hear
[1:50:33] the word to claim it as ours, Lord
[1:50:35] Jesus. We leave the remainder of the
[1:50:37] time into your hands, the baptism that's
[1:50:39] about to take place, Lord. And for those
[1:50:41] that have to go back, Lord Jesus, and go
[1:50:43] back home. Father, I pray that this
[1:50:45] night may be different from every other
[1:50:47] night, Lord Jesus. that no one leaves
[1:50:49] this place just going back, Lord, but
[1:50:51] they may be going home with the fire in
[1:50:54] their heart, Lord Jesus, to remove all
[1:50:57] the things that we've misplaced and
[1:50:59] replace you where you belong, Lord
[1:51:01] Jesus. Realign all things in our lives
[1:51:03] the way that you asked for it to be,
[1:51:05] Lord Jesus. There's only victory in one
[1:51:08] thing, and that's your word, Lord Jesus.
[1:51:11] We believe it and we trust you, Lord,
[1:51:12] and we love you. We ask these things in
[1:51:14] the precious mighty name of the Lord
[1:51:16] Jesus Christ. Be the driver of every
[1:51:18] vehicle. Depart from every person from
[1:51:21] incidents and accidents, Lord Jesus. Let
[1:51:23] them get home safely, Father. And let us
[1:51:26] come back with hearts ablaze on Sunday
[1:51:28] to hear from you once more, Lord Jesus.
[1:51:31] We thank you and we love you. We ask
[1:51:32] these things in the precious and
[1:51:34] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:51:37] Amen.
[1:51:39] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Those that
[1:51:42] wants to go can go. You may have your
[1:51:44] seats. I'm
[1:51:47] forgiven because you were
[1:51:52] forsaken. I'm
[1:51:56] accepted. You were
[1:51:59] [Music]
[1:52:01] condemned. I'm alive and well. Your
[1:52:05] spirit lives within me
[1:52:09] because you died and rose again.
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:19] Amazing
[1:52:21] love. How can it
[1:52:26] be that you, my king, would act for
[1:52:35] me. Amazing
[1:52:38] love I know be
[1:52:43] true. And it's my joy to honor
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:49] you with all I
[1:52:53] do. I honor you.
[1:53:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:53:32] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:53:35] Why don't we stand and sing that? Amen.
[1:53:38] Hey, there's nothing sing like like like
[1:53:40] seeing someone getting baptized. Amen.
[1:53:43] It brings all the joy that is in the
[1:53:45] world. Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:53:48] the
[1:53:49] Lord. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:53:53] Lord.
