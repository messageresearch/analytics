[32:48] in its presence amen hallelujah
[32:52] i'm sure we can all agree that there's
[32:55] there's nothing like the presence amen
[32:58] i kind of handicapped myself a little
[33:00] bit i guess by not
[33:02] uh using the uh mic i'm used to so i'll
[33:05] hold this
[33:07] instead but if we all want to turn in
[33:09] our bibles to
[33:10] proverbs
[33:18] i don't know if the pulpit mike will be
[33:20] sufficient brothers or do i need to hold
[33:22] this one
[33:28] wonderful
[33:32] be reading out of proverbs 22.
[33:38] man it's just good to be in the house of
[33:41] the lord especially on a communion
[33:43] service
[33:45] now let's just uh read proverbs 22 verse
[33:48] 4 but maybe we'll just read
[33:53] starting with verse one a good name is
[33:55] rather to be chosen
[33:57] than great riches and loving favor
[33:59] rather than silver and gold
[34:02] the rich and the poor meet together
[34:05] the lord is the maker of them all
[34:08] prudent man foreseeth the evil
[34:09] and hideth himself but the simple pass
[34:11] on
[34:12] and are punished by humility and
[34:16] fear of the lord our riches and honor
[34:20] and life heavenly father we just
[34:22] approach you as we've read your word
[34:24] lord
[34:25] just surrendering ourselves to you that
[34:27] you might come and have the preeminence
[34:29] and the service
[34:30] or that you'd speak to your people pray
[34:33] that you would impart revelation lord
[34:35] and
[34:35] may you just anoint the speaker and the
[34:37] hearer in jesus christ's name we pray
[34:39] amen amen you may be seated
[34:45] i mean just in in reading uh proverbs
[34:48] 22 verse 4 says by humility and fear
[34:52] of the lord our riches and honor and
[34:54] life and
[34:55] you know especially in the day and age
[34:58] we're living in if you were to ask
[34:59] somebody how do i obtain rich's honor in
[35:03] life i
[35:03] imagine this probably wouldn't be in a
[35:07] thousand answers
[35:09] how can i how can i obtain riches and
[35:11] how can i obtain
[35:12] honor and how can i obtain life well for
[35:15] the believer
[35:16] having the word of god we know that the
[35:18] way we obtain rich's honor in life
[35:21] is by humility and fear of the lord
[35:25] the prophet says and how can i overcome
[35:27] he says
[35:28] i've had the privilege of getting
[35:30] meeting some great men
[35:32] and it's these guys that got a change of
[35:35] clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to
[35:37] rattle
[35:38] that's the guy that thinks he's
[35:39] something when he's nothing
[35:42] but i stood by great men i mean
[35:45] great men with ragged sleeve cuffs they
[35:48] make you think
[35:49] you're the great person see greatness
[35:52] is humility don't forget that
[35:55] church greatness is expressed in
[35:58] humility
[35:59] not how fine you can be i don't mean
[36:02] dirty now i mean humble in spirit see i
[36:05] don't mean just
[36:06] get out and don't ever wash and clean up
[36:08] that you should do
[36:09] you know that see but i'm talking about
[36:11] humility
[36:12] genuine humility not something is put on
[36:17] something that is that's a real humility
[36:21] jesus told us how to do it he overcome
[36:24] means overcome means to stand the test
[36:27] that's right like all the old saints did
[36:30] like jesus did amidst of all his enemies
[36:34] he stood the test
[36:35] everything he was tested against he
[36:38] stood it
[36:39] in the very face of sickness and him
[36:41] being the messiah he healed them
[36:43] in the face of death he brought it back
[36:45] to life in the face
[36:47] of calvary his own death he defeated it
[36:50] by surrendering himself why by the word
[36:54] you destroy this temple and i'll raise
[36:56] it up in three days
[36:58] the word said so see and in the presence
[37:01] of death
[37:02] he defeated it he overcome death in the
[37:04] presence of hell he defeated hell and
[37:06] overcome hell yes
[37:08] in the presence of the grave he overcame
[37:11] the grave why
[37:13] all by the word and humility
[37:16] oh my there's the real man there's the
[37:19] one
[37:20] to make your example see he defeated
[37:22] everything
[37:23] overcome it and philippians 2 8
[37:26] says and being found in the fashion as a
[37:29] man
[37:30] he humbled himself and became obedient
[37:34] unto death
[37:34] even the death of the cross wherefore
[37:37] god also
[37:38] hath highly exalted him and given him a
[37:41] name which is above
[37:42] every name that at the name of jesus
[37:45] every name should bow
[37:46] of things in heaven and things in earth
[37:49] and things under the earth all by what
[37:54] all by the word and humility
[37:57] there's the real man that that's the one
[38:00] to make our example and just in
[38:04] something that's on my heart in in
[38:06] reading this you know
[38:07] i believe that it's it's every uh
[38:10] believer's desire that we want to climb
[38:12] into higher heights
[38:14] and jesus christ and and when we read
[38:16] the message and we read the word of god
[38:18] there's
[38:19] there's a great hunger for us to
[38:21] manifest the things that have been
[38:22] spoken
[38:23] of the bride and and there's a longing
[38:26] as our pastors been speaking on the
[38:27] attributes of god and
[38:29] and the stature of a perfect man oh
[38:31] something in us just longs
[38:33] that we would manifest all of these
[38:35] attributes just
[38:36] according to what would please the lord
[38:39] you know and jesus said for whosoever
[38:42] exalteth himself
[38:43] he shall be a base but he that humbleth
[38:46] himself
[38:47] shall be exalted and just in and maybe
[38:50] in reading these things i i'd like to
[38:53] just speak to you
[38:54] this night maybe just not taking much
[38:58] time but i thought maybe this would go
[39:00] well
[39:01] with the communion service but i want to
[39:04] speak for a little bit about the death
[39:06] of pride and the victory of humility
[39:10] may we just uh read a few quotes and
[39:12] scriptures and and
[39:14] if if maybe we can take this with us uh
[39:17] into the week and into our lives and
[39:19] reflect on these things and and
[39:21] and really uh uh have a a
[39:24] something start to transform in our
[39:27] lives that would bring this type of
[39:29] humility
[39:30] into manifestation because the prophet
[39:33] now look when the prophet speaks
[39:35] something
[39:35] understand that this was more than a
[39:38] prophet
[39:40] this was god speaking and so when he
[39:43] says
[39:43] that he overcame by the word and
[39:46] humility
[39:47] that that's not a catchy phrase but
[39:49] there's a truth and a revelation
[39:51] that we can catch in it that will give
[39:53] us the victory
[39:56] he says so just in in reading that word
[39:59] humility it's it's a freedom from pride
[40:02] or arrogance that's maybe something out
[40:05] of the webster dictionary uh humility is
[40:08] freedom
[40:09] from pride or arrogance now we just
[40:12] we just think of the the humility
[40:15] of being an attribute of god my when
[40:18] when he could have come
[40:19] any way he wanted to the earth but he
[40:21] chose a manger
[40:23] he chose the most simple uh uh
[40:26] a way in humility that he could come so
[40:29] vulnerable
[40:30] uh in a babe in a way that all men have
[40:32] come
[40:33] uh not making himself a a greater coming
[40:36] in some
[40:37] uh a form that that it's unobtainable
[40:40] but he came in and liked fashion
[40:42] as we and he made himself humble and
[40:44] even humbled himself
[40:46] even unto death brother branham said he
[40:49] dwells in humility in your heart
[40:52] he comes in humility in the form of
[40:54] meekness
[40:55] and gentleness and i like this uh
[40:59] uh quote here they titled the sermon
[41:01] humble thyself and it's just a short
[41:03] excerpt where
[41:05] brother branham i believe he speaks
[41:07] before brother
[41:08] level and out of humble thyself
[41:12] in 63 it says now we look at this watch
[41:16] to find out what time it is unless
[41:20] that every instrument in that watch is
[41:23] coordinating one with the other
[41:27] will never know the correct time is that
[41:29] right
[41:30] he's speaking of an old-fashioned wrist
[41:32] watch
[41:34] some some folks now maybe have never
[41:36] even seen an old-fashioned wristwatch
[41:38] but
[41:38] all the the design in there and all the
[41:40] springs and the little gadgets and
[41:42] everything
[41:42] if one of them gets out of balance or or
[41:44] the spraying ain't just right it'll
[41:46] never tell the correct time but
[41:48] you know when it when it's when a a
[41:50] master watchman has crafted a watch and
[41:52] put it together oh it's just right on
[41:54] time but
[41:55] but if something gets out of cater it
[41:58] won't work quite right
[41:59] and the prophet says and that takes all
[42:02] of us
[42:03] all together if we want to see the third
[42:07] pool
[42:08] really do something for god
[42:11] coordination with every one of us
[42:14] together to humble ourselves before god
[42:18] and confess our wrongs and pray
[42:22] and believe god for these things
[42:25] all of us together look we're all part
[42:29] of
[42:29] a body right we've all been birthed into
[42:33] the body of jesus christ and
[42:35] and we're all members in particular we
[42:38] all have a specific
[42:40] job to do that we've been predestinated
[42:42] to uh the eye can't look at the foot and
[42:44] say i don't have no need of you
[42:47] and the prophet is laying this out
[42:49] saying oh it takes all of us
[42:52] together so we all have a personal
[42:55] responsibility
[42:56] to play he says if we want
[43:00] the third pool really do something how
[43:03] many how many wants to see the third
[43:05] pool in action
[43:07] how many is longing for the things that
[43:09] he spoke of i believe it's a look away
[43:11] to jesus
[43:12] and and december uh 29th in 1963 he goes
[43:16] i now know what the third pool is and
[43:18] what it does we we know what the third
[43:20] pool has done it's bringing man
[43:22] back into his rightful position once
[43:25] again everything that adam had lost
[43:27] that we might come into dominion over
[43:29] the earth once again
[43:30] and we saw a first one coming to that
[43:32] maturity
[43:33] with the power of the spoken word and
[43:36] able to speak to the storms
[43:38] able to call life back all of those
[43:40] things that i believe
[43:41] are the bride of something in her heart
[43:44] is longing and knowing
[43:46] that all of these things that we've
[43:48] heard and we've seen demonstrated
[43:50] it's something that belongs to us
[43:53] and how are these things going to come
[43:56] into manifestation
[43:57] uh uh god is speaking to our heart and
[44:00] he's saying if you want to see
[44:02] the third pool really do something for
[44:04] god
[44:05] oh it's going to take all of us together
[44:08] to humble ourselves oh my i thought it
[44:12] would be
[44:13] been some big demonstration i thought
[44:16] we'd have to
[44:17] uh maybe get into some big rally and
[44:19] some
[44:20] big special special meeting and get all
[44:22] uh
[44:23] worked up into a frenzy in mind just get
[44:25] things all
[44:26] swelling around but always says to
[44:29] humble ourselves before god
[44:32] and confess our wrongs and pray
[44:36] and believe god for these things you
[44:39] know as i read that just to jump out of
[44:41] this
[44:42] uh quote for a moment just thinking
[44:46] about the body and all of us together
[44:49] you know it's so easy uh uh to be
[44:51] carnally minded about the body of god
[44:54] and
[44:54] and how we esteem one another and you
[44:56] you hold one another and
[44:58] and things become common
[45:01] but you know paul said in first
[45:03] corinthians 12
[45:04] 23 he said in those members of the body
[45:08] which we think to be less honorable
[45:12] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[45:17] and our uncomely parts have more
[45:20] abundant commonness for our comely parts
[45:24] have no need and when you look into
[45:27] uh uh uh the definition or what um
[45:29] comely means it
[45:30] it means a deformed or or the part
[45:34] that has a need and so i love how god in
[45:37] his
[45:37] his mind would come and say for our
[45:39] calmly parts have no need but god hath
[45:41] tempered the body together having given
[45:44] more
[45:45] abundant honor to the part which lacked
[45:49] so am i how many times does the devil
[45:51] try to come and beat you down and make
[45:53] you feel like you're so needy
[45:55] well the word comes right and says hey
[45:56] i'm i'm bestowing more abundant honor
[45:59] upon you
[46:00] i love how the mind of god speaks oh if
[46:02] you think if you think you're the
[46:04] greatest where you're the least and if
[46:06] you're the least well you're the
[46:07] greatest
[46:08] uh why because we're all a body there's
[46:11] no big eyes there's no
[46:12] uh little use we all need one another to
[46:15] go in a rapture together
[46:17] look we're coming into rapturing
[46:19] condition
[46:20] and what did the prophet say when that
[46:22] last one comes in
[46:24] and that last one might be sitting right
[46:26] here in this church they're coming in is
[46:28] it coming into the church building
[46:31] what is the coming into coming in is
[46:33] catching the revelation
[46:35] of who you are in jesus christ and when
[46:37] that happens
[46:38] when the bride recognizes who she is
[46:41] that she
[46:42] can do the greater works and she
[46:44] recognizes those two spirits
[46:46] working in the framework of the church
[46:48] oh she'll stand
[46:49] like a mighty invincible army all but it
[46:52] takes all of us together
[46:56] oh and how does that happen my
[47:00] we gotta humble ourselves we gotta
[47:03] confess our faults and our wrongs
[47:06] together we need to pray oh i i think
[47:10] this is a wonderful word as we would
[47:11] approach communion
[47:14] maybe something in our heart would just
[47:16] even
[47:17] uh allow communion to to have a greater
[47:20] meaning to us
[47:23] it's not a ritual but it's an ordinance
[47:26] that god has given to us
[47:29] oh and it's an honor to know the truth
[47:32] and it's an
[47:33] honor to take communion it's an honor
[47:36] to wash the feet of the brothers and
[47:38] sisters
[47:41] why because our lord and our savior he
[47:44] humbled himself
[47:46] made himself a what would be called a
[47:48] foot wash flunky
[47:51] but but don't as we move along don't
[47:54] mistake
[47:55] humility for a a maybe
[47:58] a a negative weakness or a humility
[48:02] that's
[48:03] vulnerable to the devil but i'm talking
[48:06] about a godly
[48:07] humility something that is a very
[48:10] attribute and part of the mind of god
[48:16] for our crumbly parents have no need but
[48:19] god have tempered the body together
[48:21] having given more abundant honor to the
[48:23] part which lacked
[48:25] that there should be no schisms in the
[48:27] body
[48:29] but that the members should have the
[48:31] same care
[48:33] one for another the same care
[48:36] one for another do we all have that type
[48:39] of love
[48:40] do we have the same care for one another
[48:45] well maybe i could be a little honest to
[48:48] maybe help this
[48:49] uh uh be a little bit more clear about
[48:51] how that how
[48:52] how god dealt with my heart one time but
[48:55] you know
[48:56] a brother uh you know was in need of
[48:59] something
[49:00] i can't remember coming into town and
[49:03] and was asking
[49:04] uh maybe for a ride or for something and
[49:07] and i was in a place to where
[49:09] it was going to be a little bit more
[49:10] burden to me to do it
[49:13] and i started to maybe think of other
[49:14] options but the lord spoke to my heart
[49:16] and goes well if that was brother
[49:18] so-and-so
[49:19] you know what i said yes lord
[49:22] i drop everything i'm doing i said god
[49:26] forgive me
[49:28] i realize i let pride i realized lord i
[49:33] there's something in me that needs to
[49:34] change when
[49:36] when i would treat one of your elected
[49:40] and chosen
[49:41] look i'm bearing my heart to you let's
[49:44] be honest with ourselves tonight
[49:47] look there's certain ones of the body
[49:50] that when they come asking
[49:51] uh we're more willing oh why because
[49:55] we're bestowing
[49:56] our own abundant honor upon them when
[49:59] the word says
[50:00] but that members should have the same
[50:02] care for one another
[50:04] oh this is the love that capstone love
[50:07] that we got to come into where it's a
[50:09] godly love
[50:10] that we we no matter who the brother and
[50:12] sister is oh there's such a love of god
[50:14] that
[50:15] there's no preferences and and there's
[50:17] no esteeming
[50:18] a greater honor to this man than that
[50:20] man but we'll love him just the same as
[50:23] christ
[50:23] loved every single one of us that's the
[50:27] love that's the agape love
[50:29] that's moving into the bride to bring us
[50:31] into higher heights
[50:34] oh but it takes a death to pride and it
[50:37] takes a victory of humility
[50:40] and i pray that what god has laid on my
[50:42] heart
[50:43] if something that could could be
[50:45] conveyed and
[50:46] and you could catch the revelation of
[50:48] the true victory of humility
[50:51] because in that victory of humility all
[50:53] it's not a burden anymore
[50:58] you know people want power
[51:02] and really they don't know what power is
[51:07] they really don't know what goes with it
[51:10] the way up is down
[51:12] always if you want power
[51:15] see how humble you can get
[51:19] just get away from all your worldly
[51:22] thinking
[51:24] and humble yourself before god
[51:29] and then you've got more power than the
[51:32] man that runs
[51:33] all over the building and makes a big
[51:36] lot of noise see
[51:37] because you have bent over to conquer
[51:39] yourself
[51:41] and commit yourself to christ to humble
[51:44] yourself before him
[51:46] that's real power you show me a church
[51:50] that's humble
[51:51] real humble not an arrogant church
[51:55] just a sweet humble church
[51:58] i'll show you a church that has the
[52:00] favor
[52:01] and power of god that's right that's
[52:04] the thing it takes humility
[52:08] humbling ourselves before god
[52:11] and letting god just work through us
[52:15] don't have to make a lot of noise
[52:19] but you know i find that that's a lot of
[52:22] times what pride was
[52:24] it's a lot of times what the human
[52:27] nature wants is
[52:28] is a little bit of recognition maybe a
[52:31] little
[52:32] bit of of of of hey pat on the back
[52:36] uh good job i i'm proud of you
[52:39] guys i thought about it you know pride
[52:40] wants to be the quarterback
[52:43] pride wants to be the one with the ball
[52:46] uh pride always uh you know uh uh well
[52:48] you know
[52:49] he can do it but i can do it too but
[52:52] the prophet even starts talking about uh
[52:55] uh
[52:56] about being a team and being a body is
[52:58] that it's like a football game
[53:01] he said you know look everybody can't
[53:04] have the ball
[53:05] every everybody can't run with the ball
[53:08] he said the problem is
[53:09] we're all trying to take the ball from
[53:11] one another
[53:13] he says some of us need to block some of
[53:16] us need to get on our knees and pray
[53:18] some of us need to give a word of
[53:19] testimony some of us need to encourage a
[53:22] brother
[53:22] some of us need to reach out to those
[53:24] brothers and sisters that we don't see
[53:26] sitting in the pews oh some of us we got
[53:28] to become team players
[53:32] you know we're trying to build a church
[53:33] here
[53:35] you know and i think my if could you
[53:38] imagine if we all
[53:39] we all wanted to give our two cents
[53:42] it'd be a funny looking church no
[53:45] brother david i think this should be
[53:46] here and i think this should be here and
[53:48] i think it should be this big and i
[53:49] think it should be that
[53:50] that tall and then oh you know what you
[53:52] know what pry does when
[53:54] when when uh let's just use building the
[53:56] church as an example but this just
[53:58] applies to
[53:58] a litany of things in our life but oh
[54:01] when your expertise isn't drawn from
[54:03] or your specific skill set or or your
[54:07] gift that god has given you in the call
[54:09] that he's placed in your life
[54:10] when it's not utilized oh you get
[54:12] offended
[54:15] why because you're equipped and you're
[54:17] able and i've been called for the job
[54:20] lord that's why i'm here
[54:21] and they didn't even they didn't even
[54:23] come to me and asked my advice
[54:27] well i'm sorry you don't got the ball
[54:30] but you can do something
[54:34] who's in charge here
[54:38] god's in charge the holy ghost is in
[54:41] charge
[54:42] and you know what happens when we start
[54:44] questioning the leadership of the holy
[54:45] ghost
[54:47] we become a dathan or korra
[54:50] oh my goodness you know these brothers
[54:53] they're taking too much upon themselves
[54:56] i i think i need to give them a little
[54:58] bit of advice on how they should do
[55:00] things watch out nathan and cora
[55:02] you might be running right into the very
[55:06] will of god that he's orchestrating for
[55:08] the body
[55:10] but maybe maybe we got to humble
[55:13] ourselves
[55:14] maybe we ought to pray maybe we ought to
[55:18] start finding out well lord if i'm not
[55:20] going to be the one carrying the ball
[55:22] how can i properly how can i properly
[55:26] block what's the part that i can play
[55:29] look
[55:30] if we're all fighting amongst ourselves
[55:32] we're not going to score a touchdown
[55:36] we're going to go in a rapture but i
[55:38] want to go in the rapture a whole lot
[55:39] sooner if we're all bickering and
[55:41] fighting and there's schisms in the
[55:42] church
[55:43] and everything's messed up god's god's
[55:45] going to let things get uncomfortable
[55:48] until we all get on our face and seek
[55:50] god and get in one mind in one accord
[55:52] and one unity
[55:54] but all that what does the scripture say
[55:56] paul goes on to say look if one suffers
[55:59] we all suffer but if one rejoice we all
[56:03] rejoice
[56:04] oh isn't that right look when the
[56:06] running back runs in and scores a
[56:07] touchdown
[56:08] everybody's celebrating the blockers are
[56:11] celebrating the wide receivers are
[56:12] celebrating the quarterback
[56:14] oh the coach on the sideline the defense
[56:16] wasn't even on the field and they're
[56:18] celebrating
[56:19] why because we're a body
[56:22] oh oh let's let's get to a place
[56:26] where we're so sold out so surrender to
[56:29] god
[56:30] where there's such a humility in us
[56:34] that when the ball is given to a brother
[56:36] or sister
[56:37] we're we're so happy for him so you know
[56:40] what
[56:41] praise god lord i'm so glad you're using
[56:44] that brother
[56:46] i'm so glad you gave that sister an
[56:48] opportunity
[56:49] well i've been cleaning the church for
[56:51] 20 years and no one ever gave me a
[56:53] dollar for it and now some so i don't
[56:55] know where i'm going now some sister's
[56:56] cleaning it making money
[56:58] and all of us you ought to say you know
[56:59] what praise god he's doing that for that
[57:02] sister
[57:03] i don't know where that came from but
[57:04] but we got to take that
[57:06] uh into every avenue into our life
[57:09] and not let pride or bitterness spring
[57:12] up in us
[57:12] where we start to fight against the body
[57:17] oh if we can have a humility
[57:22] we see people blessed and we see people
[57:25] prosper we see people get things that
[57:28] you want
[57:29] oh if any humility and when i'm talking
[57:33] about true humility
[57:35] it's a true happiness
[57:38] and pleasure to exalt your brother
[57:43] where it actually becomes a joy
[57:47] and something that's a part of you that
[57:50] you
[57:50] like to see them succeed even in your
[57:53] place
[57:55] i just thought about it you know as
[57:57] you're raising your children and
[57:59] and uh for a few years
[58:02] you can outrun them you know and oh you
[58:05] want to race and sure enough you let
[58:07] them win
[58:08] and they're all proud of themselves
[58:09] right well
[58:13] that's because they're your child uh
[58:17] you're you're you're allowing that but
[58:18] oh get a competitive bone in you
[58:21] let it be a brother or something like
[58:22] they believe i'm going to do everything
[58:24] in my power unless i give even and i
[58:25] kill myself
[58:27] but that's that's a love maybe i'm
[58:29] speaking of as just a father
[58:31] mother raising a child that you would
[58:33] just you just want them to experience
[58:35] that joy
[58:36] you'd want him to have that type of fun
[58:38] oh think of how much more in the
[58:39] the agape love of god that if we can let
[58:42] that
[58:43] capstone be settled down upon us
[58:46] with the statue of a perfect man and
[58:48] that type of humility when we could look
[58:50] upon our brothers and sisters and be so
[58:53] happy for them for the work of god that
[58:55] he's doing in their life
[58:59] and start taking care of one another
[59:04] and for the ones that are suffering and
[59:07] for the ones that have burdens
[59:10] you know we we we develop friendships
[59:13] and
[59:15] we maybe have our little circles in the
[59:17] church and
[59:18] the brothers and sisters we fellowship
[59:20] with more often
[59:23] and while summer in prayer
[59:27] and some are in great need
[59:31] seeking god because of the great trial
[59:33] in their life
[59:35] we're a little bit more disconnected and
[59:38] we're in another place and
[59:40] we're more joyous and we're more happy
[59:43] but all if if we could just start coming
[59:45] into a greater unity church
[59:48] start coming into a love and looking
[59:50] upon the needs of one another
[59:59] philippians says
[1:00:05] chapter 2 verse 3 says let nothing be
[1:00:08] done
[1:00:10] through strife or vainglory but in
[1:00:13] lowliness of mind let each esteem
[1:00:16] the other better than themselves
[1:00:20] i'm not talking about now we're not
[1:00:22] talking about a false
[1:00:23] humility one that deceives or one that's
[1:00:26] trying to check the box
[1:00:28] that i'm humble i never forget one time
[1:00:31] my brother uh
[1:00:32] paid me a compliment and i said you know
[1:00:35] i
[1:00:35] that that thank you so much that really
[1:00:38] means a lot coming from you
[1:00:40] and this reply is well i know
[1:00:43] like so does that take away the
[1:00:47] compliment
[1:00:48] so you know it means a lot to me so you
[1:00:50] gave me the compliment because you knew
[1:00:52] it meant a lot to me but
[1:00:53] you really didn't feel that way
[1:00:58] and if i was to give my opinion there
[1:01:00] which
[1:01:01] i won't i could just say this it seems
[1:01:04] there maybe could have been
[1:01:05] a deeper sincerity there could have been
[1:01:08] a greater
[1:01:10] humility
[1:01:13] and that's what we don't want to have is
[1:01:15] a false humility
[1:01:17] a put on where
[1:01:21] the very things that i'm talking about
[1:01:24] you're
[1:01:24] trying to manufacture it
[1:01:27] it'll never work it'll start to breed
[1:01:31] bitterness
[1:01:33] and i was i was thinking about that you
[1:01:35] know where
[1:01:37] we're using football as the example
[1:01:39] where all of a sudden the guy running
[1:01:40] with the ball you just wish he'd fumble
[1:01:43] i need this guy to fumble or trip or
[1:01:45] drop a few catches so i can get in the
[1:01:47] game
[1:01:49] well that might that might sound like
[1:01:51] it's in a church setting
[1:01:52] but we got to take that into our lives
[1:01:55] and into our family and into our
[1:01:56] workplaces
[1:01:58] and have such a humility where we're
[1:02:00] esteeming those
[1:02:01] that we come in contact with and we're
[1:02:03] esteeming our brothers and our sisters
[1:02:06] greater than we are and then when you
[1:02:09] come into that place of
[1:02:10] love and humility there's such an easy
[1:02:13] ability just to to do the the compliment
[1:02:17] and support and the lifting up and the
[1:02:19] praying one for another because there's
[1:02:21] something
[1:02:21] genuine in your heart
[1:02:25] the prophet says and influence the thing
[1:02:27] of it is people
[1:02:30] my brother sister and friends
[1:02:33] is to be conscious of your littleness
[1:02:37] see don't be conscious of how big you
[1:02:39] are
[1:02:40] be conscious in how little you are
[1:02:43] you're small we're all that way
[1:02:47] god can do without us but we can't do
[1:02:49] without him see
[1:02:51] we can't do without him but he can do
[1:02:54] without us
[1:02:55] god is only trying to find one person
[1:02:58] he can get his hands he has always tried
[1:03:02] to do that
[1:03:03] you notice all down through the bible
[1:03:05] when he found in isaiah
[1:03:07] when he found a jeremiah
[1:03:10] then he found a samson you know one day
[1:03:12] but samson gave his strength to god
[1:03:15] but he gave his heart to delilah you've
[1:03:18] got to give your all to god
[1:03:20] your reverence your respect
[1:03:24] your everything that you are just be
[1:03:27] nothing just see how little you are and
[1:03:30] that's what god wants us to do
[1:03:32] and that's real humility that's the way
[1:03:36] these seraphims are
[1:03:37] in his presence you see with their faces
[1:03:40] in reverence
[1:03:41] covered their feet in humility
[1:03:45] now thirdly they could fly they they had
[1:03:48] two wings
[1:03:49] that put them in action god has shown
[1:03:52] his prophet here what kind of servant
[1:03:54] he has prepared humble
[1:03:58] and in action see that's a real servant
[1:04:02] of god
[1:04:04] these who look upon him he was looking
[1:04:06] upon
[1:04:07] he was looking upon hezekiah that got
[1:04:09] lifted up
[1:04:10] and fell by pride but a servant we all
[1:04:13] know the story of hezekiah he was a king
[1:04:15] and
[1:04:16] he he got lifted up by pride and thought
[1:04:18] that he could go in and
[1:04:19] and offer up incense and take over
[1:04:23] the office of the priest he got lifted
[1:04:25] up in his heart
[1:04:27] and god punished him for that but a
[1:04:30] servant
[1:04:31] his servant is before him is reverent
[1:04:34] humble and in action his servants that's
[1:04:37] the way they should be dressed
[1:04:39] dressed in reverence humility and
[1:04:41] constantly about the father's business
[1:04:44] yes sir reverent humble
[1:04:48] and in action lord i want to be reverent
[1:04:53] humble and an action i need a greater
[1:04:56] revelation of what that means
[1:04:59] reverend humble and inaction and if
[1:05:01] you've obtained it
[1:05:02] give me a call let me know how i can do
[1:05:04] better
[1:05:05] i believe that this is a very
[1:05:07] attributing characteristic
[1:05:09] that god is wanting to impart and to the
[1:05:12] bride
[1:05:12] first peter 5 5 says likewise you
[1:05:14] younger
[1:05:16] submit yourselves unto the elder yea all
[1:05:19] of you be
[1:05:19] subject one to another and be close with
[1:05:23] humility for god resist
[1:05:25] resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[1:05:29] to the humble we're speaking about the
[1:05:32] death of pride
[1:05:34] speaking about the victory of humility
[1:05:38] and that's what i was saying i'm not
[1:05:40] talking about some pushover
[1:05:42] i'm not talking about you going into the
[1:05:44] the workplace and
[1:05:46] and and maybe in your family or with
[1:05:48] your boss and where
[1:05:50] they're always running you down and and
[1:05:53] maybe they're always speaking against
[1:05:54] the lord and
[1:05:56] and and you're just i'm just going to
[1:05:58] take the back seat
[1:05:59] i'm just no no we're talking about
[1:06:01] humility with our brothers and sisters
[1:06:03] in christ
[1:06:05] but there comes a time where even in
[1:06:07] that humility
[1:06:09] you can be pressed and i believe it's
[1:06:12] your god-given right
[1:06:13] that you stand up for what you believe
[1:06:16] that reminds me of the story
[1:06:18] of miss weber uh uh she she's an old
[1:06:21] saint that went to uh brother branham's
[1:06:22] church he
[1:06:23] he gives an account of this and digging
[1:06:25] the valley full of ditches i believe
[1:06:27] it's in 1950
[1:06:28] and he talks about ole miss weber and
[1:06:30] the the angel the lord came to brother
[1:06:32] branham and said hey
[1:06:34] go call a brother webber and let him
[1:06:37] know that sister webber's
[1:06:39] crossing over
[1:06:42] she was laid up in the hospital a real
[1:06:45] gallant
[1:06:45] saint of god i believe he he refers to i
[1:06:48] believe it's the same miss weber that
[1:06:50] he tells the story about what time he
[1:06:52] got a little bit of in need and
[1:06:54] and brother branham didn't know how he's
[1:06:55] gonna pay the bills you know and he said
[1:06:57] well you know what i gotta i gotta pay
[1:07:00] the bills i
[1:07:00] i know everybody else does it i've never
[1:07:02] done it but i think i'll i'll take up an
[1:07:04] offering
[1:07:04] this morning an old brother got it his
[1:07:07] little hat started
[1:07:08] walking over he looked over there and
[1:07:10] saw a little miss weber there
[1:07:11] getting into her apron there and trying
[1:07:13] to dig out a little bit of a nickel and
[1:07:14] he's
[1:07:15] when he saw that something his heart
[1:07:16] said i'm just kidding you
[1:07:19] oh he couldn't do it he tells the story
[1:07:21] how uh somebody gave him a bike and he
[1:07:23] painted it and he sold it for what he
[1:07:24] had need of oh god always provides but
[1:07:27] now this miss weber she's laid up in the
[1:07:29] hospital and she's dying and the angel
[1:07:31] lord now has come to the prophet
[1:07:35] and said uh she she she's crossing over
[1:07:38] go get go get mr weber and tell the
[1:07:40] family
[1:07:41] so brother branham goes over there and
[1:07:43] uh to mr webber says you know
[1:07:44] the lord came to me and your wife you
[1:07:47] know and uh
[1:07:48] is gonna gonna cross over it's gonna be
[1:07:50] you and the four four kids i believe it
[1:07:51] is four or five kids
[1:07:53] uh to make ready and make preparations
[1:07:55] and one of the
[1:07:56] girls i believe was older and and
[1:07:59] brother branham had a conversation
[1:08:01] uh uh with her about uh her mom crossing
[1:08:04] over and
[1:08:05] so brother branham uh i went back home
[1:08:08] and he delivered the message from the
[1:08:10] from the lord and and you know about two
[1:08:12] days later
[1:08:13] uh some of the girls from work went up
[1:08:15] to the hospital
[1:08:16] where miss weber worked and they came in
[1:08:18] there to visit her and they got to
[1:08:20] talking and she said you know
[1:08:22] if i could get brother branham to pray
[1:08:24] for me once more i could come out of
[1:08:26] here
[1:08:27] and they said oh you and you and matt
[1:08:30] branham and that gospel
[1:08:31] there's nothing to that you know and
[1:08:34] they started to speak against the very
[1:08:36] thing that she was standing for
[1:08:39] and she said you know i just i wasn't
[1:08:42] gonna stand for that
[1:08:45] and she started to tell him look god it
[1:08:47] looks like god's gonna take me home
[1:08:50] here in a couple days and it looks like
[1:08:52] i'm going to die by a sickness
[1:08:54] but i want to tell you something i've
[1:08:57] seen it all my life and i've seen the
[1:08:59] hand of god in the prophet's life
[1:09:01] and it's thus saith the lord and it's
[1:09:03] true and it's never failed
[1:09:04] one time and he started to tell those
[1:09:07] two work girls
[1:09:09] her convictions and what she stood for
[1:09:11] while laying
[1:09:12] on her deathbed and some of us
[1:09:15] and all of our strength and all of our
[1:09:17] health won't even take the time
[1:09:20] to testify to a co-worker
[1:09:24] oh because we're putting our our pride
[1:09:27] and we're putting uh
[1:09:28] all we're counting on our ability and
[1:09:30] we're counting on our job for our
[1:09:32] stability in our welfare when our
[1:09:35] welfare should be standing upon the
[1:09:37] promised word of god
[1:09:38] heavens and earth will pass away but his
[1:09:41] world will never pass away
[1:09:43] there on her deathbed she
[1:09:47] she spoke her testimony that she
[1:09:49] believed in god and that he was a healer
[1:09:52] and that he could take her out of that
[1:09:54] bed or we could run with that a little
[1:09:56] bit just like the hebrew children oh
[1:09:58] if he delivers us praise god if he don't
[1:10:00] but he's still the same
[1:10:02] yesterday today and forever well i
[1:10:05] believe a day went by there
[1:10:07] brother branham says it was about three
[1:10:09] o'clock in the morning
[1:10:11] and here come the angel of the lord
[1:10:12] walking through the door
[1:10:14] he said i want to tell you
[1:10:17] so miss weber will be sitting in church
[1:10:19] tomorrow
[1:10:21] she's going to be sitting back up in the
[1:10:23] right oh she was dying but she wanted to
[1:10:25] go to the house of god one more time
[1:10:28] he said i want you to tell her
[1:10:32] tell her that she's not going to die i
[1:10:35] said and i want to tell you
[1:10:37] that there at the hospital the other day
[1:10:40] when she was
[1:10:40] speaking about me the angel lord
[1:10:43] happened to hear what she said
[1:10:45] and said because of that she will not
[1:10:48] die
[1:10:49] or the prophet goes to say there she is
[1:10:51] sitting in the tabernacle
[1:10:53] and that's been eight years ago oh god
[1:10:56] is
[1:10:56] listening to your words you keep
[1:10:58] standing upon the promised word
[1:11:00] you have a testimony yes we're called to
[1:11:03] have humility
[1:11:04] yes we're called to be humble but with a
[1:11:07] boldness
[1:11:08] and humility in god we can stand upon
[1:11:10] the promised word
[1:11:11] and you speak the truth
[1:11:23] as our pastor was mentioning this
[1:11:24] morning
[1:11:26] you know we can't serve god and mammon
[1:11:29] you'll serve one or the other and i just
[1:11:33] i can echo the same thing or pastor said
[1:11:35] i've got to get all the world out of me
[1:11:37] all of it
[1:11:39] i believe that's the lord speaking to us
[1:11:41] saying
[1:11:43] we can all say amen lord take all the
[1:11:46] dross
[1:11:47] take all the unbelief lord take it all
[1:11:50] out of me all the things that are of you
[1:11:52] lord
[1:11:52] i want you to take it all lord i
[1:11:54] surrender it to you lord
[1:11:56] maybe you and you alone in your word
[1:11:58] only living in me
[1:12:01] first john 2 16 says for all
[1:12:06] that is in the world the lust of the
[1:12:08] flesh
[1:12:09] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:12:12] of life
[1:12:15] is not of the father but is of the world
[1:12:19] i just want to read that out of the
[1:12:21] amplified it says
[1:12:24] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:12:28] the flesh
[1:12:28] craving for central gratification and
[1:12:31] the lust of the eyes
[1:12:33] greedy longings of the mind
[1:12:36] and the pride of life assurance and
[1:12:39] one's
[1:12:39] own resources or in the stability
[1:12:43] of earthly things
[1:12:46] now we might real not not realize
[1:12:50] how much the pride of life is truly
[1:12:53] affecting the believer assurance
[1:12:57] in one's own resources
[1:13:01] i remember when you know god bless me
[1:13:05] oh i couldn't even count the ways but i
[1:13:07] remember that just living at home
[1:13:09] with my parents and and i as i say this
[1:13:12] is a public testimony
[1:13:13] god's blessed me with a very nice house
[1:13:15] but i would never be in there if i
[1:13:17] wasn't able to live rent free for three
[1:13:19] years with my parents
[1:13:21] nothing that i did a love of a mom and
[1:13:23] dad and a love of god that provided me
[1:13:24] an opportunity
[1:13:26] nothing that i did but i remember there
[1:13:28] and and them gracious to give space for
[1:13:30] me my wife and
[1:13:32] my two kids and and you know what when
[1:13:34] you don't have no rent
[1:13:36] and then pack in the refrigerator you
[1:13:39] can save some money
[1:13:41] can you imagine not having any living
[1:13:42] expenses
[1:13:44] and all of a sudden that bank account
[1:13:46] you know i started i started seeing
[1:13:47] numbers i'd never seen before
[1:13:50] and all of a sudden you know you kind of
[1:13:52] felt good you had a little nest tag and
[1:13:53] all i said i was like wait a second
[1:13:55] no that means that could go to zero
[1:13:58] tomorrow
[1:14:00] don't start putting your trust in some
[1:14:03] 401k or some bank account or some
[1:14:06] insurance plan or some career you got
[1:14:09] because it could be gone tomorrow
[1:14:12] oh the stock market could crash and that
[1:14:14] thing could be gone that business could
[1:14:16] go bankrupt
[1:14:17] some other corporation can acquire your
[1:14:19] corporation and say we're changing the
[1:14:21] staff
[1:14:22] oh you better watch out oh the pride of
[1:14:25] life assurance and one's own resources
[1:14:28] or stability of earthly things i
[1:14:31] remember when we finally got into the
[1:14:32] house you know we
[1:14:33] we took the little money we had saved
[1:14:35] and were able to you know
[1:14:37] put it all towards the house and and i
[1:14:39] remember we came in and said well honey
[1:14:40] we're broke again but praise god we've
[1:14:42] got a nice house
[1:14:44] but you know if we ever start to let the
[1:14:48] pride of
[1:14:49] life consume us
[1:14:52] we're we're we're making a god out of it
[1:14:54] and he becomes the second
[1:14:56] or the third place just to reiterate
[1:14:59] that again
[1:15:00] assurance in one's own resources or in
[1:15:03] the stability of earthly things
[1:15:06] these do not come from the father but
[1:15:09] are from the world itself
[1:15:13] oh it can it can get real uh easy to get
[1:15:16] comfortable here in lady osea
[1:15:20] the scripture says love not the world
[1:15:23] love not the world and the things of the
[1:15:24] world if any man love the world the love
[1:15:26] of the father is not in him now
[1:15:28] now when it says love not the world you
[1:15:29] can't love the world with and
[1:15:31] that's not the agape love it's talking
[1:15:32] about but when you look at this love it
[1:15:34] even means
[1:15:35] to welcome to entertain or to be fond of
[1:15:40] or if i can maybe even say it like this
[1:15:42] tolerate the things of the world
[1:15:45] my i think a lot of times we get into a
[1:15:47] place in lady oseal
[1:15:49] where we tolerate the things of the
[1:15:51] world but paul said
[1:15:52] abhor that which is evil cleave to that
[1:15:56] which is good
[1:15:58] just moving to a close uh quickly
[1:16:01] proverbs 8 13 says the fear of the lord
[1:16:04] is to hate
[1:16:05] evil to hate pride
[1:16:08] to hate arrogancy to hate the evil way
[1:16:12] it says the fear of the lord is to hate
[1:16:14] evil pride and arrogancy
[1:16:16] and the evil way and a forward mouth do
[1:16:19] i hate
[1:16:20] all right i say god help us to possess
[1:16:23] these vessels
[1:16:24] with sanctification and honor and do as
[1:16:27] paul said
[1:16:27] i die daily oh we must die daily
[1:16:32] and maybe pride isn't what you struggle
[1:16:36] with maybe it's a complex
[1:16:38] but you know complex complexes are a
[1:16:41] serious thing
[1:16:42] uh can cause just uh equal damage if you
[1:16:46] might
[1:16:46] say where a complex can keep you out of
[1:16:49] the house of god
[1:16:51] it can keep you out of fellowship it
[1:16:53] could even keep you from
[1:16:55] from listening to your bible and and
[1:16:57] reading the word because something in
[1:16:58] you feels like oh you're not getting the
[1:17:00] things you want and so
[1:17:01] it creates this this inability
[1:17:05] for you to feed because you're you're
[1:17:07] discouraged because you feel like things
[1:17:08] aren't opening up to you
[1:17:10] well complexes are great we got to be
[1:17:12] careful of complexes
[1:17:13] as we were going through some fellowship
[1:17:14] with the brothers the prophet talks
[1:17:17] about how he built a complex
[1:17:20] and he was losing a feeling for the
[1:17:21] people and in standing in the gap he
[1:17:24] makes the confession he goes could you
[1:17:25] imagine
[1:17:27] could you imagine a blind man going to
[1:17:29] walk over a cliff
[1:17:31] and die and not say anything about it
[1:17:35] and the prophet says i i have to make a
[1:17:37] confession
[1:17:38] that's what i was fixing to do
[1:17:41] because he had lost the feeling for
[1:17:44] people in a complex
[1:17:45] because the rejection over and over of
[1:17:47] the word
[1:17:48] had gotten to a place where he just he
[1:17:51] just wanted to slip up in the mountains
[1:17:53] is that if the lord calls me down that
[1:17:55] then i'll come but
[1:17:56] but god so graciously uh dealt
[1:17:59] with with the prophet's heart and he
[1:18:01] realized he had to have a change to
[1:18:03] to get the feeling and the love back for
[1:18:05] the people
[1:18:06] and god was so gracious to that that
[1:18:09] message standing in the gap
[1:18:10] god dealt with his heart and gave him an
[1:18:12] everlasting sign there in the mountains
[1:18:14] as
[1:18:14] you can look into that but all complexes
[1:18:18] but you know pride will make you do
[1:18:21] things
[1:18:22] you shouldn't do like hezekiah
[1:18:27] and you know pride will make you do
[1:18:29] things
[1:18:31] that you shouldn't do and this kind of
[1:18:34] might sound really odd it might strike
[1:18:35] you really funny but
[1:18:36] but my pants used to hold me accountable
[1:18:41] i love dead silence but you know
[1:18:44] my pants they would hold me accountable
[1:18:46] because i'm a certain size
[1:18:48] you know and when all sudden my clothes
[1:18:50] don't fit me like they should anymore
[1:18:53] it's a reminder to me that i need to get
[1:18:56] in shape or i need to
[1:18:57] discipline myself does anybody know what
[1:19:01] i'm talking about
[1:19:03] my i'm not alone
[1:19:06] well you know when i started thinking
[1:19:08] about it some things happened in this
[1:19:09] lady ocean age
[1:19:11] where they came up with a stretchy pant
[1:19:16] you know and and and everybody wants to
[1:19:18] be comfortable you know lady oc is all
[1:19:20] about comfort
[1:19:22] you know and all of a sudden i realize
[1:19:24] i'm wearing those ones they got a little
[1:19:26] bit more stretching a little bit more
[1:19:27] often because a little bit more
[1:19:28] comfortable
[1:19:30] but someday along the line there's going
[1:19:32] to come a rude awakening
[1:19:37] if you keep carrying on undisciplined
[1:19:40] and wearing your stretchy pants wearing
[1:19:43] your religious pets
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:46] all because what did they start doing to
[1:19:47] the denim they started to sew in
[1:19:49] something called spandex
[1:19:51] they started putting in a little like
[1:19:53] elasticity
[1:19:55] and i think maybe that's a little bit of
[1:19:56] what we've been doing with the good old
[1:19:58] gospel robe that he's given us
[1:20:00] we've been starting to weave in a little
[1:20:01] pride been starting to leave we even a
[1:20:03] little elasticity
[1:20:05] so we can do the things that we want to
[1:20:07] do and we realize
[1:20:08] that we're lusting and gorging on the
[1:20:10] things of the world
[1:20:12] and you realize you ain't going to fit
[1:20:13] the good old gospel robe that way
[1:20:16] because you've got a little bit
[1:20:17] comfortable and ladies here
[1:20:19] you've started to weave in a little bit
[1:20:20] of pride you've started to weave a
[1:20:22] little into off complexes
[1:20:24] and then all of a sudden when you stand
[1:20:26] on the on the scales of god's word
[1:20:29] you realize you're out of shape
[1:20:34] yeah i've been there
[1:20:37] also and i realized my stretchy pants
[1:20:39] don't even fit anymore
[1:20:42] oh we get backslid why because we're
[1:20:45] feeding on the things we shouldn't feed
[1:20:47] on but
[1:20:47] at least my old school pants that they
[1:20:50] didn't know how to compromise
[1:20:53] they were one size not one size fits all
[1:20:57] but now the world's preaching a
[1:20:59] one-size-fits-all gospel
[1:21:01] but there's only one gospel and it only
[1:21:03] fits one size
[1:21:05] and that's the true genuine believer and
[1:21:07] if it ain't in the word i don't want it
[1:21:11] but don't try to modify your wedding
[1:21:13] garment
[1:21:14] i'm going to take my wedding garment
[1:21:17] down to the tailor
[1:21:18] and i'm going to weave in a little of
[1:21:20] this website
[1:21:21] a little of this entertainment and i can
[1:21:24] go there and i can go here
[1:21:26] shame on us let's get back to the
[1:21:29] old-fashioned gospel
[1:21:32] i don't want to make the word fit me
[1:21:37] i want to fit the word
[1:21:42] pants watch out for those things
[1:21:47] and watch out for pride and complexes
[1:21:49] and the pride of life
[1:21:51] because you'll find yourself backslidden
[1:21:55] spiritually
[1:22:09] praise the lord maybe just a
[1:22:13] move towards a close speaking about
[1:22:16] getting comfortable you know israel got
[1:22:20] comfortable
[1:22:21] down in egypt
[1:22:24] but there rose up a pharaoh that didn't
[1:22:27] know joseph
[1:22:29] but as long as there was a pharaoh that
[1:22:31] respected god's people they were
[1:22:32] comfortable
[1:22:34] they were living off the land but you
[1:22:37] know there came a time where
[1:22:38] there rose up a pharaoh that
[1:22:43] didn't know joseph and didn't know the
[1:22:45] power of god
[1:22:47] and god started to harden
[1:22:51] pharaoh's heart
[1:22:55] and that's when exodus 1 12 it says
[1:23:00] speaks of how god started to harden
[1:23:01] pharaoh's heart and they started to get
[1:23:03] fearful and
[1:23:04] worried about the children of of god
[1:23:07] whether they would maybe
[1:23:09] uh join themselves with an enemy or if
[1:23:12] they would become too great
[1:23:14] so they started to afflict them and put
[1:23:15] task masters upon them
[1:23:17] and give them burdens and you know what
[1:23:19] the the children of god started to get
[1:23:21] uncomfortable in ladies i mean in egypt
[1:23:24] they started to get a little
[1:23:26] uncomfortable
[1:23:28] and then in verse 12 it says but the
[1:23:30] more they afflicted him the more they
[1:23:31] multiplied and grew
[1:23:33] and they were grieved because of the
[1:23:35] children of israel
[1:23:37] that word grieving means it's to be
[1:23:39] grieved or
[1:23:40] loathed to abhor oh they had a sickening
[1:23:44] dread of the children of god
[1:23:46] and the prophet says why why did god
[1:23:48] have to harden pharaoh's heart
[1:23:51] to put the people back in the promised
[1:23:53] land
[1:23:54] before he could bless them to bring the
[1:23:57] messiah to them
[1:24:00] he says that's what he had to do with
[1:24:02] with with
[1:24:03] hitler's heart to be against the jew
[1:24:06] when he was half jew himself
[1:24:08] how could he have to do that to stalin
[1:24:09] mussolini see
[1:24:11] people that's not inspired like a nation
[1:24:13] they
[1:24:14] god has to take the things that they are
[1:24:17] living by
[1:24:19] the laws of the land many times to make
[1:24:22] his promises come true
[1:24:25] so he had to harden those dictators
[1:24:27] hearts to run the jew back to the
[1:24:29] promised land
[1:24:31] it had to be that way
[1:24:34] you think the condition of the age that
[1:24:36] we're living in is any coincidence
[1:24:39] you think the laws of the land and the
[1:24:41] things that are shaping up
[1:24:43] and the loathsome abhorrence for the
[1:24:45] word of god is any coincidence
[1:24:47] no it has to be that way the word said
[1:24:50] in the last days it'll be perilous times
[1:24:54] oh but we're going to overcome them uh
[1:24:57] just like he overcame and how
[1:25:00] how did christ overcome just in the very
[1:25:03] outset we were saying all
[1:25:05] by the word and
[1:25:08] humility the scripture says moses was
[1:25:11] the meekest man in the earth
[1:25:14] he was humble he was lowly
[1:25:17] but what i love about it was in that
[1:25:19] weakness
[1:25:20] in that humility that god told him to go
[1:25:24] take over
[1:25:26] egypt and make this in humility
[1:25:29] moses go on and take over let's just all
[1:25:32] stand it'll help me close
[1:25:38] go on and and take over
[1:25:42] what what would what would an old man in
[1:25:44] a stick be
[1:25:46] to pharaoh's army
[1:25:50] prophet says speaking of this he said
[1:25:54] moses had the word
[1:25:57] pharaoh had spears pharaoh had the pride
[1:26:00] of life
[1:26:02] he could count on his resources he could
[1:26:05] count on his bank account
[1:26:07] he could count on his great civilization
[1:26:09] that
[1:26:10] he had he had aspired to
[1:26:13] but moses had something greater than all
[1:26:15] of that
[1:26:16] he had thus saith the lord oh
[1:26:19] hallelujah the prophet said in proving
[1:26:21] his word that's all he needed was the
[1:26:24] word
[1:26:25] that's all you need today it's not a
[1:26:28] credential from some church
[1:26:30] you don't need a denomination to back
[1:26:32] you up you need the word to take the
[1:26:34] rapture
[1:26:35] you don't need some credential you don't
[1:26:37] need some long history of some school
[1:26:40] to be healed this morning you need to
[1:26:42] accept
[1:26:43] the word that does it you don't need the
[1:26:46] doctor's word if the doctor says he's
[1:26:48] done all he can do
[1:26:49] that's all he can do he says you got
[1:26:51] cancer
[1:26:52] tumor you're going blind you're deaf
[1:26:55] dumb
[1:26:55] whatever it is that doesn't matter if
[1:26:59] you
[1:27:00] could take that word to that burning
[1:27:02] promise of the bush yonder amen
[1:27:06] something's going to happen oh what was
[1:27:09] that burning bush yonder it was the
[1:27:12] pillar of fire
[1:27:13] it was the angel of the covenant i want
[1:27:15] to ask you where is the pillar of fire
[1:27:18] where is the angel of the covenant he
[1:27:21] didn't leave he's not off the scene

[1:27:26] tell
[1:27:26] joshua he said as i was with moses so
[1:27:30] shall i be with you joshua being a type
[1:27:34] of the holy ghost

[1:27:41] shall see me because i'll be with you
[1:27:45] i'll be even in you at that day
[1:27:48] oh the prophet said this day when the
[1:27:51] revelation comes forth

[1:29:11] for communion scripture just coming on
[1:29:14] my heart
[1:29:15] as matthew was speaking you know the
[1:29:17] lord said they'll know you're
[1:29:19] my disciples by your love
[1:29:22] one for another he could have given a
[1:29:24] lot of different descriptions huh
[1:29:27] they know you are my disciples because
[1:29:28] you raised the dead they know you are my
[1:29:30] disciples because of this
[1:29:33] because of that but he said you'll know
[1:29:35] that you are my disciple or in other
[1:29:37] words a disciple
[1:29:38] somebody that patterns their life
[1:29:41] after that person he said you'll know
[1:29:43] they are my disciples
[1:29:45] by your love one for another
[1:29:48] it's nice to have brother manuel ruth
[1:29:51] correa
[1:29:52] with us tonight they're uh they're
[1:29:55] headed back to phoenix to help their
[1:29:58] family that's in some situations at this
[1:30:01] time and
[1:30:02] and uh so they won't be with us for a
[1:30:05] while
[1:30:06] but they're going to go back and and to
[1:30:09] there so
[1:30:10] we definitely want to tell them how much
[1:30:12] we've appreciated the
[1:30:14] three years that they've been here with
[1:30:16] us and he's cut my hair
[1:30:18] and taking care of me and it's been a
[1:30:21] blessing so
[1:30:22] either i'm going to grow my hair long
[1:30:24] and my beard longer
[1:30:26] he's going to have to come out and take
[1:30:28] care of me but
[1:30:29] anyway so we're grateful for all that
[1:30:32] they've contributed and helped us here
[1:30:34] and
[1:30:35] and uh so we hope that all things can be
[1:30:38] taken care of there soon
[1:30:40] and they can certainly make it back to
[1:30:42] be with us
[1:30:44] let us read here he says i have received
[1:30:46] the lord
[1:30:47] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:30:51] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:30:53] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:30:56] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:31:00] and said take eat this is
[1:31:03] my body which is broken for you
[1:31:06] this do in remembrance of me
[1:31:10] and after the same manner also he took
[1:31:12] the cup
[1:31:13] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:31:16] the new testament
[1:31:18] in my blood this duty as often as ye
[1:31:21] drink it
[1:31:22] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:31:26] eat this bread
[1:31:27] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:31:29] lord's death till he come
[1:31:32] whosoever wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:31:36] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:31:39] lord unworthily
[1:31:41] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:31:44] the lord
[1:31:46] but let a man examine himself and
[1:31:49] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:31:52] of that cup this was a good sermon
[1:31:55] tonight
[1:31:56] to examine yourself by
[1:31:59] amen and for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:32:02] unworthily eateth and drink of damnation
[1:32:05] to himself
[1:32:07] not discerning the lord's body for this
[1:32:10] cause many are weak and
[1:32:12] sickly among you and many sleep
[1:32:15] for if we could judge ourselves
[1:32:18] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:32:21] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:32:24] we should not
[1:32:25] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:32:28] brethren
[1:32:29] when ye come together to eat tarry
[1:32:32] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:32:35] let him eat at home that you come not
[1:32:38] together unto condemnation
[1:32:41] and the rest will i set in order
[1:32:44] when i come
[1:32:54] our gracious heavenly father is
[1:32:58] we come together tonight to partake in
[1:33:00] communion
[1:33:02] father the words that our brother
[1:33:04] matthew spoke to us
[1:33:06] father reminds us of the humility and
[1:33:10] and even the humility that you humbled
[1:33:12] yourself
[1:33:13] even under the death of the cross that
[1:33:16] by giving of yourself
[1:33:18] that we could live and that we could
[1:33:21] partake of
[1:33:22] life freely and lord have eternal life
[1:33:26] and the confidence that we possess life
[1:33:30] and life's more abundant father in that
[1:33:33] death has no sting
[1:33:34] and it has no victory over us but father

[1:33:41] have one
[1:33:41] waiting for us what a fellowship the
[1:33:44] believer has

[1:33:56] father and it's a communion one with
[1:33:59] another
[1:34:00] that our loves would be blended together
[1:34:03] father we ask you to bless this bread
[1:34:05] that represents your body
[1:34:07] which was given father for us that it by
[1:34:10] its stripes father we were healed
[1:34:13] and heavenly father we ask you to bless
[1:34:15] this wine father
