[20:51] way God Will Make A
[20:56] Way Brother D
[21:02] testimony and also something else to
[21:05] keep in mind uh brother Troy was headed
[21:08] out with his family to go see his dad
[21:11] and before he could get there and say
[21:13] his goodbyes his father passed away so
[21:15] if you could keep them in prayer as
[21:24] well God bless you Saints it's good to
[21:27] be in the house of the Lord amen
[21:31] um I got a long testimony but I'm going
[21:33] to cut it down real short um about two
[21:37] or three weeks ago I guess it was I I
[21:38] messed up my knee bad at work don't even
[21:41] know how I did it I guess getting old is
[21:43] what it is but uh I'm making made a
[21:45] wrong move and sure enough my knee it
[21:48] was so bad I mean it was it was bad I
[21:50] almost had to crawl to the bathroom in
[21:51] the middle of the night to go to the
[21:52] bathroom it was it was horrible so
[21:54] anyway I went to work and uh these
[21:57] painters that I work with and play golf
[21:59] with time to time he asked me he said I
[22:01] said what are you going to do man you
[22:02] know he don't knows I don't have no
[22:03] insurance I said well you know and soon
[22:07] as he said that thing that come to my
[22:08] mind was when brother brandom said he
[22:10] had usance and I said well you know what
[22:13] I said I'm going to do the one thing and
[22:14] I can do and I said that's claim Jesus
[22:16] Christ has already healed me I said
[22:18] because I have nowhere else to go man
[22:21] they kind of looked at me funny you know
[22:22] and I I figured they would that's fine
[22:24] but every day they would ask me and and
[22:26] for like the next couple weeks I just it
[22:28] was it wasn't wasn't getting any better
[22:29] it really wasn't and um it was killing
[22:31] me keep me up throughout the night and
[22:34] whatnot and
[22:37] uh so
[22:41] anyway every day they would ask me how's
[22:43] it getting and how how are you better I
[22:44] said man I tell you I'm Healed getting
[22:46] stronger every day you know deep down
[22:48] inside they can see me I look like a
[22:49] walking around you I was just
[22:51] anyway but you can't look to what's
[22:53] going down you got to look to the
[22:54] promise you know cuz without faith it's
[22:57] impossible to please God and faith is
[22:58] the true key to uh Miracles you know and
[23:04] another thing Brother David was talking

[23:24] couch up the turned the couch over
[23:26] looking for these things they were not
[23:28] nowhere to be found well yesterday
[23:30] before I went to went to work yesterday
[23:31] morning and um man KNE was still killing
[23:34] me my wife wanted to pray say a prayer
[23:36] together before I left for work I said

[23:41] the couch she stayed in front of the
[23:43] couch and knelt down in front of the
[23:44] couch so we said our prayers and during
[23:47] the prayer I said Lord I said I you know
[23:49] how badly I need my keys returned and um
[23:52] I can't find them and I said Lord I
[23:54] could have thrown them things away and
[23:55] they could be in the city dump right now
[23:56] I said but I know for a fact you can

[41:28] Psalm
[41:38] 23 amen I'm many to enjoy the the word
[41:41] this
[41:41] morning amen I tell you that that that
[41:47] that Bible story is the very Foundation
[41:51] of what a Christian is amen Psalm 23 it
[41:55] says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[41:58] want he maketh me lie in Green Pastures
[42:03] he leadth me beside the Still Waters he
[42:06] restoreth my soul he leadth me in the
[42:09] path of righteousness for his name's
[42:11] sake yay though I walk through the
[42:14] valley of the Shadows of death I will
[42:17] not fear evil for thou are with me thy
[42:21] rod and thy staff they comfort
[42:24] me thou prepareth a table before me in
[42:27] the presence of my
[42:29] enemy thou anointed my head with oil my
[42:33] cup my cup runneth over surely goodness
[42:36] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[42:40] of my life and I will dwell in the house
[42:43] of the Lord forever let's also turn to
[42:48] um a couple of pages over Psalm uh 46
[43:02] says the Lord is my refuge and my
[43:04] strength a very present help in trouble
[43:09] therefore I will not fear though the
[43:12] Earth be moved removed and though the
[43:15] mountain be carried out in the midst of
[43:17] the sea though the water there therefore
[43:21] Roar and be troubled though the
[43:24] mountains shake with swelling thereof
[43:27] there is a river the stream thereof
[43:30] shall make glad the city of God the holy
[43:35] place of the Tabernacle of the most high
[43:39] God is in the midst of her she shall not
[43:42] be moved God shall help her and that
[43:46] right
[43:48] early the Heathen rages raged and the
[43:52] kingdom were moved he uttered his voice
[43:56] the Earth melt melted the Lord of hosts
[43:59] is with us the god of Jacob is our
[44:03] refuge come Behold The Works of the
[44:08] Lord was uh what desolate he had made in
[44:13] the earth he maketh War to seize unto
[44:16] the end of the Earth he breakthoughs and
[44:20] cutteth the Spears in
[44:22] Thunder he burneth The Chariot in the
[44:26] fire be still and know that I am God I
[44:30] will be exalted among the Heathen I will
[44:34] be exalted in the Earth the Lord of host
[44:39] is with us the god of Jacob is our
[44:42] refuge let's turn one more scripture to
[44:46] um Deuteronomy
[44:48] chapter uh
[44:50] 31 the 3 uh first chapter we'll read um
[44:57] let's start from verse one it says and
[45:01] Moses went and spake these words unto
[45:04] all
[45:05] Israel and he said unto them I am an
[45:11] 120 years old this
[45:14] day and I can I can no more go out and
[45:19] come in also the Lord had said unto me
[45:23] Thou shalt not go over this Jordan
[45:28] the Lord thy God he will go over before
[45:32] thee and he will destroy these nations
[45:35] from before thee and thou shalt possess
[45:38] them and Joshua he shall go over with
[45:42] before
[45:43] thee as the Lord has
[45:46] said and the Lord shall go shall do unto
[45:52] these unto them as he did to Silo and OG
[45:56] Kings of amorites and unto the land of
[46:00] them whom he destroyed and the Lord
[46:03] shall give them up before your face and
[46:07] ye it says that ye may do unto them
[46:11] according to all the Commandment which
[46:13] he had commanded you be strong and of
[46:17] good courage fear
[46:21] not nor be afraid of them for the Lord
[46:24] thy God is with thee he that he that
[46:28] goeth with thee he will not fail thee
[46:31] nor forsake thee father we ask that you
[46:34] bless your word to us in the name of
[46:36] Jesus Christ we pray
[46:39] amen I just want to for a few minutes
[46:42] try not to be too long uh speak based on
[46:47] those words we just read I want to title
[46:50] it um do not fear have faith do not fear
[46:56] have faith
[46:57] so as we read these words in the Bible
[47:02] these will look to be uh the words of
[47:05] encouragement there will look to be some
[47:08] reassuring words that God was speaking
[47:10] to the children of Israel he's letting
[47:13] them know in advance that uh it really
[47:17] doesn't matter what you encounter along
[47:19] the
[47:20] way um I don't want you to be
[47:23] fearful and if one would speak like that
[47:26] I believe that you will be mindful that
[47:29] along the way there could have been
[47:31] challenges that would arise and that
[47:33] along life Journey we would encounter
[47:36] things that would try to create fear in
[47:39] our hearts and in our lives and there
[47:41] would be things
[47:43] that we come against us where it would
[47:47] look like the promises are far off that
[47:49] we won't be able to get
[47:51] it but he telling them that in the midst
[47:53] of all of that that along the journey
[47:57] one of the things that's required for a
[48:00] Believer is to not be
[48:03] fearful whatever it doesn't matter what
[48:06] battle you're going through tonight as
[48:08] we're sitting here it doesn't matter
[48:10] what challenge you're facing as we're
[48:12] sitting here the promise to the believer
[48:15] in God's word is that I will be with
[48:18] thee I will I promise that I will carry
[48:22] you over that I will continue to be with
[48:24] you that no matter what the challenges
[48:27] before you don't be afraid be strong be
[48:31] of good courage as the scripture will
[48:33] say it says for the Lord your God is
[48:36] with thee and that promise was not made
[48:39] just for that time and we understand I
[48:41] can say this that promise is attached to
[48:45] every verse every promise in the Bible
[48:48] every time you read God will say I'm the
[48:51] Savior I'm the Healer whatever he claims
[48:54] that he is when you as a believer you
[48:57] take that word for yourself you believe
[48:59] it with it you have to attach the
[49:01] promise that don't be afraid don't be
[49:04] scared to believe this stand strong
[49:07] because if you believe my word I will
[49:09] come and make my promise real to you
[49:13] that the presence of the Lord will be
[49:15] with you every single step of the way
[49:18] that he promised to fight your battles
[49:21] he promised to provide for your needs
[49:23] that he promised to give you victory
[49:26] that he promised that whatever happens
[49:29] that you should trust in him that he
[49:31] will give you what you have need of now
[49:35] and I'll read some things that says
[49:38] about fear and and the things one of the
[49:41] things you realize that as we read the
[49:44] Bible you one of the things you'll
[49:45] realize that that when when when when we
[49:49] hear the word of God is uh God is
[49:52] wanting us to enter into uh a mindset
[49:57] that's different from what this world
[49:59] has to offer the word of God is not
[50:02] given for this flesh here so we can hear
[50:05] come to church hear the word of God and
[50:07] reason it up here so we can try to
[50:10] understand what is God really trying to
[50:12] say but the word of God is given to us
[50:16] so so we can so it can give us
[50:19] introduction into the land of
[50:23] promise so it can give us an
[50:25] introduction as I like what our Pastor
[50:28] said this morning I just made such a
[50:30] statement I thought Satan is here
[50:33] framing up everything around us how we
[50:36] should always consider the situation in
[50:39] front of us he will put the challenge he
[50:41] will tell you oh for you to get a good
[50:44] job you got to get an education you got
[50:46] to get this you got to do this in order
[50:48] for you to obtain so we all have that
[50:51] understanding as humans we we know that
[50:53] if you you work hard you you will now
[50:56] it's not even working hard anymore it's
[50:57] the one who worked the smartest if you
[50:59] work smart you'll get a good job you'll
[51:01] do this you'll do that and and if you do
[51:04] this this will happen so we have that as
[51:06] a human understanding of what the
[51:09] expectation is for what we put in but
[51:12] God is wanting us to fly way above those
[51:15] things he doesn't want us that
[51:17] everything we hear everything we ask you
[51:20] know if you're sick if you go to a
[51:22] doctor they'll give you a prescription
[51:23] and if to take that prescription you'll
[51:25] be well and we understand that God gives
[51:28] the doctors the intelligence for them to
[51:30] do those things he wants us to believe
[51:32] in doctors and everything but he at the
[51:34] same times he makes statements that are
[51:37] beyond what we know as humans he will
[51:40] tell us that if the doctors cannot help
[51:42] you you have the right to go to God he
[51:45] will tell us if you have faith in God it
[51:47] doesn't matter what you're looking for
[51:50] God will create and he will create an
[51:52] opportunity for you to receive what
[51:54] you're looking for so he doesn't want us
[51:56] to just be caught up in with the the the
[51:59] the the circumstances how the enemy is
[52:02] presenting it but he's wanting us to
[52:04] have an ability of Faith inside of us to
[52:08] understand it's by faith that we please
[52:10] God and to utilize the faith that's
[52:13] inside of us to obtain the promises of
[52:15] God because we understand we are saved
[52:18] by faith we are healed by faith the
[52:21] promises of God are not obtained by
[52:23] going through the human channel the
[52:26] things of of God are obtained by going
[52:28] through the faith Channel but one of
[52:30] them calls it the six sense that God is
[52:32] placed inside of a believer that you
[52:34] will go by the six sense and ask and
[52:37] receive what God has promised so when we
[52:40] hear the word of God is introducing Us
[52:43] in the land of opportunities it's a land
[52:47] where all things are possible it's the
[52:49] land where a God is taking your
[52:52] inabilities your abilities your fear and
[52:55] whatever it is that you're facing all
[52:57] the challenges and everything about you
[53:00] God is bypassing all of those things in
[53:03] order to give you what you are looking
[53:05] for so we don't say oh I got it because
[53:09] I'm strong or I got it because we're
[53:11] regardless of whatever challenge you're
[53:13] facing regardless of where you are in
[53:16] life regardless of whatever you're
[53:18] facing that by faith God can raise you
[53:21] up Faith was given so when our our
[53:24] normal eyesight will end when we will
[53:28] look and we don't know what to do
[53:29] anymore when we'll look and do the
[53:31] calculation and don't know what to do
[53:33] faith is given to raise us up from The
[53:36] Human Side and to bring us into the
[53:39] kingdom of God the scripture will say
[53:42] that God has in his economy there's
[53:44] untapped resources in the kingdom of God
[53:48] that are made available to the Believers
[53:50] but for us to access those uh resources
[53:53] what we need is faith we don't need
[53:55] intelligence we don't need uh strength
[53:58] we don't need what we need is the
[54:00] channel of faith for us to access those
[54:03] anti resources and bring them down so
[54:07] therefore it's by faith that we please
[54:09] God and let me say this fear will not
[54:11] help you uh fear only is there to make
[54:15] sure that whatever you are fearing will
[54:18] come to
[54:19] happen and and we'll touch on some of
[54:21] that as the prophet will say so i i t
[54:25] about this story
[54:27] but David was reading this morning about
[54:29] the blind
[54:30] man and here he is in the circumstance
[54:34] that he was in and and Jesus said this
[54:37] The Marvelous words that he said they
[54:39] asked him he says well wh why is this m
[54:42] this person blind is it because uh H uh
[54:45] somebody because he sinned well he was
[54:48] born blind so I don't understand what
[54:50] did he sin before he was born or after
[54:53] you just have to go figure that one out
[54:55] so they ask is it because it did sin or
[54:57] is it because the parent sin and all of
[54:59] that and I like how Jesus answered the
[55:02] question and says no it was born blind
[55:05] for the glory that it says for the
[55:07] reason that everything that it may be
[55:10] for the glory of God and I thought if we
[55:13] as Believers can have that type of
[55:15] access or that type of understanding for
[55:17] every circumstances that he would we can
[55:20] come to the house of God or within our
[55:22] own lives we could be assured that if
[55:25] something happened to me it doesn't mean
[55:28] God became against me or he's for me it
[55:31] doesn't matter I did wrong or I did
[55:34] right but all of this is for one purpose
[55:37] that God may have the glory I thought if
[55:40] we can have that kind of approach it
[55:41] will help us a lot so we can understand
[55:44] that it it's it's God chose to allow
[55:47] things to happen he can choose to for
[55:50] for sickness to come upon you he will
[55:52] let the sickness come upon you he will
[55:54] let circumstance he will let what
[55:56] whatever it is come upon you that at the
[55:58] end of the day that it may be for his
[56:01] glory that when he will come and
[56:03] manifest himself it will be for his
[56:05] glory and not yours so we can understand
[56:08] as children of God I don't have to fear
[56:10] if I'm sick today I don't have to fear
[56:13] and say oh why am I sick I must have
[56:15] done wrong and oh I'm sick because this
[56:17] happened I lost my job because no that
[56:20] we as the children of God as the people
[56:22] of God can be assur that God has
[56:25] everything everything under his control
[56:28] that if he let anything happens to me is
[56:31] for His glory and my position and my job
[56:34] is to worship Him in whatever States I
[56:37] find
[56:38] myself whether I find myself in Texas
[56:41] today in Louisiana tomorrow I Will
[56:44] Worship the Lord whether I everything is
[56:46] going good whe everything is going
[56:49] whatever state whatever whether it's
[56:51] happiness whatever whether I have it I
[56:53] don't have it my focus is I want to give
[56:57] God the glory I want to worship him for
[56:59] what it don't let fear creep in and
[57:02] start to bring things that you did years
[57:04] ago oh it must have been because you did
[57:06] that over there because you did God
[57:08] knows all about it and as the children
[57:11] of God we know when we do wrong we go
[57:13] back and say Aba father and when we say
[57:16] the scripture tells us you are forgiven
[57:18] when you say that it's thr in the sea of
[57:21] of God forgetfulness never to be
[57:23] remembered anymore that I don't have to
[57:25] go and it up and say well because I did
[57:28] that even though he forgave me he still
[57:30] wants to punish me that's not the god
[57:32] that we serve but when I I ask AB father
[57:35] and I ask for forgiveness he forgives me
[57:38] and that is gone whatever happens is for
[57:42] His
[57:44] glory so God because he knows that he's
[57:47] working everything for our good he
[57:50] allows men to be born blind and let me
[57:52] say this he allowed that man to be born
[57:55] blind so Jesus can come and take away
[57:58] the blindness and cause the situation
[58:01] like we heard it this
[58:02] morning but it's for his glory now if we
[58:06] get to a place where we now attribute
[58:09] some things to God and some to the devil
[58:11] to whom do we really
[58:14] belong you know if we can get to a place
[58:17] where something good happens we
[58:19] attribute it to God and something bad
[58:21] happened oh he must be the devil well
[58:23] the scripture will tell us it says some
[58:26] Sunshine doesn't mean God is always for
[58:28] you is is for you or rign it doesn't
[58:31] mean that God is against you he loves
[58:34] you regardless you are his to begin with
[58:37] the relationship that we have with God I
[58:39] was thinking about this when his deciple
[58:42] came and asked him and says how should
[58:44] we pray the first word that he said come
[58:46] out of the mouth it says our father
[58:48] who's in heaven he didn't say oh come
[58:51] and say oh oh a great Creator or
[58:54] whatever no he wants you to know that
[58:56] the very first relationship he wants you
[58:59] to have with him is Son and and a father
[59:02] and son relationship and Father and Son
[59:05] relationship you can punish your son but
[59:07] it doesn't mean you don't love him
[59:09] anymore you can punish you can do
[59:11] whatever but at the end of the day you
[59:13] know it's for the good of that son for
[59:15] you to restore them it's not that you
[59:18] have rejected them it's not because you
[59:20] have changed or you no longer love you
[59:23] love them today you don't love them
[59:24] tomorrow but the relation ship doesn't
[59:27] change regardless of what the
[59:28] circumstance is and he wants us to be
[59:31] aware of
[59:36] that
[59:39] so what renam will say the let me just
[59:43] say this before I read it says the the
[59:46] the the very nature in
[59:49] human is born with fear passed down
[59:57] you
[59:59] know I say this my wife forgive me my
[1:00:02] wife is afraid of dogs
[1:00:04] and and and so my kids they are born
[1:00:08] with the same fear like they'll see a
[1:00:10] dog and they just Ry like and and and I
[1:00:14] like dogs I grew up I with dogs and I
[1:00:16] like and my wife has been so just afraid
[1:00:18] of dogs and she's passed that on to the
[1:00:21] kids and I'm look and I'm like these
[1:00:23] guys are just so little why are they so
[1:00:25] afraid of dogs it doesn't matter the
[1:00:27] size of the dog it's just when the dog
[1:00:29] looks at them and they you know when the
[1:00:31] dog is looking the other side they can
[1:00:33] play with them the moment he turn and
[1:00:35] looks at them they run away so you you
[1:00:38] we are born with a W with with fear as
[1:00:41] part of the nature and I want to say
[1:00:43] this this is actually connected to the
[1:00:45] very uh first disobedient to the word of
[1:00:49] God because if you go read you realize
[1:00:51] that it's after Adam's sin when God came
[1:00:55] and probably read it in a moment here
[1:00:57] when Adam came and when God came down in
[1:01:00] the Garden of Eden he said Adam Adam
[1:01:02] where are he said I hear because I was
[1:01:07] fearful now before that when you go read
[1:01:10] and you go read the message you go that
[1:01:13] there was never that was not the
[1:01:14] relationship that God established with
[1:01:16] him there there was no such thing as
[1:01:19] fear when he came to God he talked to
[1:01:21] God like his father he fellowshipped
[1:01:23] with God they talked about everything
[1:01:25] they came and fellowship the moment sin
[1:01:28] came in fear came
[1:01:31] in so so that that God don't want us to
[1:01:34] be fearful to come and say well I go to
[1:01:37] church because I'm afraid I'm going to
[1:01:38] go to hell don't do that that that's not
[1:01:41] the nature God wants us to have to serve
[1:01:44] God and say well I'm fearful if I don't
[1:01:46] serve him I'm going to be lost no that's
[1:01:48] not what God wants you to do what God
[1:01:50] wants you to do is to serve him by love
[1:01:53] God wants you to serve him because your
[1:01:55] heart wants to serve him God wants to
[1:01:57] serve him because you have a heart
[1:01:59] within you that beats because you want
[1:02:01] to see him glorified there's something
[1:02:03] in you that wants to see him glorify you
[1:02:06] he's done something for you and you want
[1:02:09] in return for people to know that God
[1:02:11] has done something for
[1:02:13] me the the approach is not for us to be
[1:02:16] fearful well if I don't serve him
[1:02:19] something bad is going to happen to me
[1:02:21] so if I don't do this this is going to
[1:02:23] happen to me that's not the kind of
[1:02:24] relationship you wants us to have so so
[1:02:28] the the first
[1:02:29] inclination what of fear is is for the
[1:02:33] reason why we have fear we will find out
[1:02:36] is because we want to self preses
[1:02:39] ourselves
[1:02:40] self-preservation oh I I don't want to
[1:02:42] do that because if I do that and
[1:02:44] everything goes wrong what am I what
[1:02:46] people are going to think about me what
[1:02:48] if I do that and I fail what if I try
[1:02:50] and then I fail you know it so you find
[1:02:53] out it's more connected to the flesh
[1:02:55] than it is to your spiritual
[1:02:58] being and and we're going to get there
[1:03:01] so now I'm realizing I'm going to be
[1:03:02] long
[1:03:05] so so so so God in his word it says that
[1:03:11] uh he's made us because he wants us to
[1:03:14] trust on him in everything and the only
[1:03:18] it says and the only way to move outside
[1:03:22] uh and the only way to move outside of
[1:03:25] this fear
[1:03:26] or or this being afraid and and this
[1:03:29] relationship of being afraid is to be
[1:03:31] born again of the spirit of God because
[1:03:35] let me say this a Christian is not one
[1:03:37] who goes and memorize the whole Bible
[1:03:40] and tries to figure out what is God said
[1:03:42] and didn't say no the a Christian is one
[1:03:46] who's been born again by the spirit of
[1:03:48] God because it's only by the spirit of
[1:03:51] God that you can serve God because if
[1:03:53] you try to serve him by the in like you
[1:03:55] will fail by the intellect the
[1:03:58] relationship will be like what I'm
[1:03:59] talking about it's by fear it's by
[1:04:02] trying to understanding it's by
[1:04:03] reasoning is by all of that but if you
[1:04:06] serve him because you have his Spirit
[1:04:08] you're going to serve him by
[1:04:12] love so faith is given to us is given to
[1:04:17] us so it can remove the fear elements is
[1:04:21] given to us so we can uh uh uh stop and
[1:04:25] understand that that it's not by Our Own
[1:04:26] Strength it's by God's strength so you
[1:04:29] cannot see uh what you cannot see by the
[1:04:32] natural faith is there to give it to you
[1:04:35] now brother bam talks about this uh uh
[1:04:38] uh uh this is in the message how can I
[1:04:40] overcome uh paragraph 92 and he says
[1:04:44] this it says now now see I said this in
[1:04:48] the beginning you are born
[1:04:52] defeated you are born defeated and and
[1:04:55] that birth can never bring you to life
[1:04:59] so by by the nature itself when we look
[1:05:02] at this we can certainly say there's no
[1:05:06] way to please God by the natural birth
[1:05:09] there's no way to be a successful
[1:05:11] Christian by the natural birth it says
[1:05:14] you are born defeated you you you are
[1:05:17] born defeated and the birth and that
[1:05:20] birth can never bring you to life
[1:05:22] because you are born defeated and it
[1:05:24] says you are in a defeated World among
[1:05:27] defeated people it says among defeated
[1:05:30] Creed defeated denominations you've got
[1:05:34] to come to Victory somewh it says now we
[1:05:37] begin to explain how we get to Victory
[1:05:40] it says it's just like a lily he says a
[1:05:43] lily I like that one of the most
[1:05:44] prettiest flower that there is he says
[1:05:47] I'm very fond I'm very fond of those
[1:05:50] great kalais and Pon Lily and I think
[1:05:53] there's nothing hardly as pretty is this
[1:05:56] big Pond Lily it says call it water lily
[1:05:59] it's radiant it says now it says where
[1:06:02] does it come from it says it's a little
[1:06:05] seed down in the mo bottom of the marck
[1:06:09] MIP Pon the little seed it says yet all
[1:06:13] the radiance that's ever will shine is
[1:06:16] in it it is right in there it says right
[1:06:19] then it says when it's when it's in the
[1:06:22] mud but but it has to strive daily
[1:06:26] knowing that there is something and let
[1:06:28] me say this that's why I said you must
[1:06:30] be born again because when you are born
[1:06:33] again something within your heart tells
[1:06:36] you that there's something out there
[1:06:38] something something within your heart
[1:06:40] tells you that there's healing out there
[1:06:42] that I can obtain there's salvation out
[1:06:44] there that I can obtain there is
[1:06:46] something in the kingdom of God that I
[1:06:48] can partake of so it's the new birth
[1:06:52] it's by the new birth that we're going
[1:06:53] to obtain that so the hearts a Believer
[1:06:56] God places the seed inside of your heart
[1:06:59] and one day you hear the word of God the
[1:07:01] word of God strikes your heart and
[1:07:04] causes Faith to begin inside of your
[1:07:06] heart and by faith you believe the word
[1:07:09] of God and you are saved by the faith
[1:07:11] that you believe you are saved by
[1:07:13] believing in what you're hearing and God
[1:07:15] comes behind it and proves it to be a
[1:07:19] reality it says it's black it's dirty
[1:07:22] it's mkey it's slimy it says in that
[1:07:25] slime time that it's living in yet it
[1:07:28] prices way through the mck through the
[1:07:31] through the mud to the mck and the
[1:07:33] waters it says and stagger it stagnant
[1:07:36] places until it sticks his head above
[1:07:39] all the light and he Express and and and
[1:07:43] it expresses what's been hid in it all
[1:07:47] this time and but whatam says this it
[1:07:49] says I think that's an overcomer he says
[1:07:53] that once in sin once did the things
[1:07:56] that was wrong don't worry about it now
[1:07:59] he says once did the things that was
[1:08:02] wrong then he says now why look back
[1:08:06] into the pond again see it says in
[1:08:09] paragraph uh 95 it says God by
[1:08:13] predestination see has brought the seed
[1:08:17] into life and he presses itself see
[1:08:21] coming to light and now on top of all of
[1:08:24] that it's an overc
[1:08:25] see it doesn't Express itself down there
[1:08:29] it gets it's getting up to express it to
[1:08:33] express itself it says now it says
[1:08:36] neither did you it says in your sin and
[1:08:39] adultery and everything that you lived
[1:08:41] in did you express nothing uh did you
[1:08:44] didn't Express nothing but there was a
[1:08:47] seed in there and it got a it got a
[1:08:50] chance to press itself to the light and
[1:08:53] now you are in the presence of Jesus
[1:08:55] Christ Christ with a sunlight it says
[1:08:58] and it broughts and it brings and it
[1:09:00] broughts out of uh it broughts it
[1:09:04] brought out what you really was in the
[1:09:07] beginning see what it says what you see
[1:09:11] what I mean you saw the light you
[1:09:14] bloomed out you laid out your heart open
[1:09:18] now you are a lily so so the process is
[1:09:22] that you were in sin and trespass you
[1:09:24] were in the things of the world and you
[1:09:26] were dead in sin and trespass by the
[1:09:29] hearing of the word of God by the
[1:09:31] hearing of the word of God something
[1:09:33] struck your heart you got born again and
[1:09:37] you stopped the process of the
[1:09:39] manifestation or the process of the
[1:09:41] expression of what was inside of heart
[1:09:44] and let me say this the question I want
[1:09:46] to ask tonight what if the pond L said
[1:09:49] that I'm fearful I cannot do
[1:09:52] it what if the Pond Lily said well I'm
[1:09:55] looking around all I see is the mud it's
[1:09:58] the Mark is all of this and all I see is
[1:10:01] the challenges that I'm surrounded by
[1:10:04] all I see is the impossibility for me to
[1:10:07] do what I'm supposed to do I heard the
[1:10:09] word I heard that I'm called and I heard
[1:10:11] that I can do all those things but yet I
[1:10:14] know at the same time when I look at the
[1:10:16] circumstances around me there's no way
[1:10:19] for me to get there it would have stayed
[1:10:21] right there but the process is because
[1:10:24] he heard the word of God
[1:10:25] and there was a seat inside that wanted
[1:10:28] to please God there was a seat inside
[1:10:30] that says that I'm better than what I'm
[1:10:33] seeing I'm better than what I'm looking
[1:10:35] at so it press its way through the word
[1:10:38] that he had received it press his word
[1:10:41] butam says one place that the reason why
[1:10:43] it was pricing it says because the sun
[1:10:45] was calling it The reason why it was
[1:10:48] pricing is because the sun was on the
[1:10:50] other side calling and let me say this
[1:10:52] the only reason you can press is because
[1:10:54] there's the word of God that's calling
[1:10:56] on the other
[1:10:59] side but if if fear was introduced in
[1:11:03] the process there was no way to get to
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:07] result so fear is the biggest hindrance
[1:11:11] brother bam says to the
[1:11:18] church the scripture will say in Genesis
[1:11:22] 3 And1 it says
[1:11:25] and I said I heard the
[1:11:29] voice I heard that voice in the garden
[1:11:32] and I was afraid because I was naked and
[1:11:34] I hid
[1:11:41] myself that's the very first place in
[1:11:43] the
[1:11:45] Bible that word afraid is being
[1:11:50] used to be afraid means is the feeling
[1:11:54] of fear or anxiety or
[1:11:57] frighten worry that something
[1:12:00] undesirable will
[1:12:01] occur or be
[1:12:04] done the unwilling or reluctance to do
[1:12:07] something for fear or
[1:12:13] Consequences in other word Adam was
[1:12:18] there and
[1:12:20] something within him was afraid that if
[1:12:24] he showed up before God something bad
[1:12:26] was going to
[1:12:29] happen so this is the person that he
[1:12:31] talked to every night the scriptures
[1:12:35] will tell us that God came in the cool
[1:12:36] of the evening and he fellowship with
[1:12:38] them but this one day all of the sudden
[1:12:41] God shows up he's not at the meeting
[1:12:43] point and God calls for him and he said
[1:12:47] I was
[1:12:48] afraid so it's sin that introduces fear
[1:12:52] in the hearts of men I I was thinking
[1:12:54] about I was looking for it I couldn't
[1:12:56] find it and but mam talks about the I
[1:12:59] believe it was a couple of boys that
[1:13:01] were put to be put in the death row and
[1:13:04] they were I don't know if it was in
[1:13:06] Houston or somewhere where they were
[1:13:07] about to uh to go on death row and so
[1:13:10] they called for a prayer meeting and
[1:13:11] they invited brother bam to come preach
[1:13:14] and so he he came and he he was
[1:13:16] preaching and looking about the
[1:13:17] circumstance and what was happening and
[1:13:20] so he he says he makes a statement I and
[1:13:23] and if you could find it you could put
[1:13:25] it up and and I'm pretty sure most of
[1:13:27] you know so he said if you are in
[1:13:29] circumstances like this he says that
[1:13:32] fear will not help you amen it says that
[1:13:35] yeah they are you perhaps in the
[1:13:37] situation it says all fear is going to
[1:13:40] do is make sure that whatever you're
[1:13:42] waiting for will happen but it says that
[1:13:45] faith can help you in that kind of
[1:13:47] circumstance faith will change the
[1:13:50] circumstance faith can come and and
[1:13:52] deliver you uh it's like being sick and
[1:13:55] you are afraid all you're doing is
[1:13:57] you're just accelerating the process it
[1:14:01] it's like being sick or something is
[1:14:03] happening to you and and here you are
[1:14:05] and you are all worked up and everything
[1:14:07] all you're doing is causing that fear to
[1:14:10] continue the deterioration of the
[1:14:13] circumstance it will only make it worse
[1:14:15] and worse from then on you says place
[1:14:18] that fear has no virtue in it a fear
[1:14:22] will not help you fear fear is not but
[1:14:24] when you have faith faith can get you
[1:14:26] out of bed faith can save you faith says
[1:14:30] faith knows what the will and wants of
[1:14:32] God is Faith can change the circumstance
[1:14:36] faith can take something that is not and
[1:14:38] bring it into existence faith can come
[1:14:41] and take and says one place that faith
[1:14:43] can sign your
[1:14:50] pardon he says
[1:14:55] in the
[1:14:57] message the way to Fellowship paragraph
[1:15:00] 26 it
[1:15:02] says that's the
[1:15:06] trouble with men tonight paragraph
[1:15:13] 26 that's what's the trouble with people
[1:15:17] tonight we are
[1:15:23] scared that's the biggest
[1:15:26] curse there is on the Full Gospel people
[1:15:31] or any other is CA they are
[1:15:38] afraid God has made the
[1:15:41] provision God has made the provision but
[1:15:44] you are afraid to take him to take his
[1:15:48] word for
[1:15:49] it it
[1:15:51] says if you wasn't afraid tonight why he
[1:15:55] said you would take your healing by
[1:15:58] faith and know that God promised it and
[1:16:02] the thing will just go Plum away from
[1:16:05] you afraid scared it
[1:16:09] says I've noticed it and that's the
[1:16:13] reason I'm such a believer in healing it
[1:16:16] says I know that if you can get away
[1:16:20] from that
[1:16:21] scare and get love in in its place
[1:16:25] something is going to happen I like that
[1:16:28] he say he he tells you the way to
[1:16:31] Healing the way to the promises of God
[1:16:35] when when we come you know it's like if
[1:16:37] you afraid you don't even know how to
[1:16:39] ask when you afraid you you don't even
[1:16:41] know how to properly phrase your words
[1:16:43] in whatever you want to ask for why
[1:16:45] because you afraid if you know
[1:16:47] somebody's not going to give you
[1:16:49] something you're not going to have the
[1:16:50] courage to go ask him why because you
[1:16:53] are fear you're afraid of the rejection
[1:16:56] why because you afraid if I ask they're
[1:16:58] not going to give me but here he is it
[1:17:00] says what you need what we need as
[1:17:02] Believers is instead of having fear what
[1:17:05] we need to have in place is to have love
[1:17:08] replace that fear is to have love within
[1:17:10] our hearts and know that God will give
[1:17:13] it to us he continues on he says there's
[1:17:16] only two faculties that govern a
[1:17:19] human one of them is Faith which brings
[1:17:23] result and the other is fear
[1:17:25] which has no value in it at all faith is
[1:17:29] of god fear is of the devil Faith listen
[1:17:32] to this fear Makes You Weary fear makes
[1:17:36] you wonder and if you if you was go if
[1:17:39] you was going to die in the morning what
[1:17:42] good would he do would he do to me to
[1:17:45] get all uh uh uh uh stewed up uh uh uh
[1:17:49] stirred up stirred up about it what if I
[1:17:53] was going to be electrocuted in the
[1:17:56] morning he says my life has to end in
[1:17:59] the morning he says what would what what
[1:18:02] good would it do to me to be to worry
[1:18:04] about it it says well you say what good
[1:18:08] would would it would it do to have faith
[1:18:11] faith can sign my
[1:18:13] pardon sure that's the value in
[1:18:19] faith there's value in
[1:18:22] believing when when we hear the word of
[1:18:24] God the value behind faith is to know
[1:18:27] that there is someone there is the owner
[1:18:29] of that faith that you have when you
[1:18:32] believe you don't believe the words of a
[1:18:34] man you believe the words of a living
[1:18:36] God and that God is responsible for his
[1:18:39] own word he will come and make his word
[1:18:41] a reality to you the the the value in
[1:18:45] faith is if I believe faith will change
[1:18:47] the circumstances faith will come on the
[1:18:50] scene and he will bring about things
[1:18:52] that don't exist and faith will come and
[1:18:55] you will create a way faith will make
[1:18:57] sure that at the end the word of God has
[1:18:59] come to pass in your
[1:19:03] life don't be weary it says don't be
[1:19:06] scared don't be upset just have faith
[1:19:09] and believe and the only way you can
[1:19:11] have faith you have to have love
[1:19:14] first for love produces faith for for
[1:19:19] perfect love he says get it perfect love
[1:19:23] cast out fear
[1:19:27] amen
[1:19:30] amen in the message demonology of
[1:19:34] physical R uh par uh uh preaching 56 uh
[1:19:39] 53608 paragraph
[1:19:43] 80 but Ram says
[1:19:49] this well that's something that's the
[1:19:53] same thing that take place when a demon
[1:19:57] is cast out of a sick
[1:20:01] person it says for a few days oh I feel
[1:20:07] wonderful then begin to say I'm
[1:20:12] sicker I'm sicker than I ever
[1:20:21] was and he says I'm sicker than I ever
[1:20:25] was I've lost my
[1:20:28] healing it says just as sure as Faith
[1:20:33] took it out
[1:20:35] unbelief brings it right
[1:20:41] back I thought that is
[1:20:45] scary I just think about it you come and
[1:20:47] you get prayed for and you believe you
[1:20:49] said I'm Healed thank God and you go and
[1:20:52] and and and you feel very good and you
[1:20:54] feel and all of the sudden few days
[1:20:56] later that pain starts to come back and
[1:20:58] you said oh I don't know you know and
[1:21:01] the pain comes and he says perhaps
[1:21:03] greater than he was before and and just
[1:21:06] by you starting to say that I guess I
[1:21:10] was not heal you bringing it right back
[1:21:13] that's
[1:21:15] right if you could find it just put it
[1:21:17] out there
[1:21:20] please oh I feel
[1:21:23] wonderful then be tend to say I'm sicker
[1:21:26] than I than I ever
[1:21:30] was it says I've lost my
[1:21:35] healing just as sure as Faith took it
[1:21:38] out unbelief brings it right back
[1:21:42] again it says as Faith kills it unbelief
[1:21:47] resurrects
[1:21:50] it unbelief resurrects it Jesus said
[1:21:54] says when an unclean Spirit has gone out
[1:21:57] of a man he walketh in the dry places
[1:22:00] and returns back with seven other demons
[1:22:04] and if the good if the good man of the
[1:22:06] house uh isn't standing there uh to
[1:22:10] protect the home he will come right on
[1:22:13] it and the good man of the H uh the good
[1:22:16] man of your house is your faith say stay
[1:22:19] away that's right so it that's why
[1:22:22] everything in but but there's places
[1:22:25] where he says it's the same with
[1:22:27] salvation it's the same with everything
[1:22:29] if the moment you stop confessing that
[1:22:31] you are a Believer you go right back the
[1:22:34] moment you stop confessing so this
[1:22:37] positivity or or this faith is not we
[1:22:40] have faith today and we have that
[1:22:42] tomorrow no a Believer starts by faith
[1:22:45] and end by faith a Believer is one who
[1:22:48] holds on until the end a Believer is one
[1:22:51] who confesses every single day not just
[1:22:54] for two days not just for three days in
[1:22:57] the not just in the good time not just
[1:22:59] in every time whether it be good time
[1:23:01] bad times whatever the circumstances My
[1:23:03] Confession is I've been saved and God
[1:23:06] has saved my life and I'll continue to
[1:23:08] face uh to confess that until the day
[1:23:11] I'm taken out of the
[1:23:13] earth and that's how we walk so you
[1:23:15] never get to a point where because
[1:23:17] there's not going to be a time where
[1:23:19] Satan is going to give you a way in and
[1:23:21] say well you've confessed long enough
[1:23:23] and now I can leave you alone no it's
[1:23:25] confession upon confession it's
[1:23:27] confession today confession tomorrow
[1:23:30] regardless of the challenges is the
[1:23:32] continual confession it's the continual
[1:23:36] pushing of the fear out and continually
[1:23:38] standing on the word of God continually
[1:23:41] standing upon on faith that's what skips
[1:23:44] him
[1:23:46] away you you read places the very
[1:23:49] messenger who brought us this message
[1:23:51] you will say you know even in years like
[1:23:53] 63 3 6465 you'll say you know the other
[1:23:57] day the devil was talking to me and just
[1:23:59] telling me Oh nobody loves you and look
[1:24:02] at you and all of that and and he said
[1:24:04] then I'll remember meetings like this
[1:24:06] and tell him how about that
[1:24:08] time
[1:24:10] really out of all people I mean you
[1:24:13] would think you know he you just no it's
[1:24:16] made to be a continual fight every day
[1:24:20] it's made for us to continually confess
[1:24:22] to continually walk
[1:24:24] because the moment fear creps in faith
[1:24:27] is gone out you can't have fear and
[1:24:29] faith at the same
[1:24:32] time paragraph 31 he says but now you
[1:24:36] watch a patient that's healed and or
[1:24:39] ordinar he says lest in an outstanding
[1:24:42] Miracle it says which Divine Healing and
[1:24:45] a miracle is two different things Divine
[1:24:48] Healing is one thing and a miracle is
[1:24:50] another thing but an ordinary run of
[1:24:53] divine healing when an unclean
[1:24:56] Spirit un unclean spirit is cast out a
[1:25:00] cancer devil it says when he leaves a
[1:25:03] person oh it says now and say well I I
[1:25:06] I'll take something I'll take something
[1:25:09] so you can say you can see uh more
[1:25:13] visual it says I'll say the the Cataract
[1:25:16] it says what happened when that man if
[1:25:19] you notice a blind person I don't know
[1:25:22] uh it says whether I'll ever had uh uh
[1:25:26] whether I'll ever had any here or not
[1:25:29] yet the Cataract uh eye he says I'll let
[1:25:33] them stand for a few minutes why he says
[1:25:37] so that the the the shrinkage begin to
[1:25:40] take place tell them to come it says to
[1:25:43] come back give us a testimony and it
[1:25:46] says oh my they can they can see the
[1:25:50] wonderful they can see they can see
[1:25:52] wonderful oh my just as I can h i I can
[1:25:56] see things yes it says what's the matter
[1:25:59] life is gone out the body of the
[1:26:01] Cataract is shrinking well it'll it says
[1:26:05] it'll do that it'll do that way for a
[1:26:08] couple of days and oh I'm getting so
[1:26:11] well I'm getting so well so in other
[1:26:14] word this is where we the the the
[1:26:17] process is when when when the demon is
[1:26:20] cast out it's the life that goes out
[1:26:23] first the the the what the the the the
[1:26:27] the the other elements may still the
[1:26:29] growth may still there but the the the
[1:26:32] preaching of the word of the praying for
[1:26:33] the sick is to cast out demons so when
[1:26:36] the demon has gone out the growth may
[1:26:38] still there or whatever it is but as
[1:26:41] sure as God uh the word is preached when
[1:26:44] that demon is cast out whatever else
[1:26:46] happen after that it doesn't mean the
[1:26:49] healing was not there the healing
[1:26:51] process started when the demon is cast
[1:26:54] out so it's up to you to continue to
[1:26:56] believe and the growth will take place
[1:26:58] of itself so if you look at the growth
[1:27:01] and judge the the healing by the growth
[1:27:04] then you miss a
[1:27:07] point and so if the growth gets bigger
[1:27:10] it doesn't matter if the growth swells
[1:27:14] comes down that's wonderful but the
[1:27:16] regardless of what happened after that
[1:27:18] we know that the healing process as the
[1:27:21] prophet will say in other place that
[1:27:23] that the doctor will come and he will
[1:27:24] cut you open and he will do whatever and
[1:27:26] then he will Stitch you up but the
[1:27:28] healing process it says it's God that
[1:27:31] does it because it will heal back the
[1:27:33] wound and it's the flesh that heals
[1:27:35] itself and God heals it by the pro uhhh
[1:27:38] by his word because he promised that
[1:27:41] when he will do that he will come to
[1:27:42] healing but if you focus on the fact
[1:27:45] that it's bigger it's smaller it's this
[1:27:48] way it's that way that's how you
[1:27:50] determine your healing he's saying that
[1:27:52] if you do that you'll miss it
[1:28:01] in the
[1:28:09] message God projecting his
[1:28:13] love he he doesn't want
[1:28:17] us to operate by
[1:28:21] fear and I said it earlier
[1:28:25] I think if one would try to live a
[1:28:27] Christian Life by fear you will be the
[1:28:29] most miserable person there
[1:28:33] is if one will try to serve God just
[1:28:36] because we are afraid to go to hell
[1:28:39] that's not a healthy
[1:28:42] relationship if one will try to to to to
[1:28:48] serve or to do things just because you
[1:28:51] you want to do it by law and and and and
[1:28:54] I'll say this because it seems like if
[1:28:57] we're not careful we start to judge
[1:29:00] people by the measure of the
[1:29:04] law we we look at them are they dressing
[1:29:07] right are they talking right are they
[1:29:09] talking are they talking the message
[1:29:12] terminologies are they really doing this
[1:29:14] then then no it's not by that it's the
[1:29:16] love of God shed in the
[1:29:21] heart we we we look at people and and
[1:29:24] judge them one way or the other but if
[1:29:26] the relationship is by love then you
[1:29:29] begin to understand that if there's a
[1:29:31] lacking love will take care of
[1:29:35] it if there's something missing love is
[1:29:39] powerful enough to bring the
[1:29:44] fix butam will talk and will give an
[1:29:47] example evening about himself it says in
[1:29:51] the message God love projected uh God
[1:29:53] projecting his love preaching
[1:29:56] 57086 he says paragraph
[1:29:59] 14 he says love is a powerful
[1:30:04] force it said it would run a woman and a
[1:30:08] mother right into the flame of fire
[1:30:11] after her
[1:30:12] baby if she knows she's plunging herself
[1:30:16] into death there's nothing more stronger
[1:30:19] than love love will make you trust
[1:30:24] amen you might
[1:30:27] go and know that you
[1:30:31] belong to the greatest
[1:30:34] Church in all the provinces of Canada
[1:30:38] you might know that you are a charact a
[1:30:41] a a character member of the greatest
[1:30:44] Church in the
[1:30:45] nation then you will do things that you
[1:30:50] wouldn't do if you belong to a little
[1:30:53] mission somewhere if some in some corner
[1:30:57] and had the love of God in your heart
[1:31:00] love has no fear love casts out fear and
[1:31:05] I noticed in my meetings they said so
[1:31:08] many that so many so much that when I
[1:31:12] come into the into the people and it
[1:31:14] says one of the greatest thing I find
[1:31:17] among them is fear and it says and what
[1:31:20] makes fear is the lack of confidence if
[1:31:23] if you lack confidence it will make you
[1:31:26] fear and if you if you love it castes
[1:31:30] out it cast out it Cast Away that fear
[1:31:34] and it castes it castes away it says and
[1:31:37] that's the way God wants his church not
[1:31:40] so many not so many as character member
[1:31:45] he wants member that's loyal and loves
[1:31:49] and believes and has confidence in him
[1:31:57] now remember this is the same Prophet
[1:31:59] who said that if I will serve him all my
[1:32:04] life and I get to the end and he looks
[1:32:08] at me he says hypocrite It cast me away
[1:32:12] and it kicks me down into
[1:32:14] hell it said I'll still love
[1:32:22] him because by love there's
[1:32:26] Freedom there's rejoicing there's
[1:32:29] confidence there's you know that there's
[1:32:32] no other motives behind love if if if
[1:32:35] something is done with the motive of
[1:32:37] Love behind it it will produce the
[1:32:40] result but if it's done something is
[1:32:42] done in fear When You observe it you
[1:32:45] will always see the element that there's
[1:32:47] fear in it there you always see
[1:32:49] something that doesn't seem to be right
[1:32:51] but if it's done by love all the
[1:32:53] confidence is in it paragraph 15 it says
[1:32:57] for instance my wife if it says my wife
[1:33:00] is somewhere in the meetings tonight in
[1:33:02] the audience I love her with all my
[1:33:04] heart and when I get ready to go
[1:33:06] overseas now and says and if my wife if
[1:33:10] it says and if my wife I caught her by
[1:33:12] the arm and said listen here M Mrs
[1:33:15] brandham it says while I'm gone overseas
[1:33:19] thou shall not have any more husband it
[1:33:22] says and if I ever hear
[1:33:24] uh uh of you flirting with another with
[1:33:27] another man while I'm gone woe unto you
[1:33:30] when I get back and then it says and and
[1:33:33] then if she will catch me by the by the
[1:33:37] court collar and say uh it says that's
[1:33:41] that's very well Mr
[1:33:43] brandham it says but I want you to I
[1:33:46] want you to have a little law to he says
[1:33:49] if you if I hear of you going out with
[1:33:52] another woman go unto you when you come
[1:33:55] back it says now wouldn't that be a home
[1:33:59] well that's just about the way we made
[1:34:02] God's place of dwelling a dwelling some
[1:34:05] kind of legalistic law that we have to
[1:34:14] keep what does this
[1:34:17] fear lack of
[1:34:20] trust lack of confidence
[1:34:24] lack that God is going to take care of
[1:34:27] me lack that oh if I do this if I do
[1:34:31] this God is going to punish me no God is
[1:34:34] not interested in a robot God made you a
[1:34:37] free moral agend and he saves you so you
[1:34:41] can from the bottom of your heart serve
[1:34:44] him and say I'm serving him because I'm
[1:34:47] thankful not because I'm fearful so when
[1:34:50] we get there when we praise him it has
[1:34:53] to be like a sincere praise to say that
[1:34:56] I'm just thankful there's nothing more
[1:34:58] here except I'm
[1:35:09] thankful it
[1:35:12] says what do I do when I go overseas I
[1:35:16] love my wife and as long as As I love
[1:35:19] her it says I got confidence in her it
[1:35:22] says we just got we just get down in the
[1:35:24] floor and pray together and bring our
[1:35:27] little children around us they pray God
[1:35:30] take care of daddy uh God take care of
[1:35:32] daddy uh bring him back I pray God take
[1:35:35] care of my family while I'm gone I raise
[1:35:38] up kisser goodbye and kiss the babies it
[1:35:41] says and then she said Billy I'll pray
[1:35:43] for you while you are gone it says that
[1:35:46] settles it we think no more about it it
[1:35:49] says now it says and if uh if and and if
[1:35:53] I was overseas under the
[1:35:55] law I know I'll be divorced when I get
[1:36:00] back and if I went out with some uh
[1:36:03] someone else's someone else's it says
[1:36:06] and I'll be a miserable man but if I was
[1:36:09] over there it says no matter what kind
[1:36:11] of condition I was in and I knew that I
[1:36:15] could cheat on her and came back and
[1:36:17] tell
[1:36:19] her and I knew that I could cheat on her
[1:36:23] and came back back and tell her and she
[1:36:25] would forgive me for it I still wouldn't
[1:36:28] do it I wouldn't hurt her for nothing no
[1:36:33] sir if I know she will say Bill I
[1:36:36] understand I forgive you I couldn't look
[1:36:39] her in the face I think that's too much
[1:36:42] for
[1:36:43] her that that's the that's the heart of
[1:36:46] a Believer that's the heart of one who
[1:36:48] love is not doing it let me say this
[1:36:51] even if you know they're going to
[1:36:52] forgive you but because of the love that
[1:36:54] fled your heart you wouldn't do
[1:36:59] it that that's how God wants us to
[1:37:02] worship him he doesn't want us be bound
[1:37:04] by fear oh if I do this I'm going to
[1:37:07] look weird if I do this Bound by
[1:37:09] boundaries and I cannot do this I no God
[1:37:12] wants us to be free he wants us to
[1:37:14] worship him he wants us to serve him
[1:37:17] when he speaks to your heart you move
[1:37:18] quickly when he says this you do it why
[1:37:21] because I don't have fear I have love
[1:37:23] love within my heart I'm not doing it
[1:37:25] because I'm afraid I'm doing it because
[1:37:28] the hearts is beating with love I love
[1:37:31] God I want to serve him I want to please
[1:37:34] him I'm doing this because of what he's
[1:37:36] done for me he could have made me an
[1:37:38] animal but he made me a
[1:37:44] human oh I think about David it said one
[1:37:48] place it said
[1:37:50] that oh I believe in Psalm somewhere he
[1:37:54] said that you can have this lips and he
[1:37:58] said you could take this body and put it
[1:38:00] in the casket it said but but if you put
[1:38:04] me there it says those lips will be shut
[1:38:06] off who's going to worship you why
[1:38:09] because David knew that what I'm alive
[1:38:11] what God has given me a breath I will
[1:38:14] use every breath that he given me to
[1:38:16] praise him he knew that this lips will
[1:38:19] praise him he knew that this body will
[1:38:21] be put at his work so one thing he knew
[1:38:23] that if I could do that God will be
[1:38:26] pleased with it
[1:38:28] yes he wasn't doing it by
[1:38:32] law it
[1:38:35] says I think I'm still in the same
[1:38:37] message it
[1:38:38] says I tell you brother when the love of
[1:38:42] God comes into the human heart now this
[1:38:48] is not the human love and the human
[1:38:51] understand when the true love of God
[1:38:53] comes into the human's heart it will
[1:38:56] drive all those things it will drive all
[1:39:00] these things it says you don't have to
[1:39:03] worry about smoking drinking running to
[1:39:06] the uh uh uh uh by bioscope and it says
[1:39:11] when the love when when the love of
[1:39:13] Christ come into your heart you wouldn't
[1:39:16] do nothing to hurt
[1:39:20] him not walking around saying uh there
[1:39:24] narrow minded and and and and they are
[1:39:27] this way they are that way just let the
[1:39:30] love of God strike you once those things
[1:39:34] those things die the whole it says your
[1:39:37] whole affle your whole affection places
[1:39:40] on Christ you got eternal life then when
[1:39:43] you it says when you believe in him when
[1:39:46] you really believe in him get married to
[1:39:48] him and die out to the things of the
[1:39:51] world God he says God God project his
[1:39:55] love and his love makes you what you are
[1:39:59] oh there's many things that you could
[1:40:02] say about it it's just going to tell it
[1:40:05] says it's going to tell my my colar down
[1:40:08] it was it says for a few minutes tell
[1:40:10] you it says my Canadian friends and some
[1:40:13] of the inside it says if you just excuse
[1:40:16] me the personal testimony I want to let
[1:40:19] you know something that something on the
[1:40:21] inside of my life that I Focus because
[1:40:24] it seems very fitting right in the in
[1:40:27] this time many people wonder what takes
[1:40:30] place it says think it's some sort of uh
[1:40:34] uh of a Mystic is it it it isn't it's
[1:40:37] love it says there the main thing is
[1:40:40] love loving Christ not just saying uh uh
[1:40:44] you do but from from the hearts of God
[1:40:49] uh from your heart love him it says you
[1:40:52] seen the
[1:40:53] devil conquer see the the wild animal
[1:40:57] flow themselves in the presence of love
[1:41:00] love castes the fear
[1:41:06] away but when I'm talks
[1:41:09] about
[1:41:11] the bull and he talks about the
[1:41:15] bees I think about the bull he talks
[1:41:18] about he said he was supposed to go and
[1:41:21] he wanted to go with his gun the thing
[1:41:23] is he forgot his gun in the process and
[1:41:26] once he saw the bull he tried to reach
[1:41:28] out for his gun and realized he didn't
[1:41:30] have
[1:41:32] it think about
[1:41:35] it and he had nothing to rely on except
[1:41:39] the love and When Love Was projected it
[1:41:43] changed the
[1:41:47] circumstance the scripture
[1:41:50] says about fear in Isaiah 41 and 10 it
[1:41:54] says fear thou not for I am with thee be
[1:41:59] not dismayed for I am thy God I will
[1:42:02] strengthen thee yeah I will help thee
[1:42:05] yeah I will uphold thee with the right
[1:42:09] hand of my
[1:42:12] righteousness in Hebrews 13 and5 if you
[1:42:16] could put that
[1:42:18] up he
[1:42:20] says let your conversation
[1:42:23] be without
[1:42:25] covetousness and be content with such
[1:42:29] things that ye have for ye for he has
[1:42:32] said I will never leave thee never
[1:42:35] forsake thee so that we may boldly say
[1:42:41] the Lord is my
[1:42:43] helper and I will not fear what men
[1:42:46] shall do unto me that's the confidence
[1:42:49] he want us to have the confidence in in
[1:42:52] his promise in what he says in what he
[1:42:55] promised in the things that he said he
[1:42:57] will do he says remember them which have
[1:42:59] ruled over you who has spoken unto you
[1:43:03] the word of God whose Faith followed
[1:43:06] considering the end of your uh of your
[1:43:09] salvation Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:11] yesterday today and forever in second
[1:43:14] Timothy chapter 6 it says
[1:43:18] wherefore I put thee in remembrance that
[1:43:21] thou steare up the gift of God which is
[1:43:25] in the by the putting
[1:43:29] on of my hands it says for God I like
[1:43:33] this it says in verse seven it says for
[1:43:37] God had not given us the spirit of fear
[1:43:42] but of power of love and of sound
[1:43:46] mind so this is one thing we have as
[1:43:50] Believers when we are born again of the
[1:43:52] SP spirit of God the Bible tells us that
[1:43:55] the spirit that we have received is not
[1:43:58] the spirit of fear it's not to worship
[1:44:00] God in fear is not to approach God In
[1:44:03] Fear he wants us to have the spirit of
[1:44:06] power the spirit of love the spirit of
[1:44:09] sound mind to have the power of God
[1:44:12] within us to know that I have been born
[1:44:14] again by the spirit of God the spirit in
[1:44:17] fact it says the spirit that we have
[1:44:19] received is the spirit of adoption is is
[1:44:22] the spirit that cth ABA father and know
[1:44:25] that I'm forgiven is the spirit that
[1:44:28] gives us the confidence to know that we
[1:44:30] have access to God that we can come to
[1:44:32] God and ask what we have need of is the
[1:44:35] spirit to know that no matter what he
[1:44:37] will not leave me is the spirit to know
[1:44:40] that the power of God will be manifested
[1:44:42] in my life because I believe his
[1:44:47] word but if we approach him by fear then
[1:44:51] we wouldn't get access to what it desire
[1:44:53] for us to get access
[1:44:55] to and so this word of God as we read
[1:44:59] the scripture says I like the scripture
[1:45:02] in Ezekiel 36 and22 and it speaks and
[1:45:05] says therefore say unto the house of
[1:45:10] Israel th sayth the Lord God I do I says
[1:45:15] I do this not for your sake oh House of
[1:45:18] Israel for but for mine Holy Name sake
[1:45:22] which ye have Pro profan among the
[1:45:24] Heathen where ye went now I want you to
[1:45:27] just to think about what the word of God
[1:45:29] is saying it
[1:45:31] says uh it says and I will
[1:45:35] sanctify I will sanctify my great name
[1:45:38] which was profane Among the Hidden when
[1:45:43] ye have profaned in the midst of them
[1:45:46] and the hidden shall know that I am the
[1:45:49] Lord that I am the Lord sayith the Lord
[1:45:52] God when I shall be Sanctified in before
[1:45:55] their eyes it says I will take you from
[1:45:59] among the Heathen and gather you out of
[1:46:02] the countries and bring you into your
[1:46:04] own land it says then I will sprinkle
[1:46:08] clean water upon you and I shall and ye
[1:46:11] shall be clean for your uh from your
[1:46:14] filthiness and from all your Idols I
[1:46:18] will clean you it says a a new heart
[1:46:22] also also will I give you and the new
[1:46:26] spirit will I put in you I will take
[1:46:29] away your Stony heart and will give you
[1:46:32] and and out of you it says the Stony
[1:46:36] heart out of your flesh and will give
[1:46:38] you a heart of Flesh and I will put my
[1:46:41] spirit within you and will cause you to
[1:46:44] walk in my statue and ye shall keep my
[1:46:48] judgment and to do them and ye shall
[1:46:51] dwell in the land I have given you I
[1:46:54] have given your fathers and ye shall be
[1:46:57] my people and I will be your God so when
[1:47:00] we become a Christian as a Christian
[1:47:03] here is the testimony of the word of God
[1:47:05] to the believer I am the Lord God that
[1:47:08] does this I'm the one who brought you
[1:47:10] out of the Eden it says that when you
[1:47:12] were part of the heeden you profane my
[1:47:15] name you said all kind of things
[1:47:17] belonging to my name and you you you
[1:47:19] blashe according to my name and all
[1:47:21] those things but I will bring you out of
[1:47:24] those people and I will set you up to be
[1:47:26] a people according to my name and out of
[1:47:29] you because of my name's sake I will
[1:47:32] take the Stony out out of you I will put
[1:47:34] a new Hearts within you and I will take
[1:47:37] my spirit and put inside of you and you
[1:47:40] will obey my word that's what a
[1:47:42] Christian
[1:47:47] is I I think the challenge is when we
[1:47:51] approach God and we come in by
[1:47:54] intellect because it's by the way of
[1:47:57] Flesh the element of fear will always be
[1:48:01] there did I do right today how how much
[1:48:05] right versus wrong did I do today did I
[1:48:09] do as much right as I did wrong or if I
[1:48:12] did a lot a lot more right than I did
[1:48:14] wrong thank
[1:48:16] God let me try to do tomorrow more
[1:48:19] rights than I did
[1:48:21] wrong we don't desire
[1:48:24] that in fact when our flesh trips us we
[1:48:28] we go to our knees we said Lord I I
[1:48:31] didn't mean to do that and as we say it
[1:48:33] he already knows I know you didn't mean
[1:48:36] to do that I know you didn't mean I know
[1:48:39] your heart is pure why because I took
[1:48:41] away your Stony heart I gave you a heart
[1:48:43] of Flesh Lord I I the the scripture says
[1:48:46] that even the very spirit inced for us
[1:48:50] word that cannot be author by the mouth
[1:48:52] before we can even speak it we have a
[1:48:54] such a connection with him that before
[1:48:56] we can even speak it he knows
[1:49:00] already I know you you didn't mean to
[1:49:03] say that you didn't mean to do that I I
[1:49:06] understand that you stand up you go
[1:49:08] forward and then next day we stand and
[1:49:11] we have such a boldness and we stand why
[1:49:13] because our hearts has been made pure
[1:49:17] our spirit is not longer our spirit is
[1:49:19] his spirit in us that's causing us to
[1:49:22] live that way
[1:49:32] what Ram speaks
[1:49:37] about this woman this is in the message
[1:49:40] the 20th century prophet and I thought
[1:49:43] it
[1:49:45] was so
[1:49:48] powerful and this is in a prayer line
[1:49:54] and this this woman comes before him and
[1:49:56] he looks at her and says paragraph 18 it
[1:50:00] says excuse me
[1:50:03] sister he says you have to relax it says
[1:50:06] you have to relax my mind once in a
[1:50:09] while now you'll be a
[1:50:12] stranger I see that you
[1:50:15] are strictly a stranger to me you are
[1:50:19] from a way from uh you are from a away
[1:50:23] from
[1:50:24] here you've come from another
[1:50:28] city you've got a lot of trouble in your
[1:50:31] heart and you've got a lot of trouble to
[1:50:34] begin with is that right there's a lot
[1:50:37] of Blackness he
[1:50:40] says I see a black sheep keep following
[1:50:44] you like that oh it's a
[1:50:49] lie somebody's told a lie on
[1:50:55] you and not was if somebody's told a lie
[1:50:59] on you and not was a man was professing
[1:51:03] Divine
[1:51:04] Healing the sister says yes he
[1:51:08] said you was it says he said you was a
[1:51:11] witch yes is that true and you got the
[1:51:16] you got all stirred up you got you got
[1:51:19] the whole stirred in your church
[1:51:23] and something another about it isn't
[1:51:26] that right your pastor's sick right
[1:51:30] now he got polio is that right sister
[1:51:34] don't pay no more attention to what that
[1:51:37] man that them people say to you tell you
[1:51:40] they are a
[1:51:42] liar and the only thing that's wrong
[1:51:45] with your heart is that nervousness
[1:51:48] condition go your heart it says you got
[1:51:52] your the nervousness condition got your
[1:51:54] heart worked up go it says go home in
[1:51:57] peace and God bless
[1:52:00] you so this is a
[1:52:02] person that somebody told a lie on them
[1:52:06] and all of the sudden it messed up the
[1:52:09] entire
[1:52:15] life somebody told something that was
[1:52:18] not true about them think about it
[1:52:23] and the whole
[1:52:26] life the heart condition and things
[1:52:30] happening this left and right all of
[1:52:33] that build Upon A Lie what happened the
[1:52:36] LIE caused the fear and the fear
[1:52:40] produced the
[1:52:45] result and I thought how many of us are
[1:52:48] living lives based on lies that the
[1:52:51] devil is told
[1:52:54] us how many of us walk around oh I'm no
[1:52:57] good and I'm not this so I can never do
[1:53:00] right and I can never succeed at this
[1:53:02] all of that because of some teacher
[1:53:05] somebody somewhere looked at you and
[1:53:07] says oh you never be succeed to anything
[1:53:10] oh you never good at this you will never
[1:53:12] be good at this oh you lacked such and
[1:53:14] such and you don't have this Talent you
[1:53:16] don't have that talent and all of the
[1:53:18] sudden we frame our entire life based on
[1:53:22] what one person said or based on what
[1:53:25] two people said we take that and we
[1:53:28] build that as the foundation of our
[1:53:30] whole
[1:53:37] life that's what the word of God does it
[1:53:39] comes to break the LIE of the
[1:53:43] devil the devil calls you a sinner the
[1:53:45] word says you are a son of God the devil
[1:53:48] calls you you are no good the word of
[1:53:50] God said you were predestinated to be
[1:53:52] good
[1:53:53] the devil says you are this the word of
[1:53:54] God said that the problem is you have to
[1:53:57] stop believing the LIE am you got to
[1:53:59] come to a place where you call a lie a
[1:54:01] lie you cannot believe a lie today and
[1:54:04] try to set no it's a lie anything that
[1:54:07] the devil tells you it's a
[1:54:10] lie anything that doesn't come from the
[1:54:13] word of God is a lie if you tell me I'm
[1:54:16] no good oh I just got to Rejoice then
[1:54:18] and know because you said it that means
[1:54:21] I must be good amen oh you are a sinner
[1:54:24] praise God I must be saved why because
[1:54:28] it's not man that determines who you are
[1:54:30] it's not the devil that determines who
[1:54:32] you are it's God who determines who you
[1:54:41] are I like this the prophet now he's
[1:54:45] speaking about uh job I believe he he's
[1:54:49] talking about job and oh I love this he
[1:54:52] talks about job being in the
[1:54:53] circumstance that I'm sorry not job
[1:54:56] Jonah being in the circumstance that he
[1:54:58] was in we know that he was uh uh uh uh
[1:55:01] uh sent to go preach uh uh the the word
[1:55:04] of God and he went and he he went a
[1:55:06] different direction and we understand he
[1:55:08] was swallowed up by the the the fish and
[1:55:10] and everything but when picks it up in
[1:55:12] the message signs of the end time
[1:55:14] paragraph 132 and it says this it says
[1:55:18] now we are it says we are always it's
[1:55:20] too bad and but we we always try to
[1:55:23] think and show oh Satan showing us our
[1:55:26] symptoms he says well you see you you
[1:55:29] you are not any better than this and it
[1:55:31] was yesterday see you are no better
[1:55:35] don't look at the symptoms he says andam
[1:55:38] says this paragraph 133 says and if
[1:55:41] anybody could have a any symptom it says
[1:55:45] it would have been
[1:55:46] Jonah says he says anywhere he looked
[1:55:51] there was the be Well's belly see but
[1:55:54] you look to what he says he says there
[1:55:56] was lying vanity in other words Jonah is
[1:56:00] looking at all the symptoms and he
[1:56:02] saying that they are lying vanity he
[1:56:05] says he never said I'm going to look at
[1:56:08] this and says once more he said once
[1:56:11] more I will look to your Holy Temple he
[1:56:15] says for he knew when Solomon prayed and
[1:56:19] dedicated the temple he said that if th
[1:56:22] people be in trouble anywhere and look
[1:56:25] to this holy place and pray then hear
[1:56:29] from Heaven he W he had confidence in
[1:56:32] Solomon's Prayer a man and Earthly man
[1:56:35] like you and I and then he says and he
[1:56:38] after after a while even backslide woman
[1:56:42] drawn him away from God and then it says
[1:56:45] but he prayed H he his prayer was heard
[1:56:49] from God and he could have faith under
[1:56:52] under them circumstances now brother
[1:56:55] says this then how much more faith are
[1:56:57] we to have when we don't look to the
[1:57:01] temple by built by man but but our
[1:57:04] Heavenly but our Heavenly itself when
[1:57:07] the Son of God sits on the right hand of
[1:57:10] God of his majesty with his own blood he
[1:57:13] says ever living making interception he
[1:57:17] says there's one there's there's there's
[1:57:19] none of us it says there's none of us
[1:57:22] has that kind of symptom like that we it
[1:57:25] says we see people heal in the presence
[1:57:28] of God all the time well we should never
[1:57:31] look at the symptoms that they are lying
[1:57:33] vanity look to God it says that's what
[1:57:37] that's who made the promise so here we
[1:57:40] are and it's talking about this so it's
[1:57:42] important as we hear the word of God the
[1:57:45] fear that now he could have had fear and
[1:57:48] said that oh I'm in the Well's belly but
[1:57:51] says one place he says you know when he
[1:57:53] was swallowed as any fish when he
[1:57:55] swallowed up a person he goes all the
[1:57:58] way to the Bottom of the Sea he doesn't
[1:58:00] even stay somewhere where you could say
[1:58:02] well if I move long enough it's going to
[1:58:04] take off no he went all the way to the
[1:58:07] Bottom of the Sea and all the way he
[1:58:09] looked all he could see was the the
[1:58:12] belly of the well but he remembered that
[1:58:14] there was a promise in the Bible that
[1:58:17] God when he told Solomon that out of
[1:58:19] this Holy Temple that if anybody will
[1:58:21] pray looking at this Temple I will hear
[1:58:24] the promise and I will remember my word
[1:58:26] and I will come to them now remember he
[1:58:28] says this one place the prophet said now
[1:58:31] this is a backsliding prophet praying
[1:58:34] the prayer of one who was a king who
[1:58:36] backslid it but God was obligated to
[1:58:39] hear because it was according to the
[1:58:41] promise that he made but yet we all Sons
[1:58:43] and Daughters of God we praying looking
[1:58:46] to Calvary which is a finished work that
[1:58:49] God has done a work that can never be
[1:58:51] changed
[1:58:58] but if we have
[1:59:00] fear we wouldn't do that you could have
[1:59:04] looked and say well I might as well give
[1:59:07] up I'm going to die this is the end of
[1:59:10] me and just lay there and wait till they
[1:59:14] die but he had faith that if I could
[1:59:18] only pray that God will hear the prayer
[1:59:23] because when the temple was dedicated
[1:59:25] God made a promise that if you will look
[1:59:27] to that Temple Holy Temple and pray that
[1:59:30] God will
[1:59:31] hear and I want to say this today this
[1:59:34] tonight let's not look at the symptoms
[1:59:36] let's not look at fear let's look at the
[1:59:39] promise that God has made us when we
[1:59:42] look at the promise we shall live when
[1:59:44] we look at the symptoms we will create
[1:59:46] fear we shall
[1:59:48] die if the musician could come
[1:59:55] butam says in the message the greatest
[1:59:57] battle ever fought paragraph
[2:00:00] 111
[2:00:03] see it's your mind that opens up the
[2:00:07] door or closes the
[2:00:10] door and listens to your conscience
[2:00:13] listens to your
[2:00:15] memory listens to your
[2:00:18] affection but when your
[2:00:20] mind closes it itself to those things
[2:00:25] and let God the spirit of his word come
[2:00:28] in it blows the rest of the stuff
[2:00:33] out I said that's what I
[2:00:37] want I want my
[2:00:39] mind to close itself to
[2:00:43] everything and only allow the spirit of
[2:00:46] his word come in it blows the rest of
[2:00:49] the stuff out every doubt is gone
[2:00:52] every fear is gone every sensation of
[2:00:56] Doubt is gone every feeling is gone
[2:00:59] there's nothing standing there but the
[2:01:02] word of God and Satan cannot battle
[2:01:05] against that no sir he cannot battle
[2:01:09] against it no we know that's
[2:01:16] true I said that's what I want tonight
[2:01:18] Lord let's all stand father I want want
[2:01:22] to shut off every time I hear the word
[2:01:24] and I see all the mountains of evidence
[2:01:27] of of what I cannot do and of fear of oh
[2:01:31] of fear of failure fear of this and fear
[2:01:34] of that and fear I I see all of
[2:01:38] that I say okay but I'm going to believe
[2:01:42] right now and let the spirit of the word
[2:01:45] come in and I'm going to shut off and
[2:01:48] let the word of God produce the result
[2:01:50] of what he promised it would do why
[2:01:52] because he's a faithful God what he said
[2:01:55] he will do he will do it why because as
[2:01:58] we read the the scripture he said
[2:02:01] that though I walk in the valley of
[2:02:03] shadow of death I will not fear thou are
[2:02:07] with me though whatever though the Earth
[2:02:10] be moved though the mountains be thrown
[2:02:13] in the sea I will stand I will not fear
[2:02:16] why because if I walk by fear I might as
[2:02:18] well forget it it will not produce
[2:02:20] anything it will only lead me astray but
[2:02:23] if I walk by faith if I stand in in love
[2:02:27] and faith it will produce what God
[2:02:29] promise it will produce our gracious
[2:02:32] father we're so thankful Lord
[2:02:34] and father we want to just commit
[2:02:36] ourselves to you Lord
[2:02:38] and father as Believers of your
[2:02:43] word Lord God one thing we want to do is
[2:02:45] to operate by faith and not by fear
[2:02:50] Lord Lord when we go home when we go to
[2:02:54] work
[2:02:55] and on our daily lives Lord every time
[2:03:03] and father we are in campus such about a
[2:03:06] lot of things
