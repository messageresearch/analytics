[30:26] we're all here by his grace tonight
[30:28] let's just bear our heads
[30:31] creates a heavenly father or
[30:36] so thankful
[30:42] that the blood of Jesus Christ was shed
[30:44] from me
[30:47] and that you redeem me Lord Jesus
[30:51] what a Grace Lord Jesus
[30:54] there's not enough words that we could
[30:56] all sit here and just talk about your
[30:59] goodness and your grace Upon Our Life
[31:00] [Music]
[31:02] how you let us Lord
[31:04] how you walked with us Lord
[31:06] how you just show us every day that
[31:10] you're always with us and you'll never
[31:11] leave us
[31:12] because Lord you chose the bride
[31:15] and you always had your eye on her
[31:18] because she used to be without spot a
[31:21] wrinkle and Lord we're just so grateful
[31:24] for your word
[31:26] I pray Lord tonight that you
[31:30] Lord you help me move out of the way I'm
[31:33] maybe a little nervous
[31:39] but I asked Lord that
[31:41] you would have your way
[31:44] Lord It's Your word it's not my words
[31:46] there's nothing that I could come up
[31:48] with Lord but it's just your word and so
[31:50] Lord I pray that
[31:52] you bless us tonight
[31:54] Lord that you would have your way that
[31:56] you would come and dine with us Lord it
[31:58] Lord we just welcome you in our midst
[32:00] tonight
[32:01] Lord we ask Lord that you would have
[32:04] and come and dine with us Lord and just
[32:07] show us your love once again
[32:10] it's by that love that we know you Lord
[32:12] Jesus
[32:14] we commit the rest of the service into
[32:16] your hands and know that
[32:18] everything that we have belongs to you
[32:21] we just leave it all into your hands now
[32:23] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[32:25] Christ we pray
[32:30] and to the house the Lord
[32:33] let's just turn to our scripture here
[32:35] we're going to read in Matthew 25.
[32:37] verse 10.
[32:40] and then we're going to go to
[32:41] Revelations 22.
[32:46] pray you're excited to be in the house
[32:49] of the Lord
[32:51] it's always
[32:52] good to be with our precious brothers
[32:54] and sisters like faith and
[32:57] just to know that we're a fellowship and
[32:59] around him
[33:09] and while they went to buy the
[33:12] bridegroom came
[33:14] and they that were ready went in with
[33:17] them to the marriage
[33:18] and the door was shut
[33:21] and let's also turned to Revelations 22
[33:30] verses 7 to 12.
[33:43] it says behold I come quickly
[33:48] blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
[33:50] of the prophecy of this book
[33:53] and I John saw these things and heard
[33:56] them
[33:57] and when I had heard them and seen I
[34:00] fell down to worship before the feet of
[34:02] the Angel which showed me these things
[34:06] then Jesus saith unto him and then then
[34:09] saith he unto me
[34:11] see thou do it not for I am thy fellow
[34:15] servant
[34:18] and of thy Brethren the prophets and of
[34:22] them which keep the sayings of this book
[34:25] worship God
[34:28] and he said unto me seal not the sayings
[34:31] of the prophecy of this book
[34:34] for the time is at hand
[34:37] he that is unjust let him be unjust and
[34:41] he that is filthy let him be filthy
[34:43] still
[34:45] I want to concentrate on this next
[34:46] portion of the verse
[34:48] and he that is righteous
[34:50] let him be righteous still
[34:53] and he that is Holy let him be holy
[34:56] still
[34:57] behold I come quickly
[35:00] and my reward is with me
[35:03] to every man according to his work
[35:08] according as his work shall be amen we
[35:12] just ask a blessing over the reading of
[35:13] the word God bless you you can just
[35:15] have your seats
[35:17] and so
[35:19] I'm just blessed to be in the house of
[35:21] the Lord tonight I if you can just pray
[35:23] for me I'm a little nervous
[35:25] and I'm just gonna
[35:28] obey the Lord and just follow his
[35:30] leadership and and just see where he
[35:32] takes us tonight but you know the Lord
[35:34] just gave me a few scriptures and a
[35:36] quote a few quotes on my heart for
[35:38] tonight and so
[35:40] um
[35:41] I want to talk about the righteous and
[35:43] holy reward
[35:46] there's a righteous and a holy reward
[35:49] and there's a way that we obtain that
[35:52] righteous and holy reward
[35:54] and sometimes we take a scripture and we
[35:58] may look at the negative let them that
[36:00] be filthy be filthy still but let them
[36:02] be filthy
[36:03] because we receive something that gets
[36:05] us to be righteous
[36:06] there's a message that came in this
[36:08] generation that we can be righteous we
[36:10] can be holy we can be washed by the
[36:12] blood of Jesus Christ
[36:13] and there's a union now that's happening
[36:16] between the word and the bride
[36:18] and this is not just a union between the
[36:20] groom and the bride but it also produces
[36:22] a cleansing to the bride because she
[36:26] must be without spot or wrinkle
[36:31] I was just looking into
[36:34] I know sometimes it's hard when you go
[36:36] on the internet and you type up
[36:37] what's the percentage of divorce these
[36:39] days
[36:41] you know my marriage is a very wonderful
[36:43] thing it's a very wonderful Covenant
[36:45] that the Lord made
[36:46] but the internet said that 60 of
[36:48] marriages in 2023 ended up in divorce
[36:53] there is a million 900 something worth
[36:55] of marriages that happened every year
[36:57] and 60 percent of them
[37:01] end up in a divorce
[37:03] and so you realize how the devil even
[37:06] tries to attack the natural way of a
[37:10] marriage between a a a a man and a woman
[37:14] trying to unsettle them and take them
[37:15] away from even a simple Covenant of a
[37:18] marriage between a man and a woman
[37:20] how much more will he try to deceive or
[37:23] try to come and and pervert or maybe
[37:26] even deceive the very bride of Jesus
[37:28] Christ but we know
[37:30] that his word is righteous
[37:32] we know that his word is Holy and as we
[37:36] apply this word to our life
[37:39] now
[37:40] who are changing the image of what we
[37:43] are
[37:45] you know marriage is a wonderful thing
[37:49] you know I
[37:51] you can you can reflect the people that
[37:54] are married the Believers that are
[37:56] married tonight but you know it's it's a
[37:58] it's a decision that you make that you
[38:00] know you have to live with the rest of
[38:02] your life
[38:05] it's something that you have to be sure
[38:07] about
[38:08] because
[38:10] now
[38:12] you become one
[38:14] in pain and suffering
[38:16] in good and bad and up and down there's
[38:20] a lot of things that now we're uniting
[38:22] when we when we marry our loved one
[38:26] marriage is intimate
[38:30] marriage is love
[38:32] marriage is also a union between the
[38:35] bridegroom and the bride
[38:38] and verse 12 in Revelations 22 says and
[38:42] behold I come quickly and my reward is
[38:45] with me to give every man according to
[38:48] his work shall be brother Branham says
[38:51] this and humble thyself
[38:52] he says Across the Nation will come
[38:54] those who are dead in Christ will rise
[38:57] first
[38:58] we believe for a rapture says the
[39:01] Rapture will take place
[39:03] the church will be taken home and then
[39:06] the tribulation was set in it says oh my
[39:09] we don't want to be here during that
[39:12] time
[39:13] I don't want to be here in the
[39:15] tribulation no God forbid that any of us
[39:18] would be here during that time because
[39:21] he says he that is filled to be filthy
[39:24] still and he that is Holy be holy still
[39:27] and he that is righteous be righteous
[39:30] still
[39:31] to know the lamb had come forth with his
[39:35] book of redemption and the bride has to
[39:38] be taken out
[39:40] and those who turned it down has to go
[39:43] through the tribulation period both Jews
[39:45] and Gentiles what a time of tribulation
[39:47] I don't want to do that Lord
[39:50] sanctify me now
[39:53] that's a good Nazarene Doctrine and it's
[39:55] the truth it's true that's right it says
[39:58] fill me now with your Holy Spirit Lord
[40:01] take all the word out of me now Lord it
[40:05] says as an old color brother said I got
[40:09] my ticket in my hand
[40:12] it's already punched
[40:14] and when I come down to the river that
[40:16] morning I don't want no trouble
[40:19] so that's about right I don't want no
[40:21] trouble hold your ticket in your hand
[40:23] because we're going over
[40:26] think of it just think of it it says
[40:28] that's great time of redemption
[40:32] that great time of redemption is at hand
[40:37] my saints that makes me happy
[40:40] because now we could be in the
[40:43] expectation of receiving the Redemption
[40:45] of the very word that God sent in this
[40:47] generation
[40:49] amen and I wanted to just maybe say a
[40:52] little bit of a portion of my testimony
[40:54] tonight not long
[40:56] but excuse me
[41:00] a lot of you guys a lot of you know my
[41:02] my past and we fellowshipped around my
[41:05] my testimony but
[41:08] you know I grew up in a very Christian
[41:09] home
[41:12] um my mom and dad always try to have the
[41:15] word of God around us they the best they
[41:17] could with what they've known and most
[41:21] of my life as a child up until about 19
[41:23] or 17 18 19 years old I grew up in the
[41:26] Pentecostal Church
[41:28] and so
[41:29] there was always something that stuck
[41:31] with me every time we would meet I know
[41:33] we would be at church every Thursday and
[41:35] every Sunday we would we would we would
[41:38] do the best we can to serve the Lord
[41:40] with what we knew
[41:42] and so
[41:43] at the age of 16
[41:46] I um I made a decision to follow the
[41:49] lord I said Lord I want to give my heart
[41:50] to you
[41:52] and I got baptized and then with the
[41:54] Lord Jesus Christ
[41:56] and so at that moment you know I had a
[42:00] fire in my heart I said Lord I want to
[42:02] follow you just like any of us you know
[42:04] you make a decision
[42:06] and you're like Lord I want to follow
[42:07] you
[42:08] and
[42:10] after I got baptized a few years later
[42:12] we end up moving out of state
[42:15] and um
[42:18] then we start pretending again on a
[42:20] Pentecostal church again and
[42:23] 2005-2006.
[42:26] and within that timing the Lord was
[42:29] dealing with me the Lord was really
[42:30] trying to show me something as we were
[42:33] just walking in this on this road that
[42:35] he was leading us and there was always
[42:38] something inside of my heart where
[42:41] I was like Lord
[42:43] your gospels being preached your words
[42:46] being said
[42:48] but the life of the people don't match
[42:50] what they're saying
[42:54] it it just always struck me how you know
[42:57] there was
[42:59] the word at the light that they've had
[43:02] but but the life was not lived according
[43:06] to even the word that was being said
[43:08] so now
[43:11] as we're just partaking of this and I'm
[43:13] the Lord's dealing with this with me
[43:17] I start just getting into things that I
[43:19] shouldn't be getting into
[43:21] and you know
[43:23] all my life
[43:25] as we hear the gospel and all these
[43:28] things there is always testimonies
[43:31] there was always things that the Lord's
[43:33] done for other people there was always
[43:35] things that the Lord's done and and and
[43:37] and and how the Lord brought this person
[43:39] out and healed this person and all these
[43:41] things
[43:42] and here I am
[43:44] I was like Lord I don't have anything
[43:49] you've walked me through all this you
[43:52] showed me all these things but if
[43:54] somebody was to ask me about who is
[43:56] Jesus Christ
[43:58] I would have no way of testifying or
[44:02] what you've done for me
[44:03] and I got down to pray and I said Lord
[44:08] I said I want you to show yourself to me
[44:13] I don't want somebody else's testimony
[44:15] to work on me
[44:17] I want you to give me my testimony
[44:21] I want you to come live inside of me and
[44:24] my life would be matched to your gospel
[44:29] and so now there was an expectation
[44:32] now my my Visions changed instead of
[44:35] just doing things out of routine
[44:38] now there was a change where God's
[44:40] wanted to show me
[44:42] what to be like revealing to me the
[44:45] truth giving me something to hold on to
[44:48] and not only to hold Alto as a
[44:51] revelation but God now was changing he
[44:55] was transforming
[44:57] and so
[45:00] we get a hold of
[45:02] the message
[45:03] of what we call
[45:05] and I'll let you know now it's the most
[45:07] beautiful thing I've ever seen
[45:10] it heals you when you're sick
[45:13] it delivers you when you're down
[45:16] it keeps you up when you're weak
[45:19] it it it it it brings you into Heavenly
[45:22] places in Christ Jesus
[45:24] and it's because it's the voice of the
[45:26] age
[45:29] and as I'm starting to
[45:32] as I'm starting to walk now into the
[45:35] message and the Lord's showing me things
[45:37] that I realized
[45:39] that God
[45:40] is wanting to manifest himself to the
[45:43] revelation of the word in me
[45:47] a personal relationship
[45:50] and so
[45:52] I was really happy
[45:54] because
[45:55] all this life there was something inside
[45:57] of me that knew that there was something
[45:59] great and I was like Lord why
[46:02] are the people now living according to
[46:04] your gospel
[46:05] and so the lord gave me a a revelation
[46:08] about that because I seeked I asked the
[46:11] Lord
[46:12] and
[46:14] and so as as the time was passing on the
[46:17] Lord was just bringing us up but let's
[46:19] turn over to Revelations 19.
[46:22] as we just continue
[46:28] his word won't come back void science
[46:31] if we seek him
[46:33] if we ask with the sincere heart he'll
[46:36] give us what we ask for
[46:39] and it's the obedience to the word
[46:42] Revelations 19.
[46:47] verses 7 through 10.
[46:54] it says let us be glad and rejoice amen
[46:58] and give honor to him
[47:01] for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[47:05] and his wife had made herself ready
[47:10] and to her was granted that she would be
[47:12] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[47:17] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[47:20] of saints
[47:21] and he said unto me write blessed are
[47:25] they which are called unto the marriage
[47:27] supper of the Lamb and he said unto me
[47:31] these are the true sayings of God
[47:34] and I fell at his feet to worship him
[47:37] and he said unto me seed thou do not I
[47:41] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[47:43] Brethren that have the testimony of
[47:46] Jesus worship God
[47:49] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[47:53] of Prophecy
[47:56] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[48:00] of Prophecy
[48:02] my when we testify who Jesus is in my
[48:05] life
[48:07] when I have a revelation of who Jesus is
[48:09] in my life it becomes the word of
[48:11] Prophecy because now we have to confess
[48:14] the very thing we believe
[48:16] amen
[48:17] it's not just good enough to say I
[48:19] believe it and just remain it on page on
[48:22] a paper it's enough for me to understand
[48:24] what God wanting it for my life how I
[48:28] can express it in my life how I can take
[48:30] the very word of God the Life of Christ
[48:33] inside of me to live
[48:35] not just one day
[48:37] every day
[48:39] not just one month but every month
[48:43] have it be consistent where now we are
[48:46] in a union with the word
[48:48] and the union comes by revelation
[48:51] it's the way he knows his bride it's the
[48:54] way he reveals the secrets to his bride
[48:57] amen
[48:59] worship God
[49:01] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[49:04] of Prophecy
[49:06] so we see that the word
[49:09] which is Jesus
[49:11] is the spirit of Prophecy and he came to
[49:14] live down Among Us
[49:18] to live down Among Us
[49:26] proving his word brother Branham says in
[49:28] 64.
[49:30] August 16th
[49:33] he says now
[49:34] we say he's raised from the dead he says
[49:37] I didn't say it the word said it here
[49:40] they said he raised from the dead
[49:43] and he's the same yesterday today and
[49:46] forever you believe that
[49:48] he promised these things to happen in
[49:50] the last day that the same son of man
[49:53] would be man would be made manifested
[49:56] now remember that Jesus was talking G it
[50:00] says not Jesus was talking to Abraham
[50:02] there says that could discern the
[50:04] thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him that
[50:07] was not Jesus he was not yet born
[50:10] but he was a man in human flesh that
[50:13] Abraham called Elohim the almighty the
[50:16] great Almighty showing it says and Jesus
[50:20] said as he was in the days of Sodom now
[50:23] watch close in the days of Sodom so will
[50:27] it be at the coming of the son of man
[50:29] when the son of man is being revealed
[50:33] it says not more as a church not no more
[50:37] he says the bride is called see in that
[50:42] day the son of man will be revealed it
[50:45] says to join the church to the Head
[50:50] to unite
[50:52] the marriage of the Bride it says
[50:56] the bridegroom call will come right
[50:59] through this
[51:01] and when the son of man will come down
[51:04] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[51:06] together the church and it has to be the
[51:10] word and he is the word and the two
[51:13] unite together and do that it'll take
[51:16] the manifestation of the revealing of
[51:19] the son of man it says not a clergy man
[51:22] I don't know he says do you see what I
[51:24] mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ
[51:28] will come down in human flesh Among Us
[51:31] and will make his word so real that it
[51:34] will unite the church in him as one
[51:37] the bride
[51:39] and she'll go home to the wedding supper
[51:42] amen she's already United
[51:45] see we go to the wedding supper not to
[51:49] the marriage it says fill your flesh
[51:53] says self
[51:55] all and of all the Flesh of mighty man
[51:59] because the marriage of the Lamb has
[52:01] come
[52:02] but the Rapture is going to the wedding
[52:05] supper
[52:06] when the word here unites with the
[52:08] person
[52:09] day two become one
[52:13] and then what does it do then it
[52:15] manifests the son of man again
[52:17] not the church theologians the son of
[52:20] man the word and the church become one
[52:24] whatsoever the son of man done he was
[52:27] the word the church does the same thing
[52:31] I believe that because it's the same
[52:34] word it's the same Angel it's the same
[52:36] truth that we believe that the prophet
[52:38] brought to us
[52:39] and once the seals have been opened Oh
[52:42] Glory to God we have access to his
[52:46] redeeming power for his word to be
[52:48] manifested inside of our hearts
[52:53] First Corinthians chapter 13
[52:58] verses 11 through 14 says
[53:01] for other Foundation can no man lay that
[53:04] is laid which is Jesus Christ
[53:07] now if any man builds upon this
[53:10] Foundation gold silver precious stones
[53:13] wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall
[53:17] be made manifest
[53:20] for the day shall declare it
[53:23] because they shall be revealed by fire
[53:26] and the fire shall try every man's work
[53:29] of what sort it is if any man's work
[53:32] abide which he had built there upon he
[53:36] shall receive a reward
[53:39] my brings me to the remembrance of the
[53:41] Hebrew children
[53:44] I wonder what word they were standing on
[53:47] they were told to bow down to an image
[53:49] of Daniel the very prophet
[53:52] they told him the bow down and it says
[53:54] no we can't do that we can't bow down to
[53:56] that false god
[53:58] and what did they do they stood upon
[54:01] what they believed because it was a
[54:02] revelation of who they had
[54:04] and what happened
[54:06] they had the right foundation
[54:08] they had the right foundation and when
[54:10] they stepped in
[54:12] a fire that was seven times harder my
[54:17] sometimes we think of these things as
[54:18] stories but these things were real
[54:21] [Music]
[54:22] these things were real
[54:24] seven times harder
[54:26] and they walk in and all of a sudden
[54:28] he's there with them
[54:30] the words there with them standing in
[54:33] their midst knowing that the Revelation
[54:35] they stood on it was a reward to them
[54:39] because their life now was saved based
[54:41] upon what they believed amen
[54:47] just like the word in the beginning
[54:51] it was spoken to us in the Garden of
[54:53] Eden it says spoken word
[54:55] and the second time it was made flesh
[54:58] and dwelt Among Us
[55:00] and the third time it became part of us
[55:04] and the Holy Ghost dwelling in us God
[55:08] coming into man
[55:10] it says first he spoke the word and the
[55:14] enemy tore down mine you could just see
[55:16] the image
[55:18] then the word was made flesh he was
[55:22] crucified but now amen there is a
[55:25] difference in the word the word is
[55:27] become the church and the church is the
[55:30] word he says God it says all that God
[55:33] was he poured into Christ and all that
[55:36] Christ was he poured into the church the
[55:38] Holy Ghost now the enemies got something
[55:41] he says see then he isn't fighting
[55:45] something back here
[55:46] many people just stick the letter the
[55:49] letter killeth but it's the spirit that
[55:51] gives life it says and and they take
[55:55] these streets and so forth still killeth
[55:57] but when you are taking the spirit
[56:00] that's God himself how do you know it's
[56:04] God because he's taking the word and
[56:07] manifesting it
[56:09] then it's God himself oh my the spoken
[56:12] word
[56:13] how do we know that's God
[56:16] when a word just doesn't become just a
[56:19] word
[56:19] but now it has to take flesh
[56:22] and me
[56:24] if it doesn't produce fruit
[56:27] I keep seeking
[56:29] I keep digging I keep asking I keep
[56:33] walking I keep going
[56:35] and before you know it you're walking
[56:37] with the Lord and you're all of a sudden
[56:38] transformed you become clean because
[56:41] even the Bible says in John 15 he says
[56:44] you are cleansed by my word which I gave
[56:46] thee
[56:47] his word is always a cleansing power
[56:50] he's worth sanctifies us his word
[56:53] cleanses us his word which is the blood
[56:56] of Jesus Christ
[56:57] cleanses us from all unbelief
[57:01] and that's an application every day
[57:04] every hour every minute of our day that
[57:06] we can because the devil is trying to
[57:10] get in between the union of God himself
[57:13] the word and his bride and now he's
[57:17] trying to deceive by giving her a little
[57:19] bit of distraction here a little bit of
[57:21] distraction here but the word of God
[57:23] gets us right back in line because we
[57:26] know what the word says amen
[57:32] how do you know it's God because he's
[57:34] taking the word and manifesting it then
[57:38] it's God himself oh my the spoken word
[57:43] brother Branham goes through in the
[57:45] Ephesian Church age and
[57:47] I'm just going to read these these few
[57:49] paragraphs here
[57:50] and he's talking about the condition of
[57:53] the church but then he talks about the
[57:54] reward at the end of each age and he
[57:58] says the first church the Ephesian
[58:00] Church
[58:02] The Works of the church
[58:04] what was condemned what they were what
[58:06] God condemned them for it says it was
[58:08] Works Without Love
[58:10] the reward was the Tree of Life
[58:13] the Church of Smyrna Was A persecuted
[58:16] Church they went through tribulations
[58:18] the reward was Crown of Life
[58:21] the third church the perimist church the
[58:24] age of the false Doctrine Satan's lying
[58:27] and the foundation of the papacy rule
[58:29] marriage to the to the church and state
[58:32] it says the reward was hit Manna and a
[58:36] white stone
[58:37] the Church of tatara was the Church of
[58:39] the people seducing the Dark Ages the
[58:42] reward was power and Rule of Nations and
[58:45] The Morning Star
[58:47] the Church of Sardis was the Reformation
[58:49] age a great missionary
[58:52] he says I'm sorry or not missionary but
[58:55] the hidden names they had their own
[58:57] names and their reward was right rape
[59:00] meant and the Book of Life
[59:02] which has to come in the judgment
[59:05] we had we had that the other day the
[59:10] Book of Life
[59:11] it says you to be judged from the book
[59:14] of light the Saints are translated and
[59:16] taken without that they don't do that
[59:18] they don't go there
[59:21] the Phila the Phila the Philadelphia
[59:23] Church age was the age of Brotherly Love
[59:25] The Great Commission age and the great
[59:29] missionary age to open the door
[59:32] the reward was a pillar revealed the
[59:36] names of God was to be during this age
[59:39] when he went around in 1906.
[59:43] the lady you'll see in church age
[59:47] the lukewarm Church Rich increased in
[59:50] Goods having need of nothing but was
[59:54] wretched poor blind miserable and naked
[59:56] and the reward was set was to sit on the
[1:00:01] throne with the Lord
[1:00:02] those who overcome that age my
[1:00:06] to sit with him on the throne
[1:00:10] for those who overcome that age
[1:00:14] overcoming the age
[1:00:16] how do we overcome
[1:00:18] by his word
[1:00:20] how do we stand the Devil by his word
[1:00:22] how do we defeat the enemy by his word
[1:00:25] and if we feed upon his word we can use
[1:00:28] the word because the word is a
[1:00:30] double-edged sword right piercing given
[1:00:33] to the divider of the Sunder of our
[1:00:35] hearts and to the marrow
[1:00:37] able to use the word of God now to fight
[1:00:41] and it has to be a revealed word
[1:00:44] otherwise they won't stand
[1:00:49] and the reward was said to it was set on
[1:00:52] the throne with the Lord
[1:00:53] Hebrews says is this way but without
[1:00:56] faith it is impossible to please him
[1:00:59] for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:01:02] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:01:06] them that diligently sick him
[1:01:09] amen he rewards you if you seek Him how
[1:01:14] does he reward you with Revelation he
[1:01:17] gives you the very word to know how to
[1:01:18] live by In This Dark Hour instead of
[1:01:21] going to Google or going to other places
[1:01:23] to find out the steps of what to do
[1:01:24] something we would rather use the word
[1:01:27] of God and have him instruct us of what
[1:01:29] to do because if we use the word it'll
[1:01:31] always be Eternal it'll never fail
[1:01:34] and the word will always produce fruits
[1:01:38] it'll always produce life it'll always
[1:01:41] produce what it was meant to produce in
[1:01:43] this generation
[1:01:50] the bride has to spend time with her
[1:01:52] Lord to know how to overcome
[1:01:55] because he already overcame
[1:01:57] and because he already overcame I can
[1:02:00] overcome through him amen it's not me
[1:02:04] that's overcoming but it's him giving me
[1:02:06] the power of His words whoever come by
[1:02:08] his word so that leaves me out of the
[1:02:10] picture
[1:02:11] I don't even have a say Lord whatever
[1:02:13] your will is lo let your will be done
[1:02:16] not my will but your will but Lord let
[1:02:19] me find you
[1:02:21] in the scripture let me find you in the
[1:02:23] message of the hour what would you like
[1:02:25] me to do today Lord who would you like
[1:02:28] me to present this very life that now
[1:02:30] I'm living for you to be able to preach
[1:02:33] this word to somebody to be able to
[1:02:35] testify at the grocery store to be able
[1:02:38] to just come and say Lord I want you to
[1:02:41] work in my life
[1:02:42] I want you to use my life I want you to
[1:02:45] use my very testimony to bring sons and
[1:02:50] daughters
[1:02:52] to bring the ones that they need the
[1:02:56] Lord
[1:02:57] to be able to testify
[1:03:02] the bright the the scripture said
[1:03:04] earlier we were reading in Revelations
[1:03:06] 19 it says that the bride had met
[1:03:08] herself ready
[1:03:10] there was something she was doing
[1:03:13] she was making herself ready to be
[1:03:15] righteous still to be holy still to
[1:03:19] continue to be cleansed by the washing
[1:03:21] of the water of the word continually
[1:03:24] amen it says that the word of God
[1:03:28] to prepare herself to overcome the
[1:03:31] temptation of this world
[1:03:33] and she would be dressed and fine linen
[1:03:37] that's the righteousness of the Saints
[1:03:41] brother Branham says this and the
[1:03:43] marriage of the lamb and this is where
[1:03:45] the Lord kind of gave me a little
[1:03:46] inspiration out of 62.
[1:03:49] January 21.
[1:03:51] he says
[1:03:53] and that we know that there's going to
[1:03:55] be a bride and there's going to be a
[1:03:58] wedding supper served in the skies
[1:04:00] that's just as sure to be as God is
[1:04:05] amen because it's his word
[1:04:09] and we know that those that are going to
[1:04:12] make up that bride is going to be his
[1:04:15] church and they're going to appear
[1:04:17] before him without spot or wrinkle
[1:04:20] and they have the material on earth now
[1:04:24] to make themselves ready
[1:04:27] if you notice she has to make herself
[1:04:30] ready
[1:04:32] we have the material
[1:04:34] and they have the material on earth now
[1:04:37] to make themselves ready
[1:04:39] Saints how much am I getting ready
[1:04:43] what is my consecrated life now outside
[1:04:46] the church walls at home it might be an
[1:04:49] intimate with my Lord am I praying day
[1:04:52] and night asking God to come in my life
[1:04:55] and change me because we're supposed to
[1:04:57] have a transformation of these bodies
[1:04:59] we're supposed to be walking into a new
[1:05:02] body now this transformation is coming
[1:05:04] by this word being revealed in us and
[1:05:08] I'll say this the prophet
[1:05:11] was manifesting that
[1:05:13] because the very word that came through
[1:05:16] the trunk changed the very Trump to show
[1:05:19] us what it's like to be a believer of
[1:05:21] God's word unadulterated
[1:05:24] and God now wants us to take this word
[1:05:27] because it came for me
[1:05:30] it came to cleanse me it came to redeem
[1:05:33] me it came specifically for me for my
[1:05:36] life
[1:05:37] to be able to show me to lead me to
[1:05:40] guide me to tell me
[1:05:42] Where I Belong what is my identity
[1:05:52] it says so many ways verse 54.
[1:05:57] if the Lord will take this evil spirit
[1:05:59] from me
[1:06:00] from drinking or from gambling or from
[1:06:03] lying or stealing I'll serve him
[1:06:05] but said that's up to you see you got
[1:06:09] something to do
[1:06:10] they that overcome Sharon Herod all
[1:06:13] things they that overcome you have the
[1:06:18] power to do it but you must be willing
[1:06:21] to lay it down
[1:06:23] see she had made herself ready I like
[1:06:27] that word the same way it is about
[1:06:29] Divine Healing God has the power to heal
[1:06:33] you if you've got the courage to accept
[1:06:36] it
[1:06:37] but you'll have to fight every winch of
[1:06:40] the way
[1:06:42] God has an amazing grace to save you and
[1:06:45] he will do it but you'll have to fight
[1:06:47] every inch of the way
[1:06:50] I've been behind the pulpit going on 31
[1:06:52] years and every inch of that has been a
[1:06:56] fight constantly it certainly has but we
[1:06:59] must fight if we must reign so we find
[1:07:03] out that the bride has to make herself
[1:07:06] ready be willing to lay aside every
[1:07:09] weight that does so easily beset us
[1:07:13] that we might run with patience the race
[1:07:16] that set before us
[1:07:18] we must lay them aside ourselves
[1:07:21] we can't say God you come lay them aside
[1:07:25] for us we got to do it ourselves
[1:07:28] my
[1:07:30] I gotta get myself ready
[1:07:34] yeah there's a preparation that a
[1:07:36] Believer must have
[1:07:38] he's got to be dressed by the word
[1:07:40] dressed by the revealing of the word in
[1:07:43] our life
[1:07:45] the character of the fruit of the tree
[1:07:47] of life has to be manifested in me
[1:07:49] because it was the very thing that
[1:07:52] overcame through all the ages
[1:07:56] the reward the reward was to believe on
[1:07:59] his word and he brought you out he he he
[1:08:02] made an escape for you he saved you
[1:08:10] verse 81 and the same in the same sermon
[1:08:13] it says now marriage in one sense is a
[1:08:17] type
[1:08:19] the Earthly marriage here is the type of
[1:08:21] the Heavenly marriage now let's go over
[1:08:24] it just a few moments to rehearse at a
[1:08:26] moment
[1:08:28] the first thing there is there must be a
[1:08:31] decision made
[1:08:33] the first thing is as it takes a natural
[1:08:36] marriage is a decision has to be made
[1:08:39] the young lady has to make her decision
[1:08:42] whether she wants this young man
[1:08:45] and the young man
[1:08:47] whether he wants the young woman
[1:08:50] and it says there has to be a decision
[1:08:52] made and you have to make it see she she
[1:08:57] must be the only woman in the world that
[1:09:00] you love
[1:09:02] and he must be the only man if it isn't
[1:09:05] then you've made a wrong decision
[1:09:08] and that's the same way by making a
[1:09:10] decision for for Christ the first thing
[1:09:14] you have to do is make up your mind
[1:09:16] whether you're going to serve God and
[1:09:19] take him as your savior or you're going
[1:09:21] or you're not going to do it are you
[1:09:23] going to serve the world are you going
[1:09:25] to serve Christ
[1:09:27] you're going to make up your mind it
[1:09:29] says there has to be a decision made
[1:09:31] when you make up your mind that you're
[1:09:34] either going to serve God or Mama then
[1:09:37] you take your choice but the decision
[1:09:39] has to be made
[1:09:41] we have to make a decision today every
[1:09:44] day
[1:09:45] what am I going to choose am I going to
[1:09:47] choose the word of God or am I going to
[1:09:50] choose something that takes me away from
[1:09:51] the word of God
[1:09:53] and it starts with the little things
[1:09:55] it starts with the little things before
[1:09:57] you know it you just it gets to the
[1:09:59] bigger things because we get we get
[1:10:00] carried away
[1:10:02] right we lose the love of the word by
[1:10:06] feeding more on belief and concentrating
[1:10:08] on doing more on belief instead of
[1:10:10] loving the very word of God for this
[1:10:13] hour
[1:10:14] and the word of God has to take flesh
[1:10:16] it has to take flesh in me it has to
[1:10:19] take flesh in you it can't just remain
[1:10:21] on the tape it can't just remain on
[1:10:23] paper we have to manifest the word of
[1:10:26] God
[1:10:29] verse 84 and then
[1:10:32] after the decision is made
[1:10:35] that you are then comes the engagement
[1:10:39] that you find that at the altar
[1:10:42] you've got to make an engagement before
[1:10:45] this Union can be
[1:10:47] and that's the way it is with Christ's
[1:10:49] Church
[1:10:50] it has to be an engagement with Christ a
[1:10:53] pledge an engagement A Love Affair
[1:10:58] we have to love the word of God it
[1:11:01] doesn't have to be something that we
[1:11:02] just do because we were told but we have
[1:11:04] to find the love of the word to be
[1:11:07] manifested in my life
[1:11:09] and now when I pray and I seek God he's
[1:11:12] a rewarder of the one that diligently
[1:11:15] seeks him because he gives Revelations
[1:11:18] to those that seek Revelation and the
[1:11:21] revelation of Jesus Christ in me only
[1:11:24] makes the maturity grow Yonder it brings
[1:11:28] you more up into the stature of Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ
[1:11:31] because it starts with faith and it
[1:11:34] gives you virtue and then you and and
[1:11:36] all of a sudden we become sons and
[1:11:39] maturity
[1:11:43] verse 85 it says
[1:11:45] and then after the engagement it says in
[1:11:48] Dan the next thing is is promises made
[1:11:52] there has to be a promise made to one
[1:11:55] another
[1:11:56] like you make a promise sweetheart if
[1:11:59] you'll marry me I promise that I'll be
[1:12:01] loyal and true I will look upon no other
[1:12:04] woman I'll look upon no other man I'll
[1:12:08] do all that as a duty as a wife we have
[1:12:13] children I'll do I'll do all as a duty
[1:12:17] as a mother I'll be a housekeeper all
[1:12:21] these promises he's got to be made or
[1:12:24] should be in a correct wedding
[1:12:27] and that's the same way that's the same
[1:12:29] thing when you come to Christ Lord if
[1:12:32] you'll receive me into your kingdom I
[1:12:34] promise there you are I'll love you I'll
[1:12:37] be true to you I'll serve you day and
[1:12:40] night it's too bad we forget that I'll
[1:12:43] serve you day and night I'll fast I'll
[1:12:46] pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my
[1:12:48] Tidings into the storehouse I'll pray
[1:12:50] many times a day I'll do anything I'll
[1:12:53] pledge all my love to you
[1:12:56] that's what you should do that's exactly
[1:13:00] right where your promise that and it
[1:13:03] should come from your hearts
[1:13:08] if you promise your husband that
[1:13:11] and not from your heart you mean it you
[1:13:14] absolutely not living correctly with
[1:13:16] them it's kind of a crystallized affair
[1:13:21] it becomes that letter
[1:13:24] because we have to live
[1:13:26] by the word
[1:13:28] the word has to be our instructor the
[1:13:32] word has to be our leader
[1:13:34] the message of the hour has to be the
[1:13:36] very thing that's leading and guiding us
[1:13:41] in verse 94
[1:13:45] but you see so first decisions made next
[1:13:48] engagement and then promise and then
[1:13:52] the ceremony
[1:13:54] and that's the bride it says bride takes
[1:13:57] the bridegroom's name
[1:13:59] she is no more than of her own name
[1:14:03] she takes the bridegroom's name
[1:14:06] and when and then when the church has
[1:14:09] the ceremony
[1:14:10] it makes their promises then she takes
[1:14:14] the bridegroom's name then she's no
[1:14:17] longer a church of the world
[1:14:19] she is the Church of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:21] Christ amen I I don't mean that by name
[1:14:25] I mean that by the birth
[1:14:28] by Nature by power of God by the
[1:14:33] revealed truth of God and thine heart
[1:14:35] she becomes a Christian Church the great
[1:14:39] Universal Apostolic Christian Church she
[1:14:42] becomes as a part of Christ when she
[1:14:45] does that see she Christ injects into
[1:14:49] her his own spirit
[1:14:52] his own life the Bible said to Adam and
[1:14:55] Eve you no longer are Twain but you're
[1:14:59] one
[1:15:00] and the woman the church is married to
[1:15:03] Christ they are no longer two they are
[1:15:05] one
[1:15:06] Christ in you amen that's it his life
[1:15:09] has been brought into you then you
[1:15:13] become the bride
[1:15:16] because we're bone of his bone we're
[1:15:18] flesh of his flesh we're word of his
[1:15:20] word and we're manifesting the very Life
[1:15:24] of Christ and us
[1:15:30] the uniting of the bride and the groom
[1:15:35] the cleansing of the word Upon Our Life
[1:15:39] to be able to cleanse us to be able to
[1:15:41] wash us from all unbelief to give us
[1:15:44] faith in the word knowing that it comes
[1:15:47] to pass
[1:15:48] not just say it comes to pass to see it
[1:15:50] come to pass in our life to be able to
[1:15:53] know God I stand on your truth there was
[1:15:56] a prophet in this generation that prayed
[1:15:58] for the sick a lot
[1:16:00] and he stood in the in the pulpit and he
[1:16:02] said I'll pray for a thousand people
[1:16:05] and if they don't get healed I'll pray
[1:16:07] from again the next day because his word
[1:16:10] never fails
[1:16:12] and it's by the revelation of the word
[1:16:14] in its proper time and season that God
[1:16:16] wants to use it he wants you to manifest
[1:16:18] the word every day every day every day
[1:16:22] it's a constant walk it's a constant
[1:16:24] Union
[1:16:30] paragraph 109 it says
[1:16:34] it was a beautiful type of what God
[1:16:37] did a Calvary
[1:16:40] that he overcame
[1:16:43] he overcame hell death and the grave at
[1:16:48] Calvary
[1:16:49] to be able to come and live inside of a
[1:16:52] bride
[1:16:53] to cleanse her to wash her to lead her
[1:16:56] and to show her
[1:17:00] he took Christ and connected him with
[1:17:03] the church
[1:17:05] through a Riven side
[1:17:07] he brought the blood that cleansed the
[1:17:10] person that sanctifies the Flesh of the
[1:17:13] church and puts the spirit of the Living
[1:17:16] God that he took off the cross there out
[1:17:20] of Christ and puts it into the
[1:17:22] individual then they are one they become
[1:17:27] one Christ and you are one and you and
[1:17:31] your husband should be one and if
[1:17:34] there's anything contrary
[1:17:36] then there's something wrong with your
[1:17:37] union
[1:17:39] and so we see
[1:17:41] that he brought the blood that cleansed
[1:17:45] the person that Sanctified the Flesh of
[1:17:48] the church and puts the spirit of the
[1:17:52] Living God and us
[1:17:58] paragraph one from 87 it says God calls
[1:18:01] you as an individual
[1:18:03] and it's you
[1:18:05] that's got to clean up because he's
[1:18:09] taking the people from the Gentile for
[1:18:11] his namesake
[1:18:13] his bride the Gentile
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:19] my that makes me happy
[1:18:22] that makes me just want to praise the
[1:18:23] Lord because I know
[1:18:27] that the word is there any time we need
[1:18:32] it
[1:18:34] it's always there
[1:18:36] it's always there for us it's a matter
[1:18:38] of how much we run to the word to seek
[1:18:42] for deliverance to seek for healing to
[1:18:45] seek for Revelation to seek him in
[1:18:47] prayer to seek him and see him in our
[1:18:49] life
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:57] I'll do the will of my father because I
[1:19:00] love him
[1:19:01] not because I have to
[1:19:04] I do the will of the father
[1:19:07] We Live the Life of Christ because we
[1:19:11] love to because there's a love that now
[1:19:14] lives inside of us to the word and that
[1:19:17] love is being expressed not only into
[1:19:21] our surroundings but everywhere that's
[1:19:23] Divine love where we can now share
[1:19:25] eternal life
[1:19:27] now we can share the love of Christ
[1:19:29] Living inside of our hearts
[1:19:33] I'll invite the musicians to come we can
[1:19:35] start closing here
[1:19:42] she had made herself ready
[1:19:44] she took the word and she had made
[1:19:47] herself ready
[1:19:49] because there was a word
[1:19:51] that she kept as a prophecy
[1:19:54] because she kept the very word of this
[1:19:56] hour to change her to transform her to
[1:19:59] take her from the condition to where
[1:20:01] she's at to be more righteous
[1:20:03] let him that be righteous be righteous
[1:20:05] still we got to keep our righteousness
[1:20:08] let him be that let him that's holy let
[1:20:10] me let him be holy still amen
[1:20:16] brother Branham
[1:20:18] uses this story here in this message
[1:20:22] and it says let me tell you a little
[1:20:24] something that happened
[1:20:28] he says I'm a missionary
[1:20:30] as you know
[1:20:31] it says do Evangelistic missionary work
[1:20:33] about seven times overseas around the
[1:20:36] world here not long ago in the city of
[1:20:38] Rome Rome is the great city of Art
[1:20:42] they had a school of art there and
[1:20:46] several of our American Young Folks go
[1:20:48] over there every year
[1:20:50] to take a year or two training
[1:20:53] in order to learn paint to learn to
[1:20:57] paint pictures
[1:20:58] there was a group of young Americans
[1:21:00] over there a few years ago
[1:21:03] as the story was told me and when they
[1:21:06] got when they get over there
[1:21:08] they just go Hog Wild
[1:21:12] when they're in Rome they do as their
[1:21:14] room as the Rome does they get out and
[1:21:17] drink and strip themselves and do
[1:21:19] everything else and carry on both girl
[1:21:21] both boys and girls and there was a
[1:21:23] certain school and in this school
[1:21:26] this group of young Americans over there
[1:21:29] every one of them almost did the same
[1:21:32] thing but there was a certain little
[1:21:33] girl
[1:21:35] she wouldn't tolerate it at all she
[1:21:38] stayed in
[1:21:40] at night time
[1:21:42] she read while they were that while they
[1:21:45] were all out drinking daytime she worked
[1:21:48] study well she was at while she was the
[1:21:53] laughing stock of the whole school and
[1:21:55] she kept herself like a lady
[1:21:58] conducted herself like a lady although
[1:22:01] there was young Roman boys and
[1:22:03] everything around trying to get her to
[1:22:05] go out she refused it no sir she stayed
[1:22:09] right with her lessons learning to draw
[1:22:12] into pain rather
[1:22:15] and she stayed with it
[1:22:17] finally an old custodian at the place
[1:22:19] kept watching her sing she was so much
[1:22:22] different although she was a Roman
[1:22:25] Catholic kept watching her how she
[1:22:27] conducted herself one evening the young
[1:22:30] girl in the park where the studio was
[1:22:33] why or the place where they had school
[1:22:36] she wanted she walked out upon the
[1:22:39] campus and went up towards the top of
[1:22:41] the hill
[1:22:42] and the sun was setting
[1:22:44] and she was standing up there with her
[1:22:47] pretty clean face and her hair hanging
[1:22:50] down looking across that way towards the
[1:22:53] setting of the Sun
[1:22:54] the Oakland State the old custodian was
[1:22:58] ranking down in the yard he kept
[1:23:00] watching the girl and he ranked
[1:23:03] something just kept telling him go talk
[1:23:05] to her
[1:23:06] so he laid his Rick down took off his
[1:23:09] old slouch hat walked up where the young
[1:23:12] lady was cleared up his throat
[1:23:16] she turned around and he said pardon me
[1:23:18] Miss
[1:23:19] she said yes sir certainly
[1:23:22] and he noticed she had been crying
[1:23:25] all the rest was out on a big spree for
[1:23:29] the night he said madame
[1:23:31] I hope that you understand me in the
[1:23:34] right way that I'm just going to speak
[1:23:37] to you
[1:23:38] I said you've been here almost two years
[1:23:41] now and I've noticed the group that
[1:23:43] you've come with continually they're out
[1:23:46] on parties and coming in all times at
[1:23:49] night drunk and clothes hats off of them
[1:23:51] and everything but I know it is that you
[1:23:53] don't attend such parties and said I
[1:23:56] know it is that seemingly that you're
[1:23:58] always looking across the sea
[1:24:01] of an evening
[1:24:03] you walk up there and stand here each
[1:24:05] evening and watch the Sun go down
[1:24:09] and he said and said
[1:24:12] what
[1:24:14] what caused that what causes that it
[1:24:17] says I'm an old man
[1:24:19] and I'm I'm curious to know
[1:24:22] what causes this difference between you
[1:24:24] and the others
[1:24:25] she said yes sir she said I'm looking
[1:24:28] towards home when the Sun is setting she
[1:24:32] said a cross beyond that sun Yonder in
[1:24:34] my homeland and she said in that land
[1:24:37] there's a certain state
[1:24:40] and in that certain State there's a
[1:24:42] certain city and in that certain city
[1:24:44] there's a certain house and in that
[1:24:46] certain house is a certain boy
[1:24:48] said he too is an artist when I left to
[1:24:52] come over here
[1:24:54] I pledge my love to him
[1:24:58] we're engaged to one another and she
[1:25:01] said no matter what any of the rest of
[1:25:03] them does
[1:25:04] that has nothing to do with me
[1:25:07] she said I promise to live true and
[1:25:11] right and she said I'm longing for the
[1:25:14] day when I feel myself on the top of the
[1:25:17] wings of that big plane that will take
[1:25:19] me across the sea and set me down at the
[1:25:23] airport where he'll meet me
[1:25:25] he's building a home
[1:25:28] and will live together in that land
[1:25:31] and said that's the reason I act the way
[1:25:34] I do
[1:25:35] I'm true
[1:25:37] to the promise that I've made a boy
[1:25:40] and he's true to the promise that he
[1:25:42] makes he makes me said I hear from him
[1:25:45] now and then and I write to him and said
[1:25:49] corresponding with one another we're
[1:25:51] still holding our vows waiting for the
[1:25:54] day to meet
[1:25:56] my
[1:25:57] what a story if we could just stand
[1:26:01] we're now
[1:26:03] we're holding to our vow
[1:26:07] we're knowing that
[1:26:10] he's redeemed the bride that loves him
[1:26:13] because he first loved her
[1:26:16] and we were always there
[1:26:20] we were always there
[1:26:22] he just allowed us to walk through this
[1:26:24] time
[1:26:25] to recognize him
[1:26:28] who he is by his word to be able to
[1:26:31] instruct us to be able to live inside of
[1:26:34] us
[1:26:34] it says oh how that would do for a real
[1:26:37] Christian
[1:26:39] to get away from the things of the world
[1:26:42] and someday you talk about coming into a
[1:26:45] port on the wings of a dove
[1:26:48] he's coming for a bride one that don't
[1:26:53] fool with the world or the things of the
[1:26:55] world she is washed in the blood of the
[1:26:59] Lamb
[1:27:00] she's pledged her
[1:27:02] her love to him only the love of the
[1:27:06] world is gone and dead to her the
[1:27:09] marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:27:11] and the bride has made herself ready
[1:27:15] my
[1:27:17] we have a reward
[1:27:21] a reward by seeking
[1:27:24] for Revelation and that reward is the
[1:27:28] spirit of Christ inside of us living
[1:27:30] through US showing us how to overcome
[1:27:34] using the very word of this hour the
[1:27:38] revealed word of this message

[1:27:43] generation

[1:34:10] oh as I grow away
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:20] away
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:23] did you enjoy the word
[1:34:25] amen
[1:34:27] My Eyes giving us the material to get
[1:34:29] ready
[1:34:30] it's giving us his word whatever we have
[1:34:33] need of I like that story because that
[1:34:36] that little girl took it personal
[1:34:39] she didn't care what others were doing
[1:34:41] and it was very personal to her The Vow
[1:34:44] that she made and she purposed within
[1:34:47] herself that nothing else will matter
[1:34:50] and and that's the attitude as Christian
[1:34:52] we need to have it's not being attracted
[1:34:55] over here that that attracts you and
[1:34:57] everything it's a personal vow God I'm
[1:35:00] gonna leave your word and I'm gonna do
[1:35:02] everything I know what your word said is
[1:35:04] what I'll do I don't care if the person
[1:35:07] sitting next to me is not
[1:35:09] I will do it because it's in my heart to
[1:35:12] do man and husband and wife I will do
[1:35:15] the word
[1:35:16] and I think when we get that kind of
[1:35:19] attitude it brings us together because
[1:35:21] we have the same heartbeat we have the
[1:35:23] same desire I'll say this you know
[1:35:27] there's a lot of people that would bring
[1:35:29] you know we get into this realm of the
[1:35:33] the word where you know people are
[1:35:35] there's so much that's been said about
[1:35:37] the message and the things but I'll say
[1:35:39] this this is the only message that's
[1:35:42] promised to bring you into the rapture
[1:35:47] I I like that quote that he read because
[1:35:50] it's important you understand what the
[1:35:52] manifestation of the son of man is
[1:35:54] actually doing to us because we have all
[1:35:58] kinds of bookstores and all kinds of
[1:35:59] books out there and and there's more
[1:36:02] that's going to be written but it's the
[1:36:04] manifestation of the son of man that
[1:36:07] really brings the attraction to the
[1:36:09] bride
[1:36:10] because why the word that was promised
[1:36:13] is now being fulfilled and I like that
[1:36:16] it says it's when you take this message
[1:36:19] this word because everybody can bring on
[1:36:22] their own interpretation tell you what
[1:36:24] this means what the end of the world is
[1:36:26] going to be and all of those things and
[1:36:27] and you know what the generations we
[1:36:30] live in but there's not no one that can
[1:36:33] come and take it and prove to you by the
[1:36:36] word of God by the spirit of God this
[1:36:39] message is the very interpretation of
[1:36:41] the age by God's word what he promised
[1:36:44] it will happen in the time that we are
[1:36:46] living in and it's the only thing that
[1:36:49] will get us ready let's not look
[1:36:51] elsewhere or be confused or or get into
[1:36:54] some states where you are not sure oh
[1:36:57] this is the time to pledge this is the
[1:37:00] time to have a single heart and to have
[1:37:03] singleness of heart to say God I'll stay
[1:37:05] upon your word I will eat of it and I'll
[1:37:07] let it change me I'll let it bring about
[1:37:10] that change that I need in order to be
[1:37:12] ready for the Rapture oh that's my heart
[1:37:14] to say as I was hearing it I said God
[1:37:16] let me be ready by Your Word
[1:37:19] let me do my part so you can do your
[1:37:22] part it said when we take this reveal
[1:37:24] word of the Yahweh it will manifest the
[1:37:27] son of man again
[1:37:30] so the manifestation didn't just stop
[1:37:33] with the prophet the manifestation will
[1:37:35] follow wherever the word is being
[1:37:37] followed
[1:37:38] I like that because it's the same God
[1:37:41] it's the same word it's God fulfilling
[1:37:45] his prophecy
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:48] oh my I just feel real good amen
[1:37:53] Amen brother Andrew if it could just
[1:37:56] come and dismiss us tonight
[1:37:59] thank you
[1:38:09] certainly enjoyed the word tonight
[1:38:11] I just want to give a quick testimony I
[1:38:13] just feel it's in line with what the
[1:38:15] heartbeat of God is tonight
[1:38:17] I had made it known about eight uh 14
[1:38:21] months ago that my stepdad had
[1:38:23] contracted
[1:38:25] kidney failure after he got the third
[1:38:28] round of vaccines and it was looking
[1:38:30] really bad for him they didn't have much
[1:38:33] hope for him and then after some further
[1:38:34] test they found that he had a real
[1:38:36] aggressive form of leukemia
[1:38:39] and so they they had sowed a seed in his
[1:38:43] mind of well we don't know if you're
[1:38:45] going to live or not and um
[1:38:48] you know because we received this word
[1:38:51] of righteousness there's something that
[1:38:53] moved on my heart and said you know what
[1:38:55] though the doctor said that by his
[1:38:58] stripes you were healed and he began to
[1:39:00] accept a different report
[1:39:02] and over over time what has happened we
[1:39:05] went and visited him last summer and he
[1:39:08] ended up about 15 years ago giving me a
[1:39:11] vial of anointing oil where I started
[1:39:13] testifying to him over the 15 years
[1:39:16] since he gave me that oil I've went to
[1:39:19] hospitals I've fulfilled the word of God
[1:39:21] over and over and over and seen the
[1:39:24] faithful hand of God to produce a
[1:39:26] righteous act because God made the
[1:39:28] promise to us and I told him the
[1:39:30] testimony I said this is the word of God
[1:39:33] and we're going to do this because it's
[1:39:35] God's word and we're fulfilling it and
[1:39:38] we did that and now it was about three
[1:39:40] weeks ago he told me he called me said
[1:39:43] you know I'm still on dialysis but I
[1:39:45] forgot to tell you
[1:39:47] the doctor told me I'm cancer-free
[1:39:50] you know this is our God to take the
[1:39:55] word of God into our heart and let God
[1:39:57] produce our righteous action amen that's
[1:40:00] the power of this Word of Promise let's
[1:40:03] pray together Heavenly Father
[1:40:05] Lord what a what a wonderful reminder oh
[1:40:08] god of what you want to do Lord You
