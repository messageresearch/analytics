Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 2nd, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Uh there will be an adult and youth choir practice uh uh right after service in in this morning in the fellowship uh uh uh hall and it's uh so right after service this morning just go in [music] the fellowship hall for the choir practice. Amen. Also, brother Tim is going to be making some announcements about the youth uh sorry the uh Sunday school. Um like I said this morning, [music] brother Matthew is preaching up in uh Oklahoma and I know that there's a group that went with them. We want to remember them this [music] morning. Amen. Don't forget our meetings. I believe is about two weeks from today. [music] Uh so if we could just do all that we can and you know take off from work and [music] pray and and just how many how many actually get excited about special meetings? I I tell you there's such [music] an expectation that people come with that the Lord does special things and [music] I I believe we all have needs this morning. Amen. As we still in the human body, we'll have needs but I believe that when we bring those needs before [music] him, he will answer it. Not just for the meeting even this morning, it's our expectation that [music] determines what we will receive from him. Amen. Also, brother Darien writes uh [music] is asking uh praise report for sister Doran. Uh she uh has been taken off the oxygen and uh she's being treated [music] to eliminate uh uh uh melanoma cells and thank you all for your prayers this [music] morning. So, we're going to continue to pray for her. Amen. Um, brother uh Jose writes, "Please pray for Dan [music] uh uh but uh brother Dan Apollo Appalonio son um he had an emergency surgery and everything went well. We're just [music] praying for a faster recovery." Amen. Amen. We know um want to just remember sister Leslie this morning. She's home not feeling well. We just [music] pray that the Lord will lift her up. If you have a need upon your heart, why don't you just lift your hand up this morning to him and we'll invite brother Tim to make the [music] announcements and to pray for the needs this morning and the brothers that are taking the offerings [music] if you could come when you're ready uh right after brother Tim prays. Amen. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good morning to you. Shalom. Shalom. Peace be unto you. Uh it's an exciting time of the year. Many things are happening as we, as the brother said, we look forward to the meetings coming coming up. And we're getting ready for the uh Sunday school to put on a another Christmas program for you. And uh we've already started this morning. Uh there won't be Sunday school. They're actually practicing songs and their parts over there getting things arranged. [clears throat] And uh I just want to cover a couple things. My better threequarters is not with me this morning, so I have to make sure I get this right. Um, it's going to be December the 13th at 700 p.m. All right. We want your children here about 6:00 p.m. so we can prepare them, get them ready. We're [clears throat] going to put on a program we're calling uh uh Christmas Road Trip, the journey of a lifetime. Um, I think it'll be a blessing to both the children and to you. We're gonna they're going to be getting some handouts for their [music] parts, either reading scriptures, acting out their parts or and the singing of the songs. So, we ask that you would kind of help them with that. If you want to learn the songs with them, that's great. Um, but, uh, it'll be a benefit if we can get them here about 9:30 is when the doors are going to open. So, the earlier we can get them to Sunday school, the better uh we'll be prepared and practiced. We'll say on November 30th, there will be a a hold over practice. We'll provide pizza, excuse me, as a meal between services and they're going to stay over and practice during that time. So, uh uh pizza lunch will be provided then. Um, I think that uh just about covers it. Amen. I want to make sure I cover everything. So, 7 700 p.m. have your children here at 6 [music] on the 13th of December. Okay? And then November 30th, we're going to hold them over and practice between. Okay? You know, I was very appreciative of Brother George's song, We Need Him Right Now. I was reading the book of Job and knowing the trials he went through. He said, "Oh, if I knew where I might find him, I wouldn't make my way to his seat." And where is his seat this morning? I'm not saying we're overcrowded and he doesn't have space. But it's a seat in our hearts that we have to make room and allow the Lord Jesus to have preeminence. There's needs this morning that been read, serious needs. There's needs of my own family. [snorts] It's a heartfelt cry. Sometimes we don't even know how to pray, but our groanings and utterings, the Lord can perceive all of those things, even our thoughts. So if you have a need, just slip your hand up and say, "Lord, I have a special need." Like Job said, "I went forward, he wasn't there. I went backward and I couldn't perceive [music] him. On the left, where it doesn't work, &gt;&gt; he said I couldn't behold him. On the right, but Lord, you know my steps. You're going to try me and I'm going to come forth as gold." [music] Think of that. the struggles we're going through, there'll be nothing when we reach the end of the way. [music] If we would, let's just all stand and go to the Lord in prayer. [snorts] Oh, gracious Lord. [snorts] Lord, we're so humbled. We get emotional. [music] Lord, we get tenderhearted when we approach your throne because Lord, we know [music] it's only by the the [snorts] blood of a redeemed one, a perfect lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world, Lord, that you can have us come into your presence, Lord. We're all sinners saved by grace. We've been cleaned up. Baptism, repentance, all these things. Lord, you filled us with your spirit, but yet Lord, we were in this hall of flesh, these old things that would just hinder and keep your spirit from moving. So [snorts] this morning, Lord, I pray in earnest, Lord, that these things can just be dissolved and wiped away. We can enter into a special place, Lord, of communion with you, [snorts] just like the high priests that would go into the holiest of holies. Everything was pre-arranged and ordained [snorts] and there was comfort. There was safety in knowing that everything was just right. He'd been cleaned. He'd been adorned in the right apparel. Everything was set aside. And Lord, we so often come in your presence so callous and so unconcerned. [snorts] But Lord, we're we're approaching you as our father and the creator of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know our thoughts. You know our hearts. There's doors and doors, Lord, that we try to keep private, but you know it all. [music] So we, Lord, we lift up our souls to you and ask you to clean us within and without, Lord, that nothing would hinder our prayer [music] in the expectation of our heart, Lord, knowing that if we bind our faith together, that you can answer each of these needs that have been read, each of these needs that have been shown by the uplifted hand, those that are in our hearts. Lord, we [snorts] pray that you just answer each one according to your word, your will, and as you'd see fit, Lord. Lead, guide, and direct us. Lord, we know the time is short. And when the word comes forth this morning, Lord, if it convicts our heart, we say amen. If we recognize it, say amen to it, Lord, then you will benefit us. Add it to our stature, Lord. Our word upon word, line upon line. Pray Lord we just be built up today as we leave here we can have confidence in knowing that you spoke to us along the way [snorts] Lord the ti and offering use it for your honor and glory as well Lord as we have these upcoming meetings may you just light a fire in our hearts Lord come with expectation and know truly [snorts] Lord it's not by some special gathering or or a crowd but Lord there's preparation we set aside these times and these things Lord we want to draw close to you [snorts] we grant Lord Lord, that you just use us as you'd see fit as we give you the honor, the glory, and the praise. And we ask it all in the lovely name of the Lord [snorts] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let all sing. Oh, one day at the top, [singing and music] you may have your seats. Oh, sweet Jesus, that's all I cascade [music and singing] of you. Oh, help me to do every day what I have to [music] do. Oh, yes. This [music] is to Jesus and to all [music] [music] the way. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Why don't we sing our first verse? And I [music] know you just [music] help [singing] me [music] what I could be and all that I am. [music] Oh, [singing] and show me the way. [music and singing] Oh, and to Oh, I love for my s. [music] Oh, teach me today. Oh, I [singing] [music] [music] sweet [singing] Jesus. That's what [music] I'ming on. [music] Oh, just give me a friend to do [music] everything that I [music] [singing] Jesus. [music] [music] Oh, show me the way. &gt;&gt; Oh, show [singing and music] me the way. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that second verse as [music] we just call our sister. You remember [music] [music] Jesus [music] [music] Oh [music] my go [music] [singing] [music] teach me today one [music] day at a time. Oh my [music] sweet [singing] Jesus, that's all [music] I [singing] [music] just me to do what I have to do. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, there is [singing] sweet Jesus and tomorrow. [music and singing] Lord, [music] help me today. Show me the way. [music] Peace. More [singing] like you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; less like me. That [singing] is how [music] I long to be here. Oh Lord, [singing] my [music] earest peace more like you and less like me. If [music and singing] I stumble, if I [singing] fall, let [music] your faithful judgement [singing] stall. Help me not [singing] in sin consume. Let your [music and singing] work in me restore. More like you, [music] less like me. [music] That [singing] is how I long to be here. Oh Lord, [music and singing] my earest peace. More [singing] like you and less like [music] me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When I bow [singing] my head to pray, give me Lord [singing] the words to [music] say. And when my [singing] soul's in deep distress to [singing] your throne, [music] help me to press [singing] [music] more like you, less like me. That is how [singing] I long [music] to be here. [singing] Oh Lord, my heart is [music] clean. More like you and less [music and singing] like me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Bring your blessings to my mind. [singing] Help to [music] me. Lord, you've been so [singing] kind. When your spirit takes control. [singing] Oh, let the hell in Louis. [music and singing] More like you, [singing] less like me. That is how [singing] I long [music] to be. Here, [singing] oh Lord, my earest, more [singing] like you and [music] less like me. And one [singing] day, Lord, I know I'll be more like [music and singing] you. I want to be more like you. Lord, let me be [singing] more like you. Live like me. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. The image of the perfect son. Amen. As we turn our hearts to the word at this time, let us sing. I I lift your name. [music] Amen. Lord, my heart can grow so far away and cold. Oh, and yet for me [music] your love is still the same. Oh our [music] Lord, [singing] a man mighty in God and fear of he. Oh, and my [singing and music] head bow down in reverence to your name. I [music] praise your name. [music] Your holy name. Oh adore [music] God. [music] Oh, the great [music] [music] my [singing] comfort. [music] Let's all stand and sing it as we [music] find our pastor this morning. Oh Lord, my heart [music] is &gt;&gt; just sing it as you pray this morning with your spirit. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; and my purp. [singing] [music] [music] [music] [music] born [singing] to be afraid to go [music] through. Oh, [music] [singing] [music and singing] you all [music] might [music] [singing] to the great. [music] Oh, when you come [music] sing one more time this morning. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] your [music] holy name. [music] [music] All [music] the great I am. Oh, [music] I [music] [music] Amen. Let's pray this [music] morning. our gracious heavenly father. Lord, [music] we are your children and we're so thankful to have a father like you that [music] loves us and knows what we have need of and gently guides us with love and mercy. Lord, we ask you this morning that you would enlighten us and you would open our hearts to your word and Father that we could receive it knowing, Father, it was spoken on our behalf and for us. And we're grateful for that. We ask you to bless your people now in Jesus precious [music] name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to a a couple real common scriptures in Genesis 1 and the Gospel of St. John 1 and 1 and Genesis 1 through3. I certainly enjoyed that song this morning, Brother Georgees. I was in my office trying to get my voice that low, you know, and uh it was good. And also I thank all the Sunday school kids for all the uh wonderful uh cards and paintings and everything [snorts] they gave me. And they gave me a a box of cards. And so I opened it up and the first card I took out had a turtle on it. And I thought, well, you know, I'm getting pretty slow. I thought that that's prophecy, you know, because I was going to preach a little bit on the children of prophecy this morning and the next one I took out had a crab on it and I thought, well, that might be true, too. I'm getting to be a little crabby. So, but we distrust the God's goodnesses to us. Do you love them this morning? Amen. The things that we want to talk about this morning should make our hearts glad. We're going to listen to 22 minutes of a portion of the message, Invisible Union, and I hope you listen to it and and realize he's speaking about you. Amen. So it says in our scriptures here uh found um uh here in in Genesis, in the beginning God created the heavens and earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. Amen. And let's turn over to St. John and uh also read uh that scripture found there in St. John. Um and uh and that says in St. John, it says the same thing, but this is uh he's trying to uh John's trying to establish the same uh thought here. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. Amen. Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray. Amen. You may be seated this morning. You know, in our age, we're uh really privileged. I I don't think we understand the privilege of our election the way that we should. You know, Paul even wrote it early in in the book of Romans when he began to uh uh speak. He said, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated, the children not yet being born, &gt;&gt; having neither done any good nor evil, but it was that the law of election might stand." And uh so we know without faith it's impossible to please God. So you know uh if if God tells you something, he wants you to know it's for you and he wants you to believe it. &gt;&gt; You know, he he doesn't want you to try to figure it out. He he didn't even require that you understand it. He said he wanted you to believe it on the basis that he spoke it. &gt;&gt; That's what simple faith does. [snorts] If it's very simple, it's if God said so, then that settles it. That it doesn't have to be placed. It doesn't have to be reasoned out. It it has to be uh it has to be accepted. And so I I wrote this little uh thought here that the children of prophecy because prophecy is is to foretell a future event. So all the word of God is really prophecy. Uh in the beginning God said let there be light. And so then and he said let there be light and there was light. So he said, "Let there be." Or he prophesied of a future event. And then the light came and it says, "And there was light." And and so the light was the child of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; So you understand that. So when we say you're the children of prophecy, you you are the the result of what was spoken. &gt;&gt; So something had to be spoken and then when that thing was spoken, so the the the the word that was spoke, it it is the the event that's future told. And then when that event's fulfilled and becomes manifested then that becomes the child of the prophecy. and and so uh we understand that the scriptures begin to prophesy uh quite a few things for our day in the you know like you could read in Timothy and uh John 2:18 and Timothy 4 and3 and Peter 3 and and Matthew 24 uh through 20 you know in the last days perilous time shall come there shall be false prophets. Men shall be lovers of pleasure, you know, and all these things that were spoken of our day. And so we find ourselves in our day and we understand that we are the children of that prophecy. We are living in that day that was spoken. And so if you can see what was spoken and then you can and you can see that then you understand that you were placed here by God in this day for a purpose. And we might ask the question, why would God take his bride and put him in this a day that's the most evil, deceptive day there ever was? &gt;&gt; You know, that's quite a question, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I mean, now you I always look at myself and I think, you know, what would I have done? Well, I would have made it I would have just made it all roses. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I if I was going to put myself somewhere, you know, I would have said, "Okay, I'm going to predict my future." You know, I I would have no rain, no clouds, you know, just a beautiful lake, fishing, you know, like all the little fishies I got from the Sunday school kids. You know, everything would be beautiful. But it wouldn't it wouldn't develop any character in me. There would be nothing there to prove me. You know what I mean? To test me to show what I really was made out of. In fact, I would be characterless. So if I would I would create a world for myself where I wouldn't need have to have any character. I wouldn't have to have any strength. I wouldn't have to have any will. I wouldn't have to have any willpower. I I would just make it so, you know, I I would be really I'd be mush. &gt;&gt; I'd be nothing. But he did it for a purpose because he wanted to place us here because he chose us before the foundation of the world. and he elected us and he chose us to be the ones &gt;&gt; that would show Satan that this Eve was not like the other Eve. &gt;&gt; Now, that's quite a battle that we're that we're placed in because we come to that place and we begin to learn about it. And as he said in Christ, the mystery of God revealed. He became us that we might become him. &gt;&gt; Well, we find ourselves and we see that we're battling and we see that we're tempted and we see that the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. And these two are contrarian and and we know who we really are and we know all the weaknesses that we have and and we don't perceive ourselves &gt;&gt; as being like him. But then he speaks these words. It's given to the overcomer. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And then he comes back and preaches to us. The seed has the power to transform. So you are the children of the of the words that were spoken in our day. &gt;&gt; So if I I don't know how I could just express this the way that I would really love to express it, but there's the message we have for our day. It wouldn't work in any other age. &gt;&gt; You you understand? And so we're not preaching the gospel of another age. We're preaching since the seals were opened and this became a new book and and there was revelation that now could come forth in the age that we're living in. We are now going to receive prophecy that was never prophesied to any other age. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we have to understand we that we have to be the children of the prophecy that is spoken for our day. &gt;&gt; And he put you here because you are the children of the prophecy that's spoken. If I could say it this way, just like he said, "Let there be light." He said, "There's going to be a bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he makes that statement. &gt;&gt; He said, "If he said there would be a bride, then she is going to be there." &gt;&gt; Okay. What God's wanting us to do is believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You you you understand that that that's me. &gt;&gt; That's me. Like the little boy in the mirror. when he saw himself reflected in the mirror, he looked and he saw the actions and then he looked at that and he said, "That's me." &gt;&gt; Well, if we could understand that prophecy is the mirror that you can see where you are. &gt;&gt; You understand? So can can you look out and see that this is perilous times? &gt;&gt; Can you look out and see this is the as it was in the days as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom. And you look there and you say that's this I see that I see where I'm standing. I see what's going on. And then you hear the word of God. And so it's reflecting to you and then you can say that's me. I'm the child of that prophecy. I'm living in that age. I'm living in that time. &gt;&gt; And so you know you're at the end time. And then you hear a prophecy like, "Behold, before the great and dreadful day, I'll send you Elijah the prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers." And you see that you looked and you saw the pillar of fire. You heard the voice. You saw the works and and you recognize that. So you behold I send you, Elijah. Well, you're the you. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; I'm the child of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; I'm that prophecy. &gt;&gt; I'm that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you we begin to understand. So we have to be start believing I'm that Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm that elect lady. &gt;&gt; And then but if we if we look at the darkness then and we look at that then we're not looking at the prophecy. So we're not the children of sin. We're the children of what's spoken of us and we understand we'll transform into that if we believe it. So I wanted to play I I'm going to preach backwards this morning. I want to play 22 minutes out of the message invisible union and I want you to hear what the prophet of God says about you. Okay. What he says about you, &gt;&gt; who you are, where you were, what he did, &gt;&gt; and as he speaks these things, I hope in your heart you can say, he's speaking of me. Now, you you can look at at your flesh. You can look at your faults. You can look at your failures, but you don't want to be the children of that. I want to be the ch child of what he spoke &gt;&gt; because I know if he spoke it &gt;&gt; and I'm the child of that prophecy. I can believe with all my heart that that will come to pass in me. I will be an overcomer. I can look at the weakness in my flesh and say to Satan, "Satan, you've been binding me by this. You've been waring with me on this. I I have all these weaknesses, but the word of God said, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to be the child of that prophecy, &gt;&gt; because it was spoken of me, &gt;&gt; and I I am going to fulfill that part of what's spoken. And that you know I could you could every time you say those things our minds &gt;&gt; go to work &gt;&gt; because that's where the battle is. &gt;&gt; Okay. But we God what our faith is what God's trying to restore in us is if he said it &gt;&gt; it's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's just play with this 22 minutes. It's going to I if some of you have computers and phones and and uh things that uh you can uh read. So, we're going it's I think we're going to start at paragraph I think it's uh 218. Uh, is that right, Gary? Where where did I what? &gt;&gt; 219. &gt;&gt; 219. Oh, paragraph 219. And so he starts go this book. Let me give you three book messages that I would really recommend that you spend a little bit of time studying. Easter Seal, Rising of the Sun, and Invisible Union. [snorts] Those three messages are the description of who you are. [snorts] We [clears throat] Yeah. The acceptance of the prophecy is so important to the believer. It actually gives you something to fight your flesh with. &gt;&gt; It gives you something to overcome with. It gives you a promise that you can use as a sword against your enemy. And we know who's the our biggest enemy. We are. And our flesh wars against our spirit. And they're contrary to another. But let me read the first statement that he speaks here. He says, "The bride knows where she stands." And then he says, "She's very few." Well, don't count yourself out. Count yourself in. &gt;&gt; Count yourself in. Let's look at this prophecy [snorts] what he's saying and let us say that's me. &gt;&gt; I believe this. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I I I accept this. You can't look at your circumstance. You can't look at any of those things. Could you imagine light looking at the void and the darkness [snorts and laughter] and saying I can't overcome that. No, he said let there be light and there will be light. He and that light came out of darkness and void. He said let there be a bride &gt;&gt; and that bride comes out of darkness &gt;&gt; and void. He said, "Let there be a church." She's called out of false &gt;&gt; to truth. &gt;&gt; So the process is the same. God's always calls out. He He He reaches out. He speaks his word. So So when it says it's very few, look around. Look at this city. This is very few. &gt;&gt; This is extremely few. So, every one of you has a place at the table. So, and you know, I don't know how if our interpreters can keep up. Uh, but we just trust that that if you don't speak English this morning that somehow these words will get to you. But let's listen to our messenger, a true genuine prophet of God, speaking some words of life to us. And this morning, he's talking about you and you can go back and read. This is some wonderful things that we'll hear. So, let's just listen to 22 minutes uh right now of our our prophet messenger. Thank you. extension [snorts] very few. There won't be many say just a very very very few. You say well they said thousands yes but they've come up through the 2,000 years too on every age where come out every Luther's age and that group and then died off and they went denominated then Wesley and then come Pentecostals and so forth all the little out branches of Baptist Presbyterian Methodist Nazarine pilgrim holiness and so forth. See all those branched off from there like these. But you remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen that you find that before that green can ripen everything in that skull has to be dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; CAN'T YOU SEE WHERE WE'RE STANDING? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LIFE IS IN THE GRAIN AGAIN. WHAT IS IT? JUST EXACTLY LIKE THE SAME GRAIN that went in the ground. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus in the bride form. &gt;&gt; Same power. Same church, same thing, same word. The same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here. And all that life had come through here, picked up its people. Now it's forming up into a head for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Speaking on that tomorrow night or next night when the Lord willing. Well, you're separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things OF THE WORLD, BUT OF ETERNAL LIFE. That germ that was in you at the beginning found bound you. Now your old book is gone with your old union. Now your name in your old in your has been transferred. Now you say, "Do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness?" &gt;&gt; You stand perfectly before God. Now your name is now in the new book. Not the book of life, BUT THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; WHAT the lamb redeemed, not the old book of your natural union, but your new bride. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOUR NEW LIFE IS IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. YOUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Where your true eternal germ from the BEGINNING TAKES HOLD. NOW YOU'RE NOT ONLY FORGIVEN, BUT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; JUSTIFIED. Romans 5:1 said, YEAH. ROMANS 5:1 SAYS, "THEREFORE, BEING JUSTIFIED BY FAITH," LOOK UP the word. &gt;&gt; THE WORD DON'T mean forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word means justified. &gt;&gt; It don't mean you're forgiven. For instance, YOU HEARD I GOT DRUNK AND AND DONE SOME EVIL THINGS and everything. Then you come around and say to me, "You found out I didn't do them." Then you come around and say, "Brother Ram, I forgive you. Forgive me. I didn't do it at the first place." Now, if I did do IT, I'M GUILTY. BUT YOU COULD FORGIVE ME. And I wouldn't be guilty, BUT YET I'M NOT JUSTIFIED BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DONE IT. BUT THE WORD JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT EVEN REGARDED AT ALL. HOW'S IT DONE? IN GOD'S BOOK OF THE SEA OF FORGIP AND MARRIAGE IS DIVORCED AND DEAD IS NOT EVEN IN THE MEMORIES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You are justified. Therefore, being justified, it was accused. YOU WAS ACCUSED. YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE OLD UNIONS IN THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGETFULNESS. YOU WASN'T MARRIED TO IT to begin with. HE, THE BRIDEGROOM, BORE YOUR SHAME HIMSELF. FOR YOU IN YOUR PLACE. HE took your place. FOR YOU WERE PREDESTINATED FOR HIM [screaming] TO BE IN HIS BRIDE before the foundation OF THE WORLD. THE BIBLE SAID SO. &gt;&gt; You are THE PREDESTINATED SEED. HOW DID YOU COME TO DO THIS? YOU WERE DECEIVED INTO IT BY YOUR FIRST MARRIAGE TO YOUR ADULTEROUS PARENT, EVE. IT'S NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN. BY YOUR NATURAL BIRTH, YOU COME AFTER EVE who committed adultery. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's the REASON YOU WAS BORN IN ADULTERESS. YOU'RE A SINNER TO BEGIN WITH. &gt;&gt; That's right. You was deceived into it. YOU HAD NO NO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S YOUR FAULT. YOU NEVER DID IT BECAUSE THAT LITTLE GERM THAT WAS IN YOU WAS TO BE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. GOD PUT HER NAME IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. LIKE MY LITTLE EAGLE STORY, all of you heard it. a h old farmer set a an a hen one time. She didn't have enough h eggs to go under the hen. So then he found an eagle egg and he put it under. When the eagle was born is the funniest looking chicken them chickens ever seen. Little old eagle going along the hen go cluck cluck cluck cluck. Little eagle said, "I don't know how the thing sounds like but I'm following her anyhow." And they went out in the barnyard AND BEGIN TO SCRATCH THE MANURE PILES. And she said, "Cluck cluck cluck. This is good. This is good. You join ours." This is what &gt;&gt; now the little eagle, he couldn't eat that stuff. &gt;&gt; He just he just went along with the chicken because he didn't know. He didn't know what to do. And then she went out there and she get this and that and little eagle just he just had to stomach it. But he didn't know how to do it, but he seen all the CHICKENS DOING IT. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT. So one day the mother knowed that she had laid two eggs. So she began to hunt for that other one. &gt;&gt; Flying around searching like the great Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; One day flew over the barnyard that denomination. SHE LOOKED DOWN THERE AND SHE SEEN her baby. She screamed. It was the voice of something that ECHOED FROM THE INSIDE OF HIM. OH, that sounds right. Oh, a real predestinated born charm predestinated. GOD, HEAR THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S MUSIC TO HIM. HE KNOWS IT'S THE TRUTH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Start that denominational stuff. Anyhow, join us. Come go with us. We got a social party. We got this. We got It just didn't sound right to the little fella. She said, "Son, you don't belong in that group anyhow. You belong to me. You're mine." He said, "Mama, that sounds real. How am I going to get out?" Just make a jump. I'll catch you. &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do. The anointed word of God being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of God with the predestinated journey into him FOR THIS HOUR. HE'LL SEE GOD'S MESSAGE as sure as there's a God in heaven. &gt;&gt; Martin Luther saw it for his. Wesley saw it for his. The Pentecostal saw it for his. Now, what about you? &gt;&gt; They went into denomination. Here's the word condemning it. Tell you what we're to have today. And just exactly Malachi 4 and all these other promises for the hour. WHAT DO YOU SEE? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There we are. THE REAL GENUINE EAGLE'S SHIRT. &gt;&gt; MY SHEEP KNOW my voice is strange to not follow. &gt;&gt; Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were for ordained to a son of God. YOU WERE IN GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU'RE ONLY MANIFESTED IN THIS DAY FOR HIS HONOR AND GLORY. HOW CAN YOU DO IT WITHOUT HONORING HIS WORDS? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Which you are a part of that word by predestination because look the God is the word. You believe it? &gt;&gt; WELL THEN IF HE ALWAYS WAS THE WORD IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AND IF THE WORD WAS GOD THEN YOU WERE IN GOD. &gt;&gt; THE WORD THE PART THAT YOU'RE TO PLAY WAS IN GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; He seen you. He knew you. He predestinated you to it. Now I tell you just as that eagle recognized that voice. So does a a real BORNAG AGAIN CHRISTIAN RECOGNIZE THE VOICE OF God speaking through the word when to see it anointed AND A VINDICATED. LOOK HE LOOKED UP THERE HE DIDN'T SEE THIS OLD HEN CLUCK CLUCK AROUND HERE &gt;&gt; JOINING US AND GO over here and go to this and go to this AND THAT. HE SAW A BEING LIKE HE WANTED TO BE &gt;&gt; SAILING IN THE AIR SCREAMING FREE UP IN THE HIGHS ABOVE ALL THE CULTURES AND of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HE WANTED TO BE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS IN HIM TO BE THAT. AND A MAN THAT'S BORN OF GOD IS SON OF GOD HAS TO HAVE THE NATURE OF GOD. HE HAS TO BE LIKE GOD. HE HONORS GOD. HE'S PART OF THE WORD of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this last DAYS WHEN THIS BRIDE'S TAKING FORM JUST EXACTLY THE SAME POWER THAT HE WAS IN AT THE BEGINNING, COME UP THROUGH THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH AND COME OUT FOR THE BRIDE. HE CAN'T BE NOTHING ELSE BUT THAT. They ought to have seen them Jews in their days when they seen it manifested THERE BEFORE HIM AS A PROPHET SAID HE WAS. &gt;&gt; He said, "Search the scriptures. In them you think you HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. THEY ARE THEY THAT TESTIFY OF ME. &gt;&gt; IF I DO NOT THE WORKS OF MY FATHER, DON'T BELIEVE ME. &gt;&gt; BUT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME, DO THEM BELIEVE THE WORKS THAT I'VE DONE." &gt;&gt; They said, "Our fathers eat man in the wilderness for 40 years." WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT. HE SAID, "And there are everyone dead." &gt;&gt; That's eternally separated. AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERYONE DIES. THERE'S ONLY THREE. &gt;&gt; Two come out of a million. Two million. That's one in a million. &gt;&gt; When a uh an injection, the sperm from male and female, there's usually one egg fertile. There's one egg, one germ that's fertile. If you ever seen hybriding and cattle, notice there's a a million eggs. There's a million germs. And when they are discharged to come together to the womb, coming through the tube and into the womb, they meet. ONE OF THEM IS EGGS. A million eggs. A MILLION GERMS. THERE'S ONLY ONE EGG IN THERE FERTILE. THERE'S ONLY ONE GERM FERT ALIVE. &gt;&gt; You can watch them little cavs and BEAT AROUND THERE. A SPECK THAT YOU CAN PUT ON and match THEM. AND DEUS LIM'S listening in tonight and he remembers when we tuck them. He tucked me down and showed me how that worked. test tubes and put just the nut that you can put on the end of A MATCH. THERE WAS THOUSANDS OF LITTLE CAVS AND BULLS in there, BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN LIVE. &gt;&gt; Only one of them. &gt;&gt; And here's a big BALL OF THEM HERE. AND YOU'LL notice one will crawl out from among this one here, go right over the germ, come over here, and egg will come out from AMONG THESE OTHER EGGS over here. And they'll meet together. AND THE REST OF THEM DIE. &gt;&gt; YET THEY'RE ALIVE. BUT THEY DIE [screaming] BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING SOMEONE MADE THIS ONE FERTILE and ordained this one too. &gt;&gt; It's predestination, my brother. &gt;&gt; Sir, God has to determine where it's going to be boy or girl, redhead, blackhead, or whatever it is. IT'S DETERMINED BY GOD. &gt;&gt; MORE MYSTERY THAN A VIRGIN birth to me. But Lord, the rest OF THEM DIE. THERE WERE TWO MILLION PEOPLE COME OUT, SUNG, SHOUTED, DONE EVERYTHING, SPOKEN, NOT EVER SPOKE IN TONGUES, BUT THEY SHOUTED AND AND GIVE GOD GLORY AND DANCED UP AND DOWN THE SEA AND DONE EVERYTHING ALL THE REST OF THEM DID. BUT THERE WERE ONLY two went into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Caleb, Caleb and Joshua, &gt;&gt; only two. That's one out of a million. It's one out of a million in natural birth. Every one of them had the same blessing. Oh, you Pentecostals, I hope you don't wake up too late. ONE OUT OF A MILLION. LOOK, THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE 500 million so-called Christians in the WORLD TODAY. IF JESUS HAD COME, there'd only be 500 go with him. And if that statistic would run true, well, there's more than that missing every day over the world. &gt;&gt; They know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; I understand, said the scribes. You know that. Why the scribes say that that Elias must first come? They said to Jesus, he said, "Alias is already come and you didn't know it." &gt;&gt; He did just exactly what the scripture said to have. So must the son of man suffer under. They didn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; Yet they were all in the church, all claimed to be alive. You said, "A real bornagain Christian, a real servant of God. You're that word of God. He'll come right out through every denomination to that real fertile ground." what that bedding ground. He'll just do it. I don't know how he does it. God's ordained it to be done. You was deceived in the beginning by your first marriage. Now you know what's true. Just like I said the little eagle. When he heard the bridegroom's voice, he went to it. The anointed vindicated word of God for THE LAST DAYS. NOAH WAS A VINDICATED WORD FOR his day. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; WELL, his message won't work today. &gt;&gt; Moses was the vindicated word of his days. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It won't work for now. &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS JOHN WAS THE VINDICATED. YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; It wouldn't work in the days of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Certainly not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Law and prophets were until John sent in the kingdom of heaven. The apostles, them who set forth THE BIBLE. HERE COME LUTHER OUT IN REFORMATION. His words that his church won't work today. &gt;&gt; Wesley's won't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pentecostals won't. They worked in their day, but it's another day. This is the opening of the seven seals. I know it sounds strange to you, but God has vindicated so perfectly. There's no no question in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just perfectly. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I ain't scattering that to the local assembly here. I'm speaking to the people out across the nation. See, do what you wish to. Now, notice the anointed word of his days of which you are a part by predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. You immediately like knew when you heard that, YOU KNEW RIGHT QUICK THAT you was an eagle. &gt;&gt; You also realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with. &gt;&gt; You know there's something wrong there. There's something wrong. That's right. For you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning. He the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in a sea of forgiveness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. Your first husband that you were married to the world, the anointed bridegroom which forained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church. &gt;&gt; That don't sound right, does it? &gt;&gt; You might find that in the alman, but not in God's Bible. by the washing of the water by the word and the word thing. Father, you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning. This is my message to the church now as you as we go off the air just in a minute. YOU ARE STANDING IF you're standing ON GOD'S WORD AND WITH GOD'S WORD, EVERY AMEN EVER JOT, ever title. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are you standing? I'm trying to tell you, PULL AWAY FROM THEM SHUCKS AND GET OUT here in the wheat &gt;&gt; before you can get right before the sun. I hear the coming of the combine. &gt;&gt; You're standing COMPLETE JUSTIFIED LIKE YOU NEVER DID IT in the first place. HALLELUJAH. TALK ABOUT A THANKSGIVING. I feel real good. I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of. &gt;&gt; You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. EVERY MAN AND WOMAN THAT'S BORN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST AND BELIEVES EVERY WORD OF GOD STANDS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER sinned at the first place. &gt;&gt; You're perfect. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. HOW CAN YOU IF A MAN IF I SUPPOSED TO DIE IN THE MORNING, A MAN TOOK MY PLACE? I CANNOT DIE FOR that sin. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY TOOK MY PLACE. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS THE WORD TOOK MY PLACE. HE BECOME ME THAT a sinner THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM THE WORD. AMEN. LET ME HOLD TRUE TO IT. &gt;&gt; Not the church, the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, THAT SPIRITUAL UNION OF CHRIST IN HIS CHURCH. NOW, WHEN THE FLESH IS becoming word and the word becoming flesh, &gt;&gt; MANIFESTED, VINDICATED, JUST WHAT THE BIBLE SAID WOULD HAPPEN in this day. IT'S HAPPENING &gt;&gt; DAY BY DAY. WHY IT'S ACCUMULATING SO FAST OUT THERE THOSE DESERTS AND THINGS TAKING PLACE THAT I COULDN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH IT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NEAR THE COMING OF JESUS TO BE UNITED WITH HIS CHURCH WHERE THE WORD BECOMES THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Call of the Holy Spirit searching the heart. You're standing completely. You never sinned in the first place. God don't even know that IT'S IN THE SEA OF FORGIVENESS. You never did it. YOU WERE ACCUSED OF IT BY THE ACCUSER, BUT REALLY FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU WERE PREDESTINATED TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF [screaming] GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STANDING THERE WASHED AND YOUR OLD BOOK OF DIVORCEMENT'S PUT AWAY AND IT'S DEAD. ABSOLUTELY OUT OF EXISTENCE. EVEN IN THE MIND OF GOD, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF CHRIST, &gt;&gt; WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; PRECIOUS, VIRTUOUS, sinless son of God, standing with a pure, unadulterated bride, word that he washed by the water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that HE MIGHT TAKE YOU which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning AS SAME AS HE WAS. HE WAS THAT GREAT ATTRIBUTE OF GOD called love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU ARE, YOU'RE A SERVICE OF GOD. WHATEVER GOD WANTS YOU TO DO, WHERE YOUR PLACE IS, GOD PLACED IN THE CHURCH. SOME APOSTLES, PROPHETS, TEACHERS, PASTORS, he placed that by virtue of his own predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND YOU WERE THAT TO BEGIN WITH. YOUR FIRST WEDDING WAS ANAL. IT WAS YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IF ONLY ONE THING COULD DO IT, THAT WOULD BE GOD COME DOWN HIMSELF AND TOOK YOUR PLACE &gt;&gt; IN THE FORM OF THE SON OF GOD, JESUS CHRIST, AND WASHED YOU BY THE WATER. THE WASHING OF THE WATER BY THE WORD, the word, not the denomination. &gt;&gt; THE WORD [screaming] WASHED YOU, &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU WON'T STAND IN THE WATER OF THE WORD, HOW YOU GOING TO BE WASHED? YOU'RE STILL AS SPOTTED AS EVE WAS. &gt;&gt; OH, DEAR DYING LAMB, THY PRECIOUS BLOOD SHALL NEVER LOSE ITS POWER. ALL THE RANSOM CHURCH OF GOD BE SAVED TO SIN ANYMORE. WHAT IS SIN? Sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; UNBELIEF IN WHAT? THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Unbelief in God, which is the word, pure, unadulterated. OH, HALLELUJAH. LEAVING SOON FOR THE SKIES. AMEN. Standing ready. Thank your garments WASHED FOR THE WATER OF THE BLEEDING WORD. The word becomes blood. &gt;&gt; The word bled for you and your washed and bleeding word. The word bleeding. the life of God in the word. And the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these uh prostitutes &gt;&gt; and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word that make your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word. &gt;&gt; NOW, HOW YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE THAT GOD COMES DOWN AND VINDICATES it &gt;&gt; and proves you say, "Well, I didn't believe it that way." They didn't believe it Jesus' way, &gt;&gt; but God proved it. They didn't believe it Noah's way. THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT MOSES' WAY. They were willing to take Balam's word part. We're all the same. So, LET'S JUST ASSOCIATE TOGETHER. SEPARATE YOURSELF, the Bible says, from unbelief. Hallelujah. Now, NOTICE YOU'RE NOT ONLY THAT, but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmmerited grace. &gt;&gt; A wedding band OF GRACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNMMERITED OF YOUR OWN. GOD DID IT HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band on you there. &gt;&gt; Put your name on the book. What a thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise our God. &gt;&gt; In closing, I might say this. We all know that the modern church Pentecostal in its present condition, all the denominations together, I throw them all in one bundle because they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember he's going to bundle the weeds first and burn them. take the he takes all the wheat stalks and burn it all up first and they take come to get this wheat and takes it home. They're all gathering in a bundle bundle of Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals all going to ecumenical counseling. &gt;&gt; That's right. They're all burned. See, we all know that the modern church in its present condition and its present state is IN NO CONDITION TO FINISH UP THE GREAT COMMISSION THAT GOD GAVE THE church for this day. &gt;&gt; How many Pentecostals going to say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in we're on one toness threeness this that other fight. One's this and one's that and THE OTHER. AND EVERY ONE OF THEM afraid to face the word right down to their &gt;&gt; they know you tell them about they say I I can't help it. I can't believe that. I don't care what he does. I &gt;&gt; see. See shows what mammy and papy you have. &gt;&gt; You might be a state president or someday you might be this that the other. You better be a son of God. Now, we know that the church could not the Pentecostal church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in its present condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could it? No. &gt;&gt; Well, it can't even agree on one or two words in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you going to do it? It can't do it. So, you see, denomination's out. That's &gt;&gt; right. It's going to be a elected people that's elected for it. Did anybody see yourself? &gt;&gt; Now that's worth going back and reading. &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; You're In other words, you were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, came into the world speaking lies. that came because of the union of your parents. You picked that nature up from that thing. But that wasn't the real you. That wasn't you. &gt;&gt; You were something else. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You were you were in God's mind in the beginning. You already had the wedding band of predestination on your finger. You were predestinated &gt;&gt; to be the son and daughter of God. You were predestinated to be the bride. &gt;&gt; Now, if you could sit back and say, "I'm the child of that prophecy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, that empowers you, &gt;&gt; you still have to fight the fight, &gt;&gt; but now you know you have the bloody bleeding word of the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you can apply to that nature. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, one of them's going to have to rule, [snorts] &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so, it's by what? That we overcome? By faith. &gt;&gt; Faith. I believe what he said. That's what he wanted to restore back to this day. Now you understand that that message uh another message won't work. &gt;&gt; He said it wouldn't fulfill the commission of this day. what's in the church world, what they're preaching, what they're saying, it won't fulfill the commission of this day to get the bride in the position where she belongs, her predestinated state. It takes the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, what he's trying to do is he's trying to reveal to you who you are because according to God's plan, he if he wants to fulfill a prophecy, he's got to predestinate the child of that prophecy to be there in order that he can use that predestinated seed to be the child of the pro prophecy. and fulfill it. &gt;&gt; See, the only way you'll ever get to quit looking back &gt;&gt; is to look at the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your miserable self. It don't matter. [snorts] What did he say? &gt;&gt; What's prophesied of me? That prophecy must come to pass. I believe it. Do you see what he said? He said, "Jump. I'll catch you. How do I get there? I'm in this chicken pen. I'm in this flesh. I've got all these problems. I've done all these things. I've got all this misery. old husband, old flesh, and then someone comes and says, "That's not laid to your charge." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness where God doesn't even remember it. &gt;&gt; I know brother Bram spoke a little bit fast in some of these places. It would maybe it would behoove me to go back and start, you know, just going through every bit line by line by line so you hear it. But you've got the ability to do that. &gt;&gt; Go do it. &gt;&gt; Do you like it when he says you stand completely justified like you never did it in the first place? &gt;&gt; He said to the believer that's music to his ear. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; But if you keep doubting yourself, &gt;&gt; and you don't accept your election, you don't accept your position, you don't accept your place, you don't realize that you were put here, he planned it through your great greatgrandfather, your your grandmother and everything. He brought all those people all together, all down to time to put you here now. to put you in a position. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the commission. &gt;&gt; What time is it? It's 11. Is it 11:30? 11:39. Can I I'll just I'll finish up just here in a second. &gt;&gt; There's a bride. &gt;&gt; Do you accept that? Now, I can't I can't school that into you. &gt;&gt; Did you know that the prophet of God said it can't be schooled? Only God can put that in you. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But I hope this morning, no matter how little you think of yourself, that you will think of God's word being greater. &gt;&gt; That little germ that was predestinated you in you before the foundation of the world found you. [snorts] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you can sit there and say, "I've done all these things. I've I've failed. I in my life, you know what I mean? I was involved in relationships that were wrong. I used drugs. I drank. I did all these things. All that stuff, all that muck and mud, right? &gt;&gt; But that little lily seed &gt;&gt; that was in you before the foundation of the world, finally you something in you says there's something in me. Now that something in you begins to work its way up through the mud, through the muck, is pushing. It's like the little blade of grass under the concrete. It's calling. It's drawing. That's the whole revelation and thinking man's filter. It'll draw you through the filter of the word until all THAT STUFF IS OFF OF YOU. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; If you lay in the sun, it'll all come off of you. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But you've got to believe that seed in you has the power in it to transform you into what it was predestinated to be. &gt;&gt; God's power to transform. &gt;&gt; God's transforming power. All those messages are all given to you, his bride. The restoration of Eden, back to Eden. If we could just start standing up, no matter how great our weakness is, and start resisting the devil, he'll start fleeing. But if not, why look into the grave you've come out of? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I can't do nothing about yesterday, &gt;&gt; but I believe there's a prophecy that I'm a child of. He said that I'd be spotless and perfect and well. &gt;&gt; You know, healing is a prophecy. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You're sick. Don't say, "Oh, I don't have cancer. Oh, I'm not sick." Prophet of God said, "Yeah, you're sick. &gt;&gt; You're sick." But it was prophesied that I'd be well. &gt;&gt; Because by his stripes I was healed. &gt;&gt; So when he when he did his stripes, he was saying, "Let there be healing. It was prophecy. &gt;&gt; It was telling of a future event. &gt;&gt; You can't be healed unless you're sick. &gt;&gt; But the healing is the future event or the condition that this sick body will be in. &gt;&gt; So what am I going to do? Look at the darkness, the sickness, or am I going to look at the prophecy? And he said, "If [clears throat] you see the prophecy, then you you see a well man &gt;&gt; and you start walking to it." &gt;&gt; If you're sin sick, &gt;&gt; then you see a well sinless person &gt;&gt; and you start walking to it. You start washing yourself &gt;&gt; by the water of the word, &gt;&gt; saying, "I never did this in the first place. I was tricked into this. This is not my true nature. My name's written on the Lamb's book of life. I'm called and elected to BE A BRIDE. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PROPHECY TO PUSH YOU FORWARD. You got to understand [snorts] he knew all that we would be in our condition we'd be in. &gt;&gt; But yet by election &gt;&gt; he chose me. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; Paul even said I'm the chiefest of sinners. Paul, but he regarded that he who was in him was greater than he who was in the world. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to close with this for you got put your spiritual thinking cap on from rising of the sun. That's the divine revelation. This is paragraph 168. That's the divine revelation of the word made flesh, right? Who do men say that I am? Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. The revelation, the divine revelation that the word was made flesh. What did we just hear? The flesh was made word. Now the word has been made flesh, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The word that was in you from the beginning is now being made flesh. &gt;&gt; What? This old thing, that little thing in you, that word that's in you now is starting to become &gt;&gt; flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He became you that you might beame him. &gt;&gt; It's not this instant one wave. Okay. So he said divine revelation of the word made flesh. If it was flesh in the day by the son, the groom, it's the flesh today by the bride. &gt;&gt; That's prophecy to me. &gt;&gt; That's the word. &gt;&gt; And the word cannot fail. &gt;&gt; It will be. I've just got to stand up and start saying that's me. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; That word is going to be made flesh in me. &gt;&gt; Someone says, "Well, I don't see it." Well, that don't matter whether you see it. I don't even see it in myself. I see the lily pond. I see the muck that I'm traveling through. But the seed sees the lily &gt;&gt; that it's going to become. The eagle was in the chicken yard eating all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; But it saw something in the word that it wanted to become. That's really what it wanted to be. Let me ask you this. Don't in your heart, do you really want to be the sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; That answer in you is yes. Got to have faith in your election. &gt;&gt; Because if you look around, that's all that Satan wants to do is accuse you. &gt;&gt; It don't matter. You say, "Well, I did this yesterday." There's blood. &gt;&gt; If you confess it, he's just in faithful to forgive it. continue on your journey. He said it's made flesh today and the bride. See, now listen. See, so now he's gonna tie this together. He says, see, whoseever sins you remit, to them they are remitted. Whoseever sins you retain, to them they are retained. See that? That was in uh Matthew the 16th chapter I believe. He he he spoke these things. Was it 16:16 or or Mark I think. Yeah. You know and the scripture says that he breathed on them and they received the Holy Ghost. Whoseever sins you shall remit they they are remitted. And and so he makes this statement. Now listen what he says. And now the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to their priest. But that's carnal. Now, Brother Brandham just said, "How can I forgive you if I never did it in the first place?" So the remittance of sin wasn't the priest saying, "I forgive you." &gt;&gt; It wasn't somebody confessing a sin and saying, "I forgive you. &gt;&gt; I forgive you. Oh, you were I Oh, I was so bad. I done this. Okay, I forgive you." Well, you know what you're going to do with that? you're going to sin again. &gt;&gt; So he says that wasn't the whose sins you retain and whose sins you don't. It was he said, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel and them that believe." See if I can find that scripture. I don't know. I want this that scripture where he says, "And he breathed on them and they received the Holy Ghost." Is that in John? Yeah, I think it's right here. He said, "No, that's not it." Oh, well. &gt;&gt; What? John 20. Yeah. John 20 and 23. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. That's what it is. Let's just read that. Turn there for a second with me. He said, "And Jesus said unto them, peace be unto you. As my father hath sent me, so I send you." Now stay with me here. And he and he said this, he breathed on them on on them, receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whoseever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them. And whoseever sins you retain, they are retained. Now, the Catholic Church grabbed that. But that's not what it was. Look at what he said. Watch. It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How do you remit sins? &gt;&gt; By the spiritual revealed word &gt;&gt; not forgiven but throwed in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's the commission. You understand? That's what he said. He said that's a commission. Go into all the world, baptize him in the name of the father, son. Whoseever sins you remit. In other words, he said, "Preach the gospel. Them that believe shall be saved. Them that believe not shall be lost." &gt;&gt; So when the gospel IS, YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Now that if you believe that, &gt;&gt; you're saved. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, you're lost. &gt;&gt; That's the remittance of sin. &gt;&gt; THE SPIRITUAL revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; HOW do you remit their sins? By preaching them the revealed word of the hour. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Remitted, &gt;&gt; done away with &gt;&gt; justified. &gt;&gt; Throw it in the sea of God for God don't even remember it. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if you believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe it. Those sins aren't going to haunt you. If your past is still haunting you, may I pray that you get the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; That's what remits sin. &gt;&gt; That's what wipes the sin out of your life. That's what lets you know nothing is charged to God's elect &gt;&gt; because the seed of God remains in them. &gt;&gt; Listen how he ties this in. He says it's a spiritual revealed word that did it. So here I am in this day. I just played you. Like I said I preached this backwards. I just played you the word that remitted your sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did you believe it? say that's me &gt;&gt; that was the rem those whose sins are retained. In other words, if you don't accept that gospel, you are retaining &gt;&gt; or keeping your sins. &gt;&gt; And if you keep calling yourself a sinner, &gt;&gt; you will be a sinner. BUT WHY DON'T YOU PROPHESY ABOUT YOURSELF &gt;&gt; and become the children of your own prophecy? &gt;&gt; I'M AN OVERCOMER. I'M AN OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; Then listen what he says. Ties it perfectly together. He says, "Watch this. The spiritual revealed word that did it." That's the reason he told them to go baptize in the name of the father, son, holy ghost. He knew they knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did they know? They knew he was the sacrifice for their sins. &gt;&gt; He knew they were clean, &gt;&gt; justified. by faith. &gt;&gt; It's our faith that justifies it. &gt;&gt; It's hard when you got a rotten record. Because Satan does not want you to let go of that record because that's the only hold &gt;&gt; he has on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But if you can accept the word [snorts] &gt;&gt; of life, &gt;&gt; what Jesus did in his day for the Jews, God veiling himself in the prophet messenger did the same things for the Gentiles. You just heard him say it. Denominational doctrine and teaching cannot meet the challenge of this age. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is the revealed word to you &gt;&gt; that remits &gt;&gt; your sins. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's by the revelation of the word. The Catholic priests got a hold of it. There's a lot of preachers that are still forgiving the sins of their people and making them bound to them and making you feel guilty. And &gt;&gt; let's forget that stuff. There's no big eyes, &gt;&gt; little you. &gt;&gt; The same message that set me free sets you free. &gt;&gt; Do you understand &gt;&gt; that this message sets you free &gt;&gt; from the old nature? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's why he tells the story about Johnny Crow, &gt;&gt; the bird that was tied with a string &gt;&gt; for so long &gt;&gt; and he kept hearing the gospel fly free. We're going south and then a farmer felt sorry for him. Cut the string. &gt;&gt; But he was so used of only going so far spiritually. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He was only used to going so far until the string of the flesh grabbed a hold of him. The string of his past grabbed a hold of him. The string of the memory of all the things that he did grabbed a hold of him. HE COULDN'T FLOP. HE COULDN'T FLY. HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS FREE. &gt;&gt; Same thing. [crying] He's binding us with memory. &gt;&gt; He's binding us with our past. [snorts] But the prophecy, the prophecy said we'd be without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophecy said none of it would be late to our charge. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The prophecy said he paid for it &gt;&gt; that I could walk into it. &gt;&gt; The commission, the commission is to go into all the world &gt;&gt; and tell them that their sins have been remitted. We've built our faith on the past. [snorts] Our faith is built because we believe Brother Brandham is a prophet. We believe he did this. He believed he did that. And we look back at the history and say, "I believe that." That's just like me saying George Washington crossed the Delaware. Abraham Lincoln. [snorts] We're not living in the day of that prophecy. There was children that lived in that day. We're living in the day of the fulfillment of what he spoke. &gt;&gt; It's not me believing who he was &gt;&gt; that gives me faith. &gt;&gt; It's me believing what he said. that gives me faith. &gt;&gt; If you take those message, if you would take this just what we heard this morning and you will understand it's the revealed word that forgives your sins, not penance. &gt;&gt; That was the Catholic priest. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the revealed word. He said it, &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; If he said they're forgiven, &gt;&gt; I believe it. If they He said they were in God's forgetfulness, I believe it. If he said my name was written on the Lamb's book of life, I believe it. If he said the wedding band of predestination was put on me before the foundation of the world and my name was put in a book, I believe it. If he said nothing can put it on and nothing can take it off, I believe it. If he said that I would become word, I believe it. If he said I can become like he was, I believe it. It don't matter where I am. It's the prophecy that's spoken of me &gt;&gt; that I believe. &gt;&gt; Lord, richly bless you this morning. I'll tell you that ought to make you shout. &gt;&gt; That ought to make you happy. Uh if you I'd go back and read it again and and tell you have say God reveal this to me that I am not a chicken &gt;&gt; and quit looking at your flesh. &gt;&gt; God don't like your flesh anyway. &gt;&gt; That's why he's giving you a new body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you imagine what we have &gt;&gt; to bring to people? [snorts] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about bringing the fulfillment of all these prophecies. You tell people what the prophet of God said, &gt;&gt; they will. Oh, he said if that's in him, &gt;&gt; it's music to his ear. We just read it. Every predestinated son that hears the message of the hour, they come to life. &gt;&gt; Let us move towards the commission. &gt;&gt; Let us move to sharing this message. Let us move to where we're really trying to turn our hearts and where we're trying to get our church to be. Not dwelling on ourselves, &gt;&gt; but dwelling on the victory of God's word. Communion tonight. &gt;&gt; You believe in communion? &gt;&gt; Then make every effort. Everybody that's in here tonight should come back for communion &gt;&gt; if you believe God's word. &gt;&gt; Brother Sergio is going to share what's on his heart with us tonight. Won't be long. We'll be right into communion. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; But that's your heritage. &gt;&gt; That's your testimony. &gt;&gt; I take communion because I believe everything the prophet of God said &gt;&gt; about me. Don't don't don't deprive yourself. Don't look at yourself. Look at what he said about you. &gt;&gt; If you're not well, then walk in to the well man. walk into the son of God that was prophesied about you. God bless you. Pray for sister Lesie. She's homesick and she don't miss church, you know, so she's not feeling well. And Matthew's uh uh preaching in uh Oklahoma and Davey went up with them and [snorts] and uh so I don't have any of my family here, I think, except for Sharon. And she said, "Dad, I'm all alone. I don't have none of my family with me. I said, "Well, you can sit on the platform with me if you want." &gt;&gt; But do you love him? &gt;&gt; Why do you love him? &gt;&gt; Cuz he first loved you. &gt;&gt; When did he love you? &gt;&gt; Before the world was ever formed. &gt;&gt; Who are you? I'm the predestinated bride of Jesus Christ. Musicians, if you would come, God bless you. Brother Billy, if you'd lead us in a little worship and go forward. You let's stand together and and uh let's just have a word of prayer. And I'm going to pray this prayer. And if you agree as I pray, you lift your hand to him. Our gracious heavenly father, the messenger of our age told us to pray for revelation. That there was nothing greater than divine revelation. That the church was built not on history but on revelation. Our prophet of God just spoke to us. He said, "I I believe that more than anything else." I love that revelation, Father. The revealed word that we were in your thinking that you knew me before I came here. And even though I came here in the marriage of my human nature, I was trapped into it. I didn't have a choice. My mother and father born me and I got their human nature and I came into the world speaking lies. But father, you didn't lay that to my [music] charge because you had already before the world begun [music] predestinated me to be a son and daughter of God and be a part of your bride. You had already prophesied that I would be [music] part of your body. And Lord, I'm raising my hand and asking, Father, would you make that such a reality to me that I could share it with other people? that I could preach it, Father, that one might hear the revealed word of the hour. And they would come to the revelation of the word and they would realize that all of their sins [music] and their record and their history and their nature was thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness, never to be remembered. [music] and they could walk out free. He breathed on them and they received the Holy Ghost. Father, may we receive your word. The Holy Spirit of our hour is a revealed word of God. We ask you to bless each one. I pray for our young people that they could see the world and say, "Father, I'm not that. I'm not I'm not a nightclub person. I'm not a ball game person. I'm not a a a video game person. I'm not filled with lust. I'm tempted, Father. But through you, I can overcome [music] &gt;&gt; and they'll believe. Father, I pray that they understand [music] that this revealed word was the remission of their sins. [music] If they believed it, we are what we believe. We ask it in Jesus' [music] name. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. [music] The [music] victory by the he [music] oh my [singing] life is no longer mine. [music] I will praise you of God and I [music] to [singing] praise [music] his name.

We can say this morning that the case has been dismissed &gt;&gt; for he has not enough evidence to claim us. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is here which was left with us &gt;&gt; to witness that we are of God. &gt;&gt; We are going back where we coming from. &gt;&gt; Father we thank you for the way this morning.
