Description:
My Will Or God's Will
Br. George Smith
Sunday Evening Service: November 21, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

open our bibles to psalm 143 it's good to be back in the house of the lord everybody had a good rest and um we're ready to worship the lord and we're going to stay awake aren't we silas psalm 143 and verse 8. see what the lord has for us here cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee deliver me o lord for mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant okay a few pages over to psalm i mean to a proverbs 14 proverbs 14 again we're dealing with god's speaking to us there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end of their the end thereof are the ways of death it might look good to you it might not be good now over here towards the end of the old testament in the book of jonah jonah is right before micah okay jonah chapter one tonight we're speaking on a subject my will or god's will something every one of us got to face when we wake up in the morning am i going to go god's way am i going to go my way jonah chapter 1 now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amitai saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me heavenly father thank you for your word thank you lord for your your obedient prophets of the past who have just said what you said and now we're here to remind people and to gather strength for our journey help us in jesus name amen you may be seated now tonight we're going to speak out of brother branham's absolute fair enough now my ideas absolute now jonah was an israelite now you all knew that but we're here to remind you jonah was israelite he lived in a little town called geth hepper it's uh just north of nazareth up in galilee and he was the first foreign missionary a missionary is an apostle one that is sent and according to brother branham it's the highest calling in the scripture in ephesians 4 first apostles prophets and so forth elijah says in the end time 1954 i believe every christian is obligated not so much that you have to go over to the old country and preach but if you can't go help some help send somebody that can go real simple math don't have to wonder what it means everybody should hear the gospel at least once i want to do my part there's just something about missionary work that i just love it and just to know what you're doing you're doing god's will when you're giving to missions so we want to say what he says these are some of his words so missionary work is not only you know traveling to some foreign place where it's hot and there's bugs and all those things maybe they don't speak your language but missionary work is living for others right here you know everybody all your neighbors are watching you we're going through crisis after crisis after crisis and you still have a smile you still have a clean face you still you know seem to have gas for your car they're watching these things you see and so everybody wants eternal life or everybody wants to go to heaven right no if you take a poll tomorrow the people you work with well sure everybody wants to go to heaven they just don't want to go today okay yeah because no one wants to die and face eternal separation from god and from everybody else so i know that you all are you've always been interested in missionary work you've send missionaries you've helped me and different things and even today i collected some clothes that are going to go to venezuela okay we're going to talk about that in a minute but um brother branham says over here on that day on calvary he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you and me now what must we do the first thing i want to say jesus never lived for himself okay he lived for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good and all that's good but when you live your life just to yourself you're not showing eternal life okay life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it came as the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day on calvary and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others so before we get too far into this we just want to uh dwell on this on the foreign missions for a minute because that's that's what um jonah was he was the first foreign missionary god gave him these instructions and we're going to get into that whether he you know if it's god's will or if it's our will we have a choice every day we live in america we've got choices so far and um if you noticed over in our study in the book of acts when we were in chapter 11 there were some needs in jerusalem so paul and silas and them they were over in the church in antioch and they collected an offering and put it in the hands of the missionaries and they took missionary aid to the people in jerusalem and um so every every two weeks we're sending money we're sending clothes we're sending toothpaste and all kinds of things to the saints in a certain area of venezuela now not everybody's starving but some are going through very bad times what you read about it which you see on on the news it's much worse than that because they're kind of giving us the rosy picture but it's very very bad and so we're sending them church age books and different things now they they don't have any way that you can just send stuff in like books from another country we have an angle that we can send stuff because a pastor i knew years ago he's passed on now but his son operates a a shipping company in miami so i put the stuff in a you know ups goes to him then he puts it in a boat and his son operates the other end in venezuela to receive it and then it is dispersed to the believers so it works just fine now another thing is that over five million people have escaped from venezuela we got one sitting right here and they they couldn't take it no more there's nothing to eat there's no job there's no nothing so they left 5 million now they get to these other countries such as ecuador and peru and colombia and different places they want to they want to send some money home well guess what they don't have any they don't have any western union no everything americans cut off except for the money they love the dollars so they send me western union money then i go over and put it in a bank and then have an automatic transfer to a friend who in venezuela who has an american bank account and he pays it out sounds like money laundering did it well that's exactly what it is we have to get it to him you know and um and so you know the book of acts is the only book that's not finished in the bible we're it's still going on all the things you see in the book of acts it's happening today um we're also helping build this church over in malawi i don't know if i've told you about that last time but these people got thrown out of their church they had a nice church but the man that donated the property some evil spirit got into me well i want my property back all you guys don't agree with me stay out anyway so here's all these people meeting under a tree and they wrote and they said now we've got a certain amount of money saved up to buy property to you know continue but we need a little more so they need about a thousand dollars well while i'm collecting the thousand dollars the property gets sold to the catholic church and i told don't worry god's got something better for you so sure enough they go out of town and they found a nice piece a couple acres and um they um they started you know digging it by hand no machinery they go about the size of this church there probably and all the digging and everything by hand so we've been helping them so as they go along they said wow this is going to be good we'll call this the george smith tabernacle so i don't think so we're going to call this walking in the light tabernacle they're they're almost finished with that and um and like the the church age book we've been printing that you know in this country but then we see the big need overseas so we've been printing thousands in china distributing to uh the spanish-speaking countries now to the english-speaking countries and um it's it's the book that just tells the whole story if you if they took everything else away you had your bible in church age book you'd you'd pretty much have what brother brahm said you know uh and i also noticed going through the book of acts nobody was out there telling everybody you know they weren't preaching yeah jesus said jesus said no their message was all these scriptures that you all memorized all these years here's the fulfillment that was their message and that's what we're doing today god has sent a restoration prophet now here's what he said so we're busy with all this going on and um so that's pretty much our missionary report but you see we have joan over here our brother jonah he had a direct commission from god go preach to the enemy their wickedness has come up before me i can't stand it anymore you go preach to him there's only one problem jonah was jewish and the people of nineveh were gentiles very serious segregation now nineveh was the capital of assyria you can look at your maps later not now and um it was the capital of um assyria which is currently northern iraq a very wicked sinful people very cruel violent city of over 120 000 people and at the time it was a large city it took three days to walk around it the assyrians up there you know in nineveh were constantly tormenting and oppressing the israelites yeah they didn't start in your lifetimes 3 000 years ago they were oppressing israelites you know it's been going on for years so god was sending his prophet right into the jaws of danger to face the enemy go cry against it it was time for repentance okay and so warning before judgment and don't be falling asleep because i got my friend here i'm watching you and so um god always sends warning before judgment when jesus was here he walked through israel sometimes he wrote a donkey but mostly walked and he performed miracles everywhere preaching people were being healed and so forth but there was three towns that just couldn't get it they just wouldn't believe they wouldn't pay attention now we have uh bethsaida quarazim and capernaum brother brahm talks about these many times it's in the scripture and so he cursed them and next day everything went on as normal 60 years later the earthquake came and destroyed those cities now since israel has become a nation they have restored every town and village everything's back the way it was originally except for those three villages nothing is there because jesus cursed them it's a pile of rocks nothing more there's a few people in capernaum because the catholic church owns it and they've made a tourist thing out of it that's fine but you see when brother branham preached the choosing of a bride which is one of the original tapes that your pastor heard and left california that was april of 1965. and brother branham said it's gonna be a piece three to four hundred three hundred to four hundred miles wide fifteen hundred miles long now when that goes into the ocean there's no repair there's no fema there's no washington there's no nothing it's the end that wave is going to go around the world okay so um why is that important to us over here man we're safe here in dallas there's no river there's no nothing well guess what your world's fixing to get turned upside down all this nice stuff it's going to disappear pretty soon and over in first corinthians paul said all these things happen to them for examples and are written for our admonition upon whom upon whom the ends of the world have come that's us that wasn't then that's written for laodicea you see we are the end time generation the end of the ages is at the door so the world has fallen apart in case you haven't noticed it's falling apart there's no way out of this credit problem we have we can't print enough money now they're going to burn things now they're going to steal things out of the stores there's no going back you see and jesus said this is coming he said when you see this coming in luke 21 28 when these things begin to happen look up your redemption is drawing nigh he didn't tell us to vote in the right people he didn't tell us to make some more money to try to fix it no just forget it look up we're leaving okay so once again we have a message of warning before judgment now back there in capernaum in those days 60 years went by in the earthquake and destroyed those those towns and today pile of rocks one interesting thing along that same line when i used to travel to south america got there one day and they were having like a youth camp and so this one girl comes up and says oh brother george i need prayer and what's wrong well you know my house everything's going wrong and she had all kinds of problems and i knew that her name was bethsaida well bible name but you know there's bible names you don't want to put on your kids right nobody calls your child ananias or sapphira you know and so i said well what's your other name well my other name is esther well then starting now your name is esther and sure enough things got better names mean things you know so um we can choose we can choose to go with the world and all of its problems and all the chaos or we can choose to be here in church and look up we need a shaking we need to shake off the shackles of sin the shackles of attitude of non-concern and who cares that's not that's not the christian attitude you see we need a trimming a cut away cutting a way of lazy idle no interest attitudes and the idolatry it's everywhere idolatry so we're far beyond an aspirin or an alka-seltzer and you'll be okay no that's not the right solution you won't be okay you're going down we need major surgery amen we can't afford to continue to play church it's high time that we actively seek the presence of god in our individual lives get in the closet seek how to please god don't worry about brother david or me or anybody else just how can you please god and god will lead you through the word you see so his will is what we need in our lives now first john 4 20 if a man says i love god and hates his brother he's a liar and there's some sitting right here yeah for he that loves not his brother whom we can see how can he say he loves god whom he hasn't seen it's not possible see so however we treat each other believer to believer that's the way we treat god god's not some foreign thing no god's in your brother your sister and so he's watching our reaction to every test you think you've got problems so we're going to get into some problems here jonah had some serious problems because he didn't pay attention and so god could solve all your problems by the time the sun comes up you fill your bank account pay off your car all these things that we think are so important all that could be solved by the time the sun comes up no he lets it go on and on and on and he's watching for reactions you know because under under duress under under trial the reactions come to the surface you know and so um jonah was god's man of the hour okay and he had a clear-cut decision from god a commandment from god clear-cut go cry against their sin their corruption i know about the segregation i know all about your fears and your doubts go anyway okay so he's got it clear verse three but jonah anytime the verse starts with but we got a problem but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa down to the coast found a ship that's going to tarshish and so he paid the fare went down into it to go with them to tarshish from the presence of the lord it's not looking good jonah wasn't just anybody he was god's prophet he was god's mouthpiece it's looking kind of bad for him so he didn't break relationship he only broke fellowship sometimes we go our way well i think it'd be better god told you go this way you go this way i think it'd be better for some reason and you're still god's child and if you are he will jerk you back it's going to cost you a little bit but at least he cared if he doesn't if he doesn't touch it lets you go well too bad so brother branham says in another place something that you don't want to hear but it's part of it anointed prophets make wrong decisions they're humans because we're going to cut this idolatry thing see so here's jonah he gets up the next morning and uh god told him to go one way you studied it out in your maps and things it works out he goes down to the coast where the ships are now these are merchant ships okay they could be a hundred feet long they could carry 300 tons of grain and it's a merchant ship and he he reaches in his pocket he gets some tithe money and he pays the ticket and he's going to go far from the presence of the lord now forget it you know well these guys operating these boats they're they're watching the weather they're not just going to go off into bad weather so they wait till the right weather and they take off well they get out there a little ways here's a big storm how would this come from so they start throwing stuff off of the boat throwing some of the grain out and um they um they had this tourist at least one but you know we know they had at least one tourist and he he tried to act like the world he's tried to you know slide in there he didn't have his profit suit on didn't have his little tag you know elder so and so he's just he just was acting like one of them and he's down there asleep and this boat's going everywhere and so kind of like peter you know when he when he snuck in you know peter had one problem he he talked when he shouldn't have talked now that was before the holy ghost okay later he got straightened out but see um they're in the garden in gethsemane and boy he's going to defend and here comes the the authorities they're going to arrest jesus and he gets out the sword and slices off the guy's ear remember yeah so the ears laid on the ground now what are they going to do so jesus reaches down puts it back on they should all been on their knees nope they hate it so bad so they take jesus over to caiaphas house and somehow peter paid somebody and he gets in there he's in the yard now and he's uh he's acting like he's just one of the guys down the street he doesn't he doesn't act like a guy with the keys you know he he just tries to sneak in and when they when they serve the t and he said thank you that's a galilean accent just like you know when canadians come in here you know how they talk different well he was different and so oh you're one of them never heard of him yeah it was just a few hours it wasn't 50 years later and so here's jonah the same way try to sneak in and be one of the guys you know well in verse 17 the lord prepared a great fish for what to swallow up jonah so when he comes up on deck and he sees how that these guys are burning little candles and they're worshiping their gods and this thing gets worse he says boys i know what the problem is so he had a little bit of discernment and he said if you throw me overboard everything will be cool well we'll try anything well when they throw him overboard he barely got wet because the fish was right there fish been following this boat for a long time yeah and so when they throw him over he goes in okay well you see there's no surprises with god it was a special fish that had oxygen there was no lights but he did have oxygen and jonah could live there now he's in the fish and we're not going to argue about what kind of fish it was it was a special fish okay our god can do anything and so he's in the stomach of the fish now and it's dark so eyes don't work and it smelled really bad but you know got to breathe but he did keep his mouth shut yeah he learned real quick oh and so he punch well soft everywhere you know and he's probably up to his waist and you know what and um so he had lots of symptoms okay and the next time you think you got it bad and things aren't working out just right and the kids don't want to take out the trash and all these little problems that you go through think of jonah he had problems you see he had plenty of time to think about his actions over here in verse 3 going from the presence of the lord you know and so um so he's he's alive but probably wish he was dead and he doesn't know how long he's going to be in here you know they didn't tell you you've been here three days he's in there he doesn't know how long and so he closed his eyes you know these symptoms are all lying vanities now he was very much alive he could touch taste couldn't see he could hear he could smell and god supplied oxygen well now we got some unforeseen circumstances you know that five dollar ticket he bought to go on this tour i don't know i thought it was gonna be different because according to my calculations i'm sure pastor david has heard that many times well i think this and i think that you know the reason god allows hard-headed sheep to be in the church now we're not going to get no hands but every church has one or two the reason god allows these hard-headed sheep is for the perfection of the pastor he's human too you know yeah and so the symptoms you know are very real and he had to ignore his present reality and focus his mind on the word of god now guess what he did not have a cell phone okay he didn't have an ipad he had it stored up here now so many people are wondering why we're not speaking spanish because not enough people came to switch okay and we couldn't find a translator brave enough to stand up here so um and so he when he was home and he read his bible he had it stored and that's what you need to be doing because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow you might be in jail or someplace so while you have the opportunity read the word get familiar with the word because we are one with the word and so he had it stored and i didn't have any prophetic manuscripts no pictures nothing he got serious about praying and he didn't know it was only going to be three days now our prophet says to us the devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them in other words the one that was just converted last week when he goes to his knees the devil's tremble some of you people have been praying for years and god bless you but you got to get more serious in another place he says the weakest christian here tonight can defeat satan anywhere anyplace any time under any conditions with thus saith the lord you just got to believe it okay so why why is jonah in this situation well apparently from what we've read he shirked away he turned from his duty you know and he ran from responsibility he ran from the presence of god he ran from the will of god and chose his own will remember my will or god's will only the fellowship was broken not the relationship and so every one of us had to make a choice to be sitting here today you could be anywhere you could be over there at the fitness gym or wherever you haven't suffered but you chose to come here you see you made a choice you see and so jonah made a choice and was willing to pay a price to go his own way he just didn't have any idea how high the price was really going to be you see so he chose to go in the opposite direction god commanded him you can study it god said i want you to go northeast so we're in dallas now son i want you to go to cincinnati for example or louisville and he chose to go southwest i think i'll go to el paso instead it was just that opposite 180 degrees you see he probably thought well you know there's a lot of sinful people in tarshish i'll just go preach over there no more not so much hassle opposition and god would have blessed his word you see but obedience is far better than sacrifice and i'm sure you've got many testimonies to prove that but you see we have we have catholics here in town we've got baptist charismatics and so forth using this same bible okay only the mormons have an additional bible that gives them a way out but none of them are living the word you see and so there's miracles in some of those churches they believe they're approaching god now we're going to get to that in a minute here because god honors faith the prophet says in thirsting for life great message uh march of 60. and this great pillar of fire the angel of god now we've got the picture right over here we're going to got a better one at the house going to come up here soon that's the pillar of fire that's the same fire that led to children of israel so he says this great pillar of fire the angel of god the logos that went out of god that led the children of israel through the wilderness when it came amongst the people it separated itself and great licks of fire began to come upon each one as the pillar fire began to break up god dividing himself amongst his people that ought to tear the heart out of anybody god tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit on each one of us he goes on can you see why i'm standing for the unity of every church and some people stop there no you that's why he said say what the tapes say because sometimes when it's printed a little strange you got to know where the commas belong can you see why i'm standing for the unity of every church every full gospel church every believer that's where he's getting to see the unity of every believer we ought to be of one heart one mind one accord no matter how much we differ in the scriptures and it's going to happen if i bought the house over here on shirley way next to the pastor eventually we'd find something to argue about i guarantee you no matter how much we differ in the scriptures or you know your favorite quotation that might be one can see it this way that has nothing to do with it but in principle we ought to stand one great mighty army of god marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity now all these words are important wake up see you're looking at one person i'm looking at all the peculiarities yeah so he says here um because each one of you in your peculiarity god has proved that he's ignoring your doctor oh man i thought and doctrine was important well it's important but it's not the main thing god ignores your doctrine because he gave you the holy ghost and the bible said he gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him now if i obey him my peculiar way and you obey him in your peculiar way he gave us both the holy ghost so we ought to be christian brothers and sisters enough to arm up that's not single file single file is not god's way arm up you know make a sweep so arm up together and march on for one great purpose the gospel that your neighbors can see jesus christ alive in you because they don't care what william branham said okay they're looking for somebody who lives this bible but you see unto us he has revealed the mysteries of the kingdom we're more revelated you know and so god does not hold them accountable for the things that you know he has trusted us with his secrets the fullness of the revelation so god has a perfect will and he's got a permissive will for each one of us yeah no matter what your age is so let's see what the prophet says here in 1965 we try to work on god's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will work out together to glorify his perfect will so there is hope you see but there will be a price to pay another place he says we must submit ourselves to his will and to his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it and you'll smooth it and all just take it the way it is somebody wants to go around and make some other way and when you do you find yourself going on you find god blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not his perfect divine will so i go a lot of places sometimes we have questions and answers we might do that next time here yeah yeah see what's on your mind so people ask me how can i know god's perfect will for my life very good question okay wake up on the front row here we might hand out popsicles in a few minutes god's word god's spirit and god's will always run in parallel they never cross they run together in parallel okay okay so these three always agree the word the will and the spirit they work in harmony now some people have certain portions of the word memorized but their wires are crossed and they display a contrary spirit how can that be they're quoting the bible but with the contrary spirit well anybody can memorize scripture so uh when there's no harmony with the rest of the word then you have bad fruit results in contrary you know to the word now john 4 23 is where jesus met the woman at the well and brother branham talks about her just about on every tape if you've listened very far and he um he you know had a little debate there but he said look woman god is looking for those that worship him in spirit and in truth in other words balanced spirit and truth that's what we're after okay so they asked brother branham the same question how do you feel is the best way to find the lord's will in some important matters and we all have important matters whether it's the girlfriend whether it's the color of the car or whatever when you stand there look at all these clothes what's what i wear today you know some people only got one other change of clothes so you're very very blessed how do you feel is the best way to find the lord's will in some important matters 1961. i tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of god in some important matters is prayer oh we already knew that well there's more to it so we've got one got prayer um now here's the way i do it i take it before the lord and it's always been my strength i wait up oh wait well that's foreign word to 21st century i got a friend over in north carolina he's a real good coffee drinker and he'll go by starbucks if there's four cars he'll go across the street and buy mcdonald's he won't wait yeah it's just that way so we got prayer we've got weight okay got it i take it before the lord it's always been my strength i wait upon the lord and see what he says and then i just let myself be neutral oh it's hard to be neutral when you want something and you want it bad it's it's hard to pray and wait and neutral right let myself be neutral don't take either side so if i was in your place and didn't have these visions from the lord i would just wait upon the lord and say now lord you show me what is the decision to make and then the way you feel led to do it then wait a little longer then wait a little longer what's all this weight and see which way god leans towards now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter i want to know what you want to do about it so you wait you pray and you don't take a side and god will show you which is the right way so back here with our brother jonah god did make his permissive will turn around to accomplish his perfect will okay the special fish delivered jonah and the word of the lord reminded him once more now we're going to get into something sticky here and we hope that the you know idolatrous people don't get too upset when you listen to brother bram tell the same story more than once he tells the part about you know that the people of nineveh worship the god of the sea so the fish comes up there sticks his tongue out now comes the prophet and they all believed well i'd already read the bible at least twice now wait a minute he did tell us to check it out with the word and then i heard him say yeah i read that in a book okay so you read in the book sounds good but that's not what the bible says okay it says here in chapter where we at chapter 3 uh in chapter 2 verse 10 and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time saying arise go to nineveh and so forth so the fish is in the mediterranean i don't know if you you know in the globe you know it's got the mediterranean well that's where that's where the fish is and jonah's in the fish now for for the fish to get to nineveh he'd have to go out through gibraltar come all the way around africa and come up this river up there where nineveh is that's not possible that's why it says it vomited mount on dry land he's been in there for like you know almost three days and god speaks to him hey vomit him out so now you remember had his traveling with little kids sometimes they get sick you got a big mess i raised little kids so now here he is he's totally covered in fish vomit he lands on dry land so he's rolling in the sand never really got a mess the only solution for him is to go down to car wash right so he got a second chance after he got cleaned up got some new clothes chapter 3 records the greatest reaction to the preaching of the word of god greatest greatest revival in recorded history the entire city of 120 000 believed and stayed back the power of god the wrath of god they had a choice repent or go down with the unbeliever but guess what about 150 years later they entirely departed from the plan of god they forgot about the mercy they forgot about the forgiveness and the babylonians came down in 621 bc utterly destroyed the city now they didn't have bulldozers i don't know what they had but they didn't have the stuff we have today so devastating was the destruction that the ruins were only discovered a little over 100 years ago yeah 2500 years later such a hatred to destroy and we're seeing it in our cities in this country right now okay it's time for wake up i might throw it at you and so we're seeing that same thing just a hatred to destroy burned they have no reason no common sense scofield even says here such is the way of god light rejected brings destruction exactly true a long time ago in 1956 brother brahm said now this year is your decision for this country and i believe they're going to go the wrong way and sure enough you've lived long enough to see the results of those decisions back there okay god always warns first we're seeing today prophecy fulfilled everywhere hatred malice perversion so jonah was in fact a very crucial part of a much larger picture okay so much so that it's repeated in the new testament of our lord in matthew chapter 12. so here's the the lesson when you don't fully understand something maybe going on in this church or another family or or why is brother david going fishing or whatever something you don't understand that is going on be careful we don't need your judgment don't need your you know ideas it could be part of a larger picture and god allows these scenes to play out in order to bring the reactions to the surface be careful because god didn't call me or anybody else to straighten out all the things that i think are out of order just leave it alone you see it would seem that god's man god's prophet of the age god's anointed messenger it would seem that he was backslidden and he stepped out of the will of god it would seem that way because we as mortals with a little canary brain uh very small creatures that we are we don't have all the facts we don't know what what god's plan is we think we're going to build a church out here we don't know we're making plans god might take us all tonight we don't know you see and so we make these these knee-jerk reactions and judgments on partial information now i'm sure you've been in the mall or in the airports and you've seen people with a little thing in their ear and they're just going along just talking away who are you talking to you there's nobody here so we're only hearing half of the conversation right but if we stick with it we'll get enough that we can make up the other half and then we judge the case that's how we are we're mortals you know and so very few people of any given generation recognize the value of the message of god during their day hindsight we can see everything you know simeon lived near the temple he lived right next door he was old and he thought he was going to die but god said you're not going to die until you see the salvation of israel and he showed him what kind of sign to look for he was ridiculed you know and all that but he was spirit-led and he was one of the few that recognized what god was doing in present tense so whatever day they had their dedication to babies he would go out there and he'd look nope nothing today and go back to his hammock but one day he's out there looking and he saw the sign that god showed him to look for so all this line of mothers you know some with their dad and so forth so he goes up to mary he never saw her before but mary and joseph and simeon knew exactly what was going on and he said can i hold the baby well sure you know so he holds the baby and he prays the lord my eyes have seen what you showed me to look for now i can die in peace so he was one of the few that recognized fulfillment of scripture in their day brother braham says over here uh questions and answers on hebrews in 1957 this city of jeffersonville now we could put dallas or whatever city in there but this city at the day of judgment will answer a great price someday for there have been hundreds and hundreds of outstanding healings done right here that's right right here signs and wonders the appearing of the angel down at the river and the papers blasted and forth and still people don't believe why is it now someday i'm going to leave here now this is 57 didn't title 65. someday i'm going to leave here i'm 48 years old now why didn't the people recognize the picture that we have over here why didn't they catch that right quick why don't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies you know they can't do it but one day i'm going to leave this world and when i leave they will recognize it some of you young people will realize after i'm gone this day this scripture is being fulfilled harvest time 1964 what did the lutherans do after the death of martin luther they met satan and made a denomination out of it it died never amounted to anything else two tapes and i mentioned this before some of you probably didn't do it but there's two tapes in albuquerque new mexico and march of in april 64 of 63 i'm sorry albuquerque new mexico april 63. you might not believe but this is being taped listen to it a few years today if there is such and then you'll know whether it's true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking and it's too late then you'll say that man could have been right but it's too late then just exactly like jesus said when he was here on earth quote god sent you all prophets down through the age every time the system religious system had fallen apart and what did you do with each one god sent the prophet you all killed them put them in the grave exactly and then in about another generation you wake up and realize well that was a prophet and then what do you do oh you garnish the tomb try to make it right you know make it pretty exactly and you garnish the tomb and you make a tradition of his life that's where he finishes the quote and that's exactly what israel had done moses they made a tradition of his life see ever since way back before paul way back before jesus they read a part of their prophet's message every saturday like yesterday the the the uh what he called synagogue right here in dallas they got together they read a portion of their prophet's message yeah right out of the old testament been doing it ever since and so they made a tradition of his life that's the way we do with martin luther john wesley and other men huh i wonder who they could be we're always looking back making it for a tradition of their life garnishing the tomb and their message was for another day by the time you wake up that day has gone by and we're in another day the whole system has worked that way since the beginning man-made systems now there are negative promises in the word things that will come to pass it's not all blessing okay so my question today is brother branham's life going to somehow be the exception to this rule many people are just now realizing the value of this message we've had the warning so something you don't understand you don't have all the facts be careful we need to just zip it it's like jonah did you know psalm 46 10. be still i'm god so jonah was god's prophet but as human he looked for the easy way no pressure everybody to agree with him pat him on the back many times god will indicate his will to us individually based on your circumstances based on what he wants you to do and he'll show us his will and what do we do we discuss it with the relatives well grandma what do you think what do you think it doesn't matter god showed you what to do you see and um we're looking for a consensus and we take a vote and we reason we look for the easy way like jonah did brother brahm says you have to struggle to do the will of god sometimes it won't always be easy but it does produce the best results so today we have a lot of book carriers of course now we we got it all right here well i believe the message oh yeah and press the button william brown speaks everybody can do that you see but they're willfully by their own will climbing onto boats headed for tarshish the wrong way you see um a way that is not ordained in the word it looks like it see jonah went 180 degrees today we got people getting off two degrees well it's almost that way well they preach most of the message i don't care we've got to preach the message you see so god told jonah to go northeast he went southwest opposite these boats today are just a couple of degrees off and when it's too late we realize they're not going the right direction we get way down the road and well this isn't even the ship of zion you know so be careful so we can have a leading we can have a doctrine we can have a promise right out of the word you see but if it's um not in proper season flowing in the economy of god for the message of the hour you'll be fighting the will of god if you're just one degree off if you're not dead on like this right here if you're off this much going wrong direction it's got to be balanced so you can be just a little bit off and you know you'll be fleeing from the presence of the living god thinking and believing you're right but you'll be choosing your will and not god's written word not having rightly divided the word of truth and there will be a price to pay so we are living in dark laodicea and brother branham says oh here in revelation chapter 4 um everybody can't be a preacher but you have a voice every one of us is a living voice you know and if you are a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them that reject it just live your sermon so when your ladies go to town and they see the long dress and some of you got long hair and the people that speak against it well they're signing their ticket but when they bless you they're doing well so the preachers call to preach his and live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons and of course i gave you the i think uh last time i gave you the the quote from francis of assists all you catholic people remember francis of assists and he said preach always use words when necessary well brother i'm saying the same thing just live your message he says how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices in other words real believers that actually live it the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth without a blemish that's a real believer yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil doesn't care how loud you can holler he doesn't care how much how high you can jump and so forth what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything he's just as sweet as it can be it moves right on that throws him that's the thunder that shakes the devil we don't have to get in people's face brother branham said they don't care what brother graham said they're looking for people that live the word so if we turn our back on the word okay and we've seen it happen maybe not openly but just indifference maybe it's a little bad attitude like the john the baptist's father he didn't he didn't get up and scream he just showed a little bit of doubt see they've been praying for a baby for years and then the angel appears tells him all about it he just kind of shirks a little bit okay because of your sorry attitude you're not going to speak for nine months so if we turn our back not openly but just by indifference maybe a little bad attitude we're fleeing from the presence of god and following an antichrist spirit i hate to give you the bad news but that's exactly what it is you see and um and an antichrist doctrine and soon you'll be anointed with arrogance selfishness self-righteousness respect of persons none of that comes from god if we deviate one degree off a true center just a quarter inch then we got the ball rolling downhill you know if we degree if we deviate one degree we won't hit the target all you hunters know that you got to hit right straight on where the x is you know yeah so we assume you know that we're right we assume he is with us and like we spoke about mary and joseph you know um they went down to the temple every year for the feast and so forth now they're on the way home it's about 60 miles and they get to the end of the first day and mary looks around you know they're getting ready to set up their camp and have supper and she says joseph where's the boy well i don't know i thought it was your time to watch him they went off without him the promise of god how in the world they do that they assumed he was with him and so they ventured off into make-believe leaving behind the promise of god for the hour and many are doing the same today thinking that god is with him now the interesting thing about mary and joseph if you read the scriptures you'll find out that when she got back there the next day and they found him right where they left him he was you know talking to the priests and so forth she didn't go up there like a like you would a nice guy oh honey have you had any sleep have you had any water have it taken care of you while i was gone you know no she took oh jesus why did you do this to me you made me look bad yeah that's what it says so we got a lot to learn you know brother brahm says in 1964 it's possible today that good men fine men walking with christ reading his word and still don't recognize that this is the hour that certain things in this bible must be fulfilled and we've got the same thing going on today can you open this please it's a good thing you're here thank you we got the same thing going on today good man reading the bible marching along and not realizing that certain things have to be fulfilled he says it's the hour that we're living in the time is at hand that these things must be done it's written and thus it must be fulfilled because god promised it our eyes must be open to see the word now you can look at the word everybody's got a bible they can read it but is it revealed do you see what's between the lines the pharisees had it drawn out it's just exactly had big charts you know over here's you know garden of eden all this stuff had exactly how the messiah must come they believed they were right and here he was born there walks right amongst them and they condemned him they couldn't see it he said you guys need to search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me us search the scriptures are you kidding we're moses disciples we know exactly what brother brown said and when he said it and what day and and i had a friend once a good preacher he said and what has malachi 4 done for you what's made some people rich others very intelligent but has it changed your life has it brought you closer to jesus christ do you love the word or are you an idolater so i searched the scriptures he said if you would be moses disciples if you really were you would know me because moses wrote of me if they would have actually known moses writing they would have known him they thought they knew moses writing but they didn't know it they were blinded to that fact and it's a good thing because otherwise you wouldn't have never been here but god had all this big plan okay so um they were blind to that very fact so just a few very few words from him like that and what they did is spring up this man's got a devil he comes to teach us what school did he come from but they failed to look and see that the very god that promised in the word was vindicating right there in that person of jesus christ he was the light of the hour he was the light for the people to walk in and when god when god's big spotlight moves we've got to move with it we can't stay back here yeah i was comfortable back here we had all kinds of things going on but we got to move with the light only god's word produces light so what i'm trying to say tonight is look around discern your surroundings you see be sure that he's with you check up our life our doctrine and our experience have to match god's word not your favorite personality your favorite preacher and so forth your imagination no it's got to match god's word we can't afford to go any farther in the glare of another time live for today prepare for tomorrow because we're on a journey we have a goal remember this morning the resurrection we're headed there so we have a spirit amongst malachi 4 people because i know a lot of them a lot of places and um they're just religious tourists yeah they're passing through collecting you know souvenirs and yeah i was here and i went to and i went this i went there i mean i lived in tucson for a long time and we managed the the denrum out there some of you've been out there you've seen it okay there's brother rem's guns there's his animals there's the bear that never was a cub and all these things and people well they were so excited to see these things they were taking rocks out of our yard yeah little souvenirs well you can't have that so i went down and i bought some rocks nice polished stones and i had them in a in a bowl boulder you can all have one and so now you can take souvenir no charge so but but friends we're at the point where people are actually burning candles to this picture it's happening tonight in some of the countries some people have the attitude they just haven't got brave enough to you know burn the candle they got the attitude and so they don't have any relationship with jesus christ the author and finisher of eternal life we all have a choice my will or god's will god's word is his will okay stand at the door knock 1957 well that's the way it is today with people who call themselves christians oh i belong to church that's good but you see the reason there is so much trouble in the church huh you wondered why it says right here the reason there's so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church so much discontentment in the church it's not because jesus is not there it's because that jesus can't gain access to the places he wants to go we have these little compartments oh no don't touch that you can come in jesus no that's far enough i'll join the church otherwise don't tell me how to run my business jesus wants to be the supreme ruler of your life the only way that he can bless you is when he becomes your lord see lord is rulership ownership see and have no secrets before him open your heart another place christ outside the door and when jesus comes in he wants to be welcomed but we've got little secret doors little bitty doors in our heart we don't want jesus in there over on the right hand side of the human heart after jesus gets in it's a little door called pride yeah the big p pride i'll receive him as savior but don't tell me how i have to do things how i have to dress what i have to do let my hair grow out and stop smoking cigarettes and quit going to the pool room and all these other things that you know happen don't worry he won't stay too long very dangerous but you do have a choice so if he's not lord of all you musicians can kind of make your way up here because we're getting finished getting ready to quit here if jesus is not lord of all your life today and he's calling you and he's he's spoke to you today all you got is yield to him you see we can pray for you and and this can be the turning point in your life okay and he can change your will he can change your desires and put you on the right road let's stand together the word of god says in first corinthians 2 but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear has heard neither has entered in the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed to us by his spirit he sent a prophet took him beyond the curtain of time and he told us what it's like jesus be the lord of all [Music] jesus be the lord of all jesus be the lord of all o jesus be the lord of all the kingdoms of my heart oh jesus i surrender all jesus i [Music] surrender all o jesus i surrender all the kingdoms of my heart again o cheese i surrender all jesus i surrender [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's sing it again [Music] [Music] amen it's amazing the simplicity of god's word just to really examine yourself and to ask yourself he's in every corner of your life and everything that you reflect is reflecting him i know there's a great call in our lives that we want to see the lord jesus manifested you know and we want to see him in power and demonstration but he can't show his power and demonstration if there isn't a life there to witness it you know so maybe if we get the first end of it right first you know because the scripture says that these signs shall follow them that believe you know they're not the vindication that the believer the signs and wonders are is the following of the word and it's you know i like it when the word of god makes you think of all the little things that you're doing that are those little foxes that are just you know the things that are let go i always marveled at the definition of sin that brother branham used you know he said but said sins unbelief but he said sin is when you know to do right and don't do it that takes all the great big things out of the picture right murderer and you know and it brings it all the way down to just daily having that right spirit in your heart and it's hard to have that if you don't pray if you don't go back to those four things that brother george recommended those are his recommendations you know i i don't remember brother bam talking about reading the church age book but i love the church age book you know but that's an elder giving you some advice on it'd be good for you if you read the church age book but what read your bible right listen to the tapes read the church age book pray you know so there's so much we can do to sweeten our spirits and and uh take control of the things that if we just start taking control of the little things then i think the big picture would come to better for us amen you do that this week when you go out and testify and testify with your life testify with your heart be careful what comes off of your tongue and i appreciate it what brother george brought so much it stood out to me was about present tense you know being aware of the presence of the lord in the tents that you're in in other words that's right now when you're sitting at your desk right now when you're doing your job right now what's going on with me right now where's the spirit of the lord right now and the more accustomed can become to the presence of the lord the greater that we will see him others will see him get a point something someone to see yourself very good you know what i mean so we got to see him here and then we know that he's dining out for others to see so i think these are great words of of admonition today the simplicity of the gospel you know if if we do these things the greater things will come so we really appreciate the word brother george i i think it was well spoken and and uh you know i always liked brother george because he comes in such a different style than everybody else you know i always wondered what it'd be if he ran from this end of the pulpit and then ran around the church and huffed and puffed he wouldn't have said anything different than he said because it's not how you say it that's important it's what you say amen it's what you say so you don't read your bible do you just running up and down the stairs and no you get quiet and you just read the word and you let it settle in your heart and that's what's good so that's the things we want to do so let's let's this week you know i i thought this morning you know maybe this week as we go maybe as a church we'll just start in the new testament and every day somebody read i know you have your own bible readings but just read one chapter out of the new testament every day and if you know everybody in the church is doing that i don't know how long it will take us to get through the bible should be able to do it in about a year but the word of god will be rich in our hearts amen so if you love the lord today amen lord richly bless you but joseph gordon would you come dismiss us in prayer please my brother now brother joseph knows how important the word of god is because he programs artificial intelligence trying to teach machines to think i don't want to be a thinking machine do you i want to be a real christian with spirit life and i thought people that don't have the spirit are just artificial intelligence no real genuine christianity just artificial intelligence it's not a bad thing you do that joseph it's a good thing because you have a connection with the real god bless you we love you brother lord jesus so thankful to have been here lord sunday morning and sunday evening lord gather together to hear your word together as lord jesus not too long ago we were all not able together because the force of the landlord just said stay away you can't come together so lord has made these moments together even more precious lord it's made it more real to our hearts and give us even greater gladness lord to even be together and to be able to bind together lord and just even just stirred us up lord to to be more serious our father we're so thankful lord for the word that was spoken lord the admonition that was given what was spoke lord every single bit that was given lord the the encouragement and the push lord to be more dedicated to be more more on the mark toeing the mark to to put in that effort lord that we must do lord to be better christians so lord jesus i ask that you would strengthen me and all my brothers and sisters lord that we take the sword to heart and not let it slip and i will do our part lord in praying and reading and listening and believing i commit all the people lord and myself into your hands this evening and for the rest
