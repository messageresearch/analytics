and remember our pastor and remember sister leslie father those are still on the way we want to remember that you protect them and bring them back safe to us speak to us as we commit ourselves to you we are sitting in the middle of jesus christ amen amen god bless you amen let's open our bibles we're going to read couple more verses and then we'll continue where we left off this morning revelation chapter 5 we'll just read couple of verses um let's read verse 9. let's start from verse 8 revelation chapter 5 verse 8 it says and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them a harp harps in golden vial full of the order which which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred in tongue and people and nation it says and thou has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on earth amen we may have your seats man we just want to continue on with the same thought of the redeemer the song of the redeemed the song of redemption and just a reminder that we it's really the hard purpose is to bring us to remembrance of the things that we have received in this age to understand that we live in such a great hour and we don't want to be distracted we don't want to be pulled aside we don't want to lose focus but we we certainly want to be concentrated on the things that god is revealing this hour and the things that we know are promised to come to pass and you would ask the question you know i was when this uh just thought came to my heart uh the primary reason is to just kind of i realize uh some of the young believers that may not understand what is what is the message why do we believe what we believe and what do what is it about the seventh angels and the seven seals what does that even have to do with me just to come to the understanding that what god god has done in this hour had never done be done before and it was only reserved for this generation we're not like methodists we're not like baptists we're not like god done great things with them but then in the final hour we are those that god have called for this last final work that he's doing and so i thought it's important that we are not like the man that was living close by the sea by the ocean who came and you know he became so familiar to him he would look at it and and he saw someone visiting and excited about the ocean and he's looking at him he's like what are you so excited about we don't want to be those kind of believers we want to be those uh so excited with what god has done in this age and i'm not talking about excitement just to talk about it but leaving an expectation to show those things come to pass living in the expectation that one of these days i'm going to take the next step and i won't be here one of the steps one of this morning the meeting in the air is going to take place one of this morning it's not long anymore we have gone for so many years and we remember we live in borrow time so one or this morning this is going to come to pass and just be under the expectation to see god bring it to pass in our lives and so he david speaks in psalm 40 and 3 and he said he had put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god it says many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord so you see the same theme going over and over about what god is doing how that it's his work that gives you a song it's what he has done that actually brings you to come to a place where you can sing about it it's it's the work that he promised when he comes and he does it it becomes a song to your life isaiah 42 and 10 it says sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth he says ye go it says ye go down in the sea and all that that are there in the isles and the inhabitation thereof psalm 104 108 verse 2 and 3 says awake sultry and harp it says i myself will awake early i will praise thee o god oh lord among the people and i will sing praises unto unto thee among the nations so where we are and as we come back to this age like we said this morning we are commanded to sing a new song we are we've been giving a new song that we could live our lives by a new song that we can walk by a new song that we can prophesy by because remember when the lamb took the book when he came and we'll read those things shortly here in revelation chapter 10 when he came remember john in revelation chapter 5 when they began to sing they began to sing and he sang that song but when he came at the end in revelation chapter 10 and he gave the book to the angel the book was given so john can eat it it says when you eat it you shall prophesy so the book whatever we are prophesying is not coming from us it's coming from the eating of the book and therefore we have to you can't sing a new song if you haven't eat the book you're going to continue to sing the old song you're going to continue to think the old way but the new life come by the eating of the new book the prophecy come by the eating of the book it's all connected together and so in this generation if i may reiterate it again now i'll say a song is connected to worship and is connected to the worshiper but in this generation i said this morning we have been given the sum of all that god done all together plus more uh you you see because permanent speaks about how that this age the final age it says it's the totality of all the evil combined together that is coming brought towards the end and and that's what we see as the manifestation of it outside but he says it's the same what god has done he's come and he received reserve for the end time he's now giving the best of what he has god himself is coming down it's not even so much that is sending you and say in the first age we know that they had a messenger that came and the second messenger that came but then in the end time we'll get to it in a short time he sends one and and he says the messenger of the end the seventh angel messenger will have two jobs to do one of them will be to tie the loose ends in other words he will come and take all the other messengers in fact he would even place them throughout the church it will come the truth that we left out and things that were unexplained things that were not properly and now i'm speaking about his sage i'm speaking why we believe what we believe and i'm speaking about the power of it so he comes he lays out all the messengers lays out and he comes all the truths that were not properly explained the things that were left out he ties all the loose hands that was one part of his ministry but the next part was to reveal all the mysteries to reveal all the mysteries the plan of god what he wanted to do from the beginning what was hidden in god's back part of the mind the whole plane of redemption so you are sitting here with the whole word of god being revealed you are sitting here with a king's sword may i say god it's not just this send you some words and you know we'll get to it who says then he was praying in slovenia canyon and he says then something touched my hand and i look it was the the king's sword that came down he's not well perhaps it's just a king sore is there some king's sword that came into my hand and he said he feed it so perfectly if it it's open why because he was born to do that job he was born for that moment in other words this all that he had done until that time was only in preparation of what god was about to do at that particular moment so he comes and he holds it within his hand and says i thought perhaps it's a king's sword and he said no this is the king's sword this is the very word of god this is god's sword himself and and let me say this and i thought if it was the king's sword and it's placed because remember he says if all it takes is the sword what you need is a hand of faith to hold it and drive it in the heart of the enemy so he's giving you the best for you to go fight with he's giving you the best that he has so you can go and kill the enemy now remember after this there shall no more be any enemies this is the finality of what the devil is going to be because this bride is going to go out of here triumphant is going to destroy the enemy she's not going to go out of here with the enemy on the tail and everything after this we're going into the millennium so he says i thought it was so fading because remember he's starting off this isn't a message to preach he's starting off with that testimony about the king's sword and he said well i wonder what it meant that is the king's sword and i thought this is paragraph 13. he says if he would say a king sword i might have i might have been that it would have i would have understood it but he said the king's sword so may i not it says it says so i may not have have it right but i thought there's only one king there's no only one d king that's god and his sword is this it says sharper than two edges to it two edges so hereby if he abide in you and my words abiding you and then don only says then it takes the strength of a man dueling because his sword would be pointed to my heart and mind to his but they're locked as our knives are striking each other's and that they strike and then the sword came together and the only thing that can shove it out in the other any one down it says it's once it says down the sword straight down to the heart so it takes so it takes even though the sword would be the word it takes the hand of it takes a strong hand of faith to hold it so the king's sword now i want you to realize even as both whatever is saying is it's very important to understand that satan hates revelation because now this is the we we're dealing with the book of revelation because here he is god is now revealing and i'll say this god is exposing the devil and revealing who you truly are and brother enemy is saying this is the king's sword so in other words he's letting you know this is what's going to end the battle this is what's going to end all of it so if you take this word because remember when he says the king so i want to say this this message is the king's sword this revealed word of god is the king's soul i don't want you to think of some physical sword or something no this is what was put in his hands and so if you take the king's sword that was put in his hand you drive it to the enemy's heart you're going to end up victorious that's what he's telling you so he's saying satan hates revelation why because revelation exposes him and shows him what he's gonna end up being this message is open to us and it showed us the satan is just a bluff for the first time for the first time we understand that at calvary all the power had been taken out of him all his teeth had been knocked out of him and all that he's been doing is just going and barking like a roaring lion but no strength at all because the power of death was taken for him because remember that was the greatest power and then remember it was the greatest power because you can go back to israel remember the last flag was death and then so to the even to the mankind the last power that man could not overcome was death but when christ came and died what he did is he came to death not that he annihilated death but he took power out of death so even when a believer comes in contact with death death has no power against him so now he comes and he takes and he takes power over death and now in the revealing of the end time when he's coming and the purpose is because he had already paid the price that was only you say well he said christ said it was all finished yes it was finished but i need to remind you that the when it came the first time that was a sacrificial lamb that was given he came to pay the price for the sin that man committed he came to do that and that was the mission that he came to do and as far as the price is concerned that was done completed but remember redemption has to part he needed to come and claim that which he paid the price for and he didn't do it that time but when he says that only happens at the end time only at the end time you know i was thinking i said oh my no wonder all the prophets all the men that ever leave it all of them because i'll i'll say this but it says when that book was being opened it says elijah was there they all they all they were all waiting for this great event to take place after they had done the part that they played a part oh they were in such anticipation waiting to see what's going to come to pass amen so i want to say this and in revelation chapter five but when i'm and i'll just go uh read it and and and and perhaps just walk through it as we go along so we we said it only happens at the end time now we we we understand the order of it is revelation chapter 5 happens and then after that we jump over to revelation chapter 10. so he takes the book from revelation chapter 5 and then revelation chapter 10 that's when he comes down for the book with the book open for him to give to the angel so he says this and i saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne this is a revelation a written a book written within and on the backside and still with seven seals and prabhupada says this is the book of redemption this is the title deed this is the title deed or the right to eternal life that was given now and i want to say this we know that adam lost that when he sinned adam fulfilled his right but says he write to his right to eternal life and his right to the earth because it was god of the earth god created them to be the god of the earth and and tells us that satan could not touch that book with his dirty hands in other words when when adam lost it that book went right back to the original owner now but i want to say this but also remember the book god didn't make the book for himself no he was god over all things he was god of the earth and god of heaven and god of all things he didn't need a book he made the book it was the title deed that he made and it was he made it for man he made it solely for man so when man came and he lost the book he lost the power over all nature he lost his ability to control nature he lost his ability to rule over nature he lost his ability now where he was the god of the earth and we know barbara will tell us that god will come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with men and and find out what adam has been busy doing and he'll find out that perhaps he moved some trees and moved some mountains and did some things and they'll sit around and they will talk and they will fellowship about those things but when he lost when he when he when he sinned all of that was taken away from him he lost the fellowship now he never stopped being a son but he's lost his fellowship that's why when one backslide if it's a seed god cannot annihilate his own seed god god cannot create something and then lose it god is because what whatever he creates it's part of himself whatever he makes is part of himself whatever it does is extension of who he is so adam adam though he was uh separated from god but yet he was still a son and so we say as we said redemption has to process and and god was coming the first part that he came and he came and he paid the price but then the time for the redemption claim had to come and we find out that jesus paid the price but when him makes a statement he says it this way it says what what the law required what the law required grace provided what what the law required grace provided and i want to say this because remember when fellowship was lost we we go right back in the old testament we see that uh there was a way provided or god's provided way was then for offer sacrifice they came and they offered burnt offerings and they did all of those things and they came by which they would come and offer to god uh and then we realized that uh by the offering of the sacrifice i was not good enough because the sacrifice would be offered but the life of the sacrifice could not come up on the worshiper because it was a lesser life but that happened not happen until christ came and now when christ came it was the first time when actually the life of the sacrifice the life that was given could actually come upon a person it would actually come upon a person and make the worshiper perfect and then that was offered but that was not the final of it and let me say this when that happened uh we we got into another stage where when men sit what happened it came and we receive what is known as the token or we receive a portion a seal to unto the day of our redemption so you may ask well what happened to paul and what happened to all of them even what happened to all the believers throughout the ages when those that came after christ died what happened is god released upon his own spirit because remember he was a sacrifice when christ died he promised the holy spirit on the day of pentecost and all of those that believe on him receive of his spirit and they became sons and daughters of god they became sons and daughters they received the token they received the seal unto the day of redemption unto what unto the final day unto this day it it didn't mean that all was over now as far as their saving was there was safe there were suns there's nothing that could break the seal because remember the seal satisfies three things one of them is that the price has been paid the other is security but the other is ownership so when something has already been sealed it means that no one could touch it it means that it could never be lost and it means that it belonged to god and no one can touch it so that was what was happening until that time but that was not the end of it because there was also a promise for redemption where here they are with just the spirit moving upon them and and it says in that state they were still groaning and so we are this tonight you know he said they would walk up and perhaps sickness striking and then that perfect man inside began to groan for a well body you will go and you will see something happening it just didn't happen the way you want it or someone will pass away oh you would see and the spirit with him is groaning he would say even nature groan because nature wanted to see a son of god in control nature grown for the manifestation of true sons and daughters of god at the end time so even in this state yet we are with a seal within our heart with a seal with the permanent security knowing that we'll never be lost but yet we are we are longing for the full redemption to come into manifestation so he says and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to take the book and to lose the seal thereof and no man in heaven or in earth or in earth neither under the earth was to was able to open the book neither to look upon now i want you to realize it says no man was found worthy and for foreign uses it to say that this is why uh when when john looked he realized what was happening and he realized what was happening and john began to cry because he realized that if no one took that book that we will be lost in other words i want to say this john realized the importance of that book he realized the importance of the moment and the importance of the book and if we sit here and we are the type because remember john is considered the type of the bride then we need to understand the importance of the book then we need to understand the importance of that moment then we need to be under the same expectation because he wanted to see that book taken and he wanted to see it broken he says john knew that his name was on that book and i trust this morning that you know your name is on the book so no but random says that no angels could touch it and the reason was because they had to be a kinsmen redeemer they had to be one that was born in the family of the man one who was a man himself but who's never done anything wrong they had to be one who's able an angel couldn't take your place oh i like that no one can take your place no one he said he had to be born of the same family they had to be one who's akin to you and that's why christ came by the virgin birth and he came and he was conceived and he was born and he came and he took your place so you can take his now if god takes your place you become a sinner who do you become you become gods you become him let's not be afraid of those things my brother my sister i feel like every time we talk about it people gets timid and people start to look at it it's like what do you mean i'm god you are gods i'm speaking to gods i'm speaking oh my let me just jump forward now now remember when the book opens the reference that is coming to you right after that everything after that it's no longer the reference of you in your flesh or how you were born or how you came to the earth the reference was that he was with you in the beginning let's not be afraid of what god sent us to save us let's not walk be afraid of walking up in the morning and say i am god this is the domain that god has given me i'm gonna conquer it like a god i'm gonna treat it like a god i'm gonna treat my wife like a god i'm gonna treat my children like a god i'm gonna treat them like god treats me why because he's placed me here to conquer over my job i'm a god i'm this that's what you've been put here for why do you think the world is getting worse if so you can go out there and conquer it we're not gonna finish i know you love the word i i love the lord i love the word so much i tell you there's nothing that just burns my bounds like that because it's it's so much given to us to walk in it and and oftentimes when i when our lives get far away from it it's just so sad because this is our life this is life the work we do out there is not life going a job and do this that's not if that's all we live for we are the most miserable people that is on the face of the earth but when you take this you put it on top of that it makes all the sense in the world so he had to be one who was a kinsmen redeemer someone from the same family and god became a man so we may take his place and barbara says his grace provided what law was requiring the law was if the day you eat this you shall die so death was required but it says that was a law requirement grace came in provided and he said in one place it says god provided the bleach he provided the bleach something that can annihilate everything and leave no sign behind you're like oh there was just a mark here why poor oblate and see what happens god came in the but ranam says one place it says it it's like you you take whatever happens you take the stain it's probably a composition of molecule a and b and this and this he says god takes all of that composition he breaks it all apart he returns it into what it was in before he became only god can do this only he has to have the power to remember the difference was satan wanted to be like god but what he liked is he liked the power of creation that's why he came after you he wanted to be like god but it was just a one that could just twist it and twist things and modify it and deform it and deform it but yet god has the power not just to take what was deformed and bring it right but it was able to bring it out of nothing just bring it into existence it says and then i wipe because no man was found worthy to open oh the book to open and to open and to read the book it says neither to look upon aren't you glad the way the lamb is worthy aren't you glad the lamb is able to take the book aren't you glad the islam he came and he took the book and john knew the importance of the book as we said it he knew that if no one was able to take it the whole creation will be lost and so john is a type of the bride so so we have to understand the importance of that book and and and then so we realized that the that the message he talks to us in the message it says now when the when the he takes the book yes but one of them says that the end time message will meet the challenge of the hour the end time message will meet the challenge of the all and then he says the end time message will meet the end time condition and i want to ask you because remember when he did this he talks about how we have the devil's answer we have now they think about this we are challenging the devil for the word that has been revealed to us and telling him you have no place anymore in the body of christ you this pride has the same power of overcoming as christ did this bride can do the works that christ did this bride in fact is the manifestation of christ in the end time we have the answer to the devil's question i ask you what's the question what's the question you come up with the question the answer is here whatever you want come up with a question listen let me say this but random comes and he says when you talk about the the creation of the squirrel he says when he comes he says how do you want the scroll to jump he he said i give some ridiculous answer drop from here jump over there and do this over here this is a then appear over here and it happened i mean you're like it's not even how do you perceive this this is a son of god coming into full redemption the manifestation of it you talk about okay where are we going to this is what i'm talking about someone who's so fully surrendered in god's hand who's fully surrendered where his words god's obey where he speaks and the angel move where he doesn't have to scream he doesn't like brother said we sex people here we move him up and we scream we think if we do that god will hear us no just knowing that i've been given the authority to speak the word and it will come to pass we are moving into a maturity now remember when a church started he came they they obeyed the word and moved to where they are the spirit came and moved upon them and they did signs and wonders and yes we go throughout the church edges there were imperfection you know there were things they had to move from sanctification to justification to all those things and everything but even the baptism of the holy ghost they came into and all of that but that's not the end of it because remember the baptism of the holy ghost is only the beginning it's the sale but god wants to take you even higher into the adoptions of sons into those that will speak the world those that are representative of christ on earth those that knows that i have been placed here for me to perform at work not just to hold my job and to feed my family and go home it's in this revelation that we are promised the rapture condition will come my mind to my sister it's not another word it's not anything else it's this word this message the revealing of christ in the end time it says and one of the elders said unto me whip not or behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to lose the silo and i want to say this only the lamb could open the book only the lamb could open the seals no one else could and i'm here to announce to you this is not brother branham's message it's not the lamb the lamb came and used him so he can open the seals it's the lamb's message it's the one who overcame the victory belonged to the lamb it's always the lamb when you hear the lamb you have to know that the price was paid that he won victory when you hear the word lamb know that he was the sacrificial that was given and after the sacrifice was given victory was won and therefore you have the power and the authority and so we have to understand we could look at this and and know that it's it's important because and i was thinking about this and this is where people run into confusion because we talk about the opening of the seals and and the things thereof and people will wonder what it actually means because we understand all of those things are connected to the rapture and the coming of the lord now if you some of the things perhaps the way that was easier for me to understand or perhaps to assimilate some of these things you when when jesus came for the first time when john was presenting him we saw it was a very clear picture that was set before us we saw john in the water at jordan and we see jesus coming and john and and jesus came to john where branham says what is it the word always comes to the prophet now he he's saying that because they want you to understand what's going to happen next over here so the word always comes to the prophet so the prophet is here the word comes to the prophet and the prophet presents the word to the people this is the lamb of god this is the lamb of god that was given for sacrifice he see his ear to give his life so he baptized jesus and he presents him but in the end time here he is but branham says we'll read it there is a heavenly messenger who comes down with a book but there's only one earthly messenger so what he says is the heavenly messenger hands the book down to the earthly messenger who takes it and proclaims it so people wonder where where is christ or where is he i can't see him well in order for you to see him you have to see the same person the one who declared him to come he's the one who presents him you say how is that i said go read the third exodus because brahmanam says the same thing happened god said i am come down and i'm sending you moses so if god came down why didn't god go when when you ask a question when pharaoh see when he came before pharaoh who did pharaoh see he saw moses and god and the prophet answered that question he says god went into the form of a man god went into moses so he can speak and it's the same time in this third accident it's no different than any god came down but what form did he use he used the form of a messenger we live in wonderful times sometimes i feel like i could just run in the wilderness somewhere and just stay there forever just myself and just sing and shout and just have a jubilee this is the lord this is the word of god being manifested this is not some gimmick this is not men trying to insert some understanding or something this is what god is doing and i want to say this don't be offended by that why because the same way he used a messenger to dwell in him to do he wants to do the same for you [Music] by not believing that you're blocking it for yourself you're not understanding the plan in his totality the plan is not just for him to be in the messenger but for him to be in his voice he took the book and he broke the seal thereof no man was worthy and we are not worthy within ourselves because when we say ourselves our description of ourselves is the way we were brought up how we were born where we come from and everything but oh if we can change our description of ourselves into what he actually says into what he actually calls you to be into what he actually presents you to be it says and i be held and low in the midst of the throne look at where he is in the midst of the throne in the midst of the throne and and after four beasts and of in the midst of the elders stood the lamb as if as he has been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which were the seventh spirit of god sent forth in all the earth and we know we can go in some of those description probably don't have time but he he says that the lamb was coming from the intercessory he has been there in a seating for what for your ignorance ignorance of what you didn't know you were a son you didn't know you were with him in the beginning you just did those things because your flesh lets you do it you didn't know who you were you didn't have the whole revelation but once the revelation is given the ignorance is going away and it's not in the fearful manner where you say well if there's if he's not in sinning for ignorance no god doesn't lose attributes no god takes one and he rolls it into another all every whatever he was in the beginning is what he's going to be at the end he's never going to diminish in being god he's never going to become a small god or whatever now even when he took himself and he became a germ it was still god and he says and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and now he's coming for possession time now i like this but when him says there came he comes and he says behold the lamb of god but when when he comes we also read that he changes from a lamb to a lion but what is that now he says further down that a lamb when we say a lamb it doesn't mean an animal with carnaby says then he couldn't take the book he says it's only a representation it was his nature that was what it was he was meek he was a lamb he was there to give himself up but when he changes to a lion what is alliance signification the king now he's no longer playing he's not there to negotiate he's there to take what belongs to him he's there to possess what belonged to him and brother and sister this is not time to negotiate with the devil we don't live in the time where you go devil can you just give me this and say with this everything whatever what your children your family your loved one your all you have the rights you have the right to claim everything oh sickness or death you have been empowered by this lamb who's turned into a lion to possess all that belongs to you that's the time we live in he says in the song a new song it says and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and the four uh the phobiast and the four and twenty elders fell down and began to sing it fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vows full of others which were prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou have slain and has redeemed us back is redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred out of every tongue and out of every nation we have been given a new song i want to say this this is for what i'm saying the bible has become a new book the same bible it become a new book why because now the sales were open the understanding of what what we had ownership over the very because remember this is the same thing that happens with the children of israel when do we in bondage the devil's tactic is always to tell you a lie and once you believe a lie you stuck you're stuck you work and you labor under a lie you know it says you got this from your parents you got this from such and such you know you were born you you know you're never going to have full functionality you had surgery you had this and you did that you were stuck you only have to accept how many times i mean everywhere you know oh you know you you can't do this that's not what you were good at and all of those things and everything oh but how many even to the unbelievers how many of them have been told things that they believe in state and the condition on how many have been told they refuse to believe and they change their lives we don't have to believe anything from the devil in fact why do we even talk to him in the first place why do we even listen to him in the first place because remember he's trying to redeem his time he's trying to do all of this so he can stay a little longer because he knows in the end he's a defeated fall [Applause] so i want to say this this message is giving us the title did back to man this message is the only thing that restores all that relationship this message is what brings you right back into the condition that god wanted you to be in the minute this this message the final product of it is it produce what we call the manifestation of the third pool god working in man a son of god taking full power now let me jump around i know i'm running out of time like i said the goal is not to finish we'll we'll the lord willing we'll pick it up or we'll get back to it somehow i you know it's it's amazing because as a preacher you you know you see something and and the more you closely you look and the bigger gaps and so and the bigger it gets the scary you get because you're like am i ever going to pitch the whole bible again so you want god to just show you so you can stay at least in one lane and just bring it otherwise you just come here and you preach the whole bible again so it gets bigger and bigger and it's wonderful because god wants to fellowship with us in his word it wants you to know him he wants you to see oh our eyes have been opened we can never be the same a true son or daughter of god you you you can say oh i don't want to listen to tapes i don't want to do that you can you would open this bible you can never see it the same again amen absolutely no way because my understanding has been changed everything has been affected all of that i can never return to what i was all i need to do is keep going now here here he is now he's talking in he he moves us now in revelation chapter 10. now now when we when we open the book of revelation chapter 10 if you go to the the verse one so you realize the description that's been given in revelation chapter 10 the uh uh verse one it says and i saw another mighty angel come down in uh from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon uh was upon his head and his face was as though the sun and his and his feet as the pillow fire so this is the same description with the angel in revelation chapter one and verbum says that's christ so as he comes it's the same description but he says but but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he is declared to his servants to prophet so the finishing of the mystery but what i'm saying is starting at the sounding of this seventh century messenger now listen to what it says now in the breach paragraph 39 it says now but it's the book it's a mysterious book it's the book of redemption it says we'll get into that in a little while it says now we know that that is we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understand it's probed at through six ages but in the end when the seventh angel began to sound dismiss his mystery he says he he winds up all the loose hands of these fellow fellows probe that and the mysteries come down from heaven come down sorry come down from god as the word of god and revealed the entire revelation of god it says then then god it says then the godhead and everything else is settled it says all the mysteries serpent seed whatever more uh is to be revealed it says now see it's just it's it says i'm just not making this up it says that's what it's that says the lord i'll read it to you out of the book it says the sounding of the seventh angel messenger message it says the mystery of god should be finished that is declared to his holy prophet that's he says that's the prophet who was who has uh wrote the word and wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age the last church age all the loose hands that through these church ages have been probed that will be wandered up together and when and when the seals are broken the mysteries are revealed down come the angel it says down come the angel messenger so now remember he's giving you a description when he broke the seals he comes down and i want to remind you now as he says in revelation chapter 5 the book is still close but when it's coming down to revelation chapter 10 it's coming down with an open book now he says when he breaks it down the the god down come the messenger christ he says setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow upon his head now he says now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at this time of this coming now you you can't disassociate the two you you and and i want to say this because sometimes people associate the coming of the lord directly with well they're coming where's the rapture but you have to understand it's a season because in thessalonians it speaks about that the law themselves shall come first because if the law doesn't come there's no rapture if the revealing how do you know who you are and how do you identify how are you getting your heart changed how you get your heart turned back how do you get into the condition for the rapture the seals have to be open and there's only one who can open it and it's christ and it's when he comes down he reveals himself when you get to know who he is then he takes you up to the meeting in the air but that doesn't happen until christ comes down first we get twisted because people have uh projected it in a manner where it's so confusing people say the coming of the lord oh i want to see him then why are we still here no it's the understanding that this has to take first first before the other takes place but it's in the same spectrum of god performing what he promised he would do so when this heavenly messenger who's christ when he's coming down but what i'm saying right the earthly messenger has to be there because what is he gonna go say to the bride what is he gonna go preach to the people he has to get it from this heavenly messenger who's coming down for him to take it and go go give it to the bride it says and we we it says now see now we see that this seven seal book now is a mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from god now all the mystery all the mysteries that this book that this that this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger now he's the angel of the lord and another angel a mighty angel comes down see the angel was was an earthly messenger it was an earthly angel messenger but he comes but but here comes one from heaven a rainbow covenant so one is an earthly was it one is in heavenly now he says this in paragraph 47 he says and here he returns back in revelation chapter 10 after the coming time after the coming time and all the mysteries is finished is to be finished and the seals are to be broken and proclaiming that this is the time that that time shall be no more and he said when the seventh angel has begun to sound then the mystery should be finished and the time for the angels to appear we are close we say somewhere that's right now i know i'm going to run out of time i i perhaps just want to expand on this for a little bit and then we'll see where we can close now here he is it says when this angel comes it says when he it takes the book and he comes and he comes down and he says he says time shall be no more now he's here now declaring that because remember time was made for god to come and deal with sin and the devil he came and he created time for him to come and deal with that but he says time shall be no more in other words i'm not allowing this to continue on time shall be no more what time because remember the the very scripture tells us it says if had the lord not shorten the time then there will be no flesh saved but when it comes it says time shall be no more it's the understanding that he's now moving into whatever he wanted to fulfill for the he's now moving into the claiming work he's now moving into the place where he's now to claim that which he gave because remember he swore by no great about it that himself so in other words god is saying that i had paid the price i had given my life now i'm here to declare that it's time for me to take what belongs to me it's time for me to take man and return him to the position that i wanted him to be now he's not saying well when i say this then you shall do this you shall do this no he's swearing by no greater than himself he's saying by himself he's saying time shall be no more in other words he's now saying that this is the time for this to happen so we we can't have the word of god and sit in one and say well i wonder when is he going to do it no he's doing it now he did it he's doing it right now in our generation in our time he's here to bring you right back into what you were in the beginning that's why i said when i jumped forward i said it's important we realize that when he does this he comes and the references that he has for you is no longer you as a human he has a reference for you from what he was in the eternity everything he was i was with you in the beginning you were part of me he talks about the matter eagle who lost an egg he comes all the stories and all the references is about him taking you back taking you back taking you back bringing you back talking about amnesia talking about all of those things so you can come to a place where you could realize now he wants to bring me back so god is no longer needing to deal with us as creatures of time he wants to start referring to us as creatures of eternity he wants us to be reminded that we were with him in the beginning he wants us to know that what we are is not a sinful person who's born out of a parent and we just came into the world now remember this this is the first time that man is actually understanding where they come from how did they get here where they're going and their purpose here because remember if a man doesn't answer but what random says it says you have to answer that question you have to understand why am i here we we hear people people lose their mind they say it's because they don't understand they don't have a purpose in their lives they just woke up and they go they go up and down and all of that but it's when you have a purpose and you understand your purpose that's what gives your life a meaning and i'll say this this message gave our lives a meaning we were here just wondering and groveling in sin and darkness and all kinds of things happening and for the first time we even understand why we were sinners we understand why how come we fall to where we were we understand why we were in the condition that we were not just what we were we now have a purpose and understanding of where we're going if the musician could come i want to say this we have to take this word of god it's god purposing within himself to reveal himself to you it's god purposing within himself that we are going to be returning to the original state and this message is not like what pentecostal preaches it's not what makes it different is that we live in the restoration time and god himself has made himself real to you his medic and i want to say this let's not just take it as a text or as something that the prophet messenger said it's with every word of god you have to prove it to be true for yourself for what good is the word if we could just come and hear it on tapes and hear it in the church and hear it and rejoice and say i live in that time no if i live in that time i want the manifestation of it in my life i want to see i want a taste of it myself i want the reality of god that god to become my reality we're not called here to just believe oh the messenger says this we are called to have faith in the word but faith in the word is to produce what the word said it will produce we we are being given this remember john was asked to eat the book and i know you hear that many times oftentimes we are in the condition that we are in because we're not eating right we're not eating enough we're not feeding on it you that because remember the more you eat of something the more you become it the only way we get to become this is by eating of it by feasting on it drinking it that morning midday and night and every day and ask that god to take his word and come to pat and bring it to come to pass and i want to say this the spirit and the word are one perhaps we'll speak on this when you receive the word the spirit within the word will bring the world to come to pass oftentimes we have this mentality well i'll receive the word and i'll wait for the spirit to reign from heaven somewhere no what the the words of someone has his spirits attached to it the words of jesus christ is a spirit coming into manifestation once you receive his word you have received his spirit he never asked for any other manifestation or any other evidence except the believing of the word you believe the word he'll come to us why because it's god it's the word of god the same word that created heaven and earth the same word that says letter be the same word he says that word is never going and come back and return void every time it's spoken it brings forth that which it was spoken for and that's what we're dealing with here i said god let it produce what it was spoken for i will eat it i'll believe it i'll stay with it until the very manifestation of it i see you don't see it continue to eat you you'd struggle continue to eat this word will stick will take the struggle away why because it's the king's sword it's not a man's sword it's not a man's understanding this is the king's weapon this is to annihilate for once and for all this is to end the battle this is to say uh now it is done this is to say i have been returned into the original position and devil get there behind me you have no power over me now he comes remember he will come until the time he is because remember this flesh was born of sin and it was shaping iniquity and everything as long as we're still here we'll be tempted but god has come this generation to make you know to make you realize that you are here as god within the body of flesh doing the same works that he did when he was in the body of jesus let's all stand [Applause] he swore by no greater than himself that he will bring this to pass oh my if we could just reduce in what he says just to know that if he said it is going to come to pass there's no way and that's the song thou are worthy thou art worthy o god to do all of these things all we do every time we meet a challenge we just have to remember the lamb is worthy the lamb is worthy the lamb is worthy every time you meet a child just remember the lamb is worthy bring it before the lamb and you will take care of it let's just by our heads our gracious father we're so thankful for your word god we ask that you forgive us our shortcomings and your leaders and guide us our garden father let your reality continue to be manifested in us father that we may get to know you for who you really are father we pray father that as we move into this we call it maturity we call it adoption we call it the manifestations of sons lord every time we wake up that this may be on our minds and our heart that this may be the song of our day lord you you don't want us to work up and worry about our bills and and the challenge ahead and all of that you've already taken care of all of that you want us to think on these things and your prophet tells us that it's when we think on these things that's when you draw near and you come and you make it a past it was when mary when she had heard a word about how that a virgin shall conceive when she kept thinking about it and talking to joseph about it and when it was on her mind that's when the angel came and i pray father as simple as this sound lord we just need your word on our minds every day we need it lord when we wake up in the morning we need it when we meet a challenge we need it at every moment lord the more
