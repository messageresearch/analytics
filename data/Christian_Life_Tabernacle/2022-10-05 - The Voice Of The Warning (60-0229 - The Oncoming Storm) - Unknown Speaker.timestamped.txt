[18:15] but I'm certainly know the Lord will
[18:19] bless you I felt in my heart tonight to
[18:22] play
[18:23] 43 minutes about 48 minutes out of the
[18:26] message the oncoming storm
[18:30] um I I think it's appropriate with the
[18:35] great storms that we we just had
[18:38] they had a picture of a lady
[18:42] and she's standing in her kitchen
[18:45] and the waters up above her counter
[18:49] and she's sitting there with the water
[18:52] right up in her West waist probably
[18:55] about as high as this
[18:58] pulpit and water and she makes the
[19:02] comment she says next time
[19:05] I'll listen
[19:09] and I
[19:11] I just think that this tape is wonderful
[19:16] it's preached in 1960.
[19:19] but if I was to even express it to you
[19:25] this way I'd like to say
[19:28] the voice of the warning
[19:31] the voice of the warning
[19:35] and you know we find out that
[19:39] just like at Pearl Harbor
[19:42] all the signs were there
[19:45] but they they were they were partying
[19:49] you know what I mean and and they they
[19:53] failed to take the time
[19:57] to consider it we have the saying that
[20:00] we use they just blew it off
[20:03] and the same thing with the church uh
[20:07] the the church uh uh they just uh
[20:12] you know they they were just having a
[20:15] big Revival
[20:17] and everything was a Revival and you
[20:21] know that that's what the church was in
[20:23] a Revival Revival and they everything
[20:27] was fine and they were growing and their
[20:31] buildings were being built and they were
[20:33] full of people but what happens is is
[20:38] they forgot the voice of the warning
[20:41] they forgot what the warning told them
[20:45] was going to happen
[20:47] he said your morals are going to fall
[20:49] apart
[20:50] you're you're you're not going to hold
[20:53] the people
[20:54] you don't have the word they just failed
[20:58] to hear the voice of the warning and and
[21:03] and what happened all the conditions
[21:07] that the warning warned us of
[21:11] have all showed up
[21:15] all happened just the way that we were
[21:18] warned to and and uh and I'd like to
[21:23] make this statement because what's
[21:26] happened is is that that when once you
[21:29] fail to hear the voice of the warning
[21:32] then you failed to make the preparations
[21:36] and go to the place of safety and uh and
[21:40] and but it's going to happen just the
[21:43] way that it's spoken so I'd like to read
[21:46] this statement before we listen to the
[21:48] tape if you have your Bibles and you
[21:51] will turn to Matthew the seventh chapter
[21:56] and starting in the the 24th verse
[22:01] of the seventh chapter of Matthew and
[22:05] what we can do is uh
[22:10] uh when it comes time to read that uh
[22:15] portion of scripture we can just stand
[22:20] at that time and listen to that portion
[22:23] of scripture and then when the prophet
[22:26] of God's finished reading that we can
[22:29] sit down but I'd like to read this
[22:31] statement because I'd like you to catch
[22:33] it as we listen to it so how many
[22:37] understands there's an oncoming storm
[22:40] right
[22:42] there's a voice of the preparation
[22:45] okay it doesn't matter if you know the
[22:49] storms coming
[22:51] that's not what you're measured by
[22:53] you're measured by the preparation that
[22:55] you made
[22:57] and what does the voice listen to this
[23:00] statement that our Messengers making
[23:02] because he's making this to the church
[23:04] world
[23:05] he's starting to tell the church world
[23:08] it's coming
[23:11] make preparation and there's a voice
[23:15] of warning or the voice of preparation
[23:19] he says it pays to take warning
[23:23] the first thing to do
[23:26] before there can be a warning there has
[23:31] to be a preparation made for safety
[23:38] or there's no need to send a warning
[23:45] there has to be a preparation made for
[23:48] safety or there's no need to send a
[23:51] warning and the warning is only a voice
[23:56] of one having you prepare
[24:00] for the danger
[24:03] there has to be a preparation made first
[24:08] and then if the preparation is made then
[24:12] the warning can go forward to cause you
[24:17] to make your decision whether you want
[24:22] to listen to it or
[24:25] not
[24:27] let me tell you people are choosing not
[24:31] to listen
[24:35] they like the doctrines they like the
[24:38] teachings they like the Miracles
[24:41] but they failed to miss
[24:45] they failed to hear what he was warning
[24:49] if you don't want to listen to it well
[24:52] that's up to you
[24:54] if you do listen to it there is safety
[24:58] God has a method
[25:01] he works on God's method in that way God
[25:06] in the early days when the Andalusian
[25:10] world
[25:11] when people had gotten so wicked and so
[25:14] sinful that God could not look upon it
[25:18] and be just
[25:20] God is just
[25:23] and he has laws and when those laws are
[25:27] broken and the law that's broken has no
[25:31] penalty to it it isn't a law you cannot
[25:35] break the laws of God without having to
[25:38] pay for it somewhere you must do it the
[25:43] Bible said so be sure your sins will
[25:46] find you out he makes this final
[25:48] statement I think even when we have too
[25:51] much practice on sermons and not living
[25:55] enough sermon
[25:57] I would be a lot better if we lived our
[26:01] sermon each one of us would be a
[26:04] minister it's better to live me a sermon
[26:07] than preach me one the Bible said you
[26:11] are written Epistles of God read of all
[26:14] men
[26:15] see it's just best to live the sermon
[26:21] so I think it's best for us to live out
[26:23] the warning so as we listen to this 48
[26:26] minutes of this message
[26:28] put it in the context this is a
[26:31] messenger
[26:33] speaking out about an oncoming storm
[26:36] he's warning the church
[26:40] of the spiritual condition
[26:43] that they're heading to
[26:46] and there's a consequence
[26:48] for not hearing it work we're 50 years
[26:52] after
[26:54] the warning
[26:55] that went out in the message of the hour
[26:58] and are we ever seeing the fruits of it
[27:01] alive today I know you will enjoy this
[27:04] 48 minutes we just sit back we'll listen
[27:07] to it take it in for yourself
[27:11] examine yourself
[27:13] and ask yourself
[27:15] am I making preparation
[27:18] based on the voice of the warning
[27:22] am I making preparation because remember
[27:25] the voice is there to warn you of the
[27:30] place of safety we know our place of
[27:32] safety don't we it's the what the word
[27:36] amen God bless you I felt led to play
[27:39] this tonight I hope it's a blessing to
[27:40] you
[27:43] let us turn now in our Bibles quickly
[27:45] through the seventh chapter of Saint
[27:48] Matthew
[27:50] and we let's begin reading at the 24th
[27:52] first
[27:54] therefore whosoever every year these
[27:57] things of mine and doeth them I will
[28:00] liken him into a wise man which built
[28:02] his house upon a rock
[28:04] and the rains descended and the floods
[28:07] came and the winds blew and beat up on
[28:11] the house and it fell not for it was
[28:14] founded up on a rock
[28:18] and everyone they Hearth these sayings
[28:21] of mine and doeth them not
[28:24] shall be likened into a foolish man
[28:26] which built his house upon the Sands and
[28:29] the rains descended and the floods came
[28:32] and the winds blew and beat up on the
[28:34] house
[28:35] and fell and great was the fall of it
[28:40] may the Lord had his Blessings Now to
[28:42] the reading of his words
[28:46] I wish to speak for a few moments upon
[28:49] the subject
[28:50] of the oncoming storm
[28:57] and I've trusted God that we will be
[29:01] able to yield ourselves to the Holy
[29:04] Spirit
[29:07] for anyone knows that I'm not a preacher
[29:11] that's there's preachers behind me here
[29:16] I never got the education to be a
[29:18] minister
[29:20] but and my old slow ways
[29:25] but I the lord gave me something else to
[29:29] do but I love to take a time so I can
[29:33] explain what I know about the Lord and
[29:37] and about his goodness and trying to
[29:39] tell others about it
[29:43] and now we are speaking tonight on the
[29:46] coming storm and if I fail in words to
[29:49] express what I feel in my heart I pray
[29:52] the Holy Spirit Will Reveal it
[29:57] foreign
[29:59] Jesus was speaking here of a coming
[30:02] storm which has got to strike every man
[30:06] and every woman is born in the world
[30:09] there's just no way out of it
[30:13] that star will strike you sometime our
[30:16] other
[30:18] and it depends on what kind of a
[30:20] foundation that you have whether your
[30:23] house will weather it or not
[30:27] there's been many lives saved
[30:31] because of preparation for storms
[30:35] and there's been a many a life's loss
[30:39] because of failing to take heed to the
[30:42] warning of storms that's coming
[30:50] not long ago
[30:52] I was told of a story that happened I
[30:55] believe I read it in a newspaper
[30:58] down in Florida
[31:02] they have many great storms that sweeps
[31:05] through Florida
[31:06] typhoons that come in off the sea and
[31:09] brings the water for city blocks up into
[31:12] the City and sweeps out everything
[31:17] and I'm told that their weather prophets
[31:20] are always on the lookout for such
[31:23] storms and some way through the the
[31:27] elements that they can contact the
[31:30] changing of the weather and the
[31:32] atmosphere
[31:34] that which away this weather is
[31:37] gathering that'll bring forth one of
[31:40] those storms
[31:42] because they've made it a life study
[31:45] and by certain instruments and things
[31:48] that science has provided them
[31:52] and then by calling ahead and hearing of
[31:55] which away the storm's coming how much
[31:57] wind it's got behind him which way other
[32:00] storms are coming of winds whether it's
[32:02] able to combat to shove away the storm
[32:07] I could stop here and preach for hour on
[32:11] that
[32:12] that it takes a greater storm
[32:16] that's coming it takes a higher wind to
[32:20] turn that storm
[32:23] so is it today
[32:26] and we all know that we've got an
[32:28] oncoming storm
[32:31] I'm the only wind I know that can turn
[32:35] that storm will be that Russian wind
[32:37] that fell on the day of Pentecost
[32:42] I'm told that there's men even in the
[32:44] city now speaking against communism
[32:49] and they should be
[32:51] but just speaking against it isn't
[32:54] enough
[32:55] we've got to find how to turn the thing
[33:01] and then there is only one thing that
[33:05] can turn that storm
[33:07] and that's a more powerful
[33:10] storm
[33:12] that can be said it and change its
[33:15] course
[33:18] and these prophets saw the weather in
[33:21] Florida are pretty accurate with their
[33:23] prophesying
[33:26] they are set forth that purpose
[33:30] to warn the people
[33:34] I was reading or forget just now I
[33:37] believe it was in a newspaper
[33:39] of a storm a few years ago that was on
[33:43] its way across Florida Central Florida
[33:47] and all the regions around Okeechobee
[33:51] was
[33:52] was worn I just left there about five
[33:55] weeks ago
[33:58] and there was a neighbor man who kept in
[34:01] contact with radio all the time because
[34:04] of these storms and
[34:06] he was a very renowned Christian
[34:10] and he heard that the great Thai food
[34:14] was coming that way twisting down trees
[34:18] and everyone was born to get to safety
[34:23] and he thought of his neighbor
[34:26] who had a chicken farm
[34:28] and some light buildings with their
[34:30] chickens in them their brooder houses
[34:33] and so forth and their pins were all
[34:36] that they had in life was tied up with
[34:39] these chickens
[34:41] other living
[34:43] and he rushed quickly frantically up to
[34:46] the gate and stopped his car and jumped
[34:49] out and said to this fella take all the
[34:52] chickens and put them in your storm
[34:55] shelter and you rush over to mine
[34:58] because there is coming a typhoon or a
[35:02] storm that's going to twist everything
[35:04] down
[35:06] and the man stood and looked him in the
[35:09] face and laughed at him
[35:12] and said nonsense
[35:16] I've heard them predict such things
[35:18] before and it never did happen
[35:22] and the Christian neighbor was so
[35:24] excited he said but what if it does
[35:28] happen
[35:29] we hear remarks like that along the line
[35:32] I've heard of this is going to happen
[35:34] that's going to happen but it is going
[35:36] to happen one of these days
[35:40] and it behooves us to listen to every
[35:42] warning
[35:45] but this man said I have no time for
[35:48] such
[35:49] foolishness
[35:51] I raise chickens and I have no time for
[35:54] such any cried out the neighbor said in
[35:58] the name of God he said leave those
[36:01] chickens alone to him John and come
[36:03] quickly you and your family if you don't
[36:07] want to believe it
[36:09] let your family come
[36:12] and he said I will not have my children
[36:15] to be excited over a few radio warnings
[36:20] my children I have decided will live as
[36:23] I live
[36:25] and my wife will listen to me because I
[36:28] am the breadwinner of this home
[36:32] and she must listen to me I'm Bossier
[36:37] and I will not have my children all
[36:39] excited or tore up about some nonsense
[36:43] and the neighbor was turned and he went
[36:45] to his home into his shelter and all of
[36:50] a sudden
[36:52] the cloud was up on him before they knew
[36:55] it
[36:56] that's the way judgment strikes
[37:00] it comes so sudden
[37:04] you'll wonder how I can get there so
[37:06] quick
[37:07] I have seen cruel man who once cursed
[37:11] God
[37:12] fall and scream and say how could you
[37:15] treat me this way
[37:17] a whole every Foundation must swept out
[37:19] from under him in a moment
[37:23] it pays to take warning
[37:28] oh you might laugh at the messenger
[37:32] you might be able even to kill him
[37:35] but you cannot kill the message
[37:39] go on just the same
[37:42] God's message is eternal
[37:45] his words will never fail
[37:50] Paul was successfully in heaven Stephen
[37:53] stoned
[37:55] but all to his life until he surrendered
[37:59] to Christ was he never able to get away
[38:01] from that message I see Heavens open and
[38:05] Jesus standing on the right hand of God
[38:09] something got a hold of him
[38:11] it wasn't the messenger it was a message
[38:13] he had
[38:16] while the storms swept through the
[38:20] country it caught the chicken house and
[38:22] the farmer
[38:23] and they never found his body
[38:28] and his wife frantically fighting and so
[38:32] they live close to the great Okeechobee
[38:34] Lake
[38:35] and the waters begin to rise as the
[38:38] typhoon lifted the waters all the way
[38:40] from the bottom of the lake
[38:43] that's what makes them so dangerous
[38:45] they're shallow
[38:47] the boats Rock and that's how the waves
[38:50] come up and turn the boats beneath them
[38:54] the storms comes and just whirls up the
[38:57] water and packs it for miles
[39:00] and the water sweeping until the mother
[39:04] no there was no hope
[39:06] but to get her children home top of the
[39:08] building
[39:11] and she got her children and got them on
[39:14] top of the building holding on to the
[39:16] chimney of the house
[39:18] and then the wildlife the cottonmouth
[39:20] moccasin
[39:22] I believe a more deadly snake in your
[39:25] Diamondback rattler
[39:27] they was calling for safety
[39:30] and they come on the roof with her
[39:34] I'm about to listen to her husband not
[39:37] taking heed to the warning she had to
[39:40] she stomped and she beat but she had to
[39:44] stand and watch those vicious snakes
[39:47] bite her children until they died on the
[39:49] roof
[39:52] and the mother herself Was Bitten so
[39:54] much until finally she died that's the
[39:57] only way we got the story at the storm
[40:00] had quietened and the search parties
[40:02] hunting for bodies and so forth they
[40:04] found her laying on top of the roof with
[40:06] her children laying by her side
[40:09] oh it pays to take warning
[40:16] the first thing to do before there can
[40:19] be a warning there has to be a
[40:21] preparation made for safety
[40:24] or there's no need of sending a warning
[40:27] and the warning is only a voice
[40:31] of one
[40:32] having you to prepare for the danger
[40:38] there has to be a preparation made first
[40:42] and then if the preparation is made
[40:45] then the warning can go forward to cause
[40:49] you to make your decision
[40:51] whether you want to listen to it or not
[40:54] if you don't want to listen to it
[40:57] well that's up to you
[40:59] if you do listen to it there's safety
[41:03] God
[41:04] has the same method
[41:08] we work on God's method in that way
[41:12] God in the early days
[41:15] when the antelopean world when people
[41:18] had gotten so wicked and so sinful
[41:22] that God could not look upon it and be
[41:25] just
[41:28] God is just
[41:32] and he has laws when those laws are
[41:36] broken and in law that's broken has no
[41:38] penalty to it isn't law
[41:42] you cannot break the laws of God
[41:46] without having to pay part somewhere
[41:50] you must do it the Bible said be sure
[41:54] your sins will find you out
[41:58] what is sin
[42:02] I'd like to stop here just a moment many
[42:05] people think smoking cigarettes is a sin
[42:08] it isn't
[42:09] many people think that lying is the sin
[42:12] it isn't
[42:13] committing adultery that isn't sin
[42:16] that's the attributes of unbelief
[42:19] you the reason you do those things is
[42:22] because you are an unbeliever
[42:27] there's only two things that's you are
[42:30] either a Believer or an unbeliever
[42:34] if you are a Believer you do not those
[42:36] things
[42:38] if you do do them I don't know what kind
[42:41] of profession you have but if you do
[42:43] that the love of God isn't in you the
[42:46] Bible said so
[42:48] we've got too much profession without a
[42:51] possession of it
[42:52] too many saying and not living it
[42:56] I think even we have too much practice
[42:58] on sermons and not living enough sermons
[43:01] it'll be a lot better if we lived our
[43:03] sermon each one of us would be a
[43:05] minister
[43:07] it's better to leave me a sermon than
[43:09] preach me one the Bible said that your
[43:12] written Epistles of God read of all man
[43:16] so it's best to live the sermon
[43:20] sin is because you believe not
[43:24] did not Jesus say in the days of his
[43:27] flesh on Earth
[43:29] did he not call the people that would
[43:33] not lie that would not steal
[43:37] that would not commit adultery
[43:41] righteous man
[43:44] preachers priests
[43:47] he said you are of your father the devil
[43:52] because they believe not on the son of
[43:54] God
[43:55] he that believeth not is condemned
[43:58] already
[44:00] some time ago I made it making Alder
[44:03] calls I love John 5 24. he that Hearth
[44:08] my words and believeth on him that sent
[44:09] me as eternal life
[44:11] and shall not come into judgment but
[44:13] it's passing death in the light
[44:15] he that believer
[44:18] he said that's pretty light no that's
[44:20] pretty deep
[44:22] for when you believe no man can call
[44:26] Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit
[44:31] when you have the Holy Spirit then you
[44:33] have believed on eternal life and have
[44:35] eternal life
[44:37] either Hearth my words and believeth on
[44:39] him it sent me has eternal life
[44:43] and shall not come into the Judgment
[44:44] that's passed from Death unto life
[44:47] preparation making ready
[44:51] and God seemed the wickedness of the
[44:54] world
[44:56] I am seeing that Wicked and adulterous
[44:59] generation and his holiness
[45:03] could not stand it anymore
[45:07] oh to this sinful world
[45:11] I stopped the other day
[45:13] on my road to the grocery with my wife
[45:18] and we were talking about
[45:21] a certain young lady of our city
[45:25] real cold weather
[45:27] and with the little chubby coat on and
[45:30] dressed in Marley with those little
[45:32] sharks on it they wear in the summertime
[45:35] and it will skip the snow on the ground
[45:39] and my wife said you know that woman
[45:42] can't be comfortable
[45:46] and I said no
[45:49] she's just not in her right mind
[45:55] and she said
[45:56] well
[45:58] you know she goes to high school now I
[46:01] said
[46:02] she might go to high school but that
[46:04] still doesn't
[46:06] make everything right
[46:09] I said she cannot be mentally right
[46:13] when we go into Germany
[46:16] I was in Germany sometime ago in a great
[46:19] meeting where the Lord was giving us
[46:21] around around ten thousand Souls a night
[46:24] and I was so amazed one night when I
[46:27] come from the meeting at a I'm down the
[46:30] street to a place where I was invited
[46:32] for a little luncheon
[46:35] and it was closing all the needy and all
[46:38] the Christians sitting around drinking
[46:40] beer
[46:42] well America
[46:45] Canada
[46:47] and
[46:49] England is the only Nations I know that
[46:52] refuses the Christians to drink
[46:55] they don't get drunk
[46:58] but we Americans
[47:02] then when I didn't drink it
[47:06] so after all there come a question
[47:07] around the table what was the matter
[47:09] that I wasn't drinking my beer was it
[47:11] because it wasn't good
[47:14] and Dr gookenview sitting next to me
[47:17] which provided me an interpreter
[47:19] I said what they all mermaid about to me
[47:22] and he sat there wondering why you don't
[47:24] drink
[47:26] now I know it's written when you're in
[47:29] Rome be a Roman
[47:30] but I said tell them this
[47:34] I do not condemn them
[47:37] but I was born under a Nazarite birth
[47:40] I'm not supposed to drink I didn't want
[47:43] to hurt them
[47:44] I'm
[47:46] they understood it went right on
[47:47] drinking
[47:50] and then in Italy we found almost the
[47:52] same thing
[47:54] and many different parts of the world
[47:56] when you go into the Nations you find
[47:58] the spirit of the nation
[48:03] I remember the Holy Spirit give me a
[48:05] warning not to go to the YMCA in Finland
[48:09] I didn't know why it was about come to
[48:11] find out they had bath women there
[48:15] when I stayed away and I would not go in
[48:18] with Dr munion and then as far as swim
[48:20] and I found out those scrub women
[48:23] scrubbed the man
[48:25] and I said that's not right
[48:28] well he said brother Brennan that's just
[48:30] as much right as your nurses isn't in
[48:31] the United States
[48:33] said they're trained for that I said I
[48:35] don't care how much you're trained it
[48:36] never was intended that way but I'm
[48:39] covering them up and made them different
[48:41] right
[48:43] but they pay no attention to it they
[48:46] were thins wonderful people
[48:49] but it's a spear of the nation
[48:51] wherever you go you find the spirit of a
[48:53] Nation
[48:54] you come to America you've really had it
[48:57] then
[48:58] that's the worst of all
[49:01] and my wife said to me while those
[49:04] people go to church
[49:07] and I've often wondered why it didn't
[49:09] condemn their conscience
[49:10] I said my dear wife let me tell you they
[49:14] are Americans she said well Walmart we
[49:17] ought to know
[49:18] I said we just live here
[49:21] but we've been born from above the holy
[49:25] spirit of God come upon us
[49:28] therefore we are pilgrims and strangers
[49:31] here
[49:32] this is not our Abiding Place but we are
[49:36] seeking a city to come whose Builder and
[49:38] maker is God
[49:39] therefore when you're born of above you
[49:42] have a holy spirit coming down from God
[49:45] that changes your nature no matter your
[49:48] sister your mother your your best friend
[49:52] could be it dressed that way but the
[49:54] Christian
[49:56] that's barned of the spirit of God
[49:59] is born from above and their spirit is
[50:02] of another kingdom
[50:04] oh I'm so glad at that
[50:09] the simpleness of the Holy Spirit to
[50:11] follow it and watch it how it behaves
[50:14] makes you behave
[50:17] that's the way it was in the days of
[50:19] Noah and God got so filled up in it
[50:23] but before he sent a storm
[50:28] to destroy the entire world
[50:32] God made preparation for those who
[50:34] wanted to stay out of it
[50:37] and I can see Noah
[50:39] standing in the door of the Ark
[50:42] preaching righteousness
[50:45] oh there wasn't many would listen at him
[50:48] there was something like today they want
[50:50] entertainment not the gospel
[50:54] woe unto these Hollywood evangelists
[50:59] who's afraid to call Sin Sin
[51:04] we need some of the old-fashioned
[51:07] Backwoods preachers that's got the Holy
[51:11] Spirit that's not afraid to preach the
[51:15] gospel with their bare hands not covered
[51:18] up with some kind of a rubber glove but
[51:21] preach the coming of the Lord Jesus
[51:23] judgment for the wicked
[51:26] heaven for the righteous and the near
[51:29] approaching what season I don't know and
[51:32] no one else knows
[51:34] but I'll warn my generation
[51:37] if it comes now I want them to be warned
[51:41] I can see no way in that door of the
[51:44] very heart
[51:46] oh I just like to believe one thing it
[51:48] wasn't that way
[51:50] but Noah standing in that door
[51:53] the only way to safety
[51:56] I can see Moses later standing in the
[52:00] door with blood on the little
[52:02] preaching judgment
[52:05] with the blood on the limb
[52:08] today Jesus
[52:11] is the door to the Sheepfold
[52:16] Ministers of the Gospel standing in that
[52:19] door pleading with the congregation
[52:24] to come to safety
[52:27] no doubt but what there was many laughed
[52:30] at Noah made fun of and the Bible said
[52:33] they were scoffers
[52:35] I can just hear them say something like
[52:37] this
[52:38] Noah if you haven't got some better
[52:42] entertainment than that we'll just stay
[52:44] home
[52:45] the world today America doesn't want the
[52:49] gospel
[52:50] they want entertainment
[52:52] they've got to have something to
[52:54] entertain them a lot of fancy music or
[52:58] something like that or some kind of a
[53:01] party some kind of a wiener roast but
[53:04] stem things are all right outside the
[53:06] church
[53:07] but the churches or judgmental to be
[53:10] preached in the power of the
[53:12] resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[53:15] and a warning
[53:17] judgment begins at the house of God not
[53:21] parties
[53:22] judgment
[53:26] lot was born
[53:29] I am when the Angels told that he didn't
[53:31] know they were angels
[53:33] when they went down their message was to
[53:36] Sodom come out of this sinful place
[53:41] God has provided a way of Escape for you
[53:45] come out of the sinful Place Jesus said
[53:48] as it was in the days of Sodom
[53:51] look what kind of a life they were
[53:53] living
[53:55] and Jesus compared that day with this
[53:57] day
[53:58] sinful watch when lot went to tell his
[54:01] people they laughed at him made fun of
[54:05] him
[54:07] and the sins of the city vexed his
[54:09] righteous soul
[54:11] the Angel's message didn't stare them
[54:14] had no effect on him but they were asked
[54:16] to come out because judgment was upon
[54:19] the city
[54:20] and God was going to bring a storm of
[54:22] fire upon the city
[54:26] and they refused to walk they refused to
[54:29] come out they were satisfied with their
[54:32] sins
[54:33] people today seem to be so comfortable
[54:36] in sin
[54:37] because we own a new car because we
[54:40] could eat three meals a day
[54:42] sleep on a clean bed that's wonderful
[54:45] but that would be good but we forget
[54:48] Godwin Prosperity comes like that
[54:51] I think we've been so we preachers and
[54:54] we Christians has been so interested in
[54:56] and the program of filling our churches
[54:59] and getting a better church or something
[55:01] like that or a bigger Church better pews
[55:03] or you know harm what I mean and we've
[55:05] left off the main thing
[55:07] judgment righteousness power of the Holy
[55:10] Ghost
[55:11] Resurrection
[55:13] Eternal judgment
[55:16] the angel never failed to preach the
[55:18] message although they tried to stop him
[55:21] but their message went on just the same
[55:25] now did you notice it's just like a man
[55:28] that says I'm going to refuse to believe
[55:31] the sons are Shining
[55:33] I will have nothing else to do with the
[55:36] sun closes his eyes and goes down in his
[55:39] basement of his house and said I just
[55:41] refused and all the sons are Shining
[55:45] well you say brother Branham that man
[55:47] would be something mentally wrong with
[55:49] him well a man that would reject Jesus
[55:52] Christ has the same grounds
[55:55] the holy spirit is more real than the
[55:58] sunshine
[56:01] son will fail
[56:03] but the Holy Spirit can't fail
[56:08] it don't only light for the sense of
[56:12] sight but it lights for the soul of a
[56:15] light of Glory that leads us to God
[56:18] that rejects our projects rather Calvary
[56:22] to us and the sufferings of the Lord
[56:24] Jesus the oncoming judgment and the
[56:27] Escape for those who want to come
[56:30] I'd rather be totally blind physical and
[56:33] have my spiritual sight
[56:36] then to be totally blind spiritual and
[56:39] have my physical side I want to have
[56:42] spiritual sight
[56:45] notice
[56:47] what would be wrong with that man
[56:50] those his friends would come and say Jim
[56:53] John or whatever his name might be
[56:56] you are wrong come out of that old dingy
[57:00] basement musty
[57:02] he would stand and say I'll tell you I'm
[57:06] satisfied where I am
[57:09] he doesn't want the the welcome Sunshine
[57:12] he doesn't want his healing rays he
[57:15] doesn't want his Beauty it's it's warm
[57:18] for his life
[57:21] something could be wrong with the man
[57:23] and so is a man or a woman who wants to
[57:27] stay in the dingy world
[57:29] shut up in the musty sin of unbelief
[57:33] and say in the days of Miracles has
[57:35] passed there's no such a thing as Divine
[57:38] Healing
[57:39] there's no Holy Ghost
[57:41] it's because you're refusing to come out
[57:43] of the must and the dens of the devil
[57:46] and of the hell and of seeing and of
[57:50] pride
[57:51] walk in the light of the Gospel
[57:55] which will bring you warmth
[57:58] oh how comfortable it is
[58:01] to see the oncoming judgments and feel
[58:04] that Comfort feeling of the Holy Spirit
[58:07] hear them talk of atomic bombs and just
[58:11] think what's happening
[58:13] a peace that passes understanding while
[58:16] the bomb won't no more go out of the gun
[58:18] until we will be in the presence of
[58:20] Jesus
[58:21] for the eternal life we owe people back
[58:24] young again
[58:26] the baby's up to an age with no more
[58:28] death or sorrow
[58:31] oh what a wonderful thing
[58:34] you mean a man would refuse to come out
[58:36] and walk in that
[58:38] there's something wrong with him
[58:41] finally if he doesn't get the sunlight
[58:43] he turns pale
[58:46] it gets real pale sick sets in on him
[58:49] that's what's the matter with the world
[58:51] today that's what's the matter with the
[58:53] most of our churches today
[58:55] We are Becoming anemia
[58:58] we need a blood transfusion
[59:02] pale because we are failing our
[59:05] spiritual health is failing us we don't
[59:08] have the Zeal no more to hunt Souls
[59:12] to warn people
[59:15] to get our neighbors to get our friends
[59:17] the Milkman the paper boy whatever it is
[59:20] get someone to the Lord Jesus
[59:24] we're pale
[59:26] failing to walk out in the light because
[59:28] it's our privilege
[59:30] failing to believe in the health of God
[59:32] by Divine Healing I'm told in the Bible
[59:35] there will be a time come for those who
[59:37] are not in this wonderful sunlight
[59:40] thousands of the air will eat the Flesh
[59:42] of them that diseases is on this road
[59:46] that the doctors will never be able to
[59:48] stop
[59:49] it's the plagues of God
[59:52] the Egyptians doctors which was Far
[59:54] smarter than ours today could not stop
[59:56] the plagues of God neither could they
[59:58] sue Sayers or their impersonators it
[1:00:01] took the ocean and the power of God to
[1:00:04] hold his people
[1:00:05] under the blood of a lamb
[1:00:08] the holy spirit is that door today
[1:00:12] the holy spirit is at safety today
[1:00:17] I was in a meeting not long ago I'm
[1:00:19] looking at a
[1:00:20] a colored brother sitting here
[1:00:23] I suppose him and his wife and I've been
[1:00:26] watching since I've been preaching
[1:00:27] nodding his head and rejoicing in the
[1:00:30] meeting it just brought me to a a
[1:00:33] thought there's a boy come into the
[1:00:35] meeting one time
[1:00:36] and as soon as the service is over he he
[1:00:39] ran to me and he said Parson he was a
[1:00:42] southerner and he said Parson
[1:00:45] as wants to find the law Jesus tonight
[1:00:50] us having a healing service
[1:00:52] and I said certainly my brother
[1:00:56] I am more than happy to lead you to him
[1:01:01] he said actually he gave his heart to
[1:01:03] the Lord
[1:01:04] he said I wonder I guess you're
[1:01:06] wondering why I run up out here like
[1:01:08] this that I heard you were in the city
[1:01:10] and I just come up to see what to see
[1:01:13] you
[1:01:14] he said I'll tell you my story
[1:01:16] he said I've more or less been a Wonder
[1:01:18] said my own mother was a real Christian
[1:01:22] my sisters was Christian I had one
[1:01:24] Christian brother he said I was the baby
[1:01:27] of the family and a spoiled child to
[1:01:29] begin with because a baby in me but
[1:01:31] still good to me but said I would not
[1:01:33] take heed to my mother
[1:01:36] are my Godly relation I wanted to be a
[1:01:39] Wanderer I want to live a man's life
[1:01:42] he said I thought that being a Christian
[1:01:44] is more like for the women or the weak
[1:01:47] he said and I become a cook
[1:01:50] and I was very good at my period and
[1:01:53] said something another I want to go to
[1:01:55] the north and one day I staggered in on
[1:01:58] a pulp camp where they were cutting pop
[1:02:00] wood
[1:02:01] and I was broke
[1:02:03] and I said to the foreman could you use
[1:02:06] a cook he told his recommendations that
[1:02:09] he had in his pocket from different
[1:02:10] great places where he had been a chef
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:13] he said well we have one now
[1:02:16] he said but however until you're able to
[1:02:19] get around we can give you a little bit
[1:02:21] of money on the sun we got an elderly
[1:02:23] colored woman in there now which is a
[1:02:24] good chef but go and talk with her maybe
[1:02:27] she could use you and she could we can
[1:02:29] give you a little spending money till
[1:02:31] you get on your feet
[1:02:32] he said that was as good as he wanted
[1:02:34] and said he went in there and he met the
[1:02:37] old woman and said he helped her around
[1:02:38] for two or three days
[1:02:40] one night said he was laying there and
[1:02:43] he said he kept noticing the flashes
[1:02:45] across the side of the wall
[1:02:47] and after a while he wondered if that is
[1:02:50] somebody outside
[1:02:52] and said after a while he heard a a deep
[1:02:55] Roar
[1:02:57] and it was a thunder
[1:02:59] he said outside heard some voices
[1:03:01] talking
[1:03:04] and they said you know we better get
[1:03:07] back to the horses
[1:03:10] and take care of them because we may not
[1:03:13] be here very long
[1:03:17] said he took the cover off his head
[1:03:19] listened up to the wall and the
[1:03:21] lightning flashed and he saw his boss in
[1:03:23] the teamsters
[1:03:26] and he understood by their talk if there
[1:03:29] was coming a storm across the mountains
[1:03:31] which we call up in the Northlands
[1:03:34] a northerner comes quickly without
[1:03:37] warning
[1:03:39] you don't have time to do nothing the
[1:03:41] mountains are so high they just break
[1:03:43] right over at once
[1:03:45] and that flashing had been lightning
[1:03:48] and he said you know we may not be here
[1:03:51] after a while
[1:03:52] so that sounds like a terrible twister
[1:03:55] coming
[1:03:56] and then
[1:03:58] he said I begin to think well
[1:04:01] I hope it doesn't strike here
[1:04:04] said because I know I'm not ready to go
[1:04:08] and sometimes you wait too long you know
[1:04:12] so then he said just a few moments the
[1:04:15] wind began to blow and the trees begin
[1:04:18] to rock
[1:04:20] and said he listened
[1:04:22] the canvas was between he and worthy the
[1:04:25] old lady slept
[1:04:27] and said she was beating on that camera
[1:04:30] she said son or son
[1:04:33] he said yes
[1:04:35] she said would you come over to my son I
[1:04:38] have a lantern lit
[1:04:40] and said I went over to her because I
[1:04:43] was scared to death
[1:04:45] and said she had a laner sitting on an
[1:04:47] old soapbox and she said I'd like to ask
[1:04:51] you something
[1:04:52] said yes ma'am
[1:04:54] is that is you ready to meet the Lord
[1:04:58] he said then I really got scared
[1:05:02] said no ma'am I'm not well she said
[1:05:05] honey I want to tell you something
[1:05:07] you'd better make ready now
[1:05:11] cause you may have to meet him I'm
[1:05:14] prepared in the next few minutes
[1:05:17] said she said will you kneel with me
[1:05:19] here
[1:05:21] said we knelt down to the side of that
[1:05:23] old soapbox he said Parson I'm going to
[1:05:25] tell you the truth I still scared to
[1:05:27] pray
[1:05:29] he said the trees are slamming against
[1:05:31] that building and the lightning of
[1:05:33] flashing the Thunders and shaking
[1:05:36] I was too scared to pray I said I start
[1:05:40] to say Lord be merciful and bang with
[1:05:42] all the lightning I'd say what was that
[1:05:44] Lord be merciful obey with all the
[1:05:47] lightning
[1:05:50] he said but I learned a lesson
[1:05:53] he said that old sainted woman said
[1:05:56] Justice cool and happy as she could be
[1:06:01] said she talked to him like she had
[1:06:03] known him since she was a baby like he
[1:06:05] was her father or a mother
[1:06:08] said she was no more Disturbed and
[1:06:10] nothing
[1:06:12] said I was scared to death
[1:06:16] said finally I got these words out and I
[1:06:18] said Lord
[1:06:19] if you just let me live
[1:06:23] and I'll find a place where it's more
[1:06:25] quieter
[1:06:27] I'll come to you
[1:06:31] he got another chance but you might not
[1:06:34] when the judgments of God begin to pour
[1:06:36] out there's no more chance
[1:06:40] you've got your chance now
[1:06:42] this is your chance
[1:06:44] the storm was on him
[1:06:47] he said Parson
[1:06:50] is it possible for a man like me to be
[1:06:54] tucked away in that safety
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:06:59] and when death begins to come upon me
[1:07:02] that I can interrupt to talk to him like
[1:07:04] that Old Saint did
[1:07:07] I said Son the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:10] that made her that way can make you that
[1:07:12] way right now
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:15] I was standing by my automobile
[1:07:20] s found his knees in the muddy yard
[1:07:25] there he found that hiding place
[1:07:30] that refuge in a time of storm
[1:07:33] that rock in a weary land
[1:07:35] you don't have to be weary as long as
[1:07:37] you're in the rock
[1:07:39] the rock is one place that's not weary
[1:07:42] the rock is a satisfying place
[1:07:45] you can just sit back and look out
[1:07:48] just as safe as you can be
[1:07:52] there is our coming and now he is
[1:07:56] and the ceiling is about over
[1:07:58] that where every man and woman on the
[1:08:01] face of the Earth
[1:08:03] is going to be in that place of Refuge
[1:08:06] like it was in the days of Noah are on
[1:08:08] the outside of it
[1:08:10] you have to make your decision
[1:08:13] that safety is Jesus Christ
[1:08:16] that he is the only place the only one
[1:08:19] who has eternal life no man can come to
[1:08:22] the father but by him
[1:08:25] he is the Ark of our safety the Holy
[1:08:28] Spirit Bears record
[1:08:30] with us now that we pass from Death unto
[1:08:33] life and when we look at the grave and
[1:08:35] know that each one of us is going there
[1:08:38] we see the newspapers and the oncoming
[1:08:41] storm
[1:08:43] when you go home tonight do me one favor
[1:08:46] don't go to bed till you read
[1:08:48] Revelations the eighth chapter
[1:08:50] you see the oncoming plagues and storm
[1:08:56] that still hit the earth and Thunders
[1:08:59] and Lightnings are going to shake the
[1:09:01] heavens
[1:09:03] woes are going to pass over the nation
[1:09:06] man will rot in their flesh
[1:09:09] diseases of strike that the doctors
[1:09:11] knows nothing about
[1:09:14] but remember before that took place
[1:09:16] there was a ceiling went forth
[1:09:19] and the death angels and the plagues was
[1:09:23] commissioned by God don't come near any
[1:09:26] of those who has a seal in their
[1:09:28] forehead
[1:09:29] and the Seal of God is the baptism of
[1:09:31] the Holy Spirit
[1:09:33] Ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy
[1:09:36] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:09:38] until the day of your Redemption no
[1:09:41] matter how hard the art rocked no matter
[1:09:44] how many times the lightning struck
[1:09:46] close to ten thousand shall fall on your
[1:09:49] right and thousands to your left and it
[1:09:51] shall come not 90.
[1:09:53] the Holy Spirit
[1:09:55] I'll read about pale horse rider going
[1:09:57] out which is called death
[1:10:00] and Hell Followed him a black horse
[1:10:02] rider with a balance in his hand
[1:10:07] a measure of wheat for a penny two
[1:10:09] measures of body for a penny but don't
[1:10:12] come near my wine or my arm
[1:10:16] I hear by the Bible God's oncoming
[1:10:20] judgments or sickness and trouble and
[1:10:23] disaster will strike the nations in
[1:10:25] every nation will break to pieces I read
[1:10:26] in the Bible
[1:10:28] everything was quiet but the Lord Jesus
[1:10:30] peeled back the darkness from his eyes
[1:10:33] and he grabbed the mayor of the city and
[1:10:35] screamed I can see I can see
[1:10:40] one thousand standing there in
[1:10:42] muhammadans and so forth I said now what
[1:10:45] is the Ark of Safety
[1:10:47] I said I read in your paper the other
[1:10:49] day
[1:10:51] where did all the little birds that used
[1:10:54] to roost in the Rocks around the fence
[1:10:55] and in the big towers of the buildings
[1:10:57] of the corner
[1:10:59] you know what India is a poor country
[1:11:00] and they pick up the rocks on the field
[1:11:02] and make their fences
[1:11:04] and the little birds feel their nest in
[1:11:07] these rocks the crevices and then the
[1:11:10] holes they go into there and make their
[1:11:12] nests to get out of the rain
[1:11:15] and then the cattle all of an afternoon
[1:11:17] when the Sun goes across towards the
[1:11:19] West while the cattle stands in the
[1:11:22] shade of these uh these certain fences
[1:11:25] and big towers to get in the shade
[1:11:28] but for about two days the strangest
[1:11:31] thing happened
[1:11:33] all the little birds got their babies
[1:11:36] they're little baby birds
[1:11:38] all together and flew away from the
[1:11:41] walls and didn't even return back at
[1:11:43] night
[1:11:43] they went out in the middle of the field
[1:11:45] and set out
[1:11:47] the cattle would not come up in the
[1:11:49] afternoon
[1:11:51] they stayed away from the walls and got
[1:11:54] together
[1:11:55] and stood so close together that they
[1:11:57] made shade one for another
[1:12:01] brother sister that's what the church
[1:12:04] ought to do
[1:12:06] we don't need the shade of these
[1:12:09] towering bablens today of modernism we
[1:12:13] need the blessings of each other
[1:12:14] together
[1:12:17] love and Brotherhood
[1:12:20] Shadow brought in our heart by the Holy
[1:12:22] Ghost
[1:12:23] that makes this
[1:12:25] I take my brother by the hand
[1:12:27] my sister by the hand and know that we
[1:12:30] are citizens of the kingdom of God
[1:12:33] that we love one another and we stand
[1:12:35] together in this one great cause the
[1:12:38] cause of Christ whether you're a
[1:12:40] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian one to
[1:12:43] student is threeness whatever you are it
[1:12:45] makes no difference
[1:12:46] as long as the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] cleanses us from all sin and we have
[1:12:51] Fellowship one with another
[1:12:53] that's what we want Brotherhood
[1:12:55] Fellowship
[1:12:59] they stood in the fields they refused to
[1:13:01] stand in the shadow of the walls the
[1:13:04] people thought that was strange
[1:13:06] it is a strange Act
[1:13:08] what happened all of us
[1:13:11] all of us earthquake
[1:13:12] That Shook the walls to the ground
[1:13:16] if the little birds would have been in
[1:13:18] there
[1:13:19] they and their babies would have been
[1:13:21] like the woman her husband and her
[1:13:23] babies in Miami all right Okeechobee
[1:13:27] they would have died but the falling of
[1:13:29] the walls
[1:13:30] if the cattle would have stood around to
[1:13:33] take that support from the walls they
[1:13:36] would have perished with the walls
[1:13:39] that's been three years ago I've got the
[1:13:42] newspaper clip no Tommy Nichols has it
[1:13:44] now for the Christian man's voice
[1:13:47] the headlines in the paper
[1:13:49] says the birds are returning back to
[1:13:51] their places
[1:13:53] the cattle is coming from the field
[1:13:56] if the god in the days of Moses in the
[1:13:59] days of Noah
[1:14:02] could warn the cattle and the birds to
[1:14:05] come into safety
[1:14:07] in the ark destruction was coming a
[1:14:10] storm he's still the same God tonight
[1:14:15] he still loves cattle and birds
[1:14:18] and if he made a way for a bird and a
[1:14:20] cow to escape the wrath of judgment
[1:14:25] how much more has he made a way of
[1:14:28] Escape for you and I
[1:14:30] who are the offsprings of his creation
[1:14:33] how much more has it made a way of
[1:14:35] Escape for us
[1:14:37] we feel the Holy Spirit tugging at our
[1:14:39] heart
[1:14:40] the hour is coming we see the Shadows of
[1:14:44] the the atomic age we see the Shadows of
[1:14:47] the hazard and age we see nations are
[1:14:50] breaking
[1:14:53] Israel Awakening
[1:14:56] nations are breaking
[1:14:59] Israel's Awakening
[1:15:01] the signs that the prophets foretold
[1:15:05] the Gentile days numbered with Horrors
[1:15:08] encumbered
[1:15:10] return o disperse to your own
[1:15:13] that's the way today you all know
[1:15:15] Haywood's old song the day of redemption
[1:15:19] is near man's hearts are failing for
[1:15:22] fear be filled with the spirit your
[1:15:25] Lance trimmed and clear
[1:15:27] look up your Redemption is near the
[1:15:31] storms are coming there's a hiding place
[1:15:34] oh a blessed hiding place it's in Christ
[1:15:38] let us bow our heads just a moment
[1:15:50] I hope that
[1:15:53] you were moved the way I was
[1:15:57] now I want you to
[1:15:59] this is like
[1:16:02] a prophecy
[1:16:04] storms in Florida
[1:16:07] right
[1:16:10] what are they talking about now
[1:16:12] atomic bombs
[1:16:14] nuclear Russia
[1:16:19] everything so my question is tonight
[1:16:24] and and we're Believers but if I would
[1:16:28] ask you this
[1:16:30] and and you were to come with an answer
[1:16:36] what did the prophet warn us about
[1:16:42] okay see we can look at the blessings
[1:16:47] we can look at the teachings
[1:16:51] we can be excited about everything
[1:16:55] and just what he what he said
[1:16:58] and he and he said this he said people
[1:17:01] today are be comfortable he said they
[1:17:05] got prosperity
[1:17:06] we're we're preachers and we're
[1:17:09] Christians have been
[1:17:10] and programs of building this and doing
[1:17:13] that we have all those things he said
[1:17:16] but we've left off
[1:17:18] the main
[1:17:20] thing
[1:17:22] and this is what he said
[1:17:24] he says
[1:17:25] or you know what I mean and we've left
[1:17:29] off the main thing judgment
[1:17:31] righteousness the power of the Holy
[1:17:34] Ghost resurrection and eternal judgment
[1:17:39] and so I I just thought in my heart I
[1:17:43] couldn't believe how that so many things
[1:17:46] he was saying actually literally applied
[1:17:50] right to where we're at
[1:17:52] storm in Florida
[1:17:54] warning in nuclear trouble in every way
[1:17:57] everybody after entertainment
[1:18:00] lawlessness and then I sit back and I
[1:18:04] said
[1:18:05] how aware am I
[1:18:09] of what brother random
[1:18:11] warned us about
[1:18:13] am I am am I conscious
[1:18:17] and and been listening and understand
[1:18:22] what is he warning us about
[1:18:27] and it's very striking when you start
[1:18:31] going through and see what he warned
[1:18:35] what the church would be what they would
[1:18:38] start leaving off
[1:18:41] but things they wouldn't have in their
[1:18:43] gospel anymore
[1:18:45] and if he just and he warns it and and
[1:18:49] everybody's excited about this excited
[1:18:52] about that and they forgot the warning
[1:18:55] they forgot what he warned in so I I
[1:18:59] just thought tonight we've listened to
[1:19:01] the voice of the warning
[1:19:04] it behooves us to take it to our heart
[1:19:07] to listen to the preparation and
[1:19:11] understand
[1:19:13] with all our heart what it is that he's
[1:19:16] warning let's don't miss the warning it
[1:19:19] goes the warning goes with the blessings
[1:19:21] but let's be aware of what he warned us
[1:19:24] about and don't let anything sneak up on
[1:19:27] us or get us or or mysteriously when you
[1:19:32] hear the word of God
[1:19:34] is that preaching the main thing
[1:19:37] is it pointing to the voice of the hour
[1:19:39] is it letting us know there's a voice of
[1:19:42] judgment and a warning let's stay right
[1:19:46] with the word of God just the way it was
[1:19:49] brought to us and I think it was great
[1:19:51] did you enjoy that tonight I I certainly
[1:19:54] did I was amazed at
[1:19:58] you would have thought he was preaching
[1:20:00] this right today but that's a voice of
[1:20:02] warning
[1:20:04] he says what great does it do if he
[1:20:06] doesn't provide a place of safety and we
[1:20:08] have a place of safety it's the ark and
[1:20:12] that's the message of the hour God bless
[1:20:14] you let's stand together I hope it's a
[1:20:16] blessing I hope it's not too late
[1:20:18] tonight
[1:20:20] uh for the service but just a 48 or so
[1:20:24] minute message 42 minutes a very
[1:20:27] wonderful uh let's Bauer heads and and
[1:20:30] ask the Lord to bless us and maybe you
[1:20:33] ask yourself
[1:20:35] in your own heart this evening
[1:20:39] and you'd say Lord maybe I've got a
[1:20:41] little Lacks
[1:20:44] and I forgot that there's a warning
[1:20:47] I I've I forgot to look around it to see
[1:20:51] the signs of the time
