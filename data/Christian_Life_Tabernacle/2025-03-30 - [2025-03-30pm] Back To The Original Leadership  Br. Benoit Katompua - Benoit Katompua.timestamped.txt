[46:06] this morning Lord you're worthy of our
[46:09] surrender Lord Jesus father you're
[46:11] worthy of all things
[46:13] father we think back as when John was
[46:16] looking to see if there was anybody that
[46:19] was worthy that could take the book lord
[46:22] loose the seals therein father for he
[46:25] knew the importance of an open book Lord
[46:27] Jesus we wouldn't be here Lord if it
[46:30] wasn't for that Lord but thanks be to
[46:32] God the elders told them weep not for
[46:36] Behold a lion of the tribe of Judah
[46:38] here's one that's worthy Lord Jesus
[46:41] father you took our place Lord Jesus you
[46:43] became our sin that we might be your
[46:46] righteousness father teach us Lord and
[46:48] help us Lord to surrender more father to
[46:51] give of ourselves more Lord to let you
[46:54] have the preeminence Lord Jesus put us
[46:57] aside father foolishly we think we have
[47:00] something to play but truly Lord there's
[47:03] nothing that we can do outside of give
[47:05] up Lord Jesus for you know the perfect
[47:07] will you know the perfect work father it
[47:09] is your Plan of Redemption it is all
[47:12] yours from beginning to end Lord Jesus
[47:15] you knew before the foundation of the
[47:16] world your children would be gathered in
[47:18] this house tonight Lord Jesus you knew
[47:20] who would be here Lord and you knew who
[47:23] wouldn't have the ability to make it
[47:24] back lord Jesus but for father I count
[47:27] Lord Jesus that because you made
[47:29] preparations for it that there is a
[47:31] blessing to them Lord that have made the
[47:33] sacrifice to be in your house Lord Jesus
[47:36] father they didn't come to hear from a
[47:37] man Lord Jesus but they came to hear
[47:39] from you Lord set me aside Lord anoint
[47:42] my lips father and speak something to
[47:44] your people Lord Jesus these are the
[47:46] ones you died for Lord Jesus these are
[47:49] the ones you give of yourself for father
[47:51] you took the beating Lord Jesus you took
[47:54] the nails father for these people Lord
[47:56] Jesus we weren't good Lord Jesus we
[47:58] weren't deserving of it father but you
[48:01] found favor in US Lord Jesus you gave us
[48:04] grace and mercy Lord Jesus how we thank
[48:07] you for that father Lord our heart's
[48:09] desire is that our lives may be found
[48:11] worthy Lord Jesus help us in this
[48:14] journey in this walk father we leave the
[48:17] remainder of this time in your hands
[48:18] Lord you know what they have need of
[48:21] Father minister to each one father let
[48:23] not one leave from this place without
[48:25] something Lord Jesus
[48:27] not from a man Lord but from you Lord
[48:30] Jesus we thank you Father we ask all
[48:32] these things we want to remember our
[48:33] pastor once more Lord
[48:35] Jesus he's a warrior Lord father
[48:39] strengthen him Lord Jesus we love him
[48:42] Lord we appreciate him and all that he
[48:44] does for the body Lord Jesus we pray
[48:47] prayer for all those that are out making
[48:49] the way back from Oklahoma Camp Lord I
[48:52] pray Lord that they may come back with
[48:54] something
[48:55] greater than just a good time father but
[48:59] let it be a word
[49:00] change that will cause them to never be
[49:02] the same again Lord that's our heart's
[49:05] desire we ask all these things in the
[49:07] wonderful precious mighty name of the
[49:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[49:12] amen if you'll turn with me thank you
[49:16] musicians to Matthew
[49:22] 16 I really enjoyed what our pastor
[49:25] preached this morning amen
[49:29] excuse me I thought it'd be he'd give us
[49:31] a part two
[49:33] but you know I'm I'm up
[49:37] here
[49:40] but the Lord knows what he
[49:42] does and he knows why all I can come
[49:46] here to tell you
[49:47] is the effect of the word in my
[49:51] life I can't give you anything else
[49:54] outside of how he deals with me
[49:57] amen we surely appreciate our
[50:01] pastor
[50:05] let's we'll start in the 24th verse of
[50:08] Matthew 16 the scripture reads then said
[50:13] Jesus unto his disciples If any man will
[50:16] come after me let him deny himself and
[50:19] take up his cross and follow me for
[50:22] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[50:24] it and whosoever
[50:27] will lose his life for my sake shall
[50:30] find it for what is man profited if he
[50:33] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[50:35] own soul or what shall a man give in
[50:38] exchange for his soul let's turn again
[50:42] to Isaiah the 64th chapter we'll just
[50:46] read
[50:48] verse believe the 6th
[50:53] verse it reads
[51:06] one moment I lost
[51:09] myself here it reads but we are all as
[51:12] an unclean thing and all our
[51:15] righteousness are as filthy rags and we
[51:18] all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities
[51:20] like the wind have taken us away may the
[51:23] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[51:25] his word you may be seated
[51:29] seated if I were to title this little
[51:32] thought I I won't be
[51:35] long let me get my my clock
[51:39] out we're going to shoot for 30
[51:42] minutes if we're less praise the
[51:47] Lord but if we're long praise him
[51:50] anyways
[51:58] as I was thinking about what our pastor
[52:00] preached this morning the path forward
[52:02] is the way back I got to
[52:04] thinking you know brother Brandon's
[52:06] talking about how uh a man would look at
[52:09] himself and think that he's got a better
[52:12] suited way he's got a better suited path
[52:15] for himself rather than relying on Jesus
[52:18] Christ and it it got me pondering you
[52:20] know when you go back and you look at
[52:22] how it was in the beginning when Jesus
[52:24] Christ was first here and how he made
[52:27] man brother Brandon would say he made
[52:28] man to completely be dependent on him
[52:32] and the problem was when Adam fell was
[52:35] Adam had what brother Brandon would
[52:37] describe as unconscious
[52:39] Faith there was no thought in what he
[52:42] spoke what he spoke was so in line with
[52:45] the things of God because there was no
[52:47] reasoning behind it everything was the
[52:50] mind of God the thoughts of
[52:52] God that's what's been restored back to
[52:55] us in this day and we look when he would
[52:58] call the disciples one by one each of
[53:01] them had a convocation had work
[53:03] something that they were doing and what
[53:05] he had to do was when he called them
[53:07] they had to leave that convocation
[53:09] whatever the work that they were doing
[53:11] and completely follow him they
[53:13] surrendered everything they were fully
[53:15] trusting for him to provide for what
[53:16] they would have need of what they would
[53:18] eat where they would sleep imagine
[53:21] following a man you know we look in in
[53:23] this time those that followed brother
[53:24] brandom sure you had you know you had
[53:26] hotels and motels you probably could
[53:28] have stayed at or family friends that
[53:30] you knew and so forth but imagine
[53:32] walking miles on miles on Miles with the
[53:37] same pair of
[53:39] shoes the effects it would have on your
[53:41] feet the the Mind battle you may have in
[53:44] your mind do I really do I really have
[53:46] to follow this man man he 300 miles
[53:50] that's a distance goodness me man that's
[53:53] far oh do I really have to drive 25
[53:56] minutes to get to church that's a long
[53:57] time do I oh man you know what I'm only
[54:01] 15 minutes away you know I I I'll start
[54:04] getting ready five minutes before I have
[54:06] to leave and then I'll get there you
[54:08] start looking at the attitudes that we
[54:10] have because of the Comforts that we
[54:11] have it's a bit different from that
[54:13] which they had that's right right it it
[54:15] meant something to leave not all not all
[54:18] the disciples were maybe married but
[54:20] some of them were and you're leaving all
[54:23] of that to follow a man you're unpacking
[54:26] but in this day and age for some reason
[54:28] we have the idea that if we follow
[54:30] Christ or we fully surrender to the
[54:32] leadership of Christ that we've got a
[54:34] part to play that we've got to pack
[54:36] certain things that we've you know I
[54:37] want to add this I I want to take this
[54:40] part away I want to do this this is my
[54:42] part to play but this is we have to
[54:45] fully surrender Ambitions plans goals
[54:49] idea everything is a surrender it's a
[54:51] complete trust in
[54:53] him I I've always enjoyed when when
[54:56] Billy Paul would give testimonies about
[54:57] brother Brandon one of the testimonies
[54:59] that always struck me he said daddy
[55:01] didn't always have somewhere to stay he
[55:03] said daddy didn't always have a suit he
[55:05] said Daddy would sometimes sleep in his
[55:07] car that's the cost this message was
[55:10] given to us I wonder what price we pay
[55:13] what sacrifice we make if that's how it
[55:16] came how do we expect to continue on any
[55:19] other way but the
[55:21] sacrifice sometimes it'll get
[55:23] uncomfortable sometimes you may not like
[55:25] it the taste of this preacher I just
[55:28] don't like the his Cadence the way he
[55:30] speaks I I just don't like but is the
[55:32] word being spoken to You Are we more
[55:35] focused on how it's being delivered
[55:37] rather than the matter itself that's
[55:39] where we start getting in
[55:42] trouble I got I got to
[55:47] thinking we today imagine this is the
[55:50] only I guess I would say for those that
[55:52] fly a lot this is the only trip where
[55:54] the itinerary is nothing
[55:57] nothing and if you're a person that
[55:59] likes to plan everything to the detail
[56:03] on a trip man trips like this are
[56:06] hard cuz you don't know what you'll
[56:09] need like I'll say you won't know what
[56:12] you'll
[56:14] need you won't know what you'll need how
[56:18] could you trust in that like imagine I
[56:20] told you hey let's take a trip we're
[56:22] going to go
[56:23] to Western give me a give me a country
[56:28] India we're going to go to
[56:30] India yes man we're going to go to India
[56:34] and I say don't pack
[56:36] anything we're going to completely trust
[56:39] God to provide everything that we have
[56:41] need of where we'll stay in fact how
[56:45] we'll get
[56:46] there I'll give you my card it's got 0
[56:50] on it but your faith will get on that
[56:54] computer you'll put in information and
[56:57] it'll pull the exact amount you have
[56:59] need of for the trip it's like brother
[57:02] you're kind of insane what are you
[57:03] talking about I need preparations man I
[57:06] got to make sure that I I see the
[57:08] money's there that I can count it one
[57:11] two three you mean nothing I've I've got
[57:15] nothing I'm supposed to completely rely
[57:17] though I can't see anything completely
[57:20] have faith that a God would lead me
[57:22] somewhere that I didn't understand and
[57:25] he would provide EX exactly what I had
[57:27] need of yes that's the kind of God we
[57:30] serve we've gotten
[57:33] lazy I speak of myself here where we
[57:37] have to see
[57:39] something we can't no longer trust God
[57:43] blindly if God puts an unction on your
[57:45] heart to do something we have to reason
[57:48] it out until it makes sense in our mind
[57:52] we won't
[57:54] move well at that point you've missed
[57:56] the
[57:58] purpose imagine a prophet getting off
[58:00] that plane going to that
[58:03] woman Parson that was waiting for you
[58:05] how'd you know I was a
[58:07] persons what was he trusting in what was
[58:10] he walking in he didn't know all he knew
[58:13] he got off his plan he's turn right turn
[58:16] left he's just completely listening to
[58:20] what the spirit is telling him to
[58:23] do but us and and this is what
[58:27] fascinated me with what our pastor
[58:28] preached this morning our path forward
[58:30] is the way back and then brother Brandon
[58:33] would talk all the days of our
[58:36] life it brought me to this quote in the
[58:39] marriage of the land brother brandom
[58:41] says the next thing A promise is made
[58:44] and there has to be a promise made to
[58:46] one another paragraph
[58:48] 85 like that you make a promise
[58:50] sweetheart if you'll marry me I promise
[58:52] that I'll be loyal and true I will look
[58:54] upon No Other Woman
[58:56] or I'll look upon no other man and I'll
[58:59] do all that as a duty as a wife we have
[59:03] children it'll do all as a duty as a
[59:06] mother I'll be a housekeeper all these
[59:09] promises has got to be made or should be
[59:12] in a correct wedding and that's the same
[59:15] thing when you come to Christ Lord if
[59:17] you ever receive me into your kingdom I
[59:19] promise there you
[59:21] are I'll love you I'll be true to you
[59:26] I'll serve you day and night it's too
[59:29] bad we forget that see when a prophet
[59:31] says something like that you know so you
[59:33] got to step back what am I
[59:36] forgetting what what are these
[59:38] commitments that I made to
[59:40] God oh my brother told me a story once
[59:44] he had a vehicle he goodness
[59:47] me okay so I promised that I'd be short
[59:50] and um we're going to um yeah so the
[59:55] brother made a
[59:56] promise he said Lord if you give me a
[1:00:00] vehicle I will be in church every time
[1:00:03] the doors are
[1:00:06] open there was no way for him to get a
[1:00:09] vehicle but he got a car by the grace of
[1:00:13] God and for as long as he was in the
[1:00:16] house of the Lord that car never broke
[1:00:20] down the moment he stopped the car
[1:00:24] started having issues
[1:00:28] that's an example what about us Lord if
[1:00:32] you save me if you take me out of this
[1:00:35] circumstance and situation I'll never be
[1:00:38] found here again Lord if you save me if
[1:00:41] you heal me because brother brandham
[1:00:43] said we have to have a purpose for our
[1:00:45] healing there's got to be a motive anded
[1:00:47] behind it it can't just be so that I can
[1:00:50] glory in my own healing no why do you
[1:00:53] want to be saved why do you want to be
[1:00:56] healed why do you want to be delivered
[1:00:58] there's got to be a purpose behind
[1:01:01] it the prophet of God will say God
[1:01:04] doesn't just save you and put you on a
[1:01:06] shelf there's a job for you to do
[1:01:10] there's something you must
[1:01:12] do how often we forget some of the
[1:01:15] promises we
[1:01:17] make he says it's too bad we forget that
[1:01:20] I'll serve you day and night I'll fast
[1:01:24] I'll pray
[1:01:26] I'll be loyal to you I'll bring tithings
[1:01:29] to the storehouse I'll pray many times a
[1:01:32] day I'll do anything and I'll pledge all
[1:01:36] my love to you that's what you should do
[1:01:39] that's exactly right where you promised
[1:01:42] that and it should come from your
[1:01:46] heart then he says that's what two in
[1:01:50] paragraph 117 that's what too many
[1:01:51] so-called Christians do sharing your
[1:01:54] love with the world
[1:01:56] playing dancing gambling staying home
[1:01:58] from prayer meetings to watch television
[1:02:01] all kinds of worldy things that took
[1:02:03] place that took the place of the love of
[1:02:05] God in the church's heart she's gone on
[1:02:08] a tantrum she's gone wild she's gone out
[1:02:12] after other men she is sharing her love
[1:02:14] she'll take her tithing that she should
[1:02:16] give to the church she'll spend it on
[1:02:18] other things out there in the world
[1:02:20] she'll instead of instead of loving God
[1:02:23] the way she should do and living for God
[1:02:25] and loving to come to
[1:02:29] church you almost have to persuade her
[1:02:32] to
[1:02:34] come remember this
[1:02:37] is focusing on what our pastor preached
[1:02:40] about man thinking he has the right idea
[1:02:43] he cre he'll create his own religion
[1:02:45] that fits
[1:02:46] him Lord I I you got me every Sunday
[1:02:50] morning you got me every
[1:02:53] Wednesday but Sunday night
[1:02:56] I I need me
[1:02:58] time I just got to relax you know I got
[1:03:01] to be up early at 6:00 a.m. to go to
[1:03:04] work I don't know a God that you
[1:03:08] sacrifice come into his house that he
[1:03:10] doesn't bless on the other hand if you
[1:03:13] do please let me know because the only
[1:03:15] God that I know is when you sacrifice
[1:03:18] everything for him all that you have
[1:03:20] need of somehow Finds Its way to you
[1:03:28] talking about a complete surrender if I
[1:03:30] were to title this thing I'd title it
[1:03:32] back to the original
[1:03:34] leadership because I I got to looking at
[1:03:37] myself because that's all you can do not
[1:03:40] oh I know that brother he don't come to
[1:03:42] church oh I know that sister man she
[1:03:44] just something else no this is
[1:03:48] you just it's you and God imagine this
[1:03:51] is a building that's empty and it's just
[1:03:54] you and him
[1:03:56] when something strikes don't attach it
[1:03:58] to someone else make it personal for you
[1:04:03] sometimes I feel we come to church for
[1:04:04] other
[1:04:06] people I got to show them that I know
[1:04:08] how to
[1:04:09] worship I got to show them that I know
[1:04:11] what I'm talking about but then you look
[1:04:13] at your personal life in your own walk
[1:04:16] and something's lacking the leadership
[1:04:19] isn't there the complete surrender isn't
[1:04:23] there this is the only race going
[1:04:26] forwards is going
[1:04:28] backwards you got to step back sometimes
[1:04:32] look at the big picture like our Pastor
[1:04:33] said this morning it's not the quick
[1:04:36] winds the fast winds it's
[1:04:38] longterm it's an investment to be in his
[1:04:41] house it's an investment to be in the
[1:04:43] word because when times get tough you've
[1:04:46] got something to pull from but if you
[1:04:49] haven't made the right investments in
[1:04:51] the right things now you're stranded in
[1:04:53] a trial and you've got nothing to draw
[1:04:55] from
[1:05:01] from this this this this quote
[1:05:04] just stood out to me so much one
[1:05:10] moment see that's the nature of man he
[1:05:13] wants his own way God did not make man
[1:05:18] to desire his own way God made man to
[1:05:22] depend on him to forsake his ways to
[1:05:27] crucify his way he likened us unto sheep
[1:05:32] you don't have to raise your hands but I
[1:05:34] believe everybody in this room at some
[1:05:38] point had something they wanted to do
[1:05:41] that God said not to do yet you did
[1:05:45] it why is that because you reasoned it
[1:05:49] out and you saw no issue with the
[1:05:53] matter but we don't see from from what
[1:05:56] perspective God's looking
[1:05:58] at it's like the scripture that says
[1:06:00] would you you got to think about if your
[1:06:03] if your son asks you for bread would you
[1:06:04] give him a
[1:06:07] snake not every good
[1:06:10] gift catch what I'm saying not every
[1:06:13] good gift is meant for
[1:06:19] you ask for all the
[1:06:23] blessings God will give you exactly what
[1:06:25] he planned to give
[1:06:27] you if this person here has amassed this
[1:06:30] amount of wealth does not mean it'll be
[1:06:32] the same thing for you but what you can
[1:06:35] trust is that regardless of what they've
[1:06:38] amassed and what you have at the end of
[1:06:41] the matter when the book is finally
[1:06:43] closed the destination's the
[1:06:46] same you have to completely have faith
[1:06:50] in God there's nothing you can do we
[1:06:54] we're in a society today where people
[1:06:57] have drummed up in their mind that I'm
[1:07:01] I'm a believer I'm going to believe in
[1:07:04] Christ but I'll I need this degree in
[1:07:08] order for me to get that job that I'm
[1:07:10] looking
[1:07:11] for I'm not I'm I'm not speaking against
[1:07:14] education if that's the path God set for
[1:07:16] you praise be to God go ahead in that
[1:07:18] path what I'm saying is you've made it a
[1:07:21] crutch something that you rely on it's
[1:07:25] not education that produces the job it's
[1:07:29] God that produces the job because you
[1:07:31] can find one that's lacking and one that
[1:07:34] has the degree but the one that's
[1:07:35] lacking has a higher position than the
[1:07:37] one that has it why is that because
[1:07:40] God's no respector of person you're his
[1:07:43] favorite when you ask for something
[1:07:46] though it may seem impossible to you he
[1:07:48] grants it why he's the good father he
[1:07:52] knows exactly what you have need of and
[1:07:55] when when you have need of it you make
[1:07:57] it ask you cry Lord I've sighed and
[1:07:59] cried all my life I just can't seem to
[1:08:02] pass this certain amount of income per
[1:08:04] year I I just I don't know how I can get
[1:08:06] across to that other side I don't and
[1:08:09] and your entire life you start fixating
[1:08:11] on that thing and you fail to the
[1:08:14] purpose of this life is not for
[1:08:17] income the purpose of this life is for
[1:08:20] us to get out of here we don't want to
[1:08:23] just be focused on man I got to make
[1:08:24] this next dog I got to make this next
[1:08:26] dollar you'll lose sight of
[1:08:29] everything we have a one trck mind on
[1:08:32] the things of God I love what our Pastor
[1:08:35] said it's not work Life Church Life this
[1:08:38] life no I'm doing everything unto the
[1:08:42] Lord if I can't do it unto the Lord I
[1:08:45] probably shouldn't be doing it if school
[1:08:48] starts taking up your time for
[1:08:52] God look into why that is maybe you take
[1:08:57] till the last minute to get assignments
[1:08:59] done and then the Lord suffers you know
[1:09:03] I got this assignment d man you know
[1:09:05] this do at 11:59 when did you get it two
[1:09:07] weeks
[1:09:09] ago oh I can't come to church man I just
[1:09:12] it's it's dude I have to do it you know
[1:09:14] what I mean like this is a part of my my
[1:09:16] path I have have to get there don't let
[1:09:18] the Lord suffer because of your
[1:09:21] procrastination do those things today
[1:09:24] don't put them off for tomorrow I you're
[1:09:28] the number one procrastinator is the one
[1:09:30] that's speaking to
[1:09:32] you I have a gift of doing things last
[1:09:36] minute I almost believe doing it last
[1:09:39] minute gets the best
[1:09:42] results but then my Time Slips Away the
[1:09:46] focus changes you put things off so much
[1:09:49] brother the BL say something good during
[1:09:51] our youth meeting now you're just
[1:09:52] putting out
[1:09:53] fires you put this Sol so long maybe
[1:09:57] it's a two-minute task you say you know
[1:09:59] what it's 2 minutes I'll do it four
[1:10:00] minutes before it's due that's
[1:10:03] right and then you have a computer issue
[1:10:06] and now you're oh man how do I get this
[1:10:09] Miss uh yeah man my computer it wasn't
[1:10:11] working so I wasn't able to get the
[1:10:13] assignment done when did you realize it
[1:10:14] wasn't working ah you know about three
[1:10:16] minutes
[1:10:18] ago like we we got to be real with
[1:10:21] ourselves sometimes we do the same thing
[1:10:24] in our spiritual life life it's your
[1:10:27] duty to feed it's your duty to pray it's
[1:10:31] not right when your world is crumbling
[1:10:34] down then you start Lord how many hell
[1:10:36] mares can I make in a moment Lord help
[1:10:38] me Lord help me Lord help
[1:10:39] me it's it's lazy
[1:10:42] living you prepare for trouble when
[1:10:46] trouble's not
[1:10:48] there that's when you
[1:10:50] prepare it's not when the trouble arises
[1:10:53] now I have to get ready at that point
[1:10:55] you're late you've
[1:10:58] lost we want to be led by God we want to
[1:11:02] go back to that original leadership but
[1:11:05] bam describes it unconscious faith that
[1:11:09] word fascinates me because I'm
[1:11:13] conscious how do you have unconscious
[1:11:16] Faith you completely remove your own
[1:11:19] Ambitions and goals you fully engulf
[1:11:22] yourself in the word in so much when you
[1:11:25] speak it's only the things of God it's
[1:11:28] not your ideas it's not your thoughts
[1:11:31] but it's him he comes in you and he
[1:11:34] lives the
[1:11:36] life I've been looking at the story
[1:11:39] of vashy of
[1:11:42] Esther and it just it it fascinated me
[1:11:46] what a good read this is why it's
[1:11:48] important to read your Bible because you
[1:11:50] start seeing things when you take the
[1:11:52] time and you can apply it to your life
[1:11:55] you
[1:11:56] notice Esther was not given anything
[1:12:00] special compared to all the other
[1:12:03] virgins that were brought forth they all
[1:12:06] had access to the exact same thing it
[1:12:10] just so happened the king's Chamberlain
[1:12:13] hegi said this is what's been given for
[1:12:16] you to Adorn yourself now there are
[1:12:18] plenty of other things that you could
[1:12:20] ask for and it'll be given to you
[1:12:22] everyone else started getting googly
[1:12:24] eyes ooh maybe I can add this maybe I
[1:12:27] can do this you know what man if I jump
[1:12:30] this High then yeah yeah I've got
[1:12:32] something this one over here man if I
[1:12:34] just learn to speak in tongues the right
[1:12:36] way if I just learn how to do this you
[1:12:38] start trying to add things rather than
[1:12:41] just take what the king gave you and
[1:12:44] here Esther when it comes to her turn
[1:12:47] she says you know I don't want anything
[1:12:50] outside of what he's requesting and she
[1:12:53] put that on my Bible tells me it's been
[1:12:56] given to us that righteous clothing for
[1:12:59] us to Adorn ourselves in our problem is
[1:13:03] we want to add but our righteousness is
[1:13:06] as filthy rags we want to add things to
[1:13:09] make us more righteous rather than just
[1:13:11] take what he said and live by it and
[1:13:15] it's because of that when he went unto
[1:13:17] the king the scripture says she found
[1:13:20] favor and
[1:13:23] Grace the law was WR written she could
[1:13:26] not enter into the king's chamber there
[1:13:28] was a
[1:13:30] law but because she found favor and
[1:13:33] Grace when there was be when it became
[1:13:35] life or death she said either I will
[1:13:40] perish that's that's a different kind of
[1:13:42] Faith she knew where she stood at that
[1:13:45] point she knew she had his favor she
[1:13:48] knew she had his grace there was a time
[1:13:51] where we couldn't enter into the holies
[1:13:52] of holies because of our sin because of
[1:13:55] our unrighteousness and the way we were
[1:13:58] but a price was paid now it's life and
[1:14:01] death if you don't get into the holies
[1:14:03] of holies there's certain death we must
[1:14:07] enter in how do we enter in not by The
[1:14:10] Works that I can do not by anything that
[1:14:12] I could muster up but solely by
[1:14:17] surrendering father have your way what
[1:14:19] would you have me do today
[1:14:27] brother Randon makes this statement he
[1:14:29] says I know that makes people hate me
[1:14:32] sometimes but you'll love me when I meet
[1:14:35] you over Yonder I'll tell you the truth
[1:14:39] it's a foundation no matter what it cost
[1:14:43] you'll be sincere and tell the truth
[1:14:46] recognize it to be God be holy for I am
[1:14:50] Holy he said quit living in sin
[1:14:55] he's describing the story here of a
[1:14:57] young
[1:14:58] man that went
[1:14:59] away and he left a woman with a vow with
[1:15:03] a promise of
[1:15:05] something he says these people would go
[1:15:08] drink and carry on it's in sermon
[1:15:10] hearing re receiving and acting
[1:15:12] paragraph 223 these people would go out
[1:15:14] and drink and carry on but one young man
[1:15:17] they noticed that young man he didn't
[1:15:20] carry on like
[1:15:22] that he didn't carry on like that he
[1:15:25] lived clean at night time he come home
[1:15:27] and went to bed he lived like a
[1:15:30] gentleman should live and one day the
[1:15:32] old caretaker said I like to take a walk
[1:15:34] with you son he said all right they
[1:15:37] started up the hill walking together
[1:15:38] towards the setting of the Sun and he
[1:15:40] said young fellow you can came over with
[1:15:43] that Bunch you came over with that bunch
[1:15:44] of Americans didn't you and he said yes
[1:15:47] sir I did he said I want to ask you
[1:15:49] something he said 'all right he saidh
[1:15:51] why is that you don't go out and drink
[1:15:53] and carry on' laying out with the girls
[1:15:56] and things all through the night and
[1:15:57] coming the next morning way they do he
[1:16:00] stopped put his arm around the old man
[1:16:02] he said you see the way the Sun is
[1:16:05] setting Yonder in the west he said yes
[1:16:07] sir I do he said beyond that setting of
[1:16:08] the sun there's a certain state in New
[1:16:10] England State and said in that certain
[1:16:12] state is a certain city and in that
[1:16:14] certain city is a certain house in that
[1:16:16] certain house is a certain girl and that
[1:16:18] girl I vowed before I came here to be
[1:16:21] true to her that when when I return
[1:16:23] we're going to be married she he made a
[1:16:25] vow to me a promise therefore sir all my
[1:16:30] attention is attracted as far as it
[1:16:33] comes to woman towards that girl at that
[1:16:35] place and he said I live today for
[1:16:39] tomorrow to come what a testimony see
[1:16:43] that struck me I live today for tomorrow
[1:16:47] to come that means the decisions I make
[1:16:50] today is with the end goal in mind
[1:16:53] nothing that I make as far as decision
[1:16:56] idea is separate from the end goal if
[1:17:00] the end goal is Rapture every decision
[1:17:03] must reflect Rapture if the end goal
[1:17:06] whatever the end goal is make decisions
[1:17:09] towards that goal our problem is we make
[1:17:12] we say we have an end goal but then we
[1:17:15] look at the decisions we make and
[1:17:17] something's not matching the puzzle
[1:17:20] piece doesn't come together we say we
[1:17:23] want God
[1:17:25] but will
[1:17:28] compromise we're talking about
[1:17:30] leadership a complete surrender back to
[1:17:34] the
[1:17:35] original I want complete surrender in my
[1:17:39] life you know that Devil comes into your
[1:17:41] mind I I got to thinking about
[1:17:44] this trying to make yourself
[1:17:48] righteous trying to get yourself
[1:17:51] there so you start I got to do this I
[1:17:55] got to do that I got to move here I got
[1:17:57] to go there and you start doing all
[1:17:59] these things and at first you attribute
[1:18:04] that to the Christ in
[1:18:07] you it's the Christ in me that's trying
[1:18:10] to do all these things but my my my
[1:18:13] Bible tells me something different it
[1:18:16] says it's it's his
[1:18:17] work he's the one that calls and draws
[1:18:21] he's the one it's not me trying to get
[1:18:24] there it's him getting me there but in
[1:18:27] the process of me trying to get there
[1:18:29] then you get that voice in the back of
[1:18:30] your mind that starts to tell you you
[1:18:33] know you're unworthy you know you can't
[1:18:36] make it you've got too many faults too
[1:18:39] many mistakes people know about you that
[1:18:41] you know your sins you know what you did
[1:18:44] last night you you know who you really
[1:18:47] are you know what you watch you know how
[1:18:49] you speak you know how you talk with
[1:18:50] your friends the crowd you hang around
[1:18:53] you're nothing you're not not going to
[1:18:55] make it what's that
[1:19:00] voice it's not anything that it's saying
[1:19:03] is
[1:19:04] wrong in fact it's telling you the truth
[1:19:08] it's telling you who you
[1:19:10] are that it is attached to but that
[1:19:15] voice can't reach the real you you can
[1:19:18] only speak to that real you by the word
[1:19:21] because it only responds to the word it
[1:19:23] doesn't respond to your vain
[1:19:26] efforts it's no different when brother
[1:19:29] bandam dealing with that woman from from
[1:19:31] that time and she goes well brother
[1:19:32] bandam I tried I tried to do right you
[1:19:34] know I I I gave my life I stood up I
[1:19:36] said I turned a new page i' done all the
[1:19:39] said young lady
[1:19:42] no the devil's stronger than you think
[1:19:46] this is not about your effort you need a
[1:19:49] touch from him what you need is an
[1:19:51] experience something that's an anchor
[1:19:54] and she she got down on her knees and
[1:19:56] she was praying she said Lord Lord Lord
[1:19:57] and cried out and cried out and stood
[1:19:59] back up and said brother B I'm going to
[1:20:00] be different today watch a prophet he
[1:20:03] says you've done the same thing every
[1:20:06] time what has it gotten
[1:20:09] you it's not about you turning the page
[1:20:13] see that's what the devil puts in your
[1:20:14] mind no you can fix this you can make
[1:20:17] this right you can't fix this that's why
[1:20:20] he had to
[1:20:22] die but it it got to a Point butam says
[1:20:26] the devil is stronger than you think God
[1:20:28] has to come in your life and remove him
[1:20:30] before he ever entered you talk about
[1:20:33] Justified and never did it in the first
[1:20:35] place that's what it was and when she
[1:20:38] got down to pray brother said he saw her
[1:20:40] get deeper in
[1:20:42] sincerity when she got up that time it
[1:20:46] wasn't brother Bram I'm going to be
[1:20:47] different she said brother brandom
[1:20:50] something happened what we need in this
[1:20:54] hour
[1:20:55] is something happened I've got the guide
[1:20:59] on the inside this is different from
[1:21:02] before this isn't Ben trying to get it
[1:21:04] there this isn't Ben trying to make
[1:21:06] himself ready no no no this is something
[1:21:08] else I feel something on the inside
[1:21:11] that's stronger than me that's pulling
[1:21:14] me I don't know where that thing came
[1:21:16] from but all I know it's
[1:21:19] right I maybe I ought to follow it just
[1:21:21] a little while and you watch when you
[1:21:23] start listening to that voice and follow
[1:21:25] that voice it'll get you to where you
[1:21:28] are trying to
[1:21:30] go oh no but I'm young I got
[1:21:33] time I don't have to give my life I I

[1:22:19] people on this
[1:22:22] planet they're enslaved up here thinking
[1:22:26] they're doing right thinking they're
[1:22:27] free when in fact they can't think for
[1:22:30] themselves everything that's fed to them
[1:22:33] is straight from the pits of Hell
[1:22:35] there's no greater freedom I don't care

[1:24:01] die more Die daily a true death you wake
[1:24:06] up in the morning and you take the time
[1:24:09] it it struck me if you just get alone
[1:24:12] with God and you say Lord I'm not
[1:24:13] leaving till you touch me if we started
[1:24:17] our day like that every single day I
[1:24:20] find it really hard for us to have hard
[1:24:23] times not saying they will lack but the
[1:24:26] hard time won't be so hard because
[1:24:28] you'll be you'll know who's on your side
[1:24:30] and you'll recognize this is just for a
[1:24:31] season this is just for a moment he's
[1:24:34] getting a character out of me he's doing
[1:24:36] something I may not see it I may not
[1:24:38] understand it but I'm trusting in his
[1:24:42] leadership we get no
[1:24:45] man I want the easy life I got the Holy
[1:24:50] Ghost I'll never struggle
[1:24:52] again I'll pay all my bills on
[1:24:56] time I'll never be a dollar
[1:24:59] short and then when it happens you begin
[1:25:02] to think to yourself man I've gone
[1:25:05] astray oh Lord why have that forsaken
[1:25:09] me because you're short a dollar why is
[1:25:12] Thou forsaken me Lord oh I wanted to go
[1:25:15] to that trip and I couldn't do it why is
[1:25:16] Thou forsaken
[1:25:18] me my goodness I wanted that car why is
[1:25:21] th forsaken
[1:25:22] me when one stood up there with
[1:25:25] nail-pierced
[1:25:26] hands for you and
[1:25:29] I between us who is really the one that
[1:25:32] was
[1:25:33] forsaken he paid a price he didn't know
[1:25:37] for you and
[1:25:38] me and he wants to come in you and lead
[1:25:42] you and guide you into all truth and
[1:25:46] righteousness and we fight at that we
[1:25:49] don't want to give into that because our
[1:25:52] first
[1:25:53] nature Desir us to be in
[1:25:56] control we have to die to this man he's
[1:25:59] not your friend people worshiped brother
[1:26:03] brandom they really worshiped him and
[1:26:06] you know what bothered him when he stood
[1:26:07] up there one day and said you want me to
[1:26:09] tell you my greatest enemy
[1:26:13] is brother
[1:26:16] Brandon man I I thought he was a good
[1:26:18] dude man I man I was following him and
[1:26:20] now he's telling me he's his enemy man I
[1:26:22] don't know what to do now
[1:26:25] we do everything can you imagine we
[1:26:27] pamper this flesh we'll give this flesh
[1:26:30] the best
[1:26:31] food you'll work it out if you if you
[1:26:36] decide you'll do whatever I want I want
[1:26:39] this these eyes to see the best things
[1:26:40] in the world I want to go this place and
[1:26:42] see all these beautiful sites you we
[1:26:45] pamper this flesh so much and give every
[1:26:49] single little desire that it
[1:26:52] has and it's our greatest en
[1:26:56] enemy that man that that one's always
[1:26:59] troubles me cuz if you don't pamper it
[1:27:02] and you don't feed it it
[1:27:05] dies but the more I feed it it's killing
[1:27:09] me I have a law in my members I got to
[1:27:13] feed this dead
[1:27:16] man but the spirit man on the inside the
[1:27:21] real you the one that's separate from
[1:27:23] this flesh man try feeding him a little
[1:27:27] while see if he doesn't take over the
[1:27:30] problem is we feed this outside man too
[1:27:32] much we pamper him too much starve him
[1:27:35] sometime and just feed that inner man I
[1:27:39] wholeheartly believe if you lacked
[1:27:40] something to eat physically and you said
[1:27:43] Lord I'm going to read this scripture
[1:27:46] this will be my
[1:27:47] meal if we had the faith and that's the
[1:27:50] problem it's just a concept now you say
[1:27:54] that somebody says man I let him try it
[1:27:57] if I'm hungry I'm
[1:28:00] eating just try it for a second does the
[1:28:03] word not say oh taste and see that the
[1:28:05] Lord is good try it for a moment and see
[1:28:08] if he do do it I know what it means to
[1:28:11] have nothing and completely rely on him
[1:28:14] to produce something and he does
[1:28:17] it but if I could just get him
[1:28:19] to if I could just get that same Bend in
[1:28:22] those moments to be every time
[1:28:24] life would be so much easier if I could
[1:28:27] have the same faith for everything and I
[1:28:31] fully relied on him life would be so
[1:28:33] much easier I we want to make a Rapture
[1:28:37] that's the path forward we want to be
[1:28:39] mature we want to have authority but the
[1:28:43] greatest man that ever had Authority had
[1:28:47] leadership he didn't have unchecked
[1:28:50] power God never gives a man unchecked
[1:28:52] power so this idea that I'm this all
[1:28:55] powerful being when I see Satan I'm
[1:28:56] going to cut his head
[1:28:59] off no if that's not your battle you'll
[1:29:03] walk right past the
[1:29:05] situation you said well that's not
[1:29:07] possible man me I'm a warrior if I see
[1:29:09] sin I'm going to fight sin but Jesus
[1:29:12] walking in the pool of Bethesda walking
[1:29:15] past all those that needed him went to
[1:29:18] one imagine that what everyone everyone
[1:29:21] was thinking that knew who this man was
[1:29:23] you're the Healer I don't need this pool
[1:29:25] you're the one that blessed this
[1:29:28] pool and he walks right past you you oh
[1:29:32] man I've prayed and
[1:29:33] I I don't know why I don't know why I'm
[1:29:37] I I'm here but you struggle you lack you
[1:29:41] need
[1:29:42] something the money is not always making
[1:29:45] its its ends me you know I I I
[1:29:48] wholeheartly believe Within Myself
[1:29:51] Lord if I'm the poorest man on the
[1:29:53] planet Planet as long as I've got you
[1:29:57] you know that's got to be more than just
[1:29:59] a statement we make that's got to be
[1:30:02] real because when a prophet says even if
[1:30:05] he sends me to hell I'll love him
[1:30:08] still I want that to be my
[1:30:11] testimony regardless of the circumstance
[1:30:13] and condition I find myself in father
[1:30:16] I'm attaching myself to you not because
[1:30:18] of how much you can bless me but because
[1:30:21] this life only exists because of you
[1:30:24] you that's why I love you if we chose
[1:30:28] Partners only for the sake of what they
[1:30:30] could do for us and it wasn't love what
[1:30:33] happens when a medical crisis comes
[1:30:34] about and they can't do that thing
[1:30:37] anymore then what keeps you we need real
[1:30:42] love for God that regardless of the
[1:30:45] trials that I have to face regardless of
[1:30:47] how tough times get you're still the
[1:30:49] same I love you more today than I loved
[1:30:52] you yesterday in the of the trial I love
[1:30:56] you there was I had a foolish moment the
[1:30:59] beginning of this
[1:31:00] year Miss snitch on myself here foolish
[1:31:04] moment I'm looking I'm like man Lord I I
[1:31:07] got this idea I want to I want to do
[1:31:09] this with business I want to do that I
[1:31:12] had these deals that came to me I said
[1:31:15] oh it's God that brought me these deals
[1:31:17] this is the Lord man all this money I'm
[1:31:19] about to make oh my goodness that's
[1:31:22] God and right when things seemed as if
[1:31:24] they were going to hit they were going
[1:31:26] to strike you know I was in my room
[1:31:28] alone crying I said Lord I've never
[1:31:32] lived a life that knew this the fact
[1:31:35] that you could give this to me Father
[1:31:37] regardless of whether I have it or not
[1:31:39] I'll love you and serve you the same see
[1:31:42] I didn't realize what I was saying
[1:31:44] because they all fell through not a
[1:31:47] single one hit now you're standing and
[1:31:50] said didn't you make that statement you
[1:31:52] serve me regard
[1:31:56] wasn't that you that said that was it
[1:31:58] not you that said Lord if you heal me
[1:32:00] out of this situation I'll give my
[1:32:02] entire life to you wasn't it you that
[1:32:04] said Lord remove this lust from my life
[1:32:07] and I'll serve you wasn't it you that
[1:32:09] said Lord if you heal me I'll be in your
[1:32:12] house every time wasn't it you that said
[1:32:14] Lord get me out of this relationship
[1:32:16] Lord and I'll serve you all the days of
[1:32:18] my life we make all these promises and
[1:32:20] all these statements but when the rubber
[1:32:21] meets the road where are we
[1:32:24] and there I had to confront myself
[1:32:27] because I made a statement and God
[1:32:29] challenged that
[1:32:30] statement do you really love me if you
[1:32:33] have nothing do you really love me if I
[1:32:36] if I don't if I don't give you what it
[1:32:37] is you think is
[1:32:39] yours we need true leadership one that's
[1:32:42] not bound by results whether you get
[1:32:45] them or not but one that completely
[1:32:47] trust in the headship says Lord you know
[1:32:50] what's best for me you know the season
[1:32:52] of my blessing you know the the season
[1:32:54] of all things and whether he gives it to
[1:32:56] you or not you love him the same it's
[1:33:00] not because you do this then I'll love
[1:33:02] you it's not because no it's Lord I love
[1:33:05] you that's it why because you first
[1:33:09] loved me and you purchased my
[1:33:13] salvation it it moved me so much this
[1:33:17] morning I I got to find this quote
[1:33:24] I trust that the church will understand
[1:33:26] this that we have no right to use our
[1:33:30] own thinking about things when we become
[1:33:33] Christians we fully surrender every bit
[1:33:37] of our mental powers to God and follow
[1:33:41] after his
[1:33:43] leading do you know what the end of it
[1:33:46] all will be yes I'll make a
[1:33:50] Rapture but
[1:33:52] how I don't know
[1:33:54] all I know the one that said I'd make it
[1:33:57] will guide my feet guide my hands he
[1:34:00] will be my stay he will be my strength
[1:34:03] in the times of weakness he's my
[1:34:05] strength in the times of Sorrow he's my
[1:34:08] comforter in the times of trial he's my
[1:34:12] deliverer the same one that made the
[1:34:14] promise of the end has enough power to
[1:34:16] get you to the end we need to step back
[1:34:20] and surrender and say Lord lead me
[1:34:24] not lead me like this but Lord lead me I
[1:34:30] have no thoughts no Ambitions no plans
[1:34:35] outside of what your word says if it
[1:34:37] can't be found in your word I don't want
[1:34:39] it I want the kind of leadership that
[1:34:42] you wake up in the morning you read the
[1:34:44] word and it said you know I got to call
[1:34:46] this person and let him know something
[1:34:48] the Lord has a blessing for this person
[1:34:51] why because you're now you care about
[1:34:53] others you're out of your own mind
[1:34:55] you're out of your own situation and you
[1:34:57] can start living for other people that's
[1:35:00] what the word The Life of Christ was
[1:35:02] living for others leadership brings you
[1:35:05] to death of self we want to lead so bad
[1:35:09] but we don't want to die you can't lead
[1:35:11] nobody if you're still in charge that's
[1:35:13] right you have to be a man under
[1:35:16] Authority not a man with authority I'm
[1:35:19] under Authority I only do that which he
[1:35:22] tells me to do I only speak that which
[1:35:24] he tells me to say nothing more and
[1:35:27] nothing less if we live that kind of a
[1:35:30] life if Ben would just get out of the
[1:35:31] way long enough and fully surrendered to
[1:35:35] God he'd live an overcoming life every
[1:35:37] day of his
[1:35:40] life if the musicians would
[1:35:45] come brother Ram says in paragraph
[1:35:48] 35 and if a man will just come that
[1:35:51] close to God that when when you're lost
[1:35:54] you don't try to find your way back just
[1:35:57] surrender to him and he'll lead you back
[1:36:01] don't try to figure it out that's the
[1:36:03] mental
[1:36:06] Powers father teach me not to figure
[1:36:09] things out teach me to just fully trust
[1:36:13] in you you have the answers you know how
[1:36:17] I'll get out of this I may not
[1:36:21] know this may not be
[1:36:24] oh man isn't the sermon I was expecting
[1:36:27] this isn't what I I wanted God to speak
[1:36:29] to
[1:36:29] me but I think it's high time we all
[1:36:33] died to what we
[1:36:35] expect and just fully surrender into
[1:36:38] what God has
[1:36:40] planned if we got out of the way long
[1:36:42] enough and just took what he gave us
[1:36:44] when he gave us we would live a more
[1:36:47] peaceful life let's be like
[1:36:50] the disciples following Christ
[1:36:54] no thought just fully trusting in his
[1:36:58] leadership and what he has planned
[1:37:00] that's a challenge I place for
[1:37:02] myself and one I ask you to join me
[1:37:06] with do you want to fully
[1:37:09] surrender remove all thoughts that you
[1:37:12] have all expectations you
[1:37:15] have it's funny we'll give God old
[1:37:19] tomats if I don't get this job I'm
[1:37:21] leaving
[1:37:24] if I don't if you don't give me this I'm
[1:37:27] gone who brought you
[1:37:30] here who got you here can he not keep
[1:37:34] you so what you don't get that
[1:37:38] job there's one better coming if this is
[1:37:42] where he wants you regardless of how
[1:37:45] tough things seem right
[1:37:48] now this is where you'll see the
[1:37:50] blessing made manifest in your life
[1:37:54] make decisions with God in mind not our
[1:37:58] pockets in
[1:37:59] mind let's
[1:38:14] stand let's just pray
[1:38:23] gracious Heavenly
[1:38:30] Father Lord I Thank
[1:38:33] you for a message that's got all the
[1:38:36] vitamins that this body needs
[1:38:40] Lord everything I've ever hoped
[1:38:43] for everything I've Ever Needed
[1:38:46] everything I've ever wanted is found in
[1:38:49] your word
[1:38:50] Lord you gave us a prophet Lord Jesus
[1:38:55] and he's came with a message from you
[1:38:57] Lord that showed us how to fight how to
[1:39:01] walk how to talk how to
[1:39:03] live he told us never let a negative
[1:39:06] thought come into your
[1:39:08] mind only speak
[1:39:10] positive persevere if God gives you a
[1:39:14] vision of something don't
[1:39:15] move if it's with his words you stay
[1:39:18] right there and you'll see it come to
[1:39:20] pass he showed us the example time and
[1:39:23] time again Lord of that unmoving Faith
[1:39:26] Lord the kind that Abraham had that
[1:39:28] didn't move
[1:39:30] Lord and when all was taken from him his
[1:39:34] wife his
[1:39:36] baby and he was there
[1:39:38] alone he felt
[1:39:41] alone he said the devil couldn't tell me
[1:39:43] God wasn't
[1:39:46] real he knew I knew
[1:39:48] better all he could tell me was that God
[1:39:50] didn't love me
[1:39:53] and right when he was about to just say
[1:39:56] whatever the flesh man
[1:39:59] desired that leadership on the inside
[1:40:02] came forth and said the lord giveth the
[1:40:05] lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[1:40:07] the
[1:40:08] Lord father how often that's us Lord
[1:40:12] things don't work out the way we want
[1:40:14] and we're just so ready to give up and
[1:40:17] say I can't go on much longer
[1:40:20] Lord but father we need that thing on
[1:40:22] the inside side that rises up and says
[1:40:27] it's good that I can't go on longer
[1:40:29] because he's taken me all the way
[1:40:33] through help us Lord
[1:40:35] Jesus we want to be fully surrendered
[1:40:39] Lord if we ever desire to be mature
[1:40:43] Christians True Believers Lord we've got
[1:40:47] to learn to deny ourselves
[1:40:49] Lord help us Lord Jesus
[1:40:53] not everything that pleases the eyes is
[1:40:55] meant for you
[1:40:56] Lord teach us Lord to be content with
[1:40:59] that which we have
[1:41:01] Lord teach us Lord truly to be content
[1:41:05] with what we have
[1:41:08] father it doesn't hurt to have faith for
[1:41:10] other things Lord
[1:41:12] Jesus but father if we can't be faithful
[1:41:16] in the least we'll never be faithful in
[1:41:19] much

[1:45:58] every all and
[1:46:03] your is what I long
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:10] for you have
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:15] G
[1:46:16] life to
[1:46:20] me Hallelujah I trust you enjoy that
[1:46:23] tonight amen the orinal leadership
[1:46:27] that's what we want to be returned
[1:46:30] to It Wasn't Man leading man and it
[1:46:32] wasn't man trying to lead God it was God
[1:46:36] leading man you know you that's that was
[1:46:40] the original
[1:46:42] Church man has taken it and the prophet
[1:46:45] will talk about how they've St
[1:46:49] substituted substituted the leadership
[1:46:51] of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:53] and now they have men telling them what
[1:46:55] they should do oh you should do this you
[1:46:58] should dress this way you should do if
[1:47:00] you don't have the Holy Spirit leading
[1:47:02] you inside that instruction will never
[1:47:05] be of no good in fact you will find
[1:47:08] yourself under the law and the only time
[1:47:11] you'll do it is just when you fear what
[1:47:14] that man said to you but God is looking
[1:47:17] for a different kind of leadership the
[1:47:19] same leadership that he they directed
[1:47:22] Adam with the same leadership that we
[1:47:24] saw in Jesus Christ in fact Jesus told
[1:47:28] them he said it's it's expedient for you
[1:47:31] that I go because if if I'm here every
[1:47:34] time something happened you're going to
[1:47:36] run oh Master what are we going to do
[1:47:38] Master Cast Away that one do this over
[1:47:41] here so everything it was a master
[1:47:43] master but there came a change of
[1:47:45] leadership on the day of Pentecost where
[1:47:48] the master who was with them now was in
[1:47:51] them and and now they didn't need to run
[1:47:54] and ask because the master was right in
[1:47:57] them doing the same thing that he did
[1:47:59] that's the Church of God that's the
[1:48:01] church that the Lord is looking for men
[1:48:04] and women that are being empowered and
[1:48:07] endued with power on from on high
[1:48:10] wherever they are they are a unit to
[1:48:12] themselves they are the very Life of
[1:48:14] Christ being manifested I love what but
[1:48:17] Ben said it said mention you know
[1:48:20] and I guess with age you you you kind to
[1:48:23] kind of come to see this we we have this
[1:48:27] type of Christianity that's like from a
[1:48:30] microwave you know you pray two minutes
[1:48:32] and God will do and it's all about power
[1:48:35] and demonstration and it's all about you
[1:48:38] know just power power
[1:48:40] power well the same God that has power
[1:48:43] it's the same God who was manifested in
[1:48:45] the ox it's the same God who was
[1:48:48] manifested in the spirit of the human he
[1:48:50] was the same God who manifested himself
[1:48:52] in the spirit of the eagle the same God
[1:48:55] who was a lion butam says those four
[1:48:58] beasts they're the ones that guard the
[1:49:04] throne in other word God is not looking
[1:49:07] for us to just be here every time I go
[1:49:09] on my knees I ask and then it comes to
[1:49:11] happen then I know God is with me no the
[1:49:14] the maturity of a Believer is like
[1:49:17] Shadrach mesach and Abednego whether he
[1:49:21] saves us or not we'll stand here and
[1:49:23] will obey the word whatever happens I
[1:49:27] know is with me the love of God is
[1:49:29] manifested in the fact that he's already
[1:49:32] told us he loves
[1:49:35] us God doesn't need to do one more thing
[1:49:39] for us to know he loves us he already
[1:49:41] says it said it so we can go on from
[1:49:45] here till Rapture and be be completely
[1:49:48] convinced that he's he loves us he
[1:49:52] doesn't need to do one more
[1:49:54] thing but we know he promises goodness
[1:49:57] will walk with
[1:50:01] us so we as Believers especially in the
[1:50:05] end time the maturity of a Believer is
[1:50:08] though he sends me to hell I'll still
[1:50:10] love him the maturity of the Believers
[1:50:13] to come to a place where you know the
[1:50:15] trials and the things that are
[1:50:17] encompassing you and everything is to
[1:50:19] build a character that is fit for you to
[1:50:22] live tomorrow we read that quote is
[1:50:25] building you up for what's coming
[1:50:27] tomorrow he has a place for you he has a
[1:50:30] role for you to play in the Kingdom the
[1:50:32] scripture says the J the just shall
[1:50:34] judge the Earth how can they judge
[1:50:37] without the
[1:50:40] character The Life of Christ we saw that
[1:50:44] character manifested in Christ I do
[1:50:46] nothing except what the father people
[1:50:49] mocked him and laughed at him and looked
[1:50:51] at him and called him all kinds of names
[1:50:53] he never responded and he just went
[1:50:56] about the father's business and
[1:50:58] everything and he was satisfied with the
[1:51:01] leadership of the father may we tonight
[1:51:04] be satisfied with that original
[1:51:06] leadership I really enjoy that just in
[1:51:09] within my own life I said God let me
[1:51:11] just be satisfied you know men we live
[1:51:14] in a time where men don't want to walk
[1:51:16] alone they just have to have a group of
[1:51:18] people with them you know all the time
[1:51:20] and you know your strength is just in
[1:51:22] numbers when we are many then you are
[1:51:25] but when you find yourself is that
[1:51:26] leadership still there you know in
[1:51:29] church we can do all things are
[1:51:32] possible but is everything possible when
[1:51:34] you find
[1:51:37] yourself it's not just the god of the
[1:51:39] church is the god of the
[1:51:41] individual we bring our licks of fires
[1:51:44] but he wants us to be the same as we are
[1:51:47] here tonight the same as we find
[1:51:49] ourselves when we are alone in the world
[1:51:53] because he promis you will be with us
[1:51:55] and if it's not in us don't don't take
[1:51:58] yourself and say oh no we heard it this
[1:52:00] morning I I it was really striking to
[1:52:03] myself even when I find myself in my own
[1:52:06] wrong all the confessions and everything
[1:52:09] I'm doing is still my own
[1:52:15] righteousness man is
[1:52:17] dangerous the heart of man is extremely
[1:52:20] dangerous now how could could we have
[1:52:23] ever known all of this except be for the
[1:52:25] revealed word of God how could we have
[1:52:28] ever even seen the depths of our own
[1:52:30] deception except God send a man to come
[1:52:33] and tell us those
[1:52:35] things I desire your leadership Lord I
[1:52:38] don't want anything of myself I want you
[1:52:41] to lead me to guide me everything I I
