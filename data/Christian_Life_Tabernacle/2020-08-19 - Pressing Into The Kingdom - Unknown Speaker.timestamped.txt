[31:09] lord we realize that the more that we
[31:11] live in this world that

[31:16] desire to
[31:17] be transformed from day to day and to be

[31:28] and we believe that we'll get it by
[31:30] hearing the word of god and
[31:32] by praying and by doing what you've
[31:34] asked us to do lord

[31:37] in your word that we're two or three i
[31:39] gather under my name i'll be in the
[31:41] midst
[31:41] we gather here because you said it's

[31:49] that you come down and fulfill your part
[31:51] we commit everything we are to you and
[31:53] pray that you forgive us of our
[31:55] shortcomings lord and
[31:57] father anything that we've done that's
[31:58] not pleasing to you we ask that the
[32:00] blood of your son may cover us of all
[32:02] uncleanness
[32:04] speak to us now as we commit ourselves
[32:06] back to your hands
[32:07] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[32:09] pray and ask amen
[32:10] amen it's good to be gathered in the
[32:12] house of god amen let's just open our
[32:14] bibles
[32:15] to colossians
[32:19] chapter 3.
[32:54] amen and we're going to read verse 1
[33:00] through 4 he says
[33:04] if he then be risen with christ
[33:09] seek those things which are above
[33:12] where christ sitteth in on the right
[33:15] hand of god
[33:16] so he's telling us if we are born of
[33:18] christ if we are raised with christ
[33:21] we need to seek those things which are
[33:23] above
[33:24] and it says set your affection on things
[33:28] above
[33:28] and not on things after the earth for ye
[33:32] are dead
[33:32] and your life is head with christ
[33:36] in god said when christ
[33:39] who is our lives who is our life shall
[33:41] appear
[33:42] then shall we appear with him in glory
[33:46] amen also if you could turn to
[33:48] philippians we're going to read two
[33:50] scriptures in philippians let's start
[33:52] with philippians chapter three
[34:05] we're going to start from verse seven it
[34:07] says
[34:08] what what things were gained to me those
[34:11] i count
[34:12] lost for christ he said yeah doubtless
[34:15] and i count all things
[34:17] but lost for the excellency of the
[34:20] knowledge of christ
[34:22] of christ jesus my lord for whom i have
[34:25] suffered
[34:26] the loss of all things and do count them
[34:29] do count them by done but i may win
[34:32] christ it says but be and be
[34:36] and be found in him not having my own
[34:39] righteousness
[34:40] which is of the law but that which is
[34:43] through the faith of christ the
[34:44] righteousness which is
[34:46] which is of god by faith
[34:49] that i may know him and the power of his
[34:52] resurrection
[34:53] and the fellowship of his suffering
[34:55] being made
[34:56] conform conformable unto his death
[35:01] if by any means that i might attain unto
[35:03] the resurrection of the dead
[35:06] not as though that i've already attained
[35:09] either we're
[35:09] already perfect but i follow after
[35:13] if i may apprehend for what
[35:16] for for which i also i'm apprehended of
[35:20] christ jesus brother and i count not
[35:23] myself to have apprehended
[35:25] but one thing i do one thing i do
[35:28] forget the forget those things which are
[35:30] behind
[35:31] and reach forth unto the things which
[35:35] are before a price toward the mark
[35:39] for the price of the high calling of god
[35:43] in christ jesus let us therefore
[35:46] as let us therefore as many
[35:49] as perfect be dust-minded
[35:52] and this that's where i want to give my
[35:54] thought tonight to
[35:56] to have the same mind he said let's have
[35:58] this mind let's be dust-minded
[36:00] and if anything if anything ye be
[36:03] otherwise minded god shall reveal
[36:06] even this unto you nevertheless where to
[36:10] we have already attained
[36:12] let us walk by the same rule
[36:16] let us mind the same thing
[36:19] amen and let's turn back in philippians
[36:22] chapter 2
[36:23] verse 5. a very familiar scripture
[36:25] reading it says
[36:27] let this mind be in you which was also
[36:29] in christ
[36:30] whom being in the form of god thought it
[36:33] not robbery to be equal with god
[36:35] but made himself of no reputation and
[36:38] took upon him
[36:40] the form of her servant and was made in
[36:42] the likeness of
[36:43] man and being found in fashion as a man
[36:47] he humbled himself and became obedient
[36:51] unto death and even the death of the
[36:54] cross
[36:56] wherefore god also had highly exalted
[36:59] him
[37:00] and given him a name which is above
[37:02] every name
[37:04] that at the name of jesus every knee
[37:06] shall bow
[37:07] of things in heaven and things on earth
[37:10] and things under the earth
[37:12] and that every thong should confess
[37:16] that jesus christ is lord to the glory
[37:18] of god the father
[37:20] amen may the lord that blessing to the
[37:21] reading of his word you may have your
[37:23] seeds amen
[37:27] amen
[37:35] man we're not going to try to be too
[37:37] long tonight
[37:38] just a few minutes to
[37:42] say a few words um
[37:47] and and i'll just to profess this i'll
[37:49] say that this is
[37:51] i was uh sunday as our pastor was
[37:54] speaking about thirst and
[37:55] and and i began to just uh
[37:59] i think on uh on this particular
[38:04] verse of the scripture where paul is
[38:06] speaking about pressing towards the mark
[38:09] and as we read that thirst is a painful
[38:11] desire
[38:12] something within your heart and you know
[38:14] if this doesn't happen i'll die
[38:17] and therefore because there was a thirst
[38:19] in him the thirst created the
[38:21] the desire to press on to move forward
[38:24] to
[38:25] to see whatever he was thirsting for
[38:27] achieved
[38:28] and so as we read the paul is speaking
[38:30] here and say that i pray towards the
[38:32] mark of the high calling
[38:34] and and he's basically laying before us
[38:37] that
[38:38] uh he has a goal and an objective in his
[38:40] life
[38:41] he has something that is pressing
[38:43] towards he
[38:44] has something that he wants to see
[38:46] happen but random tells us that a
[38:48] christian
[38:49] is one that has an objective we don't
[38:52] just
[38:53] go through life and i was even thinking
[38:56] you know
[38:57] none of us can sit here and say that
[38:59] success
[39:00] is something you stumble upon by by
[39:02] accident
[39:03] success is something that's carefully
[39:05] planned and something that after you've
[39:08] learned many mistakes and
[39:09] after you know diligently of sick and
[39:12] continue to do after something
[39:14] that's how a person sees success and i
[39:17] believe
[39:17] even as paul was speaking here of course
[39:20] we read the scripture where he speaks it
[39:22] says i don't count myself if i pre-ended
[39:24] yet
[39:25] and and i and i don't even i have this
[39:28] calling and i have this thing that
[39:30] has been presented to me and i know of
[39:32] my own righteousness that i have learned
[39:34] towards by the law and the things that
[39:36] were shown unto me
[39:38] the things that he had believed before
[39:40] and i said now i'm having to
[39:42] take all of that to having to take
[39:44] everything that he had learned
[39:45] by knowledge by law and all of that to
[39:48] put it aside so i can pursue this
[39:50] new uh a righteousness
[39:54] that was by faith that was shown unto me
[39:56] to christ
[39:57] that i may follow after that so he had
[40:00] he was
[40:00] no doubt standing at the place where he
[40:03] was uh
[40:04] realizing that the things which he he
[40:07] learned by the law
[40:08] that the very things which he thought he
[40:11] understood and he went and he
[40:13] himself was uh one who applied those
[40:15] things
[40:16] because the scripture says that even as
[40:18] stephen was being stoned
[40:20] that his clothes were at the feet of uh
[40:22] paul that he was there
[40:24] applying and believing that what he was
[40:26] following
[40:27] was true but yet he come to a place
[40:29] where christ himself came and revealed
[40:31] to him
[40:31] himself to him and he came into the
[40:34] realization that
[40:35] the things that which i was following
[40:37] after was not the real thing
[40:40] and christ revealed himself to him he
[40:42] says paul paul
[40:43] i am christ i am jesus him who that
[40:46] persecuted
[40:47] now paul knew that he was not persecuted
[40:50] he was persecuting the disciples
[40:52] he knew that he was going after these
[40:54] people that he called
[40:56] fanatics and the people which were going
[40:58] around and
[41:00] spreading the gospel and doing all these
[41:02] things in the name of jesus
[41:04] he was following after with the
[41:06] knowledge that he was doing the word of
[41:07] god
[41:08] with the knowledge that what he was
[41:10] doing was the will of god
[41:12] but when he met the pill of fire he came
[41:14] into the realization that
[41:15] all of those things meant absolutely
[41:17] nothing
[41:18] they was going the wrong direction and i
[41:21] believe that this
[41:22] tonight as we as we gather here we we
[41:24] have come to the realization
[41:26] that in some point in our lives we were
[41:28] following things
[41:29] that were of vain glory things that
[41:31] didn't add up to anything
[41:33] and the revelation of christ in our life
[41:36] has caused us to follow
[41:37] after different things and as paul
[41:40] speaks here
[41:41] he says i pressed towards a mark in
[41:43] other words he had a target
[41:44] something that he was trying to attain
[41:46] to this revelation this christ who was
[41:49] revealed to him
[41:50] this jesus whom he was persecuting who
[41:53] made himself known unto him
[41:55] became his target and to the excellency
[41:58] that i may know him more
[41:59] and the power of his resurrection that i
[42:01] may see him reveal it
[42:03] that i may come to the knowledge of him
[42:05] and he he came as he
[42:07] speaks in philippians and other places
[42:09] that i realized that i was dead and i
[42:11] was
[42:12] i was resurrected in christ and the life
[42:14] i live is not mine it's christ
[42:16] alone so he became all about this
[42:19] mark or this revelation that he had
[42:21] received
[42:23] so as we continue on we realized that
[42:26] he it became a preoccupation of his life
[42:29] and
[42:30] and i will say this everything about
[42:33] paul
[42:33] even about his life to that point
[42:37] everything that he had done and
[42:38] everything that he was about
[42:40] all everything that he did in his life
[42:43] everything added
[42:44] to this goal of his that he was running
[42:47] towards
[42:48] everything that he pursued and all his
[42:51] ambitions
[42:52] and everything that he wanted to achieve
[42:54] everything added together
[42:56] to the pressing of this mark that he
[42:59] wanted to see
[43:00] and and and no doubt we could sit here
[43:03] tonight and recognize that
[43:04] uh we could say that paul was a
[43:06] successful christian
[43:08] because we can see where he says i
[43:10] pressed towards the mark and
[43:11] we could see where he went through his
[43:13] life and then later on we read in the
[43:15] bible
[43:16] it talks about where paul himself now is
[43:18] coming it says
[43:19] that i have run my course and i've run
[43:21] my race and
[43:22] i've come to the end of my race and i
[43:24] know a crown of righteousness
[43:26] await for me so in other words we could
[43:28] see where he started and how he started
[43:30] and what he was pressing
[43:32] after and and the desires of his heart
[43:34] to see those things come and
[43:36] what he was winning the success that he
[43:38] wanted to see
[43:39] and after that we see him come to a
[43:41] place where he was
[43:42] uh uh uh he had faith within his heart
[43:46] and a strong belief
[43:47] that everything that he had followed
[43:49] after will reward him with the crown
[43:53] and and we don't have to go through life
[43:55] even as christians we come to the
[43:56] realization
[43:57] that god has not left us to where uh we
[44:00] do all that we can in this life and we
[44:02] live all kinds of life that we want to
[44:04] or we do all the best that we can and at
[44:07] the end we wait for him to wait
[44:09] our efforts and our everything that we
[44:11] did and find out if we actually going to
[44:13] get a crown or not
[44:15] that's not how the bible is written then
[44:17] if we if paul was certain of the crown
[44:19] that was waiting for him
[44:21] we also are sitting here with an
[44:23] assurance and the
[44:24] the bible says that he has given us the
[44:26] holy spirit
[44:27] as the token as only a portion of what
[44:31] we know
[44:31] awaits us on the other side so we can
[44:34] taste of the holy spirit and know that
[44:36] that which is waiting for me on the
[44:38] other side is real
[44:39] in other words we can see the reality of
[44:42] what's coming today
[44:43] the reality of what's await us on the
[44:45] other side we can taste of it today
[44:48] so god is not a god who uh who just
[44:51] waits and
[44:52] and he lets you just run your life and
[44:54] you do what you can
[44:55] and at the end i'll wait and i'll see
[44:58] exactly how you run your race and if you
[45:00] deserve anything
[45:01] and so but random speaks about pressing
[45:04] on towards
[45:05] and he speaks this isn't a message i was
[45:07] not disobedient to the heavenly vision
[45:10] he says i was thinking uh i was thinking
[45:14] that in the natural that i was thinking
[45:17] the natural man
[45:18] went out in the unseen now speaking
[45:21] about the natural man went out in the
[45:22] unseen with his
[45:23] eyes and pulled an atom down
[45:27] out of the sky and he split the atom
[45:30] and the two destroy human a destroy
[45:32] human life
[45:33] and then he says and if the natural man
[45:36] that knows nothing about god
[45:39] and know nothing about god except that
[45:42] he may be converted
[45:43] then he then his souls becomes alive
[45:46] with the supernatural
[45:47] if he could do that in the natural realm
[45:51] he says um what other men
[45:54] of god be doing it says my
[45:58] my friends it says he says my friend the
[46:00] church is
[46:01] is is a far off a far far behind
[46:05] let's pray that god may move uh
[46:08] will move us we'll move his church up
[46:11] the natural man
[46:12] with with this natural resources is
[46:14] getting greater results
[46:16] than the people that are called that are
[46:18] calling themselves christians
[46:21] now he's talking about the natural and i
[46:24] and i i was
[46:24] even recalling how albert randy just
[46:27] types out
[46:28] the countdown about the natural things
[46:30] and we know bharavanam uses the natural
[46:32] type to the spiritual
[46:34] here is a natural man with a natural
[46:36] intelligence
[46:37] he's able to go and pull from the unseen
[46:41] is able to pull down an adamant and know
[46:43] that if i take this and i split it
[46:45] and it causes so many human life to be
[46:48] lost
[46:48] and what i'm saying is able to achieve
[46:51] more
[46:51] than even a man who calls himself a
[46:53] christian so now he says
[46:55] let's press into the unseen the
[46:58] blessings are yours
[46:59] and that's that's and that's for you so
[47:02] he's basically telling us
[47:03] if we want to be successful we have to
[47:05] press into the unseen
[47:08] the the things the elements which are
[47:11] made to make us successful
[47:13] they're not in the same if the the
[47:16] natural man pulls from the unseen
[47:18] i tell you a christian has a whole lot
[47:21] of resources in the unseen
[47:23] in fact is in a place where he's come to
[47:25] an understanding
[47:27] that the very natural world is created
[47:29] by the unseen
[47:30] and everything about us comes from the
[47:32] unseen
[47:33] the scene will not give you anything the
[47:36] scene changes at all time
[47:38] the scene is subject to change at all
[47:40] moment but the unseen is where the
[47:42] reality lies
[47:43] the ending is what makes the scene and
[47:46] and often times we because because it
[47:49] takes us back to the place where
[47:51] where we become the people that judges
[47:54] everything about what we see we can hear
[47:56] and everything but what our pastor was
[47:58] saying last sunday there is a thirst for
[48:00] something else
[48:02] and and and and man without the holy
[48:05] spirit
[48:06] begins to take that thirst and and he
[48:08] tries this in the natural tries alcohol
[48:11] and
[48:11] he tries drugs and it tries this and he
[48:13] tries that
[48:14] why because there's something within
[48:16] himself
[48:17] that's calling for something that's in
[48:19] the unseen
[48:21] man needs deliverance you can't get
[48:24] deliverance from the world
[48:25] you need salvation you can't get
[48:27] salvation from the world
[48:29] you need healing the world doesn't have
[48:31] the healing to offer
[48:32] we need the supernatural the world
[48:34] that's enough for the supernatural
[48:36] it takes a man to go past the scene and
[48:39] drop into the unseen
[48:41] and pull from god something that cannot
[48:44] be seen with the
[48:45] eyes and then when it's manifested then
[48:47] people will know
[48:48] that there's a god who's able to heal
[48:50] there's a god who is able to offer
[48:52] salvation
[48:54] so we have to pull it from the ancient
[48:56] it says it says
[48:57] the hour is here people the time is here
[49:01] is here it says i say this and you
[49:04] and you can bring me a fanatic if you
[49:06] wish to i believe that this
[49:09] indicates the second coming of jesus
[49:11] christ
[49:12] amen for their signs and wonders
[49:15] and the things of it if you are not in
[49:17] the kingdom of god
[49:18] press into it it's telling if you are
[49:22] not
[49:22] you have to press into it and it says it
[49:25] continues on
[49:27] you have press into the kingdom of god
[49:29] press into it
[49:30] surely i would have some knowledge of
[49:33] what i'm speaking of
[49:35] or god will never honor my prayer to do
[49:38] what he
[49:39] what he does it says if you are outside
[49:41] of the kingdom
[49:42] seek christ as your refuge now it says
[49:46] while it's time
[49:47] and while you have the opportunity i
[49:50] tell you this
[49:50] the opportunity is closing up every day
[49:54] we are getting closer and closer
[49:56] every day time is going out and every
[49:59] day
[49:59] the the the the iniquity cup is filling
[50:02] up
[50:03] every day we can see and realize that
[50:05] the time is at hand
[50:06] every day we come to the place where we
[50:09] we actually
[50:10] if we look at it from the scripture at
[50:12] same point we've gone past the time
[50:15] as natural as can speak we've gone past
[50:17] the time that
[50:18] humanly we can think of if we can think
[50:21] what about him says in 1977 how he shot
[50:24] darkness and yeah we are today how dark
[50:27] can it be
[50:28] and how just a man has gone insane and
[50:31] all those things happening
[50:33] it shows that the time is at the very
[50:35] end because the prophet tells us that
[50:37] the the that light light itself
[50:41] it says it takes when the darkness said
[50:43] it is greatest
[50:44] it means that light is about to break up
[50:47] because when light shows up when it
[50:49] begins to come it compresses all the
[50:52] darkness together
[50:53] and the darkest hour is the time before
[50:56] light can show up
[51:01] so he says on it says it was it says i
[51:04] was asked one time by paul and silas
[51:06] it says in the philippian jailers this
[51:08] isn't a message investment
[51:10] it says what can we do to have eternal
[51:12] life
[51:13] he said believe on the lord jesus and
[51:15] down in the house
[51:17] dao if you truly not make believers
[51:20] but believers jesus said signs
[51:24] it says these signs in mark 16 shall
[51:26] follow
[51:29] not maybe but shall follow those who
[51:32] those that believe
[51:33] that if you got faith enough for your
[51:35] own salvation
[51:37] you can also claim your family by faith
[51:41] if you got if you got that kind of faith
[51:44] your faith can help your family doubt
[51:46] and thy house
[51:48] and then it continues on it says and
[51:50] noah it gives the example it says
[51:52] and noah seeing that the father a good
[51:55] man
[51:56] was pouring away his sons and daughters
[51:58] in laws
[51:59] and so forth come pouring away with him
[52:02] bearing the reproach of the word he says
[52:06] you always have to do that the kingdom
[52:08] of god
[52:09] doesn't come without a trial man presses
[52:13] into that kingdom and that's why i want
[52:16] to go with tonight
[52:17] man presses into that kingdom paul is
[52:20] saying i pressed towards the mark of the
[52:22] high calling
[52:23] what is in our mind in other words when
[52:26] when we
[52:27] we have to come to a place where uh uh
[52:30] christianity managed to turn
[52:31] christianity
[52:32] into a book of law a book of
[52:34] understanding
[52:36] into the rules of what you can follow or
[52:38] not follow
[52:39] some have taken it and changed it into a
[52:41] complete disgrace
[52:42] where i'll do nothing and god will just
[52:44] plug me out of this earth
[52:46] and make me a christian when he wants to
[52:48] and i'll go to heaven because he wants
[52:49] to
[52:50] god wants to but there has to be a
[52:53] pressing
[52:54] there has to be a burning desire there
[52:56] has to be something within your heart
[52:59] there has to be a thirst to respond to
[53:02] the call of god
[53:03] there has to be a thirst in other words
[53:05] god doesn't
[53:06] uh your predestination
[53:10] is by god himself none of us here can
[53:13] sit here
[53:14] and point who's predestinated and who's
[53:16] not we don't see it
[53:17] we don't have that ability it's not
[53:19] given to us but what we can
[53:21] save from the kingdom of god that he has
[53:23] given us is men
[53:24] and women that have hearts burning
[53:26] desire to see the manifestation of the
[53:29] supernatural
[53:30] they want to live by the supernatural
[53:32] they want to walk by the supernatural
[53:34] they want to see the promises of god
[53:36] pulled down
[53:38] manifested in their midst they want when
[53:40] they sickness they want to see healing
[53:42] come unfold
[53:43] when the person is lost they want to see
[53:45] the salvation of god
[53:47] those are the elected of god because by
[53:50] the fruits you can know them
[53:55] where people have turned it into just
[53:57] well you know god will do everything
[54:00] and all you have in other words it's
[54:02] it's a painful
[54:03] desire that you feel like if i don't get
[54:06] this i'll die
[54:11] it's not a one-sided effect god works on
[54:14] both hands
[54:15] he's here with his predestination but on
[54:18] the other hand
[54:18] there's a burning desire how can i see
[54:21] this god
[54:22] i want to touch him with my head i want
[54:25] to see him with my face
[54:26] i want to see the manifestation of his
[54:28] kingdom i can't live without it
[54:31] i hate this world i hate what i see in
[54:33] the mirror
[54:34] i want to see him manifest it
[54:39] it cannot be god calling and you're just
[54:41] going about your business and
[54:43] you know god will call when he calls
[54:45] that means you haven't heard the calling
[54:47] when you hear the calling you can't help
[54:50] it
[54:50] everything else the scripture says that
[54:52] the kingdom of god
[54:54] is like a man who finds a precious poll
[54:56] he finds it in a field
[54:58] what does he do he sells everything
[55:02] now i'll say this god sold everything to
[55:05] come and get that pearl
[55:06] and you the owner of the field you sell
[55:09] everything so you can keep the pearl
[55:11] because you know that's the most
[55:12] important thing
[55:17] so he says it says here it says
[55:20] kingdom uh noah the kingdom of god
[55:23] doesn't come with
[55:24] without trials it says man presses into
[55:28] it
[55:29] into the kingdom of god not observation
[55:32] now but it paid for it
[55:36] is saving is saving he says in saving
[55:39] his life
[55:40] we could stay out here and we could stay
[55:43] hours or noah
[55:44] in that so he speaks a year with with no
[55:47] observation
[55:49] it doesn't come with every man can
[55:52] see it it doesn't come in a place where
[55:55] everybody just notices oh i see the
[55:58] kingdom of god
[55:59] no it's within you it's it's that thirst
[56:03] is the kingdom of god calling that verse
[56:05] is the manifestation of the kingdom
[56:08] it's the kingdom of god coming into you
[56:11] and activating itself in order for the
[56:14] work of god to begin it's the kingdom of
[56:16] god
[56:17] coming from inside and pushing all the
[56:20] way outside
[56:21] in order for it to be manifested it's
[56:23] the kingdom
[56:24] god calling and bringing you into this
[56:26] presence
[56:27] to cause you so you can follow his laws
[56:30] and what he has
[56:30] established in the message perseverance
[56:34] it says
[56:36] brother and sister i don't know i don't
[56:38] know when but i'll make
[56:40] it says i'll make my trip to chicago one
[56:43] day
[56:44] it says this may be this may be it but
[56:47] i'm telling you it says in the name of
[56:48] the lord jesus
[56:50] in the name of the lord jesus the gospel
[56:52] is true this is the last day
[56:54] we are living in the shadow of his
[56:56] coming whatever you do
[56:58] press into the kingdom
[57:02] whatever you do press to enter the
[57:04] kingdom and the question i have for us
[57:06] today is
[57:07] what are we pressing after
[57:10] what is it that we are pressing after
[57:13] what is it that that thirst that painful
[57:16] desire
[57:16] what is it causing us to do now we
[57:19] realize that
[57:20] you know the scripture speaks about uh
[57:23] you know
[57:23] uh uh quench not the holy spirit or the
[57:26] the thirst there's a touch within a man
[57:29] that's supposed to be quenched by god
[57:30] himself and by the holy spirit
[57:32] and and as our even as our pastor said
[57:35] last time
[57:36] we what we do is we take the thirst and
[57:39] we begin to feel it we feel like
[57:41] well maybe if i just uh go i'd go do my
[57:44] job and i go do this and
[57:46] even i would even go as far as saying
[57:48] maybe if i just come to church and
[57:50] listen to the word of god
[57:51] then the taste will be filled no
[57:54] the thirst is more than just coming to
[57:56] church the thirst is more than just
[57:59] doing the things that you do every day
[58:01] the first is the fulfillment of god's
[58:04] word within your life
[58:05] the thirst is what causes you to move
[58:08] from where you are
[58:09] and move into the position that god has
[58:11] placed for you
[58:12] the thirst is the very thing that starts
[58:14] everything
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] without the thirst then we are just
[58:20] robots
[58:22] we're just a bunch of people trying to
[58:24] fulfill whatever we have in our
[58:25] intellect
[58:26] if if we don't desire it if we want
[58:29] painfully desire to see it what good is
[58:32] it for
[58:34] if all we can do is just follow after
[58:36] the letter we
[58:37] we we're not different from the uh uh
[58:39] the scripture speaks about
[58:40] uh uh in the uh the pharisees and
[58:43] the levite and those that worked in the
[58:45] temple because all they did is follow
[58:48] after what their father did all they did
[58:51] is they went into the temple
[58:53] from a young age educated to know the
[58:55] scroll and know everything and repeat it
[58:57] and repeat it
[58:58] now jesus came and looked at them and
[59:00] told them that you are of your father
[59:02] the devil
[59:05] because all that was it was just man
[59:08] effort
[59:08] it was just the flesh it was trying to
[59:11] fulfill
[59:12] a supernatural calling by a natural
[59:14] person
[59:17] there was no thirst and they looked at
[59:19] them and called them you are your father
[59:20] the devil
[59:21] but yeah with these disciples they
[59:23] looked unclean and
[59:24] they ate without washing their hands and
[59:27] they did all kinds of things that people
[59:28] could call them unbelievers
[59:30] but yet within those people there was a
[59:32] trust
[59:34] there was something that desired to see
[59:36] god there was something that wanted to
[59:38] see the manifestation
[59:40] of the holy spirit in the midst
[59:44] so so we realized
[59:47] yes paul speaking here i pressed towards
[59:50] the market
[59:53] paul he says it was his mind
[59:57] it he had this goal within his mind
[1:00:00] is his level of success if i could say
[1:00:04] his his level of uh what his contentment
[1:00:08] uh his success it was measured
[1:00:12] based on how close he was to his desire
[1:00:15] uh he is his happiness his ev everything
[1:00:18] about him
[1:00:19] was always measure based upon the mark
[1:00:22] that he had in front of him
[1:00:23] and and we know but talks about the mark
[1:00:26] it says
[1:00:26] that you know when you put it before it
[1:00:29] says uh
[1:00:30] it thoughts about shooting it says that
[1:00:32] that if the error starts here when the
[1:00:34] mark is off and
[1:00:36] and and and when something you're trying
[1:00:38] to aim for when it's off
[1:00:40] it says it starts right off here but
[1:00:42] when you go far off it gets further and
[1:00:44] further
[1:00:44] in other words it doesn't manifest the
[1:00:46] things which are taught it would
[1:00:48] manifest
[1:00:51] we can look at this world we can look at
[1:00:53] the church world and everything
[1:00:55] and realize that they are not
[1:00:56] manifesting the things which the bible
[1:00:59] says that would manifest
[1:01:01] we can look at the condition and realize
[1:01:03] they are not coming into the fullness
[1:01:06] of what the scriptures promise the
[1:01:07] fullness at the end time
[1:01:10] so here jesus speaks and he continued
[1:01:13] that paul speaks in
[1:01:14] and and i was just thinking about jesus
[1:01:20] i i just thought about he said that it
[1:01:24] was about his father's business
[1:01:27] and and no doubt we realized
[1:01:32] we we we can interpret that he he always
[1:01:35] followed what what was about his
[1:01:38] father's interest
[1:01:39] but we also have to realize that jesus
[1:01:41] knew that he was part of the father
[1:01:45] jesus went after the things which
[1:01:48] benefited the kingdom that he was part
[1:01:50] of
[1:01:51] the things which prosper the kingdom
[1:01:53] from which it came from
[1:01:55] the things which prosper the things
[1:01:59] which prosper
[1:02:00] in the kingdom which it came from he
[1:02:02] told
[1:02:03] them that this kingdom he says i'm not
[1:02:05] of this kingdom it says
[1:02:07] and if this was my kingdom it says my my
[1:02:10] soldier my
[1:02:11] my disciples will come and fight for me
[1:02:13] it says the angel will come and fight
[1:02:15] for me
[1:02:16] but he knew that this was not his
[1:02:17] kingdom so he worked in order to prosper
[1:02:21] the kingdom which he was part of that
[1:02:24] which he was sent to achieve
[1:02:25] and those things which was that was the
[1:02:27] desire of his heart
[1:02:28] when he says the word of god he says
[1:02:30] even as his disciple came to the well it
[1:02:32] says
[1:02:33] oh we brought fruit it says oh i already
[1:02:35] ate he says what is your way the word of
[1:02:37] god was his food
[1:02:40] when he see the word of god come to pass
[1:02:43] it satisfied his soul
[1:02:45] it brought heaviness within him
[1:02:49] he was happy to see those things that
[1:02:51] was his heart desire
[1:02:53] that was the thirst that was in him
[1:02:59] it says i was
[1:03:03] reading about how he went to
[1:03:06] be baptized by john and the scripture
[1:03:09] says that he came
[1:03:11] to the river jordanian and then
[1:03:14] and then john in the process began to
[1:03:17] realize
[1:03:19] oh that i'm the one who has need to be
[1:03:21] baptized
[1:03:22] that i'm the one who has need to be
[1:03:24] baptized
[1:03:26] but jesus looked at him and says that i
[1:03:28] want you to suffer
[1:03:30] that we may fulfill our righteousness in
[1:03:33] other words he was about his father's
[1:03:35] kingdom
[1:03:35] he wanted to see the scripture fulfilled
[1:03:38] and the things which were promised about
[1:03:40] him
[1:03:40] come to pass to the ladder he wanted to
[1:03:43] see what which was promising that time
[1:03:46] come to pass
[1:03:46] to the letter
[1:03:50] but random says in the message the
[1:03:52] fourth seal
[1:03:54] it says do you know i doubt
[1:03:57] it says i say 19 of the
[1:04:01] 19 of the people on earth
[1:04:05] ever know jesus was here when he was
[1:04:07] here
[1:04:09] it says i know when elijah prophesy i
[1:04:12] doubt where
[1:04:13] there was hardly anybody know he was
[1:04:17] it says they know there was a crack up
[1:04:21] they know they know there was a crack up
[1:04:24] there
[1:04:25] some old fanatic but and
[1:04:28] but they hated him sure
[1:04:31] he was it was what they they would call
[1:04:34] it oddball
[1:04:35] and i think anybody
[1:04:38] and i think any any born again christian
[1:04:41] is kind of an oddball
[1:04:43] it says to the world because you've been
[1:04:47] changed you've been you are from
[1:04:50] above you are from another world your
[1:04:53] spirit
[1:04:54] your spirit from across the chasm and
[1:04:57] and these things which is such a mess up
[1:05:00] thing
[1:05:01] it said there are no different there's
[1:05:03] something wrong
[1:05:04] they are still too earthbound you ought
[1:05:07] to be
[1:05:08] heavenly minded heaven lives
[1:05:11] by the word amen
[1:05:14] and and i think and i i just want to say
[1:05:17] this
[1:05:18] i feel like sometimes we get if i were
[1:05:21] say
[1:05:22] to earthly bound and to uh earthly
[1:05:25] minded by
[1:05:26] by our thinking and by our approach to
[1:05:28] things and
[1:05:29] uh we we let the things of the world
[1:05:32] affect us
[1:05:32] easily and and and you know you you
[1:05:36] think we we pick up calls that are not
[1:05:38] supposed to be
[1:05:39] ours we get into things that are not to
[1:05:42] be ours
[1:05:43] we we think in the way of the natural
[1:05:46] man
[1:05:46] but we forget that we are born from
[1:05:48] another kingdom
[1:05:50] we are born in the kingdom of god and we
[1:05:53] are
[1:05:53] equipped by the supernatural we are
[1:05:56] equipped by the unseen of that kingdom
[1:05:59] for us to manifest it in this world and
[1:06:02] people
[1:06:02] hear things and they pick up a cause and
[1:06:05] they want to see something happen
[1:06:07] i'll tell you this i believe the best
[1:06:09] activist there is in this world is a
[1:06:11] christian
[1:06:12] because if you are an activist on this
[1:06:14] world all you're just trying to do is
[1:06:16] change somebody's mind from one mind to
[1:06:18] another mind
[1:06:19] they will just convert you from this
[1:06:20] group to another group and
[1:06:22] you'll follow after this group after
[1:06:24] just go but a christian
[1:06:26] is the only true activist because he
[1:06:28] takes you from this kingdom
[1:06:30] and he takes you into the kingdom of god
[1:06:32] is the only one who can give you
[1:06:35] access to something that this world
[1:06:37] cannot offer to you
[1:06:38] and bring a real change into your life
[1:06:41] and give you eternal life
[1:06:46] that's what we need to press for that we
[1:06:49] can exchange our natural mind
[1:06:51] it won't happen it won't help us in
[1:06:53] anything
[1:06:54] but oh if we can change heavenly minds
[1:06:57] if we can share the scripture says faith
[1:06:59] comes by hearing
[1:07:01] by the hearing of the word of god and
[1:07:03] then we put our licks of fire together
[1:07:05] and we get energized and then the
[1:07:08] scripture says where two or three i
[1:07:09] gather under my name i'll come in the
[1:07:11] midst
[1:07:11] and then the holy spirit dropped that's
[1:07:13] where the supernatural happened
[1:07:17] oftentimes we just come and you know
[1:07:20] even when songs are going forth and our
[1:07:23] minds we're still
[1:07:24] you know we still think about everything
[1:07:26] that we didn't finish at work
[1:07:28] all the dishes that await us at home and
[1:07:31] the things at which we have to go pick
[1:07:33] up what we left off and i know this is a
[1:07:35] wednesday service
[1:07:36] but we get carried into those things
[1:07:38] away and i want to say this we need to
[1:07:40] learn to break up out of those things
[1:07:44] we need to realize that we are of
[1:07:46] another kingdom
[1:07:47] one day i watch the last dish and one
[1:07:50] day i'll clock out for the last time
[1:07:52] one day oh oh they'll be looking for me
[1:07:54] and i'll be gone
[1:07:57] they'll pick up the phone and call hey
[1:07:59] he's not answering his phone
[1:08:00] where is he i go to my kingdom i go from
[1:08:04] where i came from
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:08] brothers and sisters this cannot be the
[1:08:10] end of us
[1:08:11] this cannot be what we are looking for
[1:08:14] this cannot be what our mind is about
[1:08:16] there has to be something that we can
[1:08:19] thirst for
[1:08:20] that's more than what we see
[1:08:25] paul said that we of all people are the
[1:08:27] most miserable
[1:08:29] oh but there's a thirst no wonder the
[1:08:31] prophet said
[1:08:32] i hunger and dress for those things said
[1:08:35] i want to see the kingdom of god
[1:08:38] come into plain view it doesn't come
[1:08:40] with observation
[1:08:42] but how does it come a thirst within
[1:08:44] your heart
[1:08:50] time time-tested memorial he speaks
[1:08:52] about a vision he says
[1:08:54] i had a he speaks about this man who
[1:08:56] built the bridge he said he had a vision
[1:08:59] before a man can have a reputation he
[1:09:01] has to have a vision
[1:09:03] of what he's doing he has to have a goal
[1:09:05] a mark of what he's pressing for
[1:09:08] oh bless the lord that's the reason we
[1:09:11] are
[1:09:11] we are there is a heavenly there is a
[1:09:13] heaven to go to
[1:09:15] i love that he says that's the reason
[1:09:17] why there's a heaven to go to
[1:09:19] there's a reason we can it says that's
[1:09:21] the reason
[1:09:22] we can have a reputation as a christian
[1:09:25] in other words the heavens to go to
[1:09:28] justify the reputation that we have here
[1:09:30] below
[1:09:31] it says we know that the material is
[1:09:34] here
[1:09:35] in the building that's right the blood
[1:09:38] of jesus
[1:09:38] is in the building that's right
[1:09:42] his stained blood has washed away all
[1:09:44] our sins
[1:09:45] he took he took me from the alleys of
[1:09:49] hell and made me his servant then i
[1:09:52] believe in
[1:09:52] him so i pray from death to life
[1:09:56] i pass from death to life and every
[1:09:59] believer has
[1:10:00] had did that because they had to go
[1:10:03] they have they've got the confidence
[1:10:05] that they believe
[1:10:06] in this great builder this is a great
[1:10:09] architect
[1:10:11] it's the great builder and i want to say
[1:10:13] this we have to have a desire that
[1:10:15] thirst has to manifest itself
[1:10:18] that does cannot just be said well i
[1:10:20] have a thirst
[1:10:21] but you do nothing about it you die
[1:10:27] no no one becomes a doctor
[1:10:30] by accident you have to put in the work
[1:10:34] you have to go to school you have to
[1:10:36] take the classes you have to pass the
[1:10:37] exams
[1:10:38] you have to do all of those things no
[1:10:41] one can become a great engineer
[1:10:43] by accident oh i just stumble and i now
[1:10:46] you you may have a gift the talent the
[1:10:48] things that you love and everything
[1:10:50] but you got to go through the process
[1:10:52] you got to take some classes you got to
[1:10:53] go
[1:10:54] so you can be what certified so you can
[1:10:56] be given a seal something that shows
[1:10:58] that this person
[1:11:00] has shown that they have the desire to
[1:11:01] become this but yet
[1:11:03] the seal shows that the thirst that was
[1:11:05] in there is fulfilled
[1:11:09] oh i tell you when we were back there we
[1:11:12] read about the box card
[1:11:13] everything everything that you had need
[1:11:16] of
[1:11:16] when you received that seal god made
[1:11:19] sure that it was contained
[1:11:21] within that seed to take you from here
[1:11:23] into the heavenly places
[1:11:26] it's got to be a chance to see that if i
[1:11:28] need this today
[1:11:30] that means there's something in here
[1:11:32] that wants to see this come to pass
[1:11:34] and then when it comes to pass it takes
[1:11:36] you to another one it takes you to
[1:11:37] another one that's how god works
[1:11:46] but random talks about
[1:11:50] this young man and thought about the
[1:11:53] story of the young man
[1:11:55] who is riding a bicycle with this
[1:11:57] talented people
[1:12:00] it says that in the story there's no
[1:12:03] place where it talks about
[1:12:04] that he had some type of gift or ability
[1:12:08] better than the other people in fact
[1:12:10] that's not what's attributed to him
[1:12:14] and and and this is goes to show that
[1:12:17] it's not our talent our ability that god
[1:12:19] is looking for
[1:12:21] this young man was only focused to the
[1:12:23] mark that was put in front of them
[1:12:25] now in the on the road as they were
[1:12:27] writing you notice in the story that the
[1:12:30] others were getting distracted by the
[1:12:32] things which were calling them left and
[1:12:34] right
[1:12:35] by the noise and the things and or by
[1:12:37] trying to prove
[1:12:38] something that they were that they were
[1:12:40] a great writer that they knew more about
[1:12:42] more than the other people and all those
[1:12:44] things
[1:12:44] those are the things that caused the
[1:12:46] failure and
[1:12:48] and this one wouldn't seem to have been
[1:12:50] according to the story
[1:12:51] the less talented of all got to the
[1:12:54] finish line
[1:12:56] and i say this it's not who runs fast
[1:12:59] it's not who has the ability to produce
[1:13:01] something it's not who has the ability
[1:13:03] to show or to explain or to do this
[1:13:05] but it's here who makes it towards the
[1:13:08] head
[1:13:09] by keeping his eyes on the prize by
[1:13:11] making sure that you have the mark
[1:13:14] and what's her mouth it's perfection
[1:13:17] not the perfection that we can achieve
[1:13:18] on our own but the perfection
[1:13:20] by the perfect world that we have
[1:13:22] received by believing
[1:13:24] the perfect word we automatically
[1:13:27] becomes
[1:13:27] perfect
[1:13:31] you believe that by believing a perfect
[1:13:34] word
[1:13:34] you automatically becomes perfect why
[1:13:37] because
[1:13:38] the word will work in you and will work
[1:13:41] on you
[1:13:41] until it manifests the perfection that
[1:13:43] is calling for
[1:13:47] it's not him or honest it's not who
[1:13:50] does this it's god who shows mercy and
[1:13:52] if god
[1:13:53] shows the mercy i'm running with it
[1:13:58] oftentimes we say to him it's not him
[1:14:01] who run it and then we don't run we
[1:14:03] don't do anything
[1:14:04] no the mercy is given to you so that
[1:14:07] it's not by the talented one
[1:14:09] it's not by him who can do this or do
[1:14:11] that but it's him who stayed with what
[1:14:13] they've been
[1:14:14] given those are the ones that get to the
[1:14:16] finish line
[1:14:22] he says
[1:14:25] gracious heavenly father to thee we give
[1:14:29] praise of all thy goodness and our mercy
[1:14:32] it says and now quieten us down lord and
[1:14:36] that we might study the word of the
[1:14:38] living god
[1:14:40] as it comes to us through the vision and
[1:14:43] is confirmed by the holy spirit backed
[1:14:46] by the bible
[1:14:48] we pray that will give us understanding
[1:14:51] that we may know
[1:14:52] what to do in this last day that we see
[1:14:55] the evil powers
[1:14:57] settling around us now the battle the
[1:15:00] final battle
[1:15:00] is just about to be fought help us lord
[1:15:04] israel warriors strong let us keep the
[1:15:06] shield of faith
[1:15:08] with the word of god the sword and move
[1:15:10] forward
[1:15:11] in jesus name i say that's our prayer
[1:15:14] you know we're not called to be the
[1:15:16] mightiest but we're called to just stand
[1:15:19] we just call whatever we've been given
[1:15:21] that's what we stand with
[1:15:22] however measure of phrase we've been
[1:15:24] given that's what we stand for
[1:15:25] i was reading but when i'm talking about
[1:15:27] in the message
[1:15:33] in the message god has a provided way i
[1:15:36] believe
[1:15:37] he speaks about how uh this this this i
[1:15:40] believe it's the geese so this birds how
[1:15:42] they take a fly
[1:15:43] it says all these thoughts think about
[1:15:45] it the whole community of them
[1:15:47] all it starts the way it starts it just
[1:15:50] takes one
[1:15:52] of them to get the inspiration and it
[1:15:55] will begin to scream and to scream and
[1:15:57] to scream and pretty soon they begin to
[1:15:59] gather
[1:16:00] together together and they will gather
[1:16:02] until they take a flight
[1:16:04] and i say this my brother my sister we
[1:16:06] have to come to a place where
[1:16:08] when the word of god is reaching we get
[1:16:10] burning and
[1:16:11] and our desire to grow and we begin to
[1:16:14] gather together
[1:16:15] and to want to see the word and
[1:16:17] everything that's how we're going to go
[1:16:18] home it's not by getting colder it's by
[1:16:22] getting hotter
[1:16:23] [Applause]
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:27] you can't be backsliding and think i'm
[1:16:29] just gonna make it no
[1:16:30] you gotta get hotter you gotta let the
[1:16:33] word of god make you hard
[1:16:34] you got to let it strengthen you you got
[1:16:37] to let it burn within your heart
[1:16:39] the way you can't stand yourself anymore
[1:16:44] because that's that's what means that
[1:16:47] something is happening and it's taking
[1:16:49] us into the other direction
[1:16:52] but you see the challenge of it is but
[1:16:54] venom tells us that
[1:16:55] that that it's the trouble always comes
[1:16:59] before the promise shows up
[1:17:03] the thing about it is trouble is always
[1:17:05] at the door
[1:17:06] before the promise shows up you think
[1:17:08] about the children of israel
[1:17:10] when the time of the promise began to
[1:17:12] get near guess what happened
[1:17:15] somehow they came in pharaoh who didn't
[1:17:17] know who
[1:17:18] who joseph was is that a coincidence no
[1:17:22] it was just means that the time of the
[1:17:25] promise was near
[1:17:26] they began to work them hard and to work
[1:17:29] them hard
[1:17:30] now pharaoh was doing that thinking that
[1:17:32] he's doing it for the benefit of his own
[1:17:34] kingdom
[1:17:34] but he forget that he was fulfilling
[1:17:36] god's plan
[1:17:38] that why because there had to be a
[1:17:40] thirst
[1:17:41] a desire within them when they got tired
[1:17:44] of those breaks and
[1:17:46] they got tired of what they were doing
[1:17:48] and they wanted to see god manifested
[1:17:51] when they were in the upper room they
[1:17:53] began to cry out
[1:17:54] they wanted to see the promise come to
[1:17:56] pass my brother and my sister the
[1:17:58] rapture will come when we stop burning
[1:18:00] we want to see god and it's the power of
[1:18:03] god that will come and manifest the
[1:18:05] rapture in us
[1:18:17] oh i got a lot of trouble that's good it
[1:18:20] just means the promise is somewhere
[1:18:22] closer
[1:18:23] it just means it's the fire
[1:18:26] lighting you up so you can look for the
[1:18:28] promise something to save you out of
[1:18:30] your trouble
[1:18:31] it just means i need something to get me
[1:18:33] out of this situation that i'm in
[1:18:36] why because it's the time god has made
[1:18:38] it to where
[1:18:39] its situations begin to change
[1:18:43] the work situation began to change the
[1:18:45] living situation began to change
[1:18:48] there were days just settling there the
[1:18:50] scripture of barbara says that god made
[1:18:52] them to be farmers and all those things
[1:18:54] in fact they already had a place
[1:18:56] predestinated for them
[1:18:58] yet they are in the bondage yeah they
[1:19:00] are just making breaks and
[1:19:02] and all those things now it wasn't that
[1:19:05] bad when they were making breaks i
[1:19:06] thought well
[1:19:07] you know as long as they give a straw
[1:19:09] there's no issue you know we could still
[1:19:11] this is the man in the bondage
[1:19:16] and often time we we we just you know as
[1:19:19] long as
[1:19:20] oh as long as it's not too painful it's
[1:19:22] fine you know
[1:19:23] you know i'll just take it it's i'll
[1:19:26] take it it's okay
[1:19:27] and this happened and you know i'll take
[1:19:28] it i'll take it the question is when are
[1:19:31] you not going to be able to take it
[1:19:32] anymore
[1:19:35] when is that thirst gonna start where
[1:19:38] you say
[1:19:38] i think i've had enough i think i don't
[1:19:41] want any more of this
[1:19:42] why what create that it's the choice
[1:19:44] that god's for cindy
[1:19:46] you just get to a place i've had enough
[1:19:48] and i think too many
[1:19:50] of us have not gotten to a place where
[1:19:51] we've had enough we're so satisfied when
[1:19:54] they're satisfied with that
[1:19:55] we come back up we fall we're okay with
[1:19:58] it we do this and we go wrong here we go
[1:20:00] wrong
[1:20:01] watch it just come to a place where i
[1:20:02] say i've had enough
[1:20:04] and i want to see god come to pass
[1:20:07] [Applause]
[1:20:16] it says heavenly father
[1:20:19] we thank thee for gathering together
[1:20:25] we thank this for this gathering
[1:20:26] together of men
[1:20:30] that put in the office that you put in

[1:21:21] and protect us and they may be found
[1:21:23] faithful on the post of duty
[1:21:25] in jesus christ so now he's speaking
[1:21:28] is even showing the heart desire we we
[1:21:31] want to be found right
[1:21:33] and the only way we could be find right
[1:21:35] is to be
[1:21:36] in the pressing mode you know the
[1:21:40] christian life is not one that you can
[1:21:42] go and you know
[1:21:43] punch off the clock and say man i've
[1:21:45] been a christian for long i just need a
[1:21:46] break
[1:21:49] and i feel like that's what some people
[1:21:51] do they take a break they come in they
[1:21:52] take a break they go out they come to
[1:21:54] take a break and
[1:21:55] you just do that one day you'll take
[1:21:57] your break and the door will close
[1:22:01] we can't take a break we are made to be
[1:22:04] soldiers of the cross
[1:22:06] whether you get your teeth knocked out
[1:22:08] whether you get your legs broken you
[1:22:10] just stay in the bottle
[1:22:12] but branham says if you can fight him
[1:22:14] you gum him
[1:22:16] if you don't have truth whatever you do
[1:22:18] don't ever give up
[1:22:20] you are not being created to give up
[1:22:23] you are made to be an overcomer and
[1:22:25] overcome it's not strength
[1:22:27] it's this it's someone with a heart to
[1:22:30] never give up or thirst
[1:22:32] something that will eat you up and just
[1:22:34] never let you give up
[1:22:38] if the musician could come oftentimes we
[1:22:41] just walk around and
[1:22:43] you know we read about the promises of
[1:22:45] god that he pour out of his spirit in
[1:22:47] the last day
[1:22:48] we just rejoice thank god and everything
[1:22:50] i'll tell you i rejoice but i want to
[1:22:52] see that spirit
[1:22:53] i want to say it for myself i want a
[1:22:55] taste of it i want to taste of it myself
[1:22:58] i want a taste of it so i can go tell
[1:23:00] the others i can't go tell the others if
[1:23:02] i haven't tasted it myself
[1:23:05] i can't talk about healing if i haven't
[1:23:07] had it myself i can't talk about
[1:23:09] salvation if i don't know what he's
[1:23:10] talking about
[1:23:13] god is looking for witness he's looking
[1:23:16] for somebody
[1:23:17] to taste of this kingdom of hearts
[1:23:20] to know what it tastes like to know what
[1:23:22] it means like
[1:23:23] to know what he always about to taste of
[1:23:26] it so you can go to battle with
[1:23:28] it there's a bunch of people talking
[1:23:31] about the kingdom of god and they hadn't
[1:23:33] even taste of a piece of him
[1:23:36] but god is here he's calling he says
[1:23:39] come
[1:23:40] come unto me come and i will give you
[1:23:43] rest
[1:23:43] in other words i'll take your yoke and
[1:23:45] i'll give you rest
[1:23:47] i'll have your taste of my goodness of
[1:23:49] your taste of what i
[1:23:51] am i'll tell you i have a taste of my
[1:23:53] power
[1:23:54] why because when you go out there talk
[1:23:56] about my power you know exactly what
[1:23:58] you're talking about
[1:24:00] and the people that are pressing for it
[1:24:02] god will manifest themselves to them
[1:24:04] because the scripture says to them that
[1:24:07] are looking for his appearing
[1:24:09] only those who will come to
[1:24:12] he didn't come now think about it the
[1:24:14] fullest version we're not looking for
[1:24:15] him
[1:24:16] they heard the call but they said but
[1:24:19] the wise version
[1:24:21] when they heard the call they went to
[1:24:23] seek for all they began to prison
[1:24:25] they began to press to make sure they
[1:24:27] had the old they knew that was the
[1:24:29] requirement then when they showed up
[1:24:30] they were able to go in with them
[1:24:34] let's brace in my brother my sister
[1:24:36] let's not let the kingdom of this whole
[1:24:38] earth and overtake us and the things of
[1:24:41] this world overtake us in all things but
[1:24:43] let's praise for this kingdom
[1:24:45] the kingdom of god is for those that
[1:24:47] suffer violence
[1:24:48] those that want to see god manifesting
[1:24:52] a painful desire let's all stand
[1:25:04] let's respond our heads as our pastor

[1:27:30] strength
[1:27:39] brother billy brought the word of the
[1:27:42] lord tonight i
[1:27:43] i thought in my heart how often do we
[1:27:47] even consider
[1:27:49] the supernatural you can't look for
[1:27:52] something you don't consider
[1:27:55] you know how how many times do we think
[1:27:57] to
[1:27:58] bring the supernatural into our
[1:28:02] our situation or our our problem
[1:28:06] maybe you've got a child that's wayward
[1:28:10] and you know you have all the hope for
[1:28:14] them but
[1:28:15] sometimes you just got to sit back and
[1:28:17] say lord i need a miracle
[1:28:21] i'm not looking i'm looking for the
[1:28:22] supernatural
[1:28:24] i want the supernatural to come i want
[1:28:27] the supernatural
[1:28:28] to be there maybe you've got
[1:28:31] problems and you know you have an enemy
[1:28:35] fight sometimes you just got to go
[1:28:38] beyond the realm of your senses brother
[1:28:41] billy said you got to look into the
[1:28:43] unseen
[1:28:44] and say you know what i'm believing a
[1:28:46] miracle
[1:28:47] but he said something that was tonight
[1:28:49] you know he says we do it together
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:55] we do it as an army we do it as a body
[1:28:59] we do it believing together for the
[1:29:01] supernatural
[1:29:03] tonight and if we pray together and we
[1:29:05] believe together
[1:29:07] and we agree on any one thing it's what
[1:29:09] comes to pass
[1:29:11] and maybe you're here tonight and you
[1:29:13] need
[1:29:14] something from god maybe you need a
[1:29:20] a deliverance or a healing
[1:29:23] or a direction in your life you just
[1:29:26] need
[1:29:27] something from the lord tonight
[1:29:31] something supernatural you don't maybe
[1:29:34] not even know what it is
[1:29:36] but you know there's a deep calling to a
[1:29:38] d
[1:29:39] and so many times we have a deep calling
[1:29:42] to deep we go
[1:29:43] looking for the answer but you can't
[1:29:46] find it in a carnal realm
[1:29:48] because it's a spiritual thirst it's got
[1:29:50] to come from someplace
[1:29:52] else and and if you're there this
[1:29:55] evening i
[1:29:56] or you need prayer tonight maybe you're
[1:29:59] healing maybe you're out of work
[1:30:01] maybe that they put you on furlough no
[1:30:04] matter what it is the
[1:30:06] problem is that's what's wonderful about
[1:30:08] the supernatural
[1:30:10] the supernatural doesn't find its
[1:30:12] answers in the natural
[1:30:16] the supernatural finds its answers than
[1:30:18] the unseen
[1:30:20] amen so if you have a need tonight
[1:30:24] and as they play just pick a song billy
[1:30:27] you think we should listen to or
[1:30:29] sing and you in your heart
[1:30:32] want to just take a moment now lift your
[1:30:35] hand to him
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] and say lord i i need something
[1:30:41] supernatural
[1:30:44] i'm not worthy
[1:30:48] i don't even know what it is
[1:30:51] because it comes from a realm that
[1:30:55] is beyond my comprehension
[1:30:58] and i'm asking you tonight too
[1:31:02] meet my need whether it be healing
[1:31:08] whether it be deliverance from a habit
[1:31:12] whether it be the holy spirit whatever
[1:31:15] it might be

[1:31:38] clouds i'm looking into heavenly
[1:31:42] lord and i'm placing my need at your
[1:31:45] throne tonight
