[42:42] the amen let's pray father that's
[42:49] certainly what our eyes are focused
[42:54] on like the boy on the B sickle he said
[42:58] I just look all the way to the
[43:01] end it's my focus I just keep my eye on
[43:04] that and I just keep pedling towards it
[43:08] father we just ask that tonight that we
[43:11] can just move closer to that
[43:14] place May the joy of our Salvation be
[43:17] our portion tonight and may we just have
[43:20] a time of Fellowship this evening for a
[43:22] few moments in the precious and
[43:25] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus
[43:27] we ask these things amen and amen God
[43:32] bless you if you have your Bibles I
[43:33] certainly enjoyed that uh song tonight
[43:36] that was really great to hear
[43:39] that
[43:49] amen okay let's turn to a a really
[43:53] familiar scripture and and uh found in
[43:58] the gospel of St John the third the thir
[44:02] chapter and the 16th verse and we'd like
[44:08] to read that this evening and then just
[44:11] have a a little time of
[44:14] U just fellowship and and read some
[44:18] scriptures together and then uh not have
[44:21] too long of the
[44:22] evening um so it says in St John the
[44:26] Third chapter in the 16th verse so God
[44:30] so loved the world that he gave his only
[44:36] begotten
[44:38] son that whosoever believeth in him
[44:42] should not perish but have
[44:47] everlasting life father we ask you to
[44:50] bless your service this evening in your
[44:53] precious name we pray amen amen God
[44:56] bless BL you may be seated and and while
[44:59] you're seated uh let's turn over to the
[45:03] book of Hebrews because we just want to
[45:06] read together tonight the first two
[45:10] chapters of the book of Hebrews together
[45:14] and and if if I was to have a title um I
[45:20] found it was better for me to title my
[45:22] sermons than to let my sons title my
[45:26] sermons
[45:27] uh because uh uh uh you
[45:33] know they they say Dad I titled your
[45:37] sermon the Everlasting power of the
[45:39] third pole under the opening of the
[45:42] seventh seal with the Fulfillment of the
[45:46] Capstone and uh so I thought maybe a
[45:49] little simpler titles because I'm a kind
[45:52] of a simple preacher but I'd like to
[45:55] title this the first Christmas
[45:59] gift because really that was the first
[46:02] Christmas gift the Lord you giving the
[46:05] Lord his only begotten son to us was the
[46:09] first Christmas gift and I thought about
[46:14] this gift and I I thought a a beautiful
[46:20] way to describe this gift is the way
[46:25] that Paul Paul describes it in this
[46:28] first two chapters of Hebrews as we read
[46:32] it now this is a a gift of God God so
[46:38] loved the world and it was the uh it was
[46:42] the work of his hands it was uh his
[46:45] thoughts
[46:46] expressed as as we uh read in the uh uh
[46:54] uh the uh
[46:57] scriptures that how that God had this
[47:00] thought in his mind and in the beginning
[47:03] was God and God created the heavens and
[47:06] earth he he didn't create it by some
[47:10] other substance he created it of himself
[47:15] so basically he created it with what
[47:18] that he was so it would be like if I
[47:21] reached into me and pulled this part of
[47:24] me out and this part of me out and that
[47:27] part of me out and I took the very
[47:29] substance that I was and made something
[47:33] out of it it would have to be it would
[47:36] have to be special to me because it was
[47:39] me and the heavens and earth was him it
[47:44] was him
[47:46] manifested it was him expressed and so
[47:49] he expressed himself and he loved the
[47:52] world and and we we went through the
[47:55] teaching of this many times but we know
[47:59] that Adam was in this great world that
[48:02] God created for his son so that God
[48:05] would have someone to fellowship with
[48:07] but yet there was a part of God that
[48:10] Adam never
[48:11] knew and uh he didn't know that God was
[48:15] a Healer because nothing needed healing
[48:18] he didn't know that God was a savior
[48:21] because nothing needed
[48:23] saving uh and
[48:25] so those he was a deliverer and Adam
[48:28] didn't know this all he could see was
[48:30] the wonderful glory of God so God
[48:33] allowed a plan to come into effect
[48:37] and that man would fall but man wouldn't
[48:41] really fall per se because he would
[48:45] secure that man by putting his name on
[48:49] The Gift of of the book of life and that
[48:53] gift of man was there now so that was
[48:56] the condition man was in but man was now
[49:00] born in sin shaped in iniquity and came
[49:05] into the world speaking
[49:07] lies and because of the Fall man now had
[49:12] a
[49:12] nature at that that he had no control
[49:17] over so he was driven and and in captive
[49:23] to uh the senses of his flesh
[49:27] and to his emotions you know it's
[49:30] amazing isn't it how easy you can get
[49:33] your feelings
[49:35] hurt you don't even see
[49:39] them you know what I mean but yet they
[49:41] can get hurt so bad and and and you can
[49:46] go someplace and and and you can just
[49:50] sense that you're not welcome or sense
[49:54] that something's wrong and and maybe you
[49:57] can't even put your handle on it or your
[49:59] finger on it so to speak or you don't
[50:01] know what it is but you just feel all
[50:04] upset and nervous and there's just
[50:07] things that go on and these were the
[50:09] things that man was subject to man was
[50:12] subject to
[50:14] death be and that's what happened
[50:17] because the day that you eat thereof is
[50:20] the day that you die and so that was the
[50:24] condition that man was in
[50:27] and and man had nothing to look forward
[50:29] to but a
[50:31] grave and and and uh they they weren't
[50:36] sure of of what would take place next
[50:40] they had different ideas and different
[50:43] things but now God was going to give a
[50:47] gift and that's what we celebrate
[50:50] Christmas is about Christmas is about
[50:52] the birth of Christ uh I know the
[50:55] devil's doing all that he he can to make
[50:58] it a man in a little red suit and uh uh
[51:01] you know I I saw the other day that a
[51:04] hilicopter had gone to a school and
[51:07] dropped in there in the school and I'm
[51:09] sure that they brought Santa Claus in
[51:12] there you know but I thought how much
[51:14] better would it be if maybe we went over
[51:17] there and and had some wise men come in
[51:20] and and had uh maybe uh Joseph and Mary
[51:25] come into the school and and say well
[51:27] here it is this is the gift this is the
[51:31] first gift this is the gift that started
[51:34] what you've got now was because of this
[51:37] gift you're getting your Tonka truck
[51:39] because God gave this gift you're
[51:42] getting you know you've got your tinsel
[51:44] on your tree because God gave this gift
[51:47] everything that you're doing everything
[51:50] you're celebrating everything that that
[51:53] you're receiving you're receiving
[51:55] because God gave this first gift this
[51:59] was the first gift this was the the the
[52:02] first Christmas gift that God gave so
[52:05] let's just read these two chapters just
[52:08] for the next few moments and and let's
[52:10] just take a moment and look at this gift
[52:14] that God
[52:16] gave and I think the as we go on it'll
[52:20] come clearer and clearer when we finally
[52:22] reach our our last conclusion of really
[52:26] how how powerful this gift was and and
[52:30] it's just not an ordinary gift and
[52:33] that's what's that's what's so fantastic
[52:37] about it it it's it's it's a gift that
[52:41] Paul describes here that is so
[52:45] encompassing and so large and so
[52:48] wonderful that he wants to start out
[52:51] talking about the Majesty of this gift
[52:56] now remember this is God's gift to
[52:59] you it it's wonderful you know to uh uh
[53:05] uh have a gift you know uh several years
[53:08] ago uh we were in need of a car so I I
[53:13] knew we had to buy a car so I bought
[53:15] lesie a car for her
[53:17] birthday and uh which was good and you
[53:21] know I put the bow on it and parked in
[53:23] her driveway and and did all that and so
[53:26] we had had the car for a couple years
[53:29] and one day I said I thought you know I
[53:31] I'm going to buy uh I'm going to buy her
[53:35] remote start for her car so when it's
[53:39] cold she can just press some buttons and
[53:42] the engal start up and have remote start
[53:46] so I went to one of the boys and I said
[53:48] hey I'd like to get Mom remote start for
[53:52] her car for Christmas and they said it's
[53:55] already got it
[54:00] two years we had the
[54:03] car and so they went up and they pressed
[54:06] the lock button and then the button on
[54:09] top and the car started well we forgot
[54:12] that simple procedure and uh sister Li
[54:15] Parks helped us remind us the other day
[54:17] and we now we know how to start our our
[54:21] car up but we had it all the time it was
[54:26] part of the gift you understand but we
[54:30] didn't know all that encompassed in the
[54:33] gift all that is in the gift and and and
[54:38] so uh if we just take a few moments and
[54:41] just read this we begin to grasp and
[54:45] understand this gift and so it says now
[54:48] God who had sundried times and in
[54:52] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[54:56] the fathers by the prophets so God used
[55:00] to speak to the People by
[55:03] prophets and and that was the way that
[55:07] God spoke but Paul's now talking about
[55:10] this great gift he says but hath in
[55:14] these last days spoken unto us by his
[55:19] son so this is a gift that
[55:24] speaks this is a gift that will talk to
[55:27] you and communicate with you and so it's
[55:31] a wonderful gift who
[55:34] have a appointed heir of All Things by
[55:38] whom also he made the world so we we
[55:42] want Paul wants to point out here that
[55:45] this the Majesty of this gift he's
[55:49] speaking to us not by just a prophet not
[55:52] by just some other man not by something
[55:56] that's educated but God gave us a gift
[56:00] to speak to us that was heir of all
[56:03] things and was the
[56:06] creator of all things he made all things
[56:10] by whom also made the worlds so you're
[56:15] getting a gift that made the worlds
[56:18] somebody that made the world is being
[56:22] given to you as a gift this is no shabby
[56:29] gift you understand this ain't no little
[56:32] gift you know what I mean you know like
[56:36] the ones that you got four or five of
[56:38] already uh you know let me say it like
[56:42] this it ain't
[56:47] socks you know what I mean it's this is
[56:50] something
[56:51] real this is something that is is is is
[56:55] all all out it it's full it's maxed out
[57:00] in fact the first gift was the best gift
[57:04] that was ever given amen there would
[57:06] never be another gift like it never a
[57:09] gift that has all that it contains in it
[57:12] that this was not some gift that he's
[57:16] given you now I want you put this in
[57:18] your heart this is your
[57:23] gift it's God's gift to you you he so
[57:27] loved you that he gave you the one that
[57:32] was air to all things and made the world
[57:37] now that's who you'd like to know huh
[57:39] everybody says oh I'd like to know a
[57:41] rich guy you know somebody who's rich he
[57:43] air to all the world so this is the gift
[57:47] that he's talking about and who being in
[57:50] the brightness of his
[57:53] glory and the expressed in
[57:56] image of his
[57:59] person and upholding All Things by the
[58:05] word of his power when he hath by
[58:09] himself purged our sins sat down on the
[58:13] right hand of the Majesty on high what a
[58:17] description of this
[58:19] gift the gift that he gave you was the
[58:24] brightness
[58:26] of his glory and the expressed image of
[58:31] his person can you imagine God giving
[58:37] you the expressed image of his
[58:41] person God's giving you his
[58:44] person the expression and the image of
[58:49] the person of God has been given to you
[58:53] as a gift
[58:58] oh wouldn't you like to know the king
[59:03] well you know the King of Kings you
[59:06] you've been given the expressed image of
[59:09] God what kind of great gift is this this
[59:12] first gift that God gave and and he gave
[59:16] it because he loved you that this is
[59:18] this gift just as we look at this he
[59:21] said being made so much better than the
[59:24] angels and
[59:26] he as he hath by inheritance obtained
[59:30] more excellent Name than they so he
[59:34] wants us to understand God's just not
[59:36] sending down an
[59:39] angel okay this isn't just uh uh some uh
[59:45] spiritual
[59:47] fella you know what I mean or or some
[59:50] angel or uh or some lesser uh emissary
[59:56] you know it's like you it's like in the
[59:58] government and in in stuff like that of
[1:00:01] course you'd like the king to come to
[1:00:02] your birthday party but because you
[1:00:05] don't really cut have much cut much
[1:00:08] mustard with the King he he sends maybe
[1:00:12] a lower
[1:00:14] adversary you know you might get a a a a
[1:00:18] duke or
[1:00:20] something you know instead of the king
[1:00:23] you know you you get uh you you you
[1:00:26] maybe not even get a
[1:00:28] prince but you just get somebody lower
[1:00:31] on the totem pole look he's saying this
[1:00:33] isn't an angel this isn't somebody
[1:00:37] Downstream this isn't a lower
[1:00:40] emary this is the highest dignitary that
[1:00:44] there is in the kingdom of God and he's
[1:00:47] just didn't come to visit you he is a
[1:00:50] gift to you so now you have them you
[1:00:54] possess them he's yours
[1:00:59] Hallelujah they more more excellent than
[1:01:03] they I would be happy with an
[1:01:07] angel in fact he gave us those
[1:01:11] two but this is a real gift that God
[1:01:14] gave because if God does anything he
[1:01:17] does it to the
[1:01:18] max you know what I mean he can't he
[1:01:21] can't do something he it's it if he
[1:01:24] could give us any anything better he
[1:01:27] would have this was the best gift he
[1:01:31] could give the first Christmas gift was
[1:01:34] the best gift ever given it was above
[1:01:37] the Angels it it's m It's a Wonderful
[1:01:40] what it is just this just this
[1:01:42] description of this first gift is so
[1:01:45] wonderful for for un which of the Angels
[1:01:50] said he at any time Thou Art my
[1:01:54] son this day have I begotten thee and
[1:01:58] again I will be be to him a father and
[1:02:02] he shall be my son so now we see the
[1:02:06] relationship of this gift that is not an
[1:02:09] angel It's the Son of
[1:02:12] God that's who God gave God so loved the
[1:02:16] world he gave his only begotten son so
[1:02:21] Paul's going back over this gift again
[1:02:23] talking to the Hebrew children he says
[1:02:26] this gift is the Son of
[1:02:30] God
[1:02:32] beautiful and again when he bringeth in
[1:02:36] the first begotten unto the world he
[1:02:39] said and let all the angels of God
[1:02:44] worship him so this gift is above the
[1:02:48] angels and I I just kind of keep
[1:02:50] dwelling as we talk about this this gift
[1:02:54] is given to you you for you to
[1:03:03] possess it's for you for you to if I
[1:03:06] could use this expression for you to
[1:03:09] use and to
[1:03:12] have let's talk about it a little more
[1:03:15] and the angel said who maketh his Angel
[1:03:19] spirits and his Ministers of flame of
[1:03:23] fire but unto the son hath
[1:03:26] said so he's expressing what he made
[1:03:29] Angels right angels are ministering
[1:03:32] spirits that they they're uh you know
[1:03:36] they have they're they're Ministers of
[1:03:38] the flame of fire and their Living
[1:03:41] spirit but he said unto his son he has
[1:03:44] said again describing this gift and its
[1:03:48] important and its position in the
[1:03:52] Kingdom
[1:03:56] you understand so oh I I like that amen
[1:04:01] I mean you
[1:04:04] know it's it's just not it's it's nice
[1:04:09] you know it's nice to
[1:04:11] know my son has a friend that works in
[1:04:14] the white house so he sent us pictures
[1:04:16] they got him into the White House and he
[1:04:18] can walk in the places the White House
[1:04:20] he's allowed to go but man if you knew
[1:04:23] the
[1:04:24] president you could go in and have a
[1:04:26] sandwich at the kitchen
[1:04:30] table you understand so he wants you to
[1:04:33] understand the position of the person
[1:04:35] that you have a gift you know and so we
[1:04:39] have even the expression in the world it
[1:04:42] it it's not what you know it's who you
[1:04:45] know so he he's telling you this gift
[1:04:49] okay think of this wonderful Jesus that
[1:04:52] he the Lord's given us but he said to
[1:04:55] his son thy Throne oh God is forever and
[1:04:59] ever a seler of righteousness is the
[1:05:04] seler of the
[1:05:06] Kingdom that's what he has the seler of
[1:05:09] the
[1:05:11] Kingdom thou hath loved righteousness
[1:05:14] and hateth iniquity therefore God even
[1:05:19] thy God hath anointed thee with the oil
[1:05:23] of gladness above thy
[1:05:28] fellows look at his look at him and the
[1:05:32] Lord and and thou Lord in the beginning
[1:05:38] hath laid the foundations of the earth
[1:05:42] and the heavens are the works of thy
[1:05:46] hands now now now let's look at how he's
[1:05:50] going to describe this gift okay and
[1:05:54] he's going to
[1:05:56] compare this gift uh you can buy
[1:06:00] somebody a
[1:06:02] gift and it could wear out or it could
[1:06:07] break you know you know how they get you
[1:06:10] when you buy something and they said do
[1:06:12] you want the five-year protection plan
[1:06:15] for
[1:06:17] 1895 and the first thing you're thinking
[1:06:19] is it going to need it
[1:06:25] you know what I mean so you buy
[1:06:29] it you know because if you lose it or it
[1:06:32] breaks you know they just replace it
[1:06:34] provided they don't go out of business
[1:06:37] and so you buy the you buy the
[1:06:38] protection plan now he's going to
[1:06:41] describe this
[1:06:42] gift okay how enduring it
[1:06:46] is you understand the the the depth and
[1:06:49] the length and the breadth of this gift
[1:06:52] now you have this gift you may not know
[1:06:54] it
[1:06:56] you may not realize it but this is the
[1:06:59] first Christmas gift that God gave you
[1:07:04] he says he says and the in the beginning
[1:07:08] hath laid the foundations of the earth
[1:07:10] and the heavens are the work of thy
[1:07:12] hands and they in other words The Works
[1:07:15] of thy hands and they Shall
[1:07:19] Perish right heavens and earth shall
[1:07:23] pass away and so he's saying and they
[1:07:26] Shall
[1:07:27] Perish but thou
[1:07:30] remainest and they shall wax old as doth
[1:07:33] a
[1:07:36] garment and as a
[1:07:38] vest vesture shalt thou fold them up and
[1:07:43] they shall be changed but Thou Art the
[1:07:47] same and thy years shall not fail
[1:07:52] hallelujah amen this gift is going to
[1:07:55] Outlast the
[1:07:56] world Amen like the worlds fold up and
[1:08:00] they change everything but this gift
[1:08:02] will not change it'll be the same today
[1:08:06] tomorrow everything the same today
[1:08:09] yesterday forever it's Eternal gift it's
[1:08:12] an unchanging gift it remaineth the same
[1:08:17] Hallelujah that's what I like is
[1:08:19] something you can count on
[1:08:26] oh I like that but to which of the
[1:08:29] Angels said he at any time sit on my
[1:08:32] right hand until I make the enemies thy
[1:08:36] foot stol see he's trying to establish
[1:08:40] now that this is not just a spirit being
[1:08:44] he's now going to talk to us and
[1:08:48] show what he made this gift and why this
[1:08:54] gift is so valuable to
[1:08:58] you it's the maker of heaven and Earth
[1:09:00] it's everything else that he said but
[1:09:03] now it's got a
[1:09:05] particular
[1:09:07] identification with
[1:09:09] you it's got your name on it so it's got
[1:09:13] the ability not to be just everybody's
[1:09:18] gift but my
[1:09:21] gift tailored for me not just not just
[1:09:26] anybody's gift not this thing but but
[1:09:30] something that I is is
[1:09:33] beautiful and they are not and are they
[1:09:37] not all ministering Spirits sent forth
[1:09:40] to minister for them who shall be Heirs
[1:09:44] of Salvation now listen as we just go
[1:09:46] this last chapter this second chapter is
[1:09:49] wonderful therefore we ought to give the
[1:09:52] more Earnest heed to the things which we
[1:09:56] have heard lest at any time we should
[1:09:59] let them slip so remember what he spoke
[1:10:03] to us in times past and what did he
[1:10:06] speak to us of he spoke to us of eternal
[1:10:12] life the gift of God is eternal life
[1:10:17] through Christ Jesus
[1:10:20] amen for if the word spoken by Angels
[1:10:24] was steadfast fast and every
[1:10:27] transgression and disobedient receive
[1:10:30] the just recompense of reward how shall
[1:10:33] we escape if we neglect such a great
[1:10:40] gift because the gift of God is what
[1:10:45] salvation Salvation from what certain
[1:10:50] destruction and
[1:10:52] death he says he says so how shall we
[1:10:56] escape if we neglect such a great
[1:10:58] salvation which at the first began to be
[1:11:02] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:11:06] unto us by them that heard him so who he
[1:11:10] when he came this gift he started
[1:11:12] talking about what that he was bringing
[1:11:15] he was bringing eternal life amen he was
[1:11:18] bringing salvation he he was bringing
[1:11:22] something so the gift came and spoke of
[1:11:26] what that it was that the father was
[1:11:29] giving us and yet do we
[1:11:33] neglect such a great
[1:11:36] salvation and and we do neglect it in a
[1:11:40] way that we don't realize and we'll get
[1:11:43] to that quickly and then we'll take care
[1:11:45] of some other business it
[1:11:47] said it says
[1:11:50] uh God also bearing them witness both
[1:11:55] with signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:11:59] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:03] according to his own will so God bore
[1:12:06] witness of this
[1:12:09] gift its power its ability what it
[1:12:13] accomplishes the things it does and even
[1:12:16] the gift of the Holy Spirit Bears
[1:12:19] witness of this first gift in other
[1:12:22] words it's God saying I can
[1:12:25] give you anything better I gave you the
[1:12:30] best I gave you myself I gave you my son
[1:12:35] he's the he created the worlds he he has
[1:12:39] everything is subject to him just listen
[1:12:42] as he describes this gift I I I hope
[1:12:45] that you enjoy this it's wonderful to me
[1:12:48] he
[1:12:49] says For unto the Angels hath he not put
[1:12:55] in subjection the world to come whereof
[1:12:59] we
[1:13:00] speak the Angels aren't subject to the
[1:13:04] world to come but he is that the world's
[1:13:07] subject to him but one in it certain
[1:13:12] place testified saying what is
[1:13:15] man that thou art mindful of him or the
[1:13:19] son of man that thou shalt visit
[1:13:22] him oh you you see the gift what is man
[1:13:27] that you're even mindful of him son of
[1:13:29] man that should even visit him and yet
[1:13:32] God's saying this is the gift my son I'm
[1:13:36] mindful of you I'm visiting you I'm
[1:13:39] speaking to you of eternal life I'm
[1:13:43] speaking to you of Salvation it it's
[1:13:46] beautiful thou mest him but now listen
[1:13:49] to this beautiful
[1:13:51] gift but one in a certain place
[1:13:53] testified saying what is man that thou
[1:13:56] art mindful of him or the son of man
[1:13:58] that thou visited him thou mest him a
[1:14:02] little lower than the
[1:14:06] Angels now now he's starting to show
[1:14:11] that this gift identifies with us that's
[1:14:16] right how intimate this gift is how well
[1:14:20] planned this gift was he made his him a
[1:14:23] little lower than the
[1:14:25] Angels thou crownest him with glory and
[1:14:29] honor and did set him over the works of
[1:14:34] thy
[1:14:34] hands thou Hast put all things in
[1:14:38] subjection under his feet for in that he
[1:14:43] put all in subjection under him and left
[1:14:49] nothing that is not put under him
[1:14:58] nothing this gift you have everything is
[1:15:03] subject to the gift you
[1:15:06] have there's nothing that is not subject
[1:15:10] to
[1:15:12] him so now you can begin to see the
[1:15:16] power of the gift that you have he
[1:15:19] because but
[1:15:21] now we see not yet all things things put
[1:15:25] under him we don't even seen all the
[1:15:28] things those guys never seen what had to
[1:15:31] be put under his feet in this
[1:15:36] day they said we haven't seen everything
[1:15:39] that's put under his feet but we know
[1:15:40] they're all put under his feet why so
[1:15:43] that means when we come in this
[1:15:45] scientific education civilization tricky
[1:15:49] technological lion stinking
[1:15:52] Spirit-filled demon age it's still
[1:15:55] subject
[1:15:56] hallelujah hallelujah it don't
[1:16:00] matter this is the age he's going to
[1:16:02] appear as an angel of Light he's still
[1:16:06] subject all powers all principalities
[1:16:10] everything subject to him there's
[1:16:12] nothing that's not subject to him even
[1:16:14] though we haven't seen it yet it's still
[1:16:16] subject to him but we see Jesus
[1:16:20] Hallelujah who was made a little lower
[1:16:23] than the angels for the suffering of
[1:16:26] death amen crowned with Glory and
[1:16:30] Honor that he by the grace of God should
[1:16:35] taste death for every
[1:16:42] man yes sir oh your gift has tasted
[1:16:47] death so you

[1:16:55] death listen to this as this unfolds it
[1:16:58] it's it's just beautiful it it's just
[1:17:04] beautiful for every man for it became
[1:17:08] him for whom are all things and by whom
[1:17:16] all by whom are all
[1:17:20] things so it it became him for whom are
[1:17:26] all things so all things are for him and
[1:17:30] by whom are all things so all the things
[1:17:34] that are by him and he did this in
[1:17:38] bringing many sons unto
[1:17:43] glory amen that's why he became lower in
[1:17:46] the Angels that's why he tested death
[1:17:48] that's why he's everything subject to
[1:17:51] him so he could bring what sons and when
[1:17:54] when he say Sons that's Sons and
[1:17:56] Daughters unto glory to make the captain
[1:18:00] of their salvation perfect through
[1:18:04] suffering for both he that
[1:18:09] sanctifieth and they who are
[1:18:12] Sanctified are all of
[1:18:16] one for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:18:21] call them brethren oh my all this gift
[1:18:26] all this Glory all this Majesty all that
[1:18:29] he is now this gift comes and says I'm
[1:18:32] not ashamed to call you my brothers
[1:18:37] Amen in other words I'm one of you even
[1:18:41] though I'm all these other things even
[1:18:44] though I created heavens and earth I
[1:18:47] came down and tested death for you even
[1:18:50] though I everything's subject to me
[1:18:57] I'm not going to make you
[1:19:00] less than myself I'm going to call you
[1:19:06] brother and
[1:19:12] friend saying I will declare thy name
[1:19:16] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:19:20] church will I sing praise unto thee and
[1:19:24] again I will put my trust in him and
[1:19:28] again behold I and the children which
[1:19:33] God hath given
[1:19:35] me for so as much then as the children
[1:19:40] are partakers of Flesh and
[1:19:42] Blood he himself likewise took part of
[1:19:47] the same that through death he might
[1:19:51] destroy him that hath power of death
[1:19:56] that is the devil Hallelujah the devil's
[1:20:02] destroyed he don't know it but he's
[1:20:07] destroyed amen praise God that's why he
[1:20:13] come to call you Brethren and by by the
[1:20:17] reason that through death he might
[1:20:20] destroy him that hath the power of death
[1:20:25] Satan has the power of death he's the
[1:20:29] Destroyer he's the killer but the gift
[1:20:32] of God is eternal life
[1:20:37] amen that's what you get eternal life
[1:20:40] that's what he brought that's the gift
[1:20:41] of
[1:20:44] God and delivered
[1:20:47] them who through fear of death were all
[1:20:52] their lifetime so subject to
[1:20:57] bondage man all their lifetime was
[1:20:59] afraid to what to
[1:21:04] die let me tell you when you've got this
[1:21:07] gift you are not afraid to die because
[1:21:12] you don't
[1:21:15] die you don't die when you got this gift
[1:21:20] you don't die he destroyed the power of
[1:21:24] death that's the
[1:21:27] devil I like talking about
[1:21:30] Jesus for verily he took not on him the
[1:21:36] nature of
[1:21:39] angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:21:45] Abraham he became one of us wherefor in
[1:21:49] all
[1:21:51] things it behooved him
[1:21:54] to be made liken unto his
[1:21:59] Brethren it behooved him to be making
[1:22:03] liken unto his Brethren that he might be
[1:22:08] a merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:22:13] things P pertaining to God to make
[1:22:18] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:22:22] people what a
[1:22:25] gift what a nature what his purpose was
[1:22:30] to come and make
[1:22:32] reconciliation for our sins and give us
[1:22:35] life and as we begin to close here he
[1:22:41] says to
[1:22:43] make a high priest in all things
[1:22:46] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:22:50] for the sins of the people now this is
[1:22:53] the verse that I wanted to preach right
[1:22:56] here for in that he himself hath
[1:23:00] suffered being
[1:23:04] tempted and I think that's the hardest
[1:23:07] part that we go through in life is just
[1:23:10] being
[1:23:11] tempted but listen what he
[1:23:14] says and and hath suffered being
[1:23:18] tempted he is
[1:23:21] able to secure the them that are
[1:23:28] tempted and and S you know what that is
[1:23:32] let me let me read that with the
[1:23:36] definition and and it it says for in
[1:23:40] that he himself hath
[1:23:44] suffered being
[1:23:46] tempted he is able to
[1:23:50] assist and support in times of hardship
[1:23:54] ship and
[1:24:01] distress to them that are
[1:24:06] tempted that's this gift and it's just
[1:24:10] such a wonderful
[1:24:12] beautiful gift and I I just wanted to
[1:24:16] talk about it a little tonight because
[1:24:19] this was the first gift it was it was
[1:24:22] the a glorious that just to describe it
[1:24:26] we don't have words I thought Paul just
[1:24:28] trying to present him to the Hebrews
[1:24:31] this great gift of God and when it
[1:24:33] finally comes down to us he didn't come
[1:24:36] as an angel he didn't come as a king he
[1:24:40] came as a
[1:24:43] brother to be tempted like we were
[1:24:46] tempted so he could
[1:24:49] assist and
[1:24:51] support in the times of hardship and
[1:24:54] distress and in
[1:24:56] Temptation he's
[1:24:58] there you talk about a
[1:25:01] gift that's not
[1:25:04] used you talk about all the Temptations
[1:25:07] that we try to fight
[1:25:10] ourselves all the
[1:25:13] uncertainty that we go through and
[1:25:17] yet this
[1:25:20] gift
[1:25:22] became a brother yes and was tempted
[1:25:26] like we
[1:25:28] were so we could have a
[1:25:33] spiritual remote
[1:25:35] start to start our life up again to
[1:25:40] assist us in
[1:25:42] overcoming to help
[1:25:44] us in distress yeah and in times of
[1:25:49] hardship that's why he's an
[1:25:52] everlasting gift
[1:25:55] Heaven and Earth will pass away but he
[1:25:57] says I will not leave you nor forsake
[1:26:00] you but I'll be with you even in you
[1:26:04] till the end what a wonderful beautiful
[1:26:08] gift tonight we're going to turn the
[1:26:10] service back over to brother Billy as uh
[1:26:14] he'll lead us in worship and we're going

[1:34:58] the pool today wanting to give her heart
[1:35:02] to the Lord and and serve God and and I
[1:35:06] I I know she knows that the gift of God
[1:35:10] is the holy spirit which is life and and
[1:35:16] she just desires that that
[1:35:20] life and and that gift that comes from
[1:35:23] baptism ISM that she washes away her
[1:35:26] sins
[1:35:28] it's if you could say it The Bard
[1:35:31] chalkboard of her life is white clean
[1:35:35] and now the spirit of God comes and
[1:35:37] helps her build a new nature a new
[1:35:41] personality put work gifts and grow in
[1:35:44] the Statue of a perfect man and this is
[1:35:47] the starting place of every real
[1:35:50] Christian Life is with repentance and
[1:35:53] with the pool and as we got received
[1:35:57] from our study this evening that we
[1:36:01] needed that gift because without it we
[1:36:05] can do nothing but with him all things
[1:36:08] are possible in Christ Jesus so let us
[1:36:11] read our scriptures found in the book of
[1:36:13] Acts on the day of
[1:36:15] Pentecost where the
[1:36:17] disciples hearing the gospel that Jesus
[1:36:20] preached about the oncoming Kingdom they
[1:36:23] went in the upper room and they were
[1:36:25] filled with the spirit they came out on
[1:36:28] the street prophesying and people heard
[1:36:31] them in their tongues and their own
[1:36:33] languages and they were pricked in their
[1:36:35] heart and this is what it says and
[1:36:38] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:36:40] know
[1:36:41] assuredly that God hath made the same
[1:36:44] Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord
[1:36:48] and Christ and when they heard this they
[1:36:51] were pricked in their heart
[1:36:54] and said unto Peter and the rest of the
[1:36:57] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:37:00] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[1:37:05] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:37:08] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:37:11] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:37:14] the Holy ghosten for the promises unto
[1:37:17] you and to your children and to all that
[1:37:21] are a far off even as many as our Lord
[1:37:24] Our God shall call and with many other
[1:37:27] words did he testify and exhort saying
[1:37:32] save yourself from this up towards
[1:37:35] generation and that's what our sister is
[1:37:38] doing today amen
[1:37:43] turn in the scriptures Jesus spoke and
[1:37:46] he said go into all the world baptizing
[1:37:50] them in the name of the Father the Son
[1:37:54] and the Holy Spirit one name and Peter
[1:37:57] with the keys to the kingdom and a
[1:38:00] divine revelation of what that name was
[1:38:03] they baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:38:05] Jesus Christ and so according to the
[1:38:08] promise of God and the commission given
[1:38:10] to the church we baptize you now in the
[1:38:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
