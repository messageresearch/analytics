[1:42:02] let's pray Heavenly Father lorded struck
[1:42:07] my heart tonight Lord that through the
[1:42:09] time you've sent us a wonderful man Lord
[1:42:12] there were men that stopped the Sun
[1:42:14] there were men that needed to cross over
[1:42:17] the Red Sea and you allowed him to part
[1:42:19] the sea or there were men that spoke
[1:42:21] fished or back into give him life or but
[1:42:25] no man was sent to be perfect as your
[1:42:27] son Jesus Lord and you've given us
[1:42:30] glimpses Lord that we could attain to
[1:42:32] that even as brother Paul said tonight
[1:42:35] Lord you told us to be perfect Lord and
[1:42:37] it's not through anything that we've
[1:42:39] said or anything that we've done Lord
[1:42:40] but it's what your word says and we can
[1:42:43] only take you at that lord I ask that
[1:42:45] you would allow that to sink into our
[1:42:47] heart that when we listen to messages
[1:42:49] Lord when we do our family devotions
[1:42:51] when we hear the preaching of the word
[1:42:53] lord help us they get our eyes off this
[1:42:56] flesh and our mistakes and the things
[1:42:57] that we go wayward or but maybe we focus
[1:43:01] on your word and service after service
[1:43:03] or you're calling us perfect Lord you're
[1:43:05] telling us where your bride you're
[1:43:07] telling us to quit look at the past quit
[1:43:09] looking at the mistakes Lord you're
[1:43:11] telling us to look at before the
[1:43:13] foundation of the war of the world Lord
[1:43:16] when that when we were predestinated
[1:43:18] Lord with that lamb was slain father
[1:43:21] when there was a people that were
[1:43:23] created in your mind that would be
[1:43:24] perfect and it would come down to the
[1:43:26] end time or that's what you're telling
[1:43:28] us to focus on help us store to keep our
[1:43:31] mind lower stayed on you Lord looking to
[1:43:33] the heavenlies Lord looking towards this
[1:43:35] Redemption and rapture Lord that's
[1:43:37] taking place father I ask that you would
[1:43:40] just help us or give us faith Lord when
[1:43:42] we get down and out or do we get looking
[1:43:45] to the left and to the right Lord help
[1:43:47] it to bring our attention back Lord and
[1:43:49] may we stay focused on you and your word
[1:43:50] and what you have for us we love you
[1:43:53] Lord and commit these things into your
[1:43:54] hands we ask it in Jesus name
[1:43:57] amen god bless you let's in greater is
[1:44:05] He that is in me as our dismissal
