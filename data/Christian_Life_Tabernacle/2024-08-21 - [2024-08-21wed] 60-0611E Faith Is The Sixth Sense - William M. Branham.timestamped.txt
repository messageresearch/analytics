[18:56] amen Amen brother Philip andrez a tonen
[19:00] if you could come at this
[19:08] time uh good
[19:11] evening sorry I'm a bit nervous but uh
[19:16] so I'll just kind of jump into the
[19:19] story so probably what was it
[19:23] October I think it was October 30th or
[19:28] 29th something around that
[19:30] time so I was overh helping
[19:33] Davey and uh I'd walked up this ladder
[19:35] and I was putting down this fish tank
[19:38] put it down and the ladder slipped back
[19:39] and I fell off the ladder onto my back
[19:42] which was quite traumatizing at the time
[19:44] it hurt I got up walked for a little bit
[19:47] and then I couldn't walk and so they
[19:48] took me to the emergency
[19:49] room and uh so when they went to there
[19:52] like I bruised up my hip
[19:56] and a little bit but when the doctor
[19:59] actually they did a trauma scan and when
[20:01] the doctor got back he wasn't concerned
[20:04] about the bruises or anything cuz what
[20:06] they' found what they call an incidental
[20:08] find of an aortic
[20:11] aneurysm
[20:12] which at the time was like what's that
[20:15] so I looked it up
[20:17] um and looking if you look up what an
[20:21] aortic aneurism it is not so what it is
[20:24] is you have it on your um for me
[20:28] particular it's on the trachea it's
[20:30] where the blood vein that runs off your
[20:33] heart is larger than it should be sort
[20:35] of like blowing up like a balloon to a
[20:37] certain
[20:38] degree and typically the first thing it
[20:41] likes to throw on there is statistics of
[20:43] if this bursts because that is the
[20:45] concern with an aortic aneurysm as it
[20:46] gets larger it increases the chances
[20:49] that it's going to burst and it's like
[20:52] pretty much if this bursts it's going to
[20:54] kill you unless you are already in the
[20:57] hospital the time that it'll B lead your
[20:59] you out will pretty much kill
[21:01] you which reading that straight up
[21:07] terrifying like hold on
[21:11] what and in a lot of ways that that that
[21:15] weighed heavily on my spirit for a long
[21:18] time
[21:20] now the doctors didn't NE they try not
[21:23] to tell you that because they know that
[21:24] it will terrify you and
[21:28] in a lot of ways it'll increase your
[21:30] blood pressure which pushes pressure on
[21:31] it makes it hurt but of course I looked
[21:33] it up immediately
[21:37] and which caused it to hurt to a certain
[21:39] extent and so like when you're feeling
[21:42] for they determine the risk based on
[21:45] size and pain and so now that I'm
[21:48] thinking about it it starts to hurt and
[21:51] so you start worrying about it so it
[21:52] starts to hurt
[21:54] more and that's its own spiral into the
[21:57] the ground
[21:59] and
[22:01] so a lot of times like your chest is
[22:04] hurting and so what they say to do is go
[22:05] to the emergency room so you go to the
[22:07] emergency room they're like it's fine so
[22:10] you go back but then you're walking
[22:12] through your day-to-day and you still
[22:14] have that like chest pain and it creates
[22:16] a lot of concern and so when
[22:19] uh brother Matthew spoke his sermon and
[22:23] like they've been preaching on fear for
[22:26] like two or three sermons and it really
[22:28] it really hit me because in a lot of
[22:30] ways that was absolutely terrifying
[22:34] me
[22:37] and a lot of and I I really had to sit
[22:41] down and pray and like Lord you are in
[22:45] in
[22:46] control and what it be you you will lead
[22:50] it for the better and just surrender it
[22:52] to the Lord and look better and in doing
[22:56] so like you're not worried about it as
[22:57] much because you've trusted to the Lord
[22:59] and it reduces the pain and so you're
[23:01] not like listening to the devil in the
[23:03] back of your head who's like oh you're
[23:05] about to kill over and
[23:08] so instead of listening to that is just
[23:11] surrender to the Lord and so I just want
[23:13] to thank him for
[23:16] [Applause]
[23:23] that amen isn't it wonderful amen
[23:31] amen fear will not help you but faith
[23:34] will sign your pardon amen that's what
[23:37] we'll believe amen give me key of um hey
[23:43] amen Lord my heart can
[23:50] grow so far away and
[23:56] cold oh and by yet and for me your love
[24:02] is still the
[24:06] [Music]
[24:09] same oh
[24:11] [Music]
[24:15] and oh and in and fear of
[24:22] me oh and my head bow down in red

[28:08] King
[28:09] hallelujah amen let's all stand tonight
[28:13] amen we're going to open our Bibles amen
[28:15] we're going to be reading uh we we'll
[28:17] listen to a portion of a tape uh tonight
[28:21] let's just open our Bibles in Hebrews uh
[28:23] 11
[28:40] man it says faith is the substance of
[28:43] things hope for the evidence of Things
[28:46] Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a
[28:49] good report through faith we understand
[28:53] that the world were framed by the word
[28:55] of God so that things which are seen
[28:58] were not made of things that do appear
[29:01] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[29:05] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[29:08] he obtained witness that he was
[29:10] righteous God testifying of his own gift
[29:14] and by it he him being dead yet speaketh
[29:19] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[29:22] should not see death and was not found
[29:25] because God had translated him for
[29:28] before his translation he had this
[29:30] testimony that he pleased God but
[29:34] without faith it's impossible to please
[29:37] him for he that cometh to God must
[29:40] believe that he is and that he is a
[29:42] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[29:45] Him by faith Noah being warned of God of
[29:50] things not not seen as yet moved with
[29:54] fear prepared enough for the saving of
[29:57] his house house it says by by by the
[30:01] which he he condemned the world and
[30:05] became an heir unto righteousness which
[30:08] is by faith our father we ask that you
[30:11] bless your word tonight to us we commit
[30:13] everything we are and ask it in the name
[30:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may
[30:17] have your
[30:21] seats so I
[30:25] was thinking about preaching tonight but
[30:28] it just so happened I was thinking about
[30:31] the just the the services if you really
[30:35] um uh you know I always think it's
[30:38] amazing how the Lord will open up a door
[30:41] and every Minister will almost just line
[30:44] up and it's not like we talk to one
[30:46] another but you just gets inspired this
[30:49] one preached that one gets inspired we
[30:51] we we we it just seems to be a string of
[30:54] the word just tying
[30:56] together and so so much is being said
[30:59] about faith and I was thinking and this
[31:01] tape came to my heart you know the name
[31:03] of it is Faith is the six sense and
[31:06] there's this portion where I feel like
[31:09] baram just takes everything that's been
[31:12] preached and just combine it in about 40
[31:14] minutes and if you really pay close
[31:17] attention you will really this will
[31:19] really be a blessing because I believe
[31:22] that the purpose of preaching is to
[31:24] inspire faith if we cannot Inspire faith
[31:28] we have failed we don't know what we are
[31:30] doing here the purpose of preaching is
[31:33] to inspire Faith so that faith can
[31:36] operate in the heart of a Believer and
[31:38] produce what God is looking for because
[31:41] without if otherwise if we do it by
[31:44] knowledge knowledge is not going to be
[31:45] helpful knowledge will will help you
[31:48] have a bunch of things that you know but
[31:51] that are not applicable to anything
[31:53] knowledge will cause confusion knowledge
[31:56] will get to a place where it's going to
[31:58] fail you but faith will hold you up no
[32:00] matter what the circumstance is so I was
[32:03] thinking about this in and and this is
[32:06] just me trying to summarize everything
[32:08] about what we're going to hear I I
[32:10] thought from my heart this is the very
[32:13] fundamental of what faith
[32:16] is and how Faith Works and how do we
[32:22] act and put faith in action so I I
[32:25] really want you to pay attention to when
[32:27] we're going to
[32:28] here you hear him talk and and he's it's
[32:32] a it's before a prayer line so he's
[32:34] really going quick you know how it does
[32:36] it just jumps from one or another just
[32:38] trying to compile really quick to build
[32:41] up Faith in the people and and one of
[32:44] the things you really realize that we
[32:46] are really made to live by faith and not
[32:49] by
[32:50] sight and and and 90% or 100% of the
[32:54] time when we fail is because we go by
[32:57] knowledge rather than by faith we we let
[33:00] the word uh and I'm not saying anything
[33:03] bad about what what we know we know so
[33:07] much and not of what the prophet said in
[33:11] fact someone can be reading a quote you
[33:13] already know how to finish that quot and
[33:15] I think that's wonderful because we have
[33:17] to be students of the message and the
[33:20] Bible but there's an element of faith
[33:23] that God is
[33:24] requiring because really faith is the
[33:27] only Supernatural element about us faith
[33:31] is made so it will take you in your
[33:34] flesh as you are connect you to the
[33:37] kingdom of God so you have access to
[33:39] what the Supernatural is yes sir it is
[33:44] not a natural you're not you you you
[33:47] didn't study enough to create Faith In
[33:49] Yourself is a supernatural element that
[33:53] contacts the Supernatural and brings the
[33:55] supernatural into manifestation
[33:58] and and so that's why the prophet will
[34:01] say we the Revelation can never be
[34:04] overemphasized because that's what we
[34:07] live
[34:08] by and so you will hear him say that and
[34:12] so the you also see and and I and I I
[34:16] just want to say this because when we
[34:18] speak about faith there is instances
[34:20] where the Prophet will talk about one
[34:23] coming on the prayer line and and either
[34:25] you know but will say did you feel this
[34:28] did you see this and and they will
[34:29] believe and and they will pray and they
[34:31] will believe and they will go on
[34:33] believing that God did something for
[34:34] them but I thought this was so wonderful
[34:37] because this is what the if the very
[34:41] fundamental Faith was that you one would
[34:45] come and it will be prayed for and I
[34:47] thought I was thinking about the the
[34:49] testimony our sister Heidi came and gave
[34:52] that the people will come and give a
[34:55] testimony without
[34:57] any proof of anything having changed and
[35:03] and hear me out because this is the
[35:06] faith that moves the mountain it's not
[35:08] because you see the mountain crumbling
[35:11] then you have faith no this is nothing
[35:14] has changed everything is exactly the
[35:18] same but God quickens in the hearts of
[35:21] the believer something and they are able
[35:23] to stand there and proclaim the word of
[35:26] God and by doing so it causes the
[35:29] mountain to
[35:31] crumble and that's why I said the very
[35:34] fundamental so if we were to get out of
[35:36] here and say I want to know how Faith
[35:39] Works just listen to what the prophet
[35:41] said you will understand it's not one
[35:44] that you come up and you jump and you
[35:46] feel oh the you prayed for and you feel
[35:49] and I'm not taking that away the are
[35:51] people the the People Prayed for it
[35:54] happens right away there's people they
[35:56] come on the prayer line some thing they
[35:58] came and they they they walk away well
[36:00] and all of that but the fundamental of
[36:02] faith is based upon I am believing what
[36:06] God has said even though with the
[36:08] natural eyes I'm not seeing anything but
[36:11] I believe the word and the word performs
[36:14] what you are looking for I believe the
[36:17] word because something within my heart
[36:19] is believing and you stand there and
[36:22] Faith goes to work for you but whenham
[36:25] says this um in one place he says and
[36:30] and he says it says we are grateful to
[36:33] God and that we have the five senses but
[36:37] by no means were these s given to us to
[36:41] guide
[36:42] you it says they were given to you for
[36:45] you to uh for your Earthly contact but
[36:48] there was one given to you the six sense
[36:51] and that six sense is belonging it
[36:54] belongs only to the Christians
[36:59] something that was given to contact God
[37:02] and it says it's only given and you
[37:04] cannot have the six sense until you are
[37:08] be you have become a Christian he said
[37:11] in another place and the super sense is
[37:14] the Holy Spirit the faith of God that
[37:18] dwells in
[37:20] you it says and if we'll if we it says
[37:25] if we will let the five senses be
[37:28] yielded by the six sense it will give
[37:31] you it will guide you and and bring you
[37:34] all the senses under control of that one
[37:37] super
[37:39] sense the scripture will say in John 5
[37:43] and4 it says 1 John 5 and4 it says
[37:46] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[37:50] world it says this is the victory that
[37:52] overcometh the world even of Faith so
[37:56] it's to say that it's the element of
[37:59] Faith that's the the instrument by which
[38:02] we overcome the things of the world it's
[38:05] not because we've gained knowledge it's
[38:07] not because we've gained access and we
[38:09] know this we know that it's not because
[38:11] of what we strive after but God gives
[38:14] you the faith in order for you to be an
[38:18] overcomer in in in the message
[38:21] preparation baram says he says he can't
[38:24] do anything for us till we accept it
[38:28] and say that we have accepted it and
[38:30] believe it and then he says and testify
[38:33] of it is that right he says he can do
[38:37] nothing no matter what you've got to
[38:40] accept it first by faith and believe it
[38:42] and
[38:43] confess confess that it's right and
[38:46] before God makes it right it says in
[38:51] your steady it says in your before God
[38:54] makes it right in your stead as the
[38:57] heart high priest so God wants us to
[38:59] move by faith to to believe by faith to
[39:03] take it by faith then he comes as the
[39:06] high priest to make it
[39:08] happen he says that but but but he
[39:12] cannot touch he says the devil the the
[39:16] devil can get into the five senses and
[39:19] lie to you but he cannot touch the super
[39:24] sense that's as far as that's that's far
[39:27] far beyond his reach brother bam says
[39:30] the super sense controls natural senses
[39:34] the super sense is something that will
[39:37] make you believe God's word and it says
[39:42] and if you would only be spiritual and
[39:44] use the six sense how many things you
[39:48] would
[39:50] bypass I
[39:52] thought we could bypass a lot of pain a
[39:56] lot of headaches
[39:57] a lot of things if we would approach it
[40:00] and believe God by the super sense by
[40:03] the fifth by the F the the six sense and
[40:06] see what God is is is wanting to do with
[40:09] us so it's not long it's only 40 minutes
[40:12] um and I I I don't want to go through it
[40:16] but as we go through you will just hear
[40:18] how and I I I really want you to focus
[40:21] on the fundamental on how God is
[40:24] operating and how Faith the faith of God
[40:27] is moving in the people and bringing the
[40:30] word of God to come to pass so God bless
[40:32] you let's listen to it and then and then
[40:34] we'll close it's only 40 minutes it's
[40:36] not going to be too
[40:40] long it delivers us and rescues us from
[40:44] our five senses that we were put in in
[40:47] the beginning and that fifth sense down
[40:49] here the five senses man fell there with
[40:53] them
[40:55] senses by his appetite
[40:57] now
[40:59] notice that these senses was given to
[41:02] you to only to contact your Earthly home
[41:07] that you might see taste feel smell and
[41:09] hear but they're by no means to lead you
[41:14] and now many times what if I refuse to
[41:18] look anymore and I just bind up my eyes
[41:21] and say I refuse to look all right my
[41:25] eyes can't serve me no more more well
[41:28] then I finally I'll go
[41:31] blind and then when my Boy comes on I'll
[41:35] tie his eyes up and say no sir there's
[41:36] no such a thing as tight I just tie his
[41:39] eyes up don't let him see he said my
[41:43] father told me there was no such a thing
[41:44] as s so I'll tie up my boy's eyes well
[41:48] the first thing you know our generation
[41:51] would be born
[41:54] blind right if you don't use your six
[41:57] senses they become dment they won't act
[42:00] at all brother that's what the church
[42:04] has done to the six sense not putting in
[42:09] he's just placed Faith Off In Miracles
[42:11] and signs and the things that contacts
[42:14] God and gives him the Holy Ghost and
[42:15] things he's placed that off over there
[42:17] or back over here somewhere till the
[42:19] thing has become
[42:21] dead right we don't know how to use it
[42:26] the things that's nothing doing you say
[42:28] well God's A Healer oh what about that
[42:31] God's A Healer if he ever was a Healer
[42:34] he's still a
[42:36] Healer if he ever was a savior he's
[42:38] still a savior if he ever was God he's
[42:41] still
[42:44] God so you see it's a lack of faith
[42:47] that's been preached into the people
[42:49] that makes them let that six sense which
[42:52] is Faith laid dant and Through the Years
[42:56] they'll run out these sick and run to
[42:57] the doctor and say doctor oh I got
[42:59] something wrong with me doctor look at
[43:01] say you'll try a man of good honest
[43:03] doctor or work this as patiently as he
[43:05] can with all the power that God will
[43:08] give him to operate and do things that
[43:10] he should do to help you then the first
[43:12] thing you know it advances on well he
[43:14] says I just have to tell you uh there's
[43:17] nothing more that I can do if you want
[43:19] to go to another doctor go see well then
[43:22] you go to another doctor and you say no
[43:24] nothing can be done it's too far
[43:25] Advanced now now that is the time that's
[43:30] the time to call on the six
[43:32] sense that's the time to accept
[43:36] God that's the time to rely upon the
[43:40] spirit of faith that God has put in you
[43:43] and now when it's been people been
[43:45] taught against it so long it makes it
[43:49] hard brother Bose was telling me they
[43:51] said brother brand I never realize what
[43:53] you bucked against see you don't realize
[43:56] what it is what a hard thing when you
[43:59] bring and the power of God will come
[44:01] right down so real to the people they
[44:04] can look and see the spirit moving among
[44:06] the people and doing things and someone
[44:07] sit there and say oh if you just do this
[44:09] or do this or do that or something other
[44:11] maybe it would help me old brother if
[44:14] that six sense could understand what
[44:17] we've been preaching about this week
[44:20] amen that the Holy Ghost God made this
[44:23] promise Christ made the promise we Puck
[44:26] it through the scriptures this week back
[44:27] and forth and back and forth and comb it
[44:29] over until we know that God promised to
[44:33] do this thing he is doing now in this
[44:35] day the supernatural now real genuine
[44:40] faith that see that and catch a hold of
[44:42] it and all Devils Out of Hell will never
[44:44] Shake him away from
[44:47] it but we stumble at it it's not used
[44:50] enough we depend too much on the five
[44:53] and once most of the time the 95% of the
[44:56] people are better as soon as they see
[44:58] the five senses is finished well it's
[45:00] all gone dig my grave get my casket
[45:03] ready see oh I was thinking of a little
[45:06] woman here I had on interviews a day or
[45:08] two ago I don't see him here now a man's
[45:11] name is uh kind of a D Dash or do and
[45:17] his wife she had a dream and she come
[45:19] telling me the dream and she said
[45:22] brother brandom I I dream that the devil
[45:25] come upside of my bed and he looked over
[45:27] at me and begin to make ging funny uh
[45:31] faces at me and said I got you now and
[45:35] said I just something happened to me and
[45:37] I jumped up out of the bed and said get
[45:39] out of here devil in the name of Jesus
[45:41] and started running him and he run out
[45:43] of the house and she said I don't
[45:45] understand what that means then the holy
[45:47] spirit being present give the
[45:49] interpretation just a little after that
[45:52] her husband had a heart attack and when
[45:54] she seen her husband fall and he's an
[45:57] aged man heavy man and his hands went
[46:00] back and his eyes set death come to take
[46:03] him but God wasn't through with him that
[46:05] little woman's Faith raised up and said
[46:07] I won't stand for it I call for his life
[46:11] in the name of Jesus
[46:14] Christ he got well see why that six
[46:18] sense roll up that crucial moment that
[46:21] time that give her faith God had give
[46:23] her the dream though had not been
[46:25] interpreted to her yet I said there
[46:26] there's your interpretation a little
[46:28] fellow just begins screaming and
[46:29] praising God she said that's exactly the
[46:30] way it happened see that's now that's
[46:33] goes into Grace see give her the dream
[46:36] not even knowing what it was but God is
[46:38] thankful and loyal anyhow to keep his
[46:41] people posted if we would only be
[46:43] spiritual and use that six sense we ohe
[46:46] how many things we could bypass how many
[46:49] things we'd know if the church was an
[46:50] order where the spirits and Gifts of the
[46:53] church would be operating we'd have Anon
[46:56] Sur laying all over everywhere that's
[46:59] right sin would be out of the church but
[47:03] we become so Earthbound with our
[47:05] senses just so well if they can't see it
[47:09] if I can't and then them senses the
[47:12] devil gets into those senses and he'll
[47:14] let you see something with your eyes and
[47:16] then disbelieve it anyhow because many
[47:20] times you kept your eyes close along
[47:21] until you're
[47:23] blind a fellow said to me one time said
[47:26] smile me blind smite me blind you
[47:28] believe in Divine Healing same holy
[47:30] ghost that Paul preached smite me blind
[47:32] I said I can't do it because you're
[47:34] already
[47:37] blind I said your father the devil did
[47:40] that a long time ago see you you you
[47:44] you're already blind for the Bible said
[47:46] he's blind this gospel is is it's hid to
[47:49] anybody it's those that are blind that
[47:52] hasn't tried to use their senses the
[47:55] sense of God gave them that sense if
[47:59] it's used it's a sense of Deliverance
[48:01] when the other five
[48:04] fail by this sense there's been great
[48:06] things done here some time ago in one of
[48:09] my
[48:10] meetings there was a lady come across
[48:12] the
[48:13] platform and she had a a cered stomach
[48:17] bleeding and the Holy Spirit began to
[48:20] speak which she know I couldn't do that
[48:22] and told her who she was where' she come
[48:24] from she had an uler stomach now when
[48:26] got through it said thus sayith the Lord
[48:28] your
[48:30] heel and she went home and there was a a
[48:33] lady neighborhood was way on down the
[48:36] prayer line when it comes she had a
[48:37] growth on her throat and when the prayer
[48:41] line got down to her it said to her said
[48:44] told her who she was where' she come
[48:46] from all about it she said That's All
[48:48] Right Said thus sayith the Lord you're
[48:51] healed and so them two women went that
[48:53] night got together they didn't feel any
[48:56] difference
[48:57] that don't have anything to do with it
[48:59] that doesn't have one thing to do with
[49:01] where you feel you you don't you get
[49:02] away from these feelings if you're going
[49:04] to rely on them you can't rely on that
[49:06] because it's the evidence of things you
[49:08] don't see taste see or smell or
[49:11] here it's another sense watch what
[49:15] happened about two weeks past this woman
[49:17] with the uler in stomach she tried to
[49:19] eat and she just like to die but she
[49:22] still maintained she said there's
[49:24] something Supernatural about it because
[49:27] the man never seen me in his life and
[49:28] yet he told me who it was and it's got
[49:31] to be Godly because it Compares with the
[49:34] Bible see and she said and I know that
[49:37] fellow heard him preach and he's
[49:38] uneducated he knows nothing about these
[49:40] things and told me all about it and the
[49:42] same man said thus sayeth the
[49:46] Lord if he's a servant of God he
[49:48] couldn't say that if he just thought it
[49:50] it's the Holy Spirit talking through him
[49:53] that you are healed and she kept on and
[49:55] her her h husband was a Christian her
[49:58] children and she said and she goes see
[50:01] her little lady frame down the street
[50:02] from her had a not no difference but
[50:04] both of them purposed in their heart
[50:06] that they had accepted that to be God
[50:09] and that's all there was to it one
[50:11] morning the children was gone to school
[50:13] and she's standing washing the dishes
[50:16] and she just could hardly eat anything
[50:17] because the aler would just burn her up
[50:20] she was washing the dishes and she said
[50:22] all at once a real cool feeling come
[50:25] over and she went on thought what was
[50:27] that I just felt so funny just real
[50:30] light and a cool feeling well she just
[50:32] went on washing the dishes in a few
[50:35] moments she got real hungry so she goes
[50:38] over at the at the table and the
[50:40] children had left some oatmeal in a dish
[50:43] so she dipped up that oatmeal in a spoon
[50:46] and she ate it and a little bite of
[50:49] toast she thought well as usual I bombit
[50:51] it up maybe in a few minutes and so she
[50:54] um went on the first thing you know it
[50:56] was all right right went on she got all
[50:58] right then she went over and tasted it
[51:01] again it was all right then she really
[51:03] had a gastronomical jubilees she goes
[51:06] over and Fries her a couple of eggs a
[51:08] big bunch of bacon got her a cup of
[51:09] coffee and she really eat she went on
[51:12] washing the dishes around a little while
[51:13] then she got up on her feet she felt
[51:15] fine she raised up her hands and begin
[51:17] to praise God run down the street she's
[51:19] go tell her sister about what happened
[51:21] when she got down there this little lady
[51:23] was Walking the Floor shaking the Sheep
[51:25] just as hard as she could said well
[51:26] what's the matter sister said look that
[51:28] thing's gone off my neck I can't find it
[51:30] in the sheet I can't find it anywhere at
[51:31] all it was gone what was
[51:35] it because they held on to that six
[51:39] sense how the word of God that wouldn't
[51:41] take no for an
[51:44] answer they come to the meeting about
[51:46] two months after that both of them
[51:47] showed me how they were healed and
[51:49] everything what was it the six sense
[51:52] that six sense that sense of power that
[51:55] thing that delivered him not because I
[51:58] prayed but because that they believed
[52:01] that's it that done it now there was up
[52:04] at the cadle Tabernacle up in
[52:06] Indianapolis or down from here it is the
[52:09] Indianapolis they had a a boy that had

[54:51] taking a little uh recess from standing
[54:54] in the prayer line long he said brother

[59:19] to the ministry and he was going out to
[59:21] preach the gospel oh my what is it

[59:27] sense Faith said so he said I kept that
[59:30] in my heart if God could do such a thing
[59:33] to others he can do it for my wife he
[59:35] kept holding on to that nothing would
[59:37] separate him from it that's what that
[59:39] six sense will do when it's turned loose
[59:41] and let it have its controlling power

[1:09:02] in a tent just the top of the hill and
[1:09:04] while I was out there in the water of

[1:09:07] that the angels of God are sitting along
[1:09:09] and every one of his congregation that
[1:09:11] muddy water with pretty white dresses on
[1:09:13] walked out there and was baptizing

[1:24:50] cards anytime you're going through a bad
[1:24:53] day just put one of them
[1:24:55] tapes you you will woke up and just feel
[1:24:58] like Victorious and just still walking
[1:25:00] around and praising God we have the word
[1:25:04] with us and he keeps saying holding on
[1:25:07] to the six sense holding on to the six
[1:25:10] sense it he went from one example to
[1:25:13] another from one to another in every
[1:25:16] circumstance they were holding on to the
[1:25:18] six sense that's where our Victory lies
[1:25:22] a victory doesn't lie in the mult
[1:25:24] multitude of thinking and and whoo is me
[1:25:27] how do I get out of this and what do I
[1:25:29] do no take the word of God stand there
[1:25:32] and Proclaim it to be true stand there
[1:25:36] no matter what the circumstance looks
[1:25:38] like holding on to the six sense I I I
[1:25:42] just feel like going through and reading
[1:25:44] it but I I I just know that you heard it
[1:25:46] and it was so wonderful if the musician
[1:25:48] could come oh I tell you it's just so
[1:25:52] inspiring to know that th now this was
[1:25:55] not done 2,000 years ago this is Jesus
[1:25:59] Christ
[1:26:02] today this is Jesus Christ today in his
[1:26:06] church in his Believers this is what
[1:26:10] he's doing not what he's going to do
[1:26:12] this is what he's
[1:26:14] doing what we need is just to believe
[1:26:16] the word and and sometimes I feel like
[1:26:19] we we we don't like embarrassment we
[1:26:21] don't like to put ourselves out there
[1:26:23] well if I do it people are going to
[1:26:24] laugh at me what if it doesn't happen it
[1:26:27] doesn't matter it's not up to you to
[1:26:29] manifest it it's up to him to manifest
[1:26:32] it once it quickens your heart you stand
[1:26:35] there no matter what the ridicule is
[1:26:38] because you're no longer standing upon
[1:26:39] your own word you standing on God's word
[1:26:42] and he's responsible to bring it to come
[1:26:45] to
[1:26:46] pass the secret of Faith the fundamental
[1:26:49] of faith is that I heard the word I
[1:26:53] believe it and no matter no matter what
[1:26:54] I'm going to stand on it and it's not
[1:26:57] what if it doesn't it will transpire
[1:27:00] because God said we will do it according
[1:27:03] to his word and those that believe God
[1:27:05] will come and testify of his own word if
[1:27:08] we could
[1:27:12] stand now you see why I didn't preach it
[1:27:15] so he he just packs it in there I I I
[1:27:19] feel like it's just like just a boost of
[1:27:22] faith and and it just comes in and it
[1:27:24] just raises up and and if you are there
[1:27:27] how do you not just get in and feel like
[1:27:30] that same God who healed 2,000 years ago
[1:27:33] he was here to do the same thing and
[1:27:35] because banam is not here doesn't mean
[1:27:38] God is gone he's here in his people to
[1:27:40] do the same thing and and I believe and
[1:27:43] I want to say this even to my own thing
[1:27:47] I I feel like often time we we so much
[1:27:50] spend so much time studying and knowing
[1:27:53] and there's nothing wrong with that but
[1:27:55] I I believe there has to come this
[1:27:57] element of faith in the church that
[1:28:00] would take what we have learned what we
[1:28:02] know about the word of God just Quicken
[1:28:04] it just light fire on it that way we
[1:28:07] walking and knowing that I am connected
[1:28:10] with the supernatural I'm here with the
[1:28:13] ability to call upon the supernatural to
[1:28:15] come and defend my case
[1:28:19] yes outside of that we know we're not
[1:28:22] different from any other denomination
[1:28:24] not different from Catholic and and I
[1:28:26] like that that that that Ryan he he's
[1:28:28] here he said that well I know when I go

[1:28:34] believe him and here I come to you you
[1:28:36] told me he said let me touch you he
[1:28:38] touches him and said on based on what
[1:28:41] you told me I am believing with all my
[1:28:43] heart that it's going to happen he
[1:28:45] walked away now now that's a
[1:28:50] Catholic we need faith we need God to qu
[1:28:54] Quicken us with that true Faith by the
[1:28:57] word of God as we hear it let's not just
[1:28:59] receive it as a knowledge but let's ask
[1:29:01] that the spirit of God will come as we
