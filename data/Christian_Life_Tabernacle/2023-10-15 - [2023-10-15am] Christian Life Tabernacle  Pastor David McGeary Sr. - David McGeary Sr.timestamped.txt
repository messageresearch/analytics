[18:00] commit the service to you that your will
[18:02] would be done that every need would be
[18:04] met as you promised in Jesus name amen
[18:08] you may be
[18:10] seated we're going to turn to Psalm 75
[18:14] this morning and you know this is just
[18:17] a short little Psalm it's a Psalm of
[18:21] Asaf and
[18:23] uh you know as you remember from the
[18:25] scripture Asaf was was one of the
[18:27] ministers
[18:28] in the Tabernacle one of the leaders of
[18:32] worship you know but he was also among
[18:34] other things a
[18:36] prophet it says in 2 Chronicles 29:30 it
[18:39] calls him Asaf The
[18:41] Seer and in 1 Chronicles 252 it speaks
[18:45] of the sons of Asaf under the hands of
[18:48] Asaf which prophesied according to the
[18:52] order of the
[18:53] king you know so I always you know pay
[18:57] close attention attention to the Psalms
[18:59] that Asaf writes knowing that you know
[19:03] he was a prophet and there was an
[19:06] interesting statement that he made in
[19:07] verse one I just want to you know that
[19:09] kind of caught my attention it says unto
[19:12] thee Oh God do we give
[19:14] thanks unto thee do we give
[19:17] thanks for that thy name is near yes thy
[19:21] wondrous Works
[19:24] declare that's the statement that caught
[19:27] my attention
[19:29] for that thy name is near yes thy
[19:32] wondrous Works
[19:35] declare you know the new King James
[19:37] version puts it this way for your
[19:41] wondrous Works declare that your name is
[19:45] near you know we speak about and we sing
[19:49] about the name of the
[19:53] Lord but it should be more than just a
[19:55] casual phrase for
[19:57] us
[19:58] you know it's important that we
[20:01] understand these
[20:03] phrases and not allow them to become
[20:07] common you know the name of the Lord is
[20:09] a significant
[20:12] thing you know the scriptures say that
[20:14] he chooses where he puts his name not
[20:19] us you know it's not a magic spell or a
[20:22] power word that we apply to something
[20:25] that we're doing or saying and you you
[20:28] know suddenly there's
[20:31] power it's important to know the
[20:33] evidence of the name of the
[20:35] Lord you know we often say that where
[20:38] two or three are gathered in his
[20:40] name there he is in the
[20:44] midst that's true that's the
[20:46] word but Psalm 751 says that when his
[20:50] name is
[20:51] near his works not his words declare
[20:57] it that's right you know his Works will
[21:00] be
[21:02] present you know in other words there's
[21:04] an effect of his
[21:07] name you know his name isn't simply
[21:09] applied because we say it his name can
[21:13] be applied because his works are
[21:19] present you know it says where two or
[21:21] three are gathered in his name he is
[21:23] near it means his wondrous Works will
[21:26] declare it
[21:29] where his name is his work is being
[21:33] performed Jesus said that the works that
[21:36] I do shall ye do
[21:40] also Jesus taught that works fruits are
[21:47] identification ye shall know them by
[21:49] their
[21:51] fruits you know when the Jews did not
[21:54] believe the
[21:57] identity his identity when he provided
[21:59] his name he said in John 10:30 that I
[22:02] and the father are
[22:05] one he told the Jews in John 10:37 if I
[22:09] do not the works of my
[22:12] father believe me
[22:14] not but if I do the wondrous
[22:19] works though ye believe not
[22:22] me believe the
[22:24] works that ye may know and believe that
[22:27] the father is in
[22:28] me and I in
[22:31] him so when they did not believe his
[22:34] claim that he had come in his father's
[22:37] name he told them to examine the
[22:41] works because they were
[22:43] evidence of that
[22:46] name he told his disciples in John 14:11
[22:49] believe me that I am in the father and
[22:53] the father in me or else believe me for
[22:56] the very Works sake
[22:59] he told the Jews in John 5:17 my father
[23:03] worketh hither to and I
[23:07] work they were performing the same
[23:13] works the evidence of the name of the
[23:17] Lord is is that the works of the Lord
[23:20] are being performed
[23:23] yes you can't have one without the other
[23:29] so what are his wondrous
[23:33] Works remember when John the Baptist and
[23:36] John 1 he saw him and he declared his
[23:39] identity the name is an identity he
[23:41] declared his
[23:43] name he said and I saw and bear record
[23:47] that this is the Son of
[23:49] God you know and a son carries the name
[23:51] of the
[23:54] father and John declared his name this
[23:56] is the Son of God but but then just a
[23:59] year or two later he finds himself in a
[24:02] prison
[24:03] cell and he begins to question whether
[24:07] that was really
[24:09] true and he sent a couple of his
[24:12] disciples to
[24:13] Jesus to inquire
[24:17] whether he was still the son that that
[24:20] name was still
[24:22] present and what was the evidence that
[24:25] Jesus gave
[24:26] them he said in Matthew 11:4 Jesus
[24:29] answered and said unto them go and show
[24:32] John again those things which you do
[24:36] hear and
[24:38] see the blind receive their
[24:42] sight and the lame
[24:44] walk the lepers are
[24:46] cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are
[24:50] raised up and the poor have the gospel
[24:54] preached unto them the works of God
[24:59] you know and we have a tendency to
[25:02] become fixed on the physical
[25:04] manifestations of these things and he
[25:07] does do
[25:08] that blind can be healed those that
[25:12] cannot hear are
[25:15] healed but how many times do we step
[25:18] over or
[25:20] ignore how much that work is happening
[25:23] all around us because those who could
[25:26] not see can now
[25:29] see those who had no ear to hear can now
[25:34] hear those who were stumbling around in
[25:37] darkness and could find no way to walk
[25:40] were given a light for their path and
[25:42] steps and guidance to
[25:44] walk those who were lost in the Valley
[25:46] of the shadow of death have been called
[25:49] into newness of Life The Works of
[25:54] God only he can do those things
[26:00] you know his name is near when his
[26:02] wondrous works are being performed
[26:05] that's right you know the question is if
[26:09] we
[26:10] identify with his
[26:12] name whether it's a church service or
[26:15] our daily
[26:16] walk are his wondrous Works
[26:21] present this his name declared by my
[26:25] lips but his works
[26:28] are not
[26:30] found you know remember the Jews came to
[26:32] Jesus in John
[26:34] 6:28 and asked him what shall we do that
[26:38] we might work the works of
[26:42] God he told them in verse 29 this is the
[26:45] work of God that ye believe on him whom
[26:49] he ha sent that's right and then for the
[26:52] next few verses they go back and forth
[26:53] trying to understand how they can be
[26:55] participants in the work of God
[26:59] and finally he settles on verse 40 and
[27:01] says and this is the will of him that
[27:02] sent
[27:04] me that everyone which seeth the son who
[27:08] is his
[27:09] name and believeth on him may have
[27:12] everlasting
[27:14] life and I will raise him up at the last
[27:19] day the work of the father is to impart
[27:23] life to the effect of that name
[27:28] is the eye
[27:29] opening ear
[27:31] opening walk
[27:33] straightening life cleansing lifegiving
[27:38] work of God when his name is present so
[27:43] also is his work amen you know brother
[27:46] brandham spoke of the Believers writing
[27:48] another book of Acts that's right amen
[27:51] there's a reason it's called acts and
[27:53] not
[27:54] words his name is near when when his
[27:58] work is
[28:00] performed I think we can all say that
[28:02] we've been
[28:03] affected by the name of the Lord in some
[28:07] way if your eyes have ever been
[28:10] opened if you have ever been given an
[28:13] ear to
[28:14] hear if you've ever been called out of
[28:16] darkness and into his wonderful
[28:18] life we've been affected by his
[28:22] name but the question is if the name of
[28:25] the Lord is upon us
[28:28] is also his work being performed through
[28:33] us where Jesus said that you also would
[28:37] do the works that I
[28:40] do if we are one of the two or three
[28:44] that are gathered in his
[28:47] name is someone beginning to
[28:50] see is someone beginning to
[28:53] hear is some Life coming out of darkness
[28:56] and into light
[28:58] is somebody's walk beginning to
[29:02] change for that thy name is near thy
[29:05] wondrous Works declare let's go ahead
[29:08] and stand we'll read that short Psalm
[29:11] Psalm 75 this
[29:15] morning you know my prayer is
[29:17] that I don't just have his name but that
[29:21] his works are evident with that name
[29:25] let's go ahead and read that together
[29:26] Psalm 7 75 unto thee Oh God do we give
[29:30] thanks unto thee do we give thanks for
[29:33] that thy name is near thy wondrous Works
[29:36] declare when I shall receive the
[29:38] congregation I will judge uprightly the
[29:41] Earth and all the inhabitants thereof
[29:43] are dissolved I bear up the pillars of
[29:46] it ca I said unto the fools deal not
[29:49] foolishly and to the wicked lift not up
[29:52] the horn lift not up your horn on high
[29:55] speak not with a stiff neck for
[29:58] promotion cometh neither from the East
[30:00] nor from the West nor from the South but
[30:03] God is the judge he putteth down one and
[30:06] Seth up another for in the hand of the
[30:08] Lord there is a cup and the wine is red
[30:11] it is full of mixture and he porth it
[30:13] out of the same but the drgs thereof all
[30:16] the wicked of the Earth shall ring them
[30:18] out and drink them but I will declare
[30:20] forever I will sing praises to the god
[30:23] of Jacob all the horns of the wicked
[30:25] also will I cut off but the horns of the
[30:28] righteous shall be exalted

[57:48] land lord we believe that just across
[57:52] the
[57:53] river
[57:55] just across the balcony of
[57:58] time there's another
[58:02] place that we were meant to
[58:06] live that we were created to live
[58:12] in Lord and we've dropped in this little
[58:15] space of time called
[58:22] life to be tested to be tried to
[58:27] manifest your
[58:30] attributes but father we will return to
[58:33] that eternal life which we've always
[58:36] had we just grant today this morning
[58:40] that you would guide us on our
[58:44] journey you would point the
[58:48] path that we are to
[58:51] travel that you would bring us to the
[58:54] door that
[58:55] that separates this Dimension from the
[58:59] other Lord that we could pass
[59:02] through back to where we come from Back
[59:06] To Where We
[59:08] Belong knowing you father face to
[59:11] face bear with us father in our
[59:15] weakness and our
[59:17] frailties continue to provide us grace
[59:20] and
[59:21] mercy that we might be whole help this
[59:25] morning we pray for we ask it in the
[59:28] blessed and holy name of our Lord Jesus
[59:31] Christ amen amen God bless you thank you
[59:36] musicians thank you everybody for being
[59:38] here this morning let's turn in our
[59:40] bibles if you would
[59:43] to uh the gospel of St John the 10th
[59:53] chapter
[59:59] and I want to read a uh starting with
[1:00:02] the 24th verse this morning it's nice to
[1:00:07] have
[1:00:09] uh Mike and Ellen parks with us this
[1:00:12] morning and any of our other visitors
[1:00:15] God bless you nice to be here where are
[1:00:16] you Mike and Ellen I don't see you there
[1:00:19] you are you're hiding behind Jonathan
[1:00:21] there okay good you know Michael uh is
[1:00:26] was extremely instrumental in us even
[1:00:30] getting this church that we're in now
[1:00:33] and because of that work it's grown to
[1:00:36] where we're building a little something
[1:00:37] a little more comfortable for us next
[1:00:40] store but I've always
[1:00:42] appreciated um what he did for our body
[1:00:47] here and probably it'll never go
[1:00:50] recognized but it was done in such a
[1:00:52] subtle beautiful way that you knew it
[1:00:55] was the Lord able to work us through and
[1:00:59] guide us through the financing and and
[1:01:02] everything just fell into place and and
[1:01:04] so we are where we are today we're all
[1:01:08] where we are today because of somebody
[1:01:11] else somebody helped us along the way
[1:01:15] and always remember to hold that person
[1:01:18] in a great respect because it makes the
[1:01:22] difference it's the people that forget
[1:01:24] for forget how they got to where they
[1:01:26] are and they become
[1:01:29] unappreciative those people will never
[1:01:32] have any character
[1:01:35] whatsoever and you know the only thing
[1:01:37] you're going to take with
[1:01:39] you you know what that is right it's
[1:01:42] your
[1:01:43] character amen everything else dissolves
[1:01:46] but who that you are let's read these
[1:01:49] scriptures this morning it
[1:01:52] says and uh
[1:01:57] he says the then the the
[1:02:00] Jews around about him the Jews
[1:02:05] around then came the
[1:02:08] Jews around about him and said unto him
[1:02:13] how long Dost thou make us to doubt if
[1:02:18] thou be the Christ tell us plainly amen
[1:02:25] amen I
[1:02:27] mean what can you
[1:02:29] say you know it's like somebody looking
[1:02:32] at the prophet of God is saying if if
[1:02:34] thou be a prophet tell us
[1:02:36] plainly you know oh you are such and
[1:02:39] such you are such and set that person
[1:02:41] back there you you know but anyway that
[1:02:44] that's a whole another inspiration in
[1:02:47] itself and Jesus answered them I told
[1:02:51] you and you believe not
[1:02:55] The
[1:02:56] Works that I do in my father's name they
[1:03:01] bear witness of
[1:03:04] me but ye believe not because ye are not
[1:03:10] of my
[1:03:11] sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear
[1:03:17] my voice and I know them and they follow
[1:03:21] me amen and I give un to them eternal
[1:03:25] life and they shall never perish neither
[1:03:30] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:03:35] my Father which gave them me is greater
[1:03:41] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:03:45] them out of my father's hand and
[1:03:50] I and my father are one Heavenly Father
[1:03:55] we ask you to bless your word to us in
[1:03:56] your precious name we pray amen God
[1:03:59] bless you you may be
[1:04:03] seated beautiful scriptures amen um uh
[1:04:08] next weekend uh Saturday Saturday
[1:04:11] October 21st we're having an Outreach
[1:04:14] service here at the church at at 6: pm.

[1:04:33] where we give us an opportunity to
[1:04:34] invite people to church and that'll be
[1:04:38] uh Saturday uh brother Bryce Collins
[1:04:41] will be preaching for us and uh and then
[1:04:45] we'll have service Sunday morning at uh
[1:04:49] uh uh
[1:04:52] 10:00 uh so uh
[1:04:54] look forward to that next uh weekend
[1:04:58] amen so we want to do
[1:05:01] that certainly
[1:05:05] um tremendous times that we're living in
[1:05:08] wouldn't you
[1:05:09] say and uh the other day I I was
[1:05:12] fellowshipping uh brother Tim Siler
[1:05:15] called me
[1:05:17] and and was talking about a friend of
[1:05:21] mine uh David Morris who uh they found a
[1:05:25] br a mass on his brain and he was
[1:05:29] letting me keep him in prayer and he
[1:05:30] mentioned to me a tape that and called
[1:05:35] the countdown and my heart was drawn
[1:05:39] from it and and I was thinking quite a
[1:05:42] bit down the long lines of birth pains
[1:05:47] and and how a woman's in tvil and how
[1:05:50] we're in tvil and then I went and
[1:05:52] listened to the countdown um and it's a
[1:05:56] if I could say that it's a parallel
[1:05:59] sermon and it's it's trying to get the
[1:06:02] people to be able
[1:06:05] to recognize the events that are around
[1:06:09] them to recognize the day and its
[1:06:12] message to recognize the time that
[1:06:16] you're in and what's transpiring around
[1:06:20] you and things are trans trans spiring
[1:06:24] around us that are changing the
[1:06:27] atmosphere that we're living
[1:06:30] in and the doors are closing in on us
[1:06:34] and people's attitudes towards
[1:06:38] Christianity and to church are changing
[1:06:42] the the the way that they feel about uh
[1:06:47] the Lord and the things of the Lord have
[1:06:50] changed it's no longer important eternal
[1:06:53] life isn't important it's not something
[1:06:56] that's valued and when something is
[1:06:59] devalued then to it becomes useless and
[1:07:04] the word of God is useless to so many
[1:07:08] people today because the word of God
[1:07:11] doesn't help you stay here in this world
[1:07:15] it helps you to leave this world and
[1:07:18] that's what we're interested in doing
[1:07:21] we're interested in leaving the world
[1:07:25] and we know that this week and and uh
[1:07:30] I'm sure you're a breast of the news
[1:07:32] that there was a great conflict in
[1:07:35] Israel and there was a a great if I
[1:07:38] could say this a great uh
[1:07:41] War has broke out to the fact that they
[1:07:44] declared war and um and I I don't want
[1:07:49] to go into all those events of that but
[1:07:53] I do believe believe that we should pray
[1:07:57] for those people and uh it's uh it's a
[1:08:02] situation that has come about from uh
[1:08:08] thousands of years ago of man's
[1:08:11] decisions and they're paying the prices
[1:08:14] today and and they're arguing over the
[1:08:18] land and and you've got a people that
[1:08:22] according to the word of God we know of
[1:08:24] the great Holocaust when when uh Hitler
[1:08:28] and those angels that were that came
[1:08:32] those spirits of Destruction and they
[1:08:35] came and they begin to Massacre the Jews
[1:08:39] I believe it was 6 million I believe 6
[1:08:42] million
[1:08:43] Jews they killed and they resolved in
[1:08:47] their heart right then that they were
[1:08:50] going to return back to the land that
[1:08:52] God gave them
[1:08:54] they went back to their prophets they
[1:08:56] opened the Old Testament they read their
[1:08:59] borders they read what was promised to
[1:09:02] them and they determined in their heart
[1:09:04] we're not going to let
[1:09:07] mankind extinguish us from the face of
[1:09:11] the Earth and they went back there and
[1:09:15] they went to that land and they went in
[1:09:18] there and they drove the inhabitants of
[1:09:21] that land back out that they could take
[1:09:24] possession of the land that they
[1:09:27] believed that go God had gave
[1:09:30] them
[1:09:32] and and because it was self-preservation
[1:09:37] to them they knew if they didn't return
[1:09:41] back to their home and back to the
[1:09:44] promises that God gave them back to the
[1:09:48] protection that they received under the
[1:09:51] promises of the scriptures that they
[1:09:54] would not survive as a people that's
[1:09:58] right and now they displaced
[1:10:03] people and and those
[1:10:06] people uh uh were driven out of the land
[1:10:11] and they were driven to different
[1:10:14] places they became
[1:10:17] enemies of the state of
[1:10:20] Israel and because Israel
[1:10:24] had taken from them what they thought
[1:10:27] was there I can sympathize with both
[1:10:31] sides I I I can't sympathize with
[1:10:36] Bloodshed and and different things that
[1:10:40] take
[1:10:41] place but I thought the prophet of God
[1:10:44] typed it to us he said we came in and
[1:10:46] took a lamb and displac the people and
[1:10:50] here we are and we're Are Spiritual
[1:10:54] people that live in a spiritual land we
[1:10:57] call it freedom of religion we call it
[1:11:00] the ability to worship our Lord the way
[1:11:03] that we choose fit and above all people
[1:11:06] we've been blessed because we've been
[1:11:08] elected and chosen God's opened our eyes
[1:11:12] and and and let us be able to see
[1:11:16] something and recognize that he was
[1:11:19] calling out a
[1:11:21] people and he was separating a people
[1:11:24] out of the land out of religion even out
[1:11:27] of the religious freedom that our
[1:11:29] country granted we came out of that we
[1:11:33] came out of the systems we came out of
[1:11:35] the
[1:11:36] organizations we we came out of the
[1:11:39] politics of it we came out of the money
[1:11:42] of it and we were a people that was
[1:11:44] called into the land of God's
[1:11:48] word and if we don't stay in that word
[1:11:52] we will not survive as a
[1:11:56] people because that's our only place of
[1:11:59] protections under the word of God and
[1:12:02] just as there was a great War this great
[1:12:05] war that broke out and we know the
[1:12:09] natural types the spiritual well we know
[1:12:13] that if there is a war against Natural
[1:12:17] Israel because the hour is at hand then
[1:12:23] we also know there's a spiritual war
[1:12:26] against the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:29] Christ and this this Great War and you
[1:12:34] talk about the war and and we know that
[1:12:37] uh I'll just read this little statement
[1:12:39] because I know that you all know it by
[1:12:42] heart but just to uh give it some if I
[1:12:46] could say that some uh a a little
[1:12:50] validity if I could say that says now
[1:12:55] now the natural all things spiritual all
[1:13:00] happenings and so
[1:13:02] forth uh so
[1:13:06] forth uh type the uh
[1:13:13] Supernatural all the natural is a type
[1:13:17] of the
[1:13:19] spiritual so when we see this great
[1:13:22] natural war going on we know that
[1:13:25] there's a spiritual war going on anytime
[1:13:29] the spiritual and the natural meet
[1:13:31] there's a conflict going on there's
[1:13:34] something that lies ahead for
[1:13:37] Israel like you know can I I I can
[1:13:40] explain to
[1:13:41] you all about the 144,000 I don't
[1:13:45] understand how how everything going to
[1:13:48] come to
[1:13:49] pass and I know we have great
[1:13:51] speculators and and great charts and
[1:13:55] everything uh I know that that's not my
[1:13:59] race to run but I know that that race
[1:14:02] will be run and they will come to the
[1:14:05] revelations that God wants them to come
[1:14:07] to and I believe with all my heart that
[1:14:10] when this uh uh tragedy uh struck those
[1:14:15] people that there's real sincere genuine
[1:14:18] people there that are beginning to call
[1:14:20] out on the
[1:14:22] Lord
[1:14:24] and when you call out unto the Lord God
[1:14:27] answers and I believe there's an answer
[1:14:30] coming to them I believe there's
[1:14:32] Revelations and things that's God's
[1:14:34] going to show I don't know if this is
[1:14:36] the time but I can tell you it's a start
[1:14:40] of the time and so anytime that there's
[1:14:43] a war going on there's also a spiritual
[1:14:46] war going on and I say this canot uh
[1:14:50] it's to our local body here and I okay
[1:14:54] Peter said it think it not strange at
[1:14:56] the fiery darts of the enemy you know
[1:14:59] think it think it not strange at the
[1:15:01] trying of your faith think it not
[1:15:04] strange and I want you to be aware think
[1:15:07] it not strange that things that you
[1:15:10] thought that you had overcome that the
[1:15:13] enemy is now going to start to bring up
[1:15:16] and war against you battles that you
[1:15:19] thought that you put away things that
[1:15:22] you thought were over things that you
[1:15:24] thought were resting at peace all of a
[1:15:27] sudden things are going to rise up
[1:15:30] because those things want to get back
[1:15:32] into the land that they feels
[1:15:35] theirs amen Satan used to dwell in you
[1:15:39] he used to have rule over you he used to
[1:15:43] control your heart your mind the things
[1:15:46] the desires of your heart and when the
[1:15:48] seed of God came out and possessed you
[1:15:52] and pushed those those things back he
[1:15:54] wants to lay claim to them because
[1:15:58] time's running
[1:16:00] out for
[1:16:03] him and and and you're an adversary to
[1:16:06] his kingdom you're the voice against
[1:16:10] what he's trying to do you're the voice
[1:16:13] against the world and the things of the
[1:16:15] world you're the voice against the
[1:16:17] religious system you're the voice
[1:16:20] against the false doctrines the brides
[1:16:22] the voice in the last day she's crying
[1:16:26] out and and and and by her lifestyle by
[1:16:31] the way she dresses the way she conducts
[1:16:33] herself she she's a living
[1:16:39] protest amen that's what we used to be
[1:16:43] we used to be Protestants uhuh we
[1:16:47] protested the the
[1:16:49] air of the supremacy of the nickol Adan
[1:16:54] system over the people we stood against
[1:16:58] that that that's not what we moved under
[1:17:01] we moved under the freedom of the Holy
[1:17:03] Spirit and and if your lives if you're
[1:17:07] living there and you're living under
[1:17:09] that that Grace a and under the
[1:17:13] leadership of the Holy Spirit you you
[1:17:15] don't even mean to do
[1:17:18] it but you walk into a place and and you
[1:17:22] bring the
[1:17:23] the people of the the surroundings under
[1:17:26] conviction without saying a
[1:17:29] word this is spiritual warfare and
[1:17:33] wickedness in high
[1:17:37] places you could just just by being a
[1:17:39] real Spirit-filled Christian you should
[1:17:42] be able to create an atmosphere around
[1:17:44] you of peace and of Love A a
[1:17:48] friendship of of you're not at War
[1:17:52] you're at
[1:17:54] rest so much should that be your nature
[1:17:59] that people inquire of
[1:18:02] you what makes you so happy in the midst
[1:18:05] of the storm what makes you so
[1:18:09] sure of
[1:18:11] yourself H how do you you know why why
[1:18:14] aren't you mad over here the workplace
[1:18:17] all these the bosses treating us bad and
[1:18:20] you show up to work every day and you
[1:18:22] just work hard how come you're not
[1:18:24] arguing with
[1:18:26] everything they should inquire of you so
[1:18:29] you can give them and you should have an
[1:18:31] answer in your
[1:18:34] heart you should have an answer in your
[1:18:36] heart cuz I've come to peace I've got to
[1:18:38] I've got a guide I've got someone that's
[1:18:41] that's leading me and guiding me I've
[1:18:43] come to rest I know where I'm going no
[1:18:46] matter what this what happens in this
[1:18:49] Earth this isn't my home one day I'll be
[1:18:52] resurrect resurrected one day I'm going
[1:18:54] to rise up one one day I'm going home
[1:18:57] and and let me tell you why I'm happy
[1:19:00] because I believe it
[1:19:03] soon soon and very soon I believe it
[1:19:07] with all my heart all the signs are
[1:19:10] pointing to it so if if if you've got a
[1:19:14] people that's getting ready to
[1:19:18] leave and you know because Satan knows
[1:19:23] the word of God if these people
[1:19:27] leave his days are
[1:19:33] numbered you don't think he's going to
[1:19:35] war against you you don't think he's
[1:19:38] going to try to keep you from reaching
[1:19:40] the
[1:19:43] achievement cuz there is an achievement
[1:19:46] for the
[1:19:48] bride there's something that's given to
[1:19:51] us to achieve
[1:19:54] and that's what we're after we're after
[1:19:55] our achievement this morning what's our
[1:19:58] achievement the achievement of the
[1:20:03] bride and so we know that that we're on
[1:20:07] a path to achieve
[1:20:09] something and you know how did you know
[1:20:12] on this great natural typing the
[1:20:14] spiritual how how did they they come in
[1:20:18] well they they
[1:20:21] infiltrated amen amen they said there
[1:20:24] was an intelligence
[1:20:27] breakdown you know people started
[1:20:30] missing the
[1:20:32] signs that's right they became at rest
[1:20:36] they they forgot that there there's
[1:20:38] Satan like a roaring line going about if
[1:20:41] if the person knew the strong man of the
[1:20:43] house knew that the thief was coming
[1:20:46] he'd make
[1:20:49] preparation and so what we're saying is
[1:20:52] is is we know he's coming
[1:20:57] amen I I oh brother McGary preach us all
[1:20:59] delivered I'd love to come this morning
[1:21:02] and preach everybody all
[1:21:05] delivered you understand but if if we we
[1:21:09] know he's going to attack
[1:21:12] us we know he's going to hit us from
[1:21:15] every way he can we know he's going to
[1:21:18] try to Snuff our voice out again this is
[1:21:21] not a time for us to be
[1:21:24] cowards it's a time to light our candles
[1:21:26] and set it on the hillside and stand for
[1:21:29] what we
[1:21:31] believe cuz
[1:21:34] somebody you may not know but your
[1:21:36] written Epistles somebody's reading your
[1:21:39] life you have effect on people that
[1:21:42] nobody else can have effect on God
[1:21:44] placed you where you are for a reason
[1:21:47] for you to make contact he designed your
[1:21:50] life that you might come in contact with
[1:21:52] another seed because Faith cometh Faith
[1:21:56] to Faith hearing to hearing that's how
[1:21:59] the gospel
[1:22:01] spread it's spread by personal
[1:22:05] contact so never
[1:22:08] doubt the importance of your
[1:22:11] life and this great
[1:22:14] infiltration that takes
[1:22:18] place and you've got to be
[1:22:21] aware he he's trying to infiltrate our
[1:22:24] lives that he can set the bomb off
[1:22:28] later and we've talked about these
[1:22:30] things thinking men's filter filtering
[1:22:33] everything out making sure you know what
[1:22:36] I mean pray for Revelation so this
[1:22:41] morning when brother Tim mentioned the
[1:22:44] countdown to me I went and listened into
[1:22:48] 1962 and there it's called countdown
[1:22:53] and there's some tremendous statements
[1:22:55] that are made here so I'd like to play
[1:22:57] 30 minutes of it this
[1:23:00] morning
[1:23:01] and and as brother Rim talks about the
[1:23:05] natural
[1:23:07] progressing he as as man made a
[1:23:11] scientific
[1:23:12] achievement God was making a spiritual
[1:23:18] achievement and he talks about horse and
[1:23:21] buggy he talks about and we're going to
[1:23:23] pick it up kind of further in to the
[1:23:28] message and that uh we might be able to
[1:23:33] grasp 30 minutes a little bit about what
[1:23:37] is happening and there is a countdown
[1:23:41] on this these events that you are seeing
[1:23:46] are part of the prophecies that are for
[1:23:49] told to come to
[1:23:51] pass
[1:23:53] amen you know the world is pressing our
[1:23:57] country
[1:23:58] into coming to some sort of compromise
[1:24:02] on Israel that's right and the our
[1:24:06] messenger told us when the United States
[1:24:08] reject rejects Israel and turns her back
[1:24:11] on Israel she's
[1:24:13] finished so there's little teeny things
[1:24:17] that are holding this whole thing
[1:24:20] together and those things are starting
[1:24:23] to come
[1:24:25] undone if if yeah you you know we're all
[1:24:29] good we're homeschooling now a lot of us
[1:24:31] we found good schools for our kids but
[1:24:34] they're
[1:24:38] coming if it's happening a thousand
[1:24:41] miles away amen don't think it's slowly
[1:24:46] creeping we say we got the great state
[1:24:48] of Texas but there's thousands of people
[1:24:52] with a completely different mindset
[1:24:55] moving in I know when I first moved to
[1:24:57] Texas that we didn't there wasn't a
[1:25:00] store open on
[1:25:03] Sunday you couldn't sell alcohol you
[1:25:06] couldn't sell cigarettes you couldn't
[1:25:08] only restaurants could open after at
[1:25:11] afternoon they call them blue light laws
[1:25:14] I believe it was or blue laws you know
[1:25:16] what I mean they were all laws to
[1:25:19] preserve Sunday
[1:25:23] to keep God in the our lives and God in
[1:25:26] our States now lesie and I drove down
[1:25:29] the road the other day okay and and our
[1:25:32] kids played Little League ball and I'm
[1:25:34] not against that or whatever sport I
[1:25:38] I've never uh I felt that that's a a
[1:25:41] home decision not a Church
[1:25:45] decision and we we didn't have practice
[1:25:48] on Wednesday
[1:25:50] nights or Sundays game games or nothing
[1:25:54] now we would go down the road the other
[1:25:55] day and they're all out there playing
[1:25:56] ball on Sunday
[1:25:58] right why cuz more people don't go to
[1:26:02] church now than go to
[1:26:05] church and he said when they no longer
[1:26:08] wish to retain God in their knowledge
[1:26:12] God gives them over to a reprobate mind
[1:26:15] how far will a reprobate mind go all you
[1:26:18] have to do is look just cross over on
[1:26:22] the west
[1:26:23] coast and see what they're doing with
[1:26:25] their children see what they're teaching
[1:26:28] in school see how they're taking
[1:26:30] children over trying to teach them that
[1:26:33] they can be whatever they want to
[1:26:36] be some
[1:26:39] kid decided he identified as a
[1:26:43] cat so they're making Provisions for him
[1:26:47] so he can
[1:26:50] meow that's
[1:26:52] human
[1:26:54] beings that's human beings that's lost
[1:26:57] their mind so don't think it's not
[1:27:02] coming the countdown's
[1:27:05] on and so we're going to listen to this
[1:27:09] uh 30 minutes and then we'll do I
[1:27:11] figured if I talk 30 minutes play 30
[1:27:13] minutes and talk 15 minutes it would
[1:27:16] only be an
[1:27:21] hour I identify with a different math
[1:27:24] than you
[1:27:26] do as we prepare to read this this is
[1:27:30] paragraph 65 out of the countdown
[1:27:34] 1962 he said but there was a people who
[1:27:37] achieved it that's what we're talking
[1:27:40] this morning about our achievement the
[1:27:42] achievement of the
[1:27:44] Bride but there was a people who
[1:27:46] achieved it
[1:27:48] Hallelujah you see where I'm getting to
[1:27:51] there was was somebody
[1:27:53] know what justification meant in the
[1:27:58] sight of
[1:28:00] God they knew what justification meant
[1:28:05] in the sight of God do you know what
[1:28:08] justification means in the sight of God
[1:28:10] do you know what sanctification means in
[1:28:12] the sight of God do you know what
[1:28:14] restoration of the gifts means in the
[1:28:16] sight of God do you know what the
[1:28:18] elected bride age means in the sight of
[1:28:21] God not in the sight of man but in the
[1:28:24] sight of
[1:28:26] God having peace with God through our
[1:28:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:33] amen there was some of those
[1:28:36] lutherans who were loyal they believed
[1:28:40] it no matter what the Catholic Church
[1:28:42] said they believed God's word and stood
[1:28:46] on it because the messenger of that age
[1:28:50] preached the J shall live by faith and
[1:28:54] they believ in a Justified
[1:29:01] State they were able by grace of God to
[1:29:05] achieve
[1:29:07] justification have peace with God
[1:29:10] through our Lord Jesus
[1:29:13] Christ think if that's
[1:29:17] justification that's horse and buggy
[1:29:20] what is our
[1:29:25] achievement it isn't sitting on a bench
[1:29:28] waiting for the train to
[1:29:31] come now we notice again Along Came the
[1:29:35] Methodist with
[1:29:37] sanctification there was many of those
[1:29:40] methodists was actually
[1:29:43] Sanctified now there's a lot of them
[1:29:45] claim it and know nothing about it the
[1:29:50] Methodist Church taught
[1:29:52] sanctification they said they got down
[1:29:55] and cried out and got back up and said
[1:29:59] glory to God I'm
[1:30:00] Sanctified and they went right on living
[1:30:04] like they always
[1:30:05] did but some of those man and woman
[1:30:09] actually
[1:30:10] Sanctified from the things of the world
[1:30:14] and lived a consecrated set aside life
[1:30:18] why that was the automobile age which
[1:30:22] took in more
[1:30:23] horsepower automobile in the old t-
[1:30:27] model was probably 15 or 20 horsepower
[1:30:31] see and 15 or 20 horse bottled up in a
[1:30:35] little engine like
[1:30:38] sanctification and now listen to this
[1:30:40] when science achieve
[1:30:42] something by by the
[1:30:45] natural God is achieving something by
[1:30:49] the spiritual see some things going on
[1:30:53] all the time then after the
[1:30:59] sanctification age so and then we're
[1:31:02] going to pick up where brother Bram says
[1:31:03] now
[1:31:06] Pentecost how much is happening in the
[1:31:09] scientific age around us so if there's a
[1:31:13] natural achievement there's a spiritual
[1:31:17] achievement and as I said last Wednesday
[1:31:20] if the world is
[1:31:23] decaying and becoming morally corrupt as
[1:31:26] fast as they are we should be growing
[1:31:30] spiritually stronger
[1:31:33] also so we should be going up as fast as
[1:31:36] they're going down that's
[1:31:39] right that's right so we need to
[1:31:43] press to the
[1:31:47] achievement that
[1:31:49] we're pressing to and I'm going to read
[1:31:52] this a little statement you'll hear it a
[1:31:54] second as we prepare to
[1:31:57] play and this is the theme I want you to
[1:32:00] grab a hold of as we listen I or I want
[1:32:04] to grab a hold of you grab a hold of
[1:32:06] what the Lord lays on your heart now why
[1:32:09] did these men do this why did Luther
[1:32:12] find it why did Wesley find it why did
[1:32:16] these others because the material was
[1:32:19] laying here on Earth that could make the
[1:32:22] model
[1:32:24] te4 okay now listen to
[1:32:28] this this is
[1:32:31] 1962 there was
[1:32:33] electricity that could make a car to run
[1:32:38] amen electric cars weren't even
[1:32:41] around the man says things that are
[1:32:45] unbelievable if you have ear to here
[1:32:48] let's just listen to 30 minutes thinking
[1:32:51] on the achievement thinking on the
[1:32:53] progress thinking at the materials here
[1:32:57] the materials here for you to be
[1:33:01] everything that God said this bride
[1:33:04] would be would you listen with me for uh
[1:33:09] uh just 30 minutes I I feel it's
[1:33:12] important if you have any confidence in
[1:33:15] me at all um please uh listen this
[1:33:18] morning God bless
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:25] and then Al come
[1:33:27] Pentecost and as science of the world
[1:33:31] was able to achieve a a automobile motor
[1:33:37] the right brothers that created or made
[1:33:41] manufactured brother the airplane the
[1:33:45] Flying Machine was far above the car on
[1:33:50] the Earth because he tuck to the air now
[1:33:54] the right Brothers through their
[1:33:57] achievement was able to take signs and
[1:34:01] pattern something here on Earth to show
[1:34:04] that there was a great spiritual thing
[1:34:06] fixing to
[1:34:07] happen I when the right Brothers was
[1:34:10] able to achieve to get a man's feet off
[1:34:12] the ground Pentecost fell and tck to the
[1:34:16] air with the
[1:34:18] spirit Hallelujah but the baptism of the
[1:34:21] Holy ghost it tuck to the
[1:34:24] air
[1:34:26] oh got his feet off the ground so he
[1:34:29] just swim around Hallelujah got up in
[1:34:32] the air oh how far he was above the
[1:34:35] horse and buggy how far he was above the
[1:34:38] automobile he was up in the air he was
[1:34:41] knocking and puffing and banging but he
[1:34:43] was
[1:34:45] flying see what man achieves on Earth
[1:34:49] for they made of things which do not
[1:34:52] appear God was able to achieve something
[1:34:55] by a spirit filled people who were
[1:34:58] hungering and thirsting and those that
[1:35:00] would stay with the
[1:35:03] word hallelu now if Wesley had to
[1:35:07] stepped out on the word and got a bad
[1:35:09] name behind him was called a crazy man
[1:35:12] and everything else he'd have never been
[1:35:14] able to
[1:35:15] achieve but Wesley was one of God's
[1:35:19] Great scientists amen Luther was one of
[1:35:22] God's Great scientists they didn't care
[1:35:24] what the churches said what the
[1:35:25] organization said Luther didn't care
[1:35:27] what the Catholics said he believe that
[1:35:29] Just sh live by
[1:35:31] faith Hallelujah and he took God's
[1:35:34] chemicals of the word and put it
[1:35:36] together and the church moved by
[1:35:39] faith he put it together by the blood
[1:35:41] improved it by the blood and the church
[1:35:43] got Sanctified Hallelujah the
[1:35:45] Pentecostals believe that the baptism of
[1:35:47] the Holy Ghost that the promises of you
[1:35:50] your children in them as far off and
[1:35:51] they put the chicles together of the
[1:35:53] word and they moved into the
[1:35:58] air
[1:36:01] Hallelujah they moved out because they
[1:36:05] were able to be able to accomplish such
[1:36:08] now why did these men do this why did
[1:36:12] Luther find it why did Wesley find it
[1:36:16] why did these others because the
[1:36:18] material was laying here on Earth that
[1:36:21] could make a key model
[1:36:23] form there was electricity that could
[1:36:26] make a a car to run there was gasing in
[1:36:29] the earth there was uh pist thingss and
[1:36:33] so forth all the mechanics carbon for
[1:36:35] the generator and everything they had to
[1:36:38] have to create this stuff and notice it
[1:36:40] started a manufactured rather not
[1:36:42] created God the created amen he had it
[1:36:45] laying here but man who believ it in the
[1:36:48] scientific real of the natural Pro into
[1:36:51] it and they wouldn't take no for an
[1:36:54] answer they believed it it was a
[1:36:57] revelation in their heart and they stay
[1:36:59] with
[1:37:00] it until they prove that it
[1:37:03] was that's how that John Wesley proved
[1:37:07] sanctification the material was laying
[1:37:09] here the word of God
[1:37:14] that no matter if the whole church the
[1:37:17] angle and church and all turning down he
[1:37:19] stayed with this conviction amen
[1:37:22] and he proved it and the Pentecostals
[1:37:24] come around and prove because they had
[1:37:27] the material that the Holy Ghost was
[1:37:31] right and they tuck to the
[1:37:34] air did you
[1:37:36] notice one one of those scientific
[1:37:40] achievement accomplished the other one
[1:37:42] complimented the other one it was only a
[1:37:45] higher
[1:37:46] form see the automobile was a higher
[1:37:49] form of trans Transportation than the
[1:37:53] horse and the airplane was a higher form
[1:37:56] of transportation than the automobile
[1:37:58] but they accompanied one another
[1:38:02] horsepower
[1:38:04] amen if that's horsepower what about God
[1:38:08] power what about the Holy oan power holy
[1:38:11] ghost power that can justify you the
[1:38:14] same holy ghost power can sanctify the
[1:38:16] same holy ghost power that sanctifies
[1:38:18] you can fill you with this Pres
[1:38:22] Hallelujah and little science that
[1:38:24] didn't know their ABCs found it w they
[1:38:28] were spiritual
[1:38:30] scientists amen they seen the thing they
[1:38:33] believed it man did it by
[1:38:36] education the natural scientist the
[1:38:38] spiritual scientists done it by
[1:38:40] Revelation one by education the other by
[1:38:44] Revelation oh if we just open up there's
[1:38:47] all kinds of material laying here amen
[1:38:49] that's right
[1:38:54] now we notice how it goes how God was
[1:38:57] able to achieve that in the Pentecostals
[1:39:00] taken to the air how they then was
[1:39:03] restored back to the church healing
[1:39:07] speaking in tongues Revelation gifts of
[1:39:11] the Spirit let Luther know nothing about
[1:39:13] neither did Wesley they never taught it
[1:39:16] they know nothing about it because out
[1:39:18] of their age while what would Henry know
[1:39:21] about an airplane in them days before
[1:39:23] the right Brothers it wouldn't have
[1:39:25] noted and the same thing that the man
[1:39:28] back there driving a horse and buggy 500
[1:39:30] years ago wouldn't know nothing about a
[1:39:31] Hess Carriage only the Bible said it
[1:39:34] would be
[1:39:35] there so they was able to achieve it by
[1:39:39] scientific research and when it happened
[1:39:42] on Earth God represented with a
[1:39:44] achievement by his
[1:39:46] church for things which are do appear
[1:39:49] was made of things that does not
[1:39:51] hereall a reflection of it now now the
[1:39:56] Pentecostal age for the last 50 years
[1:39:59] has sent a Revival around the world with
[1:40:01] all kinds of everything in it and
[1:40:05] they've had healings um sickness being
[1:40:08] healed cripples healed BL had their
[1:40:11] sight restored to them do you think the
[1:40:13] world believe it no sir they didn't
[1:40:16] believe Luther they didn't believe
[1:40:18] Wesson they didn't believe the
[1:40:19] Pentecostal but God took the Bible in
[1:40:23] his research a man who was willing to do
[1:40:26] it took the Bible and proved to it that
[1:40:29] it was
[1:40:30] right amen now we got to remember that
[1:40:34] we got to believe it seeing those things
[1:40:36] were time now we've lived up the
[1:40:39] Pentecostal
[1:40:41] age the Pentecostal age that I Prov it
[1:40:44] over there goes out into the lady of sin
[1:40:46] age amen but now something else has
[1:40:49] happened we got an astronaut
[1:40:56] now John Glenn was our first astronaut
[1:41:00] and we find out that that's so far Bey
[1:41:02] of an airplane airplane can only go as
[1:41:05] far as his pressure and so forth but
[1:41:08] this is by an atomic power a greater
[1:41:10] power that presses him so much higher
[1:41:12] than an airplane airplane even even
[1:41:13] isn't in it right he's been able to do
[1:41:17] that all right now we got an astronaut
[1:41:20] natural age and remember the messenger
[1:41:24] comes at the end of the former messenger
[1:41:27] always we proed that there now we're on
[1:41:31] the astronaut
[1:41:32] line
[1:41:35] amen
[1:41:37] God God has science has been able to
[1:41:40] prove that there's an astronaut that can
[1:41:43] go so far till you couldn't see with
[1:41:45] your natural eyes and if can go where
[1:41:47] there's any pressure there or not he can
[1:41:49] just go on out because in a pressure
[1:41:51] tank and he can go up there and sail
[1:41:53] around and see the world around an
[1:41:56] astronaut oh my what the AIDS of that is
[1:42:00] coming yes sir go beyond any natural
[1:42:04] things at all sweet come
[1:42:06] on what does it
[1:42:08] represent a spiritual age a spiritual
[1:42:12] time the word God's going to have
[1:42:14] spiritual
[1:42:16] astronaut hallelu amen the right now H
[1:42:23] the Eagles of the air that can go beyond
[1:42:25] any other
[1:42:27] ver sail above
[1:42:29] everything spiritual
[1:42:32] astronauts Glory that can take the word
[1:42:34] of God and prove that he's the
[1:42:39] same a spiritual
[1:42:42] astronaut oh my glory that makes me feel
[1:42:46] good even in this age now what a
[1:42:50] wonderful think for a spiritual
[1:42:52] astronaut
[1:42:53] see what is it what did the Natural
[1:42:57] Science do has been able to achieve that
[1:43:01] and God through man who would stay with
[1:43:03] the Bible and say that he's the same
[1:43:06] yesterday day and forever and not afraid
[1:43:08] of the promise regardless of what
[1:43:09] anybody said stay with it
[1:43:12] amen what is it you becoming an
[1:43:16] astronaut that can go so far as Beyond
[1:43:19] denominational think amen not anything
[1:43:22] else the things of the
[1:43:26] church him alone
[1:43:30] youut praise Lord and remember in order
[1:43:34] to get be an astronaut they had to get
[1:43:37] in a tank and they can't control
[1:43:39] themselves it takes a radar power and
[1:43:42] atomic power to lift him out beyond
[1:43:45] space and that is controlled by
[1:43:48] Tower Glory God's spiritual astronauts
[1:43:52] is the
[1:43:54] same they come into a tank into a place
[1:43:57] into a body amen that body is the body
[1:44:00] of
[1:44:02] Christ then it's not them it's not
[1:44:05] wasn't John Glenn was it was the tank
[1:44:08] that he was in it was the machine he
[1:44:10] just sat there he didn't do nothing he
[1:44:13] just had the real pure courage to get up
[1:44:17] there and say it's right because science
[1:44:19] had proved it amen God wants man who can
[1:44:22] come into Christ and believe that he's
[1:44:24] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:44:26] don't take your
[1:44:27] own move out into space controlled by
[1:44:30] the Holy
[1:44:33] Ghost
[1:44:37] astronauts hallelujah how far it is back
[1:44:40] from the old horse and
[1:44:42] bu how far it is even from the
[1:44:44] airplan how far it is from justification
[1:44:47] sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:44:49] there are com the
[1:44:51] Eagles the first they were
[1:44:54] lizards then they become
[1:44:57] chickens then they become
[1:45:00] crows but now they're Eagles no one can
[1:45:04] follow them a eagle is a special bird he
[1:45:08] can go higher than any other bird he's
[1:45:11] prepared to se keep his head level when
[1:45:13] he gets up there and some people jump
[1:45:15] with don't know where they're at they
[1:45:17] get there because he can't see no
[1:45:18] further than what he's jump but there's
[1:45:21] some that can look back and see what's
[1:45:22] going on that's the eagle he can stand
[1:45:26] there till he looks it over and waits
[1:45:28] till he hears a message that tells him
[1:45:30] what to say that's the astronaut of
[1:45:34] God it's followed all the other
[1:45:37] achievements why want it follow this
[1:45:39] achievement astronauts for
[1:45:44] Jesus don't even leave by his own power
[1:45:46] he's fired
[1:45:49] out does is get into it that's all you
[1:45:52] have to do is get into it I don't do the
[1:45:55] shooting and the
[1:45:57] placing it ain't gasoline power no more
[1:46:00] neither some church creep it's God's
[1:46:03] Adam power that pushes to come out of
[1:46:05] space amen hallelujah oh W what is it
[1:46:10] these astronauts they've got the they
[1:46:13] never need just tuck the word
[1:46:14] justification just the word
[1:46:16] sanctification he's got into the whole
[1:46:18] Bible amen amen he's got it all of it
[1:46:22] because that he knows that God is able
[1:46:25] to perform every promise he ever made
[1:46:29] amen he just sits there amen and waits
[1:46:34] oh my the words bound to manifest itself
[1:46:37] amen if you're sick and an astronaut
[1:46:39] just remember get in Christ wait the
[1:46:45] countdown he'll fire the bullet don't
[1:46:47] worry huh been able to achieve it
[1:46:50] because God promised
[1:46:52] him
[1:46:54] now how much greater is the astronaut
[1:46:57] these things now from the old horsepower
[1:47:00] automobile power and um and the uh
[1:47:05] airplane power you see the astronaut
[1:47:08] he's so high that he can see things that
[1:47:11] a man in a horse and buggy couldn't see
[1:47:15] amen he's so high he can see things that
[1:47:17] a man in automobile couldn't see amen
[1:47:20] he's so high that he can see things the
[1:47:22] man find an airplane can can see he's
[1:47:25] done went pum out of
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:35] reason that went beyond any achievement
[1:47:38] man could think of the organization the
[1:47:41] denomination had to be Methodist this
[1:47:44] the on T whatever it he's an astronaut
[1:47:49] say
[1:47:52] amen how thankful I am and remember the
[1:47:56] astronaut is controlled by a radar power
[1:48:00] you seen him bring John Glenn in I look
[1:48:02] down there at Cape ralo and seen that
[1:48:04] great big radar thing you couldn't even
[1:48:06] see him nowhere but you could tell where
[1:48:08] he was by the way that radar was
[1:48:10] pointing that's where he was at see and
[1:48:13] we got a radar to prayer prayer is a
[1:48:16] radar power that directs the astronaut
[1:48:20] ask the father anything in my name I'll
[1:48:22] do it just watch the way the prayer it's
[1:48:25] going you see where he's
[1:48:27] pointing just watch the way the churches
[1:48:30] are praying you can see the way the
[1:48:31] missiles are
[1:48:33] flying you tell it by the way the
[1:48:36] astronauts are traveling by the way the
[1:48:37] church is praying he prays Lord of
[1:48:40] course we don't believe in these things
[1:48:42] uhuh that astronaut's coming down that's
[1:48:45] oh
[1:48:47] brother but when all things are possible
[1:48:51] Lord pour out your spirit upon the
[1:48:53] church and give it what we have need
[1:48:56] pour upon us the Holy Ghost and just
[1:48:58] take us out of every reason and believe
[1:48:59] it that word right when we're standing
[1:49:01] right by watch the screen then begin to
[1:49:03] raise its head like this the astronaut's
[1:49:05] going
[1:49:06] onall way up in there
[1:49:10] wonderful goes beyond any denomination
[1:49:13] goes beyond any Creed I remember
[1:49:16] justification is lotted to a Creed
[1:49:19] that's right you leave justification
[1:49:22] like some more like the Lutheran and any
[1:49:25] of their
[1:49:27] satellites that's what they are
[1:49:30] satellite but the an't off the
[1:49:32] ground you take U sanctification and
[1:49:35] there're satellites say what is the
[1:49:38] satellites to the Lutheran well Church
[1:49:39] of Christ that Bunch there what is the
[1:49:42] satellites to the Wesley to the
[1:49:43] Methodist like a Nazarene Pilgrim
[1:49:46] Holiness their satellites and then the
[1:49:48] Pentecostal and their satellites the
[1:49:50] airplane sure the one that's two in the
[1:49:52] street and for sou all these Four Square
[1:49:54] Church of God all still created a
[1:49:56] denomination but the astronaut breaks
[1:49:58] the sound
[1:50:00] barrier you don't hear nothing oh my
[1:50:04] this goes beyond all of it he's way up
[1:50:05] in there for all things he's living in
[1:50:07] the presence of God
[1:50:10] that'sall he promised it his word says
[1:50:14] that he's the high priest you see that
[1:50:16] great big radar sitting out there moving
[1:50:19] watch him in the meeting you can watch
[1:50:21] when the Holy Spirit comes down in a
[1:50:23] form of a pillar of far I he promise a
[1:50:26] man's not going be sitting there trying
[1:50:27] to reason out with science a real
[1:50:29] believer what is he he's a radar screen
[1:50:33] watch him he begins to point around amen
[1:50:36] amen and it catches that one there that
[1:50:38] asona oh you have cancer you had so and
[1:50:41] so you were so and so from such a place
[1:50:44] the Lord Jesus make you well
[1:50:49] Hall
[1:50:52] astronauts oh my what a church it's to
[1:50:55] be it's
[1:50:57] here the achievement's been proved Bes
[1:50:59] science they shorted out the World's
[1:51:01] Fair we got it amen it's proved every
[1:51:05] word astrona age we're living in see is
[1:51:08] made of things which do not appear see
[1:51:10] it was made of something out of Heaven
[1:51:12] it's God himself you're in that sixth
[1:51:15] Dimension it's the power of God we've
[1:51:18] been in such a place so we have been
[1:51:20] lifted up into that Dimension Beyond
[1:51:23] this thing of going to the grave and
[1:51:24] weeping this thing of putting the crepe
[1:51:26] on the door not and saying goodbye
[1:51:28] forever Hallelujah we done got in the
[1:51:31] astronaut and sailed off out there she
[1:51:33] more that return
[1:51:36] back going to the home beyond the sky
[1:51:40] beyond the reasoning of man how the old
[1:51:42] will be transformed in a moment of TRN
[1:51:45] we shall see him there old man and women
[1:51:47] young again how do you know
[1:51:50] the Bible teaches it and God shot an
[1:51:53] astronaut up in there we know what it's
[1:51:55] all about come back no worry about dying
[1:51:59] dying's nothing sure it's
[1:52:02] living yes sir it's just get your feet
[1:52:04] off the
[1:52:05] ground so he can go oh how wonderful
[1:52:09] he's promised all these things in his
[1:52:11] word or Hebrews 138 said he's the same
[1:52:14] yesterday today and forever the things
[1:52:15] that he was able God could achieve by
[1:52:17] one man who would surrender himself to
[1:52:20] to the word of God because as I said
[1:52:22] last night he always stood with the word
[1:52:25] now you know well astronauts is really
[1:52:28] no new thing what about
[1:52:31] Elijah if he was an astronaut I'd ever
[1:52:34] seen one he went where John Glenn never
[1:52:37] did think about
[1:52:39] going well you know they had one tuck
[1:52:41] off in slow motion one time his name was
[1:52:44] Enoch he just walked on
[1:52:46] him but he was an
[1:52:48] astronaut sure he was pressurized he
[1:52:52] didn't have to be changed nothing no he
[1:52:54] was already pressurized when he started
[1:52:56] walking just walked right on out of all
[1:52:57] the dimensions and everything walked out
[1:52:59] in the presence of
[1:53:00] God and so one old fell was tired and
[1:53:03] couldn't walk very good anymore he fuss
[1:53:05] with Jazzy Bell and her short hair and
[1:53:06] paint and everything until God to send a
[1:53:08] charot down let's let you ride up
[1:53:10] through
[1:53:14] the one time one come to die for the
[1:53:17] rest of us and God raised him up on a
[1:53:18] third day and and 500 man stood there
[1:53:21] and see him being taken up into the
[1:53:22] cloud with a voice saying I will come
[1:53:27] again the same Jesus that was taken up
[1:53:30] the master astronaut will return again
[1:53:33] in Black manner in the same kind of a
[1:53:36] apartment that is in a body in marle
[1:53:39] Hallelujah
[1:53:40] glory and we all have a body like his
[1:53:43] own glorious body for we shall see him
[1:53:44] as he is oh Hallelujah he broke all the
[1:53:48] sound barriers all all the reasoning
[1:53:50] barriers went beyond reasoning went
[1:53:52] beyond anything else and any man that
[1:53:53] ever lives for God will have to go
[1:53:55] beyond any five senses it'll have to go
[1:53:57] any education any achievement that man's
[1:53:59] been able to do and believe God take
[1:54:02] everything side to sweep up into the
[1:54:05] heavens
[1:54:06] amen
[1:54:09] oh what astronauts and so forth has been
[1:54:12] achieved in the natural God's been able
[1:54:14] to do it by his church by the spiritual
[1:54:17] by a spiritual people who will believe
[1:54:20] any man or woman who will dare at any
[1:54:22] time anytime to take God at his
[1:54:26] word it's an astronaut they'll say oh
[1:54:29] that isn't reasonable hear those people
[1:54:31] crying shouting hear this oh that's not
[1:54:33] even reasonable that doesn't understand
[1:54:35] somebody told me said you had a dream
[1:54:37] brother brandom when you seen that play
[1:54:38] I never had no dream I was standing up
[1:54:41] there looking down where L on the bed I
[1:54:42] might have been dreaming on the bed but
[1:54:44] I was up here looking down at
[1:54:46] myself oh he just gave me a little
[1:54:48] astronaut ride that morning that's word
[1:54:51] go and it shows that your radar will
[1:54:54] point it out exactly where it's at that

[1:57:55] Christ preach the word stay right with
[1:57:57] the word I don't care what the
[1:57:59] denominations say they're going to

[1:58:04] kick up a big fuss and excommunicate
[1:58:06] them run them out and say they're crazy
[1:58:08] everything like that but they stay right
[1:58:09] with that word as long as God promised
[1:58:10] it they stay there because they're
[1:58:13] astronauts they believe the
[1:58:15] word and there's no way to get rid of
[1:58:18] them they're going to leave you any
[1:58:20] house just just let them alone a while
[1:58:23] but they're in there setting in Heavenly
[1:58:25] places amen in Christ Jesus listening to
[1:58:28] the
[1:58:29] countdown the church ages and so
[1:58:33] forth Glory makes you feel good don't

[1:58:45] where promis this here's where happening
[1:58:47] the achievement he promised today here
[1:58:49] is Right Among Us what are they doing
[1:58:51] listening to the countdown how far has
[1:58:52] it come all the way from
[1:58:55] Luther the
[1:58:57] countdown justification sanctification
[1:59:00] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 wh what are they
[1:59:05] doing waiting for the takeoff the Zero
[1:59:08] Hour
[1:59:10] amen this
[1:59:13] great arbiton that the church is getting
[1:59:16] ready to do and the great time of the
[1:59:21] countdown I'd like to explain to you
[1:59:23] what I think the countdown is I think we
[1:59:27] just been through it in the church
[1:59:29] here and now you notice that when the
[1:59:34] natural astronaut is getting ready to
[1:59:37] leave the Earth there is a countdown
[1:59:41] starting from 10 back to
[1:59:44] zero I haven't tried to break this
[1:59:47] message down and give it his spirit
[1:59:49] spiritual application as it would take
[1:59:51] too much time this morning but I want to
[1:59:56] try to explain this to you that 10 is a
[2:00:01] number of
[2:00:02] worldliness man but seven is the number
[2:00:07] of God's
[2:00:09] Perfection six days he made the heavens
[2:00:12] and earth and the seventh he
[2:00:15] rested and 6,000 years the world is to
[2:00:18] labor against sin or the church labor
[2:00:21] against sin and the seventh is the
[2:00:24] Millennium the
[2:00:26] Sabbath seven is God's perfect number
[2:00:30] and now he has given us the correct
[2:00:35] countdown and his countdown is not 10
[2:00:38] but seven right we've just been through
[2:00:41] it in the seven Church ages now we find
[2:00:45] out and over in Revelations the first
[2:00:47] countdown was the first age the second
[2:00:50] countdown the second age and on to the
[2:00:53] seventh
[2:00:55] countdown and here visible before since
[2:00:57] the pictures drawn that we had this
[2:01:01] Countdown the first number counted was
[2:01:04] Ephesus the second number County was
[2:01:06] Samaria Samaria then pergamus
[2:01:11] thyra fifth was sarus sixth was
[2:01:15] Philadelphia and seventh was the lady o
[2:01:18] the last Church age then it's the uh
[2:01:23] zero time for the church to leave after
[2:01:27] the church ages has served their
[2:01:29] term now we know the fatara age has come
[2:01:34] and gone and the Ephesian age has coming
[2:01:37] gone the Philadelphian age is coming
[2:01:39] gone and we are in the seventh Church
[2:01:42] age at the end of it the lady
[2:01:45] oan age and that is the
[2:01:50] countdown if you Noti in our previous
[2:01:53] lessons of the churches he held in his
[2:01:57] hand Seven Stars which we found to be
[2:02:00] seven Ministers of the seven Church ages
[2:02:04] each one of them is perfectly identified
[2:02:07] as God took his countdown since the time
[2:02:11] he left until the time he comes back
[2:02:14] he's gathering together a people for his
[2:02:17] name sake amen amen started at the day
[2:02:21] of Pentecost the first the Ephesian
[2:02:24] Church the star and messenger of that
[2:02:28] church we believe to be St Paul he has
[2:02:32] come and number one has been counted off
[2:02:35] the second Church age which is Samia was
[2:02:38] irenius the great saint of God who led
[2:02:41] that church age at the end the Third
[2:02:44] Church age which was pergamus was St
[2:02:47] Columbia which was was a great saint of
[2:02:50] God during the time of the Dark Age and
[2:02:53] the persecution the fourth age and the
[2:02:56] fourth count St Martin of taurus the
[2:02:59] great Saint coming from France the fifth
[2:03:03] Church age and its messenger was Martin
[2:03:05] Luther on the countdown the sixth age
[2:03:09] was John Wesley on the countdown now
[2:03:13] we're in the seventh age the lady of sin
[2:03:15] Church age and we are looking for that
[2:03:19] great messenger of the second appearing
[2:03:22] of Elijah on the countdown and as soon
[2:03:26] as that appears then it's zero time and
[2:03:30] the church takes its way home goes out
[2:03:33] into space into the heavens all Beyond
[2:03:36] moon stars everything else and meet
[2:03:39] Jesus where did this come from and where
[2:03:45] did they go into this astronaut
[2:03:49] how did the people get into the
[2:03:52] astronaut at the first place that's the
[2:03:54] way they'll have to get into it in every
[2:03:56] place every time that's right have to
[2:04:00] come in by the same way the first did
[2:04:03] because this great orbit of a great body
[2:04:08] of people there in Noah's time there was
[2:04:11] only one door and that door was the only
[2:04:15] door of entrance everything that come in
[2:04:18] no matter if they went to the first
[2:04:20] floor under justification second floor
[2:04:22] or third floor they all come in at one
[2:04:25] door amen they all come in the same way
[2:04:36] and we can certainly go on but I hope
[2:04:40] that inspired you this morning amen
[2:04:43] about uh it's about achievement and what
[2:04:47] can we achieve
[2:04:49] if and of course you know that was a
[2:04:51] segment that brother brandham came in uh
[2:04:54] there and uh I I think you saw the note
[2:04:58] it says later brother Bram uh put this
[2:05:02] from paragraph 106 through 11 he
[2:05:05] explained it dear in his sermon but what
[2:05:09] is he telling us he's telling us that
[2:05:12] that this is this great
[2:05:15] age that we're living in and it's it's
[2:05:20] there in other words we talk a lot about
[2:05:23] the power of the church we talk about
[2:05:25] you know signs and wonders but he said
[2:05:29] it's there for every believer it's here
[2:05:33] because the materials there well where
[2:05:35] is our
[2:05:37] material we have the message of the hour
[2:05:40] we have all everything in there that we
[2:05:43] need to achieve you know I I like that
[2:05:47] he said they they they achieved to where
[2:05:49] they got scared of themselves don't be a
[2:05:52] scared of
[2:05:54] yourself don't look at yourself and say
[2:05:57] I'm I'm doing this you're not doing it
[2:06:01] it's him in you doing it it's the age
[2:06:04] that you've been created for it's the
[2:06:06] power that God's given you to do
[2:06:09] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[2:06:11] you can ask or think by faith we just
[2:06:14] need to rise up into that great
[2:06:17] astronaut age we need to start taking
[2:06:20] hold of our achievement because we can't
[2:06:23] be
[2:06:24] afraid we can't be afraid to go forward
[2:06:28] we're not going back we're not trying to
[2:06:31] go back and and and eat on a day gone by
[2:06:36] because it was higher than the day
[2:06:40] before you know mean you kind of get
[2:06:43] high he said it takes
[2:06:46] courage for the believer
[2:06:49] to step not out just by uh just by what
[2:06:56] they've experienced amen but to step
[2:06:59] into the
[2:07:00] unknown by the power of the
[2:07:03] promise that's what the astronaut does
[2:07:06] is by the power of the promise that he
[2:07:09] moves by the word of God he sees it in
[2:07:12] the word of God how many in the word of
[2:07:14] God sees an elect
[2:07:17] lady a chosen people am and that and
[2:07:21] that you can lay hold of it and say I'm
[2:07:24] part of that it's given to me I I've
[2:07:28] been called I have a a calling in my
[2:07:32] heart I've been made and created to sail
[2:07:36] into the
[2:07:37] place where I can take the word of God
[2:07:41] not by organization not by Creed but by
[2:07:45] the the promise that was given me by God
[2:07:49] that I can fly into a spiritual
[2:07:52] achievement and be led by the spirit of
[2:07:55] God filled with the Holy Ghost filled
[2:07:59] with the promises of God with the
[2:08:01] ability to achieve the promises of the
[2:08:04] words that were given to me to be an
[2:08:07] overcomer and to
[2:08:10] fly off of this Earth doesn't that make
[2:08:13] you happy amen if the musicians would
[2:08:17] come this morning uh I I I just en I I
[2:08:22] just enjoyed that this morning amen how
[2:08:25] that the believer can achieve how they
[2:08:28] can achieve it by the word of God how
[2:08:31] that the material is here for us to
[2:08:33] achieve by so can you just ask yourself
[2:08:36] are are are you
[2:08:39] living
[2:08:40] below so somebody had to become
[2:08:44] dissatisfied with riding on that
[2:08:47] horse
[2:08:51] you know they got to finally say Hey you
[2:08:55] know we had people that did they didn't
[2:08:56] want to
[2:08:58] advance they thought the automobile was
[2:09:00] the world and and they they just weren't
[2:09:03] going to ride
[2:09:05] them you know what I mean and and they
[2:09:07] tried to stay where they're
[2:09:09] at and they tried to hold the spirit of
[2:09:13] of of
[2:09:15] sanctification but God's pulling us
[2:09:18] beyond
[2:09:19] that he's pulling you beyond your own
[2:09:23] reasoning he's pulling you beyond your
[2:09:26] own comfort zone right he's pulling you
[2:09:30] right now he's trying to pull you I'm
[2:09:33] going to sing something a whole lot
[2:09:35] better faster I'm going to say ready to
[2:09:38] leave so you can play soft till we sing
[2:09:41] that but I want to say what I want to
[2:09:44] say Amen there's something in you
[2:09:46] pulling you to hire
[2:09:49] you understand I mean you're driving
[2:09:51] around in an automobile you're flying
[2:09:53] around in an airplane he said that was
[2:09:57] Pentecost up in the air in the spiritual
[2:10:01] Realms working gifts and that's
[2:10:05] great I have nothing against that
[2:10:09] right you know what I mean if if you
[2:10:11] could fly to the moon as an astronaut or
[2:10:16] drive to the Moon
[2:10:19] or take an
[2:10:21] airplane but the airplane won't get you
[2:10:24] there that's
[2:10:27] right
[2:10:28] right it's okay if you want to go back
[2:10:31] and have the restoration of
[2:10:35] gifts any if any of you feel you have
[2:10:37] the gift of tongues
[2:10:40] beautiful the gift of
[2:10:44] Prophecy we're we're for it don't don't
[2:10:46] let anybody tell you
[2:10:48] I just want it to be
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:53] real I want it to come with
[2:10:57] interpretation I want it to come with a
[2:10:59] message not just edification if you got
[2:11:02] spiritual gifts and you want to meet let
[2:11:05] me know we'll set aside a
[2:11:07] time before the
[2:11:10] [Music]
[2:11:11] preaching but I'm just trying to tell
[2:11:13] you that that plane won't make
[2:11:17] it
[2:11:20] it's going to take something
[2:11:23] more more than
[2:11:26] that it's going to take something that's
[2:11:29] so individually alive in
[2:11:33] you that you actually within your heart
[2:11:37] understand and know that you can step
[2:11:39] from this Dimension into that other
[2:11:42] world you believe so much in the Rapture
[2:11:46] you believe so much in the the change of
[2:11:48] the church you believe so much in the
[2:11:51] coming of the Lord to that door that's
[2:11:54] been provided cuz they all come through
[2:11:58] one
[2:12:00] door every single one of them came to
[2:12:03] the same door now you've got to come to
[2:12:05] that place where you know I am
[2:12:10] prepared I am ready
[2:12:14] am to
[2:12:16] leave and if if you're not it's not
[2:12:20] over because you're still here and you
[2:12:24] still got a
[2:12:26] chance and you can start making the
[2:12:29] adjustments to get
[2:12:31] ready you can start preparing yourself
[2:12:34] you can start reaching out for that
[2:12:37] astronaut
[2:12:39] thinking every single one of those guys
[2:12:41] had to leave the thinking of the other
[2:12:44] age behind you can't take this message
[2:12:48] and put on a denominational thinking a a
[2:12:52] Pentecostal thinking a Methodist
[2:12:55] thinking I know people that only thing
[2:12:57] they get out of the message is
[2:12:59] sanctification I sat under it for for
[2:13:02] four years all all I heard about was
[2:13:05] shoes and dresses and hair couldn't wear
[2:13:08] a leather purse you know what I mean
[2:13:10] couldn't couldn't do this couldn't have
[2:13:13] this and and cuz all they all they ever
[2:13:15] got out of the message was
[2:13:17] sanctification
[2:13:19] they couldn't go no
[2:13:21] higher then that there was people that
[2:13:23] could all all they could get out of the
[2:13:25] message was was uh the works that I do
[2:13:29] shall you do
[2:13:31] also and all they wanted to do is
[2:13:34] where's the church's power where where's
[2:13:36] the church's healing where's this
[2:13:38] where's that and that's all you heard it
[2:13:40] was always it was always make you feel
[2:13:43] bad then then offer you Deliverance
[2:13:48] prove that you're a sinner and then
[2:13:50] offer you a chance to the
[2:13:52] altar I'm trying to tell you Church
[2:13:54] there's
[2:13:56] astronauts people that know I come from
[2:14:00] God I go to
[2:14:03] God I am the word seed of God for this
[2:14:07] age I am mature in his word I accept his
[2:14:12] word I know it's true and not true in
[2:14:16] itself but true in me the word is true
[2:14:23] in me the word is in
[2:14:26] me and then you can look at this old
[2:14:29] wretched flesh that you are and from the
[2:14:33] inside say to your flesh oh flesh I'm
[2:14:37] bringing you under
[2:14:38] subjection

[2:14:51] going to let you keep me from flying any
[2:14:54] higher hey amen I have power over you he
[2:14:58] who is in me is greater than he who is

[2:15:04] world and you can start you don't put
[2:15:06] condemnation on yourself you say there's
[2:15:09] a blood that forgiven me of my
[2:15:11] shortcoming there's a grace and mercy
[2:15:14] that's giv me the power to overcome
[2:15:16] because in this age is given to the
[2:15:20] Overcomer to fly out of this age and go
[2:15:24] into a higher
