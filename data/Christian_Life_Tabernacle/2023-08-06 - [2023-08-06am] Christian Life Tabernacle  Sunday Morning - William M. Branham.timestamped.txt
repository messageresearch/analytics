[6:05] we ask for you to speak to each one of
[6:07] us Lord meet every need Lord draw us
[6:10] closer to you we pray in Jesus name amen
[6:16] I'm going to be seated just a minute
[6:21] it's uh I was reading
[6:24] this week and
[6:26] you know as an old man toward
[6:29] the end of his life
[6:32] David wrote a wonderful promise in psalm
[6:35] 37.
[6:37] verse 23 it says the steps of a good man
[6:41] are ordered by the Lord
[6:44] and he delighteth in his way
[6:48] though he fall
[6:50] he shall not be utterly cast down
[6:54] for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand
[6:58] I have been Young
[7:00] and now IM old
[7:03] yet have I not seen the righteous
[7:05] forsaken
[7:06] nor his seed
[7:08] Betty begging bread
[7:10] you know I think there's such a comfort
[7:12] in that promise
[7:15] you know something David was able to
[7:17] share
[7:18] after a lifetime of walking with the
[7:21] Lord
[7:23] but it wasn't always easy
[7:27] you know it wasn't all sunshine and
[7:29] rainbows and great victories
[7:32] you know he had a hard life
[7:35] he had struggles
[7:38] he had battles to fight
[7:40] and some he lost
[7:43] he had very difficult experiences and
[7:47] circumstances to go through
[7:49] but this was his
[7:51] this was his testimony at the end of the
[7:53] journey
[7:55] you know as we look at Psalm 6 this
[7:57] morning
[7:59] you know this is one of those examples
[8:03] where you see David at a spot where he's
[8:06] calling out to the Lord
[8:07] for his assistance in a time of struggle
[8:10] time of great trial and you know as you
[8:13] read it your initial reaction is
[8:16] well this is kind of a bummer
[8:18] wow
[8:20] you know but
[8:22] you know he at the time he wrote this
[8:25] he was under great pressure
[8:28] there was something that was such a
[8:31] burden to him and such a struggle for
[8:33] him that
[8:35] you know he he was crying out to the
[8:37] Lord and what's interesting is we may
[8:39] not know the specific circumstances
[8:41] that he was that he was in
[8:46] but it was one of those things that got
[8:47] him to such a place where he called out
[8:49] in verse one and two began to wonder if
[8:51] the Lord was angry with him
[8:54] or if the Lord was punishing him
[8:57] in some way
[8:59] you know and I suppose at some point in
[9:01] time each of us find ourselves in a spot
[9:03] like that
[9:06] you know much of the chapter is about
[9:08] David crying out to the Lord seeking his
[9:10] relief seeking his deliverance and
[9:14] in an hour
[9:16] where he was in great need
[9:18] but you know it struck me as I read this
[9:21] that it doesn't matter
[9:24] what David's circumstance was
[9:28] yeah it was hard it was a struggle it
[9:30] was pressure but it never tells us what
[9:32] the problem was
[9:35] the detail of his struggle
[9:38] it didn't matter
[9:41] what remained from the circumstance
[9:44] was the word that was spoken
[9:47] as a result of the event
[9:52] you know every circumstance every trial
[9:54] every burden caused some word to come
[9:57] forth out of this son of God
[10:02] and that's what stood not the details of
[10:05] the trial
[10:08] remember David's testimony at the end of
[10:10] The Journey the steps of a good man
[10:13] are ordered by the Lord
[10:16] he delighteth in his way though he fall
[10:21] he will not be utterly cast down
[10:25] the promise of Psalm 37
[10:28] was a result of his experience in psalm
[10:31] 6.
[10:34] you know as job said job by the way was
[10:37] one who God said there was none like him
[10:39] in all the Earth
[10:41] but job said it this way in verse
[10:43] chapter 23 verse 10 but he knoweth the
[10:46] way that I take
[10:49] when he has tried me
[10:51] I shall come forth as gold
[10:54] you know there's a shine there's a sound
[10:58] there's a voice
[11:00] there's a word that comes forth from one
[11:04] as a result of a trial
[11:09] but you know as we read Psalm 6
[11:12] . it occurred to me as I was reading
[11:14] this that the kind of trial the kind of
[11:16] challenge that he was dealing with at
[11:18] that time is not really what you might
[11:20] think it might be
[11:22] you know very often we'll focus on the
[11:25] really big challenges the really big
[11:27] burdens of Life those things that are
[11:29] life-changing those things that are
[11:31] heavy loads and
[11:33] but you know as David was crying out to
[11:35] the Lord he used an interesting
[11:36] expression here in chapter six he used
[11:39] it several times to describe the
[11:41] situation the circumstance he was in
[11:44] in verse 2 heal me for my bones are
[11:48] vexed
[11:50] and in verse 3 my soul is sore vexed
[11:56] but thou O Lord how long
[11:59] he's vexed his bones are vexed his soul
[12:05] is vexed
[12:08] it's not a word that's used all that
[12:10] often in the scriptures it's used a few
[12:11] times but it's used multiple times here
[12:14] in this chapter
[12:16] and I got to thinking that's such an
[12:17] unusual word
[12:19] what does that even mean really
[12:23] you know it comes from a Latin word
[12:24] which means to disturb but if you look
[12:27] it up in the dictionary
[12:29] this is the words that it uses to Define
[12:31] vexed
[12:33] to feel annoyed
[12:35] frustrated
[12:37] or worried
[12:39] especially with trivial matters
[12:43] and I got to thinking about that and
[12:45] trivial matters
[12:48] things that don't matter
[12:52] to be vexed is to be frustrated
[12:55] annoyed worried by the little things
[12:59] that just don't matter
[13:02] the constant demand
[13:05] the constant pressure
[13:07] of having trivial things
[13:10] the things that don't matter pecking
[13:13] away at us day and night
[13:16] the job
[13:18] the bills
[13:20] the news
[13:22] the politics
[13:25] the cost of groceries or gas
[13:29] the car that's in the shop again
[13:32] maybe it's the plumbing leak at the
[13:34] house
[13:37] the expectations of life
[13:40] it just saps away at our strength every
[13:43] day
[13:45] and none of it matters
[13:47] it vexes our bones it vexes our soul
[13:52] you know David speaks of it absolutely
[13:54] wearing him out
[13:57] stuff that isn't important but demands
[14:00] so much from him
[14:02] in verse 6 I am weary with my groaning
[14:06] all the night make I my bed to swim
[14:10] I water my couch with my tears this is
[14:13] interesting verse seven mine eye is
[14:16] consumed because of grief
[14:19] all those trivial things the things that
[14:22] don't matter that build up day after day
[14:24] after day constantly demanding our
[14:27] attention
[14:28] causing our eye to drift away from
[14:31] what's important and spend all our time
[14:33] focusing on the stuff
[14:36] I worked for a man once that said Mike
[14:38] it's just all stuff
[14:40] just stuff it's not important
[14:44] you know but all those things David
[14:46] calls those things his enemies
[14:48] in verse seven all those things that
[14:51] demand his attention
[14:53] that are trivial they mean nothing
[14:57] they're there to frustrate him
[15:00] they're there to wear him out
[15:03] they're there to take his eye his Focus
[15:06] off the main thing
[15:10] to Cloud his vision
[15:14] all those things are designed to get us
[15:17] to respond to their demand whether that
[15:19] we're rather than waiting on God
[15:22] you don't want to get the pressure gets
[15:24] to such a point where you just can't
[15:27] take it anymore brother Brandon preached
[15:29] a sermon several times letting off the
[15:31] pressure
[15:33] where it's just the constant noise of
[15:36] the little things that don't matter that
[15:37] wear us down
[15:40] [Music]
[15:42] you know a lot had a similar problem
[15:44] where his righteous Soul was vexed by
[15:47] the things that he saw and had to deal
[15:49] with every day that same word was used
[15:52] vexed
[15:57] it's that pressure and every bit of it
[15:59] contrary to the word of God
[16:01] but you know as I was reading this
[16:03] chapter you know David finally gets to
[16:05] the place and finds the remedy that we
[16:08] all have to find
[16:10] in verse 9 the Lord hath heard my
[16:13] supplication
[16:15] the Lord will receive my prayer
[16:20] you know as brother Paul preached
[16:22] Wednesday night you know I so enjoyed
[16:25] that
[16:26] if you they weren't here please listen
[16:28] to the recording of that it's it's the
[16:31] remedy
[16:32] for this exhausting stream of
[16:35] demands of life
[16:39] the trivial things that ultimately don't
[16:41] matter
[16:44] you know Solomon said this in Proverbs 3
[16:47] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[16:50] oh
[16:54] having a heart for nothing else just
[16:57] trust in the Lord with all thy heart
[16:59] and lean not unto thine own
[17:02] understanding
[17:04] don't rely on how things appear to you
[17:06] don't try to figure it out
[17:10] in all thy ways
[17:12] in every way
[17:14] acknowledge Him
[17:16] and he shall direct thy paths
[17:21] be not wise and thy own eyes don't think
[17:24] you can figure it out don't even try
[17:28] fear the lord and depart from evil you
[17:32] know what's interesting about that
[17:33] passage in Proverbs 3 is after you go
[17:35] through all that verse 8 says this it's
[17:38] the remedy for vexed bones
[17:40] it shall be held to thy navel and Marrow
[17:43] to thy bones
[17:46] you know so as I was reading that we can
[17:48] go ahead and stand we're going to read
[17:49] this little Psalm together
[17:52] you know I was just reading that as
[17:54] David was expressing his weariness and
[17:56] his desperation from the constant
[17:59] pressure of the little things of life
[18:02] I thought it was a great reminder of
[18:05] don't don't allow ourselves to get
[18:06] caught up in that get frustrated by that
[18:09] get worn down by that
[18:11] look up
[18:13] commit your ways to him
[18:15] seek his face
[18:18] turn unto him don't try to figure it out
[18:20] don't try to respond to the demands it
[18:23] was certainly a helpful reminder to
[18:25] myself
[18:26] let's just read that chapter six
[18:28] together
[18:29] oh Lord rebuke me not in thine anger
[18:33] neither chasten me in thy hot
[18:35] displeasure have mercy upon Me O Lord
[18:38] for I am weak O Lord Heal me for my
[18:41] bones are vexed my soul is also sore
[18:44] vexed but thou O Lord how long return O
[18:48] Lord deliver my soul o save me for thy
[18:52] Mercy's sake for in death there is no
[18:54] remembrance of thee in the grave who
[18:57] shall give thee thanks I am weary with
[18:59] my groaning all the night make I my bed
[19:02] to swim I water my couch with my tears
[19:05] mine eye is consumed because of grief it
[19:08] waxeth old because of mine enemies
[19:10] depart from me all ye workers of
[19:13] iniquity for the Lord hath heard the
[19:15] voice of my weeping the Lord hath heard
[19:18] my supplication the Lord will receive my
[19:21] prayer let all mine enemies be ashamed
[19:24] and sore vexed let them return and be
[19:27] ashamed suddenly amen
[19:31] praise the Lord
[19:33] amen you may have your seats
[19:35] I was just as we were reading that Psalm
[19:37] that song struck my heart I am weak but
[19:39] Thou Art strong
[19:41] I thought maybe we could just sing that
[19:43] because in our weakness he's strong
[19:45] I I so enjoyed that that's what this age
[19:49] is designed to do is tear you down but
[19:51] we've received one that builds us up and
[19:54] when we're weak he is strong let's just
[19:56] sing that um
[20:00] I am weak but Thou Art strong
[20:06] will and Jesus

[50:53] that he would touch them
[50:55] but when is

[51:00] but Jesus called them unto him and said
[51:03] suffer the little children that come
[51:06] unto me and forbid them not
[51:09] for of such is the kingdom of God
[51:13] verily I say unto you whosoever shall

[51:40] [Music]
[51:57] Christ
[51:59] [Music]
[52:09] amen
[52:11] Hallelujah
[52:13] I first met Suzanne in Congo
[52:18] she came to my hotel to introduce
[52:21] herself and
[52:23] it's been a while now
[52:25] at least two children ago
[52:29] I like to tell the story on brother
[52:31] Patrick because it's a tremendous
[52:33] testimony
[52:35] brother Patrick was working at a certain
[52:38] place I don't remember the job exactly
[52:41] but
[52:43] uh
[52:44] uh he was working there and his life was
[52:48] just crumbling around him
[52:50] and he was working next to a person that
[52:54] used to follow the message and used to
[52:58] be in in church but they had backslid
[53:02] and they were on the work and it just
[53:04] happened to be on the same job that
[53:06] Patrick was on
[53:08] so Patrick said looked over at him and
[53:11] said nah he said I'm just tired of
[53:13] living I think I'm just going to end my
[53:15] life and I can't sleep I haven't slept
[53:19] for days and days and I'm I'm just
[53:22] tormented he said I'm just gonna end in
[53:25] my life
[53:26] and the fella there backslid guy he said
[53:30] oh don't do that he said go see these
[53:32] people they have to have them pray for
[53:35] him
[53:35] and so brother Patrick came over to our
[53:39] house and I believe brother Billy was
[53:41] there interpreting I don't know if you
[53:43] spoke much English then did you
[53:47] know you've come a long way
[53:50] and so he couldn't even speak English
[53:53] and at and we prayed and for him and at
[53:58] peace just and I said well I said I just
[54:00] pray that that you can get some rest and
[54:04] you can sleep in this tormenting spirit
[54:06] will leave you and you'll want to live
[54:09] and so he got and Billy
[54:12] wanted to give him a a book so they got
[54:16] out and built his car and Billy reached
[54:18] down and grabbed a book and it was
[54:20] demonology
[54:21] so he gave it to Patrick and
[54:24] so we prayed for Patrick well a few
[54:27] weeks later I saw Patrick coming up
[54:30] across the parking lot and I said oh
[54:33] Patrick how are you doing he said Oh
[54:36] Brother David I just can't sleep he says
[54:38] I'm listening to these tapes and I don't
[54:40] even want to stop he thinks it's just so
[54:43] wonderful and the Lord really delivered
[54:46] him and now he's giving them a life
[54:48] amen
[54:51] and you know the prophet of God said if
[54:55] God could give you the best thing that
[54:58] he could give you besides salvation was
[55:00] a good wife
[55:02] amen so that's next in line and he gave
[55:06] him salvation now he gave him a good
[55:08] wife and and so we're going to ask the
[55:10] Lord to bless us today so Patrick I'm
[55:15] not going to hold her she looks so
[55:16] pretty but would you hold her up for
[55:18] everybody to see you want me to hold her

[59:17] the first few verses of this scripture
[59:21] here and and then we also want to turn
[59:24] over to a second Timothy the second
[59:28] chapter of the 12th and 13th verse let

[1:00:27] ye know
[1:00:28] and Thomas said unto him Lord we know
[1:00:32] not whether thou goest
[1:00:34] and how can we know the way
[1:00:38] Jesus said unto him I am the way the
[1:00:42] truth the life no man cometh unto me but
[1:00:47] to the father but by me and if he had
[1:00:51] known me you should have known my father
[1:00:53] also and from henceforth ye know him and
[1:00:57] have seen him
[1:01:00] amen I go to prepare a place for you
[1:01:03] let's turn over the second
[1:01:06] Timothy
[1:01:08] here and
[1:01:10] and
[1:01:13] read this great
[1:01:19] a verse that
[1:01:21] is a beautiful verse starting with the
[1:01:24] 11th second Timothy the second chapter
[1:01:27] the 11th verse
[1:01:33] it is a faithful saying
[1:01:35] for if we be dead with him we sh
[1:01:42] shall also live
[1:01:44] with him
[1:01:46] if we suffer
[1:01:48] we shall reign with him
[1:01:51] if we deny him
[1:01:54] he also will deny us if we believe not
[1:01:59] yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny
[1:02:05] himself Heavenly Father we ask you to
[1:02:08] bless your word in your precious name we
[1:02:10] pray amen amen God bless you may be
[1:02:14] seated
[1:02:21] there's no way this morning that uh I
[1:02:25] have the capability
[1:02:28] whatsoever of
[1:02:32] doing any of the sermons that our
[1:02:35] Prophet preached Justice
[1:02:37] but I'd like just today to Fellowship a
[1:02:40] little round uh with you out of this
[1:02:43] sermon things that are to be
[1:02:47] now we touched on Modern events are made
[1:02:50] clear by prophecy
[1:02:52] and and we understood in in doing so and
[1:02:57] talking about those things we we talked
[1:03:01] about the way things are now
[1:03:04] and we realize the way things are now is
[1:03:08] because they were prophesied and spoken
[1:03:11] to be this way I I mean it it we
[1:03:14] understand that the battle is in the
[1:03:17] mind and Satan has raged that battle to
[1:03:21] the point that people are absolutely
[1:03:25] losing their mind their thought process
[1:03:28] no longer has any common decency about
[1:03:33] it whatsoever they just don't know how
[1:03:36] to think that
[1:03:38] so much information is coming from them
[1:03:41] so much data and things are coming to
[1:03:44] him that man's mind is just not capable
[1:03:48] of functioning in fact I think man has
[1:03:52] lost so much faith in their own mind
[1:03:56] that they have gone to an artificial
[1:03:59] intelligence
[1:04:01] they would rather trust a machine or or
[1:04:06] some Gathering of some information to
[1:04:09] come up with with something that's not
[1:04:12] even real it in order to uh find some
[1:04:16] sort of Escape it's it's a total uh lack
[1:04:21] of of mental facilities
[1:04:25] and that was prophesied to be here
[1:04:29] that there would be perilous times that
[1:04:33] come that men would be lovers of
[1:04:35] pleasure lovers
[1:04:38] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:04:40] God not wishing even to retain God in
[1:04:45] their thinking
[1:04:47] and because they don't retain God in
[1:04:50] their thinking God gives them over to a
[1:04:54] reprobate mind in other words a mind
[1:04:57] that can only produce reprobation things
[1:05:01] that are are totally uh
[1:05:06] uh just I I don't even know how to say
[1:05:10] it I can't comprehend
[1:05:12] uh what's transpiring
[1:05:17] we know that it said as it was in the
[1:05:21] days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it
[1:05:24] be in the revealing of the son of man
[1:05:27] and can and we right now are in the day
[1:05:31] of the revealing of the son of man you
[1:05:35] say no that was just when the prophet of
[1:05:37] God was here he spoke the word but there
[1:05:40] was a whole people that that hadn't even
[1:05:43] been revealed to yet
[1:05:46] it was spoken and it was manifested and
[1:05:51] Vindicated but now it's being revealed
[1:05:54] to the Sons and Daughters of God and in
[1:05:57] that day that he was revealing himself
[1:06:00] and making his word known and opening
[1:06:04] the Mysteries and feeding his flock with
[1:06:07] the storehouse in that day in that time
[1:06:11] that that would transpire
[1:06:14] that the world would absolutely be given
[1:06:20] to a reprobate mind a Sodom condition in
[1:06:25] the time and we see that condition as
[1:06:28] that Revelation grows in the bride the
[1:06:31] Sodom condition gets worse and worse
[1:06:35] it's just it's just going along that way
[1:06:38] and
[1:06:40] and so we we we recognize uh these
[1:06:46] things and uh so we we see what things
[1:06:50] are and because they've been prophesied
[1:06:53] these modern events have made have been
[1:06:56] made clear by prophecy but but now we're
[1:07:00] not only talking about things that are
[1:07:02] but the things that are to be
[1:07:06] and with that through we want to
[1:07:09] emphasize on because because of what was
[1:07:13] prophesied
[1:07:15] we see what is now so now if we can see
[1:07:19] what's prophesied
[1:07:21] then we can understand what we need and
[1:07:25] what part that we play in that and so
[1:07:28] I'd like us if this morning if I could
[1:07:31] just uh
[1:07:33] make this set so in our heart uh and if
[1:07:38] it's on my heart so much that each of us
[1:07:41] understand
[1:07:43] the the great value of our
[1:07:47] predestination
[1:07:49] who we are and and what's transferring
[1:07:53] and what's going on and recognize the
[1:07:55] day in our message and step up
[1:07:59] to the challenge
[1:08:01] step up to the challenge leave those
[1:08:04] things which are behind behind and press
[1:08:07] for that higher calling this morning
[1:08:10] we want to make the rapture
[1:08:13] Rapture Rapture Rapture it's all about
[1:08:16] the rapture
[1:08:19] so you know we we see this great
[1:08:21] scripture here and in
[1:08:24] them show us the father and and in
[1:08:27] paragraph 22 the prophet of God makes
[1:08:30] this statement he says it was easy for
[1:08:33] those Jews
[1:08:35] who have been taught through generations
[1:08:38] to believe that there was a great
[1:08:41] Supernatural God
[1:08:46] but to think
[1:08:48] that that God had come down and was
[1:08:53] manifesting himself through the person
[1:08:57] of his son Jesus Christ God tabernacled
[1:09:01] in a body of Flesh that was a little too
[1:09:05] much
[1:09:06] for them to understand
[1:09:10] that was then
[1:09:12] but I could say it it's the same thing
[1:09:15] today
[1:09:16] they can't quite
[1:09:18] understand God coming down and
[1:09:22] tabernacling himself in a bride
[1:09:27] God made manifest in flesh that can
[1:09:30] understand the great God
[1:09:33] and they built temples in churches they
[1:09:36] can understand a god afar off they can
[1:09:40] understand a God that that is great and
[1:09:43] powerful but what they can't understand
[1:09:46] is that God taking the form of Flesh and
[1:09:52] especially taking the form of Flesh in
[1:09:57] redeemed Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:02] now if it's hard for a man to understand
[1:10:05] that
[1:10:06] right then you've got to realize it's
[1:10:09] hard for you to understand that
[1:10:13] that's why it gets so important to pray
[1:10:16] for revelation
[1:10:18] that you can understand that this is
[1:10:22] what God wants to do he wants to take
[1:10:25] form in flesh the bride in the
[1:10:27] bridegroom are one
[1:10:30] so that's what man couldn't understand
[1:10:32] they couldn't understand they could
[1:10:34] understand the great God that could do
[1:10:37] all things but they just can't get it
[1:10:40] into their understanding that this great
[1:10:42] God wants to come down and abide in
[1:10:45] flesh if you abide in me and I abide in
[1:10:49] you ask what you will
[1:10:53] Hallelujah father that they may be one
[1:10:56] as We Are One
[1:10:58] think of it this morning
[1:11:02] you look at yourself and you can you you
[1:11:06] look at yourself and you say oh no look
[1:11:09] there's no way that's happening but look
[1:11:12] what we just read he said if we believe
[1:11:15] not yet he abideth faithful because he
[1:11:19] can't deny himself
[1:11:25] so he can't deny
[1:11:28] what he spoke
[1:11:31] what he prophesied he can't deny it in
[1:11:36] others he said he'd have a bride he's
[1:11:38] going to have a bride
[1:11:41] so he can't deny it he will remain
[1:11:44] faithful
[1:11:45] remember he's faithful to his word
[1:11:49] Heaven and Earth will pass away but my
[1:11:52] word will not pass away God is
[1:11:55] determined to bring everything that he's
[1:11:59] spoken to pass
[1:12:02] Paul was a part of that
[1:12:05] and when Paul was out persecuting the
[1:12:07] church at Ken laying Havoc with the
[1:12:10] church and all this and God has had
[1:12:13] already in his mind chosen Paul to be
[1:12:17] that first church age Messenger to bring
[1:12:19] his gospel to the Gentiles he's out
[1:12:22] fighting it total opposite of everything
[1:12:25] and all of a sudden a pill or a fire
[1:12:27] intervenes in his life and he's gets
[1:12:30] smote to the ground blind and he cries
[1:12:33] out Lord who art thou Lord he said I'm
[1:12:36] Jesus whom you're persecuting I'm going
[1:12:40] to show you the things that you have to
[1:12:41] suffer go by the Wake straight and he
[1:12:44] speaks to a prophet and they find them
[1:12:47] why
[1:12:49] God had it in his mind
[1:12:52] he'll do whatever it takes
[1:12:55] don't be not troubled
[1:12:59] Amen in my father's house are many
[1:13:03] mansions I've gone away to prepare a
[1:13:06] place for you
[1:13:08] how Mac so he's going to perform his
[1:13:11] word he can't deny himself he can't deny
[1:13:15] you
[1:13:16] if your name's on the lamb Book of Life
[1:13:19] he put it there you didn't put it there
[1:13:22] you didn't deserve to put it there you
[1:13:25] didn't get there by any other way but by
[1:13:28] predestination all he foreknew he
[1:13:31] preached the predestinated and all he
[1:13:34] predestinated he justified in all he
[1:13:36] justified he Sanctified and all that he
[1:13:39] Sanctified he glorifies
[1:13:42] amen you didn't have anything to do with
[1:13:44] it
[1:13:48] now that's
[1:13:50] good
[1:13:51] if you don't fight it right
[1:13:54] but if you fight it you're in for a real
[1:13:57] a real knock down drag out
[1:14:00] and guess who wins Hallelujah
[1:14:05] amen so we understand these things that
[1:14:08] they could see that that he was a great
[1:14:11] God but they couldn't understand them
[1:14:13] bringing the flesh and that's the same
[1:14:16] battle that we're up against today so so
[1:14:20] just a little watch as we read this this
[1:14:24] next part of that statement
[1:14:27] he said but he said now as you have
[1:14:31] believed in God believe also in me
[1:14:37] for in my father's house are many
[1:14:40] mansions and I go to prepare a place for
[1:14:44] you Jesus life was fixing to end here on
[1:14:49] Earth
[1:14:50] he had showed the people
[1:14:52] and proved to them that he was Jehovah
[1:14:56] manifested in flesh by the great signs
[1:15:00] and wonders and the references of the
[1:15:04] Bible that he had referred to to himself
[1:15:09] and he proved that he was God manifested
[1:15:13] oh I hope you can read into that
[1:15:16] statement for our days
[1:15:19] and he said when you see my life ending
[1:15:23] it's ending for a purpose I am going
[1:15:27] away to prepare a place for you that
[1:15:31] where I am there you may be also
[1:15:35] therefore
[1:15:38] Jesus therefore is telling his disciples
[1:15:41] that this life is not the end
[1:15:46] ended in death
[1:15:52] wow
[1:15:55] now that something to take into
[1:15:57] consideration
[1:15:59] isn't it
[1:16:01] and he wants us to take it into
[1:16:03] consideration
[1:16:05] just follow with me just a little bit
[1:16:07] and I'll try to move as fast as I can
[1:16:11] he says down here in a little bit
[1:16:15] he said
[1:16:17] now but he was telling them that after
[1:16:21] death there is life
[1:16:24] because I go to prepare a place
[1:16:28] that is to receive them shows that there
[1:16:32] that he was speaking to them that there
[1:16:36] was a life
[1:16:38] after this life is ended so he can't go
[1:16:42] to prepare a place for you
[1:16:45] if he's not going to take you there he
[1:16:49] can't deny himself he is the word
[1:16:54] now he told us don't let your hearts be
[1:16:56] troubled
[1:16:57] in my father's house are many mansions I
[1:17:00] go to prepare a place for you
[1:17:05] that where I am you may be also so by
[1:17:09] telling us that
[1:17:11] he's telling us what will be
[1:17:14] well just like we see by the modern
[1:17:18] events made clear by prophecy prophecy
[1:17:21] spoke of where we're at now
[1:17:24] therefore prophecy spoke for where we're
[1:17:27] at now and that has come to pass because
[1:17:30] then walk with him telling what things
[1:17:33] that will be will also come to pass in
[1:17:37] other words God's word can't fail it
[1:17:40] won't return void
[1:17:43] so where we were wanting you to pick up
[1:17:46] this morning and let's follow this
[1:17:48] through because he's really trying to
[1:17:50] get something deep in our heart here and
[1:17:53] I would really trust that each of you
[1:17:55] could maybe if you prayed about it go
[1:17:58] back and and listen to this uh message
[1:18:04] he said
[1:18:09] okay he said and what a consolation that
[1:18:13] ought to give to all of us to know that
[1:18:17] after this life is over there is a life
[1:18:20] that we go into
[1:18:24] what a consolation amen
[1:18:32] he said and as you get older that
[1:18:35] becomes more of a reality to you as you
[1:18:39] begin to see the days of your life drawn
[1:18:42] close
[1:18:43] then it began begins to to you begin to
[1:18:48] pack up closer getting ready for that
[1:18:52] great event it's now it's a continuing
[1:18:56] of this same life in another world
[1:19:00] another place
[1:19:02] Hallelujah as you see that day
[1:19:05] approaching
[1:19:07] you pack up
[1:19:09] and you get closer and you prepared
[1:19:14] but if you keep putting that scene that
[1:19:17] day afar off then you keep putting your
[1:19:20] preparation
[1:19:21] afar off
[1:19:24] you are you always think that uh I've
[1:19:28] got time I've got time I've got time but
[1:19:32] you actually and I can't go into all
[1:19:35] this teaching this morning but just to
[1:19:37] say this to you you are living in a time
[1:19:39] where times no more
[1:19:43] you understand this says quickening time
[1:19:46] the word of God is coming forth and it's
[1:19:49] quickening it's bringing to life the
[1:19:52] seed of God it ain't no great big time
[1:19:54] thing you know what I mean we're at the
[1:19:57] end the last word has been given the
[1:20:00] resurrection word has been given the
[1:20:03] transformation word has been given the
[1:20:06] quickening word has been given and that
[1:20:08] word is now going out performing exactly
[1:20:11] what it was preached to do
[1:20:16] and it's manifesting
[1:20:21] so you can't keep you can't keep pushing
[1:20:24] this down the road in fact he tells us
[1:20:28] he says there'll be many many a young
[1:20:30] person as we heard this morning in our
[1:20:33] prayer request our brother Jay just lost
[1:20:36] his younger brother Jay's not an old man
[1:20:41] many of people have passed away
[1:20:45] I've Had The Misfortune of of of of
[1:20:48] doing funerals for young children
[1:20:53] of course I know where they're gone
[1:20:57] but there's one thing that we're certain
[1:20:59] of
[1:21:00] one thing only
[1:21:03] God's word will come to pass
[1:21:09] he said I've gone away to prepare a
[1:21:11] place for you and I will come again and
[1:21:15] receive you
[1:21:17] and we know we're in that time we know
[1:21:21] that he's come now in our generation
[1:21:23] he's come veiled himself in the ministry
[1:21:26] of the son of man
[1:21:28] which was none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:21:31] Christ veiled in a son of man which
[1:21:35] means a prophet it was him veiled in a
[1:21:39] prophet standing there you would look up
[1:21:41] and see William Branham and yes that
[1:21:44] looked like brother Branham brother
[1:21:46] Branham but what was transforming in
[1:21:48] here what was coming out of him the
[1:21:51] works that he was doing were not the
[1:21:53] works of brother Branham it was the work
[1:21:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ revealing
[1:21:58] himself through the ministry of a son of
[1:22:01] man
[1:22:04] showing
[1:22:07] that he had come back and returned back
[1:22:10] to receive his bride
[1:22:13] that where he is we may be also
[1:22:17] hearing is the love of God made perfect
[1:22:21] that as he is so are we in this world
[1:22:31] we're not in a light situation
[1:22:35] we're in a serious situation
[1:22:38] but praise God God's given us a peace
[1:22:41] that's her path that's understanding and
[1:22:44] he's given us joy unspeakable full of
[1:22:47] Glory to go with us as we make this
[1:22:50] journey
[1:22:52] so we we we understand that we're we're
[1:22:56] here that that that he's done that
[1:22:59] because this was the time that that he's
[1:23:03] chosen
[1:23:04] to reveal himself and to gather his
[1:23:08] bride up and to have an invisible Union
[1:23:11] with her
[1:23:14] that they can be one and that if the
[1:23:17] same spirit that was in Christ Jesus
[1:23:20] dwell in you it will also Quicken your
[1:23:23] mortal body
[1:23:25] so I I don't know
[1:23:28] how long
[1:23:31] things can go on
[1:23:34] I I I I I know now there's a lot of
[1:23:38] things going on in our country
[1:23:41] in this United States of America
[1:23:44] that it's divided and and
[1:23:48] people are there the law they're trying
[1:23:52] to change the law and change things
[1:23:54] where people don't have the freedom to
[1:23:57] speak like they used to have
[1:24:01] they they want to they want to now
[1:24:03] determine that if you say something that
[1:24:06] and it causes a reaction that that can
[1:24:10] be a crime
[1:24:13] believe me they want to take the ability
[1:24:16] for me to stand here and preach that
[1:24:19] that a person that's under the demon
[1:24:22] possession of homosexuality can be
[1:24:26] totally delivered
[1:24:30] by the healing power of God
[1:24:38] we know that people go through stages
[1:24:42] you know but but God matures it
[1:24:46] sometimes we used to come like tomboys
[1:24:49] or something you know you see a little
[1:24:51] girl climb a tree or or or maybe you
[1:24:55] want to swing a baseball bat you don't
[1:24:57] all of a sudden go oh turn her into a
[1:25:00] boy
[1:25:04] you understand God's got a course for
[1:25:06] all those things those things work out
[1:25:12] the word of God Satan's the author of
[1:25:15] confusion when you start hearing gender
[1:25:18] confusion what does that tell you tells
[1:25:21] you there's a devil speaking somewhere
[1:25:27] and you know what sets you free from
[1:25:29] confusion the truth sets you free the
[1:25:33] true gospel
[1:25:38] not every person's the same
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:43] but don't alter God
[1:25:46] who by taking thought can add one cubic
[1:25:50] to their statue
[1:25:54] and now they want to take thought
[1:25:59] I'll tell you that's ignoramicism that
[1:26:02] is the highest level
[1:26:07] but what does that tell you
[1:26:11] it tells you the hour
[1:26:14] of our deliverance is approaching look
[1:26:18] up for your Redemption draws nigh
[1:26:23] this is your great comfort
[1:26:25] our great comfort is not in what things
[1:26:28] are now but our comfort is and what
[1:26:31] things are to be
[1:26:34] that's what we're looking forward to
[1:26:37] it I'm just a pilgrim here I'm just
[1:26:40] traveling through
[1:26:42] I've got no earthly home
[1:26:45] but I've Got a Mansion Over Yonder
[1:26:50] amen so let's just as we read on he says
[1:26:54] he was telling there was life after
[1:26:56] death
[1:26:57] now listen to this as we go through
[1:26:59] talking about God not being able to deny
[1:27:02] himself
[1:27:05] your birth here was pre-planned
[1:27:13] I don't ever think no matter what way
[1:27:18] you came
[1:27:20] or where you came who you came through
[1:27:25] your birth here was pre-planned
[1:27:31] God
[1:27:33] that's the word of God that's right
[1:27:37] that's right I guess you believe that
[1:27:39] every one of you knows that our birth
[1:27:42] was pre-planned did you know that your
[1:27:46] being here never
[1:27:48] originated just as a myth or a thought
[1:27:54] everything was all pre-planned by God
[1:27:57] before the foundation of the world that
[1:28:02] you would be here
[1:28:06] come on okay that's because you have got
[1:28:10] something
[1:28:12] to fulfill
[1:28:13] it
[1:28:15] right he pre-planned it he cannot deny
[1:28:19] himself
[1:28:22] oh and I
[1:28:23] went out this morning
[1:28:25] that we would see the word of God
[1:28:28] plainly and get on board
[1:28:32] quit letting Satan
[1:28:35] divert us to all other options and
[1:28:39] confusions and Roads and and decisions
[1:28:43] that our heart would be set on one pure
[1:28:47] decision I'm going to make the rapture
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:59] thank you
[1:29:04] am I hearing things
[1:29:06] okay I'm okay everybody else is insane
[1:29:10] but he said
[1:29:12] everything was all pre-planned by God
[1:29:15] before the foundation of the world that
[1:29:16] you would be here the infinite god node
[1:29:20] and to to be infinite he had to know
[1:29:23] every flea that would ever
[1:29:26] be on earth and how many times it would
[1:29:30] bat its eye that's infinite see you you
[1:29:34] are little Minds cannot fathom that
[1:29:38] infinite what infinite means the
[1:29:43] infinite God who knows all things
[1:29:45] therefore there's nothing out of cater
[1:29:52] not even in the I thought as our brother
[1:29:55] brought out not even in the challenges
[1:29:57] of your own life what he's what you're
[1:30:00] going through that that's to mature you
[1:30:07] right if you suffer with them you'll
[1:30:10] reign with him
[1:30:14] If you deny him he'll deny you
[1:30:19] but if you are having trouble believing
[1:30:23] he remains faithful
[1:30:26] to you why
[1:30:29] because it's not based on your ability
[1:30:32] to create belief it's based on
[1:30:36] Revelations
[1:30:38] and if you go through a dry time you go
[1:30:41] through a confusion time if you believe
[1:30:43] God he remains faithful and he will give
[1:30:47] you the Revelation to clear up your
[1:30:50] question
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] if you believe in God also believe in me
[1:30:59] stay true
[1:31:01] God speaks in his own time
[1:31:05] he'll take care of it
[1:31:07] he'll throw everything out there you
[1:31:09] don't know why you are where you are but
[1:31:12] he does
[1:31:15] and you have not and you are incapable
[1:31:20] of changing what God has predestinated
[1:31:24] for your life
[1:31:30] even that preacher that decided he was
[1:31:33] just going to give it all up and went
[1:31:35] and got a bunch of things he's going to
[1:31:37] sit down at his church and get hung God
[1:31:40] just took him home
[1:31:44] you can't mess my plan up son
[1:31:46] I'll just take you now
[1:31:49] God knows what's best
[1:31:55] he said if we know the word of God now
[1:31:58] listen to this
[1:32:00] dick is a wonderful statement now when I
[1:32:04] make this statement I I I I I don't want
[1:32:07] us to get into any negativity here
[1:32:11] or any condemnation
[1:32:13] every word of God that's spoken is given
[1:32:18] to you for life
[1:32:22] there is no condemnation
[1:32:25] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[1:32:28] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:32:32] spirit in other words if you look at
[1:32:34] things in the spiritual realm there's no
[1:32:36] condemnation
[1:32:38] but if you look at the flesh the very
[1:32:41] statement I'm going to read which should
[1:32:44] be a burning light in you to throw your
[1:32:47] hands up and say praise God it'll drive
[1:32:50] you down
[1:32:54] but believe
[1:32:56] have faith
[1:32:59] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:33:02] God
[1:33:04] because their Works were not mixed with
[1:33:07] faith it profits them nothing
[1:33:12] but if you believe it
[1:33:15] God's based on faith
[1:33:18] in fact Jesus's Ministry was his own
[1:33:23] faith believing what God's word said
[1:33:26] about him if he can believe what the
[1:33:29] word said about him can't we believe
[1:33:31] what the word said about us
[1:33:36] listen to this if we know the word of
[1:33:40] God
[1:33:41] we know where we're living yeah
[1:33:45] if you don't know where you're living
[1:33:49] the word of God can show it to you
[1:33:54] a lot of people don't know where they're
[1:33:56] living what am I doing where am I at
[1:33:58] what's going on what's what's with my
[1:34:01] life I don't know is this ever going to

[1:34:35] Jesus Christ his Works Through the Ages
[1:34:39] that was up to the Book of Revelation
[1:34:44] and then he promised that it that that
[1:34:49] is to come so all of his
[1:34:55] promises are true God cannot speak any
[1:34:59] word without it being confirmed every
[1:35:02] word that he says has to come to pass
[1:35:05] before the foundation
[1:35:08] of

[1:35:12] these are things we know
[1:35:14] how many knows what's passed

[1:36:06] not only have we seen what's come to
[1:36:08] pass right he says he he says we we know
[1:36:15] let me just read that again he says we
[1:36:17] know the hour we're living in
[1:36:21] do you all know the hour you're living

[1:36:41] and every cell phone is going in the
[1:36:44] basket
[1:36:45] and then you can worry about it later
[1:36:49] okay have the courtesy and the respect
[1:36:53] to God to turn them things off
[1:36:57] and if you can't live without it please

[1:37:22] a deacon come and have you and take you
[1:37:24] outside
[1:37:28] if we can't have enough respect for the
[1:37:30] word of God
[1:37:32] and for the house of God and you think
[1:37:34] we're going to make a rapture
[1:37:38] then we might as well quit playing
[1:37:39] Church
[1:37:45] is that plain enough
[1:37:48] I mean I'll get pushed into a corner
[1:37:51] line yeah I think there's nobody that
[1:37:52] shows more grace
[1:37:56] then I shall
[1:37:58] because I need a ton of it but this
[1:38:01] isn't about this is about his house and
[1:38:04] it's about him
[1:38:06] so let us go on
[1:38:08] he said so we we know the hour we're
[1:38:11] living in we know what lays ahead
[1:38:14] receive what's passed
[1:38:16] why and the Book of God is the
[1:38:19] revelation of Jesus Christ his Works
[1:38:22] Through the Ages right so you've seen
[1:38:25] that
[1:38:27] you've seen what he says the words come
[1:38:30] into pass now let's go on paragraph 31.
[1:38:34] you were all pre-planned by God
[1:38:42] there's a many a day I wish that God
[1:38:45] made me different but he pre-planned me
[1:38:49] to be this way
[1:38:51] all that I went through all the trials
[1:38:54] all the tribulations all those things
[1:38:57] later
[1:38:58] in this message if you go read it
[1:39:00] brother Branham talks about all that he
[1:39:03] had to go through with his father
[1:39:05] drinking and all the bottles and the
[1:39:07] skills he said it made me what I am
[1:39:13] so if you don't want to be nobody else
[1:39:15] nobody can take your place nobody can
[1:39:19] take your place
[1:39:21] amen he cannot deny himself he cannot
[1:39:24] deny you
[1:39:26] of course that's what Satan's always
[1:39:28] been trying to do is try to put some
[1:39:31] mark on you not that he would deny you
[1:39:34] but that you would deny yourself but he
[1:39:37] will can't deny himself
[1:39:39] he says we're all pre-planned nothing
[1:39:42] happens by chance with God he knows all
[1:39:46] about it it's all pre-planned planned
[1:39:49] for many generations back so that you
[1:39:52] could be here tonight did you know that
[1:39:56] planned for many generations back
[1:40:02] get over it already
[1:40:05] he made you the way you are because
[1:40:07] that's the way he wants you to be he
[1:40:09] knew what you would suffer he knew your
[1:40:11] weaknesses he knew all those things he
[1:40:14] died for you he provided Grace for you
[1:40:17] let us just go on
[1:40:20] he said
[1:40:21] he says just think
[1:40:23] you at one time as I'll repeat this
[1:40:26] again you at one time was in your father
[1:40:30] in the gene of your father
[1:40:32] now he didn't know you at that time
[1:40:36] neither did you know him at that time
[1:40:39] but you see then you were put in the
[1:40:41] bedding ground of the womb of mother
[1:40:43] through holy wedlock and then you became
[1:40:46] a person expressed in the image like
[1:40:49] your father then there was Fellowship
[1:40:52] well he's trying to give a carnal
[1:40:57] understanding so you can see that you
[1:41:00] were in God in the beginning
[1:41:03] now he's expressed you we're not going
[1:41:05] to go into a lot of that this morning
[1:41:07] now the only way you can be a son or
[1:41:10] daughter of God is because you have to
[1:41:13] be you have to have eternal life
[1:41:18] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:41:22] and that's God's life
[1:41:24] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:41:29] God there to be a Son of God you had to
[1:41:35] be in him always
[1:41:41] that's what Satan's trying to hide
[1:41:44] that was the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:41:48] that was the mystery of the opening of
[1:41:51] the seals you always were in him he
[1:41:55] cannot deny you
[1:41:58] if he pre-planned you how can he deny
[1:42:02] you how can he deny his own works of his
[1:42:06] own hands
[1:42:09] he can't do it right
[1:42:12] right he can't deny you
[1:42:17] if he that the scripture tells us that
[1:42:20] we are his workmanship in Christ Jesus
[1:42:24] for ordained unto good works that we
[1:42:28] should walk in them so all he's trying
[1:42:31] to do is through the revelation of God's
[1:42:34] word is get you to that position
[1:42:41] God is not against you if God be for you
[1:42:44] who can be against you is this devil out
[1:42:47] here who's trying to Blind us and keep
[1:42:51] us from it he always wants us to be
[1:42:54] struggling with our flesh
[1:42:58] always wants us being conflict always
[1:43:01] wants he never wants us to look over the
[1:43:04] barriers and look up to not what we are
[1:43:07] what's going on here what what things
[1:43:10] are to be and if we can look to the
[1:43:12] things that are to be then we can say
[1:43:15] that's what I am
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:18] amen amen now you've created a healthy
[1:43:22] man
[1:43:23] that you're going to walk into
[1:43:27] the gun now you know where you're
[1:43:29] walking
[1:43:30] what am I walking to I'm going to get to
[1:43:32] it if you can just bear with me
[1:43:34] I'm walking to something
[1:43:39] there's something I've got to be
[1:43:42] now the prophet of God's going to take a
[1:43:44] few moments here and I'm going to try to
[1:43:46] go through it and and do my best
[1:43:49] but I'm glad you have the tape
[1:43:52] to go listen to it yourself because I
[1:43:54] can't do this Justice
[1:43:56] but
[1:43:58] he says
[1:44:01] you had to ask you to be in him always
[1:44:05] the the gene of your life spiritual life
[1:44:08] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:44:13] there ever was even a molecule
[1:44:18] your spiritual life
[1:44:22] and in a moment brother REM is going to
[1:44:24] separate the spiritual life
[1:44:27] from the physical life
[1:44:32] are we okay
[1:44:34] sorry for cheering you out about the
[1:44:35] cell phones
[1:44:38] I can't therefore you he said
[1:44:42] expression
[1:44:45] spiritual life tonight was in God the
[1:44:47] Father before there even was a molecule
[1:44:49] and you are nothing but the
[1:44:52] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:44:56] was in God as a son of God
[1:45:00] the gene of life was already there
[1:45:03] he know it now he put it in you and
[1:45:07] you're the manifestation of that life
[1:45:10] you are not a sinner devil
[1:45:14] struggling to try to become a Christian
[1:45:22] if Satan can hit you in that battle
[1:45:28] if he can get you in that struggle with
[1:45:31] that flesh
[1:45:33] trying to overcome the flesh trying to
[1:45:35] overcome trying to become something you
[1:45:39] can't become what he made you right
[1:45:42] he's the only one that can manifest what
[1:45:46] he made
[1:45:49] and he can't deny the fact that he
[1:45:53] thought it
[1:45:56] and in order not to deny it he spoke it
[1:46:03] in order to vindicate it what he spoke
[1:46:07] came to pass so we can sit there and
[1:46:11] look at the stars the moon the
[1:46:13] everything and say God spoke this I know
[1:46:16] there's a God the gospel is written in
[1:46:19] heaven I know what's going to be because
[1:46:21] he's spoken and he can't deny me if I'm
[1:46:26] a part of him
[1:46:27] Hallelujah
[1:46:30] have faith
[1:46:34] have faith
[1:46:36] believed this morning
[1:46:41] believe you're a daughter of God believe
[1:46:44] you're a Son of God believe what he
[1:46:46] spoke about you
[1:46:48] if you believe not
[1:46:51] he still remains faithful because he
[1:46:54] can't deny himself
[1:46:59] but don't live below your god-giver and
[1:47:02] privilege
[1:47:05] when you recognize that you'll have to
[1:47:08] fight like Jacob did you'll have to
[1:47:11] wrestle with that angel you'll have to
[1:47:13] kick that devil out you'll have to
[1:47:15] possess his Gates you'll have to claim
[1:47:18] your inheritance you'll have to say
[1:47:20] you're out of here
[1:47:22] I've come to fight I'm tired of you
[1:47:26] defeating me
[1:47:31] not by Will
[1:47:33] not by might but my spirit saith the
[1:47:37] Lord
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] that's all he wants to do
[1:47:45] is keep you from laying hold
[1:47:50] what you can actually say in your heart
[1:47:53] I have a mansion
[1:47:57] I've got representations
[1:48:00] my representation is in this word
[1:48:03] because he spoke it I come from God I go
[1:48:08] to God
[1:48:10] and in the meantime Satan me and you are
[1:48:13] going to fight tooth and nail you're
[1:48:15] going to try to take it away from me you
[1:48:18] tempted my Lord Jesus on the mountain
[1:48:20] you argued with him on the mountain you
[1:48:23] fought with him on the mountain he he
[1:48:25] told you to cast yourself down and what
[1:48:28] did he do he defeated them every time
[1:48:30] with the word of God it is written in my
[1:48:35] father's house are many mansions I go to
[1:48:38] prepare a place for you that where you
[1:48:40] are I am you may be also it is written
[1:48:44] and who is it written of it's written of
[1:48:48] me
[1:48:51] yes can you grab that this morning
[1:48:57] I don't care what Satan says I don't
[1:49:00] care how he's battling your mind I don't
[1:49:03] care what you've done
[1:49:07] I don't care if you're having a struggle
[1:49:10] to believe it
[1:49:12] he cannot
[1:49:14] deny he spoke it
[1:49:16] he cannot deny the Book of Life
[1:49:20] he cannot deny the names that he put on
[1:49:23] it
[1:49:27] oh
[1:49:29] Hallelujah
[1:49:33] where's my rest
[1:49:35] where's my peace
[1:49:37] my righteousness is this filthy rags but
[1:49:40] he's my righteousness
[1:49:43] let us just go on
[1:49:46] forgot where I was
[1:49:49] now you're an expression he says a gene
[1:49:53] of life that God as a Son of God now you
[1:49:57] were expressed after his word has come
[1:50:00] to you to light up this age you are
[1:50:03] expressing God's life in you because you
[1:50:07] are a son and daughter of God therefore
[1:50:10] you get what I mean
[1:50:14] you are now made you're setting in this
[1:50:20] church tonight
[1:50:22] because your duty is to express God to
[1:50:27] this nation and this people and this
[1:50:31] neighborhood where you associate
[1:50:38] now let's
[1:50:41] I mean I got a purpose
[1:50:50] I thought I was no I won't go there
[1:50:53] I got to keep myself
[1:50:55] because I won't get through this I'll
[1:50:58] never get through this this is eternal I
[1:51:02] would just want to leave something with
[1:51:03] you that gives you Supernatural hope
[1:51:10] that you'll finally just look at that
[1:51:12] buzzard and say you are a line buzzard
[1:51:22] Wherever You Are
[1:51:26] yes sir
[1:51:28] Wherever You Are
[1:51:30] mentally physically spiritually wherever
[1:51:33] you are God knew that you would be here
[1:51:44] because you have to be one of his genes
[1:51:48] his attributes you had to be
[1:51:56] I don't hear an option here
[1:52:03] instead of saying I'm wondering if it's
[1:52:05] me instead of saying oh I'm I just don't
[1:52:08] I'm not living right
[1:52:10] just take the word and say I believe it
[1:52:15] I don't see it I don't understand it but
[1:52:20] if he said so then that's the way it is
[1:52:23] I had to be
[1:52:27] no matter where I'm at I had to be here
[1:52:30] I had to be in this spot it was all
[1:52:32] pre-planned I'm here for I'm in this
[1:52:34] spot for a purpose
[1:52:37] I don't know what it is I don't
[1:52:39] understand it but
[1:52:42] he knows
[1:52:48] we've got to change her thinking
[1:52:52] we gotta quit thinking like sinners
[1:52:57] trying to become sons of God I'm going
[1:53:00] to say this I hope it makes sense but we
[1:53:04] got to start thinking I'm a Son of God
[1:53:06] in sin
[1:53:09] and I got to get out
[1:53:16] glory to God
[1:53:18] I'm a Son of God that's not doing
[1:53:20] something right I've got to start doing
[1:53:23] right
[1:53:26] but if you will never do anything
[1:53:30] because you weren't part of the
[1:53:33] pre-planning committee
[1:53:41] God never consulted us right
[1:53:44] right which one of you counseled God
[1:53:50] how do you think I would have designed
[1:53:53] myself
[1:53:59] what the heck I would have looked like
[1:54:01] Saul he was a failure
[1:54:03] right all the Giants of the Land of Nod
[1:54:06] they were all failures
[1:54:09] right
[1:54:10] who would have designed himself a little
[1:54:12] Ruddy Shepherd boy
[1:54:15] with no Beauty in them that you would be
[1:54:17] desired
[1:54:26] God knew what he was doing he made you
[1:54:29] every trial every situation you're in he
[1:54:33] knew you would be here
[1:54:39] time to move on
[1:54:42] get over it already quit pouting quit
[1:54:47] feeling sorry for yourself
[1:54:51] why don't we just say no matter what
[1:54:54] state I am I'm going to serve God as our
[1:54:57] brother brought out the brother on the
[1:54:59] ash sheep
[1:55:02] I'm here to worship I'm here to worship
[1:55:06] praise God God's got it in control he
[1:55:10] will not lose me he will not forsake me
[1:55:13] nothing can pluck me out of the palm of
[1:55:15] hands if he's starting to work in me
[1:55:18] he'll finish it in the end I'm in good
[1:55:20] hands he's a good shepherd he'll leave
[1:55:23] the 99 to come after me Hallelujah I'm
[1:55:27] eternally secure in Christ Jesus
[1:55:39] and he goes on
[1:55:43] now if you had you had to be if you ever
[1:55:47] if you've ever got eternal life then you
[1:55:51] always was
[1:55:53] eternal life
[1:55:54] and God before there was a foundation of
[1:55:57] the world nuke that you would be here
[1:56:00] and when the work of the water the
[1:56:04] washing of the water of the word fell
[1:56:06] upon you it what it was expressed in a
[1:56:12] being now you have fellowship with your
[1:56:15] father God
[1:56:18] as you have with your Earthly father see
[1:56:21] your citizens of the Kingdom not
[1:56:24] citizens but your children Sons and
[1:56:28] Daughters of God of the Living God
[1:56:31] if it be that eternal life dwelleth in
[1:56:36] you
[1:56:38] now think of that
[1:56:40] you always had it
[1:56:45] now when are we going to believe that
[1:56:53] here's a messenger telling why because
[1:56:55] not everybody has it
[1:56:58] but I don't compare myself with
[1:57:00] everything buddy
[1:57:01] one thing is because when I hear that
[1:57:04] voice I believe it yes am I ashamed of
[1:57:07] myself yes
[1:57:10] when I listen to this tape and I hope
[1:57:12] you all sit someplace turn off all the
[1:57:15] distractions and really listen to it I
[1:57:19] didn't know how I was ever going to make
[1:57:20] it
[1:57:22] but then he made it for me
[1:57:27] he didn't say I go to prepare a place
[1:57:30] for all them he went to it's just you've
[1:57:33] got to believe church have faith change
[1:57:37] the way you think about yourself believe
[1:57:39] in yourself believe that he can take it
[1:57:42] you've got us you've got lust from me
[1:57:45] you've got
[1:57:46] gaming problems I don't care what
[1:57:49] problems you have he's a deliverer
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:58] amen
[1:58:02] he said
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:09] I I want to go to this little part if
[1:58:13] you'll be with me it says now then if if
[1:58:17] it was Jesus was the fullness of God had
[1:58:20] manifested he was the fullness of the
[1:58:22] godhead bodily therefore when he came to
[1:58:26] the Earth and was manifested in the
[1:58:29] flesh you were here in him then
[1:58:34] [Music]
[1:58:36] have you has that ever really sunk in
[1:58:42] you say okay here I am right now I'm I'm
[1:58:45] into this I'm I'm I got a bad
[1:58:48] relationship coming I've got all this
[1:58:50] stuff you list all your problems you
[1:58:52] Heap them up but the one thing you were
[1:58:54] with him then
[1:58:56] why were you with them then because he
[1:58:59] died
[1:59:04] that the chastisement of your peace was
[1:59:06] upon him and by your stripes
[1:59:09] you are healed
[1:59:18] you were him then because he was the
[1:59:21] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:59:24] the Word was with God
[1:59:26] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:59:28] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the
[1:59:31] Word was made flesh therefore you walked
[1:59:34] with him
[1:59:35] when you were
[1:59:37] when you were here in him
[1:59:43] right
[1:59:45] so if you were in your father yeah
[1:59:49] right yeah yeah and your
[1:59:50] great-grandfather
[1:59:52] okay that's your fleshly being
[1:59:55] then your spiritual being
[1:59:57] had to be in your father yes
[2:00:00] who is your father the word
[2:00:05] so when he was walking then you were in
[2:00:09] him then you were in there
[2:00:12] why because you were the bride that was
[2:00:15] going to be taken out of his size the
[2:00:18] first Adam was going to become a
[2:00:20] quickening spirit who is that
[2:00:25] who is that it's you it's not somebody
[2:00:29] else
[2:00:32] it's you
[2:00:36] it's me
[2:00:37] hallelujah it's me I'm leaving here I'm
[2:00:42] going in Rapture I have another body
[2:00:45] that's been prepared for me I come from
[2:00:48] God I go to God I'm already risen
[2:00:51] because he's risen
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:01:01] he says it here
[2:01:03] he says you were within a man when he
[2:01:06] was on Earth
[2:01:09] when when he was on Earth
[2:01:12] you suffered with him you died with him
[2:01:15] you were buried in him and now you are
[2:01:18] risen with him manifested attributes of
[2:01:22] God sitting in Heavenly places already
[2:01:25] raised resurrected to a new life and
[2:01:29] setting Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[2:01:31] oh that means so much nowadays church
[2:01:35] that means so much to us to see
[2:01:38] ourselves positionally placed in Christ
[2:01:46] do you see yourself you were positioned
[2:01:49] in this age
[2:01:52] amen you were placed in this age
[2:01:56] you didn't stumble upon this message
[2:02:00] God made a way to get this message to
[2:02:03] you
[2:02:05] because what was the message he was
[2:02:07] trying to give you
[2:02:09] get over yourself for a few minutes
[2:02:17] look what I've done
[2:02:19] look what I've planned
[2:02:21] I pre-planned your life so maybe you're
[2:02:24] sitting here you've got all kinds of
[2:02:26] problems you got everything that's all
[2:02:28] fine
[2:02:29] yeah
[2:02:31] we can have the spirit of God through
[2:02:34] the cross of Calvary you can repent of
[2:02:37] that
[2:02:38] right and if you've never been baptized
[2:02:40] you can be baptized in the name of the
[2:02:42] Lord Jesus Christ and receive the Holy
[2:02:44] Ghost but the word of God said if you
[2:02:46] sin and any man that says he hasn't
[2:02:49] sinned is a liar but if you sin and you
[2:02:52] confess your sins he's faithful and just
[2:02:54] to forgive him
[2:02:58] amen
[2:03:00] is it so hard for us to believe he loves
[2:03:03] us
[2:03:09] he loves you
[2:03:12] he loves you so much
[2:03:15] he gave us only begotten son
[2:03:18] to come down here and die for you to pay
[2:03:22] all the praise for your sins that
[2:03:26] nothing could be laid to the charge of
[2:03:28] God's elect because the seed of God
[2:03:32] remaineth in him
[2:03:37] positionally placed
[2:03:41] the revelation
[2:03:43] that you have been positionally placed
[2:03:46] in lady osia
[2:03:50] the most ugly time there's ever been
[2:03:55] the most evil time the most deceitful
[2:03:58] age
[2:04:00] you think he would place you here if he
[2:04:02] wasn't going to provide something to
[2:04:05] take care of you right
[2:04:08] I'm going to fly now fast
[2:04:15] he's not going to leave you
[2:04:18] nor forsake you
[2:04:20] he gave his word
[2:04:29] now listen to look here's our position
[2:04:34] you've been positionally placed now
[2:04:36] listen to your position now if we are
[2:04:40] those attributes of God
[2:04:43] we cannot live by creeds
[2:04:46] we cannot live by denomination we must
[2:04:49] live by the word
[2:04:53] because the bride is part of the
[2:04:57] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[2:05:01] husband therefore we must be that word
[2:05:06] bride
[2:05:08] expected
[2:05:10] and what is the word bride
[2:05:18] the manifestation of this hour
[2:05:22] the bride not a Creed or a denomination
[2:05:26] but a living Oracle of God a living
[2:05:31] attribute of God
[2:05:33] displaying to the world the attributes
[2:05:37] of God
[2:05:39] in the formation of the Bride that's to
[2:05:43] be expressed in this hour that we're in
[2:05:48] now we're now living
[2:05:56] my purpose
[2:06:00] all right now
[2:06:04] let's change gears can I have 30 more
[2:06:07] minutes
[2:06:09] you're really free to leave anytime
[2:06:14] if you find you got flat tires that's
[2:06:16] because we don't want you to leave
[2:06:21] is that right that's our position
[2:06:24] he says nobody else could listen he said
[2:06:27] Martin Luther could not express the
[2:06:29] attributes that were we expressed
[2:06:32] because that that was in the beginning
[2:06:35] the resurrection like the corn of wheat
[2:06:38] that fell underground nobody kind of
[2:06:40] right you have been put here to fulfill
[2:06:43] this purpose
[2:06:46] because you are part of things that are
[2:06:50] to be
[2:06:52] you are prophecy
[2:06:54] manifesting
[2:06:58] he said the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:07:00] in this hour
[2:07:02] not what he was in another hour
[2:07:05] what he was now the Bible expressed it's
[2:07:10] growing
[2:07:11] in the bride the full statue
[2:07:18] it's growing in the bride this is
[2:07:22] growing in you
[2:07:25] do you understand this purpose is
[2:07:28] growing in you
[2:07:31] did you hear him say it it's growing in
[2:07:34] the bride
[2:07:36] it's starting to take hold it's starting
[2:07:39] to grow it's starting to manifest it's
[2:07:43] starting to come to the surface
[2:07:47] you see that right
[2:07:49] he says
[2:07:52] he says therefore the bride in the
[2:07:54] Rapture will come forth
[2:07:58] and there is all pre-planned by God all
[2:08:03] backed up from the beginning he knowed
[2:08:06] every man
[2:08:07] every place
[2:08:09] who would set
[2:08:11] all about it
[2:08:13] that's all pre-plan that's paragraph 37
[2:08:16] sorry
[2:08:18] it's all pre-planned
[2:08:21] God knew it would be here
[2:08:24] he made it that way
[2:08:26] so that when we get there
[2:08:30] he's gone to prepare a place for us when
[2:08:34] we get there it'll be all prepared just
[2:08:38] like even this night was prepared like
[2:08:42] this hour is prepared yes his great
[2:08:45] foreknowledge tells him that all tells
[2:08:50] him all these things by foreknowledge
[2:08:55] amen do you believe that now let's let
[2:08:59] this sink in
[2:09:03] don't look at your present condition
[2:09:08] look at things that are to be
[2:09:11] when you're sick if you look at your
[2:09:14] present condition what do you see
[2:09:18] sick
[2:09:19] but when you look at a well person
[2:09:22] and a healed person when you look at
[2:09:25] what's to be then you confess what's to
[2:09:29] be and God can do nothing for you till
[2:09:32] you confess it first
[2:09:36] so you see what he said I believe what
[2:09:40] he said that this would be I'm sick are
[2:09:42] you sick yeah you're sick
[2:09:45] you've got Panther yeah you can't just I
[2:09:48] don't got cancer I'm not sick that ain't
[2:09:50] faith
[2:09:52] faith is in what he said is going to
[2:09:54] happen
[2:09:57] not confessing what is faith is the
[2:10:01] evidence of things hoped for not yet
[2:10:05] seen
[2:10:09] so you might look in the mirror you
[2:10:11] don't see no perfect person
[2:10:14] right
[2:10:15] but you know what he said about you
[2:10:18] that's what you're believing you start
[2:10:21] confessing that you start confessing
[2:10:23] that to Satan you start playing those
[2:10:26] games and all of a sudden you say wait a
[2:10:28] minute I am not going to spend my life
[2:10:31] this is not a reflection of Jesus Christ
[2:10:33] this is not a reflection of my purpose
[2:10:36] to show my neighbors To Shine the Light
[2:10:39] of the Gospel Satan has got me locked up
[2:10:41] in a room I'm in prison
[2:10:48] you're in prison
[2:10:51] you're in a mental prison
[2:10:53] playing against an artificial
[2:10:55] intelligence
[2:10:58] with a game you can never win
[2:11:03] wake up
[2:11:06] you're not called
[2:11:09] people they're all into the Cowboys
[2:11:11] Cowboys Cowboys America's team so they
[2:11:14] haven't won a playoff game don't matter
[2:11:16] don't matter their Super Bowl they're
[2:11:18] the greatest and they win the Super Bowl
[2:11:21] and then one day it's over
[2:11:23] it's all about next year next year next
[2:11:27] year you know what that is that's
[2:11:29] Forever Learning and never coming to the
[2:11:32] realization of the truth
[2:11:39] I I promised I'd close but I'm so I'm
[2:11:43] just this has got me so much
[2:11:48] he said I don't believe that a person
[2:11:50] just happened to be here by chance
[2:11:54] paragraph 41. now just think when you
[2:11:57] come to this world
[2:11:59] everything had to be
[2:12:02] for prepared for you
[2:12:05] or prepared rather for you I don't
[2:12:09] hardly understand how that we could not
[2:12:12] think a God that could prepare all these
[2:12:16] good things for us
[2:12:17] we could not trust him
[2:12:21] he brought us to this chaos that we're
[2:12:24] in now and prepare the good things of
[2:12:28] life for us here how much more can he
[2:12:31] trust and prepare the things that is to
[2:12:36] come see be Eternal things it seems I
[2:12:39] say very strange
[2:12:42] did you know that God prepared
[2:12:44] everything for you
[2:12:47] just think just think about it God
[2:12:50] prepared you're coming here some of you
[2:12:53] like mountains
[2:12:55] he made mountains some like deserts he
[2:12:59] made deserts some like planes you know
[2:13:02] where you can see for mouth some like
[2:13:04] myself loved the ocean Coast I love the
[2:13:07] ocean he some like winter
[2:13:11] some like summer some like spring some
[2:13:14] like fall all that was prepared because
[2:13:16] he knew you were coming here
[2:13:18] he prepared the air that you breathe he
[2:13:22] prepared the food that you eat
[2:13:25] he prepared everything for you
[2:13:28] when you got here
[2:13:32] you are you are not living by your own
[2:13:36] strength
[2:13:38] you're living by the hand of God
[2:13:44] so you understand that
[2:13:46] and now this is what we're going to
[2:13:49] close with here
[2:13:52] this morning because we want this to set
[2:13:55] in deep
[2:13:57] he says look at your Earthly parents
[2:14:03] before you come here paragraph 44 before
[2:14:07] you come here before they knew you was
[2:14:10] coming
[2:14:11] made ready for your coming
[2:14:16] now he's given a type so you can see
[2:14:18] this
[2:14:19] just think of that now your Earthly
[2:14:23] parents
[2:14:24] which is an Earthly parent is only a
[2:14:28] type of a Heavenly parent
[2:14:33] if we knew how to give good gifts to our
[2:14:37] children
[2:14:38] how much more does our heavenly father
[2:14:41] know how to give good gifts to his
[2:14:44] children Jesus spoke
[2:14:49] they made ready
[2:14:51] you're coming
[2:14:53] they made a little crib and got a little
[2:14:56] some little booties and little clothes
[2:15:00] and so forth they made ready everything
[2:15:03] for you to arrive prepared before you
[2:15:07] even come here
[2:15:09] on Earth
[2:15:12] can you believe that
[2:15:14] now just think of that for a moment
[2:15:18] and he says on here in paragraph 49 but
[2:15:22] the father knew that you would be here
[2:15:25] and prepared everything for you before
[2:15:29] you got here
[2:15:33] right he knew that you were coming
[2:15:35] he prepared everything here for you got
[2:15:38] here he prepared the gospel for you he
[2:15:41] prepared the time of your salvation for
[2:15:43] you he prepared the time of your
[2:15:45] deliverance for you it's all pre-planned
[2:15:48] he knew that when you would get here he
[2:15:50] would have an angel there to protect you
[2:15:52] he knew all those things he prepared
[2:15:55] everything for you before you even got
[2:15:58] here God already made preparations for
[2:16:02] your coming to this earth amen
[2:16:07] God can do
[2:16:09] one thing that God can't do
[2:16:13] is lie
[2:16:21] all about it
[2:16:23] he pre-planned your coming
[2:16:26] the weather the everything your life all
[2:16:30] of its all be pre-planned Generations
[2:16:32] before you got here it's all pre-planned
[2:16:36] you are not out of the plan of God you
[2:16:39] are not struggling to get into the plan
[2:16:42] of God
[2:16:43] we're letting Satan blind us
[2:16:50] we're letting the world and the love of
[2:16:54] the world blind us
[2:16:57] from the things that God has and
[2:17:01] prepared for them that love him
[2:17:05] he's looking at your weaknesses so you
[2:17:08] can't use God's power
[2:17:12] Satan does not want you to rise up
[2:17:19] he does not want you to become that
[2:17:21] Invincible Army
[2:17:24] he's keeping you by looking at yourself
[2:17:30] he's keeping you
[2:17:34] from seeing everything that he said
[2:17:40] man does not live by bread alone but by
[2:17:44] every word of the mouth of God
[2:17:50] he's he's he's he he's he's told so many
[2:17:54] lies
[2:17:55] he's built civilization he's been
[2:17:58] education Abraham didn't believe he was
[2:18:01] going to get that baby by science
[2:18:07] Abraham believed that God said so
[2:18:14] and when Abraham tried to sell his wife
[2:18:16] off as his sister
[2:18:19] God made the king repent
[2:18:26] you're a dead man what do you mean I'm a
[2:18:28] dead man he told me it was his sister
[2:18:32] I was I'm righteous you know I'm good he
[2:18:35] said you go have him pray for you
[2:18:41] figure that one out
[2:18:43] if you can figure that out you can
[2:18:45] figure say you tell me why you're saved
[2:18:48] tell me what you did
[2:18:50] tell me your Works your greatness how
[2:18:53] spiritual you are
[2:19:01] and then he comes right back around says
[2:19:03] you cannot lay anything to the charge of
[2:19:07] my elect
[2:19:13] why
[2:19:14] they had eternal life from the beginning
[2:19:20] he already wiped it clean
[2:19:23] it was all on him
[2:19:30] he said but the father he be and he
[2:19:33] prepared everything for you when you got
[2:19:35] here your first coming here he had ready
[2:19:39] for you when you got here isn't that
[2:19:41] marvelous to think of what he's done
[2:19:45] think of it
[2:19:48] now listen just for a moment
[2:19:51] now think
[2:19:53] paragraph 77.
[2:19:56] now think
[2:19:57] if God in his Mercy
[2:20:00] has a mother
[2:20:02] right and isn't that what a mother does
[2:20:05] before uh you know if if she if if he
[2:20:10] got a little something you know and the
[2:20:13] mother has a craving well why does she
[2:20:16] have that craving
[2:20:19] because the baby inside her needs
[2:20:22] something
[2:20:24] maybe a calcium maybe a vitamin or
[2:20:27] something so when the Earthly mother is
[2:20:30] fixing to prepare that baby and that
[2:20:33] baby's gonna come forth all of a sudden
[2:20:35] that mother has a craving
[2:20:38] you know oh I gotta have ice cream I've
[2:20:41] got to have this I I just just this
[2:20:43] craving for this and that and because
[2:20:46] there's some life
[2:20:48] in her
[2:20:50] that has need of something
[2:20:53] and if that life doesn't get what it has
[2:20:56] need of it won't come out right
[2:21:01] now that's in the natural as a type of
[2:21:04] the spiritual it says now
[2:21:10] now this is paragraph 76. now think how
[2:21:13] that God we should behave ourselves and
[2:21:16] act like Christians our cognit should be
[2:21:19] like Christians because we are aliens
[2:21:22] here
[2:21:23] this is not our home
[2:21:26] we are just put here
[2:21:29] temporarily we've got to go every one of
[2:21:33] us tonight
[2:21:38] oh my
[2:21:41] we gotta leave
[2:21:43] we've got to go
[2:21:48] now if you want to stay
[2:21:55] but I want to go
[2:21:59] now think God in his Mercy
[2:22:02] has a mother before a little baby is
[2:22:05] born is craving for vitamins and the
[2:22:09] mother's word speaks forth dad I want
[2:22:13] cantaloupe or watermelon I want
[2:22:16] something another
[2:22:18] it's out why he'll do everything he can
[2:22:21] to get that because he knows he wants
[2:22:25] his child born as perfect as it can be
[2:22:28] see and he'll do everything that he is
[2:22:33] able to do to get it
[2:22:38] how much more abeler
[2:22:42] is he to get it
[2:22:50] he is a creator
[2:22:52] now think how able he is to prepare for
[2:22:56] us a body
[2:22:58] to live like his own glorious body if we
[2:23:03] want to live
[2:23:04] there is something in US calls to live
[2:23:09] and there's something in us that calls
[2:23:13] to do right
[2:23:14] then God will will call somebody to the
[2:23:19] platform or Pulpit that will preach the
[2:23:23] absolute truth why see it shows you then
[2:23:27] if you're a real child of God you begin
[2:23:32] to cry out God take it away from me
[2:23:39] circumcise me from this
[2:23:42] take these things away from me why if
[2:23:46] it's needed for your heavenly home that
[2:23:51] you're going to where he's gone to
[2:23:53] prepare you've got to be real word bride
[2:23:58] of Christ
[2:24:00] so there's a body waiting for you
[2:24:04] your spirit's got to come into that body
[2:24:07] it can't be a deformed spirit
[2:24:11] so what happens is just follow me
[2:24:14] through
[2:24:16] you can't change what you are
[2:24:18] but what happens is we're at this time
[2:24:25] the hour that we're living right now I'm
[2:24:27] going to read it to you we're at that
[2:24:29] time where we start to hear from that
[2:24:33] body
[2:24:34] we know that he's got to prepare his
[2:24:37] plane then we are craving to be ready to
[2:24:43] get ready for that body
[2:24:48] then we said I can't act like this take
[2:24:52] it from me I can't think like this take
[2:24:55] it from me I can't go there in this
[2:24:58] condition he take provide for me
[2:25:03] the Deliverance provide for me the word
[2:25:07] how much more can he provide for you
[2:25:10] what you have need of to be prepared for
[2:25:14] that body
[2:25:17] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:25:21] there's a call
[2:25:24] in our hearts
[2:25:26] look at
[2:25:30] just like he talks about that little boy
[2:25:33] paragraph 104. how do you look in God's
[2:25:37] mirror
[2:25:38] does it reflect a daughter or son of God
[2:25:42] is there something which you hear
[2:25:46] that does it make you hate the man
[2:25:49] that's saying it
[2:25:52] or is there something pulling saying I
[2:25:55] know that man is right because that's in
[2:25:59] the scripture
[2:26:00] then that's the vitamins needed for this
[2:26:05] body that's ordained to be there a house
[2:26:10] that the other one is going to need when
[2:26:15] you get there see this house if we have
[2:26:19] borne an Earthly image we will bore a
[2:26:23] Heavenly image you see what he's saying
[2:26:26] he's saying the reason you're calling
[2:26:28] these things because that's the vitamin
[2:26:31] this other house needs this other body
[2:26:34] needs
[2:26:36] this body needs a perfect Christian this
[2:26:39] body needs something that's without spot
[2:26:42] or wrinkle because so this body's there
[2:26:47] it's in God's mind and it's
[2:26:52] predestinated a spirit
[2:26:55] to come from this life
[2:26:57] when this body falls off into that body
[2:27:04] but it can't be deformed
[2:27:08] so what God do he sent a messenger
[2:27:11] put a man in the Pulpit to tell the
[2:27:14] truth to give the vitamins to prepare
[2:27:17] this spirit for that body
[2:27:22] do you see it
[2:27:25] he says
[2:27:28] remember we think so much of this body
[2:27:31] we put so many clothes on it we do so
[2:27:34] many things that's unnecessary change
[2:27:37] after change after change all these
[2:27:40] things oh just everybody
[2:27:42] just let somebody start something
[2:27:46] paint your steps red and watch the
[2:27:49] Joneses paint there's red
[2:27:52] do you change from a Chevy to a Ford
[2:27:54] they just can't stand it
[2:27:57] now listen
[2:27:59] it's matching time
[2:28:06] you let
[2:28:08] a woman come to church
[2:28:11] certain kind of hat on watch all the
[2:28:15] women will get that especially the
[2:28:18] pastor's wife see you just Watch What
[2:28:21] Happens
[2:28:23] now that's the truth it's absolutely the
[2:28:26] truth it's matching time brother it
[2:28:30] ought to be matching time all them all
[2:28:33] them things is for a purpose I don't
[2:28:37] care whether my clothes match my
[2:28:39] trousers I have a hard time my wife and
[2:28:42] daughter-in-law somebody will tell me
[2:28:44] what kind of tie to wear with it I don't
[2:28:47] care whether they match though I want my
[2:28:50] experience to match God's word that's
[2:28:53] the thing because that's where I aim to
[2:28:57] live not down on the corner
[2:29:00] Yonder with the Joneses but Yonder in
[2:29:04] the glory where Jesus is gone to prepare
[2:29:07] a place for me yes we want that yes sir
[2:29:12] keep from all this
[2:29:18] and these are my last statements
[2:29:21] they're not mine but they're his
[2:29:24] this old Earthly Tabernacle here you
[2:29:27] know what it is

[2:37:45] ready to be dissolved we're preparing to
[2:37:49] enter into the Heavenly and we now feel
[2:37:54] the strange call
[2:37:57] to God to go to this great even Eden and
[2:38:03] before we can be born here our little
[2:38:07] bodies cry for something
[2:38:10] that had to be provided or we would be
[2:38:14] an Afflicted child here if it wasn't
[2:38:21] is it sinking in
[2:38:25] God
[2:38:27] has no afflictions up there

[2:38:49] is a heaven to go to there is a hell
[2:38:53] to stay away from
[2:38:56] there's there's so many things
[2:39:00] that
[2:39:03] we
[2:39:06] we could
[2:39:08] say
[2:39:09] but I hope you understand what he's
[2:39:13] saying
[2:39:14] there's a call now
[2:39:16] it's a matching time now maybe you've
[2:39:20] never been there before maybe you fought
[2:39:23] the fight and you struggled and I could
[2:39:26] go all back to this book and talk how
[2:39:29] brother Brown talks how you mature it's
[2:39:31] all in there
[2:39:33] but he says now it finally comes down
[2:39:36] to where there's a a a strange call
[2:39:41] in the bride because they know the hours
[2:39:44] at hand yeah
[2:39:47] and they want to match up
[2:39:49] because it's matching time
[2:39:52] and I hope you feel that
[2:39:55] I hope we shake ourselves
[2:39:57] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[2:39:59] it's time to put those things behind as
[2:40:02] when we used to think of a child
[2:40:05] but now we're adults
[2:40:09] we're called
[2:40:10] let's make our calling an election sure
[2:40:13] let's connect with our future
[2:40:17] let's get involved in the things that
[2:40:19] are to be
[2:40:21] and I'd just like to close with this
[2:40:23] paragraph the musicians can come
[2:40:29] you know there's a
[2:40:31] yeah and you know if you read this
[2:40:33] message or you go back and study it we
[2:40:35] know what that Mansion is that he has
[2:40:38] over there it's a body
[2:40:40] and this is just for some people that
[2:40:43] had wondered what that body will be like
[2:40:46] uh
[2:40:48] and uh and so I'd like to read this to
[2:40:52] you
[2:40:53] in closing because
[2:40:57] he's got one for you
[2:41:01] he's got one of these bodies right here
[2:41:03] for you
[2:41:06] so then I seen that and these women run
[2:41:09] up and was throwing their arms around me
[2:41:13] and hugging me and calling me brother
[2:41:16] and now they were women
[2:41:20] but there can never be sin in that place
[2:41:24] they were a woman paragraph 126 I'm
[2:41:26] sorry Brothers
[2:41:28] paragraph 126.
[2:41:31] they were a woman
[2:41:33] but there can never be sin
[2:41:36] in that place
[2:41:38] they were a woman
[2:41:40] but see what made us now
[2:41:46] a
[2:41:48] what made us now a woman with a gland a
[2:41:52] female gland and the man with the male
[2:41:55] gland
[2:41:57] it's for raising children
[2:42:00] there it won't be
[2:42:06] they'll all be one gland
[2:42:10] but they'll still be in the form
[2:42:13] the Earthly image that they were here
[2:42:18] will be there
[2:42:20] but there will be never can be sin
[2:42:23] it'll all the same
[2:42:27] they'll all be
[2:42:29] that they'll all be no more children
[2:42:32] raised there
[2:42:33] that's right
[2:42:35] it'll be that way so I look
[2:42:39] and these women and he goes on
[2:42:42] just think of that body
[2:42:45] this one caused us a lot of trouble
[2:42:48] but that one's not going to have all
[2:42:50] that reproductive energy and all that
[2:42:53] stuff oh Glorious Day
