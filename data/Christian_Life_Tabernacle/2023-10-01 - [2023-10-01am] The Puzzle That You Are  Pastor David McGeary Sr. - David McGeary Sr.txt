Description:
The Puzzle That You Are
Christian Life Tabernacle
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
October 1, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

welcome to the house of the Lord as David said oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever let's bow our heads we go to him in prayer our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again for the sun which shines Upon Us Lord and not just the Su n but the S so n for the Son of God has comeing this day to Quicken our hearts Lord L we're thankful of it we're thankful we're able to rise and give you praise and by the singing of these songs Lord and assemble ourselves together in expectation Lord that you said you'd be in our midst and by the opening of the word Lord the preaching by the foolishness of preaching Lord that our hearts may be convicted and converted unto the the right and Living Way granted Lord this morning as we Lord just intend to lay aside our thoughts even our physical beings Lord and have communion with you today Lord we ask you'd be in our midst Lord you make yourself manifest to each one of us in your own special way Lord if there be any sick or needy in our midst Lord you're a great healer that work is finished Lord that may something raise our faith to a level that we can accept our healing the benefit fits of being a Believer Grant it to us now Lord so Lord as we Endeavor just to draw closer to you be with us now we ask this all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen all right we're going to read just a short Psalm this morning um know you you know you're going to be up here and you have many many thoughts that you'd like to go to and just exhort and and try to benefit someone by what you might say and and I had a song picked out and you know you hear ministers evangelists at times come and say well you know in preparation for this service or this set of meetings I was going to go in this direction and the Lord lead you in another Direction it is true you know uh you open God's word every day it's a new every morning that's right and uh what you thought yesterday or or the day before may not be what he wants you to think about today and uh so we're going to reflect on just a short Psalm this morning rather than a long one which you may benefit from that but uh Psalm 93 and especially there on the fifth verse Holiness becometh thine house oh Lord forever you know there's a beauty and Holiness that you don't get everywhere and we're able to come together like this especially standing up here and you're able to look out on a Congregation of people that have been called out set aside elected to walk in what we're walking in we're blessed of the lord we don't do this because we want to be different but because we are different we serve a true and living God in 2 Corinthians 6:16 Paul tells the people if I can find it here ye are the Temple of the Living God as God ha said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people that's what I want to declare this morning that we are the people of God Amen and if you turn back to 1 Corinthians 3:16 it says know ye not ye are a temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you amen amen it's not uh by our own actions we do these things and Paul my my he uh I kind of term it the the conundrum of Paul or the Paradox of Paul how he was as he calls himself the Pharisee of Pharisees that he was strict and knew you look at the the New Testament scriptures what Paul wrote in his letters how much he quoted David or even the Old Testament he says Elias you know he said that uh they have ears they hear not they have eyes they see not I believe that's in Hebrews 11 Romans 11 excuse me pardon me for just a little side thing here God hath not Cast Away his people which he fornew what ye not what the scripture said of Elias how he maketh an intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they've killed my prophets and he goes on talking about how are the Jews condemned he says no they're blinded in part so the fullness of the Gentiles become in we're blessed people and Paul talks about that mystery his whole message was a mystery of God the mystery being that Christ in you the hope of glory amen that's what we're exhibiting to a lost and dying world right now is Christ in you the hope of glory amen and I would ask this I I uh I kind of uh uh ask my wife and also my sister-in-law Lori just to see what they would say but I I had this thought and it's a strange one and I I think strange thing sometimes but uh what was Eve's maiden name anybody know think about that she had a maiden name H it was Adam right before she was Eve she was Adam right and you dwell on that she is him that's right she came from him who are we he said everything that God was he poured into Christ everything that Christ was he poured into his church we serve a true and living perfect God and far be it from me to call myself perfect but I believe we all serve a perfect God and if deity Reigns in us he says she is him we are him we're called to a higher calling this morning we are a temple of the Holy Ghost let's just read that Psalm before I get carried away here amen reading together Psalm 93 the Lord reth he is clothed with Majesty the Lord is clothed with strength wherewith Heath girded himself the world also is established that it cannot be moved thy Throne is established of old thou art from Everlasting the floods have lifted up oh Lord the floods have lifted up their voice the s lift up their waves the Lord on high is mightier than the voice of many Waters yay than the mighty waves of the sea thy testimonies are very sure Holiness becometh thine house O Lord forever and may I at this uh really do appreciate Brother Paul's message on Wednesday where is he at Lord bless you brother amen I don't know how many more of than myself are benefiting from the correction that we heard on Wednesday night but I believe it will all Lift us up higher amen let me add this too that he he talked about Elijah you know and we' heard on tape not too many services ago about that spiritual food that Elijah got okay and how two different times he was fed by Ravens at the creek and then when he was under the juniper tree the angel of the Lord came down and he was running from Jezebel right and he got out there under that tree and he said oh Lord take me my work is finished I just want to die God wasn't through with him and he slept under that tree and he and an angel came and woke him up and says arise and eat there was a Cru of water and there was bread bacon on the coals and he went back to sleep but there's benefits in second helpings let me tell you cuz he came back and said arise and eat and he ate again and the Bible says he went in the strength of that meat for 40 days and 40 nights think of that and he went to the cave horb and that's where the Lord passed by and the the earthquake and the wind and in the fire the still small boys and he remind him there's still work to be done you have to go down and anoint these Kings over Syria and Jerusalem or over Israel and he said he also anoint Elisha to take your place so bless and then he let him know there's 7,000 that have not bowed their knee so thank you

over the past several weeks and uh it's really caused me to uh to uh you know do some self-examination and look at what am I uh what am I laboring for what am I struggling to to achieve and and where is that leading me and uh I ran across this quote um I'm not going to say the whole quote but you know brother brandom he compared uh the city of Babylon you know he said it was a perversion of Glory you know because they built the city on the river Euphrates and he said in that River ran by The Throne of the king and uh one thing about the river it has a current and uh you know um we see people today that you know are caught up in the things of the world and that that pulls on us you know every day we deal with it and uh you know it's pulling them towards you know spending their time and their energy our time and our energy to do things that honor that King and his throne and um but uh there's another river that we want to be caught up in its flow and uh you know and we just heard brother Paul you know and I just say it this way you know that basically there's two rivers that are set before us you know and one is life and one is death and it's a daily battle and you know to resist the wrong current but our desire is to be in that current that pulls us to a life of worship before our God and King and uh so this song's been on my heart it's uh I'm going to sing in Spanish it's a it's a song I it just came on my heart I've been singing it all almost all week and it's just been a blessing to me and you know we had a Babylon in Genesis so ever since then we speak different languages so I having the brothers put it on the board if they could in English but uh no I didn't bring that it with me but anyhow it goes like [Music] [Music] this [Music] [Music] for and

don't know him me surely wants to introduce himself to you I love that scripture when the Lord said little children fear not it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen what great comforting words let's bow our heads together our gracious Heavenly Father we've come this morning father because there's something in our hearts that tells us that this this life this world that we live in this Cosmos that we're a part of isn't the final end of our hearts in our lives there's something in us that tells us there's a land beyond the river something that speaks within our soul and calls deep calling to our original origin where where from whence we've come father we want to go back we've dropped down into this space of Time Lord and and now we're seeking our return and you came and spoke to us and said I am the way the truth the life no man can come unto the father but by me Lord and we're here today that you might speak to our hearts that that way might become a little clear father that life and Truth might be our portion this morning that we can see and that you would give us is have we ask you to bless us this morning in Jesus Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen Lord bless you this morning if you have your Bibles let's turn to a few scriptures this morning and uhu there's so many that could be read uh you know our messenger told us he said if you don't see Jesus Christ in every verse in the Bible go back and read it again well you'll pick a scripture and and it'll be a good thought and then all of a sudden you find yourself uh adding another scripture and another scripture and another scripture and pretty soon you have so many but we just like to read two portions of scripture one just a short verse uh found in Matthew the 6th chapter and the 8th verse we certainly greet you all this morning and we have any visitors among us we hope that you don't feel like a visitor we hope that you feel the comfort and love of the Lord Jesus and and that your heart is warmed by his presence he said says in uh in we know these great chapters of Matthew are just so rich to us but Jesus makes this simple statement he says be not ye therefore liken unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him amen so uh we just like to do that and then let's turn over to Peter um if we could and um and read the first uh few verses of um of um see if I have that correct here in my uh yes the second first Peter the 2 chapter it says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newb Maes did Desiring the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious how many's tasted that the Lord is gracious Amen to whom coming as unto Lively Stones disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated this morning I I I enjoyed that this morning brother Tim and uh especially when you ask about that maiden name that uh that got me to thinking because uh you know like a puzzle you know you want I wanted to sit on it and think and uh you know I it it but you know there's a lot of things like that that are said you know that uh cause you to think well I ran across one the other day that it it cause causes you to think and and uh this little statement uh is out of the book Running From the presence of the Lord uh my heart's leaning uh a little bit in that direction for next weekend I'm going to be in the a Cloverdale Bible w for a couple services so uh keep us in prayer there but this is what brother Bram says if you you can put it up there if you can find it Brothers it's uh paragraph uh six right in the beginning of the running of the presence of the Lord and uh could that can you find that real quick and but I I'll I'll read it if he can't find it but it says I think this is a great privilege tonight that I've waited on for some time the other day I was telling my wife I said I get so nervous waiting to get to the Tabernacle I have other friends of course I do around the world but there's something another about this Tabernacle here and uh so and then this is the statement that that really just struck me it said listen to this it's amazing I was took out of this dust around here when God gave me life here on the earth and I guess if he terries I'll be buried here somewhere when he comes he'll find me here somewhere and I just when I I just took that and I thought I I was taken out of the Dust of the earth somewhere around here and it struck me so much how that God has our lives so laid out and uh he's so mindful of us where we came from and how that that what Eternal beings we really are I know we don't look at ourselves as eternal being because of this mortal flesh but this was sowed in sin and born in iniquity and the curse of this flesh is death that's because the Lord took uh Adam took another route but we are also comforted with these great words that if you have eternal life you always had eternal life and that you were with him in the beginning and so only only the Lord in his infinite power and wisdom could go through time and take you out of the Dust of the Earth because it was all in him in the first place and so it's just such a marvelous thing and I hope it's a comforting thing to you today and I I know that there's a lot of pressure in the hour that we live in and a a a lot of uh fear spoken everywhere and uh doubt about the economy and uh uh doubt about uh the worth of our dollar and and unemployment and uh AI I think that's artificial intelligence well the whole world is an artificial intelligence it's none of what they're saying is true if they were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies don't you think they're still speaking lies but it it's such an atmosphere to try to live in and and you know so uh your economy you know I think well how am I going to pay my house bill how am I going to make my car payment you know what happens if Social Security collapses you know or what happens if I get really really sick and and all those things but I'm not looking for the world to take care of me amen do you know what I mean I mean I've I have I have an economic strategy that does not fail amen it says the righteous shall not bake bread amen well so if I can do my best to keep myself righteous he promised me that I wouldn't bake bread amen I don't have to sit at the table of Sinners I don't have to give in the pressures of the world I don't have to fall subject to what man thinks I don't have to change my thinking uh and what I stand for to be able to survive in this world he'll make a way you know most of us have had the fortune of living well but you know there's lots of people that have gone through lots of hard times and that have had to do nothing but rely on the Eternal Grace of the Lord for all that they have need of and and don't let that die don't let that wither away don't let that let's build our faith that's what we want we want to really to continue to build our faith uh we are living here today we've come here and we're here because we believe that soon and very soon he's going to return back and he's there's going to be a translation what we refer to as a Rapture a a changing of Dimensions where this Earthly body will fall away and we have one waiting for one that we can step into one that travels like a thought one that doesn't taste sickness nor death it's it's it's it's another a whole completely a different realm we live now in Satan's zeden and Satan's zeden and the God of this evil age is is governed by certain laws laws of physics laws of reaping and sewing there's there's laws that are are under and all those laws came with the first when man sinned he dropped out of that one great Dimension called Eden and he came into another dimension and that realm and this realm was set a guard that didn't allow man to pass from that Chasm unto the other Chasm but yet that still exists and by God's witness to witness us that that exists he allows that realm to drop into our Realm every now and then and we call that the supernatural where the supernatural will visit our realm and God will do for us things to keep his word alive in our heart but the purpose of the word of God is to bring us somewhere that's what he said he said in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would not tell you and I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and and we can't lose sight of that we can't we can't get into the framework of man's thinking that this is just religion oh you're religious or you have your religion what's your religion what's your belief in God uh what how do you interpret the Bible this is not any of of that this is a lost people who are not of this world who are trying to get back to another land and another dimension in the eyes of the world this is the greatest sci-fi story that ever was in existence a lost people living in a world that's not their world trying to get back to where they came from oh Hallelujah call me crazy but I I I can feel it calling amen it's close it's near it's pulsating and and the whole world can can uh is quaking be because of the uh Revelation and the calling of the Sons and Daughters of God again we don't want to we don't want to lose sight of that again I know that it we we in our lives that uh we have mates and we raise children and and we go on with the process of our lives and our civilization but if you can separate yourself as a being uh and realize that that you you're you're accountable and and and we need to take heed and work out our own salvation with you're and trembling and ask the Lord to make this world that we're going to from where I come from now they might come in and wrap me in a straight jacket after this service but I am not of this world I've come from God and I go back to God Amen I believe that with all my heart I believe that we saw the first fruits of the Resurrection we saw one that came though he had no sin in him he came by the way of sin the way that we came he was birthed into this world not the coming together of a man and woman not the coming together of God and Mary but he created in Mary the function of life and he was born and birthed in a manger and lived and learned Obed ience by the things that he suffered became subject totally subject to the word of God even to paying the penalty of sin which was death because in him he was life and life more abundant and the light of the world he rose again from the dead Hallelujah and what what what was he why when he rose again he conquered hell death in the grave so we and prooved to us beyond that grave beyond that funeral ceremony beyond that casket that gets rolled up beyond that there is a whole another world there's a whole another life there's a whole another reality death isn't the end of it for us death is like open the door you you know what I mean uh if if if you ever have to stand over my casket just be ready cuz it might start singing oh happy days right in the right in the box that's not me that's not me why there's there's more to me than that don't you feel that about yourself you know the world is so con concentrated on this flesh if you don't like the color of your eyes you can get different color you don't like your eyebrows or somebody will pluck them and pum them and paint them and brush them and Trim in them and and you know what I mean so you get you look just like a cat if you want to you know what I mean if you don't like your hair well we can add extensions we can fluff it we can puff it we can chop it we can twist it we can braid it we can do anything that you want with in fact you don't like that we can stick a whole another thing on you oh yeah if I don't like this you know I can I can take this pill and I can talk to Bosley and I can go down to see the wigger and you know what I mean I you can work on this thing all you want but I'll tell you one thing it ends up stooped and wrinkled and it goes you know we could we would give I I believe and I think it's still true that uh people spend more money on uh like cosmetics and personal AIDS than they do on food well they their their whole minds are pointed in the wrong direction and the carnal mind is enity with God the carnal mind is against God's ways it can't comprehend the things of God but what we want to do is our whole desire from the word of God and the preaching of the Gospel Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God we want to believe and begin to believe that this Supernatural Dimension this other realm I I don't maybe have vocabularies to explain it I I it to me it's the spirit of God the holy spirit that that Spirit wants to make contact with you and I know you you want to make contact with it and there's got to be something that said something that ignites that Faith to believe that faith that these two Realms can make contact and where do those two Realms come together those two Realms come together in The Believer they come together in the believing heart and and God deals from the inside out he deals with the heart the trouble is is that it's got to pass through the mind it's got to pass through the mind to get into the heart our messenger says what happens is it comes to your mind as a seed of God that when it drops into your heart then it becomes the will of God cuz it ABS once that word drops into your heart it absolutely possesses you you become possessed you become you become uh driven because it's if the battle's dropped out of your mind now it becomes a desire of your heart and your desire of your heart craves for that desire of your heart you you you call and you keep calling and then the great promise of God's word this is how God's work work he says then he gives you the desire of your heart amen he never promised to give you the fantasy of your mind but the desire of your heart the question is what is your heart's desire do you desire the world and the things of the world John not condemning us but trying to instruct us said if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not in you now that wasn't a condemnation it was an instruction in righteousness it was a I have it was an eye openening Revelation wait a minute examine yourself what's the desire of your heart if if if you if you love the world and the things of the world then the love of God hasn't made contact in you and the desire of your heart's not right but you'll never see God till your heart is right you'll observe them but we're not talking about that kind of seeing we're talking about the reality of seeing God in your life knowing that it's not you it's him that he did it that you've seen him in reality you haven't heard about him you haven't seen stories about him you haven't seen the effect on somebody else but it's become personal and you can say I have personally made contact with the other dimension I know it's real I have seen it come from that realm to this realm and manifest and do for me things that are Beyond everything that I could have even thought or desired because he is the same yesterday today and forever then then we start to understand oh I want to go to that place that's why what what was it he called it Earnest the earnest of our great expectation the earnest of our Salvation the earnest of our inheritance that that's what we're here for this morning we're not here for no other reason we're here to make the Rapture and my duty to those and I Don't Preach a gospel to the world I I'm not preaching to anybody outside of this building I have no message God sent a messenger he's got the message for the church he don't need little unindicated peons like us trying to bring his message he brought it he Vindicated it he put in it just what we need and can we ought to spend a lot of time instead of Channel hopping to every preacher listening to what he said amen that's right and you wouldn't get all these movements and all these mental things I don't want to be thrilled with a great IM in intellectual stimulation because somebody can put sentences together and paragraphs together and quotes together and draw a picture my mind has never seen that's it well you s Sav o Dolly did that did that go over your head oh well shows how old I am Tim no really this gospel is for I don't care how old you are this gospel is for you and that's what our goal is our goal is have the faith every member of this body this body here that we assemble ourselves under the banner of Christian Life Tabernacle it could be any name it does that's not the point it's a body that's fitted and joined together Lively Stones building a building together for the inhabitants of Jesus Christ that the works that he did you can do also that that is the point of of of our gathering that by faith that the word by faith can increase your faith that and and your wisdom and your knowledge of the things that God has for you that you will have by faith access to the supernatural that that Supernatural power can work in your lives not only for you but for others that you love and care for and then when we come to those places in our lives and and we're dedicated to that and we're personally each one of us dedicated to the kingdom of God living for God loving God loving one another as he loved us that the the love of God might be shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit that that we're word orientated word filled word life that that's what we want we want what he wants amen we want to we want to transform to what that we are to what that he wants us to be amen and that's where I just want to take a few moments this morning to to as Peter would say in his scripture to stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance to to bring into your heart a a remembrance of why that we got started in this in the first place I know why I got started because I was suicidal I was in desperate desperate condition I I was placed in a place uh that I I just didn't know where my life was at and he reached down his hand for me amen so this is not a place that we've done for ourselves it's what he's done for us amen but I'd like just to share a quick thought trusting that uh we won't be very long to morning but I I I certainly believe with all my heart that God is hid in Simplicity and not only does he hide in Simplicity but he reveals himself in simplicity so he hides himself in simple things in simple ways the ways that confound the wise and The Prudent but ways that he can reveal them to babes such as would learn and I know man thinks that he's a great spiritual giant that he has achieved all kinds of knowledge but isn't it amazing that all the knowledge that man has achieved all the science that he's gathered together all the history that he's recorded brother Matt's all going to pass away that's right amen it's all none of it's lasting none of it's lasting Heaven and Earth will pass away but Jesus said my word will not pass away and so he hides himself he hides himself in simple things he hides himself so that the wise and The Prudent pass over it that that that they they they keep looking for him to manifest in their minds they keep think waiting for him to manifest in their world in their organizations in their systems and their educations they they they think if there's a God he'll be the god of my realm he'll be the god of my creation he'll be the god of my thinking he'll be the god that comes the way that I think he should come that's why Israel missed their Messiah all the prophets all the words that were spoken everything that was prophesied everything that could done it all came to pass and it came pass right underneath their nose and they couldn't see it the Stars the wise men the everything about it the prophecies everything absolutely unfolded and it went right over their heads because they were expecting him to come the way that he thought they should come that's so personal and they missed it cuz he he HD himself he HD himself in a little baby from a little town called Nazareth in a little country of Galilee and snuck down to a town called Bethlehem everyday's Christmas to meall and was hid in a little baby and some Shepherds came and the angels appeared and said oh Hallelujah hosana in the highest blessed are men for today has born unto them a savior in Bethlehem wise men came and said I seen a star walks into the city gives the prophecy tells them and everything they search the scripture and they reject it and try to kill every kid in Bethlehem filling Rach the promise of the mour and of Rachel the children and all the scriptures absolutely fulfilled and yet he was hidden such a way that it just missed it and and you know one of the things that we're counseled to have in our day is ISA amen that we might see that our our actions are not blinded with greed that we're not caught up into systems and the things that that making money is is not what's the measure of success and it's history he hides himself there he was hid grew up right in the midst of them oh I I dream of it many times at night being a friend of the boy Jesus amen what did my some men like to have been his friend I don't know if they played marbles or what they did or rolled stones but I would have liked to B this friend he was different he was odd but he was special he said I call you friends are you a friend today de him we don't want to miss him he's here in Simplicity and then he reveals himself he doesn't reveal himself in enticing words he reveals himself by speaking to your heart in things that are so simple that the educated man would look at it and say oh that brother he he he he talks like a common man he he talks like he's uneducated well I'll have you to know that I made it through 8th grade I didn't quite do high school but you know what I mean that's how educated I am don't I hope the education is never what it's all about huh Paul was real educated and you know what he had to say about it so we won't go there because I know so many of you are devoting so much time for college and and all those things but don't let College have you miss I'd rather have a degree in Rapture a doctorate in the Rapture that's what I want my Doctrine to be my decree to be what's your degree well I don't know I don't know much about science but I know a whole lot about the Rapture amen I got so what are you then what what's your well I guess if it comes to the Rapture I'm a rocket SCI scientist cuz I'm going to blast right on out of here I'm going to have a pressurized suit that'll take me right past the Sun and so is a marvelous thing amen so I I I just want to uh share this with you this morning I hope the Simplicity of it isn't offensive and and that you won't sit back and think well you know I really like deeper things well the only thing I know that's deep is a six- foot grave so when you start talking about deep you know what I mean deep I I remember the prophet God one he said I'm going to say something to you that's real deep now and I kept looking at it and looking at it and I and it was so simple it it was it was just so basic in everything but it was so hid till he gives you isav that you might see and and that why we want to pray for isab I pray for isab that thou may see pray for white rment that the N your nakedness doesn't uh uh appear you know pray for gold tried in fire you know the these are the things that that we should be pressing for in in order to be prepared to make that transition from this Dimension to that Dimension because you're not we can't get through there in the condition that we're in our prophet of God told us he said the church will not meet the challenge of the hour they will not make it in the condition that they're in and so his message begin to come out for the purpose of getting us ready it wasn't trying to create a new theology that we could sit around as theologians and study so this this is burning in my heart because there's so much pull and every time I see things pull it always pulls away from the absolute Simplicity of the message of the hour and it it's it's a always a continual diminishing of the importance of the messenger right that's exactly amen so we talked a little bit I I I think it maybe it was uh last Sunday evening I believe it was about the the secret Gardener and we talked a little bit about how that we know God planted a seed and we know that we're the Earth right we're the ground that that seed was planted in and he he Gardens that seed we don't see it he's a secret Gardener we don't see him working in our lives but ever since you were a little child he he he governed and worked on your life and he he cultivated it and he surrounded it uh every situation in your circumstance he he was lording over it if I could say at that he was the gardener over it he was watching over your life and and and and taking your life and and watching you grow can you didn't even know he was there he was keeping things in out of your life he was trying to deal with your heart he was allowing you to get in circumstances that he got you out of he he you know he permitted you to do these things he permitted you to do different things but he was still in charge of your care that's right and and he's always been in charge of your care he's never left you nor forsake you and in fact it's he even put from your great great grandparents he put you together and together and together and brought you to where that you are now you say say well I was born well you know I look at my parents and I think well why didn't I get believing parents he knew I might be the Redemption of my parents you know I mean why did why did my you know my parents didn't but you might someone might ask my father's gone on now my mother's 101 years old you might ask some I say well why did my parents get divorced why did this happen why did that happen you know none of that affected you because you had a secret Gardener right he knew how to separate things out of your life he knew how to keep effects of things off of you all the time you were in the palm of his hand and nothing could pluck you out he if he started a work he will finish it he will Garden it till its end and so questions come up he allows those questions to come up he allowed you to feel drifted he would allowed to have you feel empty he allowed to have you feel displaced unassociated I know that feeling well I just feel like I'm not associated with nothing I don't have any contact I I just seems like I'm floating and and I I need something to Anchor to something something to give me you know and I mean and then the secret Gardener will come by and he'll feed my soul sometimes he digs us up and he Roots it and so we we wanted to let it place in our heart that he has not left us he he here by his promised word and he's governing the hearts and lives of men he didn't sit back and cross his arms and hope that you make it through the Maze of life you know what I mean and like a little mouse in a maze that maybe you learn your way and you finally come out the other side and breathe a sigh of relief and say I made it no when you reach the dead end he reached down and opened the door then he let you go on and then he but all the time he was he was The Gardener of your life I like to use another analogy this morning to cause our hearts to look inward to our condition to make contact with our inward man and to become more focused and have a greater sense of reality to the spirit being that we are this flesh you have not not a whole lot of choice of what happens to it people do everything they can I I hate to tell everybody but even Jack Elaine passed away that went over most of your heads too anybody know who jackan was all right you're all over 40 now everybody wants to know who jackeline was he was was the first big health expert diet guy back in the 50s and 60s and early 70s that was going to live forever I'd like to just take this little thought a thought that is given for the purpose of you reflecting inside and making contact with your inner man leaving the Battle of your mind and making contact with the part of you that's leaving we are not preaching a staying message we are preaching a leaving message let me say that again the desire in my heart is that you make contact with the the part of you that's leaving this man is staying this inward Man is leaving I want to know and make contact with the Inner Man and what it is that my inner man has got to become in order to step out of this Frame or prison or pest house that I'm in I've got to be able to have something within me that's so built up so strong so Under the Influence so in contact with this other dimension that it's such a reality to me that I can come from this side of it to that other side of it and am willing to leave this behind amen as handsome as he is I want to step out I should have had more amens I you you you should be able to step out from it right and leave it behind and you've got to be ready for that hour is coming and it's a choice that you're going to be faced with that's right amen so I'd like to call this thought the puzzle that is you the puzzle that is you or the puzzle that you are the puzzle the so many of our lives are puzzling it's a puzzle and you understand a puzzle a puzzle is just made out of so many pieces so many if you get a puzzle box and you you look at it and and uh uh I have friends that are puzzle people and I think they're a little overboard but they'll get a puzzle and they won't look at the picture and they'll pour it out and they'll start to put the puzzle together and I thought why do you do that you don't know what you're working for you don't know what you'll get I like to see the picture and in the puzzle that we are the picture that that we see is the picture is the word of God which we know is Jesus Christ in the beginning was the word and the Word was God many times we say Jesus Christ we think of the man that walked the Seas of Galilee we only have images of him uh this is the image that we kind of heard that may be the closest from those that have seen him but but that is kind of in an abstract uh form the best that we have we knew he was a man he was a man of like passion we knew he had shoulder length hair we knew he dressed and was a commonl looking man the only thing that separated him from anybody else was his words and his deeds in other words you wouldn't know who he was until he spoke and then when he spoke there was no man that spoke like him amen and when when he did things they stood back and said no man could do these things unless God be with them really and all in all he was no different than you that's right he came in the form of sin which you are he was no different than you are he just came forth he was there he was born he was raised up he learned obedience but and he suffered things he went through life like we went but there was a time that the time come that the spirit of God moved on him and and he he went out to fast and pray then he come down to the river and he was baptized he went to a marriage feast and his ministry started oh wouldn't that be a beautiful sermon type amen bringing new on wine wine that was never tasted before Oh word of God is wonderfully Rich isn't it and and so we we have the picture so we have the picture uh it was given to us in in in the word of God or if I could say that the message of the hour is the puzzle of our day it's the picture of our day it's it it's what laid there that we we are supposed to be and so it's put there but it's not assembled there's assembly required if I ever shop that's the first thing I look for does it say assembly needs to be required and then I make a couple phone calls to some brother say are you doing anything I'm busy are you doing anything you I get all these excuses and then I just don't buy it but I don't got no choice here assemblies required he showed you the picture and you are the puzzle you're the puzzle Hallelujah the puzzle that you are you're filled with all these parts and all these pictures and you're supposed to come from what you are which is a big scrambled bunch of pieces to what his picture of you is what he foreordained you to be but you you got that it's it it's placed that way so your Lively Stones your Lively pieces but you're fitted and joined together built into his building or his Tabernacle we could talk about Statue of the perfect man add this piece add that piece until you come into the statue or the picture of the a statue of a perfect man so okay if I could get you to understand this is that you didn't come put together you came with all the pieces in you and you have to work that out you've got you've got to to to start putting the picture together and so we we have the picture and now so what are the pieces the pieces are given to us but they're they're not great big pieces they're little pieces they're they're sermons and Revelations are are giving you the Lord little things that he speaks to your heart that he speaks to your mind that he reveals to you that that he opens up that he gives you is have the sea now those are pieces of the puzzle little things he shows you things he shows you don't have things that he shows you have and so we have laying before us all these great pictures and all these great pieces of of the the puzzle are all there but there comes a time when those pieces of the puzzle have got to be put together and it's a time now that you've got got the start I have got the start we have got the start of assembling the puzzle that this message was the pieces of this puzzle and putting them together and making a true living bride of Jesus Christ fitted and joined together amen taking this revelation you have you you've got this pieace and if this piece doesn't fit into the puzzle of your life you don't get out the scissors you start to understand this piece doesn't fit this puzzle I can't fit this in this don't work this doesn't create the picture that was given me then it's not a picture that's hung on the wall it's the puzzle that you are the questions the pieces of your life that God brings and reveals to you through sermons through messages through song through hymns spiritual uh words and things that start to reveal to you the pieace of the puzzle that is in you so you are a puzzle within yourself and you are a part of a greater puzzle do you believe that when you get one piece in place that's a glorious thing and you can rejoice in that to a season but pretty soon you've got to move on so there's got to be there's got to be a a a a place that that all these things that we we've learned all these Revelations that we have the truths that he's opened up to us the the dealings with our heart there comes a time when this puzzle has got to come together in form into that being that that we are yes we can't just leave the pieces of the puzzle laying everywhere there's got to come the time we start putting this puzzle together and we kind of we could look at it you know how it is when you build a puzzle there's certain pieces that have one thing in common the flat Edge that's right right so you you get the flat Edge out you get the you build the border right so now you know that the framework of the pieces is going to come together within this framework so there's a frame that's got to be buil so and just in my analogy just to just to create some inner connection I'm I'm I don't want to talk to your minds I want to talk to your hearts but that frame of that puzzle are the frame is built out of if I could say they pieces and piece a greater than Solomon is here you start you start seeing the frame come together you got you start seeing the picture is within the framework of this great revelation of the hour you know you you you start to see these things as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the mighty Angel descends and puts his foot on the land and the Sea you start to see this Frame come together you start to say there's a picture that comes forth in the midst of the frame of this message I'm I'm part of that picture I'm a piece of that puzzle and then you look at yourself and you say I'm a many mixed up bunch of pieces and so now he's going to have to you got have to identify those pieces well he's the one putting the puzzle together he's the one that's assembling the puzzle of your life and the many different pieces that you have emotions and different things that you have that are all spread out he starts to take those pieces and identify them to you that you can place them where they belong the question is when we going to build the puzzle I know puzzle Builders they they go by and they take all the colors and they stack every color together and they they start they start separating it out they start putting it there but one day in order to achieve the picture or the goal they've got to come together having a puzzle doesn't make the picture you've got to assemble it so he begins and and and you you so that I don't take much longer but you you've got to recognize what's going on on you've got to know that the sermons that that were that were preached by our messenger were to identify to you the pieces of the puzzle that's in you the puzzle you are the things that you're missing the things that aren't you aren't thinking right the holy spirit is to lead you and to guide you into all truth and righteousness it's to speak to your hearts it's to open the word of God to you it's to reveal the word of God to you open the things of God to you that you can start to see right you can't you can't sit back you know sometimes you you just can't be a coward all your life you got to step up and say I got to put this thing in my life regardless because how it affect anybody if this isn't in my life I'll never get the picture finished amen and he's coming for a complete statue something that's real something that's put together so you hear sermons like why Christ speak well there's a revelation in that message that's right there's something in that sermon that is a piece of your puzzle it's not a library piece or a study message it's not a sermon source and I'm afraid the message has become nothing but a sermon source to too many people and it's not dealing with where we're at it's not dealing with where we're going it's become crowd pleasing we don't need no more Vindication this message has been Vindicated it's time we take the revelation of this message and start putting the puzzle together put it together in our lives not the puzzle that somebody else is the puzzle that I am if I could get my puzzle put together then it could be put in the greater puzzle and we'll leave here that's right one place the prophet of God said take cannabis how quick would you KN move if you knew that was an absolute the first 10 people that get their person person Al puzzle put together will finish the puzzle of the ages and we'll be gone I know it would happen in my life there would be a lot of token applying does this fit does this fit does this fit does this add to my character no we got to understand that what has been going on the M he comes preach sermons like perfect Faith he's trying to reveal to you in that sermon that sermon needs to be taken personally by you you need to start going to the the the the revealer of the pieces you don't want me to put a puzzle together for you you know that we all think of ourselves really the scripture says more highly than we ought to am but if I was to draw my picture of a Christian I would draw myself with a little Halo and my little praying hands but that's that not going to match right he already has the picture it's his word that's right he already has an image of you yes what you are what he for ordained you to be but he just didn't give it to you the image and say here you are he gave you a bunch of scattered up pieces of the puzzle inside of your heart and your soul and now through the preaching of the word of God the foolishness of preaching and the message of the hour he starts identifying those little pieces of the puzzle in you and you start to see yourself come together and then there comes a time where you've got to take all these pieces and you've identified them this is the truth this is the word this is the truth I have this brother bam taught this brother bam taught that brother bam taught this we we believe this we believe that we got all these great pieces of this puzzle but someday those have got to form into an image the puzzles got to be put together and become a reality and that's what he's done he's given us the pieces works his faith expressed wisdom versus Faith oh I could just go down and start reading sermon title after sermon title but when you understand every single one of those sermons was given to reveal a piece of the puzzle you are there might be 10 pieces in one sermon and he reveals them to you one piece at a time time one piece at a time one Revelation at a time what does it do it takes the Revelation to build the puzzle he's given you you have it in you who you are is in you the picture is in you but we we we look for a completed picture when we we need to start to understand it's not a completed picture it's a puzzle pieces right that he's Lively Stones things that come to life and then you've got to put that together and put this with this add to your faith virtue patience virtue Temperance Adam build them put the building together fit it in joined what does he have to do he's got to fit you and join you with other believers cuz that's part of the puzzle is your ability to fit and it join he'll give you sermons knoweth it not humble thyself all these are Revelations all these are are are Mysteries all these are the secrets of your heart to being discerned so that you can come aware of a piece of the puzzle that you need to put in the picture add this to your life he shows you something this don't fit out and the puzzle begins to come together and the puzzle that you are begins to take form and then it can be added to the greater puzzle but it's got to come together it's got to be completed you can't get in on mommy's coattails you can't get in on Daddy's coattails you can't get on the preacher's coattails the this church isn't going it's not going as a body we hope there's individuals in here that are going there may be three kinds of Believers in here there may be make believer we don't know you know you know by how the word is identifying the pieces of your life and you've got you ask yourself am I letting this word of God identify the pieces of the puzzle in me and I am putting them together and building and forming and having a union an invisible Union between the bride the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom it is my picture coming together and there's things in our lives that are puzzling why does this happen why does that happen you know God God's got everything so in control yes you know that's why prayer is such a wonderful thing we know he knows has need of what we have need of before we ask you know why you prayer so he can show you he answers your prayer it gives him an a an Avenue to let you know that he's real okay it takes it it's a way weapon against Satan so when you pray and ask for something and God gives it to you Satan can't say oh that's circumstance that's happening oh that would have happened no you say wait a minute Satan I prayed he answered he lives and when you start to see the puzzles come together you go years and all of a sudden Pieces come together and when you get one piece it's like a magic piece everything's just you go slam slam slam slam slam and you a whole bunch of stuff just comes together at once you're forming you're growing the scripture said we're growing that we might grow take the sincere milk of the word that we might grow growing is the putting together of the pieces in your life and sometimes at the end the puzzle gets more difficult but his grace is greater because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world and we can begin to find this
