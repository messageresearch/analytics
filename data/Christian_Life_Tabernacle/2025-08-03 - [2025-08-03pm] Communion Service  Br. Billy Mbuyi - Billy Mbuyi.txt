Description:
Communion Service  
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Christian Life Tabernacle
August 3rd, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Doesn't matter where you're sitting, his hand reaches. Hallelujah. We want to remind you that we have prayer meeting this Tuesday from 7 to 8. It's always the first Tuesday after we do communion. Sister Jalicia writes she wasn't feeling well this morning. We just want to keep her in prayer that the mighty hand of God may go by her way where she's at. Give her a touch. We want to remember our pastor who is out laboring. Man, I that's a lot of services. And I know the Lord will give him the strength necessary for the journey to be able to be a blessing to those people. We'll ask brother Orlando to come and pray. Brothers are taking the tithes and offerings. If you could please come up. Let us bow our heads. Most gracious and eternal father, Lord, as we can all reflect, Lord, on your hand that touched us &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; that day at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes. Father, and we can Lord allow our faith being established in that, Lord, that that work that you begun in us, Lord, that you promise to finish it until the day of Jesus Christ. Yes. No matter what storm or pestilence may rise in our lives, Lord, we know, Father, that by your word, you'll see us to the end, Lord. Lord, as we come tonight, Lord God, and Lord, laying all things aside, Father, and putting you first even in this hour, Lord, Lord, a time of consecration, a time of sanctification even in our lives, Father, for for more of you and less of us, Father. Lord, for the needs, Lord, that have been laid before us today, Lord. We we know that only you can meet those needs, Father. Only you can touch us, Father, and feel us, Lord. Lord, he's even as the word was spoken today, Father. And Lord, and how you touched us, Father, and corrected us and shaped us and mold us, Lord, and even brought us back for more of your word today. Lord, we thank you, Father, once again, Lord God, for everything that has transpired in this service, Lord, and we commit the remaining of it as well, Father. Bless the tithes and offering, Lord, that they may be used for the furring of your kingdom, Lord. And we just love you, Father.

Our gracious father. So thankful to be gather in your presence once again tonight. Lord, I'll say this. You spoke to us this morning. And Lord, we're so thankful for your word. And father, I know one thing that has the power to transform and that is your word. And father, we know as the prophet will say that if we want to see big things, we need to invite the word of God in our midst, Lord. And Father, we invite you that you may just come and that the supernatural may be manifested in our midst, Father, not naturally that we could see it in our eyes and things, but Father, that the workings that you are doing through your word and that we may see lives change and people come closer to you. Lord, we only have one goal as we heard it this morning that we can make rapture our goal. Lord, I pray, Father, that everything be said that it may lead us in that direction. We have no message of our own, but you've sent us a message, Lord, that we can take and eat of it and being transformed. We want to commit the service into your hands. Once again, Father, we've sang songs and we've done what the man part can do. Now, we invite the God part to come and come on the scene. Bless us, I pray. remember our pastor, those that are not here, those that couldn't make here. Lord, we just pray for them that you may touch their heart and father that you make their burdens a little easier, Lord, that you may make a way, Lord, that they may be gathered with the saints. We commit everything we are and ask those things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Welcome everyone in the house of God for the communion service. Amen. We'll try to not to be too long and uh so we can uh jump right into communion. Uh so let's open our Bible for s uh for scripture reading. Amen. Tonight. Amen. I trust you enjoy the word this morning. Amen. Amen. Certainly ask that the Lord will certainly strengthen and bless our brother Matthew. Amen. I believe he just plowed in there and uh we've been plowing in the same field. So you'll know. And so we've been preaching to one another. And so he came and he preached that and I told him, we'll just touch on what we can so we can move into communion. 1 Corinth uh 1 Peter chapter 1 uh verse one uh through five the scripture says if I could turn there says Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ through the strangers scattered out throughout Pontis and Galatias and Capadashia and Asia and uh uh Bethania. I'm pretty sure I just butchered every name that I just called out. Elected according to the fornowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience unto and the sprinkling of blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God of our father uh of our and L and our father Lord Jesus Christ who um according to his abundant mercy has begotten us unto again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. Also, let's turn the scripture that was read this morning in um Exodus chapter 14. Amen. We'll read uh verse 13 and and and uh 134 and 15. It says, "And Moses said unto the people of unto the people, fear ye not. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show un show to you today. For the Egyptian which have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. And the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore cry out unto me, speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward. Lord, we ask that you bless your word to us. We commit it to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God bless you. have your seats. Man, like I said, I I just want to for the sake of time, uh maybe we'll touch some of these things um in the future, but just for the sake of time, um I just want to uh make statement and move forward. Uh because if I try to read all the quotes, I won't have time. we have communion and I de definitely don't want to take up too much time and I believe the word of God is an exhaustable fountain. You know, I was telling about brotherh Ben in the back. He said, you you start reading and you say, "I'm going to lay a foundation." And pretty soon you realize everything is a foundation. And and so as we heard brother Matthew preached this morning that as Christians, we we have an objective and we have a goal and that's the rapture. And I want to say this even within our own lives that everything that if if something is an objective and a goal for you then everything that you do must line up with that goal and objective. You you can't claim something to be an objective and you do something different because when you speak about objectives and goals really it's not what you say it's the very action you take that really determine what is your objective and what is your goal I could tell you my goal is to become a a an air airplane pilot but if I never taken a class I never done anything that doesn't really qualify It's just words, right? The really what matters is when we we understand what is our objective and what is our goal. If we claim a rapture is our objective and our goal, then the life that we live every day must reflect what is our objective and our goal. Let me say this, not it must reflect it. It actually is reflective of that. So if you claim you're going to heaven, you live like one that's going to heaven. If you claim you you you have rapture as your goal, you live like one whose whose goal is to go in the rapture. So if anybody's action is contrary to what they say, all they are is they are contrarian to themselves. They are basically lying to themselves. They are saying something that cannot be achieved because to achieve something the objective and the action must line up together. So our objective and our goal is not what we say but it's really build and the measure and the unit of measurement for that is our lives. That's why we when you become a Christian it's not what you say. The scripture says when they recognize them to be Christian it wasn't by what they were preaching. It wasn't by what they were saying. They recognized them to be Christian by the life that they were living every day. When they saw their action, when they saw the movement, when they saw the way they were conducting themselves, they were able to take what they were their action and tie it to Jesus action and call them this must be the disciples of that man because they act exactly like that man acted. So it wasn't so much in words but it was in action. Well, so our footsteps, every footstep that we make is a measure towards our objective. And that's why the prophets say often time that even as Christians that the decisions that we make they are leading us somewhere. So we could say we are Christians but we have to be very aware that the decisions that I'm making today and the actions I'm making today they are leading me into a direction. And if we claim once again that the the rapture is our goal, then I believe we have been given the word to lead us into that direction. We have been given what is essential for us to move into that direction. And I want to say this, we live in a time where the word has been provided where what we need to do is to lay in the presence of the son. Brother said that he may bake all the green out of us that we may become that which God wants us to be. Let me say this again. God at the end time is not coming to marry a little girl. He's coming to marry a bride who's made herself ready by the word of God. So the word of God is here to mature us. Because if you really look at this message, this is a message of maturity. And I was talking about a Matthew. I said to me when I look at why Christ speak, it's almost like a dividing line. Yet we are on one side the prophet is bringing the church to a place where they can understand. We as the people of God, we got to stop doubting who we really are. You know, God cannot save you today and tomorrow you think you're lost and there's tomorrow. I if you in that condition, you can never achieve anything. You cannot build a house if you keep breaking the foundation. &gt;&gt; You you if you you cannot build anything if you keep going over the foundation and bu rebuilding it and rebuilding it. What God is wanting out of the believers in this end time is that we can come to a place where we have gone past the doubting of ourselves, the mind battle of ourselves, and we know that we have been elected, called, and commissioned. End of story. I don't care what you do, those things don't change. You can, your behavior can change. What you say can change, but one thing that doesn't change is the word of God. If God commissioned you to a work, let me say this, nobody else can do that work, it's for you to do it. And if God calls you to do it, that means he's equipped you to do the work. &gt;&gt; We cannot keep laying the same foundation. You are elected. You are called and you go out. Oh, praise God. And then you come back so you can hear the same sermon. No. God wants us to move forward. &gt;&gt; God wants a people that come to church, they know that I'm a believer. I've been calling this end time. I'm here to live the life of Christ. I'm here to manifest Christ in this generation and to know if God called me, nothing can stop me. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop me. I cannot even stop myself from it. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I said I was not going to preach. And I want to say this and and the footsteps that we make &gt;&gt; is leading us into that direction. And so therefore, we have to watch for our action. Let me say this. We live in such a most deceitful time that's ever been on the face. So people claim to be Christians, but yet when the word is preached, it pay they pay no respect to the word of God. that they hear the words of the prophet spoken to their ears, it means a zero into them. &gt;&gt; But yet they claim to be Christians. What a deceitful things. I'll tell you when the word is preached, I don't care if God uses a donkey. I don't care what he uses. If it's the word of God, I want something in my heart to say, "God, I want to obey your word." God is no respector of persons. and I try you. I believe you are not respected person because if you are then God will speak and you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; If you only wait for your favorite preacher to preach so you can believe it, you're going to miss it. If you only wait for that vessel that you believe that God has anointed for him to speak, God can use anybody. What we care is not the vessel. We care about the word of God being preached. And if it's in line with what the messenger said, we receive it. &gt;&gt; We live by it. We eat it. &gt;&gt; We we can't become the word unless we eat the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to say this and and so we as believers we have to uh uh to the the the the the we have to understand it's the the the more efforts or the the when we put all that we are into this goal &gt;&gt; into this objective that's how we get to the objective. It's not that God hasn't spoken, but there's that's the God part, but there's the man part that has to catch up with the promise. So, it's important when God has spoken, the believers has to believe. &gt;&gt; Your part is to believe what God has said. And then that's why the prophet say when God calls a man, he calls a Christian or a preacher, God doesn't make halfway preachers. But he says that a preacher or a man can be halfway. And the reason for the halfwayiness is because they don't believe. They don't surrender. So the believer's part is to surrender into everything that God is calling us to be. So we can be that. So the the resistance that we place in the doubting and all those things is just uh uh basically slowing down the progress &gt;&gt; for us to get to. There's nothing left. The prophet told us the word is here. The messenger has come. So you tell me what is it that we are waiting for? &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? So it's for us as believers of the end time to eat the word to in other way. Let me say this. It's for us to eat the revelation of the word. It's for us to eat the word and let the revelation of the word change us. &gt;&gt; It's not for a new preacher or somebody to come and put it in a way that you never heard it before. No. But it's for us to eat the word and be transformed into that word. Lay in the presence of the son and be baked so we can become in the image of what was spoken. &gt;&gt; Because you couldn't become unless the word was spoken first. But once the word is already spoken, it's as good as done. So it's for us to move into the finished product &gt;&gt; that has been spoken about us. The word is provided. God is calling us to lay in the presence of the son to attain the goal of the mature bride, the mature person, one who's going into the rapture. And that characteristics can only come, let me say this, it was not exclusively left up to the prophet. One of the things as believers we always have to take out of our mind but said that he even spoke about whatever prophet you call his name I'll tell you the prophet said he's a man just like you are &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you say Moses he says Moses was a man just like you David was a man just like you so it's not a man who fulfills the promise it's gods who fulfilled the promise the common characteristics with all those people is that they have believed the word for the time and they laid in the presence of that word until they became the promise what was spoken to them. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the word has the power of transformation. &gt;&gt; If God spoke a word, that word has the power to transform itself into what God wants it to be. So Moses banana moay he was called and in fact he was born with the equipment. &gt;&gt; Think about it born with the equipment. If you go back a little bit in that same message, but talk about the parents, Joabed and Hamraham, he said they pray, they will come and he will come back from work, they will lay there and they will pray, they'll pray until God spoke to them about the coming of a son. But said that that Moses was a proper son. He was one who was actually born for a job. He was one in his own birth. His coming into the world was coming with a purpose attached to his life. And let me say this, your coming into the world is with a purpose. Let me say this, the way that God deals with the prophet is the same way he deals with you. So if I can even take it back and say the very life of William Brandham, yes, an angel came at his birth. You probably didn't see an angel, but God ordained his life the same way that he ordained yours. There's no such a thing as a happen chance in the kingdom of God. Everything is pre-planned. Everything comes according to the plan of God. So when we read the Bible, that's why the prophet will tell us we're reading our own story. I am Abraham. I am Moses. &gt;&gt; There were types for us to look and see ourselves in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not say, well, it was Moses. No, put your name in the scripture. Understand that just like Moses, just like you, because God is not a respector. In fact, this God does one thing one way. He's obligated to do it the same way. That's how his believing children recognizes him. &gt;&gt; Now, we heard that here he was and his parents told him from a young age how that he was a proper child. How the story of how that they put him on the river and the crocodiles were full of children and they ate all the other children and the pro prophet will say the parents didn't fear and they let the baby go and the baby went and the baby was not eaten and he was saved. All of that they did it by faith because they had directly heard from God and they believed that God was going to spare this child. But let me say this, even with that, that was not enough for Moses to get the job done. &gt;&gt; You with me? Born with the equipment, heard from parents what he was supposed to do, but that was not enough for him to do the job. It was a good step, but it was not enough. I can say this, a preacher can stand here and say, "You are predestinated. You are predestinated." That is not enough for you to get the job done. Moses had to come in contact with the God who made the promise. &gt;&gt; Moses had to come in contact face to face with the only one who made the promise. So the one who made the promise can reveal himself to Moses. So you have to come, you can't say the prophet said the Bible said. You have to come in contact with the God of the Bible, with the God of the prophet. So you can know for yourself. The parents can tell you you are a good child. That's wonderful. That's not going to save you. &gt;&gt; It's just a step in the right direction. We need to come in contact with the God of this Bible. &gt;&gt; The one who sent the prophet, just the same way he spoke to the prophet, the same God will speak to you so you can know for yourself that you have been called. because that's the only thing that would make that word a reality &gt;&gt; is to come in contact with that same God. &gt;&gt; So there's not a an amount of intellect &gt;&gt; we can gather together, read the entire message or the entire Bible and then somehow change the intellect into revelation. No, it takes for you to meet the maker himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So your election is not a product of a preacher standing up and claiming you are elect and then you go home and you go sleep you say thank God I'm elected. I I I don't know about you but I just want to say this as a Christian and I said this before we have to have a curiosity &gt;&gt; about the things of God. There has to be a healthy e curiosity within your life. When you hear something, you just want to know for yourself. God, I don't understand you with the rock in the wilderness, the rock that brought water, the br that did this. I just don't understand. Can you just talk to me? I tell you, he loves that. &gt;&gt; He loves for you to know him yourself. He loves for him to reveal the scripture to you. Just like the the the the the disciples on the way of Emmas, he loves to fellowship with his children. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; I think I need to stop. I &gt;&gt; we're going to have &gt;&gt; we we will continue another time. And and if you try to do it your own way, &gt;&gt; you'll get the same results that Moses got. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you try to live Christian life &gt;&gt; based on what you heard somebody say, what you what you read in the Bible yourself without the contact, &gt;&gt; you will produce the same result that Moses produced. What we need is to hear the word, go on our knees and make contact with the creator. Say, Lord, I heard that if I call upon the name of the Lord, I shall be saved. Now, I heard it from a preacher. I heard it from a pastor. I even heard it from the messenger. Now I'm here that you can take what I heard and make it a reality. God walks us with his children by revelation and by reality. In fact, but I'm saying this because that happened, Moses all of the sudden esteemed the reproach of Christ. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Better than all the greatness of Egypt. Amen. &gt;&gt; You think a man can do that? &gt;&gt; Now, I I think you got to go back and read what was the grad of Egypt to understand where Moses was. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You You can't forsake the world by your own self. &gt;&gt; You You cannot change, turn around, unless you need something that's better. You can't. You lying to yourself. Come in contact with this Jehovah and let him make himself known unto you. That's what the real change comes from. That's how you live the drugs and the things and the lying. That's how you desire God is by coming in contact with our God. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's not by what some preacher said somewhere. It's not by you just saying, "Oh, this sounds like it's interesting. I want to find out." No, you got to go and make contact. &gt;&gt; That's what changes the heart. &gt;&gt; One who was in the greatness of Egypt than everything that he could look for. In fact, all he had to do was just wait couple of years and it will be a pharaoh and it will take the children of one who knew the might of what Egypt represented. But it's this heain that reproach of Christ when he come in contact with that pillar of fire when he contact when he can make contact with the burning bush it changed his life forever &gt;&gt; and let me say that we are not spared from that &gt;&gt; we we do and I won't even speak to myself there's a lot of things that we know that's just still intellectual understanding and and and that's fine you know We even preach about it, we scream about it, and we rejoice over it. But brothers and sister, let's move into that place where it could become a reality. Where those things that we know about the bride coming of Christ, about Jesus manifested in the bride. Father, I hear this. I hear the prophet talk about all of this thing. And I love it with all my heart, but I need it to become a reality somehow. I want to look at my own life and see Jesus Christ manifested. I want to look at my own life and see Christ walking in the midst of it. &gt;&gt; That's the objective that produces the rapture. &gt;&gt; Any other objective will gather up a bunch of knowledge and you know certainly you could build a kingdom off of it &gt;&gt; but it's not going to enter you in there. The objective that gets you in there is to come under the shed blood and to say, "Father, you've provided a way and I want to live by that way." &gt;&gt; But Ram said, "What Moses lack the burning bush had." &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, what we lack as a reality of God, this message has it. &gt;&gt; Not just the message in in words, but the message in the spirit. I was talking to my father-in-law. I said, "What I've seen most of the time happen at the same time." People, we have embraced the message of William Brandham, but we've left the spirit of it out. &gt;&gt; We we've taken the doctrines and just ran away with it. My we could explain the son of man and we could talk and just have everybody standing up, but the spirit of it is nowhere to be found. Otherwise, it wouldn't create division. &gt;&gt; The division comes when there's a bunch of men's idea inserted in there. &gt;&gt; If we could just stick with what he said, it wouldn't produce any division. If we can just remove ourselves from the picture, it wouldn't create a problem. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be seen. Oh, I know something. We don't nothing. &gt;&gt; We know nothing. He died for us. Have you ever died for somebody? &gt;&gt; He gave his life so we can have this. &gt;&gt; The prophet gave up so much so we can have this. What did you give up? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I I really I'm trying hard. I'm sorry. Forgive me. So he esteemed the reproach of Christ better than the riches in the glory of Egypt. And I want to say this, no man can come to that conclusion until they've met the master himself. &gt;&gt; Until they've met the maker himself. Because only the maker had better than what Egypt could offer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There was no other kingdom on earth that could offer something that Moses can look and compare and say, "I'll leave this one and I'll follow the other." The equipment said one place he said God is wanting us to use what's inside of us. He's not wanting us to go and create something new. and I'm just paraphrasing or try to walk by some thinking somewhere. The only way we can achieve this is by realizing I have been elected and called and I have been commissioned. I am just walking in this. I don't care whether you have understanding or no understanding but I'm just walking in obedience to what he has given me. &gt;&gt; Now we have people that are so smart they can even correct the prophet. They can even say what the prophet didn't mean to say or forgot to say. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; What foolishness. &gt;&gt; You know, I feel like saying like what what what what what God told when he came to Miriam. He said, "You tell me when I came, I gave this message. Did I come talk to you? &gt;&gt; Tell me which of these men did I come talk to?" It said, "But Moses, my servant, I speak to him lip to ear." &gt;&gt; What's wrong with just humbling ourselves and saying that the prophet saying that's what we're going to follow? &gt;&gt; There can't be two leaders. There's only one. &gt;&gt; The musician could come. I'm sorry. I'm just going to keep going. I know we have communion. We'll continue another time. Amen. If the brothers could get ready. I get I guess I suffer from the preacher syndrome. When you open it, you say it's small and it gets bigger and bigger. But we thank God for it. Amen. Man, let's turn. We're going to read a scripture for communion. Man, let's just remember our pastor. I talked to him this afternoon. They finished the meetings in Congo. Uh tomorrow, bright early in the morning, they're going to be flying to Harare, Zimbabwe, uh for the next round. And we just pray that the Lord will strengthen him. It's a very early flight. It's really like, you know, the very early. So we just pray that God will strengthen them that they can go over and uh and and preach those uh services over there. May let's turn our Bibles to uh 1 Corinthians chap 11 verse 20 the 23rd verse. A very familiar scripture reading and certainly appreciate everybody coming into the house of God for communion. Amen. I trust this is what will move us forward. Amen. This is this is our objective. If rapture is our objective, we observe all the commandments. If if God says it, I want to be like Peter said, "I don't understand what you say, but one thing I know is you have the words of eternal life." That's that's I just want to be the dumbest believer that they could be. One who just believed because they heard because I know he brings understanding as we work along. He says, "For I have received of the Lord that which I have delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. Do this this do in remembrance of me." And after the same manner, he also took the cup when he had stopped, saying, "This cup is the new testament of my blood. This do ye as often as ye drink, drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's uh death till I till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let every man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily, eateth and drinkketh damnation unto himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come to eat together to eat, tar one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, and let and that ye come not to uh together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Amen. Let's just pray over the communion. Our gracious father, we so thankful for your grace and your mercy. Lord, we certainly just find how small we are when we stand in front of a God such as you. We are so humbled by the things that you do and your greatness, oh God. And father even as the prophet will say even the angels are dirty before you Lord. And you are three times holy. And father when you speak you speak only the truth. When you speak you speak life father. And as your believing children because of that understanding we take every word that you say just as life. We don't question it. We don't try to understand it. We just take it. And we know that you will give us the understanding when we need it. Even as our brother Matthew preached, when we get to it, you will reveal it to us. We ask that you bless this communion. Father, the bread that represents your body. Father, I heard your prophet say that there's healing in communion. Father, there's deliverance in communion. Father, I believe with all my heart that we can take it tonight. And Father, every sickness represented in this place will go away. that every need, everything represented in this place that we'll go out of here better than the way we came, Father, because we've taken off your communion. We ask you bless it, Father. The blood that represented the very stimulation of rea revelation, Father, as we take it, may you just come, oh God, and fulfill your word in us. We pray, Father, that if there be one here that feels unworthy, Father, only you can make worthy. Father, we as humans, we have no ability even to clean our own selves. All we rely on is the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. And Father, you said in your word that we have to come by faith because that's the only way you can accept us. Faith is the only thing that pleases you. And I pray tonight, Father, that we can come and Lord and not to clean ourselves, but you clean us and you make us ready for what we have need of. Lord, bless this as we take it, Lord. Everyone that will put his hand in here, Father, bless him. Those that feel like they couldn't put their hands in here. Father, I pray that you deal with their heart and you reveal yourself to them until they clean their life and feel worthy enough to come to the table to eat of your bread. Take this part of the service into your hands. We commit it to you and ask this, Lord, knowing that miracles and things will be worked out out of this because you said when we do your word, Father, that you will come and manifest the supernatural in our midst. We commit it and ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
