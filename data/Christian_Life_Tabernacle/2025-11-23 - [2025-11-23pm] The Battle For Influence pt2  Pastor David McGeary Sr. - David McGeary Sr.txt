Description:
The Battle For Influence pt2
Pastor David McGeary
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 23rd, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

You know, I like that when Moses gets in that sway, you know, I mean, a brother told me that I was African. So, you know, uh I like that it's in my blood, my eternal blood &gt;&gt; that come from my father above, right? That flows from the throne. Let's approach him. Our father, we [music] love you tonight. [snorts] We appreciate your presence, &gt;&gt; Father. We appreciate the freedom that we have in Christ Jesus. The liberty that your spirit [music] gives us to praise you and worship you, Father, that our hearts don't [music] condemn us, &gt;&gt; Lord. That we know that your blood has cleansed us, Father, that when we do fall, we cry out to you, Aba, Father, [music] and you're just and faithful to forgive us and restore us back. We love you for this, Father. [music] Father, and what that you've given us, Lord, we want to share. &gt;&gt; We want to share what you've done for us with others. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We want to be able to tell them with conviction in our heart how you've delivered us from bondage, how you've delivered [music] us from bitterness, how you've delivered us from oppression and depression, Father, and and all the abilities and wonders that you have for those that will believe in you, Father. [music] Stir up our hearts. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. If you have our Bibles, let's turn over to Mark uh the 16th chapter of the Gospel of St. Mark. And uh and we'll read those uh scriptures there. I believe they're found in uh Mark 16, the 16th chapter of the book of St. Mark. And u starting with the 15th verse and and we like to read this scripture and again in Mark 16:15. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." Go into all the world and influence every creature. And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe in thy name. They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. and say it shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless us in your precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Just a a little seated certainly. And uh so we understand that uh it's uh definitely uh written that uh Jesus wanted us to have influence. &gt;&gt; You that that's what he commissioned his disciples. He says now you've got it but I don't want it here. Go out and share it. you know, go out and influence others, tell them all the things that you've heard and all the things you've experienced. You know, that's uh you know, so many times we think that we've got to, you know, bring all of our doctrines or all of our teachings or or everything. No, you know, just tell them how your candle got lit. you know, share for them and and witness to them what's real uh to you. And so we've been talking a little bit about influence and and so this morning we mostly emphasize on the fact try to emphasize on the fact that we're influenced and uh you know so uh you know that's that's an important thing because we find out and we heard that somebody's watching you. Somebody watches the way you dress. Somebody uh watching what you say. They watch how you handle things. And and so we wanted to become conscious o of what influences and we uh we brought up a few questions that we should ask. Where does it come from? Where did this start? Uh when did this trend start? Uh what what was the purpose of it? What was the motivation of it? And uh you know and so to uh in the morning I mentioned a little bit on the lines of you know [clears throat] why high high heels where did they come from and the purpose of them when they were brought into fashion what their purpose was and it was to help uh correct give like a a a sex appeal and and and [clears throat] so when you see that you don't try to defend herself. &gt;&gt; You understand that that was an influence that was uh that was imposed upon you. &gt;&gt; You understand? And what happens is once it becomes the trend and it becomes acceptable and it becomes the norm and now everybody does it. [clears throat] That's not what determines whether something is right or not. whether everybody does it, you know what I mean? And [clears throat] I didn't get a chance this morning to get uh you know to bring up jewelry and makeup and and and all the other things that that that you can go you know and and you know and I always you know thought you know that that people they why would they paint their face you know why would they spend hours I think I I I don't go I don't use makeup. But I think that first of all they they have to lay a base or something and then after they base themselves up and then they got to add color and they they you know always scared me to death. I'd go down the road and there'd be some lady in the mirror going you know what I mean? Or have a pencil. You know what I mean? What are they what what is it that they're trying to alter? &gt;&gt; Okay. What what look &gt;&gt; are they trying to achieve? You know what what is that influence? Because influence from the outside if it influences you and it has an effect on you, right? So that's what influence is, right? the ability to uh have power on somebody to affect or change their thinking, to change their actions, to change their beliefs. So influence affects change. So if something can influence you and change you now it's changed your influence because somebody's watching you &gt;&gt; and and that's what happens and people want to succumb to the norm. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But what they want to succumb to that. So we want to uh [clears throat] talk about uh two things uh to this evening in our Bible study today. Uh we [clears throat] want to talk about what will influence and what will kill influence. And the prophet of God makes this statement here. It says we are here to influence. &gt;&gt; So you you can't you can't say, "Well, I'm just going to get away from influence. I'm I don't care what people think." You know, that's a big one, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I don't [clears throat] care what people think. That's not scriptural. Jesus wanted to know what they thought of him. &gt;&gt; Who do men say that I am? And they say, "Well, some say you're this, some say you're that. Some say you're something other than that." He says, "But who do you say I am? &gt;&gt; What kind of influence have [clears throat] I had on you, the ones whom I've chosen?" &gt;&gt; Now that [clears throat] this evening when I say that you are the chosen and elect of God, &gt;&gt; so you've been chosen to hear this message. &gt;&gt; So it's a good question. What kind of influence is this message having on you? &gt;&gt; I mean, if we're all trying to defend our our natures and we're trying to defend our cultures and we're trying to defend our education and we're trying to defend our actions, then it's not speaking too highly of what effect the message has had on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we what influence Jesus wants to know and Peter his he was so influenced he said well your influence on us is that thou art the Christ &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; And he said Peter flesh and blood have not revealed this to you &gt;&gt; but my father have showed you this. But again, Peter heard Jesus say, "I do nothing till the father shows me first. I'm about my father's business." So they watched him and he had influence on them. They watched when he he brought they Jesus was always being tempted. &gt;&gt; He was always being accused of the devil. You know, they always being called Beelzeub. And and they watched how he handled it. They said, "You are be elabub. You are the devil." He said, "Is a kingdom divided against itself?" You know, if I was a devil, then why am I doing good? You know, a divided kingdom can't stand. You know, he he they they they watched him when they brought the coin to them and said, "Oh, should we pay taxes?" You know who was it better for us to give tribute to God or give tribute to to to Caesar? &gt;&gt; You know, we have this idea that Jesus just walked around just, you know, doing miracles here and miracles there and his life was just rosy. The scripture said he didn't even have a place to lay his head. He was an outcast. &gt;&gt; He was criticized. So they they'd always are trying to trap him. who's and and they watched him sit back. He didn't sit there and argue and scream and he just simply said, "Give me a coin." Whose image is on the coin? Caesars. He says, "Okay." That's his. Give him his. &gt;&gt; But then he comes back. He says, "But give God his &gt;&gt; which is his commandments." &gt;&gt; So he was always they they were able to watch his influence. and and he had influence because he kept the word of God. &gt;&gt; He went into the temple on the Sabbath. You understand? So you can imagine that he had a life that went along with his gospel. &gt;&gt; I always say it this way to myself. Jesus practiced what he preached. So if he said to for us to forgive 70* 70, then I know that he forgives 70* 70. I know that he's just and faithful to forgive our sins if we would confess our sins. He even prayed, "Our Father, which are in heaven, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us." How many times in in the [clears throat] disciples lives watching the life of Jesus did they did he forgive? &gt;&gt; How how many situations was he put in? How many places in the scripture did they bring him into a meeting or into a a a dinner just to mock him? &gt;&gt; And then he had said, "Simon, I have something against you. You invited me here, but you didn't even wash my feet. &gt;&gt; You know, I've got something against you. But this lady, &gt;&gt; they watched him stand for her &gt;&gt; because she stood for him. &gt;&gt; They they saw that and Jesus said that if you stand for me here on earth, I'll stand for you before my father. But they watch that. They they they witnessed that &gt;&gt; in his life. So we have a stories written here of Jesus. But this this was a life lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand it was a life practice. He practiced what he preached. &gt;&gt; So he he was in all the circumstances. He he he was tempted. The the writers wrote it this way. He was tempted in every way that we were tempted. And yet he sinned not. &gt;&gt; They Can you imagine? I I just The only thing I ever thought was if they really knew who he was and what they were seeing. &gt;&gt; But he lived the life. &gt;&gt; You understand? He practiced the life. and and and so we're we're here to influence. So So what are what are the things that will influence? Because we want to be careful how we're influenced because if something changes us then it changes our influence and we want to be changed to be more like him. So, our influence is more like him. And we want to be conscious of that. That was just going over this morning. We want to be conscious of two things. That we're being influenced and that we're influencing. &gt;&gt; So, when our influence, what influences us changes us, it changes how we're influencing. There's no way around that &gt;&gt; there. There's no way around it. I always tell you the story about the the the cars salesman. I went to buy a truck and and and I said, "Well, I'm thinking of a Dodge or a Ford, you know, and the guy just said, "Ah, you don't want a Dodge, you know, and I mean, they're expensive and they're rough and just rip Dodge, you know, just so I mean, you know, I mean, he made Dodge sound like you you drive a Dodge, you know, you're just a I had to get a Ford. Well, you know, so looking around, I I went over to the Dodge dealership and there he was selling Dodges. I said, "Oh." He says, "Well, yeah, yeah. I found out them Fords were no good and and Dodges is the truck, you know, and I thought, well, why, you know, Ford's the most sold truck in America, you know, there's got to be some reason for the switch, right? It had to start someplace. And so you you begin to understand that his now his whole influence changed. &gt;&gt; And so it's important. So what is one of the very first things that will influence and that's the ability to reach across differences. Brother Benham says it he says it this way. He says, "We are here to influence and we'll never be an influence to the outside world as long as we're trying to influence them to some organization because they've been that before we we were born. You understand? So it it's not the influence of trying to get them to see see it your way. &gt;&gt; You understand that? That doesn't create an influence. That creates a resistance. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You're automatically in combat mode. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And we don't want to be in combat mode. That we're we're not here to prove anybody wrong. We're not here to decize anybody. So, we're talking about our fluence. What What is it that we can possess to influence others? And and that's the ability to to lay aside the difference and find that common ground. &gt;&gt; Find that find that thing that you can talk about. Set aside the differences, you know, and and and that'll influence. But you know how some people if they don't believe the way you believe, you treat them like poison. I mean, you almost it's it's almost like they don't believe the way you do. They come from a different thought or maybe even within the framework of the message, a different trend in the message, and all of a sudden you you feel like you got the creepy jebies. Anybody know what the creepy jebies are? You ever got that real funny feeling around somebody? You know, like there's just, you know, you're all you're all weary and everything. They're not going to hurt you. You understand what are are we you you can't reach across the aisle if you're afraid of their influence. &gt;&gt; If you're afraid to listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I got I've got a good friend who's a he he's a a Muslim and he's my soil engineer and they they sell they celebrate uh Ra Ramadama or forgive me if I say that wrong, but that's a time, you know, they fast during the day and then and I bring them a gift and I know it's part of their faith to share their faith and [snorts] I listen to them tell me about about uh his religion and about his faith and and if I show up in his office, no matter how busy he is, I just say, "Tell Sam it's it is David McGary." And you'll hear him say, "Send them in." [snorts] And he'll set all his papers down. He'll quit everything he's doing because he knows I'm going to listen to him. &gt;&gt; And he wants to share his faith. And you know, he tells me about how that they they how they pay their tithing and and and and [snorts] I listen &gt;&gt; and I I'm and at least I keep the door open. &gt;&gt; Have I been successful in changing them? No. &gt;&gt; Not yet. &gt;&gt; But I like that word. &gt;&gt; So you you you can't shut the door. You've got to reach across the aisle. And so this is what he says. So we're talking about what will influence. He says he says we'll never we'll never we'll never influence them trying to get them to some organization because they've already been that. So we're not going to influence them trying to change them. But let us stand for God &gt;&gt; and his word and fellowship and get all brethren. Let's not draw a line and say if you don't tow it to this, let's reach across the line and be brethren. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a way to have influence. You can't treat people like they're poison. &gt;&gt; Poison ivy. You know what I mean? You you you you can't be afraid. And so that's one way that that uh we want to do it. He says, "Now, let's watch what our influence is." So, we want to know what it is that we're trying to influence. So, in order to be effective in influencing, you've got to know what it is you're trying to bring them to, &gt;&gt; what it is you're trying to influence. Watch your influence. Is really our influence should be the love of God. &gt;&gt; That God so loved us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That he took the penalty of sin. He so loved us. He was there when we were in the time of struggle. He so loved us that he reached out his hand of grace and mercy. We should know a God that we're representing you. It's not representing your or when brother Bram says organization. What he's saying is you're not representing your creeds, your thinking, your doctrine, your ideas. You're representing him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That what we represent. That's what it's the source of our influence. Watch what our influence is. Watch what our source of influence is. We're not trying to get people on our side &gt;&gt; or in our church. We're trying to get them to a bornag again experience of the Lord Jesus Christ that does something for somebody &gt;&gt; and brings the joy of the Lord singing in their heart &gt;&gt; and and then so that that's what will influence &gt;&gt; another thing that will influence is is is he says that's the main being influenced not by what great numbers are, but what a great God that you're representing. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That great God that you're representing. Not by numbers, not by this. That won't influence anybody. You can say, "Well, we've got this many people coming or we've got this or we Well, the Catholics will look at you and say, you got how many? Two million believers, three million, four million believers. We got 600 million believers in the United States alone. That's not what influences them. You know what I mean? That that's not what it is. It it's it's what a great God we're representing. It's what we're representing is what influences somebody. Like if somebody like we talk about they're representing a product. I I I I'm sure brother Jonathan would would represent his product. Well, I I think it's it's mobile. I think he's mobile Greece or whatever. I'll guarantee you he let you know that mobile Greece is the Greece he represent and he's fortified with specs with tests with testimonies. He he's representing something that's a proven product. Not that other pro products aren't equal. If the products are equal, his service is better. &gt;&gt; He's better looking than that other salesman. Whatever. You know what I'm saying? But it's what you're representing what influences people. You're not going to you're not going to uh uh represent something that doesn't work &gt;&gt; or is no good. &gt;&gt; That's like that truck salesman. He had lost all his all of his influence because he didn't know what he was representing. &gt;&gt; I knew what he was representing. He was representing whatever paycheck he could get. &gt;&gt; But you understand, you're representing something that that's what makes your influence &gt;&gt; strong and you you're called to influence. So it it and he says and so that that's what does it is when you have that influence and you have that influence when you're representing a God that we're representing. You'll have influence when you're representing God. And it goes on to say, "And the kind of life that is in us by him that will influence others." &gt;&gt; The ability to reach across. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Forget the differences. &gt;&gt; You're representing God &gt;&gt; and you have a life in you that's bearing witness to that. that that creates the ability to represent and and that that's that will influence others and then we must never forget that we are the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; So another thing that causes influence is to be salty &gt;&gt; and and that means to make contact you got to make contact &gt;&gt; with a person. I like the when brother Ram the the the in Mexico when the man came up and and he saw the man and the first thing in his heart he thought well this could be my father. He was making contact. He he he's having sympathy. He he was interested in making contact. He wasn't interested in just making a statement. just not tooting your horn. This is what I believe. Let me tell you what I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe you're wrong. I believe you're an error. I believe you don't interpret the Bible. Well, you're not trying to make contact with that person. In fact, you're pushing them away. &gt;&gt; You're trying to get them to a belief. All these little things tie together. It's a whole approach. It's a whole atmosphere. In fact, really what it is should be in us is the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So, we're salty. And that means to make contact, make contact with their feelings, &gt;&gt; make contact with their troubles, &gt;&gt; make contact with what their needs are. The scripture says you can't bid somebody's God's speed and send them away hungry. &gt;&gt; Well, if you're salty and you make contact, they've got to see you're interested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I appreciate Jehovah's Witness in their effort that they go doortodoor, but they're not doing that to me. They're putting in their hours. &gt;&gt; Because the more hours they put in, the higher their position in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; It's the way they're taught. But thank God they're doing that. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But you're never going to get them anywhere with arguing with them. &gt;&gt; If you ever do, invite them and ask them, "Is there any sick people in your family? Do you have any trouble with your teenagers? How's your marriage? &gt;&gt; Oh, now you're caring for them. &gt;&gt; Oh, you haven't. Let Let me Let me pray. You know, our Lord Jesus can do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think. It don't hurt to pray for people. &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Get involved. Oh, that's great. I'm I'm not going to argue with your doctor, but we both are trying to serve a God. &gt;&gt; Now, let our God manifest. &gt;&gt; Let me pray for you. You need to go and you pray for one of them and they get well. &gt;&gt; Remember brother Bram's next door neighbor? He's a Jehovah witness till brother Brandham prayed for his family. Then things changed. So you you see these are the things that make you have influence. But if you're in a if you're a little bulldog and you're fighting and you're arguing with doctrine and you're arguing with religion and you're arguing with that and you're arguing that you'll never you'll never get anywhere. And if and all that's going to do is is hurt you. So you've got to be salty. And and and salty means to is to be make contact to be really interested in their soul in their well-being. These are the things that the prophet of God tells us that will give us. And then being humble and not self-exalted. Those are the things that give us influence and that's what we want to have. And I'll I'll tell you, I've talked to a lot of the people that that were in Brother Bram's meetings that uh that uh had brother Brandham preach for them. And that's the one thing that he did. He was so humble. You know what I mean? And even even when he talked about the Godhead explained and how he told them all those rooms and where everybody would be and how this band would play in here, brother Ben Renham lays the story out like you know I really he laid it on him so sweet, so humble and I always thought of the story and and I I was fortunate enough to talk to Billy Paul about it and other people that were there when that man stood up. Brother Brandham standing right behind the curtain right about where that piano on this side piano and the man stands up there and says, "I'm sorry, brother Bram can't speak to us this afternoon. He got called out on a sick call and him standing right there and and I remember talking to that story and and he said the brother said to me, he said, "Well, you know who that was, don't you?" and he began to tell me the story and then he would never the other brother said brother Bam why don't you go out there the brother that said why don't you go out there and let him know the brother that told asked brother Bram that told me brother Ram turned to him and said I would never do that to hurt that brother's influence &gt;&gt; that's why brother Brennham had influence because he stood for the word of God. You want to have influence. Don't shun away from your influence because if you shun away from your influence, you're shunning away from your duty to God. Remember the little logging boy? He was going up to the log camp and his mama said to him, he says, "Oh, if you go up there, it's really rough. You know what I mean? They're going to treat you bad. They're going to make fun of your religion." And then he went up there and he come back and his mama said, "Son, how did they treat you when they found out you were a Christian?" He said, "Don't worry, mama. They never found out. So don't shun your influence. Let's just take a little moment here if you don't mind. What will kill our influence? The things that kill our influence is not not standing not standing firm. He says, "And when we lose our influence as father, as mother, as Christian, as a businessman, as a minister, when we lose our influence with people, now we can be very popular in the line of the world and go along with the world." But I mean as what we represent, we represent Christ. So, it's the influence that we have for what we represent that we're talking about losing. Not your friendships, not those things, but we want to be influential in what we represent. And that's why so many times when people misinterpret the message of the hour or they put their own interpretation on it or they come up with things that they think brother Brandham's saying it it the influence leaves &gt;&gt; and they wonder why they can't spread the gospel. They wonder why there's just a few of them that believe that way. And and here's some of the reasons why. This is what he said. He said, he says, "But I mean as what we represent, oh Christ, when we lose our influence as that as standing out, we can't. How can we blend in with the day when God is against the day?" And so one of the reasons that we lose our influence is because we don't want to stand out. &gt;&gt; But you stand out. &gt;&gt; You can't help but stand out. Right. &gt;&gt; And and and that's not a bad thing to stand out &gt;&gt; when you have all the other parts of being fluential down. The right spirit, the right attitude, the right nature, the right objective, the right motive, the right representation, the life of God in you, you can't shun away from standing out. People lose their influence when they don't stand out. &gt;&gt; And I I looked a little bit about all these influencer. Everybody's got some sort of trick. I saw a picture of a guy and he's got uh jewelry coming down his nose like this on the side of his face and he wears great big long fingernails and he's got these big he wears earrings and and he's just, you know, all marked up and everything. What What's he trying to He's trying to stand out &gt;&gt; so he can influence. Right? &gt;&gt; And everybody's got some little show, some little gimmick, some way to stand out because you're if you don't stand out, you don't have any influence. Well, our standing out is standing out for what we believe. Standing out for Christ, standing out for keeping the principles, standing out being honest, standing out being kind, being friendly. But you stand out and you can't shun away from standing out or taking a stand. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. You got to be wise. &gt;&gt; There's a a season and a time for everything. &gt;&gt; I don't think you ought to testify on somebody else's money. I go on jobs and my workers, they'd be I said, "Well, you didn't get nothing done." "Oh, but I was testifying." "No, you weren't testifying. You were robbing me. You know, if I I wanted to pay you to testify, I'd have sent you for seminary." Don't testify on the job. Work. &gt;&gt; Let your light shine. Stick to your duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a time and a season for everything. You know what I mean? But when you're faithful on the job, you're faithful to that boss. You're serving that person that gives you that paycheck at lunch break. If you want to testify, fine. But don't burn up somebody else's time. It won't have any influence. The guy that's watching you, he knows what you're doing. You think, "Oh, I'm testifying." I know he's saying this guy's a feather better. He'd rather talk than work. [snorts] You know, it's hard to make a stand, but you got to stand the prophet of God. You got to stand out that you represent Christ. You don't represent him in the way the world does. We don't represent Christianity the way the world represents Christianity. [snorts] And I can name a lot of famous people uh great quarterbacks and people that they they'll come up and they're they're they'll they'll come right up and say uh they maybe they win the World Series and they'll get on the mic and say, "The first thing I want to do is give all the glory to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." You know what I say to that? Amen. He deserves all the glory. I'm not opposed to that. I'm not going to get ruined my day because somebody doesn't believe the message the way I believe and I can't rejoice with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel what God's given me is better than any World Series. Would I trade this for a World Series? Would I trade this for a Super Bowl? I wouldn't trade what God's done for me for nothing. &gt;&gt; But you you you lose your influence when you lose the ability to stand out. And that's what he says. when you don't represent when we lose our influence as that as standing out. So when you lose that influence of what you represent, that's another thing. The other thing that that kills your your influence is pride. That that's that's uh one of the the things that that happens is when you get lifted up. He says the way up is down. How do we know which way is up or down? [snorts] Oh, that I've I've read that for years. I just love it because he says because the world stands in space. How do you know which way is up or down? How many believe the South Pole is down? No, it's not. The South Pole is up and the North Pole is down. What side of the equator you on? You know, water in the sink goes one way on one side of the equator and the opposite way on the other side of the equator. Tell me, explain now which is right and which is left. &gt;&gt; I remember I had lunch with brother Tim one day and he was he was explaining to me how those nuclear submarines the earth has a magnetic field and they can get right in those magnetic field lines and absolutely been totally hidden because of the magnetism of the earth. And then he looked across the table and says, "I've given you the secrets. Now I'm now I'm going to have to kill you." &gt;&gt; There's a way to know &gt;&gt; the up that we want is up in him, &gt;&gt; up in his nature, up in his spirit, up in his life. So I just thought that was always interesting. He says he says which way is up or down. So always don't don't miss those little things. So always what does always mean? It means always. &gt;&gt; He that humbleth himself, God will exalt. &gt;&gt; All ways. He that exalts himself, God will bring a to a God will bring to a base. &gt;&gt; He will bring him down. Always keep humble and be little in your own sight. &gt;&gt; Be little in your own sight. Know that everything you have is because of him. No matter what God does for you, just see how much more humbler you can be all the time. The more God blesses you, just keep getting more humble all the time. He can continue to bless. But when you get to the place you think I've got it, &gt;&gt; you haven't got it and you're on your road out. That's right. See, you lose your influence. You lose your strength of your testimony. There's nothing that turns somebody off but somebody that thinks that they've got it. &gt;&gt; They can be right and you ain't gonna take it. &gt;&gt; You are, you know, especially men that male ego just goes to battle. You know what I mean? You come on to somebody like I've got it, you ain't. They're ready to fight &gt;&gt; that that minute that pride steps in. I've got this revelation. I see this message. I believe it that way. I I've got something you ain't got. You're on your way out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You might as well just stop and look at that guy and say, "You're out." &gt;&gt; Because you're on your way out. You've lost your influence. &gt;&gt; You're out. You're out of his life. &gt;&gt; You're out of his door. He's closing the door to you. &gt;&gt; You've ended it right there. There's nothing that that that kills influence more than than uh than lack of humility. &gt;&gt; Just a uh any type of prideful attitude will just uh uh immediately take something. &gt;&gt; So, you've got to know that God has ordained certain things to be done and it must be done that way. And we're not to inject our own ideas. We're to represent his ideas and his commandments. So, the minute you get to where you think you're re you're injecting something or you've got something to do and you lose that humility. You've lost your influence. You say, "Why are you saying this?" Because the whole purpose that we started this year was to get a path forward to turn our hearts from arguing about differences in the message to whether who's got the Holy Ghost and who doesn't have the Holy Ghost. I know one thing. If you've repented of your sins and you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I can't educate you in it. I can't browbeat you in it. &gt;&gt; You're going to get the Holy Ghost one way or the other. You can do it two ways. You can spend months and months crying at the altar, give me the Holy Ghost. Give me the Holy Ghost. You'll get it. Or you can sit in your seat and say, "God promised me the Holy Ghost. I'm going to get it." &gt;&gt; Both ways will get you there. &gt;&gt; But faith is the best way. &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, I think it's the fastest way. &gt;&gt; He said, "So that settled it. I meant the requirements. I'm going to get it." &gt;&gt; And it's a mystery how you can have the Holy Ghost without sensation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was in a swap meet one day walking down and I got in the section. I was looking at all the army badges and all the buttons and everything and I I just remembered I've been burdened and bothered by his spirit for a very long time and all of a sudden I noticed it was gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the middle of a swap mate. It one of the very few times I've ever been down to Trader Village. [snorts] I don't like the name of that place. You know, Trader Village. It's where all the traders go. Not that kind of trader, but you know what I mean. I I just remember it. It came in his season. &gt;&gt; You believe God. And that's why we keep saying don't put faith in the accusations. [snorts] Accusations of Satan [clears throat] about you are trying to influence you. Because if he can influence you, it changes your influence. &gt;&gt; If he can get you to say, "I don't have the Holy Ghost. I need the Holy Ghost." That influence has a whole different effect than saying, "I'm going to get the Holy Ghost. I'm promised the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I believe it's real &gt;&gt; and I believe it's mine to have &gt;&gt; and I believe the spirit of God's going to come on me. I believe the love of God is going to be a shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm going to love my neighbor. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm going to be able to turn the other cheek. I believe I'm going to be able to go the extra mile. I believe I don't have to worry about whether I'm going to be fed because the righteous shall never bake bread. And it's a whole different influence when you take the influence of God's word over the accusations of Satan. But if you believe the accusations of Satan, you're giving life to that influence. &gt;&gt; And we read it this morning. First of all, it's got to be believed in your mind. And you've got to accept it in your mind. Right? &gt;&gt; That's where the battle is. &gt;&gt; So you first of all, you've got to accept the accusation that you're a devil sinner &gt;&gt; in your mind. &gt;&gt; And then when you accept it in your mind, then you believe it with your heart &gt;&gt; and it gains life. &gt;&gt; The same things with the promises &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; God said you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place. Sing says, "Yes, you do. I got it right here on my record." December 1971, July 23rd, that guy pulled in front of you on the road and you cussed him out. &gt;&gt; No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you didn't. &gt;&gt; Find it, Satan. He said, "Well, it's on my record. Your record isn't zipped to me. &gt;&gt; It's it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; And God don't even remember it." &gt;&gt; Who you going to believe? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, so that it's so important what's influencing you &gt;&gt; because what's influencing you affects your influence on others. &gt;&gt; And so we want to we don't want to we don't want to kill influence. And what kills influence is not standing out. If you're just like everybody else blending into the world, running with the crowd, the prophet of God says no influence for the cause of Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't care about worldly influence. &gt;&gt; We're talking about godly influence. &gt;&gt; He said he he says you don't stand out. If you're proud and you lack humility and you're arrogant, that just shuts it down. &gt;&gt; I I just can't even comprehend how humble Jesus must have been. &gt;&gt; Why if no wonder he said power apart from character is satanic. I would hate to think think if if I was, you know, what I would have done before I was a Christian. Let's put it that way. Because I would have taken my little finger and just zapped them. Zip. Zip. Where's the Pharisee? We can't find him nowhere. Brother David turned him into a pile of ashes. Not Not Jesus. He forgave all their sins. Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. What humility, what compassion. In fact, the scripture says he humbled himself [cough] even under the death of the cross. &gt;&gt; So nothing kills your influence like pride and we we could read it here and and and we were we were reading it. He he says it'll bring them down. He says, he says you lose the strength of your testimony. So always be mindful of that. The other thing that that that kills our influence, he says, now referring back to our sisters, no matter what other women does, God has got your pattern in here. So you you can't you'll lose your influence if you break the pattern of the scriptures, &gt;&gt; which is what? When you're reviled, revile not. &gt;&gt; How many times do we someone accuses us and we immediately break into defense? &gt;&gt; And our defense becomes a trap. I'll tell you one of the greatest things that you can ever do if you're falsely accused is just said, you know something, you forgive me. I would never mean in my heart to hurt anybody. I'm sorry you misunderstand. I'll do my best to try to make sure that I'm not misunderstood again. Stay with the pattern. You got to stay with the scriptural pattern. People are reading this Bible. People know what a Christian should do. They know how they should act. You can't say one thing and live something else. It hurts your influence. It takes a long time. I've never been one that was ever able to make a good impression. So sometimes I would have to rely that I know in my heart that I I I I want to do right by somebody and if if you do it it'll it'll come out if you stay in the pattern. And I've told you the story of when I was in the supply house and it's I know this isn't about me but it means something to me is that when all of a sudden this great big guy come up. He's a big guy you know and I thought uh oh I must have parked in his spot or got his truck and he come over to me just sed up to me and looked at me and he said are you David McGary? And I said yes sir. I said, "I am." He says, "You don't remember me." He says, "But I've been looking for you for two years." I thought, "Oh, what have I done?" [clears throat] You know, I kind of moved a few steps back because I had to get about four steps back to see him eyes. You know what I mean? And he says, "You don't remember, but I was on the job with you at Texas Instruments." And he I just used the words he used, if you forgive me. He said, "We gave you literal hell out there." And I thought, "Well, it's no problem. I understand." And all of a sudden, this guy started balling, tears running down his face. And he said, "You know what?" He said, "I gave my heart to the Lord." and he's a youth minister now at a goodsized Baptist church in Berles. And he said, "I always I always wanted to find you and tell you how sorry I was." He wanted me to go down there and and and testify and and and everything. You know what I mean? And you say, "Well, what did you do?" I just tried to stay in the pattern. [snorts] I don't always in the pattern and when I get out of pattern I repent. &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, forgive me." But you'll you'll you'll lose your influence if you don't try to stay in the pattern. [snorts] You you understand you you can't you can't be one way one day &gt;&gt; and one way the other day. You can't be back and forth, in and out. [snorts] Influence is something that it's like character. It's earned in the fiery furnace of affliction. You earn your influence. Time after time after time, people see you acting in the same way. You don't leave a pattern. So, in order to have influence, you have to have a pattern. Timothy sp it this way. Lay for yourself a pattern of good works. Too many of our lives don't have a pattern. [snorts] We don't have a pattern of good works. We don't have a pattern of giving. [snorts] We don't have a we we're not loyal to a pattern. When we get when we get our income, whatever it is of God, we don't set our part for God a aside first. It's hit and miss. Maybe we give offerings and maybe if our rent is due and we can't make this bills, then we put things off. You know what I mean? We we don't have a pattern. And if you don't have a pattern and you don't stay with God's pattern, you've got an in you lose your influence. &gt;&gt; But you get a guy that's on the job when he says he'll be there. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; You walk into the doctor's office and you say, "I'm sorry. I'm a minute early." &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's hard. I get mad at doctors. I sit in that little jail cell for 35 minutes and I don't need a doctor. I need a psychiatrist. And he comes mosying in, you know, like who are you? You know, but you just sit back. No, how are you doing today? I guess you must really be busy to let me sit here 45 minutes. No, you just smile. You know what I mean? Thank you, doctor. Appreciate what you're doing and everything. What I really want to do is, doctor, I'm going to be there when you tell me to be there. If you're not there, you're paying me. Now, how much influence would I have on that doctor? &gt;&gt; Zero. But my doctor asked me what I preached, asked me how I going, sat down and talked to me because he lost his father just instantly out of the middle of nowhere and he was working it through because he feels the other doctors let him down. You understand? If you stay with the scriptural pattern, I'm not pointing to me. I'm just trying the I only got instances of influence that I might personally know about &gt;&gt; and I you know and I I'm telling you what I what I wanted to do. But sometimes what we want to do isn't according to the pattern of scripture. &gt;&gt; And if he can get you out of the pattern, he's done the very thing that Satan wants to do. And that's make the word of God of none effect. And you are the word of God for this age. &gt;&gt; It's word being revealed in word. &gt;&gt; It's what he says in the back of this book. And so we understand that. I'm I'm going to close and move on. In other words, you get out of the pattern. Get out of your calling [snorts] is is another thing. If you're called to do a certain thing, stay in your calling. You know, if you're called to testify, stay in it. Don't try to be something you're not. You You might not think it is, but it's the person on the outside. They can tell you right instantly how much hot air you've got coming out of you because you're out of your calling. You don't know what you're talking about. Have you ever met somebody who's an expert on everything? Let me tell you how to put that bolt on. Let me tell you how to move this machine. Let me tell you how to run this pipe. Let me tell you how to do this. They've always got a better way to do it. Influence is over. That person has zero influence. [snorts] Well, I was visiting with brother James Hayes and we were talking about a airplane. I think it was either Japanese or Korean airline. The pilot was driving the plane into the ground and nobody in the cockpit had the nerve to stand up and resist him when he was wrong. They didn't have any influence. They'd sold their influence out because It it just a tragedy. They had to re take all the pilots and everything and re educate them on the danger of unsafe and unprofessional patterns. You don't want to get in a pattern that's contrary to the word of God. You want to have influence, stay in the pattern of God's word. God will make sure you have influence. Satan's always looking for a reason to check you off. And then the other thing is don't get out of your calling. Stay where he put you. Stay in the realms he put you in. and your calling is wherever he called you. However he dealt with your heart. So that's an another great thing he says here. He says, "Now watch my brethren. Be careful there because no matter how much God has filled you with his spirit, how much that you have done and how well you've been blessed, you stay with the calling of God. That's another way you lose influence. And one of the last ways that we lose influence is not to take correction. &gt;&gt; Is not to take correction. [snorts] I preach about high heels and you're going to come back. Oh, that's culture. That's this. And he doesn't say anything about jewelry. I have a lot to say about jewelry. I don't believe in rings on your toes and bells in your nose. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I I I just don't believe in a lot of those things. You want to wear a brace. I don't believe in bracelets all the way up to your elbow. I can tell you all kinds of things that I believe. [snorts] telling my beliefs isn't what gives influence. [snorts] It's when you look at my wife and you see what how much jewelry does she put in? Huh? What what is the reflection? What is it? Each one of you have a standard. That's your standard to make. [snorts] The scripture says don't be adorned with things, &gt;&gt; you know, hair braided in. And now, you know, we we not used to do it, but now we find people got all kinds of like gold and silver and all kinds of stuff in their hair. And and what's happening? We leave the pattern and we don't take the correction. Well, you don't have to take the correction, but the price of it is losing your influence. Remember the boy in trial? And he he told the judge, he said, "Your honor, I want to stand on my record." [snorts] And the judge said, "That's a problem, son. You don't have a record. [snorts] You don't have a testimony. You don't have a pattern of good works. You don't have nothing. In other words, son, you got zero influence. [snorts] But if that guy would have stood up there and said, "I served 25 years in the military. I have a Purple Heart. I have a a gold star, silver star, I have the Congressional Medal of Honor. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry that I ran that stop sign. You know what that judge is going to do? Dismiss, sir. Thank you for your service. &gt;&gt; Well, we got a judge. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And if you got a record of good works, you got a record of service, you got a record of praying for your brother, you got a record of not being selfish, and you do something wrong, you know what the judge is going to do? I forgive you. thrown in the sea of God forgiveness. Go on my brother, remember it no more. &gt;&gt; But if you don't take correction, listen to what he says. You say, "Well, what do you mean leprosy?" Leprosy represents is a type rather of sin. Now listen. And when a man won't stand correction by the word of God, he is full of leprosy, blows up and carries on. What does you what do you do? You ruin your influence. [snorts] If you don't take correction, you ruin your influence. People [snorts] hear the correction. They know what's right. And they see you won't take it. And there's nothing that kills a man's influence like justifying sin. Justifying unbelief. I've talked to people whose doctrines are so off the word of God and they just sit there and they justify it. They won't take correction and pretty soon they lose all their power. They've lost all their influence because they won't take correction. If someone corrects you and you're not sure, I'll pray about it. [snorts] I got it laid on me the other night. I went [snorts] out to a bonfire and I I drove down there and I I didn't want to walk down there. I can't see very good at night. So I pulled down farther on the the grass and and down there and all of a sudden someone knocked on my window. They don't want us parking on the grass. Thank goodness I didn't know who it was. [snorts] But I know the first thing in my mind said, "Do you know who I am?" Well, they probably did. I could have said, "Well, I'll park here if I want to. In fact, I'll just drive right up to the bonfire. All that stuff &gt;&gt; is going in the battleground. You know who who are you to tell me where I can park? I don't know who you are, but when I find out, &gt;&gt; no. I said, "Oh, I'm sorry." And I got in my truck and I drove and I parked up and walked down. [snorts] You say that's little. Yeah, but it was correction. [snorts] I could have made that guy feel bad &gt;&gt; and I wanted it. &gt;&gt; But if you don't take correction, you lose your influence. So, can you imagine sitting in a congregation, the word of God comes forth, preaches against something that's sin, and the first thing you're out in the parking lot defending your position. You've lost it. Go on, live your life. [snorts] But you've lost your influence for the cause of Christ. All of our influence is what? For the cause of Christ, for the furtherance of the gospel. Correction alters your course. Correction influences you that your influence becomes greater. Really, correction is not about you doing the wrong. It's about the wrong. The influence the wrong in your life is having. The wrong is not even laid to your charge. Who can lay anything? I hope you're getting this. This is a deep revelation. &gt;&gt; So deep it seems shallow. It's the influence that he's they're trying to correct. The sin itself is in the sea of God's forgetfulness. But the action and the attitude is having influence. So the correction is everybody parks there but I park here. Bad influence. That's what the corrections for. It's to correct what you're doing and what your attitude is, what you're representing, how you're presenting yourself. Whether it's a bad spirit, whether it's anger, whatever it is, it's there to present itself to change your influence because you're going to be judged on the other side for your influence, your character, the light you shine, the path you showed. And so he goes on to say, like he said, it's leprosy. It blows up. What does it what does it do? Ruins your influence. Something happens. People knows and can tell the word that you're corrected by that you're not going to do it. Therefore, you ruin your influence. How important is the correction of the word of God? Who does he correct? Those he loves. &gt;&gt; See that? That's what I love about the gospel. We're all in the same boat. [snorts] It applies to me. It applies to you. It applies to all of us. There's no big eyes and there's only you. It's not what we can do. It's what God can do. It's not how great we are. It's how great he is. Everything gets back to the cause. Everything gets back to the purpose. Why do we do lay a pattern of good works? To glorify our father in heaven. Why do we forgive? Because it shows that we were forgiven. Everything is about glorifying him. And then the last thing I'll just put this maybe maybe not taking correction should be the last thing but the other thing is when you're always influenced by by the things that influence you keep changing. Brother Brandham puts it this way. He says that things he says that we got it the other fellow hasn't got nothing to do with it. That is being influenced by the higher ups. Many times we get influenced by what in our mind we think is the higherups, the people with influence, the ministers that come by and maybe a a a minister of reputation or a minister that's got a tremendous gift. He comes in and he preaches a message and and and his personality, his nature, what he is. And I'm not saying he's saying anything wrong, but you're influenced by the man. And then you run that line for a while. And then somebody else comes in and he's majoring in in another point. And then you get under that influence and you run that line for a while. And we've had it for years in the message. &gt;&gt; This movement comes up, everybody goes in that line. And four years later, all the people that were in two souls, they all went into thunders. And the people that were in thunders, they all went into Perusia. &gt;&gt; And then they go into something else. They they're always influenced &gt;&gt; by by something else. So again, what influences you affects your influence. So make sure that those things are important and and that all goes along and it's just another way to today a different line of the same thought. Don't put faith in the accusations. They're trying to influence you away from every promise in the book, everything what it means to be a a real Christian. And and and you've got to be patient with me as a human being. I'm a human being. I I fight the devil. I don't I don't have every answer. I see something pop up on the scene, [snorts] I'm I'm slow to move. You know what I mean? I I I give something a lot of space and a lot of time. You know, and I I apologize to you when I when I got up and I I I spent a little too much time preaching on something that I didn't feel was right. If I have just let it go, it would have I I I just don't I What do you When it just peters out, you know what I mean? It just it fizzles away. It had its big boom. The rockets went out. The world was coming to an end. They had the revival. They're going to set the world on fire. You just sit back. Pretty soon, it's not being mentioned. It's not being followed. It's not being preached. All of us make mistakes. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let's us forgive as we forgive others. Let's believe in one another's motive and objective. If you don't believe in my motive and objective, there's no way I can help you. [snorts] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God said. She said, "If you can't get the people to believe you, if you get the people to believe you, nothing will stand in your way. Not even cancer. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Brother Van wasn't tooting his horn. &gt;&gt; He was trying to get the people to believe. &gt;&gt; If they could look at him and believe that was God speaking through him, they could have what they asked for. &gt;&gt; If people can look at you and see the life of God in you, they will accept your words and their lives will change. And you'll be changing lives, having influence on people, not running from circumstances and situations, &gt;&gt; but you'll go grow in Christ Jesus. I like what the man said. He said, "I'm not what I want to be, and I'm not what I ought to be. But I ain't what I used to be either. And I hope as I grow in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; that you can see that brother McGary's growing, &gt;&gt; that I'm ripening in the sun. &gt;&gt; And I want to be able to look at your lives and see your maturing and you're growing. Because the more he's with us and the more we grow in him, the more glory we can give him. &gt;&gt; And isn't there really that what we want to do? &gt;&gt; We just really want to praise the Lord. Thank you so much. It's uh 7 o'clock. That's two hours of preaching and I haven't even got to the other half of the book. You can't you can't preach one book in a lifetime. Do you know that? Because it's eternal word. It's going to take eternity to reveal him. Aren't you glad like that? One eternal revelation of God. Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to it. He's coming soon. God bless you, brother Billy. If you come be close this, thank you so much. You're so kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand. Amen. How many enjoy the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. That his influence may be in us that we may be able to influence others. Key of F. Amen. Oh, teach me, Lord. [singing] to wait [music] down [singing] on my knees.

Don't forget no service on Wednesday. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you appreciative for today? [music] You know, there's u a lot more effect of our influence when we don't realize how we're really influencing people. If that makes sense. If our normal [music] everyday life is at a level that people admire, want to be like it, like you said, be salty, and we're just doing what we're supposed to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it has a positive benefit. &gt;&gt; And if I could relate to you, just if I don't want to keep you, brother David can remember [music] probably 30 years ago, you came to my house with I think young baby. I'm not sure if it was Davey or Aaron. And I had been burned at work. And it was a hot water steam burn. [snorts] And it had come up on my face, one of my arms and my leg. Intense pain. And uh wound up in Parkland Hospital. And I thought they had a man about brother Ben's size. I thought he was the biggest black man in Dallas and he had the cheapest big razor and he was just shaving hair and skin and everything off of me. And uh I remember cuz Joy, we were expecting Joy at the time and they had to call Melinda at home and say, "Hey, you need to respond. Your husband's burned." And all of that aside, I got back to work and you talk about feeling about this tall. Everybody was ooing and aawing because I'd come back to work so fast with the prayers of the saints. [music] You think I'm ugly now. I got had a lot of new skin put on. It was it was amazing what the Lord had done for me. But you get back to work and the people say, "I can't believe what you how you experienced that, what you were going through." So I wound up on the front aisle with a water hose being sprayed on me and I was in my underwear. Unfortunately, there's no women at work there, but it was it was pretty bad. And but he said, or they all said, the only thing I was crying out was mercy, mercy, mercy. I'm appreciative that I was able in a time of pain and distress still as he said that pattern of good works the way I was raised my belief whatever it [music] was it had a positive influence on someone and [snorts] I think in our everyday life and can we just maintain that it's going to benefit us in the long run. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. [crying] Oh gracious Lord, we thank you Lord for the power of transformation. how your word Lord as our brother repeated a prophet said first we have to accept it in our mind Lord we're intellectual beings [music] so much of the time Lord we lean on that how we've been taught what we think what we believe but Lord when it's transferred down in the deep reaches of the heart and there's a firm belief that's unwavering Lord That's the part that's going to be carried out of this world, be transformed into another body. We won't take [clears throat] these old filthy minds with us. We've cleaned them up. We've set them aside for your service. But Lord, we're still linked to this mortal body. But there's a there's [snorts] a soul within us as we're 10,000 worlds, [music] Lord. That's the conversion. That's the salvation. That's the benefit, Lord. and we're going to take the character of God that's deep within us. So, we're thankful, Lord, we can express these things. And [music] Lord, I am thankful that you brought me through so many trials, but Lord, there is nothing. Lord, we go through it again just to say if I had a soul to win or somebody to help, Lord, be it unto me according to thy word. Lord, may we all go forth this week, Lord, this week of thanksgiving. If someone's down in the mouth or or Lord, without may we be able to help or aid or benefit by prayer or with money or whatever you have for us to give them, Lord, so we might be ambassadors of the cause of Christ. [music] Lord, not to benefit us, but to benefit you and your kingdom, Lord. There's a life that's lived, Lord, that we want to express that you are alive and well. So, Lord, though we be weak in body, though we just tend to fail with with everything we say and do, Lord, we still have a benefit of a righteous God within us. So Lord, may we all have a positive influence. Lord, may we receive the right influence. [music] Lord, we just appreciate you, your word this day. You think we we thank you for this time of rest, Lord, as we start a new work week. Maybe the kids are out of school. I don't know, Lord, but you just provide for our needs. Go with us. And Lord, may we look to you, Lord, to translate us one of these [music] clear mornings, Lord, into that immortal body that we're all desiring and searching for. Grant it to us now, Lord, as we love you. ask you to just go with us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and ask these things. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Happy Thanksgiving. Amen. I'll burn your turkey. Bite to you if you're [music] going to burn one. And uh we'll see you. Amen. God bless you. Peace. If you're walking [singing and music] through the valley, oh, and there's shadows all [music] around. Oh, do not fear. Oh, he will guide you. [music] He will keep you safe and sound [music] his will to never leave you. for you. [music] And his word is God is good [music] all the time. He put a song of praise in this [music] all the time. [music] The dark is light. [music] God is good. God [singing] is good [music] all the [music] unworthy. on the rise. [music] His [music] holy spirit we can save [music] that is [music] everlasting and his mercy. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God is good. [music] This [music] is good all the time. [music] His [singing] light will shine. [music] Hallelujah. You [music] want all the time? [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] You got heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; love. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
