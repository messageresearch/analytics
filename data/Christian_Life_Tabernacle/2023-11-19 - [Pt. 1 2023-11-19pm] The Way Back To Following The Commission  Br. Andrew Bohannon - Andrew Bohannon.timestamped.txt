[54:29] just Lifting Up Your Great Name
[54:32] believing that you oh God will finish

[54:36] building but in the house of the Living
[54:38] God your bride father we commit this
[54:40] little time of Fellowship praying that

[54:47] Christ's name
[54:49] amen praise the Lord how many are happy
[54:53] to be in the house of the Lord tonight
[54:55] amen well we certainly count it a grand
[54:58] privilege to be here and to share a
[55:01] heart with you we just trusting that the
[55:03] Lord will have his way uh I tell you I
[55:06] got a full heart but I don't know
[55:08] exactly how the Lord's going to unpack
[55:10] the service but you know we come with an
[55:12] expectation and God is faithful to his
[55:14] word amen how many are expecting God to
[55:17] speak to your need I don't know your
[55:20] need but God knows your need amen and by
[55:23] the promise of God word he's here to
[55:26] meet you personally individually I
[55:29] believe that I certainly appreciated how
[55:31] the Lord moved on our pastor and I'll
[55:33] just maybe start off with that scripture
[55:36] reading that he read um this morning and
[55:38] that's the faith that was once
[55:41] delivered there in Jude in verse three
[55:44] we'll just start there and trust the
[55:46] Lord will'll add a read a blessing to
[55:49] the reading of his word there in
[55:52] Jude verse three beloved when I gave all
[55:56] diligence to write unto you of the
[55:58] common
[55:59] salvation it was needful for me to write
[56:02] unto you to earnestly contend for the
[56:05] faith which was once delivered to the
[56:08] Saints amen you may have your
[56:12] seeds you know it was something that was
[56:15] on my heart we were praying for the
[56:18] special meetings and you know you go
[56:21] through different seasons in life you
[56:23] know sometimes you're needing a new job
[56:26] or sometimes you know there's a
[56:28] transition in your life and well you
[56:30] need God to come on the scene because
[56:32] it's not something vague you need
[56:34] something specific right you go through
[56:37] challenges and trials in life and our
[56:39] God wants to be there present as a
[56:42] living help amen not just uh you
[56:46] know like the the quote said I like that
[56:49] so much he's he's not just a halfhazard
[56:52] bystandard but he's there concerned
[56:54] about your needs he's concerned about
[56:56] your relationships he's concerned about
[56:58] your finances he's concerned about your
[57:01] health amen but he's provided something
[57:03] in the word of God to meet every need
[57:05] amen now the thing is is you know will
[57:09] we look inside and examine I I just so
[57:12] appreciated that you know that call to
[57:15] examine ourselves what was this Faith
[57:17] Delivered for what is it to produce what
[57:21] kind of results are these Faith to to to
[57:23] bring us as individuals right and it it
[57:26] got me you know the the uh you know the
[57:29] prayer service before our meetings I I
[57:31] just come to a desperation I said God
[57:34] and and it really shouldn't just be
[57:35] before special meetings it should be
[57:37] every time every day every moment of the
[57:39] day God don't let me make these
[57:41] decisions without your hand in my life I
[57:44] don't want to just you know take the big
[57:46] decisions and go to God oh I want to
[57:48] take all my choices cuz I've chosen to
[57:52] follow Christ amen amen there's there's
[57:55] nothing too significant for us to go to
[57:57] God and say God I need your leadership I
[58:00] need your
[58:02] direction there's nothing too small for
[58:05] God to say I'm mindful of that amen and
[58:09] I just took some little uh notes as as
[58:12] the Lord just placed something on my
[58:14] heart when we were having all these um
[58:17] you know expectations wanting to see how
[58:20] the Lord would deal with us as a body
[58:23] you know and special meetings are
[58:25] wonderful I I tell you in 2007 the Lord
[58:28] supernaturally touched my body just
[58:32] miraculously moved on my life changed me
[58:35] forever physically I can say from that
[58:38] time I was sitting about where leonte
[58:40] brother Leon sitting I was standing
[58:43] there and I was in pain and I was
[58:46] struggling but something there was a
[58:48] voice that say just stay a little longer
[58:50] you might be in your trial and God's
[58:52] just saying stay there a little bit
[58:54] longer
[58:55] just wait upon the Lord you'll renew
[58:57] your strength you'll Mount up as wings
[59:00] of eagles I was sitting there and I was
[59:02] saying I'm in so much pain I can't stand
[59:06] anymore but that voice said just stand a
[59:09] little longer how did I know what was
[59:11] around the corner of that commission
[59:13] that just stay at my word hold forth
[59:16] don't move don't sit down don't back
[59:20] up Hold Your Position I got something
[59:24] for you
[59:25] and I'm standing there and I'm in pain
[59:27] and I want to relent I want to Bow I
[59:30] want to Cave to the pressure I wouldn't
[59:33] just sit down and say ah I can't take it
[59:36] but oh my there's a rewarder who
[59:38] listened to the voice of God and take
[59:40] heed to the
[59:41] warning and I stood there and I was
[59:44] burning on fire my neck was hurting so
[59:47] bad I've never been in a service so long
[59:50] but oh my God blew my expectation out of
[59:54] the Waters I mean it was just glory and
[59:58] praise from my heart and tears of
[1:00:00] rejoicing because there was such a
[1:00:02] breeze of the spirit coming to fulfill
[1:00:05] his
[1:00:06] promise and all of the pain and all the
[1:00:08] dysfunction for years God delivered me
[1:00:12] he set me free healed me I praise God
[1:00:16] and His keeping power to keep that
[1:00:19] healing has never left salvation is good
[1:00:22] as long as you keep testifying keep
[1:00:25] giving God praise for saving me despite
[1:00:27] my condition despite the
[1:00:31] circumstances my God Lives not just does
[1:00:34] he live but he lives in me amen that's
[1:00:36] what he does he lives in you he's here
[1:00:39] to perform his good word to you praise
[1:00:43] God he's a personal God my God Lives
[1:00:49] that's the testimony when we go into all
[1:00:51] the world we have
[1:00:52] experience people want to know know that
[1:00:55] your God is real not just 20 years ago
[1:00:59] but he's here today what did he do for
[1:01:02] you
[1:01:03] today it might not be as what we would
[1:01:06] say big but oh God when he comes and
[1:01:09] speaks that still Small Voice
[1:01:13] Hallelujah
[1:01:15] Hallelujah now that's the kind of thing
[1:01:18] that pulsates in the Sons and Daughters
[1:01:20] of God my God still speaks amen
[1:01:26] well that's just enough to close the
[1:01:27] service
[1:01:29] but I thank the Lord for his
[1:01:31] faithfulness you know
[1:01:33] we we just you know we're a called out
[1:01:36] people and the called out uh the church
[1:01:40] means called out we were called out of
[1:01:43] Egypt called out of the world we were to
[1:01:46] be a separate people holy where the
[1:01:50] scripture says and I was going to read
[1:01:51] it and maybe we'll just go there and
[1:01:54] Peter
[1:01:55] just because we want to be identified
[1:01:57] with every scripture in First Peter I
[1:01:59] believe it
[1:02:02] is maybe by the help of the Lord I'll
[1:02:05] just maybe I can give a title to my
[1:02:08] thought but the way back to to following
[1:02:12] the commission and I just feel like
[1:02:14] that's the inspiration from what our P
[1:02:15] what was on our pastor's heart so the
[1:02:18] way back to following the
[1:02:21] commission so in 1 Peter chapter 2
[1:02:28] you know a lot of times Our Testimony is
[1:02:30] I'm well I'm just a sinner but what the
[1:02:33] blood did for us is it's changed us you
[1:02:37] you know the scripture says in First
[1:02:39] Corinthians you are new creatures in
[1:02:40] Christ Jesus behold all things are
[1:02:43] passed away behold all things are made
[1:02:45] new how many can testify that your
[1:02:47] life's not the same that it used to be
[1:02:50] because there's a God that come on the
[1:02:51] scene amen he spoke the words of life to
[1:02:54] you you had a heart to believe it and
[1:02:57] God fulfilled and manifest what he he's
[1:03:00] the only interpreter of his word amen
[1:03:03] the Liberty that we experience is
[1:03:05] because God has interpreted his word to
[1:03:07] us
[1:03:08] Amen in First Peter chapter
[1:03:12] 2 praise the
[1:03:17] Lord hopefully I don't get carried away
[1:03:19] with time I I know the last time I was I
[1:03:22] was thinking it was Wednesday and so
[1:03:24] like that clock is
[1:03:26] wrong oh
[1:03:30] my the scripture says there in First
[1:03:34] Peter chapter 2 and verse one it says
[1:03:37] wherefore
[1:03:38] lying laying aside all malice and all
[1:03:41] Gile and hypocrisies and envyings and
[1:03:43] all evil speaking as newborn babes
[1:03:47] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:03:50] we may grow
[1:03:52] hereby if so be that you have tasted
[1:03:55] that the Lord is gracious to whom coming
[1:03:59] as unto the Lively Stone the living
[1:04:02] Stone disallowed indeed of man but
[1:04:05] chosen of God and precious ye also as
[1:04:09] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:04:11] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:04:15] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:04:20] by Jesus Christ amen and so we just you
[1:04:24] know know we just had this thought about
[1:04:26] you know the way back to following the
[1:04:29] commission and I you know as I was
[1:04:32] pondering in that um prayer meeting you
[1:04:35] know it just sometimes in life you know
[1:04:37] we lose we lose our vision of why God
[1:04:43] came by our way and spoke to us you know
[1:04:46] how many here can say God spoke to me I
[1:04:49] mean that every single one of us should
[1:04:51] have a testimony God spoke to me amen
[1:04:54] really because that we're not even on
[1:04:55] first base as the carnal way of saying
[1:04:58] it you know we got to hear from God and
[1:05:02] how does God speak you know some people
[1:05:04] say well God spoke to me in the sunset
[1:05:06] and the the songs of the birds and you
[1:05:09] know I just seen the way people conduct
[1:05:12] themselves and oh God speaks to me
[1:05:14] there's a people that still honor God
[1:05:17] and I you know people can but God always
[1:05:19] speaks by his word it has to have a
[1:05:21] scriptural voice and so we got to stay
[1:05:24] with the word amen and so I got to
[1:05:27] thinking about you know when the Trials
[1:05:30] come and you're in a fiery fliction when
[1:05:33] you're in the furnace and when you turn
[1:05:35] this way there's Well's belly like Jonah
[1:05:39] you know you look this way and it's
[1:05:41] troubles it's insurmountable to human
[1:05:45] ability you look this way and I can't
[1:05:47] see a way past this everywhere you look
[1:05:51] is
[1:05:52] troubles but but once more will I look
[1:05:55] to the one who made the promise and we
[1:05:58] have to put our eyes back on what it was
[1:06:01] that God spoke to us in the
[1:06:03] beginning he told those disciples he
[1:06:06] said go into all the
[1:06:08] world what what I've done for you go
[1:06:10] tell somebody
[1:06:13] else so I just thought you know what is
[1:06:16] the purpose why God spoke to us you know
[1:06:20] each one of us you know because God is
[1:06:22] not just going to talk to us just to
[1:06:24] show that he can talk to us there's a
[1:06:27] reason there's a purpose in what he
[1:06:30] speaks to us amen and it's so personal
[1:06:34] every single one of us must receive the
[1:06:36] word of God as a personal
[1:06:40] commission it's my
[1:06:42] duty this is what I'm called to I'm
[1:06:45] called to fulfill this word of God Amen
[1:06:49] and as I was praying I was like you know
[1:06:52] I'm called out to serve his purpose
[1:06:54] purposes you know and something that as
[1:06:57] Brother David was going through the uh
[1:06:59] Church age I thought I'd read this
[1:07:02] because this is out of the Ephesians
[1:07:03] church and um not sure exactly what
[1:07:07] paragraph This is but it says this in
[1:07:09] the Ephesian Church age these Ephesians
[1:07:12] were Christians they bore a name and
[1:07:15] that name was Christ who was the spirit
[1:07:18] of God within them and which was one of
[1:07:21] the three-fold names of their
[1:07:25] lord and for my name's sake has labored
[1:07:29] and has not
[1:07:31] fainted these Believers were were not
[1:07:34] laboring for Paul or for an
[1:07:37] organization they weren't committing
[1:07:40] committed to programs and institutions
[1:07:42] whereby they build up Holdings of
[1:07:46] value they worked for the
[1:07:50] Lord when God speaks he's got something
[1:07:53] for you to do do and it's not for man
[1:07:56] it's for
[1:07:57] God we got to keep our eyes on the price
[1:08:00] we got to stay personal this is my duty
[1:08:04] to God he saved me I only owe him my
[1:08:08] everything why do we hold
[1:08:11] back are there secret things in our
[1:08:13] lives that we want to say well I can't
[1:08:16] give that to him because well he can't
[1:08:18] do nothing with it well I tell you if
[1:08:21] you will sell out everything else
[1:08:24] if you trust it into God's hands I don't
[1:08:27] care what it is if it's in his hands he
[1:08:30] could use
[1:08:31] it now don't tell them how to use
[1:08:36] it I told the Lord after I got the men
[1:08:40] in gidas I said Lord I'll serve you all
[1:08:42] the rest of my days no more
[1:08:45] arguing that's the
[1:08:47] challenge that's the challenge God you
[1:08:49] can use me to do this and to do that but
[1:08:52] don't don't use me to do that
[1:08:55] my Lord help us amen help
[1:08:59] me they didn't go to church on Sunday
[1:09:02] and talk about the name and then forget
[1:09:04] about it the rest of the week they
[1:09:06] didn't give lip service to his name no
[1:09:09] sir they was it was their lives they
[1:09:14] were given and all they did they did in
[1:09:17] that name you know if you can't do
[1:09:20] something in jesus' name leave it
[1:09:22] alone right
[1:09:24] if you got a question about
[1:09:26] it don't play
[1:09:28] games we want our faith to be pure we
[1:09:32] want to be able to walk forward and know
[1:09:34] I I have no condemnation in my
[1:09:39] heart
[1:09:50] amen all they did they did in his name
[1:09:53] and that name in the name they acted but
[1:09:57] if they could not act in that name they
[1:10:00] refrain from
[1:10:01] acting these were Heavenly places these
[1:10:05] were Heavenly placed Christians who
[1:10:07] Behavior was in the Lord but the false
[1:10:10] Vine the group that wanted to defile the
[1:10:13] name and hung the skulling wolves in the
[1:10:16] dark waiting to get in and tear down but
[1:10:19] the Saints stood the test and kept the
[1:10:22] word and the name
[1:10:25] how many know you come here to be tested
[1:10:28] lift your hand if you know you've come
[1:10:29] here to be
[1:10:31] tested amen I've come here to be
[1:10:34] tested the test is the greatest thing
[1:10:37] for you with no test no
[1:10:40] overcoming if you're facing a test it's
[1:10:43] because God has confidence that if
[1:10:45] you'll commit it to him and let him lead
[1:10:48] you he'll give you the victory because
[1:10:50] he's already conquered it he's conquered
[1:10:52] the worst H death hell and the
[1:10:55] grave he made us to where we were
[1:10:58] impotent we couldn't we couldn't produce
[1:11:01] the Son of God or the daughter of God we
[1:11:04] always wanted to do I don't want to do
[1:11:05] that I don't want to be like that I
[1:11:07] don't want to talk like that I don't
[1:11:09] want to act like that but praise God
[1:11:12] when we come in contact with a life that
[1:11:15] had some kind of living
[1:11:19] character oh my we had a dying character
[1:11:22] we just lived for ourselves but like we
[1:11:25] heard when we go to that day on Calvary
[1:11:28] and we have we understand what that day
[1:11:31] on Calvary meant for me changes
[1:11:34] everything because we no longer are
[1:11:37] bound to our sin nature our selfish
[1:11:39] nature I me my and everything else is
[1:11:42] mine
[1:11:43] too sometimes we get these
[1:11:46] attitudes like this is my church this is
[1:11:48] my Pew and you know they don't control
[1:11:52] the things like I would do them oh my
[1:11:54] goodness gracious Lord help
[1:12:03] me the complaint of God Revelations 2:4
[1:12:07] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:12:09] thee that because thou has left thy
[1:12:11] first
[1:12:12] love to understand this you must realize
[1:12:15] that the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:12:18] original Saints of Ephesus alone these
[1:12:20] are this message is to the entire age
[1:12:23] which would last about 120
[1:12:27] years its message then is to all the
[1:12:30] generations in that span you know one of
[1:12:34] the things that brother brandom taught
[1:12:35] and I I'm paraphrasing so I'm just kind
[1:12:37] of going out there but you know when you
[1:12:39] go through and you look at all of the
[1:12:41] church ages there's a rebuke and a
[1:12:43] complaint but then there's an
[1:12:45] admonition you know and from the day of
[1:12:47] Ephesus from the start of where Paul was
[1:12:50] preaching and he was seeing all this was
[1:12:52] coming in and it was who is going to get
[1:12:54] like quick quick go down into the ground
[1:12:56] but we at the end time all of the reward
[1:13:00] to the Overcomer we have access
[1:13:03] to Ephesians they just had access to the
[1:13:07] the reward of the first age Overcomer
[1:13:10] the second age Overcomer the third age
[1:13:12] Overcomer but oh my we're such a
[1:13:15] privileged people that we can take and
[1:13:17] have the full
[1:13:20] reward if we'll just steal away and get
[1:13:22] along with God and let him speak to us
[1:13:26] again oh
[1:13:28] my oh my think that God wants to have
[1:13:31] this kind of fellowship with us you know
[1:13:35] that's part of his purpose in speaking
[1:13:37] to us he's like I got so much for you
[1:13:41] but sometimes we're so filled up with
[1:13:43] other things it's hard to empty out and
[1:13:46] let go that's what we were do we were
[1:13:48] made to empty out and a lot of times we
[1:13:52] get tricked into holding on to stuff you
[1:13:55] know
[1:13:57] entertainments you know movies video
[1:14:00] games you know you name it success in
[1:14:03] business money chasing after careers or
[1:14:06] whatever we get all filled up we're all
[1:14:08] guilty of it but God says if you would
[1:14:10] just surrender and give your future to
[1:14:13] me I'll make it exactly what I promised
[1:14:17] it'll be I and you and you and me oh
[1:14:20] what a Divine Fellowship I don't want to
[1:14:22] lose the I don't want to lose the
[1:14:24] purpose which God has called me to why
[1:14:26] he spoke to me in the first
[1:14:29] place oh my I've been called out from
[1:14:31] Egypt not to look like the world but to
[1:14:34] look like a Son of God under the
[1:14:36] tutorship of the Holy
[1:14:37] Ghost the tutorship of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] led me to this message Led you to this
[1:14:43] message he wants you to be a fruit
[1:14:45] bearing tree a brid tree that's rose up
[1:14:48] and has end time fruit cuz there's been
[1:14:51] an end time seed sign
[1:14:54] it's been Jesus Christ coming to speak
[1:14:57] to you and say you come from the mind of
[1:14:59] God I have things for you I have I know
[1:15:04] my thoughts towards
[1:15:06] you thoughts of Peace not of
[1:15:10] evil to bring you to an expected
[1:15:13] end you know it's just when you when you
[1:15:17] seek the Lord with all of your
[1:15:20] heart you know sometimes we give half
[1:15:23] hearted offerings to God
[1:15:27] halfhearted you know our sacrifice can
[1:15:30] only go so far today
[1:15:33] tired I don't feel like
[1:15:36] it but oh God let the Insight man have
[1:15:39] preeminence cuz there's no weakness in
[1:15:42] there but it's when we blend the carnal
[1:15:45] mind and try to be in that lukewarm God
[1:15:48] I'll just give you part of me but he
[1:15:50] deserves all of us amen amen amen
[1:15:56] amen oh my where am I
[1:16:04] at you know it's that's where true
[1:16:06] worship happens when we can surrender
[1:16:09] all when God spoke to me in March 2nd
[1:16:14] 2002
[1:16:15] I you know I was just in the world
[1:16:19] really just a nominal believer and never
[1:16:21] heard the message but you know I I
[1:16:24] really believe that there was more in
[1:16:26] life than just living a half-hearted
[1:16:29] life you know still in the world
[1:16:33] believing that there was more I just
[1:16:35] couldn't I couldn't attend to it I
[1:16:37] didn't have that something that could
[1:16:39] overcome I never come in contact with
[1:16:41] the message of the hour at that time but
[1:16:43] I had a longing all I had was a
[1:16:45] longing I was
[1:16:47] hungry you know and we know that hungry
[1:16:50] children will eat out the garbage can so
[1:16:53] I'm trying to take in this preacher and
[1:16:55] that preacher and this preacher and that
[1:16:57] preacher listening to Radio preaching
[1:16:59] trying
[1:17:00] to fill up but never victory over the
[1:17:05] sin in my life and one day by The
[1:17:08] Sovereign choosing of God God spoke to
[1:17:11] me I was talking to my mom on the phone
[1:17:14] I've shared this testimony before but
[1:17:16] she told me I was at work and she called
[1:17:18] at lunch she said you know I just want
[1:17:19] to let you know when you get off of work
[1:17:21] I know you're working but why don't you
[1:17:23] stop by the hospital we had to take your
[1:17:25] grandmother to the hospital she was
[1:17:27] having shortness of breath and I was
[1:17:29] under the intoxication of my lunch break
[1:17:32] and just being worldly and you know
[1:17:35] gifts and callings are without
[1:17:37] repentance you either have a gift to
[1:17:39] hear from God or you don't you either
[1:17:42] been uh predestinated to a new birth or
[1:17:47] you're
[1:17:48] not and so here I am in that filth and
[1:17:52] that condition
[1:17:54] you know I've never met God really in my
[1:17:56] great high mountains it was always in my
[1:17:59] sickness and it where I was destitute
[1:18:02] and needed a savior and I knew it I'm
[1:18:06] like I can't fix myself but I was
[1:18:09] believing there was a possibility why I
[1:18:12] don't
[1:18:15] know but I was on the phone and she told
[1:18:18] me she's like you
[1:18:20] know if you'll stop by I think it'll
[1:18:23] it'll um it'll be good for your
[1:18:25] grandmother and so I said okay and uh I
[1:18:29] I was like I'll do that probably a
[1:18:30] couple hours from now and so I hung up
[1:18:33] the phone and it was like a voice spoke
[1:18:36] and said she's not going to come out of
[1:18:38] the hospital alive and you know it's
[1:18:40] just a sobering thing to me because
[1:18:43] whenever the Lord speaks it's with a
[1:18:46] purpose and it usually is to warn us of
[1:18:50] something that's coming and if we'll
[1:18:53] take heed to it it'll bring life we
[1:18:57] might not understand it and it might be
[1:18:59] a difficult it might be painful but
[1:19:03] don't let the pain keep us from staying
[1:19:06] focused that's the
