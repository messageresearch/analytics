[5:44] realize that it is by grace and by faith

[5:57] called us Lord God
[6:00] Lord God we have no right or no
[6:02] responsibility to be in this sacred
[6:04] Place Lord God because we have lived the

[7:17] itself upon the chest and said Lord God

[25:12] great Lord
[25:15] It's just Thrills our soul that you want
[25:18] to share your greatness with us Lord you
[25:21] want us to partake of it and share it
[25:26] and father spread it abroad
[25:29] the scripture says the love of God
[25:31] spread
[25:32] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit
[25:37] father we ask that you'd bless us and
[25:39] lift us up in jesus' name we pray amen
[25:43] amen let's just read one scripture
[25:46] that's real uh we all know it by heart
[25:50] uh found in Hebrews and and because
[25:53] we're talking of faith we want to say
[25:56] but Faith but without faith it is
[25:59] impossible to please
[26:02] him for he that cometh to God must
[26:07] believe that he
[26:09] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[26:14] that diligently seek him and then he
[26:17] goes and explains by by this Faith all
[26:20] the things the men did father bless your
[26:22] word to us you may be seated this
[26:24] evening
[26:26] and so we just want just continue on
[26:31] just a a a little bit more about faith
[26:35] and we'll be probably uh uh speaking
[26:41] about it quite a bit and we're going to
[26:43] play a little portion of tape tonight
[26:46] this is almost small enough crowd to go
[26:49] get ice cream at uh at Andes I I was
[26:55] going to do that the other night when it
[26:57] was 10 degrees
[26:58] you all get a rain check for a warm
[27:01] night amen that it' be a blessed time
[27:04] for those of you that have come out and
[27:07] for all the you those that are listening
[27:09] at home uh you probably make sure you
[27:13] don't have one eye on the football game
[27:15] and one eye on the uh service you know
[27:19] be sold out one way or the other you
[27:22] can't serve two masters you know what I
[27:25] mean but uh uh we just trust that
[27:28] there's something real important uh
[27:30] tonight and I know some people have
[27:32] things that they need to be done but we
[27:34] want to talk a a little bit uh we're
[27:37] talking about faith and and the the
[27:42] perfect faith and and what it does for
[27:46] the believer and and so the first thing
[27:50] that we realize is that and just just
[27:54] think about this for a moment he says
[27:56] the truth of all
[27:58] life the truth of all life is God
[28:03] redeeming his children Back to Eden
[28:07] through Jesus Christ his son our kinsman
[28:11] redeemer that's the truth of all life
[28:15] all every every thing that's going on
[28:19] the truth of all life is is the father
[28:23] restoring us back to to the kingdom and
[28:27] it and there's no other truth outside of
[28:30] that and so no and that's what he said
[28:33] Heaven and Earth will pass away but my
[28:36] word will not pass away and so if if you
[28:41] understand that's the truth that's what
[28:43] set you free and that's what Jesus said
[28:46] I am the way the truth the life no man
[28:49] comes to the father but by me and and in
[28:54] another place he speaks what would a man
[28:56] give in exchange for his soul and what
[29:00] is it profiteth a man if he gains the
[29:03] whole world and loses his soul so the
[29:08] the reality of what what our faith does
[29:12] and and and I I like that statement that
[29:16] uh we read that the the uh faith is I
[29:21] got to I was going to try to read it
[29:23] with one eye but I got to have four eyes
[29:26] it says it he says and a Believer is the
[29:31] faith of God that moves in you without
[29:35] faith it it's impossible to please God
[29:39] and what and and and that God is a
[29:42] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[29:45] him so if I could say it like that a
[29:48] Believer is the faith the reward of God
[29:52] moving through you the reward of eternal
[29:56] life the reward W of Deliverance the
[29:59] Lord of blessings all those things in
[30:02] your life moving through your life Faith
[30:05] isn't a a a a list of dogmas and
[30:10] doctrines and and beliefs that's not
[30:13] faith faith is
[30:15] actually such a fundamental source of
[30:18] your life it moves and so there's a
[30:21] perfect faith and and I I I want to just
[30:24] and we want the faith because we're
[30:27] we're holding on uh we're holding on for
[30:32] uh a a Rapture that's what we're living
[30:34] for that's what we're believing for so
[30:37] we I want to talk
[30:39] about uh let me see if
[30:46] uh my perfect Faith here where are you
[30:49] all right so we I want to talk to this
[30:52] little thought and then we're going to
[30:54] play a little portion of tape uh to back
[30:59] it up so this morning we talked about
[31:01] the power is in you and we read
[31:05] scriptures so in other words when God
[31:07] created us he created us with the
[31:11] ability and the uh the capability and
[31:15] and and the uh ability to change the
[31:20] effect of things around us to change the
[31:25] course of events to to make changes in
[31:29] people's lives to influence the outcome
[31:33] and have a change the the the power to
[31:37] do that by faith and and that's what the
[31:40] Lord Jesus did when he came when he came
[31:43] up upon that the man that was uh bound
[31:47] with chains and and and full of demons
[31:51] he came up and he had the power to make
[31:55] a change in that man's life to have an
[31:59] effect on that man's life by by the word
[32:03] of God and and he he took those demons
[32:07] and he cast those demons out of that
[32:10] man's life and the power to was the
[32:15] ability and the capability of of having
[32:19] that done uh and I know we get in such a
[32:23] battle sometimes about well is it us
[32:26] doing it or is it God doing it and and
[32:31] we we do all things through Christ Jesus
[32:36] who strengthens us the worlds were
[32:39] created by Him but in his creation and
[32:43] in his mind he saw you with this power
[32:50] that he put in you
[32:53] working you you understand so it's not
[32:56] an idea of who's getting credit for it
[32:59] that's what's messed everything up every
[33:01] anyway is man always trying to get
[33:04] credit for him it was my preaching and
[33:07] and I done this and and this is the
[33:11] great works of my hand and and look at
[33:15] all that I've done for the kingdom and
[33:18] and and it just is is just all so wrong
[33:22] because God had it all pre-planned from
[33:24] the beginning he knew the beginning from
[33:27] the end he knew he was going to give you
[33:30] the faith he knew that he was going to
[33:32] place the power in you and he knew that
[33:35] as you begin to hear the word of God
[33:39] that word of God would bring that Faith
[33:43] to life in you without the word faith
[33:47] comes from the word and the word
[33:50] alone if I could say it this way faith
[33:54] is the
[33:55] word faith is is what the word generates
[34:01] what's another word for Faith Revelation
[34:05] so when you see a
[34:07] promise and the promise is revealed to
[34:10] you the outcome of that promise is
[34:13] revealed to you then then and you you
[34:16] act on that promise then it the faith
[34:20] came from the word it was revealed to
[34:24] you now you act upon it you have the
[34:28] power in you to see that Revelation
[34:31] through all the way to its
[34:35] End Amen now let's we want to talk about
[34:39] Peter and we're just going to read this
[34:41] little bit and then listen to our tape
[34:44] and then we're going to have a
[34:47] baptism amen so I I just think that's
[34:51] that's wonderful
[34:54] uh uh uh sister a and uh Zan is going to
[34:59] get uh baptized so I think that's
[35:02] wonderful anyen we're looking at sis if
[35:05] I messed your name up you know I told
[35:07] you I could do stuff like that so but
[35:10] anyway it's just wonderful now we want
[35:12] to talk about
[35:14] Peter Peter heard the word of the
[35:17] Lord come walk on the
[35:21] water right who is it it's it's it's the
[35:25] Lord come and he says Lord if it be you
[35:28] bid me
[35:31] come right if it be you bid me come well
[35:37] it was him so he could only do one
[35:41] thing right is B him
[35:44] come isn't that what we did Lord if this
[35:47] is you bid us come if this is the truth
[35:52] bring me to you Lord so we've all asked
[35:55] the Lord and He bids us come
[35:58] so Peter he he started out he got out of
[36:02] the boat he said the L Lord told me to
[36:05] come he said but uh he said if but the
[36:10] Lord told me to do it he bid me come so
[36:13] he started walking and this I want to
[36:15] pick it up from here because we're
[36:17] trying to go a little place he said and
[36:21] he stepped down and said it's the
[36:25] Lord I'll just walk
[36:28] and when he got his eyes on the wave he
[36:31] got
[36:33] scared what come in his
[36:37] mind where's the
[36:39] battle in the mind so every time the
[36:43] word shows
[36:45] up the enemy shows
[36:48] up there's that's where the battle is
[36:51] the flesh Wars against the spirit a
[36:54] spirit against the Flesh and so
[36:58] he said what come in his mind first
[37:01] thing I'm going to walk because the word
[37:05] said for me to
[37:11] walk that was the first
[37:14] thing he says and the next thing he
[37:18] looked at his well he looked at his
[37:21] symptoms he looked out there and seen
[37:24] how big them waves was and he got got
[37:28] scared he looked at what is he doing I'm
[37:31] walking on water I'm not supposed to
[37:34] walk on water I'm not worthy to walk on
[37:37] water I'm not supposed to be able to
[37:40] walk on water nobody walks on
[37:45] water right you know what I mean the
[37:48] minut he started reasing it reason he
[37:50] tried to put some reality to it as as
[37:55] soon as he tried to put some common
[37:57] sense to
[37:59] it well what's the big thing now what
[38:03] what's the whole thing we're now are
[38:05] going to be a country of what common
[38:10] sense no we're not I ain't going to have
[38:13] no common
[38:17] sense common sense is for thing that
[38:20] people that expect common things I'm
[38:24] going to have
[38:25] Supernatural sense yes sir I'm going a
[38:29] believe for things that go Beyond
[38:33] Reason yes sir things that can't be
[38:37] figured out things that make no
[38:41] sense right so let just so see he said
[38:46] he began to look at all his
[38:48] circumstances all his situation all
[38:50] really what he was
[38:53] doing and you know but the Lord told
[38:56] them come that was what what his first
[38:58] thought he says and what and what he he
[39:01] said the waves and he got scared and
[39:05] when he did down he went see what he
[39:09] feared happened what he
[39:13] believed
[39:16] happened so if fear can produce a
[39:22] result Faith Can Pro produce a result
[39:28] just because fear challenges you and the
[39:30] circumstance challenges you and the
[39:33] situation challenges you and the doctors
[39:36] and the society and the government and
[39:40] everything challenges you that doesn't
[39:42] matter it's not the it's not the
[39:45] challenge you don't even you can't give
[39:47] any weight to the challenge you're get
[39:50] you've got to believe one thing or the
[39:52] other and Faith believes what God Said
[39:55] Peter's faith believ beli D that God
[39:59] told him to walk and so what he believed
[40:03] happened and then what he
[40:06] feared
[40:07] happened listen so he what he
[40:10] believed
[40:12] happened and and and what he feared
[40:16] happened what he believed happened he
[40:19] went when he believed he could
[40:23] walk he walked and when he believe and
[40:27] when and he believed he got scared in
[40:31] his
[40:33] belief now think of that just a moment
[40:36] he got scared about what he was
[40:42] believing and I I that just struck me so
[40:46] much because you know you believe for
[40:49] something Supernatural maybe a de
[40:52] healing or maybe somehow
[40:55] miraculously having a bless blessing
[40:57] come in your life and all of a sudden
[40:59] you get scared oh I'm believing for too
[41:02] much I'm believing for too big what what
[41:04] if it do doesn't happen uh maybe I
[41:08] shouldn't believe so big prophet of God
[41:10] said believe big ask
[41:15] big you know mean is anything too hard
[41:18] for God we have not because we asked not
[41:22] and we asked not but you understand he
[41:25] actually got scared in what he
[41:32] believed I wonder if that hadn't that
[41:34] hadn't happened to a lot of people in
[41:36] the message oh I'm believing God sent a
[41:38] prophet and there's supposed to be false
[41:41] prophets and I believe that's a pillar
[41:43] of fire and what happens if it's not the
[41:45] uh the pillar of fire and they actually
[41:48] get afraid of what they believe he got
[41:50] scared in what he
[41:54] believed oh I wish that I had words
[41:57] to express how that struck
[42:02] me maybe I shouldn't be believing for
[42:06] this maybe I shouldn't be believing that
[42:10] I get well maybe I shouldn't be
[42:12] believing that I I would like to have a
[42:15] family maybe I shouldn't be believing in
[42:17] this maybe I should all the odds all all
[42:20] the maybe I and they actually think get
[42:23] Fray afraid of what they're believing
[42:28] so we'll find something simpler to
[42:32] believe no believe big all things are
[42:37] possible he got scared in his belief
[42:40] then his substance left him see he still
[42:44] Pro professed his faith but he didn't
[42:47] have the substance the substance would
[42:50] have went right on over the top of that
[42:53] white cap and went right to him see if
[42:57] he had that perfect Faith see but but he
[43:01] didn't have it he thought he did he did
[43:05] it
[43:06] first and he was willing to venture
[43:10] right out why the Lord told me to do it
[43:14] it's got to happen so he just so he just
[43:19] stepped right out of the boat and to to
[43:23] and takes off he never thought of about
[43:28] the waves how contrary they was he never
[43:33] got that in his
[43:36] mind see his first reaction his first
[43:39] God said so he did it but then reasoning
[43:43] comes in then he thinks what did I ask
[43:47] that for oh I didn't consider about the
[43:50] waves wait a minute no man walks on
[43:54] water well no virgin can see D either
[43:58] but one
[44:01] did he never got that in his mind now
[44:05] when he you get to
[44:08] thinking well now wait and you know I've
[44:11] been sick a long time stop you just
[44:14] might as well go back to the boat see
[44:19] but when you quit thinking about that
[44:23] Abraham considered not his own body now
[44:27] now dead neither the deadness of Sarah's
[44:30] womb he didn't think about
[44:35] that didn't even consider it it wasn't
[44:39] even brought into the understand his
[44:44] understanding he didn't even consider
[44:47] that at all he just considered what God
[44:50] Said and he went on and as long as Peter
[44:54] did that he walked
[44:58] you understand where Faith's coming from
[45:00] now solely he said but Jesus lived in a
[45:05] world that no one know about he was a
[45:08] odd person he lived in a world of
[45:10] perfect faith in the perfect God in
[45:13] which he was and if we lived in a
[45:17] perfect faith of a
[45:19] Christian to what we are we'd be a
[45:23] Mystic to the world people would
[45:27] wouldn't understand
[45:29] you you'd walk in the spirit what the
[45:33] spirit said you'd do what he forbid you
[45:37] you would not do then the people begin
[45:40] to say you'd be a Mystic person to them
[45:45] that's the way it is to all believers
[45:49] they're a Mystic they people don't
[45:53] understand because they live in a world
[45:56] to thems eles Jesus lived in a world
[45:59] that nobody else could touch the
[46:01] disciples couldn't understand him when
[46:04] he spoke to them they said they'd say
[46:07] this and then they'd say why why you
[46:12] talk in riddles we don't understand this
[46:16] how can how can this be see they they
[46:21] wasn't in the world that he was living
[46:24] in see they couldn't
[46:27] understand it nobody could understand
[46:29] him now this is what the Holy Spirit
[46:33] does it brings us into the world that he
[46:37] was living in that's right I will I will
[46:42] not I will not leave you comfortless but
[46:45] I personal pronoun will come again and I
[46:49] will be with you and I will be in you
[46:54] and now once you make that contact and
[46:58] that's what the prophet of God said you
[46:59] can believe something but every believer
[47:03] must have that personal contact and then
[47:07] once you have that personal contact and
[47:11] then you're in the world that he walked
[47:14] in otherwise you're on the outside
[47:18] believing it but you can never make it
[47:21] come to pass but when you have the Co
[47:24] contact of it that world becomes a
[47:27] reality to you now you can say I can
[47:30] walk in the world of divine action I can
[47:34] walk in the world where
[47:37] Supernatural things take place this can
[47:41] happen for
[47:42] me wait that's mystic the thinking that
[47:46] doesn't fit any of the latest scientific
[47:50] magazines it doesn't fit social culture
[47:53] it doesn't fit mathematics and education
[47:56] I don't care that's the world you live
[47:59] in I live in a world that God said so
[48:03] that settles
[48:07] it now to wrap this part of it
[48:14] up and so when a man lives by faith and
[48:19] walks by faith I mean the substance of
[48:23] Faith he is isolated from the entire
[48:27] world and from the entire world and
[48:32] becomes a new creature in
[48:35] Christ he's thinking
[48:37] different let this mind be in you that
[48:40] was in Christ he's joying errors every
[48:44] promise in the book is his it's not a
[48:48] mixture you understand it's not okay we
[48:51] know there's a God James said Satan
[48:54] believes in
[48:55] God and fears and
[48:58] trembles it's not believing that God is
[49:01] it's believing that everything that God
[49:04] is you are every promise is in the book
[49:08] of you everything that God has done or
[49:11] will do he can do for
[49:14] you everything you can look in the
[49:17] scripture every Bible story can become
[49:20] your
[49:22] story every
[49:24] character can live out
[49:27] that story in your
[49:30] life he said that that when when you get
[49:33] to that place he said there then there
[49:38] now you're getting you're getting into
[49:42] bride
[49:44] material you're getting into rapturing
[49:48] condition
[49:49] now that means for each one of us not
[49:54] just the pastor now de trustee that
[49:58] means for every
[50:00] ly every individual walks in a world
[50:05] with God Alone you're baptized into his
[50:08] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[50:11] you and God see he gives you orders and
[50:16] you pack them out whatever he says
[50:19] there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere in
[50:23] you walk right on if the Lord says this
[50:28] there's nobody in the world can talk you
[50:30] out of it you go right ahead on just the
[50:34] same and you you you're coming into
[50:38] perfect Faith
[50:40] perfect Perfection that cannot fail that
[50:45] faith never fails he was a
[50:49] Mystic to he was a Mystic to them with
[50:53] his perfect faith and so it is now now
[50:57] with those who have perfect Faith they
[51:00] Mystics to
[51:02] others amen no and and don't take this
[51:06] out that you say well I I I'm a Mystic
[51:09] to the world you know I walk in a world
[51:12] of our our own that's true but then you
[51:16] begin to understand that God Made You
[51:18] members in particular and then took all
[51:22] that he was and put it into action
[51:25] through other peoples through you what
[51:29] did when the disciples were endued with
[51:30] power from on high every one of them
[51:33] became
[51:35] Mystics right Peter has a vision he sees
[51:38] things comes down the spirit of God
[51:40] tells them to run over to
[51:42] cornelius's house or Simon the Tanner
[51:45] he's down there and he he comes out and
[51:47] he gets there and they said eat and he
[51:49] said oh don't touch that was clean and
[51:52] he he says then the holy spirit says
[51:54] that you can be baptized too
[51:58] it's all still for other
[52:01] people because the whole
[52:03] commission was to go into the world and
[52:07] preach the gospel the whole commission
[52:10] was go out and find my sheep what did he
[52:14] tell Peter feed my sheep feed my
[52:19] Lambs so it was all about putting and
[52:22] uniting this bride together so we see
[52:27] that this great faith and so Faith sees
[52:30] what God wants you to see Faith sees
[52:34] what God
[52:36] sees and and so you know we talk about
[52:39] speak the
[52:41] word now we're going to play this little
[52:43] portion of tape and and and I want to
[52:46] say this because this is from Ry cry
[52:48] speak you hear a lot of people and and
[52:52] it's been going on in this message for a
[52:54] long time speak the word
[52:57] speak the word and and remember speak
[53:00] the word is not some madeup word or some
[53:05] uh desire or
[53:09] wish it speak the word means
[53:13] speak the word not a word not a new word
[53:19] that's right you know it it it doesn't
[53:20] mean that oh I need a ride over to some
[53:24] place speak the word
[53:27] word speak a car into existence or or do
[53:32] this
[53:34] no you speak the word you stand back and
[53:36] say God I need this to done would you
[53:40] you can provide me away and now I'm
[53:43] going to wait for the
[53:45] manifestation of what that you promis
[53:49] the word you speak is the promised word
[53:53] you speak what God had said
[53:57] you speak the promise you speak what God
[54:01] sees you speak his word coming to pass
[54:05] faith is the
[54:08] word so this morning we talked about
[54:12] power and we talked about where it comes
[54:17] from and your position so I want to play
[54:21] out of this
[54:23] message why Christ speak
[54:26] and because I want you to know that God
[54:30] is wanting you to take the word and put
[54:35] it in action you're called for it and so
[54:41] out of why Christ speak he speaks this
[54:44] little lesson here and he starts this
[54:47] out if you have uh I I guess it might be
[54:51] a a a phone that you follow on or tablet
[54:56] or or what whatever it is the prophet of
[54:59] God makes this thing
[55:03] here he says and here they come to the
[55:06] place a little trial come up and Moses
[55:10] begins to cry what shall I do what did
[55:14] they do they ran into the Red Sea
[55:16] there's the Egyptians and Moses all of a
[55:20] sudden is lost for
[55:23] words he don't know what to do
[55:27] but he already knew what to do he was
[55:30] already told what to do and now the
[55:33] prophet of God wants to catch this
[55:36] lesson and the and and this is what the
[55:39] disciples lacked we heard this morning
[55:42] imp perfect Faith they they fail to know
[55:47] their position and their calling so just
[55:52] listen to this little portion if you
[55:54] would it's it's it's just
[55:57] 50 paragraphs maybe 15 minutes or or so
[56:02] and uh it it I hope it I trust that it
[56:06] will be a uh a a blessing to you and God
[56:11] bless you I want you to notice this is a
[56:15] great lesson here now I love this see
[56:17] see Moses if we read here right that Mo
[56:19] when the children begin to get scared to
[56:21] seeing Pharaoh coming after in the line
[56:22] of duty God had performed everything
[56:24] perfectly now he started on the journey
[56:27] he's got the church together they've
[56:28] been called out they come from every
[56:30] denomination they all got together Moses
[56:33] went back there and said Lord what must
[56:34] I do he say well go do this all right go
[56:37] ahead now Moses you know I've called you
[56:39] to do this yes Lord all right you go

[56:45] it come everything was thus sayith the
[56:47] Lord thus sayith the Lord thus sayith
[56:48] the Lord now it gets into trouble and
[56:50] God said now I've got them started on
[56:51] their Journey they're all done called
[56:53] out the church is together so I've got
[56:55] them on the journey now Moses take him
[56:56] on over I told you dude I'm going to sit
[56:58] down and rest a while Moses said oh Lord
[57:01] look coming here Here Comes Pharaoh the
[57:03] people are all what must have do what
[57:04] must have
[57:06] do see there isn't that just human being
[57:09] yes sir begin to cry what must I do here
[57:13] we see Moses expressing the fully human
[57:18] nature always wants God to get behind
[57:21] you and push you into something now
[57:23] that's us today you want God after seen
[57:26] all we've seen yet you want God to push
[57:28] you to do something see Moses had just
[57:30] laxed around said God will go ask you

[57:36] ordained him for the job proved that he
[57:39] was with him and here he is the
[57:41] circumstance comes up and then he begins
[57:42] to cry What Can I Do Lord what can I do
[57:46] now you remember he had already
[57:47] prophesied here before he said these
[57:50] Egyptians at you see today you'll see no

[57:54] out God what can we do
[57:57] he' done done a pretty good job in
[57:59] prophesying there see done told him what
[58:00] would happen if the word of God was in
[58:02] him it was in him and when he was
[58:04] telling that it actually come to pass
[58:06] what he said was already going to come
[58:08] to pass and here was crying out what am

[59:01] wonders that draw them all together in
[59:02] one group amen you follow me amen

[1:02:09] Moses and the people that it was him by
[1:02:12] the word and by the things that was said
[1:02:14] come to pass it was clearly identified
[1:02:16] there was no need of him worrying
[1:02:18] anymore about it see there's no more of
[1:02:20] him thinking anything about because it's
[1:02:21] already cleared up he already done these
[1:02:23] things he had already proved by uh
[1:02:26] flies and fleas that he spoke things
[1:02:28] into
[1:02:30] creation that the word of God was in him

[1:02:59] and it went right down before the people
[1:03:01] and performed these Miracles and
[1:03:02] everything he said had come to pass even
[1:03:04] bringing things into creation doing the
[1:03:06] things that only God could do showing
[1:03:09] that his voice was God's voice and here
[1:03:11] was a circumstance with that people that

[1:09:44] it you you and I I I this is kind
[1:09:48] of what I just thought he brought out so
[1:09:52] so beautifully
[1:09:55] he he says like this he says man wants
[1:09:59] to rest and let God do the
[1:10:02] pushing we're always waiting for God to
[1:10:06] push us into it why we want to make sure
[1:10:09] it's his
[1:10:11] will he came up of a circumstance now
[1:10:14] Moses is saying is it your will I go
[1:10:16] over to this water is it your will I go
[1:10:18] over to the promised
[1:10:20] land every everything that God had done
[1:10:24] all of a sudden brings him in to
[1:10:29] questioning
[1:10:31] everything God saved me off that rooftop
[1:10:34] he saved me from drugs he saved me from
[1:10:37] this he brought me through that he
[1:10:39] brought me through this he he's taken me
[1:10:42] here he's got me out of this trouble he
[1:10:44] got me out of that mess he's done all
[1:10:47] these things all that got done all of a
[1:10:49] sudden I come up to one little
[1:10:52] trouble and it's all over
[1:10:57] everything
[1:10:59] he's you done to bring me to here and
[1:11:02] this is my
[1:11:04] end this is this is the finish of
[1:11:10] me wait a
[1:11:12] minute Paul said death where is your
[1:11:14] stting grave where's your Victory I
[1:11:17] still got a crown to go to you know what
[1:11:20] I mean he wasn't it wasn't his
[1:11:23] end it's not your end
[1:11:27] that's what's so
[1:11:28] beautiful you understand is that you you
[1:11:31] didn't come to this message on your
[1:11:34] own God didn't open up this third poll
[1:11:37] to you on your
[1:11:41] own you know always hear what's the
[1:11:43] third poll speak the word speak the word
[1:11:45] he spoke squirrels he did these he done
[1:11:47] what God told him to
[1:11:48] do we have a word too to
[1:11:52] speak not it's not creating a new word
[1:11:56] to
[1:11:57] speak the word
[1:11:59] already controls every circumstances
[1:12:03] your faith comes from the word you read
[1:12:07] the word the word is becomes your
[1:12:10] reality and if this circumstance is
[1:12:14] contrary to this word this word is what
[1:12:18] you believe and you call that which is
[1:12:22] not as though it is
[1:12:27] this is what he said this is what I
[1:12:30] believe this is what I speak this is the
[1:12:34] way it's going to be I don't have to
[1:12:37] wait for that circumstance to change
[1:12:40] before I believe I changed the
[1:12:44] circumstance because perfect faith is
[1:12:47] the master of every
[1:12:51] circumstance but we sit back and we look
[1:12:55] for all kinds of little signs and things
[1:12:59] to
[1:13:02] happen I'll never forget at one time a a
[1:13:06] a a sister she went to our church my
[1:13:09] church
[1:13:10] and and she had a plan in her mind that
[1:13:15] her grandchildren would get
[1:13:19] saved if I let them put their
[1:13:23] baby in our little nativity scene at
[1:13:28] church they wanted to put their live
[1:13:30] little baby in our little
[1:13:33] nativity play at
[1:13:38] church
[1:13:40] and I just felt checked you know what
[1:13:43] happens if the somebody tips the baby
[1:13:46] over the baby starts crying or the you
[1:13:48] know
[1:13:49] another there you know there's just a
[1:13:52] hundred reasons why it wasn't a good
[1:13:56] idea but to her I
[1:14:01] interrupted God's salvation
[1:14:06] plan and I thought wait a
[1:14:10] minute if the word said God give you
[1:14:13] your children then that's why you're
[1:14:16] going to get your children not cuz
[1:14:19] they're in nativity scene or not because
[1:14:22] they do this or not because they do that
[1:14:25] faith comes from the word what the word
[1:14:29] says is what is
[1:14:31] is now remember we said in perfect faith
[1:14:35] we listened to it he believes what the
[1:14:38] word said he was can't you believe what
[1:14:41] the word says you
[1:14:43] are so you you understand Peter was
[1:14:48] fine until he looked at the
[1:14:52] circumstance it's easy to be until the
[1:14:55] circumstance Rises up Peter didn't have
[1:14:59] the perfect Faith but when he was at the
[1:15:01] gate called Beautiful he had the perfect
[1:15:06] Faith now he knew he possessed it and
[1:15:10] once he possessed it he used
[1:15:16] it the word said you have the
[1:15:21] power but he says we lack the faith to
[1:15:25] use it because we're
[1:15:28] afraid of what we're
[1:15:31] believing maybe you've got a Lost Child
[1:15:34] maybe they're deep in drugs maybe
[1:15:36] they're deep in mental condition may may
[1:15:40] maybe they're they they it appears on
[1:15:44] the outside that they've totally
[1:15:46] rejected and cursed God that don't
[1:15:51] matter what's the word say what's your
[1:15:56] promise what did God promise you cuz
[1:15:59] your faith isn't going to come from
[1:16:03] rearranging the
[1:16:04] circumstances or getting a different
[1:16:09] circumstance like I said people are
[1:16:11] always trying to save Pentecostal people
[1:16:14] because they've got long hair and
[1:16:16] dresses they're the most hardened people
[1:16:19] of
[1:16:22] all they're not they already think they
[1:16:25] got it what makes you think they want
[1:16:27] what you
[1:16:28] got you're going to tell them about
[1:16:30] healing they believe about
[1:16:36] healing the Pharisees lived outlived
[1:16:39] them all Prophet
[1:16:42] said that's not what people want to see
[1:16:45] people want to see a people living by
[1:16:48] the word of God living by the word of
[1:16:53] God all things are possible ible why
[1:16:56] because I'm believing what he said and
[1:17:00] that's why faith has to have a resting
[1:17:04] place it's got to have something that it
[1:17:07] anchors to and what does faith anchor to
[1:17:11] it anchors to the
[1:17:13] word if so when we talk about the third
[1:17:16] pole speaking the word is isn't us
[1:17:19] running around speaking change to
[1:17:24] circumstance
[1:17:27] it's not walking up to a flat Tower and
[1:17:29] say be full of
[1:17:36] air you
[1:17:38] know no it's what the word of God
[1:17:43] says if the word of God says I'll make a
[1:17:46] way then you walk up to that flat turn
[1:17:49] you say the Lord will make a way
[1:17:55] that I'm I'm totally resting and
[1:17:57] trusting that God will take this
[1:18:00] circumstance by his promised word and
[1:18:03] fix
[1:18:05] it now if he airs up the tire
[1:18:09] fine or if he sends An Angel by to pump
[1:18:13] your tire up for
[1:18:16] you or whatever
[1:18:19] happens or you just might get the Jack
[1:18:21] out
[1:18:27] and put the tire
[1:18:29] on and put your religious experience
[1:18:32] back in the trunk where it
[1:18:39] belongs that that's not what it's about
[1:18:42] we promised that this church would come
[1:18:44] to this perfect
[1:18:45] Faith he promised the church was on its
[1:18:49] way he promised in why Christ speak that
[1:18:52] the church would come to the place that
[1:18:54] they'd believe every word of God that
[1:18:56] was bride
[1:18:58] material now we're into bride material
[1:19:02] he said he said that we don't get scared
[1:19:06] we don't look around we stay with God's
[1:19:09] word a Mystic to the
[1:19:12] world not
[1:19:15] unexplainable to the
[1:19:18] unbeliever but
[1:19:20] nevertheless God's
[1:19:23] word is true
[1:19:26] so remember that that go God finally got
[1:19:29] to
[1:19:31] Moses and and if he did it to
[1:19:35] Moses
[1:19:37] certainly we should take
[1:19:39] heed why are we why does God have to
[1:19:44] push us into things he already told us
[1:19:48] to
[1:19:49] do go into all the world and preach the
[1:19:52] gospel
[1:19:56] it shouldn't be so much a cry of what
[1:19:59] must I do but Lord give me wisdom on how
[1:20:03] to approach it give me the right Spirit
[1:20:07] Lord I I know I feel led to speak to
[1:20:09] this person I know I'm going overseas to
[1:20:12] do this great work give me the wisdom
[1:20:15] father to do these things give me the
[1:20:17] right approach I know I'm called to do
[1:20:20] this I know you'll be there
[1:20:24] but you got to step
[1:20:28] out and you can't be afraid that it's
[1:20:31] not
[1:20:32] you you can't keep putting yourself in
[1:20:37] the unbelieving category you can't keep
[1:20:40] making yourself unworthy did he die for
[1:20:43] your sins did he forgive your sins did
[1:20:46] he put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:20:49] Life he's our righteousness he made us
[1:20:52] worthy he made us Worthy worthy by his
[1:20:55] election he made
[1:20:58] us Able by his promise and his
[1:21:04] power I'm not able in myself but I'm
[1:21:07] able because he enabled me by my calling

[1:21:15] of my sins and by the baptism of the
[1:21:18] Holy Spirit he did it that's
[1:21:21] right now can I act upon that
[1:21:25] Jesus believed he said can't we believe
[1:21:29] we're
[1:21:30] Believers can't we believe our position
[1:21:34] can't we believe that God put us here in
[1:21:37] this day to be the bride
[1:21:40] material of perfect Faith we've seen men
[1:21:44] try it all kinds of different ways why
[1:21:46] don't we just try it the word
[1:21:49] way that's right why don't we just try
[1:21:53] it the word way believe
[1:21:57] everything he said is true study to show
[1:22:02] yourself approved read your Bible take
[1:22:04] the promises take the message live by it

[1:22:39] our sister's faith has has reached out

[1:22:50] know the Lord's moved on her she saysi
[1:22:52] want to give my life to the Lord I want
[1:22:54] to do what's right you know I want the
[1:22:57] spirit of God and and watch the
[1:23:01] miracle I it's a
[1:23:04] miracle these are the kind of Miracles I
[1:23:07] believe in I don't care how sick you are
[1:23:10] if you get well guess what if the Lord
[1:23:13] carries you going to
[1:23:21] die it's almost like praying for the
[1:23:23] sick and saying be well for a
[1:23:26] season but you know why you're supposed
[1:23:30] to want to be healed prophet of God said
[1:23:33] you got to have a reason that you want
[1:23:35] to be healed you want to be healed
[1:23:38] because your sickness is keeping you
[1:23:41] from performing what God would have you
[1:23:44] to
[1:23:45] do it's not a a key to make you UND
[1:23:49] desperate and make your life
[1:23:51] easier you know what I mean so you don't
[1:23:53] have to suffer and have any pain that's
[1:23:57] right you know it's not let's have a
[1:23:59] little easy uh Lord I need an easier
[1:24:04] life you know you had you didn't have a
[1:24:08] place to lay your head but Lord I really
[1:24:10] need a feather bed and a a goose down
[1:24:14] pillow and a real
[1:24:19] comforter if we're going to reign with
[1:24:21] them we're going to suffer with them
[1:24:25] you're healed because you want to be
[1:24:27] about God's business you got to have a
[1:24:30] reason and the reason's got to be right
[1:24:34] and Paul he sought the Lord three
[1:24:37] times and the Lord finally spoke to him
[1:24:39] and said
[1:24:41] Paul I've made you this way because my
[1:24:44] strength is made perfect and weakness
[1:24:48] and Paul said I'd rather glory in my
[1:24:50] infirmities that the power of God might
[1:24:54] be manifested so Lord bless you um I I
