Description:
I Come From God and I Go Back To God
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Evening Service: June 14,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

break the word of life to us once again we thank you for speaking to us this morning lord our desire grows from day to day we have a hunger within our heart and even as the scripture tells us that that it comes it's the time where even nature itself is growing for it's groaning for the true manifestation of the true sons of those daughters of god we ask that you guide us to lead as you speak to our hearts because you're the same yesterday today and forever we commit everything we are to you in the name of jesus christ we ask amen amen god bless you certainly good to be gathered back in the house of god man let's open our bibles in john chapter 13. uh we're gonna we're gonna read from chapter one but we're gonna skip some and uh let's just see how we go let's start from uh john chapter 13. let's start from verse from verse let's start from verse one it says now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having put in the heart of judah iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing and this is the verse that i want to focus on he says jesus knowing that the father had given him all things is given all things in his hand and that he was come from god and he went to god he raised us from sap and laid aside the garments that he and the garment then took a towel and girded himself and after pour water in the basin he began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was curded then came into simon peter and peter said unto him lord thou washed my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knoweth not but that shall know year after peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered unto him said if i wash thee not thou has no part with me simon said simon peter said unto him lord not not my feet only but my but also my hand my hands my hands and my head jesus said unto him he that is washed needed not saved to wash his feet but he is clean every with and ye are clean but not all for he knew he should betray him therefore he said he are not all clean so after he had washed the feet and had taken the garment which he was the garment and was it and taking his garment and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet you ought to watch one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should follow as i have done to you the lord had the blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seeds amen i certainly enjoyed it this morning our pastor just uh speaking about adoption and the time that we live in i i believe it's certainly the heart of every believer to become into the manifestation of what god has called us for this end time you know i don't know about you but there comes a time where we get tired of this world you know i was thinking about even myself i said i'm just tired of being human i'm just tired of working up and just doing human things and going to bed and continuing it's just tiring you go one day after another there has to be another purpose besides just being human to us and and my title tonight if i could just for a few minutes just to to speak to you tonight i want to speak on i come from god and i go back to god i come from god and i go back to god as jesus knowing the scripture says that he knew that he came that he had come from god and he went back to god in other words he was very clear in his understanding of who he was what his purpose was and what he's about to do and and and as he begin to do his work and has began to do about go about the things that he did when he woke up in the morning he had no doubt no questions about what is it that his mission was that day and i believe that sometimes we get caught up within our own minds we don't have clarity of mind and and and we go about days and sometimes there's so much confusion within our heads and i hope tonight i could just bring it in such a way we could see that as jesus even as a reader says i have given you an example that you should do as i have done unto you now i was thinking about this scripture specifically we read it every time we do foot washing and very familiar scripture reading and jesus in talking to them referring to the exact foot washing we could say he was there talking to them about these disciples and no questions they were wondering you know who's the servants and who's what and everything and and he showing humility saying that i'm the master washing your feet and everything and and you have to do the same as i have done and showing them in that concept and we can also look at it as jesus being an example not just for this particular foot washing or this was what was taking place but yet we can also look at it from the the whole bible and all his life and see the things that he accomplished and realized that he was made to be an example for us i was looking uh this afternoon i began to look at the bible and there was just things that that came to my mind that i just want to perhaps just add or complete or add to what was said this morning because that's where my inspiration came from the the when you when you think about an example someone being an example i was thinking about even how myself you know be when i was in school you will go and and perhaps they'll give you a a a an equation to solve and and within the equation they'll tell you maybe x plus y you know divide by z equals to d or whatever the case is they will give you something and this is the equation and and and and as they give it to you they'll give you an example they will take another one and they will try to put the numbers in there and solve it for you so you can see what the answer is going to be and i began to think often time even as our pastor was speaking about jesus being example this morning we realized as we look at the bible um we could look and and and and and look and and realize in the sense if we look at it in the sense of what i'm speaking about an equation when they give you an example when it comes during the exam they're not going to take the same example and give you as a question because that was just an example for you to follow but the truth behind the concept is that you can apply what you have learned from the example and get back to the same answer you can apply and follow the logic that's been applied you put this one here the number this other number was here this is how you're going to deduct it this is how you're going to get and get to the same answer so we can realize and i began to look at the bible even as our pastor was just going this morning that there are scriptures and there are things that apply to jesus him being the firstborn among many brothers that we partake into it we realize that he's the firstborn about mingy brother and he came and even as we just read about him saying that i have given you an example that you should follow we can see but we also find out that within the same bibles that there were things that were specifically attached to the life of jesus that we were not to be fulfilling in any means whatsoever in other words jesus came and he was given for for for death so we can live so his death is for us to live and we can find out that the bible also says that he was forsaken of the father so we don't have to be forsaken so jesus god didn't want us to come to him and use and go in the bible and say well you know the scripture says my god my god why is i forsaking me right now i feel forsaken no jesus fulfilled that scripture so you don't have to apply it to yourself jesus took that he was taken he was given to death he died on the roman cross with the nails and everything so we don't have to go to the cross so we'll be saved so our life can be spared in his death so we find out as we realize it jesus is basically what was given to us and and i hope this won't offend anybody jesus became what we would call is the formula by which we get the answer that we are looking for everything that we have need of jesus is the formula the word is what has been given to us because we realize that jesus is the word and is the formula that god has given us that if we can take him take what he did and take it and apply it that god will answer our prayers and so as i'm speaking on uh uh we come from god and going back to god this morning our pastor was i was just touched how he was bringing even about adoption we understand we can see here uh that it's very important we realize that election is very is is different from adoption god elected us election is the choice of god we don't have any part to do with it in fact uh you know he came and chose us we didn't even know we were chosen until he came and showed us that he chose us election is the domain of god it has nothing to do with us it happened when we were we didn't have to take and counsel with god and tell him oh please pick this one or pick that one no this is something that god does within himself and he chooses who he wants to be and where he wants to do what he wants to do with you but also we realize that but when it comes to adoption it's based upon the conduct upon the character upon our attitude and what we exhibit so it's very different so we are elected absolutely but we they they coming into adoption is the the the uh uh it's what it comes through between the tutor when you let one one listens to the tutor and follow what the tutor is teaching until you get to the place where you are completely brought into the place where the father's character is manifested into the sun that's when it takes hold so we realize that as children of god is a constant desire within our hearts to continually manifest the character of god to continually come to a place where his mind become our mind where what his desire become our desire where we continually die to ourselves until we can get into this place where he can come and use us for his kingdom jesus said i come from god and i go back to god within that statement i begin to think about it it summarizes everything about what he was and what he came to do when he woke up in the morning how he approached things in life how he dealt with him how he responded to things that came upon him it was based upon that one statement that he had a clear understanding of where he came from and where he was going and i'll say this where you know we can as our brother andy randy was preaching last wednesday says oftentimes we reason ourselves out of a lot of things i began to think well you know that was jesus and he came from god and and everything but we realized tonight that we also came from god we came from god now we can say well you know we bypass our theophany the logos and we came to be tempted but we live in a time where all the mysteries all of those things that were hidden are open there's no more mysteries everything that god planned to do from the beginning all the things that we bypassed that we didn't know anything about the that we live in the time of the revealing of that word and quickening power is here present to make you whatever you believe you can be why because the word has been open there's no excuse we couldn't say well that was jesus because he had no knowledge that same knowledge has been transferred to us in this end time so we by the word of god by faith in the word of god we can take the word of god and the holy spirit can come and quicken that word and make it a reality to us if we can sit here and realize that god has played something within this bible that we cannot attend to then we're wasting our time if he has placed something a scripture a promises lady here it said that i'm going to bring into adoption but yet he knows that we cannot get to it then what's the purpose of trying but he has given us all things he has made his word in fact he himself has come down so he can take his word and make it real unto us but madam speaks in the message what was the holy ghost given for he says i'll just read a part of it it says the church is waiting on me and you the adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection he says that when the that when the church and christ become so close together till christ become visibly visible among us and raise us and raise the dead and we go into the rapture it's saying that this is the time god is waiting upon us to come into the place we we we take the word we let him perfect our character we let the holy spirit work upon us we let him do his work so we can he can take us and bring us into a place where he's saying that where christ becomes visible among us and they can raise the dead so we can go into the rapture that's the time that we are living in that's the time that's what's before us is the rapture is the transformation of our body but before the transformation can come the character has to be established [Music] we we heard it this morning that we will come to church and yet there are very clear things that god has established that we should do as believers but yet we find reasons why we cannot do them yet we find a way to reason out of those things to do we we fail to come to the place where we can just display the obedience of the word of god within our lives so so we find out the scripture says in first timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 it says and without controversy greg is the mystery of godliness it says that god was manifested in the flesh justifying the spirit sin of angel and preached unto the gentile believe unto the world and receive up in glory now i i began to think about this great is the mystery of godliness now we you you can think about this mystery of godliness that god the mystery of godliness our brother branham keeps referring to it over and over and in every sense he speaks about we we have to understand that jesus came he was uh yet mary conceived and he was born as a moral he came and we can follow his life and and see as at a young age at the age of 12 the scripture says he was found in the temple debating with the rabbi and and showing them the scripture concerning himself so asking them questions about his own life and the thing that the scripture spoke so in other words even the very prophet is walking us slowly for us to realize that something is happening here it's coming and he's inquiring about himself well it says that it would be a virgin born and isaiah spoke this and this happened and i'm told i was born this way now he wasn't debating about anything he was telling them about the things that happened and they didn't have an answer for him so and he would uh walk him through and he said how that he was taken into egypt and and and to be saved perhaps he'll go back to the scripture and show them that the scripture says that out of israel will i call my son he began and and he he was able to see the pattern in the scripture concerning himself and what the scripture talked about him and the prophet said that he went and be and to the river jordan and he was baptized and the bible tells us that he received the holy spirit because it says that the spirit descended in the form of a dove so we can clearly see out of regardless of the challenges that he faced as a human regardless of everything that he was he was following the pattern that was laid before him in the scripture he knew that the lamb had to be washed he went and washed himself he knew that he had to be baptized he went and did that he the spirit led him into the wilderness to be tempted and he was tempted by all manner the prophet tells us that he had the right to get married he had a right to have a house and he had a right to have a family he had a right to everything that was alive he was tempted with by every manner now if by every manner within your head right now you're thinking about something and say there's absolutely no way that jesus uh could be tempted of this then you make a scripture a lie it says by every manner so every temptation that's ever come upon you he was tempted of it that's why i'll become the high priest who can be touched by the feeling of infirmity anyway uh you think about the he he he walked in the road full of dust he got thirsty he needed to drink he got tired and he needed to rest it he needed a place maybe perhaps to put his head and and everything now this is the mystery of godliness i'm not talking about jesus i'm talking about you sitting here the mystery of godliness is that god has to be manifested in a human flesh with the trial and temptation and the things just like it is right now with all the uh a trial and all of those and things that seems like this is impossible and all he he went through all of that the scripture didn't say when he went perhaps from capernaum to jerusalem he flew no he didn't fly he walked perhaps during on the road he got tired and he needed to rest a little bit this is the mystery of godliness perhaps he he walked in and he walked up on the road on a rock perhaps he hurt himself and he needed to be carried and put aside so he can look at his foot and everything that's the mystery of godliness we we probably sometimes put in our mind that the mystery of godliness is just god walking on the air and not touching anything and everything just being perfect no it was that way it had to be that way so he can manifest what he came to do and the things the situations in your life has to be the way they are they have to be going the way they're going so that the godliness can be manifested through it the mystery of godliness is god manifesting in the flesh and i believe the prophet says one place that is god in the company of human beings doing human being things and and getting involved in human being things why but it was god manifesting what he came to do what i'm says he says so we know that the prophet were in the days gone by it says today it's christ god in sandra time and diverse manner speak to the father by the prophet in the last day but it says but in the last day through his son jesus christ it says which is the holy ghost the holy spirit in us that's the mystery of godliness is that god has given us the spirit that can walk us through the word of god every day not just when we come to church but every situation there's a quickening that's there present to walk you through to guide you what you should do to lead you in the place that he wants you to be why because that's how he desired to reveal himself now i want you to think about this and i'll take it even back to our prophet they bring somebody to be prayed for and here he is and they tell him you gotta go do this and he hadn't received a vision yet he didn't go that's the mystery of godliness he didn't just go around healing everybody he just didn't walk around just doing all kinds of miracles he didn't just go around and say you are healed and i will touch you and you'll be healed and everything no he did it according to the way it was shown unto him even as jesus said that the son do nothing except what the father shows him in other words he was comfortable he was he had no conflict whatsoever in the position that he was between the man flesh that he was and the spirit that dwell within the flesh the spirit had control over the flesh and he did nothing except what the father showed him you know i began to think that's the problem with me sometimes i i began to think about every trouble i've ever been in is because of my flesh every uh a place anything i've done wrong is because i didn't hit through the spirit i followed the flesh any time i thought it's something oh no i should do this and i didn't hear through the spirit that's when he ended up in something terrible but all we have been given the promise that there's gonna come quickening power even at this end time because remember this is not just the holy spirit falling on this is not pentecost but this is the adoption where we can become or brought into the place where our thoughts becomes or god's thoughts become our thoughts god's mind become our mind whatever he desire becomes what he did what we desire in fact it takes us to the place where if he tells us not to say it we don't say it it don't matter how many people will ridicule you if god didn't tell me to do it i won't do it that's the place that we need to get to often time we you know you you've been looking in a prophet's life he got uh he did things just because people put pressure on him and that's what he got in trouble the most was because he was under pressure because things i think about pressure that we go through every day how we do things under pressure good or bad we realize that we're not supposed to do that way so it says which is the holy spirit in us it continues on it says it says arise and shine for the light has come the word light is vindicated again the light vindicated again god's word so that you can see god manifested manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age this promise hasn't been ma these promises that's made for this day these promises that was said to that was said by the prophet by jesus himself that in that day god in standard time hebrews chapter 1 it says god in sunday time in diverse manners spoke to the father through the prophet but in the last day through his son god is speaking to his sons in this age and others the manifestation of god as we said is the right manifestation for this hour it's a group of people that have been set aside here to manifest what god intends to manifest in this generation a group of people that have been set aside elected being brought into this adoption where they say nothing except what he tells them to say now the i was watching the scripture speaks and i thought this was very interesting but random speaks in a message shalom it says it speaks about the great light it says it says that the great light that hung upon the wilderness which was which which was that moses forsook egypt esteemed the great reproach of christ greater than the treasure the the treasures of egypt it says that same one that met saul on the road on the road down to damascus a great light that hung before him the same light that same pill of fire soul being a hebrew would never worship anything anything spiritual or anything or call it lord in this position he was in the position that he was in he would say lord who are you he said i'm jesus it says that same light has come to what to manifest to manifest to make known to the people the promise that is made for today for this day manifested light of of the day the darkness is dark is darkened we we know that in in in this message adoption evidence or pastors going through it it is said that it's not for the unbeliever this is the calling for the believers those that are elected those that have been baptized with the holy ghost are the ones that are going to be placed and we know that he came and and he specifically uh said that that message was for for the elect for the ones that are elected and placed i'm sorry those that are elected with the holy spirit so they could be placed and and you look at it we look at it from the standpoint of jesus we see how that he came he was being he was born he went to be baptized and he had the goalie the holy spirit and he was tempted and now we see him go to the cross uh uh we see him i'm sorry we see him go to the mountain of transfiguration where the adoption took place and what one of them uses that to say he says in romans 8 and 1 and 17 it says you are born of the spirit of god and therefore you should not walk in flesh but walk after the spirit it says it's the it's for the believer the position you it's for you to know your position in christ and why is it that we know our position in christ it's we we understand in the world that we live in that you cannot operate effectively unless you know exactly what you're supposed to do if if a person is doubting about what they're supposed to do or not sure if they should do what they're doing it is never empowering for you to do that thing but when you've come into the realization that i have been elected that this is where i've been placed for me to function you you are much more confident and that's where uh uh power is given for you to operate effectively so god is wanting to place us to bring us into a place where we can bring the manifestation of this hour exactly the way he want us to bring why because we have we have been uh elected here we are baptized with the holy spirit and is placing us to the place where he would want us to be effective for the kingdom where we can do some good for the kingdom where we can uh uh do something in order to prolong the kingdom or to continue the kingdom the place where he can come and use us and know that it's in harmony with what he had chosen us to do he says he says now in the message here he him but when he makes this statement he says now our lord jesus as we as as we are speaking of him i love to read i love to read after him because he never made one mistake everything he done was perfect in harmony with god and how much time he he says how much time that we waste as as we leisure around he says but he never found you never found jesus at no time ever was as we call uh uh getting around every move every place that he went everything that he did everywhere that he spoke had a meaning to it and was exactly in harmony with god and the will of god it says that's the reason he was so pleased with him saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased everything was perfectly in harmony with him and and i believe that's the desire of our hearts tonight is that armor need to be developed by the hearing of the word by the obedience to the word you know i believe our greatest hindrance sometimes even as a messenger told us is ourselves because we get to the place like i said we get under pressure we get all those things and we fail under those circumstances to obey what the word tells us to do but oh if we can go past the pressure if we can go past the temptation pass and get to the place where that relationship is in such a way that it don't matter what people say it don't matter what you think but you act according to what he has told you to do i believe that perfect harmony will be there the scripture is full of account even as a read it it says about calling us to return back to god and and and you can look at it but i want to make so many statements i didn't have time to to uh uh take them all and and you know most of this that we cannot go to god unless we were with him first you cannot return to something that you were not there before so but yet the scripture is calling us back to return to god it still is putting us in a position where uh because this world is built in such a way and and oftentimes we have to be reminded that we are not here as just sinners trying to please god and go to heaven even as our pastor was speaking this morning it's very important we realize that we are the elected people we are that seed of god he wants us to operate from the standpoint that we understand that we are elected and we are chosen to be here because otherwise you keep going back to there again you keep going back to question do i have the seed am i really the seed no that's not the question you let the seed if the seed was buried you live it in there you don't touch it you believe and you continue forward so the enemy wants us to constantly be questioning something that god has taken care of but he wants us to operate in the place that if uh when i'm already the seed what should i be producing i am the seed what should i be producing so as we read now i want you to hear in isaiah 44 verse 21 to 22 he says oh remember all ye jacob and israel for thou are my servant and i have formed thee thou are my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me i have blotted out as a thick cloud that transgression and as a cloud that's seen return unto me for i have redeemed thee so in other words god is wanting us to operate into the standpoint where we have a complete understanding that we are sons and daughters of god he wants us to know that and to have that constantly in our mind as we are operating never to come to a place where well i'm just a sinner no he died for you so you don't have to call yourself a sinner we want to come and approach him in the standpoint that i have received the seed and i believe that i've been chosen and i'm here to do what he called me to do so he says oh return unto me what the purpose for returning is because they were chosen he tells them remember o jacob thou are my servant i have formed thee he made them to be what they were he says return unto me for i have redeemed thee it speaks in jeremiah chapter 3 and 14 it says return all backsliding children say unto the lord for i am marrying for i am married unto you and i will take you one seat one of this city one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you unto i will bring you to zion in jeremiah 4 and 1 it says if that will return all israel say the lord return unto me and if that will put away thy abomination out of thy sight it says then will thou not be removed now it's wanting us reminding us again that when as we come when god has come and and brought us out he's returning us back to something that he wants to achieve because he realized that the mystery of god is that god wants to restore the condition that exists in the garden of eden when satan came in and caused the fall god is working towards the return of the kingdom so he can establish his kingdom back the way it was so we are not coming in as sinners into a kingdom we are coming back as sons and daughters as we were with him i was thinking about the prodigal son the scripture speaks now this prodigal son was a son before he left he was a son before he left and he was aware of who he was and here he comes and there's a son and and if i could just use that type and say that the the uh the scripture says that he he was going he went into a far country sin dragged him away the lust of the flesh and and everything the messenger tells us that when man sin it says the spirit didn't sin because if man had remained a spirit there was no way that it was gonna sin but what caused sin was the fact that it was put into a body of flesh it was put into a body of flesh and the woman who came out of him was part of the byproduct and the enemy used that so he can cause the fall but it says the spirit didn't sin now so when the flesh that's what brought the confusion no wonder we have such confusion today why because it was through the flesh every time the enemy comes it comes through the flesh so he could tempt us and all those things he says through the lust of the flesh and the the the pride and the the eye and all those things that's the outlet that the enemy comes in through our lives so he can tempt us but we realize that when god came now he is the man has come into sin it says but the spirit even in his fallen state there was something in adam desiring that returned to the place he knew something about this place about this relationship he knew something about what he was to be a god something that just was within him he just knew because remember he was made god over the earth and god was god over the universe he just knew even though he lost it he just knew about something about being god is another thing that happened even with us yet we are in sin and all of those yet there's something within us to just know that this is not right it's just asking for the perfect condition this cannot be all that it is this is not it why because there is something that desires to return to god but it says god put that in you and we want to make sure that we use that so we can return back to the place that god is calling us so we find out this prodigal son dragged away into a fall country in sin and he squandered everything that he had even as the scripture tells us and he lost everything that he had and he was in sin and and he came until the place where he didn't have a place to sleep all the people that he taught were friends they ran away from him all of the ones that caused him to come out there were no way to be found and he continue on he continue on and he finally finds himself in a pig pen what a place what a place he finds himself in a pig planet a big pen and and over there with pigs and and just just wrestling and and fighting for food the scripture says that one day he came back to himself when he came back to himself the first thing that he knows that he's a son now he didn't think he realized that this is not who i am i am made to be a son i was made i was created a son and the scripture says when he came back to himself he said i'll go back to my father it says even the servant in my father's house they have better food than theirs it says i will return my father even if if he can only take me as a servant but oh i tell you in the kingdom of his father there was no way absolutely that he a son can come and return as a servant as that was a type of god that when his son has gone out and is returning there is no way that son can take a different place except the place i was predestinated for him to be in we can be made servant we are called to be sons we are called to be daughters of god we are called to be gods and to reign with him we are god we are called to have dominion upon the things that are upon us where greatness is the mystery of godliness we are called to manifest god within this flesh that's why i begin my statement and just say i'm just tired of this world i'm just tired of being a human every time you work up it's human thinking and it's human thinking upon human thinking it's adding and subtracting and and dividing and it doesn't add up and go try to put more calls and do this i would just want to work up and i'm thinking as god that's a desire for my heart just to see the god out of me and says that semi says it's the adoption time god is waiting for you and i why and how does he start it starts with the desire within your heart for you to desire to see god within your flesh it starts with his your desire and god coming and making that desire reality we couldn't desire it unless it was somewhere that god could bring it to come to pass it says in jeremiah 24 and 5 he said again the word of the word of the lord came unto me saying thou saith the lord the god of israel like this good fig so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive into jew of judah captive of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good for i will set mine eyes upon them for good now i want you to think about that i will set my night upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land it means that we're there before we're not going to a strange place we're going to a place that we've been before i wonder when we begin to see that place we'll just recognize it yeah i remember this i remember this just like that little the young man who was lost and he went to the war and he had amnesia but yet they began to take him and and they were with him in the train and they'd be they let him wander and he began to walk he says no dude go and take him he said no just leave him living by himself he began to walk and he began to lock it he began to walk it and finally just sits the tower and something just rings a bell he says i know that i'm telling you that's the path because they say these things are not given so we can apply it to other people it's been given so we can apply it every step of the way why god is dropping hints upon you so you can say oh if i recognize it it's him showing it to me if i recognize it it's him showing it to me how do you with this everything that's happening how do you come to the right mind to decide what's right and what's wrong everything people have lost their minds there's no basis of of of even measuring and and it's just any time something is mentioned this group pulls that way that group there's no room for anybody to listen to anybody but oh i'm so thankful that we have a word of god that can just come and say i recognize what he's saying this is what i desire i don't desire anything happening out there i want to be exactly as he promised that i'll be in the end time why because it's god calling you it's the prodigal son recognizing this is not what i was called to be and the scripture says that when he came back the fredo hogan has a fist he said that they will go and put a rope upon him now it wasn't they they didn't welcome him just as a the father didn't say well you know you already squandered what was your part so there's nothing left for you you're just gonna go and work with the servants and everything no you know why because the father always have enough the father always have enough you can never exhaust the wealth of the father he has enough for every one of his sons if you are a son you have a place if you are a daughter you have a place he's met an inheritance for every single one of us in fact he counted every single one of us before he can go pay the price he counted it says and he called you by name he counted and says i know this one i know this one i know this one he didn't say well god i remember the meaning sentence that i have no he called you by name and then once he counted all the name he says now i'll go pay the price for all of this that i just counted it's the father's pleasure to say for him for him to give you the kingdom it's the father desire to give you the kingdom it's not his kingdom he didn't want it god didn't create the earth so he can come and rule upon the earth that was not his intention he created it so his sons and daughters can rule upon it he created it for adam and if we can come to a place and realize why am i asking for this because the father wants me to have it you don't ask for anything that the father don't desire for you to have he says in the church age it says oh after after reading john chapter 5 and 19 it says as we talked about the armor and he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and the bride he shows her his word of life and she receives it i think that's simple but that's very important because this word has been shown to a lot of people and they haven't received it this word has been shown to a lot of people some have acknowledged it oh i see i see what you mean but no way to find the application of it the application of it comes in the obedience you know i was thinking about many people want they they want something big to happen they want some great event for for it to shake them but that's not the promise for the bride because brother branham says that it's not the government forces that will move the bride it says it's the word that moves the bride it's to receive the word that we have received now california can sing today it don't mean anything in regards to where we have to be with the word is it going to sink absolutely because there was a promise that is going to sink but we can't be sitting in a place where our clocks are turned towards and say okay is it singing how far is it santa no we have to be in the word so that the things that the word has promised will come to pass within our lives and i began to think just how even simple the rapture would be and people will miss it you know i i was i remember going to a you know a training training with someone and you know they show me what what we had to do goodness it was very intimidating lights flashing over here this part doing this and not part doing that and i'm like there's no way we could put this together there's no i don't think i have enough time to learn and remember all of this but the person told me said you know don't just everything that you've seen and everything just don't worry about it let's go back to it took a pen and a paper remember this remember this remember this remember this it says you do this here you do this here you do this here in other words what i'm saying is it's not this great gigantic event that we have to sit and worry about that is coming and when it's going to come and everything no the secret lies in the preparation and the things that are done on the daily basis basically he told me just go ahead and you just do this part don't worry about this other part just do this make sure you know how to do it i did it as i he says can you do it again i said yes okay move here can you do this now i said yeah i could do it and can you do that and then i was able to do it and pretty soon i was able to do all of those little things and then it produced the same thing that i was scared of looking the rapture will come will happen by us doing exactly what we're doing right now coming to church praying to god and working up in the morning seeking for his face letting him guide you in the morning waking up and taking care of this and doing this and you don't have to go find anything anywhere else it's in the word it's in the obedience in the word it's by following what he said it's by walking with him every day it's by doing all of those things the smaller things that adds to the big thing it's not it's not for us to look into the domain that doesn't belong to us we concentrate on the domain that we have been given which is the obedience to the word you know you think about jesus even we can even take it to a prophet here he is and in one situation he's able to raise a dead baby to raise a dead person he walks into a different situation a sick person he doesn't know what to do because nothing had been shown to him people want him to do he said well all i could do is just pray i haven't been shown anything i i can't i cannot if he hadn't shown me he said my own mom my own mother he said he didn't show me anything i couldn't go and say mom stand up and i said i'll just continue to pray it was hit to him and i'm saying that to just show that it's in the humility it's in those even somewhat the picture of weakness somewhat a picture seems like this person doesn't know or it seems like he's confused at times and all those things yet in that is manifested the greatest power that we've ever seen why because when the thing was shown it was confidence that was put on the display when it wasn't shown it was the word that was applied the word says to do this i'll do exactly what the word says if i don't understand i'll just do what the word says but when i come to the place where it's clearly revealed to me then i will apply exactly what he wants me to say why it's god the mystery of godliness god revealing the human flesh if the musician could come because if we're not mistaken people will think the image of god or going back to god is us walking on the air and just healing everybody and standing up the dead and doing all of that no is to come to a place where whether it be ridicule whether it be criticism whether it be anything it doesn't move you what moves you is what he says for you to do let's all stand let's just bar heads i mean i trusted your desire because it's truly my desire that that adoption may be manifested in my life that i can get to a place where it's just me and him i don't care what anybody thinks i don't think i don't care what if people think i lost my mind that's fine with me but the desire is lord is this what you really want me to do then i'll go do it where pressure means nothing where temptation can be overcome because the desire and the promises that that power will come and cause us to be overcomers [Music] gracious father that's all desire tonight lord lord i raise my hand and we pray to you lord lord that we may come to the place lord and you didn't give us the holy spirit so we could just go run around and do whatever we wanted with it but you gave us so you can bring us to that placing that place where we could be so obedient so listening about the father's work the desire of the father what the father desire becomes what burns it within our souls look like the scripture speaks about the servants of david a desire to drink from a fountain from a well oh god they took the sword and went and fulfilled the desire of the king and when they brought water the king took it and he poured it on the floor on the ground because he realized he was not even worthy to drink it lord we want to be that way lord when we hear your word and something within our heart just want to go out and fulfill every bit of it until you are satisfied to see it come to pass within ours [Music] give us strength guide us and lead us lord where we have fallen short give us strength so we can overcome and stand and walk according to your way we love you we commit everything into your hands and ask us things in the name of jesus christ amen it's manifesting [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] it's a lovely [Music] [Music] play [Music] is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh

things that we have to attend to of the flesh the things of work and school and life but as brother billy said lord may we start to take on your thoughts lord may we start to wake up lord and see and wonder lord what you have for us lord we know there's many sermons out there lord that speak to who we are we know there's a bible lord and written form lord that tells us who we are and then you use the holy spirit lord to convict our hearts and to lead us and guide us pray lord as we start to see who we are lord may we just step forth in those visions or that you have of us we know that time is wrapping up or we know there are things that are the last minute prophecies lord are taking place lord help us to step into the vision we know lord that as we just get farther down the road lord you have more and more things for us may we have the understanding and the revelation that you want us to see or we ask that you would just be with this church lord be with each individual or we know there's a collective body around the world lord that is positioning themselves getting ready for the rapture helpless lord to have that faith give us that eyesight that we could see but we commit all things into your hands and we ask these things in jesus name [Music] and i wanna be standing by your [Music] oh this is this is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] i surrendered [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh this is [Music] oh [Music]
