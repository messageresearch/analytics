[6:34] [Music]
[6:40] for the past three months i was having
[6:43] lower abdominal pain
[6:46] and
[6:47] i was just praying hoping that i would
[6:49] just pray it away
[6:51] and then my daughter finally said mom
[6:53] you need to go to the doctor
[7:03] so i went to the doctor and the doctor
[7:06] said we need to do blood work first
[7:09] so the blood we came the the results
[7:13] and
[7:14] he said that the blood count is good
[7:17] and
[7:18] my
[7:19] metabolism also he said it was good
[7:22] so for
[7:23] like three four days i was feeling good
[7:27] i didn't have abnormal pain and i was so
[7:29] happy that it has gone away
[7:32] and then on a saturday
[7:35] early morning i started feeling the pain
[7:37] again
[7:38] so the pain
[7:40] wasn't gone
[7:42] so i went back to the doctor
[7:45] and then the doctor said we need to do
[7:47] further tests now
[7:48] so he said i must go for a ct scan
[7:52] and a call on a screening colonoscopy
[7:56] so
[7:58] i was drop
[8:00] so
[8:01] i went to google i dropped my symptoms
[8:04] and
[8:05] i began to feel so nervous i got so
[8:08] confused
[8:10] and and also i was wondering why i'm
[8:14] going for colon
[8:15] screening
[8:17] so now um
[8:19] i went for a ct scan
[8:22] and then
[8:23] a few days later i started preparing for
[8:26] the colonoscopy
[8:29] that was on wednesday
[8:31] and then
[8:33] thursday to take time off so that i
[8:35] could go
[8:37] for the
[8:38] screening so
[8:40] [Music]
[8:41] i went in there and they prepped me
[8:44] and the nurse was asking me she was so
[8:46] nice and she was asking me if there's
[8:48] anything i need
[8:50] i said they need prayer just pray for me
[8:53] that's all i need right now
[8:56] so when i went into the theater
[9:00] okay
[9:03] when i came back
[9:05] they called me to a private room and i
[9:08] was so nervous about it because i didn't
[9:10] know what to expect
[9:12] so the doctor said
[9:15] he found a polyp in my colon
[9:18] two millimeters
[9:20] and then he said but he didn't find any
[9:22] cancer
[9:23] so i'm so thankful about that
[9:29] i want to sing this song
[9:34] when i look back
[9:36] on history
[9:38] see the mighty god unveiled
[9:43] proving over and over
[9:46] that is what
[9:48] can never fail
[9:51] but i can't keep on dwelling on some
[9:56] past memory
[10:00] he's the same god
[10:03] who's living
[10:04] in me
[10:07] [Music]
[10:09] the same god who spoke to
[10:14] the woman
[10:18] the same god does wonders
[10:22] too
[10:23] many to tell
[10:27] the same
[10:28] god who
[10:30] parted the
[10:32] raging red sea
[10:35] [Music]
[10:38] he's the same god
[10:40] who's living
[10:42] in me
[10:47] the same god who created
[10:51] all the heavens and all thy earth
[10:56] who came back living in jesus
[11:00] there was power
[11:02] in his word
[11:04] but
[11:05] now
[11:06] in this last days
[11:08] i'm
[11:10] beginning to see
[11:13] he's the same god
[11:15] who's living
[11:17] in me
[11:22] the same god we spoke to
[11:31] [Music]
[11:35] too many to tell
[11:39] the same god who parted
[11:44] the
[11:45] raging red sea
[11:47] [Music]
[11:50] he's the same
[11:52] god who's living
[11:55] in me
[12:04] amen why don't we just sing that cross
[12:06] the same god
[12:15] [Music]
[12:43] is
[12:45] [Music]

[20:00] we got up close this morning huh you

[20:09] call get in the front row
[20:11] amen let's read together do you love the
[20:13] lord
[20:14] i thought this morning as we came i i
[20:16] thought of that song they come from the
[20:18] east and west you know
[20:20] and kind of we come from the east and
[20:23] west we come from the streets and
[20:25] parking lots so far
[20:27] amen making our way to the house of the
[20:30] lord it'll get better soon
[20:32] paul an apostle of jesus christ
[20:35] by the will of god
[20:37] to the saints which are at ephesus
[20:41] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[20:47] grace
[20:48] be to you
[20:49] and peace
[20:51] from god our father
[20:53] and from the lord jesus
[20:56] christ
[20:57] blessed be the god and father of our
[21:00] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[21:04] with all spiritual blessings
[21:06] in heavenly places
[21:08] in christ heavenly father we ask you to
[21:11] bless your word to us
[21:13] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[21:17] amen god bless you may be seated
[21:26] i have a little
[21:29] something on my heart this morning and
[21:31] i'm going to
[21:33] maybe kind of take up
[21:36] a long way around to get there
[21:39] but
[21:40] the purpose of it is that
[21:44] to to make us a aware
[21:47] of
[21:48] something
[21:50] and
[21:52] and the great things that
[21:55] uh
[21:56] god has for us
[21:59] and i kind of like to
[22:02] talk a little bit
[22:04] this morning if i could
[22:07] about
[22:09] our
[22:10] our position
[22:12] in christ
[22:14] now we
[22:16] we
[22:16] kind of think of that word position a
[22:19] lot of times like a job
[22:23] you know what's our
[22:25] our job or
[22:27] or what's our ranking
[22:29] but i want to take it more from
[22:32] this aspect if i could
[22:35] is
[22:37] where that he has placed us in himself
[22:42] and
[22:42] and how he did it and why he did it
[22:46] and and so by
[22:49] taking that pathway
[22:51] to get to what it is
[22:53] that we want to say
[22:56] to uh
[22:57] stir us up
[22:59] this morning if if we could uh
[23:03] we could do it that way
[23:05] and so as as uh
[23:08] christians the first thing we realize
[23:12] is that uh
[23:14] god has great and marvelous promises
[23:18] do you understand that so he's given us
[23:22] great and precious promises
[23:25] so
[23:26] so we talk about where he positioned us
[23:29] he positioned us to be recipients
[23:32] of his promises his great and
[23:35] exceedingly great and precious promises
[23:38] that by these promises that we could
[23:42] become
[23:43] partakers of divine nature
[23:46] so if i promise you something
[23:49] and and you believe that promise and you
[23:52] call upon that promise
[23:54] and that promise comes to pass
[23:57] in in your life
[23:59] and
[24:00] you now realize that god is a god that
[24:04] keeps his word
[24:06] then you are our partaker
[24:08] of that promise
[24:11] uh
[24:12] as i think as dylan
[24:14] sitting here when he became very very
[24:17] sick none of us really could understand
[24:20] how sick that he was we knew that he was
[24:23] in the hospitals but when he came to
[24:27] the doors of death
[24:30] it you remember his testimony how that
[24:32] he called out upon the lord
[24:35] and the lord heard his cry
[24:38] and and then when when the lord came
[24:41] down and touched him and healed him and
[24:44] delivered him and restored him back
[24:47] he now uh stood up and he testified how
[24:51] that he partook
[24:53] of that that the greatness of god's
[24:57] healing that he had a a drink from that
[25:01] fountain
[25:03] and so god's given us many great and
[25:07] marvelous
[25:09] promises and
[25:10] so they're just unfailing promises
[25:14] there are even there are even more
[25:17] unfailings than heavens and earth
[25:19] because the scripture says heavens and
[25:22] earth will pass away but god's word will
[25:25] never pass away
[25:28] so he's given us something that's so
[25:30] solid
[25:32] and so strong
[25:34] and so precious to lay a hold of his
[25:38] word do you know that we could live by
[25:41] the word of god alone amen that's right
[25:44] everything that we have need of is in
[25:47] the word of god the word of god said
[25:49] that a righteous person wouldn't beg
[25:51] bread
[25:52] you could live by that promise that he
[25:55] said that he'd supply your every need
[25:59] i i i don't know why that we're so
[26:02] easily shaken to fear
[26:05] when of all people we've to be the least
[26:09] fearful
[26:10] because the word of god tells us if god
[26:13] before us who could be against us
[26:17] maybe the only question would rise in
[26:20] our heart is whether that god was for us
[26:24] or not
[26:25] but if we could understand what he done
[26:27] for us and where he placed us and how he
[26:31] positioned us and all that he's done for
[26:34] us and all that he has for him
[26:36] this morning if you're lacking in any
[26:40] form we are definitely not here to
[26:44] condemn you for the condition that we're
[26:47] in you're in but we're here to give you
[26:49] the good news
[26:51] that he is here more and abundantly able
[26:56] to do that above which you can even ask
[26:59] her thing
[27:01] no matter how dark
[27:03] the clouds have rolled in or how
[27:05] difficult he makes it
[27:08] or or the amount of failures that you
[27:11] have piled up against yourself he's
[27:14] greater
[27:15] than the record that the enemy has
[27:18] against you
[27:21] so we can rest on those
[27:24] uh
[27:25] promises
[27:27] this morning that he will do what he
[27:29] said he would do
[27:32] you got to realize that he'll always do
[27:35] what he said he's do now you might miss
[27:37] it and you might walk away from it or
[27:39] you might not look for it
[27:42] but he's there
[27:43] he's always on time
[27:45] he's always where he said he would be he
[27:48] has never failed
[27:50] amen amen i know he's never failed me
[27:53] i wish i could say it the same
[27:56] but he's a good god and
[27:59] um
[28:01] and so and so he said that so we know
[28:04] that these unfailing things so we have
[28:06] an unfailing word
[28:08] you understand that we have unfailing
[28:11] promises
[28:13] and and this little sermon came on my
[28:15] heart it's it was
[28:17] preached in 1955 it's called the
[28:20] believer's position in christ and
[28:22] there's some things in here that i
[28:23] thought were very good
[28:25] that would be very needful for myself
[28:28] and
[28:29] and then i would like to share them with
[28:31] you
[28:32] but
[28:34] so we have these great
[28:37] these all this word of god if i could
[28:40] say that i can i i
[28:43] it it's it's so marvelous
[28:46] and it's so far-reaching
[28:49] and there's no place in our life that it
[28:51] won't reach
[28:53] there's there's no situation that it
[28:56] doesn't have the answer to
[28:58] there's no family problem
[29:01] no
[29:02] a relationship problem no
[29:05] financial problem no health problem or
[29:09] everything that means this word searches
[29:12] all in all
[29:14] and so we can surely find that but so
[29:18] when you look at all this word
[29:20] that we have and we have
[29:23] volumes of it in our age
[29:26] revealed to us
[29:28] that we are in a blessed age in a
[29:31] blessed people
[29:32] because god has placed us in the time of
[29:35] the revealing of his word
[29:38] the things that were hid
[29:40] the the pieces of the puzzle that
[29:43] couldn't fit together how people
[29:45] couldn't understand what the evidence of
[29:48] the spirit of the indwelling spirit was
[29:52] what the power of forgiveness of sins
[29:54] was what grace was what the evidence of
[29:57] the spirit was how
[30:00] all the great things of the book of life
[30:02] and of predestination all these things
[30:05] that that man had been groping at and
[30:08] been trying to place together and fit
[30:11] within their heart
[30:13] god in this last day by his infinite
[30:16] wisdom
[30:17] spoke in the scriptures that he would
[30:20] send forth a prophet to the gentile age
[30:25] and he would be in the same spirit of
[30:28] the spirit of elijah that came
[30:31] in times before
[30:33] and that he would come to the gentiles
[30:37] and once again before the gentile church
[30:41] if i could use the word impersonate or
[30:45] or bring to the gentile church the same
[30:49] ministry of the son of man
[30:51] in the same manner
[30:53] in the same works
[30:56] in the same signs and wonders so the
[30:58] gentile church wouldn't be without
[31:01] witness
[31:02] so just as jesus stood in his day as a
[31:06] man
[31:07] when you looked at jesus you saw a man
[31:10] there was no beauty in him to be desired
[31:13] there was nothing about him that set him
[31:16] apart from anybody else until he spoke
[31:22] and then when he spoke
[31:24] they said no man speaketh like this man
[31:28] no in fact they marveled the scripture
[31:31] says that they came to him and they said
[31:34] how how does this man know no letters
[31:38] being unlearned
[31:39] well how why do you think he knew those
[31:42] letters he's the author
[31:44] hey amen
[31:47] and so
[31:48] he stood on this earth and he did the
[31:50] signs he did the works he discerned the
[31:53] thoughts and intents of the heart he
[31:55] meant the woman at the well he raised it
[31:57] all those signs and wonders that were
[32:00] done in the form of flesh
[32:04] in the form of a prophet
[32:06] so when you looked at jesus you saw a
[32:09] prophet
[32:10] without divine revelation you wouldn't
[32:13] have known that he was the son of god
[32:15] that was what god was going to reveal
[32:18] and build his church on but when they
[32:21] looked at him they saw a man
[32:23] and so in seeing this man
[32:26] they they they knew that god was with
[32:29] them
[32:30] rabbi no man could do these works lest
[32:32] god be with them
[32:34] okay and so that was his ministry
[32:38] well the gentile church was without that
[32:41] ministry
[32:42] a witness of that ministry so in the
[32:45] last days the lord jesus christ raised
[32:48] up a prophet
[32:50] he was born a prophet he was gifted a
[32:53] prophet he had his consciences so close
[32:56] together he could step in those realms
[32:59] god could speak to him lift the ear he
[33:01] was a man
[33:04] but yet god
[33:06] veiled himself
[33:08] in that man and did the same works
[33:11] amongst us that the lord jesus christ
[33:14] did
[33:16] so that
[33:17] we could
[33:18] know
[33:19] and understand and that he could break
[33:22] to us
[33:23] truths
[33:25] and revelations that was hid
[33:28] that's the privileged people
[33:31] that you are
[33:33] so that's where he has placed you
[33:39] in him amen
[33:43] in time he chose you
[33:45] to place you
[33:48] to be
[33:49] here
[33:51] to hear this word
[33:53] this message that he could share with
[33:56] you
[33:57] truths and revelations
[34:00] and
[34:02] and things that were hid
[34:04] from
[34:06] people of all other ages
[34:09] marvelous it's called the election amen
[34:12] as
[34:13] if we would read the next verse in
[34:15] script in ephesians
[34:18] it says according as he hath chosen us
[34:22] in him
[34:24] before the foundations of the world that
[34:27] we should be holy and without blame
[34:30] before him in
[34:32] love chosen
[34:35] what a beautiful place so in looking at
[34:38] this word of god we'd like to say this
[34:41] this morning
[34:43] excuse me my
[34:45] i get to thinking about election and it
[34:48] causes me to tear up a little bit
[34:51] because i can't believe he picked me
[34:55] there's so many reasons he
[34:58] he shouldn't have
[35:00] you know what i mean and and
[35:03] and and the number of times that i've
[35:06] turned my back on him and
[35:08] walked away is innumerable
[35:11] but yet he never let me
[35:14] go amen he kept reaching his arm out
[35:18] kept reaching his arm out kept reaching
[35:20] his arm out and he said he says i'll not
[35:23] leave you i'll not forsake you i'll be
[35:26] with you even in you till the end
[35:29] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[35:32] my hand if i've started a work in you
[35:35] i'll finish it till the end
[35:37] amen that's where he placed us in him
[35:42] he said but the main thing is
[35:46] if we can find
[35:49] where god's word belongs in our
[35:54] life
[35:59] now the responsibility is beginning to
[36:03] shift to us
[36:05] because he wants fellowship with us
[36:09] he just didn't lay something out there
[36:12] to believe
[36:13] like a catechism
[36:16] or or doctrines or or a history book
[36:20] he's always wanted to be personal
[36:23] he always wanted to be a relationship
[36:27] he he didn't want just a church of
[36:30] people
[36:31] that all believe the same we're not here
[36:34] believing all the same
[36:36] our revelations differ
[36:38] our understandings of god's differ our
[36:41] experience differ that's not what he was
[36:44] looking for he was looking for us each
[36:48] to take on the mind of him
[36:50] that the love of god would be shed
[36:52] abroad in our heart by his spirit
[36:55] and so we find out that we want to
[36:59] we want to find out where the word of
[37:02] god belongs in our life
[37:06] that's personal
[37:10] it's there
[37:12] it's on books it's on tapes it's in the
[37:14] scriptures it's recorded
[37:17] it's everywhere but now you've got to
[37:18] ask the question where does this belong
[37:21] in my life
[37:26] because there's there's there's there's
[37:28] things that are yours
[37:29] and let me read on a little bit if i
[37:32] could
[37:33] if you would allow me
[37:35] he says god sets times
[37:37] and time limits
[37:40] and
[37:41] and then it works all
[37:44] to
[37:45] that time
[37:48] just think of that god sets times times
[37:51] he's going to do things
[37:53] time limits time
[37:56] that things are going to end
[37:59] so he he he said that god god
[38:03] you know
[38:05] it's kind of to where i'm going but
[38:07] uh
[38:10] the lack of god's not irresponsible
[38:13] if i could say that he practices what he
[38:16] preaches so he set a time for this and a
[38:20] time for that so he has a time he has a
[38:23] season he has time limits he he knew
[38:27] certain things were going to go for
[38:29] so long
[38:31] and and so he sets those things in and
[38:34] he's got a time and he says
[38:36] uh many of them before the coming of the
[38:39] lord
[38:41] there was many false teachings and said
[38:44] this is the messiah and false things
[38:47] taken place according to the scriptures
[38:49] just before the coming of the lord
[38:53] so there was a sense
[38:55] that something was fixing to happen
[38:58] you under understand that and and and
[39:02] therefore but god had a time for it
[39:05] he had a time limit in other words he
[39:08] has a time when dispensations come to an
[39:11] end he has the time that things end and
[39:14] a time that things began
[39:17] and so he he has a time now because let
[39:20] me say this he's got a time in your life
[39:22] also
[39:23] he's got a time that things are going to
[39:26] transpire in your life so just stay with
[39:30] me just a moment if if you could
[39:33] he says
[39:34] he says but and people try to do it
[39:37] within themselves they try to make god's
[39:41] word
[39:42] fit their program
[39:46] now this is a
[39:47] little tremendous section here
[39:50] but
[39:53] the purpose of it is is to bring us back
[39:57] into contact
[39:59] that we just can't be drifting
[40:05] we can't just let the days roll by
[40:09] and time go by
[40:11] and and not
[40:13] understand that god's program is still
[40:17] at work
[40:18] so we've got to find out where does that
[40:21] fit
[40:22] in our lives where does the word of god
[40:25] fit in me what is the word of god trying
[40:28] to
[40:29] transform me
[40:31] into
[40:34] he said so
[40:35] he says so people try to do it
[40:38] uh
[40:39] and they try to make the word of god fit
[40:41] into their program we're gonna go on
[40:43] that just for a little bit
[40:45] he says but that you got it vice versa
[40:48] you've got to fit
[40:50] in god's program
[40:53] we find that's true
[40:56] now we take moses as an example
[41:00] of god's time
[41:02] now moses
[41:04] he knew
[41:05] and he came to the realization that
[41:08] there was a calling in his life that's
[41:10] right
[41:13] he looked out there
[41:15] he saw the children of israel
[41:19] and all of a sudden something come on
[41:20] his heart
[41:22] he didn't look at him as mob daubers
[41:25] he looked at him as the elect
[41:28] of god
[41:30] my
[41:32] how would you like to change your vision
[41:37] hey man how about if we could just get a
[41:39] whole different look at what's going on
[41:41] around us
[41:43] because he didn't she just
[41:45] there's some trent something transpired
[41:48] in his heart and he said and moses when
[41:51] he had known that god had made a promise
[41:55] that he was going to deliver the
[41:57] children of israel
[41:59] why moses knew that he was called for
[42:02] that purpose
[42:04] now listen to this
[42:06] because
[42:07] this is again bringing it back to you
[42:12] and the
[42:13] responsibility that you have of coming
[42:16] in contact with god
[42:20] now when you have a call from god
[42:23] that doesn't altogether mean that you
[42:25] jump right out
[42:27] and you're doing the will of god you
[42:30] have to find the will of god and the
[42:33] time
[42:34] of god to do it
[42:39] you know that takes something that a lot
[42:41] of us and myself in particular preaching
[42:44] to myself this morning find it hard to
[42:47] do is wait on the lord
[42:53] now listen what he's saying moses saw he
[42:55] had a call
[42:56] he he saw it was he saw that there was
[42:59] the need there was the situation he had
[43:02] to call but
[43:04] it didn't mean that you just jump out
[43:06] and do it
[43:07] that you just jump in there and go about
[43:10] it your own way and
[43:13] and do it there there's there's a time
[43:16] element involved
[43:20] remember god will always equip his man
[43:23] to do the job
[43:26] he'll always do that so so you know
[43:29] moses what did he do he just
[43:32] he just he just jumped out there and he
[43:34] went and got a sword and he was going to
[43:36] do it in himself
[43:38] and he'd do it and it's the same thing
[43:41] that a a a lot of us do
[43:44] he he says
[43:49] he says he says
[43:51] he says that's the reason moses had
[43:53] forgot about
[43:54] freedom god's promise that he would free
[43:58] them
[43:59] but god hadn't forgot his promise
[44:01] moses tried in himself and failed
[44:20] that's what the church has done many
[44:22] times
[44:23] we've tried in ourselves to do things
[44:27] and when we and we fail to find god's
[44:30] element
[44:31] of time
[44:35] now
[44:36] that now that
[44:38] that places you in a position that
[44:41] you're going to have to pray about it
[44:44] you've got a loved one you've got
[44:46] something you've got something that you
[44:48] want you know our tendency is i'm going
[44:51] to make a program and i'm going to get
[44:52] this to work but the scripture says they
[44:55] that wait upon the lord that they shall
[44:58] renew their strength
[45:01] he says many times he says
[45:05] uh
[45:06] he says and that we find ourselves dude
[45:09] and god has
[45:11] a time
[45:13] god has times for seasons
[45:16] he has seasons for his word
[45:18] he has times the scripture here where he
[45:22] said and the presence of the lord was
[45:25] there to heal the sick
[45:28] that's when jesus
[45:31] was ministering too
[45:34] at the presence of the lord was there to
[45:37] heal
[45:38] the sick
[45:39] maybe at other times the presence of the
[45:43] lord wasn't there to heal the sick
[45:50] whoa
[45:53] and we find out that god works
[45:56] everything seasonally
[45:58] and now when moses when he had failed
[46:02] to find
[46:04] what was the time limit of god
[46:08] moses acted before the time
[46:11] but look there's a there's a i mean
[46:14] these are things that we should be able
[46:16] to start understanding
[46:18] that you know we think that there's a
[46:20] time
[46:21] that the presence of the lord comes to
[46:23] heal
[46:25] if not we we're going to try to run and
[46:27] try to heal this person try to heal that
[46:30] person to try to do this to
[46:32] to try to do this we're going to make it
[46:35] come to pass no you're not
[46:38] god's got a season he's got a time
[46:45] he had a time that it was going to rain
[46:48] 40 years later he had a time that aaron
[46:51] abraham was going to bring forth the
[46:53] child
[46:54] you know how many years later
[46:58] you know he's got a time he's got a
[47:00] season he's got a a place that's going
[47:03] to
[47:04] talk about so we're talking about our
[47:06] position
[47:08] and our place in him and and where he
[47:12] put us now he put us in this
[47:15] in
[47:16] in this
[47:18] economy
[47:20] of god is that correct so we know that
[47:24] we know that we're in his economy
[47:27] we know that we're a part of them and
[47:29] god had a time so we had a time for
[47:33] moses
[47:34] but there had to be something that
[47:36] transpired first
[47:41] and let's see how beautiful this
[47:42] statement is because it sums it up for
[47:45] me
[47:46] he says
[47:49] he said
[47:51] then when god revealed himself to him in
[47:54] the burning bush
[47:58] he found out then
[48:01] that the very thing that he
[48:04] that was in the burning bush
[48:06] was the thing that he lacked
[48:14] moses had the call he was trying to jump
[48:17] into it you know we do the same thing we
[48:20] read a scripture
[48:23] you know what i mean and we read that
[48:26] scripture and now we're just going to
[48:27] jump in and take that scripture no god's
[48:30] got a time for things he's got a season
[48:34] for things he's got a way that he does
[48:36] it you know that's why we've got to make
[48:38] a trip to the burning bush because it's
[48:41] in the burning bush is got what it was
[48:45] that moses lacked
[48:47] and
[48:48] and
[48:50] and and i think that's the whole lot
[48:53] with us today
[48:55] that many times we try to do the program
[48:59] ourselves
[49:00] and failed to get what was in the
[49:03] burning bush
[49:08] the direct revelation
[49:10] of the will and time
[49:13] of god
[49:17] now watch how we're operating
[49:20] we get out here and we start operating
[49:23] by our own faith
[49:26] we start operating by our own will
[49:29] we read a scripture and we see the
[49:32] scripture and now we say i believe that
[49:35] scripture now we're going to jump out
[49:37] here
[49:39] and try to bring that scripture to pass
[49:41] we're going to jump out here and try to
[49:43] make that work we're going to jump out
[49:45] here we're going to judge by it and when
[49:48] all that the scripture is saying is
[49:50] that's a promise to us it's an invite to
[49:54] us to make it to the burning bush
[50:02] that we can get a direct revelation from
[50:05] god
[50:06] about the time
[50:11] yeah what did he say about about the
[50:13] will and the time of god
[50:18] oh
[50:20] does that start to sound like our lives
[50:22] are being brought a little bit under
[50:24] subjection
[50:28] nobody wants to be in her subjection
[50:32] this is lady oseah
[50:36] this is i do what i want to do when i
[50:38] want to do it if i read the bible and
[50:40] the scripture says this then i'm just
[50:42] going to take this scripture and i'm
[50:44] going to take it and i'm going to start
[50:45] hewing a hole in my life i'm going to
[50:48] start doing things i'm going to start
[50:51] doing things according to this scripture
[50:53] this scripture has empowered me to do
[50:57] everything but
[50:58] remember god still got a time for that
[51:02] scripture he's got a season for that
[51:04] scripture he's got a will for that
[51:07] scripture he has a spirit that goes
[51:09] along with that scripture there's things
[51:12] that he has got to provide from the
[51:15] burning bush that you can have the
[51:17] revelation a direct revelation and the
[51:20] direct will of god
[51:26] it isn't just i'm going to take this
[51:29] book and i'm going to wield it
[51:32] anyway that i want to we're talking
[51:34] about maturing to a place and i want to
[51:36] move along so i can get to what i want
[51:38] to say
[51:40] this morning just for a moment but
[51:46] he said
[51:49] he says now
[51:51] us full gospel people
[51:54] i think
[51:55] have many
[51:56] mistakes by looking at the word of god
[51:59] and saying
[52:01] god said this
[52:03] and we fail to find the direct
[52:06] revelation of our life
[52:10] to fit in that program
[52:14] when we find that
[52:16] then it's got to happen
[52:18] and i think there's where it
[52:21] has been failed
[52:26] what did he say
[52:28] he says
[52:29] i think this is many mistake by looking
[52:31] at the word and saying god said this
[52:36] god said it
[52:39] but we failed to find the direct
[52:41] revelation
[52:43] and the direct will
[52:47] and revelation to our life
[52:52] to fit into the program
[52:56] you know a lot of times you want to pray
[52:57] for somebody
[52:59] god's a healer
[53:02] you want to do the prayer side
[53:04] well then your side's got to get fixed
[53:07] up
[53:09] many of you that know the message know
[53:11] how many times brother branham had to go
[53:13] get this right he had to go make that
[53:15] right he had to go get this he had to
[53:17] wait and not because there was a time
[53:20] everything had to fall in its order
[53:22] everything that had to fall in its place
[53:25] now
[53:26] what i'm trying to say is i want you to
[53:27] understand i don't care if whether
[53:28] you're in high school i don't care if
[53:30] you're eight years old my goodness
[53:33] they're teaching stuff nowadays
[53:34] technology and everything why can't we
[53:36] teach the gospel
[53:41] you know why do we always think that
[53:42] everybody's ignorant young kids can get
[53:45] the holy ghost
[53:48] god can deal with yet three o'clock in
[53:50] the morning beginning
[53:52] sure he can
[53:56] but to find out where it fits in our
[53:59] life
[54:01] so i want to take a good look at
[54:03] ourselves
[54:05] there's a whole aspect of the word of
[54:08] god
[54:09] that that
[54:10] gets left out
[54:12] i mean i'm just preaching this morning
[54:14] because it's my responsibility to preach
[54:16] for to you the truth
[54:20] and i know when i when i
[54:23] went through this i didn't want to
[54:24] preach it
[54:26] because
[54:27] normally
[54:29] i
[54:29] find myself to be the most guilty
[54:32] the chiefest of all sinners
[54:36] but there's a whole part of our
[54:38] responsibility a whole part of our
[54:40] christian life a whole part of things we
[54:42] go around talking about the word but
[54:45] that word still's got a personal place
[54:47] in our life a revelation
[54:51] of the will and the time of it and that
[54:55] something that you've got to to seek and
[54:58] and i'll get to this in a moment but if
[55:00] you're not doing that you will find
[55:02] yourself in a condition
[55:06] and because that's what we do so
[55:10] and so and and then if not then we end
[55:13] up comparing ourselves one to another
[55:17] we end up looking around comparing
[55:19] ourselves to this person comparing
[55:21] ourselves to that
[55:24] you know we end up comparing
[55:26] impersonating and copying
[55:32] and god's not interested in the group
[55:36] it's not a group revelation it's not a
[55:38] group action
[55:40] god will have things for you to do that
[55:42] are you alone and you've got to have the
[55:45] courage
[55:48] and the faith
[55:49] to stand on that
[55:51] exactly what god's dealing with your
[55:53] heart especially those of you that are
[55:56] under peer pressure
[56:00] you know one girl starts gabbing or
[56:02] talking i remember we had a lot of this
[56:04] little click stuff
[56:06] going on you know this idea well girls
[56:09] this age hang together i understand
[56:11] girls certain age hands together but
[56:13] that don't mean you're mean to the
[56:14] younger ones
[56:19] you're kind
[56:21] you're gentle you're good
[56:23] you give them a moment of time they
[56:25] don't understand all the parts of your
[56:27] life
[56:29] where you are what you're going through
[56:31] the things that you deal with sure
[56:33] they're younger but they look up to you
[56:35] they had admiration for you they they
[56:38] they care for you they respect you
[56:40] you've got you can't be a snob
[56:45] i know what god does with snobs he gets
[56:47] them out
[56:51] they'll poison you
[56:54] love everyone
[56:58] no need to have clicks
[57:00] go out of your way foot washing don't
[57:02] wash feet with the same person you
[57:04] already know you got dirty feet go find
[57:07] somebody else's foot you've never washed
[57:09] before
[57:12] you know
[57:13] broaden your horizons be gentle be kind
[57:16] be good and don't prove nothing to run
[57:19] somebody else down
[57:22] amen
[57:23] you know what i mean so teacher you know
[57:26] teach it's good we're not mean to nobody
[57:30] you know and i don't expect you to sit
[57:32] down and play
[57:34] blocks you know
[57:36] with somebody all the time but
[57:38] yeah i've seen kids sit down they play
[57:41] blocks with a kid that's playing blocks
[57:43] it's not your whole life but you give
[57:45] them a season you give them a time
[57:47] you're kind you're gentle they don't
[57:49] hurt you none
[57:51] you know don't don't be like that
[57:54] understand the individualness of it
[57:56] and let me just move right along here
[58:00] he says so
[58:02] he said so we can't come here so there
[58:05] you are
[58:06] so we can't do that we have got to do
[58:09] what god revealed to us to do
[58:14] amen
[58:15] billy graham is going to do that god has
[58:18] revealed to him
[58:21] a worldwide revival he's making good
[58:24] a show of it too i appreciate that i'm
[58:27] trying to do my best by the revelation
[58:30] that god has given me to minister to the
[58:32] sick people what god told me to do
[58:36] so it's important that we find
[58:40] our position
[58:42] and know
[58:43] that it's god's word that has promised
[58:47] it
[58:49] no where has he placed you this morning
[58:51] just for a few moments
[58:53] where has he placed you in him
[58:58] you understand
[59:00] what what did he do
[59:03] where did he place you first of all he
[59:06] purchased you
[59:08] with his blood
[59:10] that's what he did you were vile you
[59:13] were lost
[59:15] you you were there but you were in him
[59:18] before the foundation of the world he
[59:20] had chosen you
[59:23] and so you you had a place in him
[59:26] you you had a position in him it's where
[59:29] you were
[59:30] in him and
[59:32] and so
[59:34] what what was he going to do with that
[59:36] uh
[59:37] position so the first thing he did was
[59:40] is where has he placed you in himself
[59:46] look he he
[59:47] he he placed you in heavenly places
[59:52] let's just read again in ephesians
[59:55] paul an apostle of jesus christ
[59:58] by the will of god to the saints which
[1:00:01] are at ephesus
[1:00:03] to the faithful in christ jesus grace be
[1:00:06] induced now who's this too
[1:00:09] it isn't to the unbeliever
[1:00:12] it's to the saints
[1:00:15] it's to the elect
[1:00:17] it's to the chosen it's to them that are
[1:00:20] in christ now you know this morning
[1:00:23] whether you're in christ or not
[1:00:28] if you're outside get in
[1:00:31] get out of the world get in
[1:00:35] get under the blood get under the
[1:00:37] holiness
[1:00:39] don't dress like these women out here in
[1:00:41] the world don't run around half naked
[1:00:44] don't don't strip down in this modern
[1:00:47] ladies striptease you might think you're
[1:00:50] only you're only committing adultery
[1:00:52] with every lustful spirit around
[1:00:58] you don't want to be a part of that
[1:01:00] which the end thereof is to burn
[1:01:06] that's not where he put you
[1:01:10] put you in him
[1:01:13] he placed you in him so this is the
[1:01:16] believers
[1:01:17] grace and peace from god the father
[1:01:20] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:01:22] lord jesus christ who have blessed us
[1:01:26] with all spiritual blessings
[1:01:29] in heavenly places
[1:01:33] so he didn't put you
[1:01:35] in the world
[1:01:39] he puts you in heavenly places
[1:01:42] what do you think all this music is i
[1:01:44] know music's a tough one
[1:01:48] because it attaches to your senses
[1:01:52] it attaches to your emotion
[1:01:54] it's a very physical
[1:01:56] carnal thing
[1:01:58] the old riff of the guitar you know
[1:02:03] just a demon
[1:02:07] you know what i mean
[1:02:09] or you go down the street and someone's
[1:02:11] over there
[1:02:16] you know what i mean and
[1:02:18] you leave the stop sign and they take
[1:02:20] off and you're sitting there
[1:02:24] why it's spirits
[1:02:26] it's the world
[1:02:28] he didn't position us there he didn't
[1:02:30] place us there he didn't place us in the
[1:02:33] world he took us out of the world and he
[1:02:37] put us in another dimension another
[1:02:40] realm heavenly places
[1:02:44] that's where he has us this morning you
[1:02:46] can be there
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:49] you can be in heavenly places
[1:02:55] i heard a statement
[1:02:58] a while ago
[1:03:00] that a lady was
[1:03:03] talking and they were two talking
[1:03:05] and uh
[1:03:07] she was talking about how long it took
[1:03:09] her to put on her makeup
[1:03:12] i thought man that's gotta be about two
[1:03:14] minute deal
[1:03:16] no
[1:03:17] she's got
[1:03:20] cover-up and
[1:03:22] foundation and
[1:03:25] epoxy and putty
[1:03:27] and drywall
[1:03:29] after you know and paint
[1:03:32] i mean it's like it's like a 45 minute
[1:03:35] deal
[1:03:38] you know and then she got these little
[1:03:44] you know what i'm saying
[1:03:46] what what is she trying out for the
[1:03:48] wicked witch of the north
[1:03:52] you know where's that at
[1:03:53] who deceived a woman in the thinking by
[1:03:57] putting all this junk on her face that
[1:04:00] makes her look like an old woman in a
[1:04:02] few years is is is pretty
[1:04:07] that's carnal
[1:04:09] that's deception
[1:04:11] that's looking in the mirror painting a
[1:04:14] different picture of yourself in the
[1:04:16] mirror and then telling yourself that's
[1:04:18] what you look like well don't ever take
[1:04:20] a shower
[1:04:23] because you're going to end up with the
[1:04:25] really person that god made you which is
[1:04:28] a whole lot better looking than any max
[1:04:31] factor deal
[1:04:34] it's the truth
[1:04:37] don't be deceived into that don't be
[1:04:39] deceived in all this eyelid shadow
[1:04:43] stuff up there
[1:04:46] somebody ought to preach against it
[1:04:48] because they sure don't look good to a
[1:04:50] son of god
[1:04:55] you know what i mean we don't need that
[1:04:57] stuff we're not sitting there
[1:05:00] we're not sitting there we don't care
[1:05:03] what the world looks like we don't
[1:05:06] care oh i got my own few little soap
[1:05:09] boxes i'd get on about apartment stores
[1:05:13] they ought to put all the private stuff
[1:05:15] in the middle of the store instead of
[1:05:17] all the private stuff at the door when
[1:05:19] you come in
[1:05:20] shows you where the world's at
[1:05:23] don't get caught up in the world
[1:05:29] the wages of sin is death the wages of
[1:05:32] unbelief is death you see all those
[1:05:35] counters and those ladies sitting there
[1:05:37] in this and they're sitting there pain
[1:05:39] that's death
[1:05:40] the death that's the death angel come
[1:05:43] here let me paint death on you
[1:05:46] that's right
[1:05:47] i'm gonna put the mark of death on you
[1:05:50] i'm going to give you the spirit of
[1:05:52] jezebel
[1:05:56] that's what it is it's the truth it's
[1:05:58] the gospel i can't change this god's got
[1:06:00] something else for his church it's
[1:06:02] called the holy spirit
[1:06:04] he's got something else for him it's
[1:06:06] called his life his spirit he's got
[1:06:09] something else it's not max factor it's
[1:06:12] not makeup it's not tight clothes and
[1:06:14] and sisters and a lot of you sisters
[1:06:17] that that that come you're my children i
[1:06:19] if i have improved my love for you
[1:06:22] despite your color your country your
[1:06:24] rates your creed but let me tell you
[1:06:26] something sometimes our african sisters
[1:06:28] wear their dresses way
[1:06:31] too tight
[1:06:35] sure it's culture
[1:06:40] i don't know where that gets beautiful
[1:06:43] we don't measure beauty by the outside
[1:06:46] we measure beauty by the spirit we
[1:06:48] measure beauty by the soul
[1:06:53] we don't have to dress like that
[1:06:56] we don't have to have tight tops on
[1:07:04] a scissors should never
[1:07:06] excuse the expression i i don't know any
[1:07:08] other word for it but i think they call
[1:07:10] it cleavage you should never show none
[1:07:13] of that
[1:07:15] just to be honest issue we used to feel
[1:07:18] that the collar bone should be from from
[1:07:20] there up could just cover it from the
[1:07:22] collar bone up
[1:07:23] you'll be safe i don't have no law for
[1:07:25] that i don't know i have no rule for
[1:07:27] that but i've looked at the godly women
[1:07:30] that i've known over the time that the
[1:07:31] scripture told me that they were
[1:07:33] examples
[1:07:36] your dress should always cover your
[1:07:38] knees standing in or sitting
[1:07:43] if you've got to do a 10-minute shift
[1:07:45] adjustment
[1:07:46] to sit down you need a shift in the soul
[1:07:49] first
[1:07:52] that's right
[1:07:53] i'm talking well i'll just tell you what
[1:07:56] i was going to preach about
[1:07:57] so you can just get to where i'm going
[1:07:59] i'm talking going to preach this morning
[1:08:01] about the church being lukewarm
[1:08:09] just think of it we don't we're not
[1:08:12] sitting there
[1:08:14] that's not where he's placed us
[1:08:16] he's placed us in heavenly places
[1:08:20] in christ jesus
[1:08:23] that's where he's pointless that's where
[1:08:24] he's positioned us another
[1:08:26] so that's where he plays with he says he
[1:08:29] where did he place us in himself
[1:08:32] he placed us in heavenly places in him
[1:08:37] that we can be full participants
[1:08:41] of all the benefits and blessings that
[1:08:44] he has
[1:08:48] how did he do it
[1:08:52] he did it by the blood
[1:08:57] he did it by going to calvary
[1:09:01] suffering a cruel death
[1:09:04] of humiliation
[1:09:06] scourging
[1:09:08] being nailed
[1:09:10] uh to a cross
[1:09:13] being speared in the sight hanging there
[1:09:17] and
[1:09:18] and
[1:09:18] and giving up his spirit
[1:09:21] that's how he got you here
[1:09:24] by by the blood there's no place we have
[1:09:28] no place to worship him outside the
[1:09:30] blood he he paid for you he died for you
[1:09:37] and then you can take that same price he
[1:09:40] paid for you and that's what he paid for
[1:09:42] your children
[1:09:46] your loved ones
[1:09:49] you're sitting in heavenly places
[1:09:52] in him and
[1:09:55] in the any so
[1:09:57] how did you get there that's how he did
[1:09:59] it
[1:10:02] they paid for it
[1:10:05] he suffered
[1:10:08] for you
[1:10:10] not to be part of the world
[1:10:14] yeah you might have to bear a little
[1:10:15] reproach
[1:10:18] you think the reproach of this present
[1:10:20] world is worthy to compare with the joy
[1:10:24] and the glory that we're going to have
[1:10:26] in him
[1:10:31] just think about it
[1:10:34] we're getting to the place we're just
[1:10:36] cruising along
[1:10:38] we're living every day i don't even know
[1:10:40] if i'll even get to my sermon i don't
[1:10:42] know how long i've been i've been way
[1:10:43] too long i should quit
[1:10:46] i think it's 11 30 right
[1:10:49] well what what's nine minutes
[1:10:57] like we got like it's just going to
[1:10:59] happen
[1:11:05] so
[1:11:06] and why did he do it let's just finish
[1:11:09] reading this
[1:11:11] he says according to he hath chosen us
[1:11:13] in him
[1:11:14] before the foundation of the world that
[1:11:17] we should be holy and without blame
[1:11:20] before him in love
[1:11:26] we need to get the scrub brushes out in
[1:11:28] our lives
[1:11:31] young people i know it's hard
[1:11:34] but these video games
[1:11:37] they're they're time consumers
[1:11:40] they eat you up
[1:11:42] what have you accomplished
[1:11:46] after an hour and a half of playing
[1:11:49] combat

[1:12:20] really really
[1:12:24] i hear girls play
[1:12:26] video games now too
[1:12:29] i can't imagine can you imagine a man
[1:12:31] and wife sitting in bed boom boom boom
[1:12:33] boom
[1:12:34] boom
[1:12:40] kill the other guy
[1:12:44] no this is going on
[1:12:47] this is going on this is accepted
[1:12:50] behavior
[1:12:54] it's poison
[1:12:56] flowing through the veins of the church
[1:12:59] keeping the church from climbing
[1:13:02] to the places that they belong
[1:13:06] we're out of position that's not where
[1:13:08] he positioned
[1:13:10] you say how am i going to give up this
[1:13:12] video game praise god that's why he gave
[1:13:15] us his spirit we can do all things
[1:13:18] through christ jesus who strengthen us
[1:13:21] he's got a spirit to do that he's got
[1:13:24] the power to do that he's got a grace to
[1:13:28] do that he can deliver you from
[1:13:30] pornography he can deliver you from
[1:13:32] music he can deliver you from games he
[1:13:35] can deliver you from fashion
[1:13:40] he wants to positionally place us in
[1:13:44] himself
[1:13:49] it's hard
[1:13:51] i'm not saying it's not hard
[1:13:54] but this isn't for
[1:13:57] this isn't for weaklings
[1:14:00] christianity is rugged
[1:14:05] it's real
[1:14:09] it can and you've got to come to the
[1:14:12] place that you've got to understand what
[1:14:15] the price he paid for you
[1:14:17] and what he's offering you and where he
[1:14:20] wants to place you in him
[1:14:22] why he did it
[1:14:24] and how he did it
[1:14:27] he did it with his own life
[1:14:32] he's he's here to stand with you a
[1:14:34] hundred percent
[1:14:36] why did he do it because he wants to
[1:14:38] have fellowship with you he don't want
[1:14:40] you to burn with the rest of the world
[1:14:46] he don't want you to live short
[1:14:48] he don't want you to suffer he don't
[1:14:51] want you to be bound with mental
[1:14:53] heart aches and mental headaches and
[1:14:55] mental trials and and fears and doubts
[1:14:59] it's not the kind of god he is why do we
[1:15:02] accept this garbage from this devil that
[1:15:05] brings all this trash
[1:15:12] each of you've got a responsibility to
[1:15:14] get the trash out of your life for the
[1:15:17] rest of the brothers and sisters that
[1:15:19] are sitting around you
[1:15:23] me too
[1:15:28] how long
[1:15:31] are we going to stay
[1:15:33] below
[1:15:34] the position that he placed us in
[1:15:39] he placed us to be sons and daughters
[1:15:42] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:15:45] that goes for i don't care how young you
[1:15:48] are if you can hear me say it it goes
[1:15:50] for you
[1:15:53] i've had many a young little child come
[1:15:56] up to me and ask me to pray for their
[1:15:58] mother or their father and see god
[1:16:00] answer their prayer
[1:16:07] god's for us
[1:16:09] he's not against us
[1:16:13] but we're just getting lukewarm
[1:16:18] that's the curse of our age
[1:16:21] the first thing he says in revelations
[1:16:24] because that's what he cries out and
[1:16:26] that's what he he speaks against him he
[1:16:29] said unto the angel the church of ladies
[1:16:31] write these things saith thee amen the
[1:16:33] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:16:36] of the creation of god i know thy works
[1:16:42] i know what you're doing
[1:16:46] your life is not invisible to me
[1:16:49] i know what you're thinking i know what
[1:16:51] you're doing i i see you're you're laid
[1:16:54] right before me
[1:17:00] i know thy words thou thou are neither
[1:17:03] cold nor hot
[1:17:08] you just lukewarm we're all
[1:17:10] see i'm not condemning us i'm saying if
[1:17:13] this fight this morning
[1:17:15] this is what we've got to fight
[1:17:19] we've got to fight off the lukewarm
[1:17:22] spirit
[1:17:26] we've got to fight it off
[1:17:31] we've got to know he's got a will for
[1:17:33] our lives
[1:17:34] that we're foreordained unto good works
[1:17:38] in christ jesus that we should walk in
[1:17:40] we need to seek those works look at what
[1:17:43] god's will is in our life we just can't
[1:17:46] live our life day by day going on and
[1:17:49] leaving god on the sideline thinking
[1:17:52] that well i believe
[1:17:55] show me your faith without your works
[1:17:59] and i'll show you my faith by my works
[1:18:03] what does he say i would that that were
[1:18:06] neither cold nor hot i would that thou
[1:18:08] were cold or hot
[1:18:10] so because
[1:18:12] thou art lukewarm
[1:18:17] and neither cold nor hot
[1:18:19] i will spill thee
[1:18:21] out of my mouth
[1:18:24] what do you think the whole
[1:18:26] enemy wants to do to us
[1:18:29] is make us lukewarm
[1:18:32] let us pat one another on the back
[1:18:35] let us tell us we're the elected we're
[1:18:37] the bride we're the chosen lady we're
[1:18:40] the greatest ones we're the we're so
[1:18:42] good in other words really we don't need
[1:18:45] the blood anymore
[1:18:48] you know what i mean that that's already
[1:18:51] been paid
[1:18:53] no
[1:18:55] he'd been paying it for you for a long
[1:18:57] time
[1:18:59] he was paying it for you the first
[1:19:01] cookie you stole
[1:19:04] everything sin you've done along the way
[1:19:07] he's been there paying for it
[1:19:10] isn't it about time that
[1:19:12] we stop
[1:19:16] and fall back in love with our first
[1:19:19] love
[1:19:20] the prophet of god said he said you
[1:19:22] don't understand it he said because you
[1:19:25] haven't laid your hands on his head
[1:19:30] and felt the suffering
[1:19:32] that he suffered
[1:19:34] to pay for your sins
[1:19:40] that would sure change our attitude
[1:19:44] do you understand he's become
[1:19:46] a secondhand robe
[1:19:51] he's become a wallflower
[1:19:53] he's become jesus with dirty feet
[1:19:57] he he's he
[1:19:59] he our careers
[1:20:01] our jobs our social life there's so much
[1:20:04] stuff
[1:20:05] that's that's out in front of them
[1:20:07] anymore
[1:20:11] that that we've almost forgot i'm
[1:20:14] talking to myself that i've almost
[1:20:16] forgot that there's that god has
[1:20:19] he he wants to lead me
[1:20:22] and guide me
[1:20:24] into all truth and righteousness that
[1:20:26] that he's got a plan for my life things
[1:20:29] that he wants me to do that i should be
[1:20:31] seeking
[1:20:33] his face seeking his will what would you
[1:20:36] have me to do okay if if i if if this
[1:20:40] scripture be true
[1:20:42] and i believe it's true he says for we
[1:20:44] are his workmanship
[1:20:46] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:20:50] which god hath before foreordained that
[1:20:53] we should walk in them do you understand
[1:20:55] if you're not seeking
[1:21:02] what those works are
[1:21:06] i guess they didn't put it up
[1:21:09] go ahead and put that up ephesians
[1:21:12] 2
[1:21:13] and 10.
[1:21:16] if you can find that just look at that
[1:21:19] you're his workmanship
[1:21:24] i'm ashamed of that
[1:21:30] if i really want to look in the mirror
[1:21:33] and say okay
[1:21:35] this is what he's done
[1:21:40] he positioned
[1:21:42] myself in him
[1:21:45] but he didn't position me where i
[1:21:47] wouldn't seek the revelation of his will
[1:21:52] where i wouldn't get go to the burning
[1:21:54] bush
[1:21:55] and get what it is that i have need
[1:21:58] to make the scriptures come to pass in
[1:22:01] my life it's a relationship
[1:22:04] church it's going to the bush it's going
[1:22:07] the spirit it's having that spirit move
[1:22:09] in and out of us cleansing us leading us
[1:22:12] it's getting into his presence
[1:22:16] because it's going to be his presence i
[1:22:18] can do all things through christ jesus
[1:22:20] who strengthens me you can't live day in
[1:22:24] and day out having a mental faith of
[1:22:27] this message and never get into his
[1:22:29] presence
[1:22:31] never come unto his holy spirit
[1:22:34] never get there and let the let the
[1:22:36] world pass away from you and just be
[1:22:39] caught up in worship and praise and let
[1:22:42] them give the timing of his word in your
[1:22:44] heart
[1:22:48] we can't go on day by day just letting
[1:22:51] the days drag on
[1:22:56] we've got to get back engaged
[1:23:00] i'll close
[1:23:07] he's done all those
[1:23:09] things
[1:23:11] for us he's placed this in himself
[1:23:14] he he and and he makes this great
[1:23:18] statement
[1:23:20] he says now for a moment if we could
[1:23:23] find our positionally
[1:23:25] what we are
[1:23:27] in christ
[1:23:29] what are you in him
[1:23:33] let's just finish reading our scripture
[1:23:37] hath predestinated us
[1:23:39] unto adoption
[1:23:41] of the children by jesus christ to
[1:23:44] himself
[1:23:45] according to his good pleasure you know
[1:23:47] what adopted means
[1:23:49] it means he's giving you everything
[1:23:53] that he was
[1:23:56] he's made you equal
[1:23:58] to him
[1:24:01] we know the whole story of adoption
[1:24:03] right the father would teach his
[1:24:04] children by tutor when the boy learned
[1:24:07] all the trade and all the business and
[1:24:10] everything the tutor would bring him to
[1:24:11] the father and the tutor would say your
[1:24:14] son now he's always a son
[1:24:18] but he say now your son is ready
[1:24:21] to take over
[1:24:23] the business
[1:24:26] your son's ready to do what you do
[1:24:29] and then the father would say son you go
[1:24:31] take this field you go take these cattle
[1:24:34] you go do this it's yours you do it you
[1:24:36] run it it's yours
[1:24:39] you're a part of me
[1:24:42] and that's what that's what he's
[1:24:44] that's why he's placed us in him
[1:24:47] so everything that he was we could be
[1:24:53] men to the men the things that men do
[1:24:56] women to women the things that women do
[1:24:58] the ministry our sisters have the
[1:25:01] ministry our brothers have the ministry
[1:25:03] our teenagers the young people have the
[1:25:06] ministry that our sunday school children
[1:25:08] have it's all him he wants to place
[1:25:11] himself he wants to adopt us in others
[1:25:14] he wants to transfer his authority to us
[1:25:21] that's what adoption meant the transfer
[1:25:23] of authority
[1:25:26] all of you that are sitting here
[1:25:29] he wants you to give you the same
[1:25:32] authority that he had
[1:25:34] all he's asking in return is some form
[1:25:38] of
[1:25:38] dedication
[1:25:40] some form of sanctification
[1:25:42] some form of acknowledgement some form
[1:25:45] of sitting in counseling
[1:25:48] and seeking his will his revelation and
[1:25:51] his timing
[1:25:56] otherwise we're like any other
[1:25:58] denomination
[1:26:06] he's he
[1:26:07] he's got something for each of us
[1:26:14] if we could just
[1:26:16] find that beautiful place
[1:26:19] by faith
[1:26:26] now that he who's addressed it to
[1:26:30] believers positioned in christ
[1:26:32] and christ will only meet the believer
[1:26:35] the believer can only worship christ as
[1:26:38] he's positionally placed
[1:26:41] in
[1:26:42] christ
[1:26:44] and then i'd like just to close
[1:26:48] with this
[1:26:50] statement so you can
[1:26:54] understand now
[1:26:55] i am closing
[1:26:59] now
[1:27:01] into his church
[1:27:04] you that's
[1:27:05] positionally
[1:27:07] is setting in heavenly places in christ
[1:27:10] jesus
[1:27:12] be humble
[1:27:14] brethren
[1:27:15] someday the holy spirit will speak to
[1:27:18] you
[1:27:20] call you out to one side somewhere
[1:27:24] in a little cabin or on a hillside
[1:27:27] or in the washroom somewhere
[1:27:30] and there will anoint you
[1:27:33] for a certain service
[1:27:35] or a certain thing
[1:27:37] to do
[1:27:43] believers
[1:27:45] positioned in christ
[1:27:47] one day he's going to call you aside
[1:27:50] in a maybe in a car maybe in a washroom
[1:27:55] and he's going to give you
[1:27:57] something certain to do
[1:28:00] it won't be
[1:28:02] it won't be the laying on of the hands
[1:28:05] of the presbyters or elders
[1:28:08] it'll be the laying on of hands of god
[1:28:11] almighty
[1:28:13] to put a new ministry in you
[1:28:16] a new robe on you
[1:28:19] and to get you out
[1:28:22] as an example
[1:28:26] and all the demons out of torment
[1:28:30] will never
[1:28:31] upset you
[1:28:32] god granted my brethren
[1:28:35] that each will receive this blessing
[1:28:40] just think of that it's so wonderful
[1:28:46] and
[1:28:52] so we have a place in christ this
[1:28:54] morning
[1:28:57] and we all know
[1:28:59] let's let's face the facts
[1:29:02] where we're sitting
[1:29:04] we're sitting in the most evil
[1:29:07] time
[1:29:08] that has ever been on the earth
[1:29:12] men with women
[1:29:14] women with women
[1:29:16] men becoming women women becoming men
[1:29:20] we're teaching our children not even to
[1:29:22] be a boy or a girl
[1:29:24] when god said
[1:29:27] that he made them male and female
[1:29:31] when god commissioned them to go forth
[1:29:33] and multiply
[1:29:36] where a woman's saved in
[1:29:39] in in in
[1:29:41] child bearing and and and so much of the
[1:29:45] scripture
[1:29:46] teaches us but the bible tells us that
[1:29:50] the time would come when god would sneer
[1:29:53] sheer their conscience
[1:29:56] with a hot iron
[1:29:58] and they would no longer want to retain
[1:30:01] god in their knowledge
[1:30:05] think of it
[1:30:08] because
[1:30:10] that's the way it was in old times
[1:30:13] the same way it is now
[1:30:16] the wickedness of our age
[1:30:19] i mean i don't even see
[1:30:22] how the cup
[1:30:24] of iniquity is not
[1:30:26] filled yet
[1:30:31] there's no there's no
[1:30:33] telling i mean look what they've just
[1:30:36] done that for years they shut down our
[1:30:38] businesses they put masks on our face we
[1:30:41] all fell into obedience to the
[1:30:43] government under some sort of fear and
[1:30:46] now they come right back and they say oh
[1:30:48] we're sorry the vaccines don't work
[1:30:57] does not that shake you
[1:31:01] to let you realize how unstable
[1:31:04] we are
[1:31:06] how unstable the leadership is
[1:31:09] how insane the thinking of man is
[1:31:16] but you'll understand we become numb
[1:31:23] the prophet of god called it amnesia
[1:31:30] but i want you to notice this
[1:31:32] even in the scripture before
[1:31:35] the wickeder the hour gets
[1:31:39] the more easily
[1:31:41] amnesia sets in
[1:31:47] the worse it gets
[1:31:50] the easier it is to forget
[1:31:53] what a high standard we live by
[1:32:01] now understand that
[1:32:03] the atmosphere the recognizing the day
[1:32:06] in your message
[1:32:07] recognizing everything that's going on
[1:32:10] the worse it gets out there
[1:32:14] the uglier it gets the more ungodly it
[1:32:18] gets burning down our cities burning
[1:32:20] down our courtrooms hundreds and
[1:32:23] hundreds and hundreds of good american
[1:32:25] citizens
[1:32:26] sleeping on the street
[1:32:30] the worse it gets
[1:32:34] the easier it is for you to forget
[1:32:44] it's hard
[1:32:47] to fight
[1:32:50] it's hard to stand up
[1:32:52] it's hard to shake yourself
[1:32:55] it's hard to seek the will of the lord
[1:32:58] it's hard to get into the spirit
[1:33:01] it's hard to crawl call out unto the
[1:33:03] spirit it's hard to get in front of the
[1:33:07] burning bush and say what
[1:33:09] do i
[1:33:11] lack
[1:33:16] because this is lady osea
[1:33:19] proud
[1:33:21] blind miserable naked and don't know it
[1:33:25] thinking that they what
[1:33:27] have need of nothing
[1:33:30] the worse it gets the easier it is for
[1:33:32] you to think you're okay
[1:33:37] we can't get sucked in church
[1:33:42] we can't get lukewarm
[1:33:46] i'm crying out to you this morning
[1:33:49] i know
[1:33:50] that it's it's hard right now we're
[1:33:52] suffering with parking but it's hard to
[1:33:54] come out the church
[1:33:56] it's hard to sit in your car but don't
[1:33:58] get
[1:34:02] lukewarm don't fall off now
[1:34:06] don't let up now don't think you're okay
[1:34:09] now
[1:34:10] find your way into his presence
[1:34:16] let him deal with your heart
[1:34:19] say what you have need of don't drift
[1:34:21] away
[1:34:24] and not closing with this statement
[1:34:28] because he made us to be a certain way
[1:34:32] and if we're not living the way he made
[1:34:35] us then we're living below our privilege
[1:34:39] and if we're living below our privilege
[1:34:41] then we're lukewarm
[1:34:45] and lukewarm
[1:34:46] is the danger
[1:34:49] of our age
[1:34:52] listen what he says this is in spiritual
[1:34:55] amnesia page 7 paragraph 50.
[1:35:00] so has god's people
[1:35:04] in these last days
[1:35:06] has forgotten
[1:35:09] what the testimony
[1:35:11] of being a christian means
[1:35:20] they forgot
[1:35:22] what the test ask yourself
[1:35:27] do you have a definition
[1:35:31] for your own life what it means to be a
[1:35:33] christian
[1:35:36] i got a lot of them
[1:35:38] it means that i'm not going to race that
[1:35:40] guy that's trying to get in front of me
[1:35:46] you know it means that i'm not gonna
[1:35:49] honk my horn
[1:35:50] at the person that sits there for two
[1:35:53] and a half
[1:35:54] milliseconds to respond to the light
[1:36:00] the world don't have to run at the pace
[1:36:02] that i run
[1:36:04] maybe god's trying to slow me down
[1:36:07] and i think the world needs to speed up
[1:36:10] maybe i need a trip to the bush
[1:36:14] to find out what does it lack lord what
[1:36:16] do i lack
[1:36:17] to have the love of god shed abroad in
[1:36:19] my heart what do i lack to have patience
[1:36:22] what do i lack to have long suffering
[1:36:25] what do i lack to have temperance
[1:36:31] i've got to the place that i think i'm
[1:36:32] going to cover it all with the
[1:36:34] revelation of the seven seals and the
[1:36:37] mysteries and the book of life and the
[1:36:39] lamb's book of life and predestination
[1:36:42] and and all the mysteries and all those
[1:36:44] if i you know all the mysteries and i
[1:36:46] have not charity i am nothing
[1:36:52] where where have we got to think that
[1:36:54] because we believe the message we don't
[1:36:56] have to be christians
[1:37:02] i got a a a good baptist lumber salesman
[1:37:07] i want to talk about lumber he wants to
[1:37:09] talk about jesus
[1:37:11] he never met nobody wants to talk like
[1:37:13] about jesus like i do
[1:37:15] he's just preaching away to me i says
[1:37:17] how much is two by fours oh you know
[1:37:19] when it amazing that nowadays god's just
[1:37:22] trying to do these things yeah brother
[1:37:23] thank god
[1:37:27] i thought i finally said praise god
[1:37:30] they're free
[1:37:33] they might be
[1:37:36] i don't know
[1:37:38] because you get out of contact with them
[1:37:41] you get out of fellowship with them
[1:37:44] you're lukewarm and you don't know it
[1:37:50] we don't even know what it's like to be
[1:37:51] close to the fire
[1:37:53] to be burned up on the inside
[1:37:56] lord let's get us back
[1:37:59] he says what it means
[1:38:01] it's again this amnesia
[1:38:04] has become upon the people now this is
[1:38:07] the definition of lukewarm to me
[1:38:10] they can't
[1:38:12] identify
[1:38:14] themselves
[1:38:20] can you identify yourself in christ this
[1:38:23] morning
[1:38:26] don't condemn yourself
[1:38:28] if you don't
[1:38:31] if you don't lift your hand
[1:38:34] and say father
[1:38:36] give me an identification
[1:38:39] moses went 40 years
[1:38:43] moses
[1:38:44] failed
[1:38:46] and tried
[1:38:49] but one day he met you
[1:38:52] and he found out that the bush had what
[1:38:54] he was lacking
[1:38:56] and i i i see my i can't identify
[1:39:02] myself
[1:39:06] i really don't know where i'm going i
[1:39:08] don't know what i'm doing i don't know
[1:39:10] what you'd want me to do i believe we're
[1:39:13] not talking about belief
[1:39:16] we're talking about rising above
[1:39:19] being stale
[1:39:21] and stepping into a greater move
[1:39:25] of the spirit of god
[1:39:30] we're not comparing ourselves with the
[1:39:32] rest of the message
[1:39:34] we want to be what the prophet of god
[1:39:36] said our church should
[1:39:38] be by the example he gave
[1:39:46] that our spirits would be right
[1:39:49] our love would be right our care would
[1:39:51] be right or nature would be right
[1:39:53] our fellowship with him would be right
[1:39:57] but he's got a time and a place
[1:39:59] in our day
[1:40:11] they forgot all about it
[1:40:14] they had forgotten his holiness
[1:40:18] they had forgotten his law
[1:40:20] the women were living like the rest of
[1:40:23] the women
[1:40:25] god's church and his people
[1:40:28] has always been
[1:40:32] a separated people
[1:40:35] a called out people
[1:40:38] a peculiar people
[1:40:40] a holy nation a royal priesthood
[1:40:44] offering spiritual sacrifices to god the
[1:40:47] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[1:40:50] his name
[1:40:51] god called this church
[1:40:53] and separated
[1:40:57] it from the world for that
[1:41:00] very purpose
[1:41:03] there's our identification
[1:41:09] a called out people a peculiar people a
[1:41:13] holy nation a royal priesthood offering
[1:41:17] spiritual sacrifice to god the fruits of
[1:41:21] our lips giving praise to his name
[1:41:26] hallelujah
[1:41:29] our identification our life we're not
[1:41:32] lukewarm
[1:41:33] we're on fire he gave us the law
[1:41:37] he must be holy he said i am holy you
[1:41:41] must be holy and without holiness no man
[1:41:45] shall see the lord
[1:41:49] i just try to take you on a path this
[1:41:51] morning
[1:41:52] to present to you that you have a
[1:41:54] responsibility
[1:41:58] to your life in christ
[1:42:02] you have a responsibility to not let the
[1:42:04] lukewarmness of this world
[1:42:08] and again in closing the worse it gets
[1:42:12] the harder it is
[1:42:15] the easier it is to become lukewarm
[1:42:19] because we compare ourselves
[1:42:22] with the rest
[1:42:24] of the world
[1:42:26] we're going to have a baptism
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] this morning
[1:42:31] and
[1:42:33] i don't want to go too much into the
[1:42:35] testimony i don't know
[1:42:37] but miles is going to be baptized this
[1:42:40] morning
[1:42:42] and all i know is is that
[1:42:45] i got a phone call which
[1:42:47] i don't know what time you called matt
[1:42:49] but it felt early
[1:42:52] but i guess
[1:42:54] miles woke him up at three o'clock in
[1:42:56] the morning
[1:43:02] i've had a lot of calls at three o'clock
[1:43:04] in the morning
[1:43:08] most of mine weren't always
[1:43:11] that pleasant
[1:43:15] your son's down here at the
[1:43:18] place
[1:43:19] you need to come
[1:43:21] bail him out you know
[1:43:23] but i'm glad that they made it
[1:43:25] their way to the pool
[1:43:28] and the lord's dealt with miles's heart
[1:43:30] for several weeks and
[1:43:32] i like when it comes to that time when
[1:43:34] you can't do it no more
[1:43:37] amen maybe this morning god's moved on
[1:43:39] your heart
[1:43:41] that you want to make your life right
[1:43:44] that you're kind of borderlining
[1:43:48] that you're just playing the fence
[1:43:51] you haven't went to your home and you
[1:43:53] haven't applied the token
[1:43:55] you hadn't got rid of the things of the
[1:43:57] world you haven't kicked out the tv you
[1:43:59] haven't kicked out the dvr you haven't
[1:44:02] kicked out the games you haven't went in
[1:44:04] there and you haven't left the mark of
[1:44:06] the burning bush
[1:44:08] on your house in your life
[1:44:12] and you'd like the mark of the burning
[1:44:13] bush the holy spirit
[1:44:16] to place its mark on your life this
[1:44:18] morning
[1:44:22] maybe you'd like to do that this morning
[1:44:24] maybe you've never been baptized the
[1:44:26] pool's open
[1:44:30] and we'll baptize miles because god's
[1:44:32] dealt with his heart
[1:44:34] if god's dealing with your heart the
[1:44:36] pool's open
[1:44:38] let us stand this morning
[1:44:42] brother matt if you would go to
[1:44:45] get ready and
[1:44:48] one of the deacons will go help you
[1:44:54] but you want to ask yourself this
[1:44:56] morning
[1:44:58] i'm not seeing your lukewarm
[1:45:02] but i am going to say the world's trying
[1:45:04] to make you lukewarm
[1:45:08] and you'd like to lift your hand this
[1:45:10] morning to the lord
[1:45:15] and you like to say father
[1:45:17] i don't want to slip
[1:45:24] backwards today
[1:45:28] i don't want to backslide

[1:45:34] honest and you'll say lord i i am kind
[1:45:37] of backslid
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:44] a lot of mornings i get up and i don't
[1:45:46] read my bible i'm off to work
[1:45:51] a lot of my nights i'm just thinking of
[1:45:54] the problems of the job
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:00] lord i'm i'm getting lukewarm and i i
[1:46:03] don't even realize it
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:07] i'm cooling off
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:11] and i never understood it's the very
[1:46:13] wickedness of the world around me
[1:46:16] that's cooling me off
[1:46:21] it's the atmosphere
[1:46:24] of the world is
[1:46:28] trying to infect my life in my mind and
[1:46:31] my spirit
[1:46:36] and i want to stop this morning
[1:46:40] and i want to say lord i don't want to
[1:46:42] go backwards
[1:46:44] [Music]

[1:47:41] moses did all that he could do in
[1:47:43] himself
[1:47:46] and it failed

[1:58:35] this morning let us open our bibles
[1:58:38] if we would this morning
[1:58:41] to the
[1:58:44] second chapter of the book of acts
[1:58:48] and we'll start reading in
[1:58:51] the 36th verse
[1:58:54] the day of pentecost the spirit of god
[1:58:56] has fallen
[1:58:58] the disciples have come out under the
[1:59:00] street
[1:59:02] people are gathered in jerusalem from
[1:59:05] every nation every tongue
[1:59:08] and these men come out on the street the
[1:59:10] street they're anointed
[1:59:12] with the spirit of god
[1:59:14] some are
[1:59:17] thinking that they must be intoxicated
[1:59:21] others
[1:59:23] possibly thought they were mad
[1:59:25] but peter says no
[1:59:28] this is they're not mad this is what was
[1:59:30] promised
[1:59:32] that i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:59:34] flesh
[1:59:36] and so we picked up the great story
[1:59:41] he says therefore let all the house of
[1:59:43] israel know assuredly that god hath made
[1:59:47] the same jesus whom ye have crucified
[1:59:51] both lord and christ
[1:59:53] now when they heard this they were
[1:59:56] pricked in their heart who said unto
[1:59:58] peter and the rest of the apostles
[2:00:01] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:00:04] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:00:08] baptized every one of you
[2:00:11] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:00:13] remission of sins
[2:00:15] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:00:18] holy ghost
[2:00:20] for the promise is unto you
[2:00:23] and your children
[2:00:26] and to all that are far off
[2:00:30] even miles
[2:00:32] and even as many as the lord our god
[2:00:34] shall call
[2:00:35] and with many other words did he testify
[2:00:38] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[2:00:41] this up towards
[2:00:43] generation
[2:00:45] amen
[2:00:47] amen miles
[2:00:50] with the
[2:00:51] testimony
[2:00:53] that the lord has spoken to your heart
[2:00:56] and like the apostles of old your
[2:00:59] heart was pricked and you wanted to know
[2:01:01] what to do and the lord said be baptized
[2:01:04] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:01:07] and according to your confession
[2:01:09] according to the instructions of the
[2:01:11] word of god for our day
[2:01:13] we baptize you
[2:01:16] in the name of the father the son and
[2:01:19] the holy ghost by divine revelation
[2:01:23] we know that those titles were
[2:01:25] represented in one name
[2:01:27] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[2:01:29] baptize you in the name of the lord
[2:01:31] jesus christ
