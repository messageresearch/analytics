[8:33] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[8:34] this morning. You may turn around and
[8:36] welcome somebody.
[8:48] We'll have brother Orlando come [music]
[8:49] and open our service in a word of
[8:50] prayer.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; [music]
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads.
[9:08] Father, we come to you this morning,
[9:09] Lord God, on one accord, I believe.
[9:13] Father, you said in your word, Lord God,
[9:14] where two or three are gathered in your
[9:16] name, there is in the midst, Father.
[9:19] [music] So by that, Lord God, we welcome
[9:21] you, Lord God. We commit this service to
[9:23] you, Lord, for all the things that we've
[9:26] been through, Lord God, from from from
[9:28] that time up until this time, Lord God.
[9:30] [music]
[9:31] We have an expectancy, Lord, today to
[9:33] receive more of you, Lord God, that we
[9:36] may decrease, that you may increase
[9:39] [music] in our lives, Father. Let
[9:41] everything that be done here today, Lord
[9:43] God, be done in decency and in order,
[9:46] Lord God. Not to lift up man, Lord God,
[9:48] and an idea, Lord, but your word, Lord
[9:51] God. For you said in your word, if you
[9:53] be lifted up, that you'll draw all men
[9:55] unto thee, Lord God. So, Father, that
[9:57] together, Lord, we lift up your name,
[9:59] Lord God. For your name is above every
[10:01] name, that at your name every knee shall
[10:04] bow [music] and every tongue shall
[10:06] confess. We confess it before you today,
[10:08] Lord God, with an expectation in in our
[10:11] hearts, Lord God, that you'll bring it
[10:13] to pass. We love you today and we thank
[10:15] you once again. In the [music] name of
[10:17] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[10:23] Hallelujah. As as you're standing, we'll
[10:25] just turn to a [music] psalm reading.
[10:26] We'll read out of Psalm 30.
[10:34] We'll read it together from the 1st all
[10:36] the way to the 12th.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; I will extol thee, oh Lord, for thou has
[10:53] lifted me up and has not made my foes to
[10:56] rejoice over me. Oh Lord my God, I cried
[11:01] unto thee and thou has brought me healed
[11:04] me. Oh Lord, thou has brought me up my
[11:07] soul from the grave. Thou hast kept me
[11:10] alive that I should not go down to the
[11:13] pit. Sing unto the Lord, oh ye saints of
[11:17] his, and give thanks at the remembrance
[11:19] of his holiness. For his anger endureth
[11:23] but a moment, and his favor is life.
[11:26] Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
[11:30] cometh in the morning, and in my
[11:32] prosperity I said, I shall never be
[11:35] moved. Lord, by thy favor thou has made
[11:39] me my mountains to stand strong. Thou
[11:42] didest hide thy face, and I was
[11:44] troubled. I cried to thee, O Lord, and
[11:47] unto the Lord I made supplication. What
[11:51] profit is there in my blood? When I go
[11:53] down to the pit, shall the dust praise
[11:56] thee? Shall it declare thy truth? Here,
[12:00] O Lord, and have mercy upon me. Lord, be
[12:03] thou my helper. Thou hast turned me my
[12:07] mourning into dancing. Thou has put off
[12:10] my sackcloth and girded me with gladness
[12:13] to the end that my glory may sing praise
[12:16] to thee and not be silent. Oh Lord my
[12:19] God, I will give thanks unto thee
[12:22] forever. Amen. May the Lord add a
[12:24] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[12:25] may be seated. [clears throat]

[33:21] you [music] are not a God in need of
[33:26] anything we can give by your [music]
[33:29] prayer. That's just the way it is.

[34:43] can contain. [singing and music]

[34:49] [music] Praise the L.
[34:52] You're the only God is worthy
[34:56] of everything.
[34:59] You are God. [music]
[35:01] That's just [singing] the way.
[35:05] Oh, you are [music] God
[35:09] from before time. [singing]
[35:13] You are all [music]
[35:16] you are [singing]
[35:20] [music] right now.

[37:10] You are God [singing and music] alone.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Our gracious father,
[37:21] you are certainly God alone.
[37:24] We love you.
[37:29] We're so grateful for your [music]
[37:32] kindness towards us and your mercy,
[37:36] Father, that back before time ever was
[37:39] that you knew us and you thought about
[37:41] us and you knew we'd be here
[37:45] and you [music] were going to provide
[37:46] for us.
[37:48] Truly, you are a wonderful father,
[37:53] Lord. And we ask that today [music] that
[37:55] through your word we might become better
[37:58] children and better [music] servants of
[38:01] your great name. We ask you to bless the
[38:04] people this morning. May their hearts be
[38:07] lifted up. Father, [music] as we leave
[38:10] this
[38:12] mark in time,
[38:14] the year [music]
[38:15] 20
[38:17] 25, Father, we're going to leave that
[38:19] behind and go into a new year. But,
[38:24] Father, may our hearts and our zeal be
[38:26] new for you. We ask for your blessings
[38:29] [music] now. In Jesus' name we pray.
[38:33] Amen. Amen. You may be seated this
[38:36] morning.
[38:39] We're going to have a baby dedication
[38:41] this morning. And also, we'd like to uh
[38:46] uh welcome our [snorts] our guest uh
[38:50] today, Brother Francois and Susan
[38:53] Lupricar. Their daughter and
[38:55] granddaughter are here. So, brother,
[38:57] where you at? Stand up for us so we can
[38:59] all don't There they are.
[39:06] They're from the They're from the great
[39:10] country of Switzerland

[39:17] place. And everybody likes Switzerland.
[39:20] They're known for their chocolate and
[39:22] watches and their believers. And then we
[39:25] have Eli and Kendall with us today. And
[39:28] so we're we're just grateful for
[39:30] everybody. Did you all have a good
[39:32] Christmas?
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Are y'all wearing your new Christmas
[39:35] clothes?
[39:36] I'm wearing my Christmas tie today. I
[39:40] got a tie for Christmas and I I'm I'm
[39:43] grateful for that. And uh I asked some
[39:46] of the brothers if they got the sports
[39:48] car they wanted and nobody got the
[39:50] sports car they wanted. But but we got a
[39:54] better gift, didn't we? We got the son
[39:56] of our Lord. And and and that's that's
[40:00] what's the most marvelous part about it.
[40:03] and and uh just it's the love of God.
[40:08] God so loved the world he gave his only
[40:10] begotten son and then along with that
[40:13] came eternal life and every benefit for
[40:17] everything we need he's here for us. So
[40:21] uh we're just grateful for that. We're
[40:23] going to dedicate this morning uh uh
[40:26] brother Eli and Adriel's daughter Hannah
[40:29] Ka. And if they're here, if you would
[40:33] come up and and you know, I I like I
[40:38] like Hannah in the Bible. [music]
[40:42] &gt;&gt; She It's just such a great story.
[40:44] [snorts] If you ever want to be
[40:45] inspired, [music] read the second
[40:47] chapter of First Samuel. That's Hannah's
[40:51] prayer to the Lord. And she's talking
[40:54] about how great God is. And Hannah's
[40:58] name [music] means uh it means grace or
[41:03] favor.
[41:04] And uh so it's really wonderful uh to be
[41:09] named after [music] such a wonderful
[41:11] Bible character.
[41:13] Amen.
[41:16] Thank you. Hold her up. So, I'm
[41:21] let
[41:37] &gt;&gt; pray. Father God, we are grateful for
[41:40] this gift of life you have given us.
[41:43] It is written the brought to you little
[41:45] children and you bless them. This
[41:47] morning we come before you to dedicate
[41:49] Hannah. We ask you to protect her from
[41:51] the things of the world. May you be a
[41:54] portion. May you help her walk according
[41:56] to your word throughout her journey on
[41:58] this earth. May you protect her from
[42:01] sicknesses and grant her eternal life.
[42:03] We grant we we hold this baby this
[42:06] morning by your grace, a grace we do not
[42:08] deserve. Please help us to raise
[42:10] according to your word. As it is
[42:12] written, teach your children the way
[42:14] they should go. When they are old, they
[42:17] will not turn from it. Father, we thank
[42:19] you for this privilege this morning and
[42:21] ask all this in the name of Jesus
[42:22] Christ. Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our gracious father, what a
[42:28] marvelous namesake that Hannah's named
[42:32] after. Father, a prayer warrior, one
[42:36] that poured out her heart before the
[42:38] Lord with faith. And Lord, when she
[42:41] received what she had prayed for, she
[42:44] dedicated Samuel back to the service of
[42:47] the Lord. Father, it's a marvelous story
[42:50] of faith and dedication
[42:53] and perseverance
[42:55] and sacrifice. Father, may all the
[42:58] characteristics of the great namesake be
[43:02] placed in her. Father, may she be a
[43:04] shining light. Father, may her life
[43:07] produce fruit in life. We ask you to
[43:10] bless the parents, Father, as they raise
[43:13] her, Father. May they always keep you
[43:15] before her. May they always teach her
[43:18] the word of God. We ask your blessings
[43:20] on them now as they journey in life. and
[43:24] we ask you to keep her and encamp your
[43:27] angels about him. We ask it in Jesus
[43:30] precious name we pray. Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[43:38] Isn't it the Lord wonderful?
[43:41] Amen. How wonderful he is.
[43:46] I've taken a couple days off. So I' I've
[43:49] asked Matthew to preach for us this
[43:51] morning. Uh
[43:54] uh Billy's away in uh preaching. Brother
[43:57] Paul's going to be uh he's going to be
[44:01] going to uh out to uh Brazerville. And
[44:06] so we want you to pray for him. He
[44:09] leaves in this in January. So there's a
[44:13] lot of things uh going on, you know, but
[44:18] the world's changing rapidly.
[44:21] The worst part about it is it's moving
[44:23] farther away from the word of God and
[44:26] it's getting harder and harder to stay
[44:30] just with the truth just the way it's
[44:33] spoken. And you know the one thing that
[44:36] Satan does, he always tries to discredit
[44:38] the word of God that it won't work. But
[44:42] the word of God works. It'll never fail.
[44:46] it it it's it's forever
[44:49] ever true. Uh it endureth forever and
[44:54] God keeps his word.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; So, you know, we always talk about
[44:58] leaving one year and going into a new
[45:01] year and it's good to to steadfast in
[45:06] your heart to uh serve God. Uh we also
[45:11] have other people that are in town for
[45:13] the wedding. We want to greet all our
[45:15] visitors and everybody this morning.
[45:18] Keep us in prayer. I'm looking forward
[45:20] for the Lord to do wonderful things in
[45:24] the days ahead. I I believe the
[45:26] supernatural is our portion. It's our
[45:30] life and that God can do for us
[45:33] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[45:36] can even ask or think. So hold that
[45:39] faith there. Let's let's this year
[45:42] forward. Let's go. Faith is the key to
[45:46] the door and we really want that to be.
[45:48] So, brother Matthew, if you'd come at
[45:51] this time and musicians, thank you very
[45:53] much. Just ask Matthew to break the word
[45:56] of the Lord for us this morning. I
[45:58] appreciate his help today. God richly
[46:00] bless you.
[46:03] Amen. Why don't we all just
[46:06] It was a tiny simple stable.
[46:10] All beaten [singing]
[46:12] and [music] warm.
[46:15] Hardly a place [music and singing]
[46:18] for a king to be born.
[46:22] He didn't choose some place [music]
[46:24] special
[46:26] to reveal his majesty.
[46:30] So I know if I'll [music] give him
[46:33] control,
[46:35] he'll be [singing] born in me.
[46:38] Let your [music]
[46:40] word
[46:42] be born
[46:44] in the manger [singing] of my heart.
[46:48] [music] Let it live in me.
[46:51] [singing] Let it star
[46:55] [music]
[46:55] live inside this house of play.
[47:00] and [music] mold it every day. [singing]
[47:04] Let your word be born
[47:08] in the [music and singing] manger
[47:10] of my heart. Next verse.
[47:15] will outwardly [music] I'm nothing
[47:20] but much to behold
[47:24] my heart
[47:26] [music]
[47:27] for his word to unfold
[47:31] if [music] I'll just yield [singing]
[47:33] this vessel
[47:35] and let him have his way [singing]
[47:39] from glory on [music] to glory
[47:43] he'll change me day
[47:45] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[47:45] &gt;&gt; I hear [music]
[47:47] you
[47:48] for
[47:51] [singing]
[47:53] in the [music] manger of my heart.
[47:57] May [singing]
[47:59] be [music] let
[48:05] [singing] this house [music] away
[48:08] and hold it every day.
[48:13] that [music] you were born
[48:16] in the [singing] manger
[48:19] of my heart.
[48:22] Lord Jesus, we're just thankful that
[48:24] [music]
[48:25] we can be gathered together into your
[48:26] presence. And Lord, to be with brothers
[48:29] and sisters of precious like faith
[48:30] [music] and to have visitors with us,
[48:33] Lord, we just want you to be their
[48:36] portion. Lord, as we're still in what
[48:38] the world would call holiday seasons,
[48:41] Lord, we know a prophet told us that
[48:43] every [music] day is Christmas, Lord,
[48:45] and we want your word to be born into
[48:46] our heart, and to our lives, and into
[48:48] manifestation, Lord, into the things
[48:51] that we do, and [music] that we say,
[48:52] that we could give you honor and glory,
[48:54] Lord, that men might see our good works
[48:56] and they might glorify you, Lord. That
[48:58] it's not something that man can do, but
[49:00] it's the very word taking on flesh in
[49:03] your many [music] membered bride body.
[49:05] Lord, we love you. We just thank you,
[49:07] Lord. I'm incapable in myself to be able
[49:10] [music] to take your word and to uh
[49:12] divide it to your people. But if you
[49:14] would come, Lord, and you just [music]
[49:16] take the bread of life and rightly
[49:18] divide it as the sheep have need of it,
[49:21] Lord, I know it'll be a blessing and
[49:23] encourage them along the way. [music]
[49:25] Lord, whether it's chastisement, rebuke,
[49:27] correction, encouragement, deliverance,
[49:29] [music]
[49:30] Lord, we've come to the house of God
[49:32] that you would have your preeminence
[49:33] now. Lord, we just welcome you here just
[49:36] to have your perfect will and way in the
[49:38] service. We surrender [music] to you
[49:39] now. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:41] Christ, we pray. Amen. [music] Praise
[49:43] the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll
[49:45] be reading out of Luke chapter 2. Amen.
[49:47] It's it's just good to see uh the
[49:50] visitors here with us and we've come to
[49:53] know and love and uh also, Brother Eli
[49:56] and Sister Kendall, it's good to have
[49:57] you with us. Just dear friends of ours
[49:59] and uh many in for the wedding. So,
[50:02] we're just uh in in great expectation
[50:04] for what the Lord would have for us this
[50:07] morning and uh just see what the Lord
[50:10] will do. Luke chapter 2
[50:14] and we'll be reading
[50:17] verses 8
[50:20] through 18.
[50:22] I I almost uh
[50:25] want to read the whole chapter. Um you
[50:28] know how the word is. Uh but it says,
[50:30] "And there were in the same country
[50:32] shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
[50:35] watch over their flocks by night. And
[50:37] lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
[50:39] them, and the glory of the Lord shone
[50:40] round about them, and they were sore
[50:42] afraid." And the angel said unto them,
[50:44] "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good
[50:46] tidings of great joy, which shall be to
[50:50] all people, for unto you is born this
[50:52] day in the city of David, a Savior,
[50:54] which is Christ the Lord." Ain't that
[50:57] wonderful? And this shall be a sign unto
[51:00] you. Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
[51:03] swaddling clothes lying in a manger. And
[51:06] suddenly there was with the angel a
[51:09] multitude of heavenly hosts praising God
[51:11] and saying, "Glory to God in the
[51:13] highest, and on earth, peace and good
[51:16] will to men." And it came to pass as the
[51:18] angels were gone away from them into the
[51:20] heaven, the shepherds said one to
[51:21] another, "Let us go now even unto
[51:24] Bethlehem, and see this thing which has
[51:27] come to pass, which the Lord hath made
[51:30] known unto us." Isn't that wonderful?
[51:34] And when and they came with haste, I
[51:37] like that also. And found Mary and
[51:39] Joseph and the babe lying in a manger.
[51:42] And when they had seen it,
[51:44] now watch this. When they had seen what
[51:47] was spoken in manifestation, when they
[51:49] had seen it, they made known abroad the
[51:52] saying which was told them concerning
[51:54] this child, and all they that heard it
[51:57] wondered at those things which were told
[52:00] them by the shepherds. Amen. We ask a
[52:03] blessing on the word. You may be seated.
[52:05] Amen. Just still in maybe what we would
[52:07] call a holiday season. and with our our
[52:10] pastor ministering on Christmas, we're
[52:12] just in maybe that uh line of thought
[52:15] and that channel. And brother Brandham
[52:16] would say and why it had to be
[52:18] shepherds, which would be uh the source
[52:21] of my inspiration. He says, now I it's
[52:24] he says why this great event was
[52:26] revealed to shepherds. That would be
[52:29] kind of an outstanding thing for us. I
[52:32] have some scriptures written here and a
[52:34] few notes that I will try to run over to
[52:37] explain to you why to the best of my
[52:39] knowledge and maybe then after this that
[52:42] the Lord with his grace tonight will
[52:45] take the wise away from us. But mo most
[52:49] all of us I suppose at one time or
[52:51] another has wondered why that the
[52:53] greatest event
[52:55] of all times
[52:57] was revealed to shepherds. Why was it
[53:00] revealed to shepherds and not to the
[53:03] theologians of that day? They were the
[53:07] one that were trained to hear it. And
[53:10] why did it come to pass? Why did it come
[53:12] and bypass the rich and come to the poor
[53:16] also? Why did it bypass the learned and
[53:19] wise and come to the humble and
[53:22] unlearned? There's a few questions of
[53:24] why in this. And I want to pull from my
[53:27] inspiration where brother Brandham says,
[53:28] "And maybe then after this, the Lord
[53:30] with his grace tonight will take the
[53:32] wise away from us." I I want to minister
[53:34] to you on the thought of take the wise
[53:38] away from us. Not W, but Wy WHs, taking
[53:43] the question, if you will, or taking the
[53:45] Y away from us. And you know, I hope
[53:47] everybody had a good Christmas.
[53:50] You know, may maybe maybe some of you
[53:51] had a hard Christmas, but you know, you
[53:54] got some gifts, some you like and some
[53:57] you love and
[53:59] some that don't fit
[54:02] and some you don't know why. Like, why
[54:05] why did they get me this
[54:08] got me a spatula? I ain't planning on
[54:09] cooking.
[54:11] You know, sometimes that's the way it is
[54:13] with with Christmas and gifts and a and
[54:16] you know, you you people go they make an
[54:18] effort and and they they buy you
[54:20] something and sometimes you might you
[54:22] might might wonder why why did they get
[54:24] me this or or or or or even what is this
[54:27] thing? But I just wanted to point out
[54:29] one thing that is important is you want
[54:31] to appreciate the gift. You know,
[54:33] because people take time and they take
[54:35] effort and it's and it's a sacrifice and
[54:37] there's a cost and there's a
[54:38] thoughtfulness. And that word appreciate
[54:40] means to grasp the nature, the worth or
[54:43] the quality or the significance of. And
[54:45] and I want to just say the greatest gift
[54:47] that was ever given was Jesus Christ.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; And and and it's not that uh Christmas
[54:52] isn't about Santa Claus and all the
[54:54] tinsel and and all the bright lights and
[54:56] the commercial things that they've made
[54:58] it today. Uh because we know that a
[55:00] prophet has shown us, but that's pagan.
[55:01] that's that's ha and and he said you
[55:04] ought not to teach your kids those
[55:05] things because you know you teach them
[55:07] that you're going to have to correct it
[55:08] and you're going to and and if you have
[55:10] to correct them say well it was all a
[55:11] lie you know there's no thing such thing
[55:13] as Santa Claus he said you better watch
[55:15] out because they might think the same
[55:16] thing about Jesus Christ you see we got
[55:18] to be very careful the things that we
[55:20] teach and the things that we we pour
[55:22] ourselves into and the time and
[55:23] attention we give it and the credibility
[55:26] &gt;&gt; with the songs we sing and and sometimes
[55:28] we think they're innocent and sometimes
[55:30] we think they're nice and it's the
[55:32] holiday season, but here a prophet says
[55:34] it's pagan.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Well, come on. I'm preaching to
[55:38] believers.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; And we know what a prophet taught.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You know, we we know what the season's
[55:43] about. You know, every day is Christmas
[55:45] to the believers. So, some people take
[55:47] it off into legalism and they can't even
[55:49] uh uh slow down. And I'll tell you what,
[55:51] if the world's going to slow down and
[55:52] take a week or two off uh that we can
[55:54] have time with family and and and
[55:56] express our love to one another and take
[55:58] a little moment a a and reflect on the
[56:00] greatest gift that ever was given. Hey,
[56:02] I'll take that because I got a
[56:04] revelation. I know every day is
[56:05] Christmas, so you might want to
[56:07] criticize and tell me, "Well, you're
[56:08] giving presents and you're doing this."
[56:10] Well, yeah. Yeah, that's okay. I'm just
[56:12] glad the world's going to slow down for
[56:13] a little bit that I can take a little
[56:15] time, but every day is Christmas to me.
[56:17] So, so, so you want to criticize and be
[56:19] legalistic about it. Well, well, I want
[56:21] to tell you, if you've ever received the
[56:22] greatest gift that was ever given, that
[56:24] gift is so powerful. It's not limited to
[56:27] a holiday. It's not limited to a
[56:28] weekend. It's not limited to a Sunday.
[56:30] It's not limit limited to a Wednesday,
[56:33] but the greatest gift that ever was
[56:34] given was the Lord Jesus Christ. And I
[56:36] say, "Oh Lord, let your word be born in
[56:39] my heart and in my life."
[56:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say this and
[56:44] why it had to be shepherds. He said,
[56:45] "The name of Jesus Christ spoke life
[56:48] into a dead baby. What ought it do to a
[56:51] church that claims to be born again?"
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Well, we we know the story about how how
[56:59] the angel came unto uh uh Mary and and
[57:03] and and said, uh uh behold, thou hast
[57:05] found favor with the Lord and and you're
[57:09] going to be with child. And how how can
[57:11] these things be? He says, "Oh, the the
[57:12] Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you."
[57:15] And that thing that will be conceived in
[57:16] you. Oh, it's Emmanuel. It's Jesus
[57:19] Christ. That's what his name shall be
[57:20] called. And and she went over there and
[57:22] and testified to Elizabeth who had been
[57:25] with child for six months with the with
[57:27] the prophet John, right? Y'all know the
[57:29] story. And and what happened at the
[57:31] mention of the name?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; He says, "The name of Jesus spoke life
[57:38] into a dead baby. What ought it do to a
[57:40] church that claims to be born again? And
[57:43] we sit as sour as the bumps on a pickle
[57:46] and let such things go on and afraid to
[57:48] raise and testify your convictions and
[57:50] condemn all this nonsense. Make Jesus
[57:52] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[57:54] forever. It's Christmas time. Get out
[57:57] these Santa Clauses and stuff and away
[57:59] with that nonsense of commercializing
[58:01] wherever you heard about Santa Claus in
[58:03] the Bible. It's a Roman mythology.
[58:05] There's nothing at all. There's no such
[58:07] thing. Don't teach your children such
[58:08] nonsense as that when one day you'll
[58:10] have to tell them that it was all a
[58:12] blind story. Then you've lied to your
[58:14] child and it'll hurt your testimony
[58:16] about Jesus Christ. You'll say, "Well,
[58:18] maybe it's the same thing. Put Jesus
[58:20] Christ uh he said, "Put Jesus Christ,
[58:22] the great shepherd prophet, back into
[58:24] the Christmas where it belongs."
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. We ought to give the
[58:29] word and give God the preeminence and
[58:31] and put Christ, the great prophet
[58:33] shepherd back where it belongs into the
[58:35] first place in our life. It ought to be
[58:37] the very thing that we're living for,
[58:39] the very thing that we're thinking
[58:40] about. We ought to wake with aspirations
[58:42] of pleasing him.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; We that that's oh yeah, it's a holiday
[58:50] season. It's Christmas time. But every
[58:52] day ought to be Christmas. We ought to
[58:54] be living for the Lord. We ought to be
[58:55] living for Jesus. We ought to be
[58:57] thinking, "What can I do for him? Lord,
[58:59] lead me. Lord, guide me." Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Brother David, he read that quote about
[59:04] uh uh uh uh you know how how that that
[59:06] the old um uh what what do they call it?
[59:09] Were they wearing uh I'm trying to
[59:11] remember what the what they call those
[59:13] people the way they dressed uh uh back
[59:15] then in the 50s and 60s. But he said,
[59:17] you know, they they they wear leotard
[59:19] legotards and leotards and all these
[59:21] things and and these baggy clothes and
[59:23] and you know, they just sit around and
[59:25] they just uh just do anything that they
[59:27] they want to do and they just they let
[59:29] their minds travel and and you know,
[59:31] they just lay around and be lazy or they
[59:33] if they want to do something, they do
[59:35] it. If they don't want to do do it, they
[59:36] they don't do it. And brother Brandham
[59:38] said in that message, he he he said,
[59:40] "You have no right to do that because
[59:42] you're not your own. You are bought by
[59:44] deity." Jesus Christ, the son of God
[59:47] that was made flesh.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm reading a prophet. Feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:51] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:52] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:52] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel
[59:52] okay to to to to say amen to the word of
[59:54] God. You are bought by deity.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; You are you are bought with a price.
[1:00:00] Jesus Christ laid down his life for you.
[1:00:02] As the pope would say, I am redeemed.
[1:00:04] Bought with a price. Jesus has changed
[1:00:07] my whole life. If anybody asked you just
[1:00:09] who I am, tell him I am redeemed. Oh,
[1:00:12] you are bought by deity. just to think
[1:00:14] the very price that paid for your
[1:00:16] ransom, the very price to set you free
[1:00:18] and deliver you from your sins. You were
[1:00:20] bought by deity.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "We ain't
[1:00:25] got no right just to lay around loosey
[1:00:27] goosey and do whatever we want to do and
[1:00:29] dress any kind of way we want to dress
[1:00:30] and act any kind of way we want to act.
[1:00:32] You are bought with a price. You are not
[1:00:34] your own. You are bought by the blood of
[1:00:37] deity. Jesus Christ made flesh and come
[1:00:40] on this earth to hang on a tree that you
[1:00:42] might live.
[1:00:45] Talk about a Christmas message. Talk
[1:00:48] about a great gift that you who were
[1:00:50] once in bound and in sin with no hope
[1:00:53] and no way of escape. You were in bound
[1:00:56] to drugs and alcohol and addictions. Oh,
[1:00:58] but God sent the greatest gift that man
[1:01:01] has ever known. The man named Jesus
[1:01:03] Christ. And he wasn't only born in a
[1:01:05] manger, but he was hung on a tree on
[1:01:08] Calvary to pay the price for your sin
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; that you might be delivered.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; You were bought by deity.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Well, it shows the worth.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. I can't understand
[1:01:27] it. But when you go to buy a gift, what
[1:01:28] do you do? You make an exchange. And you
[1:01:31] got to deem the thing that you're
[1:01:32] purchasing worth the value that it's
[1:01:34] asking.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. You can buy a house and it'll
[1:01:41] go down in value. You can buy a car and
[1:01:43] it'll go down in value. You You can buy
[1:01:46] it clothes and it's going to wear out.
[1:01:48] But when Jesus Christ paid for you, you
[1:01:50] were bought with deity. It doesn't lose
[1:01:53] its value. It doesn't lose its worth.
[1:01:55] You are bought by the blood of Jesus
[1:01:57] Christ. You want to know how valuable
[1:01:59] you are this morning?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; You were bought by deity.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; You want to know how much you're worth?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; The great creator of heavens and earth
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; thought so much of you. [applause]
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will take their place. I
[1:02:20] will become a man. I will become a
[1:02:23] kinsman redeemer and I will lay down my
[1:02:26] life. I will purchase the whole field
[1:02:28] that I might buy that treasure.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You are that pearl of great price.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; You were bought with deity. Don't let no
[1:02:40] devil try to tell you you don't matter.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Try to tell you you don't you're not
[1:02:44] worth anything and and nobody notices
[1:02:46] you in church and and you come to church
[1:02:49] and nobody shakes your hand and nobody
[1:02:51] invited you over for Christmas and you
[1:02:53] had Thanksgiving all alone. I don't care
[1:02:56] if you have every Christmas alone, every
[1:02:58] Thanksgiving alone, every birthday
[1:03:00] alone. You were bought by the blood of
[1:03:02] Jesus Christ. You are not alone. He
[1:03:04] said, "I'll be with you, even in you
[1:03:07] until the end. Let the world mock you.
[1:03:09] Let the world scorn. Let everybody go
[1:03:11] this way and that way. But one thing I
[1:03:13] am sure of. I have been bought by
[1:03:15] deity."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:26] It is hot up here.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Bought
[1:03:33] by deity.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you though, that's how
[1:03:37] much God thought about you.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; How much do you think about him?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He laid down his life for you.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; How much do you think of him?
[1:03:54] For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:03:56] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:03:59] believeth in him might have should not
[1:04:02] perish but have eternal life. John 15:13
[1:04:05] says, "Greater love hath no man than
[1:04:07] this, that a man lay down his life for
[1:04:09] his friends. Ye are my friends if you do
[1:04:12] whatsoever I command you." Uhoh.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; How much do you think of this price?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching Bible. I'm preaching the
[1:04:21] message,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; If ye are my friends, if you do
[1:04:26] whatsoever I command you, henceforth I
[1:04:27] call you not servants. For the servant
[1:04:29] knoweth not what his lord doeth, but I
[1:04:31] have called you friends. For all things
[1:04:33] that I have heard of my father, I have
[1:04:36] made known unto you. I just love it. I I
[1:04:38] can't help it. But when it comes on and
[1:04:40] you're listening to the prophet and he
[1:04:42] says, "Friends, oh, it has a certain
[1:04:44] ring to me." When he starts to break the
[1:04:46] seals, he says, "I no longer church call
[1:04:48] you church. I call you bride." Why? It
[1:04:50] wasn't revealed to the theologians and
[1:04:53] the denominations of the world, but this
[1:04:55] truth has been revealed to the lonely,
[1:04:57] the meek, and the humble.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; I say, "What a gift."
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; The gift of eternal life, the gift of
[1:05:06] faith,
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; What a gift.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; What a gift.
[1:05:17] Brother Brandham said continuing in that
[1:05:19] message says the highest of heaven came
[1:05:21] down to make himself known to the lowest
[1:05:23] of the earth bypassing all between to
[1:05:26] make himself known to common herdsmen
[1:05:28] coming to give these common herdsmen the
[1:05:31] greatest message of all times.
[1:05:35] There had been many great messengers. We
[1:05:37] would think of Noah in his day and the
[1:05:39] prophets and the great priests and so
[1:05:40] forth had been had been in the days gone
[1:05:43] by the great learned man, kings,
[1:05:46] potentates, monarchs. But here he comes
[1:05:49] with the greatest of all the messages.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; What was the message?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Messiah is here now.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I say what is the message?
[1:06:07] Messiah is here now. While the church
[1:06:10] world is looking for event, some event
[1:06:13] to take place in the future, God has
[1:06:16] come and revealed himself to his bride.
[1:06:19] And what is the message of the hour? He
[1:06:22] is not dead, but he is alive. He is not
[1:06:25] just coming sometime in the future, but
[1:06:27] [screaming] Christ, the word has come
[1:06:29] and he is right here present amongst us.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder what kind of appreciation
[1:06:42] should we have.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; To think that all the patriarchs and all
[1:06:47] the apostles and the disciples and all
[1:06:50] those through the church ages look
[1:06:52] towards this hour that we are now living
[1:06:55] when the word has become flesh and the
[1:06:57] flesh is becoming word and a member
[1:07:00] bride body. [screaming] Christ is here
[1:07:03] now.
[1:07:04] Oh, you can look at me like a mule at a
[1:07:06] new new gate. But that's the message of
[1:07:09] the hour to declare that he is the same
[1:07:12] yesterday, today, and forever. I'm not
[1:07:14] looking into the past of what he only
[1:07:15] did. And I'm not just looking into the
[1:07:17] future, but I can recognize this present
[1:07:20] present tense among us right now.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may we have the right
[1:07:32] appreciation.
[1:07:35] grasp the nature, the worth, the
[1:07:38] significance of Calvary.
[1:07:41] But you know, imagine
[1:07:44] this this great message. Who was it
[1:07:46] revealed to?
[1:07:48] Bunch of shepherds.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Shepherds, nobody thought of the
[1:07:52] shepherds.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; The shepherds, they were unlearned.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You know, you go out and see those
[1:07:58] shepherds, you know, they they sleep
[1:08:00] with the sheep.
[1:08:02] They they walk the hills with them. And
[1:08:04] you want to know who their friends and
[1:08:05] their companions are?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Sheep.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; They'll walk miles and they'll roam the
[1:08:10] field and they'll lead their sheep into
[1:08:12] pastures.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; All alone walking alone. That's what a
[1:08:16] pastor does. Many times he stands alone.
[1:08:18] And everybody wonders why is he doing
[1:08:20] the things he's doing? Why is he going
[1:08:22] this way? Because he stands alone with
[1:08:24] God leading his sheep into greener
[1:08:26] pastures.
[1:08:29] All right.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; They start to laugh like the sheep and
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; you know they smell like the sheep and
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; they start to, you know, they don't
[1:08:38] really, if I can almost say it, they
[1:08:40] dress like the sheep. They need to stay
[1:08:43] warm and they're going to hang out with
[1:08:45] them and and here the greatest message
[1:08:48] that was ever declared
[1:08:51] [snorts] was revealed to shepherds.
[1:08:54] Well, why?
[1:08:57] Well, he wouldn't come and not to the
[1:09:00] great big organizations and to the great
[1:09:02] big churches and and to everybody that
[1:09:04] had it figured out and and the big uh uh
[1:09:06] you know, they they had the synagogues
[1:09:08] and all these things and and they were
[1:09:10] trained right and and they had an ear to
[1:09:11] hear and and they were studying all all
[1:09:14] the all the all the the the the Old
[1:09:16] Testament and the law of Moses and
[1:09:18] everything in there. And if anybody
[1:09:20] would have been trained and anybody
[1:09:22] should have saw it, but brother Bannon
[1:09:24] points out that their teaching had them
[1:09:26] leaning the wrong way
[1:09:28] because of their organization and
[1:09:30] because of of their learning. They would
[1:09:32] very they would miss the very message of
[1:09:34] the hour.
[1:09:37] Christ
[1:09:39] born into a manger. Why? It had to be
[1:09:42] shepherds. You know, a shepherd wouldn't
[1:09:44] he wouldn't worry about going into that
[1:09:45] stinky manger.
[1:09:48] Come on.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And I say that's one thing about God's
[1:09:50] children. They they they don't mind
[1:09:51] going where the word is.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; I don't need some orchestra. I don't
[1:09:56] need some polished choir. I don't need
[1:09:58] some big church. I don't need some big
[1:10:01] programs. I don't need somebody to
[1:10:02] babysit my child. What I need is in the
[1:10:05] word. And if it's in a manger, let me go
[1:10:07] into a manger. If it's down on the
[1:10:08] street corner, let me go to the street
[1:10:10] corner. But I want to tell you, I want
[1:10:12] to be where the word is.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why did it have to be shepherds?
[1:10:20] Brother Brandham shows how he never
[1:10:22] revealed it to the educated or the
[1:10:23] religious people of the day.
[1:10:26] He says in paragraph 76, he says you
[1:10:28] they would say you've you've been
[1:10:30] bewitched by some evil spirit that
[1:10:32] caused you to say such.
[1:10:35] You wonder why you get the looks that
[1:10:37] you get when you tell tell the people
[1:10:38] that God sent a prophet
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; and that Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30 and
[1:10:43] Revelations 10 1-7 has been fulfilled.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:47] Somebody's bewitched you
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; and I wonder if we've become afraid to
[1:10:52] share it
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; with the greatest message that has ever
[1:10:56] hit the planet and God has revealed it
[1:10:59] to you and we're afraid.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; These shepherds, what did they do? They
[1:11:03] went declaring to all Christ is here.
[1:11:07] Dirty, stinking, illiterate shepherds.
[1:11:10] They weren't worried about their
[1:11:11] reputation. They didn't have no
[1:11:13] reputation. They weren't worried about
[1:11:15] what man thought of them because they
[1:11:16] were out there with their sheep. But one
[1:11:18] thing they knew, it had been declared to
[1:11:21] them that the Messiah is here. I say if
[1:11:24] you appreciate and have caught a
[1:11:26] revelation of the message of the hour,
[1:11:28] there ought to be something in your life
[1:11:30] declaring Christ the Messiah is here.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; You've been bewitched
[1:11:40] by some evil spirit that caused you to
[1:11:43] say such.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yet it was according to the word of God.
[1:11:48] And they were too blind to see it
[1:11:49] because their theology had blinded them.
[1:11:51] What a tragedy. Caught in such a place
[1:11:54] in such a mess as that. What? Caught.
[1:11:57] Here's how he's saying. Caught in such a
[1:11:59] place and such a mess as that. This was
[1:12:02] in a stable.
[1:12:05] You mean in Jeffersonville? Can any good
[1:12:08] thing come out of Jeffersonville?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Out of a muddy swamp?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Out of a no education.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Not even seventh grade. Barely
[1:12:19] illegitimate. Come from a family of
[1:12:20] moonshiners.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; H what a [screaming] tragedy.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Caught in such a place and such a mess
[1:12:28] as this in a stable when they had a
[1:12:30] beautiful place for him to come.
[1:12:32] They had everything fixed up for him to
[1:12:34] come. And to think that he would come
[1:12:36] down and go and not bring their teachers
[1:12:40] the message
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; and would give it to a bunch of
[1:12:43] unlearned shepherds
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; and then bring his own son and have him
[1:12:48] born in a stable.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; A common livery stable.
[1:12:56] Well, in a manger of hay.
[1:12:59] Why?
[1:13:01] It couldn't be so.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't believe it
[1:13:07] because it was so humble.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; You know, many times a gift can be
[1:13:12] unrecognized.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Underappreciated,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; devalued,
[1:13:19] even unused,
[1:13:20] which I need to repent to my brother
[1:13:22] David. He bought me a very very nice uh
[1:13:24] h cooking kit to to to cook these steaks
[1:13:28] to perfection. And I haven't used it.
[1:13:32] But you know what I'm going to do?
[1:13:34] I'm going to go home and use it
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; cuz I want to appreciate and I do
[1:13:38] appreciate that gift. I haven't gotten
[1:13:40] around to do it. But you know what? Hey,
[1:13:41] maybe under a little conviction. I
[1:13:43] should have showed my appreciation. I I
[1:13:44] should have already broke that thing out
[1:13:46] and I should already cooked him and his
[1:13:47] wife some steaks and brought them over.
[1:13:49] So, David, I really appreciate that that
[1:13:50] you got for me. And how long has it
[1:13:52] been? He got that for me a year or two
[1:13:53] ago.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I'm preaching on myself
[1:13:57] a little bit. They they say that that
[1:14:00] billions go unused in in gift cards.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Billions go unused in gift cards because
[1:14:06] what happens is is somehow we lose the
[1:14:09] value. There's not the appreciation.
[1:14:12] Maybe you don't understand what it can
[1:14:14] do.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand the
[1:14:18] purchasing power.
[1:14:20] Maybe you thought it was just $25, but
[1:14:23] they but they really put $2500 on there
[1:14:27] and they're waiting for you to go to the
[1:14:29] store and buy your little $25. And they
[1:14:31] said, "Here's your receipt. You you you
[1:14:33] you still have $2,425
[1:14:37] left." And you'd be like, "Whoa, if I
[1:14:39] would have known that, I would have went
[1:14:40] to the store a lot sooner." What about
[1:14:42] the message of the hour? Do we even
[1:14:44] understand the benefits? Do we even
[1:14:47] understand the value? Do we even
[1:14:49] understand the purchasing power of the
[1:14:51] message of the hour? It'll give you your
[1:14:53] family. It'll give you your children.
[1:14:55] It'll give you [screaming] your health.
[1:14:56] It'll give you salvation. It'll give you
[1:14:58] deliverance. It'll give you your heart's
[1:15:00] desire.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because [screaming] it's Christ.
[1:15:06] Christ is here.
[1:15:09] [cheering]
[1:15:11] [applause]
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He said it's so simple. That's how the
[1:15:17] wise always overlooks it. It's so
[1:15:20] simple. It confounds them.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; They look for God way out there when
[1:15:26] he's right here.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; See, they're looking for something way
[1:15:30] yonder
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; when it's right here with them.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Christ risen from the dead.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:15:43] I want to tell you, he is not dead. He
[1:15:46] is alive. He is right here present with
[1:15:49] us this morning. He is not way out there
[1:15:52] somewhere yonder. He's not somewhere out
[1:15:54] there in the future. But Christ, the
[1:15:56] word [screaming] is present right here,
[1:15:58] right now. This morning, I say, why
[1:16:00] don't you open up your heart and receive
[1:16:02] them? Why don't we start showing the
[1:16:04] appreciation and the love and the
[1:16:06] worship and the thanksgiving?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You know, when my kids get something
[1:16:12] they like, you know what they do? They
[1:16:15] shout,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; they scream,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; they say, "Thank you. I always wanted
[1:16:21] this." I say, when the greatest gift
[1:16:23] that was ever given unto man is being
[1:16:25] read out and delivered to the church,
[1:16:27] there ought to be something in your
[1:16:28] heart saying, "Amen. Thank you. Glory to
[1:16:32] God. That's me. That's mine."
[1:16:34] [screaming]
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; But it's one thing to say you thank you
[1:16:40] and you got it. It's another thing to
[1:16:42] use it.
[1:16:44] and to put it to use.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say they believe the
[1:16:50] message,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; but it's not an action.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. You still wearing those same old
[1:16:57] clothes.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I got a brand new suit. I got a brand
[1:17:01] new car. Glory to God. God sent a
[1:17:03] prophet. Well, why are you still wearing
[1:17:05] the same things?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Why are you still driving the same car?
[1:17:10] Why you still dancing like the world?
[1:17:13] Why you still wearing makeup? Why you
[1:17:15] still cutting your hair?
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder if it's because we don't value.
[1:17:19] We don't have an appreciation. We really
[1:17:21] don't know what we got. But what we need
[1:17:23] is a revelation.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] [applause]
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Christ is here.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but
[1:17:36] I have chosen you
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should go and
[1:17:41] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:17:44] should remain that whatsoever you ask
[1:17:46] the Father in my name, he may give it to
[1:17:48] you.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; These things I command you that you love
[1:17:52] one another.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we should value
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; one another.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Look on the needs of one another. It's
[1:18:00] amazing how we give attention to those
[1:18:04] things that in our own carnal thinking
[1:18:08] we deem valuable.
[1:18:12] Like this is, you know, this is, you
[1:18:16] know, I'm going to keep preaching on
[1:18:17] myself. My mom got me a little travel
[1:18:19] tie thing and I I was like, you know,
[1:18:23] maybe I could use this. And I found out
[1:18:25] how much it cost. I said, I'm going to
[1:18:28] use this. I realized the thoughtfulness
[1:18:31] and the time and the sacrifice and what
[1:18:34] the cost was and how thoughtful it was
[1:18:35] and I I looked at it again like you know
[1:18:37] what and it made me press a little
[1:18:39] harder. I was like absolutely and I
[1:18:40] realized it it was a very meaningful and
[1:18:42] a gift that I could very use. But you
[1:18:44] know what's amazing what we give value
[1:18:46] to
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; we got a house full of people who were
[1:18:52] bought by deity
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; and we give our time and attention to
[1:18:56] the things of the world. You've spent
[1:18:58] more time on Instagram and Snapchat than
[1:19:00] you have with the house of God.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Well, these things I command that you
[1:19:06] love Instagram,
[1:19:08] that you love Facebook, that you love
[1:19:12] the Cowboys.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know who would do that.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Are you following? Okay. Amen.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Because the things you love are the
[1:19:25] things that you give your time and
[1:19:26] attention. You know, time is purchasing
[1:19:28] power.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; What are you purchasing with your time
[1:19:31] and your attention?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You purchasing h [screaming]
[1:19:36] I did it. I conquered the game.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; I beat a bunch of unknown people out in
[1:19:42] the universe that I'll never meet. I'm a
[1:19:44] hero.
[1:19:48] Mom, Dad, guess what? I'm number one on
[1:19:51] Minecraft.
[1:19:53] Minecraft
[1:19:55] that you're talking about that old Atari
[1:19:57] game where you hit like you tried to
[1:19:59] avoid the bombs. Remember it show the
[1:20:02] little numbers? Oh, number four. That
[1:20:03] means there's four minds around this
[1:20:05] one. I I I was at I was at a restaurant
[1:20:08] one day and this guy was driving a
[1:20:10] Lamborghini and so I got to talking to
[1:20:12] him a little bit and he and he said uh
[1:20:15] and he said uh he goes, "Yeah, man. No,
[1:20:16] no. I I got this many followers on my
[1:20:19] channel. I got millions of followers.
[1:20:21] I'm ranked this, this, and this. And he
[1:20:22] goes, "Yeah, I make millions on my my
[1:20:24] channel." He goes, "On Minecraft?" I
[1:20:25] went, "You make millions playing that
[1:20:28] little Atari game?" He's like, "No,
[1:20:30] that's mind sweep.
[1:20:32] I'm talking about mine. I didn't know
[1:20:33] what he was talking about, but to think
[1:20:35] the people pour out their time and their
[1:20:37] value to hitting some little
[1:20:44] dup.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; One hour, two hour. Doop, doop, doop,
[1:20:49] doop, doop.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; I'm tired. Um,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; and Jesus himself began.
[1:20:58] Lord, it's been a good day.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Where's your value?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Where's your appreciation?
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] What about those of the household of
[1:21:13] faith?
[1:21:15] Galatians 6:10, "As we have therefore
[1:21:17] opportunity,
[1:21:19] let us do good unto all men."
[1:21:23] Does anybody know what the rest is?
[1:21:25] Especially,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; unto them who are of the household of
[1:21:30] faith,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; but it makes me think there's a coming a
[1:21:34] day where Jesus is going to stand there.
[1:21:36] They're say, "Where did you get your
[1:21:37] scars?"
[1:21:39] in the house of my friends. And I think
[1:21:42] many of us are wounded, many of us are
[1:21:43] beaten, many of us are crying, many of
[1:21:45] us are hurt. Where where where have you
[1:21:48] been hurt the most? In the house of my
[1:21:50] friends.
[1:21:52] When we when we let politics and we we
[1:21:54] we let we let opinions and we let
[1:21:57] favoritism and we let oh this should be
[1:22:00] done that way and that should be done
[1:22:01] that way and we develop grudges and
[1:22:04] insecurities and complexes and we start
[1:22:07] to get divided and when somebody wants
[1:22:09] to step up and do something they think
[1:22:11] it's all selfish motive and they're just
[1:22:14] trying to promote themselves. I want to
[1:22:15] tell you that's the devil.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, help me preach this morning.
[1:22:20] We're supposed to be a household of
[1:22:21] faith that loves one another and
[1:22:24] especially unto them who are in the
[1:22:26] household of faith.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; What does Paul say in 1 Corinthians 12?
[1:22:29] I'm talking about being bought by deity,
[1:22:31] right? He says, "And those members of
[1:22:33] the body which we think to be less
[1:22:34] honorable
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; upon these we bestow more abundant
[1:22:39] honor." So just remember the next time
[1:22:42] you think I can't even that so and so I
[1:22:44] mean my goodness gracious I can't even
[1:22:46] stand. They are just a, you know, every
[1:22:48] time they do it, there's just this and
[1:22:49] that. I can't stand to be, you know,
[1:22:51] they're just, I'm telling you what,
[1:22:52] they're my least favorite person.
[1:22:55] There's your calling card.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to buy them a gift.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I did it not say bestow unto them
[1:23:04] more abundant honor.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But we got our clicks, we got our crew,
[1:23:09] we got our friends,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and we we go out of our way to exclude
[1:23:14] people.
[1:23:16] We we make we make excuses
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; to cut people out.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; We we we we were real we're real careful
[1:23:25] on how we organize an event because we
[1:23:28] don't want certain people to know.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I'm right where I need to be this
[1:23:36] morning.
[1:23:38] I told you the time uh one time where a
[1:23:40] brother coming uh flew into town and he
[1:23:43] said he said, "Oh, brother Matthew, I
[1:23:45] just got into the airport and I'm on a
[1:23:47] layover a little bit and I was wondering
[1:23:49] if you had some time for fellowship."
[1:23:50] And I was really busy. I didn't have any
[1:23:53] time.
[1:23:54] And I I said, "Well, brother, I I can
[1:23:57] see what I can do. I got a lot lot going
[1:23:59] on right now." And I I said, "Uh I I
[1:24:02] I'll let I'll let you know." I hung up
[1:24:03] the phone and that still small voice
[1:24:05] said, "If it was Brother Tom Ray, you
[1:24:06] would have dropped everything you were
[1:24:08] doing and ran and picked him up." I
[1:24:09] went, "Oh,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; ouch.
[1:24:13] Oh,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; because what was I doing carnally? I was
[1:24:18] putting value on what I cherish as a
[1:24:21] friendship." But God is calling us to a
[1:24:24] higher calling. He's calling us to the
[1:24:26] capstone of love that looks beyond our
[1:24:29] wants and our desires and our little
[1:24:31] circles and looks on the knees of one
[1:24:34] another. Says, you know what? We ought
[1:24:35] to include so and so. They may be having
[1:24:37] a hard time. They don't have any
[1:24:39] friends. Let's let's pull somebody in
[1:24:41] because I want to tell you, if we don't
[1:24:43] pull them in, somebody else will.
[1:24:45] There's a whole world of wolves
[1:24:46] [screaming] waiting to devour our young
[1:24:48] people and our children and our young
[1:24:50] married couples. I say let's get the
[1:24:52] Holy Ghost back in the church and in the
[1:24:55] congregation and start showing one
[1:24:57] another love.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; That is right.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; We bestow more abundant honor and our
[1:25:07] uncumbly parts have more abundant
[1:25:08] comeliness. For our comely parts have no
[1:25:11] need. But God hath tempered the body
[1:25:13] together, hath given more abundant honor
[1:25:15] to the part which lacked.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; So whoever here you thought you were the
[1:25:20] least We bestow the most abundant honor
[1:25:24] upon you.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And whoever you think deserves the most
[1:25:28] abundant honor,
[1:25:30] well, those who exalt themselves shall
[1:25:32] be abased.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And those who humble themselves shall be
[1:25:36] exalted.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That there should be no schisms. Why?
[1:25:43] That there should be no schisms in the
[1:25:44] body. What is the schism?
[1:25:50] Yell it out.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Division.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Division. That there shouldn't be no
[1:25:55] division in the body, but that the
[1:25:57] members should have the same care
[1:26:01] for only your inner circle.
[1:26:05] For only those
[1:26:07] that make you feel nice, warm, and
[1:26:09] fuzzy. For only those that get your
[1:26:12] jokes.
[1:26:14] For only those who liked you on
[1:26:16] Instagram.
[1:26:18] for only those who gave a thumbs up to
[1:26:23] your favorite store.
[1:26:26] No,
[1:26:28] having the same care
[1:26:30] one for another.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, it's going home time.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; This is capstone hour.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; This is rapture hour. And and I want to
[1:26:41] say there's a striking drift from the
[1:26:44] very core values and character in life
[1:26:47] of the message of the hour.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You know, we would start to question
[1:26:54] speaking about this message by the help
[1:26:56] of God. Take the wise away from us. Why
[1:27:00] does so and so do that? Why do they act
[1:27:02] that way? Their kids are always like, I
[1:27:04] I wonder why. What's going on at the
[1:27:06] house? You know, maybe it's in the
[1:27:08] church. Why does brother David do the
[1:27:10] things that he do? Why do the deacons
[1:27:12] always do that?
[1:27:14] Well, I want to ask you, why don't you
[1:27:16] do what the deacons ask you to do?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; It's striking to me that the deacons
[1:27:20] put, I'm going to let it go. We should
[1:27:23] we should we should uh uh my goodness,
[1:27:25] we should have a love of God in our
[1:27:27] heart and we should be humble and
[1:27:29] obedient. And you know, if a brother
[1:27:31] asks you something, my Bible tells me if
[1:27:32] they asked for your for your coat to
[1:27:34] give them your cloak also, we can't even
[1:27:36] honor you if they asked you to sit down
[1:27:38] somewhere.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; I have you to know I pay more tithe than
[1:27:42] you.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Well, what are we doing, church?
[1:27:48] [crying]
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; We maybe all these questions. The
[1:27:51] question is, why are you acting the way
[1:27:53] you're acting?
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I say, oh God, take the wise away from
[1:27:57] us and give us the love of God. Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; May the gift of God be shed abroad in
[1:28:04] our hearts.
[1:28:06] May
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; may it replace the wise with compassion
[1:28:08] and love,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; understanding and forgiveness.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me okay this morning?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Because we have a lot of questions
[1:28:19] sometime. Why did so and so do that and
[1:28:21] why this and why that? Why don't we have
[1:28:24] some love and compassion? And why don't
[1:28:25] we go into prayer?
[1:28:28] Why don't we seek the Lord and seek what
[1:28:30] God is trying to do and how he's trying
[1:28:31] to mold our character and maybe allowing
[1:28:34] situations and things to come in as an
[1:28:36] opportunity for you to be Christ to
[1:28:38] somebody. That's what I always say when
[1:28:40] a when a problem pumps comes up and
[1:28:42] there's some situation and and this
[1:28:44] person's mad at this person and and Joey
[1:28:46] shoved Sue and Susie and Susie uh talked
[1:28:49] back to to to the deacon and and all
[1:28:51] this stuff and you know what it ends up
[1:28:53] doing? You know, not only do the kids
[1:28:54] get hurt, but the kids are going to move
[1:28:56] on.
[1:28:58] And you know, they're going to be a
[1:28:59] different age in one year. They're going
[1:29:01] to go from being a little girl to
[1:29:03] driving a car. And all that little stuff
[1:29:05] in the parking lot's going to be all
[1:29:07] over with. But you want to know the
[1:29:08] people who are still stewing over it?
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; The parents,
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; broken fellowship, not inviting people
[1:29:15] over anymore, shunning them and scaring
[1:29:17] them, not even not even having the love
[1:29:19] of God enough to look them in the eyes
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; and shake their hand and say, "Sister, I
[1:29:23] love you."
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Brothers, be able to Somebody's offended
[1:29:27] you, you go the other way.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, some of us need to
[1:29:32] repent
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; because we claim we got the love of God
[1:29:35] in our life. And and sure we do, but
[1:29:37] there's some areas in our heart and
[1:29:39] there's some avenues. I say there's a
[1:29:41] door in your heart and we need the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost to come walk through those doors
[1:29:46] and in all those rooms and to those
[1:29:48] areas that you shut off from the Holy
[1:29:50] Ghost. And we need a real repentance, a
[1:29:52] real shaking, and getting back to the
[1:29:54] love of God.
[1:29:57] Well, come on, church. Let's have church
[1:29:59] this morning. Don't sit on me. It's time
[1:30:01] to go in a rapture.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; First Peter 4:8 says, "And above all
[1:30:10] things, have fervent charity among
[1:30:13] yourselves,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; for charity shall cover the multitude of
[1:30:18] sin. Use hospitality one to another
[1:30:22] without
[1:30:23] grudging.
[1:30:25] Oh, I tell you what, the Holy Ghost
[1:30:27] knows how to talk.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll go shake their hand. I'll go
[1:30:32] make it right. The Bible says if you
[1:30:33] have a lot in your heart, I I'll go
[1:30:35] make, you know, if I got to invite them
[1:30:37] over, if I got to do this,
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; No, he's not asking for legalism.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; He's asking for love. For God so loved
[1:30:47] the world, a dirty, rotten, stinky,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; sinful,
[1:30:54] no righteousness, but God so loved the
[1:30:56] world.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And if that love be in us, ought not we
[1:31:00] love one another, and above all, have
[1:31:03] fervent charity among yourselves.
[1:31:06] Okay, moving on.
[1:31:09] speaking on this thought around the
[1:31:10] Christmas season. You know, a gift, you
[1:31:14] know, you want it to be useful. It
[1:31:15] solves a problem. It helps with a task.
[1:31:19] It doesn't do any good if you don't use
[1:31:22] it.
[1:31:25] Cuz sometimes if you don't know how to
[1:31:26] use it, you need to read the directions.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You you you need to open it up. You need
[1:31:33] to look at the manual. You know, I was
[1:31:35] installing some some some volume knobs.
[1:31:38] at my house and and uh you know the
[1:31:41] thing wasn't quite matching up and and I
[1:31:43] took the screws out where that were
[1:31:45] holding on uh the little fake plate on
[1:31:46] there or whatever the little cover you
[1:31:48] know and I tried to put the new one in
[1:31:50] and and uh it didn't wasn't lining up
[1:31:52] correctly and everything and I was like
[1:31:53] man I well I guess I can use the the two
[1:31:56] that were covering the other one to get
[1:31:57] it in there but I need to go get two
[1:31:59] more and maybe I'll paint the paint them
[1:32:01] white so it doesn't stick out and and
[1:32:03] you know what I called I called my good
[1:32:05] buddy Dylan to come over and help me a
[1:32:06] little bit you know and And uh he come
[1:32:09] on over there and he's like he was
[1:32:10] looking at he goes well you know he's
[1:32:12] like uh he goes yeah those go in right
[1:32:14] there but you need two two other two
[1:32:16] other screws right here. I was like yeah
[1:32:18] you know I mean I I thought he was like
[1:32:19] well they should be in the box.
[1:32:23] They should be in the box. He grabbed
[1:32:24] the box. He opened up the box. He looked
[1:32:26] in the box. He goes they're right here.
[1:32:28] Here's exactly what you need. I got to
[1:32:31] thinking about that. You know what? Uh
[1:32:33] many times we're looking for all these
[1:32:35] things and we're trying to solve all
[1:32:36] these problems and I got to go down here
[1:32:38] and I got to do this and I need a job
[1:32:40] raising and and I need a new car and and
[1:32:42] I need to do this and and we're trying
[1:32:44] to solve all these problems. But I want
[1:32:46] to tell you all you do is got to look in
[1:32:47] the box. Just look into the greatest
[1:32:49] gift that God has ever given you. He
[1:32:51] gives you the message of the hour and I
[1:32:53] want to tell you everything that you
[1:32:55] have need of is right there in the box.
[1:32:58] There's your joy. There's your
[1:33:00] salvation. There's your peace. There's
[1:33:02] your healing. There's your deliverance.
[1:33:05] There's your Holy [screaming] Ghost.
[1:33:06] There's your sanctification. Come on,
[1:33:08] somebody help me preach this morning.
[1:33:10] Everything that you have needed has been
[1:33:13] given unto you by a vindicated prophet
[1:33:16] according to Malachi 4:5. Declaring
[1:33:18] Christ is here.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We just need to look
[1:33:27] into the box. Now, we're to our text. We
[1:33:31] only got one service this morning.
[1:33:33] Everybody feeling okay?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 2:17.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's all right. I'm having a good time
[1:33:44] in his presence.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing. I know whom I
[1:33:48] have believed in and I am persuaded.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not worried about politics. I'm
[1:33:56] not worried about favoritism. I'm not
[1:33:58] worried about my what may come in one
[1:34:00] week or two week. I'm not so much even
[1:34:02] worried what's happened in the past
[1:34:04] because oh I'm so thankful that Christ
[1:34:07] Jehovah has taken the wise away.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; While other people are worrying and
[1:34:12] they're wondering and they're sitting on
[1:34:14] the word and they can't have joy and
[1:34:16] they can't have peace and they can
[1:34:18] hardly express themselves. I wonder why.
[1:34:21] But I wonder if there's a people that's
[1:34:23] gotten so far away from their wants and
[1:34:25] their desires, they ain't worried about
[1:34:27] why. They're just worried about is he
[1:34:28] here? And we have a messenger that has
[1:34:30] declared he is present right here this
[1:34:33] morning. He is in the building. So I
[1:34:36] don't care about it. I just want to
[1:34:38] worship him. I just want to praise him.
[1:34:40] I just want to say amen to the word. He
[1:34:42] has taken my wise away. He has answered
[1:34:45] my questions.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 21:17 it says, "And when
[1:34:50] they had seen it, they made known to
[1:34:52] Braon the saying which was told them
[1:34:54] concerning this child."
[1:34:57] Oh, hallelujah. God has given us a
[1:34:59] message.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And this is where you'll find everything
[1:35:02] that you have needed. The prophet of God
[1:35:04] said this. He says, "Because the angel
[1:35:06] that gave them the message, they found
[1:35:08] it just exactly the way the angel said
[1:35:11] it would be." And it's just in the place
[1:35:14] where the angel said it would be. What a
[1:35:16] thing that had must have been to them.
[1:35:19] Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're catching catching
[1:35:23] the message, but I want to tell you it's
[1:35:25] everything the prophet said it was.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; And I have found everything that he said
[1:35:32] to be exactly thus saith the Lord.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[1:35:48] Or or is it just tradition?
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Is it just rules?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Is it just a I have to?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; This message is exactly what the angel
[1:35:59] said it was.
[1:36:01] What do you have need of this morning?
[1:36:03] What is your heart's desire? What are
[1:36:05] the questions in your heart? What are
[1:36:07] you going through? I want to tell you,
[1:36:09] it's everything.
[1:36:12] Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:36:15] the sins of the world. This isn't just
[1:36:17] some history lesson. This isn't just
[1:36:19] some some something that that that that
[1:36:22] oh that happened, you know, 60 years ago
[1:36:25] and and now we're just sitting around
[1:36:26] waiting for the coming of the Lord
[1:36:28] someday. Oh, if that's where if that is
[1:36:30] the condition you are in, you have
[1:36:33] missed the message of the hour because
[1:36:35] the angel, what was he saying? What was
[1:36:38] he telling those shepherds? Look, go
[1:36:40] there and you will find the word made
[1:36:42] flesh exactly where it said it was. and
[1:36:45] a prophet of God come showing and
[1:36:47] telling they search the scriptures and
[1:36:49] then you think you have eternal life and
[1:36:50] they are they that testify of me if
[1:36:53] you're looking for something coming in
[1:36:55] the future then you're missing what he's
[1:36:57] doing right now
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; he goes on to say may I now introduce my
[1:37:04] Christmas message and while I'm closing
[1:37:07] out Jesus Christ the same today and
[1:37:09] forever
[1:37:11] it's that same lamb he's just as much
[1:37:14] the lamb today as he was then. He's just
[1:37:17] as much here as he was there. For his
[1:37:20] word is the same. Wherever two or three
[1:37:23] are gathered in my name, there I am in
[1:37:25] the midst of them. That's exactly what
[1:37:27] he said. He never changes. He's God the
[1:37:30] word. He never changes. Still giving his
[1:37:33] sheep and feeding them by his shepherd
[1:37:35] prophet. His sheep food first, not to
[1:37:39] theologians, to his sheep.
[1:37:41] I want to say this morning,
[1:37:44] if you have questions and he has the
[1:37:47] answers.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; If you have wise, I I just this is
[1:37:51] what's on my heart. If you have wise and
[1:37:54] you're wondering why, he will take the
[1:37:57] wise away from you.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Well, why shepherds? Why Bethlehem? Why?
[1:38:03] Why a manger?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Why do you keep saying, "Brother
[1:38:07] Brandon, Brother Brandham, Brother
[1:38:08] Brandon?
[1:38:11] Brother Brandon goes on. He said, "He
[1:38:12] commissioned shepherds." He says, "Not
[1:38:14] the wise and trained, but shepherds."
[1:38:16] It's a strange thing, isn't it? But
[1:38:18] there's got to be a why somewhere. There
[1:38:20] is a why. And now there got to be an
[1:38:23] answer why. And no man knows the answer
[1:38:26] save God. He's the one that knows the
[1:38:28] answer. Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And maybe just in turning a little
[1:38:32] corner here as we start to move towards
[1:38:34] a close by the help of God, I I think
[1:38:37] many times we might have questions and
[1:38:39] and we might wonder why and and why do
[1:38:42] things have to be this way or or why has
[1:38:44] it h had to happen this way? And you
[1:38:46] know, ought to say that God knows you've
[1:38:48] had a hard year. God knows you've had a
[1:38:50] hard life. God knows that you've had a
[1:38:52] hard time. And and maybe you're asking
[1:38:54] God, why? Why did this have to happen?
[1:38:56] Why why [screaming] are things this way?
[1:39:00] But you know, it's in the wise that can
[1:39:02] cause a lot of damage.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; I was listening to the life story
[1:39:08] yesterday and brother Brandham was
[1:39:10] talking about
[1:39:11] it's just amazing how he was telling the
[1:39:13] story uh and he goes, you know, I was
[1:39:15] just out there working for for the for
[1:39:17] the the the uh the uh electric company,
[1:39:19] the public company. He said, "I was out
[1:39:21] there, you know, and I climbed up those
[1:39:22] those lines and and I was just singing,
[1:39:25] you know, uh, praising the Lord and I
[1:39:27] and I looked out there and and I saw the
[1:39:29] poles kind of making a a little shadow
[1:39:31] of a cross and reminded me of my savior
[1:39:34] kind of shaking there on the cross and I
[1:39:36] was thinking, "Oh, on a hill far away."
[1:39:37] He said, "Oh, oh, there's that old
[1:39:39] rugged cross, Lord. You you died for me
[1:39:41] on that cross. It was my sins that put
[1:39:44] you there." and he was worshiping God
[1:39:45] and then it caught into his heart and he
[1:39:47] got to thinking about his his wife that
[1:39:49] had passed away and his little girl and
[1:39:51] he said, "You know, I could see maybe
[1:39:53] God taking hope from me." But my little
[1:39:55] Sherry honey, I just couldn't understand
[1:39:58] why would he do something like that. And
[1:40:00] he got to thinking. He started to ask
[1:40:01] God why. Why did this have to happen?
[1:40:04] And he said, "You know what?" He said,
[1:40:05] he got so worked up asking God why.
[1:40:09] He said, "I just can't take it any
[1:40:11] longer." He said, "Sherry, honey, uh,
[1:40:13] daddy's coming to see you." He took off
[1:40:15] them rubber gloves and he laid his hands
[1:40:17] on those electric lights and he fell
[1:40:19] down. He come to himself on the ground
[1:40:22] and he said, "Oh, if it wasn't for a
[1:40:24] predestinated gift in my life, I would
[1:40:26] have been gone a long time ago." Oh,
[1:40:28] hallelujah. I say, "What about you? What
[1:40:31] about you? It's because that
[1:40:32] predestinated gift of God on the inside
[1:40:35] of your life. You'd have walked away
[1:40:36] from the message a long time ago. You
[1:40:38] would have ODed a long time ago. You'd
[1:40:40] be an alcoholic in some insane
[1:40:42] institution, you'd be dead and six feet
[1:40:44] under. Oh, but the grace of God that he
[1:40:46] placed a gift of faith inside of you
[1:40:48] that can say amen to the word. You got
[1:40:51] an ear to ear. And I say if you got an
[1:40:53] ear to hear, you ought to shout. You
[1:40:55] ought to praise God. You ought to thank
[1:40:56] him for the greatest gift that man has
[1:40:58] ever known. The message of the hour,
[1:41:01] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[1:41:03] and forever. He is right here, right
[1:41:05] now. You ain't got [screaming] to ask
[1:41:07] why this and why that. Christ is here.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; He come to himself there and he realized
[1:41:14] I've done lost my mind.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; I've done lost my mind. He goes, I'm
[1:41:19] just going to go home.
[1:41:22] I'm just going to go home. And he he
[1:41:25] tried to commit suicide. And it's
[1:41:27] amazing to me that people,
[1:41:30] you think that you're not predestinated
[1:41:32] and your name's not written on the
[1:41:33] Lamb's Book of Life because you've had
[1:41:35] suicidal thoughts.
[1:41:37] That's a lie from the pits of hell.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; If our own prophet had such a hard time,
[1:41:43] he tried to commit suicide not once but
[1:41:45] twice. It goes to show we go through
[1:41:47] hard times. But it goes to show there's
[1:41:49] a greater power than your own. You can't
[1:41:51] take your own life cuz God is keeping
[1:41:53] you. He's watching out over you. He
[1:41:55] said, "I know my thoughts that I think
[1:41:57] of you." That's a peace not of eel to
[1:42:00] bring you to an expected end. You got an
[1:42:02] expected end, church, because you've
[1:42:04] been bought by deity.
[1:42:06] Oh, I'm feeling pretty good. What a
[1:42:08] Christmas message that Christ is here.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Says he went home and he was he couldn't
[1:42:19] take it anymore. He was staying at his
[1:42:22] mommy there with little Billy and
[1:42:26] he got something in the mail. It was
[1:42:29] Sharon's
[1:42:31] believe she was six months old when the
[1:42:32] Lord took her home.
[1:42:36] He got a little something in the mail,
[1:42:39] a little savings, a count of seven cents
[1:42:41] for his little girl.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't take it anymore."
[1:42:46] He starts to say how somehow he went
[1:42:48] into a vision. He went on somewhere and
[1:42:52] he was walking down some road and down
[1:42:54] some trail and and there was a little
[1:42:56] wagon schooner there and it had a broken
[1:42:58] wheel there and he said, "That
[1:43:00] represents my family. It won't run
[1:43:02] anymore." And he was there walking and
[1:43:04] all of a sudden this beautiful little
[1:43:07] girl, beautiful girl said, "Hi, daddy."
[1:43:10] He said, "Hello. Hello. How you doing?"
[1:43:12] He said, "It's me, Sharon. You?" He
[1:43:15] said, "You're you you know known me on
[1:43:16] earth as your as your little Sherry." He
[1:43:19] said, "But he said, we're all grown
[1:43:21] here." He said, "Sherry, that's you." He
[1:43:25] said, "Yeah, I'm going to wait here for
[1:43:26] Billy. You go on up. Mom's mom's
[1:43:28] looking. Mom's waiting for you up at the
[1:43:31] house." And he said he ran just as hard
[1:43:33] as he could go and he got up there and
[1:43:35] there was hope. He said with her long
[1:43:37] hair hanging down and her gown, he said,
[1:43:39] "Oh, I missed you. I've I missed you so
[1:43:42] bad. Me and me and Billy are so lonely."
[1:43:45] And he she said, "Oh, don't worry,
[1:43:46] Billy.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; We're better here than we were there.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Please don't worry anymore." He looked
[1:43:53] around. He found that old chair that he
[1:43:56] had worked and saved up and and little
[1:43:58] and Hope was trying to save money so
[1:43:59] they wouldn't uh take his own own chair.
[1:44:02] And and Hope said, "This is your house.
[1:44:04] This is your chair." And brother Brand
[1:44:06] said, "Oh, Brandhams don't have homes.
[1:44:09] We we we're vandabons." He goes, "Oh,
[1:44:11] but here you do, honey. This is your
[1:44:13] home."
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And you see what I feel in my heart God
[1:44:19] was doing is hearing this. Why? Why was
[1:44:23] tormenting him and God took him
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; in another place? He took him beyond the
[1:44:29] curtain of time. God was taking his
[1:44:32] prophet. He wasn't just doing that for
[1:44:34] the prophet. He was doing it for you.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; He was doing it for you. You might have
[1:44:38] lost a family member. You might have
[1:44:40] lost a loved one. They might their lives
[1:44:42] might have been taken in such a tragic
[1:44:45] way. And that why can eat at you and rob
[1:44:48] you of your joy and rob you of your
[1:44:50] peace. Oh, [screaming] but God has sent
[1:44:52] you a message to take you beyond the
[1:44:54] curtain of time to let you know
[1:44:55] everything that you love and everything
[1:44:57] that you hold dear, it's going to be
[1:44:59] there. Don't you worry anymore. You
[1:45:02] don't have to worry. You don't have to
[1:45:04] wonder why. What does this message do?
[1:45:06] It takes the why away. And it gives you
[1:45:08] a faith to believe that all things are
[1:45:11] possible.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; What a message. What a Christmas.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:45:18] [applause]
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; As we close out another year,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; I pray God would take away the wise,
[1:45:28] take the wise away from us.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; They'll get you so worked up,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; get you all frustrated.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Why did this happen? Why did that
[1:45:43] happen? But Jesus said in Matthew 11:28,
[1:45:45] he said, "Come unto me all ye that are
[1:45:46] heavy laden,
[1:45:49] all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
[1:45:50] and I will give you rest.
[1:45:54] Take my yoke upon you. Alert of me, for
[1:45:58] I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
[1:46:01] shall find rest unto your souls. For my
[1:46:04] yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
[1:46:07] No more worry,
[1:46:10] no more wondering.
[1:46:12] I know some hard things have happened in
[1:46:15] your past.
[1:46:17] Scars, hurt,
[1:46:19] home life situations,
[1:46:22] but God has sent a message
[1:46:25] to let you know everything's going to be
[1:46:27] okay.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. I I know I know
[1:46:30] it's hard. I know there's trouble
[1:46:33] everywhere. How how can how can you live
[1:46:36] a overcoming life in Satan's Eden? How
[1:46:38] how can you young men over overcome all
[1:46:40] the strip teases and the modern trends
[1:46:43] of the day? And and how can you possess
[1:46:45] your vessel in sanctification and honor?
[1:46:47] And how can girls carry themselves in
[1:46:49] holiness and bodice and following the
[1:46:53] commandments of the Lord given through a
[1:46:54] vindicated prophet uh to declare that he
[1:46:57] is not dead but he is alive and he is
[1:46:59] living in a people. H how can you do
[1:47:01] him? Oh, brother Matthew, there's so
[1:47:02] much trouble. There's so much
[1:47:03] wickedness. Oh yes, but we have heard a
[1:47:06] message. We have heard a shout,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; the Lord descending. And what did he say
[1:47:12] in Psalms 27:5? He said, "In the time of
[1:47:15] trouble, he shall hide me in his
[1:47:17] pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:47:19] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:47:22] set me up upon a rock." Oh, glory to
[1:47:25] God. We have a revelation that the
[1:47:27] message of the hour is none other than
[1:47:30] Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today,
[1:47:32] and forever. Don't let the test, don't
[1:47:34] let the trial try to make you question
[1:47:36] your calling and your position in
[1:47:38] Christ.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; The scripture says our trials are worth
[1:47:43] more precious than gold. The prophet of
[1:47:45] God said it's a testing time. It's one
[1:47:48] good evidence to us that God is with us
[1:47:50] when we're tested. For all children of
[1:47:53] God are tested and tried.
[1:47:58] I say then if God can take the wise away
[1:48:00] from us.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Some of us struggle over and over with
[1:48:05] the question if you have the baptism of
[1:48:07] the Holy Ghost or not. And you keep
[1:48:10] looking for some some type of evidence.
[1:48:13] I want to tell you the evidence is do
[1:48:15] you believe? And I and I'm not pointing
[1:48:17] to some false teaching out there that
[1:48:19] has come into the message where if you
[1:48:21] just say I believe it, I got it. know
[1:48:23] I'm what I'm trying to say. It's beyond
[1:48:25] your senses. It's beyond your emotion.
[1:48:27] If something in your heart believes that
[1:48:29] the word of God is true and in obedience
[1:48:31] to that word, you've went to a watery
[1:48:33] grave. God has given you a promise. If
[1:48:35] you repent of your sins and you're
[1:48:37] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:38] Christ, you shall receive the gift of
[1:48:40] the Holy Ghost. And God is not a man
[1:48:43] that he should lie. Then you should
[1:48:44] stand upon that promised word. And every
[1:48:46] time that devil comes lying to you, say,
[1:48:48] "Devil, back up in the name of the Lord,
[1:48:50] I got a divine promise. I had repented
[1:48:53] of my sins and I got a promise. Whether
[1:48:55] I got it yesterday, whether I got it
[1:48:57] today, whether I get it tomorrow, I got
[1:49:00] it because I am of the faith seat of
[1:49:02] Abraham. And the promise is just as good
[1:49:04] as the manifestation. Oh, I'm feeling
[1:49:07] pretty good because I'm going in a
[1:49:09] rapture. I am going [screaming] in a
[1:49:11] body chase because I have heard from my
[1:49:14] theophony. I have heard the [screaming]
[1:49:16] message of the hour. Come up higher,
[1:49:18] John. Come up higher. We have been set
[1:49:21] up upon the rock of revelation.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise his wonderful name.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; I say it's time to move into our
[1:49:33] position and our calling.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I could stay there a while, but I'm
[1:49:37] running out of time.
[1:49:39] I was fellowship by brother David about
[1:49:41] Hebrews first five chapters of Hebrews
[1:49:45] uh showing Paul's laying out there
[1:49:48] Christ and and and laying out the law uh
[1:49:51] through Moses and and showing how that
[1:49:54] they received the word but it wasn't
[1:49:55] mixed with faith and it didn't profited
[1:49:57] them anything.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And he comes and tells the people y'all
[1:50:01] y'all should y'all should be teachers
[1:50:05] but you you need milk.
[1:50:08] It's amazing to me we have people who
[1:50:10] believe this message and are getting
[1:50:11] married and still dancing like the
[1:50:13] world,
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; still wearing makeup.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I'll go ahead and say it. Your wedding
[1:50:18] should be your opportunity to declare to
[1:50:20] the world that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:50:22] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; That is, sisters, that is one of your
[1:50:25] greatest platforms
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; to declare the message of the hour.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "You want
[1:50:32] to see what somebody's made of? Let the
[1:50:34] pressure come." And they give into
[1:50:36] culture.
[1:50:38] They give into movements.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; They're influenced by Instagram
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; on how they should represent the message
[1:50:45] of the hour. I got to be out by a creek.
[1:50:48] I got to be on a pond. It got to be
[1:50:50] these big trees.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; That's not how my Lord came.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; And you deserve something better than my
[1:50:57] Lord. Look, I ain't trying to tell you
[1:50:59] not to have a nice wedding, but what I'm
[1:51:01] telling you, don't put the world first.
[1:51:03] Put Christ first. Put the message of the
[1:51:05] hour first. Wear your hair, Lord. Get
[1:51:08] those makeup off of you. Wear your
[1:51:10] glory.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; This dancing and modern trend of them
[1:51:14] heathenistic rituals.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Shame on us.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; When you ought to be teachers, you need
[1:51:20] milk.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Pastor has to come up and tell us what
[1:51:26] the Holy Ghost would look like in a
[1:51:28] believer's life when you should have the
[1:51:29] Holy Ghost declaring what it looks like
[1:51:31] in your life.
[1:51:34] You can look at me crosseyed all you
[1:51:36] want, but I know where I'm standing and
[1:51:38] I know whom I believe in and I am
[1:51:40] persuaded. Search the scriptures in them
[1:51:43] you think you have eternal life and they
[1:51:45] are they that testify of me.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; He is not dead. [screaming] He is alive.
[1:51:50] Living in you, living in you, living in
[1:51:52] you.
[1:52:02] Oh, but he goes he lays all that down
[1:52:04] and says, "When you ought to be
[1:52:06] teachers, you need milk."
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; But oh, he turns over into chapter six.
[1:52:13] He says, "But let us go on into
[1:52:15] perfection."
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "Strong meat belongs unto them
[1:52:20] that are of full age."
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't belong unto the
[1:52:26] Methodist.
[1:52:27] and the restoration of gifts. And
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; but strong meat belongs to my friends,
[1:52:34] to the bride who can grow up in the
[1:52:37] restoration of what God was building
[1:52:39] back. And then when he comes and says,
[1:52:41] "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:52:43] blood, oh Lord Jesus Christ, will you go
[1:52:46] also?" Where else would we go? Thou hast
[1:52:48] the words of eternal life. When people
[1:52:50] are running away from this message and
[1:52:52] they're letting down their standards and
[1:52:54] they're letting the world coming in and
[1:52:55] they're drifting in their music and
[1:52:57] their modesty and their dress and in
[1:52:58] their weddings and their music, I want
[1:53:00] to tell you there is a bornag again
[1:53:02] bride of Jesus Christ who's been
[1:53:03] baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:05] and they will hold the standard of the
[1:53:07] world high and high and lifted up. If
[1:53:10] you lift Jesus Christ up, I will
[1:53:12] [screaming] draw all men underneath.
[1:53:14] Where is he? He is in you. He is in his
[1:53:17] bride. [screaming]
[1:53:21] Your wedding might be the very thing
[1:53:23] that calls the last one in
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; or sends the last one out. I don't know.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Well, we're here. I'm sorry. I even got
[1:53:32] a wedding coming up. Praise God. The
[1:53:34] Lord knows what we have need of.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that because I here recently
[1:53:38] I was at a wedding
[1:53:41] and I won't go into it. But one thing I
[1:53:43] know, I know what the word of God
[1:53:45] produces.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know them by their fruits,
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; not their gifts. I don't care how loud
[1:53:53] you jump, scream, talk in tongues, how
[1:53:55] much you prophesy, how much you can do
[1:53:57] back flips, and run across the tops of
[1:53:58] the pews. I want to tell you, you know
[1:54:00] them by their fruits.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:54:05] gentleness, kindness, brotherly
[1:54:07] kindness, all those things. Just a few
[1:54:10] more minutes as we work towards a close.
[1:54:13] Prophet of God said just speaking on
[1:54:16] this this this quote struck out to me.
[1:54:18] Y'all doing okay? We feeling all right?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; We we got no uh evening service. So we
[1:54:25] just take our time here working towards
[1:54:27] a close, but it won't be too long. But
[1:54:29] it's just speaking about this moving
[1:54:30] into our perfection. We we ought to be a
[1:54:32] full age.
[1:54:35] Our lives ought to be teaching and
[1:54:36] instructing others
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; when when when we we see we're lacking
[1:54:41] and we still need the sincere milk of
[1:54:43] the word to teach us as babies when we
[1:54:46] should be so much further down the road.
[1:54:48] This bride is a mature lady.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; She's been impregnated with the word.
[1:54:52] She's coming in invisible union. We're
[1:54:54] right there on the thresh of stepping
[1:54:56] over into the change of our bodies. And
[1:54:58] you're trying to tell me we're over here
[1:55:00] uh uh uh uh uh with well why you know
[1:55:03] why can't we listen to that and why
[1:55:04] can't we listen to this and you know I
[1:55:06] think it'll be okay and it's just one
[1:55:08] time it's just it's just for this it's
[1:55:10] just for that.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; No I I don't I I never found anywhere in
[1:55:14] the Bible or in the message where the
[1:55:15] Holy Ghost was wishy-washy.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost ain't the Holy Ghost six
[1:55:20] days a week and on the seventh day. It
[1:55:21] ain't the Holy Ghost 364 days a year.
[1:55:23] No, it the Holy Ghost 247. Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; And if we ain't lining up, we just need
[1:55:28] a good old repentance.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this in talking
[1:55:32] about moving into our position and
[1:55:34] calling
[1:55:36] about 101 15 more minutes.
[1:55:39] This is and God doesn't call a man to
[1:55:40] judge him without first warning him.
[1:55:43] He says, "If you went to work for a man
[1:55:46] and he gave you a job on a ranch or
[1:55:48] something or another and you just went
[1:55:50] out to the barn and just sat down out
[1:55:53] there and say, "Well,
[1:55:56] see, you must go ask him what he wants
[1:56:00] you to do and then do it." If you're
[1:56:04] working for a man, find out what your
[1:56:06] duties is. And then if you're if our
[1:56:09] life on this earth here, then we should
[1:56:13] go to the one who put us here.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I don't have to ask where do
[1:56:19] I go?
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Do I go to this church or to that
[1:56:24] church?
[1:56:27] Put us here and say, Lord, what would
[1:56:29] you have me to do? What must I do? Why
[1:56:33] am I here?
[1:56:37] If it's to be a housewife, dishwasher,
[1:56:39] whatever God wants you to do, then you
[1:56:42] do the very best that you know how to do
[1:56:45] it.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; No matter how little,
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; no matter how little it is, you must do
[1:56:53] it.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; You wonder why people are acting the way
[1:56:57] that they're doing. You wonder why they
[1:56:59] they do these things. You wonder why it
[1:57:02] lacks the sanctity,
[1:57:05] the holiness, and the character.
[1:57:08] Is there not hearing with understanding?
[1:57:12] Brother Brandham shows us the
[1:57:13] difference. He that heareth my words,
[1:57:16] not just hear intellectually because he
[1:57:19] gives the parable. He gives the type
[1:57:20] says you can go out there and the
[1:57:22] drunkard be in the same service and say,
[1:57:23] "Hey, did you hear the preacher?" And he
[1:57:25] say, "Yeah, I heard him." But there's no
[1:57:27] understanding to do what the word said
[1:57:29] to do. And I say a lot of us are hearing
[1:57:31] but where is the understanding? Because
[1:57:34] the understanding will be reflected in
[1:57:36] your character.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; That that's that's why we see the things
[1:57:48] that we see in people's lives is because
[1:57:50] they need a greater revelation. John
[1:57:53] 14:15, Jesus said, "If you love me, keep
[1:57:55] my commandments."
[1:57:57] Why do we see transgressing? Why why do
[1:57:59] we think there's a lack of revelation?
[1:58:00] There's a lack of love. John 10:27, he
[1:58:03] said, "My sheep hear my voice and I know
[1:58:04] them and they follow me and I give unto
[1:58:06] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:58:08] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:58:10] out of my hand."
[1:58:13] Just moving now towards the end, he's
[1:58:15] just in this message why it had to be
[1:58:18] shepherds.
[1:58:19] How how he bypassed the uneduca,
[1:58:23] bypassed the educated. And here he's
[1:58:25] using these uh uh uh uh uh shepherds.
[1:58:29] They they they smelt bad and they they
[1:58:31] they they looked they looked bad and
[1:58:33] they they hung out with all the sheep.
[1:58:35] But the prophet of God is pointing out
[1:58:37] something. He says all they needed to do
[1:58:39] was to know the sheep. And he's starting
[1:58:41] to show a great parallel here about our
[1:58:43] great shepherd. And this is where we'll
[1:58:45] we'll move along these lines to a close
[1:58:47] because Jesus said, "I am the good
[1:58:49] shepherd and the good shepherd giveth
[1:58:51] his life for the sheep." And brother Ben
[1:58:54] says this. He says, "And the great
[1:58:55] prophet shepherd, Jesus did it himself.
[1:58:58] I laid down my life. No man takes it
[1:59:00] from me. He was the great shepherd. The
[1:59:02] great prophet shepherd. No man takes it
[1:59:04] from me. I do it myself." Notice it
[1:59:06] didn't gradually come. It come in a
[1:59:08] minute. The great shepherd himself took
[1:59:10] our guilt and smoked himself. Took our
[1:59:12] sins and laid it upon himself. No
[1:59:14] wonder, the poet wrote, "Mid rendering
[1:59:16] rocks and darkening skies, my savior
[1:59:18] bowed his head and died. The opening
[1:59:20] veil revealed the way to heaven's joys
[1:59:22] and endless day. He said that secret had
[1:59:25] been in God's bosom all these years,
[1:59:27] covered by his right hand. Jesus, the
[1:59:29] great shepherd, took it upon himself our
[1:59:32] guilt for us.
[1:59:35] The scripture says in Isaiah 53:5, we're
[1:59:39] talking about Christmas,
[1:59:41] but he was wounded for our
[1:59:43] transgression. He was bruised for our
[1:59:45] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:59:48] peace was upon him, and with his stripes
[1:59:51] we are healed. All we like sheep have
[1:59:54] gone astray. We have turned everyone to
[1:59:56] his own way. And the Lord hath laid on
[1:59:59] him the iniquity
[2:00:02] of us all.
[2:00:05] There ought to be such a thanksgiving
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; to think that all of our sins and bad
[2:00:13] living and every bad decision that we've
[2:00:16] ever made and the ones you're going to
[2:00:18] make, it was all laid upon Christ. And
[2:00:23] to think the very word came and was born
[2:00:26] and laid in a manger wrapped in
[2:00:28] swaddling clothes, it looked so
[2:00:31] insignificant.
[2:00:33] How could any good thing come out of
[2:00:35] Nazareth? And yet it was exactly what
[2:00:38] the word said it was. I asked you, what
[2:00:40] about the message of the hour? Oh, it's
[2:00:43] not popular. It didn't come to the
[2:00:45] theologians. Oh, but it bypassed down to
[2:00:48] what would be called an illiterate,
[2:00:50] uneducated man by the name of William
[2:00:52] Brandham. But God gave him a message.
[2:00:54] And what is that message? It's a message
[2:00:55] of deliverance. is to take us in an
[2:00:57] exodus out of this uh terrible dark and
[2:01:00] dreadful world into a body change and
[2:01:02] into a rapture. And I'll just close
[2:01:04] reading this out of the book. Oh, just
[2:01:06] speak just thinking about the
[2:01:08] iniquities, all of our iniquities been
[2:01:10] laid upon them all. Brother Brandham
[2:01:12] says this. He says, "The believers whose
[2:01:14] names were written in the book of life,
[2:01:16] predestinated from the foundation of the
[2:01:18] world, it was finished that very minute
[2:01:21] that Jesus said it was finished. He,
[2:01:23] that great shepherd, had come for his
[2:01:24] sheep. It was finished. God's right hand
[2:01:27] was pulled from his bosom, smitten. Then
[2:01:29] on Easter, he returned it. Amen. Raised
[2:01:31] up again uh raised up again to his bosom
[2:01:35] and extended it down to you and I in the
[2:01:37] form of his word to redeem us back to
[2:01:39] the original garden from which sin took
[2:01:42] us from.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the prophet. Help me out.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll take my time. We'll start
[2:01:49] over. The believers whose names were
[2:01:51] written in the book of life
[2:01:54] predestinated from the foundation of the
[2:01:56] world. It was finished that very minute
[2:01:59] that Jesus said it was finished.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; He that great shepherd had come for his
[2:02:06] sheep.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; It was finished.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; God's right hand was pulled from his
[2:02:11] bosom, smitten. Then on Easter, he
[2:02:13] returned it. Amen. raised up again to
[2:02:16] his bosom and extended it down to you
[2:02:18] and I in the form of his word to redeem
[2:02:20] us back to the original garden from
[2:02:22] which sin took us from. Oh, to think we
[2:02:25] have received a message that's taken us
[2:02:27] back to a garden of Eden condition
[2:02:29] before sin was even ever conceived.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Now we're in the three-fold mystery
[2:02:36] purpose of Christ. Christ the mystery of
[2:02:38] God revealed what? Christ revealing
[2:02:41] himself. Christ having the preeminence
[2:02:44] in his bride. And what was the third
[2:02:45] three-fold? To take us back to an Eden
[2:02:47] condition.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; He said the hidden secret of his great
[2:02:51] heart was revealed by a prophet
[2:02:54] shepherd. It was revealed by a shepherd.
[2:02:56] Prophet shepherd. No wonder the
[2:02:58] mountains jumped and shouted on that
[2:03:00] day. No wonder the sun hid its face and
[2:03:02] screamed for joy. No wonder
[2:03:06] all the all nature broke loose. The wind
[2:03:08] shook the trees until they shook and
[2:03:10] shook and joy and jumped. They seen the
[2:03:13] prophet shepherd on the mountain
[2:03:15] redeemed every name on the book of life.
[2:03:18] Oh, you're redeemed this morning.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And they seen that their own nature was
[2:03:23] redeemed. They screamed and jumped and
[2:03:26] the world went into an earthquake and
[2:03:28] the mountains rent and the rocks fell
[2:03:30] out and the sun went down and everything
[2:03:33] taken place. Like any meeting, when the
[2:03:36] shepherd reveals to you, it's finished.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I pray that the
[2:03:43] revelation would strike somebody this
[2:03:45] morning. It take away the wise. Why did
[2:03:48] this have to happen? Why did that have
[2:03:49] to happen? Maybe I'm not the bride. If I
[2:03:51] was the bride, why? I wouldn't have come
[2:03:53] this way. My family wouldn't be like
[2:03:54] this. I wouldn't have a broken home. Why
[2:03:56] this? But I want to tell you, if you
[2:03:58] ever catch a revelation that the message
[2:04:01] has been sent to you, behold, I send you
[2:04:04] Elijah. Oh, I pray that you would open
[2:04:06] up your heart and by faith say, I
[2:04:08] believe it. It is finished. There is
[2:04:10] therefore now no condemnation to them
[2:04:12] that are in Christ Jesus. Blessed is the
[2:04:14] man whom the Lord will not impute sin.
[2:04:17] If God before us, who can be against us,
[2:04:20] oh, praise the Lord, it is finished. You
[2:04:23] don't have to worry. You don't have to
[2:04:24] ask why. You just have to say, "I am the
[2:04:27] pride of Jesus Christ. My neighbors
[2:04:29] reink on the lamb's book of life before
[2:04:31] the foundation of the world. So, I am
[2:04:33] going in a rapture. Boo, devil, get out
[2:04:35] of my way. Every promise in the book is
[2:04:38] mine. I'm going in a rapture. I'm going
[2:04:40] to get my healing. I'm going to get my
[2:04:42] family. I'm going to get my kids. I'm
[2:04:44] going to get everything that God has
[2:04:46] ever promised me because it is
[2:04:49] finished." Hallelujah.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've seen jumping spells and
[2:04:54] joy spells, but there was nobody hurt.
[2:04:56] The mountains rung down, the sun went
[2:04:58] down, and everything took place, but
[2:05:00] there was nobody hurt. And I've seen
[2:05:02] meetings where the power of God was
[2:05:04] revealed to the people that they were
[2:05:06] free from the world and the things of
[2:05:08] the world."
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; And the joy of the Lord filled the
[2:05:15] congregation.
[2:05:18] They stood and screamed and cried and
[2:05:21] shouted to the top of their [screaming]
[2:05:24] voice for the glory of God. I never did
[2:05:27] see anything disorderly. They was always
[2:05:30] right in order
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; because
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; their friends were doing it
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; because it was the popular thing to do.
[2:05:41] because I wanted to fit in with the
[2:05:43] youth group. Because I wanted the people
[2:05:45] to think that I I had a revelation of
[2:05:47] the message.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; No, you can do that, but you'll go right
[2:05:51] back to loose living. You'll go back to
[2:05:54] your country music. You'll go back to
[2:05:56] your Instagram. You'll go back to your
[2:05:58] old friends. You'll go back to all those
[2:06:00] things. But I ain't mad if you try. Give
[2:06:02] it a try. And if you find out it don't
[2:06:04] hold on, you need to get it for real.
[2:06:09] I never did see anything disorderly.
[2:06:11] They was always right in order because
[2:06:13] they had recognized that their name had
[2:06:16] been written on the lamb's book of life
[2:06:18] before the foundation of the world. The
[2:06:20] great prophet shepherd had brought them
[2:06:23] the message and they were delivered.
[2:06:26] Hallelujah. Christ has sent me a message
[2:06:29] by divine promise according to Malachi
[2:06:32] 4:5. And I am free. I am delivered.
[2:06:35] That's why I shout. That's why I scream.
[2:06:37] There ain't no drug. There ain't no
[2:06:39] religion. There ain't no alcohol. There
[2:06:41] ain't nothing that got a hold on me. I'm
[2:06:43] free. I'm delivered. That's why I shout.
[2:06:46] That's why I scream. That's why I have a
[2:06:48] good time. I never did see anything that
[2:06:50] was disorderly because I got a
[2:06:52] revelation that my name is written on
[2:06:55] the Lamb's book of life. Boo, devil,
[2:06:57] back up. I'm free. It is finished.
[2:07:02] I say, "Why don't the love of God fill
[2:07:03] the congregation? Give them praise. Give
[2:07:06] them honor if the musicians would come."
[2:07:09] [applause]
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; I say, "We ought to appreciate the
[2:07:13] message of the hour. [applause]
[2:07:20] [cheering]
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is finished.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Have you seen that your name is written
[2:07:27] on the Lamb's book of life?"
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:32] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; I don't need no morphine shot.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; I don't need no pills.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; I don't need no AA.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; I don't need no counseling because I've
[2:07:45] already had a conference.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What we need this
[2:07:52] morning is a conference with God on the
[2:07:54] back side of the desert in the presence
[2:07:56] of the pillar of fire, that burning
[2:07:58] bush. And that's what the message came
[2:08:00] to declare to you. Christ is risen.
[2:08:03] Christ is here.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you praise God? Why don't
[2:08:09] you tell him you love him? Why don't you
[2:08:10] show your appreciation
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; for his greatest gift?
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Say, why don't you tell him you love
[2:08:17] him? Why don't you talk to him for a
[2:08:19] moment?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Why don't you rejoice? Why don't you
[2:08:21] praise God?
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Well, go ahead a little bit.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I think it's all right to
[2:08:29] tell them, "Thank you, Lord Jesus."
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've gotten excited about
[2:08:32] Christmas gifts. I've got excited about
[2:08:35] uh uh things. But oh, God, one thing I
[2:08:37] want to get excited about is the message
[2:08:39] of the hour.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; I was made for more.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, tell me this.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; If you hold your voice,
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; the rocks will cry out.
[2:08:57] But ain't no rock going to take my
[2:08:59] place. [music]
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't no tree going to take my place.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show my appreciation.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to cry out and say, "It is
[2:09:12] finished."
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Why is it finished?
[2:09:16] Cuz Jesus Christ paid your ransom.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; But as we sing the song, oh the thought
[2:09:22] that was on my heart,
[2:09:24] take the wise away.
[2:09:27] You were made for more.
[2:09:30] You were made to manifest the message of
[2:09:32] the hour.
[2:09:36] I know who I am. [singing]
[2:09:39] [music]
[2:09:41] Cuz I know who you are.
[2:09:46] The cross of [music and singing]
[2:09:48] salvation. ation
[2:09:52] was only
[2:09:54] [music]
[2:09:59] chosen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; for [singing] free and
[2:10:09] I [music] have a future
[2:10:14] and it's worth living.
[2:10:18] Oh,
[2:10:21] you know who I [music and singing] am
[2:10:26] cuz I know who you are. [music]
[2:10:32] The cross of salvation
[2:10:36] always
[2:10:39] [music and singing]
[2:10:43] now I am chosen.
[2:10:47] [music]
[2:10:48] Oh free and forg.
[2:10:54] I have [music] a future
[2:10:59] and it is worth [music]
[2:11:01] the living. Why?
[2:11:04] Oh,
[2:11:05] [music and singing] I was
[2:11:08] taking away.
[2:11:14] [music]
[2:11:19] [music]
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; So why would I
[2:11:31] shame without
[2:11:34] [music]
[2:11:35] my [singing] way?
[2:11:40] I was faithful. [music]
[2:11:46] I know I [music] am
[2:11:51] cuz I know who you are. [music]
[2:11:56] You cross the sales.
[2:12:01] [music and singing]
[2:12:08] [music and singing]
[2:12:16] [music]
[2:12:18] I am a future.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; is worth
[2:12:29] [music]
[2:12:31] [singing]
[2:12:36] my
[2:12:38] [singing]
[2:12:39] [music]
[2:12:43] [singing]
[2:12:48] [music]
[2:12:54] my sh [music]
[2:12:56] [singing]
[2:12:59] my way. I know I am.
[2:13:04] I [music and singing] was faithful.
[2:13:10] Brother Brandham starts to close out his
[2:13:13] message and he says, "Now, if you've
[2:13:14] been listening to something, [music]
[2:13:17] another's pulled you away from the real
[2:13:19] true shepherd that'll lead you to the
[2:13:22] word, the Holy Spirit.
[2:13:25] You do not have the experience and you
[2:13:28] do not have the witness of the Holy
[2:13:30] Spirit in your life.
[2:13:33] God is one. God is the only one that has
[2:13:36] eternal life
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; and he is eternal life." Amen.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; And anything that had a beginning has an
[2:13:42] end.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; And if you're just a member of a church,
[2:13:47] it had a beginning.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; You're born of the word, then you become
[2:13:52] a son of God. And your name was put on
[2:13:55] the lamb's book of life before the
[2:13:57] foundation of the world. [music]
[2:13:59] And you, the color of your hair that you
[2:14:01] have, the color of your eyes, you have,
[2:14:04] the stature that you're in. [music]
[2:14:07] Oh, see sometimes we ask why. Why me?
[2:14:10] Why this? Why do I look like that? Why
[2:14:13] is my nose so big?
[2:14:17] Those wise wishing things were
[2:14:19] different.
[2:14:21] But look what the prophet's letting you
[2:14:22] know. Oh, I say the message takes away
[2:14:25] the wise and it gives a faith
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; because what my heart's desire is to
[2:14:30] show is that we have questions and not
[2:14:33] all your questions are going to be
[2:14:34] answered.
[2:14:36] Job could have had a lot of questions,
[2:14:38] but one thing he received was a
[2:14:39] revelation.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; He no longer had to wonder why. He just
[2:14:42] said, "I know that my redeemer liveth.
[2:14:44] The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh
[2:14:47] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[2:14:49] Oh, it took away the lies. I say, "Oh
[2:14:51] God, my heart's desire this morning is
[2:14:54] God takes away the lies and gives
[2:14:56] revelation."
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "God seen you before the
[2:15:02] foundation of the world, and he's seen
[2:15:03] you a human being like you are.
[2:15:06] And though there come a million years
[2:15:09] yet,
[2:15:11] there's nothing can keep you
[2:15:14] from coming back to that [music] perfect
[2:15:17] image
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; that God ordained for you
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; in the beginning." Hallelujah.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; How do you know? My sheep
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; hear my voice.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; And a stranger
[2:15:32] they will not follow.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. There's
[2:15:38] nothing that can [music] stop it. Well,
[2:15:40] some glad [singing] morning. Wow.

[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; I watch
[2:18:57] I will shout
[2:19:00] and I will sing praise the [music] Lord
[2:19:03] with [singing]
[2:19:05] my I am thinking we are high on the
[2:19:13] [music] holy Heat.
[2:19:16] Heat.
[2:19:24] [music]
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Heat.
[2:19:45] [music]
[2:19:48] Heat.
[2:19:52] Yeah. [music]
[2:19:59] Heat. [music]
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Heat.
[2:20:19] Heat.
[2:20:21] [music]
[2:20:29] [music] Let's
[2:20:35] [music]
[2:20:41] think of it.
[2:20:44] Amen.
[2:20:46] The angels [music]
[2:20:47] will
[2:20:51] hallelujah. [music]
[2:20:58] Heat. Heat.
[2:21:02] [music]
[2:21:07] [music]
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:21:15] [music]
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I I think that's just
[2:21:21] what we needed to end the years. A good
[2:21:24] evangelistic message
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; to get our minds back on the things that
[2:21:30] matter. [music]
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? This is a this is
[2:21:35] a the hour of salvation. Right.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; I I thought as I [music] as Matthew was
[2:21:42] preaching, I went back to what I
[2:21:44] mentioned in the second chapter. Hannah
[2:21:46] says this. She says, "And Hannah prayed
[2:21:49] and said, my heart rejoicth in the Lord.
[2:21:54] My horn is exalted
[2:21:57] in the Lord. [music]
[2:21:59] My mouth is enlarged over my enemies
[2:22:03] because I rejoice in thy salvation.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And and then she goes on, there
[2:22:14] is none holy as the [music] Lord.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; There is none besides thee, neither is
[2:22:20] there any rock like our God.
[2:22:24] Talk no more [music] so exceedingly
[2:22:27] proudly. Let not arrogance come out of
[2:22:31] your mouth. For the Lord is a God of
[2:22:34] knowledge, [music] and by him actions
[2:22:38] are weighed.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [music] This is a a a woman
[2:22:46] praying
[2:22:47] to the Lord. Listen to that great
[2:22:50] [music]
[2:22:50] knowledge and wisdom. The bows of the
[2:22:53] mighty men are broken, and they that
[2:22:57] stumble [music]
[2:22:58] are girded with strength.
[2:23:02] [music]
[2:23:03] They that were full have hired out
[2:23:07] themselves for bread, and they that were
[2:23:11] hungry seized. So the barren hath borne
[2:23:16] seven, and she hath had many children,
[2:23:19] [music] is wax feeble. The Lord kleth
[2:23:22] and maketh alive. He bringeth down
[2:23:26] [music] the grave and bringeth up. The
[2:23:28] Lord maketh poor and maketh rich. He
[2:23:33] bringeth [music] low and he lifted up
[2:23:36] high. He raised up the poor out of the
[2:23:39] dust and lifteth up the beggar from the
[2:23:43] [music] dungill to set them among
[2:23:45] princes and to make them inherit the
[2:23:48] throne of glory. [music] For the pillars
[2:23:51] of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath
[2:23:55] sent the world upon them. That's your
[2:23:59] God. He liftth you up. [music]
[2:24:02] He's mindful of you.
[2:24:05] You know, when your heart's stirred up
[2:24:09] and you [music] and the word of God
[2:24:11] comes, it it's it's there to cut the
[2:24:13] things that are ungodly
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; out of our lives.
[2:24:19] And if it it's not
[2:24:22] given just so that
[2:24:25] we can repent.
[2:24:28] Repentance is
[2:24:30] necessary [music] and good. But it's
[2:24:33] that you can get into a relationship
[2:24:35] with the Lord
[2:24:37] and you can start walking daily with him
[2:24:40] on your hearts and him on your minds
[2:24:45] knowing that this is not our home
[2:24:50] and that you can become mindful of every
[2:24:54] action for the Lord weighth your actions
[2:24:59] and it becomes a consciousness. [music]
[2:25:02] a Christian consciousness.
[2:25:05] And [music] that's what Christianity is,
[2:25:08] is let this mind
[2:25:10] be in you that was [music] in Christ
[2:25:13] Jesus.
[2:25:15] We only have one service today. Our next
[2:25:17] service is New Year's Eve
[2:25:21] and it's good at I believe it's starting
[2:25:25] about 7:00
[2:25:27] 7:30. We'll have fellowship in the
[2:25:30] fellowship hall. We'll have food and and
[2:25:36] fellowship and then we'll come over for
[2:25:39] service
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; uh starting around 9:30 10:00. Then
[2:25:45] we'll have communion. But take this
[2:25:48] morning
[2:25:50] the things that were said
[2:25:54] and weigh them in your heart
[2:25:57] and ask yourself,
[2:25:59] what thing should I [music]
[2:26:01] apply the token to
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; and what things should I enlarge
[2:26:11] without condemnation
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; because the price has been paid. you can
[2:26:16] go forward and be more Christlike.
[2:26:21] I saw these little family on the front
[2:26:24] pew here and I thought they're some of
[2:26:26] the nicest behaved children I've ever
[2:26:29] seen that you might not think so but but
[2:26:32] they really did wonderful. I I was
[2:26:35] really impressed. [music] I wanted to
[2:26:37] say that to you. God bless you. It's a
[2:26:39] hard place to sit and they did really
[2:26:42] wonderful.
[2:26:44] Don't miss the part of the message too
[2:26:46] about loving one another,
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; having no respect of persons
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; and letting the love of God be shed
[2:26:53] abroad in your [music] heart by the Holy
[2:26:56] Spirit.
[2:26:58] Let's be real reflectors [music]
[2:27:00] of the message we have. I I believe that
[2:27:03] was a strong theme [music] this morning.
[2:27:06] What does your life reflect?
[2:27:09] Who are you identified with? Who what
[2:27:13] light does your light shine on?
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; And here we've got the greatest message.
[2:27:21] [music]
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; And we ought to live and give oursel to
[2:27:23] it.
[2:27:25] As Hannah in this scripture, you know
[2:27:28] the story of Hannah. [music]
[2:27:29] She didn't bring her son to the temple
[2:27:33] until he was weaned.
[2:27:36] Go. When he was finally weaned and other
[2:27:40] she wasn't nursing him, he was potty
[2:27:43] trained. She brought him to the temple
[2:27:47] and she left him there for God's service
[2:27:52] because she promised God, "Lord, if
[2:27:55] you'll do this for [music] me, I'll give
[2:27:57] this son to your service." And that son
[2:28:00] turned out to be Samuel, one of the
[2:28:02] greatest prophets in God's Bible.
[2:28:07] If you give your life to God,
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; his benefits to you are exceedingly and
[2:28:16] abundantly above that which we can even
[2:28:20] think.
[2:28:23] And I know Matthew encouraged those of
[2:28:25] you this morning [music] who haven't
[2:28:28] given your life to the Lord, go back.
[2:28:32] Those of us that have backslid, let's
[2:28:35] rededicate our lives back to the Lord.
[2:28:39] We're going into a new year. I thought
[2:28:41] this evangelistic [music]
[2:28:42] service this morning was just what we
[2:28:45] had need of. Let's reive our lives and
[2:28:49] [music]
[2:28:49] and rededicate
[2:28:52] our lives to the Lord and remember
[2:28:56] [music] it was by the blood.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; I like to sing that. There is the blood
[2:29:01] that. So this morning [music] when you
[2:29:03] think about it, think that what he said.
[2:29:06] You were paid for
[2:29:08] by deity.
[2:29:12] [music]
[2:29:13] That's a pretty strong thought.
[2:29:17] You could say, well, David McGary gave
[2:29:19] his life for me.
[2:29:21] And that might carry [music]
[2:29:24] a little bit of weight,
[2:29:27] but when you can say deity,
[2:29:30] [music]
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; I was purchased by God.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; And if you can take that faith, [music]
[2:29:41] you can look at Satan [singing] and say,
[2:29:42] "You've got no hold on me.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; I am going to overcome.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to overcome these [music]
[2:29:49] problems. I'm going to overcome these
[2:29:51] things. And it's a mind battle.
[2:29:54] But if you'll walk with him every day,
[2:29:58] [music]
[2:29:59] you'll touch the hem of his garment
[2:30:01] [singing] every day. You'll pray to him
[2:30:03] [music] every day. You'll read your
[2:30:05] Bible every day. I implore you to
[2:30:08] [music] put on a tape
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; and listen. God will speak to you.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; You'll find yourself lifted up.
[2:30:19] You'll be like Hannah. My mouth is
[2:30:22] enlarged
[2:30:24] over my enemy. You know what that means?
[2:30:26] In other words, I'm speaking to my
[2:30:28] enemy. He's [music] not speaking to me.
[2:30:30] My mouth is enlarged over [music] my
[2:30:34] enemy.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; I'm telling my enemy. He's not [singing]
[2:30:38] telling me. Why? Because I rejoice
[2:30:42] [music]
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; in the salvation
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Amen.
[2:30:48] [music]
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. There [singing] is a blood
[2:30:57] [music]
[2:30:58] that made my way.
[2:31:02] [music]
[2:31:07] [music and singing]
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; That was for you.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Think of it. My sins [music]
[2:31:16] were
[2:31:19] my sins
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; for God. [music]
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; They're forgotten
[2:31:24] to
[2:31:28] Christ. [music]
[2:31:31] His precious [music] blood.
[2:31:40] [music and singing]
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:31:54] [music]
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; I define
[2:31:59] [singing]
[2:32:01] [music]
[2:32:04] [singing]
[2:32:08] [music]
[2:32:13] [singing] I love
[2:32:17] you. [music]
[2:32:22] [singing]
[2:32:23] And he's coming [music]
[2:32:25] back.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; He's coming back.
[2:32:29] [music]
[2:32:37] It [music] is the [singing]
[2:32:42] holy power
[2:32:46] [music]
[2:32:49] to [singing]
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; purchase my deity. [music]
[2:32:56] [singing]
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; can you just say pour down on me this
[2:33:09] morning, [music]
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; oh Lord,
[2:33:17] [music]
[2:33:18] because he [singing]
[2:33:24] [music]
[2:33:27] [singing]
[2:33:30] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music]
[2:33:40] [music]
[2:33:46] Heat. Hey, Heat. [music]
[2:33:52] [music]
[2:33:52] [singing]
[2:33:56] sing
[2:34:00] [music]
[2:34:00] [singing]
[2:34:02] that he's coming back for.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; He's [music] coming back for you.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Happy New Year. I hope
[2:34:15] you can all join us [music] next
[2:34:17] Wednesday night. Live for God.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; Live for God.
[2:34:24] Cut the things of the world away one by
[2:34:26] one. Just chop [music] chopping them off
[2:34:29] and live for God. Confess with your
[2:34:32] mouth. Speak it out every day. Lord, I'm
[2:34:36] living this day for you. I'm turning my
[2:34:39] life around. I'm going to take this
[2:34:41] word. I'm going to be a Christian. Lord,
[2:34:44] I'm not going to let you. My mouth is
[2:34:47] enlarged over my [music] enemy. God
[2:34:50] bless you. Go in peace. Amen.
[2:34:54] Amen. You love him this morning. Is he
[2:34:57] good? [music]
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; When's he good?
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; All the time. God's good. God bless you.
[2:35:03] Go in peace. Let's sing it as we go.
[2:35:08] Oh, if you're [singing] walking
[2:35:12] to the valley
[2:35:14] and the shadow
[2:35:16] all [singing] around.
[2:35:20] Oh, do not fear. [music]
[2:35:23] He will guide [singing]
[2:35:24] you.
[2:35:26] He will keep you safe [music] and
[2:35:32] [singing] he promised
[2:35:34] to [music] never leave you
[2:35:38] for you
[2:35:41] and his word [music and singing] is
[2:35:43] true.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; will [music]
[2:36:03] is [music]
[2:36:04] the light will shine. God is good.
[2:36:09] Oh, God is good.
[2:36:13] [music]
[2:36:14] Oh, I like it. Oh, we worship
[2:36:19] for our [music] worthy
[2:36:22] fil
[2:36:25] [music]
[2:36:30] his holy spirit.
[2:36:33] Now [music] we can
[2:36:36] [singing]
[2:36:38] [music]
[2:36:40] love
[2:36:41] his everlasting
[2:36:45] and his mercy.
[2:36:48] We will [singing] never [music]
[2:36:55] Heat. Heat.
[2:36:57] [music]
[2:37:05] [music]
[2:37:09] is
[2:37:12] [music]
[2:37:12] shine.
[2:37:17] [music]
[2:37:30] Heat. Heat.
[2:37:35] [music]
