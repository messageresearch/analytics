You know as the Bible teaches us that God God condescended and became one of us so we can be like him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know we thank the Lord for this message. Um brother Brandham teaches us that you know even the angels are so filthy in front of God that they say holy holy 24/7. And if it not for this message, you would have never known the standard that God requires. God required death because of sin. That he subjected his own self to his own law. But we thank God that the word has given us a better way, has given us an understanding of what it, you know, what he requires for us to be his bride. So I hope this is a blessing to you. down from his glory. Everliving story. My God and saving came and Jesus was his name. Morning in a manger [Music] to his own strangeanger [Music] of sorrows, tears and God. [Music] Oh, how I love him. How I adore you.

How I adore him. My break, my sun. I in all the great creator. He became my savior and all God's fullness dwelling in him. [Music] I surely enjoyed that. I know you enjoyed it, too. We have an announcement here. Brother Adrian writes, "We want to thank the Lord for one more year of life for our son, Angel. May the Lord continue to bless him, guide him in all he does." Happy birthday, Angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's another birthday today, but he happens to be in a different country. Brother Billy, his birthday is today, &gt;&gt; so we'll have to get him when he gets back. We love Brother Billy. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have any other announcements. We want to remember Daniel. It was mentioned yesterday that there were some uh complications post surgery that took place and he's back in the hospital. So, we trust that the Lord can touch him and help him on his path of recovery. If you have any request and you came into the house of the Lord with something on your heart, make it known to him by the uplifting of your hands and trust that that allsufficient God who wanted to condescend cares about you and he's got an answer for you. and you can receive it by the preaching of the word. We also want to remember our pastor and sister Leslie and they they travel tomorrow morning. May God be with them, Lord, and just give them blessings and just walk with them in all that they do. We'll ask brother David Junior to come and take these needs before the congregation and the brothers that are taking the tithes and offering if they could please come up. Why don't we just go ahead and stand together just to give ourselves a a moment to just think about who we're approaching. Let's just bring our hearts together before him. Gracious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; what a great privilege it is to bow our hearts and our heads before you and know that you hear the very petition of our heart. And Lord, that you're mindful of each need that's here in this building from the smallest to the eldest. Lord, there's nothing that's too small or too great, Father. And Lord, if we could just better understand your love for us, the care that you have, then Lord, our faith could rise up to believe that all things are possible. And Lord, as these requests have been spoken, Lord, we know that you're the God of the impossible. Father, where man could fail, you cannot fail. Lord, that your word will accomplish that which you send it forth to accomplish. And Lord, we're now speaking your word upon our lips, Father, that you're the Lord God that heals all our diseases. Father, that you're a present help, Lord, in the time of need. And Lord, as the need is great, Father, so much more than need me, dear Lord. And Father, now our hearts are looking even to what your word will accomplish. And Lord, it's you. your presence where you are, Father. Darkness cannot abide. All things are possible to them that believe. And Lord, you've given us a faith to believe. We're going to thank you for that. We're going to praise you, Father. We're looking now that just each one would be aware of your divine presence here, Lord. As we've gathered together as a body, Lord, we love you. You're the lovely one. You're welcome amongst us, Lord. Lord, you're welcome in every room of my heart, every place of my mind. I want to commit myself aresh to you this morning, Lord. If there's been anything I've held on to, Lord, if there's been any any idea, anything of myself that needs to be burned out, oh God, by the power of your of your word, Lord, by your precious presence, come but consume me aresh, Lord. Lord, as a body, we're sitting upon your altar this morning, Lord. We're asking you to come and do only that which you can do. Thank you for hearing the request of our hearts, for the needs that are spoken, our brother Daniel, Lord, and you deliver him, Father, from where he's at, the pain, the the anguish, Lord, that he in a greater way will know your love and care for him. And Lord, that our pastor and sister Lesie as they would travel, Lord, our hearts would be that they would stay here with us. And Lord, we wouldn't want them to go. We know though that you have a will and a path that he would walk in. Lord, we ask that you'd protect him, Lord, that your angels would go before him. And Lord, the burden that's on his heart to see your gospel furthered, Father, that that'll be delivered. And Lord, you know all things and we commit it to your hands, even this service, the rest of it. In the precious name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. [Music] Then all I see is the blood that still cleans saves me. It's the grace that still sets me free. [Music] Well to praise him. Oh, I know that your blood. [Music] I'm walking in some of my Oh, I cannot fall. It's greater than all. The blood of the lamb, greater than all my sin. Oh gater than all my sin is a blood that so [Music] me. It's the grace that still sets me free. Oh, to praise him. [Music] And I know that [Music] I'm walking in and I can not fall. Oh, it's gater than all the blood of the lamb. Let's all stand as we sing. There is a blood. [Music] [Music] There is a blood that cost that my way and death it [Music] And when he flow out from the cross, I sing for God. [Music] I see God. There is a great that [Music] precious blood. Oh, who might he breathe again [Music] and ros to stand in my face. And so I come to tell you to tell you that he cries every tear that [Music] I come to tell you that [Music] shout to that is back for you. We &gt;&gt; invite our pastor at this time. There is a blood that oh that gives us the lonely father. Oh it has the power [Music] to [Music] as they fall upon the ground. [Music] Oh, glory out to my soul and good glory because he liv I owe my heart. I [Music] So I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he everyone. Oh, I come to tell you that shout to [Music] you. &gt;&gt; My gracious father, that's the motivation of every step we take every day is your coming back. some glad morning that dimensional open and we'll step from this unreal lost world into eternal reality forever to be with you. Father, may it become so real to us that we look up because we know our redemption drawth nigh. May the love that you have for us shed abroad in our heart to the lost and the hurting, Father, because we know it's the enemy. And we know that he who's in us is greater than he who's in the world. We ask you to bless our morning, Father. We ask that you'd minister to the needs of the people, that you'd heal our sick, that you would lift up the weary and brokenhearted. And that in you, Father, that we could see hope because all things are possible to them that believe. We ask this this morning in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Certainly wonderful to be in the house of the Lord serving a God that you know that all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it doesn't matter. It didn't say some things are possible. &gt;&gt; It said all things are possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't know some things, he knows everything. &gt;&gt; So, you know, if if you know, they used to sing that song. I grew up with it all the time. It's about Santa Claus, you know. You say, "He knows if you've been naughty, he knows if you've been nice, you know." And I mean, I thought, man, I know somebody that knows that who's a whole lot more greater than some fake Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; But he knows. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That's a good thing. because he knows what causes my failures. He knows how to fix me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we certainly rejoice in that. Um, we have a visiting minister this morning, uh, Brother Zachary Wallace. I knew his grandfather, I knew his father, and now I know him. So, we're into the third generation here. Hallelujah. I sure hope he comes soon. Amen. So, I I want to thank everybody for yesterday. We had a wonderful day yesterday. A wonderful brother's breakfast. Thank brother Chris for that. Really encourage the brothers to come out to these breakfastes that they're really wonderful and just really heartlifting. Then we had our Sunday school picnic or whatever you'd like to call it, family, young family picnic. and uh brother Tim and sister Melinda, all the teachers, all the brothers that helped. It really was a great day. We thought through the rain and we had our young kids eating corn, raw corn, and playing in the mud and and all kinds of things. It was just it I'd like to had it all on film because it was just really a great time. I think the kids had a a wonderful time. So, uh, we just really, uh, appreciate that. We want to pray for brother Matthew. He's back east and he's been preaching and he'll be here to preach for us on the 24th and then he's got meetings all through November. So, we want to keep Brother Matthew in prayer. Brother Billy's in London. I think it's his birthday. So, um, no presents from us, Billy. You're you're too far away. But I'm sure he's streaming this morning and I think he has a meeting with the king and the so um the real king. &gt;&gt; The king of kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not some temporary throne. So anyway, and then uh brother Sergio's in Alta Oklahoma uh preaching for us. So, uh, and then don't forget communion Sunday. Uh, November 2nd, communion. We should all be there for communion because it's it's a wonderful time. Communion. Communion's got healing in it. It's got deliverance in. Got everything you need. Just humble yourself. Make your heart right with God. Make your heart right with your brothers and sisters. Come have communion and watch what God does for you. Amen. He longs for your fellowship. So as as the brothers mentioned, Lesie and I leave for Zambia tomorrow evening and we have meetings there the 24th, 25th and 26th uh for brother Ronnie Kabichi and the uh dedication of his new church uh his addition and remodel of his church. So we're looking for that. And then on November 7th and 8th, we'll be in Tucson uh having one of the services for brother Israel uh Poe there in Tucson, Arizona. And uh uh brother George Smith will be preaching there and brother uh George Ferguson. So that's uh if you want to drift out, that's fine. But our meetings are the following weekend. So, we have a lot on on our plates, but we want to keep busy. We want to keep going. All that we have, we want to do for the kingdom while we can still do it. You know what I mean? My bones ache, but they still got strength. So, I I want to be used up by God. I remember when they prayed for me, when they laid hands on me to uh I don't know what you call it, to ordain me, if you would use that terminology, they they asked the brothers asked the Lord to say, "May his candle be totally used up." And that's what I want to do. I want to be used up for the Lord. We've got a lot of young great preachers here in our church that can go forward. So, if we can do some work outside for the furthest of the kingdom, we'll certainly be uh wanting to do that. So, do you love them this morning? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that God knows what you have need of &gt;&gt; before that you ever ask it? You know, um that's a great confidence. It used to scare me and now I I realized I read a story that brother Ram told about you know the story about when she that washing Jesus feet that you know and he said when that little prostitute stood there oh brother Mike and Ellen Parks are with us &gt;&gt; and this is here today because of what he helped us do &gt;&gt; I don't 20 years ago I Yes, brother Mike. So, I'm never forgot it. the time we sat there in the banker's office and and uh put all our paperwork together and and we're trying to get a little loan or something for this building next door and and sure enough the banker comes out and it was a guy that I happened to know and and that helped and then Mike closed the deal and so it didn't stop from there and we got a bigger church waiting in the skyline. So we appreciate you, brother, with all our heart. So we want you to uh to know that. But in the story, he talks about the the little lady and she said she saw him and she ran quick and took her money and bought some ointment and she stood back and she wanted to wash his feet. And she began to think the battle began to go on in her mind. And she said, "He will know where I got this money. He'll know what I had to do to pay for this money." And so she began to shrink back and be afraid because of what that he would know about her. But there's another part of her heart that spoke up and said, "But he's the only one that can help me." &gt;&gt; And there she went. And when she got done crying and weeping before him, she stepped up free &gt;&gt; to go with no more burdens. So he already knows this morning. &gt;&gt; So just let him come speak to your heart. He'll lift you up. He'll he'll do wonders. He'll guide you and direct you. So let's stand this morning and let's just uh maybe we'll just sing a little different song as we invite brother Zachary. It It's the one that you know uh stay. I think they call it stay. You know, you know what song that is. &gt;&gt; All right. Maybe if you got a mic over there, you can help me sing it. But you know, and it says, "I know what it's like is to be in the presence of the Lord." And maybe if you just let that presence come around you, you'll find out that he loves you. He's not ashamed of you. He died for you. But let's just let him come this morning. Let's let him know, Lord, you're welcome here. &gt;&gt; We can't we can't make it without you. And we just want you to surround our hearts this morning. I want to say I'm sorry. I want to leave my past behind and go forward. man [Music] to be in the presence of the Lord. I know what time it is because time [Music] And the bodies were [Music] families restored. [Music] Because we stay here in the presence of the Lord. No one had to say a word [Music] to make a sound. [Music] I give up everything [Music] for this treasure. I never wanted to [Music] change. I don't want you to know my heart is burning in your presence. [Music] Oh, please stay. I don't want you to go. My heart is burning in your presence, Lord. I want [Music] I want [Music] and I want [Music] Jesus. I want [Music] I want more. I want more. [Music] I want more. Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this morning is for more of him. &gt;&gt; You don't have to leave this place without more of him this morning. If you're desiring, if you're hungering, he's here to meet that hunger. He's here to meet that desire. I I just pray you came ready for church this morning. You know, a lot of people they they take a shower to come to church. That's fine. I appreciate that. I really do. Some people they brush their hair, you know, they get their their suit on. But did you pray this morning? Did you really get ready for church this morning and say, "God, I want to meet with you. I want you to speak to my heart. I want to hear from heaven today. Did you come ready for church today? or did you just come ready to meet your neighbor? Brothers and sisters, I want to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ this morning. It's just wonderful to be in his presence here. Bring you my my greetings. I I live in Ohio. I attend a church there at True Word Tabernacle with Brother Wayne Lawson and and uh bring you my greetings from there, but I'm originally from Arizona. So, if you've ever been out there and received a cannon salute, you you were at my dad's house. And uh so, we've known the the McGary family for for as long as I've been alive. And grew up around the dinner table hearing my dad tell people about the testimonies of God's grace and brother David's life. And and so, I've just grown up hearing about how God was so good to him and brought him through everything to lead him to the truth. And and so, it's just wonderful to be here with you now. And I appreciate the opportunity and the privilege to be here. And I I enjoyed the the fellowship we had with the the younger group yesterday. It was it was good and all the effort that goes into that. That's a tremendous amount of work. And and it's a labor of love because you know a lot of time the younger children might not even say thank you. But uh it's a real labor of of love for them. And you know yesterday we we took a thought on come follow me where Jesus is talking to that rich young ruler. And you know, we look at that and we say, "Oh, that's that's good for the kids." You know, remind them to follow Jesus. And that's true. But do you know who he is? Because Jesus Christ isn't off in Galilee somewhere. Jesus Christ is the word for this hour. And if you're going to follow Jesus Christ like that rich young ruler was given the opportunity, then you've got to forsake everything. You've got to forsake your own ideas. You got to forsake your own thinking, your own teachings. You got to lay everything aside and say, "Lord, I'm following you and you only." And that gets to be where it's a little more than a Sunday school lesson. It's something that hits us right in the heart because I want to give him my all. I want to follow him with everything I have. Not a not a historical Jesus off in Galilee somewhere, but the present tense Lord Jesus Christ. And it's just uh good time yesterday, and I'm expecting a a good time in the Lord this morning. And if we could just go to the Lord in prayer. Lord, we we love you, Lord. And we're so thankful to be gathered together with saints of like precious faith, Lord, and to feel your presence here among us. To know that according to your word that you promised you would be here, Lord, and and to recognize your presence among your people. And we just ask that you would have your way in the service this morning, Lord. And I just ask that you would take this unprofitable servant, Lord, and you would use me to express your thoughts to your people this morning. We just want to yield ourselves to you and may you have your way among us. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If we could just read in the book of Mark, the 16th chapter, and uh verse 15, we'll take a a reading from there just real short. uh something that I'm sure we all have memorized, but something I hope we never forget. Mark 16 and 15. It's Jesus speaking to his disciples. He said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." You can be seated this morning. Just want to take a thought on on the true gospel. The true gospel. And and and you know, there's the the word gospel, it it means good news. And and so there's a lot of people that go around and they they say they've got some good news to share with you and they say, "Listen, you know, the the economy is going up. you know, things are looking better and they they want to tell you that's the good news. But you know what? That's not the good news because the economy is up one day and what happens the next day? It's down the next day. And and so there's the up and the down of the economy. That that's not the good news we're talking about. We're not talking about going around and and telling everybody, you know, America's the the best country in the world. You know, I do appreciate it, but it has its ups and downs, too. And and everything that you might look at and say, "Well, this is the good news. I want everybody to know about this. It'll have a time when it's good and then there will be a season when it's down. But the gospel, the good news is the fact that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; And that's true yesterday. That's true today. That'll be true tomorrow. There's no changing the reality that my Lord Jesus has raised from the dead. And so that is the true gospel. It's the news that Jesus Christ is not dead, but he's alive. And I want to look a little bit about what that means for us in in present tense and and how that that that has an impact. It has a meaning for us today. And and back uh I I've had the opportunity to travel for mission work the last few years. I I really appreciate brother David having a heart for for missions and and to go out and to preach this gospel to every creature because it's needful because we want to go home and there's still people there that need to hear the gospel. And and last week I I got to be over in in Pakistan up north of India there. It's a it's an Islamic nation. And we we were visiting with the people there. And I and this thought really just began to burn in my heart of of what what we're we're inviting these people to church. We're inviting these people to come and and and come to the church. But what what are we telling these people? What what is it that we're trying to bring them to? Because you know the the the Muslims, they have the religions. We we have the Hindus there. We have all of these different groups. We have the Catholics, very strong Catholic community. We have all these different denominations, different religions gathered around and we're inviting them, come on over to the church. But what are we inviting them to? &gt;&gt; What are we presenting to them? Are we just telling them, "Oh, well, come and and and and find another religion." Are we telling them just, you know, come to come to this church and and you know, you can have a different lifestyle? What are we actually presenting to them with? Are we just coming together to say, "Hey, this is where we gather on Sundays. You can gather together with us." We sing a few songs. We hear some preaching. And then we go back home and and and we just live the same life we've always lived and there's no change. There's no power. There's no reality. What are we presenting to the people? and and it just began to burn in my heart that we're presenting them with the gospel and and and the true gospel, not a not a denominational gospel of just come and join and and be a part of the church and be a member and like that's not what we're presenting to the people as church membership. We're not presenting to the people an identity that you have a new name and you're called a Christian and and you go to church and you know you can you can even you can put it on your your ID in those countries. you can put on there, I am a Christian or I am a Muslim. But that's not what I'm talking about when I talk about the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm talking about something that has a power in it. I'm talking about something that has a reality in it. I'm talking about a living Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That is the gospel. That's the good news. And and I want to go through a few things the prophet mentioned here that kind of sets a tone for the thought this morning. He says here in God's provided approach to divine fellowship, I say this that the gospel yet in its simplicity preached in the power of the blood is the greatest drawing card the world has ever knowed. He says, "And believe thou this, give us some more Baptists like John. He stirred the regions." What was it? His eloquency? No. Because he had no such great speech. Uh no, it was psychology. No, he preached Christ. And the preaching of Christ will stir the people it's true. No matter if it's simplicity, it's just the greatest drawing card the world ever knowed is the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he says here, and I believe this this isn't just true for for you know, Jeffersonville where he was talking, but it's it's true of of Texas right down here. He says that's what we need. what we that's what some of these churches around Louisville and Jeffersonville and New Albany need. It's a good old-fashioned shaking down God sent Holy Ghost revival. Then you can have a healing service and decent and in order and and God will bless and the altars will be full and and you don't need some new theology. You need the Holy Spirit preached in its power. Though in simplicity, it's the greatest drawing card the world's ever had. Oh, to know that I have the greatest drawing card the world's ever had. It's the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The news that my God's not dead. He's not in a grave. He's not back 2,000 years ago. But he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And all the power he ever had when he walked in Nazareth is right here in this building this morning. That is some good news. &gt;&gt; Oh, the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. and he told his disciples, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel." Now, the preaching of the gospel, it's not just a a teaching of theory. It's not just a teaching of a a standard of theology or or some kind of a seminary teaching. It's it's something beyond that. It's something more than that. And and I I appreciate doctrine, and we need doctrine. You've got to have it. I appreciate, you know, teaching. It's good. We've got to have it. That's important. If you're not teaching the word of God, then you know, you're you're way off in the wrong direction. But there's something more than just a talking about the word of God. There's something more than just a well, you know, you go to the denominations, you go to these churches out here and they'll say, John 3:16, yes, I believe it. And that's good. You should believe it. This this church here had better be a word church. If this church here is not a word church, then you guys need to get back to the foundation and establish it as a word church. It's got to be a word-based solid church. And that's wonderful. That's important. You've got to have it. I' I've been to churches that weren't that way. And brother, it's rough to preach there because they ain't got a clue what you're talking about. You talk about the word and and they don't know what where you're at because they don't know the word of God. And so we we must know the word. And that's important. And we we recognize in Genesis or in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. We we see that that condescending of God and and so we recognize that that God is the word and and and that's who he is. That's his identity. And and I but I want to re you recognize that it's not just when we talk about in the beginning was the word. We're not talking about a a book floating around up in space somewhere. &gt;&gt; When we talk about the logos, you have that picture there. Uh when we talk about the logos, we're not talking about a a a a theory or a a a bunch of pages. We're talking about the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. We're talking about a person. The person that we see over the the prophet of God there, that was not just a a a book. That is a person. It's the logos. It's Jesus Christ. And that's the one we're talking about that was in the beginning. The pillar of fire. Now, that pillar of fire is also the anointing. It's the Holy Ghost. It's the when you get the word, not just in letter form, not just in page, but when you get it in fire form, when you get it in power form, now you've got something that'll put the dynamics back into the church. And so, when when we say we want the word in our church, what are we talking about? Oh, absolutely. We're talking about the Bible 100%. But it's not a dead letter. &gt;&gt; It's a person. &gt;&gt; In the Perkamian church age, the prophet of God says, uh, speaking how Christ is is speaking to that church and drawing them to himself and and he says, "I am the word." If you want deity in your midst, then welcome and receive the word. Don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word. And he goes on a little bit later to say, I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy 3:15, he speaking there and Paul to Timothy. He says, "From a child, you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. And all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction and righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto all good works. The word of God, it's the it's it's a foundation. It's the the the doctrine we bring for the the church. It's wonderful. And and in Isaiah 28, it tells us that precept must be upon precept and line upon line and here a little and there a little. don't just take, you know, one little one little line in there and create a whole uh doctrine out of it. It it lines up. This scripture runs in continuity. It runs in harmony. And if you ever try to take one little verse and set it off by itself and and make something out of it that it it's not, you'll get yourself all out of cater trying to build the the church of God. But it's line upon line, word upon word, and it grows and it builds. But I it's growing up into a body, a word body. And that's the word that's come in this hour. It wasn't just a a Lutheran doctrine of just shall live by faith. It's that plus plus more. It's not just a Wesleyan doctrine of of sanctification and you should live a Christian life. The word has been adding line upon line, word upon word. And it's been growing up until it's come now in this hour. We have the fullness of the word. We have not just a part of the word, a part of the revelation. We have the fullness of the word unfolded to us in this hour which is that logos again here in the sermon things that are to be the prophet of God. He says now if if if we are those attributes of God are you &gt;&gt; are you one of those attributes of God? If we are those attributes of God we cannot live by creeds. We cannot live by denominationalism. We must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband. Therefore, we must be that word bride. And what is that word bride? The manifestation of this hour. The bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of God. A living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride. that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living. The attributes of God being expressed in the formation of the bride. But I want you to notice, it's not a dead bride. &gt;&gt; It's a living bride. It's a living word. It's a living manifestation. It's an expression &gt;&gt; of the word of God in shoe leather. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was Christ? What was Jesus? He was the word made flesh. Invisible union. He says, he says, "And now the word, the word is becoming flesh, and the flesh is becoming word." &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians, he says, "Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, &gt;&gt; but of the spirit. For the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life." Th those Pharisees, they were so set on the the word, the word, the word, which it was the word. They had the commandments and they were so fixated on the letter of it that when the flesh of the word came manifested in front of them, they rejected it and they crucified it because they could not see the manifestation of that word. &gt;&gt; Looked it right in the eye and they said, "You're claiming to be God. &gt;&gt; That you're a man and you're making yourself God." And it was God making himself man. And they're looking at him and they're saying what's you know you're saying that you knew Moses like he says well yes before Moses was I am &gt;&gt; they looked at him they knew the word they had it memorized &gt;&gt; but they didn't know the person &gt;&gt; you know I grew up as a young boy all of my life hearing this message hearing tapes played at night and hearing and hearing it and that's wonderful. I appreciate it so much and I have a I have a real good knowledge of the word and I'm thankful for that. But don't let me miss the person &gt;&gt; because it's not to know the knowledge. That's not where the life is at. It's not just to have head knowledge and and teaching and education. That's not where the power of almighty God is laying at. But when you know the person, when you can recognize who he is, and you can welcome him, the word into your life, then deity has come down and when deity is there, all power in heavens and earth is present to give you whatsoever you have need of. &gt;&gt; The word is not a theory. It's not a teaching. It's not knowledge. The word is a person. It is Jesus Christ. Oh, I ask you, are you tired of religion? Religion and forms of man and traditions and all of these different things that they bring in as a dead type of a religion and oh, just go to this place and and put your offering in and tell your Hail Mary and and do this and and make sure you make your pilgrimage to to Mecca or whatever the forms and the religion of man. I'm not interested in religion, but I do know a person. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Christian life is not about dead traditions and forms and oh, we just go to church on Sunday and then we go home and and we go through back to work and then we go be we become a Christian again on Sunday. No, it's a re everyday present tense reality where you have the power of almighty God flowing through your vessel. &gt;&gt; My God's not dead. And the gospel I've been commissioned to preach is tell everybody I come in contact with that he is alive. &gt;&gt; But in this last day there there is a a a spirit that's come down on the age and and we and it speaks of it in 2 Timothy 3 that the last day they would be treaders traitors heavy heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Now, I want you to recognize they love God. They go to church. They call themselves Christian. But you know what they love more than going to church? Their own pleasure, their own comfort. You know what they they they love? Oh, I love God. I believe in God. Yes. You know, I believe those things are true. That's good. That's wonderful. But I'd rather do my own thing. I love my own things more than God. You stay in that condition and you'll be the exact same way that rich young ruler was when he lifted up his eyes in hell and realized he'd missed his opportunity to follow Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Set your affection singular. Set your affection on things above, not on things down here. &gt;&gt; And in this last day, they will be that way. They'll be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness. &gt;&gt; A form of godliness. They will look like God. Godliness is to be like God. And they'll have a form and they will have a form of godliness, but they'll deny the power thereof. From such turn away. I'm not interested in a form of godliness. I'm not interested in looking the part and and acting the part. What I want is the power of almighty God coming down inside of me and him expressing himself in reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not interested in manmade religion or man-made forms or man-made creeds or dogmas. What he's looking for is a religion with power in it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet in the pardon, he says, "But when a church comes under the blood of Jesus Christ with the token of the Holy Spirit upon them, then you're going to see brotherhood again. You're going to see a church full of power. You're going to And God hates a powerless religion. It's got to be power. Certainly, it's a power to save a man from sin. It's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ promised. &gt;&gt; If he promised it, &gt;&gt; then I'm going to experience it. &gt;&gt; If he promised that there would be a power of God that would save a sinner, then that power is available to me. And I'm not just talking about that by theory. I experienced it. &gt;&gt; The power of God that saved me from my sins is the same power of God that's dwelling inside of me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that these signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, you look in that in Mark 16 there when when when they heard because the disciples were there and Mary and and the different ones went to the to the tomb and they go to there and they they come and they look in and they find out he's not in the grave. He's not here. And they're wondering what's going on. And they get a message. He's not dead. He's alive. &gt;&gt; And then they're told, "Go tell my disciples." &gt;&gt; Go tell him. Go tell him he's not in the grave. Go tell him he's not back 2,000 years ago. Go tell him he's not dead in some religious organization. But my God is alive and he has risen as he said he would be. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have seen a resurrection out of dark denominationalism in this hour and my God is alive. &gt;&gt; Oh, when they But you see this here and and it's so striking to consider this. These are the disciples. These are the ones that walked with Jesus. They were, you know, we would say the the greatest spiritual leaders of the day in in the real sense of the word. But when they heard he was alive, scripture says they did not believe it. A little bit later he appears to two walking down the road and says that he told they to he appeared to them and walked with him in the country. Mark 16:12 and went through the country with him and then he went they went and told it under the residue and neither believed they them. There's something about mankind that just can't accept the reality of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; There's a unbelief that just sits there and says, "No, no, he can't be alive." Like there, no, no, you know, you you're, you know, you're you're just, you know, you're just enthused. You're just imagining. You just had a hallucination. You just denying could not accept that he was alive. And afterward, Mark 16:14, "And afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me, and upraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen." There was those who had seen him after he was risen. &gt;&gt; And their job was to go and tell the others he's alive. Do I have some witnesses here this morning that have seen him? They know him personally. Not just what grandpa said, not just what some church father wrote in a book somewhere, but they've met him personally. They know him in the power of his resurrection. and they can stand there as a witness and say, "He's not in a grave. He's not dead. He's not buried by some church denominationalism, but my God is alive and he has the same power he ever had." &gt;&gt; Oh, when Jesus sent out the disciples, they went out as witnesses of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Oh, what we need today is some witnesses. Some witnesses that can go out to work and tell them the gospel of Jesus Christ. Because you know you you may never have a chance to travel to Pakistan like I did last week or to Zambia like brother David next week but somebody's got to go to your workplace and share the gospel of Jesus Christ that our God is not dead but he's alive and that there's a power there to meet the need of the people. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, this world. What they're dying for, what they're needing, what they're longing for is the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what they have need of. That's what they're looking for. This world, they're searching for for some answer, for some solution. What's the answer to all our our problems? And how do we bring peace to the earth? And and how do we deal with all the cancers and the sicknesses and all the problems? Oh, the economic problems. I mean, you look around, there's just problems everywhere. &gt;&gt; Every level you look at it, you look at the scientific community and and they're all worried about where the AI is going to take off to and they're creating AI armies that they're worried going to cause problems and and well, if we don't do it, we somebody else will, we better get our own army and and they're they're racing over here and then you've got your nuclear bombs over there and they're trying to figure out, well, well, if they shoot their nuclear bombs, how do we handle this? They've got nothing but problems over there. You look at the world nations borders and the the battles that are being fought over whose land is this and who's this belong to and which country is going to take over this and and now you got pandemics and you got cancer running rampant. You got people becoming sick with every kind of disease and diabetes sweeping the planet and everywhere you look it's a mess. &gt;&gt; There's problems on every hand. There is no person that has the answer. But I got it. &gt;&gt; It's my Lord Jesus Christ. And he is alive and he is well and he's living in me to tell that he's just the same as he ever was. &gt;&gt; Oh, but when you begin to tell people of the gospel, if there's not something inside of them to respond, they think you've gone crazy &gt;&gt; and you've got the thing that the whole world needs. Oh, you know, the devil, he he really he he does not want you to know that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead. And so, he'll do everything he can to put an unbelief, to put a question mark, to put a doubt. Is he really alive? Is, you know, they'll say, "Oh, well, he raised from the dead. Oh, yes, Jesus raised from the dead, but he's still back there in Galilee somewhere. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus raised from the dead, but he stayed in the book of Acts and didn't go anywhere else. Put him back somewhere in history. Put him back somewhere in and and some other day in some other age. Oh, well, if if Jesus Okay, I'll I'll I'll let you believe it. I'll let you believe Jesus raised from the dead. But he says, "Listen, his his power to heal that stopped with the apostles, the Holy Ghost, that that that's no longer relevant for this day. that ceased with the with the apostolic age and and all these different lies the devil begins to put. What he's trying to do is keep you from the benefits of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The benefits of the resurrection. He'll say, "Okay, I I'll if you have to believe that he raised from the dead, okay, but you can't believe that there's any benefit for your personal life from his resurrection. You you if you've got sickness, you just got to take that all the way to your grave. If you got if you got problems in your family and you've got unsaved loved ones, well, you know, there's nothing. There's no power there to go out and help them. If you've got situations that you don't know what to do about, well, you just have to sit there in your misery and hope something happens to make it better because God doesn't have the power to fix your situation. That's what the devil's putting into your mind. He'll put into your mind, no, that was for some other day. That was for the prophet. That was for Moses. That was for William Brandham. That was for And he's always telling you, but it's not for you. trying to steal the benefits of the resurrection of Jesus Christ away from your life. If he can get you to believe he didn't raise, oh, he's happy. But if he's if you've if you're convinced that he raised from the dead, then he'll start to tell you, but it's not for you. &gt;&gt; You know what? He's a liar. &gt;&gt; Or if the devil can convince you that Jesus didn't raise from the dead, then there's no benefits. There's no blessings. There's because if he didn't raise, what that means is he wasn't worthy &gt;&gt; because it had it had to be a sinless one that died and only a sinless one could raise. If he did not raise from the dead, there is no healing for your body. If he did not raise from the dead, there is no forgiveness for your sins because there has not been a worthy sacrifice. But if he raised from the dead, then he was worthy to pay the price. He was accepted. And if he is worthy, then my sins are gone. They've been washed in the blood of the lamb. If he was worthy, then my sickness has already been healed. If he was worthy, oh, everything opens up. If he was worthy, and I declare to you this morning, he is worthy. Worthy is the lamb that was slain to redeem us from our condition. Worthy is that lamb. Oh, I declare he is worthy. And he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was laid upon him. And with his stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; It's time to take access to your Christian benefits. &gt;&gt; In Psalms 103, he says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. &gt;&gt; Who forgiveth all &gt;&gt; all thine iniquities. And who health healeth all thy diseases? &gt;&gt; Who redeemth thy life from destruction, and who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfyth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. &gt;&gt; There's benefits today. &gt;&gt; Are you living below your privileges? Because there's benefits in my Lord Jesus Christ raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's He was He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. &gt;&gt; Do you have peace this morning? &gt;&gt; Are you living in a in anxiety and nervousness and worry and fear? You don't have to. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live under oppression and depression and and the torment of the devil. You don't have to live under that because he already paid the price for your peace. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's benefits this morning to serve an arisen, resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. Take advantage of your benefits this morning. You don't have to be beaten down and and all all nervous and all discouraged and and all, you know, Christians, prophet of God says a a Christian should be happy. He said we were prayed for that our joy might be full. It's something there's something about this this life, this Christian life that's real. Christians should be happy. &gt;&gt; So if you're not happy this morning, there's benefits you aren't taking advantage of. It's God's power that that that's come upon our life to give us joy unspeakable and full of glory. There is a joy in your salvation. If you don't have that joy of your salvation, you're still saved, &gt;&gt; but you're just not enjoying the benefits. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, I enjoy the benefits of being saved. I enjoy the benefits of knowing that my sins, which were black and were dark, have been taken. And I have been justified as though I never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Oh, that sets my soul to rejoicing. It gives me a happiness. It gives my feet light feet. Like brother Brandham said, he says, "Get your joy shoes on." He says, "It does something to you when you realize &gt;&gt; that my sins are gone." &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, well, that's simple. That's such a simple thought. My sins are gone." Yes. But if you ever could really grasp it, &gt;&gt; then there wouldn't be one hindrance to keep you from accepting your healing because there's nothing between you and the savior. You say, "Oh, well, if I could just be good enough, then the Lord would heal me." No, that sacrifice was what was good enough. The Lord Jesus Christ paid the price and that settles it. You say, "Oh, if I could just be good enough to get the Holy Ghost." Listen, it is a gift. It's not something you earn. It's the gift of the Holy Ghost. So, what you have to do is to receive it. &gt;&gt; You receive salvation. You receive healing. You receive the Holy Ghost. You don't earn it. You don't work for it. You accept it &gt;&gt; because he was worthy. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was listening to the prophet this morning in a sermon called God's power. And man, that was just a revival for me right there. The power of God. And and he said something in there that just so blessed me. He said, "It's God's power that feeds the sparrow." &gt;&gt; It's God's power that feeds the sparrow. &gt;&gt; God cares about a sparrow. He cares so much that he makes sure that sparrow got his breakfast this morning. &gt;&gt; God cares about a sparrow. every sparrow. I don't know how many millions of them there are on this world, but God cares about every sparrow. And not one of them can fall down on the ground. But what he notices it and the prophet says by his power, he feeds the sparrows. &gt;&gt; Brother David, if he'd do that for a sparrow, &gt;&gt; if he's using his power to take care of the sparrow, what about the sons and the daughters of God? If you have a need this morning, I say his power is there to supply your need. And he knows and he sees it and he cares. &gt;&gt; Oh, he cares. But do you care? &gt;&gt; Oh, I was over over there in Pakistan last week and I heard a testimony there. I met the sister and and we we talked it over and it was just so powerful. There was a young girl there, a pastor's daughter. She She's about 18. She'd been about 17, I guess. 17, 18, and she got a a blood a blood uh disease, and she began to it began to attack the neurological pathways in her brain, and everything was just going wrong with her. They were at the doctor back and forth trying to to to deal with this. And and pretty soon, she she lost all mobility in her body. She was completely paralyzed. And she's just laying there, her her brain's being attacked. Her her uh her her body was just shutting down. And and then she she lost her eyesight, went completely blind for months. She's laying there paralyzed, blind. And then she began to lose all of her memory. She lo she she forgot everything she knew from school. She forgot she got to where she didn't even know who her father and mother were. She knew nobody. Knew no one's name. Nothing. Completely lost everything. But they told me they said she forgot who her dad's sitting there. She forgot who I was. He she forgot who her mother was. She forgot everything. But there was one thing she kept remembering and kept saying. She kept saying only believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can forget a lot of things, friends. You can forget a lot of things. But if you can remember the main thing, if you can remember Jesus Christ, it'll make all the difference. And she's laying there in her blindness. She's laying there in this paralyzed condition. She can't remember anything of her life. She can't remember her own family. But the one thing she knew was that my God can do all things. &gt;&gt; And you know when I met her, she was standing on two feet. She could remember everything. And her eyes had come open. Only believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't what the doctors figured out. It was the hand of the great physician. &gt;&gt; Cuz one day, her eyes just snapped open. One day, Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2, "Brethren, when I came to you, I came not with the excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I'm determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. and my speech and my preaching was not with the enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power. That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what is it that makes the power and demonstration uh in the church? It's the true gospel. &gt;&gt; It's the it's the it's the news that Jesus Christ is alive. It's the reality of a resurrection. We don't we don't serve a Jesus Christ that's dead, but he's alive. And he cares about the sparrows. And he cares about every single one of you as you were driving on the way to church this morning. He was watching over your vehicle. He was watching over the road because his eyes on the sparrow and he's also watching over you this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. His reality is the same. His power is the same. And he's here. But I I want you to understand, I'm not talking about a I'm not talking about just a a a spirit. And I'm not talking about just a book, but I'm talking about a person. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it's the pure. Speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ, he says the pure, unadulterated. Oh, hallelujah. Leaving soon for the skies. Standing ready. Think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word. The word became blood. The word bled for you. And you are washed in bleeding word. This book can't bleed. But the word made flesh. The word made flesh came down and washed us in his bleeding word. And I want you to recognize though that that bleeding word is not something of history. It's a present tense reality. In this day, Jesus Christ came down in the fullness of his word. And he was crucified by the denominations. He was crucified by the religions of this world. And the prophet of God says when they did that, that's when the word came into full effect. Oh, you must be under the water of the bleeding word, washed by the word, not of a Lutheran day. That the Luther's day had its word and it was a living word in Luther's day. And and what Wesley had a word and it was a living word in Wesley's day. But I'm talking about the living word of today. Not the living word of a yesterday, but the living word of right now. The word of God for this hour. You must be washed in that living bleeding word. Oh, you know, stat brother Brandham talks a lot about those those dynamics and mechanics and talks about those two cars and you get the one car and it's it's it's got everything in it. It's got diamond studded steering wheel and it's got, you know, chromeplated wheels and everything's just beautiful and it looks just like a church is supposed to look and that's good. That's wonderful. Over here we have another church and it's got the same thing. It's got the steering wheel. It's got the the the the the the leather seats and it's a beautiful looking car and that's wonderful. He says but there was one little thing different about them two vehicles. Says one of them didn't have a spark plug. Both of them were filled up with high octane gasoline. They had a power inside of them &gt;&gt; potentially. Potential power was sitting there, but it was lacking one thing. It was lacking that spark that would take it and would drive it down the road under the power of the Holy Ghost. And he says that's the way the churches are today and shows how they're in that same condition. And and and and I want to read it here. Uh uh rising of the sun. He says, "And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we are his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now. The beneficiaries of his life. The life there never was a life like his. He was the son of God and he died and then it sh shut it out and but he was raised from the dead. And on Easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring the good news to every person that he is living. And how can we do it by word only? For it's written, the gospel came not by word only, but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive. Now, there is there is another gospel as Paul spoke of in one of the groups and I'm surprised that you're turned to another gospel which is no other but but it's a makebelieve gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news. But because I live, ye live also. And I live in you. And the works that I do, the works in John 14:12, the works that I do will identify myself in you. Oh, what a message. No wonder we had a dark world of theology. But in the evening time there shall come light again. There will be a resurrection. And in the evening time, and it shall be light at the evening time. Have you seen the resurrection of Jesus Christ in this last hour when he raised up after 2,000 years of being buried under the teachings and the traditions of man? But he's no longer bound by that denominational tradition. He has raised from that. And there's people that might want to say that he doesn't have power today. And maybe he don't have power in their life, but he has power in my life because I have accepted the rising of the sun. I have recognized his presence as a reality today. &gt;&gt; Oh, and my commission is to go tell everyone that he is alive. &gt;&gt; That's the gospel of Jesus Christ. Not just a a word or a teaching or a theory, but a person. &gt;&gt; Oh, a risen resurrected savior. Talking about that paragraph 103 of the rising of the sun. No matter how much theologians claim and and how well you get your churches set and how much education you got and how much like the Bible until that wave sheath until that Holy Spirit comes upon the person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word and and it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move. We put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic. It needs the dynamic power of God, the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline. &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, we have a word in this hour and it's a powerful word. And we have the Holy Ghost in the church to take that word and manifest it in its power. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not le interested in dead religion. I I I have been to India and seen their idols on the side of the road and I've come year after year and they were still there and they'd never moved. They have no life. They have no power. But that's not my God. My God is alive and he's moving and he's sweeping through this building this morning looking for somebody that'll reach out and take a hold of the hem of his garment. Looking for somebody that will recognize his presence. The prophet of God says when you recognize his presence, that's what releases his power to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophet God said in message of grace, it takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ under present tense. It doesn't take theology. It doesn't take education. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take your your prestige. It takes humility dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ to present tense. And what I'm looking for this morning is Jesus Christ in present tense &gt;&gt; because he has everything that I have need of. &gt;&gt; Oh, prophet in the rising of the sun. If you haven't heard that sermon lately, brother, sister, there is a wonderful treasure trove in there. But he says, "I'm afraid that too many of us are not getting the people to Christ. We're getting them to a church, to a theory, but we must get them to Christ. He is the one, the only one that that has life. For he that has the son has life." &gt;&gt; Well, what I'm interested in is life. I'm interested in a power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that could take a dead man and raise him back to life. I'm not talking about just in Jesus's day. I'm not talking about a Lazarus, but I'm talking about the same power that's here in this day that's going to bring forth the dead out of the grave that's going to transform this mortal body. I'm talking about that kind of a power because that's the hour we're living in. We're living in the hour when the we which are alive and remain shall be caught up. We're living in the hour when those which are dead are going to raise from the grave. And there's a power that's going to raise them. It's the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus. And there's benefits right now today of that resurrection. &gt;&gt; Oh, prophet of God. says here in Bal and Gilead talked about that girl who was dancing across the floor and half naked and all excited about the the music of the the Wildcats playing and everything. And Brother Brandham was talking to a Methodist pastor who couldn't get the people to show up at church. He said, "Uh, I asked I sent out all these cards and they signed all these cards. Will you come to church?" And he says, "Out of 4 or 500 people," he says, "nomely two of them said they would come six months out of the year." And he said, "You know, you know, Bill, what's going on?" And he says, "How do you get those people all up there at your church on Sunday night?" And he says, "Oh, I give them pills." So, I give him pills. He says, "How how do you get them all there on Sunday night?" He says, "I give him pills." And he says, "Uh, what kind of pills?" He was excited. Hey, this might work. He said, "I give him gospels." And you know what he said? He's like, "Oh, well, you haven't lost your southern ideas." He saw he thought it was going to be something new. It was going to be something special. &gt;&gt; But when he found out it was just the gospel, &gt;&gt; he was like, "Oh, &gt;&gt; just the gospel. Just the fact that there's a reality of a supernatural God presence in the church. That's what'll draw the people." He said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me." &gt;&gt; He says, "You know, that man and was asking, you know, how do we get these people to come to church? And what do we do?" And he says, uh, he says, "Well, let me ask you, do you think, Brother Brown, that he says, you'd have to get somebody to to sign a card to to come to that that Wildcat dance there that she was just all excited about?" He's like, "Well, no." He said, "You're right. she'd sell what little clothes she did have so she could make it there. And he says, "If them people loved God like that woman loved dancing, they would be at the church and you wouldn't have any to sign any card to get them there." And that's where the trouble is, brother. The church has lost its zeal, its love for the gospel, for the power, for the Holy Ghost. It's lost it. Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Then why is the daughter of my people not recovered? Oh, brothers and sisters, there is a bomb in Gilead. There is a resurrected Lord Jesus. And he's here this morning to give to you what you have need of. If you are willing to entertain his presence, &gt;&gt; oh, if you can be like that little woman who pushed through the crowd and she pushed past every obstacle and she broke through every barrier until she could get to his feet and pour out her worship onto him, if you can push past every person who would say, "Oh, well, look at you. You're not worthy enough. You're not good enough." She pushed past that. She pushed past every barrier till she could get to him &gt;&gt; because he had what she needed. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you know, you you might say she wasn't worthy, and you're absolutely right, but he was worthy of service. &gt;&gt; He deserved to be made welcome. And is there somebody here this morning that's willing to make him welcome and say, "God, I have a need in my life. Lord, there's things I can't fix on my own. There's situations I don't want know what to do about, but I have a need of you this morning. And I tell you, if you can get to him, if you can get to my resurrected Lord Jesus, his power is just the same as it ever was. &gt;&gt; If he forgave her, he'll forgive you. &gt;&gt; If he healed that woman with the blood issue, he'll do it for you because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let's stand to our feet this morning. &gt;&gt; We're not living in a day of dead, dark denominationalism. But in this last day, there has been a resurrection out of that. There's been a wave sheep waved over the people. We have seen Jesus Christ as the same yesterday, today, and forever. But that wasn't just to let us know that he was alive in 1960, friends. That wasn't just to let us know that he was moving back there. That's to let us know he's here right now today in 2025. He's the same God right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, and whatsoever things you have need of, believe. Believe you will receive them. &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you talking about?" I'm challenging you to release your faith in him. I'm challenging you to believe that he has the answer for what you're dealing with. Oh, do you believe it this morning? Do you truly believe that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead with all your heart? Is that a reality to you? Is it a story book? Or is it a Sunday school teaching you heard one day? Or is it something that's just impulsating in your heart saying, "Lord, I believe. I believe you're here. I believe your presence and I believe that whatsoever I have need of, you're here this morning to meet my need." &gt;&gt; Oh, I challenge you to believe it this morning. Let's just sing that. Let's just sing that. Only believe. Only [Music] believe. All things are possible. Holy, holy, [Music] holy believe. All things are possible. [Music] Jesus is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. All things are possible. Oh, Jesus is here. Oh Jesus is here. Jesus is here. All things are possible. Oh Jesus is here. You know, one time Jesus walked through a multitude of sick folk. He walked up to one person. He said, "Would you may be made well." And that one man was healed and he walked out of there. But there's no record that anybody else was healed. Why? The power was there. The healer was walking through the midst of them. If they would have reached out and took the hip of his garment, there was the power to heal them right there. If they would have cried out, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me." His power was there to heal them, but they didn't recognize him. And because they failed to recognize him, they did not receive their blessing. Oh, but if you'll recognize him this morning, oh, if you'll recognize his presence is here to give to you your desire. Oh, then every whatsoever you have need of is available this morning. Just if if you want to come for special prayer or if you want to kneel down at your chair, if you want to kneel down at altar, I don't care how you go about it. But brothers and sisters, don't miss your opportunity this morning to meet with the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. Let's just sing that again. Jesus is here. Oh, Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Through all things are possible, [Music] Jesus is here. Oh Jesus is here. Oh Jesus is here. Oh, all things are possible for Jesus [Music] is here. &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. [Music] All things are possible. [Music] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. All things are possible. Lord [Music] receive. Lord I believe and Lord I believe. Lord I believe. [Music] are crossing and Lord I believe [Music] and Lord I believe Lord I Impossible. [Music] [Music] Oh, and thank [Music] you for [Music] all my sins. and shame in love. You came and gave amazing grace. Thank you for your love, Lord. Thank you for [Music] wash me in your cleansing flow. All I know for praise worthy is the lamb. See it on the throne. [Music] We crown you now with heavy ground to great victorious. [Music] I am lifted up [Music] Jesus son of God. [Music] The treasure of heaven. Worthy is [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it's hard to &gt;&gt; sell something you don't use yourself. And if you believe he's here, you can't tell somebody that he's risen if you don't touch them yourself. [Music] You know, a a prayer line doesn't work if you don't touch them yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Nobody can touch him for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know that that you've got to touch him. And that's and he said, "If you draw nigh unto me, I'll draw nigh unto you." &gt;&gt; Maybe you could sing that little song. &gt;&gt; So, you know, &gt;&gt; if we don't have room here, you can touch him right in your seat. &gt;&gt; The battle's in the mind. &gt;&gt; You just start fighting in your mind. Will he touch me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If I lift my hand and I admit, will he touch me? Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He will touch you. And if you're not saved this morning, that means you haven't given your life to him. Don't be ashamed to come up and say, you know, I want to give my life to him. &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, if you come unto me in no wise will I cast you out. &gt;&gt; If you got something in your life, you just can't overcome it. &gt;&gt; He already knows what it is. &gt;&gt; He just wants you to touch the hem of his garment. Our brother preached. He's here. Do you believe he's here? &gt;&gt; You believe what he said? Wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, there I'll be. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, he's here &gt;&gt; and he knows everything in your life. &gt;&gt; What you're battling, what you go through, what your weaknesses are, what your trouble is, what what your failures are. He knows every single one of them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; this morning. &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid. &gt;&gt; Nothing hid. &gt;&gt; The question is, do you want to reach your hand and say, "Lord, I want to touch you this morning." Nobody can touch them for you. Don't think about what it is that that you're doing wrong. &gt;&gt; Think about who he is &gt;&gt; and that he died for that problem. He died for that sin &gt;&gt; and he rose up and comes back alive in our presence to fulfill every promise he made to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he said if you're faithful and just to confess your sins, he would be faithful and just to forgive them. &gt;&gt; And he's here to forgive. And you can feel that forgiving power. &gt;&gt; He's here to heal. And he's here to bring that healing to you. If you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and given your heart to the Lord, we have a pool that's open. &gt;&gt; Would you just reach up &gt;&gt; and let him come into your life? There's nothing like it, church. [Music] Oh shackled by a heavenly [Music] burden. Be the Lord app [Music] of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, touch us this morning. Oh, and now I am no longer [Music] [Music] the joy. Oh, reach up and touch him. If you know, touch him. [Music] [Applause] Oh, if he's dealing with your heart, &gt;&gt; you know you're not right with God. You know you haven't given your life to him. You feel him all around you. He's calling you. That's a privilege. &gt;&gt; Why die with a dying generation in a world that's law? Why don't you hear the call this morning, &gt;&gt; Lord? I'm not right. I've got things in my life that's not right. I can't overcome. I'm I'm broken. But the brother said that you were alive. He He testified that he touched you &gt;&gt; and you did something for him. &gt;&gt; Father, I was lost &gt;&gt; so far, but Lord, you touched me. And if you ever been touched, you want somebody else to be touched. All you have to do is slip your hand up to him and say, "Lord, I'm not right. I know I'm not right. But I heard the gospel that you can make me right. &gt;&gt; I don't have to make myself right. that you can touch me &gt;&gt; and forgive me and your spirit can come in my life and joy can make a difference in my heart. And Lord, I'm willing to go to the pool this morning and testify that I was wrong, but I'm going to be baptized in your name for the remission of all my past that I can resurrect new and be filled with your spirit. The gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus. The wages of sin is death. Man is making his choice today. Will you make your choice for him? Don't be ashamed. I know how it feels. That feeling comes all around you and you feel the conviction and you feel the guilt and you it just like every eye in the world's on you. But just lift up past it and say, "Oh God, this morning, &gt;&gt; I know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And I want you this morning." &gt;&gt; Do you do that? &gt;&gt; Don't let this opportunity pass you by. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that sense first. Amen. Oh, since I meant this glad savior. [Music] cleansing me. [Music] I shall never see to praise him. Oh, I shall eternal [Music] touch [Music] me. Oh me [Music] my soul [Music] and I Oh my and [Music] hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember brother Neville told me something that [Music] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said. He said, "David," he said, &gt;&gt; "the minute you make that first move towards him, &gt;&gt; you raise your hand, your heart cries out." He says, "9% of it's already taken care of. &gt;&gt; It's all acceptance." I tell you, there's not. &gt;&gt; There's nothing. &gt;&gt; I always laugh at these liquor stores. They say spirits. &gt;&gt; Why? And we got the best spirit in the world. &gt;&gt; We got his spirit. He loves you. &gt;&gt; If you could if we could ever grasp that God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. He He went to Calvary for you. It's you personally. He knows He knows the anguish of your heart. Just touch them. It's so beautiful when you touch him. And And I I would like if the if it the brothers would before I head overseas. And I can't explain to you in the realms of what's happening. I mean, the brother came today and preached a message. And if you're spiritual, you understand that a few weeks ago, we stood right here and said, "We need to take this church &gt;&gt; and move it towards evangelism." &gt;&gt; And I never talked to him. I mean, last time I saw him, he was the squirt. &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe I he said I gave my testimony at brother Ted said, "Remember that meeting? It was so crowded &gt;&gt; that the the the first person's face was right here. it. But what was it all about? It was all about a God that could do something. &gt;&gt; And there's there's hardly any voices anymore that want to bring pe people back to the reality of the word of God. what the prophet of God was really preaching that he is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; That was his theme. All things are possible only believe. And as our brother said, that's been that has been exchanged for people ruling over God's people. The ministry has inserted themselves in between the promises of God and the people and the people are starving and the light is starting to break. As some brothers could tell you, the idea and the recognition of culture are Spanish believers. You know the culture [Music] of how that the authoritarian leadership will control your life and that you live in fear of the ministry. &gt;&gt; And all along the ministry was only supposed to be your servant. That's right. &gt;&gt; They weren't supposed to lord over you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's like that little blade of grass that gets buried under all that concrete. Eventually, it's got to work its way to the sunlight. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes years to come out from amongst it. But the only thing that causes that grass to make that journey from the beneath that concrete is because there's a sun &gt;&gt; drawing it. &gt;&gt; And there's a s this morning here that's drawing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And maybe you felt that this morning. You felt that pull. Don't shut it off. &gt;&gt; That's right. cuz it'll pull you into the sunlight. And if you think living under concrete's good, you ought to see what it's like living in the glorious sunlight of God. &gt;&gt; A God that cares for you. &gt;&gt; A God that knows what you're suffering, knows what you're going through. One that'll do anything for you. &gt;&gt; I come from a dark place. Even in my testimony, I can't speak of how dark and evil and demonfilled that I was. So in my heart, there's no sin that God can't forgive. There's no place that you can go that he can't reach farther. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's real. and and maybe if the brothers would come lay hands on me uh for my journey, you know, every time I I know that God's going to do something, Satan starts whacking my flesh. You know, he'll do something to discourage me that just pushes me farther. But there's some people that are hungry &gt;&gt; and we just trust that God will do exceedingly abundantly. Brothers, the minister, brothers, any other brothers that'd like to come, just ask the Lord to [Music] What are you excited? Amen. How many's already given their heart to the Lord? &gt;&gt; Is that all, man? We need to have more revival. Is that all the people that's given their heart to the Lord? 1 2 3 5 6 10 &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you been sorry? &gt;&gt; Never been sorry. &gt;&gt; I've never been sorry. We'll see. This is our dismissal song. God bless you this morning. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. [Music] Said Jesus and I've been singing every day [Music] his name. I've never been sorry. [Music] Every moment I found my soul sing. [Music] [Music] Sorry, but I trusted his name. I know [Music] his name. [Music] Oh my soul. [Music] Oh, I wonder his name. Let the sorrow shine. Making my path brightly. I've never been sorry. that I trust in his name. Never I thought of satisfying. Jesus is with me. I've never been sorry. Praise the Lord that I trust in his name. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've never been sorry that I trusted his name. Oh, every moment I find is exactly the same. Oh my soul has been singing since I came. I never been sorry that I trusted his name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Louder. [Music]
