you this morning amen we want to welcome everyone in the house of God Amen I trust you're happy to be in the house of God ton this morning amen um probably see me uh you're surprised that you see me up here probably as surprised as you are um but the David uh flight got cancelled if you if you know anything about what's going on in technology you would know that uh there's a company that took um they said it's about half of the Fortune 500 companies uh down with the was it's supposed to be a security company to protect um and then they made a blunder and it caus the health of the companies to go down and and uh there's many uh uh sector affected Airlines and hospitals and businesses and and all kinds and so uh for that there was uh delays and consolation in flight and Brother David was not able to make it back home so certainly pray that the Lord will uh uh bring him back safe at home um as he was announced but Matthew will be ministering next weekend um I believe believe it's Amaro so he's one of the ministers ministering so those that could go uh we certainly want to go and support our brother um don't forget uh our youth meetings that are coming up on uh August 30th to uh September 1st uh sister April is going to be uh uh just putting up list in the uh in the back for those that could hosting we want to do it like we used to do it before all of this the co and the other stuff happened uh where we had people hosting the youth in the houses and and and and others providing meals and things like that we certainly uh want everybody to participate whatever you can do to help we want this to be a a church effort amen amen it's good to be in the house of God Amen I believe he's going to speak to us this morning how many believe he's going to speak to us amen amen let's open our Bibles this morning uh let's open our Bibles we'll read in uh Matthew chapter 8 let's start from the fifth verse it says and when Jesus entered into kerum uh they came unto him a centurion besting him and saying lo my servant lith at home sick and of uh sick of the py and uh gely tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the Centon answer and said Lord I'm not worthy that that should have come unto my roof man what a humility what a a place to be to of just an understanding even of our Humanity how that it's not supposed to be compatible with deity and and then he says but speak the speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it he said when Jesus heard it he marveled and he said to he said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so so great faith no not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from east and west and shall sit down down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out uh out into the altar darkness and there shall be weeping and graning of teeth and it said and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou has believed so be it be done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame houren let's also uh scroll or turn to uh Romans chapter 828 just some very familiar scripture reading it said and we know that all things work together for the good of them that love God man you love God this morning then all things has to work for the good to them that are they called according to his purpose for who he did for for new he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Breen moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so he's doing the work little by little moving you from one stage to another bringing you into the Perfection again God's work not your work but God's word bringing into Perfection it says who said it says if God be for us who could be against us he that spareth not his own son but delivered him up for us all it says how shall how shall he not with him also freely give us all things it says who shall lay anything through the charge of God's elect it is God that justify who is he that condemned it is Christ that died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh in intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or or sword it says at as it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all the things we are more than conqueror through him that loveth us father we ask that you bless your word through Us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats and as you are seated also turn your Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 uh we're going to read uh uh start from verse 14 it says and unto the angel of the Church of the aysia writes these things sayith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor heart I would that thou would be cold or heart so then because thou are look warm and neither cold nor heart I will spew the out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich and increased with good and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou are rightous and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel Thee I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire that thou mayest be rich white r r rment that thou mayest be closed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke I chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in and will s with him and him with me uh so for just a a a short while here I I want to speak on the word knocking knocking at your door and and for a theme uh I just want to uh uh a reoccurring them that I'll be touching on is the authority of his word the authority of his word so as we read you I want to say this we as Believers we recognize that the word of God is the supreme authority the word of God is the absolute for the believer so when the word speaks we know that that's the end of the matter matter there are no questions to be asked and we spoke about this last time and we even as the the Bible will say in John chapter one that in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and all things that were created were created by the word of God and we understand that it starts with the word of God it ends with the word of God and anything in between will pass away if it if it wasn't the word in the beginning it will not last if it wasn't the word it will not come to an end and and the prophet will tell us that the word is the expression of God thoughts that he had in the beginning and today we are seeing that expression being manifested so as we we we look at the word of God we see foram will say that the spoken word is the Original Seed so the the the the the the very word of God is the seed of God that was so in the beginning that we see today so if it's not part of the The Original Seed it's not going to last and Satan we know throughout the ages or throughout Main's history what he's always tried to do is to inject uh uh uh things in the word of God and make it of non effect is to inject tradition to inject man's thinking to inject something that will cause the word not to produce what God wants it to produce but we understand that if you have the original word you would have the original results if you have the original word you will have the original intent of God manifested in your life so as we read about this servant we just read he I want you to just realize his approached to the word of God so he came and this Roman Centurion he came and and as we read he came he had one of his servant that was sick and no doubt that he loved the servant he was one that was dear to him and he wanted to see him healed that he would not send another servant to call call Upon Jesus but he was take time to go himself because this was a beloved servant of him he will stand up and he will go and he will come to Jesus and as he show as he comes he he and when he begins to speak there's a way you you you look at it and you see that he recognizes that Jesus had the power in his words amen he now he when he comes to Jesus he recognized that this man has the power in what he's saying in other word when this man speaks something happened this man is not just speaking Fain words he just not uh uh H H uh speaking wisdom to man is not not just speaking some intellectual ideas or another way of thinking but in his words when he speaks something happened and and no doubt they had a testimony that perhaps he heard about those that were healed they heard about those that were raised from the dead and and he knew that if Jesus would speak a word that Jesus had the power to cast out demons that Jesus had the power to change circumstances that Jesus words has the power had the power of creation and therefore he humbled himself before the word and said that I know that the power that you hold me being a man under Authority me uh having the understanding of what the structure of authority is that I have servants if I will say go here they will go I have one that is uh uh uh uh under me that I'll tell him go do this they'll go do that I have an understanding by what I see from you that if you will just say one word it will come to pass and I want to say this if this man could come and believe that the word of God the word spoken by Jesus can help him how much more as the sons and the daughters of God how much more we come through the house of the Living God we hear the word of God day in and day out and I want to say this this Faith was manifested in the Bible calls it the faith of the Gentile because when Jesus turned around they looked at him and said I have not seen such Faith No not in Israel so this Faith was characterized as the faith of the Gentile and if you go read the prophet will speak and he said the Jews had the custom that they they were custom to the laying of the hands and they believe that things will happen even just if you were to touch and one will be healed if you were to lay hands on them and pray for them but yet the Gentile they exhibited a certain type of faith that was really not found in Israel so as this man came he had came and he believed that if he could come and Jesus will speak the word that his servant will be healed so he believed that if Jesus word had the power then there had to be something that if the believer will believe it if he would speak and I will believe it something will come to pass and remember as we read the scripture he said that this same Faith was to be manifested he says there will be those that will come from the East and there will be those that will come from the West that will be seated at the feet of Abraham they would manifest the same exact faith and I want to say to us this morning we are called to believe the word of God that it would help us in our times of need we are called to believe and when the word is spoken when Jesus speaks and when we come to the house of God we hear the word of God we are those that are called to believe that what we are hearing will help us in the situation that we are going through amen let me say this if Jesus words has power that when the Centurion came and this Roman Centurion will come and Jesus will speak and the servant will be well how much more this morning because we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his words have not changed his power is not changed if that same Jesus spoke we are sitting here this morning reading the same word of that same Jesus reading the same word the same Jesus spoke and if he spoke the Centurion servant felt well how much more this morning we ought to believe that that same power is in the house of God don't we we we we have to be careful because often time people feel like oh I need the word of God I hear the word of God but I need something more than the word of God let me say there's nothing more than the word of God the word of God is the final say the word of God is what brings the result you say you preach about the word every time there's nothing else to preach about except the word of God oh if we would get the word of God and by Revelation really believe it it would bring about the change that God has promised butam will say in the message life is the Healer uh preaching 57 he will say the idea is not to touch is it isn't to touch me now speaking about himself but it's to touch him he says now America it's very hard to get into them it says they are used to people laying their hands on them and that's right but that was the old Jew custom but the gentle custom was I'm not worthy that for you to come under my roof so he's saying now the Gentile we that are sitting here this morning that have been identified by the word of God as the G Gentile butam is saying that you have to have an approach you and and in you was manifested an approach that was never manifested to the Jew in you there was an approach that you were not born when the prophet was here you you only heard the Ts for you to hear you didn't see brother Bram with your own eyes you didn't touch brother R them with your own eyes but yet within you God has placed an attribute of faith that you will hear the word of God this morning and you will believe it let me not never forget that that's the very Foundation of what you are built upon people go into great meetings and they go to great places they think that it's the preacher that packs the healing it's the preacher that packs the Deliverance but what says that healing is already in you healing is already in The Believer the delance is already in The Believer all the attributes of God if you are a son of God are already in you what we are looking for is for God to Quicken the faith for us to believe that the work is already done let me say this this morning when God gives his word it's a finished work it's not a work that needs for you to add anything to it what we are called upon is to believe upon the finished work of Calvary and know that he who spoke the word is here to bring the word reality the Gentile Faith so he comes in and he says that's not what the Jews or what that's not what the Gentile the that says I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will leave listen to this he knew that the authority of the word cuz he knew the authority of the word cuz he had because he said he was a man under Authority let me say this today if you have children if you have those and young ones and whatever you understand that when you say something they would have to obey you understand that if you work in a company if you are told something to do you would have to obey you understand that there's a structure to Authority for those that are in the military they understand it perfectly you are told to obey and not even to ask questions God is wanting us the children of God to be trained that's why he said we are not in the picnic we are in the army of God so in the army of God is training is believing children not to have doubts on their mind not to be the one that have questions not to question the word of God to come under such Authority and understanding of the structure of authority that when the word speaks it's done it doesn't matter how many symptoms I have it doesn't matter whether I understand what the word says or don't understand but when the word speaks it's all and done so the approach is is is never changed it's the same yesterday today and forever it's not that you come and and God has a different approach God is the same yesterday today and forever it's the devil that tries to confuse you that this is not going to work you need to change your approach no we approach God by one thing and one thing alone and that is by faith faith is the only instrument that's given to the believer to touch God and it says those that come must believe that is the rewarder of them that diligently seek upon him and the scripture says that without faith we cannot please God that's right amen so if we have a need this morning we look for the answer in the word of God we stand upon the word of God and the word the spoken word will produce the result so the word has spoken and as far as a Believer is Con concern it's done I have no questions about it the symptoms may be there I may not see it in the flesh as it spoke Wednesday it's the matter of a heart what I'm looking for is God to work within my heart is God to place within my heart a peace that surpasses understanding is for God to come and change my heart therefore I don't care what happened in the natural I know that he as long as my heart believe him he will bring it to come to place in my flesh amen amen oh this morning let me say this if we can only believe the authority of the word of God or if we can only believe the authority of the word of God the word of God is what brought everything into existence and it's the word of God that will bring you into the image of God the word of God when we are challenged when things are not going well what we do is we begin to confess what the word said we will be when things are not working when you feel like you're falling down you feel like you're not making it what you need to do is to begin to confess the word of God because the word of God is what has the power to change whatever circumstance is to bring it into the word of God so if we are believers then we have to believe the authority of what the word of God say said the word of God said we are seated in Heavenly places right now not tomorrow not yesterday but right now we are seated in Heavenly places now I don't care if you feel like you're sitting on the Pew I don't care if your sight tells you you're sitting on the Pew but if the word of God said you are seated in Heavenly places I believe the word of God more than what my eyes see I believe the word of God more than my my own feeling and in fact says you got to come to a place where you doubt your own doubt where you take your own doubt and say I don't believe this I believe what the word says if God said I'm Healed therefore I'm Healed thank and let me say this only the word of God is true and every man's word is Al liive what a privileged people we are this morning that's why the prophet will say we live so much under our under the priv under our privileges because what we need is to elevate the word of God in the lives what we need is to believe more of his word so we can see more of his manifestation the enemy is trying for you to take the word and mix it with with feelings and with understanding and with with the with intellect and all of that and that's why it's not producing the result but what God is looking for is a people that will believe that if I stand upon the word of God it will produce what God called it to produce amen so now he continues on he says so now that's why we are that's why we are giv that's why we give out prayer cards but says the same quote everyone can everyone that can have everyone can have one each night as the boys give them out it says and now now the main thing if you could put it up the same quote I was reading the main thing is to sit open with an open heart and say Lord Jesus I believe you and I have challenged your faith and I challenge your faith but whatam says you see what happens if you will do that from the deps of your soul not from your intellect from the depths of your soul just take everything away from you say Lord I believe now I have no way at all of knowing who's who and what is what is's going to say but he does it himself it's the sovereignty it says it's it that's a sovereignty I can't make it work so that's that that would be telepathy it isn't that I make it work it makes it works me amen I don't work it so I just look live and believe oh if we can come this morning and say I just I just look I just look I live and I believe he says it I go I put it in practice he says it I walk by it I believe it I do everything that I know as long as I'm obeying and walking by the word of God I know he's going to take care of it so he says we have seen and I want to say this in the generation that we are living in we can truly say that we have seen a son under Authority I I was thinking about this and yes Jesus exhibiting the authority of God's word and he will stand there we know that Jesus was the word and he will stand there and he will speak and it will come to pass and the same God when he when it came time for the manifestation of the son of man we can say that we have seen one who was surrendered completely into the hands of God one who was a member of the Bride because I think that's important often time as people we tend to take Bon him and put him in the in the prophet bracket that is true but we also have to understand that him being a prophet was also member of the Bride because it was the she wave offering as we we've been told that what happened and the things that he did as as the Church of the Living God he was one of the first to come forth in maturity that we have something to look forward to that if we come under the same Authority if we will surrender the same way the same word God can work with us let me say this God didn't call us to just be Beggars and and those that will continually just oh God help me oh God no God is looking for people to come to maturity those that will take the word of God and bring it to pass in their life those that will take the word and know that I have been made for this moment I have been made for this circumstances not one that will say oh let me call the pastor let me call this no but one who can stand and say that I have been put under Authority I have been given the authority of the word of God to speak the word and know that God will back me up amen thank you Jes thank that's where we moving to so we we as the children of God we have to understand God wants us to be completely reliant on him and so if we saw one that came and he spake the word and he said oh I take every spirit in this room under my control let me say there no man has ever spoken like that except the Lord Jesus one that can speak with authority and know that when I speak it has to be the spirit of Jesus Christ and let me say this the same Spirit of Jesus Jesus Christ is in the bride today it's in the bride today that we can say I don't care what's happening I'm taking control of my own body I'm taking control of my own circumstances and the same God will come to my assistance we have seen one spoke squirrel into existence we have seen one speak to Nature and nature obey and you think he cannot make it so you can come to church yeah when you want to go you think he cannot make a way for you to have food on your table when you need it you think he cannot come and and and put clothes on your back and put food on your table and provide for your daily need now remember when bam raised the little fish bam told us that God said it and he spoke to him when he did it is he saw that he can show his people and his children that God cares even about the small things he cares even about the little thing he's the god overall so if he cares about the fish if he feeds the birds and and all the the animal kingdom he looked at job and he says how does the lion get his food when he cries out for his food who give him food now if you can do all of that how much more we that are created In His Image in his likeness how that we we we have needs and the God is not going to answer to our needs yes sir oh brother sister we have we have to come under the authority of the word we have to surrender all and say God I'll take your word despise few I'll take if I go hungry taking your word I'll go hungry believing your word the reason is we're not we're not willing to go all the way we are scared that if we do we're going to fall no if you fall it's going to catch you it's just on the other side waiting for you the problem is we don't want to take the liap of faith we don't want to launch out we're scared if we do something is going to happen let me say this that's why I read the scripture all is things work together for the good of them that love we have to come with an understanding with a belief that if I take him at his word he will make my life come to pass according to his will amen the prophet will say in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever preaching 63 and and now he's comparing the the story of uh gyus daughter with with this Centurion and paragraph 254 he says this he says gyus said come lay hands on my daughter and she will live but the Roman the Gentile said I'm not I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof I I tell you every time time you come closer to the word of God that's the feeling it's like Lord the flesh feels is not worthy but let me say this you're not coming by yourself it's his invitation to you he's telling you come unto me ye that are heavy laden he that wants to change your circumstance he that wants to worship me he that wants to live come unto me and I will give you rest so he says but the Roman the Gentile said I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof he says just speak the word he says is just speak the word is that right it says the the it is the spoken word it is the word spoken the gentille see we should carry out that if the Roman if the Roman it says if the Roman could think of that and the he and the Heathen think about that and the Heathen that had just seen him cuz he know know that Jesus words he said a man under Authority I say to this man goeth and he goeth and to that one come and and and and and come he that he has two cuz he is under me it says what what what was his ident his identifying that every sickness and every disease was under the Commandment of Jesus Christ yes sir he had the authority so it's the application and understanding that Jesus was have the authority to make the change is that as believing children and Son of God this was a heathen he didn't come as a son and the daughter of God he was one who just understood the structure of authority and he received the benefit of it and here me say that how about us children of God yeah we are Sons and Daughters God creating how can we not understand the same structure that exists in the kingdom of God that Jesus Christ let me say this the devil is not greater than God your challenges are not greater than God your trials are not greater than God God is the creator of it all in fact but when says that God harnesses trouble and puts it bits in his mouth to come after you but the same God can come and say you Satan I cast you forth get out of here remember the Satan could not touch job unless God allowed him he was specifically told what he could do and what he could not do and that's your father that we're talking about this morning Blind by marus preaching 57 he says the Romans said I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof but I'm a man with authority when I say to this Soldier go go through that he goeth because he is under my authority and I say to this one you do this you go do this and he does it because he has to obey me he's under me it says what was the Roman doing he was recognizing the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ he was recognizing that this man has deity abiding in him oh I tell you when they spoke about brother Bram they had questions about everything that he preached oh that that's crazy what you're preaching over here that's crazy we don't understand they said how could you say this how could you but one thing they couldn't question was that when he stood there and he spoke when he said God came and backed it up one thing they couldn't question was that this man when he spoke it came to happen they didn't understand his Doctrine in fact they told him that you just don't know your Bible and he looks at them and says I may not know my Bible but I know the Creator real well oh I want to say this morning there has to be a people if he was the chief wave offering we may not know all the Bible but we know the author real well the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and the prophet tells us that deity is is in you tonight let me say this it's either this message is the word of God or it's not the word of God it cannot be anything between and if he says that you are deity is in you then by the authority of the word that deity real is in you oh let let's go let's stop about the questioning of our flesh and our thinking and all of that that's never going to take you anywhere it's only going to bring doubt upon doubt upon doubt what God is looking for from his children is you have heard the word of God if the word calls you son you claim and say I am a son if the word says that deity is in you I don't care I don't care if I don't see it I just know if the word said it the word will put it [Music] there and he says see he said you just speak the word and my servant will live what did Jesus said now I've never seen Faith like this in Israel it says that's what I'm trying to get you people Christ is here so believe it it's that simple Christ is here how many believe Christ is here in this building he's here because you brought him here it's not because of the empty building the seed of God remains in the sons of God the seed you have to believe that as you came here Christ is in you he's doing the good works that he promise he's here to work everything out for your good he's here to work in you so he can bring you in the image that he wants you to do he's here to bring his word a reality to you he he's not in heaven just sitting up there looking down at you no the scripture said that all that was in Christ he poured it into his church and we have to come here and know that every single one of us packs a a part of Christ and as together we come we bring forth his fullness thank so we understand when we preach this morning the purpose is to try to bring us into this reality of the Living God because only by the promises that God made we can understand where we are what what what what we are called to be and coming to the place where we understand that God he he he's not just doing things half-hazard that we are even in this building this morning sitting here for a purpose the prophet will speak and he will say that it's truly as as Believers we have to understand that we we we we're not gathered here to fulfill some men's idea we've gathered here and and this is the thing that I always find and and and I I think it's always important even as we move along for us to every time consider the things that God is doing we you couldn't have the diversity we have in this building this morning outside of the word of God if don't ever forget that because those are the very uh things that that will help you understand that it's God who's putting this together the very diversity we we have different taste we have different Hobbies we have different uh uh uh uh uh uh need we have all kind the the only person who could place this together this morning is God we there there's not a million chance that we could be gathered in the same room the the only reason the the single reason we are gathered together this morning from all the countries from everywhere is because God wants us to be here this morning now if you can understand that then it will help you to understand that if the authority of God made that happen the authority of God is here to impart to you what you have need of this morning it's his authority it's his doing it's his promise it's his Gathering it's him doing the [Applause] work the the challenge is that's why we read the other time said the hardest thing for men to do is to believe in out of man and let me see even say this I'm not adding to the word but the hardest thing for man is even to believe himself that's right to believe that I have been called oh I tell you I look at myself in the mirror every day I go there's no way I could be called but it's not my thinking it's not what I want or don't want it's God's purpose it's the authority of the word bringing forth what God wants to bring forth hallelujah thank you he called Moses Moses had a lot of excuses I can't speak I can't do this I can't after he's done all of that God said that's exactly what I was looking for I wasn't looking for your abilities I wasn't looking for your understanding I just needed a man and I say oh I just want to be a man this morning I just want to be a vessel this morning that will receive the word of God so there has to be if we believe the authority of God this morning the authority of the word then a True Believer has to understand that life the life that we have within our flesh was given to us by God how many believe that Eve said I have received a man of the Lord so we answer the very natural life we can certainly say without an excuse that it came from God and and God gave us the natural life for a purpose and we understand if by the same token that that this this natural life when this natural life is over that's not the end of the believer that's right you still with me don't don't get lost now so if we I'm speaking about the authority of the word so if we understand this natural life was given to us then we understand when this natural life is over it's not the end of us there's another life waiting now that but the only way to obtain to that Idol life when we go don't don't forget this we we going to give an account for the natural life that was given to us every minute of it every second of it what did we spend it on what did we do with it but makes a statement somewhere says if God gave us this natural life then we need to ask ourselves why did he give me this natural life and if I put it to the use that he wanted me to put it because if we're not careful then we run into circumstance where everything that we do we do for this flesh let me say this we are made to be more than just the flesh we are made to live for God we are made that we may live for him this life that was given to you was made so you can live it for the life to come not so you can squander it just for the natural things and this is the authority of that same word is telling you this morning do not focus the natural life to the Natural things but take the natural life and focus it on the Heavenly things because that's the purpose the life was given for so we understand that this natural life is over we are going to give an account for it so so we don't we we we don't believe that we'll be partakers or or or we'll be partakers of the death as the world will be partakers of the death but we believe excuse me but we believe that when this life is over we will have the eternal life so let me ask you this question then I don't know how many of us will be comfortable when we're give an account for this life to talk about how many jobs we had oh God you know there on Earth I had five jobs you know I bought 20 houses oh you know I bought I bought the biggest car or I now even you yourself saying that sounds like that's really not the use for this life your your own Spirit within you right now will testify to yourself that that's not what this life was given to you no I'm not talking just you yourself if you are honest with yourself you will account this morning that am I really is this life really given to me so I can do those things now I that's why I said this morning it's important we realize that God knows that we need bread God knows that we need clothing he knows we need those things but we shouldn't take ourselves and put ourselves outside of the word of God in order to fulfill the natural need what he's wanting us to do is to take his word for every challenge that we have if you need bread God will provide bread you need clothing God will provide clothing whatever you need God will provide as long as you live this life for the life to come than thank we we cannot be toast side and and and and and and be moved by every opportunity that comes around the corner oh you're going to make few more dollars you run for the dollars oh if you leave that job after a year or two you're going to get more money over the side you run over here but you are forg getting the very main thing that the life was given to you for the scripture has an example about the rich man who built bonds and and he is is he his bones grew and he had more well more good and and he went and built bigger bars and the scripture says and and he said oh I have so much I'll just go lay down and rest and now I have to work anymore the scripture says that same night God spoke to him and says fools your soul what if your soul is required of you tonight so you understand by taking our lives and and just running around with it in trying to achieve the things of the world it's not God knows we know we need an education he knows we need those things but what we need to do as children of God is that every decision we make we make it by the word of God the scripture says that if you cannot do it in the name of Jesus Christ do not do it are you doing what you're doing in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going to work in the name of Jesus Christ if you get to a place where it cannot be done in the name of Jesus Christ then you live it out and let me say this you think you'll be missing there's nothing you're missing out there that's right amen right but when I'm speaks about the rumor of Sera and he says this in the message Elijah and the meal offering paragraph 99 he says what do we what it says what do you get there he said what do we do what do we get there it says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all things will be added all things will be added so the priority is under the authority of the word of God I am seeking first his kingdom and all things we re added he says how do I know brother brandham he says how do you know only thing I know put God first and move all that's all I know what how is it going to work I don't know how it's going to work out all I know is I'm putting God first s sacrifice mix the oil mix word and spirit together lay yourself upon the cross and say Here I Am Lord put God first in everything for thou sayith the Lord the Cru will not run dry neither will the barrel go empty until the Lord the day that the Lord God sent rain upon the Earth she knew then that that was the prophet of God speaking to her I want to ask you this morning do you know that this message is the prophet of God speaking to you and if you obey the same instruction God that provided for this woman will provide for you this morning she knew then that she was hearing from the prophet I ask you this morning she knew that the prophet has the authority of the word of God that what the prophet spoke will come to pass do you know that you have the authority of God by the word that the prophet has spoken in this same time generation that if you hear the same word the same Prophet speaking God will come and back it up the same God every time the same yesterday today and forever the authority of the same word not another word not a different word Jesus Christ the same yesterday forever if Jesus was yesterday what he did yesterday in fact bam says the very attribute the very Cornerstone of the whole Bible is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday what he did yesterday a Believer can take and stand upon it and know that I am standing upon the word and he will do today what he did yesterday what a place we can stand this morning oh my oh how her heart must have jumped she ran in and made the little cake and brought it out to him and water trembling Trembling Hands over that old sunken she uh cheeks and she knew that God had come to the rescue oh my brother my sister over the little piece of bread she knew that God has come to the rest God will come to the rescue when you apply his word God will come to the rescue when we take him at his word when we believe that I am under the authority of the spoken word let me say this I want to say this our number one purpose here on Earth is to live for him I I I could go quote after quote but I think we we we we know the message this is the entire message we live for him we we everything we do we do for him we do what pleases him in the message the hand the handwritings on the wall paragraph 33 and skip just some for the sake of time the purpose of the earth is to live for him butam says I said that's very nice and he's talking about a man that he met in Idaho who was Raising Hogs and and he was telling brother him he said that I raised Hogs and he said my grandfather has read uh had uh this heard and he educated us children and and some became uh uh and and and some at the same at the same her and he said I've educated my children and my children come up and educated their children with the same herd and and the same uh raising Hogs but when I answered him and he said now I said that's very nice sir that's that's a legitimate job it says is to raise the stock but I said did you know that God put you on Earth here on Earth put you here for some other purpose beside raising Hogs to educate your CH to raising Hogs to educate your children God put you here to be a son and a daughter of God and if you fail to get that you fail to receive the very purpose God placed you here on Earth that's right now that's the prophet speaking so he's saying telling this man if you fail to understand by the authority of God of the spoken word that God plac you here to be a son and a daughter of God and you have you have your Hogs and you have this uh uh precise structure that seemed to work over and over you done all of this and you did good and and that's wonderful you helped your family for generations to come and you set up a chain that can unlimited wealth per se that's wonderful but if if you fail to be a son and a daughter of God you fail to it he says no matter how honest now think about this now he he's really drilling down to to to make us understand this he says no matter how honest how decent how moral you might be how good you might be What a fine sociable fellow you might be you you it says you still miss the calling unless you serve the Lord and become son and the daughter of God no matter how good a neighbor you might be how good of anything you might be he says that's all good we appreciate that but brother until you become a Son of God you fail to answer the purpose that God put you on Earth that's right now that's the word of God speaking that's the prophet speaking so if we can come this morning we say I have been place here on Earth to be a son and a daughter of God he he wants me to bring forth the seed of predestination that was in the beginning and every single one of us that's here says that you play a role in the kingdom of God and he told you that nobody can take your place you are here for a purpose you are here to touch a people that nobody else can touch you are here to do a work that nobody else can do you in your particular way of being God created your for a purpose that's the authority of God word speaking to you and it says I don't want it says and if God done that I want to say this I don't want to fail the mission that God placed me here on Earth for amen I know my redeemer liveth butam says paragraph 12 584 and 6 he says no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are I love this it's like he covers all the circles so you don't have a way of Escape he he locks you in I love that you know we have we have this mind that likes to find an Escape right that someone will be speaking you looking for an escape no when the prophet says Encompass you you know you lock in you know you are done so he speaks and says how important how an important you are you are here to serve a purpose it says just as your finger is here to serve a purpose your nail on your finger is here to serve a purpose it says uh and and it says my eyes every part of my body is here to serve a purpose and and let me just say here before I go on it's important that's why I want to say this this morning uh your mouth was given to you so you can speak good news amen and not to gossip and not to speak bad about people it's good to you to spread good news it's not to take this over here and go tell it over there it's not to take this and dramatize it and add your own salt and pepper to it it's given to you to speak good news to encourage your hands was given to you to help when someone need help you go use your hand to help it wasn't given so you could just make money and pocket for your own self so you can take care of your own body your feet is given to you to spread good news every part of you is given to you for the purpose of serving God not serving the devil we we we we we we become expert you know in in in in propagating the news did you hear did you see what happened it's none of our business didn't Jesus tell Peter he said what is it to you you if it terries until I come follow that me the the Salvation is an individual Affair don't they says a good soldier doesn't entangle himself in the Affairs of the world a good soldier knows what his mission is what he's been called to do and he does what he's been called to do he doesn't go around trying to tell the news what of whatever no he's only focusing one thing that I am called to propagate good good news am he says and and it wasn't he says and it wasn't put here just so you see what it would be what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it says it was God's divine plan to do so now keep this in mind now that's why I'm saying the authority of the word he's telling you this is a divine plan it says and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing that can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until the purpose that God put us on on Earth has been made manifest no matter how much trouble hallelujah oh we we you know it's like some of us you know trouble loves you you know you know it's like man I can't live a life free of trouble it's like everywhere you turn there's trouble you know the enemy is just stirring up trouble you know you come over here there's trouble you step over here they TR you can't put out enough fires so here's the prophet here to encourage you this morning he says no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches we have how much sorrow that we go through he says all these are reasons and there's a reason for it so we have to know that I have been placed here for a purpose I don't care how much trouble I go through I don't care what trouble the devil raises I'm here by the authority of God word to serve a purpose and I'm going to do it anyhow than paragraph 19 it says oh God he says oh and and and he says how that coincide this morning with faith I think it's the same message let me just check sorry I just crawled a little bit too fast yes I know my redeemer liveth uh 5846 he says oh how th coincide this morning with with uh uh with the faith the Living Faith of the Living God is in his church amen not out there in his church there is something in our heart that speaks that there's a land beyond the river I cannot put my finger on that on that land and Nether Nether any any nether can any man it says but there is something within us that tells us that the that the grave is not it's not its goal it says dust are thust are thou thust return was not not spoken to the soul that's right so you understand he that the purpose is you understand that this this flesh is dust it will go unto death but beyond outside of this dust there's a soul that's called to go back to where it came from and that that that Soul didn't come from dust it came from God therefore he goes back to God and he continues on it says there's something within us a fire that's burning a light that's been L by God no Breeze can blow it out there's no cold spell in the church there's no uh indifference among the people no uh persecution of the world that can blow us the that can blow out a flame that God has as has led for it says for it's God's purpose that his torch of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord right God will have a weakness on Earth it's his purpose that the flame will continue to blow is the election is he's choosing that the flame will continue on it says and no power can blow it up they will only make it burn brighter as they blue as they blow thank you Lorden it has been proven Through the Ages that persecution strengthens the church and I want to ask this morning can we really claim not to be true that when persecution come you know butom talks about the the the the wind blowing it says what it does to the tree it says when the wind blows it says the tree will move it will move but in the movement what it's going to do is it's trying to insert its root right back into the ground so it can get a stronger firm so it can stand up and be more stronger than he was before it's all it's doing its positioning to know that I have been placed here to remain the wind is not going to blow me off the devil with all his attack is not going to ble off I'm placed here to serve the purpose of God and whatever happens I'm standing upon the rock am oh oh my the word of God to the believer is the medicine that Health all things the word of God is the medicine that we need this morning I don't know perhaps what we go through on a daily basis but often time regardless of the challenges all you need to do is take your word and the Bible and begin to read and listen it starts to provide Comfort to your heart that's right God began to answer your problems and he began to reassure you that I'm with you I'm walking with you when we have when if we feel sick this morning whether it be natural or spiritual sickness what we need is to take the remedy of God's word and apply it to our sickness what talks about the Limestone it says what they did is they took the the the sheep and they will take all of them and they will bring them and then they will sprinkle honey on the rocks and it will come on the Limestone and said when it came and they knew that there was medicine in there all they needed to do was begin to leak the honey and in doing it they were collecting the limes that were there to heal them if you don't eat the word of God you shall really be sick if you don't take the word of God you shall surely sick but if you are sick this morning you take the word is the pro is the provision for healing for you it's given to you to heal you both naturally and spiritually is given for the healing to the church now let me I was thinking but what I'm talks about here he he says this and and I just hope I can come even uh uh to to some place where I can get to to the end he says this in God's gifts always find a place he says 63122 paragraph 41 he says what does it teach us here before we hit our next test it says here's what it teaches us that God can use every faculty of our being if it's committed surrendered to him he can use our minds our dreams our subc conscience our first conscience our tongue Our Song Our Eyes our everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God am amen so we we just spoke about the authority of God's word now he inserting an element of commitment that is required an element of surrender that is required for the authority to be manifested and it it continues on it says everything that you are committed to God he will use every Outlet every part of you he will use it no matter what it is he will use it if it's sacrificed to the purpose and the calling now listen to this the word committed or to commit means to promise to give to to promise or give your your loyalty time or money to a particular principle person or plan of action let me read it again when you say you are committed to something when you say I'm committed to this what you're saying is I promise to give my loyalty my time my money to a particular principle person or plan of action to pledge or bind to a certain course or policy amen is that really what we're doing to surrender is saying here it's given it here is saying that to surrender means to agree to stop fighting now this is Dr Google you know I've been using Professor Google lately you know I and I and I I I tell people if I get a job and there's no access to Google I won't be able to do my job to surrender is to you agree to stop fighting hiding resisting Etc because you know that you will not win or succeed now I I I I'm hoping by reading this it helps us understand what kind of contract what kind of relationship is expected of us by the Lord is to agree to stop fighting hiding or resisting because you know that you will not win or succeed so when you surrender you know I've given up there's no way for me to win Paul it's again it's hard to kick against the pre I you could try all you want you're never going to win this because the purpose of God will stand no matter what as we said it so now we're saying that we have to come for this uh uh uh contract to work for this relation relationship to work of the authority of God in your life you have to the the more you surrender or the quicker you surrender the more the commitment will work the more you will give in the more you will commit to it God will come and bring it to pass he's looking for people that will completely buy into the plan that he has for them he looking for people that can come and say God has a plan for us amen we no matter what we have need of this morning and let me say this not not just need as far as our Natural Body because most of the time when we talk we think about our natural need I'll say there both natural and spiritual he knows about it and he's taking care of it so what we need uh to come in is to say I have been told that in the end time God will come and bring people that will be even like him he will bring us into immaturity so therefore I have to me to the plan that he has in store for us so I can come into that maturity maturity is not going to come by me kicking against the prick the maturity is not going to come by me opposing the plan the easier I give in the more quicker I get to the plan how many times we've heard the prophet say oh forgive your foolish servant oh forgive your you know because he he he came to a place where sometimes God will tell him to do something he will miss completely the picture of what God was trying to do then he happens and then God will rearrange and then he realize oh that's what he was trying to get me to do this and we as Believers we have to be in tune with the plan of God we have to be in tune with the achievement that God is trying to do because the only way for us to obtain as quick as we want to the plan to get to where God wants us to do is by surrender and commitment we we said Wednesday we live in a time where nobody wants to commit to anything right Christianity is I will go to church when I please when my body wants to come to church I will do this when I want to do it I'm a Maverick I operate by my own self I don't want any leadership over every I don't want anybody to be over me the holy spirit is given to be over you not a man I'm not talking about a man over you I'm talking about under the authority of the word of God we we live in a time where you ask now it doesn't happen you run away you you do this and and it doesn't it doesn't quickly happen oh it's taking too long we God is looking for soul we said we talked about perseverance one who heard the word of God and he knows in his heart that if God spoke it God will bring it to pass if his heart H the word of God they will continue marching until it comes to pass perseverance is not when you have seen it perseverance is to know that he who told me it's going to happen will bring it to pass thankes let me say this persevering is the process of weeding out the quitters those that don't see it because they will walk but if they continue not to see it they'll get discouraged oh it doesn't exist right but to the Believers they know that every step of the way they'll be like Shadrach mishak and Abad go it said that we will not bow our God is able to deliver us and even if he doesn't even if it doesn't we're still going to go whether God shows me he doesn't show me I'll still keep going if God shows me wonderful if he doesn't show me as long as it is in his word I'll stand by it and I'll believe it until the end because when I fall he will touch me perseverance is the total opposite of the self-preservation we like to self-preserving it for me how is this going to benefit me how is this really going to advance my cause how is this me me me me isn't that the thing about Lysa we just read it said that people's right people's age where they stand it's about personal right but he said well a lamb is one who has surrendered his right one who's completely Comm committed to the cause of Christ one who's taken his own rights and give it it says not my will but your will remember he says the same relationship that existed between God and Christ it will have to exist between Christ and the bride amen amen if the musician could come and I want to say this what one I'm said in question and answers it says question and answer preaching 59223 paragraph 1 123 123 it says before the world before there was a world you were in God's Tau to give you the Holy Ghost I love that I love that I wish that every believer every time you feel like you don't have the Holy Ghost you go read this it would help you amen am before there was a world you were in God's thought to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew that you'll be wanting it and he chose you himself because you desired he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus or any of you or any of you was on Earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself thank you Jesus now I don't understand that plan that's just way way past so even before Jesus Is manifested God it himself is knowing that this person is going to need the Holy Ghost but for him to get the Holy Ghost I'll need my son to die and if my son to die then I'll make a way for him to come oh goodness that is so wonderful that is a mathematical equation we cannot understand 10 that's just one thing we need to believe that God has it under control thank you Jes he's worked it out for your good he says oh I know it says I I I know I may this says this is the church it says so I'm at home now it says this is so reach to me I think it's what I wanted it says it was wasn't my desire it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I had not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God saw us and put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a world talk about talk about God you it says and let me say this that's why it's important when we come to the house of God we we are here to fulfill the purpose that God plac us here and if God plac us here that means he had everything line up everything predestinated everything line up for us to receive this end time message he he says in the natural he put this together that together so you could become so now he's telling you in the spiritual that the purpose that I was making even the holy spirit in existence was so that when you come he knew that you would need it and you would receive it let me say this the end time commission and our responsibility is for us to spread the good news of what Jesus has done for us God wants you this precious message this precious gospel that we have received God don't want it to just be ourselves he want us to spread it into the whole world to those that have not heard it before to those that are struggling in sin and things and to those that don't know that there's a God who can do this to those that don't understand that there was a predestination where God in the beginning was working out everything for your good for those that are out there of the seed of God that have not come in contact with him God wants your life to Manifest this gospel so therefore we have not received it so we can just say we thank God for the message we have received it the purpose for it is so we can become the message so we can spread the message amen but one them says oh what God is looking for is lived voices if Jeffersonville could only have lived voices in other words those that have received the message and they have become the very message those that can go and spread it into all the world and they will tell it to their neighbors they will go to work and everywhere families and wherever they are where the lies become the very reflection of what Jesus is doing let me say that that's your purpose for existence and I'm saying that under the authority of the word of God thank you Lord don't never forget that what says the scripture will say the word will say you will go and people will ask you what is it that makes you happy why aren't you sad and the economy is failing and inflation is going up and and the buying power is going down and all of that now if you are complaining with the world how are you going to spread the good news if you are there at the gas station complaining just like the next guy man I can't believe we can't afford this anymore and I can't believe the groceries is going up and I can't believe how is it you're spreading the good news I think we have to be mindful of what we are put here but one of them says you go to a place it says when someone will say oh oh you know I have a person he says it's sick and the doctors have given this and they've given a bad report and you turn around and say I know a God who can heal them that's how you worship him that's the spreading of the good news you are at work and somebody is just losing it I can't believe this job oh I can't believe this world and everything say well you know I know of another kingdom that is to come when this one is over there's another one to come if you want to come through it I invite you to believe my God he's able to do for you how are you going to do it if you are complaining with a [Music] complainer have we not understood that we have a God who promised to take care of our need have we not understood that we have a God who before you came he predestinated everything he promised to take care of all your needs don't we understand that we have a message to give to the world and our message is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and whatever need is out there you bring it into the house of God there's a God here who's able to make himself a reality to those that are looking for him don't be afraid let me say this it's not for you to prove him to prove him it's for him to prove his word to be true you met a sinner you meet one who's going through difficulties but but I'm said you worship Him by looking and them say you know you don't have to live that way that's right you know you don't have to continue in sin you know you don't have to be bound by alcohol or drug or whatever it is that you are you know there's a living garden and perhaps you is one that perhaps in the same situation that you were in and you can look and say you know I was a drug addict too oh I was a drunker too but I meant to Living God I meant the Living God I didn't meet just the God but I me the god of the Bible the one who wrote his word and he came and he changed my life and I'm here to testify to you that if you will believe that same God he will do for you the same that he did for me that's the testimony of the believer that's what you were place here on Earth for is to continue the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to spread good news is to live for him is so that your life can become his reflection [Music] Hallelujah sometimes we take these things and we just eat it ourselves and we rejoice in it and my goodness we just fat in the word I say we need a little exercise we need a little application we need a little and and God will Quicken it to your heart but you know but talks about going to I believe it was a museum or something or where a person looked at a a whale and said oh look at this whale and they say that swallowed Jonah and if you measure here and you measure there there's no way a man can fit in there he said I was just walking and I couldn't stop myself oh I hope this morning if we can't stop ourselves you hear the word of God I don't care what your circumstance is I don't care what your situation is if you know of one that's in the circumstance the moment they start spewing negativity you say I can't stop myself but to talk about a living God he said sir pardon me but that's not the same thing fish the Bible says it was a special prepared fish that swallowed Jonah oh it's the same no that one was specifically made for one Mission and one Mission alone that one could swallow a man no other whale could swallow a man except this one that's the kind of God we're living in that's the kind of God we serve this morning is one who will come to your particular circumstance you the doctor says nobody has ever seen a case like this science says this doesn't exist yes it never existed but this particular circumstance there's a God who can come to this one he does it just for one circumstance it's the same yesterday today and forever God bless you let's all stand this [Applause] morning it's the authority of the Living God of the word acting into the believer I say let the authority of the power lift you up it's knocking at your door this morning remember we read that scripture and forgive me I didn't get there but that's okay he's knocking at your door this morning he wants you to believe and accept the authority of his word but when it says in the lodan church ages Jesus was put on the outside and he there continually knocking he said anybody else if you knock if he knocks and you don't answer they will go away but not this God every time the gospel is preached he's there knocking to the door of your heart will you allow the word into your heart he said we have many doors into our lives into our hearts he's wanting Act access to
