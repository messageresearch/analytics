[4:52] we're certainly glad to have you with us
[4:54] amanda's invited by the mic for so i'm
[4:56] reading this morning god bless you
[5:17] you know i think we've talked before
[5:21] about how the book of psalms is so much
[5:24] like
[5:25] kind of getting a little bit of a
[5:26] glimpse into the prayer diary of
[5:29] a great warrior of the faith david
[5:33] you know when i was reading the other
[5:34] day and it occurred to me that we
[5:37] we have a a tendency to read the stories
[5:40] of these old bible heroes
[5:42] you know david moses
[5:45] abraham some of these others and
[5:49] you know they they tend to become larger
[5:51] than life
[5:52] we tend to kind of lionize them or raise
[5:54] put them up on a pedestal as
[5:57] almost like they're supermen like they
[6:01] have a walk or they have a you know they
[6:03] had a
[6:04] an existence that is so much higher
[6:07] so much greater so much unattainable
[6:11] to us you know i think that's how the
[6:14] human mind works
[6:16] and that's you know the devil is a
[6:18] master at manipulating the human
[6:20] mind but you know one of the traps is we
[6:23] tend to look at individuals who
[6:26] god has been able to perform a work in
[6:28] or perform a work through
[6:31] and somehow put that out of reach well i
[6:34] can't happen to me because that was
[6:37] abraham because that was
[6:40] david you know we
[6:43] we'll sit here and we look at all these
[6:45] great experiences that they have and
[6:48] how could that ever be how could i ever
[6:50] have
[6:51] have a walk like that but what we don't
[6:54] see we forget
[6:55] is is that between each of these
[6:58] testimonies
[7:00] each of these events there's a time
[7:02] between those testimonies that
[7:04] we don't necessarily see you know if you
[7:08] look in the scriptures for example at
[7:09] the mighty hero of faith noah
[7:12] the entire the entire events that we
[7:17] read about in
[7:18] the bible about him occurred in the
[7:20] space of about one year
[7:22] out of 950 years that he lived
[7:26] you look at somebody like abraham who's
[7:28] a great father of the faith
[7:30] and if you look at each one of the
[7:32] events taken together it might be
[7:34] 30 some odd days of incidents recorded
[7:38] over his span of 175 years
[7:42] you know even jesus who is tempted in
[7:45] all points
[7:46] such as we are the scriptures only
[7:50] capture just
[7:51] really a handful of days and weeks
[7:54] out of his lifetime
[7:59] but you know the rest of that time is
[8:00] that time between the testimonies
[8:03] the time that they just had to walk
[8:07] the regular life which is
[8:10] not so different than ours
[8:14] you know what i like about psalm 28
[8:16] we're going to look at that this morning
[8:19] is it gives us a glimpse into that
[8:22] time between the testimonies
[8:26] for david you know we don't know
[8:31] what it was he was struggling with as
[8:33] he's
[8:35] crying out before the lord doesn't
[8:38] really go into specifics about what his
[8:40] need was at that hour
[8:43] but what you can tell is he had a need
[8:47] and it says in verse 1 it says unto thee
[8:49] will i
[8:50] cry o lord my rock be not
[8:54] silent to me lest if thou be silent
[8:59] to me i become like them that go down
[9:02] into the pit
[9:05] you know regardless of what his need was
[9:06] david was crying out to the lord for one
[9:09] thing
[9:10] that he might hear from him that he
[9:13] might hear a word
[9:15] from the lord and that really is the one
[9:19] thing here that
[9:20] makes him different from everyone else
[9:23] is
[9:23] is that he had a desire to hear that
[9:26] word
[9:28] and he cried out for it in verse 2 he
[9:31] says hear the voice of my supplications
[9:34] when i cry unto thee when i lift up my
[9:37] hands toward
[9:38] thy holy oracle
[9:41] you know that word oracle there in the
[9:43] hebrew refers to the place where god
[9:46] dwells and speaks
[9:48] and even webster's dictionary says it's
[9:50] a it's a place
[9:53] a shrine if you will in which
[9:56] deity reveals hidden knowledge
[10:00] or divine purpose i thought that was
[10:03] pretty good that it used the word
[10:04] reveals
[10:07] you know there was that place that david
[10:09] sought
[10:11] that he could lay hold of him and hear
[10:14] the word that he needed in his hour
[10:18] for his knee and that was the cry
[10:21] of his heart that's what he was asking
[10:24] for
[10:26] and that's a glimpse at the time between
[10:29] the testimonies that every single one of
[10:31] these individuals in the scriptures had
[10:34] they had a need and they laid it before
[10:36] him with the expectation that they might
[10:38] hear from him
[10:40] because they knew when they heard from
[10:42] him that word that thus saith the lord
[10:44] it was as good as done
[10:48] you know it's if we finish out
[10:51] psalm 28 there's a turning point
[10:54] somewhere between verse 5
[10:56] and verse 6 where he received what he
[10:59] was looking
[11:00] for his crying out to the lord
[11:04] turned into verse 6 blessed be the lord
[11:07] because he hath heard the voice
[11:09] of my supplications my heart trusted in
[11:13] him verse 7
[11:14] and i am helped you know he got to that
[11:17] need in that day-to-day walk
[11:19] that time between the testimonies that
[11:21] time between the great events
[11:23] where all he did was go before the lord
[11:25] that he might hear thus saith the lord
[11:27] for his knee
[11:28] and he cried out to the lord and when he
[11:30] got it it was as good as done
[11:33] that's the that's the time between the
[11:35] testimonies did it was it true that
[11:36] these men
[11:37] of the scriptures these great heroes
[11:39] might have had something that others
[11:41] didn't have yeah
[11:42] they did they had thus saith the lord
[11:44] and that's no different than anyone here
[11:46] in this room
[11:47] you know we're no different than them
[11:49] and that time between the testimonies
[11:51] where we lay it before the lord that we
[11:52] might hear
[11:53] thus saith the lord for our need for our
[11:56] time
[11:56] for our hour and when we hear it it's as
[11:59] good as done
[12:00] it's just a matter of time at that point
[12:02] let's go ahead and read psalm
[12:04] 28 together you know as an example
[12:08] of the time between the testimonies
[12:10] which
[12:11] hopefully will sound familiar to all of
[12:13] us let's read that together
[12:15] unto thee will i cry o lord my rock
[12:19] be not silent to me lest if thou be
[12:22] silent to me
[12:23] i become like them that go down into the
[12:26] pit
[12:27] hear the voice of my supplications when
[12:29] i cry unto thee
[12:31] when i lift up my hands toward thy holy
[12:33] oracle
[12:34] draw me not away with the wicked and
[12:37] with the workers of iniquity
[12:39] which speak peace to their neighbors but
[12:41] mischief is in their hearts
[12:43] give them according to their deeds and
[12:46] according to the wickedness of their
[12:47] endeavors
[12:48] give them after the work of their hands
[12:51] render to them their desert
[12:53] because they regard not the works of the
[12:55] lord
[12:56] nor the operation of his hands he shall
[12:59] destroy them
[13:00] and not build them up blessed be the
[13:02] lord
[13:03] because he hath heard the voice of my
[13:05] supplications
[13:06] the lord is my strength and my shield my
[13:09] heart
[13:10] trusted in him and i am helped therefore
[13:13] my heart greatly rejoices and with my
[13:16] song will i praise him
[13:18] the lord is their strength and he is the
[13:20] saving strength of his anointed
[13:23] save thy people and bless thine
[13:25] inheritance
[13:26] feed them also and lift them up forever
[13:34] amen god bless you i have your seats
[13:39] man that's it that's why we praise him
[13:41] that's what we're seeing

[44:33] revelations and to the 20th
[44:38] verse and so
[44:44] and if we would have a title
[44:47] today um for what's on our heart
[44:52] to share with you it would be called the
[44:54] cry to overcome
[44:56] the cry to overcome and
[45:01] and we're going to go about it kind of
[45:03] in a long way so if you stay with me
[45:05] we'll
[45:05] we'll get there we may not be long we
[45:08] may be long
[45:09] i don't know i do have a few brothers
[45:13] that i know are always longer in me so i
[45:15] take great comfort
[45:17] in them so but
[45:21] anyway i just about my trip my mother's
[45:25] just doing wonderful
[45:27] she'll be 99 in july and
[45:30] you know i walked around the block with
[45:32] her and she
[45:34] walks up i don't know almost a quarter
[45:36] half a mile every day and
[45:38] she still cooks for herself and for me
[45:40] so
[45:41] it's really uh marvelous that
[45:45] god's been good i i can look down the
[45:48] road and
[45:49] you know i don't know how many years she
[45:52] has but i
[45:53] know she doesn't have many years ahead
[45:55] of her as she does behind her
[45:58] and i hope the same is for us when it
[46:00] comes to the rapture
[46:01] amen let's read these scriptures this
[46:03] morning
[46:05] behold i stand at the door
[46:10] and knock do you believe god's doing
[46:13] that
[46:13] i do if any man hear my voice
[46:18] and open the door i will come
[46:22] in to him and will sup
[46:25] with him and he with me
[46:30] to him that overcometh
[46:34] will i grant to sit with me
[46:37] in my throne even
[46:40] as i also overcame
[46:44] ammon set down with my father
[46:47] in his throne he that hath an ear
[46:50] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[46:53] unto the churches and so this is the
[46:57] question to him
[46:58] that overcometh will i grant to sit with
[47:02] me
[47:02] in my throne therefore i feel in our
[47:06] hearts we have a cry
[47:08] to overcome father bless your word to us
[47:11] this morning in jesus precious name we
[47:13] pray
[47:14] amen god bless you may be seated
[47:22] uh
[47:29] the cry to overcome
[47:33] and you know i believe in when i
[47:37] talk with people and even
[47:40] within my own self uh
[47:43] i i there's just something within our
[47:46] hearts i hear it from everybody
[47:49] that we want to do better we want to be
[47:52] closer to god we uh
[47:56] we want to have victories that
[48:00] in in our lives and and we want to
[48:03] overcome or we want to conquer
[48:07] or climb above the places that we are
[48:12] and we know the scripture tells us that
[48:15] sin
[48:15] so easily besets us in other words a lot
[48:20] of times we end up
[48:22] returning back to the things that we've
[48:26] come out of
[48:27] and we have a term for that and that's
[48:30] called to back
[48:31] slide and what backslide means
[48:35] is to return to old ways
[48:38] and to return back
[48:42] to things that we've previously
[48:46] done sort of like these many lazarus
[48:49] resurrections that we
[48:51] have in our lives you know where all of
[48:53] a sudden we decide that
[48:54] we're gonna do a start all over again
[48:59] and we find out that turning a new leaf
[49:03] never works so we want to talk this
[49:06] morning about what does
[49:07] work i want to overcome
[49:11] and i realized that the prophet of god
[49:13] addressed this
[49:15] in several different services
[49:18] one of the messages he preaches is how
[49:21] can i overcome
[49:23] and he said in that message he said it's
[49:26] not
[49:27] what you overcome it's how that you
[49:29] overcome
[49:31] and so we're going to
[49:34] approach it this morning through the
[49:37] sermon
[49:38] called a man running from the presence
[49:43] of the lord and we'll listen to 17
[49:46] minutes of that but
[49:48] i want us to understand that the
[49:51] cry to overcome
[49:54] is not something that we create within
[49:57] ourselves
[49:59] and so i i don't know if you can find
[50:01] this on the
[50:02] uh on the computer and post it on the
[50:06] board i don't have the paragraph number
[50:09] for it
[50:10] but it's in the message uh
[50:13] the easter seal and uh
[50:17] brother branham makes this a statement
[50:21] and i want to read it slowly to you
[50:24] so that you can think of it in the
[50:27] increments
[50:28] that it's placed out there i really
[50:31] believe that brother brandon ministers
[50:33] in building blocks
[50:35] that he lays something down and if he
[50:38] can establish that in your heart in your
[50:41] mind
[50:41] he will build upon that and and you say
[50:45] well does he do that well the scripture
[50:47] says word upon word
[50:49] lying upon line so that you've got to
[50:52] have a firm
[50:53] foundation to build your life in
[50:56] and that's what the mental battle is and
[51:00] the battle we fight
[51:02] the battle is for the foundation
[51:05] that you build on the scripture says
[51:08] every man buildeth but let every man
[51:10] watch what foundation he builds on
[51:13] because without a firm foundation the
[51:16] building
[51:16] won't stand the scripture refers to it
[51:20] as untempered mortar and so
[51:23] even with our young people and people as
[51:26] they develop
[51:26] and they're developing their thinking
[51:29] their likes
[51:30] and their taste there's a battle for
[51:32] that foundation
[51:34] what you're going to build on the
[51:36] principles that you're going to set
[51:38] in your heart and of course our hearts
[51:42] desire as ministers
[51:43] and as brothers and sisters and as a
[51:46] body we want our foundation to be the
[51:48] word of god
[51:50] because the word of god is what keeps us
[51:53] all equal
[51:54] there's no big eyes no little use no
[51:56] bond nor free
[51:58] june or greek male nor female in christ
[52:01] jesus for we are all his and he is gods
[52:06] and and so if we can have the understand
[52:09] that this is the battle in the mind is
[52:12] the fight
[52:13] for what you're going to build on so if
[52:15] satan can put a complex in your life
[52:18] then you start building your whole life
[52:20] upon that complex
[52:23] you know i mean everything about you
[52:26] someone could make you self-conscious
[52:28] in your whole life you live to be
[52:30] self-conscious
[52:32] you know what i'm saying and and uh so
[52:35] it
[52:35] it it this this battle is always going
[52:39] on but i i really honestly
[52:42] feel that there's there's a cry
[52:45] in the church to overcome
[52:49] and i believe this cry is caused by
[52:52] something so this is what the prophet of
[52:54] god said
[52:55] he said the holy spirit today
[52:58] is hunting out honest
[53:02] hearts that will believe
[53:05] that message so
[53:09] in other words we we have to understand
[53:11] that the holy spirit is hunting
[53:14] okay so you know you understand what you
[53:17] do when you hunt
[53:18] you look for something you track it down
[53:22] you find it okay so if i could say it
[53:26] this way this morning the holy
[53:28] spirit is after you
[53:32] amen he is going to hunt you down
[53:36] we go hunting and we set up camp and
[53:39] and and then we get out on our
[53:41] binoculars and we look over the hills
[53:44] and
[53:44] see if we can find the game and then we
[53:47] walk through the woods you know like
[53:49] this just
[53:50] hunting down you know and and to sneak
[53:53] up
[53:54] well he don't need to sneak up on you
[53:58] okay so he's coming after us
[54:02] okay so what we don't want to do is we
[54:05] don't want to what
[54:07] run and this is this message
[54:11] is running from the presence of the lord
[54:14] a man running from the presence of the
[54:18] lord
[54:18] and so the holy spirit is hunting honest
[54:21] hearts
[54:23] that will believe that message
[54:27] everything in the bible that was
[54:30] promised
[54:31] is to that believer
[54:37] and so part of our cry to overcome
[54:41] is a cry of possession
[54:44] you are saying i want everything that
[54:47] god's got for me
[54:49] i want to overcome and do away with
[54:53] everything in my life that's keeping me
[54:57] from having everything that god
[55:00] promised us so they emphasize this again
[55:03] that is the spirit
[55:07] that the holy spirit is dealing with us
[55:10] that's how his holy spirit is working
[55:13] on us now to make us hunger
[55:16] and thirst after righteousness to make
[55:20] us want to possess the promises of god
[55:24] want us to have everything that god
[55:27] wants for us we want to have
[55:31] so if it's something that's burning
[55:33] within our
[55:34] hearts and our minds to uh
[55:38] to have this and we don't even realize
[55:42] it's like something that's down inside
[55:44] of us all of a sudden
[55:46] we become dissatisfied with things that
[55:49] are not
[55:49] of god and and and that battle
[55:53] is is is raging now
[55:56] uh for control satan doesn't want to
[55:59] give you up
[56:01] and uh and uh
[56:04] and yeah and so there there's a a
[56:07] a path that's provided in god's word
[56:11] for us to obtain the things that god has
[56:14] for us to obtain
[56:16] so if you're going to reach this
[56:18] pinnacle
[56:19] of this faith there's certain things
[56:22] that
[56:23] that are required of us to do
[56:26] certain attitudes certain actions and so
[56:29] as he goes on here he says
[56:36] to the believer and when you accept
[56:40] it in its fullness then god
[56:44] knows that you will do it
[56:50] he knows you're going to do it okay
[56:53] now it like he told paul
[56:56] it's hard to kick against the prick
[56:58] isn't it paul
[57:00] but i'm going to show you all the things
[57:02] you're going to suffer for my namesake
[57:05] so keep running paul keep doing what
[57:07] you're doing but i know what you're
[57:09] going to do
[57:10] you are going to bring my message to the
[57:12] gentiles
[57:13] and if i have to blind you and i have to
[57:16] put you on the backside of the desert
[57:19] i will blind you and put you on the
[57:21] backside of the desert
[57:22] but i have a predestinated will that i
[57:26] want to perform in you
[57:28] now we've taught that so we understand
[57:31] that
[57:31] so and he goes on to read he says then
[57:35] god knows that you'll do it he gives you
[57:39] the abstract to that then
[57:42] every promise that is made
[57:46] is in your possession and the holy
[57:50] spirit
[57:51] has to quicken
[57:54] that to you now
[57:58] that's kind of a funny statement
[58:02] he says not will or can
[58:06] he has to quicken that to you
[58:09] if he hunts you down and he seeks you
[58:12] out and because he wants he knows that
[58:16] you're his
[58:17] just like the eagle looking for the
[58:19] thing then he has to
[58:21] quicken that to you you understand he
[58:23] has to give you the revelation of it
[58:25] he has to give you the power to
[58:28] transform
[58:30] into uh what that he has
[58:34] in his heart and mind for you so
[58:38] the point that i'm trying to make here
[58:39] is that the
[58:41] cry within us to overcome
[58:44] is something that is being caused by the
[58:47] move of the holy spirit
[58:49] in the day that we're living in so okay
[58:52] we've got to come in contact with the
[58:55] hour
[58:56] recognize the hour and recognize what it
[59:00] is that god
[59:01] is trying to fulfill in our lives as
[59:04] individuals as a church as a
[59:08] representation
[59:09] of his gospel that that there's
[59:12] there's he's got like as our brothers
[59:15] have preached
[59:16] well we were on this great pattern of
[59:18] god that he's trying to fulfill
[59:21] and he said he has to quicken that to
[59:24] you oh my
[59:25] what kind of people should we be
[59:29] how wonderful to see
[59:34] god's great holy spirit here
[59:37] to do that uh
[59:40] power think of it to see that the holy
[59:43] spirit is here to do
[59:45] that power what power is he
[59:49] talking about that power to quicken
[59:52] that power to hunt that power to find
[59:55] you
[59:56] that power to bring it to pass in you
[59:59] just think he says how wonderful it is
[1:00:01] that the holy spirit here is here to
[1:00:04] perform that power
[1:00:07] amen the holy spirit is here to do
[1:00:11] that power i always believed that
[1:00:14] brother ben had
[1:00:15] ways of saying things that
[1:00:18] could not be misconstrued to the ear
[1:00:22] that has been here to hear he said the
[1:00:24] holy spirit
[1:00:25] is here to do that power think of it
[1:00:28] the holy spirit itself is here to bear
[1:00:31] record of this hour
[1:00:35] jesus said so he's the same yesterday
[1:00:38] today and forever how dare
[1:00:42] any man to wipe that out
[1:00:45] of there
[1:00:48] you can't take the fact out the holy
[1:00:50] spirit's here
[1:00:52] working calling hunting quickening
[1:00:56] revealing and doing what he's doing
[1:01:00] amen these signs shall follow them
[1:01:03] that believe that is the assurance
[1:01:07] and now listen when we see
[1:01:10] a group of people sitting together
[1:01:14] and those signs manifesting themselves
[1:01:18] that's the assurance that the abstract
[1:01:21] is there to vindicate that's
[1:01:24] the property of god amen
[1:01:27] so we are easter
[1:01:30] also amen
[1:01:36] we are easter also so
[1:01:39] what was easter was the resurrection we
[1:01:42] are in a resurrection also
[1:01:45] we are in a transformation we
[1:01:48] are in a changing we are in an exodus
[1:01:52] so we don't want to ever take this
[1:01:54] message and believe
[1:01:56] it's like something historical that god
[1:01:59] has done
[1:01:59] so what he's saying we are part of the
[1:02:02] hunt
[1:02:03] we are part of the manifestation we are
[1:02:06] part of what god's doing
[1:02:08] uh what what god's doing part of the
[1:02:10] quickening
[1:02:11] who that he's quickening so these great
[1:02:14] things
[1:02:14] are working within us you may be
[1:02:17] suffering you may have an illness you
[1:02:19] may have
[1:02:20] something in your body but yet that
[1:02:22] resurrecting life is still working
[1:02:24] towards that healing
[1:02:26] amen the the very quickening power of it
[1:02:30] and the bringing to pass of the power of
[1:02:33] it it has its day of manifestation
[1:02:36] so that's what we look to we look to the
[1:02:39] day of manifestation
[1:02:40] just like looking at a man that's ill
[1:02:44] if your body is ill he says put a vision
[1:02:46] of
[1:02:47] a healthy you and then walk towards that
[1:02:51] walk towards that that that's what
[1:02:53] that's what you believe you take the
[1:02:55] faith you have
[1:02:56] what you believe you place that vision
[1:02:59] towards you
[1:03:00] and that's what you confess you don't
[1:03:02] confess
[1:03:03] what you are you confess what you will
[1:03:05] be we don't confess
[1:03:07] what we are we confess what he's going
[1:03:10] to make
[1:03:10] us because our faith testifies
[1:03:14] of what that he said that we would be
[1:03:17] abraham testified of a baby he testified
[1:03:21] to that baby coming by
[1:03:23] sarah that's what he testified to
[1:03:26] although he couldn't see it
[1:03:28] yet he believed god for it
[1:03:31] and so then he knew that god had to
[1:03:34] quicken that
[1:03:36] and so the hunger that's in your heart
[1:03:39] the desire
[1:03:40] that you have to overcome the the cry
[1:03:44] that's in us i don't want to be backslid
[1:03:46] i don't want to have this habit
[1:03:48] i don't want to keep doing this i don't
[1:03:50] keep wanting to watch that stuff on the
[1:03:52] computer
[1:03:53] i don't want to feel this way toward my
[1:03:55] neighbor i i'm tired of the way i
[1:03:58] am i uh you know i i don't want to be
[1:04:01] embarrassed
[1:04:02] all these great things is the cry within
[1:04:06] you to overcome
[1:04:08] now it may not be a a a cry from your
[1:04:11] mouth
[1:04:12] that you're speaking it but you know
[1:04:15] when you
[1:04:16] find yourself in the hour of failure
[1:04:20] that there's something that's still in
[1:04:22] you christ
[1:04:23] i want to overcome this
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:27] i want to be free from this i want to do
[1:04:29] better
[1:04:32] and and you know and the flesh wars
[1:04:35] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:04:37] against the flesh
[1:04:38] and these two are contrary to another
[1:04:41] what i think that
[1:04:42] we've got to come to our realization and
[1:04:44] understanding
[1:04:46] that that very cry within you to
[1:04:49] overcome is the spirit of god working on
[1:04:53] you because he's going to perform that
[1:04:57] but he he in any time of fellowship
[1:05:00] he wants you to participate in
[1:05:04] what the transformation is
[1:05:09] he wants to quicken it to you or
[1:05:11] enlighten it to you paul prayed that
[1:05:14] that our understanding might be an
[1:05:16] increase that we might have an
[1:05:18] understanding of the hand of god
[1:05:21] and the way that god works
[1:05:24] you know most of the unbelievers that
[1:05:27] read this message
[1:05:28] that's what they're trying to find
[1:05:30] they're trying to find
[1:05:32] how did brother branham do this you know
[1:05:34] and they try to take his faith
[1:05:36] and the things that he used to faith to
[1:05:39] see if they can reproduce that faith
[1:05:42] but brother branham wasn't producing
[1:05:44] miracles he was producing a bride
[1:06:02] he says now we are easter also
[1:06:05] amen we are now in our
[1:06:09] easter so we are in
[1:06:12] the hour of our overcoming
[1:06:19] this is where we are i i don't
[1:06:22] i feel that he's standing at the door
[1:06:25] knocking
[1:06:26] and see him that overcometh look if to
[1:06:30] him that
[1:06:30] overcometh is going to sit on the throne
[1:06:34] then any true believers crying out i
[1:06:36] want to overcome
[1:06:38] because overcoming's the way to the
[1:06:40] throne
[1:06:44] so there's a great cried overcome he's
[1:06:47] already raised hallelujah
[1:06:49] from the things of the world to the
[1:06:51] things of god's promise
[1:06:54] right so let's go back and read that
[1:06:56] again we are now
[1:06:58] in our easter we have already raised
[1:07:02] hallelujah
[1:07:03] from the things of the world to the
[1:07:06] things
[1:07:06] of god's promise not we will we
[1:07:10] are it's the potential
[1:07:13] the potential it's god's promise
[1:07:17] he will pour out his spirit in the last
[1:07:20] day
[1:07:21] and that's what they would
[1:07:24] do you see it he said so
[1:07:27] we're crying because we have the promise
[1:07:31] that he'll pour out his spirit in this
[1:07:33] last day
[1:07:34] and that's what we will do
[1:07:39] we will overcome
[1:07:43] we will overcome the cry to overcome
[1:07:47] is is working within us
[1:07:52] now so we have that promise of
[1:07:55] what that we
[1:07:58] will do so this morning
[1:08:01] that's what that we're wanting to
[1:08:05] look at because we if we're not going
[1:08:08] forward we're
[1:08:10] backsliding
[1:08:14] and that that's what we want to come to
[1:08:17] a greater realization of
[1:08:19] to this morning is how do we go forward
[1:08:26] okay because to go forward is to
[1:08:29] overcome
[1:08:32] to go forward is to overcome
[1:08:35] you don't finish the job if you don't
[1:08:38] keep working at it
[1:08:43] and if you get distracted from a job
[1:08:46] you've got to return back to it
[1:08:50] and so we understand that being backslid
[1:08:55] means to to go back to to
[1:08:58] our old ways to go back
[1:09:01] to habits to go back to things
[1:09:04] that we felt that
[1:09:08] we overcame but
[1:09:11] there there's uh i think an
[1:09:15] understanding and and that's what
[1:09:18] i want to listen to these next 17
[1:09:21] minutes for
[1:09:23] is so we can build a little bit and
[1:09:25] receive
[1:09:26] from uh the word of god
[1:09:30] something that's very very
[1:09:34] important to the age and the hour
[1:09:38] we're in so this cry
[1:09:41] to overcome is going to cause us
[1:09:46] to come in contact
[1:09:50] and uh that's sort of what we'd like to
[1:09:54] lay out there today i i believe that
[1:09:57] this message
[1:09:59] is one that people from
[1:10:02] any faith or any belief can read it
[1:10:07] and understand it and glean things from
[1:10:10] it
[1:10:10] but i also believe that there are
[1:10:12] special things that's hid within it
[1:10:15] that are only for his children
[1:10:19] you know they're they're they're things
[1:10:21] that are for you
[1:10:23] and and uh so we're addressing this
[1:10:26] morning
[1:10:27] this desire in our heart this
[1:10:31] cry to overcome i don't think i'm the
[1:10:33] only person that has
[1:10:35] maybe i'm the only person in here that
[1:10:36] needs to overcome
[1:10:39] you know what i mean but i think it's
[1:10:43] i think it's almost on every heart of
[1:10:45] any brother that i come in contact with
[1:10:49] we look at ourselves and we say yuck
[1:10:52] that's right
[1:10:56] you know and that's what we'll see
[1:11:00] so let's listen and work and
[1:11:04] uh if you have your bibles uh
[1:11:08] uh and you'll turn over into
[1:11:11] the uh i'll give you the scripture here
[1:11:20] and i i believe it's in
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:24] the book of jonah and uh
[1:11:28] i don't i don't have the verse wrote
[1:11:29] down here but if you go to the book of
[1:11:31] jonah
[1:11:32] um then um
[1:11:37] we'll find the scripture reading that we
[1:11:40] have
[1:11:42] and it says now the word of the lord
[1:11:44] came to jonah
[1:11:45] and
[1:11:50] i got my i'm trying my new bible out
[1:11:54] here
[1:11:55] uh preaching from it
[1:11:58] and all right
[1:12:02] well it's in your bible somewhere
[1:12:07] anyway i can't find where's my book at
[1:12:09] joan at where's joan adams
[1:12:12] jerk i love answer like that
[1:12:15] just like obadiah where's
[1:12:19] obadiah all right i know it's in there
[1:12:22] all right let's stand if you found the
[1:12:24] book of jonah
[1:12:25] that and uh so we'll we'll start
[1:12:28] listening to the tape
[1:12:29] and when and uh when uh
[1:12:33] brother brahms done reading the the
[1:12:35] scripture
[1:12:39] and he says isn't that a sad ending
[1:12:42] we'll go ahead and take our seat so
[1:12:46] brother says for 17 minutes let's listen
[1:12:49] to
[1:12:50] what our messenger said and then let's
[1:12:52] take a little lesson
[1:12:54] from it this morning amen remember the
[1:12:56] holy spirit
[1:12:58] is the one that's dealing with your
[1:13:00] heart and
[1:13:01] calling you and and
[1:13:04] hunting you down because it's given to
[1:13:07] the overcomer
[1:13:09] amen the cry to overcome god bless you
[1:13:14] uh many of you in your bibles i want you
[1:13:17] to turn to the book of jonah
[1:13:19] it's uh we always talk so much about
[1:13:22] jonah being
[1:13:23] a backslidden and everything i've always
[1:13:24] talked up for john
[1:13:26] i do not believe that jonah was
[1:13:28] backslidden
[1:13:30] uh do not believe that i believe it's
[1:13:33] just
[1:13:33] we just sometimes use it say he's a
[1:13:36] jonah
[1:13:37] but if we i've already spoke on it in
[1:13:40] another way and telling how that i
[1:13:41] thought
[1:13:42] jonah what talked place
[1:13:46] now the word of the lord came to
[1:13:49] jonah the son of amira
[1:13:52] saying arise and go to nineveh that
[1:13:55] great city
[1:13:56] cry out against it for their wickedness
[1:14:00] has come up before me but jonah rose up
[1:14:03] to flee
[1:14:04] unto tarshish from the presence of the
[1:14:07] lord
[1:14:08] and went down to joppa and he found a
[1:14:10] ship going to tarshish so
[1:14:12] he paid the fare thereof and went down
[1:14:16] into it to go with them unto tarshish
[1:14:20] from the presence of the lord
[1:14:24] isn't that a sad ending a man
[1:14:28] running from the presence of the lord
[1:14:31] and that's my subject now first
[1:14:34] we want to think of this jonah was
[1:14:38] the reason the principal reason that i
[1:14:41] believe that he
[1:14:42] did this great thing here was because
[1:14:45] jonah
[1:14:45] was a jew and he was asked to go to a
[1:14:49] gentile
[1:14:50] city to cry out against it thinking that
[1:14:53] he would not be received
[1:14:55] because the gentiles would think what's
[1:14:57] this jew got to do with us
[1:15:00] but you see another thing it gives us a
[1:15:02] great thing here to
[1:15:03] see that god not only is god of the jew
[1:15:07] but he's god
[1:15:08] also of the he's god of all people
[1:15:11] he just chose the jews
[1:15:15] the jews was called god's chosen people
[1:15:19] they were chosen for a pacific
[1:15:22] cause and that cause was to give to them
[1:15:25] the law
[1:15:27] and they could not keep it and he just
[1:15:29] showed by that people that the law
[1:15:32] could not be kept and if he was a
[1:15:35] uh a god of righteousness and the law
[1:15:38] demanded righteousness but there was no
[1:15:41] grace
[1:15:41] in law to bring a man out no penalty
[1:15:44] was paid by the law but it taken grace
[1:15:48] to pay that penalty or the war the law
[1:15:50] put us under and jonah here was
[1:15:53] called on as this one of the minor
[1:15:56] prophets of the bible
[1:15:58] to go down to this city and here we find
[1:16:02] an example of all of us every one of us
[1:16:05] we always are running from something
[1:16:08] we run from trouble we run from
[1:16:11] responsibilities
[1:16:13] we we're all prone to do that we
[1:16:16] we we're more prone to run and we are to
[1:16:19] stand and face it out
[1:16:20] see we just we we find ourselves running
[1:16:23] sometimes we find ourselves
[1:16:25] prone to run from work we don't want to
[1:16:27] we don't want to work
[1:16:29] some people just think they can make
[1:16:30] their living without working
[1:16:32] but i think solomon it was and said we
[1:16:34] could find
[1:16:35] uh here the answer i'm watching an ant
[1:16:38] you know a little ant
[1:16:39] they tell me if that every ant doesn't
[1:16:41] work and lay in
[1:16:43] that aunt doesn't eat that winter either
[1:16:45] so everybody
[1:16:46] has to to work we got so many things we
[1:16:49] have to do so much responsibility
[1:16:52] that we have to face everybody's got to
[1:16:55] face a certain responsibility
[1:16:57] when you when you come to choose your
[1:17:01] wife to
[1:17:02] get married or choose your husband you
[1:17:05] you've got
[1:17:05] to take a responsibility and then you
[1:17:09] must remember
[1:17:09] maybe you build a home it's a nice
[1:17:11] pretty home
[1:17:12] and then remember as a married woman
[1:17:15] you've got
[1:17:16] to think of the responsibility of
[1:17:18] raising children
[1:17:20] you got to think of that pretty slick
[1:17:22] walls are going to have little dirty
[1:17:24] handprints all over them
[1:17:26] then you got the responsibility of
[1:17:27] educating your children you got the
[1:17:29] responsibility of clothing and feeding
[1:17:30] everything is a responsibility and so
[1:17:34] easy when responsibilities faces to
[1:17:36] shirk from them
[1:17:38] and we find out that marriage is a
[1:17:41] responsibility in all matters
[1:17:43] even many times we find this is hard to
[1:17:46] say but it's true
[1:17:47] that ministers many times shirt
[1:17:51] a responsibility or standing
[1:17:54] for the true word of god when they're
[1:17:56] confronted with it
[1:17:58] they'll shirk that responsibility
[1:18:02] when truth of the word of god is brought
[1:18:04] face to face
[1:18:06] with we human beings we have we're prone
[1:18:09] to shirt back until the last
[1:18:12] resource i just got through talking to
[1:18:15] my little nephew up there
[1:18:16] he's a catholic and he uh now baptized
[1:18:20] that boy in the name of jesus christ
[1:18:22] here a few years ago
[1:18:23] and he got with some little girl and
[1:18:24] turned catholic and i held his mother's
[1:18:26] hand while she was dying over there
[1:18:28] she said to me the last words take care
[1:18:30] of melvin and he's just been dreaming
[1:18:32] dreams he just can't
[1:18:33] every every day the last week he's been
[1:18:35] dreaming dreams said i walk into your
[1:18:37] church uncle bill
[1:18:38] you're standing there preaching out run
[1:18:39] up to start to make your confession i'd
[1:18:41] wake up
[1:18:42] he said i i've been wrong i said melvin
[1:18:44] you don't need no interpretation for
[1:18:46] that
[1:18:47] your place is down there where you
[1:18:49] belong that's right
[1:18:50] i think but the face up to
[1:18:53] responsibilities
[1:18:55] sometimes it takes to very hide off of
[1:18:57] us to do that
[1:18:58] as a father to face up the
[1:19:00] responsibility to give you a child a
[1:19:02] weapon
[1:19:03] them little fellas you don't want to do
[1:19:04] that but as a father a mother
[1:19:06] you've got to face a responsibility of
[1:19:08] raising that child because the bible
[1:19:10] said
[1:19:11] spare the rod you spoil your son and
[1:19:13] that still stands good in the sight of
[1:19:16] every
[1:19:16] psychologist there is in a world that
[1:19:18] still remains god's truth
[1:19:20] if there'd been more of that practice
[1:19:22] and we wouldn't have had so much
[1:19:23] juvenile delinquency and stuff in the
[1:19:25] rot
[1:19:25] we got in the world today but the old
[1:19:28] golden rule of the homes been broken a
[1:19:30] long time ago and
[1:19:30] let the kids do whatever they want to
[1:19:32] but even as i said
[1:19:34] ministers they'll come face to face with
[1:19:37] truth and then
[1:19:38] walk away from it see they're they're
[1:19:40] just ha
[1:19:41] this seems like there's something that
[1:19:43] they they don't want to face up to it
[1:19:45] many times i've had people come say i
[1:19:47] know that's right brother branham
[1:19:49] but if i did that they kicked me out of
[1:19:51] the church whatever
[1:19:53] if you don't you're going to kick you
[1:19:55] out up there so you got to be kicked out
[1:19:57] somewhere
[1:19:58] see so you might as well face up to it
[1:20:01] instead of running from it say well i'll
[1:20:03] go over here i won't go back
[1:20:04] go back sure listen to some more of it
[1:20:07] search the scriptures
[1:20:08] jesus said search the scriptures for in
[1:20:10] them you think you have eternal life
[1:20:12] and they are they that testify of me but
[1:20:15] we find
[1:20:16] that people won't face up with that
[1:20:18] being brought to
[1:20:19] uh into the presence of god and see
[1:20:23] when god made a promise and god has
[1:20:25] obligated that promise and when he
[1:20:28] brings that promise to pass then people
[1:20:31] are afraid to
[1:20:32] face up to the responsibility of coping
[1:20:35] with the message of the hour we find
[1:20:38] that everywhere
[1:20:39] how about you lutherans how many
[1:20:41] lutherans was afraid
[1:20:43] uh people was afraid to face up to
[1:20:45] luther's truth when he come forth with
[1:20:47] justification
[1:20:48] look what it cost you maybe your own
[1:20:51] life to come out and confess jesus
[1:20:53] christ and
[1:20:54] and become a a lutheran look at you
[1:20:56] methodist
[1:20:57] how it used to be you all were called
[1:20:59] holy rollers i guess you know that
[1:21:01] and they get another spirit and jerk
[1:21:02] back and forth and they said they had
[1:21:04] the jerks
[1:21:05] the myth that no that ain't pentecostal
[1:21:07] that was methodist
[1:21:08] long years ago and they jerked and shook
[1:21:11] and fell under the power of god and it
[1:21:13] throwed water in their faces and fanned
[1:21:15] him with fans
[1:21:16] thought they passed out and now you were
[1:21:18] considered
[1:21:19] a bunch of holy rollers but you had your
[1:21:22] mothers and fathers had to either accept
[1:21:24] it face up to the truth and facts or
[1:21:26] turn
[1:21:27] her down what about you pentecostals
[1:21:29] that receive the restoration of the
[1:21:31] gifts
[1:21:31] when the baptism the holy ghost come out
[1:21:33] with speaking in tongues and the
[1:21:35] gifts of the spirit coming back in the
[1:21:37] church well the methodists wanted to
[1:21:39] kick you out and they did do it
[1:21:41] but you had to face up to it it's
[1:21:43] something you had to do
[1:21:45] what about the issue when it come out
[1:21:46] about the baptism in the name of jesus
[1:21:48] christ
[1:21:49] and you saw it was the truth you have to
[1:21:51] face up to it or do something about it
[1:21:54] you've got a responsibility everybody
[1:21:57] has
[1:21:57] and you must face up to these things all
[1:22:00] right
[1:22:01] and when you see that in this day now
[1:22:03] when the word of god has made these
[1:22:05] promises of things that we
[1:22:06] see happening now then we've got the
[1:22:08] responsibility to either
[1:22:10] face up to it or get away from it you
[1:22:13] have you just can't stay
[1:22:14] neutral you've got to do something about
[1:22:17] it
[1:22:18] since some moves got to be made you
[1:22:20] can't come in that church
[1:22:21] door and go out the same person you come
[1:22:23] in you're either further away or closer
[1:22:26] to god every time
[1:22:27] you come in or go out there oh
[1:22:30] how easy it is for people to shirt these
[1:22:33] things
[1:22:34] now i want us to think of these when we
[1:22:36] start into the official
[1:22:38] uh services tomorrow night that i want
[1:22:41] you to notice
[1:22:42] when something is confronted if you if
[1:22:44] there's a question about it
[1:22:46] if there's a question about it there's
[1:22:47] got to be an answer
[1:22:49] say for instance i said i was going west
[1:22:51] and you pointed me
[1:22:53] this way well the first thing you know i
[1:22:55] run plumber past my target
[1:22:56] and i'm too i'm northwest well while
[1:22:58] somebody points me down this way to go
[1:23:00] that way
[1:23:01] i'll pass my target again i went
[1:23:03] southwest well as long as there's a
[1:23:05] question which way
[1:23:06] is west there's got to be a direct
[1:23:07] answer somewhere and when these
[1:23:09] questions confront us about the bible
[1:23:11] truths
[1:23:12] there's got to be the right answer
[1:23:14] somewhere
[1:23:16] right there's got to be there and when
[1:23:18] we see something presented
[1:23:20] i think instead of just run away it's
[1:23:21] all nonsense i couldn't believe a thing
[1:23:23] like that
[1:23:24] i couldn't believe that why don't you
[1:23:26] take the bible and sit down and face up
[1:23:28] to it
[1:23:29] study it you're here in the meeting now
[1:23:31] just look it over
[1:23:33] check it out yourself with the word
[1:23:35] check the word by the word
[1:23:36] that's the only way to make it tell the
[1:23:38] truth and it must tell the truth
[1:23:39] from genesis or revelation
[1:23:43] christ is a revelation of the whole
[1:23:45] bible in him christ all the full and
[1:23:48] fulfilling of all the prophecies of the
[1:23:50] bible is met
[1:23:51] unconditionally in christ jesus because
[1:23:54] he
[1:23:54] was god manifested in the flesh now when
[1:23:57] we find these things old when we're
[1:23:59] confronted and come into a meeting and
[1:24:02] see the power of god
[1:24:04] moving and doing things and doing
[1:24:05] supernatural works and sit
[1:24:07] uh perform and look in the bible and see
[1:24:09] that it's promised for this hour
[1:24:12] then when we see those things then we
[1:24:14] are confronted with the responsibility
[1:24:16] to either accept it
[1:24:18] i mean as for ourselves now many people
[1:24:21] sympathize
[1:24:22] many people say it's right but that
[1:24:25] don't
[1:24:25] that don't make it what that ain't the
[1:24:27] thing that you're responsible for
[1:24:30] is i've said what if i was a young man
[1:24:32] and looking for a wife to be married
[1:24:34] and you're stood a girl that met every
[1:24:36] qualification that i thought it took to
[1:24:38] make a woman
[1:24:39] why morally she was a queen and lovely
[1:24:42] and
[1:24:42] a fine personality a real christian
[1:24:45] everything that i could think of to make
[1:24:47] me a good wife
[1:24:48] no matter how much i say she's perfect
[1:24:50] she's exactly right
[1:24:52] she isn't mine until i accept her and
[1:24:55] the responsibility
[1:24:57] of her being my wife that's the same
[1:24:59] thing the message is you might say it's
[1:25:01] right
[1:25:02] or this that word say i sympathize with
[1:25:04] it i believe it's the truth
[1:25:05] but you've got to accept it and it's got
[1:25:07] to become a part of you and you're a
[1:25:09] part of it
[1:25:10] you've got then it's yours
[1:25:13] when you marry this certain woman that
[1:25:15] you have chosen you are
[1:25:17] you are one man and that's where you are
[1:25:19] with christ
[1:25:20] when you see him manifested and made
[1:25:23] real then you are
[1:25:24] part of him and he's part of you and
[1:25:27] together you're part of
[1:25:28] the message oh how many denominational
[1:25:32] ships have we got going down to tarshish
[1:25:34] for the jonahs of these days
[1:25:37] 900 of them something a ships that takes
[1:25:40] the easy route
[1:25:42] don't want to face up to jonah didn't
[1:25:44] want to face up the thing of going to
[1:25:46] the gentiles
[1:25:47] he didn't want to take that cruel
[1:25:48] message over there within 40 days
[1:25:51] you'll perish if you don't repent he
[1:25:54] hated to do that he thought that
[1:25:55] gentiles was hard to tell what they'll
[1:25:57] do to me
[1:25:58] but he had to face up to it he but he
[1:26:01] took a
[1:26:01] easy ship and went down the tarshit went
[1:26:04] down in the
[1:26:05] hole the ship and went to sleep
[1:26:08] took the easy route the easy way it's a
[1:26:11] popular way with the people
[1:26:13] it's easy to take the way where
[1:26:15] everybody can patch you on the back and
[1:26:16] say you're a good fella
[1:26:18] and this is so and so uncertain in the
[1:26:20] world look upon you it's easy to go the
[1:26:22] proper way
[1:26:24] but when when you have to do something
[1:26:27] different
[1:26:28] when you have to stand to your
[1:26:30] conviction and what you
[1:26:31] know to be the truth there's where the
[1:26:33] hard part
[1:26:34] that's the rub comes right there oh as
[1:26:37] we've often sang that old song
[1:26:39] how easy while sailing the sea and it's
[1:26:41] calm to trust in the strength of
[1:26:42] jehovah's great arm
[1:26:44] but oh let the waves begin to blow
[1:26:47] let the wind blow and whip up the waves
[1:26:50] then what do you do
[1:26:51] something like i was told one time the
[1:26:53] lady said back in the horse and buggy
[1:26:55] days that
[1:26:56] said the horse ran away with her going
[1:26:57] from church said what'd you do said i
[1:26:59] trusted the lord until the lines broke
[1:27:02] well that's the time to trust the lord
[1:27:04] after ever
[1:27:05] after the lines is broke you're trusting
[1:27:07] in the lines until they're broke
[1:27:10] yes and um so we find out that we have
[1:27:13] many easy ways to go ships going down
[1:27:17] the tarsher parts easy the
[1:27:20] unresponsibilities
[1:27:21] it just flows in you have everything
[1:27:23] coming everybody's
[1:27:24] likes you and everybody your nobody
[1:27:27] disagree with you you disagree with
[1:27:28] nobody
[1:27:29] now if that ain't a dishrag
[1:27:33] that's right yes push over flop over
[1:27:37] why anybody i don't care who you are
[1:27:41] and what you're standing for actually
[1:27:43] decent thinking people think more of you
[1:27:45] if you'll stand for your conviction of
[1:27:47] what's right
[1:27:48] right don't care you take a woman she
[1:27:50] might
[1:27:51] be ever not very attractive in whatever
[1:27:54] she is but you let that woman
[1:27:55] stand for principles of womanhood let
[1:27:58] her
[1:27:58] stand like a lady and if a man's got an
[1:28:01] ounce a man about him he'll take up for
[1:28:03] absolutely we appreciate something that
[1:28:05] that somebody's got that they believe
[1:28:07] that is the truth and will stand for
[1:28:09] what they think is right
[1:28:11] how wishy washy that's what too many
[1:28:14] christians that they are so
[1:28:15] soft-soaked and everything until they
[1:28:17] think all they do is join a church go in
[1:28:19] somewhere put their name on a book
[1:28:21] or do a little something jump up and
[1:28:22] down shouter or something like that and
[1:28:24] call it christianity
[1:28:26] christianity is a everyday rugged life
[1:28:28] living for god
[1:28:30] in this presence world it's a
[1:28:33] constant burning of the fire and love of
[1:28:35] god in the heart that sets you apart and
[1:28:37] puts you out younger with the people and
[1:28:39] making converts to christ
[1:28:42] responsibilities but it's easy to go the
[1:28:44] way the world goes it's easy to flow
[1:28:46] down the stream
[1:28:47] go out there and sit down in the river
[1:28:48] with your boat you get your oars and
[1:28:50] start pulling up against the current
[1:28:52] you don't make much time and it goes
[1:28:54] hard but you just once let loose the
[1:28:56] oars and watch how fast you pass the
[1:28:58] trees going down
[1:28:59] but look where you're going when things
[1:29:02] are floating easy remember you're going
[1:29:04] towards a
[1:29:05] a great cataract down there of some sort
[1:29:07] you're going towards the falls
[1:29:09] it won't be long you'll be going over
[1:29:11] that falls just floating
[1:29:12] with the world easy the way it goes you
[1:29:15] don't want that
[1:29:16] no sir but you must accept your
[1:29:19] responsibility
[1:29:20] now you believe it and you you think
[1:29:22] it's the truth
[1:29:24] and the responsibility that god has
[1:29:25] given us in this day
[1:29:27] to bring this message and as i get older
[1:29:31] and i know my days are sharpening up i
[1:29:33] feel a responsibility greater than i
[1:29:35] ever felt
[1:29:37] press it on
[1:29:40] we must do it we must get down to it you
[1:29:43] know
[1:29:44] everywhere we go and tell the message
[1:29:47] and tell the people that jesus christ is
[1:29:49] coming that he's god and he's coming
[1:29:52] soon there's not a not a hope left in
[1:29:54] the world but the coming of the lord
[1:29:58] amen
[1:30:01] now if you've got one ounce of
[1:30:02] spirituality you know where i'm going
[1:30:05] amen
[1:30:11] you know when
[1:30:15] he the point he's making here and i
[1:30:19] think that this is
[1:30:21] uh this is in the same line of the
[1:30:24] services
[1:30:25] that we've been preaching
[1:30:29] we've we've we talked about uh
[1:30:33] in the line of the service's birth pains
[1:30:36] and
[1:30:36] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:30:39] then the
[1:30:40] sermon that brother brandon preached
[1:30:42] after that was a door
[1:30:43] in a door and he talked in the door and
[1:30:46] the door about he stands at the door and
[1:30:49] knocked
[1:30:50] and so that we took what was said
[1:30:54] in that message door and a door and
[1:30:56] begin to add it
[1:30:57] to this running from the presence of the
[1:31:01] lord
[1:31:01] and you know we look at so many times
[1:31:04] the presence of the lord
[1:31:06] we just look at it as being
[1:31:09] the feeling or an anointing
[1:31:13] that we come into but we know one thing
[1:31:17] about that anointing is when
[1:31:19] you come under that anointing it'll
[1:31:21] convict you of unbelief
[1:31:24] it's in the light of god's word that
[1:31:26] everything comes to your mind
[1:31:30] of all that you've done and and your
[1:31:33] weaknesses and your failures and
[1:31:36] and we're not emphasizing this morning
[1:31:39] those weaknesses
[1:31:40] and their failures because we all have
[1:31:44] them we we all have our
[1:31:47] list of the things that uh and of the
[1:31:50] things that we so
[1:31:51] easily uh fall to but our our
[1:31:54] our desire today is to come to
[1:31:58] if i could say this a greater
[1:32:00] understanding
[1:32:01] of of of this
[1:32:05] cry that's in us to overcome
[1:32:09] and what what that cry is going
[1:32:13] to lead us to because
[1:32:17] brother brown is laying this point here
[1:32:19] and his point
[1:32:21] is is that jonah
[1:32:24] was backslid
[1:32:27] or in other words he was running from
[1:32:30] the responsibility
[1:32:33] that was placed for him
[1:32:37] to do that that's what
[1:32:42] that's what uh he did the reasons that
[1:32:45] he did
[1:32:46] it were explained he was a jew
[1:32:50] and so he looked at himself well i'm a
[1:32:52] jew
[1:32:53] and therefore i can't go to these
[1:32:56] gentiles
[1:32:57] and that became his excuse
[1:33:00] and and that's what we're full of
[1:33:04] we're full of excuses i can't do it well
[1:33:07] the prophet of god preached a message
[1:33:09] called perfect strength
[1:33:10] in perfect weakness and the point of
[1:33:13] that message is
[1:33:14] is you can't come up with excuses
[1:33:17] that cause you to reshirt from your
[1:33:21] responsibility
[1:33:22] and face up amen
[1:33:26] and that's what that in our lives i
[1:33:29] think that's what
[1:33:30] we've come down to is we've come down to
[1:33:33] the time
[1:33:34] that we've got to face
[1:33:37] up to it no matter what it is
[1:33:41] in your life i'm not going to hunt for
[1:33:43] things that you have to face up
[1:33:45] it's the understanding that you've got
[1:33:49] to come
[1:33:49] face to face with every issue
[1:33:53] every decision every responsibility
[1:33:57] in your life you've got to come down to
[1:34:00] the time in your life
[1:34:01] that you stop and you come face to face
[1:34:05] with it
[1:34:05] and you look at it for what it really is
[1:34:08] you look at what you're dealing with
[1:34:11] you're honest about it your description
[1:34:14] of it
[1:34:15] is honest you're not making any excuses
[1:34:18] this is how i am this is where i'm at
[1:34:22] this is what i do this is my weakness
[1:34:25] now i've come face to face with it
[1:34:32] always uh you know because of my
[1:34:34] position as being a pastor and people
[1:34:36] come
[1:34:37] sit down and and and talk
[1:34:40] and the minute that they start making
[1:34:43] excuses
[1:34:45] and saying why they did this and why
[1:34:47] they did that
[1:34:48] and somebody else there's no way to help
[1:34:51] them
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:54] yeah after talking to you it sounds like
[1:34:57] i need to be talking to the other person
[1:35:05] what it's the failure and now remember
[1:35:09] he didn't just throw this he said jonah
[1:35:12] is an
[1:35:12] example of us all right we all
[1:35:16] do this
[1:35:21] he said it's in us to do it
[1:35:25] so now we've got this cry in our hearts
[1:35:29] to overcome
[1:35:31] because the holy spirit is calling us
[1:35:35] he's dealing with us he's hunting us
[1:35:38] down
[1:35:39] he's sowing his word uh upon us
[1:35:44] and him starting to deal with us it it
[1:35:48] creates the cry in
[1:35:49] us so we have this cryingness i want to
[1:35:52] overcome
[1:35:53] i want to do better i want to overcome
[1:35:57] this i want to get this
[1:35:58] out of my life you know there should be
[1:36:00] a cry in us
[1:36:02] that i want to do something for god
[1:36:05] that's right i just don't want to live
[1:36:09] every day i don't want to have an easy
[1:36:13] path i want something more in my life
[1:36:19] i want to be on fire for god it it's a
[1:36:23] hunger
[1:36:24] and a thirst in us but
[1:36:28] you can't jump any of the steps
[1:36:33] he said at birth he said has a process
[1:36:36] the birth pains is the process that
[1:36:39] you've got to go through
[1:36:40] so there's a process to overcome
[1:36:44] there's a process to get the victory
[1:36:49] and that's what the majority that we
[1:36:52] find
[1:36:53] and i find i'm preaching this to myself
[1:36:55] that i find in myself
[1:36:57] i always create
[1:37:00] a way around it
[1:37:06] you water it down
[1:37:10] you whitewash it those are terms that
[1:37:13] brother random use that's what they used
[1:37:14] to do to
[1:37:15] fences it was like you didn't really
[1:37:18] paint it exactly
[1:37:19] you just took kind of a diluted paint
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:22] you just kind of put it on there and
[1:37:24] covered up the little
[1:37:25] uh the marks and the little prints and
[1:37:28] stuff
[1:37:28] so it didn't look as bad you just cover
[1:37:31] it up
[1:37:33] now you have to understand we're not
[1:37:35] talking about my relationship with billy
[1:37:38] we're not talking about
[1:37:39] my relationship with any of the other
[1:37:41] brothers or people
[1:37:42] we're not talking about relationships
[1:37:44] we're talking about
[1:37:45] what's transpiring within ourselves
[1:37:49] and within our mind so within our very
[1:37:53] selves
[1:37:53] the things that we want to overcome the
[1:37:56] things that we want to make better
[1:37:58] the things that we all we want out of
[1:38:00] our life those are the very things that
[1:38:03] we're running away from
[1:38:04] those are the very things that we're
[1:38:06] whitewashing those are the very things
[1:38:08] we don't deal with
[1:38:10] but in order to overcome it you've got
[1:38:12] to come
[1:38:13] face to face with it
[1:38:19] you've got to give a true pure
[1:38:22] analysis of yourself
[1:38:30] so what is well i'm just weak
[1:38:36] i've got lust i've got pride
[1:38:40] i've got envy i've got jealousy
[1:38:44] i've got hatred
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:49] you kind of call it what it is
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:38:54] you're not hiding anything from him
[1:39:00] like adam and eve sold fig leagues so
[1:39:03] they could hide their sin
[1:39:08] that's why he died did you hear what the
[1:39:10] prophet of god said in the beginning of
[1:39:12] this
[1:39:13] he said he separated the jews
[1:39:16] for a cause
[1:39:19] the cause was to give them a law they
[1:39:22] couldn't live by
[1:39:23] so everybody could see you can't live by
[1:39:26] the law
[1:39:30] takes the blood of the lamb there's only
[1:39:33] one provided place of worship
[1:39:38] so you've got to you've got to come
[1:39:40] you've got to face up
[1:39:42] you've got to come face to face with it
[1:39:45] so you've got the holy spirit
[1:39:48] putting a cry in your heart to overcome
[1:39:52] and to it so it's not what you overcome
[1:39:55] it's how you overcome it and the first
[1:39:58] thing you've got to do is he's saying
[1:39:59] you've got to come
[1:40:01] face to face with it
[1:40:05] now the reason jonah was backslid
[1:40:10] because he was running from his
[1:40:12] responsibility
[1:40:19] and we just heard as plain as day
[1:40:22] there's responsibilities with
[1:40:26] everything everything
[1:40:29] has responsibilities everything
[1:40:32] that you do in your life there are
[1:40:35] things
[1:40:36] that you are responsible
[1:40:39] for there's responsibilities
[1:40:44] that go along with christianity
[1:40:50] there are certain things as being a
[1:40:52] christian
[1:40:53] you are responsible for
[1:40:58] but what do we do what did he say
[1:41:02] we're backslid or we're not where we
[1:41:05] want to be
[1:41:06] because we're not facing the
[1:41:08] responsibilities
[1:41:09] we've whitewashed them
[1:41:13] we've we've come up with excuses we've
[1:41:16] come up with reasons i don't want to
[1:41:18] offend anybody
[1:41:22] now i i just went through an experience
[1:41:24] and i i'm so thankful
[1:41:26] that i went through that experience i go
[1:41:29] to my barber shop i started going there
[1:41:32] and because my good barber friend moved
[1:41:35] to
[1:41:36] phoenix and uh he probably watches he
[1:41:39] watches some of our services and he
[1:41:41] knows he probably looks at my barber and
[1:41:43] thinks
[1:41:44] boy that guy's not doing a very good job
[1:41:47] that's all right but i'm in the barber
[1:41:48] shop
[1:41:50] and they're a pretty old rough bunch of
[1:41:52] guys you know and
[1:41:54] and uh so they're all there talking
[1:41:56] about a lady that
[1:41:58] came into the shop and and
[1:42:01] and i don't know the mental condition of
[1:42:03] the lady you know
[1:42:04] i i don't know what she was doing but
[1:42:07] she
[1:42:08] went in there to testify to him and ask
[1:42:10] him if they were saved and they were all
[1:42:15] just mocking her and she went to the
[1:42:17] next door and they
[1:42:19] the barber said i went outside and the
[1:42:21] guy said that crazy lady coming here too
[1:42:23] yeah
[1:42:24] and they were all telling how they said
[1:42:25] well we kicked her out of the store and
[1:42:28] told her to do this and everything and i
[1:42:30] sat there and i thought
[1:42:33] i'll just sit here and all of a sudden
[1:42:35] something welded me i just
[1:42:37] looked out there and i said well at
[1:42:40] least she was telling the truth
[1:42:43] she told them they're all going to meet
[1:42:44] jesus someday and he's coming
[1:42:47] and if they don't get right with him
[1:42:49] they're going to hell
[1:42:53] well they threw the lady out of the shop
[1:42:57] but i'll guarantee there was one person
[1:42:59] in there that wanted to tangle with me
[1:43:05] and i said at least she's telling you
[1:43:07] the truth
[1:43:10] man i thought the clippers went off in
[1:43:12] that place it got
[1:43:13] it got so quiet
[1:43:17] you never looked so fast that people
[1:43:19] want to change the subject
[1:43:24] i'm you know i didn't get up and leave i
[1:43:27] didn't keep going i said she may not
[1:43:29] have been right
[1:43:29] in the house she said said it but what
[1:43:32] she said
[1:43:34] is true and i'll believe it
[1:43:39] but i i i in my heart
[1:43:43] it it wasn't a moment of of like
[1:43:46] glory and revelation it all of a sudden
[1:43:50] it
[1:43:50] came onto me like a ton of bricks i'm
[1:43:53] responsible
[1:43:57] for this i have a responsibility
[1:44:02] that goes along with
[1:44:05] what that i'm claiming
[1:44:10] and i thought well why can't i've got
[1:44:12] this great call
[1:44:13] to overcome i've got this great desire
[1:44:16] to grow higher
[1:44:18] and to get victories and to have power
[1:44:22] and to have all these things but power
[1:44:24] without character
[1:44:25] is satanic and real
[1:44:29] character is based on a person that
[1:44:32] lives up and takes responsibility for
[1:44:36] their actions
[1:44:37] takes responsibility of their calling
[1:44:40] takes responsibility of the job that
[1:44:42] they're due
[1:44:43] and they're willing to stand up there
[1:44:45] and be responsible
[1:44:48] for their testimonies
[1:44:55] and and i feel that that
[1:44:58] there all these things these
[1:44:59] shortcomings
[1:45:01] in our life you can't overcome them
[1:45:06] until you face up to them
[1:45:11] if you've got to look at the real
[1:45:13] reality that you're in religions of
[1:45:16] covering
[1:45:17] that's right we take grace
[1:45:21] and we cover up our shortcomings we take
[1:45:24] calvary
[1:45:26] and we cover up our shortcomings we used
[1:45:28] all these excuses we shrink from the
[1:45:31] responsibility
[1:45:32] we we we push them into corners and
[1:45:35] that's what brother branham was
[1:45:36] preaching in door to a door
[1:45:38] he says he stands at the door and knocks
[1:45:41] and we open the door and we let them in
[1:45:45] but there's all these other doors
[1:45:49] there are doors within door
[1:45:53] the doors within the door we open the
[1:45:57] door so if i could say this there's
[1:45:59] responsibilities
[1:46:01] within christianity
[1:46:07] it can answer that this
[1:46:10] cry to overcome is really a
[1:46:14] cry to responsibility
[1:46:20] that's what jonah was running from he
[1:46:22] was running from his responsibility
[1:46:25] to bring the message that god
[1:46:28] had given him to bring
[1:46:34] the responsibility of it
[1:46:38] and that you know i just thought
[1:46:41] even in my own life i need to sit down
[1:46:43] and just ask myself what are my
[1:46:44] responsibilities
[1:46:46] what are the things i'm supposed to be
[1:46:48] doing
[1:46:50] what are the things that that god is
[1:46:53] expecting
[1:46:54] me to do and and and
[1:46:57] and i'm not going to go through a list
[1:46:59] of responsibilities because it's those
[1:47:01] i'm not trying to pin it down to
[1:47:04] specifics
[1:47:05] i want you to understand in my heart i
[1:47:08] want to understand
[1:47:10] a part of us going forward
[1:47:13] as a church apart for us going forward
[1:47:17] as an individual apart for us to
[1:47:20] overcome and climb that rung into the
[1:47:23] next ladder
[1:47:24] is we've got to understand we've got to
[1:47:27] find
[1:47:28] and be responsible for the things
[1:47:31] that are that come with what we are
[1:47:37] as long as we're lucy goosey
[1:47:41] and are taking the easy stream
[1:47:44] and shirking our responsibilities we'll
[1:47:48] never see that supernatural
[1:47:51] come to pass in our desire because
[1:47:54] it doesn't have any place to rest
[1:47:59] that faith has got to have something
[1:48:01] that's built on
[1:48:02] something solid so it's just that we've
[1:48:05] got to meet the responsibilities
[1:48:08] of what you uh
[1:48:11] what you're called to be
[1:48:16] what are what's the responsibilities of
[1:48:19] the bride of christ
[1:48:24] i'm called to be the bride i'm called to
[1:48:26] be a an ambassador
[1:48:29] what's the um what's the what's the
[1:48:32] duties and the responsibilities
[1:48:34] of an ambassador we send an ambassador
[1:48:37] to a certain
[1:48:38] country what's what's his
[1:48:40] responsibilities
[1:48:42] what's that ambassador's
[1:48:44] responsibilities
[1:48:45] to sit in a nice house to go have
[1:48:49] tea no he's there to represent the
[1:48:54] business
[1:48:54] interest he's there to tell the
[1:48:57] government we have a company that
[1:48:59] supplies that
[1:49:00] we have businesses we have investors
[1:49:03] that would like to invest
[1:49:04] make an investment deal there's all
[1:49:06] these things
[1:49:07] responsibilities that go with the
[1:49:12] position
[1:49:14] we've taken a position
[1:49:18] haven't we we've taken the position
[1:49:22] of i'm elected we've taken the position
[1:49:26] i'm called out we've taken the position
[1:49:29] of i i i'm the bride of christ
[1:49:33] well he said any marriage it's got
[1:49:36] responsibility
[1:49:38] you've got responsibilities to wipe the
[1:49:40] fingerprints off
[1:49:42] the wall when somebody does something in
[1:49:44] this message it's our responsibility
[1:49:46] to wipe those fingerprints off of it
[1:49:48] love hides a multitude of sin
[1:49:51] there's all kinds of responsibilities
[1:49:53] that go with our testimony
[1:49:58] and we're not going to go forward that's
[1:50:01] right
[1:50:02] until we come face to face
[1:50:06] with it we're not going to go forward
[1:50:10] individually until we come face to face
[1:50:13] with the situations and the complexity
[1:50:16] of our lives
[1:50:17] and we come face to face and say i've
[1:50:19] come face to face with this
[1:50:21] that i can overcome this
[1:50:25] this is what i need to overcome
[1:50:29] and it becomes a simplicity of it
[1:50:33] you've got to face the responsibility of
[1:50:36] what you've been called to do
[1:50:41] but if if you just thought you're going
[1:50:44] to join this thing
[1:50:47] and there's no responsibility
[1:50:50] i'm not responsibility of the local body
[1:50:53] fine
[1:50:53] he who says he's not a part of the body
[1:50:55] is
[1:50:57] not a part of the body that's right
[1:51:00] you want to say i'm just going to go my
[1:51:02] own way i'm going to believe my own
[1:51:04] thing i'm going to do my own thing
[1:51:06] because there was one other guy in the
[1:51:08] bible i knew was like that
[1:51:10] right it was a guy called
[1:51:13] cain i'm not my brother's keeper
[1:51:20] i've got no responsibility it doesn't it
[1:51:23] doesn't
[1:51:24] come with it the only turf i'm
[1:51:27] responsible
[1:51:28] is for my turf
[1:51:31] welcome you know
[1:51:36] there's a cry don't you see in our
[1:51:38] hearts all of us are crying to overcome
[1:51:41] we want to do better we want to have
[1:51:43] victory we want to put
[1:51:44] lust behind us we want to put worry
[1:51:47] behind us
[1:51:48] we want to put things behind us we want
[1:51:50] to put the dread of the future behind us
[1:51:53] all these things that we're desiring and
[1:51:55] we're crying out to overcome
[1:51:57] the spirit of the lord speaking back to
[1:51:59] us you want to overcome
[1:52:02] start taking responsibility
[1:52:07] don't short your responsibility
[1:52:11] don't walk away from your responsibility
[1:52:14] to your family
[1:52:15] don't walk away from your responsibility
[1:52:17] to your neighbor
[1:52:18] don't walk away from responsibility
[1:52:21] don't shirk the responsibility
[1:52:23] face up to it
[1:52:28] because it's in the facing up to it
[1:52:33] that you can deal with it how many times
[1:52:37] have you heard people say the first step
[1:52:39] to
[1:52:40] getting rid of the problem is to admit
[1:52:42] that you have one
[1:52:47] you know and and what is our definition
[1:52:49] of a sanity
[1:52:51] to keep doing the same thing over and
[1:52:54] over again thinking you're going to come
[1:52:55] up with a different result
[1:52:58] you keep shirking responsibility you
[1:53:00] could you don't come face to face with
[1:53:03] the problems
[1:53:03] you see what he said you just let it
[1:53:06] flow down the river
[1:53:08] you take the easy way you step around it
[1:53:11] you don't
[1:53:12] you you don't come and meet it face to
[1:53:14] face you don't deal with it
[1:53:16] whether it's a complex
[1:53:20] whether it's a bad feeling
[1:53:24] you see we've got we as human beings we
[1:53:26] just
[1:53:27] blow it off we blow this off we blow
[1:53:29] that off
[1:53:30] and pretty soon we got a great big pile
[1:53:32] of things that we've blowed off
[1:53:34] and guess what they do they find you
[1:53:43] i tried to go make something right with
[1:53:45] the brother i don't know if i
[1:53:47] i did the right thing i prayed and
[1:53:49] prayed and i came up with
[1:53:51] all kinds of plans
[1:53:54] but how i was gonna make it right and
[1:53:57] how i was gonna
[1:53:59] fix it and
[1:54:02] this thing bothered me for years
[1:54:06] i'm not talking one year two year
[1:54:10] i'm talking years
[1:54:13] and i i come to find out one day that
[1:54:16] this
[1:54:16] thing is still in my life and it's
[1:54:22] something i got
[1:54:23] to make right now the brother he didn't
[1:54:26] even probably even
[1:54:27] know it was bothering me but what i
[1:54:30] found out is i couldn't
[1:54:32] put it away
[1:54:36] and no matter how far down the road i
[1:54:38] went
[1:54:39] this bag was still in my trunk
[1:54:45] and every time i'd open my trunk there
[1:54:48] it is
[1:54:49] there it is and finally said one day why
[1:54:52] don't you
[1:54:53] just make this right
[1:54:56] well i don't want to face up to the fact
[1:54:59] that what i did was wrong
[1:55:06] now i thought it was good what i did
[1:55:10] sure i thought i did a great thing
[1:55:15] but i didn't have permission
[1:55:18] i ventured without authority
[1:55:22] but it stuck with me
[1:55:26] you know ten years later i finally say
[1:55:29] you know something i need to make this
[1:55:31] right
[1:55:33] so i had a plan how i was going to make
[1:55:35] it right
[1:55:36] but the plan didn't include confession
[1:55:44] it just included penance
[1:55:50] i'll just give a gift i'll make it right
[1:55:55] no confession no admitting fault
[1:55:58] no admitting i was wrong i didn't want
[1:56:01] to face it
[1:56:03] because it embarrassed me
[1:56:09] it embarrassed me supposedly being the
[1:56:11] preacher and me supposedly doing this
[1:56:13] and that
[1:56:14] it embarrassed me but finally i sat down
[1:56:17] i wrote a letter i said i was wrong
[1:56:21] i shouldn't have done it this is the way
[1:56:24] it is
[1:56:28] and i made it right
[1:56:34] i thought how many other things
[1:56:38] that i failed to face up to
[1:56:42] and then a prophet of god said that's
[1:56:44] the way we are
[1:56:48] but we're not going to overcome
[1:56:53] the way to overcome
[1:56:57] is to face up jonah didn't want to face
[1:57:00] it
[1:57:01] noah he had to face the fact
[1:57:05] that he was preaching an unscientific
[1:57:10] message in a scientific age
[1:57:13] that's what he had to come
[1:57:16] he had to come to reality
[1:57:20] with that's what he had
[1:57:24] to to face up he had to face the fact
[1:57:28] he had to come down and take a look at
[1:57:31] it
[1:57:32] face to face can you put up
[1:57:35] a paragraph 100 in in
[1:57:39] a man running from the presence of the
[1:57:42] lord
[1:57:44] and uh and you know if we went to
[1:57:48] paragraph
[1:57:50] 99 you you can just uh
[1:57:53] uh you know you can just see
[1:57:57] here that of what that the prophet of
[1:58:00] god's
[1:58:01] laying down so i'll start to read and
[1:58:04] then he'll find this he said
[1:58:08] he says
[1:58:12] he says every man had to face up
[1:58:16] to that that's got a responsibility
[1:58:19] before god
[1:58:20] we just take for instance noah
[1:58:24] he had noah moses elijah and all the
[1:58:28] rest of them
[1:58:29] of every age had to face
[1:58:32] up to the responsibility
[1:58:35] and they had to do it but that's the
[1:58:39] reason
[1:58:39] they were sent in the hour
[1:58:43] in paragraph 100 look at noah
[1:58:46] in his scientific age
[1:58:50] how he had to face up to a thing
[1:58:54] that was so unscientific
[1:59:00] why there wasn't a reason why it
[1:59:03] couldn't
[1:59:04] could be unscientific it was
[1:59:09] unscientific rather
[1:59:11] they said it's going to rain out of the
[1:59:14] sky
[1:59:15] they never had rain drop out of heavens
[1:59:18] now he had to face up to it
[1:59:21] god said it was going to rain
[1:59:27] you do you understand he had to face up
[1:59:29] to it
[1:59:30] well we've got to face up to the fact
[1:59:32] that god
[1:59:33] sent a messenger it's not popular
[1:59:37] it's not religious
[1:59:40] but you you've got to face up to it
[1:59:43] you've got to face up to the fact that
[1:59:45] you've been
[1:59:46] called out to be separate and to be
[1:59:48] different
[1:59:49] now you're not like the world you can't
[1:59:51] keep trying to take this message
[1:59:54] and fit it into the world
[1:59:58] you can't you can't say you can't make
[2:00:02] it be anything other than it is
[2:00:05] right you've got to face up
[2:00:08] to the responsibility of your calling
[2:00:14] and of your segregation
[2:00:17] from the world and of your being called
[2:00:21] out
[2:00:21] you've got to upset the responsibility
[2:00:24] of the fact that you are different
[2:00:27] the prophet god said we're not like the
[2:00:29] rest of the world
[2:00:30] we're different you have to understand
[2:00:33] we don't
[2:00:34] have the same gospel of every age
[2:00:37] we're not preaching jesus christ of
[2:00:39] nazareth
[2:00:40] we're preaching jesus christ of today
[2:00:43] [Applause]
[2:00:49] we've got to we've got to accept
[2:00:52] the responsibility of the capstone
[2:00:58] the love of god being the shed abroad in
[2:01:00] our heart by the holy spirit
[2:01:02] what's that mean the responsibility of
[2:01:05] of taking on people's feelings taking on
[2:01:08] people's burdens
[2:01:10] being a part of a body ministering one
[2:01:12] to another
[2:01:13] every joint fitted and joined together
[2:01:16] serving one another
[2:01:20] we're more responsible
[2:01:23] to the world than we are to god
[2:01:26] sometimes
[2:01:29] we've got to let him in every door
[2:01:33] every door in our life we've got to open
[2:01:36] up we've got them and that's our
[2:01:37] responsibility
[2:01:41] mikasa sukasa
[2:01:47] my house is your house yes behold i
[2:01:50] stand at the door knock if you let me in
[2:01:54] well there's a responsibility that goes
[2:01:57] with letting them in that's right
[2:01:59] confessing he's been there
[2:02:03] let's just continue reading this
[2:02:04] hundredth paragraph and this is
[2:02:06] and we'll close here it says
[2:02:11] he says now he had to face up god said
[2:02:14] it was going to reign
[2:02:16] then faith without works is dead
[2:02:21] i believe it and don't
[2:02:24] make no act just like the message
[2:02:30] if you say i believe it and don't make
[2:02:33] an
[2:02:33] act what good does it do
[2:02:37] noah went to work with this hammer and
[2:02:40] built an ark
[2:02:41] to confirm what he was talking about
[2:02:45] that's what we
[2:02:47] have to do
[2:02:51] we have to go to work and prove our
[2:02:54] faith
[2:02:55] by our works our works prove our faith
[2:03:03] i mean you take you know moses
[2:03:07] he had to he had to face the fact
[2:03:10] that god called him to go down to the
[2:03:13] biggest civilization
[2:03:14] the greatest military might in the world
[2:03:17] with a stick
[2:03:23] all's god's asking you to do is go face
[2:03:26] lady oseah
[2:03:30] the darkest most corrupt
[2:03:34] perverted age of time
[2:03:40] stand right up in the face of it all
[2:03:44] and say he's the same yesterday today
[2:03:46] and forever
[2:03:48] he still heals he still delivers he's
[2:03:51] still cast out devils
[2:03:53] i may not be the one to cast out devil's
[2:03:56] friend i might not have that gift but if
[2:03:58] you'll come down to church next week
[2:04:00] we'll have the elders of the church lay
[2:04:02] hands on you
[2:04:03] and and again if you believe in your
[2:04:06] heart and they believe in their heart
[2:04:08] that thing will leave you
[2:04:13] you can't do anything if you don't
[2:04:14] believe in it
[2:04:17] another look if you're going to have a
[2:04:18] testimony you take on the responsibility
[2:04:23] of that you can't have a lukewarm wait
[2:04:26] and see
[2:04:27] well let's pray for you and see what god
[2:04:29] does
[2:04:30] no you've got to take the responsibility
[2:04:33] i'm going to pray for you because
[2:04:34] i believe you're going to get well
[2:04:37] because god said so
[2:04:38] i'm willing to take the responsibility
[2:04:41] of the testimony
[2:04:42] of laying my hands on you i'm willing to
[2:04:45] take the testimony
[2:04:46] and the responsibility that god will
[2:04:49] stand behind the fact
[2:04:51] when i said he sent a messenger i can
[2:04:54] prove it by this word
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:05:01] but we're not overcoming
[2:05:04] because the responsibility side of it
[2:05:08] is what we're shrinking from
[2:05:13] that's what we kind of do we take the
[2:05:15] easy way
[2:05:18] i know the best way not to get into a
[2:05:20] confrontation is not to say anything
[2:05:29] i just won't deal with it
[2:05:33] well how are you going to handle this
[2:05:37] just walk away it'll go away
[2:05:42] guess what it don't go away
[2:05:49] how to trade places brother you ought to
[2:05:51] come up here and take over
[2:05:56] the the that's
[2:06:00] that that's the victory so we're
[2:06:03] starting to see that these men
[2:06:04] they had to face things noah had moses
[2:06:08] had to a face i'm going to go down there
[2:06:09] with a stick
[2:06:15] so i'm going to do where are you going
[2:06:18] moses take over
[2:06:20] egypt see we hear that story
[2:06:24] and i thought brother mike's uh
[2:06:27] exhortation this morning
[2:06:28] was so perfect we make everything
[2:06:32] so supernatural and all the bible
[2:06:36] stories so pontific
[2:06:38] that that we don't understand that these
[2:06:41] are real men
[2:06:43] moses agonized 40 years
[2:06:47] in the desert until it ate him alive
[2:06:51] and he said i'm taking the stick and i'm
[2:06:53] going down there
[2:06:55] why because there was a cry in his heart
[2:06:57] to overcome
[2:06:59] and he overcome when he faced the
[2:07:01] responsibility
[2:07:05] that's when he overcame
[2:07:08] when he went down there and he faced it
[2:07:10] face to face
[2:07:12] he got to work
[2:07:17] after he faced the responsibility
[2:07:20] he got to work
[2:07:23] that's what he did he put his wife on
[2:07:27] the
[2:07:28] donkey went down there
[2:07:32] he had to face his failures before he
[2:07:35] had to fake
[2:07:36] everything all the mess he made all the
[2:07:38] times that he testified that
[2:07:40] that he was number one and he fell flat
[2:07:43] in his face
[2:07:44] all this history he had to face it all
[2:07:49] and he had to deal with his present
[2:07:51] tense condition
[2:07:52] and face up to it
[2:07:55] and get to work you look at jesus
[2:08:01] jesus could have saved himself
[2:08:07] he could have taken some other path
[2:08:11] some other way
[2:08:14] he done all the good works in all those
[2:08:18] miracles
[2:08:21] he could have said well i did all these
[2:08:23] things isn't that good enough to redeem
[2:08:25] him
[2:08:29] he didn't he didn't provide remember a
[2:08:32] one-man denomination
[2:08:34] the evidence of a one-man denomination
[2:08:36] he pews his own sister and
[2:08:38] out he builds his own plan he's got his
[2:08:41] own way of going about it he's got his
[2:08:44] own belief systems
[2:08:45] he's got all his own little way he
[2:08:47] catches the spirit
[2:08:48] but what happens with all those ways
[2:08:52] they get wiggle tales they get corrupted
[2:08:54] look at
[2:08:55] all the times that you haven't faced up
[2:08:58] to the very thing you're dealing with
[2:09:00] and come face to face with it
[2:09:02] and you build some other system that
[2:09:05] thing's in it
[2:09:06] plus seven other devils
[2:09:13] and it's better just to get down to
[2:09:16] business
[2:09:23] jesus could have saved himself
[2:09:29] but then he couldn't have saved us
[2:09:34] he could have come up with some other
[2:09:35] way
[2:09:38] but then we would have never known what
[2:09:39] we've got
[2:09:41] standing with us he had to
[2:09:44] face the responsibility
[2:09:48] that he was called
[2:09:52] for this purpose for this cause i have
[2:09:55] come into the world
[2:10:00] this is what my responsibility is my
[2:10:03] responsibility is to take these
[2:10:05] stripes so they can be healed
[2:10:09] to take these nails for the chastisement
[2:10:12] of their sins i've got to go through the
[2:10:16] death before i can resurrect
[2:10:20] i've got to face the responsibility
[2:10:23] before
[2:10:24] i can resurrect and in closing i will
[2:10:29] add this you can't
[2:10:33] overcome just by stopping
[2:10:36] and quitting
[2:10:42] you can't noah couldn't have overcome
[2:10:47] just by saying it's going to rain
[2:10:52] you can't overcome just by saying i'm
[2:10:54] not going to do this anymore
[2:10:57] i'm not going to do it i'm not going to
[2:11:00] say another bad thing about somebody
[2:11:02] i am not going to eat mashed potatoes
[2:11:04] anymore
[2:11:05] i am not going to do this i am not going
[2:11:08] to do that
[2:11:12] you'll never get the victory that way
[2:11:15] and i know this isn't a great message
[2:11:17] this morning about the seven horse
[2:11:19] riders and the
[2:11:20] seven church ages and and the son of man
[2:11:23] ministry
[2:11:25] which i would say those things we know
[2:11:30] but let us move on to perfection
[2:11:34] let's really ask ourselves is there a
[2:11:36] call in me
[2:11:38] is the holy spirit really put a call is
[2:11:40] there really a call in me
[2:11:43] to overcome i really desire to overcome
[2:11:47] and the spirit comes back and whispers
[2:11:49] you want to overcome
[2:11:51] first of all take on the
[2:11:53] responsibilities
[2:11:55] that you've been shirking for so long
[2:12:00] reading your bible praying visiting the
[2:12:04] fatherless
[2:12:04] and the widows in their affliction
[2:12:08] going the extra mile lay for yourselves
[2:12:11] a pattern of good works
[2:12:16] sometimes we shrink shirk from the
[2:12:20] responsibilities of baker seek
[2:12:22] christianity
[2:12:23] and we cover it up with the fact that
[2:12:26] we've got a revelation of a pillar of
[2:12:28] fire
[2:12:29] when the man with the message
[2:12:34] was always doing good for people
[2:12:43] the lord went about doing good works
[2:12:49] the scripture says that we are his
[2:12:52] workmanship
[2:12:54] in christ jesus foreordained under good
[2:12:57] works
[2:12:58] that we should walk in them but you
[2:13:00] can't you you can't
[2:13:01] give up the responsibility and
[2:13:04] substitute it with the works
[2:13:09] you can't do good to make up for
[2:13:13] the little black spot in your life
[2:13:18] or that little evil part of your nature
[2:13:21] you can't out-good the evil
[2:13:30] i have a really nice white shirt on and
[2:13:33] if i sit there and i
[2:13:34] look down there and there's a little
[2:13:36] blue pin spot
[2:13:37] where i stuck my pin in my pocket
[2:13:43] so what will i do i'll just keep my coat
[2:13:45] button
[2:13:47] and then guess what i forget
[2:13:54] and
[2:13:57] there it is sure enough it gets exposed
[2:14:04] what i got to do one day one day i've
[2:14:07] got to say
[2:14:08] i've got an ink spot on this shirt i've
[2:14:11] either got to replace it
[2:14:13] or i've got to go bleach it out or find
[2:14:16] a new pocket and have it sewed on
[2:14:18] but i can't this shirt will never be
[2:14:21] what it's supposed to be until i deal
[2:14:24] with that spot and come face to face
[2:14:27] with
[2:14:27] it
[2:14:32] and if we get a life pattern of we just
[2:14:36] skip this one and skip that one and so
[2:14:38] we start to look and see how people feel
[2:14:41] about us
[2:14:41] you know what how do you feel about
[2:14:43] yourself
[2:14:48] yes sir so i want to say this
[2:14:52] you can't overcome by just quitting or
[2:14:55] stopping
[2:14:57] i'm never gonna do this again i'm never
[2:14:59] gonna do that again
[2:15:01] that'll never work you've got
[2:15:05] to replace it with something
[2:15:11] you've got to replace what you're
[2:15:14] quitting
[2:15:15] or what you're doing away with with
[2:15:18] something else
[2:15:22] if you've got a real bad problem
[2:15:24] gossiping
[2:15:25] you just don't say i'm going to quit
[2:15:27] gossiping i'm going to quit gossiping
[2:15:30] and sit around on the couch one
[2:15:38] you're just dying to say something
[2:15:42] you ain't overcome
[2:15:47] you're bearing it all within your spirit
[2:15:49] there's no freedom
[2:15:52] you know you're packing it you know
[2:15:54] you're there
[2:15:55] it's there maybe you got it not to rear
[2:15:58] up its
[2:15:59] ugly head but you haven't done away with
[2:16:02] it
[2:16:05] but you've condemned it to the closet
[2:16:09] you stay in there you don't come out
[2:16:11] anymore you quit you quit you
[2:16:14] quit and you know what it's doing it's
[2:16:16] just waiting for the day
[2:16:18] that it can open that handle and show up
[2:16:22] 10 years later yeah it'll show up
[2:16:26] but you can't you've got to face it
[2:16:30] and then when you come face to face with
[2:16:32] it and you realize
[2:16:34] i've got this problem i'm just using
[2:16:36] gossip because i know nobody in here has
[2:16:38] that problem
[2:16:42] you got to replace it with something
[2:16:46] you've got to replace it with saying
[2:16:49] nice things
[2:16:51] finding good things to say about
[2:16:53] somebody talking about
[2:16:55] people what qualities they have you know
[2:16:58] creating a nice atmosphere
[2:17:02] if if the scripture says if thou steal
[2:17:06] steal no more is that the end of that
[2:17:10] scripture
[2:17:12] if you stole steal no
[2:17:15] more quit stealing
[2:17:19] it's not what it says it says but work
[2:17:22] with your hands
[2:17:24] labor that thou mayest give
[2:17:29] you see look you can't overcome so
[2:17:33] what i'm saying this morning i hope that
[2:17:35] i can reach out in my
[2:17:37] uneducated vocabulary but the
[2:17:40] spirit is calling us
[2:17:43] and creating in us a desire to overcome
[2:17:47] so with this great desire to overcome we
[2:17:50] need to walk up and say
[2:17:51] how do i obtain what the holy spirit is
[2:17:54] calling me to do and the spirit comes
[2:17:56] back and says
[2:17:57] take responsibility
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:02] and replace those
[2:18:06] things that you want out of your life
[2:18:08] with something else
[2:18:10] in your life
[2:18:16] even in the carnal diets
[2:18:19] if you're going to give up something
[2:18:21] they tell you replace it with this
[2:18:26] you're going to give up potatoes replace
[2:18:27] it with broccoli
[2:18:30] if you're going to give up hamburgers
[2:18:34] replace it with a fish
[2:18:38] or whatever this isn't a life
[2:18:43] of not doing
[2:18:46] it's a life of doing and the
[2:18:50] only reason we're backslid in the first
[2:18:53] place
[2:18:54] is because we shirk the responsibilities
[2:18:58] that we've had and we've got a whole
[2:19:01] life
[2:19:02] pattern of walking away from things
[2:19:07] leaving things undone and the spirit of
[2:19:10] god
[2:19:12] has called out this people and it's
[2:19:15] telling us it's time
[2:19:16] that we get down to business it's time
[2:19:20] that we re face the responsibilities our
[2:19:23] testimonies what we've been called to be
[2:19:26] and what we've been called to do
[2:19:28] come face to face with our iniquities
[2:19:30] and start replacing the bad
[2:19:34] with good and we'll start
[2:19:37] living and having an overcoming life
[2:19:41] when you want to be healed all you want
[2:19:43] to do is replace the sickness with what
[2:19:47] health you just don't want the sickness
[2:19:51] to go away
[2:19:52] you want to be healthy
[2:19:56] so you want to overcome but you want to
[2:19:59] you know
[2:20:00] you got to know what you want to be and
[2:20:03] you've got to know what you've got to
[2:20:04] change
[2:20:05] and you've got to replace what you want
[2:20:09] to change
[2:20:10] with what you want to be and you've got
[2:20:13] to start bringing that into reality
[2:20:17] works and real living and when we all
[2:20:21] take that responsibility
[2:20:23] that we have one to another we will
[2:20:26] start moving forward
[2:20:28] like we've never moved forward before
[2:20:31] and they'll know that you are my
[2:20:33] disciples
[2:20:35] by your love one for another
[2:20:38] god bless you this morning beautiful
[2:20:40] message
[2:20:41] i'd running from the presence of the
[2:20:44] lord is running
[2:20:47] from your responsibility and good works
[2:20:50] is taking up your responsibility
[2:20:54] it all works hand-in-hand god bless you
[2:20:56] the musicians would come
[2:20:58] let us stand this morning
[2:21:04] maybe with our heads bowed or our heart
[2:21:06] spout before the lord
[2:21:08] and and you would
[2:21:12] just take a moment to
[2:21:18] ask yourself
[2:21:22] if you've had certain feelings or
[2:21:23] certain thoughts in your heart and your
[2:21:25] life
[2:21:27] certain things in your life that you've
[2:21:29] left undone and
[2:21:34] certain
[2:21:37] maybe even certain failures that you've
[2:21:39] never really
[2:21:40] went to the lord with and had a real
[2:21:44] one-on-one conversation
[2:21:48] and you realize that the greatest step
[2:21:52] to fulfill the call in your heart is to
[2:21:55] come face to face
[2:21:59] face to face with your own reality
[2:22:04] face to face with your own weakness
[2:22:10] just say lord i'm here just the way that

[2:34:11] i
[2:34:15] bring jackson if we could just come in
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:24] you appreciate the message this morning
[2:34:28] struck me as brother david said he could
[2:34:29] have set up here and
[2:34:31] preached on things that maybe we thought
[2:34:33] were mysteries things that sometimes we
[2:34:35] put far out there
[2:34:37] but sometimes when the rubber meets the
[2:34:38] road and it's those things that hit the
[2:34:40] heart
[2:34:41] that mean the most and i can appreciate
[2:34:43] that brother david
[2:34:45] let's pray heavenly father lord we
[2:34:48] come to you this morning lord believing
[2:34:50] that you spoke to us
[2:34:52] or believing that you were searching the
[2:34:54] doors within our hearts
[2:34:56] lord we know that we've been taught that
[2:34:58] if we want to expose the devil or we
[2:35:00] must confess it
[2:35:02] lord we know it within ourselves we know
[2:35:04] that you know it
[2:35:05] but when we confess it lord it gives him
[2:35:07] no ground that he can operate on
[2:35:10] lord i ask that you would search the
[2:35:11] hearts this morning lord if there's
[2:35:13] things in our life that we need to make
[2:35:15] right
[2:35:16] lord may we not be embarrassed may we
[2:35:17] not worry about what someone else would
[2:35:20] think
[2:35:20] lord but it's only going to draw this
[2:35:22] body closer
[2:35:24] to one another lord and closer to you
[2:35:26] lord we know it's a sacrifice sometimes
[2:35:28] we know that there's things that can be
[2:35:30] contentious there's things that we don't
[2:35:32] want to speak of and we want to skirt
[2:35:34] the issue
[2:35:34] lord we ask that as a body and we're
[2:35:36] trying to come up higher
[2:35:38] lord even as brother david just said
[2:35:40] there's there's a cry to overcome
[2:35:42] lord may you just go and walk the pews
[2:35:44] and let your holy spirit
[2:35:46] but we heard that it hunts out the
[2:35:47] people this morning and it hunts us out
[2:35:50] lord for the things that we need to make
[2:35:51] right
[2:35:53] or deal with our hearts or meet us in
[2:35:55] that secret place or do we know that
[2:35:58] you can find and search us and or we can
[2:36:00] come out and
[2:36:01] do the things that we know that are
[2:36:02] right or this is a church that's on fire
[2:36:05] it's a church that wants to come higher
[2:36:07] lord we're asking that you would deal
[2:36:08] with each individual lord may they play
[2:36:10] their part
[2:36:11] we commit all things into your hands
[2:36:13] lord we love you we ask these things in
[2:36:14] jesus name
[2:36:15] amen
[2:36:20] amen amen don't forget about the meeting
[2:36:22] in the back god bless you are dismissed
