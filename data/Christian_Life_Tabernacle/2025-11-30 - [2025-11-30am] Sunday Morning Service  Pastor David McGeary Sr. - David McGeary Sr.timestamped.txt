[4:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:09] &gt;&gt; and sing this song.
[4:14] Oh,
[4:16] you were [singing and music] the word of
[4:18] the beginning,
[4:22] one with God [singing and music]
[4:26] most high.
[4:32] We're here to [music] glory in creation.
[4:38] I reveal
[4:41] you
[4:43] Christ. What a beautiful day [music]
[4:46] it is.
[4:48] What a beautiful [singing] day it is.
[4:52] Oh, and
[4:54] Jesus [music and singing]
[4:56] Christ might.
[4:59] Oh, [music and singing]
[5:00] what a beautiful day it is.
[5:04] And nothing less.
[5:08] What a beautiful name [music] it is
[5:13] the heart of [singing] Jesus.
[5:19] Oh, you didn't [music and singing] want
[5:21] heaven without us.
[5:25] Jesus, you are never. [music]
[5:34] Oh, my sin was great and [music] love
[5:38] was greater.
[5:41] And what good? [music]
[5:45] [singing]
[5:48] What a wonderful name [music] it is. Oh,
[5:52] what a wonderful name it is.
[5:56] The [music and singing] name of Jesus
[6:00] Christ [singing] might.
[6:03] Oh, what [music] a wonderful day it is.
[6:08] Nothing.
[6:11] What a wonderful day it [music] is. The
[6:15] name of Jesus.
[6:19] And [music and singing] death could not
[6:21] hold true.
[6:24] fell on before [music]
[6:26] you
[6:28] silence flowers
[6:31] are seated [music]
[6:32] and praise.
[6:35] Heaven [singing]
[6:36] for
[6:39] the [music] praise of your glory
[6:46] to [singing] life [music] again. You
[6:49] have no right. You have no [singing]
[6:52] right.
[6:55] You have no equal [music]
[6:59] now and [singing] forever.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Yours is [music] the kingdom. Yours is
[7:07] [singing] the kingom.
[7:11] Yours is [music] the glory.
[7:14] Yours is the name
[7:18] of the [music] holy. What a powerful
[7:21] day. What a powerful [singing]
[7:23] day it is.
[7:26] What a powerful [music]
[7:27] day.
[7:30] The name of Jesus
[7:34] Christ [music and singing] might be
[7:35] king. Oh, what a powerful name it is
[7:41] that we can [music] stand against.
[7:45] What a powerful day. [music]
[7:49] The name of Jesus.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful name. What a beautiful
[7:54] name it is. [music]
[7:57] &gt;&gt; What a [singing] beautiful name it is.
[8:01] The name [music]
[8:02] of Jesus
[8:05] Christ my king. [music] Oh, what a
[8:09] beautiful name it is. [music]
[8:13] Nothing else for this.
[8:17] What a beautiful name it is [music]
[8:20] the name of Jesus.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Saints, I'm trust we're all
[8:30] happy to be in this house [music]
[8:31] tonight this morning. Feeling a bit
[8:34] under the weather. You pray for [music]
[8:35] me that God keeps me. We'll ask brother
[8:37] Clever to come and open our service in a
[8:38] word of prayer.
[8:48] Gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[8:50] for the opportunity to be in your house
[8:52] this morning. And Lord, we we thank you
[8:56] for
[8:58] good health. We thank you, Lord, for um
[9:01] yet another chance, Lord, to [music]
[9:03] hear from thee, Lord, and that you may
[9:06] prepare our hearts for your soon coming.
[9:08] And we pray for those that are on the
[9:10] way and maybe those that couldn't make
[9:12] it. [music] And Lord, may the word today
[9:15] speak in a personal way to each one.
[9:18] Lord, you know all things. You know our
[9:21] requests before we even bring them.
[9:23] [music] And you've already made a way,
[9:25] Lord, be before we ask. And so we pray,
[9:28] Father, that you may minister to each
[9:29] need, those that are sick in the body,
[9:32] that you may touch [music] them, Lord.
[9:34] those that need any financial
[9:36] assistance, whatever it may be, Lord,
[9:38] thou knowest. We pray even for the
[9:40] singing of songs. [music] May each song,
[9:42] Lord, be inspired, Lord, to prepare our
[9:45] hearts for your word. Um, and we put the
[9:49] remainder of the service into your
[9:50] hands. And may we ask for your [music]
[9:54] will and for your way. In the name of
[9:56] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While we're [music]
[10:02] standing, we'll just turn to our psalm
[10:04] reading. Read out of Psalm 122. You may
[10:07] turn around and shake someone's hand.
[10:28] We'll read it together all the way down
[10:30] to the ninth verse. Starting with the
[10:31] first,
[10:33] it reads, "I was glad when they said
[10:36] unto me, let us go into the house of the
[10:39] Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy
[10:42] gates, oh Jerusalem. Jerusalem is built
[10:45] as a city that is compact together,
[10:48] whether the tribes go up, the tribes of
[10:51] the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel,
[10:54] to give thanks unto the name of the
[10:56] Lord. For there are set thrones of
[10:58] judgment, and thrones of the house of
[11:00] David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
[11:04] They shall prosper that love thee. Peace
[11:06] be within thy walls, and prosperity
[11:09] within thy palaces. For my brethren and
[11:12] companion's sakes, I will now say,
[11:15] "Peace be within thee." Because of the
[11:18] house of the Lord our God, I will seek
[11:20] thy good. Amen. You may be seated.
[11:25] Believe key of F.
[11:31] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[11:34] And time [singing]
[11:36] is filled [music] with swift transition.
[11:43] And none [singing]
[11:45] [music] of earth
[11:47] can stand.
[11:50] Oh, [music and singing] and build
[11:53] your hope. Something eternal. [music]
[11:59] Oh, [singing] you got to hold
[12:03] a unchanging man.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; [music]

[12:11] God's unchanging
[12:13] God's unchanging hand. Oh, and hold
[12:20] God unchanging. [music]
[12:25] Oh, and [music]

[12:29] only.

[12:36] to God's unchanging hand. Trust in him.
[12:41] [music]
[12:42] Oh, and trust
[12:45] in him with nothing.
[12:51] who [music and singing] and whatsoever
[12:55] may bring
[13:00] and
[13:02] [music and singing] my earthly friend
[13:04] forsake
[13:06] him. Oh, and [music and singing] still
[13:10] more closely to him. [music]
[13:15] Oh, you got a hold.
[13:18] You got [music] a changing hand.
[13:25] [music]
[13:28] That's a changing hand.
[13:32] Oh, [music]
[13:33] when we
[13:36] hold something.
[13:40] [music]
[13:41] Oh, you got a hold
[13:45] of Jing. [music]

[14:26] lot of chasing. God's unchanging.
[14:32] I've [music and singing] got a hold
[14:35] of you.

[15:24] unraured soul will.

[19:44] great
[19:48] rejoicing not again as I walk the narrow
[19:53] way for the coming
[19:56] [music]
[19:57] with me. And once my heart, once my
[20:01] heart was full of sin, once [music] I
[20:05] had no peace with me, till I found Jesus
[20:10] on [music and singing] the tree.
[20:13] Oh, that
[20:15] is sweet.
[20:18] cannot be so sweet [music] now.
[20:24] Oh,

[20:29] Oh, [music] he abide.
[20:32] Oh, and hallelujah.
[20:35] He [music] abides with me.

[20:48] among

[21:27] We are with me. [music]
[21:33] Rejoice in God indeed. As [music] I walk

[21:46] no thirsty for the things [music]
[21:49] of the world and taking place. All I

[22:02] learnings [music]
[22:04] away touch the cover of my way. Oh my.
[22:14] Oh

[22:17] Oh hallelujah.
[22:20] [music] We abide with me.
[22:25] I [music] can trust in God and as I walk
[22:29] the narrow way for the comfort abide
[22:35] with me. [music]
[22:36] He [singing] abides. He
[22:41] [music] Oh,
[22:45] [singing] hallelujah.
[22:48] with [music] me.
[22:51] I'm rejoicing that indeed as I walk the
[22:56] narrow way for [music] the comfort of
[23:00] God with me.
[23:05] Hallelujah.
[23:19] We have a prayer request. Sister
[23:21] Chipotashi writes, [music] "I am
[23:23] requesting prayer for an unspoken prayer
[23:26] request."
[23:27] Brother Jeff and Coob writes the same
[23:29] unspoken prayer request. You know, we've
[23:32] got a lot of unspoken prayer requests
[23:34] and then we have the ones that we tell
[23:36] others. But in all reality, whether
[23:38] unspoken or not, God knows. And we
[23:40] believe that. So if you came into his
[23:42] house and you've got a burden on your
[23:44] heart for something and you wanting the
[23:45] Lord to move upon, make it known to him
[23:48] by the uplifting of your hands. We'll
[23:50] ask brother Tim to come at this time.
[23:52] And the brothers who bring their tithes
[23:53] and offerings, please come up. I believe
[23:56] there's a Sunday school announcement for
[23:57] in between services.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brief announcement. There will be
[24:07] practice for the Christmas play between
[24:09] services. There'll be lunch provided for
[24:11] the children. So, uh, immediately
[24:13] following they can gather over there and
[24:15] then pick up by 4:00 this afternoon.
[24:19] [clears throat]
[24:20] You know, it was just like this behind
[24:21] closed doors
[24:24] after Jesus resurrected
[24:27] and the disciples were gathered.
[24:30] He didn't have to open a door or window.
[24:32] He came in their midst.
[24:37] And Thomas wasn't there the first time.
[24:41] He said, 'Oh, unless I touch the prince,
[24:44] the nails in his hands, thrust my hand
[24:46] into his side, I won't believe it.
[24:54] Jesus gave him an extra opportunity.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Eight days later, he came back again.
[25:01] If you read your Bible, he used the
[25:03] exact phrase Thomas did. I don't believe
[25:06] it's written in error. He touched the
[25:08] prince and I'll thrust my hands in the
[25:09] side. He came and told Thomas, look, do
[25:12] this [snorts]
[25:16] everyday terminology.
[25:18] The Godhead revealed. He said, "My Lord
[25:21] and my God."
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; The same one, Lord and God. That's who
[25:27] we're going to pray to right now.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for the
[25:31] opportunity. Lord, there may be
[25:36] a representative of Thomas here in our
[25:38] midst. Lord, [snorts]
[25:40] that's just borderline that's thinking.
[25:43] I believe it, but I'm not fully
[25:46] convinced.
[25:47] Lord, may you convince a heart today.
[25:50] [snorts] Convert us from within and
[25:52] without. Lord, if there be any
[25:54] misgivings or fears,
[25:57] Lord, may we fully recognize who you
[25:59] are.
[26:02] Lord, we ask that the requests that have
[26:05] been [snorts] spoken across this desk,
[26:07] Lord,
[26:09] they're very special unspoken needs,
[26:12] Lord. There's faith in our heart,
[26:14] believing that a combined faith, the
[26:16] prayer of the saints, Lord, can deliver
[26:20] the answer to their need. Lord, there's
[26:22] many upon our hearts. Lord, we cry out
[26:25] with earnest and [music] the groanings
[26:28] of our hearts. Lord, when we don't even
[26:29] know how to pray, you said there's a
[26:31] spirit that intercedes and recognizes
[26:34] the need.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[26:35] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we pray that you discern our
[26:37] thoughts and intents of our heart, Lord,
[26:39] and put you first, Lord, to get our
[26:42] families in and Lord, surely these these
[26:45] old frail and sick bodies, the pain, the
[26:48] discomfort, Lord, we just [snorts] lay
[26:50] it all on your altar today, Lord. ask
[26:52] you just relieve us of these symptoms,
[26:54] Lord, that we might glorify you a little
[26:56] greater, give you more praise. [snorts]
[26:59] And Lord, may we confirm once again that
[27:02] you are the healer of all our diseases,
[27:06] Lord. [snorts] Lord, but truly our main
[27:08] benefit and reason for coming, Lord, is
[27:10] the preaching of the word, Lord. We pray
[27:13] that the the [clears throat] revealed
[27:15] word can be like a sav Lord that just
[27:18] heals all of the deep wounds, the scars
[27:20] [snorts] and Lord refreshes us over
[27:22] again and Lord just drives out the
[27:25] enemy.
[27:26] We pray that you just have your will and
[27:29] way. [snorts] Use us for your honor and
[27:31] your glory.
[27:33] Lord, that we can say amen to everything
[27:37] that your prophet said.
[27:40] Lord, we ask that you just bless the
[27:42] tithes and the offering. Use it for your
[27:43] honor and glory as you see fit. And
[27:45] [snorts] Lord, truly prepare our hearts
[27:47] for that preaching of the word. We give
[27:49] you the honor, the glory, and the praise
[27:50] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [snorts]
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] I have this song on
[27:59] my heart. The greatest love story.
[28:11] I left the barren land
[28:15] searching [singing]
[28:17] for rest.
[28:19] Stumbling around [music]
[28:20] in amnesia,
[28:23] bitterness [singing] and distress. But
[28:26] then I met the kinsman redeemer
[28:30] [music and singing] who is called the
[28:32] mighty one. He took this old mobile
[28:35] [music and singing]
[28:36] from the field
[28:38] and to bring me to [music and singing]
[28:40] his house.
[28:43] He said, [music and singing] "Fear not
[28:46] my child, for you are part of me
[28:51] [singing] and I'll not [music] rest
[28:54] till you are at my side. [singing]
[28:59] And I'll do [music] all the king.
[29:03] that you
[29:05] love me. You are Jehovah,
[29:08] [singing and music] my heart,
[29:10] virtuous woman.
[29:13] Oh, you are [music] my pride.
[29:19] Sounded to your [music and singing]
[29:21] call.
[29:23] Oh, and you have covered me. [music]
[29:27] Open eyes of faith. I [singing] see
[29:31] all [music] the mysteries being
[29:32] revealed.
[29:34] And now [singing] I see who I am. And I
[29:39] [music] lay claim to all that's mine.
[29:42] I'm the lamb's wife. [music and singing]
[29:46] And I've been born with a cross.
[29:50] He [music] said, "Fear [singing] not my
[29:54] child.
[29:56] Oh, for you are [music]
[29:58] me and I
[30:02] to you are [music and singing] at my
[30:04] side.
[30:07] I do all that you
[30:11] [music] ask of me. Your tool [singing]
[30:15] in my eyes.
[30:18] virtuous [music]
[30:19] for
[30:21] you are [singing] my cry.

[37:11] gracious father,
[37:14] if that could become a reality
[37:17] that you're coming back.
[37:22] [music] The world doesn't believe it.
[37:25] They think they're going to Mars and
[37:29] they [music] think they're going to live
[37:30] in space and [snorts and crying]
[37:34] they think when they destroy this earth
[37:36] [music] that their science and
[37:39] technology is going to take them to
[37:41] other worlds and other [music] lands.
[37:43] And
[37:45] but Father, we're looking for
[37:48] a place so much [music] farther away
[37:51] than this universe.
[37:55] And we know that you're coming to take
[37:57] those that believe in you back to that
[37:59] place from whence we [music] came.
[38:03] We're grateful for that today. Father,
[38:06] as we endure this life here on earth and
[38:11] as we're tempted and tried,
[38:15] we're tested and [music]
[38:20] the sufferings that come our way.
[38:23] We just ask for your grace and your
[38:26] mercy to give us the strength to endure
[38:28] all things.
[38:30] And look up for we know our redemption
[38:34] [music] drawth nigh. Bless us this
[38:36] morning. We ask these things in Jesus
[38:40] precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[38:44] bless. You may be seated. [snorts]
[38:49] We
[38:50] we're going to do a baby dedication. So,
[38:54] don't run away.
[38:57] Amen. Uh, hope you had a wonderful
[39:00] Thanksgiving
[39:01] and uh your turkey was perfect and your
[39:05] mashed potatoes were creamy. [snorts]
[39:09] Your pumpkin pies were sweet
[39:11] and you're satisfied and and we trust
[39:15] that the word of God will satisfy us
[39:18] this morning. Amen. Uh we love the word
[39:22] of the Lord. But this morning we have a
[39:24] baby dedication and uh brother Caleb and
[39:28] Mida are going to dedicate their baby
[39:32] Moses and uh so um Moses Ephraim
[39:39] homeover. So uh brother Caleb and sister
[39:43] me are you here? If you're here, if
[39:46] you'd
[39:47] bring your
[39:50] baby. I don't
[39:54] Oh, here they come.
[39:58] [music]
[39:59] Let's sing that as they come.
[40:03] Amen. [singing and music]
[40:16] Oh, bring [music and singing]
[40:17] them in.
[40:20] Bring
[40:24] down.
[40:32] Hallelujah.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Look at you, sister. God bless you. I
[40:44] remember the days he's just looking for
[40:46] a wife so bad. And now he's married and
[40:49] has a baby. God's good is he. Amen. I
[40:54] like to read this little scripture. It
[40:56] says here, it says,
[40:59] "And then
[41:01] there brought unto him little children
[41:04] that he should put his hands on them and
[41:08] pray." And the disciples rebuked them.
[41:11] But Jesus said, "Suffer the little
[41:14] children and forbid them not to come
[41:18] unto me, for such is the kingdom of
[41:22] heaven." Amen. And and so that's what
[41:26] we're here to do today. And and uh
[41:30] Hi, buddy. Oh, you got to turn him and
[41:33] show him. He's a handsome little fella.
[41:43] You know, it it's a miracle how such
[41:45] beautiful things come come out of, you
[41:48] know, it just I didn't say it,
[41:53] but anyway, we're happy. So, we're going
[41:56] to ask you to bless your child and then
[41:58] we'll all join in and bless them,
[42:00] dedicate them to the Lord. Go ahead.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our blessed heavenly father,
[42:06] we are so grateful and thankful unto you
[42:09] for this great thing that you have done
[42:11] for us. Indeed, it is great and it is
[42:15] marvelous in our eyes and we give you
[42:18] all the uh appreciation. Heavenly
[42:21] Father, from the time you called your
[42:24] servant Abraham
[42:26] and told him that his seed will sen in a
[42:29] strange land, but after 400 years, you
[42:32] bring them out. You had your servant
[42:35] Moses in mind. And dear Lord Jesus,
[42:38] right from the time of his birth, it was
[42:40] you protecting him against an evil
[42:43] decree. And Lord Jesus, even when he was
[42:46] put on a crocodileinfested river, Lord
[42:50] Jesus, you protected him as well. When
[42:52] he came of age, your prophet would tell
[42:55] us that he made a decision, a choice by
[42:59] faith to serve you and to live for you.
[43:02] He had Egypt, the throne, beckoning at
[43:05] him. But he put all on one scale and
[43:08] threw it away. It is something that only
[43:11] your grace helped him to do. And Lord
[43:15] Jesus, we are praying this moment that
[43:17] that same grace that protected him from
[43:20] the time of birth and also helped him to
[43:23] make that correct choice be upon this
[43:25] child. Help him, oh Lord Jesus,
[43:28] regardless of every other pursuit in
[43:30] this life to make his primary goal and
[43:33] focus as living for you and serving you
[43:37] all the days of his life. Help us oh
[43:39] Lord Jesus as parents to provide the
[43:42] right environment for him to be good
[43:44] models to be good examples unto him.
[43:47] Help us Lord as a church body to live
[43:49] peaceably with him as well. Lord Jesus
[43:52] as many as are also waiting on you for
[43:55] this blessing. We pray that you visit
[43:57] them by their address and provide for
[44:00] them as well. We thank you. We bless
[44:02] your holy name in Jesus name I have
[44:04] prayed. Amen.
[44:06] Let's all bless a blessing. Our gracious
[44:08] heavenly father, we ask you to bless
[44:10] Moses this morning. Father, you'll see
[44:13] that all things are perfectly and well
[44:16] done. Be with him, Father, as we
[44:19] continue this service this morning. May
[44:23] the testimony of Moses be his. We ask it
[44:27] in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you so much. Be with
[44:33] you. Amen. and you love the Lord
[44:36] &gt;&gt; this morning. Well, [snorts]
[44:39] uh [music] you know God knows how to do
[44:42] all things well. You believe that? So
[44:46] [music] this morning, uh we're going to
[44:49] listen to by faith Moses.
[44:55] Now, I don't know if you believe in
[44:58] signs and I don't know if you believe in
[45:00] those things, but I do. God bless you.
[45:01] Thank you, musicians. Uh, I think it's a
[45:05] uh I I think it all things work together
[45:09] for the good,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; don't you? This is a marvelous little
[45:13] message.
[45:15] Uh, it was it was preached uh
[45:20] I I believe in in 1958.
[45:25] Uh
[45:26] uh yeah, July 20th, 1958. But you know,
[45:30] one thing I found out about the word, I
[45:33] don't know if I found it out, but I I
[45:36] realize it more and more. The word of
[45:38] God's eternal.
[45:40] And it doesn't matter when it was
[45:42] preached. You know, people will will try
[45:45] to put a date on the word of God, but
[45:47] you know, I pick up my Bible and I read
[45:51] in Genesis and and I don't know how many
[45:54] years ago that was written. And you
[45:57] know, and you know, sometimes people
[46:00] will they will say, "Well, you're
[46:02] following a message and your messenger
[46:05] left 50 years ago." But that that was
[46:09] just the time in time
[46:12] &gt;&gt; when he decided to bring the message.
[46:15] But the message is the eternal word of
[46:18] God. it it if it was preached whenever
[46:22] it was preached, it didn't matter the
[46:25] calendar time, it was still the truth.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And and it's the truth that sets you
[46:32] free. And [snorts] it it still it still
[46:35] speaks for itself. And I think that's
[46:39] what's so marvelous about the word of
[46:41] God is the word of God speaks for
[46:44] itself. And in other words, by that it
[46:47] actually vindicates itself by bringing
[46:50] to pass the very things that it says.
[46:55] And you you know and it how how can I I
[46:59] sit down and maybe read the book of
[47:02] Ephesians that Paul wrote to the church
[47:05] of Ephesus and I sit there and I read it
[47:08] and it just feeds my soul.
[47:12] You know it's you know it's it's it was
[47:15] actually not even written in all direct
[47:21] reality to me. In other words, it didn't
[47:24] say David, but I put my name in there.
[47:27] And [snorts] then I find out he wasn't
[47:29] just writing to the church. He was
[47:32] writing to the believer.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And once I put myself in the category of
[47:37] a believer, then that word is my
[47:41] possession.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; And and I I think that uh we we're going
[47:46] to listen to just 30 minutes. That's not
[47:48] too long. uh and it it and the message
[47:53] is called by faith. And and so we want
[47:57] to just minister a little bit this
[47:59] morning on faith. And so I was I was I
[48:04] was uh praying and and and
[48:08] meditating and thinking I I wanted to
[48:11] preach on faith. And so, you know, I I
[48:14] went over and I thought, you know, I I
[48:16] need to find a place and and th the this
[48:22] message
[48:24] was sitting right in the front of my
[48:26] books and it's never been there.
[48:31] You know what I mean? All my books start
[48:33] in ' 62 and right on in the front of my
[48:37] 1965 books was this message. and I don't
[48:42] know how it got there. And and so I
[48:45] thought, well, that's strange. And so I
[48:48] started reading it and I thought, "Oh,
[48:50] this is everything I wanted to bring
[48:53] out."
[48:55] &gt;&gt; You know, and so the Lord knows that I
[48:58] couldn't bring it out, so he got a
[49:01] prophet to bring it out for me. [snorts]
[49:04] And so if if uh uh you want to say that,
[49:08] well, as somebody told me, he said, the
[49:11] only reason you play tapes is you can't
[49:13] preach. And I got to thinking, yeah,
[49:15] [snorts] that's right. But when I play
[49:18] tapes, I'm playing the best preacher
[49:20] there is. So,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; you know, at least we're hearing the
[49:23] best preacher there is, you know, and
[49:25] and and so we'll enjoy that. So, I think
[49:27] that you'll enjoy this this morning. So,
[49:30] [snorts] we're going to listen to 30
[49:32] minutes. We'll go back and point out
[49:34] some things. And we hope this morning
[49:38] that
[49:40] we can come down to the the root core of
[49:47] what it is that we really have to start
[49:51] relying on to move forward. And uh and
[49:56] uh it it's marvelous. So, we're going to
[49:58] start by reading in the the 11th chapter
[50:02] of the uh book of Hebrews and um and uh
[50:08] and the and starting with the 23rd verse
[50:13] and and so we'll uh we'll listen to that
[50:18] uh Hebrews
[50:20] uh 23 and it starts out by faith Moses
[50:26] and and the little sermon title if some
[50:29] of you might be able to pull it up on
[50:31] your phones and read along. Uh [snorts]
[50:35] just as long as you put them or they
[50:37] won't go off. Uh by faith Moses. And so
[50:41] that's going to be the title sermon. And
[50:44] uh and we're going to start in the
[50:47] message from paragraph 33
[50:51] to the end of paragraph 84.
[50:56] And uh and I hope that that it's a
[51:00] blessing. The quality of the tape is
[51:02] pretty good. So I think that that part
[51:05] of it will be good. And we're just only
[51:07] asking you for just to be pay attention
[51:10] for 30 minutes. That's not long. And uh
[51:15] uh so I I I just trust that you'll be
[51:18] blessed this morning. So let's go to the
[51:20] Lord in prayer and ask him to bless us.
[51:23] our gracious father this morning.
[51:28] Lord, we know that without faith
[51:32] it's impossible to please you.
[51:36] And Lord, we in our hearts,
[51:41] we know that
[51:44] like the man that you were praying for
[51:48] his child and he finally looked at you
[51:51] in all earnest and he said, "Lord, help
[51:53] my unbelief."
[51:55] [snorts] Father, because we know that if
[51:58] we can believe, all things are possible.
[52:01] So this morning, Father, we ask that you
[52:03] would help our faith. give us a greater
[52:06] understanding of what faith is, what it
[52:10] does for us. It's the key to the door
[52:13] for every believer. It's the path
[52:16] forward for every believer. And so this
[52:19] morning, Father, with your goodness and
[52:22] kindness. We ask that you would revelate
[52:25] us this morning by speaking to us the
[52:28] eternal words of life. Bless each heart.
[52:32] May they be encouraged, Father. May they
[52:34] reach out this morning even while we're
[52:38] listening to this eternal word and touch
[52:41] the hem of your garment and claim all
[52:45] the heart's desires that they have. We
[52:48] ask that you'd grant this to us this
[52:50] morning in Jesus precious name we pray.
[52:54] Amen. God bless you this morning as we
[52:57] begin to listen to let us stand and as
[53:00] as we he reads the scriptures and then
[53:03] when he's uh done with the scripture uh
[53:07] on the uh and then he'll say I want to
[53:10] take the subject this morning uh
[53:13] choosing by faith. So our our our me
[53:19] subject this morning is choosing by
[53:24] faith. God bless you this and you may be
[53:27] seated after he reads the scripture.
[53:28] Thank you.
[53:31] And I thought maybe this morning it
[53:33] would be appropriate to open again this
[53:36] wonderful book being that we have the
[53:38] backgrounds to what we wish to say
[53:42] in the former readings
[53:45] and skipping over the 10th chapter and
[53:48] the ninth chapter which is the
[53:49] sacrificial laws we would come into a
[53:51] spot of faith.
[53:56] And here in the book of
[53:59] Hebrews the 11th chapter and beginning
[54:02] with the 23rd verse we read it like
[54:05] this.
[54:07] By faith Moses when he was born was hid
[54:12] three months of his parents because they
[54:15] saw he was a proper child and they were
[54:19] not afraid of the king's commandment.
[54:23] By faith, Moses,
[54:26] when he came to years, refused to be
[54:30] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
[54:34] choosing
[54:35] rather to suffer the affliction
[54:39] with the people of God
[54:42] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[54:46] season,
[54:48] esteeing the reproach of Christ greater
[54:51] riches.
[54:53] than the treasures of Egypt,
[54:59] and had recompense unto the reward.
[55:02] By faith he forsook Egypt,
[55:06] not fearing the wrath of the king, for
[55:10] he endured as seeing him who is
[55:13] invisibly.
[55:17] I want to take the subject this morning,
[55:20] choosing by faith
[55:23] and I want to take for a text the first
[55:27] three words of the 23rd
[55:31] uh chapter
[55:33] by faith Moses
[55:39] and choosing by faith most everything
[55:42] that we do we have to choose by faith.
[55:47] And all that we find that Moses did
[55:52] that's worth repeating was by faith.
[55:57] Not by sight but by faith.
[56:01] And the reason that I have selected this
[56:04] this morning for the church in this
[56:06] state
[56:08] has been that in our even our schools
[56:11] and around we have had so much of
[56:16] scientific teaching
[56:19] because of this we have drawn the people
[56:22] away from faith.
[56:25] Now faith is not proved by science.
[56:29] Faith is what science doesn't see.
[56:34] And we if we ever lose this great faith
[56:39] then we are totally in darkness.
[56:45] It no matter how well we are educated
[56:49] how we could explain the word of God to
[56:52] suit our own way of believing.
[56:56] There is no way to ever please God only
[57:00] by faith.
[57:03] The scripture plainly states it that
[57:05] way.
[57:08] And it's by faith and without faith,
[57:12] says the scripture, it is impossible to
[57:17] please God.
[57:19] So if faith disagrees with science and
[57:24] science disagrees with faith that puts
[57:28] them at at edge in each other then we
[57:32] must take a choice as Moses did
[57:36] by faith we believe.
[57:40] Now if we lose faith then we will never
[57:45] get a prayer answered by God.
[57:49] For he that cometh to God must first
[57:52] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[57:56] those that diligently seek after him.
[58:00] So if we lose faith, our prayers are
[58:04] analled. We get nowhere.
[58:09] So it's all
[58:11] that we can think of this morning is to
[58:14] hold on to faith.
[58:18] Then if we lose faith all our hopes is
[58:21] gone.
[58:24] And if we lose faith all our
[58:28] spiritual reality is gone.
[58:31] For you cannot have faith in things that
[58:35] you see.
[58:37] For the things that you see are all
[58:40] perishable.
[58:43] If we look at some great person,
[58:48] a great minister or a great
[58:50] congregation,
[58:53] they will all perish someday.
[58:57] And if we look at a great nation or a
[59:00] great weapon,
[59:02] they'll all perish someday.
[59:06] And then we must live by faith of those
[59:11] things that science does not declare.
[59:15] It's by faith that we believe.
[59:19] Now we lose our glory
[59:23] if we lose faith.
[59:26] Now if we get away from faith then we
[59:29] take the church into an intellectual
[59:31] realm.
[59:34] And many times it's been thought amongst
[59:37] people that because a congregation was
[59:42] large
[59:44] and they had great
[59:48] churches,
[59:49] great people
[59:52] and a great lot of welldressed and
[59:55] groomed peoples
[59:57] and a lot of uh finances that they could
[1:00:00] afford such things.
[1:00:03] We've many times thought that was
[1:00:06] inspiring,
[1:00:08] that this certain church must be
[1:00:10] inspired.
[1:00:13] Or we've often referred to different
[1:00:15] ministers who get out on the field and
[1:00:18] have great gatherings of crowds
[1:00:23] and we think sometimes that they are the
[1:00:26] signs of inspiration,
[1:00:29] but that's not altogether the truth.
[1:00:33] That's human inspiration.
[1:00:36] But the real inspiration comes by doing
[1:00:40] the will of God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; See, whether it is a one or just a
[1:00:46] handful, whether it is a big church or a
[1:00:50] small church, it matters not.
[1:00:54] Whether he is a great eloquent speaker
[1:00:57] or just a man that hardly knows his
[1:01:00] ABCs. It doesn't matter.
[1:01:03] It depends on the message that he's
[1:01:05] bringing
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; whether it is inspired by the word of
[1:01:10] God or is it inspired by intellectual
[1:01:14] conceptions of human inspiration.
[1:01:18] Some people can be inspired because of
[1:01:20] an eloquent speaker.
[1:01:23] That doesn't make it right. Sometimes
[1:01:25] they're inspired because the man is so
[1:01:27] trained that he can put his point over
[1:01:30] it. That doesn't mean that it's of God.
[1:01:33] See, it's only through God's everlasting
[1:01:38] eternal blessed word can we receive
[1:01:41] inspiration and that's given by the Holy
[1:01:44] Ghost.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; By faith we receive it.
[1:01:49] Now we would think of Moses
[1:01:52] and this great time of
[1:01:56] his life and we read back of his birth
[1:02:00] and how that God had cared for him.
[1:02:04] But there come a time in Moses life to
[1:02:08] where there had to be a choosing time.
[1:02:13] If we read right, we find out that he
[1:02:16] was the son of Pharaoh's daughter and
[1:02:19] was the heir to the throne
[1:02:23] and would have been the next Pharaoh in
[1:02:25] Egypt.
[1:02:27] So he would notice as he looked around
[1:02:32] after he had become of age and other
[1:02:35] accountability
[1:02:37] and there would be those slaves working
[1:02:41] out in the slime pits.
[1:02:45] And Moses as he looked through the
[1:02:48] windows of the palace
[1:02:51] upon the same slaves that Pharaoh looked
[1:02:55] on. [clears throat]
[1:02:58] But what a difference there was in the
[1:03:01] looking.
[1:03:04] I want to base that thought this morning
[1:03:07] for a few minutes and may the God of
[1:03:11] heaven drive it home to every heart
[1:03:13] here.
[1:03:16] It's how you look at anything what makes
[1:03:19] the difference.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; The great evangelist John Sproul which
[1:03:26] was a convert of brother Bosworth's
[1:03:28] ministry
[1:03:30] who many of you remember years ago of
[1:03:32] the old glory barn. He said one day he
[1:03:36] was taking a trip before the deceasing
[1:03:38] of his beloved companion and wife.
[1:03:43] They were in Las Salarine's France
[1:03:47] and I had the privilege of visiting the
[1:03:50] same place and the guide was taking them
[1:03:53] out through the gardens and showing them
[1:03:56] the different things and they come upon
[1:03:59] a certain statue of the Lord Jesus the
[1:04:03] crucifixion
[1:04:05] and Mr. brother was standing off looking
[1:04:07] at it. He and his wife and in their
[1:04:10] hearts were criticizing
[1:04:13] what the artists must have had in mind
[1:04:15] or the sculpture rather when he heed out
[1:04:19] of a stone such a horrible looking thing
[1:04:23] to be to represent the suffering and the
[1:04:26] love
[1:04:28] and the pity of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:32] and how it was all crudely and chopped
[1:04:36] up looking and the guide came to Mr.
[1:04:40] Sproul and he said, "Sir, I suppose that
[1:04:44] you are criticizing this statue of the
[1:04:48] Lord Jesus."
[1:04:51] And he said, "I am."
[1:04:54] And he said, "I'm not a bit surprised
[1:04:57] because most people that look at it
[1:04:59] first, they do criticize it."
[1:05:03] And Mr. scroll said, "Well, I can't see
[1:05:06] any pity or any inspiration from looking
[1:05:11] at such a thing. So, I'm wondering why
[1:05:15] the sculpture every made it like this."
[1:05:20] And the sculpture said, "Mr. Skull,
[1:05:25] the statue's all right."
[1:05:29] and the sculpture had the right thing in
[1:05:32] his mind,
[1:05:35] but where the trouble is is with you.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's the way you're looking at it."
[1:05:44] And he took he and his wife by the hand
[1:05:47] and led them down to a a altar at the
[1:05:50] foot of the said cross.
[1:05:54] And he said, "Now, Mr. Spr look up now.
[1:05:58] And when he looked up, he said his heart
[1:06:01] like to have failed him.
[1:06:05] What a difference it was to stand off
[1:06:07] there and look at it that way and to get
[1:06:10] down and look at it the way that it was
[1:06:13] made to look at.
[1:06:16] And that's the way that God is.
[1:06:20] That's the way that faith is. It's the
[1:06:24] way you look at it. If you look at it as
[1:06:29] some sort of a historical Bible
[1:06:33] of something that was in the days gone
[1:06:36] by,
[1:06:38] you will never be able to get the real
[1:06:42] value of the Bible.
[1:06:45] You are supposed to get on your knees
[1:06:50] and oy the commandments of this Bible
[1:06:54] and look at it through the eyes of the
[1:06:56] Holy Spirit.
[1:06:59] I would ask this audience this morning.
[1:07:02] What good does a historical God do us
[1:07:06] today if he isn't the same God?
[1:07:10] What good does a God that would take
[1:07:14] Moses and do the miracles with him that
[1:07:18] he did? What good would it do us to read
[1:07:21] of such a God if he isn't the same one
[1:07:24] today?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; What good is a God that could deliver
[1:07:29] from the fiery furnace the Hebrew
[1:07:32] children if he isn't the same God today?
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; What God is the God that would judge
[1:07:40] between right and wrong in a day gone by
[1:07:43] and punish the wrong and bless the
[1:07:46] right? If he isn't the same God today,
[1:07:49] what do we go to church for?
[1:07:53] Why do we abstain from things of the
[1:07:56] world if he isn't the same God of the
[1:07:58] same judgment and the same opinion that
[1:08:01] he always was?
[1:08:04] What good would it be for a God who
[1:08:07] could touch a woman's hand with a raging
[1:08:10] fever
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; and the fever stopped?
[1:08:15] If he isn't the same God today,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; what good would it be to serve a God who
[1:08:22] could call his friend from a grave after
[1:08:25] being dead four days if he isn't the
[1:08:28] same God today?
[1:08:32] By faith we believe that some glorious
[1:08:36] day he shall call us from the earth.
[1:08:38] Though we be a spoonful of ashes again.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; How do we prove it? We do not prove it.
[1:08:46] We believe it.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; We're not asked to prove anything. We're
[1:08:51] asked to believe it.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; By faith. Moses did such and such.
[1:08:59] And as Moses as a young man looked
[1:09:02] through the palace window
[1:09:05] at the slaves,
[1:09:07] he saw the same bunch of grimy, dirty,
[1:09:12] muckridden slaves that Pharaoh saw.
[1:09:18] And when Pharaoh looked upon him and the
[1:09:21] Egyptians, they wasn't nothing but a
[1:09:23] bunch of slaves.
[1:09:26] That's all they were good for, just to
[1:09:28] be human mudbers
[1:09:31] to make muddy bricks for the benefit of
[1:09:36] the cities that Pharaoh was building.
[1:09:40] That's the way mo the Egyptians and
[1:09:43] Pharaoh looked at the slaves.
[1:09:48] But Moses
[1:09:51] when he looked at him,
[1:09:54] it was a different look Moses had
[1:09:58] when he seen passing by [laughter] the
[1:10:00] window.
[1:10:02] [clears throat]
[1:10:03] The great ditches in their face,
[1:10:07] the tears that run down their cheeks and
[1:10:11] their bent bodies.
[1:10:14] Oh God.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He looked upon them as the people of
[1:10:18] God.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't look upon them as slaves.
[1:10:26] He looked upon them as the chosen people
[1:10:30] of God.
[1:10:32] Oh, as I go about from country to
[1:10:36] country and from nation to nation
[1:10:40] preaching
[1:10:43] since I left the doors of this little
[1:10:45] tabernacle that's an interdenominational
[1:10:48] institution
[1:10:50] with no law but love, [screaming] no
[1:10:53] book but the Bible, no creed but Christ.
[1:10:57] I've tried to look upon God's children
[1:11:01] and upon the rejected
[1:11:04] as being God's chosen and elected
[1:11:08] people. I don't ask them if they belong
[1:11:11] to the Brandon Tabernacle.
[1:11:13] I don't ask them if they're Methodists
[1:11:15] or if they are Presbyterians
[1:11:18] or if they are Pentecostals
[1:11:22] or Nazarines are pilgrim holiness.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I just want to look upon them as the
[1:11:29] people of God.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing their doings and their
[1:11:34] actions that they are the servants of
[1:11:38] the Lord God and my heart desires
[1:11:41] fellowship with them.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; No matter what brand they got, I just
[1:11:48] long for their fellowship.
[1:11:52] I love them because I know they are
[1:11:55] people of God.
[1:11:58] When I see a woman coming down the
[1:12:01] street
[1:12:02] with a long skirt and her hair done up
[1:12:06] neatly in the back and and a decent
[1:12:09] looking dress on
[1:12:11] and I see another young lady, maybe the
[1:12:15] same age with a little pair of shorts
[1:12:18] on.
[1:12:19] She may be in looks twice as pity as the
[1:12:23] woman with the long hair according to
[1:12:25] the looking of the world, but I
[1:12:27] [screaming] take my side with that girl
[1:12:31] that's dressed like a Christian.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Though they'd be laughing at her and
[1:12:38] calling her a fanatic, yet I take my
[1:12:42] side.
[1:12:43] She might not be as pretty as the other
[1:12:45] girl featurely, but she sees something
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; by faith. She sees him who is invisible,
[1:12:53] who is guiding her life. Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; When I see the man on the job being
[1:13:00] called deacon
[1:13:02] or preacher
[1:13:05] or a fanatic
[1:13:07] because he refuses to smoke and to drink
[1:13:10] beer
[1:13:12] and to go to dances like the rest of
[1:13:15] them and he's called a fanatic.
[1:13:18] My heart goes out for him.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He is my brother.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:25] down in this Egypt soils.
[1:13:29] That makes our heart long to embrace him
[1:13:34] and say, "Brother, we are pilgrims and
[1:13:38] strangers of this land, and I long to
[1:13:41] fellowship with you."
[1:13:45] Moses had to make a choice,
[1:13:49] choosing by faith.
[1:13:52] How many young men would have jumped at
[1:13:55] the opportunity to become the son of
[1:13:59] Pharaoh's daughter?
[1:14:02] How many young men would have jumped at
[1:14:04] the opportunity
[1:14:06] that Moses had to enjoy all the
[1:14:10] pleasures
[1:14:12] and the glamour
[1:14:14] of the world
[1:14:16] to become the king of Egypt
[1:14:20] to have the whole world at his feet.
[1:14:24] What a foolish thing
[1:14:26] that the young man of his days must have
[1:14:29] thought when Moses chose to take his
[1:14:34] place with the afflicted and suffering
[1:14:37] people of God.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Why did he do it?
[1:14:44] By faith.
[1:14:46] When he lifted up his eyes, he looked
[1:14:49] beyond the grammar of this world.
[1:14:54] He looked beyond the pleasures of sin.
[1:14:58] And the Bible said that he endured as
[1:15:01] seeing him who was invisible by faith.
[1:15:04] And he made a choice
[1:15:07] to serve that God regardless
[1:15:11] of what took place.
[1:15:15] It has not changed.
[1:15:18] Many of us could go to what we would
[1:15:20] call a better building.
[1:15:24] We could enjoy maybe the fellowship and
[1:15:27] pleasures
[1:15:28] of sitting in a better pew.
[1:15:33] We might be more popular to drink and to
[1:15:36] smoke and to dress and to act like the
[1:15:40] world. But what's the matter? You've
[1:15:43] lifted up your eyes and by faith you see
[1:15:47] him who is invisible and have took your
[1:15:50] stand with the rejected and so-called
[1:15:53] holy rulers of the day.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; For by faith we see him who is invisible
[1:16:01] choosing to suffer the persecutions and
[1:16:05] the afflictions.
[1:16:07] I wouldn't say to people that they
[1:16:10] should choose to be afflicted.
[1:16:13] I don't say that you should choose
[1:16:15] suffering. It would not be the human
[1:16:17] thing to do. But if suffering lays in
[1:16:21] the path of duty,
[1:16:24] then let's take it as it comes.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to do something for
[1:16:31] somebody to make fun of you.
[1:16:34] I wouldn't want you to say uh uh
[1:16:36] different things that I'm uh I belong to
[1:16:39] a church that doesn't believe in so and
[1:16:41] so in the worlds and things like that
[1:16:43] just to get people to make fun of you.
[1:16:47] You're bringing that on yourself.
[1:16:49] I wouldn't say for you get out here and
[1:16:51] carry on and do something that was
[1:16:54] radical.
[1:16:56] I wouldn't want you to do that so that
[1:16:58] somebody would say that you are a
[1:17:00] fanatic. You bring that on yourself.
[1:17:04] But if it lays in the path of your duty
[1:17:07] towards God, let the world say what they
[1:17:09] want to say.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; You live alone.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; You make a choice.
[1:17:16] Every man and woman has to make this.
[1:17:19] What if Pharaoh could have saw what
[1:17:22] Moses saw?
[1:17:24] He saw the sufferings of the people. He
[1:17:27] knew what the price was to pay. But by
[1:17:30] faith he chose it rather than to have
[1:17:34] the pleasures of sin.
[1:17:37] Is maybe a little young ladies sitting
[1:17:39] here as glamorous young women. The world
[1:17:42] would like to say to you, do thus and
[1:17:45] thus you are beautiful. Your body is so
[1:17:49] pretty shape. You should show that.
[1:17:54] But my sister,
[1:17:56] raise up your eyes and look beyond that
[1:18:01] to him that said it's an abomination for
[1:18:04] a woman to put on a garment that
[1:18:06] pertains to a man.
[1:18:11] [clears throat] If the men of the people
[1:18:13] in your community,
[1:18:16] if the women that you associate with
[1:18:19] said, "Cut that long hair off."
[1:18:22] It would be cooler. [clears throat]
[1:18:25] It would be this that or the other. Or
[1:18:26] it would become you better.
[1:18:29] Don't you listen to that. You lift up
[1:18:33] your eyes and by faith saw him that said
[1:18:36] the woman's hair is her glory and she
[1:18:39] shall not cut it.
[1:18:42] If they say it would be popular, you
[1:18:45] would stand in better with your job or
[1:18:47] with your boss if you take a sociable
[1:18:49] drink. If you would smoke cigarettes
[1:18:52] like the rest of the women, you would
[1:18:54] stand in more sociably in your
[1:18:56] neighborhood
[1:18:58] by faith. Raise your eyes [screaming]
[1:19:01] and look to him who said, "Destpile this
[1:19:03] body and I will destroy it."
[1:19:07] By faith, we believe those things. It's
[1:19:11] nothing that you see. It's something
[1:19:13] [snorts]
[1:19:14] you believe.
[1:19:16] By faith, Moses did.
[1:19:19] And in this faith walk, there comes a
[1:19:22] time there has to be a choice.
[1:19:26] Lot made that sad mistake
[1:19:31] that we make. A lot of times we choose
[1:19:34] for our own good.
[1:19:36] We choose things that would be a better
[1:19:39] sometime if a little squabble comes in
[1:19:41] the church and someone would say, "Well,
[1:19:44] the deacon or the pastors on this side."
[1:19:48] Don't look at that. Look at what's
[1:19:50] righteous.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Get that thing out and bring them both
[1:19:54] together. That's godly.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; There's a choosing and we choose for
[1:20:01] ourselves. We choose something that's
[1:20:04] for our own good. But Moses chose the
[1:20:07] afflictions and the disgrace that he
[1:20:09] might walk with the people of God.
[1:20:13] Think of it now.
[1:20:15] Listen to it. chose the afflictions of
[1:20:19] the people of God and counted it a
[1:20:21] greater treasure for he endured seeing
[1:20:23] him who was invisible.
[1:20:26] Now Lot one time had to make a choice.
[1:20:32] And it may be this morning
[1:20:36] that there will be men and women sitting
[1:20:38] here that'll make your final choice.
[1:20:44] you are today what you are because
[1:20:46] several years ago you chose to be what
[1:20:49] you are now
[1:20:51] and what you choose now will determine
[1:20:53] what you'll be five years from today
[1:20:57] five years today you may be a missionary
[1:20:59] five years today you may be a renowned
[1:21:01] Christian or five years from today you
[1:21:04] may be in hell because you made the
[1:21:06] wrong decision
[1:21:09] five years today you may be cleaning
[1:21:10] spit tunes in a barroom five years today
[1:21:13] you You may be a prostitute on the
[1:21:15] street
[1:21:17] or you may be a man or a woman that's a
[1:21:20] that's a cred to any society because of
[1:21:23] your choice for Christ.
[1:21:27] Five years today you may be in glory
[1:21:29] gone in the rapture
[1:21:31] because you made your choice today but
[1:21:33] you've got to choose and don't look at
[1:21:35] what you see. Choose what you see by
[1:21:38] faith.
[1:21:40] That's the only thing that will count is
[1:21:43] what you choose by faith.
[1:21:47] Lot as he had to make a choice. Abraham
[1:21:50] gave Lot his choice
[1:21:53] and God gives you your choice.
[1:21:57] Choose you this day who you shall serve.
[1:22:00] In the Garden of Eden, there was a tree
[1:22:02] of of knowledge and a tree of life. Man
[1:22:05] was given the privilege to choose either
[1:22:07] one he desired.
[1:22:10] And so is it today you're giving your
[1:22:13] privilege
[1:22:14] as free moral agents to choose whatever
[1:22:17] you want to choose.
[1:22:19] My advice to you is don't look at the
[1:22:22] modern things around you and the
[1:22:24] popularity and the glamour that you
[1:22:26] could be.
[1:22:28] But choose rather [screaming] by faith
[1:22:31] him that give the promise that someday
[1:22:33] he will come
[1:22:36] and will writen all wrongs and will give
[1:22:39] you eternal life and raise you up.
[1:22:42] No matter if you take the despised way
[1:22:44] with the Lord's view, make that choice.
[1:22:49] If there's troubles in the hand, if
[1:22:51] there's troubles in the land, if there's
[1:22:52] troubles in the church, if there's
[1:22:54] troubles in the home,
[1:22:56] no matter where it is, make your
[1:22:59] [screaming] choice by faith. I'll serve
[1:23:02] God.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; I'll humble my heart in his presence.
[1:23:06] I'll take the way with God's children.
[1:23:09] I'll see them despised and rejected and
[1:23:12] drove out and made fun of, but I'll
[1:23:14] still take my post of duty.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll stay right by them. And when
[1:23:19] they cry, I'll cry with them.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And when there's sorrow, I shall sorrow
[1:23:25] with them.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; The way they live, I'll live. Like Noma
[1:23:30] said, Arus said to Noma,
[1:23:34] "Your ways be my ways, my ways be your
[1:23:37] ways. Where you live, I'll live. Where
[1:23:40] you go, I'll go." The God that you serve
[1:23:43] will be my God.
[1:23:45] Take that choice.
[1:23:47] though it pulls the very skin off of
[1:23:49] your conscience
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; of thinking that you're somebody.
[1:23:54] Skin yourself down and take your away
[1:23:56] with the Lord's despised few.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; And stay loyal on the field of service
[1:24:04] and at the post of duty.
[1:24:21] That's pretty good.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; I hope you were
[1:24:27] able to stay concentrated for those 30
[1:24:32] minutes. You know, that was a choice
[1:24:35] of whether you'd listen or whether you
[1:24:38] daydream off. But there there's there
[1:24:41] are so many
[1:24:43] uh great things that uh were uh spoken
[1:24:50] there, you know, by faith. It's it's
[1:24:53] it's a a a choice. And and if we just
[1:24:58] skim back through it, uh we we would see
[1:25:01] that that uh you know it if you have
[1:25:06] your Bibles where you're sitting and you
[1:25:08] would turn to Hebrews
[1:25:10] uh the 4th chapter and the second verse
[1:25:14] um and uh to bring some importance uh
[1:25:21] and reence to it
[1:25:25] to where that we uh here it says
[1:25:35] in the Hebrews the 4th chapter it says
[1:25:38] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[1:25:42] being left us
[1:25:45] of entertaining unto his entering into
[1:25:49] his rest and ye should seem to come
[1:25:53] short of it. So he says let let us fear
[1:25:56] therefore you know that a promise that's
[1:26:00] being made to us that we
[1:26:05] fall short of it. So think of all the
[1:26:08] promises that have been given to us in
[1:26:11] the scripture
[1:26:13] and we fall short of those promises.
[1:26:17] Now, Paul's going to give us the reason
[1:26:20] why it is that we fall short of the
[1:26:25] promises that we fall short. And uh and
[1:26:30] then he goes on to say, he says, "For
[1:26:32] unto us was the gospel preached
[1:26:38] as well as unto them."
[1:26:41] So this morning, the gospel was preached
[1:26:43] to everybody in here.
[1:26:47] It's what he said. But
[1:26:50] the word preached did not profit them.
[1:26:56] In other words, it had no effect. It had
[1:26:59] no influence. It didn't do them any
[1:27:02] good. They heard it.
[1:27:05] They heard it just like you heard it.
[1:27:08] And they fell short of what was promised
[1:27:11] in the word to them.
[1:27:14] They they didn't obtain
[1:27:17] the promise. They fell short of it be
[1:27:22] be. He said they fell short of it. It it
[1:27:25] didn't profit them not being mixed with
[1:27:28] faith in them that heard it. Not being
[1:27:34] mixed
[1:27:35] with faith.
[1:27:37] And and we we see that uh so often. And
[1:27:42] we we we as we heard this morning that
[1:27:46] faith is a choice.
[1:27:49] And so we see it so often. We see people
[1:27:52] come pray for things and they they pray
[1:27:55] for things over and over and over again
[1:27:59] or they'll come to the altar and you
[1:28:02] know sometimes people they they say I
[1:28:05] hear it all the time you know that I I
[1:28:07] don't believe in in shouting and I don't
[1:28:10] believe in the movement of the Holy
[1:28:12] Spirit and I don't believe in the
[1:28:14] anointing
[1:28:16] and that's okay. I'm willing to bear
[1:28:19] that approach. But I know one thing, you
[1:28:23] know, like Paul said, I I've laid my
[1:28:25] hands on the sick and seen them recover.
[1:28:29] You know, I I've seen people that had
[1:28:32] demons and I've seen demons cast out,
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; you know, and and those things aren't by
[1:28:39] anointing, they're by faith. Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And it's by faith that it's impossible
[1:28:46] to please God without faith and not be
[1:28:50] mixed with faith. And so that's what our
[1:28:53] hearts desire this morning is that we
[1:28:56] could come to the spot that we could
[1:28:58] start mixing the word of God. They hear
[1:29:02] the word of God. The word of God's
[1:29:04] preached to them and it has effect on
[1:29:08] them. Many times it brings them to the
[1:29:11] altar.
[1:29:13] And we just heard our messenger say,
[1:29:15] "Some people are inspired
[1:29:17] by by great
[1:29:20] ministries or they're inspired because
[1:29:23] somebody can put their point across. You
[1:29:28] just they just got the ability to put
[1:29:30] their point across."
[1:29:32] And and and that that's the inspiration.
[1:29:37] And maybe they come to the altar under
[1:29:39] that inspiration
[1:29:41] and under that anointing, but they leave
[1:29:46] without it profiting them anything.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Now, as a pastor, that's what breaks my
[1:29:53] heart.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Because they it wasn't mixed with faith.
[1:30:02] They they they they came to repent but
[1:30:06] not to receive.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; They came to acknowledge
[1:30:14] but not be delivered.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; You could preach a sermon that puts
[1:30:21] everybody in here under condemnation.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Because the more I make you look at
[1:30:27] yourself, the more you'll feel unworthy.
[1:30:30] The more I bring up circumstances, the
[1:30:33] more you'll realize your failures.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And pretty soon you feel, well, I'm
[1:30:43] unworthy. I've sinned. I'm a failure.
[1:30:47] And then you come to the altar and you
[1:30:49] and you weep and you cry.
[1:30:52] I'm a failure.
[1:30:56] How many times have I prayed for people
[1:30:58] at the altar and they f get to the
[1:31:00] bottom of the matter and the only reason
[1:31:03] they're there is because they believe
[1:31:05] the accusation that Satan accused them
[1:31:08] of
[1:31:14] is that not what he told us?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Let me just read it to you.
[1:31:26] He says,
[1:31:29] he said,
[1:31:31] "And choose by faith." Most everything
[1:31:34] we do,
[1:31:37] we have to choose by faith.
[1:31:40] And all that we find as Moses did that's
[1:31:44] worth repeating was by faith. Not by
[1:31:47] sight, but by faith. Sometimes we put
[1:31:51] faith in the accusation.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; We believe
[1:31:57] what he said.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And it's good to be convicted.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit's job is, is
[1:32:05] to convict you of sin.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; But it isn't to leave you a sinner.
[1:32:15] It isn't to just prove that that you you
[1:32:20] don't have the spirit. Sometimes we
[1:32:22] spend so much time trying to prove to
[1:32:25] people you don't have the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:27] You don't have the Holy Spirit. You're
[1:32:29] not born again. You know, when you got
[1:32:31] the Holy Spirit in the thinking of God
[1:32:34] before there ever was a [screaming]
[1:32:36] world.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] If you had eternal life, you always have
[1:32:45] eternal life. There is only one spirit
[1:32:48] and that's the Holy Spirit. Don't mix up
[1:32:51] anointing with the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit amens every word of God.
[1:32:59] The Holy Spirit mixes faith.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit does.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; gives you faith.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; I've seen him sit there and and and it
[1:33:18] and just because Satan told them
[1:33:23] something and they believed it.
[1:33:27] Why?
[1:33:29] He's the accuser of the brethren.
[1:33:33] He's got your history book.
[1:33:37] Have you ever thought of something you
[1:33:39] did maybe 20 years ago? Something you
[1:33:42] said and all of a sudden you get all
[1:33:45] embarrassed.
[1:33:47] You feel embarrassed.
[1:33:49] I can't believe I did that. I can't
[1:33:51] believe I said that. And you actually
[1:33:54] feel embarrassed.
[1:33:56] And it's history.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; It's the past.
[1:34:02] So it's got to be mixed with faith.
[1:34:06] And I said it last week, I'll say it
[1:34:08] again. If you've repented of your sins
[1:34:14] and you've been baptized in the name of
[1:34:16] the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive
[1:34:19] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Now, if you mix that with faith,
[1:34:29] [snorts]
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; right? What was the faith of Abraham?
[1:34:33] He who made the promise was able to keep
[1:34:36] the promise.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; If if I say that I I' I've repented of
[1:34:41] my sins, I've been baptized in the name
[1:34:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall
[1:34:46] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. You
[1:34:48] can approach it two ways.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; You can come to the altar every service
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; and you can cry and beg for the Holy
[1:34:59] Spirit and you will get it.
[1:35:03] Or you can sit in your seat
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; and say, "Praise God. I'm promised the
[1:35:09] Holy Spirit and you will get it.
[1:35:22] The way of faith
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; is faster
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; because someday it's got to be mixed
[1:35:32] with faith
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; in order to profit it. You got to
[1:35:36] believe that it's for you. You got to
[1:35:38] believe it's yours. You got to believe
[1:35:40] it's a promise.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And the God who made the promise. I like
[1:35:45] what the prophet of God said. He said,
[1:35:47] "God isn't an Indian giver. He doesn't
[1:35:50] give a promise and then take it away.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; The only requirement you have to have
[1:35:59] for that promise to become a reality to
[1:36:01] you is mix it with faith and then it
[1:36:06] becomes profitable.
[1:36:11] But he always tries to rob us
[1:36:16] again. Just listen to some of the
[1:36:18] wonderful things he said
[1:36:22] and and why faith is so important.
[1:36:25] He said he said this is a reason I've
[1:36:28] selected this this morning for the
[1:36:31] church in this state.
[1:36:34] And you know that doesn't mean the state
[1:36:35] of Indiana
[1:36:37] in its condition.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; The reason the Holy Spirit has brought
[1:36:43] us this message this morning is because
[1:36:46] of our condition.
[1:36:50] In other words, we're hearing the word
[1:36:53] of God.
[1:36:56] intellectually conception. We accept it
[1:37:00] as truth,
[1:37:02] but we're not mixing it with faith
[1:37:07] that it becomes a reality and a
[1:37:11] possession because faith is an evidence
[1:37:14] of possession. You know, you got it.
[1:37:20] It's something that is so real to you.
[1:37:24] But remember what he said, faith is the
[1:37:27] way that you look at it.
[1:37:31] [snorts]
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Faith is the choice
[1:37:36] of how that you choose
[1:37:39] to look at the circumstance,
[1:37:42] how you try to look at your history, how
[1:37:46] you choose to look at your past, how you
[1:37:49] choose to look at the present. If it's
[1:37:52] how that you choose
[1:37:56] to draw the picture
[1:37:59] to perceive the environment,
[1:38:03] how that you choose to to accept
[1:38:08] what's going on either by accusation or
[1:38:11] by God's word.
[1:38:14] Faith is how that you look at it.
[1:38:17] That's what he said. He said now why is
[1:38:19] it so important that we don't lose
[1:38:21] faith?
[1:38:23] He says because it's a condition. It
[1:38:26] says we have so much scientific
[1:38:30] teaching,
[1:38:33] so much education, so much technology,
[1:38:36] so much psychology,
[1:38:39] so much philosophy,
[1:38:41] [snorts] so much influence in rock and
[1:38:44] roll music and in political
[1:38:48] divide and in intellectual conceptions
[1:38:53] being tossed to our minds.
[1:38:57] That's all under science,
[1:39:00] education, and civilization.
[1:39:04] All of it's designed
[1:39:06] to destroy our faith.
[1:39:10] Because of this, we have drawn the
[1:39:13] people away from faith.
[1:39:18] Everything's working to draw us away
[1:39:21] from faith.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Because faith,
[1:39:25] when a promise is mixed with faith,
[1:39:29] then it's profitable.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; You can accept the promise.
[1:39:36] You can believe in the promise giver.
[1:39:40] You can believe the promise is true, but
[1:39:43] it'll never come to you till you mix it
[1:39:45] with faith. Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Just like forgiveness,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; he said he forgive you of your sin.
[1:39:55] You've got to accept it.
[1:39:58] You've got to mix that with faith.
[1:40:05] Just like the scripture says,
[1:40:08] it says in Isaiah 53 and five, I believe
[1:40:12] it is. Uh yeah.
[1:40:16] the chastisement of his peace
[1:40:19] was upon us.
[1:40:22] In other words, the scripture says that
[1:40:24] he took the punishment for our sin.
[1:40:32] How many times do we go through this
[1:40:37] where we do something or something bad
[1:40:40] comes upon us or things don't go the way
[1:40:44] that we thought they should go or the
[1:40:48] what we've been longing for h has taken
[1:40:51] a while to arrive
[1:40:54] and all of a sudden we start looking at
[1:40:57] ourselves and saying it's because I did
[1:41:00] this, it's because I did that, it's
[1:41:04] because of this, and it's because of
[1:41:06] that. And we go all back through our
[1:41:09] history,
[1:41:10] and now we think that we're paying the
[1:41:13] price
[1:41:14] for the things we do. And then maybe
[1:41:16] even the scripture will rise up in our
[1:41:19] mind. Well, you're reaping what you
[1:41:21] sowed. And and now you're in this big
[1:41:24] negative spiral.
[1:41:28] Well, if you want to look at it that
[1:41:30] way,
[1:41:32] that's the way it'll be.
[1:41:36] If that's what you're going to believe,
[1:41:40] then now your faith in that
[1:41:44] now makes you accept that as a reality.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Or you could look at it through the word
[1:41:52] of God.
[1:41:54] I do deserve this.
[1:41:57] But
[1:41:59] he took the punishment
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; for my past.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; There's no way this can be a punishment
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; because he already bore the punishment
[1:42:11] by his stripes.
[1:42:14] There's no way this is God
[1:42:18] punishing me
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; for the things I've done
[1:42:24] cuz he paid for that punishment. Now if
[1:42:27] you mix that with faith
[1:42:31] and you believe that all of a sudden you
[1:42:34] can start turning to the circumstances
[1:42:36] and seeing those circumstances in
[1:42:39] different light.
[1:42:41] Then you can say, "Satan,
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; get behind me.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; It is written,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; he bore my sufferings.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, I am healed." Now, it
[1:42:54] profits you something.
[1:42:58] Cuz it's mixed with faith.
[1:43:02] It becomes something that does something
[1:43:04] for you.
[1:43:08] He said, "My burden was light.
[1:43:13] and we carry a load. And yet we find out
[1:43:16] that he said he'd carry our burden. Cast
[1:43:20] your cares
[1:43:22] upon him for he carth
[1:43:26] for you.
[1:43:29] Now that's a nice saying, isn't it?
[1:43:32] But if you don't mix it with faith,
[1:43:38] faith changes the way you look at it.
[1:43:47] It changes the way that you see it.
[1:43:55] All of a sudden, it could be a burden.
[1:43:57] [snorts] Maybe your finances are
[1:43:59] pressing you. But by faith, he said, "I
[1:44:02] shall not see the righteous bake bread."
[1:44:05] [snorts] By faith, you can say, "Lord,
[1:44:07] I'm going through a hard time, but
[1:44:09] you're the Lord thy God that deliverth
[1:44:11] me out of all my troubles."
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; By faith,
[1:44:16] it changes it. Until it's mixed with
[1:44:20] faith,
[1:44:21] you can't go forward.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he said. How how
[1:44:27] important I I I wish I could drive this
[1:44:29] down. I wish I had the ministry like we
[1:44:32] just heard to make it so real to you.
[1:44:37] There's only two powers, doubt and
[1:44:39] faith.
[1:44:41] Faith is associated with love.
[1:44:50] He says here he says
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; he says if we ever lose the great faith
[1:44:59] then we are totally in darkness.
[1:45:05] If you ever lose faith you become
[1:45:09] totally in darkness.
[1:45:11] You will let the darkness of Satan's
[1:45:14] lies. You let the darkness of this earth
[1:45:17] now determine how that you're looking at
[1:45:20] things. You can look at this world as
[1:45:22] being a terrible place. Or you can look
[1:45:24] at it and say, "Some glad morning
[1:45:28] when the battle's over, I'll fly away.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; This is not my home. I'm just so
[1:45:35] journeying through here. By faith, he's
[1:45:37] coming to get me. I will not go through
[1:45:40] the tribulation." by the word of God.
[1:45:42] You start viewing things through the
[1:45:45] eyes of God's word and you believe that
[1:45:48] what God said is true. It changes
[1:45:51] things.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; The burden isn't so heavy.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; You begin to say, "Oh,
[1:46:02] the trying of my faith for a season."
[1:46:06] Rejoice
[1:46:07] at the trying of your faith.
[1:46:10] The fiery darts of the enemy are more
[1:46:13] precious in gold than silver.
[1:46:16] Why wouldn't that be? Some of the
[1:46:18] devil's just
[1:46:20] thinging arrows and you're getting,
[1:46:23] you know, and I mean, you're about just
[1:46:25] to cave in and Satan says, "I've got
[1:46:28] you. I'm bringing you down." And you
[1:46:30] say, "Oh, I I believe it."
[1:46:36] And then you're in depression.
[1:46:38] You know what I mean? You think you're a
[1:46:40] failure. [snorts] You think it's not
[1:46:43] going to get better. Pretty soon, you've
[1:46:45] got the wrong job. You married the wrong
[1:46:48] guy. You didn't want these kids
[1:46:50] anywhere. You know what I mean? You hate
[1:46:53] Texas. You you you hate you hate this
[1:46:57] place. And and you know, and
[1:47:01] well, I'm just going to go eat worms.
[1:47:06] Nobody loves me. Everybody hates me.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You want to believe that?
[1:47:16] Is that how you want to look at it?
[1:47:21] But God gives you another way to look at
[1:47:23] it.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Think it not strange.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Of the trying of your faith.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because faith is going to make me
[1:47:32] stronger.
[1:47:36] Faith is going to give me a victory.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Satan, you've got nothing on me. You
[1:47:42] can't do anything to me. My name's
[1:47:44] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:47:46] before the foundation of the world.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lose my house. I'm not
[1:47:52] going to lose my job. I'm not going to
[1:47:53] lose my marriage. You're a liar.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; You're an accuser.
[1:47:59] You're trying to paint a picture for me
[1:48:02] to look at. You're trying to give me
[1:48:06] something to put my faith in. And if you
[1:48:10] lose faith in God's word, you are now in
[1:48:14] total darkness. If you lose this great
[1:48:17] faith,
[1:48:20] do you hear what he's saying? If we lose
[1:48:23] this great faith in God's word, not did
[1:48:27] you feel it? Do you believe it?
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; If you lose this faith, it doesn't
[1:48:35] matter what you know about the word. He
[1:48:37] actually read it. You can read this
[1:48:39] Bible and be under the intellectual
[1:48:43] of man's intellectual inspiration.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make it right.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; But when your faith
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; anchors in God's word,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; it changes the way you look at it.
[1:49:01] Faith
[1:49:03] is the way you look at it.
[1:49:11] You can go to the doctor.
[1:49:14] The doctor going to say you're not
[1:49:15] getting well.
[1:49:17] Maybe you want a child and the doctor
[1:49:19] says you can't have a child.
[1:49:22] You can walk out and believe him.
[1:49:27] All the evidence is there.
[1:49:32] Or you can look at another guy who
[1:49:33] wanted a child,
[1:49:35] was promised a child. He's 80 years old.
[1:49:39] No, I'm 76 and I don't want a baby
[1:49:42] running around in my house.
[1:49:50] You know, little James comes running up
[1:49:52] to me. You know what I mean? He wants me
[1:49:55] to pick him up. I bend over to pick him
[1:49:57] up.
[1:49:59] My goodness gracious
[1:50:02] and he gets on you and you,
[1:50:05] you [snorts] know, drooling on you and
[1:50:07] Well, that's you might that's great for
[1:50:09] you cuz but when you get old you'd like
[1:50:12] a little peace and quiet, you know, I'm
[1:50:15] going to tell on you, brother Adrien.
[1:50:19] So Adrien had 50 people over for
[1:50:21] Thanksgiving.
[1:50:23] So he dropped by to give me a crescent
[1:50:26] roll
[1:50:27] and some other things I'm not supposed
[1:50:29] to have.
[1:50:32] And he sat in my house. He went,
[1:50:35] "It's so peaceful."
[1:50:39] I says, "Adrigent, when you get my age,
[1:50:41] it has to be that way."
[1:50:47] But Abraham believed God.
[1:50:52] He didn't look at it that way.
[1:50:55] He didn't look at the deadness of him or
[1:50:58] Sarah's wound, did he?
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; It was how he looked at it.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; It's how he chose
[1:51:06] to look at it.
[1:51:08] Choosing faith
[1:51:10] was how he chose to look at it.
[1:51:14] If he had the promise, he knew that God
[1:51:17] was able to perform the promise and he
[1:51:20] knew that God was able to put any
[1:51:22] changes that he needed in his life
[1:51:26] in order for the promise to come to
[1:51:28] pass.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; He looked at it totally different. He
[1:51:32] changed the way he looked at it. He
[1:51:34] looked at it through the eyes of faith.
[1:51:37] He didn't look at the impossibility.
[1:51:43] He didn't look at the negativity.
[1:51:47] [snorts] He didn't look at himself.
[1:51:51] The promise didn't come from him.
[1:51:56] He didn't make the promise. God made the
[1:51:58] promise. And he knew if God made the
[1:52:01] promise, then God was obligated to keep
[1:52:04] his word.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; It was by faith.
[1:52:10] And that's why the battle's always in
[1:52:12] your mind. The accuser is always in your
[1:52:14] mind. He never wants you to believe it's
[1:52:18] for you.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; He never wants you to get to look at it
[1:52:26] that this is my promise.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; It's a promise.
[1:52:33] I believe God made this promise. That's
[1:52:36] a promise.
[1:52:37] I believe God is able to keep his
[1:52:40] promises.
[1:52:44] Wrong way.
[1:52:47] That's not faith. That's religion.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; That's creed. That's dogma. That's Bible
[1:52:56] teaching. I believe Bible teaching. I
[1:53:00] believe everything the Bible says. But
[1:53:03] I'll tell you, when you say every
[1:53:05] promise in the book is mine, every
[1:53:08] chapter, every verse, every line, now
[1:53:12] you've changed the way you're looking at
[1:53:14] it. That's faith.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; And if you take that promise and mix
[1:53:19] that promise with faith, now it becomes
[1:53:22] profitable.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We've got a message
[1:53:28] that we all know is true,
[1:53:32] vindicated,
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; but it's not becoming profitable
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; because we're not mixing it
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; with faith.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; We've accepted the fact that it's true.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; We've accepted the fact that brother
[1:53:55] Brandham was a prophet.
[1:54:01] That's true. [cough]
[1:54:04] He was a prophet. [clears throat]
[1:54:06] Many people believe brother, [laughter]
[1:54:08] excuse me, [cough]
[1:54:10] believe Brother was a prophet, but God
[1:54:12] took him home because of his doctrine.
[1:54:17] You want to look at it that way? Fine.
[1:54:20] The message doesn't do them one bit of
[1:54:22] good.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:25] But when you believe it's your message,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; then then you start hearing things and
[1:54:31] it start changing things.
[1:54:37] But if you mix it with faith,
[1:54:41] so there's a difference
[1:54:44] between believing something's true,
[1:54:47] believing that it's right, believing
[1:54:49] this is the right way, and then and and
[1:54:53] taking it and hearing what you hear
[1:54:58] and looking at it through the eyes of
[1:55:03] God's word and changing the way you see
[1:55:07] things.
[1:55:10] Faith is not the acknowledgment.
[1:55:15] Paul summed it up this way. Satan
[1:55:17] believes
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; and fears and trembles.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He knows it's true.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; But here, this is why the faith's
[1:55:26] important to us because without it,
[1:55:28] we're in total darkness.
[1:55:31] He says, "So if faith disagrees with
[1:55:34] science and science disagrees with
[1:55:36] faith, that puts them at edge at each
[1:55:40] other."
[1:55:42] In other words, at edge means they're in
[1:55:44] battle.
[1:55:46] They're trying to cut one another.
[1:55:51] Satan's trying to cut your faith.
[1:55:54] He's trying to keep you from mixing it,
[1:55:56] saying, "This is mine.
[1:55:59] This applies to me. Like I said about
[1:56:02] Abraham, you could listen to that doctor
[1:56:07] or you could walk out in faith and
[1:56:10] saying, "Lord, my family wants to have a
[1:56:12] child.
[1:56:14] I believe what your word says that my
[1:56:16] quiver will be filled. I I believe that
[1:56:19] that every promise in this book's mine.
[1:56:22] I believe that you can do the
[1:56:23] impossible. I believe that you're a
[1:56:26] creator
[1:56:27] and you can start changing the whole way
[1:56:29] you look at it,
[1:56:32] the whole way you're perceiving it. Now
[1:56:35] you're walking by faith.
[1:56:38] He said, "If I was in prison
[1:56:42] and I was to be executed in the morning,
[1:56:46] I'd have faith
[1:56:50] because faith could save me." Amen.
[1:56:52] Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Or you could sit in the prison and said,
[1:56:55] "I'm doomed.
[1:56:59] There's no way.
[1:57:02] Tomorrow morning I'm going to be
[1:57:03] electrocuted."
[1:57:06] And like most people, they begin to lie
[1:57:08] to themselves. I never did it. And and
[1:57:10] I'm innocent and they're guilty of sin.
[1:57:15] And they start lying to themselves.
[1:57:19] They start creating a false world that
[1:57:21] they're looking at things through.
[1:57:24] They look at the past and it's the
[1:57:26] source of all their troubles.
[1:57:31] Your past isn't the source of any of
[1:57:34] your troubles.
[1:57:38] Your past is not going to keep you from
[1:57:41] what God's predestinated you to be.
[1:57:45] [snorts]
[1:57:48] If your name's written on the Lamb's
[1:57:50] Book of Life, you will be there.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you were treated. I
[1:57:55] don't care what you went through. I
[1:57:56] don't care about your mental battles. I
[1:57:59] don't care about your failures. If you
[1:58:01] want to look at that, look at that.
[1:58:04] It's not going to change where you're
[1:58:06] going to be.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're saying you believe in
[1:58:13] predestination? Yeah.
[1:58:16] I believe in predestination.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I believe my name's written on the
[1:58:20] Lamb's book of life.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I believe I got a lot of terrible
[1:58:24] history, but it's not going to keep me
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; from being where he predestinated me to
[1:58:29] be before the foundation of the world.
[1:58:32] Like I told a friend of mine, I said,
[1:58:34] "You know, really what I love about
[1:58:36] eternal life
[1:58:38] is when you get when you get into
[1:58:41] eternal life, heaven and earth passes
[1:58:44] away. [crying]
[1:58:48] So you go back to where you were before
[1:58:52] heaven and earth was here.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; So you never really done it in the first
[1:58:57] place.
[1:59:00] Amen.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; How you want to look at it?
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; How do you want to walk through life?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Do you want to walk through life without
[1:59:14] faith? Do you want to look at walk
[1:59:16] through life considering all the
[1:59:17] negative? You want to walk through life
[1:59:19] saying this world's true and what
[1:59:21] Satan's true and what Brent Baird says
[1:59:24] is true and what Jesse Waters says is
[1:59:26] true and what what's that other crazy
[1:59:28] woman on that other station says is
[1:59:30] true.
[1:59:34] What are you going to believe is true?
[1:59:36] Let every word of man be a lie
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; and every word of God be true.
[1:59:50] It's when we start believing God's word.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Now, you can argue with me about high
[1:59:59] heels and tight dresses. Alls I wanted
[2:00:02] you to do was go back and look at where
[2:00:05] they started and why they were made.
[2:00:09] [snorts]
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; It ain't a law.
[2:00:14] [snorts]
[2:00:17] You want to wear them,
[2:00:20] I can't stop you,
[2:00:24] okay? But it's I'm obligated to tell
[2:00:27] you, you can't walk into the kingdom of
[2:00:30] God with them. So, make your
[2:00:35] choice.
[2:00:39] Choose by faith.
[2:00:44] I can't preach against games. I'm sure
[2:00:47] that playing a game every now and then
[2:00:49] is fine.
[2:00:51] I I knew a young man had a full
[2:00:54] scholarship
[2:00:56] to the best
[2:00:58] geological
[2:01:01] school there is for drilling and oil and
[2:01:04] those things. and he lost his
[2:01:07] scholarship because he got caught up in
[2:01:10] some war game
[2:01:14] two or three into the morning because he
[2:01:16] was almost there.
[2:01:18] You know, those games are designed to
[2:01:22] get you almost there.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; And you go down a whole way of thinking
[2:01:28] and a whole way of pushing your thumbs.
[2:01:32] Just look at yourself.
[2:01:38] and you're there. You Oh, I got it. And
[2:01:42] it's programmed to get you to go this
[2:01:45] way and then drop a bomb.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; And then you're back again. And then you
[2:01:52] know where you're next? You're going to
[2:01:54] all the cheat sites that got all the the
[2:01:58] you know where you can get the answer.
[2:02:00] So now you're not playing the game
[2:02:01] anymore. You're cheating.
[2:02:04] just to so you can say yourself, "I did
[2:02:06] it." No, you didn't. You're a cheater.
[2:02:11] And you want the bottom line? You just
[2:02:13] wasted about 500 hours of your life
[2:02:17] looking at a stupid screen pressing
[2:02:20] buttons.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't care how you want to look
[2:02:27] at it. If you want to look at yourself
[2:02:30] as being some sort of intellectual giant
[2:02:33] because you got trapped into playing
[2:02:35] some stupid video game, have at it.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Go down to Hobby Lobby and buy yourself
[2:02:43] a crown
[2:02:48] and put it on your head.
[2:02:51] Say, "I'm king of video games."
[2:02:58] Does anybody know who won the 1957 World
[2:03:00] Series?
[2:03:06] Nobody remembers those guys.
[2:03:09] Big deal.
[2:03:13] You win the Super Bowl,
[2:03:17] Monday, it's over.
[2:03:21] They hang a little thing up there says
[2:03:23] Super Bowl champ.
[2:03:25] 1957.
[2:03:27] Big deal.
[2:03:30] What did he just tell us? Those things
[2:03:35] perish.
[2:03:45] Look to the invisible.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Let's just finish today. It says, "Now,
[2:03:53] if we lose faith, then we'll never get a
[2:03:57] prayer answered by God." [snorts]
[2:04:02] It's not the praying,
[2:04:07] it's the faith.
[2:04:10] Like I said, if you come to the altar
[2:04:14] and you could pray and pray, but if it's
[2:04:16] not mixed with faith, it doesn't do you
[2:04:20] any good.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; But if you come with faith, I'm going to
[2:04:25] go there and I'm going to pray and when
[2:04:29] I'm done praying, I'm leaving it there.
[2:04:34] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[2:04:38] them there
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; by faith.
[2:04:42] Whatever convicted you to bring you to
[2:04:45] the altar, there is a promise of healing
[2:04:50] for that.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; It's what you're looking for.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; It's what you believe.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Faith is what makes
[2:05:01] the altar call.
[2:05:04] come to life.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; It's not getting the people to the
[2:05:09] altar.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; I watched Billy Graham bring 40,000
[2:05:16] people at one time to the altar. Prophet
[2:05:18] of God said he goes back and he can't
[2:05:20] find 30.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Why? It wasn't mixed with faith.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't mixed with the changing of how
[2:05:30] you look at the circumstance.
[2:05:34] If you come to the altar and your
[2:05:37] thinking is not changed when you get up,
[2:05:40] you're going to walk back with the same
[2:05:42] thing.
[2:05:52] at things.
[2:05:54] Boy, that's a whole definition of faith,
[2:05:56] isn't it?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; You mean I change the way I see things
[2:06:00] and things change? Yes.
[2:06:05] If you don't mix it with faith, you
[2:06:08] don't get a prayer answered.
[2:06:11] You can throw all your problems up all
[2:06:13] day long.
[2:06:16] But if you don't believe once you give
[2:06:17] him you commit it into his hands that
[2:06:20] he's going to take it, then what good is
[2:06:22] it do you?
[2:06:25] If you don't believe he heard you,
[2:06:28] if you don't believe he answered you,
[2:06:34] all you're doing is offloading
[2:06:39] for a little while.
[2:06:42] I'm just going to dump this thing off of
[2:06:44] me for a little while.
[2:06:46] You know, the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:06:49] doesn't mean you're not going to
[2:06:51] remember.
[2:06:56] And the baptism of the Holy Spirit does
[2:06:57] not mean that Satan's not going to tempt
[2:07:00] you and torment you.
[2:07:03] [snorts]
[2:07:05] So many people come wanting the baptism
[2:07:07] of the Holy Spirit, and really what
[2:07:10] they're wanting is Satan, leave me
[2:07:12] alone.
[2:07:15] If I had the Holy Ghost, I wouldn't be
[2:07:18] tempted. If I had the Holy Ghost, I
[2:07:20] wouldn't be tormented. If I had the Holy
[2:07:23] Ghost,
[2:07:25] no.
[2:07:27] Get the Holy Ghost. Satan fires it up.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; He'll make you prove every statement
[2:07:34] that comes out of your mouth.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the seal
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; unto the day of your redemption.
[2:07:44] It means that you go through the trials.
[2:07:46] The trials are in your path. You don't
[2:07:49] bring them upon yourself. Did you like
[2:07:51] what he said? You just brought this upon
[2:07:53] yourself. So many people, oh, you
[2:07:56] brought it upon yourself. You were lazy
[2:07:59] at work. You got fired. That ain't the
[2:08:01] devil.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; The devil's not dumb enough to do a
[2:08:08] bunch of the stuff we accuse him of.
[2:08:11] We've brought it on ourselves.
[2:08:14] If you start looking at things through
[2:08:17] the eyes of faith, you'll make a
[2:08:20] judgment and determination of yourself.
[2:08:22] And when you're wrong, you'll cry, "Aba,
[2:08:24] Father, and you'll make things right."
[2:08:29] But when you get an illusion
[2:08:33] and you things are going to go away and
[2:08:36] the devil's going to go away and life's
[2:08:38] going to be rosy and and I need the Holy
[2:08:40] Ghost, I need the Holy Ghost. I need the
[2:08:43] Holy Ghost. You need faith.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; The foundation of a statue of a perfect
[2:08:51] man is faith.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:56] Believe first.
[2:09:00] If you're convicted of sin, know father,
[2:09:03] you've convicted me of this sin because
[2:09:06] you're going to forgive me
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; and you're going to give me the strength
[2:09:10] and the power to overcome because it's
[2:09:13] given to the overcomer.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; You don't need to admit guilt. He knows
[2:09:19] what you did before you ever confessed
[2:09:21] it.
[2:09:26] He doesn't want you to believe you're
[2:09:27] guilty. He wants you to believe he's
[2:09:29] your redeemer.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; He's your deliverer.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; He's your power.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; He wants you to believe that joy,
[2:09:44] he's got joy unspeakable and full of
[2:09:47] glory. He wants you to believe that you
[2:09:50] can have peace that surpasses
[2:09:52] understanding.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; He wants us to start turning down all
[2:09:56] the negativity, all the lies, and start
[2:10:00] changing the way that we look at things
[2:10:02] and look at things through the glorious
[2:10:04] eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe you had a rough past.
[2:10:15] Maybe you suffered.
[2:10:17] You know what you can do is you can
[2:10:18] raise your hand and say, "I suffered.
[2:10:20] But if I suffered with him, I'll reign
[2:10:22] with them also.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not the brightest block on
[2:10:31] the street.
[2:10:33] Maybe God didn't give you great
[2:10:35] intellectual
[2:10:37] understanding.
[2:10:39] Maybe sometimes you feel like a
[2:10:46] You want to look at yourself that way.
[2:10:48] How about looking at yourself and say,
[2:10:50] you know, God came to the poor in this
[2:10:52] world, rich in faith.
[2:10:58] Nowadays, we think only smart people
[2:11:02] are Christians,
[2:11:06] only the intellectual,
[2:11:08] only those that can that can perceive
[2:11:11] and understand doctrine and and know all
[2:11:14] these things. And oh, that's the church.
[2:11:18] That's the message. That's the
[2:11:20] anointing.
[2:11:22] No, it's not. He didn't come to restore
[2:11:28] doctrine. He came to restore faith.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Simple faith.
[2:11:36] This promise is mine.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; In closing, he makes these things.
[2:11:43] If we lose faith, we'll never get a
[2:11:46] prayer answered by God. For he that
[2:11:49] cometh to God must first
[2:11:53] believe.
[2:11:57] When you come to the altar, you're
[2:11:59] coming to God, right?
[2:12:02] Right. First of all, you must believe
[2:12:05] that he is
[2:12:07] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[2:12:11] seek after him. You're coming to the
[2:12:14] altar.
[2:12:16] You're diligently seeking after God. If
[2:12:19] you don't mix that
[2:12:22] with the faith of reward,
[2:12:28] you won't get anything.
[2:12:32] But if you come
[2:12:34] knowing he hears you, knowing he'll
[2:12:37] reward you,
[2:12:39] knowing he'll do for you what you're
[2:12:42] asking him to do. Get up from that
[2:12:46] place, raise your hands, and say, "Thank
[2:12:49] you, Lord God. You heard my prayer.
[2:12:53] Whatever I've asked of you is on the way
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to let any devil in
[2:12:59] hell take it away from me.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Once you mix it with faith,
[2:13:05] it becomes profitable. But without
[2:13:07] faith,
[2:13:09] it doesn't do you one bit of good. So if
[2:13:12] we lose faith, our prayers are enulled.
[2:13:16] We get nowhere.
[2:13:21] Now that's stern, isn't it? But aren't
[2:13:25] you glad you know that?
[2:13:30] I believe that.
[2:13:32] So all that we can think of this morning
[2:13:38] is to hold on to faith.
[2:13:42] Then if we lose faith,
[2:13:45] all our hopes are gone.
[2:13:52] Faith's our only hope.
[2:13:55] You're sick, faith's your only hope.
[2:13:59] You're depressed, faith's your only
[2:14:01] hope. Faith is the door. Faith is
[2:14:04] deliverance. Faith is everything.
[2:14:11] You and faith is the simple change
[2:14:17] of looking at it. the way it's perceived
[2:14:20] in the world or the way it's perceived
[2:14:23] in God's word.
[2:14:25] And now you change the way you look at
[2:14:28] it. He says,
[2:14:34] "And if we lose faith,
[2:14:37] all our spiritual reality
[2:14:41] is gone."
[2:14:44] the spiritual reality that God does
[2:14:48] things in an unseen
[2:14:52] miraculous way.
[2:14:56] Now, maybe you're not interested in God.
[2:15:00] Maybe you don't care. Maybe this world
[2:15:02] is so big,
[2:15:04] so heavy,
[2:15:08] so depressing.
[2:15:13] so down.
[2:15:15] You hate school. You hate living at
[2:15:18] home.
[2:15:20] You hate the rules.
[2:15:22] You hate all those things. You all you
[2:15:25] want to do just let me go. Let me I want
[2:15:27] to go to the mall. I want to get in my
[2:15:30] car. I want to do what I want to do.
[2:15:35] You know what happens? You have no
[2:15:37] spiritual reality.
[2:15:39] The reality
[2:15:41] that we're leaving
[2:15:43] and the reality that this world is going
[2:15:46] to burn
[2:15:48] escapes us.
[2:15:51] I don't want to be stuck with a carnal
[2:15:54] reality. Do you? I want to have a
[2:15:57] spiritual reality. How do you have a
[2:16:00] spiritual reality? There's only one way
[2:16:04] to have a spiritual reality and that's
[2:16:07] to change the way you look at things.
[2:16:16] Maybe that's a bigger challenge this
[2:16:18] morning
[2:16:19] than I realize.
[2:16:22] But stop and think, how are you looking
[2:16:27] at things?
[2:16:31] we lose all our spirituality.
[2:16:33] For you cannot have faith in things that
[2:16:36] you see. For the things that you see are
[2:16:40] all perishable.
[2:16:43] And then I'll read this last thing and
[2:16:45] I'll close because there's so much more
[2:16:49] in here. He says,
[2:16:53] [clears throat] and I'll read this
[2:16:55] paragraph. It was about the sculpture.
[2:16:59] Remember he said they looked at the
[2:17:01] sculpture and from the outside it looked
[2:17:04] terrible. What is this thing?
[2:17:08] And they criticized it. But when he
[2:17:09] said, "You get down here. Get down
[2:17:11] here." And he got on his knees and then
[2:17:15] he looked up at the sculpture
[2:17:18] the way that it was made to be looked
[2:17:21] at.
[2:17:25] when he looked at it the way that it was
[2:17:27] meant to be looked at. Does the world
[2:17:30] look ugly?
[2:17:32] That's because it's the way you're
[2:17:34] looking at it.
[2:17:39] It's Satan's kingdom.
[2:17:43] It's meant to be ugly.
[2:17:46] You're not meant to fit into it. You're
[2:17:49] not meant to be here.
[2:17:53] That's why he's not going to leave you
[2:17:55] here.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; You're not meant to go through this life
[2:18:01] with a carnal mind.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; The carnal mind is emanate with God, but
[2:18:07] the spiritual mind is life. You're meant
[2:18:10] to live by faith.
[2:18:13] By believing every word of God is true.
[2:18:17] You're you're created to live by faith.
[2:18:20] My God can do all things. All things are
[2:18:23] possible.
[2:18:28] You're you're made to to to think not to
[2:18:32] have a negative thought. You're made to
[2:18:34] believe that when you read the scripture
[2:18:37] that what you're reading is what's true.
[2:18:42] You're made to change
[2:18:45] the whole way you've been taught
[2:18:49] through civilization, education, and
[2:18:52] culture to look at the world.
[2:18:56] You were made to have your mind
[2:18:58] transformed by the washing of the water
[2:19:02] of the word of God.
[2:19:06] and your peace is in your faith in God's
[2:19:11] word.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:19:16] he said, "Mr.
[2:19:18] Spellel, this statue is right and the
[2:19:23] sculpture had the right thing in his
[2:19:26] mind. But where the trouble is is with
[2:19:32] you.
[2:19:38] Where the trouble is is with me.
[2:19:47] Can that just set in for a moment?
[2:19:54] It's not the trouble,
[2:19:57] whatever that trouble might be.
[2:20:00] It's you.
[2:20:03] It's how you're looking at the trouble.
[2:20:07] It's how you're looking at the trial.
[2:20:10] It's how you're looking at the
[2:20:12] circumstance.
[2:20:14] He says,
[2:20:17] he says, "The trouble is with you. It's
[2:20:21] the way you're looking at it.
[2:20:25] The trouble is with us, with me. The way
[2:20:30] I'm looking at it. Now, someone might
[2:20:34] not think this is a very deep sermon,
[2:20:36] but this is deep.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; It's the separator.
[2:20:43] [snorts]
[2:20:46] It's like the the people that when the
[2:20:50] golden calf came, you know why they got
[2:20:53] a golden calf? Because they wanted to
[2:20:55] take that golden calf and go back into
[2:20:58] Egypt.
[2:21:02] But there were those
[2:21:06] that saw it different.
[2:21:11] And there is a separation.
[2:21:14] And God's wanting us to separate from
[2:21:19] the way that we're looking at things and
[2:21:22] start looking at things through faith,
[2:21:25] through the power of God, through the
[2:21:28] baptism of the Holy Spirit, knowing that
[2:21:30] every word of God can come to pass in
[2:21:33] our life.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Get rid of the negative.
[2:21:38] He's already thrown your sins in the sea
[2:21:40] of God forgetfulness. He wants to be
[2:21:43] real to you. And that's what he does.
[2:21:46] Have you ever just been somewhere? I
[2:21:47] remember the first time I felt the
[2:21:50] presence of the Lord. Why? I I just sat
[2:21:53] there and and and
[2:21:56] quivered. I didn't even know what it
[2:21:58] was.
[2:22:01] He was making himself real.
[2:22:07] Listen how beautiful this is. It's the
[2:22:09] way you're looking at it. He to he took
[2:22:15] he and his wife by the hand and led them
[2:22:17] down to the altar at the foot of this
[2:22:22] said cross. And he said, "Now look up
[2:22:26] now." And when he looked up, his heart
[2:22:30] like to have failed him. What a
[2:22:32] difference it was.
[2:22:36] to stand off there and look at it that
[2:22:39] way and to get down and look at it the
[2:22:44] way that it was made to look at.
[2:22:49] It's one thing to stand off and look at
[2:22:51] the word of God,
[2:22:54] [snorts]
[2:22:55] but it's one thing to get down and to
[2:22:57] know how he wants the word of God to be
[2:23:01] looked at.
[2:23:04] How do you look at the word of God?
[2:23:08] It's a reality.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; It's a promise.
[2:23:13] It's the truth. The word of God is what
[2:23:17] will be.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; If you mix it with faith, it will be
[2:23:24] everything it said it would be. Now,
[2:23:28] listen how he closes. That's the way
[2:23:31] that God is.
[2:23:35] That's the way faith is.
[2:23:39] It's the way you look at it.
[2:23:49] Do you look at a historical Bible
[2:23:53] or do you look at the same God
[2:23:56] that made the promise is alive? What
[2:24:00] good does this Bible do us if it's not
[2:24:03] the same God?
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; What good does this message do us if
[2:24:09] it's not the same God?
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; If it's not the same spirit to bring
[2:24:15] every promise in this book to pass.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; What good does it do us if we don't feel
[2:24:23] this word of God is every bit alive
[2:24:26] today as it always was? that he's the
[2:24:29] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[2:24:32] knows what we have need of even before
[2:24:35] we ask. That our footsteps are ordered
[2:24:38] by the Lord.
[2:24:40] What good does it do that we don't have
[2:24:42] the same faith? And and then you we
[2:24:45] always are wondering what faith is and
[2:24:47] then this very simple reality comes
[2:24:51] forth. We say faith is a revelation. You
[2:24:54] what does a revelation do? It changes
[2:24:57] the way that you look at it.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; And you change the way you look at it.
[2:25:05] The choosing
[2:25:08] by faith.
[2:25:11] You choose how you want to look at it.
[2:25:20] Punishment or test.
[2:25:24] failing or victory,
[2:25:28] sickness or healing, depression or
[2:25:32] deliverance.
[2:25:35] Think it not strange the enemy is going
[2:25:37] to come against us.
[2:25:41] But we are more than conquerors
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; who deliver us from all things.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; How do you want to look at it?
[2:25:53] Do you want a big negative
[2:25:56] view or do you want to take God's word
[2:25:58] and say, you know, there's a promise in
[2:26:01] there for that?
[2:26:04] It's by these great and exceedingly
[2:26:06] precious promises that we become
[2:26:09] partakers
[2:26:11] of divine nature.
[2:26:14] Moses chose
[2:26:17] faith
[2:26:22] He had a choice.
[2:26:24] He chose faith. [snorts]
[2:26:28] And that's what prophet of God said. My
[2:26:30] sermon today to the church in its
[2:26:34] condition
[2:26:36] is to choose faith.
[2:26:41] I hope I could just make that a reality
[2:26:44] and that you would just think about it.
[2:26:47] [clears throat]
[2:26:48] Every decision you make is made by
[2:26:52] faith. What you choose to believe, the
[2:26:58] word
[2:27:00] or the accusation,
[2:27:03] the truth
[2:27:06] or the situation.
[2:27:09] Daniel didn't look at the situation.
[2:27:14] Nebuchadnezzar
[2:27:16] threw the Shadrach, Mishak, Neb in a
[2:27:20] fiery furnace. And when he heated the
[2:27:23] furnace up and he opened the doors and
[2:27:26] the two guards that opened the gourds
[2:27:28] instantly perished.
[2:27:33] They made a choice
[2:27:36] how they were going to look at it.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh king, live forever.
[2:27:41] Our God
[2:27:46] is able
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; to save us
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; faith.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; But if he doesn't,
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; we will not bow to an idol.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay true to his word
[2:28:00] regardless of the test.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; You just heard our messenger say that.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; And they threw him into the fiery
[2:28:08] furnace.
[2:28:12] We want the miracle before the furnace,
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; but faith will take you into the furnace
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; and bring you back out.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Daniel in the lion's den.
[2:28:28] Put him in there.
[2:28:31] It looked like he was lying food.
[2:28:37] Oh, king. Bless you.
[2:28:42] I didn't mean to to disrespect the king,
[2:28:47] but I bow to my God as I'm taught. I
[2:28:50] turn my heart to Jerusalem
[2:28:53] and I prayer the prayers of faith. And
[2:28:56] in the lion's den he went.
[2:29:00] But he didn't look at
[2:29:03] he looked at a God that was able
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; to deliver him from the lions.
[2:29:08] Hallelujah.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; And when they went there, oh Daniel,
[2:29:12] Daniel says, "Oh king, live forever. All
[2:29:15] is well."
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Why? He entered the lion's den with
[2:29:21] faith.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; He believed that God
[2:29:26] would deliver him
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; from the lions.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't look at how long it's been. He
[2:29:33] didn't look at how many men the lions
[2:29:36] have eaten. He didn't look at the pile
[2:29:38] of bones. He didn't look at how dark the
[2:29:42] cave was.
[2:29:44] He refused to look at anything that
[2:29:49] wasn't the word of God.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's what faith does. It changes the
[2:29:59] way you look at things. Now, if you
[2:30:03] could this morning just say,
[2:30:07] "I'm redeemed.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; I've been purchased by the blood of the
[2:30:13] lamb.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; My name was put on the lamb's book of
[2:30:18] life before the foundation of the world.
[2:30:21] All my sins and failures have been
[2:30:24] thrown in the sea of God's
[2:30:25] forgetfulness.
[2:30:27] And today I'm going to do my best
[2:30:31] to put him first.
[2:30:35] Not to look back,
[2:30:38] to leave those things which are behind
[2:30:40] behind. Even this morning, leave those
[2:30:44] things which are behind behind and press
[2:30:47] for a higher calling.
[2:30:52] If you could believe that's you,
[2:30:56] that he loves you,
[2:30:58] that he chose you, that he died for you,
[2:31:03] that he will not leave you nor forsake
[2:31:07] you, but he'll be with you, even in you
[2:31:11] till the end.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; That he'll deliver you out of every
[2:31:16] trouble.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:18] out of every failure. And if you fail,
[2:31:24] you cry, "Aba, Father,
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; and he's just and faithful to forgive
[2:31:30] you.
[2:31:35] We've got to change
[2:31:38] the way we look at things."
[2:31:43] Faith is the way you look at things. I
[2:31:48] hope that as simple as it might sound
[2:31:51] this morning,
[2:31:53] there's so much more in here that we
[2:31:55] could discuss this morning.
[2:31:58] But mix your prayers with faith.
[2:32:04] We have not
[2:32:06] because we ask not.
[2:32:09] And when we ask, we
[2:32:12] believe not.
[2:32:14] But if thou will believe,
[2:32:17] all things are possible.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Only
[2:32:23] believe.
[2:32:24] God bless you. Let's stand this morning.
[2:32:34] [snorts]
[2:32:39] How do you look at yourself this
[2:32:41] morning?
[2:32:43] Well, I I know the failures.
[2:32:47] I have a devil that has a notebook
[2:32:51] and [clears throat] he keeps track
[2:32:54] [snorts] every day of everything I say,
[2:32:58] everything I do, everything I do there.
[2:33:01] But you know, there's another song I
[2:33:03] sing. It says, "I am redeemed
[2:33:08] by the blood of the lamb."
[2:33:11] You know that song? I am redeemed
[2:33:16] by the blood of the lamb.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed [singing]
[2:33:23] by the blood of the lamb.
[2:33:26] I am redeemed [singing and music] by the
[2:33:28] blood of the lamb. Saved and sanctified.
[2:33:33] I am all my sins are under the blood. I
[2:33:37] am redeemed.
[2:33:41] Redeemed
[2:33:44] by the blood of the lamb.
[2:33:47] I've been redeemed
[2:33:51] by the blood of the lamb.
[2:33:54] I've been redeemed [music and singing]
[2:33:56] by the blood of the lamb. Saved and
[2:33:59] sanctified. I am all my sins are
[2:34:03] unplugged. I've been redeemed. Oh. Oh.
[2:34:08] But you can talk about me.
[2:34:12] All that [music] you please.
[2:34:15] You can talk about [singing] me.
[2:34:19] All that you.
[2:34:22] You can talk about me. All that you
[2:34:26] [music] talk about you down on high.
[2:34:30] All my sins are on the blood. I've been
[2:34:34] redeemed.
[2:34:36] And that's not all.
[2:34:40] There's more [music] beside.
[2:34:43] And [singing] that's not all. [music]
[2:34:47] There's more beside.
[2:34:50] And that's not all. There's still
[2:34:53] beside. I've been to the river and I've
[2:34:56] been baptized.
[2:34:58] All my sins are [music]
[2:35:01] I will be
[2:35:05] sin washed away.
[2:35:11] I don't know that verse
[2:35:21] got so close. He saved me and he filled
[2:35:24] me with the Holy Ghost. for my sin is
[2:35:30] I've been redeemed.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, isn't that pretty good if you
[2:35:36] start looking at yourself that way?
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Brother McGary, I know you.
[2:35:43] I know
[2:35:45] that you're a real grumpy old man,
[2:35:50] but you want to know something? God
[2:35:52] doesn't look at you the way you look at
[2:35:55] yourself.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; He don't.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; He looks at you through the shed blood.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, when did he do
[2:36:05] that?" Well, you were yet a sinner.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; What a way to look at life.
[2:36:16] In other words, now through him, I know
[2:36:18] I can overcome anything.
[2:36:22] No lust, no hatred, no nothing that I
[2:36:27] can't overcome through the Lord Jesus.
[2:36:33] What if the Lord blessed you and filled
[2:36:35] you with the spirit and you didn't
[2:36:37] accept it as being the baptism of the
[2:36:39] Holy Spirit? You didn't look at it as
[2:36:42] being the baptism. [music] It wouldn't
[2:36:44] stay with you.
[2:36:47] But if you look at it that this is God
[2:36:49] fulfilling his promise [music] in my
[2:36:51] life. I have a promise. Every single one
[2:36:54] of you in here are promised through the
[2:36:57] blood of Jesus Christ that his spirit
[2:37:00] will dwell in you.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; It might be different for every [music]
[2:37:05] one of you, but it's his promise.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; So you believe the promise.
[2:37:13] I can't create the fulfillment of the
[2:37:16] [music] promise, but I can tell you if
[2:37:19] you've been baptized in the name of the
[2:37:21] Lord Jesus Christ, you will receive the
[2:37:26] Holy Spirit. [music]
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; That's thus saith the word of God.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; So fear not, little flock. It's a
[2:37:36] father's good pleasure to give you the
[2:37:39] kingdom. Why not walk out the door and
[2:37:41] say, "Fear not, little flock. It's the
[2:37:44] father's good pleasure to give me the
[2:37:46] kingdom." What a different way to look
[2:37:48] at life. Oh, if you could look at that
[2:37:51] life that way, it would be so much
[2:37:56] so much more [music] wonderful than
[2:38:00] anything. Is victory yours? Let's sing
[2:38:02] as we get brother Ben [music] to finish
[2:38:03] up this morning. Victory is mine.
[2:38:08] Oh, is it? Victory is mine.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the battle is. David
[2:38:13] went down to face Goliath.
[2:38:17] He didn't look at Goliath.
[2:38:19] He looked at the God that delivered the
[2:38:21] bear and lion. [music] It's how he
[2:38:24] looked at it is what changed the
[2:38:26] outcome. Cuz victory is mine. Amen.
[2:38:30] Oh, when I woke up [music and singing]
[2:38:33] this morning, I didn't have a doubt. I
[2:38:38] knew [music and singing] that the Lord
[2:38:40] would bring me out.
[2:38:43] So I got down on my knees. My Lord
[2:38:47] [music] helped me.
[2:38:50] And I got up singing and shouting, "The
[2:38:52] victory."
[2:38:56] Oh, victory [music]
[2:38:57] is one.
[2:38:59] Victory is
[2:39:02] victory.
[2:39:15] victory.
[2:39:17] [music]

[2:43:19] Hallelujah.
[2:43:21] Hallelujah.
[2:43:24] Somebody Caleb [music] Miles is here.
[2:43:25] Don't know if he's still in.
[2:43:32] Is he here? Ah, he left. We'll ask
[2:43:35] brother Davey to come and close our
[2:43:36] service in a [music] word of prayer.
[2:43:55] What a victorious message. Amen. Faith
[2:43:58] is the victory.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God lest any man should
[2:44:02] boast.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him. Heavenly
[2:44:05] Father, truly you've delivered to us all
[2:44:07] things. And [music]
[2:44:08] Lord, we just want to give you the glory
[2:44:11] for what you've done. And Lord, even
[2:44:13] that we could hear this gospel is
[2:44:15] because you've given us ears to hear.
[2:44:17] And [music] Lord, that we could hear our
[2:44:19] name called and to be positioned and to
[2:44:21] be placed, Father. It's all by your
[2:44:22] grace, Lord. A grace that is so greater
[2:44:25] than our understanding. It's beyond
[2:44:26] intellect. It's beyond doctrine, [music]
[2:44:29] Father. But it's the very manifested
[2:44:30] word of God in earthn vessels, Lord.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want our faith to be quickened.
[2:44:35] We want it to be strengthened. [music]
[2:44:37] We We want it to be prosperous, Father.
[2:44:39] We wanted to accomplish what you want it
[2:44:41] to. So may your word become so visible
[2:44:44] to us, Lord, [music] that we could in in
[2:44:47] great hands of strength and faith and
[2:44:49] revelation. Use it to the tearing down
[2:44:51] of Satan's kingdom, Father, and to your
[2:44:54] glory. We ask you be with each one,
[2:44:55] Lord, that bless [music] each visitor
[2:44:57] that's been here in this service today,
[2:45:00] Father. Many may be having to travel. We
[2:45:02] ask that you'd bless them, Lord. And
[2:45:04] we'd ask, Lord, that right now that
[2:45:06] faith would settle in hearts to to look
[2:45:08] at tonight as an opportunity to be found
[2:45:10] in your presence, [music] Lord, to be
[2:45:12] found in a place where great things
[2:45:14] could be accomplished. That each lick of
[2:45:16] fire could be joined together, Lord. And
[2:45:18] it'd be, Lord, just a time of rejoicing
[2:45:21] in you and what you've done, Lord. We
[2:45:23] long to worship you, Lord. And we long
[2:45:25] even now just to be gathered together
[2:45:27] once again. May by faith each one who
[2:45:30] has faith be gathered. I pray in the
[2:45:32] name of Jesus Christ, we ask these
[2:45:34] things. [music] Amen.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:38] Hallelujah. I forgot to mention uh to
[2:45:40] remember brother Billy. He's making his
[2:45:43] way back now. I believe he texted me
[2:45:45] earlier before the service that he was
[2:45:47] just [music] getting on the plane.
