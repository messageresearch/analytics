Description:
Living For The Resurrection By Resurrection
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
March 31, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

the joy of full salvation glory glory to his oh and I ser surrender all I surrenderer all oh and all my blessed savior I Sur let's go ahead and bow our heads this morning Heavenly Father Lord as the words of that song say what a glorious salvation a complete work Lord and we lord I pray that we would take those words to heart that I surrender all Lord for one came and taught us that the path to Victory is surrender the path to life is death the path to ruling is service Lord that eternal life is living for others and father we thank you for this day and this time Lord to look with remembrance at the complete work that was done Lord we thank you for your goodness to us we thank you for putting us in this place we thank you for all that you've done Lord and the least we can do is come together and lift up your name the the least we can do is commit ourselves to you to surrender all that we may be led of you that you would direct us according to your word we commit this service to you we pray that you would have your way Lord that you'd meet each need that you'd make yourself known to each one Lord we lift you up and we give you in your word the preeminence we pray in Jesus name amen let's go ahead and be seated happy Easter there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Paul wrote that in Romans 8 and it should be no more true to us today than ever he goes on to say that for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you he goes on to say and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you you know here Paul in Romans 8 speaking of a place that we can be by him where we're living not according to the flesh but according to the spirit we're going to read Psalm 91 this morning it was on my mind as I was reading that and you know this Psalm is one of my favorites and it's different than many of the other Psalms that you find it begins he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty the secret place of the most high you know David speaks of a secret place in Psalm 27 he says in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock you know Psalm 91 is actually believed to be a continuation of Psalm 90 they were actually part of the same Psalm that over time got divided into a couple coup of chapters but Psalm 90 is actually a Psalm of Moses and it begins Lord thou H has been our Dwelling Place in all generations and then on in Psalm 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high the Lord told Moses in Exodus 33:21 behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff of the Rock Amen and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by notice in each time he says this David says in Psalm 27 he shall hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle and then here in Exodus 33 I will put thee in a cliff of the rock you see the thing about this secret place this dwelling place is he alone can put you there you know when we read Psalm 91 this morning it speaks of not just knowing about this place not just visiting but dwelling staying in this place this place that he describes to Moses there is a place by me and then one came just before Easter and said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am present tense there ye may be also a Dwelling Place a mansion in the house a cliff in the Rock notice the starting point for that secret place is always on the Rock in Psalm 27 David describes being hidden in that secret place but he says in verse 5 he shall set me up upon a rock in Exodus 33 the Lord tells Moses Thou shalt stand upon a rock and then he takes Moses and puts him in the rock you know and then one day Jesus came and said Upon This Rock will I build my church it always starts with The Rock you know from the very earliest times even from the days of Moses the Lord had his in his mind a secret place a secret secret Dwelling Place prepared by him and he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide in the shadow of the almighty or as David says in Psalm 32 Thou Art my Hiding Place not a future place but a present Dwelling Place you know often when we read Psalm 9 one it's a place we go to for encouragement when we're going through a trial or maybe we have a trouble and there's words of encouragement there for us we go to verse four that says he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust and it's absolutely a promise to us in our hour of need but notice it's a Dwelling Place not a visiting place you know it's it's more than running to him for a place of Refuge when we need him it's a Dwelling Place a staying place an Abiding Place a constant condition of being in that secret place why is it I wonder that I have to be reminded so often of where he has placed me or treat as a visiting place he says in Psalm 9915 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyth by day so if he has placed Us in this secret place and we're dwelling there why do we fear Jesus said in John 15:7 if ye abide in me let's dwell and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you the secret place verse n because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling you know toward the end of this Psalm you'll notice when we read it the wording changes starting in verse 12 the man stops speaking and God starts speaking back God starts doing the speaking it's a conversation it's Fellowship between man and God in Exodus 33:11 it says that the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend not just because he was a prophet but because he was in that secret place as we read Psalm 91 it says in verse 14 this is the Lord speaking because he hath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him the secret place of dwelling it's more than a place of Refuge it's more than a dwelling place it's a constant habitation it's a place where only he can place you but he said I go to prepare a place for you that were where I am there ye may be also let's stand this morning going to read Psalm 91 and the question as we celebrate Easter the whole reason for Easter was to go and prepare a place for you and the question is are we in that secret place that he has prepared for us do you desire to be in that secret place I go to prepare a place for you and if I go I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am present tense there ye may be also let's go ahead and read Psalm 91 this morning he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyth by day nor for the pestilence that walth in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague Come N thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder the Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because Heath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation amen God bless you may have your seats amen what a promise man let's sing it calvary years I spend in vanity oh years I spent in vanity and cry oh and caring not my Lord was good oh I knowing not he

of the Lord Jesus Christ my brother my sister and I I wish to all of you happy hister Grand Deliverance uh this great uh Feast of Deliverance when we were at the restaurant on Tuesday with the pastor he asked me to give a little testimony before I go back because I'm leaving on Tuesday the last time I was here when I came on in February the first time I came into the church uh there was a sister who spoke English she spoke to me she was excited and she had a lot of compassion toward towards me she said when they announced about the surgery at church I prayed a lot for you I I saw a visional a dream that you were going to get out of it I was I was seeing you that you were going to be in good health and go back to your home and pre and preach the gospel uh it really touched me and effectively when I came I was sick I had about five different wounds at my lower stomach that was hurting me but as I right now I feel very strong I feel like I could jump I would like to sincerely thank the pastor for the opportunities given me and the other thing my eyes had problems with it my eyes were condemned okay uh with cataract uh there's a an eye doctor here in Bedford who told me that there's no way I can see you you need to to to have surgery for the Cataract uh June of last year I was in Denver the the the eye doctor over there said that that they were going to have me to have surgery in November that there's really nothing we could do just wait for the surgery I went to Turkey in August in September when the doctor examined me it said it's not a cataract that that requires a surgery just take the glass this glasses and that'll be it I took glasses but I was uncomfortable I couldn't even read my Bible but since I came when I opened my Bible here I started reading correctly and until now everything is fine so I'd like to show my Thanksgiving to my brothers and sister the ones that testify of a lot of affections to they came to visit me even some supported me financially may God bless you richly and I know the word is being preached here I really like brother David's position he keeps you in the message and the prophet tells us stay with this message it's only thing that works may God bless you let's stand this morning and let's open our Bibles to Philippians we just want to read a a portion um trusting that uh we'll try to uh not be too long this morning and many of you like to try to have Easter dinner and you've got guest and we surely want you to spend as much time with them as you can this is a a a a great uh chapter to me uh for a lot of reasons but I I feel that Paul in this chapter the 13th uh third chapter of Philippians kind of sum up uh the purpose of a Christian Life and uh we'll just say a few words on that and then we'll continue on this morning and we just want to pick up uh read from the 8th verse uh through the 14th verse and it says yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ and the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might obtain unto the resurrection of the Dead that is not as though I have already obtained neither were already per perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto the things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore also as many as be perfect be thus minded and if any ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you you may be seated I believe that's the High Calling of every Christian is to strive for the resurrection and I believe that's what Paul was saying here that I live my life for the resurrection that I might obtain the resurrection he said not that I've already obtained it but I I I press towards it that I might apprehend it and and this morning that's what uh I just have a little thought I'd like to leave for Easter with you uh something that uh might carry uh with you the days of your lives that you're here and I I wanted to title this living for the resurrection by the resurrection living for the resurrection by the the resurrection and you know uh you know Resurrection means to restore to life and uh so you know like if I was to ask you a Bible quiz this morning uh how many people know how many resurrections there were in the Bible Well it's commonly spoken 10 not that have already happened and possibly three more that are to happen and some people count the resurrection of Israel as being a resurrection but there was 10 uh resurrections in the scripture 10 resurrections in the scripture how many uh people were Resurrected nobody knows and we'll explain that in just a little bit but what we want to talk about this morning with you just for a moment is that Resurrection changes things yes and that is the what Changed History what changed man what changed religion which changed the direction of and course of human beings has been influential all through time was the resurrection we uh in our lives uh we are confronted with all of us are confronted with one thing in common and that is death and death is a is just something that we've always approached as being the finality or the end of the matter uh you know if you take uh somebody that's uh that has died or somebody that is dead uh we mark their memory and possibly we Mark the time that they were born and the time that they passed away the years that they've spent uh here in life but we always feel that that death and man has always looked at death is that well this is the end that uh that a person lived this long and and that was their life and and uh we we said goodbye to them and we went through a period of mourning and then we would have to set our our hopes back on the life that we had to live our survival our everyday uh toils and snares that we have to deal with and and and just the burden of life knowing that we too would come to this place and it was always a question in man it was a question in Job that what what happens uh the flower Withers away things come and go the sun sets and goes but what happens to a man and then one day was revealed to job that though the skin worms eat my flesh yet I'll see God and and that's the hope of the Resurrection is that this life is not the end of us it's not the end of the matter it's not the it's not the final conclusion and until man had resurrection that was one thing that man could never overcome he could never overcome death as I I I wrote I think probably the most helpless uh uh person we would we would say and and uh I hope that I can say this in a matter of respect but we we would look that that someone that had passed away as being the most helpless person there is in other words they can't help themselves and you can't help them so they lying in the state of death or uh in that state that we would say that that that person is helpless I mean there's nothing can be done I mean even when they they called Jesus they ran to him quickly and said don't come you know it it it's all already over uh the Danel passed away so it's it's it's just the thought that person comes into that something has reached its final uh final destiny its final conclusion its final result that this is the way it is and this is the way it's going to be it's run its course and it's over and and that thinking and and that uh uh mindset and everything has helped people C cope with things for years all right this is just the way that it is and and uh nothing can be done and I've come to the end of the matter and uh I'm stuck in this situation and this is the way that it's going to be but Paul said that I I want to live uh by the power of the resurrection and and I just want to Fellowship just a little bit this morning with you about the power of the resurrection and and what that power is and what the ability and how far reaching uh the power of the Resurrection is because it's it's not a power of man it's got to come from a source of man it's got so a man can't is comes to the end of his limit and and our Nature by coming to the end of the limit we just begin to settle in and we begin to make adjustments and we begin to make change things and and position Things based on our conclusion of the matter so this is the way it is this is the way it's going to be I'm stuck with it I'm stuck in this position I'm stuck with this the rest of my life I'm going to live this way now I'm going to make adjustments to to live this way I'm going to plan to live this way I'm going to let this have the effect on me that now I'm going to think this way right so I I've just brought myself into subjection to the the situation so just like we would take death and we would think that this is the end of it and and we're just going to adjust by it and and that's why this morning that I I I'm saying living by the resurrection you know uh uh you live for it and as a Christian Paul says I live for the resurrection but to live by the resurrection and the the hope of the resurrection and that's what our hope is today as Christians we're living believing that death is not our final end it's not the end of the matter for us we have a hope as Christians and and Easter gave us that hope that Jesus Christ rose from the dead he he had taken death hell in the grave and he conquered it and through that we realize that there's life after death so many of us think of Resurrection as only being life after death so for the power of the Resurrection is the power to uh have an effect on us after death but what I just want to say to us this morning that there is a power of the Resurrection that lives yes there's a power of the Resurrection that can be in our lives and if we just walk through the scriptures and I I love Bible stories uh I I try to a lot of times put myself in the story you know if I was this person or I was this situation and and uh uh you know the first story of a resurrection in the Bible is in First Kings the 17th chapter and it it was the woman of zepher and we know the story Elijah came through that Coast in that time and and uh and he was living there and uh people would come to him with their problems and and he would tell them uh what to do a a a a widow and came to him one time and said uh uh you know I have a great debt to pay and I can't make this debt and they're going to take my son in the slavery and and so he told her he said well go get every vessel that you can get from all your friends gather as many pots and as many vessels as you can gather and and so he they she gathered up all the vessels and she poured them out and Elijah prayed and the vessels were filled with with oil and then he told her go sell the oil and and pay the the debt and then you and your son can rest the rest of your days of her life you know in a way she was resurrected from her debt from from the the effect that that debt was going to have on her life and what it meant to her to have her son go into servitude to uh wait possibly for him to labor as a slave until the Year of Jubilee that that that she was going to have to be set to live with that so that became a bondage to her or a chain to her just think of what it was to to have to sell her son into slavery because of the debt that she and her family had uh uh gathered and and and and created so now she's going to create the burden and her son's going to have to pay the consequence to it now think of that uh how would that make you feel and I'm I'm trying to get to something that's why that I'm trying to lay it out in this manner how how would that hurt you to to watch one of your children go away and labor because you didn't pay your bills well we would think right now that that's terrible but you know a lot of people don't realize the same thing happens when you live a life of sin you know your sins Vis are visited upon your children you know but so we look at and we we know the great story that that Elijah that there was he told the king it won't rain until I call for it and so he went up and the Ravens fed him and and uh so he he was he was being fed by raisins and uh By Ravens and then not raisins but Ravens uh so he he was fed and then the Lord told him get up and go to this widow's house so he comes to the gate and uh he says he says uh do you have anything to bring me a morsel bring me a some water and she looks at him and like you know like hey don't you know the circumstances like are you out of touch I mean I'm gathering two sticks I've got a little handful of meal and a little handful of oil and word going to mix This Together me and my son we're going to eat it and we're going to die basically good luck with the water but I'm talking about Resurrection Resurrection changes things amen and he says to her he says to her he he he says no first you take that and go make me a cake and I'll eat it and he said thus saith the Lord the The Crucible won't one dry and the meal Barrel won't be empty amen and we we know that through the time of the famine that he dwelt he lived there and he dwelt there and one day that boy became sick and he died now there's a lot of great stories and and thoughts tied with these things and she came to him and she said oh what do I have to do with you oh man of God have you remembered my sins before the Lord and and brought this upon me what do I have to do with you and again he you know we know the story that he he looked at her and he thought you know this woman was compassionate to me she believed my word you know and a lot of times we get to thinking that our sins and our things visit back upon us if you are faithful and just to confess your sins they are thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more God doesn't hold Vengeance against you if you're faithful and you repent Hallelujah and you're just he forgiv that he's not sitting back waiting someday to find something to strike you with right and we know that he gathered the child up and took it up to the room and and laid on it and the child came back to life you know there's a lot of things that stop us and keep us in bondage and guilt a lot of times is one of them remembering the past is one of them looking back on the past so the very God that spoke life to her and fed her and kept her through the drought the minute that she got in a child in a place where she lost her son and a new burden came on her life right all of a sudden she went back and visited all that she had done wrong that's what Resurrection does Resurrection he took that child back and brought that child back to life the prophet did and that resurrected changed things and surely she said surely I know that thou art a man of God and that she lived in paganism that's what she was they were pagans you know a lot of times we Fe we only judge people and we only judge the goodness of God based on whether someone agrees with our beliefs that's politics there's no politics in Christianity God's God God is love God's a good god he's merciful on whom he wants to be merciful to he extends his love be beyond measure to to people God don't hold grudges and we see that the power of the Resurrection changed that situation I don't know what kind of situation you're in but I'm telling you the power of the Resurrection The Resurrection is not future tense the resurrection is living power Paul said that I might serve him that I might live by that I might participate in the power of the resurrection and I hope that each of you this morning would realize that that's what was imputed to us yes that's what was given to us is the power of the Resurrection that we as Believers can hold the power of resurrection and Resurrection changes things oh we always looking to the Future and we're always looking to the past but it's so hard for us to really re recognize what it is that's present with us because he said if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus and what did Jesus say in John I am the resurrection and the life what was the spirit that was in Jesus it was resurrection and life I am the resurrection and life it's not something that's past tense it's something that's future tense it's not just a belief in an event but it's actually something Paul said that I can apprehend I I I I I I press to it I want to live by it I want to I want to uh uh take hold of it I want it to be what causes me to live the way that I live that I'm living for Resurrection not only future but present tense amen I guess one of the most famous resurrections is the shite woman and you know the great story The Prophet would travel by her her place and she was a a lady of well- means and her husband and and so they would invite him in for bread never hurts to do something good for somebody to go the extra mind to invite them in for some bread for a meal to share what you have with them your good will your good intentions some kind word uh something to help somebody along the way you know when the person does those type of things those things return back cast your bread upon the Water it won't return void you know don't live in a selfish little world of belief that I hope someday that I got get out of here if you're living for the resurrection live by the resurrection live by the power of the Resurrection if you're trusting it to to resurrect you and take you from the grave or take you in a Rapture then certainly you it ought to be something you can trust to live by something that you can take hold of and possess the the the the one of the first signs of Resurrection Life is the lack of selfishness why live for something you know is going to die why don't you live for something that's you know is going to change you that that's where that's where we get focused we get focused on building a career we get focused on having nice things we get focused on getting better cars and and and and what that we can uh accumulate to to make us we get to where we worry about our elderly years so we invest in the future of this life and this body so when it gets old and it can't work it can still eat and still be comforted and maybe if you don't have good children you might find a nice rest home to uh to stay in oh my now I'm not preaching this because I'm selfish but I think if you can take care of your parents you take care of them of course I want my kids to hear that but but you do you know what I mean you you you you do all that you can do but we we invest in that but a lot of times we W invest in in life itself so we know this shoe might woman she built a little she built a little Hut and a little place and and for the prophet and and he come by and he was good and one day the prophet looked at Gaz and said you know this lady's been really good to us you know what can we do for her you know she's got a lot of money she's well off and L said well she doesn't have a child and and the prophet told her he said you know he said by the time of life and season you'll be holding a child you know what she said to him don't lie to me don't lie to me don't give me false hope don't let me try to believe and hope and long for something that I've longed for all my life in other words Prophets You don't know how much burden I bore the reproach that I had to Bear not having a child all that I went through and now you're going to say that don't lie to me don't give me false hope no do this he said no you're going to have the child you know God that that's one thing about resurrection power it's hope Beyond hope it it it's power beyond every present tense circumstance she said my husband's old we're old well she must have forgot that that's how she got there being a a Jew because God dealt with some old people the Faith of Our Father so you see Resurrection is is that that's what she was dealing with she was dealing with resurrection power the the power to change the circumstance and so she went from not having a child to having a child and then after the child came of years he was working in the field and he fell dead you know he didn't throw her hands up in Despair and she knew that the power that gave her that child that resurrection power that gave her that child that that power could raise that child from the dead she saddled up and she went and she found the prophet and she brought him back and the child lived because Resurrection changes things Resurrection is present tense this is what I want to just lay deep in our soul this morning resurrection power can be lived by you can live by the power of the Resurrection you can live to know that there is a power that can change situations even death if you're dead in your trespasses and sins you're dead in your finances you're dead in your relationship in fact it just you see no life there at all Resurrection changes things Hall right it's something that can be lived by yes we've turned it into a future we've turned the resurrection into Star Trek one day we're going to be beamed up I'm not saying I'm saying it's something that's here yes sir sir it lives in The Believer it's a quickening power it'll Quicken you Paul said this is what I apprehend for this is what I live for I live for the resurrection that higher calling but I live for it by the power of the Resurrection oh I I it just the the the power is present it's something that is possessed and now when you have a possession of something is something you own is something you have amen we have separated the resurrection from ourselves it's not a carrot on a stick and this is what Paul's trying to say I I I'm I'm not perfect but I I pressed for protection I I I I haven't been resurrected but I live by the power that res can resurrect me so if something that Paul realized he said I've ran a good race I fought a good fight I go to get the crown that waits for me he knew he sat in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he knew he possessed the presence of the Lord and in that presence you cannot say that you have the Lord Jesus and not say you have resurrection power cuz he said I am the resurrection and the light I will not leave you comfortless I will come again and be in you not even in you but with you all the way to the end Resurrection is something that God has given the believer it's a token it's a it's a paid fair you don't get up in the line and say oh I'm can I get on the bus can I get on the resurrection train can I get on the ship to Zion all the types and songs that we've sang about it you know this Train's Bound for Glory you know all those things you don't get up there and say okay do I get in no the believer goes up there and we she he's got the token he's got the fair he possesses I've Got The quickening Power I've got the right to get on this I got a right to participate why cuz I have it amen I've been living by it so I hope for something and not live by it or live as if you're there looking for vocabulary to express but you take the the dead soldier the dead man they're fleeing from their enemy so they take this guy and they throw him in the grave of of Elijah that power never leaves you what do you think is going to substain you and what life are you going to have when you go to the other side you think you're getting a new life our messenger taught us the only thing that will take with us is our character you get a new body you don't get a new life cuz those that are in Christ Jesus they never die they never taste the second death they have the life so when they throws it in there there it was and boom he comes back to life because it wasn't something that comes and goes once you get it it stays with you it'll correct you when you're wrong it'll make a way for you when there's no way to be made it'll do for you exceedingly in abundantly above what you could ask or think in fact what is the holy spirit is the spirit of Jesus Christ the resurrection and the life Christ is resurrection and and so we we have those three great uh resurrections in the Old Testament and then the next Resurrection in the scriptures is Gus's daughter and I love this story because it seems seemingly everybody had given up right you know but Jesus never oh don't come don't bother the master the danzels passed away and everybody's crying and and uh you know in in certain cultures uh they they have a belief that uh if you were a good person people would be sorry that you passed away but if you were a bad person everybody would be glad you were gone so to save somebody's reputation they they would hire professional mourners and they would sit outside the house and and wait and what they whail and and cry and Carry On You know I I always was afraid that if I'd pass away someone would come by and say that's the nicest thing he ever did to me but uh but they would they would mourn you know and Carry On and the more you mourned the more it meant that was a good person and that was a good person you know I would rather have somebody rejoice because they knew that I had resurrection and life the scripture says we don't mourn as others mourn having no hope and yet I know we carry on traditions and people just you know they they weep because they want to show everybody that that's a good person I just think it's such a better testimony for a Christian praise God they've gone to be with the Lord thank you Jesus for taking my brother my sister home to where that they live the resurrection I saw the resurrection in them now what they've always wanted what they were living for they finally United with it and they've gone home they have they're not testing the grave we we laid this whole coat in the grave but they had a new one waiting for them so you know they they had had given up and and Jesus walked in and and just spoke to her and and it was over and and and that story it is so wonderful to me look the messenger shed some light on that that I I never knew until I read it he said the reason he could call her back is he knew her name was on the Lamb's Book of Life he went back there and found it and so he we ask her to come back what did Resurrection do it changed that whole situation amen so Resurrection changes things Resurrection changes things so if you have Resurrection you can what change things the next Resurrection we know in this I love this story I love them all but I've always like this story and it's the young man of uh of uh uh a nan ni I a an I guess a nan or n Jesus had just been preaching so now he's headed to the city of Nan or ni Ian however you pronounce it and he's got a great big crowd with him and so he's coming with a multitude to the people a large crowd draw the picture here comes Jesus and he's got a crowd of people Rabbi Master you know people uh shouting accolades and and people uh calling out uh uh for him to do things for him and reaching out and touching the Hem of His Garment and and so he's coming this movie and in in in coming out of the city is a widow and she's just lost her only son and she has a multitude of people with her she's sorrow her future is uncertain no doubt her son must have provided for her some way or held her status it was whatever it was she lost what would be considered her greatest possession would be her child and here though they come and she's coming out and he's coming in and the scripture says that Jesus had compassion on her he felt for her the resurrection power has compassion amen when Jesus looked out at the multitude he had compassion on him that was resurrection power that multiplied those fishes brought that bread back to life back to life back to life back to existence over and over again because he had compassion now he comes and here's life and here's death and one's coming out of the city one wants to go into City they were on a collision course right death and life they're going to meet yes something's got to give right and just like the messenger said he said if you take a good man and a bad woman or a bad man and a good woman something's got to give one's going to go one way and one was going to go the other I'm so glad that Resurrection has power over death he reached out he touched the Paul Bearer and he said young man arise and he sat up think of it how hopeless was that situation for that that mother right everybody had drawn the conclusion that this is over right this is the way it's going to be we're going to take him we're going to bury him she's going to mourn the rest of her life she's going to be a widow but that's not the way it is when you meet Resurrection Resurrection changes things amen and there's no circumstance yes sir every single one of these things we read would have been a hopeless circumstance in the eyes of men it would have been unobtainable unreachable uh no way possible in other words live with it right but when there's Resurrection around you don't have to live with the way that things are cuz Resurrection changes things yes it has the power to bring death to life to bring life into things that are dead hope to the Hopeless strength to the weary I just love that because when those two paths crossed and there's compassion involved now if there's not compassion he would have stood back with respect no doubt a gentleman he would have hushed everybody like we do or we used to do in this country when a funeral possession would come down the road we'd all pull over we'd all turn our lights on I see more and more people just drive by no respect but that was the end of that funeral possession no longer was it a funeral possession no longer was it a a a journey to the Grave I wonder what kind of evangelist he was for the kingdom I wonder how many people he went and led to the Lord because he had tasted Resurrection I was dead but now I live I was lost but now I'm found I was dead in trespasses and sin I was dead in habits I I was dead in in fear I was dead in depression I was dead in all these results but Resurrection meant me now I can testify by now I I'm not just only living for the resurrection but I'm living by the Resurrection The Resurrection that took place in me yes and may I say this what's been freely given freely give yes you have the ability if you have Resurrection to change things the life that's in you can bring people back back from the dead not only literally is the power that we have what he gave us he gave us eternal life what was eternal life eternal life was the doorway through death that's right oh death where's your string sting oh grave where's your Victory is has none it has none we could just go down through we we we talk Lazarus we know Lazarus three days dead I don't know how many days this boy was dead but it don't matter time does not affect Resurrection I don't care how long somebody's been alcoholic I don't care how long they've been a drug addict I don't know how long it been they've been possessed by by Spirits it doesn't matter Resurrection has no time frame Resurrection could come at any time any place that there's compassion there to use it yes sir you'll never have success trying to use the power of the Resurrection for any other purpose other than Divine love power apart from character is satanic but if you could live by what God done for you resurrecting you it's become so simple nowadays people just say well do you believe that Jesus Christ is your savior yes I do do you believe you're a sinner yes I do oh you're saved go live the best life you can well that's good I would rather somebody live like that but he's offered us the same power that quickened him and raised him from the dead that same Spirit can dwell in you that's so not only can you live for it so you have a person that accepts Christ as their savior they accept that they're a sinner you know they say the sinner's prayer and now they're saved they go put their book they're living for the resurrection but they're not living by the resurrection because if you're living by the resurrection you're doing the works of the resurrection and Jesus Christ says the works that I do you shall do also because you're living by the resurrection not for the resurrection and if you really want to make sure you have it live by it yes cuz your life will testify of it it'll testify if you believe that you possess something that can change things so we we we see this great Lazarus and then I said to you that nobody knows how many people were resurrected because we know at the crucifixion the graves opened and many appear years that's right the testimony that the price had been paid I love that song this morning then Sunday morning came and everything changed amen you we we were forgiven Sinners on Calvary that's right that's what the best we could hope for right as that our sins but on Sunday yes we became inheritors of the Resurrection we became recipients he said you go into the upper room and you wait until you're endued with resurrection power till you have the power from on high to change things Peter had that didn't he he had that resurrection of Life what's the first thing he does he goes down there and he says oh Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have I have Resurrection I can can change this circumstance yes this can be changed I can make a difference here I want to make a difference here he had compassion he said I don't got silver I but boy I've got something that's even better Hallelujah I got Resurrection I was in the room when when the very spirit that quickened Jesus Christ and raised him from the dead and I I saw him with my own eyes I saw CU then I went and I did what he said and that same life came back on me and I have that yes and it wasn't given to me for me it was given to me to live by it and now I'm going to live by the resurrection oh if he was living for the resurrection he would have said man don't worry one day Jesus will come back and you'll get your legs back and and you won't have to beg anymore this is our hope I'm tired of that dead church right because it doesn't represent a church living by the resurrection it represents a church living for the resurrection Peter didn't live for the resurrection he lived by the resurrection and he raised that man up we know that that great Saints at the crucifixion unnumbered but we saw the power of it it could even went and preach to the souls that were in prison that power of Resurrection spans time it's greater than every circumstance what do you think we had demonstrated to us in this day right we had a man born like any other man testimony had a temper fought ran from God but one day he meant yes he heard that old harmonica playing Adam Where Art Thou and he gave his heart to the Lord and then he doesn't just live for the resurrection he lived by the resurrection and what was he trying to show the church that the faith that was once delivered to the disciples would be restored in this day it would go from people living for it to people living by it living with the power using the power The Works that I do shall you do also why because the power that to change things now is within the believer and I'll just finish these last two then of course we know Matthew 28 1-6 was the resurrection of Jesus that's what we're celebrating today Follow by that was the resurrection of Tabatha or dorus and then we know the young man that fell asleep during church so for all of you that fall asleep in church there's still hope now you might get struck dead but we'll raise you up will we can we yes and we could read many other stories uh through this scriptures and we know there's future resurrections resurrections of the Rapture of the church resurrection of the righteous to the throne resurrection of the wicked so but we're talking this morning about a church that lives by the resurrection when a person dies and man feels that's the end of the matter many times we construct monuments we construct markers something to be remembered by but a lot of people they strive for a legacy in other words and they say well what's his legacy he what's his legacy a legacy is a longlasting impact after someone's passed away so it's what things do they do in life that causes changes in the future that's what they call a legacy presidents they try to do things that they'll leave a legacy something that they did in their Administration their time as president that affected the lives of people for years to come and that's all that men could hope for is a Legacy is something to be remembered by some effect that they had but Jesus's Legacy is not a legacy of remembrance it's not a legacy of remembering what that he did he did this he did this all the stories we read all the healings that we could go through we could sit back and say Jesus healed the blind Jesus healed the sick Jesus raised the dead praise the Lord for all the things that he did he did this he did that and and we would be talking about about his memory and all that he did and we could worship him for all that he did right and he deserves to be praised for all that he did there's never been a man among us like that but yet he himself said I go to the father and I'll send another comforter I'll send the power of the Resurrection that the works that I do you can do also even greater more Works than this will be done than I was able to do here because I'm leaving you a legacy and my legacy is not what I did but it's what I'm going to do through you you are the Legacy the impact the long lasting results of the Resurrection is you the life of Resurrection living in you you are showing the impact and the results of the Resurrection are present tense in you now that that you possess that power you have that quickening and because you have that quickening you can live by it and you can do the things that he done whether it's go the extra mile to give your coat to to feed the hungry visit the Widow and their afflictions all the things that we could list the good works and and the thing but even greater than that it's the ability and the power that God has given you to change circumstances you have a friend that's in bondage they're dead do you know that you have something that changes change that you can make a difference in that day at Calvary the messenger of this age William brandham told his church because his message was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers was to once again remind the church that the power of the Resurrection ction lives in them that they now can do and change people's lives they can confront circumstances that people are absolutely helpless in there they can't help themselves the death of sin has wrapped its bondage around them and they have no way to become free but you are carrying something if it means anything to you if you're living for it why don't we live by it you can come in contact and speak the words of life and make a difference if you are in bondage to morning or you've been burdened with something all your life you lived maybe a several months or uh at a time and then the sin would so easily beset you comes on you again and you find you seem like you're finding yourself back in the same old place the same old M mind battle you got to know what it is that gives you the Victory and it's the power of the Resurrection that I might know him in the power of the Resurrection not that I might know him by history not that I might know him by works but I might come to know him and have fellowship with him in the power that brought me life and the power that brought me Deliverance in the power that brought me freedom in the power that took away the sin that so easily beset me that I might know him in this power that's what we're celebrating we're celebrating the church's God's gift to the church that they too can become possessors of resurrection power and that they too can use this power to carry on the impact and the existence and the longterm effect of what that it was that he's done so I say this morning let's live by the power of the Resurrection I don't care what it is I give it we could have applied circumstances to every single one of these stories but it didn't matter what the circumstances was cuz the power of the Resurrection doesn't deal with circumstance it deals with Victory and life Resurrection means to bring back to life to bring the drug addict back to life to bring the alcoholic back to life to bring the adulterer back to life to take people in the conditions that they're in and bring them back to life that was God's Gift not only will it Quicken your mortal body but it'll have the legacy of living that Christ in me living in me is the hope of
