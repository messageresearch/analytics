[14:30] aren't you glad you know the master amen
[14:33] brother matthew if we could just come

[14:36] certainly glad to be gathered back in
[14:39] the house of god
[14:40] to hear the word of god and to be
[14:42] changed and transformed by it
[14:44] amen
[14:49] lord jesus we just come to you once
[14:52] again lord thankful
[14:54] for the resurrection life that you've
[14:56] sent back upon your believer
[14:58] lord we're thankful that our easter is
[15:01] here
[15:02] to know that you're the same yesterday
[15:04] today and forever lord that you're
[15:06] risen and alive and living in your
[15:08] people
[15:09] lord that's what easter proved is that
[15:12] you did everything that you said you
[15:13] would do lord you said that you tear
[15:15] down this body and in three days i'll
[15:17] raise it up lord
[15:18] and you said that you'd send your
[15:19] comforter back that you wouldn't leave
[15:21] us comfortless lord
[15:22] we're so thankful o god that you sent
[15:26] your holy spirit that we'd have the
[15:27] potentials the resurrected life inside
[15:29] of us lord that's
[15:31] why we've gathered here this evening
[15:33] lord is because it's
[15:34] it's not what we've done but it's all
[15:36] what you have done lord if it was left
[15:38] up to us
[15:39] we'd be out there in the world we'd be
[15:40] lost in sin
[15:42] many of us wouldn't even be alive lord
[15:44] but you are looking out over your seed
[15:46] you are watching over us
[15:47] you are keeping us lord because you had
[15:50] a predestinated plan
[15:51] for our life lord and we're just here to
[15:54] surrender to that lord
[15:55] we're here to surrender our thoughts and
[15:57] our ideas lord
[15:58] knowing that you have a plan to come by
[16:01] once again this evening and speak words
[16:03] of life to us lord jesus
[16:05] lord we're hungering and thirsting for
[16:06] righteousness we want more lord that's
[16:08] why we're here
[16:09] we're not here to fulfill a religious
[16:11] obligation lord but we believe
[16:13] that the creator of heavens and earth is
[16:16] here lord and that there's
[16:17] needs that are represented here lord we
[16:19] have questions we need answers lord
[16:21] we need more revelation we believe lord
[16:23] that by the preaching of the word
[16:25] these things will break and unfold to us
[16:27] lord so may we just purpose in our heart
[16:30] right now to have
[16:31] an expectation for the supernatural may
[16:33] we have an expectation
[16:35] for your word to be manifested that the
[16:37] man of god would be moved out of the way
[16:39] lord and there would just be such a
[16:40] supernatural word go forth
[16:42] that would lift us into higher heights
[16:44] and deeper depths in you lord
[16:46] that we would all be able to say in our
[16:48] hearts wasn't it good
[16:49] to go into the house of the lord we just
[16:52] love you lord we commit the believers to
[16:53] you those that couldn't make it
[16:55] from the musicians lord all the way to
[16:57] those in the back those that are
[16:59] streaming lord
[17:00] we just commit all things to to you
[17:02] knowing that you're faithful lord
[17:03] we have great expectation in our hearts
[17:06] for what you're going to do and say
[17:07] tonight
[17:08] we love you we pray for the man of god
[17:09] we commit them to you in jesus christ's

[30:50] [Music]
[30:58] and strong
[31:01] it's shot forever

[33:14] [Music]
[33:22] just
[33:31] amen aren't you glad for the love of god
[33:34] amen
[33:35] we'll never comprehend fully what that
[33:37] means
[33:39] amen when we were in sins and didn't
[33:42] want anything to do with him
[33:44] and then we stumble and fall and thought
[33:46] that was either and
[33:48] wanted to go back that love was still
[33:50] there just
[33:51] amen are we thankful for it amen we
[33:54] don't have any written requests up here
[33:56] i want to continue to remember sister
[33:58] karen and sister heidi
[34:00] and then the needs represented in the
[34:02] body and if you have any upon your heart
[34:04] just leave your hand up to him
[34:06] amen brother randy if you could just
[34:10] come and take this before the lord and
[34:12] sing as a special amen
[34:17] i believe in equal opportunities
[34:20] i think when we come to church we have
[34:22] to come with a song and
[34:24] you know i know when i look in the
[34:25] audience some people just just talking
[34:28] i don't believe you should just come and
[34:30] sit and think oh you know i'm exempt
[34:32] nobody examined amen
[34:34] i believe we're in the presence of god
[34:36] and we can worship him amen
[34:42] amen let's power heads gracious heavenly
[34:45] father lord jesus
[34:47] we just counted an honor and a privilege
[34:48] lord to know that
[34:52] lord is beyond our comprehension father
[34:54] and i believe your prophet even told us
[34:55] that
[34:56] lord we would spend all eternity with
[34:59] you unfolding yourself to us the
[35:01] the depth and the riches of your love
[35:03] father that these mortal minds could
[35:04] never comprehend father but there's a
[35:07] there's a pull in our hearts oh god a
[35:09] seed that you planted there before the
[35:11] foundation of the world that could
[35:12] recognize
[35:14] lord and to know that we could come
[35:16] before you sinless and spotless lord
[35:17] because we've been
[35:19] cleansed by the blood of your son the
[35:20] lord jesus christ
[35:22] and lord as we bring the needs before
[35:23] the church lord we know that they're
[35:25] already answered even now but father
[35:27] we just plead the blood lord for the
[35:29] ones that need healing lord ones that
[35:31] need salvation father ones that need
[35:33] deliverance lord
[35:34] lord we're a needy people oh god but
[35:36] you're a god that meets
[35:38] each one of us right where we're at
[35:40] father lord it's such a paradox lord
[35:42] that a
[35:43] a message could go forth lord from the
[35:45] pulpit and could
[35:46] be to one person one thing and yet to
[35:48] another one
[35:49] something totally different father but
[35:51] it's because your word is eternal father
[35:53] and meets us right
[35:54] where we have our needs lord we just
[35:56] pray that you would go forth in power
[35:58] and demonstration of your spirit lord
[36:00] that you do it once again father to me
[36:02] your people right where they are lord
[36:04] may you just
[36:05] bless the tithes and offerings lord god
[36:07] as we've given just a little bit of
[36:09] ourselves lord our time
[36:11] lord our natural things that you've
[36:13] given to us lord that we can give back
[36:15] it's just our it's our duty to do that
[36:17] father and we do it with a
[36:19] cheerful heart father you said you love
[36:20] a cheerful giver lord and
[36:22] we want to give not only our tithes and
[36:25] offerings lord but even our time and our
[36:26] praises and our worship with cheerful
[36:28] hearts oh god to
[36:30] lord with sing with revelation to sing
[36:32] with understanding lord not just because
[36:34] it's a form
[36:35] but lord god knowing even if we couldn't
[36:37] explain it with mortal lips lord of
[36:39] revelation
[36:40] in our heart that would reach out to you
[36:41] oh god to hear that eagles cry that
[36:44] eagle scream lord and know that we're
[36:45] represented there
[36:47] lord just ask that you'd be with us in
[36:48] the remainder of the service now
[36:50] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[36:55] is it all right if i just grab this one
[36:56] i guess amen god bless you i
[36:58] i certainly know that every time i come
[37:00] in if i catch brother billy's eye
[37:02] and and even brother matthew and
[37:04] different ones i
[37:06] lord uh just has it on my heart usually
[37:09] i'm already flipping through the mental
[37:10] songbook when i step through the doors
[37:12] sometimes so
[37:13] if i were to sing a song by his grace i
[37:15] trust it's a blessing to you
[37:20] i guess i'll just start and we'll just
[37:22] try to hit the key by the grace of god
[37:23] so
[37:26] some days track
[37:29] some days fly

[50:02] gives us the strength to overcome
[50:05] it gives us peace that surpass
[50:08] understanding and
[50:09] joy that's unspeakable father
[50:12] just grant us this time of fellowship
[50:15] tonight we pray
[50:16] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[50:20] amen you have your bibles let's turn to
[50:24] romans 8
[50:25] and
[50:28] and we'd like to read
[50:32] this scripture verse there
[50:38] in the uh
[50:42] of starting with the uh fifth verse and
[50:46] just read a few verses there
[50:49] it says for they that are after
[50:53] the flesh do mind the things of the
[50:56] flesh
[50:58] but they that are after the spirit the
[51:00] things of the spirit
[51:03] for to be carnally minded is death
[51:06] but to be spiritual minded is life and
[51:09] peace
[51:10] because the carnal mind is enmity
[51:13] against god
[51:15] for it is not subject
[51:18] to the law of god neither indeed
[51:22] can be so then they that are
[51:26] in the flesh cannot please
[51:29] god amen amen let's turn over and read
[51:35] one other scripture here found in
[51:39] hebrews and let's starting
[51:43] with the 11th chapter
[51:46] in the first verse and we just want to
[51:49] talk a little bit about this tonight
[51:52] so he said if you're carnal minded you
[51:54] can't please god
[51:56] now we find out but also in this
[51:58] scripture what pleases god
[52:00] now faith is the substance of things
[52:04] hoped for
[52:05] the evidence not seen
[52:11] for by it the elders obtained
[52:14] a good report through faith
[52:17] we understand that the worlds were
[52:20] framed
[52:20] by the word of god so that things
[52:24] which are seen were made of things
[52:27] which do not appear now
[52:30] that's a great scripture right there so
[52:34] we're going to hold that in our thought
[52:36] there that
[52:37] through faith we understand this by
[52:40] faith abel
[52:41] offered unto god a more excellent
[52:44] sacrifice than cain
[52:46] by which he obtained witness that he
[52:49] was righteous
[52:53] god testifying of his gift
[52:56] and by it he being dead
[52:59] yet speaketh by faith enoch
[53:02] was translated that he should not see
[53:05] death and was not found because
[53:09] god had translated him
[53:12] for before his translation he had this
[53:15] testimony
[53:16] that he pleased god but without faith
[53:19] it is impossible to please him for he
[53:23] that
[53:23] cometh to god must believe
[53:27] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[53:30] them
[53:31] that diligently seek him father we just
[53:35] ask you to
[53:36] bless your word to us tonight in your
[53:38] precious name we pray
[53:40] amen amen we just want to maybe see that
[53:42] we just want to talk a little bit
[53:45] about this great faith but
[53:48] you know i i wanted just to
[53:51] bring to our remembrance something that
[53:55] that was so beautiful this morning and i
[53:59] don't know if you're capable of
[54:01] uh back pulling up that paragraph
[54:05] 177 from easter seal
[54:08] and i just got looking at this it caught
[54:10] my attention
[54:12] uh a while back and and as brother
[54:16] branham was preaching
[54:17] and and uh saying the things that he
[54:21] said
[54:22] i i just felt the burden on his heart
[54:25] and i just felt the emotion
[54:27] that he had and the things that he was
[54:29] saying and
[54:30] how how much he was just almost like
[54:32] hurting for the people
[54:34] you know because he knew that this great
[54:36] event
[54:38] was uh going to be upon them very
[54:41] shortly and it it it seemed like
[54:44] they were missing it the importance of
[54:47] really what it was but can you find that
[54:51] paragraph 177 and
[54:54] i i just just the
[54:57] i get enamored and i just
[55:01] marvel even at the sentence structure
[55:05] of how that brother branham says thing
[55:07] but and we want to talk about this faith
[55:10] but
[55:11] so listen to this he says now
[55:14] let me show you
[55:18] he says i don't care
[55:21] if you're dead or whether
[55:24] or where you're at
[55:27] that quickening power never leaves
[55:32] years and years after his death
[55:37] his meat had rotten away and the skim
[55:40] worms had eaten it up
[55:44] but they were packing a dead man
[55:48] one day and throw him in
[55:51] on that bones and there was
[55:55] so much quickening power there until the
[55:58] man
[55:59] come back to life again
[56:02] now i'm gonna add a twist to that
[56:05] that is just my own personal
[56:09] thing for fellowship so that
[56:12] he says that it brought him back to life
[56:15] again
[56:16] hallelujah raised him up from the dead
[56:20] because that quickening power that was
[56:22] upon
[56:23] that saint of god never left him
[56:27] stayed right on those bones
[56:31] oh remember we are flesh of his flesh
[56:36] and bone of his bone
[56:39] if we are his bride so that quickening
[56:43] power
[56:44] not only was it predestinated to us but
[56:46] it will never leave us
[56:48] death won't bother that quickening power
[56:51] at
[56:52] all though the spin worms destroy this
[56:55] body
[56:56] yet in my flesh shall i see god
[57:00] glory to god what uh
[57:03] now listen to this next statement i
[57:06] don't
[57:07] know what i say
[57:11] what a hope for an old man
[57:15] like me knowing i see
[57:19] my end time right out yonder
[57:23] soon as 56
[57:27] years old i just think that
[57:31] the statement's astounding to me
[57:34] i don't know what i'm saying but he was
[57:37] so
[57:37] confident in that quickening power
[57:40] and we know he died at 56 years old
[57:44] we know that he said that this was that
[57:48] this could be my very last easter
[57:52] and it was he said i know of that i have
[57:54] great trials
[57:55] and troubles out ahead of me
[57:58] but i just thought that how
[58:02] beautiful it is that
[58:05] that quickening power is still upon
[58:09] the word of god today amen
[58:12] that that's what makes it so beautiful
[58:15] and so
[58:16] i went back over and uh over to
[58:19] the paragraphs on 34 2
[58:23] 27 the prophet of god makes this
[58:27] wonderful statement he said i
[58:29] i stood there and looked over that time
[58:35] i stood there and looked over that time
[58:39] so he's in a time somewhere and he's
[58:42] looking over it
[58:44] and i seen tens of thousands times
[58:47] thousands coming young men and women
[58:49] running
[58:50] throwing their arms around me screaming
[58:53] and i looked
[58:54] right back and seen myself lying on the
[58:56] bed
[58:57] oh lord let me look past the curtain of
[59:01] time
[59:02] what is it
[59:05] what is it it's the quickening power
[59:10] that will catch us away that
[59:13] great quickening power the quickening
[59:16] power come
[59:18] in this last day
[59:22] that's the power that's going to catch
[59:25] us away
[59:26] is the quickening power that comes in
[59:29] this last
[59:30] day and he goes on
[59:34] he says i saw he says
[59:38] okay in this last days that's what i'm
[59:41] in arizona for
[59:42] right now there's many people sitting
[59:45] right here
[59:46] stood right here at phoenix and heard me
[59:48] tell you
[59:49] from this very platform thus saith the
[59:52] lord
[59:53] how many remembers it now go
[59:56] something is fixing to happen i saw
[1:00:00] seven angels come
[1:00:02] didn't life magazine pack it as the fog
[1:00:06] of it floated across here 27 miles high
[1:00:11] and 30 miles across is not fred sofman
[1:00:15] and these others gene mormons sitting
[1:00:18] back there
[1:00:19] stood right there when them seven angels
[1:00:21] appeared
[1:00:22] right here on the hill it shook the
[1:00:25] hills for miles around like that
[1:00:28] there stood seven angels and throwed a
[1:00:31] sword
[1:00:32] in your hand saying go home
[1:00:35] and open these seven seals
[1:00:38] that are given and here
[1:00:42] they are the true mystery of marriage
[1:00:45] and divorce
[1:00:46] and the serpent see in all these things
[1:00:50] that's been fussed about it's thus saith
[1:00:53] the lord
[1:00:54] what is it the quickening power
[1:00:57] coming to the church making her ready
[1:01:02] this hour that we're approaching
[1:01:05] quickening power now i want to just
[1:01:09] just talk about the simplicity
[1:01:13] of faith and if what
[1:01:16] faith means to us
[1:01:19] and so in the next paragraph he makes
[1:01:22] this statement you see
[1:01:23] see it depends on what attitude you take
[1:01:26] to it
[1:01:27] whether it's going to do you any good or
[1:01:30] not
[1:01:32] so just think about that there's a
[1:01:34] there's there's a
[1:01:36] part of it that we play that whether
[1:01:39] it's going to do any good or not so he
[1:01:42] says
[1:01:43] this the the beyond the curtain of time
[1:01:46] the seven angels coming
[1:01:48] this great uh deliverance of marriage
[1:01:51] and divorce
[1:01:52] serpent seed all these things that have
[1:01:54] come to pass he says
[1:01:55] it's the quickening power
[1:01:58] that's coming to the church to make her
[1:02:01] ready
[1:02:03] but it depends on what attitude you take
[1:02:06] towards it whether
[1:02:07] it's going to do you any good
[1:02:11] so if you're going to get something out
[1:02:13] of it
[1:02:14] you you know and and i'm i'm kind of
[1:02:17] going through that because you know some
[1:02:18] people are trying to get me to
[1:02:20] work out a little bit you know and uh
[1:02:23] they want me to get like a personal
[1:02:25] trainer
[1:02:26] you know and i know i don't have the
[1:02:28] right attitude towards that personal
[1:02:30] trainer
[1:02:32] you know what i mean until i i would i i
[1:02:35] he wouldn't do me any good you you know
[1:02:38] what i'm saying and
[1:02:40] and so you you begin to look at oh god
[1:02:43] help us to receive it help us to
[1:02:46] believe it help us to have faith in it
[1:02:51] okay you know i mean so
[1:02:54] it was sent to do something the opening
[1:02:58] of the seals the revealing of serpenty
[1:03:00] the preaching of marriage and divorce
[1:03:03] all the sermon titles we could bring
[1:03:05] them off it was sent
[1:03:06] to do something you understand it wasn't
[1:03:10] it wasn't sent to be a theological
[1:03:14] exercise in correcting false doctrine
[1:03:17] but it was it was sent to do something
[1:03:20] more than that
[1:03:21] it was sent to get me ready as he said
[1:03:25] earlier in the message
[1:03:27] it's sent to bring us into rapturing
[1:03:30] conditions
[1:03:31] so when you begin to approach something
[1:03:33] different
[1:03:34] then your approach basically is
[1:03:37] expressed
[1:03:38] in your expectations what am i expecting
[1:03:41] this message to do it's not here that i
[1:03:45] can sit back
[1:03:46] and look on it and examine it and say
[1:03:49] this is true this is true
[1:03:51] the godhead's true the teachings are
[1:03:53] true and that's true
[1:03:55] nothing against that because it is true
[1:03:58] scripturally it's true
[1:04:00] but but do do we approach it in such a
[1:04:03] manner
[1:04:03] that we have an expectation
[1:04:07] of what that it's going to do to me
[1:04:10] so it's going to do something to david
[1:04:12] mcderry it's going to
[1:04:14] perform a work on me it's going to
[1:04:16] there's going to be a transformation
[1:04:18] that takes place
[1:04:20] now do do i look at it that way do i
[1:04:23] approach it that way
[1:04:24] because he says it depends on your
[1:04:26] approach to it
[1:04:27] whether or not it's going to do you any
[1:04:29] good well what's the
[1:04:31] good that it's supposed to do
[1:04:36] that's what i know what's the good of it
[1:04:39] it does
[1:04:40] do me one bit of good to say the baptist
[1:04:42] doesn't have
[1:04:43] the godhead right
[1:04:48] or the pope's the antichrist which is
[1:04:51] all true
[1:04:53] it's amenable word
[1:04:58] but that's not what we're after we're
[1:04:59] not after a mental word
[1:05:02] something that we can all amen something
[1:05:04] that we can all get on board with
[1:05:07] something that we can form a fellowship
[1:05:09] around that
[1:05:10] that we can say well we're it we're in
[1:05:14] we're the bride where we can put
[1:05:15] accolades
[1:05:17] on ourselves and make claims you want to
[1:05:19] know something we're the bride but none
[1:05:21] of us
[1:05:22] know who is in that group but him
[1:05:26] there's going to be a lot of people
[1:05:27] there that surprise you
[1:05:29] what are you doing here i already sent
[1:05:32] you to hell years ago
[1:05:38] you know what i mean you don't approach
[1:05:40] anybody on what they believe
[1:05:42] you approach people because the love of
[1:05:45] god is shed abroad in your heart
[1:05:47] by the holy spirit you love people
[1:05:49] regardless
[1:05:50] what you receive you receive by
[1:05:52] revelation
[1:05:53] so why should you judge something for
[1:05:55] something that they don't have
[1:06:00] so if it's not trying to form a
[1:06:04] universal comfort zone i like hanging
[1:06:07] around with these people because they
[1:06:09] speak the way i speak they talk the way
[1:06:11] i talk
[1:06:12] you know they're in the same groove i'm
[1:06:14] in and i take comfort in that
[1:06:16] no it comes back to a place of faith
[1:06:21] another faith says there's an evidence
[1:06:24] in this message okay and i want
[1:06:28] that evidence to become substance
[1:06:31] in me and this message sent that it was
[1:06:35] sent to get me ready so now i'm asking
[1:06:39] myself is this message this opening of
[1:06:42] the seals
[1:06:43] all that came in the prophet of god's
[1:06:45] message all that he was speaking about
[1:06:48] he said it's the quickening power coming
[1:06:51] to the church
[1:06:52] to make it ready that's what the opening
[1:06:55] of the seals was he said those seven
[1:06:57] angels
[1:06:58] what is it it's the quickening power
[1:07:00] coming to the church
[1:07:02] making her ready this hour
[1:07:05] that we're approaching quickening power
[1:07:09] now i wonder what what am i believing
[1:07:12] for
[1:07:15] so am i believing the carnal connection
[1:07:20] or am i believing the spiritual
[1:07:26] connection because this
[1:07:28] message is true carnally
[1:07:33] i don't care what anybody wants to argue
[1:07:35] whether what it is or what it's not
[1:07:37] but that picture was taken
[1:07:43] it can be disputed let them dispute it
[1:07:48] it won't do them any good
[1:07:53] and and so he we agree with that so
[1:07:56] see it depends on the attitude you take
[1:07:58] whether
[1:08:00] it'll do you do you any good or not
[1:08:02] though
[1:08:03] you have to believe that you don't
[1:08:06] believe it
[1:08:07] it won't do you one bit of good
[1:08:11] and that he goes talking about this and
[1:08:13] i thought this statement
[1:08:15] is where i'm kind of going he said do
[1:08:18] you know
[1:08:18] he said why why could jesus say the
[1:08:21] paragraph
[1:08:23] 2 38 why could jesus say that
[1:08:27] i want to ask you why could jesus say a
[1:08:31] thing like that
[1:08:32] he knew that he was amen
[1:08:36] i wish i could make that stick you
[1:08:38] remember how he said it
[1:08:40] he was almost in pleading this morning
[1:08:45] he knew who he was he knew that every
[1:08:48] word
[1:08:49] god had wrote in there of him
[1:08:53] had to be fulfilled he knew that he was
[1:08:56] the one david spoke of
[1:08:58] now this scripture struck me this
[1:09:00] quotation
[1:09:02] do you know that you're the ones the
[1:09:04] bible speaks of
[1:09:07] amen do you know your
[1:09:11] position is in
[1:09:14] christ not what your position
[1:09:17] in christ but your position
[1:09:20] is in the anointing the anointed one
[1:09:25] if you're in christ you're a new
[1:09:28] creature
[1:09:29] do you know this word is
[1:09:33] just like every day
[1:09:36] living to you why
[1:09:40] sure it's yours you're
[1:09:43] you're an eagle and that's your
[1:09:46] food and and so
[1:09:52] you know i think with our messenger
[1:09:55] facing
[1:09:56] what obviously lied before him
[1:10:00] his faith believed
[1:10:04] that what was promised was going to come
[1:10:08] it to pass in him
[1:10:11] and so we know that what
[1:10:15] faith is that faith is the
[1:10:18] connection between the supernatural
[1:10:23] and the natural it's the connection
[1:10:27] and you know any of us that's ever
[1:10:29] worked on more
[1:10:30] motors or worked on machinery or
[1:10:33] worked on anything we know that there's
[1:10:36] two
[1:10:36] substances to it and one's called
[1:10:39] the line and that's the power
[1:10:44] and the others the load
[1:10:47] and that's what's receiving the power
[1:10:51] to do what it's made
[1:10:55] to do so you have
[1:10:58] your you have your power that comes in
[1:11:02] and you have some means of disconnect
[1:11:07] that that keeps the the power
[1:11:11] and the load or running or the machine
[1:11:15] running or the vacuum cleaner running
[1:11:19] or the uh blender
[1:11:23] or the instapot guys talking
[1:11:27] in skill saws and all those
[1:11:31] different things but you understand that
[1:11:34] there's a power
[1:11:36] and that's the supernatural you know
[1:11:39] they've never
[1:11:40] really ever been able to come up
[1:11:44] with a definitive definition
[1:11:48] of electricity
[1:11:53] they know what they do to get it
[1:11:56] but to totally understand uh
[1:12:00] uh what it is
[1:12:03] exactly men's has never been able to
[1:12:06] come up with a definitive
[1:12:08] they know it's ions and protons and
[1:12:11] neutrons and
[1:12:13] all that stuff going on but it's it
[1:12:16] it's almost something that you can't see
[1:12:20] you know you can see the results of
[1:12:22] electricity
[1:12:24] brother tim have you ever felt the
[1:12:26] results of electricity
[1:12:28] yeah i know what it's like to be on the
[1:12:31] end of 277.
[1:12:34] you know you know i've had my hand
[1:12:36] vibrate until it's bruised
[1:12:39] you know but you can't see it it's there
[1:12:43] but you can't see it you can test it to
[1:12:46] know that it's there
[1:12:48] well so if we looked at electricity like
[1:12:51] like the great uh uh
[1:12:54] uh supernatural there's something that
[1:12:58] is a disconnect yes that that you're a
[1:13:01] that you're the power sits right here
[1:13:05] and and here's the here's the cause
[1:13:08] the purpose so you've got an engine or
[1:13:10] something that runs here
[1:13:12] and and you've got this power here well
[1:13:14] there's something right here that
[1:13:16] connects this power to this piece of
[1:13:19] machinery
[1:13:21] to make it run and do what it was
[1:13:24] designed to do and we're
[1:13:28] created to do something and there's a
[1:13:31] power
[1:13:32] there that can make us perform
[1:13:36] what that we're uh called to perform
[1:13:40] but but the the connection
[1:13:43] of those two is faith
[1:13:47] that that's the connection that's the
[1:13:50] disconnect
[1:13:52] so it can tell that something and
[1:13:54] anybody that's worked around these
[1:13:56] things
[1:13:57] knows that if if you uh
[1:14:00] put that disconnect on with a full load
[1:14:04] that you're gonna you're gonna get a uh
[1:14:08] sparks you're gonna get something that
[1:14:11] stands out you know and
[1:14:14] and you know it too maybe some of you
[1:14:16] that have had your
[1:14:17] vacuum cleaner on or something and you
[1:14:19] go to stick your plug in and it's on
[1:14:22] you see those little sparks that that
[1:14:24] that happen there
[1:14:26] you know a lot of times i've seen people
[1:14:28] and they see those little sparks they
[1:14:29] pull out they jump
[1:14:30] it's almost the fear that keeps them
[1:14:33] from making the connection
[1:14:37] you understand so in other words they
[1:14:39] they don't want that connection they
[1:14:41] don't want to throw that disconnect on
[1:14:44] and pull that power but that's what
[1:14:46] faith is
[1:14:47] faith is that is the disconnect it's the
[1:14:50] connection
[1:14:51] between the supernatural to the natural
[1:14:54] how does the supernatural get into our
[1:14:58] natural lives
[1:15:00] by faith
[1:15:04] by faith that's what that's what
[1:15:07] it happens it's by faith that it does
[1:15:10] those things and i thought that
[1:15:12] as he said even in here and he was
[1:15:16] talking about by faith he said here by
[1:15:19] faith noah being warned of god of things
[1:15:25] not seen as of yet
[1:15:31] okay so he didn't see it
[1:15:35] so there's a supernatural that's up here
[1:15:39] and it's it's going to be rain
[1:15:42] because it's never been seen before it's
[1:15:45] it's
[1:15:45] it's going so therefore rain is going to
[1:15:47] be something that's
[1:15:48] supernatural and there's got to be
[1:15:51] something that
[1:15:52] that that connects that supernatural
[1:15:57] to the natural so there had to be
[1:15:59] something
[1:16:00] that connected the word
[1:16:04] that it was going to reign with noah
[1:16:09] and what that connection is is what
[1:16:12] connected that
[1:16:14] to noah was his faith
[1:16:17] that he had faith he heard it he
[1:16:19] believed it
[1:16:22] and and so it said by faith
[1:16:25] not seeing moved with fear prepared an
[1:16:29] ark i wrote my note who noah's faith was
[1:16:34] that connection that there was rain
[1:16:37] coming
[1:16:38] so much that he built the first cruise
[1:16:41] ship
[1:16:44] that's what he did
[1:16:50] by faith he was he was so
[1:16:53] up moved with fear
[1:16:57] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:16:59] house
[1:17:00] by the which he condemned the world
[1:17:05] and became heir of righteousness
[1:17:08] which is by faith
[1:17:12] you you look at abraham
[1:17:15] you know abraham by faith
[1:17:19] abraham believed the supernatural
[1:17:23] right and so by by faith
[1:17:27] abraham believed that god promised
[1:17:29] something that god was able to perform
[1:17:32] that which was to come if abraham would
[1:17:35] have turned it down
[1:17:38] right if he wouldn't have pulled the
[1:17:40] disconnect
[1:17:41] if i could say or or through the switch
[1:17:44] on
[1:17:45] to let that power come down
[1:17:48] and work in his life to transform him
[1:17:55] so here comes melchizedek melchizedek
[1:17:59] appears before abraham
[1:18:01] and and tells abraham that he's going to
[1:18:04] have a son and and
[1:18:08] sarah laughs and he discerns
[1:18:12] that and they're sitting in front of
[1:18:14] abraham
[1:18:15] abraham's looking at and we saw this
[1:18:18] great mystery in who is this malteser
[1:18:21] that
[1:18:23] abe melchizedek was showing abraham
[1:18:26] what every son of god
[1:18:29] would become he would become that
[1:18:32] that supernatural
[1:18:36] being without death or without days
[1:18:40] not only was he showing abraham
[1:18:43] what everyone would become he was
[1:18:45] showing abraham
[1:18:47] how that he was going to bring the
[1:18:49] promise to pass
[1:18:54] abraham this promise is going to come to
[1:18:57] pass
[1:18:58] because i'm going to make you young
[1:19:03] but because he believed it it allowed
[1:19:07] the supernatural
[1:19:09] to come in and perform
[1:19:14] what that his purpose was
[1:19:19] that his seed would become like the
[1:19:22] stars
[1:19:24] that man would be redeemed in his seed
[1:19:28] you've got to see we you can you can't
[1:19:30] you you've got to
[1:19:32] understand that the thing that connects
[1:19:35] the supernatural
[1:19:37] with the natural is faith
[1:19:40] and without it it's impossible to please
[1:19:43] god
[1:19:46] and i i thought when i was reading this
[1:19:50] little
[1:19:52] message and it it it struck
[1:19:55] out to me and i'd like to read the
[1:19:57] statement to you
[1:19:58] it was found in the influence of another
[1:20:04] and so the prophet of god's talking
[1:20:06] about the woman at the well
[1:20:12] he he came to the woman at the well
[1:20:15] and he said look at the woman
[1:20:18] at the well when she saw something
[1:20:22] happen
[1:20:23] brother she had two wings
[1:20:26] she got away with them
[1:20:29] right quick she come out there
[1:20:34] jacob's well to get some of that
[1:20:37] contaminated water
[1:20:39] that they was arguing about but when she
[1:20:42] got a drink
[1:20:43] out of the fountain of life she went
[1:20:47] into action
[1:20:48] right quick now this is what
[1:20:52] i just stood out in my heart she didn't
[1:20:55] say
[1:20:56] sir please tell me where you got
[1:21:00] your education
[1:21:04] where did you get this stuff at
[1:21:08] i've had people ask me that where did
[1:21:11] you get this
[1:21:12] at how did you learn it
[1:21:17] or how did you know that i had five
[1:21:20] husbands
[1:21:21] how did you know what was wrong with me
[1:21:25] how did you know i was a woman of
[1:21:27] samaria
[1:21:28] how do you know these things see she
[1:21:31] never
[1:21:32] asked for a carnal connection
[1:21:41] she didn't ask for a carnal
[1:21:44] explanation of how this was going to
[1:21:47] happen
[1:21:48] or how did you know this or how did it
[1:21:52] do it and i'm saying this for a reason
[1:21:55] because you know that they're they're
[1:21:58] they're raised up
[1:21:59] critics in this message
[1:22:03] and and and now they've gone
[1:22:06] beyond just their little things but
[1:22:09] they're holding
[1:22:10] anti-message conventions
[1:22:13] they're going overseas now and all their
[1:22:16] old missionary contacts
[1:22:18] and everything and they're they're
[1:22:20] trying to
[1:22:21] explain and explain see what they can't
[1:22:24] find is they can't find a carnal
[1:22:29] connection but it isn't the carnal
[1:22:32] because the carnal mind
[1:22:34] cannot connect with the supernatural
[1:22:38] faith is the connection that brings the
[1:22:41] supernatural
[1:22:44] so if you have faith it can be
[1:22:48] unexplainable noah believed something
[1:22:52] that had not been
[1:22:54] seen yet it wasn't known by the
[1:22:57] carnality
[1:22:59] so natural things are understood by
[1:23:01] natural minds
[1:23:03] the carnal mind understands natural
[1:23:05] things it understands things by
[1:23:08] by by natural things like like
[1:23:11] sight and smell
[1:23:14] and hearing and touch and taste
[1:23:18] it understands things
[1:23:21] by carnal natural things
[1:23:26] or it does the intellect or or emotions
[1:23:30] in intellect and reasoning and all those
[1:23:32] things
[1:23:33] those are all carnal connections
[1:23:36] and when someone doesn't have faith
[1:23:40] and they can't connect with the
[1:23:42] supernatural
[1:23:43] they have no way of bringing the
[1:23:46] supernatural
[1:23:47] into the natural because the
[1:23:50] supernatural
[1:23:51] only comes through the disconnect
[1:23:54] of faith so if you don't have faith
[1:23:58] you're disconnected
[1:24:03] you'll never find a carnal explanation
[1:24:06] for something that's spiritual he'll
[1:24:09] never
[1:24:10] understand something that has not yet
[1:24:12] been seen
[1:24:16] but faith is the
[1:24:20] connect and faith is a gift of god
[1:24:24] lest any man should boast
[1:24:30] it's what it's what connects it
[1:24:33] and when faith connects it
[1:24:37] then the supernatural comes
[1:24:40] into the natural and performs
[1:24:43] the promise that was believed
[1:24:48] but so many times we look
[1:24:52] for a carnal connect
[1:24:57] wait a minute there's got to be a reason
[1:25:01] they went so as far as saying well this
[1:25:03] is telepathy
[1:25:06] why if telepathy he could do that
[1:25:09] praise god what could god do
[1:25:16] you understand so you know a lot of
[1:25:19] times
[1:25:20] we battle because that's what satan
[1:25:23] always wants to present is there's got
[1:25:27] to be
[1:25:28] some carnal connection
[1:25:32] but the carnal the supernatural doesn't
[1:25:35] connect to the carnal
[1:25:37] on its own there's only one device
[1:25:42] that it goes through
[1:25:45] and in our code jay says there's only
[1:25:48] one device per every promise
[1:25:51] and that's faith
[1:25:55] you can't put more in one device on the
[1:25:57] circuit we've got one device
[1:25:59] that enters the supernatural into the
[1:26:03] natural world
[1:26:04] and that's faith faith the only thing
[1:26:07] that when you hear the promise
[1:26:11] and faith connects to that promise it
[1:26:14] doesn't ask
[1:26:15] when it doesn't ask why it doesn't have
[1:26:18] time
[1:26:18] it doesn't need a carnal time frame it
[1:26:22] doesn't need any reasoning it doesn't
[1:26:24] need a weather report
[1:26:26] it doesn't need anything alls it knows
[1:26:29] it's connected to the power
[1:26:32] can that it's going to happen
[1:26:36] because that's what faith is it's the
[1:26:39] connection
[1:26:41] god planned it that way and that's what
[1:26:44] every day
[1:26:45] abraham was asked to believe
[1:26:48] that he was going to add well faith
[1:26:52] believed it and so
[1:26:55] faith has got characteristics
[1:27:01] and and there there are certain things
[1:27:04] that
[1:27:06] that create the
[1:27:09] atmosphere if i can say this
[1:27:12] that allows the supernatural
[1:27:15] to connect with the natural
[1:27:20] so if i could say that with so
[1:27:23] when we have a a a disconnect or
[1:27:28] a starter or whatever these are
[1:27:32] in machinery those things are rated
[1:27:37] your switch is on the wall for
[1:27:39] electricians they're going to carry
[1:27:41] so much power they have a rating
[1:27:46] and if the load is greater than the
[1:27:49] faith
[1:27:51] it'll burn up
[1:27:56] you don't understand so you've got to
[1:27:58] connect
[1:28:01] and that connected connection
[1:28:04] has to be rated and so there's
[1:28:08] characteristics of the rating of faith
[1:28:14] you understand the power doesn't fail
[1:28:18] it's the device that fails
[1:28:23] the power burns up the device
[1:28:28] and all of a sudden the device is gone
[1:28:31] or the faith is gone
[1:28:33] there's no more power coming to
[1:28:36] the the instrument to have it
[1:28:39] do what it's performed and created to
[1:28:43] perform
[1:28:44] and can these and this is in this
[1:28:47] message
[1:28:47] the influence another he says what the
[1:28:50] church needs tonight
[1:28:51] first is to be reverent
[1:28:55] so you're going to talk about this faith
[1:28:59] it's another it's got to be reverent
[1:29:02] and there's it's got to understand
[1:29:05] the austerity and the wonderfulness
[1:29:09] and the perfection of god even being
[1:29:12] ma mindful of man what is man
[1:29:16] that god is even mindful of them
[1:29:19] can there just got to have a respect to
[1:29:22] what's happening
[1:29:24] the worst thing i've ever seen when i
[1:29:26] was an electrical contractor
[1:29:28] is having kids that come on the job that
[1:29:31] don't have respect for electricity
[1:29:38] i had a guy take a wiggins how many
[1:29:41] knows what a wiggins is
[1:29:44] all right a few of you do it's a device
[1:29:48] that tests how much electricity is there
[1:29:52] can this guy took this wiggins i you
[1:29:56] could tell it's brand new you know he
[1:29:57] had that brand new leather
[1:29:59] uh pouch there you know what i mean with
[1:30:02] that
[1:30:03] little prongs hanging out and you know
[1:30:06] his belt was all brand new and his
[1:30:08] two his clients were so
[1:30:12] you know they couldn't even open them up
[1:30:15] you know we always did when we hired
[1:30:17] somebody we asked for their clients
[1:30:20] that's a pair of pliers so give me your
[1:30:23] clients
[1:30:24] and if you couldn't throw them up in the
[1:30:26] air and have them go click click
[1:30:27] click click click click click click
[1:30:29] click click you didn't hire that guy
[1:30:31] because he hadn't used those things
[1:30:33] enough to make them loose
[1:30:38] you know it's just like some guys they
[1:30:40] don't they they don't look at you what
[1:30:42] you know
[1:30:42] they look at your hands you know if you
[1:30:46] don't have no cuts or no scars or no
[1:30:48] burns you ain't been
[1:30:50] you ain't been in the work business very
[1:30:52] long i mean you just know that
[1:30:55] the guy told me because i said i've
[1:30:57] never been cut i said you ain't been
[1:30:58] working long
[1:31:03] have you ever pinched yourself with a
[1:31:05] pair of dikes
[1:31:09] yeah there's all those things that goes
[1:31:11] with it
[1:31:13] so but so you you sit here and
[1:31:16] and and you you watch this that if it
[1:31:19] doesn't have these characteristics
[1:31:23] you understand so he says if you're not
[1:31:26] in respect if you're not in awe so this
[1:31:30] guy took this
[1:31:31] tester and he's walking over to this
[1:31:34] this cage and there's a panel under
[1:31:38] there
[1:31:38] and there's a big sign that he don't
[1:31:41] understand
[1:31:42] it says danger
[1:31:47] high voltage
[1:31:50] now he's going to take this little
[1:31:52] tester that's
[1:31:54] good for i don't know you might get 480
[1:31:57] maybe out of a wiggins i wouldn't go to
[1:31:59] 880.
[1:32:03] and he was fixing to set that on 7200
[1:32:08] 7200 volts
[1:32:11] i barely got to him in time
[1:32:16] it was so close if i didn't get to him
[1:32:18] in time he would have killed a smoke
[1:32:23] and i looked at this guy i says what
[1:32:26] are you thinking
[1:32:30] you just don't walk into a steel plant
[1:32:35] all these cranes and stuff and walk
[1:32:37] around with your little toy testing
[1:32:40] things
[1:32:41] you almost got us both killed well let
[1:32:44] me tell you
[1:32:47] we kill a lot of people's faith
[1:32:53] or we ruin their device
[1:32:56] their connection to the supernatural
[1:33:00] because we're not reverent
[1:33:06] we don't have a reverence for the
[1:33:08] promise
[1:33:10] we we throw them out there that god's a
[1:33:12] healer
[1:33:13] with without much regard
[1:33:16] to what it took to make him
[1:33:20] a healer and give us the proof
[1:33:24] that his word comes to pass he he took
[1:33:28] he was by his stripes
[1:33:30] that we were healed he paid a price for
[1:33:33] that
[1:33:33] faith could have a place it rested on to
[1:33:36] make connection to the supernatural
[1:33:39] that the supernatural could come down
[1:33:41] into the natural
[1:33:42] and perform the promise
[1:33:48] and when the device fails the connection
[1:33:51] fails
[1:33:54] when the faith fails
[1:33:58] the supernatural has no more
[1:34:02] path to the natural
[1:34:07] it doesn't have a pathway it's been
[1:34:10] interrupted
[1:34:12] if you ever find something a plug that
[1:34:15] doesn't have any power
[1:34:16] you go back there's something that's
[1:34:18] interrupted that
[1:34:20] maybe in a j box maybe someplace else
[1:34:23] some of the
[1:34:24] wire nuts come off or you've lost a
[1:34:26] neutral
[1:34:27] you start going back or you go to a
[1:34:28] contact maybe a contact that fail
[1:34:31] you keep tracing that back to the source
[1:34:34] because if the source is there
[1:34:37] and the div and the instrument
[1:34:40] is there then it's got to be a
[1:34:44] failure in the connection
[1:34:50] and there's only one connection
[1:34:55] to the supernatural and it's faith
[1:34:59] by faith he listed all these people
[1:35:02] by faith by faith i love the movie that
[1:35:06] we watch deep call to the deep
[1:35:08] he stands there can he talk he says you
[1:35:10] know i'm waiting on something
[1:35:12] i can do nothing his faith
[1:35:16] but father you told me you told me i'm
[1:35:20] standing here in front of all these
[1:35:22] congressmen
[1:35:23] the vice president of the united states
[1:35:25] all these people i'm standing here
[1:35:27] because you
[1:35:28] commissioned me you told me to go you
[1:35:30] told me the angel would be there with me
[1:35:33] and by faith his faith was a connection
[1:35:36] to the supernatural
[1:35:38] that allowed the dynamics to come in and
[1:35:41] perform
[1:35:42] the mechanics
[1:35:47] you're not going to take a carnal
[1:35:50] substitute
[1:35:51] even intellect of the history
[1:35:55] of the message
[1:35:59] that's right you can't make a carnal
[1:36:02] connection
[1:36:03] a carnal connection can't take
[1:36:07] the load it'll burn up your device
[1:36:11] you'll find yourself losing your faith
[1:36:14] you'll find that you only have it for a
[1:36:16] season
[1:36:16] or you'll only have it uh
[1:36:20] for a period of time and that's what
[1:36:23] happened
[1:36:23] these guys had a carnal connection
[1:36:26] through relatives
[1:36:29] through experiences of other people
[1:36:32] of everything they had but they never
[1:36:34] had the they never
[1:36:36] possessed the connection themselves to
[1:36:40] the supernatural
[1:36:42] and therefore they couldn't take the
[1:36:44] load
[1:36:48] they had a meltdown
[1:36:52] melted their faith away so all they can
[1:36:55] do to defend themselves
[1:36:57] is say the supernatural ain't true
[1:37:00] the supernatural ain't true
[1:37:04] supernatural supernatural's always been
[1:37:06] there
[1:37:08] the truth of the matter is you just
[1:37:10] don't have
[1:37:11] a device to connect to it
[1:37:15] that's your problem
[1:37:19] and all you're trying to do is justify
[1:37:21] your meltdown
[1:37:25] no respect do you remember this morning
[1:37:29] why that he said that uh
[1:37:33] what was uh jonathan works
[1:37:36] what it was that healed him
[1:37:40] because he had respect for the
[1:37:46] supernatural
[1:37:48] to understand so this device has got to
[1:37:50] have ratings
[1:37:53] for it to be able to take the current
[1:37:57] and bring it to the promise which is the
[1:38:01] machine
[1:38:02] and start the promise up to perform the
[1:38:06] function for which that promise was
[1:38:08] created
[1:38:10] i hope the carnality of my types is
[1:38:13] something
[1:38:14] that you can understand vacuum cleaners
[1:38:17] created a vacuum carpet
[1:38:19] you got a cord and you got a plug
[1:38:22] the plug is what connects you don't have
[1:38:25] the plug you can't connect it
[1:38:27] but if you connect it the vacuum cleaner
[1:38:30] will do what it's created to do
[1:38:32] so there's another characteristic he
[1:38:35] says the next thing be humble
[1:38:42] i thought even in the messi this morning
[1:38:44] he said you know
[1:38:46] he says he said a christian doesn't vote
[1:38:49] because whoa far be it from a christian
[1:38:52] to say i've got this power or i've got
[1:38:55] that
[1:38:56] he said far be it from a christian it's
[1:38:59] it's got to be humble
[1:39:00] you never perform a miracle to prove
[1:39:03] anything
[1:39:05] that's right especially yourself
[1:39:11] did you hear him this morning to say i
[1:39:13] would hate to trust
[1:39:15] in my gifts or my preaching
[1:39:20] or my visions
[1:39:24] that's humility
[1:39:27] he didn't count that to one portion of
[1:39:31] his salvation
[1:39:33] he counted his full salvation to the one
[1:39:36] place that god meets the believer
[1:39:39] and the believer believes that that shed
[1:39:42] blood
[1:39:44] was accepted by the father and he sent
[1:39:47] the supernatural down
[1:39:49] to touch the life of the believer we
[1:39:51] don't we have
[1:39:52] nothing that we bring nothing
[1:39:57] we just accept the fact that he's
[1:40:00] forgiven us
[1:40:01] our sins we place ourselves humbly into
[1:40:04] his hands
[1:40:04] and let us mold us and teach us and
[1:40:07] correct us
[1:40:09] and tutor us to bring us to the place
[1:40:13] that we can receive more power from on
[1:40:20] high
[1:40:22] and then he said he says be humble
[1:40:25] and then the next thing he says is
[1:40:28] you've got to get yourself into action
[1:40:31] so there's things that that are are
[1:40:34] characteristic
[1:40:36] of faith real faith is rated
[1:40:40] real faith has specs
[1:40:44] you know what specs are right
[1:40:45] specifications things that determine
[1:40:49] what that it is it's description
[1:40:52] he says so you got to be you got to be
[1:40:55] reverent
[1:40:55] you got to be humble and you got to be
[1:40:58] willing to act
[1:41:03] you know you got to be willing to act
[1:41:07] if if the power hits the machine and
[1:41:09] it's not willing to act
[1:41:10] that machine's dead it's
[1:41:14] toast you go get another one
[1:41:19] because it's not willing to act
[1:41:24] it's just it's just not willing to go
[1:41:25] into action
[1:41:27] so you can have faith
[1:41:30] without being willing to go into action
[1:41:35] you could faith if faith isn't willing
[1:41:37] to act
[1:41:38] it it it the the current will
[1:41:42] burn it down how many people i've seen
[1:41:45] that have believed something that's
[1:41:47] walked off the platform in prayer
[1:41:49] walked out of a uh discussing the word
[1:41:52] of god
[1:41:53] and and and they have they gonna go do
[1:41:56] something about it
[1:41:59] and they failed to act
[1:42:03] and after a while
[1:42:06] the disconnects unlatched
[1:42:12] it's not connected anymore
[1:42:15] because it didn't have the
[1:42:17] characteristics
[1:42:18] to carry the supernatural to the natural
[1:42:23] and you'll never be able to take the
[1:42:25] supernatural
[1:42:27] and bring it into the natural lives and
[1:42:29] that's what we need we need a lot of
[1:42:32] help in this natural world
[1:42:34] our flesh needs help our mind needs help
[1:42:37] our families need help because the
[1:42:39] world's against us
[1:42:41] they're turning against us we need help
[1:42:44] and the help that we need is that
[1:42:46] quickening power
[1:42:47] that supernatural electricity and is
[1:42:50] only one way to get that supernatural
[1:42:53] electricity into our lives
[1:42:57] to perform what it's going to perform
[1:43:00] and that's faith
[1:43:04] brother doug mccues has gone on to be
[1:43:06] with the lord who's a friend of mine
[1:43:08] he told me he said david brother branham
[1:43:11] sat me down and looked me straight in
[1:43:13] the eye
[1:43:14] and i know a lot of people saw i wish
[1:43:16] he'd have sat down and looked me
[1:43:18] straightened and i don't think i wanted
[1:43:20] him to look me straight in the eye
[1:43:24] because i know there's a lot of things
[1:43:25] in there that i
[1:43:27] just soon stay where they're at
[1:43:34] and he said doug he said you can
[1:43:38] fast to your skin and bones
[1:43:44] and i don't know if this is on tape but
[1:43:46] this is what my friend told me
[1:43:48] and i trust him he said you can fast to
[1:43:52] your skin and bones
[1:43:54] he said you can cry till there's not a
[1:43:58] tear left in your eye you can
[1:44:01] holler until you don't have any voice
[1:44:07] he said he listed some other things
[1:44:10] he says but god will not do anything for
[1:44:14] you
[1:44:14] that he didn't say he would do for you
[1:44:23] and you know what all that other stuff
[1:44:25] is
[1:44:27] that's carnal connection
[1:44:33] it's carnal connection
[1:44:36] we've got for some reason we've got to
[1:44:39] have some
[1:44:40] carnal connection some way that
[1:44:44] we can connect outside of faith
[1:44:49] give me a reason to believe other than
[1:44:53] he said so
[1:44:57] give me some other reason i don't know
[1:45:00] about you
[1:45:01] i've been a christian a few years and
[1:45:04] i've got enough failures
[1:45:07] to know certain things work and certain
[1:45:10] things don't work
[1:45:12] i wish that i was to the place i didn't
[1:45:14] keep trying new things
[1:45:17] but how many times have you made a
[1:45:19] program for god
[1:45:21] to follow if this happens if this
[1:45:24] happens
[1:45:25] or if this comes to pass or if he does
[1:45:28] this
[1:45:33] you know what i mean we just we just
[1:45:35] think if
[1:45:36] if these things could come together
[1:45:41] or i can see how god's going to do it
[1:45:45] and that's fine for encouragement
[1:45:50] you know what i mean i like to be
[1:45:52] encouraged i like some somebody come and
[1:45:53] tell me he says
[1:45:54] well maybe that happened so this could
[1:45:56] happen yeah thank you that that gives me
[1:45:59] encouragement
[1:46:00] but no there's no carnal connections
[1:46:03] with the supernatural
[1:46:06] there can't be they're contrary one to
[1:46:09] another
[1:46:10] god gave one connection
[1:46:13] one device that can push the lever
[1:46:18] and bring the supernatural to the
[1:46:20] natural
[1:46:21] and that's faith and faith has a place
[1:46:27] and that's the word of god faith
[1:46:30] believes what he promised
[1:46:34] and if you want to take the power
[1:46:38] of the word and bring it into the
[1:46:42] natural
[1:46:43] to see that promise do
[1:46:46] its natural work faith
[1:46:50] is the only way that it can travel from
[1:46:54] the supernatural
[1:46:56] to the finished end
[1:46:59] and it'll short out
[1:47:02] any other path any other wire size
[1:47:07] any other method it'll fry it
[1:47:13] you know what happens to a transformer
[1:47:15] when it gets struck by lightning
[1:47:17] it melts down it can't
[1:47:21] hold the current and the only one thing
[1:47:25] that can hold the supernatural current
[1:47:27] all the way to its finished end and
[1:47:29] that's faith
[1:47:31] because faith was designed
[1:47:34] and if it's faith designed to faith
[1:47:38] it has these three attributes reverence
[1:47:42] humility and the willingness
[1:47:45] to go into action and that makes the
[1:47:49] the connection and i think that if
[1:47:52] anything
[1:47:53] this message did for me this morning
[1:47:57] it let me know that i need a lot of
[1:48:00] supernatural
[1:48:02] help to
[1:48:05] to change my attitude change my
[1:48:07] approaches
[1:48:09] no and i can't make a carnal connection
[1:48:12] i can't run out and say okay i'm gonna
[1:48:14] do this and
[1:48:15] i'm gonna do this and i'm going to be
[1:48:17] nicer and i'm going to be sweeter and
[1:48:19] i'm going to you know go mow the net
[1:48:23] neighbor's yard and i'm going to do some
[1:48:26] works
[1:48:27] no i've got to do one thing and that's
[1:48:30] what he said and if i do what he says
[1:48:34] and believe it and trust it
[1:48:39] and know that if i believe it it'll do
[1:48:43] what it said it would do the only
[1:48:45] connection i've faced
[1:48:47] and the prophet of god said he says this
[1:48:48] is our everyday living
[1:48:52] it's our everyday life and i like what
[1:48:54] james said
[1:48:55] in the fifth chapter
[1:48:58] he said above all things my brethren
[1:49:03] swear not neither by heaven neither by
[1:49:06] earth
[1:49:08] neither by any other oath
[1:49:11] but let your yea be yey in your navy nay
[1:49:15] at least you fall in the condemnation
[1:49:20] see right there is the description of
[1:49:23] respect
[1:49:24] and humility and if faith doesn't have
[1:49:28] those characteristics
[1:49:29] it'll fail and it'll fall into
[1:49:32] condemnation
[1:49:33] but listen he said if any among you
[1:49:37] if any among you afflicted let him
[1:49:40] pray is any mary
[1:49:44] let him sing songs is any sick among you
[1:49:48] let him call for the elders of the
[1:49:51] church
[1:49:52] and let them pray over him anointing him
[1:49:56] with oil in the name of the lord
[1:49:59] and the prayer of the faith and the
[1:50:02] prayer of faith
[1:50:03] shall save the sick and the lord shall
[1:50:07] raise
[1:50:07] him up and if he hath committed
[1:50:10] sin they shall be forgiven him
[1:50:15] there was another quote that
[1:50:18] we put on the boards during prayer
[1:50:20] meetings and i
[1:50:21] encourage you to come to prayer meeting
[1:50:24] once a month
[1:50:25] just sacrifice come in and sit
[1:50:28] in the congregation of the lord and
[1:50:31] there's a quote they put up there i'm
[1:50:33] going to add limit the best i can
[1:50:35] it says if you will assemble yourselves
[1:50:39] together
[1:50:41] and call upon the lord he will hear you
[1:50:48] and i thought the other night that's
[1:50:50] exactly what we're doing
[1:50:52] we're actually fulfilling that word
[1:50:56] this is our everyday life our everyday
[1:50:59] life
[1:50:59] is we're right here now praying we've
[1:51:02] gathered together we're praying for
[1:51:04] sister heidi everybody in here praying
[1:51:06] for sister heidi
[1:51:07] everybody in here praying for sister
[1:51:09] parent praying for the need
[1:51:11] praying we're doing exactly what the
[1:51:15] word said to do
[1:51:17] but if we don't have the faith
[1:51:22] to say lord we're doing what you said do
[1:51:25] therefore
[1:51:25] i believe since we're doing this that
[1:51:28] your intended result
[1:51:30] will be fulfilled the work alone
[1:51:34] isn't enough the work alone doesn't
[1:51:36] connect it
[1:51:37] it's the faith in believing he is going
[1:51:40] to do
[1:51:41] what he said i'm doing what he asked me
[1:51:44] to do
[1:51:45] he's going to do what he said that's why
[1:51:48] jesus said every promise that was spoken
[1:51:50] of me i
[1:51:51] did it i fulfilled it therefore
[1:51:54] what is also spoken of me will come to
[1:51:58] pass
[1:51:58] that i'll lay my life down i will not
[1:52:00] suffer thy holy
[1:52:02] one to seek corruption that's when he
[1:52:04] went to calvary
[1:52:05] possessing he had faith in that word
[1:52:13] wasn't one doubt
[1:52:16] the past wasn't what brought him to
[1:52:19] calvary
[1:52:20] wasn't his past works it wasn't the
[1:52:23] miracles it wasn't the things that were
[1:52:25] done
[1:52:25] that brought him to that place what
[1:52:27] brought him to that place is there was
[1:52:29] still a promise
[1:52:30] that had to be fulfilled and there's
[1:52:33] still a promise that has to be fulfilled
[1:52:35] in us
[1:52:38] a quickening power that's going to bring
[1:52:41] every word of god to pass in our lives
[1:52:44] as we need it and the connection
[1:52:47] to the supernatural is faith
[1:52:52] let's don't create another program let's
[1:52:55] don't
[1:52:55] create a teaching let's don't create a
[1:52:58] doctrinal belief
[1:53:00] let's don't create a fellowship let's
[1:53:02] don't create
[1:53:03] a pat on the back and comparing
[1:53:05] ourselves one with another
[1:53:06] let's don't create anything but
[1:53:10] faith in god's word
[1:53:13] hey amen lord bless you musicians come
