[43:52] [Applause]
[44:14] God bless you
[44:15] Church
[44:17] um a short testimony uh uh sometimes a
[44:22] lot of times when we go through Tres U
[44:24] and we remember that verse in Romans
[44:26] that's says uh everything works together
[44:28] for good for those that love the
[44:30] Lord sometimes our human thinking start
[44:33] thinking right that minute like what's
[44:34] the good that would come out of this um
[44:38] but that's just our human thinking um
[44:41] because even in this world we'll get to
[44:43] see the good that comes out of it
[44:45] uh uh I used to
[44:49] have uh stomach trouble upset a whole
[44:52] lot uh so I was uh referred to the G uh
[44:57] I think they all they do is everything
[44:59] inside your tummy and so when they did
[45:01] their test and their scanning everything
[45:03] they said they saw a parasite that could
[45:06] lead to an ulcer so they told me I have
[45:09] to use a antibiotics for two weeks uh it
[45:12] was the most miserable time of my life
[45:14] cuz that two weeks was so bad the
[45:17] medication was just bad uh but I then I
[45:20] used it I didn't bother I was just like
[45:22] okay it is just what it is I didn't
[45:23] bother going back to do the test or
[45:25] anything but then my doctor now did an
[45:28] extra referral to say hey I need you to
[45:31] something to check your colon or
[45:32] something like that so I did the first
[45:35] test well they came back and said it
[45:37] wasn't clear that I would have to do it
[45:39] again I was like okay I just didn't
[45:41] bother thinking about it and then they
[45:44] my doctor referred me again and I went
[45:46] back and when I went back this time um
[45:49] and did the test and did everything um
[45:51] they came back and said they found maybe
[45:53] a quarter of an inch type lump or I
[45:57] don't know what to call it but it's some
[46:00] something swollen in there and that
[46:02] could potentially lead to cancer um and
[46:05] then you know they took it out they said
[46:07] they took it out and then they tested it
[46:10] and when the test came back they said
[46:12] it's nothing it's just something
[46:14] malignant or something like that and so
[46:16] I just want to thank the Lord for that
[46:18] that uh everything that happens happen
[46:21] for
[46:24] good and so I sing this song be of good
[46:30] courage I'll start it
[46:32] somehow be of good courage God spake
[46:38] unto
[46:39] Joshua when Reaver got Point head

[1:04:42] years guess we if the Lord carries we'll
[1:04:44] make it for another

[1:04:57] was back from uh Romania uh getting
[1:05:02] ready to go back and serve the Lord
[1:05:05] there so we're nice to have him with us

[1:05:17] let not your hearts be
[1:05:19] troubled uh that's quite a place to stop
[1:05:23] right there wouldn't it be uh not not to
[1:05:26] let your hearts be troubled uh I I I
[1:05:30] think our hearts get troubled because
[1:05:34] there's uh there's a troublemaker in the
[1:05:37] land today
[1:05:41] amen and so say let their hearts not be
[1:05:44] troubled ye believe in God believe also

[1:06:41] unto him I am the way the truth the life
[1:06:47] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:06:51] if ye had known me you should have known
[1:06:54] my father

[1:07:02] have seen him our gracious father we ask
[1:07:05] you to bless these words to us in your
[1:07:09] precious name we pray amen amen God
[1:07:12] bless you may be seated this
[1:07:16] morning you know I just have a little
[1:07:18] thought on my heart this morning
[1:07:22] uh uh maybe word words of comfort in a
[1:07:27] way maybe words
[1:07:29] of
[1:07:30] understanding uh in this great uh hour
[1:07:35] that we live in you know we live in uh
[1:07:39] the Bible described it as perilous
[1:07:43] times in other words uh in fact I've
[1:07:47] never in
[1:07:49] my time that I've been here I remember
[1:07:53] uh we felt one time that we are on the
[1:07:56] verge of War when the Cuban Missile
[1:07:59] Crisis came most of you I don't think
[1:08:02] were born then but uh uh Russia started
[1:08:07] moving uh um ballistic missiles to Cuba
[1:08:13] and they were going to put uh missiles
[1:08:16] on Cuba and which is only 90 Mi away
[1:08:20] from the United States and that became
[1:08:23] an intimate threat it became a
[1:08:26] danger and uh I I believe the president
[1:08:30] at that time was uh John F Kennedy back
[1:08:34] in the early
[1:08:35] 60s and they decided that they would put
[1:08:39] a naval
[1:08:41] blockade up and so we got our warships
[1:08:44] and we put them out around Cuba and we
[1:08:47] said that we're going to stop it and the
[1:08:50] world was uh we didn't know what was
[1:08:54] going to happen it was uh a great uh
[1:08:58] time of peril and uh I remember uh in
[1:09:02] school that we started uh having uh air
[1:09:07] raay drills uh you know in case of an
[1:09:11] attack and we would all get down uh on
[1:09:15] the ground and put our heads under our
[1:09:18] desks we we look like a bunch of
[1:09:21] ostriches uh you know in our classroom
[1:09:24] all down on our knees with our our uh
[1:09:28] heads under the desk and and we we did
[1:09:32] that everywhere and everybody was
[1:09:33] putting in bomb shelters uh there was
[1:09:36] little bomb shelters going up everywhere
[1:09:39] people digging holes in their backyard
[1:09:41] and sticking little Barrels in there uh
[1:09:44] because we thought there was perilous
[1:09:46] times we thought that uh any moment we
[1:09:50] could be under a nuclear attack and it's
[1:09:54] amazing what PR CS people will take uh
[1:09:58] maybe not even thinking them through uh
[1:10:01] I remember looking at the photographs of
[1:10:03] hirosima after they dropped that atomic
[1:10:06] bomb and I began to realize no little
[1:10:08] school
[1:10:10] desk would have saved me from that you
[1:10:14] know what I mean and no little hole you
[1:10:17] dug in the ground and went and hide
[1:10:19] would hide you from that but I'm glad
[1:10:22] I've got a better hiding place you know
[1:10:25] what I I mean I'm glad I've got
[1:10:26] something that can take me through the
[1:10:29] time of peril that I I have something
[1:10:32] that's just not
[1:10:33] temporary but something that's uh
[1:10:36] permanent you know something that's
[1:10:39] longlasting and and it brought me to the
[1:10:42] little uh uh uh text what remains after
[1:10:48] you know what remains after uh a a lot
[1:10:52] of things that uh we go we go through
[1:10:55] and and and so now we know that there's
[1:10:59] trouble in the Middle East and and
[1:11:02] there's trouble in China and uh they're
[1:11:06] they're worried about China invading
[1:11:09] Taiwan and they're fussing over the The
[1:11:12] Straits of Taiwan and boats are coming
[1:11:15] closer to one another and planes are
[1:11:18] coming close to one another and and Iran
[1:11:22] is a a threatening to shoot missiles on
[1:11:25] Israel and and uh uh that's pretty scary
[1:11:29] and and what's even more scary is we've
[1:11:32] got a possibility of of of a a woman
[1:11:36] president a very real possibility all
[1:11:38] these things were prophesied to us you
[1:11:42] you know what I mean and and uh uh I I
[1:11:46] don't know the time and the hour of them
[1:11:48] but I I know that uh that these are
[1:11:53] uncertain times there there there times
[1:11:55] that are shaky and and there there are
[1:11:58] times that are perilous and we even know
[1:12:01] that even
[1:12:02] spiritually uh we know that that uh
[1:12:06] these are great spiritual times within
[1:12:09] the individual trying to work their
[1:12:12] their way through the problems of life
[1:12:14] trying to work their way through their
[1:12:16] attitudes trying to work their way
[1:12:18] through their thinking uh how how how to
[1:12:22] deal with the Temptations of Satan and
[1:12:26] the battles that go on in our mind and
[1:12:29] the circumstances that are arising all
[1:12:33] around us it it it it just it causes a
[1:12:37] very uh uncomfortable
[1:12:41] atmosphere and especially with the
[1:12:43] financial times and the the conditions
[1:12:46] of finances that uh are are the money is
[1:12:52] not what it used to be you know uh I
[1:12:55] I've seen these charts and that you know
[1:12:58] we used to pay so much for eggs and now
[1:13:00] we're paying this much for eggs and I I
[1:13:04] saw a cartoon a guy went to pay his bill
[1:13:07] and the autom mechanic said I would
[1:13:09] rather have a dozen
[1:13:11] eggs you you you know what I mean that
[1:13:14] that uh money's becoming worthless and
[1:13:18] all these things are working towards
[1:13:20] something you understand there's
[1:13:22] something there's something beyond what
[1:13:25] what is is going on uh yeah there's uh
[1:13:30] we don't always know what's happening
[1:13:34] but we know that there's somebody in
[1:13:36] control and and we know that the world
[1:13:40] belongs the that to the prince of this
[1:13:42] air uh of this world and he's the prince
[1:13:46] of this world but but we don't belong to
[1:13:49] him we belong to somebody else that's
[1:13:52] got a different plan for us
[1:13:55] and and so the as the great perilous
[1:13:59] times come and and and uh we realize
[1:14:03] that you know a brother Bram made this
[1:14:05] statement see if I
[1:14:07] can find it here he says if we know the
[1:14:11] word of God we know where we're
[1:14:15] living we know the hour that we're
[1:14:18] living in we know what lies ahead we see
[1:14:24] what we've passed
[1:14:26] and and so you know what lies ahead you
[1:14:29] know what's after all this so we've seen
[1:14:32] what's passed you know the the reason
[1:14:36] that the world is in confusion the way
[1:14:38] that we're in confusion is because
[1:14:40] Satan's the author of
[1:14:42] confusion I mean things that you
[1:14:45] wouldn't think were even logical people
[1:14:48] have actually accepted thinkings in
[1:14:51] their mind and they're being manipulated
[1:14:54] by
[1:14:56] uh U uh voices in fact we're we were
[1:14:59] told our messenger came and told us he
[1:15:02] said that this is an age of many voices
[1:15:05] there's so many voices out there and
[1:15:08] they're pointing to everything he said
[1:15:10] but yet there's only one voice that
[1:15:12] points to Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ so there there's lots of voices
[1:15:18] so you've got to sit back and and and
[1:15:21] understand hey I'm not worried about
[1:15:25] listening to their
[1:15:27] explanation I should know where I stand
[1:15:30] by the word of God we we know that the
[1:15:34] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[1:15:37] they're not made clear by politics
[1:15:40] they're not made clear by uh geography
[1:15:43] they're not made clear by things they're
[1:15:44] made clear by Divine
[1:15:47] prophecy another we we know by God's
[1:15:50] word that perilous time shall come we
[1:15:53] know that this world is going to perish
[1:15:56] we we know that it's corrupt we know
[1:15:59] that because we saw four hor horse
[1:16:02] riders go out and we know that that last
[1:16:05] horse rider was pale he was he he was
[1:16:09] confusion he was all kinds of stuff
[1:16:12] mixed together and the very thing of
[1:16:15] this lady o see and age is not to be
[1:16:17] lukewarm what is lukewarm hot or cold he
[1:16:20] said I would that you were cold I would
[1:16:23] that you're hot but if you're just
[1:16:25] lukewarm if you're just uh uh halfway in
[1:16:29] and halfway out if if you're not
[1:16:32] committed if you're trying to hang on to
[1:16:34] the world and hang on to the things of
[1:16:36] God but he's saying I can't do anything
[1:16:39] for
[1:16:44] you prophet of God said I wish I could
[1:16:46] get the bride to keep still long enough
[1:16:49] to dress herall
[1:16:55] he tells the story of the time that he
[1:16:58] was wanting to help a lady
[1:17:01] and and she come up and and he trying to
[1:17:06] and and she was just oh brother random
[1:17:09] you know I I'm this and the spirits this
[1:17:11] and Allie was trying to say is sister
[1:17:15] would you be still for a
[1:17:17] moment would you be would you just be
[1:17:22] quiet let me go inside
[1:17:25] and let me find out what's wrong with
[1:17:27] you let the spirit reveal to me what
[1:17:30] your problem is but she would never she
[1:17:33] wouldn't stay
[1:17:36] still you know she wouldn't sit she and
[1:17:40] so that the spirit could discern what it
[1:17:42] was and and and she walked off and the
[1:17:45] prophet of God said she just walked
[1:17:46] right away from her healing I think he
[1:17:49] probably said she probably ended up with
[1:17:51] cancer or something whatever it was
[1:17:54] maybe you recall the story but it's
[1:17:58] something to be still and know that he's
[1:18:05] godall you know don't it it it it's like
[1:18:11] washing clothes excuse my but you know
[1:18:14] the thing's all agitated right and it's
[1:18:16] rinsing and watering and shaking and
[1:18:18] Bubbles and it's going on but you're not
[1:18:22] worried about what the process is you're
[1:18:24] worried what comes after right you're
[1:18:26] looking for some clean
[1:18:29] clothes you know you don't walk up to
[1:18:31] your machine and and say wow look at all
[1:18:35] everything's all in turmoil in there and
[1:18:38] and this and that and it's spinning
[1:18:40] around as fast as it can go you know you
[1:18:44] you you know that there's something that
[1:18:45] comes
[1:18:49] after and and no matter what that he
[1:18:53] stirs up
[1:18:55] or no matter what place you find
[1:18:58] yourself there's got to be something in
[1:19:01] our hearts that we know that there's
[1:19:03] something that comes
[1:19:06] after there's something that comes after
[1:19:09] you know what comes after the
[1:19:12] storm you know when the storm's on the
[1:19:16] it's it's frolicking it's it's tossing
[1:19:20] and it's stormy and it looks like
[1:19:23] there's there looks like there's
[1:19:25] a a great thing the prophet God said
[1:19:27] it's like kind of like a Revival you
[1:19:29] know I mean everything gets going and
[1:19:31] everything but what comes after the
[1:19:33] Revival well what's supposed to come
[1:19:35] after the Revival is all the junk is
[1:19:39] washed up on the beach and a and the
[1:19:41] water becomes still again and it's clean
[1:19:45] and it's still and it's went through a
[1:19:48] period of cleansing is it it's went it
[1:19:51] went through a a period of restoration
[1:19:55] and to revive means to be brought back
[1:19:57] again it's not the excitement it's not
[1:20:00] the Revival itself it's what comes after
[1:20:04] that's
[1:20:06] important what's a conclusion of the
[1:20:09] matter it's not the matter itself you
[1:20:12] know people fuss they argue they they
[1:20:15] negotiate they do all this stuff they
[1:20:18] they but when it's all said and
[1:20:22] done you know it doesn't do you no good
[1:20:25] if you don't if you have a big sit down
[1:20:28] and talk it out and you don't finish it
[1:20:31] out you know if you walk away with
[1:20:34] bitterness still in your heart or you're
[1:20:37] you're not happy with with your part in
[1:20:40] the situation that'll just breed Like A
[1:20:44] little leaven you know pretty soon it'll
[1:20:46] just leaven up in you and it'll start
[1:20:48] rising up again and it'll start coming
[1:20:51] you never got to the matter you never
[1:20:53] got to the purpose purp and you never
[1:20:56] finish the course you know it's like
[1:20:59] repenting when you repent you got to
[1:21:01] repent of it all you know you got to BR
[1:21:04] you got to get down before the Lord and
[1:21:06] you got to pour it all out there you got
[1:21:09] you got to lay it all it don't feel good
[1:21:11] it don't feel good to admit it it don't
[1:21:14] feel good to face your failures it don't
[1:21:16] feel good to to know that you've been
[1:21:19] there 50 times but all that feels bad
[1:21:23] but what comes after it when it's done
[1:21:30] right you know what comes after it I I I
[1:21:34] grew up I was Irish I had a temper and
[1:21:39] and you know when you do something long
[1:21:42] enough you like it I got in fights I
[1:21:44] fought all the time I just like to
[1:21:47] fight of course I got beat up a
[1:21:50] lot cuz I wasn't very big but you know
[1:21:54] when I had some fights and when it was
[1:21:56] all said and
[1:21:58] done those people became my best
[1:22:01] friends cuz we put all the fighting
[1:22:04] behind we put all the disagreements
[1:22:07] behind that wasn't important you know
[1:22:10] what I mean
[1:22:11] it what it's what came
[1:22:15] after and and I think so many times we
[1:22:18] don't we don't really look to what comes
[1:22:22] after and Jesus said these words be not
[1:22:27] troubled you know don't don't be
[1:22:30] troubled in other words well yeah we're
[1:22:34] troubled you know look
[1:22:38] around these are troubl as
[1:22:41] times you know we know it's hard on you
[1:22:44] economically we know your paycheck
[1:22:46] doesn't go we know your grocery bills
[1:22:49] and you know and we sit back and we say
[1:22:51] well we know we've got bills here too
[1:22:54] you know we don't have any we don't have
[1:22:56] any way to to pay our bills without you
[1:22:59] yeah it brings trouble but the bottom
[1:23:01] line right who's in
[1:23:03] control you understand that we we can't
[1:23:06] sit back and I'm not going to sit up
[1:23:08] here and say we need no more money or
[1:23:11] who will give $20 or who will give $100
[1:23:14] or uh or come up with this and say well
[1:23:18] we need to pay this this month you know
[1:23:20] who will dig into their pocket you know
[1:23:22] you don't have to do that if you know
[1:23:24] there's a spirit that's in
[1:23:29] control if you know that there's
[1:23:31] somebody that knows the beginning from
[1:23:33] the
[1:23:34] end so you don't have to focus on the
[1:23:38] trouble you don't have to focus on the
[1:23:42] situation you can you can begin to look
[1:23:45] in your heart and says what comes after
[1:23:49] what comes after this pressure what
[1:23:51] comes after this trial what comes after
[1:23:54] this What's
[1:23:56] following you know what what what's
[1:23:59] going to
[1:24:01] remain when this time
[1:24:04] passes what is it that I am going
[1:24:08] to take possession of and
[1:24:14] have can you
[1:24:16] imagine I think that's if I'm not
[1:24:19] mistaken the
[1:24:22] definition of insanity
[1:24:25] they say is to do the same thing over
[1:24:28] and over again and expect a different
[1:24:35] result you know J it's like having some
[1:24:38] hot wire there right and going up and
[1:24:41] grabbing a hold of it and and it shakes
[1:24:43] you a little bit and you know my dad he
[1:24:45] used to get on a
[1:24:48] board he'd had rubber boots in a board
[1:24:50] and he stand in the board and he'd touch
[1:24:52] that wire and it wouldn't hurt him
[1:24:55] and I'd walk up there in my shoes and my
[1:24:57] boots and I'd touch it and just shake me
[1:24:59] all the
[1:25:00] pieces you know what I mean and I he
[1:25:03] said no no it don't shock you and he'd
[1:25:06] take it and and I
[1:25:09] thought I go but let me tell you
[1:25:11] something after about the third time I
[1:25:14] wasn't about to touch that
[1:25:18] wire because it may not have shocked him
[1:25:21] that's fine but it was shocking me
[1:25:27] right so I realized what come after when
[1:25:31] I touched it it didn't matter for him it
[1:25:34] didn't matter what he was doing it
[1:25:36] didn't matter that he got the wool
[1:25:38] pulled over my eyes you know I had to
[1:25:41] deal with what the result was on
[1:25:46] me what the effect was on
[1:25:49] me you know we see a lot of people that
[1:25:52] get away with things
[1:25:55] we wonder why they're
[1:25:57] blessed you know that we wonder why they
[1:26:00] Prosper we wonder why all those things
[1:26:03] but that ain't the end of the matter
[1:26:05] what comes after it what comes after
[1:26:08] what comes after at the Judgment seat
[1:26:10] what comes after when they got to face
[1:26:12] the reality and the truth of what
[1:26:14] they've
[1:26:19] done can't compare yourselves one to
[1:26:21] another
[1:26:25] this never was a group
[1:26:28] Affair never will be a group Affair it
[1:26:32] isn't the acceptance of your
[1:26:35] personality it's the Revelation that's
[1:26:37] in your
[1:26:40] heart I know I've been born
[1:26:45] again I know I know that what I receive
[1:26:49] from him is
[1:26:52] eternal I know what comes out after this
[1:26:57] life that's what I'm sure of I'm sure of
[1:27:01] what comes after this life and that's
[1:27:04] why the church is built on divine
[1:27:06] revelation no matter who you marri no
[1:27:09] matter what your course is you can know
[1:27:12] what comes
[1:27:14] after what's going to
[1:27:17] remain when your life is
[1:27:22] over a character
[1:27:25] that's been formed in the fiery furnace
[1:27:29] of
[1:27:31] tribulation that you got up and kept
[1:27:35] going you fell you crawled out of the
[1:27:38] mud you walked through the thorn Pat you
[1:27:41] went through the dry places you you went
[1:27:44] through the droughts you went through
[1:27:46] the Showers of Blessings you went
[1:27:48] through all those things but when it was
[1:27:50] all said and done what remains
[1:27:54] after all of your life what remains in
[1:27:59] my father's
[1:28:02] house I've gone to prepare a place for
[1:28:11] you I just think of so many things the
[1:28:16] the prophet said that
[1:28:18] just that strike me so much and things
[1:28:22] that are to be he made this St statement
[1:28:24] he says it was easy for those Jews who
[1:28:27] have been taught through generations to
[1:28:30] believe that there was a great
[1:28:32] Supernatural
[1:28:34] God so they belied that there
[1:28:37] was a great Supernatural God that's the
[1:28:41] god that they worshiped they worshiped a
[1:28:44] God that was a far
[1:28:48] off they they would go
[1:28:52] generations with just remaining in their
[1:28:57] traditions because they weren't taught
[1:28:59] the promise to
[1:29:02] come if they were taught that one day
[1:29:05] Jesus would show up and a virgin shall
[1:29:08] conceive and one day the Brokenhearted
[1:29:11] would be binded and the sick would made
[1:29:14] whole and the blind would see if they
[1:29:16] would have been taught generation after
[1:29:18] generation they would have recognized it
[1:29:21] when he came but they were just Tau that
[1:29:24] he
[1:29:27] was you know what what could do us to
[1:29:30] teach that there is a God we don't want
[1:29:33] a God that's out out there we want a God
[1:29:36] that's
[1:29:38] here we want a God that's that's in
[1:29:42] control of the circumstance that's going
[1:29:44] to show us what remains after this
[1:29:51] life that's what we want we want the
[1:29:58] outcome I watched a guy do a thing one
[1:30:01] time it's very hilarious you ever see
[1:30:03] those guys put X's and O's and and all
[1:30:06] those do do those stupid looking math
[1:30:09] problems you know like Einstein's theory
[1:30:12] or
[1:30:13] relativity you know what I mean so this
[1:30:15] guy he did all this great big stuff and
[1:30:18] he puts a two in there and he does all
[1:30:20] the but the whole bottom line of his
[1:30:22] whole thing was 2 plus two is
[1:30:26] four and the answer was
[1:30:29] four it didn't matter if AAL Z and and B
[1:30:34] * 2 =
[1:30:38] F2 you know oh yeah when I walked into
[1:30:42] class and they put that on the board I
[1:30:44] grabbed a tape
[1:30:46] measure I said that what good does that
[1:30:52] do I couldn't make no sense of it but
[1:30:56] the whole thing of it is it doesn't
[1:30:57] matter all the problem what's the what's
[1:30:59] the outcome of
[1:31:02] it what
[1:31:05] Remains What remains and so he said this
[1:31:09] he
[1:31:10] said to believe that there was a great
[1:31:12] Supernatural God but to
[1:31:15] think that that God had come down and
[1:31:20] manifesting himself through the person
[1:31:23] of of his son Jesus Christ God
[1:31:27] tabernacled in a body of Flesh that was
[1:31:31] a little too
[1:31:33] much for them to
[1:31:38] understand they couldn't grip
[1:31:41] that they could grip God being up
[1:31:45] there they could grip God that he could
[1:31:48] do anything they can understand that God
[1:31:51] was
[1:31:52] Supernatural but understand that that
[1:31:55] God could come down and Veil himself in
[1:31:58] a the very
[1:32:00] appearance that they were in also cuz
[1:32:04] they didn't see God they saw a
[1:32:07] man the only time a man showed up was
[1:32:11] when that man did something Supernatural
[1:32:14] that was beyond a human
[1:32:18] being then they knew that was
[1:32:21] God like the blind boy he said I don't
[1:32:24] know where he comes from I don't know
[1:32:26] this but you're the great rulers of
[1:32:29] Israel you tell me how he took mud and
[1:32:33] made me de
[1:32:35] see whether he be a devil or not I don't
[1:32:38] know but the one thing I know I was
[1:32:41] blind and now I see I know what Remains
[1:32:46] What remains is my
[1:32:50] eyesight and if they could they would
[1:32:52] have taken it away from
[1:32:58] him yeah they told me he's a
[1:33:01] devil and threw him
[1:33:04] out I'm trying
[1:33:06] to bring
[1:33:10] something that if we get so caught up in
[1:33:14] what's going on and we don't understand
[1:33:17] where it's going what it's leading what
[1:33:20] the outcome what we're expecting to have
[1:33:24] when it's all
[1:33:29] finished then then we we end up in this
[1:33:32] great time of it's almost a
[1:33:38] lukewarmness we don't know which way to
[1:33:40] walk we don't know which way to stand we
[1:33:43] don't know what we're believing we don't
[1:33:44] know we don't know what's going to
[1:33:48] happen they just couldn't stand it he
[1:33:51] said but now as you have believed in God
[1:33:56] believe also in me for in my father's
[1:33:59] house are many mansions and I go to
[1:34:01] prepare a place for you Jesus life was
[1:34:05] fixing to end here on
[1:34:09] Earth he had showed the people and
[1:34:12] proved to them that he was Jehovah
[1:34:16] manifested in flesh by great signs and
[1:34:22] wonders all right
[1:34:24] but that isn't what he really was
[1:34:27] pointing
[1:34:29] to he
[1:34:31] said great signs and wonders and re
[1:34:34] references of the Bible that he had
[1:34:38] referred to
[1:34:41] himself and he proved that he was God
[1:34:47] manifested so now that was that's what
[1:34:49] he
[1:34:50] did but he wanted to them to know
[1:34:54] what comes
[1:34:56] after what Remains What remains after
[1:35:00] what he did what remained after the
[1:35:03] signs and wonders what remained after
[1:35:05] the Miracles
[1:35:11] yes that that was what he really wanted
[1:35:13] them to finally come to was what
[1:35:19] remains what's the substance
[1:35:24] what's the
[1:35:26] purpose why did he do all these signs
[1:35:29] and
[1:35:32] wonders what good would it have
[1:35:35] done if it had just been a
[1:35:40] Revival or just been a season of
[1:35:45] blessing what was important is what
[1:35:48] remained
[1:35:50] after and this is what he he concludes
[1:35:53] he he says now he said when you see my
[1:35:57] life ending it's ending for a
[1:36:01] purpose I'm going
[1:36:03] away to prepare a place for
[1:36:06] you that where I am there you may be
[1:36:10] also Jesus therefore is telling his
[1:36:14] disciples that this life is not the end
[1:36:18] in
[1:36:19] death amen this life is not ended in
[1:36:25] death how many of you been through
[1:36:27] trials and you just thought this is the
[1:36:29] end of it
[1:36:31] all you had more bills than you had
[1:36:37] money you know what I mean you you you
[1:36:41] got bills stacked here and your cars
[1:36:44] broke down in the
[1:36:49] driveway I've been there
[1:36:54] you know living out on an old road
[1:36:56] somewhere and
[1:36:58] and just what am I going to I'm going to
[1:37:02] try to hit shik into work see if I can
[1:37:04] make it there at time finally get down
[1:37:07] to work and everything and then then
[1:37:09] they fire you and you don't know and
[1:37:11] you're laying on your floor crying out
[1:37:14] to God oh God what am I going to do my
[1:37:17] rent $60 a
[1:37:22] month you you can go to McDonald's and
[1:37:24] drop 60
[1:37:27] bucks and just lying there they didn't
[1:37:31] matter what the trial was God knew what
[1:37:34] was going to come
[1:37:38] after he knew what the outcome and and
[1:37:41] and we know this he says this to us he
[1:37:44] says now your birth was pre-planned I
[1:37:47] guess you believe that every one of you
[1:37:49] knows that our birth was pre-planned did
[1:37:52] you know that
[1:37:56] you're being here never originated just
[1:38:00] at a myth or a thought everything was
[1:38:03] all pre-planned by God before the
[1:38:06] foundation of the world that you would
[1:38:10] be
[1:38:14] here if he could if he knew that you'd
[1:38:17] be here he knew your trial he knew what
[1:38:21] you were going to go through he knew
[1:38:23] what what was going to come upon you he
[1:38:25] knew the test he knew the the all the
[1:38:29] great results that and circumstances
[1:38:32] that you would be in he's never really
[1:38:35] been so concerned about what you're
[1:38:37] going through as what comes
[1:38:43] after what was trials given for anyway
[1:38:47] what was the fiery furnaces given for
[1:38:49] anyway to build
[1:38:52] character how how come he takes a vessel
[1:38:55] sometimes and completely breaks it down
[1:38:57] and remolds it because that's the love
[1:39:00] of God another form of love of God
[1:39:02] there's
[1:39:03] not if we get so hung
[1:39:07] up with what is
[1:39:11] temporarily transpiring around us it's
[1:39:14] transpiring so fast you can't figure it
[1:39:18] out you've got to have a divine
[1:39:21] revelation that there's something that
[1:39:23] comes after
[1:39:27] this whatever period we're
[1:39:30] in whoever ends up in that white house
[1:39:33] what whoever ends up in the war no
[1:39:36] matter what the bombs drop what
[1:39:38] everything I'm not concerned about the
[1:39:41] Battle I'm not concerned about the trial
[1:39:44] I'm not concerned about the blessing I'm
[1:39:47] concerned what remains
[1:39:53] does my
[1:39:55] Revelation still hold
[1:39:59] steadfast am I still true to everything
[1:40:02] I
[1:40:05] believe some men have come up with
[1:40:07] clever ways to explain
[1:40:12] the the the picture of the cloud I don't
[1:40:15] know where where it is where's it at is
[1:40:17] it up here
[1:40:19] anywhere I guess it's in the back
[1:40:21] brother Tim made a beautiful oh they got
[1:40:23] all kinds of explanations for
[1:40:26] that they got all explanations for every
[1:40:29] Miracle brother down they red decline
[1:40:31] they said I can't find no record of this
[1:40:33] they can't oh all the trials and all the
[1:40:37] voices what
[1:40:40] remains there's nothing can be laid to
[1:40:42] the charge of God's elect because the
[1:40:45] seed of God remains in
[1:40:51] them I can't be hung up I thought of
[1:40:55] these great Bible
[1:40:57] stories I I like this like David and
[1:41:02] and I I always I thought the the story
[1:41:05] of David always strikes me so much you
[1:41:09] know the story of David David's anointed
[1:41:12] to be
[1:41:13] king right all he all Samuel says go
[1:41:17] down to the house Jess he one of those
[1:41:19] guys down there I'm going to make King
[1:41:23] man he starts with the
[1:41:24] biggest and ends up with the
[1:41:30] Run got to be a
[1:41:32] mistake
[1:41:34] no because God's not con
[1:41:38] concerned about the
[1:41:40] middle he's concerned about the end
[1:41:43] that's right so David's anointed well
[1:41:47] David goes out and tend sheep right he's
[1:41:49] out there just doing sheep doesn't seem
[1:41:51] like nothing to him right but you know
[1:41:54] who was tendon sheep king of
[1:41:57] Israel that was who was tendon
[1:42:02] sheep now that was who was tendon sheep
[1:42:05] was one that was going to write some of
[1:42:07] the most inspirational parts of the
[1:42:10] Bible to guide us through psalms and and
[1:42:13] through worship and and and write book
[1:42:16] of wisdom and and and poetry that uh
[1:42:21] would remain in the hearts of of the
[1:42:23] believer forever the Lord is my shepherd
[1:42:26] I shall not want oh hallelujah look what
[1:42:32] remained after all that time being
[1:42:35] shunned in the
[1:42:38] desert right look at at all that time of
[1:42:42] being mocked by his brothers and and and
[1:42:45] being hid from everything what
[1:42:48] remained a book of
[1:42:51] Psalms that blesses us
[1:42:55] today and you know the story he goes out
[1:42:58] there and and and so everybody go
[1:43:01] Philistines come in and and everybody
[1:43:04] goes out to war and his brothers go up
[1:43:06] there and and so David comes in you know
[1:43:09] he slew a lion he slew a bear nobody out
[1:43:14] there he didn't even get a chance to
[1:43:16] testify about it he was burning up to
[1:43:20] testify about it he was just wanting to
[1:43:22] tell every everybody how God delivered a
[1:43:24] lion from him God delivered a bear you
[1:43:27] know what I mean nobody listen to him
[1:43:30] hey man finally he got a chance in front
[1:43:32] of a giant he said God slew a lion God
[1:43:35] slew a bear Hallelujah he was wanted to
[1:43:40] testify he was burned up to
[1:43:44] testify he' been stuck out in the pigeon
[1:43:47] hole somewhere you know sometimes a lot
[1:43:49] of people get to think that they're
[1:43:50] being pigeon Hol they won't use me for
[1:43:54] this they don't use me for that they
[1:43:56] Don't Preach me they don't do this they
[1:43:57] don't do that let me tell you something
[1:44:00] no problem being in the pigeon hole
[1:44:03] God's got a
[1:44:06] time it's what remains when it's son
[1:44:09] said and done I've I've seen lots of
[1:44:12] people come to the Paul but lots of
[1:44:14] people with great popular Ministries
[1:44:16] lots of people that everybody flocked to
[1:44:19] lots of people that people sang their
[1:44:20] praise and they don't even believe the
[1:44:23] word of God
[1:44:27] today it's what
[1:44:31] remains it's what's steadfast it's
[1:44:34] what's inside you don't worry if you
[1:44:36] don't get your glory here you just
[1:44:38] probably be sitting in a wonderful place
[1:44:41] at the
[1:44:42] supper he who humbles himself shall be
[1:44:45] exalted and he who exalts himself shall
[1:44:48] be humbled it's what remains what's
[1:44:50] important
[1:44:54] not what's temporarily blowing through
[1:44:57] and traveling
[1:45:00] through it what's
[1:45:02] endure what's a - tested Memorial how
[1:45:06] does it stand up in the
[1:45:10] face of the
[1:45:15] trials fun to plant a
[1:45:19] garden but it's tough when the drought
[1:45:21] comes
[1:45:24] it's tough when the raccoons
[1:45:27] come and the deer come it's tough when
[1:45:30] the sunburns and and and he goes through
[1:45:36] a hard
[1:45:38] season but if it produces
[1:45:41] fruit you don't dig it
[1:45:44] up you stay with
[1:45:47] it so David goes
[1:45:51] and and
[1:45:53] you know the story so finally he comes
[1:45:55] up he goes to bring some bread up to the
[1:45:58] guys right so he comes up there they
[1:46:00] bring some bread and and
[1:46:03] uh this Philistine comes out and
[1:46:08] challenges
[1:46:09] him and David wants to know who is this
[1:46:12] Philistine who is this
[1:46:14] guy that's
[1:46:16] mocking the
[1:46:18] armies of the Living God
[1:46:23] what what is
[1:46:25] this now everybody else is is is totally
[1:46:29] caught
[1:46:32] up in the
[1:46:35] circumstance in the appearance of the
[1:46:39] circumstance the appearance of the
[1:46:41] circumstance is that the Philistines are
[1:46:44] about to take everything that they have
[1:46:48] but David knew one thing they were not
[1:46:50] going to take his kingdom
[1:46:53] amen right it was promised to
[1:46:57] him so he makes an inquiry he says what
[1:47:01] is going to be given to the man that
[1:47:04] defeats
[1:47:08] this
[1:47:10] giant see David was interested in what
[1:47:15] remained what comes
[1:47:18] after if I go kill this guy I'm not go
[1:47:21] out there and risk my life and kill this
[1:47:23] guy if I don't get a
[1:47:26] blessing he was looking you he says when
[1:47:29] this guy goes
[1:47:31] down what will
[1:47:35] remain what do I lay my possessions on
[1:47:39] what do I have when you go through a
[1:47:41] trial or you go to something remember
[1:47:44] that God is a rewarder of them that
[1:47:47] diligently seek them that's
[1:47:51] right it's his good pleasure to give you
[1:47:54] the
[1:47:55] kingdom it's not bad it's not wrong to
[1:47:59] expect God to give you a
[1:48:04] blessing David wanted to know what it
[1:48:07] was in that I believe it's
[1:48:11] Samuel uh 17 he makes this statement and
[1:48:15] the minute
[1:48:18] he and he came and so and the man of
[1:48:22] Israel said have you seen this man that
[1:48:25] is come up surely to defile Israel he
[1:48:29] has come up and it shall be that the man
[1:48:34] who kth him the king will enrich him
[1:48:38] with great
[1:48:40] riches and will give him his daughter
[1:48:44] and make his father's house free in
[1:48:49] Israel in other words wipe out all debt
[1:48:55] wipe out everything that's laid to their
[1:48:58] charge he'll enrich
[1:49:00] him and he'll give him his daughter in
[1:49:04] other words to be wed and to be part of
[1:49:05] the
[1:49:08] Kingdom so David says this is what comes
[1:49:13] after he
[1:49:17] expected so what what I'm trying to say
[1:49:20] is there may be goliaths in your life
[1:49:23] life there may be things that have risen
[1:49:26] up that seem impossible a wayward child
[1:49:29] a a job situation A a financial
[1:49:33] situation none of those job Giants
[1:49:39] matter I like that song that brother
[1:49:42] with this sh this trial shall be a
[1:49:45] blessing sure your face in a child but
[1:49:49] you have to know beyond a shadow of an
[1:49:51] out after you go through this trial what
[1:49:54] will remain what will be there what will
[1:49:58] be the outcome of it what will be the
[1:50:00] end of the matter the end of the matter
[1:50:03] is God keeps care of his
[1:50:09] children and that's what he
[1:50:14] did he went up and he got in front of
[1:50:17] that giant and he finally had a chance
[1:50:19] to
[1:50:21] testify here's this looking on there and
[1:50:23] David is having a jubilee praise God he
[1:50:27] delivered me from The Lion praise God he
[1:50:30] I killed the bear Hallelujah you know I
[1:50:33] I was doing this and that Giant's
[1:50:35] looking at him what's going on with this
[1:50:41] guy so it wasn't in the
[1:50:45] Revival it's what came after the Revival
[1:50:48] and what followed the Revival was the
[1:50:50] death of Goliath
[1:50:54] and if you have a Revival in your
[1:50:57] life or you have a meeting that you go
[1:51:00] to and the spirit of God moves and you
[1:51:03] you shout and you run and you praise God
[1:51:07] that's wonderful but if the Giants not
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:13] killed what good was
[1:51:18] it you got to look at I feel the spirit
[1:51:21] Lord what's the what's going to
[1:51:24] remain after this Spirit leaves cuz the
[1:51:29] spirit is like a wind it blows and it
[1:51:31] comes and it moves when you don't know
[1:51:33] that it's going to
[1:51:36] move that's why they always tried to
[1:51:39] beat up the spirit beat it up with music
[1:51:41] beat it up with
[1:51:44] temple beat it up with exciting
[1:51:46] preaching and everything and what
[1:51:51] Remains What re what remains after it's
[1:51:54] gone just a desire and that's the
[1:51:57] prophet says the minute the Music Stops
[1:52:00] the worships
[1:52:04] gone it's good to have an outside
[1:52:06] blessing but if that blessing that the
[1:52:09] remainder of that blessing isn't a
[1:52:12] Fountain of Living Water springing up in
[1:52:15] your heart it'll just leave you
[1:52:21] thirsty and if you don't kill the
[1:52:25] giant if you don't cut his head
[1:52:28] off if you don't put an end to
[1:52:32] them you just got a temporary
[1:52:36] reprieve you got to finish the job
[1:52:41] sir if you get a blessing and the spirit
[1:52:44] of God Falls in you and I don't care if
[1:52:46] you run the aisle I I I I praise that
[1:52:49] you'd worship God but let me tell you
[1:52:52] something when that leaves and you walk
[1:52:54] out the door go apply the
[1:53:00] token kill the
[1:53:04] giant they just didn't kill the
[1:53:08] giant they
[1:53:10] pursued the Philistines and slew them
[1:53:20] all we stop at the
[1:53:23] blessing and we don't go on to see what
[1:53:25] remains
[1:53:29] after David had a he had a shouting
[1:53:34] fit man he been wanting to tell
[1:53:36] everybody now he's telling this great
[1:53:38] big guy that don't believe that don't un
[1:53:40] belief don't stop
[1:53:42] God someone don't want to hear your
[1:53:44] testimony tell them
[1:53:50] anyway right you're un
[1:53:53] fire but fire is to burn stuff
[1:53:56] out that's what the fire of the Holy
[1:53:58] Spirit does it burns all the droth out
[1:54:01] it burns the stuff out so you got to
[1:54:04] kill the
[1:54:06] giant and he gets far and he kills and
[1:54:08] he kills a giant I I just I I love that
[1:54:10] because it was what remained
[1:54:14] afterwards what did David get afterwards
[1:54:17] he ended up living in the King's house
[1:54:20] he ended up having Jonathan
[1:54:22] as a booom
[1:54:24] friend of course the king got jealous
[1:54:26] you know the story but David ended up on
[1:54:28] the
[1:54:29] throne and he ended up being Del laay
[1:54:32] the rest with his
[1:54:34] fathers he ended up producing the
[1:54:36] lineage of of the the great king of
[1:54:41] kings and Lord of lords it's just what
[1:54:44] comes
[1:54:45] after sometimes what comes after comes
[1:54:48] after
[1:54:49] Generations people who stood for this
[1:54:51] message went around showing the film
[1:54:54] everywhere mocked and and and and
[1:54:57] everything the the fruits of their
[1:55:00] steadfastness are are rising up today
[1:55:03] the seeds that they planted the
[1:55:05] encouragement that they gave the things
[1:55:07] that they stood for the approach that
[1:55:10] they have though mocked in their
[1:55:12] season it wasn't what was going on in
[1:55:15] the season it's what
[1:55:17] remained that was important
[1:55:22] it's what
[1:55:24] remains I like the story
[1:55:27] of
[1:55:30] Daniel you know the story of Daniel we
[1:55:32] all know the story of Daniel Daniel the
[1:55:34] children of Israel they were taken over
[1:55:36] Daniel went through all kinds of stuff
[1:55:39] all the
[1:55:40] time they built an idol to him and made
[1:55:43] wanted people to worship Him Shadrach
[1:55:45] mhack the bedy go into the furnace they
[1:55:48] went don't we love that story we love
[1:55:51] all these great stories right it wasn't
[1:55:54] the fire that was the important thing
[1:55:56] right it's what re what came after it's
[1:55:59] what remained what remained of all the
[1:56:03] fire one standing in their midst liken
[1:56:07] unto the Son of God that's what remain
[1:56:10] Daniel's great story and just kind of
[1:56:13] coming to a close the this
[1:56:17] morning you know
[1:56:20] that Daniel Prayed three times a
[1:56:23] day he was well respected and his God
[1:56:26] was well respected the king respected
[1:56:30] Daniel and his belief they refused to
[1:56:32] eat the the king's bread they wouldn't
[1:56:36] eat un koshered
[1:56:37] food and they never got
[1:56:40] sick they prospered they did
[1:56:44] well God blessed
[1:56:47] them everything seemed to be going good
[1:56:50] in their lives captive children but you
[1:56:54] know what they did it's like that story
[1:56:55] brother man tells like about the slave
[1:56:58] they were in captivity but they acted
[1:57:01] like children of
[1:57:04] Israel they kept the law they kept the
[1:57:07] Commandments they were true and
[1:57:08] steadfast of their worship he had a
[1:57:11] habit of praying three times a day which
[1:57:13] was his tradition and the and Daniel got
[1:57:16] set
[1:57:20] up you know sometimes you get set
[1:57:24] up get false witness born against you or
[1:57:29] you get accused of

[2:00:31] that condemned
[2:00:33] him when he found the woman at that was
[2:00:36] caught in adultery and he finally looked
[2:00:39] at he says where are your accusers she
[2:00:40] said there's none to accuse you Lord but
[2:00:42] me he said neither will I accuse you go
[2:00:45] and sin no
[2:00:49] more look what remained after that look
[2:00:53] at what her life was look at what her
[2:00:55] testimony was because of what God done
[2:00:58] for her and so we know Daniel so these
[2:01:02] guys set Daniel up 30 days nobody prays
[2:01:06] to any other God to honor you oh
[2:01:10] King now if anybody's going to ask for
[2:01:13] anything they ask for you it's against
[2:01:14] the law for 30 days to ask well they
[2:01:17] knew Daniel was going to go
[2:01:20] pray Daniel didn't have a 30-day
[2:01:24] compromise Daniel didn't have a
[2:01:26] three-hour
[2:01:28] compromise Daniel didn't have any
[2:01:34] compromise he wasn't going to give up on
[2:01:36] the word of God Paul said I'm not
[2:01:37] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
[2:01:40] the power of God to Salvation if they
[2:01:42] cut off my head they cut off my head I
[2:01:44] am not going to deny I have not been
[2:01:47] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[2:01:53] well you're going to go
[2:01:54] to you're going to go to Rome and you're
[2:01:57] going to be Tried by
[2:01:59] Caesar he said the Lord told me what
[2:02:02] things I'd have to suffer for his name's
[2:02:04] sake and then when it finally came down
[2:02:08] to Paul saying what finally remained
[2:02:11] after all his trials after all his
[2:02:13] imprisonment he worked just the same
[2:02:16] through it all he labored through it all
[2:02:18] he preached through it all he stood
[2:02:20] steadfast through it all he was pure as
[2:02:23] gold through it all and when it finally
[2:02:25] come down he said I ran a good race I
[2:02:29] ran a good race I fought a good fight
[2:02:31] now I go to receive the Crown of Glory
[2:02:33] that's laid up for me that's was what
[2:02:36] remained for Paul after it all a Crown
[2:02:39] of Glory is what remained he was more
[2:02:42] concerned in what remained than what
[2:02:44] went
[2:02:48] on what are you going to be on the other
[2:02:51] side of your
[2:02:56] test I like last Wednesday night when
[2:02:58] Heidi
[2:03:00] testified I almost threw my computer
[2:03:03] through the
[2:03:05] ceiling that's
[2:03:09] it the joy of the Lord is my
[2:03:13] strength the joy of the Lord's my
[2:03:16] peace I'll give you peace that's your
[2:03:19] pathis understanding Joy unspeakable
[2:03:22] that's what's matter it's not the trial
[2:03:25] it's what's remain you if you if you can
[2:03:28] if the joy of the Lord Still Remains
[2:03:30] there if the peace of God Still Remains
[2:03:33] there if the steadfastness for the
[2:03:35] commitment Still Remains there if the
[2:03:38] lack of compromise Still Remains there
[2:03:40] then you know beyond the shadow of a
[2:03:42] doubt in my father's house are many
[2:03:45] mansions he's going to come and receive
[2:03:47] me but we forgot that
[2:03:52] we forgot what the end of the matter
[2:03:56] is we just want to bet
[2:04:00] ease we wanted to fix every little tra
[2:04:03] travel every little problem that we
[2:04:06] travel
[2:04:08] through Life's a constant
[2:04:12] Warfare the only thing is is we know
[2:04:15] what remains when the battle's over we
[2:04:19] know what remains when the wor worlds
[2:04:22] consumed by Flames we know what remains
[2:04:26] we know what remains
[2:04:30] after Daniel gets thrown into the den
[2:04:33] right they they they close up the door
[2:04:37] and now the king he can't
[2:04:40] sleep good King
[2:04:43] huh he knew he got trick in the law he
[2:04:47] couldn't even go back the scripture says
[2:04:49] he worked day and night
[2:04:52] politicking around trying to figure out
[2:04:55] a way that he could get out of the
[2:04:57] circumstance that he was
[2:05:00] in I appreciate
[2:05:02] that that's somebody with
[2:05:05] integrity that's somebody you know so
[2:05:08] many times boy if someone gets in a fix
[2:05:11] we're so ready to take the side of the
[2:05:13] finger pointer oh I knew brother McGary
[2:05:15] was a
[2:05:16] creep oh I knew he really didn't believe
[2:05:21] someone gives a false accusation I
[2:05:24] thought
[2:05:26] so not this
[2:05:29] guy he knew Daniel was a man of
[2:05:34] God he witnessed it himself he had taken
[2:05:37] his wisdom he had seen the results of
[2:05:40] his
[2:05:45] counsel and the first little opportunity
[2:05:48] that came to throw him under the bus he
[2:05:50] didn't do it he got tricked he tried to
[2:05:53] make it right and those guys held him to
[2:05:56] it the law of the MEO Persian says if a
[2:06:00] king makes a decree it cannot be taken
[2:06:03] down because if it is it'll destroy the
[2:06:06] Integrity of that office it must get
[2:06:11] fulfilled and the King was forced to it
[2:06:14] he put Daniel in there and he put his
[2:06:17] seal on it because that's what the law
[2:06:19] required
[2:06:22] and he went home and was up all night
[2:06:24] long he did everything to do it but I
[2:06:27] like what he said when he put
[2:06:30] Daniel in the
[2:06:33] grave he said then the king commanded
[2:06:37] and they brought Daniel and cast him
[2:06:40] into the Den of Lions now the king spake
[2:06:43] and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou
[2:06:47] servest continually he will deliver thee
[2:06:55] H
[2:06:57] Hallelujah and then then so the king
[2:06:59] gets
[2:07:01] up and he he runs he runs and then when
[2:07:04] it came he said the king arose very
[2:07:07] early in the morning and went in haste
[2:07:10] unto the den of lions and when he came
[2:07:12] to the den he cried with a lamentable
[2:07:16] voice unto Daniel and the King spoke and
[2:07:20] said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the
[2:07:24] Living God is thy God whom thou servest
[2:07:29] continually able to deliver thee from
[2:07:32] the Lions
[2:07:34] Hallelujah then he said then
[2:07:37] Daniel then said Daniel un to the king
[2:07:41] oh King live
[2:07:44] forever my God has sent his angels and
[2:07:48] has shut the lion's mouth and they have
[2:07:52] not hurt me for much as as
[2:07:56] before so much as before
[2:08:00] him innocence was found in
[2:08:07] me and also before thee O King have I
[2:08:13] done no
[2:08:18] hurt what a testimony
[2:08:23] Daniel
[2:08:24] wasn't Daniel knew one day Israel would
[2:08:27] be
[2:08:28] restored he knew that Kingdom would
[2:08:31] come he was true to
[2:08:34] it no matter how ugly this world gets
[2:08:37] you stay true to this
[2:08:41] message no matter how they mock you no
[2:08:44] matter what they call you no matter if
[2:08:48] they call you homophobic or racist us or
[2:08:52] uh whatever terms that they have uh to
[2:08:57] degrade you I'm not ashamed of this
[2:09:03] [Applause]
[2:09:07] message but here's a little side
[2:09:10] note and the you know so Daniel gets up
[2:09:13] right and the King commanded and they
[2:09:16] brought those men which had accused
[2:09:19] Daniel and cast them into the Den of
[2:09:22] Lions them their children and their
[2:09:25] wives and the Lions had the master over
[2:09:29] them and break all their bones in place
[2:09:33] even they e or even they came at the
[2:09:38] bottom of the den you know why the king
[2:09:41] did
[2:09:42] that he was not going to leave one
[2:09:46] relative he wasn't going to leave
[2:09:48] anybody else to come and and exact
[2:09:50] Revenge
[2:09:52] on
[2:09:54] him and if you're going to get something
[2:09:57] out of your life get it all
[2:10:01] out don't leave nothing around to rise
[2:10:05] up
[2:10:07] again if you're going to lay aside
[2:10:10] something if you're done with sports be
[2:10:12] done with
[2:10:14] sports don't say all right I'm just I'm
[2:10:17] done with sports except for the
[2:10:19] playoffs I'm done with sports except for
[2:10:22] the this or except for that I'm not
[2:10:24] saying it's not lawful to do Sports it's
[2:10:28] fine I don't get in your lives
[2:10:30] concerning sports but I'm saying if
[2:10:33] you're going to do something do it all
[2:10:35] the way don't leave nothing remaining
[2:10:37] that can rise back up and come attack
[2:10:40] you that King did away with it all right
[2:10:44] that's why he told he he told uh Saul go
[2:10:48] out there and wipe them all out
[2:10:52] and then he says why I hear bleeding of
[2:10:55] lambs I hear this stuff what is this I
[2:10:58] hear oh they just saved out the good
[2:11:05] stuff we don't understand sometimes when
[2:11:08] we make a sacrifice but it's not the
[2:11:11] sacrifice it's what's going to remain
[2:11:15] after you get rewarded a h hundredfold
[2:11:18] in this life and the life to come
[2:11:22] we get too hung up in the
[2:11:25] temporary instead of what's coming after
[2:11:28] and and then and then this is the part I
[2:11:31] love the most so what followed
[2:11:34] Daniel the king made a
[2:11:38] decree and he said I make a
[2:11:42] decree that in every Dominion of my
[2:11:46] kingdom men tremble and fear before the
[2:11:50] god of
[2:11:52] Daniel there was nothing more that
[2:11:55] thrilled Daniel's heart than to see his
[2:11:58] God lifted
[2:12:00] up is that the same with you this
[2:12:02] morning there's nothing more in your
[2:12:04] life that Thrills you than to have the
[2:12:07] word of God exalted and lifted up you're
[2:12:11] willing to Bear the reproach because you
[2:12:13] know after it's all said and done after
[2:12:16] all the criticism after Daniel being
[2:12:19] unjustly thrown in the de and I'm sure
[2:12:22] he thought how did I get in this
[2:12:23] condition I'm innocent before God oh
[2:12:27] King I've not done anything wrong but
[2:12:29] here I find
[2:12:35] myself he looked to what was going to
[2:12:41] follow that they fear before God the god
[2:12:44] of Daniel for he is the Living
[2:12:48] God and steadfast forever
[2:12:51] and his kingdom that which shall not be
[2:12:57] destroyed and his Dominion shall be ever
[2:13:01] until the end he
[2:13:21] in the reign of Darius in the reign of
[2:13:26] Cyrus the
[2:13:29] Persian you know
[2:13:32] it's not the trial it's the end of the
[2:13:36] matter and I think the greatest
[2:13:39] example of that is
[2:13:43] job job lived
[2:13:45] upright before
[2:13:48] God so much so that God could brag on on
[2:13:52] him I wish I could stand in front of you
[2:13:56] this morning and say God can brag on my
[2:14:00] life but all God's been doing for me is
[2:14:03] taking his blood and covering this and
[2:14:06] covering this and covering this and
[2:14:10] forgiving me of this and forgiving me of
[2:14:12] that but not job J lives so upright
[2:14:16] before
[2:14:19] God think of it
[2:14:21] so uprightly before
[2:14:27] God that God boast on
[2:14:30] him and the enemy came up and said oh
[2:14:33] he's just that way
[2:14:36] because you built a hedge around
[2:14:40] them it wasn't the blessings that made
[2:14:45] job it was the life that job lived that
[2:14:48] caused the blessings
[2:14:52] and job shared and he prospered and he
[2:14:55] was good and he gave and he took care of
[2:14:59] people he lived a real Christian
[2:15:02] Life and then all of a sudden the enemy
[2:15:05] was let loose on him he said you can do
[2:15:09] everything to him but take his life he
[2:15:12] took his
[2:15:14] family he took his cattle he took his
[2:15:16] sheep he took his land he took
[2:15:19] everything from him
[2:15:23] just think of it and finally his wife
[2:15:27] says why don't you just Curse God and
[2:15:32] die it's not worth going through
[2:15:39] it and then he has his good buddies
[2:15:42] come and all their theological
[2:15:45] explanations and everything trying to
[2:15:47] get job to change his Doctrine and
[2:15:52] change your stance and you know give up
[2:15:54] the picture of the pillar of fire give
[2:15:56] up the picture of the cloud give up this
[2:15:58] give up that don't do this don't do that
[2:16:01] you know it's all this trying to soften
[2:16:03] it all up make it easier and
[2:16:07] better he said no I'm not I'm going to
[2:16:09] stick with
[2:16:11] it I made the
[2:16:14] sacrifice he said he was just and
[2:16:16] forgive it I'll tell you what I'll do
[2:16:18] I'll go make a sacrifice in case
[2:16:22] my
[2:16:23] children when they all got done accusing
[2:16:26] him and he's finally on a as sheep
[2:16:30] scraping
[2:16:32] his
[2:16:35] boils and just miserable and they say
[2:16:40] why don't you
[2:16:41] curse God and
[2:16:44] die he said the lord
[2:16:46] giveth the lord taketh away blessed be
[2:16:51] the name of the
[2:16:57] Lord it didn't matter what he was going
[2:17:01] through is what remained that was
[2:17:07] important and when it was all said and
[2:17:10] done what did job end up
[2:17:13] with and let me tell every time you go
[2:17:17] through a
[2:17:18] trial or every time you go through a
[2:17:21] time of blessing on the other end of
[2:17:23] that you should have a word
[2:17:29] promise you should have a
[2:17:31] promise you should have something that
[2:17:34] you've learned something that you've
[2:17:36] seen something that has given to you
[2:17:39] that know you know will remain Heaven
[2:17:42] and Earth will pass away but my word
[2:17:45] will not pass away you've got something
[2:17:47] that that remains you got something that
[2:17:50] you you can hold on to you could you've
[2:17:53] got something that I've been through
[2:17:54] this storm I've been through this
[2:17:56] blessing so many people go through a
[2:17:58] blessing and they come out of the other
[2:18:00] end with
[2:18:04] nothing so many people go through trials
[2:18:07] and everything and the only thing
[2:18:08] they've got on the other side is they're
[2:18:10] glad it's
[2:18:13] over when you go through something look
[2:18:16] for what remains there should be a
[2:18:18] promise there there should be a Bible
[2:18:20] story you can grab a hold of there
[2:18:22] should be a future that you know a
[2:18:25] promise that you have that makes you
[2:18:27] partakers of divine
[2:18:32] nature and when it was all said and
[2:18:35] done what did job
[2:18:38] have oh he got everything restored back
[2:18:41] to him but you know something if he if
[2:18:44] you had it once and you lost it you can
[2:18:48] lose it again you can be healed from the
[2:18:53] sick and you'll get sick
[2:18:58] again you could have perfect
[2:19:01] health and the only thing that'll keep
[2:19:04] you from tasting death is the
[2:19:08] rapture but yet death has no
[2:19:12] sting grave has no
[2:19:15] Victory but when it was all said and
[2:19:17] done
[2:19:22] it get so it's so beautiful to me
[2:19:25] because when it was all said and done
[2:19:28] what
[2:19:29] remained what did job have in his
[2:19:34] possession that was worth more than
[2:19:36] cattle worth more than
[2:19:39] land worth worth more than everything he
[2:19:43] lost or the time that he suffered what
[2:19:46] was it that he
[2:19:48] possessed that he knew
[2:19:51] that he had a divine revelation of that
[2:19:54] that changed his life forever he was
[2:19:58] finally able to cry out and say these
[2:20:01] great words and though after the skin
[2:20:04] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[2:20:08] shall I see God
[2:20:13] hallelujah that's what he ended up with
[2:20:17] what would you give in exchange for that
[2:20:21] no matter what happens to me Billy if I
[2:20:24] get sick if a disease takes me if I lose
[2:20:28] my mind if I if I I I can't remember
[2:20:32] anybody no matter what comes my course
[2:20:35] no matter what lays ahead of me no
[2:20:38] matter matter what hand has dealt me in
[2:20:40] that this life no matter if I'm thrown
[2:20:42] in a lion stand no matter if I've got to
[2:20:45] meet a Goliath if I'm falsely accused
[2:20:48] and evil spoken of what difference does
[2:20:51] it make if I could say though the skin
[2:20:55] worms Goliath a skin worm the Lions the
[2:20:58] skin worm accusations skin worms they're
[2:21:02] all things that come from this
[2:21:04] flesh and being here in this
[2:21:07] flesh what does it matter if they
[2:21:09] destroy
[2:21:12] me
[2:21:13] yet I shall see
[2:21:18] God job ended up with the same promise
[2:21:22] that Jesus gave him be not troubled in
[2:21:26] my house are many mansions and if it
[2:21:29] were not so I would not tell you I'd go
[2:21:32] to prepare a place for you that where I
[2:21:34] am you may be also and I can stand back
[2:21:38] and say I've Got a
[2:21:40] Mansion I've got a place I'm
[2:21:43] going I don't care if it my life doesn't
[2:21:46] turn out the way I wanted it to I don't

[2:21:51] wanted I don't care if I didn't get all
[2:21:53] these things there's yet there's one
[2:21:55] thing I know though the skin worms eat
[2:21:57] my flesh yet in this flesh as I am I
[2:22:01] shall see God hallelujah it's what
[2:22:04] remains what's
[2:22:08] important if that promise can remain in
[2:22:12] you I've got eternal
[2:22:16] life I shall not taste the second death
[2:22:19] he can take every everything from me but
[2:22:22] he can't take
[2:22:25] that nothing can be laid to the charge
[2:22:29] of God's elect cuz the
[2:22:32] seed remains in him no matter what the
[2:22:37] storm blessings or storms and everything
[2:22:41] you should walk out on the other side of
[2:22:44] whatever you're going through with a
[2:22:46] word promise in your hand
[2:22:53] boy those guys done me wrong but I'm
[2:22:55] going to turn the other
[2:22:59] cheek sometimes you don't even know
[2:23:02] it I've told you this story before I was
[2:23:06] a electrician I was a c i i i was a
[2:23:10] foreman and a superintendent with some
[2:23:13] pretty big electrical
[2:23:15] companies did some pretty big jobs like
[2:23:17] Texas Instruments and different jobs and
[2:23:20] Kelly Moore Factory and things
[2:23:24] and and I I met a lot of
[2:23:28] electricians but I was on a job and
[2:23:31] everybody would make fun of
[2:23:33] me they'd laugh you know and at
[2:23:38] lunchtime I'd try to read my Bible or
[2:23:40] something and if I went into another
[2:23:43] room they'd sit on the other side of the
[2:23:45] wall and turn on
[2:23:47] ACDC as loud as they could
[2:23:51] could you know and they did everything
[2:23:54] they just mocked me and laughed at me
[2:23:57] you know called me name I I didn't care
[2:24:01] you know I just about my business I
[2:24:03] never realized I mean I wasn't going to
[2:24:05] change I couldn't help

[2:24:34] back what a waste of
[2:24:37] time you know what I mean if you don't

[2:24:48] don't let stuff eat you up don't let
[2:24:51] bitterness get in your heart and your
[2:24:52] mind it defiles everything but you know
[2:24:56] I I think I put some change one time in

[2:25:16] I'm bringing this money back to the
[2:25:17] office no we can buy Cokes with that
[2:25:21] their mind wasn't where my mind
[2:25:26] was and and your mind shouldn't be where
[2:25:28] the mind of the world is let this mind
[2:25:31] be in you that was in Christ
[2:25:34] Jesus and I remember I I was there and I
[2:25:37] remember that job and it went on and and
[2:25:41] and uh I was at a supply house
[2:25:44] electrical supply house and and you you
[2:25:47] backed into the supply house to load
[2:25:49] your supplies and everybody was fighting
[2:25:52] for parking places and all of a sudden
[2:25:54] this great big guy I mean he he
[2:25:58] was he he was a big ear and Ben and
[2:26:03] that's
[2:26:06] big and he probably about the size of
[2:26:09] Big John Beal and this guy come walking
[2:26:12] down the counter at me but he had a look
[2:26:15] on his face and he said are you David
[2:26:19] McGary and I thought here goes David and
[2:26:24] Goliath but I couldn't find no
[2:26:28] stones and he walked up to
[2:26:31] me and he looked down at me and he
[2:26:34] started
[2:26:38] crying and I said I said you look
[2:26:40] familiar to me he just balling great big
[2:26:43] guy
[2:26:46] balling he
[2:26:49] said I I've been looking for you for 3
[2:26:57] years well here I
[2:27:00] am he said I wanted to tell you
[2:27:05] something he said I was one of those
[2:27:08] guys that made fun of
[2:27:10] you on that job out at Texas instrument
[2:27:14] and mocked you and put stuff in your
[2:27:16] lunch pil and hid your tools and and let
[2:27:19] air out your tires and and did all those
[2:27:23] all those
[2:27:27] stuff he says and I want to let you know
[2:27:31] that I've given my
[2:27:33] heart to the Lord Jesus
[2:27:38] Christ and he said it was the way that I
[2:27:40] treated you that brought me under
[2:27:43] conviction he says now I'm the youth
[2:27:45] minister at our church at the
[2:27:48] Burleson uh big Baptist Church in buron
[2:27:51] he said I want to thank
[2:27:56] you I want to thank
[2:27:59] you for staying
[2:28:02] true because it's made a difference in
[2:28:06] my life I didn't know what was going on
[2:28:09] then but it's what
[2:28:11] remained that's
[2:28:15] important guard your
[2:28:18] testimony stay true to the word of God
[2:28:22] don't worry about what you're going
[2:28:24] through your trials your tribulations
[2:28:28] don't worry about whether you're blessed
[2:28:32] a blessing is just like a
[2:28:34] trial it's just one way that God deals
[2:28:38] with your life to keep you balanced when
[2:28:42] you go through a blessing what remains
[2:28:44] after the blessing
[2:28:51] what ground do you gain what is it that
[2:28:54] you have what is it that you learn what
[2:28:56] Eternal possession do you take care hold
[2:29:00] of what promise because it's by these
[2:29:03] exceedingly great and precious
[2:29:07] promises that you become
[2:29:10] partakers of divine
[2:29:12] nature and I thought is that kindy

[2:29:17] my heart you stood for me
[2:29:20] and I'll stand for
[2:29:22] you and I believe that guy he may never
[2:29:24] come to this
[2:29:27] message but I'll tell you that act of
[2:29:30] humility showed me one thing he meant
[2:29:33] the same Jesus that I
[2:29:35] met right and I believe that'll be laid
[2:29:39] up for him as a reward that's in the
[2:29:42] hands of the father it's my job to know
[2:29:46] one thing it's what remains that that's
[2:29:50] important it's not what I go through
[2:29:53] it's not Daniel going into the den it
[2:29:55] wasn't David facing Goliath it wasn't
[2:29:59] job having everything taken from him
