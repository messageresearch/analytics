[29:12] I I just think that's wonderful so what
[29:15] we're going to do tonight they're going
[29:17] to tell us about their trip and and the
[29:19] how the Lord worked I think we can sing
[29:23] a special no because we're good
[29:25] musicians
[29:26] so much tonight and I have I think they
[29:30] have some presentation and stuff so just
[29:32] remember they're people all over the
[29:34] world just like you
[29:37] same blood purchased them
[29:39] same devil fights them
[29:41] they're hungering for the same word and
[29:44] the church all over the world is built
[29:46] on the same thing Revelation and faith
[29:50] is our foundation and Faith cometh by
[29:53] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[29:55] and without faith it's impossible to
[29:59] please God every time the word of God is
[30:03] preached or shared it gives you an
[30:07] opportunity to believe
[30:11] to say Amen in the say I believe and it
[30:16] builds your faith so even when you're
[30:18] down in the dumps read your Bible listen
[30:22] to the word of God come hear the word of
[30:24] God because that that little seed inside
[30:26] of you when it hears the word of God
[30:28] it'll say
[30:30] I believe that
[30:32] amen and you'll just feel that Faith
[30:35] start rising up in you so I don't know
[30:37] what the brothers have planned for us I
[30:39] know that I'm gonna go down here so I
[30:42] can sit back and watch so Brothers we
[30:45] put the service in your hands to see me
[30:47] Andrew you gonna start first okay this
[30:50] is Andrew he's the tallest he goes first
[30:52] and are you coming to his husband after
[30:56] this is God all right Lord bless you
[30:58] both
[31:00] enjoy your matches praise the Lord
[31:02] aren't you thankful for a Godly Pastor
[31:04] they can still do the the song leading
[31:07] and you know what a real example
[31:10] what a real example of what it's like to
[31:12] be a servant and
[31:14] you know I'm just really thankful that
[31:15] we can come together tonight and have a
[31:18] little Fellowship you know it's a very
[31:20] unique service in that for one our
[31:22] pastor's song leading and for two we're
[31:24] going to give a report we're really
[31:26] excited what God has done
[31:28] but if we just take a moment maybe we
[31:29] can all stand and if we can offer a word
[31:32] of prayer we'll read a scripture and
[31:34] we'll trust the Lord will have his way
[31:35] in the service I know that you've come
[31:37] expecting and you've come believing
[31:40] and we just want to you know put the
[31:43] thought to the side that this is just
[31:44] another service
[31:46] there's something special that the Lord
[31:48] has in store for each one of us so as we
[31:50] read the word of God pull life right out
[31:53] of the word for the season of life that
[31:55] you're in because God has something very
[31:57] special for each and every one of us and
[31:59] every time God gives Revelation it's
[32:01] because there's something right around
[32:02] the corner that we need to overcome
[32:05] and it's by the word and faith in the
[32:08] word that we can overcome every obstacle
[32:10] that the devil puts in front of us amen
[32:13] so let's just if you have a special need
[32:15] and
[32:16] there's an atmosphere here that you
[32:19] believe that if you can just Touch the
[32:21] Hem of His Garment that he would meet
[32:22] your need and you just hold that in your
[32:25] heart and watch how he'll come and he'll
[32:27] he'll give you your heart's desire let's
[32:29] pray together
[32:31] our precious Lord how we thank you God
[32:34] for your presence Lord we thank you for
[32:36] your promise Lord that Lord when we've
[32:40] looked to the Unseen Lord that you're
[32:43] there Lord and by faith in the word Lord
[32:46] we can draw dividends from your promises
[32:48] Heavenly Father Lord we're looking right
[32:51] now to the death of your innocent son
[32:54] and what it meant Oh God it it loosed us
[32:58] from the bondage of sin Lord how we love
[33:00] you Lord our hearts go out to you in
[33:03] this service Lord father we need you
[33:05] Lord we need Revelation Lord so we call
[33:08] upon the name that's above every name
[33:10] that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:13] father do for us what we cannot do for
[33:16] ourselves will you open the word of God
[33:19] to every heart here that's Longing For
[33:21] Truth Lord wants to see you o God lift
[33:24] it up once again out of History Lord and
[33:27] is a present tense to meet them at their
[33:30] point of need father we're thankful Lord
[33:32] that you've brought many that were sick
[33:34] oh God on beds that were ill and and not
[33:38] feeling well and they're in the house of
[33:39] God to rejoice and to thank you for your
[33:42] grace and your mercy Lord thank you for
[33:44] your healing virtue father how we love
[33:47] you Lord the few words that we would say
[33:49] Lord may bring you glory and honor
[33:51] father will will our hearts be lifted up
[33:54] as we unite together in this great hour
[33:56] what you've done in this day and what
[33:58] you're doing now in this time in this
[34:01] local body Lord we just want to give you
[34:03] praise in honor Lord and may each heart
[34:06] hear Lord when we leave Lord may they
[34:08] have touched you and received from you
[34:10] something of an eternal value that would
[34:13] help them along the life's way in Jesus
[34:15] Christ's name amen
[34:17] so I just wanted to read in John chapter
[34:19] 17 something that the Lord put on my
[34:21] heart and as our pastor was ministering
[34:24] this Sunday morning and something the
[34:26] Lord definitely impressed upon my heart
[34:28] I feel like if we just go right to
[34:30] chapter 17 and verse 17 it says this and
[34:35] will try not to
[34:36] labor too much but we do have something
[34:39] on our heart and we just
[34:41] we'll just lay something here and if we
[34:43] have time something after the the
[34:44] presentation of our mission trip maybe
[34:46] we can share a few things maybe a few
[34:48] minutes of what the Lord's laid on our
[34:50] heart but we just figured if we can open
[34:52] the word of God and God could speak
[34:54] through his word amen so it says here
[34:56] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[34:58] is truth
[35:00] as thou has sent me into the world even
[35:03] so have I sent them into the world and
[35:05] for their sakes I sanctify myself that
[35:08] they also might be Sanctified through
[35:11] the truth
[35:12] amen you may have your seeds
[35:16] you know it it was a a accumulation of
[35:21] time for me personally I I um just in
[35:25] December we went to Romania I hadn't
[35:27] been on a trip a mission trip for six
[35:31] years I went to Honduras in 2017 and the
[35:35] Lord was so gracious and um
[35:37] when uh brother Elias who's the pastor
[35:40] that extended the invitation to come to
[35:43] Africa I met him in 2017 in a men's
[35:46] retreat in Newport and it was the first
[35:49] time that he came to America and he
[35:51] traveled through here he ministered one
[35:53] day here and really was blessed by him
[35:57] Ministry and I even remember what he
[35:59] preached it was so profound to me but he
[36:01] just has a real Meek humble Spirit
[36:03] really loves the Lord and so we had
[36:06] lunch together and he told me he said
[36:07] you know brother you know it's different
[36:09] in Africa you should come sometime and
[36:11] you know I held that in my heart and I
[36:13] prayed about it and he he would reach
[36:15] out to me and say come brother come and
[36:17] he stayed with me this this has been six
[36:19] years in the making and so I just um you
[36:22] know in in September you know I felt
[36:25] like you know God has done so much for
[36:27] me and I finally just told my wife I
[36:30] said honey and this was in September I
[36:32] said look I just feel like I'm just not
[36:34] doing what the Lord's telling me and you
[36:37] might feel the same way but this is the
[36:39] way God deals with his sons and
[36:40] daughters you know you you make a vow in
[36:42] your heart you say you know I'm just
[36:43] going to do it and so just like our
[36:46] pastor read about those two sons one
[36:48] said he would do it and didn't and then
[36:49] the other said he wouldn't do it but
[36:51] then he ended up doing it so I felt like
[36:53] that was fitted and it was it was the
[36:55] way that the Lord had dealt with my
[36:56] heart and so whenever this opportunity
[36:59] came up I had a battle because around
[37:02] this time
[37:03] brother Cosman had asked me to pray
[37:05] about something and and so he didn't
[37:08] know what I'm sharing with you at the
[37:10] time I told him later but he didn't know
[37:13] that I had already had a burden but I
[37:17] just I had made every excuse in the book
[37:19] okay so by the time brother cosman's
[37:23] asking me I didn't have any more excuses
[37:25] and so it was now up to me and so you
[37:29] know how sometimes we say if if I'm
[37:32] going to do something if it's it would
[37:34] be worth it if one Soul if would be
[37:38] transformed and I really in my heart I
[37:41] felt so compelled that even if one Soul
[37:44] wasn't affected I'm doing the will of
[37:46] the Lord and so I think I think it's a
[37:49] time where we just we want to fulfill
[37:51] our calling every one of us have a
[37:53] Ministry everyone has a calling
[37:56] everybody has a fulfillment and so I'm
[37:58] just falling on the sword tonight
[38:00] letting you know that I was being
[38:01] dilatory about my duty but I feel like
[38:04] it's a time where we must wait on our
[38:06] ministry every single one of us there's
[38:08] a character that God's developing in
[38:10] each one of us to be able to take the
[38:13] word of God and let it deal with this
[38:15] world first and then you can go out into
[38:17] the world because it's no longer you
[38:19] that liveth but it's Christ in you amen
[38:21] so as we accepted brother cosman's
[38:25] called to pray about it and then when he
[38:28] began to share it with me the picture
[38:30] became real clear that now you know it's
[38:34] not time to be a coward
[38:36] it's time to be brave and to stand up
[38:39] for what I believe and I never
[38:41] experienced what what I was going to
[38:44] come into but there's this theme that I
[38:46] feel like I'm entering into I'm coming
[38:48] into a lot of first I've never been here
[38:49] before and I feel like I can identify
[38:52] with Abraham God was calling him to a
[38:54] land that he had never been this is a
[38:56] land of Faith so every day every step of
[38:59] the way we must be willing to venture
[39:01] out on the promises and Watch God's hand
[39:05] work in our lives so this was just
[39:07] another extension for me and so I'm
[39:10] really grateful that we can share a few
[39:12] things that the Lord put on our heart
[39:15] and so we definitely want to bring you
[39:17] greetings from Brother Elias and I found
[39:19] in brother Elias that he's been laboring
[39:22] and he's very missionary minded so he's
[39:24] been laboring Mo you know they don't
[39:27] deal with things like things in America
[39:29] where there's a lot of pollution with
[39:31] with
[39:32] um you know the things that we have a
[39:34] lot of what they have it seems like
[39:35] there's a lot of tribal
[39:37] um influences and culture and so there's
[39:39] a lot of things that are still needing
[39:42] to be dealt with in the word of God but
[39:43] they're very different and so as brother
[39:46] Elias has gone out he's made contact
[39:47] with different people and different
[39:49] churches has rose up and gone out and so
[39:52] from these we're going to share with you
[39:54] a few places that we visited we visited
[39:57] four different places and so these are
[40:00] offshoots of people that have wit that
[40:02] he's witnessed to and then they become
[40:04] pastors and they go out into the bush
[40:06] they go out into the where they have to
[40:09] take boats and run out and all kinds of
[40:11] stuff so these churches that we visited
[40:14] are actually they're the fruit of this
[40:17] message and so they're they're hungry
[40:19] for the truth they receive the truth
[40:21] they do the same thing that we do and
[40:24] when Revelation strikes us so
[40:28] maybe I'll give
[40:30] this opportunity for brother Cosman I
[40:33] can't do this stuff very well but he's
[40:35] very good at it so I'll turn it over to
[40:37] our brother Cosman and let him kind of
[40:40] share from his heart a few things and
[40:42] then uh we'll just run it that way
[40:45] come brother Cosman
[40:48] foreign
[41:04] he takes care of our needs
[41:07] he knows how to lead us
[41:10] he knows how to guide us
[41:12] and um
[41:15] I'm not going to be very long
[41:17] you know when
[41:18] we try to give a testimony you know
[41:20] sometimes if you go into every detail
[41:22] things could take quite long so we're
[41:24] just gonna
[41:25] just say a few things but
[41:28] you know um
[41:31] this is a testimony service
[41:35] and the word the word of God is a
[41:37] testimony
[41:39] it's um
[41:42] it's a testimony for a Believer when he
[41:44] sees the word come to pass
[41:47] because otherwise it's insane
[41:50] and when you're convinced of the life of
[41:54] the word
[41:56] then you become concerned about others
[41:59] because that's what the Life of Christ
[42:01] is
[42:02] it wants to share the very thing that it
[42:05] has
[42:06] it wants to it wants to pour out the
[42:09] very life that now we received he wants
[42:12] to give it out
[42:13] and there has to be somebody that would
[42:15] receive it
[42:16] otherwise you wouldn't have it
[42:19] so if you have it now it's needed to be
[42:22] sewn to somebody else because it's
[42:24] needed
[42:25] God's still calling
[42:28] and so I
[42:30] um
[42:33] I you know I just kind of had this in my
[42:35] mind you know a test
[42:38] that God puts before you in the word of
[42:40] God plus a ceremony
[42:43] is a testimony
[42:46] you know because now God puts a test for
[42:48] you and then there's a ceremony there's
[42:50] a victory at the end of that and that
[42:51] becomes Living Word now
[42:54] and you know being led of the Holy
[42:57] Spirit and walk into the into the
[42:59] footsteps of the word is what we're
[43:00] called to do
[43:02] we're called to let go of our own flesh
[43:05] we're called to let go of our ideas
[43:07] our thoughts our accomplishments all
[43:10] that this flesh wants to do
[43:12] but to concentrate on one thing that's
[43:14] Eternal and that's fulfilling the very
[43:17] word that was sent for us to fulfill
[43:20] and if we're busy
[43:22] and carried away into the things that
[43:25] may be take away our
[43:28] concentration on what the image should
[43:31] be
[43:32] then you'll throw a test and then you
[43:35] know he he he works his kids out his
[43:37] children out for his good
[43:40] I'm just going to read a quote and
[43:43] and a little
[43:46] quote because I want to make sure I say
[43:49] this
[43:50] if it's not for the word of God we
[43:52] wouldn't have anything
[43:56] if it wasn't for the message of the hour
[43:58] we wouldn't even be able to come up and
[44:01] say anything before the people
[44:03] because it's not what we can come up
[44:05] with it's not an idea or a revelation
[44:08] that I could come up with but the very
[44:10] word that came came to take flesh and
[44:13] not only to be preached but to be lived
[44:16] the word of God has to be lived
[44:20] John 16 says I have yet many things to
[44:23] say unto you
[44:25] but ye cannot hear them now
[44:28] verse 13 it says how be it when he
[44:31] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[44:34] guide you into all truth
[44:37] for he shall not speak of himself
[44:40] but whatsoever he shall hear
[44:43] that shall he speak
[44:45] and he shall show you
[44:48] things to come
[44:51] he shall glorify me
[44:53] for he shall receive of mine
[44:56] and shall show it unto you
[45:00] the word of God
[45:03] coming as a guide to show us the truth
[45:08] and I believe that we all know the
[45:10] message of the hour and what this
[45:11] message is and how we can go and find
[45:17] food in due season
[45:19] where it heals a womb
[45:22] where it provides Deliverance
[45:25] where it provides
[45:27] expectation where he could speak to us
[45:31] brother Branham says this and
[45:33] 1962 a guide he says see
[45:38] you need the guide
[45:40] he will guide you to truth
[45:44] and Truth is the word
[45:46] he says he will guide you it always been
[45:50] it he says and it always has been that
[45:53] way
[45:55] I love it I love it because it's so
[45:57] simple
[45:58] we don't have to complicate it we don't
[46:01] have to come with our own way of saying
[46:04] well this is the way it should be you
[46:05] know sometimes we can force ourselves
[46:07] into scripture and and and it cannot be
[46:09] the will of the Lord
[46:10] but it has to be revealed that has to be
[46:13] in due time it has to do in due season
[46:15] and if we're not sensitive enough to
[46:17] recognize him by his word and how he is
[46:19] revealing himself then we're missing the
[46:22] very steps
[46:23] of how what he wants what he wants us to
[46:26] walk into
[46:27] it says God don't ever change nothing
[46:31] because he's infinite and he knows
[46:33] what's best
[46:35] his omnipresent his omniscient he's
[46:38] everything it's right God is
[46:41] so he don't have to change
[46:44] he says he is a confirmer of the way
[46:48] he's leading
[46:50] the Holy Ghost will guide
[46:53] the guide is the confirmer of the same
[46:57] word that he's teaching
[47:00] so now that he's teaching he actually
[47:02] come comes back and confirms the very
[47:04] reward that he's teaching you if it
[47:06] doesn't take flesh it'll remain as a
[47:09] Doctrine
[47:10] every word has to take flesh
[47:15] I love it because this is the prophet's
[47:18] words this is the word that was came
[47:20] that came for for us for for his sons
[47:22] and his daughters
[47:24] it says now Luke was led by the guide it
[47:27] says to say go he into all the world
[47:30] preach the gospel to every creature
[47:36] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[47:39] be saved
[47:42] he that believeth now shall be damned
[47:44] and these signs shall follow them that
[47:46] believe in my name they shall cast out
[47:49] devils
[47:50] speak with new tongues take up serpents
[47:53] that drink deadly things lay hands on
[47:56] the sick and they shall recover and the
[47:58] Bible said that they went forth
[48:01] everywhere led by the guide you know
[48:04] preached the word with signs following
[48:08] what was it the guide vindicating that
[48:12] was the truth
[48:14] so the essence wasn't the signs and the
[48:16] Wonders
[48:18] that came following because of his
[48:20] presence of the word but it was the word
[48:23] that came
[48:24] that changed or that could change an
[48:27] individual
[48:29] and so
[48:33] I met brother Eliason
[48:36] 2017 myself and he's he's become a
[48:39] really good friend of mine over the
[48:40] years we've just been communicating
[48:45] I
[48:47] I can relate to brother Elias a little
[48:49] bit because the way that you know maybe
[48:52] Africa is it was the way that I grew up
[48:55] when I was a little child and so I know
[48:57] sometimes the hardness of you know life
[49:00] and not having and the things that maybe
[49:02] take place in a country like that
[49:05] and so I always was there for him in in
[49:09] a word of encouragement if you need
[49:10] anything not financially at all but just
[49:13] as a friend
[49:15] because you know sometimes it's good to
[49:17] have friends where we can sharpen one
[49:19] another
[49:20] they were we're brothers we know we
[49:22] believe the same word it produces the
[49:24] same fruit you know we're we're brothers
[49:26] it doesn't have to be just here we're
[49:29] you know this is a worldwide bride
[49:33] oh
[49:34] and so brother Elias has
[49:37] asked me for the past maybe a year and a
[49:40] half to just kind of think about going
[49:41] and
[49:42] you know the word at that time was
[49:44] dealing with my life in a different
[49:46] direction and so you know that's where
[49:50] we were going and so you know he asked
[49:52] me again I would say three four months
[49:54] ago
[49:56] and I told him I would pray about it and
[49:59] it was a it was a really tough time for
[50:01] me because
[50:03] I was busy with work and then at the
[50:05] same time my grandmother had passed away
[50:07] and so I just come back you know there
[50:10] was a lot of things that were
[50:12] transitioning in my life and so
[50:14] I had to sit back and just be patient
[50:16] and wait upon the Lord I'm like Lord I
[50:18] could make a wrong choice
[50:19] and and so
[50:22] um
[50:23] you know I I've just I told him I said I
[50:26] would pray about it well I didn't answer
[50:28] within a weekend so he wrote me a
[50:30] message and it says brother Cosman he
[50:32] said if you'd help I can ask my my
[50:34] church to fast and pray for you and I'm
[50:36] like oh okay
[50:39] um I said okay
[50:40] and so he said okay so he had the church
[50:42] fast and pray for her I would say a few
[50:45] days and he's like okay we'll have you
[50:46] decided anything and I told him I said
[50:48] you know brother lies
[50:50] I'll commit myself to come
[50:53] and um
[50:54] I told them one thing as we were on the
[50:57] phone you know Saints it's always good
[50:59] to have expectation
[51:02] because expectation brings the word to
[51:05] be manifested in its proper time or
[51:08] season
[51:09] and and so I told Brother Elias has like
[51:12] it's like brother brother Elias you know
[51:14] I it was a really hard decision for me
[51:17] but I said I said I'm under great
[51:19] expectation because I know the devil was
[51:21] trying to fight something
[51:23] and and so
[51:25] he was encouraged
[51:27] and so at that at that time
[51:31] I I had related to my brother Adrian
[51:33] that I was I was going to go and so he
[51:36] comp he was compelled himself to join
[51:37] with us too
[51:39] and so at that point it was just me and
[51:41] him going together just knowing that
[51:44] brother Alaska was going to take us and
[51:46] so
[51:47] and then brother Andrew just ended up
[51:49] coming towards the end whenever time got
[51:51] closer to the date but
[51:54] you know
[51:56] everything that we do is
[52:00] with the desire of the word to be
[52:02] fulfilled
[52:03] if there's no fruit coming out of the
[52:08] very life that we live
[52:10] then then it's dead you know it it
[52:12] starts losing its value it starts losing
[52:15] its beauty it does it starts losing the
[52:17] very essence the very existence of what
[52:19] it is a tree
[52:21] cannot look and it's perfect will or
[52:24] it's perfect Beauty unless it's fully
[52:26] grown It's gotta It's gotta have its
[52:28] fruit
[52:28] and so
[52:30] you know I I've
[52:32] I've had that desire for my life I was
[52:34] like Lord
[52:35] you know I want to walk in your will I
[52:37] want to be in your word I want to make
[52:38] sure that I follow the footsteps of your
[52:40] word and so whatever Direction You Lead
[52:41] Me I'll Follow
[52:43] and so I know that if I do that
[52:46] safer
[52:48] because I will make a wrong choice
[52:50] and so
[52:51] um
[52:53] now that we're traveling 28 hours
[52:58] yeah
[53:01] I text this picture to some of the
[53:04] brothers and Brother David as we were
[53:05] just Landing this was 30 minutes away
[53:07] from Landing
[53:10] and that cloud was from my window me and
[53:12] Andrew were sitting right behind each
[53:14] other and that was a cloud
[53:16] and he was right above tanzania's right
[53:18] above Kilimanjaro where we were arriving
[53:21] and um
[53:23] this is just a picture but I actually
[53:25] took a video it's a cloud within itself
[53:27] and there's lightning just going up and
[53:30] down the way you see it it was for a
[53:32] good 10 minutes
[53:34] and it was constant
[53:36] you know I took a earlier picture where
[53:39] you could almost you can almost see a
[53:40] face to it but
[53:42] I don't know I'm a spiritual guy so I'm
[53:43] like Lord you're doing something great
[53:46] now I have even greater expectation that
[53:48] you're moving why why can't we do that
[53:50] Saints
[53:51] why can't we have expectation to know
[53:53] that we could even see God and his own
[53:55] creation leading his sons and his
[53:57] daughters
[53:58] I got I got comforted by that
[54:01] and so
[54:03] as we were just um
[54:06] Landing down brother Elias ended up just
[54:08] receiving Us in really
[54:10] nicely he had a brother out there at the
[54:13] airport
[54:14] and the process in Tanzania is really
[54:17] hard because you have to get a Visa
[54:20] and all of these things and so he had a
[54:23] brother that was working at the airport
[54:24] and so
[54:27] he bypassed a few things and we ended up
[54:30] leaving a lot faster because the lines
[54:31] were really long
[54:33] and so he really saved us there
[54:36] um
[54:37] so
[54:38] once we arrived we ended up checking
[54:40] into a a room and then so the next day
[54:42] this was Tuesday we arrived I think we
[54:45] were traveling for a little bit and then
[54:47] we arrived Tuesday evening and then
[54:48] Wednesday we had two Services already
[54:50] scheduled so we had 10 services in eight
[54:53] days we had two on Wednesday two on
[54:56] Thursday Two on Friday one on Saturday
[54:59] two on Sunday and then one on Tuesday
[55:01] and so we arrived there Tuesday night
[55:04] really tired
[55:05] and then now we're
[55:09] we're arriving at our first church
[55:12] and this is about 40
[55:14] kilometers away from Arusha
[55:17] most of you guys may know Tanzania I
[55:20] know some of the people from Africa that
[55:22] you guys know where that's at but
[55:25] this is in a town called Le guruki
[55:27] Tanzania
[55:29] Le guruki it's about 40 kilometers away
[55:31] from the main town it's a small little
[55:33] church
[55:35] the pastor of this church his name is
[55:39] Malachi
[55:41] and uh brother Andrew was saying about
[55:45] when you're convinced and the word comes
[55:49] in your life
[55:50] now you start being concerned
[55:53] and so because the very life that now
[55:56] brother Malachi had received he started
[55:59] being concerned about other lives
[56:01] and brother Elias was showing us a few
[56:03] pictures about how he takes a canoe
[56:06] across Rivers into the jungle with his
[56:09] motorcycle and they canoe his bicycle
[56:11] his motorcycle to the other side of the
[56:14] Jungle and then from there he takes a
[56:16] bike
[56:18] and he goes into the jungle and he's
[56:20] talking to people that has never heard
[56:23] about God
[56:25] doesn't even know who God is doesn't
[56:26] even know what the Bible is doesn't know
[56:29] how to read the Bible doesn't know the
[56:30] stories of the Bible so he sits there on
[56:33] a tree log but their alas was telling us
[56:35] and he starts from from from the basis
[56:38] he says okay this is what God is
[56:40] this is this is what happened here in
[56:42] the Redemption here's what happened so
[56:44] he's walking them with the message of
[56:46] the hour and the Bible together and
[56:48] they're just loving it
[56:50] their their life is changed
[56:54] um and so this is Brother Malachi's
[56:55] church here where he's pastoring
[56:59] and um if I can say something you know
[57:01] one thing that I noticed when we were
[57:03] there it's very different than it is
[57:05] here everybody walks everywhere I'm
[57:09] serious you're driving down the highway
[57:10] and there's tons of people just walking
[57:12] and they have these motorbikes and these
[57:14] they look like golf carts with three
[57:16] wheels they're everywhere
[57:18] and it's not like if you have like a car
[57:20] with four-wheel drive or something
[57:21] that's kind of rare you you obviously
[57:23] have wealth and so the thing about when
[57:27] we were going to this church like once
[57:30] we got off the main road and we turned
[57:33] it's a dirt road and it's bumpy and
[57:35] there's there there's Shepherds driving
[57:38] cattle over the road and this road is
[57:40] like and so as we were going I mean what
[57:44] what's interesting about this church it
[57:46] always hasn't been like this they used
[57:49] to get dropped off at a bus and they
[57:51] would walk seven hours to get to this
[57:53] church this has been a labor of love for
[57:57] years and so these people they now that
[58:00] they've come to this they can really
[58:03] appreciate what was
[58:06] to now what is and so they don't take
[58:08] for granted what they have you can tell
[58:11] that the people they really sacrifice
[58:14] and they really want something from God
[58:17] and so this pastor here is just giving
[58:20] his all and not only is he shepherding
[58:22] he's he you know he helps with the the
[58:25] brothers to teach them and they also go
[58:27] out so not only is is brother Malachi
[58:30] going out and trying to establish like
[58:33] they don't even know this is the word of
[58:35] God so he has to teach them very basic
[58:37] things like this is God's word this is
[58:40] his promise to learn how to reverence it
[58:42] they don't even understand these people
[58:44] are in the bush they can't read and so
[58:46] he has to take time tediously going
[58:49] through laboring laboring laboring start
[58:52] at the very Basics and yet they have to
[58:55] stay there in labor and so this was very
[58:58] profound and thought provoking for me so
[59:00] I just wanted to lay that in there
[59:02] before we moved on go ahead you're doing
[59:03] very good
[59:05] say those details to me are common
[59:09] so um
[59:13] but it's very true
[59:15] you know when when you're
[59:18] when you're living in those conditions
[59:20] it really takes the love of God to be
[59:22] able to just long for The Fellowship of
[59:24] the word and so you can see the labor of
[59:27] love and and brother Malachi's Ministry
[59:30] and so this is the congregation
[59:33] that they have there you know there is
[59:36] and this and this picture here that we
[59:38] have
[59:39] just down the street there's a Maasai
[59:42] Church which is a I believe it was kind
[59:44] of a Pentecostal Maasai church and so
[59:47] brother Malachi I just felt the love and
[59:49] invited them to come in through
[59:52] and sat in the services that we had here
[59:54] on Wednesday
[59:56] so this was a
[59:59] picture of the congregation this is all
[1:00:02] of them here together in front of the
[1:00:04] building
[1:00:10] that's brother Malachi he's he's the
[1:00:13] pastor there
[1:00:16] that's brother Andrew so forget about
[1:00:19] that guy but then um brother Malachi
[1:00:22] actually
[1:00:23] um his father was a tribal leader and so
[1:00:26] he had multiple wives this is the thing
[1:00:28] that the word of God does for them
[1:00:29] that's a little bit different than what
[1:00:31] we would probably be accustomed to so
[1:00:34] the Lord really dealt with him and then
[1:00:37] from him like his brother has now come
[1:00:40] out and is serving the lord under the
[1:00:43] the message of the hour and then also I
[1:00:46] believe there's like 27 people from his
[1:00:49] family that her the father had three
[1:00:51] wives and just a branch of uh you know
[1:00:54] if you have cattle you have wives there
[1:00:56] it's just different and so it's really
[1:01:00] amazing how God this message even can
[1:01:03] take the Clutter of our Humanity all of
[1:01:06] the the deception all of the confusion
[1:01:08] and it pulls people out it calls them
[1:01:11] out of the man's thinking it calls him
[1:01:13] out of religion and it brings them to a
[1:01:16] Life of Christ and so I was really
[1:01:19] struck by his testimony because he
[1:01:22] really is humble he loves the Lord he's
[1:01:24] a true servant
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:29] and then we got fed
[1:01:32] we ate it all we ate it all just the
[1:01:35] beginning
[1:01:36] they had meetings this was meetings for
[1:01:38] them so
[1:01:39] um
[1:01:40] I don't ever turn down food and so we we
[1:01:43] ate and we ate really good
[1:01:47] you know the people of Tanzania really
[1:01:49] love
[1:01:50] they they the Believers there they're
[1:01:52] just so loving
[1:01:54] we we really were received with open
[1:01:56] arms
[1:01:57] and you know
[1:01:59] um
[1:02:00] if you get to know one another and you
[1:02:02] just sit there and even if you don't get
[1:02:04] to speak the same language it's it's
[1:02:06] just a love language between the way
[1:02:08] that you act with one another that shows
[1:02:10] your sons
[1:02:12] you know you believe the same message
[1:02:14] you produces the same fruit it produces
[1:02:17] the Same Love
[1:02:20] yes brother Elias is in the middle
[1:02:24] but the Malachi is to the right
[1:02:28] I want to say this also about that first
[1:02:31] service brother Cosman brother Adrian
[1:02:33] ended up speaking but there was a few
[1:02:35] people that had a real urgent need and
[1:02:37] so we were able to visit with them and
[1:02:40] the Lord really met him in a
[1:02:42] supernatural way so there was victory in
[1:02:44] the camp that picture with all of us
[1:02:46] together at the end I believe it's
[1:02:48] largely because there's people that are
[1:02:50] burdened and their faith and love is
[1:02:52] going to work in prayer even from here
[1:02:54] they were praying the Lord really moved
[1:02:57] in a special way and so in this in this
[1:03:01] little time of Fellowship just two
[1:03:03] services and we were gone but God really
[1:03:05] blessed the people and so we were
[1:03:07] encouraged our little our little Mustard
[1:03:10] Seed Faith and God really came down he
[1:03:14] moved in a way that I believe that
[1:03:15] people grabbed the word of God and they
[1:03:17] were changed and it made a difference
[1:03:22] so on the second the second church that
[1:03:24] we ended up visiting was uh
[1:03:26] uh
[1:03:28] uh go ahead brother go ahead you're
[1:03:30] doing good brother
[1:03:31] he does so much better but you can't
[1:03:34] even say his name come on try it please
[1:03:36] help me
[1:03:39] nope
[1:03:41] sorry okay
[1:03:45] so the second church was in marourani
[1:03:47] Tanzania
[1:03:48] the pastor here is Pastor Lawrence
[1:03:52] wonderful brother
[1:03:55] these were the services on Thursday but
[1:03:58] the Andrew ended up taking this one
[1:04:00] and so this was the church where we
[1:04:06] found it
[1:04:08] this location was very tough to get to
[1:04:11] roads were really tight and it was
[1:04:14] really sandy roads
[1:04:17] and and the roads really do beat you up
[1:04:19] like the way you I mean it's just tough
[1:04:23] you know
[1:04:26] you um
[1:04:27] get tired
[1:04:29] this is a video here
[1:04:36] you can see the surroundings it's just
[1:04:38] in the middle of nowhere
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:53] so I just took a quick video because I
[1:04:56] was I was in another world just blown
[1:04:59] away and so I was really excited the
[1:05:01] president's Lord already was dealing
[1:05:02] with me and oh here I am getting ready
[1:05:10] the expectation I go to college they
[1:05:13] were ready for the word
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:29] they really like to sing
[1:05:33] this was the congregation
[1:05:36] um
[1:05:38] and they stayed they stayed in between
[1:05:39] church services there was a church
[1:05:42] service at 10 o'clock in the morning
[1:05:44] and then
[1:05:46] I think we got out at maybe 12 31 and
[1:05:49] then the second one was around three
[1:05:51] o'clock 3 30. and so people will just
[1:05:55] so if I could say this about no that's
[1:05:58] fine so what they did is they took the
[1:06:00] church pews and they put them under a
[1:06:02] tree that was their Fellowship Hall and
[1:06:04] so I was like praise God they got a
[1:06:05] fellowship hall and it was nice under
[1:06:07] the shade you in the sun you sweating
[1:06:10] but uh it was really amazing after the
[1:06:13] first service this one dear solar name
[1:06:15] was hope and she had been teetering and
[1:06:19] the message really spoke to her because
[1:06:21] I what I spoke on is is you know why
[1:06:23] halt between two opinions and she made
[1:06:25] the decision she came forward and really
[1:06:27] said I'm I'm determined now I'm making
[1:06:30] my choice and so she was really touched
[1:06:33] by that she was the only person that
[1:06:34] came up after the service and so but but
[1:06:38] I thought it was real special she ended
[1:06:40] up with her whole countenance she was
[1:06:42] just beaming with joy and I know that
[1:06:45] the Lord really undertook for her so
[1:06:50] and this brother
[1:06:52] um he also this brother so he he he's
[1:06:58] been going out he's been one of the
[1:07:01] Troopers that are just going out into
[1:07:02] the bush and he's giving everything and
[1:07:04] anything that he can and he's in a
[1:07:07] little bit of a financial straight but
[1:07:09] the Lord really gave him a word and so
[1:07:11] he was just I mean we just couldn't let
[1:07:14] go of one another he was so happy and
[1:07:16] the Lord really really blessed him so
[1:07:19] these are the fruits of your labor as
[1:07:22] well so we're you know when one gets to
[1:07:24] Victory we all get the victory you know
[1:07:26] so we're a body and so I just want a
[1:07:28] fellowship with you what God did
[1:07:31] as we were there and so it makes so much
[1:07:33] so much of a difference they're
[1:07:35] encouraged and so uh
[1:07:38] this is the pastor here on this next
[1:07:40] slide we probably pick it up a little
[1:07:41] bit I don't want to labor too long but
[1:07:43] this is the pastor Lawrence am I saying
[1:07:46] that right yes and so and so they just
[1:07:50] really humble brother doesn't have much
[1:07:52] but really is giving is all and he also
[1:07:55] he was really uh privileged and felt
[1:07:58] privileged to have us come to his home
[1:08:00] and when we when we left after the
[1:08:03] service and he they invited us to come
[1:08:05] and have some fellowship some lunch at
[1:08:07] their home and and uh one brother his
[1:08:09] name was brother good luck and so I was
[1:08:11] like Wow praise God brother good luck
[1:08:13] I'm like this is amazing I'm home you
[1:08:17] know and so when I got out of the truck
[1:08:19] you know uh the thing is when you walk
[1:08:22] there there's not there's not a whole
[1:08:23] lot of pre-made sidewalks I seen one guy
[1:08:26] with the broom we might show the picture
[1:08:27] later but he was brooming dirt I'm like
[1:08:30] he's brooming the path that's a dirt
[1:08:33] path and he's brooming dirt and so I
[1:08:35] just you know things just don't make
[1:08:37] sense sometimes because you're just not
[1:08:39] used to it you know and so but the one
[1:08:41] brother came up to me and he had his uh
[1:08:43] towel and he's like Dusty my he's
[1:08:45] dusting my pants off and I'm like ah
[1:08:49] this is what it really means to be a
[1:08:51] servant this is what it really means to
[1:08:53] be foot washing I mean he's he's I mean
[1:08:55] at the travel and this brother he wants
[1:08:58] to he wants to take your books he wants
[1:09:00] to take your he wants to take the load
[1:09:02] off of you he's trying to you know help
[1:09:04] do something isn't that what we want to
[1:09:06] do we just want to do something
[1:09:07] for God and his people and so it really
[1:09:10] touched my heart uh that that brother
[1:09:13] good luck was and uh yeah so
[1:09:17] and then the food was amazing the
[1:09:19] mangoes and
[1:09:25] go ahead brother yeah but David warned
[1:09:28] me through a Texas at mangoes and
[1:09:30] pineapples
[1:09:31] and that's what we went for avocados and
[1:09:34] avocados and cucumbers
[1:09:37] and so the again the such a love
[1:09:41] this this was on Friday we went to
[1:09:43] namanga
[1:09:47] Pastor here's brother Jeremy
[1:09:51] and this this brother his name is Elias
[1:09:55] also and this brother lost his wife he's
[1:09:57] also a minister he's been going out and
[1:10:00] he's now pastoring another church he was
[1:10:02] under brother Jeremiah and working with
[1:10:04] him the pastor that's been pastoring at
[1:10:06] this church they've been there for five
[1:10:08] years and so brother this brother lives
[1:10:12] that I'm standing next to he also is
[1:10:14] burdened with the word and so he's gone
[1:10:17] out in areas that they've witnessed to
[1:10:19] and now he started with two or three and
[1:10:21] now it's come up to nine and so he's
[1:10:23] really given his all to help Shepherd
[1:10:25] them and to have a place where people
[1:10:28] can come out of the Bush come out of the
[1:10:29] Woodworks and and if they're really
[1:10:31] hungry for God so he's laboring for that
[1:10:33] but he did lose his wife and so I think
[1:10:36] that was about four years ago and one
[1:10:38] thing that he asked me to pray about and
[1:10:40] I'll ask you is you know that financial
[1:10:43] burden when his wife got sick he's still
[1:10:46] packing that and he's even married now
[1:10:48] with a small child and so you know I
[1:10:52] believe that just you know he's part of
[1:10:54] our body and if we can take and
[1:10:55] undergird that in prayer I believe God
[1:10:57] could undertake but these brothers he
[1:10:59] helped translate
[1:11:01] the service also in the evening for us
[1:11:03] because brother Elias was interpreting
[1:11:05] most all the services and he was just
[1:11:07] really starting to get wore out so he he
[1:11:10] helped us with the translation
[1:11:13] go ahead brother costume we're going to
[1:11:15] try to run up a little bit
[1:11:16] faster
[1:11:18] yeah that's their building there
[1:11:22] um they had dirt floors
[1:11:26] the building I think that they were in
[1:11:28] was just really just simple and
[1:11:33] this is a
[1:11:34] a video
[1:11:43] so the man walking with his son his
[1:11:46] name's Reuben and that was his second
[1:11:48] time visiting the church someone had
[1:11:50] invited him this was the second time I
[1:11:52] believe it was his first time bringing
[1:11:53] his son
[1:11:54] but I was going to minister I believe
[1:11:57] this yeah this was this was the service
[1:12:00] that I was ministering and at the end of
[1:12:03] it he came up and he gave his heart to
[1:12:05] the Lord he was very hardened and the
[1:12:07] the whatever circumstances that he was
[1:12:10] in he was broken and he had that that
[1:12:13] real dog fight like you ain't gonna
[1:12:15] stare me down I'm gonna win this but the
[1:12:18] Lord really started melting his heart
[1:12:20] and they really dealt with him and I
[1:12:22] believe that he really was changed and
[1:12:25] so
[1:12:27] um if you can go to the next
[1:12:29] you can play
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:42] this is a picture of their
[1:12:45] this was after everything was done and
[1:12:47] we were all happy and rejoicing but it
[1:12:50] was hard because now it's time to say
[1:12:51] goodbye this is Brother Jeremiah and
[1:12:54] he's the pastor there like I said he'd
[1:12:55] been serving as Pastor there five years
[1:12:57] and one thing that was very pronounced
[1:13:01] to me that when we turned the service
[1:13:02] over to him he wanted to communicate
[1:13:05] something because most of the time after
[1:13:07] we turned the service they were speaking
[1:13:09] Swahili and so we didn't really
[1:13:10] understand anything they said afterwards
[1:13:12] because no one will start bringing back
[1:13:14] to English to us but he stopped and he
[1:13:16] asked the brother to come up and he said
[1:13:18] and he testified he said what was
[1:13:20] preached today saved us 40 Years of
[1:13:23] confusion so I'm just saying what he
[1:13:26] said and you know what this word this
[1:13:29] message clears the confusion if it's
[1:13:31] preached under inspiration by the Holy
[1:13:34] Ghost God changes lives he clears the
[1:13:37] confusion this message is the truth amen
[1:13:41] It cast out the darkness and so
[1:13:45] there's another young man here standing
[1:13:47] with brother Cosman and he too he he was
[1:13:51] tottering between the line but at that
[1:13:53] at this Junction of time he said you
[1:13:56] know what I'm making the decision I'm
[1:13:58] going to the water I'm taking Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ's name in water baptism I'm not
[1:14:02] ashamed he might have been writing the
[1:14:04] church views for years but at this time
[1:14:07] he had made his decision and I could
[1:14:09] really see some boldness rise up in him
[1:14:11] so this man was changed amen
[1:14:14] and then these two sisters this one
[1:14:16] sister to the right yes so the one
[1:14:19] sister to the right she's she was sick
[1:14:21] and she come and she wanted to receive
[1:14:23] healing from God and I just asked her I
[1:14:25] said are you a Christian and she said no
[1:14:27] and I said you know we can have two
[1:14:29] things that we can do for you we can
[1:14:31] pray for you as a sinner or we can pray
[1:14:33] for you that you'll get saved and you
[1:14:35] don't have to worry and she made she
[1:14:37] waited she waited she was like you know
[1:14:39] I just want healing I said you know what
[1:14:41] that's our God he's no respecter of
[1:14:44] persons if you just want God for healing
[1:14:46] if you just want him so you can dodge
[1:14:48] hell he's willing to do it
[1:14:51] he's willing to do it but this sister on
[1:14:53] the other side she's the one I believe
[1:14:55] that invited her friend and she was
[1:14:58] touched by the Lord and so I believe
[1:15:00] that her her love for her friend she's
[1:15:04] on the road
[1:15:05] amen amen so that's a wonderful
[1:15:07] testimony of what the Lord's doing when
[1:15:09] we bear one another's burden that was a
[1:15:12] lost friend she come to the service she
[1:15:14] didn't even know God had a hook for her
[1:15:16] you know Divine Healing is just a bait
[1:15:19] on the hook all right sometimes you go
[1:15:21] and get sick but we're not majoring on a
[1:15:23] minor we're saying you you must be born
[1:15:25] again right so
[1:15:28] this was a wonderful time
[1:15:30] the pastor's office was on the backside
[1:15:34] of the building and uh just really
[1:15:37] really humble just to be able to have
[1:15:40] partake of that meal was they were very
[1:15:42] gracious it was a wonderful treat and
[1:15:45] then when we yeah another thing that
[1:15:47] happened while we were here there was
[1:15:49] he said the tribe but these kind of the
[1:15:52] the the the the kind of uh people that
[1:15:54] that they come in contact with are the
[1:15:57] people that actually still live with in
[1:15:59] the wilderness and the boys raise up and
[1:16:01] to prove their manhood they go out with
[1:16:03] the spear and they go kill a lion
[1:16:06] and then they become like hey this is
[1:16:08] proof that I can lead I go kill a lion
[1:16:11] and so you know the whole bone in the
[1:16:14] nose and the Hoops that stretch out and
[1:16:16] they got all the you know stuff and just
[1:16:18] glitter and all this you know worship to
[1:16:20] these other things but
[1:16:22] but this one sister you can tell that
[1:16:25] she was a Christian but she had the the
[1:16:28] mark of that tribal uh characteristic it
[1:16:32] was a mark on her but when she came up
[1:16:34] those her ears were dangling she didn't
[1:16:36] have any of that jewelry and she'd even
[1:16:39] know she's like ah I don't really need
[1:16:42] prayer for anything God has provided
[1:16:43] everything I've never I need it I don't
[1:16:45] know why I'm here she was smiling and
[1:16:47] beaming and it just dawned on me I said
[1:16:49] sister go and tell people that God he
[1:16:54] meets every need you know sometimes we
[1:16:56] just need instruction sometimes we don't
[1:16:58] just like the brother said about the
[1:17:00] guide sometimes we just need the guy to
[1:17:02] tell us what to do next go into the
[1:17:05] world and testify that God is our
[1:17:07] provider he meets every need
[1:17:10] so I thought praise God he can take
[1:17:13] someone from the bush that had the mark
[1:17:15] and to restore him into a daughter of
[1:17:18] God knowing that it's the same God that
[1:17:20] provides for you the same God that
[1:17:22] provides for me amen
[1:17:27] and this now is uh
[1:17:29] this is Brother alliance's Church they
[1:17:32] they had a previous church building that
[1:17:34] he told us that they actually their old
[1:17:36] building was like this and they built
[1:17:38] the new building around the old building
[1:17:41] I was like wow they saved money on
[1:17:43] scaffolding you could just stand on the
[1:17:46] roof and
[1:17:47] but they were able to still have church
[1:17:49] and so I just it was a head scratcher
[1:17:51] for me but but uh very very beautiful
[1:17:54] church and um and um yeah go ahead
[1:17:58] brother
[1:17:59] this was on the drive there we were just
[1:18:02] the roads are very different
[1:18:16] so we were going to end up having
[1:18:18] services
[1:18:19] Friday night Saturday night Saturday
[1:18:22] night
[1:18:23] you know nothing just Saturday night
[1:18:25] Sunday morning Sunday evening and then
[1:18:27] Tuesday okay what he said
[1:18:32] this is a view from
[1:18:34] the church going out that was their
[1:18:36] little Fellowship
[1:18:38] Hall area where the tent was they were
[1:18:40] just hanging out
[1:18:42] one thing I'll say about being in the
[1:18:44] sun for more than about 15 minutes
[1:18:46] things are very different there they're
[1:18:48] they're using heavy jackets I mean they
[1:18:51] they cover their skin I was my arm got
[1:18:54] sunburned and it's just different there
[1:18:56] so a lot of the people they cover
[1:18:59] themselves and it's hot
[1:19:01] so anyway you notice they're under the
[1:19:04] tree or they're under the Pavilion a lot
[1:19:06] of people ain't just standing around in
[1:19:07] the Sun
[1:19:08] and that's because it's hot
[1:19:13] this is this is one of our favorite
[1:19:14] songs we heard on this trip
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:41] we were worshiping the Lord
[1:19:53] all right
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:20:03] and his brother Elias that's his home
[1:20:06] church he pastures
[1:20:11] and this was like Sunday morning brother
[1:20:13] cosmon took the service on Sunday
[1:20:15] morning
[1:20:18] this is our brother Elias's home I
[1:20:20] believe this was Tuesday evening after
[1:20:22] the
[1:20:23] Tuesday evening service uh brother
[1:20:25] Andrew ended up preaching that one I
[1:20:27] think we were at his house just eating
[1:20:30] and just more food
[1:20:33] this is when we were going to expose to
[1:20:35] get Fufu
[1:20:37] so we were really excited about that so
[1:20:39] on Monday
[1:20:41] um
[1:20:42] so Monday was my anniversary that was
[1:20:44] one of the things that I had to overcome
[1:20:46] but I called my wife was like honey the
[1:20:48] brothers are going to take a day go
[1:20:49] drive three hours somewhere it's going
[1:20:51] to be a safari where they see something
[1:20:53] where there's animals and it's Caldera
[1:20:56] where there was a volcanic eruption that
[1:20:58] collapsed but now it's just a natural
[1:21:00] habitat where these tribal people live
[1:21:03] with these animals it's pretty bizarre
[1:21:05] pretty neat but I was so tired one thing
[1:21:08] that happened for me I think my average
[1:21:10] night of sleep was like two and a half
[1:21:12] hours and I just you know it was three
[1:21:15] flights 26 hours just in the air or 23
[1:21:19] something like that it was really
[1:21:21] physically taxing but so worth it the
[1:21:24] Lord was gracious but I was thinking oh
[1:21:26] if I could just rest I got one more
[1:21:28] service I could just rest never have I
[1:21:30] had preached four services in one week
[1:21:32] so I mean I had a lot to overcome so
[1:21:35] then when I talked to my kids and my
[1:21:36] wife they're like ah you should go you
[1:21:38] never did so when I'm going one of the
[1:21:40] things that as you drive and you start
[1:21:42] going through there they call it an
[1:21:43] African massage
[1:21:45] I mean it's like George rattling and so
[1:21:49] when he first said I thought he said an
[1:21:51] African message I was like
[1:21:54] man I got to talk to this driver some
[1:21:55] more because I ended up it was just real
[1:21:58] Sovereign how the Lord dealt but this is
[1:22:00] uh brother Peter and so I call him
[1:22:03] brother he's just he was a nominal
[1:22:05] person and when a Believer and but when
[1:22:09] we I ended up going and so they were
[1:22:12] waiting for me I was getting some things
[1:22:13] done and so I was the last one and so I
[1:22:15] had the front seat next to him and he
[1:22:17] was standing there and kind of giving an
[1:22:18] introduction where he asked if I would
[1:22:20] oh you know pray for the day and so I
[1:22:23] ended up in the front seat for probably
[1:22:24] the first hour just him and I
[1:22:27] fellowshipping and he was so blessed and
[1:22:30] I was too and at the end of our our trip
[1:22:33] and and while we went out there we had
[1:22:35] such great Fellowship the Lord it was so
[1:22:38] amazing because he says he's been doing
[1:22:40] this 16 years and on the journey he says
[1:22:43] never never not one time has he seen
[1:22:46] Lions through the main path the Lions
[1:22:48] would come way way down in another area
[1:22:50] so not only he said oh look there's
[1:22:52] something ahead and was it the lions
[1:22:54] that came first no it was giraffes he's
[1:22:57] like this is this is this doesn't happen
[1:22:59] he goes your God must be real he's now
[1:23:01] he's testifying to us I'm like so he
[1:23:04] sees giraffes you know and then and then
[1:23:07] we saw zebras and then we saw Lions he
[1:23:09] was like what is going on he goes the
[1:23:11] Safari's over we already could go back
[1:23:13] and we weren't we still had another two
[1:23:15] hours to go and so I just thought you
[1:23:17] know what that's what our God does he
[1:23:20] testifies he gives witness of the Holy
[1:23:23] Ghost so that people can you know what
[1:23:25] this is something to Marvel at this is
[1:23:27] different what we're talking about is
[1:23:29] different this is not the same thing
[1:23:31] that the church world has this is
[1:23:34] something that's alive and real and
[1:23:36] God's vindicating he's coming behind his
[1:23:38] Believers and he'll stand behind you
[1:23:40] when you stand behind this word amen
[1:23:45] this this could be a good part for the
[1:23:47] Trojan to enjoy there's some animals in
[1:23:49] here that brother Andrew took a lot of
[1:23:52] good pictures he's a good photographer
[1:23:56] this is the gorongoro crater but their
[1:23:59] Elias just wanted to bless us with a
[1:24:01] small little trip on our day off
[1:24:03] and so he scheduled this I don't know I
[1:24:06] think uh a few weeks before we got there
[1:24:08] but he's like hey do you enjoy this you
[1:24:11] can rest a little bit and so the drive
[1:24:14] into the crater was about three hours it
[1:24:16] was 160 kilometers and so this was the
[1:24:18] view of the crater before you go in the
[1:24:21] crater and you start looking inside
[1:24:22] where the animals and you know the Lord
[1:24:25] really blessed me with this
[1:24:27] because
[1:24:29] you know
[1:24:30] we see God in nature
[1:24:33] we see his Redemption plan of what he's
[1:24:36] created in nature because that's who he
[1:24:39] is that's his nature that's what he does
[1:24:41] his life
[1:24:43] you know you can tell a tree by the way
[1:24:46] grows and all these things in the grass
[1:24:48] and just a just the beauty of his
[1:24:50] creation and so this really spoke to me
[1:24:54] very deeply and and I was blessed from
[1:24:56] that perspective
[1:24:58] this is a group of Maasai on the side of
[1:25:01] the road
[1:25:03] um
[1:25:04] these tribes the the government is
[1:25:06] actually starting to sponsor those who
[1:25:08] are willing to leave that land and
[1:25:11] they're providing shelter in different
[1:25:12] areas because they don't really this has
[1:25:15] become such a tourist place that they
[1:25:17] you know people kind of get alarmed with
[1:25:19] the guy with the spear and a machete you
[1:25:21] know
[1:25:22] and they they have they feel and the the
[1:25:25] guide was telling us that they feel that
[1:25:27] the cattle whether it's on your land
[1:25:29] whether it came from your cow or any of
[1:25:31] that it's theirs
[1:25:32] they were given cattle and so they'll
[1:25:36] just take it and then they'll they'll go
[1:25:38] to Arms with you and so you know from
[1:25:41] that standpoint a lot of them they're
[1:25:43] still there
[1:25:44] and Uh something's so profound and I'll
[1:25:47] just stop here for just a second
[1:25:49] something's so profound happened to me
[1:25:52] while I was there and and it's giving me
[1:25:54] a message but there was a man that was
[1:25:57] one of these men that live out in the
[1:26:01] jungle
[1:26:02] and he had a spear in one hand and a
[1:26:05] cell phone in the other
[1:26:07] you gave me a message so if the Lord
[1:26:11] permit I want to share that with you so
[1:26:15] you know we're living in a blending time
[1:26:18] so but anyway that's that's for later
[1:26:21] Lord willing
[1:26:28] this is um the African Buffalo I believe
[1:26:34] the Bison
[1:26:37] beautiful beautiful you know beautiful
[1:26:40] scenery it was
[1:26:41] Tanzania is really a good looking
[1:26:44] country
[1:26:54] really nice
[1:26:55] there's the zebras
[1:26:59] are the kids enjoying these like this
[1:27:02] I took a video for you too here's the
[1:27:05] one right here
[1:27:12] yes
[1:27:21] you know it's so peaceful when man does
[1:27:23] not disturb the creation of God
[1:27:26] you know when he goes in and perverts it
[1:27:28] and try to do his own thing and
[1:27:31] and then you realize otherwise it's just
[1:27:33] peaceful there's just
[1:27:36] um
[1:27:37] this was the end of the crater where we
[1:27:40] stopped and I took that picture
[1:27:43] it really spoke to me
[1:27:45] because
[1:27:47] you see it's a very beautiful tree it's
[1:27:50] planted by the water
[1:27:53] you know it's providing shade
[1:27:56] it's got a bunch of rocks in it
[1:28:00] it's got a lot of Revelation
[1:28:04] um
[1:28:05] there's a big one right here to the left
[1:28:08] but you know that's
[1:28:10] that's the creation of God
[1:28:15] brother Branham says this and we'll just
[1:28:17] kind of close this portion here slowly
[1:28:18] but
[1:28:20] brother bam says this it says and then
[1:28:22] you take a tree
[1:28:24] it says take a tree it reflects the tree
[1:28:27] of life which is in heaven
[1:28:31] the Tree of Life something that he gave
[1:28:34] us an image of that we can look and say
[1:28:36] you know Lord
[1:28:39] a tree of life it says all these things
[1:28:41] are struggling for perfection
[1:28:44] and everything in the natural
[1:28:47] as Hebrew says here was made of things
[1:28:50] which do not appear it says in other
[1:28:53] words they are Supernatural
[1:28:56] and the Supernatural is reflecting the
[1:29:00] natural see
[1:29:01] now then the natural was eternal
[1:29:05] the natural was eternal
[1:29:10] or is to be Everlasting with the
[1:29:12] supernatural but sin
[1:29:15] unbelief
[1:29:17] perverted the natural
[1:29:20] and it says and so and if that is so
[1:29:23] which I believe it is this is the
[1:29:25] prophet saying it it says then
[1:29:27] everything that's happening on Earth is
[1:29:29] a type of spiritual things happening see
[1:29:33] and so a Son of God is led by the spirit
[1:29:37] of God by the spirit of Truth
[1:29:40] and for me personally I I don't want to
[1:29:43] be too spiritual but you know I think
[1:29:45] expectation is good
[1:29:47] because if we have expectation now he
[1:29:50] can walk us into the footsteps of the
[1:29:52] word if we're walking the footsteps of
[1:29:54] Jesus we know Jesus is the word and so
[1:29:57] if he goes before us if he if his word
[1:30:00] goes before us then we know
[1:30:03] we're following the right direction
[1:30:07] this is Tuesday brother Andrew took the
[1:30:09] last service
[1:30:12] I believe
[1:30:15] but but Andrew's got a testimony brother
[1:30:17] Jerome here
[1:30:19] you know it isn't God good
[1:30:22] you know to be able to give us a part in
[1:30:25] Redemption you know he said go into all
[1:30:28] the world
[1:30:29] and preach the gospel and he put us on
[1:30:32] he put us on uh
[1:30:35] how do they say it you're you're you're
[1:30:37] you're
[1:30:38] a joint heirs with Christ and this this
[1:30:42] um one thing as we kind of close the
[1:30:46] testimony and the mission trip
[1:30:49] I want to say this you never know what
[1:30:52] God has in mind until sometimes you're
[1:30:56] in it
[1:30:57] and so the thing that I I want to say is
[1:31:01] is uh maybe if
[1:31:03] if we can just take maybe about five or
[1:31:06] ten minutes I want to share a burden
[1:31:07] with you from my heart and if I could
[1:31:10] just have you consider something and
[1:31:13] it's out of uh your Bible if you want to
[1:31:16] turn with me I just I'll just share this
[1:31:18] from the standpoint of
[1:31:22] what the Lord spoke to my heart that I
[1:31:24] feel like complements what our pastor
[1:31:26] was saying out of
[1:31:29] John 17 but over in the book of First
[1:31:33] Peter
[1:31:34] the third chapter
[1:31:40] and if I forget now
[1:31:43] please be in prayer for brother Otis
[1:31:46] um
[1:31:47] he is he is a warrior and he is fighting
[1:31:51] and so we just trust that he'll be back
[1:31:53] in the house of the Lord worshiping the
[1:31:55] Lord and overcoming all obstacles
[1:31:59] so in First Peter chapter 3
[1:32:03] in verse 1 it says likewise ye wives be
[1:32:07] in subjection to your own husbands that
[1:32:10] if any obey not the word they also
[1:32:13] without the word be won by the
[1:32:16] conversation of the wives while they
[1:32:19] behold your Chase conversation coupled
[1:32:22] with fear and then if we skip down if we
[1:32:26] could read there in verse
[1:32:30] 10 says for he that will love life and
[1:32:33] see good days let him refrain his tongue
[1:32:36] from evil and his lips from speaking no
[1:32:39] guile
[1:32:40] let him assure evil and do good let him
[1:32:43] seek peace and ensue it
[1:32:46] for the eyes of the Lord are over the
[1:32:48] righteous and his ears are open unto
[1:32:51] their prayers but the face of the Lord
[1:32:53] is against them that do evil
[1:32:56] who is he that will harm you
[1:32:59] if ye be followers of that which is good
[1:33:04] but and if ye suffered for righteousness
[1:33:07] sake happy are ye and be not afraid of
[1:33:11] their Terror neither be troubled but
[1:33:15] sanctify the Lord God in your heart and
[1:33:19] be ready always to give an answer to the
[1:33:22] to every man that asks you for the
[1:33:25] reason of the hope that is in you with
[1:33:29] meekness and fear having a good
[1:33:32] conscience that whereas they speak evil
[1:33:35] of you as a evil doers
[1:33:38] they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
[1:33:41] your good conversation in Christ for it
[1:33:44] is better if the will of God be so that
[1:33:47] ye suffer doing well
[1:33:50] for doing
[1:33:51] for then for evil doing
[1:33:55] and so I would encourage you to read the
[1:33:57] entire chapter but something the Lord
[1:33:59] spoke to my heart and and I didn't
[1:34:01] understand it but
[1:34:03] it was just the phrase be ready always
[1:34:07] you know as we're journeying in the last
[1:34:10] stretch of this road as the scripture
[1:34:13] has admonished us to be ready always you
[1:34:17] know America needs missionaries more
[1:34:19] than anywhere in the world people who
[1:34:22] actually live by the word of God not
[1:34:26] just by a Creed not just by a concept
[1:34:28] but by a new birth experience led into
[1:34:31] the storehouse spiritual food and due
[1:34:34] season where Christ is living in a
[1:34:36] people not human beings taking on
[1:34:39] Concepts but God himself living out his
[1:34:42] life the admonition that I would say is
[1:34:45] just like was said here and you know
[1:34:47] Peter he knew what it was like you know
[1:34:51] Peter came to a place where he said who
[1:34:54] do men say I the son of man am and Peter
[1:34:56] got this great Revelation he said Thou
[1:34:58] Art the Christ see his his mouth had
[1:35:00] spoken some things but immediately he
[1:35:03] turned and he said this plan that's
[1:35:06] going to be for my king my Messiah be it
[1:35:09] far from me and all of a sudden Jesus is
[1:35:12] saying get thee behind me Satan so Peter
[1:35:14] knows a little bit about what he's
[1:35:16] talking about here you know there's
[1:35:18] something that happens sometimes in life
[1:35:20] where you might say some things and the
[1:35:22] word of God comes and corrects us but
[1:35:25] that doesn't change that you're a son or
[1:35:26] a daughter of God it just means God's
[1:35:28] bringing us somewhere God's showing us
[1:35:31] something and so as we're going forward
[1:35:33] we're looking and we're saying now I
[1:35:35] want to be ready always what is it
[1:35:37] saying he's saying but sanctify the Lord
[1:35:40] God in your heart and I thought what
[1:35:42] what are you trying to say because the
[1:35:45] the scripture says in John 17 he says
[1:35:47] thy sanctify them through Thy word and
[1:35:51] see I'm I'm I am such in a place in my
[1:35:54] life and I know you are I want to be
[1:35:56] free in the spirit I want the word of
[1:35:58] God to shine forth I don't want my bad
[1:36:00] attitude I don't want something of my
[1:36:02] mistakes of yesterday to affect my today
[1:36:05] because there's a world that I am living
[1:36:07] out every day I'm making contact I want
[1:36:10] to sanctify the Lord God in my heart God
[1:36:13] has made his Abode in my heart
[1:36:15] God has come in he's cleansed me amen he
[1:36:18] showed me that I'm not just this bag of
[1:36:20] bones I'm not just my mind when I think
[1:36:23] about it but I'm the thought of God
[1:36:25] manifested just like you are you were in
[1:36:28] the back part of God's mind and you've
[1:36:31] come here to be tested come here to be
[1:36:33] tried come here to face difficulties
[1:36:36] and yet not speak guile not to revile
[1:36:40] when someone reviles you but you can
[1:36:42] hold your peace because there's a God in
[1:36:44] your heart there's somebody who
[1:36:46] Sanctified you with the blood
[1:36:48] amen amen sanctify the Lord God in your
[1:36:52] heart
[1:36:53] and be ready be ready
[1:36:57] see what God is trying to teach us teach
[1:37:00] me is you know what I want to be ready
[1:37:04] always he said I'll be with you and in
[1:37:07] you always even till the end
[1:37:11] this is not just sometimes this is
[1:37:14] always he's an ever-present help in a
[1:37:18] time of trouble it's the I am walking
[1:37:20] with us
[1:37:21] we're walking with him hand in hand
[1:37:24] amen amen amen so we want to sanctify
[1:37:28] the Lord God in our heart and be ready
[1:37:30] always not just to say anything but now
[1:37:34] he's saying for what reason
[1:37:37] he said
[1:37:39] be ready to give an answer
[1:37:42] well we got answers for a lot of things
[1:37:44] we got an answer for why the government
[1:37:46] does this and why our boss did that and
[1:37:49] why our daughter did that and why my mom
[1:37:51] did that we got answers for all kinds of
[1:37:53] stuff but the Bible's saying give an
[1:37:55] answer of the hope
[1:37:56] that's in you what is the hope that's in
[1:37:59] you I didn't choose God God chose you
[1:38:03] God chose me
[1:38:05] this is not some kind of workup your
[1:38:08] name was on a book before this world
[1:38:10] ever came to pass before it was ever
[1:38:12] here in existence and you're only here
[1:38:15] to manifest God
[1:38:17] in that wonderful be ready always be
[1:38:20] Sanctified it's God speaking through
[1:38:23] human lips
[1:38:24] when you speak this word with the spirit
[1:38:27] of God in you it's God speaking
[1:38:30] sanctify the Lord God in your heart and
[1:38:33] be ready to give an answer to every man
[1:38:36] what the hope that you have amen
[1:38:39] I'm not angry I'm happy
[1:38:51] give it to every man
[1:38:52] not just some men
[1:38:54] every man
[1:38:56] be willing
[1:38:57] God wants to use your testimony
[1:39:05] but we want to do it in meekness and in
[1:39:07] fear you know when you really catch the
[1:39:11] revelation
[1:39:13] that you're a part of God
[1:39:15] you're not just the sum and substance of
[1:39:17] your flesh your memory
[1:39:20] your reasonings your imaginations your
[1:39:23] conscience
[1:39:25] you're you're you're outside man
[1:39:28] it don't believe
[1:39:30] you're inside man is really confused
[1:39:34] your memory it tells you
[1:39:36] it's a make-believer
[1:39:39] but when your soul is converted it's a
[1:39:41] real believer
[1:39:53] Lord help me
[1:39:55] you know it's just so special that we
[1:39:58] can do what the word said do
[1:40:00] because you're the word
[1:40:02] you have the potentials to express what
[1:40:05] we're speaking on but having a good
[1:40:08] conscience
[1:40:09] and this is the thing just like what was
[1:40:11] said you know Jesus when he was reviled
[1:40:14] you know
[1:40:16] he Sanctified himself
[1:40:19] he showed us a way
[1:40:21] you know he said if someone comes to you
[1:40:23] and he smites you on the cheek you have
[1:40:26] it in you
[1:40:28] to turn the cheek
[1:40:31] we don't have to defend ourselves
[1:40:33] because we have a great defender
[1:40:37] and sometimes I believe that
[1:40:39] if we'll just wait
[1:40:41] God wants to reveal something a quality
[1:40:44] of himself in us and through us
[1:40:47] I just feel like I I have more than what
[1:40:50] I have time for
[1:40:52] maybe just
[1:40:55] I don't know how to transition but you
[1:40:56] know something that you know was on my
[1:41:00] heart to share you know this this you
[1:41:03] know the church is a type of of uh of a
[1:41:06] woman and I believe Peter is expressing
[1:41:09] here something that
[1:41:11] you know has a spiritual you know
[1:41:14] brother Branham said this nature this
[1:41:17] flesh we were married to it and this is
[1:41:19] like a husband this flesh and so even in
[1:41:23] this scripture if you take the type and
[1:41:25] you realize we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:41:28] Christ you know and this flesh it's
[1:41:32] going to be won by a chaste conversation
[1:41:35] see the scripture says in First Peter in
[1:41:38] in First Peter chapter 3 says likewise
[1:41:40] women and this is also dealing with the
[1:41:42] natural course but
[1:41:45] if you see the subjection to our own
[1:41:48] husband
[1:41:50] we're subject to our husband which is
[1:41:53] the revealed word of the hour and he
[1:41:55] says if any obey not the word
[1:41:58] he can maybe won by the chase
[1:42:00] conversation
[1:42:02] you know this Inside Man is the one
[1:42:04] that's getting the victory that's
[1:42:06] causing this out man outside man to come
[1:42:08] subject
[1:42:10] it must come subject
[1:42:13] amen but we want to fight from the
[1:42:15] inside not from the outside
[1:42:20] and it says this in in verse 3 says
[1:42:23] who's adorning let it not be outward we
[1:42:27] don't want it to be outward we don't
[1:42:28] want religion we want God
[1:42:31] on the inside
[1:42:34] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:42:37] heart in that which is not corruptable
[1:42:40] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:42:43] Spirit which in the sight of God is a
[1:42:46] great price amen amen I just
[1:42:50] maybe I'll just
[1:42:54] take just a little bit of a
[1:42:57] you know I want to encourage you you
[1:42:58] know something in the dietary Church age
[1:43:00] and I'll just try to read a quote and
[1:43:03] just close because I feel like I can go
[1:43:05] way too long and we've already been here
[1:43:07] for a while but I really want to share
[1:43:10] this with you you know the thyatarian
[1:43:12] was a dominating female and so in this
[1:43:16] age the the admonition came in
[1:43:18] Revelations chapter 2 and verse 19 I
[1:43:22] believe it was or or 18.
[1:43:25] but
[1:43:26] you know
[1:43:28] we want to always be ready from the
[1:43:30] standpoint of being servants
[1:43:32] you know part of our commission you know
[1:43:36] we're here on Earth because we've been
[1:43:39] created by Christ Jesus to be here to
[1:43:43] show forth his workmanship we are his
[1:43:46] workmanship
[1:43:48] don't don't think oh well because I
[1:43:50] don't go to Africa where I don't go to
[1:43:52] China or if I don't go to Mexico if I
[1:43:54] don't know you right now can fulfill the
[1:43:57] commission
[1:43:58] you can go into your world
[1:44:01] you can display God to a world that's
[1:44:06] either going to receive your testimony
[1:44:08] and it's going to change them or they're
[1:44:09] going to look at you and say fanaticism
[1:44:11] there's no way that's God and it brings
[1:44:14] about a fulfillment
[1:44:16] so I I say this let's not worry about
[1:44:19] the
[1:44:21] what other people decide but let's play
[1:44:24] our part
[1:44:25] you know and in this dietary Church age
[1:44:28] where there was this church that it was
[1:44:31] a a dominating female
[1:44:33] this is um
[1:44:35] it says I know your service Jesus said
[1:44:40] he is the greatest of all
[1:44:44] he that is greatest of all servant to
[1:44:47] all
[1:44:48] and a wise man commended on this saying
[1:44:52] here's what he said only history would
[1:44:56] prove the truth of this
[1:45:00] that word
[1:45:04] daikum
[1:45:06] that man was right that man was right
[1:45:08] and all truly great men in history have
[1:45:12] been servants those who demand to be
[1:45:15] served they who oppressed they who
[1:45:18] sought to always be the head have gone
[1:45:21] down in shame even the very rich are
[1:45:24] condemned by God when they use when they
[1:45:27] have not used their wealth right but
[1:45:30] look into history and you will find that
[1:45:32] truly the great were those who served
[1:45:34] others history can never Acclaim
[1:45:38] those who
[1:45:40] much was done but it forever will praise
[1:45:44] those who did much for others now let us
[1:45:47] apply that to ourselves even the son of
[1:45:50] man came not to be ministered unto but
[1:45:53] to minister so we are to follow hit that
[1:45:57] example see him as he bowed himself over
[1:46:00] the feet of his Apostles and washed
[1:46:02] their tired dirty feet he was he's he
[1:46:07] said you don't know what I'm doing
[1:46:10] but you will know Hereafter but what you
[1:46:13] see me doing you ought to do
[1:46:17] you also ought to do
[1:46:19] he became a servant in order that God
[1:46:23] could Elevate him to the highest Heights
[1:46:27] amen and one day in Judgment of the
[1:46:30] Saints we are going to hear him say Well
[1:46:35] done
[1:46:36] good and faithful servant
[1:46:39] enter into the joys of the Lord and it
[1:46:42] is hard to always be a servant
[1:46:47] but those who are spent
[1:46:49] those who spend and are spent for others
[1:46:52] will one day be seated with him in his
[1:46:57] throne
[1:46:58] aren't you grateful this is plain
[1:47:01] language
[1:47:02] let the word of God interpret it by
[1:47:05] letting it come to pass in our lives to
[1:47:07] take the humble road to take the meek I
[1:47:10] honor my king he's making his Abode he's
[1:47:14] teaching me how to be a servant
[1:47:16] to not fear what man can say not fear
[1:47:20] the accusations of the this that and the
[1:47:24] other the accuser of the brethren
[1:47:26] we are not Divided We Are One
[1:47:30] one in heart one in purpose I'm going to
[1:47:33] serve God even if in my death I'm going
[1:47:36] to bring
[1:47:37] Praises up to his name because he's my
[1:47:40] healer
[1:47:41] I know my redeemer liveth
[1:47:44] amen you willing to do that
[1:47:47] amen I believe you are
[1:47:54] it's it's it is hard to be always a
[1:47:57] servant but those who've been and been
[1:48:02] for others one day will be seated with
[1:48:05] it
[1:48:06] it will be worth it all
[1:48:08] then let us labor for the master for the
[1:48:11] Dawn Till the Setting Sun
[1:48:14] and let us talk of all his wondrous love
[1:48:16] and care
[1:48:17] and when life's all over and all the
[1:48:19] work on Earth is done and the roles up
[1:48:21] come will be Called Up Yonder and I know
[1:48:25] that I really wanted to go through and
[1:48:27] try to read a little bit more but I
[1:48:30] encourage you to take your church age
[1:48:32] book let God speak to you you know
[1:48:35] there's there's spiritual food and I
[1:48:37] know that you do but if you could just
[1:48:39] take that and just with what God placed
[1:48:42] on my heart let him break it even more
[1:48:44] wide open you know I'm just a man but I
[1:48:47] I know that God he spoke to my heart and
[1:48:50] I believe that was for this service so I
[1:48:52] trust the Lord has blessed you and maybe
[1:48:54] as we
[1:48:56] wouldn't stand we can just maybe sing
[1:48:59] only believe as we would turn the
[1:49:01] service back over to our pastor and if
[1:49:04] we just in preparations for singing that
[1:49:07] song If you want to Bow your heart
[1:49:09] before the Lord tonight
[1:49:12] and you just you want to say God you
[1:49:15] spoke to my heart and I really want to
[1:49:17] give all to serve you and to forsake all
[1:49:20] others you're my husband and I may be
[1:49:23] dancing around
[1:49:25] partially in the world or whatever you
[1:49:28] know your heart and you know your
[1:49:30] situation your relationship with the
[1:49:32] Lord but if you from an honest sincere
[1:49:34] heart you want to lift your hand not to
[1:49:36] me but to God and say God I want to
[1:49:39] serve you all my days with everything

[1:49:49] me to what you want me to be let's pray

[1:49:54] thank you for this wonderful privilege
[1:49:56] you've given to us Lord we surely desire
[1:49:59] oh God that the love that we experienced
[1:50:02] in Africa from the Believers that
[1:50:04] receive the word and received us with
[1:50:07] such joy and Thanksgiving and peace Lord
[1:50:10] that the people oh God your children
[1:50:12] here Lord can know that their labor of
[1:50:15] love and their prayers and their
[1:50:16] resources and all that they sacrifice
[1:50:18] that we could go and to be a blessing
[1:50:21] and be blessed Lord I pray that you
[1:50:24] would impart to them over reward Lord I
[1:50:26] pray that you would give them abundant

[1:50:31] is the greatest hour that for a
[1:50:33] Christian to to be here in Satan's Eden
[1:50:36] and to be called out and to shine forth
[1:50:39] this glorious gospel father I'm asking
[1:50:41] that you would encourage the hearts here
[1:50:43] that have been pricked and touched Lord
[1:50:45] may they go past all the barriers of
[1:50:48] yesterday may they go past all the
[1:50:50] barriers of their own humanity and look
[1:50:52] to the inside where Christ is making his
[1:50:54] Abode in their heart may they take
[1:50:57] courage Lord may they go into the
[1:50:58] storehouse may you speak to him to each
[1:51:01] one and help them Lord to overcome oh

[1:51:28] thank you let's sing this together
[1:51:31] oh
[1:51:36] foreign
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:52:09] really
[1:52:13] all things are possible
[1:52:21] only
[1:52:24] amen
[1:52:25] amen we sure are blessed if we're happy
[1:52:29] to the Lord that our our brothers were
[1:52:32] so blessed going on the trip it seems
[1:52:35] like the Lord certainly
[1:52:39] set a fire in their heart and
[1:52:42] we just are grateful for that and I
[1:52:45] thought as I looked at the pictures and
[1:52:48] you know
[1:52:51] nice cars and places and
[1:52:55] I thought how many more years ago the
[1:52:58] gospel's still going
[1:53:00] first time I went there about 1980
[1:53:03] and uh
[1:53:04] there's still people hungry for God's
[1:53:06] word
[1:53:07] amen so we just got glad the work
[1:53:11] continues and those brothers are serving
[1:53:14] the lord and we love the Lord and every
[1:53:16] day in our life
[1:53:18] you know the life of the Lord is
[1:53:20] not up and down
[1:53:22] it's just steady practical every day
[1:53:27] feed on the ground knowing that he's God
[1:53:32] and that you're his and whatsoever
[1:53:34] things you ask
[1:53:36] he will do amen so let us pray tonight
[1:53:41] as we are going to go we'll sing that a
[1:53:45] song for our dismissal God is good we
[1:53:49] certainly saw how God good God was and I
[1:53:54] I kind of
[1:53:56] in my heart I kind of chuckled uh
[1:54:00] because I I know what that's like
[1:54:01] driving from one Church five or six
[1:54:04] seven hours to another church and
[1:54:06] preaching and driving five or six hours
[1:54:08] and I know how much it wore out and I
[1:54:10] thought you know
[1:54:12] I don't know if I could do that again
[1:54:14] but I'm glad there's young guys that are
[1:54:16] willing to get up and do it huh so let's
[1:54:20] just keep them in prayer maybe the Lord
[1:54:22] will open more doors for him and and it
[1:54:25] can certainly have a good thing so let's
[1:54:28] pray together father tonight we're so
[1:54:30] happy that you said cosmons and Andrew's
[1:54:34] heart's a flame
