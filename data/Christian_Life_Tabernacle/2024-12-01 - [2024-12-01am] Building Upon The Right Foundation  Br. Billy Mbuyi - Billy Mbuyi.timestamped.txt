[29:56] all and all all to thee my
[30:03] blessed
[30:09] [Music]
[30:13] savior God bless
[30:15] you I was um listening to a tape that
[30:19] spoke about uh by faith Moses and um
[30:24] brother Brandon described how lot looked
[30:27] at s him he saw the green grass but he
[30:29] didn't see that his wife would turn into
[30:31] a pillow of salt that he would lose his
[30:34] children and barely escape with his life
[30:37] but he gave the example of Moses and
[30:39] said he could have been a pharaoh but by
[30:42] faith he looked beyond the immediate
[30:45] offerings that he was getting and he saw
[30:49] um he he saw the future promise you know
[30:52] of Deliverance of the children of Israel
[30:54] and he counted that better than what the
[30:57] devil was offering him
[30:59] so that's where I got the inspiration to
[31:01] sing this song The Midnight Cry I hope
[31:03] it's a blessing to you that one day God
[31:07] will come and take us off this Earth and
[31:09] we have to look beyond all the material
[31:11] things that the devil is offering us so

[49:47] all our visitors so God bless you this
[49:49] morning amen I trust you're happy to be
[49:51] in the house of God let's open our
[49:53] Bibles um man Thanksgiving is gone
[49:57] Christmas has started
[49:59] so I guess that's how it works right so
[50:03] um first Peter uh chapter
[50:24] one uh verse 20 uh 22 it
[50:29] says seeing that ye have purified your
[50:33] soul in obeying the truth through the
[50:37] spirit unto unfringed
[50:39] love of the Brethren see that ye love
[50:43] one another with pure heart uh fervently
[50:48] being born again not of corruptible sin
[50:52] but
[50:53] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[50:56] liveth and abideth
[50:58] forever for All Flesh is as grass and
[51:02] all glory as the men of men as the
[51:05] flower of grass then the grass withered
[51:09] and the flower whereof Fallen away but
[51:13] the word of the Lord endureth
[51:17] forever and this is the word which ye
[51:21] which by the gospel is preached unto you
[51:26] so it's by the word that abideth forever
[51:29] also if you can turn in Matthew chap
[51:32] 24 uh verse
[51:36] 35 uh a very familiar scripture
[51:41] reading the Bible the scripture will say
[51:44] Matthew 24 and
[51:48] 35 it would say that
[51:58] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[52:02] words shall not pass away gracious
[52:05] father we ask that you bless your word
[52:07] to us in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:09] Christ we pray amen and as you're seting
[52:12] also turn your Bibles in 1 Corinthians
[52:14] chapter 3 and verse
[52:17] 11 it says for other Foundation can no
[52:21] man lay than this is laid which is Jesus
[52:26] Christ
[52:27] in 1 Corinthians 14 and8 the scripture
[52:30] will say for if the trumpet is uh if the
[52:35] trumpet gives an uncertain sound who
[52:38] shall prepare himself for the battle I
[52:42] just want to uh speak for a moment this
[52:44] morning uh I want to it's my title and I
[52:48] hope it's just to help us so we can uh
[52:51] kind of know what to focus on this
[52:53] morning uh building upon the right
[52:55] foundation
[52:57] building upon the right foundation uh we
[53:01] we we can say certainly this morning um
[53:05] um I trust you're happy to be in the
[53:06] house of God this morning I know there's
[53:08] a lot a lot of people missing but uh we
[53:11] that are here will try to have church as
[53:13] much as we can amen uh we are living in
[53:17] uncertain times we can that we we
[53:20] everybody knows it whether you a
[53:22] Believer nonbeliever um you can
[53:24] certainly look at the world and see that
[53:26] uh things are not what they used to be
[53:29] uh the world is more divided than ever
[53:31] before there's more uncertainty in life
[53:34] than it ever was before uh people don't
[53:37] know uh what's going to happen tomorrow
[53:40] uh there's less Unity than it ever was
[53:43] before I was just looking at at just
[53:46] different uh uh World Systems and and
[53:51] and how the division runs so deep you
[53:55] know in in politics you you would think
[53:59] uh people have become so much uh
[54:02] ideological it used to be where people
[54:05] could find a common ground for the good
[54:07] of the country you know you you you know
[54:11] I remember not even uh 20 years ago not
[54:14] long ago that there will be something
[54:16] would happen and everybody will be
[54:17] United for the good of the country so
[54:19] they can get something done but we you
[54:22] find out that people are right now a lot
[54:25] more div than there ever was before you
[54:28] can see that that that that middle
[54:31] ground where people could come and join
[54:33] together for for the sake of doing
[54:35] something good it it doesn't exist
[54:38] anymore in fact you would find that even
[54:41] someone will come up with something a
[54:43] good idea that could be good for the
[54:45] country but just because it came from
[54:48] one party the other party will work as
[54:50] hardest they again to kill it and and
[54:53] and so there's not the division runs so
[54:55] deep and you look at in society there is
[54:59] such an increase uh in in division and
[55:03] people are divided they they try to
[55:05] divide People based on classes and and
[55:08] races and and different genders and it
[55:11] seems like genders come online every
[55:13] other day you know there's a new gender
[55:15] that's out there you know there's so
[55:17] much division the there's so much
[55:20] confusion you couldn't tell what's
[55:22] what's right and what's wrong and it's
[55:25] like every FL flever of it runs deep and
[55:28] you look at the global tensions and the
[55:30] local tensions there conflict in uh in
[55:34] global economy and and the trade and the
[55:37] climate change and and and people we the
[55:41] world used to be so if something is
[55:44] happening over one side it's hard for
[55:46] the other to be affected now anything
[55:49] affects everybody you know whatever is
[55:51] happening America is affecting everybody
[55:53] else the economy the world economy
[55:56] connected together everything is is one
[55:59] is all connected and and and people are
[56:02] divided in social media if you you you a
[56:06] Republican you go to Fox News if you're
[56:08] a Democrat you got SM SNM I'm
[56:13] sorry MSNBC and CNN you got those and
[56:17] and that's where and and and and and it
[56:20] doesn't help if you if you go and all
[56:23] you do is listen to Fox News they just
[56:26] repeat the same thing that you already
[56:27] believe and you go to the other side
[56:29] they repeat the same thing that you
[56:31] already so people just anchor down to
[56:34] what they already have not that you're
[56:36] going to make any changes but just
[56:38] that's the way it is the economy you
[56:40] know
[56:42] instability uh it it used to be that
[56:44] people had system in place where uh if
[56:48] the world economy will move and they
[56:50] would deploy those systems and say this
[56:53] is what we're going to use and they had
[56:55] formulas now those formulas don't work
[56:57] anymore why because there's a lot more
[56:59] variable than what they accounted for
[57:01] before so it doesn't really help it it
[57:05] becomes unstable and and and it becomes
[57:08] something you cannot Count On The Rise
[57:10] into uh the uh AI the artificial
[57:13] intelligence and and and and and
[57:16] technology and just the rapid
[57:19] advancement in everything and and it
[57:21] bring so much uncertainty for the
[57:23] workforce and people uh afraid lose
[57:26] their jobs they're going to be replaced
[57:28] by machines and you don't know what's
[57:29] going to happen tomorrow and and you
[57:32] know I was thinking about this you we
[57:34] live in a time where there there's so
[57:36] much information that's required at
[57:39] first you know you could get a job and
[57:41] and just do a task and and what you need
[57:43] to do will be you know just something
[57:46] small and and concise now you have to
[57:48] know everything to to be able to do your
[57:51] job and there's the introduction of that
[57:53] the amount of information you have to
[57:55] know to just do a simple task has grown
[57:57] so exponentially because we live in the
[58:00] age of Technology you look at the the
[58:03] the the the the the the climate change
[58:05] and uh growing concern of environment
[58:08] and degradation and natural disasters
[58:11] and and and and it you find out that the
[58:14] things that man is doing to the Earth
[58:16] it's not sustainable for long term that
[58:19] this we we cannot keep going in the
[58:22] direction we're going and expect things
[58:24] to get better will never get better and
[58:27] and what man is doing is polluting the
[58:29] Earth but says man is killing himself
[58:32] man is producing his own destruction the
[58:35] the generational Gap and you have uh the
[58:38] older people want one thing and the
[58:40] younger people want another you know the
[58:42] younger people you know I was I was uh
[58:46] in the car with my kids one day and I
[58:48] believe I don't know where we're going
[58:50] and and and my daughter said oh you know
[58:53] don't do that it's not good for the
[58:55] environment
[58:56] and I look I said it's not good for what
[58:59] and so yet we are you know we the school
[59:02] we send kids to school for Education now
[59:05] they go and they turn them into activist
[59:08] you know you know and and they they care
[59:10] more about the environment and it it's
[59:13] going to burn you know and and the older
[59:16] generation cares about one the younger
[59:18] cares about the other such a division
[59:21] everywhere the the Health crisis and the
[59:24] pandemics and we we don't know when the
[59:26] next one is going to come across the
[59:28] line and and what the effect of it would
[59:31] be and and mental issues everywhere why
[59:34] because we we are so much overloaded
[59:37] with information and and the human mind
[59:40] cannot process the amount of information
[59:43] we are receiving today your your phone
[59:46] is giving you so much information that
[59:49] your your nervous system is not sustain
[59:52] uh uh built to sustain that type of
[59:54] information and you have to know you
[59:56] wake up in the morning by the time you
[59:58] find out what's going on with the
[59:59] weather to find out what's going on in
[1:00:01] politics in economy and everything and
[1:00:04] who did what and what happened that
[1:00:06] alone is like a job in itself and and
[1:00:09] yet you got to go and people have to put
[1:00:11] in more hours than they used to put
[1:00:13] before so it's just a complete chaos
[1:00:16] it's not sustainable it cannot last and
[1:00:19] the global conflict and you look at the
[1:00:22] wars and and geographical tensions and s
[1:00:26] and rising and Israel fighting so many
[1:00:29] wars there's Gaza War there's a war
[1:00:32] against Lebanon there's war against
[1:00:34] Syria there's there's everybody is
[1:00:36] involved in a war Ukraine over there
[1:00:38] Russia over here United States just a
[1:00:41] global tension and you can look at it
[1:00:44] however you can think and realize that
[1:00:47] this is not
[1:00:49] sustainable and and people try to ignore
[1:00:52] it and go about their lives and act like
[1:00:55] nothing is happening the Earth is a lot
[1:00:57] more unstable today than it ever
[1:01:00] was and Bam will say in the message un
[1:01:03] certain uh the if the trumpet gives an
[1:01:06] uncertain sound it said and I think of
[1:01:08] it just a few moment moments ago it said
[1:01:12] when I was thinking on this it said the
[1:01:14] income tax Affair and I thought there's
[1:01:16] hardly anything today that is
[1:01:20] certain everything has got so much
[1:01:22] uncertainty to it anything uncertain it
[1:01:25] says and anything that's uncertain
[1:01:28] cannot be
[1:01:30] trusted anything that is uncertain
[1:01:33] cannot be trusted and you cannot build
[1:01:36] upon something that's uncertain and he
[1:01:38] says and anything that that's uncertain
[1:01:41] cannot be trusted you stay away from it
[1:01:44] and and if it's not certain and it says
[1:01:48] and if you got a business and which we
[1:01:50] got businessmen present and maybe many
[1:01:53] of them and then say if you are running
[1:01:55] a business it's not it's not certain you
[1:01:58] it says you are not going to put your uh
[1:02:01] your very much in it because the
[1:02:03] dividend is uncertain and you wouldn't
[1:02:06] make uh much investment in
[1:02:08] it or if you are a good shrewd
[1:02:12] businessman you will wait and search out
[1:02:16] and if you got some money to invest it
[1:02:18] says you've got some money until you
[1:02:20] find something that's certain something
[1:02:23] that's reliable something that's
[1:02:25] dependent
[1:02:26] so the rules of investment require
[1:02:29] certainty reliability and dependency so
[1:02:32] you couldn't go and and put money in
[1:02:35] crypto and be surprised you lost
[1:02:38] money you you couldn't go and and put
[1:02:40] money in the penny stock and and be
[1:02:43] surprised you lost money why because
[1:02:45] it's not certain it's not dependable and
[1:02:49] it's not reliable so the rules of
[1:02:51] investment brother bam is warning us and
[1:02:55] and and uh oh there's just so much
[1:02:57] spiritual but I want to just lay a
[1:02:59] foundation before we can get there and
[1:03:01] it it it's very important that when we
[1:03:04] build our own lives and he's wanting us
[1:03:06] to be as businessmen as those that are
[1:03:10] uh uh have study what we are doing and
[1:03:12] be careful about what we're trying to
[1:03:14] achieve and make sure am I building on
[1:03:16] the right foundation what what I'm about
[1:03:18] to engage in and what what I'm about to
[1:03:21] invest in is it something that's certain
[1:03:23] is it something that's reliable is it
[1:03:26] something that's dependent he says
[1:03:28] because you don't want to lose you don't
[1:03:30] want to lose the little money that
[1:03:32] you've saved up because with uh with
[1:03:35] that you have to make your living it
[1:03:38] said and out of the re re uh
[1:03:40] renumeration from the dividend you draw
[1:03:43] the Investments and and and and that to
[1:03:47] get something to live by so you have to
[1:03:49] look at for investment you you just not
[1:03:52] have to uh consider first the reliabil
[1:03:56] the dependency and the certainty but you
[1:03:58] got to look at the track record is it
[1:04:01] something that how is it perform over
[1:04:03] the last 10 years over the last 20 years
[1:04:06] is it something that if I put my money
[1:04:09] in on the long run I'm guaranteed uh uh
[1:04:12] you know even though they said that past
[1:04:14] uh uh past performance is not indicative
[1:04:16] of the future but the disclaimer but yet
[1:04:20] you understand that you got to have some
[1:04:22] track record there's got to be something
[1:04:24] you look at for you to say this is a
[1:04:26] good investment you got to have some
[1:04:29] history on it you got to have something
[1:04:31] that you can look and say that I have
[1:04:33] study this and I can put my trust on it
[1:04:36] and I wonder if that's the same thing we
[1:04:38] do with our lives you know we we put our
[1:04:41] trust in our jobs and we put our trust
[1:04:43] in the economy we put our trust in our
[1:04:46] paycheck and well I get my paycheck I'll
[1:04:48] do this but if you actually consider and
[1:04:51] around the track record and see which
[1:04:54] one will be performing for you and which
[1:04:56] is it that will sustain you and I want
[1:04:59] to say this we as Christians have been
[1:05:02] given the word of God for us to put our
[1:05:04] trust on
[1:05:06] it but what I'm say so so it says uh uh
[1:05:10] business is is is uh is business is
[1:05:14] certainty is certainly I'm sorry on the
[1:05:16] shaking stand and stand tonight any
[1:05:19] business practically in the world is in
[1:05:22] shaken condition because the world is sh
[1:05:25] in a second condition it says you can't
[1:05:28] allow yourself it says now I'm I'm I'm
[1:05:31] going to say to save so much money to
[1:05:34] build a nice home and and he says a
[1:05:37] little home somewhere he says that's
[1:05:39] pretty shaky he says I'll tell you it
[1:05:42] says I'll tell you it is because the
[1:05:44] government could take it all over it
[1:05:48] could take it all all over overnight
[1:05:50] that's right so we can't even trust the
[1:05:53] money we have in the bank we can't trust
[1:05:55] the house houses that we live in all it
[1:05:57] takes is somebody to go in and raise the
[1:05:59] taxes and they'll take it away from you
[1:06:02] all of that would do is something will
[1:06:04] happen somebody will go and freeze your
[1:06:06] assets and everything you'll be gone and
[1:06:09] so if we put our trust on how much money
[1:06:12] I have what car I drive and what job I
[1:06:14] have we are putting our trust in
[1:06:17] something that is completely
[1:06:22] uncertain but when I'm will continue and
[1:06:25] he says uh democracy is uncertain people
[1:06:28] arguing and fighting and it says no more
[1:06:32] common sense in the countries and and
[1:06:34] people fighting left and right and and
[1:06:37] the country going in the trajectory
[1:06:39] where it's going down and and I heard
[1:06:41] the say I thought it was so right that
[1:06:43] said that Washington is a place where
[1:06:45] all the good ideas go to
[1:06:47] die it's not about a good idea the
[1:06:50] moment a good idea come there's
[1:06:52] thousands of people waiting to shoot it
[1:06:54] and even if Will Survive that the the
[1:06:57] amount of bureaucracy that idea has to
[1:06:59] Cross by the time it comes to the other
[1:07:01] side it's a complete different idea than
[1:07:03] what started it so you can't help it
[1:07:07] it's it's it was prophesied that it
[1:07:09] would sink and all everything that
[1:07:12] they're doing is just leading it in that
[1:07:15] trajectory but what I'm say is that I
[1:07:17] think the whole thing is rotten the
[1:07:21] whole thing is rotten but so say home
[1:07:24] life is UNC you know I I was thinking
[1:07:27] about this it's it used to be where you
[1:07:30] know a family that uh a man a a a one
[1:07:35] person the man will be able to get a job
[1:07:38] and with that job he'll be able to to to
[1:07:40] take care of his family buy a home and
[1:07:42] buy a car and and be able to support his
[1:07:45] family now you can't do that anymore now
[1:07:48] you need all the the whole two people
[1:07:50] this to go find jobs and one living in
[1:07:53] the morning the other working at night
[1:07:55] and and basically you get a family and
[1:07:58] the kids are raised by TVs computers and
[1:08:00] laptops and that's where they get the
[1:08:02] education why it's uncertain you know
[1:08:06] the the the the this one has to work
[1:08:08] that has to work because why the cost of
[1:08:11] everything is rising and and and the
[1:08:13] family can hardly sit around the table
[1:08:15] and eat the meal together you know
[1:08:18] everybody's engag in something this one
[1:08:20] is got to do this that's got to be
[1:08:22] people are a lot more busy than they
[1:08:24] used to be
[1:08:26] and and all constantly trying to achieve
[1:08:29] things but yet not having enough time to
[1:08:31] do it the people are addicted to the
[1:08:33] devices and consuming information in a
[1:08:36] way that they never been able to do
[1:08:39] before what an uncertainty but says a
[1:08:42] home life has become uncertain you know
[1:08:45] he says I seen a PC the other day and
[1:08:48] then on the journalist says the American
[1:08:50] divorce rate is the highest in than any
[1:08:53] other nation in the world
[1:08:56] and then we're supposed to be a
[1:08:57] religious Nation it says yes could that
[1:09:00] be it says religious it says all right
[1:09:03] it's not the it's not the right kind
[1:09:05] they said religion is is just the
[1:09:09] covering it's hard to tell what we are
[1:09:12] what what we will make uh what we make
[1:09:15] our covering out of Adam trying to make
[1:09:17] it out of fig trees fig leaves and it
[1:09:20] didn't work it's got it says it got
[1:09:23] awful shaky when he had to come out to
[1:09:26] meet God so religion doesn't meet it
[1:09:31] religion doesn't meet it at all he says
[1:09:34] but you but could you think that our
[1:09:37] divorce rates is higher than all the
[1:09:40] rest of the country all the rest of the
[1:09:42] countries he says our divorce rate we
[1:09:44] find
[1:09:45] immorality on the Move in our homes so
[1:09:50] and this is very important because we we
[1:09:53] have to be conscious of where we are
[1:09:55] trying to build upon we have to be
[1:09:58] reminded that that it the the the world
[1:10:01] there's no uncertainty and it's a
[1:10:04] shaking sand it's a sinking sand if you
[1:10:07] try to build upon it you will receive
[1:10:09] the result of the sinking sand it will
[1:10:12] say that if any man that's going to
[1:10:14] marry a uh if any woman is going to
[1:10:17] marry a man she's got uh uh she's she's
[1:10:20] not certain that that man uh she's not
[1:10:23] certain of that man she's better leave
[1:10:26] him alone and any man that's going to
[1:10:28] marry a woman and not certain you better
[1:10:32] leave her alone it says you better pray
[1:10:35] through on it until God gives you the
[1:10:39] answer so a certainty in doing things
[1:10:42] and trying to get married and I can
[1:10:45] expand it and say trying to get a job
[1:10:47] trying to take care of of you is to go
[1:10:49] down and pray until God gives you the
[1:10:53] answer it's not until you figure out and
[1:10:55] you come up with a better plan and it's
[1:10:58] not until you figure out and come up
[1:11:00] with an excuse to support what you're
[1:11:01] trying to do no it's to go down on our
[1:11:04] knees and pray until God gives you an
[1:11:07] answer and then when God gives you an
[1:11:09] answer then you are standing on Solid
[1:11:16] Ground education we said is
[1:11:21] uncertain you you're thinking about kids
[1:11:25] go to school and parents spend so much
[1:11:28] money and they get loans and everything
[1:11:30] and and then they go and and then they
[1:11:33] get out of school with a degree that
[1:11:35] they cannot use with so much debt in
[1:11:39] student loan and then they come out an
[1:11:41] activist at the
[1:11:43] end you you you wonder is this is this
[1:11:46] really something that one can rely on is
[1:11:49] it something we can really uh uh put our
[1:11:52] trust on and is it something the world
[1:11:55] world is falling apart every day the
[1:11:58] world is crumbling every day but what
[1:12:01] I'm says there's Wars everywhere this
[1:12:03] nation United Nation is not longer
[1:12:05] working everything that they put in
[1:12:07] place where after the world war we said
[1:12:10] well we're going to come as a league of
[1:12:11] nation and and and and try to work
[1:12:14] together so we can find Common Ground
[1:12:16] the whole thing today you can look at it
[1:12:18] and say it's the most uncertain thing
[1:12:21] that there is they they can't even come
[1:12:23] up with one resolution that all can
[1:12:25] agree
[1:12:28] on the church life is
[1:12:31] uncertain you know people just uh want
[1:12:34] to be everybody wants to be a Maverick
[1:12:37] and you know I'll go to church whenever
[1:12:39] I feel like and you know I don't want
[1:12:41] any responsibilities and people you know
[1:12:44] choose churches like a candy flavor you
[1:12:47] know today I want peach and then they
[1:12:50] decide what church they're going to go
[1:12:51] to tomorrow I want Strawberry and they
[1:12:53] go to another church they they don't
[1:12:55] want to be tied down to anything people
[1:12:57] want to be free you know if they feel
[1:13:00] like they've had so much Church you know
[1:13:02] they want to detox a little bit from
[1:13:04] church you know I you know I no much not
[1:13:07] too much connection and let me say this
[1:13:09] that kind of attitude will always
[1:13:11] produce
[1:13:12] uncertainty God is looking for prisoners
[1:13:16] God is looking for people that are tied
[1:13:18] down people that understand the fight
[1:13:21] that it takes and people that will stand
[1:13:24] there until a happens people that are
[1:13:26] there for the Long Haul people that are
[1:13:29] looking for the kingdom of God every day
[1:13:32] people that are waiting and expecting
[1:13:34] for the promise to come to pass into
[1:13:36] their lives that is
[1:13:39] certain and let me just say this so they
[1:13:42] will come and and and they they don't
[1:13:44] want any long-term commitment you know
[1:13:47] they want a a a a a a a week by week
[1:13:51] pass you know I'll come today I'll see
[1:13:53] how it goes and then I'll decide how we
[1:13:56] going to do the next week and I'll come
[1:13:58] you know we have I only need to come to
[1:14:00] one service that's good enough for me
[1:14:02] I've gotten enough I gotten everything
[1:14:04] that I need in one service butam says
[1:14:07] one thing it says that the Holy Spirit
[1:14:09] feeds on the word if one has the Holy
[1:14:12] Spirit within their heart they cannot
[1:14:14] stay away from church they cannot stay
[1:14:17] away from the word of God there
[1:14:19] something within their hearts that's
[1:14:20] bubbling they know that they're not
[1:14:22] doing it just fors but they're doing it
[1:14:25] for the good of
[1:14:26] everybody they want to be a team player
[1:14:28] they want to be part of the team why
[1:14:30] because they understand that their lives
[1:14:33] they' been commissioned and placed on
[1:14:34] Earth to play a role in God's
[1:14:40] kingdom church is uncertainty but when
[1:14:42] I'm say it says Church Life is shook
[1:14:45] happen people don't hardly uh uh uh
[1:14:49] people they says people don't know
[1:14:52] hardly what to do it says uh they go
[1:14:56] wandering from church to church and
[1:14:58] trying to find out which one is right
[1:15:00] and from Pillar To Post and trying to
[1:15:02] find out which is right and which is the
[1:15:05] right Doctrine and and and and and and
[1:15:07] one will come around and and they can
[1:15:09] explain it and just almost the very
[1:15:12] Point uh of the Creeds is right and then
[1:15:15] the first thing you know is they find so
[1:15:17] much corruption in that until they try
[1:15:20] they try in other
[1:15:23] Church see
[1:15:26] uh you say and then they try and at the
[1:15:27] church uh they try uh
[1:15:31] uh uh they try and add the church it
[1:15:33] says to see that the to see what the
[1:15:36] Creeds is and the doctrine it says it
[1:15:39] says all this we find out that we have
[1:15:42] broken ourselves up then it says by
[1:15:46] these things and 100 and uh to hundred
[1:15:49] of different orders of church he says
[1:15:52] now there's nothing against that there's
[1:15:54] just that they can't that they can do
[1:15:57] the other things then it says they do
[1:16:00] they do do it says and there go and then
[1:16:05] there there got to be some good come out
[1:16:07] of it somewhere but you see you can't
[1:16:11] put your confidence in saying I belong
[1:16:14] to the Methodist Association of churches
[1:16:17] I'm he says I'm all right because I
[1:16:19] belong to I belong to the Baptist I'm I
[1:16:23] I'm all right you can't do that and I
[1:16:25] want to add this you can't say I belong
[1:16:27] to Christian Life Tabernacle or I
[1:16:30] believe the message of the hour then I'm
[1:16:31] fine that's not okay that's not what God
[1:16:35] requires God doesn't require sometime of
[1:16:38] uh of uh uh uh uh uh uh like a like you
[1:16:41] wear like a bee that you can show
[1:16:43] everybody what church you go to and what
[1:16:45] to do what God is requiring is the new
[1:16:48] birth in his body and that that and that
[1:16:52] wouldn't matter what church you go
[1:16:54] through because you have made him
[1:16:55] himself what God requires is a personal
[1:16:58] con connection with him where you are
[1:17:00] built upon a firm foundation you are not
[1:17:03] built upon the intellect or the
[1:17:06] understanding of men but you are built
[1:17:07] on Christ
[1:17:09] Alone Oh My and but and so you would say
[1:17:14] you've talked about so much uncertainty
[1:17:16] is there anything at all that's
[1:17:17] uncertain but what as and then he says
[1:17:20] I'm glad to say that the only sure
[1:17:22] things that's that's that's certain that
[1:17:25] you can build upon is the word of God
[1:17:28] and this is the Firm Foundation this is
[1:17:32] the foundation that will not move and
[1:17:34] let me announce to you this morning the
[1:17:36] word of God is the foundation that put
[1:17:39] the world into existence the word of God
[1:17:42] is what calls everything into existence
[1:17:45] unless you are built upon the word of
[1:17:47] God you are on Shaky Ground but if you
[1:17:50] are built upon the word of God but what
[1:17:53] I'm says as God is eternal so are you
[1:17:55] Eternal when you are built upon the word
[1:17:58] of God you are building upon the Eternal
[1:18:01] material that cannot pass away the
[1:18:03] scripture will tell us Heaven and Earth
[1:18:05] can pass away but my words cannot pass
[1:18:08] away so when you build upon the word of
[1:18:11] God you are building upon something
[1:18:13] Eternal something that is stable
[1:18:16] something that will stand the test of
[1:18:18] time something that can come against our
[1:18:21] position and resist and something that
[1:18:23] can actually produ the right
[1:18:29] results the scripture will say in
[1:18:31] Matthew 24 and 35 and said Heaven and
[1:18:36] Earth will pass
[1:18:39] away but my word will not fail amen God
[1:18:45] has a certain
[1:18:48] Foundation a found a foundation that
[1:18:51] cannot
[1:18:52] move and it's amazing
[1:18:56] how we build on things that can fail
[1:18:59] it's amazing how we put our trust in as
[1:19:04] if we had any ability
[1:19:06] whatsoever we we put our trust and we
[1:19:09] build and and we build and we we act as
[1:19:13] if tomorrow belongs to us not
[1:19:15] understanding that this breath could be
[1:19:17] taken away at any
[1:19:19] moment you it's not up up to you to
[1:19:22] decide when how long how long you're
[1:19:24] going to live and all those things it's
[1:19:26] given upon God himself for him to decide
[1:19:30] that and yet we take this life and we
[1:19:32] run it around everywhere we want we do
[1:19:34] whatever we want forgetting that it's
[1:19:36] somebody who gave it to us and we're
[1:19:39] going to answer for every ounce of
[1:19:41] breath that we
[1:19:44] took the scripture will say in the
[1:19:47] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:19:50] with God and the Word was God is it's
[1:19:53] the it's upon on this original
[1:19:57] Foundation that the Bible is telling us
[1:19:59] to build it's Upon This original
[1:20:02] Foundation that he says where were you
[1:20:05] when I laid the foundation of the world
[1:20:07] it was the word of God that spoke the
[1:20:09] foundation of the world into existence
[1:20:12] where were you he began to ask Joe in
[1:20:14] other words there was a time where all
[1:20:16] of this was being said there was a time
[1:20:18] where God was setting up his children
[1:20:21] there was a time where he was calling
[1:20:22] all his people together there was a time
[1:20:25] where the sons of God Rejoice for
[1:20:27] rejoiced in the time where they came
[1:20:29] into understanding of what God plan was
[1:20:32] and what was going to transpire in the
[1:20:34] future they looked at it and they
[1:20:36] rejoiced and it's only when you come
[1:20:38] upon that same Foundation Hallelujah not
[1:20:41] another Foundation that same Foundation
[1:20:45] that's the only foundation that will
[1:20:46] last that's the only foundation that we
[1:20:49] are supposed to be built upon that's the
[1:20:51] only foundation that God himself has
[1:20:53] laid down amen amen all at the ground is
[1:20:56] sinking sand you build upon the economy
[1:20:59] you'll get the economy result you build
[1:21:02] upon your understanding you'll get your
[1:21:04] understanding you build upon your job
[1:21:06] you'll get your job result you build
[1:21:08] upon anything else you'll get your that
[1:21:10] job that whatever you build upon result
[1:21:12] but you build upon the word of God you
[1:21:14] get Eternal
[1:21:17] results let's not kid ourself let's come
[1:21:20] into the understanding that I'm supposed
[1:21:22] to be built upon the word of God
[1:21:25] don't don't be drawn aside left and
[1:21:27] right by your jobs by things built upon
[1:21:29] the word of God let me say this you can
[1:21:32] put confidence in your job but just
[1:21:34] don't forget who gave you that job it's
[1:21:36] not your boss who gave you that job your
[1:21:40] boss like you today they can dislike you
[1:21:42] tomorrow and you gone but the God who
[1:21:44] gave you that job will give you another
[1:21:48] job the scripture says I never seen a
[1:21:51] righteous man beg bread why because they
[1:21:54] are built upon a solid foundation if God
[1:21:57] can feed the birds if God can give a
[1:22:01] lion his food if God can dress the
[1:22:04] flower can do that he says how much more
[1:22:07] ye that are his
[1:22:08] children what Foundation are we built
[1:22:14] upon amen remember all the other
[1:22:18] foundations are sinking
[1:22:21] sand consider the lily of the field amen
[1:22:25] who is he talking to he's talking about
[1:22:27] you he's wanting you to understand that
[1:22:30] those Lily of the field they built upon
[1:22:32] the rat Foundation they have an
[1:22:35] understanding that I have been built by
[1:22:37] God the flower the aroma that I give you
[1:22:40] coming from God the birds they don't
[1:22:42] worry about what they're going to eat
[1:22:44] next why because they know that God will
[1:22:46] give them the grain they know that The
[1:22:48] Light Young Lion cries out and God has
[1:22:51] to provide food for them
[1:22:54] how much more
[1:22:56] us this
[1:22:57] morning we we we try to provide for
[1:23:00] oursel but says quit doing that God
[1:23:04] wants you to rely on him he's the F
[1:23:09] Foundation it says Heaven and Earth will
[1:23:11] pass away but my words will not pass
[1:23:14] away what I have built will not pass
[1:23:17] away what I have spoken will come to
[1:23:19] pass what I have said will come to pass
[1:23:22] once all is said and done will come to
[1:23:28] pass
[1:23:30] hallelu upon the
[1:23:33] original
[1:23:35] Foundation that God is going to build
[1:23:39] this church upon on the
[1:23:42] original revelation of the word of God
[1:23:45] he asked Peter he says what do men say
[1:23:48] that I am but when I'm will take it and
[1:23:50] speak it this way it says but Luke said
[1:23:52] in Luke it says believe I will coming
[1:23:54] down to the mountain and his dis spouse
[1:23:57] and and he said to his disciples he says
[1:23:59] uh who do who the men say that the son
[1:24:01] of man am he says one said you are
[1:24:04] Jeremiah the other the prophet and so
[1:24:06] forth but but he said but what do you
[1:24:09] say that I am in other word who am I to
[1:24:11] you he said when Peter he says when
[1:24:14] Peter made that notable statement he
[1:24:16] says Thou Are Christ the son of the
[1:24:18] Living God he said blessed are thou
[1:24:21] Simon the son of Jonah for flesh and
[1:24:24] blood has not revealed to you but my
[1:24:26] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[1:24:28] this to you Upon This Rock will I build
[1:24:31] my church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:24:34] Prevail against it in other word upon
[1:24:37] this Foundation what was the foundation
[1:24:40] the foundation was the constant
[1:24:42] revealing of God to his people the
[1:24:46] foundation was not uh an intellectual
[1:24:49] understanding the foundation was the
[1:24:51] word of God that was hid from the
[1:24:53] beginning the the word of God that no
[1:24:55] man understood the word of God that was
[1:24:57] promised to come that God will take his
[1:25:00] word and he will make it a come to pass
[1:25:03] into your life that not somebody else
[1:25:05] not another person's testimony but God
[1:25:08] will give you a testimony so you can
[1:25:11] know he's a living God that God is
[1:25:13] wanting for you to know him personally
[1:25:16] he's wanting you to walk with him to
[1:25:19] know that he's your provider to know
[1:25:21] that he's the one who's going to provide
[1:25:23] for all that you have need of up on that
[1:25:25] Foundation that's what the Church of God
[1:25:27] is built upon it wasn't a bunch of
[1:25:30] people that went in other word when the
[1:25:32] scripture says when God called them
[1:25:34] there was a bunch of fishermen some
[1:25:35] didn't know how to
[1:25:39] read you think he did that by
[1:25:42] accident he did it so we can come this
[1:25:45] morning and understand that the
[1:25:47] foundation of God is Not By education
[1:25:50] it's not by one who can read the fastest
[1:25:52] and the best and who has enough wisdom
[1:25:54] to understand the foundation of of God
[1:25:57] is upon the Revelation that is
[1:26:00] given that you will
[1:26:02] know I didn't get here by myself God got
[1:26:07] me here I didn't change my life by
[1:26:10] myself I didn't make myself a message
[1:26:12] believer I didn't make myself clean I
[1:26:15] didn't make myself believe that I am
[1:26:18] what I am by the grace of God that's the
[1:26:22] foundation that what God wants to build
[1:26:24] not come here and compare scriptures
[1:26:27] with scriptures no God wants you to be
[1:26:29] built upon him and him
[1:26:42] alone but
[1:26:46] say what is it
[1:26:48] then
[1:26:50] upon the revealed truth of God God's
[1:26:55] word for in the beginning was the word
[1:26:58] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:27:02] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:27:05] dwelt Among Us it was revealed to
[1:27:09] Peter that what that was God's
[1:27:13] Vindicated word
[1:27:15] amen it says that's the reason he could
[1:27:19] say who can condemn me of
[1:27:22] sin who can accuse me me everything the
[1:27:26] word has written of
[1:27:29] me I've performed it can you say that
[1:27:33] this
[1:27:34] morning everything that the word it
[1:27:37] wasn't living his own life he was living
[1:27:40] what was written of him and we spoke
[1:27:43] last time we say that the bride Jesus
[1:27:46] didn't come by his own self he came by
[1:27:48] the word of the Prophet what was written
[1:27:50] of him he came but says the prophet
[1:27:54] wrote it there was one Prophet who wrote
[1:27:56] it and there was one Prophet who came to
[1:27:58] identify it so one Prophet wrote The
[1:28:01] Virgin shall conceive and then another
[1:28:03] Prophet on the River Jordan it says
[1:28:05] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:28:07] the sin of the world he identified the
[1:28:09] word when the word came to manifestation
[1:28:12] and the prophet came back in the same
[1:28:14] time it says the bride is no different
[1:28:16] from the bridegroom what the bride is
[1:28:18] the bride said the they're not different
[1:28:21] because they are the word in fact it
[1:28:24] saying that the works that Jesus did so
[1:28:26] shall you
[1:28:28] do that's our identification in the end
[1:28:31] time amen it's not us trying to be
[1:28:34] something that we are not the foundation
[1:28:37] has already been laid I'm just calling
[1:28:39] us this morning and say let's walk upon
[1:28:42] that Foundation
[1:28:45] amen it says God had Vindicated it that
[1:28:50] was he says that he was the word that's
[1:28:54] it it says God manifested the word says
[1:28:59] so it says and then God makes it real
[1:29:03] bring it to pass show it so the plan of
[1:29:06] God is not oh I I I I I understood it
[1:29:10] though I I went and I figured it out one
[1:29:13] way and then I wait until I figure it
[1:29:15] out another way no it's I believe it and
[1:29:19] God is making it come to pass I believe
[1:29:23] it and the God is making it come to pass
[1:29:26] what makes this message a reality even
[1:29:29] though you would have people criticize
[1:29:31] it left and right is because when we
[1:29:33] look out there we see what was promised
[1:29:36] come to pass we can read it with our own
[1:29:39] eyes the word is bringing that to come
[1:29:41] to pass and not only that but we can
[1:29:43] look at our lives also and be able to
[1:29:46] look ourselves and identify ourselves in
[1:29:48] the message and say that's me I'm
[1:29:51] looking into the mirror of the word I
[1:29:53] can read it that I can see that's the
[1:29:55] description of my
[1:29:58] life it it's not scripture comparison
[1:30:02] it's a life lived it's the manifestation
[1:30:05] of a life that's been made
[1:30:08] manifest and let me say this God's plan
[1:30:13] for his church is by the Holy Ghost but
[1:30:18] says God's plan for his church is by the
[1:30:21] Holy Ghost God didn't want us to just
[1:30:23] gather here as a group of people and try
[1:30:26] to look at the scripture and understand
[1:30:29] it no God wants to lead us by the Holy
[1:30:32] Spirit he says this paragraph 93 if you
[1:30:35] can find it it said find it here it says
[1:30:38] the holy spirit is living his life in
[1:30:42] human
[1:30:43] beings he oh my brother my sister let me
[1:30:47] say this don't think your life is your
[1:30:49] own God has given you that life so the
[1:30:52] Holy Ghost can come
[1:30:54] into that life that he can live the life
[1:30:58] of the Holy Ghost into human beings he
[1:31:01] says manifesting himself to the world it
[1:31:05] says he makes men thirsty for him
[1:31:09] unshakable undestructible the word of
[1:31:12] God manifested showing himself the word
[1:31:16] itself being Liv out through human life
[1:31:24] if we fell short of that let me say this
[1:31:27] morning that's what the world the word
[1:31:29] of God has come to do the word of God
[1:31:31] has come so we can take this life that
[1:31:33] we have the life that's been given to us
[1:31:36] and let the Holy Ghost rule upon us so
[1:31:40] God life can become our lives so we can
[1:31:43] go out there into the world and live the
[1:31:46] life of Jesus Christ himself and be to
[1:31:49] one another the life of Jesus Christ
[1:31:51] manifested that we can influence those
[1:31:54] that are out there so when they look at
[1:31:56] our lives they can see Jesus Christ
[1:31:58] manifested my brother my sister if the
[1:32:01] first church when they looked at them
[1:32:03] they called them Christian the last
[1:32:05] church has to have the same
[1:32:07] identification it's not a different
[1:32:10] identification it's Christ the same in
[1:32:12] all ages it's always Christ so we would
[1:32:16] bece Jesus you don't see him with the
[1:32:19] body of Jesus you see him in the
[1:32:21] manifestation of that hour and the
[1:32:24] manifestation of that hour is your
[1:32:27] body The Life of Christ in me let me say
[1:32:31] this let's not fail short of that if we
[1:32:34] would miss the goods and and the riches
[1:32:37] of this world that's okay if we will
[1:32:39] miss the reputation of this world that's
[1:32:41] okay you can miss all of that but don't
[1:32:43] miss the Life of
[1:32:45] Christ let's not miss his life let's
[1:32:49] let's be hunger and thirsting and for
[1:32:51] the Life of Christ to be manifested
[1:32:53] through us because that's the main
[1:32:58] thing and let me say this it's not even
[1:33:01] to know all the
[1:33:03] Mysteries it's not even to be able to
[1:33:06] explain all that he said but it's to
[1:33:08] only have his life living through this
[1:33:12] life that I walk like Christ I talk like
[1:33:15] Christ I we treat one another like
[1:33:17] Christ we see people that are in need we
[1:33:20] act like Christ and everywhere we are we
[1:33:22] are Christlike why he's made us
[1:33:25] ambassadors and you couldn't be an
[1:33:27] ambassador unless you were given the
[1:33:29] authority to bring forth the
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:41] power he
[1:33:44] says paragraph 94 it
[1:33:48] says all through the
[1:33:51] criticism the devil is always there
[1:33:55] all through the differences all through
[1:33:58] the creds and uh Creeds and says and Alo
[1:34:01] will try to stomp out the that word of
[1:34:04] God how they will try to substitute
[1:34:07] education they try to substitute and
[1:34:10] make denomination they have confused
[1:34:12] themselves out of it all of of all of it
[1:34:16] the word of God still stand just as
[1:34:19] bright and shiny as she ever did
[1:34:24] I love
[1:34:25] that you're not going to get
[1:34:28] confused you are not called to confusion
[1:34:31] now not to say that the devil will not
[1:34:33] try he will
[1:34:35] try in fact they say that they'll be so
[1:34:38] closed that if we were possible they
[1:34:40] will deceive the elect but the scripture
[1:34:43] says praise God the elect cannot be
[1:34:46] deceived why she's been given an
[1:34:48] eyesight she's been given the eagle
[1:34:51] outside so she can look and see that
[1:34:55] deception said one place he said it's
[1:34:57] like a you take a bird you take a a a
[1:35:02] dove she's not made for her to go and
[1:35:05] eat poor uh uh stuff that are dead it's
[1:35:08] not in her she cannot eat anything
[1:35:11] that's dead it's not made that's how the
[1:35:14] bride is if you try to stomach something
[1:35:17] that's not good it's going to hurt your
[1:35:18] stomach

[1:35:27] every time you are made to Feast upon
[1:35:31] the true reveal word of God of the hour
[1:35:34] anything outside of that will only give
[1:35:36] your stomach
[1:35:40] pain oh God said both Heaven and Earth
[1:35:43] will pass away but my word shall not
[1:35:45] pass away then that's it says then

[1:37:40] itself together away from its Creed upon
[1:37:43] the word of God the church will have
[1:37:47] good

[1:38:54] don't get it and you know we get all
[1:38:56] desperates and we get all broken up and
[1:38:58] everything and God knows why he didn't
[1:39:01] give you what you were asking for why
[1:39:03] because he's trying to build character
[1:39:05] and he knows perhaps if he gives you
[1:39:06] it's going to destroy you one thing that
[1:39:08] a Christian has to have at all time is
[1:39:10] to know that God knows best about my
[1:39:13] life if I never get that what I ask for
[1:39:16] God knows best if I wanted something God
[1:39:19] didn't give me he knows what's best for
[1:39:21] me I would rather take what's best for
[1:39:23] me and take something that will lead me

[1:42:55] matter how big they are
[1:42:58] built they are building a pillar it says
[1:43:02] it's got to fall down all things that's
[1:43:06] all things that's not off against the
[1:43:09] word or against that word or contrary to
[1:43:11] it will have to move it'll have to give
[1:43:15] place because the word is coming
[1:43:19] triumphant amen triumphantly
[1:43:25] think about it I was thinking about the
[1:43:27] scripture in Daniel and the scripture
[1:43:30] speaks about the king having a dream and
[1:43:32] I love that story because he the king he
[1:43:35] has a dream and he comes and he says
[1:43:37] well I have a dream but there's only one
[1:43:39] problem here my only problem is I had a
[1:43:43] dream I don't remember what the dream
[1:43:45] was and I need somebody to give me
[1:43:50] interpretation oh my my my
[1:43:54] and all the wise men gathered together
[1:43:57] like this is
[1:43:59] unfair you couldn't tell us the dream
[1:44:02] let alone how we going to give you the
[1:44:04] he said under this Kingdom that thing
[1:44:07] that has never happened never how can
[1:44:11] you ask for the dream and ask for the
[1:44:16] interpretation Hallelujah if we give you
[1:44:18] the interpretation you're going to ask
[1:44:20] for the dream and what is the
[1:44:23] interpretation without the
[1:44:24] dream but oh my Hallelujah they said but
[1:44:28] there was a god there was one who had a
[1:44:31] God who could answer the impossible
[1:44:33] questions there was one that had a God
[1:44:36] he said that let's go to prayer he
[1:44:39] called his brother and he said let's go
[1:44:41] I believe that we have access to a God
[1:44:44] who cannot only give it give the dream
[1:44:46] but give the interpretation of it oh my
[1:44:49] brother my sister that's the foundation
[1:44:52] we want to build upon H he came and
[1:44:55] Daniel went and he prayed and he prayed
[1:44:57] God came down and he gave him the dream
[1:45:00] and the interpretation something that's
[1:45:03] never happened
[1:45:06] before you want the impossible ask God
[1:45:10] he's the one who can bring the
[1:45:12] interpretation to come to pass he will
[1:45:14] not only bring the dream but he will
[1:45:16] also bring the
[1:45:18] interpretation so they came and Daniel
[1:45:21] comes and now you know said oh King and
[1:45:24] he began to give the dream a Sor statue
[1:45:26] and it was this and it was built and
[1:45:28] half of it was Clay and glass and brass
[1:45:30] and I saw this the chest was on this and
[1:45:32] everything and then it says in the end
[1:45:35] it said it said but then I saw a stone
[1:45:38] hallelujah
[1:45:39] hallelujah not built by any man's hand I
[1:45:43] saw a stone rolling down a Rock rolling
[1:45:46] down and he came and he took all the
[1:45:48] kingdoms of the earth and he roll it all
[1:45:51] the way to the ground what is that
[1:45:53] that's the kingdom that you come from my
[1:45:56] brother my sister we have been given a
[1:45:58] rock in this same time the word of God
[1:46:01] the kingdom that will never pass away
[1:46:04] God wants you to build your life upon
[1:46:06] that Kingdom because this Kingdom will
[1:46:08] pass
[1:46:11] away a kingdom from above that you can
[1:46:16] stand upon it ride down on Earth here
[1:46:20] and go back to heaven with it
[1:46:23] any other Foundation is sinking sand no
[1:46:27] matter how beautiful it looks it's only
[1:46:30] sinking
[1:46:34] sand but
[1:46:41] say in the message the
[1:46:44] unchangeable god with the unchangeable
[1:46:47] way
[1:46:53] it says now paragraph
[1:46:55] 53 it says now the word of God the
[1:46:59] written it says written in the Bible the
[1:47:02] word of God written in the
[1:47:05] Bible is his word to us every promise
[1:47:10] has the same power of creation
[1:47:13] Hallelujah behind it amen every
[1:47:20] promise every promise
[1:47:23] not one bigger than the other my brother
[1:47:25] my sister your success and I is to take
[1:47:28] the word of God to understand that he
[1:47:31] has the same power that's why the
[1:47:33] prophet will say the word of God will
[1:47:35] defeat the Devil any place any time
[1:47:37] under any circumstance he wasn't making
[1:47:40] it out the word of God the promised word
[1:47:42] of God when it's author when it comes
[1:47:45] out of his mouth and he spoken it will
[1:47:48] not return void until it fulfills that
[1:47:51] which he has spoken it for so the word
[1:47:53] of God it says every promise has the
[1:47:56] same power of creation behind it that's
[1:48:00] God that God word did at the beginning
[1:48:02] if we believe it and if we believe it to
[1:48:05] be the word of God depends on where the
[1:48:08] seed fall I say God let it fall upon the
[1:48:11] good seed of my heart I'm preparing my
[1:48:13] heart so the word can fall and produce
[1:48:15] that which you have spoken about and it
[1:48:17] fall into the ground it says the ground
[1:48:20] can be created can be created among
[1:48:22] moisture and nourishing around the
[1:48:24] promise of God will bring forth every
[1:48:27] promise every it says bring forth every
[1:48:30] promise the Bible made it says why it
[1:48:33] says the right man of attitude toward
[1:48:36] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[1:48:38] to come to
[1:48:42] pass in the Harvest time he says the
[1:48:45] word paragraph
[1:48:47] 355 the word
[1:48:49] itself made flesh in you
[1:48:54] the word itself not not your effort not
[1:48:58] any the word itself made flesh in
[1:49:03] you you are a
[1:49:05] reflection of this
[1:49:08] hour thank you Lord what are we running
[1:49:12] from you are the reflection of what the
[1:49:16] word is for this hour but when I'm going
[1:49:19] to talk about the Sun and the Moon the
[1:49:21] light that we see out of the Moon the
[1:49:23] Moon didn't create that the moon didn't
[1:49:26] create that all that God has made in
[1:49:29] fact the moon didn't position itself so
[1:49:32] it can do that job no God positioned the
[1:49:35] moon so that when the Sun goes down when
[1:49:38] the Sun goes down on our section that
[1:49:41] the sun will reflect through the Moon
[1:49:43] and the Earth will receive the same
[1:49:46] light but through the
[1:49:48] moon the same light of the Sun God is a
[1:49:52] allowing the moon to reflect that same
[1:49:54] light the same light of the son of man
[1:49:57] the same son of man you want to say the
[1:49:59] life of Jesus was I said yes the same
[1:50:02] life the same life that raised him from
[1:50:05] the dead the same life that said I call
[1:50:08] Lazarus come forth the same life that
[1:50:10] stood there and he opened the blind eyes
[1:50:13] the same life that raised the the dead
[1:50:16] that same life is in The Believer this
[1:50:19] morning don't diminish it don't don't
[1:50:23] let the cares of this life cover it
[1:50:25] don't think your situation is too
[1:50:27] grander understand that that same life
[1:50:30] is here to do the same
[1:50:32] thing for a reflection aren't you glad
[1:50:35] to be the moon this morning I don't have
[1:50:38] a light of my own all I'm doing is
[1:50:40] reflecting his light all I'm doing is
[1:50:43] absorbing his light and reflecting it to
[1:50:45] others I'm not creating anything I'm
[1:50:49] just there to be a
[1:50:50] reflector oh God I'm so thankful for
[1:50:53] your life I'm so thankful that you've
[1:50:56] called me to reflect to if it wasn't
[1:50:58] your life I would have been lost if it
[1:51:01] wasn't your love I wouldn't have any
[1:51:02] love the love that I have for the
[1:51:04] brother is only the love that comes from
[1:51:07] you that's the
[1:51:10] foundation that we need to be built
[1:51:16] upon whatam
[1:51:18] said the foundation we are called upon
[1:51:24] I'll just try to shorten it I know I'm
[1:51:25] Hing out of time it was
[1:51:29] speaking and it was
[1:51:31] say why is it so hard for people to live
[1:51:35] a Christian life then why is it that we
[1:51:38] find it so hard why are we caught it in
[1:51:41] the ups and the down and today we feel
[1:51:44] we are saved tomorrow we feel like we're
[1:51:46] not saved and today we have the victory
[1:51:49] tomorrow we feel like we are defeated
[1:51:51] and today we feel like we are sons of
[1:51:54] God tomorrow we feel butam says the
[1:51:56] reason is because we try to do it by
[1:51:59] intellectual understanding the reason is
[1:52:01] we try to do it the way we think what we
[1:52:04] need is the New Birth by the word of God
[1:52:08] what we need is to be born by the word
[1:52:10] of God the prophet is saying it's not
[1:52:12] the fixing of this whole carcasses and
[1:52:15] let me say this the Holy Spirit was not
[1:52:17] given so we can carry it on this flesh
[1:52:20] the Holy Spirit was given so that the
[1:52:22] inner man can have it so the inner man
[1:52:25] will look at this flesh and put it under
[1:52:27] subjection will there be a time where
[1:52:29] this man feel like he's got running away
[1:52:31] yes but it's the life inside that bring
[1:52:34] him under subjection it's the life
[1:52:36] inside that will look at him and say you
[1:52:38] are liar I'll bring you under
[1:52:40] subjection it's not given for us to walk
[1:52:44] the whole Earth every day feeling like
[1:52:46] we are in the sky no it's given for you
[1:52:50] to overcome the challenge of every day
[1:52:53] amen when you when the Devil comes and
[1:52:56] he gives you a punch you give him a
[1:52:58] punch back you tell him you call me a
[1:53:01] loser you call me all of that that's
[1:53:03] this flesh but in here there's the seat
[1:53:06] of God inside
[1:53:09] it you call me I don't have this I don't
[1:53:12] have that that's okay but I know that up
[1:53:15] there I have
[1:53:18] everything it's not given for us to just
[1:53:20] say oh I can't not good enough and I'm
[1:53:24] not beautiful enough I'm not this no
[1:53:26] that's the thing of the world I'm not
[1:53:28] that but one thing I'm not is I'm not a
[1:53:31] sinner I'm a Son of
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:35] God I don't have money yes that's okay
[1:53:38] but my father owns the cattle on the
[1:53:44] thousand it's not the fixing of the old
[1:53:47] but what says this man has got to die
[1:53:51] let me say this
[1:53:53] the quicker we die the quicker we'll
[1:53:55] have
[1:53:57] life the quicker we die from this flesh
[1:54:00] the quicker you know let me say this
[1:54:02] let's quit giving excuses for our sins
[1:54:05] and let's start dying to
[1:54:08] it you have something that's not okay
[1:54:11] you have a nature something that's not
[1:54:13] okay ask God to kill it ask him by his
[1:54:16] word and say father this is not okay and
[1:54:19] this keeps upsetting me I keep going
[1:54:21] through this and listen I believe you
[1:54:23] say that the holy spirit is your life
[1:54:26] coming into my life your holy spirit is
[1:54:29] the promise of a new creation you said
[1:54:31] that you will take this flesh you will
[1:54:33] suffocate it you'll bring it to die and
[1:54:36] you'll bring a new person I want to see
[1:54:38] that new person into
[1:54:41] existence it's the dying of every day
[1:54:44] let me say this you never stop
[1:54:50] dying and he said if you kill it don't
[1:54:53] go
[1:54:53] resurrected
[1:54:56] amen many time we get delivered of
[1:54:58] things and guess what oh the old phone
[1:55:01] gets in your hand and before too long we
[1:55:04] start it starts out in a very just
[1:55:08] innocent way well I like this and then
[1:55:11] an advertisement come back and like oh
[1:55:14] okay you know I don't want to watch that
[1:55:15] and then little by little is taking you
[1:55:18] right back and resurrecting the old man
[1:55:21] what about says you got to know the
[1:55:23] devil and every single one of his tricks
[1:55:26] you got to see when he comes with his
[1:55:28] trick and say I'm not going into that
[1:55:30] direction I've been saved I've been
[1:55:33] Sanctified the desire I don't have a
[1:55:35] desire in my heart to serve the devil my
[1:55:38] desire is to serve God and I want to
[1:55:41] live for
[1:55:43] him oh
[1:55:45] my
[1:55:47] say it's
[1:55:49] not I need to stop drinking
[1:55:54] oh I look at my life and said but Ben I
[1:55:57] want to stop drinking and smoking and
[1:55:59] doing all this things and then I'll be a
[1:56:01] good Christian he said it's not what you
[1:56:04] stop doing it's what you start
[1:56:09] doing everybody's caught into what they
[1:56:11] need to stop oh I got to stop this every
[1:56:14] time you say you know if you have
[1:56:16] anything you need help with every the
[1:56:19] only list that comes to bring up is all
[1:56:22] the we want to stop doing how about
[1:56:24] instead you bring a list of all that you
[1:56:27] want to you want to do instead of one
[1:56:29] you want to
[1:56:31] stop but says if you don't have the
[1:56:35] spirit of God it's just flesh flighting
[1:56:37] with
[1:56:38] flesh and he will never win what you
[1:56:41] need is an introduction of a man in the
[1:56:44] room one who will take care of
[1:56:46] everything one who's actually able to go
[1:56:48] to battle for
[1:56:50] you one when you go back into those
[1:56:53] things will keep you
[1:56:57] miserable you fill with a spirit and you
[1:57:00] go do something wrong you'll be the most
[1:57:03] miserable person there is oh I can't
[1:57:06] believe I did that I cannot believe I
[1:57:08] cannot why you're not enjoying it why
[1:57:11] because there's a new spirit in
[1:57:14] you it's given to keep you away from
[1:57:17] those
[1:57:17] things it's not oh let me let me let me
[1:57:21] say there every every day the devil is
[1:57:23] coming up with new tactics on how to
[1:57:25] trip you every day the devil is coming
[1:57:28] up with new brand new
[1:57:30] sins that you can partake
[1:57:34] of I can't come up here with a list of
[1:57:39] everything it's what we need to start
[1:57:42] doing it's not the word I don't want any
[1:57:45] part to do with it it's not the word of
[1:57:47] God I don't want anything to do with it
[1:57:49] but when I'm will say in the message you
[1:57:51] must be born again it says paragraph 67
[1:57:55] this is preached in uh December 31st
[1:57:59] 1961 I'm going to try to get to a close
[1:58:01] quickly it
[1:58:03] says yes it
[1:58:07] says yes to be born again you must go
[1:58:11] through the process of death everything
[1:58:14] does he says you take the grain the the
[1:58:18] the grain of corn if the corn ever
[1:58:21] expect to live live again it's got to
[1:58:23] die first if the if a grain of wheat
[1:58:26] ever expect to live it's totally
[1:58:29] impossible for it it says that corn it
[1:58:33] says that wheat that flow the tree the
[1:58:36] grass the veget the vegetable everything
[1:58:40] ex expect to live again must die first
[1:58:44] then how are you going to how are you
[1:58:45] going to escape it you've got to die
[1:58:48] first you got to die how to your self
[1:58:52] die to everything to it says so that you
[1:58:56] can be born again you've got to do that
[1:58:59] if you don't die you can't live
[1:59:06] again it's what we
[1:59:09] need we we don't want
[1:59:12] to continue to try to dress this old man
[1:59:15] and try to make excuses on why he not
[1:59:18] doing the word of God but R calls it a
[1:59:22] sticky
[1:59:24] nature it's a sticky nature this flesh
[1:59:28] is born from sin and it cannot be saved
[1:59:31] there's a soul in there that God wants
[1:59:34] to come and save and then it says he he
[1:59:37] that is born Earthly that born of the
[1:59:40] carnal cannot overcome the spiritual
[1:59:42] things it says you have to be born from
[1:59:44] above you have to be born new from above
[1:59:47] in order for you to overcome that it
[1:59:49] says a new paragraph 94 a new nature a
[1:59:53] new birth a new creation nature they
[1:59:57] says the nature of your father he says
[2:00:00] you have you you you believe and you you
[2:00:03] it says and you believe and you love
[2:00:06] every word that he said every it says
[2:00:09] every man's
[2:00:11] word Every Man's word is a lie contrary
[2:00:14] to the word it says this is God's word
[2:00:16] see the Bible's right it says I don't
[2:00:19] care what the church says the Bible is
[2:00:21] STO right to you it says because your
[2:00:24] Nature's been
[2:00:26] changed now and if you've got a Church
[2:00:30] Father you will believe in the church in
[2:00:32] that church father but if you got father
[2:00:36] God you'll believe in God's word am and
[2:00:40] if you got a father in the church you'll
[2:00:43] believe that because you are his you are
[2:00:46] of his nature that that's your father
[2:00:50] because if your father if your father
[2:00:52] father if God his father's God then you
[2:00:55] believe God's word if you are if you are
[2:00:58] Church you believe his word if you are
[2:01:01] his church you believe his word you
[2:01:03] believe the church world you believe the
[2:01:05] church word you believe what the church
[2:01:07] said but if you are born again then
[2:01:10] you'll believe what God said because
[2:01:12] God's your father not the world or or
[2:01:17] church
[2:01:19] Creed the Holy Ghost he
[2:01:23] says baptize you into the body for
[2:01:29] service but you believe unto eternal
[2:01:34] life he
[2:01:36] says my
[2:01:38] word and I believe and and believeth he
[2:01:42] says he that believe he that Hearth my
[2:01:44] word and Believe on him that send me has
[2:01:46] eternal life then you are baptized by
[2:01:49] the Holy Spirit into the body of
[2:01:52] of into the body for the manifestation
[2:01:54] of the gifts and so forth but you
[2:01:57] believe to you believe to eternal life
[2:02:00] and he that believeth has eternal life
[2:02:03] and when you believe you when you
[2:02:06] believe is when you are dead and you are
[2:02:09] born and regenerated a new cre a new
[2:02:13] creature all
[2:02:17] right let me just say this
[2:02:38] it's
[2:02:40] important for us to pay close attention
[2:02:44] on what we are
[2:02:49] building my heart desire this morning
[2:02:53] is I want to be built upon Christ and
[2:02:57] Christ
[2:03:00] Alone the scripture will speak
[2:03:03] upon the wise men and the foolish men
[2:03:07] Matthew 7 and
[2:03:09] 24 and it will say and
[2:03:12] whosoever heareth this saying of mine
[2:03:16] and do with
[2:03:17] them I will liken unto him unto I liken
[2:03:21] him unto a wise man which built this
[2:03:23] house upon a
[2:03:25] rock and the rain descended and the
[2:03:27] flood came and the winds blew and beat
[2:03:30] up the house and it fell not for it was
[2:03:35] founded upon a
[2:03:37] rock and everyone that Hearth this
[2:03:39] saying of mine and doeth them not shall
[2:03:42] be liken unto a foolish man which build
[2:03:46] this house upon a sand and the rain
[2:03:49] descended and the flood came
[2:03:52] and the winds
[2:03:53] blew and blew upon the house and it fell
[2:03:57] and great was a fall of
[2:04:00] it
[2:04:02] so if you see one that's lacking unto a
[2:04:06] wise
[2:04:07] man it's the combination of hearing and
[2:04:13] doing they were both given the
[2:04:16] same Foundation to build upon which was
[2:04:19] the word
[2:04:23] but it's one who actually hear us and go
[2:04:26] and
[2:04:28] does is the one who's liken unto the one
[2:04:31] the wise men but to hear without an
[2:04:36] application is liken unto the foolish
[2:04:40] one and that has nothing to do with the
[2:04:42] word and and its ability to build a
[2:04:45] foundation it's
[2:04:47] there now
[2:04:49] remember the flood will come come that's
[2:04:53] not a question the rain will
[2:04:56] come but it's our ability to make sure
[2:04:59] that we are building upon the right
[2:05:01] foundation that is
[2:05:03] counting is our discernment to make sure
[2:05:05] that I am putting precept upon precept
[2:05:09] word upon word I am putting the word of
[2:05:12] God always before me like David said
[2:05:14] I've always set your word before me that
[2:05:16] I will not sin against you it's one who
[2:05:19] said that I will walk by the promises of
[2:05:21] God no matter how little I have because
[2:05:24] I know that when the flood will come God
[2:05:27] will protect me when I know when the
[2:05:29] winds will blow he will protect me when
[2:05:32] I know that when times will change when
[2:05:35] when challenges will come God will
[2:05:38] protect me David said in Psalm 18 and2
[2:05:41] it says the Lord is my rock and my
[2:05:44] Fortress and my deliverer my God my
[2:05:48] strength in whom I will trust my Buckler
[2:05:52] my and the Horn of my salvation and my
[2:05:56] high
[2:05:58] tower I love that they said the Lord is
[2:06:02] my rock that's the foundation under
[2:06:04] which I want to understand is my
[2:06:06] Fortress is my protection he my
[2:06:08] deliverer he my God he my strength in
[2:06:13] whom I will trust he's my
[2:06:17] Buckler and the Horn of my salvation
[2:06:21] and
[2:06:22] said in Psalm 62 and7 it says he is only
[2:06:27] my rock and my salvation he is my
[2:06:31] defense I have no defense of my own I
[2:06:34] have no protection I don't make
[2:06:36] provision for myself I don't go out and
[2:06:39] say well if the Lord doesn't do I got
[2:06:42] this
[2:06:44] discovered and I think that's what we do
[2:06:46] most of the time I'm going to ask but
[2:06:49] just in case God doesn't answer I got to
[2:06:51] way
[2:06:57] out is there somebody will say I will
[2:07:00] stand up and I will die if it doesn't
[2:07:02] answer and I'm okay to
[2:07:04] die is somebody will say God I'm
[2:07:06] standing here I am the scripture says if
[2:07:10] the Watchman of the house doesn't watch
[2:07:13] then all of our efforts are in vain if
[2:07:17] the Watchman doesn't stand there to
[2:07:19] watch and to protect every everything is
[2:07:22] in
[2:07:24] vain who's the Watchman he's the
[2:07:27] Watchman it's not our intelligence and
[2:07:29] our ability to uh uh Escape you know oh
[2:07:35] I got out of that just right in time
[2:07:38] like really you don't think there was a
[2:07:42] Watchman oh I escaped death in that
[2:07:44] accident oh if I didn't turn I just turn
[2:07:47] around in time really you don't think
[2:07:49] there was a Watchman
[2:07:52] oh I was about to be operated on and you
[2:07:55] know all the last minute somebody just
[2:07:56] asked let's go do I escaped that
[2:08:00] really there was a
[2:08:02] Watchman and if the Watchman doesn't do
[2:08:05] the job all our efforts are in vain
[2:08:08] butam says this in the message the
[2:08:10] spoken word it's original life I love
[2:08:12] this I'm coming to an end here it said I
[2:08:15] can I can paragraph 177 says how can you
[2:08:19] plant wheat here and we there and say
[2:08:22] I'm going to get
[2:08:25] cucumber think about
[2:08:26] it how can we constantly plant the world
[2:08:31] and the things of the world and
[2:08:33] constantly plant our intellect and
[2:08:35] expect to receive something else you
[2:08:38] know isn't that what they're calling
[2:08:39] sanity how can we do one thing and
[2:08:42] expect a different result it says it
[2:08:45] says and and whe here and cucumber here
[2:08:47] it says whe here you can't do that the
[2:08:51] only way way you got to do to get
[2:08:53] cucumber is to plant
[2:08:55] cucumber if you hybrid it it won't it
[2:08:59] says it won't it won't be a cucumber
[2:09:02] he'll be a hypocrite is that right he'll
[2:09:05] be a hypocrite friend you says you it'll
[2:09:07] be it'll be a hypocrite friend just got
[2:09:09] to say it it says it's neither one it's
[2:09:12] it isn't cucumber and what you when you
[2:09:15] I with it it says it's a it's a
[2:09:18] crossbreed it's a bad product it's dead
[2:09:21] to it in itself and it can't breed
[2:09:24] itself back uh no more it's dead right
[2:09:28] right there back he says he won't go
[2:09:30] back farther he says that's finished
[2:09:33] that finishes it he says that's all but
[2:09:36] if you want a cucumber start with
[2:09:40] cucumber I love the next one if you want
[2:09:44] a church start with the word of God
[2:09:52] if you want a church start with the word
[2:09:54] of God how many believe they are the
[2:09:56] Church of God this morning amen did you
[2:09:58] start with
[2:10:01] intellect did you come up with your own
[2:10:05] conclusion on how God was going to did
[2:10:07] you come up with a program on how God
[2:10:09] needs to save you no you were saved by a
[2:10:12] supernatural Way by a supernatural event
[2:10:15] God came and he revealed himself to you
[2:10:17] it says and if you want a church you
[2:10:19] want a church you start with with the
[2:10:21] word of God it says you want a life of
[2:10:24] God start with the word of God accept
[2:10:27] the word of God in its fullness every
[2:10:30] measure of it and then let and then it
[2:10:33] says and if it's the fullness of uh if
[2:10:35] it's the fullness of God in you then it
[2:10:39] will it will then the rain will fall it
[2:10:41] will produce exactly what's in your
[2:10:45] guarden thank you Lord God I want to
[2:10:48] plant the word of God on my heart I want
[2:10:50] to plant every promise that you said it
[2:10:52] will be I want to prant the the end time
[2:10:55] word of God in my heart I want to prant
[2:10:58] everything that you promise so that when
[2:11:00] the rain will fall the only thing I can
[2:11:03] produce is the word of God why because
[2:11:06] that's what's been planted there's no
[2:11:09] hybridation I planted it I'm going to
[2:11:12] skip so I can get towards the end he
[2:11:14] says
[2:11:16] here he it says here
[2:11:32] let me read this and then I'll jump
[2:11:33] through the last scripture it
[2:11:35] says in the church age the uh uh Pilgrim
[2:11:40] in church AG says now Jesus knew that
[2:11:43] there was going to be a terrible drift
[2:11:45] away from the word in the pous age which
[2:11:48] was as yet 200 years off from the patma
[2:11:53] vision he says he knew that drift would
[2:11:56] cause them to go into the dark age he
[2:11:59] knew that he knew that the way it says
[2:12:02] that that the way may originally go away
[2:12:05] from the word from God by the first uh
[2:12:09] leaving the word it says and if you
[2:12:11] leave if you leave that word you have
[2:12:14] left
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] God if you leave the word you have left
[2:12:20] God
[2:12:22] and I think we sometimes associate god
[2:12:25] with our emotion rather than the reality
[2:12:29] God is not our emotion it's not because
[2:12:32] I feel like God is there then he's there
[2:12:35] you may feel it you may not feel it God
[2:12:37] is the promise whether you feel it don't
[2:12:40] feel it is there amen if he's giving you
[2:12:42] the promise is there so you can't live
[2:12:45] the word of God with your emotion and
[2:12:48] think that God is still there no you
[2:12:49] have left them
[2:12:53] did talk about the artisian W it said
[2:12:57] you can cry all you want and says oh
[2:13:00] great water he says let flow in this
[2:13:04] direction no it's against the
[2:13:07] law it won't
[2:13:10] work it had you have to go according to
[2:13:13] the law of God in other words you have
[2:13:16] to go according to the word of God and
[2:13:18] how do you go you say God you said in
[2:13:21] your scripture that if one was a sinner
[2:13:23] will come that he will pray he said like
[2:13:26] like Jonah said that once more when I
[2:13:29] look towards the temple in Jerusalem and
[2:13:31] said when I'll pray you will hear my
[2:13:33] prayer now we're talking it says once
[2:13:36] more will I look towards the temple and
[2:13:38] when I'll pray you will hear my prayer
[2:13:40] why you are now coming to stand upon the
[2:13:43] law and God is obligated to he that's
[2:13:46] why he said when you are sick what do
[2:13:47] you do you find the word of God you find
[2:13:50] an example in the Bible in the message
[2:13:53] you said God this one came and it was SI
[2:13:56] they had this condition I come by the
[2:13:58] same token if God has ever done one
[2:14:01] thing one way he's obligated to do it
[2:14:03] again so when you leave the word you
[2:14:06] leave God so what we need is not to go
[2:14:08] by our emotion but he constantly come
[2:14:11] back to the word of God it's always come
[2:14:13] back however bad we feel you got to come
[2:14:17] back and find your condition in the word
[2:14:19] of God find the satisfying condition for
[2:14:22] God to come on the scene for
[2:14:27] you he even said he's going to heal you
[2:14:31] and he's going to ask you where you need
[2:14:32] healing
[2:14:36] for sorry I don't want to take to out
[2:14:38] time it says you left God
[2:14:43] thus he is presenting himself to the
[2:14:46] church at pilgrimage and indeed all the
[2:14:49] church ages I am the word it says if you
[2:14:53] want deity in your midst then welcome
[2:14:57] and receive the
[2:15:00] Worden don't ever let any
[2:15:04] anyone or anything gets between you and
[2:15:10] that
[2:15:11] word not your family not your children
[2:15:14] not your job not your business not your
[2:15:17] wife not your children anybody don't let
[2:15:20] between you and I nothing between my
[2:15:23] savior and I why because if you do that
[2:15:26] then you will protect your family you
[2:15:28] will protect your wife you will protect
[2:15:30] everything you'll protect your job they
[2:15:32] will look and say well we got to lay off
[2:15:34] everybody you know like uh you know if
[2:15:36] you work for Amazon right now and trying
[2:15:38] to decide whether you're going to go to
[2:15:40] the office or not you know they're
[2:15:41] trying to find all of that if you put
[2:15:43] your trust on the word of God they can
[2:15:45] lay everybody off but if that job is
[2:15:49] yours God will keep you right there
[2:15:53] they'll look and say well we added the
[2:15:55] name on the list that disappear why
[2:15:57] because you have a watching a guiding
[2:15:59] angel watching over you let me just
[2:16:02] finish up with this the scripture will
[2:16:04] say if we could turn our Bibles I want
[2:16:07] you to just turn your scripture in
[2:16:08] Ezekiel 36 because brother Ram uses this
[2:16:11] scripture in why so many Christians find
[2:16:14] it hard to live the Christian Life and
[2:16:16] will end with it I I was just blessed
[2:16:19] just looking at the scripture and I want
[2:16:21] to say this before I read it this is the
[2:16:24] foundation for your life from the
[2:16:26] beginning till this
[2:16:29] time this is the foundation on how God
[2:16:32] is building his church how God is
[2:16:35] building his Believers and how God is
[2:16:38] building his kingdom you want to know
[2:16:40] how God is operating and how he's
[2:16:42] building his people what Foundation to
[2:16:45] stand on look at Ezekiel let's start
[2:16:48] from verse 22 he says there therefore
[2:16:51] say unto the house of Israel thou sayth
[2:16:54] the Lord I do I do I do I do not this
[2:17:00] for your sake oh House of Israel but for
[2:17:03] my holy s my holy name's sake which he
[2:17:06] have profane among the Heathen wherewith
[2:17:10] ye went my brother my sister we need to
[2:17:14] understand that life is not just about
[2:17:17] our you know we go about and says oh oh
[2:17:21] I wish I was this I was this you got to
[2:17:23] understand that you are part of the
[2:17:25] bigger plan that God is trying to put
[2:17:28] together you are only a piece of the
[2:17:31] puzzle in God's Great economy it's not
[2:17:34] just about you it's about what God is
[2:17:36] trying to do he says I'm doing this not
[2:17:40] for you but for my name's sake I want
[2:17:42] the nation to hear about me I want
[2:17:45] people to hear about my healing I want
[2:17:48] people to hear about my Deliverance I
[2:17:50] have a SE down there I'm not doing
[2:17:52] that's why sometimes when we look at
[2:17:54] ourselves and beat ourselves in the
[2:17:55] mirror all time we forgetting that
[2:17:58] there's a bigger picture there's one
[2:18:00] that has everything under control and
[2:18:02] it's not necessarily about you it's
[2:18:04] about what he trying to
[2:18:07] achieve you know imagine you know a a
[2:18:11] husband walking in and say I want to
[2:18:13] marry a person going to want to May
[2:18:15] marry a wife and find out that you are
[2:18:18] only a piece of the puzzle that the
[2:18:19] woman was looking for
[2:18:22] for well that would be
[2:18:25] terrible you know because it's the wife
[2:18:28] that's supposed to be the part of the
[2:18:29] puzzle of the husband it's the husband
[2:18:32] who has the plan but today you find you
[2:18:35] know women that have a plan you know I
[2:18:37] want to live this kind of life I want
[2:18:39] this kind of houses they just looking
[2:18:41] for somebody to finance
[2:18:45] it imagine you find that out what a
[2:18:48] disappointment
[2:18:51] and sometimes I believe that's how we
[2:18:53] treat God we create this own world that
[2:18:56] we want to live in how we want our life
[2:18:58] to be we oh we don't want any trials we
[2:19:02] want to go to heaven free like no
[2:19:05] temptation
[2:19:06] nothing who's building that
[2:19:10] house it's not about you it's about God
[2:19:14] the scripture says God will not share
[2:19:16] his glory with
[2:19:18] anybody we we partake of the glory glory
[2:19:21] of God when we become God when that's
[2:19:24] why the new birth is so important
[2:19:26] because what the new birth does it takes
[2:19:28] the mind that was in Christ and he
[2:19:30] places it in you what Christ like you
[2:19:33] start to
[2:19:36] like that's why when a wife marries a
[2:19:39] husband it's not the husband turning
[2:19:41] towards what the wife or the need of the
[2:19:43] wife it's the wife falling in love with
[2:19:46] the husband and everything that the
[2:19:47] husband
[2:19:49] like so he said that I'm not doing this
[2:19:52] just for your sake I you you have a part
[2:19:55] to play I've called you and I want you
[2:19:57] to understand this but I want you to
[2:19:59] know this is bigger than you this I'm
[2:20:02] doing this for my name's sake I'm doing
[2:20:06] it so the nation the the my name that he
[2:20:09] have profane that the nation will know
[2:20:12] I'm doing this so that you can
[2:20:14] understand that you are a piece of the
[2:20:16] puzzle of what I'm trying to do I'm
[2:20:18] doing it for my glory is God putting the
[2:20:21] picture together it's not us putting the
[2:20:27] picture he continues on it continues on
[2:20:31] and it says verse 23 it says I will
[2:20:34] sanctify my great name which ye have ye
[2:20:38] which was profane among the Heathen
[2:20:41] which ye have profaned in the midst of
[2:20:43] them and then it says and the hidden
[2:20:45] shall know that I am the Lord sayeth the
[2:20:48] Lord God I shall be San ify in you
[2:20:52] before the
[2:20:54] rise it's God's sanctification in The
[2:20:58] Believer before the hidden it's not your
[2:21:01] own sanctification but it's his
[2:21:03] sanctification it's for his name's sake
[2:21:06] is for what he's trying to achieve
[2:21:08] that's why the best thing we can say for
[2:21:10] ourself is be it unto me according to
[2:21:13] Thy word it's not me trying to force
[2:21:15] things up it's just say God whatever you
[2:21:18] want I'll take it whatever Road you have
[2:21:20] for me I'll go the way it's not you
[2:21:23] trying to come up with your own plan for
[2:21:25] your own Redemption it's his
[2:21:28] Redemption it's saying it's he said but
[2:21:31] that sanctification of God will be
[2:21:33] manifested through your flesh God is
[2:21:36] going to come and do it through you so
[2:21:39] the nation the hidden that you have
[2:21:42] profaned the name before will know that
[2:21:44] there's a God that exists in 24 it says
[2:21:47] for I will take you from among the
[2:21:50] hidden and gather you out of all the
[2:21:53] countries all countries and will bring
[2:21:56] you into my own land god came into the
[2:22:00] world the scripture says ye that were
[2:22:03] part of the children of disobedient one
[2:22:05] time you were part of in the world God
[2:22:08] has gathered you together as a hand
[2:22:10] gathers his children so you could be a
[2:22:13] people that's called aside for his own
[2:22:15] sake for his name's sake he's calling us
[2:22:18] so we can manifest to him
[2:22:21] he's doing this for his own name's sake
[2:22:24] he's Gathering us from every country
[2:22:27] those that he had elected to be here and
[2:22:30] he says that to your own land oh God
[2:22:34] thank you for the land of promise thank
[2:22:37] you for Luke 17:30 thank you for
[2:22:39] Revelation 10:7 thank you for the why it
[2:22:42] says those those promises has open up to
[2:22:46] the Believers a new land that we can
[2:22:48] live under it says then I will sprinkle
[2:22:51] clean water upon you ye shall be clean
[2:22:54] from all your filthiness and from all
[2:22:57] your Idols I will clean you it's not a
[2:23:01] Believer cleaning himself it's God
[2:23:03] cleaning the believer if you can ever
[2:23:06] understand that it's the love of God
[2:23:08] that save you you would have a different
[2:23:11] understanding about yourself we can't
[2:23:13] save ourself we can't do good to our own
[2:23:16] self in fact even when we try to do good
[2:23:19] we end up doing the wrong it's God who
[2:23:21] does good to
[2:23:23] you I will call you out I will sanctify
[2:23:27] you I will give you a land I will give
[2:23:30] you all that you have I'll be your
[2:23:32] provider I'll give you if you don't have
[2:23:34] bread I'll give you bread it's God's
[2:23:37] doing he said I will sanctify you that's
[2:23:41] why I said earlier on a Believer is not
[2:23:44] one that comes and say well I'll
[2:23:45] sanctify myself then I become he says no
[2:23:48] that's not the way to do it because the
[2:23:50] next verse it says a new heart will I
[2:23:53] also give you I will give you a new
[2:23:56] spirit and I will put my spirit into
[2:23:59] your spirit I will take away the Stony
[2:24:02] hearts of Flesh the Stony hearts out of
[2:24:05] your flesh and then I will give you a
[2:24:08] heart of Flesh God building the
[2:24:13] believer at the end it's his testimony
[2:24:18] being lived through US amen
[2:24:25] we walk around
[2:24:26] and some feel like they've achieved
[2:24:29] their own
[2:24:30] achievement praise God I'm a Believer
[2:24:34] praise God I believe the message of the
[2:24:36] hour those are
[2:24:37] hidden he called you among from the
[2:24:41] heathens you were not different we're
[2:24:43] not different from the people walking on
[2:24:45] the street that's
[2:24:46] right we we could have been those people
[2:24:50] in a moment notice we could have been if
[2:24:53] if it wasn't for the love of God if it
[2:24:55] wasn't for the election of God we could
[2:24:58] have been the church down the street and
[2:25:00] guess what we'll be preaching we are
[2:25:02] right that's
[2:25:04] right you think they think they're
[2:25:07] wrong what a
[2:25:11] deception you could only have seen the
[2:25:13] message because he open your eyes to it
[2:25:16] if the musician could come he says and I
[2:25:18] will put my spirit with continue I will
[2:25:21] cause you to walk in my statue and ye
[2:25:25] shall keep my judgment and do them and
[2:25:29] let me say this you couldn't obey the
[2:25:31] word of God if you wanted
[2:25:37] to but says it's not even by
[2:25:44] sincerity you're not a son of God
[2:25:46] because you are sincere you become
[2:25:49] sincere in the
[2:25:50] process it's not by there's more people
[2:25:53] that are more sincere more loving more
[2:25:57] kindness more everything but God didn't
[2:25:59] choose them he chose you this morning
[2:26:02] why is so we can come let me say this I
[2:26:05] say the celebration at the end is when
[2:26:08] we play the pictures of everything that
[2:26:10] is done and how that he came along and
[2:26:13] what he done for us how that he took us
[2:26:15] out of sin how that he protected us from
[2:26:17] death when we can understand the love of
[2:26:20] God that's been shed abroad for us
[2:26:22] that's the thing that makes us more
[2:26:26] happy he said I will cause you the only
[2:26:30] reason you do the works of God is
[2:26:32] because God allows you to do it God
[2:26:36] placed something in your heart remember
[2:26:39] the law was set up so that so much so
[2:26:43] that flesh no flesh was able to fulfill
[2:26:46] it even the very Pharisees that washed
[2:26:50] the pots and pens and everything but
[2:26:52] when the the but Jesus looked at them
[2:26:54] and says unless your righteousness
[2:26:56] exceed this
[2:26:59] righteousness it wasn't about the
[2:27:01] righteousness what was it about it was
[2:27:04] about God's choice God choosing those
[2:27:07] people that oh your disciples they don't
[2:27:09] wash their hands and look at them and
[2:27:11] all of that well what was the difference
[2:27:13] there were chosen but the others were
[2:27:15] not
[2:27:20] that's the foundation God wants us to
[2:27:22] stand on let's all stand this
[2:27:25] [Applause]
[2:27:32] morning and then it says and he shall
[2:27:35] dwell in the
[2:27:37] land that I gave to your father and ye
[2:27:41] shall be my
[2:27:43] people and I will be your
[2:27:46] God let me say this morning
[2:27:50] I don't want to stand up on my own
[2:27:52] understanding I don't want to stand up
[2:27:54] on My Own Foundation I say this morning
[2:27:57] I want to stand on the foundation that
[2:27:59] he has built I want my life every day
[2:28:03] when I make a decision I want to be
[2:28:05] mindful that there's a foundation that's
[2:28:08] been laid for me and that's the
[2:28:10] foundation I need to work on I want when
[2:28:12] I think I want when I meet the challenge
[2:28:14] I want when I fail I want when I do
[2:28:17] wrong to be mindful of the foundation
[2:28:19] and say it's not myself Lord you have
[2:28:22] given me a foundation a place that I can
[2:28:25] stand let me say this we struggle so
[2:28:28] much but says there's so much ups and
[2:28:30] downs in the Christian life and all of
[2:28:32] that he said then the reason is we need
[2:28:35] to be born again and I don't mean to say
[2:28:38] you don't have the Holy Spirit we need
[2:28:41] to continually die it's not a one-time
[2:28:44] process it's a daily dying it's the
[2:28:47] daily surrendering it's the Daily
[2:28:49] Commitment it's the daily prayer it's
[2:28:51] the daily praying for that sweet Spirit
[2:28:54] to come over you it's the daily reading
[2:28:57] of the Bible and letting God reveal
[2:28:59] himself it's the daily inspiration what
[2:29:02] says that the Holy Spirit was sent to be
[2:29:05] let to let the church to lead the church
[2:29:08] but the problem is we are trying to lead
[2:29:09] ourselves every day we come up with our
[2:29:12] own plan I'm going to do this and then
[2:29:13] I'm this I'm going to we failed to take
[2:29:16] those friends to him and let him lead us
[2:29:19] he knows what we have need of he he's
[2:29:22] asking us he's only asking us to be
[2:29:25] built upon the foundation that he's
[2:29:27] given us why because heaven and earth
[2:29:29] will pass away but his word shall not
[2:29:32] pass
[2:29:33] away let's just bow our
[2:29:36] heads sorry looks like I went a little
[2:29:39] longer than I
[2:29:41] expected if you have a need upon your
[2:29:43] heart this
[2:29:45] morning may you just say on your heart
[2:29:47] and say Lord perhap perhaps I didn't
[2:29:50] walk on the foundation Foundation that
[2:29:53] you wanted me to walk
[2:29:56] on perhaps I didn't so many times make a
[2:30:00] decision based on that Foundation I I
[2:30:03] just trampled it and I walked away but
[2:30:06] Lord this morning I'm willing to come
[2:30:08] back to that
[2:30:09] Foundation Lord I built a house on the
[2:30:11] sand and I sent it crumbled time and
