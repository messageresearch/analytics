to take us [Music] or many times we have other plans but you so patiently place your hand on our lives to bring us to where that we have to be and one day you'll eternally take us from here that's what we long for we ask you to bless us tonight as we sit and fellowship around your word in the wonderful and precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you tonight let's let's turn back again to our scripture in malachi 4 and and just read that again and we're reading it uh that scripture uh just to you know again add that light to that statement that was read he said well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to prove it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then and then don't the bride have to do the same thing we have to be exactly what the word said she should be in these last days don't she have to return through malachi 4 don't you have to be manifested like it was in the days of sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us and so we read here it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse father we ask you to bless us this evening in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning i guess that uh most of us got that quickening power this morning and are no longer with us and uh and uh but that's okay but we're here and i don't know any place i'd rather be you know so we'll just rejoice maybe they knew we were going to listen to a little bit of tape tonight and and but you know it even with us preaching this morning we wouldn't have anything to preach without this you'd be hearing what's on every street corner everywhere but see i i i i feel that you know it it's hard because we have so many ideas that's been put in our heads for so long that part of what god has to do is filter everything out you know and he put had to put paul on the back side of the desert to get everything out of him he had to put moses in the wilderness just to filter everything out because you know you have certain things and they become definitions to you and then you use those thoughts to so you use your thoughts to hear and and that's why it has to be beyond what you hear it has to be understanding by revelation and that you know as we're we were uh you know reading so we read malachi and ev everybody mostly reached that scripture and thinks that he's talking about being restored back to to the pentecost when they went into the upper room and and really if if you notice when they went to the upper room jesus had told them something basically he told them go out and do the works that i do because the works i do you shall do also. he said go out there and forgive them of their sins you know who's you know i mean what you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what you lose shall be loosed and and you you cast out devils and whose sins you forgive they shall be forgiven that is absolutely him himself passing on all the authority he had to them and we know that satan took that into the ground so a lot of times when we think about being you know being restored we just look like going back to the apostles but this restoration goes way farther back amen because what what the restoration of what pentecost was or what people think happened at the upper room that's been tried to be duplicated and duplicated and manifested in so many different ways but this original can't be duplicated it doesn't go back any farther so we understand that we're not talking here about we're talking about justification sanctification baptism of the holy stone ghost but this is a step beyond that and this is what this message is it's more than just those three steps those three steps is what brought the church to the place to receive what was elected for them amen i tell you it sure is a comfort to me to sit back and finally really realize that he had me in his mind before the foundation of the world and the only reason i'm here is because he thought me and put me here and he made known to me amen i didn't figure it out i wasn't sitting in my chair one day reading my bible and read malachi 4 5 and said oh you know there's got to be a prophet coming this day no something showed up a light showed up and and there was a manifestation and a work done in the flesh and and we saw it and when we saw it meant something more to us than it did to somebody else when i first came into the message i remember going up to uh we are as you know we had a little commune and we went up to uh a place up the coast a little bit because a man wanted to talk to us about brother branham so we were very interested in so we went up and we went in his living room and we were all sitting there together and i can just visual it today and he came in and he had a picture of the pillar of fire and wow i mean i just lit up like a thing and he threw it on the table and in front of me and he said i've never seen such a fake in all my life and and you know i'm only like 20 you know 20 years old and you know but uh you know and i i just don't know how to express it anyway i just sat there and i literally saw the the ceiling of his house and everything caving in on him like from an earthquake and it wasn't just a day or two later that i listened to choosing of the bride but to him it meant nothing but for some reason it meant something to us and i you know i i appreciated again that the men's breakfast it was such a wonderful time of fellowship many people have grown up in the message but god always has a way of taking it to you personally where it it it it just comes down to where you see it and and then you see what maybe your parents saw maybe you see more than what your parents saw they may be they may be in a different hour of labor than that you've been in but you're in a wonderful time so this is something that it we're not talking about something that has happened we are in the happening you understand that that that that addition that the part that's added to the baptism of the holy spirit to that word to that third pull that distribution of of the the your abstract in other words who you were in his mind or the foundation of the world it's being presented to us and can you may not be there uh yet but but just keep going you understand he'll get you there and if if he comes before you reach that place he'll bring it with him amen he'll finish the work in you and so alls we can do is just is is take one step at a time press for the higher calling that you know let our light shine walk in all the light we have receive correction from the holy spirit as he brings it to be humble you know the zeal for this age is be zealous and repent you know to say you're sorry to make things right but don't ever let satan rob you in other words he can try to take your title from you but you can just remember i've got an abstract that's going to back this title up and when and i'm waiting for it to arrive in the mail and when it does you are never going to be able to set foot on my land again amen so we're just going to listen uh uh to i think it's about 28 minutes and so we're going to listen to what that we've heard and then he's going to uh well brother brahma is going to begin to mention um uh people in the scripture and he's pointing it as see look at what it did on them and and we we've got a great great uh law of god that's been shared with us if god ever does one thing one way he's got to continue to do it if anybody's ever approached him on a certain ground and in a certain way and he gave them a certain answer if you approach him on that same ground you will get identically the same answer amen it may be customized to you personally but the end result is the same he's not improving i like that you know god's not improving he's he was what he was he's the i am not the i will be or the i was he says i am everything that we are came from him and that's why he's alpha and omega i'm the beginning of it i'm the end of it i'm the beginning of you and i'm the end of you i like that i come from god i go to god amen what a glorious resurrection so let's just enjoy uh the word of god i i i sit here this evening and i think you know we want to we want to build a little bigger building and and i we listened to a statue of a perfect man in in the first paragraph in the statue of a perfect man brother brown begins to talk about all the trouble that he's having getting the to the church remodeled he said we bring it to him and they send it back and we take it to somebody else and they tell us no and they send it over here well i i got a note from my uh our civil engineer who's working with the city he says we've got everything down he said but now the fire marshal is uh changing his mind from what he told us originally and he wanted they agreed to have 25 foot turn radiuses and so but now the fire marshal wants to go back to 30. and but i just think that we've got that problem solved we were going to have a we're talking with the trustees and the deacons about it but we were going to put a balcony in but i really don't think that's necessary we can add those balcony seats on the main floor and have the building look a little more comfortable and not so gigantic and we still will be able to see 400 people so you're going to feel awful little in that building so you're going to have to come right up front and get right in because if we scatter all out over that but maybe god will just start moving on more harm amen i i i was really moved this morning with the uh people that have come up from prayer and it was people that i've never seen before but the they were really moved by the spirit of god the spirit of god was really touching hearts uh he was doing for him a lot of times i'll ask what people are praying for but i didn't feel to ask because i knew he was here and he knew and the scripture says that he knows what you have need of even before you act so it you know if you if it didn't seem like i wanted to hear what you had to say i just felt in my heart he already knew it and and if he knew it before you even ask it i'm kind of out of the picture and i want to be out of the picture i'm trying to live to get out of the picture if you know what i mean but i know you'll certainly enjoy this if you have a way to read the message or you can read it on the board or if you have something in i believe we're going to start it paragraph 225 and we're just going to pick up uh there and uh and uh and listen for uh the did i say did i say 225 yeah 220 yeah 225 and we're just gonna listen from there about 28 minutes and then we'll just uh just point out a few little things maybe that step out up to us and and we'll move forward so keep me in prayer for next weekend i'm preaching sunday morning a brother i believe ron lilly's going to be speaking there at the meetings and i think it's uh brother ben beard i believe is preaching and and then i have sunday morning so you're welcome to come if you would like i think billy will be here brother randy will be out of town on on vacation i guess winning souls in ohio matthew and cosmin will be in romania so billy can do too and it'll be good amen it's always been a blessing for my soul i'm excited about what the lord has i really am i it's just that uh i believe we we've tried and tried to press ourselves into this place but i think it's coming exactly according to his timing that people are re really you're actually going to see miracles in your works and things that you've desired manifesting and it's not going to be a big show he said this was done kind of in a secret place you know what i mean that god god put it all before the people and they rejected it now it's for those that accepted it so enjoy this little 28 minute site to me i love listening to tapes i i honestly listen to tapes by myself but then when i listen to them sitting here with you there's a whole another added richness to it and it makes me feel a part of something that is real just not me listening to a tape the word but when i listen to it with you it makes me feel part of something that's greater than than anything so god bless you uh this evening as we enjoy god's word thank you the quickness power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them and not only the dynamics come into quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what i mean they were so quick and until their tongues began to speak in another language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of christ until they laid their hands they were so quick and with quickening power to when they laid their hands up on the stick they got well they're quickened your mortal body man they were healed by laying on their hands and the spirit clicking their fellowships together with god so they also were so quick and into the presence of god until when a person died and their soul and goal it called him back to life sorry i'm feeling religious that's right not only was his resurrection for himself but whosoever will to this predestinated season that the men are quickened christians are more about they lay hands on the sick they recover they prayed in the spirit of salvation call the dead back to life that's right quicken their immortal body and if it comes into you if it be so now you can say it so but if it be so these signs follow them it quickens your mortal body it'll quicken you now notice it put them into the presence of god why it was the spirit of god that raised up jesus from the grave and the spirit of god are given that eternal life comes from the greek word if you look up zoe which moves it through you and then quickens their even their mind how can you say that that spirit dwells in you though you've done everything that you thought was right here's your evidence when you got it or not if the spirit that was in christ is in you it also quickens you to the word for he is the word and if it contrary quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ sure what you've done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word i was talking about today my own mother she's going on now and she was a very odd woman and she was you know about the indian and she was um but in there she was a person who didn't dream but i don't think she don't have four or five dreams all of her life but every time she dreamed the dream it was true she had a dream it was true i remember one time i first started preaching many years ago we're living right up here on the road right just above yours i was preaching higher this church she dreamed the dream that i was standing here by the side of a three step and i was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway and on the highways a little pearly likes white line run right into the the doors of heaven to the pearly gates and that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps if that ain't my message exactly today justification of sanctification and i was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway and said that there was a lady came by now you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago was the lady come by i have a great big pair of the occasion to wear today spike your shoes and she come by and i said wait my sister you can't walk that highway there and i said you you can't be here and she said she said i'll show you i can be justified sanctified and deal with the holy ghost still walking and she i just let her go couldn't do more about it couldn't stop her and she jumped up on the highway to look back the sister said yeah i told you she started to run up and she you know what the bible says in isaiah fifth chapter that it has outstretched necks they have to pitch over see missing as you have to accurate missing as you go making a tinkling with her heels the daughter's design in the last thing and she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and eduardo bro got narrow in there she started reeling missing like that and off she mother said the harvest scream that i ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down down like that i turn around said see she just obeyed everything but one word everything but one word sure then it costs the women can be saved sanctified and deal with the holy ghost and then faith man shall not live up read along but by every word and she failed and i said see she went on in all right but she she failed to listen tell her what was ahead and he's wrote the gospel by the disciples apostles and doctrine doctrines apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen now lord this quickening power is zoning bringing the word the mind that was in christ within you then i'm trying to show you that you when you uh raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickened your life with him you are now quick in the life although banned you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god had saw all in him at the finish see when god looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden against him and he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which is human flesh and he didn't if he went up there as god he never died that kind of death thank kill god but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeeming that one body see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks to the rhyme well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to prove it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards that don't the group the bride has to do the same thing has to be exactly what the word said should be in these last days don't you have to return to knowledge before don't you have to be manifested like what's the days of sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us my friends i know i'm keeping a long time 15 minutes just so dinner but maybe i'll get super damn but notice looky here what a perfect thing it is i don't know when to sing against me look notice it but god foresaw the bride in the room hallelujah see to save his wife like adam he had to go with her i didn't know what he was doing he didn't know what she was doing but adam walked out with his wife see and jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we unite how can we do anything but love him friends uh she could stay on ours but let's move on apart like uh the pentecostal experience today and the coming of the holy ghost in this last days as promised is like the abstract to a title these see now you can get a title sure okay you can get a title to a place but that's still gonna say it's yours no sir somebody way back energy come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract shows that everything is ever against it is struck off coming back from the foundation is that right and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract then every bit of that belongs to you and everything's on it belongs to you hey and that gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this titled eve that god saw by god for the foundation of the world and put a name on the book of life but was born to a man and woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when i believed on it i received the deed but when the holy ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it like a little epileptic childhood prayed for a few minutes ago to come to you from the grandparents therefore if she fell down and upon the child i said but when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything i'm uh abstract foreign amen and as sure as the spirit that raised christ from the dead i have an abstract deed that i'm part of that body with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body of word lit up just exactly like it did in him let's keep coming over that the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are structured by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that god give me by grace by foreign i'm here that was dead and alive again and i'm alive forevermore had the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing even beautiful let's go right quick now the abstract title the death is settled everything against it has been struck off glory i may act silly but i feel good do you realize what that means you realize what that means brother there's nothing to take it away from me amen i am a holder hey man what uh what why i have now cashed in on my beneficiary of his death burial and resurrection he become me that i might become him now he became a sinner that i might become a son amen amen holy abstract for these signs shall follow them and believe the abstract deed now quickly before we got about 10 minutes more let us now notice quickly the quickening of the spirit i'm going to show you some signs so that you'll understand look now watch what this quickening power was my subject as the sun has raised up look how it's done on them at pentecost what it did to them what that quickening power did to them it quickened them now let's notice what it did on stephen stevens is full of quickening power wasn't that right see he was full of quickening power it didn't make him scared he said you stiffness uncircumcised the heart and ears do you always resist the holy ghost like your father did so do you which one of the prophets has chosen for the coming of the just once in your father's stone oh my done something to him sure he is full of quickening power and they said we'll get rid of that guy and when he died just stone him and then pour power was working i see the heavens open and jesus standing at the right hand of god that's what quickly power done for stephen notice another fellow had just quickly powered his name is phillip he was so full of quickly power just have a great big meeting down in samara devils is being cast out people's baptized in the name of jesus christ just having a real meeting and the spirit spoke to him oh the dynamics come down and said leave this revival but while the minister said don't make any what they say he's full of quickening power he had the gasoline and the dynamics was falling upon him they go out into the desert and he found a eunuch there and baptized him in the name of jesus christ one man who took the message down to ethiopia is that right and you've obeyed god and old penis to god if you've ever been baptized in the name of jesus christ do it and watch your britney power pick you up there once stephen has done this great thing or not statements for philip does this great thing to leave that great revival and obey the commandments of god on his full filled box about baptizing this eunuch and obedience to god he was so full of cleansing power to call him away it will quicken your immortal body if this spirit that raised up jesus from the dead it quick and fill up so he wasn't seen for maybe 150 miles or somewhere else for another country it quickened this mortal body how did you do it so full of equipment oh church of the living god we can't spend around your own little sugar tips that we're nursing around here today we've got to be full and played up with quickly power until the quickening of the holy ghost we got to be caught away someday in that rapture hey man oh my excuse that expression i think about a mother that makes those little facts three suits for the babies some of the old man is remember the little baby gets his fallen take some coffee grounds and some sugar wrapped up in a sack let him suck on it just a pacifier there's no strength in that but skinny a little caffeine in there and stuff a little sweetened and making it far down and getting caffeine we are tired of that stuff is that get back your eagles back to the word of god be fairly nothing can hurt your feelings you're free from all the scandal of man whatever anybody says against you that just brings more [Music] quickening power caught away into the heavenlies the eagle is done through above the chickens way up down there in the heavenly places in christ jesus oh it was owned phillips that quickened and caught him away let's take another man there was a man by the name of enoch and he had walked with every word of god for about 500 years he had a testimony that i haven't one time failed his word he got the full of the quickness power when the dynamics hit him on that mechanic he didn't even have to die he just took it apart just started walking he said like phil if he got to pull it quick and power still going over to going to another place where they found him up to the upper coast to there he says that way he was like well i said i'm an old man anyhow i just got so much quicker fire just walk around here that's the same quickly power that we have right now see it will quicken your mortal body isn't that right it's the quickening powers enoch with that perfect testimony that everything god told me to do i did it everything that i've seen he said for me to do i've done it and become so full of dynamics or or mechanics until when the quickening power struck in the mechanics it inflicted him right up he walked on out of the earth into heaven now now notice on elijah after he looked elijah that great prophet man and his excuse me brother sister in that day he had busted them painted base women then jesse bell and he had and stood until and nobody looked like stood with me and he rebuked and desired and stood out there and god is taking care of me and helped him in every place you know the old fella got tired one day he said i'm getting old so i just can't go as far as it's going to get 90 years old real old walking around there and he was so full of quick and tired you know what he looked across yards oh god i can almost see the other side against you soul full of equipment power until they see the chairs hooked over there some horses the fire chair the fire hooked to some tree over there he just walked across the river and went home without even dying the quickness power sent calls of chairs to come down from heaven and take him up he picked off his coat and thrown it back for elijah now trying now then that thought picked up that robe the tithe of the church picked up that roll now he'd done twice a miracle which is the type of christ in the church elijah done four he done eight now he was he was double the power because he asked for greater things for this that i do sure you do but he was so full of quickening power and everything until he done all these double what elijah done more than he did and noticed he lived the life on up to about 80 or 90 years old he got old and he he died he died and they took him out and buried him you know that quickly fired him many many years after that when the flesh had all rotted off his bones he was laying in a tube and they were packing a dead man one day and they saw the enemy and they just throw this man on top of elijah's motion so much quickening power when it was supposed to match up rested over that dirt hallelujah glory amen he that raised up christ from the hands lord all so quick in your immortal body the elijah back there elisha and elijah remember that dead man that prophet full of that quickening power rang in the grave and rotted away just so much quickly powerful sort of dead man honey come to life can still lay hands on the stick amen there you are and remember we are flesh of his flesh jesus christ we are flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones oh there's no way out of it we're going to rhyme amen that's all you go to rise that's all easter means more than just a tradition it is also now our bodies are quickened with him and we're sitting in heavenly places and this body may rot in the sea it may rot in the ground they may not be a spoonful of ashes so she's coming forth before the spirit raised up my lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body squeaking your mortal body and we are his beneficiaries of his resurrection his policy of eternal life that i've talked too much about no wonder you said spirit nonsense you know for paul said therefore is your sin brave where is your victory i'm full of quickening power thanks be to god who gives us a victory to your lord jesus christ yes sir quickening power oh my he is alive forevermore the same yesterday the day and forever hebrews 13 8 notice messiah the anointed one so is his bride the messiah the anointed one notice death does not stop god's quickening power that can't stop it when you've got it it's eternal david ain't nothing to stop it you can't harness it you can't can't do nothing to it do you leave your life out that silly stuff it's just good as it was notice moses is full of that quickening power buzzy he's the prophet who the word came to he was part of the word he's the word of that day is that right and after he was dead 800 years on my transfiguration there he still but they're lying is that right they're quickly powered death don't ever take it away no no i'll raise it up again the angels come buried him down in the valley he had been rotten and gone his bones was gone and everything else but the quickness power was still there they quickened him and brought him up and they're able to stand up no she says that right brother branham after 800 years old month if you'd read matthew i've got a scripture matthew 27 51 you can write part down when all those back there that believed that he would come the bible said here after he come they were sleeping in the ground quickening powers up on and they were part of him than satan they were part of him because they believed on him potentially they had that life through the sacrifice of a sheep of propitiation which could never bring spirit of sheep back up on the man how about now with the spirit of the man got himself up on this earth how much more quickly power do we have but through the propitiation our sin was offered a lamb and type what we have is not the type that's the antitype what are we scared about and those fellows who only had a tight party to his resurrection and went down into the grave with it and job back there under his great stream ah everything tucked away from him the devil said let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face and then he broke through he said don't you think his lies and he said he all but take his life and his wife even turned against him set her breath and become strange to him in other words you should have nothing to do with it she doesn't seem to love him anymore just pushed him away job you're miserable watching his cursed god and i said you talk like a spiritual oh he held right to what he had now he's a prophet he said i am not a sinner i have offered the provided sacrifice amen he knew where he was standing he was on the word no matter what the other says is right there at the word then that great tremendous hour says you speak like a preacher it says the lord gave the lord taken away while blessed be the name of the lord said i come in this world without anything i'll come here and drink it go out the same way blessed be the name of the lord that night broke out and falls as kids stated poverty stricken and us friends all turned against these church members everything else scraping himself was a and what a miserable wretched still he helped in that word he was an eagle oh my you can't keep the film over his eyes all the time no no all it was standing on that word what happened the sky shield back the thunder is beginning to roar the lightning began to flash and job looked up at salvation said i know my regime were living in the last days he'll stand up on this earth and go after the skin worms has destroyed this body bones and all that quickness will be there i'll see god for myself whom i shall see for myself my eyes shall behold and not another is that right go after my reigns be consumed within me though answer the skin worms that's in my body now will destroy it you know skin worms don't come to you that worms already in you your own skin once you realize that put you in a coffin and put it air tight the bugs are eating up just the same because they're in you you are just a bunch of bugs to begin with on the inside though the skin worm my skin worms destroys me my flesh yet in my flesh i'll see god and on that resurrection morning all right hallelujah matthew this great writer of 2751 said after he is resurrected from the dead that the old testament sanctions many of those that slept in the dust the earth comes up and entered into the city and appeared that quickening power still on the bones of elijah when there wasn't no more bones still on job but he won the spoonful of dust that's in his body but the quickest power was still there if this spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling he'll also quicken your mortal body don't just quickly now say oh i wish i lived back you're living a better time now if you all i see you're putting out in scripture all right put it on first thessalonians 4 16 notice how beautiful see in the the saints then that sleep in christ will god bring with you see saints in the grave resting like elijah some like elisha was see some of them be quickened some will be taken some will be in the grave they will go with it the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which arrive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air the quickly power on the living the quicken power on the dead see that same quickness power of god presented in both of these prophets look at their names are almost the same elisha elijah see the pride in the group one of them is mr jesus killing his history almost the same between he and she elijah and look how's representing here now elisha was taken up in the rapture represents the church or elijah and elisha rested until the resurrection see it's just like a bird needs two wings to balance itself the church was represented right there in those two prophets for we which alive and remain to the coming lord shall not hinder them which are seen for the trumpet of god shall sound both wings shall come against you and we will fly away fly away because what in the living are dead that quicken power still is it just gets better but you know if if we keep getting on it getting better and better there will be less and less of us hey amen amen isn't that good i mean it is a one in a million you know remember it gets narrower and narrower but you know there's a a few little things that uh that stood out to me and i know if we had to have fellowship there's a lot of things that that stood out to you but you know how that we surely pamper ourselves huh and didn't you like that you know the skin worms don't come to you the worm is already in you your own skin worms did you ever notice that put you in a coffin and put it airtight the bugs will eat you up just the same because they're in you you are just a bunch of bugs to begin with on the inside what what you know what a reminder you know what i mean we worry about this but if this earthly body be destroyed we have one waiting for us you know this corruptible will put on incorruption and you can't escape the corruption okay it's it's in you you know but what a wonderful uh what a wonderful statement i i just thought that was and i liked a couple of these other little statements we won't keep you along tonight at all but i i thought uh it was pretty wonderful he said in obedience this is paragraph 259 he said in obedience to god if you have never been baptized in the name of jesus christ do it and watch the quickening power pick you up then amen isn't that exactly what the word said he said if you were baptized the name though that you shall you know what i mean that god's eternal you're the only one that dealings with months and days and everything a thousand years is this close to god a thousand years is but a day you know what i mean it's just nothing you know we just say oh i've been going so long and so long you're not out of god's mind and remember you're eternal so god's got eternity to finish it you know we think well if you don't have it done by september you know 28th i'm doomed don't no that that don't even exist in him it's already finished he already saw the finished work amen so we're already sitting in heavenly places that's when when that said we we try to say well we've already sitting there and you look at yourself says i don't feel like i'm sitting in heaven well that's just like he said let there be light the light's there so he's already spoken you of being sitting in heavenly places however he chooses to manifest that that's what makes him sovereign he says oh church of the living god paragraph 261 we can't stand around here on little sugar tits that are nursing around here today we've got to be full and prayed up with kicking power until the quickening of the holy ghost we've got to be caught away someday in that rapture yonder yes sir amen oh my amen so you just you know what you've got you've got a realize you understand we got to realize that something now is being offered to us through the word that was stored up okay so you you can approach the storehouse as being something that's already been spoken and already been done because you got to remember everything that jesus manifested was stored up it was all prophesied and it was all stored up and that's why he said search the scriptures for they are which testify of me i have not let one jot one tittle one prophecy unfulfilled go look at it they speak of me i've done everything that was prophesied of me to do and and if that was true for him then it's got to be true for you the same scriptures that spoke of the groom spoke of the bride you understand so what did jesus do he went into that room at 12 years old and sat down with those scribes because he didn't want their interpretation he was looking where did it say this and where did it say that i i i can see him sitting there but where did it talk about bethlehem right and so they said bethlehem right here a star david out of bethlehem he said where did it speak of nazareth you see where did it speak of egypt where did it speak of this where did it speak of that so if you go to proving his word he says that he went and searched the scriptures and saw everything that the scripture spoke of him and he believed it he identified with it so god did it the same way he received the word as a man and that could let him know that he had that eternal identity with him see satan that's why satan wants a trinity because if he can make him a third a second person then that's something you can never obtain but you were in him eve was in adam but she wasn't separated if god ever did one thing one way he's got to do it again so we were in christ but we weren't separated so now we're being separated out right we're beginning we're coming and what are we doing we're hearing everything that was prophesied of us coming and that's what he said aren't we seeing it today didn't the world have to be this way didn't this have to come through malachi 4 5 i will restore saith the lord so it's all right there for us but it's it's not a workup it is solid and as straightforward and as down to earth and as real as it can be amen i'm telling you you just come to a place one day you're tired of yourself you just don't want to be what you are you want to be him you want to be like him you're you're crying to be him you want to be different you find yourself hungering and thirsting after righteousness it just it's burning in your heart lord i can't go on like this i've been in and out and up and down all my life i'm i'm tired of i'm done with it i i'm surrendering all i'm laying here i'm going to believe it i'm going to follow it i'm going to walk with it this is what i want the question's gone where can we go lord doubt alone hath eternal life you know he talked about the eagle he said he don't her around he don't run after this meal and that meal he's he's after fresh manna and i'll tell you there's more fresh manna i've been reading this for 50 years come on think of it how many in here are over 50. why about five six of you i've been reading this message longer than 95 of you've been born over and over again and let me tell you something it's richer today than it's ever been [Music] i've read the bible but you know something i was promised it would become a new book okay and so many people are reading an old book because it's all been hid but brother in the next little party talks about the quickening power in our day and the seven seals and it's it's good but we'd be here until midnight okay and and and so it it it is just marvelous this is so rich and and so it it when we understand that that so people are scared you know they keep wanting to get people to get the baptism of the holy ghost and he already told you what the evidence of it is that's right it isn't a sensation but this is beyond you know it's like getting a a house you know it's like i grew up in my mom's house you know my mom and dad's house i grew up there and everything i go there i call it my house i go to my room i sleep in my room i can come and go it's my house right but one day i'm going to take possession of that house not me alone you know but my other siblings you know what i mean and then then we can all fuss and fight over everything i i'm glad i'm where i'm at right now you know i think i don't want any of it you know what i mean you guys take the stuff i don't need more stuff i'd like this picture i'd like that picture you know but other than i have at it you know but it it becomes yours and that's what's so beautiful and so if he just he's talking about these stuff you know he and he he talks about he says uh he says there's no strength in that he says now we are trying we are tired of such stuff as that paragraph 263 we are tired as such stuff as that do you understand when you be when you become part of this you can when prophet god says we're tired of stuff like that he said you put yourself right in there i'm tired of all this baby you know and all this pacifying i'm tired of always having to be petted and and pampered and put in the hot house you know i'm tired of having to run to the all turk every service i want to rise up i want to be strong i'm tired of stuff like that well that's the very sentiment that's in our heart because this word has got to come to pass somewhere because everything that was spoken of him has spoken of you he said he says get back your eagles back to the word of god be burly in other words don't be weak and sickly you know there's a timidness a meekness is not not a timidness in the shyness you can be strong and bold as a rock and still be meek that's in other words being meek means you consider the other person's weakness you consider their problems you take into consideration they don't know what you know they don't have what you have you're not a bully you know a lot of people who use the gospel they like to bully people with the gospel they don't want to give anybody credit for having you talking with somebody that wants to talk to you about god they want to talk to you about god because they got a hunger for god you know what i mean don't try to blast everything they got and just tear them down like they don't got nothing you know what they'll know right quick they don't know you ain't got nothing they aren't going to want what you've got anyway so jeff agrees with that he said be burly nothing can hurt your feelings [Music] come on wouldn't don't you want that my goodness i got more feelings than i can stand everything offends me everything in this feeling feeling this just saying something feelings that he feels he leaves yeah be burly know who you are be strong you know be meek don't you know nothing can hurt your feelings therefore you're free oh i'm free you know what's that one we used to say as kids kids sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me you know and then you say a bunch of ugly things about the person because you wanted to what hurt your feelings nothing can hurt your feelings therefore you're free from all the scandals of man whatever anybody says against you that just brings more love and quickening power every time they say things against you it brings more love and more quickening power wouldn't that be different if you just couldn't wait for somebody to criticize you please come say something bad about me i'm going to get more love and more quickening power what a wouldn't that is that a more lovely way to live oh amen brings more love amen and quickening power caught away into the heavenlies an eagle that's done flew above the chickens way up yonder in the heavenly places in christ jesus oh amen and then 265 that same quickening power that we have right now see it will quicken your mortal bodies isn't that right it's the quickening power he talked about philip so he's talking about all these people that this spirit moved on them well it ought to create in us we we don't want a duplicate of their actions you see that's what that that what do they call that cloning or copying i don't want to be caught away some someplace because i don't need an evidence you understand what i'm saying i don't need an evidence i don't have to speak in tongues to know that i have the spirit i don't have to i don't have to be caught someplace up i don't have to be stoned like stephen i don't have to be that but what i want is i want what he wants for me how do you want to quicken me how do you want to use me that that's what i'm hungry for i i don't need to read this book i don't need to go build an ark as we shared at the brothers breakfast then we got the ark we've just got to get in it it'll take us it comes through malachi for amen so that same thing so so many times we look back and we say i'm looking for this well that was for then and and we we know that message won't work today in other words we want a power that works in the circumstances that war we're in i don't know if the people in the days of luther could have handled today but you were created to handle it he put you here in this age because he elected you to be here you were chosen to hear this and manifest this they all wanted to live in this age because they knew that this age was the age that the abstract would be returned back to the opening of the seals he said it's this same thing and then we'll just look over here paragraph 269. talking about elijah and he just gave us the types of the old and the new and the same quickening power that's on the dead so aren't you glad you don't lose that quickening power so even if if you step out of this body you're just in that resting place because they they can't be made perfect without you it takes both sides to fly the bird so to speak i like it he says now that fellow picked up that robe a type of the church again see picking up the robe now he done twice the miracles which is a type of christ and the church see greater work shall you do than these because i go to the father he didn't mean greater as in more powerful but he meant greater in greater number of manifestation you know and he said elijah done four he done eight see how he was a double doubled the power because he asked for it you know when when you listen to life's story and and you listen to the prophet of god in all that he went through and all that he suffered when it all come and done what he asked god was that he could serve him with his whole life all he wanted to do was give his whole life you know i i don't know what i would have done i i thank god that i wasn't put through what he was put through but i know one thing that he'll put nothing upon us that we can't bear i just want to be able to bear what he's put on me with graciousness like job i don't want to sit on a on a dung heap with a bunch of boils with leslie sitting there telling me how stupid i am i mean it you know i i don't want to say i'm a job i don't want to be a job i just want the good part you know but god made him to suffer that and he put it in him he's not going to put upon anything upon you if you bear if your mind is on his mind and you let this mind be in you he will take you through whatever comes upon you you know i i i don't need to be anything else than what i am just let me be a good what i am be the best christian i can be nobody can take your place you know i just think about that great symphony orchestra you know we have people that that play instruments and things and and they're not playing anybody else's part but they're apart you know and and i like the symphony i like to go to the symphony i i just enjoy it so much i don't know a thing about music you know what i mean i don't know why that guy's standing there swirling that stick around but i guess it has some sort of meaning but i enjoy it and what i marvel at is one guy sat down and wrote that music for every single one of those instruments and understood that when it all came together it would sound like this you know and i had two friends that were just you know concert pianist and they were friends with rubenstein the great jewish composer and conductor and on the dumb was a mud fence when it comes to music you know and i mean i remember one day i looked at the piano player and i said f and everybody started laughing because they know i don't know what f is just a letter in the alphabet you know i got a lot of them in school that's why i took that letter i was familiar with it but it all they do is they play their part and they play their part when it's their turn to play the part now could you imagine some guy running around in the orchestra and and all of a sudden somebody's praying he comes running over there you know i mean he's going to play that part and he jumps out of the chair and runs over and grabs the fiddle and starts playing that part and he just runs over here bangs on the runs that push the conductor away starts going like this you know what i mean what would it be it'd be chaos nobody would be hearing the music all they would be seeing is the musicians completely out of order but i love those people then they come to that part and then the flute players are done they all put that thing right there and they sit there like a bunch of stones you know i look around see if anybody's going to scratch their nose or wiggling oh they won't wiggle you know they sit right there you know and then they put that thing up i think man they had sore necks than people you know what i mean and then sometimes they take their hands down this thing's sticking out of them like that i think they practice that you know but you love it because when it's all in its place it's a beautiful music and the whole thing wouldn't sound beautiful unless each person did their part and see we've all got to be in this together it's it's a beautiful time and so let me tell you i i think maybe some of you have been through it where they send your kids home with an instrument to see which one that they want to play they used to do that they made they don't do that no more but you know you come home with a trumpet or a tuba you know and you'd blow that around the house for a while until you finally said i want to play this you know what i mean well god's got something in this word for you don't look at nobody else don't compare yourself get into this message until you see that music was flowing out of you and you play that part to the world you play that part to the people you meet you let the music of the gospel sing out of your heart and and your that next part will come just like me going to that barber i don't know who left those two books you know but here i go to a barber i led of the lord to go to that barber shop to that lady and somebody has been there before me and left her two of brother branham's sermons i didn't know whether to think he beat me to it or what you know what i mean but i thought to me that was like praise god there's something happening here and like i said i don't even know if the brother goes to our church she told me she's a really nice man a lovely man he had long hair and somebody gave him some money to come get a haircut so whoever that fella is god's moving well i don't have a standard set for him you know i don't know he may have had dreadlocks for all i know it don't matter you understand i gotta see the god in everything amen that's like you said wait till the sun comes up and you'll see god everywhere anyway because he asked for it greater things than this that i do shall you do see but he was so full of the quickening power and everything till he done all these double what elijah done more than he did and notice he lived a life on up until about 80 or 90 years old he had got old and died he died and then he talks about the quickening power on them and then paragraph 277 i thought was beautiful he is alive forevermore the same yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 notice messiah the anointed one so is his bride the messiahs the anointed one again this is present tense this message is presence 10. its messenger had delivered his message he done exactly what he was told to do he left the way that god wanted him to leave i don't believe he's dead he may not be in this body but if this is true they're still that quickening power it's still that god is still the same and what that he spoke he spoke of us and so what's transpiring is transpiring present tense and my heart's desire is that i know we're at many different levels in this church many different cultural backgrounds many different teaching backgrounds many different financial circumstances that god is dealing with every heart in every life and with great patience we've got to to wait on one another but remember all the perfection is already in him and he'll depart that perfection in his time and in his season as long as we can love one another stay in the unity of faith understand who our absolute is you understand brother random is not our absolute but were followers of him as he was of christ because that's the way that god chose to bring it so we look past you know in other words you don't refuse the letter because of the mailman but if you refuse the mailman you'll never get the letter if you won't let him come on your property you won't let her come in your life you'll never get the message that he's passing and that's why if you say in this day and age that this is beelzebub when the holy spirit comes and does these things to say one thing against it there's no forgiveness in this life or the life to come because you stop the mailman at the sidewalk and you won't let them deliver the message but i'll tell you if you ever take the message he delivered and read it you're going to be looking for him to come up that walk every day and i know there's more in there and i we're just on the verge i don't know if you noticed this morning many people came up for prayer this morning people i've never seen before and the spirit was moving on them i mean they were broken god was doing something working in their hearts and their life people were claiming things and that's where it starts because they ask when you ask for that quickening power that quickening power will respond you have not because you ask not and you ask that you can't come up and ask and not be believing but when you come up and believe in don't you understand because you were with him at calvary everything that he claimed at calvary you have permission to claim oh i could go preach that over and over and over again it's all struck off you don't have to sit there and say oh well i did this last week i can't pray for this i got to go get this right now praise god gloria he took it and and i wanted to say this in closing because i think it's so important the life that we're living in when america turned down god back in the early 50s and i i i many of you know the quote he said i think was it 57 he said this year 56 he said this year they're going to choose and america turned down god and brother brahm's message even though it went out it wasn't going out to the church world anymore it was only going out to the elect that we receive it and only the elect are going to be a participant in the resurrection that was spoken but because america rejected there's a lot of messed up situation marriage situations children born out of lead all those things and all these but this supersedes all that he said just like that child that got that epilepsy from their grandparents he said this supersedes all that so this can set you free so don't let your past keep you from receiving what god wants to give you amen if you're sincere he knows you're sincere and if he wants to try your faith it pleases him to try your faith thinking not strange at the trying of your faith thinking not strange that the fiery darts the enemy think it's not strange the trine of your faith is more precious than gold because it work is patience and let patience have a perfect work it's a beautiful gospel and and uh you know lately just being personal with you uh you know i i i've been listening uh to the gospel i like listening to alexander scorby and and the way that he preaches it it's just it's made it come alive to me in a different way than when i read it you know just myself and then to me it was scriptural too he that heareth the word so i thought i'd maybe kind of get in on some of that blessing there you know what i mean and uh but this gospel is marvelous amen think these are letters that paul wrote and the things he's saying in there and they're good fall in love with this and it'd really be wonderful so lord richly bless you we'll be here wednesday night and then we're headed to missouri thursday and and let's keep them in prayer that god will bring them a pastor somebody that'll really take care of them and love them and go through with them and i know it's hard because it's hard to please everybody you know and i'm sure everybody has their idea but i'm sure that the lord knows so we just let us pray for them too so lord richly bless you uh this week and if you can be back wednesday night have a prosperous week let your light so shine among men that your good works might glorify your father in heaven don't be afraid to ask people if there's anything you can pray for you know don't be afraid to take on their burdens you are the last glimpse that they're ever going to get of the real church you cannot believe how mad it's getting out there and what apostasy an abomination is going on in the name of the lord but let us press for a higher calling and a higher mark god bless you we'll turn it back to

many situations in my mind that i didn't know if i could overcome even from my parents being married thinking about when they got married to when i was born did the dates line up you know i'd i'd come into church and i'd see the seiler family 20 years ago and i'm like man that family's perfect you know what i mean that's when they all had all the little kids there and i just thought man i'm never going to be able to attain to something like that you know and then you hear the the message tonight and it's like no matter the past no matter the things that come up no matter what your parents did no matter the things that the traits that your dad gave you all those things can be overcome so i just appreciate that and just being being set free you know i can really testify that even as brother david said serving the lord 50 years and seeing these messages you know it's just it's like now we're receiving that abstract several of us were fellowshipping out there and that word is just becoming real so i just i thank the lord for everything that he's doing let's just go to him in prayer heavenly father lord we come to you tonight we can truly appreciate the word that is being spoken lord we know there's things that were preached back in the 40s and 50s and 60s and maybe at that time not everything was being seen but you knew that there would be a time that it would be striking the hearts of your people lord and that it would be anchoring in and we see that loved ones coming in we see prodigals coming in we see people being witnessed to at work and coming off the street and being baptized lord we see things that are are going downtown in the inner cities lord we see brothers being sent out we see this message traveling around the world lord and we're just thankful that we're a part of it lord we know each of us has situations in our lives and in our families lord but you're more than able to overcome all those things lord and sometimes we get caught in our flesh and in our mind and we try to piece things together what help us just to put those things away may we be focused on your word and may we concentrate lord and know what you have for us lord is going to get us to the end lord we even said it yesterday we might not be where we where we first started off lord and what we want to be lord but we know we look back and know that we're not what we used to be we're growing in your word and we thank you for that we commit all things into your hands we ask these things in jesus name amen amen amen i can't wait for the manifestation of the preacher boy am i i looked over jordan and what would i say [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh bye is ah me [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
