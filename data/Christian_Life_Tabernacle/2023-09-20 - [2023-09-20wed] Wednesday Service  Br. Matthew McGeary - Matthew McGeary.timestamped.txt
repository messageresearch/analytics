[21:06] everything was okay all the results the

[21:09] find nothing but Jesus Christ is the

[21:42] harassment and she was terminated
[21:44] yesterday I told her me and my family
[21:47] will keep her in prayer she's filling
[21:49] the losses soon and I just want to put
[21:51] everything in God's hands
[21:53] she's in a sentence she asked me to pray
[21:55] for her because she needs God's help
[21:58] well we know a God that could come upon
[22:00] the scene
[22:02] and this could be for the very thing
[22:03] that may be an introduction of life to
[22:06] her to see God on the move

[23:00] you've called us together Lord and
[23:05] although we're not here on our own

[23:09] it set you you saw this night before
[23:13] there was a world Lord and you
[23:16] you predestinated us to be here you you
[23:19] even predestinated these needs father
[23:21] that lay upon this sacred desk father
[23:24] and that we would hold these needs
[23:27] before you Lord
[23:29] because you're a God that desires to be
[23:32] known father
[23:34] desires to be worshiped with
[23:38] a cause behind it
[23:41] praise that has real meaning behind it
[23:45] father and we're attempting to do that
[23:47] today as we think of all your goodness
[23:49] toward us Lord and so

[24:28] father a witness of Thanksgiving for
[24:31] that Lord a reciprocation that would be
[24:35] pleasing to you
[24:37] and father we ask you Lord that you
[24:39] would be merciful father we we don't
[24:43] want your judgment Lord we we want your
[24:45] mercy Lord and so we ask this for this
[24:48] female lord that feels that she was born
[24:53] false witness against her and lost her
[24:55] job may you undertake for Lord
[24:58] father we offer our
[25:00] our tithes and our offerings father and
[25:03] we commit the rest of the service to you
[25:05] we commit the man of God into your hands
[25:07] may you help him to put himself to one
[25:09] side in me
[25:11] father you come on the scene and
[25:13] deliver the burden that you've placed
[25:15] upon his heart through this vessel that

[28:54] wheat could be the very word that
[28:55] confirms it behind the pulpit where you
[28:57] know it's God speaking to a man and so
[29:00] it's good to be under expectation for
[29:02] God to come on the scene in every
[29:04] service
[29:04] let it not just be tradition let it not
[29:06] be just a way of of just gathering

[29:12] another but God

[36:09] Lord Jesus
[36:12] we're needy tonight

[36:17] receive and the more
[36:20] we know you in the power of your
[36:22] Resurrection
[36:24] Lord there's a paradox we we know
[36:27] there's more of you that we need
[36:29] Lord When We're Young
[36:32] we feel like we can do many things and
[36:36] when we come to know you in the burden
[36:38] of sin is lifted and
[36:40] we just feel like we can soar through
[36:42] the heavenlies and
[36:44] many times with that Lord comes that
[36:48] juvenile attitude and
[36:50] the inability to have certain wisdoms
[36:53] that's needed but as we
[36:55] travel on this side Lord we
[36:58] we learn from you in your word to grow
[37:00] and to be nurtured and to be corrected
[37:03] Lord and
[37:06] to wait upon you Lord for your word says
[37:10] they that wait upon the Lord
[37:14] they shall renew their strength
[37:17] they shall Mount up with wings
[37:20] as an eagle
[37:22] they shall run and not faint Lord
[37:24] we want to wait upon you tonight that
[37:26] you just come Lord
[37:28] do it only you can do and break the
[37:30] bread of life to your people
[37:32] many have come out to the house of God
[37:34] and
[37:35] lord they're hungry they
[37:38] they need you and I need you Lord we all
[37:41] want to make that confession tonight
[37:43] Lord that we're we're here because we we
[37:46] need you Lord but we pray that the
[37:49] moment we took to sing some songs Lord
[37:51] that it was pleasing to you
[37:54] because you're worthy of the praise and
[37:56] the Adoration
[37:58] and now Lord we Just Surrender ourselves
[38:00] to you that you just come now and Jesus
[38:03] Christ's name we pray
[38:05] amen
[38:06] amen just ask you to turn in your Bibles
[38:10] we'll just read out of Romans 8 28.
[38:32] thank you
[38:33] Romans 8.
[38:35] 28 would read like this
[38:39] and we know that all things work
[38:41] together for good
[38:43] to them that love God
[38:45] to them who are called according to
[38:48] his purpose
[38:51] if you want to just turn over in your
[38:52] Bibles to Ephesians
[38:56] chapter 3.
[39:00] verse 9
[39:08] through 11.
[39:17] and to make all men see what is the
[39:19] Fellowship of the mystery
[39:21] which from the beginning of the world
[39:22] hath been hid in God who created All
[39:24] Things by Jesus Christ
[39:26] to the intent that now unto the
[39:28] principle
[39:30] principality and powers and Heavenly
[39:33] places might be known by the church the
[39:36] manifold wisdom of God
[39:38] according to the Eternal purpose which
[39:42] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord
[39:44] amen you you may be seated brother
[39:47] Brandon would make a statement he would
[39:49] say you were made for an eternal purpose
[39:52] because you was the manifestation of an
[39:55] attribute
[39:57] that was in God
[39:59] and just uh just remembering some of the
[40:02] things that we spoke on recently uh just
[40:05] speaking on rapturing faith the faith
[40:07] for this hour that God has placed you
[40:11] here because you are an attribute of
[40:13] himself that he wanted to be here in
[40:18] this present time knowing the condition
[40:20] that the world would be in he he
[40:22] understood the uh the trials he
[40:25] understood uh The Temptations he knew
[40:27] how bad it would be but you know I as I
[40:30] just think upon those lines you wouldn't
[40:32] whenever maybe somebody's putting
[40:34] together an army or something like that
[40:37] they're going to strategically pick
[40:39] certain ones who might have certain
[40:41] strengths and capabilities and and maybe
[40:43] somebody who's a has a good eyesight and
[40:46] he's a good Hunter and he's maybe able
[40:48] to to shoot a rifle really good you
[40:50] might recruit him to be a sniper you
[40:53] might put him in the nest up there so he
[40:55] can be a sniper and he can he can be
[40:58] able to zoom in on the targets and be
[41:00] able to hit the target and other people
[41:02] I might be more qualified as footmen and
[41:05] then you get into the certain ranks of
[41:07] the military uh there's special
[41:09] qualified people that really make it
[41:11] into the air force that can really uh uh
[41:13] uh be able to uh get into those
[41:16] airplanes and when they get up there
[41:18] they call it a G-Force and and as
[41:20] they're pressing in these airplanes and
[41:22] they're they're breaking the sound
[41:23] barriers they come under such a great
[41:26] amount of pressure there's a G-Force
[41:28] that's pressing upon them that not very
[41:30] many people are able to handle the
[41:32] pressure uh because what happens as they
[41:34] start getting up there in 7g force AJ
[41:37] well well a normal civilian would have
[41:39] already been been gone by then
[41:42] you know I it wasn't here too long ago
[41:45] you know when you're when you're younger
[41:46] and your youth you know you can get on
[41:48] the rides and everything and nothing
[41:49] nothing bothers you you can see these
[41:52] little kids they'll just turn in circles
[41:54] and circles and circles and nothing ever
[41:56] bothers them anymore it wasn't too long
[41:58] ago I I went to the kids to Six Flags
[42:01] and and I I mean I tell you I hear about
[42:03] people on rides you know like can you
[42:05] believe that guy got light-headed that
[42:08] guy passed out we got on the Titan we
[42:10] started pulling around the corner and
[42:12] everything started narrowing down
[42:14] all right wait a second
[42:16] you're getting old because because as
[42:19] you get a little bit older maybe you're
[42:21] not cut out for it anymore because it
[42:24] takes a certain conditioning it takes a
[42:26] certain gifted person to be able to to
[42:28] get in that airplane and to break
[42:30] through the sound barrier and to be
[42:32] recruited into the army and you get into
[42:33] the Navy Seals I can't remember how many
[42:36] hundreds or thousands of people try to
[42:38] to make it through the Navy Seals and
[42:40] and you know there's only a few that
[42:42] come out on the other side that actually
[42:44] can graduate and make it maybe can call
[42:47] themself a seal well I want to tell you
[42:49] that God was putting together an army
[42:51] and I could maybe think they're in the
[42:53] ramparts of Glory uh where you were when
[42:56] the sons of God shouted for joy that
[42:58] what God looked down and he looked down
[43:00] into the lady to see a church age he saw
[43:03] how Wicked it was going to be he saw how
[43:05] evil it was going to be and he thought
[43:06] you know what I want to have my very
[43:08] past I want to have the cream of the
[43:10] crop I I I want to put you there I want
[43:13] to put David there I want to put brother
[43:15] Tim there I want to put brother Ben wall
[43:17] sister April uh sister Holly sister
[43:20] Gabrielle I got certain ones that I want
[43:22] to be manifested in that time in that
[43:25] hour because it's the very attribute
[43:27] it's the very expression it's something
[43:29] that I want to manifest to the world
[43:31] that I'm the same yesterday today and
[43:33] forever
[43:36] you you were placed here because you
[43:38] have a special ability
[43:41] to be able to withstand the test
[43:44] to be able to withstand the pressure
[43:47] that when the devil would hurl his
[43:49] doubts at you and and and all of the
[43:52] things that they're starting to to come
[43:54] up with now in this day and age you know
[43:57] they they have this new thing called AI
[44:01] AI
[44:03] does anybody know what AI stands for
[44:08] I think it stands for Rubble
[44:11] if you look into the Bible when when
[44:13] Joshua and them came up to AI
[44:17] there was something something
[44:19] significant in that story because when
[44:21] they came up to AI somebody was hiding
[44:24] something in their heart
[44:26] you know I think AI has a special
[44:28] ability to find out what you're hiding
[44:30] to find out what your behavior is and
[44:33] and how you you navigate through
[44:36] websites and through material and AI has
[44:38] a special ability to find out your
[44:40] weaknesses and the thing that catches
[44:42] your eye and how much time you spend on
[44:44] this internet site how many times you
[44:46] looked at that dress and how many times
[44:48] you looked at that profile don't you
[44:50] realize Somebody's Watching You
[44:52] you know they they they they they got
[44:55] algorithms and things nowadays as you as
[44:57] you swipe they actually time how long
[45:00] you pause on each uh each image and it
[45:03] registers oh he paused on that for two
[45:06] seconds he didn't turn his head
[45:12] you know it's it's it's watching out for
[45:15] your actions and it's making all these
[45:17] documentations of how how you respond
[45:20] and how you act and and and you know
[45:22] it's it's interesting about this AI that
[45:24] they're coming out with you look into
[45:26] the Bible you know there's nothing new
[45:28] Under the Sun right you go looking in
[45:30] your Bible and I believe it was AI that
[45:32] Joshua and the children of Israel were
[45:34] coming up to go into battle is that
[45:36] right and they were going to to conquer
[45:38] Ai and what happened to Joshua
[45:41] they got defeated
[45:43] and Joshua fell on his face and said
[45:45] Lord what is this why why would it be
[45:48] when we would come uh to fight against
[45:50] the enemy that we would turn our backs
[45:52] to the enemy
[45:57] well Joshua was having a pity party
[45:59] but you know what God told him to do
[46:01] Joshua get up
[46:04] get up Joshua
[46:07] there's sin in the camp
[46:09] somebody's taken of the Forbidden thing
[46:12] they're hiding something in their heart
[46:15] and now what we need you to do is we
[46:17] need you to go before the children of
[46:19] Israel
[46:22] and and we need you to have the families
[46:25] come up one by one and we're going to
[46:27] find out who it is that's holding these
[46:29] things in their heart and in their life
[46:31] that is causing the army of God to fail
[46:33] you know the prophet of God said that
[46:36] your attitude
[46:38] your attitude can knock somebody out out
[46:41] of their healing
[46:43] it's what he said
[46:45] so then I think when we come to the
[46:47] house of God when we have interactions
[46:49] with our brothers and sisters I want to
[46:51] tell you your attitude matters
[46:54] your attitude can determine the success
[46:57] of this service
[46:58] now don't let these be idle wears like
[47:01] God speak to you tonight because your
[47:03] attitude can affect
[47:06] the outcome of this service your
[47:08] attitude could be the difference
[47:11] between if somebody is healed or not
[47:13] healed now I'm not blazing that on my
[47:16] words I'm looking into the message of
[47:18] the hour and knowing that a Vindicated
[47:20] Prophet told me Matthew McGarry's son
[47:23] you understand that's your attitude
[47:26] we we got to be tutored we got to be
[47:29] taught look look that's what's tutoring
[47:31] and teaching the Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:33] is the message of the hour
[47:35] and the word and the Holy Spirit is the
[47:37] same thing if you want to know what the
[47:39] Holy Ghost is saying it's good evening
[47:41] friends
[47:43] good evening friends that's what the
[47:44] Holy Ghost is saying to the bride of
[47:47] Christ it's teaching you molding you and
[47:50] shaping you
[47:51] and he said Matthew your attitude can be
[47:54] the difference it can knock somebody out
[47:56] of their healing
[47:58] he would go on to say and and in your
[48:01] unconfessed sins of
[48:05] you believers
[48:08] Oh you mean you Believers he said you're
[48:13] unconfessing of you Believers can cause
[48:15] this church to bitterly fail
[48:22] our unconfessed sins
[48:26] now what we really want is the Lord to
[48:28] do heart surgery
[48:32] because my Bible tells me
[48:34] that we need to be in one mind and one
[48:37] Accord
[48:39] the prophet of God said I long to see
[48:42] the day when sin is called out at the
[48:44] door like ananias and Sapphira
[48:48] if we can start getting into one mind in
[48:51] one Accord but something that broken the
[48:53] unity there at AI
[48:55] somebody had had partaken of the things
[48:58] of the world and they'd hid him in their
[49:00] heart they'd buried it in the midst of
[49:01] their tit
[49:03] and when Aiken is that right is it Aiken
[49:06] when he when he when he came before
[49:07] Joshua when he asked him is it true have
[49:09] you taken of the accursed thing
[49:12] see Aiken was that the re was the one
[49:15] responsible for the lives of other
[49:17] believers
[49:19] think of it now his unconfessed sin
[49:22] caused the church to bitterly fail and
[49:25] here we're going into a battle come on
[49:27] Church we're fighting to go in our
[49:29] rapture we have moms and dads fighting
[49:31] for their prodigal sons and prodigal
[49:33] daughters and we sit back and what are
[49:35] we doing to fight
[49:41] oh there ought to be a shaking in the
[49:43] church
[49:44] there ought to be something in the
[49:46] believer that's causing us to move into
[49:49] an act into into action
[49:52] as our pastor was preaching on
[49:54] investments we want to be investing in
[49:56] the right things I I want to invest in a
[49:59] word that will produce rapturing faith
[50:03] I want to invest into something that's
[50:05] drawing me closer to the Lord
[50:08] but we find the struggle of this age as
[50:12] now we have things like Ai and and this
[50:15] artificial intelligence don't you
[50:16] realize that all of these things are
[50:18] targeted against the Bride of Jesus
[50:20] Christ
[50:21] well it may be in its Inception uh maybe
[50:25] there's some uh I don't even want to
[50:28] call it innocency to it I just can only
[50:30] say what the prophet said he said
[50:31] Science Education religion all of these
[50:35] things it's of the devil
[50:37] so anytime we see some great advancement
[50:40] anytime we see some new WoW technology
[50:43] don't if I'll think for one second that
[50:46] Satan is not trying to get his hands on
[50:48] these things to try to use it against
[50:50] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[50:52] you know you get into study about this
[50:54] this AI technology and it manipulates
[50:56] statements and material and it can come
[50:59] up with its own explanation on Experts
[51:02] uh subjects because it's able to gather
[51:05] from here and it's able to gather from
[51:07] all over these places and now they're
[51:09] using AI to produce material and to
[51:12] manipulate things you know even in China
[51:14] that that the the regime over there oh I
[51:18] can't remember what the guy's name is
[51:20] we'll call them Dr Oz
[51:22] I don't know what is he
[51:25] cheese in Jew
[51:28] he is trying to change the Bible
[51:32] did you know that
[51:34] they actually looked in there and they
[51:36] found out that the story of the woman
[51:38] that was caught in adultery and that was
[51:40] thrown at the feet of Jesus they said it
[51:44] actually undermined the authority of the
[51:46] state
[51:47] so we got to change that story so they
[51:50] rewrote it and introduced it to some
[51:53] people on a college campus that where
[51:54] Jesus actually stoned her for her sin
[51:57] because they didn't want something in
[52:00] the literature that would give somebody
[52:02] an ability to to come out from
[52:04] underneath the law
[52:06] well if they're already trying to do
[52:08] that over in China and they're that this
[52:10] Qi guy is trying to distort the Bible
[52:13] and I thought it was really profound as
[52:15] as our our brother uh championed if you
[52:18] will how great it was to be able to
[52:21] finally get a Bible uh translated as
[52:24] close to the original as possible and
[52:26] get it into the hands of the for the
[52:28] people in China and right after this
[52:30] great work was done it would just seem
[52:32] that the government regime is now
[52:34] putting something else in action why
[52:36] because he wants to take the word out of
[52:38] the hands of the people
[52:40] and no doubt they're going to try to use
[52:42] technology to start to try to take the
[52:45] message of the hour out of the hands of
[52:46] the people
[52:48] start to try to change the uh the text
[52:51] and try to manipulate it and try to form
[52:53] their own thoughts and their own adult
[52:55] look they were splicing tapes back there
[52:57] in the 40s and 50s
[53:00] they were taking real to reels and
[53:03] cutting them and cutting out portions
[53:04] and trying to make the prophet say
[53:06] things he didn't say you don't think
[53:08] they're going to try to do it today you
[53:09] don't think there's websites and AI
[53:11] technology and all of these things that
[53:13] they're trying to get together what is
[53:15] it all trying to do it's trying to come
[53:17] against the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[53:19] take the word of God from you to try to
[53:21] make you a dead formal cold church but
[53:23] there ought to be something in your
[53:24] heart that's fighting for the word of
[53:26] God that wants to make an investment
[53:28] into something that matters I want to
[53:31] make an investment in the message of the
[53:32] hour I want to make an investment in the
[53:34] third pool I want to make an investment
[53:36] in understanding what the voice is
[53:38] saying to the church he that hath an ear
[53:40] let him hear what the spirit say it to
[53:42] the church
[53:47] our pastor spoke about a faith that
[53:49] changes things
[53:53] faith that changes I want a faith that
[53:56] changes things
[53:59] anybody here need a change
[54:04] I need a change
[54:07] oh I need a change
[54:10] I want to change I'm longing for a
[54:12] change you might not know you need a
[54:13] change you need to change
[54:15] we all need a change and I want to tell
[54:18] you you're living in the hour that
[54:21] change has been promised for the Bride
[54:23] of Jesus Christ you might be walking in
[54:25] a dead dying generation of the world
[54:27] with sin everywhere but you're living
[54:30] under a promise that in a moment in a
[54:32] twinkling of an eye you're going to be
[54:34] changed I say there ought to be
[54:36] something in the bride of Christ tonight
[54:38] that is longering that's hungering and
[54:40] thirsting for a change
[54:43] something to change your body
[54:48] something to change your attitude
[54:52] something to change
[54:55] what's driving you
[54:57] what's motivating you
[55:01] yeah they make the statement in the
[55:02] world what gets you up
[55:05] in the morning
[55:08] when you wake up what do you look
[55:10] forward to
[55:14] is it your video game
[55:16] is it check in your profile

[55:32] honey look I'm up to 11 subscribers if I
[55:36] just get
[55:38] 893
[55:40] 892 more subscribers I can actually make
[55:43] some money to an expense
[55:47] at what cost
[55:50] oh Investments
[55:52] that's not going to produce a faith that
[55:54] changes things
[55:57] but I want a faith that changes things
[56:00] maybe if you'll turn into your Bibles
[56:02] we'll just see if we can allow the Lord
[56:05] to have his way a little bit this
[56:07] evening
[56:09] into Deuteronomy
[56:15] we'll just read uh Deuteronomy chapter
[56:18] 11.
[56:20] verse 26
[56:32] . I like this uh just speaking about uh
[56:36] making an investment
[56:39] and a faith that changes things
[56:43] look at this right here in Deuteronomy
[56:45] 11 26.
[56:56] I was going to promise I'll be short
[56:57] tonight
[56:59] but Promises of man are made to be
[57:02] broken
[57:03] so I'm not going to promise anything but
[57:06] maybe we'll just get out of here
[57:09] and just a little bit of time but just
[57:11] reading now here in Deuteronomy chapter
[57:13] 11.
[57:16] if I can get there
[57:20] I know it's in my Bible
[57:25] Deuteronomy 11 verse 26.
[57:29] behold I set before you this day a
[57:31] blessing and a curse
[57:35] now I want to just tell you that every
[57:37] day there's something set before you
[57:39] is a blessing and a curse
[57:42] a blessing if you obey the Commandment
[57:45] of the Lord your God which I command
[57:47] unto you and the curse if you will not
[57:49] obey the Commandment of the Lord your
[57:51] God but turn aside from the way which I
[57:54] have commanded you
[57:56] this day to go after other gods which
[57:59] you have not known
[58:01] and it shall come to pass when the Lord
[58:03] thy God hath brought thee unto the land
[58:05] whether thou ghost to possess it that
[58:07] thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount
[58:09] Israel and the curse upon Mount evil and
[58:13] they are on the other side of Jordan by
[58:15] the way where the sun goeth down in the
[58:16] land of the Canaanites which dwell in
[58:19] the
[58:22] what is this campaign over against
[58:23] gilgal beside the plains of Mora for you
[58:26] shall pass over Jordan to go into
[58:28] possess the land which the Lord God
[58:30] giveth you and ye shall possess it and
[58:32] dwell therein and ye shall observe to do
[58:34] all the statutes and judgments with I
[58:36] set before you this day he says behold I
[58:38] sat before you a blessing and a curse
[58:41] well if you don't obey the word of the
[58:43] Lord
[58:44] there's a law of reaping and sowing
[58:48] right
[58:49] this message is filled with blessings
[58:53] we even read that that that that quote
[58:56] uh last service about we're in the
[58:58] judgment
[58:59] but there's been Mercy that's been
[59:01] extended unto the Bride of Jesus Christ
[59:03] by the revelation of Malachi 4 5 that
[59:06] the Capstone has come cry in Grace Grace
[59:09] it's the grace of God to you it's the
[59:11] love of God to you but when you wake up
[59:14] I say there's something set before you
[59:16] uh this day a blessing and a curse
[59:18] there's a blessing if you heed the words
[59:20] of the Lord but if you reject the word
[59:22] of the Lord and you turn into the things
[59:24] of the world there's a curse in that
[59:28] but as we read in our opening text
[59:31] praise God that it says that all things
[59:33] work together for good
[59:38] you know I love the the prophet's life
[59:40] and how how transparent he was you know
[59:43] he got out there I believe in South
[59:44] Africa and the angel of the Lord told
[59:46] him to go to Durban South Africa but
[59:48] these these businessmen in these these
[59:51] these leaders they these religious
[59:53] leaders they had a whole campaign drawn
[59:55] up
[59:57] and they said oh brother Brandon we need
[59:59] you to go this way and the angel of the
[1:00:00] Lord was telling them you need to go to
[1:00:02] Durbin
[1:00:04] but he just felt such a pressure from
[1:00:06] these from these businessmen and you
[1:00:08] know they had the finances and they had
[1:00:10] the the vehicles to take him to where he
[1:00:12] could go and he and he just kind of felt
[1:00:14] pressured he felt handcuffed he felt
[1:00:16] like he he couldn't he couldn't do much
[1:00:18] about it and all of a sudden along that
[1:00:21] way what was he doing the prophet of God
[1:00:23] was walking in the permissive will
[1:00:29] I believe one of the meetings they went
[1:00:31] and it was all set up with these tits
[1:00:32] and this Monsoon came and just totally
[1:00:34] blew the place apart and brother band
[1:00:37] was like I told y'all
[1:00:39] I told you I got to get into Durbin and
[1:00:42] he was getting all of the all these
[1:00:44] problems were happening and everything
[1:00:46] uh what what was just it wasn't right
[1:00:49] and brother Branham knew it he was
[1:00:50] feeling it and then the angel of the
[1:00:52] Lord came and he was talking to him and
[1:00:53] he said go ahead go on just continue on
[1:00:56] but it's the permissive will
[1:00:59] but when he finally got to where he was
[1:01:02] supposed to be that's where the blessing
[1:01:03] was
[1:01:04] and you know it was in that trip and
[1:01:06] that permissive will where brother
[1:01:08] Brandon picked up those amoebas in his
[1:01:09] stomach and he battled that for years
[1:01:14] he battled that for years
[1:01:16] now have we come to the place where
[1:01:20] where we're not subject to the word
[1:01:23] to where we can just walk contrary to
[1:01:27] the will of God we can walk contrary to
[1:01:30] the message of the hour we can come when
[1:01:32] we feel like it when the church doors
[1:01:34] are open well we don't have to come on
[1:01:36] Sunday night because I already I already
[1:01:38] did my duty uh there's other things that
[1:01:41] I want to do there's other Investments
[1:01:43] that I want to make look if the prophet
[1:01:45] of God who gave his whole life for this
[1:01:48] word and for this message slept on the
[1:01:50] pulpit on the platform night after night
[1:01:53] after night practically traveling around
[1:01:55] the world seven times lost his wife and
[1:01:58] his his baby girl and his family and
[1:02:00] everybody left him and he stood alone
[1:02:03] he stood alone
[1:02:09] now with everybody that you knew walked
[1:02:11] away from the message of the hour
[1:02:15] could you stand alone
[1:02:20] well
[1:02:21] I know you could
[1:02:24] that's why God put you here
[1:02:28] he said I got one
[1:02:31] I like the story in the Old Testament
[1:02:35] about I believe I believe Goliath when
[1:02:37] he comes out and makes this boast he
[1:02:38] says give me a man
[1:02:40] I can see God laughing up in the rare
[1:02:41] parts of Glory I got one
[1:02:43] he's on his way down there just just
[1:02:45] hold on Goliath give me a man I got one
[1:02:49] for you just just hold on
[1:02:51] here he comes in but uh he's carrying a
[1:02:53] a bucket of cheese
[1:02:57] little Ruddy guy coming down didn't even
[1:02:59] look like a man just look like a boy but
[1:03:02] David was an attribute of God
[1:03:04] David had been anointed David had been
[1:03:07] placed there for the purpose to be
[1:03:09] anointed king over Israel and there was
[1:03:11] no devil in hell that was going to stop
[1:03:13] the purpose of God and you've been put
[1:03:16] here by an eternal purpose to manifest
[1:03:18] the message of the hour
[1:03:22] so then I asked you what can stop you
[1:03:25] if your friends turn on you if you're
[1:03:27] your neighbor if your family if the
[1:03:29] church if everything walked away there's
[1:03:31] something in you that even if you're
[1:03:33] walking in the wrong thing
[1:03:36] if you can just repent in your eyes say
[1:03:38] Lord I know I've messed up I know I've
[1:03:41] made a mistake I know I'm not where I'm
[1:03:43] supposed to be Lord but you said you
[1:03:46] work all things out for good Lord here I
[1:03:49] am father I'm repenting of my sins
[1:03:51] forgive me for my Wicked Ways Lord
[1:03:53] search My Heart Lord search me try me oh
[1:03:57] God and I know Lord if you'll come down
[1:03:59] tonight father you can correct my heart
[1:04:02] you can correct my life you can get me
[1:04:04] back on track oh God because you work
[1:04:07] all things out together for my good
[1:04:14] and I believe the story goes when
[1:04:16] brother Branham showed up there in
[1:04:17] Durban there was such a mighty move that
[1:04:19] they were packing truck fulls of
[1:04:21] stretchers and crutches
[1:04:25] because God knows how to take what's
[1:04:27] wrong
[1:04:29] and make it right
[1:04:33] and maybe if I could say it in the most
[1:04:37] simple way
[1:04:40] there's a lot of things in our lives
[1:04:42] that's wrong
[1:04:47] and we need to come up higher
[1:04:51] it's time to set our wings
[1:04:54] it's time to really if we're going to
[1:04:57] enter into this rapturing faith
[1:05:00] the faith for this hour
[1:05:02] if we're really going to make an
[1:05:04] investment into what counts and what
[1:05:07] matters
[1:05:09] I sat before you this day a blessing and
[1:05:11] a curse
[1:05:12] which one are you going to choose
[1:05:15] see when you when you when you when you
[1:05:18] grow and you
[1:05:19] uh mature and you get older really a lot
[1:05:23] of what it comes down to is discipline
[1:05:27] you know if you're if you're the owner
[1:05:29] of a company and you're hiring somebody
[1:05:31] you know nowadays a college degree
[1:05:34] really just says that you can pay
[1:05:37] attention and show up somewhere
[1:05:40] okay this guy can pay attention and
[1:05:42] eagerly show up on time for x amount of
[1:05:45] days I can use something because people
[1:05:47] get college degrees all the time now and
[1:05:49] they they practice in fields they didn't
[1:05:51] even study
[1:05:53] they're looking to get a job and they
[1:05:55] put out their application and it's like
[1:05:57] well why are you working over there well
[1:05:58] there was nothing in the field but that
[1:06:00] why did they hire you because people
[1:06:01] just want somebody that can be
[1:06:02] disciplined that could show up to work
[1:06:03] on time that can do what they're told
[1:06:06] and I say that you know this bride needs
[1:06:09] to be mature we need to be disciplined
[1:06:12] we need to study to show ourselves
[1:06:15] approved and have a pattern of good
[1:06:16] works because we always wonder why we're
[1:06:18] slipping back into the areas of our life
[1:06:21] and we wonder why we're going through
[1:06:22] the cycles because we're not being
[1:06:23] disciplined
[1:06:27] we give in to so many things and that's
[1:06:29] one thing about the age that that makes
[1:06:31] so many things
[1:06:33] available to us but I'm just so thankful
[1:06:36] that that God knows how to take the
[1:06:38] wrong and make it right if you just turn
[1:06:40] over to your Bibles uh maybe we'll just
[1:06:43] see if we can Fellowship around this for
[1:06:44] a moment
[1:06:46] see if the Lord would be pleased with
[1:06:47] this
[1:06:53] and maybe somebody uh here this evening
[1:06:57] is
[1:06:58] uh it needs to make a a decision or
[1:07:01] they've
[1:07:02] they've made some decisions and they're
[1:07:04] suffering the consequences of it
[1:07:06] uh just let's focus on that opening text
[1:07:09] how God will work everything out for
[1:07:10] good this is a wonderful story in the
[1:07:13] Bible if you just flip over a couple
[1:07:15] more chapters in the Deuteronomy chapter
[1:07:16] 23 this is just a thought that was on my
[1:07:19] heart a while back and uh
[1:07:23] it's picking up in the story of Balaam
[1:07:30] and I just want to read verse 5 because
[1:07:32] he's he's he's speaking now how how how
[1:07:35] how
[1:07:37] the children of Israel are crossing
[1:07:38] through Moab and and Baal he he he's
[1:07:41] just afraid of these people uh gobbling
[1:07:44] up all of his his uh uh the grasses of
[1:07:47] the land and everything he's heard the
[1:07:49] fame of them going forth and he doesn't
[1:07:51] want nothing to do with them so he's
[1:07:52] actually went and gotten uh Balaam and
[1:07:54] he's asked Balaam look Balaam I want you
[1:07:56] to curse these people I I want you to
[1:07:58] curse him and so now uh Balaam being
[1:08:01] being a prophet a false prophet for that
[1:08:03] matter but he had the order he had the
[1:08:05] approach he knew how to approach God he
[1:08:07] went before God and the scripture would
[1:08:09] say this and in that shed it would say
[1:08:10] in Deuteronomy chapter 23 verse 5 see
[1:08:13] nevertheless the Lord thy God would not
[1:08:15] hearken an abalone but the Lord thy God
[1:08:18] turn the curse into a blessing unto thee
[1:08:22] because the Lord thy God loved thee
[1:08:26] or if that ain't something that you can
[1:08:28] anchor your heart on in this hour that
[1:08:31] you you've been born under a curse
[1:08:34] you've been born in the most cursed age
[1:08:36] the world has ever known it's gone into
[1:08:39] a blackout a complete apostasy
[1:08:42] Isaiah 61 gross Darkness upon the land
[1:08:45] and gross Darkness upon the people
[1:08:50] and the devil wants to curse you
[1:08:53] he wants to hold you captive he wants to
[1:08:55] hold you in bondage he wants to take
[1:08:58] your mistakes and your failures and
[1:09:00] point to your past and and maybe times
[1:09:02] you were taken advantage of his scars
[1:09:04] and things that you're carrying in their
[1:09:06] life that you feel you can never Shake
[1:09:08] loose of
[1:09:11] where the devil wanted to curse you God
[1:09:14] takes the curse
[1:09:16] and he makes it into a blessing
[1:09:19] why does he do that
[1:09:23] what's the rest of that scripture say
[1:09:26] because
[1:09:28] he loves you
[1:09:31] love does that
[1:09:33] love covers a multitude of sin
[1:09:38] now what about us
[1:09:40] the only thing that can enter there is
[1:09:42] perfect love
[1:09:44] well if love covers a multitude of sins
[1:09:46] some of us need to cover the sins of our
[1:09:48] brothers and sisters
[1:09:50] we're quick to talk about it we're quick
[1:09:53] to expose it to one another if somebody
[1:09:55] doesn't respond right if somebody
[1:09:57] doesn't have the right reaction did you
[1:10:00] hear what so-and-so said do you think
[1:10:02] they were trying to do this they're
[1:10:03] always trying to put their input on this
[1:10:06] but love should cover a multitude of sin
[1:10:09] if you feel like your brother's in a
[1:10:11] fault or you feel like they didn't
[1:10:13] handle something right we should go and
[1:10:15] onto our knees into prayer we should be
[1:10:17] praying about it we should be seeking
[1:10:19] the Lord we can say oh he might not have
[1:10:20] meant that and maybe you can be a part
[1:10:22] of the solution God can put a word on
[1:10:24] your heart and maybe in Fellowship you
[1:10:26] can know I might have would have handled
[1:10:28] that a little differently because I
[1:10:29] think your brother got offended when you
[1:10:30] said that
[1:10:34] that's what love does
[1:10:37] love covers a multitude of sin
[1:10:42] God knows how to take the curse and turn
[1:10:44] it into a blessing
[1:10:46] we could just look down through story
[1:10:48] after story in the Bible and see how
[1:10:51] there was ones of our brothers or
[1:10:53] sisters who came into a situation of
[1:10:56] cursing and God was able to take that
[1:10:58] curse and turn it into a blessing one of
[1:11:01] my favorite stories in the Bible is
[1:11:03] Joseph how Joseph was hated of his
[1:11:06] brother and he was sold into slavery
[1:11:09] cursed
[1:11:11] but wherever Joseph went he was blessed
[1:11:13] because God can take the curse and make
[1:11:16] it a blessing oh don't you realize
[1:11:19] that's why you're sitting here tonight
[1:11:23] why you
[1:11:26] why are you sitting here tonight
[1:11:28] because somebody loved you
[1:11:34] because somebody loved you is why you're
[1:11:37] sitting here tonight
[1:11:38] you'd be out there in the drug house
[1:11:40] you'd be out there in the jail cell
[1:11:43] you'd be out there in prison you'd be
[1:11:45] laying up in the morgue you'd be out
[1:11:47] there in the graveyard you'd be so lost
[1:11:49] down in denominationals you would be
[1:11:51] some Catholic or some Baptist so far
[1:11:54] away from God you didn't know nothing
[1:11:55] about it but oh God rich and mercy
[1:11:58] somebody that loved you pulled you out
[1:12:00] of the mucking admire he gave you an ear
[1:12:03] to hear that great Eagle stream and call
[1:12:06] you out of the Barnyard how can I get
[1:12:09] there how can I make it I just saw jump
[1:12:12] son just Slap Your Wings just give it a
[1:12:14] try
[1:12:15] what did that somebody that loved you
[1:12:20] somebody that could take a life
[1:12:23] with no hope
[1:12:27] with no chance
[1:12:31] but then God would smile upon you with
[1:12:33] love and compassion and say you're
[1:12:35] you're my attribute
[1:12:38] have an eternal purpose I have a plan
[1:12:40] for your life I I have something that I
[1:12:42] want to do with you
[1:12:45] I'm going to change your life from a
[1:12:48] curse and turn it into a blessing
[1:12:51] I love that story of Joseph he gets all
[1:12:54] the way down to the end and you know he
[1:12:56] puts his his brothers rightfully so
[1:12:58] gives him a little bit of a hard time
[1:13:00] wants to find out if his his daddy is
[1:13:03] still alive and they come by and he
[1:13:05] hides a cup on them and now they got to
[1:13:06] bring their little his little brother
[1:13:08] and now he finally sees his little
[1:13:09] Brethren and now you know okay man eat
[1:13:12] you your little brother stole a cup now
[1:13:14] I'm going to keep your little brother
[1:13:15] like oh my goodness now my father's
[1:13:17] really going to die if you keep the
[1:13:19] youngest one you'd understand oh oh well
[1:13:21] what is it to you oh you don't
[1:13:22] understand you know this is from the
[1:13:25] mother with we had another brother that
[1:13:27] that he's been gone oh yeah is it so
[1:13:32] is that really what happened is that the
[1:13:34] truth
[1:13:35] is that really why you're doing the
[1:13:37] things that you're doing is that really
[1:13:39] why you're living the way that you're
[1:13:41] living not really the way that I'm
[1:13:43] saying all these things is because we
[1:13:44] made a really bad decision a lot of
[1:13:46] years ago and we've been suffering for
[1:13:49] it ever since and what we really need to
[1:13:51] do is repent
[1:13:54] oh the grace of God was there to tell
[1:13:56] them
[1:13:58] I am Joseph
[1:14:01] don't be afraid
[1:14:03] what you meant for evil
[1:14:07] God has used it to preserve and save
[1:14:10] much life oh that's the God we serve the
[1:14:13] god that can take our hopeless situation
[1:14:15] that can take a terrible decision that
[1:14:18] you made years ago and he can come to
[1:14:21] you in sweetness and whisper in your ear
[1:14:22] a love secret say don't worry my child
[1:14:25] I'm going to take the curse and I'm
[1:14:27] going to make it a blessing
[1:14:33] oh we want to move into rapturing faith
[1:14:36] we want to move into a faith that
[1:14:38] changes things we want to move into a
[1:14:40] position where we'll ask him and we'll
[1:14:43] know what we'll we'll have what we ask
[1:14:45] for
[1:14:49] you know Esther's situation didn't
[1:14:52] really seem too good her being pulled
[1:14:53] away from the only family she knew
[1:14:57] but Mordecai spoke those words to her
[1:14:59] and said maybe you've come to the
[1:15:01] kingdom for such a time as this
[1:15:04] and Esther had to make a decision
[1:15:08] either I'm here for a reason or I'm not
[1:15:12] we need to make a decision Church we're
[1:15:15] either here for a reason or we're not
[1:15:18] what reason are you here for
[1:15:22] this might shock you you're not here to
[1:15:25] get an education
[1:15:31] that might be your occupation
[1:15:34] but that's not why you're here
[1:15:38] did I say education occupation some
[1:15:40] people become career
[1:15:42] students
[1:15:47] Forever Learning
[1:15:50] but you get an education to get an
[1:15:51] occupation but that's not why you're
[1:15:53] here
[1:15:58] we need to make a decision why we're
[1:16:00] here you know when you wake up and you
[1:16:02] have a job you got a job to do
[1:16:04] and typically you have instructions
[1:16:08] I used to work at McDonald's
[1:16:11] shocking
[1:16:13] it's a good job
[1:16:15] it'll teach you things
[1:16:17] not that hard
[1:16:20] somehow the same
[1:16:22] work has become harder for the newer
[1:16:24] Generations
[1:16:26] I lived right here about 700 feet in
[1:16:28] that direction
[1:16:30] 15 year old I walked down the hill I
[1:16:32] went to McDonald's I had on my uniform I
[1:16:34] went in there I took orders at the
[1:16:36] register I went out I cleaned the
[1:16:37] cleaned the lobby I swept the floor I
[1:16:40] took out the trash and I learned how to
[1:16:41] tie a trash bag you put a little knot on
[1:16:43] there put it around there really holds
[1:16:44] it on there when everybody throws in all
[1:16:46] their full drinks and everything it
[1:16:47] won't come off the sides
[1:16:49] I had a job to do though
[1:16:51] that's what I was hired for was to go
[1:16:54] there and take orders wipe down the
[1:16:56] tables clean the floor clean the
[1:16:58] bathroom
[1:17:00] I didn't walk down the hill wondering
[1:17:02] well what am I going to do today
[1:17:05] I'm going to show up to work and I'm
[1:17:07] going to walk in and hey boss so what do
[1:17:09] you want me to do today
[1:17:11] the same thing you've been doing every
[1:17:13] day maybe that's the problem for
[1:17:15] Christians reporting to duty you don't
[1:17:17] know what to do because you haven't been
[1:17:19] doing anything
[1:17:25] testify do something get on fire for God
[1:17:29] if you don't know what to do here's an
[1:17:30] altar find out what it is
[1:17:33] and I tell you when when you get when
[1:17:36] you take the gospel
[1:17:38] when you get borned again oh and you get
[1:17:41] filled with the Holy Ghost now you got
[1:17:42] marching orders
[1:17:44] it ain't a question you don't show up to
[1:17:46] the job you don't show up into the into
[1:17:49] the church and say well I wonder what I
[1:17:50] need to do today no there's something
[1:17:52] inside of you on that day when they were
[1:17:55] gathered in the upper room in the pillar
[1:17:57] of fire dropped down oh they came
[1:17:59] spilling out of there and they came out
[1:18:02] into the streets they were speaking in
[1:18:03] tongues they looked like a bunch of wild
[1:18:05] men and everybody looked at them and
[1:18:07] presumed what are these men are they
[1:18:09] drunk and Peter stood there says no
[1:18:11] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[1:18:13] but this is that which was prophesied by
[1:18:16] the prophet Joel I'll pour out my spirit
[1:18:18] Hallelujah they didn't need some
[1:18:21] somebody to tell them what to do they
[1:18:23] had the inside teacher what we need in
[1:18:26] the Church of God is the inside teacher
[1:18:29] we need to get born again and that'll
[1:18:31] tell you how to go to work
[1:18:34] oh
[1:18:37] if we get so far down the road with with
[1:18:41] Theology and leave out Calvary
[1:18:43] something's wrong we need births
[1:18:48] we we need people born again we need
[1:18:51] people to weep their way to Calvary and
[1:18:54] come in contact with a real God and say
[1:18:57] Lord I really don't have what I thought
[1:18:59] I had I'm listening to tapes I'm going
[1:19:02] to church I'm going to work but I really
[1:19:04] don't see that change that says in your
[1:19:06] word that you become a new creature old
[1:19:08] things pass away and All Things become
[1:19:11] new I say there ought to be a hunger
[1:19:12] there ought to be a desire in the heart
[1:19:15] of God's people say Lord change me
[1:19:18] tonight make me different make me new
[1:19:21] give me marching orders that I can stand
[1:19:24] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:19:26] and say this is that what was prophesied
[1:19:31] a real change
[1:19:37] because when you wake up you know what
[1:19:38] you're here for
[1:19:41] eternal life is living for others
[1:19:47] it's not to condemn you
[1:19:51] sometimes the reason we don't witness
[1:19:53] and do the things that we should because
[1:19:55] we need something more
[1:20:00] that's okay
[1:20:04] it's okay to need more
[1:20:08] is that all right Church
[1:20:11] is it okay to want the Holy Ghost
[1:20:16] is it okay not to have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:17] and want it
[1:20:20] if this church ever becomes so stuffed
[1:20:22] shirt
[1:20:25] where somebody feels out of place
[1:20:27] because they ain't got the the badge
[1:20:29] that I'm in the club
[1:20:34] I would rather somebody be honest and
[1:20:36] sincere
[1:20:38] and say I see the life of the Prophet I
[1:20:41] see the life of Our Lord I see what's on
[1:20:43] the tapes and I don't have it God bless
[1:20:46] you
[1:20:49] God can do something with that
[1:20:52] but if all we can do is quote it and and
[1:20:54] quote the Bible and quote it and go
[1:20:56] about our careers and never live it
[1:20:59] that's not what this is about
[1:21:04] this is about being changed
[1:21:08] that's what the prophet was what was was
[1:21:11] trying to bring to the church
[1:21:13] he said we can hardly have enough faith
[1:21:16] for Divine Healing
[1:21:18] but we got to have the faith for this
[1:21:20] hour to be changed
[1:21:22] to be caught away
[1:21:25] that's going to come with a a deep
[1:21:28] Earnest sincerity
[1:21:31] a deep crave and a deep hunger
[1:21:34] for revelation
[1:21:36] and for more of God but we find out that
[1:21:39] this cursed world that's pressing in
[1:21:41] around us and all of the pressure
[1:21:43] everything is designed to try to keep
[1:21:46] you from your purpose
[1:21:50] oh we gotta wake up oh my remember who
[1:21:53] your greatest enemy is who's your
[1:21:55] greatest enemy
[1:21:58] you know my greatest enemy is in the
[1:22:01] building
[1:22:03] your greatest enemy is here it's not
[1:22:05] your neighbor
[1:22:07] it's not your co-worker
[1:22:12] you're the Rascal
[1:22:15] and we have to wake up with a purpose
[1:22:20] that we got to possess this vessel with
[1:22:22] sanctification and honor
[1:22:26] we got to make it subject to the word
[1:22:28] and to know that we're here for a
[1:22:29] purpose
[1:22:32] what is your purpose
[1:22:35] remember it's not your occupation
[1:22:39] now that we want to be we want to be led
[1:22:41] by the Holy Spirit
[1:22:43] we want to be not hearers of the word
[1:22:46] only but we want to be doers of the word
[1:22:50] so then there should be a format if you
[1:22:53] will
[1:22:54] for your life
[1:22:59] not not tell you not to walk by not to
[1:23:01] walk by faith and to act like you'd have
[1:23:03] to have everything mapped out but we
[1:23:05] want to be looking unto the Lord for his
[1:23:07] leadership in his Direction
[1:23:11] if you're led by the spirit of God you
[1:23:13] are the sons of God
[1:23:16] but everything around you is pressing
[1:23:18] you in such a way it's trying to have
[1:23:21] you led by something else
[1:23:26] and I'm just trying maybe to tie
[1:23:28] something together what's causing us not
[1:23:31] to give in to that leadership it's the
[1:23:34] curse of this flesh don't you realize
[1:23:35] ever since Adam and Eve fail
[1:23:39] you're born under a curse
[1:23:43] Adam had Dominion
[1:23:46] Adam had control he he had full
[1:23:49] Authority there and until they came out
[1:23:51] from the protection of the word and he
[1:23:53] sold mankind into slavery
[1:23:57] he sold the world into death and into
[1:23:59] bondage and you're born under that curse
[1:24:04] that's why some of our lives
[1:24:07] maybe you came into a family that didn't
[1:24:09] even believe in God
[1:24:11] and you had hard family circumstances
[1:24:15] you experience things that that no
[1:24:18] little girl should ever experience
[1:24:21] and there's pains and there's hurts and
[1:24:23] there's things that have come upon your
[1:24:25] life that that that you feel like it's a
[1:24:27] curse
[1:24:30] because mankind oh mankind is rotten to
[1:24:33] the Core
[1:24:35] it's just a it's just a beast an animal
[1:24:41] if you don't believe me read the news
[1:24:44] but I don't recommend it
[1:24:47] prophet of God said in 1963 said if the
[1:24:50] world continues another 50 Years it'll
[1:24:52] be totally insane we're here
[1:24:54] look around we're here the world's
[1:24:56] totally insane
[1:25:00] and now we're living amongst a people
[1:25:03] that's totally insane and and born into
[1:25:05] family situations and generational sins
[1:25:08] and and generational curses and and
[1:25:11] medical conditions and all of these
[1:25:13] things and you feel like oh I'm living
[1:25:14] under a curse
[1:25:18] yeah maybe maybe so that's
[1:25:22] pretty good
[1:25:23] analogy
[1:25:26] because the world's cursed
[1:25:28] the flesh is cursed
[1:25:31] but I'm so glad I serve a god
[1:25:35] who knows how to take the curse
[1:25:40] and turn it into a blessing
[1:25:43] God knows how to take the mistakes
[1:25:47] he knows how to take
[1:25:50] things that were wrong he knows how to
[1:25:52] take
[1:25:55] the mistakes and the failures
[1:25:58] why don't you just let them go into your
[1:26:00] heart we'll try to come to a close
[1:26:02] quickly
[1:26:07] by Hearts desires I want to move into
[1:26:09] this realm
[1:26:11] of rapturing faith
[1:26:13] into the faith for this hour
[1:26:15] I I I I want to live what our pastor's
[1:26:18] been talking about about having having a
[1:26:21] faith that changes things I want to make
[1:26:23] an investment
[1:26:25] into the word of God that will produce
[1:26:27] the character of the word in me
[1:26:31] maybe maybe It just strikes me maybe
[1:26:34] maybe this is what the service needs to
[1:26:36] be about some of us just need to
[1:26:38] de-invest tonight
[1:26:40] there it is
[1:26:42] you know what that is
[1:26:44] you know what it means to deinvest
[1:26:47] if you've ever made an investment it
[1:26:49] means you you put money
[1:26:52] into maybe a program if you got stocks
[1:26:55] and bonds and all those things and and
[1:26:56] and you want to try to make some money
[1:26:59] and you're like okay well I'm going to
[1:27:01] put twenty thousand dollars on uh
[1:27:06] AI technology
[1:27:10] and you start looking at the stocks
[1:27:13] and the value is just going down
[1:27:16] what that means is
[1:27:18] your twenty thousand dollars is no
[1:27:20] longer worth twenty thousand dollars
[1:27:22] anymore
[1:27:23] because you bought into a company that's
[1:27:25] sinking
[1:27:27] and all of a sudden you're twenty
[1:27:29] thousand dollars is sixteen thousand
[1:27:31] dollars
[1:27:33] and then you keep thinking well I'm just
[1:27:35] gonna hold on here because it gots to
[1:27:36] rebound
[1:27:38] and then it gets down to ten thousand
[1:27:40] you start to think well I I better just
[1:27:41] take my money and run
[1:27:45] and right when you pull your money out
[1:27:46] it starts to climb back up
[1:27:50] and you're like oh man it's climbing
[1:27:52] fast
[1:27:53] I'm gonna put another 20 in there
[1:27:57] and then it starts going back down back
[1:28:00] down
[1:28:02] and you get on a little roller coaster
[1:28:04] ride
[1:28:07] and you get a year or two down the road
[1:28:09] and all of a sudden you realize I've
[1:28:11] lost thousands
[1:28:13] you know what
[1:28:15] I'm just gonna be done with this so when
[1:28:17] you deinvest you know what you do
[1:28:20] you take your money out of it
[1:28:23] I think some of us have invested our
[1:28:26] time
[1:28:28] and our effort
[1:28:29] into things that are failing
[1:28:35] and if this church this group of
[1:28:37] believers
[1:28:40] foreign
[1:28:41] if we could get in one mind
[1:28:45] and one Accord I even believe this at
[1:28:47] the end of this service
[1:28:49] if some of us right now can start to
[1:28:50] think I'm going to de-invest
[1:28:53] that game that boy that girl that career
[1:28:56] that job
[1:28:57] it's not according to the word of God
[1:29:00] Lord I'm going to de-invest right now
[1:29:01] forgive me
[1:29:03] that's all it takes
[1:29:05] that's it you know that's all it takes
[1:29:09] Lord I've made some bad decisions
[1:29:13] I I I got some deep scars
[1:29:18] but choose you this day
[1:29:21] you can continue that line
[1:29:24] and it can be a curse
[1:29:27] unless the musicians to come
[1:29:37] or you can
[1:29:39] choose life
[1:29:42] I believe that's what Deuteronomy would
[1:29:43] say and
[1:29:49] people put up Deuteronomy 30 19.
[1:29:54] maybe an awkward service but
[1:29:59] I believe God can take what would appear
[1:30:01] to be foolishness of man and do
[1:30:03] something
[1:30:04] Supernatural to the individual
[1:30:10] Deuteronomy 30 19 says I call Heaven and
[1:30:13] Earth
[1:30:15] to record this day against you
[1:30:18] that I have set before you life and
[1:30:20] death
[1:30:22] blessing and cursing
[1:30:26] therefore choose life
[1:30:29] that both thou and thy seed may live
[1:30:36] say Lord I want to deinvest
[1:30:40] oh if ananias and Sapphire could have
[1:30:42] done it all over
[1:30:46] they tried to make an investment
[1:30:49] into both
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:53] and I think that's maybe a lot of the
[1:30:55] problem that we have
[1:30:57] as we're trying to invest in both
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:01] we're trying to invest in the world
[1:31:03] okay
[1:31:05] and we're trying to invest into the
[1:31:06] spiritual
[1:31:09] if you sow to the flesh you shall reap
[1:31:11] corruption if you sow to the spirit
[1:31:14] you shall read righteousness
[1:31:18] but can
[1:31:20] both bitter and
[1:31:22] clean water come from the same fountain
[1:31:25] I say no
[1:31:29] maybe a a little bit of an
[1:31:31] evangelistical service or so tonight
[1:31:35] but if we can
[1:31:36] leave out of here feeling refreshed
[1:31:41] feeling cleansed
[1:31:44] can I say praise God
[1:31:51] I don't know what curse you're living
[1:31:52] under I don't know what
[1:31:54] decisions I don't know what
[1:31:57] Challengers you're facing and you feel
[1:32:01] you feel beat down and you feel like
[1:32:04] you're not making any progress
[1:32:07] you feel stale you feel like
[1:32:09] you haven't had a touch from the Lord in
[1:32:11] years
[1:32:14] why don't we change that tonight
[1:32:18] I know somebody that can do something
[1:32:20] for you
[1:32:24] some of you young people you were on
[1:32:25] fire for God
[1:32:28] I saw it
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:32] you get a little time down the down the
[1:32:34] down the way and it just seems like the
[1:32:36] fire starts to die out
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:39] but you know you can Stoke that fire
[1:32:40] tonight
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:43] every single one of us from the front to
[1:32:45] the back
[1:32:48] all it takes is to say you know what
[1:32:50] that's true Lord
[1:32:53] Here I Am Lord
[1:32:56] Lord what he's saying is true
[1:32:58] think about it think about what he done
[1:32:59] for you
[1:33:00] I think about our young sister coming
[1:33:02] back from camp and the power of dropped
[1:33:05] it to the van and all them young sisters
[1:33:07] were on fire for God
[1:33:10] by saying that's changed what I'm saying
[1:33:12] is he's the same yesterday today and
[1:33:14] forever
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:17] we go through Seasons we go through
[1:33:20] times we go we we we we we have uh
[1:33:24] Winters and springs and Summers but if
[1:33:26] I'm trying to convey that if if you're
[1:33:29] feeling you're not where you want to be
[1:33:32] foreign
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:39] let's just all bow our head
[1:33:42] Lord Jesus may be a little bit of a
[1:33:44] strange
[1:33:45] service tonight Lord
[1:33:49] but if it causes one sinner to repent
[1:33:51] more than
[1:33:56] maybe that's what it
[1:33:57] we need to do is de-invest
[1:34:02] we're living in an hour where we need to
[1:34:04] redeem the time and
[1:34:06] there's so many things pulling Upon Our
[1:34:08] Life Lord that we don't invest into the
[1:34:10] things that really matter
[1:34:12] relax
[1:34:13] Lord we we just want to tell you that
[1:34:16] we're sorry for that
[1:34:19] Lord I want to be on fire for you I want
[1:34:22] to
[1:34:23] ask that you forgive me Lord for
[1:34:25] not being diligent and being idle and
[1:34:29] not pressing for the kingdom like I
[1:34:31] should
[1:34:34] Lord I want to say as David say restore
[1:34:36] unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:34:40] Lord I'm thankful that you're able to
[1:34:43] take the curse and make it a blessing
[1:34:45] Lord
[1:34:46] you're able to take the
[1:34:49] things that are wrong
[1:34:52] the things that the devil tries to use
[1:34:54] against us to try to keep us from
[1:34:56] stepping out and taking you at your word
[1:35:00] it feels like those things just hang on
[1:35:02] to us and we feel like we can never
[1:35:03] break free but
[1:35:05] Lord I believe you're calling to your
[1:35:08] bride and to tell them look I I forgive
[1:35:10] you
[1:35:13] don't you worry about those things I can
[1:35:15] make all of those things that are wrong
[1:35:16] and make it right
[1:35:19] maybe somebody here just
[1:35:22] wants to lift their hand and say
[1:35:23] remember me in prayer
[1:35:27] those hands everywhere
[1:35:29] God bless you
[1:35:32] maybe there's somebody here that wants
[1:35:33] the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:38] you're ready to wake up
[1:35:41] and make a decision of why you're here
[1:35:45] maybe you want to
[1:35:47] let that devil know whose side you're
[1:35:50] really on and that you're tired
[1:35:52] of being pulled back and forth
[1:35:55] with every head bout is there's somebody
[1:35:57] here that would just want to lift their
[1:35:59] hand up and say I want the Holy Ghost
[1:36:03] God bless you
[1:36:05] God bless you
[1:36:09] we got real needs here tonight
[1:36:18] somebody here needs a real change
[1:36:22] going through the motions
[1:36:25] it's good God's proud of you you've been
[1:36:28] you've been doing good you've been
[1:36:31] doing the things that you need to do but
[1:36:33] something in your heart saying you know
[1:36:35] there's there's more for you
[1:36:38] and God's pleased that you're opening up
[1:36:40] your heart right now

[1:36:44] what God has for you God's dealing with
[1:36:46] somebody sovereignly

[1:37:00] in your heart then let that Nearness of
[1:37:02] a spirit that's coming to you right now

[1:37:07] all the things of the world

[1:37:14] that the Satan wants to offer
[1:37:16] but Lord I'll I want to deinvest
[1:37:21] and take all of my thoughts

[1:54:33] it's either to come and just dismiss us
[1:54:35] in prayer
[1:54:36] but let's keep the atmosphere
[1:54:41] it's many times after the word has gone
[1:54:43] forth that
[1:54:46] Revelation strikes the heart
[1:54:49] so
[1:54:51] water that word in your heart with
[1:54:53] Thanksgiving and praise and
[1:54:56] let God continue to move amongst younger
[1:55:05] let me add my two since What It's Worth
[1:55:08] to say I believe when we come with
[1:55:10] Thanksgiving in our heart
[1:55:16] for answered prayer that God has done
[1:55:21] it sets the atmosphere
[1:55:26] for God to do something else for you
[1:55:33] I think we ought to all be in a spirit
[1:55:35] of expectancy
[1:55:37] expectation Upon Our Hearts For What the
[1:55:39] Lord
[1:55:40] not only can do because we know he's
[1:55:42] all-powerful but what he is going to do
[1:55:45] and what he is doing
