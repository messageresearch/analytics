[3:30] good morning good morning welcome to the
[3:32] house of the Lord it's a beautiful day
[3:35] that the Lord has made I was thinking on
[3:37] the way to church this morning what a
[3:40] beautiful spring day we had but it's not
[3:42] springtime
[3:43] and I got to thinking
[3:45] of the spiritual application of that
[3:48] and you think the devil was gonna
[3:51] try to twist uh
[3:53] God's timeline too and we think all
[3:56] everything is all good and and pleasant
[3:58] and I want to stay here a while you know
[4:00] because it's more comfortable but uh
[4:02] it's still winter and man we're still in
[4:04] Satan's Eden and we're preparing to get
[4:06] out of here
[4:08] so uh let's not get comfortable we're
[4:10] gonna read from uh Psalm 32 this morning
[4:17] just get our Bibles ready and
[4:27] you know I have a friend uh maybe a
[4:29] friend all a lot of you uh brother Lindo
[4:31] yountz he wrote many
[4:34] uh very inspired songs
[4:37] and he he wrote a song
[4:40] one time it said uh
[4:43] it starts out said there's not a country
[4:46] in this world
[4:47] Kingdom or domain
[4:50] where the people can bow their head and
[4:53] talk to their King
[4:57] but we have that opportunity today
[5:00] the very creator of Heaven and Earth
[5:04] he said his eyes are over the righteous
[5:05] and his ears open under their prayer
[5:08] let's go before him today
[5:11] gracious and kind Heavenly Father Lord
[5:14] we come to you and
[5:16] you melody Lord
[5:20] the Lord will come as your children
[5:25] Lord we have the blood applied
[5:28] and knowing Lord that if it's under the
[5:30] blood then it's hidden from you Lord
[5:31] you've thrown it into the sea of your
[5:33] forgetfulness all of our wrongdoings our
[5:35] shortcomings Lord
[5:38] may we just leave those at the door of
[5:41] this place today Lord we come into this
[5:44] place has been Sanctified and set aside
[5:46] for your service for your praising for
[5:48] your worship
[5:50] and for the word of the Lord to come
[5:52] forth from this place
[5:54] Lord may it cleanse us from every
[5:55] unrighteousness granted this morning
[5:58] Lord as we enter into this we'll have a
[6:00] peace that goes beyond even our own
[6:02] mental understanding and our conceptions
[6:04] Lord
[6:05] that you can have your sweet Holy Spirit
[6:09] Sue this Lord and
[6:11] prepare us
[6:13] for the word that's to come forth Lord
[6:16] it'll it'll cut
[6:18] but Lord it cuts and separates us
[6:21] from the convictions and the wrongdoings
[6:23] and the things that would hinder Lord
[6:25] that's what we desire for Lord we
[6:28] understand by your word that this
[6:30] chastening is done by love Lord we
[6:33] appreciate the love of God
[6:35] we want it applied to our lives today
[6:36] Lord
[6:38] Lord as we come we know that there's
[6:40] many sick needy Lord there's some that
[6:43] may not even be able to be here this
[6:44] morning because of that condition
[6:46] but Lord we know that you're the
[6:48] all-sufficient Healer in every good and
[6:50] perfect gift
[6:52] your word says come down
[6:54] from the father of light
[6:56] in whom there's no variableness neither
[6:58] Shadow attorney
[7:00] Lord you forever remain the same
[7:02] your word is powerful and it's sharp
[7:04] Lord help us today Lord as we go forth
[7:08] we have such a lovely name of the Lord
[7:09] Jesus Christ amen
[7:12] amen
[7:14] you know I was speaking of that
[7:16] reverence and uh I've still got the book
[7:19] there where uh
[7:21] at the brothers breakfast we
[7:23] fellowshipped over uh
[7:24] the message desperations and brother
[7:27] Brown spoke on the token that morning
[7:31] and uh
[7:34] once you get into a message like that
[7:36] it's kind of hard to put it down there's
[7:38] so much in it but just one little
[7:40] verse here or paragraph
[7:44] because he was reflecting on his message
[7:46] which he said was
[7:48] he felt like the highlight of his
[7:50] ministry
[7:52] um in that evening service
[7:54] but he says the token Jesus Christ the
[7:57] holy spirit is Among Us
[8:00] we should reverence that
[8:02] we can't humble ourselves enough
[8:04] taking off your shoes
[8:07] or getting on your knees
[8:09] wouldn't satisfy
[8:11] wouldn't suffice us but a life that
[8:14] brings forth the fruit of the spirit
[8:16] amen granted this morning that we can
[8:19] have that life
[8:21] um
[8:22] Psalm 32 there's
[8:24] quite a lot in this little Passage Psalm
[8:27] of David
[8:28] it's a blessing to read
[8:32] the blessings of the Lord that's for
[8:34] sure but he says
[8:35] blessed is huge transgression Is
[8:37] Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is
[8:40] a man unto whom the Lord imputeth not
[8:42] iniquity and whose Spirit there is no
[8:44] guile
[8:45] Paul picks that up over in Romans
[8:47] 4.
[8:49] and he quotes David he said even as
[8:52] David also describeth the blessedness of
[8:54] the man to whom God imputed
[8:56] righteousness without work saying
[8:58] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[8:59] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[9:01] blessed is a man to whom the Lord will
[9:03] not impute sin and he continues on to
[9:05] talk about Abraham how it was imputed
[9:07] under him for righteousness sake
[9:10] and not through works and not through
[9:12] even circumcision or uncircumcision
[9:15] and I looked that up and that imputed in
[9:18] the in the Greek and the Hebrew is it
[9:20] wasn't laid to their charge so in the
[9:22] log of Heaven it's not imputed so you
[9:25] how can you be punished for something
[9:27] that's not imputed unto you so
[9:28] thankfully this morning as I said we put
[9:31] it under the blood
[9:33] and who's his duty bound to forgive us
[9:35] to be remembered no more amen so that's
[9:39] how we can boldly come before the throne
[9:41] of grace amen amen let's uh let's read
[9:44] that together
[9:46] and there's a there's a little
[9:47] instruction there toward the end
[9:50] um
[9:53] well he he actually says I will instruct
[9:55] thee and teach you in the way which thou
[9:57] shall go I will guide thee with my
[10:00] and I've been guilty of this it said be
[10:02] not as the horse of the mule which have
[10:04] no understanding whose mouth must be
[10:05] held in with bitten Bridal this to come
[10:07] near unto thee now it doesn't take a
[10:09] mature Christian to understand that
[10:10] headstrong and and uh stubbornness and
[10:14] everything else has to come under
[10:15] subjection to the word but
[10:17] and I'm not talking about just our
[10:19] attitudes even but some of the habits
[10:21] and everything else
[10:23] you know there's not a holiness
[10:25] that we can bring outside of his
[10:27] Holiness as he's already prepared for us
[10:29] amen let's read it together psalm 32.
[10:33] blessed is he whose transgression is
[10:36] Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is
[10:39] the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not
[10:41] iniquity and whose Spirit there is no
[10:44] God when I kept silence my bones waxed
[10:47] old through my roaring all the day long
[10:49] for day and night thy hand was Heavy
[10:52] upon me my moisture is turned into the
[10:55] drought of Summer Selah I acknowledge my
[10:58] sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not
[11:00] hid I said I will confess my
[11:03] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[11:05] forgavest the iniquity of my sin Selah
[11:08] for this shall every one for that is
[11:10] Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou
[11:13] mayest be found surely in the floods of
[11:16] Great Waters they shall not come nigh
[11:17] unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou
[11:21] shalt preserve me from trouble Thou
[11:23] shalt Compass me about what songs of
[11:25] Deliverance Selah I will instruct thee
[11:28] and teach thee in the way which Thou
[11:29] shalt go I will guide thee with mine I
[11:32] be not is the horse or as the mule which
[11:35] have no understanding whose mouth must
[11:37] be held in with bitten Bridle thus they
[11:40] come near unto thee many Sorrows shall
[11:42] be to the wicked but he that trusteth in
[11:45] the Lord Mercy shall Compass him about
[11:47] be glad in the Lord and rejoice you
[11:50] righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that
[11:53] are upright and hard
[12:03] Deeds

[46:06] amen amen God bless you
[46:10] foreign
[46:16] time ago
[46:19] one of my friends told me
[46:22] I believe it was brother Mike Patterson
[46:24] he he told me one day he said you know
[46:27] he says you can tell when you preach A
[46:30] good sermon if all the kids are asleep
[46:34] so amen so I hope he stays asleep
[46:38] and amen we're happy to be here this
[46:43] morning and be back and
[46:45] and uh as as many of you know that I
[46:48] haven't been uh
[46:50] feeling uh
[46:53] with a lot of strength in my uh body but
[46:57] uh I just want to share this with you I
[47:01] think that
[47:02] maybe you you have a right to know as a
[47:05] congregation I don't know if we can turn
[47:08] down the sound uh for what's going out
[47:12] on
[52:09] understand that and pray for me at this
[52:11] time if you would thank you very much
[52:15] I would like to um
[52:17] thank all the brothers that helped
[52:20] yesterday
[52:21] um and getting our property prepared
[52:25] we're in uh We've turned a corner and
[52:28] we're in the final stage of this next
[52:31] week you notice this big hole out here
[52:36] that's the preparation of the foundation
[52:39] and uh
[52:42] um when we took up the old parking lot
[52:45] we found out that all the dirt that was
[52:48] in the old parking lot
[52:50] um
[52:51] wasn't good enough to build
[52:54] a building on and we know as Christians
[52:58] right you've got to have the right
[53:00] foundation if you don't lay a good
[53:02] foundation then the building
[53:05] doesn't make it as long so
[53:08] we
[53:10] we had to take a bunch of dirt out of
[53:12] there and then put some dirty in and
[53:15] pack it down and then we have to bring
[53:18] in some special quality dirt to fill it
[53:22] in so we'll be ready to build it so we
[53:25] hope by the end of next week we'll be
[53:29] able to have
[53:30] our foundation boards laid out and that
[53:35] way you can look at it and see what the
[53:37] outside of the building would look this
[53:40] little Bridge here that you see where
[53:42] the concrete is tore up some of you
[53:45] walked across it's better if you use the
[53:47] parking lot to get to your cars and not
[53:50] use this walkway here that's mostly for
[53:54] the deacons to get back to my office but
[53:57] um
[53:58] uh that's where the building connects
[54:01] the two building connects so uh we just
[54:04] trust that next week we can have that
[54:07] done have all the grading done all the
[54:11] dirt hauled off and we're sitting right
[54:14] there ready
[54:16] um
[54:17] to start the foundation
[54:20] and where our goal is by the end of this
[54:23] month to have the foundation put in but
[54:27] we need a plumber
[54:29] so if any of you uh have a good plumber
[54:33] certainly let us know and we're looking
[54:37] for a plumber to do our plumbing but
[54:39] we're just ready on the verge to build
[54:43] so I went and talked to the city uh last
[54:46] year about this time last year I turned
[54:50] in our building
[54:52] plans and with a check for uh
[54:57] um you know seven thousand eight hundred
[55:00] dollars
[55:01] to review the plans
[55:05] so
[55:06] um you know nothing's free but so and uh
[55:11] the building inspector told me
[55:13] everything was
[55:14] okay and everything was done that the
[55:19] public works department that's the
[55:22] people that are in charge of the water
[55:23] the street and the drainage sign off on
[55:26] it well we finally are in our very final
[55:30] stages of the public works so I went to
[55:34] the city and said okay they're going to
[55:36] sign off next week I want to make my
[55:40] building
[55:41] permit application and then they
[55:45] informed me well we just sent your
[55:48] blueprints off to a third party
[55:51] uh
[55:52] and uh of course
[55:55] I don't know
[55:57] you know it puts it back out in limbo so
[55:59] I don't know how long it's going to take
[56:01] to get a third party review if they'll
[56:05] find something you know nobody likes
[56:08] third party
[56:10] you don't want to have a third party
[56:12] relationship with God because that third
[56:15] party will always find something wrong
[56:18] and uh so Eck and it is not so anyway
[56:23] every all the arrangements we have with
[56:25] the city I don't know they seem to got
[56:27] away somewhere but anyway I know that
[56:31] with prayer we can overcome everything
[56:34] so we're getting real close so Lord we
[56:37] bless you I know we're crowded here but
[56:40] when we get into the new building it'll
[56:43] be Deja Vu of about 20 years ago I went
[56:48] about 55 of us or 80 of us walked into
[56:51] this building
[56:53] and we ask ourselves what have we done
[56:55] what have we done and it wasn't close
[56:59] and intimate like it was but we had to
[57:02] grow into it so we trust that you'll all
[57:05] be with us this morning so let's stand
[57:08] this morning and open our Bibles and
[57:15] and you bear with me this morning uh
[57:21] and you fill in the blanks okay
[57:25] so you take your spirit and your
[57:28] knowledge of the word and you fill in
[57:30] the blank so we like to
[57:33] uh
[57:34] turn this morning to the book of
[57:38] Revelations the third chapter in the
[57:40] 14th verse
[57:44] and
[57:46] this is the description
[57:48] of our age
[57:51] and or I could say this to us this way
[57:54] this is the biblical description
[57:58] of the time and hour that you are living
[58:03] or the conditions of the time that
[58:06] you're living now man might describe
[58:09] this time different a time of great
[58:12] advancement a great technology great
[58:15] accomplished great scientific and social
[58:19] achievements okay they would have a
[58:22] completely different View
[58:24] of what is going on in the world and
[58:28] what that
[58:30] what the condition is but we don't care
[58:33] what man thinks amen man's been changing
[58:37] their give him a week
[58:39] they'll come up with something else you
[58:42] know what I mean they they feel they get
[58:45] a vaccine for one problem and something
[58:48] else comes up
[58:50] but so this is God's view
[58:52] of where that you are and what you are
[58:56] surrounded by let me say that again this
[59:00] is God's view of the time that you're
[59:03] living and what you are surrounded by
[59:08] and unto the angel
[59:11] of the Church of lady osia
[59:14] right these things saith the amen
[59:18] the faithful and true witness the
[59:22] beginning of the creation of God
[59:26] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[59:30] cold nor hot
[59:32] I would that work cold or hot
[59:38] so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[59:42] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[59:47] thee out of my mouth
[59:50] because thou saith I am rich
[59:53] and increase with Goods
[59:56] and have need of nothing
[59:59] and know us not that thou art wretched
[1:00:03] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:00:08] naked amen and don't know it
[1:00:13] Don't Know It This Is What God Says
[1:00:15] doubt saith I'm rich
[1:00:17] and increase with Goods
[1:00:20] and have need of nothing
[1:00:23] and no it's not
[1:00:25] that thou are wretched and miserable and
[1:00:28] poor blind and naked I counsel thee to
[1:00:32] buy of me gold tried in fire
[1:00:35] that thou mayest be rich
[1:00:38] and white random in that thou mayest be
[1:00:41] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:00:44] nakedness does not appear and anoint
[1:00:47] thine eyes with I saith that thou mayest
[1:00:51] see
[1:00:52] amen that's what you're here this
[1:00:55] morning for that's what we're here
[1:00:57] that's why we listen to a messenger the
[1:01:00] message of the hour is the isab for the
[1:01:03] believer
[1:01:05] uh and then this is the where we're
[1:01:09] getting our sermon from this morning as
[1:01:12] many as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[1:01:17] zealous therefore and repent
[1:01:20] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[1:01:24] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:01:28] I will come in to him I will come into
[1:01:33] him
[1:01:40] with the emphasis being upon him doing
[1:01:43] the work
[1:01:46] I will come into him and will sup with
[1:01:50] him and he with me
[1:01:53] to him that overcometh will like Grant
[1:01:55] to sit with me on my throne even as I
[1:01:59] also overcame and am set down with my
[1:02:03] father in his throne he that Kathy and
[1:02:07] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:02:10] unto the churches and then if you would
[1:02:14] turn over with me to uh
[1:02:17] first Peter
[1:02:21] the fourth chapter
[1:02:32] and let's start with the 16th verse
[1:02:41] yet if any man suffer as a Christian
[1:02:47] let him not be ashamed
[1:02:51] but let Him Glory by God
[1:02:54] on this behalf
[1:02:57] for the time has come
[1:03:00] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:03:05] God
[1:03:07] and if it first begins at us
[1:03:11] what shall the end be of them that obey
[1:03:16] not the gospel of God
[1:03:19] for if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:03:22] where shall the ungodly and The Sinner
[1:03:26] appear
[1:03:27] wherefore let them that suffer according
[1:03:30] to the will of God
[1:03:33] commit
[1:03:34] the keeping of their souls to him
[1:03:38] in well-doing as unto a faithful creator
[1:03:44] the commitment of their souls to him our
[1:03:50] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[1:03:52] word this morning in Jesus precious name
[1:03:55] we pray amen God bless you maybe
[1:04:00] seated this morning
[1:04:06] if I was to
[1:04:08] a title uh the sermon uh this morning
[1:04:14] and uh
[1:04:19] I would I wanted to call this sermon
[1:04:22] this morning
[1:04:24] the purpose of the Capstone
[1:04:27] the purpose of the Capstone
[1:04:31] and many of the uh
[1:04:34] quotations and thoughts and things come
[1:04:37] from
[1:04:38] the church age book and also the message
[1:04:42] a statue of a perfect man
[1:04:45] and we've been uh
[1:04:49] we've been studying and this is Blended
[1:04:53] into our study out of spoken word is the
[1:04:56] Original Seed
[1:04:58] now we understand that all things that
[1:05:01] were done
[1:05:03] and everything that was made that was
[1:05:07] made was made by the spoken word
[1:05:11] that God that within the father
[1:05:15] was uh
[1:05:18] thought or a decision I guess you could
[1:05:24] make or a plan that he had and that plan
[1:05:29] existed within him and that was the word
[1:05:34] and what is a word it's a thought
[1:05:36] expressed you don't know what somebody's
[1:05:39] thinking until that they speak that
[1:05:43] intention to you
[1:05:45] somebody might walk up to you and you
[1:05:49] might not know how they're thinking they
[1:05:52] might say oh I'm glad to see you
[1:05:55] or or they might say uh wow I never
[1:05:59] thought I'd see you here
[1:06:02] you don't know what they're thinking
[1:06:04] till that is expressed
[1:06:07] well God wanted to express to us what he
[1:06:11] was thinking what that he did what that
[1:06:14] he had he had a plan he he had an
[1:06:17] objective he had a motive he had a
[1:06:20] reason for doing the things that he was
[1:06:23] doing and now he is going to express
[1:06:26] those and in order to bring them to pass
[1:06:29] because there was nothing
[1:06:34] he was just the great all-sufficient one
[1:06:37] you know I don't know how man could ever
[1:06:40] bring themselves to think that two
[1:06:43] molecules bumped together out here in
[1:06:46] space somewhere and produced all this
[1:06:51] well if that was the case I wish it was
[1:06:53] different molecules
[1:06:55] because what It produced
[1:06:57] it isn't doing too good
[1:07:00] but when you understand that God
[1:07:02] produced it he was the creator the one
[1:07:06] that we're committing our spirits to and
[1:07:10] our souls do that he he had something in
[1:07:15] mind something that he wanted to do it's
[1:07:18] hard for us to find a vocabulary
[1:07:23] and words to express the Eternal but he
[1:07:27] who is without beginning and Without End
[1:07:31] he he he's he had something in his heart
[1:07:35] and that he wanted to do so he said let
[1:07:39] there be
[1:07:41] let there be in the beginning was the
[1:07:44] word in the beginning was God and God
[1:07:47] created the heavens and the Earth he
[1:07:51] spoke it into existence he said let this
[1:07:54] be let that be and there was he said let
[1:07:58] there be light and there was and we can
[1:08:01] understand that that now becomes the
[1:08:04] principle
[1:08:05] behind which everything
[1:08:08] that's ever accomplished is accomplished
[1:08:11] by the only thing that remains Heaven
[1:08:16] and Earth will pass away but my word
[1:08:19] will not pass away what God's original
[1:08:22] intention was what is original thinking
[1:08:26] was what his original plan was what his
[1:08:30] original creation was that he spoke
[1:08:33] that's the only thing that'll be in the
[1:08:36] end because it came from him it's
[1:08:40] eternal
[1:08:42] aren't you glad you were there
[1:08:45] in those thoughts because if you have
[1:08:49] eternal life you'll always have
[1:08:52] eternal life you always had it amen he
[1:08:56] knew you before the foundations of the
[1:08:59] world he knew the color of your hair the
[1:09:02] color of your eyes the statue that you
[1:09:05] would be in I know many times we don't
[1:09:07] feel like that could possibly be
[1:09:09] possible
[1:09:11] but he knew the beginning from the end
[1:09:14] he knew all of our mistakes
[1:09:17] he knew all of our failures
[1:09:20] he knows our regrets
[1:09:23] the things that we can look back upon
[1:09:26] and say I wish I'd never done that I
[1:09:29] wish I'd have never said that I I can't
[1:09:33] believe I got myself in this condition
[1:09:35] we could have a whole Litany of redo's
[1:09:40] that we would have in our life why'd we
[1:09:43] do this and I'd redo that and I would
[1:09:45] redo that but you want to know something
[1:09:47] you can do all the redos you wanted to
[1:09:50] do change where you were born change
[1:09:53] where you live change what you drive
[1:09:55] change the color of your skin the color
[1:09:57] of your eyes the color of your hair you
[1:10:00] can give yourself more hair or less hair
[1:10:02] it isn't going to change what God had in
[1:10:06] his mind of you from the beginning
[1:10:12] we don't need to get hung up
[1:10:15] on the in between
[1:10:17] amen we go until we come to that day of
[1:10:20] real realization
[1:10:23] that God's got a plan for our life and
[1:10:26] the scripture teaches us that we leave
[1:10:28] those things which are behind behind and
[1:10:31] we press for the higher calling in
[1:10:34] Christ Jesus
[1:10:36] that calling existed before you got here
[1:10:40] he knew exactly what he wanted to do
[1:10:42] with your life
[1:10:44] he knew exactly the trouble that you
[1:10:47] would have
[1:10:48] and he made a provision
[1:10:50] for it he's Jehovah Jireh
[1:10:54] God will provide and take care of us
[1:10:58] if so we received from the
[1:11:02] great creation
[1:11:04] of God and the great uh
[1:11:09] work that God's doing that God has
[1:11:12] something that he had in mind and God
[1:11:17] being an evolutionist that he he he
[1:11:20] likes to unfold itself
[1:11:24] and unveil itself so he just didn't
[1:11:27] create the world in one
[1:11:31] uh session maybe we could say it like
[1:11:34] that or just one thing and say Let There
[1:11:37] Be the world boom it was there and all
[1:11:40] the palm trees are there and the trees
[1:11:41] were there and the world was there and
[1:11:44] Wham there it was no Pete he did it in
[1:11:48] stages
[1:11:50] I I don't know uh why I know it my
[1:11:56] nature is not to have stages
[1:11:59] you know if the if the on the bottle or
[1:12:02] the can or whatever the product is if it
[1:12:05] says wait 30 minutes to mix well two is
[1:12:09] good enough for me
[1:12:12] you know if it says lay a thin coat well
[1:12:15] that's uh thin coat well you know what's
[1:12:18] thin you know let's get it done but
[1:12:21] God's got a reason that he does things
[1:12:24] that he's got a reason why he created
[1:12:27] this he's got a reason why he's done
[1:12:29] that and I want that to settle in your
[1:12:32] heart because he has a reason for the
[1:12:37] things that he allows
[1:12:42] when I just went through my little uh
[1:12:45] incident I shared with you
[1:12:48] you know I thought my questions was you
[1:12:51] know how could this happen to me
[1:12:54] you know why would God allow that to
[1:12:57] come in my life but he knows why
[1:13:00] you know if I could say well was I in
[1:13:03] the permissive will of God it wouldn't
[1:13:06] matter
[1:13:07] because he promised he would take the
[1:13:10] permissive will and work it for the
[1:13:12] perfect will so he's got a perfect will
[1:13:15] for our lives we struggle through that
[1:13:18] and we fight it and we cause ourselves a
[1:13:22] lot of trouble and like Paul Paul goes
[1:13:25] out and he's persecuting the very church
[1:13:27] that he's a messenger to
[1:13:31] or that he's going to come out of he's
[1:13:34] taking Christians and turning them over
[1:13:36] to the priest and binding them up and
[1:13:38] taking him to prison
[1:13:40] he's witnessing the stoning
[1:13:43] in other words consenting
[1:13:47] do the taking of us
[1:13:50] a Saint's life
[1:13:54] you know holding the coats and standing
[1:13:57] there all Pious and self-righteous
[1:14:00] like he's doing God a service
[1:14:03] and he's taken one of the first Martyrs
[1:14:06] of the church and he's he's part of that
[1:14:10] uh uh event that's taking place thinking
[1:14:15] he's doing God of service
[1:14:20] you wonder why it Paul had to go out on
[1:14:23] the backside of the desert until he got
[1:14:26] everything straightened out in his heart
[1:14:28] in his mind with God because he had a
[1:14:31] lot of going on in his mind
[1:14:34] and we go through those battles maybe
[1:14:38] not as severe because we might not have
[1:14:40] had to carry the load that he carried
[1:14:42] but nevertheless that's what the Lord
[1:14:45] told me says Paul you're going to have
[1:14:47] to find out it's hard to fight against
[1:14:50] my will for your life it's hard to kick
[1:14:53] against the prayer it's hard to go
[1:14:56] against what I've already thought and
[1:14:58] called you to do you're going to be my
[1:15:00] Messenger to the Gentiles
[1:15:04] and you're talking to a guy who believes
[1:15:06] that Christians are Heretics
[1:15:10] oh don't be afraid of where your life
[1:15:12] was he can take you and do it seemingly
[1:15:15] wonderful things with you
[1:15:22] he just praised God puts it under the
[1:15:25] blood
[1:15:26] aren't you happy for the blood this
[1:15:28] morning aren't you happy for the love of
[1:15:31] God
[1:15:32] so if we find out that
[1:15:35] he's got a will
[1:15:38] and even when the Lord they said father
[1:15:40] teach us to pray he says Our Father
[1:15:43] which art in heaven
[1:15:45] Hallowed be thy name thy will be done
[1:15:52] amen isn't that the Cry of each of our
[1:15:55] hearts
[1:15:57] we don't want God to be part-time
[1:16:00] in our lives
[1:16:02] amen if we if we and I can stand here
[1:16:06] this morning
[1:16:07] speaking from my own position that we
[1:16:12] have things that we have to overcome
[1:16:17] I believe brother Tim's
[1:16:20] admonishment this morning and
[1:16:22] and exhortation
[1:16:24] led us to understand that we have a God
[1:16:28] that's going to take us through
[1:16:31] so we realized then that in this great
[1:16:36] purpose of God in this great plan of God
[1:16:40] he had a way that he was going to
[1:16:43] perform it
[1:16:45] he had a way he was going to do it he
[1:16:48] had a way that he was going to deal with
[1:16:51] the hearts and lives of men and he's
[1:16:55] been a state true to the way that he's
[1:17:00] doing things
[1:17:01] and in this morning as we talk about uh
[1:17:06] the purpose of the Capstone
[1:17:11] and uh
[1:17:14] I'd like to kind of on
[1:17:17] unfold this up I could say it this way
[1:17:19] is that
[1:17:22] God has a requirement
[1:17:26] when God put this plan
[1:17:30] of Salvation and and uh he put forth
[1:17:38] uh his creation
[1:17:41] this creation was governed by his word
[1:17:45] so the way the plants came out the way
[1:17:49] that the seeds uh grew up in the tree
[1:17:52] and created a fruit and then that fruit
[1:17:56] would fall under the ground and that
[1:17:59] seed would go in and that seed would go
[1:18:02] back into the ground and it would take
[1:18:04] light and water and and the nutrients
[1:18:08] from the earth that the very fruit of it
[1:18:12] provided back into the Earth and the
[1:18:14] life would again come forth and and the
[1:18:19] life of animals in the life of men and
[1:18:22] the life of of creation would would had
[1:18:26] a law that governed it and allowed it to
[1:18:30] live and go forward
[1:18:33] but man broke that law
[1:18:37] and therefore death
[1:18:39] came in the wages of sin is death the
[1:18:45] gift of God is eternal life now ignoring
[1:18:49] God
[1:18:51] does not stop God's plan
[1:18:56] you can't get out of God's plan
[1:18:59] you can't say okay I don't believe it
[1:19:03] God doesn't exist
[1:19:05] that's like an ostrich
[1:19:08] sticking his head in the sand and saying
[1:19:11] the sun's not shining
[1:19:13] or someone going into a dark Cellar and
[1:19:16] living in darkness and saying there's no
[1:19:20] really such thing as the sun and the
[1:19:24] star and the moon no okay you're
[1:19:27] self-created idea does not change the
[1:19:31] reality of God's word
[1:19:35] God's word is going on the same
[1:19:38] regardless of what men says is going on
[1:19:43] and we saw that in lady Joseph saying
[1:19:47] you're rich they'll say you're
[1:19:49] prospering Hallelujah I got a new uh
[1:19:54] you know people phone model 579.
[1:20:03] whoopee I'm rich
[1:20:07] everybody trying to show how rich they
[1:20:09] are
[1:20:12] you know
[1:20:13] Dress for Success
[1:20:16] you think you can dress your way into
[1:20:18] heaven
[1:20:20] there's only one person that can trusts
[1:20:23] you for heaven
[1:20:30] that's why we're preaching the purpose
[1:20:33] of the Capstone man's view of things
[1:20:37] and what man thinks is going on
[1:20:41] I heard on the news that the uh they
[1:20:44] they had a athlete a professional
[1:20:47] athlete young man I guess 23 years old
[1:20:51] this Prime of Life uh just a uh what we
[1:20:55] would think is a virtue of Health you
[1:20:58] know
[1:20:59] uh the Richard Simmons of football
[1:21:03] the
[1:21:05] that was some old people laughing there
[1:21:10] you guys don't know who Richard Simmons
[1:21:12] is don't even pretend you do
[1:21:18] but
[1:21:21] he has a heart attack
[1:21:25] just like that
[1:21:27] you don't know what health is
[1:21:31] he has your health
[1:21:33] I love when our messenger told us if God
[1:21:37] wants to take you home there's not
[1:21:39] enough doctors and hospitals and
[1:21:41] medicines to keep you here that's right
[1:21:45] and if God wants you to stay
[1:21:49] there's not enough sicknesses or Devils
[1:21:51] or things to take you
[1:21:56] amen if we're going through a hard time
[1:21:59] we committed into the hands of our
[1:22:02] creator who knows all things that's
[1:22:05] right
[1:22:06] so the things aren't the way that people
[1:22:10] say there are they're the way that the
[1:22:12] word says they are
[1:22:16] and that's why we pray for revelation
[1:22:19] we pray for the view point of Life
[1:22:23] Through The Eyes of the word of God you
[1:22:27] look at something Through The Eyes of
[1:22:29] the word it's totally different
[1:22:32] than what you think
[1:22:37] many times I've got so upset over
[1:22:40] circumstances
[1:22:42] so frustrated at what I perceived as
[1:22:48] being fair or unfair or just an unjust
[1:22:52] and
[1:22:53] went through stress and anger and act
[1:22:57] frustration and and all the emotions and
[1:23:02] everything all over something that was
[1:23:05] in his hands all the time
[1:23:10] with a promise
[1:23:12] that nothing could pluck me out of the
[1:23:15] palm of his hand
[1:23:20] you might try to jump out
[1:23:22] but good luck
[1:23:28] Paul was trying to kill the very hands
[1:23:30] that were holding him
[1:23:34] so God's got something that's going on
[1:23:38] and I'll move quickly now because I
[1:23:40] don't think I I'd like to preach longer
[1:23:43] than I can
[1:23:46] but so we understand that God has a
[1:23:50] requirement
[1:23:51] that God's requiring something
[1:23:55] that he desires and something that that
[1:23:59] when he put his uh aspect in there one
[1:24:04] of the things he said that the wages of
[1:24:07] sin or unbelief is death
[1:24:10] but the gift of God is eternal life now
[1:24:14] the requirement never went away
[1:24:17] you're a sinner
[1:24:21] that requires death
[1:24:26] but what what happened for us
[1:24:29] we had a Kinsmen
[1:24:32] we had someone that came from the father
[1:24:35] because the father so loved the world he
[1:24:38] gave his only begotten son he so loved
[1:24:42] us to that because of the nature that we
[1:24:46] inherited from our unbelieving parents
[1:24:51] that that
[1:24:53] automatically our lives were contrary to
[1:24:58] the word of God because we were born in
[1:25:01] sin she shaped into iniquity and came
[1:25:05] into the world speaking lies I don't
[1:25:08] care what religion you are
[1:25:11] you can be a Hindu you can be a Buddhist
[1:25:14] you can be whatever that
[1:25:17] witch doctory that you want to be in or
[1:25:20] or or
[1:25:22] denominationals or it doesn't matter
[1:25:24] every man that's born is born in sin
[1:25:28] shaped in iniquity and is a liar
[1:25:35] but something had to pay the price
[1:25:38] because that was the requirement
[1:25:42] but aren't you glad that that
[1:25:46] there was someone that came in meant the
[1:25:49] requirement for you
[1:25:52] don't ever forget that we don't just
[1:25:55] believe in the Lord Jesus because he's a
[1:25:58] historical fact
[1:26:01] or because he was the one that done so
[1:26:04] many good works and and lived such a
[1:26:07] example of a life and we still sit back
[1:26:11] and we honor him for what that he was
[1:26:15] well we do that for George Washington
[1:26:19] Abraham Lincoln
[1:26:22] This Love
[1:26:24] is scarce
[1:26:29] he laid down his life
[1:26:32] for you
[1:26:34] for you personally he personally came
[1:26:38] and took the consequences
[1:26:43] of all that
[1:26:45] was laid to your charge
[1:26:48] and he redeemed those and paid the price
[1:26:52] for those
[1:26:53] and took that chastisement
[1:26:58] of your sins
[1:27:00] the punishment the requirement of death
[1:27:04] for your sins that was upon you
[1:27:08] personally
[1:27:10] not the church not the world Me Mine
[1:27:18] and paid them for me
[1:27:21] perfect
[1:27:23] as undeserving and as ungrateful
[1:27:28] and is unmindful of him that I was
[1:27:33] he did it
[1:27:35] because he loved me
[1:27:38] there was a requirement
[1:27:42] that had to be
[1:27:44] meant
[1:27:46] and it had to be
[1:27:52] built
[1:27:54] and paid for
[1:27:57] and he he took care of that
[1:28:00] so when we
[1:28:02] come up
[1:28:05] and I'm just going to maybe read or go
[1:28:09] through some of this quickly
[1:28:11] with us
[1:28:13] but there's a requirement
[1:28:15] for this age
[1:28:18] because God knew that he would have a
[1:28:21] people here
[1:28:23] and God never created without purpose
[1:28:28] everything that was created
[1:28:31] manifested a part of God
[1:28:35] the invisible things of God are clearly
[1:28:38] seen in the things that are created
[1:28:42] around us we saw God in nature the first
[1:28:46] Bible was written in the Zodiac in the
[1:28:49] Stars after we can see God in nature we
[1:28:53] can see God their death burial and
[1:28:55] Resurrection through the seasons all
[1:28:58] around us God has put himself in
[1:29:01] Creation in in the great complexity and
[1:29:05] beauty of creation that was a part of
[1:29:09] his attributes on display that glorified
[1:29:13] him
[1:29:15] it's only man that's been messed this
[1:29:18] place up
[1:29:21] God had it beautiful in order
[1:29:24] and man took it apart
[1:29:26] slowly but surely but it never changed
[1:29:30] the plan of God
[1:29:32] that quick I want to base this starting
[1:29:36] this morning because it never changed
[1:29:39] the plan of God
[1:29:41] God had something he wanted to
[1:29:44] accomplish in this time with this people
[1:29:54] he chose you to be here
[1:29:58] in this time
[1:30:00] he wrote your name on The Book of Life
[1:30:04] and he put your birth date
[1:30:08] you're starting and you're in and what
[1:30:13] that he in his heart and mind had spoken
[1:30:17] for you to become
[1:30:22] now don't forget what we're talking
[1:30:24] about this morning is the purpose of the
[1:30:27] Capstone
[1:30:29] so God didn't put you
[1:30:31] on life like a rat in a maze
[1:30:38] and just say if you can get through the
[1:30:40] Maze and get down through the corners
[1:30:42] and and all the wrong turns and come out
[1:30:45] on the other side
[1:30:47] good for you little rat
[1:30:52] you made it no
[1:30:55] no
[1:30:55] he's there at every turn
[1:30:58] he's there at every corner you
[1:31:01] understand he's leading you somewhere
[1:31:03] because one if you to to get somewhere
[1:31:07] there's something that he's trying to
[1:31:09] accomplish he has a purpose for this age
[1:31:13] he has a requirement that every person
[1:31:17] that he's placed here he has a
[1:31:20] requirement that they must fulfill
[1:31:24] and as if he spoken of you then that's a
[1:31:28] requirement that you have to meet in
[1:31:31] order for you to confess that you're the
[1:31:34] word of God
[1:31:38] if not you've just built a religion and
[1:31:41] an altar and you're saying Here's My
[1:31:44] Sacrifice God here's my altar here's my
[1:31:48] life judge it whether it's worthy
[1:31:51] well your righteousness is as filthy Ray
[1:31:55] Hallelujah
[1:31:57] what is somebody that's born in sin
[1:31:59] shaped in iniquity comes into the world
[1:32:02] speaking lies doesn't even know the mind
[1:32:05] of God gonna produce anything that's
[1:32:08] acceptable to him
[1:32:13] ah
[1:32:16] I don't think I want to offer what I've
[1:32:18] done to them
[1:32:21] I want to become a part of what he's
[1:32:24] doing
[1:32:26] so let me move on if you would help and
[1:32:30] bear with me this morning
[1:32:37] you know I love this statement
[1:32:40] he says if God gave me a natural life
[1:32:45] he can give me a spiritual life
[1:32:52] did that sink in
[1:32:55] he gave you a natural life right you get
[1:32:58] up in the morning you breathe you eat
[1:33:01] Hallelujah you get hungry
[1:33:05] he gave you life
[1:33:08] he gave you breath
[1:33:10] you live you cold places you see you
[1:33:14] meet people you feel if he gave you
[1:33:16] Natural Life
[1:33:19] he can give me a spiritual life
[1:33:22] if God could give me the first birth
[1:33:26] he could give me the second birth
[1:33:31] amen
[1:33:34] if God can heal this by Divine Healing
[1:33:38] he can raise it up again to his glory in
[1:33:42] the last day isn't that right
[1:33:45] so we can see by the very things that we
[1:33:49] have what he's capable of doing
[1:33:54] but our nature is to sell him short
[1:33:59] we put limitations on them we we only
[1:34:03] let him go as far as our imagination
[1:34:06] will let him go or as far as the
[1:34:09] circumstances and situations that that
[1:34:12] we we can comprehend that none of that
[1:34:16] affects him because he's the Creator
[1:34:23] and actually Peter said we commit
[1:34:25] ourselves into the god the Creator
[1:34:30] that's what our life's in
[1:34:32] it's the hands of a person and a God
[1:34:36] that loves us that can change things
[1:34:42] the great creator
[1:34:45] and so we realize as we go
[1:34:49] he says and so God's got a requirement
[1:34:53] and the scripture says this in Matthew 5
[1:34:56] 48 he says be therefore perfect
[1:35:04] wow what's that perfect
[1:35:08] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:35:18] how do you like that requirement
[1:35:23] any takers
[1:35:26] no I shrink back
[1:35:29] because
[1:35:30] the first thing that I want to say is I
[1:35:33] can't be perfect
[1:35:38] but he said be therefore perfect
[1:35:43] now
[1:35:46] we are so carnal
[1:35:48] we think he put that burden on us
[1:35:56] be ye perfect
[1:35:58] that's just like him looking at a sick
[1:36:01] person and say be ye home
[1:36:07] he's not talking to the man and saying
[1:36:09] make yourself whole
[1:36:12] he's not looking at you and saying make
[1:36:15] yourself perfect but he's saying be
[1:36:18] perfect
[1:36:20] let there be light Let There Be air let
[1:36:25] there be let there be let there dare be
[1:36:29] ye perfect Hallelujah
[1:36:34] what a prophecy
[1:36:38] what a blessing
[1:36:40] what an anointing
[1:36:42] what a gift
[1:36:48] be perfect
[1:36:51] oh
[1:36:52] am I going to carry that cross
[1:36:55] be perfect
[1:36:57] be perfect
[1:37:00] oh mirror mirror on the wall is there
[1:37:03] anybody perfect there at all
[1:37:08] what do you have staring back at you
[1:37:13] your memory
[1:37:14] your emotions
[1:37:19] your senses
[1:37:23] ah
[1:37:24] be he perfect
[1:37:28] what a requirement
[1:37:31] what a great requirement that that's
[1:37:34] being spoken
[1:37:37] he he says
[1:37:40] so he's talking in the Statue of the
[1:37:42] perfect man
[1:37:43] and he's saying you start out as we can
[1:37:46] see on our board we know that we start
[1:37:48] out with faith and and and we begin to
[1:37:51] build upon those things and he's he he's
[1:37:55] building up so he says
[1:37:59] when you get down here a genuine born
[1:38:02] dove
[1:38:04] then you don't add nothing
[1:38:07] it's added to you see
[1:38:10] comes on up all right coming into
[1:38:14] Perfection now
[1:38:18] so he spoke to the church be perfect
[1:38:22] and now he's going to build this church
[1:38:26] and make this church perfect
[1:38:28] but he's got a plan in a way that he's
[1:38:31] doing it
[1:38:35] just like he built the Earth
[1:38:39] he builds the church
[1:38:41] and just the way he builds the church he
[1:38:44] builds the individual
[1:38:48] and and so
[1:38:51] so all along this journey
[1:38:54] were uh
[1:38:57] were adding and we're building coming up
[1:39:00] through seven Church ages
[1:39:02] to add the Capstone
[1:39:05] many of you know that we have it over
[1:39:07] here
[1:39:09] on the board we've got a Teddy kid I
[1:39:13] believe Drew this for me about 40 years
[1:39:17] ago
[1:39:19] someone's come and says Oh Brother
[1:39:21] McGarry I'd really like to take that
[1:39:22] down and redo it make it look good
[1:39:25] you ain't gonna have the love in it that
[1:39:27] that boy had in it
[1:39:30] so that's special to me
[1:39:32] so anybody that needs an explanation
[1:39:35] that we can't do better in this
[1:39:37] computerized age that's why I like
[1:39:40] people I don't care if they sing good at
[1:39:42] all but if they seem from their heart
[1:39:44] it's music to my ears
[1:39:47] but anyway we know we have faith and
[1:39:50] virtue and knowledge and Temperance and
[1:39:53] uh here it is out of the church eight
[1:39:55] books a week we can see those things
[1:39:58] there and all the time God's working
[1:40:01] right he's building
[1:40:04] and we're not going to go into what each
[1:40:06] of those virtues are we're not going to
[1:40:08] go on how they type with the ages and
[1:40:11] everything but we just want to lay this
[1:40:13] quick principle down
[1:40:16] he says now in building The Virtue
[1:40:20] building this Monument building this
[1:40:23] statue
[1:40:25] foreign
[1:40:27] you see it it starts off with a
[1:40:29] foundation stone Faith virtual knowledge
[1:40:33] Temperance patances goodliness brotherly
[1:40:35] kindness now what does it do
[1:40:38] they were waiting for the headstone
[1:40:42] which is love
[1:40:46] for God is love
[1:40:50] so now we're talking this morning about
[1:40:52] the purpose of the Capstone
[1:40:56] and
[1:40:58] I'll wait and finish this and try to
[1:41:01] make something clearer before I go on
[1:41:04] he says Melody kindness now what does it
[1:41:07] do
[1:41:09] then they're waiting for the headstone
[1:41:11] which is love for God is love
[1:41:14] he controls and he is the strength of
[1:41:19] every one of these that's right yes sir
[1:41:24] so he's the
[1:41:26] leave that back up there I like that
[1:41:31] where'd they go
[1:41:34] they disappeared
[1:41:37] so all those he's the strength
[1:41:42] you understand he's the one that's
[1:41:45] putting them together
[1:41:46] he's the one that's building this and
[1:41:50] letting it out Through the Ages bringing
[1:41:53] it out bringing it Forward nobody
[1:41:56] mustered it all
[1:42:01] you weren't born the day that you were
[1:42:03] born a Christian you didn't walked out a
[1:42:06] a a Super Saiyan
[1:42:10] I was so happy when I got saved
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:18] I even got a musical amen
[1:42:22] I'll tell you I was like a
[1:42:26] I was going to say a butterfly but I was
[1:42:28] like an eagle
[1:42:29] out of the bullbrush
[1:42:33] I didn't think that I thought I was
[1:42:36] there
[1:42:37] until I got my first correction
[1:42:43] that was a rude awakening
[1:42:47] so we're going to go down so he says
[1:42:49] right here right here you see I got in
[1:42:53] between all these works here
[1:42:56] and these little waves coming
[1:43:00] what is that
[1:43:02] the holy ghost coming down through
[1:43:04] Christ see the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:43:07] spirit is above all this welding This
[1:43:11] Together building a perfect church for
[1:43:15] the Capstone to cap it off
[1:43:18] now we're talking about what is the
[1:43:21] purpose of the Capstone
[1:43:25] read down here farther he says
[1:43:29] here you are
[1:43:32] seven Church ages seven steps God
[1:43:36] building his church is like one person
[1:43:40] into an individual into himself
[1:43:45] the glory the power of God coming down
[1:43:48] through this welding it together
[1:43:52] therefore the Pentecostal people
[1:43:55] that let out the that led out
[1:43:59] the lutherans
[1:44:01] then let out the West wesleyans
[1:44:05] and things doesn't know what they're
[1:44:08] talking about
[1:44:09] you see they lived in this part of the
[1:44:13] Temple
[1:44:14] that's the way some people come up that
[1:44:18] high and drop off
[1:44:20] but there's a genuine part of that keeps
[1:44:24] making that building come on I will
[1:44:27] restore saith the Lord so it's coming on
[1:44:32] there's something that made
[1:44:37] where'd my thing go
[1:44:39] just leave it up there don't put the
[1:44:42] quotes up there
[1:44:44] great
[1:44:47] okay
[1:44:48] so we see that each one of those came
[1:44:51] out of the other one it's coming out
[1:44:54] there's a spirit building it together
[1:44:56] coming out coming out bringing it up
[1:44:59] working it towards perfection
[1:45:02] that so he's got the seven Church ages
[1:45:04] he's got the seven Messengers he's got
[1:45:07] the whole church coming up he's got the
[1:45:10] individual coming up everything's coming
[1:45:13] up and it just it just keeps on coming
[1:45:18] all right okay so you got to understand
[1:45:23] we're coming
[1:45:25] we're coming up he said now someone in
[1:45:29] here they if they could only go so far
[1:45:33] they dropped off
[1:45:34] and they didn't know anything else about
[1:45:37] any of the other stuff the church that
[1:45:40] was under Martin and and Colombo in them
[1:45:45] they were almost Catholic
[1:45:49] they knew nothing of justification
[1:45:56] they lived as best as they could
[1:45:59] to the teachings that were made
[1:46:01] available to them
[1:46:05] by the church
[1:46:09] no don't be like dumb driven cattle this
[1:46:12] morning
[1:46:16] it's been given to you
[1:46:18] to know the Mysteries
[1:46:23] you're a very privileged people this
[1:46:25] morning you're very blessed this morning
[1:46:28] you're elected you're chosen for
[1:46:31] something
[1:46:32] he says
[1:46:34] he says and then he talks about the
[1:46:36] bright tree
[1:46:39] he says now the way God is expecting us
[1:46:44] as an individual to grow
[1:46:47] God is expecting us as an individual to
[1:46:51] grow
[1:46:56] the way he has brought his church in to
[1:47:01] grow
[1:47:01] every Church age it must become one big
[1:47:05] church see
[1:47:07] these fellas wasn't required what these
[1:47:11] fellows are
[1:47:13] so each of those age had a requirement
[1:47:15] they weren't required what the next age
[1:47:18] is required they weren't required what
[1:47:20] the next age was required some of them
[1:47:23] only went so far and they dropped out
[1:47:25] but that's not where you are
[1:47:29] you have a different requirement
[1:47:38] s he said
[1:47:40] you see he brought his church up this he
[1:47:43] said now these times wasn't required
[1:47:46] what these fellows are this wasn't
[1:47:48] required what this was see he brought
[1:47:51] his church up the same way
[1:47:54] he brought his church up the same way
[1:47:57] he's bringing his
[1:47:59] his people up
[1:48:02] then Peter said here
[1:48:04] First Seven Things Faith virtue
[1:48:07] knowledge Temperance godliness Brotherly
[1:48:10] Love brotherly kindness and then love of
[1:48:14] God the holy
[1:48:16] ghost Christ in the person of the Holy
[1:48:20] Spirit
[1:48:22] comes upon you
[1:48:24] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:28] and you've got all these virtues sealed
[1:48:31] in you
[1:48:31] then God lives in the Tabernacle called
[1:48:35] the building the living Tabernacle of
[1:48:39] the living God's Dwelling Place
[1:48:45] now you can go back and put that up
[1:48:49] I can't see him back there I think
[1:48:51] they're probably doing it from some
[1:48:52] they're they're they're somebody
[1:48:55] okay that was paragraph 341.
[1:48:59] 342.
[1:49:01] when a man possesses these kinds of
[1:49:04] things
[1:49:06] then the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[1:49:09] no matter you might speak with tongues
[1:49:13] you might impersonate any gift that
[1:49:15] God's Got
[1:49:17] you might do that but until these
[1:49:20] virtues here goes into you you're still
[1:49:24] off the real true foundation of faith
[1:49:30] now this is scary to me
[1:49:36] because if you start judging yourself
[1:49:43] you're going to raise a great big
[1:49:45] question Market confusion because he
[1:49:48] just said when you come into a perfect
[1:49:50] man then the Holy Ghost comes
[1:49:54] wait a minute
[1:49:55] I already thought I got the Holy Ghost
[1:49:57] you did
[1:50:02] but this this
[1:50:04] is a different
[1:50:07] has a different purpose
[1:50:11] okay that spirit that you got when you
[1:50:13] got saved was welding these things in
[1:50:16] you
[1:50:17] was growing these things in you he was
[1:50:21] bringing you to these things getting you
[1:50:24] to the place that this Capstone could
[1:50:27] come
[1:50:29] you understand that
[1:50:30] so when a man he says the Holy Spirit
[1:50:33] comes upon him
[1:50:34] then we go down here he says well he
[1:50:38] says and when we got in imaginary way
[1:50:45] he says he says let me read 3 43. but
[1:50:49] you know the Heathen they prostrate
[1:50:52] themselves before an idol imaginary God
[1:50:56] and in an imaginary way they believed
[1:51:00] that that
[1:51:03] idle imaginary God in an imaginary way
[1:51:07] they believed that that imaginary God
[1:51:10] speaks back to them
[1:51:17] well
[1:51:20] that's hedonism
[1:51:22] that's romanism
[1:51:24] they bow to all kinds of saints and
[1:51:27] everything else
[1:51:28] they have Saint Cecilia a house of God
[1:51:31] so many different things like that they
[1:51:34] bow to that and actually believe in the
[1:51:38] imaginary way what a type it is of the
[1:51:42] true Living God
[1:51:44] but when we not in an imaginary way but
[1:51:49] prostrate ourselves before a living God
[1:51:51] a living virtue a living knowledge a
[1:51:55] living patience a living loving kindness
[1:52:00] a living power to come from a living God
[1:52:04] makes a living man that's living image
[1:52:09] of the stature of God what
[1:52:13] what's he doing
[1:52:18] so we're not talking we're talking about
[1:52:20] a living virtue
[1:52:22] the living knowledge some in that living
[1:52:25] all these things are living they're all
[1:52:27] things he's putting forth
[1:52:29] and so I'm just with that Foundation
[1:52:32] laid I want to just move on and and just
[1:52:36] say these things and I'll I'll read this
[1:52:39] statement
[1:52:41] here he says
[1:52:49] he says in I'm just going to just take
[1:52:52] it from there and just close up
[1:52:54] this morning because I want to talk to
[1:52:57] you about
[1:52:59] the purpose of the Capstone
[1:53:05] we're set forth with this great
[1:53:07] requirement
[1:53:09] you're going to stay with me for
[1:53:11] 20 minutes maybe more
[1:53:16] the requirement's been spoken
[1:53:21] he can't change that
[1:53:25] we have to be perfect
[1:53:28] we're not going to enter in
[1:53:31] into that perfect place that perfect
[1:53:35] rest
[1:53:36] with all kinds of carnal algae in US
[1:53:41] it doesn't fit
[1:53:44] God's not a mixer
[1:53:47] is that right so we're we're faced with
[1:53:50] a requirement and we're faced with a
[1:53:54] challenge
[1:53:55] and we're we're faced with coming up
[1:53:59] into this Perfection you can put the
[1:54:02] drawing back up on on there if you would
[1:54:05] just keep the visual
[1:54:07] he said we're faced with this and so we
[1:54:09] come up to all these ages and all these
[1:54:12] Church ages and now there comes a
[1:54:15] Capstone
[1:54:18] and we read in Revelations it says as
[1:54:21] many as I
[1:54:24] love
[1:54:25] I rebuke and I chasten
[1:54:28] so I want you to understand man's come
[1:54:30] up through these Seven Ages
[1:54:33] they're living in the worst age of all
[1:54:35] time
[1:54:38] the most deceptive age of all time
[1:54:43] more things to attack your senses
[1:54:46] more things to attack your imaginations
[1:54:49] to attack you from every angle that
[1:54:52] there is to attack you and and you've
[1:54:55] come up to this place and we build up
[1:54:58] and now we need something to make us
[1:55:03] perfect
[1:55:06] because he said be perfect
[1:55:11] now I want you to take a second with me
[1:55:14] if you would
[1:55:16] to look at the Capstone
[1:55:19] now what love is love is the enforcer of
[1:55:25] the word of God
[1:55:28] 's word is carried out by love
[1:55:32] that's the power by which God does
[1:55:35] everything it was the power by which he
[1:55:38] heals
[1:55:39] did you know that the messenger told us
[1:55:42] that love obligates God to heal it's his
[1:55:46] love for you
[1:55:48] that obligates
[1:55:50] him to heal you
[1:55:52] he heals you because he loves you
[1:55:58] God's
[1:56:02] love is what makes the word God loved us
[1:56:06] in the beginning he wanted to share his
[1:56:08] attributes with us God is love he's the
[1:56:11] fountain everything that God is is done
[1:56:14] because of what that he was
[1:56:17] now the pyramid the Capstone there's one
[1:56:21] thing we know about a pyramid right it
[1:56:23] has three sides
[1:56:29] and so we find out that if I could say
[1:56:32] this that love has three sides
[1:56:39] God's made perfect in threes
[1:56:42] so let me Express this to you and I the
[1:56:46] way that is sort of on my heart
[1:56:49] there's one side
[1:56:53] of love
[1:56:55] is compassion
[1:56:59] Mercy
[1:57:01] long-suffering forgiveness
[1:57:04] comfort
[1:57:06] all those virtues that he has that's one
[1:57:09] side of love
[1:57:13] that's what he has he has compassion for
[1:57:15] you as a sinner he's long-suffering with
[1:57:18] you through your trials in your mistakes
[1:57:22] he's he's
[1:57:23] uh he's merciful to you
[1:57:27] and he sheds his grace upon you he's
[1:57:30] forgiving
[1:57:32] all those parts of him are one side of
[1:57:36] the Capstone
[1:57:38] this side of him that he expresses
[1:57:42] most everybody just likes to view him
[1:57:45] from that one side
[1:57:49] but there's another side of the pyramid
[1:57:52] and that's the side if I could say and
[1:57:56] the scripture says that's the side that
[1:57:59] he instructs you
[1:58:02] he teaches you
[1:58:04] he gives you leadership
[1:58:07] and revelation
[1:58:10] that's the other side of it
[1:58:14] so if he loves you he's going to show
[1:58:17] compassion and mercy and forgiveness but
[1:58:20] if he loves you he's going to instruct
[1:58:22] you
[1:58:23] that's what he said I'll not leave you
[1:58:24] comfortless but I'll come again and I'll
[1:58:26] lead you and guide you and instruct you
[1:58:28] into all righteous and there's another
[1:58:31] side of of love that's instructing
[1:58:36] that that's teaching that's mentoring
[1:58:40] that uh is the word that I like to use
[1:58:44] is tutor
[1:58:46] right isn't that what we're taught
[1:58:48] before we're we're tutored or turned
[1:58:51] over to the father's business and then
[1:58:53] there's another side of it and that site
[1:58:56] is correction
[1:58:59] chastisement
[1:59:00] rebuke
[1:59:02] conviction
[1:59:04] admonishment
[1:59:07] so that's the other side
[1:59:11] of this Capstone
[1:59:13] that that's going to come down
[1:59:16] now the conditions and requirements of
[1:59:19] God hasn't changed
[1:59:24] you understand so here we are in the
[1:59:27] seven Church ages meeting a tremendous
[1:59:31] requirement
[1:59:33] that we've got to meet
[1:59:37] because he can't change his requirement
[1:59:40] we're in an age
[1:59:42] that's God's the worst conditions
[1:59:47] that is even possibly to imagine for a
[1:59:52] person to be a Christian in
[1:59:59] you see where we're at
[2:00:02] we have these requirements that remain
[2:00:04] we have something that God has spoken
[2:00:08] that we would do that we would be
[2:00:10] perfect
[2:00:12] and and now uh let me read this
[2:00:15] statement
[2:00:17] and I'll conclude with this if I can
[2:00:20] find it
[2:00:21] he says
[2:00:24] he makes this statement
[2:00:26] he says this is perfect love
[2:00:30] nothing can enter here without it
[2:00:36] and then he makes this statement also he
[2:00:38] says I'm convinced more than ever in my
[2:00:42] life
[2:00:43] that it will take perfect love to enter
[2:00:47] that place
[2:00:51] perfect love to enter that place
[2:00:55] so
[2:00:57] our idea
[2:01:00] of things
[2:01:02] is that oh boy
[2:01:04] I better get perfect love
[2:01:07] I can't make it there with perfect love
[2:01:10] I better have all these virtues in me
[2:01:15] to Elsa I'm not going to make it I
[2:01:17] better have the Holy Ghost
[2:01:19] else I'm not going to make it all of a
[2:01:22] sudden we put all these requirements on
[2:01:25] us all these things that we're supposed
[2:01:27] to be all these things we're supposed to
[2:01:30] have we're sitting there saying oh my I
[2:01:33] better get virtue Faith knowledge I got
[2:01:35] to be built up he's been growing this
[2:01:37] church all the time because he plans on
[2:01:40] capping it now the object of Love Is Not
[2:01:45] Your Love
[2:01:48] it's his love
[2:01:55] you can do it
[2:01:58] so he says without perfect love
[2:02:02] you will not be there
[2:02:06] if I don't come down
[2:02:11] if I don't come down with my
[2:02:15] three-sided Ministry
[2:02:20] to make you perfect
[2:02:22] and take control
[2:02:24] you will fail
[2:02:29] look he's not leaving us there
[2:02:33] trying to accomplish something that we
[2:02:36] can accomplish he says I'll come down
[2:02:40] I'll enforce the word I will bring it to
[2:02:43] pass I will cap you off I will make you
[2:02:47] complete I will take control
[2:02:53] and that's right we've got to understand
[2:02:55] that when we're coming to this our
[2:02:58] time's running out
[2:03:03] we've got to have divine intervention
[2:03:06] else we will not make the finish line
[2:03:10] the Capstone is the divine intervention
[2:03:13] of God into your life to bring you to
[2:03:16] that perfection
[2:03:20] in other words he's looking at you
[2:03:22] saying son I got to get involved in your
[2:03:25] life
[2:03:29] because if time Runs Out
[2:03:32] in the condition you're in you're in
[2:03:35] trouble
[2:03:37] but I won't leave you
[2:03:40] nor forsake you
[2:03:43] I'll be with you even to the end
[2:03:46] now the purpose of the Capstone
[2:03:49] is to come and take control of the
[2:03:53] believer
[2:03:58] it's the head
[2:04:01] the quality is in
[2:04:03] the statue of the perfect man he comes
[2:04:06] and takes control of the individual's
[2:04:09] life
[2:04:12] you may not be perfect
[2:04:15] but if he takes control of your life
[2:04:17] you'll get perfect
[2:04:22] because he'll instruct you he'll correct
[2:04:25] you he'll still be long-suffering
[2:04:30] he'll still be merciful he'll still be
[2:04:34] kind he'll still be all those things but
[2:04:38] his plan
[2:04:41] work to make you a living Temple of the
[2:04:46] Living God
[2:04:52] you are living idols the terminology he
[2:04:57] used
[2:04:57] living vessels
[2:05:00] of the Living God
[2:05:02] now I look at myself
[2:05:05] and I say my I'm so far away
[2:05:12] how am I going to get there
[2:05:15] how am I going to do it how am I going
[2:05:18] to make it how I'm gonna how am I going
[2:05:21] to overcome
[2:05:23] that's the purpose of the Capstone
[2:05:29] he begins to he comes
[2:05:32] and he enforces the word in your life
[2:05:39] as many as I love
[2:05:43] I rebuke
[2:05:45] and I chasten be zealth therefore and
[2:05:50] repent
[2:05:52] as many as I love
[2:05:59] in this age
[2:06:01] the age of the Capstone as many as I
[2:06:05] love I'm going to bring the Capstone
[2:06:08] down upon their life
[2:06:12] and I'm going to rebuke him
[2:06:15] I'm going to correct them
[2:06:17] I'm going to chastise them I'm going to
[2:06:21] instruct them all at the same time with
[2:06:25] loving merciful hands but the hour so
[2:06:29] late
[2:06:31] that if we don't have divine
[2:06:34] intervention to bring the word of God to
[2:06:38] pass we are going to come up short
[2:06:44] what are we going to do
[2:06:48] I've been in this message 50 years and
[2:06:51] still struggle
[2:06:57] you'll overcome something in five years
[2:07:00] later it's back in your life
[2:07:04] seems like we're up and down in and out
[2:07:06] we have great
[2:07:08] professions of faith we have moments
[2:07:12] that were on the hilltop
[2:07:16] and when we truly look at it we say well
[2:07:19] we talk a lot
[2:07:21] if we play the right kind of music we
[2:07:24] feel spiritual
[2:07:26] but he says this is beyond imagination
[2:07:33] so he said be perfect
[2:07:38] now without perfect love
[2:07:43] we will not be there
[2:07:47] now you can go say I'm going to love
[2:07:50] it's not even in your nature to love
[2:07:58] it something else
[2:08:00] has got to intervene
[2:08:03] to protect
[2:08:06] to protect the church
[2:08:10] something else has got to intervene to
[2:08:14] bring this church
[2:08:16] into
[2:08:18] completion
[2:08:20] end of perfection
[2:08:23] somebody else has to come
[2:08:27] to make the word live
[2:08:30] and make it alive
[2:08:32] we know it we've been instructed we
[2:08:36] understand it but now we're come up to
[2:08:39] all these places
[2:08:40] and in reality we looked at it can we
[2:08:43] say I I want to be a greater Christian
[2:08:46] than I am I want to be better I want to
[2:08:48] overcome it's given to the Overcomer
[2:08:51] when we understand it the Capstone isn't
[2:08:55] a requirement
[2:08:57] that were to possess
[2:09:00] it's him coming to complete his word
[2:09:03] which you are that Capstone is your
[2:09:07] completion not but done by your works
[2:09:10] but done by his love
[2:09:14] that's the perfect love that we won't be
[2:09:18] there
[2:09:19] without
[2:09:21] not that I've meant the requirement of
[2:09:24] perfect love
[2:09:28] I've got perfect love now I can go in
[2:09:31] no
[2:09:32] I can't make it
[2:09:34] if he doesn't cap my life
[2:09:40] I can't make it if he doesn't come and
[2:09:43] enforce the word in my life
[2:09:46] I can't make it the the the purpose of
[2:09:50] the calf zone is to take control and
[2:09:55] enforce the word of God and bring the
[2:09:57] word of pass
[2:10:00] without the Capstone we can't do it
[2:10:03] the purpose of the Capstone is to make
[2:10:05] everything that God prophesied said we
[2:10:08] would be come to pass
[2:10:12] it's him
[2:10:14] taking control
[2:10:18] now you say why do you say that
[2:10:21] it's not you giving
[2:10:24] control
[2:10:30] it's him taking
[2:10:33] control
[2:10:38] this is done by force
[2:10:44] it isn't oh I'm going to let God take
[2:10:46] control of my life how's that been
[2:10:49] working out
[2:10:54] uh
[2:10:55] the purpose of the Capstone
[2:10:58] isn't an anointing
[2:11:02] it isn't a jolly good feeling
[2:11:07] it isn't I've arrived
[2:11:09] it's him looking at the church
[2:11:13] knowing the requirement
[2:11:17] just like when he looked at the church
[2:11:19] at Calvary
[2:11:21] and saw that they needed a sacrifice for
[2:11:25] their sins because they were lost
[2:11:27] he looked at the church world with all
[2:11:31] their effort all their religion all
[2:11:33] their prayer they'll come up short
[2:11:37] because they can't make it without
[2:11:40] perfect love
[2:11:41] not their possession of Love is his love
[2:11:45] the Capstone is his life coming down on
[2:11:49] your life and molding you and making you
[2:11:53] and lining you up
[2:11:58] it's not a crowning achievement of your
[2:12:01] work
[2:12:04] it's him making sure not one of his
[2:12:07] prophecies fail
[2:12:12] he'll take that three the edge of stone
[2:12:16] of instruction
[2:12:18] and mercy and Grace of of of of
[2:12:23] correction
[2:12:25] so I say you better be aware
[2:12:30] don't think it's strange to be corrected
[2:12:35] rejoice
[2:12:37] as many as I love I chastise and rebuke
[2:12:44] we've always been trying to achieve the
[2:12:47] Capstone
[2:12:48] you can achieve the Capstone
[2:12:51] the check stone is the what's going to
[2:12:54] cause the achievement to take place in
[2:12:56] your life it's his work
[2:13:01] that's the purpose of it
[2:13:04] we've been striving
[2:13:09] for something that's we can't get
[2:13:11] without perfect love
[2:13:15] we won't be there
[2:13:19] and I'd like to say this you we've heard
[2:13:20] this and read this many a Time
[2:13:23] but he's talking about the Capstone
[2:13:26] now he says to his own as many as I love
[2:13:30] I rebuke and chasten
[2:13:33] to rebuke is to reprove
[2:13:37] to reprove is to expose with the view of
[2:13:42] Correction
[2:13:45] I don't like to be exposed to you
[2:13:49] I don't like to find out there's
[2:13:51] bitterness in my heart
[2:13:54] or Envy or strife
[2:13:58] but if it's there it's going to be
[2:14:00] exposed
[2:14:03] expose the view to correct
[2:14:07] chasten does not mean
[2:14:11] to punish
[2:14:13] it means to discipline
[2:14:16] because the subjects amendment is in
[2:14:21] mind
[2:14:25] what's the purpose of the Capstone
[2:14:29] to rebuke
[2:14:31] to chasten
[2:14:33] to amend
[2:14:37] with your outcome
[2:14:40] in mind that's right
[2:14:42] he's got an outcome for your life
[2:14:46] man's ignored it for seven Church ages
[2:14:48] put them on the outside of the church
[2:14:51] now he must come down
[2:14:54] in perfect love
[2:14:57] and enforce his word into his elect's
[2:15:01] life
[2:15:03] Hallelujah
[2:15:07] because without that perfect love we
[2:15:09] will not be there not you
[2:15:12] coming up with some artificial imaginary
[2:15:15] love
[2:15:17] no without him
[2:15:19] with the love in his heart
[2:15:22] rebuking and chastising you to bring you
[2:15:26] into Perfection you will not be there
[2:15:30] why did he wait Seven Ages
[2:15:34] he's built this up
[2:15:36] now he's got to come and take control
[2:15:41] he's going to take control
[2:15:45] don't kick against the prick
[2:15:48] get ready for it
[2:15:51] understand it
[2:15:54] it's coming
[2:15:58] he's going to do his work
[2:16:00] he is not going to unfail he's going to
[2:16:03] enforce his word
[2:16:06] no matter what he has to do
[2:16:09] he is going to make you what he said you
[2:16:14] were going to be
[2:16:15] and that is the love of God that does it
[2:16:19] it's the Capstone that does it
[2:16:22] everything that the church was unable to
[2:16:25] accomplish within themselves he
[2:16:28] accomplishes it for them in Divine love
[2:16:36] chest Eisman does not mean to punish it
[2:16:39] means the discipline because the subject
[2:16:43] amendment is in mind that's exactly what
[2:16:47] we find in Hebrews 12 5-11
[2:16:51] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[2:16:55] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[2:17:02] my son
[2:17:03] despised not doubt the chastening of the
[2:17:08] Lord nor feign when thou art rebuked of
[2:17:12] him
[2:17:13] for whom the Lord loveth
[2:17:19] he chastiseth and scourgeth every son
[2:17:24] whom he receiveth
[2:17:27] if ye endure chastisement god dwelleth
[2:17:32] with you as with sons
[2:17:36] and what son is he whom the father
[2:17:40] chastidesth not
[2:17:42] but if ye be without Christ chastisement
[2:17:47] wherefore all are partakers then he are
[2:17:52] bastards and not Sons
[2:17:56] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[2:18:00] flesh with correcteth us
[2:18:03] and we give them reverence
[2:18:06] what shall we not much rather be in
[2:18:11] subjection to the father of spirits
[2:18:14] and live
[2:18:17] for for they vary for a few days
[2:18:20] chastise us
[2:18:22] after their own pleasure
[2:18:25] but he for our
[2:18:29] prophet
[2:18:32] amen that we might be partakers of his
[2:18:35] holiness
[2:18:37] now no chastisement for the present
[2:18:40] seemeth to be joyous
[2:18:43] but Grievous
[2:18:45] never though less afterwards it yield
[2:18:48] this the Peaceable fruits of
[2:18:51] righteousness unto them which are
[2:18:54] exercised there by
[2:18:59] the Capstone
[2:19:02] foreign
[2:19:06] judgment begins at the house of the Lord
[2:19:11] and if it begins with us
[2:19:13] where were the sinner in ungodly stand
[2:19:17] the judgment's coming
[2:19:22] he can't let you go into the judgment
[2:19:27] but he can't change his requirements
[2:19:33] that's what the world does
[2:19:36] everything things change they change the
[2:19:38] requirements they keep changing Society
[2:19:45] we had a marijuana drug problem in our
[2:19:47] country
[2:19:49] which make it legal
[2:19:54] our streets are full of harlots make it
[2:19:56] legal
[2:19:58] I got to be careful I don't use that
[2:20:00] word that banned you from the internet
[2:20:04] Billy's sermon got banned from the
[2:20:06] internet
[2:20:11] tells you something don't it
[2:20:19] he can't change
[2:20:23] you're going to come up
[2:20:27] and and judgment begins here
[2:20:31] so what's he going to do
[2:20:35] he's going to send the Capstone
[2:20:42] he's going to send the Capstone
[2:20:44] down on the church
[2:20:47] he's going to send the enforcer
[2:20:51] he's going to
[2:20:53] take control
[2:20:55] of the body
[2:20:57] to bring it into perfection
[2:21:03] Paul said I become a prisoner
[2:21:07] the purpose of the Capstone isn't reward
[2:21:13] it's a work of love
[2:21:17] that's going to come into the hearts and
[2:21:19] lives of men
[2:21:21] and take control
[2:21:23] for his good pleasure
[2:21:25] go back and read that scripture in
[2:21:28] Hebrews
[2:21:30] Here and Now is set before the love of
[2:21:33] God
[2:21:36] here now is set forth the love of God
[2:21:38] here now is set forth the Capstone
[2:21:43] let me describe the Capstone here here's
[2:21:46] set forth the love of God he desires in
[2:21:49] love a family of his own
[2:21:53] a family of sons like himself
[2:21:59] and therefore before him lies mankind
[2:22:05] as one lump of clay
[2:22:10] out of that same lump he will make some
[2:22:14] vessels unto honor
[2:22:19] yeah and
[2:22:20] under dishonor
[2:22:23] the choosing will be his own choosing
[2:22:27] then those chosen ones born of his
[2:22:30] spirit that will be trained to conform
[2:22:33] to the image of their walk
[2:22:36] he reproves with all long-suffering and
[2:22:40] gentleness and mercy
[2:22:47] he chastens
[2:22:49] with nail scart hands
[2:22:52] and sometimes this Potter must take the
[2:22:55] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[2:22:59] break it down in order that he may
[2:23:02] rebuild it exactly as he desires it
[2:23:07] but it is love
[2:23:10] let me insert
[2:23:13] that is love
[2:23:15] that is the Capstone
[2:23:18] I said the Capstone
[2:23:20] but we know what the Capstone is it's
[2:23:23] love that is love that is his love and
[2:23:27] another way of his love there is not
[2:23:32] there cannot be
[2:23:34] O Little Flock do not fear
[2:23:38] this age is fast closing
[2:23:40] as it does those tares will be bound
[2:23:43] together in a three-fold cord that is
[2:23:47] not easily broken
[2:23:49] they will have a tremendous threefold
[2:23:51] strength of political physical and
[2:23:56] spiritually satanic power
[2:23:58] and they will seek to destroy the bride
[2:24:01] of Christ
[2:24:02] she will suffer but she will endure
[2:24:06] fear not those things that are coming
[2:24:09] upon the Earth
[2:24:11] for he who loved his own loveth them
[2:24:14] unto thee
[2:24:17] end
[2:24:21] it's Capstone time
[2:24:25] it's time for divine intervention
[2:24:28] behold
[2:24:31] I stand at the door and knock
[2:24:36] if you'll open up
[2:24:39] I'll come in
[2:24:41] and sup with you
[2:24:46] it's a three-sided Capstone
[2:24:51] nail scarred hands love and mercy
[2:24:54] chastisement and rebuke
[2:24:58] instruction
[2:25:03] it's time for us to enter in
[2:25:06] individually
[2:25:08] into the ministry of the Capstone
[2:25:12] in our lives
[2:25:15] he's Desiring to cap your life
[2:25:19] or if I could say it this way the
[2:25:21] purpose of him sending the Capstone is
[2:25:24] to force
[2:25:26] and enforce
[2:25:28] and make the word live in you
[2:25:34] and he will make it
[2:25:39] if you fight it
[2:25:42] therefore be zealous
[2:25:45] therefore
[2:25:47] and repent
[2:25:51] it's a great thing that's taking place
[2:25:53] Church
[2:25:55] because he's not going to lose a one of
[2:25:57] us
[2:25:58] he will do whatever it takes that is the
[2:26:04] love of God and the love of God there is
[2:26:07] not there may be a lot wrong with me
[2:26:10] there may be things wrong with you we
[2:26:13] may look at people that have got
[2:26:16] themselves in a very difficult tight
[2:26:19] spot but thank God
[2:26:22] there's a Capstone
[2:26:25] thank God there's a Capstone
[2:26:28] that's finally coming down
[2:26:31] after we've been instructed after we've
[2:26:34] been honed there's a power that's coming
[2:26:36] to make this word come alive if you want
[2:26:41] to study out further go read a little
[2:26:44] more in the message

[2:26:54] church
