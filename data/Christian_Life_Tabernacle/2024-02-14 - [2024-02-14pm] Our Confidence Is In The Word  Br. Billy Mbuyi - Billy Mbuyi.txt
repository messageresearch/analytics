Description:
Our Confidence Is In The Word: The Master's Confidence In His Own Seed
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Christian Life Tabernacle
February 14, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

that will hear it we love you and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so good to be gathered in the house of God want to welcome everyone and amen God bless you let's open our Bibles um in uh Matthew Chapter 13 we're going to 7 let's start from verse the 24th verse it says and another another Parable put it forth unto them saying the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a man which show which saw good seed in his field but while he slept his enemy came and S tear among the wheat and went his way it says but when the blades was sprung up and brought forth fruits then appeared the tears also so the servant of the household came and said unto him sir did thou not sow good seed in thy field from when then had the tear had had it teared he said is said unto them an enemy has done this the servant said unto him will thou then that we go and gather up gather them up but he said unto they he said and he said nay lest while ye gather up the tear ye root up also the wheat he said and then on verse 30 he said uh let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I will say to the reap ERS Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into the barn into my barn father we ask you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats just for a few moment this scripture I'll say has always been one that means so much and to me and um and if if you really look at it in light of the message of the hour the Harvest Time that brother B preach and all those things it really brother bam says the Harvest didn't happen until the end time so you really see uh how this really all comes together I I want to speak in in my in my thought process I'll try not to be too long I'll try to be I I was thinking about this I said you know bham says that Jesus never wasted his word he was very efficient so I said well I want to be very efficient with my word and see how quick I can finish up so and and and my thought as to say tonight uh is our confidence is in the word and as a subtitle I want to say uh the Master's confidence in his own seed as you read there it's it's very apparent as you read that you are the servants concerned about what's going to happen and the situation knowing that the master saw the good seed and and all of the things and come finding the tears around the seed they were very concerned and uh perhaps they were concerned to what's going to happen to the seed perhaps uh this is going to hamper the seed it's going to uh uh uh uh uh cause the seed to go in a state that's not supposed to be or it's going to uh we can even go as far as to say they're going to think it's going to have some negative effect towards the seed and the master is looking at them and saying that I know I said that we have seen this didn't you just saw the good seed but who did this where did the tear come from the master said well he said yeah I know the enemy had done that but he said well so we should go and and take this time and go take out all the tears and and and so that the seed can grow and it would not have anything hindering it they won't have they won't have any challenges around it they will just grow beautiful with the sunshine on its face and no challenges at all the Master look and said no that let's not do that let's leave it all grow together at the end we will know what's going to happen we're going to go and bound up all the tears and do it so I just began to think about it it just on my heart I began to look at it and just to look at the confidence that the master was projecting up on his own seed our pastor's been playing the the the the spoken word is the Original Seed and there's always yeah God comes in the beginning of creation and he said let every seed bring forth after its kind and he puts that statement right up there and he was not concerned so much about what else was going to happen but he was so much in preservation of his own seed that he knew he was going to send God didn't want his seed to be mixed up with anything he didn't want his seed he didn't want he came and he planted uh H H uh to have weed and then something else came up he didn't want the condition where he would come and he will plant corn and something else will come up so therefore he established a law that regardless of what happened the seed will bring forth half its own kind he established a law right up from the beginning and I love it even as our pastor read it and said God said let there be and there was so it doesn't really matter what happens in between it doesn't doesn't matter the challenges that are presented in between all we know is God said it and it's going to come to pass all we know is the master places the seed it doesn't matter how much rain or droughts or whatever happen the master who planted will take care of his own seed and the end the master will reap his own seed that he planted he's not going to plant corn and reap something else when he plants a seed to be corn at the end he will have corn if he planted a seed in the end time to have sons and daughters of God there's not enough devil on Earth that's going to stop it there's not enough conditions on the planet that's going to stop it if you planted sons and daughters in the end time God will reap the same so the master don't want you to become concerned about what else is around you oh the world is falling apart everything is not working and this is happening and politics is happening here the earthquake is going on over there he he doesn't want you to be be concerned about those things the only thing the master wanted to point out was he knew that what he planted on the field was was the real seed that he came and he planted wheat and when the servant was concerned about what else was in the field the master confidence was not in the tears or the other stuff the master confidence was in the fact that there was seed his seed wheat was in the ground and wheat will come out so he wants us to only focus on the seed he wants you to only focus on he want us to only focus on what he planted what he had to do uh you know one you can say he says a certain seed is the other seed is planted everything is there everything else that will come and it it will present as a challenge but the master knew that whatever I planted at the end of the day will produce exactly what I planted now you and I say this because I was thinking many times you find people people they'll come and and they'll say you ask someone why is it that you don't go to church why is it that you're not committed to the things of God they'll find well you know the reason I don't do that is because I have this fleshly failing or or I smoke or I do this or I do that and they let those things hinder them from coming into the presence of God you know even set it on one place he come find one place and said why don't you become a Christian they said well if I stop doing this then I will become a Christian that's the wrong way to approach it that's the wrong way to approach it and because in that condition there is nothing in there that will fight the condition that you are in the devil cannot overcome devil it's just going to be a swap from another devil to another you you cannot overcome evil with evil the Bible says that it's not going to work what you need is for a seed or the word of God to be planted in your heart what you need is to go to a place and hear the word of God believe the word of God let another seed be planted over there the seed of God when it's planted in your heart the seed of God has the way to overcome the tear that's around you the master is concerned on the wheed his concern is not about the tear it doesn't matter how much tear that is in there the seed has the power to overcome all of that and and thought I I thought about it let me just say this I I feel like often time even with our own lives our focus is what we cannot do oh what's wrong the focus is what's wrong with us instead of what's right with us I I just want you to stay with me for a moment every time you w up you don't look at yourself and say man I got a lot of good things going for me I you know often time it's always well you know I didn't do this I failed to do that I was wrong here I was wrong here I was wrong that that's what oh I'm sick in my body and I don't have the job that I'm looking for and all of that that that's okay but let me say this the master focus is the weats that's in you so what you need to do is once you you you look at all of those things there has to be some kind something within your heart that said yes I'm sick but I got god with me so you cannot just focus on the tears that's around you and fail to realize that there's a wheat that was planted in the same field well you know but we'll talk about this the Indian chief he said he had two dogs and imagine if every time that Indian chief walk out walked up the only thing he did he fed the black dog and and tell him how he was you know talk about the black dog every time the white dog will never gain strength and that's often time what we do we work up and he says oh I can't do this I have shortage of this and I wish I could be a better Christian I wish do what let me say this the fact that you are a Christian is already a positive the fact that you woke up you came to the house of God is already a positive the fact that within your heart there's something that bits for the word of God that's already a positive build upon the positive don't pile upon the negative amen amen and let me say this the Master's answer to your condition is let them grow together let them grow together there's we there let it grow together why because the master knew that all it would take is once to Treck him to his possession the tree will have the power to produce what he had to produce there will won't be anything that will challeng it and so so we find out you can say the the he says that seem the master here he's saying we shouldn't be focusing on what we are lacking oh If I Only Could Have This I'll become a better Christian if I only can be this then I will become a better Christian the question should be I have the Holy Ghost God gave me the Holy Ghost and upon this holy ghost that he gave me the scripture says that the Holy Ghost will produce four fruits and those fruits will abound in my life I need to focus on the Holy Ghost that's been given to me I need to focus on the word that's been given to me I need to water that word I need to take care of that word that word will come and it will take away the last of the world it will take away let me say this you didn't come here because there was just wheat in your life you came here because there was just tear in your life you came here because somewhere in your life in your heart there was a weed that was sown also but whatam speaks in the message it shall be and he says this he says now notice this thing this one thing it says paragraph 19 it says for our faith uh it says for your faith that you might that you might have perfect confidence it says for that you might have perfect confidence when you are told anything you stay right there with that don't it says don't you leave it a bit don't you live it a bit of it no matter how she twist and blow you stay right there God promised it God will do it is that right it says this is the gift it says the word will do the word will do it itself now I I want you to people will come through the prayer line will come with all kinds of diseases will come with all kinds of conditions now the prophet is not piling up on how big the disease is he's not piling up on how terrible the conditions are he's coming here and says that you heard the word he's now focusing them from the negative back to the positive did you hear the word he said yes did you believe the word yes did you believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he's the author of this word you believe once he brings them to the positive he knows that the seed word has been planted and if the seed word is planted the seed word will bring forth results it's not the piling up or the tears that changes the circumstance but it's the building on the wheat that's been planted that brings forth the pro the result it says now you are sitting here it says all of you are looking at the at this way it says and listen to the word it said God in heaven knows I do not see a person that I know only there's one thing that does that does know you it says that's God God knows all about you and God can heal you God knows all about the wheat God is not concerned about the tear wanted to bring he's not concerned about how much tear there is that's right in the message the Church of the Church of the Living God he says God is no worth more than his word oh my and and I I said confidence in the word the Master's confidence in his old God is no more worth than his word he says and if his word is no good then he is no good he he says if your word it STS it says if I can't put no confidence in what you say you are no good but you are just as good as your word is and God is just as good as his word is and then it says and I as a Christian believer I believe that this Bible is inspired and it is the WR and it is written by the holy go by the Holy Spirit and it's the unfailing unfailable word of God and God is under obligation to his word to the believer that he will accept his that that that will accept his word he says and any word is the seed and if you accept you accept it in your heart by faith and believe it and confess it God will bring it to pass oh what a marvelous formula and I was just thinking about this and oh I'll probably get to it towards even the hand or say this and and if if I Brother David told me that he was going to give me $50,000 $500,000 and and and and I know let me just and and I hope you understand this $500,000 and I know we know the prophet told us we are not the flesh but the David is not the flesh that's sitting here Brother David is the spirit within the flesh that's why the prophet will say the Holy Spirit what the word the spirit the the Bible tells us that God is a spirit so so the spirit the Holy Ghost wrote the word so when I hear Brother David's word I'm hearing the spirit of Brother David speaking to me and so if he tells me and I show up to cash it Brother David flesh and body his spirit will cause his body to go into motion to come and to take to so that he can obey the words that he told me so that he can bring his promise to come to pass but first the very thing that I know I received from Brother David was his word but the spirit spoke that word into existence and that spirit is responsible to come and take the word that I heard and bring it to pass into my life that's why the prophet will say we have to be be careful when we say spirit it's not another Spirit just some out there the words that's spoken it's got the spirit of God within it to bring it to pass it's not a spirit coming from other places but it's the spirit of the very word that you are hearing why because if God spoke it there has to be a way that's going to bring it to pass and how is he bring it to pass the spirit that brought the word brings the word into manifestation amen wonderful what what I'm says in the message pamus Church age it says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst oh my we we heard the the the word seed of God the word that was spoken in the beginning the word that makes things happen the word that changes circumstances the word that speaks things into existence the word word that calls things that were not as all the were things that are although if they were not the word he said are you sufficiently impressed with that word he says in our M it says let me give you a thought here it says how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we he says every prayer is in Jesus name and there uh it says and isn't that the any answer he says yet I say in John 5 and and 14 he says we are told that but this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he he says he Hearth us this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask him according to his word he will hear us not outside of his word according to his word if you come to the Bible but will say you pick an example that's closest to your circumstance and you take it and you believe it and you take it before God he says if God has ever done something one time he's obligated to do it again if another person shows up in the same circumstance it's the word that does it the spoken word is the Original Seed it says this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he Health us and if we know that he Hearth us whatsoever we ask we know that we have we have a petitions we have the petitions that we desire of him he says now we ask what is the will of God I love this he says there's only one way to know his will that is by the word of God the only way to know his will is even by his own word his word tells you to ask his word tells you what his will is his word tells you everything so he says L it says in lamentation 3 and 37 he says who is he that saith he says it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not he says there it is if it isn't in his word you can't have it so when you can't you can't ask unless it's in the it's in the word we can't petition or ask unless it's in the name it's in his name it says there it is again Jesus the name in the word will he says you can't separate God and the word they are one Hall oh let me just say this he told Joshua be not be not be afraid be confident be confident go forth and and then you shall overcome he said the same way I was with Moses shall I be with you let me say this God told him to be confident because God knew what was awaiting for them before they didn't know what was awaiting for them God knew what army will come before them what army will challenge them on the way God told them he says be confident now let me say this God knew that if they went just as a man with the words of a man they shall fail but God the heaven the creator of Heaven and Earth he gave them his word which is his own seed and he knew knew that if they have a seed in them they shall never fail what we need is the seed of God inside of us when we go to do something we don't need the words of an understanding of a man what you need to ask is am I standing on some seed of God somewhere am I standing on the promises that he said somewhere because if I have the word I have the seed of life I have the seed of overcoming amen amen and I said this before Israel's uh overcoming strength never came based upon how much training they had it's not because they went in they train against the enemy they had the right weapons and they had all kinds of say no that's not where the victory came the victory came by obedience to the words of the Prophet amen when they obeyed the word of the Prophet they overcame when they failed to obey they were defeated so is it with us today we have the words of the prophet in our time our overcoming strength will come from the words of the Prophet how quickly we obey it if he says Don't Be Afraid why are you afraid the word the overcoming seed now we find out that butam will tell us to overcome we need to recognize the devil and every single one of his tricks and then after we do that then we need to also remember and recognize he that is in us that's greater than him that is in the world now the problem is he always the enemy will try to always to get you to forget those tactics butam says this in the revelation of Jesus Christ it says have you ever notice how the devil hates two books in the Bible more than any other it says through the liberal theologians and the SOS sanest and he's always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation in both of these books we find how Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction he says that is why he attacked them he hates to be exposed and then says in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is Jesus said about Satan it says he has no part with me and I have no part in him the devil will like to prove to Pro uh uh the the devil will like to prove that different but he cannot and he doesn't he does all that he can to destroy confidence in the word confidence in the the word confidence in the word what is CH the greatest battle that's ever been fought for human is that we forget that we have a word that's been given to us to overcome with the greatest challenge mankind has ever had is to always forget that in him God placed the material and the deposit that we need in order for us to overcome let let me say this brother the the brother says the word will overcome the challenge of the hour God cannot Place us here so that we can wait for some power from some place to help us overcome the world if he Place us here and he spoke how did we come we came by the word of God so if he Place us here and gave us the message of the hour it's given to us regardless of what challenges we meet that we can use that word to overcome with he says let me just keep some for the sake of time the scripture speaks in Hebrews 10 and 34 it says for ye have for ye had compass for he had compassed of me in my bonds and took my joyfully my joyfully to the spoil and your good and your goods knowing in yourself that ye have in heaven a better a better and enduring substance Cast Away cast not away your confidence therefore cast not away therefore your confidence which he had great recompense of reward for ye have needs of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise that that challenge with men is we we we always seems to think that we need something more than the word after the word has gone forth after we've prayed with us for God and we are in a situation where we don't know how to get out of and we pray we ask for God we we want something else to come and help us no we what we need to understand is we have to have patience with the word of God and know that I I pray God I've asked God and now I'm waiting for him to come and take me out of my situation I'm not waiting for any man I'm waiting for the owner of the word to come and make his word a reality to me oh butam talks about God's confidence in job and and this was not because the prophet will say this was because of job's knowledge of God all job knew was he was given a commandment and he stood by it he was given a word a commandment by which he could live and all job did was he took that commandment and Obey it and he stayed with it day and night and when when something will happen he knew that Jehovah needed a a a burnt offering and he will go the scripture will say that when his children gathered together he said per Adventure they did or said something that's not good will go and offer uh offering and you will do according to he lived his life based on the word that was given to him in his time and then the Devil comes and he's telling God oh it's perhaps because of the the the the things that you have done what the devil was not aware of was job was had the seed of God in him the Commandment the word of God that he had re receive was the seed of God that dwelt within him that's why the seed of the the word will say that who can condemn you of sin if the seed of God remains in you it's the seed that justify you it's the seed that saves you it's a seed that takes you out of sin why what say you cannot fail as long as God in heaven cannot fail no what we take is well the God in us is a has different property than the God in heaven he's no longer the same so when he's Heaven he has more power but the moment he descends in you that power disappears and somehow you need him in the fields in the five senses in order for you to know that he's there God is in his word amen God is in his promise to his children when you have his word you have God in you when you have his seed in you let me say this just as much as you read your Bible every morning or every day you might as well know that you are taking an eating of God inside of you the prophet will say now Satan they said he had come up before God because he could come before God and accused her Christians it says this isn't the message I have heard but now I see preaching 55127 paragraph 51 and and all the time so he accused job of many things and he says job the reason that he could serve God because because anything was come was coming good for him but he said if you if you'll just let me have him in my hand I'll make him curse you to your face he says I I want you to notice that the confidence that God had in a Believer he says in other words God said to Job it says God said to Satan like this he says you can't do it he says I'm just a I'm just I'm just I'm just man Justified he says he is a good man there's not like there's not one like him in the whole earth he says oh what a man that God himself will say to his enemy he says my servant is so perfect there's not another on Earth on earth like him he says oh if we could only be that kind of a man that God could bestow that confidence upon us that we know it says we know will not Twist from his word or his being anyway stay exactly he can put his trust in US amen the trust was based upon job obedience to the word was based upon God knowing that his seed was in job because remember job was the seed of God job was one who received the word of God because the characteristics of the seed of God we'll get to it are the ones that receive the word of God the scripture talks about children of disobedient and children of obedience that's how they are blown they are are brought forth in the further manifestation so if in your heart you love God you you like to hear his word you receive his word in his heart his word in your heart will produce forth after its own kind his word in your heart will bring forth the nature of God out of you it will bring it to the surface and make it manifested whatam will say in the message the Rapture and you will read this scripture um Psalm 27 it says though the whole host encamp about me he says my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I have confidence it says one thing have I desire of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple so David's desire as he writes this but regardless of what was around him regardless of the tears and the situation and all the failings and all the armies that were encamp around him David is sending and saying my confidence in the fact that I know my heart wants to serve the Lord my confidence is in the fact that I know I done wrong yes I I took a wife that was not mine and I killed people and I did all of that but one thing I know within my heart is I want to serve God amen it wasn't this elaborate things like we try to make it he just knew one thing I love God I love his word I want to serve him with all my heart yes I've done wrong but I know there's a seat in there all those stairs didn't matter oh my brother my sister it's when we move our Focus away from all the thars and humbly come to the altar said father I know there's so much tears I couldn't even count them all but I know somewhere within my heart there's a seed that's beating within my heart otherwise I wouldn't be here at this altar otherwise I wouldn't desire to be here I'm not here because somebody brought me here I'm here because within my heart I desire to worship you out of my heart I I desire to be a true Christian out of my heart I desire to see the manifestation of the end time word under of my heart I desire to see you overcome the devil IID like to see you come in our church and comeing to our young people and comeing to and overcome sin and the devil and all things and creating as the nature of God if I don't know anything that's the thing I know that's rightall amen one thing if I desire not 10 one that's right amen and let me say this Faith creates confidence when you have faith you have confidence David knew who he was when he stood before Goliad Oh my he had faith in what the prophet told him the prophet had just baptized anointed him to be a king he said You shall be king of Israel so David stood there there and he this giant tear that was standing in front of him terrifying everybody everybody running away from this giant Terr he looked he says well I know in the natural this is a big tear I can't do anything with that but there's one thing I know I just heard the words of the Prophet oh let me say this I'm not talking about David I'm talking about you I just heard the pro words of a prophet and that Prophet told me that I shall be anointed king that Prophet told me that I'm going to be translated I'm going to be taken out of this body into the new body that Prophet told me that the end time Pride will be the manifestation of Jesus Christ so he came and he looked at the tear in the face he says you have messed up with the army of God I shall cut your head off cut my head off you don't even have a sword I don't know how that's going to happen but I'll cut your head off that's right he spoke the word at the end the word was fulfilled that's what is your giant ha what are you hiding from see our confidence is not in our ability to do things our ability to get things together just the way we want it to have everything just line up then we know God is there no our confidence is I have heard the word of God and I'm standing here just because he said so I'm I'm in the Church of God just because he wanted me to be here I try to run away he caught me and he brought me here he because he opened my ears to understand the Mysteries he opened my heart to accept the Mysteries he done it all and if he done that he's able to take me to my final destination let me move for the second time but I want to makees a statement and I just before I go on let me just read it and and I felt like this is so much part of my problem in the unfailing reality of the Living God bham says Jesus brought God to human lives now I want you to understand that wordings of it if you could put it up if you could find it I didn't write the paragraph down Jesus brought God to human lives God was was made human when Jesus was born God became human that he might become fellowship with men and in men the the challenge we run into is the devil is in the business of making people church members I go to church I pay my tithing I do all of this no different from any other denomination Jesus came to pay for my sin yes he did but that was not the end of it you in your original creation as we heard it from the spoken word is the Original Seed you were made to be a Son of God you were made to be a daughter of God Amen so the coming of Jesus was so he could be the beginner of this new race butam tells us and I want to just take this for a moment he was 100% man and 100% God so he came to show you that within this flesh that a man can be in this flesh and live such a Christian Life that the devil will run away from him he came to be the example example of what God veiled in the human flesh he was the beginning of that race and so if you just take Jesus and leave him on the cross and your sin paid for let me tell you there's a lot more sin that's to come that you're going to do don't leave him at the cross understand that the payment was paid so you can have an entrance into this Kingdom and come into the realization of who you really are Jesus came so you can be God he came he came and he was looking for God's race he didn't die for all people he only died for God's [Applause] race let me just read it let I have fellowship with man and in man it says what achieve one purpose that is to bring to man what God is he didn't say what God was what God is not what the church is but what God is Jesus came that he might present God to men and men didn't want it let me let me just speed up for a little bit paragraph 74 he says the Holy Ghost comes today in like manner to present God to man but man wants to go to church drown his in his own in his thinking he cannot fom it and when it says we must learn that God is not know by intellect intellectual conception God is known by the New Birth the Holy Ghost not by by any other way Jesus the Bible is plainly caught as no man call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost if you never receive the Holy Ghost you don't know what God is what God you don't know what he is in Christ in the in the Christ for that's the only way he reveals himself paragraph 84 Jesus says if you would have known me you would have known my my you would have known my day he came to unite God and man God and man together he came the only one the angel could not have done it none of could have could none none could have done it but him he came to make God and man one don't ever forget that purpose when you think about Jesus Christ that's your entrance to godship that's your entrance into the kingdom of God why he came not all just to pay the sin but he came so you can have the power so you can have the ability to just not be a man but become God hallu 100% man but 100% God but when I'm will say when he came to the tomb of Lazarus he stood there he thought about about his friends his friend and the scripture will say that when he went down to the Galilee to be baptized he went and got his friend and they went down there so he probably taught about all those moments and all of that the the time the good times that they had and the fellowship that they had as a man he caused them to cry he caused them to weep but he said after he' done crying he stood there he says Lazarus come forth amen my brother my sister when things come to you don't just fall in despair it will you will you cry yes you will cry but after you're done crying remember you are a son and a daughter of God stand there and dash yourself up and say I'm a son and a daughter of God I've been placed here for the glory of the Living God I'm not going to cry in despair but I stand here to speak the word to know that God is here to change my circumstance whatever happens to me is for His glory the problem is we only see the tear the desper is so high that's all we see but we fail to see the resurrection that also abides in us I said I was only going to be 15 minutes butam says in unfilling reality of his word paragraph 76 it says now the Holy Ghost will not misbehave itself in one person and behave himself in another it will make each person come through its character not the character of the man the character of the Holy Ghost see because it's the holy spirit that leads you it says it brings makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it it says it makes you subject to its nature the Holy Ghost makes you live and love and do it how many feels like that tonight and then you ask see if you have the Holy Ghost you just lifted your hand when I asked that and then you turn around and you'll say I don't have the Holy Ghost see it's the tactic of the enemy do you love God the thing is don't look at the ter focus on what it's in you that that your desire goes after and put all your energy on it and pour all that you are on it let it grow let it grow until it even overcomes yourself to where you don't know what to do with yourself the only thing I'll say this just play the message play those things and see how in the Good Moods you become you know it doesn't matter what's going on at work and everything how stressful you just play and let the prophet just begin to lay that word down and break down those Mysteries all of the sudden you get closer you're rewinded did I hear that why is it that's your fellowship with him that's the sewing of the seed in the heart but if you run away from it where you going to get it from it's the only thing that will defeat the tear your strength will not do it your good heart will not do it your your emotions are not going to do it the only thing that's going to do it is the word of God so let me say this let's swow the word of God in our heart let it SE if something is going wrong you just keep sowing the word you just keep sowing the word I can't do this right yeah I know but I'm here just sewing the word by the time I'm done sewing the word whatever I was not able to do the word will make me do it let me try to find a place to stop I could just so he says what is it in Oneness it says what is it in paragraph 189 he says what is it you've got to get with the word you got to get with the word get yourself killed out it says I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough Holy Ghost to keep us to make us to get us to a place that we don't want to lie we don't want to uh steal we don't don't want to do anything but God wants to fill us every fiber of his church so the reason for the struggle is not the lack of the Holy Ghost but it's the lack of the fullness of it because yeah you are you're doing the wrong you're not enjoying it you do it and your heart goes oh I can't believe I did I what's doing that something is within your heart is not agreeing with what you're doing so what you need to do is focus on that thing that's telling you this is not okay and feed it more so it goes from just this is not okay to where you have the strength to actually say forget it because if you are enjoying it then what's the use for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is there to give you the power yes that's what the scripture says on the day of Pentecost they receive power but one of them says they had the word but they didn't have the power to operate they what they they had the power they like the faith to operate it so on the day of the Holy Ghost God descended his power so they can take that word and bring it into manifestation so they knew that they had received the seed inside of them so when they went to that get beautiful what they can say Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have received who gave it to them the word gave it to them yes now let me say this but what I'm talks about this the the Satan's plan he says now according to this verse he says when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it's actually a personal experience of the Holy Ghost indwelling in him it says and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom of and the knowledge of God through the word but the depths of Satan will be that he will attempt to destroy this listen to this he will always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of God how will he do it he will he will he will take away the knowledge of the scripture of God destroy the word by putting forth his own an interpretation something that somebody else said something that somebody can explain to you he says had he had God said he will then substitute the personal Christ in our spirit he will do it as he caused as it as he caused Israel to do the same by a human being reigning as King instead of God being born again experience will will be rejected in favor of joining of church joining the depths of Satan has been entered into into in that age it says and the fruits of the depths of Satan which are lies murderous hor horrible crimes came forth from it I think that's why we have to guard against the guard the word in our hearts and guard against excuse me for one second that's why it's important that when when when we we come to church or when we read our Bibles we have to be connected with this message we have connected be connected with this word we can't just sit around and and exchange our own intellect and our own understanding and think we got the word we have to know what is it that God promised for us us what is it that God promised in this age because what Satan will come to do is to try to inject things to cause you to be disbelieve the very word to disbelieve what the original word which you are and it will cause you to believe a substitute which you are not and by believing a substitute you will act according to the substitute the prophet says this in the message The Thirst he says so therefore oh he says therefore no matter how much a church says that anyone else would say if you are born of the spirit of God you become part of the Bible amen if you are born if you are born of the spirit of go God you become part of the Bible paragraph 64 it says it says you you become part of the you become part of the Bible he says God told Ezekiel it says Ezekiel the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other oh my brother my sister is it remind you of anybody John was told to eat the scroll him and the scroll they become part of each other why because when the seed of God is in you it causes you to speak the word to add the word to think the word to to to do everything based on the word it's not longer your own thinking it becomes the word thinking so they become part of each other and that's the Believers when he receives the Holy Ghost the holy ghost that wrote the word the Holy Ghost it says the spirit of God is the word of God the spirit of God is the word of God my words are spirit in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made and and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us Hebrews 13 and8 it says he is the same yesterday today and forever and when you are part of the word oh he says oh he says then let something come up contrary to that word butam he says snaps his fingers there's a little buzzer set off quickly see that's to warn you that death is on its Road it's on the road you should never do that but if the word is not in there all it is is a bunch of explanation then how's the buzzer go off the scripture says we are partakers of divine nature how do we partake the divine nature by this precious promises we become partakers of divine nature what is it that it does it brings us subject to the nature of God we become like God we become in the nature of God that was in us to begin with not that we receive foram says that it's not taking a week and become the Cocker bird it says it was a if a we was a we to begin with it could it could have acted as a bird but if you take it and you take it through to the original it was a weat to begin with but you couldn't change a Cocker bird from a weed or vice versa in the fourth seal it says if the musician could come paragraph 67 the word it the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form and then you see when it's Quicken or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts if you could put it there the four seal um uh paragraph 67 because look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be word that's right and then when the thought is presented its word amen now this is God's thought God is the spirit so his thought is the word his thought when he speaks his thought it becomes the word god thought that he had placed in the word so the word is the thoughts of God being expressed and then when you receive it from him it becomes a word oh my what a place what a blessing it says here is the most evidence set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in his son was by his indwelling Spirit manifesting his word and works it says this is exactly what we have been teaching all along when the bride will get back to being a word bride not just any bride a word word bride the word bride one who has received the word of God she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it is is with the prophet they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them that is how it was with Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him Jesus both he says Jesus both began to do and teach my Doctrine is not my own but the fathers that sent me acts 1 and 1 in John 7 and6 let's all stand so if I want to just encourage us tonight once again oh I don't want you to forget that what is it that's in you though this flesh came as part of the hybrid it's got a lot of things planted in it it's got a lot of things that we inherit for our parents a lot of things we inherit for bad habits and friends that have taught us wrong things and things that we have picked up along the way and where we were hanging at but there's one thing that works for you that within that that that flesh God has planted his own seed so tonight if I could say anything I don't want you to take all your focus and continue to worry about the things you cannot do continue to focus on the what's wrong with you oh I can't talk right I can't think right I can't do this right let me tell you as long as you are in this V there's always going to be something that you can't do right but oh there's something that if you put all your energy to it if you put all your focus to it it will change your life forever there's one thing that if you will believe it if you'll pour all that you have on it if you will let it grow if you will let those things which you cannot do it will bring it to pass one by one it will bring it in manifestation why because the word our pastor read the other time he said the word is the only seed of life amen it's the only seed of eternal life if you want to receive the eternal life receive the word but Ram says but R I'm told us he says if you want deity in your mids it says receive the word of God you want change in your life tonight receive the word of God there's things that are not going okay there's things that you want to change there's things that you want to see happen there is in your life you want the Holy Ghost receive the word if you receive the word you will now have the seed and therefore you have the right for that seed to come into manifestation in your life when you have received the seed you have the right to the fruit why because every seed will bring forth of its kind but if you don't have the seed you can't have the fruits of it by receiving the seed you allow for the fruits to come in to manifestation our gracious father we're so thankful for your word Lord father you are so awesome tonight Lord and want to just lift your NEP up on high and Lord your Prophet will say that we are needy people and surely we are if we go through every row every person sitting here and we ask do you have need of something no doubt the end will be uplifted but Lord we also want to focus on something to know that within us dwell the Living God the seed of God and it's the seed of God in us that will produce the things which we have need of Lord if we don't have that seed we invite by that word of God that is been preached tonight may we receive that seed of God inside of our Lives Lord Lord so he will help us overcome the testing and the things which we are facing every day it will help us live a life that's pleasing to you Lord oh God your scripture says that your word maketh an entrance to us an entrance shall be Minister unto you into the Everlasting kingdom of God the entrance is ministered by the word of God lord we take your word and we place it in our hearts and we ask that you may just help us Lord in our weakness tonight father make us strong oh God where we are weak Lord let the word be our strength what we cannot do let the word help us do it father what you have asked of us that we faing short let your word bring us to a place where we can do it Lord we commit everything we are Lord and every uplifted hand any need in the body Lord tonight we ask father that you go and minister to each one Lord we commit what we are to you Lord we love you with all our heart hearts and we ask the things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen oh Jesus being the Lord of all oh and Jesus be the Lord of all oh and Jesus [Music] [Music] thees Jesus Son Sur Jesus surrender all oh my heart Jesus is the Lord of all Jesus is the Lord yes Lord Jesus Jesus is the Lord of all Jesus is the Lord of all the king let's sing that one more time

cast oh mercy oh do you love him tonight can you identify with his mercy upon your life oh I was I was just thinking well brother Billy was preaching the image came to my heart how this seed this wheat seed when it's tested when it's tried you know what it does it it becomes flower right because of the trials of life and all the things that come upon you and then God comes and Waters this flower this this wheat that has been crushed by life the life of Jesus Christ the overcoming power and becomes bread and now we dwell in the place called Bethlehem the house of God's bread that inner man that that that holies of holies because there was a wheat that was sent that was original that he planted it was his own he knew them by name and he sent his word to be able to bring them to a maturity so he can gather them all together oh I don't know but that's Mercy cuz I was lost one day I really was and there was Mother Eagle that word that was looking for me and didn't let me sit in
