[38:03] it's not going to be good. So, please
[38:04] make sure you register. And, and I want
[38:06] to just say this. I I don't know about
[38:09] you, but I'm expecting the Lord to do
[38:10] something. I I don't believe these
[38:12] meetings are just held so we can say we
[38:14] also have uh meetings but I believe uh
[38:18] as the Bible the prophet will tell us if
[38:20] we come expecting that the lord will
[38:22] meet our expectation we we live in such
[38:25] a time where our expectation has to be
[38:28] unlimited
[38:30] our expectation is for the new body is
[38:32] for rapture is for all of that so we we
[38:35] want to come to these meetings and and
[38:38] be expecting and be prayerful that the
[38:40] Lord will inspire the minister, the
[38:43] preacher, so you can receive from
[38:45] directly from God something that he has
[38:48] for you. And not just the meeting, even
[38:49] this morning. That has to be our
[38:52] attitude every time we walk in the
[38:53] building. Lord, I'm I'm here expecting
[38:56] for you to speak to me. And I think
[38:58] that's when we'll see him move in such a
[39:00] way that we'll never that will just pass
[39:03] the even the understanding of man. Amen.
[39:08] Um so let's do that. Um there will be a
[39:11] a a choir practice in uh uh after the
[39:15] youth choir practice in the sanctuary
[39:17] after that. The west just want to tune
[39:19] up everything and and make sure they're
[39:21] ready for that. We want to remember
[39:23] sister Heidi u you know sister Heidi
[39:26] Thomas lost her dad and pray that the
[39:28] Lord will be with the Thomas family.
[39:30] Brother George lost his father. We want
[39:32] to remember them this morning. Pray that
[39:34] the Lord will comfort them and and it
[39:36] will be the portion. Uh, Sister Melinda
[39:39] writes, "Please pray uh, please be in
[39:41] prayer for my mother. Uh, she will be
[39:44] having a surgery to remove her a
[39:46] gallbladder on Wednesday. We pray that
[39:48] the Lord will certainly uh, guide the
[39:50] whole process and be with the surgeon's
[39:52] hand. Men can only do what men can do,
[39:55] but it's God who provides the result
[39:57] when it's all said and done." Brother
[39:59] John Enchans writes up says, "Please
[40:01] pray for my mom as she was discharged
[40:03] from the hospital. The doctor says that
[40:06] uh there's no hope
[40:08] that she should go in the hospice and we
[40:11] need this time to minister Jesus word to
[40:13] her and and we are praying for clarity
[40:17] in their mind and we just want to
[40:20] remember the family at this time. I I
[40:23] tell you our God there's nothing
[40:24] impossible for him and and I want to say
[40:26] this even the things that comes to us he
[40:29] still knows about it. He allows those
[40:31] things so we can come closer to him and
[40:33] come asking and say, "Father, we have
[40:35] this needs upon our hearts." And amen. I
[40:37] want to say if you're sick this morning,
[40:39] if you have a need upon your heart, just
[40:41] lift your hand up to him this morning.
[40:42] Say, "Father, remember me this morning.
[40:45] Don't pass me by this morning. Just come
[40:47] by my way." When the the pastor comes
[40:50] and he's ministering the word, Lord,
[40:52] remember me this morning. I I and if
[40:55] though that's you all you can do. You
[40:57] have broken gravity and God sees your
[41:00] hand and he knows your need and he will
[41:02] do it this morning. The brothers that
[41:04] are taking the offerings, if you could
[41:05] come, brother Abel, if you could just
[41:07] come and take this needs before the
[41:09] church. Amen.

[56:13] &gt;&gt; Our gracious father,
[56:17] what's this building?
[56:19] [Music]
[56:21] What's this people?
[56:26] What's this city in this town? in this
[56:29] world, in this country, Lord,
[56:32] it's nothing
[56:34] without you.
[56:37] What's our life but a space of time
[56:40] that's forgotten and put into the ground
[56:43] and maybe a wood marker on top saying
[56:50] this person lived from such and such
[56:53] time to such and such time
[56:57] forgotten.
[57:01] But Lord with you
[57:03] life is everything.
[57:08] Father,
[57:11] as our sister sung, the way forward is
[57:16] back.
[57:18] Lord, we want to come back
[57:24] to where our lives are nothing without
[57:28] you.
[57:30] Guide us there. We pray by your holy
[57:35] spirit and by your word. Let us find our
[57:40] way back. Father, I ask that you would
[57:43] bless this in Jesus precious name we
[57:47] pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[57:50] seated this morning.
[57:53] Certainly always nice to be in the house
[57:58] of the Lord. Thank you musicians and and
[58:02] appreciate that. This is what the
[58:06] prophet of God said in the way of a true
[58:09] prophet.
[58:11] He says, "Oh, how we need today a call
[58:16] back to the word of the Lord."
[58:20] Look, today our nich nation needs a call
[58:25] back.
[58:26] And as the Lord's been dealing with our
[58:28] heart, we understand
[58:31] that in order to go forward, we got to
[58:35] go back. And we're going to continue on
[58:38] that thought this morning. We're going
[58:40] to play a portion out of the message in
[58:44] his presence. But I'd like to I have to
[58:48] make a few announcements this morning.
[58:50] Um uh if you would bear with me and and
[58:55] then uh we'll uh play our portion of our
[58:59] tape. Uh
[59:01] um so uh we we want uh to
[59:08] realize that we do have the meetings
[59:10] coming up. Uh brother Jason and Matt
[59:13] Watkins will be with us. I'm excited
[59:15] about that. uh for our youth. Uh and we
[59:20] certainly want to uh
[59:23] uh get registered to make it easier on
[59:27] everybody, but because of our
[59:30] preparation for that, the fellowship
[59:34] hall is going to be closed uh until next
[59:39] weekend. So, uh, if you have to feed
[59:42] your, uh, baby or something, maybe take
[59:45] them to your car or, um, uh, or you
[59:50] know, if you use one of the rooms then,
[59:53] but just don't go over into the
[59:55] fellowship area cuz we're decorating
[59:58] there. But the only meeting we're going
[1:00:01] to have over there is after service uh
[1:00:05] today after our baptism. Uh we're going
[1:00:09] to meet with uh brother Tim and I are
[1:00:11] going to meet with the Sunday school
[1:00:14] teachers and uh start finding out what
[1:00:17] we need. So we have a meeting for our
[1:00:19] Sunday school. I believe our Sunday
[1:00:21] school starts the the weekend after next
[1:00:24] weekend. And so we would love to have
[1:00:29] you let us know if you're going to have
[1:00:31] your children there
[1:00:35] uh so we can figure out how many
[1:00:38] classrooms we have to have and how many
[1:00:42] uh children. So if you can make it
[1:00:44] easier on us, you know, everybody gives
[1:00:47] these um all this effort, you know, um
[1:00:52] and you know, none of the deacons get
[1:00:54] paid, you know, the Sunday school
[1:00:57] superintendent. I think it his salary is
[1:01:00] about negative3 or $400 every year. You
[1:01:05] know what he puts in out of his pocket.
[1:01:08] Sunday school teachers just give their
[1:01:10] time and effort, but it's for the kids.
[1:01:15] And so, if you'd help what you can do to
[1:01:17] help us, it'd be uh wonderful. And you
[1:01:23] know, as we're we're growing, uh we're
[1:01:27] we all we've been growing and we're
[1:01:29] grateful for that. Uh and you know, we
[1:01:33] have new families uh coming all the
[1:01:36] time. In fact, uh, Brother Sergiro and
[1:01:39] Sister Carla Hernandez have come to join
[1:01:42] us and their four children from El Paso.
[1:01:46] I don't know if they're here this
[1:01:47] morning or not. Oh, yeah. Why don't you
[1:01:49] stand up? So, out of here,
[1:01:53] Amen. God bless you. Brother Sergio,
[1:01:56] Sister Carla, uh, Brother Sergio was a
[1:02:01] desire on his heart to spread the gospel
[1:02:03] and and to preach for doors open for him
[1:02:06] and and we appreciate that. So I I don't
[1:02:10] know if the kids are here. They didn't
[1:02:12] stand up with you.
[1:02:15] Where are you?
[1:02:17] Stand up.
[1:02:20] All right.
[1:02:24] Oh, there they are back there.
[1:02:28] You know, I uh I tried not to identify
[1:02:31] with my parents when I grew up, too. So,
[1:02:34] no, we we we certainly appreciate that.
[1:02:38] um
[1:02:41] at you know as we are uh
[1:02:46] um we've only been in the church a
[1:02:48] couple years and uh we're finding that
[1:02:51] there's certain things that are
[1:02:53] necessary
[1:02:55] uh for us to do to have order
[1:02:59] and to u
[1:03:02] and to uh be able to accommodate.
[1:03:06] and uh we we still haven't learned to be
[1:03:09] on time for church. So, uh that's always
[1:03:13] been difficult, but
[1:03:16] uh we're we're going to try to uh
[1:03:20] develop, if I could say, a seating
[1:03:23] pattern. So, um that would help us as we
[1:03:28] seat people. So, I I'd like just to uh
[1:03:33] uh so you know what we what we're trying
[1:03:36] to do is try to make things this the
[1:03:39] best and the most uh orderly as
[1:03:43] possible. We don't want to be
[1:03:45] legalistic, but we want to be able to do
[1:03:48] things decently and in order. So, if you
[1:03:51] understand, so what what we're trying to
[1:03:54] do is have some seating guidelines.
[1:03:58] Okay?
[1:03:59] And uh and uh so uh I we got kind of
[1:04:05] some categories here. So if you're young
[1:04:10] and an unmarried individual
[1:04:13] now you apply that the definition to
[1:04:17] yourself.
[1:04:19] Okay. But we want the young and married
[1:04:22] unindividuals to try to if they can seat
[1:04:26] in the first four rows, you know. So we
[1:04:30] have that for the the young and um
[1:04:36] and unmarried.
[1:04:39] Okay. So we'll do that. And I and I I
[1:04:43] know this isn't maybe fair, but we're
[1:04:47] just trying to do this to see how it
[1:04:51] works. Now, if there's total rebellion,
[1:04:55] then we'll figure something else out.
[1:04:58] You know how that goes. Cuz you're not
[1:05:00] going to make everybody happy. But
[1:05:02] anyway, we're so we're trying to get the
[1:05:04] the teenagers off the back row and get
[1:05:07] them up front, you know. So anyway,
[1:05:11] and then if you're you're married
[1:05:14] couples
[1:05:15] uh without small babies, then maybe you
[1:05:19] could sit in the middle of the church
[1:05:22] somewhere
[1:05:24] uh in the rows 5 through 8. Now, we're
[1:05:28] not going to number the rows, but it's
[1:05:30] just how it is. Uh you know, I'm subject
[1:05:34] to the deacons. I didn't know if you
[1:05:35] knew that or not. And then families with
[1:05:38] young children, you you'd sit in the
[1:05:41] next part of the church like through
[1:05:43] nine and 10. And then um
[1:05:48] and then so then we'll try to save the
[1:05:50] the back rows for like the small babies
[1:05:53] that where the mothers have to go out.
[1:05:57] But here's the good thing,
[1:06:01] and this is how it's written. Our
[1:06:03] precious elders are welcome to sit
[1:06:07] wherever they are most comfortable.
[1:06:11] If you need assistance, please let the
[1:06:14] deacons know and we are here to serve
[1:06:17] you. So
[1:06:20] Jerome
[1:06:23] where whatever category you want to put
[1:06:26] yourself in, young, old, senior, you
[1:06:30] know what I mean? uh feel free and uh
[1:06:34] you know uh so um
[1:06:38] you know so that's how it is. So we
[1:06:40] we'll try it. Uh if you come in late and
[1:06:44] uh you're a young person, they'll
[1:06:46] probably just escort you on up to the
[1:06:49] front and fill in the spots and and all
[1:06:53] those things. So uh we want to know
[1:06:56] that. So just uh try to stay out the
[1:06:59] best you can out of the uh uh the room
[1:07:03] over here. We will have our Sunday
[1:07:05] school meeting. And then another
[1:07:08] housekeeping issue
[1:07:10] um and uh it is um you know we know that
[1:07:17] sometimes our babies have accidents
[1:07:20] and we understand that but
[1:07:23] uh if your child has an accident on the
[1:07:26] pews, would you immediately clean it up?
[1:07:30] um if you could do that. Um now if you
[1:07:35] can't afford diapers or you didn't bring
[1:07:37] extra diapers, let us know. Uh we'll
[1:07:40] provide that for you.
[1:07:43] But what's happening is some of the
[1:07:45] children are um you know, do I need to
[1:07:50] get more descriptive?
[1:07:52] You got the picture. Okay. So we need to
[1:07:56] keep it clean. There's nothing more like
[1:07:59] a surprise when our sisters are cleaning
[1:08:02] and they come down and all of a sudden
[1:08:04] there's a real some type of thing going
[1:08:07] on there. So, um, enough said
[1:08:12] on that.
[1:08:14] We're good. Okay. All righty. Um,
[1:08:20] we made mention
[1:08:23] last week and um,
[1:08:27] and I want to explain it a little deeper
[1:08:30] to you about
[1:08:32] um, and I hope I didn't come across
[1:08:36] being upset and and I I appreciate the
[1:08:41] fact that you love me and and if we
[1:08:44] preach a sermon that you're appreciative
[1:08:47] of that and I know that uh we applaud
[1:08:52] for specials and that's the time and
[1:08:56] place
[1:08:57] to do it
[1:09:00] but after the preaching of the word
[1:09:04] um
[1:09:06] we ask not
[1:09:09] to applaud for a reason
[1:09:13] and
[1:09:14] the
[1:09:16] um when the word's preached if you would
[1:09:20] um
[1:09:22] you know understand the whole purpose of
[1:09:25] the gospel this is a house of correction
[1:09:28] you understand that we come here to hear
[1:09:32] the word of God we don't come here for
[1:09:36] the minister to correct us or the
[1:09:39] minister to point out fault
[1:09:43] uh you know I do have a few hobby horses
[1:09:46] I get on every now and then and you just
[1:09:49] have to bear with me uh through those.
[1:09:53] But the the idea is that you hear the
[1:09:55] word of the Lord and the Holy Spirit
[1:09:58] deals with your heart
[1:10:01] and you want to keep that atmosphere.
[1:10:05] Uh I was fellowshipping with brother
[1:10:08] Joan and he he put it in such beautiful
[1:10:13] uh terminology. He said we need to
[1:10:15] marinate
[1:10:17] in in the in the word, you know, and
[1:10:22] when you marinate something is is you
[1:10:24] let it soak in till the flavor of it
[1:10:29] comes into it. And that's what we want.
[1:10:32] We want the spirit of God to soak in to
[1:10:36] us
[1:10:37] until we uh it becomes a part of our
[1:10:42] lives. And the Holy Spirit's very timid
[1:10:47] and he's he's looking for a place to
[1:10:51] rest.
[1:10:52] And our our messenger taught us that
[1:10:54] he's looking for a hungry heart,
[1:10:57] something to rest. And um we want to
[1:11:03] work towards that atmosphere.
[1:11:06] And a as I think when we listen to this
[1:11:10] portion, it's just 24 minutes. When we
[1:11:12] listen this this morning and we'll make
[1:11:15] a few comments, you'll understand
[1:11:19] uh the direction
[1:11:23] that is on my heart. The Lord started
[1:11:26] dealing with me the end of last year
[1:11:29] here just recently
[1:11:31] about where do we go from here?
[1:11:35] Uh what's our path forward?
[1:11:38] What's next for the church? you know,
[1:11:42] uh, we've been through doctrine and
[1:11:44] doctrine and doctrine, but I think the
[1:11:46] most important thing is that we should
[1:11:49] be able to take what we have and bring
[1:11:52] it out to the world as a burning light.
[1:11:59] And
[1:12:01] we
[1:12:02] need to be more sensitive
[1:12:06] to the moving of the Holy Spirit. We
[1:12:09] don't want to produce
[1:12:12] wool. We want to bear it. We want our
[1:12:16] lives to
[1:12:18] just for God to be able to deal with us.
[1:12:21] And we want to be extremely sensitive
[1:12:26] to him. And that's what our heart's
[1:12:29] desire is to de to bring his presence
[1:12:34] into our midst that he can deal with us
[1:12:39] as a body and as individuals
[1:12:43] and that we can have leadership in our
[1:12:46] lives. Very important that the spirit of
[1:12:49] God is leading you in your life. And so
[1:12:55] we want to play this message
[1:12:59] in his presence
[1:13:01] and we hope that we'll play pro portion
[1:13:04] tonight uh rest some of it this evening
[1:13:08] also but I want you to listen as brother
[1:13:11] Bram explains the effect of God's
[1:13:16] presence
[1:13:18] and so and then we'll make us a few
[1:13:21] comments on it afterwards. words. So, uh
[1:13:25] we're the he he's going to read um out
[1:13:30] of the book uh uh uh here uh out out.
[1:13:37] It's out of the uh book of uh let me see
[1:13:41] here. I had it wrote down. I um it's
[1:13:46] Isaiah the I believe the sixth chapter.
[1:13:50] and and we'll we'll read there uh the
[1:13:53] sixth chapter of Isaiah and uh and we'll
[1:13:58] we'll the prophet of God's going to read
[1:14:01] the scripture. We'll use that as our
[1:14:03] scripture reading. Then we'll listen to
[1:14:05] these next few moments and and just
[1:14:08] listen. It's very easy listening.
[1:14:12] But but understand what that he's
[1:14:14] pointing out.
[1:14:16] You understand? He's pointing out the
[1:14:19] effect of the presence of God.
[1:14:23] You understand? So he's making a great
[1:14:26] distinction and he wants us to
[1:14:29] understand the distinction of the
[1:14:31] presence of God and what the presence of
[1:14:34] God does. And then when you see
[1:14:39] certain responses
[1:14:42] to what people think is the spirit or
[1:14:46] the presence of God, then you can see
[1:14:49] there's a contrast.
[1:14:51] And you'll find out that all these
[1:14:54] people that he's talking about that came
[1:14:56] into the presence of God all felt like
[1:14:59] they were dead men.
[1:15:02] You know what I mean? Now, our idea
[1:15:04] today of coming into the presence of God
[1:15:07] is running around and and doing all
[1:15:10] that. And he wants to make a distinction
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; because when God is present,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; things happen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Good things happen. Yes,
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; prophet of God told several of my
[1:15:29] friends and brother Billy Paul shared it
[1:15:32] with me, brother Ed Biscll shared it
[1:15:34] with me, Barroy Border shared it with
[1:15:36] me. Uh many of the people that uh
[1:15:40] brother Robersonson they said whenever
[1:15:43] brother Brandham was around good things
[1:15:48] happened
[1:15:52] because he brought that presence of the
[1:15:55] Lord. I remember brother Hickerson
[1:16:00] talking about I think brother Brenham
[1:16:02] gave him a fishing pole or something to
[1:16:06] go fishing with. He said he caught fish
[1:16:08] a mile high. He ran back down there and
[1:16:11] brought somebody else. They didn't catch
[1:16:13] a thing, you know. So, we want to become
[1:16:16] sensitive to that. We also want to
[1:16:20] understand that we have a guide. Do you
[1:16:25] understand God sent us a message to
[1:16:29] guide us through this hour that we're
[1:16:32] in? the most evil, the most wicked, the
[1:16:36] most deceptive age, more temptations,
[1:16:40] more spirits to draw us off, more
[1:16:43] candalization to the flesh and to the
[1:16:46] mind, and and we've got to be able to
[1:16:50] build up a resistance
[1:16:53] to the things of the world and return
[1:16:56] back to the world. We listened last week
[1:17:00] where prosperity is not a measure of
[1:17:04] God's presence and we and and the church
[1:17:09] is drifting that way. Numbers is not a
[1:17:15] measure of success or God's presence.
[1:17:19] The only measure of the spirit of God as
[1:17:24] our our messenger said was the deviation
[1:17:29] from the word of God.
[1:17:31] That's how you tell something is how
[1:17:34] does it deviate
[1:17:36] from the word of God. And in my own
[1:17:40] personal heart,
[1:17:43] there just seems to be such a drift
[1:17:48] away from the absoluteness
[1:17:52] of the messenger and trying to separate
[1:17:55] the messenger from the message and
[1:17:58] trying to separate the move of the Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit from the word of God.
[1:18:04] And uh we've got to come back to that,
[1:18:09] back to our ABCs, back to our
[1:18:12] fundamental holiness, back to what true
[1:18:17] spirituality
[1:18:19] is. And
[1:18:22] um
[1:18:25] to me I feel that's my responsibility of
[1:18:28] of of whatever influence I have in an
[1:18:32] hour or so on a Sunday morning is uh
[1:18:37] what direction are we going to and I
[1:18:41] don't want to go forward without the
[1:18:43] guide. So I hope you understand that.
[1:18:47] So, uh, it wasn't that I didn't
[1:18:49] appreciate the hand clapping. It w the
[1:18:52] applause. Uh, everybody likes to hear
[1:18:55] they did good. I I, you know, I I know
[1:18:59] understand that you it's your way of
[1:19:01] saying that it's a great sermon. I
[1:19:02] really enjoyed it. But that's not the
[1:19:05] point of the sermon.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; You understand that's not the result.
[1:19:11] I I'm not preaching for that result. Is
[1:19:15] you understand that? So when I get that
[1:19:18] result, it makes me feel like I didn't
[1:19:22] accomplish what I was preaching
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; for.
[1:19:27] Is it you you understand that? So we're
[1:19:31] we're we all want the same thing here,
[1:19:33] don't we? Isn't our goal to try to make
[1:19:37] the rapture? Are are we all here for
[1:19:40] that?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, we don't want to be left behind.
[1:19:43] And and and I know young people you go
[1:19:46] through different things in life. It's a
[1:19:48] very difficult time of life. But that
[1:19:52] you know we want you to understand that
[1:19:55] the world is not your friend.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; They're they have it doesn't intend for
[1:20:06] you to live forever. Their goal is to
[1:20:10] destroy your life, destroy your mind,
[1:20:14] destroy your spirit, and take you to
[1:20:16] hell,
[1:20:19] you know, and and and
[1:20:23] we we don't want that for you. We don't
[1:20:26] want you to
[1:20:29] do a temporary career or a temporary
[1:20:34] fantasy relationship or get involved
[1:20:37] with a boy or a girl and have your life
[1:20:40] scarred and then you have to battle
[1:20:42] battle mental battles all your life and
[1:20:44] then you get to the place that you you
[1:20:47] know you you you have to suffer for
[1:20:50] those things. You know, we want to get
[1:20:53] you back if you've been that road. We
[1:20:55] want to get you back to the peace and
[1:20:58] the love of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:21:01] We want us to res as a body of believers
[1:21:06] to understand the importance of being
[1:21:09] born again
[1:21:11] of recognizing the world and the things
[1:21:14] of the world and having the spirit of
[1:21:17] God come into your life, forgive you of
[1:21:21] your trespasses, and fill and lead your
[1:21:25] life. Those are some of the basic things
[1:21:28] that we've got to project. And and if if
[1:21:32] I've uh
[1:21:35] and like any minister, we've been down
[1:21:38] the roads of mysteries. We've been back
[1:21:40] to the things. But nothing happens
[1:21:43] without the presence of God. though if
[1:21:46] you would uh bear with me and my folly
[1:21:50] if you would say that and and listen for
[1:21:53] the next 20 minutes to a man whom I
[1:21:58] believe was the fulfillment
[1:22:02] of the promised
[1:22:05] message of this age. The fulfillment of
[1:22:08] Malachi 4:5. Behold, I'll send you
[1:22:12] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:22:14] dreadful day of the Lord. The
[1:22:16] fulfillment
[1:22:18] of Luke 17:30.
[1:22:21] In the days as it was in the days of
[1:22:24] Noah,
[1:22:25] as it was in the days of Sodom, so shall
[1:22:28] it be in the day of the revealing of the
[1:22:31] son of man. and also Revelations 10:7,
[1:22:36] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:22:38] angel, the mysteries of God should be
[1:22:42] finished. So to me, this was a man that
[1:22:45] was born, created, and sent to fulfill
[1:22:50] scripture and to give a message
[1:22:55] to this generation.
[1:22:58] And that message is not to be handled by
[1:23:01] man. It's to be left alone just the way
[1:23:06] God brought it. And he brought it in
[1:23:10] such a manner that it would speak to
[1:23:14] every predestinated heart.
[1:23:19] It doesn't need explaining. The Holy
[1:23:22] Spirit will convict you and speak to you
[1:23:26] and deal with you from the word of God.
[1:23:29] So, let's just listen and we'll have a
[1:23:31] few comments at the end and uh and and
[1:23:35] we appreciate and love you. So, um let
[1:23:39] let's just try to go forward. Let's clap
[1:23:42] for the uh specials and after the
[1:23:47] preaching, let's marinate.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Sound good? God bless you. This is your
[1:23:53] messenger trying to guide you to the
[1:23:57] kingdom.
[1:24:00] And now tonight, God willing, we're
[1:24:03] speaking on the subject of in his
[1:24:05] presence.
[1:24:07] Oh, how we thank God for the privilege
[1:24:10] that we can come into his presence. But
[1:24:12] first, I wish you all to turn in your
[1:24:14] Bibles with me to the prophet Isaiah,
[1:24:19] the sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah.
[1:24:23] We all know that Isaiah was a major
[1:24:25] prophet and one of the great prophets of
[1:24:29] his day. He ended his life by being saw
[1:24:33] a sunder with Sauls
[1:24:35] for a testimony as a martyr to the power
[1:24:38] of almighty God. In the book of Isaiah
[1:24:42] the sixth chapter, I begin at the fifth
[1:24:45] verse to read.
[1:24:49] Then said I, woe is me. Or maybe I start
[1:24:55] with the first verse. Let's pardon me a
[1:24:57] moment. Let's start at the first verse
[1:24:59] and read down to about the eth verse. In
[1:25:02] the year the king
[1:25:05] died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:25:09] throne. High and lifted up.
[1:25:13] In his train filled the temple. Above it
[1:25:17] stood the serapens,
[1:25:19] each one having six wings.
[1:25:23] With twain he covered his face,
[1:25:26] and with twain he covered his feet, and
[1:25:29] with twain he did fly,
[1:25:32] and one cried unto another, and said,
[1:25:36] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of
[1:25:41] hosts, and the whole earth is full of
[1:25:44] his glory.
[1:25:47] And the post of the door moved at the
[1:25:50] voice of him that cried, and the house
[1:25:54] was filled with smoke.
[1:25:56] Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am
[1:26:01] undone, because I am a man of unclean
[1:26:04] lips, and I dwell in the midst of people
[1:26:08] of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen
[1:26:11] the King, the Lord of Hosts.
[1:26:15] Then flew one of the seraraphim unto me
[1:26:19] having a live coal in his hand, which he
[1:26:22] had taken with the thongs from off the
[1:26:25] altar. and he laid it up on my mouth and
[1:26:29] said, "Lord, this has touched thy lips,
[1:26:34] and thine iniquity
[1:26:36] is taken away, and thy sin is purged."
[1:26:40] Also, I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:26:43] saying, "Who shall I send and who will
[1:26:46] go for us?" Then said I, "Here I am.
[1:26:52] Send me."
[1:26:55] May the Lord bless his word.
[1:26:58] I think that's the most striking
[1:27:02] scripture.
[1:27:05] We find
[1:27:07] that in the presence of God,
[1:27:11] men recognize themselves to be sinners.
[1:27:16] We may feel pretty good when we're out
[1:27:19] different places and feel like that
[1:27:21] we're pretty good people.
[1:27:23] But when we ever come into the presence
[1:27:25] of God, then we see how little we are.
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Standing not long ago with a a friend of
[1:27:34] mine that I had the privilege of leading
[1:27:37] to Christ, Bert Call up in New
[1:27:41] Hampshire, a hunting partner. We are
[1:27:44] standing by Cobbrook Falls up in the
[1:27:46] Aderondac.
[1:27:48] And it was such a mammoth big falls. I
[1:27:51] taken my family last year up there to
[1:27:52] look at it. Way back off the road, you
[1:27:55] had to hike back to get to it. And when
[1:27:58] we seen that blue green water pouring
[1:28:01] with such mighty power out of the
[1:28:04] mountains and gushing down over the
[1:28:05] rocks, Burton stood there and looked at
[1:28:07] me and he said, "Gee, Billy, it makes a
[1:28:10] man feel just so little." He measured
[1:28:13] about a quarter of an inch on his
[1:28:14] fingers. I said, "That's right, Bert."
[1:28:17] Now, that was all he of getting into the
[1:28:20] presence of God to see his creation.
[1:28:24] I wonder the man who wrote, "How great
[1:28:26] thou art." If he didn't look up one
[1:28:28] night, look at the stars, how far they
[1:28:31] are away.
[1:28:33] A few months ago, Brother Fred, Brother
[1:28:36] Woods, and I was standing with Brother
[1:28:38] Mcilly out in the Arizona desert. We was
[1:28:41] measuring trying one star how close it
[1:28:44] was to the other. And with the millions
[1:28:48] and billions of miles away, they did
[1:28:51] look over a quarter of an inch from each
[1:28:53] other. Then we begin to think according
[1:28:56] to scientific proof of that, those stars
[1:28:59] are probably further away from each
[1:29:02] other than we are from them. See how it
[1:29:04] is? Then we realize how little we are
[1:29:08] when we realize how great he is and how
[1:29:11] close we come in coming to his presence.
[1:29:16] Somehow or another, it's always stroke a
[1:29:20] great effect upon people to come into
[1:29:23] the presence of God.
[1:29:25] I've seen the time in my ministry when
[1:29:29] you would see the presence of God come
[1:29:32] into such a place that it would bring a
[1:29:34] person up and just reveal the life to
[1:29:38] them and call out their sins of all
[1:29:42] kinds of immoral acts. And it brings
[1:29:45] such a holy hush amongst the people till
[1:29:48] they drop out of the prayer line before
[1:29:51] they ever come up to be prayed for and
[1:29:53] run to the altar, get right with God
[1:29:55] before they come up into his presence.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; There's something about coming into the
[1:30:02] presence of God.
[1:30:04] It causes things to happen. I've seen
[1:30:07] people laying in CS and stretchers that
[1:30:11] night down there at Mexico when that
[1:30:14] little dead baby laying under a blanket
[1:30:17] that the little Spanish mother brought
[1:30:19] up or little Mexican mother rather
[1:30:21] brought up. when they seen several
[1:30:26] thousands of those people saw maybe 50
[1:30:30] or 75,000
[1:30:32] at one gathering saw that little dead
[1:30:35] baby come to life went and fainted.
[1:30:39] People threw up their hands and
[1:30:40] screamed. Why? They realized that a
[1:30:44] human being could not do that. that they
[1:30:47] were in the presence of almighty God
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; and it caused something to happen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; I've been privileged to hear godly man
[1:30:57] speak. It was said one time of Charles
[1:31:00] Spinning, little bitty fella never
[1:31:03] weighed over about 110bs,
[1:31:05] but he had such a forceful way of
[1:31:07] speaking until he was trying the
[1:31:10] acoustics one day in a building. They
[1:31:12] didn't have PA systems then. And there
[1:31:15] was a man repairing up in the balcony or
[1:31:19] up in the roof of the place and he heard
[1:31:21] the man come in. So he didn't know who
[1:31:23] they were. He just kept quiet. Mr. Finny
[1:31:26] was going to try the acoustics. After
[1:31:30] spending much time in prayer for that
[1:31:32] revival that is going to hold, he tried
[1:31:35] his voice to see how it would carry. He
[1:31:37] slipped up quickly to the pullpit and
[1:31:39] said, "Repent or perish." And he said it
[1:31:42] with such for force after being on the
[1:31:45] donate God till the man dropped out of
[1:31:47] the top of the balcony down onto the
[1:31:49] floor out of the top of the building
[1:31:51] onto the floor. He preached the gospel
[1:31:54] in such way till he stood and Boston,
[1:31:57] Massachusetts in a little bay window
[1:31:59] because there's no church could hold his
[1:32:01] crowd. And he stood there with such
[1:32:04] mighty force and preached held such a
[1:32:07] place until working men with their
[1:32:09] baskets under their arms fell into the
[1:32:12] street and scream for mercy
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; in the presence of God.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Great preachers who's been able by the
[1:32:19] word of God to bring the presence of God
[1:32:22] to an audience.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; For be it that man would ever be so
[1:32:26] seared in their hearts for they could
[1:32:28] never recognize the presence of God.
[1:32:30] Amen.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Forbid
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; when the first man as soon as he had
[1:32:35] sinned and done something wrong and when
[1:32:39] God came into his presence or he came
[1:32:41] into the presence of God, Adam, he could
[1:32:45] not stand in the presence of God.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; He run and hid himself in the bush and
[1:32:50] tried to cover himself with a fig leaf
[1:32:53] because he knowed he was standing in the
[1:32:55] presence of Jehovah, the creator. That
[1:32:58] was the reaction of the first man after
[1:33:02] he had sinned and tried to come into the
[1:33:04] presence of God with sin upon his soul.
[1:33:07] He could not hide because he was tender
[1:33:10] yet. Sin had not took a hold like it has
[1:33:13] rooted into people's hearts today. But
[1:33:16] he was very conscious that he was
[1:33:18] standing before his creator.
[1:33:21] how he hid himself in the bushes and
[1:33:24] would not come out and could not come
[1:33:26] out until God had made a preparation for
[1:33:29] him.
[1:33:31] We could go back and take a Genesis the
[1:33:34] 17th chapter and the third verse when
[1:33:37] the great patriarch Abraham when he came
[1:33:41] into the presence of God and God spoke
[1:33:43] to him in the 17th chapter in the name
[1:33:46] of Almighty God, Abraham fell on his
[1:33:50] face. Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; The great patriarch
[1:33:53] servant of God could not stand in the
[1:33:56] presence of God though had served him
[1:33:58] for 25 years faithfully. But when God
[1:34:02] moved into his presence, the patriarch
[1:34:04] fell on his face because he couldn't
[1:34:06] stand in the presence of God. Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; In Exodus 3, we find that Moses, the
[1:34:13] great servant and prophet of God. When
[1:34:16] he was back on the back side of the
[1:34:18] desert, that man was a holy man. He had
[1:34:22] been born for the purpose. He was born
[1:34:24] from his mother's wombs to be a prophet.
[1:34:27] He had tried to get his education and do
[1:34:30] everything he could to deliver his
[1:34:32] people because he understood that he was
[1:34:34] to deliver his people. But when he had
[1:34:37] understood it by a theological
[1:34:40] standpoint, he was trained, he was well
[1:34:43] scholarred, he could teach the Egyptians
[1:34:46] wisdom, which was the most smartest
[1:34:48] people in the world. He know all the ins
[1:34:50] and outs. He know the scripture from A
[1:34:53] to Z. He know the promises that God had
[1:34:55] made. He know them from an intellectual
[1:34:57] standpoint. And he was a a great
[1:35:00] military man. But one day on the back
[1:35:03] side of the desert when he come into the
[1:35:05] presence of God, he jerked off his shoes
[1:35:07] and fell to his feet knowing that he was
[1:35:09] on holy ground.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; He could not stand upon his feet when he
[1:35:15] come in the presence of God. He fell to
[1:35:17] his face like Abraham did. He could not
[1:35:20] stand in the presence of God. In Exodus
[1:35:23] 19:19
[1:35:25] when the chosen people of God since the
[1:35:28] way back in the days of Abraham from
[1:35:31] Abraham come Isaac Isaac come Jacob out
[1:35:34] Jacob come the patriarchs and years
[1:35:36] after years had developed holy man great
[1:35:40] man a chosen people a chosen race a
[1:35:43] sanctified holy people and serve God
[1:35:47] their life and one day God said gather
[1:35:50] Israel out here I'm going to speak to
[1:35:52] them. But when God came down on top of
[1:35:57] Mount Si,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; and the whole mountain caught a fire and
[1:36:03] the smoke was powing from it like a
[1:36:05] furnace and the voice of God roar out.
[1:36:08] Israel fell on their face and said, "Let
[1:36:10] Moses speaking not God lest we die."
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Man in the presence of God
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; realizes he's a sinner. Yet they were
[1:36:20] everyone circumcised according to the
[1:36:23] law. They had carried the commandments
[1:36:25] and everything. But when God spoke and
[1:36:27] they moved up into his presence, they
[1:36:29] realized that they were out. They were
[1:36:32] they were not right. There was something
[1:36:35] that was lacking because they were in
[1:36:37] the presence of God.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. And they said, "Let Moses speak and
[1:36:43] not God. For if God speaks, we'll all
[1:36:46] die. Let Moses speak to us. It was in
[1:36:50] Luke 5:8 that when Peter, oh, when he
[1:36:56] was a great stubborn man and a man of
[1:37:00] great influence, great power that we
[1:37:03] understand, he was like a bully,
[1:37:06] a noted fisherman. But when he saw the
[1:37:10] miracle of God performed by an ordinary
[1:37:12] man looked like, which he recognized at
[1:37:15] that time that that taken more than a
[1:37:17] man to throw all that fish in a net
[1:37:20] where he with all of his education, his
[1:37:22] knowledge of fishing had fished all
[1:37:25] night and not even taken a thing. But he
[1:37:27] heard someone say, "Cast your net in."
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; And when he began to pull, he had a
[1:37:33] great multitude of fishes. And he
[1:37:36] realized that he was a sinful man and he
[1:37:39] said, "Depart from me, oh Lord, for I am
[1:37:42] a sinful man."
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Who said that? St. Peter.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And the presence of God asked for God to
[1:37:51] depart out of his presence because he
[1:37:53] recognized himself a sinner.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Abraham recognized himself wrong.
[1:38:00] Adam recognized himself wrong, which was
[1:38:02] the son of God, recognized himself
[1:38:05] wrong. Moses recognized himself wrong.
[1:38:08] Israel as a church and nation recognized
[1:38:11] themselves wrong.
[1:38:13] Depart from me, for I am a sinful man.
[1:38:18] He didn't try to say, "Now I'm holy and
[1:38:19] worthy to receive this." He said, "I am
[1:38:22] a sinful man."
[1:38:24] One time a selfstyle religionist with
[1:38:27] all the theology they could learn under
[1:38:29] a great teacher called Galia. His name
[1:38:32] was Saul of Tarsus which we know as
[1:38:34] Paul. Religious to the dot. He know all
[1:38:38] the ins and out of their religion. He
[1:38:40] was a Pharisee of the Pharisee and a
[1:38:42] Hebrew of the Hebrews. He was a noted
[1:38:45] man, a scholar, smart, shrewd, educated,
[1:38:50] plain old god from baby up. One day on
[1:38:53] his road down to Damascus,
[1:38:56] that pillar of fire shined over him and
[1:38:58] he fell on his off of his feet to the
[1:39:01] ground in the dust and said, "Lord, what
[1:39:04] would you have me to do?" Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; All of his great training, all of his
[1:39:08] great theological training, all of his
[1:39:10] education didn't mean a thing when he
[1:39:12] stood in the presence of God.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; I'd like to stop here a minute and say
[1:39:16] that's the same thing. You might have
[1:39:18] died DD, PhD, whatever you might be. You
[1:39:22] might have went to church since you was
[1:39:23] a child. You might have done all the
[1:39:25] religious acts there is. But once in the
[1:39:27] presence of God, you feel so little in
[1:39:29] no count.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul realized that he was
[1:39:36] wrong and he fell to the ground under
[1:39:40] the influence and power when he looked
[1:39:43] up and seen the very God that he had
[1:39:45] been preaching and against the thought
[1:39:47] he knowed and seen that he was wrong. He
[1:39:50] fell from his feet to the ground because
[1:39:53] he was in the presence of God. He seen
[1:39:56] that pillar of fire. What about the
[1:39:58] great St. John of Revelations 1:7.
[1:40:03] When he was showed the vision and looked
[1:40:06] and heard a voice speaking to him, and
[1:40:09] he turned to look to see the voice, and
[1:40:11] he saw seven golden candlesticks, and
[1:40:14] one stood in the midst of the seven
[1:40:15] golden candlesticks, with hair like
[1:40:18] wool, eyes like flames of fire, feet
[1:40:21] like pillars of brass. He was girded
[1:40:23] with a golden girdle around the patch.
[1:40:26] And he was called the word of God. And
[1:40:28] when the great saint John
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; had walked with Christ
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; leaned up on his bosom
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; when he done all these things as I said
[1:40:39] this morning Paul's ministry exceeded
[1:40:41] any of them here after John had walked
[1:40:44] with Jesus talked with him slept with
[1:40:47] him eat with him but when he seen him
[1:40:49] standing there that glorified state he
[1:40:52] said he fell like a dead Amen.
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; We can come to church and talk and
[1:41:03] praise God and so forth, but oh brother,
[1:41:06] when we see him coming,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; something will be different in our
[1:41:11] hearts.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; We might think we do our religious duty
[1:41:14] but go to church and pay our tithings.
[1:41:16] We might think we keep the laws of the
[1:41:19] church and recite all the creeds. But
[1:41:21] once let us get a look at him, the whole
[1:41:24] things changed all the way around.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's sure this great man, St. John,
[1:41:33] a great man like that, the Bible said in
[1:41:36] Revelations 1:7 that he fell as if he
[1:41:39] was a dead man.
[1:41:42] after three and a half years of
[1:41:45] fellowship with Christ was one of the
[1:41:47] writers of the epistles wrote behind
[1:41:50] him, eat with him at the table, slept
[1:41:52] with him at the bed, and fellowship with
[1:41:55] him wherever he went. But when he's
[1:41:57] turned to see him, he had no more life
[1:42:00] left in him. He fell like a dead man to
[1:42:04] the floor or to the ground. All right,
[1:42:07] we see Isaiah in Isaiah 6 and5 as we've
[1:42:11] just read
[1:42:14] this great mighty prophet.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; He's one of the greatest prophets there
[1:42:18] is in the Bible. There's 66 books of the
[1:42:22] Bible. There's 66 chapters in Isaiah.
[1:42:25] Isaiah starts off in Genesis. The middle
[1:42:28] of Isaiah, he brings in the New
[1:42:30] Testament. At the end of Isaiah, he
[1:42:32] brings in the millennium. just exactly
[1:42:34] Genesis, the New Testament, and
[1:42:36] Revelations. Perfect. Isaiah was one of
[1:42:40] the major prophets. But one day he had
[1:42:43] been leaning upon the arm of Hezekiah,
[1:42:46] the great king Hezekiah taken from him,
[1:42:50] and he was down. He was a pretty good
[1:42:51] fellow. He's a good righteous man. If
[1:42:54] that righteous king, a good king,
[1:42:57] recognized him as a holy man and kept
[1:43:00] him in his temple. Isaiah saw visions.
[1:43:03] He was a prophet. Isaiah preached the
[1:43:06] word. He was a minister.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Isaiah was a holy man.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; But one day
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; down in the temple, he fell into a
[1:43:14] trance and he saw the glory of God.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; He saw the angels with wings over their
[1:43:21] face, wings over their feet, flying with
[1:43:24] wings, crying, "Holy, holy, holy is the
[1:43:27] Lord God Almighty."
[1:43:30] That prophet realized he was nothing.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Woe is me, for I am a man of
[1:43:37] unclean lips, a prophet,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; a mightest prophet of the Bible, one of
[1:43:43] them. I am a man with unclean lips, and
[1:43:46] I dwell among people, it's unclean lips.
[1:43:49] Woe is me because I see the glory of
[1:43:51] God." And he said, "When that angel
[1:43:53] cried, the post of the temple shook back
[1:43:56] and forth."
[1:43:59] Brother,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; that'll make you not only does the post
[1:44:02] of the temple go to shake, but the whole
[1:44:04] heavens and earth go to shake.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; The mountains will flee and the seal
[1:44:09] fade away and scream, "Hide us from the
[1:44:12] face of him that sits upon the throne."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a terrible time. I tell
[1:44:18] you, sinner friend, you better be
[1:44:19] checking it up.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Now, Isaiah said, "Woe is me. I am a man
[1:44:26] of unclean lips and I dwell among
[1:44:28] unclean people and I'm these people as
[1:44:31] unclean lips. Now remember, if such holy
[1:44:36] man
[1:44:37] recognize themselves sinners in the
[1:44:40] presence of God, what will the sinner
[1:44:44] and ungodly do at that day?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; What will people do who set in the
[1:44:51] meetings?
[1:44:54] What will the people do that's seen the
[1:44:56] power of God, that's heard the countdown
[1:44:59] on the word,
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; that's seen God manifest himself and
[1:45:03] beyond a shadow of doubt ever scripture
[1:45:05] fulfilled
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; and will still try to make it to heaven
[1:45:10] without being born again and receive the
[1:45:12] Holy Ghost.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "If a righteous man be
[1:45:16] scarcely saved, where will the sinner
[1:45:18] and ungodly appear?" Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; What kind of a place are we going to
[1:45:23] stand in if we see God unfold himself
[1:45:26] right before us and see the glory of God
[1:45:28] just the same as that man did? And that
[1:45:31] kind of man cried out. Prophets and
[1:45:33] sages
[1:45:35] upon whom the word is based upon. If
[1:45:38] they cried and fell to their feet and
[1:45:41] screamed, "A man of unholy lips,
[1:45:44] uncleanness."
[1:45:46] What will it be then for that man who
[1:45:48] won't even confess his sins?
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; What will it be for that teenager that
[1:45:53] won't confess his or her sins?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; What will it be for that hard-hearted
[1:45:58] man that thinks he knows more about uh
[1:46:00] God's creation, God does himself? What
[1:46:03] will happen to that man spent all of his
[1:46:05] life trying to disprove the Bible?
[1:46:08] Where will that guy appear at?
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; This is evangelism.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; This is a time to shake people.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; This is a time that God said there come
[1:46:19] a time he shook Mount Si one time, but
[1:46:22] there come a shaking again that he
[1:46:24] wouldn't only shake Mount Si, but he
[1:46:26] shake everything that could be moved.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; But did you notice the rest of
[1:46:31] scripture? But we receive a kingdom that
[1:46:34] cannot be moved.
[1:46:37] Hallelujah.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Everything that can be shock will be
[1:46:40] shaken.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; The heavens will shake. The earth will
[1:46:44] shake. Heavens and earth will pass away.
[1:46:46] But that word shall never pass away. For
[1:46:49] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[1:46:52] the gates of hell will never break.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Everything that can be shut will be
[1:46:58] shaken. But we receive a kingdom which
[1:47:01] is the word of God himself. And God is
[1:47:04] his word. He don't shake himself.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But we receive a kingdom that
[1:47:12] cannot be moved.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; It's unshakable, said Paul, the Hebrew
[1:47:17] writer. Such a person, and such a man,
[1:47:21] such a time, and how they felt. We have
[1:47:24] also ourselves. We've seen the glory of
[1:47:27] God like this man did.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; sir. We seen it. We see the glory of God
[1:47:33] like Abraham saw it.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; We saw the glory of God like Moses saw
[1:47:38] it.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Same pillar of fire.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; The same power of God.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; The same Christ unrevealing himself,
[1:47:45] showing himself, keeping his word in the
[1:47:47] last day. How can we come by then and
[1:47:50] walk and treat it so lightly?
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; How can we walk around and hold our
[1:47:56] creeds and denominations and not take
[1:47:58] the word of God?
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. What will it be for us in that
[1:48:01] day? How will it happen with us when we
[1:48:05] see the glory of God? Some people stand
[1:48:07] off and make fun of it.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Some will laugh at it. Some will call it
[1:48:12] fanaticism. Some call it mental
[1:48:13] telepathy.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Some call it beyond.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Some call it one thing or another.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; As the old proverbs is, fools will walk
[1:48:22] with hobb shoes where angels prayer to
[1:48:25] try.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:48:28] The fool has said in his heart, "There
[1:48:30] is no God." When he sees God manifested
[1:48:33] so perfectly by his own word, not by a
[1:48:36] creed, but by his word, and then walk
[1:48:38] right over it and make fun of it, he's a
[1:48:39] fool.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; As God is the word, and God's made
[1:48:43] himself clean to him,
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; and he's a fool, the Bible say,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; what will it be for him when he has to
[1:48:50] stand in that place? It'll be a it'll be
[1:48:53] terrible for that man in that day, the
[1:48:55] ungodly.
[1:49:06] I certainly hope you can recognize the
[1:49:10] contrast.
[1:49:12] Okay? But that's what we need.
[1:49:15] We need the presence of God. We need to
[1:49:19] feel the presence of God. You can't
[1:49:24] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:49:27] without coming into the presence of God.
[1:49:30] And so we I just want to uh uh
[1:49:36] you know in a just in this manner of of
[1:49:41] talking why it's so important to come
[1:49:44] into the presence of God. And and so
[1:49:52] we we understand that that that's
[1:49:56] if you want to worship somebody or
[1:49:58] fellowship with somebody, you got to
[1:50:01] come in his presence. You You know what
[1:50:04] I mean? And and that's what we're here.
[1:50:08] We're here to worship him. So in order
[1:50:11] to worship him, we want to come into his
[1:50:13] presence. We want to we want to feel his
[1:50:17] spirit is here amongst us. We want to
[1:50:21] we we want to be able to open our hearts
[1:50:24] to him. But because there's certain
[1:50:28] results,
[1:50:30] certain things happen in the presence of
[1:50:33] God, people shy away from it.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's just take just a few
[1:50:41] moments. we won't be long at all. He
[1:50:44] says he he says this. He says
[1:50:49] we realize how little we are when we
[1:50:52] realize how great he is and h how close
[1:50:56] we come and how close we come in of
[1:51:02] coming to his presence.
[1:51:05] somehow or another it always throws a
[1:51:08] great effect upon the people to come
[1:51:12] into the presence of God. So we
[1:51:15] understand that God's presence
[1:51:18] has an effect.
[1:51:21] You you understand and and so you your
[1:51:26] your human nature,
[1:51:29] right? So we we begin to understand that
[1:51:32] that the the presence of God has an
[1:51:34] effect. So the the it it causes things
[1:51:40] to happen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; You you understand? So I'm I'm just
[1:51:44] saying that you don't control the
[1:51:47] presence of God. The presence of God
[1:51:51] controls the atmosphere. The presence of
[1:51:54] God takes command
[1:51:56] over the situation. When the presence of
[1:52:00] God comes, everything falls subject to
[1:52:04] the presence of God. It it's eternal.
[1:52:07] It's supreme. It It's the ultimate. It's
[1:52:11] the end of the story. In fact, there's
[1:52:14] nothing to be said in the presence of
[1:52:18] God.
[1:52:20] And so, we understand that he says these
[1:52:22] things. He said he says
[1:52:26] he he he says the presence of God come
[1:52:29] into such a place that it would bring a
[1:52:32] person up and just reveal the life to
[1:52:36] them and call out their sins and kinds
[1:52:39] of immoral acts. It brings such a holy
[1:52:43] hush
[1:52:45] amongst the people. Hallelujah.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Now he he you know it that's something
[1:52:51] isn't it?
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; It brings such a holy hush amongst the
[1:52:56] people
[1:53:00] and
[1:53:02] we we've been taught
[1:53:05] you know be still and know that I'm God.
[1:53:09] The presence of God brings such a holy
[1:53:13] hush amongst the people. So if the
[1:53:17] people aren't desiring the presence of
[1:53:20] God, they're going to make a lot of
[1:53:22] noise
[1:53:26] because the presence of God brings an
[1:53:29] effect. So we love to worship them.
[1:53:33] Lord, you stay up there. We'll stay down
[1:53:36] here. We'll praise you. We'll worship
[1:53:38] you. We'll have a good time. We'll sing
[1:53:40] our songs. We'll operate everything. But
[1:53:44] you just accept our worship.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; But we know
[1:53:51] if you come in here
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; in our presence,
[1:53:58] there is going to be a holy hush.
[1:54:03] Every single one of those men that that
[1:54:06] came into the presence of God, every
[1:54:10] single one of them begin to do a
[1:54:12] self-examination.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Paul, Moses, all of them.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; He said John walked with them, ate with
[1:54:26] them, talked with them, lived with them.
[1:54:30] But when he come into that presence, he
[1:54:32] felt as a dead man.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; So we we got to understand there's a
[1:54:39] reason that man has been shying away
[1:54:43] from the presence of God and the true
[1:54:46] baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now
[1:54:49] remember, the anointing can fall on the
[1:54:51] just and the unjust. We won't go into a
[1:54:53] lot of teaching on gifts,
[1:54:56] but the presence of God does something
[1:54:59] to you.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; He makes this statement. It brings a
[1:55:03] holy hush. He says, "See, there's
[1:55:06] something about coming into the presence
[1:55:08] of God that causes things to happen."
[1:55:15] Things to happen. So these are
[1:55:18] evidences, if I could say that, that the
[1:55:21] messenger's
[1:55:23] telling us and bringing to us. He says
[1:55:26] when God comes, the atmosphere changes.
[1:55:30] When God comes, men change. When God
[1:55:34] comes, if you are no longer in control.
[1:55:38] And that's what man has always wanted to
[1:55:42] do is be in control. They want to
[1:55:45] control their singing. They want to
[1:55:46] control their worship. They want to
[1:55:48] control how their reaction is. They want
[1:55:51] to control how people look at them.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; You could be the greatest preacher in
[1:55:58] the world. The presence of God comes on
[1:56:00] you. You'll be on your floor. You'll be
[1:56:03] crying and balling in the presence of
[1:56:06] God because you realize that you are a
[1:56:10] sinner.
[1:56:14] The only place a man can be great and be
[1:56:17] important is outside of the presence of
[1:56:21] God.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; So we got to understand why that we're
[1:56:29] shying away from it.
[1:56:36] Man likes to operate as a group.
[1:56:40] comfort in numbers.
[1:56:42] But if there's sin in our midst, then
[1:56:44] we'll want to shy away from the presence
[1:56:46] of God. If there's not sincerity in our
[1:56:49] midst, we'll shy away from the presence
[1:56:52] of God. If there's not dedication, we'll
[1:56:54] shy away from the presence of God. If we
[1:56:57] come just to fulfill an obligation,
[1:57:00] we're not going to be looking for the
[1:57:01] presence of God.
[1:57:04] We want to go beyond what we believe.
[1:57:09] We want to get into that place where we
[1:57:13] can invite the presence of God and let
[1:57:17] God make things happen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You know, we let things slip.
[1:57:27] like young ladies, you we we we preach
[1:57:31] against high heels and in tight dresses
[1:57:36] and and things that allows you to
[1:57:39] present your body as a sex object. We
[1:57:43] preach against those things because th
[1:57:46] those things are the things that the
[1:57:48] makes the Holy Spirit just fly away,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; you know. I mean, and then things start
[1:57:57] thing we just start letting those bars
[1:57:59] down. We don't worry about our hair and
[1:58:02] and we don't worry about there's certain
[1:58:04] things we don't worry about. We we we we
[1:58:06] forget about the ABCs. We forget about
[1:58:10] those fundamentals. We do those things,
[1:58:14] you understand? in preparation
[1:58:17] for the presence of God to come and and
[1:58:22] and not to do that because we we we know
[1:58:27] there's certain things like we've been
[1:58:29] reading that the presence of God does.
[1:58:32] Far be it it that a man would ever be so
[1:58:37] scared in his heart till that he could
[1:58:40] never recognize the presence of God.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:46] Now look at what he's saying. He says,
[1:58:51] he's saying people are afraid of the
[1:58:54] presence of God. He says, "Far be it
[1:58:56] from us." We get to the place that we're
[1:58:59] afraid of the presence of God because
[1:59:01] the presence of God's going to convict
[1:59:03] us of sin. Any man that came into the
[1:59:06] presence of God realized he's a sinner.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; And that's not a good feeling.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; It brings conviction.
[1:59:22] And those are the things we get away
[1:59:24] from. But once we can understand that,
[1:59:27] sure the presence of God convicts us of
[1:59:29] sin. Sure, the presence of God tells us
[1:59:32] we're wrong. But that presence bring
[1:59:34] makes things happen. It it makes us
[1:59:38] realize that we're nothing and he's
[1:59:40] everything and he still loves us.
[1:59:52] says because he was
[1:59:56] he's talking about that was the reaction
[1:59:59] of the first man
[2:00:02] after he had sinned and tried into the
[2:00:05] come into the presence of God with sin
[2:00:08] upon his soul. He could not hide because
[2:00:11] he was tender
[2:00:14] yet.
[2:00:19] And and the this is the thing as a
[2:00:21] pastor
[2:00:24] is that I afraid we're losing that
[2:00:28] tenderness.
[2:00:33] You know, we've fallen into we're going
[2:00:36] to have song service. We're going to
[2:00:38] have programs. We're going to have
[2:00:40] preaching. We're to discuss our creeds
[2:00:43] and our doctrines of what I believe.
[2:00:45] Like I said, most people, they're
[2:00:48] members of a message. They're not
[2:00:50] members of a body.
[2:00:53] This is just a place they come to
[2:00:57] fulfill their obligations to the
[2:01:00] message.
[2:01:02] But that's never been the body of
[2:01:04] Christ.
[2:01:06] It's always been people that loved one
[2:01:08] another and were fitted and joined
[2:01:11] together and they ministered to one
[2:01:13] another. They lived for one another.
[2:01:16] They they they worked together for the
[2:01:20] furtherance of of one another and the
[2:01:22] helping of one another to come into the
[2:01:25] presence of God.
[2:01:28] But he said even Adam he said
[2:01:33] he he he said he was still tender yet
[2:01:36] sin had not took a hold like it has
[2:01:40] rooted into people's hearts today.
[2:01:45] See sin has got rooted into our hearts.
[2:01:48] In other words when something's rooted
[2:01:50] into your heart it becomes okay.
[2:01:53] Things have become okay.
[2:01:58] It's never okay to talk about somebody.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; It's never okay to murder somebody's
[2:02:07] influence. It's never okay to gossip.
[2:02:13] And let me say this, it's never okay to
[2:02:16] look back on your life once the blood of
[2:02:19] Jesus Christ has forgiven you.
[2:02:26] Don't pull things out from under the
[2:02:30] blood.
[2:02:32] He says he he he says but he was very
[2:02:38] conscious
[2:02:40] that he was standing before his creator.
[2:02:47] He was still he was conscious.
[2:02:52] Brother Bren preached sermons like Jesus
[2:02:54] with dirty feet where he sat in the
[2:02:57] corner. He preached a message the
[2:03:00] unrecognized
[2:03:01] presence of God.
[2:03:06] He's he's talking to a nation and and to
[2:03:10] a people.
[2:03:13] And it's the very presence of God, the
[2:03:16] son of man ministry. God veiling
[2:03:18] himself, Jesus Christ present with them
[2:03:22] using a prophet man as a veil and
[2:03:26] looking out of the people and they don't
[2:03:28] recognize it. They don't sense it. They
[2:03:31] don't feel it. They don't feel the
[2:03:32] holiness. That's why the lot of the
[2:03:34] people rejected the prophet of God
[2:03:37] because whenever he'd come, he'd bring
[2:03:39] conviction.
[2:03:42] He they didn't like the fact the women
[2:03:44] didn't like the fact the way that he
[2:03:46] made them feel
[2:03:49] cuz I'll tell you what the presence of
[2:03:51] God made them feel. They felt naked,
[2:03:55] blind, miserable, poor, and wretched.
[2:04:02] And and we we don't want to slip church
[2:04:06] into being church. We don't want to slip
[2:04:09] into religion. We don't want to slip
[2:04:11] into creating an atmosphere and an
[2:04:14] attitude about one another. We don't
[2:04:17] want to get to the place I belong. I'm
[2:04:19] okay.
[2:04:22] We want to be able to get to the place
[2:04:24] I'm going to come into the presence of
[2:04:26] God.
[2:04:27] And if it slays me,
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; and that's what we could probably should
[2:04:34] all use as a good slaying, don't you
[2:04:36] think?
[2:04:40] And that's what I'm trying to say
[2:04:44] is that we've got to get back to the
[2:04:48] ABCs.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; We've got to get back to the
[2:04:52] fundamentals.
[2:04:53] We've got to get back where right is
[2:04:56] right and wrong is wrong.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; We've got to get back to the book. We've
[2:05:01] got to get back to the word. You can I
[2:05:04] it can say we, but we is me and thee.
[2:05:12] You've got to get back. I've got to get
[2:05:14] back. I've got to reestablish. I've got
[2:05:17] to take a look at myself. I I've got to
[2:05:20] do those things. You know, the prophet
[2:05:24] of God, he preached,
[2:05:26] you know, he called the Beatles,
[2:05:28] remember? recalled the Beatles haircut
[2:05:29] and he talked about bangs on their heads
[2:05:32] and and all that and and now it's all
[2:05:35] over the message in our young kids.
[2:05:39] We don't even hardly have a the the
[2:05:43] guy's standards are going down
[2:05:49] and and those are things that and I'm
[2:05:51] not talking about from the trying to
[2:05:54] condemn anybody. I'm talking about our
[2:05:58] return
[2:06:00] back to the presence of God.
[2:06:05] Back to where we don't come into church.
[2:06:08] When you walk through those doors and
[2:06:11] you sit in your seat, you should start
[2:06:14] inviting the presence of God
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; in.
[2:06:21] Lord, if nobody in here wants your
[2:06:23] presence, Lord, please let your presence
[2:06:27] fall upon me.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to to discern me, my my
[2:06:35] thoughts and intents
[2:06:38] of my heart. I I want you to go uh
[2:06:41] through my life. He says, "A man in the
[2:06:43] presence of God realizes he's a sinner.
[2:06:50] Nobody likes correction.
[2:06:54] I certainly don't.
[2:06:59] You know, I like I I I can Give me a bit
[2:07:02] of time and I'll justify every mistake
[2:07:05] I've ever made and I'll show you somehow
[2:07:09] that I was right.
[2:07:12] That's human nature.
[2:07:15] And those are the things that we want to
[2:07:17] lay down. Lord, I'm laying down my
[2:07:21] nature for your nature. I want to be in
[2:07:24] your presence. But it's that conviction
[2:07:27] of sin.
[2:07:29] What did Adam do?
[2:07:32] He used to walk with them in the
[2:07:34] evening.
[2:07:36] Then he realized he's a sinner. And what
[2:07:39] did he do?
[2:07:42] He ran and hid.
[2:07:46] Well, where do you think that we would
[2:07:48] do?
[2:07:53] What would I do?
[2:07:57] Well, I would run and hide, too.
[2:08:00] You say, "Oh, I wouldn't run and hide."
[2:08:02] Yeah, you would.
[2:08:04] You know what? What Adam was afraid of?
[2:08:06] He's afraid God was going to kill him.
[2:08:09] And God would have killed him.
[2:08:13] But instead, God
[2:08:15] did a lamb sacrifice to cover his sins.
[2:08:19] And the prophet of God will go into this
[2:08:21] in the next part of the tape, how God
[2:08:24] gave us a lamb sacrifice, too.
[2:08:28] Sure, he'd run and hide. So, what's our
[2:08:30] nature? If we're going to come in here
[2:08:33] all full of the world, all backslid, all
[2:08:36] kinds of junk on our lives, doing all
[2:08:39] kinds of stuff, no, we're not going to
[2:08:42] run into the presence of God. We're
[2:08:44] going to hide in church.
[2:08:50] There's no bushes to hide behind. So, we
[2:08:52] hide behind doctrine. We hide behind
[2:08:55] song service. We hide behind
[2:08:57] personality. We hide behind the message.
[2:09:00] We hide behind the pillar of fire. We
[2:09:03] hide behind the cloud. We hide behind
[2:09:06] who we are.
[2:09:11] But we won't stand naked.
[2:09:14] Excuse the expression.
[2:09:17] Because that's what Adam realized.
[2:09:21] All of a sudden, he realized he was
[2:09:24] naked
[2:09:26] and he didn't want to go
[2:09:29] into the presence of the Lord naked. How
[2:09:33] many knows what religion is?
[2:09:37] It's a covering
[2:09:42] that thy nakedness
[2:09:45] does not appear.
[2:09:49] You can have all the anointing, all the
[2:09:52] gifts, but when his presence come, the
[2:09:56] gift stops, the anointing stops, and
[2:09:59] there's a holy hush.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; If you're feeling conviction,
[2:10:08] that's a good thing.
[2:10:13] That's the first sign
[2:10:18] of his presence.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; When his presence comes, the first thing
[2:10:24] that happens, everybody that's a sinner,
[2:10:28] all the sin in your life all of a sudden
[2:10:31] is exposed. And you feel you're a
[2:10:34] sinner. You feel you're unworthy. You
[2:10:37] feel you're no good. You feel that all
[2:10:40] that your big mouth rolls on about
[2:10:43] yourself and all the theology that pours
[2:10:46] out of your mouth, all the types and
[2:10:49] wisdom that you have, it starts to
[2:10:53] shrink
[2:10:56] and pretty soon you realize I'm not so
[2:11:00] big.
[2:11:03] He said when the presence of God, man
[2:11:06] realizes how little
[2:11:10] they are.
[2:11:16] And that's why that we
[2:11:19] we tend
[2:11:23] to
[2:11:25] avoid the presence of God because our
[2:11:28] conscience bothers us.
[2:11:32] And we substitute
[2:11:36] we substitute anointing for holiness.
[2:11:40] We substitute doctrine for life.
[2:11:44] But there's nothing that substitutes for
[2:11:47] the presence of God in our life. And
[2:11:51] that's what he said. He says he realizes
[2:11:55] what he sinners. He says here, he says,
[2:11:58] ' I'd like to stop here a minute and say
[2:12:00] this the same thing. You might have a a
[2:12:03] DD, a PhD, whatever you might be. You
[2:12:07] might have went to church since you was
[2:12:10] a child.
[2:12:11] You might have done all the religious
[2:12:13] acts there is, but once in the presence
[2:12:18] of God, you feel so little and no count.
[2:12:27] That's true.
[2:12:30] And I don't want to feel that way,
[2:12:34] but I need to feel that way.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I need the presence of God to put me in
[2:12:40] my place,
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; which is nothing but a sinner
[2:12:49] saved by grace.
[2:12:54] And we need to let that marinate.
[2:12:58] And that's what I'm saying. As you come
[2:13:00] to the close and that presence is there,
[2:13:06] if we're not careful, we'll just say,
[2:13:07] "Oh, that's a good sermon." Clap, clap,
[2:13:09] clap.
[2:13:10] And you've pulled it out of the marinade
[2:13:14] and it won't get the flavor.
[2:13:21] We're preaching these things
[2:13:25] for you to take the word of God
[2:13:28] personally
[2:13:30] and you make your life better.
[2:13:34] You let it convict you of sin. You let
[2:13:36] it take you to your home and apply the
[2:13:40] token.
[2:13:43] Paul said, "All things are lawful for
[2:13:45] me, but all things aren't expedient."
[2:13:48] You've got to make choices.
[2:13:53] And and I love the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:56] Spirit for what e what nominal people
[2:14:00] feel it is the rain, the blessings.
[2:14:07] And that's good. That's great.
[2:14:11] But if you're not careful,
[2:14:13] that actually becomes a substitute.
[2:14:20] And that's what they say. Look at God's
[2:14:22] with us. Look at all the miracles.
[2:14:28] And they're live contrary to the word of
[2:14:30] God.
[2:14:33] You say, we say,
[2:14:36] seek after the baptism of the Holy
[2:14:38] Spirit. You want to be baptized by his
[2:14:40] spirit, come into his presence.
[2:14:43] That's what the baptism of the Holy
[2:14:46] Spirit is. It's a man or a woman that's
[2:14:50] come into his presence, recognized how
[2:14:53] little they are, recognized how great
[2:14:56] they he is, recognized that they're a
[2:14:59] sinner,
[2:15:01] recognized that they need what he is,
[2:15:07] and they ask him to change them.
[2:15:13] And that nature changes. Anybody
[2:15:18] that ever gives you an evidence is
[2:15:20] giving you a substitute for the presence
[2:15:22] of God.
[2:15:26] You say, "Well, I would never be able to
[2:15:29] come into the presence of God." Thank
[2:15:32] God for Calvary.
[2:15:36] Thank God for the blood that there's a
[2:15:40] place that I can meet him under the shed
[2:15:42] blood. Thank God I can apply that blood
[2:15:46] to the post of my life and walk into his
[2:15:49] presence crying holy, holy, holy, holy
[2:15:53] is the lamb of God. Holy is the host of
[2:15:58] Israel.
[2:16:00] Thank you Lord for paying for my
[2:16:03] unworthiness
[2:16:06] and let the wonderful spirit of God's
[2:16:09] word move.
[2:16:13] He says, "We can come to church and talk
[2:16:18] and praise God and so forth,
[2:16:22] but oh brother, when we see him coming,
[2:16:27] something will be different in our
[2:16:32] heart."
[2:16:38] He and he he goes on to say here
[2:16:43] he says we might think that we keep the
[2:16:46] law of the church and recite all the
[2:16:50] creeds but once let us get a look at him
[2:16:55] the whole things changed all the way
[2:16:58] around.
[2:17:00] Yes sir. Sure.
[2:17:03] So I I want you to understand
[2:17:07] that I'm I'm I'm not wanting to bring
[2:17:11] condemnation,
[2:17:13] but I'm wanting to bring realization.
[2:17:17] I want to put him back where he belongs.
[2:17:23] Not the ministry, not our knowledge of
[2:17:26] the message, not our understanding of
[2:17:29] the revelation,
[2:17:31] but understanding that we are gathered
[2:17:34] here today, Lord,
[2:17:37] that we can come into your presence.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; We know we're sinners,
[2:17:45] but your presence changes things.
[2:17:49] It's his presence that heals the sick.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; It's not the power
[2:17:57] of your faith.
[2:17:59] It's your faith in that he's here
[2:18:04] and that he's the same yesterday, today,
[2:18:07] and forever. And that he's presence.
[2:18:12] Every time in the prayer line that
[2:18:14] someone would come before the prophet,
[2:18:17] he said, "Oh, you feel that warm spirit
[2:18:20] on you." He says, "Oh, that's just him.
[2:18:25] He's here."
[2:18:31] And don't you want that?
[2:18:34] That's what you got to ask your heart,
[2:18:37] young people, old people, all of us. Do
[2:18:41] we want the presence
[2:18:44] of the Lord?
[2:18:47] Let's not get away from it. Let's get
[2:18:50] back to it. Let's go back to the way of
[2:18:53] a true prophet.
[2:18:56] Let's go back
[2:18:59] to how we fundamentally
[2:19:03] prepare our lives to come into his
[2:19:07] presence.
[2:19:08] Let's invite
[2:19:11] his presence.
[2:19:13] When you come to church,
[2:19:18] just don't run in here late.
[2:19:23] Come to church like you know he'll be
[2:19:25] here,
[2:19:27] like his presence is here, and that he's
[2:19:30] here to do for you exceedingly and
[2:19:34] abundantly
[2:19:36] above what
[2:19:38] we could ask or think. So that's why
[2:19:41] we've asked
[2:19:45] so we you can let it marinate
[2:19:49] and you can think about it and you can
[2:19:53] apply it to your life. We can look in
[2:19:56] the mirror
[2:19:59] and see ourselves
[2:20:01] and then I believe with all our hearts
[2:20:03] we can start to say even so come quickly
[2:20:08] Lord Jesus God bless you. Uh uh you're
[2:20:13] Is this your
[2:20:16] Okay, you're ready. You want to be
[2:20:17] baptized then, sister?
[2:20:20] Good. God bless you. That's wonderful.
[2:20:23] Mag, you can guys go. We're going to go
[2:20:26] prepare for baptism. I know some of you
[2:20:29] may have to go. Uh but we're going to
[2:20:33] baptize this young uh lady. Uh, I think
[2:20:38] she's Magnus
[2:20:40] niece
[2:20:41] cousin. Okay.
[2:20:45] That means different things in different
[2:20:47] countries, you know.
[2:20:50] So, this is wonderful.
[2:20:52] Amen. It's great.
[2:20:56] This thrills my heart, you know,
[2:20:59] because there's nothing like giving your
[2:21:01] life to the Lord and trying to start on
[2:21:05] the path and just, you know, what the
[2:21:08] presence of God can do
[2:21:11] for her
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; and her life. It's wonderful. Brother
[2:21:15] Billy, if you'd come and
[2:21:19] I don't know which deacon's going to
[2:21:21] help me baptize, but if we'll do, we'll
[2:21:25] do that. God bless you. Thank you for
[2:21:29] understanding my heart and the path I
[2:21:32] want to take.
[2:21:34] Certainly,
[2:21:36] you're not obligated to come here.
[2:21:39] You're not obligated to go down the road
[2:21:42] that
[2:21:43] I feel the Holy Spirit's leading the
[2:21:45] church, but you are obligated to what
[2:21:49] you heard on the tape. God bless you.
[2:22:01] Amen. Let's just sing that in the
[2:22:03] presence of Jehovah.

[2:33:03] spirit
[2:33:06] as

[2:33:17] and she understands
[2:33:20] when she's baptized
[2:33:24] that old
[2:33:27] and she comes up
[2:33:30] in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:33:33] and she has a promise
[2:33:37] that she's
[2:33:47] possessingly
[2:33:55] precious promises that we partakers
[2:34:00] of divine nature
[2:34:20] and we'll read starting the third
[2:34:26] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:34:28] know that God made the same Jesus whom
[2:34:34] he had crucified both Lord and Christ.
[2:34:38] When they heard this, they were pricked
[2:34:41] in their hearts and said unto Peter and
[2:34:44] the rest of the apostles, "Men and
[2:34:47] brethren, what shall we do?"
[2:34:54] and beaptus
[2:34:58] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:35:01] and you shall receive the gift of
[2:35:05] the promises of youth and to your
[2:35:09] children and all that
[2:35:13] even
[2:35:17] with many other
[2:35:19] testify and exort
[2:35:21] yourselves from this generation and they
[2:35:26] gladly receive his word baptized and the
[2:35:30] same day they were added to him about
[2:35:34] 3,000
[2:35:35] souls
[2:35:37] and I say
[2:35:44] it never
[2:35:56] My precious sister
[2:36:02] according to God's word
[2:36:04] and his commission
[2:36:07] to go into all the world and tell the
[2:36:09] world about the power of the blood, the
[2:36:14] forgiveness of the cross, the power of
[2:36:16] the resurrection. ction, the return of
[2:36:19] the spirit of God upon man's life.
[2:36:23] According to this commission,

[2:36:32] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:36:49] Amen. Let's all stand and sing. I've

[2:36:57] into the water and I be
[2:37:03] in the blood of the lamb.
[2:37:07] And I've been changed from the church. I
[2:37:12] was born redeemed.

[2:40:02] But you if you could just come and
[2:40:04] dismiss us this morning. Amen.
[2:40:07] [Music]
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Wanted to quickly
[2:40:17] share this one thing with you. One verse
[2:40:19] comes from Judges uh 3:31.
[2:40:23] And it says, "And after him was Shamgar,
[2:40:27] the son of Anath, which slew the
[2:40:30] Palestinians, 600 men's with an ox god,
[2:40:35] and he also delivered Israel." Brother
[2:40:38] Brennan uh this bless the verse has
[2:40:40] blessed me tremendously. Brother
[2:40:42] Brunham, he explained that the shamgar
[2:40:46] is you and I. And uh this uh
[2:40:52] field is our mind. Every single day we
[2:40:55] wake up, we have to face the 600 evil
[2:41:00] spirits, demons ready to possess our
[2:41:02] bodies.
[2:41:04] We need to protect our families. And as
[2:41:07] we move into this new week, we need to
[2:41:10] cover ourselves, our families, our
[2:41:13] brothers and sisters under the blood of
[2:41:15] Lord Jesus Christ. Let's pray. Dear
[2:41:18] father God, thank you for this beautiful
[2:41:22] day that that you have brought in our
[2:41:24] lives for such a beautiful message by
[2:41:27] brother David. The only way forward is
[2:41:31] going backward and the backward is going
[2:41:34] to the word of God which is our absolute
[2:41:37] Lord. When we come to the word of God,
[2:41:40] we receive the revelation as uh we
[2:41:44] receive when we read the word uh uh it
[2:41:48] comes by hearing and uh uh is that much
[2:41:51] needed faith that we get when we read
[2:41:54] the word of God. Lord, I pray uh every
[2:41:57] single one of us here, Lord, you anoint
[2:42:00] us uh with your Holy Spirit. Cover us
[2:42:03] under your blood. All the brothers and
[2:42:05] sisters who are watching um through the
[2:42:07] online service, Lord, I pray you bless
[2:42:10] them as well. Lord, I pray as we move
[2:42:13] into uh this new week. Lord, may your
[2:42:15] presence be upon us, Lord. Also as we
[2:42:18] come back for the evening service, let
[2:42:21] that service be also blessed and
[2:42:24] everything and everything we do Lord we
[2:42:26] all only do it for the extension of your
[2:42:28] com of your glory of your kingdom and to
[2:42:32] glorify you Lord. In the name of Lord
[2:42:34] Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:42:41] [Music]
[2:42:56] It's amazing, man. Praise God. I you are
[2:43:00] dismissed this morning. Oh, and my my my
[2:43:05] joy you're serving my Jesus.
[2:43:09] more than I could explain the way I
[2:43:13] feel.
[2:43:15] He's singing unspeakable joy and full of
