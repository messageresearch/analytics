[22:14] Oh, what year on earth? Hallelujah.
[22:19] Oh, let it glorify
[22:22] all that you are worth.
[22:26] Oh, I am nothing.
[22:31] I am nothing.
[22:34] Oh, and without you.
[22:41] Oh, and all my soul
[22:50] is all your love
[22:56] to cover me.
[22:59] All the world
[23:04] will see
[23:07] I am nothing
[23:12] without you.
[23:15] Oh heavenly father,
[23:18] what a testimony
[23:21] that we could be so humble
[23:24] and so reliant on you
[23:29] that people could actually see that this
[23:31] person would be nothing if it wasn't for
[23:35] Jesus.
[23:39] They would see how that we looked to you
[23:41] and how we prayed over our food and
[23:46] prayed over our daily task
[23:50] and how we'd commit everything into your
[23:52] hand.
[23:55] And they could visibly see our light
[23:58] shining and see your grace
[24:02] ordering our footsteps.
[24:05] and they would stand back in amazement
[24:07] and say, "Oh,
[24:09] God must be taking care of this fella."
[24:13] Lord, I longed
[24:16] not to have that testimony,
[24:19] but to have that type of experience
[24:22] that the testimony would follow. We ask
[24:26] you to bless us tonight. Speak to our
[24:28] hearts. Father, I feel led this evening
[24:32] by your grace and your mercy and your
[24:35] spirit to point us in this direction.
[24:39] And Lord, I ask that you come and walk
[24:41] in your word. We ask it in Jesus
[24:44] precious name we pray. Amen.
[24:48] Amen. Lord bless you. If you have your
[24:50] Bibles, let's just turn real quick and
[24:52] we'll read a a quick portion of
[24:55] scripture found in Luke the uh
[25:01] 24th
[25:03] chapter in the 12th verse.
[25:11] And this is the story of the road to
[25:14] Emmas
[25:15] which I I believe many of you are uh fi
[25:19] very familiar with and uh it's a
[25:22] wonderful portion of scripture because
[25:25] it reveals so much. Yeah, it says here
[25:35] and the the women had just come back,
[25:38] you know, um to the apostles and
[25:42] reported to them that they went to the
[25:45] tomb and the tomb was uh empty. And
[25:48] listen to these scriptures. and their
[25:51] words seemed to them as idle tales
[25:55] and they believed them not.
[25:59] Then rose Peter and ran unto the suppler
[26:04] and stooping down, he behold the linen
[26:08] cloth
[26:10] laid by themselves, and departed
[26:13] wondering in himself
[26:15] at that which was come to pass. And
[26:19] behold, two of them went that same day
[26:23] to the village called Emmas, which was
[26:25] from Jerusalem about three
[26:29] uh score furloins. And they walked
[26:32] together
[26:34] of all these and they talked together of
[26:37] all these things which had happened. And
[26:42] it came to pass that while they communed
[26:46] together and reasoned, Jesus himself
[26:49] drew near and went with them, but their
[26:53] eyes were holden that they should not
[26:56] know him. And he said unto them, What
[26:59] manner of communications
[27:02] are these that ye have one to another as
[27:07] you walk and are sad? And one of them
[27:11] whose name was Cleopus answered and said
[27:13] unto him, "Art thou only a stranger
[27:18] in Jerusalem, and hath not known the
[27:21] things which are come to pass in these
[27:25] days?" You know, he was a stranger.
[27:28] Amen. But listen to the question.
[27:32] and and has not known these things which
[27:36] have come to pass in these days. And of
[27:42] course, Jesus then goes on and says,
[27:44] "What things?" And so, we're going to
[27:48] play 44 minutes. It's the end part of
[27:52] the message of
[27:56] uh modern events made clear by prophecy.
[28:01] in just 44 minutes. And if you can stay
[28:04] with that and we're going to start with
[28:07] the seventh verse and he says and uh the
[28:12] one verse 107
[28:14] and and this is the same thing that
[28:18] Jesus did with the disciples. Now listen
[28:22] now
[28:24] quickly.
[28:26] Don't miss this. Now here is the text
[28:31] how Jesus made himself known to these
[28:36] two disciples that he was their Messiah.
[28:41] Now all eyes this way.
[28:48] Now
[28:50] the prophet of God is when he talks
[28:53] about modern events, he never refers to
[28:57] politics.
[28:59] He never refers to science.
[29:02] He never refers to who was elected and
[29:05] who wasn't elected. He only refers to
[29:09] things like the moral condition of the
[29:12] day. What was to be made manifest in
[29:16] this day. Now, as we listen to this, the
[29:19] part that I'm hoping that comes alive to
[29:24] you is
[29:27] the two
[29:29] factors.
[29:31] And this is in verse one 143.
[29:36] It says, "There's not one thing in the
[29:40] Christian has in his armor that's
[29:43] scientific.
[29:47] Do you know that love, joy, peace,
[29:52] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[29:54] gentleness, patience, faith, Holy Ghost,
[29:58] everything is unseen by science.
[30:02] And that's the only thing that's real
[30:06] and lasting.
[30:09] Everything you look at that come from
[30:12] the earth goes back to the earth. Now
[30:18] listen to this statement.
[30:22] But the things that you can't see with
[30:26] your eyes
[30:29] but see it declare itself.
[30:34] That's the world of the
[30:38] eternal.
[30:40] And the prophet of God's laying out
[30:43] something here because our faith,
[30:47] when you look back 2,000 years ago, and
[30:51] you say Jesus Christ died on Calvary,
[30:54] your faith is in that history's correct.
[30:59] You believe what's being told you is
[31:02] true. George Washington crossed
[31:04] Delaware. Abraham Lincoln was the
[31:07] president. You have no evidence of that.
[31:10] But yet you believe it. You believe it
[31:13] is true. And because you believe it's
[31:16] true, your faith anchors there. That's
[31:18] one faith.
[31:20] But the faith that gives you power
[31:24] is the faith that you can see when
[31:27] something is made manifest. Now, right.
[31:32] And so he he he's going to end this
[31:36] sermon with if you believe this, if you
[31:39] believe this, if you believe this has
[31:41] come to pass, if you believe that come
[31:43] to pass, lay your hands over on one
[31:46] another. And if you truly believe it,
[31:51] it's finished. You'll get what you ask
[31:54] for. But I want you to understand where
[31:57] that he's looking for us to place our
[32:00] faith.
[32:01] And this is the same thing. Our path
[32:03] forward is to believe beyond a shadow of
[32:07] a doubt without question in our heart
[32:11] that this is the event that's made
[32:15] clear.
[32:17] This is what's been prophesied and this
[32:20] is what God's doing. Calling his bride
[32:23] out, separating her, bring her to the
[32:26] truth. I I really You believe this? You
[32:28] can go back and and listen. As brother
[32:31] Bram in the earlier parts of this
[32:34] message identifies several other
[32:36] ministries, he identifies the day. He
[32:39] identifies the time. But we're going to
[32:41] pick it up from here from 107. And I
[32:45] trust that that uh that you'll be
[32:48] blessed and and and when like I always
[32:52] thinks the best if he asks you to lay
[32:54] your hands on somebody, lay your hands
[32:56] on someone. He asks you to stand. Stand.
[32:59] Enter in to the tape and you'll receive
[33:03] the benefits of it. There's really
[33:05] something uh powerful here this evening.
[33:10] And I wish I had the words to get it
[33:13] across to you, but no one can get it
[33:16] across like the author. Amen. How many
[33:19] believe it's the author that'll speak
[33:21] that right? Lord richly bless you
[33:23] tonight. Father, bless our service
[33:24] tonight. 44 minutes. Father, we'll be
[33:27] out in about 1 hour. So, may we be
[33:30] steadfast and hold true with our hearts
[33:34] dedicated to hearing and asking you to
[33:37] speak to us that something unfolds to us
[33:41] and that our faith will become strong.
[33:44] For without it, Father, there's no way
[33:47] that we can please you. Without that
[33:49] rapturing faith, there's no way we can
[33:51] transform. We ask you to bless us now in
[33:55] Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[34:01] Now notice now quickly now don't miss
[34:04] this. Now here's the text
[34:08] how Jesus made himself known to these
[34:11] two disciples
[34:13] that he was their Messiah.
[34:18] Now all eyes this way
[34:23] and out in the land. Don't miss this.
[34:25] Now we've tried to tell you that the
[34:27] Bible is the word of God wrote by God
[34:30] himself through the lips and
[34:32] instrumentality of man. God can write
[34:34] himself.
[34:37] God can speak himself. God can do what
[34:40] he wants to. But he chose man to do it
[34:43] because the man that wrote it is part of
[34:46] God.
[34:48] So God wrote the Bible. The man didn't
[34:50] even know what they were writing in
[34:52] their own human thinking. They might
[34:54] disagree with it, but they wrote it.
[34:55] They couldn't. The Bible said, "Man of
[34:58] old, as they was moved by the Holy
[35:00] Ghost,
[35:03] God moved their hands, move their eyes
[35:06] into visions, they could say nothing but
[35:08] what they were looking at. They could
[35:09] speak nothing because he had full
[35:11] control of tongue, finger, every organ
[35:14] of the body was in full sway with God.
[35:17] No wonder the Bible said they were
[35:19] God's. They were a part of God. He was
[35:22] the fullness of God.
[35:26] Notice how Jesus the word made these two
[35:30] heartbroken disciples know he was their
[35:33] Messiah.
[35:35] The Messiah, the promised word. Notice
[35:38] what he done. He appealed to prophecy.
[35:44] Notice fools
[35:47] slow to believe all that the prophets
[35:49] wrote.
[35:52] Now he never said, "Oh, what what did
[35:55] the church say about it?"
[35:58] They had given the story. They know all
[36:00] the events that happened. They was all
[36:02] sad. They began to tell him, "Are you
[36:04] just a stranger here?
[36:06] or you don't know what's happened in
[36:07] Jerusalem. He said, "What things?" Like
[36:10] he didn't know.
[36:12] See, he does things sometimes to see
[36:14] what you'll do about it.
[36:16] Said, "What things? Who was it? What's
[36:18] happened? Are you just a stranger?" And
[36:21] talking right to the man that lived with
[36:22] for three and a half years and didn't
[36:24] know him.
[36:26] What things? What happened? Well, they
[36:29] said Jesus of Nazareth, which was a
[36:31] prophet, no doubt in our mind, he was
[36:35] mighty in word indeed before all the
[36:38] people. We've seen him do things that he
[36:41] was identified the prophet of God for
[36:43] this age. We know that. And we believe
[36:46] that he would be the redeemer, that he
[36:48] would redeem Israel. Then he turns and
[36:51] said, "You fools slow of heart to
[36:54] believe that all that the prophets said
[36:57] about him wouldn't come to pass."
[37:00] Watch him now. Go back to prophecy. What
[37:04] a rebuke for believers.
[37:07] Claim they believe him. Notice how he
[37:10] approached the subject. He never come
[37:12] right out and said, "I am your Messiah."
[37:16] He could have done it or he was. But
[37:19] notice, he identified himself in the
[37:22] word. Then they would know. If he'd have
[37:26] said it, he could have said that and it
[37:28] wouldn't have been so. But when he went
[37:31] and begin to speak on all the prophets
[37:33] said about him and they seen it, then
[37:35] they could tell themselves if they were
[37:38] God's children.
[37:41] but called their attention to what the
[37:43] prophets had foretold and said to look
[37:47] for in the time that the Messiah his age
[37:51] would be manifested.
[37:54] He as John let the word the Bible
[37:59] identify their message.
[38:02] any true prophet would do it.
[38:05] He didn't come out and say I'm he I'm
[38:08] that's not a true prophet.
[38:10] But he said go back in the scriptures.
[38:13] See he never fails his way of doing it.
[38:15] See he said uh we know Moses. He said if
[38:19] you would have known Moses you'd know
[38:21] me. He said Moses wrote on me. Said
[38:25] search the scripture in them you think
[38:26] you have eternal life and the scripture
[38:29] is what testifies of me.
[38:32] Go and look in the scripture and see it
[38:35] here. He never changes his way of doing
[38:37] it. Never has changed. He never can
[38:40] change because he's unchanging God. See,
[38:44] notice he went right back to these two
[38:46] disciples, Cleopus and his friend on the
[38:48] road to Emmas and said, "Appeal to the
[38:51] scriptures to him." Said, "Why are you
[38:53] so foolish to not to believe that every
[38:55] word the prophets wrote concerning
[38:57] Messiah would have to be fulfilled?"
[38:59] Oh, what a day. John did the same thing.
[39:03] Search the scriptures. Look back. Said
[39:06] there be a voice of one crying in the
[39:07] wilderness. Where did it come from?
[39:10] That's
[39:13] that should have made it plain to him,
[39:15] right? It should make it plain today.
[39:18] The thing that we see the Holy Spirit
[39:20] doing, he once said, "Search the
[39:22] scriptures."
[39:24] And we he wants us to do it today.
[39:26] Notice he began with Moses prophecy. The
[39:29] Bible says he beginning with Moses and
[39:32] all of the prophets. But he started with
[39:35] Moses, a prophet, said Moses, the Lord
[39:39] your God shall raise up among you
[39:43] people, among the people. The Lord God
[39:47] shall raise up a prophet. Now you might
[39:50] have said Cleopius
[39:52] and you're praying here did not Moses
[39:56] say
[39:57] that in these days the Lord God would
[40:00] raise up a prophet
[40:03] and this man that they crucified. Did he
[40:06] meet that qualification?
[40:10] Now Moses
[40:11] prophesied this and now you haven't had
[40:14] a prophet for hundreds and hundreds of
[40:16] years. And here this man raised up.
[40:21] And what was this man's forerunner? Did
[40:23] you say? Did it? And all the prophets
[40:26] said about him for his age. He spoke to
[40:30] him. It sure would have been interesting
[40:32] to listen at him. Wouldn't you like to
[40:34] heard him? I like to heard him to hear
[40:37] him what he said that the prophet said
[40:39] about himself.
[40:41] But he never said it was him. He just
[40:44] showed him a prophecy.
[40:46] He just said the prophet said this had
[40:48] happened. See,
[40:52] let's just go back a few minutes and now
[40:54] let's listen to the words quoted by
[40:57] himself.
[40:59] Watch here. The word itself quoting the
[41:03] word of himself.
[41:07] The word itself quoting the word of
[41:10] himself. Not telling that he was that,
[41:12] but just let the word speak for itself.
[41:15] And they know who he was. The letter of
[41:17] the word quoting the word in the word in
[41:20] flesh quoting the word of the letter
[41:22] being fully identified with himself.
[41:24] Look here. Now let's listen to him
[41:26] quote. How now we know that they were
[41:29] all brief of the late happenings that is
[41:31] of the crucifixion and of the story of
[41:33] the resurrection of the tomb as we just
[41:35] read. Now he goes straight to the word
[41:37] of prophecy about himself. Now let's
[41:39] just think that he said this. He said a
[41:41] lot more than this. But what let's say
[41:44] him hear him say, "Turn over to
[41:45] Zechariah 11 and 12." And wasn't the
[41:49] Messiah to be sold according to the
[41:52] prophet for 30 pieces of silver?
[41:56] You just said that this man was sold for
[41:57] 30 pieces of silver. Turn over. You get
[42:01] them scriptures. Zechariah 11:12. And
[42:04] then he said, did you notice what David
[42:08] said in the Psalms? Psalm 4:19,
[42:12] he was be betrayed by his friends.
[42:18] And then again in Zechariah 13:7, he was
[42:21] forsaken by his disciples.
[42:26] And in Psalms 35:11,
[42:28] accused by false witnesses. You just
[42:31] said he was.
[42:33] Isaiah 53:7, he was dumb before his
[42:37] accusers.
[42:40] Isaiah 50 and6 they scorged him. The
[42:45] prophet said
[42:48] Psalms 22 he was to cry on the cross my
[42:52] God my God why has thou forsaken me? Did
[42:54] he do that day before yesterday
[42:56] afternoon?
[42:58] Psalms 22 again 18 his garments was
[43:01] parted among them. Did they do that?
[43:07] And Psalms 22:78
[43:11] mocked by his enemies, the church.
[43:15] Psalms 22 again, there was not a bone in
[43:18] his body to be broke, but they pierced
[43:20] my hands and my feet. He said, holding
[43:24] his hands behind him, no doubt the time.
[43:27] Isaiah 53:12 said he would die between
[43:31] malifactors.
[43:34] Isaiah 53:9 said he was buried with the
[43:37] rich.
[43:40] Psalm 16:10 said, "I will not leave his
[43:45] soul in hell, neither will I suffer my
[43:47] holy one to see corruption."
[43:50] And was not Malachi 3, the forerunner of
[43:55] this man?
[43:58] Oh, I like you heard him quote that.
[44:01] Look at the prophecies. Notice then all
[44:04] the types he might have went through
[44:06] about Isaac in Genesis 22. How God
[44:10] foreshadowed Isaac, how father Abraham
[44:13] took his own son, packing the wood up
[44:15] the hill and offered up his own son. It
[44:18] was now beginning to soak into him.
[44:23] You done told them they were fools for
[44:25] not looking at the prophecy for that
[44:27] day. And now begin to soak in, begin to
[44:31] see the fulfilling of all this that had
[44:34] taken place in the last few days, in the
[44:37] last two or three years. The vindicated
[44:40] prophecy of the age. It was then
[44:44] that they knew that their crucified
[44:46] friend Jesus had fulfilled every word of
[44:49] this.
[44:52] Oh, it was then that they know that that
[44:55] man truly was that Messiah,
[44:58] that that he should raise from the dead.
[45:01] The grave couldn't hold him. I will not
[45:03] suffer my holy one to see corruption.
[45:06] There's not one word of prophecy can
[45:08] ever fail.
[45:12] And he did raise and that messengers
[45:14] down at the tomb this morning was right.
[45:18] He is risen from the dead.
[45:20] He is alive. He is that Messiah. Why?
[45:27] Don't feel it.
[45:30] His action, his ministry, and everything
[45:34] he's done has been vindicated. Exactly
[45:38] the words that the prophet said would
[45:39] take place for this day. That's done it.
[45:43] Then they know that it was him, their
[45:46] crucified friend Jesus, that had done
[45:48] it. No wonder their hearts burned within
[45:51] them as he talked to them.
[45:53] Now they'd walked six miles
[45:58] and it seemed like a short time. And
[46:01] here's another thing they had done. You
[46:04] know, they'd heard a six-hour sermon on
[46:06] prophecy
[46:09] being vindicated.
[46:12] That's what he talked to him along the
[46:13] road. Just soon as they started down the
[46:15] road, he stepped out for right there at
[46:17] Jerusalem. Six hours later later 64 long
[46:21] they was right down the road six miles
[46:23] to Emmas that's what it is and he had
[46:25] preached confirmed prophecy for six
[46:27] hours don't condemn me on my three then
[46:30] see but notice they had preached they
[46:32] had heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy
[46:35] being confirmed vindicated
[46:39] was getting along towards evening time
[46:43] you know he's the same yesterday day and
[46:45] forever
[46:47] it was and that he opened their eyes
[46:52] to know if Hebrews 13:8, he's the same
[46:55] yesterday, today, and forever
[47:00] at the evening time.
[47:05] Events are made clear
[47:08] by the prophecy. what's taking place in
[47:11] the modern hour can be easily identified
[47:14] if you'll just believe the prophecy of
[47:17] the hour. Yes. Fools
[47:20] slow of understanding,
[47:24] slow to believe. You keep pondering over
[47:27] it to believe that all the prophets said
[47:31] about the Messiah, wouldn't it have to
[47:33] happen? Now, he checked these points all
[47:36] back and showed what the prophet said
[47:38] that would happen.
[47:39] Then they begin to understand. So he
[47:43] said,
[47:45] uh, act like he's going to go on by.
[47:47] They like this man. They said, you you
[47:50] give us something. We never thought that
[47:52] he is alive somewhere is talking to him.
[47:56] Didn't know it.
[47:58] So he no doubt he looked at him sadly
[48:02] and he started to walk on by. But he is
[48:06] waiting for them to invite him. That's
[48:09] what he's waiting tonight.
[48:11] For you to invite him.
[48:15] Notice when those disciples invited him
[48:19] in to their fellowship
[48:22] around the table, it was then that he'd
[48:25] done something just like he did before
[48:27] his crucifixion.
[48:29] And their eyes come open.
[48:32] They noted his manner, his style. They
[48:35] know what he done. And he did it then
[48:38] just like he did before. And they said,
[48:40] "That's him." Amen. And quickly they
[48:43] raised up to scream it out and he
[48:45] vanished.
[48:48] Worried. It took six hours to listen to
[48:50] this sermon, maybe 20 minutes. They were
[48:51] lightfooted back to tell the rest of
[48:53] them, "He's risen indeed. He is really
[48:56] alive."
[48:58] Friends,
[49:00] this is the fulfillment of Malachi 4,
[49:05] St. Luke 17,
[49:08] St. John 15.
[49:10] Oh, so many Revelations 10. So many
[49:15] prophecies that can be pinned exactly to
[49:17] this day and also in the book of Mark
[49:21] and in Matthew where he said these great
[49:23] signs and wonders would appear in the
[49:25] sky and people call them saucers. Flying
[49:28] saucers
[49:30] can can vanish with the power and
[49:33] quickness of a thought.
[49:36] Intelligence that can move in. He can
[49:39] write, he can speak, he can do whatever
[49:42] he wants to. The great pillar of fire,
[49:44] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[49:47] And sights coming up on the earth,
[49:49] pyramids of smoke rising into the air
[49:51] way above where they cannot be, no
[49:53] humidity or nothing. 30 miles high.
[49:57] Amen. Predicted a year and a half before
[50:00] it happened that it would be that way.
[50:03] Then turn the picture and see who it is
[50:05] looking down.
[50:07] Not one word has ever failed that's been
[50:09] told. And here's God's written word
[50:12] confirming it's the truth.
[50:15] And it's evening time again. I wonder if
[50:18] he would return by grace tonight and do
[50:22] something now like he done back there.
[50:25] Let's pray and ask him.
[50:31] events
[50:32] made clear by vindicated prophecy.
[50:38] God Almighty,
[50:41] help us.
[50:43] Help us, dear God, to understand
[50:48] to understand
[50:51] the things that we should know.
[50:55] Understand thy word. And now, Lord,
[51:00] we have heard sermons now for nearly
[51:03] 2,000 years,
[51:06] writings of books, and in this last days
[51:09] here, it slipped right back again. And
[51:12] now it's towards evening time.
[51:16] The Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians,
[51:19] and many of them down through the ages
[51:21] talk with you. Maybe just along the way
[51:25] of this great day that hasn't been
[51:28] either night or day as the prophet said,
[51:31] but in the evening time it'll be like
[51:34] Jesus rose from the tomb and appeared to
[51:39] Simon to the women
[51:42] and showed them that he was alive. That
[51:45] was the morning and then in evening he
[51:47] come back again. But he did walk to them
[51:50] through the day rebuking them for their
[51:53] blindness. But then he made himself
[51:55] known to them in the evening time.
[51:58] God come into our fellowship tonight
[52:01] that we have around the word.
[52:04] God is so scarcely believed today
[52:07] amongst the peoples. But I'm thankful
[52:09] that there is some that you have called
[52:12] and ordained them to eternal life. And
[52:14] you said all that the father has given
[52:16] me will come. Now, while the evening
[52:19] lights are shining, while you have
[52:21] permitted, Lord, that not one prophecy
[52:24] out of the hundreds that went forth has
[52:26] ever failed one time.
[52:29] Then truly, if that identifies, it has
[52:32] to be you. Cause no person could be that
[52:34] accurate.
[52:36] Just like the Bible, no man could write.
[52:39] No one in the space of 1600 years by
[52:43] four, 40 different writers could write.
[52:46] and not one era be in it.
[52:50] Dear God, I pray that you will manifest
[52:52] yourself tonight of Hebrews 13:8 that
[52:54] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[52:56] forever. And the works that you did
[52:59] then, you do today. And you promised it.
[53:02] You said in this last days when the
[53:04] world is setting like Sodom and Gomorrah
[53:07] perversion, we look at these boys just
[53:10] so much like girls wearing clothes like
[53:14] them and and see the girls trying to act
[53:17] like boys and see the women and men in
[53:20] this perverted age. See sex appeal has
[53:24] become a a idol of worship.
[53:28] The gospel has been pushed out to one
[53:30] side and nakedness in the Lady of Caia
[53:33] church.
[53:35] Oh God, what an hour.
[53:38] Come Lord Jesus, make yourself known to
[53:42] us. Why we asked it in Jesus' name. Now
[53:46] while you have your heads bound,
[53:50] your eyes closed,
[53:52] I'm going to ask you something.
[53:57] You believe that God is here. You
[53:59] believe that the things it's doing today
[54:02] is prophecy fulfilled. You believe that
[54:05] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[54:07] today, and forever. You believe when he
[54:09] was sure manifest in the flesh for that
[54:11] day and the works that he done there was
[54:14] to be repeated again in this day. The
[54:16] prophets said so. The Bible said so. All
[54:20] scripture must be fulfilled. It cannot
[54:22] fail. How did he identify himself? By
[54:25] being that prophet that Moses spoke of.
[54:28] Know the secrets of the hearts of the
[54:30] people. The woman touched his garment.
[54:32] He turned and said, "Thy faith has saved
[54:35] thee." When Simon Peter come up to him,
[54:38] he knowed his name, told him who he was,
[54:39] who his father was.
[54:42] That same lovely Jesus is not dead. He's
[54:45] alive forever more. Praise be to God.
[54:48] And I believe in this evening time now,
[54:50] he's called us together again. Oh Lord
[54:53] Jesus, come among us. Don't pass us by.
[54:56] Come stay all night with us till this
[54:58] night is over. Then let us go with you
[55:00] tomorrow.
[55:02] We might know you in the power of your
[55:05] resurrection. That your love and grace
[55:07] and mercy might be with us.
[55:10] Oh eternal God, grant these things.
[55:15] We know that only God alone can grant
[55:19] them
[55:25] the solemnness of this hour. Let us say
[55:28] this, God our father,
[55:32] our flesh is a poor tabernacle for you.
[55:36] But Lord, let your sanctifying grace,
[55:39] your holy spirit come now. Cleanse us
[55:41] from every doubt and ever flusteration.
[55:44] every suspicion
[55:47] and every line of skepticism that would
[55:51] be in us that we might be free without
[55:54] one doubt. Come out, confess boldly like
[55:57] Peter, thou art the Christ.
[56:01] The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[56:03] We believe that thy word is truth. Lord,
[56:06] let us just see before we start this
[56:09] prayer line, Lord, and make yourself
[56:11] known to us. As you said, as it was in
[56:14] the days of Lot when Abraham, that
[56:17] called out group waiting for a promised
[56:20] son,
[56:22] Lot was down there. You're in a modern
[56:24] Billy Graham and an or Roberts to that
[56:26] denominational setup down there as a
[56:28] nation. But Abraham was a souljourner
[56:32] without any organization.
[56:35] just this little group wandering about
[56:38] through the land that he was to heir and
[56:40] the meek shall inherit the earth.
[56:44] One day under the shade tree while they
[56:47] were sitting resting,
[56:49] God came down in a form of a man. Two
[56:52] angels went down into Sodom and God in
[56:56] human flesh proved that he was he
[56:59] said,"Abraham,
[57:01] where is thy wife Sarah?" A few days
[57:04] before that, he was Abram.
[57:07] And s a r a Sarah, not Sarah, prince.
[57:12] And you called her by her prince's name,
[57:15] the daughter of a king. You called
[57:18] Abraham by his name, Abraham, a father
[57:22] of nations.
[57:24] And you said, I am going to visit you.
[57:28] God, how that prophet's heart must have
[57:30] jumped. He knowed who you was right
[57:32] then.
[57:34] No wonder he washed your feet, brought
[57:37] out all the food that he had in the very
[57:39] best, laid it before you. He knew that
[57:43] was God there.
[57:45] Then he said, "Where is Sarah?" As if he
[57:48] didn't know. And you, Abraham, said to
[57:52] him, "He's in the tent. She's in the
[57:55] tent behind you." And you said what was
[57:57] going to happen? And she in her heart
[58:00] doubted it.
[58:02] And then you you said to Abraham, "Why
[58:05] did Sarah doubt that? Saying in her
[58:08] heart, these things can't be. Is
[58:09] anything too hard for God?"
[58:12] Oh, God.
[58:14] Jesus
[58:16] manifested God of the word. You said as
[58:19] it was in the days of Sodom, the world
[58:22] would be in that condition just before
[58:24] the destruction of the gentile world,
[58:26] the gentile dispensation. Here we are,
[58:29] Sodommites to the core.
[58:31] And then you said
[58:34] that the son of man, which is always
[58:36] referred to as a prophet, would be
[58:39] revealed in that hour.
[58:42] Fulfill thy words, oh God.
[58:45] We your believing children wait with
[58:47] sincere hearts to give us faith. Lord,
[58:50] that when we have the prayer line, the
[58:52] people will believe.
[58:54] It's evening time. Father, let the
[58:56] evening lights of the son of God, he
[59:00] that was and which is and shall come,
[59:04] manifest himself by the prophecy that
[59:06] he's made in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[59:11] I am now ready to to pray for the sick.
[59:16] But it's a strange thing
[59:19] how that when we stand here
[59:23] I stand here now making a challenge to
[59:26] the public and hooked up across the
[59:28] nation
[59:31] that God still is God.
[59:37] He cannot fail.
[59:41] And what he promises that he'll do,
[59:45] he'll never fail to do it. For he
[59:48] promised to do it.
[59:51] Therefore, I can place solemn confidence
[59:56] in what he said.
[59:59] Therefore, I look
[1:00:01] for his coming. I look for him to appear
[1:00:04] at any time. because he said in an hour
[1:00:07] that you think not, the world thinks
[1:00:09] not. Then he'll appear.
[1:00:12] Now, so far as I know, I'm in my
[1:00:14] tabernacle here.
[1:00:17] And there's a few people sitting here
[1:00:19] that I I do know,
[1:00:22] brother, right? A few of these sitting
[1:00:24] here that right along here I do know,
[1:00:26] but there's many of you I do not know.
[1:00:31] And I have no way of saying that God
[1:00:35] will do this
[1:00:37] tonight. We have seen him do it for the
[1:00:40] past years and years, but he might not
[1:00:44] do it tonight. I don't know.
[1:00:47] That's up to him. He's sovereign. He
[1:00:49] does what he wishes to. No one can tell
[1:00:51] him what to do. He abides alone in his
[1:00:55] will and his ways. But because that he
[1:00:58] promised it, I'm asking him to do it.
[1:01:03] Not for our sake that we need it, but
[1:01:05] maybe for some stranger's sake that the
[1:01:08] Holy Spirit might be anointed. Now,
[1:01:10] anointing upon us. Now, no matter how
[1:01:13] much he anoints me, he's got to anoint
[1:01:15] you, too.
[1:01:17] Certainly, to believe. Now, I want to
[1:01:21] have a prayer line, and I want to pray
[1:01:24] for the sick as much as I can. Now, we
[1:01:26] can either have a line to call the
[1:01:30] people and bring them up here, a prayer
[1:01:34] line, and pray for everybody here that's
[1:01:37] sick. I suppose have my minister
[1:01:39] brothers to come here with us and lay
[1:01:41] hands up on you. We can sure do that. Or
[1:01:44] either we can ask our father, who is the
[1:01:48] only one that could do anything for you
[1:01:51] because my hands are just a man like
[1:01:54] you, man.
[1:01:56] But the thing of it is it isn't the
[1:01:57] human hand that does it. It's the word
[1:02:00] of God.
[1:02:02] Faith in that word is what does it. No
[1:02:05] scientific thing about it's all together
[1:02:07] unscientific.
[1:02:09] There's not one thing the Christian has
[1:02:11] in his armor that's scientific. Do you
[1:02:14] know that?
[1:02:16] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:02:19] goodness, meekness, gentleness,
[1:02:21] patience, faith, Holy Ghost. Everything
[1:02:25] is unseen by science. And that's the
[1:02:28] only thing that's real and lasting.
[1:02:31] Everything you look at come from the
[1:02:32] earth and goes back to the earth. But
[1:02:34] the things that you can't see with your
[1:02:36] eye, but see it declare itself, that's
[1:02:38] the world of eternal.
[1:02:43] Would you believe if God would manifest
[1:02:45] himself and show that he is here alive
[1:02:49] doing the same things that he did at the
[1:02:51] beginning after this message, would you
[1:02:53] accept it as your healing?
[1:02:57] May God grant it. Now, I'm asking
[1:03:00] anybody in the house,
[1:03:04] no matter who you are or where you're
[1:03:07] from,
[1:03:08] I'm asking you just to solemnly believe
[1:03:11] this message to be the truth. That is
[1:03:13] the message that God has in his Bible
[1:03:15] for this hour. That Jesus Christ is sure
[1:03:18] tonight and is a lie. Now, nearly all
[1:03:22] you people know of me, I'm right here in
[1:03:24] a town where it's raised up. I don't
[1:03:26] even have a grammar school education.
[1:03:29] That's exactly true.
[1:03:33] And you've known me long enough. I hope
[1:03:36] I've lived before to show you that I'm
[1:03:38] honest and sincere. I'm not a hypocrite.
[1:03:41] Even my critics don't say that. They
[1:03:42] they say you're you're not a hypocrite,
[1:03:45] but you're just simply wrong.
[1:03:51] You're just ignorantly wrong. Not
[1:03:54] willfully.
[1:03:56] I don't think
[1:03:58] that I'm ignorantly wrong because the
[1:04:00] word of God testifies of my message.
[1:04:04] It should tell you who it is. Yes. And
[1:04:07] you clearly hear me say it isn't me. So
[1:04:10] then it has to be him.
[1:04:14] Is that right?
[1:04:19] Have faith in God. Then look this away
[1:04:22] and you believe God.
[1:04:27] If you can believe God, God will grant
[1:04:29] to you. If he can do that like he did
[1:04:32] before, then he's still God.
[1:04:36] You believe that?
[1:04:42] You believe it?
[1:04:44] Lady sitting here before me looking at
[1:04:46] me, tears in her eyes, sincerely. I
[1:04:48] don't know who she is. ever seen her?
[1:04:51] I'm a stranger to you.
[1:04:54] You think God knows the secret of your
[1:04:57] heart,
[1:04:58] your desires or your sin or whatever it
[1:05:02] is. You think he knows?
[1:05:05] You think he could reveal to me what
[1:05:07] your sin is,
[1:05:09] what you've done, what you ought not
[1:05:11] have done, or your desire, whatever it
[1:05:14] is, if he had do it, would it make you
[1:05:16] believe him? Know that it has to be him?
[1:05:18] Would you accept it as him?
[1:05:21] It's not your sin that's bothering you.
[1:05:23] You've confessed that, but you're
[1:05:25] wanting the baptism of his Holy Spirit.
[1:05:29] You shall receive it.
[1:05:36] I see it move down across her.
[1:05:40] That you might know that I was looking
[1:05:42] at the woman. She's looking at me. I
[1:05:44] want to show you the Holy Spirit. Look
[1:05:47] here. right over this little woman
[1:05:48] sitting here down beneath my feet here.
[1:05:51] When I said that, that's the same thing
[1:05:53] she wants is the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:55] Ghost. You believe it, you will receive
[1:05:57] it. Sister, raise up your hand.
[1:06:03] I have never seen the woman in my life
[1:06:05] knowing.
[1:06:10] See this man sitting here with his head
[1:06:11] down, sitting right there at his collar
[1:06:13] misfitting him and so forth. He suffered
[1:06:15] with a bladder trouble. You believe that
[1:06:17] God will make you well?
[1:06:20] Raise up your hand if you'll accept it.
[1:06:22] All right. God grant you your request.
[1:06:27] This young man sitting right here
[1:06:29] wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:32] You believe God will give it to you,
[1:06:34] sir, with your white string tie hanging
[1:06:36] back. God will grant it. This man here
[1:06:39] is praying for his wife.
[1:06:42] She's in an institution.
[1:06:44] You believe that God will heal her, make
[1:06:46] her well. You believe it, you can have
[1:06:49] it
[1:06:51] with your hand up to your throat.
[1:06:54] You believe that God can heal that heart
[1:06:56] condition that's bothering you, that
[1:06:58] stomach trouble that you have. You're
[1:07:00] sitting there suffering right now. Is
[1:07:02] that right?
[1:07:04] You believe he heals you
[1:07:07] and you can have it.
[1:07:10] Amen.
[1:07:13] You see, he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:07:14] and forever. Ask those people. See if I
[1:07:17] know them. I don't, but he does. Amen.
[1:07:26] See that light on the side of the waller
[1:07:30] hanging right down over a man sitting
[1:07:31] there? He's suffering with a spinal
[1:07:34] condition in his back.
[1:07:38] He's not from here. He's from Georgia.
[1:07:44] Mr. Duncan,
[1:07:46] believe with all your heart. God will
[1:07:48] heal that back trouble. You believe with
[1:07:50] all your heart.
[1:07:52] God bless you.
[1:07:59] There's a man sitting way back here with
[1:08:02] back trouble looking at me. I don't know
[1:08:05] him, but it's Mr. Thompson. You believe?
[1:08:08] Raise up, sir, back there. Lord, I'm a
[1:08:11] stranger to you. That's right. But
[1:08:13] you're sitting there praying. Your back
[1:08:15] troubles heal now. Jesus Christ makes
[1:08:18] you well.
[1:08:20] It shall be light just about the evening
[1:08:23] time. Don't you see? He's here tonight.
[1:08:27] He's a great I am. He's the same
[1:08:29] yesterday and forever. Do you believe
[1:08:31] it?
[1:08:34] Are you satisfied and convinced that
[1:08:36] this is Jesus Christ making himself
[1:08:39] known, identifying himself in prophecy?
[1:08:46] Don't worry about the eye.
[1:08:50] God heals the sick and the afflicted.
[1:08:54] How many people How many's in your sick?
[1:08:56] Let's see your hands. Just seems like
[1:08:58] it's such a pull and a strain.
[1:09:01] Have any of you people got prayer cards?
[1:09:05] I don't know how I'd get you through
[1:09:06] here. I want to pray for you and I don't
[1:09:08] know how to do it. You see what? Look at
[1:09:10] the wall. How am I going to get them in
[1:09:11] there? Why? If you get one out of jail,
[1:09:12] you got the other blocked right there.
[1:09:14] Everybody stop still.
[1:09:16] Listen.
[1:09:18] Hear me. Have I ever told you anything
[1:09:21] in the name of the Lord? But what come
[1:09:22] to pass?
[1:09:26] Is that right? Everything has always
[1:09:28] been right. I've never asked you for one
[1:09:31] penny of money in my life, have I? Not
[1:09:33] one time. Never took an offering in my
[1:09:35] life. I'm not here for money.
[1:09:38] I'm not here to deceive you. I'm here to
[1:09:42] manifest
[1:09:44] God's word of the hour. I've told you
[1:09:47] the truth, and God has testified that it
[1:09:49] is the truth. Now I tell you, thus saith
[1:09:53] the scriptures,
[1:09:55] that if the believer lays his hands upon
[1:10:00] the sick,
[1:10:01] Jesus said, they shall recover. Do you
[1:10:05] believe that? Then in the presence of
[1:10:09] God,
[1:10:13] don't you believe he'll do it right now?
[1:10:16] Now, put your hands on one another and
[1:10:18] just hold it there for a minute. Now
[1:10:20] don't don't pray. Just put your hands on
[1:10:22] one another out there in the land. And
[1:10:25] me myself, I'm laying myself over these
[1:10:28] handkerches.
[1:10:30] Now I want you to look at me just a
[1:10:32] minute.
[1:10:34] What has God left undone?
[1:10:38] Look how he's what the word that we have
[1:10:41] read the prophecies that we have told
[1:10:43] that Jesus identified himself by the
[1:10:45] prophecies.
[1:10:47] Now look at the hour and these last
[1:10:49] three weeks where we have placed the
[1:10:52] hour that we're living. Look at what we
[1:10:55] have read. How about the false prophets
[1:10:57] and almost signs that would deceive the
[1:10:59] elected. How the word has been
[1:11:01] manifested. How the God of this age has
[1:11:04] blinded the li hearts of the people. And
[1:11:06] how the God himself has said through his
[1:11:09] prophecies that these things would take
[1:11:11] place in this Leosa age.
[1:11:15] There's nothing left undone.
[1:11:19] God is sure just the same God that
[1:11:24] talked to those people on Emmas that
[1:11:26] identified himself
[1:11:28] by the prophecies that was foretold of
[1:11:31] him. He's here tonight identifying his
[1:11:34] presence by the prophecies foretold for
[1:11:37] this age. He's the same yesterday,
[1:11:40] today, and forever. Can you believe it?
[1:11:44] Then lay your hands upon one another.
[1:11:46] Don't pray for yourself, but in your own
[1:11:48] way pray for that person that you got
[1:11:50] your hands on because they are praying
[1:11:52] for you. Now look, don't doubt.
[1:11:56] And I if you could see what I'm looking
[1:11:58] at,
[1:12:01] you know, I wouldn't lie to you stand
[1:12:02] here.
[1:12:05] If you could see and your faith could
[1:12:07] draw that great holy spirit that sailed
[1:12:12] yonder in the air that science has took
[1:12:15] pictures of and see it moving through
[1:12:18] this building just trying to find a
[1:12:20] place to to land trying to find an
[1:12:24] anchor place
[1:12:26] only believe it my brother
[1:12:29] he's identified it by scripture and so
[1:12:32] forth that it's right now pray a
[1:12:34] sincerity for that person you got your
[1:12:36] hands on. They're praying for you,
[1:12:40] dear Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:12:43] While we are conscious, Lord, by the
[1:12:45] word that you're here, by the promise
[1:12:48] that you're here. Wherever two or three
[1:12:51] are gathered in my name, there I am in
[1:12:54] the midst of them.
[1:12:56] And these signs will follow them that
[1:12:58] believe. If they lay their hands on the
[1:13:01] sick, they shall recover out over the
[1:13:04] waves of this telephone. May the great
[1:13:07] Holy Spirit go into every congregation.
[1:13:11] May the same holy light that we look at
[1:13:14] right here in the church, may it fall
[1:13:16] upon each and everyone and may they be
[1:13:19] healed at this time. We rebuke the
[1:13:23] enemy, the devil in the presence of
[1:13:26] Christ. We say to the enemy that he is
[1:13:30] defeated by the the vicarious
[1:13:35] sufferings, the death of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:38] and the triumph resurrection on the
[1:13:41] third day and his proven evidence that
[1:13:45] he's here among us tonight alive after
[1:13:48] 1900 years. Let the spirit of the living
[1:13:52] God fill every heart with faith and
[1:13:56] power and healing virtue from the
[1:13:59] resurrection of Jesus Christ who is
[1:14:02] identified now by this great light
[1:14:05] circling the church in his presence
[1:14:08] in the name of Jesus Christ. Grant for
[1:14:12] the glory of God. May these handkerches
[1:14:15] that we pray over,
[1:14:18] may they go to the sick and the
[1:14:20] afflicted that they're attended to, may
[1:14:22] the same Holy Spirit that's here now
[1:14:25] identifying himself, identify himself on
[1:14:28] every patient that these is laid upon.
[1:14:32] May the presence of God so fill their
[1:14:34] heart with faith until the sickness of
[1:14:36] their body will be healed.
[1:14:39] This we ask for the glory of God in the
[1:14:42] presence of Jesus Christ and in the name
[1:14:44] of Jesus Christ
[1:14:48] as we the servants of Jesus Christ asked
[1:14:50] it. Amen. Amen. Now from your hearts, I
[1:14:57] don't care what was wrong with you.
[1:15:00] Can you from your heart believe with all
[1:15:02] your heart that the word of God has
[1:15:05] granted you your request?
[1:15:09] I believe that every hand as I could see
[1:15:12] went up. If you believe it, now remember
[1:15:17] it is finished.
[1:15:21] You out there on the telephone wires. If
[1:15:24] you have believed with all your heart as
[1:15:26] the ministers are laying hands up on you
[1:15:28] and the loved ones laying hands up on
[1:15:30] you, if you believe with all your heart
[1:15:32] that it's finished,
[1:15:34] it's finished. The great Holy Spirit is
[1:15:37] here in the tabernacle tonight. I seen
[1:15:39] him move over the people. Showed himself
[1:15:42] over here on the side of a wall and went
[1:15:44] down upon a man. Come down here and up
[1:15:47] through the building making known the
[1:15:49] secrets of the hearts. The
[1:15:50] identification of his presence to show
[1:15:52] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:15:55] forever. He is in our midst. He's God,
[1:15:58] the never failing God. And did not our
[1:16:01] hearts burn within us? And does not it
[1:16:03] burn now to know that we are now in the
[1:16:07] presence of the resurrected Jesus
[1:16:09] Christ. To whom be glory and praise
[1:16:13] forever more, who is in the express
[1:16:16] image of the Almighty Jehovah, who
[1:16:19] sailed down in a form of a pillar of
[1:16:22] fire in a burning bush to attract the
[1:16:23] attention of a prophet, who had
[1:16:25] descended upon the mountain, and anyone
[1:16:28] that even touched it was to be killed
[1:16:30] besides Moses and Joshua. How did it was
[1:16:34] that he led the children of Israel
[1:16:35] through the wilderness in their journey
[1:16:37] as a type of the calledout people today.
[1:16:43] Here he is by scientific research even
[1:16:46] identified himself before science and by
[1:16:48] his very actions and by his very
[1:16:50] prophecy. The things that's prophesied
[1:16:53] of him to do in this day to make him the
[1:16:55] same yesterday, today and forever has
[1:16:58] been perfectly vindicated.
[1:17:01] Isn't it enough to make our hearts burn
[1:17:04] within us?
[1:17:06] God bless you. Now with one accord,
[1:17:09] let's stand and say, I now accept Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ as savior and healer
[1:17:19] and by his grace
[1:17:21] from this hour henceforth this hour. Oh
[1:17:25] God, Oh God, let no unbelief Let no
[1:17:29] unbelief ever enter my heart ever enter
[1:17:32] my heart. For I have seen For I have
[1:17:34] seen the prophecy the prophecy of this
[1:17:37] day of this day fulfilled fulfilled. I
[1:17:41] believe I believe that Jesus Christ that
[1:17:43] Jesus Christ is alive is alive. And here
[1:17:46] now and here now confirming his word
[1:17:49] confirming his word of this hour of this
[1:17:52] hour. The prophecies The prophecies that
[1:17:55] was written of him that was written of
[1:17:57] him has now been fulfilled in our midst.
[1:17:59] has now been fulfilled in our midst. He
[1:18:01] is my savior. He is my God. My God. My
[1:18:05] king. My king. My all and all. My all
[1:18:08] and all.
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:22] I just hope
[1:18:25] that somehow that the great revelation
[1:18:29] of faith
[1:18:31] and where faith is placed faith final
[1:18:35] resting place is the word of God.
[1:18:39] And he let's read this one quote again
[1:18:44] friends this is the fulfillment of
[1:18:48] Malachi 4
[1:18:51] St. Luke 17
[1:18:53] St. John 15 and oh so many Revelations
[1:18:59] 10:7
[1:19:00] so many prophecies that can be pinned
[1:19:03] exactly to this day and also the book of
[1:19:07] Mark and in Matthew where he said these
[1:19:10] great signs and wonders would appear in
[1:19:13] the sky and people call them saucers.
[1:19:16] Flying saucers can vanish with power and
[1:19:20] quickness of a thought. intellect that
[1:19:24] can move in.
[1:19:26] He can write. He can speak. He can do
[1:19:28] whatever he wants. The great pillar of
[1:19:31] fire, the same yesterday, ever. The
[1:19:34] signs coming up of the earth. Pyramid of
[1:19:38] smoke rising into the air way above
[1:19:42] where there cannot be no humidity or
[1:19:44] nothing. 30 miles high. Predicted a year
[1:19:48] and a half before it happened that it
[1:19:51] would be that way. Then turn the picture
[1:19:54] and see who's looking down. Not one word
[1:19:58] has ever failed that's been told. And
[1:20:01] here is God's written word confirming
[1:20:05] its truth. And it's evening time again.
[1:20:09] I wonder if he would return by grace
[1:20:12] tonight and do something now he done
[1:20:15] back there. Let us ask him. Events made
[1:20:18] clear by prophecy.
[1:20:22] And then as you begin to see him
[1:20:26] un unfold
[1:20:28] and and preach, he comes back, if I
[1:20:32] could find it here,
[1:20:34] and he he makes a
[1:20:38] he makes so many wonderful statements
[1:20:42] about
[1:20:45] how that God's resting place is the word
[1:20:49] of God for this day.
[1:20:52] And and so so many times
[1:20:56] we try to get everybody to look back
[1:21:00] 2,000 years and place their faith on
[1:21:04] something that happened 2,000 years ago.
[1:21:08] And that's faith in the history of what
[1:21:11] he did then.
[1:21:13] But the the faith that gives us power
[1:21:17] is the faith that allows us to see him
[1:21:21] in the day that we're living. Amen. To
[1:21:25] see him in the prophecies that were
[1:21:28] spoken of for our day. All the world out
[1:21:32] there believes the prophecies for
[1:21:35] another day.
[1:21:38] But he made this statement. When you
[1:21:42] believe this message, this is how that
[1:21:45] you know you're the child of God.
[1:21:48] That's right. And that we we've got to
[1:21:51] have faith. Now, no matter how much he
[1:21:53] anoints me, the prophet of God said,
[1:21:56] he's got to anoint you in perfect faith.
[1:21:59] He says, you've got to know that you are
[1:22:02] a believer. Amen. And that what you're
[1:22:05] believing in is true. Right? And this is
[1:22:08] what he's trying to point out to us. The
[1:22:10] power of our faith is believing what God
[1:22:15] is doing now.
[1:22:19] And we could go from that and he asked
[1:22:21] us, do you believe that?
[1:22:23] Do you believe that the prophecies were
[1:22:25] fulfilled to this day? Do you believe it
[1:22:27] with all your heart? Not because your
[1:22:30] husband believed it. Not because your
[1:22:32] marriage has gone that way. Not because
[1:22:34] you're raised in church. If you can
[1:22:36] believe it because it's been made known
[1:22:39] to you and you know it's absolutely
[1:22:45] the truth. Prophecy fulfilled.
[1:22:50] Every believer for every age had to
[1:22:54] believe the prophecy for that age. Thou
[1:22:57] art the Christ, the son of the living
[1:23:00] God. Flesh and blood didn't reveal this
[1:23:03] to you, but my father which is in heaven
[1:23:05] has revealed to this. Upon this rock
[1:23:08] I'll build my church. And now he comes
[1:23:11] in this day, does the same thing and
[1:23:15] looks to us. He says, I've challenged
[1:23:17] you.
[1:23:18] Do you believe that this in this day was
[1:23:23] none other than Jesus Christ himself
[1:23:26] veiled in the ministry of a prophet
[1:23:29] doing the same thing. If you have faith
[1:23:32] in that, then you have faith in the word
[1:23:34] for the hour and you receive the power
[1:23:37] that comes and the anointing that comes
[1:23:41] with that hour. And I just trust that
[1:23:45] it's a blessing. Now, I believe with all
[1:23:47] my heart I I was in service
[1:23:51] and brother Bram said, "If you believe
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:55] and you lay your hands on the person
[1:23:59] you're praying for and you believe it,
[1:24:03] you'll get what you asked for."
[1:24:07] And I I've been praying for this for
[1:24:09] years because I believed it in all my
[1:24:12] heart. I've I've gotten so tired of
[1:24:17] having somebody come up for prayer and
[1:24:20] me telling them if you believe
[1:24:25] if you believe. But in this tape he said
[1:24:28] if I believe
[1:24:32] if I believe the word of God for the
[1:24:35] hour.
[1:24:38] If I believe these prophecies
[1:24:41] have come to pass, if I believe this is
[1:24:45] the truth, unadulterated truth. If I
[1:24:48] believe it was Jesus Christ, the same
[1:24:51] yesterday, today, and forever, declaring
[1:24:55] himself in things unseen, the the the
[1:24:59] the world of the supernatural, if I
[1:25:02] believe it,
[1:25:05] I can have
[1:25:08] what I asked for.
[1:25:12] And then if the love and humility of God
[1:25:15] is there where I wouldn't ask for myself
[1:25:17] that it would be consumed upon my own
[1:25:20] lust that I could pray based on what God
[1:25:25] has revealed to me and have what I asked
[1:25:29] for. I hope that settles in. church is
[1:25:33] burning within me that and I'll preach
[1:25:37] on that Sunday. I believe that that's
[1:25:40] the quickening power that God is going
[1:25:43] to give this church. Amen. Do you love
[1:25:46] him tonight? Do you believe you got what
[1:25:49] you asked for? Let us bow our heads. Our
[1:25:52] gracious heavenly father, Lord, what a
[1:25:55] wonderful message. What a wonderful
[1:25:57] revelation. Father, may that revelation
[1:26:00] grow in each of us, Father. May it sink
[1:26:03] in. I I loved how our prophet said. He
[1:26:06] said, "It begin to soak in." Father,
[1:26:09] sometimes it takes a six-hour sermon for
[1:26:12] it to soak in. Father, may it start
[1:26:16] soaking in where our faith lies in this
[1:26:20] day.
[1:26:22] The faith of the believer in this d day
[1:26:25] lies in the fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:26:29] for this day. Oh God, may it soak in.
[1:26:34] May it produce life. May it produce
[1:26:37] understanding. May it produce a power in
[1:26:40] a church with character that doesn't
[1:26:42] want these great things that they might
[1:26:45] consume it upon their own lives, Father,
[1:26:47] but they would want it for others,
[1:26:50] Father. as you said, let this mind be in
[1:26:52] you that was in Christ Jesus that we
[1:26:55] look upon every other's needs greater
[1:26:58] than ourselves, Father, and that that
[1:27:00] real love would be shed abroad in our
[1:27:02] hearts by the Holy Spirit. We ask you to
[1:27:05] bless us now this evening as we have
[1:27:09] brother Billy come to sing a song of
[1:27:11] dismissal and praise. Father, may the
[1:27:14] people go from here knowing that their
[1:27:17] what they've asked for is done not by
[1:27:20] feeling, not by anointing, but by the
[1:27:24] word of God. We ask it in Jesus' name.
[1:27:28] Amen. God bless you, brother Billy.
[1:27:31] Dismiss of the song in prayer, please.
[1:27:49] You are my strength when I am weak.
[1:27:54] You are the treasure that I seek. You
[1:27:59] are my ally.
