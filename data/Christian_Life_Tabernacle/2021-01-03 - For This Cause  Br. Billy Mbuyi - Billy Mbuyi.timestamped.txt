[45:20] will come out those that are streaming
[45:22] if could maybe set that uh day out for
[45:26] you that Saturday of that weekend and
[45:28] may US Brothers can start get together

[45:33] can do also I believe it's this Sunday
[45:36] next Sunday Rebecca you'll be taking
[45:39] pictures yes we're going to start taking
[45:41] pictures of the directory so uh now I
[45:45] don't particularly want my picture
[45:48] upgraded because it's several years old
[45:51] and I like that part of it but uh you
[45:54] know if you've added family members or
[45:57] you aren't in the directory uh uh then
[46:01] it would be nice if we could get your
[46:02] photograph and put it in there because I
[46:05] go try to go back and see who you
[46:08] are you know oh this is such and such
[46:11] and this is such and such and and it's
[46:14] good for me but it's also good for you
[46:17] so you can reach out to one another and
[46:19] have that so that's what it's there for
[46:22] it's there for a fellowship uh tool so
[46:26] we certainly uh want you to get your
[46:29] directory and and then if you your
[46:32] information's not correct and we'll try
[46:35] to make it available to you and um you
[46:38] can download it and all the

[53:03] life and father the scripture says that
[53:05] the word was the light of man it was
[53:08] life and the light of man and and them
[53:10] that receive it to them you've given the

[53:17] give it to us once again let us receive
[53:19] of your word for as we eat it we become
[53:22] it Lord bless us bless our fellowship we
[53:25] ask these things in the name of the Lord
[53:26] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God
[53:30] bless you tonight
[53:33] amen amen good to be Gather in the house
[53:35] of God let's uh open our Bibles uh we
[53:40] try not going to try to be too long
[53:42] tonight and just a few moments
[53:46] uh uh John chapter 18
[53:59] we're going to read verse
[54:01] 37 from 37
[54:10] to let's just start at 37 it says and
[54:14] Bot therefore said unto him how are th
[54:18] King how are thou a king then Jesus
[54:22] answered thou sayest that I am a king
[54:27] to this end I was born for this cause I
[54:31] came into the world that I should bear
[54:35] witness unto unto the truth everyone
[54:39] that is of the truth heareth my my voice
[54:43] I mean it's very specific to who his
[54:46] subjects were and those that will
[54:49] actually recognize him as
[54:52] king and it says in 38 pilate said unto
[54:55] him what is truth and when he had said
[54:59] to this he went out again unto the Jews
[55:03] and he said unto them I found in him no
[55:06] fault at all amen let's also turn again
[55:09] and uh same uh uh John chapter
[55:19] 12 and verse 27 just one scripture
[55:23] reading it says now my soul
[55:27] is trouble now my soul
[55:29] troubleth and what shall I say father
[55:32] save me from this
[55:34] hour for this cause I came I came unto
[55:38] this hour amen may the Lord add the
[55:40] blessing through the reading of his word
[55:42] you may have your seats let's also turn
[55:45] as you as you seated in first
[55:47] John uh chapter
[55:50] 3 1 John chapter
[55:54] 3 uh we're going to read read from verse
[55:58] 5 it
[56:01] says it says and know ye
[56:05] not and know and know ye and ye know
[56:08] that he was manifested to take away our
[56:11] sins and in him and in and in him is no
[56:16] sin whatsoever abideth in him sinth not
[56:21] whatsoever sinth had not sin him neither
[56:25] knoweth him so the the knowledge of sin
[56:29] and the abiding of sin is directly
[56:31] connected to the knowledge of him and he
[56:35] says little children let no man deceive
[56:38] you he that doeth righteousness is
[56:42] righteous even he even as he is
[56:47] righteous and he that committeth sin is
[56:50] is of the is of the devil for the devil
[56:53] sinth from the beginning for this
[56:56] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[56:59] that he might destroy the works of the
[57:02] devil amen I just want to for a few
[57:05] moments uh you know I trust that this
[57:07] will directly connect with what our
[57:09] pastor spoke this morning in fact some
[57:12] of the uh quotes or thought that just
[57:14] came directly from what we not not some
[57:17] most of all just came from what we heard
[57:19] this morning uh I just want to speak uh
[57:23] give it a little title and say for this
[57:25] cause for this cause uh you know as
[57:29] Jesus said it we we read here in first
[57:32] John it said for this purpose the Son of
[57:35] God was manifested that he made that
[57:38] they might destroy the works of the
[57:40] devil so the the manifestation of the
[57:43] Son of God was for the purpose of
[57:45] destroying everything The Works of the
[57:47] enemy because these are two opposing
[57:50] kingdoms and and if he was the son of
[57:52] God and as as the Son of God we
[57:55] accomplish the same thing because we we
[57:58] become part of his kingdom so therefore
[58:00] our purpose is to destroy the works of
[58:02] the enemy our purpose is to manifest
[58:05] light is to become light is to do the
[58:08] things that Christ did is to have that
[58:11] same Spirit within us working the same
[58:13] way I I was thinking you know we we live
[58:16] in a time where knowledge even the
[58:19] scripture tells us that knowledge will
[58:21] increase you you look at technology you
[58:24] look at one man is able to to achieve
[58:26] today it's so high in wisdom and they so
[58:30] high in knowledge rather how that they
[58:32] can take things and and build things and
[58:35] and and use the previous year technology
[58:37] to build upon in order for them to
[58:39] achieve great things but you realize
[58:41] that as you go as we heard this morning
[58:45] that the Church of God was to be
[58:47] functioning by faith and not by
[58:49] knowledge right uh but yet we the the
[58:53] some of the greatest battle we face is
[58:55] is the the the the Battle of knowledge
[58:58] uh we we we no no doubt that often time
[59:01] people are challenged by what they know
[59:04] their understanding of the Bible and and
[59:07] and and and often time it it's amazing
[59:10] because um uh a man can say something
[59:14] and and another come and contradict him
[59:16] using the same Bible but as what what
[59:19] often times happen is one will go and
[59:22] use the writing of such and such and use
[59:24] the writing of such and such which all
[59:26] becomes men's knowledge which all
[59:29] becomes men uh you know one Scripture
[59:32] presented by men in such a way and the
[59:34] other uses the same scripture to present
[59:36] something different and so that's why it
[59:40] becomes so important that that that the
[59:42] that the things of God or the people of
[59:45] God were not made for them to be a
[59:48] knowledge transmitter to just sit around
[59:50] and and even as we heard this morning it
[59:53] just come and debate what the scripture
[59:55] says but but it was made that there
[59:57] becomes a life something that can walk
[1:00:00] something that can talk something that
[1:00:02] can express itself something that
[1:00:05] actually takes the scripture and makes
[1:00:07] it something to live and and so the and
[1:00:11] the purpose of the Gospel itself when we
[1:00:13] talk about the gospel or the good news
[1:00:16] it was not sent for debate or for for
[1:00:19] you to go out in the mission field and
[1:00:22] begin to transmit knowledge to people no
[1:00:25] it was send in in order to save the lost
[1:00:28] to heal the sick to manifest the power
[1:00:30] of God as our pastor quoted Paul this
[1:00:33] morning it says I didn't come with you
[1:00:35] to you with enticing knowledge where I
[1:00:38] can try to persuade you by way of
[1:00:41] knowledge by what I've studied and
[1:00:43] understand and show you something that
[1:00:45] you never seen before well another men
[1:00:48] will come and show you something
[1:00:49] different but when somebody comes when
[1:00:52] the gospel is preached or is brought
[1:00:54] with power and demonstr ation of the
[1:00:57] spirit nothing can take it away at that
[1:00:59] point because why it becomes a Living
[1:01:02] Word it become the reality of God
[1:01:05] Walking In the Flesh it becomes what it
[1:01:08] was what the scripture was spoken it
[1:01:10] becomes the very interpretation of what
[1:01:13] the scripture was and no one can take it
[1:01:16] away so we find out that that's what and
[1:01:19] often time in getting caught up in these
[1:01:22] things because that we we have to
[1:01:25] understand the the the enemy finds by
[1:01:27] all means a way for us not to obtain
[1:01:30] what God has in store for
[1:01:33] us it's he he comes by all means if if
[1:01:38] it's by sewing confusion if it's by
[1:01:41] getting you into the debate of knowledge
[1:01:44] or of understanding of scriptures or
[1:01:47] comparing scripture to scripture
[1:01:48] whatever he can do to cause the
[1:01:50] distraction for him to bring you in such
[1:01:53] a state where you felt the purpose of
[1:01:56] you fail to go for the mission that God
[1:01:58] has sent you that's what he's trying to
[1:02:00] achieve and I want to say this we we we
[1:02:02] will send the word of God was given to
[1:02:05] us for us to fulfill the same mission
[1:02:08] that Jesus did in fact brother says the
[1:02:11] church was sent on Earth in order to
[1:02:14] continue the works of Christ in order
[1:02:17] for us to save the lost in order for us
[1:02:19] to heal the sick in order for us to as
[1:02:22] the scripture says the signs and wonders
[1:02:24] will follow them that believe it was not
[1:02:27] sent for great debate or or for people
[1:02:30] to stand up and just say quote up
[1:02:32] scriptures and go right and the same
[1:02:34] people they do that they go right back
[1:02:36] into the sin that they came from no
[1:02:39] change at all not nothing that can prove
[1:02:42] well uh uh that God is walking with them
[1:02:44] they'll go and and as long as they
[1:02:47] satisfy uh their conscience as long as
[1:02:50] they they speak the word and satisfy
[1:02:52] their conscience as the scripture says
[1:02:54] they've taken the word of God and made
[1:02:56] it on non
[1:02:57] effect they've taken they they've taught
[1:03:01] uh uh uh uh they've taken the the
[1:03:04] thoughts of man and the understanding of
[1:03:06] man and made it the Commandment of
[1:03:09] God so we find out the the we we could
[1:03:12] look and he wants to cause destruction
[1:03:15] and and forget the very Mission and
[1:03:17] purpose for which we were coming we were
[1:03:20] sent here to do and and I began to think
[1:03:22] even about our own selves I could say
[1:03:25] tonight
[1:03:26] uh that I gather here that claim to
[1:03:28] believe the message of the hour often
[1:03:30] time the other the technique of the
[1:03:32] enemy will be uh uh to show you once you
[1:03:36] you've you've given the opportunity to
[1:03:38] see just how wonderful the beauty the
[1:03:41] Revelation and and how that God uh
[1:03:44] brings his word to pass and and the
[1:03:46] great things the great promises that God
[1:03:48] has made to us in this age the the the
[1:03:51] enemy will come and and he begin to work
[1:03:54] on you and and just to magnify your
[1:03:57] mistakes and and and show you how that
[1:03:59] you don't deserve it and and how that
[1:04:02] you are such a insignificant because I I
[1:04:05] no one has ever come in the presence of
[1:04:07] God and not realize that he's a sinner
[1:04:10] uh the presence of God just how Mighty
[1:04:12] he is and when he begins to open these
[1:04:14] things he it brings us to such a place
[1:04:17] he said this is so great it's it's far
[1:04:20] beyond what what what I can even
[1:04:22] understand so he tries to prer in the
[1:04:25] corner where all you look at is well you
[1:04:27] know I I'm such and I've done this and
[1:04:30] and it's amazing even how the devil
[1:04:32] plays with your mind it it's all it's
[1:04:35] always the latest mistake that's the
[1:04:37] greatest you know you you do something
[1:04:40] and and you you pray and you you try to
[1:04:42] get over it and and then if you make
[1:04:44] another mistakes he comes now he moves
[1:04:46] from the previous one and now it's the
[1:04:48] next one and and all those things and
[1:04:50] often time you keep looking down and
[1:04:53] down and all we come is God Sav we are
[1:04:56] saved today we are lost tomorrow we come
[1:04:59] to church we receive the word of God we
[1:05:01] feel strong by the time Sunday comes
[1:05:03] again we feel right back where we
[1:05:06] started the people of
[1:05:09] God he he wants to keep you in that
[1:05:12] condition and in that condition he knows
[1:05:15] he makes you powerless he knows in that
[1:05:18] condition you can never achieve anything
[1:05:20] because why you keep looking at the
[1:05:22] Flesh and you keep looking at this man
[1:05:24] and working hard to try to perfect him
[1:05:27] and I'm so thankful how the prophet
[1:05:29] brings these things in so many other
[1:05:31] words and so many different I I began to
[1:05:33] think about the prophet talking about
[1:05:35] the engine Chief and and how there was a
[1:05:37] white dog and the black dog and he said
[1:05:39] within you there are the two but what
[1:05:41] you need to be doing is to continually
[1:05:44] feed the white dog so he can be stronger
[1:05:48] and overcome the other
[1:05:51] one and that's what we are saying he
[1:05:53] said for this purpose I came I I didn't
[1:05:55] come to be defeated I didn't come to
[1:05:58] just look at my flesh and why because if
[1:06:01] you look at the flesh you will produce
[1:06:03] the things of the flesh but oh if you
[1:06:05] can look at the Spirit that's within you
[1:06:07] you can say for this purpose even as our
[1:06:09] Pastor said this morning the spirit of
[1:06:12] the Lord is upon me because he has
[1:06:14] anointed me somebody has to go preach
[1:06:17] this gospel somebody has to leave what
[1:06:20] the word is saying somebody has to
[1:06:22] produce this bride this message what the
[1:06:25] prophet has spoken and and somebody has
[1:06:28] to walk it and if there's one person
[1:06:31] it's
[1:06:32] me that's
[1:06:34] right it's not coming up with an
[1:06:36] attitude where you constantly looking
[1:06:39] down and you constantly looking at
[1:06:41] yourself you constantly and he knows in
[1:06:43] doing so you can never achieve anything
[1:06:46] that's and and and I'll say this but
[1:06:49] when I'm talks about this log this log
[1:06:52] that was in the
[1:06:53] water and and in the message I believe
[1:06:56] how can I overcome he talks about it how
[1:07:00] it it's in the water the very water that
[1:07:03] produces that that gives life it's in
[1:07:06] the water it drinks of the water it
[1:07:08] continue to drinks of the water but yet
[1:07:11] it's
[1:07:13] rotten you're like well I if I can just
[1:07:16] get water well the the the thing about
[1:07:18] it was the log is supposed to drink
[1:07:21] water and push out of what the life that
[1:07:24] he has inside of it it's not supposed to
[1:07:26] drink water and remain there there has
[1:07:29] to be a place where after it's drunk the
[1:07:32] water for it to try to push out the life
[1:07:34] that's within it so he can produce
[1:07:38] fruit so we can't be drinking of the
[1:07:41] word and and drinking of the word and
[1:07:43] drinking of the word and remaining it
[1:07:45] and just pointing back to ourselves and
[1:07:47] back to ourselves somebody's got to hear
[1:07:49] it and talk about
[1:07:51] it in fact what God does for us is not
[1:07:54] even for our own s it it does it for you
[1:07:57] so you can tell somebody so somebody can
[1:08:00] receive the same God the scripture says
[1:08:03] we have been given a Ministry of
[1:08:06] reconciliation what is the ministry of
[1:08:09] reconciliation taking man and taking God
[1:08:11] and bringing them together just like
[1:08:14] Christ
[1:08:16] did so we find out in doing so it
[1:08:20] paralyzes the very faith that we have
[1:08:24] which is the gift of God
[1:08:26] it brings you right back into the
[1:08:28] repentance right back into the circle of
[1:08:30] repentance and and I receive the Holy
[1:08:33] Spirit tomorrow I'm not sure if I really
[1:08:35] receive it and then the next day you
[1:08:37] come back to the altar he con con
[1:08:39] continually wants you to stay back in
[1:08:41] that Circle so we we realize it's the
[1:08:46] spirit the spirit of God it's not if
[1:08:50] it's the spirit of God if it's in you
[1:08:54] it's not said to do anything contrary to
[1:08:58] what the word of God is wanting to
[1:09:01] do and I can say this even as our Pastor
[1:09:05] said this Jesus said the spirit of God
[1:09:07] is upon
[1:09:08] me it sent me to bind the broken
[1:09:11] brokenhearted to to preach the year of
[1:09:14] of Jubilee and all those things the same
[1:09:16] spirit of God comes upon us to do the
[1:09:18] same thing but preach the message what
[1:09:21] was the Holy Spirit uh sent uh uh given
[1:09:24] for and and is talking that that it's
[1:09:27] very important we come to the
[1:09:28] realization that the same way that God
[1:09:30] sent Jesus is the same way that he's
[1:09:33] sending us it's not it's not different
[1:09:36] he said how did he send him the father
[1:09:38] who sent him went with him inside of him
[1:09:44] the father came and he became in the
[1:09:46] form of the spirit and he dwelt in the
[1:09:49] Son and the son said I cannot do nothing
[1:09:52] except what the father is talking to me
[1:09:56] and he said how is he going to send you
[1:09:58] he said he does the same exact way he
[1:10:01] comes in the form of the spirit after
[1:10:03] he's dead and he goes up and on the day
[1:10:06] of Pentecost he returns in the form of
[1:10:08] the spirit to send you exactly like the
[1:10:11] father send
[1:10:12] him so he in you can do the
[1:10:19] works but when him says in the message
[1:10:23] faith in action he says
[1:10:27] now Faith is not based
[1:10:31] upon shifting SS of of men's idea he
[1:10:36] said uh you couldn't if I came here and
[1:10:40] told you there was an angel of of the
[1:10:44] Lord uh that was in the building and
[1:10:47] these things happened and if I didn't
[1:10:49] have something to prove to to that to
[1:10:52] you you you would have the right to
[1:10:54] doubt it
[1:10:56] it says and if I said God gave me a gift
[1:10:59] to do a certain things and you seen it
[1:11:02] come right back around and fail and fail
[1:11:05] you would say that's
[1:11:07] wrong but when it comes right back and
[1:11:10] God proves it proves it every time to be
[1:11:14] perfect then that's right God has proved
[1:11:17] it so that's the way it has to be faith
[1:11:21] has to have a resting place and and I I
[1:11:24] just want you to think about what he's
[1:11:26] saying In This Moment now here's a man
[1:11:29] here's the word of God saying that God
[1:11:31] has called us to be Sons and Daughters
[1:11:34] here's the word of God even the
[1:11:35] messenger coming to the end time and
[1:11:37] saying that God has called us to be the
[1:11:39] very Bride of the end time so we have
[1:11:42] all those things that we say unless
[1:11:44] there has to be something by which we
[1:11:46] can prove that these things which we
[1:11:49] have read in the Bible are true unless
[1:11:51] there has to be a way by which some
[1:11:54] Works some
[1:11:56] identification something that can show
[1:11:58] that what the scripture says is true
[1:12:00] then why should anybody believe
[1:12:03] it why should anybody believe it because
[1:12:07] all it is is just men's knowledge men's
[1:12:10] understanding all it is is just our own
[1:12:12] claim but oh if you can just look back
[1:12:14] in your own life what the spirit has
[1:12:17] done with you how he taken you out of
[1:12:19] sin and cleanse you and and set you in a
[1:12:22] place and and he begin to speak to you
[1:12:24] through the word how is brought the
[1:12:26] change within your own life then if
[1:12:28] somebody told you you can say look at my
[1:12:30] life it's the very testimony that this
[1:12:33] message or this word is the truth it's
[1:12:35] the very testimony why because God has
[1:12:38] not just spoken it but has come back
[1:12:41] into my life and proven it to be
[1:12:46] true he says in in a message uh
[1:12:50] redemption in completeness it says and
[1:12:54] and here is what going on what's yes is
[1:12:57] what's what I'm trying to do he says if
[1:13:00] I want to know why if you want to know
[1:13:03] why I'm doing this here it says many of
[1:13:06] you say you never said you never seen me
[1:13:09] preach in healing campaign and and and
[1:13:12] it says but it's for a purpose I think
[1:13:15] and I think I could get souls broken
[1:13:18] down and come to the altar then I'll
[1:13:21] find if then I'll find the favor with
[1:13:23] God in Louisville that's right it says
[1:13:27] uh it says when there are when when
[1:13:30] people are ready to get down before God
[1:13:32] and pray and then and it says and then
[1:13:35] there are many of
[1:13:36] you friends that are praying and fasting
[1:13:40] and and afraid to take hold of what we
[1:13:43] are praying
[1:13:45] for it says that's right see it won't do
[1:13:49] you no good to fast and pray L you've
[1:13:53] got some Works to go go with
[1:13:57] it now I want you to get that it won't
[1:14:00] do you no good to fast and pray unless
[1:14:03] there are some Works to go with that and
[1:14:06] then he says all your faith in the world
[1:14:09] won't do a bit of good L you step right
[1:14:13] out and toeo toe with it and take it
[1:14:17] that's right you've got to go forward
[1:14:20] you've got to step right out and do it
[1:14:24] anyhow it's like a man I'm Desiring for
[1:14:27] God to give me a job I'm fasting and
[1:14:29] praying and I take a seat and I sit
[1:14:31] there and I don't do right
[1:14:33] nothing that's not the principle of God
[1:14:36] but Adam talks about the artisian well
[1:14:39] it says you can cry out all you want
[1:14:41] until you become skin and bones and you
[1:14:44] can shout out oh water I have a crop
[1:14:47] down here and I want you to come down
[1:14:49] here it won't do no good but oh if you
[1:14:52] can follow the principle of God after
[1:14:55] you you you you prayed and and you set
[1:14:58] your crop is set up in such a way that
[1:15:00] when you pray the water will come from
[1:15:02] up downwards into your crop you can't
[1:15:05] set your crop up and expect water to
[1:15:07] flow in a different direction why
[1:15:09] because it goes the against the very
[1:15:12] principle of God you can't look for a
[1:15:14] job and just sit on the chair and expect
[1:15:17] God to give you a chair a job from your
[1:15:19] couch you got to stand up and go out and
[1:15:22] do something it's the same way with the
[1:15:25] believer we can't claim that God is
[1:15:27] working within me and just sit at home
[1:15:29] and somebody's got to speak and
[1:15:31] somebody's got to test toy about his
[1:15:33] healing somebody's got to say
[1:15:38] something somebody's got to come through
[1:15:41] a place that said if God be real then I
[1:15:43] want to see him now somebody's got to
[1:15:46] say I'm taking him at his word and I'm
[1:15:48] acting and I'm moving forward and I'm
[1:15:51] speaking I can look foolish that's fine
[1:15:54] with me but but I'm doing what's in my
[1:15:56] heart to
[1:15:59] do and I'll say this show me a man who
[1:16:02] has no mistake I'll show you a man who
[1:16:06] has achieved
[1:16:09] nothing show me a man who has zero
[1:16:11] mistakes I'll show you a man who has
[1:16:14] nothing we we get paralyzed well if I do
[1:16:18] this then it's going to go wrong if I
[1:16:20] speak they won't believe me it's not
[1:16:22] even about you to begin with it's about
[1:16:24] about him it's about his word he has
[1:16:28] something he wants to achieve he's just
[1:16:30] looking for a body he's just looking for
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:36] anybody God is Not Looking for our
[1:16:38] knowledge or understanding of it all he
[1:16:41] just wants somebody to
[1:16:42] stand so he can come
[1:16:45] behind like the Messenger will stand
[1:16:48] there and and he begin to talk and
[1:16:50] you're like what is he talking about you
[1:16:52] know the other day in the meeting you
[1:16:55] know that such and such people and a
[1:16:57] person standing right there and you're
[1:16:59] like Oh my he said but you know I'm
[1:17:02] waiting for
[1:17:04] something you know I'm waiting for
[1:17:07] something what is that that's a man
[1:17:10] who's got faith because he knew the
[1:17:12] angel told him to go and stand there and
[1:17:15] he will stand there however he takes
[1:17:17] until that angel comes down and prove
[1:17:20] that were to be true oh and I tell you
[1:17:22] that angel shut up why because it was a
[1:17:25] promise that he made to him oh if we can
[1:17:29] just know that we have an angel who's
[1:17:31] there behind to make the work to come to
[1:17:36] pass it says when you ask for anything
[1:17:40] to get it God said it's yours don't take
[1:17:43] nothing less get what what you asked for
[1:17:46] you do you do that and find out how it
[1:17:49] comes out yeah don't go back and say
[1:17:52] well I'll take the I'll take sex seconds
[1:17:56] no don't go out and say well you know I
[1:17:58] asked and it looks like God is not going
[1:18:00] to give it to me let him speak to your
[1:18:04] heart in the everpresent water he says
[1:18:07] when you when you are saved God gives
[1:18:10] you Faith to rise from the mark and from
[1:18:14] the
[1:18:15] earth your faith overcome the things of
[1:18:18] the world what is your faith it says
[1:18:21] your faith is the act that God has did
[1:18:25] is did it in you to make you a Son of
[1:18:29] God you quit lying you quit stealing you
[1:18:33] quit drinking because your faith Rises
[1:18:36] up above
[1:18:38] it I I I just want you to understand
[1:18:41] just even see the language that is
[1:18:43] putting it something within your heart
[1:18:45] just Rises up and say this is it I'm
[1:18:49] done with it something within your heart
[1:18:51] and Faith you hear the word of God and
[1:18:54] something Rises up and just say I'm not
[1:18:57] going to do this anymore and God is
[1:18:59] there remember God is there to confirm
[1:19:01] to you that I've done it you know we
[1:19:06] when we are here our faith even the the
[1:19:09] the the you know speaks about being
[1:19:11] saved he says it's our confession when
[1:19:14] we come and we confess we are saved God
[1:19:16] will come after our confession to
[1:19:18] confirm it and when he does the
[1:19:20] confirmation you know some of us have
[1:19:22] been saved for 20 30 years and all those
[1:19:24] those things why why are you still saved
[1:19:27] because you're continuing to confess it
[1:19:30] and God is coming right behind it
[1:19:32] vindicating vindicating it every
[1:19:37] time how is he vindicating it he's
[1:19:40] taking away the desires of the world the
[1:19:42] things that we used to struggle with he
[1:19:44] he come and put it out and and he does
[1:19:47] he takes it out he walks with you he
[1:19:49] shows you continually that you believe
[1:19:52] my word and I'm here to confirm it to be
[1:19:58] true he
[1:20:01] says you quit lying you quit stealing
[1:20:04] you quit drinking because your faith
[1:20:06] Rises up above it amen you don't do it
[1:20:10] you don't have any faith any it says and
[1:20:13] by faith you saved and that through
[1:20:17] Grace as much as your faith will release
[1:20:19] it will will be released that's how much
[1:20:22] power we can have
[1:20:26] as much
[1:20:28] Faith as much as your faith will be
[1:20:31] released that's as much power we can
[1:20:34] have because in your dwelling in in you
[1:20:38] dwells the power that makes the Heaven
[1:20:41] and the Earth God dwells in you and you
[1:20:45] are a son and a daughter of God Amen
[1:20:47] there you are but that's your faith
[1:20:50] Jesus said according according to your
[1:20:53] faith be unto you if thou can't believe
[1:20:57] all things are possible I say unto you
[1:21:00] if you say unto this mountain be th
[1:21:02] remove and be and and and don't doubt
[1:21:06] but believe with all believe what you
[1:21:12] said in a message the everpresent uh in
[1:21:15] in everpresent water from the rock it
[1:21:17] says then what kind of Faith what kind
[1:21:20] of what kind of people we ought to be we
[1:21:23] ought we ought to be having faith in
[1:21:26] this great redeeming Christ that lives
[1:21:29] in US it says this Mitten rock that
[1:21:32] never leaves that never leaves the
[1:21:35] church it says I'm with you always even
[1:21:39] in you even even to the end of the world
[1:21:42] that everpresent great gushing of
[1:21:45] Salvation and power that pour out from
[1:21:48] the cross unto the church that ever
[1:21:51] present present of of the Living God
[1:21:55] great flowing smart smitten rock that
[1:21:58] goes with us all our journey Hallelujah
[1:22:01] it it's not us just walking and and here
[1:22:04] he is and saying we that's that's what
[1:22:06] the church is and and often time what we
[1:22:09] we forget the very purpose for which the
[1:22:11] church was sent yes sir we forget the
[1:22:14] the the very purpose for which we were
[1:22:16] created we were not made to make to make
[1:22:19] ourselves perfect we were not made to
[1:22:22] continually take the word and look and
[1:22:24] just just you know pour it out on me you
[1:22:26] know today they preach about Sinners you
[1:22:28] feel like a sinner tomorrow they preach
[1:22:30] about sinner you feel about Sinner and
[1:22:32] never coming to the place where you
[1:22:33] realize I am a son and I'm going to take
[1:22:36] whatever my position is and walk with it
[1:22:39] God is looking this is the adoption time
[1:22:42] the prophet tells us and the adoption is
[1:22:44] not a different spirit it's the same
[1:22:47] spirit that births you it's the same
[1:22:49] spirit that takes you and he walks with
[1:22:51] you and tutor use until you get to a
[1:22:54] place where you know that I have been
[1:22:56] sent here for a
[1:22:58] purpose for this purpose I came into the
[1:23:01] world I came for a purpose why that I
[1:23:05] might reflect the kingdom of my father
[1:23:07] that I might do the works of God Like
[1:23:10] Jesus said even like John written and
[1:23:12] said wrote and said it's it's for this
[1:23:15] purpose that he might destroy the works
[1:23:17] of the enemy how are we going to destroy
[1:23:20] it If all we're looking at is our own
[1:23:23] selves
[1:23:27] you know I like that story about that
[1:23:30] King I'm not sure even if I'm quoting it
[1:23:33] right who who came and he wanted
[1:23:37] somebody to ride with him I believe
[1:23:39] brother Andrew mentioned it a while back
[1:23:42] he began to look and yes this bunch of
[1:23:45] generals and soldiers and you know clean
[1:23:48] clothes and nice haircut and you know
[1:23:51] Stars just shining he looked at it and
[1:23:54] he just passed pass pass oh but he saw
[1:23:58] this man seemed to have been wounded in
[1:24:01] the war just seemed to have been limping
[1:24:04] a little bit and just them his uniform
[1:24:06] was not just as clean as the others and
[1:24:09] he looked at him and he stopped and he
[1:24:12] called him off and said he just came
[1:24:14] from the front line he said that's the
[1:24:16] guy he wanted to ride with him Jesus
[1:24:19] didn't didn't have it easy he gave his
[1:24:22] life
[1:24:24] he gave everything that he was so he can
[1:24:27] purchase you we heard it this morning he
[1:24:30] Li for the sin of the whole world he
[1:24:33] didn't leave anything out he didn't give
[1:24:35] a devil a chance he didn't leave him
[1:24:38] anything he died for everything so that
[1:24:41] we can come and possess it and walk in
[1:24:44] it the purpose of Christ was to die so
[1:24:47] he can annihilate sin but the he was the
[1:24:49] first M among among many Brethren but he
[1:24:52] knew when his Brethren will come they
[1:24:54] will go in and possess the very land
[1:24:56] that he died
[1:24:59] for they will continue the battle they
[1:25:02] will continue in the fight they're not
[1:25:05] going to walk back and say well you know
[1:25:08] you know he did it all we don't have
[1:25:09] anything to do no he wanted us to be
[1:25:12] courageous to stand firm to take our
[1:25:15] position and say for this cause if
[1:25:18] there's one single cause if I can sum up
[1:25:21] my own life if I could sum up everything
[1:25:24] I am is for this cause I came into the
[1:25:30] world but what I'm talks about I I want
[1:25:33] you to hear this he talks about the
[1:25:35] blind man who was healed and he says in
[1:25:37] the message perseverance he said the
[1:25:39] blind man he says the blind man that I
[1:25:42] spoke with a while ago he couldn't argue
[1:25:44] with he says he couldn't argue with
[1:25:46] theology with them he know nothing about
[1:25:49] it they could say why so and so and so
[1:25:52] and so he said I don't know about you
[1:25:55] theology here is he came before the one
[1:25:58] that was supposed to be the Masters in
[1:26:00] Israel they began to question him about
[1:26:03] theology well you know we are of Moses
[1:26:06] Moses said in his book and and he said
[1:26:08] this and this he said I don't know what
[1:26:10] you guys are talking about I can't
[1:26:13] answer to that I don't know anything
[1:26:15] about that but one thing I know is I was
[1:26:18] blind but now I see what is it it was
[1:26:21] somebody something happened to him that
[1:26:24] there's no way you could shut him off
[1:26:26] why he came in contact with God and
[1:26:29] there's no way you can shut him off and
[1:26:32] he came and he said after they've talked
[1:26:34] about the theology they knew that well
[1:26:37] you know he can't answer so what do we
[1:26:38] do with this he said but I have a
[1:26:40] question for you you call yourself
[1:26:43] masters and you've educated yourself and
[1:26:45] all the things and said how is it that I
[1:26:47] was blind and know I see and this man
[1:26:50] who heal him you know nothing about
[1:26:53] him but what them said then they had a
[1:26:56] real question then they had the real
[1:27:00] question we get tripped by theology you
[1:27:03] know you know this word here and you
[1:27:06] know some now it's no longer the King
[1:27:08] James we got to go find something else
[1:27:11] what are we
[1:27:13] doing oh but if it becomes a life if
[1:27:17] it's something that I know in my prayer
[1:27:19] closet in my place where I know I know
[1:27:22] what was in my heart and I know what
[1:27:24] it's been changed to there's nobody who
[1:27:27] can argue against
[1:27:29] that don't be tripped by theology seek
[1:27:32] him they told you don't know your Bible
[1:27:35] he looked they said that that he says
[1:27:37] that that's okay but I know the author
[1:27:39] real well why have met him let's know
[1:27:43] the altor let him walk on us and let him
[1:27:46] do the works that he said he was going
[1:27:48] to do on us and let's go out there
[1:27:50] testify of his great things
[1:27:54] God is not asked us to testify of
[1:27:57] something that he didn't do for
[1:28:00] us he's asking us to only testify of
[1:28:04] what we have known about
[1:28:07] him the scripture says we speak that we
[1:28:10] do know we testify of what we have
[1:28:14] seen and he says the reason why you
[1:28:16] don't believe is because you have not
[1:28:18] received a witness it's because you have
[1:28:21] not received a witness but if you
[1:28:23] receive a witness when his testimonies
[1:28:25] Goes Forth you receive
[1:28:28] it there's a witness to the testimony
[1:28:32] there's one that will stand and say I
[1:28:34] know that God I desire that God it's not
[1:28:38] you doing something it's him calling his
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:42] children and yet we are we are afraid
[1:28:46] you know we we just cow down and and the
[1:28:49] devil turn it right back on us and he
[1:28:51] looks at us and he'll go oh no I'm not
[1:29:02] he
[1:29:03] says just find a place to close here we
[1:29:05] have to communion he speaks about on the
[1:29:08] day of Pentecost it says those poor
[1:29:11] people at Pentecost a bunch of fishermen
[1:29:15] tax collectors and so forth with humble
[1:29:19] jobs they went up there on the promise
[1:29:22] of God and they waited up in their Upper
[1:29:25] Room 10 days and all of the sudden there
[1:29:28] came a sound from heaven like a rushing
[1:29:31] Mighty Wind filled filled all the house
[1:29:35] where they were they were sitting and
[1:29:38] then it says they went up into
[1:29:40] action because that they had seen a
[1:29:45] promise of God made
[1:29:47] manifest the propose of Promise is
[1:29:51] propelling us into action is is bringing
[1:29:54] God doesn't save you so you can go and
[1:29:57] brag around how you are
[1:30:01] saved in fact you know didn't brother
[1:30:04] tells us that God doesn't heal you just
[1:30:06] to heal you to show that he can heal he
[1:30:09] wants something
[1:30:10] back you want to why am I healing you
[1:30:14] why am I saving
[1:30:17] you you you you don't you have to tell
[1:30:19] him why you want him to save you don't
[1:30:22] you have to tell him why you want him to
[1:30:23] heal you it's like that that that
[1:30:25] Parable the scripture says in the in the
[1:30:28] the the the Bible how that he gave
[1:30:30] talents the man who gave the talent the
[1:30:32] master came back and then he says to him
[1:30:34] that he gave two he produce another two
[1:30:36] the three he produces another one but
[1:30:38] the one who was given a singular said he
[1:30:40] came back and says I was scared remember
[1:30:44] I was afraid and I went and hid
[1:30:47] it now I want you to how beautiful the
[1:30:51] words that he comes out of his own mouth
[1:30:53] and he says I know you
[1:30:55] require that you which you have not
[1:30:57] given in other words when he was given a
[1:30:59] talent he knew that an increase will be
[1:31:02] asked of what was given to
[1:31:07] him we're not just given what we are
[1:31:10] given for us to rejoice and and just
[1:31:12] become just ourselves no we are given in
[1:31:15] order for us to tear up the
[1:31:18] world just like the first one butam says
[1:31:21] they were together it says then they
[1:31:23] came in they were a persecutor that were
[1:31:25] scattered out into the world and he says
[1:31:27] the reason why he scattered them out so
[1:31:29] they can go and
[1:31:38] testify I just want us to know to come
[1:31:41] back to the very Mission and the purpose
[1:31:45] what is the mission of the church what
[1:31:48] is the purpose of the church but says
[1:31:51] the church have long forgotten what they
[1:31:53] were given
[1:31:54] there so many he says in fact they've
[1:31:57] come to a place where they've they've
[1:31:59] replaced the very mission that they were
[1:32:02] given with programs with a bunch of
[1:32:04] programs for this and program for that
[1:32:07] and the power of God is nowhere to be
[1:32:08] they were given the power and and and
[1:32:11] the devil came and take that power right
[1:32:13] out of the
[1:32:14] church and and you know you sick they
[1:32:16] refer you to a doctor you know you you
[1:32:20] you you mentally heal you know let's
[1:32:21] find a psychiatrist
[1:32:25] that's what they all become but there
[1:32:27] were people that were promised in this
[1:32:29] same time as our Pastor said the
[1:32:32] restoration of the real Faith they are
[1:32:35] not satisfied with just theology or some
[1:32:37] men's understanding if Jesus Is God if
[1:32:41] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:43] forever then there has to be a people
[1:32:45] who says I want to see
[1:32:49] him I'm not interested in theology I
[1:32:51] want to see that God for myself I want
[1:32:54] to meet him I want to touch him I want
[1:32:56] to feel him I want to see his power
[1:33:00] manifested isn't one of the things that
[1:33:02] they couldn't stop about but they would
[1:33:05] talk all about his theology but when
[1:33:07] that men stood there oh the power the
[1:33:10] presence of God all of them denomination
[1:33:13] name they talk about the presence that
[1:33:15] was with
[1:33:16] him what is it it was God making himself
[1:33:20] known in fact they testify on how
[1:33:22] they've seen God in this generation once
[1:33:25] again like they never seen him before
[1:33:27] amen God bless
[1:33:29] you
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:41] amen that's the gospel
[1:33:44] Hallelujah that's the gospel he didn't
[1:33:47] send the Holy Spirit to save you he send
[1:33:51] the Holy Spirit to empower you to do the
[1:33:55] work that he did amen I
[1:33:59] that's I mean he just expressed what's
[1:34:02] on my heart and and let me just say
[1:34:08] this because it's something that has to
[1:34:11] get washed out of us and it's in US
[1:34:14] thick is the nickol ladian
[1:34:20] spirit and the nickan spirits
[1:34:24] says it's for somebody else to
[1:34:29] do that's the base root of the spirit
[1:34:34] that God
[1:34:35] hates is to
[1:34:37] conquer the
[1:34:40] Le and the Le
[1:34:44] surrendered their
[1:34:47] calling because they're
[1:34:49] lazy and
[1:34:51] Afraid and they let the Ministry speak
[1:34:55] for them they let the ministry teach
[1:35:00] them you know brother Billy said
[1:35:03] something to me that really stirred
[1:35:06] me today he said so many young people
[1:35:10] and so many people that have come from
[1:35:13] different cultures and different things
[1:35:15] they've sat under Ministries that just
[1:35:17] tell them everything to
[1:35:20] do you understand we got a god amen
[1:35:24] we've got the Holy Spirit God sent his
[1:35:27] Spirit to lead the
[1:35:31] church the fivefold ministry is not to
[1:35:34] Lord over God's Heritage but they're
[1:35:37] there there to serve maybe through
[1:35:39] experience or wisdom or things like that
[1:35:43] but it just just what Billy said it just
[1:35:46] something that it's a
[1:35:48] work but and our work is to show the
[1:35:51] world Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:35:54] today and forever to show them the god
[1:35:58] that you haven't me and if you haven't
[1:36:00] meant that God then it's our job as a
[1:36:04] body of Believers not me as a preacher
[1:36:07] but as a body of Believers to manifest
[1:36:10] and show that that God is here for you
[1:36:13] to
[1:36:16] touch and that's what we want then
[1:36:18] that's what we want to commune with
[1:36:20] tonight I mean the we're here that's
[1:36:23] here and we'll go forward with what
[1:36:26] we've got here but there's so many
[1:36:29] people sitting at home and if you're
[1:36:31] sitting at home and not coming at
[1:36:33] Communion because you're still afraid of
[1:36:36] this
[1:36:38] bug I think you're afraid to die and
[1:36:42] meet
[1:36:46] God that might be a little
[1:36:50] strong but Church used to be where we
[1:36:52] came to get
[1:36:54] well now it's we we don't come to church
[1:36:57] to get well we think if we come to
[1:36:59] church we'll get
[1:37:01] sick you you talk about Satan robbing us
[1:37:07] I love that Billy robbing us from what
[1:37:09] our purpose is I I could just repr
[1:37:12] preach that I tried to preach it this
[1:37:14] morning but now I can repr preach
[1:37:18] it it it's really a time I I I'm
[1:37:22] inspired by that each that's what I want
[1:37:25] to have communion with tonight I want to
[1:37:27] come have communion with the god that
[1:37:30] showed himself to me the god that's real
[1:37:33] and my communion is Lord I want to show
[1:37:35] you to the
[1:37:36] world and remember is it's not he didn't
[1:37:40] say David McGary go and pray for the
[1:37:43] sick he said you go into all the world
[1:37:48] you preach the posel these signs shall
[1:37:50] follow you if you believe in in him like
[1:37:55] brother Billy said he's there to believe
[1:37:58] in
[1:38:01] you and just think of that whenever two
[1:38:06] agree on any one thing it'll come to
[1:38:09] pass so you and him is
[1:38:14] two wherever two or three
[1:38:17] Gather in my name I'll be in their midst
[1:38:22] so he's got to be here
[1:38:24] and is that your heart's desire to come
[1:38:26] closer to that God young people don't be
[1:38:29] distracted by this
[1:38:32] world set set forth in your heart don't
[1:38:35] be
[1:38:37] all taken up with every new thing that
[1:38:40] comes along you know every new boy in
[1:38:43] town every new girl in town you know
[1:38:47] what I mean you might look and seek what
[1:38:49] their motives and objectives are you
[1:38:53] know and the things that that that take
[1:38:56] place our motive and objective should be
[1:38:58] the
[1:39:00] Lord no I've pastored a long time I've
[1:39:02] had people show up to church I kind of
[1:39:05] wonder what it's here and it's not two
[1:39:07] or three weeks later they got a big
[1:39:09] sales for me they got a business
[1:39:12] they want me to get involved in they
[1:39:14] they they want to have a
[1:39:16] loan and you sit back what's our motive
[1:39:19] and
[1:39:20] objective our motive and objective is
[1:39:22] him
[1:39:24] we're here for him that's right and and
[1:39:26] and I I just think that's marvelous
[1:39:29] let's go ahead Brothers if you go ahead
[1:39:31] and get ready for communion and and
[1:39:35] uh and uh we we certainly uh love the
[1:39:40] word of God and we'll turn in our
[1:39:43] scriptures and
[1:39:45] uh read in our scriptures this evening
[1:39:49] and and uh uh the great things that we
[1:39:53] have so let us turn in our Bibles and
[1:39:57] turn to the um
[1:40:00] um let me
[1:40:04] to uh in this this this use the
[1:40:08] Corinthian scriptures for communion amen
[1:40:14] so let's stand together this evening
[1:40:17] turn to the uh 11th chapter
[1:40:44] you know if you ever we always read the
[1:40:47] communion part but if you ever go back
[1:40:49] and read the rest of that 11th chapter
[1:40:53] it's quite a rebuke to a church that's
[1:40:55] lost its motive and objective for I have
[1:40:59] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:41:01] deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the
[1:41:05] same night in which he was betrayed took
[1:41:09] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:41:12] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:41:15] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:41:21] remembrance of me
[1:41:23] see the purpose behind it the communion
[1:41:26] behind it the fellowship behind it and
[1:41:30] after the same manner also he took the
[1:41:33] cup when he had slept saying this cup is
[1:41:36] the New Testament my blood this do is
[1:41:40] offing as you drink it you drink it in
[1:41:44] remembrance of me amen let us pray
