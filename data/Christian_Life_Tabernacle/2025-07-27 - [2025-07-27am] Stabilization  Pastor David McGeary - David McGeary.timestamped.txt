[29:06] and make it possible.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the kind of God we
[29:10] serve. Amen. We have some testimonies
[29:12] here. Um
[29:16] uh just an announcement. Brother, uh
[29:18] Jean Timomo writes, "Dear saints, by the
[29:21] grace of God, we came back safely from
[29:23] Cameroon and thank you so much for your
[29:25] prayers." Amen. We thank God for
[29:27] traveling mercies. Amen.
[29:32] Amen. Brother Enoch writes, uh, I'd
[29:35] like, uh, he says, I'd like the saints
[29:38] of the living God to join me in thanking
[29:40] God for granting me a teaching job here
[29:43] in the community college here in Texas.
[29:46] Amen. His wonderful name be praised
[29:48] always. Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:52] Amen. What do you have need of this
[29:54] morning? Amen. You can certainly lift up
[29:56] your hands in faith and know that is God
[29:58] this morning that he will meet the needs
[30:01] of the believers. whatever it is. Amen.
[30:04] He's here to do it according to his
[30:06] word. Amen. The brothers that are taking
[30:08] the offerings, if you could come,
[30:09] Brother Tim Sal, if you could just come
[30:11] and take the stage before the church.
[30:14] Amen.
[30:17] [Music]
[30:22] What a blessing it is to be gathered
[30:24] together. You know this uh this Bible I
[30:27] hold here.
[30:30] Brother Brandham explained it much
[30:32] better than I can. There's two wings
[30:34] like an eagle. There's an Old Testament
[30:36] and a New Testament.
[30:39] And I don't understand completely how a
[30:42] man can come in the flesh, humble
[30:45] himself, the creator of heaven and
[30:47] earth,
[30:49] come down in a kangaroo court and be
[30:52] completely guiltless. Pilate tried to
[30:55] wash his hand and say, "I find no fault
[30:57] in him." Yet he died.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; But his own word says, "Where a
[31:01] testament is, there must also a
[31:03] necessity be a death of the testator."
[31:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz a testament is a force after men are
[31:09] dead. Otherwise, it's no strength at all
[31:11] while a man liveth. We also have a
[31:13] testament. Let me tell you,
[31:17] out of necessity, this man must die.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; All right? So whatever we have need of,
[31:24] we can say, "Lord, I lay myself at your
[31:25] altar this morning. Cleanse me, purify
[31:29] me that I may live out your testament in
[31:32] my life." Let's bow our heads. Gracious
[31:35] and kind heavenly father, we approach
[31:37] you once again, Lord, in true humility
[31:40] of spirit, Lord, and knowing that our
[31:42] lives are are worthless without you,
[31:46] Lord. You've cleaned us up. You've set
[31:48] aside us for your service. You
[31:50] sanctified us, Lord. You filled us with
[31:52] your spirit and now we come as your word
[31:55] says we can come boldly to the throne of
[31:57] grace. Lord we do this by faith
[32:00] believing
[32:02] in the blood of of one Lord not bulls
[32:05] and goats that we have to continually
[32:08] come but once forever Lord you've
[32:10] entered into that holy place and now we
[32:13] call upon your name Lord at the mercy
[32:15] seat the right hand of the father. Lord
[32:18] you you know it all. You see it all. you
[32:21] know, our our heartfelt cries to you,
[32:23] Lord, when we don't even know how to
[32:25] voice it, Lord. The uncction and crying
[32:28] out, the groaning of our spirits, Lord.
[32:30] We pray that you just be a high priest
[32:32] and intervene on our behalf today, Lord.
[32:35] Lord, the things that are upon our
[32:37] hearts, those things that are spoken and
[32:39] unspoken, uplifted hands, each one,
[32:42] Lord, we just commit it all to you for
[32:43] your honor and glory. Lord, as the word
[32:46] comes forth, may we claim it, believe
[32:48] it, accept it, apply it to our lives,
[32:50] Lord, and see the bountiful fruits of it
[32:52] as we go onward in this life. Lord, just
[32:56] use the tithes and offerings for your
[32:58] honor and glory as well. Just be with
[33:00] those that are out. We think of our
[33:01] pastor, Sister Lesly. Lord, just bless
[33:04] them and keep them, Lord. All those that
[33:06] may be traveling, but Lord, we thank you
[33:08] for those that have assembled here
[33:10] together. May we be a blessing to one
[33:13] another and may we be blessed by having
[33:14] been in your presence today. We ask this
[33:16] in the name of the lovely Lord Jesus
[33:19] Christ. Amen.

[42:33] Hallelujah.
[42:35] Lord, we've come to worship you this
[42:37] morning.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, we've come to hear your word.
[42:43] Father, we've come to acknowledge you in
[42:47] all your ways, Father. And to exalt and
[42:52] lift you high above,
[42:54] Father, we confess with our hearts that
[42:58] you are Lord of Lord and King of Kings.
[43:01] Father that all things were made by you
[43:04] and for you and without you nothing
[43:07] consists. Father you are certainly the
[43:11] all and all. We ask you to receive our
[43:15] hearts this morning. Father forgive us
[43:17] of our trespasses.
[43:19] Father our weaknesses the battles we go
[43:22] through. Lord oh God be merciful and
[43:26] mighty on our behalf. We ask it in Jesus
[43:31] precious name we pray. Amen.
[43:35] Amen. I I was sitting in my office and
[43:40] and brother Tim came to pray and and uh
[43:44] I had this uh quote right on my desk. I
[43:49] was reading and it says so perfect. The
[43:53] word of God is so perfect. Even the Old
[43:56] and New Testament is two halves of one
[44:00] whole. That's right. Old testament is
[44:04] half of it. The New Testament is half of
[44:07] it. Put it together and you got the
[44:09] whole revelation of Jesus Christ. There
[44:13] is the prophet speaking and here he is
[44:15] in person. See two halves and one whole.
[44:19] Now we don't want to take too much. He
[44:22] says, "Now remember the Old Testament is
[44:25] not complete without the new and the new
[44:28] could not be complete without the old.
[44:31] That's the reason I say two halves and
[44:34] one whole." So I just thought that had
[44:35] he come up and he said that it it was
[44:38] right there and right next to that
[44:42] before we read our scripture
[44:44] uh I thought this was something you know
[44:48] uh different people have different ideas
[44:51] of the rapture and that's what we're
[44:53] living for right we're living for the
[44:56] rapture. So the the messenger said this.
[44:59] He said, "You see these little pockets
[45:01] going through the air?
[45:04] They call saucers and so forth. People,
[45:08] well, well, we better leave that alone."
[45:12] Here, all these people come up missing.
[45:15] You say, "Don't hear from them. They're
[45:19] standing there and they're not there."
[45:22] That's the way the rapture is going to
[45:24] be. One of them will drop right down and
[45:29] this terrestrial body will take on a
[45:32] celestial body and and hide heron or
[45:37] born left. It'll be transformed in the
[45:40] moment of time. Dropping right out of
[45:43] space and taking home that. See?
[45:48] See all this is going on now. And the
[45:52] pentagons wondering about these lights
[45:55] and mysterious lights and everything
[45:58] that they're seeing in the sky. You seen
[46:01] that they had one here in the paper in
[46:04] Jeffersonville this week and so forth, a
[46:06] mystic light. So, oh, they don't know
[46:09] what it is, but listen, little children,
[46:11] it's going to pick you up one of these
[46:15] days. See, don't worry.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I thought, you know, I
[46:21] that kind of gave a new definition to
[46:24] the uh meaning of I'll fly away. You
[46:28] know what I mean? He said, "One of them
[46:31] saucers one day is just going to drop
[46:33] down and pick you up."
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's looking for the pickup?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Every You know, I hope it's
[46:41] true. They say there's more pickups in
[46:43] Texas than any other state. Well, I hope
[46:45] there's more. I hope there's more. Amen.
[46:49] Hallelujah. You might as well say it the
[46:51] way you like it, right?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord richly bless you. Before we
[46:55] read our scriptures, I'd like to make a
[46:57] couple announcement. There's
[46:59] construction going on in the back of the
[47:01] church.
[47:03] We're making a little pavilion to put
[47:04] the Gaga and Spike ball and the little
[47:07] games for the kids back there and also
[47:09] use it for other venues. And so there's
[47:13] open ditches, there's a lot of dirt. So,
[47:16] uh, mothers, if you don't mind your kids
[47:19] falling in a ditch and and, uh, uh,
[47:24] playing in the mud, then don't watch
[47:26] them.
[47:28] Okay? But if you don't want them to
[47:30] break a leg or get poked or get full of
[47:33] mud, then watch them. Daddy's help.
[47:36] Watch the kids. Everybody watch one
[47:38] another. So, let's be careful about the
[47:41] back. Okay. We have construction and
[47:44] then uh service tonight. See me. I I'm
[47:48] going to take this evening service. I
[47:50] leave Tuesday for three weeks to go to
[47:54] Africa. So, we want you to have us keep
[47:56] in prayer. we leave Tuesday, but this
[47:58] evening after service uh the Steppen
[48:02] family is um uh they're moving to
[48:05] Prescott, Arizona. They're opening a
[48:08] nursing home uh with their daughter and
[48:12] their son-in-law. And so tonight, we're
[48:15] going to have a little farewell, not
[48:17] goodbye, because we Christians don't say
[48:20] goodbye. So, we're just going to say
[48:22] farewell as they start on this journey
[48:26] of life. and they have a heart for the
[48:29] old people and and uh uh so you know I
[48:33] hope if I get to that place that I could
[48:35] have a Christian like that looking after
[48:38] me and I'm I'm pretty good shape because
[48:40] I got a lot of nurses in here. Uh so uh
[48:45] I I might take two or three to take care
[48:47] of me. But we're we're grateful for them
[48:50] and the service that they had here. and
[48:52] and you never know our our uh you know I
[48:55] tried to get my brother to preach as
[48:57] much as I could and and I wasn't too
[49:00] successful on that. So maybe God can use
[49:03] him to speak to the uh those those
[49:06] people there in Prescott. So we're going
[49:08] to have some ice cream and if anybody
[49:11] else wants to bring another dessert, you
[49:13] can. And we'll have coffee and ice cream
[49:15] after a short service this evening. So,
[49:19] we need a few brothers to help set up
[49:21] tables. And so, we'll say our our tell
[49:25] uh uh aa vista. We'll say see you later,
[49:29] but till next time, right? And then if
[49:33] they don't like the nursing home
[49:35] business, they can always come home and
[49:38] nurse me. So,
[49:41] we appreciate that. So, remember the
[49:43] construction and remember the service
[49:47] this evening. So, let's turn in our
[49:49] Bibles over to Hebrews
[49:52] and we're going to play a little about
[49:54] 14 minutes this morning because there's
[49:57] something I really like you to hear. And
[50:00] uh and we're going to read the first few
[50:03] verses of the book of Hebrews, the first
[50:06] chapter and the first uh couple verses
[50:11] uh of um Hebrews.
[50:16] And so Hebrews 1:1,
[50:19] God who at sundried times and in diverse
[50:23] manners spake in times past unto the
[50:26] fathers by the prophets.
[50:30] So the prophets prophesied,
[50:33] right? And now we just heard our prophet
[50:35] say, "What they prophesied now
[50:39] had come to pass."
[50:42] So now what was spoken of had appeared.
[50:47] So now what appeared is what's speaking.
[50:51] So he says hath in these last days
[50:54] spoken to us by his son. Who hath
[50:59] appointed heir of all things by whom
[51:02] also he made the worlds.
[51:06] who being in the brightness of his glory
[51:09] and the express image of his person and
[51:13] upholding all things by the word of his
[51:17] power. When he hath by himself purged
[51:21] our sins, sat down on the right hand of
[51:25] the majesty
[51:27] on high. Amen. In the beginning was the
[51:31] word and the word was with God and the
[51:34] word was God. You may be seated this
[51:38] morning.
[51:44] Before we uh just speak just uh uh play
[51:48] that little portion of uh the message
[51:51] we'd like to play for you. Um
[51:55] we we we see in that scripture a a a
[51:59] beautiful
[52:00] uh
[52:02] uh revelation is the best way that I can
[52:06] express it of how God's word works.
[52:12] And you know we are the generation
[52:16] that is watching what was prophesied
[52:19] fulfilled.
[52:21] Brother Brennan was in the day of the
[52:24] prophecy for he was a prophet. Uh he was
[52:28] a seer. So he would speak as if it
[52:34] existed at the very moment because in
[52:38] his realm it did.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; It it was a reality. That was something
[52:45] that a prophet had the great ability to
[52:49] do was was to uh could be there if I
[52:54] could. I don't know another way to
[52:56] express it. But he would see it even to
[52:59] the place where he would have a vision
[53:02] and he would know there would have to be
[53:04] a had. And the prophet of God said in
[53:07] order to do that it had to exist
[53:11] someplace in time.
[53:13] And so the the prophet was able to uh
[53:18] travel because it it was real. It was
[53:22] prophesied. It was spoken and he was
[53:25] able to travel to there and to see it
[53:28] what was to be. Now we're limited to
[53:31] that because God didn't give us that
[53:34] gift to do that. And also he could go
[53:37] back and see what was. And so with that
[53:42] ability to go back and see what was and
[53:45] to see just like Jesus with the woman at
[53:47] the well, he could go back and to see
[53:50] what her problem was. She he knew what
[53:52] her problem was. He knew what what was
[53:54] causing her to act the way she acted.
[53:58] You know, we get too much encompassed
[54:01] sometimes with the result instead of the
[54:04] cause. And if we could ever get to the
[54:07] root of the problem, then all the things
[54:10] we're battling. So you can battle the
[54:13] symptoms all you want. And our messenger
[54:15] used to say, what you've got is a bad
[54:17] case of symptoms.
[54:19] You know what I mean? You can't treat
[54:21] the symptoms, you know, and that
[54:24] comforts, but if you could ever get to
[54:26] the cause, there could be healing. Well,
[54:29] so we found out that he spoke to us by
[54:34] fulfilling
[54:35] the prophecies that were spoken.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? So Christ is
[54:41] revealed in his own word. He's speaking
[54:44] to us today
[54:47] because we are here today. We are not
[54:50] trying to live in the time that our
[54:53] messenger was here bringing this message
[54:56] that we have. He was in actually he was
[55:00] in the day of rejection.
[55:04] We are in the day of acceptance.
[55:09] We were called to accept what has been
[55:13] rejected. And that's why we bear the
[55:16] reproach that we bear because people
[55:19] have already passed judgment on it.
[55:21] They've already said it was false. They
[55:24] already said he wasn't a prophet. They
[55:26] already rejected what he taught and his
[55:30] revelations. But you are the people of
[55:32] acceptance.
[55:34] And because that you've accepted it, you
[55:37] have eyes that you can see and you're
[55:40] seeing what that he prophesied coming to
[55:44] pass. So you're living in the day and
[55:47] you are the people of the fulfillment of
[55:51] the prophecy.
[55:53] He said there would be a bride. He said
[55:56] there would be a bright age. He said
[55:58] there would be a people called out. He
[56:00] said that there would be a people
[56:02] separated. In fact, his word called for
[56:05] total separation from unbelief. So, it's
[56:08] not like that's something we ought to
[56:10] do. No, God didn't say there ought to be
[56:14] a sun or there ought to be light or or
[56:18] there ought to be this or there ought to
[56:21] be that. No, he said there let there be
[56:23] light. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; And there was light. And he said, "Let
[56:27] there be this." And and that came to
[56:29] pass. And so he said, "Let there be
[56:33] separation." So he was going to separate
[56:36] the sheep from the goats. So there was a
[56:40] time of separation. There was a time of
[56:44] calling out. There was a time when the
[56:47] people would see the word of God coming
[56:51] to pass and they would separate
[56:54] themselves to the word of God because
[56:58] they see him standing in his word. They
[57:03] see the fulfillment of the word. And so
[57:06] when you can start to uh uh uh place
[57:10] yourself
[57:12] in the position that you are, we are not
[57:16] ought to bees.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; You understand? We have a desire in our
[57:22] heart to be what God said that we were
[57:25] to be. And if we live below that, then
[57:29] we have a right to seek from him the
[57:32] grace, mercy, and power to transform us.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz God has transforming power. Every
[57:41] one of us here today, no matter what
[57:44] condition you're in, no matter where
[57:47] you've been, if that seed is in you, God
[57:51] does not impute uh a sin to you because
[57:55] the seed of God remains in you and he
[57:58] has cleansed us from all sin and
[58:01] unrighteousness.
[58:03] Yes.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; So it it we we
[58:08] got to come to the place where we're not
[58:11] standing on the outside as observers.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; But now we become participators
[58:19] of the fulfillment.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; So I want to participate in the
[58:23] fulfillment of the prophecy
[58:28] &gt;&gt; that's given to you to do that.
[58:32] That's your inheritance.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; I think that did that go over your head.
[58:44] That's your inheritance
[58:46] &gt;&gt; to be participants in the the the
[58:50] prophecy in the participation. We are
[58:53] now joint hes.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; We are now sitting in heavenly places.
[59:00] So we are we are the people that he
[59:03] chose and elected and placed in this
[59:07] building this morning other places
[59:10] across the world. People that have heard
[59:12] the cry and now have applied the Isab
[59:16] and are seeing what's spoken coming to
[59:20] pass. So we are in the day of the
[59:23] fulfillment. We are the people of
[59:27] fulfillment. We have the eyes to see
[59:31] what was spoken.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; How many knows the Jews
[59:36] didn't see him because they were
[59:39] blinded?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; If they would have known who he was,
[59:44] they would have never crucified him.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; They would have went right on into the
[59:50] millennium. They would have had the King
[59:51] of Kings sitting on their throne. They
[59:54] would have ruled the world. It would
[59:56] have been wonderful. But for us poor
[59:59] little sinful worthless Gentiles, he
[1:00:03] blinded the eyes of those that he loved,
[1:00:06] chose a redemption path for them, and
[1:00:09] came and purged us of our sins.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like it. Don't you?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God's wonderful.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:00:21] And so, he speaks here. He says, "Now my
[1:00:24] text this morning is Christ revealed in
[1:00:26] his word,
[1:00:28] his own word." So he's not revealed in
[1:00:31] my word. He's revealed in his own word.
[1:00:34] Don't drop that part out of there
[1:00:38] because there's some things we'll talk
[1:00:40] to you in a little bit. But I cannot
[1:00:43] draw a picture of the Lord
[1:00:47] and try to get you to believe it. He
[1:00:49] won't reveal himself in my identity.
[1:00:54] I remember I met a a sister once. Well,
[1:00:57] I'll just tell you who it is cuz they're
[1:01:00] good friends of mine. It was uh Sandy
[1:01:03] Peterson.
[1:01:05] I I don't think Ron listens, but he'll
[1:01:07] probably hear this one. So, Sandy, you
[1:01:10] know, we love you, me and Lesie. But I
[1:01:13] met Sandy Peter the first time, and she
[1:01:14] looked at me, she said, "Are you David
[1:01:16] McGary?" I said, "Yes."
[1:01:18] Are you sure you are David McGary?
[1:01:23] Well, you know, Sandy, she she's uh uh
[1:01:28] she uh I say, "Well, she made me wonder
[1:01:31] whether I was my who I thought I was."
[1:01:35] And I said, "Yeah, I'm David McGary."
[1:01:37] She said, "Well, that's strange. I
[1:01:38] thought you were six foot tall with one
[1:01:40] eye and a scar on your face and was an
[1:01:42] ogre."
[1:01:46] Well, obviously, you know, she might
[1:01:48] have been right. I don't know. But uh
[1:01:51] but you know, so you can't be a a what
[1:01:55] somebody else's picture is.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And and let me say this, you can't be
[1:02:01] the Christian that other people want you
[1:02:04] to be.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; You can't let them draw your life for
[1:02:09] you. You can't you can't let them beat
[1:02:12] you down and say if you were a Christian
[1:02:14] you would do this and if you were a
[1:02:16] Christian and you were a Christian.
[1:02:19] That's how the Nickelodeon spirit
[1:02:21] captured the church and robbed the
[1:02:24] church from their freedom is everybody
[1:02:27] kept trying to be what everybody else
[1:02:29] wants them to be.
[1:02:32] God made you to be what he created you
[1:02:36] to be
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; and he put that seed in you and that
[1:02:42] seed has the ability to transform to
[1:02:46] exactly what it was planted to transform
[1:02:49] to be. Now you've got to trust that
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; because if not fear will start to rule.
[1:03:01] And there's so many principles. But
[1:03:03] let's go and continue to read here.
[1:03:07] He says,
[1:03:10] he says, now where I come to this
[1:03:14] conclusion to talk on this, knowing that
[1:03:18] what we say, we must just say it because
[1:03:22] we're gathered together to just a
[1:03:26] haphazardly speak on anything.
[1:03:29] So we didn't come here today because we
[1:03:32] gathered together just to haphazardly
[1:03:36] speak.
[1:03:38] You understand? If that all I would have
[1:03:40] to do is say four or five buzzwords, you
[1:03:42] know what I mean? And and just say what
[1:03:45] we already believe and play some really
[1:03:48] good music and we would jump and have a
[1:03:51] little hoot nanny and then we would
[1:03:53] leave
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; and we would have had a nice time.
[1:04:00] So, I noticed that here's Ben and
[1:04:04] and Clever singing and and they know
[1:04:07] there's two girls watching them.
[1:04:14] You know what I mean? And so, they might
[1:04:17] as well put them together in one thing.
[1:04:19] So, and and there they are. you know,
[1:04:22] and I I just heard those hearts
[1:04:23] pitterpattering all the way across the
[1:04:26] country to my office, you know. So, uh
[1:04:32] you know, I got in trouble because I
[1:04:34] announced that I was going to uh uh
[1:04:38] Harrari and I didn't
[1:04:42] think about people streaming.
[1:04:45] And all of a sudden, poor sister Vongai
[1:04:48] got a phone call. Why didn't you tell me
[1:04:50] he was coming? Well, I told her not to.
[1:04:55] And she got in trouble cuz I let it out
[1:04:57] of the I guess let the cat out of the
[1:05:00] bag. I think they call it, don't you?
[1:05:03] But so we just don't say it. But listen
[1:05:05] to what what our pre messenger saying to
[1:05:08] us. He says he says just to say
[1:05:10] something, but it's something that will
[1:05:14] help stabilize
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; the people.
[1:05:20] So that's what we if this was his
[1:05:23] purpose this morning. I I want to take
[1:05:27] the message that he made that statement
[1:05:30] and bring a thought this morning to help
[1:05:33] stabilize us.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So that's what we're after.
[1:05:39] For we are going to pass through
[1:05:41] dangerous, treacherous waters.
[1:05:46] We're already sailing through them. And
[1:05:49] sometimes I guess it's with you like it
[1:05:53] is with me that seems that it's so much
[1:05:58] of it. It's such a scare.
[1:06:03] And so we want to be stabilized
[1:06:06] because remember Satan will try to shake
[1:06:10] you down.
[1:06:12] When Jesus paid for Peter, he Satan
[1:06:16] Satan desired to shake you and sift you
[1:06:20] like the sand. And you've got to be
[1:06:23] ready for when he comes and attacks you
[1:06:27] and shakes you and tries to break down
[1:06:31] your confidence, break down your mind,
[1:06:34] break down your spirit, make you feel
[1:06:37] unworthy, make you feel that it's not
[1:06:40] worth pressing forward, make you have a
[1:06:43] feeling that you're hopeless, that
[1:06:46] you're worthless, and you're not a part.
[1:06:49] Remember, there's one thing about Satan.
[1:06:53] He is a liar.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; There is no truth in him.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; He can't tell the truth. Don't believe
[1:07:04] the lie. Believe what he said. That
[1:07:08] settles it. So we we want to we want to
[1:07:11] be stabilized. And and so we realize
[1:07:15] that we are in the day of the pale horse
[1:07:19] rider. If we were to look through the
[1:07:21] church ages, we were to look at what was
[1:07:24] revealed in the book of Revelations, how
[1:07:27] that Satan was going to go forth and
[1:07:29] attack us, right? How he came down, how
[1:07:33] he started the deception, how he went
[1:07:36] out on a white horse, you know, just
[1:07:38] acting gallantly. And then he just kind
[1:07:41] of started putting his little lies.
[1:07:45] So what he did, he he came out like like
[1:07:48] a like a saint. And then he added this
[1:07:51] little creed and he sprinkled this
[1:07:53] little doctrine in there and he started
[1:07:56] working the people to start to conquer
[1:07:58] him. And then he went out as a a red
[1:08:02] horse. Right. Right. Then red. And and
[1:08:06] then that red horse enforced
[1:08:10] what he was doing. And anybody could
[1:08:13] that stood up or had a revelation, he
[1:08:16] slayed them.
[1:08:20] And then he began to charge a penny and
[1:08:22] a wheat and he began to he began to sac
[1:08:27] to institute
[1:08:29] a method of redemption other than
[1:08:32] acceptance.
[1:08:35] And people started to try to work their
[1:08:38] salvation up. And the minute you tried
[1:08:41] to gain salvation and you tried to work
[1:08:45] for salvation, it's just like me right
[1:08:48] now. If you saw me start looking for my
[1:08:51] glasses,
[1:08:52] have you seen my glasses?
[1:08:57] I've got them all the time.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It's It was in me. I had it. But now
[1:09:05] I've been deceived.
[1:09:08] I've been mocked. I've been enforced.
[1:09:11] And now I no longer look.
[1:09:15] And so that was conquered. Then then he
[1:09:19] went out as a black horse
[1:09:22] and he brought everybody
[1:09:26] under
[1:09:28] his darkness.
[1:09:30] He had he had the interpretation of the
[1:09:33] Bible.
[1:09:34] He had created what system the church
[1:09:37] was in. Everybody that came out of
[1:09:41] Christianity or had any claim to
[1:09:43] Christianity was a member of one of his
[1:09:46] daughters and it's all we knew.
[1:09:51] And I'm not I'm not going to go on
[1:09:53] because I'd love to right now because
[1:09:54] this I just love these, you know, I'd go
[1:09:57] into all the four uh beasts that combed
[1:10:01] all those, but that would be a whole uh
[1:10:04] sermon morning in itself. But then
[1:10:06] finally came the pale horse and that was
[1:10:10] a mixture of all those things together.
[1:10:14] The author of confusion
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; to to make it so milky
[1:10:21] and to make it so with so many aspects
[1:10:25] and and uh scenarios,
[1:10:29] you know, I talk to people and and
[1:10:32] they've got, well, what if what if this
[1:10:34] happens and what if that you'll never
[1:10:36] get nothing done.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I hate it when guys just sit down and
[1:10:40] take an hour and a half to discuss 15
[1:10:44] different ways to do something. Do
[1:10:46] something and if it's wrong, we'll fix
[1:10:48] it. Of
[1:10:51] course, I'm the one paying, so I want it
[1:10:53] done in a hurry, you know.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is now. He He
[1:11:00] doesn't want us to stabilize.
[1:11:02] He doesn't want us to have something
[1:11:04] that we can be anchored to that that
[1:11:08] we're not going to be tossed to and fro
[1:11:10] with every wind of doctrine. We're going
[1:11:12] to be anchored solid in the word of God.
[1:11:15] We're going to know who we are, where we
[1:11:18] stand, and what's going on around us.
[1:11:21] And we're going to be looking for the
[1:11:23] soon coming and catching away of the
[1:11:26] bride. And we're going to enter into
[1:11:28] that earthly and that beautiful union of
[1:11:33] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:11:35] bride in that great union that we are
[1:11:39] supposed to now have in our hearts.
[1:11:44] So if we're not careful, we'll spend all
[1:11:48] of our lives trying to get the scenarios
[1:11:50] and the confusion and all those things
[1:11:53] put together and they're not even part
[1:11:56] of our picture.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Those pe they're not that's not the
[1:12:01] puzzle we're trying to put together.
[1:12:03] There's only one picture we have and
[1:12:06] that's God's word.
[1:12:09] So we we want to be we want to be
[1:12:13] stabilized.
[1:12:15] And we preached the last Sunday a little
[1:12:18] bit to about leaning not to our own
[1:12:22] understanding.
[1:12:24] And that theme carries over into this
[1:12:27] this morning, how you can't rely on what
[1:12:30] you figure out.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; And we'll touch on that in a little bit.
[1:12:36] And and so we we we use the terminology
[1:12:41] of a life coach or a mentor,
[1:12:46] right? Or as we would say, an example.
[1:12:50] So we found out that the word of God is
[1:12:53] our guide.
[1:12:55] We've never been down this path before.
[1:13:00] No matter what, you can't use things
[1:13:03] that are are are are of yester years
[1:13:08] in the hour that we're living in.
[1:13:11] And we kn know know that that
[1:13:13] denominational message doctrines and
[1:13:16] creeds cannot meet the challenge of the
[1:13:20] hour. They can't meet and battle what
[1:13:24] we're facing
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; because we're facing a a a pale horse
[1:13:30] devil that appears as an angel of light
[1:13:35] and would deceive the very elect if
[1:13:38] possible.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And we're all mixed together.
[1:13:48] Now, I don't know who is and who isn't.
[1:13:51] And so instead of using this church, we
[1:13:54] will use the three churches on this
[1:13:57] block. So one church is unbelievers, the
[1:14:00] other churches make believers, and we're
[1:14:03] the believers.
[1:14:07] And if you want to take it a little more
[1:14:10] closer to home, that's up to you.
[1:14:15] So you you understand that he's saying
[1:14:18] these are perilous times. So there's got
[1:14:21] we've got to be able to stabilize
[1:14:25] in these times that we are and to be
[1:14:28] able to to anchor in the storm, to go
[1:14:33] through the mental battles, to go
[1:14:35] through the battles that that our flesh
[1:14:38] presents us. to be able to get up when
[1:14:41] our shortcomings come up and we fail and
[1:14:45] know that there's something within us
[1:14:47] that's driving us.
[1:14:51] I remember when I saw the Ten
[1:14:54] Commandments
[1:14:55] for the first time and
[1:14:58] there's one scene in that that moved me.
[1:15:01] It's Moses. He's he's pushing into the
[1:15:04] storm and the wind's blowing and he's
[1:15:07] got his ride. He's he's going forward
[1:15:10] and he said he didn't know whether to
[1:15:12] curse or bless. That's which was driving
[1:15:15] him.
[1:15:19] Now I believe this morning that all of
[1:15:21] you have something in you despite your
[1:15:25] battles that's driving you.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't believe that you would have
[1:15:32] came
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; this morning. It might be a still small
[1:15:36] voice. It might be a little flicker in
[1:15:40] darkness, but there's something in you
[1:15:43] that's beginning to cry out that wants
[1:15:46] to come to life.
[1:15:49] And just like there there's something in
[1:15:51] you that you want to be better, you want
[1:15:53] to be closer to God, you want to know
[1:15:56] the truth. And I think that's the best
[1:15:59] thing that a man can do is somewhere in
[1:16:02] his life is sit there and look around
[1:16:05] and look at his circumstance. Look at
[1:16:07] his friends. Look what he's involved
[1:16:09] with. Look what he's messed with. And
[1:16:11] ask himself, is there any truth
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; in all this?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Because we know that it's the truth that
[1:16:22] sets us free.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And I know what the truth is. I am the
[1:16:29] way, the truth, the life, and no man
[1:16:32] cometh to the father but by me. The Lord
[1:16:35] said,
[1:16:39] So we want truth
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and and and and
[1:16:45] the truth is what he said
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; because the spoken word
[1:16:54] is the original truth.
[1:16:58] He we just read the scriptures. He's the
[1:17:00] one by his word the power that brings
[1:17:03] all things to pass.
[1:17:05] So we we recognize where we're standing.
[1:17:08] So I wanted to play third just 13
[1:17:12] minutes
[1:17:14] this morning
[1:17:16] and he's going to talk a little bit in
[1:17:19] here and and write and and you can go
[1:17:23] home. That's the beautiful thing about
[1:17:24] this is I'm only playing 13, but you can
[1:17:28] go back and and read it and listen to it
[1:17:31] and find even more within it than I'm
[1:17:35] bringing out. My theme this morning is
[1:17:38] let's go. What secrets is he speaking?
[1:17:42] is our coach, our life coach, our
[1:17:44] leader, our mentor, our leadership want
[1:17:48] wanting us to to take this morning to
[1:17:52] stabilize us.
[1:17:56] Now, you got to stabilize the ship.
[1:18:02] So,
[1:18:03] but he's going to talk and it's a it's a
[1:18:06] a subject that he's going to give for
[1:18:11] a way to relate
[1:18:15] what a a real
[1:18:19] heartfelt
[1:18:21] love is.
[1:18:23] and he's gonna talk in this, but I'll
[1:18:26] let him tell the story, but I want I,
[1:18:29] you know, uh, he lays it in in just a a
[1:18:33] way, but he's talking about a a man
[1:18:36] that's going to marry a girl
[1:18:39] and he realizes that that girl would be
[1:18:43] happier with somebody else.
[1:18:49] yet she would marry him
[1:18:52] if he wanted.
[1:18:54] Now, they're not married.
[1:18:57] Okay? And I notice he picked that right
[1:18:59] up, so he had to address it.
[1:19:02] But what kind of love does he have in
[1:19:06] his heart
[1:19:08] that he would be willing to let go of
[1:19:13] the thing that he loved
[1:19:16] in order to make that
[1:19:20] girl he loved happy?
[1:19:25] So he had to have the motive and
[1:19:28] objective and the purpose. And he wants
[1:19:33] to take that and relate that to what is
[1:19:38] it in our heart that we love most.
[1:19:45] And that's where we'll pick up after we
[1:19:48] listen. So it's just 13 minutes. But in
[1:19:51] this, I want you to grab a hold of the
[1:19:55] fact that if you you're in God, you
[1:20:00] always were there,
[1:20:02] that you're a part of him.
[1:20:06] Now, if you're a part of something,
[1:20:09] that opens an avenue
[1:20:13] to you
[1:20:16] to ask
[1:20:18] and to receive.
[1:20:20] Because there is a connection
[1:20:24] and it goes back beyond where you are in
[1:20:27] this life. It's an eternal connection
[1:20:31] you have with God. And that eternal
[1:20:35] connection
[1:20:37] has to be what stabilizes us. So, if you
[1:20:41] would bear with me, uh, I I hope not in
[1:20:46] my folly, but I I know I'm going to play
[1:20:50] 13 minutes. I know that some will
[1:20:52] criticize me for not playing the whole
[1:20:54] thing. Some will, you know, uh, but I
[1:20:59] I'll tell you, it's like he said, he
[1:21:02] said, I read this because my words will
[1:21:05] fail, but his words won't fail. So no
[1:21:08] matter what I preach, I know these 13
[1:21:11] minutes won't fail.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; So you can take from it whatever you
[1:21:15] personally get from it. And I can only
[1:21:19] share with you my revelation.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I know that you say, "Well, what are you
[1:21:24] preaching for?" Because there's
[1:21:26] something inside of me that burns.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God didn't build the church on
[1:21:32] my He build the church on you the
[1:21:36] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:21:39] you. And that's what the Holy Spirit is.
[1:21:42] It's the personal revelation. It's going
[1:21:44] to talk about the spirit and what it
[1:21:46] really is. And I I hope this 13 minutes
[1:21:49] is a blessing. Then we'll just speak on
[1:21:52] a few little subjects to help stabilize
[1:21:54] us. And I hope you love and trust the
[1:21:57] word of the Lord. And I hope we leave
[1:21:59] here today a better Christian, more
[1:22:01] determined, knowing
[1:22:04] that our sins are under the blood and
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:08] some glad morning
[1:22:11] when this battle's over,
[1:22:14] the flying saucers
[1:22:16] going to pick me up.
[1:22:19] And that that'll be a a glorious day cuz
[1:22:22] that what we're living for. Amen. Enjoy
[1:22:25] these uh few minutes. Listen close. But
[1:22:29] he's going to describe
[1:22:31] where you come from. God bless you.
[1:22:39] And last Sunday when we was going into
[1:22:41] those cycles
[1:22:43] uh about how that the five senses on the
[1:22:46] outer rim,
[1:22:48] that's the inlet. Five senses to the
[1:22:50] body. There's only one way you can get
[1:22:52] into the body. That's by those five
[1:22:53] senses. See, taste, feel, smell, and
[1:22:55] hear. There's no other way to contact
[1:22:56] the vi the body. On the inside of that
[1:23:00] man is a man called spirit.
[1:23:03] And he has five senses. Think, thought,
[1:23:06] and uh thought and love and conscience
[1:23:08] and so forth. All right. Now, you can't
[1:23:11] think with your body. You think with
[1:23:12] your mind.
[1:23:14] And in there is where
[1:23:17] too many of Christians only stop.
[1:23:21] And they can just like the corn in the
[1:23:24] field and the weed in the field, they
[1:23:26] can be anointed with the same Holy
[1:23:28] Spirit that the real believers anointed
[1:23:31] with. But down on the inside of that
[1:23:35] next rim, the third rim is the soul
[1:23:40] and that's predestinated by God. There's
[1:23:43] where the real seed germ lays is in
[1:23:46] there.
[1:23:47] And remember, if I take a culka bur and
[1:23:50] cut it open, draft into it the heart of
[1:23:53] a of a wheat and put it there, bury it,
[1:23:57] it would bring forth a wheat out of the
[1:24:02] cocoa bear. No matter what the outside
[1:24:04] is, what the emotions today so confused
[1:24:07] about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:09] so forth. Satan can impersonate any kind
[1:24:11] of a gift that God's got.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; But he cannot bring that word word by
[1:24:17] word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; That's where he failed in the Garden of
[1:24:20] Eden. That's where he's always failed.
[1:24:21] That's where them the tape on false
[1:24:23] anointed ones are anointed ones. They
[1:24:26] can be anointed with the spirit, speak
[1:24:27] in tongues, dance, shout, preach the
[1:24:29] gospel and still a devil.
[1:24:33] It's the inside.
[1:24:35] Now remember Jesus said, "All the father
[1:24:38] has given me will come to me. No man can
[1:24:41] come except my father draws him first."
[1:24:45] Now we taken through the lesson to show
[1:24:46] that in you were in your great great
[1:24:51] great grandfather all the way back
[1:24:53] physically speaking.
[1:24:55] Then
[1:24:56] that's what you are in physical being
[1:24:59] natured. Sometimes a child will be born
[1:25:01] in a family red-headed. It astonishes a
[1:25:05] father because there's nobody he knows
[1:25:06] of his people redhead or the mothers.
[1:25:09] But if you'll go way back to several
[1:25:10] generations, you'll find out somebody
[1:25:12] was redheaded. That seed keeps coming on
[1:25:15] down and you come the nature of one from
[1:25:19] way back. like because Hebrews 7th
[1:25:22] chapter said that Melzdc
[1:25:26] Abraham paid ti to him when he's
[1:25:28] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:25:29] kings and Levi who received tithe paid
[1:25:33] tithe for he was in the loins of Melzdc
[1:25:37] at or the loins of Abraham rather when
[1:25:38] he met Melzdc. Now
[1:25:41] the same thing is this. If you are a son
[1:25:46] of God and if I am a son of God or a
[1:25:49] daughter of God, we were in God at the
[1:25:52] beginning.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus became the fullness of
[1:25:57] the word,
[1:25:59] then we were in him germ form.
[1:26:03] When he was crucified, we was crucified
[1:26:06] in his body.
[1:26:08] When he rose from the dead, we rose with
[1:26:11] him. And now since we have recognized
[1:26:14] it, now we sit together with him in
[1:26:17] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. See,
[1:26:21] for he we if we are sons and daughters
[1:26:25] of God, we are God's children.
[1:26:29] Then we are attributes of God. Then we
[1:26:31] were got eternal life. And God is the
[1:26:34] only eternal life there is. Then we were
[1:26:37] in him from the beginning.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus became all that word,
[1:26:43] then we were part of him then.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are. That's in there.
[1:26:49] There's no devil, no powers, no nothing
[1:26:51] can ever move it. That's a tie post of
[1:26:54] the soul. You can be anointed out.
[1:26:55] You're in this spirit and desire and do
[1:26:57] all these other things. But when it
[1:26:59] comes to this high post to that word,
[1:27:01] you'll never move from that whole right
[1:27:03] study and true to that word as it can be
[1:27:06] outside of that regardless of what you
[1:27:08] do. You're still lost.
[1:27:10] That lady you see in church age naked,
[1:27:12] blind, miserable, don't even know it.
[1:27:15] It's out anointed, anointed with the
[1:27:17] real spirit. See that Holy Spirit can
[1:27:19] fall upon a man in his spirit.
[1:27:24] But his soul is his germ.
[1:27:28] That germ is the word.
[1:27:31] See, and how I don't care how much you
[1:27:34] preach, how well you do this, and how
[1:27:36] much you love, that's one of the inlets,
[1:27:38] the spirit. You can't love with your
[1:27:40] body. You love with your spirit. That's
[1:27:42] one of the inlets. And you can love and
[1:27:44] even love God. Still not be right.
[1:27:48] You can cast out devils and preach and
[1:27:49] do these things still not be right.
[1:27:51] Jesus said so that many would come in
[1:27:53] that day. That word settles it. In the
[1:27:57] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:28:01] with God and the word was God and the
[1:28:03] word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:28:07] Notice I'm going to speak on this
[1:28:09] subject of the Bible of Christ revealed
[1:28:12] in his own word. Where I draw this
[1:28:14] conclusion is in my room. Some dear
[1:28:17] person may be sitting here this morning.
[1:28:19] I got a picture hanging in my study up
[1:28:21] there. That's a picture of Hoffman's
[1:28:24] head of Christ wrote in the biatitudes
[1:28:27] and right where you would come the place
[1:28:29] like you need a part of the hair they
[1:28:31] press a little harder on the pen as you
[1:28:32] pass that part. There he is sitting in
[1:28:35] his word looking right out. Christ in
[1:28:38] the biatitudes someone ever who it was.
[1:28:40] I thank you for it. And somebody brought
[1:28:42] that picture in, put up my study there
[1:28:44] of Elijah going up in a chair in a fire.
[1:28:46] We appreciate these things. Many times
[1:28:48] big crowds, I just don't get a chance to
[1:28:50] speak and say these things, but I see
[1:28:52] it, brother, sister. I I know it. God
[1:28:55] knows it. Now, I'm going to speak on
[1:28:57] this subject of Christ revealed in his
[1:29:00] own word. How in the biatitudes there
[1:29:03] stands a picture of Christ standing
[1:29:05] right out. That's where I thought of
[1:29:07] this subject.
[1:29:09] Now Christ and the word is the same.
[1:29:14] See you say how was the Bible? People
[1:29:16] says us riding with a man not long ago.
[1:29:20] He said think of it. We here on this
[1:29:22] earth the way we are and we only know or
[1:29:26] can only say that we're saved by some
[1:29:28] Jewish fable
[1:29:30] called the Bible. I said, "Sir, I don't
[1:29:34] know how you say that, but I don't
[1:29:36] believe it's a Jewish fable."
[1:29:39] I said, he said, 'Well, you pray. What
[1:29:40] do you pray to? I asked for so and so
[1:29:43] and certain things. I didn't get it. I
[1:29:45] said, you pray wrong.
[1:29:47] We should never pray to change God's
[1:29:49] mind.
[1:29:51] We should pray to change our mind. God's
[1:29:54] mind don't need any changing.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; It's right.
[1:29:59] I said, ' Not what you prayed for. Know
[1:30:01] a young Catholic boy one time was had a
[1:30:03] prayer book saying prayers for his
[1:30:05] mother to live and she died and you
[1:30:06] throw the prayer book in the fire. Well,
[1:30:09] see, I don't go for the prayer book. But
[1:30:13] anyhow, see, you take the wrong
[1:30:15] attitude. You're trying to tell God what
[1:30:17] to do. Prayer should be Lord, change me
[1:30:22] to fit your word, not change uh uh not
[1:30:27] let me change your mind.
[1:30:29] You changed my mind. See, you changed my
[1:30:32] mind to your will. And your will is
[1:30:35] written here in the book. And Lord,
[1:30:37] don't don't let me go till you got my my
[1:30:39] mind set just like your mind. And then
[1:30:42] when my mind is set like your mind, then
[1:30:44] I'll believe every word you wrote. And
[1:30:46] you said in there, you make everything
[1:30:47] work together for good to them that
[1:30:49] loves you. And I love you, Lord. It's
[1:30:50] all working together for the good. I've
[1:30:54] been this week down in the country
[1:30:55] standing with some very dear friends. I
[1:30:56] asked some of them at the table
[1:30:58] yesterday when we was eating. We always
[1:30:59] sit around have a little like a little
[1:31:01] study on the Bible to talk about love.
[1:31:04] There's a certain person said to me, he
[1:31:06] said, "I believe you're an antichrist."
[1:31:08] I said, "If that would be pleasing to my
[1:31:11] Lord, that's what I want to be. I want
[1:31:14] to be whatever he wants me to be. I love
[1:31:18] him. And if he should cast me into hell,
[1:31:21] I still will love him if I go with the
[1:31:23] same spirit I have now." He looked at me
[1:31:26] kind of strange. I seen four or five of
[1:31:27] them there. Young men, young wives, fine
[1:31:30] women. I noted how that boys love their
[1:31:32] wives. So I said to them, I said,
[1:31:35] "Here's a way to test it. If your wife
[1:31:38] before you were married, now you go
[1:31:40] back. Say you this married life, you've
[1:31:42] been dreaming you were married. You
[1:31:44] really wasn't married, but you dreamed
[1:31:46] you were. And you woke up and you went
[1:31:48] and talked to your girlfriend and said,
[1:31:50] "You know, I dreamed that we were
[1:31:52] married. We had children. We living
[1:31:53] happy and and waiting for the coming of
[1:31:55] the Lord and everything. And then this
[1:31:57] girl would say to you, you know, I love
[1:32:00] another man better than I love you. I
[1:32:03] could be happier with the other man.
[1:32:05] Could you from your heart
[1:32:09] love her well enough to say, "God's
[1:32:12] blessings rest upon you, my dear. Go
[1:32:15] with this other man." Now, now check
[1:32:19] that each of you man. Are you winning?
[1:32:22] See? Well, if your love is correct,
[1:32:27] you do that.
[1:32:30] Boy, you are interested in her welfare.
[1:32:34] What you know, you could have her. You
[1:32:35] can live with her. You, she's your wife.
[1:32:37] She will be, she'll marry you, but she
[1:32:39] won't be happy.
[1:32:41] She'd be happy with and then if you love
[1:32:43] her, then you want her to be happy.
[1:32:47] Therefore, whatever the will of God is,
[1:32:49] let God's will be done. whether I'm
[1:32:51] happy with it or not.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; I want to live so he will be pleased
[1:32:59] with what I do. Therefore, check your
[1:33:02] your objective and your motive by that
[1:33:04] you know where you love God or not. What
[1:33:06] if you'd say uh you serve me but I'm
[1:33:08] going to cast you away. I love you
[1:33:09] anyhow.
[1:33:13] Therefore, if the churches would see
[1:33:15] that and could believe it in that
[1:33:17] manner, it wouldn't be one trying to
[1:33:19] jerk the football away from the other
[1:33:21] fell when he's running with it. He'd be
[1:33:22] protecting that one.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; When real true motive and objective
[1:33:28] would be one trying to say, "Hey, I got
[1:33:30] this, too. This is me and this." See,
[1:33:32] God can't use a man. So much
[1:33:34] impersonation follows it. And that's
[1:33:36] Satan. And the people can't realize that
[1:33:39] you're trying to take the ball from
[1:33:41] somebody's been given. Let God raise up
[1:33:43] a certain ministry and watch how many
[1:33:44] goes after it. See, see now genuine love
[1:33:48] for God. No matter what part I am, Lord,
[1:33:50] if I can only say a word for it, help
[1:33:52] protect it. Let me do that.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing it would be about
[1:33:57] your wife. If you really love her,
[1:34:02] see, it's not a it's not a a filio love.
[1:34:05] It's an agapo love, a genuine love. she
[1:34:09] could live with somebody else happier.
[1:34:12] You're not married now. Of course, you
[1:34:13] can't. And by the way, people listen to
[1:34:16] these tapes. Some so many sins in said,
[1:34:18] "Well, in the marriage and divorce, you
[1:34:20] said this and you said that." I've said
[1:34:22] that so many times. These tapes goes
[1:34:26] only I'm speaking to my congregation,
[1:34:30] brother. I'm not responsible for what
[1:34:32] God gave you to shepherd. I'm
[1:34:34] responsible for what kind of food I feed
[1:34:36] these people. This is for this
[1:34:39] tabernacle only. See, now if the people
[1:34:42] want to listen to the tapes, that's up
[1:34:44] to them. But I'm speaking to what God
[1:34:46] has given to me. It was their sins that
[1:34:49] was omitted. Someone wrote out and said,
[1:34:51] "Well, I've done this and I done that."
[1:34:53] You said our sins. I I didn't say that.
[1:34:55] I said see it to this. This is only to
[1:34:59] this people right here. The people here
[1:35:02] in the tabernacle, my own flock. Now, if
[1:35:06] people wants the high breed food and
[1:35:08] stuff out there, you you get the
[1:35:10] revelation from God and do what God
[1:35:12] tells you to do. I'll do the same thing.
[1:35:14] But these messages are to this church.
[1:35:18] Notice how we come back. We've got to
[1:35:20] have something another that we have to
[1:35:23] hold on to.
[1:35:25] Something has to be a tie, folks. In
[1:35:28] other words, it's an ultimate.
[1:35:30] And everyone must have an ultimate
[1:35:34] or an absolute. I preached on it one
[1:35:36] time years ago on an absolute. A place
[1:35:40] that's the last word.
[1:35:46] Now, if that don't make you want to go
[1:35:48] home and listen to the rest of it, I
[1:35:50] don't know. But I I will say this. He He
[1:35:54] said, "I'm responsible for what kind of
[1:35:56] food I feed these people.
[1:36:00] I take that
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; pretty serious to heart. I have enough
[1:36:05] to answer for, but I certainly want you
[1:36:09] to be able to stand on that day and
[1:36:11] said, you know, I didn't know brother
[1:36:12] McGary was a scrown girl, but there's
[1:36:15] one thing I can say. He fed us the word
[1:36:17] of God for the hour. And I think that's
[1:36:19] what's so important. But I noticed that
[1:36:23] that
[1:36:25] he he wanted to point out when your
[1:36:27] motive and objective is right and you
[1:36:30] loved
[1:36:32] that girl. So he tried to bring it to
[1:36:34] something that would that we could feel
[1:36:39] what type of sacrifice
[1:36:44] it would be. That you loved her so much
[1:36:47] that you were willing to give up
[1:36:49] everything that your heart's desire was.
[1:36:54] Everything that you wanted, everything
[1:36:56] that you thought was important to you,
[1:36:59] everything that you had dreamed about
[1:37:03] and your love was so great that you
[1:37:05] would that you would want that person to
[1:37:08] be happy.
[1:37:10] And and then he even goes as far to say
[1:37:12] as I'm going to serve him even if I knew
[1:37:16] that he was going to send me to hell,
[1:37:18] I'd serve him anyway. Amen.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; He said if I feel the way that I feel
[1:37:23] now, in other words, the love that I
[1:37:26] have for him
[1:37:28] is not based on results of what I get.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; It's based on what he wants.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; So, we're not Christians to to so
[1:37:42] of a beneficial package.
[1:37:47] We ought to love him because he first
[1:37:50] loved us.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; That's what ought to be to grow a love.
[1:37:57] When a when a a man is attracted to a
[1:38:01] young lady or vice versa and and they
[1:38:04] love that person, they they they try
[1:38:07] they try to in such a manner to express
[1:38:11] that love. They might not just come out
[1:38:13] and say it, but she might twinkle the
[1:38:15] eyes, you know, or she might light up
[1:38:17] like a balloon when he comes around. But
[1:38:20] it's his love for her that wins her
[1:38:23] over.
[1:38:24] Or vice versa.
[1:38:27] You love because they first loved you.
[1:38:33] You know, always kid sister Lesie about
[1:38:37] her asking me to marry her.
[1:38:40] Well, I I take the fact that she dialed
[1:38:43] that number wrong that you know that's
[1:38:45] what started it. So,
[1:38:48] you know, so you know what can I say?
[1:38:56] Yeah. It just it just becomes something
[1:39:00] that he wants us to we're talking about
[1:39:02] being stabilized.
[1:39:05] You can't stabilize in doctrine.
[1:39:10] You can't stabilize in the intellect.
[1:39:13] You've got to know that he first loved
[1:39:15] you. And now what's he saying here? He's
[1:39:19] saying that you were in in your
[1:39:20] grandfather. You were you were in there
[1:39:24] in your physical.
[1:39:26] You showed up with physical
[1:39:29] characteristics
[1:39:30] that you can track down your natural
[1:39:34] gene seed line and those attributes have
[1:39:39] appeared.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; You you can see that. I get it all the
[1:39:45] time. Well, you know, Matthew looks like
[1:39:48] you. David looks like you. This, you
[1:39:50] know, he looks like you. Aaron, you
[1:39:51] know, everybody sees a little bit of me
[1:39:54] in the boys. sorry boys,
[1:39:59] you know, and they'll say Sharon looks
[1:40:01] just like her mother, you know, and
[1:40:03] she's beautiful
[1:40:05] and and so you you he's trying to
[1:40:08] stabilize you
[1:40:11] because the right mental attitude
[1:40:13] towards any promise of God's word will
[1:40:16] bring it to pass.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Okay? So he's trying to stabilize you.
[1:40:22] If your natural gene and attributes came
[1:40:26] down through your natural physical line
[1:40:29] because that germ seed was in your
[1:40:32] parents and it produced you what you are
[1:40:41] man is so disgusting.
[1:40:44] They want to g genetically engineer and
[1:40:48] so you can try to inject and get genes
[1:40:53] in change attributes. You know, they'll
[1:40:57] they'll one day they'll find the the
[1:41:00] little nose gene.
[1:41:03] So they'll wipe out my whole family
[1:41:05] trademark by just putting in a little
[1:41:08] nose gene in there.
[1:41:14] Well, if it ain't got a nose, it ain't a
[1:41:16] McGary.
[1:41:21] You know, you pick up that
[1:41:22] characteristic, right? And I'm talking
[1:41:25] lighthearted because I I want we're
[1:41:28] talking today about being stabilized.
[1:41:32] So, if that gene came through, if I look
[1:41:34] in the mirror and my mama, she would say
[1:41:38] to me, she would jump and I say, "What's
[1:41:40] wrong with She said, "I I just saw
[1:41:42] Mickey walk by and it was me." She said,
[1:41:44] "I saw your dad." You know, she would
[1:41:47] see my her husband in me. And it would
[1:41:50] catch her sometimes. Just a look, just
[1:41:53] the the way the eyes was, just a certain
[1:41:56] characteristic that that came out that
[1:41:59] was passed down. I didn't have any say
[1:42:02] in that,
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; but it showed up.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; And he said the same thing with you
[1:42:08] spiritually.
[1:42:11] that attribute's going to show up.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; He wants you to know that
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; if you were in him, you were in him in
[1:42:25] the beginning.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Let that
[1:42:31] part come out. Don't get some substitute
[1:42:36] of some emotional or some spirit, some
[1:42:42] somebody that somebody wants to give you
[1:42:44] an identity. My identity came from my
[1:42:48] physical gene and my spiritual identity
[1:42:52] comes from my spiritual father.
[1:42:58] And that seed,
[1:43:01] my father's germ,
[1:43:04] physical seed,
[1:43:06] had the ability to produce
[1:43:10] identifying characteristics.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; No wonder the prophet would say there's
[1:43:18] no big eyes or little.
[1:43:23] You know that.
[1:43:26] Praise God
[1:43:30] that you can be yourself.
[1:43:34] All these people waste all this time on
[1:43:37] this Hollywood garbage and they go buy
[1:43:39] millions and millions of dollars of
[1:43:41] paint to try to change what they are and
[1:43:45] they spill all kinds of money
[1:43:47] rearranging their face and they don't
[1:43:49] understand the all they're doing is
[1:43:52] losing who they really are.
[1:43:59] Since when do we want to be like the
[1:44:01] world?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; This. Now, that's what he's talking
[1:44:05] about here. This love
[1:44:08] that doesn't want you to be anything
[1:44:11] else but what he wants you to be.
[1:44:18] Now, that's what you love more than
[1:44:21] anything else. I love him so much. I
[1:44:24] love his word. I love what he did for
[1:44:26] me. I love who he made me. I see him in
[1:44:29] his word. I see what he said. I see it
[1:44:32] come to pass. I see him standing there.
[1:44:35] I know he's real. I see the prophecies
[1:44:37] of this day. I I heard about Malachi
[1:44:40] 4:5. I heard about Luke 17:30. I heard
[1:44:44] about the pillar of fire. I saw all the
[1:44:46] prophecies. But one day,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; it was standing there. the ministry of
[1:44:52] Luke 17:30, the son of man, God veiled
[1:44:55] in flesh. And I saw it
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; and I knew it was him
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; cuz he was standing in the fulfillment
[1:45:06] of the scriptures.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine that? You've got
[1:45:14] the germ
[1:45:16] spiritual
[1:45:18] seed, the eternal seed. He called it
[1:45:21] that was predestinated by God. God put
[1:45:25] it in there.
[1:45:29] That's pretty good.
[1:45:32] Okay. And so he put that part in there
[1:45:35] that that that germ part. It was
[1:45:38] predestinated. He said down on the
[1:45:40] inside the next realm, the third realm
[1:45:42] is the soul. And that's predestinated by
[1:45:45] God. There is where the real seed germ
[1:45:50] lays there
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; and you could take a cuckle.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Cuckleberg,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; but if he put
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; a wheat seed in that cucklebar
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; and you bury that seed,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; a wheat will grow from that cucklebar.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; If that germ seed is in you,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; you can dance, you can shout, you can do
[1:46:22] all those other things.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; That is no evidence
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; of one thing. It's all,
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; but if you got that germ seed, you love
[1:46:34] God's word.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; You're attracted to it.
[1:46:43] You hear it speak.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; He trying to woo you,
[1:46:51] call you, deal with you.
[1:46:58] The rain falls on the just and unjust.
[1:47:01] Thank God for the rain. But there's
[1:47:04] something deeper in you.
[1:47:08] It's a desire
[1:47:12] that I am going to
[1:47:14] live and follow the word.
[1:47:21] That's my
[1:47:23] ultimate.
[1:47:25] Everything has to have an ultimate. It
[1:47:29] has to have the last say so.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; It has to have the thing that makes the
[1:47:35] decision. Yes.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; He says whether it's a car, you know,
[1:47:39] you finally got to come down to why are
[1:47:41] you buying a Ford or buying a Chevy or
[1:47:44] buying a Der something
[1:47:48] that's the ultimate thing. And if it's
[1:47:51] money, the deal guy will make that money
[1:47:55] match what your ultimate is.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; He'll do what he can.
[1:48:01] If it's the car, then he knows that he
[1:48:04] can charge you whatever he can get out
[1:48:07] of you.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; How much can you pay a month?
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You really like this car? I think I can
[1:48:14] get it down to $540 a month for you. Oh,
[1:48:18] really? I really want that car.
[1:48:23] But if you walk in and said, "I don't
[1:48:24] need this car. In fact, you got one
[1:48:27] opportunity to give me your best price.
[1:48:29] I'm walking out. Well, let me go talk to
[1:48:32] the sales manager. You call me up.
[1:48:34] Here's my number when you get the best
[1:48:36] price. I don't got time for that stuff.
[1:48:40] I don't need a truck.
[1:48:44] Sales manager called me one time. What
[1:48:45] can we do, Mr. McGuri, to get you to buy
[1:48:47] a truck? Give me a price.
[1:48:51] Give me the right price. I'll buy it
[1:48:53] right now over the phone.
[1:48:57] It just depends. What's your ultimate?
[1:49:01] What is the thing that's driving you to
[1:49:05] make the decision? Is it a career? Well,
[1:49:08] what happens if God would call you to
[1:49:10] preach instead of some other career?
[1:49:13] Would you take it despite your
[1:49:15] weaknesses? Despite you think you'll
[1:49:17] never have peace until you embrace your
[1:49:21] ministry and start using it. You'll be
[1:49:25] miserable and no matter what you do
[1:49:27] because God called you to preach the
[1:49:29] gospel.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; You can run from it all you want. You
[1:49:37] can come up with every excuse in the
[1:49:39] world to run from it. Satan's got plenty
[1:49:42] of excuses.
[1:49:45] But when it comes to that word,
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; if you love him,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; no matter what it's going to cost you to
[1:49:54] obey that word, you'll take that word.
[1:49:57] Then you watch him come on the scene.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; He'll take care of you.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; If he sends you, he'll take care of you.
[1:50:12] I never graduated from high school.
[1:50:15] Well, I'm not here. I don't talk about
[1:50:17] myself much.
[1:50:19] I've got more complexes,
[1:50:22] more socially inept skills
[1:50:26] in everything.
[1:50:29] nothing that qualifies
[1:50:32] except for this in here.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I want to tell people about what he did
[1:50:40] for me.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I preach to people that don't even speak
[1:50:49] English.
[1:50:54] You We're not involved in this. It's
[1:50:56] him.
[1:51:00] your life is him.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's what have you connected
[1:51:07] with? What is your what when he said you
[1:51:12] look at that girl and you want her to be
[1:51:14] happy? The only thing that's in you is
[1:51:17] her welfare.
[1:51:21] He said, "Oh, I wish the church could
[1:51:23] get that."
[1:51:26] So when we
[1:51:28] Now, I'm going to make a big jump.
[1:51:31] I'm going to be under the presumption
[1:51:34] that everybody in here loves this
[1:51:37] message.
[1:51:40] No matter what battle you're going
[1:51:41] through
[1:51:44] physically, mentally, spiritually, the
[1:51:47] flesh warning against your spirit down
[1:51:50] on the inside, that predestinated seed
[1:51:54] loves God's word.
[1:51:58] and you've made the decision
[1:52:02] that I'm going to do what the word says
[1:52:05] regardless.
[1:52:08] May I just take my get on my soap box
[1:52:11] for a moment. That goes for communion
[1:52:16] and foot washing.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He said wash feet.
[1:52:25] Good enough.
[1:52:28] So, we understand now that we've already
[1:52:32] decided, I'm going to do take the word.
[1:52:37] Well, we know we have an adversary,
[1:52:40] right? We know there's a pale horse. We
[1:52:44] know that he's going to try to battle
[1:52:47] our minds because that's where the
[1:52:49] battle is. and to try to get us to go
[1:52:52] through all kinds of of sufferings and
[1:52:56] and
[1:52:58] mental trials.
[1:53:00] And now our messenger comes says, "I'm
[1:53:02] going to give you three secrets,
[1:53:06] three little things not to do
[1:53:11] to keep you stabilized."
[1:53:14] All right. I'm going to just talk about
[1:53:17] those three things because I'm speaking
[1:53:19] you to this morning as predestinated
[1:53:24] eternal seeds of God who love the word.
[1:53:30] And now our mentor,
[1:53:33] our coach, our spirit is going to tell
[1:53:36] us how you approach the word of God and
[1:53:40] not let you be drawn here or drawn
[1:53:44] there.
[1:53:46] He says the first thing is is you can't
[1:53:49] misinterpret
[1:53:50] the word of God.
[1:53:54] Okay?
[1:53:56] So, you can't make the word of God say
[1:53:59] something it doesn't.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, you can't take the
[1:54:06] scripture and use it to become the
[1:54:10] interpretation
[1:54:12] of something that you want to do.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; People will go back and they say, "Well,
[1:54:21] you know, they done this and they done
[1:54:23] that.
[1:54:26] And they use the word they they
[1:54:29] interpret the word of God by taking the
[1:54:33] scripture and creating a meaning for it
[1:54:37] and then their actions work on that
[1:54:40] meaning. Don't misinterpret the word of
[1:54:42] God. It says exactly what it says.
[1:54:51] You can stick with it because if you
[1:54:55] stick with his word, he will stick with
[1:54:57] you.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He will change the world for you.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; He created loaves and fishes.
[1:55:07] He had them cast their net on the other
[1:55:10] side.
[1:55:12] that widow might the gospel was preached
[1:55:16] around the world cuz she gave what she
[1:55:18] gave.
[1:55:22] You don't think that she was in every
[1:55:24] church service back in those days
[1:55:28] in every service that brothers would
[1:55:30] say, "Praise God, it's it's nice to have
[1:55:33] Sister Mike with us this morning."
[1:55:39] She was a part of it. her whole world
[1:55:42] changed. God will change the world for
[1:55:44] you.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Know that if God before you, who can be
[1:55:50] against you? Now you've got that love
[1:55:52] affair. Lord, it's your word. I'm going
[1:55:55] to do what your word says. I don't care
[1:55:57] the consequences. I don't care what the
[1:55:59] result is. I am staying with your word.
[1:56:03] I am not going to misinterpret the word
[1:56:07] for my situation.
[1:56:11] I'm not going to find a scripture
[1:56:14] and misinterpret it.
[1:56:17] So now that I can do something that I
[1:56:21] want to do and put some religious
[1:56:24] scriptural covering on it,
[1:56:27] stay with it.
[1:56:29] He'll reveal it to you.
[1:56:34] Accept it just the way it's spoken.
[1:56:37] Don't ever misinterpret the word. It'll
[1:56:41] keep you stable. The minute you start
[1:56:44] moving scripture and and interpreting
[1:56:46] scripture and everything, your whole
[1:56:49] ship gets out of whack. It's like taking
[1:56:52] all the cargo and putting it on the back
[1:56:54] of the boat or taking everything that
[1:56:57] you're doing and putting it all in one
[1:56:59] box.
[1:57:02] No, you take all the word of God. You
[1:57:04] don't misinterpret it. It will keep you
[1:57:06] stable. The word of God will balance
[1:57:09] your life. You can live a balanced life
[1:57:12] in an unbalanced world.
[1:57:17] The scripture will keep you down the
[1:57:19] straight and narrow. It'll give you the
[1:57:21] advice that you need.
[1:57:23] Stay with it. It's your stabilizer.
[1:57:28] The other thing you do is you don't
[1:57:29] misplace the word of God.
[1:57:33] You don't take it from one age to
[1:57:36] another.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; We've got to live by the word of God of
[1:57:41] our age.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; We stay. We don't misplace the word.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; We don't take the word out of context.
[1:57:55] We leave it in its realm.
[1:57:59] We leave it in its day.
[1:58:01] We have the scriptural promises for our
[1:58:04] day. When the when the world saw those
[1:58:08] scriptural promises, here was the Lord
[1:58:10] Jesus
[1:58:12] standing there in their presence
[1:58:16] revealing himself through his own word
[1:58:20] revehold
[1:58:22] in the last days I'll send you Elijah
[1:58:24] the prophet. As it was in the days of
[1:58:27] the son of man, so it shall it be. as it
[1:58:29] was in the days of Noah, in the days of
[1:58:32] the voice of the seventh angel, the
[1:58:34] mysteries of God should be revealed.
[1:58:36] Here he was standing in those
[1:58:40] scriptures.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; God veiling himself
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; in a prophet who will and Christ was
[1:58:49] using that prophet
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the word and reveal himself.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; You can't misplace. You can't take the
[1:58:59] scriptures out of the revelation for its
[1:59:02] day.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; All your Bible when you read it, it
[1:59:07] can't be misplaced. You can't read your
[1:59:09] Bible like you're in the days of Noah.
[1:59:12] You can't read your Bible like you're in
[1:59:14] the days of of of of
[1:59:18] Moses or Noah. Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; You've got to read the Bible in the
[1:59:26] light of where that you are. That you
[1:59:28] are the people that are here to fulfill
[1:59:31] God's word.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; You You understand? If you don't, you're
[1:59:38] misplacing the word.
[1:59:41] I'm taking this Bible
[1:59:44] and I'm going trying to go back 2,000
[1:59:46] years ago
[1:59:48] and look at Jesus as being somebody
[1:59:52] walking on the shores of Galilee.
[1:59:57] That don't do it. I've been there. I've
[2:00:00] been where he preached the sermon on the
[2:00:02] mount. I've stood in all those places
[2:00:03] with every other kind of Christian
[2:00:06] dressed any other way that you can't
[2:00:08] believe.
[2:00:10] And Christ wasn't in any of it
[2:00:13] because the only place that they would
[2:00:15] find Christ and the Lord Jesus is find
[2:00:19] it in the age. They can't misplace the
[2:00:22] scripture.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; So don't you try to misplace it. Don't
[2:00:29] let people try to use the scripture on
[2:00:33] you when they're taking it in another
[2:00:35] age. Oh, he died for everybody's sins.
[2:00:41] That's true. But he also came back and
[2:00:44] indicted this generation for not seeing
[2:00:47] him standing in his word.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; So when you see the word fulfilled, you
[2:00:53] see what was prophesied. You saw the
[2:00:56] prophecy, right? We heard the prophecy.
[2:00:59] Now we see the fulfillment. We know he's
[2:01:02] standing right in our midst revealing
[2:01:05] himself in his word.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; So we don't misplace it.
[2:01:15] You can't take it out of the age you're
[2:01:17] living in.
[2:01:20] Most of us want to live in the age of
[2:01:22] justification.
[2:01:27] I like justification.
[2:01:30] That's my favorite one.
[2:01:33] That's the one that forgives all my
[2:01:35] sins. I don't even have to be
[2:01:37] sanctified. Then
[2:01:42] I just keep it under the blood.
[2:01:45] But I'm misplacing it. I've got to go
[2:01:48] into sanctification.
[2:01:51] I got to move.
[2:01:54] Now all the scriptures apply to
[2:01:56] sanctification.
[2:01:57] Then then you then all the scriptures
[2:02:00] all the same scriptures that applied to
[2:02:02] justification then applied to
[2:02:03] sanctification. Then all the scriptures
[2:02:05] applied to sanctification in the
[2:02:07] resurrection. And now we're not even in
[2:02:08] that age.
[2:02:12] If a prophet came and preached the same
[2:02:14] message,
[2:02:17] the same idea, the same thought,
[2:02:22] no wonder he could take this and said,
[2:02:24] "This became a brand new book to me."
[2:02:26] Because now the scriptures were properly
[2:02:30] placed under the opening of the seals.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; You are living in the day of the open
[2:02:39] word.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; You are not living in justification. You
[2:02:44] are not living in sanctification. You
[2:02:46] are not living in Pentecost.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; You've risen way beyond that.
[2:02:54] So you can't take your life and try to
[2:02:58] misplace it. Too many people and they've
[2:03:00] spent a lot of time in the last few
[2:03:03] years trying to get this message back in
[2:03:05] Pentecost.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; And it was one of the things that he
[2:03:11] warned us.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every place that there's
[2:03:16] tongues, there's confusion."
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, there's nothing but a
[2:03:21] bunch. And everybody keeps saying,
[2:03:22] "Well, we believe in the movement of the
[2:03:24] spirit."
[2:03:26] Let the love of God be shed abroad in
[2:03:28] your heart by the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Watch the power of the capstone.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Watch the power of the capstone.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Watch the power of divine love. Watch
[2:03:43] the power of the right motive and
[2:03:45] objective. Watch the power when you when
[2:03:48] you take the prophet's reward and you
[2:03:51] believe every word that's spoken. Watch
[2:03:54] the power you have. It's more powerful
[2:03:57] than any shiver or shake.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; It's thus saith the Lord. You can stand
[2:04:03] still and watch God move mountains for
[2:04:05] you.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; The word of truth.
[2:04:13] Satan's always trying to get us to take
[2:04:15] it to some other age, some other spirit.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, they love the message until he says
[2:04:22] one of these flying saucers is going to
[2:04:24] come down and pick you up.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to admit that's rich.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; You guarantee that's every bit as strong
[2:04:37] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[2:04:39] blood.
[2:04:43] I'm willing to bear the reproach of the
[2:04:45] age,
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; the voice of the age, the voice of the
[2:04:49] time. I don't need to try to bring this
[2:04:52] message back into what other people
[2:04:55] think Christianity is.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Just the way he revealed it, just what
[2:05:04] he said. He revealed himself by
[2:05:07] fulfilling his word. God interprets his
[2:05:10] word by bringing it to pass.
[2:05:14] And the last thing to be stabilized. So
[2:05:18] I'm I'm talking about being stabilized
[2:05:19] this morning. So in other words, you're
[2:05:22] not going to be stable if you keep
[2:05:24] wanting this message to match up with
[2:05:28] some other age,
[2:05:30] some other spirit,
[2:05:33] some other way of worship.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; You'll be unstable.
[2:05:39] Can I say it this way? You got to be
[2:05:41] allin.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; This is the age you can't be lukewarm.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; You can't be mixing. You can't sit back
[2:05:50] and follow this message and hope it
[2:05:52] should just have a little more move of
[2:05:54] the spirit. It should have a little more
[2:05:56] of this and a little more of that and
[2:05:59] and if oh, if I could get it, I'm going
[2:06:02] to filter it so it's got just the flavor
[2:06:05] that I want, then I'll embrace it. No
[2:06:09] Lord, don't let me change your mind.
[2:06:12] You change my mind.
[2:06:15] You don't change to match up for what I
[2:06:18] want. Change me so I can be what you
[2:06:21] want.
[2:06:23] Now, if we could do these things,
[2:06:26] he's telling us our life coach, our
[2:06:30] mentor,
[2:06:31] the one who went through
[2:06:34] the reproach and the battle of this
[2:06:37] message firsthand.
[2:06:40] He's already fought this fight.
[2:06:43] He's been argued with, sat down, tried
[2:06:46] to be disproved, ran through the mill.
[2:06:50] ministers came through him, ministers
[2:06:52] meetings. He was offered all kinds of
[2:06:54] positions and jobs and everything. But
[2:06:57] what did he do? He stayed true to the
[2:06:59] one that called him.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't try to mix it up.
[2:07:06] He stayed true.
[2:07:09] He said, "Don't try to give an
[2:07:11] interpret. Don't try to make bring
[2:07:13] another spirit from another age.
[2:07:19] catch the spirit of our age. It's the
[2:07:23] eternal revealed word, the revelation of
[2:07:27] Jesus Christ.
[2:07:29] And the last thing he says, don't
[2:07:31] dislocate
[2:07:33] the word.
[2:07:35] May I say it this way? Because he said,
[2:07:37] if you miss if you dislocate the word of
[2:07:41] God, you'll put the body together wrong.
[2:07:47] You can't take a scripture,
[2:07:51] this scripture and this scripture, and
[2:07:54] put them together to make them say
[2:07:56] something.
[2:08:00] You can't just take this quote
[2:08:04] and this quote and take this quote from
[2:08:07] here and this quote and and dislocate
[2:08:10] them and join them together.
[2:08:15] You've got to leave them in its context.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; We have we have taken brother Bram's
[2:08:25] message and we've grabbed a quote from
[2:08:28] here and a quote from there and we've
[2:08:30] put this disjointed all these words and
[2:08:32] built these quotes and came up with
[2:08:35] whole kinds of things that aren't even
[2:08:38] in there. things he never said, things
[2:08:40] he never did, attitudes he never had.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you one thing about Brother
[2:08:49] Bam. He's the most humble, gracious,
[2:08:52] meekst, kindest man
[2:08:56] that this generation has ever known.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; He could know every rotten thing you do.
[2:09:07] He'd have hugged your neck, called you
[2:09:08] brother, he would have grabbed you by
[2:09:10] the hand without even you knowing it and
[2:09:13] casting devils out of you.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; He wasn't an exposer.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; He was a hider.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Perfect love hid a multitude of sin.
[2:09:29] I remember when I heard the story.
[2:09:33] Brother Brandham was standing behind the
[2:09:36] curtain with his Bible ready to go out
[2:09:39] and address the convention.
[2:09:42] And the brother got up and said,
[2:09:44] "Brother Brandon won't be with us
[2:09:47] because he's been called out on a sick
[2:09:49] call."
[2:09:54] And I'm glad it wasn't David McGary
[2:09:56] behind that curtain because I had to
[2:09:59] come blasting out behind that curtain
[2:10:01] go, "You liar,
[2:10:05] not him."
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; They said, "Brother Brandham, go." Oh
[2:10:09] no, brother. I'd never make that brother
[2:10:11] a liar. I'd never expose a fault. I
[2:10:16] would never do anything that would make
[2:10:19] him feel,
[2:10:21] you know, hurt his influence in any way.
[2:10:27] Well, I thought, come on,
[2:10:31] we're running after all kinds of things
[2:10:33] and here's the capstone being displayed
[2:10:37] to us right in before our face.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; We There's Christ standing in his word.
[2:10:45] revealing and we are
[2:10:48] dislocating
[2:10:50] the word of God,
[2:10:53] taking it all over the place. If we
[2:10:56] would just stay in context,
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; stay in the spirit of the age, stay in
[2:11:06] what our hope is,
[2:11:08] resurrection,
[2:11:11] being conformed to his image.
[2:11:17] If the same spirit that was in Christ
[2:11:20] Jesus dwell in us, it'll quicken our
[2:11:24] mortal body.
[2:11:26] And then we start living for the right
[2:11:28] thing.
[2:11:30] We're not tossed to and fro with every
[2:11:33] wind of doctrine,
[2:11:35] with everything that goes this way and
[2:11:39] goes that way. We're stable.
[2:11:44] God will interpret his word.
[2:11:47] Whatever he wants, I want.
[2:11:50] I want what he wants for this age. I
[2:11:53] want to be what he wants me to be. I'm
[2:11:56] not trying to be what everybody else
[2:11:58] thinks a Christian is.
[2:12:01] Because I'll guarantee you when he
[2:12:02] braided that belt and that whip and that
[2:12:06] cord and walked through that temple,
[2:12:09] they didn't think that was no young
[2:12:11] Messiah.
[2:12:15] And I'd hate to fall into the hands of
[2:12:18] an angry prophet.
[2:12:22] But we don't have to sweat.
[2:12:26] Let's let the attributes
[2:12:29] that our spiritual father put in us
[2:12:34] start to come to the surface and let us
[2:12:37] be who we really are,
[2:12:41] the children
[2:12:43] of God
[2:12:46] with the love of God shed abroad in our
[2:12:49] heart by the Holy Spirit. And these
[2:12:53] simple little things of not wanting a
[2:12:57] different time, not trying to put stuff
[2:13:00] together, but just living
[2:13:04] and waiting upon the Lord and having the
[2:13:09] attitude, not my will, but thy will be
[2:13:14] done. That'll birth Christ every time.
[2:13:18] God bless you this morning. Pray for me
[2:13:20] for our trip. We'll see you this
[2:13:22] evening. God bless you, brother Billy.
[2:13:32] Thank you.
[2:13:39] Amen.
[2:13:40] Thank the Lord for his word. Man, we
[2:13:44] we've taken the letter and left the
[2:13:46] spirit behind. Oh, if God could just
[2:13:49] fill us with his spirit this morning
[2:13:51] that we can have the same attitude that
[2:13:54] the prophet did and the same spirit that
[2:13:56] he did that he may dwell in us. Let's
[2:13:57] all stand. Amen. Let's sing. Thank you
[2:14:00] for the cross. A flat. Amen.
[2:14:05] Oh, thank you for the cross,
[2:14:10] Lord.
