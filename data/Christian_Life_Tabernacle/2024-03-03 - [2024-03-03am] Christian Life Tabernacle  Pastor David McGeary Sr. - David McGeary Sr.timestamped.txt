[17:25] heads commit the service to him heavenly
[17:28] father
[17:29] truly you have a wonderful Name Lord in
[17:33] it's in that name that all that you are
[17:35] is made known Lord all of your
[17:40] characteristics all of your thoughts all
[17:42] of your attributes all that you are your
[17:46] identity and Your
[17:48] Name Lord and that you have given us
[17:52] that
[17:52] name that we might have the opportunity
[17:55] to share in your characteristics
[17:59] and in your attributes and in your
[18:02] thoughts in all that you are Lord what a
[18:05] wonderful name it
[18:07] is Father you said that where two or
[18:09] three are gathered in your name there
[18:12] you are in the midst because you are in
[18:14] your
[18:15] name father we commit this service to
[18:18] you Lord we ask that it might be
[18:21] pleasing that you might put your name in
[18:24] this service Lord for outside of your
[18:28] presence since this is just another
[18:29] religious gathering of men Lord to
[18:33] fellowship with one another about the
[18:35] scriptures or the thought of the day or
[18:39] satisfy themselves with worshiping
[18:42] around their favorite songs but Lord if
[18:44] you aren't present in our midst all of
[18:46] that is in vain we commit the service to
[18:48] you that you would be present amen that
[18:50] you would be lifted up Lord that you
[18:53] would make yourself known and that your
[18:55] name could be found in this place we
[18:58] pray these things in jesus' name amen
[19:02] you may be seated just a
[19:04] minute I'm going to turn to Psalm 63
[19:07] this
[19:09] morning you know and uh oddly
[19:13] enough my mind has been on communion
[19:16] this
[19:17] week you know and uh something that
[19:19] certainly comes to mind as we start off
[19:23] a new month something that you know we
[19:27] begin to turn our hearts toward as we
[19:30] think on our next communion
[19:32] service you know each time we read that
[19:34] scripture out of 1 Corinthians 11 where
[19:37] Paul is instructing the
[19:39] Believers how they should be approaching
[19:41] the Lord's
[19:43] Supper you know you see Paul wasn't
[19:45] there when
[19:46] Jesus participated in this with his
[19:50] disciples he was still among the
[19:52] Pharisees sitting at gelo's
[19:56] feet what he describes in 1 Corinthians
[20:00] 11 was something that the Lord revealed
[20:02] to him years later and we read it every
[20:06] month 1 Corinthians 11 for I have
[20:09] received of the
[20:10] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[20:15] you but you know it's worth spending
[20:18] time in the scriptures of that night
[20:22] Matthew 26 and Luke 22 and what Jesus
[20:27] was dealing with his disciples
[20:29] about all that he showed them in those
[20:32] Final hours in that final night in John
[20:35] 13 through
[20:37] 19 you know and I always encourage
[20:40] everyone to spend some time looking at
[20:42] those as well as we begin to set our
[20:45] hearts toward
[20:47] communion but you see this supper wasn't
[20:50] for
[20:52] everybody you know this wasn't something
[20:54] he did openly in the synagogue on the
[20:57] Sabbath that
[20:59] you know everyone might participate but
[21:01] he took just a
[21:03] few those that were close to
[21:06] him and brought them into a little place
[21:09] set
[21:10] apart and asked them to join him in
[21:16] Fellowship when all the religious and
[21:19] cultural traditions of the
[21:22] day of the hour said that they would
[21:25] should be
[21:26] out with their own father's house
[21:29] celebrating the
[21:31] Passover but instead they were in this
[21:34] little place with
[21:36] him and he was sharing something with
[21:40] them that no one else had a part
[21:44] of ultimately even
[21:47] Judas could not remain in this
[21:50] place even though he had been part of
[21:53] the fellowship for
[21:55] years just a few chapters earlier in in
[21:58] Matthew 20 Jesus was asked by the mother
[22:01] of two of these
[22:03] disciples if he would grant them
[22:05] positions next to him in their
[22:07] Kingdom and he responded in verse 22 you
[22:11] know not what you
[22:13] ask and he challenges them are you
[22:16] able to drink of the cup that I shall
[22:21] drink of course they said that they
[22:23] declared they were able and he
[22:25] said You shall indeed drink of my
[22:30] cup you see he was inviting them to
[22:33] participate in
[22:35] something to be a part of
[22:38] something that night in that room what's
[22:41] interesting is rather than take the
[22:43] lamb which was the centerpiece of that
[22:48] meal a sacrificial
[22:51] animal he took the
[22:53] bread and he said
[22:55] this not the lamb
[22:58] represents my
[23:02] body you know when he was here his
[23:04] testimony of himself was
[23:06] never I am the Lamb of God it was I am
[23:10] the bread of
[23:12] life his Focus was on his bread and his
[23:18] cup and handed that to these men those
[23:22] who were with them with him in this
[23:24] intimate place and gave them an
[23:26] opportunity to be partakers of
[23:31] that but to participate in that
[23:34] offer you had to be in the room with
[23:38] him because if you were not in the room
[23:40] with him you were not a
[23:43] participant of that
[23:46] Fellowship you know and everyone else
[23:48] was out celebrating whatever religious
[23:52] or cultural motions were expected of
[23:54] that
[23:56] day but they were Miss missing entirely
[23:58] the
[24:00] offer that was being made to partake
[24:03] with him in his bread and his
[24:08] cup you know in
[24:12] communion you see communion is not about
[24:14] eating bread and wine drinking
[24:18] wine you know this isn't about
[24:20] performing our ritualistic checkbox to
[24:24] make sure that we drink enough cups of
[24:26] wine and eat enough loaves of bread to
[24:28] be sufficiently
[24:31] religious that's the
[24:33] case as we were fellowshipping with a
[24:35] couple folks the other night every
[24:37] Italian restaurant in town would be have
[24:40] us
[24:44] beat but we could stand in this line
[24:47] every single Sunday night and still
[24:49] never participate in
[24:53] communion you know every time we take
[24:55] that bread and take that cup we are
[24:59] declaring that we are sharing that bread
[25:01] and cup with him ourselves amen and that
[25:04] we are in communion with him
[25:07] amen we're giving witness that each of
[25:11] us individually are in that place in
[25:14] that little room sharing that communion
[25:17] with
[25:18] him not a good message believer not a
[25:23] good worshipper not a faithful church
[25:25] member not a student of the scriptures
[25:27] that understand understand all the
[25:28] secrets but someone who is in the room
[25:32] with him for
[25:35] themselves otherwise to take that bread
[25:38] and that
[25:39] cup is to give witness to something that
[25:42] isn't
[25:44] true we're going to read Psalm 63 this
[25:47] morning it's just a little short
[25:49] Psalm and this was on my mind as I was
[25:52] reading this it's a chapter about
[25:56] communion and it begins in verse one God
[25:59] Thou Art my God early will I seek thee
[26:05] my soul
[26:06] thirsteth for
[26:09] thee not
[26:11] church not a
[26:13] sermon not a worship
[26:16] service not an
[26:18] anointing not
[26:20] Fellowship my soul thirsteth for you for
[26:26] him
[26:28] my God not someone else's not the
[26:32] churches not the prophets
[26:36] mine my soul thirsteth for thee in a dry
[26:40] and thirsty land where no water is now
[26:42] notice what he says in verse two to see
[26:46] thy power and thy Glory so as I have
[26:50] seen thee in the
[26:53] sanctuary Lord I want to see your power
[26:56] and your glory the same way I see it in
[27:00] the
[27:01] sanctuary he's not saying I want to see
[27:04] your power and your glory in the
[27:06] sanctuary I want to see it the same as I
[27:09] saw it in the
[27:13] sanctuary he wants to see it for
[27:15] himself by
[27:19] himself you know we can all say that
[27:21] we've seen his presence we've seen his
[27:24] glory we've seen his movement in a
[27:26] church service
[27:29] but I wonder if we can say that we see
[27:32] him that way when we're not in a church
[27:37] service am I in that place am I in that
[27:40] little room of communion with
[27:43] him that I see him the same way there
[27:47] that I see in
[27:49] church or do I have to be in church to
[27:52] see
[27:54] him see I'm talking about communion
[27:59] because thy loving kindness is better
[28:01] than life my lips shall praise thee not
[28:04] because I'm in church not because of the
[28:07] music or the preacher or the worship
[28:08] leader but because your loving kindness
[28:11] is better than life my lips will praise
[28:15] you thus will I bless thee while I live
[28:19] this is how I will bless God this is how
[28:22] I will bless
[28:24] him I will lift up my hands in thy name
[28:29] his identity his work we just sang
[28:32] beautiful
[28:34] name what he wants done his attribute
[28:38] his work I will lift up my hands to
[28:43] that my hands will move under his
[28:49] administration this is more than just
[28:51] describing what I do in a church service
[28:53] when the music is playing and the people
[28:55] are worshiping what are my hands
[28:59] doing this is about what real communion
[29:02] looks like you know in Matthew 7 Jesus
[29:05] said not everyone that saith unto me
[29:07] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[29:09] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[29:13] My Father which is in heaven thus will I
[29:16] bless thee while I live I will lift up
[29:19] my hands unto thy
[29:22] name he goes on to say many will say to
[29:25] me in that day Lord Lord Lord have we
[29:28] not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[29:31] name have cast out devils and in thy
[29:33] name done many wonderful Works we've
[29:36] taken communion every
[29:38] Sunday and then I will profess unto them
[29:40] I never knew
[29:44] you there was no communion with
[29:48] him it was just folks doing religious
[29:52] looking things let's stand this morning
[29:55] as we read Psalm 63
[29:58] you know this is a Psalm of communion
[30:00] where it describes one who is in
[30:03] communion with him and you know my
[30:06] prayer for myself is that I am in that
[30:09] little room with him that I am in that
[30:12] little place with him because it's not
[30:14] about what I do but it's who I do it
[30:16] with amen and let's read that Psalm 63
[30:19] together oh God Thou Art my God early
[30:23] will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for
[30:26] thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry
[30:29] and thirsty land where no water is to
[30:32] see thy power and thy Glory so as I see
[30:35] thee in the sanctuary because thy loving
[30:38] kindness is better than life my lips
[30:40] shall praise thee thus will I bless thee
[30:43] while I live I will lift up my hands in
[30:46] thy name my soul shall be satisfied as
[30:49] with marrow and fatness and my mouth
[30:51] shall praise thee with joyful lips when
[30:54] I remember thee upon my bed and meditate
[30:56] on thee and the night watches because
[30:59] thou H has been my help therefore in the
[31:01] shadow of thy Wings will I Rejoice my
[31:04] soul followeth heart after thee thy
[31:06] right hand upholdeth me but those that
[31:09] seek my soul to destroy it shall go into
[31:12] the lower parts of the earth they shall
[31:14] fall by the sword they shall be a
[31:16] portion for foxes but the king shall
[31:19] rejoice in God everyone that sweareth by
[31:22] him shall Glory but the mouth of them
[31:24] that speak lies shall be stopped amen

[56:08] Isen
[56:10] that I didn't put my mic on today uh
[56:14] that last part of that uh verse
[56:17] sometimes is hard to believe isn't it
[56:20] that your life is in his
[56:23] hand uh maybe things aren't going too
[56:26] well or uh there's a
[56:29] challenge and you just can't see how God
[56:32] could be in it you know what I mean but
[56:35] yet he'll never leave you nor forsake
[56:38] you he'll be with you always so let's
[56:41] just bow our heads as we approach them
[56:43] this morning our gracious Heavenly
[56:47] Father your word testifies that you'll
[56:50] never leave us nor forsake
[56:53] us
[56:55] and we
[56:56] were taught so perfectly that the
[56:59] sunshiny Skies doesn't mean you're for
[57:03] us neither does the storm clouds of life
[57:07] mean that you're against
[57:09] us father our faith only has one place
[57:13] to rest and that's in the Eternal Word
[57:16] of God so father this morning we ask
[57:20] that you would bless us and break that
[57:22] word to us this morning in Jesus
[57:25] precious and holy name we pray amen amen
[57:31] if you have your Bibles uh uh if you
[57:34] turn over into uh
[57:38] Corinthians uh the uh 13th chapter of
[57:44] Corinthians and do I have that and
[57:48] they'll put this on me while you're
[57:49] finding
[57:53] that
[58:17] can you get a button
[58:21] up am I
[58:22] on I'm kind of like a child you know the
[58:26] scripture says unless you become like
[58:28] children and so you know they now I I
[58:31] need a lot of extra care you know I mean
[58:34] Lesley's always brushing food off of me
[58:37] and you know and and I never did like
[58:40] this part but you know like when your
[58:42] mom used to take spit and rub it on your
[58:46] hair to you know make you look better I
[58:48] just thought that was always so I
[58:50] thought that would go away but uh you
[58:54] know it it never goes away uh love
[58:57] always has certain
[58:59] characteristics doesn't it so we want to
[59:02] talk uh uh uh share we're going to
[59:05] listen to about 18 minutes of tape as a
[59:09] foundation and uh to our scripture and
[59:13] where we're going uh with this this
[59:16] morning because I believe there's great
[59:20] Wonders that lies ahead for the church
[59:24] and
[59:25] one of man's
[59:27] great uh mistakes is they always get
[59:32] ahead of
[59:33] God they they catch a glimpse of
[59:36] something or they feel there's something
[59:39] in the air and they run after it and
[59:43] they produce something that they feel is
[59:49] fulfilling that
[59:51] sense that they're feeling and then they
[59:56] gather around that and they say this is
[59:59] it but the this is the we know these
[1:00:02] great scriptures here as Paul is
[1:00:06] speaking and I guess it's worthwhile to
[1:00:08] read this wonderful chapter he says
[1:00:12] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:00:16] and angels and have not
[1:00:20] charity I am become a sounding brass or
[1:00:24] a tinkling
[1:00:26] symbol so Paul's moving the emphasis
[1:00:30] here if you could follow
[1:00:33] this and though I have the gift of
[1:00:38] Prophecy and understand all
[1:00:42] Mysteries and all
[1:00:45] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:00:49] that I
[1:00:51] could remove
[1:00:53] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:00:58] nothing now all these why is he
[1:01:01] emphasizing these things because these
[1:01:04] things have become measuring
[1:01:08] sticks okay Paul's trying to turn their
[1:01:11] eyes away from how they're measuring
[1:01:15] things and what they're measuring and
[1:01:18] get them back in
[1:01:20] Focus okay okay then he goes to explain
[1:01:25] a little bit about the
[1:01:28] character so you can have these things
[1:01:31] and not have this
[1:01:34] character right and this is where Paul
[1:01:36] wants to emphasize now charity suffereth
[1:01:40] long and is kind charity envieth not
[1:01:45] charity EV vanth not itself is not
[1:01:48] puffed
[1:01:50] up does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:01:54] seeketh not her own is not easily
[1:01:59] provoked I need to work on that public
[1:02:02] confession think thinketh no
[1:02:06] evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[1:02:10] rejoiceth in the truth Thy word is
[1:02:17] truth beareth all
[1:02:20] things believeth all
[1:02:23] things hopeth all things endureth all
[1:02:28] things charity never
[1:02:32] faileth once again
[1:02:35] now watch where Paul is moving the
[1:02:40] emphasis watch his
[1:02:43] warning against how that they are
[1:02:48] judging and
[1:02:50] determining
[1:02:53] spirituality charity never faileth but
[1:02:57] where there be
[1:02:59] prophecies they
[1:03:01] shall
[1:03:03] fail where there be
[1:03:06] tongues they shall
[1:03:10] cease where there be knowledge it shall
[1:03:14] vanish
[1:03:16] away how many knows that great
[1:03:18] knowledges of the past are no longer
[1:03:22] knowledges today
[1:03:27] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:03:32] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:03:36] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:03:42] done
[1:03:44] away now I want to hold that
[1:03:49] there uh with you okay cuz in other
[1:03:53] words if it says when that which is
[1:03:55] perfect is
[1:03:57] come now we have a lot of ideas on that
[1:04:01] the best that I can do this morning is
[1:04:04] you have to come to that answer yourself
[1:04:07] I'm going to share with you this morning
[1:04:10] what I
[1:04:11] feel what that which is perfect is and
[1:04:16] why the Capstone and love is such a part
[1:04:20] of it he said then that which is in part
[1:04:25] shall be done away when I was a
[1:04:28] child I spoke as a child I understood as
[1:04:32] a
[1:04:35] child I thought as a
[1:04:38] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:04:43] childish things now this is a loving
[1:04:46] rebuke of
[1:04:47] Paul he say putting your emphasis on
[1:04:51] these things is childish
[1:04:56] I used to think that way but I've become
[1:04:59] a man I've matured I've come into a
[1:05:04] greater Revelation and
[1:05:07] understanding okay so now I'm going to
[1:05:10] put
[1:05:12] away childish things so what is he
[1:05:16] saying the childish thing is he's saying
[1:05:20] because you judge things by tongues
[1:05:23] because you judge things by prophecy by
[1:05:26] you judge things by that and that that's
[1:05:30] childish you're missing the real way
[1:05:33] that you judge things for there's
[1:05:36] something of Greater
[1:05:38] Perfection that is
[1:05:40] coming hallelujah amen all listen he
[1:05:44] said he says for
[1:05:47] now we see through a glass
[1:05:51] darkling and as we don't fully
[1:05:54] understand these things they're obscure
[1:05:57] to us and when somebody doesn't see
[1:06:02] something
[1:06:04] ahead they have a tendency to cleave to
[1:06:09] where they're at or to the
[1:06:12] past when when they're when they're when
[1:06:15] it's not clear and they're going into
[1:06:17] the unknown they cleave to that what
[1:06:20] they know they hold on to the past they
[1:06:24] they don't want to venture
[1:06:32] forward we see but then face to
[1:06:37] face now I know in
[1:06:41] part but
[1:06:44] then but then so that but then
[1:06:49] means when that comes when that which is
[1:06:53] perfect is come
[1:06:56] then shall I
[1:06:58] know even as also I am
[1:07:04] known so he says and he cloes now
[1:07:07] abideth faith hope and
[1:07:10] charity these three but the
[1:07:13] greatest of these is Charity father we
[1:07:18] ask you to bless your word in your
[1:07:20] precious name we pray amen God bless you
[1:07:23] may be
[1:07:32] seated I I always feel that honesty is
[1:07:36] the best
[1:07:37] policy and uh uh so I'm going
[1:07:42] to try to be honest we've been uh
[1:07:47] studying and reading out of certain
[1:07:51] messages about the the the seed and we
[1:07:56] we've been talking about that life and
[1:07:58] that seed and the growth of that seed
[1:08:03] and and uh
[1:08:07] so you know I I I've never felt much
[1:08:12] that it's important to defeng
[1:08:15] yourself but I think it's you also owe
[1:08:20] your
[1:08:22] congregation
[1:08:24] explanations
[1:08:26] for why that you do what you do and the
[1:08:31] direction that you go in and I know
[1:08:35] there's lots of
[1:08:38] uh questions arise uh around certain
[1:08:43] times of the year and uh I've heard
[1:08:46] comments
[1:08:48] about our church and and myself that we
[1:08:54] don't believe uh in gifts and we don't
[1:08:59] believe in
[1:09:01] the uh baptism of the Holy Spirit and uh
[1:09:06] we don't believe in this or that now I
[1:09:11] believe in them okay I I I I don't think
[1:09:16] everything has to be a public
[1:09:18] display and I don't believe those things
[1:09:21] are only for the church house
[1:09:24] I believe it's important that the gifts
[1:09:26] are within the believer and they're
[1:09:29] within the church and there's been an
[1:09:32] order given to that but I I want you to
[1:09:37] understand why it is this morning that I
[1:09:41] don't
[1:09:42] pursue that
[1:09:45] Avenue you understand why I I
[1:09:49] don't emphasize it or try to create a uh
[1:09:54] uh uh uh uh the
[1:09:58] excitement over participating in
[1:10:02] that and I say this and I I I I'm not
[1:10:07] going to back my own self out I want you
[1:10:09] to listen to the
[1:10:11] messenger of the
[1:10:14] hour okay and and what that he's trying
[1:10:18] to point out to the people also what I
[1:10:22] feel
[1:10:24] that Paul was trying to point out to
[1:10:28] them there is a Perfection
[1:10:33] coming okay that is a a a
[1:10:39] wonderful uh Perfection above
[1:10:43] even uh what that we might perceive as
[1:10:48] being a move of the
[1:10:51] spirit and so we're going to start if
[1:10:55] you have uh uh some of you have I guess
[1:10:59] phones or tablets or some means of
[1:11:01] reading along we'll have it on the board
[1:11:05] but we're going to pick up in the
[1:11:08] message Harvest
[1:11:11] Time where uh brother brand was having a
[1:11:17] a uh
[1:11:20] discussion with a a Baptist
[1:11:24] Minister who felt that
[1:11:28] the that the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:32] was only for the
[1:11:35] disciples now I want to clearly make
[1:11:38] this
[1:11:39] clear the baptism of the holy
[1:11:43] spirit is not receiving the
[1:11:46] gifts the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:11:50] receiving the person of Jesus Christ
[1:11:54] amen that is the baptism of the holy
[1:11:58] spirit amen it's the personal revelation
[1:12:02] of Jesus Christ to you personally amen
[1:12:07] he has a
[1:12:09] presence he can be
[1:12:12] felt you can feel his touch you can feel
[1:12:16] his power he can do exceedingly and
[1:12:20] abundantly above that which you could
[1:12:22] even ask for thing he's the same
[1:12:25] yesterday today and forever and he's all
[1:12:33] powerful though as we read here as we
[1:12:37] pick up brother Ram's talking to this
[1:12:41] Baptist and he's pointing out to him and
[1:12:46] as we pick it up that there is a such
[1:12:48] thing as of the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:52] Spirit there is is an
[1:12:54] experience where you move from the
[1:12:58] intellectual into the reality of the
[1:13:01] presence of
[1:13:04] God you can believe something faith
[1:13:08] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:13:11] God you can believe
[1:13:14] something but faith is is the substance
[1:13:19] that brings that promise into reality
[1:13:23] amen you could say I believe in God I
[1:13:27] believe in this I believe in that that's
[1:13:32] belief belief and Faith are two
[1:13:34] different things that's right we can say
[1:13:37] I I we could give all the Litany of the
[1:13:40] things that we believe and not have
[1:13:43] faith but faith is the is the your
[1:13:48] heart's
[1:13:49] desire to make the word of God become
[1:13:54] real in your
[1:13:56] life let me say that again faith is your
[1:14:00] heart's desire to see the word of God
[1:14:04] become real in your
[1:14:07] life not on somebody
[1:14:11] else not the fact that you've seen
[1:14:14] it and the effects of it on somebody
[1:14:18] else but it's when you want it for
[1:14:22] yourself
[1:14:24] faith is a hungering it's a thirsting
[1:14:28] after the things of God it's a desire to
[1:14:32] have those things that are promised
[1:14:35] alive in your life and if there's
[1:14:38] anything that our messenger with the
[1:14:41] love that he had in his heart tried to
[1:14:44] get to the people was he's the same you
[1:14:47] can have these things in your life
[1:14:52] they're for you amen so he starts out
[1:14:55] where we're going to pick up and he's
[1:14:59] explaining uh and
[1:15:01] expressing to the
[1:15:04] Pentecostal uh church that he's
[1:15:06] preaching to is the need and necessity
[1:15:11] to move
[1:15:14] on okay he's not condemning where they
[1:15:18] are but he's trying to express to them
[1:15:22] that there there's
[1:15:24] something that we can move
[1:15:29] into don't set up
[1:15:32] camp you know keep
[1:15:35] pressing F he he's he's he's trying to
[1:15:38] make that
[1:15:40] evident evident to
[1:15:42] them
[1:15:44] that that there that they're that to
[1:15:48] move on that there was a life and a
[1:15:51] promise to move
[1:15:55] into so he's not just trying to say
[1:15:58] where you're at is no good that's not
[1:16:01] what he's saying but he's saying that
[1:16:05] God has something for you he has a
[1:16:10] something to move on
[1:16:12] into and don't
[1:16:16] stop and and that's that's what I'm
[1:16:20] trying to express to you is is that we
[1:16:24] don't want to create an
[1:16:27] Evidence or uh some sort of measuring
[1:16:31] tape that the spirit of God is with us
[1:16:35] we don't want to say the spirit of God
[1:16:37] With Us is because we run the spirit of
[1:16:41] God is with us because we shout the
[1:16:44] spirit of God is with us that this that
[1:16:47] that is exactly the same thing as saying
[1:16:49] Loy is here or Loy is there or all those
[1:16:54] things we don't want to
[1:16:56] miss what it is that God is offering
[1:17:01] could I use that expression to those
[1:17:04] that love
[1:17:07] him I'm not oppos to any move of the
[1:17:14] spirit as long as the believer
[1:17:18] himself doesn't set his temp tent up
[1:17:22] there and doesn't Camp there and claims
[1:17:26] because of it they have
[1:17:29] it that's
[1:17:32] right so we want to
[1:17:35] go and can and we go on so let's finish
[1:17:40] this great
[1:17:41] scripture here he says for now we see
[1:17:45] through a glass darking but when face to
[1:17:48] face I know in part but then shall I
[1:17:52] know
[1:17:53] even also as I am known and we'll we'll
[1:18:00] pick it up here now for 18 minutes
[1:18:03] that's not too long to listen to the
[1:18:05] message I when those 18 minutes are done
[1:18:08] I'll guarantee you I'm going to sit
[1:18:10] right there I want to keep
[1:18:12] going but but let's let's just feed on
[1:18:19] this and and let's let's hope that we
[1:18:23] can grab this in our heart that we all
[1:18:27] in here this morning can move on to
[1:18:30] Perfection these things shall we do if
[1:18:33] God permits but let us move on to
[1:18:37] Perfection uh as we pick this up if you
[1:18:40] have your phones we're going to start in
[1:18:43] uh paragraph
[1:18:48] 170 uh
[1:18:50] four uh of Harvest Time and we're just
[1:18:54] going to listen over to
[1:18:57] paragraph um uh the end I believe it is
[1:19:01] of of one uh uh 226 I believe it is so
[1:19:08] anyway Lord richly bless you as we
[1:19:10] listen to this wonderful
[1:19:12] message Harvest
[1:19:18] Time noise abroad there was all shouting
[1:19:20] and praising God they said man Brethren
[1:19:23] what can we do to be
[1:19:25] saved Peter said can't every one of you
[1:19:27] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:19:28] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:19:31] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:32] far the promise is to you and to your
[1:19:36] children and to them as far off even as
[1:19:39] many as the Lord are God so
[1:19:43] called heavens and earth will pass away
[1:19:46] but that word will never failed you
[1:19:48] Pentecostal pay no attention to the
[1:19:49] Methodist Baptist or Presbyterian you
[1:19:51] know that was forever
[1:19:53] generations and you pressed into it
[1:19:56] certainly now just don't stop pressing
[1:19:58] right
[1:19:59] there just keep on pressing see that's
[1:20:02] where methodists made their state they
[1:20:04] pressed into sanctification but stop
[1:20:06] Luther pressed into justification stop
[1:20:08] see then it organizes there it dies
[1:20:11] that's the end of it it's all of it
[1:20:13] watch now as we hurry up to when the
[1:20:16] spirit of true WID done he will teach
[1:20:18] you all things whatever taught you oh my
[1:20:23] bearing all remembrance to you what I've
[1:20:26] said to you bringing to you all the
[1:20:27] meance and he will show you things to
[1:20:30] come he will vindicate every
[1:20:34] word confirming the word with signs f
[1:20:38] everything that he promised that God
[1:20:40] promised in the Bible if you'll turn
[1:20:42] loose from every Creed and everything
[1:20:43] else and hold on to the word God is
[1:20:47] obligated to take care of his
[1:20:51] word and so when they did this the word
[1:20:54] vindicates itself he don't need somebody
[1:20:56] say well the days of Miracles has passed
[1:20:58] who's that man to tell me the days of
[1:21:00] Miracles is pass when I was once a blind
[1:21:02] man Hallelujah I once laid with the
[1:21:05] doctors give me three minutes to live
[1:21:07] and I'm living today how can they tell
[1:21:09] me any
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:13] different once the lukewarm Church never
[1:21:16] now f with the Holy Ghost God don't need
[1:21:19] any interpreter the spirit itself which
[1:21:21] is the word interprets it to be the
[1:21:23] truth if a man will dare to stand out
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:26] take he's his own interpreter try him
[1:21:29] one time and find out that this right
[1:21:30] don't payent what somebody else said do
[1:21:32] what God Said do what say I do this but
[1:21:34] what about the other every word one word
[1:21:38] breaks the chain that's where the
[1:21:40] churches always fail right on that chain
[1:21:42] they organize it get the thing together
[1:21:44] and make a big denomination these man
[1:21:46] get together Holy Father SE and so and
[1:21:48] Dr Bishop so and so and what's the first
[1:21:50] thing you have there you are you die
[1:21:52] right there we prove it by nature and by
[1:21:54] the word if the Lord willing in a few
[1:21:56] minutes all right bring into remembrance
[1:21:58] he vindicates every word and we live by
[1:22:01] it
[1:22:02] Hallelujah live by man shall live by
[1:22:04] every word every word Vindicated Jesus
[1:22:08] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:22:12] believe shall follow them that believe
[1:22:17] take a hold of it God vindicates it it's
[1:22:18] the
[1:22:19] truth where the seminaries and
[1:22:23] theologians inspired but Satan say you
[1:22:25] can't trust it that's for the apostles
[1:22:28] the days is passed there's no such thing
[1:22:31] that was only meant for the apostles to
[1:22:32] prove the gospel then we have learning
[1:22:34] people today they had better learning
[1:22:36] then we got
[1:22:37] now tell me any church to come up with
[1:22:40] that that
[1:22:41] sanin when their great great great great
[1:22:44] grandfathers had to be priests behind
[1:22:46] one crooked word in that and that
[1:22:49] scroller they stwn him part they had
[1:22:52] stay right exactly but they miss seeing
[1:22:54] the real kernel of the word when it
[1:22:56] comes the life that's why they were
[1:22:58] condemned and called the workers of
[1:23:00] Satan see that don't reflect the word of
[1:23:04] God when a Seminary Student tells you
[1:23:06] the Holy Ghost is not for today and
[1:23:08] these things all that Divine Healing
[1:23:09] stuff for some other days see it's not a
[1:23:11] reflection from God it's a reflection
[1:23:13] from a a Creed it's a reflecting from
[1:23:16] the doctrine it's outside the Bible
[1:23:18] Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same
[1:23:20] yesterday and forever St John 14:12 said
[1:23:22] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:23:24] do shall he do also now how you going to
[1:23:27] take that word out of there how you
[1:23:30] going to add something in this place you
[1:23:32] break the chain of Life man lives by
[1:23:34] Bread only the bre eternally he lives by
[1:23:36] that bread physically he lives by this
[1:23:38] bread there's the two bread the Holy
[1:23:42] Spirit the holy spirit is in you said
[1:23:46] amen to every word of God if that is the
[1:23:49] Holy Ghost I want to ask you something
[1:23:51] now this is that pinion
[1:23:53] part Mama used to give me cast a when I
[1:23:56] was a kid I can't stand the smell of
[1:23:59] this stuff yet we us raised poor and
[1:24:02] Mama borrow meat skins or render them
[1:24:05] out we get them down from an old sister
[1:24:08] named Goodman had a bakery down there
[1:24:10] she Bak hands and and render that out we
[1:24:12] get meal and take that grease and stuff
[1:24:14] and make our cornbread and we had poor
[1:24:17] eating no wonder we had malnutrition and
[1:24:19] so forth pling but Mom then every
[1:24:22] Saturday night we we didn't get the
[1:24:25] right kind of food so she make us all
[1:24:27] take a big ghost cast off and I just
[1:24:30] hold my nose and scream I said Mom it
[1:24:32] makes me so sick she said if it don't
[1:24:33] make you sick it don't do you any
[1:24:36] good so maybe that'll work this way now
[1:24:41] how I'm going to ask you something how
[1:24:44] can a man or a woman who claims to be
[1:24:47] filled with the Holy Spirit which is the
[1:24:50] word that right amen
[1:24:53] and how can you be the Flesh of that
[1:24:55] Holy Spirit as made you part of him to
[1:24:58] reflect the gospel of your age and deny
[1:25:02] the word that he
[1:25:05] wrote I don't care how good you are well
[1:25:08] I can take you to Africa to the the Hot
[1:25:10] Tops there and show you a life that a
[1:25:12] Christian can't touch even if they' be
[1:25:14] caught in adultery if one of the women
[1:25:17] before she's married a young woman she
[1:25:18] has to be test tested first for her
[1:25:20] virginy if she be found guilty just to
[1:25:23] tell what man did it and they're both
[1:25:25] killed together what if that happened in
[1:25:27] the United States who would bury all the
[1:25:29] cars see so but there you are see and
[1:25:33] they're
[1:25:35] heathens see the morale see so you can't
[1:25:39] test it with
[1:25:40] that our Indian brother here can tell
[1:25:43] you now the mohammad's probably have a
[1:25:44] lot better life than we ever think
[1:25:47] about but what is it it's the word that
[1:25:50] gives a test that Pharisees was twice as
[1:25:53] humble as Jesus he went around tearing
[1:25:55] up their churches and throwing them out
[1:25:57] and beating them out and everything like
[1:25:58] that this God the old preach you know
[1:26:01] well who was if I was having a meeting
[1:26:02] against him this morning I'd say who
[1:26:04] come to you when you were sick prayed
[1:26:07] for you that Godly old priest who long
[1:26:10] Papa that money when his crops fail that
[1:26:12] Godly old priest who dedicated you to
[1:26:15] God for a life of servant that Godly old
[1:26:17] priest who was it when he was in jail
[1:26:19] come and visit you that Godly old priest
[1:26:21] and this young Renegade called Jesus
[1:26:24] what does he do called your pastor a
[1:26:31] snake see it's not by the fruits it's by
[1:26:34] the word man shall not live by fruit
[1:26:37] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:26:39] out of the mouth of God and he was that
[1:26:42] word they just failed to see that's what
[1:26:44] he's supposed to do they couldn't sit
[1:26:47] because it wasn't ordain to sit that you
[1:26:48] can't come to me look at that poor Jews
[1:26:51] their eyes were blind blinded sure he
[1:26:53] did it he blinded himself think of how
[1:26:56] it would be to be blinded B be thanking
[1:26:58] God for what sight you got on the
[1:27:00] scripture now notice now he he was this
[1:27:03] word now after this he was tested Jesus
[1:27:07] tested now we're going through see it
[1:27:10] doesn't reflect the word When anybody
[1:27:11] says well that was for another age
[1:27:13] because the Bible said he's the same
[1:27:14] yesterday and
[1:27:15] forever how the Holy Spirit you could
[1:27:18] say that you are a filled with the Holy
[1:27:22] goost now it's going to hurt you a
[1:27:24] little bit is it all right raise your
[1:27:27] hand you won't be mad at me if you do
[1:27:30] you have to how can you win with bobbed
[1:27:33] hair telling you that you're filled with
[1:27:36] the Holy Ghost one
[1:27:39] word oh I spoke in Tong I don't make any
[1:27:42] difference I've seen Witch Doctors speak
[1:27:44] in Tong interpret that shock the spirit
[1:27:48] dance in the spirit how can you make
[1:27:52] call yourself ah head of the house and
[1:27:55] let your wife wear shorts and carry on
[1:27:57] the way
[1:27:58] she call yourself Christians how can you
[1:28:02] pastors ever face god with a thing like
[1:28:04] that without standing up and protesting
[1:28:06] you can't make them do
[1:28:08] it but if you get preaching like that
[1:28:10] you won't belong in the Seminary very
[1:28:11] longer with the gr you'll have to get
[1:28:14] cooperation from somewhere else we'll
[1:28:16] get into it just in a moment the Lord
[1:28:18] will see but there you are don't I don't
[1:28:20] mean to hurt you I love you that's the
[1:28:22] reason if you were floating down the
[1:28:23] river and I've seen you go to drown I'd
[1:28:25] be a poor fell say well be a good person
[1:28:27] honey you
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:32] better I said the other night if I'm a
[1:28:35] Christian I had to be identified with
[1:28:36] every character of the Bible I had to
[1:28:38] stand with Lord and preach with him in
[1:28:40] the days and warn the people right I had
[1:28:43] to stand on Mount carel alone with
[1:28:44] Elijah I had to stand at Calvary and be
[1:28:47] crucified to myself and my own Thoughts
[1:28:49] with him but then again I raised with
[1:28:51] him is triumph over all
[1:28:55] things all the caral of the carnalities
[1:28:57] that world raised above it in him notice
[1:29:01] it doesn't reflect the word then no it
[1:29:03] doesn't vindicate it now but if you
[1:29:06] believe the word God will vindicate
[1:29:08] himself as he did here in Jesus the word
[1:29:12] bread always means to be fed on and the
[1:29:16] man shall not live by bread like this
[1:29:18] bread alone but by every word so that's
[1:29:21] the word bread keep that in mind this is
[1:29:24] this bread that the church to every age
[1:29:27] has fed on has been the hidden Mana just
[1:29:30] for the Overcomer only Revelation said
[1:29:33] so am now I don't have time to break
[1:29:35] this whole thing down because I probably
[1:29:37] got another 30 minutes but look when the
[1:29:41] Holy when the Holy Mana fell from heaven
[1:29:43] which was a tie of the Holy Ghost you
[1:29:44] agree on that God told Moses to go out
[1:29:48] and get an R full of it and put it in
[1:29:50] the holiest of holies because if they
[1:29:52] didn't put it in the holies of holies it
[1:29:55] become stagnant is that right the worms
[1:29:57] got into it now he said but put it in
[1:30:00] the Hol of holies in this om that every
[1:30:03] generation coming up after that
[1:30:05] priesthood when a man becomes to go to
[1:30:08] the be a priest to minister the word the
[1:30:10] first thing he gets to do after he
[1:30:12] ordained is go in and get a handful of
[1:30:15] that origal man and eat
[1:30:18] it that was the represent that light in
[1:30:21] his hand in the new church age reflect
[1:30:23] in his life the Mana and only the man
[1:30:27] that's perfectly
[1:30:29] overcome the man that really sits down
[1:30:31] and throws aside everything else besides
[1:30:34] the word and the word is that Mana oh my
[1:30:38] it's Jesus man shall live by every word
[1:30:42] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:30:44] that's the hidden manner for the
[1:30:46] Overcomer oh that was laid up each each
[1:30:49] for each priesthood of following him the
[1:30:52] schools of theology long ago has swapped
[1:30:55] this blessed thing for a a mess of
[1:30:59] pottage exactly right yes sir like Esau
[1:31:03] did now Esau morally was a better man
[1:31:06] than Jacob but he didn't have respects
[1:31:09] to his birth rights which was the word
[1:31:12] how many knows that the birth Rights was
[1:31:15] the word the promise the Elder son but
[1:31:16] he was a good man moral man like the
[1:31:19] like the nominal Christian today a good
[1:31:21] man he didn't lie didn't steal he was
[1:31:23] good to his daddy he done all these
[1:31:25] things but you see his birth rights he
[1:31:27] said he didn't care about that what
[1:31:28] difference does that make I'm a
[1:31:30] Israelite anyhow see I I belong to it
[1:31:33] anyhow but it was his birth rights
[1:31:35] County see his natural was all right but
[1:31:37] his spiritual was all wrong so is it
[1:31:39] today the pottage mixed church and world
[1:31:43] together some of each one Bingo parties
[1:31:48] Dances all kinds of carrying on in the
[1:31:50] church shired women wearing shorts we
[1:31:54] say brother BR what's that little thing
[1:31:56] that's one of the words where the Bible
[1:31:58] said it it's wrong for a woman to cut
[1:32:00] her hair right if she does how she going
[1:32:04] to get
[1:32:05] in see just and preacher her tell you
[1:32:08] the word says that see she dishonors her
[1:32:10] head she dishonors her husband she
[1:32:12] should be
[1:32:13] divorced exactly right for she that will
[1:32:16] cut her hair there also be Shor off
[1:32:19] shaven if she wants to do that not with
[1:32:21] just Bob God don't want it that way
[1:32:22] that's that Myst in between don't fool
[1:32:24] with it either cut it all off or leave
[1:32:26] it grow that's what God Said any
[1:32:29] Minister the gospel knows that's the
[1:32:31] truth whether you understand it or not
[1:32:33] but that's the truth oh what good if you
[1:32:35] go do all the rest of it leave that go
[1:32:37] what this just a little bit of world of
[1:32:39] style into you trying to act just a
[1:32:40] little bit like the other churches
[1:32:42] that's exactly where Israel got in
[1:32:43] trouble that's where they died that's
[1:32:45] where Adam got in trouble that's where
[1:32:46] all the rest of them got in trouble just
[1:32:48] one
[1:32:50] word all what it Tak just one point
[1:32:53] pottage mixed with the world some of the
[1:32:55] world some of Hollywood some of the
[1:32:57] church some of the theologians and what
[1:32:58] you got notice if Satan fails here then
[1:33:03] he'll try a second scheme on getting you
[1:33:04] to to disbelieve the word and go to the
[1:33:07] sary of try the next scheme now here's
[1:33:10] where you want to be real careful and
[1:33:11] just set this for another five minutes
[1:33:13] on this part if you will then he makes
[1:33:16] you a supernatural offer I'm going to
[1:33:19] come back to all this just before
[1:33:20] closing he make see he can't tempt you
[1:33:22] away from the word you know I'm going to
[1:33:24] stay with the word then he'll give you a
[1:33:25] supernatural offering he said I tell you
[1:33:27] what you get up here and dive off the
[1:33:29] temple bring back up see show the people
[1:33:30] that you can do something
[1:33:32] Supernatural boy he got them there now
[1:33:35] watch this is watch when you get to the
[1:33:36] end where this temptation come maybe he
[1:33:39] might let some of you speak in tongue
[1:33:41] think you got it see or he might even
[1:33:44] let you prophesy though it not be with
[1:33:46] the word I see people stand up and
[1:33:48] prophesy with contr to the word is the
[1:33:50] East is and the West
[1:33:52] see it's the word that you live by them
[1:33:55] Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand
[1:33:56] him out the
[1:33:57] handful that don't mean one thing didn't
[1:33:59] Jesus say many will come to me in that
[1:34:01] day and say Lord have I prophesied in
[1:34:03] your name in your name I've cast out
[1:34:05] devil I've done Mighty works I've been a
[1:34:06] great man in the organization I've done
[1:34:08] all these things these things you say
[1:34:09] depart from me you that work iniquity
[1:34:12] what is Iniquity is something that you
[1:34:14] know that's right and you conceive it
[1:34:17] won't do it in your heart when you know
[1:34:19] that that Bible teaches a certain thing
[1:34:21] you won't do it that's iniquity and
[1:34:23] David said if I hide iniquity in my
[1:34:25] heart God will not even hear my
[1:34:27] pray is that truth is that the Bible now
[1:34:30] surely you couldn't get angry at that
[1:34:32] see Jesus said that many will come to me
[1:34:34] in that day and saying I've done all
[1:34:36] these things and I say depart you
[1:34:37] workers of iniquity same as did Adam
[1:34:39] Adam said Lord I did this I did that but
[1:34:42] one word one word did it that's all it
[1:34:45] takes this disobey one word this may be
[1:34:48] prophesied contrary to the word but now
[1:34:51] time he's got this Supernatural gift
[1:34:53] he's so carried away by The Noise by the
[1:34:57] glamour of it glory to God I prayed for
[1:35:00] so and so they got up and walked away
[1:35:02] Hallelujah I can speak in Tong and
[1:35:03] somebody interpret it's genuine the
[1:35:05] truth Paul said I can speak in tongue
[1:35:07] like man and angels and yet be nothing I
[1:35:10] can have faith to move mountains and
[1:35:12] still I'm nothing is that right but see
[1:35:15] he'll offer you that old Pentecostal
[1:35:18] people I love you I wouldn't be with you
[1:35:20] there's where you f
[1:35:24] what's the word not the gift what's the
[1:35:26] giver see where see where it comes from
[1:35:30] he's all carried away he's dancing in
[1:35:32] the spirit boy only thing he's got so
[1:35:35] many people around him everybody calling
[1:35:36] for him here and there he forgets the
[1:35:38] word or you're a very popper as long as
[1:35:40] you stay away from that word but you
[1:35:41] getting that word one time watch he's
[1:35:43] going to cooperate with
[1:35:44] you watch what comes out then we're
[1:35:47] going to get through this in another
[1:35:48] stage of nature in a moment see watch
[1:35:51] you who wants you then nobody does oh
[1:35:53] hands off for that like a certain
[1:35:55] Association gathered together here a few
[1:35:56] weeks ago and Bandon me any Ministry
[1:35:59] that come to the city Full Gospel would
[1:36:02] have me at the city to pray for their
[1:36:03] sick would be completely
[1:36:06] excommunicated from the
[1:36:09] association all right CL a pray for this
[1:36:12] all right don't hear it say and there's
[1:36:14] the word Vindicated that's the same
[1:36:15] thing theyve done with our Lord that's
[1:36:17] the same thing they done with every man
[1:36:18] in every age that's what they done with
[1:36:19] Luther Wesley and all that's what they
[1:36:21] done with you in the beginning now he
[1:36:23] turn right back to the same water you
[1:36:24] come out of notice way it's always been
[1:36:27] the same way it's never failed Satan
[1:36:29] does the same thing now he's so carried
[1:36:31] away by the noise of Glamour and so
[1:36:33] forth now he don't even pay attention to
[1:36:35] the word oh brother brother so and so
[1:36:37] said so and so and I got to go over here
[1:36:39] see he's just so carried away he don't
[1:36:40] even notice it whether it's word or not

[1:36:46] thein says boy you got it don't you let
[1:36:48] nobody tell you you got one see notice
[1:36:52] Satan ever had even then watching this
[1:36:55] one place here he quoted the word even
[1:36:59] on this Supernatural tried to get Jesus
[1:37:01] to do the supernatural see being had
[1:37:04] Supernatural what if Jesus would have
[1:37:06] listened to
[1:37:07] him see he said now wait you want to
[1:37:11] stay with the word do you you want to
[1:37:13] stay with the word said it's written to
[1:37:14] give his Angel's charge concerning this
[1:37:16] time Dash foot against Stone to BU up
[1:37:18] but he wasn't dashing his foot against
[1:37:19] those Stone see
[1:37:22] watch what if he would have stayed with
[1:37:23] it he do you know I never said he quoted
[1:37:25] the word he quoted quoted it like
[1:37:27] putting icing on a cage covered it over
[1:37:30] whitewashed it it wasn't its right place
[1:37:32] that's what they try to say today trying
[1:37:34] to whitewash it but you can't make it R
[1:37:36] with the rest of scripture it's got to
[1:37:37] be Everything Jesus Christ is name
[1:37:39] yesterday today and forever no matter
[1:37:41] how much words you try to quote that
[1:37:43] don't make it's got to be quoted just
[1:37:44] the way he said that if it's quoted
[1:37:45] right he Vindicated to be so in your
[1:37:47] life that's how all men know you're
[1:37:49] written Epistles read of God written
[1:37:51] Epistles is Bible is that right epistle
[1:37:54] is a Bible and you're written bible
[1:37:56] reflecting his word that perfect man
[1:37:58] again in God but Jesus said it is
[1:38:01] written
[1:38:02] also but notice Eve at this same stage
[1:38:06] Carried Away by her
[1:38:09] Supernatural I know we want to keep
[1:38:11] going I know I do
[1:38:15] but was that
[1:38:18] plain okay w how can we as
[1:38:25] Believers okay what our desire is is to
[1:38:29] be able to listen to this
[1:38:33] message and to look out and see
[1:38:38] it you know what I mean preceive it so
[1:38:42] what did he what what is the prophet of
[1:38:45] God telling
[1:38:47] us and and if we go on we know that God
[1:38:51] moved up through every age didn't he he
[1:38:54] said when he said when uh he said you
[1:38:58] Pentecostals you didn't pay no attention
[1:39:01] to the
[1:39:03] Methodist in other words when the spirit
[1:39:06] fell the restoration of gift cames you
[1:39:09] moved on from that right and then he
[1:39:12] said now the Methodist they didn't play
[1:39:14] pay any attention to the
[1:39:17] Lutheran when sanctification came they
[1:39:20] moved on from that okay they kept going
[1:39:24] they kept moving don't don't stop there
[1:39:28] so then he's he throws in here he's
[1:39:31] talking about a journey isn't he I I
[1:39:34] want you to look at what he's saying I
[1:39:36] mean I just played
[1:39:39] it but you you you've got to you've got
[1:39:43] to keep your
[1:39:45] life in a position where you can hear
[1:39:50] the word
[1:39:52] amen where every time the gospel's
[1:39:54] preached you don't fall into this
[1:39:57] conviction cuz you're so uh tied up in
[1:40:01] the world that every word of God becomes
[1:40:04] condemnation condemnation
[1:40:08] condemnation you're always wanting to
[1:40:10] wash your life and clean your
[1:40:13] life well you're going to wash the pain
[1:40:16] off the
[1:40:19] car you know you we we you we've got to
[1:40:23] move so that's why we want to keep our
[1:40:26] lives right is so that we can hear what
[1:40:29] he's saying so he's talking to the
[1:40:32] church he's telling him he's saying
[1:40:35] every time you start to move up Satan's
[1:40:39] got a
[1:40:40] trick he's got a battle if he can't use
[1:40:44] one scheme on
[1:40:45] you right if he can't say the days of
[1:40:48] Miracles has passed and and this he's
[1:40:51] got another one and it what is it it's
[1:40:54] the
[1:40:56] supernatural he'll use the
[1:40:59] supernatural the handing out of
[1:41:04] gifts the handing out of
[1:41:09] prophecies the the inspiration of
[1:41:15] emotion to do
[1:41:18] what to keep you from seeing
[1:41:21] the bread of the word and saying you've
[1:41:24] got
[1:41:27] it now it's
[1:41:31] happening I it's not happening because I
[1:41:34] said it's happening it's happening
[1:41:36] because God's Prophet said it was
[1:41:40] happening God's wanting to bring the
[1:41:42] church
[1:41:43] farther he's Wan him to get him the
[1:41:46] perfect
[1:41:47] union with the word of God and Satan
[1:41:51] says oh they can't get there let let me
[1:41:53] give them the
[1:41:55] supernatural let me give them power let
[1:41:57] me let let me let let let them start
[1:42:01] speaking in tongues and prophesying and
[1:42:03] and running and rejoicing and and saying
[1:42:06] we prayed for this person and they got
[1:42:08] well and we prayed for that person and
[1:42:11] and they got well and how did the
[1:42:13] prophet sum it up it doesn't mean a
[1:42:19] thing
[1:42:22] right and there's people all over this
[1:42:24] message flocking to it you know why
[1:42:27] they're flocking to it because they've
[1:42:30] abandoned the voice of God hallelujah
[1:42:33] they won't even play it in their
[1:42:35] churches because it'll condemn them
[1:42:38] right where they're
[1:42:42] standing oh if you don't know the truth
[1:42:44] you can't determine a
[1:42:46] lie that's
[1:42:48] right you can't you can't can't
[1:42:51] recognize
[1:42:55] deception so how can you a kingdom can't
[1:42:59] be divided against itself Paul's saying
[1:43:02] don't measure
[1:43:04] it by prophecy by
[1:43:08] tongues it'll fail that's right it's not
[1:43:11] what's
[1:43:13] perfect but when that which is perfect
[1:43:16] is
[1:43:19] come that which is in part will be done
[1:43:24] away let's just take a quick
[1:43:28] moment because that's what this church
[1:43:32] should be interested in and I don't mean
[1:43:34] Christian Life I mean this
[1:43:39] age they should be interested in the
[1:43:42] perfect bread word of God which is the
[1:43:47] Holy
[1:43:49] Spirit
[1:43:51] so the
[1:43:53] scripture plainly tells
[1:43:56] us it
[1:44:01] says he says but when that which is
[1:44:05] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:44:08] part shall be done away let's just
[1:44:11] follow that for a quick moment could you
[1:44:14] bear with me for a
[1:44:16] moment cuz I I want you to know my
[1:44:19] position
[1:44:22] I I want you to know I'm not
[1:44:24] against
[1:44:26] anything I'm only for what God's got for
[1:44:30] his
[1:44:31] church and I I don't want anything I
[1:44:35] don't want to be
[1:44:36] distracted by
[1:44:38] anything I don't want to be distracted
[1:44:40] by his church I don't want to distracted
[1:44:42] as someone coming up and saying oh where
[1:44:45] are all the
[1:44:49] Miracles some people couldn't see a
[1:44:51] miracle if it happened right in front of
[1:44:53] them the only Miracle they can see is
[1:44:56] Divine
[1:44:58] Healing which is the what
[1:45:04] least that isn't a great move of God
[1:45:07] that was taken care of at Calvary that
[1:45:09] just takes Faith by his stripes are
[1:45:12] healed it's already a completed work
[1:45:16] you're just accepting something that
[1:45:18] God's already done uhhuh uhhuh really
[1:45:21] Divine Healing is accepting the truth of
[1:45:23] the Gospel which was left out of the CH
[1:45:27] church but it's really accepting the
[1:45:33] past you understand what I'm saying it's
[1:45:36] accepting what Jesus did it's accepting
[1:45:38] the works that he did it's accepting the
[1:45:42] past that it is
[1:45:45] true but he's talking about something
[1:45:48] that's to come
[1:45:51] yeah he he's he's he's saying he's he's
[1:45:54] saying here in prophesying but
[1:45:58] then but then when this happens then
[1:46:02] I'll know so let's just go through it I
[1:46:05] I don't want to get I'm inspired but I I
[1:46:08] want to make it
[1:46:11] plain so when you get
[1:46:15] questioned and when they kind of lay it
[1:46:18] on you like they've got something you
[1:46:19] don't
[1:46:21] they've got a little
[1:46:22] whoop-de-doo that you don't
[1:46:27] have you know they got a little shiver
[1:46:30] and they want to know where your shiver
[1:46:32] and quiver is you stand there and say
[1:46:35] that scripture says that they put their
[1:46:38] finger in the nose of them that claimed
[1:46:39] to the apostles and were not and said
[1:46:42] you're not saying what the prophet
[1:46:49] said
[1:46:51] we're not built on a
[1:46:53] move we're built on the word of God the
[1:46:57] message of the
[1:46:59] hour that's what settles
[1:47:01] it the spirit is free to
[1:47:06] move but in every single one of those
[1:47:09] movements there's always two or three or
[1:47:11] four
[1:47:15] people that got to be lit on fire
[1:47:19] first
[1:47:21] they're the little leaders of the
[1:47:23] movement same people jump same people to
[1:47:27] the altar same people speaking in
[1:47:30] tongues and then everybody else is
[1:47:32] sitting around observing woo God's with
[1:47:39] us because nobody's
[1:47:42] pressing nobody's
[1:47:45] pressing everybody's waiting for the
[1:47:47] ministry to bring it to them
[1:47:51] everybody's waiting for a a message that
[1:47:54] stimulates you well I'm going to tell
[1:47:56] you something plain and
[1:47:59] simple the food is stored up on the
[1:48:05] tapes That's Where It's At that's where
[1:48:08] it is for this age that's where God
[1:48:11] chose to put it it's not historical word
[1:48:14] it's Eternal
[1:48:18] Word it doesn't make matter that he left
[1:48:21] the scene the truth of the Revelation
[1:48:24] was
[1:48:28] eternal bottom
[1:48:30] line and when anybody comes
[1:48:34] along and tries to express that we've
[1:48:37] got it in our
[1:48:40] church it's happening here come on move
[1:48:44] on
[1:48:49] over and and I sit back and I say yes
[1:48:51] there's two things going to happen
[1:48:53] you'll lose your voice and you'll gain
[1:48:56] 100
[1:49:01] lb what happened to the church what's
[1:49:04] happened to us when do we start
[1:49:07] measuring
[1:49:08] things by
[1:49:11] emotions when do we start shrinking back
[1:49:14] from the truth I'm not ashamed of this
[1:49:17] message cuz it's the power of God
[1:49:22] salvation it's what gets me through it's
[1:49:26] what will carry me to the end all those
[1:49:29] things are fine great wonderful
[1:49:32] Hallelujah but man does not live
[1:49:37] hallu by bread
[1:49:40] alone he don't live by that he lives by
[1:49:43] every word of God every word that
[1:49:46] proceedeth out of the mouth of God who
[1:49:48] was the mouth of God God to this
[1:49:52] generation under the angel of Lady oia
[1:49:55] write these things sayith the Lord I am
[1:49:58] the beginning I am the first and the
[1:50:05] last what did he say oh what was the
[1:50:08] problem we just heard him say it the
[1:50:10] church just decide to compare themselves
[1:50:12] and get a little
[1:50:14] worldly just get like all the other
[1:50:16] people all the other music that they
[1:50:20] play all this other stuff try to be like
[1:50:23] everybody else try to compare and
[1:50:26] conform get our ideas you know how many
[1:50:29] people have come to me and asked me to
[1:50:31] get a drum set cuz some other church has
[1:50:33] got a drum
[1:50:35] set if you want a drum set go
[1:50:42] there I watched a lot of services I
[1:50:45] listen to a lot of tapes and I looked at
[1:50:48] B to the Tabernacle there was no drum
[1:50:54] set I I'm happy to go back to the piano
[1:50:58] and
[1:51:00] organ personally but I like to see young
[1:51:04] people worshiping god with the
[1:51:06] instruments and the strings and
[1:51:08] everything but since when are we trying
[1:51:11] to be like anybody
[1:51:12] else why don't we be above amen and
[1:51:18] Beyond amen Paul said you're fools to
[1:51:21] compare yourselves one with
[1:51:23] another and it goes on all the time what
[1:51:26] are we to compare with the word the word
[1:51:31] the word show it to me in the
[1:51:35] word well let's just talk about
[1:51:37] perfection for a few
[1:51:41] moments I love this messag amen I may
[1:51:45] not always be to live it but I love what
[1:51:47] he said and I believe it's true
[1:51:50] and I believe he's just what he said in
[1:51:52] this this message it's given to the
[1:51:56] Overcomer to
[1:51:59] hear it doesn't need no
[1:52:02] explanation or
[1:52:05] interpretation it speaks for
[1:52:07] itself but let's just
[1:52:11] look look at
[1:52:13] justification we know the seed went into
[1:52:16] the ground right what was the original
[1:52:19] experience at Pentecost went into the
[1:52:23] ground what they really
[1:52:26] possessed what did they come out of the
[1:52:28] room possessing it wasn't possessing
[1:52:32] gifts though they had
[1:52:35] them and I believe in
[1:52:38] them in order and in place they're
[1:52:42] wonderful they're not motivated by
[1:52:48] music they're motivated by prayer and
[1:52:51] fasting and being alone with
[1:52:54] God and being caught up into the spirit
[1:52:58] where the spirit itself maketh
[1:53:00] intercession for you
[1:53:02] amen that's what it's about about
[1:53:05] getting in your closet and getting alone
[1:53:08] with God and God speaking to you and God
[1:53:11] prophesying to you and the spirit making
[1:53:14] intercession and you coming out
[1:53:16] Victorious amen knowing that God spoke
[1:53:20] to
[1:53:21] you you don't wait for that certain
[1:53:26] sounding
[1:53:28] up let's rise up it's a rock
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:36] concert oh but we like
[1:53:38] it I don't care if you like it like it's
[1:53:41] fine I've went and watched the Gaithers
[1:53:44] and just loved
[1:53:45] them I've seen Dy Rambo when she dressed
[1:53:49] right bring tears to my eyes when she's
[1:53:52] saying God walks the dark
[1:53:57] Hills they even make fun about
[1:54:01] it how they used to have their long
[1:54:05] hair it's all it used to be I don't want
[1:54:08] to go
[1:54:10] back hear me this morning I don't want
[1:54:14] to go back I don't want to go back to
[1:54:18] Pentecost that's right that's right I
[1:54:21] want that which is
[1:54:24] perfect
[1:54:26] amen am can you follow with me for a
[1:54:30] moment justification came up right so
[1:54:35] where was the church it was lighting
[1:54:39] candles it was doing penants for
[1:54:43] sins I've seen it with my
[1:54:45] own
[1:54:47] eyes people walking for my miles
[1:54:50] crawling for miles on their
[1:54:53] knees saying a rosary doing
[1:54:58] penants for sins that have already been
[1:55:02] forgiven if you can do one thing for
[1:55:04] your salvation Jesus Christ died in
[1:55:10] vain so the first thing that God had to
[1:55:13] give the
[1:55:14] church was
[1:55:16] justification they're not going to move
[1:55:18] farther
[1:55:20] they're not going to go forward until
[1:55:22] they totally understand they're
[1:55:25] Justified to take the next
[1:55:31] step that you can freely take the next
[1:55:34] step though you're a
[1:55:38] sinner so he brought
[1:55:41] justification and
[1:55:43] justification the Perfection of
[1:55:46] justification justification is not just
[1:55:49] just the fact that he died for
[1:55:52] you that is a historical
[1:55:57] fact it's not just
[1:56:01] knowing or the knowledge of that your
[1:56:04] sins are
[1:56:06] forgiven that's right that's not the
[1:56:11] Perfection of
[1:56:14] justification that's not what was
[1:56:17] perfect in justification wasn't the fact
[1:56:20] that he died for your sins that's true
[1:56:24] it wasn't the fact that your sins were
[1:56:26] forgiven that's true you could know he
[1:56:30] died and know your sins were forgiven
[1:56:33] and still be
[1:56:38] miserable still bearing the
[1:56:43] burden of what you
[1:56:45] did that was not the Perfection of
[1:56:48] justification the Perfection of
[1:56:51] justification was the deliverance from
[1:56:53] the
[1:56:57] guilt that's what made
[1:56:59] justification
[1:57:01] perfect is you didn't have the guilt of
[1:57:03] it
[1:57:05] anymore you weren't carrying it
[1:57:08] anymore it wasn't a part of your
[1:57:10] thinking you've accepted the fact that
[1:57:13] it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:57:16] it can be in the sea of your
[1:57:18] forgetfulness amen
[1:57:22] amen it was the freedom from the
[1:57:31] shame being ashamed because people knew
[1:57:34] what you
[1:57:36] did you think after that woman got done
[1:57:39] washing Jesus's
[1:57:41] feet and he says daughter your sins
[1:57:44] which are many are all forgiven go and
[1:57:48] sin no more
[1:57:50] you think she cared what anybody
[1:57:53] thought she was free from the
[1:57:56] guilt she was free from the
[1:58:00] shame she was
[1:58:05] justified it was as if she never did it
[1:58:09] in the first place that's the
[1:58:12] Perfection of
[1:58:14] justification people believe in
[1:58:17] justification but they've never got that
[1:58:20] which is
[1:58:23] perfect so when justification came they
[1:58:26] could have said when that which is
[1:58:28] perfect is come you'll feel no shame
[1:58:31] you'll feel no guilt and you'll have no
[1:58:34] desire to continue in sin that was a
[1:58:37] just perfection of
[1:58:41] justification it wasn't the knowledge of
[1:58:45] justification it wasn't the work of
[1:58:49] justification it was the
[1:58:52] benefit of what he did on Calvary that
[1:58:55] was the
[1:58:57] Perfection that he could give that to
[1:58:59] the believer now I'm going to say this I
[1:59:01] I've been in this church a lot of times
[1:59:03] there's a lot of people in here who
[1:59:05] believe the message and still have not
[1:59:08] accepted
[1:59:14] justification they're still wallering in
[1:59:16] guilt they're still wallering in shame
[1:59:21] they just can't accept the
[1:59:25] fact that their
[1:59:28] sin is not equivalent to the power of
[1:59:32] his
[1:59:37] blood can't accept
[1:59:41] it they're so
[1:59:43] steep in
[1:59:45] self-pity guilt and
[1:59:48] shame
[1:59:49] that they they can't move to the next
[1:59:54] step from justification the once you
[1:59:57] receive the Perfection of
[2:00:01] justification just like the wheat comes
[2:00:04] up into the the little
[2:00:07] Sprout and the
[2:00:09] stock there's a
[2:00:11] natural next step right that's right
[2:00:14] because the life is
[2:00:16] moving so the natural Next Step we know
[2:00:19] is
[2:00:22] sanctification so so there if there's a
[2:00:25] Perfection to
[2:00:27] justification there's a Perfection to
[2:00:33] sanctification it's the perfect
[2:00:36] work that God performed in
[2:00:41] justification it's the perfect work all
[2:00:43] that he justified he
[2:00:47] sanctifies so there there there are
[2:00:49] Perfection so
[2:00:52] sanctification is is not don't do this
[2:00:55] don't do that can'ts and
[2:00:59] cannots that was
[2:01:01] never what sanctification
[2:01:04] was that was not the Perfection of
[2:01:07] sanctification we're Sanctified we don't
[2:01:10] drink
[2:01:15] coffee throw that machine out
[2:01:18] Matthew
[2:01:19] I'm going to sanctify
[2:01:23] you you you know what I'm saying it
[2:01:26] wasn't oh you got to wear long
[2:01:29] sleeves they were missing the Perfection
[2:01:31] of it it became we do this we do that we
[2:01:35] don't do this we don't do that that was
[2:01:38] never the Perfection of
[2:01:40] sanctification Paul said all things are
[2:01:42] expedient for me all things are lawful
[2:01:45] for me but all things aren't
[2:01:48] expedient
[2:01:49] so what was
[2:01:53] sanctification and the Perfection of San
[2:01:57] sanctification the the S the Perfection
[2:02:01] of
[2:02:03] sanctification is the
[2:02:06] demonstration of what being free from
[2:02:09] sin
[2:02:10] means
[2:02:12] amen how many heard brother BR use the
[2:02:15] word
[2:02:16] reflection this morning over and over
[2:02:18] again
[2:02:19] he said it reflects it's a
[2:02:22] reflection sanctification is a
[2:02:25] reflection that I'm free from this I
[2:02:28] don't have desire to do these things a
[2:02:31] person that's been Justified
[2:02:34] sanctification is the natural thing that
[2:02:37] follows it's the
[2:02:39] result of being free from
[2:02:43] sin but now it becomes an
[2:02:47] awareness that I've I've got to keep
[2:02:49] myself Sanctified CU I'm a written
[2:02:52] epistle read of all
[2:02:55] men I've got to make my testimony
[2:02:59] clear I got to set myself aside for
[2:03:03] service I've got to be washed I've got
[2:03:05] to make sure there's nothing in my life
[2:03:08] I got to avoid the appearance of
[2:03:10] evil that's a
[2:03:13] Perfection of
[2:03:17] sanctification that that's the beauty of
[2:03:20] it it reflects the deliverance from the
[2:03:23] desire of
[2:03:27] sin you can't say I don't desire to
[2:03:29] smoke but I
[2:03:35] smoke right I you
[2:03:39] know uh you know I used to really be in
[2:03:42] love with the Cowboys but I don't love
[2:03:44] them no more I go to their games but I I
[2:03:46] don't love
[2:03:47] them
[2:03:52] well I how how do I know
[2:03:58] that sanctification justification is
[2:04:02] something that's
[2:04:04] unseen that takes place in your
[2:04:07] heart sanctification is the evidence and
[2:04:10] the reflection that something
[2:04:16] has you just get away from it
[2:04:20] how can two walk together unless they
[2:04:23] agree sanctification is the refusal to
[2:04:27] walk with anything that's not perfect
[2:04:30] with the word of
[2:04:34] God that's what sanctification
[2:04:38] isise Lord I don't do that it doesn't
[2:04:42] mean you're not
[2:04:43] kind it doesn't mean you're not
[2:04:46] thoughtful it doesn't mean you don't go
[2:04:48] the extra mile if you are Sanctified you
[2:04:51] do go the extra mile you do give your
[2:04:56] coat those basic Christian principles
[2:04:59] are the basis of justification and
[2:05:02] sanctification if you have those two
[2:05:04] things you do those
[2:05:09] things it that's a Perfection of
[2:05:12] it there's a
[2:05:15] Perfection that's beyond knowledge
[2:05:19] the prophet of God Called It
[2:05:23] life it's a
[2:05:26] life an event takes place in your
[2:05:29] life you come under a
[2:05:32] conviction the spirit convicts you of
[2:05:34] sin you feel guilt and
[2:05:37] shame he
[2:05:39] comes and he reveals to you I've died
[2:05:43] for that I've paid the price for that go
[2:05:46] and sin no
[2:05:47] more you step up
[2:05:50] Justified you don't walk in
[2:05:53] justification that's an inner work you
[2:05:57] walk in
[2:05:58] sanctification because the minute you
[2:06:00] get up there you've separated yourself
[2:06:03] from the world you separated yourself
[2:06:05] from the things of the world the love of
[2:06:08] God which you received when he gave you
[2:06:11] repentance it's not your love it's his
[2:06:14] love it's never been an object of Your
[2:06:17] Love it's not your love of God it's
[2:06:21] God's love of
[2:06:22] you and he expressed that love to you by
[2:06:26] dying on the cross and then sending you
[2:06:30] justification and when you receive that
[2:06:33] and you really repented and you don't
[2:06:35] want to do those things no more you
[2:06:38] desire to be a new person you get up
[2:06:41] from
[2:06:43] there and now you are going to walk in
[2:06:47] sanctification
[2:06:49] amen and what do you do you
[2:06:54] repent and you're baptized in the name
[2:06:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:06:59] receive the gift of the Holy
[2:07:02] Ghost and you start
[2:07:07] walking and then he fills you with his
[2:07:12] Spirit we refer to it as the baptism of
[2:07:15] the Holy Spirit some people refer to is
[2:07:19] be being borned
[2:07:21] again but when you're truly Justified
[2:07:25] you're born again you're a new creature
[2:07:28] in Christ
[2:07:29] Jesus but then he promised you a
[2:07:33] comforter I will not leave you nor
[2:07:35] forsake you but I'll be with you even in
[2:07:38] you to the end and the spirit will come
[2:07:41] and lead you and guide you into all
[2:07:44] truth and
[2:07:45] righteousness he promised you that
[2:07:48] spirit
[2:07:49] that would lead and guide you into all
[2:07:51] righteousness so the per so the baptism
[2:07:54] of the Holy Ghost is not just the res
[2:07:57] restoration of
[2:08:02] gifts it's more than
[2:08:05] that gifts is not the Perfection of the
[2:08:09] baptism of the Holy
[2:08:13] Spirit the Perfection of the baptism of
[2:08:16] the holy spirit is a Godly continence
[2:08:20] and a Godly
[2:08:25] atmosphere the Perfection if I could put
[2:08:28] it this way
[2:08:31] is a and Gifts was given because it it
[2:08:35] lets you know that the spirit is real
[2:08:37] and
[2:08:40] Powerful but that wasn't a Perfection of
[2:08:44] it so Paul comes along and says that'll
[2:08:48] be done away with you'll you're only
[2:08:51] doing that in
[2:08:53] part that's just a
[2:08:57] taste of what God's got
[2:09:01] coming oh he's just saying don't stop
[2:09:04] there keep pressing
[2:09:07] in don't be lured away cuz Satan's
[2:09:11] trying to offer the
[2:09:12] supernatural oh we're
[2:09:16] Supernatural Supernatural
[2:09:23] when you had none
[2:09:25] other than the presence of the son of
[2:09:27] man in our
[2:09:29] generation none other than the Lord
[2:09:32] Jesus Christ himself come down and Veil
[2:09:36] himself in the ministry of the prophet
[2:09:39] and do the same works that he did 2,000
[2:09:42] years ago when he was on Earth healing
[2:09:44] the blind raising the dead casting out
[2:09:48] cancers delivering talking
[2:09:52] to the people behind the his back and
[2:09:56] the tent exactly what he did when he
[2:09:58] appeared to Abraham Discerning them
[2:10:01] exactly what he did when he was talking
[2:10:03] to the woman at the
[2:10:09] well I don't want
[2:10:12] to
[2:10:14] exchange why God did
[2:10:16] that and the
[2:10:19] Perfection that was to follow that
[2:10:23] demonstration of the son of
[2:10:26] man for what
[2:10:29] the prophet called a bowl of
[2:10:38] pottage and I know the
[2:10:41] argument well we can do
[2:10:46] both we can have this in that too you
[2:10:50] want to know how many quotes I can get
[2:10:52] you where the prophet of God talks about
[2:10:54] he said one
[2:10:56] word one
[2:10:58] word I can cut my hair and still speak
[2:11:01] and T one
[2:11:04] word that's why the rain falls on the
[2:11:07] what the just and the unjust that's why
[2:11:10] many will come to me in that day and say
[2:11:12] Lord Lord didn't I know you I'm not
[2:11:15] angry
[2:11:16] Church okay
[2:11:19] but when I see
[2:11:21] spirits trying to take the children of
[2:11:23] the Living God the seed word children of
[2:11:27] this message and trying to feed them
[2:11:31] something other when the than what the
[2:11:33] messenger of the hour taught it stirs me
[2:11:40] up and it's fine if you leave it out
[2:11:43] there but when you bring it in
[2:11:47] here and start accusing
[2:11:50] me of not believing in the move of the
[2:11:53] spirit you start saying that this
[2:11:55] congregation doesn't in believe that you
[2:11:58] might get some discernment that they
[2:11:59] really don't
[2:12:03] want God's word don't need
[2:12:05] interpretation he stands on it
[2:12:10] himself it's totally
[2:12:17] exposed but you know why they don't hear
[2:12:19] it they don't listen to
[2:12:30] it it's
[2:12:33] great I've been to concerts where I tell
[2:12:36] you I could have I could have jumped out
[2:12:39] of the top balcony and flown down to the
[2:12:43] stage you ever been to any of those M
[2:12:46] where it's just it's so in spiring man
[2:12:49] you're just you're you're shaken
[2:12:53] yes I've been to sporting events where
[2:12:56] I've chewed my fingers off to my
[2:13:03] Knuckles just in anticipation what's
[2:13:06] going to
[2:13:11] happen I never could figure out why
[2:13:13] people like scary
[2:13:15] movies and go watch something that's
[2:13:17] scary them to death and I thought
[2:13:20] they're
[2:13:21] actors nobody's getting
[2:13:23] killed there's no
[2:13:26] ghosts there's no secret people sitting
[2:13:29] behind
[2:13:30] closets it's all in your
[2:13:33] head well isn't that where the battle is
[2:13:36] anywhere why can't we move it out of our
[2:13:38] head into
[2:13:43] reality so let's go
[2:13:45] on will you bear with me
[2:13:48] I like how brother Ram says I'm going to
[2:13:50] say something that hurts will you still
[2:13:51] love
[2:13:52] me raise your hand everybody and let me
[2:13:55] know you're going to still love me you
[2:13:57] know what I mean I tell you ho ho ho ho
[2:14:00] but you know what he was telling them
[2:14:03] charity amen yes hope faith and charity
[2:14:06] but but all these is love are you going
[2:14:09] to still love me amen so list what he
[2:14:12] said what is the
[2:14:16] Perfection of
[2:14:18] the Holy
[2:14:20] Spirit what was the promise I will not
[2:14:23] leave you nor forsake you but I will
[2:14:28] come again and be with you even in you
[2:14:33] that was the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:36] that's
[2:14:38] right when they came out of the upper
[2:14:41] room they were just fulfilling a
[2:14:44] prophecy of
[2:14:46] Joel that told him when this came this
[2:14:50] would
[2:14:53] happen but they did that wasn't the
[2:14:56] Perfection of it the Perfection was now
[2:14:59] they had the spirit of
[2:15:02] Truth the presence of the Lord Jesus the
[2:15:05] indwelling spirit that was going to lead
[2:15:08] them and guide them in all righteousness
[2:15:11] guide them lead them the footsteps of
[2:15:14] the righteous are ordered by the Lord
[2:15:17] and that that Spirit would convict them
[2:15:19] of
[2:15:21] sin so when they started unbelieving the
[2:15:25] word of God they'd be
[2:15:27] convicted we've got communion tonight
[2:15:29] that'll be a short
[2:15:31] service so the the Perfection is is the
[2:15:34] ever presence of the indwelling spirit
[2:15:39] not on
[2:15:40] you but in
[2:15:44] you it can fall on anybody
[2:15:48] it can only be in the
[2:15:53] elect he said I always I'll never leave
[2:15:56] you nor forsake you the the the
[2:15:59] Perfection of the spirit is a conscious
[2:16:03] reality of his
[2:16:07] presence now
[2:16:10] don't stop
[2:16:15] there cuz let's read go back in closing
[2:16:19] here and I'm I'm just going to leave
[2:16:22] this a little
[2:16:24] short of of everything that could be
[2:16:30] said in the 12th verse he
[2:16:36] says and we're talking about this
[2:16:40] Perfection but
[2:16:43] when that which is perfect is
[2:16:46] come and my question question is what is
[2:16:50] that which is
[2:16:52] perfect now I know most people say the
[2:16:59] Bible now if you were maybe raised in
[2:17:01] the fundamental
[2:17:05] Evangelical place they feel what when
[2:17:08] the King James Bible was printed the
[2:17:10] word was assembled by God that's which
[2:17:13] is
[2:17:15] perfect true the word of God is
[2:17:20] perfect but the letter
[2:17:23] kth and the spirit gives it
[2:17:27] life so we know that there's something
[2:17:30] that is perfect that is to come now this
[2:17:34] is Paul goes on to make this statement
[2:17:37] and I hope I can tie this together and
[2:17:38] you'll be bear with
[2:17:40] me he says for now we see through a
[2:17:44] glass
[2:17:45] darkling but then face to to
[2:17:49] face in other words face to face means
[2:17:53] person to person in fact that's even how
[2:17:56] the gospel really was to be spread not
[2:17:59] through radio not through television but
[2:18:02] face to face from Revelation to
[2:18:04] Revelation somebody getting saved Born
[2:18:07] Again delivered the love of God moving
[2:18:10] in their heart going to their friend go
[2:18:12] just like Phillip and
[2:18:16] Nathaniel and mve in you to
[2:18:19] move not just bringing them to church
[2:18:21] and letting the church do it the
[2:18:23] preacher do it but you do
[2:18:27] it saying friend the way you're living
[2:18:30] you're going to go to
[2:18:34] hell sister might say sister you can't
[2:18:36] you can't be doing
[2:18:39] that a real genuine Love in Your Heart
[2:18:44] charity amen greater than all things the
[2:18:48] Capstone what happened to the Capstone
[2:18:50] the
[2:18:52] Capstone so he says he says now this is
[2:18:58] the
[2:19:00] beginning of
[2:19:02] what is the
[2:19:05] Perfection that we're going to come to
[2:19:08] so I want to make it unequivocally
[2:19:11] plain the
[2:19:13] gifts the prophecy the emotion the
[2:19:17] dancing in the spirit everything that
[2:19:20] brother brandom distinctively
[2:19:24] covered in that is not the
[2:19:31] Perfection we can do those things if God
[2:19:34] so
[2:19:37] permits but let's
[2:19:40] not take
[2:19:44] that in a substitute right for the
[2:19:48] Perfection that he's offering
[2:19:53] us so let's just close in these
[2:19:58] thoughts he says but then face to face
[2:20:03] now I know in
[2:20:07] part so he says all these things I just
[2:20:10] have a glimpse of I have
[2:20:13] Parts
[2:20:16] pieces right right we read the Bible and
[2:20:18] they came up with this piece that piece
[2:20:21] different people would take different
[2:20:23] people pieces and put them together and
[2:20:25] make different
[2:20:28] pies Baptist pie Presbyterian pie pie
[2:20:33] pie
[2:20:34] pieces the prophet God said they were
[2:20:36] all
[2:20:38] glimpsing at the truth they were getting
[2:20:41] glimpses of it they were getting pieces
[2:20:43] of it and they would take the pieces
[2:20:46] that they had have and they would put
[2:20:48] him together and they were doing God a
[2:20:51] service without it being his
[2:20:55] will now he's not preaching these
[2:20:57] messages to the
[2:20:59] church he's preaching the message to the
[2:21:02] church because he wants them to know
[2:21:04] there's a Perfection lying
[2:21:08] ahead and he doesn't want them to
[2:21:12] stop along the journey and set up camp
[2:21:21] am I
[2:21:23] clear all quiet in here have I have any
[2:21:27] friends
[2:21:31] left I could have them put the baskets
[2:21:33] out there and you could take your tis
[2:21:35] and offerings back as you go out the
[2:21:39] door he doesn't want them to
[2:21:42] stop he doesn't he wants you to know
[2:21:45] there's going to be many that come and
[2:21:47] and say Lo he is here and lo he is
[2:21:50] there we don't want to stop so let's
[2:21:54] let's just go he says here he says he
[2:21:57] says I know in part but what happened
[2:22:00] all these pieces were up there and then
[2:22:03] the mighty angel
[2:22:05] came he put his foot on the land and the
[2:22:08] Sea and he had a
[2:22:11] book is that
[2:22:13] right and our names were written in that
[2:22:16] book that's right cuz it was the Lamb's
[2:22:19] Book of
[2:22:21] Life right and that book was sealed
[2:22:25] with Seven
[2:22:28] Seals right and we know it it it was on
[2:22:33] the book and without going into the
[2:22:36] seals but we know that there was
[2:22:39] four satanic horse riters that went out
[2:22:44] and tried to seal these Mysteries away
[2:22:47] away from the
[2:22:49] church and there were four
[2:22:53] beasts that God
[2:22:55] sent to keep it
[2:22:59] alive then at the
[2:23:05] end the mighty Angel
[2:23:08] Hallelujah John saw him coming down and
[2:23:12] he was taking the book and John was
[2:23:14] going to
[2:23:16] write
[2:23:17] and he he told them don't
[2:23:21] write but as it is in the days of the
[2:23:23] voice of the seventh angel then these
[2:23:27] things would be opened up and the
[2:23:30] Mysteries would be named on that's right
[2:23:35] so now it's not going to be in part but
[2:23:39] the first
[2:23:41] evidence of what the Perfection is that
[2:23:45] God is to give is for you to be known as
[2:23:49] you were
[2:23:53] known you understand that let me let me
[2:23:57] just read a statement to so I can just
[2:24:03] uh it's paragraph 60 I
[2:24:07] believe in invisible
[2:24:14] union now as you were know
[2:24:18] this is the first
[2:24:22] step and
[2:24:24] then I know in part but then I will know
[2:24:28] as I was
[2:24:31] known when did he know me how do he know
[2:24:35] me where was I at where were you when
[2:24:39] the the the angels in the Earth where
[2:24:42] were you when the the sons of God
[2:24:45] shouted for joy where were you you know
[2:24:47] what I can say I was
[2:24:55] there now you're going to know as you
[2:24:58] were
[2:25:00] known and so were
[2:25:06] you I'll just read the paragraph before
[2:25:09] any son will put daughter also is an
[2:25:12] attribute of his father and just as you
[2:25:16] were in the genes of your father in the
[2:25:19] body of your father when he was a young
[2:25:22] boy you were in him he could not have
[2:25:26] fellowship with you because he didn't
[2:25:29] know you but then through the bedding
[2:25:31] ground of mother you were brought forth
[2:25:33] into the Earth and became in the image
[2:25:36] of your father then he could have
[2:25:38] fellowship with
[2:25:41] you now he's telling you how you were
[2:25:45] known so so were you sons of and
[2:25:49] Daughters of God before there even was a
[2:25:52] moon a star or a
[2:25:57] molecule you were Sons and Daughters of
[2:26:01] God for you are only the physical
[2:26:05] manifestation of the attribute that was
[2:26:08] in God at the
[2:26:10] beginning oh
[2:26:12] Hallelujah now I'm being known as I was
[2:26:15] known
[2:26:17] this is how God knew me this is when God
[2:26:20] knew me this is where I was before the
[2:26:23] foundation of the world I I've known all
[2:26:26] this other in part but when that which
[2:26:28] is perfect has
[2:26:32] come all the pieces will be done away
[2:26:35] with and I will know even as I'm
[2:26:39] known oh Lord you mean you knew me where
[2:26:41] back
[2:26:44] then you allowed me to go through all
[2:26:46] this
[2:26:48] sin I needed you to display my
[2:26:51] attributes I needed you to show I was a
[2:26:54] forgiver I needed you to show I was a
[2:26:57] deliverer I needed you to show all these
[2:26:59] things there was a whole side of me
[2:27:01] nobody had ever known but I've let you
[2:27:03] come down so you could be my attributes
[2:27:06] you could be the Deliverance you could
[2:27:08] be the healing you could be the
[2:27:11] Salvation oh praise
[2:27:15] God
[2:27:18] listen the manifestation of the
[2:27:20] attribute that God was at the beginning
[2:27:23] for there is only one form of eternal
[2:27:27] life and that was
[2:27:32] you
[2:27:35] glory you want to substitute that for a
[2:27:38] little
[2:27:40] dance rise

[2:27:45] up walk in the the power of Life walk in
[2:27:49] the spirit walk in the
[2:28:01] wordu Hallelujah that was

[2:28:11] known that was me that was me that was
[2:28:16] me
[2:28:20] always had eternal
[2:28:23] life why do I want a little piece of pie
[2:28:27] when God's giv me the whole
[2:28:30] [Music]
[2:28:42] Bakery how could this Prophet write
[2:28:44] these things where was he living
[2:28:49] am that's somebody that walked so close
[2:28:52] with God he could be mistaken for
[2:28:57] God remember he said they were a lot
[2:28:59] closer than most everybody
[2:29:04] else
[2:29:07] Len from of eternal life and that was
[2:29:10] you
[2:29:11] before you don't know nothing about
[2:29:15] it
[2:29:18] neither did you know when you was in
[2:29:22] your Earthly
[2:29:27] father you didn't

[2:30:00] image Hallelujah now we're talking about
[2:30:04] the Perfection that's
[2:30:06] right not a move of the spirit but now
[2:30:10] we're talking about being conformed in
[2:30:13] to his image
[2:30:19] in the image of God you are made and you
[2:30:23] were manifested for the glory and The
[2:30:26] Fellowship Of
[2:30:29] God I could just go into book that book
[2:30:32] right
[2:30:33] now the
[2:30:40] Perfection is the
[2:30:43] union of husband and wife
[2:30:48] hallelu that these two shall be
[2:30:58] one so what Satan
[2:31:00] do he doesn't want that

[2:31:08] Unity so he's going to offer you
[2:31:11] Supernatural okay you want to settle the

[2:34:59] taking place and I'm
[2:35:04] obligated and that's what he said when
[2:35:06] you start staying with the word that's
[2:35:09] when you're not very
[2:35:11] [Music]
