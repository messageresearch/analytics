[14:38] that one day you saw us
[14:40] deep in the miry clay and you lifted us
[14:43] lord god and you planted our feet
[14:46] upon a solid rock lord god
[14:49] that you turned our hearts and our minds
[14:51] towards this message lord god

[41:52] the book of romans
[41:55] chapter three
[41:57] chapter eight
[42:00] new zealand
[42:09] romans
[42:11] chapter eight and verse eight uh
[42:32] romans chapter 8 verse 8 to 14
[42:36] so then they that are in the flesh
[42:38] cannot please god
[42:41] but ye are not in the flesh
[42:43] but in the spirit if so be that the
[42:46] spirit of god dwelleth in you
[42:49] now if any man have the spirit of christ
[42:53] he is
[42:54] if any man have if any man have not the
[42:57] spirit of christ he is none of his
[43:00] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[43:04] because of sin
[43:05] but the spirit
[43:07] but the spirit is life because of
[43:10] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[43:13] that raise it that raise it up christ
[43:16] jesus from the dead dwells in you
[43:19] it will he that raiseth christ from the
[43:21] dead
[43:23] shall also quicken your mortal body
[43:26] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[43:29] therefore brethren we are
[43:31] we are debtors not to the flesh but live
[43:34] after the or to live after the flesh
[43:37] for he
[43:39] for if we live after the flesh ye shall
[43:41] die but if ye leave
[43:45] but if ye through the spirit do
[43:47] mortified the deed of the body ye shall
[43:50] live
[43:52] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[43:55] god they are the the sons of god
[44:03] let's go back to the book of acts
[44:06] chapter two
[44:14] it's a very familiar scripture reading
[44:25] acts chapter 2
[44:27] 37-39
[44:30] um
[44:32] now when they hit when when they're
[44:34] heard this they were pricked in their
[44:38] heart
[44:39] and said unto peter
[44:41] and to the rest of the apostle men and
[44:43] brethren what shall we do
[44:47] then peter said unto them
[44:49] repent and be baptized every one of you
[44:52] in the name of jesus christ
[44:55] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[44:59] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[45:01] for the promise is unto you
[45:04] and to your children and

[47:31] the promise of the holy ghost
[47:33] i don't know
[47:38] bringing it out of acts chapter 2
[47:40] verse 39.
[47:45] this morning it was a great blessing
[47:48] [Music]
[47:50] that
[47:52] to have the key to access the
[47:53] supernatural but could you know that
[47:56] play
[47:57] have you done this
[47:59] god has called us to live in the
[48:01] supernatural
[48:04] view
[48:06] god wants that every day of our lives
[48:08] that we may be in the supernatural
[48:11] remember for the shows
[48:14] and sometimes things that seems easy for
[48:16] us
[48:18] we know that god is behind it
[48:22] that the supernatural is behind it
[48:28] and and for those that have access so
[48:30] that knows a little bit about science
[48:38] regardless of all the noises that the
[48:40] scientific world makes two circuits of
[48:43] fair all that they know to do said
[48:45] explique como
[48:48] is to explain how the thing is working
[48:52] capable but they are all incapable
[48:59] to say who is causing that thing to work
[49:02] the way it's working
[49:07] they will tell you that the earth is
[49:08] turning around the sun
[49:11] it's going to take 24 hours it's going
[49:14] to take 365 days
[49:20] but who tells the earth to go around the
[49:22] sun the way it goes
[49:24] they are incapable of telling you that
[49:27] even with you upon the level
[49:30] they will tell you that in the winter
[49:32] time that life in the tree will go down
[49:34] to the roots
[49:37] and then during the the the springtime
[49:39] it will start to come back like you
[49:41] don't learn delicious i'll accept the
[49:42] disorder but who gives the intelligence
[49:45] to life in the tree to go into the roots
[49:51] so even what we see in the natural yeah
[49:54] there is a supernatural that's causing
[49:56] it
[49:58] god is in everything
[50:03] that's why god is wanting us to be in
[50:05] that supernatural
[50:08] it was wonderful this morning
[50:12] and tonight i'm just going to try to
[50:14] just uh uh uh uh to bring a little more
[50:18] on a long video
[50:20] to going for uh forward with the promise
[50:22] of the holy ghost
[50:27] because we know it's god in the
[50:28] beginning who created all things
[50:35] it's god who used the form of the word
[50:37] in order to create all things
[50:41] manifested
[50:43] in the old testimony he came and he was
[50:46] manifested as god above us
[50:50] it was god the father he let that
[51:05] you would have to be careful otherwise
[51:07] you were going to die
[51:11] but this guard who was above us
[51:15] he found out that on the form that he
[51:17] was in
[51:20] a
[51:24] he
[51:25] he couldn't bring us into the stature or
[51:28] in the nature that we should have had
[51:30] but a lot of other people because man
[51:33] had lost his possession
[51:38] the position that god placed him when he
[51:40] placed him in the garden of eden
[51:45] that's why that same god he changed the
[51:48] form
[51:51] it was a god who was uh uh severe in his
[51:55] judgment
[51:58] he became emmanuel god with us
[52:03] we were able to touch him he knew that
[52:06] protester he brought us his grace la
[52:09] bibica don't set the form
[52:11] in the bible it says that in this form
[52:16] he wanted to reconcile the world to god
[52:23] he came as the uh uh the
[52:26] uh link between to bring together man
[52:29] and god mesut
[52:37] he didn't accomplish all that he wanted
[52:39] for us
[52:43] he didn't accomplish the the the final
[52:46] product that god wanted for us
[52:50] that's why in the end of his mission
[52:55] when we look in john chapter 14
[53:16] chapter 14 verse 14 it says if ye ask
[53:19] anything in my name i will do it
[53:25] if you love me keep my commandment
[53:29] and i will pray
[53:34] and he shall give you another comforter
[53:40] that he may abide with you forever
[53:46] you those that are in in a trinity it is
[53:49] the voila women
[53:50] it says now look this is he himself yes
[53:54] jesus
[53:57] that he's going to pray to the father
[54:01] so that the father may send the holy
[54:04] ghost
[54:06] that means there's three people
[54:22] and jesus
[54:36] neither know him no
[54:38] neither knoweth him
[54:42] know him
[54:45] for he dwells with you
[54:49] and shall be in you
[54:52] and now hear what they say
[54:56] i will not leave you comfortless
[55:01] i will come to you
[55:05] so it's no longer the spirit that the
[55:07] father will send
[55:09] but he himself is saying
[55:12] i will not leave you comfortless
[55:16] i will come to you
[55:32] also
[55:36] then jesus is making the promise
[55:42] the same way that god changed the form
[55:46] of pain he left his position of
[55:48] fatherhood
[55:50] so he could become the son of god the
[55:52] problem of the problem with people
[55:57] conception of the jews they don't have
[55:59] the conception of god
[56:02] and as we heard it this morning
[56:05] it's not by our intellect
[56:08] but it's by revelation
[56:12] that's why jesus could say
[56:35] it's like us as men as human having a
[56:38] child a local let's show that
[56:41] definition
[56:43] in fact the things of god they have
[56:45] their own definition in the word of god
[56:48] the bible says in isaiah
[56:51] that god will give you a sign what's the
[56:54] university
[56:55] yeah uh
[56:57] virgin shall conceived
[57:01] will have a son
[57:05] and it shall be his name shall be
[57:06] emmanuel
[57:10] which means god with us
[57:14] that was the word of god the fifth of
[57:16] jesus
[57:17] the son of god means
[57:20] god with us
[57:22] god inaudible
[57:26] the same god who changed the form yeah
[57:29] who became the son of god but not that
[57:31] he formed the future but in a form of
[57:34] the son of god
[57:38] and he himself said that he couldn't
[57:40] help us in remaining in that form
[57:44] that he had to go
[57:47] from this sentence that he may come back
[57:49] in the form of the holy ghost
[57:51] so they can dwell in us
[57:55] and to lead us in all things
[58:00] when we look at the ephesians chapter
[58:02] one
[58:05] the bible says
[58:20] uh
[58:35] even even even as you are called
[58:38] in one hope
[58:41] of your calling in your ancestor
[58:44] one lord
[58:45] insult for one faith and soul but one
[58:49] baptism
[58:51] six
[58:52] as a jew one god
[58:55] and father of all
[58:57] ki
[58:59] who is above all
[59:02] we can say god the father
[59:05] and through all
[59:07] jealousy god the son emmanuel
[59:12] and inaudible
[59:14] the holy ghost the son of jesus one god
[59:18] ki
[59:19] who's the father
[59:21] who's above all
[59:24] who had the form of god the father above
[59:27] us
[59:29] who's among us through us
[59:32] god emmanuel
[59:35] the son of god
[59:38] and in all the holy ghost
[59:41] and when god promised this is
[59:50] when he resurrected he said to the
[59:52] disciples
[59:55] go and wait in jerusalem
[59:58] you will
[1:00:09] when this promise came to pass
[1:00:12] piers
[1:00:24] he knew that in the book of joel god
[1:00:26] promised something
[1:00:30] when people thought that they were
[1:00:31] drunken
[1:00:33] he says they are not drunk as he
[1:00:35] supports that
[1:00:37] this is the promise
[1:00:40] that god promised in the book of jokes
[1:00:44] that in the last day
[1:00:47] i will pour out my spirit upon our flesh
[1:00:51] your young men will have visions
[1:01:09] they talk to peter and other disciples
[1:01:12] oh brothers what shall we do
[1:01:16] and that's when peter said
[1:01:18] repent because
[1:01:22] that every one of you may be baptized in
[1:01:24] the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:26] for the for the forgiveness of your sins
[1:01:30] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:01:32] holy ghost
[1:01:34] he said this promise is for you
[1:01:36] circulated those that were in front of
[1:01:39] him
[1:01:40] and for your children
[1:01:44] and for all those that are far off
[1:01:49] and as many as our lord our lord god
[1:01:51] shall call then like
[1:01:54] that's how we're coming to that promise
[1:01:58] it's a promise that was made unto us
[1:02:01] yeah it defects second it was made to
[1:02:03] each and every one of us a certain
[1:02:05] promise and this promise but the condos
[1:02:08] have only because when we read roman
[1:02:10] jesus romans chapter 10
[1:02:14] that if we don't have the spirit of god
[1:02:17] we are not of god
[1:02:20] that all of those that have the spirit
[1:02:23] of god
[1:02:24] they are called the sons of god
[1:02:29] so for us to really be the children of
[1:02:31] god
[1:02:34] in order for us to have access to the
[1:02:36] supernatural
[1:02:39] exhaustion and for us to know that god
[1:02:41] is hearing our prayers
[1:02:44] we have to access to this
[1:02:58] that's when we have the supernatural in
[1:02:59] our lives
[1:03:03] that's when we are sure that god is
[1:03:05] hearing our prayers
[1:03:10] that the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:14] the holy
[1:03:43] countdown
[1:03:45] paragraph 37
[1:03:56] if a man
[1:03:57] sets if a man sets on the thought that
[1:04:01] of justification is all that we have to
[1:04:03] have don't leave her is wrong don't
[1:04:06] leave her
[1:04:07] wrong
[1:04:08] he's got to be wrong hello
[1:04:15] and then if your church who believes
[1:04:18] like the many of the pentecostals
[1:04:20] please say sir the holy ghost is it
[1:04:26] that's all just repent and get the holy
[1:04:29] ghost that's your fault that's still
[1:04:31] wrong
[1:04:38] about
[1:04:40] because you've got to get sanctification
[1:04:43] in there to cleanse it before the holy
[1:04:46] ghost can come in synovial just create a
[1:04:48] song
[1:04:50] if you don't you leave out the blood
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:05:00] as people talk to the baptist talk that
[1:05:03] the baptism of the holy ghost is the new
[1:05:05] birth
[1:05:06] now that's wrong the bottom of the
[1:05:08] sentence please the baptism of the holy
[1:05:11] ghost
[1:05:13] is different from the new birth
[1:05:18] the new birth is when you are born again
[1:05:22] but the holy ghost
[1:05:28] is when the power comes into that birth
[1:05:31] for service set exactly that's it that's
[1:05:34] that's exactly yellow sentence see the
[1:05:36] holy ghost said but he said the sentence
[1:05:39] is baptized in the holy ghost
[1:05:42] for the new birth
[1:05:47] you have the new birth in believing in
[1:05:49] the lord jesus
[1:05:55] by having faith in accepting him as your
[1:05:58] savior
[1:06:00] that's birthday
[1:06:10] now if you want to back that up see uh
[1:06:13] take sent john uh five and twenty four
[1:06:27] he's got the life because he believes mr
[1:06:30] mummy
[1:06:35] and that same group had to go to
[1:06:37] pentecost to be baptized with the holy
[1:06:39] ghost
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:52] so when people talk about you got to be
[1:06:54] born again
[1:06:57] and applying that to the holy ghost
[1:07:03] many of the metadata and so forth are
[1:07:06] wrong there
[1:07:08] it cannot
[1:07:11] be
[1:07:12] a just won't cope through the scripture
[1:07:14] here
[1:07:17] you get the things
[1:07:18] sideways
[1:07:22] it's got to be
[1:07:24] it's got to take it the way the
[1:07:26] scriptures got to it's got it placed out
[1:07:29] here see
[1:07:32] the holy ghost is ah
[1:07:37] you shall receive the new birth after
[1:07:40] this what
[1:07:53] after this holy ghost has come upon you
[1:07:59] see and they and they had already
[1:08:02] believed to eternal life
[1:08:05] and so forth
[1:08:08] sentence
[1:08:10] but they had to have the holy ghost for
[1:08:13] power
[1:08:18] you shall be
[1:08:19] witnesses unto me
[1:08:21] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:08:24] basically
[1:08:28] because the holy ghost is the witness of
[1:08:31] the resurrection
[1:08:36] showing that you have become an adult in
[1:08:39] christ
[1:08:41] so this promise is very important to us
[1:08:44] that diplomatic sentence
[1:08:47] this promise of holy of the holy spirit
[1:08:49] is important to us
[1:08:54] the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:08:56] something of great importance in our
[1:08:59] walk every day
[1:09:02] because this baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:19] it means we don't have that god coming
[1:09:21] and dwelling in us
[1:09:25] it means we're walking by ourselves
[1:09:29] we are certainly on the road
[1:09:32] we
[1:09:48] so he can lead us in all the things that
[1:09:50] we are doing
[1:09:53] because he said when the holy ghost
[1:09:55] shall come
[1:09:58] he will guide us in all truth and
[1:10:00] righteousness
[1:10:04] it will show us things to come
[1:10:11] that's why this promise is important
[1:10:30] the reason is we see god here send the
[1:10:33] holy ghost the absolute is for one
[1:10:36] purpose god genuinely that god himself
[1:10:39] which i believe don't say that he may
[1:10:42] dwell in his church
[1:10:46] and continue his works through the
[1:10:49] church
[1:10:51] what god was in christ
[1:10:56] he was following the same work through
[1:10:58] christ
[1:11:02] and from christ he came into the church
[1:11:04] he'll possess enough a traveling to
[1:11:07] continue the same work in the church and
[1:11:10] the placenta is a journey so the holy
[1:11:13] spirit is god himself
[1:11:16] who comes to establish
[1:11:18] himself in us
[1:11:20] to continue his works
[1:11:23] to keep to to put us on the on the worst
[1:11:26] concept to put us into service
[1:11:31] to introduce us into the supernatural
[1:11:34] conjunction
[1:11:35] because when god who's supernatural
[1:11:52] says
[1:11:54] and why was the holy spirit given
[1:11:59] paragraph 94
[1:12:02] it says that's the purpose of the holy
[1:12:05] ghost
[1:12:08] that's what god sent the holy ghost for
[1:12:11] the sentence
[1:12:14] the holy ghost came to give us to give
[1:12:17] you power
[1:12:20] i got some scriptures here
[1:12:23] just a minute
[1:12:27] the holy ghost came can't come to give
[1:12:30] us power to give you power
[1:12:48] give you
[1:13:00] intellectually we can read the word
[1:13:14] who is explaining how things work my
[1:13:30] and this promise is for it's for it's
[1:13:32] for each and every one of us
[1:13:36] no one is excluded from this promise
[1:13:41] don't appear you take
[1:13:43] you that to give you power in prayer
[1:13:46] in person
[1:13:48] it says you take a person that's live a
[1:13:50] good life
[1:13:53] but but but they are always defeated
[1:13:57] oh i tell you i'm
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:11] they never get a prayer answered
[1:14:15] uniform
[1:14:18] you filled that little woman with the
[1:14:20] holy ghost one time
[1:14:23] watch it says watch what take what takes
[1:14:26] place can't tell what they want you when
[1:14:28] she goes before god and above she is not
[1:14:32] defeated
[1:14:36] she comes boldly to the throne of god
[1:14:39] believing
[1:15:06] see he's got the holy ghost
[1:15:10] it gives you power
[1:15:14] your life is full of power it will
[1:15:17] dandela
[1:15:19] it gives you power in speech it is a
[1:15:28] paragraph 10103 i was talking of power
[1:15:32] of power of prayer
[1:15:35] i was talking on power of prayer the
[1:15:37] power of speech
[1:15:40] and power of holy life amen amen voila
[1:15:47] that's what the holy ghost is to do the
[1:15:49] sentence you
[1:16:04] this word that's the key to the
[1:16:06] supernatural parallel
[1:16:09] it's the word that's bringing us into
[1:16:11] the supernatural sentence
[1:16:14] the holy ghost gives us power in the
[1:16:17] word
[1:16:24] and the power of holy life
[1:16:28] what the enemy tries to do
[1:16:32] is to make us weak in prayer you know
[1:16:35] doctors tell him
[1:16:36] he he keeps us occupied so much during
[1:16:39] the day
[1:16:41] and sometimes we come back very tired
[1:16:46] and when we take account of all the day
[1:16:50] we haven't even prayed for 10 minutes
[1:16:52] in 24 hours
[1:16:55] but the holy ghost
[1:16:57] god gives us the holy ghost
[1:17:14] the holy ghost will bring us into prayer
[1:17:18] the holy ghost will bring us into the
[1:17:20] presence of god
[1:17:23] because it's in the presence of god
[1:17:29] we can have access to all the blessings
[1:17:31] that god has promised in his word
[1:17:34] and that's the role of the holy ghost
[1:17:38] and that's the promise that god has made
[1:17:40] us
[1:17:44] peter said this promise unto you
[1:17:47] for your children
[1:17:50] for those that are far off honesty
[1:17:55] and as many as our lord our god shall
[1:17:57] come
[1:17:59] and that's why it's important to each
[1:18:01] and every one of us
[1:18:05] to realize the importance of the holy
[1:18:07] ghost in our lives
[1:18:10] it means when you don't have the holy
[1:18:12] ghost
[1:18:13] you'll say oh but when i'm shameless i
[1:18:15] love the lord
[1:18:17] i want to leave the world
[1:18:20] but i'm always defeated
[1:18:24] but when the holy ghost is in you
[1:18:28] when god himself comes to establish
[1:18:30] himself in you
[1:18:32] you will live from victory unto victory
[1:18:36] let's all stand
[1:18:38] per second this promise is in for all of
[1:18:41] us
[1:18:43] the holy ghost is ours
[1:18:46] and god promised us the holy ghost
[1:18:50] to give us the power
[1:18:52] in the word
[1:19:11] so that we may not live by the flesh as
[1:19:14] paul is speaking uh spoken in the book
[1:19:16] of romans
[1:19:18] but we may live powerless by the holy
[1:19:20] ghost
[1:19:22] by god himself
[1:19:25] he comes to establish himself in us
[1:19:28] to continue his work
[1:19:32] it's very important that we claim that
[1:19:34] promise
[1:19:36] that every one of us
[1:19:38] is every sentence when we are baptized
[1:19:40] with the holy ghost
[1:19:43] we are sure
[1:19:45] we are on the road
[1:19:48] and
[1:19:48] says
[1:19:58] he's going to go he's going to come to
[1:19:59] rapture only those that have the holy
[1:20:01] ghost
[1:20:05] and we know that we're all trying our
[1:20:07] best to be there on that day
[1:20:10] but tonight so that you don't miss that
[1:20:12] day you don't listen
[1:20:16] the holy ghost is something of great
[1:20:18] meaning for us
[1:20:21] it introduces into the supernatural
[1:20:24] let's pray
[1:20:29] god had a beloved father
[1:20:37] we know the
[1:20:38] importance of the holy ghost
[1:20:42] we know that it's you coming to dwell in
[1:20:45] us
[1:20:47] that's why we claim it for each and
[1:20:49] every one of us
[1:20:53] we claim it for each brother and its
[1:20:55] sister
[1:20:56] we claim it for each and every child oh
[1:20:59] come true
[1:21:00] as you promised lord controversy
[1:21:03] when you said in the book of job
[1:21:06] you did it in on the day of penalties
[1:21:10] you said that that promise was ours
[1:21:12] jesus
[1:21:15] i pray that each and every one of their
[1:21:17] children that will come closer to you
[1:21:20] those that have repented with all their
[1:21:22] hearts

[1:22:28] in the name of the lord jesus
[1:22:31] amen amen
[1:22:49] aren't you glad there's the gift of the
[1:22:50] holy ghost
[1:22:52] you know i think i was thinking of just
[1:22:55] going through my mind of the different
[1:22:58] brothers in the church and
[1:23:00] and i i watched as they accepted the
[1:23:03] lord and they believed
[1:23:05] in the lord you know what i mean and
[1:23:06] they knew this message was right and
[1:23:09] they just
[1:23:10] and yet they they were dealing with
[1:23:12] cigarettes or they were dealing with
[1:23:14] uh
[1:23:15] alcohol you know what i mean and they
[1:23:18] just they just sat there i talked to one
[1:23:20] brother one time you could tell i love
[1:23:23] the lord you know pack of cigarettes in
[1:23:25] his pocket and a whole truck bed full of
[1:23:28] beer cans and everything one day
[1:23:32] he got the holy ghost
[1:23:34] amen he got the supernatural
[1:23:37] that made the difference and answered
[1:23:40] the cry of your heart
[1:23:42] so
[1:23:43] never give up
[1:23:45] because there's something that god has
[1:23:47] that
[1:23:48] for you amen if you have your bibles as
[1:23:50] the brothers who go prepare for
[1:23:53] communion
[1:23:54] let's turn over into the book of mark
[1:23:57] in the 14th chapter
[1:24:00] and we'll start reading so i just think
[1:24:02] that's
[1:24:03] you know the spirit of god that gift
[1:24:07] is
[1:24:08] the difference in what we can do and
[1:24:10] what god can do
[1:24:12] and it certainly is that's just
[1:24:14] beautiful
[1:24:24] and then we'll turn in st john the 14th
[1:24:27] i mean mark excuse me the 14th chapter
[1:24:32] and the 12
[1:24:34] the 12th verse and we just read the
[1:24:37] communion story
[1:24:39] according to mark
[1:24:42] it says
[1:24:44] and
[1:24:45] it says in
[1:24:47] the first day
[1:24:48] of the unleavened bread
[1:24:51] when they
[1:24:52] killed the passover
[1:24:54] his disciples said unto him where wilt
[1:25:00] thou
[1:25:00] that we go
[1:25:02] and prepare that thou may eateth the
[1:25:06] passover
[1:25:08] and he sent them forth two of his
[1:25:11] disciples
[1:25:12] and said unto them
[1:25:14] go ye into the city
[1:25:17] and there
[1:25:18] shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher
[1:25:22] of water
[1:25:24] follow him
[1:25:26] and wheresoever he shall go in
[1:25:31] say
[1:25:32] ye
[1:25:33] to the good man of the house
[1:25:36] the master saith where is thy guest
[1:25:40] chamber
[1:25:42] where i shall eat the passover with my
[1:25:46] disciples
[1:25:48] and he will show you a large upper room
[1:25:53] furnished
[1:25:54] and prepared
[1:25:56] there make ready for us
[1:26:00] isn't that the supernatural
[1:26:02] and then that isn't that what we've seen
[1:26:04] displayed in our day
[1:26:06] amen same spirit
[1:26:09] and his disciples went forth and came
[1:26:12] unto
[1:26:13] the city
[1:26:14] and found as he had said
[1:26:17] unto them
[1:26:18] and they made ready the passover
[1:26:22] and in the evening he cometh with the
[1:26:25] twelve
[1:26:27] and as they sat and did eat
[1:26:30] jesus said verily i say unto you
[1:26:35] one of you which eateth with me
[1:26:37] shall betray me
[1:26:40] and they begin to be sorrowful
[1:26:43] and to say
[1:26:45] unto him one by one
[1:26:48] is it i and another said
[1:26:52] is it i
[1:26:54] and he answered and said unto them
[1:26:58] it is one of the twelve
[1:27:01] that dippeth with me
[1:27:04] in the dish
[1:27:07] and the son of man indeed goeth as it is
[1:27:11] written of him
[1:27:13] but woe to that
[1:27:15] man
[1:27:16] whom the son of man is betrayed
[1:27:20] good
[1:27:21] were it for that man if he had never
[1:27:25] been born
[1:27:27] and as they did eat jesus took bread and
[1:27:32] blessed and break it
[1:27:34] and giveth to them
[1:27:37] and
[1:27:38] say take eat this is my body
[1:27:42] and he took
[1:27:43] the cup
[1:27:45] and when
[1:27:47] he had given thanks
[1:27:49] he gave it to them
[1:27:51] and they all drank of it
[1:27:54] and he said unto them this is my blood
[1:27:59] of the new testament
[1:28:01] which is shed for many
[1:28:04] verily i say unto you i will drink no
[1:28:06] more of the fruit of the vine until
[1:28:10] that day
[1:28:11] that i drink it anew in the kingdom of
[1:28:14] god
[1:28:16] and when they had sung
[1:28:18] a hymn
[1:28:19] they went out
[1:28:20] unto the mount
[1:28:22] of olives amen
[1:28:26] amen you brother

[1:28:38] our gracious heavenly father

[1:28:50] passover with your disciples
[1:28:53] and you break bread and you blessed it
[1:28:56] and you gave it unto them
[1:28:58] and you said it was your body

[1:29:29] that in the great crucifixion

[1:29:36] were

[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:52] so
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:38:23] my
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:37] oh
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:55] amen isn't the
[1:38:56] word of god
[1:38:58] wonderful
[1:38:59] you know there's so many things that you
[1:39:01] can
[1:39:06] derive from god's word
[1:39:08] you know jesus saying
[1:39:11] there he says is
[1:39:13] one of the twelve
[1:39:15] it just kind of
[1:39:17] broadens to our
[1:39:18] heart that there must have been more
[1:39:20] than just the twelve there
[1:39:23] you know we think so many times
[1:39:25] from what
[1:39:26] history has said that there was only 12
[1:39:29] people there but he sent two of his
[1:39:32] disciples it didn't mean it was two of
[1:39:34] the
[1:39:35] twelve
[1:39:36] and then the scripture said he came with
[1:39:39] the 12.
[1:39:41] so you know when you begin to understand
[1:39:43] that this was a a beautiful body
[1:39:46] of believers there
[1:39:48] people that had been healed and
[1:39:51] and you think maybe the woman at the
[1:39:54] well was there and and i i take all the
[1:39:57] people the the young boy that was blind
[1:40:00] that sat there and questioned the
[1:40:02] pharisees one of my favorite parts of
[1:40:04] the scripture you saying
[1:40:07] that you're the fathers of israel and
[1:40:09] you don't know by what spirit
[1:40:12] you're healed
[1:40:14] i think that's one of the greatest
[1:40:16] commentaries in the scripture of this
[1:40:19] young
[1:40:20] person sitting there explaining and the
[1:40:23] scripture says they threw them out
[1:40:27] and then jesus went and found them
[1:40:30] and he followed him can you just imagine
[1:40:33] in your mind who is there
[1:40:35] taking communion
[1:40:37] uh blind bartimaeus
[1:40:40] i believe he was there
[1:40:41] and i just go through the scriptures
[1:40:43] what a can you imagine the testimonies
[1:40:47] in that room that night as they
[1:40:50] all sat there and had supper
[1:40:53] with the lord amen let's turn over in
[1:40:56] our bibles to
[1:40:59] the gospel of
[1:41:00] of saint john
[1:41:04] and let us stand as we
[1:41:07] read in the 13th chapter
[1:41:20] and it says now
[1:41:22] before the feast of the passover
[1:41:25] when jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:41:29] that he should depart out of this world
[1:41:32] unto the father
[1:41:33] having loved his own which were in the
[1:41:36] world he loved him to the end
[1:41:39] and supper being ended
[1:41:42] the devil having now put it into the
[1:41:45] heart
[1:41:46] of judas iscariot simon's son to betray
[1:41:50] him
[1:41:51] jesus knowing
[1:41:53] that the father had given all things
[1:41:56] into his hands
[1:41:58] and that he was come from god and went
[1:42:02] to god
[1:42:04] he raiseth from supper
[1:42:07] and laid aside his garments and took a
[1:42:10] towel
[1:42:11] and girdeth himself and after that he
[1:42:15] had poureth water into a basin
[1:42:18] and began to wash the disciples feet
[1:42:22] and to wipe them with the towel
[1:42:25] wherewith he was girded
[1:42:27] then cometh heat to simon peter and
[1:42:30] peter said unto him
[1:42:32] lord dost thou wash my feet
[1:42:36] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:42:40] what i do thou knoweth not now but thou
[1:42:44] shalt know hereafter
[1:42:46] and peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:42:50] wash my feet
[1:42:53] pretty strong huh
[1:42:57] jesus answered him
[1:42:59] if i wash thee not
[1:43:02] thou hath no part with me
[1:43:05] simon peter said unto him lord
[1:43:09] not my feet only
[1:43:11] but also
[1:43:12] my hands and my head
[1:43:16] jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:43:18] needeth not saved to watch his feet but
[1:43:22] is clean every wit ye are clean but not
[1:43:27] all
[1:43:28] for he knew who should betray him
[1:43:30] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:43:34] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:43:38] had taken his garments
[1:43:40] and was set down again he said unto them
[1:43:44] know ye what i have done
[1:43:47] to you
[1:43:48] ye call me master and lord
[1:43:50] and ye say well
[1:43:52] for so i am
[1:43:54] if i then your lord and master have
[1:43:56] washed your feet
[1:43:58] ye also ought to wash one another's feet
[1:44:01] for i have given you an example that ye
[1:44:04] should do as i have done to you
[1:44:08] verily verily i say unto you
[1:44:10] the servant is not greater than his lord
[1:44:14] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:44:19] that sent him
[1:44:21] if you know these things happy are ye
[1:44:24] if you do them
[1:44:26] amen there's one sure way to be happy
[1:44:28] according to god's word and that's when
[1:44:31] it wash one another's feet god bless you
