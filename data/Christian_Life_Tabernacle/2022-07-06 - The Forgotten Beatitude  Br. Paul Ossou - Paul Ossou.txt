go through trials but you know the only real peace that we have is in the lord and in his word amen let's just sing this as brother david comes will the only real peace only real peace [Music] [Laughter] [Music] i need you lord i know i dear oh [Music] amen i just wanted to make a couple announcements tonight before brother paul ministers the word to us i wanted to acknowledge that sister rachel tomomo where are you rachel you're here somewhere no you're gone you're off i don't see you okay well she's heading to italy uh to be married on august 4. she leaves this saturday so we just want to let you know that and and that you could uh keep her in your prayers and i know jenna and ben they left for alabama today so we want to keep them in their prayers and then we also want to remember brother daring his family they leave tomorrow for the his father's funeral so let's keep them in prayer and then uh this uh sunday morning i've asked jackson to address the church and share with you the direction that the lord's leading his life so he'll do that sunday morning so you know we just want you don't want no speculations or anything you just want to understand everything and it's better to hear it from brother jackson than than anybody else we all know that he's leaving but we'll let him share that with you sunday morning but this these two statements came to my heart and i thought they were wonderful it says god has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill all his works god knows just exactly what he's going to do we don't we just have to receive it as he gives it to us but he knows and there's nothing going to go wrong with what he has planned to do aren't you glad of that now sometimes i don't know what in the world he's doing but i do know it's going to come out okay amen and he says there and he says it comes about there has to be sometimes rugged and hard things to only bring out the real true nature of the object he says and god sets a time and has a purpose for everything that he does there is nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the lord and are called according to his calling see we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie and he said that was so that everything has its time it's season and it has its way and god is behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong and it's up to us those things are just put upon us trials and wonderings and testings to see how we'll react on any action so we know that everything is perfectly set in order by god's plan you know i i don't know i'm going this sunday to a funeral of a friend of mine a very close friend in fact he was the brother that came with me here when we first came to fort worth for the very first time to try to get something started and i've been places with them and fished with them and lived with them and and this was the time that god chose to take him home this was the time that god chose to take darian's father home you know he's got this is the time he chose for rachel to get married this is the time he chases for every move we just got to trust in the fact that he's got a harmonious plan that everything works good so we don't have to get upset at anything amen my goal is to find that plan to find that will and try to walk in it the best we can so let's sing amazing grace how sweet the sound as our brother comes and keep me in prayer i'm going to go on a very heavy dose of medicine for the next two or three days so i can travel the doctor said you need to stay isolated for five days i said yeah and then he says no traveling and he said oh he said by the way does that interrupt your plans i said yeah he says well do whatever you want depending on how you feel says that's a good doctor right there so we're going to be fine and i think everybody suffered a little this sinus and little sore throat and this dust and everything and you get a little older it hits you a little harder but we're doing fine so we'll be great so let's just love one another keep loving one another pretty soon we'll all be there and we'll all be together and everything's gonna be perfect i'll guarantee you that so god bless you amazing grace amen [Music] me oh [Music] let's pray [Music] god our father but it's true that we were lost we were blind [Music] it's you that brought us back it's you that give us life it's you that's everything for us that's why tonight oh lord we know that we come to you with the constant conscious service father we give us this service to you on twitter that you may take the control and the preeminence of everything [Music] father remember brother david let me tell you the doctors can say something but you are more than doctors you are the great physician and you are everything to us to be in your presence tonight in the name of the lord jesus amen god bless you god bless you i believe we're happy to be in the house of god tonight i trust you're praying for me i was standing by the billy uh just a while ago maybe next year i'll try to preach my first sermon in english and then i will try to i take a poll or figure out if people really understood my accent i told them yeah why don't you start tonight it's not possible i will try to read the bible myself in english we don't believe the material let's open our bibles in uh matthew the gospel of matthew oh in the 11th chapter i will read verse 6. and blessings he was over shall not be offended in me a luke shapiro answer and luke uh chapter 11 numerology verse 7273 i will read verse 27 and 28. luke the eleventh chapter event eventually the verse twenty seven and twenty eight and it came to pass as expected things a certain woman of the company lifted up a voice and said unto him blessing the womb that body and the perps which thou art stuck but he said yeah you had a blessing a day that you the word of god and keep it god bless you god bless you [Music] the past two minutes that brother david was up here he almost preached what i had in my heart tonight i almost felt like just closing my bible and saying well that's all i wanted to say god may god bless him richly uh the scriptures that we just read is eventually [Music] i want to title my little sermon tonight the forgotten beatitudes preached a sermon called forgotten beatitude [Music] and he took the scripture in matthew 11. and now tonight i will try to uh uh uh come up or add uh luke 11 in the attitude in luke 11. when we speak about beatitude the attitude the attitude speaks of it's a supreme blessing [Music] perfect in other places it speaks about it's a supreme blessing of the elected ones in paradise [Music] it's uh it's a perfect happiness it's a perfect state of satisfaction and jesus when he started his ministry we know that a portrait or on the wall that speaks about uh the sermon on the mount the scripture says jesus was on the mountain and the disciples came to him he called it that's when he started telling his disciples [Music] it says happy are those that are poor in spirit because they shall inherit the kingdom of god happy are those peacemakers because they shall be called sons of god that jesus was presenting to his disciples when you go to matthew chapter 11 assembly he says he is a beatitude that seems to have gotten lost when jesus was bringing his sermon happy will you be sorry it says happy to him that i'm the or to one that i'm not a stumbling block all right the circumstances you have the circumstance under which jesus is presenting this beatitude when we go back to the bible you see it was concerning a great man of god a great it was one who was chosen to present our lord jesus when in his first coming series it was whom that jesus presented it says it was the greatest solution it was the one who received the holy ghost when he was still in his mother's womb ministry according to the plan that god had for him to fulfill it and as he had the spirit of elijah the foundation is speaking of faith says it's a spirit that doesn't compromise john the baptist was the same way when he came in front of errol and because of that john the baptist was put in prison when john the baptist found himself in the prison he began to think about a lot of things it was something that was enclosed to him it was dirty uh john the baptist began to think or reflect on his walk it comes to a time when uh most of us don't start in in our walk with the lord we find ourselves in certain difficulties situation we find ourselves in undesired circumstances we find ourselves in very hard trials where sometimes you don't even see the end of your trial and sometimes you begin to ask yourself questions [Music] is it really the fact that i believe this message was it true do i continue should i continue with the lord do i should continue me should i continue to love him brother david was saying a moment ago it was predestinated but when john the baptist found themselves in this situation his eyes of eagle view was coming down and he began to think about certain things he said certain he certainly asked himself [Music] that the messiah that i knew the messiah that i was supposed to present i'm wondering if he's doing anything to try to get me out was it him was it him that was supposed to come back john the baptist began to ask himself questions was he him was he the messiah it was god who showed him because it's the one on whom the spirit is going to descend as the dove he will be the messiah and john spoke with certitude voicing behold the lamb of god you ought to push it who takes away the sin of the world but when he finds himself in this trial his view or his eyesight was dead his faith came down his revelation was affected he sent his disciples i live versus jesus go to that jesus you say go to the one that i presented ask them a question was he really the ones that was supposed to come won't call no different or should we wait for another joy john came to a place where he was close to denying his own testimony denying what god did with him denying everything that god showed him because they find themselves in a difficult trial he sent his disciples when the disciple came to jesus jesus didn't provide arguments jesus jesus brought them back to a meeting jesus preached the word jesus showed what the word was talking about position jesus put the word in position and when the service was over jesus told them because your papa would be [Applause] sinners are saved that this word still has the power of transformation just go give him the testimony that's when jesus pronounces this beatitude happy to him that i'm not going to be a stumbling block for the one who's not offended in me in other words happy is he who's never gonna complain about being a christian happy is he who will find that my word doesn't have a place that's good because you connected god knows everything and because god predestinated us as his children that's why the bible tells us in the book of lamentation uh chapter 3 is there anything that happened in the city unless the lord is the author of it isn't it by the desire of the the highest one that that all the things come and why is a man who lives why would he complain that man will complain about his own sin giant god is asking us to be happy in walking with him he says happy you are you it is even when we are persecuted i don't know even when people are gonna mark us sometimes they're gonna tell you what appearance you have but god tells us happy are we when they're gonna mark us but one of them says don't lie ephesians church age paragraph catholic uh paragraph 88 secretary well didn't jesus say blessed are you when you are you are persecuted jesus said you shall be happy happy are you calling for when people are mocking you only a devil body instead of them uh are cursing you he'll push our belief they are moving god to come and bless you either benedict they are attracting god's blessing upon you the people in the bible with yourself we are putting ourselves in john's place this great man who who came and and presented the messiah but he could find himself in prison or fell where he is closed in by himself so with with no hope somehow the nouvelle with no news of the messiah that he just presented it was very dark for him but god was always there it called the disciples and when the disciples of john came to jesus christ jesus never said anything bad about the person he never said anything bad about john regardless of how dim his vision was it can who did you go and see it is john john malgresa vision regardless of a deep-sighted job more famous my brother my sister regardless of your dream sighted if you could do like regardless of the difficulties that you find yourself in future predestination if you are predestinated to be a son and a daughter jesus god is looking at you in the same position god is not looking at the testimonies of man god is not looking at what people are saying about you he's looking at what he's done for you he said john was the greatest of all the prophets and and and [Applause] and jesus is saying the same thing for every son and daughter of god whatever what he's telling us happy uh a happy are you that who's not offended in me that the word of god that jesus christ that it may not be something a stumbling block for you that we may find ourselves happy when they're gonna make fun of us it says but when the trouble set in and when the trouble set in jesus come and show the messiah showed the messiah he was the messiah but when something went wrong john had introduced the messiah with with with the fan in his hand going to burn up the shaft but he found out that the works of jesus he was meek and lowly so awarded irori he worried him he didn't know he didn't know what he what what to say he thought now there's something wrong here somewhere seem he had he had believed the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working right and there's many times that we think too we we think too it says that isn't working that isn't it isn't working right but it but it's working right amen and as long as we know that is here what difference does it make it's working right maybe it ain't working working it to the way that we think he ought to work it but it's working according to the way that god wants it to work sometimes we think it doesn't work because it's not working according to our understanding but god is in control it's working exactly how god wants it to work it's working according to the program of god it's working according to the plan of god but but to god it had to work that way for jesus for god he had to go in that direction and all that the devil does is to bring us to a place where we will doubt of god that's what he brought john the baptist to do he says i mean he's trying to bring us to doubt the word of god to doubt a portion of the scripture but the bible tells us that men shall not leave my bread alone but by every word not by all the word but by every word but the devil can bring us in certain circumstances this morning but when i was speaking about possessing the gates of your enemy he said that god has already brought us to the place where we could possess all the gates in the situation but he can bring us into a situation where everybody is against us even those that are close to us become against us it says in that time you have to stand sure he said he can let the devil do whatever he wants only he will ask him not to touch your life the purpose for the devil is to try to bring you in a circumstance where the word becomes a stumbling block that jesus may become an offense but jesus says are those that are not offended in me he says in the forgotten beatitude paragraph 41 it says and i i i believe there are more people offended in jesus than any other person that ever lived on earth in so 52 raped they get offended too quick jesus no don't be attitude jesus now in this misplaced beatitude slipped over no matter what takes place everything is working right on schedule just go ahead and believe it that's all everything's all right continues [Music] god is saying that everything is working according to the schedule in the most extreme difficulties like the three hebrew children he's gonna reveal himself as the fourth man in the fire he drives everything according to his program amen all that he's asking us taking the swapper you know because of the shoot that he may be that he may he may not be an offense for us that the circumstances of life think it's jesus i know cause of the that they may not lead us to a place where jesus becomes an offense okay that this word becomes an offense this message becomes an offense for you that's a little that's the attitude of we read in matthew 11. mcconnell's a lord of mark don't look but when we got to luke 11. we have another beatitude and when you go and you read this book of luke this chapter you will see that in the beginning jesus is talking to his disciples showing them how to pray he showed them the prayer of our uh our father thou in heaven hospitality he spoke to them about hospitality he talked to them about god being one that provides to our needs that when we ask for something he will give it to us that it's wonderful that has that of uh have earthly fathers he showed them how demons can work into the people he said when someone believes the word he says that there is a demon that's cast out of that man but that demon will go and find seven more that are stronger than him that when they come back if the house is not filled by god he comes back and the situation is worse than it was before jesus was there carrying out his meetings wonderful the scripture says there was one who was mute jesus prayed for him and he was healed there was so much power to insert an assembly that a sister in the assembly come loose just like we are sitting here in church the womb that carried you he said blessed is the one that carried you and the perhaps that that suckered jesus didn't look at it jesus returned back to her it says a happy is more that those that hears the word and that does it and yeah not just to think of what god did yesterday but to know that that same god is present here present tense concealer delivered completely [Applause] and the one who keeps it the one who lives the word who doesn't just come and rejoice over the word it's wonderful to rejoice of the word only when we put in practice this word because when this word becomes our lies jesus says as he was so are we also are we supposed to be he said he said he's able to bring it to pass something that's holding us back on our side it wants to mean that it's for us to come more closer to him happy a preacher's uh story it's for every believer and even the preacher who stands behind the pulpit plus it's not higher than that an evil man who just uh a drunk man who just converted himself that the afternoon all this beatitude is concerning us that people will see christ in our life that's the word of god may be manifested that we may attract people to this word yes we live we've come to a time where people have difficulties believing the word of god and oftentimes it's because i started calling ourselves christians we are not coming to a place where we can clearly reflect this jesus christ in the world in our midst he says in a little bit well in a while the world will not see me anymore but you shall see me you shall see me because i'll be with you and even in you he promised that he was going to be in us and if it is in us he does a reflection he has to reflect himself he let him know if it's in us it doesn't present he has to present himself if he's in us the world has to see him in a message uh a blessing prophet i'm guilty of not doing the job of god like i should look like i should do i'm confessing it she shouldn't leave her i'm that i'm wrong if you do more that you don't miss i'm asking god to be merciful to me i'll look out here and see the opportunities i have missed because of petty things little old insignificant things that didn't mean nothing i'm ashamed of myself i repent before god and i asked god to forgive me a priestly gliese me pardon and the church to forgive me for being so dilatory about the work of god by the grace of god and by the help of god i'll not listen to what it means everyone trying to tell me everyone trying to tell you something to do he's on calculator they got a program they've got something that you should that you for you to do nonsense nonsense i know god's program and i'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the gospel [Music] one million souls won i ought to have 10 million souls won there yeah i'm way behind connected i'm way behind what about you how many souls you want since you've you've been in christ the christian needs to communicate a lot christianity just goes from one to another how many souls you want since you've been a christian [Music] if you are not winning souls you are guilty with this theory you are barren buddhaville manila aunt silly gliese you've brought shame on the church and the gospel how many people how many people you get out you get out for wednesday night prayer meetings [Music] if you don't do if you're not doing it you ought to be ashamed of yourself before christ with that you are guilty and your place is at the altar that's part of what i'm speaking and who keeps it conscious when jesus resurrected his commission was to all of us everybody i lived go in all the world faith make of all the nations my disciples it's a commission that god gave to each one welcome sir brother or sister or pray entity we can invite the secretary that's what that's what god asked us to do and if tonight we have not done it we are guilty the bible tells us in luke 13. it's jesus who was giving a parable look 33 uh luke chapter 13 about universities and from verse six you see that parable and he speak also this parable and ave and figure frontier a certain man had a fake planet in his vineyard and he and he came and saw the fruit thereof and found none along the dresser of the vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit of this fig of this fig and a fine nine couple cut it down why convert it in the ground and and the answer and he answered and said unto him lord leslie let it alone this year also till i dig around i i dig about it and dang it and if and if they bear fruit you know well if not then after that after that that shall cut it down i believe the lord has given us time yeah it's word it says it's going to come and it's going to water it the water will come and it will put the dung around it so we can produce the fruit so we can be those that are blessed by hearing and keeping. so we can walk as christians [Music] so we can express god to the world that's dying you know nature is groaning the nature is waiting for us to be it's us that are keeping the rapture from happening may god give us his grace may god help us that we may walk as christians you please [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] me [Music] god [Music] i believe that there is no one who is jesus certain more if [Music] father i'm probably the most concerned of all [Music] peace i pray lord the knew that misery called jesus father to be merciful to us tonight father to remember each and every one of us oh comes that parabol father like this parable give us another year long that your word may water us when your word may be like the fertilizer around us by the way it's not depending on who that's that neither stupid it's not about who runs or who who and i believe you you the moment has come for you to manifest us we give ourselves back to you father take us as an offering [Music] father that you may make of us what you want us to be like guide us where you want us to go because [Music] that only your name be lifted up lord manifest that manifest your glory a complete bring your word again the past [Music] you said your word is like the rain once it rains it will not return back forward but father it will bring forth that which you have standed for [Music] we bless you tonight and we know that you're going to bring us you're going to attract us to you more than in the name of the lord jesus [Music] [Music] wonderful just to i just marvel at how the holy ghost just come and deals with us like sons and daughters and builds us up and tells us who we are and then comes kind of spanks us a little bit he tells us hey you're predestinated you're elected everything's working out right on schedule everything's right on time but how many souls have you won and then to hear the prophet you know when you hear words like that it should cause a deep concern for us to look inwardly if you know the prophet's not just playing he means that he's being sincere he's being humble say lord i've only won a million souls i should have won 10 million by now that makes me say oh god 20 23 years serving you how many souls have i won look everyone say lord dig around the roots lord is that your hearts does our lord dig around the roots lord don't get fertilized lord i want to be fruitful lord jesus blessed is he who is not offended in me blessed is he who is not offended in the word made flesh i love what he said he said the devil wants to he wants to get you to a place that where you are offended by the word you know this just come to mind while the brother was ministering you know when when god gave brother branham that vision i believe was on december 22nd 1962 he was he had the vision of the constellation of angels and he come out of that vision he was reading romans 9 33. behold i lay in zion a stumbling block you know what it's a blessed is he who's not offended offended means a stumbling block behold i lay in zion a a stumbling block a rock of a fence but but he who believeth on him shall not be ashamed and and he come out of that vision and he said why am i reading that it'd be strange that i'd be reading romans 9 33 coming out of that vision he said lord if that be you let me turn there again and sure enough he come right back there to romans 9 33 and it was coupled with that vision which was that third pull which was the unfolding of the word it it was the very revealing of christ what it was behold the lamb behold the lamb and blessed is he who is not offended in me and i love how the brother brought that out he he said you know uh in john's dim-sidedness it didn't change who he was oh can't you start to praise the lord many times we get dim sighted the eagle scales get on our eyes and we forget who we are but it doesn't change who you are jesus says just go tell john what this word is producing just go tell them what this message of the hour is producing just go tell them go tell my disciples he is risen he is alive and living in a people and then he proceeded to say no there wasn't a man born before or after like john and i believe god is looking down at you the bride of jesus christ say there's never a lady ever on the face of the earth like this bride oh church we're gonna make it we're gonna make it amen oh we're going all the way let's sing that going all the way aren't you just
