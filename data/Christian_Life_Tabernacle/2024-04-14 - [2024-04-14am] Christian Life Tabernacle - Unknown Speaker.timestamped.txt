[1:09] elected

[1:40] resurrected savior our lord Jesus still
[1:43] lives we ask you to bless us now in
[1:46] jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless
[1:50] you you may be seated this morning
[2:00] this morning before we do
[2:03] anything um I want to
[2:06] play a portion
[2:10] of um from the sermon called God in
[2:18] Simplicity or God's revealed in simp uh
[2:22] hides himself in
[2:24] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[2:28] same and it is is the portion of the
[2:31] tape where brother Brenham
[2:33] dedicated
[2:35] um the
[2:37] Tabernacle uh they remodeled the
[2:39] Tabernacle they rebuilt it they added on
[2:42] to it they totally changed it and he
[2:44] took the first few minutes uh thanking
[2:48] all the people that worked on it and and
[2:51] I'd like to do the same and uh our sound
[2:54] system is much better I've never heard
[2:56] myself preach before until this morning
[2:59] morning and and
[3:02] um and you know brother Mike and brother
[3:05] Billy and Brother David and Neville and
[3:09] Billy uh number two and all of them
[3:12] worked so hard to uh get our sound going
[3:17] and through the construction brother
[3:19] Tommy brother Andrew many of the
[3:21] brothers helped work many of you put a
[3:25] lot of effort
[3:26] into uh making this happen and and it's
[3:30] done for you so we'd like to thank all
[3:32] of you that labored it was uh your
[3:37] giving uh that made it your your
[3:40] offerings and your tithings have brought
[3:43] uh made this possible this morning so we
[3:48] certainly want to thank all of you in
[3:51] your effort we it's here to serve you I
[3:54] suppose we could have kept cramming into
[3:56] the other building but I don't know are
[3:59] the pews more
[4:00] comfortable amen I hope you're more
[4:03] comfortable uh I hope the air
[4:06] conditioning is good there might be a
[4:08] lot of little things that we don't know
[4:11] but we trust that as uh we go along
[4:15] we'll make adjustments and there's
[4:18] probably plenty of adjustments that need
[4:20] to be made but uh we're we're thankful
[4:23] for this this morning so let us and then
[4:26] right after we listen to this portion of
[4:28] tape we'll start our first service so uh
[4:34] I know people are still probably coming
[4:36] in and we're going to have to do a
[4:38] little better on that but listen now to
[4:43] as our
[4:45] messenger begins to speak to us about
[4:50] how that we should conduct ourself and
[4:53] what the purpose of the house of the
[4:56] Lord is so the first person I wanted to
[4:59] preach in this church or to speak in
[5:02] this church was God's seventh angel
[5:05] messenger the prophet of Malachi for so
[5:09] God bless you this morning as we listen
[5:11] God bless you
[5:15] Brothers now in the building I think
[5:19] that we ought to have in this if it's
[5:22] been dedicated or going to be dedicated
[5:25] in a few minutes to the worship of God
[5:28] we should keep it that
[5:31] way we should never buy ourselves in the
[5:35] building we should never uh do any
[5:38] business in this Auditorium here it
[5:41] should never be done in here that is
[5:44] such as permitting ministers that come
[5:47] in and sell books and everything no
[5:50] matter what it is there's other places
[5:51] to do that water we we shouldn't buy and
[5:54] sell in the house of Our Lord it should
[5:57] be a place of of of worship holy
[6:01] consecrated for that
[6:04] purpose let give us a nice place let's
[6:07] dedicate it to him and dedicate
[6:10] ourselves with it to him and now this
[6:14] may seem a little rude but it's not a
[6:17] place to visit it's a place of worship
[6:22] we should never even murmur a word
[6:25] inside of here outside of worship to one
[6:28] another unless it's absolutely
[6:33] necessary we should never rally around
[6:36] we should never run through the building
[6:38] or let our children run through the
[6:40] building and so doing this feeling not
[6:43] long ago that of doing this we
[6:46] constructed it so we could take care of
[6:48] all of it now we have this set here of
[6:52] course many people are strangers the
[6:55] Tabernacle folks know this that the
[6:59] building is going to be dedicated to the
[7:01] service of the almighty therefore
[7:05] dedicating ourselves let's remember when
[7:08] we enter that Sanctuary keep still to
[7:12] one another and worship God if we want
[7:16] to visit each other there's places we
[7:18] may visit each other like that but never
[7:21] walking around where you can't hear
[7:23] yourself think and some person come in
[7:26] and they just don't know what to do see
[7:28] it's so much noise and things it's just
[7:31] humanly and I've seen it in churches
[7:34] until it has made me feel real bad
[7:37] because we do not come into the
[7:39] sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other
[7:42] we come here to worship God then go to
[7:46] our homes this Sanctuary is dedicated to
[7:50] worship when stand outside talk anything
[7:53] you wish to as long as it's right and
[7:56] holy go to one another's homes visit one
[7:59] another places but when you enter that
[8:01] door be quiet you come here to talk to
[8:04] him see and let him talk back to you the
[8:08] trouble of it is we do too much talking
[8:11] and don't listen enough then when we
[8:14] come in here wait on him now in the old
[8:18] Tabernacle there might not be one person
[8:21] present this morning that was there the
[8:24] day of the dedication when major olry
[8:26] played the music and I stood behind
[8:28] Three cross is here to dedicate the
[8:31] place I would not permit anybody the
[8:34] Usher stood at the door to see that
[8:36] nobody
[8:38] talked when you're done your talking
[8:40] outside you come in if you desire to
[8:44] silently you come to the Altar and
[8:47] prayed silently you walk back to your
[8:50] seat opened up the
[8:52] Bible what your neighbor done that was
[8:54] up to him you had nothing to say if you
[8:56] want to talk to him say I'll see him
[8:58] outside I'm in here to Worship the Lord
[9:01] you read his word or set
[9:05] quietly then the music sister Gertie I
[9:08] don't know where she's here this morning
[9:09] or not sister Gibbs the old piano I'll
[9:13] be set back in this corner the best of
[9:16] my
[9:17] remembrance and she would play softly
[9:22] down at the cross where my savior died
[9:26] some real sweet soft music
[9:30] and and then until it come time for the
[9:35] service and the song leader got up and
[9:38] led a couple of congregational songs and
[9:41] then if they had some outstanding solo
[9:44] they sang
[9:45] it but never just a bunch of carrying
[9:49] on and then the music continually played
[9:52] and then when I heard that I know it
[9:54] it's my time to come out when a minister
[9:57] walks into a Congregation of people
[10:00] praying and the anointing of the spirit
[10:02] you're bound to hear from Heaven that's
[10:05] there's no way to keep from it but if
[10:07] you walk into confusion then you you're
[10:11] you're so confused and the spirit's
[10:13] grieved and we don't want that no we
[10:16] want to come here to worship we have
[10:20] lovely homes and I'm going to speak
[10:21] about just in a minute and so forth at
[10:23] home where we visit our friends and take
[10:25] them this is the house of the Lord now
[10:29] there's little
[10:30] children now little babies now they
[10:34] don't know no different they the only
[10:36] way they can get what they want is cry
[10:39] for and sometimes it's a drink of water
[10:42] sometimes they need attention and so we
[10:46] have by the grace of God dedicated a
[10:50] room it is called on the list a cry room
[10:53] but uh it's right straight in front of
[10:56] me it's other words where the mothers
[10:58] can take their Bab babies now it's never
[11:02] bothers maybe me here at the pull pit
[11:04] maybe I won't even notice it being
[11:06] anointed but these other people sitting
[11:08] near and it bothers them see and they
[11:11] come here to hear the service so the
[11:14] mothers is your little baby starts
[11:16] whimpering you can't help that well sure
[11:19] it's a you should you ought to bring it
[11:20] a real mother wants to take her baby to
[11:22] church and that's thing you should do
[11:25] and we've got a room there that where
[11:27] you can see every corner of the building
[11:30] all the auditorium and a speaker there
[11:32] to where you can control the volume any
[11:34] way you want to with a a little toilet
[11:37] in the end and water basin and
[11:40] everything just exactly for the mother's
[11:42] convenience with chairs and things you
[11:44] can sit down place to change your baby
[11:47] it needs to be changed and everything
[11:49] setting there it's all fixed and then
[11:52] many times teenage children and
[11:55] sometimes adults or get the you know
[11:58] young people of past notes or cut up or
[12:00] something in church now you're old
[12:03] enough to know better than that see you
[12:04] should know better than that see you
[12:06] shouldn't come here if you expect to be
[12:08] a real man someday and raise a family to
[12:11] the kingdom of God then start it off in
[12:14] the beginning you see and and act right
[12:17] and do right and now of course now the
[12:20] ushers stands at the corners of the
[12:22] buildings and so forth and if any
[12:24] carrying on they they're
[12:26] ordained as their Duty and set here in
[12:30] the front that in a case of someone
[12:33] getting misbehaving there are
[12:35] commissioned to ask the person to keep
[12:38] quiet then if they don't have that
[12:42] respect it would be better that uh
[12:46] someone else had to seat because there's
[12:48] somebody that wants to hear there's
[12:50] somebody come for that purpose to hear
[12:52] and that's what we're here for is to
[12:54] hear the word of the Lord and so
[12:57] everybody wants to hear it want just as
[12:59] quiet as they can be just as quiet as
[13:02] they can be that is not a bunch of
[13:04] talking and carry on or somebody
[13:06] worshiping the Lord that's expected
[13:08] that's what it should be that's what
[13:10] you're here for is to Worship the Lord
[13:13] just if you feel like praising God or
[13:16] shouting just go right on see because
[13:19] that's what you're here for see but is
[13:22] to Worship the Lord in your own way of
[13:24] worshiping but there's nobody worships
[13:27] the Lord while you're talking and
[13:29] passing notes and you're helping
[13:31] somebody else to get away from the
[13:32] worship of the Lord see so we feel that
[13:36] that that would be wrong and we want to
[13:39] make that a ruling in our church that in
[13:42] our congregation that to this building
[13:45] this church will be dedicated to the
[13:48] kingdom of God and to the preaching of
[13:50] the
[13:51] word
[13:53] pray worship that's the reason you
[13:56] should come here to worship man
[14:00] and then another thing when service is
[14:02] over usually the people in churches I
[14:06] don't I don't think it share because I'm
[14:07] always gone see because I get away
[14:10] usually even in preaching other services
[14:13] anointing comes and Visions happen and
[14:16] I'm wore out and I step off into the
[14:18] room and maybe Billy or some of the man
[14:20] there take me on uh to home and let me
[14:24] rest a while till I get out of it
[14:27] because it's a very much of a stream and
[14:29] then I have seen churches old that where
[14:33] the children were permitted to run all
[14:35] over the sanctuary and and uh the adults
[14:38] standing and holling across the room to
[14:41] one
[14:42] another that's a good way to ruin the
[14:44] service coming at night or whatever time
[14:46] it is see as soon as the service is
[14:50] dismissed leave the auditorium you're
[14:53] through in the worship in they go out
[14:55] and talk to one another whatever you
[14:57] want to do if you got something you want
[14:58] to talk to somebody
[14:59] um to see you go with them or to their
[15:02] home or whatever it is but don't do it
[15:04] in the auditorium let's dedicate this to
[15:08] God Amen see this is his meeting place
[15:11] where we meet with him see and the law
[15:15] goes forth from the sanctuary of course
[15:18] and um I I believe that that would be
[15:21] pleasing to our Heavenly Father and then
[15:24] when you come and you get to find out
[15:27] that gifts are beginning to fall among
[15:30] now usually it I trust it'll never be
[15:33] here but when people have a new church
[15:37] the first thing you know the
[15:38] congregation get
[15:39] starchy you never want that to be after
[15:43] all this is a place of worship this is
[15:47] the house of the
[15:50] Lord and a spiritual gifts begin to come
[15:53] among you I understand that since I've
[15:55] been gone that people has moved in here
[15:58] from different parts of the country to
[15:59] make this your home I'm thankful
[16:03] grateful to God that I believe that the
[16:07] morning when I dedicated and laid that
[16:10] Cornerstone there as a young man I
[16:12] prayed for it standing to see the coming
[16:15] of Jesus
[16:17] Christ and when I did ow thousands of
[16:21] dollars and that you could take up an
[16:24] offering in a congregation this size and
[16:26] get 30 40 cents and our obligation was
[16:30] somewhat $15 $200 a month how could I
[16:34] ever do it and I noted I was working and
[16:38] I would pay it off I 17 years of
[16:40] pastoral without taking one cent but
[16:43] giving everything that I had myself
[16:45] outside my living and all that come into
[16:47] the little box on the back to the
[16:49] kingdom of God and people prophesied and
[16:53] predicted that within a year's time it
[16:55] would be turned into a
[16:57] garage Satan tried to take it away for
[17:00] one time in a flaw and a fraud of a
[17:04] lawsuit some man claim to hurt his foot
[17:06] while he's working on it and then let it
[17:08] go and then and sued and wanted to take
[17:10] the Tabernacle and for weeks I stood at
[17:14] the post but in spite of all the
[17:18] misunderstandings and the predictions
[17:20] and what they said she stands today is
[17:23] one of the prettiest auditoriums and the
[17:26] finest churches there is in the United
[17:28] States right from here as went the word
[17:31] of the Living God around the world
[17:36] around the world is constantly taking
[17:38] his circle around the globe from every
[17:40] nation under Heaven as far as around and
[17:43] around the world let us be thankful for
[17:46] this let us be grateful for this and now
[17:49] that we have a place to dwell in a roof
[17:52] under our head a clean nice Church to
[17:55] set in let's dedicate ourselves elves
[17:59] newly to the test and consecrate
[18:02] ourselves to
[18:04] Christ and brother Neville our Noble
[18:08] brother real Pastor servant of the
[18:12] Living
[18:13] God as far as that man knows the message
[18:16] he holds with it with all he's got
[18:19] that's right he's a gentle person he's a
[18:22] little uh afraid to not afraid I don't
[18:25] mean that but he's so so awful gentle
[18:28] he's just
[18:29] doesn't speak out you know like to to
[18:32] say a thing that's sharp and cutting or
[18:34] sit down or keep still I I noticed that
[18:37] listen to the tapes behind
[18:40] it
[18:42] but it so happens that I can do that so
[18:46] I uh I want you to remember my words
[18:50] this evening and this is all being taped
[18:54] see everything is taped and please let
[18:58] every Deacon stand to his post of Duty
[19:01] and remember that you're under a
[19:04] commission from God to hold that post
[19:07] sacred ever truste the same Pastor is to
[19:11] bring forth it isn't the pastor's place
[19:14] to have to say that it's the trustees
[19:16] are I mean the deacons for they are the
[19:18] police of the
[19:20] church that is if young couples come on
[19:22] the outside and blow horns and you know
[19:24] how they usually do or something like
[19:26] that meetings or get out there and
[19:28] mother sends her girl down here and she
[19:29] takes off out with some uh Renegade kid
[19:32] and run out there in a car and her
[19:33] mother thinks she's in church like that
[19:36] Deacon or seat of that you either come
[19:38] in here and sit down or I'm going to
[19:39] take you in my car and take you home to
[19:41] your mother see you must do that
[19:44] remember love is
[19:46] corrective always genuine love is
[19:49] corrective so you must be able to stand
[19:52] the correction and mothers know now that
[19:55] there's a place there for your babies
[19:57] you young kids know different than to
[19:59] run around over the village see and uh
[20:02] you had El know different than to talk
[20:04] and carry on your conversations in the
[20:05] auditorium see don't do that it's wrong
[20:08] it isn't pleasing to God Jesus said it
[20:12] is written my house shall be made a
[20:13] house of worship prayer out call the
[20:18] House of Prayer by All
[20:20] Nations and they were buying and selling
[20:23] and he platted ropes and ran the people
[20:26] out of the auditorium and we certainly
[20:29] don't want that to happen in this
[20:30] Sanctuary here so let's dedicate Our
[20:33] lives our church our task our service
[20:36] and everything we have to the kingdom of
[20:38] God now now I want to read some
[20:41] scriptures before we have the
[20:42] dedicational prayer and um and then it's
[20:45] just a rededication because real
[20:48] dedication happened 30 years
[20:51] ago now and uh then um then as we uh we
[20:58] read this scripture and talk on it for a
[21:02] few minutes I trust that God will bring
[21:04] his blessings to us and
[21:09] now uh there was another thing I was
[21:11] going to say yes where we used to have a
[21:14] recorders and so forth we got a regular
[21:16] room there where those who wants to take
[21:19] recordings there's special hookups and
[21:21] everything there that comes directly
[21:23] from the main m in there there's rooms
[21:26] robes everything for baptismal service
[21:29] and then one thing many people has
[21:33] always uh felt bad at me many people who
[21:36] really didn't know the scripture about
[21:39] having a crucifix in a
[21:42] church I remember one time oh something
[21:45] happened here about that I had a three
[21:47] crosses and a brother got All Shook Up
[21:50] because he heard another denomination
[21:52] say that a crucifix meant Catholic I
[21:56] want some student or
[21:59] somebody or some born again Christian to
[22:02] say the Catholics has got the option on
[22:04] the
[22:06] crucifix crucifix of Christ doesn't
[22:09] represent Catholicism that
[22:12] represents God the kingdom now Saints
[22:17] represent Catholicism we believe there's
[22:20] one mediator between God and man and
[22:22] that's Christ but Catholics believe in
[22:25] all kinds of mediators thousands of
[22:28] women and man and everything any good
[22:31] Catholic almost dies becomes an
[22:34] intercessor now crucifix of Christ
[22:38] represents Jesus
[22:40] Christ did you know the early Christians
[22:43] according to the the ancient history of
[22:47] the early church They Carried crosses on
[22:50] their
[22:51] backs wherever they went to signify and
[22:55] identify themselves as Christians
[22:58] now the Catholics claimed that with them
[23:00] of course they claimed they was the
[23:01] first ones but the Catholic Church
[23:03] wasn't even organized
[23:05] then but Christians packed the cross on
[23:08] you've heard people say crossback you
[23:11] refer that to Catholic it is the real
[23:14] Catholic the universal Holy Ghost Church
[23:17] of the world Amen correct we are
[23:21] Catholic we are the original Catholic
[23:24] the Bible believing Catholic see they
[23:27] are the church Catholic the organization
[23:30] we are free from that we are the
[23:33] continuation of the doctrine of the
[23:35] Apostles we are the continuation of the
[23:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost and all the
[23:40] things that the early church stood for
[23:42] and the Catholic church has none of
[23:45] them so they placed the crucifix here it
[23:50] was brought that was hued out of Olive
[23:53] Tree under where Jesus prayed that's a
[23:57] crucifix Tak years and was given to me
[23:59] by brother arganbright and I want to
[24:02] dedicate it with this church and how
[24:05] appropriate that every who hung it there
[24:08] I don't know who it was and hang it here
[24:10] to my to my
[24:14] left he pardoned the thief to his right
[24:19] that's
[24:21] me and another thing it represents as
[24:25] his head is bowed as you see is
[24:27] suffering
[24:29] any persons who are is looking over the
[24:33] Altar and he's expecting you he
[24:38] sinner he'll be looking down upon
[24:41] you later they'll have a little light
[24:43] sitting here that when the alar call is
[24:46] being made a light will flash on to that
[24:49] that when people are here to you say why
[24:51] do you need that you shouldn't have an
[24:53] image well then the same God that said
[24:56] don't make yourself any in images the
[24:59] same God said build two chons and tip
[25:02] their wings together and put them at the
[25:03] mercy seat where the People Prayed you
[25:07] see it's it's without
[25:09] understanding
[25:11] so that is inspired and directly hung in
[25:17] its right place and I'm so thankful to
[25:20] be the one at the right
[25:22] side I trust that he has forgiven me for
[25:27] I as far as literally stealing anything
[25:29] as I know I never did in my life but
[25:33] I've so misused this time till it stole
[25:36] that way and I done many things that I
[25:38] shouldn't do and I'm grateful to God
[25:40] this morning that he has forgiven my
[25:42] sins and now I want to read out of the
[25:45] book of 1 Chronicles 17 and just speak
[25:49] for about five minutes on dedicational
[25:53] service pray and then we're going into
[25:56] the message
[25:59] now in first
[26:02] Chronicles the the 17th
[26:08] chapter night came to pass as David set
[26:12] in the
[26:14] house that David said to Nathan the
[26:18] prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedar
[26:23] but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[26:27] remaineth under curse
[26:31] then Nathan said unto David do all that
[26:35] is in thine heart for God is with
[26:39] thee and it came to pass the same night
[26:43] that the word of the Lord came to Nathan
[26:46] saying go and tell my servant
[26:50] David go and tell David my servant
[26:53] brother thus sayeth the Lord Thou shalt
[26:56] not build me a house to dwell in for I
[27:00] have not dwelt in a house since the day
[27:03] that I brought up Israel until this day
[27:06] but have gone from tent to tent and from
[27:10] one Tabernacle to another whereas I have
[27:14] walked with all Israel spake i a word to
[27:18] any of the judges of Israel whom I
[27:21] commanded to Feed My People saying why
[27:24] have you not built me a
[27:25] house now therefore thus sh shalt thou
[27:30] say unto
[27:31] David thus sayith the Lord of hosts I
[27:34] took thee from the Sheep coat even from
[27:38] falling the sheep that thou should us be
[27:42] ruler Over My People Israel and I have
[27:45] been with thee wh soever thou has walked
[27:50] and have cut off thine enemies from
[27:53] before thee and have made thee a name
[27:56] like the name of great man that are in
[27:58] the
[28:02] earth I would like to
[28:05] say at this place
[28:09] that that David saw the same thing that
[28:15] we
[28:17] saw David said it is not
[28:21] right that you people have built me a
[28:24] house of
[28:26] Cedar and the Ark of the the Covenant of
[28:29] my God is still under curtains that was
[28:34] skins that have been solded together of
[28:37] sheep and
[28:38] animals he said it isn't right for me to
[28:42] have a nice home and the Ark of the
[28:45] Covenant of my God remaining in a tent
[28:49] so God put upon his heart to build a
[28:54] tabernacle but David being a man
[28:58] of of love and consecration to God yet
[29:02] he had shed too much blood so he said
[29:07] David speaking this in the presence of
[29:10] the prophet of that age which was Nathan
[29:15] and Nathan knowing that God loved David
[29:18] he said David do all that's in your
[29:21] heart for God is with
[29:26] thee what a statement
[29:28] do all that's in your heart for God is
[29:31] with you and that same night showing the
[29:37] consecration of David to the love of God
[29:42] and then to see the same night knowing
[29:46] that he was in the era that he was not
[29:50] permitted to do it God was graceful
[29:52] enough to come down and speak to
[29:56] Nathan I always like these
[29:58] words go tell Nathan my go tell David my
[30:05] servant that I took you from the Sheep
[30:09] coat just you wasn't
[30:13] nothing I I'd like to apply that here
[30:16] just a
[30:18] minute I took you from
[30:22] nothing and I I I give you a name you
[30:26] got a name like great name that's in the
[30:30] earth and I'd like to apply that in a in
[30:34] a
[30:35] confidential yet in a a way of making a
[30:41] point I was
[30:43] thinking that a few years ago I standing
[30:46] down in the city here and nobody cared
[30:50] for me nobody loved me I love people but
[30:55] nobody loved me because of the
[30:58] background of the
[31:00] family no disregards to my precious
[31:04] mother and father how I wish that Mama
[31:08] could have lived to walked in this
[31:10] Sanctuary this
[31:12] morning many of the oldtimers who plac
[31:15] their money to help build it
[31:18] here maybe God this morning let look
[31:21] over the
[31:25] banister but the family of brandom
[31:28] didn't have a very good name around here
[31:31] on account of
[31:33] drinking nobody had nothing to do with
[31:36] me I remember telling my wife not long
[31:39] ago just remember that I I couldn't get
[31:42] anyone to talk to me nobody cared for me
[31:46] and now I have to hide to get a little
[31:49] rest and now the Lord has give us this
[31:53] great place and and these great things
[31:55] that he's done and
[31:58] he give me
[32:01] a besid a bad name he give me a
[32:09] name liken to some of the Great
[32:13] Men and he's cut off my enemies wherever
[32:16] I
[32:17] went never been nothing standing
[32:21] before wherever it
[32:24] went but
[32:28] and how grateful I am for that and how
[32:32] would I ever
[32:34] know as a little ragged
[32:38] kid up here two or three blocks in her
[32:42] to the iner bille
[32:44] school one I was a laughing stock of the
[32:47] school from being so
[32:51] ragged skate on an Old
[32:55] Pond how did I ever know know that down
[32:59] beneath that pond laid the
[33:02] seed of a Lily that could bloom like
[33:08] this and how do I ever know that no one
[33:13] talking to me and yet he would give me a
[33:16] a name that would be honored amongst his
[33:24] people and
[33:26] now they David was not permitted to
[33:29] build a temple he could not do
[33:33] it but he said I'll raise up from your
[33:39] seed and he will build the
[33:43] temple and that Temple will be an
[33:47] everlasting
[33:49] Temple and upon your
[33:52] son the son of David will be an
[33:55] everlasting Kingdom he'll control
[34:01] Solomon David's son in the natural from
[34:04] his natural strength built a house unto
[34:08] the Lord a
[34:10] temple but when the real seed of David
[34:14] come the son of
[34:17] David he told him there would come a
[34:19] time that there wouldn't be one stone
[34:22] left upon the other of that
[34:25] Temple but he tried to Point them to
[34:28] another
[34:31] Temple John the Revelator over in the
[34:34] Book of
[34:36] Revelations he saw this Tabernacle
[34:39] Revelations
[34:41] 21 he saw the new Temple coming
[34:44] descending down from
[34:46] heaven adored as a bride was adored for
[34:51] her
[34:52] husband and a voice out of the temple
[34:55] said behold the
[34:58] Tabernacle of God is with
[35:03] man and God shall be with them and
[35:07] they'll wipe all tears from their eyes
[35:09] and there shall be no more hunger and no
[35:11] more sorrow no more pain or
[35:15] death for the former things have passed
[35:19] away then the
[35:21] true son of David as we're going to see
[35:25] in this lessons coming on in this week
[35:29] well then come to his
[35:32] Temple the temple of God the real
[35:37] Tabernacle which he has gone away to
[35:40] construct
[35:41] now for he said in John 14 in my
[35:45] father's house are many mansions and I
[35:49] will go what did he mean by that is
[35:52] already for
[35:54] ordained and I'll go to prepare a place
[35:59] for you and will return back to receive
[36:02] you to
[36:04] myself and of course we know that'll be
[36:06] in the
[36:07] great age to
[36:10] come and the true seed of David will
[36:13] take the throne which is Jesus Christ
[36:16] and there will reign over the church as
[36:20] his bride in the house with him and over
[36:23] the 12 tribes of Israel throughout all
[36:26] eternity
[36:28] amen and these little
[36:31] places as David could not build the true
[36:36] Tabernacle of
[36:38] God because he
[36:41] wasn't prepared to do it there was
[36:44] nothing he could do he was a Marl and
[36:47] shed
[36:49] blood so is it today to us we are not
[36:54] prepared to build the true Tabernacle of
[36:57] God
[36:58] there's only one can do that and it's
[37:00] being in its construction now but this
[37:04] little
[37:05] Tabernacle along with the temple it's
[37:07] Solomon building and along with the
[37:10] others are only temporarily places of
[37:15] worship until the time comes when the
[37:18] real Tabernacle will be set up upon the
[37:20] Earth and righteousness shall rain from
[37:23] Sky to Sky and there will be no more
[37:26] sorrow there will be no funerals
[37:28] preached in that
[37:30] Tabernacle there'll be no more weddings
[37:33] for the wedding will be one great
[37:35] wedding for
[37:37] eternity what a time that will be but
[37:40] let us purpose in our heart
[37:43] today that in commemoration and waiting
[37:47] for that Tabernacle to come that we will
[37:50] so characterize ourself by his spirit
[37:54] that we will worship in this place as if
[37:58] we were in that other place waiting for
[38:00] that place to come now let us stand to
[38:04] our
[38:17] feet and as I read the Holy
[38:26] script I saw new heavens and a new
[38:29] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[38:32] Earth was passed away and there were no
[38:34] more seed I John saw the holy city of
[38:37] the New
[38:38] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[38:40] Heaven prepared as a bride adored for a
[38:43] husband and I heard the voice out of
[38:46] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[38:50] God is with
[38:51] man and he shall dwell with them and
[38:55] they shall be his people and God himself
[38:57] self shall be with them and be their
[39:02] God let us bow our heads
[39:06] now our heavenly
[39:10] father we stand in
[39:15] awe we stand in
[39:18] respect and in holy
[39:23] reverence and we ask you Lord to accept
[39:28] our
[39:30] gift that you've given us
[39:33] Grace
[39:34] money to prepare for a worship place for
[39:40] you there's nothing or no place that we
[39:44] could prepare upon the Earth that would
[39:47] be worthy for the the spirit of God to
[39:51] dwell in but we offer this to you as a
[39:56] token of of our
[39:58] love and feelings toward you
[40:02] Lord and we thank you for all the things
[40:06] that you have done for us and now the
[40:10] building and the grounds being dedicated
[40:13] long ago to the service and we thank you
[40:16] for
[40:18] memories of what has

[41:29] respect of God and may the gospel so
[41:33] flow from this place tell it will cause
[41:37] the
[41:39] world to come from the four corners of
[41:44] the globe to see the glory of God going

[1:49:24] we've dedicated this place as a place of
[1:49:29] worship a place that we come to hear
[1:49:32] from
[1:49:33] you not to talk father but to
[1:49:37] listen to bring our thanksgivings and
[1:49:40] our
[1:49:42] requests but father above all that we
[1:49:45] ask we want you to know that you're
[1:49:48] worthy you're the King of Kings you're
[1:49:51] the Lord of lords
[1:49:53] we praise you as
[1:49:55] Creator and maker of all heavens and

[1:50:00] made by you and nothing that was made
[1:50:04] father there's nothing that's made that
[1:50:06] was not made of
[1:50:08] you you are Lord You Are God we have not
[1:50:12] words to describe your majesty and your
[1:50:16] glory but we praise you this morning
[1:50:19] Father now we've come that you might
[1:50:21] speak to us
[1:50:23] that you might deal with our hearts
[1:50:25] father that our lives might turn from
[1:50:28] Darkness to light father that we might
[1:50:32] come running to you that the backslider
[1:50:35] might re-examine his position father
[1:50:39] that we may re rededicate it this
[1:50:41] morning we ask you to move in our midst
[1:50:44] and speak to our hearts we ask it in
[1:50:47] jesus' name we pray amen may God bless
[1:50:50] you may be seated
[1:50:56] it's nice to have everybody here with us
[1:50:59] this morning I think they told me that
[1:51:02] we ended up with a little over 400
[1:51:06] people here this morning and that's a
[1:51:09] nice crowd uh this evening we'll have
[1:51:11] communion with the
[1:51:13] Believers uh at Communion now that's
[1:51:15] when the real Church comes out you have
[1:51:18] the Sunday church and then you have the
[1:51:20] real church and uh you know there's a
[1:51:23] lot of things that you know brother brah
[1:51:25] said that uh uh he was one of those guys
[1:51:28] that can sit down and and well I'm one
[1:51:30] of those preachers that
[1:51:32] can say what we need you know what I
[1:51:35] mean so I we're not trying to win
[1:51:38] friends but we're trying to serve God
[1:51:42] Amen and so we we we just encourage you
[1:51:45] another thing I'd like to encourage
[1:51:47] everybody to
[1:51:49] do is I'd like you to treat Church like
[1:51:53] work how many comes late to work a half
[1:51:56] hour and 45 minutes
[1:51:59] late you know I really think it it's a
[1:52:02] tremendous insult to the Lord that we
[1:52:08] make it the church our work on time to
[1:52:11] get something that's
[1:52:12] carnal and yet we roll into the house of
[1:52:16] God 35 45 minutes late and expect his
[1:52:20] Spirit to move
[1:52:24] amen so I want to say that because I I I
[1:52:29] want to share with you this morning what
[1:52:34] I stand for and what it is that I preach
[1:52:39] from this
[1:52:40] pulpit and and I'm not perfect you know
[1:52:45] I'm
[1:52:46] late occasionally myself in fact brother
[1:52:49] brm said that he was always
[1:52:52] they said that they called him the late
[1:52:55] William Brandon but that was because he
[1:52:57] was about God's business you know have
[1:53:00] an interview or have a vision or be
[1:53:04] praying for somebody you know about
[1:53:06] God's business sometimes I I I wonder
[1:53:10] what it is that we hold
[1:53:13] dearest you know what our priority is
[1:53:16] and what it is that we we hold dear to
[1:53:20] ourselves and I think that reflects a
[1:53:22] lot sometimes and so try to police
[1:53:26] everything as we heard brother brm said
[1:53:28] they're the
[1:53:29] policemen uh of the church and it it's
[1:53:34] very difficult for them uh when
[1:53:37] everybody's comes late and comes pouring
[1:53:40] in late and of course many of you that
[1:53:43] know me I don't believe in
[1:53:46] culture you know what I believe I don't
[1:53:48] I don't believe there's cultures that
[1:53:50] allow anybody to break the word of God I
[1:53:55] I I'm a I'm a firm believer of that that
[1:53:58] culture's taught right and the reason
[1:54:01] people are late because they're taught
[1:54:03] to be late you know the reason people
[1:54:06] don't work is because they're taught not
[1:54:08] to work you know they were're taught
[1:54:11] those things but we're not here today
[1:54:14] we're here to only for one purpose and
[1:54:16] that is to be taught by the word of
[1:54:19] God this is our our our preeminence this
[1:54:24] is what everything is we stand for and
[1:54:28] I'm I'm trying to look out you know
[1:54:30] there's always certain people I look for
[1:54:32] so and my congregation's kind of moved
[1:54:35] all over the place so uh you know I'm
[1:54:38] trying to find many of you and U to
[1:54:42] fellowship with you but um the prophet
[1:54:46] of God made a statement he said when the
[1:54:48] church is in order and everybody comes
[1:54:51] in and they're praying
[1:54:53] and they they've came in and they've
[1:54:55] read their Bible he says and the
[1:54:57] minister comes out he says God's fixing
[1:55:00] the move and so it's real important so
[1:55:04] uh that's why I I I'm saying that's
[1:55:07] important to uh come into your posted
[1:55:11] Duty and be there that God could really
[1:55:14] do something and and it's like anything
[1:55:17] that's new there's all kinds of little
[1:55:21] um what do they call that that word
[1:55:23] tweaking is that a correct word where
[1:55:26] you you have to adjust this a little and
[1:55:28] adjust that a little and pretty soon
[1:55:31] we'll get it all together uh We've
[1:55:33] started now to uh work on our fellowship
[1:55:37] hall next St so until that's ready uh
[1:55:41] we're going to use it for foot washing
[1:55:43] for the Sisters but uh we just advise
[1:55:45] everybody just to probably stay out of
[1:55:47] that part of the church if you could and
[1:55:51] and and do the best you can to uh adhere
[1:55:55] to the things that our Prophet told us
[1:55:57] this morning Amen Let Us stand this
[1:56:00] morning
[1:56:01] we let's turn in our
[1:56:06] bibles if we could
[1:56:09] to the gospel of St
[1:56:16] John in the first chapter and the first
[1:56:20] verse
[1:56:22] and we'll read a couple of verses here
[1:56:25] this
[1:56:31] morning and it says in the beginning was
[1:56:34] the
[1:56:35] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:56:39] Word was God Amen and the same was in
[1:56:43] the beginning with God all things were
[1:56:48] made by him all things were made by the
[1:56:51] word word yes nothing came into
[1:56:54] existence until it was
[1:56:57] spoken all things were made by him and
[1:57:00] without him was not anything made that
[1:57:04] was
[1:57:05] made and in him was
[1:57:08] life and the life was in and and the
[1:57:13] life was the light of men and the light
[1:57:18] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[1:57:22] comprehended it not Heavenly Father we
[1:57:26] ask you to bless your word your precious
[1:57:28] name we pray amen God bless
[1:57:36] you we certainly uh welcome any visitors
[1:57:40] and those of you that have come this
[1:57:41] morning to share our first service with
[1:57:45] us when we were reading and listening
[1:57:49] this morning there was a statement that
[1:57:52] made that kind of uh stood out to me uh
[1:57:57] especially and I I will read it to you
[1:58:01] uh he says let's dedicate this to
[1:58:06] God this is his meeting place where we
[1:58:11] meet with
[1:58:13] him now this is a statement that struck
[1:58:17] me and the law goes forth from the
[1:58:21] sanctuary
[1:58:22] of course and I believe that that would
[1:58:27] be pleasing to our heavenly
[1:58:31] father and he made that statement and I
[1:58:35] I I it struck my heart in a different
[1:58:38] way because we have such a uh certain
[1:58:43] ideas in our mind of what words mean and
[1:58:46] of what uh
[1:58:49] uh we categorize things if I could say
[1:58:52] it that way and so a lot of times when
[1:58:55] we hear the word law the prophet of God
[1:58:58] says the law goes forth from here so the
[1:59:02] law of God goes forth from the pulpit
[1:59:06] from the word of God he says this is
[1:59:08] where we come to meet him and this is
[1:59:10] where the law Goes Forth but a lot of
[1:59:13] times in our heart we think the law
[1:59:16] automatically means uh that it's a set
[1:59:20] of rules
[1:59:22] or it it it's the Old Testament it it
[1:59:26] it's uh the way that they used to
[1:59:28] worship and it was the things they used
[1:59:30] to do the washing of hands the uh the
[1:59:34] not working on the Sabbath all the
[1:59:36] different ways that they dressed in
[1:59:38] everything and so the minute we we hear
[1:59:41] the word law we think oh something that
[1:59:46] is a uh uh put upon us you know and we
[1:59:50] talk about it in the scripture the law
[1:59:53] of sin and death and that man didn't
[1:59:55] know what sin was until the law came and
[2:00:00] and so our our thinking is of the law is
[2:00:04] Thou shalt not Thou shalt not commit
[2:00:06] adultery a man didn't know he could run
[2:00:09] after Maybe by his nature he would go
[2:00:12] and maybe uh run uh and freely but then
[2:00:16] the law came and said if you're married
[2:00:19] then you don't do these things outside
[2:00:21] the holy Covenant of marriage you don't
[2:00:23] commit adultery now to break that law to
[2:00:27] him then became
[2:00:28] sin you know a lot of people maybe they
[2:00:32] would find something on the road or they
[2:00:35] would find something or they saw
[2:00:38] something that they felt that they
[2:00:39] needed and somebody else didn't need and
[2:00:43] so they would go take it from them and
[2:00:45] they could say okay and they didn't they
[2:00:49] didn't know they every man lived un
[2:00:51] himself self according to his own
[2:00:54] measure according to his own
[2:00:57] righteousness and so I might take
[2:00:59] something and I didn't know that was
[2:01:01] wrong until the law came and said Thou
[2:01:03] shalt not
[2:01:04] steal and then you and maybe you wanted
[2:01:08] what somebody else had and then the law
[2:01:10] come and says Thou shalt not
[2:01:12] covet you know so the law began to
[2:01:15] govern so there there was a the law of
[2:01:19] sin and death is the law law that
[2:01:22] governed sin so the law governed sin it
[2:01:26] kept man's actions into a place that he
[2:01:31] wouldn't sin so the law of sin and death
[2:01:35] that law of God was uh the the law of
[2:01:39] sin or the law of death it it governed
[2:01:43] the sinful nature of Man by law and and
[2:01:47] that was necessary but there's another
[2:01:50] law and I would just if I could uh just
[2:01:54] share with you this morning maybe uh
[2:01:57] from my own thinking uh there's another
[2:02:02] law that goes forth and and there's the
[2:02:05] law of the word and you say well what's
[2:02:09] the law of the word well the law of the
[2:02:11] word is it never fails and it never
[2:02:14] changes that's a law that it never that
[2:02:18] that's something that you can live by
[2:02:21] and that's how we stay in order in
[2:02:24] society as we live by laws and rules and
[2:02:27] we know those laws and rules and
[2:02:30] therefore we know what to expect and and
[2:02:33] then we have people that that uh uh
[2:02:36] police those laws and rules and if
[2:02:39] someone is Breaking the Rules and
[2:02:41] Breaking the laws and then we apprehend
[2:02:44] that person and and uh we try to end the
[2:02:49] disruption and uh and so we have a
[2:02:53] disruptor as Christians how many knows
[2:02:55] who our disruptor is it's the devil you
[2:02:58] know that's all he wants to do is
[2:03:00] disrupt the order of
[2:03:03] God and disrupt the word of God that's
[2:03:06] what he does that's the whole thing that
[2:03:08] Satan wants to do is he wants to
[2:03:10] discredit the word of God he wants to
[2:03:13] make the word of God of none effect he
[2:03:17] doesn't want all of us to ever come to
[2:03:19] the realization that the word is
[2:03:22] unchanging and it's always true there's
[2:03:25] one thing you can count on is you can
[2:03:28] count on the word of God yeah if you
[2:03:30] read it 50 years from now it'll say the
[2:03:33] same thing if you if the people that
[2:03:35] were reading it a hundred years ago we
[2:03:38] reading the same thing so it doesn't
[2:03:41] change and God doesn't change he doesn't
[2:03:43] change so we know that that's a the a
[2:03:48] law a law of God that he's an un
[2:03:51] changing God if he ever does one thing
[2:03:54] one way he'll continue to do it the same
[2:03:57] way every time you can count on that
[2:04:01] that's why testimony is so important for
[2:04:04] a Believer is
[2:04:06] because it allows them to hear what God
[2:04:09] did for somebody and then that person
[2:04:12] can say if that person did that if God
[2:04:14] did that for them he can do that for me
[2:04:17] because he's the same and when that
[2:04:20] person says I I read This Promise in the
[2:04:22] word of God and I stood on this promise
[2:04:25] and I believed this promise and that
[2:04:28] promise comes to pass you can sit back
[2:04:30] and know that there's hope in the camp
[2:04:33] there's life in the camp because there's
[2:04:35] the word of the camp and where there's
[2:04:37] word there's life because this is the
[2:04:40] light of men and it's the life of men
[2:04:43] and the word of God is the life of men
[2:04:47] okay and so we have that law so what
[2:04:50] goes forth from the house of God is the
[2:04:53] law but it's not the Ten Commandments
[2:04:56] law it's not the law of that the
[2:04:58] children of Israel lived under it's the
[2:05:01] Gentile law of Grace and that law is
[2:05:04] that we have the word we have an
[2:05:09] unfailing promise that God keeps his
[2:05:12] word and if we live by that word and we
[2:05:15] walk in that word that word promises us
[2:05:19] it will produce word and so we can rest
[2:05:23] there it's a resting place for the
[2:05:25] believer that it it doesn't change with
[2:05:28] time it it doesn't change with morals it
[2:05:32] it as the World falls apart the believer
[2:05:35] doesn't have to fall apart in fact
[2:05:37] that's a time that the believer needs to
[2:05:39] take the word of God and cling to it
[2:05:42] ever so
[2:05:43] more because it's the the word of God
[2:05:48] and so that's a
[2:05:49] law that is brought forth and there's
[2:05:54] another law that we've been talking on
[2:05:56] the law of the
[2:05:57] seed but and we we know the law of the
[2:06:02] seed so when God created heaven and
[2:06:06] earth and he said let there be he
[2:06:09] created it by his word the heavens and
[2:06:12] earth were framed by the word of God so
[2:06:15] there was nothing in the beginning but
[2:06:18] God God had thoughts and then God
[2:06:20] expressed those thoughts and he said let
[2:06:22] there be light and there
[2:06:25] was nobody knew what light was if we
[2:06:28] were on the other side of
[2:06:30] it this is part of the law of the word
[2:06:34] that God is his own
[2:06:37] interpreter he interprets the word so if
[2:06:40] I said let there be
[2:06:43] light well you wouldn't know what I was
[2:06:47] talking about or what light was until
[2:06:51] light appear That's right so for example
[2:06:53] if you have never seen a piano or you
[2:06:56] had never seen an organ you you have no
[2:06:58] idea in fact that word hadn't even
[2:07:01] registered in your mind that you could
[2:07:03] make an
[2:07:06] association and I said let there be a
[2:07:09] piano and organ well you would have to
[2:07:12] sit
[2:07:13] back and wait for what that I spoke to
[2:07:18] materialize and manifest before before
[2:07:22] you could make the interpretation and
[2:07:25] have the revelation of what it is the
[2:07:28] trouble with men is God says something
[2:07:31] and then they all start piping in their
[2:07:33] two
[2:07:35] cents this is what I think an organ is
[2:07:38] and we got one guy walking around here
[2:07:40] saying organ organ piano piano another
[2:07:44] guy's going piano piano piano but God's
[2:07:48] his own interpreter and God chose to
[2:07:51] reveal his word by
[2:07:57] Revelation and that's the law right I
[2:08:00] can't change that a group of men can't
[2:08:03] get together and come up with a
[2:08:05] definition and say we will decide it
[2:08:08] means this or we will decide it will
[2:08:10] mean this or I think this is what the
[2:08:13] people can understand let me tell you a
[2:08:15] child can understand the word of
[2:08:18] God the word of God doesn't change God
[2:08:21] reveals the word of God and God
[2:08:24] interprets his word by bringing it to
[2:08:27] pass that is a
[2:08:30] law that is the law that we want to
[2:08:34] preach from this Pulpit is the law of
[2:08:37] God the law of the word of God the law
[2:08:41] of the seed of God is that everything is
[2:08:44] going to bring forth of its own kind
[2:08:47] when he created the TR trees he said let
[2:08:49] there be trees Let There Be fruit and
[2:08:51] let the seed be in
[2:08:54] it he had a way that he was going to
[2:08:58] bring things to pass or bring things
[2:09:01] into
[2:09:02] existence so he spoke
[2:09:06] them into
[2:09:08] existence and after he spoke them into
[2:09:11] existence the way that they were going
[2:09:12] to procreate themselves or
[2:09:16] continue was by
[2:09:18] seed the apple tree drops its seed into
[2:09:22] the ground the every thing I don't know
[2:09:26] all the different ways that it comes
[2:09:29] forth but we've all come forth by seed
[2:09:32] by the plan of God by the plan of M so
[2:09:35] we know that there's a law of the seed
[2:09:37] and that seed is that everything brings
[2:09:39] forth of its own kind lies don't breed
[2:09:45] truth lies breed more lies lies produces
[2:09:50] lies you might Dress It Up up a little
[2:09:51] bit and make it look pretty and and and
[2:09:56] put a tuxedo on it and a top hat on it
[2:09:59] and give it a a a set of spats and you
[2:10:04] might say it but it's a lie nonetheless
[2:10:06] and the reason it was a lie because it
[2:10:09] come from the lie and Satan is a liar
[2:10:12] he's the father of all lies and there's
[2:10:15] no truth in them and anything that's
[2:10:18] contrary to the word of God is of the
[2:10:20] devil
[2:10:23] I don't care if you put a robe on it I
[2:10:25] don't care if you uh put a crown on it I
[2:10:28] don't care if you wrap a church around
[2:10:29] it I don't care if you wrap music around
[2:10:32] it I don't care how that you present it
[2:10:34] you can put a religious covering on it
[2:10:37] but if it's not the word of God is still
[2:10:39] the
[2:10:41] lie that's the law of the seed that will
[2:10:44] come forth of its own kind it'll produce
[2:10:47] its own kind it it'll it'll come out it
[2:10:50] and we also know that within the law of
[2:10:53] the seed is the law of reaping and
[2:10:56] sewing so all these things are laws that
[2:11:00] come forth because the law of God comes
[2:11:02] forth from the house of
[2:11:04] God that's what our M was trying to tell
[2:11:07] us that's what our messenger was trying
[2:11:10] to tell the church ages that you just
[2:11:12] can't go make your own religion and
[2:11:15] think you're going to get to heaven
[2:11:17] you've got to come God's provided way
[2:11:21] there's no way around that so it
[2:11:23] behooves us to examine ourselves and
[2:11:27] find out what law that we're living on
[2:11:30] are we living under the law of
[2:11:32] self-righteousness are we living under
[2:11:34] the law of our own conclusions are we
[2:11:36] living under the law of our own
[2:11:41] intelligence a man told me one time I'm
[2:11:43] going to examine the message and see if
[2:11:45] it's
[2:11:48] right I said God the law of God is that
[2:11:51] I I'll build my church upon
[2:11:54] Revelation not
[2:11:56] conclusion not
[2:11:59] education when you get a revelation from
[2:12:02] God be true to
[2:12:04] it if you're true to it and there's air
[2:12:07] in it God will correct correct the air
[2:12:10] by the
[2:12:13] word he'll not let you go astray if your
[2:12:16] heart is
[2:12:19] pure so we we know that that's a law and
[2:12:22] we've been talking on the law of the Sea
[2:12:24] The Law of the sea and again this
[2:12:26] morning I I'm explaining to you where I
[2:12:29] stand in the gospel what my vision is
[2:12:32] what it is that I preach and why that I
[2:12:36] preach it I want you to have a full
[2:12:39] understanding a full disclosure to you
[2:12:41] why that I play
[2:12:43] tapes why that I do the things you ought
[2:12:46] to know you have a right to know those
[2:12:49] of you that support the ministry and
[2:12:51] those of you that put your money into
[2:12:54] building this building as our messenger
[2:12:56] mentioned he he said you have a right to
[2:12:59] know what is it that brother McGary
[2:13:04] believes what's the the
[2:13:07] core
[2:13:08] heart of what he stands for and how he
[2:13:12] thinks and what he believes and why he
[2:13:15] goes the direction that he goes and I'm
[2:13:19] going to be honest with you this morning
[2:13:22] okay and share it why so there there's a
[2:13:27] a a law of revelation we find it in Amos
[2:13:31] 3 and 7 and I'm putting these laws
[2:13:34] together to give just a little moment
[2:13:38] before I share with you my heart and
[2:13:41] this is a law that I sincerely believe
[2:13:43] for I'll do
[2:13:45] nothing unless I reveal it to my
[2:13:47] servants the
[2:13:50] prophet That's the Law of
[2:13:53] Revelation that's how God chose to get a
[2:13:56] message to his
[2:13:58] people that he would reveal that
[2:14:01] prophets spoke to God lip to
[2:14:05] ear that's how they spoke to God God
[2:14:09] spoke to them and then they
[2:14:13] spoke and and
[2:14:16] so in understanding those laws
[2:14:22] I and I'm not here to speak of myself
[2:14:26] this morning but I I I I want to share
[2:14:29] my heart with you
[2:14:34] of what I think and where I think that
[2:14:38] we
[2:14:39] are as a
[2:14:41] people and where I think that we are in
[2:14:46] the plan of
[2:14:47] God and uh you are entitled
[2:14:51] to
[2:14:53] completely different
[2:14:55] viewpoints there's many people that
[2:14:58] believe that we're on the midst of a a
[2:15:02] great
[2:15:03] Revival I don't believe
[2:15:07] that okay I don't believe there's a
[2:15:10] great big gigantic
[2:15:12] Revival coming to the church our
[2:15:15] messenger told us the Revival's
[2:15:18] over so we're not looking for what swept
[2:15:22] this country in the 30s 40s 50s and
[2:15:27] through the 60s because there came a
[2:15:29] time when this country rejected the word
[2:15:32] of God and he said that on every corner
[2:15:35] they're crying Revival Revival God's
[2:15:38] going to send a Revival God's going to
[2:15:40] raise up this nation oh that just re
[2:15:44] reminds me when and the the Prophet come
[2:15:47] him up mik he says oh take these horns
[2:15:50] and go out and drive him from the land
[2:15:53] and he said isn't there one other yeah
[2:15:56] but that guy we don't want to hear for
[2:15:58] him he said I saw Israel scattered his
[2:16:01] sheep you know and because he'd
[2:16:04] prophesied so how's there going to be
[2:16:06] Revival when the seventh CH age
[2:16:09] messenger said it was over that America
[2:16:12] had their
[2:16:15] Revival but most people thinks the
[2:16:17] Revival is going back to G
[2:16:23] glic I don't want to go
[2:16:27] there so
[2:16:29] we're we're not looking for that but we
[2:16:33] are looking for something yes sir that I
[2:16:37] think it's the
[2:16:38] greatest
[2:16:40] opportunity that man has ever
[2:16:44] had and I'd like to
[2:16:47] illustrate that in my own little way to
[2:16:52] morning and have you place
[2:16:56] yourself within this
[2:16:59] illustration so we know that God has a
[2:17:03] word and when God speaks his word it
[2:17:07] will come to
[2:17:09] pass law of the word right it will not
[2:17:13] fail it will come to pass we also know
[2:17:17] that God never speaks anything unless he
[2:17:20] has an intention and a reason for doing
[2:17:24] it there's no vain
[2:17:27] words in the gospel there's no vain
[2:17:31] sentences in the message of the hour
[2:17:34] there's no vain stories you might think
[2:17:37] well those are corny stories they're not
[2:17:38] corny for somebody that's laying on
[2:17:40] their
[2:17:41] deathbed they're not corny for someone
[2:17:44] that's so desperate they can't find a
[2:17:46] way out there's they're not corny to
[2:17:49] somebody that doesn't even uh is so far
[2:17:53] away from religion and association with
[2:17:56] preachers that they have no hope yet God
[2:17:59] knows what he's doing every word was
[2:18:02] spoken just for a reason and for a
[2:18:05] purpose you can count on
[2:18:07] that there's and and the the wonderful
[2:18:12] part about the word of God is you take
[2:18:14] the whole of it you don't take part of
[2:18:17] it man doesn't live by bread alone but
[2:18:21] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[2:18:27] mouth of God so that that's what we live
[2:18:31] by so when God spoke his word he put it
[2:18:34] in seed form and we know that he said
[2:18:38] that he that maybe some will plant it
[2:18:40] and water it he says but that he would
[2:18:42] plant it he would water it and he would
[2:18:45] raise it up by his Spirit sayith the
[2:18:48] Lord so we know that God
[2:18:52] it had planted a seed and not only did
[2:18:54] he plant a seed in the natural sense he
[2:18:57] planted a spiritual seed all of you that
[2:19:00] are here this morning are here because
[2:19:02] there was
[2:19:03] something in you that called you you say
[2:19:07] well I was just invited to hear no you
[2:19:10] receive that invitation because
[2:19:13] something inside of you uh connected you
[2:19:17] might you might dress it up and call it
[2:19:19] curiosity
[2:19:21] uh you might try to put your you know
[2:19:24] your shades on your sunglasses on that
[2:19:28] you might be identified you know oh I
[2:19:30] just come because I was curious no you
[2:19:33] came because there's something inside of
[2:19:35] you that's moving on you cuz God's
[2:19:38] moving and God wants to take you from
[2:19:41] where you are to where that he wants you
[2:19:44] to be that's what God does that's what
[2:19:47] he wants God is not against us God's for
[2:19:49] us amen amen if you're out in sin he
[2:19:52] doesn't want you to live in sin he wants
[2:19:55] you to know the joy and Liberty that we
[2:19:58] have in Christ Jesus he wants you to
[2:20:00] know the the the joy of Salvation and
[2:20:03] and what it means that that that's what
[2:20:05] his heart his heart is toward you he
[2:20:08] loves you his thoughts are good he said
[2:20:10] oh if man could just understand the
[2:20:13] thoughts that I have for them that
[2:20:14] they're good they're Pleasant they're
[2:20:16] they're blessing so God does not want us
[2:20:20] to die in the Trap Of
[2:20:23] Satan and Satan appears as an angel of
[2:20:27] Light Satan comes in a religious garment
[2:20:30] Satan comes spewing lies out of his
[2:20:32] mouth and misinterpreting the word of
[2:20:36] God and no matter how blessed you might
[2:20:39] feel that it is and what a great
[2:20:42] sensation it is God is obligated to his
[2:20:46] word that's the law and God provided it
[2:20:50] away and man can't come up with another
[2:20:54] way to get to God they can't dress it
[2:20:57] better they can't speak it better they
[2:21:00] can't put it together better God's
[2:21:02] provided the way it was his word and he
[2:21:06] provides the way to
[2:21:10] man I don't have a right to change it no
[2:21:13] matter how smart that I think I am I
[2:21:16] don't have a right to go in here and put
[2:21:19] these scriptures together to make it say
[2:21:22] something it doesn't the law of the word
[2:21:24] is God interprets his word and brings it
[2:21:27] to pass but also the law of the Church
[2:21:30] of lady oia is I counsel thee to th eyes
[2:21:33] have that thou might
[2:21:36] see that you might see this word that's
[2:21:40] manifesting and coming to pass in this
[2:21:46] age we're at the end time
[2:21:50] Iraq fire fires missiles at
[2:21:53] Israel you talk about
[2:21:57] unstable you don't know who's going to
[2:21:59] push what
[2:22:04] button it it's it's a time to be
[2:22:11] sincere so knowing these
[2:22:15] laws it's important to see how that God
[2:22:19] works
[2:22:22] and it's it's very obvious right in
[2:22:25] front of
[2:22:27] us our messenger said God hides himself
[2:22:30] in
[2:22:32] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[2:22:37] same so he it's very simple what he
[2:22:43] does it's so simple that it's
[2:22:46] happening right in broad daylight amen
[2:22:50] right before our eyes it's coming to
[2:22:54] pass and if if if we don't have eyes
[2:22:59] Sab that we might
[2:23:02] see in other words we you you put s Sab
[2:23:06] in your eye to clean out all the stuff
[2:23:09] that's blocking your vision to to make
[2:23:12] your eye see clearly to so that you can
[2:23:18] focus so he says I give you eyes have
[2:23:21] that you can get the junk out of your
[2:23:24] eyesight that you can get the confusion
[2:23:26] out of your eyes that that your vision
[2:23:29] might come clear and you might be able
[2:23:31] to see what it is that I'm really
[2:23:36] doing how many wants that I do I I want
[2:23:40] to know what he's
[2:23:43] doing if I could place this in
[2:23:46] here I'll do nothing unless I reveal it
[2:23:49] first to my servant the
[2:23:54] prophet excuse
[2:23:56] me I believe a prophet came in this
[2:23:59] age
[2:24:01] Vindicated proved now you might say
[2:24:04] there's no way that you can't say he
[2:24:06] wasn't a prophet now you can say he was
[2:24:09] a false
[2:24:10] prophet that's
[2:24:12] your own opinion if you would like to do
[2:24:17] that you can't say it wasn't a prophet
[2:24:22] he saw things from behind he saw things
[2:24:26] in the future and he saw things present
[2:24:30] there's only one person I know that's
[2:24:32] omnipresent like that and that's God and
[2:24:36] God does nothing until he reveals it
[2:24:39] first to his servant the
[2:24:42] prophet and we know that this
[2:24:46] messenger came to this
[2:24:49] age there was a certain time in the
[2:24:52] calendar of God it with a certain
[2:24:56] condition and a certain events to take
[2:24:59] place on this Earth that this Prophet
[2:25:02] would arrive in amen I we could go into
[2:25:06] the Book of Revelations and talk about
[2:25:08] the Four Winds and the four corners and
[2:25:10] the angel starting that but
[2:25:13] it it was all in this
[2:25:16] time that this messenger was to arrive
[2:25:20] on the scene and we know the
[2:25:24] biggest signpost or flashing red light
[2:25:28] of the sign of this prophetic coming of
[2:25:32] this
[2:25:33] visitation by the Lord Jesus Christ to
[2:25:36] his church through a prophet messenger
[2:25:39] was the condition of Lady
[2:25:43] oia he says as it was in the days of Lo
[2:25:47] ladyo uh I mean as it was in the days of
[2:25:51] Noah so shall it be in the days of the
[2:25:54] son of man as it was in the days of
[2:25:58] Sodom so we understood that the signpost
[2:26:02] or the flashing red light to the
[2:26:05] believer to catch their attention to
[2:26:08] apply the isav is that when this world
[2:26:12] begin to get in a Sodom condition and I
[2:26:16] hope I don't have to go through the
[2:26:20] that are taking place in our country
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:25] now to let you know you're in a Sodom
[2:26:29] condition but that isn't for us to have
[2:26:32] an agreement oh we're all in a it's for
[2:26:35] us individually to consider our position
[2:26:40] in the kingdom of God at the time and
[2:26:43] moment that we're
[2:26:47] in that's what we got to con consider
[2:26:51] I know what it's like to be a teenager
[2:26:53] and run with your buddies and uh you
[2:26:56] know the hot rod down the road and to
[2:26:58] drink and to smoke and you know get high
[2:27:01] and listen to music and life's just a
[2:27:03] whirlwind you know the wages of sin is
[2:27:06] death but God's got a gift for you and
[2:27:09] is eternal
[2:27:14] life and you don't want to walk away
[2:27:16] from that
[2:27:20] I imagine there's people right in here
[2:27:22] that could testify this morning that God
[2:27:24] dealt with their heart they're walked
[2:27:26] away and now they're thankful this
[2:27:27] morning to be
[2:27:30] [Applause]
[2:27:33] alive so
[2:27:35] okay it's and it's an individual
[2:27:41] Affair and I hope this morning that you
[2:27:44] could you will purpose in your
[2:27:46] heart to dedicate your life amen to what
[2:27:50] is going to allow
[2:27:53] you to pass from this realm this corrupt
[2:27:57] realm of this corruptible flesh old
[2:28:01] wrinkling bone aing
[2:28:04] body that's going to go into the ground
[2:28:07] and step over into an eternal body one
[2:28:12] that will live forever cu the gift of
[2:28:15] God's eternal life
[2:28:18] Hallelujah I want to do that I want to
[2:28:20] make that
[2:28:21] transition I I want to come to that
[2:28:24] place that I can be raptured that I can
[2:28:28] be translated and may I use another word
[2:28:31] in relation to the seed that I could be
[2:28:37] harvested cuz we know that the seed is
[2:28:40] harvested when it's mature and when it's
[2:28:46] ripened and I'm going close now in the
[2:28:50] next few moments
[2:28:53] to with what that I want to speak and I
[2:29:00] I would like to use my favorite
[2:29:03] prop uh
[2:29:13] Beno been w i i commission you to stand
[2:29:16] right there and now you're a prophet
[2:29:20] okay all right
[2:29:23] so I know Beno doesn't look
[2:29:27] like this person on the outside but I'm
[2:29:31] wanting him to look like that person on
[2:29:34] the
[2:29:37] inside okay but this is
[2:29:39] for our
[2:29:44] illustration brother Brenham had a seed
[2:29:47] in
[2:29:49] him he had to have a seed in him because
[2:29:53] of the law of
[2:29:56] seed you say well he was a prophet he
[2:29:59] was born to prophet he had all the
[2:30:01] characteristics of a prophet but yet
[2:30:05] that seed had to be
[2:30:09] brought to a certain
[2:30:12] place first of all he had to get his
[2:30:16] attention how many know the price that
[2:30:18] the prophet of God paid PA for God to
[2:30:21] get his
[2:30:22] intent because of the work he had he
[2:30:26] lost family members he lost wife he was
[2:30:29] at the edge of a fall when he got down
[2:30:32] on his knees he said God if you give me
[2:30:34] a chance to live I'll never disobey you
[2:30:41] again when you think he was breaking up
[2:30:44] about and crying in that
[2:30:48] tape as he thought back to that
[2:30:51] day the price he paid losing his
[2:30:55] daughter losing his
[2:30:58] wife but yet the consolation that God
[2:31:01] gave him by seeing him on the other side
[2:31:05] that's the kind of God we
[2:31:09] serve so here's this little raggy kid we
[2:31:12] talked
[2:31:14] about that ended up having a name
[2:31:17] amongst all the saints of of God
[2:31:20] throughout the world the
[2:31:22] elected the lady of seean age and the
[2:31:25] lady o seean bride knew that this
[2:31:28] Prophet was their angel
[2:31:34] messenger that he was an
[2:31:37] angel sent from God to deliver a message
[2:31:43] to them
[2:31:46] right okay no other voice
[2:31:50] no other way a Onan
[2:31:54] Invasion God could have had a
[2:31:57] committee but God don't do it that way
[2:32:00] he has a law I will do nothing till I
[2:32:03] first reveal it to my servants the
[2:32:06] prophet
[2:32:09] now I've got to take this role in this
[2:32:12] little skit because I'm the
[2:32:16] narrator okay but in this skit I'm the
[2:32:19] word of God
[2:32:24] okay
[2:32:26] now
[2:32:28] here's my Prophet servant William
[2:32:32] brandom that Ben
[2:32:33] represents now I've got a job for him to
[2:32:38] do I've got a message for him to
[2:32:42] deliver because in my mind I knew what
[2:32:45] he was in the beginning
[2:32:51] but yet he's still in which
[2:32:55] form seed
[2:32:57] form so we know that the word of
[2:33:02] God must first come to a
[2:33:06] prophet so
[2:33:09] here's our our
[2:33:12] messenger and the word of God starts
[2:33:15] coming to him it comes to him in a
[2:33:17] burning bush
[2:33:20] it comes to him in a
[2:33:22] shed it come it keeps coming to him in
[2:33:25] different ways what's that word
[2:33:28] doing it's transforming him
[2:33:32] right into what that I had in mind for
[2:33:39] him now there's only one thing that's
[2:33:42] going to transform him and that's what
[2:33:46] the word the word's the only thing that
[2:33:49] can bring him into what it was that was
[2:33:58] spoken right you know many times I say
[2:34:01] this and people just sit back and look
[2:34:03] at me but Jesus was a part of the Bride
[2:34:07] right
[2:34:08] right how else could he be a kinsman
[2:34:11] redeemer the only difference was he
[2:34:14] wasn't born in sin shaped in iniquity
[2:34:17] and he didn't come into the world
[2:34:19] speaking
[2:34:21] lies but yet he was tempted every way
[2:34:24] that we're tempted he was tempted he was
[2:34:28] a man but yet God dwelt in him and even
[2:34:33] he learned obedience by the things he
[2:34:37] suffered I want you to understand God
[2:34:39] can't break his
[2:34:43] line okay so Jesus made this
[2:34:47] statement right I do nothing until the
[2:34:50] father First shows me
[2:34:53] amen okay he was the prophet of all
[2:34:57] prophets he was the prophets that they
[2:35:00] all looked to and he spoke lip to ear
[2:35:04] with the father him and the father were
[2:35:07] one we're a little lower than that I
[2:35:11] know some people don't think they are
[2:35:13] but reality is we're way lower than
[2:35:17] that so as God begin to
[2:35:21] speak and show his prophet and reveal
[2:35:26] things to his Prophet the godhead water
[2:35:30] baptism right remember the vision he he
[2:35:33] wondered about the rain falling on the
[2:35:36] just and the unjust he was going through
[2:35:38] all this and then he he he remembered
[2:35:41] and he saw the back of God and he he he
[2:35:44] saw the things raise up all those things
[2:35:46] that he's sharing with you
[2:35:49] were things that God was sharing with
[2:35:52] him right and the things that God was
[2:35:55] sharing with
[2:35:56] him we're transforming him into what
[2:36:01] that he was going to be I think our
[2:36:03] illustration set now so
[2:36:07] now so now the word of God is
[2:36:13] coming it comes to the prophet can now
[2:36:17] we find out that the there came a time
[2:36:20] he was going to open the seals right
[2:36:24] right we so we have the revelation of
[2:36:25] the godhead the revelation of serpent
[2:36:28] seed all these Revelations were first
[2:36:31] coming to him and transforming him and
[2:36:35] making him into what that he
[2:36:41] was he he didn't bypass the word to do
[2:36:44] it but because of the
[2:36:47] law of the law of
[2:36:51] Revelation that God could do nothing
[2:36:53] unless he revealed it first to his
[2:36:55] servant before he could get it to you he
[2:36:59] had to give it to him right wonder and
[2:37:02] it had to have the same effect on him
[2:37:07] that it would have on
[2:37:11] you else it's not the law of the
[2:37:16] word so you understand so here he is
[2:37:21] he's living his life and God's opening
[2:37:23] him his door here he took him to a camp
[2:37:26] meeting didn't he excuse me to show to
[2:37:29] show uh one guy speaking in tongues and
[2:37:33] another guy and one being honest and one
[2:37:35] being this and and and he was going
[2:37:38] through all those things right and all
[2:37:41] those things were maturing him bringing
[2:37:44] him into the ministry forming him into
[2:37:48] that son of man forming him in to that
[2:37:52] wave offering that first seed that came
[2:37:56] to
[2:37:59] maturity how many understands
[2:38:03] that that by the word yes that was
[2:38:06] brought to
[2:38:08] him it brought him to
[2:38:11] maturity and then that sheep offering
[2:38:15] was waved over the
[2:38:17] people now so the same word that's
[2:38:21] coming to him is now because of the
[2:38:25] law of
[2:38:27] Revelation we're not getting the word
[2:38:33] secondhand and it's not secondhand
[2:38:37] word and it's not manhandled
[2:38:42] word the same word that was spoken to
[2:38:46] him he turned around and spoke it to us
[2:38:52] the same word that brought him to
[2:38:55] maturity is the same word that's to
[2:38:58] bring the bride to maturity it's the
[2:39:02] same word it's the same
[2:39:05] message now when when that flock is that
[2:39:09] that thing in the Harvest in the Wheats
[2:39:12] in the Harvest and he used those things
[2:39:15] for a purpose you know the wind would
[2:39:18] come has anybody ever seen the wind blow
[2:39:20] across a grain field and how it all just
[2:39:23] folds down and pretty soon it looks like
[2:39:26] waves just going across it's a
[2:39:28] magnificent
[2:39:31] sight and the wind would
[2:39:34] come and the rain would come and they
[2:39:38] would and and the wind was a type of the
[2:39:41] move of the spirit and the move of the
[2:39:44] spirit would come and it would move and
[2:39:47] the rain would come it would be
[2:39:51] blessings but that wasn't what brought
[2:39:55] the seed to
[2:39:58] maturity it was the word that brought
[2:40:02] the seed to
[2:40:04] maturity it was the word that he was
[2:40:07] seeing every day that was being revealed
[2:40:10] to him and transforming
[2:40:16] him to where he learned you can't do God
[2:40:19] a service without it being his
[2:40:24] will all the sermons you
[2:40:27] hear that he's preaching were the very
[2:40:31] things that made him what he
[2:40:35] was he didn't live apart from his
[2:40:41] word if you will allow
[2:40:43] me that's why you can't separate the
[2:40:47] messenger from the
[2:40:53] message
[2:40:54] he
[2:40:56] becomes the
[2:40:58] interpretation of the word
[2:41:02] amen because now his life is a
[2:41:06] reflection of what God had in his
[2:41:12] mind this is how I want my Believers to
[2:41:15] live this is how I want my Believers to
[2:41:19] this is how I want my Believers to know
[2:41:21] me I want them to know I'm not three
[2:41:24] Gods I want them to know there's only
[2:41:27] one provided place of worship I want
[2:41:30] them to know the the things that that
[2:41:34] I've showed you I want you to speak them
[2:41:37] back to them that they too might become
[2:41:42] yes Sons and Daughters of
[2:41:46] God it's not the wind that does does
[2:41:51] it and it's not the rain that does it
[2:41:55] though when the rain falls praise
[2:41:58] God but I don't want a major
[2:42:06] unra the wind is wonderful it causes
[2:42:09] roots to grow but we don't want to
[2:42:13] Major on the
[2:42:15] Wind there's one thing that
[2:42:19] matures the bride and that's the same
[2:42:29] word not a handled word not a secondhand
[2:42:37] word God gave it to his Prophet The
[2:42:40] Prophet gave it to us God did not pick a
[2:42:44] Ministry a five-fold Ministry any
[2:42:47] Ministry
[2:42:49] anywhere to step in between you and that
[2:42:53] voice and say this is what he meant this
[2:42:57] is what he was trying to explain let me
[2:42:59] tell you what he was getting at the word
[2:43:03] will do it by
[2:43:09] itself it's the word that
[2:43:17] matures and that's where I believe
[2:43:20] that the church
[2:43:24] is cuz we were told that what does she
[2:43:28] have to do now she has to lie in the Sun
[2:43:33] and
[2:43:35] ripen she's got to come to
[2:43:41] maturity she she's got to come to that
[2:43:46] place now we know the word word doesn't
[2:43:51] Quicken it's the spirit that
[2:43:54] quickens so God speaks his word and the
[2:44:00] Spirit by
[2:44:02] Revelation comes and makes that what
[2:44:05] does Quicken mean to bring to life to
[2:44:11] make
[2:44:13] alive the spirit comes to make the word
[2:44:18] alive in you not the rain alive in you
[2:44:22] not the wind alive in you but to make
[2:44:25] the word alive in
[2:44:27] you that's what it does the
[2:44:30] spirit is not even to speak of itself
[2:44:34] but to bring you into remembrance of all
[2:44:37] things that I said to me that's one of
[2:44:40] the best scriptures of a expl
[2:44:43] explanation of Revelation that there is
[2:44:50] I will I will reveal it to you
[2:44:55] yes all of us in here are on equal
[2:44:58] footing in equal ground because we all
[2:45:02] can hear the same voice and the same
[2:45:06] word there's no big eyes there's no
[2:45:09] little
[2:45:15] use the word will have the same effect
[2:45:18] on you yes
[2:45:21] amen that it has on everybody don't
[2:45:26] matter where you come
[2:45:28] from doesn't matter if you grew up
[2:45:31] eating rice or you grew up eating
[2:45:33] tortillas or you grew up eating uh weeds
[2:45:38] or whatever you call
[2:45:40] it it don't matter right don't matter
[2:45:44] what you ate didn't matter where you
[2:45:46] slept didn't matter when the word
[2:45:50] strikes the seed
[2:45:54] yes that seed will bring forth of its
[2:45:59] kind my sheep hear my voice and another
[2:46:03] they won't
[2:46:06] follow oh you say Brother David what it
[2:46:09] is that's why I want you to
[2:46:14] know why my heart is so set
[2:46:20] on making that
[2:46:22] voice Available to
[2:46:25] You
[2:46:28] am why it's so
[2:46:31] important that you
[2:46:33] listen to the word of God for the age
[2:46:37] amen because it's not secondhand word
[2:46:41] it's the same word that he spoke to the
[2:46:45] prophet to take him from the Sheepfold
[2:46:50] as he typed
[2:46:53] himself to where that he almost had to
[2:46:56] hide because his gift was so
[2:47:04] great he just spoke it to
[2:47:07] us it was lying right there in what we
[2:47:12] listened
[2:47:14] to he said he did that his word did that
[2:47:20] his word came to me and kept me from
[2:47:23] running down this road running down that
[2:47:27] road he preached it to us in the way of
[2:47:30] a true
[2:47:32] Prophet a prophet stays with what the
[2:47:36] word what word was he staying with not
[2:47:39] man's interpretation of word not the
[2:47:42] historical Bible teachings of other ages
[2:47:45] not the not the conclusions that
[2:47:48] denomination
[2:47:49] made he was taking the word that was
[2:47:52] given to him from God lip ear
[2:47:57] Hallelujah that was the word that
[2:47:59] transformed him
[2:48:03] am where there wasn't Devils that could
[2:48:05] stand in front of
[2:48:09] them that could sit there and say I take
[2:48:11] every spirit in this building in my
[2:48:14] control in the name of Jesus Christ oh I
[2:48:17] love that that head go back he's here
[2:48:21] yes you can't hide
[2:48:25] now you think he popped out of
[2:48:28] bed one
[2:48:33] morning
[2:48:36] no he sat under that word yes that
[2:48:41] word he sat in that
[2:48:44] presence he let that word mold them he
[2:48:48] let that word bring to
[2:48:49] maturity he let that
[2:48:53] word just take every ounce of his own
[2:48:57] desire out of
[2:49:01] them until he was
[2:49:05] molded into a Son of
[2:49:07] God so much
[2:49:11] so that he
[2:49:13] could stand up in our presence and say
[2:49:18] who is this meis
[2:49:23] EDC who is this God in this form amen
[2:49:29] standing in front of you today doing the
[2:49:32] same signs and the same Wonders that
[2:49:35] were
[2:49:37] manifested before
[2:49:41] you what caused
[2:49:47] that the word
[2:49:51] the same word that's on those
[2:49:53] tapes the same word that God gave him he
[2:49:58] turned around and gave us and by the law
[2:50:02] of the word if that word produced that
[2:50:07] son that same word has to produce Sons
[2:50:10] and Daughters of
[2:50:13] God if it doesn't it breaks every law of
[2:50:17] God if it doesn't have the same effect
[2:50:20] on you that it had on him it breaks
[2:50:24] every law of God if if it doesn't bring
[2:50:28] the seed fruit to maturity that was in
[2:50:31] that seed then and it doesn't bring the
[2:50:34] seed that's in you to maturity then the
[2:50:37] law is broken and that's one thing that
[2:50:41] Satan can't do is he can't break the law
[2:50:46] of God
[2:50:50] amen you say Brother Davis what's the
[2:50:54] the desire of your
[2:50:56] heart I don't desire
[2:50:59] Fame I can honestly say that to you I
[2:51:03] don't desire popularity and I don't
[2:51:05] desire
[2:51:07] money but the desire of my heart amen is
[2:51:11] that every one of you comes to the full
[2:51:16] maturity as brother James Hayes shared
[2:51:18] this scripture with me at a very crucial
[2:51:21] time in my life he said herein is the
[2:51:24] love of God manifest that as he is so
[2:51:29] are we in this
[2:51:33] world that's what I want for our
[2:51:36] lives that's what I want for the
[2:51:40] congregation those of you who has
[2:51:42] recently joined
[2:51:43] us I don't want
[2:51:46] nonsense I don't want other people's
[2:51:49] teachings I don't want the way other
[2:51:51] people do
[2:51:53] things I want us to listen yes learn and
[2:52:01] transform that's as simple as I can put
[2:52:06] it because I heard a messenger say
[2:52:09] you're little
[2:52:11] Messiahs you're little
[2:52:13] Gods The Works that I do you will do
[2:52:17] also and I asked myself how did you do
[2:52:21] those Works brother Brandon he did those
[2:52:24] works because he sat under that word he
[2:52:27] was
[2:52:29] corrected he he he he was so public with
[2:52:33] us about his mistakes about his
[2:52:36] shortcomings about his battles why
[2:52:40] because he wanted you to know the word
[2:52:42] that God was giving him would do the
[2:52:45] same thing for you
[2:52:49] if you would listen to it and you would
[2:52:52] believe it it will transform
[2:52:56] you and harvest you and make you into a
[2:53:00] harvest Harvest of
[2:53:03] theable
[2:53:09] grain and that's what it's
[2:53:11] about it's not about going in and out of
[2:53:14] sin and in and out of the world it's not
[2:53:16] about all your mental battles being one
[2:53:19] day up and one day now that's all
[2:53:24] humanism but if you stay in that word
[2:53:28] that word will mature
[2:53:30] you if you stay with that word it will
[2:53:34] take the greenness out of you if you
[2:53:37] stay with what he
[2:53:38] said and you have an absolute of that
[2:53:41] word in your life it will produce a
[2:53:45] Rapture in you
[2:53:50] and I don't know any other way to
[2:53:52] explain it to you this
[2:53:54] morning I'm not an elegant preacher I
[2:53:57] know
[2:53:58] that I don't have the energy I
[2:54:02] had as a young man to run from one side
[2:54:06] of the stage to
[2:54:09] another that's never
[2:54:11] produced
[2:54:14] anything it's what said not how it
[2:54:20] said and I believe
[2:54:24] God showed us how it was to be
[2:54:29] said by how he spoke it to
[2:54:35] us so we're
[2:54:38] here to
[2:54:42] mature in the revealed word of the
[2:54:45] hour as it was revealed
[2:54:49] to God's servant the prophet William
[2:54:51] Mariam
[2:54:53] random that word is our
[2:54:57] doctrine that word is our
[2:54:59] truth that word is our
[2:55:02] example and you can't separate the
[2:55:05] messenger from the word amen I never
[2:55:10] meant brother brand the privilege of
[2:55:12] meeting his sons and his daughters his
[2:55:16] children many of his Associates and
[2:55:20] managers you know as much as I've
[2:55:25] enjoyed those times none of them can
[2:55:29] ever
[2:55:30] do for
[2:55:32] you and to
[2:55:37] you other than what's on those
[2:55:41] tapes you say why do you preach then
[2:55:45] because on the tapes he said to do it
[2:55:52] that's and
[2:55:55] obedience is better in
[2:55:59] sacrifice in closing I'll say
[2:56:03] this the word of God is what positions
[2:56:07] you amen nothing else positions you but
[2:56:12] the word because the word and each of
[2:56:16] you he tapes whatever seed God planted
[2:56:20] in you whatever it is that God wants you
[2:56:23] to be the word is the only thing that
[2:56:27] can bring that into
[2:56:32] maturity when men
[2:56:35] leave the voice and the
[2:56:38] word to do the
[2:56:41] maturity they are
[2:56:43] positionally
[2:56:45] placing themselves right
[2:56:49] yeah the scripture warned against
[2:56:52] lording over God's
[2:56:56] Heritage they want to take a position of
[2:57:00] leadership they want to take a position
[2:57:04] of example amen they want to they they
[2:57:08] they want to position the church where
[2:57:11] they think it should be positioned amen
[2:57:15] I have no idea
[2:57:18] amen of what God's going to
[2:57:22] do I'm not looking for chair wheelchairs
[2:57:26] to come down this aisle though they
[2:57:31] may I'm not looking for anything to
[2:57:34] happen but what he's got planned
[2:57:38] yes and I know there's only you can't
[2:57:41] produce
[2:57:42] it a sheep doesn't produce it Bears wool
[2:57:47] a sheep made to do what eat
[2:57:50] grass bear wool what's the Bride made to
[2:57:54] do eat word bear
[2:57:58] word not produce it not make it
[2:58:02] happen we're not trying to make a
[2:58:07] Revival we're not trying to fill
[2:58:12] buildings we want to
[2:58:14] mature we want to Bear wool and
[2:58:19] that's my
[2:58:22] stand that's what drives
[2:58:25] me that's what makes me
[2:58:31] live cuz if I could identify myself if
[2:58:35] you would allow me I was a ragged
[2:58:39] long-haired drug addict
[2:58:42] Tippy sitting on a rooftop
[2:58:48] just left the Catholic
[2:58:51] church after trying to study to be a
[2:58:55] priest so
[2:58:58] despondent so away from God that I was
[2:59:02] on the
[2:59:03] verge of joining a motorcycle gang and
[2:59:08] becoming a Hell's
[2:59:11] Angel and if it wasn't
[2:59:14] for the grace of God
[2:59:18] I probably wouldn't even be alive
[2:59:23] today but he came into my
[2:59:26] life and he came into my life by a
[2:59:31] voice within my spirit not lift the ear
[2:59:35] but within my spirit within my
[2:59:38] Consciousness and within my
[2:59:40] imagination he he read to
[2:59:43] me Romans chapter 1
[2:59:50] and saved
[2:59:52] me and changed me
[2:59:56] amen then a few years
[3:00:00] later I sat
[3:00:02] in a a little
[3:00:06] home in San
[3:00:09] Diego with the hippie comune that
[3:00:13] gathered up because I went to street
[3:00:15] preaching and and different people on
[3:00:18] the street came and they lived with us
[3:00:22] maybe my friend Bill L is listening this
[3:00:25] morning if you are brother Bill God
[3:00:27] bless
[3:00:29] you and we gathered
[3:00:33] together and we put on
[3:00:35] a little message called
[3:00:40] Christianity versus
[3:00:43] paganism and there was that voice
[3:00:49] and I knew that was the voice of
[3:00:52] God I knew it was the voice that
[3:00:54] transformed me and I knew it was the
[3:00:57] voice that was going to take me all the
[3:01:00] way I believe
[3:01:03] it and I listened to another
[3:01:07] tape and it was
[3:01:09] called the love of God or when love
[3:01:13] projects and then I knew that though
[3:01:16] that tape condemned me
[3:01:19] me and I didn't think that maybe I
[3:01:22] wasn't saved after all then that voice
[3:01:25] came to tell me that God loves
[3:01:28] me and I can say this morning I'm not
[3:01:32] worthy but God loves
[3:01:38] me I couldn't tell you
[3:01:41] why I've given him no reason
[3:01:45] to but he does
[3:01:48] and I'm
[3:01:50] appreciative and then I listened to a
[3:01:52] tape called choosing of the
[3:01:55] bride and I packed my
[3:01:58] bags and I moved to
[3:02:01] Montana and lying in my bed in
[3:02:05] Montana God told me that I'd preach the
[3:02:09] gospel in
[3:02:11] Texas I didn't know if it was one time
[3:02:14] or not it took me several years to get
[3:02:17] here
[3:02:19] and we got
[3:02:20] here had my children with me for the
[3:02:25] whole journey my wife sister lesie who I
[3:02:29] think is a model of a pastor's wife am

[3:02:42] always going to be my
[3:02:45] sweetheart and

[3:03:00] endure with my fleshly side and my human
[3:03:04] side because I'm working on that too yes
