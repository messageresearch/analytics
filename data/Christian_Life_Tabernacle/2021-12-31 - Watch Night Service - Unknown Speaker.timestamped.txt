[52:44] anybody who'd like to testify and

[52:50] just a quick testimony i know how it is
[52:52] when you go to testify
[52:54] you want to put everything in it all but
[52:56] just we can kind of condense it down and
[52:59] have a few testimonies somebody that the
[53:01] lord's been faithful or true or somebody
[53:03] like to say a testimony what the lord's
[53:06] done for them we'll bring the mic
[53:09] to you so
[53:10] if you'd like to have a testimonies
[53:12] anybody have a testimony that they'd
[53:14] like to share
[53:16] no testimonies well then well we're
[53:19] going to do
[53:20] all right we got a testimony all right
[53:23] jeff wants to testify
[53:34] amen
[53:37] yeah i just
[53:38] wanted to uh
[53:41] i'm gonna say that the lord has been
[53:43] faithful
[53:44] uh
[53:45] and true to me not not that i don't have
[53:47] anything fresh to testify of but i just
[53:49] think it's a really awesome thing that
[53:51] he did it was so humbling
[53:53] when he uh gave me the revelation that
[53:56] he was going to protect me from this
[53:58] coveted
[53:59] uh thing
[54:01] and
[54:02] he's been faithful to do it you know the
[54:04] devil's tried to come against the
[54:06] revelation but
[54:08] you know the lord's been faithful and
[54:10] and i just want to thank him for that uh
[54:12] i feel so unworthy that he'd do
[54:15] something like that for me
[54:17] but uh i just want to give him
[54:19] thanks and praise
[54:21] um
[54:22] for his faithfulness
[54:25] [Applause]
[54:39] okay i have a couple of things actually
[54:41] we had had prayer for my
[54:43] daughter-in-law's father
[54:45] um i don't know about a month ago
[54:46] because he was in the hospital with
[54:48] covet on a ventilator
[54:51] uh they did not give him any chances to
[54:53] live he had like a 20 chance to live
[54:56] and we prayed and i went home and i told
[54:58] my son and his wife i said don't worry
[55:01] we prayed at church everybody's praying
[55:03] for him he's going to be fine
[55:05] well he went home today
[55:12] one more thing that i just
[55:14] you know god is so good and god does
[55:17] things that
[55:19] the devil likes to tell you that that
[55:21] didn't really happen but you know it
[55:23] happened and you keep it in your heart
[55:25] and you know what happened and
[55:26] we were in arizona for thanksgiving we
[55:29] took my parents out to go see
[55:32] my daughter and our grandchildren and
[55:34] we went to the grand canyon and
[55:36] my daughter carries a backpack which is
[55:38] also her purse because you know she's
[55:40] got babies and
[55:41] and it's her diaper bag and purse and
[55:43] her wallet
[55:44] was in her side pocket
[55:46] and we're walking and all of a sudden
[55:48] she turned around and she looked and her
[55:49] wallet was about to fall out of her
[55:51] backpack
[55:52] and she goes oh my goodness i keep that
[55:54] zipped and so i was like well we better
[55:56] zip it up so we zipped it up we went on
[55:58] about our business
[56:00] went back to phoenix we stopped in
[56:02] flagstaff at sam's club to get gas and
[56:04] we're in an rv so we pull in they pull
[56:06] it in their van
[56:07] they get out and all the kids get out
[56:09] and
[56:10] scott asked kristin said can i have your
[56:12] sam's card so i can go get gas and she
[56:14] goes well it's in my wallet so they go
[56:16] to the backpack
[56:17] while it's not there
[56:19] and
[56:20] [Music]
[56:23] so
[56:24] they looked vigilantly through their van
[56:27] they looked through every bag they
[56:28] looked through every box they looked
[56:30] through everything
[56:31] kristen was in tears because her wallet
[56:34] basically had her life in it
[56:36] and so i wound up giving scott my sam's
[56:39] card and i said just go get gas we'll
[56:40] find it
[56:41] well she went through her backpack again
[56:43] no wallet
[56:45] she was in tears she's trying to not
[56:47] think about it
[56:48] and she's she said it'll show up and so
[56:52] i snuck her backpack and i went to the
[56:54] front of the van
[56:56] and i took everything out of her
[56:58] backpack
[56:59] and i went through it no wallet
[57:02] so i go back in i just left her backpack
[57:04] sitting on my seat at the front and
[57:07] so i go back in the rv and she's sitting
[57:09] in there and she's tending to her baby
[57:11] and i went to walk by her and something
[57:13] was just like stopped so i stopped
[57:17] and i put my arm around her and i just
[57:19] prayed and i said god
[57:21] you know where that wallet's at wherever
[57:23] it's at we know you can put it back
[57:28] and we believe in that and we have faith
[57:30] in that and we know we're you're going
[57:32] to take care of it wherever it's at
[57:36] and i said amen and i just patted her on
[57:37] the shoulder and i said everything's
[57:39] going to be okay now
[57:41] and i walked about did my thing and like
[57:43] five minutes later david come to the
[57:45] door of the rv
[57:47] and he's standing there crying with
[57:49] christian's wallet in his hand
[57:52] and i was like where did you find his
[57:53] wall her wallet and he's like
[57:56] something just told me to go look in the
[57:57] top of her backpack
[58:00] so he went and looked and he opened it
[58:02] up and her wallet was laying right on
[58:03] top
[58:10] so
[58:11] we know who put it there and you know we
[58:14] we thought about the fact that maybe
[58:15] somebody was trying to pick pocket or
[58:17] whatever but
[58:18] you know we just wondered along with
[58:20] hers how many other wallets god put back
[58:22] that day when we prayed
[58:24] so we just thank god for that and i just
[58:26] wanted to share amen
[58:29] hallelujah
[58:32] you know
[58:34] there's going to be a lot more
[58:35] testimonies like that amongst god's
[58:38] people because those are the testimonies
[58:40] that separate the believer from the
[58:42] unbeliever
[58:44] you know there's a lot of people they
[58:45] just won't believe that
[58:47] you know there's got to be some logical
[58:49] reason
[58:51] you know it's stuck to the top of the
[58:53] wrapper or the velcro done but anything
[58:57] else but god
[58:59] putting it back yeah sir so i'm looking
[59:03] for that anybody else have a testimony
[59:07] all right there he got one
[59:11] right here behind you
[59:30] god bless you
[59:57] good night
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:12] and the pavement was
[1:00:14] slippery
[1:00:24] but when i turned right
[1:00:26] i saw
[1:01:38] it was either
[1:01:40] or nothing
[1:01:43] the car was
[1:01:44] normal
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:50] i said thank you god
[1:02:46] we
[1:02:57] amen
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:03] maybe you have time for a couple more
[1:03:06] anybody else have a testimony they'd
[1:03:08] like to
[1:03:10] give this evening
[1:03:12] okay
[1:03:18] testify so when i was in kentucky
[1:03:22] because
[1:03:23] god was protected from the
[1:03:25] tornado
[1:03:27] was up in there
[1:03:29] just only miraculous
[1:03:31] i don't know what to say
[1:03:33] i was uh at work
[1:03:35] so the time was tornero coming i i had a
[1:03:39] knowledge in my phone
[1:03:40] and i keep praying god
[1:03:42] protect my family over there because i
[1:03:44] live with his brothers
[1:03:46] so when i went home all the light was
[1:03:48] shut down was so darkness everywhere
[1:03:52] so the time the time i get in my house
[1:03:56] there is no
[1:03:57] no light
[1:03:59] no electrician and it everything was
[1:04:01] shut down
[1:04:02] then when i was in the morning i just
[1:04:05] come out
[1:04:06] oh the neighbor's house was followed
[1:04:08] down
[1:04:10] was like broken the people died
[1:04:12] so but uh say it's only grace of god i
[1:04:15] came like he being alive
[1:04:18] yeah and then i i was praying god and
[1:04:20] praising him
[1:04:22] because he's the one who gave me chance
[1:04:24] to
[1:04:25] uh he's the one who practiced my home
[1:04:28] also
[1:04:29] yeah i'm not even good person but just
[1:04:32] only for his grace and mercy
[1:04:34] thank you for that
[1:04:43] praise the lord i
[1:04:44] remember the first time that i
[1:04:47] i came to
[1:04:49] texas i had to do some little work in
[1:04:52] amarillo and i remember the first time
[1:04:55] that i've heard of a tornado
[1:04:58] a warning
[1:04:59] i think i was the only guy i was out in
[1:05:01] the street looking at the sky you know i
[1:05:04] mean
[1:05:04] didn't know what to do go get my bathtub
[1:05:07] you know
[1:05:08] i didn't know what to do it seems funny
[1:05:10] now
[1:05:11] you hear it you don't even stop
[1:05:14] you know what i mean but this one was
[1:05:16] real
[1:05:17] hey man we really appreciate that
[1:05:20] i'd like to just give a little testimony
[1:05:23] um if i could uh
[1:05:26] you know we've been working um
[1:05:31] from we decided in our heart and we just
[1:05:34] felt it was the lord and
[1:05:36] that we needed to build
[1:05:39] a new
[1:05:41] sanctuary because
[1:05:43] we just don't have any sunday school and
[1:05:46] our hearts just been
[1:05:47] burdened
[1:05:48] and we wanted to take
[1:05:50] this
[1:05:52] building here and
[1:05:54] put five sunday school rooms in it and
[1:05:56] then
[1:05:57] take the rest of it and turn it into a
[1:06:00] fellowship hall
[1:06:02] uh where we could have uh
[1:06:04] get-togethers and and other events uh if
[1:06:08] people wanted to use it for
[1:06:11] uh weddings or whatever the lord could
[1:06:14] do and then we could have a place that
[1:06:16] everybody could
[1:06:18] sit in the sanctuary together right
[1:06:21] it just burdens me when people are in
[1:06:24] the overflow and they're looking just
[1:06:26] like everybody in the congregation
[1:06:27] together
[1:06:28] so we started to work on it and as
[1:06:32] everybody knows the pandemic began to
[1:06:34] break out and
[1:06:36] and
[1:06:38] jobs shut down material prices
[1:06:41] went up through the roof
[1:06:44] a sheet of plywood went from twelve
[1:06:46] dollars and five cents to 42 dollars
[1:06:50] and you know we needed about 90 sheets
[1:06:54] uh for our roof two by fours went
[1:06:59] and from
[1:06:59] five cents to seven dollars a piece and
[1:07:02] the material prices just went through
[1:07:05] the roof
[1:07:06] we couldn't have attendants
[1:07:09] nobody could come into the
[1:07:11] church building we're limited with the
[1:07:13] number of people and of course you know
[1:07:16] a church operates on the freewill giving
[1:07:20] of the people and
[1:07:22] and
[1:07:24] and so if you don't have services and
[1:07:26] you don't have people together
[1:07:28] you know it's just hard to function
[1:07:31] and it just seems like we just couldn't
[1:07:34] get the project off the ground
[1:07:36] and every time we'd send a plan to the
[1:07:39] city they would find something
[1:07:42] with it and
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:44] they'd give us a list and we would go do
[1:07:47] it again and
[1:07:48] then we bring it over and they give us
[1:07:50] another list
[1:07:52] and
[1:07:53] we did this six times
[1:07:56] so after six reviews and drawing all the
[1:08:00] blueprints
[1:08:01] and everything we finally
[1:08:04] yesterday
[1:08:06] the city
[1:08:08] wrote us and said they finally accepted
[1:08:11] all of our drawings
[1:08:13] and everything
[1:08:15] and that
[1:08:19] we
[1:08:20] now
[1:08:21] can apply for the permits
[1:08:24] and we're going to be in the permit
[1:08:26] application
[1:08:28] stage where we have to put in
[1:08:31] all the
[1:08:33] things that go with it
[1:08:35] so
[1:08:36] we just need uh all of your help uh
[1:08:40] i i thank god it's all been god's timing
[1:08:43] perfectly
[1:08:45] because
[1:08:46] slowly our congregation's been able to
[1:08:48] come back and
[1:08:50] covet had caused some people to move
[1:08:52] different places and
[1:08:54] and people have come and gone but we're
[1:08:56] starting to stabilize again
[1:08:58] and uh
[1:09:00] we'll try to have a nice sanctuary where
[1:09:02] there's plenty of room and plenty of
[1:09:04] seats and everybody spread out so we're
[1:09:08] on that journey
[1:09:09] and we'd like it if it's like upon your
[1:09:12] heart that you know you would
[1:09:14] maybe do some extra fasting and praying
[1:09:17] that the lord would uh
[1:09:20] guide us on just all the necessary steps
[1:09:24] we have to dig across the street and we
[1:09:27] have to dig some ditches and lay some
[1:09:30] fire lines and
[1:09:31] and
[1:09:32] so the church down the street
[1:09:35] has
[1:09:36] said that we could park in their parking
[1:09:38] lot so we may have to park in their
[1:09:41] parking lot
[1:09:42] use this building
[1:09:44] there might be some services that we
[1:09:46] have to rent another place and
[1:09:48] have another service while we do certain
[1:09:51] things so we're going to go into a
[1:09:53] process but
[1:09:55] i just like to thank the lord that his
[1:09:58] timing has come
[1:09:59] material prices have come down
[1:10:02] we were able to redesign our building in
[1:10:05] our parking lot to save us
[1:10:08] you know probably about a 150 to 170 000
[1:10:12] and
[1:10:13] so we've done good
[1:10:15] we have some money set aside
[1:10:18] our building fund
[1:10:21] has
[1:10:22] about
[1:10:23] 530 thousand dollars in it and we also
[1:10:27] have another two hundred thousand
[1:10:28] dollars
[1:10:29] set aside so
[1:10:31] we we're in a good place
[1:10:34] by god's grace to to grow
[1:10:37] and to
[1:10:38] be able to have meetings and to do
[1:10:40] things so uh i just think that's
[1:10:42] wonderful
[1:10:44] a thing that the lord's done so
[1:10:47] we hope by
[1:10:49] the second week in january we'll start
[1:10:51] construction
[1:10:53] so watch your kids be careful we're
[1:10:55] going to have to fence areas off and
[1:10:58] have to move dirt which is going to be a
[1:11:00] very interesting time
[1:11:02] but we know who the master builder is
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:05] amen paul said we have a master builder
[1:11:08] right and he'll lay the chief
[1:11:10] cornerstone so we just trust that you
[1:11:12] will uh
[1:11:13] bless that to us amen i'd just like to
[1:11:16] ask a couple of the deacons just to come
[1:11:18] up and say a word brother chris where
[1:11:21] are you at brother chris harris is he
[1:11:22] here somewhere
[1:11:24] i thought he's back there
[1:11:26] come brother chris
[1:11:29] i beckon thee my brother
[1:11:36] come speak to the flock
[1:11:39] amen uh i rather
[1:11:41] avielle one day he was uh
[1:11:45] he got to talking to jackson and he said
[1:11:47] brother jackson
[1:11:49] he says i see you take your job very
[1:11:52] seriously and
[1:11:54] brother jackson said yes
[1:11:57] he says well he said i saw today that
[1:12:00] you made two arrests
[1:12:04] so
[1:12:05] i thought you know
[1:12:07] uh
[1:12:08] they they
[1:12:10] they
[1:12:11] say they're the policemen of the church
[1:12:13] but
[1:12:14] you know what the motto of a policeman
[1:12:16] is right to protect
[1:12:18] and serve so we just asked brother chris
[1:12:20] say a few words to you god bless you
[1:12:25] thank you brother david
[1:12:32] you know i don't have anything specific
[1:12:34] every day we say is a testimony
[1:12:38] i think last year or year before we were
[1:12:41] asked to put something together and i
[1:12:43] said
[1:12:44] my thought was he still is and he still
[1:12:46] is my provider from the day that i felt
[1:12:50] his call on my heart
[1:12:52] i haven't regretted it he's supplied my
[1:12:54] every need
[1:12:56] he's taking care of everything that we
[1:12:57] have need of
[1:13:00] and long story short you know
[1:13:03] if if i gave a testimony of anything
[1:13:06] just the sacrifice that you think that
[1:13:09] you're making
[1:13:10] sometimes
[1:13:12] of what i'm doing
[1:13:14] you know whether it be work or finances
[1:13:16] or church or even to be here this
[1:13:18] evening
[1:13:20] god will always always take care of your
[1:13:22] needs he will always out pay you
[1:13:26] always bless you beyond measure
[1:13:29] and today
[1:13:31] you know
[1:13:33] my goodness i just feel blessed beyond
[1:13:35] measure where i'm at in life and at
[1:13:36] times i thought the decisions that i
[1:13:38] made that i thought i was doing for the
[1:13:40] right reason and i thought i was doing
[1:13:42] for god i didn't get the outcome that i
[1:13:44] thought i was going to get i had it
[1:13:46] planned this is what the heavens are
[1:13:48] going to open up and we're going to
[1:13:49] shower down blessings because i did this
[1:13:51] little thing
[1:13:52] and it's in god's timing
[1:13:54] so
[1:13:56] just
[1:13:57] we love him we're thankful
[1:14:00] i have no regrets whatsoever
[1:14:02] and just for the next year i just my
[1:14:05] harsh desires to draw closer to him
[1:14:07] you know you feel you feel the word
[1:14:10] coming across
[1:14:12] less of us and more of him and it just
[1:14:14] becomes so much more personal you know
[1:14:16] lord i want to believe the word that you
[1:14:18] have for me i want to accept it and i
[1:14:20] want to manifest it in me for your will
[1:14:22] and your plan in my life
[1:14:24] so that's my that's my heart's desire
[1:14:26] for this new year
[1:14:35] i think i saw gary somewhere scary
[1:14:37] hiding also
[1:14:42] these deacons really like to help one
[1:14:44] another
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:47] out
[1:14:48] all they can and uh
[1:14:51] and
[1:14:51] well they're digging up brother gary
[1:14:53] brother tim why don't you come say we're
[1:14:55] different
[1:15:05] i've lost my deacon status
[1:15:09] amen i
[1:15:11] appreciate being able to uh
[1:15:17] just be able to come together
[1:15:20] look around the room
[1:15:22] and realize that
[1:15:28] we're just common vote
[1:15:31] we're following
[1:15:33] an uncommon message
[1:15:36] with uncommon truth
[1:15:40] and
[1:15:42] much could be said
[1:15:44] in
[1:15:48] about this past year
[1:15:56] you know the bible
[1:15:58] talks about unclean things
[1:16:03] some of them being fouls
[1:16:06] spirits like frogs
[1:16:08] and brother branham said that
[1:16:12] i'll control myself in a minute
[1:16:19] that a frog was an unclean being
[1:16:23] because every time he jumped he looked
[1:16:25] backwards
[1:16:28] we don't want to look back we won't look
[1:16:30] forward
[1:16:35] and my dear dad tells me
[1:16:37] at least once a week the best is yet to
[1:16:40] come son the message yet to come
[1:16:44] and if i could i just hear
[1:16:47] a couple scriptures
[1:16:49] that
[1:16:53] you know the lord quickens things to you
[1:16:55] and maybe it's just a little passage
[1:16:57] a little
[1:16:59] reference and then you get to search in
[1:17:01] your bible and you find it
[1:17:03] and it's like
[1:17:04] that's what i was looking for
[1:17:07] and then you read a couple verses ahead
[1:17:09] a couple verses after and say that may
[1:17:11] be what i was looking for but that's
[1:17:12] what i really needed
[1:17:14] and uh that happened to me just a few
[1:17:16] minutes ago
[1:17:18] and if you don't mind on the screen if
[1:17:20] you've got a bible with you tonight
[1:17:22] romans 14
[1:17:24] verses 5 to 9.
[1:17:34] and uh
[1:17:36] you know even from the opening march
[1:17:38] tonight
[1:17:39] brother cosmic said you know we
[1:17:41] we could be a lot of places
[1:17:43] we could be doing a lot of different
[1:17:45] things
[1:17:49] but i think this is the best place that
[1:17:50] we could be
[1:17:52] in his presence
[1:17:53] let's just read this we could
[1:17:56] one man esteemeth one day above another
[1:18:00] another
[1:18:01] esteemeth every day alike
[1:18:04] and we see that constantly everybody's
[1:18:06] got an opinion they want to exalt it or
[1:18:08] somebody doesn't even have an opinion
[1:18:10] and they don't care let every man be
[1:18:12] fully persuaded in his own mind
[1:18:15] he that regardeth the day regarded it
[1:18:17] unto the lord and he that regardeth not
[1:18:20] the day to the lord he does not regard
[1:18:22] it he that he defeateth to the lord for
[1:18:24] he giveth god thanks and he that he is
[1:18:26] not to the lord he eateth not and giveth
[1:18:28] god thanks
[1:18:30] for none of us liveth to himself and no
[1:18:33] man dieth to himself
[1:18:35] for whether we live we live unto the
[1:18:37] lord and whether we die we die unto the
[1:18:39] lord
[1:18:40] whether we live therefore or die we are
[1:18:43] the lord's
[1:18:45] for this end
[1:18:46] christ both died and rose and revived
[1:18:50] that he might be lord both of the dead
[1:18:52] and the living amen blessed be the name
[1:18:55] of the lord now there's a couple more
[1:18:56] scriptures i want to read but having
[1:18:58] said that
[1:19:02] we know that if we're going to
[1:19:04] suffer with him if we're going to reign
[1:19:06] with him we have to suffer with him
[1:19:10] galatians 5 24 says and they that our
[1:19:12] christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:19:15] affections and lust
[1:19:17] okay so we can say hey that part of us
[1:19:19] is already dead that that's gone when
[1:19:21] when you accept calvary the sacrifice of
[1:19:24] calvary
[1:19:25] is not only for a future salvation
[1:19:28] but he crucified the deeds of the flesh
[1:19:30] we need to honor that and accept that in
[1:19:32] our own lives first peter
[1:19:34] 4 verses 1 through 8 please
[1:19:39] and i believe
[1:19:42] we're coming to the very last stages of
[1:19:44] the son of man ministry
[1:19:46] i believe that
[1:19:48] brother branham taught us the last stage
[1:19:50] of every man's ministry was preaching to
[1:19:53] the eternally lost okay
[1:19:55] and i'm not
[1:19:57] saying there won't be one born out of
[1:19:58] due season because we know we're looking
[1:20:00] for that lost seed
[1:20:02] or the last seed
[1:20:05] but
[1:20:07] as you know i've said it before
[1:20:10] our lives are a testimony
[1:20:12] but what if our life is a judgment
[1:20:14] message
[1:20:15] what if we're i mean god's a just god
[1:20:17] he's going to have
[1:20:19] you've witnessed on the street in the
[1:20:21] job place wherever you're at
[1:20:24] you're a testimony right
[1:20:26] okay first peter four
[1:20:29] don't be too long just read this
[1:20:36] verse 1 for as much then as christ hath
[1:20:39] suffered for us in the flesh
[1:20:41] arm yourselves likewise with the same
[1:20:44] mind for he that has suffered in the
[1:20:46] flesh has ceased from sin
[1:20:49] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:20:51] of his time in the flesh to the lust of
[1:20:53] men
[1:20:54] but to the will of god
[1:20:56] that's what i desire
[1:20:57] for the time past of our life
[1:21:01] may suffice us to have wrought the will
[1:21:03] of the gentiles that's the past
[1:21:05] when we walked in lasciviousness lust
[1:21:07] excess of wine revelings back weddings
[1:21:10] and abominable idolatries a lot of that
[1:21:12] going on tonight
[1:21:13] wherein they think it's strange that you
[1:21:15] run not with them to the same excess of
[1:21:17] riot speaking evil of you even speaking
[1:21:20] evil of you that you want to attend
[1:21:22] their parties to go to their nonsense
[1:21:24] who shall give account to him that is
[1:21:26] ready to judge the quick and the dead
[1:21:28] that's our lord both dead and the living
[1:21:31] for this cause was the gospel preached
[1:21:33] also to them that are dead
[1:21:36] think of that
[1:21:38] for this cause was the gospel preached
[1:21:40] also to them that are dead that they
[1:21:42] might be judged according to men
[1:21:44] in the flesh but live according to god
[1:21:48] in the spirit
[1:21:49] but the end of all things is at hand
[1:21:52] be therefore sober and watch unto prayer
[1:21:56] and this is the key verse of course and
[1:21:58] above all things have fervent charity
[1:22:00] among yourselves for charity shall cover
[1:22:03] the multitude of sins
[1:22:05] it doesn't mean have charity for the
[1:22:06] world and with the world it says charity
[1:22:09] among yourselves so here in the
[1:22:11] household of faith it's easy to wrap our
[1:22:13] arms around one another and say brother
[1:22:15] i love you sister we love you that kind
[1:22:18] of thing so
[1:22:19] i just uh i want to lean on those things
[1:22:22] this year and realize that we're blessed
[1:22:24] beyond measure we're blessed beyond
[1:22:26] measure for the message that we've
[1:22:28] received lord bless you
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:39] that's a good thought
[1:22:45] gary you could have walked down the
[1:22:46] center aisle
[1:22:59] i'm not sure how you follow that up but
[1:23:01] um
[1:23:04] you know
[1:23:05] 2021 just kind of seemed like a
[1:23:07] continuation of the previous year you
[1:23:10] know
[1:23:12] not a lot
[1:23:13] maybe not a
[1:23:15] not a lot of milestones or
[1:23:18] you know
[1:23:20] maybe didn't stand out as much as 2020
[1:23:22] did but
[1:23:24] you know something just
[1:23:26] you know i was even just sitting back
[1:23:27] there thinking about
[1:23:28] you know just
[1:23:30] even the years that i've been here
[1:23:32] already coming upon 10 years now
[1:23:35] just passes so quickly
[1:23:39] you know but
[1:23:41] even in my 10 years here there's many
[1:23:44] ones that have been here longer but
[1:23:46] just seen you know many come and he go
[1:23:50] and um
[1:23:52] you know the scripture that i was just
[1:23:54] been thinking about
[1:23:56] is matthew 24 13.
[1:24:00] um
[1:24:02] but he that shall endure unto the end
[1:24:05] the same shall be saved
[1:24:09] you know and even if you back up there
[1:24:11] in verse 11 many false prophets shall
[1:24:14] rise and shall deceive many and
[1:24:17] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:24:19] of many shall wax cold
[1:24:22] but he that shall endureth unto the end
[1:24:25] the shame shall be saved
[1:24:28] so just
[1:24:29] just thinking about
[1:24:32] how much
[1:24:33] we press on and endure
[1:24:37] for the lord you know and
[1:24:40] you know there's been a lot of tough
[1:24:43] tough things these past couple years for
[1:24:45] sure
[1:24:47] you know but
[1:24:49] we know these trials and tribulations
[1:24:50] bring about
[1:24:52] a character
[1:24:54] you know and so
[1:24:56] i just i just been thinking about
[1:24:59] those that endure
[1:25:01] those that endure because
[1:25:04] you know i feel like god's looking for
[1:25:05] someone to fight
[1:25:08] you know to press through to really
[1:25:09] fight to not give up you know and
[1:25:12] brother david
[1:25:14] he preached uh
[1:25:15] i preached
[1:25:17] a service i think it was back in the
[1:25:18] spring when he when he preached birth
[1:25:21] pains just really spoke to me
[1:25:24] you know how a birth pain is a mess and
[1:25:27] you know it's it's a battle and
[1:25:31] it's in though it's in that time in that
[1:25:33] battle in that moment when it's a hot
[1:25:36] mess that
[1:25:39] there comes a birth
[1:25:40] you know and so
[1:25:42] those are the times he made a statement
[1:25:44] of those are the times you see a person
[1:25:46] make the worst decision of their life
[1:25:49] and so you know i just thinking about
[1:25:51] how
[1:25:53] these past couple years we've seen come
[1:25:55] some come we've seen some leave and just
[1:25:58] how
[1:25:59] lord i just want to endure to the end
[1:26:02] lord i want to press the fight
[1:26:05] the anchor holds
[1:26:07] i mean i'm evident of that you know just
[1:26:09] it's not any of my doing it's what he
[1:26:11] did for me and so
[1:26:13] you know it's just been a blessing to
[1:26:17] to not have
[1:26:19] the love wax cold because
[1:26:22] you know his brother dave talked about
[1:26:23] you know our body is a body of love you
[1:26:26] know i
[1:26:27] been to a few churches and
[1:26:30] you definitely don't see the love that
[1:26:33] we have here
[1:26:35] everywhere
[1:26:36] to have someone care when they don't
[1:26:38] have to
[1:26:40] you know to reach out when they don't
[1:26:42] have to
[1:26:44] to to take your hand and and even help
[1:26:46] you press the battle
[1:26:48] when you when they don't have to
[1:26:51] but um
[1:26:52] no i'm just looking forward to
[1:26:54] some mountaintop victories in 2022
[1:26:56] personally
[1:26:58] um
[1:26:59] but yeah i didn't have a whole lot
[1:27:00] tonight just
[1:27:02] just looking to endure to the end and
[1:27:04] and keep fighting
[1:27:06] not give up so
[1:27:08] god richly bless you
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:16] if objective you the deacons will get
[1:27:18] ready for the communion
[1:27:20] uh and then we'll uh
[1:27:23] pass that out and and
[1:27:25] i i know brother billy's been sick and
[1:27:28] he
[1:27:28] can't talk very much but i miss his
[1:27:31] voice
[1:27:33] and
[1:27:34] and
[1:27:35] he's given me that look but that's okay
[1:27:40] he gives me that look i got your i'm
[1:27:42] going to pay you back
[1:27:44] but billy see if you come up and squeak
[1:27:47] out a few sentences for us
[1:27:49] if you don't mind we love you so much
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:59] as you know brother billy's a real
[1:28:00] blessing to me and he
[1:28:02] helps me and it just really is
[1:28:05] wonderful to
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:24] steel
[1:28:34] certainly thankful to the lord for
[1:28:36] everything
[1:28:38] you know
[1:28:42] we have an adversary
[1:28:44] you know and uh
[1:28:49] he's is really at every corner to
[1:28:53] to
[1:28:54] just
[1:28:56] tackle you down and
[1:28:59] you know like brother gary was saying it
[1:29:00] seems like
[1:29:05] sometimes it's just
[1:29:07] one thing after another you know and
[1:29:10] um
[1:29:13] amen but we thank god because we know
[1:29:16] that victory is part of the promise amen
[1:29:19] and
[1:29:21] you know just ask that you continue to
[1:29:23] pray for us
[1:29:24] um
[1:29:26] i know
[1:29:27] you know i stand by the david i feel
[1:29:29] like
[1:29:30] just i'm tired of being sick you know
[1:29:33] you just go from one roller coaster to
[1:29:35] another you
[1:29:36] you feel like you're getting better and
[1:29:38] then you know something else happened
[1:29:39] and
[1:29:40] and it's just
[1:29:42] um
[1:29:42] you know so many things but
[1:29:45] i i believe all of that is just
[1:29:48] part of our experience
[1:29:50] you know you
[1:29:52] oftentimes things happen and
[1:29:55] um
[1:29:58] and in the natural it seems like the
[1:30:00] devil is trying to get you to
[1:30:02] um
[1:30:05] to to be weak and and to do all of that
[1:30:09] but yet within that same time frame
[1:30:12] within your spirit there's a great
[1:30:14] resolve because
[1:30:16] you come to realize that
[1:30:21] not everything is for certain
[1:30:23] and therefore
[1:30:25] everything i have i'll put into this
[1:30:28] everything i have i'll serve god with it
[1:30:31] everything i have i'll do what i can
[1:30:34] because we even life is not guaranteed
[1:30:37] we don't know what tomorrow hold
[1:30:40] but one thing we know is
[1:30:42] whatever time frame he's giving us will
[1:30:45] serve him we'll do all that we can to
[1:30:48] to serve him and to fight the battle and
[1:30:51] to continue on and
[1:30:54] because we know that
[1:30:56] that's part of the promise
[1:30:58] he promised to be with us even in us
[1:31:00] until the end
[1:31:02] and
[1:31:03] what we're going to celebrate at the end
[1:31:07] is to just look back and see how it's
[1:31:10] been guiding us all along
[1:31:13] to see how
[1:31:15] when we were down when we were up when
[1:31:17] we
[1:31:18] thought this is too much when we thought
[1:31:21] we couldn't handle this when we thought
[1:31:23] this
[1:31:24] in fact i'll say this
[1:31:28] it's
[1:31:30] it's in times like that they
[1:31:32] really the nature of christ get to be
[1:31:35] birthed out of us
[1:31:37] it's not when
[1:31:39] things seems to just go our way and
[1:31:42] when we think we understand it all
[1:31:45] but it's in those
[1:31:46] birth pains like brother
[1:31:48] gary just mentioned
[1:31:51] it's in that time that
[1:31:54] you really get to become a new person
[1:31:56] and his image gets to come out of you
[1:31:59] because why
[1:32:00] the flesh is dead
[1:32:02] amen is certainly thankful for that and
[1:32:04] god bless you amen
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:15] there's definitely come say a few words
[1:32:17] to us
[1:32:19] and
[1:32:22] i have an interpreter if you need one
[1:32:27] amen
[1:32:28] we'd also like to
[1:32:30] mention to the church
[1:32:34] many of you may have known that
[1:32:37] brother paul and his family they had a
[1:32:40] fire
[1:32:41] in the apartment next door to them
[1:32:44] and
[1:32:45] they're they were forced to leave their
[1:32:47] apartment
[1:32:49] and the fire marshal
[1:32:50] hasn't allowed them to go back and
[1:32:53] get their things or anything and they're
[1:32:55] staying in a motel so if any of you
[1:32:58] would feel led and have it on your heart
[1:33:01] to maybe
[1:33:06] help them out a little bit in any way i
[1:33:08] just wanted to make let you know that
[1:33:11] uh there's a need there and i know many
[1:33:13] of you have a giving heart but
[1:33:16] you just don't know the needs but you
[1:33:18] know so brother paul could sure use
[1:33:20] any little thing you can talk to him
[1:33:23] about it or talk to brother billy and
[1:33:25] we'll see what you can do
[1:33:27] for them so i just wanted to let you
[1:33:29] know that it's nice to have brother paul
[1:33:31] with us and
[1:33:32] we'll try to get him in the pulpit
[1:33:34] before he leaves my brother
[1:33:46] god bless you
[1:33:52] thank you brother david
[1:33:56] i wrestle multumask
[1:33:59] i just want to thank the lord
[1:34:02] and uh
[1:34:03] andrej biserich and the entire church
[1:34:07] penthouse
[1:34:09] for his grace
[1:34:15] and his goodness that renews every
[1:34:18] morning
[1:34:22] i have a few verses that i would like to
[1:34:24] read before you
[1:34:28] she says

[1:40:48] 21 of the book of revelations as i tell
[1:40:52] you the future
[1:40:56] and i saw a new heaven
[1:40:59] and a new earth
[1:41:01] from
[1:41:02] for the first
[1:41:04] heaven
[1:41:05] and the first
[1:41:06] earth were passed away
[1:41:09] and there was no more sea
[1:41:12] and i john saw
[1:41:15] the holy city
[1:41:17] the new jerusalem
[1:41:19] coming down from god
[1:41:21] out of heaven
[1:41:22] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:41:26] husband
[1:41:28] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:41:32] saying
[1:41:33] behold the tabernacle of god
[1:41:36] is with men
[1:41:38] and he will dwell with them
[1:41:41] and they shall be his people
[1:41:44] and god himself shall be with them
[1:41:48] and be
[1:41:49] their god
[1:41:50] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[1:41:53] their eyes
[1:41:55] and there shall be
[1:41:57] no more death neither sorrow
[1:42:01] nor crying
[1:42:03] neither shall there be any more
[1:42:06] pain
[1:42:07] for the
[1:42:08] former things
[1:42:10] are
[1:42:11] passed away
[1:42:13] and
[1:42:14] he that sabbath upon the throne said
[1:42:18] behold
[1:42:19] i'll make all things new
[1:42:22] and he said unto me
[1:42:24] write for these
[1:42:27] words are true
[1:42:30] and faithful
[1:42:32] i thought of everything that this world
[1:42:35] is looking forward to
[1:42:37] and everything what this world worries
[1:42:40] about will the stock market crash
[1:42:44] what does it do what if it profiteth the
[1:42:46] man if he gains the whole world and
[1:42:49] loses this
[1:42:51] i don't have my glasses
[1:42:53] i might be on my desk
[1:42:57] but anyway i'll try to read if i could
[1:42:59] if you can find it
[1:43:01] in
[1:43:01] the future home
[1:43:03] it's paragraph 275
[1:43:06] but
[1:43:08] and it it's uh
[1:43:11] i just talking about what really
[1:43:15] we're living for
[1:43:17] you know that it's it's more than
[1:43:20] anything else you can't find them okay

[1:43:28] it says let's just listen to what our
[1:43:30] messenger tells us

[1:43:36] of sin is gone
[1:43:38] when the holy ghost accepts you
[1:43:42] see you don't accept it it accepts you
[1:43:46] see because it's god's attribute
[1:43:49] see
[1:43:50] if it's the holy ghost means god's
[1:43:53] spirit
[1:43:54] and it's the attribute
[1:43:56] the thought of god has accepted you
[1:44:00] because that you
[1:44:02] were ordained
[1:44:04] for
[1:44:05] that purpose
[1:44:07] just think there's a people that are
[1:44:09] ordained for that place
[1:44:11] that he's talking about

[1:44:16] that's my future
[1:44:19] amen heaven and earth will pass away but

[1:44:25] things are faithful
[1:44:27] and true they're true and faithful

[1:51:58] go to a place
[1:52:00] you're the delegation
[1:52:03] of god
[1:52:04] but don't let this world shake there
[1:52:08] because all satan's trying to do is
[1:52:10] present his eden
[1:52:13] his world
[1:52:14] and we see what he does
[1:52:17] wars rumors of wars storms
[1:52:21] starvations

[1:52:25] with all the power that man has
[1:52:28] that can't feed themselves they can't
[1:52:30] take care of themselves they can't stop
[1:52:32] killing themselves
[1:52:34] hatred blooms
[1:52:36] people are divided the country's divided
[1:52:39] everywhere but don't you see what he
[1:52:41] said here he says god and man has
[1:52:44] embraced heaven and earth
[1:52:46] has come together
[1:52:48] that's what this is all about
[1:52:51] don't
[1:52:53] be ashamed
[1:52:54] to bear the reproach
[1:52:57] of this message
[1:53:00] for a season
[1:53:02] and lose
[1:53:05] what's been totally vindicated
[1:53:07] to us to be true
[1:53:10] and faithful remember don't ever get
[1:53:13] mixed up with the fact
[1:53:15] that this is salvation there's a lot of
[1:53:17] people that'll be saved
[1:53:19] but won't be there
[1:53:23] but i'm going to a city a new jerusalem
[1:53:27] that's come down god has a place for
[1:53:30] those but i want to go on that rapture
[1:53:32] don't you i want to be a part of that
[1:53:34] delegation that's going to be in that
[1:53:37] new city so the lord richly

[1:53:43] brothers have the communion ready and
[1:53:46] you will come and
[1:53:48] we'll we'll pray for it and
[1:53:51] and
[1:53:52] we'll ask that you know the scriptures
[1:53:54] tonight we don't won't necessarily read
[1:53:58] our communion scriptures but we know how
[1:54:00] to take communion
[1:54:02] and
[1:54:03] i don't know if they'll come out we'll
[1:54:06] when they do but to anyway let's when
[1:54:08] when you look forward
[1:54:11] the scripture says no man the man that
[1:54:14] storeth his treasures here on earth he
[1:54:17] says they're easily broken in and taken
[1:54:20] he said but story your treasures in
[1:54:22] heaven where no man can break in and
[1:54:24] take them from it you know
[1:54:27] our freedoms are getting lost the
[1:54:29] prophet of god said be thankful that you
[1:54:31] can still meet and still have service in
[1:54:34] a matter of hours your money can become
[1:54:38] worth you know your money's already lost
[1:54:40] six percent
[1:54:42] of its value
[1:54:44] what would you do tomorrow if gas went
[1:54:45] to ten dollars a gallon
[1:54:49] how much money would you have then
[1:54:52] if gas went to 50 a gallon
[1:54:55] you had to walk everywhere
[1:54:57] just think no matter how bad it gets
[1:55:00] one day
[1:55:02] i have a true
[1:55:04] and faithful
[1:55:06] promise
[1:55:07] and god sent us a witness
[1:55:11] not to witness
[1:55:13] what he was
[1:55:15] but to witness
[1:55:17] the present tense god of what he is
[1:55:21] and to vindicate to us and prove to us
[1:55:24] that there's a future home of the
[1:55:26] heavenly
[1:55:27] bridegroom
[1:55:28] and the earthly bride so god bless you
[1:55:31] we're going to pray for the bread and
[1:55:33] wine
[1:55:34] then
[1:55:35] you come up and take your
[1:55:37] take your cup and your piece of bread
[1:55:40] go back to your seats so we can come
[1:55:43] through quickly and then we'll all have
[1:55:46] communion
[1:55:47] together
[1:55:48] our heavenly father
[1:55:51] we know that
[1:55:54] this bread represents your body
[1:55:57] lord and it also represents the word
[1:56:01] being made flesh
[1:56:04] the body word lord
[1:56:07] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:56:09] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:56:12] father and now this broken bread
[1:56:14] represents that it's a many-membered
[1:56:16] body
[1:56:18] but yet this body is now going to be the
[1:56:21] word made flesh
[1:56:24] father we are so grateful for that
[1:56:27] father this wine represents that the
[1:56:30] price that was paid
[1:56:32] for the body
[1:56:34] father that it could
[1:56:36] come into that unity and you could dwell
[1:56:39] and the stimulation in the wine
[1:56:42] representing the life
[1:56:44] that was in that
[1:56:47] blood
[1:56:48] and then that life returning back onto
[1:56:51] that believer which is represented by
[1:56:54] the bread heavenly father and we see in
[1:56:57] communion the perfect revelation of the
[1:57:01] plan of god as our lord and savior went
[1:57:04] to calvary father and made the great
[1:57:07] restitution for our sins that we could
[1:57:10] be free and once again become in the

[2:07:19] um
[2:07:20] just to give a little insight for sunday
[2:07:23] morning we have one
[2:07:24] service this sunday at 11
[2:07:29] a.m 11 a.m
[2:07:32] one service this sunday and then after
[2:07:35] that we'll be back on our our normal
[2:07:38] schedule so 1 30 this
[2:07:40] sunday and we're going to
[2:07:42] minister out of the 16th chapter of
[2:07:46] saint john
[2:07:47] and the 13th verse
[2:07:50] so
[2:07:53] that's the scripture that brother
[2:07:54] branham uses for the world falling apart
[2:07:58] so i say that so you can all go there
[2:08:02] read the scripture maybe read the book
[2:08:04] and each of you
[2:08:05] put together
[2:08:07] what sermon
[2:08:08] you would preach
[2:08:11] and then we'll see how the holy spirit
[2:08:13] comes and how many of your thoughts and
[2:08:15] ideas that are all united i believe with
[2:08:18] all my heart that this is going to be
[2:08:20] the year that the body is going to work
[2:08:22] together more than it ever has
[2:08:26] that we're going to take on one
[2:08:28] another's burdens that we're going to
[2:08:30] believe for things that the world might
[2:08:33] think is impossible that we're going to
[2:08:35] see real transformation
[2:08:38] we're going to see those that have gone
[2:08:40] out from us
[2:08:41] returning back home
[2:08:43] i believe this is the year of the
[2:08:45] prodigal son
[2:08:47] i believe with all my heart
[2:08:49] where it's going to shake
[2:08:51] to those that are are elected
[2:08:54] even those that have come up and said
[2:08:56] well i i don't think see how i can
[2:08:58] believe the message that god will show
[2:09:01] them how they can believe the message
[2:09:03] amen
[2:09:04] that the i sab is going to pour out on
[2:09:07] the heart of the true believer you say
[2:09:10] well what makes a true believer what
[2:09:12] makes a true believer is any man or
[2:09:15] woman no matter where they are that god
[2:09:17] put the seed of god in their heart
[2:09:20] that's what makes him a true believer
[2:09:23] and there's not one seed that he planted
[2:09:25] he said because you were part of the
[2:09:28] earth
[2:09:30] how many knows you're part of the earth
[2:09:32] that's why the blood had to fall on the
[2:09:34] earth he had to redeem every part of you
[2:09:37] and he said that it's going to come up
[2:09:39] because you were called for this purpose
[2:09:41] so i don't care where they are
[2:09:44] it could be in the military they could
[2:09:45] be on a crab boat out in the antarctic
[2:09:48] ocean but if they are god's children
[2:09:51] there comes an hour that they're going
[2:09:53] to return home
[2:09:55] amen and everybody's got the perfect
[2:09:58] time
[2:09:59] of their salvation
[2:10:01] we always wonder why did he wait till
[2:10:04] now
[2:10:05] why did he wait so long to call me
[2:10:08] why did i have that you know he didn't
[2:10:10] call you
[2:10:11] because of you he called you because of
[2:10:14] the world around you
[2:10:16] that the timing of your
[2:10:19] salvation
[2:10:20] was that it would have an effect or a
[2:10:24] judgment
[2:10:26] that's a good thought brother kevin i
[2:10:28] wanted to start preaching right there
[2:10:29] buddy
[2:10:32] or a judgment there's a reason for the
[2:10:35] timing
[2:10:37] amen i i
[2:10:40] you know
[2:10:41] i think of sister
[2:10:43] jeanette alexander in her 80s getting
[2:10:46] baptized and all she could say why did
[2:10:48] it take me so long why did god had the
[2:10:52] perfect
[2:10:53] timing
[2:10:54] so just remember he's in control all
[2:10:57] we're asked to do is have what
[2:10:59] expectation
[2:11:01] and believe so i i trust this is a year
[2:11:04] that we'll pray more
[2:11:06] we don't call group fast it's like we're
[2:11:09] all going to fast we because the
[2:11:11] scripture says don't let anybody know
[2:11:13] that you're fasting but wash your face
[2:11:16] and that men might know it but
[2:11:18] any time that you want to
[2:11:20] give a period of prayer
[2:11:23] a period of fasting and and drawing
[2:11:26] closer to the lord and paul talks in the
[2:11:28] scriptures of husbands and wives
[2:11:30] separating for a season that they could
[2:11:33] become closer to the lord anything you
[2:11:35] can do to draw nigh unto him
[2:11:38] he'll draw nigh unto you
[2:11:41] and if he draws nigh into you and he's
[2:11:43] with you he's going to rub off on
[2:11:45] everybody that's around you your life
[2:11:48] worldly the contacts in the world and
[2:11:51] also the body
[2:11:53] as our cups fill up over
[2:11:56] let's be an expectation
[2:11:58] this is the year in the chinese calendar
[2:12:02] of the
[2:12:04] of the water tiger
[2:12:07] it only comes every 60 years
[2:12:10] and it represents boldness i thought you
[2:12:13] know
[2:12:14] who wants to be a a chinese calendar
[2:12:18] you know what year it is in god's
[2:12:20] calendar it's the year of the eagle
[2:12:23] hallelujah it's those that wait upon the
[2:12:26] lord shall renew their strength they
[2:12:28] shall mount up with wings like eagles
[2:12:31] why don't you play
[2:12:32] that they shall run
[2:12:35] and not be weary
[2:12:37] you believe that
[2:12:38] amen

[2:13:09] get a preview he said i will show you
[2:13:12] things to come

[2:13:23] that there's no forgiveness in this
[2:13:25] world or the world to come

[2:13:49] backflip state you may have the world

[2:13:54] kinds of weaknesses but let me tell you
[2:13:57] there's a promised time of a deliverance
[2:14:00] of a dedication of a separation of a
[2:14:03] cleansing of a coming out let that be
[2:14:06] right
[2:14:07] provided god said when you're sick

[2:14:13] at a
[2:14:14] well man
[2:14:17] sitting in front of you
[2:14:19] if that's for the physical how much more
[2:14:21] for the spiritual if that
[2:14:24] if that's a type of the physical if
[2:14:27] you're sick you're laying there and
[2:14:28] you're sick and you're weak you've got
[2:14:30] to imagine yourself i i don't like to

[2:14:35] a vision
[2:14:37] of yourself standing up whole
[2:14:41] well eating
[2:14:42] if you don't feel you can put one thing

[2:15:17] in me because he promised me the works
[2:15:20] that i do shall you do also and when it
[2:15:23] leaves he said the problem with the
