there's nothing that substitutes for a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus you know to know that he loves you oh if we could just know that you know that he loves us above all things let's approach him our gracious father your love is so great father that well we were yet sinners you died for us and you loved us father you even gave yourself for the whole world even though you knew many wouldn't believe on you and that they would turn from you but yet because it was who that you were that the love of God was shed abroad in your heart and Lord and our desire is that we put on that nature that we have that spirit in US for there's a promise in the scripture that saidth the same spirit that dwelt and Jesus Christ dwells in our mortal body The Same Spirit that quickened him it would also Quicken us father and that's what we're here for we're living for father we're living for your soon appearing father and there's no substitute in the world and what would a man give in exchange for his soul father we just asked that you'd put a steadfast burning in our heart to seeking for you and we just ask your blessings on us in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated at thank you for musicians and everything the Lord be with you I I was looking did your father-in-law make it I don't see him is he there oh good well anyway brother Raphael's been with us for a a a few weeks now resting and he told me that he was all rested up so I I'm I told him I was going to have him I have one of our services this Sunday but I just like them to come now and just greet you all for uh this evening brother Raphael or are you hiding there he is come my brother ah come come and greet the people our brother from brazzerville and this is uh in his life's with us and this is judita's Father this is Billy's father-in-law so uh you know he's he's the one that's got the keeps everything in line here we love our brother God bless you brother thank you and uh I guess Billy can interpret for you unless you agreed Us in English all right God bless you brother and sisters this is my second house and I am happy to be among you this is a surprise from Brother David but I think I think if he give me opportunity I will do something for the people of God As You Are my English is growing because many of you are praying for me God bless you amen so we know that speaking in tongues is a true gift amen amen I appreciate that I I always love my brother's Spirit anyway and Matthew has just got back from a week in Romania preaching there and and reaching out and I'd like him to just come if he would at this time and just tell us a little bit about his trip and what he felt the spirit was and how it was moving and we're always it was your support that helped send him and so we'd just like to have him come and and uh you know I've got three sons that preach now that's pretty good you know what I mean and uh uh I remember Doug mchughes a good friend of mine he's gone to be with the Lord but many years ago when the boys were just getting converted and you know I think David I was one of the ones that got converted first and Matthew wasn't converted yet and David got converted so David went and took all the Matthew's stuff out of the house and threw him out of the house and I came home one day and all Matthew's clothes and everything was on the front porch because he threw him up and and Davey would wait up every night and tell Matthew came home to give him a piece of his mind anyway he he he was just longing for his brother to come to the Lord and all three of my sons have come to the Lord Aaron's pastoring in Phoenix are real proud of him there David just started preaching he's always been a testifier but he's just got a real loving spirit for the people and of course Matthew kind of a fireball maybe I was like that when I was his age I don't know but anyway I'm just proud of what he's doing and the opportunities that are opening for him he may have a trip for to Spain coming up so we want to keep him in prayer but Matthew tell us a little bit about the trip if you wouldn't mind hey man it's good to be back home this is where my heart is I've told the brothers this is this is where I like to be and and Lord keeps opening doors away from here but we just want you to know that our hearts always to be here with each one of you we love you dearly and we're we're thankful for the opportunity that God has opened up to us in Romania um I was praying about something we could do for the Lord and and when we I got to talk in a brother cosmen about something we could do and Lord opened up some doors for us in Romania so this trip back we we had about 10 we had 10 Services um uh we we landed in um Budapest which is in the country of Hungary and it's a about a three hour drive from a rod Romania where brother Gabriel matinee is a a pastor who has been the key to Romania and a lot of contacts there's a lot of established churches in the northern part of Romania um and there's established Believers in the southern Parts but but their buildings and uh their churches as far as structures and things uh gathering in homes and trying to build some Churches and not as established in the South uh this this time we uh the main reason we went was for the Youth Camp but before we got to the youth camp we um we drove over into Iran and then from a rod there's about a hour or so drive down to Timmy shawar Romania where there's a church we ministered there Saturday night and we ministered Sunday morning and Sunday night at brother Gabriel's and then we drove a couple hours to minister in irania um on Monday which it's always nice to be there because my Uncle Dennis he he uh he was he ministered at that church some 20 uh 25 27 years ago so it's just it's wonderful to see that the work that God's been doing and how he's put the message on brother's Hearts to spread the message and so some plant some water but God gives the increase and so we're happy to be able to go in and encourage the the Bride of Jesus Christ and to spread the message so from Monday we went down into kalues which was about a three hour drive a small Church there and then another three or four hour drive into biomra for Wednesday and then we got to the camp for Friday where we preached four Services Friday night Saturday morning Saturday night Sunday morning and then we had to drive back after we preached Sunday but just on my heart for the for the Youth is just uh was to really my heart's desire for the Youth is to really establish them in the message of the hour and and not in a theology not in an intellectualism but in the revelation and so we the first service we we wanted to bring the youth to a decision to make a decision the second service was no more excuses uh it's time time to be Sanctified and then the third and fourth service was was just uh we didn't even really get to our notes the Lord just really poured out his holy spirit it was real Supernatural because we had lost our voice by the eighth service my voice was gone for Saturday night but as I stepped into the pulpit the Lord just gave me a supernatural touch to be able to minister and then Sunday morning when we we got to the pulpit uh I told the kids that you'll never forget the service because it sounds like a frog up here I had no voice and then um when we right when we took our text the anointing come and you can hear it on the recording God supernaturally gave us our voice but that I just my heart's desire was to really establish the young people into really getting a revelation of what Malachi 4 5 and the life of what this message produces not rules not regulations um but true Overcomers in the last days with with the same signs and same wonders the same life not not in a church setting but but to really minister to them that when you go home the same life of Jesus Christ the same life that you witnessed in the messenger um the same Revival that we have in the church house has to be the Revival that you live in every single day of your life and that's what the message produces is true Born Again filled again Daughters of God and when once you get that then it's all about living for others then it's about getting other people to the Revelation that you've received because that's what the Christian Life is In eternal life is is living for others so we we covet your prayers they worked they work and if it wasn't for you we wouldn't be able to go and I know many of you were praying for us and it made the difference so we just love you dearly and thank you for your support and uh just want to give you a little update so God bless you [Applause] I think that I we're all coming to the greater realization that the baptism of the Holy Ghost isn't just an experience though it is an experience but it's what that experience produces and that's the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the holy spirit it's it's the it's the key to the identification of the church is that they'll know that you are my disciples by your love one for another and that's a lot of what's on my heart tonight we're just we're not going to be very long I just want to read a scripture and then I'd like to go through the sixth chapter of the Gospel of Luke just read the sixth chapter of the Gospel of Luke and then when we're done doing that in Philly that leads us in a song then anybody that wants to go to Brahms afterwards I'll buy the ice cream is that fair that's fair I only do this when there's a small crowd so and if if you if you see anybody show up that wasn't here you don't let them get in line okay anyway do you love the Lord let's stand and turn to Ephesians there's uh so we let's turn to if that fee uh I'm sorry Philippians um Philippians the second chapter and the fifth verse and along with that I want to read John 13 17. and I'll read John 13 17 first very short verse it says if you know these things happy are you if ye do them and I I I uh I want to emphasize the joy that comes from doing good the the joy that comes from living God's word uh the the I I enjoy studying God's word and and that's in your intellectually stimulating uh it's marvelous how the scriptures have fallen together it's it's amazing how that God could lay so much of all of man's life in such a small book really but there's no part of man's existence that the word of God doesn't cover this this scripture is our life's blood it is the the joy to your heart it's the instruction for everything so happy are you if you do these things and then let's read Philippians the second chapter he says and we'll just read there starting with the first verse he says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory let nothing be done through strife in other words if their Strife or tension or friction don't do a thing you are in it pray till your heart's pure don't act you know one thing that we know never correct your children when you're angry you know what I make nothing comes out of it good uh so uh in fact when you do that you're teaching that child that it's okay that could that becomes normal in an abusive relationships where maybe one of the partners abuses the other one A child growing up and seeing that they think that's love they think that's normal and that cycle continues on as Aaron preached one time a great message he's calling breaking the cycle you know if you don't break that cycle it'll continue so what a what a what a great lesson just there in that verse let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind Let each esteem the other better than themselves oh my try that I don't mean fake right you know like I said humility is not the way you act it's the way you think if you could be humbled by the love of the Lord to where you look on on somebody else and esteem them as better than you because how are you esteeming them as the purchase price of the blood of the Lamb amen he says he says look on every man's on look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man now let's look at this mind of Christ all right let this mind that being you that was in Christ who being in the form of God thought it not Robert to be equal with God now this is his mind but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated we've been we've been preaching just a little bit about a thinking man's filter so what we've realized as people that Peter in the we know that in Peter he preached what we refer to as the statue of a perfect man add to your faith you know he says you know so she you'll add your faith uh virtue and virtue patience and and you add these virtues and when it all comes together it comes to the Capstone which is the love of God and so we realized that we the carnal mind is enmity against God so the carnal mind doesn't think the way God thinks the carnal mind Minds the things of the flesh that Minds the things of the world it's it's the nature of man and that's what we're trying to overcome we're trying to overcome our nature because we know the battle is in our mind that's where the Battleground is the word of God comes and and the the census and the emotions and everything they speak to us so we realize that we've come to the understanding that we have to take all of our thinking no matter what stimulated that thinking what caused that thinking you know whether no matter what it is and we've got to stop recognize that thinking isolate that thinking away from ourselves if I could say that and take that thinking and filter it through the word of God until we have the mind of Christ because the word of God is the mind of the Lord that's what a word is it's a thought expressed all through the Old Testament God expressed his love for Israel he expressed his Redemption for Israel he expressed his forgiveness for Israel everything about his nature was shown in how that he treated the Seed of Abraham the Royal Seed of Abraham which was the children of faith and so he built everything on that so we're understanding we're starting to realize that yes we we've got a carnal mind but that carnal Minds against God but the spiritual mind is life and so you can't come up with a spiritual mind from a carnal source you can't educate yourself into a spiritual mind because all your resources are fleshly okay so you're you're not going to build something that's spiritual from something that's flesh it will read that in the scripture that good figs don't come from thistles so there's no way for that life to come from any resource you have in yourself so that that makes me happy because it's not going to be held accountable to me for my flesh to reproduce a spiritual mind the only thing that can produce a spiritual mind is the spirit isn't that right and so what is the gift of God it's eternal life it's the spirit of the Lord that's what God wants to do if we'll repent of our sins will be baptized in his name he will send to us and give us the gift of his spirit now what does the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit doesn't come and speak of itself but it brings you into remembrance of all the things that he taught wonderful so what's it going to do the Holy Spirit himself is going to present to you the filter and so what's a filter do it takes out all the impurities so when you start filtering your thinking through the word of God the word of God is going to change the way you think so when you get through the filter you're going to end up with the Holy Ghost you filter every thought until there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost and you know there's a lot of questions about the evidence of the Holy Spirit but we know one thing the evidence of the holy spirit is to say Amen to every word of God so what what the amen is is when the word of God It Go your thoughts go through the filter everything that the word produces you say Amen what is only amen mean so be it so be it I accept this as the way that it is I accept this as the outcome this is the word this is my reality my perception has to be filtered until I accept the reality of the word and say so be it so we understand then that if God had a word he had to have a thought before that word and the word is the expression of his thinking and so if you go back and you start studying uh the things that the Lord preaches you'll find out that that his whole approach to all of Israel was changing their thinking why because he's taking them from the law right to Grace that's what he's doing it said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you you know can you so you read the Beatitudes you read his approach he's actually trying to say God's doing something for you so now I want you to start looking and changing the way that you think so I wanted to read this sixth chapter because as you go through it you start to see that Jesus is a a dressing I was going to use the word attacking but I I don't think that he did anything out of malice I think that him in addressing it was to try to break the chain that they have and sometimes we get a chain in our mind that's what a complex is a complex is when you have a chain on your mind and you can't break that thinking so it has you and and we want to break any thinking so this sixth chapter is a marvelous chapter and and so uh let's just uh read it together and I'm not a very good reader so you you fill right in for me it says and it came to pass on the second Sabbath after the first that he went through the cornfield and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them with their hands and certain of the Pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day so see they're thinking right it's not lawful to pick the corn and wipe it with your hands on the Sabbath now Jesus is now approaching that thinking and Jesus answered them and Jesus answering them said have you not read so much as this what David did when himself was unhungered and they which were with him how he went into the house of God and it take and eat the showbread and gave also to them that were with him which is not lawful to eat but for the priest alone and he said unto them that the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath and it came to pass also on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was withered and the scribes and the Pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the Sabbath day that they might find an accusation against them now look at their mindsets okay okay now we look at their mindset but we've got to the scripture can't be upset of binoculars it's got to be a mirror you understand we find ourselves having a lot of these presumptuous thinkings and judgments you know uh and and so they're they're just sitting there they are so locked in to their prejudicial judgment mind that he's going to start attacking I I didn't want to use that word he's not attacking them he's he's addressing that legalistic mindset that's depriving them from Common Sense thinking so now these guys are all religious I mean they are they're the scribes they're the Pharisees they're all dressed up they're they're really things so he so they might find an accusation against them but he knew their thoughts so he knew their what thinking do you think he knows your thinking amen you think he might want to deal with your mind I think he does don't you he does me but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he rose and stood forth then Jesus said unto them I will ask you one thing is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it can you imagine they never ever thought that but why could he say that because he was the maker of the law now he's interpreting to them the intention of the law in the first place this is Grace and looking around about upon them all he said unto the man stretch forth by hand and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other praise God how many say praise God how many would have loved to have been there now this is what poison thinking does and they were filled with Madness and can communed one with another what they might do to Jesus that is a sad State of Affair I don't want to get in that State of Affair he's giving us a filter and it came to pass in those days that he went out unto the mountain to pray and continued all night and prayed to God and when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of them he chose 12 whom also he named apostles Simon his name was Peter Andrew his brother James John Philip Bartholomew Matthew and Thomas James the son of alphaeus and Simon called uh zeltus or I think and Judas the brother of James and Judas Iscariot which also was a traitor and he came down with them and stood in the plane and in the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all of Judea and around Jerusalem and from the Seacoast of Tyra to sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed and the whole multitude sought to touch him for their went virtue out of him and he healed them all and he lifted up his eyes and on his disciples and said blessed be the poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for you shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they say shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake rejoice in that day and leap for Joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich for you have received your consolation woe unto you that are full for you shall hunger wo unto you that laugh now for you shall mourn and weep we'll unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did they their fathers and the and fathers to the false prophets but I say unto you which cure love your enemy do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you that's tough you know I usually pray for a thunderstorm you know you want you want Wrath you know can you imagine actually being such control of your spirit when someone despitefully uses you because someone says evil about you you have such control over your spirit such control over your emotions such control over the your reaction that you're not offended in their vile conversation but you rejoice praise God thank you Father and you actually pray for him now this is who he's coming for he's not coming for your theology he's coming for your character he's coming for your heart now hold that about your heart because he's going to touch on that okay so let's just read he said um and he says but I send you which here I send you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you now this is a brand new way of thinking this is Grace it's the same thing the father's doing to you father forgive us our sins as we forgive those that trespass against us so he's expressing what the father has done to us now he's wanting this mind to be in us that was also in Christ Jesus and unto him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek also offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbidden not to take thy coat also give to every man that asketh of Thee and of him that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again my how does that one set with you I almost think maybe California scriptural right you can go in and take 800 out of the store and nobody says anything I'm just saying what he said if someone come asks not back for it if they take what's yours this is this is I uh how do you get this mind you get this Mind by meeting The Thinker himself and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thanks have ye for Sinners also love those that love them and if you did good to them which do good to you what thanks have ye for Sinners also do even the same and if you leak lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thanks have ye for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much again but but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil you know we just think God's just a big old ball of Wrath up there nope he's kind to the unthankful and to the evil be their merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven a lot of wisdom right there give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall give unto your bosom for with the same measure that ye meant with all it shall be measured to you again and he spoke the parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch so now he's he's addressing all this negative thinking that he's just talked about you know getting your own asking for it back you know that's my cloak and I want it back in lending and then he sums all of that up as being blindness can the blind lead the blind in other words who can't they see they can't see the god that's merciful to be unthankful and kind to the evil if you can set your eyes on him that's reality and so he says he says can the blind lead the blind won't they both fall in the ditch this the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master that our goal he's talking to us about what real Perfection is it isn't the doctrine though you must have sound Doctrine because false Doctrine will create a deceptive perception of God that's the purpose of twisting the word is so you don't see God for what he really is aren't you glad for a messenger that divinely interpreted the word so we could see the revelation of Jesus Christ and he said and why beholdest thouk the moat in thy brother's eye but perceiveth not the beam that is in thine own eye neither how can this doubt say to thy brother brother let me pull out the moat that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye look you you that's beautiful because you can't do nothing for nobody else until you can look at yourself the word has got to become a mirror not binoculars how can you do anything for anybody else until you can perceive your own weaknesses your own failures then you can have compassion he that he says Thou hypocrite cast out first The Beam out of thine own eye then shalt thou See Clearly to pull out the moat that is in that brother's eye for a good treat bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bringeth forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit for of a Thorns men do not gather figs nor of Bramble Bush do that gather gather they grapes a good man out of the good Treasures of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasures of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speak it carnal mind is enmity with God in other words until we filter our thinking we cannot produce gospel fruit which can produce good works that appear to be it you can do a good work with a bad heart but there's nothing that pleases God more than a pure heart now let's listen he says speak and why call ye Me Lord when and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doth them I will show you to whom he is like to hear his words and to do how important is that listen he is like a man which buildeth a house and dig it deep and lay the foundation on a rock and when the floods arose the stream beat vehemently up upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doth not is like a man that without a foundation buildeth a house upon the Earth again which the streams did Veet vehemently and immediately it fell in the ruin of that house was great isn't the word marvelous I I really think for myself that I must go back to this word with the intention of not studying it but of washing my mind the renewing of your mind by the washing of the water of the word to let this mind be in us that was in Christ Jesus to Humble ourselves to the mighty hand of the Lord and will be exalted in due season amen you love the word I just hope the words of blessing it's our life study it read it go through it take your time read the Gospels of the Lord Jesus and have your Bible say I just think God will bless you because we'll have Billy close the service lead us in a few songs and then you can just pick your flavor now last time all the young Brothers got big banana splits so let's try to keep it uh one or two dips dude if you
