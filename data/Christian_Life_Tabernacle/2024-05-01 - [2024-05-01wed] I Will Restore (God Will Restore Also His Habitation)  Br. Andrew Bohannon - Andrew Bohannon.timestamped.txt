[48:39] you in your faithful hands in Jesus
[48:41] Christ amen amen if you want to turn
[48:44] with me in your Bible we're going to go
[48:46] to the Book of
[48:52] Joel we'll read there in chapter one and
[48:57] I was looking around at the flowers
[48:59] today and the trees outside and my
[49:02] everything just seems to be coming into
[49:04] bloom the grass is looking greener and
[49:07] it's really uh so wonderful and so we're
[49:10] certainly grateful that we can see the
[49:13] natural but my if we could ever see what
[49:16] God's doing that's that's what our
[49:18] heart's craving that's right in Joel
[49:22] chapter 1 it says the word of the Lord
[49:24] came to Joel the son of
[49:27] pathal hear this ye old men and give ear
[49:32] all ye inhabitants of the land hath this
[49:35] been in your days or even in the days of
[49:38] your
[49:39] fathers tell ye your children of it and
[49:43] let your children tell their children
[49:45] and let the children another
[49:49] generation that which the Palmer worm
[49:51] hath left hath the Locust eaten and that
[49:54] which the Locust ha left had the
[49:57] cankerworm eaten and that which the
[49:59] cankerworm hath left hath the
[50:01] caterpillar
[50:02] eaten and then another verse over there
[50:05] in chapter 12 of the same book I'm I'm
[50:08] sorry chapter
[50:10] 2 in 25 it
[50:14] says and I will restore to you the years
[50:16] that the Locust hath eaten that's right
[50:19] the cankerworm and the caterpillar and
[50:21] the Palmer worm my great Army which I
[50:24] sent among you and ye shall eat in
[50:27] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[50:29] name of the Lord your God that hath
[50:32] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[50:35] shall never be ashamed and ye shall know
[50:38] that I am in the midst of Israel and
[50:41] that I am the Lord your God and none
[50:44] else and my people never shall be
[50:47] ashamed amen one more uh scripture
[50:50] reading in Genesis chapter
[50:53] 20 speaking about Abraham
[50:57] we see you know the natural types the
[51:00] spiritual and we see this relationship
[51:03] that Abraham and Sarah had there in
[51:07] chapter 20 we'll read verses 6 and 7 it
[51:11] says this in Genesis 20 and6 says and
[51:15] God said unto him in a
[51:17] dream yay I know that thou did this in
[51:22] the Integrity of your heart in thine
[51:24] heart for I also o withheld thee from
[51:27] sinning against me therefore suffer I
[51:30] Thee not to touch her now therefore
[51:33] restore the man his wife for he is a
[51:37] prophet and he shall pray for thee and
[51:40] thou shalt live and if
[51:43] thou restore her
[51:46] not know thou that thou shalt surely
[51:50] die thou and all of that are thine amen
[51:54] we trust the Lord will add a little
[51:56] blessing to the reading of his word you
[51:58] may have your
[52:00] seat you know it just um it's one of
[52:04] those things
[52:06] that I was Lord had placed two thoughts
[52:09] on my heart and I just didn't know
[52:11] exactly what one was for this service so
[52:14] I kind of wrestled back and forth and
[52:16] seemed like yesterday it seemed like the
[52:18] Lord really opened the door to this
[52:21] inspiration about a title I want to
[52:23] speak to you tonight I will restore
[52:26] and I was listening to a
[52:29] message couple weeks ago
[52:32] and you know it just really stuck out to
[52:35] me and so in light of you know having a
[52:38] new sanctuary and you know we when we
[52:41] dedicated the the house of the Lord uh
[52:44] we were listening to God in Simplicity
[52:46] you know one of the things that stuck
[52:49] out to me in that admonition is you know
[52:52] sometimes in the buildings of a new
[52:54] church you know sometimes we get a
[52:55] little start
[52:57] you know and we just know that that's
[52:59] just part of it right and so sometimes
[53:01] in life you just go through stuff right
[53:03] and that's to have an experience but
[53:06] what does God want to do while we're
[53:07] having the experience well God wants to
[53:10] declare his promises in our lives he
[53:12] wants us to partake in his different
[53:15] attributes and so sometimes we go
[53:17] through things and we look at it from
[53:19] the wrong lens but God is here to give
[53:22] us his vision on the matter and so I'm
[53:24] certainly grateful for that and
[53:27] as I was
[53:29] pondering the the other message just
[53:31] seemed to just be so uh great for That
[53:35] season but I trust that maybe it'll just
[53:37] be a message for another time and so you
[53:40] know I just wanted to read out of a um
[53:43] message called God
[53:46] restoring the it's the restoration of
[53:49] the brid tree and this is mostly where
[53:53] I'll be pulling out of tonight so uh um
[53:56] I don't really have any other sermons
[53:59] that I'll pull out of that I don't
[54:00] believe but you know restoration is a is
[54:04] a very important thing and you know as
[54:08] as um you know one of the things that I
[54:10] do for a living is I do restoration work
[54:14] and so whenever there's a disaster or
[54:16] some kind of event that transpires or
[54:18] befalls a person you need sometimes if
[54:21] you have if you have a business or a
[54:23] home and there's fire wind hail or
[54:27] there's um you know tornadoes or or uh
[54:31] flooding you need to have a professional
[54:33] you need to have an expert you need
[54:35] somebody that could come and do the
[54:37] restoration for you somebody who knows
[54:39] what they're doing somebody who has
[54:41] experience and you're in a condition
[54:43] where you don't know all the ins and
[54:45] outs but there's somebody that if you
[54:46] could put confidence in them they can
[54:49] restore your property to previous
[54:51] condition before the storm happened
[54:53] before the fire happened before the
[54:55] water damage happened and you know if if
[54:58] that Restoration company can now realize
[55:02] owner of the insurance company it works
[55:04] according to the law the policy so if we
[55:06] could ever get on the same page if if
[55:09] the me being the contractor and them
[55:11] being the home owner if we can always
[55:13] just identify what is wrong with your
[55:15] home and say okay now do you have
[55:18] coverage is it in the policy is it
[55:20] written inside of the policy are you a
[55:24] benefactor of this loss do you see that
[55:27] yes there is evidence of a disaster I
[55:31] see mold I See Fire I see I see the
[55:34] evidence of something that was there but
[55:37] now when I go look in the
[55:40] policy does it have
[55:43] coverage you know a policy might have
[55:46] coverage but is your name on the top of
[55:49] the letter that says you're the holder
[55:51] of that
[55:53] policy you know so when we think about
[55:56] restoration we look at from two sides
[55:59] from the natural there's a restoration
[56:01] of things where um you know it it' be
[56:04] like a a disaster that came but you know
[56:07] as as I go through this message I don't
[56:11] want to take too much time going down
[56:14] these lines but because there's just so
[56:16] much I'd like to be able to express and
[56:19] I would encourage you to listen to this
[56:22] message the restoration of the brid tree
[56:24] you know it it if you try to listen it
[56:27] from top to bottom you're probably going
[56:29] to need at least four hours but you know
[56:32] this is a wonderful message and to think
[56:34] that God said that I will restore and it
[56:38] was something that God knew that this
[56:40] bride tree this tree of life that had
[56:43] been it been chipped down and been cut
[56:47] down to a stump but God said through
[56:50] Joel he said I will restore
[56:54] right and and we realiz realiz that God
[56:57] is a god of
[56:59] restoration you
[57:01] know so as we go through we realize
[57:03] there was you know if if we become born
[57:07] again now we're entitled to everything
[57:11] that was lost in the
[57:13] garden by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:16] we are entitled to every single promise
[57:18] in the
[57:20] book I just love that you know brother
[57:23] brandham says this in in paragraph 82
[57:26] says to restore means to return to the
[57:28] former owner to bring back to a former
[57:32] estate of condition and we we can
[57:36] enforce a claim to
[57:39] restore oh my just think about it you're
[57:42] a policy holder when you have the Life
[57:44] of Christ in you you become a policy
[57:47] holder if the devil has come and take
[57:50] the privilege of being a son or daughter
[57:53] of God you have the right to say Satan
[57:55] give it back
[57:57] God has placed such a love in my heart
[57:59] to see what he did at
[58:01] Calvary he shed his
[58:05] blood and that blood is a worthy
[58:08] atonement to bridge the gap between God
[58:11] I mean when I look back in the The
[58:13] Genesis and see the account I see that
[58:16] God said I will put enity there would be
[58:19] one come that would atone for my sin for
[58:21] the sin of humanity right praise God
[58:25] that's right oh what a fellowship what a
[58:28] restoration to come into fellowship and
[58:30] communion with God like he's always
[58:33] desired we never knew what that was like
[58:37] but God said I will restore all that the
[58:40] Palmer worm ate the canker worm at the
[58:44] Locust and the caterpillar oh my you
[58:47] think about this great bug and brother
[58:49] Bram taught it's the same selfs same bug
[58:52] just in different
[58:54] stages my think he's just eating at the
[58:57] tree you know we just my just to think
[59:01] about restoration coming back to that
[59:03] position as a Son of God you know when
[59:06] we were born into this world we were
[59:07] born as sons and daughters but we needed
[59:11] restoration we were in a fallen
[59:13] condition oh you know what that's my toy
[59:16] Mommy and it's Johnny's toy you know we
[59:19] had this nature it was a lying nature it
[59:22] was a stealing
[59:24] nature but oh God
[59:26] he cared so much that he said I will
[59:30] restore oh my goodness what a fellowship
[59:33] what a
[59:34] God my to restore means to bring back
[59:38] restore a claim can be enforced now to
[59:42] bring anything back to its rightful
[59:45] owner where it belongs therefore some
[59:50] way it went away from the rightful owner
[59:54] and can wander around anywhere but to
[59:57] restore is to bring it
[59:59] back to it who really owns
[1:00:04] it or to bring it back to its natural
[1:00:08] condition in order to do this we have a
[1:00:12] right to
[1:00:14] enforce if there is a law to enforce
[1:00:19] this rightful condition of restoration
[1:00:21] to
[1:00:22] restore okay praise the Lord now we have
[1:00:26] these rights to restore and now it'd be
[1:00:30] like if somebody got something stolen
[1:00:33] brother Bram tells the testimony of the
[1:00:35] brother where they got the car stolen
[1:00:37] right and so he he saw Vision so that's
[1:00:41] different for us because unless you see
[1:00:43] Visions you know but we have the word of
[1:00:45] promis that if there's two any two that
[1:00:49] come together and agree on one thing and
[1:00:53] it's the will of the lord we know that
[1:00:55] we have it we can call the great
[1:00:57] enforcer we can make our claim we can
[1:00:59] get down in prayer and agree together
[1:01:02] and the Holy Spirit which is the
[1:01:04] enforcer can come and restore our claim
[1:01:07] but we this is our
[1:01:09] inheritance it's your inheritance to
[1:01:12] make their claim if there's sickness you
[1:01:15] can call upon God for healing by his
[1:01:17] stripes I'm
[1:01:19] Healed if you have children that are
[1:01:23] Wayward it's for your house you have the
[1:01:26] right by a child of God being restored
[1:01:30] all of Heaven's willing to back you up
[1:01:33] if you will just re ask for
[1:01:36] restoration bring it back bring it
[1:01:42] back 88 says enforce then we are the the
[1:01:48] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[1:01:51] claim that God gave us for God has a law
[1:01:54] and his law is his word is his law and
[1:01:59] God in this word made certain claims to
[1:02:04] the church therefore we have the right
[1:02:06] to force these claims upon Satan give it
[1:02:08] back
[1:02:10] amen 89 says but the law of the spirit
[1:02:14] of God is to force Satan to give up that
[1:02:19] which is unrightfully and deceitfully
[1:02:22] taken from God Souls of man he took from
[1:02:26] God Souls of women Souls of children
[1:02:29] sickness of the body oh my we just want
[1:02:34] to encourage your heart with a little
[1:02:35] bit of what God wanted to restore in
[1:02:37] your life gets me
[1:02:41] excited oh there's going to be some
[1:02:43] praise some hearts of the Believers
[1:02:46] right around the corner you're going to
[1:02:47] say you know what I see my moment I see
[1:02:50] my
[1:02:51] opportunity it's coming
[1:03:00] my thank the
[1:03:03] Lord I'm sorry I'm getting so excited
[1:03:06] right now I'm going try to calm
[1:03:09] down he says
[1:03:15] this we're going to jump over there to
[1:03:17] 93 it says now so then we have the
[1:03:20] scripture here that Jesus
[1:03:22] said wheresoever two or more gather in
[1:03:26] my name and if they agree they'll be
[1:03:29] I'll be in their midst and if they will
[1:03:31] agree touching in one certain thing and
[1:03:34] ask it but don't doubt it they shall
[1:03:38] have what they ask and it'll be given to
[1:03:40] them now there's the
[1:03:43] law now the one that's here to enforce
[1:03:48] the law is the holy
[1:03:50] spirit how about the people who don't
[1:03:53] believe the Holy Spirit would reject him
[1:03:57] see you're rejecting your own peace and
[1:04:00] mercy my my but that's not this house of
[1:04:04] God
[1:04:11] Amen in paragraph 101 he says now the
[1:04:14] only way he can work is when you let him
[1:04:20] work you imagine if I'm over there and
[1:04:22] this has happened I've I've come and I'm
[1:04:24] helping a policy holder homeowner or
[1:04:26] something and all of a sudden they're
[1:04:27] making all this emotional bid because
[1:04:30] they have this great loss but if they
[1:04:32] don't have coverage it's like arguing at
[1:04:35] a wall it's like you're not going to get
[1:04:37] anywhere and so it's like this if if we
[1:04:40] if we want to have God have fruit in our
[1:04:44] lives and work the works of God we only
[1:04:48] way he can work is when we let him work
[1:04:51] we can't be fighting against God we
[1:04:54] can't be arguing point of our opinion
[1:04:56] and what we think about the matter but
[1:04:59] God has a law and that's his word so if
[1:05:01] we just take his word in our heart God
[1:05:03] will bring it to
[1:05:06] pass he said see you're you've got to
[1:05:09] believe it every promise in the word of
[1:05:12] God is yours but it's upon Condition You
[1:05:15] Must Believe it sir you must take it in
[1:05:18] your heart as your profession and your
[1:05:21] possession this is mine Satan Take Your
[1:05:24] Filthy Hands off of my this is my
[1:05:27] promise this is my God he's brought me
[1:05:30] into fellowship with
[1:05:34] him now he's talking about the fish and
[1:05:37] the fish has a certain law but see if he
[1:05:39] just goes and tries to hold his breath
[1:05:41] he would be working counter there's the
[1:05:43] law is already in him see he says now in
[1:05:46] 103 he says and that's the law of Christ
[1:05:50] the law that law is in men you can bury
[1:05:54] them in the deepest grave in the deepest
[1:05:56] sea and the lowest hell there's a law of
[1:05:58] the spirit that'll rise him up again oh
[1:06:01] my I just think about the restoration oh
[1:06:04] my God has things that we're going
[1:06:08] through right now we can't do it but
[1:06:10] he's saying I will I will restore you
[1:06:14] have relationships that are broken God's
[1:06:16] saying I will restore don't look at your
[1:06:19] circumstance don't look at the
[1:06:21] situations believe my word I will
[1:06:24] restore
[1:06:26] that's my word to you than Lord receive
[1:06:30] it
[1:06:32] tonight it's the law of the spirit of
[1:06:34] God in men and women and
[1:06:38] children Hallelujah I am not going to go
[1:06:42] as far as I thought I
[1:06:47] was now in 105 it says this he says now
[1:06:50] I'm beginning to feel religious now we
[1:06:52] have a law the law of the life in US we
[1:06:55] don't only thing you have to
[1:06:59] do you are made and born a place here in
[1:07:03] the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters
[1:07:05] of God you don't have to knock down to
[1:07:08] the devil we've got a law that law is
[1:07:11] the holy spirit is of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:14] the only thing you need to
[1:07:16] know is H have to do is to know how to
[1:07:22] let go and let
[1:07:24] God to to keep fighting at it see you'll
[1:07:28] never work it'll never work you have to
[1:07:31] know how to let go and let God God this
[1:07:34] is your
[1:07:36] word you're able to keep your word I'm
[1:07:38] going to let go I'm not going to try to
[1:07:40] force an outcome you are going to
[1:07:42] perform your word however you want I
[1:07:45] just believe it and I'm going to praise
[1:07:47] you now for
[1:07:54] it oh God thank you
[1:07:59] see says um you know the birds say and
[1:08:03] this 107 he says I'll see how fast I can
[1:08:06] run down there and maybe take off no you
[1:08:09] won't do it you'll fall down see he's
[1:08:13] got to learn how to control how that the
[1:08:16] law can control him my you know it's
[1:08:20] part of our nature we want to have
[1:08:21] control but you need to learn to let God
[1:08:25] let go and let God hallu let go of the
[1:08:29] control Oh you mean I have to put faith
[1:08:32] in God Amen that's where God's bringing
[1:08:36] us to he's restoring us to faith in God
[1:08:39] we're not to depend upon ourselves for
[1:08:42] anything you know it's the mercies of
[1:08:45] God that he's bringing these realities
[1:08:47] to us thank God
[1:08:56] amen see he says now then he takes you
[1:08:59] to your healing he takes you to the
[1:09:01] baptism of the Holy Spirit and anything
[1:09:04] that he promised isn't that
[1:09:08] wonderful any claim that he give you is
[1:09:11] yours by letting go and letting God
[1:09:16] hallelujah hallelujah now 10 112 he says
[1:09:21] what is it there's been a sentence a
[1:09:23] claim Easter claim or the flower claims
[1:09:26] it has a right to rise again and see
[1:09:29] God's law of nature pulls the Earth
[1:09:33] around to make the law of God in nature
[1:09:37] to bring forth an Easter a resurrection
[1:09:41] it's
[1:09:41] beautifully the return of the sun to
[1:09:45] restore what the winter killed while it
[1:09:49] was from the
[1:09:51] earth he sends the Earth back around the
[1:09:54] Sun and we're told that way back there
[1:09:58] the earth the earth went away from the
[1:10:01] sun went back there and that's the way
[1:10:04] the sinner does he goes away from the S
[1:10:07] so n and when this Su
[1:10:11] n but when the when it strikes when this
[1:10:15] Earth begins to come
[1:10:17] back when it's out there death strikes
[1:10:20] it it's winter it kills everything
[1:10:22] living thing that it can kill out there
[1:10:25] there now when the earth gets back
[1:10:28] around the seeds laying in the ground
[1:10:30] they're frozen the pulp run out of them
[1:10:32] and everything is gone but there's a
[1:10:35] little life
[1:10:36] preserved and as soon as the sun brings
[1:10:39] back into the position the Earth again
[1:10:43] then there's an Easter a
[1:10:47] resurrection up comes the flowers up
[1:10:50] comes everything all that the winter
[1:10:53] killed the sun restored
[1:10:56] all that the Winter's death killed the
[1:11:00] sun brings the life and restores the son
[1:11:04] of life restores oh I think that's
[1:11:07] wonderful you see the natural the sun
[1:11:11] because the Earth is on is going away
[1:11:13] and then there there's there's a winter
[1:11:15] and everything's dying off you can see
[1:11:17] now the sun is
[1:11:19] returning there's an Easter hallelujah
[1:11:22] and if if it's happening in in in our
[1:11:25] natural Realms around us we're in the
[1:11:27] season of
[1:11:31] restoration start throwing Waters
[1:11:33] everywhere
[1:11:40] sorry now in 15 it says and so it is
[1:11:44] with the people so it is now with the
[1:11:47] people all that the winners coldness of
[1:11:50] cold former religion killed out there
[1:11:53] and the nearing of the Son of God in the
[1:11:55] last days comes into his church and
[1:11:57] restores it back to life again I will
[1:12:00] restore Hallelujah sayeth the Lord see
[1:12:05] God restores the flowers the leaves his
[1:12:08] nature his seeds of the earth and
[1:12:12] therefore we know then that God will
[1:12:15] restore also his habitation he will
[1:12:19] restore his Eve that's right he will
[1:12:21] restore everything that death killed
[1:12:24] that's right now the only way it can
[1:12:27] ever remain
[1:12:28] dead is to let it lay in the wrong place
[1:12:34] on my my my but if it falls in the right
[1:12:38] place hallelujah it's got to come back
[1:12:41] to life
[1:12:43] again so God let us fall in the right
[1:12:46] channel that's right for a restoration
[1:12:49] hallelujah oh my don't let me get caught
[1:12:51] up in my own thinking and unbelief but
[1:12:54] let me fall in the channel of faith in
[1:12:56] your word because I know that your word
[1:12:58] will bring life amen the resurrection in
[1:13:03] life my all the winter kills the sun
[1:13:09] restores returning of the Sun what does
[1:13:13] it do it forces it it forces death when
[1:13:17] the sun the spring Sun comes back in
[1:13:21] line with the Earth it actually forces
[1:13:24] death to give up the dead to a
[1:13:27] resurrection for what a resurrection a
[1:13:30] restoration to restore
[1:13:33] again what does it the sun
[1:13:39] coming that's God's
[1:13:41] law God set the Earth in law
[1:13:45] gravitational law everything in nature
[1:13:48] Works according to God's law the flower
[1:13:51] serves its term and the seed serves its
[1:13:53] term it dies in into the Earth it's dead
[1:13:57] into the Earth and then there is a
[1:14:00] restoration oh how beautiful God laid it
[1:14:04] so plain in nature his laws and
[1:14:06] everything to serve his
[1:14:09] purpose
[1:14:14] my 118 he says now it's laying there
[1:14:18] dead and there's not a thing we could
[1:14:21] take one of them here lights like this
[1:14:23] and turn it on and it'll never never do
[1:14:25] any good there's no way for us to do it
[1:14:29] but God has a law and that when the sun
[1:14:33] comes unto the seed it forces the life
[1:14:36] out of the seed death can't hold it
[1:14:39] anymore now God has set his
[1:14:42] law now God set all of his laws to serve
[1:14:46] him both natural and spiritual working
[1:14:49] according to his word regardless of the
[1:14:52] conditions oh my goodness
[1:14:55] oh my goodness well we make a lot of
[1:14:58] excuses for conditions don't we but oh
[1:15:01] my God saying you know what don't look
[1:15:03] at your condition Hallelujah despite the
[1:15:06] condition despite anything God's word he
[1:15:09] said I'll
[1:15:13] restore says now yes God set all of the
[1:15:17] laws in motion think of it let this soak
[1:15:20] cuz we're coming to a healing service in
[1:15:21] a few minutes God set all of his laws in
[1:15:24] motion
[1:15:25] and it must work according to his own
[1:15:27] word are you getting it see his word his
[1:15:30] law has to work according to his word he
[1:15:34] commanded the sun he commanded the moon
[1:15:36] he commanded the Earth he commanded
[1:15:40] nature and they all fall right in line
[1:15:43] and all the laws work in harmony with
[1:15:45] God's spoken word and the law of life
[1:15:48] that is within us will bring us to a
[1:15:51] resurrection Hallelujah there it is
[1:15:55] the law of life is in
[1:15:57] you oh
[1:16:03] my and
[1:16:05] that's now it's impossible for it not
[1:16:09] and that's the reason the law of life
[1:16:11] that was in Christ when the word was
[1:16:14] spoken he says I will not leave my soul
[1:16:17] and my Holy One to see corruption
[1:16:19] neither will I leave his soul in Hell
[1:16:21] there wasn't enough time there's wasn't
[1:16:25] enough Devils there wasn't enough
[1:16:28] anything to keep Christ in the grave
[1:16:31] till his body got to R because the law
[1:16:36] would bring the word to pass the law of
[1:16:39] God brought by the Holy Spirit brings
[1:16:42] any promise to pass regardless of the
[1:16:45] condition job said though the skin worms
[1:16:48] destroy my body yet in my flesh I shall
[1:16:51] see God oh my regardless of how little
[1:16:55] you are I
[1:16:58] qualify regardless how low you are I
[1:17:01] qualify regardless how you are or how
[1:17:04] Unholy you are how sick you are how
[1:17:07] Afflicted you are the law of God's
[1:17:10] spirit by his word makes it obey him
[1:17:14] forces the issue give it back right oh
[1:17:19] amen and if we could ever just think
[1:17:22] that for a moment regardless forces
[1:17:25] regardless of the condition no matter
[1:17:28] what the condition is the law of God
[1:17:31] forces the condition to cope with his
[1:17:35] word it's got to oh I love that I love
[1:17:40] that praise God you know it's just
[1:17:43] amazing see sometimes it says this in
[1:17:45] 129 says sometimes people get so guilty
[1:17:48] minded he
[1:17:50] says that they won't want to face
[1:17:53] judgment you get that you you know some
[1:17:56] people like they start running and doing
[1:17:58] their different things they just they
[1:18:00] just can't accept I I don't want to and
[1:18:02] so you know it's like the kid that's
[1:18:03] whistling in the graveyard but he knows
[1:18:05] judgment's coming yeah you know and here
[1:18:08] we are saying Lord oh my and many people
[1:18:13] it ain't too hard to die anything
[1:18:16] anybody loose there can lose their mind
[1:18:19] and something again and do something
[1:18:21] rational some of them have their bodies
[1:18:24] burned and take them to the Sea and
[1:18:25] throw them into the ashes of the four
[1:18:27] corners and things The Winds of the sea
[1:18:30] that don't stop
[1:18:32] judgment see you come right on just the
[1:18:36] same yes sir see no matter regardless of
[1:18:39] the condition you're going to meet God
[1:18:44] somewhere we're going to meet God
[1:18:47] somewhere you've got to come to him
[1:18:50] you've got to meet him see because
[1:18:54] why he has spoke a word and put a law in
[1:18:58] his word and the law is his own law he
[1:19:03] his own law his own life behind it
[1:19:06] that's the reason why he swore by
[1:19:08] himself there's none greater see he had
[1:19:11] to take an oath because no Covenant
[1:19:14] should be confirmed without an oath and
[1:19:16] the only way that he
[1:19:19] could before he did take it by
[1:19:23] himself and himself become the
[1:19:26] oath oh brother when God became man and
[1:19:30] was the oath he made himself an
[1:19:35] oath and by his own death burial and
[1:19:39] Resurrection he proved his law was right
[1:19:42] Hallelujah Glory oh
[1:19:45] my you destroy this building and I'll
[1:19:48] raise it up again in three days I
[1:19:51] personal pronoun I will raise it up
[1:19:54] again in 3 days I'll bring it up try to
[1:19:57] destroy it see what happens for he knew
[1:20:01] the law of God glory you know the
[1:20:04] prophet of God said that Jesus only had
[1:20:07] one scripture that he can base the
[1:20:08] Resurrection on but he said right here
[1:20:11] he said for he knew the law of God and
[1:20:15] he got in Channel with the word of God
[1:20:17] oh
[1:20:18] Hallelujah Lord help me then the law of
[1:20:22] God has got to work by the work
[1:20:25] we're coming down in a great little
[1:20:28] thing in a minute where the law of God's
[1:20:31] word the law of God is with his
[1:20:34] word my I'm GNA have to skip some I'm
[1:20:37] trying to get somewhere Lord help
[1:20:41] me feeling
[1:20:43] okay God wants to restore many things
[1:20:47] all things
[1:20:50] Hallelujah he says this in 148 he says
[1:20:54] God is speak speaking of his fruit tree
[1:20:56] now God he wanted to have a fruit tree
[1:20:58] and he planted it the day of Pentecost
[1:21:00] and there it's been chopped down to a
[1:21:03] stump and We Know by prophecy that Joel
[1:21:05] said I will restore all that this bug
[1:21:08] had ate down he says God is speaking of
[1:21:11] that fruit tree that he had planted God
[1:21:13] planted that fruit his a fruit tree he
[1:21:17] planted it at the day of Pentecost and
[1:21:19] he brought that tree there for a purpose
[1:21:25] he wanted now this is the desire he
[1:21:27] wanted to bear his
[1:21:31] fruit the God's word he wanted a church
[1:21:34] that would keep his word all down
[1:21:37] through the age Eve failed to keep it
[1:21:39] the Jews failed to keep it the law had
[1:21:41] failed all of the all had failed so God
[1:21:45] planted him a tree a
[1:21:47] tree now if we'll skrip to verse 150 I'm
[1:21:51] sorry for doing this but I I just
[1:21:53] encourage you to take the time and
[1:21:54] listen to this because I am no
[1:21:57] substitute for the source but now when
[1:22:00] the tree of of uh uh now when this tree
[1:22:04] that God planted it was to Bear nine
[1:22:07] different kinds of fruit nine different
[1:22:10] kinds which means nine spiritual gifts
[1:22:13] nine fruit of the spirit to go with the
[1:22:16] nine spiritual gifts this was God's tree
[1:22:19] he planted it on Earth at the day of
[1:22:22] Pentecost praise God praise God we just
[1:22:25] start thinking of just brother brandom
[1:22:27] just runs right into Psalms 1 like a
[1:22:29] tree that's planted and he says that
[1:22:32] like a tree that's planted in by the
[1:22:34] rivers of water it's it's going to bring
[1:22:38] forth fruit in its season amen he says
[1:22:40] this and now this is in 164 he says but
[1:22:43] a man that's planted not stuck out but
[1:22:45] planted by the rivers of water he shall
[1:22:48] bring forth his fruit
[1:22:51] watch he and his his fruit in his season
[1:22:57] are you reading it Psalms 1 he says
[1:22:59] blessed is the man that sth not in the
[1:23:01] seat of the scorn for standeth in the
[1:23:02] way of
[1:23:03] Sinners he shall be like a tree that is
[1:23:06] planted by the rivers of water he shall
[1:23:09] bring forth his fruit in his season and
[1:23:13] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper see
[1:23:15] notice the ungodly not so he won't stand
[1:23:19] with him in the Judgment my my see now
[1:23:24] he shall bring forth his fruit in his
[1:23:27] season watch each his the personal
[1:23:30] pronoun there it's his fruit God's fruit
[1:23:35] in the season that the prophet is
[1:23:37] bringing it it'll be the prophet season
[1:23:42] God's fruit In God's Time by The Prophet
[1:23:46] season oh God thank you now he shall
[1:23:51] bring forth his fruit in his season
[1:23:54] there isn't to his there bring forth his
[1:24:00] God's fruit in his season that the
[1:24:03] messenger is ordained to come he'll
[1:24:05] bring forth those now remember that the
[1:24:09] Messenger will bring the fruit of God
[1:24:12] will bring it in God's season in the
[1:24:15] season of the bringer see he will bring
[1:24:17] forth the fruit in his season and he C
[1:24:21] and it cannot wither
[1:24:25] he's got predestinated fruit there it
[1:24:28] can't it can't destroy it because it's
[1:24:32] predestinated Amen oh I love that praise
[1:24:36] the Lord we're going to have to keep
[1:24:38] progressing
[1:24:39] here see it says
[1:24:43] now in 169 all trees by the woman died
[1:24:47] we all die by The Woman by birth we all
[1:24:51] die but through woman come death
[1:24:54] but this Birth come by but this Birth
[1:24:58] come by women all right then it has to
[1:25:02] die because of sin but the birth the new
[1:25:04] birth that comes by Christ cannot die
[1:25:07] that's the one tree and the other see
[1:25:11] this tree though it is persecuted made
[1:25:14] fun of and
[1:25:16] everything the very beginning of the
[1:25:18] Garden of Eden it cannot die it's
[1:25:21] predestinated it's been clubbed it's
[1:25:23] been beaten oh my everything done to it
[1:25:26] and what happened it cannot die his he
[1:25:30] will not die he can't because he's
[1:25:34] holding in him the predestinated word of
[1:25:37] God it has to come forth for his fruit
[1:25:40] is in his season predestinated SE season
[1:25:45] Joel saw one of them at the bottom and
[1:25:49] he said I will restore sayeth the Lord
[1:25:51] for the predestinated of God let in the
[1:25:54] roots of the tree I've cut down some
[1:25:57] trees before and they went down to a
[1:25:59] stump I'm
[1:26:00] like job's
[1:26:03] completed but oh my next year there's
[1:26:05] all of these saplings coming up I'm like
[1:26:09] man got humbled you know you're like
[1:26:12] yeah but oh my think about it God had a
[1:26:16] predestinated attributes in the roots oh
[1:26:21] my my my my in 17 he says and then at
[1:26:25] Pentecost where the church for the bride
[1:26:28] tree he set it in order at Pentecost the
[1:26:31] tree was predestinated to bring forth
[1:26:34] fruit in its season now going fine and
[1:26:37] the fruits were going just fine it
[1:26:39] bloomed out at the day of Pentecost
[1:26:41] let's see what happened at Pentecost see
[1:26:44] Jesus said the works that I do shall you
[1:26:46] do also they healed the sick and that
[1:26:50] day that started there was 50 days after
[1:26:54] Easter and they came and a Russian
[1:26:55] Mighty Wind from Heaven oh my think
[1:26:59] about
[1:27:00] it and they spoke with tongues they went
[1:27:02] out preached the gospel and the
[1:27:05] spokesman came out came out and he
[1:27:07] preached the
[1:27:09] gospel now this says this in um 187
[1:27:13] notice now what had taken place on this
[1:27:17] God planted a tree to bring forth nine
[1:27:19] spiritual gifts gifts of his Spirit The
[1:27:22] Same Spirit was in Christ down come down
[1:27:26] upon the church had eternal life now the
[1:27:29] spirit the gifts of the Spirit was in
[1:27:31] the church and it was growing bearing
[1:27:34] forth
[1:27:35] fruit
[1:27:37] everywhere they thought not of
[1:27:42] theirselves they didn't organize nothing
[1:27:45] they just went ahead and was
[1:27:47] brothers and I'm glad that little thing
[1:27:50] was on there brother Brandon's pointing
[1:27:53] out to some something he says no Creed
[1:27:56] but Christ no law but love and no book
[1:27:59] but the Bible he says I believe that
[1:28:01] that's what I believe Amen in 192 it
[1:28:05] says this and there is the kind of sign
[1:28:07] that he said would follow the believer
[1:28:10] where is it
[1:28:11] today he gave the world an example of
[1:28:14] what would the believer
[1:28:17] sign he said it would be far better that
[1:28:21] you would a millstone hang at your neck
[1:28:23] and Dr round at the depths of the sea
[1:28:25] then to bring an offense to one of these
[1:28:28] and the angels always behold the face my
[1:28:30] father's face which is in heaven the
[1:28:32] Angels now notice there they were and
[1:28:36] they and that tree was planted it was
[1:28:40] doing great
[1:28:41] work and we know that and we know that
[1:28:45] went about everywhere why on the day of
[1:28:48] Pentecost 3,000 Souls were added
[1:28:51] baptized and went into the church and
[1:28:53] how Great Fellowship they had and
[1:28:55] everybody wasn't nobody needing anything
[1:28:59] everybody was kind and
[1:29:03] good-hearted and one another and they
[1:29:06] were all big one big family isn't that
[1:29:09] wonderful to think that that's what
[1:29:11] we're restored to you might look at it
[1:29:14] and say well I'm I'm recognizing that we
[1:29:16] need
[1:29:18] restoration but I'm here to tell you God
[1:29:21] promised restoration
[1:29:26] says and there came by a little
[1:29:31] ugly a little old ugly looking greedy
[1:29:35] teeth Beetle that lives in four
[1:29:38] different stages and Joe saw it four
[1:29:40] stages of an insect Destroyer came forth
[1:29:43] to destroy that beautiful tree of God
[1:29:46] think of it now I'm going to read off
[1:29:49] some of Joel and he said Joel in the
[1:29:51] first chapter he says now there was four
[1:29:54] different beetles there but there's
[1:29:57] actually ju it's just one one beetle in
[1:30:00] four stages now watch this little Beetle
[1:30:02] come by for great be for this great
[1:30:07] beautiful tree of God and we we call it
[1:30:11] a tree which was the church so this tree
[1:30:15] is the restoration of the Bride tree now
[1:30:19] the first was a Palmer worm and that's a
[1:30:23] little thing just a little bitty insect
[1:30:25] of a worm are you catching this there
[1:30:29] was a Palmer worm he was just a little
[1:30:31] worm and he went and attacked this tree
[1:30:34] and he brought destruction and
[1:30:36] Devastation in the form and in the
[1:30:39] season of a Palmer work he says he come
[1:30:42] along to destroy the fruit of the
[1:30:45] tree that was the first thing now let's
[1:30:48] go back in history and see this first
[1:30:50] thing was a dignified group that God
[1:30:54] amongst the common people and they said
[1:30:57] well this is good you know called the
[1:31:01] heal the sick and do these things that's
[1:31:04] wonderful so you know we ought to do we
[1:31:06] ought to get out there and get a bigger
[1:31:09] class of people and understand the
[1:31:12] better class the mayor the judges and
[1:31:14] carry and and the dignitaries of the
[1:31:17] city and as long as you carry on that
[1:31:20] way you'll never come around you'll
[1:31:22] never come around they'll never come
[1:31:23] around around you and you know that was
[1:31:25] the way it was at at Pentecost at the
[1:31:27] Pentecost but we don't have to be
[1:31:29] inviting the mayor and different things
[1:31:31] but the these kind of attitudes I like
[1:31:33] how brother Paul was saying we want to
[1:31:35] discern the time in our attitudes like
[1:31:38] the all this stuff that's going on in
[1:31:40] Israel all I mean we're looking at you
[1:31:42] know uh they're just you know you look
[1:31:45] around and there's there's not hope for
[1:31:48] this system of the world our only hope
[1:31:50] is in the promises of God he said I will
[1:31:53] restore
[1:31:57] now we're going to jump over to uh 203
[1:31:59] it says this little Palmer worm came
[1:32:00] around and took up off all the fruits
[1:32:03] and I have two pages of fruit but just
[1:32:05] let's let's read some of them first
[1:32:07] thing he took off was brotherly love
[1:32:09] that's right the one thing that he that
[1:32:11] kills a church right there is on
[1:32:13] brotherly love yes sir then the next
[1:32:17] fruit that he took off remember love is
[1:32:19] the first fruit of the tree love joy
[1:32:21] peace longsuffering gentleness or
[1:32:24] goodness meekness Faith patience that's
[1:32:27] right in the Holy Ghost these are nine
[1:32:30] spiritual gifts with the nine fruits of
[1:32:32] the tree and so forth all right now the
[1:32:34] first he's got to eat on he got to eaten
[1:32:38] on the tree the fruit of the of the tree
[1:32:40] now let's picture this big tree God's
[1:32:43] tree bearing nine spiritual gifts they
[1:32:45] were Healing The Sick they were speaking
[1:32:47] in tongues they were casting out Devils
[1:32:49] they were doing great work Works
[1:32:52] preaching the unadulterated word of God
[1:32:54] no denomination to tie them down they
[1:32:56] were free doing a great work so in comes
[1:33:00] this little devil sitting up with two
[1:33:03] horns setting out in front like a
[1:33:05] grasshopper you know the little old
[1:33:07] gritty teeth this first little palm worm
[1:33:11] came
[1:33:12] out and ate off brotherly love he said
[1:33:15] you know so and so did so and so over at
[1:33:18] so and so
[1:33:20] church I wouldn't believe that bunch of
[1:33:22] people see
[1:33:25] there he is that's the first
[1:33:29] thing now the next thing he wanted to
[1:33:31] eat on was the fruit of faith faith in
[1:33:34] the word now look how do you know that
[1:33:37] it is the word it's been translated so
[1:33:40] many
[1:33:41] times you know that Devil's still
[1:33:45] eating he says he's this and that and
[1:33:48] the other oh
[1:33:50] my now the other fruit he ate off Joy of
[1:33:57] Salvation the fruit of Joy my you people
[1:34:01] make too much noise oh
[1:34:04] my oh you can you can preach brother
[1:34:06] brandom and that woman one time no it
[1:34:10] wasn't it was a man I believe he
[1:34:12] belonged to another church and he said
[1:34:14] to me he says my I can hear all those
[1:34:18] people crying you know I just think
[1:34:20] about it you know that's that's still
[1:34:22] attitudes that are are still living it's
[1:34:25] the Palmer worm he's still at work he's
[1:34:28] still chewing at the fruit of Brotherly
[1:34:32] Love he's still trying to eat the fruit
[1:34:35] of faith in God's word give you a reason
[1:34:39] your symptoms the doctor's
[1:34:42] diagnosis you you come from a family
[1:34:45] you're just not that smart you can't get
[1:34:47] that degree whatever it is he's still
[1:34:49] eating at it but faith in God's word oh
[1:34:54] my that's what we want to see God
[1:34:55] bringing restoration the joy of my
[1:34:58] salvation you know sometimes we can lose
[1:35:00] the joy of our Salvation that's because
[1:35:03] the Palmer worm is still at
[1:35:08] work my I
[1:35:14] better I might have
[1:35:17] to and then the next fruit is in uh 214
[1:35:21] now the next fruit of the tree is peace
[1:35:24] Peace of Mind knowing that I'm saved now
[1:35:28] they tell you well if you site recite a
[1:35:31] certain Creed you're saved if you join
[1:35:32] the church you're saved if one of these
[1:35:34] things you're saved if you go there if
[1:35:37] you join our church you're saved if you
[1:35:39] say a hell Mary if you put your name on
[1:35:41] the book you
[1:35:43] have oh that just takes all the joy
[1:35:47] away my think about it these stage these
[1:35:52] stages of this bug the Palmer worm was
[1:35:55] eating at the fruit now what's the next
[1:35:58] stage of this development of this
[1:36:01] palmerworm was the Locust and the Locust
[1:36:04] began to eat the leaves off the tree and
[1:36:07] as he was eating the leaves off of the
[1:36:10] tree all of a sudden we let the prophet
[1:36:14] tell
[1:36:14] us now this little Locust what the
[1:36:18] Palmer worm left now this is in I
[1:36:22] believe one or
[1:36:25] 222 he says and I'm jumping in the
[1:36:27] middle then look at it the Locust came
[1:36:30] to eat eat with the Palmer worm left see
[1:36:34] the to destroy the leaves what is the
[1:36:37] leaves for divine
[1:36:40] Fellowship my to think about it the
[1:36:43] devil's trying to come and destroy our
[1:36:46] divine
[1:36:48] Fellowship well I'm recognizing the
[1:36:51] devil in every one of his tricks that's
[1:36:53] right now he's Presbyterian we won't
[1:36:57] have anything to do with him he's
[1:36:59] Nazarene he's Pentecostal and this and
[1:37:01] that and the other we won't have nothing
[1:37:03] to do with him because he don't belong
[1:37:05] to our group oh my look at these little
[1:37:08] Spirits
[1:37:10] Devils we have a meeting here in The
[1:37:12] Healing The Sick oh the church don't
[1:37:14] believe in
[1:37:16] that there he is that's that old Locust
[1:37:20] do he cut off the fellowship off that's
[1:37:23] right he took the fellowship what is
[1:37:24] fellowship what does the leaves do makes
[1:37:28] it cool when the birds flying under the
[1:37:30] leaves to cool off my we're going to
[1:37:34] jump down to 227 but you know we're
[1:37:37] supposed to what we're supposed to do
[1:37:39] the Bible says the predestinated the
[1:37:41] predestinated sons of
[1:37:47] God set in Heavenly places what is that
[1:37:52] what is the predes inated setting in
[1:37:54] Heavenly places what is that to do it's
[1:37:58] coolness Comfort a feeling at
[1:38:03] home don't you love it don't you love
[1:38:05] God's word you can be yourself you're
[1:38:08] part of the family of God not because I
[1:38:11] say so but because God said
[1:38:15] so amen where anybody can wear a tuxedo
[1:38:19] suit a man oh my I can't I can't read
[1:38:22] all that sorry
[1:38:24] okay sure
[1:38:26] can where anybody wearing a tuxedo suit
[1:38:29] and the next man on the way the other of
[1:38:32] this oh look she never got a permanent
[1:38:34] in her hair don't she look horrible she
[1:38:38] don't even have an Easter frown a gown
[1:38:41] on
[1:38:43] now whatever it was you know Easter
[1:38:47] frown that's about right sat back there
[1:38:50] going and brother brandom illustrates
[1:38:52] something but he says
[1:38:54] don't even have Easter Easter gown
[1:38:58] well look at him that old same suit he
[1:39:02] wore last year well what do you know
[1:39:05] about
[1:39:07] that you don't even feel right
[1:39:11] there I said to a little lady the other
[1:39:14] day a poor little woman she belonged to
[1:39:16] a great dignified Church she said she
[1:39:20] was dying with cancer went down to pray
[1:39:23] for her brother Roy Roberson there and
[1:39:26] one of the trustees went down there and
[1:39:28] the poor little woman was sitting there
[1:39:30] dying with cancer and she said I said do
[1:39:35] you are you a Christian she said sir I
[1:39:39] don't know what to say said I went to a
[1:39:41] certain church and said she started
[1:39:45] crying I said what's the matter she said
[1:39:49] I just couldn't dress right said they
[1:39:52] looked down and
[1:39:53] me there you
[1:39:56] are you're uncomfortable
[1:39:59] see but the Bible said that we would
[1:40:02] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[1:40:04] places oh my what all
[1:40:08] alike why I'll tell you what Heavenly
[1:40:11] place I'll tell you what to do I'll make
[1:40:15] it'll make a pair of overhauls in a
[1:40:17] tuxedo suit put her arms around one
[1:40:20] another and call each other brother oh
[1:40:24] my that's what leaves
[1:40:25] do my can you recognize the Locust at
[1:40:30] work eating at the
[1:40:32] leaves my he still had work but God said
[1:40:35] he would ReStore in one and 234 he says
[1:40:38] but the third stage of him was this
[1:40:41] cankerworm
[1:40:43] H so now he's got a bad name to start
[1:40:46] with canker cankerworm what does a
[1:40:49] cankerworm do he goes into the bark
[1:40:52] that's his lifeline
[1:40:54] there
[1:40:58] my yes sir he goes into the bark and
[1:41:01] destroys the covering the covering what
[1:41:04] is religion covering what does the word
[1:41:07] religion mean a
[1:41:09] covering so the little cankerworm after
[1:41:12] he got amongst the congregation got all
[1:41:15] dignified and they took all the
[1:41:17] fellowship away with them and in the
[1:41:20] form of a locust and now he comes around
[1:41:23] and takes the very religion and makes
[1:41:25] dogmas out of it set up some Orthodox
[1:41:28] word forms himself a religion and gets a
[1:41:31] bunch of men together and puts a Creed
[1:41:33] down there and takes the very religion
[1:41:35] and strips off the tree of God the very
[1:41:38] bark that bears the sap that comes into
[1:41:41] it takes it away cankerworm do you see
[1:41:44] that insect that's exactly right that
[1:41:47] canker worm that was Rome in the early
[1:41:52] church he
[1:41:59] amen my think about the fruit being
[1:42:03] eaten off the leaves now the bark what
[1:42:06] is the
[1:42:08] Bark I mean we're students of the
[1:42:10] message but I think it's good to just
[1:42:12] stir Your Hearts Up by remembrance you
[1:42:14] know we want to see how God because he's
[1:42:16] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:42:18] so if God did this at Pentecost and he
[1:42:21] said I will restore
[1:42:23] the condition of Heart of his believing
[1:42:25] children we want to know how the enemy
[1:42:28] works because that's all part of our
[1:42:29] overcoming that's all part of putting
[1:42:32] this thing subject to
[1:42:39] this
[1:42:42] m in 238 says that's the way we're
[1:42:46] Christians not by joining into a group
[1:42:48] that's an organization we're born
[1:42:51] Christians
[1:42:53] being regenerated by the Holy Ghost
[1:42:56] notice now when this little cankerworm
[1:42:58] began to bore itself into the bark what
[1:43:00] did it do it began to take its religion
[1:43:03] its covering the doctrine away from
[1:43:07] it now religion is Doctrine and a
[1:43:11] covering that covers anything that's the
[1:43:13] reason our religion is by
[1:43:16] Blood the blood the life is in the blood
[1:43:21] that covers the word the life is in it's
[1:43:25] in the blood the blood is the religion
[1:43:29] and the life in the blood is what brings
[1:43:31] the results why you see it
[1:43:35] amen it's not covered by fig
[1:43:38] leaves my
[1:43:42] my we're going to go
[1:43:47] to 246 God sent the Holy Ghost the life
[1:43:52] of God
[1:43:53] to be in you not in a statue you're the
[1:43:57] guy that God wants to live in not a
[1:43:59] statue but in
[1:44:03] you God's people holy
[1:44:06] statutes there's ain't no holy statute
[1:44:10] you're the holy statute the Bible said
[1:44:13] so a body thou H has prepared me now
[1:44:16] this little fellow started destroying
[1:44:19] destroying what the cankerworm got into
[1:44:21] the bark and watch he began to destroy
[1:44:22] the
[1:44:23] bark what did he do he made the church
[1:44:27] spiritual he made a natural church for a
[1:44:30] spiritual
[1:44:33] church yes sir he took away all of the
[1:44:36] true and just gave a false now remember
[1:44:40] the fruit of the Palmer worm the fruit
[1:44:42] Palmer worm the leaf the Locust the bark
[1:44:45] the covering the religion the doctrine
[1:44:47] the doctrine to cankerworm God and
[1:44:52] there where did the first Doctrine come
[1:44:55] from out of the Bible you historians you
[1:44:57] know where it come from from Rome
[1:45:00] exactly where it started there's where
[1:45:03] they started accepting dogmas
[1:45:07] my God determined that his Bible would
[1:45:10] be
[1:45:11] written I'm jumping around a little bit
[1:45:14] here now but the water baptism there was
[1:45:17] the commission that was what the
[1:45:19] doctrine was at the beginning he said
[1:45:21] men and Brethren what must we do to be
[1:45:23] saved he said repent every one of you
[1:45:26] and be baptized that was the original
[1:45:28] tree that was the one that brought that
[1:45:31] was their
[1:45:32] doctrine that was by the word of
[1:45:35] God and it was Upon This
[1:45:38] Rock
[1:45:40] my we're going to try to run here 264 he
[1:45:44] says so you see the cankerworm got to
[1:45:46] eating eating away the baptism of water
[1:45:49] in the name of Jesus the next thing the
[1:45:51] cankerworm did is take away the baptism
[1:45:53] of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:56] my if you ain't got your Doctrine right
[1:45:59] how you going to cope up with the word
[1:46:00] of God if you got some Creed write your
[1:46:03] name on a book take a Eucharist and
[1:46:05] believe all this nonsense it'll never
[1:46:08] bring the results but if we take the
[1:46:10] unadulterated word and we do what it
[1:46:12] says if you haven't been baptized and
[1:46:15] you're on the fence God wants to restore
[1:46:18] to you what he promised
[1:46:25] it's going to shed light on that word as
[1:46:28] long as you do that that's what the Holy
[1:46:30] Ghost will
[1:46:31] do 267 he says but what did it do that's
[1:46:37] what the cankerworm did it took away the
[1:46:39] spirit and gave him a piece of bread my
[1:46:42] gave him a handshake gave him a piece of
[1:46:44] bread now instead of the word the
[1:46:48] cankerworm gave him a Creed do you see
[1:46:50] it see he gave a natural for Spiritual
[1:46:53] can you see it now look we're on the
[1:46:57] Catholic line here but did you know that
[1:47:01] right down there the Protestant
[1:47:04] 2 where do they have the Holy Ghost
[1:47:08] demonstrations in Protestant churches
[1:47:10] today where do they have the Pentecostal
[1:47:13] reactions among the Protestants they
[1:47:16] don't have it you have it in Lutheran no
[1:47:19] you don't if you do I want to go to it I
[1:47:22] want the Presbyterians where where is it
[1:47:25] at they've adopted something natural I'm
[1:47:28] fixing to leave you and you know that
[1:47:31] see don't
[1:47:33] never let this get out of your
[1:47:37] heart I believe brother Brandon's trying
[1:47:39] to lay a key here that this is what the
[1:47:43] devil wants to do is give you a natural
[1:47:45] just go to church pay your time just
[1:47:47] just have your routine with God that's
[1:47:50] just
[1:47:51] natural but God God says don't brother
[1:47:54] br's admonish is don't just take the
[1:47:56] natural the natural's
[1:47:59] death Shake
[1:48:01] ourselves don't take the natural that's
[1:48:04] death the natural man is death anything
[1:48:07] it does it's death it's subject here for
[1:48:10] death it's the spirit that maketh alive
[1:48:12] see the spirit gives us life it's
[1:48:14] Quicken it amen they took the water
[1:48:17] baptism and put it in Father Son and
[1:48:19] Holy Ghost my now I'm really gonna have
[1:48:23] to try to
[1:48:25] run now this is in 282 now watch here's
[1:48:29] a good
[1:48:31] one I'll get this one and then I'll stop
[1:48:34] and look now the Bible tells us when
[1:48:36] we've done wrong we should Purge our
[1:48:39] souls by the Holy Ghost get down and let
[1:48:43] the Holy Spirit reveal to us you're
[1:48:45] doing
[1:48:46] wrong and stay there before him and die
[1:48:51] out and Purge our
[1:48:53] souls now they're turning it around and
[1:48:57] giving you
[1:48:59] Purgatory after you're dead and then the
[1:49:02] priest makes a lot of money and prays
[1:49:04] you out of purgatory why
[1:49:06] nonsense why the natural for a
[1:49:13] spiritual 13 or 311 now here he comes
[1:49:18] the caterpillar the fourth stage of him
[1:49:21] the caterpillar all he he's a sucker he
[1:49:23] sucks the life the spirit the life
[1:49:27] that's what he
[1:49:29] does gets right down holds the
[1:49:33] pulp and gets to sucking the caterpillar
[1:49:37] there he
[1:49:39] is who we going to call him
[1:49:43] denomination that's the guy's name he's
[1:49:46] a destroyer sucks the life every time
[1:49:49] that God sends a move among the people
[1:49:51] every time they deny domate right there
[1:49:55] they die I want somebody who knows
[1:49:58] history to condemn that that can condemn
[1:50:01] that show me one time that an
[1:50:05] organization ever organized that didn't
[1:50:08] die
[1:50:12] my 3:13 what kind of life was it Holy
[1:50:16] Spirit what did it
[1:50:18] do it couldn't hold the holy spirit in
[1:50:21] there they still had dog the Holy Spirit
[1:50:23] wouldn't stand for it so it takes the
[1:50:26] holy the life out of the tree and gives
[1:50:29] him dogma and makes denominations we
[1:50:32] don't care what it says our denomination
[1:50:34] says this that now remember denominates
[1:50:37] it always dies and it never Rises
[1:50:40] my 3:19 God planted his tree to Bear
[1:50:46] spiritual
[1:50:47] fruit fruits of his spirit is that right
[1:50:51] but what did man man always tries to
[1:50:55] make an artificial form he did back
[1:50:58] there he does now now let's fire hard
[1:51:03] now and quick a man always tried to keep
[1:51:08] the spiritual church and make it
[1:51:10] artificial my
[1:51:16] goodness all right praise the Lord you
[1:51:20] feeling all right we're going to try to
[1:51:21] skip around and try to find a
[1:51:23] close might be a while you feeling okay
[1:51:28] we've only been an hour I'm going to try
[1:51:31] to make this highspeed finish got a few
[1:51:34] more minutes Amen in 4:15 it says what
[1:51:39] but what he was God's perfect Prophet
[1:51:42] tree the example tree the bridegroom
[1:51:45] tree Glory going to say something
[1:51:49] directly if he is the bridegroom tree do
[1:51:53] you believe it amen from the Garden of
[1:51:56] Eden then the bridegroom tree without
[1:52:00] the female don't bear
[1:52:02] fruit so he's got to have a bride
[1:52:06] tree she's got to be born of the same
[1:52:09] material the word made flesh in the tree
[1:52:13] hope you get it it's the same life in
[1:52:16] this female tree the bridegroom as it is
[1:52:21] in the bride the work works that I do
[1:52:23] shall you do also is that right he is
[1:52:26] the bridegroom
[1:52:28] remember I am the vine ye are the
[1:52:31] branches
[1:52:34] my my we're going
[1:52:39] to these signs shall follow them that
[1:52:43] are believers not make Believers but
[1:52:46] Believers these things that I do you
[1:52:49] will do and vindicate that you are a
[1:52:52] Believer just the same as the works that
[1:52:55] I have done because the living father
[1:52:58] lives in me it ain't me doing the work
[1:53:01] it's my
[1:53:02] father and it won't be you doing the
[1:53:05] work it will be me in
[1:53:10] you doing the work see now you go into
[1:53:14] the world otherwise you're going to form
[1:53:19] what is known to me as the bride
[1:53:24] amen I'll go with
[1:53:26] you
[1:53:28] and you will be part of me I will be you
[1:53:34] will be my bride my life will be in your
[1:53:38] body just like a husband and wife are
[1:53:41] one person you and I are going to be one
[1:53:44] at that day you will know that I am in
[1:53:47] the father and the father in me and I in
[1:53:49] you and you in me oh I just love that
[1:53:52] Satan just gets so angry at that see the
[1:53:55] Oneness of God all that God was he
[1:53:58] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:54:00] was he poured into the church there you
[1:54:03] are makes them one oh don't you love
[1:54:06] that God wants to restore this kind of
[1:54:09] Fellowship a Oneness he said I would be
[1:54:12] in you it's not going to be you it's
[1:54:14] going to be my father that's in you
[1:54:16] doing the works oh I can just let go and
[1:54:19] let God I can just rest assure God you
[1:54:22] made the promise you said you would do
[1:54:24] this I believe it and God uses Believers
[1:54:28] to vindicate his word aren't you
[1:54:30] grateful you're a Believer aren't you
[1:54:32] grateful he planted something in your
[1:54:34] heart that you can believe and you can
[1:54:36] humble yourself say God I I don't feel
[1:54:38] like I'm really all what you you said
[1:54:41] but you know what I'm not basing it on
[1:54:43] my feelings I'm basing it on faith in
[1:54:45] your Eternal Word faith that you are
[1:54:48] able to restore me to the sound mind
[1:54:50] that you promised I would have
[1:54:55] amen now this is in 486 now look God
[1:55:00] never put out an organization the church
[1:55:02] was grafted in an organization and God
[1:55:05] cuts it off cuts it off cuts off the
[1:55:07] lifeline and it Bears organizational
[1:55:09] fruit but if the vine put forth another
[1:55:12] branch and it come out of the vine it'll
[1:55:14] bear the
[1:55:16] same that it
[1:55:18] did and you see the first one was Rome
[1:55:22] sent their Beetle out there and ate it
[1:55:25] off but God is going to grow one so high
[1:55:29] that it can't touch it it's going to
[1:55:32] come up it's going to come on up amen
[1:55:36] you can just say it's going to come on
[1:55:40] up let's go the tree goes from one place
[1:55:44] to another from one dispensation to
[1:55:47] another from Luther it went into Wesley
[1:55:49] and from Wesley went to Pentecost it
[1:55:52] goes to the word
[1:55:54] amen my I cannot rush over this this is
[1:55:58] now we're definitely coming to a
[1:56:09] close in um 488 it says it is Easter
[1:56:13] again for the True Believer of his
[1:56:16] never-failing word it is Easter it is a
[1:56:20] resurrection God has got of people
[1:56:23] everywhere am it's Easter for them
[1:56:27] why they have risen amen risen from
[1:56:32] those Creeds and denominations and come
[1:56:35] up through them it's Easter again the
[1:56:37] Royal seed has been hid in The
[1:56:40] Roots the word hid back there in his
[1:56:43] word for years and years and
[1:56:48] years and just now he began to reveal
[1:56:52] it's Easter time predestinated from the
[1:56:55] foundation of the world this church has
[1:56:58] begun to stand notice how God's
[1:57:02] predestinated in the beginning I got now
[1:57:06] I'm going to say anyhow all right notice
[1:57:09] here to restore the first Perfect Tree
[1:57:12] in three days after it's dead after the
[1:57:16] first tree's death He restored it in
[1:57:18] three days is that right restore back
[1:57:21] now the brid tree is also going to be
[1:57:24] restored in Three Ages or three stages

[2:11:51] the end time you know it couldn't have
[2:11:54] God was working and all of this was a
[2:11:57] secret the enemy had no idea what God
[2:12:00] was doing but he was restoring the very
[2:12:03] Kingdom the very Eden that ad that that
[2:12:06] the devil caus to fall he was working
[2:12:09] and working and working and restoring it
[2:12:12] I love this God cannot create something
[2:12:14] and something happened to deform it and
[2:12:17] it remains in that state no I don't
[2:12:21] don't care what happened I like what he
[2:12:23] said regardless of the circumstance of
[2:12:26] the condition God will bring it right
[2:12:29] back to what he wanted
[2:12:31] it so at the end whatever God wanted it
[2:12:34] to be it's going to be
[2:12:37] that I love it so your mistakes can't
[2:12:41] stop him and your faults and your your
[2:12:44] your your own judgment and your own

[2:13:01] something happened to it he's able to
[2:13:03] bring it right back to what he created
[2:13:05] it to be that's wonderful that is

[2:13:13] first coming he he couldn't claim he
[2:13:16] just came to pay the price he just came
[2:13:19] to die because there was a penalty of
[2:13:21] death and and something had to die so we
[2:13:24] can live but in the second coming this
[2:13:27] is now time to claim that's why he said
[2:13:30] there's a law in you in the end time
[2:13:33] because of the death because of the
[2:13:35] price that was paid you can stand you
[2:13:37] and say this is
[2:13:40] mine good health is
[2:13:42] mine the Holy Ghost is mine whatever you
[2:13:46] have need of it's mine you have the
[2:13:48] right to claim it why because the the
[2:13:51] price has already paid and he's here to
[2:13:54] restore it to the original state and you
[2:13:57] couldn't hunger for it if it wasn't for
[2:14:01] you we're not here impersonating

[2:14:30] death if it's whatever God can resurrect
[2:14:33] it he can bring it right back to what it

[2:14:39] matter the end time message is the god
[2:14:42] who stands and he said I'm here to
