to just attach to people Lord and destroy their lives but Lord you send a Living Word a word that would be able to go and deliver Lord that sickness Lord Jesus lord it's not something that we can do with our hands or something that we just say and just Lord but it's your word the word that was predestinated before the foundation of the world even in this hour Lord Jesus solar we speak that word

coming back for you all the Rays [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] time to tell you he's alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] everything is here fall so I come [Music] through Proclaim that is coming back for you good evening friends you may be seated I am not a preacher but I just yield to the spirit of the Lord we were sitting in a restaurant and the pastor just turned and told me you're gonna speak for us Sunday out of nowhere so I turned and I looked people using the forks and the knives differently so this thought of the prophet caught me there was a time when you know etiquettes had an absolute I can't think of that woman's name but the whole nation trusted in what that woman said I forget her name I was writing a note here I couldn't think of that woman's name what it was but here a few years ago they had to be this woman what she said if she said use the knife in the left hand that was that was it that was the absolute she was the answer to all of it and if you put the fork in the left hand then you were absolutely wrong what was her name congregation says Emily post oh that's for sure sure yeah that's who that now you were you were absolute she was she was etiquette absolute it must be that way okay so from there my thoughts that just traveling and I came to think about what does people in the world do I work in manufacturing as an electrician how do you troubleshoot a an equipment you have a print that shows the state of a good equipment so you have to identify your equipment that is down to the one that is good and winning in that state so that is identification so that's how the world does even those who do uh quality control they have this sample that is good so everything that comes out of the chain of production that must match this one that is good so from there I said Lord what do you want me to tell your people I don't know how to speak and I don't know how to tell it and I had this identification and who are you identifying yourself to and how do you identify to something or somebody you don't know so you got to know the characteristic that of the some people that you want to identify to so you can be like him so you can mush him so we stand and read the scripture so I took it in the message identification that brother when I'm preaching 63. he took the scripture in Philippians chapter 2 verse 5. shall we read let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God fought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so if the Mark you may be seated thank you if the mind that was in Cross be in you you will live the life of Christ no doubt about that because behind that mind is the spirit there is a life so you can say you are a Christian and leave any other life then the life that Rose in Christ that was in his mind that he has put in you a Christian is to be christ-like Christ's like is to believe the word and if you don't believe the word then you can't be Christ's like how can you say you are a Christian in the night half of the word how there's no way you've got to believe every single word from Kevin to Kevin like this old brother used to say like brother Branham said it so in our Psalm reading this morning we were reminded of ASAP and his work reminding children of God What the Lord Has Done and we have the same Duty this is what the Colossians tells us in Colossians 3. verse 16. says here let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms in hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord so what does the word of Lord do in your midst when it abides you remember the story of sister happy right they were fellowshipping around the world what happened A great miracle remember the story of Mary brother Abraham says they were walking together with Joseph talking about the Lord and the angel of the Lord came to her that night and revealed himself to her remember the disciples on the road to a mouse they were talking about the Lord and he appeared so do you take your time to talk about the Lord and talking about the word of your day and have you done that to experiment the power behind that word it is still the same as it was yesterday the Bible says by the word of the testimony they shall overcome so where do you hide your testimony and what do you keep it for and yet you know behind that testimony is life there is overcoming power why don't you use it you are giving yourself ideas like the Pastor said this morning you are hiding behind your fears stick the word use it it's going to produce what for which it has been sent David of old he was not fearsome when he saw Goliath he stood up he was a little fellow and this guy was a giant even more bigger than his soul the king Sorrows fearsome yet he was the most powerful among all the children of Israel and do you think that when they let David go to fight him it was because they think he was going to win no it's just because every one of them was afraid to die so they say he doesn't worth anything even if he dies at least we're gonna leave and yet be slaves so they had already accepted to be slaves but that was not the case with David he knew where he stood he knew whose God he was serving he was a living God that can't be defeated today the same God he can't be defeated so who do you want to identify yourself to the Bible says that the character that we have to identify to is Jesus Christ he's God but he sent Prophets to show us that us is moral we can identify ourselves ourselves to him because he was God in flesh but these were morals like you and me and yet they produced his character let's take one of them uh Elijah Elijah was a man of like passion like you and me he prayed for the wind not to come for three and a half years do you know what happened his word was made to live by the Living God you can do the same but you have to surrender yourself to God and be sure that what you do is the perfect will of God because when you are in the perfect will of God he will give life to the word that comes out of your mouth he always does that we want to be make this Bible our Looking Glass and let ourselves be molded by his character having his character his mind letting the mind that was in Christ be in us his mind was always what was his mind to do the mind that was in Christ always to say with the father's word no matter what looked glossy and what looked this way it didn't make any difference to him the father's word is what counted everywhere when he met the devil he never even used his power to defeat him he used what the word because that was him I like this double study that you do when I came yesterday you were talking about desperation do you know that all these characters that the prophet talk about in this message desperation they overcame because there was something common among all of them either they have come across this testimony like Blind by Timbers who heard about Jesus and he believed or like Elijah he was immersed in the word Moses he was immersed in the word so when the time of trouble came he knew where he stood so don't wait until the time of Trouble Comes to feed on the world you've got to feed on the word every second minute of the day every you know where you stand there's nothing greater than the word nothing listen to what the prophet said about the word the best way that God could ever fortify his army was to fight fortify them with the best in our nation we got spies in England has got spies here yet we are friendly we got Spies all over the world and the word has got spies in here they are watching see what kind of new missile what kind of a new thing then they go back to the nation find something to counter attack why and they are they they address their men get things ready for that kind of a war it's always going on there is a Warfare between the devil and God always has been and every year they are finding something new the old airplanes they used back there the old p-38s and whatever they was they scrapped them they got new Jets the old Springfield is no good at all they got a missile rifle now the old Blockbuster is for far behind well even the all trains the old steam engines used to pull the stuff up and down the tracks obsolete they got something new they always searching something new something new now they are trying to dig down in the ground find some way to escape the atomic bomb they won't something new something new every day that the world has been the same since before the foundation of the world and it is still overcoming God gave the best at the beginning for his Great Mighty Army and he has never had to change it because as I said last night his first decision is the best and only he gave his people his word and he gave us today his word in the totality of it he hasn't hidden anything everything that was in the back of his mind he has reveal it to us so what do we do with it do we try to identify ourselves to him or do we try to do something new some theology not the Theology of the denomination because we have theology now in the ranks of the message God has sent us a prophet when he sent Moses one of the characters that we have to identify to before taking Moses or after taking Moses out of the scene he called Joshua and do you know what God told Joshua let us wait together Joshua 1 7. only beasts thou strong and very courageous that Val mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commended me who is talking to Joshua and where is Moses date but listen what he tells him which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left raise the secret of succeeding you have the word you have the message what do you want to look for with the word stay with the message there's no other weapon if you want to succeed stay with this word stand fast is the Prof the Pastor said this morning and let me take that a little further will you the scripture is what tells you what you are that expresses you and expresses me the scripture tell what we are it's so loud that our voice cannot be even heard our life speaks louder than our voice see and it God's way of letting us see what we are Jesus said the same thing they are they that testify of me they prove what I am and which one of you can condemn me of unbelief sin if I haven't properly listened I'm talking about looking at yourself if I haven't properly identified myself as being what the word said that I would be so each one of us he is talking of each one of us do we identify ourselves properly to what the world say we should be wonder if we Christians could think that tonight wonder if we can look in God's looking glass of what requirements is of a Christian and identify ourselves that way I wonder if we could I wonder if we can identify ourselves tonight with John 3 16 and all all other kind of scriptures mark 16. chapter and all these other places I wonder if we can and you know the result if we do nothing is going to stand our way we're going to be the most successful people on the Earth but the problem is we want to define success our own way we want to give ourselves a picture of something we are looking for instead of going and search for the will of God for our lives when you discover the will of God for your life whatever comes your way troubles and everything he will be there he will make you successful whatever comes your way put yourself in the shoes of the children of Israel in the furnace what do you do have done what are you going to stand in that heat it took the word of God the life behind that word in their heart to stand that fear your furnace it took that same word for Daniel to stand the Lions do you realize that even the king believed in the god of Daniel because that morning he came and called Daniel how can you call somebody that has been put in the lion dance and these lions are hungry how he believed in the god of Daniel and he came that morning Daniel servant of the Living God your God has he saved you and the god of Daniel has done that just what the king believed so if this Pagan King could believe in the god of Daniel you are here standing today God has revealed to you all the secrets that was behind his mind what do you want to do with that do you want to use it properly and identify yourself as a winner like God has put you here to be aware let's go back in the garden of healing can he saw his brother Abel offering a sacrifice that was accepted it was so simple for him just to do what God told him identify yourself to what your body is doing but you know what there was no life in him there was no seed in him like the Pastor said this morning there was no seed in him for him to do what his brother did but if there was a seed of life in him he was going to do what his brother did and he was going to leave as a winner so what we have to do is humble ourselves before God search his will yield to him and he's going to use this the way he wants to use us not the way we think we should do because that's where most of our problems come because I will look my brother and I want this my brother here to be this way and if he is not acting the way I think of him then he's wrong no that's not the way that God God asked us to accept each other I have to accept my brother the way God has made him that's the way I have to and that's what we want to look at tonight I want to look at me and I want to look at yourself I want you to look at yourself and as we look into God's Great mirror of his word be able to identify ourselves with some that we are going to be to speak about some of the characters of other times and I want to see myself in God's looking glass cause if anything will show you where you are standing it's this book there is no book like it because it is all truth I don't say that other books are not true but I know this one is true it's all all a-l-l truth because it's the word of God now Jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into God's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that is a perfect example for each one of us we want to be like Mary who told the angel Let It Be according to Thy Word and the brother Branham says that the word is in the bride like it was in Mary so we've got to do like like every single promise that we read and listen to from this message it may seem awkward it may seem strange but it is still the truth imagine as I said this Daniel in the lands then it was strange that yet he knew where he stood he had to be standing on the world because what was the word you shouldn't worship idols and they gave him two options you worship this Idol we spare your life all you worship your God and we kill you he knew he was worshiping the truth and living God kill me my one my life doesn't worth anything but your life with everything in the sight of God do you know what he gives what value he gives your life the blood of his only begotten son that is the value God gives to your life when we were yet dead in sin and trespasses he quickened us go to the cemetery today can you talk to them what can they do in those Graves nothing but he quickened you every one of you when we were yet dead in sin and trespasses we couldn't do anything it's by grace so what do we do with that Grace are we fooling it or are we valuing it we should value the grace that God is showing to us if you were in that day what group would you be identified with the prophet with the Vindicated word although they were in the minority we had a Vindicated word today so which group are you identified with today because the same group you are identified with today is the same you would have identified with during that day or would you be with the popular opinion folks well I tell you I believe that man is crazy that man he's crazy and the only way that you'd ever know he wasn't crazy is for the same God to reveal to you the same thing he had revealed to Moses and the only way that we'll ever be able to be the images of God and the sons of God is for God to reveal to us and express himself through his word to us and us to the world that's the only Channel they are not two for Christ was the image here on Earth that you could see God in a man expressed image of God because God was in him so much that they were one and now when Christ left he Sanctified the church you that the church might take his place and express the word of God see that's the only way it can be done look the place God is giving you to represent him on Earth [Music] do you know what happened to the ambassador of the U.S when he goes where he is sent all the power of the United States is behind him but that power is nothing compared to the power of the Living God when he sends you as his representative here on Earth you have all the support of Heaven behind you what did he say whatever you bind on Earth I'll land in here whatever you lose on Earth I'll lose in heaven do you realize what you have in your hands do you want to use it like in the message yesterday desperation where brother Branham says that faith and love are sisters there's no way you can have love true love without faith and there's no way you can have true faith without love they are twin sisters and then they work hand in hand but you see what side would you have to look in your present character if Deton would have raised up and said that and you had been standing here at that time would you have held on to God's message and messenger and stayed by it and was forefully Vindicated to be the truth or would you have took your your papers and went over and drained some other group or that see just think about it when it seemed all was against God's Vindicated message and messenger of that age the Chiefs was down on Moses everything was gone look like God had forsaken him but they had dancing God do something they knowed God was in it and God is in it tonight as you stand here he is in it to tell you that he loves you that he has paid the price that he has the purpose of Christmas is the past to say this morning is for you to receive the life behind the mind of Christ is for you to get that mind of Christ in you and live by that mind brother sister now to you people who has received Christ years ago and maybe you feel that that you have received that token I hope that it's right if you have you don't have to worry about it it reflects him itself how could I keep from being Beethoven if he lived in me if Christ is in you just look at yourself in God's mirror here the Bible see what some Bible character looked like see if you picked you up with Daniel with Ezekiel with the creation of the early church see if your picture you picture up with them are you worldly do you love the world all the things of the world has all that died and you become a new creature identify yourself tonight in your present State now where you are standing with some Bible character where would you been if you had lived in Noah's time where you'd have been where we would have been in the days of the Lord Jesus when he was here on Earth in his flesh what group would you be identified with tonight just think of it see what group would you been identified with when Paul was correcting them that day in conventions and for the things they were doing what group would you be identified with see just look back it's a Looking Glass we can see where we whatever we were we are now that's what we'd have been back there because the spirit that's in us now identified back there that that same spirit that was on them back there you see we have to know where we stand we have to know what we identify ourselves with because that's what gives us our nature if you want to go beyond go back to where you were you have to have been there before if you have never been there how are you going to go back in a place where you have never been you are you are not even known there who is going to welcome you there no one no one is going to welcome you where you are not belonging now what Moses if you'd have lived in the days of Moses you do have believed Moses Moses message after it had been proven and Vindicated by God but would you went with Korra and death and then and said you are not the only holy man think of it that's what God told Moses you are not the only holy man so if you do the same today that's exactly what you would have done in that same day other people can do these things that you do too see you'd have B you'd have to be one and you are one tonight so I won't be long I just want to remind you that we are a blessed people and God loves us so much that he has paid the price you have nothing to do as I mentioned earlier when you were yet dead in sin and trespasses he quickened you so what do you think he can do I told you try to go here in the cemetery talk to them if they can do something God has quickened you and he has given you all the power to lose or bind things here on Earth you're gonna do the same in heaven so you have that power right now as the prophet said how do you know that God loves you because he said so and when God loves me what else do I need what that's the most important thing you need the because when God loves you he surrounds you with all the cares you need from him nothing you can miss when God loves you don't look at what these eyes see look beyond the eyes look with the eyes of faith as I said about sister happy right she was poor even brother Branham when he when he that anointing he told her you can ask for money you can ask for a house you can ask for your sister that is sick here but this power came from God and she asked the right thing that cannot perish the salvation of her kids if you had asked for money it would have finished after some days but the Salvation did eternal so what are we looking for tonight are we looking to identify ourselves to Eternal character the character that will take us to our place of Eternal abode or we look to the world to be destroyed with this world because the world is going to pass but this word of God will live forever everything else will vanish that the way from eternity to Eternity it lives forever God bless you brother Billy should amen that was refreshing a man amen is in the word of God beautiful amen my just a reminder you know as we're speaking you know when you really think about this identification even as the scripture is saying that let this mind that was in Christ be also in you mama there's so many often time we will place ourselves here and place the scripture here and try to compare well the word says this am I doing this the word says that am I doing this that's not the identification he's wanting you to do he wants you to identify with the word to understand that this is what's spoken of you when you read the Bible you're reading about yourself it's not something that that's outside of you remember varvanam says that you can never take a Kaka bird and make it a grain of wheat you can't do that you can never take something that's bone to be one and make it the other so therefore the it when you believe the word by the spirit as is spoken it's you you're identifying with what you are supposed to be in this hour it's not something outside of you you have to stop looking at it and say well I gotta be holy I gotta no Holiness is in you yeah that's right all of this characteristics is already in you because if it was in you God will not call for something that's not in you it's calling you to it because it's already you are the word you are what he has spoken and and I want you just you know to say something more when he's saying let this mind be in you that was in Christ and it continues on it says yet being in the form of the flesh or the form of man he taught it not robbery to be equal with God in other words he didn't take aside or judge himself to be lower than the spiritual things that were written in the Bible about him he didn't look at himself and say well I'm born In the Flesh and here I am and you know my mom is telling me that an angel told him and yet over here I'm hearing all this rumors that's not what he judged himself based on he took the word and he acted on it he went everywhere whatever the word Sadie will do he went and did it this is more powerful that we can understand I think we we sell ourselves short so for the tall for them because we look ourselves always through the lenses of the flesh you didn't come here because your flesh wanted to be here you you you are saved because you believe the word by the spirit the Spirit came and convicted you and you believed the word and if that's the way you came in that's the way you're gonna get till the end don't let your flesh get somewhere in between if you see yourself in the manner that's not bible-like say this is not me this is not what I was called to be that's what you have to look at and say this is not me I'm called to be what the Bible says I am I'm called to be what the word says I am and if you do that then you identifying a proper identification amen let's all stand I just I I don't know about you but every time the word comes it just stirs up something within you and say God I want to identify with what you call me to be amen amen let's keep our pastor in prayer I know you know he was able to preach this morning but we just want to make
