[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] [Applause]
[0:10] oh
[0:14] [Music]
[0:20] said sir
[0:22] did you know that your little girls
[0:24] could get yellow fever and black fever
[0:26] and die overnight
[0:28] he referred to a different people
[0:30] that had lost him
[0:32] and i had taken them back there and and
[0:34] he says i had taken them back there and
[0:37] and he says on diseases that had no that
[0:40] they had no uh inoculation
[0:43] and things like leprosy and and and your
[0:46] pretty wife and the two little girl with
[0:48] leprosy and the hot sun and the things
[0:50] they've put on
[0:52] aren't you afraid
[0:53] of the danger of taking your children
[0:56] and your wife is such a place the
[0:58] missionaries stood there and the young
[1:00] fellow and tears begin to run down his
[1:02] cheeks
[1:03] and they turn around and he says
[1:05] brothers my vision of god's call he said
[1:09] if god called me to be in africa my
[1:11] children and my family is more safe in
[1:13] africa than in the play at any place in
[1:16] the world
[1:17] i was thinking about this and a little
[1:20] say this it's
[1:21] because that's the place of our
[1:23] protection
[1:24] it's very important as we gather here we
[1:26] are show within ourselves i'm here
[1:28] because god put me here
[1:31] i i'm here because god blessed me here
[1:33] because if that's not the case then
[1:35] there's a wandering there's no
[1:37] questioning there's everything but this
[1:39] young missionary was sure within his
[1:41] heart it says i'm here it says i would
[1:43] be at the place where god called me to
[1:45] be i'm useful there god will protect you
[1:48] there he will do all things and that's
[1:50] why for a remembrance for you to
[1:53] remember the sacrifice that was given
[1:56] the price that was paid for even is no
[1:58] longer and is living in the people the
[2:01] life it can never die if you go back of
[2:04] all those people including the pharaohs
[2:06] you will go you'll find that there's
[2:08] such a tomb but yet within the tomb
[2:10] you'll find that the body is in there
[2:12] the only tomb that has nobody included
[2:15] where you can go and the body is
[2:17] disappear is the lord jesus christ why
[2:20] because it's a memorial to of god trying
[2:23] to show
[2:24] he says much ever made
[2:27] much he says much everywhere
[2:29] chiefly says
[2:31] and because unto them were committed the
[2:34] oracles of god for what if some
[2:37] did not believe he says then shall the
[2:40] unbelief make the faith of god without a
[2:43] fact oh but in verse
[2:45] verse 4 he says god forbid yeah true but
[2:48] let every man be a liar as it is written
[2:52] oh my brother my sister the unbeliever
[2:54] doesn't make the world of god untrue
[2:56] though make believer doesn't make the
[2:58] world of god untrue all they're doing is
[3:00] they're testifying of the truth of god
[3:03] that only him that god calls will come
[3:07] all they're doing is the testifying of
[3:09] the truth that he already said and only
[3:11] my children my sheep will hear my voice
[3:14] follow they will fall after all of these
[3:16] things but my children will come to me
[3:18] all they're doing is testifying that
[3:20] they were they didn't have it in in them
[3:22] to begin with they didn't have the seed
[3:24] to believe with if the uncorruptable
[3:27] seed will hear the word of god and
[3:28] believe it
[3:30] and he says yeah but random speaks about
[3:33] the the the character to realize and to
[3:36] come to a place where we are here
[3:38] building a memorial
[3:42] we are not here as
[3:44] individual people doing their own things
[3:47] where we just come together and we
[3:50] retorial
[3:51] god is building a spiritual house and
[3:54] every part of us every one of us is a
[3:57] stone that's going to go in this living
[4:00] memorial is a stone that's going to be
[4:03] part of this great building and i don't
[4:06] know if we'll have time to get to it he
[4:08] talks about the temple of solomon how
[4:10] that the parts of the temples were built
[4:13] all across the world they were shaped
[4:19] it talks about if i can put it in
[4:21] categories perhaps for the sake of time
[4:24] he talks about two separate types of
[4:26] memorials talks about two separate types
[4:28] of memorials
[4:30] the first one that he talks about is
[4:31] joshua memorials and i want you to think
[4:34] about this for a time now here is the
[4:37] children of israel they have come from
[4:39] egypt and now they are in
[4:41] at the doorstep of of the promised land
[4:44] for them to cross now
[4:46] i want to remind you that the group that
[4:48] i will call uh a wilderness mentality
[4:52] that god had to get out of them
[4:54] all they did is they were reminiscent of
[4:57] the things that happened in egypt
[4:59] oh do you remember them garlic and
[5:02] do you remember that time and do you
[5:04] remember them onions do you remember
[5:06] this and do you remember
[5:08] they're forgetting about all that they
[5:10] trust them
[5:11] a perfect way for them to move it says
[5:15] that i want you to send the priest with
[5:17] the ark of the covenant first
[5:20] the priest takes the ark and they begin
[5:22] to walk and
[5:23] and as they walk the scripture says
[5:25] when the feet get into the water
[5:28] now
[5:29] when you go read you hear that
[5:32] they went to the river jordan when they
[5:34] went to jordan
[5:36] it was the time where it was overflowing
[5:40] but one of them says
[5:41] they must have gone at the wrong time
[5:45] i want you to think about that you get
[5:47] there
[5:48] and the river is all flooded
[5:51] when there are seasons where it's a
[5:53] little bit lower but you show up at the
[5:55] season when it's overflooded
[6:01] now they could have looked at it and
[6:03] said well you know what this is not the
[6:04] time let's go back but the word of the
[6:07] lord had gone before them and that's
[6:10] what i want us if this tonight we could
[6:12] just capture this i feel like i'll just
[6:14] it will just help us tonight now it's
[6:16] important we
[6:18] as the children of god when we sit here
[6:20] you have to know that you are not here
[6:22] by your own thinking the word went
[6:25] before you
[6:26] before you could be here the word had to
[6:29] come out of god's mouth he had to have
[6:31] pronounced it he had to have said it he
[6:34] have to have promised it he have to have
[6:36] projected it then if you go by the
[6:38] strength of what he protected nothing
[6:41] will stop on your way
[6:44] if you go by your own thinking you're
[6:46] gonna drown if you just go because
[6:49] everybody else is going you're not gonna
[6:50] make it
[6:53] so now they come
[6:56] and
[6:57] the priests get into the watering
[7:01] and now as the crossing
[7:03] joshua tells them it says now
[7:06] out of the 12 tribes
[7:08] i want each tribe each person from each
[7:11] tribe a representative of all of them
[7:14] that they come and come into the very
[7:16] depths of the the river when god had
[7:19] dried it up that they will pick up each
[7:21] one a stone and take it over they came
[7:25] and they pick up a stone one pick up a
[7:26] stone and for each tribe and they took
[7:29] and it says all about
[7:30] a thousand to two thousand two a million
[7:33] to two million they all crossed and they
[7:36] went and they took it to the place where
[7:38] they're gonna rest
[7:40] and this god said they said now
[7:42] i want you to build a memorial with
[7:44] these stones i want you to stack them up
[7:47] and build a memorial it says when your
[7:49] children will ask you
[7:51] that you will tell them what the lord
[7:53] had done
[7:57] now i want you to take that story and
[7:59] just put it to yourself
[8:02] this is god moving in the time where
[8:04] things seem to be impossible
[8:07] this is god moving at the season where
[8:10] it seems like we're never gonna get out
[8:11] of this situation
[8:13] this is god having moved in your life at
[8:16] the time where you thought this was the
[8:18] end of me
[8:20] this is god moving at a time where you
[8:22] knew within yourself that i'm done
[8:25] this is the end of me but yet is moving
[8:28] and then within the movement he's giving
[8:31] you a stone for you to carry a
[8:33] revelation for you to carry out and use
[8:36] that revelation for you to talk to your
[8:38] children about
[8:40] oh my brother my sister god is not built
[8:43] upon just teaching where we can come and
[8:45] teach each and every one god is a savior
[8:48] god is a healer god is this and god does
[8:50] this and says go on and be fine no god
[8:54] wants to give you a stone for yourself
[8:57] he wants you to build the memorial
[8:59] within yourself where you can come up
[9:01] here or where you can go anywhere stand
[9:04] there and say i'm not just talking about
[9:06] this bible but i'm here to let you know
[9:08] that this bible became this person in
[9:11] other words what is said in here he did
[9:13] it here
[9:16] a living memorial that's why i said all
[9:19] the other memorials where are they
[9:21] they're in the ground the only living
[9:23] memorial that stood up that men could
[9:26] never take away was the lord jesus
[9:28] christ and how did he live he says
[9:30] because i live you shall live also
[9:37] you are that memorial that god is
[9:39] building
[9:40] so he takes them and he takes the stone
[9:42] and
[9:43] and they build it
[9:44] and i began to think about peter when he
[9:46] said he said
[9:48] who do men say that i am
[9:50] now those that came out of welding when
[9:52] they came out of egypt when they came
[9:54] when they were there it says who the men
[9:56] said they could have said well you know
[9:58] what
[9:58] i was born in the wilderness my parents
[10:00] told me about how we crossed the red sea
[10:03] they said my parents told me
[10:05] how that god opened up the red sea
[10:07] and it was it dried it up he blocked it
[10:10] on both sides and we were able to walk
[10:12] my parents and everyone was able to walk
[10:15] on dry land and they came in and that's
[10:17] how we come here
[10:19] but you see that was not good enough and
[10:21] then it says what do you say that i am
[10:23] that was the apparent stone what is your
[10:26] stone
[10:28] what is your stone tonight
[10:31] god is not barbara tells us god doesn't
[10:33] have grandchildren he's not interested
[10:36] for us to tell the story over and over
[10:39] and over so he becomes good news no he
[10:42] the reason for the story is so that the
[10:44] ones that hears it seeks his own
[10:47] experience and experience the same god
[10:49] in the same power
[10:54] and that's why when we come together
[10:56] when we talk about those things
[10:58] it's not so much we it's us lifting god
[11:02] in out of history lifting him up out of
[11:05] whatever he's done and bringing me into
[11:08] your situation bringing him into your
[11:11] problem where you are to bring you to
[11:13] the understanding that the same god is
[11:16] here to do the same thing
[11:24] a new generation i came across
[11:28] my mama
[11:30] the wilderness the wilderness mentality
[11:34] my they could talk
[11:36] about the great god
[11:38] yeah in fact
[11:40] on the testimony on the sea
[11:43] he says they would talk and they would
[11:44] sit there and begin to talk it said what
[11:47] done it for you it says my mother told
[11:49] me about god the god of our father in
[11:51] the old testament
[11:53] how did he reign manna from heaven and
[11:56] it says i asked him i said well how did
[11:58] he do it does it mean jehovah has oven
[12:01] up there and and things up there how did
[12:04] he do even in the old new testament when
[12:06] he took bread he said does it mean he
[12:08] has often up their way he would take the
[12:10] bread and bake it and then cut it down
[12:12] and rain it down he said no jehovah is a
[12:15] creator
[12:17] what was he doing he was building
[12:19] memorial but as they began to tell those
[12:21] testimonies he says i heard what my
[12:23] parent says but when i saw him do it
[12:26] when i saw it with my own ass that
[12:29] settles it and my brother my sister
[12:31] don't settle on the stories
[12:35] don't settle on the stories don't settle
[12:37] on what this one says that one says
[12:39] that's wonderful to to comfort you but
[12:42] let that story become the reality for
[12:44] you
[12:47] without that we're just building up
[12:50] building up our own houses we're
[12:52] building up our own memorial the
[12:54] memorial of god is built by individuals
[12:57] that god himself has touched
[13:00] that's why the prophet could say it says
[13:02] what is the the what is the new birth he
[13:05] says it's jesus christ
[13:07] reveal himself to you personally
[13:11] why because then it becomes a memorial
[13:14] you know we could have received what we
[13:16] deserved we could have received what we
[13:19] deserve but oh god who's rich in mercy
[13:22] he came even when you were in your sin
[13:24] when you knew if right now for
[13:27] everything i've done i deserve to die
[13:29] when you knew within yourself that i
[13:31] don't deserve anything good but yet for
[13:34] his goodness
[13:37] but why did he do that
[13:39] i become
[13:41] a slave of his goodness
[13:43] it doesn't matter how down somebody is
[13:47] because i'm slave to his goodness
[13:49] all i could do is tell of his goodness
[13:52] you know you don't have to be like that
[13:54] you're like oh you don't understand my
[13:56] situation i'm worse off i'm gone and
[13:58] everything says well i was gone too but
[14:00] i met a god but i met someone who can
[14:03] take you out of your situation i met
[14:05] somebody who can stabilize you i meant
[14:07] someone who can come and take all of
[14:09] your mess all that you've messed up
[14:12] everything that you've destroyed he
[14:14] takes all of that and he makes sense of
[14:16] it
[14:29] now
[14:30] i want you to realize
[14:34] this memorial
[14:37] of joshua
[14:40] was not built
[14:44] when everything was calm
[14:46] and peaceful
[14:48] and nice
[14:50] where the river jordan was all the way
[14:52] down
[14:53] no
[14:55] when it was over flooded
[15:00] our testimonies it's not something well
[15:03] you know one day i was just asleep and
[15:05] and then i just woke up and the sun rose
[15:08] up just a different way
[15:10] anyway it was shining on the trees it
[15:13] just seemed a little different
[15:15] than i knew god was calling me
[15:17] you were running
[15:19] you were running you were trying to hide
[15:21] he was a hunting for you
[15:23] it was hunting for you in fact he made
[15:26] your life so miserable you looked you
[15:29] said god i come he came dragging you
[15:31] after whatever hole you were in
[15:38] i i hear testimonies even myself i
[15:40] remember i said if i don't do this i'm
[15:42] gonna die in fact the next word that
[15:45] comes out of your mouth is death you're
[15:47] like i don't even understand what i'm
[15:49] saying but that's what he had to do
[15:53] it's not you you've studied a bible
[15:56] and you've come to some conclusion that
[15:59] jesus christ is the son of god then i'll
[16:01] give my life to you they've been people
[16:03] baptized in the midnight 1 a.m 2 a.m in
[16:06] the morning what's wrong god is moving
[16:09] upon them
[16:14] and that same god is here the same bread
[16:16] as well sister i'm not talking about
[16:18] this so we can just say praise god for
[16:20] the past i want us to build a memorial
[16:23] within our own self to come to the place
[16:25] as we heard it this morning where our
[16:27] hearts is on fire when we come to a
[16:29] place it says i want every day that i
[16:32] walk up the same manifestation of this
[16:35] god of what he did what he promised i
[16:37] want my life to be a memorial of those
[16:40] things
[16:44] not the messenger of doom and gloom
[16:47] not one that can perpetrate whatever is
[16:49] happening in the world
[16:51] you know in this book brother branham
[16:53] talks about having visited i believe it
[16:55] was new york it says he went on the
[16:57] statue of liberty and it says there was
[16:59] a light there was there had been a storm
[17:02] and then it says but yet there was a
[17:04] bunch of dead sparrow all across
[17:06] and he couldn't understand he asked what
[17:08] happened
[17:09] it says well what happened is there was
[17:12] a light
[17:13] when the storm came
[17:15] instead of this pharaoh used the light
[17:17] for them to go hide
[17:19] the sparrows were trying to put out the
[17:21] light so they keep beating themselves
[17:23] against the light until the dead
[17:27] you can fight the word of god
[17:29] and survive
[17:31] people that criticize this they don't
[17:33] know what they're criticizing it's not
[17:34] made for them it says that he says if
[17:37] they became insane
[17:40] now if someone all they put all of their
[17:44] efforts
[17:46] they have nothing else to do
[17:48] they sit there they just read the
[17:50] message read the message so they can
[17:52] find mistakes
[17:53] that's signed to him for insanity to me
[17:58] all they do is trust trying to find what
[18:01] letter what scripture what word is not
[18:03] matching with that that's insanity see
[18:06] to them it's insanity but to us is life
[18:09] why because we've seen the same thing
[18:11] happening with us
[18:15] he says in
[18:16] joshua 24
[18:18] verse 13 and he says and i have given
[18:21] you land which i had not bought labor oh
[18:24] i love
[18:26] this he says i have given you lamb land
[18:30] which thou did not labor and cities ye
[18:34] that have that that ye build not and ye
[18:37] dwelled in them
[18:39] and the vineyard and and
[18:42] olive yard which that he had not planted
[18:45] he had not did not uh the
[18:47] which he planted not that he'd eat he
[18:51] says now therefore fear the lord
[18:53] and serve him in sincerity and truth
[18:56] and put away the gods which your father
[18:59] served on the other side of the flood
[19:02] in egypt
[19:04] and serve the lord
[19:06] in deuteronomy 6 and 10 it says
[19:09] and it shall be that when the lord thy
[19:11] god
[19:13] shall have brought you brought thee into
[19:15] the land which you swear unto thy father
[19:18] to abraham isaac and jacob to give thee
[19:21] this great goodly land the goodly cities
[19:24] which thou build us not
[19:27] and a house full of good things which
[19:30] thou fill it not
[19:32] and
[19:33] and wells digged
[19:35] which thou diggest not
[19:37] vineyard and olive tree
[19:39] which thou planted not
[19:42] it says when thou have eaten
[19:45] and be full
[19:47] then be where beware
[19:49] lest thou forget the lord which brought
[19:52] thee forth out of the land of egypt
[19:56] from the house of bondage
[19:58] what a promise
[20:00] houses we did not build
[20:03] vineyard we did not plant
[20:06] what was it it was exactly what he
[20:09] promised that it would give them a land
[20:12] filled with milk and honey
[20:15] god himself promised that it was going
[20:17] to give them for the sake of time i'll
[20:19] just move on
[20:23] what about him says
[20:29] he speaks about
[20:34] he says in joshua now
[20:37] his word was at stake
[20:40] paragraph 21
[20:43] just as noah
[20:45] of old but joshua
[20:48] must cross over this river
[20:52] and he looked like he picked the worst
[20:53] time that he could ever that it could
[20:56] ever be
[20:57] that he could that he could ever be
[21:00] taught
[21:01] it was in the month of april
[21:03] and that's when the snow
[21:05] was melting in judea
[21:07] coming down through the mountain and
[21:10] and the old jordan is
[21:12] muddy and spread
[21:15] plumbing
[21:17] out into it says into the field
[21:19] water filled
[21:22] of jordan
[21:23] and you look like if it would have been
[21:25] the if it would have been
[21:27] if it would have been the mathematical
[21:29] of of education or scientist he picked
[21:33] the worst time
[21:35] in all the years to cross in all the
[21:37] years across jordan
[21:38] but god likes to take those kind of time
[21:42] to prove that he's god
[21:47] the a memorial
[21:49] is built on god proving that he's god
[21:55] it's not built upon you when you have
[21:58] worked so hard and then finally figured
[22:00] it out
[22:02] it's built on you looking and said
[22:05] i have ran out of all that i could do
[22:08] i have done all that i could it looks
[22:10] like it never worked then something
[22:12] happened
[22:13] you know for a fact that god did this
[22:17] it says in one man of god who believed
[22:19] god
[22:21] and know what god had promised has
[22:23] promised he's not afraid to do it
[22:26] because god will god will stick with his
[22:30] word
[22:30] just as certain as he is god
[22:33] and it says paragraph 22 and he says and
[22:36] when he said first take the ark and go
[22:39] forward
[22:41] and when those priests feet touched that
[22:44] jordan no matter how well she was
[22:48] and how she was swelling
[22:51] it would give way
[22:52] to god's eternal word
[22:55] it says for the word
[22:56] is in is in the ark jesus says now
[23:00] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[23:02] word will never pass away so joshua
[23:04] knowing that his word must rest upon
[23:09] god's word
[23:12] that's the secret his word must rest
[23:15] upon god's word and he put god's word
[23:18] first
[23:19] oh it says wish you sick people here
[23:22] tonight we'll do that put god's word
[23:25] with your confession put your confession
[23:29] it says you believe it and set it out
[23:31] there and call those things which are
[23:34] not as though they were when you are it
[23:37] says then march
[23:39] then we are marching on do it do it that
[23:42] way god's word will take you through
[23:47] it's not as making it through and i want
[23:50] to say this
[23:52] why it has to be the word of god
[23:56] because the word
[23:58] knows things that are to be
[24:03] because the word
[24:04] knows what's before what's to come
[24:07] remember but matthew mentioned it this
[24:09] morning
[24:10] the the characteristic of a prophet is a
[24:13] seer is one who can see what's around
[24:16] the corner you can't he sees what's
[24:18] around the corner and therefore god
[24:20] empowers him to give his people his word
[24:23] that the word that they believe will
[24:26] tell them ahead of time before the
[24:28] corner comes what's going to come around
[24:30] the corner
[24:31] my brother my sister we know what's
[24:33] around the corner we know what to expect
[24:35] that's going to happen in the world we
[24:37] know all of that and as far as the bride
[24:39] of jesus christ we know what's around
[24:41] the corner we know that the rapture will
[24:43] be here any minute
[24:45] we know the adoptions of sun is
[24:47] happening right now we know that's
[24:49] what's around the corner we don't have
[24:51] to worry about anything as long as it's
[24:53] god's word god will stand upon his word
[24:56] but says in this message a memorial it
[24:58] says oh let me just jump ahead because
[25:01] of time he talks about this young man
[25:03] from england who was about to build a
[25:04] bridge he talks about him he says now he
[25:07] came when when something that everybody
[25:10] had rejected was afraid to do he took it
[25:13] he says why because he had a reputation
[25:16] and he put his reputation on the line he
[25:19] says there are two things that we needed
[25:21] he had a reputation and he had a vision
[25:26] reputation and vision in other words
[25:28] vision he could see
[25:30] before the breach could be built how
[25:32] everything was going to lay out he had a
[25:34] purpose in doing that and verbum says
[25:36] that the same way that jesus christ when
[25:38] he came if he if he didn't have a vision
[25:41] if he didn't know what's around the
[25:43] corner if he cannot perform that which
[25:45] he has said then god is not god
[25:49] then his reputation is on the line
[25:52] he comes this young man he says
[25:55] oh i love it it says one place it says
[25:57] he came and he put his reputation he
[25:59] says they said well people from america
[26:02] great engineers good architects they've
[26:04] received this job he says but i will
[26:06] take it
[26:08] he came in
[26:10] he went the same place that they all
[26:12] went
[26:13] he examined the river he looked at it
[26:16] and looked at it and said they all went
[26:18] to the same place
[26:20] they went down what they saw was sinned
[26:24] but whatever says he knew the way that
[26:26] god designed the earth that underneath
[26:29] that sand there had to be a rock
[26:31] somewhere
[26:32] my part of my sister
[26:34] he knew that i don't care how much sand
[26:37] there is if i continue to pump this sand
[26:40] out one day i'm gonna hit the rock
[26:42] somewhere in the bottom that's the same
[26:44] way it is with this message my father
[26:46] says it's not built upon the shifting
[26:48] sins of man the understanding of van or
[26:51] this or this that if you went in the
[26:53] bible if you went and read it one day
[26:55] god is gonna reveal it to yourself
[26:57] you're gonna hit a rock and once you hit
[27:00] a rock he will stabilize forever
[27:06] are built upon saints explanations of
[27:08] men and they heard this great art or i
[27:11] know believe oh i must be here they're
[27:13] headed over here that must be it but
[27:15] remember the church is not built upon
[27:18] men's understanding when he looked at
[27:20] peter it says upon this rock it's always
[27:23] the rock it was the rocket jordan it was
[27:25] the rock in the time of jesus it's a
[27:28] rock in the same time
[27:31] behold i lay a rock a stumbling block
[27:34] and a rock of offense he was not
[27:37] offended in me he who believes that it
[27:39] sits upon this rock what's a rock god
[27:42] choosing a man to reveal his word
[27:46] god using a man that he can come in this
[27:48] generation and turn his back against the
[27:51] audience and be accepted what is that
[27:54] that's the rock the revelation is i
[27:56] looked at the man but i saw jesus being
[27:58] manifested
[28:03] the revelation of who god is
[28:06] to you
[28:07] not to the group but to you
[28:12] oh my
[28:17] i know i'm running out a time but
[28:23] he talks about
[28:25] the other memorial it says about lot's
[28:27] wife now i thought it's very important i
[28:30] say this
[28:32] there's so many different things they
[28:34] said but just
[28:35] for the sake of time i'll just read few
[28:37] of them
[28:38] he says that wife started out as an
[28:41] overcomer
[28:43] but she never did overcome
[28:48] but but says that god used her
[28:51] as a memorial also
[28:53] the same way that the rocks that we just
[28:55] talked about in joshua was a memorial
[28:57] there is another memorial
[29:00] of lot's wife
[29:02] it says
[29:03] it says she wanted to see
[29:05] what others in the world are doing
[29:10] she wanted to have
[29:12] her hair cut
[29:16] because she looked back at the memorial
[29:18] of this grace
[29:21] who were greater it says and
[29:24] and she was a lady she wanted to be
[29:26] among the society in the city of sodom
[29:29] and and of gomorrah and sodom
[29:32] lost wife was carnal and these are part
[29:35] of i i just took they said so much of
[29:37] them i didn't have time to take all of
[29:38] it
[29:39] she started to it says she stands today
[29:43] in the field there
[29:44] as a pill of salt
[29:46] as a disgrace to those who pass
[29:50] she wanted to have a last look
[29:54] lot's wife she says at one place they
[29:56] say she merely look
[30:00] it's like it's not like she turned gum
[30:02] she merely it says oh my she merely
[30:05] looked
[30:07] she wanted to be in luxury it says one
[30:10] place
[30:11] her husband had had to become a great
[30:13] man in the city and
[30:15] and and one in this message she says she
[30:17] was just trying to be sociable
[30:25] and i want to say that to us because
[30:28] it's very important we take this
[30:30] seriously we are called to for a
[30:32] different memorial and the memorial that
[30:34] we are called to represent is cut us off
[30:37] of all those things
[30:40] we we can't be there and and still wants
[30:43] to keep all of our
[30:44] associations out of the likes
[30:47] of following all the instagrams and the
[30:50] the tick tocks and all of the the trains
[30:53] that's going on you know today it's one
[30:55] person standing on one foot tomorrow he
[30:57] has his shirt off and and all of that
[30:59] we're following
[31:02] now
[31:03] what memorial are you really trying to
[31:05] represent
[31:07] you say well it's christ but i still
[31:09] want to have fun
[31:11] the way the world is having fun
[31:16] you you go here but yet you you among
[31:20] people that are
[31:22] i'll tell you this you sit around with
[31:24] people that curse all the time
[31:26] you don't have to force it one day it's
[31:28] going to come out of your mouth
[31:30] i speak by experience
[31:36] you don't have you stay among people
[31:39] that are constantly negative negative or
[31:41] negative they're saying there's like
[31:43] this one day you don't have to you don't
[31:46] even have to have learned it
[31:48] you automatically will display it
[31:54] you you stay around you you be sociable
[31:57] enough with the world oh you know we
[31:59] just go in we're gonna just go play
[32:01] basketball and yet they are you know
[32:03] saying all kinds of things and all of
[32:05] that and and it's getting in you you say
[32:07] well as long as i don't participate at
[32:09] all don't say what they say i'm good
[32:11] you one day you'll find yourself
[32:13] repeating those same things
[32:15] and you're going to wonder what if you
[32:17] ever gone you went to a restaurant and
[32:19] sat in an ate you didn't even know what
[32:21] music was playing
[32:23] but one day out of nowhere your foot is
[32:25] moving you're like
[32:29] what's going on here
[32:32] and some tunes is us out of it in the
[32:34] subconscious not in the conscious the
[32:36] moment your conscience catches it you
[32:39] look at your foot
[32:43] it's where you've been
[32:46] oh let's be careful of what memorial we
[32:49] are presenting i'm saying this to
[32:51] encourage us so we know as our brother
[32:54] said this morning god has got everything
[32:56] under his control but what he wants us
[32:58] to do is to project the memorial that
[33:01] explains us here to do regardless of
[33:03] where i am i have to be mindful of what
[33:06] memorial i'm bringing forth
[33:10] now
[33:17] lot never thought he was going to end up
[33:19] in sodom and gomorrah
[33:22] when he left abraham he didn't pick up
[33:25] because if that was his desire he could
[33:27] have just moved there
[33:29] but all he took was for him to just have
[33:32] his tent
[33:33] pointed towards that direction
[33:40] today he saw the fireworks
[33:43] the next day he saw some light shows
[33:46] he saw some things
[33:48] and all of the sudden
[33:50] it caught his attention
[33:53] and
[33:54] maybe
[33:55] three months later
[33:57] the tank moved a little bit
[34:01] and the tank moved a little bit
[34:03] and the tank moved a little bit
[34:05] and then all of a sudden he was a
[34:07] governor a mayor
[34:12] you don't have to go and say i decide to
[34:14] go in the world
[34:16] i decide to do all of this no
[34:19] it's the association
[34:21] if it keeps continuing it's okay why
[34:23] aren't you living in victoria lives you
[34:25] too much trash
[34:27] too much association
[34:29] my mother my sister we are called but
[34:31] matthew said it this morning we are
[34:33] called to whoop the devil
[34:37] not to associate not to feel sorry for
[34:39] him we are called to kick the devil
[34:42] everywhere we meet him
[34:48] oh i don't know about you i like to see
[34:50] the devil getting kicked i like to see
[34:52] him being chased and and i'd like to see
[34:55] him without a place i wanted to see him
[34:57] out of all the children of god i want to
[35:00] see his deliverance is healing i want to
[35:02] see all of us i don't want to see the
[35:04] devil anywhere near the children of god
[35:10] but yet we are oh god oh god and god is
[35:13] looking and says i've given you my word
[35:15] there is no better weapon i can give you
[35:17] than my word is saying stand up clean

[35:22] over jordan that joshua came in and said
[35:25] sanctify yourself this day get yourself
[35:27] ready the word of god is going before
[35:29] you but once the word of god is already
[35:32] pronounced i've given you the land
[35:36] we've been given the land why don't we
[35:38] have the land
[35:40] then amen

[35:46] cutting off the things of the world well
[35:48] then you know it's just a game you know
[35:51] it's just a football game it's just just
[35:53] a basketball game you know
[35:55] and then before you know it's five hours
[35:57] in
[35:59] great achievement

[36:41] i want to be a memorial
[36:43] i want if somebody called me and said
[36:45] brother we need you to come here and
[36:46] pray i want when i show up i am certain
[36:50] that all heaven is with me
[36:52] i don't want to be one that was playing
[36:54] games and then they called me i go oh
[36:56] god oh god help me
[37:02] that's what we do we are in complete
[37:04] distraction then when something happens
[37:07] oh we want the blood we want this i mean
[37:09] we want everything we want it right
[37:11] there no he wants us to be ready we are
[37:14] in a battle he wants you to be ready at
[37:16] all times
[37:23] i have given you the land
[37:27] it's a memorial when your children ask
[37:29] you
[37:30] as your son ever ask you your daughter
[37:32] ask you something you have no idea how
[37:34] to answer because you haven't been
[37:36] practicing
[37:40] that way daddy aren't we supposed to be
[37:41] praying all day is i
[37:43] yeah son but you know
[37:46] daddy got a little bit busy
[37:51] something happening
[37:54] i want to be ready i want to run to it
[37:55] god what would you have me do
[37:58] what would you want me to do if he calls
[38:00] me or if he tells me now condemnation is
[38:02] always going to be there regardless of
[38:04] where it's always going to be there but
[38:06] i don't want to be to have something
[38:08] that i have caused by my own hands
[38:11] i want to do what my part is and let god
[38:14] do his part like we say
[38:18] people that are sanctified ready to take
[38:20] the battle ready to possess the land
[38:22] wherever it's needed
[38:24] people that are ready to speak the word
[38:27] if the musician could come
[38:49] god's building and god is building a
[38:51] memorial
[38:53] is god is building a church
[38:56] as a memorial
[38:59] a memorial of his
[39:01] sacrifice
[39:03] christ never come to earth paragraph 35
[39:06] christ never come to earth to die in
[39:08] vain
[39:09] his death will not be in vain god's able
[39:13] for these stones to ray to rise children
[39:16] of abraham if people won't leave it they
[39:19] won't take it into under consider under
[39:22] consideration and realize what a great
[39:24] gift god is giving them god's is able
[39:28] of these stones
[39:29] to rise to raise children of abraham
[39:33] truly he will do that
[39:36] so i say today brothers the things to do
[39:39] is the word is the things to do it says
[39:42] the words that you say paragraph 31
[39:45] how you you treat your brother
[39:48] what you do about christ
[39:50] will be an everlasting memorial
[39:54] you might you might have a fine home to
[39:56] live in
[39:58] to live to your children you might have
[40:01] you might have been working for some
[40:03] livelihood to live to your children but
[40:05] i'd rather leave them the word of god
[40:08] than anything else
[40:09] those houses will vanish that's
[40:12] perfectly right it says that's perfect
[40:14] you're right that's good i have nothing
[40:17] against it but don't do those minor
[40:19] things and leave the great things
[40:22] undone
[40:23] you see because the word
[40:26] that says the word will it says the
[40:28] house will perish the people will perish
[40:30] with it but god's word
[40:33] but the word of god will will raise them
[40:35] up in the last day and give them
[40:38] an eternal
[40:40] and immortal
[40:42] life again
[40:46] examine your own memorial
[40:51] remember it consists of what you do
[40:55] your works not what you say
[40:58] and i'm not saying this in condemnation
[41:00] so to say
[41:03] you don't have it you don't have it i
[41:05] said it's been given to us
[41:08] to do it
[41:09] the scripture says to them it's not
[41:11] given but to you it's getting given when
[41:14] something is given it means it's yours
[41:17] to possess to exercise when something
[41:20] has been given to you it means it's in
[41:22] your power in your authority casting out
[41:24] devil is not something we need to say oh
[41:27] god we need you to go do it no it's
[41:29] something that's been given to you
[41:32] if you sanctify yourself if you get
[41:34] yourself ready if you kick out the trial
[41:37] you have the authority to perform the
[41:39] work in fact it says one place oh i love
[41:42] it it says you speak the word and then
[41:44] it says the holy spirit is the enforcer
[41:47] he takes the word and he runs through
[41:49] the level and says get out of here why
[41:51] because the owner is calling for it
[41:58] amen let's stand
[42:11] oh i
[42:14] say he said he had a vision
[42:18] before a man can make a repetition he
[42:20] has to have a vision
[42:22] of what he's doing
[42:24] oh blessed be the lord
[42:27] that's the reason he says
[42:29] you are it says there are
[42:31] they are in heaven
[42:33] there is in heaven to go to
[42:36] that's the reason we can have a
[42:37] reputation as a christian
[42:39] we know what material is in the
[42:42] building that's right the blood of jesus
[42:46] jesus christ is in the building that's
[42:48] right
[42:49] he stained the blood
[42:51] has washed away all sins he took me from
[42:55] the alley of hell and
[42:57] made me a servant
[42:59] then i believe in him
[43:01] so i pass from death to life
[43:04] and every believer
[43:06] has done as did that
[43:08] because he asked
[43:10] because
[43:12] that they had to go that they that they
[43:15] got confidence and they believe in the
[43:17] great builder
[43:18] in the
[43:19] in this great architect
[43:21] the process
[43:24] it says paragraph 43 says now
[43:27] when the man did this the first thing
[43:29] that he did to be sure that he was right
[43:32] he went down
[43:34] and he said now before
[43:36] we get the bridge to start started we
[43:40] got to go to the solid foundation we've
[43:42] got to go
[43:44] we've got to go
[43:46] he knew that down beneath the sand
[43:48] the rest of the earth
[43:51] was

[48:39] uh uh
[48:41] we we we always want to be in a position
[48:43] where we're ready
[48:45] and it just it come to my my heart as he
[48:48] was talking about that you know when
[48:50] when the prophet would preach the token
[48:52] i believe he preaches the token uh
[48:53] september 1st 1963
[48:56] he preaches the token
[48:58] and what a glorious message i believe
[49:00] even the prophet mitch that's like one
[49:02] of the uh one of the capping or it was
[49:04] one of the his great messages and and
[49:07] you know what he preaches that evening
[49:08] preaches desperation if you want the
[49:11] token
[49:12] if you want the token life
[49:14] if you want an everlasting memorial if
[49:16] you want christ
[49:17] the everlasting memorial if you want to
[49:19] be a lively stone we got to get into
[49:21] desperation
[49:23] but but sadly
[49:25] you know brother branham talks about how

[49:29] takes tragedy or it takes trial it takes
[49:32] things to get us into a place of
[49:35] desperation but as our brother was
[49:37] ministering i don't i don't want it to
[49:38] have to take tragedy
