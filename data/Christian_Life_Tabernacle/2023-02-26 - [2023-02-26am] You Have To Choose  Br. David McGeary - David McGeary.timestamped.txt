[15:08] reading this morning amen
[15:31] good morning
[15:34] it was uh
[15:36] watching some little Clips this week in
[15:38] the news about
[15:40] maybe you heard about it but it's uh
[15:43] you know a Revival that's been going on
[15:45] at Asbury University
[15:48] you know it's been happening out in
[15:50] Kentucky and earlier this month it was
[15:52] you know what started out as a chapel
[15:54] service
[15:56] you know you had all of these a group of
[15:58] students that
[16:00] you know just spontaneously began to
[16:02] Worship the Lord
[16:04] and began a praise and worship service
[16:07] that lasted for two weeks
[16:09] non-stop two weeks of of
[16:13] praise from these college students
[16:15] sometimes fifteen thousand at a time
[16:19] you know and I
[16:21] watched as these young people would step
[16:24] out of this service
[16:26] you know speaking of how they had
[16:28] experienced the presence of the Lord
[16:31] how they had become lost
[16:33] in the worship how their lives had been
[16:36] changed
[16:39] you know for two weeks this revival was
[16:41] all the buzz
[16:43] in the Christian Community
[16:45] you know and finally after two weeks the
[16:47] university shut it down so everybody
[16:49] could get back to their studies
[16:52] and I was thinking about that you know
[16:54] on the surface that sounds like such a
[16:55] wonderful thing
[16:58] you know
[16:59] as they said surely the presence of the
[17:01] Lord must have been there in some
[17:02] capacity right I heard them use the
[17:05] scripture
[17:06] Psalm 22 3 which says the Lord it habits
[17:09] the praise of his people
[17:12] you know young people spontaneously
[17:14] worshiping the Lord
[17:18] but you know it's completely taken out
[17:20] of context the way that they use the
[17:22] verse and
[17:24] you know the one thing that was missing
[17:26] from that entire Revival
[17:28] was the word
[17:31] in spite of all the powerful services
[17:35] you know in spite of all the
[17:37] endless hours of praise and worship
[17:42] emotional intensity that may have
[17:44] occurred in those meetings
[17:47] the evidence of the presence of the Lord
[17:49] is his word
[17:52] and it was the one thing that could not
[17:54] be found through that entire Revival
[17:59] you know as an experience certainly
[18:02] there was some kind of presence there
[18:04] certainly
[18:05] you know something moved on the people's
[18:08] hearts but the image
[18:12] that resulted did not reflect the word
[18:18] no no doubt the worship felt very good
[18:22] it doesn't necessarily mean he was
[18:25] present
[18:26] or even pleased
[18:28] with what was happening there
[18:31] you know Revival is one of those words
[18:33] that get thrown around
[18:36] basically to mean everything from
[18:39] powerful worship services to alter calls
[18:43] and prayer lines to special meetings
[18:45] with compelling preachers and stirring
[18:48] messages but
[18:50] you know you can have all of those
[18:52] things
[18:55] without any Reviving actually going on
[18:59] sometimes it can even distract people
[19:02] from having
[19:04] a real Revival
[19:07] and you can experience your Revival
[19:11] without having any of that
[19:13] and many do
[19:16] you know the word revive is used only in
[19:18] the Old Testament
[19:20] the New Testament word is to Quicken
[19:24] the word means and they looked it up in
[19:26] the dictionary to live
[19:29] to have life
[19:32] to remain alive
[19:35] to sustain life
[19:38] to live prosperously
[19:41] to live forever
[19:44] to be quickened
[19:47] to be alive
[19:49] to be restored to life
[19:52] or health
[19:54] it's not about praising
[19:57] it's not about preaching
[19:59] it's about living
[20:02] not the activity or of a praise or
[20:05] worship service though we certainly
[20:07] enjoy those
[20:10] but it's the result of one coming
[20:14] and quickening life in you
[20:18] his life not your natural life
[20:22] it's to be
[20:25] quickened to that Eternal
[20:28] self-sustaining life
[20:32] which itself can impart life
[20:37] it's not the state of being constantly
[20:39] jump started
[20:40] but it's the state of being plugged in
[20:42] constantly to a never-ending source of
[20:46] power
[20:49] you know I was reading about that we're
[20:50] going to turn to Psalm 146 this morning
[20:52] there's an interesting statement that
[20:54] the scripture makes there
[20:58] starts out in verse 1 it says praise ye
[21:00] the Lord
[21:02] praise the Lord O my soul
[21:07] not my lips
[21:09] not my words not my voice but my soul
[21:16] while I live
[21:19] will I praise the Lord
[21:21] I will sing praises to the Lord while I
[21:24] have any being
[21:26] you know first Peter 2 9 says it this
[21:28] way
[21:29] but you're a chosen generation
[21:31] a royal priesthood and holy nation
[21:35] A peculiar people that ye should show
[21:39] forth
[21:41] the Praises of him who hath called you
[21:44] out of Darkness
[21:46] into His Marvelous Light
[21:49] you know you look at something like that
[21:51] Revival at Asbury University
[21:54] or really any movement
[21:58] you know that makes Revival the act of
[22:00] having a powerful church service
[22:04] we miss what it means to offer the kind
[22:06] of Praise he's looking for
[22:10] the kind of Praise that truly
[22:12] demonstrates the presence of the Lord
[22:16] you know it isn't Revival because we
[22:19] praise loud enough
[22:21] or long enough or powerful enough in a
[22:24] church service
[22:26] Revival is an Awakening of a certain
[22:30] kind of life in US
[22:33] his life
[22:35] that causes us to praise him with our
[22:38] soul
[22:40] with our life
[22:43] by living and expressing his life while
[22:48] I live will I praise thee
[22:51] we praise him
[22:54] you know it's
[22:56] says in Romans 12 1 I beseech you
[22:59] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[23:01] that you present your bodies a living
[23:05] sacrifice
[23:08] that's Revival
[23:09] the kind of Praise that is living
[23:14] the kind of Praise that is shown forth
[23:17] by making him known in our lives
[23:21] that which comes from the soul on
[23:24] Tuesday
[23:25] not from the lips on Sunday
[23:30] you know certainly we enjoy those High
[23:31] these times of getting together and
[23:33] worshiping and praising the Lord for he
[23:35] is certainly worthy of our praise
[23:40] you know but Revival is Awakening of a
[23:43] life of praise
[23:45] not having a church service of praise
[23:48] as it says in First Peter 2 5 ye also as
[23:51] Lively stones
[23:54] are built up a spiritual house and holy
[23:57] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[23:59] sacrifices acceptable by Jesus Christ
[24:03] that word Lively means alive living to
[24:06] have life
[24:09] Living Praise not just singing Praise
[24:13] you know as it says in second
[24:15] Corinthians 3 2 that each of us are an
[24:17] epistle
[24:19] a letter
[24:21] a message
[24:23] a song
[24:25] read of all men while I live
[24:30] work
[24:33] if I have been revived
[24:37] am I praising him
[24:40] you know as we read Psalm 146 this
[24:42] morning we can go ahead and stand
[24:45] you know the question is while we live
[24:48] do we praise him
[24:50] do we praise him by our living
[24:53] does our soul Praise Him
[24:56] is our life a song of Praise written of
[25:01] him
[25:03] you know there's a people somewhere
[25:06] yeah and I believe they're in this room
[25:10] who know what it means to have been
[25:12] revived
[25:15] who have encountered who have
[25:16] encountered an awakener
[25:19] someone who has
[25:22] created some life in them caused
[25:25] something to rise up
[25:27] that they may be a life of praise
[25:32] want to know what Revival looks like
[25:35] it looks something like that
[25:37] let's go ahead and read Psalm 146 this
[25:40] morning it's just a short psalm
[25:42] praise ye the Lord praise the Lord O My
[25:46] Soul while I live will I praise the Lord
[25:49] I will sing praises unto my God while I
[25:52] have any being put not your trust in
[25:55] princes nor in the son of man in whom
[25:58] there is no help his breath goeth forth
[26:01] he returneth to his Earth in that very
[26:04] day his thoughts perish happy is he that
[26:07] hath the god of Jacob for his help whose
[26:10] hope is in the Lord his God which made
[26:13] Heaven and Earth the sea and all that
[26:16] therein is which keepeth truth forever
[26:19] which executeth judgment for the
[26:21] oppressed which giveth food to the
[26:24] hungry the Lord luceth the Prisoners the
[26:27] Lord openeth the eyes of the blind the
[26:30] Lord raised them that are bowed down the
[26:32] Lord loveth the righteous the Lord
[26:35] preserveth The Strangers he relieveth
[26:37] the fatherless and Widow but the Way of
[26:40] the Wicked he turneth upside down
[26:42] the Lord shall reign forever even thy
[26:45] God o Zion unto all generations praise
[26:49] ye the Lord r
[26:53] and God bless you have your seats
[26:56] I believe we can praise him this morning
[26:58] amen

[27:06] dwell oh and no freedom from my sorrow I

[51:02] amen I just appreciated it so very much
[51:05] I also very much enjoyed what uh brother
[51:10] Mike said this morning about the great
[51:14] Revival and what it was lacking I
[51:17] thought that was extremely beautifully
[51:20] put and well done this morning do you
[51:23] love the Lord this morning let's open
[51:25] our Bibles and trust that
[51:29] we can get our little thought across
[51:33] this morning
[51:35] um to you and it'll encourage you and
[51:40] increase your your understanding of the
[51:44] Lord we're going to read out of Joshua
[51:48] the
[51:49] 24th chapter of the Book of Joshua and
[51:53] uh the 14th verse
[51:59] I love the Book of Joshua
[52:02] um
[52:03] in fact
[52:05] one of my uh
[52:09] favorite
[52:10] uh scriptures in the Bible is found in
[52:15] in uh
[52:18] Joshua 1 and 9 and I remember I had that
[52:22] uh
[52:23] where they put that little I think it's
[52:26] not are you kind of needlepoint I think
[52:29] they caught I had that needle pointed on
[52:32] a plaque for me it says have not I
[52:34] commanded thee to be strong and of good
[52:37] courage
[52:38] and Be not Afraid neither be thou
[52:41] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[52:45] thee wherever thou goest amen and that
[52:49] would be my blessing to us this morning
[52:53] also God's with us
[52:55] oh well you know that that God's with us
[52:58] men and uh and we've we're definitely
[53:02] going to have to know that and be
[53:05] confident of that as we Forge forward in
[53:09] what God has for us remember Satan is
[53:13] not going to let it be an easy Road
[53:16] but he stands to resist and we'll talk
[53:19] about that this morning now this is
[53:21] Joshua speaking after the he's come to
[53:24] the end the land's been divided up and
[53:28] he begins to say these great words
[53:31] he says now therefore fear the lord
[53:35] amen the fear of the Lord is the
[53:37] beginning of wisdom
[53:39] I remember in all things you do fear the
[53:43] lord in other words how is what that I'm
[53:47] doing
[53:48] how does it stand and does it meet the
[53:52] approval of God in his eyes amen
[53:56] therefore fear the lord
[53:58] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[54:06] sincerity and in truth
[54:10] and put away
[54:13] the gods which your father served on the
[54:17] other side of the flood
[54:20] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[54:26] amen I want to kind of lay emphas here
[54:29] I'm put away the Gods
[54:34] and he tells you he says
[54:36] um
[54:37] and if it seemed evil
[54:41] unto you to serve the Lord
[54:44] choose ye this day whom ye will serve
[54:52] whether the gods of your fathers
[54:55] and we have the gods of our fathers in
[54:59] this day so we've been studying out of
[55:02] that message
[55:03] whether the gods of your fathers serve
[55:07] that were on the other side of the flood
[55:10] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[55:14] land ye dwelt but as for me and my house
[55:18] we will serve the Lord God bless you
[55:22] this morning you may be seated and
[55:25] and we are uh we've been studying out of
[55:30] the God of this evil age
[55:33] and I want you to notice here that we
[55:37] understand as Bible Believers and one of
[55:40] the things that I think becomes a a real
[55:45] rich
[55:46] uh Revelation for us is that God always
[55:52] continues
[55:54] using the same pattern because he's an
[55:58] infinite God and so that means if he
[56:01] makes a choice he can't make a wrong
[56:04] choice he can't choose to do something
[56:07] and then come up with a better way to do
[56:10] it he he doesn't have to think over his
[56:15] decisions and his choices because he's
[56:18] the Fountain of all knowledge and so
[56:22] just by his very essence of what that is
[56:26] when he does something since he's the
[56:30] author and finisher of all things and he
[56:33] knows the beginning from the end when he
[56:36] does a pattern or he does something then
[56:40] he can stay with that all the way
[56:41] through and everything else you find in
[56:45] the scriptures will follow the same
[56:48] pattern so we understand that this is
[56:51] the uh the Book of Joshua is at the end
[56:56] of
[56:58] the first Exodus
[57:00] there was an exodus and we know that in
[57:04] the Old Testament all these things have
[57:06] been given to us and shadows in in types
[57:10] that by these shadows and types we might
[57:13] be able to look back and see the hand of
[57:16] God With God you can look back and see
[57:20] what that he's done and then be able to
[57:23] look forward and know what he's going to
[57:25] do and you can also know what he's doing
[57:28] because he's the same yesterday today
[57:31] and forever so we can look back at
[57:35] Exodus and we can see in the book of
[57:38] Exodus the what transpired the children
[57:42] of Egypt came out of bondage right they
[57:45] were led by task Masters because they
[57:49] left the land where that they would
[57:52] prosper and they went into
[57:56] a land which uh
[57:59] invited him in and we know the story of
[58:02] Joseph and and they became
[58:05] prosperous there and they were well but
[58:08] their rose up somebody that didn't know
[58:10] that pharaoh and then soon it'll be
[58:14] brought into they were brought into
[58:17] bondage and we know that Egypt is a type
[58:20] of the world so many times I've seen it
[58:23] that a Christian it seems like the world
[58:26] will offer them an opportunity and to
[58:30] prosper and they'll they'll they'll move
[58:33] somewhere or they'll take something or
[58:35] they'll change their hours and pretty
[58:38] soon that they're there and they're
[58:40] blessed and it looks like a blessing and
[58:42] it's not long pretty soon they've come
[58:45] into captivity into that job they no
[58:48] longer can go to church they they no
[58:51] longer can have Fellowship they no
[58:53] matter what they're getting paid they
[58:55] find themselves in financial battles
[58:58] they they're trying to keep up the pace
[59:00] and the pressure starts to set in on
[59:03] them and all of a sudden because the
[59:06] they they took the job is a blessing but
[59:08] that job didn't know the god that they
[59:12] sure
[59:13] that's right and so they they fall into
[59:16] bondage so we understand in this Exodus
[59:19] that the children of Israel had fallen
[59:22] into bondage and and they but by and by
[59:25] the very reasons of their taskbasters
[59:28] they begin to cry out to God you know uh
[59:32] it it was fine they didn't really as
[59:35] long as there was food on the table and
[59:37] they were making money and doing
[59:39] business you know it seems like God gets
[59:42] puts on the Shelf it always is it's
[59:44] terrible isn't it that man's always got
[59:47] to get desperate to before they call out
[59:50] for the Lord
[59:52] and you know backsliding is is is not a
[59:57] one-day affair
[59:59] it's it's a slow tedious process
[1:00:05] and you know that's what uh in the
[1:00:10] manufacturing industry and things like
[1:00:13] that they have something that they call
[1:00:15] periodical maintenance that you've got
[1:00:18] to go maintain things so you know you go
[1:00:20] you go add the lube you go change the
[1:00:23] belt you go do all these little things
[1:00:25] you know whether it's almost like
[1:00:28] whether they need it or not because you
[1:00:30] know if you don't keep it up
[1:00:33] the fatigue will eventually break it
[1:00:36] down
[1:00:37] and in our life we've got to understand
[1:00:40] that we've got to have a spiritual
[1:00:42] maintenance program going on you've got
[1:00:46] to you've got to spend the time you've
[1:00:48] got to take the time you know they've
[1:00:51] got to take the time to shut the machine
[1:00:53] down and check it out and do it and all
[1:00:55] that and and spend some time on it well
[1:00:58] you got to spend time on your spiritual
[1:01:00] life too you've got to say take some
[1:01:03] time and and shut it down and and sit
[1:01:07] back and grab your bible and say Lord
[1:01:10] speak to me
[1:01:11] not just not just read your Bible but
[1:01:14] say Lord I'm reading the Bible this
[1:01:16] morning with the intention of you
[1:01:19] speaking to my spirit
[1:01:21] uh to correct me or to show me something
[1:01:24] to to give me some Enlightenment this
[1:01:27] morning I I need and then you need to
[1:01:30] spend time of getting into the presence
[1:01:33] of the Lord uh just just letting his
[1:01:37] presence inviting his presence you know
[1:01:40] there's nothing sweeter than the
[1:01:41] presence of the Lord
[1:01:44] you can go a lot of time on Willpower
[1:01:47] and you can go a lot of time on your
[1:01:49] knowledge but you've you pretty soon you
[1:01:52] you know what's truth but you don't feel
[1:01:55] the joy of the Lord and the presence of
[1:01:58] the Lord you got to take time to to set
[1:02:02] aside time just for the presence of the
[1:02:04] Lord
[1:02:07] just just stop
[1:02:09] and invite the presence of the Lord and
[1:02:12] and just tell you feel his presence and
[1:02:17] then you start thinking of what he's
[1:02:19] done for you and how good he has been to
[1:02:22] you all that you have and how he's
[1:02:24] preserved you and that's good but then
[1:02:27] you start thinking about where he's
[1:02:28] taking you oh my he's taken me to a land
[1:02:32] beyond the river he's taken to me where
[1:02:34] there's no death no sickness no pain
[1:02:37] he's taking me a place where I'll have
[1:02:40] life Everlasting and always we start
[1:02:43] looking through that gas glass darkening
[1:02:45] you know what you'll find out is is the
[1:02:48] things the light begins to shine things
[1:02:50] aren't dark anymore your spirit's lifted
[1:02:53] up you're refreshed
[1:02:55] and you you've got you've got to spend
[1:02:58] that time to do a spiritual uh a a
[1:03:03] maintenance or or you know things will
[1:03:06] break down
[1:03:08] and so we find out here that
[1:03:11] this Exodus was a natural Exodus
[1:03:16] from a natural land and so we we
[1:03:18] understand that in our day Egypt typed
[1:03:21] the world
[1:03:22] the coming out of the world
[1:03:26] and they left a land of bondage of sin
[1:03:32] and and of task Masters and a grueling
[1:03:36] uh
[1:03:38] uh just a grueling lifestyle and God
[1:03:42] sent them a deliverer
[1:03:45] and they were delivered out of the land
[1:03:48] and then they ended up in the land of
[1:03:52] promise
[1:03:54] and so they made that place but what I
[1:03:57] wanted to point out this morning
[1:04:00] it for our understanding this morning
[1:04:03] for to let us understand that where we
[1:04:07] are Joshua sat all the people down and
[1:04:12] said to him he said you are going to
[1:04:16] have to choose
[1:04:19] right
[1:04:21] look and and uh so that was a
[1:04:27] characteristic or a typed of of the
[1:04:33] people being brought out being brought
[1:04:35] out wasn't the final
[1:04:38] decision or the end of it what the
[1:04:42] broading bringing out did for them or
[1:04:45] what it did it placed them in the in the
[1:04:50] place of choice
[1:04:52] now you have going you are he's looking
[1:04:55] out at the children of Egypt and and
[1:04:59] Joshua being the great uh Prophet that
[1:05:03] he was he said no children of Israel
[1:05:06] here you are in this land but you are
[1:05:10] going to have to choose whom you're
[1:05:12] going to serve
[1:05:15] and if you follow the history of the
[1:05:18] children of Israel what do you find out
[1:05:21] there was many times that they they
[1:05:23] failed to choose the Lord and they chose
[1:05:26] something else if every time that they
[1:05:29] chose something else they found
[1:05:32] themselves in a very desperate Place God
[1:05:35] pressing them to get back to him and had
[1:05:40] calling to him repent and return to the
[1:05:44] god of your father
[1:05:49] so we can look back at that Exodus
[1:05:54] and we can truly see in the word of God
[1:05:58] that we are now in an exodus
[1:06:02] we understand the Exodus of coming out
[1:06:05] from law
[1:06:07] to Grace
[1:06:09] where the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:11] came in the spirit of the Lord now let
[1:06:14] the price for sin was paid now man could
[1:06:18] enter into fellowship and that Spirit
[1:06:20] could come dwell within man because
[1:06:23] there was a blood sacrifice paid for
[1:06:26] them that made them righteous
[1:06:30] now that's a beautiful thing about
[1:06:32] Calvary to me
[1:06:35] Calvary is a daily invitation to the
[1:06:40] believer to come have fellowship with
[1:06:42] God
[1:06:44] it's an open door for Fellowship
[1:06:48] there's a the blood that was was spilled
[1:06:51] at Calvary it it was typed in the first
[1:06:55] Exodus as being placed on the doorpost
[1:06:59] right the little post that if you came
[1:07:02] in through that door that had the blood
[1:07:07] on it on the other side there was safety
[1:07:10] and peace
[1:07:13] and it's the same thing if you find
[1:07:16] yourself on the outside of that door the
[1:07:20] angel of death it is going
[1:07:24] but that door is still there as an
[1:07:28] entrance into peace and safety
[1:07:32] you say how do you go through that door
[1:07:34] it's so simple you walk to that door you
[1:07:37] confess your sins and then you step
[1:07:40] through that blood into the door of the
[1:07:43] life and peace of the Lamb
[1:07:47] and what did they do in there they ate
[1:07:50] the lamb
[1:07:52] right a type of the word they got in
[1:07:55] there and they Fellowship around the
[1:07:57] evening meal oh what is this come unto
[1:08:01] you and behold thy stand at the door
[1:08:03] knock anyone opens I'll come in and sup
[1:08:06] with them and he with me and you'll sit
[1:08:09] down and we'll have the evening meal
[1:08:12] okay okay it's beautiful uh where it is
[1:08:17] that we set today in our hour so we we
[1:08:22] saw that this great
[1:08:24] Exodus and The Exodus from the law into
[1:08:28] Grace and into the leadership of the
[1:08:31] Holy Spirit
[1:08:33] and and in every age there was a choice
[1:08:40] so now we have come down to our Exodus
[1:08:47] all everyone I could go through many
[1:08:50] more types because you can look at the
[1:08:53] first Exodus and you'll see the pattern
[1:08:55] what did he do he gathered the children
[1:08:58] together is that right
[1:09:01] what did he do on this the next as he
[1:09:03] gathered them together in the upper room
[1:09:05] didn't he it's okay it's always that and
[1:09:08] what has he done this morning
[1:09:11] he's gathered his pride together
[1:09:14] we know that right it's a United time
[1:09:17] and sign he's Gathering his bride
[1:09:19] together he's gathered his bride
[1:09:22] together because he's preparing her for
[1:09:25] an exodus
[1:09:30] but also
[1:09:33] at the same time
[1:09:36] she has got to understand
[1:09:39] that she has to choose
[1:09:43] right
[1:09:44] it wouldn't it would be unfair to the
[1:09:47] children if he said choose this day
[1:09:51] whom you'll serve
[1:09:55] in the days of the Gospel going forward
[1:09:58] if those people had to make a choice
[1:10:03] just like Paul on the mountain of Mars
[1:10:05] he went up there and he said oh I see
[1:10:07] you got all these Gods you worship let
[1:10:10] me tell you about a God he said you calm
[1:10:13] the unknown God but I know him
[1:10:16] and this is the only true God whom you
[1:10:21] must serve see they had to choose
[1:10:25] they had to choose and we
[1:10:28] are also so now we've been studying this
[1:10:32] sermon the God of this evil age
[1:10:36] and we've watched our Prophet expressed
[1:10:39] to us and show us that there that he is
[1:10:46] the God of this evil age it's the only
[1:10:50] age that he was ever called the god of
[1:10:55] and he is a god of uh that he is uh
[1:11:03] he he's he's just a god of civilization
[1:11:07] and education we know that in the garden
[1:11:10] that what he offered Eve he offered her
[1:11:15] civilization and and education and
[1:11:19] knowledge and he he did all these things
[1:11:22] he's presenting now we are presented
[1:11:25] with all those things in this hour in a
[1:11:29] great maturity
[1:11:31] and so we understood as we study this
[1:11:34] and as we went through it
[1:11:37] we we begin to understand that uh if I
[1:11:42] can just I'd like to maybe just read a
[1:11:45] few things to us so we can get the
[1:11:49] picture is that
[1:11:52] Satan that all of us have in Avenues
[1:11:57] right and so we we understand that that
[1:12:01] that there's uh we're made up out of
[1:12:06] five outward census and and in inward
[1:12:09] censuses of emotions and and uh
[1:12:14] reasoning and thinking and all all these
[1:12:18] great elements that were made out of
[1:12:22] and we know that those are the Avenues
[1:12:25] by which
[1:12:27] Satan
[1:12:28] approaches people
[1:12:31] not just you
[1:12:34] all people
[1:12:39] out there today have not come to
[1:12:43] conclusions by themselves
[1:12:48] and that means so as I read this I just
[1:12:51] would like you to say to understand this
[1:12:54] he said
[1:12:56] he says but he said the outside man
[1:13:00] is a physical being which is controlled
[1:13:04] by six senses or five senses rather
[1:13:08] the Inside Man is the spirit man which
[1:13:12] is controlled by five senses conscience
[1:13:15] love and so forth these this outside man
[1:13:19] see taste here and smell
[1:13:22] so here you are right hear this being
[1:13:25] you've got these Insight senses you've
[1:13:27] got these outside senses and and and so
[1:13:32] that's uh that that's what it it it's
[1:13:36] con it's controlled by he says and you
[1:13:40] cannot he said you cannot accept what
[1:13:43] the devil says or accept what God says
[1:13:46] that's all determined by what spirit is
[1:13:50] in there
[1:13:52] and
[1:13:54] and so we we begin to see that what
[1:13:58] happens is is that there is a that in
[1:14:02] this inward man and this Spirit man that
[1:14:06] you are this man is placed in it in a a
[1:14:12] position
[1:14:14] where they going to have to make a
[1:14:17] choice
[1:14:21] whether or not you're going to listen to
[1:14:23] the outward census the emotional senses
[1:14:27] or you're going to listen to that Spirit
[1:14:29] word that's in you Malco I and so as we
[1:14:34] talk about this just for a moment he
[1:14:37] says he says
[1:14:39] uh because we want to
[1:14:42] place this in this understanding of
[1:14:46] choosing you've got to understand what's
[1:14:49] being presented what's the choice
[1:14:53] that's being presented to you
[1:14:56] because we know that there's there's two
[1:15:00] opposing spirits in the world today at
[1:15:04] work
[1:15:07] there's two opposing spirits
[1:15:10] at work
[1:15:15] there's the spirit of Satan
[1:15:18] and the spirit of God
[1:15:20] so let's understand that this morning
[1:15:22] let's just don't let that slip away you
[1:15:25] are in a battle
[1:15:29] there's a war going on
[1:15:32] there's two spirits
[1:15:35] two opposing spirits
[1:15:38] you have the spirit of the God of this
[1:15:42] evil age
[1:15:43] who is trying to build the kingdom
[1:15:47] that places him up upon the throne to be
[1:15:52] worshiped and we know that this is the
[1:15:56] age that he takes his place on that
[1:15:58] throne and he's worshiped by millions
[1:16:02] and billions of people and you say well
[1:16:05] I'm not worshiping saying they don't
[1:16:07] know it
[1:16:09] because they're worshiping him through
[1:16:12] what his kingdoms made out of Science
[1:16:15] Education
[1:16:19] knowledge
[1:16:21] and smart scientific
[1:16:26] so they're
[1:16:28] worshiping him
[1:16:29] by their choice
[1:16:32] of what it is that they choose
[1:16:39] there's two choices
[1:16:43] the word of God
[1:16:47] or the tree of knowledge
[1:16:50] the mixed tree
[1:16:52] of Good and Evil that's the choices that
[1:16:57] are they every day there's there there's
[1:17:00] a a decision so these two spirits that
[1:17:04] they're they and you got to remember
[1:17:05] these two Spirits are working and these
[1:17:09] two Spirits are up opposite
[1:17:12] they are opposing one another
[1:17:18] they're they're opposing one another
[1:17:21] Satan is fighting the word of God he and
[1:17:26] and look at us today and because I want
[1:17:29] you to understand this Satan is throwing
[1:17:31] everything he's got
[1:17:34] you
[1:17:37] never he's pulling out all the stops
[1:17:39] today everything he can come up with
[1:17:42] everything for the census everything for
[1:17:45] the emotions everything he can throw at
[1:17:49] you this it's come down to the wire
[1:17:53] the battle song
[1:17:55] he's fighting he he's fighting to take
[1:17:59] control there's two opposing Spirits
[1:18:03] fighting to take control
[1:18:08] now
[1:18:10] it looks like he's winning
[1:18:14] huh
[1:18:16] I like Satan he's so dumb he don't know
[1:18:19] the word of God
[1:18:22] he's not going to win
[1:18:25] amen because God's got a people here
[1:18:29] but come back we we don't want to be
[1:18:32] ignorant because if we understand that
[1:18:35] where where we are now we are actually
[1:18:38] in a time where these two opposing
[1:18:43] Spirits are at battle
[1:18:47] they're at War and we know where that
[1:18:50] battle is taking place don't we in other
[1:18:53] words we know that the the battle is
[1:18:56] taking place in the the the minds of the
[1:19:01] believer
[1:19:03] or in the minds of the people
[1:19:06] and we know what the battle is
[1:19:09] so he's throwing everything he's got the
[1:19:12] God of this evil age is throwing
[1:19:15] everything he's got at the believer
[1:19:19] everything scientific everything
[1:19:22] knowledge smart educated everything that
[1:19:27] he can throw against the believer to
[1:19:31] disprove God's word
[1:19:35] so if you if you're at a if you're
[1:19:38] opposing something
[1:19:40] and you're at battle with something
[1:19:44] then the the the the purpose of a war is
[1:19:50] to overcome
[1:19:52] and to take rule
[1:19:56] over
[1:19:59] I know we got a war going on in Europe
[1:20:01] or one country wants to take over the
[1:20:04] other country and the other country is
[1:20:07] resisting but this country wants to take
[1:20:09] care of it and they're battling and it's
[1:20:11] going on and you sit back well and you
[1:20:15] try to uh make sense out of it all which
[1:20:18] a Believer really can't except for by
[1:20:21] one thing there shall be wars and rumors
[1:20:25] of wars
[1:20:27] it's an Evidence
[1:20:30] to the believer
[1:20:32] that we are in an exodus and these two
[1:20:37] Spirits are opposing one another and we
[1:20:42] are placed in the place of making a
[1:20:46] choice
[1:20:48] thank you
[1:20:50] see you can't leave that part out
[1:20:55] if if if it sat still
[1:20:59] another if it was too
[1:21:02] uh
[1:21:04] I guess they call are these called
[1:21:06] inanimate objects or adamant objects
[1:21:10] they're in adamant and all right I
[1:21:14] didn't know that I thought they would be
[1:21:15] adamant right
[1:21:17] because something that in other words
[1:21:19] if you only had a choice
[1:21:22] of two set things
[1:21:25] that weren't moving
[1:21:28] in other words this remained the same
[1:21:31] all the time and this remained all the
[1:21:34] same and all you had to do was make a
[1:21:37] choice of drinking this or drinking that
[1:21:41] or using this or using that that choice
[1:21:45] would be simple
[1:21:48] and it could be made one time
[1:21:54] you understand I've already made the
[1:21:57] choice you know what I mean I know what
[1:21:59] kind of soap I use
[1:22:01] you know what I mean
[1:22:04] well you know I use what's ever on sale
[1:22:07] uh you know but some people they use
[1:22:11] dial and some people use Dove and some
[1:22:14] people use Ivory you know what I mean
[1:22:17] and some use Liquid and some use that
[1:22:19] you know uh if you go into some showers
[1:22:23] it's like a garden in there they got
[1:22:25] cucumber this and carrot that and all
[1:22:28] kinds of different flavors of soap
[1:22:31] but what I'm saying is if if it was just
[1:22:36] as simple
[1:22:37] of choosing an inanimate object that
[1:22:41] didn't change
[1:22:43] but you've got to understand Satan
[1:22:45] didn't come that way he came in the
[1:22:48] spirit of deception
[1:22:54] so he's always changing his face
[1:22:59] to present
[1:23:02] that his Spirit to you
[1:23:07] in a way he keeps making it look more
[1:23:10] beautiful and more beautiful and more
[1:23:13] reasonable and more understanding
[1:23:16] because that what he's he's after he's
[1:23:20] after that he can rule over you
[1:23:23] that was his whole purpose he exalted
[1:23:27] himself above the stars of God that he
[1:23:30] might sit on the throne as if he is God
[1:23:32] and to rule over the Sons and Daughters
[1:23:36] of God
[1:23:39] so it's not a one-time
[1:23:41] proposition from Satan
[1:23:46] he's continually
[1:23:50] appearing
[1:23:52] as an angel of Light
[1:23:58] he don't stop
[1:24:01] he's like a roaring lion
[1:24:04] going about seeking whom he may devour
[1:24:10] so
[1:24:11] this opposing spirit because it is an
[1:24:15] opposing Spirit it is opposing you
[1:24:23] oh wouldn't it be simple if we could
[1:24:26] just say today I'm a Christian I accept
[1:24:28] Jesus Christ of my Lord and my savior
[1:24:31] I've made my choice
[1:24:36] wouldn't that be good but they're great
[1:24:38] writers
[1:24:40] call our forefathers two who have had
[1:24:45] the faith or the revelation of which
[1:24:49] that we are promised to once again
[1:24:52] obtain and have it restored us they
[1:24:57] looked at that and they said no church
[1:25:00] Satan will appear as an angel of Light
[1:25:08] he's not going to come as a devil
[1:25:12] remember we read that he said if he
[1:25:14] would have done that Eve would have
[1:25:17] never fell for it
[1:25:21] but the way that he works he keeps he he
[1:25:23] doesn't stop coming
[1:25:28] he doesn't he's still today this morning
[1:25:31] this afternoon tomorrow he's still going
[1:25:35] to present a choice
[1:25:38] that's why you'll hear me get on
[1:25:40] communion
[1:25:42] and try to encourage you to come to
[1:25:45] communion
[1:25:46] because after that's one of the
[1:25:49] ordinances that God requires of his
[1:25:52] church he doesn't require very many
[1:25:55] things
[1:25:58] as far as ordinances go
[1:26:02] but baptism
[1:26:04] communion in foot washing
[1:26:07] are the three physical ordinances
[1:26:11] that God requires of the believer
[1:26:16] Satan knows that
[1:26:19] ask me in the church why communion night
[1:26:23] is always the weakest night
[1:26:30] now you I don't know all your mind
[1:26:32] battles
[1:26:34] but I guarantee you at Communion times
[1:26:37] comes a lot of people are talked out of
[1:26:40] it not knowing what is transpiring
[1:26:48] Satan knows you've got to make a choice
[1:26:54] he knows you've got to say
[1:26:56] I gotta take communion
[1:26:59] it's an ordinance he says no I know if I
[1:27:02] I Bill I'm going to stop I'm going to do
[1:27:04] everything I can to stop them from doing
[1:27:06] it
[1:27:10] yeah I'll tell you
[1:27:13] he's good
[1:27:15] anything that can appear as an angel of
[1:27:18] Light
[1:27:19] is good
[1:27:21] good at what he does
[1:27:24] Satan is a good liar
[1:27:27] in fact I will give him credit
[1:27:29] for that he is a liar
[1:27:33] he's the father of all lies and there's
[1:27:36] no truth in them
[1:27:39] amen if you want to know what his
[1:27:42] placard is he's the president of lies
[1:27:45] he's the chief executive of Lies that's
[1:27:49] all he can do is lie he's a liar and
[1:27:53] there's no truth in him
[1:27:56] so you've got to understand every time
[1:27:58] that there comes an hour of decision he
[1:28:03] is there with a lie
[1:28:06] but it doesn't appear as a lie
[1:28:10] it appears as light
[1:28:14] it appears as understanding
[1:28:17] it appears as those things and like we
[1:28:21] we read before has God lost control or
[1:28:24] is he just permitting another agent to
[1:28:27] control I wonder the true answer to this
[1:28:31] question
[1:28:32] is to my opinion there are two opposing
[1:28:35] spirits in the world at work two
[1:28:38] opposing spirits in the world today at
[1:28:40] work
[1:28:41] now there can't be no more than two two
[1:28:45] heads one of them is the holy spirit at
[1:28:48] work the other one is the spirit of the
[1:28:51] devil and in the last days in
[1:28:56] deception
[1:28:59] so Satan's Spirit at work today is
[1:29:02] deception
[1:29:05] so it it isn't
[1:29:08] just a a real obvious
[1:29:13] choice
[1:29:16] it's a deception
[1:29:21] on the outside it looks like an angel
[1:29:26] on the outside it looks good because
[1:29:28] remember it's a mixed tree of what good
[1:29:31] and evil in other words it's like an
[1:29:35] Eminem
[1:29:38] you know what I mean it's you know in it
[1:29:42] coded on the outside you know I I they
[1:29:46] used to have a saying it melts in your
[1:29:48] mouth not in your hand
[1:29:50] well that's fine as long as you take it
[1:29:53] out of the package and put your mouth
[1:29:54] but I kept them in my hand for a long
[1:29:56] time and all of my hands turned was
[1:29:59] yellow and blue and every eye you know
[1:30:02] just a it's just a deception
[1:30:06] like the dish soap it was a deception
[1:30:10] so if it's poison
[1:30:13] wrapped in a candy shell wrapper
[1:30:17] of religion
[1:30:19] you know what I mean and it it on the
[1:30:23] outside it appears good
[1:30:27] you know what I mean it appears what's
[1:30:29] the word reasonable
[1:30:33] see if that's what Kayden does he tries
[1:30:36] to get us to lean to our own
[1:30:39] understanding
[1:30:41] where do we derive our understanding
[1:30:45] from we derive our understanding from
[1:30:48] the information that's fed to us through
[1:30:52] our five senses in our five inward
[1:30:54] feelings we take that information and we
[1:30:58] draw a conclusion from that information
[1:31:04] and that gives us our understanding
[1:31:10] and we say I understand it to believe
[1:31:13] this way or this is what I understand
[1:31:17] look you understand that's what he's the
[1:31:20] the master of
[1:31:22] presenting facts to you to drawing a
[1:31:26] picture to you to making a a a
[1:31:31] an offer to you
[1:31:34] that looks good
[1:31:36] it looks religious it looks spiritual it
[1:31:41] looks like it's the right thing
[1:31:44] but down underneath it it's not the word
[1:31:51] like our brother said this morning it
[1:31:53] was a great emotional outpouring
[1:31:57] of worshiping
[1:32:01] look if you if you've seen the word and
[1:32:04] you understand the word I've I've
[1:32:07] watched Services of pagans
[1:32:11] where they worship
[1:32:13] and pretty soon they're jumping this
[1:32:15] high off of the ground
[1:32:18] they're almost in a trance
[1:32:22] they get caught up in the spirit
[1:32:25] that anointing falls on the just and the
[1:32:28] unjust
[1:32:29] it's the same reign as our brothers so
[1:32:32] beautifully Express if it falls on the
[1:32:35] just in the end just when the rain falls
[1:32:37] on the kuckleber the kuckleberry goes
[1:32:39] praise God and worships and thanks God
[1:32:42] for the rain because God will pour the
[1:32:45] rain out on everybody
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] nobody's going to go up there and say
[1:32:52] Lord
[1:32:54] we didn't get the rain
[1:32:56] they're going to go up there and say
[1:32:58] Lord we did this and we did that and we
[1:33:01] did this and we did that and he's going
[1:33:03] to say depart from me you doers of
[1:33:06] iniquity because I never knew you
[1:33:13] that's a kind of deception
[1:33:16] that we're dealing with
[1:33:20] oh I I don't want you to get numb
[1:33:26] and come under spiritual amnesia
[1:33:32] and be anemic
[1:33:36] which are all descriptions
[1:33:39] that the prophet of God is for the
[1:33:41] church
[1:33:44] I don't want you to become lukewarm I
[1:33:46] don't want to become lukewarm
[1:33:49] God I don't want to sit back and think
[1:33:52] that this is over
[1:33:56] that's getting to be our attitude
[1:33:58] sometimes within the framework of the
[1:34:00] message we're the elect it's over
[1:34:04] you better not fall for that one second
[1:34:06] church I'm not responsible for the other
[1:34:09] churches
[1:34:11] I am responsible for what I say to this
[1:34:13] congregation Satan is still deceiving
[1:34:17] and he'll deceive the very elective it's
[1:34:20] possible
[1:34:26] and you can take the permissive will of
[1:34:28] God
[1:34:31] which you'll pay for
[1:34:34] and he'll bring you back around
[1:34:37] but I want to mature past that don't you
[1:34:42] I want to come to work that I'm built up
[1:34:45] in the Statue of a perfect man that I'm
[1:34:48] I'm able to have strong meat I'm able to
[1:34:51] look at this life situations and the
[1:34:54] decisions that are set before me uh
[1:34:56] through the word of God
[1:35:02] because it is chaos now
[1:35:08] he tries to offer you so many choices so
[1:35:11] many opinion options so many sides to
[1:35:15] take
[1:35:16] we got one side to take
[1:35:18] we take sides with Jesus
[1:35:21] we take sides with his word I don't care
[1:35:24] about the social injustice in Alabama
[1:35:27] the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:35:29] just the good for everybody that lives
[1:35:31] in Alabama as everybody that lives in
[1:35:34] Montana
[1:35:35] that's why I tell you all the time I
[1:35:38] know somebody told me one time they said
[1:35:40] well you don't know very much about
[1:35:41] Congolese I know more about Congolese
[1:35:44] than most Congolese know
[1:35:49] they were born in sin shaped into
[1:35:52] iniquity and came into the world
[1:35:55] speaking lies
[1:35:58] that's right
[1:36:00] and Jesus Christ is the way the truth
[1:36:03] the life and no man comes unto the
[1:36:06] father but by him
[1:36:08] and the story
[1:36:13] no culture gives any man the right not
[1:36:17] to follow the word of God
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:23] and I've seen people from all Races all
[1:36:27] cultures all background come into
[1:36:29] subjections in this message and we have
[1:36:32] the same Spirit the same mind the same
[1:36:35] actions the same life the same power the
[1:36:39] same result the same Grace the same
[1:36:42] Mercy the same healings The Same Spirit
[1:36:46] for by one Spirit we are baptized into
[1:36:50] one body
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:36:55] that's just a big old lying Spirit of
[1:36:59] reasoning
[1:37:02] guys Jimmy we have our ways of doing
[1:37:04] things I said yeah and they're wrong
[1:37:07] take your way
[1:37:10] lean to your own understanding
[1:37:16] what he got Satan got him to do
[1:37:19] what he's trying to do today lean to
[1:37:21] your own understanding
[1:37:23] the scripture tells us Lee not to your
[1:37:27] own understanding away seemeth right
[1:37:30] unto a man but the end of that way is
[1:37:33] death
[1:37:36] remember what I'm trying to say this
[1:37:37] morning the choosing isn't over
[1:37:43] he's coming every day
[1:37:46] and that battle goes on in your mind
[1:37:51] God says his word Satan comes with his
[1:37:54] knowledge to disprove it his education
[1:37:57] to disprove it he comes with everything
[1:38:04] I've seen people with water baptism
[1:38:07] how are you been baptized well I was
[1:38:09] baptize the name of the father son Holy
[1:38:10] Ghost well let me show you in the Bible
[1:38:11] That's not
[1:38:13] that's not right
[1:38:15] and when now they have to choose
[1:38:18] whether they're going to be re-baptized
[1:38:20] or not
[1:38:22] oh here it comes my heart was right
[1:38:26] when I got baptized this way
[1:38:29] I had given my life to Christ and he
[1:38:33] came into me
[1:38:37] so what do you do
[1:38:39] you go over to the scripture and says
[1:38:41] these are believers they gave their life
[1:38:43] to Christ and Paul come and asked him he
[1:38:45] said have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:38:48] next question was how were you baptized
[1:38:50] what was Paul doing Paul was going back
[1:38:53] to the formula
[1:38:55] because God doesn't change there's no
[1:38:58] reasoning with God you don't have an
[1:39:01] understanding when it comes to God
[1:39:03] there's only two things you can do with
[1:39:06] God is obey it or disobey
[1:39:10] right so there's only two children
[1:39:15] the children of obedience and the
[1:39:17] children of disobedience
[1:39:20] you can only be one or the other either
[1:39:22] you're disobeying God's word or you're
[1:39:25] obeying what God's word
[1:39:28] what is lukewarm
[1:39:31] it's the mixture
[1:39:35] of hot and cold
[1:39:38] he said I would either you be hot or
[1:39:40] cold but if you're lukewarm I'll spill
[1:39:43] the out of my mouth he says no man can
[1:39:46] serve two masters
[1:39:49] you can't serve Disobedience and serve
[1:39:53] obedience at the same time
[1:39:58] can't do it
[1:40:00] you've got to choose
[1:40:04] these two opposing spirits
[1:40:08] are forcing
[1:40:10] a choice
[1:40:16] they'll be forced to take the mark of
[1:40:18] the beast
[1:40:24] you can't you you can't live in the
[1:40:26] middle
[1:40:28] the middle is disappearing
[1:40:34] the world is pulling away from you elect
[1:40:37] lady
[1:40:38] the world is heading up
[1:40:42] into a great Council of churches
[1:40:46] the world is heading up into a one-world
[1:40:49] government
[1:40:51] with the Antichrist spirit
[1:40:54] what does Antichrist mean
[1:40:57] anti-anointed word not anti-bible
[1:41:01] not anti-scriptures
[1:41:04] anti-anointed word Christ means
[1:41:07] anointing the anointed word for the hour
[1:41:12] let me just finish reading this
[1:41:16] too great opposing spirits the two
[1:41:19] Spirits one of them's God's holy spirit
[1:41:22] the other one is the devil Spirit
[1:41:24] working in deception the people of Earth
[1:41:28] are now making their choice so if if it
[1:41:34] wasn't an option
[1:41:39] you you don't have the option
[1:41:43] of whether you make a choice or not
[1:41:48] no choice is is the wrong choice
[1:41:53] no choice is a choice in itself
[1:41:58] that's right
[1:42:00] it's that simple
[1:42:03] if we don't catch what's going on
[1:42:07] if you don't see the God of this evil
[1:42:09] age
[1:42:10] heading up
[1:42:12] throwing everything he's got at you to
[1:42:16] deceive you everything he gets at you to
[1:42:19] get you off of The Exodus course
[1:42:25] everything he's got to get your mind
[1:42:28] some other place than stayed on him look
[1:42:33] up
[1:42:34] for your Redemption draws nigh and he
[1:42:38] can get your eyes out of the heavens and
[1:42:41] on this Earth he's trying to do that by
[1:42:44] offering you everything he's got out
[1:42:47] there
[1:42:48] everything you can to reason with
[1:42:51] everything you can do use your own
[1:42:54] understanding
[1:42:56] everything he can to disprove the word
[1:42:59] of God you say that's not true Peter was
[1:43:01] fighting it
[1:43:03] in his day where is the signs of his
[1:43:06] coming
[1:43:07] all things remain the same
[1:43:11] and you know Peter's response
[1:43:14] the days coming this place is going to
[1:43:16] burn up
[1:43:18] but let's just read a few statements and
[1:43:21] we'll close to this morning
[1:43:23] because my point is the people of the
[1:43:26] Earth are now making their choice
[1:43:30] you this morning
[1:43:32] you are making a choice
[1:43:36] he says the spirit of God
[1:43:39] is growed up into the full statue of God
[1:43:43] in the age that we're now living
[1:43:46] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[1:43:51] message of the hour
[1:43:52] the holy spirit is doing this so that
[1:43:56] the people that believe God will be
[1:43:59] called out of this chaos
[1:44:09] so we see we've got two groups of people
[1:44:12] the children of obedience and the
[1:44:15] children
[1:44:16] of Disobedience right now listen what he
[1:44:20] says this is in the God of this evil age
[1:44:23] because what prophet of God's teaching
[1:44:25] he's showing us what the God of this
[1:44:28] evil age has presented to the people to
[1:44:33] choose
[1:44:34] he's given them religion
[1:44:38] in any taste they want it
[1:44:42] Baptist taste Methodist taste would you
[1:44:45] like to have a method of smoke would you
[1:44:47] like to have Methodist cancer
[1:44:50] or would you like to have Menthol cancer
[1:44:53] would you like to have Holy Ghost
[1:44:56] UPC cancer
[1:45:00] Assembly of God cancer
[1:45:03] what spiritual cancer do you want
[1:45:07] what denominational
[1:45:09] spiritual cancer flavor do you want
[1:45:14] oh I'll take this flavor God's so good
[1:45:21] he would never judge this person
[1:45:24] no he's not
[1:45:27] he's not going to judge anybody Jesus
[1:45:30] isn't going to judge anybody he said
[1:45:32] I'll not judge the world my word will
[1:45:36] judge
[1:45:39] what is the Judgment did you choose to
[1:45:42] be obedient to the word or did you
[1:45:45] choose Satan's reasoning or did you lean
[1:45:48] to your own understanding did you come
[1:45:51] up with your own moral code your own
[1:45:54] moral choice your own righteousness
[1:45:58] and that's what you take
[1:46:01] it's a choice
[1:46:04] and that's what he said he said this is
[1:46:07] choosing day
[1:46:14] either live for today or die choose God
[1:46:19] and live
[1:46:20] and God is the word and the word is
[1:46:25] and the word is the word manifested for
[1:46:29] the hour and the day
[1:46:33] oh I'm just going to choose Paul's
[1:46:36] gospel
[1:46:37] it's not the choice
[1:46:42] the choice isn't this Bible
[1:46:46] this Choice isn't man's interpretation
[1:46:49] of the Bible
[1:46:51] that's not the choice the choice is in
[1:46:54] Jesus Christ 2 000 years ago at Calvary
[1:46:57] that's not the choice that God's offered
[1:47:03] God's offered them one choice to believe
[1:47:07] the Vindicated word of God
[1:47:11] when the same pillar fire and the same
[1:47:14] Cloud appeared proving that they're
[1:47:17] leading a children in an exodus
[1:47:23] or a great big porridge pot
[1:47:28] with all kinds of flavors
[1:47:31] thrown in
[1:47:33] it isn't a choice
[1:47:37] our choice
[1:47:39] he gave this what to choose
[1:47:43] God provided
[1:47:46] away he provided his choice
[1:47:51] which is his Vindicated word for the
[1:47:54] hour
[1:47:56] God presented his message
[1:48:00] to the children of this Exodus
[1:48:05] the ones that he called he did he called
[1:48:08] we think oh I'm called diverted he's
[1:48:10] called you to make the choice
[1:48:13] that's what your calling is he called
[1:48:16] you and gave you and put you in a
[1:48:18] position
[1:48:19] and said you got to choose the word we
[1:48:22] go and bypass the fruits of it we claim
[1:48:26] to be elected
[1:48:31] and then live contrary to the word
[1:48:41] or I could give a Litany of things
[1:48:44] that are done that's contrary to the
[1:48:47] word
[1:48:48] you understand what's happening
[1:48:51] is Satan is branding
[1:48:56] his children
[1:48:58] you know how you brand the cattle
[1:49:01] to show that this is
[1:49:04] my cattle
[1:49:06] they they take a uh like it might be
[1:49:09] called 3K Ranch
[1:49:12] so they'll have three K's all in a row I
[1:49:16] probably shouldn't have said KKK right
[1:49:18] I'm sure somebody's going to
[1:49:19] misinterpret that and and and
[1:49:22] this this message won't be able to go on
[1:49:25] YouTube so
[1:49:28] you better hear it well it's here
[1:49:34] so it's triple V Ranch
[1:49:38] and they they brand that cattle
[1:49:44] they they say this is my cloud
[1:49:49] well Satan is branding
[1:49:52] hidden too
[1:49:54] you sisters I talk to you about these
[1:49:57] tight dresses
[1:50:01] they're the brand of Satan
[1:50:04] it don't matter if you walk into this
[1:50:07] shirt can you look at that like say
[1:50:09] that's the Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:50:11] that's the cloud that appeared at the
[1:50:13] Seven Seals that's the pillar of fire it
[1:50:16] don't care you're wearing his brand
[1:50:21] he's got his mark on you
[1:50:24] high heels
[1:50:27] I can preach at high heels I got so
[1:50:29] frustrated the other day I was gonna go
[1:50:30] get some shoes
[1:50:34] and put them in the foyer with the big
[1:50:37] sign says these are high heels
[1:50:41] now I would prefer
[1:50:44] that you pray about it and the Holy
[1:50:47] Spirit would convict you
[1:50:50] and you would get rid of them not by the
[1:50:52] law but by grace
[1:50:57] but sometimes the law has got to be
[1:51:00] applied in order for there to be an
[1:51:03] understanding of sin
[1:51:08] that's what the law was for
[1:51:12] you can't kill you can't steal you can't
[1:51:16] commit adultery you can't lust after
[1:51:18] their husband's wife I mean you can say
[1:51:21] it
[1:51:23] and I can preach it
[1:51:28] but this has ought to be the last place
[1:51:31] tight dresses and high heels come from
[1:51:33] you sisters
[1:51:37] you mothers
[1:51:39] the Bible tells you to teach the younger
[1:51:43] children
[1:51:49] I'm just going to start going up and
[1:51:51] saying TT
[1:51:53] too tight
[1:51:57] you see me look after over at you and go
[1:52:02] that's TT
[1:52:09] h
[1:52:12] too high
[1:52:13] if you look at me and I look at you and
[1:52:16] I go
[1:52:18] that means they're too high
[1:52:23] you know how particular the prophet of
[1:52:26] God was when they were building his
[1:52:28] house if they brought a radio on there
[1:52:31] he said turn that stuff off or get off
[1:52:36] the job
[1:52:38] now I'm sure he didn't say it like that
[1:52:42] I'm sure he walked up in the presence of
[1:52:44] God they are immediately under
[1:52:46] conviction and he probably just looked
[1:52:48] at him so sweet and said would you mind
[1:52:51] turning that
[1:52:53] music off and they ran to that dial as
[1:52:57] quick as they could and grab that thing
[1:52:58] and threw it in their truck because
[1:53:00] whatever he was packing they didn't want
[1:53:02] to mess with
[1:53:08] no but why play Church
[1:53:14] you
[1:53:16] let the Elder sisters teach the younger
[1:53:20] is that Timothy
[1:53:24] we follow the Bible here right within
[1:53:27] our object the revealed word of God for
[1:53:29] the hour start taking care of it
[1:53:32] you young sisters talk to one another
[1:53:38] don't let these things creep in
[1:53:43] I pulled up the other day to a stop sign
[1:53:45] and there was a a lady next to me and
[1:53:48] you know and I looking over the light
[1:53:50] and I caught her I thought she was
[1:53:52] trying to poke something in her mind
[1:53:54] and I I didn't know if I should jump up
[1:53:57] and help her and then pretty soon I
[1:53:58] realized she had this stick and she was
[1:54:01] going
[1:54:08] and then she
[1:54:12] I thought what are you doing
[1:54:16] foreign
[1:54:17] I just wish I was behind her
[1:54:20] I wanted to Hawk my hornet
[1:54:24] I mean it's crazy
[1:54:28] what is that a sign of it's a sign of
[1:54:31] Jezebel do you understand that lady
[1:54:34] unspin knowing to herself
[1:54:38] she's paying her face like Jezebel
[1:54:42] she's doing the best she can to present
[1:54:44] herself to somebody
[1:54:47] as beautiful
[1:54:49] the beauty of a Christian woman is her
[1:54:51] character
[1:54:58] I know that's ABC's but the God of this
[1:55:01] evil age is one of the basic ABC books
[1:55:04] you'll ever read
[1:55:06] and I recommend it so we understand that
[1:55:09] this is definitely choosing time
[1:55:12] that that it's it's come down to the
[1:55:15] time
[1:55:16] that
[1:55:18] that the proof
[1:55:21] of the seed is the choice that it makes
[1:55:26] and I thought you know how when the
[1:55:28] prophet of God preaches there's all
[1:55:30] these things he says
[1:55:32] that you can't believe he was saying
[1:55:34] them in the 50s what's he trying to tell
[1:55:37] us he wants us to know recognizing the
[1:55:41] day and its message
[1:55:43] you've got to recognize we've got to all
[1:55:46] of us have got to recognize
[1:55:50] what's going on and where we're at and
[1:55:55] what it is that God's watching us
[1:55:59] he's watching what are you doing
[1:56:02] what are you choosing what are you
[1:56:04] accepting
[1:56:08] Satan is always trying to deceive you
[1:56:13] he's always trying to trick you
[1:56:16] he's always trying to get you to receive
[1:56:19] him and take his knowledge take his
[1:56:22] wisdom he doesn't stop day in and day
[1:56:25] out he's after you he's trying to get
[1:56:27] you whether it's with some sweet talking
[1:56:30] lover boy or whether it's with job
[1:56:32] whether it's with a card doesn't matter
[1:56:34] what it is
[1:56:38] he is everywhere
[1:56:43] and we've got to be
[1:56:46] understand
[1:56:48] that we've got to get branded too
[1:56:51] our brand is the word of God our brand
[1:56:54] is the amen the word of God this is what
[1:56:57] God's looking for he's looking for a
[1:57:00] people
[1:57:01] that chooses word that's why Paul told
[1:57:04] Timothy study to show yourself approved
[1:57:08] that you might instruct
[1:57:15] I wish it wasn't the way it is
[1:57:19] I wish I could preach something else I
[1:57:21] could reach I could preach about the
[1:57:23] power of God and everybody being slayed
[1:57:26] in the spirit and and and great works
[1:57:30] being done which I believe will do those
[1:57:33] things if the Lord permit but let us
[1:57:35] move on to perfection
[1:57:43] and I believe that what's going to give
[1:57:45] the believer
[1:57:47] its power
[1:57:50] is its ability to make a conscious
[1:57:54] choice for the word
[1:57:58] the recognizing of the two spirits in
[1:58:01] the framework of the church
[1:58:04] with standing the one
[1:58:08] and the choosing of the other
[1:58:11] is what makes them an invincible Army
[1:58:16] where they can walk up and know they've
[1:58:19] chosen the word of God without any
[1:58:21] emotion because there's something inside
[1:58:25] of them that said this word is true
[1:58:29] amen
[1:58:31] not part of it
[1:58:33] not the part you like
[1:58:36] but all of it
[1:58:39] all of it every bit of it
[1:58:43] and not looking back
[1:58:45] leaving those things which are behind
[1:58:48] behind pressing for a higher calling
[1:58:51] every person in this building this
[1:58:54] morning has the right to put their sins
[1:58:56] under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:59] not look back again and start pressing
[1:59:02] for a higher calling to obey God's word
[1:59:09] you can't drive looking back
[1:59:13] but you can drive going forward
[1:59:17] that's what he said he says it's
[1:59:19] choosing time
[1:59:22] and then I'll this is beautiful and I'll
[1:59:24] read this in closing brother Mike if you
[1:59:27] want to put it up on the board it starts
[1:59:30] in
[1:59:32] a paragraph
[1:59:34] 158.
[1:59:39] so we we've been we've been watching

[2:00:51] you could ask it what's playing at
[2:00:53] Cinema Mark 21
[2:00:56] now if she told the truth she'd say you
[2:00:58] don't want to go there there's nothing
[2:01:00] but a bunch of devil spirits that are
[2:01:02] going to possess your thinking
[2:01:06] let me be Google for a day
[2:01:12] what's this other lady's name Lexus
[2:01:16] that's the biggest gospel in the world
[2:01:18] you say something she listens and she
[2:01:20] passes it right on
[2:01:25] is it ever Dawn on you
[2:01:28] that that is a deception of Satan
[2:01:36] civilization is of the devil
[2:01:49] Prophet God said I'm going to get a lot
[2:01:51] of letters on that
[2:01:55] it's of the devil
[2:01:57] it's all meant to influence your choice
[2:02:01] it all meant to provide you reasoning
[2:02:04] and other ways of thinking and to try to
[2:02:08] draw conclusions the whole thing of
[2:02:11] Satan is to get you to lean to your own
[2:02:15] understanding
[2:02:19] the prophet God said they don't need
[2:02:22] faith
[2:02:23] because they have knowledge
[2:02:29] they make their choices based on
[2:02:31] knowledge
[2:02:32] not based on conviction not based on
[2:02:35] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:38] they make a way for themselves
[2:02:41] he provides it in any flavor you want
[2:02:47] and you're the cult
[2:02:49] you're the man follower
[2:02:52] you're the one that don't believe in
[2:02:55] Jesus you're the one that don't follow
[2:02:57] the Bible because you recognize the
[2:03:01] Vindicated fulfillment of Malachi 4 5
[2:03:04] Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7 you
[2:03:08] recognize Jesus Christ in this
[2:03:11] generation when he was veiled in flesh
[2:03:16] and you said that's the Lord
[2:03:19] hidden a man
[2:03:22] bringing us the true word of God to get
[2:03:26] us out of this chaos
[2:03:32] and that's a reproach
[2:03:34] we're going to have to bear
[2:03:37] our choice will bring reproach
[2:03:41] our choice will bring criticism
[2:03:49] if you don't think the world he doesn't
[2:03:53] try to bring you in fear people say you
[2:03:55] better be careful of what you say
[2:04:00] wait a minute my Bible said be careful
[2:04:02] for nothing
[2:04:05] you can't preach against homosexuality
[2:04:07] homosexuality is of the devil
[2:04:11] Lexus
[2:04:13] homosexuality is of the devil YouTube
[2:04:17] homosexuality is of the devil
[2:04:21] Romans tells us that it's the product of
[2:04:25] a reprobate mind not wishing to retain
[2:04:28] God in their knowledge
[2:04:33] working that which which is unseemingly
[2:04:36] man with man woman with women doing that
[2:04:40] which is not natural
[2:04:44] now let me
[2:04:45] play the other part of that Lexus
[2:04:48] it is a spirit that can be cast off
[2:04:56] let me pay the other part of that Google
[2:04:59] it is a demon that can be cast out
[2:05:11] let me say how Paul summed it up I'm not
[2:05:14] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:05:17] because it's the power of God unto
[2:05:20] salvation
[2:05:20] [Applause]
[2:05:28] you got to choose
[2:05:32] he said if it seems evil to you now
[2:05:35] think of that
[2:05:39] think of that from I want the spirit I
[2:05:42] want if the Holy Spirit would help us
[2:05:45] he said if you think it's evil to serve
[2:05:49] the god
[2:05:54] and today people think it's evil that
[2:05:58] I'd preach the gospel in its fullness
[2:06:05] it's evil
[2:06:09] the Bible says come out from amongst
[2:06:11] them and be separate
[2:06:13] and what's their word
[2:06:15] inclusion
[2:06:19] include everybody
[2:06:21] oh you've got to let you've got to let
[2:06:23] them come and sit in your church
[2:06:29] no I don't
[2:06:32] I've asked a lot of people
[2:06:35] to leave the church
[2:06:39] repent or leave
[2:06:43] I didn't do it the way Peter did it
[2:06:49] you liar
[2:06:51] why do you try to deceive the Holy
[2:06:54] Spirit
[2:06:56] take this person out and bury him
[2:07:01] oh did you know the prophet God said the
[2:07:04] days of ananias and Sapphire we come to
[2:07:06] the church again
[2:07:10] they think it's evil
[2:07:12] they think by making a stand for the
[2:07:14] gospel you're evil and people are now
[2:07:17] looking at it they're listening to all
[2:07:19] Satan's reasoning all his lovey-dovey
[2:07:22] lies all his flavors he's got to offer
[2:07:25] all his religious Kingdom providing a
[2:07:28] better way to worship and a better way
[2:07:30] to do this and so sweet and skilled and
[2:07:34] knowledge and and just so tempered it
[2:07:36] won't hurt anybody's feelings and full
[2:07:39] of psychology and all that stuff which
[2:07:41] the end thereof is hell
[2:07:49] and and
[2:07:52] Satan's made it evil
[2:07:55] so that's what he said if you think it's
[2:07:57] evil
[2:07:59] to follow this message
[2:08:01] go back
[2:08:03] to the God of this evil age
[2:08:06] he will receive you with open arms
[2:08:12] but if you don't want to serve him
[2:08:14] and you want to serve the Living God
[2:08:16] Come As You Are
[2:08:19] he'll receive you in whatever state
[2:08:21] you're in whatever sins you have
[2:08:24] whatever mistakes you made he'll receive
[2:08:27] you come unto me all ye that are heavy
[2:08:30] laden and I'll give you rest
[2:08:35] he's here here to do for us exceedingly
[2:08:38] and abundantly above whatever we could
[2:08:41] even ask or think or choose
[2:08:45] but choose ye this day
[2:08:48] whom you're going to serve you've got to
[2:08:51] choose you can't remain lukewarm you've
[2:08:54] got it's come to the time you've got to
[2:08:57] sell out to this message of the hour a
[2:09:00] hundred percent
[2:09:02] you can't keep listening to the deceptor
[2:09:08] and reasoning with them
[2:09:12] he'll just change the LIE
[2:09:15] [Music]
[2:09:18] he'll just change the deception
[2:09:21] he'll keep changing and changing and
[2:09:24] changing till you perceive him as an
[2:09:27] angel of Light
[2:09:31] and then you call that truth
[2:09:36] and that's an Abomination to God
[2:09:43] and that's what he's doing
[2:09:48] and we're not taking it serious
[2:09:55] and that's what he said worship God in
[2:09:58] sincerity
[2:10:00] and in truth
[2:10:02] amen what did
[2:10:04] Joshua
[2:10:06] speak these words at that Exodus
[2:10:11] because Satan didn't change and God
[2:10:14] didn't change
[2:10:16] and we're in an exodus and Satan is
[2:10:20] doing the same exact thing and the word
[2:10:22] of God's the same to us choose this day
[2:10:27] whom you will serve and I was going to
[2:10:30] read this now notice Christ's bride 158
[2:10:34] is heading up also
[2:10:36] we see where the Antichrist
[2:10:40] is heading
[2:10:42] paragraph 158 God of this evil age
[2:10:46] where the Antichrist is heading bringing
[2:10:49] back there and now coming to a head the
[2:10:53] echamental council will put it to an
[2:10:57] ecclesiastic head
[2:10:59] and and you know what he said that
[2:11:01] religious and political world will join
[2:11:04] us on
[2:11:05] he said
[2:11:07] and the little church
[2:11:09] that's come along also Christ's word
[2:11:13] bride down Through the Ages is coming to
[2:11:16] a head
[2:11:18] because she's going to be United back to
[2:11:22] its mate
[2:11:24] always just like the church and
[2:11:27] everything else it's got to unite
[2:11:31] it's got to unite
[2:11:34] the middle ground
[2:11:37] is coming to an end
[2:11:39] lukewarmness
[2:11:41] is coming to the end
[2:11:44] they're Satan marks his
[2:11:47] Church
[2:11:48] and Satan marks his church
[2:11:52] is coming
[2:11:54] to an end the wheat everything else has
[2:11:57] come right back
[2:12:09] right back to its head where it started
[2:12:12] from like Cain and Abel
[2:12:15] word bride heading up in the person of
[2:12:19] the word of God made manifest in this
[2:12:23] evil age
[2:12:25] that we're living in
[2:12:27] see where it's heading up
[2:12:32] you see your Choi
[2:12:33] I want to go with the head up of the
[2:12:35] Bride
[2:12:36] and Satan will soon take his
[2:12:39] intellectual bride and exalt his great
[2:12:42] one which is the Antichrist the
[2:12:45] hierarchy
[2:12:47] and set him upon a throne and the whole
[2:12:51] world will wander after him
[2:12:54] and then Christ will come
[2:12:56] the two cannot exist in the same time
[2:13:00] and his kingdom will be taken and he'll
[2:13:03] be destroyed Hallelujah
[2:13:06] I like that part I want to read that
[2:13:09] again
[2:13:11] amen amen
[2:13:14] hey
[2:13:16] amen yeah and he'll be taken and he'll
[2:13:20] be destroyed
[2:13:26] yep the two can exist at the same time
[2:13:29] his kingdom will be taken and he'll be
[2:13:31] destroyed
[2:13:32] and Christ the word of God
[2:13:35] which the woman is part of the man's
[2:13:38] body
[2:13:39] they're not to they're one and the bride
[2:13:43] Church word a people called out from
[2:13:48] here and there for his namesake will
[2:13:52] unite into the body of Jesus Christ
[2:13:57] you understand what we're doing we're
[2:14:00] uniting into that body of Jesus Christ
[2:14:03] you've got to choose what body
[2:14:07] am I going to be a part of
[2:14:12] May I drop this in that's why
[2:14:16] the token is given as a house cleaner
[2:14:23] go start applying the token
[2:14:28] if they don't
[2:14:30] get their tokens approval
[2:14:33] throw it out
[2:14:34] and the kingdom of the Antichrist will
[2:14:37] be taken and destroyed and Christ shall
[2:14:40] take the throne and set upon the throne
[2:14:42] of his father David and Reign upon the
[2:14:45] earth a thousand years then the present
[2:14:49] then the present the Church of God
[2:14:53] without spot or blemish
[2:14:56] now notice her long hair Nazarite vow to
[2:14:59] the word
[2:15:00] it'll it'll picture the bride of Christ
[2:15:04] now
[2:15:05] we picture the Antichrist where is she
[2:15:08] religious in everything sincere
[2:15:13] now the humble little bride of Christ
[2:15:15] just simply believes the word
[2:15:19] whosoever she is it's individual
[2:15:24] by hope and trust
[2:15:26] that these many
[2:15:28] setting present
[2:15:30] many listening in and I hope that myself
[2:15:33] and every one of you all are part of
[2:15:37] that bride
[2:15:39] I hope many
[2:15:40] and it will be all that's been ordained
[2:15:45] to that will be that because it's their
[2:15:50] nature
[2:15:51] they see the word can only recognize the
[2:15:55] word
[2:15:56] it cannot recognize a denomination or a
[2:16:00] perversion it knows better
[2:16:02] it's the word it can't recognize nothing
[2:16:07] what is sin or iniquity to know better
[2:16:13] and not to do it
[2:16:17] and I believe this is a call
[2:16:23] to many of us
[2:16:26] to quit being lukewarm
[2:16:30] her long hair Nazarite vow shows that
[2:16:33] she is vowed to God
[2:16:35] her beautiful gown
[2:16:37] of his promised word for that age she is
[2:16:41] living in wrapped around her
[2:16:45] vindicating her with him of Hebrews 13 8
[2:16:51] Jesus the same yesterday today and
[2:16:54] forever as she is a part of the word
[2:16:56] groom true to him in every point
[2:17:01] you see how he's marking his bride you
[2:17:04] see how Satan's marking this right
[2:17:08] and
[2:17:10] I'll just read it
[2:17:12] um
[2:17:13] in
[2:17:15] I'm going to read this because prophet
[2:17:17] of God said it and I don't need to make
[2:17:19] a lot of explanations you know he
[2:17:22] preached marriage and divorce we know
[2:17:24] there's forgiveness for sins we know
[2:17:26] marriages can be restored but this is
[2:17:30] what he says he says now look if a woman
[2:17:34] goes out here and is married to a man
[2:17:37] and she goes out and makes love with
[2:17:40] another man and has an affair with him
[2:17:43] and comes back to her husband
[2:17:46] he should kick her out
[2:17:48] is that right she must be true to him
[2:17:51] because she's vowed to him
[2:17:54] and the and the bride of Christ is vowed
[2:17:57] to Christ and he is the word
[2:18:01] not even wink at the other side a woman
[2:18:06] should not even wink at another man she
[2:18:10] should make no signs no emotions at all
[2:18:13] towards him for she is absolutely a
[2:18:17] bride to the one bridegroom
[2:18:20] see that's what happens when you get out
[2:18:24] of Christ
[2:18:25] you start winking at the world
[2:18:28] you start showing emotion to the world
[2:18:31] now we're sinners
[2:18:33] but we're saved by grace
[2:18:36] so I if you've been guilty of those
[2:18:38] things we're not throwing you out
[2:18:42] just like Jesus said in the beginning it
[2:18:44] wasn't so
[2:18:46] but we're Gentiles we came out of
[2:18:48] Gentile backgrounds many people were in
[2:18:51] church and in religion even following
[2:18:54] this message without the baptism of the
[2:18:57] Holy Spirit
[2:18:59] therefore they had nothing to keep them
[2:19:01] from following the flesh because
[2:19:04] intellectual knowledge will not keep you
[2:19:07] but if you let the spirit of God come
[2:19:10] into your heart the scripture says he
[2:19:12] cleanses you from all unrighteousness
[2:19:15] and we become new creatures in Christ
[2:19:18] Jesus Justified as we've never did it in
[2:19:22] the first place so don't leave that part
[2:19:26] out
[2:19:28] he said yeah
[2:19:30] she is absolutely a bride to one groom
[2:19:33] we don't want
[2:19:35] we don't want none of your mixed tree
[2:19:38] your denominations
[2:19:41] but true to Christ the word
[2:19:44] he'll vindicate it to be true no sir not
[2:19:48] even an emotion of anything towards
[2:19:51] making love to him not join his ranks or
[2:19:55] nothing else or let him get in you
[2:20:00] let him get you in his arms or in his
[2:20:04] care
[2:20:07] or talk to you
[2:20:09] over this way or that way
[2:20:14] don't even get in his care
[2:20:19] your job's not what's taking care of you
[2:20:25] your bank accounts not what's taking
[2:20:27] care of you
[2:20:31] if God don't watch the city
[2:20:33] The Watchman watches in vain
[2:20:37] you listen only to One Voice
[2:20:40] my sheep know my voice
[2:20:43] a stranger they will not
[2:20:46] what is his voice
[2:20:48] any man's voice
[2:20:51] is his word
[2:20:53] and that
[2:20:55] and this is it the Bible not one word to
[2:21:00] be added to it or taken from it
[2:21:03] just stay right with that voice a
[2:21:07] stranger they will not follow
[2:21:11] a denomination as she is part of the
[2:21:14] groom true to him in every point
[2:21:18] waiting the wedding
[2:21:20] United not at the economical Council but
[2:21:24] in the sky at the wedding supper
[2:21:27] she has been given this is for our own
[2:21:31] church
[2:21:32] she has been given and revealed to her
[2:21:36] the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible
[2:21:44] that's your wedding band
[2:21:47] that was your engagement
[2:21:52] isn't that beautiful
[2:21:55] she has been given and revealed to her
[2:21:58] the seven sealed Mysteries of the Bible
[2:22:02] she sees the folly of the deceiver
[2:22:07] so very close to the truth that almost
[2:22:11] deceived the elect
[2:22:13] she sees it
[2:22:16] see the two opposing Spirits at work in
[2:22:19] this evil age
[2:22:21] can you see it
[2:22:23] each very religious Cain and Abel
[2:22:27] Spirits again coming to their heads
[2:22:30] still the same as they started one
[2:22:34] worship by Beauty and by knowledge and
[2:22:37] by education and by science and by
[2:22:41] ethics
[2:22:42] and the other one by faith
[2:22:45] of the revelation of the word of God
[2:22:48] both of them standing right in this
[2:22:52] building this morning
[2:22:55] that's right
[2:22:56] Revelation or faith in his word makes no
[2:23:01] claims of the knowledge the real true
[2:23:07] Christian
[2:23:10] how many wants to be a real true
[2:23:12] Christian
[2:23:16] it's choosing time
[2:23:18] and I I
[2:23:20] hope I said that this morning with no
[2:23:25] condemnation in my heart
[2:23:27] towards anybody
[2:23:29] because I can say like Paul as the
[2:23:31] chiefest of sinners
[2:23:33] and there is no sin that is not covered
[2:23:38] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:23:40] but he also said go and sin no more
[2:23:45] [Music]
[2:23:46] and leave those things which are behind
[2:23:49] behind impress
[2:23:51] for a higher calling
[2:23:54] but let's don't
[2:23:56] fool ourselves that we're not in a
[2:23:58] battle it's individual
[2:24:01] if you have a problem
[2:24:03] maybe it may be temper is your problem
[2:24:07] maybe you have a short fuse I know what
[2:24:09] that's like
[2:24:11] God delivered me
[2:24:13] from
[2:24:15] temper to the point of insanity
[2:24:20] I I didn't realize how many things I
[2:24:22] needed Deliverance
[2:24:24] from
[2:24:26] but the scripture says he delivereth us
[2:24:29] out of them
[2:24:31] all
[2:24:34] so I encourage you this morning
[2:24:38] when you leave here
[2:24:41] that you become
[2:24:44] fully conscious
[2:24:47] that you've got to take control of the
[2:24:50] choices in your life
[2:24:53] and be conscious
[2:24:55] and I'll tell you
[2:24:57] when you choose him
[2:24:59] there's a fountain of joy that bubbles
[2:25:02] up inside of you
[2:25:04] when you know you've done the right
[2:25:05] thing
[2:25:08] it's so beautiful
[2:25:11] when you do
[2:25:14] the right thing
[2:25:18] I like this story
[2:25:20] I'll say it in closing at the musicians
[2:25:23] would come
[2:25:28] it's a story that
[2:25:31] came out of the town
[2:25:33] that I grew up in
[2:25:36] in San Diego
[2:25:39] um
[2:25:40] in downtown San Diego there's a church
[2:25:44] it was called Cathedral
[2:25:48] and there is a paper boy
[2:25:51] that
[2:25:52] had a paper route
[2:25:55] and if you've been to San Diego the
[2:25:57] airport sits at the bottom and then
[2:25:59] these Hills go up in town and the church
[2:26:02] sat up on one of the hills and
[2:26:05] the paper boy would do his route and as
[2:26:07] he'd come down the hill
[2:26:09] heal it throw his bike on the sidewalk
[2:26:13] and run into the chapel
[2:26:17] and he would kneel down and the priest
[2:26:20] would be in his little box saying
[2:26:22] confession and people are lighting
[2:26:24] candles and
[2:26:27] he would just run in and
[2:26:29] and you can play some Lori if you feel
[2:26:33] he would run in and kneel down and say
[2:26:35] Jesus this is Jimmy
[2:26:39] Jesus this is Jimmy
[2:26:43] Jesus
[2:26:45] this is Jimmy
[2:26:48] and he'd run out and get on his bike and
[2:26:51] finish his route
[2:26:54] and he did that every
[2:26:58] day
[2:27:00] and finally
[2:27:02] the priest
[2:27:06] just couldn't take it anymore
[2:27:09] for Jimmy he heard the bike slam up
[2:27:11] against the side of the church where it
[2:27:14] fell on the sidewalk with its paper bags
[2:27:18] across the back
[2:27:20] many of you may be too young to remember
[2:27:22] that
[2:27:24] and he ran into the Altar and said Jimmy
[2:27:28] this is Jesus
[2:27:31] and when he stood up the priest was
[2:27:33] standing there and he said Jimmy
[2:27:35] [Music]
[2:27:37] don't you have anything else to say or
[2:27:40] isn't there another place you can go
[2:27:47] and Jim he put his head down and
[2:27:51] kind of deflated
[2:27:55] and he got on his bike and started down
[2:27:57] the street and mined on what the priest
[2:28:00] said he didn't watch when he crossed the
[2:28:02] street and he was struck by a car
[2:28:08] they rushed him to the hospital
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:13] and they were in the hospital and
[2:28:18] maybe not a religious family but
[2:28:23] they called the family together and they
[2:28:25] called the priest in and they called
[2:28:27] everybody there and
[2:28:29] they didn't give Jimmy much hope
[2:28:34] but in the midst of it all
[2:28:37] all of a sudden they felt something in
[2:28:39] the room
[2:28:40] and they felt the presence
[2:28:43] and they heard a voice
[2:28:47] and the voice said Jimmy
[2:28:50] this is Jesus
[2:28:52] Jimmy
[2:28:54] this is Jesus
[2:28:56] Jimmy
[2:28:57] this is Jesus
[2:29:00] this morning would you say
[2:29:02] Jesus this is me
[2:29:05] let us Stand Together
[2:29:08] [Music]
[2:29:12] if you'll say
[2:29:15] Jesus it's me
[2:29:19] just the way I am
[2:29:22] all my mistakes
[2:29:24] [Music]
[2:29:27] all my confusion
[2:29:29] all my history all my failures
[2:29:33] but I'm standing here this morning
[2:29:35] saying Lord I want to choose you
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:40] I want to rededicate myself this morning
[2:29:43] to your word
[2:29:46] us
[2:29:48] I want to go back home and
[2:29:51] take the Bible and take the Vindicated
[2:29:55] message of this hour and
[2:29:58] go through my house and apply it
[2:30:03] I want to go to my closet and throw out
[2:30:08] I want to get that old pair of pants and
[2:30:11] I got tucked back in case I want to go
[2:30:13] someplace
[2:30:16] I'm going to go and clean up all the
[2:30:20] face paint
[2:30:25] I wanna
[2:30:28] get rid of
[2:30:29] [Music]
[2:30:31] all those things that aren't like you
[2:30:35] that's what it means to say Jimmy
[2:30:43] go this morning to him and say it's me
[2:30:45] Lord here I am
[2:30:48] I need a lot of help
[2:30:52] I need a lot of forgiveness
[2:30:55] I need a lot of change
[2:31:00] Lord there's a lot of things I've known
[2:31:02] better
[2:31:04] I can't change the past
[2:31:07] but I'm here for you to change the
[2:31:09] future
[2:31:12] if you'll say Jesus this is me
[2:31:17] Jesus this is me just the way I am this
[2:31:20] is me
[2:31:22] he'll whisper to you
[2:31:25] he'll call your name
[2:31:27] [Music]
[2:31:29] and say son this is Jesus
[2:31:32] daughter this is Jesus
[2:31:35] I'm here to do for you
[2:31:38] exceedingly and abundantly
[2:31:41] above what you could even ask or think
[2:31:46] you can't even imagine the peace I can
[2:31:49] give you
[2:31:50] the joy I can give you
[2:31:54] you can't even believe the wrecked life
[2:31:56] that I can fix
[2:32:00] for I Am The Lord Of Glory and with me
[2:32:03] all things are possible
[2:32:06] and I will no wise cast you out
[2:32:10] [Music]
[2:32:12] but if you'll come unto me I'll take you
[2:32:15] into my fold and I'll give you rest
[2:32:17] [Music]
[2:32:23] you have the courage this morning
[2:32:28] if you want to reconsecrate your life
[2:32:30] this morning
[2:32:32] you know there's things you've got to go
[2:32:34] take care of and you'd like to lift your
[2:32:36] hand to him this morning
[2:32:40] say Lord I want to pick you
[2:32:45] oh be honest with yourself
[2:32:48] you're making a choice right now
[2:32:52] you're making a choice
[2:32:54] are you too proud someone might see your
[2:32:57] hand up
[2:32:58] oh if you're ashamed of me before men
[2:33:03] I'll be ashamed of you before my father
[2:33:08] Lord this morning I have not roomed to
[2:33:11] ask someone to come forward
[2:33:13] [Music]
[2:33:19] but father you know every heart
[2:33:23] you know every mind battle that's going
[2:33:27] on right now
[2:33:29] you know every justification that's
[2:33:32] going on in the mind
[2:33:34] of man trying to make themselves right
[2:33:38] or trying to justify
[2:33:41] what they've done deep down in their
[2:33:43] heart when they know it's not right
[2:33:46] [Music]
[2:33:49] but Lord I trust that we all understand
[2:33:51] that
[2:33:54] this is choosing time
[2:33:56] [Music]
[2:34:01] it's time to
[2:34:03] make a choice
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:08] and this morning I trust that
[2:34:11] those that lifted their hands father
[2:34:15] may they know they're not on their own
[2:34:18] but you'll help them
[2:34:20] make every one of those choices
[2:34:22] you'll Supply the grace
[2:34:25] and the peace
[2:34:27] and the joy
[2:34:29] for we're not on this journey alone
