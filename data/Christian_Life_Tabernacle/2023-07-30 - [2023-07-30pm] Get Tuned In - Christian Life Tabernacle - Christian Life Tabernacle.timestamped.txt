[19:38] [Music]
[19:55] [Music]
[19:56] all praise is wonderful name one of
[20:00] these days in a moment in a twinkling of
[20:03] an eye
[20:04] we're gonna be changed
[20:06] isn't that exciting bless his wonderful
[20:08] name there's a song that was on my heart
[20:10] I want to sing
[20:13] draw me nearer to the cross
[20:16] it says Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross
[20:18] there
[20:19] a precious Fountain I hope this would be
[20:22] all right time
[20:23] I was just thinking you know we used to
[20:26] have those
[20:27] those song books those only belief song
[20:30] books get a little feedback up here if
[20:32] you can turn the monitor down just a
[20:34] little bit
[20:35] um
[20:36] but you know there's a reason that we
[20:37] sing the songs we sing
[20:39] and if you ever read some of them old
[20:42] books you'd open up and say these songs
[20:43] were sung by Brother Brianna and those I
[20:47] don't know about you but
[20:49] those songs mean a lot to me
[20:51] and you just find them all weaved into
[20:53] the word of God and weaved into people's
[20:55] testimony and I just bear with me but I
[20:58] thought this would bless you because I I
[21:00] think when when you sing a song it needs
[21:03] to Anchor into something you want to
[21:04] identify with it if it's somebody's
[21:06] testimony or somebody received from from
[21:09] the Lord and they sang that song well it
[21:12] can help pull you in into that presence
[21:15] or the meaning of that song and brother
[21:17] Branham he's going to pray for a Georgia
[21:20] Carter I believe he says I went up to
[21:21] the door and opened the door and
[21:24] and there she was laying there poor
[21:26] little thing in her lips quivering
[21:28] her mother startled couldn't finish
[21:30] telling her what had happened like that
[21:31] I walked over there to the bed and put
[21:33] my hands on her I said Georgia even
[21:36] Jesus Christ who gave me the vision of a
[21:38] lamb hung in the wilderness down here
[21:39] somewhere
[21:40] has appeared to me today in the woods
[21:42] and sent me here that I might lay hands
[21:45] upon you that you should be well I took
[21:48] her by the hand and I said as the Lord
[21:50] God has said to me in the name of the
[21:52] Lord Jesus Christ rise up and be whole
[21:54] and how was she to raise up limbs that
[21:57] big around hadn't moved for nine years
[21:58] and eight months laying on a bed but
[22:01] when God speaks he gives strength that's
[22:04] right taking her by the hand she looked
[22:07] at me like that her eyes looked like
[22:09] they had set I took her by the hand and
[22:11] I raised her from the bed less than a
[22:14] moment's time she was walking through
[22:15] the house she was screaming her mother
[22:17] pitched over in the room cold fainted
[22:19] the girl opened the door and walked out
[22:21] sat on the grass and began to bless the
[22:23] grass she began to bless the leaves
[22:25] bless her little heart the first time
[22:28] she'd seen leaves in the grass for
[22:29] nearly nine years if she had been laid
[22:31] in that bed and the people began to run
[22:33] from the neighborhood everywhere I'd
[22:35] done went outside toward the hills
[22:36] toward the church I couldn't stand
[22:38] around there you know anointing was just
[22:40] blessing all around started up the hill
[22:42] here she run back in the house sat down
[22:45] at the piano
[22:46] a few moments her father came from
[22:48] across the hill where a little bucket of
[22:49] milk from where there was a barn and
[22:51] come across he seen the crowd he began
[22:54] to hear the music and he said well what
[22:56] we got company listen to the people in
[22:58] there when he walked in the door they're
[23:00] set his only beloved daughter
[23:02] sat in their plane Jesus Keep Me Near
[23:05] The Cross
[23:06] there's a precious fountain free to all
[23:09] the healing string that flows from
[23:11] calvary's Mountain then sitting there he
[23:13] dropped his bucket through his arms
[23:15] around and said honey what is it she
[23:16] said
[23:17] that one you call to reprobate Lord
[23:20] Jesus sent him here
[23:21] he laid his hands on me and now
[23:25] I am well
[23:26] when Jesus speaks he gives strength I
[23:29] say Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross

[26:38] Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[26:40] pray
[26:41] amen amen if you have your Bibles let's
[26:45] turn to a couple scriptures real quick
[26:48] one found in the Book of Luke
[27:00] in the 24th
[27:05] the 20th or fourth chapter of the book
[27:07] of Luke
[27:33] let me see if I have that
[27:38] right here right I wrote it down
[27:42] and it said again we'll just read the
[27:45] 18th verse and then we'll jump over to
[27:48] the 27th verse you know the story well
[27:53] and
[27:55] and we know the story that Jesus came
[27:58] and and uh the two disciples uh were on
[28:03] their road to Emmaus and and we pick up
[28:06] the story and one of them whose name was
[28:09] cleopas answered saying unto him art
[28:12] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and
[28:17] hath not known the things which are come
[28:21] to pass therein these days you know he
[28:25] truly was a stranger wasn't it they
[28:28] really didn't know that
[28:30] and uh and he said unto them what things
[28:33] and they said concerning Jesus of
[28:37] Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[28:40] indeed and a word before God and all the
[28:44] people and then we'll read it the 27th
[28:47] verse and he began that Moses
[28:49] and all the prophets and expounded unto
[28:53] them
[28:54] in all the scriptures the things
[28:57] concerning himself
[28:59] and they drew nigh unto the village
[29:01] wherein they went and he made as though
[29:06] he would have gone further
[29:08] but they constrained him saying abide
[29:11] with us for it is toward evening and the
[29:15] day is far spent and he went in to tarry
[29:18] with them and it came to pass as he sat
[29:21] and meet with them he took bread and he
[29:24] blessed it and he break it and he gave
[29:27] it
[29:29] and gave it to them and their eyes were
[29:33] opened and they knew him and he vanished
[29:36] out of their sight and they said one to
[29:40] another did not our hearts burn within
[29:43] us well he talked with us by the way and
[29:48] while he opened to us the scriptures
[29:51] amen and let's also turn over up to the
[29:56] book of
[29:58] Timothy II uh chapter 2 Timothy the
[30:05] third chapter
[30:07] and we'll be short on our end tonight we
[30:10] have a baptismal service so this is
[30:12] really a baptismal service this evening
[30:15] and then we'll get right to our baptism
[30:18] here in just a moment
[30:20] he says for this
[30:22] for this know also
[30:25] that in the last days perilous times
[30:28] shall come
[30:31] for men shall be lovers of their own
[30:33] selves
[30:35] covetousness boasters proud blasphemers
[30:39] Disobedience to parents unthankful
[30:42] Unholy without natural affections truce
[30:47] Breakers false accusers
[30:50] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[30:54] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[30:58] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[31:01] God
[31:02] having a form of godliness but denying
[31:05] the power thereof from such turn away
[31:09] for
[31:10] of this sort are they which creep into
[31:13] houses and Lead captive silly women
[31:16] Laden with sins LED away with thy
[31:19] diverse lust
[31:21] ever learning and never able to come to
[31:25] the knowledge of the truth Heavenly
[31:28] Father we ask you to bless us in your
[31:30] precious name we pray amen amen you may
[31:34] be seated
[31:45] I think one of the greatest
[31:48] things that the believer
[31:51] has to come to grip with
[31:54] now more than ever
[31:56] is the acceptance
[32:00] and I've maybe touched on this a time or
[32:03] two before and probably will continue to
[32:06] touch on it but it's the acceptance of
[32:09] your election
[32:11] to that there's nothing that
[32:14] we did within ourselves he said you are
[32:18] my disciples he said you have not chosen
[32:21] me I have chosen you and there's
[32:24] something very special about that that I
[32:30] think in the hour that we're moving into
[32:34] and the place that God's taking us that
[32:39] the believer if he keeps looking at
[32:42] himself in the mirror and he keeps he
[32:46] keeps trying to
[32:48] bring this outward man
[32:52] into a place of
[32:56] um
[32:58] how can I say a worthiness or he keeps
[33:01] looking at the self that he is thinking
[33:04] that if he can do a few things that he
[33:08] can put some effort into it that he can
[33:11] make the difference
[33:13] and
[33:14] the difference can be made but it's not
[33:18] going to be made by you or your flesh
[33:21] the difference is going to be made from
[33:24] the seed that is in you that that is
[33:29] what the believer finally has got to
[33:32] come to the realization of is there
[33:35] something in me that's going to
[33:38] transform me and he's got to realize
[33:42] from that point that there's a
[33:45] connection that you make with that which
[33:50] is in you that there's something inside
[33:53] of your heart that just says Amen to
[33:57] every word of God
[33:59] it comes from something deeper within
[34:02] you than than you can even understand
[34:06] even though you're warring with all the
[34:09] elements around you yet down inside
[34:12] there's a voice there's something that's
[34:14] connected something that's put there and
[34:17] that's him and so I'd like to just take
[34:21] this little message that my heart turned
[34:24] toward while I was on
[34:27] up with my mother and it's modern events
[34:32] are made clear by prophecy and
[34:36] that that's a very unique title because
[34:41] we look around and we see that things
[34:46] have come to the exact same
[34:50] uh condition that Timothy spoke of would
[34:55] come it would be perilous times and so
[35:00] we understand that the reason these
[35:03] times are here is because they were
[35:06] prophesied to be here the events doesn't
[35:10] turn determine the prophecy the prophecy
[35:15] has already determined the events the
[35:18] the reason that everything is is in the
[35:21] condition that it's in is because of the
[35:25] prophecy that was spoken that man no
[35:28] longer wished to retain God in their
[35:31] thinking so God gave them over to a
[35:34] reprobate mind so by by being able to to
[35:39] look at the events that are coming to
[35:43] pass according to prophecy then it
[35:47] causes us that there's a realization
[35:49] that there's prophecies
[35:52] concerning us and I believe that's what
[35:55] our brother preached he said don't miss
[35:57] the prophecy
[35:58] and we'd like to expound on that uh just
[36:02] added a little bit more certainly
[36:04] couldn't preach it any better but
[36:07] to say that if if all these other things
[36:10] around us are true then other prophecies
[36:14] concerning us must be true also and and
[36:18] so then you can stand back and you can
[36:21] look at yourself and say well what did
[36:24] God promise he promised he'd have an
[36:27] elect seed
[36:29] he promised that in every age in order
[36:33] to prove his word he plants a seed there
[36:37] that will be able to accept that word
[36:41] that that is how that he chose to prove
[36:46] his word
[36:48] he chose his word to
[36:51] to have a heart that would receive it it
[36:55] would be no good if they ever produced a
[36:58] radio wave or a television wave if they
[37:01] didn't have a receiver
[37:05] you know there had to be something that
[37:07] could receive it in order to turn it
[37:10] into a radio Sound or a
[37:15] a visual transmission or whether it just
[37:20] can't be transmitted it's got to be
[37:21] transmitted from something to something
[37:25] and that's how the the frequencies work
[37:29] is they get they can send it on a
[37:32] certain frequency or a certain
[37:34] wavelength in no my way am I Electronics
[37:37] person at all but I know that they can
[37:40] adjust that receiver they'll receive
[37:43] that in every other signal is not
[37:46] received it's blocked down and so that
[37:49] you cannot you can get a receiver and
[37:53] you can create something that will only
[37:55] receive uh this signal
[38:00] now if you were blessed with that
[38:04] receiver
[38:06] that you could receive the signal then
[38:09] everybody else around you that wasn't
[38:12] receiving the signal would think that
[38:15] you're false
[38:17] [Music]
[38:21] no this does not look that I can go
[38:24] through all my channels that this
[38:26] frequency doesn't exist what you're
[38:29] hearing isn't true what you're hearing
[38:32] isn't real uh there's uh where are you
[38:37] getting this from
[38:39] it's because they weren't ordained to
[38:43] receive the signal
[38:45] yeah okay there there was no connection
[38:49] to put in there and and then that that
[38:53] immediately causes people to begin to to
[38:56] to look at the outside the outside's the
[39:00] same
[39:01] you know okay you know everything about
[39:06] it on the outsides the same if this
[39:09] building's the same as a lot of churches
[39:11] it's got people sitting in it like a lot
[39:14] of churches they're all reading the same
[39:16] Bible like a lot of churches
[39:18] everything's the same but what what
[39:21] what's the difference
[39:24] amen because that that that's the whole
[39:28] key I I thought our brother brought that
[39:30] out he said we're different but what
[39:32] makes you different you've got to come
[39:35] to the realization I do we all do have
[39:38] got to come to the realization of what
[39:41] makes us different and what makes us
[39:43] different is what was put into us from
[39:47] the foundation of the beginning of the
[39:49] world and what he put in US is what has
[39:54] the power to transform us
[39:58] right the the signal if I can't comes to
[40:02] the seed and it makes the seed transform
[40:05] into what it was planted for just like
[40:09] the Rays of the sun and the think if you
[40:12] plant a field out there you could put a
[40:15] different kind of seed every way and the
[40:18] sun would come down but just that one
[40:20] seed has got an identification already
[40:24] within it that when it receives the sun
[40:27] rays and it receives the the water and
[40:30] it receives the nutrient from the earth
[40:32] it produces something that's completely
[40:34] different than the seed next to it so
[40:38] you couldn't say it was the ground you
[40:41] couldn't say it was the sun you couldn't
[40:43] say it was the water
[40:46] what what made that seed different was
[40:51] how it was created in the beginning
[40:55] okay so you're not made different by
[40:59] your decision you're not made different
[41:02] by your determination to live a good
[41:07] life you're not made different by any of
[41:10] those things what made you different is
[41:13] what he planted in you
[41:16] that's why he said my sheep know my
[41:18] voice and another they won't follow and
[41:22] you have not chosen me I have chosen you
[41:26] well that's strange you think in one way
[41:28] but now you understand how that he chose
[41:31] you
[41:31] how that he chose you you didn't ask for
[41:34] it
[41:36] but you got it
[41:40] and there comes a time when you get real
[41:42] thankful
[41:43] you have it you really thank the Lord
[41:46] and so we see that in this story that
[41:49] we're talking about that
[41:54] Jesus is walking with these guys and
[41:56] they ask them are you a stranger
[41:58] don't you know what's happening aren't
[42:01] you aren't you familiar
[42:05] with the events that have transpired
[42:09] well they had no idea really what
[42:13] Advance had transpired
[42:16] you understand they looked at it they
[42:19] saw the the movement of the government
[42:22] they saw the movement of the church they
[42:25] they saw all these movements going on
[42:29] they saw all these reactions they saw
[42:31] all these responses but they didn't
[42:34] really see what was going on as far as
[42:37] the Fulfillment of the scriptures
[42:41] now and I say that to us because he
[42:43] makes this statement he says do you
[42:46] realize that that's promised again in
[42:50] this very age that we're living in
[42:52] amen that that the people would see the
[42:55] church moving they would see the
[42:57] government moving they would see all the
[43:00] circumstances and all the commotion and
[43:03] all the contrast in all the conflict
[43:06] because every time God moves in his word
[43:08] there's a conflict
[43:11] there's a there's a there's a clash
[43:14] there's there's something that's going
[43:16] on and The Clash that's going on in the
[43:20] world today the wars the rumors of wars
[43:22] the political unrest this social
[43:25] movement and that social movement uh the
[43:28] the whole the transgender thing the
[43:31] whole political thing the whole uh
[43:33] indictment thing all these things the
[43:37] bribery things all that stuff is going
[43:39] on it is is not really what's going on
[43:50] those events are not describing prophecy
[43:56] prophecies describing the the events
[43:59] that are going on it's because of what
[44:02] God's doing that all this is happening
[44:07] now this is three to Second further what
[44:11] he said just uh this is paragraph 19
[44:13] modern events made clear by prophecy I
[44:17] think it's 12 uh uh 12 6.
[44:23] he said do you realize that it's
[44:27] promised again in this very age that
[44:29] we're living in the lady of cnh the
[44:32] seventh Church age that we're in now is
[44:36] naked miserable blind and don't know it
[44:42] so that's where they are but now listen
[44:47] to why
[44:50] the world
[44:52] is in the condition it's in
[44:55] the same as he blinded them back there
[44:58] for the purpose of getting his message
[45:02] through to the elected people
[45:08] he promised to do the same thing today
[45:15] the whole purpose of this
[45:18] is to get this message through to you
[45:23] the elect people
[45:25] okay the message is for the elect people
[45:28] you click I said once you have that
[45:31] receiver in you won't you have that seed
[45:34] in you that predestinated part in you
[45:38] that separates you from thing you're
[45:41] going to receive something that they
[45:43] just can't receive they just don't see
[45:48] and that that's what's separating you
[45:51] but the thing visit what good does it do
[45:54] you if you've got the receiver if you're
[45:56] not going to tune in on the message
[46:00] of what what's transpiring what what's
[46:03] going on so we can clearly see that the
[46:08] modern events that are happening around
[46:10] us are are truly made clear To Us by the
[46:16] prophecy concerning us
[46:19] that God would have an elect lady
[46:23] he would have someone that he would call
[46:25] out that he would separate and have them
[46:29] come out from amongst them and be
[46:32] separate and so we could see that that
[46:36] uh that that comes to that beautiful
[46:39] place he says over here
[46:42] and and I think this is a another good
[46:45] thing that that we can look at just for
[46:49] a second we'll probably go farther at
[46:51] later times he said in paragraph three
[46:55] he said and he is the word Saint John 1.
[46:59] in the beginning was the word and the
[47:02] Word was with God and the Word was God
[47:05] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[47:08] Among Us Hebrews 13 8 he's the same
[47:11] yesterday today and forever therefore
[47:15] we're living in the day when the
[47:18] manifestation of the word of God has
[47:23] come to a different age than the
[47:27] Pentecost age
[47:30] so it's come to a different
[47:33] manifestation than the Pentecostal
[47:37] manifestation and we found a great
[47:40] conflict in that today because people
[47:43] were wanting to take the Pentecostal
[47:47] manifestations and use it as
[47:50] manifestation for the message
[47:53] took in other words we want to vindicate
[47:56] the message by trying to use the
[47:58] vindications of another age and we're
[48:02] not in that manifestation so there's
[48:04] something else that's going to be
[48:07] manifested you said well we still pray
[48:09] for the sick he always was a Healer
[48:12] can we still dream dreams we can still
[48:15] dream dreams we can still see Visions
[48:17] but that's not the evidence of what's
[48:20] transpiring in this age
[48:23] Paul said all these things will do if
[48:26] God so permits but let us move on to
[48:29] perfection
[48:31] so there's something else that these
[48:35] modern events is causing the elect to
[48:40] zero in on the prophecies concerning
[48:44] them
[48:45] all right I hope I can say very clear
[48:50] the modern events that are trans that
[48:54] are transpiring and the prophecies that
[48:58] are coming to pass
[48:59] they're there to cause the elect
[49:04] to zero in on the prophecies concerning
[49:07] themselves
[49:10] that I know it doesn't do me no good to
[49:13] keep sitting around and looking out and
[49:16] saying this is coming to pass this is
[49:18] coming this way and never coming to the
[49:21] places what's coming to pass about me
[49:25] what am I bringing to pass what what
[49:28] prophecies am I fulfilling what what's
[49:32] my place in the plan what's my personal
[49:35] uh place my my eating my bread with
[49:39] singleness of heart and working out my
[49:41] own salvation with fear and trembling
[49:43] what is it bound to when it comes down
[49:46] to me again what am I seeing fulfilled
[49:49] in my life what what are the
[49:51] expectations that I have for myself
[49:56] what part am I playing
[50:00] foreign
[50:01] if that's been prophesied
[50:04] and we said the reason that it's coming
[50:07] to pass is so he can get his message to
[50:10] the elect
[50:11] to then what I'm interested in is what
[50:15] plea has prophesied about the elect are
[50:20] those prophecies transpiring in me
[50:24] and
[50:29] if I'm going to believe them I've got to
[50:32] hear them
[50:34] because Faith cometh by hearing can hear
[50:37] it by the word of God
[50:39] you can you know what I mean the signal
[50:42] can be out there but if you don't turn
[50:44] on the Transformer or the trans receiver
[50:47] it's not going to get get the signal
[50:53] so if I could I don't have a title but I
[50:56] in fact one just come to my mind it
[50:58] would be turn yourself on
[51:01] and uh
[51:02] get tuned in
[51:05] you know
[51:07] when I was a hippie it was drop out and
[51:10] you know don't tune in at all you know
[51:14] but this is the elect lady so if we find
[51:17] out so you you can't you you've got to
[51:20] step back yes there was a Pentecostal
[51:23] age
[51:24] yes yes there was a great manifestations
[51:27] in everything but could you understand
[51:30] why that was
[51:34] I mean what the what does
[51:37] why the scripture decided that it would
[51:42] come to a shock let me just read it to
[51:45] you it struck me when I said it he said
[51:49] and he's talking you know how it tried
[51:51] he says finally it goes into the tassel
[51:54] that's John Wesley in the Wesley age
[51:57] and it had the pollen dropped back
[52:00] and paragraph 34. from there came the
[52:04] Pentecostal age so close
[52:07] just like the real grain of wheat if you
[52:10] look at the stock but if you'll take
[52:14] that weed and move it back there's not
[52:17] one grain in it at all it's only a shut
[52:21] in the shape of the grain
[52:24] but it it sat there
[52:27] for the purpose to shelter the grain
[52:35] now just think of that
[52:37] now okay at the end I hope this is in
[52:42] wrong for me to say but as I I was out
[52:46] at my mom's there in Michigan my mom's
[52:49] sister's house visited my mom my mom
[52:52] watches the the television that she
[52:55] watches she watches Mass on television
[52:59] and and the rosary on television so I
[53:03] sat down it can you know flip the button
[53:05] and and there and there's a whole
[53:07] section of religious
[53:10] channels there
[53:11] and and as I pretend to watch I mean you
[53:14] can you just can't believe what you see
[53:18] I mean from every end of the spectrum
[53:21] you know and and of course you you know
[53:25] my my favorite I've always uh kind of in
[53:28] my heart wish that someday I'd get the
[53:31] opportunity to cross paths but my
[53:34] favorite uh television preacher Joyce
[53:37] Myers is there
[53:40] and and I mean you know she's got those
[53:43] big earrings like probably I guess like
[53:46] saddle stirrups I believe and and he got
[53:49] the big and her hair is cut so short and
[53:53] and I mean she's just everything total
[53:56] opposite of the word of God to me and
[54:00] she's got a great big following and
[54:02] she's she's saying all these things and
[54:04] a lot of things she says is good
[54:08] like our brother said it's just bears
[54:10] and you can just go down down down down
[54:12] down down and and all this and the music
[54:16] and and uh
[54:19] and uh uh you know uh the brother Jimmy
[54:25] Swaggart and and he I'm telling you the
[54:28] guy can sing
[54:29] I mean I I just would sit there and
[54:32] close my eyes and just listen to him
[54:34] singing and he's got good lyrics and
[54:37] good songs and and there's nobody that
[54:39] can cry the way he can cry and he just
[54:42] tugs at your heart and and you sit back
[54:46] and you see all this thing and then you
[54:48] start looking at the range that it's all
[54:52] covering it and you you sit back and
[54:55] says none of them are saying the same
[54:56] thing
[54:58] but what was it for
[55:02] why was it allowed why did it come in
[55:05] the form that it came in why did it come
[55:09] with the with all the healing that went
[55:13] forth and all the uh emotion that went
[55:17] forth and all the gifts that went forth
[55:19] and all those things did you ever
[55:21] realize the prophet of God said that was
[55:24] a for our protection yes
[55:26] okay let me just read this in close in
[55:30] this quote he says there's not one one
[55:34] grain in it all it's only shot in the
[55:37] shape of a grain but it was set there
[55:40] for a purpose
[55:44] so it was set there for a purpose not a
[55:48] purpose to run back to
[55:51] not a purpose to reproduce
[55:55] so many people miss when he said that
[55:58] this is the restoration of the Faith of
[56:00] Our Fathers that it wasn't the
[56:02] restoration of the manifestation it was
[56:06] the restoration of the revelation
[56:08] and the Revelation that they had was
[56:11] this was the Fulfillment of all the law
[56:15] and all the prophets
[56:19] and that the gospel they went out and
[56:22] preached was the Gospel of the Old
[56:25] Testament fulfilled that's what they
[56:28] went and preached that Jesus fulfilled
[56:30] all the things concerning the prophet
[56:33] when Jesus talked to him he started at
[56:36] Moses
[56:37] because there were no Epistles
[56:40] and he started at Moses and he went
[56:42] through all the scriptures concerning
[56:45] themselves and their heart burned within
[56:48] them
[56:49] so now their Revelation was that he was
[56:52] the Fulfillment of the word of God so
[56:56] the faith of the fathers was the
[56:59] recognition of what prophecies were
[57:02] being fulfilled in their day
[57:07] that they were chosen
[57:11] they were elected to stand into a
[57:15] position and bring this good news
[57:20] and that's what the disciples did all
[57:22] except for Paul because he wasn't called
[57:25] in that he was called for a different
[57:28] purpose which was to bring the same
[57:30] gospel to the Gentiles and he was gifted
[57:33] to do that the rest of them brought it
[57:36] back to their Brethren and were telling
[57:38] them that that these this word has been
[57:42] fulfilled
[57:44] so it came to a purpose
[57:47] Pentecost had its purpose it was to
[57:50] shelter the Grain and tell if the Sun
[57:53] hits it like that it'd kill it
[57:58] another kept the sunlight of this
[58:01] message
[58:03] didn't have Pentecost
[58:06] to shelter the crane that the The Virtue
[58:11] and the glory of this message would have
[58:14] killed it
[58:18] you might not ever be able to see that
[58:21] because you were
[58:24] raised in a
[58:26] Pentecostal age where the supernatural
[58:30] people begin to feel the spirit
[58:32] but can you imagine people that have
[58:34] never had the spirit
[58:37] and all of a sudden one stood in their
[58:39] midst and discerned the thoughts and
[58:42] intents of their heart called them out
[58:44] laid hands on the sick that would have
[58:45] killed them
[58:46] they wouldn't have known what to do with
[58:48] it but that's not that that's not our
[58:52] end
[58:52] so that was the purpose he said it was a
[58:57] protection
[58:58] so that he could give the message to the
[59:02] elect
[59:03] and as we go on he says it's got to stay
[59:06] there until a certain time
[59:08] and all the life leaves the shock
[59:11] as it left the stock left the pollen
[59:15] leaves the shut and goes into the wheat
[59:18] the forms again just like it was down in
[59:23] the ground now all of us know
[59:27] that whenever a message is given
[59:30] in three years they form an organization
[59:33] and when they do it kills it right there
[59:37] it did it in the days of Luther it did
[59:40] in the days of Wesley it did it in the
[59:42] days of Alexander Campbell and the rest
[59:45] of them
[59:47] and it did it in the days of Pentecost
[59:50] exactly you get to a you get to a place
[59:55] each one gets starchy and gets off and
[59:59] they can't receive new revelation
[1:00:04] they couldn't receive it well how come
[1:00:07] you received it
[1:00:09] they didn't have anything in them to
[1:00:11] believe with
[1:00:13] why do you believe
[1:00:16] why do you see it
[1:00:20] are you so brilliant
[1:00:24] oh
[1:00:25] there was something in you
[1:00:28] it was a gift of God for you to receive
[1:00:31] it
[1:00:32] what a blessing it was it was just a
[1:00:35] gift of life
[1:00:37] for you by his choosing so beautifully
[1:00:41] given he said
[1:00:45] and you get to a place he took he says
[1:00:49] they settled down and there they are
[1:00:53] and and they die
[1:00:55] and the life goes right through that and
[1:00:58] goes right on to make the weed and when
[1:01:02] the wheat come that life that traveled
[1:01:05] through that wheat the resurrection
[1:01:08] brings the whole thing out yes brings it
[1:01:12] up for the rapture
[1:01:16] and I'm just going to read what another
[1:01:20] uh well I I think I'll just uh
[1:01:23] I'll just read this statement and then
[1:01:25] we'll go right to water baptism
[1:01:29] it says we're not living in a
[1:01:31] Pentecostal age we're living in another
[1:01:33] age
[1:01:34] amen see we're not living in a Methodist
[1:01:37] age we're living in another age we're
[1:01:40] living up here to the bride age the
[1:01:44] calling out of the church and getting it
[1:01:47] together for the Rapture that's the age
[1:01:51] we're now living to my honest opinion
[1:01:55] that's exactly the truth
[1:02:04] what are you called for
[1:02:07] somebody here's called for the rapture
[1:02:11] Hallelujah
[1:02:13] amen it was not this age it's not
[1:02:16] another age we're not called to to go
[1:02:19] reproduce
[1:02:21] the gifts again to to go back all those
[1:02:25] in what we're called to do is have the
[1:02:28] Resurrection Life in us if the same
[1:02:30] spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell
[1:02:33] in you it will Quicken also your mortal
[1:02:37] body we could go a much more on that
[1:02:40] subject but uh I just want to close
[1:02:45] again with this by seeing the things
[1:02:48] that are transpiring around us
[1:02:51] we understand that as it was in the days
[1:02:55] of Noah
[1:02:56] so shall it be in the day of the
[1:02:58] revelation of the son of man as it was
[1:03:00] in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so
[1:03:03] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:03:06] man and we can truly see the Union
[1:03:10] that God's bringing together
[1:03:13] the invisible Union of Christ in this
[1:03:16] bride so we can set ourselves and
[1:03:19] understand what prophecies are
[1:03:21] concerning us that we're called to
[1:03:24] become one with the word of God
[1:03:27] to have that nature to have that Spirit
[1:03:30] to have that wisdom to have isaf that we
[1:03:33] might see character gold Trident fire
[1:03:37] white rain that our nakedness doesn't
[1:03:39] appear and we can focus in on what it is
[1:03:45] that we're preparing for we're not
[1:03:48] trying to recover an age gone by
[1:03:51] we're not trying to manifest in age gone
[1:03:54] by we're not trying to prove this
[1:03:57] message by an age gone by and I'll just
[1:04:01] uh I was I might as well read this
[1:04:03] statement because uh
[1:04:07] it's so good
[1:04:10] um
[1:04:11] and that if I I don't know if brother
[1:04:14] Adrian is going to help me with the
[1:04:16] baptism but we'll get ready at this time
[1:04:21] he says notice we find this as paragraph
[1:04:24] 100
[1:04:25] notice we find today that people there's
[1:04:29] many people just can't believe it even
[1:04:32] Spirit-filled people
[1:04:35] I'm going to give you
[1:04:38] I'm going to give you one it'll choke
[1:04:41] you
[1:04:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean
[1:04:45] you're going in
[1:04:48] not at all
[1:04:50] not on that
[1:04:54] don't have anything to do with you your
[1:04:57] soul
[1:04:59] that's the baptism see
[1:05:02] here in the inside
[1:05:05] soul in here
[1:05:07] has to come from God
[1:05:10] but then on the outside you have five
[1:05:13] senses
[1:05:15] five inlets
[1:05:17] to your contact your Earthly home the
[1:05:20] inside you have a spirit
[1:05:23] and there you have five Outlets your
[1:05:26] conscience and love and so forth five
[1:05:29] Outlets to that Spirit but remember in
[1:05:32] that spirit
[1:05:34] you can be baptized with the genuine
[1:05:36] spirit of God and still be lost if the
[1:05:40] soul that lives that was ordained
[1:05:45] of God
[1:05:52] oh that's that answers it do you
[1:05:56] understand that's what you've got to
[1:05:59] look at what's in my soul
[1:06:03] but what's in my soul my soul my there's
[1:06:09] something in my soul or something that's
[1:06:12] receiving this okay that believes that
[1:06:15] even though I'm struggling with my flesh
[1:06:18] even though I'm struggling with things I
[1:06:20] I can't deny it like Peter said where
[1:06:22] can I go that alone hath the words of
[1:06:25] eternal life it's settled in your heart
[1:06:28] this is the truth
[1:06:32] that's the part
[1:06:36] that if if we're going to go forward
[1:06:41] that's if I can say that that's the
[1:06:44] ultimate faith of the believer
[1:06:47] it's not secondhand Faith I've got the
[1:06:50] seed because I got this feeling I've got
[1:06:53] the seed because I've got this gift I've
[1:06:55] got the seed because I got this baptism
[1:06:58] when it comes down to the point it says
[1:07:00] I believe this I didn't believe it of
[1:07:03] myself it's in my heart I see it's true
[1:07:06] it doesn't matter what condition I'm in
[1:07:09] it doesn't matter what I'm involved in
[1:07:11] alls I can do is there's something
[1:07:13] inside of me that says Amen to every
[1:07:16] word of God and I want this life that's
[1:07:20] in the seed that eternal life I want
[1:07:23] that life to be in me
[1:07:25] all right thank you
[1:07:28] we get into a whole brand new definition
[1:07:32] of what
[1:07:34] the Holy Ghost did that's right that's
[1:07:37] right and it goes Way Beyond experience
[1:07:40] it is an experience
[1:07:43] but it's generated from two different
[1:07:45] places
[1:07:47] one's generated from within once
[1:07:50] generated from without amen and that
[1:07:54] part that's in you comes from God
[1:07:57] believe it
[1:08:01] don't look at yourself and say why
[1:08:04] because I look at you and I shake my
[1:08:06] head and they go more you've got to be
[1:08:09] kidding me why did you do this why'd you
[1:08:12] pick this guy
[1:08:16] but if he did you're going to spend
[1:08:18] eternity with them if he picked you
[1:08:21] so little children love one another
[1:08:23] don't judge one another the seed will
[1:08:27] prevail
[1:08:29] seed will prevail it will bring to path
[1:08:33] what he promised at the path we're not
[1:08:36] going back to another age we're coming
[1:08:38] to maturity the acceptance improving his
[1:08:42] word he said Jesus believed what the
[1:08:46] word of God said he was
[1:08:49] he said can't we believe what the word
[1:08:52] of God says we are that perfect faith is
[1:08:58] when you believe and accept that seed is
[1:09:02] in you despite yourself
[1:09:08] when I see hippie that seed was there
[1:09:12] but that seed found me
[1:09:14] amen and it separated me
[1:09:18] I didn't want to stop
[1:09:23] I didn't
[1:09:25] I didn't want to quit
[1:09:27] it made me quit
[1:09:30] it made what I love become so miserable
[1:09:34] to me
[1:09:37] that it pushed me
[1:09:39] and restrain me and took me into a
[1:09:42] prisoner to where I finally found my
[1:09:45] peace and it was in The Voice
[1:09:48] of the word of God for the hour amen so
[1:09:51] we're just going to go prepare us for

[1:16:45] stories unfolding here
[1:16:48] the Holy Spirit falls down and induced
[1:16:51] the disciples with power
[1:16:54] for the purpose for them to go into all
[1:16:56] the world and preach the gospel
[1:16:58] and have the same Vindication signs that
[1:17:02] Vindicated
[1:17:04] the message that Jesus brought to
[1:17:08] continue to vindicate that message
[1:17:11] and that message is still Vindicated

[1:17:21] changed all to the old all through the
[1:17:24] new through every age the Vindication
[1:17:27] has always been the same
[1:17:29] and then the disciples begin to ask
[1:17:32] answer that and he said he said to them
[1:17:35] he said therefore let all the house of
[1:17:38] Israel know assuredly
[1:17:40] that God hath made the same Jesus
[1:17:54] he had men and Brethren what shall we do
[1:17:58] then Peter said unto them repent
[1:18:01] and be baptized every one of you and
[1:18:04] then in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:07] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[1:18:10] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:12] for the promises unto you
[1:18:15] and unto your children
[1:18:18] and to all that are afar off even as
[1:18:23] many as the Lord Our God shall call amen
[1:18:26] and with many other words he did testify
[1:18:29] in a short saying save yourself from
[1:18:32] this up towards generation amen Angel
[1:18:36] today has felt a pull in his heart to
[1:18:41] turn his heart to the Lord
[1:18:45] repented of his Sins Not to me but to
[1:18:48] his maker and now he's going to follow
