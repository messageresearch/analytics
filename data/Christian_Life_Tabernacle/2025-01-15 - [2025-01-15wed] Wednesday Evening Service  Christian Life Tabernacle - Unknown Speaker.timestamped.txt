[8:56] if you could come but David Jr if you
[8:58] could just come in take the needs before
[9:00] the church
[9:06] [Music]
[9:15] amen let's go
[9:17] before Heavenly Father truly each heart
[9:20] that's bowed
[9:23] can think deeply upon where we would be
[9:26] without your grace
[9:27] father Lord It's that that which binds
[9:30] our hearts together and father there
[9:32] would be no hope there would be no
[9:34] consolation there would be no Comfort
[9:37] Lord the greatest treasure we have is
[9:39] knowing you and we're so thankful for
[9:42] that father we ask tonight Lord that
[9:44] you'd make yourself known Lord for who
[9:47] you are as a comforter who you are as a
[9:49] prince of peace who you are as a Healer
[9:52] father you're mighty deliver and you're
[9:53] mindful of the least of our needs and
[9:57] Lord if we can catch that and surely we
[10:00] can truly bow our heads and block
[10:03] everything else out and just meditate
[10:05] upon you and father our hearts could SE
[10:08] seek after you completely father we're
[10:11] asking that you'd have such a
[10:12] preeminence in this service father that
[10:14] Satan is he would try to distract
[10:16] through the different Avenues father
[10:18] that each one would make a deliberate
[10:20] effort to cast them down and Lord to
[10:22] lift you up and speak the name of Jesus
[10:25] and Lord to think and make a deliberate
[10:27] effort to invite you by each their way
[10:30] and their heart to minister to their
[10:32] need father we thank you for the
[10:34] requests that were mentioned Lord
[10:36] because it's a testimony of those who
[10:38] are asking for you to come upon the
[10:40] scene Lord you still cast out Satan you
[10:43] still manifest the price paid of Calvary
[10:47] Lord cancer is
[10:49] defeated Lord and we ask for your
[10:51] healing touch for our pastor oh God that
[10:53] yes Lord
[10:55] there's a doctor's testimony that it
[10:57] could correct itself Lord but we're
[10:59] asking for your intervention father Lord
[11:02] that you'd provide the healing touch and
[11:04] Lord that you would receive the glory
[11:06] and father there's many things man can
[11:08] do oh God but we're wanting your hand oh
[11:12] Father we're committing ourselves into
[11:14] that asking you'd have again your way in
[11:17] this service committing each one to you

[26:01] the things of the world and you know
[26:04] this ought to be a a a place that you
[26:06] come and it should be a Haven of
[26:10] Rest and
[26:12] uh Satan would want to change that you
[26:15] know you want somebody to sit in your
[26:18] spot or park in your place
[26:22] or he wants you to feel uncomfortable or
[26:26] you find out you didn't wear the right
[26:28] matching outfit and or somebody's collar
[26:31] is up and the only thing you can think
[26:33] about the whole service is if you should
[26:34] go flip their collar
[26:35] down you know it's funny how little
[26:38] things like that can can disrupt but
[26:40] what we want to do let's go up a little
[26:43] step
[26:44] higher come up higher John let's let's
[26:46] get into the Eternal realm now let's get
[26:49] past the veil and the work week and know
[26:52] that right now is a predestinated moment
[26:56] in time where the great creator of
[26:58] heavens and earth
[27:00] designed that he would come by our way
[27:02] and this would be an opportunity that he
[27:04] would speak to you and that whatever
[27:07] cares whatever
[27:08] burdens you could lay it down at his
[27:10] feet and you could be honest with him
[27:14] you know sometimes you feel like you got
[27:16] nobody to talk to and nobody could
[27:18] understand you but there's one amen
[27:20] there's one that knows why don't we just
[27:22] go before him Lord
[27:25] Jesus so many times Lord we look to the
[27:29] things of the world we we run to the
[27:32] medicine
[27:34] cabinet we go to
[27:36] Google Lord that's the age that we live
[27:39] in where devices and Technology dominate
[27:42] our thinking and our
[27:45] attention Lord we want to be reminded
[27:47] that you're the solution for everything
[27:51] Lord whatever the need is naturally or
[27:54] spiritually
[27:56] Lord you are the answer
[27:58] [Music]
[27:59] there's a thirst inside of us Lord
[28:01] that's thirsting
[28:03] and Lord as you've been showing us
[28:06] through our pastor and the message of
[28:08] the
[28:09] hour as your Prophet once
[28:13] said you want to reveal this this great
[28:17] secret mystery Revelation to us but we
[28:21] let so many things take it out of us we
[28:24] let our jobs and our family and the
[28:27] cares of this life
[28:28] life Lord we want to tell you we're
[28:31] sorry for that tonight
[28:33] and just ask Lord that you'd forgive us
[28:37] Lord where
[28:38] we we haven't been diligent like we we
[28:41] should
[28:42] and we want to take the message that
[28:45] you've been giving to us
[28:47] Lord we want to be successful Christians
[28:50] and we know lord it's not something that
[28:52] we do but it's something that you do in
[28:55] us we want to yield to that Lord and say
[28:58] am men to the word and Lord there's a
[29:00] lot of hurting hearts and there's a lot
[29:02] of needs
[29:04] here we need you Lord just to come and
[29:08] provide the comfort and the healing that
[29:11] we so need Lord and we know that you use
[29:14] the body to bring those things Lord all
[29:16] of us joined together is your ministry
[29:19] and so may we just look out on the needs
[29:22] of one another and be obedient servants
[29:25] tonight and get behind the word Lord and
[29:28] just look forward for you to have your
[29:30] perfect will and way in the service we
[29:32] commit this time to you and ask these
[29:34] blessings in your name the Lord Jesus
[29:36] Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles
[29:39] let's just turn in uh the book of Psalms
[29:41] at
[29:43] 42 um I just remember Brother David in
[29:47] prayer um his eye is is is causing him
[29:51] some problem that I think we got a good
[29:53] report that the uh the blood that was in
[29:56] his eye wasn't in the retina or it's not
[29:58] separating so it is something that can
[30:00] clear up but but we want to remember his
[30:04] um um he wanted us to listen to about
[30:07] another 20 minutes out of the message of
[30:10] thirst and as we're reading out of
[30:12] Psalms 42 this would be um the text that
[30:17] brother Brandon would take for this
[30:19] sermon so let's just read that in Psalms
[30:22] 42 it says as the heart panteth after
[30:23] the water Brook so panteth my soul after
[30:26] thee oh God my soul thirst for God for
[30:30] the Living God When shall I come and
[30:32] appear before God my tears have been my
[30:34] meat day and night while they
[30:36] continually say unto me where is thy God
[30:40] Amen you may have your seats uh so we
[30:43] just we're going to be playing um a just
[30:45] a 20 minute portion as our pastor has uh
[30:49] desired and we uh Sunday morning we left
[30:52] off at paragraph 44 right at the end but
[30:55] we'll just go ahead and for context uh
[30:58] play paragraph 44 and end at
[31:02] 88 at the end of 88 and there's a lot of
[31:05] nuggets in there and so uh we'll just
[31:08] make a few comments at the end and uh
[31:11] remember that um our Pastor said that
[31:14] he's not leaving the thought of a path
[31:17] forward right so remember this this is
[31:20] this is the path forward and many things
[31:23] that he spoke about about unity and so
[31:27] um I was reminded of he read that uh
[31:30] quote later on in the message it says if
[31:32] you if you neglect to give the Holy
[31:34] Spirit the word of God you'll die so
[31:37] let's just remember some of these
[31:38] principles as we'll continue um to
[31:41] listen in in this sermon and just see
[31:43] what God has for us amen God bless you
[31:45] as we continue to
[31:51] listen see it's something
[31:54] natural it's not an unnatural thing to
[31:57] thirst for God it's a natural thing it's
[32:01] just something that you should do God
[32:03] has made you up like that and it's no
[32:06] superum it's just actually a common
[32:10] human being it ain't just special for
[32:12] some people they say well I've seen some
[32:14] people live such a a Victorious Life
[32:17] that they're constantly on the housetop
[32:19] they're praising God wish I could feel
[32:21] that way well the reason you're feeling
[32:23] that way it's a thirst in you and uh
[32:27] that's just a natural thing is for every
[32:29] person to thirst for God now we'll take
[32:32] some of the natural thirst is first
[32:34] let's take for instance thirsting for
[32:36] water as David said here U thirsting for
[32:39] of the water thirsting for water the
[32:41] body is in need of
[32:44] water and if you don't Supply that
[32:47] thirst you'll
[32:49] perish you'll dehydrate and you the you
[32:53] won't live if you can't get water to
[32:57] that thirst to quench that thirst of the
[33:00] Natural Body you will soon perish you
[33:03] won't live long you can live longer
[33:05] without food than you can without water
[33:08] because you can fast for 40 days Jesus
[33:12] did I suppose without without food but
[33:14] you couldn't do that long without water
[33:17] you would just simply dry up and die you
[33:19] must have water and if and The Thirst
[33:23] that comes on you well it's to show that
[33:26] the body is in need of something to keep
[33:29] it
[33:30] alive the body's got to have the water
[33:33] in order to stay alive you're 80
[33:37] something per uh water and petroleum
[33:39] anyhow and you've got to take these
[33:42] sources in to keep you alive as I've
[33:45] said if you neglect it you'll perish uh
[33:49] The Thirst also is an
[33:52] alarm it's an alarm clock that thirsting
[33:56] the soul set off alarm clock a little
[33:59] buzzer inside of you that tells you that
[34:03] death has lurking nigh that if you don't
[34:07] get water pretty soon you've got to die
[34:11] and it gets louder and louder until
[34:14] finally you keep putting it off and
[34:17] you'll die because it's alarm clock like
[34:20] David described it you're in the Psalms
[34:22] as a heart
[34:26] paintthe so so
[34:30] paintthe oh God as the heart paintthe
[34:36] water book I've often thought as reading
[34:40] of this of David David was a Woodsman a
[34:44] hunter and he hunted deer of course and
[34:48] many we in this day hunt them the heart
[34:51] is a deer and we find if you ever seen
[34:55] the dogs that wild dogs to grab a deer
[34:59] and usually they got like the coyote of
[35:01] fang and he can grab the deer right
[35:04] above the bir the ear here and swing his
[35:07] weight he cuts the throat of the deer
[35:09] and the deer doesn't have a chance then
[35:12] but sometimes the the the dog like in
[35:15] Africa there the Wild dog will grab the
[35:17] deer right in the flanks if he misses
[35:20] the throat he'll grab the second time at
[35:22] the flanks and if the deer is strong
[35:25] enough and quick enough he can shake the
[35:27] dog off the deer's much faster the dog
[35:30] stalks him when he's not looking and
[35:34] when he's up wind from him and and he uh
[35:36] he don't know the the dog is near and
[35:39] then when the Wild dog grabs him if he's
[35:41] real quick he can throw it off and but
[35:44] when the dog comes out of the flank he's
[35:46] got a whole mouthful of the deer's flesh
[35:49] or when he grabs at his neck sometime
[35:51] he'll cut close to the Jugger vein and
[35:53] miss it and the deer shaking will pull a
[35:56] whole chunk of meat out of the deer's
[35:59] throat then the blood begins to run and
[36:02] then the dog will come right on the
[36:04] trail of that blood after the deer and
[36:06] as the life of the deer begins to
[36:09] dwindle as the blood is which is the
[36:12] life stream to the body as that begins
[36:15] to dwindle down the deer gets weaker and
[36:18] the dog D or the wolf is right behind
[36:22] the deer now if that deer can't find
[36:26] water now water has something in it that
[36:30] when the deer drinks the water it stops
[36:32] the bleeding but if he don't get water
[36:35] to cool him off then the the blood keeps
[36:38] flowing out faster because he's running
[36:41] keeping his heart pumping but if he can
[36:43] ever get to water the deer will live now
[36:48] there's a great lesson there see and
[36:50] David's saying here as the heart
[36:54] paintthe water broke my soul old pth for
[36:59] thee oh God now that deer
[37:02] knows unless he finds water he's gone he
[37:07] just can't live I've tracked him many
[37:10] times after being wounded when he hits a
[37:12] stream of water he'll cross in and get a
[37:14] drink go up over the hill come back down
[37:16] cross get a drink of water and go up
[37:19] you'll never catch up with him as long
[37:21] as he'll follow that stream but once
[37:23] when he leaves the stream if he can't
[37:25] find another water Brook somewhere
[37:27] you'll catch him right away and now the
[37:29] deer knows that so he'll stay right with
[37:31] the water where he can get to it right
[37:33] quick now could you imagine a deer with
[37:37] his nose up he's been caught out
[37:39] somewhere where there's no water and he
[37:42] says as the heart uh thirst or pain is
[37:47] the thirst after the water Brooks my
[37:50] soul thirst after the oh God unless I
[37:54] can find you Lord I'll perish that's
[37:57] right I I I can't go unless I find you
[38:03] and when a man or a woman boy or girl
[38:06] gets that kind of a thirst for God he's
[38:09] going to find something see but when we
[38:12] come at it just kind of halfway well
[38:15] I'll kneel down and see what the Lord
[38:17] does see you're not really thirsting yet
[38:20] it's got to be a thirst between death
[38:22] and life and then something takes place
[38:26] the deer also here he's uh we find uh
[38:30] and he is also has another sense of
[38:33] smell that sets off alarm in him when
[38:36] his enemy is near he's possessed this
[38:40] little creature with a a sense to
[38:42] protecting C and he's uh he's got a
[38:46] little alarm in him a little something
[38:48] that he he tickles his nose when the
[38:51] enem is near you can get in the Wind of
[38:54] the enemy and he knows that you're there
[38:57] and he's gone sometimes a half a mile
[38:59] away he can smell you and get away or
[39:01] the wolf or any danger he's able to
[39:04] sense it because that he's made up that
[39:07] way he's a deer by nature and that sense
[39:12] in him is just one of the god giving
[39:16] senses to him to live by and I know I
[39:20] thought comparing the deer with a man
[39:23] that's thirsting for God before the
[39:25] enemy gets there there's something about
[39:28] a child of God that when you once are
[39:31] born into the spirit of God receive the
[39:34] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's
[39:36] something about the person that can
[39:38] sense the enemy you can take a man when
[39:41] he's taking the scripture and reading
[39:44] the scripture and trying to inject
[39:46] something to that scripture that's
[39:48] contrary to the scripture a man that's
[39:50] filled with the Holy Ghost can sense
[39:52] that right quick there's something out
[39:53] of the way when he gets into a place and
[39:57] and uh that little certain sense in
[40:00] there that uh it's done to protect your
[40:03] life you you mustn't uh you must never
[40:06] go for anything un L it's exactly the
[40:08] word of God you must stay right exactly
[40:11] with that word and now and we are uh uh
[40:16] secured with that sense as long as we're
[40:19] in the Holy Spirit you can go to read
[40:21] and like for instance somebody say now
[40:24] go to read Mark 16 and say and these
[40:26] signs shall follow them that believe in
[40:28] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[40:31] shall speak with new tongues or take up
[40:33] serpents or drink daily things it would
[40:35] not harm them if they lay their hands on
[40:37] the sick they shall recover now then you
[40:41] find a person get up there and say now
[40:43] that was for the apostolic age that now
[40:48] right quick if you have received the
[40:50] Holy Spirit you've been endowed with
[40:53] that
[40:54] sense that sets it off there's something
[40:56] wrong there that's right see if try to
[41:00] explain it way that's far another day
[41:02] that really you don't need those things
[41:05] today but Jesus said these signs shall
[41:10] follow them that
[41:11] believe there's a little something sets
[41:14] off in you a little buzzer and knowing
[41:17] that that's wrong and that's the way of
[41:19] death because Jesus said if we add one
[41:22] word to this or take one word from it
[41:25] our parts taken out of the Book of Life
[41:27] not one scripture we must take it just
[41:30] the way it's written and God watches
[41:33] over his word to perform it and we know
[41:35] that's it's got to be just right so
[41:37] therefore no matter what a church would
[41:40] say what anyone else would say if you're
[41:42] born of the spirit of God you become
[41:45] part of the Bible God told Ezekiel he
[41:49] the prophet he said take the scroll and
[41:51] eat it then the prophet and the scroll
[41:54] became part of each other and that's the
[41:57] believer when he receives the Holy
[41:59] Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible
[42:02] and the spirit of God is the word of God
[42:04] my words are Spirit In the Beginning was
[42:07] the word the word is with God and the
[42:09] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[42:11] and dwell Among Us Hebrews 138 is the
[42:13] same yesterday today and forever and
[42:16] when you are a part of that
[42:20] word oh then let something come up
[42:24] contrary to that word because the little
[42:26] buzzer sets off right quick see it's the
[42:28] warn you that death is in the road we
[42:32] should never do that there is the all
[42:35] these thirst are just natural they are
[42:38] natural for the Christian they are
[42:40] natural for the human being there is
[42:42] also a thirst for
[42:46] Success so many people today how we
[42:49] school for this thirst we just noticed
[42:51] the start of the University up and we go
[42:55] down there and people spend thousands of
[42:58] dollars to send her children to the
[43:00] school and and to universities and
[43:03] colleges and so forth to get an
[43:05] education to be successful they call it
[43:08] in
[43:09] life but now I have nothing against that
[43:13] that's all right but to me you could get
[43:15] all the schooling in the world and still
[43:17] you haven't found the right success
[43:20] that's right because that will just
[43:23] temporarily make uh things a little
[43:26] easier for you here and there's uh but
[43:28] when you die you leave all that behind
[43:32] you and this entire economy that we have
[43:37] I was saying the other day at Phoenix
[43:39] the stand quoting again that all this
[43:43] modern civilization the whole
[43:45] educational program the whole scientific
[43:47] program is all contrary to God's word
[43:51] and his
[43:52] will civilization is absolutely there'll
[43:56] never be civilization in the world that
[43:58] is to come like this one this is the
[44:00] perverted civilization God had his first
[44:03] civilization upon the earth when he
[44:06] spoke his words and they come up every
[44:07] seed of its kind and in that
[44:10] Civilization there was no death sickness
[44:12] sorrow and now we take the things that
[44:15] is in the scientific world that was put
[44:18] here to hold it together and pervert it
[44:20] into something and that brings death
[44:23] that's right like the atomic bomb I
[44:25] don't know the fers of these things but
[44:27] I might say this wrong it take uranium
[44:29] to split a a molecule and a molecule
[44:32] breaks an atom or what does it do that
[44:34] it just malates almost just
[44:37] destroys everything that we do we take
[44:39] medicine put this formuler with this
[44:42] formuler to cure this and put it into us
[44:44] and what do we do we tear down something
[44:47] else now I guess you read La read last
[44:50] month's reader digest that it said that
[44:53] in this age that we're living in now
[44:55] that young men and women women me reach
[44:58] middle age between 20 and 25 years
[45:01] old think of that little girls and
[45:05] menopause and 20 22 23 years old middle
[45:09] AG you see what's done it it's been this
[45:13] hybrid food and stuff we're eating see
[45:16] it's the stuff the food and the the life
[45:18] that we're living scientists has brought
[45:20] it to us and in doing so they're killing
[45:24] you as in Africa we're I see them boys
[45:27] that never had a dose of medicine in
[45:28] their life they eat uh meat that had
[45:31] maggots in it they drank out of a pool
[45:34] that it looked like would kill an ox and
[45:38] I was shooting a Target at 200 yards and
[45:40] I couldn't see it with a pair of 750
[45:42] binoc and a man my age is stand there
[45:44] tell me where I was hitting with his
[45:45] naked
[45:47] eye now if all this modern culture has
[45:50] done something I feel if I had his eyes
[45:52] in his stomach I'd be a pretty good man
[45:55] yeah but there you are see that's what
[45:58] Science Education civilization we're
[46:01] destroyed by it we destroy ourselves it
[46:04] started in the Garden of Eden and runs
[46:06] on for today but thirsting for
[46:11] Success man we thirst for Fellowship we
[46:15] go we want Fellowship it's like a young
[46:17] man and a young woman now it's not
[46:20] unnecessary or not I mean unnatural for
[46:23] a young man and a young woman to to love
[46:26] love one another it is a thirst for love
[46:29] it's her age and they they love one
[46:32] another and it's not unnatural that's
[46:34] it's a natural thing for him to do that
[46:37] now we find many things in the life that
[46:40] we live in the natural body that we
[46:43] thirst far it's just something sets in
[46:45] us we want to do it we absolutely feel
[46:48] that it's necessary and it is necessary
[46:51] that we do it we find many uh women u in
[46:54] these days uh uh thirst for View
[46:58] now there isn't a woman it's a natural
[46:59] thing for a woman to thirst to be pretty
[47:02] that's that's her god-given Instinct in
[47:05] her beauty that God give her for her
[47:07] mate and now we find out that women want
[47:11] to be that way why is it it's just
[47:14] because it's something God gave her it's
[47:17] not wrong for women to be pretty they
[47:19] should be and you know they are the only
[47:23] creature that that the female is
[47:26] prettier than the male it's in the human
[47:29] race every other animal take the the cow
[47:32] to the bull the do deer to the buff the
[47:35] hen to the rooster the motherb bird to
[47:37] the father bird always you find the male
[47:40] is big and pretty but on the human race
[47:43] show there where the perversion come it
[47:44] turns around and it's the women so it's
[47:47] it's pretty and they lust to be pretty
[47:50] not like some of these worried creatures
[47:52] we see on the street of this day no no
[47:54] not that kind of pretty
[47:57] that's a harvest looking side I ever
[47:58] seen in my life yes sir that is a
[48:01] perversion that's perverting the true
[48:04] thirst now the truth thirst that a woman
[48:07] should have would be to Adorn themselves
[48:09] in modest apparel and to have a
[48:11] Christlike Spirit 1 Timothy
[48:14] 2:9 now that's a way the woman should
[48:17] thirst to be now if you want to be
[48:19] pretty that's the way what makes you
[48:21] pretty see is a Christlike spirit andorn
[48:25] and modest apparal oh my some of these
[48:28] people today out on the streets you
[48:30] can't tell a man from the woman and it's
[48:32] a it's the most horrible looking thing
[48:34] it you I it's it's I I never seen
[48:37] anything like it like human beings it's
[48:40] beyond human eyes painted way up like
[48:42] that and you know them funny looking
[48:45] lizard eyes and all them funny looking
[48:49] clothes and well I don't even also out
[48:51] of farm that don't even look like a
[48:52] human being and some of them boys out
[48:54] here their hair combed down their
[48:56] sisters roarers in front here you know
[48:58] why it's a complete
[49:01] perversion that's right it's a it's a
[49:05] it's
[49:06] Satan and Satan is a
[49:09] perverter when God made everything in
[49:11] the Garden of Eden it was lovely then
[49:14] Satan come in and perverted Satan cannot
[49:16] create nothing there's only one Creator
[49:19] that's God but Satan perverts the
[49:22] original creation right and now he's got
[49:25] into this I want to speak tonight about
[49:27] perverting the the original creation of
[49:32] thirst now a woman as I said
[49:35] before wants to be pretty there's
[49:38] something in her that she's feminist and
[49:41] she wants to be that way but the way
[49:43] they are on the street today hair cut
[49:45] like a man wearing man's clothes and
[49:48] then man turn around wearing women's
[49:50] clothes and a haircut like a woman see
[49:52] it's a perversion the whole thing your
[49:54] food's perverted your life's perverted
[49:57] your thirst perverted your desires
[49:59] perverted it's a day of
[50:02] perversion speaking here not long go on
[50:05] Satan's Eden God took 6,000 years and
[50:08] made a perfect Eden Satan come over and
[50:11] sprayed them seeds and deformed him now
[50:13] he's got 6,000 years and he's got his
[50:15] own scientific
[50:17] Eden right back again on a perversion of
[50:21] the right and this is the age of high
[50:23] breeding High breeding they've even got
[50:26] the the church is to dat of their High
[50:28] bread that's right they get in here they
[50:31] just go to a church it's a lodge instead
[50:32] of a church a church is a place where
[50:35] people come together and worship God in
[50:37] spirit and in truth and today it's a
[50:40] lodge we go there and have a little kind
[50:42] to shake hands and fellowship with some
[50:44] black coffee in the back of the building
[50:46] and go home till next week we've done
[50:47] our religious
[50:48] Duty now it's a perverted age and Satan
[50:52] is perverting these thirst that God
[50:56] putting you to
[50:58] thirst Satan is perverting them now if
[51:02] you want to know the right perversion if
[51:04] you the women want to be pretty take
[51:06] first Timothy 2:9 that's how they
[51:08] adorning themselves in modest spirit
[51:10] with AO with a Christlike Spirit meet
[51:13] subject to their husbands and so forth
[51:15] that's the way that you should be
[51:16] adorned your life you live he perverts
[51:19] the true nature of God and the true
[51:22] thirst of God of the body and soul by
[51:25] lust for sin
[51:27] sin a perversion now we find out a
[51:31] person today the way they've took that
[51:33] perversion thirst for God The Thirst for
[51:37] to be pretty and all these thirst for
[51:40] for water they turn that into to
[51:42] satisfying that with drinking The Thirst
[51:46] for joy everybody wants to have joy
[51:49] thirst for Fellowship all these great
[51:52] thirst that God put into us that we
[51:54] might thirst after him
[51:57] God Made You to thirst after
[52:01] him and we try to satisfy it with some
[52:04] other kind of a thirst with some other
[52:07] kind of a perversion of the correct
[52:09] thirst see inter natural see that's in
[52:12] the spiritual we think as long as we
[52:15] draw church that's that's satis that's
[52:17] all we have to do well that is
[52:19] absolutely
[52:20] wrong no God wants you to thirst for him
[52:24] amen as the heart pain for the water
[52:27] Brook my soul thirst after thee Oh God
[52:31] see
[52:34] see amen praise the Lord what a
[52:37] wonderful word
[52:39] amen amen maybe by the help of God we'll
[52:41] just make a few comments on that um but
[52:45] I I like that just that last
[52:48] um um portion there
[52:52] um he says uh God wants you to thirst
[52:55] for him as the heart panth after the
[52:58] water Brook and right before that he
[53:00] says see how it's in the spiritual I'm
[53:04] backing up a little bit just that God
[53:06] Made You to thirst after him and we try
[53:09] to satisfy it with some other kind of
[53:12] thirst now I these are the words of
[53:17] God and many times I think there's a
[53:20] great danger if I could say it like this
[53:24] where um
[53:27] I I
[53:27] mean we just don't know how blessed we
[53:31] are we we have the voice of God and to
[53:35] have a revelation of that you have what
[53:39] everybody
[53:40] needs and what's unfortunate though it
[53:43] becomes common to us because we we pack
[53:46] it around in our pocket we we got it on
[53:49] devices and we allow the word of God to
[53:52] become so common in such a way where we
[53:57] don't take
[53:58] heed and then we kind of get to a place
[54:01] of complacency where he's no longer
[54:04] talking about us he's kind of talking
[54:06] about the world he's kind of talking
[54:09] about the denominations he's kind of
[54:11] talking about Pentecostalism because
[54:13] we've already arrived you know and and
[54:15] we we we thirst but we got the message
[54:18] no he's talking to
[54:19] me he's telling me as a Son of God
[54:22] because those that I love I rebuke and I
[54:24] chase and and he's trying to tell you my
[54:27] son I've created you to thirst but now
[54:31] watch he says but that thirst he said
[54:34] God Made You to thirst after him and we
[54:36] try to satisfy it with some other kind
[54:38] of thirst so he's telling me his son son
[54:41] if you're not
[54:43] careful right there's going to be the
[54:47] enemy is going to come in and and this
[54:48] flesh man is going to try to satisfy
[54:51] that thirst for God with things of the
[54:53] world with some other kind of perversion
[54:56] of some of the correct thirst see how
[54:59] it's in the
[55:00] natural so he laid it out there in the
[55:02] natural see how it's in the spiritual we
[55:06] think as long as we join
[55:08] church that settles it spiritual we
[55:13] think as long as we
[55:14] have an
[55:16] experience that settles it but remember
[55:20] he said I I if you don't Milk The Cow I
[55:23] thought that would be a if a great title
[55:25] for a sermon if you don't Milk The
[55:28] Cow what happens if you don't Milk The
[55:31] Cow it dries
[55:33] up right what happens if you don't drink
[55:37] water you die what happens if you don't
[55:41] give the Holy Ghost the
[55:43] word you
[55:46] die so we find out that that thirst in
[55:49] you is for
[55:51] what the word which is God that's what's
[55:55] going to sustain that's what's going to
[55:57] keep you and and the the beautiful thing
[55:59] about it is oh how the word ties
[56:01] together the the religious world was was
[56:04] in a Cess pool of denomination in broken
[56:09] sisters and that can't quench The
[56:12] Thirst but now what do we have we we
[56:15] have a fountain open in the House of
[56:17] David oh it's just flowing and flowing
[56:19] that you can come drink freely so we'll
[56:22] just try to um make a few comments we
[56:24] won't be long uh just to um Fellowship
[56:28] on these things but uh so let's just go
[56:31] back and we'll just kind of walk through
[56:33] um the some of the the quotes here in 44
[56:37] if they'll go ahead and bring that up as
[56:38] we'll just read that um and and just
[56:41] walk through some of these things
[56:43] together and just uh enjoy the word of
[56:46] God
[56:47] Amen so in 44 um he says see it's
[56:51] something natural it's not a an natural
[56:54] thing to thirst for God it's a natural
[56:56] thing it's just something that you
[56:58] should do God has made you up like that
[57:01] and it's no no superhuman it's just
[57:03] actually a common human being it's just
[57:05] it ain't just uh uh just special for
[57:07] some people they say well I I've I've
[57:09] seen some people live such Victorious
[57:12] lives that they're constantly on the
[57:14] housetop they're praising God wish I
[57:17] could feel that way well the reason you
[57:19] are feeling that
[57:23] way it's The Thirst in you right and
[57:27] it's just a natural thing it's for every
[57:31] person to thirst for God so when you
[57:35] when you see somebody maybe they're
[57:37] living in Victory and you see somebody
[57:40] that's praising God you you see these
[57:42] things happening and you want that that
[57:44] is a natural thing for you to want that
[57:47] because God put that in you and what is
[57:49] it it's a thirst for
[57:52] him you know you you he said thirst is
[57:55] an natural thing thirst for success is a
[57:58] natural thing so when you when you see
[58:00] uh the world and and Lady OA and and and
[58:04] you see them all uh uh winning their
[58:06] trophies and and becoming successful and
[58:09] and getting their championships and they
[58:12] they they won the championship I they
[58:15] they're Victorious you know there's
[58:17] there's a natural uh way of thirsting
[58:20] for Success thirsting uh for
[58:23] accomplishment thirsting uh uh to be
[58:25] successful wanting uh if you're not
[58:27] careful we we see uh people successful
[58:30] in life and we start to measure
[58:33] things out by what as our pastor was
[58:36] laying out there we start to measure
[58:37] things by what lady osia calls
[58:40] successful and if you start to see that
[58:43] there's a thirst in you that's natural
[58:45] God Made You to thirst but Satan comes
[58:47] along and he perverts that thirst for
[58:49] God for the things of the world and one
[58:52] thing that I found out there's nothing
[58:54] in this world that can ever
[58:56] satisfy the thirst for God that's
[59:01] right I tell you young people if if if
[59:04] you if you're growing up under a a home
[59:07] where your parents are applying the
[59:10] token and and it seems like there's
[59:12] things out there in the world that you
[59:14] want to try and and you want to do I
[59:16] want to tell you it's
[59:19] death it it might uh tickle the senses
[59:23] it might give you a rush it might give
[59:26] you an adrenaline rush but I want to
[59:28] tell you where it's leading you to is
[59:31] death because when lust is conceived it
[59:33] bringeth forth
[59:35] death you know that's that's the problem
[59:37] with with drug addicts and things like
[59:39] that they get a taste for it or if I can
[59:42] and or they get a thirst for it and it's
[59:44] this invigorating feeling they they feel
[59:47] all they feel good and and maybe the
[59:50] cares of this world and things oh
[59:51] they're not thinking about them anymore
[59:53] and and it gives them a temporary
[59:55] satisfaction
[59:56] action and then what does it do it
[59:58] creates a thirst for it and then they
[1:00:01] start thirsting for it and then they
[1:00:03] need more of it and the amount that
[1:00:06] satisfied them last time is not enough
[1:00:07] so they need more and more and more what
[1:00:09] it's just a
[1:00:12] perversion it in one it's a it's a
[1:00:14] natural thirst that's been perverted and
[1:00:17] what does de the devil want to do he
[1:00:19] wants to give you a
[1:00:20] substitute I I I'll just share this I I
[1:00:23] I I think it's quite profound um um it's
[1:00:26] just something that I noticed but I I
[1:00:28] noticed a lot of times when we go to
[1:00:30] youth camps and and and and we go places
[1:00:33] where we're having a a a meeting for the
[1:00:35] young people it's like whenever a young
[1:00:38] person finally has a wonderful
[1:00:39] experience in the Lord for some reason
[1:00:42] Mr Wright is right there I mean it just
[1:00:46] somehow magically I finally got
[1:00:48] experience with God I got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:50] and here's my
[1:00:52] husband it's a distraction
[1:00:56] he wants to be your husband he wants to
[1:00:59] lead you he wants to guide you he wants
[1:01:01] you to be excited about him but Satan
[1:01:02] wants to offer you an
[1:01:04] alternative and thankfully you know I I
[1:01:06] was a little bit older and a little bit
[1:01:08] wiser sure enough guess what happened
[1:01:10] when my wife got uh had an experience
[1:01:13] and and and God really came down and
[1:01:16] touched her life guess who is right
[1:01:19] there Mr
[1:01:22] wri I'm not Mr Wright but yeah her
[1:01:25] husband was was right there but I
[1:01:28] remember remember when when about the
[1:01:31] Holy Ghost it senses danger it know
[1:01:34] something something in me fortunately I
[1:01:36] I had a little bit uh God had taught me
[1:01:38] some things and I had seen some things
[1:01:40] and the Holy Ghost In Me said as much as
[1:01:43] I want to talk to
[1:01:45] you and I I think by now I don't have to
[1:01:47] tell you that there obviously was
[1:01:49] something in me that loved her I hope
[1:01:53] you know that cuz I married her
[1:01:56] so obviously I didn't even know how much
[1:01:58] I liked her at the time but I said as
[1:02:01] much as I I want to talk to you I said
[1:02:04] if you're here at this Camp next year
[1:02:07] I'll talk to you then because I want you
[1:02:09] to be able to grow in the Lord that was
[1:02:11] the Holy
[1:02:13] Ghost and I broke
[1:02:15] down and I knew she worked at a
[1:02:18] bakery and so I called every Bakery in
[1:02:20] Lima Ohio fortunately Lima is small and
[1:02:23] there was only three of them
[1:02:26] first one she went by Gabby no Gabby
[1:02:30] there second one no Gabby there third
[1:02:33] one is Gabby there yeah one moment she
[1:02:36] got on the phone and that Holy Ghost
[1:02:38] said you said you wouldn't talk to her
[1:02:39] for a year hello
[1:02:44] click that was the Holy Ghost because it
[1:02:48] there around that time God now was
[1:02:49] confirming the work in her life and
[1:02:51] filling her with the Holy Ghost and what
[1:02:52] would I have been a distraction
[1:02:58] right and so that's that's Satan always
[1:03:01] wants to offer a substitute and that's
[1:03:04] how Satan works it's it's not a bad
[1:03:07] thing I mean you'll finally be able to
[1:03:09] give to the church you'll finally be
[1:03:11] able to support missionaries and all you
[1:03:13] got to do is work on on Sunday just once
[1:03:15] in a
[1:03:16] while it might seem even like a good
[1:03:19] thing but remember we got to go back to
[1:03:21] the
[1:03:22] Bible right amen so we're thirsting for
[1:03:27] God Satan wants to offer you a
[1:03:29] substitute he wants to offer you
[1:03:31] something different he wants to be able
[1:03:34] to offer you the things of the world but
[1:03:36] as I was trying to say nothing in this
[1:03:38] world can ever satisfy the thirst for
[1:03:41] God I've often wondered you know is is
[1:03:44] is that potentially why Elon Musk and
[1:03:46] Bill Gates and all them are still
[1:03:49] working I'm sorry but if I had a net
[1:03:51] worth of some like I don't know
[1:03:55] what's what's the guy who made a bunch
[1:03:57] of money off of books
[1:03:59] online Jeff
[1:04:02] bezo I mean I don't know about you but
[1:04:05] if I had some $140 billion dollars I'd
[1:04:09] build a church for everybody in the
[1:04:11] message I'd buy maybe I'd just go buy
[1:04:13] some islands and we'd all go I don't
[1:04:15] know all I know is I wouldn't be
[1:04:18] working
[1:04:20] right but I I but but there's a
[1:04:22] something in that's thirsting for
[1:04:24] something
[1:04:26] you would think 20 billion would have
[1:04:29] been enough 40 billion would have 100
[1:04:31] billion would have been it's not
[1:04:34] enough so a new house ain't going to be
[1:04:36] enough a a better job's not going to be
[1:04:38] enough you know there's only one thing
[1:04:40] that's
[1:04:41] enough Hallelujah there's only one thing
[1:04:45] that's enough Saints and that is him and
[1:04:48] his word and that is enough and I want
[1:04:51] to say it's more than enough
[1:04:55] that's that thirst that's inside of you
[1:04:58] you're hungering you're thirsting for
[1:05:01] more it ain't going to be a boyfriend it
[1:05:03] ain't going to be a girlfriend it ain't
[1:05:04] going to be a new job it ain't going to
[1:05:06] be a career it ain't going to be a
[1:05:08] bigger house it ain't going to be a
[1:05:09] bigger car none of those things are ever
[1:05:11] going to satisfy The Thirst there's only
[1:05:13] one
[1:05:16] thing naturally and
[1:05:19] spiritually and for a predestinated Son
[1:05:22] of God religion ain't going to do it
[1:05:26] a partial truth ain't going to do it
[1:05:28] screaming and shouting ain't going to do
[1:05:30] it speaking in tongues ain't going to do
[1:05:32] it just a one-time experience ain't
[1:05:34] going to do it no it's going to have to
[1:05:36] be walking with
[1:05:38] Jehovah it's going to be having to come
[1:05:40] in behind the veil oh I love how the
[1:05:42] prophet of God says when you come in
[1:05:44] behind the veil and it drops down when
[1:05:46] you're in there it's
[1:05:48] soundproof it keeps all the world out
[1:05:52] all of the voices and all the
[1:05:53] substitutes that are trying to come in
[1:05:55] and say oh you need this and you need I
[1:05:57] can't hear
[1:05:58] you it's soundproof in
[1:06:01] here the only thing I can hear is the
[1:06:04] word I'm thirsty I'm thirsting for God
[1:06:07] Lord my heart panteth after thee not the
[1:06:10] things of the
[1:06:12] world but we let things come
[1:06:16] in why do you hunger why do you thirst
[1:06:20] Church he's wanting to reveal this great
[1:06:23] secret Revelation to you but we let so
[1:06:25] so many things take it out of you I
[1:06:27] believe that's in Christ The Mystery of
[1:06:29] God
[1:06:30] revealed same thing right you're
[1:06:32] thirsting you're
[1:06:34] hungering but we're allowing other
[1:06:36] things to come
[1:06:39] in in paragraph 87 that's where he said
[1:06:43] he said he
[1:06:44] perverts the true nature of God and the
[1:06:47] true thirst of God of the body and soul
[1:06:49] by lust for
[1:06:51] sin he he says there's a thirst for Joy
[1:06:55] there's a thirst thirst for
[1:06:56] Fellowship God put that in you that you
[1:06:59] would thirst after
[1:07:01] him that's that paragraph that he said
[1:07:03] he said God Made You to thirst after him
[1:07:05] and we try to satisfy it with some other
[1:07:07] kind of thirst with some other kind of
[1:07:09] perversion of the correct thirst see how
[1:07:11] it's in the natural see how it's in the
[1:07:13] spiritual we think as long as we join
[1:07:15] the church that settles it that's all we
[1:07:16] have to do no you got to keep
[1:07:19] feeding keep feeding the Holy Ghost the
[1:07:23] word cuz if you don't maybe you do
[1:07:25] something it goes out on a
[1:07:28] limb some of us just need to stop repent
[1:07:33] say
[1:07:34] Lord I'm wrong I need to get back in
[1:07:37] fellowship with you forgive me of my
[1:07:41] sins so many times people come for
[1:07:44] prayer and they they they they have a
[1:07:47] desire on their heart and what is it
[1:07:49] they're
[1:07:51] thirsting and and and they're they're
[1:07:53] they're they're they're wanting to have
[1:07:55] more more of this and more of that and
[1:07:56] sometimes you know it's
[1:08:00] just you know what to
[1:08:03] do you don't need a lightning bolt from
[1:08:06] God you know we know what we need to
[1:08:09] do you want to be successful get
[1:08:14] up that what the pastor
[1:08:16] said you want to be what what's the
[1:08:19] things that natural successful people do
[1:08:23] what was our pastor trying to point out
[1:08:25] those are the things if you want to be a
[1:08:27] successful Christian you need to do and
[1:08:30] so many times we know that we need to do
[1:08:33] we just don't do
[1:08:34] it remember God is not going to shove
[1:08:37] you through a pipe and pull you out on
[1:08:40] the other s side and say Well done my
[1:08:42] good and faithful servant no you're here
[1:08:45] for the test you're here for the trial
[1:08:48] you're here for the victory right what
[1:08:51] is character it's a victory well victory
[1:08:54] means you got to have something overcome
[1:08:56] so he's left things there for you now
[1:08:59] eternally he already took care of it all
[1:09:02] that's the rest that's the confidence in
[1:09:04] knowing that God already took care of
[1:09:06] that but now you we got a a mountain
[1:09:08] with Giants on it right but we got to be
[1:09:11] like Caleb hey man there's some Giants
[1:09:14] squatting on my Mountain who wants to go
[1:09:16] kick them off cuz if you don't come with
[1:09:18] me it doesn't matter I I'll just get all
[1:09:20] the joy for myself but if you want to go
[1:09:22] whoop some devils is there anybody that
[1:09:24] wants to go give the devil a black guy
[1:09:26] and some of these demons let's go put a
[1:09:27] herd on
[1:09:29] them what are you talking about brother
[1:09:31] I'm talking about being what God Made
[1:09:34] You God made you an overcomer you're
[1:09:38] going to have to have things overcome so
[1:09:39] what do we got to do we got to
[1:09:42] fight if the devil's taking your your
[1:09:44] prayer life let's get it
[1:09:46] back I'm taking it
[1:09:49] back what the prophet of God saying how
[1:09:51] can I overcome he said you take the word
[1:09:53] of God and you hit him with the word and
[1:09:54] if he don't move
[1:09:58] you say oh it didn't work I went up for
[1:10:01] prayer and I'm still feeling the same
[1:10:03] still got a
[1:10:06] headache you said by your stripes I'm
[1:10:08] Healed Lord and I got prayed for I guess
[1:10:10] it's my lot in life
[1:10:14] no you take the word and you hit them
[1:10:16] again and if you still got the headache
[1:10:19] you hit them again if God give you a
[1:10:21] promise and you're believing for
[1:10:22] something I don't care if it's been one
[1:10:24] year five year 20 years if it's the word
[1:10:27] of God that it's the same word that was
[1:10:29] given to Abraham you tell that Old Devil
[1:10:31] I'm going to have the promise of God in
[1:10:34] my life and God said by his stripes I'm
[1:10:36] Healed hit him again take that devil I
[1:10:39] don't feel any better but by his stripes
[1:10:41] I'm Healed he said if you lay hands on
[1:10:43] the sick they shall recover hit them
[1:10:45] again hit them again hit them again some
[1:10:48] of you just get to
[1:10:51] wacking you're thirsting for something
[1:10:54] get to fight
[1:10:57] in God Made You to
[1:11:05] thirst so just continuing on here like I
[1:11:08] said we ain't going to try to be long
[1:11:11] but just uh I guess brother brandham
[1:11:14] comes through paragraph 46 and he starts
[1:11:17] to talk about how if you don't satisfy
[1:11:19] the natural thirst you'll
[1:11:21] die so we see that great uh natural type
[1:11:25] here in the spiritual that I I if you
[1:11:27] don't satisfy that thirst for God you're
[1:11:29] you're going to die just like the not
[1:11:32] milking the cow not feeding the Holy
[1:11:34] Ghost the word the things are uh if you
[1:11:36] neglect it it's it's going to the word
[1:11:38] of God if you neglect to give the Holy
[1:11:39] Spirit the word of God you'll die so
[1:11:41] just picking up in 47 we'll find a place
[1:11:44] uh uh to to just look for a close and 47
[1:11:48] he says The Thirst also I like this is
[1:11:52] an
[1:11:53] alarm it's an alarm alarm
[1:11:57] clock that
[1:12:01] thirsting no and and I I would say this
[1:12:04] if you're not
[1:12:05] careful if if Satan's been able to trick
[1:12:10] you that when the alarm clock starts
[1:12:13] going off you're reaching for the wrong
[1:12:15] thing to satisfy your
[1:12:17] thirst you know uh brother brandom says
[1:12:19] that in paragraph 91 he says he says and

[1:16:48] word you know what happens if you don't
[1:16:51] throw Another Log on the Fire
[1:16:57] what happens
[1:16:59] Church the fire goes
[1:17:02] out that's in the natural the prophet's
[1:17:06] telling you the reason you're going
[1:17:10] through what you're going through all
[1:17:12] you got to do Throw Another Log on the
[1:17:16] Fire and sometimes we go through
[1:17:19] seasons and you don't feel the joy you
[1:17:22] don't feel the love you feel all alone
[1:17:25] it's part of your character being built
[1:17:28] up and in that time what do you
[1:17:32] do look feeding the Holy Ghost the word
[1:17:35] has nothing to do with your
[1:17:38] emotions I I'll never I'll never forget
[1:17:40] one time brother Tim puit told me we
[1:17:43] were just having some fellowship some
[1:17:45] many years ago maybe 24 or 25 years ago
[1:17:49] I just and this phas what he told me
[1:17:51] just stuck with him me I'll never forget
[1:17:52] he said some he said brother Matthew you
[1:17:54] know sometimes you have to force feed
[1:17:58] yourself and you know I I I probably
[1:18:02] thought I knew what he
[1:18:03] meant you know I was young just starting
[1:18:06] to serve the Lord you know I thought
[1:18:08] yeah yeah you got to force feed yourself
[1:18:09] sure yeah I'm going to put that all down
[1:18:12] wait till you get to a
[1:18:15] place where you you feel like you can't
[1:18:18] go another step you feel like you can't
[1:18:20] do another thing and you feel like look
[1:18:23] I'm sorry we get this you feel like you
[1:18:24] don't even want to hear the word you
[1:18:26] feel like I don't why I don't want
[1:18:29] people to even try to encourage me
[1:18:30] you're just you feel so despondent
[1:18:32] you're so at a time and and people try
[1:18:34] to help and they're not helping they're
[1:18:35] making it
[1:18:38] worse you know what you got to do Throw
[1:18:41] Another Log on the
[1:18:43] Fire just because you don't feel like
[1:18:45] the fire's growing just because you
[1:18:46] don't feel like something's changing you
[1:18:48] just be obedient to the word Lord you
[1:18:50] said Lord I'm gonna get into your Bible
[1:18:53] I'm gonna put on another another sermon
[1:18:56] I'm going to listen to your word Lord
[1:18:58] because you said and that's how you
[1:19:00] continue the fight you keep feeding the
[1:19:01] Holy Ghost so this alarm clock that goes
[1:19:04] off he says in 47 oh my we're over time
[1:19:08] musicians go ahead and come that'll make
[1:19:10] me
[1:19:11] quit I didn't want to take too much time
[1:19:14] tonight we just trying to have a little
[1:19:15] fellowship and fill in for our pastor he
[1:19:18] says just come and then we'll see we'll
[1:19:21] see when we start
[1:19:22] playing I don't mean to hang y'all out
[1:19:24] like that but 47 he says The Thirst also
[1:19:28] is an alarm it's an alarm clock that
[1:19:31] thirsting the soul sets off the alarm
[1:19:33] clock a little buzzer inside of you that
[1:19:34] tells you that death has is lurking nigh
[1:19:37] if you don't get water pretty soon you
[1:19:40] you've got to die and it's louder and
[1:19:42] louder until finally you keep putting it
[1:19:44] off and you'll die because it's an alarm
[1:19:45] clock like David described here in
[1:19:47] Psalms as the heart panth after the
[1:19:49] water Brook so my soul panteth after
[1:19:51] thee Oh God as the heart panteth after
[1:19:53] the water Brook remember brother brandom
[1:19:55] as he starts the sermon he refers to
[1:19:57] when he preached thirsting for life and
[1:19:59] he says I looked up what the definition
[1:20:01] of thirst was and he said it was a
[1:20:03] painful
[1:20:05] desire right it's something that that
[1:20:08] that that has an effect it's it's a
[1:20:10] painful desire when you want something
[1:20:12] so bad until it becomes painful to you
[1:20:17] it's an alarm like the flashing red
[1:20:19] lights of the sign of his coming
[1:20:21] something's trying to get your attention
[1:20:24] say something's
[1:20:28] happening it gets louder and louder
[1:20:30] until finally you keep putting it off
[1:20:32] and you'll die because it's an alarm
[1:20:34] clock look alarms should be
[1:20:41] alarming if you have an alarm clock that
[1:20:43] doesn't wake you up or you sleep through
[1:20:45] it that's really not an alarm
[1:20:50] clock it's a I don't know making you
[1:20:53] feel better that you set your alarm
[1:20:55] clock but you're really not getting up
[1:20:56] on
[1:20:57] time an alarm
[1:21:00] clock should be so
[1:21:02] alarming it wakes you up it's painful
[1:21:05] like my
[1:21:06] goodness shut that thing
[1:21:11] off the problem is is we got a snooze
[1:21:14] button so then what do we do we put it
[1:21:16] on the other side of the room like man I
[1:21:18] can't miss this appointment I got to get
[1:21:20] up I'm going to go put my alarm clock on
[1:21:22] the other side of the room because I've
[1:21:23] gotten in a bad habit a hitting
[1:21:25] snooze quit hitting snooze Church get
[1:21:29] up you want to be successful get up
[1:21:32] early quit measuring your success by
[1:21:35] ladyo and the things of the world look
[1:21:37] into the
[1:21:38] Bible you want to know how to be
[1:21:40] successful look into the
[1:21:44] Bible we see what lady oia calls
[1:21:48] successful
[1:21:49] right fashion and cars and glamour and
[1:21:54] now I'm not in tune to it but you want
[1:21:57] to know the new success these days is
[1:22:00] it's Tik Tock and Instagram and
[1:22:03] everybody's uh presenting their fake
[1:22:07] lives you know and and disfiguring
[1:22:10] themselves and got all these things to
[1:22:12] make them look like it's it's not and
[1:22:15] what does it do it's it's creating a
[1:22:17] thirst a perverted thirst and people oh
[1:22:19] I like that and I like this and and I
[1:22:21] want to be like that can I do that can I
[1:22:23] make my eyelashes look like like that
[1:22:24] can I do this and that and it's a thirst
[1:22:27] brother Brandon went through all those
[1:22:29] things but it's a perverted
[1:22:31] thirst but I say I want to I want to be
[1:22:34] successful but I want to be a successful
[1:22:36] Christian so let's quit looking at lady
[1:22:39] oia to see what successful is let's look
[1:22:41] into our Bible I tell you what you want
[1:22:44] to talk about being
[1:22:46] successful think about being
[1:22:51] predestinated that's pretty successful
[1:22:56] look into your Bible you're
[1:22:57] predestinated you're more than a
[1:23:00] conqueror come on hey we're we're
[1:23:02] closing we're getting out of
[1:23:05] here our Pastor said quit measuring your
[1:23:08] success by Lady oia let's start looking
[1:23:11] into the word of God let's start doing
[1:23:13] the things that naturally are in us to
[1:23:15] be successful and let's do it for the
[1:23:18] word let's do it for the Lord let's look
[1:23:22] into our Bibles quit measuring the
[1:23:23] success by the world and start saying
[1:23:25] you know what Lord you said I'm
[1:23:26] predestinated you said I'm more than a
[1:23:28] conqueror you said I can do the Greater
[1:23:31] Works look into the message the message
[1:23:33] says you're Justified you never did it
[1:23:35] in the first
[1:23:36] place and I I got a little bit excited
[1:23:39] about this I was thinking about being
[1:23:40] successful you want to know the what I
[1:23:42] think the Pinnacle of success is is
[1:23:44] going in a
[1:23:47] Rapture if the world can get excited
[1:23:50] about all of their stuff out there and
[1:23:53] you know successful people people like
[1:23:54] to show it
[1:23:56] off you know at the end of the
[1:23:58] championship the MVP gets up there and
[1:24:01] he raises it up and says I'm a
[1:24:04] champion I'm the
[1:24:06] MVP I say there ought to be a bride of
[1:24:09] Christ through humility and a glow of
[1:24:11] the Holy Ghost you're showing the
[1:24:14] token I'm going in a Rapture I'm going
[1:24:17] to wear my hair long and my dresses long
[1:24:19] and I'm going to let the world know that
[1:24:21] I can't be bought by the things of ladyo
[1:24:24] because I've already been bought with a
[1:24:26] price by the blood of almighty God and
[1:24:28] I'm not looking to Lady OA for the
[1:24:30] things of My Success I am thirsting for
[1:24:33] something else beyond what lady OA can
[1:24:35] give me I'm thirsting for the one and
[1:24:37] true God and the one and true God has
[1:24:39] come in this generation and he has
[1:24:41] opened up the book he has revealed
[1:24:44] himself to the bride and oh we behold
[1:24:46] his face and say that's what I'm
[1:24:48] thirsting
[1:24:51] for don't let the devil trade
[1:24:55] that Holy thirst go ahead and play
[1:24:58] something we'll just go ahead and
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:06] stand don't let
[1:25:12] Satan
[1:25:15] substitute and pervert that Holy thirst
[1:25:18] for the things of the
[1:25:21] world brother brandham goes on to say
[1:25:23] talking about David he was a a Woodsman
[1:25:25] and he would he would see those deer as
[1:25:27] those wolves or those uh uh uh the
[1:25:30] animals would come after the deer they
[1:25:33] would wound the deer and it would get
[1:25:34] hurt and it would it would start to run
[1:25:37] and if it would start to bleed out that
[1:25:38] deer knew it had an instinct in them I
[1:25:42] got to get to
[1:25:46] water something in them there was a
[1:25:48] thirst and I got to get to water because
[1:25:51] if it doesn't get to water what's going
[1:25:52] to happen it's going going to
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:56] die and he said now if that deer can't
[1:25:59] find
[1:26:01] water no water now water has something
[1:26:04] in it when the deer drinks the water it
[1:26:06] stops the bleeding oh somebody here
[1:26:08] you're bleeding you're
[1:26:11] hurting you've been wounded and you've
[1:26:13] been
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:17] Runing but if it don't get water to cool
[1:26:19] them off the blood keeps flowing out
[1:26:21] faster because he's running keeping his
[1:26:24] heart pumping but if you can ever get to
[1:26:25] that water the deer will live now
[1:26:29] there's a great lesson see David's
[1:26:31] saying here as the heart panth for water
[1:26:33] Brook my soul panteth after thee oh
[1:26:36] god oh Hallelujah there's a thirst in
[1:26:40] you I've got to get to
[1:26:43] water there's an alarm clock going off I
[1:26:46] got to get to
[1:26:48] water and I like how he says that and
[1:26:51] the deer knows if it gets to that water
[1:26:55] if it crosses out and doesn't find any
[1:26:57] more water it'll die so it stays close
[1:26:58] to the
[1:27:00] water I say Lord I I want to stay close
[1:27:03] to you I want to stay close to the
[1:27:08] water 5070 says as the heart thirst and
[1:27:11] pant after the water broks my soul
[1:27:13] thirst after thee Oh God unless I can
[1:27:17] find you Lord I'll perish I can't go
[1:27:20] unless I find you and when a man or
[1:27:22] woman or a boy gets that kind of thirst
[1:27:24] for God he is going to find something
[1:27:27] see but when we come at it just kind of
[1:27:31] halfway well I'll kneel down and see
[1:27:33] what the Lord does see you're not really
[1:27:35] thirsting it's got to be a thirst
[1:27:37] between death and life and then
[1:27:40] something takes
[1:27:42] place maybe if God could use this
[1:27:45] portion of the
[1:27:47] service and you can open up your heart
[1:27:49] maybe the Lord's talking to you
[1:27:51] tonight maybe you've been halfway
[1:27:57] maybe you've been a little like ananas
[1:27:59] and
[1:28:02] saf you've kind of had one foot in and
[1:28:04] one foot out kind of had a little backup
[1:28:08] plan kind of one foot out in the things
[1:28:11] of the world and business and one foot
[1:28:13] in the word of
[1:28:16] God that that's that's not what the
[1:28:19] messenger's talking
[1:28:23] about you got to come to a place where
[1:28:25] you say you know what I'm all
[1:28:29] in you got to get desperate like buddy
[1:28:32] Robinson I believe it was he said
[1:28:35] Lord if you don't come
[1:28:39] tonight when you come back to earth
[1:28:41] again you're going to find a pile of
[1:28:42] bones right here oh now we're talking
[1:28:46] about
[1:28:47] thirsting between life and
[1:28:49] death I say let's allow God to come
[1:28:54] let
[1:28:56] him Quench and start to satisfy that
[1:29:01] thirst let them start to deal with your
[1:29:03] heart now as we end the
[1:29:05] service you know if the things that
[1:29:07] you've been doing ain't right and you've
[1:29:09] been feeding on the things of the world
[1:29:10] and you've been allowing things to come
[1:29:13] and take your time
[1:29:15] and you realize that
[1:29:19] Lord I've allowed Satan to pervert that
[1:29:21] thirst for you with other things maybe
[1:29:24] with every head
[1:29:29] bowed maybe somebody here just wants to
[1:29:33] lift their hand to him and say Lord I I
[1:29:35] feel like that I I
[1:29:36] haven't I've allowed my channels to get
[1:29:39] clogged and I've
[1:29:40] allowed my thirst to be perverted for
[1:29:43] the things of the
[1:29:44] world just hands around the
[1:29:48] building Lord I include myself
[1:29:52] Lord you've given us a a thirst for you
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:58] lord lord I just want to thank you for
[1:30:01] that
[1:30:03] Lord cuz where the world's groping in
[1:30:05] darkness and they're trying to satisfy
[1:30:07] that thirst with the things of the
[1:30:11] world you come our way
[1:30:15] Lord just like that woman at the well I
[1:30:19] she was she was thirsting
[1:30:22] and she just couldn't get it
[1:30:25] right maybe she thought another husband
[1:30:28] would would satisfy
[1:30:31] him that didn't work and the next one
[1:30:33] didn't work
[1:30:36] and but oh she was a predestinated seed
[1:30:39] something in her was hungering and
[1:30:44] thirsting and then you said those great
[1:30:46] words Lord I have needs to go by
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:51] Samaria when you came Lord
[1:30:55] you said
[1:30:57] if if you knew the gift of God and who
[1:30:59] it was that spoke to
[1:31:03] you you would ask me for a drink and I
[1:31:06] would give
[1:31:07] you Living
[1:31:09] Waters Lord I like her
[1:31:12] response she said give me this water
[1:31:16] that I thirst not
[1:31:18] again Lord that's the water we want
[1:31:20] tonight
[1:31:24] we ask that you forgive us Lord for
[1:31:26] allowing the things of the world to come
[1:31:29] in and the devil to allow our thirst to
[1:31:33] get satisfied by the things of the world
[1:31:35] but Lord we're going to move those out
[1:31:36] of the way now it doesn't take some big
[1:31:40] great exercise it just takes a a simple
[1:31:42] humble heart in humility to say
[1:31:46] Lord I know I'm wrong
[1:31:49] and I ask that you forgive me Lord I I
[1:31:52] didn't want to do it
[1:31:55] I I really want to serve you with all of
[1:31:57] my heart and I
[1:31:59] just I seem not to be able to make the
[1:32:01] right decisions and
[1:32:03] I somehow find myself doing things that
[1:32:06] I don't even want to do
[1:32:08] and I can say like Paul when I would do
[1:32:11] good evil is present with
[1:32:13] me Lord I'm just asking you to come once
[1:32:16] again and just forgive me
[1:32:18] God restore me build me back up Lord I'm
[1:32:22] going to start feeding the
[1:32:24] fire and start feeding the Holy Ghost
[1:32:27] the word of God and build my faith back
[1:32:30] up to know that I can do the Greater
