morning amen am man you may turn around and welcome someone as you invite brother been for our Psalm rating this morning God bless you you know as I was uh going throughout the week this past week and uh just what brother Tom had ministered about on Sunday really it really hit home for me the especially speaking of the way you know the path there you know it's in you to know the city placed in you knows you may not know just yet but you the Revelation coming and uh it's it just it made it stand out to me when brother brandham speaks and says that if you have eternal life you've always had eternal life you know that's that's just a something that really struck so I was diving into that sermon that day on Calvary and uh a quote that really stood out to me brother brandham says in paragraph 141 have your day at Calvary God will have his way with you and he says let me quote that again to emphasize have your day at Calvary God will have his way with you and sometimes we we look at our our mistakes our faults where we fall short and it's easy when we look at it that way legalistically you you're not going to find a a solution that you like because the wages of sin is death so anytime you you find yourself in a in a condition where you feel ashamed or disappointed in yourself brother Brandon wants to point out to you that it's it's what he did at Calvary when you just when you accept that then God can finally start using you just accepting that you know all this my sins my fs and mistakes they were settled there there the sin question was erased then you know that brought me to Psalm 27 the scripture says hear oh Lord when I cry in in verse 7 with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou sest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek that's right hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help how many can attest to Christ being your helper leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation and that you know that's I believe that's each and every single one of our cries each and every single one of our cries when we have need of something is I always asking the Lord and say Lord don't leave me here don't leave me in this condition I believe if you're a seed and you make that cry there's always a response he doesn't leave you alone he doesn't let you dwell now this the response may not come in the time that you'd like it to come but it's on its way so if you would read with me Psalm 27 we'll start with verse one the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host should against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord hear oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou sest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou Hast been my leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen against me and such as breathe out cruelty I have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord God bless you me have your seats amen years I

praise God for his blood that's been made available for us Amen brother the clever especially if you can come at this [Music] time God bless you I um I enjoy the message that brother Paul preached and in the uh sermon that he referred to there's a quote in there that just kind of gave me the inspiration for this song it's um paragraph 156 it says what is crucified with Christ is to live for others what kind of others those who hate you those who wouldn't like you those who who would make fun of you live for them be with them love them pray for those who despitefully use you say all manner of evil falsely for my name's sake they persecuted the prophets which was before you so I hope um this song is a blessing to [Music] you when I look back on what I thought was living I'm amazed at the price I chose to pay and to think I ignored what really matter cuz I thought the sacrifice would be too great when I finally reach the point point of giving in I found the cross was calling even then even though it took time to survive I've never found so much Al love for I am crucified with Christ and yet I live not I but Christ that lives within me his cross will never ask for more than I can give for it's not my strength but he is there's no greater sacrifice for I am crucified with Christ and yet I live as I hear the Savior call for daily dying [Music] I will bow beneath the weight of [Music] calary let my hand surrender to his piercing purpose the holds Me to the Cross and sets me free I will glory in the power power of the cross the things I thought were gain I count as [Music] lost with the sering I [Laughter] identify and by his resurrection power I'm [Music] alive for I am crucified with Christ and yet I live not I but Christ that lives within me his cross will never ask for more than I can give for it's not my strength but he is there's no greater sacrifice for I am crucified with Christ and yet I [Music] live amen we want his life to become our life amen who've taken our life and laid down and and died with him and resurrected with him and we have a some request up here brother uh uh please pray for brother uh Jeff and KU for an unspoken request he'd like to be remembered for brother Joel vill writes please pray for for Ashley and her son Junior has said that for healing in their bodies it said they wanted to be to come to church and pray that the Lord

morning amen Amen Brother John and chasty writ um is asking prayer for my son chase that he would recognize God's hand in his life and and become stronger through the test and the trials that he's

in the precious name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles let's turn to some scriptures this morning I'm going to try to make 45 minutes this morning if I can uh I guess this is the first time they been back in three or four weeks um you know whatever this is that's going around you know I had some infection in my lungs and and uh um I still have a little cough but I can if I kind of talk monotone and don't get too excited I I'm okay if I get excited then I start to cough you know and uh there's a lot of times I like to get excited so I'm going to try to uh stay mellow amen so if I start to get excited you guys just say taper taper and we'll try to taper let's read a real familiar scripture this morning let's turn in the Book of Malachi the fourth chapter and the fifth verse and then we're going to turn to the um Jude letter of Jude beloved he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and then let's turn over to Jude and it says in Jude and there's just one chapter of Jude so we'll call it chapter one it says beloved when I gave all diligence to write un to you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exort exort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints Amen Let Us bow our heads this morning Father we ask you to bless your word in jesus' name we pray amen man you may be seated we just came out of I I feel a wonderful meeting how many enjoyed the meeting and amen it just seemed like the Lord was speaking to us as a body of Believers and the theme of our meetings and I felt all the brothers just came right along the theme even brother Tom said I I had this scripture on my heart before uh brother McGary ever read read it or ever mentioned it and so I I felt it was a real confirmation of the Lord and I I I feel the Lord is uh wanting us to examine and to look at the way that we're going uh and not only as a church but as an individual you know what path am I on where am I going uh what is my objective what is the outcome of what that I'm doing uh you know what's what's the result uh going to be of of the a course that I've chosen or the actions that I'm having what is the end of it and and uh so A A wise man does that the scripture tells us that when a man starts a building that he counts his stones and he makes sure that he can finish it that he won't end up in a Folly uh if he's going to go into a battle he counts his troops and he counts uh what strength that he has and he makes a decision uh can I overcome this Foe and if he feels he can't overcome that foe then he uh sends out a a Envoy to make a peace offering uh and to uh say uh you know let us let us not lose men let us come to some a formulable uh agreement that that benefits us both that we might live in peace and let us resolve our differences and uh we we certainly uh we certainly don't negotiate with the devil but this was a uh a parable to have man examine himself if you go back and read the uh Parable it's to speak to us what way are we traveling and so that's what we uh have inspired my my heart and the path that uh what's on my heart to share with you and to uh stir up our Pure minds of way of remembrance of what it is that we want to be as a body of Believers what do we want to stand for uh what what it is that we want to represent and it came on my heart this little subject and and we're here to preach this morning I know that uh I I guess we they call it live stream or we uh uh we uh store it up what do they call that when you store something archive yeah it sounds like a tomb doesn't it but uh uh you know we archive things but uh really we're we're not here to preach to any other body and not any other place we're not here to Pastor people outside of our group in our ministry we're just here for the challenges that we face in the place that God has put us so we're we're not ministering today to be the a voice of the message throughout the land to be the uh interpreter of what uh the messenger said uh you know this is what he meant and this is our doctrines and and this is what we believe and and I'll tell you this is what he said and this is what he meant uh I have a simple thing he meant what he said and he said what he said and that can't be changed and God builds his church on Revelation not explanation and so that's what we arrest him but this thought came on my heart and I and it's uh today to uh get us to step back a moment and to think if I could use that and to consider our fathers and the faith of the early church and and realizing so I I've given this thought a title without Bible without books without tapes the Faith of Our Fathers now I want you to think about that for a moment how the church was built and what the church possessed when they didn't have Bibles they didn't have books and they didn't have tapes so they must have had something so we understand that as the church coming up from the ground because we know the church was planted in the ground unless a seed uh get be planted in the ground it shall not bloom it shall not produce fruit so we understand and we could go into this a lot deeper we'll just try to go a little bit but we know the first church was established at the day of Pentecost that's right and we realize that they were commissioned or they were told that Jesus uh told them to go into the upper room and you Terry there and wait until you are endued with power from on high cuz he told them I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again unto you and I'll be with you even in you till the end and the work works that I do shall you do also right and so that's what he told them so they they uh they uh saw that uh all of a sudden all this great Lord in Ministry they followed all of a sudden in a heartbeat was captured imprisoned beaten mocked in other words like he was nothing like he was just another common criminal that all his movement was didn't even compare to the power of Rome just the mighty political power just walked right in and said we're done with this guy we're done hearing about him Caesar is the almighty uh we rule this place and they just snatched him up they brought him before for uh uh Herod and Herod couldn't do anything with them so he sent him over to pilate and pilate said this guy's not done nothing I don't care he's just another fanatic as far as I'm concerned and they said crucify him he said sure go ahead crucify him we don't care he's nothing to us and all of a sudden there all what they thought became not so if they had an intellectual conception they said to them many times we thought that you'd be the one that restored Israel uh we thought you were him uh uh whatever their political Ambitions were whatever their what they that they thought their position was in what was going on as being disciples and being a part of this great uh uh seemingly movement all of a sudden V vanished because he didn't want it built on that he never wanted the church built on intellect so they went and they were endued with power from on high and they were given a commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel so we realize that the church was built on a commission you understand that now we know it was built on Revelation but the it was built on God carrying out what that he said and standing with his church so I'm going to read something in a moment so understand that the church was established and it went into the ground and so what happened to the church is the first thing the church lost was the spirit and it lost the spirit when nicadan ISM came in and if you go to read Jude just a little farther he says men have come in and their spots and wrinkles amongst our Feast they desire to have the preeminence among you and the individual leadership of the Holy Spirit was lost and uh uh men begin to insert themselves in between the believer and the word of God as interpreters and so the first thing the church lost was the leadership of the Holy Spirit the second thing the church lost was sanctification and we we understand that all of a sudden sanctification was replaced with rituals and uh uh ceremonies and a piety and and uh and and so there was no there was no longer a a necessity to keep one self separated from the world so to be separated didn't mean anything to be a peculiar people to have a a a holy life that begin to vanish from the church so they lost sanctification in other words they didn't put their effort into applying the token they put their effort into making sure they were at Mass to make sure that they said their their prayers that they had a prayer book because they already lost the leadership of the Holy Spirit now now they were they were losing the the part of their experience that watched what they they partook in you know that that didn't walk uh how can two walk together unless they agree so that began to leave the church and finally what left the church was justification so they lost the spirit they lost sanctification and they lost justification in other words now they were doing penants now they were lighting candles now they felt that they had to do something for their sins and so they were so separated from Calvary y that now they were they had a religious life and that whole life went into what is referred to as the Dark Ages the dark ages of the church they were ruled by nicoladis that all they their only access to God was was through uh Ministry and and ceremonies and and all kinds of religious rights and they felt if they did something wrong they had to go confess it and then go do something for that sin that was a condition of the church when it went into the ground in other words it was so far away from the original life that it was buried but now we know that God promised to re store amen so we we we we can follow the history of the church that the church went into the ground so the church lost the spirit lost sanctification and lost justification and went into the ground so if it's going to go back to its original it has to go back and start getting what it lost amen the first thing it's got to claim was the last thing it lost so the church had to claim justification they had to come back and say wait a minute the blood of Jesus Christ is what saved me that's right that's right I don't there's nothing I can do to repay my sins he paid it all and the church would never grow until it EST establish justification a Christian will never grow as long as it carries the guilt of its sin if you sit there and you're ashamed of what you did and you're ashamed of all good that's good that shame that conviction that feeling is given and put onto you to do one thing to drive you to repentance that's yes to so so that you can go there and say I'm sorry and then the word of God says if you're sorry and you're just to repent of your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you and he takes that from you and throws it in the sea of forgetfulness I know a lot of people come to it myself included we like something that we're doing and we we don't like the results we don't like how it makes it feel but we we don't want to get rid of it and when we go to repent of it we're in that mind battle to let go of it and instead of being justified we start to justify and we're just not ready to die out and let go and you know what you know what you know what happens with sin right finally the conviction and the ugliness of sin isn't worth and compared to the pleasure of the sin and finally you say the way this makes me feel I hate it I I don't want to do it and it drives you to the Lord to say Lord I'm sorry take this from me I'm sorry forgive me and he's just and faithful and says okay I'll take that off your record and then he's got to go back so we know he did that through the message of Luther and then he's got to go take the believer and establish once again with the believer the separation from from the world you just you can't go out and water your plant with motor oil you know it don't work you know what I mean you can't you you can't take your life and put it in Dark Places right and expect it to grow right so you've got to sanctify your life sanctify uh your in environment in other words there's a separation come out from amongst them and be ye separate so we understand that this process in The Believer he's got to come to realize okay God's forgiven me of my sins I'm no longer going to walk in sin I'm not going to walk after the flesh but I'm going to walk after the spirit I'm going to walk in the newness of Life yes so there I I I'm not going to partake of things that send me back into the process of guilt and shame so that's what he had to restore next so the last thing he's got to restore is the first thing the church lost for you understand what I'm trying to point to this morning is that we're on the reverse Journey okay so where we're at is we've we've been Justified we've been Sanctified we've been the spirit has been restored to us now we're moving back to that Faith of Our Father back to that church so I want I want each of you to think and place yourself back in that day where they didn't have a Bible how many knows that they didn't have a Bible now I'm not preaching this morning to get rid of your Bibles right we needed the Bible we needed the books we needed the tapes because we were so far away from the truth right that nobody had it there was no no resource no connection no anything so God sent a prophet yes in the day to be the church's first connection with that resurrected life and power what the first church possessed so now they were able to see it able to hear it and to be able to discern it now that's exactly what the first church had okay they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a book they didn't have a tape but they had a commission are you with me am I making any sense at all because sometimes I know I don't make sense but that's all right I'm going to read this little statement if I can this is on page 79 of the church age but these seven Messengers are making God known to the people okay he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them John 13:20 they speak and act upon his authority they and he stands behind them with all the the power of the godhead Matthew 28 18 and 20 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world so the consummation of the ages so the so there they are full of the Holy Ghost and faith on fire with the the fire of God holding forth the word of Truth and there he stands to back them [Music] up okay now picture this you don't have a Bible you don't have a book and you don't have the tape so you better have what an experience right you better have the you better be born again you better have what he sent them up to the upper room to get okay because now you're commissioned but you you you're you're not commissioned to go give intellect that's right you don't have a book so they can read the book and come up with a conclusion you don't have a Bible so they can study and try to put everything together you don't have a tape or a teaching you're one onone therefore the scripture said Faith cometh by what hearing and hearing by the word of God so the church was built on individuals sharing the gospel from Faith to Faith so they they couldn't just say here read this book here listen to this tape here go read Romans they couldn't do that they didn't have that and when Peter went to the gate called Beautiful he walked up to the m man and said here I have a tape for you I have a book for you I have a Bible for you now don't let anybody try to say I'm trying to do away with the Bible the books or the tapes okay if your brain is there then stay there but I want you that pet had [Music] something so he didn't give him another tool other than himself yes sir that's he said I know what I'm talking about silver and gold I don't have but I have something that I want to share with you but that which I have I give to youen that was the Faith of Our Fathers because they knew that he was standing with them to Back Him their words up their faith was in his presence what did I do with my glasses right where oh here they are I couldn't see CU I didn't have my glasses on okay so let's just follow this he was standing there to back him up and think of it not one believer of any age needs to cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age when the apostles were sent out oh how many have said that oh I wish I could have been back there no there is no need to look back look up Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages Behold Him who is the same yet there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and Giver of all good things to the church Hallelujah now they didn't have a Bible they had some letters from Paul that were read throughout the churches they didn't have books or tapes but but every believer that contacted another believer he had to spread the gospel with with three main elements right he had to have a changed life right there had to be some evidence that they came in contact with something that changed them and that change was evident we're talking about the faith of our early fathers see you can be backslid as a Goose and I guess that's okay to say and give someone a book or give somebody a tape fact you might even do that as some form of penance or or some sort of relief of conviction but that's not what the first church had okay they went out and they told all the world world of what had taken place in their life I heard about it these men asked me have you know they they expressed the guilt they they they they preached the gospel they they they shared the Commandments and the when I heard this my heart was pricked and I saidwell what must I do and they said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ The Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost another they War passing off a historical or intellect ual or doctrinal religion they were motivated by love and they said what happened to me can happen to you and I'm here to pray with you to lay hands on you to be with you until that change takes place in you church has lost that it's full of substitutes they'll have a ceremony let's get let's get the piano player going I'd like to bring a piano player up here and an organ player and let's get going and and and then we're going to start singing riseing up riseing up there's a church that is rising up and up and up and up and up and up and up and [Applause] up it's a ceremony it's a substitute they didn't have a Bible didn't have a book didn't have a tape they didn't have an organ but that which they had they freely gave now this is what he's trying to get us back to the church was built on a commission go wait until you're in dued for power from high so they never let somebody get away give me a moment I got to catch my breath that felt good though haven't put that much effort out in the three weeks you understand what I'm driving at yes sir it never left the individual right he didn't bring someone to church so the church service would take the place of his commission or his duty to share the gospel it was delivered by faith to Faith I know him him I've me him I know what he's done for me let me tell you what he's done that's right so first of all there had to be a changed life is that right again I I think if you could put up on the board of First Peter 3 and 15 so we have a Bible okay but now look at these scriptures as going out to people who didn't have a Bible and what that they were trying to keep in the church was the faith that was once delivered to him it says be Sanctified the Lord God God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear the gospel was built on changed lives of people inquiring about the transformation that had taken place in the church and and now they would say well let me tell you what happened this brother came and and he talk to me about the Lord and about the wages of sin and my heart was convicted because I didn't know it and he prayed with me and we got down and we prayed and he asked the Lord if the same spirit that was in him would come into me and I had an experience and the spirit of God Came Upon me and I was free I was free from burden I I I there was something that that welled up inside of me that made me different I felt the presence of the Lord I I I felt him speak to my heart it was a real experience it it wasn't intellectual it wasn't a conclusion that I came to it was a real change and then the gospel commission began to be carried out cuz people were inquiring what happened to you now can you imagine that if we had lives that intellectually stimulated so we become philosophers that's why it's no good to argue with somebody you know what I mean and there are certain churches you know if if you ever had met them I've dealt with them all the time you know uh uh uh you know people that are in certain denominations that don't believe in Divine Healing don't believe in Works don't believe in music they don't believe in any of that boy but they know they love to argue and that usually takes argument takes about one minute there's really no mean me talking to you because you don't know what I'm talking about there's no hunger there's no thirst there's no pull there's no call there's no seed so they didn't have a book they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a tape they had an experience now let me inject this we needed a Bible we needed a book we needed a tape cuz we were were so far from the truth there was no living Fountain but the first church had the fountain why do we have the books why do we have the tapes why do we have uh the Bible is to return us back to what they had when they didn't have it okay not the substit ude but there was those were ways for God to get to us because there was nobody hardly possessing the life at all so God had to send the light as it was in the days of Sodom and gomorah shall shall it be in the coming of the son of man they shall be light in the evening time the path the glory you shall surely fine so there was the dead Church World someone had to show up with the same life that the first church had and start pointing out in the Bible what they had lost and preaching sermons and all the books are is the sermons and writing but preaching the gospel just as they preach the gospel with signs and wonders following that the church might recognize hey we got a bogus and not an original so they had to have an experience life changing they had to have the word of their testimony right they spoke it they shared it they talked about it they went door to door person to person telling about it wow the Lord Jesus did you know there was a messiah do you know the Lord Of Glory came down we're going to all the world teaching them the things that I taught you telling them to observe the Commandments so they had to have a word of their testimony they had a life and then a word without the lives the words are just crazy I've had so many people come to me you know I was testifying to everybody at work and something came up and I got mad and I ruined my testimony I'm going to quit this job now I hope this don't offend you but that's a coward oh if there's controversy I'm out of here I'm out of here I don't want nothing to do with no controversy I don't want nothing to do with nothing you you know I mean hardly a backbone to stand up what does the scripture tell you to do if you offend somebody go to that person and say I'm sorry go to that person and said you know I've tried to live a Christian Life I failed the other day I made a mistake I shouldn't have done that would you forgive me you remember when our messenger went to the lawyer what was his answer oh I knew you was a hypocrite no he said you mean more to me now than I ever have that's what you do I'm sorry I lost it I wasn't prayed up I was grumpy Satan trapped me I'm going to try to do better but I want you to know I still believe everything I've ever said to you and I'm going to try to do better I'm going to let my light shine that's the worthier testimony that that that's what they had in fact it was so important the words that came out of their mouth because now they don't have something to speak for them or they don't have a tape to speak for them they don't have a Bible to speak for them they don't have a book to speak for them I think was it brother Murphy or somebody preached about it has its voice amen right so their life their change their experience now has a voice and that voice is coming out of their lips so if you could put up James uh 3 and 10 now we look at this scripture as being in the Bible James is looking at at this scripture to tell the church don't get the fountain polluted he it's not a book it's not not a Bible it's not a tape it's a letter that he's writing to his church to make them aware that they have to protect that element in their experience because that's a means by which the commission is going to be carried out was that simple enough listen what he says out of the same mouth proceedeth blessings and cursings my brother these things ought not to be is there more to that does the fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the fit tree my brethren bear Olive berries neither a Vine figs so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh who is the wise man endued with knowledge among you let him show out of good conversation his work works and meekness and wisdom an element that's so important to the church because they're The Voice anybody know what the bride is in this last day it's the what final voice is the last thing because he's restoring back the faith of our fathers he's giving back the church what they had before a Bible before a tape before a book before a Christian bookstore it no longer was going to be based on intellect and a personal life choice of how that they want to serve God can I go over that again it's not reading a book and hearing somebody explain how you should be a Christian and the things that you should do that you develop your own life your own way of service your own good and evil and come up with your own Christian Life this is back to an experience a conversion an upper room experience that the disciples went and passed down to the person that person passed it to the next that person T passed it to the next changing lives changing conversations the real genuine fruits back in the church what an awareness what a Consciousness and if I could say this then the last thing that they had was Works they practiced what they preached they had Works they didn't come to church and just live their life they didn't have a life of theology they didn't have a life of belief I believe this I believe that we believe this well this is what we believe we believe this and we believe that they knew him they it was personal contact the The Giver didn't pass intellect he wasn't trying to change their mind this is a quote that I could have found but it's just come to my heart because if you change somebody's mind somebody else will change it again this was the unconscious search that was in the heart of the believer to find that seed brother and sister somewhere they knew he was backing them up their faith was in his presence which they had experienced it wasn't intellect right they meant the person they experienced the person they experienced the touch they experienced the hand of the Lord they knew him they they shared what they knew they didn't pretend when they didn't and they knew he was there to back them up their faith was in his presence amen so they had Works John 13:35 they'll know that you are my disciples by your loved one for another it was evident uh back to the uh the word of their testimony Romans 10:17 Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God uh and then we said in Peter they inquire of the Hope Matthew 5:116 let your light so shine AB among men that your good works might glorify Your Father in heaven then the writer writes show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my Works they they had works right so here they are without a Bible to speak for them without a tape to hear preaching without a book or a track or anything they were the Bible the tape and the book they were the only vessel they were commissioned experienced ordained Fountain of truth and light and that's what they were that's what they went into the world with they weren't letting an instrument outside of themselves do the work for them how many have heard of AI well I'm preaching about RI r artificial religion AR artificial religion done without human participation it it's not the way the church wants to go now you know I believe in plain taste my I hope my actions you can understand what I'm trying to point out to you because you want to look at yourself you want to look at your experience you want to look at your atmosphere around you you want to say how am I going am I going in the way of the early church or am I in another way have I been brought back listen to some of the scriptures that the men began to preach pray without ceasing things that are pure and good think on these things make melody in your heart Make a Joyful annoying to the Lord all those things were the instructions of the Apostles to the Believers to keep that life alive in them right so now when you read the Bible start reading it that this thing was in what time is it because I know I'm going to fade away here in a second have I am I close to 45 minutes somebody surely in here has been tracking every minute I I hear it after every service boy it was good but it sure was [Music] long well every Christian the Long Ranger or The Lone Ranger that's right is everybody good can I can I get a few more minutes okay because I want to talk to you just a second if I could about uh okay so I I just want to read this I'm going to close here with this last little thought because I want to be in this for a while is that okay with you cuz we we want to find our way back to what it was that those guys had right okay now the Pentecostal movement became a substitute right he said that not was not the latter rain and the outpouring of the spirit it was Devil's inspired men getting inspired and bringing the church to an experience that wasn't the word so I'm going to read two statements and and I'll close and I'll try to get one of the brothers to cover for me tonight because uh I'm on fire for this I might not look like it but I'm on fire for this and I'm not only on fire for me I'm on fire for you I want every person in our body to have an upper room experience in their own heart and life I want every one of us to be able to say I know my redeemer liveth I know he's real I see him in my life and I want him to have the courage to stand for him for I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the power of God under salvation if you testify of me before men I'll testify of you before my father think of all these saying to people that didn't have a book didn't have a Bible or didn't have a tape it was speaking directly to the challenges they had in this world it wasn't to stir up their mind well it was to stir up their mind back to Pure thoughts but it was dealing with their heart because the the Satan was there trying to rob them and get them away from their first love so listen to this if you can put this this is on page 82 of the church age book and he says this I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that God's people have always been and always will be persecuted you know that Genesis is the book of beginning and what you find started there will carry right on through to Revelations and never change there we see that Cain persecuted and killed Abel because the latter pleased God I want to drop down and read this no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God now listen to this close and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessels in whom the spirit of Truth dwells man thank you Lord he can't destroy the spirit right he can't stop its power he can't stop nothing all he wants to do is crack the vessel so the spirit leaks out he wants to plug up the mouth he works on the vessel cuz it can't destroy the spirit that's Eternal so he works on the vessel so be aware of that you that's why you've got to be Sanctified and that's my weak spot it's real easy for my faith and what I believe and the Zeal to the word it makes me forget have wait a minute you got to protect this F I got a good looking truck but you can't tell it cuz it's filthy just like someone said that's a nice truck but sure should wash it what do you do you wash it you keep it clean you show your appreciation we need to show appreciation for the vessel of the Lord how many knows the scripture that that you are the temples of God now picture that scripture Paul writes that scripture because he's trying to protect or the whoever wrote it the elements of the church he's trying to keep the lukewarmness from setting in he's tell them to contend earnestly for the faith these scriptures weren't written that could study scriptures they were actually addressing a problem that was coming against the church is that clear they didn't have a book they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a tape they had their experience and a roaring line seeking to devour him and these men were writing the scriptures because they wanted to keep their experience alive they wanted to keep the words of their testimony alive and they wanted to keep their Works alive because that's how God chose to carry out the commission not with intellect but with being born again filled with the spirit praying without ceasing are you with me let me close now I want to just jump over here and read this last little section and it's on page 88 now this is the complaint okay so we're talking about we're Rising back up to what the faith of the fathers is the Ephesian Church age is addressing the Ephesian Church losing its first love right so you understand now we've got to come back and meet the complaint we're actually traveling through the church ages backwards you thought you were going forward you say no we don't go backwards we're going back to Eden that's right right we're going back to the Faith of Our Fathers we're going back from where we come from that's right right that's right we're going back to the bodies that he had prepared for us in his mind in the beginning so we could live in fellowship with him eternally until we dropped down and picked up this thing now he's bringing us back trying to get it back into our hearts the things that he's prepared for us so this is the complaint let's just read this if you'll stay with me just a few seconds nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted 120 years its message then is to all the generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fire fading in the next how many realize we've had a Revival the message of Malachi 4:5 was the greatest Revival that ever hit the earth since the Lord Jesus Christ it set campfires everywhere a burning Fade to the next and in the third generation ambers may be glowing sight slightly but in the fork there may be no V what is that whatsoever of the original flame what are we trying to get back to the original Flame not a substitute not a a Revival fire but a burning love in the heart of every individual manifesting him he then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated if it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth no more and is there any truth to a a Apostolic secession it isn't in the word you start out with true Born Again Believers and when the Next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptist Methodist except that is exactly what they are too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of men to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God but for a minute I do say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore what's our path our path is back to the original flame how many want the original Flame flame that was in the church burning back that's where God's trying to take you no I left out a big part about condemnation God don't condemn you he's trying to bring you and every single one of you are are free to have it just hold on a minute I'm I'm moving quick the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade has cooled off and become a bit formal the cry for the What Spirit we've got so much knowledge that we don't get in the spirit right you can read a book and listen to a t but don't listen intellectually get in the spirit be born again get in the spirit let God move on your heart stay there till you feel the presence of the Lord till you feel the unction till God's talking to you and you're obedient wouldn't it be once again wonderful if the church could go back and felt I was led the Lord spoke to me this morning I feel moved D on the spirit I have an unction to good works I'm on fire not I read I listened I passed out but my life isn't full don't go into condemnation okay because this isn't condemning us for where we we are this is prophesying to us of where we're going Hallelujah right let's just read that is what was happening back there in Ephesus they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them the abandonment to god wow the second generation coming up was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like other nations and when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change change their manner of dress sir their attitudes and their behavior they get laxed that is what emphasis means relaxed and drifting I'll just tell you that I came in this message in 6970 there is a big difference yes sir in the attitude of people and the respect for the messenger and the revealed word of God the Pentecostal Revival of the 1900s is hardly evident today it's been taken over by television evangelist it's been taken over by bobbed haired women preachers it's been taken over by all kinds of fanaticism it's been taken over by all kinds of money asking for this asking for that all kinds of programs all kinds of big big big big where's our path our path is back to our fathers just a few more statements to read the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took to the streets corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit too much of the power of God happens inside the Four Walls of the church each one of you has the power to pray for the sick to lead somebody for to Christ every brother in this church can baptize somebody Paul said I didn't baptize any of you ask yourselves where am I going what am I heading to what is it so without a Bible without a book without a tape these people had accomplished something by meeting the Savior face to face he says they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or in Old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they begin to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over they cried the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that is left we've got to come through that so we've arrived at this point where now we got to judge ourselves by the complaint we're the church we're the bride now we've got to stand there and face this complaint am I making sense we got to answer for it we're actually the Redemption of all the church behind us is that does it Dawn on you and me the importance of our position we're rising to a place that we come up to the complaint we recognize the complaint we recognize what happened and now through a personal contact and commission we break through that and enter back into the Faith of Our Fathers oh that's good stuff can we do it yes we can they ask Jesus can we be baptized with the baptism where you're in baptized with they saw the anointing on them they saw the Spirit on them they saw the works on them and they said can we have what you have what did he say yes go there and wait and I'll come again unto you and I'll Endo you with power from on high I'll be with you even in you that's what you're preaching to this world you're not preaching what was at Pentecost you're preaching what is in you now you don't have to manifest gifts in public you live a life amen I've sat with many a person and I'll just say this in my office and watch the Holy Spirit come down and tell them exactly where they're at what exactly they were thinking what is exactly was going on their life and what's exactly in their heart and watch them come to pieces in the presence of the Lord because they know it's AB absolutely the truth that's right you don't operate that right out here we got a revival going on in this message right now because people manifested gifts right and it just it it doesn't produce it and you know if it's wrong one time the whole testimony of it is gone think of how important it is for each of us to get back to the original Fountain it's about him it's not about us now let's just close with this last statement of reading a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God how many wants to know what it means and understand what it means to love God the great Apostle of Love would certainly see when the church begin to lose the first love of God in John 5 and3 he says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments the word one little deviation from the word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time but when it is all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people say they love God but not obeying his word oh Ephesus Church something is happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they are doing it so sub subbly that you can't see it at all they haven't made a move so big you can see it out there in the open it's Undercover and they are beginning it by the way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late think of it what was Pentecost people want to say it was the putting of gifts no those gifts came into the church because they needed them they didn't have books they didn't have Bibles they didn't have tap they had to be led of the spirit the spirit had to speak to them they set aside time to be speak from the spirit hear ye him it was an experience that changed their lives took them from cowards to laying their lives down a fire in their heart of fery for God I believe with all my heart this is the path not a deviation not a movement but a real personal contact of every believer in him an invisible Union between the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride where he finally says to the church The Works that I do the ministry will do also the works that I do the church will do also the work that I do you will do every man every woman every child every believer filled with the spirit of God the love of God shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Spirit Led of the spirit of God a fervent fire not varying from the word of God this is where he's taking us let's don't pick up a substitute along the way let's persevere till each of us can stand there knowing we have overcome the complaint of the loss of love that's right and we enter in to that that Capstone God bless you this morning thank you for bearing with [Applause] me [Music] s my thirsty Soul come up
