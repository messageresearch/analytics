[3:42] [Music]
[3:44] gracious and kind heavenly father
[3:46] [Music]
[3:51] what a day and what an hour lord to
[3:54] be able to come together
[3:57] recognize
[4:01] even the variability
[4:04] that we're able to come together lord
[4:09] is because there's an empty tomb
[4:12] there's a resurrection
[4:14] [Music]
[4:16] you think of
[4:18] mary magdalene
[4:24] lord your words recorded
[4:27] said she came early to the sepulcher
[4:31] while it was yet dark
[4:35] and found the stone
[4:37] rolled away
[4:40] [Music]
[4:43] lord she ran to get
[4:45] your disciples
[4:48] they came back and
[4:52] or they looked in
[4:53] you weren't to be found
[4:58] [Music]
[5:02] but lord
[5:05] you're worthy of a second look
[5:08] [Music]
[5:11] we're here again lord
[5:14] to find you
[5:16] lord you're not even in this sepulchre
[5:18] it's just a building
[5:21] the lord has been set aside and
[5:22] sanctified for the worship
[5:25] for the praise and honor and glory of
[5:28] god
[5:30] but now lord that we inhabit these
[5:32] spaces

[5:41] here amongst us
[5:43] lord you revealed yourself to mary
[5:47] [Music]
[5:49] and you called her by name
[5:55] lord was at that bidding that she
[5:57] recognized you
[5:59] [Music]
[6:00] she supposed you might be a gardener
[6:03] or someone attending the sepulcher
[6:07] the lord you called her
[6:09] may we recognize each one of us lord
[6:13] your continued calling
[6:16] you're wooing you're drawing
[6:19] lord we we all have a desire to come up
[6:21] closer

[6:25] let's hear the call
[6:27] and draw us closer to you lord we pray
[6:30] lord just be with us this day as we
[6:35] realize that
[6:38] through the fall lord you said every
[6:40] sickness every disease every
[6:43] siren every ambulance
[6:46] came from that disregarding of your your
[6:50] word lord
[6:52] but lord the
[6:53] the redemption the salvation the
[6:55] blessings the healing
[6:57] it all comes from the benefits
[7:00] of the cross of calvary

[7:05] morning lord
[7:07] and we are redeemable lord we thank you

[7:11] lord as we lift up these songs of praise
[7:13] and worship we pray that you just come
[7:14] down in a great and mighty way lord that

[7:39] all our visitors man we have many out
[7:41] and prayed it the lord will bring them
[7:43] back safe as they'll be traveling back
[7:45] home we'll invite very much for so i'm
[7:47] reading this morning god bless you
[8:03] good morning
[8:06] and we're going to continue to
[8:07] read in psalm 119 this morning we're
[8:10] going to begin at verse 17.
[8:13] i don't know about you but i'm really
[8:14] enjoying going through this chapter
[8:17] you know spending time on it you know
[8:19] certainly i hope you don't you know take
[8:21] out of this the things that i get out of
[8:23] it i hope you're spending time on your
[8:25] own just reading the wonderful things
[8:26] that are in here
[8:28] concerning a relationship with the word
[8:31] and you know as we read the portion this
[8:33] morning there's one particular verse
[8:34] that caught my attention
[8:36] that's verse 18 it says open thou mine
[8:40] eyes
[8:41] but i may behold wondrous things
[8:44] out of thy law
[8:46] you know what struck me as david was
[8:49] speaking of this that this is before the
[8:51] days of jesus
[8:52] this is you know a time when the law
[8:55] the tabernacle
[8:57] the priesthood
[8:58] were all were all kind of the it was
[9:00] that it was that day
[9:02] but yet here's david
[9:04] he's not a priest he's not a member of
[9:07] the ministry
[9:09] but in his psalm
[9:11] as he's describing his fellowship with
[9:12] the word his prayer is open thou mine
[9:15] eyes
[9:17] that i may behold wondrous things
[9:20] out of thy law
[9:23] you know he recognized
[9:25] that the wondrous things
[9:27] could only be seen
[9:29] if his eyes were opened amen
[9:32] you know notice he didn't say open thou
[9:34] thy law
[9:37] he said open thou mine eyes
[9:40] you see it wasn't the law that needed
[9:42] opening
[9:43] it was his eyes
[9:45] that needed opening
[9:48] we all familiar with the time when jesus
[9:50] was speaking with his disciples he said
[9:52] in luke 10 23 blessed are the eyes
[9:55] which see the things that you see
[9:58] for i tell you that many prophets and
[10:00] kings
[10:01] have desired to see those things which
[10:03] ye see
[10:05] and have not seen them
[10:07] more familiar might be matthew 13 16
[10:10] where he said but blessed are your eyes
[10:13] for they see
[10:15] in your ears for they hear
[10:18] you know jesus entire
[10:21] ministry
[10:22] was examples where he would speak the
[10:24] word
[10:27] the same word
[10:28] and two different people will have two
[10:30] different reactions to it
[10:32] some would see what he was saying
[10:34] some would be offended by it
[10:36] some would see the wondrous things out
[10:38] of the law and some would just take
[10:40] offense
[10:41] and it was the same word
[10:43] the difference was not the word it was
[10:45] the eyes
[10:46] whether they were open or not open
[10:50] first corinthians
[10:51] 2 9 says this but it is written
[10:55] i hath not seen
[10:57] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[10:59] the heart of man the things
[11:03] which god hath prepared for them that
[11:05] love him wondrous things
[11:07] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[11:10] his spirit
[11:12] for the spirit searcheth all things
[11:15] yea the deep things the wondrous things
[11:19] of god
[11:21] you can keep reading first corinthians
[11:23] to encourage you to do that it's all
[11:25] about the wondrous things
[11:27] that are in thy law
[11:29] but you see it takes someone to open
[11:31] your eyes
[11:33] to be able to see
[11:35] the wondrous things
[11:38] you know notice it says in verse 18 of
[11:40] psalm 119 it does it says open thou
[11:43] mine eyes
[11:45] not our eyes not the people's eyes
[11:48] my eyes
[11:49] his personal
[11:51] opening
[11:53] you know we certainly spend a lot of
[11:55] time in fellowship around the work that
[11:57] was done in our day
[11:59] where there was one who came and through
[12:00] that ministry
[12:02] things were loosed things were made
[12:04] known things were opened up
[12:06] but it doesn't take away from the fact
[12:08] that you still need your personal eye
[12:10] open
[12:11] otherwise it's second hand revelation
[12:14] otherwise i'm just hearing it i'm
[12:16] understanding it i'm agreeing with it
[12:17] but if your eyes haven't been opened
[12:20] it says open thou
[12:22] mine
[12:23] eyes
[12:25] my own
[12:26] that i may behold
[12:28] wondrous things
[12:29] out of thy law not a priest not a
[12:32] minister just david
[12:34] right
[12:36] but it requires you to encounter
[12:39] the opener
[12:41] you know and it's interesting we know
[12:43] from scripture you know man can open
[12:44] this book
[12:45] but only he can open the eyes
[12:49] and that's one of his attributes he's an
[12:51] opener
[12:52] there are things that only he can open
[12:56] it says in isaiah 22 22 in the key of
[12:59] the house of david will i lay upon his
[13:01] shoulder so he shall open
[13:04] and none shall shut and he shall shut
[13:08] and none shall open
[13:10] there's only
[13:11] he's the only opener that there is you
[13:14] have to know the opener for him to open
[13:17] your eyes
[13:19] he's always been an opener
[13:22] he opened
[13:23] many wombs that were shut
[13:25] in scripture
[13:27] he opened blinded eyes
[13:30] that people might see
[13:33] you know paul prayed in colossians 4 3
[13:35] that god would open a door of utterance
[13:37] to speak the mystery of christ he has to
[13:39] open up
[13:41] your mouth open your mouth and i will
[13:42] fill it
[13:44] he opens graves
[13:46] he opened a tomb
[13:49] one day
[13:50] 2000 years ago and from that opened away
[13:53] that we might enter he's the opener
[13:56] so unless you encounter the opener your
[13:58] eyes can't be opened to the wondrous
[14:01] things aren't you grateful for the
[14:02] opener
[14:04] that there's one who can open the eyes
[14:06] and my prayer and i hope your prayer as
[14:08] well is open thou
[14:10] mine eyes that i may behold
[14:14] wondrous things out of thy law
[14:17] so you know as we read this portion of
[14:19] psalm 119 this morning you know that
[14:21] should be our daily prayer
[14:22] that our daily walk that there's an
[14:24] opener that's opening our eyes to the
[14:27] wondrous things
[14:29] let's read that together starting in
[14:30] verse 17
[14:32] deal bountifully with thy servant that i
[14:35] may live and keep thy word
[14:37] open thou mine eyes that i may behold
[14:40] wondrous things out of thy law
[14:42] i am a stranger in the earth hide not
[14:45] thy commandments from me
[14:47] my soul breaketh for the longing that it
[14:49] hath unto thy judgments at all times
[14:52] thou hast rebuked the proud that are
[14:54] cursed which do air from thy
[14:56] commandments
[14:57] removed from me reproach and contempt
[15:00] for i have kept thy testimonies princes
[15:03] also did sit and speak against me but
[15:05] thy servant did meditate in thy statutes
[15:08] thy testimonies also are my delight in
[15:11] my counselors amen
[15:17] amen god bless you may have your seats
[15:26] oh yes i spent in canada

[40:10] comes and
[40:11] and
[40:14] him and amy bring their
[40:16] daughter this morning johanna
[40:19] hodesh and we
[40:21] we just ask that we can bless them this
[40:23] morning amen
[40:36] amen amen you hold this daniel i'm gonna
[40:39] daniel asked me to read this scripture
[40:41] and
[40:42] and uh we would like to do that for him
[40:45] on his request and it's found in the
[40:49] book of second timothy
[40:51] the 21st first through the 24th verse
[40:55] if a man therefore purge himself of
[40:58] these
[40:59] he shall be a vessel unto honor
[41:01] sanctified and meant
[41:03] for the master's use and prepared unto
[41:07] every good work
[41:09] flee
[41:11] also youthful us but follow
[41:13] righteousness
[41:14] faith charity
[41:16] peace with them that call on the lord
[41:21] out of a pure heart
[41:23] but foolish and
[41:25] unlearned questions avoid
[41:27] knowing that they do
[41:29] generate strife
[41:31] and the servant of the lord must not
[41:34] strive but be gentle unto all men
[41:37] apt to teach patient
[41:40] amen so that's those requests i'm sure
[41:44] is what he wants for his family

[41:50] beautiful and now brother daniel we ask

[44:09] amen
[44:14] we certainly uh
[44:16] love the word of the lord and and uh i'm
[44:20] i'm not going to minister too long
[44:22] but there's a little something that i
[44:24] felt to do this morning and
[44:27] yeah and you don't know the challenge
[44:29] every time that you feel led to do
[44:31] something
[44:32] there's so many voices in so many things
[44:35] that come against you you know
[44:38] but you you just got to
[44:41] trust the lord
[44:43] amen and in all my life i i find that
[44:46] that's the
[44:47] hardest thing
[44:49] for me personally to do you know i'm a
[44:53] fighter by nature you know i like to
[44:56] fight
[44:57] uh it's just in me i guess it's because
[45:00] i'm irish you know what i mean
[45:04] i i will fight for a believer
[45:06] i will stand in the corner shoulder to
[45:09] shoulder and fight
[45:11] and in doing that sometimes you
[45:16] you go about things and and you try to
[45:18] help god
[45:20] and it's hard to really come to the
[45:21] place to realize that god don't need
[45:23] your help
[45:25] amen that it's not what i've done for
[45:28] him it's what he's done for me and
[45:31] that's our testimony and and this is a
[45:34] great
[45:35] day for us because of it being easter
[45:39] because this is really the day
[45:42] that
[45:43] lets us realize what god has really done
[45:47] for us
[45:49] and you got to remember every single one
[45:51] of us in here received the curse
[45:54] when we were born
[45:56] and you know what that curse was right
[46:00] it didn't matter how much money you had
[46:03] it didn't matter how much health you had
[46:06] it doesn't matter
[46:08] how much
[46:10] how much fame you gained
[46:13] there was one thing waiting for you and
[46:15] that was death
[46:17] and then all your life then went to
[46:21] maybe a plaque
[46:24] or maybe a statue
[46:26] or maybe a line in an obituary
[46:30] it and all the sum and substance of your
[46:33] life all of a sudden became history
[46:37] there was really no more presence of
[46:41] your life in this world
[46:47] just think of it you were gone
[46:51] and the last words
[46:54] that are spoken over you
[46:57] are ashes to ashes and dust to dust
[47:02] in other words you can't you you came
[47:04] out of the dust
[47:06] you've gone back to the dust
[47:08] and so our last memory is saying
[47:12] goodbye
[47:13] we have the history of your life
[47:15] but now you're a pile of dirt
[47:20] oh wow
[47:22] isn't that just the way you want to end
[47:24] your life
[47:26] and to so many
[47:29] that's the end of life
[47:32] to so many if that that that's the the
[47:36] final
[47:37] thing of it your life has been written
[47:40] your story has been wrote you've done
[47:43] what you've done
[47:45] and many times a a young person is
[47:49] is
[47:50] taken from us god does that uh he allows
[47:54] people to to depart from this world uh
[47:57] from every age and and every time of
[48:00] life some old and
[48:02] some very young i've had to stand over
[48:05] babies and and that have passed and and
[48:08] stand in the graveyard and
[48:11] lay a child that's just a few months old
[48:14] into the ground
[48:16] and
[48:17] and all that can be spoken of is what
[48:20] could have been
[48:23] oh what potential this young man had
[48:26] he was he was so
[48:29] uh
[48:30] uh intelligent he was so smart he was so
[48:34] vibrant he was so wonderful and and all
[48:37] that can be spoken of is the things that
[48:40] he might have been or what could have
[48:43] been or or maybe even that could go as
[48:46] far as what should have been or or talk
[48:48] about the plans that they had but when
[48:52] it all was said and done it was done
[48:56] his life was done he didn't have another
[48:59] day he wasn't going to have another hour
[49:02] he wasn't going to have another sentence
[49:05] written about him that his history had
[49:08] now been
[49:10] uh embedded in the in the end loads of
[49:14] time
[49:16] until this morning
[49:19] hallelujah
[49:20] amen this morning was a gift to us that
[49:26] our story's not over
[49:29] amen that there's more after this in
[49:32] fact there's more after this than there
[49:35] was before this amen so paul wrote it
[49:38] this way oh death where's your sting oh
[49:41] grave where's your victory i've ran a
[49:43] good fight now i'm going to get the
[49:45] reward that waits for me
[49:48] this is the most
[49:50] changing event
[49:53] in our lives
[49:55] or it should be it should be
[49:59] because this changes
[50:02] everything
[50:04] this
[50:04] day
[50:06] changed everything this was the day that
[50:09] the curse of death
[50:11] was broken
[50:13] amen whoever believeth on me shall not
[50:16] perish but shall have eternal life
[50:21] oh that is something i wish that i could
[50:25] come to the full
[50:27] revelation of
[50:29] is that that
[50:32] if this
[50:33] earthly body be dissolved i have one
[50:36] waiting for me that just right over the
[50:39] edge of this realm of time is really the
[50:43] beginning of my existence
[50:46] this is just a small time period
[50:49] here
[50:50] this morning that
[50:52] god
[50:53] has placed us
[50:55] in a circumstance and a situation where
[50:58] he can reveal himself to us so let's
[51:02] once again let's stand and open our
[51:05] bibles to romans the 8th chapter and
[51:11] we'll once again read this great verse
[51:29] and we'll start at the sixth verse and
[51:32] read through
[51:33] he says for to be carnally minded
[51:37] is death
[51:40] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[51:44] peace
[51:47] because the carnal mind
[51:49] is an enmity against god
[51:52] for it is not subject to the law of god
[51:56] neither indeed can be
[52:01] so then
[52:03] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[52:07] god
[52:09] but you are not in the flesh
[52:12] ye are in the spirit
[52:15] for if ye be that the spirit of god
[52:18] dwell in you
[52:21] now if any man have not the spirit of
[52:24] christ he is none of his
[52:27] so we see the importance of this spirit
[52:31] he says and if christ be in you
[52:34] the body is dead because of sin
[52:38] but the spirit is life because of
[52:41] righteousness
[52:42] but if the spirit
[52:45] of him
[52:46] that raised up jesus from the dead
[52:50] dwell in you
[52:52] he that raised up christ from the dead
[52:55] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[52:59] the spirit that dwelleth
[53:02] in you
[53:03] amen let's just turn
[53:05] over and read a few paragraphs in in
[53:09] luke
[53:11] the last chapter of the gospel of luke
[53:15] luke 24.
[53:34] any and and luke
[53:37] the 24th chapter and the 44th verse the
[53:40] 44th verse of luke 24
[53:45] and he said unto them these are the
[53:48] words which i spake
[53:50] unto you
[53:52] well i was yet with you
[53:54] that all things must be fulfilled which
[53:58] were written in the law of moses
[54:01] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[54:04] concerning me
[54:07] amen
[54:09] then open heat their understanding
[54:13] that they might understand the
[54:16] scriptures
[54:18] and
[54:19] said unto them thus it is written and
[54:23] thus it behooves christ to suffer
[54:26] and to raise from the dead
[54:29] the third day
[54:30] and that repentance and remission of sin
[54:33] should be preached in his name among all
[54:36] nations beginning at jerusalem
[54:39] and ye are witnesses of these things and
[54:43] behold i send you the promise of my
[54:47] father upon you
[54:49] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[54:52] until ye be endued with power
[54:56] from on high
[54:57] god bless you you may be seated
[55:09] easter is such a a beautiful day
[55:13] because though
[55:16] in jesus's ministry
[55:19] they watched him do
[55:22] signs and wonders and signs and wonders
[55:25] over
[55:26] and over again
[55:28] and they knew that no man could do these
[55:31] works unless the father be with them
[55:34] so they understood that there was
[55:36] something about
[55:38] this uh
[55:40] this man
[55:42] that was different
[55:44] but i don't think they really realized
[55:47] what the real difference was
[55:51] they have stories of david slaying
[55:54] goliath they have stories of samson
[55:57] pulling down the pillars they have
[55:59] stories of joshua defeating
[56:03] thousands and thousands of philistines
[56:06] they have many testimonies down to the
[56:08] time they have the testimonies of moses
[56:12] and
[56:14] all the great works that moses done so
[56:16] they they knew
[56:18] that
[56:19] there was something about him
[56:22] that was different
[56:25] and and even the pharisees and the
[56:27] scribes would come to him at night and
[56:30] they would say rabbi
[56:32] we know no man could do these things
[56:34] unless god be with them
[56:37] but you know there was something
[56:40] greater that he possessed
[56:44] and and so they knew that he had this
[56:47] record
[56:48] they knew that
[56:50] he
[56:51] uh
[56:53] was doing great signs and wonders it
[56:55] wasn't like today where if he would heal
[56:59] somebody that
[57:01] instantly it would show up on some sort
[57:04] of media
[57:06] it was always
[57:07] meant by
[57:09] testimony
[57:10] because god chose the foolishness of
[57:13] preaching to spread the gospel
[57:16] he chose that man would
[57:19] speak one to another that it would be
[57:22] transferred by from faith to faith and
[57:27] that was the the great
[57:29] uh
[57:30] reality of it because every time
[57:33] somebody went up with the testimony the
[57:35] person that heard it
[57:37] was meant with the challenge
[57:41] of whether to believe or not
[57:46] could you imagine the the little blind
[57:49] boy that one of my favorite places in
[57:51] the bible
[57:53] is the young blind lad that received
[57:56] this site
[57:57] and
[57:58] he's arguing
[58:00] with the pharisees and the sadducees and
[58:03] the scribes on who had the authority to
[58:07] do this
[58:08] who had the power to open your eyes
[58:12] he says you are the leaders of israel
[58:17] and you know not by what this is done
[58:20] how can i have any confidence in you
[58:24] explain by what means what what
[58:27] authority he says i don't know he says
[58:30] but one thing i do know i was blind but
[58:33] now i see
[58:37] and the scripture said there is no
[58:38] record ever
[58:40] of a person being born blind
[58:43] that has received their sight
[58:46] just think of it
[58:49] there they were
[58:51] and this man was testifying
[58:54] and so they went and got his parents
[58:58] why because they were
[59:00] they were
[59:02] held captive
[59:05] by unbelief
[59:08] just think of it
[59:11] the fear and the captivity
[59:14] of unbelief
[59:16] was so strong
[59:20] and they were so rooted
[59:23] in their traditions and their religious
[59:26] background
[59:27] and their and their formal
[59:30] teachings and
[59:32] of and always being told
[59:35] what was right and what was wrong you
[59:38] know there's got to come to a place in
[59:40] your life where it's not the outside
[59:44] voice that tells you what's right or
[59:45] wrong it's an inside voice that tells
[59:48] you what's right and wrong
[59:52] that even the parents
[59:56] when they were questioned
[1:00:00] their own son
[1:00:03] that's been blind and just think of the
[1:00:06] trial
[1:00:08] that it must have been for those parents
[1:00:12] having a blind child
[1:00:15] teaching it to feel for its cup
[1:00:18] talking to it describing knowing that he
[1:00:21] had never seen their face
[1:00:25] that he would have to have a stick or
[1:00:27] maybe like a blind bartimaeus a seen
[1:00:31] lamb
[1:00:32] he would have to have help
[1:00:34] all his life
[1:00:36] and all of a sudden by the great
[1:00:40] majesty
[1:00:43] of the messiah he sees
[1:00:47] and when they question him and they
[1:00:49] question the mother and father
[1:00:51] they would not give answer
[1:00:56] they wouldn't stand up
[1:00:58] and identify
[1:01:00] with the very
[1:01:02] life
[1:01:04] that gave their child sight
[1:01:09] they said let him answer
[1:01:12] for himself
[1:01:15] and i thought oh my can you imagine
[1:01:20] there is no medical proof
[1:01:24] i'm surely many people said oh he never
[1:01:27] was
[1:01:28] born blind
[1:01:31] in the first place
[1:01:34] and they write it off
[1:01:37] and they write it off
[1:01:39] you know i wonder this morning
[1:01:42] that
[1:01:43] if
[1:01:44] like those parents
[1:01:47] sometimes we get so associated with the
[1:01:50] carnal life
[1:01:52] and the carnal mind
[1:01:54] that we have a tendency to write off
[1:01:58] the supernatural
[1:02:00] working in our lives
[1:02:04] that it's only a thing that
[1:02:07] occasionally
[1:02:10] might come our way
[1:02:13] but it isn't the
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:16] the the carnal mind is
[1:02:19] at enmity or i could use the words it's
[1:02:22] at odds
[1:02:24] it it
[1:02:25] it's not an agreement or it's going in a
[1:02:29] different direction
[1:02:31] than god's going the carnal mind is
[1:02:35] concerned about the present god's not
[1:02:38] concerned about your present he's
[1:02:40] concerned about your future
[1:02:45] there's nothing in your presence
[1:02:49] that god can't take care of
[1:02:52] there's nothing that
[1:02:54] is too hard
[1:02:56] for him
[1:02:59] but
[1:03:00] he
[1:03:01] when they inc when they inquired of
[1:03:04] jesus
[1:03:06] in all the
[1:03:08] works that he's
[1:03:10] had performed
[1:03:12] and they asked that
[1:03:14] they would see him
[1:03:16] he he never pointed to
[1:03:19] the lady down the street that was healed
[1:03:22] or this thing's he pointed to something
[1:03:25] that was greater he said destroy this
[1:03:28] temple
[1:03:29] and in three days i'll raise it up again
[1:03:34] hallelujah that was the power
[1:03:37] that he wanted the church
[1:03:41] to understand and come up be acquainted
[1:03:44] with
[1:03:46] it was the power of the resurrection
[1:03:50] the power that can quicken amen
[1:03:54] that was what was granted he was uh so
[1:03:58] wanted them to realize that it not only
[1:04:01] could quicken this blind person
[1:04:05] not only could it quicken this lame
[1:04:07] person not only could it quicken the
[1:04:10] devils out of people but it can quicken
[1:04:13] your mortal body
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:17] it can take the curse
[1:04:21] of death
[1:04:25] it's a privilege to me this morning
[1:04:27] because i have the oldest member
[1:04:31] of my ministry
[1:04:34] in the building
[1:04:37] this morning
[1:04:39] and don't look for an old person
[1:04:43] but ben
[1:04:44] sitting right over here
[1:04:47] when we still had our little hippie
[1:04:49] commune
[1:04:50] his mother
[1:04:51] marianne being a part of it leslie
[1:04:54] delivered him
[1:04:57] he got his
[1:04:58] first
[1:04:59] breath of life
[1:05:01] i've i don't know how old you are now
[1:05:03] how old are you now
[1:05:05] 49 years
[1:05:06] ago amen
[1:05:09] because the oldest person in here
[1:05:12] outside of leslie
[1:05:14] that was a part all of our children were
[1:05:16] born
[1:05:17] after
[1:05:20] but that's the power
[1:05:23] that he wanted him to see
[1:05:26] he wanted to recognize that there was a
[1:05:29] quickening power
[1:05:32] that there was a power
[1:05:34] and a life
[1:05:36] that he had to offer
[1:05:40] and that life and that power
[1:05:43] that he had to offer was so powerful
[1:05:47] that he could give a testimony so he
[1:05:50] spoke to him he said believe
[1:05:54] if you don't believe me for my words
[1:05:59] believe me
[1:06:00] for my works
[1:06:05] because they are which
[1:06:07] testify of me
[1:06:10] now i want you to see the beautiful
[1:06:12] pattern here
[1:06:15] he does the works and he does the signs
[1:06:17] and wonders
[1:06:19] because he has a message
[1:06:23] and we know that every discernment and
[1:06:26] every gift of discernment and everything
[1:06:29] that is spoken in all the works that
[1:06:33] were done
[1:06:34] he said god never did those type of
[1:06:37] works unless there was a message
[1:06:40] that follows
[1:06:45] and that's the truth
[1:06:47] because he was gathering them up
[1:06:51] and the message wasn't woke that there
[1:06:54] was deliverance in the land though he
[1:06:57] fulfilled every prophecy
[1:07:00] the message that he wanted to get across
[1:07:02] to the church and to every believer that
[1:07:06] would follow is that there's life after
[1:07:08] death
[1:07:12] oh what we could endure in this life if
[1:07:16] we were absolutely convinced
[1:07:21] there was life after
[1:07:28] so he told them to go up into that room
[1:07:31] can you wait
[1:07:34] because though i'll send you the promise
[1:07:37] of the father
[1:07:39] what was that great promise of the
[1:07:41] father
[1:07:43] jesus said i will not leave you
[1:07:45] comfortless but i
[1:07:47] personal pronoun will come again and i
[1:07:51] will be with you and i will be in you
[1:07:56] there's so much confusion nowadays about
[1:08:01] what the holy spirit is
[1:08:04] it's an office
[1:08:06] it was god above us
[1:08:09] then it was god with us
[1:08:12] in flesh
[1:08:14] and now jesus said the same spirit
[1:08:17] that's in me i
[1:08:19] personally i am the father who he who
[1:08:23] hath seen me
[1:08:24] hath seen the father i'm the physical
[1:08:27] manifestation
[1:08:29] of the father i'm the lamb of god
[1:08:33] i've become you
[1:08:36] that you can become me
[1:08:39] i'm laying down my life
[1:08:43] so you can have my life
[1:08:47] eternal life
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:51] we could have the same spirit
[1:08:55] now think of that
[1:08:58] that we could have the same spirit that
[1:09:01] dwelt
[1:09:03] in him
[1:09:05] in us
[1:09:06] that's the gift of god
[1:09:10] that's the gift
[1:09:11] of
[1:09:12] the resurrection
[1:09:14] it wouldn't have done any good if he
[1:09:16] just paid the price for our sins
[1:09:20] and we still had to finish our jail term
[1:09:27] it wouldn't do any good if if he paid
[1:09:30] the price
[1:09:31] and we still had to reap everything
[1:09:35] that we sowed
[1:09:38] you know that's what the mercy of god is
[1:09:42] so many times you've sowed things that
[1:09:44] you should reap but yet in his mercy and
[1:09:47] his goodness he takes the sentence away
[1:09:51] from you
[1:09:53] he throws it in the sea of god's
[1:09:55] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[1:10:00] and not only that but he beckons you
[1:10:05] or invites you
[1:10:07] and calls to you and says
[1:10:10] i want to
[1:10:11] come in to you
[1:10:13] amen
[1:10:14] i want behold i stand at the door knock
[1:10:18] if any man open i will come into him and
[1:10:21] i will suck with him
[1:10:24] he wants to infuse
[1:10:28] his spirit into you
[1:10:33] oh but we've got the enemy i call it the
[1:10:36] enemy of the mirror
[1:10:39] the enemy of looking at ourselves
[1:10:42] the enemy of the carnal mind
[1:10:46] how could it be
[1:10:49] how can he take me
[1:10:52] everything i've done everything i've
[1:10:55] thought the things that i've done when
[1:10:57] i've known better
[1:11:00] still wipe it clean
[1:11:05] that's the kind of love
[1:11:08] that he had
[1:11:10] in fact that's what he finally capstones
[1:11:13] this whole age off is with great love
[1:11:20] and so he proved to us
[1:11:23] this
[1:11:24] easter that he's alive
[1:11:29] now what does it mean that he's alive
[1:11:32] if he's alive that means he's present
[1:11:39] and if he's present
[1:11:41] and he was present back then
[1:11:45] then all the works that he did back then
[1:11:49] he can do today
[1:11:53] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:11:56] and forever
[1:11:57] it's not a different resurrected jesus
[1:12:01] it's the same jesus
[1:12:04] that was resurrected but man still looks
[1:12:08] back
[1:12:10] and they
[1:12:12] worship him for the resurrection that
[1:12:15] was
[1:12:18] but remember in this message we listened
[1:12:20] he said what a resurrection
[1:12:22] that was what a resurrection this is
[1:12:31] that the same quickening power
[1:12:35] the same power that brought him to life
[1:12:38] out of the grave
[1:12:41] that he wants to share that
[1:12:45] with us
[1:12:46] this morning
[1:12:50] oh
[1:12:51] the carnal mind
[1:12:54] says no
[1:12:56] take a look at me
[1:12:59] the spiritual mind says he died for that
[1:13:01] part of me
[1:13:05] he didn't seek me
[1:13:08] i didn't seek him
[1:13:09] he sought me
[1:13:11] he brought the word to me of life
[1:13:15] and that life is still so beautifully
[1:13:20] prevalent
[1:13:21] this morning
[1:13:25] peter went to that upper room
[1:13:30] and he received
[1:13:33] that quickening power
[1:13:35] it wasn't too long before that
[1:13:38] that he had denied him
[1:13:41] three times
[1:13:43] that he was a coward
[1:13:46] he was
[1:13:47] afraid
[1:13:50] but now this
[1:13:53] spirit of life
[1:13:56] when the lord jesus christ came back to
[1:13:58] him
[1:14:01] and infused himself
[1:14:03] into him
[1:14:05] then he had confidence
[1:14:08] in the quickening
[1:14:10] power
[1:14:13] and if i had a title i would say this i
[1:14:16] would call it confidence in quickening
[1:14:19] power
[1:14:20] confidence in quickening power
[1:14:23] the carnal mind
[1:14:26] automatically sets up the defense of
[1:14:29] reasoning
[1:14:30] how could it be
[1:14:32] how could this happen how what by what
[1:14:35] authority
[1:14:36] is this done
[1:14:39] the carnal mind all of a sudden builds
[1:14:42] all the realms of circumstance
[1:14:47] they feel their deliverance is trapped
[1:14:50] within the circumstances of their lives
[1:14:56] it's like sickness
[1:14:59] sickness is fenced in by symptoms
[1:15:04] that we feel that as long as the
[1:15:06] symptoms there
[1:15:08] the sickness is there
[1:15:12] but that's the difference
[1:15:15] of this quickening power
[1:15:18] the symptoms are not what holds it
[1:15:21] there's nothing that holds it it's done
[1:15:24] by the will of god at his bidding in his
[1:15:26] will
[1:15:31] this quickening power if you have
[1:15:33] confidence in it
[1:15:35] this quickening power this it's a gift
[1:15:38] of god
[1:15:39] it's not something that you can go get
[1:15:46] you can buy somewhere or find somewhere
[1:15:49] it's something you have to wait on
[1:15:54] go to the upper room
[1:15:57] carry their weight
[1:15:59] i gave you a promise
[1:16:03] and if i gave you a promise i there's
[1:16:06] one thing i can't do is i can't lie
[1:16:08] don't put a time clock on it don't put a
[1:16:11] symptoms on it don't build a fence
[1:16:14] around it have confidence in the
[1:16:16] quickening power of god that he can do
[1:16:19] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:16:21] you can ask or think
[1:16:27] that
[1:16:30] those cages
[1:16:34] can be
[1:16:36] broke down
[1:16:38] because god doesn't tear the cage down
[1:16:40] from the outside
[1:16:43] he tears the symptoms down
[1:16:46] from the inside
[1:16:50] once you have confidence once he spoke
[1:16:52] to you once he's told you once you've
[1:16:54] heard that voice you're healed
[1:16:57] you're delivered
[1:16:59] you look out and you still see the
[1:17:01] fences
[1:17:04] you still see the captivity
[1:17:07] you still see the gates
[1:17:10] or he's come into your life
[1:17:13] but now is when you stand up because you
[1:17:15] got confidence in that power and that
[1:17:18] revelation that he faith he give me you
[1:17:20] start possessing those gates satan
[1:17:22] you're a liar
[1:17:26] i'm carrying you down
[1:17:30] i'm plugging this hole
[1:17:35] the quickening power
[1:17:39] is what tears satan
[1:17:43] it's what down them
[1:17:45] it's what takes it from word to reality
[1:17:48] you don't have to be in conflict with
[1:17:50] yourself you don't have to be in
[1:17:52] conflict with your feelings what you've
[1:17:55] got to do is have confidence
[1:17:58] in his word
[1:18:00] and his quickening power
[1:18:03] and where did that
[1:18:05] quickening
[1:18:06] power come from
[1:18:09] it came from the defeat of death
[1:18:15] because the result of every
[1:18:17] disease is death
[1:18:20] in fact the result of the time world
[1:18:24] that we live in is death
[1:18:33] i was just thinking that
[1:18:36] if i did the math and
[1:18:39] ben's 49 i'm 72. so how old would that
[1:18:43] make me
[1:18:44] about 22 years of age
[1:18:48] and you can see the effect
[1:18:52] of time
[1:18:55] because that's part of the curse
[1:18:59] but that doesn't hold me
[1:19:02] you understand that my body aches and
[1:19:05] and i get sore and i get weary more easy
[1:19:09] that doesn't affect me because i've got
[1:19:11] confidence that what's in me will be
[1:19:14] quick and it'll quicken this mortal body
[1:19:16] and then i'll rise again
[1:19:22] that that quickening power is not a
[1:19:24] historical memory that is something
[1:19:26] that's alive this morning and lives here
[1:19:30] to do exactly what it said it would do
[1:19:33] now our proof of that
[1:19:36] is a resurrection
[1:19:41] how do we know
[1:19:44] how can we
[1:19:46] prove
[1:19:49] that
[1:19:51] he's risen
[1:19:55] as long as it's in word form only
[1:20:01] it's just a testimony
[1:20:05] it's just a record of event
[1:20:09] if i say jesus is risen from the dead
[1:20:12] and you say well prove it to me
[1:20:16] well i can go to the scriptures and say
[1:20:18] well here it says it
[1:20:22] well that's
[1:20:25] just a record
[1:20:26] of events
[1:20:28] that's just like george washington cut
[1:20:30] down the cherry tree
[1:20:34] right
[1:20:35] and he threw a silver dollar across the
[1:20:37] potomac
[1:20:41] you know
[1:20:42] how many believes that george washington
[1:20:44] never told a lie
[1:20:47] why because it's anti-word scripture
[1:20:49] says we come into the world speaking
[1:20:51] lies
[1:20:53] you know so we know better in those
[1:20:55] things
[1:20:56] but
[1:20:58] just be leaving it
[1:21:00] from
[1:21:01] this alone
[1:21:05] isn't a true record
[1:21:08] the proof of his resurrection
[1:21:11] you can say well it did something for me
[1:21:14] personally
[1:21:17] and they could simply say well that's
[1:21:19] psychology
[1:21:22] many a person
[1:21:24] has went to a psychiatrist
[1:21:27] and a psychologist
[1:21:29] and they were able to put their thought
[1:21:31] pattern back together
[1:21:33] that they could travel down that road i
[1:21:35] don't want to travel down the road of a
[1:21:37] psychiatrist
[1:21:39] or a psychologist
[1:21:43] i have a promise
[1:21:47] that if i would believe in the name of
[1:21:49] the lord jesus christ that he would give
[1:21:52] me power to become the sons and
[1:21:55] daughters of god
[1:21:58] now it's 11
[1:22:00] 28.
[1:22:03] so
[1:22:04] we're having service tonight at six
[1:22:06] o'clock
[1:22:08] because
[1:22:09] of dinner and also because of
[1:22:13] so many of our
[1:22:15] young people be coming back in
[1:22:17] around that time so parents don't have
[1:22:19] to run
[1:22:20] back and forth
[1:22:23] but i want to
[1:22:25] take you this morning
[1:22:30] back
[1:22:30] to easter
[1:22:36] april 10th
[1:22:38] 1955.
[1:22:42] and i want us to listen
[1:22:45] as jesus christ
[1:22:47] proves
[1:22:49] that he's
[1:22:50] alive that he's risen
[1:22:54] and that he's there
[1:22:57] to quicken
[1:22:59] it's 30 minutes so if we start right now
[1:23:02] we'll be done by noon
[1:23:05] then we can
[1:23:07] go our way
[1:23:09] but if if he's alive
[1:23:14] from the time that he rose
[1:23:17] and he's the same
[1:23:19] it wouldn't matter when
[1:23:22] in timeline he would appear
[1:23:26] as long as we understood it was him
[1:23:32] it's him he's here
[1:23:35] and if he's here
[1:23:39] then couldn't you also touch the hem of
[1:23:42] his garment
[1:23:44] couldn't you also go to him and say cast
[1:23:47] this spirit off of me
[1:23:52] couldn't you like the blind
[1:23:55] man in blind bartimaeus couldn't you
[1:23:57] like the 10 leopards couldn't you like
[1:23:59] the men possessed by demons couldn't you
[1:24:03] like the widows
[1:24:04] and all the people in the scriptures
[1:24:08] that went to
[1:24:10] him
[1:24:12] if he's the same wouldn't he be the same
[1:24:14] this morning
[1:24:16] if that power that quickening power the
[1:24:19] power that he had over the grave
[1:24:24] couldn't he also
[1:24:28] have power over every circumstance
[1:24:31] in your life
[1:24:34] as the brothers get ready to play this
[1:24:37] i'd like to read to you
[1:24:41] we read part of this on daniel
[1:24:44] but he's talking about he said and the
[1:24:46] servant of the lord
[1:24:48] must not strive
[1:24:50] but be gentle unto all men
[1:24:54] apt to teach patient
[1:24:57] in meekness
[1:24:59] instructing those that oppose themselves
[1:25:06] this morning if there's anything within
[1:25:08] you you've got to understand that that's
[1:25:10] not the real you
[1:25:12] it's something that's opposing you
[1:25:16] it's something that's fighting against
[1:25:18] you whether it's depression whether it's
[1:25:20] nervousness no matter what it is it's
[1:25:23] something that's opposing you
[1:25:26] and keeping you from having the full
[1:25:29] life that you deserve in christ it's the
[1:25:32] enemy
[1:25:33] it's a fence
[1:25:37] it's a prison it's a captivity
[1:25:40] and this is what he does
[1:25:42] he says oppose themself
[1:25:45] if god pre-adventure will give them
[1:25:47] repentance
[1:25:48] to acknowledging of the truth
[1:25:54] and that they may recover themselves
[1:25:58] out of the snare of the devil
[1:26:02] who are taken captive by him
[1:26:06] at his will
[1:26:11] everything sickness is satan
[1:26:15] placing his captivity on you
[1:26:21] habits
[1:26:23] are satan placing his captivity
[1:26:27] on you
[1:26:28] depressions emotions doubts fears all
[1:26:32] those things are things that satan uses
[1:26:35] to place his captivity on us
[1:26:39] but that's what he came
[1:26:42] he came out of that grave to leave
[1:26:45] captivity
[1:26:47] captive
[1:26:48] he came to captivate
[1:26:52] what was captivating you and bring it
[1:26:54] unto his captivation by this quickening
[1:26:58] power
[1:27:00] so as we listen i want you to listen
[1:27:02] closely
[1:27:04] because he says so many beautiful words
[1:27:07] in this next 30 minutes
[1:27:09] but what the title of this is is the
[1:27:12] proof
[1:27:13] of the resurrection
[1:27:15] the present day proof
[1:27:19] of what really proves
[1:27:21] that he's alive
[1:27:24] and what our commission to us was the
[1:27:26] works that i do
[1:27:28] shall do you do also
[1:27:30] i believe you'll be thoroughly blessed
[1:27:33] as we pick up the beginning of the
[1:27:35] prayer line easter
[1:27:38] 1955.
[1:27:40] it is
[1:27:41] phenomenal
[1:27:42] god bless you i love you with all my
[1:27:44] heart
[1:27:47] now father i pray that you'll be
[1:27:49] merciful
[1:27:50] and now
[1:27:52] for your glory lord i pray that you'll
[1:27:54] grant it right here
[1:27:56] today in the tabernacle
[1:27:58] to settle it forever
[1:28:01] that you have rose from the dead amen
[1:28:07] now in the name of jesus christ i ask
[1:28:10] this blessing for god's glory
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:15] now
[1:28:18] for the glory of god
[1:28:20] and for the power of his resurrection
[1:28:24] or the omnipotence of god
[1:28:26] i now take every spirit in here under my
[1:28:29] control
[1:28:30] in the name of jesus christ
[1:28:32] so do as you're told
[1:28:35] and now i want that lady here to stand
[1:28:37] right here by the microphone
[1:28:41] i know the lady i i think her name is
[1:28:43] sutton i'm not mr cop oh cobb i'm sorry
[1:28:46] um i've seen the woman before
[1:28:49] sure she comes here to tabernacle once
[1:28:51] in a while
[1:28:53] and now but i know nothing of what's
[1:28:56] wrong with her
[1:28:58] but now the only way that i would have
[1:29:00] of knowing that would be some way that
[1:29:02] god would have telling me isn't that
[1:29:04] right mrs yes it is but cobb it's right
[1:29:08] cobb is your name now all right all
[1:29:10] right mrs cobb the only way that i know
[1:29:12] that what was wrong with you would be
[1:29:15] god would have to reveal it to me yes
[1:29:18] and then if he would do that they would
[1:29:20] have to come through a supernatural
[1:29:22] power
[1:29:23] that doesn't belong to human beings it
[1:29:25] would have to come from divine power
[1:29:27] isn't that right
[1:29:30] and then in doing so
[1:29:32] would that make you believe that i've
[1:29:33] told you the truth about his
[1:29:34] resurrection
[1:29:36] would it make you believe it friend now
[1:29:38] what
[1:29:39] what if jesus was standing here with
[1:29:41] this suit on that he gave me
[1:29:44] and he and he was standing here if it's
[1:29:47] now the woman may have financial trouble
[1:29:48] she may have domestic trouble she may
[1:29:50] have sick troubles i don't know
[1:29:53] god knows that i don't know
[1:29:56] i can't tell you it may be that she's
[1:29:58] done something in her life it's called
[1:30:00] every water trouble is to come up on
[1:30:02] earth i don't know god does
[1:30:05] i don't but he can tell me
[1:30:07] well that's what it is jesus said i do
[1:30:09] nothing except the father shows me it
[1:30:12] has to come through that
[1:30:13] now what i'm doing to this woman here
[1:30:16] will be not reading her mind
[1:30:18] no sir
[1:30:21] god forbid
[1:30:22] god knows that that's wrong it won't be
[1:30:25] god in heaven my judge knows that's not
[1:30:26] right
[1:30:28] not reading her mind but it'll be
[1:30:29] through the power of the resurrection
[1:30:31] amen jesus christ
[1:30:38] how paul and different ones looked upon
[1:30:40] the people
[1:30:41] and they perceived that there were
[1:30:43] certain things that were wrong
[1:30:47] jesus talking to the woman at the well
[1:30:49] he carried a conversation with her
[1:30:51] now we all know that saint john the the
[1:30:54] fourth chapter he talked to the woman at
[1:30:56] the well
[1:30:59] and while talking to the woman after
[1:31:01] well he was merely catching her spirit
[1:31:03] the father had told him to go up for the
[1:31:05] way of samaria
[1:31:07] jericho where he was going dried
[1:31:08] straight down like this from jerusalem
[1:31:10] but he went way around samaria because
[1:31:12] the lord told him to go up there and he
[1:31:14] sat there on the well sent his disciples
[1:31:16] away
[1:31:17] he knew the woman was coming when she
[1:31:19] come with her water potty she said bring
[1:31:20] me a drink she said it's not customary
[1:31:23] for you to ask me such
[1:31:25] he said but if you know who you were
[1:31:26] talking to you'd ask me for a drink i'd
[1:31:28] give you waters you didn't come here to
[1:31:29] draw
[1:31:30] is that right
[1:31:32] then after the conversation went on a
[1:31:34] little while he finally found just
[1:31:36] exactly where her trouble was said go
[1:31:37] get your husband
[1:31:39] she said i have answered that shrine
[1:31:42] that's right said you have five and the
[1:31:45] one you have now it's not your husband
[1:31:47] she said i perceive that you're a
[1:31:48] prophet i know when messiah cometh he'll
[1:31:50] do this
[1:31:51] or he'll tell us things but who are you
[1:31:54] he said i'm he that speaks to you
[1:31:56] now that was jesus
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:32:01] uh lady the only way that i have
[1:32:04] anointed would be had to be some kind of
[1:32:06] a contact between you and i
[1:32:09] with god
[1:32:10] that would make it known
[1:32:12] have you ever seen that picture they've
[1:32:14] taken of the angel the lord standing

[1:59:44] if it can quicken
[1:59:46] death
[1:59:48] which was the ultimate curse of sin
[1:59:52] then it can heal

[2:00:46] he knows everything about you he knows
[2:00:48] where you've been he knows what you've

[2:01:44] morning i hope it was a blessing to you
[2:01:47] this morning let us
[2:01:49] bow our heads
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:55] many people in this scripture
[2:01:59] look to the lord jesus
[2:02:02] and the lord would say do you believe
[2:02:06] and they would say lord help my unbelief
[2:02:08] [Music]

[2:02:34] emotional
[2:02:38] physical
[2:02:42] feeling
[2:02:44] father it's a confidence
[2:02:47] in the quickening power
[2:02:49] it's a confidence that you're alive that
[2:02:52] you're not historical
[2:02:55] but you're standing here this morning
[2:02:57] because you promised
[2:03:00] that wherever two or three gathered in
[2:03:02] your name that you would be there
[2:03:06] and father i know there's needs
[2:03:09] in the assembly

[2:03:20] going from one side of the room to the
[2:03:22] other racing back
[2:03:24] those spirits calling out from one
[2:03:27] another evil spirit
[2:03:28] and he said it was it was gallbladder
[2:03:32] and they were healed
[2:03:35] they were healed because you rose from
[2:03:36] the dead and you were standing in that
[2:03:38] room
[2:03:39] right there in the form of the pillar of
[2:03:42] fire
[2:03:45] and father you've given us blessed are

[2:03:54] and you've quickened into us a life
[2:03:57] that believes this morning that you've
