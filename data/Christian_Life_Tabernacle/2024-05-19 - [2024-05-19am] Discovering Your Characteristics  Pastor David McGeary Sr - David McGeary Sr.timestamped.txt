[55:22] a vessel and completely tear it down
[55:26] that he he can rebuild
[55:28] it just the way that he would want it he
[55:32] does it with nailed scarred hands and he

[56:12] precious and holy name we pray amen amen
[56:17] God bless you if you have your Bibles
[56:18] this
[56:21] morning uh sister lesie sends her
[56:24] greetings uh she's watching this morning
[56:28] um in San Diego um helping watch my my
[56:32] mother and my mother's doing good she
[56:34] was um really low at one point and we
[56:38] became super concerned and and uh she's
[56:42] just seem to have a perk up so we're
[56:44] grateful for that um um we don't know I
[56:50] mean my mom's not sick she's just old
[56:53] you know what I mean and and uh
[56:57] um I look at her and of course I can't
[56:59] complain too much
[57:01] about the way that I feel because uh she
[57:05] does so well but uh we're grateful for
[57:08] the touch of the Lord in her life so uh
[57:12] we just be with that um am I still good
[57:15] on the uh height and everything we're
[57:19] still working out the sound a little bit
[57:21] we still have some speakers coming uh
[57:24] which should eventually get everybody
[57:26] listening to the same that we trust that
[57:28] God will be your portion let's turn in
[57:30] our Bibles to the book of Hebrews and we
[57:34] want to read a couple of scriptures
[57:38] first found in Hebrews 1 and then we'll
[57:41] turn to Hebrews 13 so the first chapter
[57:45] of Hebrews and the last chapter of
[57:47] Hebrews and then uh everything in
[57:50] between is real good too so if you get a
[57:54] chance to read everything in between
[57:57] that' be
[57:58] wonderful amen so let us read this uh
[58:01] this
[58:02] morning it says God who at sundried
[58:06] times and in diverse manners spake in
[58:11] times passed unto the fathers by the
[58:17] prophets hath in these last days
[58:21] spoken unto us by his
[58:24] son who whom he hath appointed heir of
[58:29] All Things by whom also he made the
[58:35] world who being in the brightness of his
[58:39] glory and the expressed image of his
[58:43] person now that's what Jesus was he was
[58:46] the expressed image of the person of
[58:52] God the expressed image of his person
[58:56] and upholding All Things by the word of
[59:01] his power when he hath by himself purged
[59:05] our sins sat down at the right hand of
[59:10] the Majesty on high amen he by himself
[59:15] purged us of our sins oh if the church
[59:19] could ever get that issue settled in
[59:22] their hearts and their minds what a
[59:24] difference it would make and that
[59:27] Hebrews the 13th chapter uh starting
[59:31] with
[59:32] the the fifth
[59:35] verse it says let your
[59:38] conversations be without
[59:42] coveted and be
[59:44] content with such things as ye have for
[59:49] he hath said I will never leave thee nor
[59:54] forsake thee amen so that
[59:58] we may boldly
[1:00:01] say the Lord is my helper and I will not
[1:00:07] fear what man shall do unto me gracious
[1:00:12] father we ask you to bless your word in
[1:00:15] your precious name we pray amen you may
[1:00:18] be
[1:00:24] seated I'm prac practicing on trying to
[1:00:28] preach a little bit shorter so uh in
[1:00:32] order to do that you've got to help me
[1:00:35] you know what I mean so you you have to
[1:00:37] reach out and if a thought strikes you
[1:00:40] you grab a hold of it and then you pull
[1:00:44] to uh push us down the road you know so
[1:00:47] if you're kind of lagging behind then we
[1:00:51] got to drag you along and and that just
[1:00:53] takes longer so I'm getting too old to
[1:00:56] drag people so now you've got to push me
[1:01:01] so that's what we're hoping this morning
[1:01:03] that the word of God will uh uh just
[1:01:06] encourage your heart uh I I shared with
[1:01:10] you last Wednesday night how that I was
[1:01:12] fellowshipping with Matthew and we got
[1:01:16] to talk and and I I I got inspired um by
[1:01:21] uh this event that took place that uh
[1:01:26] he showed me and it it was on YouTube
[1:01:31] and we were talking about discovering to
[1:01:35] discover something and so when you
[1:01:38] discover something it's already in
[1:01:40] existence you understand so you didn't
[1:01:44] create it you didn't invent it but you
[1:01:49] you happened to fall upon it now you may
[1:01:53] have fallen upon it inadvertently
[1:01:56] or you may have fallen upon it in a
[1:01:59] search or you may have been searching
[1:02:01] for something else and come across
[1:02:03] something I do that quite often you know
[1:02:06] I'm not a a good
[1:02:08] bookkeeper so bookkeeping is a box with
[1:02:11] papers in it to me and Leslie for the
[1:02:16] last uh 50 years has been trying to find
[1:02:20] envelopes and files for everything that
[1:02:23] I throw in a box and but I many times
[1:02:27] I'll go through the box uh looking for
[1:02:30] something and when I get in there I
[1:02:32] discover something else oh i' been I've
[1:02:35] been looking for this and it it was
[1:02:37] there all the time I I love that song he
[1:02:41] was there all the time but it just so
[1:02:44] happened you discovered him if you could
[1:02:48] understand that and and we Tred to use
[1:02:50] that to separate that a little bit from
[1:02:54] the word revelation though they're
[1:02:56] synomous that that you come across
[1:02:59] something but it was more in discovering
[1:03:03] as the the fact of of of the part that
[1:03:06] we play and so we were preaching a
[1:03:09] little bit on the subject of why we
[1:03:13] read why we listen and why we pray so
[1:03:18] why do we read and and why do we listen
[1:03:21] and why do we pray and and part of that
[1:03:24] reason is that we might discover
[1:03:26] something we read uh uh to uh uh in
[1:03:32] trusting and hoping that something will
[1:03:35] rise to the surface and speak to us that
[1:03:39] we'll discover a truth we'll discover a
[1:03:42] revelation that will discover an
[1:03:45] understanding that will discover an
[1:03:47] answer that will discover a teaching uh
[1:03:51] a principle that now can become a part
[1:03:54] of the way that we live and and and it
[1:03:58] becomes mean meaning meaningful to us
[1:04:01] and therefore we we do that we read that
[1:04:03] we discover we listen because faith
[1:04:07] comes by hearing a a lot of times I I
[1:04:11] like to put on that great Bible reader I
[1:04:14] think his name's uh Alexander scorby I
[1:04:17] think is how you pronounce his name and
[1:04:20] by listening to him read many times I
[1:04:23] hear the scriptures in a different light
[1:04:26] than I heard him before and it causes me
[1:04:29] to pause a little bit and think about
[1:04:32] what he said and uh uh and and listening
[1:04:36] and and you you pick up things by
[1:04:39] listening uh uh by by hearing faith
[1:04:43] comes by hearing understanding it's one
[1:04:45] of the methods by which God talks to our
[1:04:48] heart and through hearing we can
[1:04:51] discover things we could uh I I I've
[1:04:54] been places and and and just overheard a
[1:04:57] conversation you know oh I just passed a
[1:05:00] wreck coming down the highway and sure
[1:05:03] enough that was exactly the way I was
[1:05:05] going to go and so now I by hearing that
[1:05:08] I discovered that that's not the path I
[1:05:12] want to go down a lot of times
[1:05:14] testimonies will uh become Discovery to
[1:05:18] you you can hear a testimony and find
[1:05:21] yourself I was in that same situation
[1:05:24] and and here's somebody that suffered
[1:05:26] what I suffered and you could discover
[1:05:28] that God did something for them and that
[1:05:32] he'll understand then that he can do the
[1:05:34] same thing for
[1:05:35] you okay and so and that's why and
[1:05:38] that's why we we we pray uh we pray so
[1:05:43] we can work our ways through our own
[1:05:46] feelings our own emotions our own doubts
[1:05:49] our own mental battle we call it praying
[1:05:52] through you know where you pray through
[1:05:55] and you know how it is when you sit down
[1:05:56] and pray the first thing that comes up
[1:05:59] is oh you know I I I got a nail in my
[1:06:02] tire and I've been putting air in it for
[1:06:05] a couple weeks now I've got to go get
[1:06:07] that fixed you know and oh I sure wish
[1:06:10] my boat had a new set of batteries and
[1:06:14] you know I think my and you're
[1:06:16] praying you know all this stuff's going
[1:06:19] through your mind you know what I mean
[1:06:21] do I got dog food do I got this if and
[1:06:25] you and and you got to you got to stay
[1:06:27] there right because why you're praying
[1:06:30] is you're trying to discover the
[1:06:32] presence of the Lord you you want that
[1:06:35] Spirit to come into your heart you want
[1:06:38] God to start speaking back to you and so
[1:06:41] you pour out for a while and and you
[1:06:44] settle yourself down and you get through
[1:06:46] all the pieces of the puzzle and and and
[1:06:49] your phone rings and the someone knocks
[1:06:52] on the door and and and if you don't
[1:06:55] stay with it you will never discover any
[1:06:59] benefits of
[1:07:01] prayer and and prayer is a tremendous
[1:07:05] beneficial thing to the believer amen it
[1:07:09] puts you in balance it lets you know
[1:07:11] that God still loves you it gives you uh
[1:07:15] excuse the expression my vocabulary is
[1:07:17] not very big but it gives you a chance
[1:07:20] to
[1:07:21] vent and I'll tell you I'd rather vent
[1:07:24] on somebody that understands then vent
[1:07:26] on somebody who don't cuz then they look
[1:07:29] at you crosseyed and they think that
[1:07:32] you're a little
[1:07:34] different you know what are you getting
[1:07:36] on me for you know I didn't do
[1:07:38] nothing you know and many times you hear
[1:07:41] the expression I'm just venting wouldn't
[1:07:43] it be good if you could get all rid of
[1:07:45] all those frustrations at the throne you
[1:07:48] could let the Lord know I'm Lord I'm
[1:07:51] frustrated I'm fighting through life I
[1:07:54] my I'm hurting I'm I'm going through
[1:07:57] this I'm full of uncertainties I have
[1:08:00] all these things and if you just stay
[1:08:02] there a while and you pray and pretty
[1:08:05] soon his presence starts coming down and
[1:08:08] you know that he hears
[1:08:10] me that's the scripture says he hears us
[1:08:13] and and you know after you've talked a
[1:08:15] little bit you might just sit there long
[1:08:18] enough to start
[1:08:19] listening and then he speaks to your
[1:08:22] heart and you discover his will you
[1:08:25] discover your answer you discover so
[1:08:28] many things that God has for you and and
[1:08:33] we miss a lot of things because we don't
[1:08:35] use prayer as a means of Discovery and
[1:08:40] so uh we we were talking about that
[1:08:44] Wednesday night the the need uh to
[1:08:50] discover and and and we want to be
[1:08:54] discoverers
[1:08:56] okay so we're not looking for something
[1:08:58] that doesn't
[1:08:59] exist but you you long for a person to
[1:09:03] discover the peace of God that's her
[1:09:05] path is understanding how many knows the
[1:09:08] peace of God exists you know there's a
[1:09:10] lot of people that have never discovered
[1:09:12] the peace of God Paul says it right here
[1:09:15] he he says we we can we can know this
[1:09:19] one thing we can boldly say that that
[1:09:23] he's my keeper and and I will not fear
[1:09:27] what man can do to me what has happened
[1:09:29] you've entered into the peace of God
[1:09:31] you've discovered the comfort that comes
[1:09:34] with knowing that you're in the palm of
[1:09:36] his hand and nothing can pluck you out
[1:09:40] that that's important to a Believer to
[1:09:42] discover that it's important for the
[1:09:45] believer to discover that their sins are
[1:09:47] forgiven and they're that they're thrown
[1:09:49] in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be
[1:09:52] remembered no more you've got to come to
[1:09:55] that place there's there's certain
[1:09:57] things you've got to discover before you
[1:09:59] can go any
[1:10:02] further you know Benjamin Franklin
[1:10:04] discovered you shouldn't fly a kite in a
[1:10:08] thunderstorm you know or or whoever that
[1:10:11] you want to say that they invented
[1:10:14] things most people never invented
[1:10:16] anything because there's no new thing
[1:10:18] under the sun they just discovered it
[1:10:21] and so if we could discover all the
[1:10:24] riches and the blessings that God's got
[1:10:27] for his church wouldn't it be something
[1:10:30] but we just don't want to be content and
[1:10:33] think oh I've come as far as I can
[1:10:38] go why that's
[1:10:41] discouraging here I
[1:10:43] am this is
[1:10:45] it take it or leave
[1:10:48] it I'm going to hear the same old sermon
[1:10:50] Sunday the same old style the same old
[1:10:53] bald dead big nose it's all the
[1:10:56] same nothing there for me I just can't
[1:10:59] wait I hope you preach short I want to
[1:11:01] visit with a few people and I always
[1:11:03] like going out to eat you know somebody
[1:11:05] usually buys my dinner so that's what
[1:11:07] I'm here
[1:11:10] for well you can sure get out of balance
[1:11:13] that way you can sure miss things but
[1:11:16] when you can get to a place that you
[1:11:18] come into the spirit of Discovery I'm
[1:11:21] here today to discover the presence of
[1:11:23] God I'm here today to discover
[1:11:26] uh Revelation I'm here today to discover
[1:11:29] if I have any faults I'm here today that
[1:11:32] God does something for me exceedingly
[1:11:34] and abundantly even above that which I
[1:11:36] can ask her
[1:11:38] thing now you're you're you're in a the
[1:11:42] spirit of moving
[1:11:45] forward you got to go forward to
[1:11:50] discover you know I don't know who
[1:11:53] discovered America first some people say
[1:11:55] Leaf Ericson discovered it some people
[1:11:58] say that Columbus discovered it well I
[1:12:01] think the people that were living here
[1:12:02] all the time had discovered it long
[1:12:04] before any of those
[1:12:11] people they discovered it the people
[1:12:13] that come just ruined
[1:12:19] it you
[1:12:21] know that that's why it's so important
[1:12:24] for the believer
[1:12:26] to discover the word of
[1:12:30] God and and I thought brother Ben the
[1:12:32] other night did such a wonderful thing
[1:12:35] when he was preaching a little bit about
[1:12:38] customs and things
[1:12:41] and
[1:12:42] civilization you know that that uh that
[1:12:47] culture is
[1:12:49] taught do you understand if if if if any
[1:12:53] of you in this church was born into
[1:12:57] our
[1:12:59] family you know you would eat tacos the
[1:13:01] way we eat
[1:13:04] tacos you know you would have
[1:13:06] goulash the way we have
[1:13:09] goulash you know and goulash isn't made
[1:13:11] with
[1:13:13] macaroni it's made with
[1:13:16] potatoes I don't know what you call
[1:13:18] goulash but if it's got noodles in it it
[1:13:20] ain't goulash you know what I mean
[1:13:23] goulash is Hamburg is hamburger meat
[1:13:26] with all the grease and
[1:13:29] potatoes and that'll feed an Irishman
[1:13:32] real
[1:13:33] well and you'd grow up with that that
[1:13:36] you would actually be that way because
[1:13:39] you're taught things well you understand
[1:13:42] that's why we're a people we're not a
[1:13:46] religion we are not a religion we are
[1:13:50] not a a a uh uh we're not belonging to a
[1:13:54] religion a bunch of doctrines and a
[1:13:57] bunch of teachings and a bunch of Creeds
[1:13:59] that's not what we're belonging to we're
[1:14:02] a culture we're a people that are being
[1:14:05] taught by our Lord and we're discovering
[1:14:10] something we're discovering our
[1:14:13] culture our way of doing things our way
[1:14:16] of thinking not this way this way this
[1:14:19] country that country but a born again
[1:14:23] Spirit-filled way of
[1:14:28] living and that's what we're here for
[1:14:30] this morning to do is we're here to
[1:14:33] discover that way of life and to
[1:14:36] discover if there's parts of our life
[1:14:38] that aren't lining up to
[1:14:42] it and I I I told the story so we're
[1:14:46] that's I want to build on that for a few
[1:14:48] moments this morning but the story of
[1:14:51] Discovery was and we were talking about
[1:14:53] Wednesday night it takes
[1:14:56] somebody uh some method or some means or
[1:14:59] something to take place for you to
[1:15:02] discover
[1:15:03] something and you can look this up on
[1:15:06] the YouTube I guess they call it it was
[1:15:09] shown to me
[1:15:11] there this man and his wife were
[1:15:15] sitting in their home and he had
[1:15:19] recently lost one of his
[1:15:21] legs he was destitute
[1:15:25] he was
[1:15:27] broke and in his own words I never had
[1:15:31] nothing never had
[1:15:34] anything and they would watch the
[1:15:37] Antique Road Show that is a a show where
[1:15:43] people bring items that they have that
[1:15:46] they don't know what it's worth and they
[1:15:48] bring them to
[1:15:49] appraisers and the appraisers look at it
[1:15:52] and they say oh this is a picture of
[1:15:55] such and such by such and I would say
[1:15:58] today on today's market it would go for

[1:19:27] 1,500,000
[1:19:30] an
[1:19:32] original
[1:19:34] Navajo blanket with the original dyes
[1:19:39] from the original flowers and whatever
[1:19:42] else they used he was lying on a million
[1:19:50] 500,000 over the back of his
[1:19:53] couch wow
[1:19:58] he
[1:20:02] discovered what he
[1:20:04] had and what it was
[1:20:08] worth and I want to talk to you this
[1:20:11] morning because I think a lot of us
[1:20:14] haven't discovered
[1:20:17] something and you know and I'm I'm not
[1:20:20] going to take it down to the routes of
[1:20:23] discovering the baptism of the holy
[1:20:25] spirit because you probably wouldn't be
[1:20:28] here if the Holy Spirit wasn't dealing
[1:20:30] in your life some
[1:20:32] way you say well I don't want to be here
[1:20:35] my mom made me come here that's the holy
[1:20:44] spirit so I'd like to read this
[1:20:49] statement and I want you to understand
[1:20:53] that as we go
[1:20:55] forward this is
[1:20:57] established so this is not what we're
[1:21:01] exactly trying to discover or what I
[1:21:04] want to talk to you about this morning
[1:21:06] but I want you to have this
[1:21:08] understanding because this is part about
[1:21:11] what we want to
[1:21:12] do you are the pure virtuous sinless
[1:21:16] Bride of the son of the Living God
[1:21:20] remember a couple of Sundays ago what we
[1:21:22] wanted to start be able to say
[1:21:25] that's
[1:21:26] me that's
[1:21:29] me you are The Virtuous sinless Perfect
[1:21:35] Bride of Jesus Christ he said
[1:21:40] that I believe it I don't understand it
[1:21:44] but I believe it that's
[1:21:49] me now you might have a lot of
[1:21:51] doubts that's because you couldn't make
[1:21:54] me
[1:21:56] that and you can see all my faults but
[1:21:58] he don't see any of them thank Lord now
[1:22:01] listen close he says every man and woman
[1:22:06] that's born of the spirit of God and
[1:22:08] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:22:12] believes every word of God stands as
[1:22:15] though you never sinned in the first
[1:22:17] place you are perfect the blood of Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ how can you if a man
[1:22:25] if I was supposed to die in the
[1:22:28] morning and a man took my place I cannot
[1:22:32] die for that sin somebody took my
[1:22:37] place do you understand if they charge
[1:22:40] somebody with a
[1:22:42] crime and they put that person in jail
[1:22:45] for that crime they paid your
[1:22:50] price you don't have to go to jail for
[1:22:53] that crime somebody took your crime for
[1:22:57] you and if if someone took your place
[1:23:00] for all your
[1:23:02] sins and paid the price for all your
[1:23:06] sins you can't pay that price
[1:23:11] again that's the fallacy of the Catholic
[1:23:14] church and that was the whole
[1:23:17] Foundation of
[1:23:19] justification Luther said wait a minute
[1:23:22] there can't be two prices paid for the
[1:23:25] same
[1:23:27] sin if Jesus died for my sins then why
[1:23:30] do I have to say hell Mar's Glory bees
[1:23:33] light candles and and and and do all
[1:23:37] those things I've already been
[1:23:41] Justified when will we come to the place
[1:23:43] where we K quit paying the price for our
[1:23:46] sins we keep keep beating ourselves up
[1:23:55] you know what I mean if it's not even
[1:23:57] laid to your
[1:23:59] charge who can lay anything to the
[1:24:02] charge of God's
[1:24:04] elect
[1:24:06] right because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:10] freees us from all sin so many people
[1:24:14] sit under Ministries that just beat them
[1:24:17] down and beat them down and keep them in
[1:24:20] captivity oh if you miss Wednesday night
[1:24:23] you're going to hell if you don't pay
[1:24:25] your tithe you're going to hell if you
[1:24:27] when I come in you don't bow down to me
[1:24:29] as Pastor you're going to hell well God
[1:24:32] got good news for you I ain't going to
[1:24:38] hell that was settled a long time ago my
[1:24:41] name's written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:24:45] Life I don't have to prove to you that
[1:24:47] I'm going to Heaven by what you think I
[1:24:51] ought to do and you don't need no honor
[1:24:55] bestowed upon any man other than the
[1:24:57] honor that God gave him and let me tell
[1:25:00] you what he gave the honor he gave the
[1:25:03] great honor to the ministry as being
[1:25:06] servants not Lord over God's Heritage
[1:25:12] servants they're here to
[1:25:14] serve well who's greater the master or
[1:25:18] the
[1:25:19] servant the
[1:25:21] master you're part of The Who
[1:25:25] you're part of the master you're the
[1:25:28] master you're not the servant too many
[1:25:31] people got things
[1:25:36] backwards let me I got to move on CU I'm
[1:25:38] going to be long so I'm going to hurry
[1:25:42] so I hope you just can gobble it up as
[1:25:45] quick as I can say it you are perfect
[1:25:49] cuz somebody paid your price and Jesus
[1:25:52] the word took my place he he became me
[1:25:56] that a sinner that I might become him
[1:26:01] the
[1:26:04] word amen let me hold true to it not the
[1:26:11] church the
[1:26:16] word now that's
[1:26:18] something because if we're not careful
[1:26:21] and I I I see it happening all around
[1:26:24] the country is that we're starting to
[1:26:26] get Church
[1:26:28] identity and you know what comes with
[1:26:30] church identity Church
[1:26:33] politics each church is starting to
[1:26:35] develop their Doctrine on this their
[1:26:38] Doctrine on the Holy Ghost their
[1:26:40] Doctrine on the gifts they're Doctrine
[1:26:42] on that they're Doctrine on that we
[1:26:44] stand for this and it it's falling back
[1:26:47] into the same mass confusion that we all
[1:26:50] were hoping we come out of
[1:26:57] right it ain't the
[1:27:00] church it's the word and the word has
[1:27:04] never
[1:27:06] changed we're reading the same gospel
[1:27:09] that Paul wrote you know the same the
[1:27:13] the same Bible the same thing so that
[1:27:17] that's what it is so we just read it
[1:27:20] says and the spiritual union of Christ
[1:27:23] and his church now when the flesh is
[1:27:27] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:27:30] flesh right so the word became flesh now
[1:27:35] our flesh is becoming word so it's
[1:27:37] happening both right so when one comes
[1:27:40] from one way and one comes from another
[1:27:43] way so for example if you had a car
[1:27:45] coming this way 100 miles an hour and a
[1:27:48] a car coming this way 100 miles an hour
[1:27:50] and they're going to
[1:27:52] meet what are you going to have
[1:27:55] have those two are going to become
[1:28:03] one yeah well that's what's
[1:28:06] happening we're going one way and he's
[1:28:08] coming this way and we're going to meet
[1:28:11] and when we meet it's going to be in a
[1:28:13] union you believe
[1:28:16] that he said manifested Vindicated just
[1:28:20] what the Bible said would happen in this
[1:28:23] day it's happening day by day so just
[1:28:27] what the Bible said is
[1:28:29] happening is happening day by day you
[1:28:33] understand that everything that's
[1:28:35] happening out there is happening day by
[1:28:37] day but it's just what the Bible said
[1:28:40] would happen there's nothing new going
[1:28:42] on
[1:28:43] here everything's according to the word
[1:28:46] of God everything's according to the
[1:28:48] plan of God it it's exactly on
[1:28:53] tune the thing that we want to get to is
[1:28:55] where our place is in
[1:28:58] it he said and then he makes this
[1:29:01] statement why it's accumulating so fast
[1:29:05] out there in those
[1:29:08] deserts you know everybody takes that
[1:29:11] quote and they make it one event in a
[1:29:14] desert he says out there so fast in
[1:29:17] those
[1:29:18] deserts I don't know what he was seeing
[1:29:21] I don't know how many deserts I don't we
[1:29:23] need even know what the definition he
[1:29:25] meant was desert in those dry places in
[1:29:28] those backsides of the desert where
[1:29:31] people get alone with God where you go
[1:29:34] out on the back side of the desert you
[1:29:37] know what what's on the back side of the
[1:29:38] desert
[1:29:40] nothing when you get alone with God you
[1:29:43] can't take
[1:29:47] nothing you finally at you and him out
[1:29:50] on the backside of the desert in the in
[1:29:53] those places that that I've been alone
[1:29:55] with God there's so many things have
[1:29:57] happened there in those places that I
[1:30:00] I've been alone with God in those
[1:30:02] backside places where I didn't bring
[1:30:04] anything with me not my troubles not my
[1:30:07] worries I prayed through them all till I
[1:30:10] got in his presence and he spoke to me
[1:30:13] things
[1:30:16] happen things ought to be happening in
[1:30:18] our
[1:30:20] lives God ought to be alive and moving
[1:30:23] and and and if you got enemies you need
[1:30:26] to pull your sword and start fighting
[1:30:28] them and driving them out and take
[1:30:30] possession of the gates of the enemy gra
[1:30:33] grab back your inheritance in your
[1:30:37] land don't live below your
[1:30:42] privilege so he said he said in those
[1:30:45] deserts taking place that it couldn't
[1:30:48] even keep up with it we're near the
[1:30:50] coming of Jesus to be United with his
[1:30:54] Church where the word becomes the word
[1:30:57] call of the Holy Spirit searching the
[1:31:02] hearts the call of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:05] searching the hearts that's really what
[1:31:08] should be happening here this morning
[1:31:10] the call of the Holy Spirit searching
[1:31:13] our
[1:31:16] heart because
[1:31:18] why something will be discovered
[1:31:25] you might have an ability that you don't
[1:31:27] even know you have you may have a
[1:31:29] spiritual
[1:31:30] blanket in your
[1:31:33] life instead of having a a terrible
[1:31:37] feeling about yourself instead of
[1:31:39] comparing yourself to everybody instead
[1:31:42] of thinking you want to be in a
[1:31:44] different mindset a different body type
[1:31:48] a different uh uh you know I always
[1:31:51] think to myself you know I think well
[1:31:54] you think what it's going to be like
[1:31:55] what you're going to body type is going
[1:31:57] to look like when you've been sitting at
[1:31:58] a table eating for a thousand
[1:32:02] years you might as well get this flesh
[1:32:04] out of your
[1:32:06] picture we spend way too much time way
[1:32:09] too much money on something that
[1:32:14] dying he said he he he said now listen
[1:32:18] what he said you stand
[1:32:21] completely you never sinned at at the
[1:32:24] first place God don't even
[1:32:31] know no I you I don't I I can't
[1:32:36] understand that I thought God knows
[1:32:40] everything everything came from him if
[1:32:43] he didn't think it it didn't
[1:32:47] exist so if he said it don't exist it
[1:32:50] don't exist who's making it exist then
[1:32:55] not
[1:32:56] God the devil the devil's making you
[1:33:00] exist as a sinner the devil's making you
[1:33:03] exist is a failure the devil's giving
[1:33:05] you complexes the devil's making you
[1:33:08] fear all those things are of the
[1:33:13] devil right the devil is not part of our
[1:33:19] culture we don't have room for the devil
[1:33:24] how many of you got a bedroom in your
[1:33:25] house for the
[1:33:30] devil we normally call that the TV room
[1:33:33] but maybe you might call it something
[1:33:40] else you go there what this is my master
[1:33:43] bedroom and this is our kitchen hope
[1:33:46] this is our dining room and up here and
[1:33:48] this is the devil's
[1:33:50] room yeah the we we have the devil
[1:33:53] living with with
[1:33:55] us no sorry
[1:33:58] devil you know what I mean you don't
[1:34:00] live
[1:34:01] here now you may come
[1:34:04] in but when you come in you're a
[1:34:07] burglar how many knows the scripture
[1:34:09] says that a thief a
[1:34:13] liar right and what do you do with him
[1:34:16] you cast him out you throw them out what
[1:34:20] prophet of God called that applying the
[1:34:22] token if if you find a devil you apply
[1:34:25] the token you cast them
[1:34:28] out sometimes if you read you'll find
[1:34:32] some sometimes if you listen You'll find
[1:34:35] some sometimes if you pray you'll find
[1:34:37] some because what's the purpose of the
[1:34:39] word of God is to expose the
[1:34:44] devil how many wants a hidden
[1:34:48] devil nobody wants to have a couple
[1:34:50] hidden Devils
[1:34:52] around where you get alone with somebody
[1:34:54] and say this is my
[1:34:58] devil how are you doing today fine my
[1:35:01] demons a little upset but everything
[1:35:03] else is
[1:35:08] good we don't got to live like
[1:35:13] this I don't care what your past is I
[1:35:16] just read you that God don't even know
[1:35:19] your
[1:35:21] path you're the only person keeping it
[1:35:25] alive trouble is we keep other people's
[1:35:28] past
[1:35:34] alive he he doesn't even know it it's in
[1:35:38] the sea of forgetfulness you never did
[1:35:41] it you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:35:45] but really from the beginning you were
[1:35:48] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:35:51] of God you're standing there
[1:35:55] washed your old book of divorcement is
[1:35:58] put away it's dead absolutely out of
[1:36:01] existence even in the mind of God so the
[1:36:06] only thing that remains in the mind of
[1:36:10] God is what came from the mind of God in
[1:36:13] the beginning anything that didn't come
[1:36:16] from the mind of God that Satan tricked
[1:36:19] you into
[1:36:24] right by your old sinful nature he paid
[1:36:28] for
[1:36:29] that
[1:36:32] thanes right and now by preaching of the
[1:36:35] word of God he's wanting you to discover
[1:36:42] something to become aware of
[1:36:46] something he said you're The Virtuous
[1:36:50] bride washed in the blood of
[1:36:55] Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of
[1:36:58] God standing with a pure unadulterated
[1:37:01] word bride and he Washed by the washing
[1:37:05] of his own blood that became flesh
[1:37:08] manifested that he might take you which
[1:37:12] were
[1:37:13] predestinated in the bo of the father
[1:37:17] before the beginning the same as he was
[1:37:20] and he was the great attribute
[1:37:23] of
[1:37:24] God now so if we
[1:37:29] can
[1:37:30] understand that we're not trying to
[1:37:34] discover our
[1:37:39] forgiveness now we need to but we need
[1:37:42] to move past that there's got to be
[1:37:45] something else he even says in the
[1:37:47] scriptures he says let's not lay again
[1:37:49] the foundation of laying on the hands of
[1:37:51] speaking in tongues but let us move on
[1:37:54] to
[1:37:56] Perfection
[1:37:59] so this sermon go a lot of ways but I
[1:38:01] want to just keep it in one little train
[1:38:05] of thought this morning and I want to
[1:38:09] call
[1:38:13] it discovering your
[1:38:17] characteristics or knowing your
[1:38:21] characteristics I want our desire is to
[1:38:25] make it
[1:38:27] personal uh not just
[1:38:31] uh personal to you but also uh
[1:38:37] personal uh to me and so I'm I'm saying
[1:38:42] that this is where I'm at I'm realizing
[1:38:46] that I have got to come to some
[1:38:49] conclusions I've got to answer some
[1:38:52] questions I've got to put the end to
[1:38:55] some
[1:38:56] issues that I I'm not going to be able
[1:38:59] to continue on in the mindset that I am
[1:39:04] the life pattern that I am that if if
[1:39:08] there's a a higher spiritual Mountain de
[1:39:11] climb and there's a deep that's calling
[1:39:14] me to a deeper place that I I'm not
[1:39:17] going to get there until that I discover
[1:39:20] the answer to issues
[1:39:27] now I I'm a
[1:39:30] Believer I believe I'm a believer I'm
[1:39:33] not happy with the way I live all the
[1:39:36] time no but I'm thankful that if I sin I
[1:39:41] have a petitionary before the father and
[1:39:44] I can cry ABA father and he's faithful
[1:39:47] and just to forgive me of all sins but
[1:39:50] if I can move a step higher that's what
[1:39:54] my heart's desire is and so I I I looked
[1:39:58] and I began to notice some uh things
[1:40:03] that
[1:40:03] were uh quite uh see if I can find where
[1:40:09] it is that I would like to uh read to
[1:40:13] you
[1:40:16] first and what I realized is that what I
[1:40:20] really got to find is my
[1:40:28] identity
[1:40:30] now we could look at somebody and today
[1:40:35] I went to put
[1:40:36] money in my own bank account at my
[1:40:42] bank and this bank's on the second floor
[1:40:45] of this building I had to walk through
[1:40:47] the parking lot climb up the stairs take
[1:40:49] the elevator got in there I said this is
[1:40:51] my name this is my account number I want
[1:40:54] to put this money in this
[1:40:56] account they said do you have an
[1:40:59] ID I said you misunderstood me I'm not
[1:41:02] taking money out I'm putting money
[1:41:06] in oh we need your
[1:41:10] ID I said well if somebody else comes in
[1:41:12] here wanting to put money in my account
[1:41:14] don't you stop
[1:41:15] them cuz they cuz they ain't me
[1:41:27] well well think of
[1:41:29] it I wonder if you don't know who you
[1:41:32] are then they can't nothing can get put
[1:41:34] in your
[1:41:39] account God can't
[1:41:42] deposit in your spiritual account if you
[1:41:45] can't identify
[1:41:51] yourself am I yelling
[1:41:55] usually when I preach at myself I yell
[1:41:57] so my conver conviction don't stop me
[1:42:00] from
[1:42:03] preaching he says I want to take the
[1:42:06] subject this afternoon
[1:42:08] identification this is from the message
[1:42:10] identification around paragraph 14 and
[1:42:13] you can just listen he says now anyone
[1:42:16] that must be you're living in the days
[1:42:19] when identification is required
[1:42:24] you can't unless you know you're known
[1:42:28] at the bank you can't cash your check
[1:42:31] unless you have something to identify
[1:42:34] yourself I know my wife she can't cash a
[1:42:39] check I didn't hear a bunch of amens
[1:42:42] from the
[1:42:43] brothers he said she can't cash a check
[1:42:48] yet when we get our check we put it in
[1:42:51] the bank but she don't cash it because
[1:42:56] she doesn't drive she has no social
[1:43:00] security number or anything to identify
[1:43:03] herself so therefore it's hard anything
[1:43:08] for her to cash a check you've got to be
[1:43:12] some official
[1:43:15] identification and I think it's just
[1:43:18] what time that we're living in now so
[1:43:21] we're living in a time that
[1:43:24] identification is
[1:43:27] required okay so you have got to have a
[1:43:30] personal identification so we're not
[1:43:33] just talking we're not going to the
[1:43:35] Natural Bank we're going to the
[1:43:37] spiritual
[1:43:40] bank and if you're going to go to the
[1:43:42] spiritual bank and cash a
[1:43:47] promise right which the prophet of God
[1:43:50] typed to us a check
[1:43:54] right remember he said one group has the
[1:43:56] checks but they don't have no money he
[1:43:58] said the other group's got the money but
[1:44:00] they don't got no
[1:44:04] checks well I got the
[1:44:06] checks I got the money what am I
[1:44:10] lacking the
[1:44:15] identification I'm lacking the ability
[1:44:17] to go to that teller and prove to them
[1:44:22] who I am
[1:44:27] now think of
[1:44:30] it if the Rapture train pulled here
[1:44:33] you'd have to have a
[1:44:37] ticket you'd have to have some
[1:44:39] identification that that ticket belongs
[1:44:41] to you now I could and I don't want to
[1:44:44] get off track here but the tickets are
[1:44:48] so close it would deceive the very elect
[1:44:50] if possible
[1:44:54] so identification we're we're we're just
[1:44:56] talking about this because this is what
[1:44:58] we're talking about this morning
[1:45:00] discovering our identification let's
[1:45:02] move
[1:45:04] on he
[1:45:06] said if you notice if we go into a
[1:45:08] certain denominational Church like a
[1:45:10] Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran or
[1:45:12] something you have to have something to
[1:45:14] identify yourself if you're going to
[1:45:17] speak you have to have a credential or a
[1:45:20] card or a fellowship card or something
[1:45:23] to identify yourself as where they know
[1:45:26] where you come from and what you're
[1:45:29] going to say at that platform you have
[1:45:33] to be identified and it's the the
[1:45:38] identifying age it's the identifying age
[1:45:43] so you understand the spirit of God is
[1:45:47] here for us to discover our
[1:45:51] identity because this this is the
[1:45:53] identifying age now I'm not talking
[1:45:56] about discovering what we
[1:46:00] believe we've already been through that
[1:46:03] right the first thing we discovered that
[1:46:04] God sent a prophet Malachi 4:5 the
[1:46:07] second thing we discovered we discovered
[1:46:10] uh uh what we
[1:46:13] believe we got a prophet then we found
[1:46:16] out we didn't cut our hair then we found
[1:46:18] out that we we wore dresses then we
[1:46:20] found out that we didn't wear high heels
[1:46:22] some some of us haven't found that out
[1:46:24] yet keep reading keep listening you'll
[1:46:27] get out of those weener tight dresses
[1:46:29] and you'll get off of those high
[1:46:33] heels right that okay did I say that
[1:46:38] with
[1:46:41] love you'll Discover
[1:46:45] it no reason to condemn you if you don't
[1:46:48] know but when you know when you hear it
[1:46:52] just do it fly the
[1:46:55] token so th this is the identifying
[1:46:59] age now all that happens in the natural
[1:47:04] only types what's going on in the
[1:47:07] spiritual we also the Christian Church
[1:47:10] itself which is no
[1:47:13] denomination but of a nature it's the
[1:47:16] mystical Body of Christ and it's
[1:47:19] identified
[1:47:21] also so we know when this age that this
[1:47:24] body is going to be
[1:47:27] identified and she's going to have an
[1:47:34] identification now we can't go farther
[1:47:36] until we solve this
[1:47:38] issue that's why there's the confusion
[1:47:41] today the church is some are trying to
[1:47:43] say the church is identified by
[1:47:47] gifts sometimes the church is trying to
[1:47:49] say it's identified by knowledge some
[1:47:52] people think the church is identified by
[1:47:58] order no the church is identified by
[1:48:04] him you get you you get lost in the
[1:48:09] politics forget the
[1:48:12] politics it's an individual
[1:48:18] Affair not only do you got to know who
[1:48:21] you are
[1:48:24] right but there's a difference in
[1:48:26] knowing who you are and to be able to
[1:48:28] identify
[1:48:32] yourself this is who I am well give me
[1:48:35] your identification card they take it
[1:48:38] and they look at it and they look at you
[1:48:41] and they look at oh this looks like you
[1:48:45] duh it's my
[1:48:48] identification I wonder if we look like
[1:48:51] Christians
[1:49:00] it's only a type of the
[1:49:03] spiritual so I want you to understand
[1:49:06] that this is a happening that is
[1:49:08] transpiring within the church I I want
[1:49:12] to try to move I'll just try to do the
[1:49:14] best I
[1:49:16] can so it Bears
[1:49:19] identification Jesus identifies himself
[1:49:22] so the the church is identified by him
[1:49:25] and he said we're going to speak on that
[1:49:26] tomorrow after afternoon okay and so we
[1:49:31] we see that that
[1:49:32] identification is so perfect and God and
[1:49:38] then see it comes down and the character
[1:49:41] of God was Christ and he was a
[1:49:44] reflection he he was God made visible
[1:49:48] notice God made Vis visible
[1:49:52] so that Jesus was identity was God made
[1:49:57] visible he was the identification of God
[1:50:01] he was the personality we read reread
[1:50:04] that he was the person of God he was the
[1:50:07] attributes of God that's what he was he
[1:50:10] was God made
[1:50:11] tangible now you know a lot of times we
[1:50:14] say the Bible is the word of God well
[1:50:18] that is true he said but the Bible is
[1:50:22] just a recording of the thoughts of
[1:50:26] God that's what the Bible is it's a
[1:50:28] recording of the thoughts of God and and
[1:50:33] it's the
[1:50:34] testimony of those thoughts
[1:50:38] manifested so that's what it is it's the
[1:50:41] it's the thoughts of God we say well
[1:50:43] this is the word of God no this is a
[1:50:45] recorded word of God look it was spoken
[1:50:48] before it was
[1:50:50] written and before it was spoken spoken
[1:50:53] it was
[1:50:54] thought and that's where you were you
[1:50:56] were in the thoughts of God and so in
[1:51:01] one Essence this becomes your identity
[1:51:04] because you're the thoughts of God
[1:51:06] expressed and this book is the testimony
[1:51:09] or the recording of the thoughts of God
[1:51:12] and it's a history and and a testimony
[1:51:16] of those thoughts coming to
[1:51:20] pass so we can see it so therefore it
[1:51:22] became what
[1:51:25] tangible you are the a tangible identity
[1:51:29] of God we got to move it out of our
[1:51:32] minds into our
[1:51:37] flesh where I can say I handled I
[1:51:40] touched I felt the Living Word of God oh
[1:51:46] my if I ever grab you one day and just
[1:51:48] hold on to you you see what you doing
[1:51:50] brother because I'm feeling the word of
[1:51:51] God I'm touching it it's tangible it's
[1:51:55] right here it's in you Christ the hope
[1:51:58] of glory Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:52:03] the same spirit that was in him is in
[1:52:05] you and it's going to Quicken your
[1:52:07] mortal bodies oh we we got an identity
[1:52:11] we're starting to search and find out
[1:52:13] who we are he
[1:52:16] says in the beginning was God and he
[1:52:20] wasn't even God then he just an object
[1:52:22] of mercury only thing was he was eternal
[1:52:26] and in him was attributes and those
[1:52:27] attributes were thoughts and those
[1:52:29] thoughts were expressed the words and
[1:52:32] the Word was made
[1:52:35] manifest so that's that's what I just
[1:52:38] quoted you in my interpretation of that
[1:52:41] what is it it's all God being
[1:52:44] tangible and you are a part of
[1:52:48] God it's all God being
[1:52:55] tangible now our our identity is
[1:52:58] starting to change from what we believe
[1:53:01] to what we are we are the
[1:53:05] tangible part of God for our age for our
[1:53:10] time this is God in our
[1:53:15] time the tangible living bride of Jesus
[1:53:20] Christ tangible
[1:53:22] not setting apart here in a
[1:53:27] book not setting apart in a
[1:53:31] tape remember a while back I preached
[1:53:34] that church had no book Bible no tape
[1:53:37] without book or without Bible why
[1:53:41] because they had an identity they were
[1:53:43] the tangible am word made manifested in
[1:53:49] their
[1:53:50] age so we're we're trying to to get away
[1:53:53] from everything being
[1:53:56] philosophical and being
[1:53:58] mental to where it comes and becomes
[1:54:01] flesh and
[1:54:05] reality and that's not a preacher
[1:54:11] thing okay it's not me here talking in
[1:54:15] elegant words that you can't understand
[1:54:19] there's no big eyes or little 's I might
[1:54:23] be a voice piece this morning or or
[1:54:26] speaking from my heart to you but you
[1:54:30] are the
[1:54:32] reality of the spoken word of God for
[1:54:36] this
[1:54:37] age you've got to come to your
[1:54:41] identification of what you
[1:54:47] are not only who you are but what's your
[1:54:49] identity
[1:54:53] you got to be able to position yourself
[1:54:55] and place yourself and say this is now
[1:54:59] now now I know my
[1:55:02] identity now if I understand that I'm
[1:55:05] the
[1:55:06] tangible word I was what was in his
[1:55:09] thoughts I was predestinated to become
[1:55:12] flesh I here in this day I am that word
[1:55:16] I believe that word and that's settled
[1:55:18] in your heart then you can walk to the
[1:55:21] bank
[1:55:23] who are you I'm the Son of
[1:55:27] God what
[1:55:30] yeah what's your identification he
[1:55:33] identified me in his
[1:55:37] word he gave me a word to believe and I
[1:55:40] believe
[1:55:44] it once once that
[1:55:47] settled you're not struggling with I'm a
[1:55:49] sinner I'm a saint I'm a sinner I'm a
[1:55:51] saint I'm a Sinner and I'm a saint in
[1:55:54] and out up and down in and out up and
[1:55:57] down you say well what do I do with the
[1:56:00] sin that's in my life if you can get
[1:56:01] your
[1:56:03] identity then you have power over him
[1:56:07] you can say get behind me
[1:56:11] Satan but as long as you're in the
[1:56:14] battle of the
[1:56:18] claim right Satan say You're Mine Jesus
[1:56:22] say in your
[1:56:24] mind and and one day you do a little
[1:56:26] wrong and you you I belong to Satan
[1:56:29] today and then you don't like belonging
[1:56:32] to
[1:56:33] Satan so you go repent and everything
[1:56:36] and now you belong to
[1:56:40] Jesus
[1:56:41] no he don't even
[1:56:44] know he already threw all that stuff
[1:56:47] Satan's getting you do in the sea of
[1:56:50] forgetfulness the only reason you don't
[1:56:52] don't shut them off is you don't think
[1:56:53] you have the identity to do
[1:56:55] it that's
[1:56:58] right he's got you
[1:57:00] convinced that you're not one of
[1:57:07] them and if you don't settle that
[1:57:11] issue he'll be bothering you and having
[1:57:14] an effect on you but once that issue is
[1:57:18] settled he will bother you but he'll
[1:57:20] have no effect
[1:57:30] I I want to I hope I can do it my
[1:57:33] inability to just draw such that
[1:57:37] difference he
[1:57:40] says he says what is it it's all God
[1:57:45] becoming tangible and you're a part of
[1:57:48] God Jesus come to redeem those that was
[1:57:51] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:57:54] the foundation of the world it was in
[1:57:56] God's thoughts and that's what he come
[1:57:59] to redeem and them as soon as it strikes
[1:58:04] to them they see it because the life is
[1:58:09] in
[1:58:11] there that's another sermon in itself
[1:58:14] but if the life isn't there then what
[1:58:17] can they do see they don't see it
[1:58:21] they'll never see it it the whole thing
[1:58:24] as Jesus said as it at that day you'll
[1:58:28] know that I am in the Father the father
[1:58:31] in me and I in you and you in me the
[1:58:36] whole thing is God becoming
[1:58:42] material like a husband and wife
[1:58:45] becoming one together God and his church
[1:58:48] becoming one so that's the whole purpose
[1:58:51] here that's what he's trying to identify
[1:58:54] we're not here living we're not here
[1:58:57] living and trying to get enough works to
[1:59:00] get to the throne and plead our
[1:59:05] case that's not our
[1:59:07] identification that's not what we're
[1:59:10] about that's not who we are that's not
[1:59:13] the program we're in I'm not in the
[1:59:16] reprogram of repent repent repent repent
[1:59:19] I'm a sinner I'm a sinner I'm a sinner
[1:59:21] I'm a Son of
[1:59:25] God and if sin Reigns in this body I
[1:59:28] will
[1:59:30] overcome because I'm an
[1:59:35] [Applause]
[1:59:39] overcomer but I got to lay my claim to
[1:59:43] my identity before I can lay claim to my
[1:59:47] possession Hallelujah
[1:59:49] [Applause]
[1:59:54] and if we're going to struggle with
[1:59:57] that we're going to struggle whether we
[2:00:00] have a right to be healed or why am I
[2:00:02] sick you know why you're sick because
[2:00:03] there's a
[2:00:05] devil you know why you're sick so God
[2:00:07] can manifest his attribute you know why
[2:00:10] you're sick so God cont test
[2:00:12] you and prove you it don't mean
[2:00:19] nothing oh if you weren't
[2:00:23] sick if you didn't have to struggle with
[2:00:25] your blood if you didn't have this oh
[2:00:27] what would you be you know what I'd be
[2:00:28] I'd be maybe a way too proud maybe way
[2:00:32] too arrogant Paul said he put this Thorn
[2:00:35] In My Flesh to Buffet me that I wouldn't
[2:00:37] exalt myself above
[2:00:44] measure oh that word has got to become
[2:00:47] real to us
[2:01:00] to
[2:01:05] think that the man was made in the image
[2:01:08] of his
[2:01:10] creator and was given a wall to stand
[2:01:15] behind that that word could never fail
[2:01:22] that's the Christian's
[2:01:25] hope it's his shield it's his armor it's
[2:01:29] the Rock today is to stay behind the
[2:01:33] word every
[2:01:35] believer now you must never get from
[2:01:38] behind that when you do you open the
[2:01:42] door to the
[2:01:43] enemy when they say oh well you can do a
[2:01:47] little of this and a little of that God
[2:01:50] wants you to separate yourself from
[2:01:53] everything that's called sin completely
[2:01:57] set aside for him and for him
[2:02:02] alone now that's a hard
[2:02:09] thing sin is
[2:02:11] unbelief sin is to know to do the will
[2:02:15] of God and not to do
[2:02:19] it it's not all based on the sin in the
[2:02:23] garden the fleshly desires there's a lot
[2:02:26] of sins in the mind that are a lot worse
[2:02:29] than the sins in the
[2:02:32] body when you stay back and God speaks
[2:02:35] to you and speaks to you and speaks to
[2:02:37] you and you won't go further than God
[2:02:40] you won't try to become any more
[2:02:41] spiritual you won't try to change your
[2:02:44] character you won't try to move up
[2:02:46] that's worse than in God's sight this
[2:02:48] you sat on a bar stool with a woman
[2:02:54] just to turn his spet
[2:02:57] off to to to deny the
[2:03:02] transforming power of God and God's
[2:03:06] ability to transform
[2:03:12] you you say are you transformed I don't
[2:03:14] care if I'm transformed if I can know
[2:03:17] for a fact that I'm identified as a
[2:03:22] transplant
[2:03:25] recipient then God will put that take
[2:03:29] that Stony heart out of me and put in a
[2:03:31] fleshly heart if I know the seeds there
[2:03:36] and I can identify that seeds in me then
[2:03:39] I know that that seed has the power to
[2:03:41] transform me I'm not going to transform
[2:03:44] myself and then look back and discover
[2:03:47] the seed
[2:03:52] the whole journey is the
[2:03:56] characteristic that might have went over
[2:03:58] some heads but that's
[2:04:02] okay maybe that was for
[2:04:06] me now you
[2:04:10] might you must never get from behind
[2:04:13] that okay he says he has a purpose in
[2:04:18] your
[2:04:19] life each individual
[2:04:22] that no one else on the face of the
[2:04:25] Earth can take your
[2:04:31] place okay that's why it's not a group
[2:04:35] thing that's why the prophet of God said
[2:04:37] there's two types of spirit there's the
[2:04:39] church spirit and there's the spirit of
[2:04:42] God the church spirit is we're going to
[2:04:44] do it as a
[2:04:46] group the spirit of God is Christ in me
[2:04:50] the hope of glory
[2:04:54] amen God has got something for
[2:04:58] you you're made like
[2:05:02] that you're made like that you're made
[2:05:05] to get what God's got for you what God's
[2:05:10] got for you becomes your
[2:05:15] identity that's
[2:05:17] right amen not a great big blanket thing
[2:05:20] out here
[2:05:22] okay it's personal it's individual God's
[2:05:26] got something for you you've you're made
[2:05:29] like that you you was did that way for a
[2:05:34] purpose God is Sovereign in his Works
[2:05:38] things differ we differ one from
[2:05:42] another we notice animals we find out
[2:05:46] that animal life there's one animal and
[2:05:50] one's a beast of burden horses does work
[2:05:53] cows sacrifice Lions the great Tigers
[2:05:57] roam without any labor or anything he
[2:06:02] made the great big
[2:06:04] animals like elephants he made a little
[2:06:07] bitty fellow like a mouse and you know
[2:06:11] there's they tell God what to do and how
[2:06:14] to do it he does it his own
[2:06:18] way he makes mountains he makes deserts
[2:06:20] and everything
[2:06:22] okay you are as equal in creation as a
[2:06:30] mountain he makes men different he gives
[2:06:34] us each one a different place a palm
[2:06:37] tree can never be a hickory a hickory
[2:06:39] tree can never be a palm nobody can take
[2:06:42] your place you shouldn't try to take
[2:06:46] anybody else's place
[2:06:54] because you are an
[2:06:58] individual to
[2:07:00] God and God has a purpose for you he
[2:07:04] made you thus you say why did he do it
[2:07:09] he's Sovereign he's got a reason for it
[2:07:13] being that
[2:07:18] way he made you the Way You Are your
[2:07:22] weaknesses your struggles your mind
[2:07:24] battles he knows all about it he's
[2:07:26] trying to get you to discover
[2:07:31] something to
[2:07:33] discover yeah I go through all this
[2:07:37] stuff all of it's got a purpose but yet
[2:07:41] he's got something for
[2:07:43] me he's got something for me to do he's
[2:07:47] got something that I'm supposed to
[2:07:49] be that's what I I need to discover I
[2:07:54] need to discover my identity in
[2:07:58] him to be known in his word the same way
[2:08:02] I'm known on my driver's
[2:08:07] license but we find
[2:08:10] out that we'll
[2:08:12] all we he said but we find out that
[2:08:16] we're all guarded by the
[2:08:19] word in heaven we have celestial bodies
[2:08:23] the Bible says that every one star
[2:08:26] differs from another there's a Cyrus and
[2:08:30] the different ones and Mars and Jupiter
[2:08:33] and all those different ones they differ
[2:08:35] one from another the sun differs from
[2:08:37] the Moon and the moon from the stars
[2:08:40] there is Angels such as there is sarapin
[2:08:44] and chapins and angels and great angels
[2:08:48] in the in degrees and even in the New
[2:08:51] World world to come the king of Earth
[2:08:54] will bring their honor into the
[2:08:56] city just
[2:08:59] think they're they're different right
[2:09:02] but but what's their honor their honor
[2:09:06] is their
[2:09:07] identity that's their
[2:09:10] honor that God made me thus that's my
[2:09:15] crown this is the way God made me
[2:09:18] Christianity's got off on this this
[2:09:21] whole journey of they have a clone idea
[2:09:25] of
[2:09:27] Christianity and you're all supposed to
[2:09:29] be beaten into this mold by
[2:09:36] preachers it's never that way it's an
[2:09:38] individual
[2:09:41] Affair it's got to be working in
[2:09:47] you you got to oh I don't have the words
[2:09:52] to express how perfect you are in his
[2:09:56] sight and how that he wants to get each
[2:09:59] one of us and have us find and discover
[2:10:04] what he put us here he started it with
[2:10:07] the age he started it with the churches
[2:10:10] and he's bringing it down he opened the
[2:10:12] seals and now it's coming down to you
[2:10:15] finding your Eternal identity in him
[2:10:20] where you were in in his mind in the
[2:10:23] beginning he's starting to reveal that
[2:10:27] if you're
[2:10:30] interested if you're not
[2:10:41] interested he says we're always going to
[2:10:44] be that way because God is not a Sears
[2:10:48] and robok Harmony House
[2:10:52] he is a god of variety he makes one one
[2:10:56] way and one another but we must serve
[2:11:00] him in the way that God made
[2:11:05] us and be
[2:11:07] glad and stay behind his word and that's
[2:11:12] the way God did
[2:11:16] it
[2:11:18] wow okay you you know what people try to
[2:11:21] do
[2:11:22] they try to take the gifts and take the
[2:11:26] personality out of it that's what
[2:11:28] Pentecost did we all speak in tongues we
[2:11:32] all got the Holy Ghost it ain't we
[2:11:35] all it's you all but not we
[2:11:42] all it's
[2:11:45] you you're a Mystic living in a world of
[2:11:48] your own
[2:11:52] power beyond all things and I want to
[2:11:55] close with this last
[2:12:00] statement I now identified in the
[2:12:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost not something
[2:12:05] out here on the street something 40
[2:12:08] years ago I have it right now the glory
[2:12:13] and power of God of the Forgiveness of
[2:12:19] sins I see him heal the sick open the
[2:12:23] blind eyes see him foretell things read
[2:12:27] the
[2:12:28] hearts of the people I'm identified with
[2:12:32] him in his ministry at this day glory to
[2:12:38] God I'm identified with him for
[2:12:41] deliverance in this last days I trust to
[2:12:45] be a part of that great bride that's
[2:12:48] coming some of these days
[2:12:54] he is making a
[2:12:57] bride yes sir he's hewing and chipping
[2:13:01] now chopping off the world oh Church
[2:13:06] joining and Creeds and denominations and
[2:13:11] dogmas all has to be cut away from the
[2:13:15] church their formal ideas their
[2:13:19] indifferences their do doctrines and
[2:13:22] things come back and let the master pick
[2:13:26] up the bow let the master pick you up in
[2:13:30] his hands and strike the word say Jesus
[2:13:34] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:13:38] forever say Amen Lord Make Me mold me
[2:13:43] make me Lord what I should be and then
[2:13:49] there will be a
[2:13:51] different
[2:13:58] thing give me my
[2:14:01] identity you know the story about the
[2:14:04] violin that came up for
[2:14:07] auction and they put the violin up for
[2:14:10] auction and some guy offered
[2:14:12] $10
[2:14:15] $15 probably a strat of ear or something
[2:14:18] that nobody even knew about
[2:14:21] and then somebody came up and took that
[2:14:25] violin and started playing
[2:14:30] it its
[2:14:32] identity was
[2:14:35] there but it was
[2:14:41] undiscovered they didn't know what it
[2:14:44] was they had no way of doing it but when
[2:14:46] the master got a hold of it and he
[2:14:49] started playing it
[2:14:52] and he started running that up and down
[2:14:54] the strings people couldn't help it they
[2:14:56] they started to
[2:14:58] cry I know that feeling I I heard one of
[2:15:01] the greatest uh cello players play and
[2:15:06] he made that cello
[2:15:08] cry I mean
[2:15:11] emotionally it actually seemed to
[2:15:14] penetrate my
[2:15:18] feelings and I believe in Emotion
[2:15:22] I believe in being happy in the
[2:15:25] Lord I believe in rejoicing in the power
[2:15:28] of the
[2:15:29] spirit but a man can't play
[2:15:34] that only he can play
[2:15:37] that man can't conduct that only he can
[2:15:41] conduct it if that guy didn't have the
[2:15:44] ability to make that violin sound like
[2:15:47] what it was really made to sound like
[2:15:51] nobody would ever heard it for what it
[2:15:53] is and if God don't play you the world
[2:15:58] will never know the gospel the way that
[2:16:00] it's really meant to be
[2:16:07] known men and women set
[2:16:12] apart living righteously with the love
[2:16:16] of God spread AB abroad in their heart
[2:16:20] by the holy
[2:16:22] Spirit I'm not condemning you this
[2:16:24] morning if you're sin I'm not condemning
[2:16:26] you if you're smoking I'm not condemning
[2:16:29] if you're lusting I there's no
[2:16:31] condemnation in this message I'm just
[2:16:34] telling you that the master can get your
[2:16:37] life and play you
[2:16:41] [Applause]
[2:16:45] different you don't have to keep playing
[2:16:48] that same score on

[2:16:56] sheet discover he's got something
[2:16:59] different for you to
[2:17:00] live you're not living for
[2:17:03] judgment you won't even come into the
[2:17:08] Judgment then why live below our
[2:17:10] privilege why don't we grab and find out
[2:17:13] and discover what's God got for me to do
[2:17:16] he's got something for me to do he's got
[2:17:19] some way for me to be
[2:17:23] we don't need Pulpit preachers we got
[2:17:25] too many of them we need life preachers
[2:17:29] we need people that are shining lights
[2:17:32] out in the world filled with the power
[2:17:34] of the Holy Ghost crying out for lost
[2:17:37] souls being played by the
[2:17:43] master what we need yes

[2:18:42] the son another
[2:18:45] Masterpiece part of the word the word
[2:18:49] Jesus couldn't take
[2:18:52] the
[2:18:55] place you remember when they read in the
[2:19:00] day in the book he read just the part of
[2:19:04] the
[2:19:04] prophecy let the rest of it for the last
[2:19:08] day were supposed to take that

[2:19:52] do and if I maybe he wants you to sit on
[2:19:55] a church bench I'd walk in there and sit
[2:19:57] in that church bench and just take
[2:19:59] possession of
[2:20:01] that
[2:20:02] spot I'm here to hear the word of God
[2:20:05] I'm here to praise God I'm here to shout
[2:20:08] amen I'm here to worship and raise my
[2:20:11] hands I'm going to create an atmosphere
[2:20:13] around me that that sinner is either

[2:20:18] altar one or the other something's
[2:20:20] fixtion to happen he's here he's in me

[2:21:10] not part of a church not part of an
[2:21:12] anation but the part of him hewed out of
[2:21:17] any other kind of form won't work

[2:22:53] Christ be in us if you're not ready
[2:22:58] truly saved in the body and the word of
[2:23:02] God in you and reflecting itself and the
[2:23:06] life of Christ reflecting out of you

[2:23:16] experience you have let that word
[2:23:19] reflect through through you each day
[2:23:22] because God in this last day is taking a
[2:23:25] bride for his son Jesus
[2:23:29] [Applause]
[2:23:42] Christ that may need
[2:23:45] funding right if you have an
[2:23:48] idea or you've got got
[2:23:52] something but you don't have no money to
[2:23:55] fund it it'll never go
[2:23:58] nowhere you got to go borrow
[2:24:01] money and then they want a percentage of
[2:24:04] it so you share your idea you share your
[2:24:07] investment yes it'll it'll remain yours
[2:24:11] alone a lot of people have taken a lot
[2:24:15] of good ideas to the Grave with them
[2:24:19] because they were too proud PR to get
[2:24:22] the funding
[2:24:24] necessary well God's got a bride that
[2:24:27] needs funding but he provides the
[2:24:31] funding no
[2:24:33] interest
[2:24:35] free and he doesn't just fund
[2:24:39] you your idea he funds his
[2:24:44] idea of
[2:24:46] you and it's his spirit
[2:24:50] it's his word talking to you and you
[2:24:53] have access to that
[2:24:57] Spirit nobody can say this is the
[2:25:00] evidence of it or that's the evidence of
[2:25:02] it the evidence of the spirit in you is
[2:25:06] Jesus Christ the word coming to
[2:25:11] life in the way that he made it to come
[2:25:17] to pass in you there's no clone
