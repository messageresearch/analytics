you have your bibles we're just going to read a continuation romans and uh and it it ties back to what we've talked about this morning as we listen to our messenger and we're gonna just let's just go uh listen to i think 19 more minutes or so and uh go right into communion so we won't uh really preach tonight but we will feast amen so let's read in the eighth chapter and this has kind of been the theme throughout our easter seal it says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you so now let's just read this next little part in the context of everything that we've been talking about there for brethren we are not deaders not to the flesh to live after the flesh so we have no debt to the flesh everything in the flesh has been taken care of we have no obligations to the flesh our obligations are to the word then listen to how beautiful this is for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live now this is a great scripture in the context for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated um so this morning we just listened to about how the prophet uh told us that we had to be free from our fear and and in order to go forward and then we talked a little bit about the real eagle goes up and he he soars into the heavenly and gets that food up right for himself that he can just feast on that manna and then we talk a little bit about the atmosphere and as we talked about things about leadership and that's what happens when you soar into that man and you get that food you get the leadership of the holy spirit and it says that's the sons and daughters of god so we certainly marked out as he was pointing out to the people here was the very lord himself standing in their midst veiled in the ministry of a prophet doing signs and wonders and the spirits beckoning them to come and yet they choose to hold on to their traditions you know it's it's kind of heartbreaking in one spot but i think as you listen to this next little portion it'll bless you because now he starts going over and talking about the riches and the understanding the believer gets about the rapture and the resurrection and life and uh and how that i i just love in here how he talks that don't worry that quickening power is still with you when you die it doesn't hide it so let's just listen to these few minutes and enjoy it and we'll go right into communion god bless you tonight tablets are our phones are some sort of electronic device i don't know i wonder what the gospel day jesus was here on earth huh can you imagine the gnashing and wailing of teeth that would be going on with him doing the great you know brother braham came right at the perfect time didn't he god planting just perfect before the world would have totally rejected them god bless you now let's take some people again let's take some of the old testament prophets see what they did let's look first at stevens how stephen's in the midst of that sanhedrin council when that council brought him up there that great assembly of believers they're supposed to be believers brought him up and tried to condemn him why he said you stiff necks uncircumcising heart and ears you always resist the holy ghost that's that eternal life is your father's getting back in here through the prophets so are you doing it today and they matched up on him with their teeth they didn't want to hear that he is against their creed is against their denomination and they stoned the man to death and he raised his hands up in the torch heaven said i see heavens open and jesus stands in right side why he had the resurrection quickening power in him that took him into the bosoms of jesus notice quickly now look at philip down there in the great revival having a revival would have been embarrassing for any man while we had a god of big cooperation amongst the churches and everything down there is having a great revival and the quickening power of god spoke to him stevens may have said this you're having a great revival but i got one man i want you to talk to and steven's obedient no matter what it is how much criticism oh stevens you can't leave but i can god said so and he went out into the desert and out there he found this eunuch and what happened he said has uh if thou believers are the all thine heart that jesus is the son of god uh i'll baptize him when he baptized him look he was quickened by this quickening power to leave a revival of thousands of people to go out into the desert to one man oh that'd be against all reasons see why these ten thousand want you here but there's one wanting out there see and the quickening power sent him to god's provided place hallelujah men and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do the things that god wants you to do i don't care what somebody else says about the neighbors say well that person's lost their mind pray all night they read the bible i don't care what they say it's what god called you to do yeah that's right oh they say we can't have these old-fashioned pentecostal revivals like oh yes we can do you can have it in yourself and you are the majority in god no matter what the rest of them think notice after in obedience listen close now after obeying god to his word when he fulfilled his mission that quickening power that he received at pentecost caught him away quicken his body miles and miles away he was taken in the spirit and was found over in another country somewhere quickening power of god and if we be pentecostals that same power that raised up jesus from the dead if it dwells in your mortal bodies amen all right notice let's take another man with this quickly power there was a man way long ago by the name of enoch when a new thing come along with some come along and say well now we have to go back to the old school or this side of the other enoch walked with god amen whatever god said do he not never missed one word he walked with god what was he he was the son of god he was an eagle it had been called to that day and when come time he was so full of that quickening power remember he'd walk 500 years or more before god and not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself not one time did he do but kept the testimony everything that god told him to do he went and done it no argument about it he just wasn't done no matter what anybody else thought he wouldn't done it why he was full of that quickening power and when it come time for the old man to die god just sent out a letter and he walked up home he quickened him and took his mortal body up in a rapture amen that's that quickly power look at elijah after his work was finished on earth he was so full of that quickening power he'd condemn them jackie kennedy haircuts in his day he told old jesse about what he thought of her he told them preachers and priests what was right and wrong and they didn't believe him but he condemned them painted face women and things so bad and he's so full of that quickness power to nothing could harm him amen god had fed him in the heavens took him out and set him aside and he was so full of quickening power come time to die jordan opened up and he just walked sit down a chair and took him home so full of that quickening power he become a true genuine son of god notice he had a successor and his name was elisha and elisha had a double post in this quicken power see he had a double potion of it now he preached for about 80 years or he's not 80 years old he took sick and died now he didn't get to go home like elijah did see both of us represent there in the church some saints go in some resting but notice when elijah was taken up in the rapture then elisha went to sleep and god full of quitting power look at his prophecy just before he died see now let me show you i don't care if you're dead or where you're at that quickly power never leaves amen years and years after his death his meter rotted away the skin worms that eat it up but they were packing the dead man one day 30 men on that bones and there was so much quickening power there until a man come back to life again [Music] hallelujah raised him up from the dead because that quickening power that was up on that saint of god never left him stayed right on those bones oh remember we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones if we are his bride death won't bother that quickening power at all though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god amen glory to god i don't know what to say i don't hope for an old man like me knowing i see my end time right now younger soon that's 56 years old that's that's a little bitty boy i've stood here trying to proclaim this but i know that in me nothing good that i have nothing i've done but in me is that quickening power it quickened me one day from the things of the world as young man on the eternal life all the things that's happened i've seen visions foretold things he's never let nothing fail yet i've spoken other tongues i've prophesied i've done those things by the spirit of god that dwelts in me that's quitting power i know that someday my redeemer's living now and someday when he comes these bones shall rise again they're going to meet him in the air oh hallelujah you may fear me in the sea burn it up wherever you want to that quickening power is eternal i feel easter right now yes sir i've had it for years it's in me it's in you if you the spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it's quicken you from the things of the world to the word of god only that's it it's quickened you from this life to life eternal you were once dead in sin and trespasses has now been quickened together to set and play heavenly places with christ jesus feasting on manna from above seeing the hand of god made manifested prove the promise of this day as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man they were eating drinking mary given in mary and as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on earth not son of god no more son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the line not the ox and the sacrifice age see every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the religious power it went to meet the roman power and then when it come to sacrifice hour the ox went because he's a sacrificed beast of the lord then come the reformers down through the church ages come the face of a man and the reformers have been sentenced luther wesley hall calvin on down down pentecostal age but in the last message it went forth there come a flying eagle it's eagle time reveal time the word of god made manifest the word of god proved amen oh children walk into this baptism of the holy spirit come in and believe it with all your heart god will feel you looky here now we find now remember we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones as god raised his bones and flesh out of the grave they cannot hide the man that has the potential death cannot take him jesus said all the father has given me will come to me i'll raise him up at the last day amen oh my easter while we're right in easter when he raised we raised with him he sent the abstract back we hold it as the baptism of the holy ghost he is alive forevermore the same yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 proves that he's the same his messiah anointed once believed then what is the messiah what is a messiah messiah is anointed one and now if he was the messiah being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the only one for this day it's already raised with me in the resurrection because these two are one amen i wish i could tell you where i see it i wish i had the education i could do it with see i would i hope you see it i hope god the holy ghost comes down there and puts that in your heart to see what i mean the resurrection we are now in the resurrection we are sitting with him in the resurrection but only those who have life not those who do not have life they won't know it they'll never know it he'll go right on thinking they're getting the holy ghost being saved and the rapture will be over with and gone said elias has already come and they did that and you knew it not see notice this does not stop the quickening power of god notice death can't stop it you say well my mother was a spirit-filled woman my daddy i never seen a man so full of the power of my daddy but he died brother branham sure that didn't stop the quickening power moses had that quickly power you believe that there never was a man like him on the earth until jesus for he didn't only see visions he talked face to face with god even a prophetess maryam disputed his word one day he said don't you fear god consider my servant moses not nobody in the world like him this hour there's never been anybody like moses i speak to moses what did he ever say it wasn't truth see i speak to moses don't you fear god don't you say a word against him and right then she was stricken with leprosy and it was dying she didn't live very long afterwards moses prayed for and moses climbed up on the mountain at 120 years of ministry or 80 years of ministry 120 years of life climbed up on the mountains and died and was buried in the valley but that quickening power was on him about 800 years later here you stand on my transfiguration amen why was he he was included in that resurrection sure he was he had the quickening power of god here was standing lookie job abraham isaac the saints on the day of the resurrection that great morning that job and all of them knew that would come when he said i know my redeemer liveth hundreds and hundreds of years before christ it's actually the book of job was wrote before genesis it claimed and the oldest book in the bible and in his trials and like we go through now and his wife even the closest thing to him on earth so won't you curse god and die to death he said thou speak us like a foolish woman the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord and then when the spirit of god come upon him and he began to prophesy said i know my redeemer liveth and the last days he'll stand upon this earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet my flesh shall i see god and he made a place to bury himself he said if i buy this ground he's bought there and buried himself later on come a man named abraham the church growing coming on up abraham well now he had the potentials of god too everlasting life eternal because god called him i noticed when he died or sarah died he bought a piece of ground in palestine near job's grave and buried sarah abraham died and also was buried with sarah abraham begot a god isaac and isaac when he died he slept with abraham in the same portion of ground now when isaac begot jacob jacob died way down in egypt but being a prophet now with his potential this quickening power he said don't you bury me down here joseph come here my prophet son put your hand upon this hip that god crippled thank you swear to the god of heaven you'll not bury me down here what was in that man why wasn't egypt just as good as any place he was a prophet amen you know where that resurrection is going to be what's going to be in egypt in palestine said put your hands up on my crippled hip can you swear by the god that i've served you're my prophet son that you'll not bury my bones down here take me up honor and bear me joseph being a prophet also laid his hands upon his crippled daddy said i swear to the god of abraham behind the kingdom of jacob how not bury you here they talking about bearing him up in that land why why when joseph died he said don't you bury me down here don't bury me down here why god's got everywhere but he has a plan joseph was a prophet he said someday listen to his words the lord god will reveal we'll visit you and we'll take you out of this land and when you go you take my bones amen that quickly power was in that bone oh we have the spirit of him that raised up christ in the dead dwelling hallelujah he'll also quicken your mortal bodies don't put my bones down here bury them up there but those are the promise when jesus come here i've got a scripture here matthew 27 51 when jesus raised from the dead job seen that coming said i know my redeemer liveth the last days he'll stand upon this earth though the skin worms has destroyed this body yet my flesh shall see god i'll see him they know that was a prophet abraham was a prophet isaac was a prophet jacob was a prophet joseph was a prophet and they had the revelation of god according to his word amen on that easter morning when that one came and redeemed all those who believed on him they raised two according to the bible that quickening power come into the grave of job where there wasn't even a spoonful of the dust of his bones left after almost hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years his bones had decayed it went back and turned back to the gases of the earth just a mere ash dust lay there but yet when that's quickening power according to the word of god to the promise hundreds and hundreds yes thousands of years later when that quickly power was brought forth in the grave job abraham isaac jacob hollam come out of the grave with him the bible said so saint matthew 27 chapter 15 first verse it said many of the saints that slept in the dusty earth resurrected it come out of the graves with him when he come up on easter morning why they had that potential they had that quickening power see and raised up from the dead and went with him in the resurrection enjoyed the resurrection with him because they were full of that quickening power they had that genuine easter seal where they say i would shall lay back the old testament wait a minute in first thessalonians the fourth chapter the 16th verse oh she read that i would not have you ignored brethren concerning those that sleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again the third day not make belief but we believe it even so them that sleep in him shall god bring with him the new testament saints with that quickening power shall resurrect also at his second coming just as sure as the old testament saints with all that quickly power in their bones and translations and powers and so forth that showed of god that prophets who the word of god came to they resurrected with him on that resurrection morning and with the promise of god that everyone that's in christ jesus will also come with him in his resurrection the quickening power of god upon the bones no wonder we lay hands on the sick no wonder we love one another we are brothers and sisters we shouldn't hate one another because we're corrected by the word of god we should love one another and have respects for one another you know if you don't it won't help you amen that's a good quote to have communion on amen let's stand together and let's turn over in our bible let's read the communion out of the out of luke the 22nd chapter and the 19th verse of luke another accounting of the communion service that the brothers would get the communion ready this evening all that some wonderful things there of what god was doing it's beautiful make sure i have the right spot here let's start with the 15th verse there and it says and he said unto them with desire have i desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god and he took a cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves. for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave it unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me and likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man whom he is betrayed amen our gracious heavenly father we read in the record of luke father the institution of the great communion and father we also read in corinthians how that paul by inspiration reestablished this amongst the gentiles that they too would break this bread and bless this wine and eat it in remembrance of you for your body is meat indeed father and your life is truly quickening life and we just ask you to bless it today for us to communion in jesus precious name we pray amen brothers with communion pray our gracious heavenly father this bread representing father your body lord the body of sacrifice for all of our sins that the stripes that you took upon yourself father merited healing for whoever would believe it and we're so grateful for that we ask you to bless us to us tonight in communion heavenly father also the cups that represent lord the blood that you shed father in the life of that blood returning back on the believer heavenly father we ask that you bless it to us tonight in jesus precious name we pray
