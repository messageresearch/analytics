[14:26] open our service in prayer and our Psalm
[14:29] reading this morning amen
[14:31] [Music]
[14:41] and welcome to the house of the Lord
[14:44] thankful that we have his word to rely
[14:47] on and
[14:49] in obedience to his word we've not
[14:51] forsaken to assemble ourselves together
[14:56] and realize it's by his promise that
[14:58] he's to meet us here
[15:02] we have to set our hearts
[15:04] to know that
[15:06] we won't leave here the same person that
[15:09] we want to be determined to be closer to
[15:12] the Lord and have benefits from the word
[15:15] being open for before us singing the
[15:17] songs of praise surely delivering our
[15:19] hearts and worship to him surely
[15:22] but the word of God
[15:25] it's quicker and sharper than any
[15:27] two-headed sword
[15:29] it'll discern what we have need of today
[15:32] and he's here to provide it
[15:34] let's just go the Lord in prayer
[15:36] [Music]
[15:37] our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we
[15:39] thank you Lord once again
[15:42] to the beautiful sunshine of this day
[15:43] Lord we're able to gather together
[15:46] Lord we pray would be in unity in one
[15:48] Accord one mind one purpose Lord that is
[15:52] to give you the preeminence
[15:54] and Lord It's not the issue in life that
[15:57] we're rejoicing in this morning
[16:00] but it's ESO in life
[16:04] Lord we're thankful for the gift that
[16:07] just keeps on giving Lord
[16:09] Lord so many times a holiday season
[16:13] we remark and
[16:16] amazed at how little Credence is given
[16:18] to the to the gift that was given maybe
[16:21] a few hours a day a week
[16:23] they're thankful
[16:25] but Lord truly
[16:27] there's a people Lord that you're
[16:29] sustaining you're quickening their life
[16:31] by your life Lord that we lean on you
[16:34] and you're this rock in a weary land
[16:37] Lord that's where we're going this
[16:39] morning that's we have desire to
[16:42] to rest upon
[16:44] is that cleft in the Rock today Lord is
[16:46] still a provision you're still on The
[16:48] Mercy Seat you're still a Healer you're
[16:50] still a savior Lord we need all these
[16:53] things sustain us we pray preserve Us by
[16:56] Your Word Lord as we look into this
[16:58] portion of your word pray that you'll be
[17:00] a blessing to each one that hears it
[17:02] Lord
[17:03] may you just prepare our hearts for the
[17:05] the later preaching Lord that it may
[17:07] fall on fertile ground you can water it
[17:09] with this your spirit Lord and spring up
[17:11] to everlasting life
[17:13] Grant it to us today Lord
[17:15] we look to you now in the name of the
[17:17] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen
[17:19] we're going to read from Psalm 121 this
[17:22] morning just a very short reading
[17:25] um
[17:27] and I just don't hardly have enough
[17:29] fingers to to stick in the places you
[17:32] could refer to even from just this
[17:35] little portion of scripture
[17:37] but I focus there on the
[17:40] and it's a song of degrees my Bible says
[17:43] and obviously the praise of David's
[17:45] heart and the meditation
[17:48] and there's uh
[17:50] certainly promises and blessings within
[17:52] it
[17:54] but verse 8
[17:56] well for seven and eight
[17:58] it's talking about preservation of the
[18:00] Lord he said the Lord shall preserve
[18:02] thee from all evil he shall preserve thy
[18:05] Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going
[18:07] out and thy coming in from this time
[18:09] forth and even forevermore that's our
[18:12] promise our going in and coming out
[18:15] is preserved by the Lord and I was
[18:17] thinking about preservation just and it
[18:20] wasn't even on my heart to say these
[18:22] things but uh being a hunter and you
[18:25] harvest game and you want to preserve it
[18:27] and and get the benefit of it sometimes
[18:29] you're in the field and you have to put
[18:31] ice on it you know you can preserve a
[18:33] little while with just ice you can
[18:36] preserve like the old-timers used to do
[18:37] with smoke sometimes with heat with salt
[18:40] different means of of preservation
[18:43] but they only last for a season right
[18:45] think of this the preservation of life
[18:48] itself
[18:49] you take an animal's life and and it
[18:52] turns it starts dying we know brother
[18:54] around taught us in 72 hours after a
[18:57] spoken a cancer goes out sometimes it
[18:59] swells up and the person that oh I'm
[19:00] worse off than I was I'm not healed it's
[19:02] just that life dying and it's trying to
[19:05] to mortify well
[19:08] there's a life Giver that can sustain us
[19:11] and preserve Us by quickening life back
[19:14] to us these bodies are failing they're
[19:16] going down getting arthritic stumbling
[19:19] they age
[19:21] they're gonna die
[19:23] but we have a life within us that's
[19:24] going to Quicken us into everlasting
[19:26] life
[19:27] amen
[19:29] and I just think of the way Luke put it
[19:31] and he's talking about the Lord Jesus he
[19:33] says and the time came when he he was to
[19:37] be received up he steadfastly set his
[19:40] face to go to Jerusalem
[19:42] brother sister this is the time
[19:45] we have to steadfastly set our faces to
[19:48] the job and the task is set before us
[19:50] and realize that the Lord is doing the
[19:52] keeping he's preserving us
[19:55] very quickly it would go to John
[19:58] and of course brother Brown probably uh
[20:00] quoted this as much as he did
[20:03] Saint John Ford the woman at the well
[20:08] Saint John 14 12 was one of his
[20:10] favorites he said verily verily I say
[20:12] unto you he that believeth on me the
[20:15] work shall I do
[20:17] The Works that I do shall he do also and
[20:19] the Greater Works than these shall they
[20:22] do because I go unto my father but we're
[20:24] going to drop down
[20:27] in just a little bit
[20:31] and look at verse number 21.
[20:34] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[20:37] them
[20:38] he is that loveth me and he that loveth
[20:41] me shall be loved of my father and I
[20:43] will love him and will manifest myself
[20:45] to him
[20:47] okay the original promise that God gave
[20:49] to Abraham was totally unconditional
[20:52] he said I have already done this I have
[20:54] established thee and thy seed it's going
[20:56] to be forever and I see it shall be like
[20:58] the Sands of the sea
[21:00] okay Abraham didn't have anything to do
[21:02] with that
[21:03] it was already done
[21:06] the children of Israel later they said
[21:08] if you will stay in that land when they
[21:10] got out of that land they didn't get the
[21:11] promise he said go take the land every
[21:13] footstep you take is yours possession
[21:15] they get out of the land they get out of
[21:17] the will of God don't mix yourself with
[21:19] inhabitants and other lands
[21:20] okay we have a promise too if we keep
[21:22] his Commandments
[21:24] amen I wanted I want to say we need
[21:27] strict adherence to the word of the Lord
[21:29] we've got to keep his Commandments and
[21:31] Judas saith unto him not as scary Lord
[21:33] how is it that thou will manifest
[21:36] thyself unto us and not into the world
[21:38] he has a secret group of people a select
[21:41] elect group Jesus answered and said if a
[21:43] man love me
[21:45] he will keep my words and my father will
[21:47] love him
[21:49] and we will come unto him and make our
[21:51] Abode with him he that loveth me not
[21:53] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[21:55] which you hear is not mine but the
[21:57] fathers which sent me
[22:00] you know and I started looking at
[22:01] hearing and keeping and in the Hebrew
[22:04] it's amazing how tied those two are
[22:07] together
[22:08] and uh I just read and you can take your
[22:12] own discernment of what it means and
[22:14] Quicken to you
[22:15] foreign
[22:18] just very quickly it says is Shamar a
[22:22] primary root to hedge about this is keep
[22:24] to hedge about as with thorns guard
[22:28] generally to protect attend to beware be
[22:32] circumspect take heed to self keep
[22:40] look narrowly observe preserve and
[22:43] regard
[22:45] save self sure that lay wait for are a
[22:49] Watchman amen he is all those things
[22:51] when he preserves us and here is here so
[22:54] here he that heareth my words
[22:57] you know I was I was growing up to
[22:58] understand there's a difference in
[23:00] listening and hearing you may hear your
[23:01] parents but listen to them and respond
[23:03] there's a difference he that heareth and
[23:05] understandeth my word he that hath an
[23:07] ear we have a special ear this morning
[23:09] and the word of the Lord is going to
[23:10] come and fall on those ears and it's
[23:12] going to Quicken it to your heart it can
[23:14] hit that ear and not be dropped down
[23:15] into your heart you pay no attention to
[23:17] it
[23:18] that's when he's talking about he that
[23:20] heareth my words the hate man him the
[23:22] father love it amen
[23:27] to hear intelligently often implied of
[23:33] attention obedience
[23:35] caused to tell
[23:38] attentively call gathered together
[23:41] carefully
[23:43] certainly consent consider be content
[23:46] declare
[23:47] diligently discern give ear cause to let
[23:53] make to hear indeed listen make noise he
[23:57] obedient obey perceive
[24:00] make a proclamation think of that
[24:03] regard report show forth and make a
[24:06] sound surely tell understand whosoever
[24:09] heareth Witness
[24:12] it's amazing how when you read a
[24:14] scripture and people get something
[24:15] different from the same scripture you
[24:17] just read
[24:18] that's God's word amen
[24:20] brother John and I were talking about
[24:21] music and I said it's time for him to
[24:23] pick up a new instrument
[24:25] he knows music I don't know music
[24:28] if you don't probably understand my my
[24:30] key is B flat
[24:32] doesn't matter what key it is I'm gonna
[24:33] be flat
[24:36] but for him it's natural and I think God
[24:39] in the beginning music is divine music
[24:43] is an inspiration of God the devil has
[24:45] perverted it just like he's done
[24:46] everything else but music proclaims God
[24:49] and we're going to enjoy that here in
[24:50] just a few minutes with music Amen Let
[24:53] It come down and sweep your soul
[24:55] amen but let's go to Psalm 121 before I
[24:58] get along here
[25:00] amen it's just I want to say it just
[25:02] envelops you you get into the word of
[25:04] God
[25:05] and it ties together all over whatever
[25:07] you have need of he is a provider amen

[25:32] hills from which cometh my help my Help
[25:35] Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven
[25:37] and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to
[25:40] be moved he that keepeth thee will not
[25:42] Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel
[25:45] shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord
[25:48] Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon
[25:51] thy right hand the son shall not smite
[25:54] thee my day nor the Moon by Night the
[25:57] Lord shall preserve thee from all evil
[25:59] he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord
[26:02] shall preserve thy going out and thy

[57:52] morning in Jesus precious name we pray
[57:55] amen amen God bless you this morning
[58:00] trust the Lord will bless you let's turn
[58:02] in our Bibles I believe this Psalm 27 if
[58:07] we want to read these
[58:09] the beautiful scriptures
[58:12] found there in psalm
[58:17] 27. and uh
[58:21] I love the psalm reading amen I I
[58:24] certainly identify with brother Tim when
[58:28] when he said he doesn't know music but
[58:31] I certainly know that's true but brother
[58:34] Tim used to lead songs so I know he I
[58:36] know he knows how to sing so
[58:38] it's a blessing to us psalm 27.
[58:42] I'm excited about the word this morning
[58:48] I just trust that I can bring it in the
[58:51] spirit
[58:52] that our messenger brought it that's all
[58:55] I can hope for the brothers we're going
[58:58] to
[59:00] put up and and go through and read some
[59:04] wonderful statements this morning out of
[59:07] the message the rapture
[59:09] I really encourage you if you can to go
[59:13] listen to it and study it this is the
[59:15] scripture that brother Branham uses to
[59:18] open that and
[59:20] I thought it was beautiful this message
[59:23] was preached just very shortly I think
[59:26] it's in December uh I think I have the
[59:29] date here uh let me see I got it here
[59:33] somewhere
[59:34] what
[59:36] December 4th so uh uh we'll do that
[59:40] there were December for well I think I
[59:43] ran off and left my book in there so
[59:46] Billy would you go get those that my
[59:48] books for me there's two of them there
[59:49] the Rapture it says
[59:52] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[59:57] Whom Shall I Fear
[1:00:00] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:00:04] whom shall I be afraid
[1:00:07] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:00:11] foes
[1:00:12] come upon me to eat me eat up my flesh
[1:00:16] they stumble and fell
[1:00:21] though the hosts should encamp against
[1:00:23] me my heart shall fear not fear
[1:00:28] the war should arise against me in this
[1:00:33] will I be confident
[1:00:35] one thing I have desired of the Lord
[1:00:38] that I will seek after
[1:00:42] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:00:45] Lord all the days of my life
[1:00:48] and behold the beauty of the Lord to
[1:00:52] inquire
[1:00:54] of his Temple
[1:00:56] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:01:00] me in his Pavilion in the secrets of his
[1:01:04] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:01:08] me upon a rock our Lord bless you this
[1:01:13] morning you may be seated I think yeah I
[1:01:16] found him right here what's that one is
[1:01:18] that
[1:01:19] okay okay
[1:01:21] we certainly
[1:01:24] loved the Lord this morning and are
[1:01:27] certainly trusting that uh
[1:01:30] it'll be our portion I want to make sure
[1:01:34] I have the
[1:01:35] uh the word because I I just want to go
[1:01:39] through this uh
[1:01:41] this message was preached just shortly
[1:01:44] before the prophet of God left us
[1:01:48] um I think it's extremely significant
[1:01:52] that that the message that he preached
[1:01:56] before communion was the rapture
[1:02:01] the Rapture is
[1:02:04] the most important thing in our lives
[1:02:08] amen that's if it's if I could say
[1:02:12] anything for us this morning it's all
[1:02:17] about the rapture
[1:02:19] Titus tells us and and because even the
[1:02:23] Lord Jesus tells us to the when the
[1:02:26] Watchmen cometh he says when the master
[1:02:28] cometh he said watch be prepared be
[1:02:32] ready Titus talks about 213 looking for
[1:02:36] that blessed and glorious hope
[1:02:39] of of the uh coming of the Lord of his
[1:02:43] soon appearing the scripture tells us
[1:02:46] look up
[1:02:47] for your Redemption draweth not
[1:02:50] and so I think that uh if there's such a
[1:02:55] great event lying before us it would uh
[1:03:00] behoove us
[1:03:02] as individuals do uh
[1:03:06] seriously uh take it into consideration
[1:03:10] of what a serious matter it is and
[1:03:15] and how that uh it would be important
[1:03:19] that we prepare for it
[1:03:22] many of you who have been through school
[1:03:25] i i i
[1:03:27] as you all know I dropped out of high
[1:03:29] school and
[1:03:30] I I went the a way of a sinner of my day
[1:03:35] but God's gracious Mercy uh saved me but
[1:03:41] for those of you who would prepare for a
[1:03:44] test you you would study you would you'd
[1:03:46] be prepared you'd put effort into it
[1:03:49] because that had some value to you
[1:03:53] and so I'd ask this morning
[1:03:56] what value does the rapture
[1:04:00] have to you
[1:04:02] I think it would be something that we
[1:04:06] certainly wouldn't want to miss
[1:04:10] and so I want to uh
[1:04:14] talk to you this morning about it
[1:04:18] and and how it comes about
[1:04:22] to the believer
[1:04:25] so how is God preparing you for the
[1:04:28] rapture because God provides everything
[1:04:32] that the believer has need of that's one
[1:04:36] thing he's Jehovah Jireh God's a
[1:04:39] provider so God has a provided way so if
[1:04:44] God has a Rapture for you he has a
[1:04:47] provided way for you to see it he has a
[1:04:51] provided way for you to prepare for it
[1:04:54] and he has a way for you to know if
[1:04:57] you're part of it
[1:05:01] and I think that uh the the reason that
[1:05:06] people are going in so many different
[1:05:09] directions
[1:05:11] today is that there's something about it
[1:05:15] that there that's imperative to them
[1:05:19] they know something's happening
[1:05:22] I mean if they're watching the world
[1:05:24] fall apart right in front of their eyes
[1:05:26] and they don't know how to stop it and
[1:05:30] the more they try to heal it
[1:05:33] fix it the worst to give
[1:05:37] they have such a bad drug problem in
[1:05:40] certain areas of the country so many
[1:05:43] people are dying of drug overdoses you
[1:05:47] know they're dying of drug overdoses
[1:05:49] because they haven't received the life
[1:05:51] that God's offered to a
[1:05:55] a person the gift of God's eternal life
[1:05:58] through Christ Jesus right now
[1:06:00] look so they're going to try to fix the
[1:06:03] problem so they put up vending machines
[1:06:06] that have crack pipes so they can smoke
[1:06:09] crack without getting infected that give
[1:06:12] them new needles so they don't have to
[1:06:14] use needles they give them and I
[1:06:16] overdose drugs and and they're just
[1:06:19] going to put them in a dispenser and and
[1:06:21] hand them out to everybody
[1:06:24] well it's just
[1:06:26] it's ignorance
[1:06:28] because they don't know what the
[1:06:31] solution is I know what the solution is
[1:06:34] for every drug addict in this country is
[1:06:37] to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[1:06:40] personal Lord and Savior and be baptized
[1:06:43] with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:47] that's the solution
[1:06:50] it's a solution
[1:06:52] God had a solution
[1:06:55] for a dying generation
[1:06:58] he had a solution for this generation in
[1:07:01] this age and in this time
[1:07:07] it breaks my heart a lot when
[1:07:12] that solution is no longer felt to be
[1:07:17] able to do what it was sent to do
[1:07:23] in other words it's abandoned
[1:07:27] well this doesn't work anymore
[1:07:33] and that's a great deception
[1:07:37] Jesus told them he says I have not come
[1:07:41] to destroy the law
[1:07:43] but I have come to fulfill it
[1:07:46] every jot in every Tittle everything
[1:07:48] that was spoken of me and that the
[1:07:51] prophets wrote of me I'm here to do it I
[1:07:54] am and so they they looked upon it and
[1:07:59] they rejected it
[1:08:02] and their end is destruction
[1:08:09] what I want to just let it really sink
[1:08:12] deep in you is make sure that that that
[1:08:17] you understand
[1:08:21] and that you are not rejecting
[1:08:25] the very thing that God sent
[1:08:28] to prep you
[1:08:31] and direct you to the rapture
[1:08:35] so God has a way
[1:08:37] of of doing it and how many knows his
[1:08:41] ways his word
[1:08:43] is that right we know that we know that
[1:08:46] God does everything by his word in the
[1:08:49] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:08:52] God
[1:08:52] and the Word was God everything that was
[1:08:56] made was made by him it was made by the
[1:08:58] word of God in the beginning was the
[1:09:01] word
[1:09:03] so can every age and if the brothers
[1:09:06] want to follow along this is from the
[1:09:08] message the Rapture page paragraph 47
[1:09:11] God allots his word out of each age
[1:09:17] and each one of those ages has to
[1:09:22] manifest that
[1:09:24] so each one of those ages has to
[1:09:27] manifest the word that's allotted for
[1:09:32] that age
[1:09:33] not another age
[1:09:35] so you understand that you have to
[1:09:41] receive the word that's allotted and God
[1:09:46] has to manifest that word to you so you
[1:09:50] know it is the allotted word now I can
[1:09:54] preach the gospel of another age
[1:09:58] I could preach justification I could
[1:10:00] preach sanctification and it would be
[1:10:02] good I could preach the restoration of
[1:10:05] the gifts and all those things that be
[1:10:08] true because they're part of the word
[1:10:10] but the important thing is to understand
[1:10:13] be a part of the word that's allotted
[1:10:16] not to do away with that because that's
[1:10:20] what leads us but to understand that
[1:10:23] there is an allotted portion of God's
[1:10:25] word to you
[1:10:31] and he has also foreigned men
[1:10:35] for that age to fulfill that word
[1:10:42] this is a deep Foundation of what we're
[1:10:45] laying this morning
[1:10:47] every time he allots his word he
[1:10:51] allotted a man
[1:10:53] for it
[1:10:56] God's always dealt with this church by
[1:10:59] what in Sun Dry times in diverse manners
[1:11:02] God moved upon his servants the prophets
[1:11:08] we know that the word of the Lord comes
[1:11:10] to a prophet
[1:11:12] so in every age that God wanted to turn
[1:11:16] a corner in every age that he allotted a
[1:11:19] word he allotted a man to bring that
[1:11:23] word and manifest the spirit of that age
[1:11:26] which was allotted
[1:11:30] basic Bible
[1:11:34] but what happens if you reject the man
[1:11:38] or what happens if you don't feel you
[1:11:40] need the man anymore
[1:11:42] or what happens if you feel that his
[1:11:44] message has gone by
[1:11:46] what happens if you feel that it wasn't
[1:11:49] complete and it wasn't full enough
[1:11:55] well a very simple
[1:12:01] they
[1:12:02] that's the way he chose to do it
[1:12:06] he said he allotted a man to fulfill it
[1:12:10] when he lauded Moses time he had lauded
[1:12:13] Moses to it
[1:12:15] when he allotted the time for the Son of
[1:12:18] God to be born he allotted him to it
[1:12:21] every age he allots his man
[1:12:25] forordained as the Bible said
[1:12:32] oh
[1:12:35] you can't separate the man from his
[1:12:38] message
[1:12:41] understand it deeply this morning
[1:12:45] if God is infinite Almighty all-powerful
[1:12:50] omnipresent uh
[1:12:53] omnipresent omnificent why he knows all
[1:12:57] things from the beginning so he knowed
[1:13:00] there's nothing out of character it's
[1:13:04] just us thinking it is
[1:13:12] he's going
[1:13:14] hit thinking it is it's everything
[1:13:18] running look back in his word and see
[1:13:22] what he's doing and then you'll have
[1:13:26] understanding
[1:13:28] so we know that God in every age a lot
[1:13:34] his man
[1:13:38] for the job
[1:13:41] so when we understand in our age that
[1:13:45] God sent the seventh Church age
[1:13:47] messenger
[1:13:49] that we were promised Elijah the prophet
[1:13:52] we are promised the Fulfillment of
[1:13:54] Malachi 4 5. so we understand that if
[1:13:59] that within looking at that man we
[1:14:02] understand we can look at it and we can
[1:14:04] say this life
[1:14:07] was that promised word manifested
[1:14:11] so we could see in the man the
[1:14:14] manifestation of the light of the word
[1:14:20] what was Jesus it was every prophesied
[1:14:24] when he prophesied Jesus he was the one
[1:14:26] that fulfilled it Moses fulfilled
[1:14:29] everything that was to prophesy
[1:14:32] so we have a we have a great Anchor
[1:14:35] Place
[1:14:36] that we can stand
[1:14:38] so we know there's a word allotted to
[1:14:42] every age
[1:14:43] you understand that and a man to bring
[1:14:46] that word
[1:14:48] to live that word and manifest that word
[1:14:55] you all have that I trust that you've
[1:14:58] received that revelation
[1:15:01] and then so there there's one thing that
[1:15:04] we certainly understand about the word
[1:15:07] of God and and
[1:15:11] the word of God has got to see self-care
[1:15:15] he said I was speaking the other night
[1:15:18] in Shreveport in communion
[1:15:21] when they killed the sacrificial lamb
[1:15:24] there was to be no leaven among them
[1:15:29] through an entire seven days
[1:15:32] no leaven
[1:15:34] no leavened bread
[1:15:36] everything had to be unleavened
[1:15:41] that represents the seven Church ages
[1:15:44] that we get in the book here and there's
[1:15:48] no leaven what it's something mixed with
[1:15:52] it
[1:15:54] okay there can't be anything mixed with
[1:15:57] it
[1:15:58] and we mix Creeds and denomination and
[1:16:03] everything with the word and still try
[1:16:06] to call it the word no leaven shall be
[1:16:11] in the entire seven days
[1:16:15] it's open no 11. so I have a question
[1:16:18] for you where are you gonna get the pure
[1:16:24] unadulterated
[1:16:26] unleavened word of God
[1:16:32] Where Are You Gonna Get It Where Are You
[1:16:35] Gonna you can't eat it can't be mixed
[1:16:38] where are you gonna get the word that's
[1:16:40] not mixed with I creeds
[1:16:43] denominations in other words systems
[1:16:46] that try to bring men all into the same
[1:16:49] thinking all in the same form all into
[1:16:52] the same action
[1:16:55] spirits that try to clone people's uh uh
[1:16:59] actions and directions and personalities
[1:17:03] good right
[1:17:06] evidences
[1:17:09] where are you going to get somebody
[1:17:10] where are you going to get the pure word
[1:17:15] from the man that God allotted for the
[1:17:19] age
[1:17:22] that's the source
[1:17:27] can't have any leaven in it
[1:17:30] 59.
[1:17:31] even when it is eat today don't try to
[1:17:36] keep it for tomorrow
[1:17:38] burn it with fire before Night comes for
[1:17:41] there's a new message coming forth and a
[1:17:45] new thing
[1:17:47] thank you
[1:17:51] see try to hold it over
[1:17:55] but that's been the attitude of the
[1:17:57] church
[1:18:00] try to hold it over
[1:18:04] he said no he said there's a new thing
[1:18:08] there's something new
[1:18:11] for the people that's allotted for the
[1:18:13] age
[1:18:17] don't hold it over
[1:18:21] you know that goes on in our lives
[1:18:24] God deals with us he shows us a few
[1:18:27] things we set up camp on those few
[1:18:31] things
[1:18:34] and we we depart from the journey
[1:18:39] and we we settle down
[1:18:42] and and
[1:18:43] the worst spirit in the world for that's
[1:18:46] a Catholic Church
[1:18:48] I'm a Catholic
[1:18:51] well I believe for a long time just
[1:18:54] because I was a Catholic and the
[1:18:56] Catholic was the true church
[1:19:00] that being a Catholic is what made me go
[1:19:03] to heaven
[1:19:07] there's millions of people that think
[1:19:10] that way
[1:19:12] they think because what they believe
[1:19:17] is what's going to account
[1:19:19] what you believe doesn't account for
[1:19:22] anything
[1:19:25] okay so I hope that all of your hearts
[1:19:29] this morning
[1:19:31] want to move towards the rapture
[1:19:36] don't get to that con of that subtle
[1:19:40] deception that says oh the Rapture is
[1:19:43] come and whoever it comes for that's who
[1:19:46] it'll get and one day
[1:19:50] the bride hath made herself ready
[1:19:56] you prepare
[1:19:58] you prepare for the day of the Lord
[1:20:02] he says and keep it for tomorrow burn it
[1:20:05] with fire for there's a new message
[1:20:07] coming forth a new thing see trying to
[1:20:10] hold it over but that's been the
[1:20:12] attitude of the church every Bible Goes
[1:20:15] Forth and the first thing you know
[1:20:17] within three years they start organizing
[1:20:21] over it a denomination starts to
[1:20:24] organize
[1:20:26] and so we we understand that that
[1:20:30] there's got to be no leaven
[1:20:36] so what God has to has provided for
[1:20:40] Seven Ages there's coming in age because
[1:20:44] God sent a man
[1:20:46] to manifest the unleavened word that you
[1:20:51] can now eat
[1:20:53] unleavened word word that's not mixed
[1:20:58] with anything
[1:20:59] don't mix it
[1:21:02] stay with it
[1:21:06] so we're we're talking about this
[1:21:09] rapture
[1:21:10] so one of the characteristics
[1:21:13] of those that are preparing for the
[1:21:17] Rapture their lives have no leaven in it
[1:21:25] eleven free life
[1:21:29] now
[1:21:30] you say well is that
[1:21:34] Fair
[1:21:37] look in other words if God gives
[1:21:40] something that manifests
[1:21:43] then he can give the church something
[1:21:46] that removes the leaven
[1:21:52] he's got to give something that is
[1:21:55] unleavened
[1:21:56] something that you can look at and and
[1:22:00] see and say okay what is truth and what
[1:22:06] is leaven
[1:22:10] he's got to raise up a standard he's got
[1:22:14] to raise up something that that speaks
[1:22:18] the truth that reveals the truth and
[1:22:21] shows the truth
[1:22:23] in this age one of the things that the
[1:22:26] word of God Did It revealed the son of
[1:22:30] perdition
[1:22:33] and we know in this last day
[1:22:39] the angel of Light
[1:22:42] would be exposed
[1:22:46] where does God do that with
[1:22:50] his word
[1:22:54] what is his word
[1:22:56] is it the Bible
[1:23:00] or is it at the Bible made flesh
[1:23:08] so if God allotted a word for every day
[1:23:13] and he lauded a man to bring and
[1:23:16] manifest that word for every age
[1:23:20] then the work is in the message that God
[1:23:24] sent not held over things from days gone
[1:23:28] by
[1:23:30] but a pure
[1:23:32] true
[1:23:34] unadulterated word
[1:23:37] that the believer could feed on
[1:23:41] and live by
[1:23:44] and
[1:23:45] prepare by and this word would manifest
[1:23:51] in them
[1:23:54] so it can't have any leaven
[1:23:58] now what is the rapture
[1:24:02] going to be
[1:24:07] is it just a random act
[1:24:11] in time
[1:24:13] in other words you're just walking along
[1:24:16] and living your life and boom
[1:24:19] you rapture
[1:24:25] is it
[1:24:27] something that's unfindable
[1:24:33] or something that you can't understand
[1:24:40] is it just the mystery
[1:24:45] no
[1:24:59] he says make this statement did you know
[1:25:01] the Protestant and Catholic Church
[1:25:04] is predicted in the last days to be
[1:25:07] blind the same thing to the scriptures
[1:25:10] with Christ on the outside trying to get
[1:25:13] in
[1:25:14] because thou saith I am rich and have
[1:25:17] need of nothing and know it's not thou
[1:25:21] are miserable poor wretched naked and
[1:25:24] blind and don't know it Revelations 3
[1:25:27] there you are
[1:25:29] back to the blindness again
[1:25:33] trampling over the things of God as if
[1:25:36] they didn't mean nothing to them
[1:25:39] scoffers making fun of it that's what
[1:25:43] the Bible said
[1:25:47] yes just trembling over the things of
[1:25:50] God
[1:25:52] it's not important
[1:25:56] you know I mean it's not serious
[1:26:01] life isn't a party
[1:26:05] you know what it isn't Church than
[1:26:07] Fellowship Church then Fellowship let's
[1:26:10] call it let's go to the restaurant let's
[1:26:13] have a barbecue let's do this no you
[1:26:16] must eat the word of God with singleness
[1:26:18] of heart
[1:26:20] with fear and trembling
[1:26:23] preparing yourself for that great and
[1:26:26] Dreadful day and I say use that which
[1:26:30] God hath given you to prepare
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:36] but what is the rapture
[1:26:40] but to the church the bride the Rapture
[1:26:44] is a revelation to her
[1:26:50] so what is the rapture
[1:26:54] it's a revelation
[1:26:56] where are you going to get that
[1:26:59] revelation
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:07] it's a revelation
[1:27:11] may I I mean could you imagine I'm sorry
[1:27:15] I'm just not spiritual enough to come up
[1:27:18] with better uh explanations and things
[1:27:21] but could you imagine the Rapture being
[1:27:25] passed out
[1:27:29] like a ticket
[1:27:32] like a token
[1:27:34] like a price paid
[1:27:39] here my brother
[1:27:41] here's the rapture
[1:27:45] who else wants the rapture
[1:27:50] well you're going to get it this morning
[1:27:54] what is it
[1:27:56] that
[1:27:57] receive
[1:27:59] it's a what
[1:28:01] a revelation
[1:28:03] the Rapture to the Bride is a revelation
[1:28:07] let me ask you this morning
[1:28:10] if the Raptors are revelation
[1:28:14] okay
[1:28:15] you've got to ask yourself do I got it
[1:28:20] and if I don't
[1:28:22] where do I get it
[1:28:27] in every age
[1:28:32] God allots the word what is the word
[1:28:36] that's allotted for our age the
[1:28:40] revelation of the rapture
[1:28:46] oh yeah
[1:28:49] it's a revelation
[1:28:52] why why is the Revelation freely given
[1:28:55] because the word was freely given
[1:28:59] let's just walk a little bit this
[1:29:02] morning do you like to walk in God's
[1:29:04] word
[1:29:05] the Rapture is a revelation to her it's
[1:29:08] revealed to her
[1:29:11] that the revelation of the true bride of
[1:29:15] Christ will be waiting for that
[1:29:18] revelation of the Rapture Hallelujah
[1:29:24] that's what she's waiting for
[1:29:29] she's waiting for that revelation of the
[1:29:32] rapture
[1:29:35] she's looking up
[1:29:37] hurry Jim's dying nigh
[1:29:41] now here comes a man
[1:29:49] ordained of God
[1:29:51] with a message
[1:29:53] what's he packing
[1:29:56] he's packing the revelation
[1:30:00] of the rapture
[1:30:05] not an event
[1:30:10] the Rapture is a condition
[1:30:14] is when that bride gets that Rapture in
[1:30:17] faith
[1:30:18] when she's prepared herself she's made
[1:30:20] ready there's an invisible Union and her
[1:30:24] and the bridegroom have become one
[1:30:27] Hallelujah
[1:30:32] Not A tingle
[1:30:35] or a chill
[1:30:37] but something that's so deep down inside
[1:30:48] will be waiting for the revelation of
[1:30:50] the rapture
[1:30:56] now it's a revelation
[1:31:00] for Revelation is faith
[1:31:03] you cannot have a revelation without it
[1:31:07] being faith
[1:31:09] faith is a revelation because it's
[1:31:12] something that God's revealed to you
[1:31:17] faith is a revelation
[1:31:19] faith is something that God that has
[1:31:22] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:31:25] Abraham that could call anything
[1:31:28] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:31:32] him as though it wasn't so
[1:31:40] Molloy
[1:31:41] I love the launch
[1:31:44] right there
[1:31:50] if it hasn't been revealed to you
[1:31:53] I don't care what's said
[1:31:59] you don't go after it
[1:32:02] if there's a question raised pray about
[1:32:05] it
[1:32:08] pray for revelation
[1:32:11] the answer is not explanation
[1:32:15] it is in fancy words and enticing words
[1:32:19] men of great speech
[1:32:23] Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:32:24] enticing words but I came to you with
[1:32:27] power and demonstration of the spirit
[1:32:31] the ability to discern between good and
[1:32:35] evil between right and wrong between
[1:32:37] false and Truth
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:43] solid rocks
[1:32:47] like he said them that I might dwell in
[1:32:50] your house forever that my feet might be
[1:32:53] established upon the rock
[1:32:59] serious
[1:33:02] but joyful
[1:33:09] as though it wasn't so now faith that
[1:33:12] that's what faith is it's the revelation
[1:33:15] of God the church is built upon a
[1:33:20] revelation the whole entire body
[1:33:26] it's got to be revelation
[1:33:30] then you can't be tossed
[1:33:34] to and fro
[1:33:37] by every wind of Doctrine
[1:33:39] every breath of air
[1:33:41] everything that moves
[1:33:44] I've been in this message a long time
[1:33:49] over 50 years
[1:33:53] I've been Revival after Revival
[1:33:57] rise up
[1:34:01] rapturing Doctrine after rapturing
[1:34:04] Doctrine
[1:34:06] rise up
[1:34:09] but I can tell you one thing that I
[1:34:11] found I found it's exactly the way that
[1:34:15] brother Branham said it would be
[1:34:20] where did rapturing Faith Lie
[1:34:25] what was going to be the source
[1:34:28] of this rapturing faith
[1:34:35] because this is what he said in
[1:34:37] paragraph 73 he said he said flesh him
[1:34:41] blood
[1:34:42] never revealed this to you but my Father
[1:34:46] which in heaven has revealed it to you
[1:34:48] Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:34:52] now what is it Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:34:55] my church The revelation of the word
[1:35:00] in its season
[1:35:10] so there's a word
[1:35:15] for the season
[1:35:19] now you can't go back
[1:35:22] and look back 50 years ago
[1:35:26] and say that the word remained there
[1:35:31] then Noah's message would be good
[1:35:35] now we know
[1:35:37] that God chose this man for this age
[1:35:41] how he would deliver his message to the
[1:35:45] church
[1:35:46] and God told them that this message
[1:35:50] would be delivered how are you going to
[1:35:52] deliver to the church he says I am going
[1:35:55] to store it up
[1:36:01] I am going to record it
[1:36:08] and others have taken it and printed it
[1:36:11] out
[1:36:13] it doesn't matter what God Said I am
[1:36:15] going to store my word up
[1:36:18] because there's a reason for that it had
[1:36:22] to be a voice
[1:36:25] for the Lord himself shall descend with
[1:36:27] a shout a voice a message
[1:36:34] so that was going to be stored up
[1:36:38] and now that feels
[1:36:41] food
[1:36:43] by the spirit of God would be brought
[1:36:46] forth in season
[1:36:51] not a different word
[1:36:53] same word
[1:36:56] that was stored
[1:36:58] quickened
[1:37:00] to you
[1:37:02] by revelation
[1:37:09] if you have a storehouse
[1:37:15] and you know there's Revelation on there
[1:37:18] not only revelation
[1:37:20] but rapturing revelation
[1:37:23] how important would that voice come to
[1:37:26] you
[1:37:32] how important
[1:37:34] would it be for you to hear it
[1:37:38] the Rapture is not a second hand
[1:37:42] experience
[1:37:47] is food
[1:37:50] the church is built on the revelation
[1:37:55] of the word in its season
[1:37:58] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:38:01] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[1:38:04] The Book of Revelation is the last book
[1:38:07] of the Bible it's sealed to unbelievers
[1:38:11] in there the Bible says in the 22nd
[1:38:15] chapter whosoever take one word from it
[1:38:18] or add one word to it I'll take his part
[1:38:24] from The Book of Life
[1:38:27] I'll tell you it would behoove you
[1:38:30] to know if somebody's adding or taking
[1:38:33] away
[1:38:39] don't go by a feel good
[1:38:42] or don't go by a demonstration we'll get
[1:38:45] into that this in a little bit
[1:38:49] but how are you gonna know whether
[1:38:53] something is counterfeit or not
[1:38:57] by taking it to the original
[1:39:04] and we have the original
[1:39:07] word of God message of the hour because
[1:39:11] God's word comes from to a prophet and a
[1:39:15] prophet is a Divine interpreter of God's
[1:39:18] word
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:23] how simple has he made it
[1:39:26] well prove to me you're a prophet
[1:39:34] you have this wrong I see you right here
[1:39:37] you're with the doctor you're with that
[1:39:41] blind eyes
[1:39:43] death dead raised
[1:39:45] every Vindicated sign
[1:39:49] that proved that Jesus was the Messiah
[1:39:53] every single one of those same signs
[1:39:56] proved and Vindicated that this message
[1:40:00] was from God
[1:40:08] sure it was scoffed
[1:40:10] not and impersonate it
[1:40:14] but not to those that get through
[1:40:15] revelation
[1:40:19] it's not by flesh and blood
[1:40:22] though so many of us are now are trying
[1:40:25] to Anchor it on a fleshly experience
[1:40:32] brothers and sisters
[1:40:34] pitch to your heart
[1:40:38] he says the revelation
[1:40:42] he said it says that the table of a book
[1:40:46] we realize that then it was altogether
[1:40:50] given for
[1:40:52] believers
[1:40:56] and it opens the Book of Revelation and
[1:41:00] reveals who is the author of the entire
[1:41:03] book is
[1:41:05] he is to look upon as Alpha and Omega
[1:41:10] from Genesis to Revelation Jesus Christ
[1:41:14] just the same right straight through he
[1:41:19] reveals a complete mystery of himself
[1:41:24] and his plan for his church ages to come
[1:41:30] and it was sealed with
[1:41:33] seven
[1:41:35] seals
[1:41:37] where are we going to get this
[1:41:40] Revelation from and the whole plan
[1:41:44] now not in other ages
[1:41:47] they all be part of the Rapture though
[1:41:50] they haven't come to that but we're not
[1:41:53] in that age we're in the lady of CNAs
[1:41:56] we're in the seventh age we're in the
[1:42:00] opening of The Seven Seals so where are
[1:42:03] you going to get your rapture
[1:42:07] where are you going to get your
[1:42:09] revelation
[1:42:13] because it was sealed up
[1:42:18] but this messenger
[1:42:22] he's going to open those Seven Seals
[1:42:28] and he's going to reveal the church
[1:42:32] the mystery
[1:42:34] of the word of God that's going to allow
[1:42:38] them to receive the revelation of the
[1:42:42] rapture
[1:42:45] what those seven Thunders help
[1:42:54] now the book was written but then
[1:42:56] remember it was sealed with Seven Seals
[1:42:59] and these Seven Seals was not to be
[1:43:02] opened Revelation 10 tell the sounding
[1:43:06] of the last Earthly angel on Earth
[1:43:10] Revelations 10 7 and in the days of the
[1:43:14] sounding of the last Angel's message the
[1:43:18] seventh angel the mysteries of God
[1:43:20] should be finished in that age and that
[1:43:25] that's the age we're living in
[1:43:32] now there's people that go around
[1:43:33] preaching that this Seven Seals were
[1:43:36] opened in the first church age
[1:43:42] they weren't opened
[1:43:44] nobody saw it in the first church
[1:43:47] now you look back and historically see
[1:43:50] it
[1:43:52] you can see that the white horse rider
[1:43:55] went out nobody saw the Weiss writer
[1:43:58] going out nobody saw the deception of
[1:44:01] Satan nobody saw that Satan appeared as
[1:44:05] an angel of Light
[1:44:08] nobody saw he had access to the name of
[1:44:11] Jesus Christ and what he was doing
[1:44:13] sowing false Doctrine sowing leaven
[1:44:16] sowing ideas nobody saw it
[1:44:23] it was opened in this age
[1:44:26] why was it open to you
[1:44:30] because you're the people that need the
[1:44:34] revelations of the rapture
[1:44:39] I'll move right along
[1:44:42] and these days the sounding of the last
[1:44:45] seventh angel message
[1:44:46] that's it
[1:44:48] we all know that we're living in the
[1:44:50] lady of CN age
[1:44:54] there will never be another age to it
[1:44:57] it can't be so we're living in the lady
[1:45:00] you'll see in age and the Seven Seals
[1:45:03] that held the book is from mysterious
[1:45:07] two people should be open
[1:45:11] at that day that's what he promised now
[1:45:15] it won't be nothing outside of the word
[1:45:18] because you can't add to it or take away
[1:45:22] from the word it's God to remain always
[1:45:26] the word but the Revelation is to reveal
[1:45:31] the truth of it what it is to make it
[1:45:36] fit with the rest of the scriptures and
[1:45:39] then God vindicates that it to be the
[1:45:43] truth
[1:45:44] Hallelujah
[1:45:47] isn't that right
[1:45:49] so we know that the Rapture is a
[1:45:53] revelation
[1:45:55] we know that that who had that
[1:45:58] revelation
[1:46:00] had no leaven in it
[1:46:04] it was pure unadulterated word
[1:46:07] and we understood that the mystery of it
[1:46:10] was hid until the Seven Seals were open
[1:46:16] and then we could understand
[1:46:20] where the revelation of the rapture
[1:46:24] is
[1:46:26] it's in the message
[1:46:33] Revelation comes by what
[1:46:36] hearing
[1:46:38] faith and Revelation the faith comes by
[1:46:41] hearing and hearing the word of God I
[1:46:46] can't believe
[1:46:48] no I won't go there you know that's my
[1:46:50] hobby horse
[1:46:53] you know how I feel about
[1:46:55] things
[1:46:59] but each of you
[1:47:02] if I ask how many of you would have a
[1:47:04] phone it's on there
[1:47:07] you can listen to it you can read it the
[1:47:11] question is are you
[1:47:17] are you diligently seeking
[1:47:22] the revelation of the rapture
[1:47:26] now if you don't believe it's good
[1:47:29] exists
[1:47:34] I wouldn't waste my time
[1:47:40] if if if if you don't come to the house
[1:47:43] of the Lord
[1:47:44] do you hear the word of God so you can
[1:47:47] make preparation
[1:47:49] to be ready then what are you coming for
[1:47:55] go see a psychiatrist
[1:47:59] he can give you little pills that make
[1:48:01] you feel good
[1:48:05] no
[1:48:07] I want to make the rapture
[1:48:10] I want to be ready
[1:48:13] I want to know I want that revelation
[1:48:16] well who
[1:48:20] is
[1:48:21] the Rapture for
[1:48:26] right who's going in the rapture
[1:48:30] it wouldn't that be a great question
[1:48:34] to answer
[1:48:35] that that we want to know who it is okay
[1:48:39] so it's it's got to be there there's God
[1:48:43] God to be something the question so
[1:48:46] let's just read this it says and then
[1:48:49] when the bride is being called out how
[1:48:52] are you going to put it out
[1:48:54] it's the revelation of the manifestation
[1:48:59] of the word made true
[1:49:06] first of all it's the revelation
[1:49:10] of the manifestation of the word made
[1:49:14] true
[1:49:18] behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:49:20] before the great and Dreadful day the
[1:49:23] revelation of the manifestation of that
[1:49:28] word being made true
[1:49:30] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:49:34] angel
[1:49:35] the revelation of the word of God made
[1:49:39] true
[1:49:45] do you need to get that brother I want
[1:49:48] you to take it outside okay instead of
[1:49:57] don't worry we've got people shopping on
[1:50:00] Amazon so
[1:50:05] it's a revelation of the word made True
[1:50:08] what do you think the cloud was
[1:50:14] it was a revelation of the word made
[1:50:17] true
[1:50:19] what do you think the promise of the son
[1:50:22] of man was
[1:50:24] that deity would stand in flesh
[1:50:28] and do the same works that he did before
[1:50:33] it was the revelation of the word of God
[1:50:37] made true
[1:50:40] do you understand what God's done for
[1:50:43] you he's he's revealed to you that the
[1:50:47] word of God for this hour has been
[1:50:50] manifested and made true
[1:50:56] oh praise God
[1:51:06] made true and we're living in that day
[1:51:10] praise God the revelation of the mystery
[1:51:14] of
[1:51:16] his self
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:22] now the Rapture this Rapture that we're
[1:51:27] talking about is only for the bride
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:38] remember the Bible said and the rest of
[1:51:41] the Dead live not for a thousand years
[1:51:44] this great rapture

[1:51:50] friends where are we at
[1:51:55] my goodness

[1:52:02] escape for us out of this place

[1:52:10] think I want this kid to be a a girl
[1:52:12] well he's not a girl he's a boy well we
[1:52:15] don't care we think in his mind
[1:52:23] they're discussing laws
[1:52:28] about being able to take a child that's
[1:52:31] already been born
[1:52:34] 21 days after its birth
[1:52:39] if it looks like it's not going to have
[1:52:41] a a normal life
[1:52:44] God
[1:52:47] don't care about this life
[1:52:49] what happens if he put that little name
[1:52:51] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:52:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:52:57] they've got more life than the people
[1:52:59] that are living they're dead and they
[1:53:02] don't know it
[1:53:06] setting themselves on the throne as if
[1:53:09] they are gods
[1:53:12] listen close
[1:53:21] the Rapture that we're talking about is
[1:53:24] only for revived remember
[1:53:29] this great rapture
[1:53:31] there's not a Rapture friends where
[1:53:33] we're at
[1:53:34] what are we going to do
[1:53:36] what age are we living in
[1:53:39] what promise do we have
[1:53:44] there is going to be a Rapture the Bible
[1:53:47] said there will be and it'll be only for
[1:53:51] the elect the elect lady the Bride of
[1:53:56] this day that's pulled out the church
[1:54:02] the very Word Church means called out of
[1:54:05] as Moses called the nation out of a
[1:54:08] Nation the holy spirit is calling a
[1:54:11] bride out of the church a church out of
[1:54:14] a church
[1:54:16] members from every denomination making
[1:54:19] up the bride the bride tree
[1:54:22] and
[1:54:23] it is in the tape
[1:54:31] it is in the tape
[1:54:33] the bride tree
[1:54:36] the bride coming out
[1:54:38] calling and that's the one that
[1:54:43] and that's the one the bright treat is
[1:54:46] the bride rather is the one that's going
[1:54:49] to be in the rapture
[1:54:51] that alone nothing but the bride the
[1:54:55] elected ones foreknown by God from the
[1:54:59] beginning the father's spiritual Gene
[1:55:05] oh my
[1:55:09] God there's got to be something that
[1:55:11] comes
[1:55:13] that gives the revelation
[1:55:16] to that spiritual Gene
[1:55:20] the elected people that were elected to
[1:55:24] receive it
[1:55:25] he says he says and now
[1:55:29] so were you in
[1:55:31] you've got
[1:55:33] you've got eternal life
[1:55:39] in God before there ever was a world you
[1:55:43] were a part of the Son of God an
[1:55:45] attribute of God he know the very Apes
[1:55:48] that you're coming
[1:55:51] oh my he knew you'd be here Church
[1:55:56] he
[1:55:57] he
[1:56:00] predestinated you to that age
[1:56:04] to take that place
[1:56:06] and no one else can take it
[1:56:11] care how many impersonations and things
[1:56:14] you've got to be there because he knowed
[1:56:17] you would be there and you are made
[1:56:21] manifested now you can fellowship with
[1:56:25] him and that's what he wants he's
[1:56:28] longing for fellowship and worship
[1:56:33] amen is that right
[1:56:36] folk it is for that elected
[1:56:42] predestinated person
[1:56:46] now I'd I'd like to I'd make that sure
[1:56:48] right
[1:56:51] how is it how does it how do you know
[1:56:52] you're an elected
[1:56:54] person
[1:56:57] by revelation
[1:57:02] by revelation
[1:57:04] not by your works
[1:57:08] not by how you like God reveals to you
[1:57:12] that you're his
[1:57:14] I'm going to finish up now
[1:57:17] we got a few sleepings so we we take
[1:57:21] that as a sign
[1:57:30] so we know all those seeds are
[1:57:32] predestinated
[1:57:34] and the body of Jesus Christ the bride
[1:57:36] will be a part of his body
[1:57:39] he was the word and the bride will have
[1:57:42] to be the word
[1:57:45] word added to word added to word
[1:57:50] Luther justification
[1:57:53] Wesley sanctification
[1:57:56] Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:57:59] restoration of gifts and the rest of it
[1:58:02] that goes with it see
[1:58:04] it's got to be word on top of word
[1:58:08] germ on top of germs life on top of life
[1:58:12] to bring out the full statue of the
[1:58:17] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:58:20] remember you was an attribute
[1:58:24] and now the thing of it is after we find
[1:58:28] out these things that Christ is coming
[1:58:30] for us Pride
[1:58:32] now how do we get in to that bride
[1:58:36] that's the question
[1:58:38] so what's been our question right our
[1:58:41] questions then where do you get the pure
[1:58:44] unadulterated word where do you get the
[1:58:47] Revelation from who is the bride
[1:58:52] so now our question is how do you get
[1:58:55] into the bride
[1:58:56] foreign
[1:58:57] say join our congregation
[1:59:03] don't that spirit's out there right now
[1:59:06] Church
[1:59:10] one of them wants a certain type of
[1:59:13] baptism
[1:59:15] one wants to do this and that
[1:59:18] you must beat in tongues or you haven't
[1:59:21] got it the other one says you don't have
[1:59:24] to speak in tongues one says You must
[1:59:28] dance in the spirit this one says You
[1:59:31] must Shout
[1:59:33] that he got a sensation
[1:59:40] it's all all right
[1:59:42] and then still it's all wrong
[1:59:51] there's got to be something
[1:59:56] that clarifies it
[2:00:02] it's all all right
[2:00:05] but yet at the same time it can be all
[2:00:07] wrong
[2:00:08] right right
[2:00:10] no I'm just I'm just reading out of a
[2:00:14] book
[2:00:21] but I just happen to know that book's
[2:00:23] truth
[2:00:24] I just happen to know that book's life
[2:00:27] I've had a divine revelation that this
[2:00:30] is the voice of God
[2:00:36] the Holy Spirit didn't even come to
[2:00:38] speak of itself
[2:00:40] but to bring us into remembrance of all
[2:00:43] things that he said it's always the word
[2:00:47] he said
[2:00:49] he says yet it's all wrong
[2:00:52] now how do we get into this body First
[2:00:55] Corinthians said by one Spirit we're all
[2:00:58] baptized into this body by one's Holy
[2:01:01] Spirit baptism
[2:01:04] that if you want to put that down it's
[2:01:06] First Corinthians 12 13 and by one
[2:01:09] Spirit we are all baptized and the
[2:01:12] spirit is the Life of Christ
[2:01:17] is that right
[2:01:20] The Life of Christ
[2:01:22] and the life of any seed which he was
[2:01:27] the word seed brings the seed to life
[2:01:32] it's the word life that brings the seed
[2:01:36] to life
[2:01:38] what is the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:01:40] it's the word bringing the seed life in
[2:01:45] you to life it is the Life of Christ
[2:01:52] Glory
[2:01:56] you get it
[2:01:58] if that life is laying in the seed and
[2:02:02] the baptism of the spirit comes upon it
[2:02:05] it's bound to bring that seed to life
[2:02:11] this is where the great confusion is
[2:02:13] church
[2:02:15] because a person can intellectually
[2:02:18] recognize
[2:02:22] that Jesus Christ died for their sins
[2:02:27] they can even be convicted
[2:02:32] by the sins that they committed
[2:02:38] and feel the guilt
[2:02:40] and the shame
[2:02:43] and they can acknowledge
[2:02:46] that Jesus Christ paid the price
[2:02:51] for that sin
[2:02:54] now somebody comes along and says that's
[2:02:58] enough
[2:03:00] that's all you have to do
[2:03:04] confess your sins confess that he's Lord
[2:03:06] and that you're a sinner and you shall
[2:03:09] be saved
[2:03:13] or they hear truth
[2:03:16] and there's something that rings in
[2:03:18] their heart and they say that's truth
[2:03:22] so with all their knowledge
[2:03:25] and all their ability
[2:03:28] they dedicate their life to Christ
[2:03:31] and they do everything they can do to
[2:03:34] follow
[2:03:40] that's wonderful
[2:03:42] but it's not the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:45] Spirit
[2:03:49] the baptism of the holy spirit is the
[2:03:54] change of your nature
[2:04:01] where he
[2:04:04] personal pronoun I will not leave you
[2:04:08] comfortless but I will come again I'll
[2:04:12] be with you even in you
[2:04:15] and I'll lead you and guide you into all
[2:04:19] truth and righteousness
[2:04:24] you know
[2:04:27] beyond the shadow of a doubt
[2:04:31] that there's been a change in your heart
[2:04:34] a change in your nature
[2:04:37] now the flesh Wars against the spirit
[2:04:40] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[2:04:42] these things are contrary one to another
[2:04:44] but there's something in you that
[2:04:46] quickly cries out of the father
[2:04:52] because there's no longer a desire for
[2:04:56] sin
[2:04:59] is true yeah there's no more a
[2:05:03] consciousness
[2:05:04] of unbelief
[2:05:10] the baptism of the Holy Spirit ends the
[2:05:14] question of whether you believe or not
[2:05:21] I believe
[2:05:23] in the baptism of the Holy Spirit I
[2:05:27] believe in the life
[2:05:30] of Jesus Christ
[2:05:33] being manifested in the flesh
[2:05:36] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:42] without evidence
[2:05:44] the spirit Bears record of itself
[2:05:50] took if you have the spirit the spirit
[2:05:53] Bears record to the word
[2:05:58] it Bears record to the man that God sent
[2:06:01] right
[2:06:03] it Bears record to the unleavened bread
[2:06:06] it be Bears record that the Rapture is a
[2:06:10] revelation it Bears record that if only
[2:06:13] the Divine elected that's going to be in
[2:06:17] the Rapture it does not
[2:06:20] their record to sensation
[2:06:27] don't do it
[2:06:28] they're born to Kin what are they born
[2:06:31] of they're born of the word of God what
[2:06:34] caused the birth
[2:06:37] it's the word that caused the birth
[2:06:40] the message of the hour causes the birth
[2:06:43] of the Bride in this age
[2:06:49] and that's what happens that's what the
[2:06:52] baptism the holy spirit is is when the
[2:06:54] spirit of the word comes in you there's
[2:06:57] record with the word of God and now
[2:07:00] produces the Life of Christ in you
[2:07:07] and now you can say The Works that he
[2:07:10] did
[2:07:11] I do also why because the same mind is
[2:07:15] in you that was in Christ
[2:07:18] the same compassion is in you that was
[2:07:21] in him the same attributes are
[2:07:25] yes you got a longing for lost souls
[2:07:32] what would be to our record
[2:07:35] if we had the most glorious Hallelujah
[2:07:39] Jericho March
[2:07:42] and we left the sinner
[2:07:45] in his seat
[2:07:48] and not one of us had discernment
[2:07:51] to know if God was moving upon a soul or
[2:07:53] not
[2:07:55] or with one was depressed
[2:07:58] or if one needed a coat
[2:08:02] or if one needed to go another extra
[2:08:04] mile
[2:08:07] all the real evidences
[2:08:09] of the Life of Christ
[2:08:12] are throwing out the window for a
[2:08:14] religious experience
[2:08:16] what good would that do us
[2:08:19] what what good would it be we've got to
[2:08:22] have this baptism up Upon Our Life we've
[2:08:26] got to have that seed come forth because
[2:08:28] Jesus wants fruit of
[2:08:31] for himself his wife must bring forth
[2:08:35] the kind of children that he is
[2:08:43] no
[2:08:47] this is what I want to make sure you
[2:08:49] understand this morning forgive me for
[2:08:51] waiting so long to get here
[2:08:54] we know these things don't we
[2:08:57] but don't we also know that Satan is
[2:09:00] like a roaring lion
[2:09:02] in the last days
[2:09:05] there will rise a deception
[2:09:12] that true
[2:09:15] if I could just maybe read it
[2:09:20] because we understand the great church
[2:09:22] ages and we understand the word you all
[2:09:24] are understand that
[2:09:28] and we know that how does the church get
[2:09:30] into this it's the spirit quickens it it
[2:09:34] must be quickened or brought to life
[2:09:40] this bright character
[2:09:42] must be brought to life Christ in you
[2:09:46] must be brought to life what brings it
[2:09:50] to life
[2:09:52] the word
[2:09:56] the word the spirit quickens or makes
[2:10:00] That Word Alive that's what the Holy
[2:10:03] Spirit does it makes that word live in
[2:10:06] you
[2:10:07] church it's ever a time we need to take
[2:10:11] ourselves personally stand in front of
[2:10:14] the word of God and the mirror of the
[2:10:17] year of thunder and said is my life
[2:10:19] lining up to the message of the hour
[2:10:27] that's your urine fandom
[2:10:30] not Asia's gone by
[2:10:33] yes the living word for now
[2:10:37] he says
[2:10:42] he says I'll just read this and close
[2:10:45] him
[2:10:46] like the sun
[2:10:48] the sun rises in the morning it's a
[2:10:51] little baby born
[2:10:52] it's weak it ain't got much heat to it
[2:10:56] ten o'clock it comes out
[2:10:59] of high school
[2:11:01] in the middle it's entering into life
[2:11:05] three o'clock in the afternoon it's
[2:11:08] getting old
[2:11:09] five o'clock it's dying
[2:11:12] old and weak again going back into the
[2:11:16] grave and at the end of it it'll rise
[2:11:19] again the next morning
[2:11:21] look at the trees they put forth their
[2:11:24] leaves
[2:11:25] everything that they do and we find out
[2:11:28] the leaves drop off and go back what the
[2:11:32] life goes down to the root of the tree
[2:11:33] and at the end it comes back up next
[2:11:37] spring with new life now watch the
[2:11:40] church
[2:11:43] how it's done the same thing
[2:11:46] in Reformation it come out
[2:11:49] the corn of wheat fell into the ground
[2:11:53] and died under the Dark Ages persecution
[2:11:58] it went into the ground it had to die
[2:12:00] any man's spiritual can see that unless
[2:12:04] the seed dies and rots it abides alone
[2:12:07] it has to go into the ground under the
[2:12:10] Dark Ages and lay there rotted and it
[2:12:14] comes forth
[2:12:15] in two little blades of the Lutheran
[2:12:19] Church
[2:12:21] out of the Lutheran Church brought off
[2:12:23] the blades Zeke field and so forth and
[2:12:27] from that come out the tassel which was
[2:12:29] John Wesley the great missionary age
[2:12:33] it drops back out of there and comes
[2:12:36] that deceiving age
[2:12:39] that Pentecostal age
[2:12:42] the corn of wheat
[2:12:45] why is the Pentecostal age the deceiving
[2:12:49] age
[2:12:53] because this is the age
[2:12:56] that there's an anointing without the
[2:13:00] word
[2:13:05] this is the age at the rain falls on the
[2:13:09] just and the unjust
[2:13:17] everyone here that's Ever Raised wheat
[2:13:19] you can look at the wheat when you look
[2:13:24] at it and when you go out and say I've
[2:13:27] got wheat and and it looks like you got
[2:13:31] wheat there but open it up real close
[2:13:34] and watch you haven't got no wheat at
[2:13:37] all
[2:13:38] you've got a shock didn't Jesus warn us
[2:13:42] that Matthew 24 22 in the last days that
[2:13:47] the two Spirits would be so close
[2:13:50] together it would deceive the very elect
[2:13:53] wheat itself if it was possible now
[2:13:57] watch it's a carrier
[2:14:02] what what the a great deception
[2:14:06] now that's the age that we're living in
[2:14:09] now the seventh Church age now it's the
[2:14:13] manifestation of the grain of wheat at
[2:14:16] the end another comeback
[2:14:19] now if you take Luke 17 chapter in the
[2:14:23] 30th verse he says as it was in the days
[2:14:26] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[2:14:29] the son of man when the son of man
[2:14:31] begins to reveal himself
[2:14:34] what is revealed make revelation of what
[2:14:39] he is in this day
[2:14:46] what was the opening of the seals what
[2:14:49] was the revelation
[2:14:54] of the son of man
[2:14:56] it was the revelation of him making
[2:14:59] himself known for what he is in this day
[2:15:07] now there's a great deception
[2:15:11] along with that
[2:15:13] because Satan comes and appears as an
[2:15:17] angel of Light
[2:15:20] and we know that the rain falls on the
[2:15:23] just in the unjust
[2:15:26] and took the very deception of this age
[2:15:31] is the anointing
[2:15:37] that's where the deception lies
[2:15:44] it allies in the anointing because it's
[2:15:47] the same anointing
[2:15:55] so if you put your evidence
[2:15:59] in the anointing
[2:16:02] and you say you're anointed
[2:16:05] I feel the anointing I manifest the
[2:16:09] anointing I'm anointed
[2:16:12] there's how are you going to measure
[2:16:14] that that that's not a deception
[2:16:22] think of it
[2:16:26] there's got to be something that ties
[2:16:29] back
[2:16:30] something that connects genuine to
[2:16:34] something that finally brings it
[2:16:38] took to the things that we know so how
[2:16:43] do we know because now
[2:16:45] so we're in this great deceptive age
[2:16:50] Pentecost
[2:16:52] because it's the pale horse rider
[2:16:55] the anointing's falling on everybody
[2:17:00] there's prayer lines going and and all
[2:17:05] movement of the spirit everywhere
[2:17:08] is it the spirit
[2:17:10] sure it's his beard
[2:17:14] yes sir
[2:17:19] but the question is
[2:17:24] what's it on
[2:17:27] yeah so you can't measure it
[2:17:33] you can measure it by the anointing
[2:17:36] you can't say I feel anointing or I want
[2:17:40] anointing
[2:17:44] so you've got to you've got to
[2:17:46] understand that so how how is he going
[2:17:49] to bring this Rapture right
[2:17:53] to pass
[2:17:56] for the Lord himself shall descend
[2:17:59] right
[2:18:02] with a shout
[2:18:05] correct with a voice
[2:18:09] and with a trump
[2:18:12] so we understand that the colloid
[2:18:15] himself because the first part of it is
[2:18:17] is a shout
[2:18:18] is a message
[2:18:20] to gather his pride together so that he
[2:18:24] can feed her the unleavened word of God
[2:18:27] open the Seven Seals to her
[2:18:32] that she can have the word of God to
[2:18:36] compare the the deception to
[2:18:43] she's cutting out he puts within her
[2:18:46] hand the ability to discern between Good
[2:18:51] and Evil
[2:18:54] what's real
[2:18:55] now
[2:18:57] he provides something to do that right
[2:19:01] now if the deception is so close
[2:19:07] I'm not the judge of that
[2:19:12] I've only thing that I can go back is
[2:19:15] find how can I discern it
[2:19:18] and that is that is just end with this
[2:19:22] there are three things that happens a
[2:19:25] voice a shout a voice of trump
[2:19:28] has happened before Jesus appears now a
[2:19:32] shout Jesus as all three of them
[2:19:37] when he's descending
[2:19:40] a shout what if the shout it's a message
[2:19:44] going forth first
[2:19:47] the living bread of life
[2:19:50] bringing forth
[2:19:52] the bride
[2:19:57] the first thing he does to get you for
[2:20:00] the Rapture is he brings the living
[2:20:02] bread of life
[2:20:07] right the living bread of life to bring
[2:20:11] forth a bride where is the bride going
[2:20:15] to come from forth it's going to come
[2:20:18] forth from the word
[2:20:22] that the messenger brought not from the
[2:20:25] anointing
[2:20:29] the anointing's the deception
[2:20:36] so there's got to be something else the
[2:20:39] believer has to Anchor in else you won't
[2:20:43] know whether the anointing you have or
[2:20:46] not is true
[2:20:52] another if it doesn't anchor in the word
[2:20:57] it won't last
[2:21:01] you've got to be able to ask that
[2:21:04] question in yourself am I anchored to
[2:21:07] the word
[2:21:10] is my source of life
[2:21:13] coming from the shout
[2:21:17] because that's what the shout was for
[2:21:23] right it was a revealed word the open
[2:21:26] word to bring forth the bride by
[2:21:30] Revelation because she's the only one
[2:21:34] going in the Rapture Hallelujah aren't
[2:21:37] you glad for the message of the hour
[2:21:48] the first thing comes when he starts
[2:21:51] descending from Heaven there's a shout
[2:21:54] what is it it's a message to get the
[2:21:58] people together a message comes forth
[2:22:01] first now lamps trimming time rise and
[2:22:05] trim your lamps
[2:22:10] what watch what
[2:22:12] what what watch was that the seventh not
[2:22:16] the sixth the seventh behold the
[2:22:18] bridegroom cometh
[2:22:20] rise and trim your lamps and they did
[2:22:24] and some of them found they didn't have
[2:22:27] any oil in their lamp
[2:22:30] but it's lamp trimming time
[2:22:35] I have to go into the whole teaching of
[2:22:38] the seven candlesticks
[2:22:40] to tell you that the oil
[2:22:43] has been stored up
[2:22:47] the oil
[2:22:49] is in the tapes
[2:22:55] the bride's anointing is on the tapes
[2:23:08] the anointing is the same yes
[2:23:10] fallen on the just an unjust how do I
[2:23:13] know what the anointing I have is
[2:23:15] because that anointing on the bride
[2:23:19] lines up
[2:23:21] with the tapes
[2:23:23] no leaven
[2:23:27] every word every God every tittle
[2:23:32] it's their source of life
[2:23:35] no man in between
[2:23:38] no explanation no great teachers
[2:23:46] it's been revealed to you
[2:23:49] I am the voice of God to you he says
[2:23:54] it's lamp trimming time
[2:23:58] he said paragraph 146.
[2:24:02] didn't Jesus says the rain would fall on
[2:24:05] the just and unjust
[2:24:08] put a cockle bar out there
[2:24:10] and a wheat out there pour water on them
[2:24:14] and keep them under
[2:24:16] keep them under fertilized and things
[2:24:19] like that
[2:24:20] won't they both live by the same water
[2:24:25] amen sure
[2:24:28] well what is it one of them will bear a
[2:24:31] cockover because that's what he is a
[2:24:35] cocklebur will raise his hands and Shout
[2:24:37] just the same as the wheat
[2:24:40] now the Bible said in the last days
[2:24:42] there shall come false christs
[2:24:45] not false jesuses
[2:24:47] false Christ anointed ones falsely
[2:24:52] anointed to the word
[2:24:54] denominationally anointed but not to the
[2:24:58] word what is the deception
[2:25:02] false anointed ones
[2:25:08] that's the deception
[2:25:11] is the anointing
[2:25:15] for the word will bear record of itself
[2:25:19] it don't need nothing else it'll bear
[2:25:22] record of itself
[2:25:24] now there will come false anointed ones
[2:25:27] you get my tape on that
[2:25:30] get my tape on the seals get my tape on
[2:25:33] the bride tree get my tape on the
[2:25:36] anointed ones
[2:25:38] what a message he's telling back to the
[2:25:42] church you've got tapes on that you've
[2:25:45] got tapes on that you've got tapes on
[2:25:48] that
[2:25:52] Church
[2:25:55] if there's this spirits
[2:25:59] would be so close it would deceive the
[2:26:03] very elected possible
[2:26:06] but what does the elect have they have
[2:26:09] this affinity
[2:26:11] with the spoken word for their age
[2:26:15] they have this love affair
[2:26:18] with the spoken word for their age
[2:26:21] they've got an inclination because
[2:26:23] they've got something inside of them
[2:26:25] that says my sheep know my voice another
[2:26:28] they won't follow they quickly run back
[2:26:32] to the source of their life which is the
[2:26:35] word of God it burns in their heart
[2:26:42] the message of life to them
[2:26:47] it's their security
[2:26:51] it's what they hear
[2:26:53] that's put their bread and born on
[2:26:55] that's what they're corrected by that's
[2:26:58] what they're strengthened by
[2:27:02] he said
[2:27:09] he says you call them and say
[2:27:12] or are you Jesus
[2:27:15] oh certainly not they wouldn't stand for
[2:27:18] that but when it comes and says Oh Glory
[2:27:21] I got the anointing
[2:27:24] and it's a genuine anointing remember
[2:27:28] campus had it too and prophesied so did
[2:27:33] Balaam have it and prophesy
[2:27:38] they won't stand to say in their Jesus
[2:27:42] but they'll claim to have the anointing
[2:27:45] but that don't have nothing to do with
[2:27:48] this inside
[2:27:52] unless that was God's seed
[2:27:56] his genuine from the beginning
[2:27:59] predestinated you're finished
[2:28:02] I don't care how much you shout speak
[2:28:05] with tongues run and Shout It has
[2:28:09] nothing to do with it
[2:28:15] it's fine
[2:28:17] but remember it don't have nothing to do
[2:28:20] with this on the inside it don't have
[2:28:25] nothing to do with the rapture
[2:28:33] why does he preach this
[2:28:36] right before he leaves the scene
[2:28:39] you don't think he knew what was coming
[2:28:42] you don't think he knew what was there
[2:28:44] what was going to come
[2:28:47] that the anointed would be the deception
[2:28:52] that they would be turned to shouting
[2:28:55] and and speaking in tongues and running
[2:29:03] you think our messenger didn't know
[2:29:05] what's going on
[2:29:09] why would he say it has nothing to do
[2:29:11] with it
[2:29:13] and now all you hear is it has
[2:29:15] everything to do with it
[2:29:27] I didn't come to you
[2:29:29] with enticing words
[2:29:32] but the power and demonstration of the
[2:29:36] Holy Spirit
[2:29:41] yeah
[2:29:42] a couple bird can count
[2:29:45] just as much as the rest of them
[2:29:48] I've seen heathens rise and shout and
[2:29:52] speak in tongues and drink blood out of
[2:29:54] a human skull and call on devils so you
[2:29:59] any of them Sensations
[2:30:03] and things
[2:30:04] forget it
[2:30:08] it's your heart
[2:30:14] listen what he says
[2:30:16] all those sensation and things
[2:30:19] forget it
[2:30:20] is your heart in that word
[2:30:27] and that's Christ
[2:30:33] bring in there
[2:30:35] and watch it make itself known
[2:30:40] just as it opens up like any other seed
[2:30:45] it declares itself for the age we're
[2:30:50] living in
[2:30:55] therefore the message calls the bride
[2:30:58] together the shout
[2:31:00] the same one
[2:31:02] he with the loud voice he screams out
[2:31:05] the shout and the voice that woke
[2:31:08] Lazarus with a loud voice he cries
[2:31:10] Lazarus forth The Voice wakes up the
[2:31:13] sleeping bride
[2:31:16] amen and amen and I'll just leave it
[2:31:19] there because this is how he says she
[2:31:22] has to model
[2:31:24] and
[2:31:26] she has to be molded and made into the
[2:31:30] image of Christ and Christ is the word
[2:31:34] that's the only thing see
[2:31:37] it's in there in the word there cannot
[2:31:42] be one thing added it cannot be a woman
[2:31:45] with one hand like a man and the other
[2:31:49] hand
[2:31:50] what like Paul like a dog it's got to be
[2:31:54] exactly word of the Lord like he is the
[2:31:58] word the bride is part of the bridegroom
[2:32:00] the woman is part of her husband because
[2:32:04] she's taken out of her husband Eve was
[2:32:08] part of Adam from his side so the bride
[2:32:12] not taken from a denomination but taken
[2:32:15] from the bosom of the word of God for
[2:32:19] this day
[2:32:20] the rapture
[2:32:23] how beautiful
[2:32:26] how beautiful of what you are part of
[2:32:30] the word
[2:32:34] think of it the word has come
[2:32:38] through the mouth of a prophet
[2:32:41] in a message
[2:32:44] to the bride what was the message
[2:32:48] this Shout
[2:32:51] the beginning of the rapture
[2:32:54] the calling of the Bride
[2:32:58] bringing her together
[2:33:00] in invisible Union between Christ and
[2:33:04] the bride what was this message we
[2:33:06] received from this prophet
[2:33:09] that was Vindicated
[2:33:13] that opened the seals
[2:33:17] provided a word to give us a revelation
[2:33:21] with no leaven in it
[2:33:25] and directive to you
[2:33:28] the revelation of the rapture
[2:33:32] to give to you the Revelation it's only
[2:33:35] for you
[2:33:36] that you could possess it
[2:33:42] not be looking for it
[2:33:47] to get through the deception
[2:33:52] it gave you a method to get through the
[2:33:54] deception
[2:33:56] how am I going to discern this anointing
[2:34:02] does it line up with what he says
[2:34:09] if someone says well the seals were
[2:34:12] opened in the first age
[2:34:15] ding
[2:34:24] what was restored
[2:34:28] the unadulterated word of God
[2:34:32] what what what was what was the final
[2:34:34] conclusion
[2:34:37] he says all the sensations he said
[2:34:40] forget it
[2:34:44] that's him
[2:34:45] forget it is your heart in the word
[2:34:52] asked yourself this morning
[2:34:56] has something robbed your heart from the
[2:34:59] word
[2:35:00] is your heart in the word I love this
[2:35:03] word I love this voice I love this
[2:35:07] Storehouse I love this food it's where
[2:35:10] my Revelation for the Rapture is coming
[2:35:12] from
[2:35:13] it's where I'm going to be molded into
[2:35:16] His Image because of the same spirit
[2:35:18] that was in him is in me it'll Quicken
[2:35:22] my mortal body
[2:35:27] my anchor holds
[2:35:30] in the storm
[2:35:33] what a challenge
[2:35:35] for this age
[2:35:40] that the anointing
[2:35:43] the very anointing itself
[2:35:47] would be the test
[2:35:51] and deception
[2:35:54] of the true and false fine
[2:36:01] unbelievable
[2:36:03] but yet
[2:36:07] he revealed to us
[2:36:10] exactly what we would be facing
[2:36:14] okay
[2:36:18] now where's my soul rest
[2:36:22] I'm anchored
[2:36:23] in the Haven of Rest
[2:36:27] I've anchored my life
[2:36:30] in The Voice
[2:36:31] of God's messenger for this age
[2:36:34] this Holy Bible
[2:36:37] revealed in its season
[2:36:41] what was sealed up in here has been made
[2:36:44] known to me
[2:36:46] and this is where I rest
[2:36:51] that's what I know
[2:36:54] I know if that's my heart is in that
[2:36:57] word
[2:36:59] my anointing is true
[2:37:02] otherwise I can't tell it apart
[2:37:07] no evidence
[2:37:10] not the heaven
[2:37:12] the evidence is the nature of Christ
[2:37:15] and Christ always
[2:37:17] amends
[2:37:20] the word
[2:37:22] church I beg you
[2:37:27] make the rapture
[2:37:30] a serious
[2:37:32] serious
[2:37:33] part of your life
[2:37:39] the revelation of the rapture
[2:37:41] is contained in the third poll
[2:37:46] Feast on it
[2:37:48] and live
[2:37:50] bring your life in subjection to it
[2:37:54] when he talks about gossip get rid of
[2:37:57] gossip
[2:37:58] when he talks about life bring yourself
[2:38:00] subject
[2:38:02] to the word of God don't tape a
[2:38:05] substitute
[2:38:07] if you're blessed praise God you're
[2:38:09] blessed
[2:38:12] when your Nature's change some Shout
[2:38:16] some Fallen wheat
[2:38:19] some are speechless
[2:38:22] some just worship
[2:38:25] the transformation is so real
[2:38:28] but remember
[2:38:30] one of the mysteries of this age is that
[2:38:33] you can receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:38:35] Ghost without sensation
[2:38:39] he said forget it
[2:38:42] you go read it listen to The Rapture
[2:38:47] it's a message
[2:38:49] strictly
[2:38:51] for the elect lady
[2:38:53] and it follows a message called
[2:38:55] leadership
[2:38:57] and things that are to be and as the
[2:39:00] prophet of God closed up
[2:39:02] his life and his message he had finished
