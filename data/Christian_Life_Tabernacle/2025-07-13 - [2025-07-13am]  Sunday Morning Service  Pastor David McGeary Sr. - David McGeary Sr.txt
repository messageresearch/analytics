I was reading this in the church age book before service. Just wanted to share it with the church. Says, "Don't fear little flock. All that I am, you are heir to. All my power is yours. My omnipotence is yours. As I stand in the midst, I have not come to bring fear and failure, but love, courage, and ability. Do you need any love, courage, and ability? You're in the right place. All power is given unto me, and it is yours to use. Speak the word and I will perform it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is my covenant and it can never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. [Music] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father. Lord, truly your word and your promises are yay and amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're gathered here in promise, Lord, that where two or three are gathered in your name, you will be in the midst. Lord, in where you are there is liberty. Where you are there is the supernatural. Lord, if any of us are honest with ourselves, [Music] Lord, we know how bad we need you. Lord, we know how bad we need you in everything, Lord. Whether we need healing, whether we need deliverance, salvation, Lord, you're the answer to it all. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just come to you as a needy people, asking Lord that you would do that which you've already promised. Lord, that you'd set free the captive, heal the sick, bind up the brokenhearted. Lord, we ask that we would receive whatever it is that you'd have for us today, Lord. For we know that you're the giver of every good gift. &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you. We invite you. We adore you. We praise you for all that you've done. And we look forward, Lord, to that which you're doing right now. We just ask that you'd have the preeminence in this service, Lord, but especially have the preeminence in every heart. May we put aside everything else, Lord, and worship you. We love you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Why don't you just greet uh your neighbor? Welcome somebody to the house of the Lord. As we just grab our Bibles and we turn to Psalms 27. Just come on my heart. Amen.

Amen. and I'll I'll read the first verse and uh congregation the second and we'll do uh likewise until the end joining on the last verse. Amen. Praise the Lord. We'll give those a moment as they turn. It's nice to hear the Bibles turning and the pages being turned. Amen. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? &gt;&gt; Though in host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. The war should rise against me. In this will I be confident. I seek dwell in his temple. &gt;&gt; For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. here.

Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart. Wait, I say on the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. You may have your seats. I wanted to sing that song, Leaning on the Everlasting Arms.

Amen. Bless the wonderful name of the Lord. You may be seated. Hallelujah. It's so good to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just want to use up this use this time to take up the tithes and the offerings. So, the brothers that are prepared to do that, uh we do have some prayer requests. Uh but before we go into those, I I do want to make an announcement. Um we're uh excited to be able to have our our uh youth Labor Day meetings again, which we'll have a banquet um Friday uh August 29th. And we will be sending out a form for reservations for those that would like to attend. We need to uh be able to do a headcount. We're excited to have brother Jason Watkins and his son Matthew Watkins with us uh to to u be the speakers for our meeting. So I'm just in great expectation for that. So youth spread the word. We certainly want to welcome um uh visitors and friends and uh brothers and sisters from other churches um to come. And so I I don't know about you, but I'm just starting to build an expectation. It's just a going to be a wonderful time of fellowship. And I I pray that the youth are starting to get excited about it. and you want to invite some friends. And for those that are traveling in, we do like to try to um accommodate and make sure people have a place to stay. So on that form, there'll be a a section there that um you can if you're this is home for you, you'll let us know. And then if visitors are traveling in, if if you're sending out the form or letting friends know if they need a place to stay, there's a place to mark on there as well that says uh they need a place. And then um if you can let myself or uh brother Billy know if you'd like to be a host to uh maybe uh be able to put up some of the youth that'll be traveling in. We'll start getting an account for that. So we're just looking forward to that. And also we just want to uh brother uh Neville just asked the church to be in prayer uh for his wife at this time. And brother Adrian uh turned in a a request. He's just asking uh prayer for uh Sister Cindy. Uh but you know she's battling sickness in the body and but here brother Adrian's testifying and saying that thank you for the love and faith in our Lord Jesus who has defeated the enemy in our minds and our body even before it began. And I stand together with him and just want to continue to hold uh uh Sister Cindy up in prayer. Um there's been many battles in the body, but we we serve a God who's able to come on the scene in a in in a moment. And I believe that if we can just start taking up and uh these burdens, you know, if if it was your wife, you'd pray a little bit different. And and I believe a believer can come under a burden, get away in the presence of the Lord, and you can just be overwhelmed and start to bear somebody's burden, and it makes a difference. I I appreciate those who have prayed for me because it it makes a difference. We need one another. Amen. He also has another uh request, brother Adrian wrote for his cousin Lety who uh her brother passed in a car crash and then also her husband had a heart attack. And so we're just asking that God would come on the scene and that they would be able to uh in the midst of this great agony and trial that God could come to them and that they would know that he can be a comforter during these times. Amen. Let's just go before the Lord. Lord Jesus, you're great Jehovah Gyra. You're our provider. Lord, you do all things well. And many times we might not understand circumstances or why afflictions might linger in the body and the enemy challenges us and tells us that we don't have faith, Lord. But we know faith comes by hearing the word and that faith is a gift. And as believers, Lord, that's all we can do is believe and stand upon your word. And when we've done all to stand, we continue to stand. Lord, if an infirmity or a promise seems like it hasn't been manifested for 6 months, one year, 5 years, 10 years, however long, Satan is defeated and your word is true. And Lord, we'll be like Abraham. We'll stagger not at your promise. We'll be strong in faith, giving you praise and glory, Lord, because you're the one that gave the promise and you're faithful to perform it. So Lord, we ask that you would move on behalf of these needs, Lord, for our precious sister Cindy. Lord, I I pray that you would just move upon her right now, Lord. May there even be a reprieve that would just come in and lift any pain or any discomfort, Lord. And Lord, that the enemy would be chased far away, Father. That there would be healing flow from Calvary into that body, Lord. in your stripes that we are healed by would just be manifested so quickly, Father, that she would stand to just testify once again of your healing grace and mercy, Lord. And Lord, we know that you're more than able. And we thank you, Father, for the promise and for the testimony of our brother Adrian. Lord, his cousin that is suffering a great loss, Lord, her losing her husband and Lord and just certain Lord, the one that had the heart attack, Lord, you know exactly how it was written. Father, we pray that you would move upon them, Lord, and comfort them during this time, Lord. maybe not a lost loved one as the the prayer request said, but a a serious need, maybe a heart attack and a a a car crash and they they need a a healing touch, Lord. So, Father, we pray that you would just move upon them, Lord. And may you begin to build them up and strengthen them, but but may they know that something happened. May you just move upon them, Lord. And may they start looking unto you for their healing, for their peace, Lord, and realize that everything else in the world is just darkness and death, but in you, Lord, there's life and hope and peace, Lord. We also pray for uh brother Neville turned in the request for his wife. We just ask that you would touch her in a special way, Lord. Father, all those that aren't here with us, Lord. We commit them to you. We continue to remember Brother Billy as he's away ministering. Lord, may you continue to strengthen him and and Lord, we love and appreciate him so much. just pray that you bring them back safely, Lord. Father, for the tithes and the offerings, we ask a a blessing upon those, Lord, in the remainder of this service. In your name, the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. [Music] Oh preious blood stain. Oh, they were made there just for me. For all of my sins, my sickness. [Music] When I need [Music] I preious blood. I claim the blood will I have brother Ben come for a song special on Calaryious [Music] blood. Oh they were made there just for me.

And we fight and we struggle. And yet, Father, you know what we have need of even before we ask. Father, we ask that you would bless us this morning and be with us in a mighty way this morning as we fellowship around your word today. In Jesus precious and holy name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles and you'd like to open up with me just to read one uh quick scripture this morning found in James uh the uh second uh 2 and 18 of the Gospel of James. Um very very familiar scripture uh to many of us. It says and so we'll just read 17 and 18. He said if it says even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone. Yeah. A man may say thou hath faith and I have works. Show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless your word to us. In your precious name we pray. Amen. God bless. You may be seated this morning. It's certainly wonderful to be in the house of the Lord today and uh to welcome you in. I see the Rams I think have finally made it here to Texas. So we welcome you this morning and God bless you so much. Uh we want to uh speak to you a little bit this morning out of a message called uh works as faith expressed. And in doing so this morning, we're going to take a few moments and play about 25 minutes of this message to you. and uh and it's and the portion we're going to play I I we want to take some things off the back end of it, but as you begin to listen to it, I I want you to see as our prophet expressed to us what it takes to hang on to faith. And I really think it'll be a blessing to you. Um, and so I'd like to kind of build up to that this morning because really what's been on our heart is we've been on this journey for a long time. Uh, we've recognized the word of God for the hour. We we we noticed in our day that we've came to the end times. everything about the scriptures uh and the description of the hour that we live in that was spoken of in God's word, we were able to look around us and recognize the day that we're in. Uh it's very easy for us to recognize that we're in the times of Sodom and Gamora. We're the our condition is as it was in the days of Noah. So we can sit back and look at that and and see the uh the moral condition of the land. We can see the the things that are are taking place and it becomes a time clock to us. We be we're able to say uh this is where where we are. This is the time that we're in. And then we were able to recognize the the day that we lived in and the message to that day. And the message to our day was to come out from amongst them and be ye separate. &gt;&gt; And and and so sometimes we we forget the part that God's word calls for total separation from unbelief. And uh and as so as we we saw the word of God unfold and we we we saw that according to Malachi 4:5 in the before the great and dreadful day of the Lord before the final judgment of the Lord that God was going to send a ministry back to restore our faith back to the faith of the fathers. And so there there had to be an existing faith for us to be restored back to. In other words, we weren't here to generate our new faith. We weren't here to come up with a new form of faith or a new way of thinking or a new approach. We were go going to be brought back to what made our fathers believe the way that they believed that there there was something that took place in our fathers before us those before us of like precious faith. uh if I could say that our our our kindred uh our fellow believers that were in ages before, every age had a group of believers. And so those that were believers in the ages before us, they had a faith and that faith was given to them by God. So that faith remains the same. It's it's not a different faith. It's the original faith. It's the faith that our fathers had. And we that's what the the message came for. Malacha for came to restore to us the faith that our fathers had. It also came to us to reveal to us the son of predition to show us all the spiritual lies, the religious lies, the social lies, the political lies, all the uh negativity that has surrounded the church that is trying to destroy uh that faith or to hide that faith or to cloud held that faith up. And so it it came to reveal that and as we saw it it unveiled the the real secret behind denominations. It unveiled uh the moral condition, the political condition, education and science that all these things are of the devil. So these things came out to uh and if he tried to show, if I could say this, reveal to us the things that were trying to blind us from seeing the truth &gt;&gt; and and and to call us out. And also we realized that in this day that there was a hour that there would be mysteries revealed to us. Things that were hid from all the believers in every other age that they they struggled to uh achieve and they struggled to see. But they were hid. They were sealed up. and men tried to open them themselves through their own understanding and they just couldn't put the picture together just right. They they would end up they would get most of it right and then when they were all done with their picture they had a cow sitting in top of a tree or they had something wrong here. they just didn't have the key to put it all together. And and part of that was because they believed in three gods and and as long as they had that three god thinking that it the things wouldn't come together. So the godhead had to be revealed to us. uh people were uh accepting emotion as a uh uh belief that that was the spirit of God, what the Holy Spirit was. And we know that uh that what the spirit of God is the power of God given to the believer to believe every word of God. And so we've come down this road and we we began to see it. And so we come to uh begin to ask ourselves, what lies ahead for the believer? Or may I say it like this, what what would God expect of us after all that he's done for us? &gt;&gt; What kind of believer should we be? &gt;&gt; What kind of Christian should we be? what what would be our evidences or would I would say it this way what would be our works that come by our faith. So, look, if we believe the things that we've seen that God's done, that he has sent to us, uh, Malachi 4:5, that the the the prophet of Malachi 4:5 came on the scene and he vindicated that he was that prophet by the works that he had done. &gt;&gt; It was the evidence that's who that he was. So he I could say that I'm something but then if I if if I have a description right that if if this person comes he will do this and he will do that and he will do that and then I come and I do this and I do that and I fulfill the description of me then it's a good possibility that I am what they said that I would be. And so we've seen that. So now we ask that what kind of faith should we ask? So there's two things that should be the attributes of the church of the living God going forward. And those attributes, if I could say that should be love. One, the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. And the second attribute should be by faith. &gt;&gt; So the the the church going forward should possess two distinctive works &gt;&gt; that identify who that she is. So we say that we are the bride. So if we are the bride and we're one with the bridegroom, isn't that what we be? that there's been a union. &gt;&gt; Then the our works are the proof of the union. &gt;&gt; We can say that I can say I'm a doctor. Does anybody would come over? I'd like to operate on you. I can get the coat on. I can put this stethoscope on. You know what I mean? I can put a scaffold in my hand and I can look at you and said, "Oh, would you like me to remove your appendix?" Now, you'd want a little more vindication, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I love about this message. It's vindicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. He just didn't say God was a healer. We watch the blind be. We watch the dead come to life. the blind see. Everything that they gave the record to John, he said, "Is this he?" Jesus said, "Go back and tell him the works of the Messiah are being done." &gt;&gt; So, he didn't point even to his own words. Jesus didn't just point to his own words. He said, "If you can't believe me for my word's sake, believe me for my works." because they identify me of who I am. &gt;&gt; So if we are claiming to be the bride, &gt;&gt; then our works ought to identify our faith. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And so there ought to be two attributes that the church has going forward. There's one. They should have the love of God shed abroad in their hearts. Why? Because love is the capstone. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And they should have faith. Go forward. They should be be evidently believing the word of God that was fulfilled in their day. but not another day but believing the word of God that was fulfilled in their day. So, so what what our path forward is if we need to obtain the attributes that identify us that we have the credentials to perform the work that the bride is given to perform in this day. &gt;&gt; Now, you have a job to do. &gt;&gt; You have a work to do. you you you've been placed and positioned for a reason, &gt;&gt; you know, and and I don't even know how many ministers we have in the church. I'm I'm going to have a meeting so I can find out because we want to give everybody an opportunity that that that feels they have a a call in their life. But God's gifts make a way. God makes a way for his gifts. So, you know, he's got a a purpose in putting us here. We're not put here without a purpose. There's a reason for our existence. There's a job that we have to do. There was something that God put on display. Even he told us, "Let our lights so shine amongst men that our good works might glorify the father which is in heaven." And if we don't, we become a people of theology instead of a people of life. &gt;&gt; We believe this, we believe that, we believe this. Our doctrine's correct, we baptized right, we got this teaching right, we got that and that. But yet, there's nothing that goes beyond the borders of this building. In our own lives, there's nothing that goes beyond the borders of our our self-existence. And we want to be able to extend ourselves outside the borders of our self-existence into the world and the realms around us that the works and light of God's word might shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's getting dark. and you are the light. &gt;&gt; There's no voice. And you are the voice. And our spirits and our nature have to begin to identify with our calling. And it it's hard because one, we've got to get the world out of our life. and we got to work on that. So there there's there's no condemnation in anything that I'm saying. I'm not trying to point out faults this morning, not trying to point out weaknesses because I believe we have a God that if we can get our faith anchored in the right thing, he can take care of all of our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; I just want to have a vision and and and without a vision the people perish. &gt;&gt; And without a vision, the people start running here and there and hither and they run after this and they run after that and everything that glows and shines and comes up with something that seems like it's happening over here. They run over here and they run over there and then you see people being tossed to and fro running here and there and oh there's a revival going on here and they run over there and the revival goes &gt;&gt; there's no revival. We've had our revival. &gt;&gt; You understand? Now it's soldier time. &gt;&gt; Now it's time to stand up and fight the good fight of faith. And now it's time to be the voice of God in this last day, the last voice to this last generation. It's time for us to do the works that he did &gt;&gt; and we want to move towards that. So our path forward is we need to grab a hold and latch on to the love of God. &gt;&gt; And and that love we love him because what? He first loved us. &gt;&gt; It's not something we did. You just don't decide to love God &gt;&gt; because human nature is to love yourself before you love God. &gt;&gt; You love him because he first loved you. And you have faith because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Faith is a gift of God, lest any man should boast. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we we've got to accept the fact that we've been called. &gt;&gt; You've got to accept the fact you've heard. Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; He believed what God showed him and told him. Was Abra was Abraham's righteousness attributed to him for righteousness? No. The fact that he believed God even though he went through doubts and everything, the anchor held. I'd like to just make a few statements and then we'll play our portion. And I in order to I I trust to uh bring to you the kind of steadfastness that it takes and is going to take in this hour for us to meet the challenge of the hour. And remember that's what our messenger told us. He said, "The trouble with the denominational gospel and the and the man-made gospel is it will not meet the challenge of the hour." &gt;&gt; In other words, it won't defeat the enemy. You're not going to bluff Satan. &gt;&gt; You understand you, you know, and there's only two things that you can do. You can become a snail or an ostrich &gt;&gt; or a turtle. You know what I mean? You'll just pull up in your shell. Is that right? And the prophet of God said when that happens, what Holy Spirit needs to do is light a good fire underneath you to make you come out of your shell to pull your head out of the sand. &gt;&gt; You understand? to to not pull up into your shell and step out and say, "I've got to go forward. &gt;&gt; I can't stay like this. I can't continue to think like this. I can't be a continue to be defeated like this. I can't be able to be put down like this. I I can't I can't just not get the victory. It comes to a time I've got to make some progress. &gt;&gt; And I want to make progress. &gt;&gt; I want to be better than I am. I want to have faith. &gt;&gt; I want to see the works following me. &gt;&gt; I don't want fame. I want to give glory to the message that stood out and delivered me from the darkness of this hour. &gt;&gt; I don't want position. &gt;&gt; People that grab position presume without authority. &gt;&gt; Who wants that? We don't need that. &gt;&gt; We don't have anything that's our own anyway. So we want to go forward. He says he makes this statement. Now let's just stop there just a minute. Sometimes we misunderstand this. People gets emotion and they try to work on emotion. That won't work. It don't work. A lot of people have been finding that out lately the hard way. They got all excited and they didn't have no place to go with their excitement. &gt;&gt; You can only run around the building so many times. &gt;&gt; You can only sing and shout and dance so much, &gt;&gt; but it don't move you down the road. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that'll move you down the road and that's the revelation of God's word. &gt;&gt; So we we we we we see that you know and then he makes this statement. He says he says he said you know sometimes you know a person he says we allow it sometimes say well this guy didn't have enough faith and this guy didn't do this and this guy didn't do that. There's a reason there for that. There's a reason. So you know there's got to be a reason. God doesn't do anything without a reason or without a purpose. Everything's laid down in God's plan just perfectly. And he's trying to get us to get the vision vision of that plan. &gt;&gt; And when we see that plan, then we operate according to what God has showed us. not our emotion, not a workup, but it goes forward a a way that God has showed it to us. He said, "Now, now faith, and I know we say this a million times, okay, but let me be honest with you. I've heard this a million times, and the light bulbs just starting to come on. Forgive me for being a dim wit, you know, and you, you know, maybe you've endured a second grade preacher all this time, but hey, you would want the light to come on for me just right to listen to this. And I I it just all of a sudden I begin to see the simplicity of it because if we're going to have faith, we have to have the faith that our fathers had. Not us trying to muster up, not the preachers trying to muster up to come up with a new definition of faith &gt;&gt; or some other kind of faith or trying to substitute emotion. If you believe this, if you believe that, if you were a believer, &gt;&gt; well, you know what I say about ifs, ands, if, buts, and wise are all Satan's lies. There ain't no if about it. You find me on the gutter down on skid row with a bottle in my hand, that is not going to take my name off the Lamb's book of life. I might be backslid. I might lose every single one of my rewards. But all that the Father hath given me &gt;&gt; will come. &gt;&gt; I just want to have more love in my heart than that. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have that to be my backs stop. Oh, I'm predestinated. Well, forget it. Show me you're predestinated. Prove to me you're predestinated. Prove to me you have the love of God in your heart. Your works identify. It shows the union's been there. &gt;&gt; So I need I want to get to the tape that not keep you so long. Now faith is a revelation from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh from God. &gt;&gt; Now, faith is a revelation. There's where I want to stay there just a moment. Now, he's preaching this in 1965 after all the divine healing he's been through, after every proof and everything, people raising up for him everything. And then he finally turns around and tells him, "Hey, in order to have faith, you have to have a revelation." And when we play the tape, I want you to catch what the revelation is to the church that's going to allow them to go forward. They have to have an anchor place. They have to have a word. Can't be a word from another day. It has to be the something word that identifies the day and identifies the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to show you that you are a part of the union. &gt;&gt; This union between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. It's got to be something to you personally that God does for you, shows you personally that is revealed from you that it came from him. Not something you heard and then you're going to try to line up to &gt;&gt; or or not some teaching about faith that you're going to try to grab a hold of and work yourself into. Oh, no, no, no. Faith is a revelation from God. &gt;&gt; Now, if you haven't had one, don't beat yourself in the ground. Pray for one. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Pray for revelation. &gt;&gt; The greatest thing for the church is divine revelation. &gt;&gt; You want your kids saved? Pray to God. to give you a revelation. &gt;&gt; Once you stand up and say, "I know my kids are saved, &gt;&gt; you know what'll happen? Your works will start following that and your works will create an atmosphere and the atmosphere will have an effect on your kids. You'll quit condemning them. You'll quit beating them over the head. You'll quit screaming at them and everything. You'll just say, "Sweetie, go ahead tonight. Just wait till God gets a hold of you. You know judgment's coming, darling. I prayed for you." Now, faith is there's where I want to stay there for a moment. It's a revelation. He has revealed it to you by his grace. It's nothing you did. You didn't work yourself up into faith. You ever have faith? It's given to you by the grace of God. God revealed it to you. Therefore, faith is a revelation and the whole church of God is built upon the revelation. It's something that God gives you. Abraham didn't work himself up into becoming the father of nations. &gt;&gt; Abraham's just pooing around, you know, and God comes down and says,"Abraham, I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." Abraham's going, "What? Yeah, you and Sarah are going to have a child." He says, "I'm 80, man. You know, we're dead." But the scripture said he didn't what? Never considered it, &gt;&gt; right? But he believed what God revealed to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And from there forth he started building knitting the booties and building this and everything and he begin to testify and there he go. Oh hey father of nations. You know he kept getting older and the promise kept getting further away. Right? But he held on to one thing. Not his emotion, &gt;&gt; one thing. &gt;&gt; God revealed it to him. &gt;&gt; Now, let me say this. Every single person in here this morning is entitled to revelation. &gt;&gt; You have not because you asked not. Knock and it shall be open. &gt;&gt; Seek and you shall find. &gt;&gt; Don't try to do it. Muster it up. If you ain't got it, you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; Okay. But the beautiful thing is is you can ask for it. And if you ask in no wise will he cast you out. &gt;&gt; He says now in the audience of people where a pray prayer line comes through you'll find some they were all good people. will say there are some that's trying hard to believe it, trying to work themselves into it. Some just can't do it at all and others it's just by grace. It's just given to them. Now, there's the difference. See, that does it. That's the real re revelation because faith is a revelation from God. It must be revealed first. So, in other words, we believe in divine healing. Well, we don't just keep calling people up saying, "God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. Get well. Get well. Get well." &gt;&gt; We don't have to do that. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. What we need is we need divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the word of God. It's not a hope. So really you people come and say, "Brother Mer, I'd like you to lay your hands on me. Pray for him. I'm sick." Lord bless this poor sick person. You know what I mean? But if they could get a revelation, if God could show them, it's not doctrine. &gt;&gt; You understand? It's not a doctrine. It's not a belief that you can get a hold of. Satan believes &gt;&gt; and fears and tremble. &gt;&gt; It's not your belief that's the part that works. It's God showing you. That's the part that works. That that that's it. We know he's a healer. We know the doctrines. We know the teachings. But what we've gotten away from is is the revelation of God delivering that to us personally. So if we keep our relationship clean, he can speak to us. But he's not going to vindicate a a lousy life. Oh, we've been whooping the people up with emotions, with songs, with, you know, people falling out. I've seen so many people fall out, you can't believe it. Nowhere in the word of God does it say that anybody got well from falling out or got the Holy Ghost from falling out or doing any of those things. Are they great? Yeah, they're great for us. I enjoy the spirit. I enjoy the anointing. But remember one thing. There's false anointed ones. &gt;&gt; The anointing doesn't move. The rain falls on the just and the unjust. But God moves his church by divine revelation. He heals you by revelation. &gt;&gt; Not by proving to you he's a healer, but by revealing to you here's your healing. &gt;&gt; Lord, I know you have this now. Father, reveal to me. Show me by your grace. give it that I can now by your word and by your spirit I can take possession. I've been trying to take possession of this Lord every day crying and calling and and wanting to grab a hold of it. But the key is not in my hands. It's in his hands and he's got to reveal it. Can you imagine when our church turns its eyes away from trying to produce wool and starts being moved by divine revelation? where we finally have a body of believers where every believer within their own framework of their own life has God said so God told me you can have it your inheritance don't look for the power for the revelation he that he says is just by grace given to them. Now that's the difference. That does it. That's a real revelation because faith is a revelation from God. It must be revealed first. Jesus clearly expressed this when he said, "No man can come to me except the father draws him first or reveals me to him first." And and let's just turn in that real quick and then we're going to get right into playing the the tape. But if if if you will turn with me to uh St. John 6 and 45 and you can put that on the board. To me, this was has been a hidden scripture that all of a sudden has just come alive. It is written in the prophets. Right? So this is what he's saying. This is it is written. Okay? And they shall all they shall be all taught of God. Right? So it's written, they shall all be taught of God. In other words, it will be revealed from God of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh to me. taught of the father, learned of the father, drawn of the father. &gt;&gt; God doing the work, God revealing. Look, we've got a church now. Am I okay? &gt;&gt; We have a church now that killing themselves, trying to produce wool, trying to produce work, trying to produce gifts, trying to produce signs and wonders, trying to find their own identity. But you don't have to find your identity. God will identify you. &gt;&gt; God will identify you. Don't beat yourself down. You say, "I'm a wreck, man. I can hardly live." Right? If you're his, God will identify you. &gt;&gt; He will give you the revelation. &gt;&gt; He will come to you. You will be taught of the father. So you see, it takes the man out of it. And now God's dealing with you and your heart and your heart's desire. You have a desire in your heart. My Bible says that God gives you the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Don't seek after the desire. Seek after the giver. &gt;&gt; Seek after the revelation. Seek after the relationship of God speaking to you and you speaking back to God &gt;&gt; and make your choice, the world or him. He says in St. John 6:44-46. They didn't know who he was. They thought he was just an ordinary man. They thought he was just as people does today, some prophet. He was a prophet. He was an ordinary man. But there was more to that, more than that. And when did Peter know there was more than that? when the father revealed it to him. Thou art the son of the living God. Amen. So now let's just I want to read one more statement to you and u and because so so we can place our ourselves. Now we're talking about faith this morning, right? So we're talking about revelation. What is the effect of divine revelation on the believer? Right? Because the effect of divine revelation is going to identify the works that follow, right? No wavering. So Abraham's gets this revelation, right? that he's going to be a father right now. I I it's a great story, but you think it'd been okay if God would show it, right? But it was impossible. Is that right? The situation was impossible. Our problem is not not your problem. My problem is I always think in the realms of possibility. I always think that in a way that yes, it's possible. And I so I begin to think in the realms of possibility. Yes, it could happen this way or it could happen that way or it could happen this way. But there was no way for Abraham to make it happen happen. &gt;&gt; He was dead and Sarah's womb was gone. &gt;&gt; Okay? No possibility. You see, God is trying to raise us out of the realm of possibility into the realms of impossible. &gt;&gt; Is it possible? And you, it don't matter if it's possible. If he revealed it to me, &gt;&gt; it's the end of the matter. My faith is built on the revelation, not my intellectual trying to squeeze and hold on to a promise. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of that promise becoming personal. All the promises in the book are mine. &gt;&gt; But Revelation is God's time piece that says this is the time that this promise is for you. Did that did you let me read it to you? Okay. Now we are the children of Abraham. Hallelujah. Not as Isaac was, but his royalty through Jesus Christ by the faith that he had. Abraham's seed cometh forth in the last days to shine like that star. Abraham's children considered not his own body now dead. Neither considered it. It wasn't even brought into question whether God could do it or not. God said he would do it. Why? It was revealed to him. Is that right? And when it's revealed to you, when it something you really can't make it happen, it's got to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; You can't make it happen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we would quit trying to make our healing happen, &gt;&gt; we can't make it happen. The church is trying to make it happen. If we would fall in step, get humble. Let God start leading us by his spirit. Giving us revelation. I don't care how bad you are. It's the revelation that takes you from bad to good. &gt;&gt; It's not you taking yourself from bad to good. I didn't choose one day to be a Christian. Believe me, &gt;&gt; I if God would have asked me, "Do you want to be a Christian?" I would say, "Lord, I got plenty of dope in my closet. I love my rock and roll music. I know everybody. I'm happy." He said, "There's only one problem, son. You're going to learn what you have to suffer for the kingdom's sake. &gt;&gt; You can't kick against the prick." &gt;&gt; Well, can't you all say that about yourself? &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have been here if it wouldn't have been for God. &gt;&gt; You You didn't choose him. &gt;&gt; He chose you. Right? &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now, you might be young today and your parents might drag you here. God bless the parents that drag you here. This kid over here used to sit on the back pew of the You know how long's this going to go on? You you know what I mean? Davey was over there chasing in church. You know, they didn't want to go to church. &gt;&gt; But I had a promise. If I'd raise them in the way that they were to go, &gt;&gt; they would return. &gt;&gt; Now, you might have a kid that's not there yet, &gt;&gt; but you get God to reveal that to you. &gt;&gt; Then it's lights out for that poor soul. He said he couldn't do it. Why? It was revealed to him. When it's revealed to you, when when when it really something you can't make it happen, it's got to be revealed to you. You don't even consider anything else. How impossible it is. Don't consider what the doctor said. You don't consider what mama said, what papa said, what the preacher said, what anybody else said. You just consider what God said. &gt;&gt; So you don't try to think in the realms of possibility. It doesn't matter. If God revealed to you something totally impossible, you don't consider. Right. Right. It's the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen. you don't consider anything else. &gt;&gt; So God's trying to rise us up because we're thinking in re religious realms. We're thinking in modern realms. We're thinking in the realms of this day. And God wants us to start thinking impossible. &gt;&gt; Somebody come in here and show me how you're going to rapture. The rapture is impossible. &gt;&gt; And yet, every single one of us has this hope for it. But the rapture is a revelation. I think that's a good revelation to pray for right there &gt;&gt; because if you get that revelation, it is going to change the way you live. &gt;&gt; And you got to make one decision. Is that rapture &gt;&gt; worth everything that this world has to offer? You say, "Well, I don't know if I got that revelation." Pray for it. &gt;&gt; Ask God to reveal it to you. It's time. If if it's rapturing time, if we're reaching the end, if all the signs are pointing it to us, then that revelation has to exist. for the church. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I want that revelation so bad. Can I say this? I need divine revelation. &gt;&gt; I need God to start revelating my heart and my mind. I need revelation. I got doctrine. There ain't a man in this world that can sit down that I can't discuss the doctrines of William Mary and Brandham with I don't feel I come short of any of them in the knowledge of this message. But knowledge puffth up You become heady and high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. What we need is a people, hearts and lives that are willing to have God reveal himself to. And I don't care how old you are. If you're 12, if you're 13, God's a revealer. He can reveal. If you quit starting to go forward in your life without revelation, all the problems would stop. The world doesn't need to change. We need to change. &gt;&gt; And we need divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. He considered not his own body now dead, neither the deadness of Sarah's womb. It wasn't even brought under consideration. Oh my, that just shakes me. Body dead or the deadness of Sarah's womb or even were not even brought into consideration. No circumstance will be considered when faith finds its bedding ground. Notice the holy faith of God was united with the holy works of his prophet. Remember God's holy faith was revealed to Abraham. He received it. And by there he he started with his holy works by believing the seed of promise had a place to grow. We're trying to jump to the top. We We run off without revelation. We don't let faith grow. For some reason, we think we can just stick ourselves in the message microwave and be popped out a believer. And we sit up here as preachers preaching doctrine and doctrine and doctrine and books and messages and tapes, which you know I believe with every bit of my heart. But nothing's going to happen till each individual starts making a revelation connection with God. We're just sheep in a flock walking with the herd. And each of you are promised a personal individual relationship with the Lord Jesus. These signs shall follow them that believe. If the bedding ground is laying there, when that word drops there, it takes hold. There's nothing can stop it. Now, quickly while we finish, see the seed had a place to hide. God knew it or he would not have never given the promise to Abraham. You understand? He didn't give a promise without there being a bedding ground or a believer for that promise to go to. Now, I want you to catch this part before we play our tape and then we'll close quickly. Now, listen real close. Now, God knew where that promise was going to. He never even called Abraham till he was 75 years old. But he was his predestinated servant from the beginning. So was Sarah. God knew where that seed was going to go. He knew where that revelation was going to go. He knew where you were. He knew you had the bedding ground. But he didn't even call Abraham till he was 75 years old. But yet he was a servant from the beginning. I like that because that means none of anything was laid to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God, the bedding ground, remained in them. &gt;&gt; This morning, you can have a new beginning. &gt;&gt; You can change your life. You can let go of your old creeds and dogmas, your old lifestyle, and start a fresh in the goodness of God. He said this, notice, remember, he had no Bible to read from. He didn't have it as easy as we've got it today to read his word and see others who've took it. Remember, he had to believe by revelation. And that's the real thing. I remember I preached a sermon without the Bible, without books, without tapes. If we didn't have those, what would you have had to rely on? Revelation. &gt;&gt; What is the faith that's restored back to the believer? We've got it mixed up with doctrine. The faith is revelation being restored back to the believer. They couldn't take revelation because they already knew what they believed. &gt;&gt; But there was going to be a people &gt;&gt; that could hear a voice. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That could be restored the relationship of revelation back to the church. They didn't have a Bible that we got to help us along in our crippled condition. They were rugged was revealed to them by God and they stood right there. Nothing moved them. Now, you think that we can still have that rugged faith if it's revealed to you? Now, I I hope that you can endure for 25 more minutes, and I want to show you and have you listen to Rugged Faith, and then I'll keep my comments very brief at the end. I hope you feel the pull this morning. I hope it comes clear to you in your own personal life that God wants to start connecting with you and revealing and showing and leading your life by divine revelation. Quit trying to follow and start being led. Not make our own path, but let him make our path for us. I I really hope this blesses you and I hope you can take it. Listen close at the end when he explains about Malachi 4:51 17:30 just 25 minutes. It's 11:45 quarter after 12. We will done by 12:30. We'll keep our end worship however you guys want it. God bless you our messenger. &gt;&gt; Pardon the expression or the testimony at this time just before closing. I remember up here in Twin Cities. I think brother Brown that was with me. And I was taking the life of Joseph in the Bible and I read that Bible there was a man there was nothing against. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, all of them had something against him. But not Joseph. What a man. A perfect man. A perfect type of Christ. When I read that, I just got to crying one day in my little hotel room and I went over to the closet where I had my clothes hanging, pull the door together. I said, "God, I want to thank you for a man like Joseph. A man who once lived on the earth. A man in flesh like I am. A man that could believe you take your word. He was hated of his brothers. He couldn't help being spiritual. He saw visions. He could interpret dreams. All of them hated him for." He couldn't help that. That's just what he was. See, it just wasn't to the others. They ought to have loved him. But instead of that, when he told him sometimes things against him, oh, they say, "Here comes that dreamer." And they hate him without a cause. I said, "Why did they do that?" And yet that man never moved. He stayed right there. See, I said, "Thank you, Lord. Oh, God. Thank you for such a man." Right then, the Holy Spirit revealed to me, said, "You'll have a son and you'll call his name Joseph." &gt;&gt; I got up from there and thank the Lord. Becky sitting back there had just been born about it. She's about a year old. She's a cecerian that runs into my wife's family. These ceiling because they don't unhinge like the woman should. Your bones are solid like a man. And she had to be cut from her mother. And the doctor told me, he said, "Brother Brandham, don't you never have another child with this woman." Said, "Her womb is as thin as a balloon." He said, "You better let me tie those tubes." I said, "No, I wouldn't don't think about doing that, D." He said, "Well, you you you she shouldn't have another child." Said, "You're going to ruin her." Said, "She'll die." Said, "We had an awful time there." Said, "You just she just did come through. And then the Lord told me I was going to have a son and his name would be called Joseph. I never cared about it. All Many of you remembered. I went forth announced it. I'm going to have a baby. His name's going to be Joseph. How many remembers it? &gt;&gt; Sure. All around the country everywhere telling people going to have a baby. His name's going to be Joseph. Just the same as that little boy was raised up in Finland from the dead. Brother Jack was right there. What happened? Told you two, three years before what happened. If be a little boy, high be dressed. where he be laying. God said so. &gt;&gt; How's it going to be? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was revealed to me that was going to happen. It was revealed to me. I was going to Arizona and that meet seven angels &gt;&gt; and they tell me and a message that I was to preach and that was the seven seals. It happened. &gt;&gt; How many remember seeing that? The tapes before and it happened. &gt;&gt; Magazines, everything else took the picture of it. That light there in the air. They can't even understand it yet. There it was. I remember calling brother Jack and asked him about that Christ being standing there and brother Jack said that's his glorified state. See I love brother Jack he's one of the best theologians I know of but I just couldn't hit this right and standing there I said Lord how is this young man here I said it was hair like wool and he said he is wigged watching the book before it ever happened. I said that and that day when that happened, it went up. Then you turn that picture sideways. If you got Look magazine or Life magazine, turn sideways. There he is. It perfectly. Hoffman's head of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking right down where I was standing. There it is in the magazine. How many's ever seen it? Of course you Oh, see there looking right back. Proved that to the revelation was correct. Why wigged? Why? The old English judges, the Jewish judges used to wear a a a wig. They do yet in England. When he's got supreme authority, he wears a wig and that showed him standing there wig by angel's wings. He is the alpha and omega. He is the supreme devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's none other than him. &gt;&gt; He's to look upon as alpha and omega. And there he was, a young man, no more 30 years old, wearing a wig of white, showing that he was supreme God. &gt;&gt; But Paul has committed all judgment into the hands of the son. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But revelation is never wrong. Speak it anyhow. No matter what it sounds like. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Goes right with the word. &gt;&gt; I remember four years later my wife, we knew we was going to have a baby. Everybody said, "Is this Joseph coming?" I said, "I guess it is. I don't know, but I'm going to have Joseph." When it was born, it was Sarah. Then a man called me up and laughed in my face. He said, "Say, you know what? You meant Josephine." The man died. &gt;&gt; The man died. &gt;&gt; I said, "Sir," I said, "God told me I was going to have a son." And I called his name Joseph. There's three people that left the certain denomination church and come to our church and heard me saying that when Sarah was born, they said, "Huh? He's a false prophet." I said, "Wait a minute, ladies. I never said when." Neither did God say when. He told him he's going to have a he's going to told Abraham he's going to have a Isaac but Ishmael was born in between that time &gt;&gt; but he didn't take it away. &gt;&gt; I said God said I'd have a boy and he call his name Joseph. &gt;&gt; The doctor said when he come up he said reverend I'm going to tie those tubes now. I said I I said don't you do it. &gt;&gt; I he said well you might get married again have that boy your I said I'm going to have it by her. &gt;&gt; God said so. I couldn't read it out of the Bible, but it was wrote on my heart by revelation, by faith. God said so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They want to stagger the promise of God through unbelief. Some of them said, "You meant Josephine." I said, "I meant Joseph." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doctor said, "She can't have another baby." I said, "She will have another baby." &gt;&gt; Four years passed. &gt;&gt; Finally, she's going to be mother again. Then a woman of false prophecy sent forth across the country writing words saying I'm mean he's going to die during this time because I was sent to lead Bill and said that uh and he won't listen to me because I'm a woman and God's going to get even with you now by killing his wife. I said God sent Jesus Christ to lead me. &gt;&gt; I said I'm led by the spirit. Part of the media we had a nurse that's been healed there in the meetings. You all know Mrs. Morgan, one of Mayo's nurses. the worst case of what she's on the record dead about 20 years ago of cancer sycomus cancer in Louisville right on the Baptist hospital record she's nursing in and Jefferson Mill the hospital now she's been there for all these years because God said she'd live &gt;&gt; and so immediately loved her and she said I want Margie to come with me Bill I don't feel like going to the hospital I said oh make we love Margie but Margie is not our God Margie is our sister I took off up to Greens Mill she got me all tore up course I love her and I went up to Greens Mill She said, "Bill, you think I'm going to die?" And I said, "I don't know, but the baby's going to be born anyhow. You're going to have a Joseph." She said, "Is this him?" I said, "I don't know, honey. I can't say, but God said he's going to have Joseph." &gt;&gt; And we're going to have Joseph. I don't care what anything says. We're going to have Joseph. &gt;&gt; Well, the same God that's told me all these revelations told me that he never failed on others and he won't fail on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I went up to me to pray and start there. There stood that line hanging between two trees said go back to your word to the book. I went back to the the Bible and while and laying in my car and when I did the wind it blowed over the word Nathan was sitting at David said go tell my servant David I took him from that sheep coat from feeding those few sheep of his fathers and I made him a great name like the great man not all the the greatest name but just like great man never made him a Billy Graham but I give him a name you know said I done that but said I can't let him build a temple but his son and this said his son's oh my there it was I said Joseph that's time right down the house. went there. The little fella so big she big old boy she couldn't hardly walk going out through the field I run through my arms and I said honey Joseph is coming Joseph is on his road anyone knows it's sincere and you can't let the baby drop that night the baby dropped the water broke everything else next morning 7:00 we're at the hospital the doctor said oh mercy goodness I kissed her goodbye said honey won't be long Joseph be here rub steps you might like that on the operating table a few minutes nurse come down and said Brandham I said yes ma'am said he got a fine 7 lb 3 oz boy. I said, "Joseph, son, welcome." Yes, sir. Wow. Wow. What is it? It wasn't written in the Bible that would happen. But the same God of the Bible that revealed it to Abraham. &gt;&gt; We didn't consider the deadness of her womb, the impossibility to be that way. You don't stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but you give praise to God. No, that's got to happen. I don't care what doctor says. Everything else will have come in all kind of a way, but don't you believe it. It's a lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. True. Faith goes about together with works to create the promise. Let's hurry. Just as Zach says, Rahab the harlot, James said, was justified by works. But why her face? She said, "I hear that God is with you." She didn't want to see how Joshua wore his hair, how he wore his clothes. She said, "I understand that God's with you." That's all was necessary. She may raise just this true vision today. I'm closing just in a moment. True vision from God today. It's a promised word for the day. Say these visions, brother Brand, where do you get that? People stumble. That did not Acts 21:17 said it shall come to pass in the last days. &gt;&gt; That your young man shall see visions, your old man shall dream dreams. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. All right. Now, if that's so, also look at Malachi the 4th chapter and find out if this isn't promised today. How can you have faith in it? The Bible said so. Now, you take Luke 17:30 and read it. Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man, &gt;&gt; just like it was at Sodom." Look at the position of the world today. Sodomites. Look at that. Billy Graham and Or Roberts, them two witnesses down there witnessing to the denominational churches. One to the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian. the other to the Pentecostals. This one, that one, and the other one. But remember, Abraham wasn't in Sodom. He's already called out. &gt;&gt; And there was one stayed and talked to him. And the one stayed and talked to him, showed him a sign with his back turned. He said Sarah was going to have the baby and he had waited on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With his back turned. And he called it God Elohim. Now, that brings to pass today because we have faith. I know this is of God is because this and other scriptures point to this hour. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 says that in the hour of the seventh angel's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he begins to sound forth his message, not in the healing service, but the message that follows the healing service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus went forth and preached. He said he healed the sick and everything. Oh, that young rabbi, that prophet, he's a great fellow. We want him in our church. But one day, he stood up and said, "I, my father, are one." Oh boy. They didn't want him no more then. Oh, except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood. He didn't explain it. &gt;&gt; Said, "Except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." Well, imagine some doctors and nurses said, "This fell's a vampire trying to get a drink his blood." See, they didn't understand it. He know it. But them disciples, they might not been able to explain it, but they sat there and believed it anyhow. Amen. For it was revealed to them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They know it. the scriptures had declared it. It could be asked then to me of this if you might say why do you have faith to believe in these visions when when there's so many false impersonation goes for I'm going to speak a little something strong just for a minute now when so many false impersonations are around remember my brother they are also spoken of that they should be here at the same time &gt;&gt; exactly just as it was in the times of Moses Moses went down to perform the works of God before the people. And there was Jambers and Jambi standing there. &gt;&gt; But who was first to do it? &gt;&gt; Then these others was impersonators. &gt;&gt; Cuz there had to be original first for them to impersonate. If they had been the original, &gt;&gt; we we're not we're not lost. We know where we're at by the scripture, by the revelation of God. That's why you can still stand. Well, this man, he sees visions and so forth. He does this and he run around this man's wife. He believes in the and three gods and all these things that don't stagger to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here's one thing. They can't impersonate the word. &gt;&gt; Notice they can have all these things. They can speak in tongues. They can shout, dance in the spirit, and still be devils. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. But this word measures them up. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. This word comes to them. &gt;&gt; As Moses and Jambas, and remember he said, "As Jambus and Jamus withtood Moses in the last days, these impersonators to rise on the earth again." Did he say it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we got him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, that didn't stagger Moses. When Moses turned around and done a miracle in the name of the Lord, and you stood these impersonators done the same thing, that is time to say, "Well, I guess I better quit and go off the field." He stayed right there &gt;&gt; for what? It was revealed to him. Hallelujah. He knowed by the word of God. He knew the word would finally catch up with him. He knew it' come a time when the word would manifest itself and they couldn't go no further. &gt;&gt; So have I know this all these years. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That the time would come when any miracle, if God sends a real miracle, there's always a change in the whole system. If God sends something into the church and the old system's not changed, he sent it in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a message goes forth and signs and wonders, there is a message follows that. &gt;&gt; When Jesus went forth healing the sick, then come his message. I am the father are one. I am he. &gt;&gt; See, see, they they didn't believe that. They believed his miracles. said, "If you can't believe me, believe those miracles, for they testify to you who I am." &gt;&gt; Oh my glory. &gt;&gt; Who was first? &gt;&gt; Moses. &gt;&gt; Then they impersonated him. But the great truth still remains the same between the right and wrong. They cannot accept the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They cannot accept the message that's unadulterated from the word of God. &gt;&gt; I don't care. Judas could have done all kind of signs and wonders, but when it come to receive the Holy Ghost at the day of Pentecost, he showed his colors. That devil can come right up and impersonate right to the very thing to comes to this word, but he can't take all that word. &gt;&gt; He can bring it all up maybe to one word like Eve did. The devil did Eve, but he can't cross it off because the whole whole thing is a body of Christ word. Now, neither could they could not cannot take the message now. Neither could Jambis and Jambus take Moses' message. They could not do it. Their works of impersonation was made known because they could not be able to follow God's word vindicated by his anointed prophet. &gt;&gt; They could not follow Israel out. &gt;&gt; Why? They were denominational &gt;&gt; Egyptian babies. They could not follow that word. If they did, they had to leave Egypt deny all was good to them and they couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Although they could impersonate the works and do what Moses did, but their folly was made manifest when it come time to leave. Then God really poured out it on them. Same now. &gt;&gt; They might do all kind of false impersonations and things that don't do them, but just magnify the right thing. And any believing child knows that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here you see in plain view then the works of their folly of their impersonation. If your if your works is the true word and vindicated by by your faith, it will manifest and a promise of God in its original written word. Jesus said, "If I do not the works," listen close, "if I do not works." Let me add this to it. that is if I do not the works the scriptures tell you I will do then do that in my age when I come what the Messiah was supposed to do when he comes if the things that I do if God doesn't vindicate that word that he said would happen if my life doesn't make that word live just exactly what it said it would do. Don't miss this. Jesus saying, "You know what the Messiah is supposed to do? That if that word that's written and that it don't manifest itself through me, then I am not he." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the day that I speak of is wrong. What John said about me was untrue. And then if I not that Messiah, if those works that Messiah was supposed to do, he is to be the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me and you haven't had a prophet for hundreds of years. And if them works that I do that God promised, if they aren't manifested in my present life, then I am not he. But if the promised word of this age is vindicated in me, then I am he. &gt;&gt; And the promises come to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Don't see how much plain could be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the promises, oh, then if the promise of that day is manifested in my ministry, said Jesus, then I am he. So if you can't hardly believe who I am, then look at the works is promised for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the works is promised. If them works isn't fulfilled every one of them in me, then don't believe me because I've told you wrong. &gt;&gt; You can't believe me, just look what the Bible said would happen in this day. &gt;&gt; If it isn't happening, then it isn't right. These false things isn't here and all these other things and things are supposed to take place. If it isn't here, then I'm wrong. But if it is, Jesus said, then I'm he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am he that was promised to come. Oh my. Same works that was promised in his day vindicated him to be that Messiah. &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, now brother, if the works of Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse, the promise of Jesus Christ just before his coming that the world would turn back to Sodom and the messengers would go out and the things would be done just exactly. If that isn't taking place, then don't believe me that I've told you the truth. But if it is taking place, then believe that it's him. In that day, the son of man will be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of man will be revealed in a body of flesh. You people, the church, just exactly like it was before the days of Sodom, a called out group away from all of them, &gt;&gt; setting out, leaving the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. All right. &gt;&gt; Than the works that the Holy Spirit is doing today by these visions never failing, promises never failing. All the apostolic signs promise of the Bible of Malachi 4 and all the Revelations 10:7, all of that is being fulfilled and proved by scientific every other way. [Music] &gt;&gt; And if I haven't told you the truth, these things would not happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if I have told you the truth, they bear record that I've told you the truth. &gt;&gt; He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the manifestation of his spirit is catching away abide. &gt;&gt; Let that faith revelation fall into your heart that this is the hour. &gt;&gt; Now, let us pray. Dear God, who was manifested in the flesh in the person of Jesus Christ that raised up from the dead the third day according to the scriptures and ascended on high and sent disciples out to disciples all the world and said these signs shall follow them that believe. God to the Pentecostal church of this day, the restoration of the gifts. May Lord those men, maybe some of them present here, some of them hear in the tape around the world, may they realize that this is the calling out of the bride, not a Pentecostal message. The Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back in the church. But this is a calling forth of the bride. Another message that was to come just before Sodom was to be burned. Let them understand, dear God, faith. I believe this because it's revealed by your spirit through the word of God and has been vindicated and made manifest to the whole world. Certainly, Lord, in a minority, always your groups are that way. But you said, "Fear not, little flock. It's your father's goodwill to give you the kingdom." So, I pray God that man will look away from their intellects, or look away from what they might think was right. And look into the scripture, and it was spoken last night, let the people here think like the queen did in the days of the great destruction of Babylon. She said, "There is a man among you named Daniel was in your father's kingdom. The Pentecostal father was in his kingdom and he is a dissolver of all doubts. And now Lord, let the Holy Spirit that was in the Pentecostal kingdom, the kingdom that was Martin Luther's was John Wesley's and and on through to John Smith, Alexander Camel, and down through the age. He's a dissolver. He dissolved the thoughts and the the people in the days of Luther that man the just should live by faith. The Methodist he dissolved all the doubts that they should they should be sanctified. And in the days of the Pentecost they spoke in tongues give them manifestations of the spirit by divine healing and so forth. It dissolved all the doubts in the Pentecostal's heart. But oh God, they denominated. They went right back out to take man's ideas. Therefore, now when the bride is being called as you promised to hear the scriptures reading it before the world night after night, and we watch it with our eyes, God, may it dissolve all the doubts of the people's heart. May they flee quickly to the open sun to be ripened, to be taken into the garner, and not be left in the stalk to be burned. But may they go to the garner tonight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I hope you caught these two little points. And I thought they're I I thought they they were tremendous of points. He said if God comes to do something and and the same system is there that he brought he brought it to be a change and and he made this statement and I I I want this to get he said faith is a revelation. So if if it's been revealed to you, okay, I mean just think you're sitting here today. You may be here for any number of reasons in any number of condition. And I I I don't care about your condition. You may smoke. You may drink. You may have you may be addicted to video games. You may be addicted to lust. You you may have bitterness in your heart. None of that matters. And there's a reason that it struck me. He said that if it's been revealed to you. He said Jesus came and did the works, right? So they could look at the scripture, see the scriptures, see him and see the works that that was him, right? And they believed that. Now in your day sitting right here this morning, you can look and see, does the Bible say in Malachi 4:5 that God would send forth the spirit of Elijah? No, I don't need to explain that to you. You can read it and listen to it and see it for yourself. That that it would be in the days as it was in the time of Sodom and Gomorrah that the son of man would be revealed. Luke 17:30. In the days of the seventh angel, the mysteries of God would be revealed. You can sit back. You can see the cloud. You saw the seals preached. You look back. You saw you saw the spirit of Ali Elijah come forth. You saw the seventh church age. You saw the the time. You saw those things. If that's been revealed to you, okay, you know that it's true. Not that it's become a lifestyle, not that we formed message churches and now you go to message churches and you're in a message lifestyle. You hang around with message people. Your kids get raised up quote unquote in the message. That doesn't work. But if you can look at it and you can sit there and see this and see that that's the pillar of fire that that man was not God but yet he fulfilled the scriptures that was spoken of him. He did the same sign in him. The same sign that identified the Messiah. That same side was identified to the Gentiles that he turned his back to the audience. He called people out. He did the same thing to identify the son of man. &gt;&gt; Now, if you've got that revelation, okay, that's in your heart. Now, listen to this statement. I just want to read it to you again. He said he he's the dissolver. He dissolved when Luther came. He dissolved all the thoughts of man that were against it. When when Wesley came, he dissolved all the thoughts that they could accept that word. He's a dissolver. Now, if you can catch that and you can say, "I've got the revelation, then if you catch that revelation, catch the revelation that he's a dissolver." Because so, let's say you're battling something in your life, you can look and say, "I see that this is true. I see that that's the truth. I God revealed that to me. I didn't come up with that on my own. He showed me that's the truth. Well, if you've got that revelation, then he can dissolve the thing that you're battling against. We're spending too much time trying to cage things up, &gt;&gt; trying to rope tie it, trying to lock it up in a safe, trying to bring it under subjection, and we find ourselves battling it year after year after year after year. But if you could get what he said in works his faith expressed. He said if you see this being as true that it's absolutely the scripture and God showed you he's a dissolver &gt;&gt; of all doubt a dissolver. I thought when I read that, I said, "Lord, I've been fighting things all my life, trying to bring in some traction, trying to change my lifestyle, trying to do this and trying to do that. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm so tired. &gt;&gt; I'm so defeated. I I I'm almost getting to the place I I'm doubting myself." And then I thought, "Wait a minute. I didn't come up with Malachi 4:5. I didn't sit on my bed one day and decide there had to be this and there had to be that. He revealed it to me. And he wouldn't have revealed it to me if there wasn't a bedding ground &gt;&gt; that it could grow in. &gt;&gt; It didn't instantly change me. I I didn't one day come up believing all the message, understanding the message, but you grow. You grow. And then in season, and I thought, Lord, all you built your church on was this revelation. We've been trying to build it on dresses and and shoes and heels and all those things. And we we've tried to make that the evidence. The evidence of the believer is divine revelation. &gt;&gt; We spend way too much time trying to identify the unbeliever or the makebeliever. It don't matter. If you believe this, not intellectually, but you know that God showed this to you beyond a shadow of a doubt, &gt;&gt; then God is a dissolver. &gt;&gt; He will dissolve the unbelief. because what he is but I can say this it's if you it actually changes the whole system to go we we didn't we don't need to achieve as much as we need stuff dissolved dissolve it Lord &gt;&gt; like sin thrown into the sea of God forgetfulness in the bleach. It totally dissolves. It totally goes back to its elements. Yeah, I struggle with this. But Lord, I believe I believe with all my heart you showed me in Malachi 4:5. I believe I had a bedding ground in there that you're calling me to be a bride. I believe that with all my heart. And Lord, your word said, your prophet said, when he laid that out there, he said that you were a dissolver. I thought, oh God, what a revelation. I've never understood them as being the dissolver. I look at them different now. I look at things different. I don't look at this obstacle of how I've got to move it. I can stand right there and say, "God's gonna dissolve you." &gt;&gt; Because he's a dissolver. I don't have to cage you. I don't have to lock you up. I don't have to put you under chains. &gt;&gt; I don't have to avoid you. &gt;&gt; I got to dissolve her. Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That God then gave me this revelation, promised me he would dissolve all my doubts. You got doubts. Sure, you're human. You got failures. Sure. But what's the one thing you do have? The same thing Abraham had. You had a revelation. &gt;&gt; And if we'd let that revelation work, if we'd say that bedding grounds in me to grow, I'm going to let this revelation grow. I believe it. I believe that this was the calling out of the bride, a new message, &gt;&gt; a new system, not the old system of trying to get everybody to work up their faith. Not an old system of trying to get us to produce the signs and wonders. It's not an old system. That's what he said. My Pentecostal brothers, this is not a Pentecostal message. We're not want to go there. That's not the path forward for the church. The path forward is the pure revelation that this is the unadulterated true word of God. I've had good friends that had big churches, but that revelation never anchored in their heart. And after years and years, they finally couldn't answer certain questions. And because they couldn't answer the questions, they fell away. I don't have to answer any question. It's been revealed to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't figure this out. God showed me &gt;&gt; the son of man, &gt;&gt; deity standing there veiled in a prophet doing the same signs and wonders. It wasn't because of my daddy. It wasn't because of my brother. I personally got a revelation from God. &gt;&gt; And if God gave me that revelation, he knew he would give me that revelation. He knew that revelation had a place to find itself. He knew that revelation would find me. &gt;&gt; And he knew that revelation would dissolve any doubt or anything that kept me from being what I was called to be by divine revelation. And this morning, I would pray that you would get the understanding and the revelation today that God's a dissolver. We have him to be a fixer. We have him to be a changer. And we are always asking him to fix things. We're always asking him to change things. But oh God, be my dissolver. He dissolved all the doubt and all the hearts that accepted Luther's message. He dissolved all the doubts and all the hearts of those that accepted Wesley's message. And then right at the end he calls the Pentecost. He said dissolve all the doubts of those in the Pentecostal kingdom. Dissolve their doubts about Malachi 4:5 about Luke 17:30 about Reverend Oh God, dissolve their doubts. Get rid of all this stuff. But they chose man's way. You know why people go back? Because they don't have a vision to go forward. You can't stay the same. You can't just come day in and day out coming in and out of church and think that you're remaining the same. You're either going forward or backwards. And I realize one thing today in my life, my personal confession to you. If God doesn't dissolve things in front of me, I cannot go forward without the dissolver. He's got to dissolve my fears. He's got to dissolve my doubts. He's got to dissolve my desires. He's got to dissolve things. And then Hebrew half of the god stands up and proclaims. He says he's a dissolver. That's what he's gonna do. He came to dissolve all man's thinking in Pentecost, all human thinking, all conscious ways of the fears and the expectations and our own vision of what's possible. God's here to dissolve. And I say there's lots of dissolving that needs to be done. And I say, God, start with me. Dissolve me. Dissolve everything around me. I cannot do it. I've tried hard, but I'm not a dissolver. He's the dissolver. God bless you if musicians would come. [Applause] The plotting's nice, but it doesn't let you off the hook. You know what I mean? You got a responsibility. Look in your heart. Look in your life. Find those things that need to be dissolved and let God dissolve them for you. Let's stand together as we're going to prepare for dismissal. Let's bow our heads. If you looked at yourself this morning and I thought about the great Joshua when he came up against great Jericho and of the walls falls were so great. There was a believer trapped in those walls and Joshua just started marching around and God dissolved those walls. those walls come tumbling down. Do you have walls in your life that are keeping you from going forward in God? Do you have walls in your life that are keeping you from having peace and joy? Can you just stop a moment and say, "Lord, I believe that this message is calling me to the other side of that wall. I believe that your message is calling me to the other side of my addiction. Lord, I believe this message is calling me to a greater place, the other side of my obstacles, Lord. And I long to be in that place where this barrier no longer stands in front of me. And Lord, I believe with all my heart that you planted the seed in me of Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, the message of this day. Lord, I believe that you sought me out and you found me and you gave me Isab that I could see it that there was a bedding ground that this message could grow, Father. And I let it grow as much as I could. But Father, there's roadblocks and there's mountains and there's trees. There's things that are in my path that been there for a long time that I've been trying to overcome. And Lord, I realize that it's the faith and the revelation that you gave me that I could just stand and hold fast to that with all of my heart. And the mountains and the roadblocks and the bridges and everything that hinderth me, Lord, it'll be dissolved. And Lord, you're a dissolver. You said and revealed to me that you're a dissolver and that these things can slowly dissolve in my life and that the path forward will be open to me. And Lord, I ask that there be any here this morning that feels there's things that are keeping them from being what they know in their heart that they want to be. Not in their minds what they think they should be, but in their heart of what they really want to be. Have that love of God spread about in their heart. not being judgmental, being kind with every man, looking upon everybody better than theirel, just have the love of God in their heart and have faith, Lord, and they know there's a place that they want to be, that they feel that you're calling them to, and they'd like to lift their hand and say, "Lord, dissolve anything in between me and my heart's desire. You promised you would give me my heart's desire, Lord. And my flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. And these two are contrary one to another. But Father, I ask now that you would start the dissolving process in my life, however you choose to do it. Father, I believe that the path will be clear and the way will be straight. And even though there's few be that find it, Lord, I desire to be one of the ones that walks with you in your presence. And Father, may my works identify the union. Lord, may I stand steadfast just as our prophet stood steadfast believing the promise of his son. May I stand steadfast believing the promise of your son in my life this morning. I ask you to grant it to these people, Father, who have been so attentive this morning and have endured. Father, may they take something with them today that is so personal to their own life that they can rest knowing that if you before them, who can be against them? If they have the dissolver in their heart by divine revelation that there's nothing can stand in the face of God's elect. And I just pray now, Father, that our faith would rise even above the laying on of hands, Father, into the steadfastness of divine revelation. I ask it this morning in Jesus precious and holy name we pray. Amen. God bless you this morning. We'll be dismissed. It's late. I know some of you have to travel. Some of you have to eat. And so God bless you so much. This is a wonderful message. Works as faith expressed. If you get a chance to read it, try to identify yourself in God's word. Amen.
