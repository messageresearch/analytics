may the Lord bless you it's like a I'm gonna give like a little testimony I'm G to make it like so short I'll try to be short um it's about um everything started like two and a half years ago when I first came to with you guys to be among you and uh so when I came here you know the message became like something like so different than the way that I used to see the message and um that impacted my life and probably my my wife can say the same thing and my kids my family and um so we went to Mexico after we we moved with you guys and um at the same time my mother-in-law went through through such a rough times and um so we went and visit him and my when we were driving back my my wife had a you know she was like feeling like so bad about the family you know her two sisters and uh my mother-in-law and she had a burden on her heart and um so we came back and she wasn't feeling good you know I think she had a some sickness that the Lord healed her uh through prayer but I remember one time she came to the altar to get pray for and uh she came exactly to be prayed for for the the sickness that she had right but at the same time she had that burden on on her heart about the family so whenever that she came by you know our our pastor the first thing that that he tell her is like you don't have to worry about your family you know the Lord already opened a door for them so take that out of your mind you know just keep praying for them and you don't have to worry about him you know the Lord already opened a a door for them away and uh so we went that happened like in the spring and then we we went back in summer and um the Lord you know like he moving a how you say miraculous way uh over there and uh I remember I was uh we were having fellowship with my with my sister-in-law and um and one thing that I want to mention she was addicted to smoke since she was since she was 12 and then now she's like 33 and uh that night I remember you know the Lord moving a super a supernatural way or natural way and uh she got delivered out of that condition and uh you're not going to believe uh this but you know she used to to do her eyelashes and you know her her her was she had a how you say c c her or something like that you know where CH cut the her and uh she used to wear shorts like this short over here and and uh since that night since that night without uh you know like made any special prayer or anything like that you know the Lord changed her at that night and uh you know I remember our pastor he started preaching like you know oh he preached I think the uh end of the year he preached with no books uh no Bible and no tapes and uh you know that really impacted my life and uh so when we when I was listening to our pastor about all the the things that we was been preaching and everything that really impacted my life and I'm like okay you know like I'm not going to try to convince anybody you know to come to the message or to believe in the Lord Jesus or whatever you know Lord just be you through through us and uh so the the Lord put that burden in my heart after that to come back and um and Ministry to them so I came back and I talked to our pastor and brother Cosman and uh I told Brother Cosman you know and I really appreciate and I'm doing this because he's over here uh because I don't want to do it after he's not in here you know and I told Brother Cosman like the third time that we went over there I told him hey I think we have to make a report to the church and he's like no you have to do it because this is the Lord doing through you so you have to do it yourself and I'm like no you know all this is new to me so I can't you know like it's like I'm so shy and I I can do this you have to help me and then we let time pass by and we never done it but I think it the Lord has uh he the time for everything right so we went me and brother Cosman and then uh he started preaching and everything and so there is one family that came to the Lord that's my sister-in-law and my her husband and then they had three uh uh three daughters one is like eight 19 18 and 15 and then whenever they came to the message they're like you know what like okay it's okay for you to change your lives and whatever but we don't want nothing to do with the Lord uh we don't want nothing to do with that stuff for right now I mean probably we'll change by later so the Lord is like so marvelous that uh like four months ago or five months ago they one of them longer longer than that one of them came to the church to the to the church and uh since then you know the three little girls and and them are in the message now and they don't stand for nothing else but the message and one one other thing that I want to mention my pastor I talk to him about it and then he's like hey you know what don't don't don't put anything that you have in your mind you know like just teach him teach him the message and the Lord will do the rest don't put anything any of your thoughts and and whenever you're talking to them so the Lord did uh you want to help me I don't know if you can you put the pictures so they can see brother it's like a little report so you know that the what the Lord did in Mexico that's uh uh Juanita and um the husband it's uh Tony and my sister-in-law B by the side of my wife and my brother-in-law and the by the by the end and um so they they came they start they started coming to church uh two weeks ago they were hard Harding their hearts but finally they came to the to the message uh with the other testimony about the other family this is one family and the other one is another family can you put the other one brother and then uh brother Tommy and Brother Joseph Gordon the Lord put on their hearts to to come and testify about what the the Lord did on their lives and he was uh such a good time that we had and then they Rejoice on the testimony that they share over there so that's uh my the one that is by my wife that's my sister-in-law the one that that used to be smoking since she was 12 and the Lord changed her completely and that's my the husband by the end that's Tabo and uh Mario so can you help me brother come and say come and say something I could like so nervous come here I mean he knows more right I'm I'm sweating I I figured I can get away from having to be up here yeah so I'm doing all this you know as a recognition or respect for brother Cosman and how the Lord uses him um and I really appreciate appreciate him and I'm I'm going to miss him a lot you know I just want to thank thank him and uh sister hly and the family CU When I first came to the church they really opened their hearts not only him but you know brother Andrew brother uh Chris a lot of you guys and I really appreciate you but I'm doing all this as a respect for you what the Lord has done in your life and your testimony you know for everything that the Lord has done so you want to say something you want to share something yeah you know um Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever uh we'll try to be really short but you know brother Jose had a burden upon his heart to bring this message to his own family and this message you know just like he was expressing and he was told by our pastor it's not a Doctrine it's not something that you just try to go teach and just create disciples by just trying to go give them a letter and then try to train them in certain ways to live according to this message but it's actually a life that is lived before them and and they've already been a testimony in Mexico before we even arrived there because every time they would go they would give books and they would stand and and share testimonies and they would be able to sit around the table and talk about the goodness of God and God was already moving upon their hearts so you know when we started joining the burden with brother Jose we just went there to encourage the family and I can say this Jesus Christ can pres make his presence in a small little room if you're just sincere and you're you're ready to receive him and uh we've had some wonderful times the Lord really has uh blessed brother Jose to continue to be there for him and and um you know even um the drives we did a few drives down there you know it's not easy to drive 10 hours to Mexico and take things and you can go through the pictures um but you know this is this was ao's place this is the brother-in-law of brother Jose and this is where we gathered and just fellowshipped really that's all we did we just fellowshipped and talked about the word and we would just enjoy one another's Fellowship you know this world is not a world where they love anymore you know when you sit around the table these days with worldly people they don't want to talk about Jesus Christ anymore they talk about rumors of wars and wars and all these things and all the fears that are in the world and all these other things and what it does it shakes the foundation and all of a sudden now it's just bringing fear within the people when when you stand around talking about Jesus Christ it does something to the believer and it gives him hope it gives him faith knowing that whatever may come Jesus Christ will be there for us amen because that's the life that we live in so um so that's uh Tabo and uh Sarah my sister-in-law and the uh uh one of their two little girls you know the one that is by my sister-in-law and the other one with the glasses and my mother-in-law so the Lord is sing you know every every member of the body of Christ you know just like brother kman was saying you just have to be yourself and and be available for the Lord to use you you know like you don't you don't have to wait in your time is on his time that's right and uh I think that's yeah I think that's all I wanted to mention and uh just want to thank you all for all your All Your Love uh and I want to sing this song it's called in Spanish uh what a miracle is to have a family in Christ uh because that's what we are I think brother uh David said it in the morning you know when when we when he was uh presenting I don't know how you said uh little William that no matter how small or how how little or how big you are we're all family right I just want to end up with this song and I just want to appreciate brother Cosman and his ministry and the ministry of our pastor cuz it's been a blessing for me and my family [Music] realia [Music] [Music] inia [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen we still need to find that last one so wherever they are I believe that's it could be through the family wherever they are amen we just want to be able to go and find them certainly appreciate amen that's how God moves it's from Faith to faith it will put something in your heart and you'll go and testify about what God has done in your life and now it will'll move from him into the other person amen but a

know [Music] for in the one [Music] [Applause] amen bless the Lord amen and some people sing and some just make noise and you know which category I am let's all stand and sing as invite let's sing Jesus Jesus there's something about that name as you brother George amen oh Jesus Jesus Jesus oh there's just something about th name oh Master save oh [Music] Jes Jesus Jesus [Music] J [Music] heav King and kingdoms will all pass away but there's something [Music] amen let's pray father we are told all things that we do we do in that name because there's a life and there's a person that stands behind that name who said you ask anything of my father in my name and he will grant it Lord we're not worthy to speak your name it's a name above all names and we have not words in our vocabulary to give you the honor and the praise that that you deserve but we thank you for it and we thank you for the power that that name has and the hope that it gives us and we call upon it one more time this evening we call upon you Lord in your wonderful name to be with us and we ask these things in that name the name of our Lord and savior the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you for a moment may be seated I just want to um just take a moment we have a a special need this evening that I I was praying in the back about what time to address it but I just feel this is the time to handle it you know I I I like what Billy said he said you know some people can sing and some people make noise but if your heart's sincere behind what you sing that's music to God's ear you can sing like an opera singer but if there's nothing there and no experience or no identity with the words um it doesn't matter but when the spirit in the heart it's music that's true music of worship not in the measure of men but I I you know cuz I would hope when I sing it's music to the Lord it might be noise to you but it's music to him praise God so we're thankful for that you know faith is an amazing thing amen it can do all things it can move mountains it can change time but faith has a place that it has to rest has to have a place to Anchor it's got to have something to hold on to you might be rushing down the river in a flood and you know we hear the stories all time people survived night and day they hung on on to a branch or they hung on to a rope or they hung on to something and and that's what faith does faith gives you that something to hang on to and tonight we have a need um we want to pray for a baby and a little baby can't have faith but our messenger told us he said you have to have faith for that child you have to have faith for that child which means that God will honor your faith you may not be a part of the situation or you not may not be a part of the struggle or you might not feel the pain and the heartache of this the situation itself but your faith can make a difference if a bad attitude could change a a service whether someone gets healed or not then maybe the right attitude could do the same thing you know what I mean it could it could have the same effect and so I want to call upon your faith tonight because a friend of mine i' I've known her for a long time you know seven and she's uh sister Kendall's daughter and her husband are here and they have a baby together and and they diagnosed that baby with a bad heart and I know doctors always try to prepare us for the worst but God's word prepares us for the possible amen yes sir and and it's got the it it's like our sister saying it it changes things am makes things different and if God doesn't undertake for this child they want to just take it and put it on life support and let it finish its days and that's where faith comes in amen that's where the believer comes in you know you don't want to be a believer that sits back and just hopes and waits for something to transpire that's not faith faith is people who are willing to stand up and confess God's word yes they're able to say there and says this is what I believe the result will be of my prayer because if you don't testify of it God can do nothing for you that you do not confess and so I wanted to I'm going to ask them to come up and and we're going to pray for this baby but you know our whole reason to believe is based on God's word and I say God's word I don't mean a written bible I mean the word that he gave us himself I will do this by my Stripes you are healed you know and Peter said it this way he says by these exceedingly great and precious promises we are partakers of divine nature we can hang on to faith and we're not hanging on to our faith we're hanging on to what he said we believe what he said amen that's what our faith is it's not in ourselves it's not in our feelings our faith is in what that he said he said so that settles it if he I I like our messenger said if God told me George Washington was going to raise from the dead and he said it I would tell the world to be there because it's based on what he said well not only do we know what he said but we have a history and a record of him keeping this word so our faith is built on these promises faith is not a test to you can you believe this or can you believe that that's not faith faith is something that you hear the word and you know it's true and it's so true to your heart that you're willing to make your decisions based upon it that's this word that brother George has been preaching to us about not a movement not what's going on but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and so our faith is built on this in Hebrews 11 and one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen if we can believe his word I know that that word will perform that which I haven't seen I don't have to wait to see it to believe it I believe what he said that's what my faith is and it's like a a man you know when a man's in his calling that calling produces fruit if a man's out of his calling no matter how hard he works it won't but we're called to lay our hands on the S and they shall recover we are commissioned to go into the world and preach the gospel and that these signs shall follow them that believe the prophet of God says that's the evidence of the church amen when it's not a doctrinal belief but that word is made real in the lives of the people and that they see the fruits of their prayer because they believe that God hears their prayer l lukewarm is Wai and see you know this this is the proof of the Ice Cube It's not the singing and the shouting it's the signs that follow it also says in Hebrews 138 I know you know these scriptures but they mean so much to you in an hour in a time like this Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he said suffer the little ones to come unto me come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest those are the things that he said go into the world Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover do you believe he said that are you a believer do you believe that will work for you in your prayer not me not a preacher but you the believer the two or three of us that are gathered together here it also says in Peter the 5th chapter and the seventh 1 Peter 5 and 7 it says casting all your cares upon Him for he carth for you do you believe God cares for this little baby you know where that heart condition comes from it comes from the devil and you might make the difference might be a little sister praying in a balcony it might be one of you teenagers that's heart's moved might be a mother that has a little baby that would reach up and Touch the Hem of His Garment they're not quote unquote message Believers as we might feel but God doesn't judge that he judges the faithful the little baby has no choice King David once said I was cast upon you Lord for my mother's womb here I am you put me here what can I do and here's this little baby it's got one choice in fact it doesn't have a choice either faith will save it or it will die I hate to be so Stark and I would like to be kinder but that's the truth of the matter and I think we take things way too lightly but the prophet of God said there's healing in communion and we've come tonight to take communion so I believe the faithful are here the others might not feel its importance but you're assembled here to take communion and along with that communion comes healing so I'm going to ask seven and your husband if you'd bring your baby [Music] I forgotten your name brother George would you come pray with me would you turn around show your baby what your name Ezra Ezra his life might lie in your hands we're going to place him in the hands of our Lord and savior would you join in us in prayer tell the people he he is not gaining weight um he's losing weight and he won't keep anything down really um and he's not building muscle to be able to sit up like a seven-month-old should or um he won't stay awake for longer than an hour at a time so they're running a few test on him to see what's going on but they've kind of given us the worst diagnosis um so yeah let us pray our gracious loving father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we rebuke the sick that has struck this child Giver of Life Giver of Hope purchaser of our healing and our Salvation we call upon you in the wonderful name that we sang of the name of Jesus father we believe that you spoke it we believe that your word is true and we claim this healing of this child tonight father that through this child this family might come back to the Lord that others could look at their lives and see that you are still the same yesterday today and forever and that your light and your gospel has never changed that what you did yesterday you will do today and where else could we go you alone have the words of life and the words of life that you spoke were by his stripes we are healed and father we accept that word as the foundation of our faith and we believe for this child in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you it's good to be back in the house of the Lord tonight and it is a special night of [Music] communion and we're not going to speak long but we hope to speak something that will be a blessing to everyone and um you know throughout the Book of Acts as we went through it carefully they were glad to have the the the Miracles just don't speak in that name put that name aside stick with the traditions of the fathers because for thousands of years we've quoted our prophet and blah blah blah and they had problems because this new new thing was coming but this was only the manifestation of the promises that they had memorized all those years and so in our study we found many many truths and the fact is that uh every Revival produces twins it's produced twins in our time I have very dear friends that I walked with that I have communion with etc etc and then one day the light went out and they went another way scripture says if you've been here and you partook and you've enjoyed and you walk away it's a one-way street I'm not going after him that's not God's will this is all about equal opportunity you had your choice and so you know most of the Believers back in the book of Acts there in chapter 6 and 7 they loved brother Steven brother Steven was in a he was an um an evangelist and many miracles that happened but there were certain people that rose up to dispute to argue with the man of God who in their right mind would want to you know argue with the man of God but they do they do today and they did back there and so when they saw that they couldn't out argue him that they says here uh they were not able to resist the wisdom of the spirit which he spake what' they do then they did just like they do today money under to their table didn't start in Mexico it didn't start in Washington started clear back here in the Bible they suborned they they put money under the table and said for these people you know if they get the money then I want you to go say we've heard this man speak Blasphemous words against Moses against God a bunch of nonsense stuff that wasn't true but they got money so they're doing it you know and so um when they when they couldn't when they see that this didn't work they bribed some other people so back based on these allegations that these people were saying the the religious police grabbed Steven must be some truth you know where there's smoke there's fire so they grabbed him and they took him in and there was confusing accusations you know uh repeating misquotations yeah we've got in the ministry we've got to be very careful how we present things because people go out here yeah I heard him say no you didn't no you lied we speak truth amen so the repeating misquotations little pieces of the message in the wrong order you know out of Harmony and so they had problems but you know God's man was confident he knew that God had called him just like Brother David knows that God called him here the people that left well have a nice day we're having Church you know and so in in chapter 6 and verse 13 they set up the false Witnesses and uh we've heard him say these bad things they're in front of a council they're in front of very important people and all in the council looking at stepen they saw his face as it was the face of an angel that should have been the end of the argument right there if this man looks like an angel then something's not right these accusations can't be true so the main man he says um uh sir are are these things true well when you give the man of God a microphone it's going to go on for a while you know and from there he launched that into the deep water and um he um gave him a very good history Lesson by Revelation in chapter 7: 51 it comes down to the fact that um and you stiff neck numb circumstan and heart and ears you'd always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye they're they're just it's in their blood that's what they're going to do regardless you see which of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted and so forth and it goes on down here and um and when they heard these things so here's the man of God speaking nothing but Truth by Revelation no Bible no nothing just speaking when they heard these things they were cut to the heart they nasted their teeth we're going to get this guy being filled with the Holy Ghost he looked up steadfastly into heaven and he saw the glory of God he saw Jesus at the right hand of God and he said behold I see the heavens opened now this is a live you know Vision he's telling them about I see the heavens open the Son of God standing there and they cried with a loud voice and stopped their ears and they ran upon him in one Accord and they threw him out of the city and out there they stoned him and they took their coats off and their backpacks and they laid it down at this man's feet now you watch this stuff we're going to go Stone this man who do you think this little guy was over here it's about a 18yar old man named Saul to be a good Pharisee you got to go through training from 14 to 40 so he's in training he's just watching the stuff he's not throwing any rocks and so they stoned him and he's calling come on God he said Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and he fell asleep the death of the first martyr this didn't come to us on a silver platter it came through much suffering okay so this is the first mention we have of Saul and he um he was a a bad boy we could say because he was persecuting the Lord's elect this man was so ingrained with with his prophet's words Moses said now they jumped over a few things but Moses said Moses said and so when Steven is killed well then the people hey this is getting pretty serious here so it took this persecution of the Lord's people um for them to leave Jerusalem we better get out of here we might be next you know but God had a plan because over here in acts: 18 he said and you'll be my Witnesses here in Jerusalem in Samaria and Judea and to the end of the Earth Marco Polo hadn't been born yet they didn't know the Earth was around and there was people over there their world was very small they knew where Spain was and Rome they'd heard about India stuff coming over but they didn't know how it was going to happen they didn't have SUVs they didn't have planes they didn't have boats had nothing you know had boats but but how's it going to happen well people start leaving they start taking the gospel where they're going so this Pharisees Saul was one of the main troublemakers standing for the traditions of the fathers this is what we have for thousands of years and we're not going to put up with anybody coming in here saying there's something better this is it now they had memorized a large portion of their Bible but they couldn't visualize the manifestation so I don't have any time for this say what he said well let's let's let's see what it manifests into you know if you tell me that KFC is good food but I see you ding your your skeleton well then you're not a very good advertisement you know so let's see the evidence you know so um here he is bringing persecution on the early church and in Saul's own words he says I was bringing Havoc I was bringing problems to the to the early church Havoc means trouble confusion God is not the author of confusion so the death at the death of Judas scariot the church leaders that we got a vacancy here let's uh let's see let's let's vote on this and let's see and pray well they chose a man on the front row that paid ties good man yeah that'd be a good replacement that wasn't God's choice no you know and so um uh this this man that was arresting people taking them to court miss you know with mis uh quotations and things seeing people die he was a Pharisee and train but it was God's choice brother brand said if it was up to us Americans we' have never pick Saul not in a million years bad boy that he was killed grandma and all those things you know but God's choosing is a little short hook-nosed sarcastic high-tempered Jew whoa it doesn't sound good does it no and uh he's the one's dragging converts into into court and watching them be put to death people just like you and they what what the reason was because they love the Lord Jesus they gave their life for Jesus you see just like I said all through the book of Acts it wasn't a matter of whether the people were healed or not well y's healed man you know laid on the C there for 38 years and now he's jumping up just don't mention the name Jesus even the enemy knows where the power is and today we have people that brother Bram said brother Braham said okay well we got we got places in the Bible where where this um uh this uh people they were casting out demons and they were doing things and they said yeah in the name of the of the god that Paul preaches and so the demon spoke back to him well now wait a minute I know Jesus I know Paul or who you guys we don't want to be over there do we we want to be with the right side of things so anyway Paul is you know he he's Saul was his you know his Jewish name Paul is his Roman name and he's he's getting some influence here he's he's he's a bad boy so far but you see then he's converted and God knows what he's doing so we're going to jump over a few things here because not going to preach the whole part of the U book of Acts but you see when you don't understand how God's going to do something that looks impossible oh Lord why why that's not your position to ask why your position yes Lord I will be done we'll walk quietly so always remember the sign that of Psalms 46 uh 10 be still I'm God got to figure it out don't need your opinions you all got chicken brains relax so God doesn't um need our opinion he only needs our obedience that's all he wants just obey we got such a simple message only believe don't get any simpler than that amen so here's young Saul zealous government agent looking for those that are not complying just like the people that come around here once in a while check the lights are too bright or you know Park cars are Park in the wrong place that's their job see who's not complying with the rules you know that was S no guard for human rights no profiling no problem and if you even looked at you were part of the way but one day he's on his road to Damascus from Jerusalem that's 130 Mi Northeast and so it's probably 4 day Journey who knows they're on Horseback and he's going along with his helpers got his you know government issued uniform on and um if he found anybody that closely resembled as part of the way like sisters dressed right or men with a proper haircut anybody that looked like a Christian he didn't stop and ask questions and you know all your history you look like it you're going with me so he's on his way to Damascus because he had already begged the high priest give me orders I got to go get these people he didn't wait for the mail to come he went and begged for him so he's got these arrest warrants and he tells his story through the book of Acts but we put it all together here it was a bright hot sunny day like today but about 120° and he's going along on his horse they're Mo moving along they're getting close to Damascus and U it's about noon and all of a sudden there's a much brighter light appeared now the Noonday Sun's about as bright as it gets much brighter light appeared Shone all around them and knocked everybody off their horses okay such a bright light they're very confused they're fear less Commander the Pharisee in charge of the anti-christian campaign is now faed down in the dirt oh this doesn't look too good and uh his uniform is all dirty and it looks like he's talking to himself we really got a problem they all Saw The Light they all fell off their horses and they all heard a sound but only Saul heard the voice in the Hebrew tongue thank you God speaks to you in language that you can understand that's why I gave you brother Dave for for pastor language you can understand and so um he said the voice said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me now Saul hadn't been persecuted anybody in particular just anybody that looked like a Christian okay because they acted like Christians and he said well Lord who are you and so what's this all this bright light and everything I am Jesus of Nazareth the one that you have been persecuting along with all my people and immediately what do you think he flashed in his mind the death of Steven back there because when that happened he's a young man over there watching the stuff but he's watching that young man die and he falls on his knees and he goes down and if you haven't seen the movie that Hollywood put out a few years ago Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ they stick right with the scriptures wonderful so anyway he remembered the Steven's death and immediately he's totally disarmed it's the end of the road I'm faced down in the dirt bright light hear this voice from heaven and he had to yield completely amen and so he um you know had given up he couldn't go any F farther and so he's um now what do you want me to do uh okay so I I see that you're you've got me arise and go into d Mascus and that's a whole other story we're not going to go into it but you know the fact is that he preached for many years Paul traveled uh about 10,000 miles in 30 years and he um he had a lot of converts he had a lot of you know uh Ministry going on but in the in the chapter um 20 I believe it is uh he's already been to several places remember he didn't have a white stallion didn't have an SUV didn't have a bicycle he walked maybe on a horse sometimes but now um he's over in the city of traz chapter 20 and the early churches were specifically warned against submitting themselves to the bondage of any legalistic Obedience of Sabbath days in other words that's the way the Jews did it now remember that's all they had Jesus said over in I think Matthew 10 go only to the house of Israel because the scripture says he came to his own his own received him not so they've been all the early people were Jews Jewish Believers but now that the gospel has come they didn't want to continue in those same Traditions they wanted something a little different okay and so these early churches voluntarily chose the first day of the week as an appropriate time for fellowship and worship ship in remembrance of the day our Lord arose that's what we call Resurrection Sunday you know so that's recorded in all the Gospels it was a new day new people new creation and the observance of the first day of the week is in many of the early writings even ireneus in the second Church age so here's Paul having communion service with the Saints and traz in chapter 20 of Acts and um uh if you read the story carefully it looks like they're in a bit of a hurry and we don't know what time they started church but the fact is that he's leaving the next day he's got a lot to say he's God's messenger of the hour the very eager disciples they wanted to hear everything he had to tell them and um and at midnight he's still preaching so we're not going to go that far but just warning you we do have scripture so in verse 8 of chapter 20 we have the fact that and there were many lights in the sheer chamber I love the book of Acts got all the details they didn't have these kind of Lights okay we didn't have these kind of Lights a few years ago but they didn't have lights they had torches on the wall fire that produces heat it's midnight people are getting tired and so says here in the upper chamber and they sat in the window now they're on the third floor and there's no screens there's no glass there's just open windows and there's a man sitting in the window and he fell asleep in church imagine that y'all didn't invent that either did you hey I have fallen asleep in church I was in Trinidad where it's 90° every day we had early you know Sunday morning immediately we go to this big Feast oh we got to go we got to go because there's another church over there three about a thousand people got to go well here I'm sitting on the platform 95° out and I just filled up I fell asleep just human so he fell asleep as Paul was long preaching went to sleep and he fell out of the third floor and he's dead on the pavement yeah it happened and Paul went down fell upon Him braced him trouble not no he's okay life is in him and when he therefore was come up again so they came back up the third floor and they had communion even until the sun came up and then he left all through the the Bible all through the New Testament through the book of Acts we have they had communion in in the chapter two I think it is they met every day because Jesus has just told them do this in remembrance of me we have no scripture to uh remember his birth oh but America has made a big deal out of it we we going to De grandkids got to have presents and a lot of times they don't wait till Christmas anyway scripture commands us to remember the Lord's death and we have songs we have scripture we have prophets preaching and where there's no mention of the Cross where there's no mention of the blood you got a dead church we have to keep that before the people that's why this cross is up here that long part that's your prayer life that's your responsibility if you keep your prayer life straight God will take care of the horizontal and so that's why it's important to stay balanced and so those are the few words I wanted to share with you from the book of Acts to let you know that God is real and we're not going to preach long because I know some people are tired we just want to make it real to you let you know that God still is on the throne it's still important to to observe the um Lord's Supper because to be a Christian okay first there's I'm a sinner so you repent and you're baptized okay now you you're looking more like a Believer but then you got to be here with your presence you got to show up can't you send in your tithe money well you got to be here and you got to take communion that constitutes a member of the church all others well thank you very much but uh you know you're missing a little bit something so we want to proceed into the communion service we're going to uh stand together and read from the book of First Corinthians all the brothers bring out the elements but you see um Paul wasn't present at the Lord's Supper in John 13 he received it by Revelation so therefore our Prophet says lay everything aside seek Revelation that's more important than anything so in 1 Corinthians 11:23 I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you in other words I brought you the Revelation that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED said saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me in other words these these are things we do remembering his death until he comes for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself that's that's why we're here to examine okay Lord is there anything lacking is there anybody I spoke evil to examine yourself you see um and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep they've died for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another If any man hungry let him eat at home in other words don't come here hungry and and you know this isn't sandwich time no and brother brandom had a a tradition of his own that after the communion service you don't stand around LLY gag and talk about baseball you have the communion service the foot washing you get in your car go home if the children need a little something just he he wouldn't eat after that not till midnight and a lot of times he was leaving town but um you have food at home that she come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so those are the instructions set for forth by Paul and are the brothers bringing no so if you come up we'll pray over the elements Bread's already been baked and and broken we're going to pray over the elements Heavenly Father we thank you for this occasion we can be here together we thank you Lord for faithful followers faithful deacons faithful Ministry Lord we therefore now bless this bread that it might be encouragement and strength and healing to the people's body we've come in faith believing Lord likewise we have the the wine that's been prepared we pray that you would bless it may this be a blessed occasion there's healing in the cup help us now we ask in Jesus name amen amen okay one other thing is they're getting ready bringing the people up um in Jeffersonville it's a small Church 400 maybe squeezed into a smaller area and so one of the Believers one of the members had a neighbor the neighbor was the Church of Christ they have a whole different program so the believer said to the Church of Christman his neighbor hey come on church with me kept asking him to come well finally the brother said fine I'll go with you tonight well it was communion night oh and see we have closed communion where it's only us or open communion if you say you're a Believer you can partake so he comes up well by the time he gets up here to take his communion brother Neville says to brother brandham uh brother brandham we're out of wine well that's embarrassing so brother brand says we'll just pray so the Church of Christ man he knew the scripture said Watch and Pray so he's you know he's watching while they're praying and his testimony was that while brother ran and prayed the little cups filled with wine from nothing God is still God so God bless you come forward may be seated on [Music] [Music] you with me [Music] l [Music] for [Music] I [Music] you [Music] h [Music] h [Music] he B [Music] can you put the words on the [Music]

at your feet sweet Spirit sweet more over my soul amen reading now from John Chapter 13 as it's recorded here maybe stand please verse two and supper being ended so after the supper the devil having now put into the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rised from supper laid aside His Garment took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet he had never done this before apparently and to wipe them with the towel where worth He was GED and he came to Simon Peter you know Simon had a bit of a mental problem he talked at the wrong time he came to Simon Peter Simon already saw what he was doing and uh Peter said to him Lord you you're washing my feet and Jesus said what I do now you don't understand but you will know soon after and Peter said to him you'll never wash my feet Jesus answer answered if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me so then Simon he just couldn't find balance you know he said well Lord then not miss my feet but give me a bath wash everything and Jesus said he that is washed needeth not only to save his wash his feet but is clean every quit and you're clean but not all because he knew that you know he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments would sit down again he said unto them do you know what I've done you all call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet it's right there in Red Letters what I have to wonder for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you verily verily I say Toto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them
