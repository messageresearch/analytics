[21:30] time.
[22:21] When life lets [singing and music] you
[22:23] down and you feel more broken than
[22:27] whole.
[22:32] When the wounds go deeper than
[22:35] [singing and music] words
[22:37] and you can't tell a soul.
[22:42] [music]
[22:43] I may [singing] not know what you're
[22:46] going through.
[22:48] May not can make that high
[22:50] [singing and music] mountain move. But
[22:53] one thing I found that I really want you
[22:58] to know,
[23:02] if it matters to [singing] you,
[23:06] it matters to the master.
[23:12] He wants to share the burdens [singing]
[23:16] you bear.
[23:18] Whisper [music] peace when your world
[23:21] gets shattered. [singing]
[23:23] If it's your greatest joy or your
[23:26] deepest pain or you're [singing] really
[23:29] needing an answer,
[23:32] if [music] it matters to you,
[23:37] it matters [singing] to the master.
[23:44] Friend, do you [singing] think the maker
[23:47] and giver of life
[23:53] is far [singing] too busy [music]
[23:55] to care about your trouble strife?
[24:02] [music]
[24:03] He sees a sparrow that falls to the
[24:06] ground and he hears [singing and music]
[24:08] the tears that don't make a sound. And
[24:12] only you [singing and music] knew how
[24:15] precious you are in a sight.
[24:19] [music]
[24:20] If [singing] it matters to you,
[24:25] it matters [music] to the master.
[24:30] He wants to share the burdens
[24:33] [singing and music] you bear.
[24:36] Whisper peace when your world gets
[24:39] [singing] shattered. If it's your
[24:42] greatest [music] joy or your deepest
[24:44] pain or [singing] you're really needing
[24:48] an answer,
[24:50] [music] if it [singing] matters to you,
[24:54] it matters to the master.
[24:58] [singing and music]
[25:00] If it's your greatest joy or your
[25:04] deepest pain or you're [singing] really
[25:07] needing an answer,
[25:10] if [music] it matters to you,
[25:14] it doesn't only matter to [singing] you.
[25:20] If it matters to you,
[25:25] matters [singing] to the master.
[25:32] [applause and music]
[25:37] [applause]
[25:50] Too glad whatever concerns you concerns
[25:54] him.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like how our pastor put it last
[25:58] Sunday. He told Samuel, he said, "If
[26:00] they rejected you, they rejected me."
[26:03] Amen. Why? Because you are the very
[26:05] representative of who he is, of
[26:08] everything that he is. Amen. Amen. Just

[26:32] ring that was lost." Amen. Praise the
[26:35] Lord.
[26:39] Amen. He's the restorer of all that we

[27:01] that God has been giving me through the
[27:04] love of my brothers and sisters in Jesus
[27:06] Christ. Divine love it's says divine

[27:13] May God richly bless you. Amen. Amen. I
[27:17] tell you [music]
[27:18] uh words can heal [clears throat] God.
[27:21] You could just speak the word and it
[27:23] provides healing to the soul. [music] I
[27:25] I'll tell you this. There's nothing that
[27:27] can really heal the spirit like the word
[27:30] of God. Amen. The flesh, you could go to
[27:32] the doctor, but even the spirit when he
[27:34] gets wounded, the word brings healing to
[27:37] our souls and our bodies. Amen. Brother
[27:39] John the Baptist write this. It says,
[27:41] "I'm so uh grateful to our [music] Lord
[27:44] Jesus Christ for answering to my
[27:46] request." It said that regarding uh the
[27:49] lost papers for my car uh I left in
[27:52] Jobec. He said after your prayers the
[27:55] saints of Christian life tabernacle four
[27:57] months ago uh we finally found the the
[28:00] and recovered [music] them on Monday
[28:02] evening. Amen. Amen. So all the
[28:05] paperwork and everything has been
[28:07] recovered and we thank the Lord for
[28:08] that. Amen. Sister Cindy writes, "We
[28:11] want to thank the Lord for a wonderful
[28:13] blessing uh in uh that uh my sister Lexi
[28:18] uh is with us today and and everybody
[28:20] around her. Uh she's celebrating another

[28:52] you know just couldn't finish a [music]
[28:54] sentence so he wasn't feeling well this
[28:56] morning. We just want to lift our pastor
[28:57] up in prayer this morning. Amen. I
[29:00] believe just our prayers can certainly

[29:20] according to the promises and [music]
[29:22] the way that he's made for us to come.
[29:25] And certainly the brothers that are
[29:26] taking the offerings, if you could come
[29:28] this morning, brother DN, if you could
[29:29] just [music] come and take this n before
[29:31] the church. Amen.

[45:00] places, but your heart pulled you to go.
[45:03] I mean, and and and see God. Where do
[45:06] you see God? In his word. [music]
[45:08] And when you when you eat,
[45:11] you know, a lot of times when you sit at
[45:13] the table,
[45:15] sorry, brother Matthew, it's just
[45:17] [snorts] it's just how it is when we sit
[45:19] at the table. Sometimes I'll sit at the
[45:21] table and eat with brother Matthew and
[45:22] we just discuss how good the tenders are
[45:24] or how good the barbecue is. Just simp
[45:28] simplicity
[45:30] &gt;&gt; and the taste and the seasoning and all
[45:32] these things that have got and got done
[45:35] behind the scenes so you can enjoy a
[45:36] meal. I mean, it took work
[45:39] &gt;&gt; and you ate it in 30 minutes. I mean,
[45:42] it's so good and now you're full. Amen.
[45:46] Never forget that is the grace of God
[45:48] that he came and he prepared a meal for
[45:51] you.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And it's not something that's humanmade.
[45:54] It's something that's the almighty God
[45:56] had made this meal that once you eat out
[45:59] of it, you'll never hunger again. Praise
[46:01] the Lord. Once you drink out of this
[46:03] word, you'll never thirst again. I mean,
[46:06] that's that's the way he works. He
[46:08] doesn't give you something that will
[46:09] perish. He gives you always something
[46:11] that's eternal.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that perishes in God.
[46:14] There's no there's absolutely no harm.
[46:16] There's no fault in God and his word.
[46:19] He's always perfect.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; So, there's no perversion of his word.
[46:23] It's it's true genuine. I mean, receive
[46:26] him this morning. Are you happy to be
[46:27] here?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; We greet you in the name of the Lord
[46:29] Jesus. It's I'm just looking at your

[46:48] there's a lot of Brother Tim, Brother
[46:51] Orlando, we love you. You guys have been
[46:54] missed. God bless you. Amen. [music]
[46:57] We just greet you in the name of the
[46:59] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And we just
[47:02] want to bring you a few greetings from
[47:03] our local church, Nazareth Tabernacle. I
[47:06] mean, we're serving there and the Lord's
[47:09] been doing wonderful things.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Um, his word will never come back
[47:15] without
[47:16] I mean he he his word will always come
[47:19] back bringing fruit.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; And it's not the fruit of man. It's the
[47:23] fruit of the word.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Man never gets credit because the God is
[47:27] not a respector of person. So what what
[47:29] happens is the word is the one that
[47:31] brings the seed and and we're thankful
[47:34] for that. The Lord's, you know, is
[47:36] growing our little body there. Keep us
[47:38] in prayer. Are the battles just as hard
[47:40] there as as it is here. We're fighting
[47:43] against the same spirits. We're fighting
[47:44] against the same uh
[47:48] it's just true. It comes without even
[47:50] you expecting. That's why you have to be
[47:51] guarded.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; You're living in the day of a war. It's
[47:56] it's a spiritual war. So, you have to be
[47:58] protected at all times. You have to you
[48:00] have to be able to know how to block.
[48:02] You have to be be able you have to know
[48:04] how to respond
[48:06] because people these days don't fight
[48:08] with swords and shields and knives and
[48:10] they fight with words. They fight with
[48:12] actions. They fight with attitude. Amen.
[48:16] It's just how it is. So, be protected.
[48:18] Be be shielded, Brother Ben. Amen. Be
[48:21] dressed into the armor of the Holy
[48:23] Ghost.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to welcome my family. I
[48:26] don't know where they are.
[48:28] I appreciate them very much. I love them
[48:30] very much. They they mean so much to me.
[48:33] Everything that we are doing. If it
[48:35] wasn't for my family, I couldn't do it.
[48:38] It's just the way I That's just the way
[48:40] that it's my testimony. I couldn't do it
[48:42] without my family. So, just pray for
[48:44] them. We love them. God bless you,
[48:46] Sister Holly. Amen. And my kids. We
[48:50] thank you for the hospitality here in
[48:52] Dallas Fort Worth. We we feel we feel
[48:56] like kings.
[48:58] We do. And that's just the scripture.
[49:00] That's just how Thank you, brother
[49:02] David, for the opportunity to be here.
[49:05] He's a close friend to my heart. We've
[49:07] we've served here for a lot of years.
[49:09] And you'll always be a special people in
[49:11] my heart. Amen. In one day, we'll see on
[49:14] the we'll see each other on the other
[49:16] side. And you won't be for five minutes,
[49:17] 30 minutes, an hour, Brother Billy. But
[49:19] it'll be for how long? [snorts]
[49:21] Hallelujah.
[49:23] I mean, yeah, that's the type of love we
[49:25] have to have. It has to be expressed
[49:27] here before it could be expressed there.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't say right. It has to be
[49:31] expressed here because when we see each
[49:33] other, you'll use the same exact love to
[49:35] be able to recognize your brother.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the character is the love
[49:39] that God gave you. So, when you see each
[49:41] other, you excited to see your brother
[49:42] and I'll be like, "Oh, you made it,
[49:44] too."
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. It's true.
[49:51] I want to be excited to see you.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God I mean he gave his
[49:56] only begotten son,
[49:58] &gt;&gt; right? So whosoever believeth in him
[50:00] shall not perish but have eternal or
[50:02] everlasting life. God bless you. If you
[50:05] have your scriptures, let's just open
[50:06] this morning. We're just going to have a
[50:10] small thought that the Lord placed upon
[50:12] my heart and
[50:22] Isaiah chapter 60 verses 1 through 1,
[50:26] two, and three.
[50:30] Isaiah chapter 60:es 1-3. And I want to
[50:34] be an encouragement for you this
[50:35] morning. I don't know. I don't know your
[50:37] condition. I don't know the way you
[50:38] walked in. I have no idea. All I know
[50:41] that there is a word that knows it all.
[50:43] And it's the word that goes and discerns
[50:45] into the intent of the heart and gives
[50:47] you the medication and what you need. So
[50:50] you can go and and and pull upon the
[50:52] word if it's inside of you because the
[50:54] only way that you can pull in the word
[50:55] if it's in you.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; You cannot you cannot how can I say
[50:59] this? The word is already in you. You
[51:01] just have to get it discovered.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; And so when you get it discovered is a
[51:04] revelation. And the revelation gives you
[51:06] love.
[51:08] I believe that
[51:10] &gt;&gt; because we're living in the capstone,
[51:12] &gt;&gt; right? It's a capstone coming down. So
[51:14] when you catch the revelation of the
[51:16] age, you're catching divine love. If
[51:19] it's not producing divine love, then
[51:21] it's perverted and it's all all it is.
[51:24] It it's uh it's it's just doctrine. I
[51:28] don't want to say it's it's doctrine,
[51:29] right? It's letter. But really, the
[51:32] revelation of Jesus Christ is love
[51:34] because Jesus Christ was the love of
[51:36] God. And the love of God became flesh
[51:38] and dwelt among us and is living among
[51:40] us right now. SL praise the Lord. How do
[51:42] you know them? By their love.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; So express the love of Jesus Christ,
[51:47] that divine love that he wants you to
[51:49] have because that's the light.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; The love is the light.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; He was the light and that's the light.
[51:56] Isaiah 60 one through one, two, and
[51:59] three. Arise, shine, for thy light is
[52:03] come
[52:05] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[52:09] thee.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; So it's not upon somebody else if this
[52:12] is personal.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; So it's risen upon who?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; You.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're it's it's risen upon you.
[52:21] The sunshine now. The sun is upon you.
[52:23] For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[52:26] earth. How many of you can say this
[52:28] morning that this world is covered in
[52:29] darkness? If you have spiritual eyes,
[52:32] you would be able to see it. If your
[52:33] eyes are not spiritual, you're partaking
[52:35] of Sodom and Gomorrah. But may God open
[52:38] all of our eyes so we can read in
[52:40] between the lines and understand that
[52:42] that the position or the world the way
[52:44] it is this day, it's so dark that people
[52:47] don't even know where they're going.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; It's like walking with canes. You know,
[52:52] you're walking with the cane and you
[52:54] don't know where the next step is
[52:55] because all they're doing is guessing.
[52:57] And God doesn't guess. God knows.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God doesn't guess. He knows
[53:03] because he is everything. He's alpha,
[53:05] omega. He's the beginning and the end.
[53:07] He's all the in between. Amen. And he
[53:10] he's always going to be. It'll take
[53:12] eternity for God to express himself.
[53:14] Even on the other side, it'll be
[53:16] eternity to express eternity
[53:18] &gt;&gt; because there's absolutely no end. Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And so there's no more time, but we're
[53:22] in eternity walking with him until we
[53:24] get a body change. How many believe for
[53:26] that?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Right? Because he's going to come back
[53:29] and he's not going to ask you, did you
[53:30] buy faith?
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Did you work for faith?
[53:39] Did you did do you have in your back
[53:41] pocket?
[53:43] No. He's going to ask you, do you have
[53:45] it?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Because it's the token. Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; It's the way that you will be changed.
[53:53] It was the Abrahamic covenant that we
[53:55] had in the beginning.
[53:57] [clears throat]
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Darkness shall cover the earth and grows
[54:00] darkness the people.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; But the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[54:05] his glory shall be seen upon thee.
[54:08] Hallelujah. Now you there's only one f
[54:11] one type of glory and that's the glory
[54:13] of God.
[54:15] People want to receive glory, but
[54:16] there's only one kind of glory, and this
[54:18] is the glory of God. And his glory is
[54:21] humble.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And the Gentile SHALL COME TO THY LIGHT.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So that means that you
[54:28] produce such a light that you will be
[54:29] able to magnetize people to your light.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Because it's so dark. Imagine. I
[54:36] apologize that I'm keeping you standing
[54:38] for a few moments, but that's just uh
[54:41] imagine if it'd be total darkness in the
[54:44] room and all of a sudden I have brother
[54:46] Dylan just have a little candle light.
[54:50] Wouldn't everybody want to go next to
[54:51] the light so they can see, hey, let's
[54:54] get out of here somehow
[54:56] &gt;&gt; because I don't know where the exits
[54:58] are,
[55:00] &gt;&gt; right? Because light produces something,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; right? gives you introduces you to
[55:05] something I mean that's greater. It's an
[55:08] exodus. It's a going away. It's not I
[55:10] mean THIS THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR US TO
[55:12] STAY.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; This message IS PREPARING OUR BRIDE TO
[55:16] GO HOME.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So are are we prepared this morning? Are
[55:21] your hearts dressed in the word this
[55:22] morning?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say that. And the GENTILES
[55:26] SHALL COME TO THE LIGHT AND KINGS and
[55:28] the and kings to the brightness of thy
[55:30] rising.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Gentiles shall come to
[55:34] that light and kings to the brightness
[55:36] of that rising. Romans chapter 8 verse
[55:38] 28. Just a few more verses and we can
[55:40] sit down,
[55:51] very known scripture.
[55:54] We know that the Holy Ghost brings these
[55:56] things to your remembrance. It's not
[55:58] it's not something new, but it's
[56:00] inspired so that way you can you can the
[56:03] Lord can quicken it to your heart. Amen.
[56:08] And we know now, do you know?
[56:12] Verse 28, and it says, "And we know."
[56:16] So the question is, do you know
[56:18] &gt;&gt; that all things work together for good
[56:21] to them that love God? Amen.
[56:25] [clears throat]
[56:25] &gt;&gt; To them who are called according to his
[56:29] purpose.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; For whom he did forno, he also did
[56:34] predestinate
[56:36] &gt;&gt; to be conformed to the image of his son.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; So the point is is that we have to be
[56:45] conformed to the image of his son. And
[56:48] he only had one son that was able to
[56:50] bring restoration back in flesh and that
[56:53] was Jesus Christ.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Now not a two Jes NOT A JESUS CHRIST
[56:57] 2,000 years ago but a JESUS CHRIST THAT
[57:00] CAME IN MALACHI 4:5
[57:03] &gt;&gt; because that was the PROMISE THAT CAME
[57:04] TO ABRAHAM. A mazdc had TO COME SHOW THE
[57:07] LIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE IT AND BECOME THE
[57:09] SAME EXACTLY like
[57:11] &gt;&gt; I mean it's YOUR PROMISE. DID YOU KNOW?
[57:14] Did you know?
[57:16] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; From whom he did for know, he also did
[57:21] predestinate.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. How did he predestinate you? By a
[57:26] word that came out of a prophet's mouth.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU HAD TO BE BORN in this
[57:33] generation.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So he can call your name.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY WORTHY TO OPEN
[57:38] THE BOOK BUT HIMSELF.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And it was the lamb that came and took
[57:42] the book.
[57:43] And it was only a few that received it
[57:46] after the book was open because
[57:47] everybody fleeed from brother Brandham
[57:49] whenever the opening of the seals came
[57:50] forth.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Right? Because he was calling your name.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NO LONGER ABOUT THE FIRST AND THE
[57:56] SECOND. IT WAS NOW ABOUT THE THIRD WHICH
[57:57] WAS THE BIG FISH.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The rainbow fish. The fish
[58:02] that has the seven colors.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE ONE the one that knew it WAS
[58:06] THE CATCH.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; GOD IS A GOD OF RECORD. If you if you
[58:10] didn't know that he's a god of record.
[58:13] There's always something bigger. You
[58:15] know,
[58:17] have you ever seen a trout that big?
[58:18] Well, you know, the prophet caught it.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; It But it was it was it was trained by
[58:24] God to do that.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; It was the word of God now becoming
[58:29] flesh to call your name,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; to call you out of an Egypt and to take
[58:34] you into a promised land. Praise the
[58:36] Lord.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. to be conformed to the image of
[58:40] his son, that he might be the firstborn
[58:42] among many brethren. Moreover, whom he
[58:45] did predestinate, them he also called,
[58:48] and whom he called, them he also
[58:50] justified, and whom he justified, them
[58:52] he also glorified.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I know you know, but I'm just
[58:57] re-emphasizing emphasizing it. It's
[59:00] justified as in it's already been
[59:02] passed. Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; So remember, did you know that when he
[59:07] predestinated you, he's already given
[59:09] you the result into justification,
[59:12] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[59:15] Holy Ghost.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; But you have to be called by that voice.
[59:19] You have TO BE CALLED BY THAT word
[59:22] &gt;&gt; because it was it it's the word that
[59:24] that attracts you.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; If you were written by the word, it was
[59:28] it would be only the word that could be
[59:30] able to describe you. If you're a
[59:32] written epistle, people have to read YOU
[59:34] TO GET TO KNOW YOU,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Like a a book a book doesn't
[59:39] talk.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; A book doesn't talk.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Does anybody have a book that Unless you
[59:48] have these AI ones where they they put
[59:51] the computer inside the book.
[59:54] Think about it. And then it but a book
[59:56] don't talk.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; A book is read.
[59:59] But when they read it, they read the
[1:00:01] word of God.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And you're a book. You're a book. And
[1:00:05] when people read you, they read what's
[1:00:07] inside of your heart.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; They read, they live, they read what's
[1:00:11] inside of your book.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 31.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things?
[1:00:22] If God before us,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Hallelujah.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Father,
[1:00:32] Lord, in simplicity, we just want to
[1:00:34] encourage your bride this morning, Lord.
[1:00:37] We
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; We know we can't do nothing without you.
[1:00:40] We are absolutely just a piece of clay,
[1:00:43] a hand of dirt, Lord, that you've just
[1:00:46] created. But, Father, we know that it's
[1:00:49] your spirit that gives life. And so
[1:00:51] Lord, this morning, may you, Lord, your
[1:00:54] Holy Spirit, may your word be here in
[1:00:57] our midst to be able to just discern the
[1:00:59] hearts of our the condition of our
[1:01:01] hearts and give us the medication that
[1:01:03] we need, Father, to be able to walk from
[1:01:05] this place closer to you, Lord. Your
[1:01:08] your home here, the church is a place of
[1:01:11] correction. This is where we come, Lord,
[1:01:13] and you correct us. You lead us. You
[1:01:15] instruct us, oh Lord. This is a place
[1:01:17] where your bride gathers together to
[1:01:19] worship you, to lift up your name,
[1:01:21] Father. Lord, it's it's it's the image.
[1:01:24] It this is this is what you've called us
[1:01:26] to be to be in fellowship, Lord. This is
[1:01:29] this was the image that you had in the
[1:01:30] beginning for your bride to be able to
[1:01:32] be together, Father. And so, we just ask
[1:01:34] that you are welcome in our midst this
[1:01:36] morning. May you take control. May you
[1:01:38] take every thought under your control,
[1:01:40] Father. May you be, Lord, a speaker. May
[1:01:43] we just trust upon all that would be
[1:01:45] said that would be that would encourage
[1:01:47] the bride here locally. We thank you
[1:01:50] Lord. You can anoint a man all you want,
[1:01:52] but the bride has to be anointed just as
[1:01:54] well, Father, for us to be able to
[1:01:56] receive the word. So I pray that you
[1:01:58] anoint her ears that it wouldn't just
[1:01:59] come one out of one ear and go the
[1:02:01] other, but Lord, but may it come down
[1:02:03] into the heart and root love in there,
[1:02:05] Father. Clean up what it needs to clean
[1:02:07] up, Lord. Restore what needs to be
[1:02:08] stored, Father. Because we living in a
[1:02:11] day where darkness is upon this upon
[1:02:13] this world and it's trying to influence
[1:02:15] the bride of Jesus Christ, away from a I
[1:02:19] mean away from your rapture, away from a
[1:02:22] body change, away for a a greater
[1:02:24] maturity that you've called us for,
[1:02:26] Lord. And may we always be stable upon
[1:02:30] upon this upon this path that you've
[1:02:32] given us. May we never waver left to
[1:02:34] right. May we always try to stay in the
[1:02:36] middle of the ground, Father. May you
[1:02:37] always correct our hearts and may we be
[1:02:39] children of obedience. Oh Lord, don't
[1:02:42] make us. We don't want to be a children
[1:02:43] of disobedience. I want to be a child
[1:02:45] that obeys your word. Father, REGARDLESS
[1:02:47] IF IT STRIKES MY HEART, IF IT JUDGES my
[1:02:50] exterior, if it cleans me out, Lord, I
[1:02:52] want to take it because I know it's for
[1:02:54] the good. Oh Lord, when you when we love
[1:02:56] you, we know that all things work for
[1:02:58] the good. And we appreciate you for
[1:03:00] doing that for us this morning. May you
[1:03:02] take control. In the name of the Lord
[1:03:03] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. and
[1:03:06] God bless you. You can have your seats.
[1:03:11] I want to speak just for a few moments
[1:03:14] this morning on the mystery of his will.
[1:03:18] And the Lord just kind of was working on
[1:03:20] my heart a few weeks ago. And and it's
[1:03:24] so important to know what a will is
[1:03:27] because you know he has a mystery of
[1:03:29] something that he has left behind for
[1:03:31] you to be able to inherit. And so you
[1:03:34] understand this this this didn't come by
[1:03:38] guessing.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Or let me put it this way. God didn't
[1:03:43] volunteer you to come.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; God God don't need volunteers.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't say would you. No. When he
[1:03:51] went and called Peter, when he went and
[1:03:52] called Matthew, when he went and called
[1:03:54] all his disciples, he says, "Come follow
[1:03:57] me."
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask them. All he did is he
[1:04:00] told them. And whatever they were doing
[1:04:02] at that moment, they left their fishing
[1:04:05] poles, they left their boats, they left
[1:04:07] everything they had and they went to
[1:04:09] follow Jesus because they knew that the
[1:04:13] word was going to come in their midst.
[1:04:15] How? Well, they knew the scripture. So
[1:04:17] when they seen the living word in their
[1:04:19] midst, they says, "Oh, this must be that
[1:04:21] Messiah,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; right?" Because the book was not read.
[1:04:26] And that gave confidence to the
[1:04:27] DISCIPLES TO SAY, "NOW the word IS IN
[1:04:29] OUR MIDST. WHAT WILL HAPPEN? 30 years
[1:04:32] that God had trained you. I mean, think
[1:04:34] about it. 30 years that Jesus Christ had
[1:04:37] lived on this earth for a three and a
[1:04:40] half year journey
[1:04:42] to fulfill all that he fulfilled. How
[1:04:44] many scriptures were fulfilled within
[1:04:46] that lifetime of three and a half years
[1:04:47] that he he preached the gospel and he
[1:04:49] went and and cleaned out the
[1:04:51] tabernacles?
[1:04:53] Think about it. He went and he turned
[1:04:55] the tables over and he healed the sick
[1:04:58] and all he did he did good. BUT BECAUSE
[1:05:00] HE DID GOOD, people were going against
[1:05:02] him, calling him a bellzeub,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; BUT ALL HE DID WAS GOOD.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WERE PEOPLE WERE FOLLOWING HIM,
[1:05:08] SAYING, "I heal me. I need I need
[1:05:11] healing. I need this. I need that." And
[1:05:13] that was good. But remember when the
[1:05:16] WHEN THE CHANGE HAPPENED WHEN NOW HE WAS
[1:05:18] PREACHING THE WORD OF GOD, CALLING,
[1:05:20] GOING DEEPER, and saying, "Okay, you
[1:05:22] love me that much. Now, let me speak
[1:05:25] this. Let me speak these mysteries to
[1:05:27] you that only the elect can be pulled by
[1:05:30] these because those are the ones that
[1:05:32] read IT IN BETWEEN THE LINES.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Not all that call being Lord, Lord shall
[1:05:38] inherit,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; right? Because God had given you
[1:05:41] something special for you to be able TO
[1:05:43] BE ATTRACTED BY this word
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; and not just any word is the fullness of
[1:05:48] the word. The word has been restored BUT
[1:05:50] YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF IT. PRAISE THE
[1:05:52] LORD.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. In Ephesus, they had a portion in
[1:05:55] Smith. They had a portion and they had a
[1:05:57] portion all THE WAY TO THE LAST TO THE
[1:05:59] LAST church age. But now that the last
[1:06:01] CHURCH AGE HAS STOPPED, TIME HAS ended
[1:06:04] and eternity HAS STARTED BECAUSE NOW YOU
[1:06:06] HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL WORD. Praise the
[1:06:08] Lord.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; You don't depend ON SOMETHING IN THE
[1:06:11] PAST, BUT YOU DEPEND ON SOMETHING IN THE
[1:06:13] PRESENT.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He wants you to get a God
[1:06:17] that's present.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; A revelation that's present. AMEN.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; A REVELATION THAT'S FOR TODAY.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; NOT A RE WHATEVER WAS YESTERDAY, if it
[1:06:27] wasn't eaten, you had to burn it.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; If you can follow me, can you can you
[1:06:30] guys follow a little bit?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; If you didn't eat it yesterday is no
[1:06:34] longer good because now you need
[1:06:36] something fresh.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; You could have you could have collected
[1:06:39] 12 baskets of mana.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; By the morning it was gone.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And then you woke up and somehow God
[1:06:47] supernaturally gave you new mana. And
[1:06:49] then you went and you ate.
[1:06:51] because that's God. That's the grace of
[1:06:53] God.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; So you always need new food. You always
[1:06:57] need good food. EVERY DAY YOU GOT TO YOU
[1:06:59] GOT TO EAT
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT GOD MATURES
[1:07:02] HIS BRIDE IS BY CONSTANTLY BEING IN
[1:07:04] FELLOWSHIP.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The world's changing.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Are you changing?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; The world's changing and it's not for
[1:07:14] the good.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; BUT DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT CHARACTER TO
[1:07:17] OVERCOME THE CHARACTER that's trying to
[1:07:19] come against you?
[1:07:20] RIGHT? BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE SUCH A
[1:07:22] LOVE. NOW, think about this because
[1:07:24] there there will come a time where the
[1:07:27] evil is going to be so so bad that
[1:07:30] you're going to have to love your
[1:07:31] neighbor your neighbor or you're going
[1:07:32] to have to love, you know, your enemy as
[1:07:35] yourself.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; So, God's going to be able to train you
[1:07:38] in such a way where you can love the
[1:07:39] enemy as yourself.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because because it's the condition
[1:07:44] that the people are living in.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; They're drinking. They're marrying.
[1:07:48] They're concentrating upon their image.
[1:07:50] They're concentrating on who can have
[1:07:51] the best followers. I'm just speaking of
[1:07:53] what's going on in the world. I'm sure
[1:07:54] we all know. I mean, how many thousands
[1:07:57] of views have I had on my little Tik Tok
[1:08:00] posting that I put? Because if I go over
[1:08:02] 50,000, Brother Billy, I start getting
[1:08:04] money. So, I want to be popular because
[1:08:06] the the more craziest things I could put
[1:08:08] on the internet, right, the the more
[1:08:11] followers I have and I can make money
[1:08:12] doing nothing, doing crazy things.
[1:08:14] Right?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; You see how now money is being earned
[1:08:17] and people are getting rich by being
[1:08:19] foolish, expressing what's in their life
[1:08:22] and people follow that and they get
[1:08:24] they're they're called influencers. And
[1:08:26] so ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE THEM START
[1:08:28] DRESSING LIKE THAT INDIVIDUAL. Start
[1:08:29] acting like that individual. Hallelujah.
[1:08:32] If there's a follower, I WANT TO follow
[1:08:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE LIKE JESUS CHRIST
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT IS THE image of God.
[1:08:41] That's right.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He left it for you to see it
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; and not an image of 2,000 years ago or
[1:08:47] image of today
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; because he spoke to you an image of
[1:08:51] today. How to overcome, not what to
[1:08:54] overcome, but how to overcome in the
[1:08:56] days that you're living in.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO CATCH IT BY revelation
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; because the breads and the fishes was
[1:09:04] only attracting.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; It was only attracting.
[1:09:10] But the ones that went all the way
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; was the ones that their names have been
[1:09:15] revealed out of the lamb's book of life.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; God would say in proving his word, I try
[1:09:25] to get this quote so we can just walk
[1:09:27] through a little bit.
[1:09:30] 1964 August 16, paragraph 210. Proving
[1:09:34] his word. He proves all of his words.
[1:09:39] Are you a word this morning?
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; So he proves all of his words. SO THERE
[1:09:45] WON'T BE NOT ONE WORD THAT HE WON'T
[1:09:47] PROVE.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; He's got to prove them all.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to have to prove them
[1:09:52] all from the from the little to the
[1:09:54] biggest.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; FROM THE BIGGEST TO THE LITTLE.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I MEAN FROM A CHILD I mean to the most
[1:09:59] mature.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; HE'S PROVING ALL OF HIS WORDS. Just
[1:10:03] think of it. All of his words. And you
[1:10:06] were his word. and he was the word and
[1:10:09] you were part of his word
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; and that's the reason you're sent here
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; to confirm your place in life.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Why were you sent here?
[1:10:24] So your birth, the prophet says that is
[1:10:28] more of a paradox than the birth of
[1:10:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; I I I didn't know what to think when the
[1:10:35] prophet said that. I'm serious because
[1:10:37] it's such a humble and if Jesus Christ
[1:10:39] was overshadowed by the angel and here's
[1:10:42] Mary receiving the word in her womb and
[1:10:45] and she carried that word inside of her
[1:10:48] for for nine months and he has to leave
[1:10:50] I believe he has to leave Nazareth to go
[1:10:52] to Bethlehem and it was a journey of a
[1:10:55] few days and Mary sitting on a donkey
[1:10:57] and there was no place for him to go lay
[1:10:59] in
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; and so they find a barn and the prophet
[1:11:03] says that his first clothes was the
[1:11:05] actual
[1:11:06] I mean the covering the blanket of a
[1:11:08] donkey
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; that Mary had rode for so many days.
[1:11:12] They took the blanket of a donkey and
[1:11:13] they wrapped Jesus Christ in this
[1:11:15] blanket because Jesus I mean my birth
[1:11:18] wasn't like that.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; But I do know this that if he did that
[1:11:22] he did it for me.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; If he came that way was to come and
[1:11:27] redeem me. Praise the Lord. TO SHOW THAT
[1:11:29] THIS LIFE HAS NO IMPORTANCE
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAS SOMETHING GREATER FOR
[1:11:33] YOU.
[1:11:35] AMEN.
[1:11:36] Remember the devil had perverted the
[1:11:38] original because he cannot create.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; So all he did is perverted what God had
[1:11:43] created in such a way that he wanted you
[1:11:46] to see THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT these things
[1:11:48] that you put your five senses on but
[1:11:50] it's about the five senses of the
[1:11:52] spiritual realm that you have to
[1:11:54] understand.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And out of, think about it, out of
[1:11:58] a million germs, the prophet says that
[1:12:01] God chose one germ to unite with, you
[1:12:05] know, the the other half of the world to
[1:12:07] to to the earth, right? And so them two
[1:12:10] created a gene that now was born into
[1:12:13] existence.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That gene, the prophet says, was a
[1:12:18] supernatural gene
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; because it came from your grandfather,
[1:12:21] your great greatgrandfather,
[1:12:23] your great great. So God watched over
[1:12:25] your seed.
[1:12:28] You're not a nobody.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Just like Jesus had a flesh where the
[1:12:36] spirit could unite with it. You have a
[1:12:38] flesh where your spirit could unite with
[1:12:40] that word.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Think you have to. IT'S YOUR SPIRIT.
[1:12:43] YOU'RE SUPERNATURAL.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE INTO THE
[1:12:46] SUPERNATURAL. YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT A
[1:12:50] HUMAN. A lot of people CALL US ALIENS.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; YEAH. be think about especially the
[1:12:56] immigr on the immigration side when you
[1:12:58] get a passport they give you an alien
[1:13:00] number it's just the way the process
[1:13:02] happens here and they give and they know
[1:13:04] you by the alien number but we're
[1:13:05] absolute aliens we're not of this world
[1:13:07] we're pilgrims and strangers and once
[1:13:09] you start living in ETERNITY YOU'LL
[1:13:11] START SEEING YOURSELF HERE MORE LIKE
[1:13:13] JESUS CHRIST
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HE
[1:13:16] CREATED IN THE BEGINNING HE CREATED YOU
[1:13:18] TO be like him
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; it's now the expression time
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; do you know that you have been called
[1:13:24] according to his purpose.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; The purpose of God was for you to be
[1:13:31] here.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Now, find what to do with that.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Find what to do with that because God
[1:13:36] has something for you.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Even if I want to be even if God made me
[1:13:40] a doormat,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; You know what? I want to be a doormat.
[1:13:44] And you know, you know what I would do,
[1:13:45] brother Matthew? When people would walk
[1:13:47] in, I would tickle their feet
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; so they could have a smile on their
[1:13:52] face.
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; That's the expression of God. God is
[1:13:57] love.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; God is love.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; There's no there's no there's no evil in
[1:14:04] God.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; God doesn't God even his hate is in
[1:14:08] love.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; He can't hate.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; It's a perversion of love. So God is
[1:14:14] love. GOD GOD IS HIS THAT THAT THAT'S
[1:14:16] HIM. That's the way he expresses
[1:14:18] himself. SO GOD CALLED YOU to confirm
[1:14:21] your place in this life. Amen. Find your
[1:14:24] identity. Find find who you are. You
[1:14:27] know a will. Does everybody know what a
[1:14:31] will is? Like when you have an
[1:14:33] inheritance will
[1:14:35] every
[1:14:38] a few.
[1:14:42] A will. So a will is something that when
[1:14:47] somebody passes on,
[1:14:50] it's an abstract
[1:14:53] that leaves you your inheritance.
[1:14:55] And what's yours?
[1:14:59] You cannot change it. You cannot add to
[1:15:02] it. You cannot take away from it.
[1:15:05] It's written by the father. It's been
[1:15:08] sealed by the father. And it remains
[1:15:11] sealed by the father until everyone
[1:15:13] receives their inheritance.
[1:15:15] Even if in that inheritance is said, I
[1:15:19] have a child at 12 years old. He cannot
[1:15:22] inherit this until he's 18. His grace
[1:15:25] will allow it. Think about it. It's a
[1:15:27] natural I it's the grace of God because
[1:15:30] he wants he doesn't want to lose a one.
[1:15:34] That's why he depends on grace because
[1:15:36] he wants every single one of his words
[1:15:39] to come to pass.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He wants every single one of his
[1:15:44] children to come to maturity.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You can be grain, but remember, he's
[1:15:49] only coming for those that are mature,
[1:15:50] that are ripened. So, you have to sit
[1:15:52] under the ripening of the sun.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; You have to sit under the ripening of
[1:15:57] this word for you to be ready for
[1:15:59] harvest. Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet would say in the quote,
[1:16:02] "The combine's coming.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; The combine's coming."
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; What does the combine do? The combine
[1:16:08] comes and grabs the grain, separates the
[1:16:11] tears away from the grain, puts the
[1:16:13] grain in the machine, and when the
[1:16:14] machine gets to the barn, it deposits it
[1:16:16] and says, "It's done. It's over. All the
[1:16:19] elect are here.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Now, the great tribulation is going to
[1:16:22] have to start happening because they
[1:16:24] have to go through a cleansing. But the
[1:16:26] combine's coming. So, what are you going
[1:16:28] to do?" I Amen. LIFT UP YOUR EYES. LIFT
[1:16:30] UP YOUR HEAD BECAUSE YOUR REDEMPTION
[1:16:33] DRAWS NIGH.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You have to be aware in the times you're
[1:16:36] living in. Don't be FOOLED BY THE WAY
[1:16:38] THIS DEVIL'S TRYING TO PAINT A PICTURE
[1:16:40] OUT IN the other world for you. You got
[1:16:42] to stay in the real world.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Stay in Jesus Christ.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A will.
[1:16:50] It's an abstract. There's names in
[1:16:53] there. It has your date of birth.
[1:16:56] It has who you it has it has the the the
[1:17:00] funds and the assets that have been
[1:17:01] written in this will that the children
[1:17:04] get to inherit. Think about it
[1:17:07] because everything that's his is yours.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; And nothing can break this will nothing
[1:17:13] can break this abstract because God has
[1:17:15] wrote it for you. So all you have to do
[1:17:18] is get in the book and find your
[1:17:21] inheritance and what belongs to you
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; because this is you.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; HE CAME AND OPENED THE BOOK SO HE can
[1:17:28] read your name. So when he read your
[1:17:30] name, he didn't read your your human
[1:17:32] name, brother Gary or brother Dylan or
[1:17:37] uh Amen. He didn't read your normal
[1:17:39] name. He didn't he didn't read He didn't
[1:17:41] read your fleshly name. He read the
[1:17:43] word.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you are in the word. So when
[1:17:47] he called the word, he called you.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't call you by your natural name,
[1:17:54] BUT HE WENT INSIDE YOUR HEART and
[1:17:57] discerned your heart AND HE TOLD YOU
[1:17:59] THAT THIS IS HIM.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; SO NOW THAT HE'S IN YOU,
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; you can't do nothing but stay next to
[1:18:06] him
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; because that if you received him that
[1:18:09] way, if you didn't receive him that way,
[1:18:11] I say that may the Lord give you grace
[1:18:13] to receive him that way. Don't let it
[1:18:15] just remain up here.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Up here is good, but the devil's going
[1:18:19] to try to come and battle it out,
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; but once it's rooted in here,
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; the devil can't even read it.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; It's under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And nothing could touch it.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; You're safe.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to apply the blood.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to apply the blood.
[1:18:38] So when the angel comes, you're not
[1:18:40] disturbed.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So in this in this Amen.
[1:18:45] It shows in this will how much goes to
[1:18:48] each individual.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And he's always a fair God because he
[1:18:52] created Jesus so he can be the
[1:18:55] firstborn. But he didn't leave it there
[1:18:57] because Jesus was going to have brothers
[1:18:59] that were going to come, brothers and
[1:19:00] sisters that were going to come through
[1:19:03] that same. You have to come through the
[1:19:04] door. There's no other way. You have to
[1:19:07] come through the door through Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ so you can be just like he was in
[1:19:11] the beginning. He restored a word to you
[1:19:15] that when you receive that word by
[1:19:17] revelation, that's what transforms your
[1:19:19] body.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Not, oh Lord, how can I do this? Oh
[1:19:23] Lord, how can I accomplish this? That's
[1:19:26] not the way that God works. Lord, how
[1:19:28] can you accomplish this in my life?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And your word says that the Amen. seek
[1:19:34] the kingdom of God first.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And all these things.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Because it's not what I say. It's what
[1:19:45] he says. And if God gives YOU A FAITH,
[1:19:48] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY WHAT HE SAID.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU DEPEND ON WHAT HE SAID AND
[1:19:54] YOU LEAVE IT THERE ON WHAT HE SAID. IT
[1:19:56] DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE
[1:19:57] three months, 6 months, a year, two, it
[1:19:59] doesn't matter. Abraham waited 25 years
[1:20:02] for me promise that Mckedic told him,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; but one day it came to pass.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he he wanted him to
[1:20:11] understand, okay, it took 25 years,
[1:20:13] Lord, for me to get my son. I appreciate
[1:20:16] this, but now you're asking me to go
[1:20:18] sacrifice my only son.
[1:20:21] You're going to you're going to ask me
[1:20:22] to go kill my own son, the one that you
[1:20:24] gave me by promise. I've waited. I've
[1:20:26] made a mistake doing this.
[1:20:28] I I listened to Sarah and I made I MADE
[1:20:31] EVEN THOUGH GOD BLESSED ISHMAEL, I mean
[1:20:34] he it just shows the denominational side
[1:20:36] of perverting something that's not part
[1:20:38] of the truth. So you can you can be I
[1:20:41] mean you can you can be a vessel. You
[1:20:44] can be the seed of Abraham, but if you
[1:20:46] rush into a decision, you can create a
[1:20:48] denomination out of yourself. THAT'S WHY
[1:20:50] YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PROMISE OF THE
[1:20:52] OF THE OF THE LIVING GOD AT HIS PROPER
[1:20:54] TIME TO COME LIVE INSIDE OF YOU. AMEN.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; DON'T RUSH THE PROCESS.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; TRUST THE PROCESS.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; YOU RUSH THE PROCESS, IT'LL BE A
[1:21:04] DENOMINATION.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAS TO BE IN CONTROL OF
[1:21:07] EVERYTHING
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S THE HEAD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And you're the body
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; and the body does what the head
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; tells it to do.
[1:21:21] A lot of times a lot of times you you
[1:21:23] know our brains are so it's just the way
[1:21:26] it is. But you know you the command of
[1:21:30] reaching out your hand or maybe when you
[1:21:32] get burnt or maybe when something like
[1:21:34] you react so quick because your your
[1:21:35] brain is so I mean it's so
[1:21:39] God made it in such a supernatural way
[1:21:41] that he gave you that instinct to know.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But once he's sanctified under the
[1:21:46] Holy Ghost, it has the same effect
[1:21:48] spiritually. My brother and sister,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; these two have to come together.
[1:21:55] You can't let your flesh live one way
[1:21:58] and your spirit live another way.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; They'll always fight.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You have to grab this flesh and humble
[1:22:06] it
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; under the word of God
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; and it'll give you power. That's right.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; They have to unite together because it's
[1:22:14] not what you do. It's not what you say.
[1:22:17] It's what he says and what he does
[1:22:20] because he wants to prove every one of
[1:22:22] his words. And you are a word in this
[1:22:24] age that you have to be expressed. But
[1:22:26] you have to receive it by faith.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; And when you receive it, you have to
[1:22:30] take an action inside of it.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know what your inheritance is?
[1:22:39] Amen. Have you read the will of your
[1:22:42] father?
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Have you gotten there to read the book?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Have you gotten there? Have you gotten
[1:22:48] there to read that name that was written
[1:22:50] about you? BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU read
[1:22:52] in the message or in the Bible, YOU READ
[1:22:54] ABOUT YOU. YOU READ ABOUT what how God
[1:22:56] created you. How God manifested his love
[1:22:59] in you. And you SEE YOURSELF IN DAVID
[1:23:01] and you see yourself in in in Amen. You
[1:23:04] see yourself in Samuel. YOU SEE YOURSELF
[1:23:05] IN the disciples. YOU SEE YOURSELF
[1:23:08] THROUGH ALL THESE ALL THESE CHARACTERS
[1:23:10] that God had left in the scripture.
[1:23:12] Amen. BUT ALL THAT DID was that
[1:23:14] testimony was influencing you
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; because these are testimonies of the
[1:23:18] living saint. It's the living God,
[1:23:20] right? Because Abraham didn't have a
[1:23:23] Bible.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Or Noah didn't have a
[1:23:30] Bible. He had a plan to build build an
[1:23:33] ark. But Noah witnessed the pyramid
[1:23:38] which was a Bible
[1:23:40] because and Enoch the seventh from Adam.
[1:23:42] He was the one that was the constructor
[1:23:44] of the pyramid and and he was the one
[1:23:46] that built it in his days. And and after
[1:23:48] Noah I mean was taken away then I
[1:23:51] apologize. After Enoch was taken away
[1:23:54] then Noah started in his in his ministry
[1:23:57] of building an ark and preaching the
[1:23:59] gospel 120 years. And it was God that
[1:24:02] after 120 years had shut the door.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; 120 years and seven days, God shut the
[1:24:08] door and the grace was shut and it was
[1:24:10] just Noah and his family.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And so I just want to bring this to your
[1:24:14] remembrance this morning. Amen. I'm not
[1:24:17] saying it is, but could it be? We have
[1:24:19] to be we have to be aware of these
[1:24:20] things. 1906, 2026,
[1:24:23] 120 years. Noah preached 120 years. And
[1:24:27] as it was in the days of Noah,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; so shall it be.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Prophecies are being filled before you.
[1:24:38] You have to be up to date with what God
[1:24:40] is doing.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; You have to be living inside this word
[1:24:43] every day of your life because in in one
[1:24:45] day, he will change you.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, HE'LL CHANGE YOU IN SUCH A WAY
[1:24:51] THAT YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
[1:24:54] You'll just wake up on the other side.
[1:24:56] Amen. It was it was the overcome
[1:24:59] overcoming of this age was death. That
[1:25:02] was what was overcome in this age was
[1:25:03] death. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Now, Revelations 13:es
[1:25:09] 8 and 9, I just want to read these two
[1:25:11] verses because the beast and the spirit
[1:25:14] of antichrist is trying to come trying
[1:25:17] to come and deceive the very elect that
[1:25:19] if it'd be possible.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; So, he's trying to come your way to
[1:25:23] deceive you. Amen. and with mistruths,
[1:25:26] with false doctrines, with misinterpret
[1:25:28] word,
[1:25:30] right? I mean, it it's out there. I
[1:25:32] apologize. Maybe maybe I'm the only one
[1:25:34] that kind of is aware of that, but the
[1:25:36] Bible says that they'll come fight false
[1:25:38] Christ.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And it says you it says low one here,
[1:25:42] low one here, there's one here. Amen.
[1:25:44] And the only way that you know a tree is
[1:25:46] by its word and what comes out of him.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And so, you have to know the word for
[1:25:50] you to be able to discern the word that
[1:25:52] comes from someone.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a a PERSON'S KNOWN BY HIS
[1:25:56] CHARACTER, BY THE WORD THAT COMES OUT of
[1:25:57] him. And so you you WANT TO BE TRAINED.
[1:26:00] YOU want to be uh Amen. You want to be
[1:26:03] in season for this time that we're
[1:26:05] living in because the devil's trying to
[1:26:07] deceive the very ELECT IF IT'D BE
[1:26:09] POSSIBLE. BUT IT'S NOT possible
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; because he's done something to you that
[1:26:14] you cannot be deceived. That's right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; All that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:26:20] worship him. And all that dwell upon
[1:26:23] this is talking about the mark of the
[1:26:24] beast. And all that dwell upon the earth
[1:26:27] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:26:30] written in the lamb's book of in the
[1:26:32] book of in the book of life of the lamb
[1:26:34] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:26:37] If any man have an ear,
[1:26:43] let him hear.
[1:26:47] Now, we know that Revelations 13, the
[1:26:50] prophet clearly describes that this is
[1:26:52] America. It's 13 stripes, 13 stars, 13
[1:26:56] colonies, how we got started. And and it
[1:27:00] it's just interesting how in 1950, I
[1:27:03] believe in 1954, I know we all know the
[1:27:06] quote, the prophet talks about the pope
[1:27:08] coming out of United States and it nine
[1:27:11] months later, the pope was born
[1:27:13] September. So he preaches this 1954
[1:27:16] December and in 1955
[1:27:20] September this pope was born in Chicago.
[1:27:25] You you understand I'm I'm not saying
[1:27:28] anything. All I'm saying is that God
[1:27:30] fulfills his word at the right time.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And we have to be activated in our
[1:27:36] promises and our benefits and our
[1:27:39] inheritance to be able to overcome and
[1:27:41] deceive the devil. You have to be armed
[1:27:43] at all times.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this the devil, the
[1:27:47] affluence of this age is coming with so
[1:27:49] much pressure against you.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; And and you have to you you have to
[1:27:53] Amen. YOU HAVE TO SURPASS THIS PRESSURE.
[1:27:55] YOU HAVE TO RESIST THIS PRESSURE THAT
[1:27:57] COMES AGAINST YOU. IF NOT, AMEN. IF WE
[1:28:00] CANNOT RESIST THIS PRESSURE THAT COMES
[1:28:02] AGAINST US, OH LORD, DON'T LET ME FALL
[1:28:04] AWAY. LET ME be let ME BE PROPERLY
[1:28:07] TRAINED TO SURVIVE THIS PRESSURE THAT
[1:28:09] WANTS TO COME AGAINST US
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S TRULY a squeeze. IT
[1:28:13] SQUEEZES SOMETHING OUT OF YOU.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; IT REALLY DOES. It does something to
[1:28:17] you.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; But if you live in heavenly places in
[1:28:20] Christ Jesus, you won't even feel
[1:28:21] anything of this world.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to live in that
[1:28:25] inner room. That's why you have to live
[1:28:27] in that tent. That's why you have to
[1:28:29] live in a place, amen, where nothing
[1:28:31] would ever bother YOU. YOU WALK OUT, YOU
[1:28:33] WALK OUT OF THAT PLACE AND you are a son
[1:28:35] and daughter of God with authority over
[1:28:38] you, where you can cast out devils,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; right? Where you can speak the WORD OF
[1:28:42] GOD AND NOTHING WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND
[1:28:44] before it.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; The angel told the prophet this, if you
[1:28:49] can get the people to believe you,
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; he could have said if you could get the
[1:28:54] people to believe Jesus Christ,
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; he could have said you if you can get
[1:28:58] the people to believe. No, but he said
[1:29:00] if you can get the people to believe
[1:29:01] you.
[1:29:03] Now, I listened to the prophet for a few
[1:29:06] years now and all I hear the prophet
[1:29:08] preaching is Jesus Christ.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; So, if you can get the people to believe
[1:29:12] you, nothing shall stand before you. Not
[1:29:15] even cancer.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Not even spiritual cancer.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because we're
[1:29:24] living in the day of of cancer. And a
[1:29:26] cancer is an attachment of life that
[1:29:28] tries to come upon YOU AND SUCK THE LIFE
[1:29:30] OUT OF YOU. I mean extract the life out
[1:29:33] of you and get you into a stage where
[1:29:35] you have no life. But the WORD OF GOD
[1:29:38] EVEN CLEANS THAT UP. PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; NOTHING SHOULD STAND AGAINST YOU. IF GOD
[1:29:42] IS FOR YOU, NO ONE COULD COME AGAINST
[1:29:45] YOU. NOT EVEN CANCER.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN CANCER. WHY? Because he created
[1:29:52] you. He's done something to you.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:55] So let me ask you this. When Egypt was
[1:29:58] receiving all the plagues, when Moses
[1:30:00] was reading and he was given all the
[1:30:02] plagues by the power of the word, there
[1:30:04] was a people that God had chosen in Goan
[1:30:07] that not even their animals were
[1:30:08] touched.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God elected them.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing touched them.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; 10 plagues, last one was killing their
[1:30:22] firstborn. Nothing touched them. Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God had a will. And his
[1:30:28] will said, "My children will be
[1:30:30] protected. My bride won't suffer. My
[1:30:33] bride is raptured. My bride is already
[1:30:35] with me." Hallelujah.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR UNITING PLACE RIGHT HERE,
[1:30:39] RIGHT NOW.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM. They're they're
[1:30:42] uniting. This is the union right NOW
[1:30:44] BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM. WHEN WE
[1:30:46] LEAVE THIS PLACE, WE'RE GOING INTO A
[1:30:48] MILLENNIUM, MY brother and sister.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to I mean I I I WANT TO
[1:30:54] REST WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE. I WANT TO
[1:30:55] ENTER INTO THE DAY of rest.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; WHERE IT'S NOT MY WILL, LORD, but it's
[1:31:01] your will, Lord.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And let him carry you, not you carry
[1:31:05] him.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; You're not holding on to him anyways.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; It's him holding on to you.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you're in the bosom of
[1:31:14] Abraham.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; So if he loved you, he'll carry you all
[1:31:18] the way through.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; The process is trusting. Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Trust him.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Now, the bride won't be deceived
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; because she'll recognize her position
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; and what she'll stand for.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And nothing
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; can stand before you.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, not even death, not even death
[1:31:38] can stand before you. Do you do you
[1:31:40] believe that this morning?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we overcomers here this
[1:31:43] morning?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Don't let it just be on your lips. Let
[1:31:47] it let it ring in your life. Amen. where
[1:31:50] it produces such an atmosphere inside of
[1:31:52] you. Amen. Where nobody I mean NO DEVIL
[1:31:55] COULD GET NEAR YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Where they CAN RUN AWAY BEFORE THEY EVEN
[1:31:59] COME TOUCH YOU.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; YEAH. JESUS CHRIST. JESUS CHRIST STOOD
[1:32:06] ONE TIME BEFORE A DEMON. And the demon
[1:32:08] was crying BEFORE HE SAYS, "NO, don't
[1:32:12] [laughter]
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; let ME SAVE ME. SAVE ME. THROW IT IN THE
[1:32:17] PIGS.
[1:32:19] He did
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; and they ended up going and killing
[1:32:22] themselves in the water.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing shall stand before the bride of
[1:32:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Because she knows her position
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; and it's not your authority to begin
[1:32:33] with. It's his authority in your life.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; That's what stands for you. Praise the
[1:32:37] Lord.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; It's his authority.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:32:43] 1963. The mystery of his will. He has a
[1:32:46] will for you. Yes,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; you have to go and get your inheritance.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You have to get to to live this
[1:32:55] inheritance that he has left for you.
[1:32:57] Amen. I know it. I know. I know. We We
[1:33:01] probably hear the gospel so much. Think
[1:33:04] about it. You know, sometimes we could
[1:33:07] be overfed.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And you know what happens when you're
[1:33:10] eagle and you're overfed? You can't fly.
[1:33:17] That's right.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't fly if you're
[1:33:20] overfed. If you're so full, the body is
[1:33:22] not made in such a way. You can't fly.
[1:33:26] And if if you did, you'd be very low and
[1:33:29] maybe unbalanced somehow because you
[1:33:32] don't you're not used to this weight
[1:33:34] upon you and you don't know how you know
[1:33:36] you don't know your wings, how how they
[1:33:38] con I mean, think about it. But when you
[1:33:42] when you eat good, when you eat
[1:33:44] vitamins, because the prophet says that
[1:33:46] every promise in his word is like a
[1:33:47] vitamin. Hallelujah. I need more vitamin
[1:33:50] C. I need more vitamin Jesus Christ.
[1:33:53] Hallelujah. I need more vitamin of
[1:33:55] faith.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need more vitamin maybe healing
[1:33:58] in my body. I need MORE VITAMINS OF
[1:34:00] SPIRITUAL GROWTH IN MY LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:03] I NEED VITAMINS IN MY LIFE SO MY LIFE
[1:34:05] CAN PROVE THAT I'M A HEALTHY BELIEVER IN
[1:34:08] THIS MESSAGE. AMEN.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS MESSAGE BEING
[1:34:14] DISGRACED. I APOLOGIZE. THIS LIFE IS A
[1:34:17] HOLY LIFE THAT THIS PROPHET HAD
[1:34:18] RESTORED.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A JOKE.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S A REAL THING, MY BROTHER AND
[1:34:25] SISTER. AND I PROMISE YOU, YOU FOLLOW
[1:34:27] THE INSTRUCTIONS, IT'LL CHANGE YOUR
[1:34:29] LIFE.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'LL MAKE YOU A NEW CREATURE IN
[1:34:33] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; IT'LL CHANGE YOUR ABILITIES. IT'LL
[1:34:36] CHANGE YOUR DECISIONS. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR
[1:34:38] WANTS.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; IT'LL IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING THAT YOU
[1:34:43] have because now you have a filter.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Run it through the filter.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Run it through the filter. If it's not
[1:34:52] run by the filter, be careful because
[1:34:54] you're standing on a word of a man.
[1:34:59] and every word of man
[1:35:03] because heavens and earth will pass away
[1:35:05] but his word will never pass away. Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; His word will never pass away.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; His word will never pass away.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Testimonies, my healing,
[1:35:18] all of these things that happened here
[1:35:20] upon this earth that gave me a temporary
[1:35:22] walk with the Lord,
[1:35:25] all of these will pass away. And when we
[1:35:27] get to the other side, I'm gonna ask
[1:35:29] Abraham, Abraham, how did you make it
[1:35:31] here?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; He's going to say, Cosman, by grace.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that I did.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; It was all by grace. When the angel came
[1:35:40] and gave me the promise, he says, I'll
[1:35:42] bless your seed. Now, it didn't say,
[1:35:45] "Well, you know, sometimes it's going to
[1:35:46] be tough or No, he says, I'll bless your
[1:35:48] seed
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; and out of you, it's going to be like
[1:35:51] the sands of the it's going to be like
[1:35:53] the grains of the sand and the stars and
[1:35:55] the I mean, it's going to be a seed of
[1:35:57] faith.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Abraham's seed. Amen. It's by grace.
[1:36:00] It's by faith, my brother and sister.
[1:36:04] 1963,
[1:36:06] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:36:09] Christ is living through you. Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; So pregnant with his spirit that you are
[1:36:15] a prisoner to anything else.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; You're confined.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. To the gospel, confined to the
[1:36:24] word. And all the children that you can
[1:36:27] bring forth is that cuz you're a
[1:36:30] prisoner.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; You can't commit adultery. You're
[1:36:34] already pregnant.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; So think about this. Amen. Just to try
[1:36:40] to keep it simple, when
[1:36:44] somebody's pregnantated and now the
[1:36:46] wound has been sealed,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; no one can go try to leave seed again
[1:36:52] and and conceive. It's done.
[1:36:56] Hallelujah.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Once your life has been receiving the
[1:37:01] seed and has already united
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; with your flesh,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; no one can come
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; in you
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; and deceive the seed that's already in
[1:37:13] you.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; So, what are you worried about?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND IF YOU GO
[1:37:22] THROUGH THE PROCESS, GO THROUGH THE
[1:37:23] PROCESS WITH THE WORD BECAUSE HE'LL TELL
[1:37:25] YOU WHAT TO DO.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; HE'LL LEAD YOU. HE'LL GUIDE YOU. HE'LL
[1:37:29] BE IN YOU UNTIL THE END.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; GLORY. HE CAN'T TAKE A HOLD. The womb of
[1:37:36] life is closed to anything else. You're
[1:37:39] already HIS BY PREDESTINATION.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; THAT SEED has to come to life.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; No world CAN GET IN. OH, HOW WOULD WE'D
[1:37:48] LIKE TO STAY ON this for an hour and I'm
[1:37:50] sure you understand. See, Christ and his
[1:37:53] alone already finished. The the seed was
[1:37:57] there. The seed was already when was it
[1:38:01] put there? Before the foundation of the
[1:38:03] world
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; has predestinated us to eternal life.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; So when God pregnant you, he pregnant
[1:38:10] you before the foundation of the world.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; You didn't get saved now. You were
[1:38:16] always saved.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You were always saved.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Because you were born with this nature.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And God had to restore this nature that
[1:38:26] was inside of you.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And as soon as life and as soon as the
[1:38:33] lifegiving flow, the seed laying there,
[1:38:36] other things that just wouldn't come in,
[1:38:38] it wouldn't take hold. Just couldn't do
[1:38:41] it. But when that seed come in quickly
[1:38:44] is stopped up the womb. All the rest of
[1:38:48] the seeds was drove out. See like that
[1:38:51] and you become a prisoner surrounded in
[1:38:54] Christ. Christ in you his life bringing
[1:38:57] forth his evidence. Hallelujah. his
[1:39:00] signs. Look, bring in his signs of life
[1:39:04] as an evident as an evident of his
[1:39:06] resurrection, proving to the world that
[1:39:10] eternal life vindicates to the world
[1:39:14] that we're alive in him.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; That's why you're resurrected now.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; What did you resurrect? Your
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; theophony.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; That's what you brought to life.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. your subconscience
[1:39:29] has now woken up your conscience, your
[1:39:32] true conscience. And so now when you
[1:39:34] find the Jacob, not the Esau, because
[1:39:36] this these two will always be twins. You
[1:39:39] have an Esau and you have a Jacob. And
[1:39:42] only Jacob was able to have a name
[1:39:43] change, but this Esau sold his life, his
[1:39:47] proper birthright for a a bowl, a soup,
[1:39:50] a bowl. Oh, excuse me. A bowl of soup.
[1:39:53] I'm my Romanian is kicking in.
[1:39:57] So think about it. This Esau will sell
[1:40:00] his life
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; for a bowl of soup.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; But Jacob had to wrestle with the angel
[1:40:05] to get a name change. HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE WANTED THAT THAT
[1:40:10] BIRTHRIGHT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE KNEW THAT IF HE CAN BE
[1:40:15] THE FIRSTBORN, he has access to all the
[1:40:18] inheritance. Hallelujah. AND IT WOULD BE
[1:40:20] HIM THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE INHERITANCE.
[1:40:24] That's why it that's why this message is
[1:40:27] not a religion.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; It's a people.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a person.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; And God changed his name to Israel.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And out of Jacob come the 12 tribes.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That's it's a people.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; It's not a religion.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; And God's calling you personally. This
[1:40:47] is not a group thing.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; People want to make it a group thing.
[1:40:51] It's not a group thing.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; People in the world do group things
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; because they want to unite
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; and they want to have followers and
[1:41:00] influencers and they say, "Oh, look at
[1:41:02] us." And all of this, but God is not
[1:41:04] dealing with groups anymore. That's
[1:41:05] already been done.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; The last time God did that was through
[1:41:08] Malachi 4:5 and it was to bring a
[1:41:11] message. It was to restore it all and
[1:41:14] force. I mean, it was it nothing else is
[1:41:16] coming after this. the the next thing
[1:41:18] that's coming is going to be Moses and
[1:41:19] Elijah, the two olive trees that have to
[1:41:21] go to Israel. But for us Gentiles, it's
[1:41:23] over. We now we have to come to MATURITY
[1:41:26] AND FULFILL THE PROMISE THAT'S BEEN
[1:41:28] WRITTEN ABOUT YOU.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO COME TO THAT RAPTURING
[1:41:34] FAITH.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WAS GIVEN TO ABRAHAM
[1:41:38] WAS RAPTURING FAITH.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE LOOKED AT the theophony, he
[1:41:41] said, "Oh, I want to be like him." Amen.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Because that was the life that was put
[1:41:46] before us.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; When he looked at me, he says, "Oh,
[1:41:51] okay. This is the promise you're going
[1:41:52] to give me.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; I'm 90 years old. I don't know how I'm
[1:41:55] going to get this kid,
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to believe that by your
[1:42:00] word, you're going to change this body.
[1:42:02] You're going to make me young again.
[1:42:03] Even though I'm dead, somehow you're
[1:42:05] going to give me seed
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; and somehow you're going to produce
[1:42:08] Isaac." Hallelujah. And out of Isaac
[1:42:11] came Israel. Hallelujah. SO GOD PREPARED
[1:42:16] ABRAHAM.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; He prepared Abraham. Now I want to grab
[1:42:21] your attention here for just a second.
[1:42:24] What happened in the tent?
[1:42:31] Look at the attitude of Sarah.
[1:42:33] So the promise is coming. Okay, let this
[1:42:37] let this question be in your mind. What
[1:42:38] happened in the tent? What really
[1:42:40] happened in the tent? Because Sarah was
[1:42:43] the wife of Abraham and the promise came
[1:42:46] to Sarah that she'll conceive, right?
[1:42:50] Because Abraham he Abraham already knew
[1:42:54] he already welcomed the Lord in the
[1:42:55] home. He's already served them and there
[1:42:57] was three angels, right? And so he's s
[1:42:59] he's welcoming he's welcome welcoming
[1:43:01] them in, right? And and so all of a
[1:43:04] sudden here comes Melazdc and is
[1:43:07] discerning Sarah's heart and is giving
[1:43:08] her the promise in the tent as the
[1:43:10] prophet says. She was washing dishes or
[1:43:12] whatever she was doing in there. She was
[1:43:14] getting things ready and all of a sudden
[1:43:16] she didn't laugh out loud.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; But she disbelieved the word.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Huh? Me an old woman to have a child.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Now think about it because that was the
[1:43:29] word. That was the faith that came to
[1:43:31] Abraham. So what did he do in the tent?
[1:43:35] He discerned her heart and he gave her
[1:43:38] the promise.
[1:43:41] What does God do in your tent?
[1:43:43] He discerns your heart and he gives you
[1:43:46] the promise.
[1:43:50] The same thing.
[1:43:53] Where did Isaac take Rebecca?
[1:43:58] He took her into Sarah's
[1:44:01] and they conceived the son.
[1:44:04] See everything happens in the intimacy
[1:44:07] between you and the Lord. That's why
[1:44:09] it's in individual walk.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; You can hide yourself in the group. Very
[1:44:14] good.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And you could be a very religious
[1:44:18] person, really nice dressed in a suit.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Dressed in a nice beautiful skirt with
[1:44:23] your hair beautifully put out. Amen. You
[1:44:26] can be so holy. You can be so kind,
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; but if you're not sealed by the Holy
[1:44:31] Ghost, be careful
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; because you're walking a dangerous line.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; You want to have the blood of Jesus
[1:44:37] Christ seal sealing you. Not only
[1:44:40] interior of your home, but on the
[1:44:42] exterior of your home. So when you walk
[1:44:44] and you come in, you know what's
[1:44:46] covering you.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; There's only one blood that would be
[1:44:50] able to cleanse you from all unbelief,
[1:44:52] and that's the blood OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:44:54] APPLY THE BLOOD. DON'T JUST KEEP it or
[1:44:57] JUST HAVE IT. APPLY IT IN YOUR LIFE
[1:44:59] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WILL SAVE YOU FROM
[1:45:01] THIS WORLD.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WILL CLEANSE YOU from this
[1:45:04] world. But that's the hardest part. We
[1:45:06] we know too much. We're living in the
[1:45:09] age of artificial intelligence. AI. A a
[1:45:14] I don't know how they come up with those
[1:45:15] names, but you know, uh they want they
[1:45:19] they don't want you to think for
[1:45:20] yourself. They they want to think for
[1:45:22] you.
[1:45:24] They want to tell you what to do.
[1:45:28] You no longer make the apple cake this
[1:45:30] way. You can do this and do this and do
[1:45:33] this. But my grandma taught me this way.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; It was it was because there was love
[1:45:38] that was in it when my grandma made it.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And she put effort into making the pie.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Right. Because my grandma, she loved
[1:45:46] cooking. And so she gave me the recipe
[1:45:49] and she says, "Sister Holly, when you do
[1:45:52] a cake for brother, I I don't I'm not
[1:45:54] good at baking, but but you know, I'm
[1:45:56] just I'm just drawing a point so you
[1:45:58] understand.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; We no longer depend on the on on the
[1:46:02] living word of the of the living God.
[1:46:04] And we're dependent on what somebody
[1:46:05] else is telling me." But really, IT'S
[1:46:08] WHAT THE WORD SAYS, my brother and
[1:46:09] sister.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Really, it's the it's it's THE WAY THAT
[1:46:13] GOD HAD COOKED IT FOR YOU. I MEAN, HE'S
[1:46:15] ALREADY PREPARED A SEVEN COURSE MEAL FOR
[1:46:18] YOU.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You just HAVE TO GO ENJOY IT AND
[1:46:20] READ YOUR INHERITANCE, RECEIVE THAT
[1:46:22] INHERITANCE THAT GOD gave you and this
[1:46:24] will. Amen. And and it's not sometimes
[1:46:27] it's hard to fight against the flesh to
[1:46:29] settle this flesh down, just to be able
[1:46:31] to read a verse in the Bible just to be
[1:46:34] able to like sometimes, you know, you
[1:46:36] could be so disoriented. You could run
[1:46:38] around all day and you read a chapter
[1:46:39] like, "Lord, I don't even understand
[1:46:40] what I read.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I just did it just so I don't feel bad.
[1:46:47] because there's so much pressure.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; There's so much going on.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; But get on your knees first.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Cry out to God.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Have him change the condition that's IN
[1:46:58] YOUR HEART.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; GET UP,
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; READ YOUR SCRIPTURE, and you'll see the
[1:47:02] difference.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. BECAUSE NOW YOU YOU GOT YOURSELF
[1:47:07] UNDER THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF
[1:47:10] THE HOLY GHOST TO TALK TO YOU, TO SPEAK
[1:47:12] TO YOU. AMEN. WE HAVE TO HAVE RESPECT
[1:47:14] FOR THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WAS A RESPECTOR OF HIS WORD.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I MEAN, HE CAME DOWN JESUS HIMSELF AND
[1:47:22] RESPECTED HIS OWN WORD. Humbled himself
[1:47:25] as a son of man. Didn't have a place to
[1:47:27] lay his head, but he lived the life of a
[1:47:30] son of God.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And that's our calling. That's our
[1:47:34] election. I want to strengthen you in
[1:47:35] your calling on your election. Before
[1:47:37] you had a position in the church, first
[1:47:39] you had to be a son.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; You can be the best song leader you
[1:47:42] want. You can be the best preacher you
[1:47:44] want.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; You can be the best deacon you want.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; But be before God put you there, he made
[1:47:50] you a son first.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Their inheritance is the sunship.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Gifts and calling come without
[1:47:58] repentance and they'll be left behind.
[1:47:59] But his word,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; the inheritance will always stand, my
[1:48:02] brother and sister.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; And find yourself your find your
[1:48:05] election. FIND YOUR FIND YOUR WORD. FIND
[1:48:08] WHAT GOD WROTE ABOUT YOU.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF GOD CALLED YOU HOLY, BE HOLY.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS TO GIVE YOU LOVE, BE LOVE.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE CREATED YOU TO
[1:48:22] BE.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] think of it
[1:48:28] alive with God, our redeemer,
[1:48:32] who created us for the very same
[1:48:35] purpose, the church, and his creative
[1:48:38] life in us. That is Moses. Moses. Moses
[1:48:43] said, "By the word of God, let there
[1:48:44] come and there come flies." A God that
[1:48:47] can make flies can make squirrels. You
[1:48:50] guys believe that?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; God giving you the power of the spoken
[1:48:53] word. Now, it's not like
[1:48:57] uh let it be a car.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; I'm It's It's strange out there.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; I've been around it.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; I've been around it. I preach I preached
[1:49:09] around it.
[1:49:10] And God doesn't do that.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. When brother Brana
[1:49:14] was with Hatty Wright,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; what he told her was the testimony of
[1:49:19] the speak of the creation of the scrolls
[1:49:21] into existence.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And you know what the response of Hadty
[1:49:24] Wright was? It's nothing but the truth.
[1:49:29] In that moment when she recognized that
[1:49:32] the son of God was living the life, he
[1:49:37] says the presence came in that room and
[1:49:39] he says ask anything.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; He felt it. He knew it. And now it was
[1:49:44] her inheritance.
[1:49:46] [clears throat]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; She had to had respect for the word of
[1:49:50] God for the promise to come forth.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; So
[1:49:57] ask for a million dollars.
[1:50:00] Your sister's in the wheelchair.
[1:50:04] She needs healing.
[1:50:06] She could have done it. She was
[1:50:08] suffering.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; She was in bad pain. But no, she had
[1:50:12] something on her mind.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And that was the souls of her sons.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Now, if a word like that could do
[1:50:20] something for had it right, can it not
[1:50:22] do it for you?
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; And she was a sister. Now sisters,
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; where's your faith?
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; And she was a sister,
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; but she recognized the promise
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; and SHE SAID, "LORD, NOT MY WILL, BUT
[1:50:35] LET YOUR WILL BE DONE."
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT PROMISE CAME TO
[1:50:39] FULFILLMENT BECAUSE SHE PUT HER TRUST IN
[1:50:41] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; SHE PUT HER TRUST IN THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Now listen for paragraph 470. He can do
[1:50:55] whatever he wants to. He can create. He
[1:50:58] can do anything. He's God. The very same
[1:51:01] God that created life. You see that's in
[1:51:04] you. You're a prisoner. You can't speak
[1:51:08] it till he says speak it.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; So first he's got to you got to get it
[1:51:15] from him.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; And it Moses didn't do it out of his own
[1:51:18] will. Moses heard the word of God. God
[1:51:21] told him what to do. And when he went
[1:51:23] before Pharaoh, he had the word of the
[1:51:26] Lord in front of Pharaoh. And it was the
[1:51:28] word of God in front of Pharaoh that
[1:51:29] gave him authority.
[1:51:31] The fleece shall come if you don't let
[1:51:33] my people go.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; The frogs will come if you don't let my
[1:51:36] people go.
[1:51:38] Now, when he left there, it didn't
[1:51:40] happen right away.
[1:51:42] And Pharaoh, I'm sure, probably was just
[1:51:45] talking in the background. Well, again,
[1:51:47] this Moses, who does he think he is
[1:51:50] being able to do all these things? But
[1:51:52] you see, Janice and Jambers couldn't do
[1:51:55] that,
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; the impersonator.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; But Moses did
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; because it because Pharaoh had access to
[1:52:01] Jan Janice and Jambers and he could have
[1:52:03] told them, "Hey, stop the fleas." But
[1:52:05] they couldn't do that. They didn't have
[1:52:07] power of they didn't have the power of
[1:52:08] creation.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; It was just a perverted. They can do
[1:52:12] they can throw their stick and throw it
[1:52:13] into a snake and do all these all these
[1:52:15] other things you know that you can
[1:52:16] impersonate. But the word they couldn't
[1:52:18] do that.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; They had no access to that.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; But you know the access that was given
[1:52:23] TO THE BRIDE WAS THE WORD OF GOD WAS THE
[1:52:25] SPEAKING OF THE WORD MY BROTHER AND
[1:52:26] SISTER. Wasn't that what Revelations 89
[1:52:29] and 10 says? Revelations 10. After you
[1:52:32] eat the book, what do you do?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A
[1:52:37] CONDITION, LET YOUR FAITH COME FORTH.
[1:52:40] DRAW FROM I MEAN DRAW FROM THE BANK
[1:52:43] ACCOUNT, DRAW FROM THE BENEFITS THAT'S
[1:52:45] YOURS AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE 25 CENTS IN
[1:52:48] YOUR POCKET. AMEN. USE IT BY FAITH.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST LIKE BUYING A LOAF OF BREAD.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; LORD, you said it. I didn't say I'm just
[1:52:56] I just want to be faithful to your word.
[1:52:57] Your word says that by your stripes I'm
[1:53:00] healed.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; It don't matter how I feel. By your
[1:53:02] stripes I'm healed.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF I'M WORSE. By your
[1:53:05] stripes I'm healed. AND EVEN IF I DON'T
[1:53:08] GET HEALED, I'M STILL HEALED IN THE NAME
[1:53:10] OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. WHY?
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; NOW I GOT HEALED for eternity.
[1:53:14] Hallelujah.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; You don't lose with God.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T LOSE WITH GOD
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF GOD IS FOR YOU,
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU?
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Don't depend on your own abilities.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Lucifer depended on his own his own
[1:53:34] abilities.
[1:53:36] He wanted to, you know, he wanted to be,
[1:53:37] he wanted to be like God. He wanted to
[1:53:39] have followers. And, you know, that's
[1:53:42] when the first battle had happened was
[1:53:44] in heaven.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; It was the battle of of proudness.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; It was it he considered he he served the
[1:53:51] creation
[1:53:53] more than the creator. be very careful
[1:53:55] because we're living in an age where the
[1:53:57] mark of the beast is really wanting to
[1:53:59] make the you, the fleshly you come more
[1:54:02] into the existence than the Jacob in
[1:54:04] you.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to humble yourself
[1:54:09] under the word of God.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; It wants to it wants to do a lot of
[1:54:12] things to you to make you feel good. It
[1:54:14] wants to give you a life where you don't
[1:54:16] depend on God anymore. Think about it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; It wants to take all the abilities away
[1:54:20] to worship God anymore.
[1:54:22] I have a good job. Everything's all nice
[1:54:24] and dandy.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about praying for
[1:54:28] food anymore. The in in the old days,
[1:54:31] you know,
[1:54:33] uh when mo when Moses was trying to when
[1:54:37] when Moses was trying to lead the people
[1:54:39] of Israel out of Egypt,
[1:54:42] I'm we're going to close. I apologize.
[1:54:45] Um when when Moses was trying to bring
[1:54:48] the people out of out of Egypt into the
[1:54:51] promised land, the days the amount of
[1:54:54] days that God was allowing at the
[1:54:57] beginning to the process was 11 days. So
[1:55:01] Moses, God told Moses that in 11 days
[1:55:04] that they were going to try to make it
[1:55:05] to the promised land. It didn't take 11
[1:55:08] days. It took 40 years. Now in the 40
[1:55:11] years as they were coming out of Egypt
[1:55:13] going into the promised land, all of
[1:55:16] them were covered by the pillar of fire.
[1:55:19] All of them were covered by the cloud.
[1:55:22] All of them ate the mana that came from
[1:55:24] the wilderness. None of them had a need.
[1:55:28] If they did, Moses would remember the
[1:55:31] the brazen serpent. If if if the devil
[1:55:34] would come and and and invite one of the
[1:55:37] one of the believers into the camp, they
[1:55:39] would go to the brazen serpent and they
[1:55:40] would look at Calvary and they would
[1:55:42] know that as soon as you put your trust
[1:55:44] in Calvary, you would be healed. And
[1:55:46] they would they would there was no Amen.
[1:55:48] There was no there was no need. God was
[1:55:50] taking care of them. Amen. They were
[1:55:52] taking care of their homes. They were
[1:55:54] taking care of their shoes. They their
[1:55:55] shoes didn't wear out for 40 years. Man,
[1:55:57] give me some of those sneakers.
[1:56:00] I want to buy a pair and just wear it
[1:56:02] for 40 years.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Their clothes never wore out.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WASN'T THE PROCESS. That wasn't
[1:56:11] the inheritance. The inheritance was TO
[1:56:13] GO INTO THE PROMISED LAND.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; The inheritance was, "Okay, I see the
[1:56:18] pillar of fire. I see the cloud. Lord, I
[1:56:20] I know you're with us. I know I know
[1:56:23] that you're talking to us. I know I know
[1:56:25] these things. I've heard these things
[1:56:27] for 40 years. 40 years. I've heard this
[1:56:30] thing. I've heard this thing. I've heard
[1:56:32] this thing. But Moses was being
[1:56:34] persistent. WE GOT TO GO.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GO.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GO. AND ONE DAY THEY DID.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MOSES, JOSHUA
[1:56:44] BEING THE HOLY GHOST WENT AND TOOK HIM
[1:56:46] INSIDE.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Moses made a mistake. And his mistake
[1:56:53] was instead of speaking to the rock, he
[1:56:57] lit the rock. And because of that, this
[1:56:59] he didn't listen to the will of God. So
[1:57:01] think about this. A prophet used by the
[1:57:03] Lord
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; and disobeying one word and kept them
[1:57:06] away from the promised land
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; took him up to the mountain says, "I'll
[1:57:10] show you, but you cannot enter in." Why?
[1:57:14] Because he used his flesh in a moment he
[1:57:17] shouldn't have used his flesh.
[1:57:21] But Joshua was a follower of the
[1:57:23] message.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Joshua was always next to Moses.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; He was always He was always next Moses.
[1:57:28] What do we do? How can I help you?
[1:57:30] Moses. Amen. It was Joshua. It was the
[1:57:32] Holy Ghost. Amen. And And Joshua and
[1:57:35] Caleb was the ones that entered into the
[1:57:37] promised land. Do you believe that?
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:57:41] here's Moses. He comes off the scene and
[1:57:43] Joshua and Joshua and the group I
[1:57:46] believe if I'm not mistaken is Joshua
[1:57:48] chapter Joshua chapter 3 and Joshua the
[1:57:51] prophet says represents Ephesians. You
[1:57:53] know he was coming out of Exodus and
[1:57:56] going into the promised land and is
[1:57:58] showing the process of what it's like to
[1:57:59] get into the promised land. But even
[1:58:01] though these two million believers that
[1:58:03] were walking with Moses for 40 years,
[1:58:07] they missed something.
[1:58:10] There was something they missed that
[1:58:11] should have been done.
[1:58:14] They got comfortable because God was
[1:58:15] taking care of their needs so much
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; that they forgot they forgot to do the
[1:58:19] most important thing in their life.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; May I not be that this morning? I don't
[1:58:26] want to be just a drag alonger.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be just somebody drag me
[1:58:30] along just just, hey, come to church.
[1:58:32] Okay, fine. I'm just going to come sit
[1:58:34] down and see what the minister is going
[1:58:35] to what brother Billy's going to preach
[1:58:37] this morning. Oh, he preached about me
[1:58:38] again. and I don't like him.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; He spoke about me. Well, why does these
[1:58:43] preachers always have to speak about me?
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe God's calling you.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe God's correcting you.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe God's doing SOMETHING TO YOUR
[1:58:50] HEART. YOUR ATTITUDE, THE WAY THAT YOU
[1:58:52] RECEIVE the word matters.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU HAVE MARY HAD A DIFFERENT
[1:58:57] ATTITUDE.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, LORD, how this this in my
[1:59:00] life is going to come to pass.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Sarah the same way. even though she
[1:59:05] rushed. I don't know how this is GOING
[1:59:07] TO COME TO PASS.
[1:59:10] JESUS CHRIST IN THE GARDEN OF
[1:59:11] GETHSEMANE, I DON'T KNOW, LORD, IF
[1:59:13] SOMEHOW YOU CAN GET THIS CUP TO JUST
[1:59:14] PASS AWAY FROM ME. IT'S TOO HARD. But
[1:59:16] it's not my will. Let your will be done,
[1:59:18] Lord.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I want your will to be done. I want you
[1:59:21] to be the center of my life. I WANT YOU
[1:59:23] TO BE THE LEADER OF MY LIFE. I WANT YOU
[1:59:25] TO BE THE VERY PRESENCE IN MY LIFE THAT
[1:59:27] CARRIES ME THROUGH EVERY PROBLEM, EVERY
[1:59:29] SITUATION, EVERY SICKNESS. Because when
[1:59:33] you walk with him, it all changes.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; It's like an excursion. How how do you
[1:59:41] say this? Uh when you go on a is like a
[1:59:45] guide, like an excursion, right? Does
[1:59:46] that make sense when I say that?
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; An excursion. When you go and he takes
[1:59:49] you around, it's beautiful.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Regardless if it's the mountains and the
[1:59:53] valleys, when you're with him, it's the
[1:59:55] best vacation you could ever take.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Because he knows exactly what you like.
[2:00:00] That's right.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; He knows where to take you. He know He
[2:00:03] knows you. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING INSIDE OF
[2:00:04] YOU.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; HE KNOW HE KNOWS THAT. HE KNOWS YOUR
[2:00:06] EYES. He knows your ears. He knows your
[2:00:08] thoughts. He knows your He knows what
[2:00:10] you like to eat. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
[2:00:12] ABOUT YOU. HE'S INFINITE.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, YOU CAN'T HIDE AWAY FROM GOD.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE AWAY from God.
[2:00:19] You know when you hide away from God?
[2:00:21] Adam hid away from God
[2:00:23] when he
[2:00:26] sinned. Right.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; But who told you, Adam? Well, you know,
[2:00:31] I'm going to pass the blame and the
[2:00:33] blame is going to pass the blame and the
[2:00:34] blame is going to pass the blame. No, we
[2:00:38] have to be sons and daughters of God
[2:00:40] redeemed by this message of the hour. My
[2:00:42] brother and sister, this is our calling
[2:00:45] and election is not just to know the
[2:00:47] message, but to be resurrected in the
[2:00:52] message
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; because this message is a resurrection.
[2:00:56] Now if you turn to Joshua chapter 5 just
[2:01:00] for a few moments.
[2:01:02] So remember they they they were walking
[2:01:04] with the message 40 years and they were
[2:01:07] benefited by every promise that God had
[2:01:11] given them. Moses was their leader. The
[2:01:13] message was their leader. He was taking
[2:01:15] care of everything they had need of. But
[2:01:17] they forgot to do something. And I want
[2:01:19] to read it this morning because Amen.
[2:01:23] It's very important. It's very important
[2:01:25] that we don't ever forget to do this.
[2:01:28] And this is the cause. Verse chapter
[2:01:31] verse verse four. Joshua 5:4.
[2:01:35] And this is the cause why Joshua did
[2:01:38] circumcise.
[2:01:40] So one thing they didn't do in the
[2:01:42] wilderness for 40 years is they never
[2:01:44] circumcised. They never circumcised
[2:01:49] the people.
[2:01:51] They benefited from all the blessings.
[2:01:55] They benefited from the pillar of fire.
[2:01:57] They benefited from the cloud.
[2:02:00] But they never were circumcised. And so
[2:02:03] Joshua is now using the 12 Levites, the
[2:02:07] 12 priests, and he's opening the Jordan,
[2:02:10] right? Because they're carrying the ark
[2:02:11] of the covenant. They're trying to cross
[2:02:13] into the promised land. And by faith,
[2:02:15] they're stepping into this Jordan.
[2:02:17] Waters coming apart. Amen. And here's
[2:02:19] the priest standing there as the waters
[2:02:21] are being separated. All the believers
[2:02:24] are walking in. And remember, it was the
[2:02:26] priest that was stood last until the
[2:02:28] last one walked in.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; And then they walked behind them
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; because it was the ark of the covenant
[2:02:36] that they were carrying over their
[2:02:37] hearts that mattered the way that that
[2:02:40] water was going to be able to open up
[2:02:41] and enter into the promised land. So
[2:02:43] they get into this promised land and
[2:02:44] listen and all the people that came out
[2:02:47] of Egypt that were males even all men of
[2:02:50] war died in the w died died in the
[2:02:52] wilderness by the way after they came
[2:02:54] out of Egypt. Now all the people that
[2:02:56] came out were circumcised
[2:02:59] but all the people that were born in the
[2:03:02] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[2:03:04] out of Egypt them they had not
[2:03:08] circumcised.
[2:03:14] For this, listen verse six. For the
[2:03:17] children OF ISRAEL WALKED 40 YEARS IN
[2:03:19] THE WILDERNESS, till all the people that
[2:03:22] were men of war, which came out of
[2:03:24] Egypt, were consumed, because they
[2:03:26] obeyed not the voice of the Lord, unto
[2:03:30] whom the Lord swore by he would not show
[2:03:33] them the land which the Lord swore unto
[2:03:36] their fathers, that he would give us a
[2:03:38] land that flowth with milk and honey,
[2:03:41] and the children whom he raised up in
[2:03:45] theirstead, THEM JOSHUA circumcised
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; for they were uncircumcised because they
[2:03:51] had not circumcised them by the way. And
[2:03:55] it came to pass when they had done
[2:03:57] circumcising all the people that they
[2:04:00] abode in their places in the camp till
[2:04:03] they were whole. And the Lord said to
[2:04:06] Joshua, now listen to this. This day
[2:04:11] have I rolled away
[2:04:14] the reproach of Egypt from off you.
[2:04:21] This day
[2:04:24] there had to be a day where Joshua the
[2:04:27] Holy Ghost had to recognize the heart of
[2:04:29] the believer that he was not circumcised
[2:04:32] and will come and circumcise your heart.
[2:04:35] Now listen, circumcision it's it hurts.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; The process of life hurts.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a breeze.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; It's surrendering all.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Circumcision
[2:04:53] is not a pleasant. It's not. I
[2:04:56] apologize.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; And this was the Abrahamic covenant
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; was to be circumcised. was to be cut
[2:05:04] around our heart, WAS TO BE ABLE TO LET
[2:05:07] GO OF ALL [screaming] THE THINGS THAT
[2:05:09] MIGHT WANT TO ATTACH TO US LIKE A GLUE
[2:05:11] AND BE CIRCUMCISED AROUND OUR
[2:05:13] [screaming] HEARTS.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE I DON'T WANT TO BE A
[2:05:16] PERSON WALKING THROUGH THE wilderness
[2:05:17] because remember anytime God wants to
[2:05:19] take you in the promised land, he always
[2:05:20] takes you to a wilderness experience.
[2:05:22] Jesus Christ did it. He received the
[2:05:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost. He went 40
[2:05:26] days into the wilderness. And what
[2:05:27] happened? What what was the revelation
[2:05:29] he come out of it? It says man shall not
[2:05:30] live by bread alone but shall live by
[2:05:32] every word that proceeded out of the
[2:05:34] mouth of God. At that point Jesus Christ
[2:05:36] defeated the devil.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; And the HOLY GHOST WAS NOW UNITED
[2:05:41] because nothing can deceive him. His
[2:05:44] womb and the seed now pregnant and
[2:05:46] nothing could be able to deceive him.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; And you have to be the same way
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; when that seed comes inside of you.
[2:05:52] Amen. Amen. No man, no other man seed
[2:05:55] could come inside your heart and deceive
[2:05:57] you. My brother and sister, you are not
[2:05:59] deceivable.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Your seed cannot be deceived.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; You are not deceivable,
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; but you have to stand under the present
[2:06:09] word of the hour.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; You cannot be deceived. Right? Do you
[2:06:12] believe that this morning?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that your name is written
[2:06:17] in the lamb's book of life?
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he has called you
[2:06:22] specifically for this time for you to
[2:06:24] manifest Jesus Christ?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the calling. He wants us to
[2:06:29] be like him.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; He wants us. He wants us to be like him.
[2:06:34] But this day, he rolled this reproach.
[2:06:38] My brother and sister, get circumcised
[2:06:40] around your heart.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Ask God for the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Because the the prophet said he wants to
[2:06:45] give it to you more than you want to
[2:06:47] receive it.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; But the problem is is your bless not
[2:06:50] clean
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; because remember you have to go through
[2:06:53] the process of justification,
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; sanctification.
[2:06:57] Right? Even though you were born with
[2:06:59] this nature inside of you, he has to do
[2:07:02] something to restore you. Not to bring
[2:07:04] something back or to create something
[2:07:06] new because no, he's to restore you. A a
[2:07:09] redeemer is restoring something back to
[2:07:12] where you were.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; He's not he's not change. He's not
[2:07:17] making something new. You already were
[2:07:19] what you were in the beginning. He's
[2:07:20] just restoring you to your condition.
[2:07:26] Listen to what the prophet says in
[2:07:28] identification 1964
[2:07:36] paragraph 76.
[2:07:40] No other nature. Could you give me a few
[2:07:42] more minutes?
[2:07:44] God bless you.
[2:07:46] No other nature could do this. No other
[2:07:49] nature could. No character, nothing in
[2:07:53] heavens, nothing else could do that but
[2:07:57] him.
[2:07:58] For he was the beginning of that
[2:08:01] character savior. Now I want to ask you
[2:08:05] a question.
[2:08:07] What is greater?
[2:08:09] A sinner or a savior?
[2:08:14] What is greater
[2:08:17] sickness or a healer?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; These are the these are his attributes.
[2:08:24] So he allowed these things to be so you
[2:08:26] can see his attributes
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; because you are his attributes. Jehovah
[2:08:32] Rafa, Jehovah, Jehovah. Those are the
[2:08:35] seven attributes of Jesus Christ that
[2:08:37] are living inside of you. And there's
[2:08:39] seven by the way.
[2:08:41] And they live inside of you. They
[2:08:44] restore your life. They they they
[2:08:46] regenerate your life.
[2:08:49] Savior. The angel wasn't born a savior.
[2:08:52] He was created a being to worship God,
[2:08:55] not a savior. But in God was a savior.
[2:08:59] An ordinary man born of an ordinary
[2:09:02] woman couldn't be a savior because his
[2:09:05] nature is carnal. But it taken God
[2:09:09] himself. Amen. Hope you see it. Look,
[2:09:12] that was the expression to manifest such
[2:09:15] a character as that.
[2:09:18] Hallelujah. HE WANTED TO EXPRESS THE
[2:09:20] character
[2:09:22] for others. IT WAS A FALLEN CHARACTER.
[2:09:25] Nothing can save. Angels wasn't create
[2:09:29] created for such man. Man was a fallen
[2:09:34] character.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; How could this man look to show it's the
[2:09:41] ones that he thought of? He thoughts in
[2:09:44] the Christian of today. the thoughts
[2:09:47] before the foundation of the world. Now
[2:09:50] remember, man when he was born in sin,
[2:09:52] shaped in iniquity, comes to the world
[2:09:54] speaking lies. Is that right? There is
[2:09:56] nothing in him at all. So you see if he
[2:10:00] if he was in God's thoughts when you
[2:10:03] came when you come to the world, he's
[2:10:06] come in thoughts at the beginning to
[2:10:10] display his attributes. Do you follow
[2:10:12] me? Then Jesus came to break the clouds
[2:10:16] back so that attribute could be display
[2:10:20] itself.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; He came TO MOVE THE CLOUDS back so you
[2:10:24] can SEE THE SUN. THE SUN WAS ALWAYS
[2:10:27] SITTING THERE. BUT SIN HAD NOW COVERED
[2:10:30] the sun. But he had to take away the
[2:10:32] clouds by the grace of God on Calvary.
[2:10:36] So now you can see him plainly.
[2:10:38] Hallelujah.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; In his word. His word was now no longer
[2:10:43] a man sitting in a letter, but now it
[2:10:46] was a living life. That's what came back
[2:10:48] to the disciples.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; It was a living word. It wasn't good
[2:10:51] enough that Peter and Paul, I mean,
[2:10:54] excuse me, Peter, John, and Matthew, and
[2:10:56] all the and and and and
[2:10:59] uh uh J, I believe, uh they they walked
[2:11:03] with the Lord. It wasn't it wasn't it
[2:11:06] wasn't how can I say this? Uh uh that
[2:11:09] wasn't the witnessing Jesus's Christ's
[2:11:11] ministry wasn't good enough.
[2:11:13] I mean it was good. They were able to
[2:11:15] see the son of man, but that wasn't the
[2:11:18] promise. That wasn't the inheritance.
[2:11:19] The inheritance was that I'll go and
[2:11:21] prepare a place for you that where I am,
[2:11:24] you can also be.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now when he came down, he came
[2:11:31] down into a believer's heart the same
[2:11:33] way that he was expressing HIMSELF IN
[2:11:35] JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. A
[2:11:37] MULTI-MEMBERED BODY, A BRIDE BODY THAT
[2:11:40] WOULD MANIFEST JESUS CHRIST IN THEIR
[2:11:42] TIME, IN THEIR AGE.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; I can't go live the days of Noah. I
[2:11:47] can't go back and live the days of
[2:11:48] Moses. But what I can do is fulfill the
[2:11:51] promise of this hour that God had
[2:11:53] written about me.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Because this is about fulfilling the
[2:11:57] promise of this hour. And the promise of
[2:11:59] this hour is to go in a body change.
[2:12:01] THAT IS THE PROMISE OF THIS HOUR. I WANT
[2:12:03] MY BODY TO BE CHANGED. I'M SICK AND
[2:12:05] TIRED OF THIS WORLD. THE SIN IN THIS
[2:12:07] WORLD, THE HATRED IN THIS WORLD, THE
[2:12:09] WORLD, THE WAY THE WORLD IS EXPRESSING
[2:12:10] ITSELF. THINK about it.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; SO, SO THE THEIR EXPRESSION has become
[2:12:15] so vulgar, SO OUTSPOKEN. A A SMALL
[2:12:18] PERCENTAGE of the WORLD IS CONTROLLING
[2:12:20] THE WHOLE WORLD.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; HOW? Through their vocabulary, THE WAY
[2:12:25] THAT THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES. OH MY, HOW
[2:12:27] MUCH MORE THE CHILDREN OF GOD CLAIMING
[2:12:30] THE PROMISES OF THE HOUR. AMEN.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST being the same yesterday,
[2:12:34] today, and forever. HE'S NEVER changed
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; and he'll never change.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; We change.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Today I can be on fire. Tomorrow I can
[2:12:44] but he's never changes.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; The the scripture says that he's
[2:12:47] faithful.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Faithful means he'll never let go.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll never let go of you.
[2:12:55] If he gave brother Jerob, IF HE GAVE YOU
[2:12:57] A PROMISE, HE'LL NEVER LET GO OF YOU.
[2:12:59] BROTHER EMANUEL, if he EVER GAVE YOU A
[2:13:01] PROMISE, HE'LL NEVER LET GO OF YOU.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, YOU GOT TO BE SAFE IN
[2:13:05] HIS ARMS.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE SAFE KNOWING THAT HE'S in
[2:13:09] control.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; God don't need man control.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; God don't need man control. That's
[2:13:18] communism.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; I apologize. God, we need the Holy
[2:13:23] Ghost.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; To get into the promised land, you need
[2:13:26] the Holy Ghost.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[2:13:29] And the Holy Ghost is a new life.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; It's no longer you.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost,
[2:13:42] I cannot say I have the Holy Ghost and
[2:13:44] go do all these things that may seem
[2:13:47] okay today. I I'm sorry
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; because light and darkness will never be
[2:13:53] able to stay together.
[2:13:55] And the prophet would say, I I I I don't
[2:13:58] know, I believe it was in leadership or
[2:14:00] one of the services. He says, you can
[2:14:02] have the Holy Ghost all your life.
[2:14:05] I I'm sorry. I'm just repeating the
[2:14:07] words of the prophet. Let it let the
[2:14:08] Holy Ghost interpret this to your own
[2:14:10] heart. You can have the Holy Ghost all
[2:14:13] of your life and still be lost and go to
[2:14:15] hell.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; If the seed is not in you,
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want the seed of God in our
[2:14:24] life. We want the word of God in our
[2:14:25] life. We want the word of God to be the
[2:14:28] the absolute in my life and your life.
[2:14:30] Amen. That's my desire this morning.
[2:14:32] Amen. For the Holy Ghost to LEAD US AND
[2:14:34] GUIDE US INTO TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[2:14:37] HALLELUJAH. I GOT TO BE A DOUBLE A
[2:14:39] DOUBLE- WINGED EAGLE. I cannot just fly
[2:14:40] with one. I have to have both my wings.
[2:14:43] If not, I'll just be flapping and I'll
[2:14:44] get tired and before I know it, I'm
[2:14:46] going to break my right wing. But he
[2:14:48] gave us two wings. Amen. So you CAN SOAR
[2:14:50] IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS. And
[2:14:53] if YOU THINK YOU'RE AN OLD EAGLE,
[2:14:55] REMEMBER THERE'S A PLACE OF REGENERATION
[2:14:57] EVEN FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO? GO INTO THE
[2:15:01] WILDERNESS. Spend a few days up there.
[2:15:04] Knock your beak against the rock and
[2:15:06] you'll get a new beak. YOU'LL GET NEW
[2:15:07] FEATHERS. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A YOU BECOME A NEW EAGLE.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE ATTRIBUTE THE
[2:15:16] GENE INSIDE THIS EAGLE WAS TO BE ABLE TO
[2:15:19] REGENERATE.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's right.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; You can go up there, you pluck all your
[2:15:24] all your little things out of you.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; You just become a little skinless, you
[2:15:28] know,
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; bird.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, am I even worthy? What's about me?
[2:15:35] Is it Is it really him?
[2:15:38] What What's going on? And all of a
[2:15:40] sudden, you see your feathers just start
[2:15:42] growing.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; But you're keep you keep worrying. But
[2:15:45] he's growing on you. And he's growing on
[2:15:47] you. And he's growing on you. And he's
[2:15:49] growing on you. And the feathers are
[2:15:50] coming out. And your eagle. And now your
[2:15:52] claws are starting to become strong. And
[2:15:54] your beak is now being regenerated. Your
[2:15:57] eyesight is no longer a bad eyesight.
[2:15:59] Your eyesight now becomes a 2020
[2:16:01] eyesight. Hallelujah. And once you come
[2:16:03] to your regeneration, what's the first
[2:16:05] thing YOU DO? YOU FLY, MY BROTHER.
[2:16:08] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU ARE CREATED TO
[2:16:10] BE OUT OF THIS WORLD, NOT IN THIS WORLD.
[2:16:14] SO HIGH THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE SIN
[2:16:16] OF THIS WORLD.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; WHERE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN EFFECT ON
[2:16:20] YOUR LIFE.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO BE that way. WE HAVE TO LET
[2:16:24] GO OF THE THINGS OF THE WORLD AND CHOOSE
[2:16:27] Jesus Christ every moment of your life.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; He can help you in school.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; He can help you in school.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; I He helped me in school. However many
[2:16:39] classes I was able to do because I
[2:16:41] didn't I didn't like to read. I didn't
[2:16:42] like to study. And so Lord, are you
[2:16:45] going to help me take this test?
[2:16:47] F.
[2:16:50] You were too confident.
[2:16:54] You should have read some.
[2:16:57] Think about it. The flesh. But when you
[2:17:00] depended on him, Lord, I don't know. You
[2:17:03] know, you know what I need.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Now it comes a sincere heart.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Now it's no longer a show. Now is no
[2:17:11] longer a put on. Now it's you and God's
[2:17:14] sincerity. Lord, you know me. You know
[2:17:16] my vessel. You know what I can do. You
[2:17:18] know what I can't do. But I CAN'T DO
[2:17:20] THIS WITHOUT YOU.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I NEED YOU TO DO THIS FOR ME.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; And you'll see him come upon your life.
[2:17:27] And you'll SEE HIM COME MANIFEST HIMSELF
[2:17:29] IN YOUR LIFE. AND YOU'LL SAY, "OH, DAVE,
[2:17:30] you've been there all along."
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have to concentrate my
[2:17:34] vision back on you. Absolutely.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; I just have to concentrate my vision
[2:17:39] just right on you because there's so
[2:17:41] much distraction. I don't want to walk
[2:17:43] in this wilderness and not be
[2:17:44] circumcised.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; I want to be circumcised in the name of
[2:17:47] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; because that's what will save you.
[2:17:50] That's the token.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; It's the token to make it to the other
[2:17:54] side. He's God expressed. He is God's
[2:17:59] expressed word. Nothing else could be
[2:18:02] manifested.
[2:18:03] The characters all had fallen. Then you
[2:18:07] see what did Jesus come to bring back
[2:18:10] those characters? No. No. They were born
[2:18:13] in sin shaped in iniquity. He came as a
[2:18:16] redeemer. Paragraph 78. And to redeem
[2:18:19] anything is TO BRING IT BACK.
[2:18:21] HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; So the only ones THAT COULD BE BROUGHT
[2:18:25] BACK IS THE ONES THAT WERE THERE IN THE
[2:18:26] BEGINNING. HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; So you WERE THERE IN THE BEGINNING.
[2:18:30] AMEN. Bring it back. IT WAS GOD'S
[2:18:33] THOUGHT. YOU THINK little you, little
[2:18:36] me, no one in the world could take MY
[2:18:38] PLACE. NO ONE CAN take yours.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; You being a Christian and filled with
[2:18:44] the spirit. God and before the
[2:18:46] foundation of the world seen you and
[2:18:48] knowed every feature that you got. See,
[2:18:52] and Jesus come to bring you back.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; That was the inheritance.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Okay, I have seed. I I planted this
[2:19:02] whole ground that have seed.
[2:19:04] Should we pluck them up yet, Lord? No.
[2:19:05] No. No. No. No. No. No. Let them grow
[2:19:07] together. Let them grow together.
[2:19:10] Because if you pluck them up now, you'll
[2:19:12] pluck away my good seed.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; So, let them grow together. Just keep
[2:19:18] water in the ground. Just keep give keep
[2:19:21] giving them life.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; And so, they grew and they grew and they
[2:19:25] grew and they grew. And all of a sudden
[2:19:28] we come through through the through the
[2:19:32] leaf of the fruit and we we get through
[2:19:34] the body of the of the plant and all of
[2:19:36] a sudden we come to the shuck and we
[2:19:37] come to the seed. Now I want to ask you
[2:19:39] a question and I and I I want I I want
[2:19:42] you to to put it personal. What's more
[2:19:46] important,
[2:19:48] the shock or the seed?
[2:19:52] This flesh
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; or the word of God?
[2:19:58] What do you do with the shuck?
[2:20:00] If I was to have a piece of corn, right,
[2:20:03] and then you have the shuck on top of a
[2:20:04] corn, for me to enjoy the corn, I would
[2:20:07] have to pull away the shuck. I mean, you
[2:20:09] can throw it away. You can burn it. You
[2:20:10] can do whatever you want with it, but
[2:20:12] that's the shuck.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; It has no has no use.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; It's already done its purpose. It's the
[2:20:19] past.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; But the whole purpose was to mature the
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; seed.
[2:20:26] And we're living in the days of the
[2:20:28] seed. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; We've moved UP INTO THE OPENING OF THE
[2:20:33] WORD.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NO LONGER IN THE SHOCK. NOW WE'RE
[2:20:36] IN THE SEED.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN 63.
[2:20:40] THAT'S WHAT GOD DID IN ON MOUNT
[2:20:42] TRANSFIGURATION FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM. HE
[2:20:44] CAME AND HE OPENED THE BOOK. AND NOW THE
[2:20:46] BOOK WAS CALLING THE SEED. [screaming]
[2:20:47] PRAISE THE LORD.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; HE WAS CALLING YOU OUT OF DARKNESS.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; HE WAS CALLING YOU OUT OF SIN. HE WAS
[2:20:53] CALLING YOU OUT OF BONDAGE. IT WAS THIS
[2:20:55] MESSAGE THAT WAS CALLING YOU FROM YOUR
[2:20:57] CONDITION TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW. IT WAS
[2:20:59] THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET. IT WAS THE
[2:21:01] TRUMP.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T LOSE THE focus because
[2:21:04] you have to keep the main thing. The
[2:21:06] main thing and the main thing of this
[2:21:08] hour is this message that will change
[2:21:09] you, my brother AND SISTER. THERE'S
[2:21:11] NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE THAT
[2:21:12] WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU RAPTURING
[2:21:14] FAITH.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS RAPTURING FAITH.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS JESUS CHRIST.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU WANT TO GET TO KNOW JESUS
[2:21:24] CHRIST? Get in the message.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Do you want the Holy Ghost?
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Eat the message.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be healed?
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; EAT THE MESSAGE.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE MESSAGE DO? It gives you
[2:21:40] authority over the devil.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE IT WAS INSPIRED BY A
[2:21:45] PROPHET.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU RECEIVE A PROPHET IN THE NAME
[2:21:48] OF A PROPHET,
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL RECEIVE A PROPHET'S REWARD.
[2:21:51] HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:52] HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; It's a reward. It's your inheritance.
[2:21:55] It's you.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; It's you that Jesus Christ died for.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOU THAT HE CALLED. It's you that
[2:22:03] he elected. IT WAS YOU HE GAVE HIS LIFE
[2:22:06] FOR.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; It was you,
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; not somebody else.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't you, you wouldn't be here
[2:22:14] this morning.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; But because he was you,
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; he called you
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; and he elected you.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because arise and shine that
[2:22:23] light has come.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; It's upon you.
[2:22:28] Remember
[2:22:29] the vision of the tent.
[2:22:35] That vision had a few instances in there
[2:22:37] that so 1956 the prophet talks about the
[2:22:41] vision of the tent. It was the first
[2:22:42] time that the Lord gave it to him and he
[2:22:44] doesn't actually fulfill till 1963 which
[2:22:46] is seven years later. And so he he he
[2:22:50] he's showing them the fishing how
[2:22:52] remember you cannot teach Pentecostal
[2:22:54] baby supernatural things and he's
[2:22:56] showing them how to fish and he says
[2:22:58] that as he was has he he was in there
[2:23:00] fishing he was teaching them how to fish
[2:23:02] the first pool and the second pool and
[2:23:05] in the second pool he was saying to him
[2:23:06] hey when you fish this time he says
[2:23:08] you'll see you'll throw you'll throw
[2:23:10] your your fishing pole in your
[2:23:14] your lure thank you very much your lure
[2:23:17] you're going to throw your lure in the
[2:23:18] water. But you you understand, you just
[2:23:20] have to pull it really slowly. But
[2:23:21] listen, he says, as they're getting
[2:23:24] closer to the to the lure and they're
[2:23:26] wanting to eat, pull it a little harder
[2:23:28] so you can disturb the little fishes
[2:23:30] because it was the little fishes that
[2:23:32] was trying to eat, but I'm wanting to c
[2:23:35] he was wanting to catch a big fish. So
[2:23:36] the Lord is teaching him all this and
[2:23:38] this vision. And all of a sudden, he he
[2:23:41] gets caught up and he sees a vision of
[2:23:42] the tent. How many How many of you
[2:23:44] remember this?
[2:23:45] So he sees the vision a picture of the
[2:23:47] big tent. This you know this this the
[2:23:50] vision of the prophet contained of
[2:23:52] multiple things. And so he sees the
[2:23:54] vision of of a big tent. So all of a
[2:23:56] sudden he's like well maybe this is
[2:23:58] something that I have I have to go to
[2:23:59] Mexico and I have to go put these big
[2:24:01] tents and preach the gospel. Maybe the
[2:24:03] Lord's doing something. This is the
[2:24:04] prophet himself saying all this. And so
[2:24:07] uh uh then all of a sudden he he's
[2:24:10] talking about how the Lord was wanting
[2:24:12] them to to catch the big fish. Right?
[2:24:14] Remember the rainbow trout,
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Because this was the third pool. And it
[2:24:18] says, "Hey, in this third pool, don't
[2:24:20] pull so hard.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; You've already you've already got
[2:24:24] impersonators that are your first and
[2:24:25] second pool."
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; So many impersonators in healings and
[2:24:29] all of these things that were happening.
[2:24:30] So many impersonators. But on this third
[2:24:33] pool, don't pull hard because this is
[2:24:36] only for the elect.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; This is going to be a secret.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. Yeah,
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; this is going to be a secret. And then
[2:24:46] the Lord shows him this tent. And this
[2:24:48] tent, he says he was standing and the
[2:24:50] angel was standing right behind him and
[2:24:52] he's sitting he's sitting next to the
[2:24:54] tent. And he says, "I've I' I've noticed
[2:24:56] that all of a sudden the light that was
[2:24:59] upon me, now catch this. The light that
[2:25:01] was upon me now was no longer on me, but
[2:25:03] it was upon the tent. It was inside the
[2:25:05] tent."
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, there's a difference
[2:25:08] between the light and the angel." if if
[2:25:10] you can catch it because because now now
[2:25:14] the light was upon inside the tent and
[2:25:17] he says, "I'll meet you in there."
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; And there was a there was a woman that
[2:25:22] was on cur curt crutches
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; and she was sick and she she was wanting
[2:25:26] to get inside the room. Amen. And there
[2:25:28] was there there was a man there that was
[2:25:30] was telling everybody says, "Let's be
[2:25:32] reverent because there's a prayer line,
[2:25:34] right? People had a prayer line." I'm
[2:25:35] just describing to you briefly of of the
[2:25:38] vision of the prophet. But it says when
[2:25:40] that woman walked inside that tent, when
[2:25:42] she came on the other side, she was
[2:25:44] healed.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT MAN WALKED INSIDE THAT TENT,
[2:25:49] WHEN HE WALKED OUT, HE was healed.
[2:25:53] So what happened in the tent?
[2:25:57] He discerned their situation, provided
[2:25:59] the deliverance, provided the word for
[2:26:02] their hour, and that was the intimate
[2:26:04] place that God called you to be in.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Because it's not for it's not a public
[2:26:10] show.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; It's an intimate relationship between
[2:26:13] the wife and the husband.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Now, it's between you and the Lord Jesus
[2:26:19] Christ.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; The mystery of his will. This is the
[2:26:23] inheritance that he had for you. If I
[2:26:25] can invite the musicians to come. If you
[2:26:27] have Ephesians, this is where the Lord
[2:26:30] inspire inspired me here. Ephesians
[2:26:32] chapter 1 verse one.
[2:26:38] The mystery of his will. He's called you
[2:26:40] for a purpose. He's called you. Amen.
[2:26:45] He's called you. Amen. With the with the
[2:26:47] vision because you have to have a
[2:26:49] vision.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a vision, you'll
[2:26:51] perish.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; You have to have a vision.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have God has to be your
[2:26:55] vision. Amen. And he's called you in
[2:26:59] this age because you are supposed to be
[2:27:02] the light of this age. And how can I be
[2:27:04] light, brother Cosman? How how is it
[2:27:07] that I can be light? What is it that I
[2:27:09] can do that I can become this light?
[2:27:11] Maybe it's so hard for me to put these
[2:27:13] things together. You know the scripture
[2:27:15] says if we walk in the light as he is in
[2:27:20] the light,
[2:27:22] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you
[2:27:24] from all unbelief.
[2:27:26] Amen.
[2:27:28] And and and and then you'll have

[2:27:32] So walk in the light he as he is in the
[2:27:34] light. Amen. And then the blood of Jesus
[2:27:37] Christ shall cleanse you from all
[2:27:40] unbelief
[2:27:41] when you stay with the light. Paul, an
[2:27:44] apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of
[2:27:46] God, to the saints which are at Ephesus,
[2:27:49] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.

[2:27:54] father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:27:58] Verse three, blessed be God and father
[2:28:03] of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed
[2:28:05] us all with all spiritual blessings in
[2:28:08] heavenly places in Christ. Now listen to
[2:28:10] verse four. according as he had chosen
[2:28:14] us in him before the foundation of the
[2:28:17] world that we should be.
[2:28:22] How should you be?
[2:28:25] and without blame before him in love,
[2:28:32] having predestinated us unto the
[2:28:35] adoption of children
[2:28:38] by Jesus Christ to himself
[2:28:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[2:28:46] will.
[2:28:52] God is not annoyed with you.
[2:28:55] God doesn't get annoyed. He has a
[2:28:58] pleasure
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; in saving you.
[2:29:03] Think about it. He desires.
[2:29:07] He wants to.
[2:29:09] He longs for you
[2:29:12] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[2:29:15] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[2:29:19] beloved in whom he have redemption
[2:29:21] through his blood the forgiveness of sin
[2:29:23] according to the riches of his grace
[2:29:25] wherein he had abounded towards us in
[2:29:28] all wisdom and prudence having made
[2:29:30] known unto us the mystery of his will.
[2:29:37] having made unto you the his the mystery
[2:29:39] of his will according to his good
[2:29:42] pleasure which he had purposed in
[2:29:45] himself
[2:29:47] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[2:29:50] of times he might gather together in all
[2:29:53] in one hallelujah all things in Christ
[2:29:58] hallelujah
[2:30:00] both which are in heaven and which are
[2:30:02] on earth even in him in whom also we
[2:30:06] have obtained an inheritance, being
[2:30:09] predestinated according to the purpose
[2:30:11] of him who workketh all things after the
[2:30:13] counsel of his own will, that we should
[2:30:16] be to the pray that that we should be to
[2:30:18] the praise of his glory, who first
[2:30:21] trusted in Christ, in whom ye also
[2:30:23] trusted that after ye heard the word of
[2:30:26] truth, the gospel of your salvation, in
[2:30:29] whom also after that ye believed,
[2:30:33] ye were sealed
[2:30:35] with that hol Holy Spirit of promise.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:30:45] promise that G that was for you [music]
[2:30:48] which is the earnest hallelujah
[2:30:50] of our inheritance until the redemption
[2:30:54] of the purchased possession unto the
[2:30:58] praise of his glory. Hallelujah. For him
[2:31:01] to redeem what he purchased. Now I'll
[2:31:04] tell you this.
[2:31:05] When he purchased you, he didn't
[2:31:07] purchase you halfway.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I'm gonna give a 50 50%
[2:31:13] deposit and then later on I'm going to
[2:31:16] give another 50% deposit."
[2:31:18] He didn't do it that way. When he
[2:31:20] redeemed you, he redeemed you whole.
[2:31:22] Hallelujah.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; He redeemed all of you.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED EVERYTHING INSIDE OF YOU.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED YOU all
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; because he came TO REDEEM A CHARACTER,
[2:31:34] MY BRIDE. AMEN. THIS IS YOU. THIS IS ALL
[2:31:37] ABOUT YOU.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT GOD IS DOING IN
[2:31:41] YOUR LIFE.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT YOUR TESTIMONY.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT YOUR VOICE BECAUSE YOU'RE
[2:31:46] THE LAST VOICE IN THIS LAST AGE.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT YOU. YOU HAVE TO TESTIFY
[2:31:53] OF THIS GOODNESS OF GOD. AMEN.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; If people can testify about their
[2:31:58] religion and how big their their parties
[2:32:01] are, so how big how big their services
[2:32:03] are, how much more we about the name of
[2:32:06] Jesus Christ in this generation.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we have a fountain
[2:32:10] full of water. We have a table full of
[2:32:12] food that you could eat at. Amen. God
[2:32:16] chose sons and daughters of God. And you
[2:32:20] know, nature
[2:32:22] is groaning.
[2:32:25] Okay. Nature's groaning
[2:32:28] for your manifestation.
[2:32:32] Nature is groaning for you to come to
[2:32:35] maturity
[2:32:37] because that's what called had what
[2:32:39] that's what God had called [music] a
[2:32:41] bride not only filled with the Holy
[2:32:43] Ghost but mature bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:32:48] Amen. God bless you. Let's just stand.
[2:32:56] If you haven't read your will,
[2:32:59] I want to inspire you this morning to go
[2:33:03] and go receive your will this morning
[2:33:06] because it was the inheritance is yours.
[2:33:09] God given you the the land. The land is
[2:33:11] yours. [music] Amen. The land is yours.
[2:33:14] The land was given to the overcomer. If
[2:33:17] you Revelation says, Amen. that to him
[2:33:21] that overcomemeth will I let or grant to
[2:33:26] sit with me on my throne even as I
[2:33:29] overcame Jesus Christ himself and sat
[2:33:31] with the father on the throne and god
[2:33:33] doesn't have a chair like a throne where
[2:33:35] he sits in heaven that's not that's not
[2:33:37] the that's not the throne
[2:33:41] his throne is dominion that's what he
[2:33:44] that's what was in the beginning and I'm
[2:33:46] not God has not restored us going back
[2:33:49] to Pentecost [music] I apologize Guys,
[2:33:51] you know where God has restored us to go
[2:33:53] back to? Back into the garden of Eden
[2:33:55] where the lamb and the lion can sit
[2:33:57] together.
[2:33:58] You know, Daniel, he was he he he he
[2:34:01] caught the mark of the beast. So here's
[2:34:04] Daniel, a prophet that made an image
[2:34:06] unto Daniel. They were worshiping
[2:34:08] Daniel. They couldn't find nothing
[2:34:09] against Daniel, right? And Daniel is a
[2:34:11] type of revelation. That's what the
[2:34:13] prophet says. [music] And so here's
[2:34:15] Daniel. They couldn't find nothing in
[2:34:17] Daniel. So what did they do? They came
[2:34:19] against his doctrine. Oh, well, we're
[2:34:20] going to write he's he's a righteous
[2:34:22] man. We have nothing to say about him.
[2:34:24] So now we're going to come against his
[2:34:26] doctrine. If you don't worship with this
[2:34:30] creature here,
[2:34:33] we're going to persecute you.
[2:34:36] Think about it. Because a time is coming
[2:34:37] where they're trying to have control. I
[2:34:40] don't know about here, but in Romania,
[2:34:42] it's starting to. They're wanting to
[2:34:44] have control. They're putting they're
[2:34:46] putting it publicly out there that if
[2:34:48] they hearing if they're hearing people
[2:34:50] amen marrying homosexual couples in
[2:34:53] their church or doing all these things
[2:34:55] there too, preaching about amen,
[2:34:57] preaching about politics or doing all
[2:34:58] these things, they have the right to
[2:35:00] come and close down your church. So the
[2:35:02] pressure is coming where it's now
[2:35:04] putting you to a test.
[2:35:07] You have to have that rapturing faith,
[2:35:08] my brother and sister. That's what he
[2:35:10] called us to be. And so Daniel, think
[2:35:13] about it. Because he didn't bow down to
[2:35:15] that God. He had the Holy Ghost. THE
[2:35:18] WORD WAS INSIDE of him. HE DIDN'T BOW
[2:35:20] DOWN TO THAT IMAGE. What did he do? They
[2:35:22] put him into a cage. They put him into a
[2:35:24] big hole, right? They put him into into
[2:35:28] this big place where he can be eaten by
[2:35:30] all these lions. But Daniel
[2:35:34] had dominion.
[2:35:36] He knew that God would save him.
[2:35:39] He knew that what was inside of him, the
[2:35:41] divine love. Now think about it because
[2:35:44] those those those lions didn't even feel
[2:35:47] hunger around Daniel. The presence of
[2:35:50] Daniel was so heavy inside that place
[2:35:52] that he had control over the lamb, over
[2:35:55] the lion. Hallelujah. It was that divine
[2:35:58] love. Let me tell you something. The
[2:36:00] prophet did the same thing, my brother
[2:36:01] and sister. He he bothered the bull.
[2:36:08] He restored Eden.
[2:36:10] He bothered a wops wops nest.
[2:36:15] He restored Eden.
[2:36:17] Amen. It was perfect love in the
[2:36:19] beginning. It was perfect love. It was
[2:36:22] it was a perfect world that God had
[2:36:24] created. Amen. And what happened? Daniel
[2:36:28] overcame because the angels was there
[2:36:30] with him.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; The love of God. You see what divine
[2:36:34] love.
[2:36:36] Amen. And divine love is blind. Divine
[2:36:38] love covers the multitude of sin. Divine
[2:36:41] love is God himself.
[2:36:44] And that's what he created you to be,
[2:36:46] divine love. Let's just bow our heads
[2:36:47] this [music] morning.
[2:36:50] Father, we
[2:36:52] so appreciate you this morning for your
[2:36:55] goodness.
[2:36:57] Oh, Father, I I
[2:37:01] I've only said what you've allowed me to
[2:37:02] say.
[2:37:04] I appreciate Lord that you were able to
[2:37:07] encourage us this morning, especially
[2:37:09] myself, knowing Lord that the will is
[2:37:13] the inheritance.
[2:37:14] And Father, you didn't call us to be
[2:37:16] bums in this world. [music] You didn't
[2:37:18] call us to beg for bread in this world.
[2:37:20] Father, Lord, you called us sons and
[2:37:23] daughters of God. You created us out of
[2:37:26] your own DNA. [music] You gave us Lord
[2:37:29] the most powerful tool that we can use
[2:37:31] and that's your word where we can
[2:37:33] overcome in a deceitful evil age.
[2:37:35] Father, oh Father, may you be able to
[2:37:37] quicken our hearts this morning. Oh
[2:37:40] Lord, I pray in the name of the Lord
[2:37:41] Jesus Christ that oh my heart would be
[2:37:44] able to be full of joy and full of
[2:37:45] revelation, full of your truth, Father,
[2:37:48] full of of of of
[2:37:51] happiness, Lord. So when we leave this
[2:37:54] place, we know our calling and election
[2:37:56] and you've called us properly. Father, I
[2:37:59] pray that you bless your bride this
[2:38:00] morning. Father, I pray that you as they
[2:38:04] Lord, as we depart and go home and Lord,
[2:38:06] we go to our places, may your word just
[2:38:09] be able to rum rumigate or Lord, just be
[2:38:11] able to uh sit there and [music] just go
[2:38:14] through our minds and and quicken our
[2:38:16] hearts, Lord. Let it just be able to
[2:38:18] take root into our hearts and and put
[2:38:20] our lives, Lord, into the filter of this
[2:38:22] word and say, Lord, where am I with you
[2:38:25] today? What is my relationship with with
[2:38:27] you today? Oh Lord, and I want to tell
[2:38:29] you this morning, I want to get closer
[2:38:31] to you even this morning, Father,
[2:38:33] because you're eternal. You can never
[2:38:34] end, oh Lord, I can never have too much
[2:38:37] of you. Hallelujah. I can never have too
[2:38:39] much of you. I can never get too tired
[2:38:41] of you because you're eternal. Oh, and
[2:38:43] every time you discover yourself, every
[2:38:44] time you reveal yourself, it's always in
[2:38:47] love. And we appreciate that this
[2:38:48] morning, Father. Oh, Lord, we thank you
[2:38:50] for this opportunity I had this morning
[2:38:52] just to [music]
[2:38:53] Lord be here with the believers of
[2:38:55] Christian Life Tabernacle. May you
[2:38:57] continue to bless this sanctuary. May
[2:38:59] you believe, Lord, may you be able to
[2:39:01] bless the the bride of Christian Life
[2:39:03] Tabernacle. May you lead them, guide
[2:39:05] them, strengthen them, Lord Jesus. Unite
[2:39:07] them in this chain of love, Lord. Oh,
[2:39:09] may they be able to grow together, oh
[2:39:12] Lord, and and just get ripen under your
[2:39:14] son, Lord, because we are we are close
[2:39:17] that we are our time is close where you
[2:39:20] you're coming to take away a bribe. And
[2:39:22] that's my hope. That's my that's my
[2:39:24] faith, Lord Jesus, that one day two will
[2:39:26] be in the bed. You'll take one, you'll
[2:39:29] leave one. Two will be on the field,
[2:39:31] you'll take one, you'll leave one. Oh
[2:39:33] Lord, let us just be able to be ready
[2:39:36] like the working bride. Lord, that
[2:39:38] worked for you, Lord Jesus. We know that
[2:39:40] the prophet talks about it. All the
[2:39:42] sister denominationals were just getting
[2:39:44] pretty, oh Lord, and they were just
[2:39:46] trying to get ready for the king and and
[2:39:48] just thinking that this this is going to
[2:39:50] be them that oh Lord, that they they may
[2:39:53] inherit this, but no, you had a bride
[2:39:55] that was serving you day and night,
[2:39:57] Lord. And that's the one that he seen
[2:40:00] the character in her and he called her
[2:40:02] to be her wife. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, may
[2:40:05] our life be worthy of this gospel. We
[2:40:09] love you this morning. We appreciate
[2:40:11] you, Father. And we just commit Lord
[2:40:14] our lives in your hands. In the name of
[2:40:17] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[2:40:20] Amen. Let's just sing this song as

[2:42:43] the world.
[2:42:46] Hallelujah.
[2:42:48] Amen. How many enjoy the word this
[2:42:50] morning?
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; I I just want to ask you to just take a
[2:42:53] moment for what was spoken this morning
[2:42:56] and and just consider yourself and the
[2:42:59] mystery of his will as we heard. It's
[2:43:01] it's such a dark time as we heard and
[2:43:04] and but God yet God has made his word
[2:43:06] known unto us and and the question we
[2:43:09] have to ask ourselves is am I living at
[2:43:11] the potential of what's been made known
[2:43:13] unto me? He he's called me to be a son
[2:43:16] and a daughter and and he died for me so
[2:43:19] my sins could be taken away. Am I living
[2:43:22] by the provision that he's made for me?
[2:43:24] [music] We have an inheritance.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; And and and I think we we struggle in
[2:43:29] the world. We have all of these things
[2:43:31] going on. But the question is, are you
[2:43:34] living by the inheritance that is left
[2:43:36] for you? Don't let just just say, "Well,
[2:43:39] that was a good service. That was a good
[2:43:41] message." And go out and another
[2:43:43] service. The time is late. As we heard
[2:43:46] it, you know, we we it's not a guarantee
[2:43:50] that day in and day out we'll come and
[2:43:52] have another service and go home. And
[2:43:54] no, we we want to be ready. If this was
[2:43:58] my last service, I want to make sure I'm
[2:44:00] ready.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; I'm ready. I I I'm prepared and and the
[2:44:04] word of God is working in my heart and I
[2:44:06] have the Holy Spirit working in me. I I
[2:44:09] love what Alberto said. Bur says the
[2:44:12] Holy Spirit, it says the new birth is
[2:44:15] that personal revelation to you when you
[2:44:18] and him become one.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; Let's not just be another service. We we
[2:44:25] running out of time and we we want to we
[2:44:28] coming to the end and and if the word
[2:44:30] was sent to give us rapturing faith, we
[2:44:33] want to make sure we have rapturing
[2:44:34] faith today, not tomorrow, this service,
[2:44:38] this morning. God, I need that rapturing
[2:44:41] faith. And God, my life is not right. I
[2:44:43] want my life to be right today. Father,
[2:44:46] I'm struggling with this. I want you to
[2:44:48] help me with that today. Uh we we keep
[2:44:50] postponing. And that's, let me say this,
[2:44:52] that's the enemy that's doing that. Oh
[2:44:55] yeah, maybe tomorrow I'll get better.
[2:44:57] MAYBE. NO, THERE'S NO TOMORROW. THERE'S
[2:45:00] NO GUARANTEE FOR TOMORROW. All we got is
[2:45:03] this morning is today. And my question
[2:45:06] to us this morning is the word working
[2:45:09] and producing what is supposed to
[2:45:11] produce in me?
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; We heard it in the Exodus. He provided a
[2:45:17] way and and they had the the food and
[2:45:19] THEY SAW SO MUCH supernatural
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; until it just became common.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SUPERNATURAL, SO MUCH WORD. AND
[2:45:29] and and the the same people, God looked
[2:45:32] at them and they said, "This will not
[2:45:34] inherit."
[2:45:36] They had to die in the wilderness.
[2:45:38] Another group had to come up so they can
[2:45:40] cross over. all of that because they
[2:45:43] failed to realize it was the grace of
[2:45:45] God that was walking them through.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; But Ram says we are invited. He was the
[2:45:51] only CHARACTER THAT COULD DO IT.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; We just read it and he says we are
[2:45:56] invited to shape our character to his.
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; Are we shaping our character?
[2:46:06] Is the word having any effect on us at
[2:46:09] all?
[2:46:10] It it's just this a good sermon that we
[2:46:13] take notes and we go and we keep it
[2:46:15] where we put our notes at.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; It's just it's just as a good subject to
[2:46:20] go and study and find out.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; It's got to become life.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; It's got to [music] change our walk.
[2:46:29] It's got to change our attitude. It's
[2:46:32] got to have an effect on us. It's got to
[2:46:34] change the way we look, the way we talk.
[2:46:37] If if Christ is manifested again, it's
[2:46:41] the same life. It's not a different
[2:46:43] life. IT WOULD SHOW THE SAME
[2:46:44] MANIFESTATION
[2:46:46] BY THE SAME FRUIT.
[2:46:49] And if we not, he's inviting us this
[2:46:51] morning is for us to say, "Father, I
[2:46:55] this is the greatest message that's ever
[2:46:57] touched the face of the earth. And and
[2:47:00] my desire this morning is by your grace,
[2:47:02] not by my strength, not by MY WILL, NOT
[2:47:05] BY ANYTHING I can offer. Let it be by
[2:47:07] your grace this morning that that word
[2:47:11] may become a reality in my life. If if
[2:47:14] you open my eyes to see this, if you you
[2:47:18] open my eyes for me to know and see this
[2:47:20] things, there's got to be a way for me
[2:47:23] to become what I see.
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; I just don't want to see it and not
[2:47:27] become it.
[2:47:28] I
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is the hour of the
[2:47:30] falling away.
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; This is the hour where
[2:47:35] instead of life being drawn, it's the
[2:47:38] word that stays in the water and it's
[2:47:41] rotting where life is around it.
[2:47:44] And and we got to be careful. We got to
[2:47:46] look and we got to shake ourselves. We
[2:47:49] got to make sure that [music] whatever
[2:47:50] is happening that we are being affected
[2:47:53] by the word of God. It's [music]
[2:47:55] changing us day by day. our fellowship
[2:47:58] with him is growing. Not our fellowship
[2:48:00] with the pastor, not our fellowshipping
[2:48:02] with the church and everybody else and
[2:48:04] all that. That's wonderful. But the
[2:48:06] fellowship with him
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; is your love growing in my heart. A am I
[2:48:14] desiring this? Is the life changing in
[2:48:17] me? Am I growing? Am I coming [music]
[2:48:20] into that image of that perfect son that
[2:48:22] we heard which was Jesus Christ? you
[2:48:25] yourself manifested in the flesh. If
[2:48:27] that's your heart desire, why don't you
[2:48:29] just lift your hand after him and and if
[2:48:31] you need prayer this morning, just come
[2:48:33] and you'll be prayed for. I I I just my
[2:48:36] heart is just swelling up because we
[2:48:39] hear this and I'm like, am I hearing too
[2:48:42] much of this where it's becoming common?
[2:48:44] If it is, Lord, help me this morning.
[2:48:48] But Father, I I I don't want to walk out
[2:48:50] the same way I came in. And and and I
[2:48:53] just want something to happen in my
[2:48:56] life, Lord, that your Holy Spirit will
[2:48:58] quicken what we just heard that we know
[2:49:01] it's a reality that we can go out there
[2:49:04] not just to people with the knowledge in
[2:49:06] the head, but we become people with the
[2:49:08] life being put on display.
[2:49:11] Help us, Lord, this morning. And our
[2:49:13] gracious father, we're so thankful for
[2:49:15] your word that was spoken. Lord Jesus,
[2:49:18] you haven't changed you the same
[2:49:20] yesterday, today, and forever. Father,
[2:49:22] if we heard your word this morning and
[2:49:24] that which is calling us to be perfect
[2:49:26] as our father in heaven is perfect.
[2:49:29] Lord, you couldn't call unless you
[2:49:30] provided a way for perfection. Lord, if
[2:49:33] you called us to be sons and daughters
[2:49:35] manifesting the word, you couldn't call
[2:49:38] us unless you're manifesting, [music]
[2:49:40] you going to manifest that which you
[2:49:42] called us for. Lord, help us learn to be
[2:49:44] prisoners to you, oh God. And father,
[2:49:47] help us to forget about ourselves and
[2:49:49] and what we got, our programs. And it
[2:49:52] didn't go this way. It didn't go that
[2:49:53] way. But Father, that we may cling only
[2:49:56] to you through your word and let it feed
[2:49:59] us and and that we may become that which
[2:50:01] you have spoken, Lord. And Father, that
[2:50:04] we may never fail to understand that
[2:50:06] each way, each time we step in this
[2:50:09] building is an opportunity for a change
[2:50:11] of life. and and and that you are here
[2:50:14] making your word a reality and and
[2:50:16] Father speaking to us that we can get
[2:50:19] ready for the for the for the rapture
[2:50:21] that is around the corner. FATHER, LET
[2:50:23] US NOT JUST GET ACCUSTOMED TO THE THINGS
[2:50:26] that we do, but we may understand that
[2:50:29] this is a preparing time. Help us, Lord,
[2:50:32] and lead us, oh God, and and if there be
[2:50:36] any need in the building, Lord, you
[2:50:39] you're the great Jehovah.
[2:50:43] The seven redemptive names belong to
[2:50:45] you.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; There's no need here that escapes you,
[2:50:49] Lord. And
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you even raise up our
[2:50:53] pastor this morning and just give him
[2:50:55] strength, oh God. And Father, renew his
[2:50:58] youth once again. And Father, just give
[2:51:00] him many more years to come. And Father,
[2:51:03] sharpen his mind, his body, and
[2:51:05] everything that he may serve you even
[2:51:07] more, Lord. And we commit all that we
[2:51:09] are to you because you promise that you
[2:51:12] yourself, you are the living word. And
[2:51:14] and father, you said that Jesus Christ
[2:51:16] is the revealed word of the hour and you
[2:51:19] here, Father, to make yourself a reality
[2:51:22] to the believer. We ask that you do
[2:51:25] that. Give it according to your will and
[2:51:27] way. We commit it to you in Jesus name
[2:51:30] we pray. Amen.
[2:51:33] All there are to [singing] roll.
