[0:00] lord we ask lord that if there's
[0:02] anything in our hearts and our minds
[0:04] lord that would separate us from your
[0:05] word
[0:06] lord that you would remove it lord as
[0:09] the word comes forth lord let us be able
[0:11] to look at it and say identify with that
[0:13] lord that's
[0:13] me that's me lord right there
[0:16] [Music]
[0:17] father as we lift up our voices and
[0:19] praise lord let it be from our hearts
[0:21] lord that we may worship you in spirit
[0:23] and in truth
[0:24] for we know there's angels gathered
[0:26] around you that can that can sing
[0:27] praises unto you
[0:29] father but but we're here as a
[0:30] redemption father that your blood has
[0:32] cleansed us lord
[0:35] lord we come before you lord look into
[0:37] that blood lord for our salvation and
[0:39] the grace that you've given us father
[0:42] let our hearts cry out to you father the
[0:44] love and the adoration that we have for
[0:46] you and lord in these days father
[0:49] we ask these things lord in jesus
[0:50] christ's name amen
[0:53] amen amen
[0:56] we've been happy to be gathering the
[0:58] presence of the living god
[0:59] i want to welcome everyone all our
[1:01] visitors god bless you this morning
[1:03] as invited by the mic for us so i'm
[1:04] reading amen
[1:10] good morning we'll go ahead and turn to
[1:12] psalm 120 this morning
[1:18] you know when we talk about david a lot
[1:22] of things pop into our mind a lot of
[1:24] characteristics you know we think of
[1:27] things like david was a man after god's
[1:29] own heart
[1:30] and how he was used as a standard and
[1:32] example
[1:33] of what every kingdom should be through
[1:36] the history of israel
[1:39] but you know it's one thing that does
[1:41] not come to mind when you think of david
[1:43] as him being a liar
[1:45] that isn't the first thing that pops in
[1:46] the mind and yet if we look at psalm 120
[1:49] and verse 2 here's his cry out to the
[1:53] lord deliver me
[1:55] deliver my soul o lord from lying lips
[1:58] and from a deceitful tongue
[2:01] and you know we've got to thinking about
[2:03] that and and
[2:04] just looking at what a lie is you know
[2:07] it's not necessarily
[2:08] just a pattern of dishonesty or
[2:10] purposeful dishonesty
[2:12] but it's allowing your lips to be a
[2:14] carrier of something that's not the
[2:16] truth
[2:17] even if you don't intend it to be and
[2:20] it's interesting to me that as he's
[2:21] crying out to the lord he's asking the
[2:23] lord for deliverance from this don't let
[2:25] my lips
[2:26] don't let my tongue be something that's
[2:28] a carrier
[2:29] of something that's not truth or is
[2:32] deceitful
[2:33] you know and that looking at that cry
[2:34] you know it's if you look even at
[2:36] webster's dictionary a lie as something
[2:37] that's a false impression whether you
[2:39] believe it or not
[2:40] it can even be unintentional but it
[2:42] could become a you can become a
[2:43] vessel or an instrument of of sharing
[2:45] something like this
[2:47] and you know the thing is for us it's
[2:49] the same for us you know there's only
[2:50] one truth
[2:52] there's the truth and we know from the
[2:55] scripture that a lie is only one word
[2:57] away
[2:58] so how we should be so careful to make
[3:02] sure that what comes forth out of our
[3:03] witness
[3:04] out of our narrative the message we
[3:06] bring the the
[3:08] the testimony we bring is not one word
[3:10] off
[3:11] from the truth right in first
[3:14] corinthians 14
[3:15] 10 it says there are it may be
[3:18] so many kinds of voices in the world
[3:21] and none of them is without
[3:23] signification
[3:25] we're surrounded by narratives
[3:28] by voices by messages by witnesses and
[3:30] in
[3:31] if we're not careful we can take one up
[3:33] and make it part
[3:34] of our message and in so doing turn his
[3:37] message
[3:39] into dishonesty or falsehood right
[3:42] you know in john 10 verse 4 it says and
[3:45] when he put
[3:46] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[3:49] and the sheep follow him for they know
[3:52] his voice
[3:54] and a stranger will they not follow but
[3:56] will flee from him
[3:57] for they know not the voice of strangers
[4:01] you know this what other truth is there
[4:04] but the word
[4:05] right there is no other truth in fact
[4:07] you know
[4:08] it says that um you know he says deliver
[4:11] my soul from lying lips and from a
[4:13] deceitful tongue i like the way that
[4:14] brother david put it a couple weeks ago
[4:16] helped on my unbelief not purposeful
[4:19] disbelief
[4:20] but just help all of the things that i
[4:22] will you know that
[4:23] hinder me being able to speak forth and
[4:26] realize the whole truth
[4:28] you know so what should come out of our
[4:30] lips what should
[4:31] our tongue be used for well david talks
[4:33] about that too psalm 17
[4:35] 4 concerning the works of men
[4:38] by the word of thy lips
[4:41] i have kept me from the paths of the
[4:43] destroyer
[4:46] in psalm 119 13 it says with my lips
[4:49] have i declared all the judgments of
[4:52] thyma
[4:53] you know not any other voice but his not
[4:56] any other
[4:57] narrative but his not any other witness
[5:00] but his
[5:01] psalm 119 171 my lips
[5:04] shall utter praise when thou has taught
[5:07] me thy statutes
[5:09] my tongue shall speak of thy word
[5:13] for all thy commandments are righteous
[5:16] you know when i think of that last verse
[5:18] in romans 10 8 the word is nigh thee
[5:21] even in thy mouth and in my in thy heart
[5:25] that is the word of faith
[5:26] which we preach so you know as i got to
[5:29] thinking about that
[5:30] recognizing you know david was not a
[5:32] dishonest man he was not a liar he was
[5:34] quick to repent when he was caught
[5:35] in something but how he feels such
[5:39] a burden that he not get caught up
[5:42] being a bearer of a false witness
[5:46] even unintentionally you know i i pray
[5:48] the same thing for myself and i hope all
[5:50] the rest of us do that we're so careful
[5:53] that as witnesses
[5:54] we're not a witness of somebody else's
[5:56] message for a witness of his message
[5:58] that we don't adopt some other narrative
[6:00] that turns his message into someone
[6:02] else's message
[6:03] right let's not retweet or
[6:06] quote or like or whatever something that
[6:10] does not
[6:10] reflect him right so as we look at that
[6:14] deliver my deliver us from lying lips
[6:16] and from a deceitful tongue
[6:18] let's read that in psalm 120 together
[6:21] just a short psalm
[6:24] in my distress i cried unto the lord
[6:27] and he heard me deliver my soul o lord
[6:30] from lying lips and from a deceitful
[6:33] tongue
[6:34] what shall be given unto thee or what
[6:37] shall be done unto thee
[6:38] thou false tongue sharp arrows of the
[6:41] mighty
[6:42] with coals of juniper woe is me
[6:45] that i sojourn in message that i dwell
[6:48] in the tents of ketter
[6:50] my soul hath long dwelt with him that
[6:52] hateth peace
[6:54] i am for peace but when i speak there
[6:57] for war
[7:04] amen god bless you may have your seeds
[7:07] amen let's sing such love that god will
[7:10] love a sinner such as i
[7:14] am
[7:17] that god should love us

[32:13] and amen god bless you this morning if
[32:15] you have your bibles
[32:16] let's turn to
[32:21] the first epistle of corinthians
[32:25] and we'd like to read
[32:34] starting in the 17th verse
[32:38] of first corinthians
[32:42] first corinthians 1 and 17.
[32:51] and we just trust the lord will be our
[32:54] portion this morning and
[32:56] that we
[33:00] can be blessed for christ
[33:04] sent me not to baptize
[33:08] but to preach the gospel
[33:11] not with wisdom of words lest
[33:15] the cross of christ should be made
[33:18] of none effect for the preaching
[33:22] of the cross is to them that perish
[33:26] foolishness but unto us
[33:29] which are saved it is the power of god
[33:33] for it is written i will destroy the
[33:36] wisdom
[33:37] of the wise and bring to
[33:41] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[33:45] where is the wise where is
[33:48] the scribe where is the disputer
[33:52] of this world hath god
[33:57] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[34:02] for after that in the wisdom
[34:05] of god the world by wisdom
[34:09] knew not god it pleased god
[34:12] by the foolishness of preaching to save
[34:15] them
[34:16] that believe for the jew requires a sign
[34:22] and the greek seeketh after wisdom
[34:25] but we preach christ crucified unto the
[34:28] jews the stumbling block
[34:31] and unto the greek foolishness
[34:34] but unto them which are called both
[34:37] jew and greek christ the power of god
[34:42] and the wisdom of god because the
[34:46] foolishness of god
[34:47] is wiser than man and the weakness of
[34:51] god
[34:52] is stronger than man for
[34:55] ye see your calling brethren
[34:59] how that not many wise after the flesh
[35:03] and not might not many mighty
[35:07] not many noble are called
[35:10] but god hath chosen the foolish things
[35:13] of the world to confound the wise
[35:16] and god hath chosen the weak things
[35:19] of the world to confine the things which
[35:22] are mighty
[35:23] and the base things of the world and
[35:27] things which are despised
[35:29] hath god chosen yea the things which
[35:32] are not to bring to not the things
[35:35] that are and no flesh should glory in
[35:39] his presence
[35:40] but of him ye are called in christ jesus
[35:44] whom of god is made unto us wisdom
[35:48] and righteousness and sanctification
[35:52] and redemption that according as it is
[35:55] written
[35:56] he that glorieth let him glory in
[35:59] the lord father bless your word
[36:02] in your precious name we pray you may be
[36:05] seated
[36:10] it says in the 26th verse for ye
[36:15] see your calling brethren
[36:18] you see your calling brethren i think
[36:22] that's a wonderful thing
[36:24] for the believer to be able to
[36:28] see their calling and uh
[36:31] that's what we'd like just to kind of uh
[36:34] fellowship a little bit about
[36:38] this morning is uh certainly
[36:42] is our calling what is our
[36:45] calling this morning and i'd like to uh
[36:48] read a few statements this morning and
[36:51] then
[36:52] play a little portion of the sermon to
[36:55] us
[36:56] and kind of build on that
[36:59] and any other man makes this statement
[37:04] and he says now faith is
[37:07] based on forgiveness
[37:10] and so we just heard paul
[37:14] talk about here that he came and he
[37:17] preached
[37:21] to us christ crucified
[37:24] and christ crucified is the forgiveness
[37:28] of sins
[37:30] that him dying on the cross and
[37:33] and giving his life for us and
[37:36] offering to us through that death of
[37:39] calvary
[37:41] resurrection life and he said now the
[37:44] preaching of this
[37:45] to the wise and the prudent
[37:49] of the world is foolishness
[37:53] they don't want to place their hope in
[37:55] that they don't want to place their
[37:56] trust in it
[37:58] but to us it's the wisdom
[38:01] and it it's the revelation and it's the
[38:05] knowledge of god
[38:06] to us it's hope to them
[38:10] they they don't consider it but to us
[38:13] we consider it and all of our trust and
[38:16] all of our hope
[38:17] is placed in the fact that he died
[38:21] for us because upon this principle
[38:25] we can go forward without it we're stuck
[38:29] and that's why you looked at a world
[38:31] today that stuck
[38:33] they don't know how to overcome we see
[38:37] that every word almost out of
[38:40] uh the society today
[38:44] and and uh that's coming out of the
[38:47] mouth
[38:48] of the representatives of our political
[38:52] powers that's
[38:53] coming out of the mouths of everybody
[38:56] that
[38:57] is facing a conflict is they say we're
[39:00] going and we're turning to the science
[39:05] that's what we're looking for we're
[39:06] looking for our hope
[39:08] in science the science will figure it
[39:11] out
[39:11] the the wise will figure it out the
[39:15] doctors
[39:16] will figure it out so all our hope is i
[39:18] hope that these great men
[39:21] uh get this figure out amen
[39:24] aren't you glad that you don't have to
[39:26] wait them to figure it out
[39:29] aren't you glad you got a great
[39:31] physician
[39:32] aren't you glad you've got something
[39:34] that is
[39:35] above anything that man could ever come
[39:39] up with
[39:40] when all hope is given away and all
[39:44] things are gone and science is wore out
[39:47] and intellect is worn out aren't you
[39:50] glad you can look at a cross
[39:53] aren't you glad he died for you aren't
[39:56] you glad
[39:57] that he's real and and so
[40:00] uh the prophet of gods makes this
[40:03] statement
[40:04] in the message perfect faith will listen
[40:06] to a portion this morning
[40:09] now faith is based on forgiveness
[40:12] then so when paul went out
[40:16] and he began to preach he said faith is
[40:19] uh he preached christ crucified
[40:23] because faith is based on forgiveness
[40:27] i want you to hold that there because
[40:30] that's something you can go forward in
[40:33] faith
[40:34] because you are forgiven
[40:38] okay if you can't leave those things
[40:41] which
[40:41] are behind you'll never press
[40:45] for the higher calling that's before you
[40:49] so before we can ever have faith now
[40:53] remember the promise that we
[40:56] have for this age is the restoration
[41:00] of the faith of our fathers and that
[41:03] faith being returned back to
[41:07] the children so there's going to be a
[41:10] relationship
[41:11] and a restoration of the faith of our
[41:15] fathers
[41:16] and the children and they're going to
[41:18] come back into the same
[41:20] thing that they that was in the
[41:23] beginning
[41:24] that the church was built on the church
[41:27] would that would be restored
[41:29] back to the church and the thing that
[41:32] that place
[41:33] is is based on
[41:36] calvary because god only has one
[41:39] place that he meets the believer and
[41:42] that's
[41:43] under the shed blood so you've got to
[41:46] know that that
[41:48] blood that blood of the cross that blood
[41:51] of the lamb i
[41:52] i kind of make this picture
[41:55] in my mind for myself i'll i'll share
[41:59] my little picture with you and you'll
[42:02] find out that
[42:03] i have a lot of ways to comfort myself
[42:06] but i know my shortcomings
[42:11] i know my failures i know my weaknesses
[42:15] and so this side of my life i stand here
[42:19] and here's david mcgary and
[42:21] paul would say that when i would do good
[42:24] evil is with me in other words he says
[42:27] that satan is always with you he's
[42:30] always
[42:30] buffeting you he's always tempting you
[42:33] he's always
[42:34] laying everything out in front of you
[42:36] but i
[42:37] picture my life and all my failures and
[42:40] my weaknesses and my frustration
[42:42] and i picture the uh like a great
[42:46] painter
[42:47] uh taking a brush and dipping it in and
[42:50] i look at the lord
[42:51] dipping his brush in the blood of the
[42:54] lamb
[42:55] and just painting over my life with the
[42:58] blood of the lamb
[43:00] that covering that part of my life up
[43:03] that he doesn't see that part of my life
[43:06] there's a blood
[43:07] covering there there's a lamb has
[43:10] painted that and blotted
[43:12] that out of my life and so i i
[43:15] i when as long as he looks through that
[43:18] he
[43:18] sees the forgiveness and my red sins
[43:22] through red blood he said
[43:23] red through red makes it white as snow
[43:27] but if i step out from under that blouse
[43:32] oh my can i i try to do it on my own
[43:36] righteousness
[43:37] paul said don't do that your
[43:39] righteousness is his filthy rise
[43:42] he is our righteousness just climb back
[43:45] underneath the blood of the lamb
[43:49] the forgiveness i've been forgiven
[43:54] that's all that we've got i've been
[43:58] forgiven
[43:59] we don't have any righteousness but we
[44:02] have forgiveness
[44:03] therefore faith is
[44:07] based upon forgiveness
[44:10] you can have faith because you're
[44:12] forgiven now
[44:14] this uh this stands out to me and
[44:17] it motivates me this morning to share
[44:20] this
[44:21] in my heart it said now
[44:24] faith is based on forgiveness and then
[44:28] as we said this morning trying to get
[44:32] the church
[44:34] into the place to
[44:37] where we can really see
[44:41] apostolic times moving
[44:44] among us that's what we
[44:49] all hunger for
[44:53] and and i i we talked about thirsting
[44:56] and hungering and he said that's what
[44:59] we're really
[45:01] uh hungering for because
[45:04] why are we hungering that
[45:07] apostolic times would be
[45:10] moving back in our things that we can
[45:14] see
[45:14] the apostolic times we can see it moving
[45:18] and flowing through us because the seed
[45:21] in us calls for the promise
[45:24] amen that's right
[45:28] that's what you hunger for you can only
[45:30] hunger
[45:31] for a deep that's calling
[45:35] for a deep there's got to be a deep to
[45:37] respond
[45:38] so if there's a promise to the seed
[45:41] that that there's going to be a faith of
[45:44] our father's restored
[45:46] then naturally that seed has a built-in
[45:50] desire in it to thirst
[45:53] after what's promised it
[45:58] that's what our call is that's what our
[46:00] hunger is that's what
[46:02] we're placed here that's what we're
[46:04] promised
[46:06] and therefore there's something in us
[46:08] that hungers
[46:09] and thirsts for the apostolic
[46:12] move of god in our lives
[46:15] now it goes beyond that
[46:19] god had a purpose for putting that there
[46:23] he put he had a purpose for placing that
[46:26] thirst within us and that's what he said
[46:29] he said now because you see your calling
[46:37] you're never going to move
[46:40] until you see your calling you're dead
[46:44] in the water
[46:45] until you see your calling see
[46:49] means to understand he said it doesn't
[46:51] mean to see with your eyes
[46:52] it means to understand with your heart
[46:55] you'll never go
[46:56] forward until that you have a revelation
[46:59] of what that you've been called for so
[47:02] let's listen as he speaks these things
[47:05] he says
[47:07] he says trying to get the church
[47:11] into the place
[47:14] to where we could really see
[47:17] apostolic times moving among us
[47:22] that's all right now if the messenger
[47:26] is trying to get the church to that
[47:28] place
[47:30] where we see apostolic times
[47:33] moving among us then i i think if
[47:37] a man's gonna preach this gospel
[47:40] he ought to have the same motive and
[47:43] objective that the giver of the message
[47:46] has
[47:49] because without that we have what
[47:52] denominations
[47:53] are they're men that took this gospel
[47:56] and for their own motives and their own
[47:58] objectives and their own reasoning and
[48:01] their own purpose
[48:02] and their own glory they manipulated the
[48:06] gospel
[48:08] that's why in paul in corinthians says i
[48:10] baptized none of you saved this house in
[48:12] this house
[48:13] because the wisdom of man is not
[48:16] if any man glory let them glory in
[48:19] christ
[48:23] well if you're going to glory in him you
[48:24] have to glory in his purpose
[48:30] you have to glory in his reason
[48:33] and that's what this messenger was sent
[48:35] for he was sent
[48:37] that the apostolic faith
[48:40] the faith of our fathers would move in
[48:44] us again
[48:48] but let us read further
[48:52] and it's just laying right at the door
[48:56] we see it but we want to see
[49:00] it more of it we want
[49:05] we want it such a
[49:08] flow till it
[49:11] will be a help to
[49:14] us and flow out
[49:17] to others
[49:21] he says we see it right at the door
[49:25] and we did we saw it at the door
[49:31] we suck out to the door
[49:34] you understand we saw when the
[49:36] discernment went forth
[49:37] we just saw when the sick were healed
[49:41] we saw it when it began to move out in
[49:45] the world and telling us that
[49:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[49:49] forever behold
[49:51] i stand at the door and knock if any man
[49:54] open
[49:55] i will come unto him and open the
[49:57] evening and
[49:58] sup with him so we saw this saw it at
[50:02] the door
[50:05] we saw him knocking we saw him
[50:08] we saw the signs we saw the restoration
[50:11] we saw the message of restoration we saw
[50:14] it at the door
[50:15] but it's just now we want more of it
[50:19] we want to get to the place where we're
[50:21] walking in at that one
[50:22] it'll help us
[50:28] because it always begins at the
[50:31] household of faith
[50:35] that's right why should we talk about
[50:39] healing the world
[50:40] if we don't have healing in our midst
[50:43] why should we talk about delivering the
[50:45] sinner if we don't have
[50:47] our children delivered why should we
[50:50] talk about
[50:50] doing this and so you're talking about
[50:53] something you
[50:54] don't have that you don't experience
[50:58] so what the first place we got to do is
[51:00] charity
[51:01] begins at the household of faith
[51:07] so we want more of it
[51:10] so can help us
[51:14] help our loved ones first of all
[51:18] we've got to make it real here
[51:26] it's got to become real
[51:29] and i i think that's what he said he
[51:31] said we got to have it moving
[51:34] so it's got to become real
[51:39] not something we're talking about
[51:43] i i wanted to save this statement but i
[51:46] think i'll
[51:47] i'll just put it in
[51:51] right here if the lord would help me
[51:53] we're talking about
[51:54] something that's real he says
[51:58] therefore
[52:02] he said he's talking about a man that he
[52:04] prayed for
[52:05] brother bran prayed for this baby
[52:08] and it had club feet he said it was
[52:10] terribly deformed
[52:13] he said and i prayed for it and he said
[52:16] the next day i was
[52:18] in town and i saw the man
[52:21] shopping for shoes for that baby
[52:27] i don't remember if it was brother
[52:29] mitchell or
[52:32] but the man came to brother braham's
[52:35] meetings
[52:36] carrying a pair of new shoes
[52:39] and he was uh he was diagnosed with
[52:43] black lung and brother branham called
[52:47] them out
[52:48] and uh he in his heart he said i don't
[52:51] uh i'm i'm going to wear these new shoes
[52:54] you know what i mean
[52:55] and he he made a move by faith
[52:59] and i meant the man
[53:02] he said when i went there he said
[53:06] i just knew it
[53:12] and so we've got to make this church
[53:16] you understand we've got to get out of
[53:19] the
[53:20] intellectual side of this message
[53:28] we've got to rise to higher ground we've
[53:30] got to rise to higher heights
[53:34] and that was the sin of nickelodeonism
[53:38] the people let the ministry rise to a
[53:41] higher height
[53:42] they let go they let they pick somebody
[53:44] and they say well we'll let him pray for
[53:46] the sick we'll let him do the work
[53:48] we'll let him do this and him do that
[53:51] and everything
[53:52] and now that then after they did that
[53:55] they empowered them
[53:57] they gave them the power god
[54:00] never intended to share his glory
[54:04] with any man with any
[54:07] system with any group of men
[54:10] this is an individual affair
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:20] and i'll pray for you as a christian
[54:27] but don't make me pray for you as a
[54:28] priest
[54:34] i'll forgive your sins because the bible
[54:37] tells me to forgive your sin
[54:40] but don't make me a confessor
[54:47] i mean we got to take up your
[54:50] responsibility
[54:52] so listen what he said he said like this
[54:55] man over here
[54:57] that believed that god would give him a
[55:00] baby
[55:02] sure he believed it it was going to
[55:04] happen
[55:05] he made ready for it i'm
[55:09] making ready although no physical
[55:12] results seen as yet
[55:15] but that didn't make a bit of difference
[55:18] he believed it like abraham
[55:22] call anything contrary as
[55:25] though it was not there
[55:31] now this is what we've got to move past
[55:36] now and brother braham says this is a
[55:39] stinger
[55:41] but i believe he really cared for us
[55:44] don't you
[55:45] didn't we just listen to standing in the
[55:47] gap where he said
[55:49] i'd lost the feeling of the people and i
[55:51] just wanted to go out
[55:53] and and do it and we just got done
[55:55] listening to that and reading that and
[55:57] talking about that
[55:58] how that that he said you've done the
[56:00] same thing moses did
[56:01] you lost the feeling of the people well
[56:04] why did the holy spirit
[56:06] you know god's orchestrating these
[56:08] things
[56:11] when he tells us he says hey
[56:16] don't lose the feeling of the people
[56:21] well i'm praying the other day and i i
[56:23] get
[56:24] i get i have a lot of complexes i deal
[56:27] with
[56:28] because i'm not educated and i don't
[56:30] have a good vocabulary and
[56:32] and okay my mind i i got just my mind
[56:35] can't multitask and i'll be talking to
[56:38] somebody and something will come on my
[56:40] mind
[56:42] and walk away right in the middle of the
[56:43] congregate you know a conversation and
[56:46] and so all these things come up of
[56:48] course then i go get the message perfect
[56:50] strength and perfect weakness
[56:52] you can't use that as an excuse and you
[56:54] can't use your talents as a screw
[56:56] my grace is sufficient for you
[57:02] but i prayed and i said lord where can i
[57:04] lead the people
[57:05] where should i lead them
[57:09] in which direction should i take them
[57:13] i really want to know i mean if i'm a
[57:16] shepherd and
[57:18] and if you stay in the same spot
[57:21] you'll lead up the grass
[57:25] you know and then you just keep adding
[57:26] seasoning
[57:28] to the same stuff you know what i mean
[57:31] like
[57:32] it becomes like leftovers
[57:38] you know so you got left what do you
[57:39] have today well it's
[57:41] chicken cacciatore well you have chicken
[57:44] casserole
[57:46] you know chicken tacos chicken this
[57:49] chicken that
[57:50] you become like a chinese buffet you
[57:52] know 450
[57:54] ways to do chicken
[57:58] it's the same chicken
[58:03] you know i want to move
[58:07] i want to know i'm going in the right
[58:09] direction
[58:11] i want to be able to say lord i let you
[58:13] i said lord where where would you have
[58:15] me lead the people
[58:19] what direction where where should this
[58:23] congregation be going
[58:26] now i know this is going to astound you
[58:30] well maybe it won't astound you but it
[58:32] it it almost couldn't get up off the
[58:34] ground
[58:36] with the answer i said where would you
[58:39] love lord teach me speak to me where
[58:42] would you
[58:43] like them for me to lead this
[58:45] congregation
[58:47] and his answer to me was to
[58:50] the public
[58:58] what i thought we're supposed to be
[59:03] running from the world
[59:09] unboxing i'm supposed to lead them
[59:11] you're saying to the public
[59:17] lead them to the public
[59:21] then you begin to show me why
[59:24] and so that's what i want to share with
[59:27] you
[59:28] today this is what this is about this is
[59:31] about the
[59:32] rapture now listen what he said
[59:37] therefore your intellect does
[59:40] tell you oh here's the stinger now
[59:44] if your intellect does tell you
[59:48] that this is the truth
[59:52] god is the healer of the sick
[59:58] your mind can witness that
[1:00:01] that that's the truth
[1:00:06] but if there's not the betting ground
[1:00:10] in your heart
[1:00:14] faith to fall in to
[1:00:18] express it it
[1:00:21] will not happen
[1:00:27] so that's the difference
[1:00:31] it's different if we all sit here
[1:00:35] in our mind and in our
[1:00:38] intellect and say that's
[1:00:41] the truth
[1:00:44] that's the truth god's a healer that's
[1:00:47] the truth that's the truth that's the
[1:00:49] truth
[1:00:50] we intellectually can witness it
[1:00:54] that that's the truth and that's what
[1:00:57] the prophet of god said he said when
[1:00:59] it's in your mind
[1:01:02] and then it drops from your mind into
[1:01:05] your heart
[1:01:08] into that bedding ground
[1:01:12] where it can grow he says then it
[1:01:15] becomes
[1:01:16] the will of god then you know it
[1:01:22] then you can say not only is it the
[1:01:24] truth
[1:01:25] but now i can act upon it
[1:01:29] i can express it
[1:01:34] and what good as if if we have no record
[1:01:39] of expression
[1:01:43] because he said that this church this
[1:01:46] elect lady
[1:01:47] this bride would have a book of acts
[1:01:50] written
[1:01:50] after it
[1:01:58] okay now we we we got we we we've talked
[1:02:01] about that betting ground
[1:02:03] we've talked about that seed so
[1:02:06] he he we go we go in and
[1:02:09] we listen and so we we desire
[1:02:12] for those apostolic
[1:02:16] times to be moving we should be
[1:02:19] thirsting
[1:02:21] and hungering to be a people that lays
[1:02:25] our hands on the sick
[1:02:27] and they recover
[1:02:31] we should be a people that longs for
[1:02:33] when we kneel down to pray
[1:02:36] that we touch the hem of his garment and
[1:02:38] whatsoever things you ask
[1:02:40] or whatever things you see knock and it
[1:02:43] shall be opened unto you
[1:02:44] seek and you shall find in no wise will
[1:02:48] i cast you out
[1:02:51] and i don't mean alive in
[1:02:55] a few
[1:03:00] i mean alive in the body we're a body
[1:03:04] fitted and joined together each member
[1:03:06] supplying a need to the other
[1:03:09] we're all going to go i don't want to
[1:03:11] leave anybody behind
[1:03:14] we need everybody's participation
[1:03:18] we need everybody in their place
[1:03:21] everybody
[1:03:22] that's what i could that's a sermon in
[1:03:24] itself
[1:03:28] about the great watch he said though you
[1:03:31] might see the face
[1:03:32] like we're a great watch this morning i
[1:03:35] might be the
[1:03:36] the digital timepiece
[1:03:41] or the face but it's all the moving
[1:03:45] parts behind
[1:03:46] it that move the hands
[1:03:51] you you take out the little spring you
[1:03:54] take out this
[1:03:55] you take out that it can that clock it
[1:03:58] should
[1:03:59] what good is if it always says
[1:04:02] nine o'clock what time is it nine
[1:04:05] o'clock
[1:04:09] well later with that nine o'clock
[1:04:12] where's the church at
[1:04:13] nine o'clock
[1:04:17] we're at the same place the same time
[1:04:21] getting the same read just nine o'clock
[1:04:24] granny
[1:04:26] where are you guys at where's your
[1:04:28] church at nine o'clock
[1:04:34] what do you talk about nine o'clock
[1:04:39] why because something's not
[1:04:42] fixed something's not working
[1:04:46] something's not in its place
[1:04:50] what good does it do to have a watch
[1:04:54] since we're using that as a type and a
[1:04:56] battery
[1:04:58] if there's nothing that's calling for
[1:05:01] the juice
[1:05:02] from the battery
[1:05:12] like like the truck right or the car
[1:05:16] it's got to have the spark
[1:05:20] well i experienced that this morning
[1:05:26] my truck's got the spark but i ran out
[1:05:30] of the
[1:05:34] dynamics
[1:05:36] coasted from halfway in central
[1:05:39] into the driveway around to the back
[1:05:44] and my trucks laying there dead as a
[1:05:48] doornail
[1:05:50] because there's no gas
[1:05:59] now my truck told me how many miles to
[1:06:02] empty zero
[1:06:08] and i made it
[1:06:13] and if i didn't make it i was gonna walk
[1:06:18] but you know you understand there
[1:06:21] there had to be a call
[1:06:26] so i ran out of gas god hasn't run out
[1:06:30] of gas
[1:06:32] god hasn't run out of power god hasn't
[1:06:35] run out of jews
[1:06:37] god hasn't run out of electricity i just
[1:06:40] wonder is there anything
[1:06:41] calling for it
[1:06:47] is there anything thirsting after it
[1:06:53] we have not because we asked not
[1:06:57] and we asked not because
[1:07:06] there's a reason it's important
[1:07:11] that is freed
[1:07:16] i want you to get this now
[1:07:20] the church has got to lift
[1:07:24] itself into the power
[1:07:28] of god
[1:07:34] that's a statement
[1:07:38] see we always teach it if you
[1:07:41] if you don't have the power of god
[1:07:43] you're not a believer
[1:07:45] i hope we put that to a rest
[1:07:49] i've tried to preach it for several
[1:07:51] sundays you
[1:07:52] are believers
[1:07:56] we even went back to the evidence
[1:08:00] of election to go back over that before
[1:08:04] you even
[1:08:05] knew you were elected he was working the
[1:08:07] process
[1:08:08] on you he made he convicted you he made
[1:08:13] you
[1:08:13] miserable you were hungering and
[1:08:15] thirsting you were longing for something
[1:08:17] all these things was the hand of god in
[1:08:20] your life
[1:08:21] before you ever came to the realization
[1:08:24] and revelation that you were
[1:08:28] a christian or a believer
[1:08:31] because while you were yet sinners
[1:08:35] he died for you so while you were yet a
[1:08:38] sinner
[1:08:38] he had to purchase you well you were
[1:08:41] lost he had to seek you
[1:08:43] you didn't choose me i chose you
[1:08:46] so though his work has been going on
[1:08:50] for a long time but now this is a
[1:08:54] different approach
[1:08:57] this is a different message
[1:09:01] this isn't salvation
[1:09:04] we've settled that amen
[1:09:08] this isn't the mind
[1:09:12] acknowledging its truth this is it
[1:09:15] dropping
[1:09:16] into the betting ground
[1:09:21] the heart
[1:09:26] that there's something in us amen
[1:09:29] that wants to bear the fruit
[1:09:32] that we've been chosen and elected to
[1:09:36] bear
[1:09:38] that oh my goodness you see when he went
[1:09:42] up to that fig tree
[1:09:48] he went to take figs
[1:09:51] it didn't matter if that fig tree said
[1:09:54] who are you
[1:09:56] fig tree my daddy was a fig tree
[1:10:03] his grandfather was a fig tree
[1:10:08] we can go all the way back to egypt
[1:10:16] says you're barren and unfruitful
[1:10:21] and he cursed the fig tree
[1:10:24] and they came back and says master look
[1:10:26] at the fig tree it's all dried up
[1:10:30] and because i want you to know all them
[1:10:32] that are barren
[1:10:33] and unfruitful will be plucked up
[1:10:39] so we've been preaching and saying it's
[1:10:42] not who you are
[1:10:46] it's what you are
[1:10:50] he had no evidence
[1:10:54] that he was a fig tree
[1:10:57] no expression that it was a fig tree
[1:11:04] when they came to jesus and the only
[1:11:07] evidence they could see was a man
[1:11:13] he says you a man yet not being 30 years
[1:11:17] of age
[1:11:19] or 50 years of age they said but you say
[1:11:21] before abraham
[1:11:23] was i am
[1:11:26] oh yeah and when he came down he said if
[1:11:30] you can't believe me for my word's sake
[1:11:33] believe me for my works
[1:11:38] because i do nothing unless the father
[1:11:42] reveals it to me
[1:11:47] so he's talking he says here now he says
[1:11:51] we've got the church has got to lift
[1:11:53] itself
[1:11:54] up into the power of god how we are
[1:11:58] too close to the end now
[1:12:01] and i believe the church is in the
[1:12:04] condition
[1:12:05] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:12:08] things
[1:12:09] and rub some of this make
[1:12:12] belief out see
[1:12:16] and get into something real
[1:12:21] see it's got to be something
[1:12:24] that you know
[1:12:31] got to be something that do you know
[1:12:35] now we're going to stop right here
[1:12:38] before
[1:12:38] we go further and we're going to listen
[1:12:41] to
[1:12:42] 11 minutes that's all
[1:12:47] it's not too long a perfect faith
[1:12:53] and these 11 minutes are going to be
[1:12:56] emphasized
[1:12:57] on the foundation of your faith
[1:13:01] in other words lifting yourself up
[1:13:06] and he's going to mention about
[1:13:09] who you are and he uses more than who
[1:13:13] you are
[1:13:14] he says what you are what you are
[1:13:17] you've got to believe what god has made
[1:13:20] you
[1:13:21] you've got to believe what you are what
[1:13:23] you are
[1:13:24] we don't go forward
[1:13:29] i don't know why
[1:13:33] maybe it's because we keep stepping out
[1:13:36] from behind the blood
[1:13:39] instead of letting that blood be our
[1:13:42] righteousness
[1:13:44] because our faith is based
[1:13:47] on that blood covering
[1:13:54] amen why can you do why can you pray for
[1:13:57] the sick
[1:13:59] because i have power
[1:14:03] no
[1:14:08] he said
[1:14:12] well how are you going to get results
[1:14:15] look at you nope uh-uh
[1:14:20] i've got a blood covering
[1:14:23] you see this shield that i'm covered in
[1:14:27] you see this blood that's over my life
[1:14:30] over my failures
[1:14:31] when did he put it there
[1:14:38] well you were yet a sinner before you
[1:14:40] were saying he died for you
[1:14:42] where did he put it there he put it
[1:14:44] there in the back
[1:14:45] way back in the beginning when sin came
[1:14:48] so did the covering
[1:14:52] he said i'll make enmity between thy
[1:14:54] seed in the woman's seed
[1:14:56] i'll bruise your heel
[1:15:01] he had that savior planned there all
[1:15:03] along
[1:15:04] he had that blood covering for the
[1:15:06] church there all along
[1:15:07] that's the only place that god will meet
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:11] meet your prayers meet any requests that
[1:15:15] you have
[1:15:16] god only meets the believer under the
[1:15:19] shed blood
[1:15:20] that's god's provided place of worship
[1:15:27] you can't prove your faith no more than
[1:15:30] you can prove your love
[1:15:36] it's the only one way
[1:15:40] is through expression now let's just
[1:15:43] listen to this
[1:15:46] 11 minutes because we we want to build
[1:15:50] on this if the lord will help is this 11
[1:15:52] minutes is enough
[1:15:56] and i would love to play so much more
[1:15:58] but if we can just listen to this 11
[1:16:00] minutes and then
[1:16:01] and go for it and you can go home and
[1:16:03] listen to the rest of it just listen
[1:16:06] and he's going to talk to in the
[1:16:09] first statement the story is
[1:16:13] that the disciples
[1:16:17] have just brought the boy
[1:16:20] with epilepsy
[1:16:23] to jesus and said master
[1:16:27] your disciples could not cast them out
[1:16:33] and they asked him how come we couldn't
[1:16:36] cast him out
[1:16:39] and he rebuked them and said because you
[1:16:43] believe not
[1:16:48] in other words they didn't they hadn't
[1:16:50] gone down to the bedding ground
[1:16:54] and so this is where he picks up the
[1:16:56] story
[1:16:57] and he's he's talking about
[1:17:00] and the first words now remember they
[1:17:03] had the power
[1:17:06] jesus had given them
[1:17:09] the power i i believe that's where we're
[1:17:12] going to start is paragraph
[1:17:14] 55 in perfect faith let's just listen to
[1:17:17] this 11 minutes
[1:17:18] lord willing god bless you
[1:17:33] i remember they had this house
[1:17:37] jesus had given them power the healer
[1:17:40] was sick to raise the dead and cast out
[1:17:42] devils just a few days before that
[1:17:44] yeah they had the power
[1:17:47] but not the faith to use the power
[1:17:51] now there's the brandon tabernacle
[1:17:53] there's the church the bride today
[1:17:56] the holy spirit is shared with the power
[1:17:59] but you haven't got that faith
[1:18:04] see what i mean amen it takes
[1:18:08] faith to move it here i got a shell that
[1:18:11] i
[1:18:12] hand loaded i know what it'll do by
[1:18:14] ballistics like the word
[1:18:16] but i've got to fire the gun
[1:18:20] the fire has to get to the powder the
[1:18:22] powder's got the power that's got to
[1:18:24] have the fire to light off
[1:18:26] and the same thing that powers in the
[1:18:28] shell
[1:18:29] but it needs bait to charge it
[1:18:33] and throw it out that's what it takes
[1:18:37] the perfect faith to ignite the power of
[1:18:41] the holy spirit which we have now
[1:18:43] since he's come upon us ever faith to
[1:18:45] ignite
[1:18:47] to see great things
[1:18:50] to the faith something that presents it
[1:18:53] to you
[1:18:54] or the heart full of joy you walk into
[1:18:56] the stick room knowing exactly what
[1:18:58] you're going to say
[1:19:00] know what's going to happen something's
[1:19:01] already been revealed
[1:19:03] and you know it when you walk in in the
[1:19:05] name of jesus christ rise up from there
[1:19:08] say unto the lord there you are that's a
[1:19:11] perfect faith
[1:19:13] if there's these 10 million people
[1:19:15] standing wouldn't happen you know what's
[1:19:16] going to happen anyhow
[1:19:18] because you know it it's going to happen
[1:19:21] regardless what anybody else says you're
[1:19:23] the ones got the faith
[1:19:25] could you imagine joshua he called the
[1:19:29] elders of israel together and said
[1:19:31] uh brethren we are the servants of the
[1:19:34] lord
[1:19:34] i would like for you to say uh ask the
[1:19:37] lord if it'd be all right
[1:19:39] if uh if he'd give us a little more
[1:19:40] sunlight see
[1:19:42] and hold his son a little while no
[1:19:45] he has need of it and without prayer
[1:19:48] without anything he had need of it and
[1:19:51] he just commanded the son
[1:19:54] he said stand there i
[1:19:58] have need and i'm in the service of the
[1:20:01] lord
[1:20:02] and he sent me over here to do this job
[1:20:05] and i'm doing the best i don't know how
[1:20:07] and the enemy is routed
[1:20:09] and they're out in here if i let the sun
[1:20:11] go down they'll get together and cause
[1:20:12] me more trouble so stand still
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:16] moon
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:20:23] now if the world's turning it holds it
[1:20:25] up and the sun stays in the place and it
[1:20:27] don't run
[1:20:28] what happened then amen now you make
[1:20:32] yourself a infidel
[1:20:34] if you say of this and then if you don't
[1:20:36] you shouldn't full of science because
[1:20:38] they said the world stop and drop
[1:20:40] from now on if you say god's word's not
[1:20:42] right then you're in for them
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:51] i don't know the mechanics of the holy
[1:20:53] ghost but i know it fell on me
[1:20:55] i can't tell the mechanics of it but i
[1:20:57] know the blessings of it
[1:21:00] is the blessing of the holy ghost and it
[1:21:03] mechanically works that much is
[1:21:05] secret this lord cannot be healed
[1:21:08] because the disciples had power
[1:21:10] jesus gave them power to heal all manner
[1:21:12] of sickness
[1:21:13] to cast out devils to cleanse the
[1:21:15] efforts and to raise the dead
[1:21:17] and he gave them power but they didn't
[1:21:21] have faith to operate the power that
[1:21:23] they had
[1:21:24] and then they questioned jesus and said
[1:21:26] well now why couldn't we do it
[1:21:28] now remember they had the word
[1:21:31] and the word was flesh down and the word
[1:21:35] told them i give you power heaven
[1:21:40] amen i
[1:21:42] give you power and they had the power
[1:21:46] but they didn't have faith to operate
[1:21:48] the word that was in them
[1:21:50] amen see what i mean but
[1:21:54] jesus had it he was the word
[1:21:58] and he had faith that what he said would
[1:22:00] happen
[1:22:01] and man so bring him here
[1:22:05] how long will he suffer
[1:22:08] he has faith with his power
[1:22:11] how did he he said i can do
[1:22:15] nothing in myself why he relied
[1:22:19] upon what he was
[1:22:23] he relied in knowing that he was the
[1:22:25] word
[1:22:26] and he had faith in god who made him the
[1:22:30] word
[1:22:31] he was god the word and it was in him
[1:22:34] and that giving faith because he
[1:22:36] understood
[1:22:37] his position he knowed what he was
[1:22:40] because the scripture had said
[1:22:42] he was this and here the scripture is
[1:22:45] hiding to prove that he was exactly what
[1:22:47] the scripture
[1:22:48] said he would be and he knew what he was
[1:22:52] therefore he relied upon what
[1:22:55] god had made him amen and if he
[1:22:59] did that then can't we rely upon what
[1:23:02] god made us
[1:23:03] as believers these signs shall
[1:23:06] follow in that belief
[1:23:09] he had faith and what he was
[1:23:13] and if you are a believer you have faith
[1:23:15] in what you are
[1:23:17] you are a believer and if you've got
[1:23:20] faith in god
[1:23:21] the bible says over here and uh if our
[1:23:24] uh if our hearts condemn us
[1:23:27] then we can have faith but if our hearts
[1:23:30] don't condemn us
[1:23:31] then we have faith we have confidence
[1:23:33] towards god
[1:23:34] if you want to read that found saint
[1:23:36] john 3 21. i got the scripture
[1:23:38] written down there my moment then
[1:23:41] i mean first john 3 21 uh notice
[1:23:44] if our hearts condemn us not then we
[1:23:47] have confidence towards god
[1:23:49] but as long as you're doing things
[1:23:51] that's wrong you can't have confidence
[1:23:52] towards god
[1:23:54] so you see you can you automatically
[1:23:57] know that you're wrong
[1:23:59] you're already not going to put yourself
[1:24:00] back here a sinner
[1:24:02] by knowing that you're wrong but when
[1:24:04] your heart don't condemn you and you
[1:24:06] know you are a believer
[1:24:08] and there's nothing between you and god
[1:24:10] because that's what you will
[1:24:12] and know that it will be given because
[1:24:14] it's the word that's given to you
[1:24:16] just like it was to those disciples now
[1:24:18] the only thing you have to do then
[1:24:19] is have faith in what you are
[1:24:23] and have faith in what the word says you
[1:24:26] are
[1:24:27] and jesus had faith in the word of god
[1:24:29] that says what he was
[1:24:30] it is written of me didn't david and the
[1:24:34] psalms and the prophets and all of them
[1:24:35] speak of him i
[1:24:36] am the bread of life that come from god
[1:24:38] out of heaven
[1:24:39] amen i am the tree of life from
[1:24:43] the garden of eden i have all these
[1:24:45] things
[1:24:46] i am that i am and he knew
[1:24:49] that a perfect faith that he was the
[1:24:51] unknown messiah
[1:24:52] that the spirit of god was upon him
[1:24:56] he said now i myself do nothing but it's
[1:24:58] my faith in god
[1:25:00] and god presenting the word made
[1:25:02] manifest and when the word of god comes
[1:25:04] in you it's made manifest
[1:25:06] or you are a believer see and a believer
[1:25:10] is the faith of god that moves in you
[1:25:13] you like that
[1:25:14] i like when you all right before the
[1:25:18] how to what faith really is knowing who
[1:25:21] he was
[1:25:22] without a shadow doubt he knew he was
[1:25:25] the son of god
[1:25:27] he knew it for the word
[1:25:31] identified the word of god identified
[1:25:35] who he was he said if i do not the worst
[1:25:38] of my father then don't believe me
[1:25:40] but if if i don't do them works don't
[1:25:42] believe me but if i do
[1:25:44] then believe the worst for they are the
[1:25:47] manifested word prompt
[1:25:49] or if you just wake up to that you see
[1:25:54] the word itself identified who you are
[1:25:58] and he said who can condemn me and stand
[1:26:01] in other words who can show me that my
[1:26:04] life
[1:26:05] and my works don't fulfill exactly what
[1:26:07] messiah should do
[1:26:10] nobody could say nothing for he was
[1:26:13] then he had faith to believe that
[1:26:15] whatever he said it would happen
[1:26:17] then he turned around and said the works
[1:26:19] that i do show you also
[1:26:20] a little while the world sees me more
[1:26:22] yet you shall because i'll be with you
[1:26:24] even in you
[1:26:26] take no thought once you shall save for
[1:26:27] it's not you to speak
[1:26:29] it's that father that dwells in you he's
[1:26:31] the one doesn't speak
[1:26:33] it's not me it's the father that dwells
[1:26:34] in me he doeth the word
[1:26:38] see what i mean now the identification
[1:26:42] of a scripture christian these words
[1:26:45] said
[1:26:46] jesus these signs shall follow them i
[1:26:49] believe
[1:26:50] now how can you call yourself a believer
[1:26:53] of people
[1:26:54] and deny those words how can you call
[1:26:57] yourself a believer
[1:26:59] and deny any of this one right you can't
[1:27:02] do it
[1:27:03] you're not a believer therefore signs
[1:27:05] can't follow
[1:27:06] because you just accept what you want to
[1:27:08] believe and that the rest of it you want
[1:27:10] don't believe
[1:27:11] but you've got to take the whole thing
[1:27:13] and believe that amen and when you truly
[1:27:15] believe not make believe but really
[1:27:17] believe
[1:27:17] then these signs follow them they
[1:27:19] believe oh
[1:27:21] could you compare christians today with
[1:27:22] them christians of long ago
[1:27:24] how them disciples walked in the power
[1:27:26] of the spirit
[1:27:27] moved by the holy ghost to go just a
[1:27:30] prisoner as i preached on the other
[1:27:31] night a prisoner to the word and will of
[1:27:33] god
[1:27:34] he couldn't even move until god moved
[1:27:36] wouldn't you like to see a church rise
[1:27:38] like that
[1:27:40] it's going to go back
[1:27:44] it's got
[1:27:51] identifies himself what he was
[1:27:54] and the same word identifies us
[1:27:59] if a man loves me he keeps my
[1:28:01] commandments
[1:28:02] and if he says he loves me keeps not my
[1:28:04] commandments that's all of me
[1:28:06] he's alive amen and the truth's not even
[1:28:08] anymore
[1:28:09] you say well i don't believe well then
[1:28:11] that you're just not a believer that's
[1:28:13] all
[1:28:13] if the bible said so that makes it right
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:18] what the bible says is the truth notice
[1:28:22] or he said to us if you abide me in my
[1:28:25] wording you think john 15
[1:28:27] you're here by me see and faith in him
[1:28:31] give by me and my word abides in you
[1:28:35] then you ask what you will
[1:28:39] now see he knew who he was therefore he
[1:28:42] had faith
[1:28:44] faith could produce when he knows what
[1:28:46] he was now if he abides me and my word
[1:28:48] in you then you know where you are
[1:28:51] amen that's what you will it'll be given
[1:28:54] to you
[1:28:55] wouldn't that be a wonderful night if
[1:28:56] everybody come to that prayer line and
[1:28:57] say i am a christian
[1:28:59] i have no condemnation i i know that my
[1:29:03] heart can then
[1:29:04] something tells me that the night's the
[1:29:06] end of my suffering
[1:29:07] amen
[1:29:10] no matter how much you come in emotion
[1:29:12] how much you do it won't work until
[1:29:14] that perfect faith has manifested and
[1:29:17] identified itself in you as the
[1:29:18] substance
[1:29:19] and when it's there then nothing's going
[1:29:21] to shake you from it
[1:29:23] if if you had cancer and the doctor told
[1:29:26] you
[1:29:26] yesterday that you'd be dead before
[1:29:31] i hope you noticed that little part
[1:29:35] in there that kept coming up who you are
[1:29:40] but not only who you are what you are
[1:29:43] what you are what you are
[1:29:47] and you and he said can't you believe
[1:29:51] what god made him he knew who he was he
[1:29:54] knew
[1:29:54] what he was he knew what the scripture
[1:29:58] said about him so we also see and this
[1:30:01] is the things that
[1:30:04] that were we're trying to
[1:30:07] to uh drive to listen
[1:30:11] listen this last little part he says
[1:30:18] he says oh could you compare a christian
[1:30:21] today
[1:30:22] with them christians of long ago
[1:30:26] now that's a good question and a good
[1:30:30] challenge
[1:30:30] so that's what we we got to see see
[1:30:33] we're talking about
[1:30:34] positioning ourselves what it's going to
[1:30:37] take
[1:30:38] so we know that this is promised to us
[1:30:42] because if it doesn't happen
[1:30:45] then there never was a restoration
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:55] no matter how much you want to say
[1:31:01] the works identified brother branham's
[1:31:05] works
[1:31:06] identified him as the messenger
[1:31:12] it vindicated what he said
[1:31:15] that what he was and what he fulfilled
[1:31:22] but you are the identification
[1:31:25] of the restoration
[1:31:30] you understand there's a part of the
[1:31:32] word that you identify
[1:31:34] there's a part of the word that you
[1:31:36] fulfill look he said let's compare the
[1:31:39] church
[1:31:42] so we say restoration brother bran
[1:31:44] preach restoration
[1:31:45] the faith of the fathers and we say he
[1:31:48] did this miracle he did that miracle he
[1:31:51] did that miracle he did that miracle
[1:31:54] that vindicates him there's nobody
[1:31:59] can doubt that william branham was a
[1:32:03] prophet
[1:32:04] now some might not believe he was a true
[1:32:06] prophet but he was a prophet
[1:32:10] he did the works of a prophet he
[1:32:12] prophesied of a prophet
[1:32:13] there's not one time he ever said thus
[1:32:16] saith the lord that it failed
[1:32:18] that vindicated him
[1:32:21] and it vindicated the word that he
[1:32:24] preached
[1:32:30] but you are the manifestation of the
[1:32:33] message
[1:32:38] if you believe the message
[1:32:45] if you believe what he said about a
[1:32:47] church
[1:32:48] if you believe what he said about the
[1:32:51] promise
[1:32:52] if you believe it not
[1:32:56] agree that it's the truth but you're
[1:32:59] willing to
[1:33:00] let that go through all doubts
[1:33:03] all confusions all voices
[1:33:06] and let it drop into the bedding ground
[1:33:09] of that heart
[1:33:10] to where it brings forth the fruit
[1:33:16] that's what we want look let's just go
[1:33:19] over the promise again
[1:33:23] how them disciples walked in the power
[1:33:25] of the spirit
[1:33:27] moved by the holy spirit to do it
[1:33:31] just a prisoner as i preached the other
[1:33:34] night
[1:33:35] a prisoner to the word and will of god
[1:33:39] he couldn't even move until god moved
[1:33:42] them
[1:33:43] wouldn't you like to see a church rise
[1:33:47] like that
[1:33:51] first question
[1:33:55] wouldn't you like to see a church like
[1:33:59] that come back
[1:34:02] wouldn't you like to see if your loved
[1:34:04] one
[1:34:05] a family member an uncle and aunt was
[1:34:08] given to alcohol
[1:34:10] or something wouldn't you love to have a
[1:34:12] church
[1:34:14] amen no people that could make a
[1:34:17] difference
[1:34:18] if the devil had intellectually gone out
[1:34:22] and sowed all kinds of confusion
[1:34:26] to the mind
[1:34:29] now i want you to understand this a lot
[1:34:33] of people
[1:34:33] out there agreed in their mind
[1:34:39] but they never took it
[1:34:43] to expression
[1:34:48] you understand they never took it to
[1:34:51] works or to the expression
[1:34:55] of what was there it never dropped into
[1:34:58] the bedding ground of their heart
[1:35:00] to produce faith
[1:35:03] because remember once it hits that
[1:35:06] bedding ground
[1:35:07] it can never be moved
[1:35:10] but as long as it's in their head
[1:35:16] and you can't blame them because the
[1:35:19] church has been living at nine o'clock
[1:35:22] so long that they got tired of nine
[1:35:24] o'clock
[1:35:25] and now the critic came up and said
[1:35:27] you're still at nine o'clock you're
[1:35:29] still at nine o'clock
[1:35:30] look this didn't happen brother branham
[1:35:32] didn't tell the proof
[1:35:33] that was a rocket ship and there's no
[1:35:35] newspaper that says
[1:35:37] anybody fell off of the fell off of the
[1:35:40] bridge and
[1:35:41] you know he just made that up and such
[1:35:44] and such didn't get well
[1:35:45] and on and on and on they go
[1:35:49] but your evidence
[1:35:52] isn't in his vindication your evidence
[1:35:55] is in your vindication
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:04] i know because i've tasted of the
[1:36:08] restoration
[1:36:11] what he talked about lives
[1:36:18] then they don't have to look in an old
[1:36:20] newspaper they don't have to look at a
[1:36:22] history
[1:36:23] they don't have to look at a scot they
[1:36:25] see the word
[1:36:26] they manifest in flash
[1:36:29] [Applause]
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:37] there's a reason for it now
[1:36:42] there's a reason he said take it to the
[1:36:44] public
[1:36:47] take it to the hall of critics
[1:36:55] take it to the proving station
[1:37:02] i can say it's gold
[1:37:07] well how would you like to have a bucket
[1:37:08] full of fool's gold
[1:37:13] how'd you like to haul these years been
[1:37:15] buying fool's gold
[1:37:17] i started collecting silver dollars
[1:37:21] and i thought i'm pretty good at serving
[1:37:23] one day a guy said something that just
[1:37:25] shook
[1:37:25] my boots he said you got to be careful
[1:37:28] there's a lot of fakes out there
[1:37:34] i mean i could have bought a fake one
[1:37:39] i didn't buy anything after that that
[1:37:41] wasn't certified
[1:37:51] that's genuine anybody can say it
[1:37:58] okay you understand there's a reason
[1:38:03] i hope i can just we're just going to
[1:38:06] sing tonight
[1:38:09] okay we're going to have hallelujah time
[1:38:13] everybody go home and drink tea and
[1:38:15] honey
[1:38:18] he said wouldn't you like to see a
[1:38:20] church rise
[1:38:21] like that it's going to
[1:38:26] it's going back
[1:38:29] it's got to
[1:38:32] come that's right it's
[1:38:35] on its road now
[1:38:38] i believe hello
[1:38:44] there's a prophet
[1:38:47] he said it's on its road now when he
[1:38:49] says it's on its road
[1:38:51] don't get all upset that it's been 50
[1:38:53] years
[1:38:54] isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[1:38:57] 800 years on the road but
[1:39:00] it got there
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:05] you can't tell me this church is here
[1:39:11] now it springs up like that little lady
[1:39:15] that
[1:39:15] had lost all her hair i love her
[1:39:17] testimony
[1:39:20] and they prayed for her one day she
[1:39:22] pulled her cap off there's a little old
[1:39:23] crop of hair
[1:39:25] now she's got long beautiful hair why
[1:39:27] because jesus christ is the same
[1:39:28] yesterday
[1:39:30] and she dared to believe what god said
[1:39:36] they're scattered testimonies
[1:39:39] you understand but it's not about
[1:39:41] somebody else
[1:39:43] it's about when you get to the place he
[1:39:45] said what he's done for others
[1:39:47] he can do for me
[1:39:53] so it's on its way it's coming
[1:39:58] we've got to believe that do you believe
[1:40:01] that
[1:40:02] so why did he say faith is built is
[1:40:05] based on
[1:40:06] forgiveness what's the first step of a
[1:40:10] believer's journey
[1:40:12] justification
[1:40:16] you can because he forgave you
[1:40:21] what's the second step
[1:40:25] sanctification that's where the body's
[1:40:28] having its trouble
[1:40:36] that's where our problem is that's where
[1:40:38] my problem is that's where it's all our
[1:40:40] problems
[1:40:41] is when we know we're not doing right
[1:40:44] our heart condemns us
[1:40:49] but you got to know this if he's justful
[1:40:52] and faithful to forgive your sins
[1:40:55] if you'll confess them
[1:40:59] don't try to walk out under the painted
[1:41:02] blood covering
[1:41:04] and try to display your own
[1:41:06] righteousness
[1:41:10] do you think god don't seek everything
[1:41:13] that we
[1:41:13] are the only reason he doesn't wipe us
[1:41:17] out
[1:41:17] because he loves us
[1:41:21] he loves us so much he gave his only
[1:41:23] begotten son
[1:41:25] that through his blood our sins could be
[1:41:28] covered and forgiven if we're faithful
[1:41:31] and just to confess our sins
[1:41:33] he's faithful and just to forgive them
[1:41:36] don't sit on your wrongdoing get down
[1:41:39] before
[1:41:40] god and start confessing your sins and
[1:41:43] making your life right
[1:41:48] because he wants to empower you he
[1:41:51] promised he would empower you
[1:41:55] and after justification
[1:41:58] there's sanctification
[1:42:02] he provides the power
[1:42:05] to overcome that's right
[1:42:09] don't you see the wisdom of god he said
[1:42:12] though by the wisdom of god
[1:42:14] god made it that you couldn't know him
[1:42:16] by wisdom
[1:42:18] god no he said i don't know the
[1:42:20] mechanics of it
[1:42:21] i just know that i've got it that felt
[1:42:25] me but look at the wisdom of god
[1:42:27] first of all he let you experience
[1:42:29] justification
[1:42:32] so if you know that he forgive your sins
[1:42:35] that same
[1:42:36] justifying power is what helps you
[1:42:39] sanctify your life
[1:42:44] the same faith that justified you
[1:42:48] the same blood that justifies you the
[1:42:50] same blood that sanctifies you
[1:42:52] but what do we go do we all go try to
[1:42:55] sanctify ourselves
[1:43:00] and therefore we don't spend no time
[1:43:02] with them
[1:43:03] we don't spend no time reading we don't
[1:43:06] get
[1:43:06] in the spirit
[1:43:10] there's nothing like getting in the
[1:43:12] spirit there's nothing like
[1:43:14] raising your hands and just getting lost
[1:43:17] in the spirit
[1:43:19] you know i come up with a bunch of
[1:43:21] hippies you know that believed in the
[1:43:22] lord but i'll tell you one thing we
[1:43:24] could do we could get in the spirit
[1:43:28] we'd all get together and say you know
[1:43:31] that we are
[1:43:32] christians by our love by our love
[1:43:36] oh you'll know that we are christians by
[1:43:39] our love
[1:43:41] and unknown pretty soon we are floating
[1:43:45] we were worshiping the lord we had
[1:43:47] visions of his goodness
[1:43:49] in our eyes you know we are doing we are
[1:43:52] opening the door
[1:43:54] for transforming power we are opening
[1:43:57] the door
[1:43:57] for him to come in and bring us under
[1:43:59] conviction and give us revelation
[1:44:04] you've got to get past the intellectual
[1:44:08] amen to the word and say lord i want
[1:44:12] what's there
[1:44:12] to drop into a betting ground where it
[1:44:15] can be expressed
[1:44:18] but so he does justification so you can
[1:44:21] understand the working power of
[1:44:23] sanctification
[1:44:25] and then once you've experienced
[1:44:28] sanctification
[1:44:30] it moves you in because by experience
[1:44:32] you've experienced it
[1:44:35] you know it's real it's the lion it's
[1:44:38] the bear
[1:44:40] so now you can come and meet the giant
[1:44:46] now you can know you can be glorified
[1:44:49] not you glorified but him glorified
[1:44:53] in you because you saw him do
[1:44:56] sanctification
[1:44:57] you saw him do justification now you
[1:45:00] based on those two experiences you're
[1:45:03] willing to take on the goliath
[1:45:06] and manifest the power of resurrection
[1:45:13] but if you got a crack in those
[1:45:18] so no wonder satan tempts us so bad
[1:45:23] have you ever seen an age when there's
[1:45:26] so much sin
[1:45:27] at a press of a button
[1:45:30] you better not do a computer search and
[1:45:33] misspell a word
[1:45:41] i advise
[1:45:44] as your pastor separate yourself
[1:45:48] from social media
[1:45:54] just my advice
[1:46:02] the stuff i've seen on social media
[1:46:05] is unbelievable
[1:46:08] people make comments that they don't
[1:46:10] even realize
[1:46:12] and they've been permanently placed in
[1:46:14] there
[1:46:15] i've got enough bad stuff on the record
[1:46:18] that i'm writing in heaven
[1:46:21] not enough to have all kinds of people
[1:46:23] in the world
[1:46:24] bearing witness
[1:46:29] i don't know nothing about facebook
[1:46:34] but i only want one face on my book
[1:46:42] i don't know nothing about twitter
[1:46:46] tweeter all i know it's a spirit feeder
[1:46:58] you know people text me and i don't
[1:47:01] answer their text for for five days
[1:47:04] and they come to why text you call me
[1:47:10] i don't want a secondhand revelation i
[1:47:13] don't want something that i have to
[1:47:14] interpret
[1:47:15] give me the experience
[1:47:23] can you imagine jesus text you from
[1:47:25] heaven you've been justified
[1:47:29] no
[1:47:34] so we we can't understand he's done that
[1:47:38] now this is why
[1:47:42] it
[1:47:46] strikes me because this is what the
[1:47:49] prophet of god
[1:47:52] says he's talking about
[1:47:56] this faith he's talking about
[1:48:01] this place that you come to
[1:48:04] that you don't consider anything else
[1:48:07] but the word of god and he makes this
[1:48:11] comment in regards to that
[1:48:14] he says when a man lives by faith
[1:48:18] and walks by faith
[1:48:22] so we we we've we've
[1:48:25] gone through that so we already we've
[1:48:27] got the definition
[1:48:29] of faith now is a man
[1:48:32] that believes what
[1:48:35] that he is
[1:48:39] what that god made him
[1:48:43] your faith is not based on the
[1:48:46] intellectual mind that says that
[1:48:50] it's true
[1:48:53] your faith is built on
[1:48:57] as he as he said here
[1:49:00] he says when the word of god comes in
[1:49:03] you
[1:49:04] it's manifested it manifests
[1:49:08] as you are a believer
[1:49:12] when the word of god comes to you it
[1:49:15] manifests
[1:49:16] that you are a believer the word didn't
[1:49:19] come to you
[1:49:20] for your intellectual vain
[1:49:23] acknowledgement
[1:49:24] that it's truth satan believes that
[1:49:29] and he fears and trembles the word of
[1:49:31] god came to you we preached it last week
[1:49:34] is to manifest to you that you are
[1:49:37] a believer
[1:49:42] if you don't accept that you're stuck at
[1:49:46] nine o'clock
[1:49:51] you don't have the power
[1:49:55] you believe it but you don't got the
[1:49:58] faith
[1:49:59] to operate the power he gave you
[1:50:03] where does the faith come to operate the
[1:50:06] power
[1:50:07] when you recognize what
[1:50:11] you are
[1:50:18] when you recognize yourself i'm a
[1:50:20] believer
[1:50:21] i believe this now listen what he says
[1:50:24] faith is
[1:50:26] he says as you are a believer and a
[1:50:29] believer
[1:50:30] is the faith of god that
[1:50:33] moves in you
[1:50:38] now so he's telling us we've
[1:50:42] majored am i am i
[1:50:46] like screaming am i okay
[1:50:50] i feel like i'm yelling at you
[1:50:54] but we've majored
[1:50:57] in the faith as being that intellectual
[1:51:01] part of us that says it's true
[1:51:03] it's true it's true it never came for us
[1:51:06] to acknowledge it was true
[1:51:08] it was true before ever god didn't need
[1:51:11] you to say it was true
[1:51:14] he sent it so that you would understand
[1:51:17] that that seed that's in you said amen
[1:51:21] i believe it's true here but now i want
[1:51:24] it to drop into the bedding ground
[1:51:26] of expression
[1:51:31] because works is faith expressed
[1:51:39] so he says this okay
[1:51:42] and you heard him you heard him say this
[1:51:46] he said let me find it right here
[1:51:56] he says here i've got a shell that i
[1:52:00] hand loaded
[1:52:02] i know what it
[1:52:05] i know what it'll do by ballistics
[1:52:10] like the word
[1:52:14] so he says here's his bullet
[1:52:18] he said this bullet will travel at 3 000
[1:52:21] pounds per second
[1:52:24] it'll carry 150 grain bullet
[1:52:28] 200 yards flat it'll fall
[1:52:32] 50 feet for every so many feet
[1:52:36] it's got the ballistics how much barrel
[1:52:38] pressure how much
[1:52:40] everything he said i know that by
[1:52:43] the word that's like the word we know
[1:52:45] that by the word
[1:52:47] we know the ballistics everybody in this
[1:52:49] message
[1:52:50] knows the ballistics here's what we're
[1:52:53] not doing
[1:52:56] he says he said i i handle
[1:52:59] i know what it'll do by the ballistics
[1:53:01] like the word but
[1:53:02] i've got to fire the gun
[1:53:11] i've got to pull the trigger
[1:53:17] we've got all this power that's given us
[1:53:20] we got all the ballistics we're
[1:53:22] ballistic experts
[1:53:27] we know every quote but what we're not
[1:53:30] doing is we're not firing the gun so
[1:53:33] you've got a sick person that's here
[1:53:37] god's a healer god's a healer god's a
[1:53:39] healer god healed this one
[1:53:41] you got to go fire the gun lay your
[1:53:45] hands on the sick
[1:53:46] and they shall recover
[1:53:51] it's got to be expressed
[1:53:56] sometime
[1:53:59] who are you that's the question who's
[1:54:04] sitting here this morning
[1:54:06] i just wrote down a few things and i'm
[1:54:08] going to try to close because i think
[1:54:10] this is something that i can just go on
[1:54:11] forever
[1:54:14] because it's rich it's coming to me and
[1:54:16] say what are you going to get out of
[1:54:18] this brother mcgary
[1:54:19] the first thing i'm getting out of this
[1:54:20] is i'm going to start sanctifying my
[1:54:22] life
[1:54:25] i'm tired of wrong coming up and me
[1:54:28] knowing i'm wrong
[1:54:34] brother brown went to pray for somebody
[1:54:35] and just a little
[1:54:37] bothered him so what are you gonna do
[1:54:41] about old man i'm gonna put him under
[1:54:42] the blood
[1:54:45] i'm gonna bring him back under the blood
[1:54:51] and then i'm going to start trying to
[1:54:54] live upright
[1:54:56] and then i'm going to recognize that
[1:54:57] i've got a call
[1:55:04] do you all know you got a call this is
[1:55:06] what paul said
[1:55:08] for you see your calling
[1:55:11] brethren amen
[1:55:14] how not many wise men
[1:55:18] after the flesh not many mighty men
[1:55:22] not many noble men are called
[1:55:26] but he's chosen you amen
[1:55:32] do you see your calling he's got a
[1:55:34] calling
[1:55:35] and so we now we see that faith
[1:55:39] is not the intellectual acknowledgement
[1:55:41] of the word
[1:55:42] but faith comes down to the word has
[1:55:45] sent
[1:55:46] so you know what you are
[1:55:50] what you are what did he
[1:55:53] place in this last stage
[1:55:57] in perfect faith god said in
[1:56:00] every age god has a promise for that age
[1:56:04] then he predestinates somebody
[1:56:07] there to meet that promise and bring it
[1:56:10] to pass
[1:56:14] that message is called proving his word
[1:56:19] so you who you are
[1:56:23] what you are is the provers
[1:56:28] of god's word
[1:56:32] you're the elected chosen people
[1:56:36] that are elected
[1:56:39] created and made
[1:56:44] to express the restoration
[1:56:48] of the faith of the fathers
[1:56:53] it's been on its road
[1:56:57] we saw it at the door
[1:57:00] but now it's coming because it's got to
[1:57:03] come
[1:57:04] and it's going to come so this is what
[1:57:07] this is where our perfect faith comes
[1:57:09] from it's not the perfect faith in the
[1:57:12] word
[1:57:14] it's the faith that you are the
[1:57:17] manifestation
[1:57:18] of that word abraham
[1:57:22] didn't consider his body being dead he
[1:57:25] didn't consider
[1:57:26] abraham sarah's body being dead
[1:57:29] he didn't consider everything that's
[1:57:31] what the prophet of god said
[1:57:32] to resist the devil means to walk away
[1:57:36] not to consider he didn't consider
[1:57:39] anything
[1:57:40] he considered what god said
[1:57:46] he said god chose me to be the father of
[1:57:50] many nations
[1:57:52] and that the heir to salvation
[1:57:55] is going to come and abraham
[1:57:58] believed what god told them
[1:58:04] now when are we
[1:58:08] listen what brother brahm says what are
[1:58:11] we
[1:58:12] we are the children of abraham
[1:58:16] hallelujah not as isaac was
[1:58:21] but his royal seed
[1:58:27] in other words not the natural seed of
[1:58:29] abraham not all israel is israel
[1:58:32] but the royal sea
[1:58:35] we are the faith seed
[1:58:38] of abraham we are the possessors
[1:58:42] of the same faith that abraham had
[1:58:52] anybody believe that about yourself okay
[1:58:55] so what did we hear this morning we got
[1:58:58] to start putting that faith in the gun
[1:59:00] we start got to start firing it
[1:59:05] we are the children of abraham
[1:59:07] hallelujah not as isaac was but the
[1:59:09] royal seed
[1:59:10] through christ jesus by the faith
[1:59:14] that he had abraham's seed
[1:59:19] coming forth in the last days
[1:59:22] to shine like the stars
[1:59:26] abraham's children
[1:59:30] considering not his own body now dead
[1:59:33] neither considering it was even brought
[1:59:36] into question
[1:59:37] whether god would do it or not god said
[1:59:41] he would do it why it was a revelation
[1:59:45] to him
[1:59:46] that's right when it's revealed to you
[1:59:52] when it when you can make
[1:59:55] you can't make it happen it's got to be
[1:59:59] revealed to you then you don't even
[2:00:02] consider
[2:00:03] anything else how impossible it is
[2:00:07] don't consider what the doctor said
[2:00:09] don't consider what mama said
[2:00:11] or what papa said or what the preacher
[2:00:14] says
[2:00:15] it's it's what anybody else
[2:00:19] could say it's just considered what god
[2:00:23] said amen and can
[2:00:26] and that's what he said he says he said
[2:00:29] when you get there
[2:00:31] i like to read this statement again
[2:00:34] when he says when you get there he says
[2:00:36] i mean the substance of faith
[2:00:38] he's isolated from the total world and
[2:00:40] becomes a new creature in christ jesus
[2:00:43] and there now you're getting into bride
[2:00:46] material
[2:00:47] see you're getting into rapturing
[2:00:50] condition
[2:00:51] now now the bride's got to lift itself
[2:00:54] up by the boots it's got to get
[2:00:58] in rapturing condition
[2:01:03] so why is it important
[2:01:07] that this church takes on the faith
[2:01:14] of the fathers
[2:01:17] and begins to express it and fire the
[2:01:21] gun
[2:01:22] and have the apostolic power
[2:01:26] moving in their midst flowing
[2:01:29] out to others why is that
[2:01:33] important that this resurrection
[2:01:37] power in life is manifested to the
[2:01:41] believer
[2:01:44] and this restoration comes
[2:01:47] because that is what produces
[2:01:51] rapturing faith
[2:01:56] because without the works your faith is
[2:02:00] dead
[2:02:02] in other words if this church isn't
[2:02:04] carrying out
[2:02:06] and manifesting the faith of the
[2:02:09] disciples
[2:02:11] of the apostles our fathers if it's not
[2:02:14] shooting the gun
[2:02:16] if it's not going into all the world
[2:02:18] preaching the gospel
[2:02:20] if it's not expressing what it believes
[2:02:25] it's not in rapturing condition
[2:02:29] so the very substance
[2:02:35] of our rapture lies
[2:02:38] in the manifestation of the promised
[2:02:42] word in our lives recognizing
[2:02:46] what we are and what are you
[2:02:50] you are the children of abraham the
[2:02:53] royal seed
[2:02:54] you have the fame faith that he did to
[2:02:57] believe
[2:02:58] the impossible and not consider anybody
[2:03:02] else
[2:03:02] that's what you are
[2:03:08] let that drop into your heart
[2:03:12] what are you you are the possessors
[2:03:17] of eternal life that's what you are
[2:03:25] if you had eternal life you always had
[2:03:29] eternal life why would he tell you that
[2:03:35] because you were going to need it
[2:03:39] to fulfill the commission
[2:03:43] of the apostolic move of the spirit
[2:03:46] and perfect faith manifested in your
[2:03:48] flesh
[2:03:49] because without that perfect faith and
[2:03:52] without that perfect love
[2:03:54] you will not be apart
[2:04:02] you won't have the faith the rapture in
[2:04:06] faith was contained in the revelations
[2:04:08] of the seventh seal
[2:04:09] and the third poll i mean we can go back
[2:04:11] to the history of it
[2:04:15] but the word was delivered to us
[2:04:19] specifically telling us
[2:04:23] that we are that these signs
[2:04:26] will follow them that believe
[2:04:32] that's right not believe in the promise
[2:04:37] that he gave to the disciples
[2:04:41] not based on that promise
[2:04:44] of a reproduction
[2:04:47] but based on the faith that i've been
[2:04:50] called to be the restorer of that
[2:04:54] i've been called but that's produced in
[2:04:57] me it's the promise
[2:04:59] for my day in me i'm not trying to
[2:05:02] duplicate that
[2:05:03] i'm not going back there that promise
[2:05:06] didn't bring me back
[2:05:07] it brought the promise to me today
[2:05:14] he restored it back
[2:05:17] he sent a prophet to go back and get it
[2:05:25] and bring it to the elected
[2:05:29] that's called here and say this is what
[2:05:33] you are
[2:05:34] you are the person
[2:05:37] that i've elected
[2:05:40] to fulfill this
[2:05:45] don't have nothing to do with the
[2:05:46] history
[2:05:49] he's raised up out of history
[2:05:52] he's a living god what are you
[2:05:59] you are the carriers of the light
[2:06:07] it shall be light in the evening time
[2:06:10] the path to glory you shall surely find
[2:06:13] you
[2:06:14] are the carriers of the light
[2:06:17] you have the light no man light at the
[2:06:20] candle
[2:06:21] and set it under a bushel basket but he
[2:06:24] sets the light on the whole hill
[2:06:27] i'm wearing you out but i'm going to
[2:06:28] keep going so i can have rest
[2:06:31] in my spirit
[2:06:35] he was the light
[2:06:38] the world don't know the way but you
[2:06:41] know the way
[2:06:42] that's you're the light you are the
[2:06:45] light
[2:06:48] yes amen
[2:06:51] you are the word the bride and the
[2:06:54] bridegroom become one
[2:06:56] we've heard all these things every
[2:06:58] single one of them is who you are
[2:07:00] what you are you are the light that's
[2:07:02] what you
[2:07:03] are you are the light oh if you could
[2:07:05] just look in the mirror and say i am the
[2:07:07] light
[2:07:08] i am eternal life this is what i am
[2:07:12] this is what he made me can't you
[2:07:14] believe what god made you
[2:07:16] can't you believe who you are can't you
[2:07:19] accept the fact that he elected you and
[2:07:21] called you
[2:07:22] to fulfill the commission of the
[2:07:25] restoration
[2:07:26] of the church somebody's got it
[2:07:30] somewhere
[2:07:33] why can't it be us why can't it be you
[2:07:38] why can't it be me
[2:07:41] amen i believe it is
[2:07:44] amen just kill one or two people
[2:07:55] you are the carriers of the light
[2:08:02] to let people see
[2:08:07] nobody can see without the light
[2:08:11] the world is lost in gross darkness
[2:08:15] but it shall be light in the evening
[2:08:18] time
[2:08:19] where is that light
[2:08:23] they'll never read this book until they
[2:08:26] see the light in you
[2:08:30] they'll never be moved
[2:08:33] until there's something that comes from
[2:08:35] you to move them
[2:08:37] but that's what you are you
[2:08:40] are the light he created you to be the
[2:08:43] light
[2:08:44] this is what he said you were you well
[2:08:47] that's what you are you're the carry
[2:08:48] carrier
[2:08:49] you are the voice of truth
[2:08:54] you are the voice
[2:08:58] the voice of the bride in the last day
[2:09:01] she's the voice of god
[2:09:03] you are the voice there's not another
[2:09:06] voice
[2:09:10] without you if you read the first thing
[2:09:14] in
[2:09:14] first corinthians he said i would that
[2:09:16] you'd be of all like mind
[2:09:18] i would that you would all say the same
[2:09:20] thing i would that you all have the same
[2:09:22] care
[2:09:23] one for another hallelujah
[2:09:27] you are the voice
[2:09:34] this is a living voice
[2:09:37] that's just like saying jesus
[2:09:40] was the voice i'm not going to listen to
[2:09:44] nothing else
[2:09:45] but just jesus good
[2:09:48] luck
[2:09:53] because he didn't ordain it that way
[2:09:56] he ordained it from faith to faith
[2:10:00] the gospel shred spread by faith
[2:10:03] to faith from revelation to revelation
[2:10:07] he never took the people out
[2:10:10] and substituted a tape
[2:10:15] you said you played a tape i didn't play
[2:10:17] a historical tape
[2:10:18] i played living word
[2:10:26] divine revelation you
[2:10:29] are the voice of god manifested
[2:10:34] voice you are the voice the bride has
[2:10:36] thus saith the lord
[2:10:37] or she stays still you're the voice
[2:10:40] nobody can hear without you
[2:10:42] you are the voice you are the voice
[2:10:45] you are the light you are eternal life
[2:10:49] you are the possessors you are the royal
[2:10:51] seed of abraham
[2:10:54] that's what god wants you to believe
[2:10:56] that's where the faith anchors
[2:10:58] the faith anchors and what he said you
[2:11:00] are that's what gives you the perfect
[2:11:02] faith
[2:11:06] your sins don't take it away they're
[2:11:08] under the blood
[2:11:10] your righteousness don't approve it
[2:11:12] abraham went out and didn't consider
[2:11:14] anything else
[2:11:15] because god said so
[2:11:20] don't let your mind start judging
[2:11:22] yourself
[2:11:25] paul said i don't even judge myself
[2:11:29] nor will i let any man judge me
[2:11:33] he said so
[2:11:38] you say well if you're not somebody is
[2:11:42] so if you're not i'm going to take it
[2:11:46] amen i'll take your spot
[2:11:49] because if you don't take it
[2:11:52] he will give it to somebody else
[2:11:58] don't think we're going to sit the rest
[2:12:01] of the way through this
[2:12:02] and not pull ourselves up by the
[2:12:05] bootstraps
[2:12:06] and pull ourselves into the presence of
[2:12:08] god
[2:12:10] it's the sign of the real believer
[2:12:14] these signs shall follow them
[2:12:17] that believe you'll never have the signs
[2:12:21] until you believe what
[2:12:25] you are what else are you
[2:12:30] you are the witness of a working
[2:12:34] gospel
[2:12:39] you are the carriers of the commission
[2:12:44] go into all the world and preach the
[2:12:46] gospel
[2:12:48] how many people you think when luther
[2:12:52] said were justified
[2:12:55] by faith still trinitarians
[2:12:59] that you don't have to pay penance you
[2:13:01] don't have to vote
[2:13:02] how many people grabbed that message and
[2:13:05] ran out to their loved ones
[2:13:06] and they preached justification
[2:13:10] how many took wesley's message and ran
[2:13:13] out
[2:13:14] and preached sanctification
[2:13:17] how many have taken the message
[2:13:21] that was delivered through the prophet
[2:13:22] of malachi 4
[2:13:24] 5 luke 17 30
[2:13:27] revelations 10 7 and went out and
[2:13:30] delivered it to the world
[2:13:31] how many can raise their hand this
[2:13:33] morning and count
[2:13:34] five converts on your hand
[2:13:41] you only need one and you'll get the
[2:13:43] other four
[2:13:49] are you ashamed of me before men we're
[2:13:52] talking about rapture
[2:13:53] church we're talking about not playing
[2:13:55] church
[2:13:56] we're talking about a sanctified people
[2:13:59] that believe
[2:14:00] god's word and are putting the bullet
[2:14:02] the word in the gun
[2:14:03] and firing the gun they're taking the
[2:14:06] needle off nine o'clock
[2:14:08] and they're getting back into the battle
[2:14:10] that's what brother branham said in
[2:14:11] standing in the gap
[2:14:12] i'm going back on the field
[2:14:19] i lost the feeling of the people
[2:14:22] then he began to bring that third pole
[2:14:24] message you begin to bring
[2:14:26] the things of god to us
[2:14:32] you can interpret whatever you want or
[2:14:35] what
[2:14:35] riding this trail again but i'll
[2:14:37] guarantee you this message is writing
[2:14:39] right now
[2:14:40] producing that living word of god in
[2:14:43] flesh
[2:14:48] you're the commission you're the
[2:14:51] you are the manifestation of the
[2:14:56] commission
[2:14:57] in this last day to go into all the
[2:14:59] world and preach the gospel
[2:15:01] it is not given to the nickelodeonism
[2:15:08] given to the bride
[2:15:11] you sisters can witness the resurrection
[2:15:15] if it gets to doctrine call your husband
[2:15:18] call your brother if you are not married
[2:15:20] call your pastor they can handle the
[2:15:22] doctrinal side but you are the possessor
[2:15:26] of the life
[2:15:27] you are the possessor of the light you
[2:15:29] are the possessor of the truth
[2:15:32] that's who you are you are the
[2:15:35] administrators
[2:15:37] of the resurrection power
[2:15:46] what does it do have a box of shells
[2:15:51] he's called you you
[2:15:54] are you possess the power of the
[2:15:56] resurrection
[2:15:59] you got the truth you're the voice
[2:16:01] you're all these things manifested in
[2:16:03] flesh
[2:16:04] now why does he need that to go to the
[2:16:06] public
[2:16:09] because if you can't make that real
[2:16:13] you will never make the changing of your
[2:16:16] flesh
[2:16:17] reel
[2:16:23] you won't even be in the place where the
[2:16:25] rapture takes place
[2:16:27] the prophet of god says you've got to
[2:16:29] get here to be in rapturing
[2:16:31] condition
[2:16:34] you can't get in rapturing condition
[2:16:38] hear me it ain't
[2:16:42] i don't care how much you believe this
[2:16:44] message how much you've got revelation
[2:16:47] how much you can split the bride coming
[2:16:50] of christ
[2:16:53] how you can explain the mysteries
[2:16:56] show me your faith without your works
[2:17:00] and i'll show you my faith by my works
[2:17:07] how do we make this confession
[2:17:10] that we're leaving the earth and our
[2:17:14] bodies have been
[2:17:15] changed and we're going to bypass
[2:17:20] the whole step
[2:17:24] of the church manifesting
[2:17:27] and the faith of god of the fathers
[2:17:30] being restored in us
[2:17:32] and these works follow them that believe
[2:17:37] who told us this what
[2:17:41] lying preachers
[2:17:45] ever thought we could get by with just
[2:17:49] keeping heaping praise
[2:17:51] on this message and not doing what it
[2:17:54] said
[2:17:55] it would do you believe it jesus said
[2:17:57] you are my disciples
[2:17:59] when you keep my commandments
[2:18:04] when you go into all the world when you
[2:18:07] forgive your brother
[2:18:09] or your sister as he forgave you
[2:18:12] when you don't hold any odd in your
[2:18:14] heart
[2:18:15] when you're living for him every morning
[2:18:17] you're a love slave to him
[2:18:21] without these signs and wonders
[2:18:23] manifested in our midst
[2:18:25] we will never produce rapturing faith
[2:18:29] it is part of the plan of god
[2:18:32] that's why at the end he said that he
[2:18:35] would restore
[2:18:36] the faith of our fathers be and the
[2:18:39] works and signs that he did
[2:18:41] you will do also because it was going to
[2:18:44] take
[2:18:45] those things to become real to you
[2:18:48] in order for the rapture to become to
[2:18:50] you and to most
[2:18:52] of you the rapture is a fantasy
[2:18:58] you no more believe it can happen in the
[2:19:00] morning than nothing
[2:19:02] our lives testify to it
[2:19:07] but you know what we've done we've
[2:19:10] formed a denomination
[2:19:14] do you believe in malachi 4 5 oh yes sir
[2:19:23] do you believe the seals are open
[2:19:28] oh i forgot this is on the internet
[2:19:31] blot it out
[2:19:35] what's wrong with this
[2:19:38] we've got to make this flesh i've got to
[2:19:41] have this
[2:19:43] i've got to press to this i've got to
[2:19:45] get in that condition
[2:19:47] the condition of the rapture is the
[2:19:50] power of the resurrection
[2:19:52] manifested in flesh if this same spirit
[2:19:56] was in christ jesus it will quicken your
[2:19:59] mortal body
[2:20:00] the prophet of god said if the spirit of
[2:20:03] a race car driver
[2:20:05] mario andretti or some race car was in
[2:20:07] you you would be a
[2:20:09] race driver if the spirit of
[2:20:12] michelangelo was in you
[2:20:13] you would be a painter if the spirit of
[2:20:16] christ was in you
[2:20:18] you would do the works that he did
[2:20:22] whatever made us think that we were
[2:20:25] going to
[2:20:25] bypass the works bypass the
[2:20:28] manifestation
[2:20:30] bypass the fulfillment of the
[2:20:32] restoration of the faith of our fathers
[2:20:34] and make the rapture what
[2:20:37] ever got that in our mind brother
[2:20:42] lord clear my brain let me start afresh
[2:20:47] let me start anew let me get back to
[2:20:50] hunger and
[2:20:51] thirst and after righteousness let me
[2:20:53] get back filled again god with your
[2:20:55] spirit
[2:20:56] let me seek a refilling of the holy
[2:20:58] spirit
[2:20:59] let me seek the baptism of the holy
[2:21:01] spirit let me apply the token to my life
[2:21:04] make sure i'm born again
[2:21:13] he said that this he said that the
[2:21:16] believer
[2:21:17] is the faith of god moving in you
[2:21:21] you must have a moving
[2:21:25] faith
[2:21:29] bottom line we've got to get off the
[2:21:33] church pews
[2:21:35] and testify we've got to get off the
[2:21:38] church view
[2:21:39] and testify to the sick we've got to get
[2:21:42] off the church views and lay our hands
[2:21:44] we've got to lay for ourselves a pattern
[2:21:48] of good works we've got to make full
[2:21:50] proof
[2:21:52] of our calling
[2:21:57] it's time that the church pulls itself
[2:22:01] into the power of faith
[2:22:05] it's promised to us it's at hand
[2:22:10] it's here we saw the door
[2:22:14] we've slept with them now
[2:22:18] manifesting time i don't want to be a
[2:22:22] church
[2:22:24] with a catechism
[2:22:27] i don't want sunday to be bible study

[2:23:00] lord
