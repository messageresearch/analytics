[28:06] lifted towards you
[28:09] lord i'm so grateful the joy that i feel
[28:13] in my heart
[28:15] lord knowing that
[28:16] [Music]
[28:18] you committed
[28:22] and swore by yourself for there was no
[28:24] greater
[28:26] that you'd never lose me
[28:29] you'd never leave me
[28:31] you'd never forsake me
[28:33] and that you would finish the work in
[28:35] luke
[28:39] the 19th chapter
[28:41] of the gospel of luke and
[28:47] we'll we'll read the
[28:51] scriptures found here let's see which
[28:54] one of these glasses works among the
[28:56] publicans
[28:57] and he was rich
[28:59] and he sought to see jesus
[29:01] who
[29:03] who he was and could not for the press
[29:06] because he was little of stature
[29:09] so he ran before and climbed up into a
[29:12] sycamore tree to see him for he was to
[29:16] pass that way
[29:17] and when jesus came to the place
[29:20] he looked up and saw him
[29:23] and said unto him zacakias make haste
[29:27] and come down
[29:28] for today
[29:30] i must abide at thy
[29:33] house
[29:34] notice something he knew his name
[29:37] didn't he he knew where he was and he
[29:39] knew what he had planned for him
[29:42] amen
[29:43] and he made haste and came down and
[29:46] received him joyfully
[29:48] when he saw it
[29:49] they were all murmuring saying that he
[29:52] was gone to be guest with a man
[29:55] that that is a sinner
[29:58] and zacchaeus stood and said unto the
[30:01] lord behold lord
[30:03] the half of my goods i give to the poor
[30:07] and if i have taken anything
[30:10] from any man
[30:12] by false accusation i will restore unto
[30:15] him fourfold
[30:18] that was a confession
[30:20] right
[30:21] so that's what happens when you come
[30:23] into the presence of the lord you know
[30:25] to make it everything comes out doesn't
[30:28] it
[30:28] and jesus said to him this day is
[30:31] salvation
[30:32] good to see you we've got a lot of miles
[30:34] in this journey don't we
[30:36] but god's been good
[30:38] so tonight we're going to listen to 20
[30:40] minutes
[30:42] out of the sermon
[30:43] brother branham preached
[30:45] in 1954
[30:47] called show us the father
[30:50] show us the father
[30:52] and
[30:54] you know when you want to see the father
[30:57] you want to see him in present tense
[31:00] zacchaeus didn't just want to hear the
[31:03] stories about what that he had done
[31:05] worked everything but he wanted to see
[31:08] for himself he wanted to look upon his
[31:11] face and and to look for himself and see
[31:14] the things of god
[31:17] and so in this message show us the
[31:19] father
[31:20] brother brahman says that there's four
[31:23] places that
[31:24] you can see god
[31:27] at four places you can see god i like to
[31:30] see god don't you amen i like to i like
[31:33] to see him when when uh you know
[31:36] somebody comes in and ministers the word
[31:38] of god and it's
[31:40] right down the line
[31:41] you know you give a song and it's right
[31:44] in the line uh you some you know you
[31:47] just see you know it's the hand of god
[31:49] you know god's moving you know
[31:52] and so he said there's four places you
[31:54] can see god one is in his universe
[31:59] and we know in romans uh uh 1 20 it says
[32:03] the invisible things of him are clearly
[32:06] seen in the visible things he creates
[32:09] and brother branham goes on and explains
[32:11] how that you can see
[32:13] is that right so the
[32:16] jesus said if you can't believe me for
[32:18] my word's sake
[32:20] believe me for the works
[32:22] i came not in my own name but i came in
[32:25] my father's name and he says the works
[32:28] he says
[32:30] it so judge me by my works
[32:33] you know what i mean and so and then he
[32:36] said which of you can
[32:37] convict me of sin or accuse me of sin
[32:40] so we could actually see by the things
[32:43] that jesus did
[32:45] it showed that that's where god was and
[32:48] the last place that we see god is in his
[32:52] people
[32:53] amen so we want to listen to this and
[32:56] the reason we're listening to this
[32:58] because i sat in church and listened to
[33:01] it the other day and i was so excited i
[33:02] just said i got to play this for
[33:05] the people
[33:06] but he's talking about the spirit and
[33:08] he's talking so he's talking about this
[33:11] little section we'll pick it up just 20
[33:13] minutes then i'll close maybe with
[33:15] another
[33:17] 20 minutes and we'll have a nice time in
[33:20] the lord right
[33:21] and then we'll go we'll go out and be
[33:24] about the father's business
[33:26] isn't that what we want to be we want to
[33:28] be about the father's business
[33:30] we want to
[33:32] we want to do the works of the father so
[33:35] we'll let's we'll go back we'll identify
[33:38] him in the scriptures we'll talk about
[33:39] at the moment in terms but anyway okay
[33:42] let's just sit back how many believes
[33:44] it's the voice of god
[33:46] i do
[33:48] amen i i want you to know what firmly
[33:51] what i believe i think a minister if
[33:53] he's going to preach to the people if
[33:55] he's going to receive blessings of him
[33:57] that he should be very clear
[34:00] on what he stands for okay i don't
[34:02] believe the message is over
[34:06] i don't believe that we've had brother
[34:07] branham now for 63 years we know what he
[34:11] said and we're waiting for the spirit to
[34:14] fall
[34:15] and
[34:16] to anoint us
[34:18] i i want you to know what i firmly
[34:21] believe
[34:23] because there's a lot of movement
[34:24] towards those things
[34:26] i firmly believe with all my heart
[34:29] there are still revelations contained
[34:33] in the things that brother branham
[34:35] teaches
[34:36] that has spiritually been stored up
[34:40] and they're still there to lead us and
[34:43] guide us
[34:44] i do not believe that the holy spirit is
[34:47] going to give a new leadership to the
[34:50] church
[34:51] outside of the voice of his messenger
[34:54] and i want you to be very clear
[34:57] and and i believe that that's why i am
[35:00] the way that i am some people might
[35:03] refer to me as an ice cube preacher but
[35:06] that's okay i want my fire to be under
[35:08] the right thing
[35:10] amen that's when i want my fire to be
[35:13] underneath the revelation
[35:15] that
[35:16] god is still leading us and he sent a
[35:19] guide and what we have need of is still
[35:22] in those tests like paul said i'm not
[35:23] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[35:26] because it's the power of god and the
[35:28] salvation and to me the message of
[35:31] william branham is the gospel for the
[35:34] hour and age that we live in so god
[35:36] bless you as we list for these minutes i
[35:38] think you'll really enjoy it you can go
[35:40] back and listen the tape's only 59
[35:42] minutes long so you can finish it up
[35:45] real easy god bless you
[36:29] one time here's some time ago at infidel
[36:32] he crossed
[37:11] their trucks and he looked over at me
[37:13] and he said man he said i rented this
[37:15] truck and they charged me 20 dollars of
[37:18] gas and i only drove three miles i did
[37:21] the math real quick and that wasn't too
[37:23] bad
[37:26] but
[37:26] uh so i told him i said well i said
[37:28] anytime you need a truck or something
[37:30] like that you just call me i got an
[37:32] extra truck well i'll come get it we
[37:34] talked a little bit and i said i
[37:35] pastored church here in
[37:37] in
[37:38] bedford texas he says well i pastor a
[37:40] church in haltom city
[37:42] i said good he said i'd love to sit down
[37:44] with you and talk to you about all the
[37:46] things that god's doing
[37:48] the promise of our age
[37:50] water baptism the evidence of the holy
[37:53] spirit may not have to sit down
[37:55] and and talk to you about all these
[37:57] things because
[37:59] i believe those are the things that god
[38:01] likes us to talk about
[38:03] so it was really exciting so i don't
[38:06] know are we going to be able to go
[38:07] forward
[38:13] okay
[38:14] they're going to rewire
[38:16] all right and we know that in when
[38:19] people talk about adopted people want to
[38:21] be adopted and and the scripture tells
[38:24] us that
[38:25] that we were lost and but now god
[38:29] through adoption brought us in and now
[38:32] we're joint heirs with him so we were
[38:35] made equal we were sinners and as
[38:37] sinners we could never partake of the
[38:40] things that god had for us to partake of
[38:44] that that avenue was cut off of us
[38:47] because the works and the business that
[38:49] we were about didn't represent what the
[38:52] father was about
[38:54] okay but so to be adopted is you're
[38:57] tutored by the holy spirit we understand
[39:00] that you're taught you you go through
[39:03] things and
[39:04] and you know i have some of the brothers
[39:06] working for me and
[39:07] uh you know i'm always yelling at him
[39:10] you know
[39:11] you know do this do that why did you do
[39:13] that for you know but i'm a tutor you
[39:16] know what i mean
[39:17] i'm trying to get them to think the way
[39:19] that you think when you're working on a
[39:22] job and they've never been on a job
[39:24] before
[39:25] they don't have the terminologies that i
[39:27] have for things but they're learning
[39:29] quick and the minute they get it they
[39:32] pour in there
[39:33] but there there's a time comes
[39:36] when
[39:37] we want to listen to this portion is is
[39:39] we want you to hear the spirit of the
[39:41] prophet of god
[39:43] and how and what he talks about what the
[39:46] holy spirit is and how the holy spirit
[39:49] is in fact you know the scripture says
[39:51] the holy spirit didn't even come to
[39:52] speak of itself
[39:56] to do what
[39:57] bring you into remembrance of all the
[40:00] things that i've taught you so we
[40:03] believe in the baptism of the holy
[40:04] spirit it's not a third person
[40:07] it's not something different there's
[40:08] only one god
[40:10] and when you're filled with that one god
[40:12] you're filled with that one god and
[40:14] there's only one way that a man can come
[40:18] to be filled with that one god is that
[40:21] nobody cometh unto the father but by me
[40:24] i will not leave you comfortless but i
[40:27] personal pronoun
[40:29] will come again and i'll be with you
[40:31] even in you till the end so let's list
[40:34] 20 minutes and and then
[40:37] i'll subtract what i just said off of
[40:39] what i was going to say after as after
[40:41] uh god bless you
[40:45] after god is in his universe
[40:48] god is moving in his universe watch wish
[40:51] we had time to go into that real good
[40:52] and deep one time here's some time ago
[40:55] at infidel he crossed the country and he
[40:57] was making converts going to people and
[41:00] tell him that there was no such a thing
[41:01] as god he went to england no preacher
[41:04] was seemed to want to attacked him he
[41:05] was a powerful man and when he come hell
[41:08] i've been wrong did you come there
[41:10] according the way i thought it or is the
[41:12] bible right and there's that big bully
[41:15] infidel that preachers is afraid to
[41:16] attack god picked out nature got her and
[41:19] converted that man and he's a preacher
[41:20] in the field today preaching the gospel
[41:22] of the lord jesus christ why if they
[41:24] hold their peace the rocks will
[41:26] immediately crowd god speaks out of his
[41:27] nature you believe that
[41:30] god is in his nature watch how
[41:32] everything takes place millions of
[41:33] things we could speak of if time would
[41:35] just permit it how god is in his nature
[41:37] you believe god's the nature in this
[41:39] universe now god in his word god's
[41:42] promise to bless his word he'll watch
[41:44] over his word to perform take care of it
[41:47] you believe that
[41:48] the word of god jesus said was a seed
[41:51] and it's the seed of god
[41:53] every word is the seed the sword went
[41:55] forth sowing seeds jesus said and when a
[41:58] deceit was the word of god not every
[42:00] word of god is the seed of god and it
[42:03] will produce just exactly what the bible
[42:06] says it is
[42:07] if you need salvation take the seed of
[42:09] god
[42:10] come on to me all your labor and heavy
[42:11] laden if you need healing i'm the lord
[42:13] that healthy anything you have need of
[42:15] is a promise this bible
[42:17] god will take care of every promise
[42:20] listen to this i say this reverently
[42:23] quietly so he can remember
[42:25] what god will do
[42:27] the right mental attitude towards any
[42:29] divine promise of god will bring it to
[42:31] pass
[42:32] if you'll take the right mental attitude
[42:34] towards any divine it's right there in a
[42:36] tree right that if it doesn't where does
[42:37] it come from
[42:39] the tree only thing it does is just suck
[42:41] the water from the earth
[42:43] and it has to draw more than its potion
[42:45] because it has to draw so much into it
[42:47] till it pushes out it'll push out
[42:48] branches then it'll draw it'll push out
[42:51] limbs
[42:52] and then it'll draw push out blossoms
[42:54] and push out oranges it's just
[42:56] constantly drawing and pushing out
[42:59] drawing and pushing out that's the way
[43:01] the man is is born to the spirit of god
[43:03] when he takes god's promise into his
[43:04] heart
[43:05] and look the only thing that god does is
[43:08] plant you in jesus christ by the holy
[43:10] ghost and everything you have need of in
[43:12] this earth journey is in you when you
[43:14] receive the holy oak amen
[43:17] the only thing you have to do is draw
[43:20] and push out i'll tell you what some
[43:21] other christian tonight you're not
[43:23] drawing dividends on your baptism of the
[43:25] holy ghost draw in and drink and drink
[43:28] and drink and drink till you push out
[43:29] salvation push out divine healing push
[43:32] out the baptist holy ghost just drink
[43:34] drink drink and you're planted by the
[43:36] inexhaustible fountain of life which is
[43:38] jesus christ he is thirsty ladies and
[43:40] gents

[43:43] come whosoever will let him come and
[43:45] drink from the fountains of the water of
[43:46] life freely

[43:51] there god in his word god's got to keep
[43:54] his word we just had time and pushing

[47:15] hands and every star come into existence
[47:17] hallelujah
[47:19] they send your owner in order to take
[47:22] the stinger out of death to put it in
[47:24] your own body to put sickness in your
[47:26] own body to bear it for us give it to us
[47:28] in the word confirmed it by the holy
[47:30] ghost you in your word in your son now
[47:33] in your people how could we doubt any
[47:35] lord show us the father and surprises us
[47:38] lord we believe tonight that you're the
[47:40] same god that walked on galilee we
[47:42] believe that you're the same one back
[47:44] down here before there was a star in the
[47:45] heavens it said let there be light and
[47:47] the sun coming to existence
[47:50] god be merciful for us and i pray
[47:52] tonight that your sweet for revival

[48:02] grant tonight that the lame walk the
[48:03] blind see the death here in the dumb
[48:05] jesus of the very heart of god
[48:08] jesus you're manifesting his father's
[48:10] love
[48:11] to the people then i think god was in
[48:13] his son and now he said a little while
[48:15] the world shifts me no more yet you'll
[48:17] see me
[48:18] for i'll be with you even in you then
[48:20] god is in his people tonight showing the
[48:22] same signs and wonders that he did when
[48:24] he was in galilee same sign waters he
[48:26] did when he come to the wilderness and
[48:27] the pillar of fire he's the same jehovah
[48:30] god today that was back underneath when
[48:32] he come down in nature
[48:35] amen
[48:38] oh my
[48:40] well i look out and think how petty and
[48:41] how little and we people who confess
[48:44] that we have kissed the rims of the cup
[48:46] for the blessings of his power
[48:48] and can sit still and look upon this
[48:51] sinful world and hold our peace i wonder
[48:53] sometimes if we don't need another dip
[48:55] from god amen

[49:01] you morning stars and shout the praises
[49:03] of god that's right don't let the devil

[49:10] one legal power

[49:14] stripped him of everything he had
[49:16] the only thing tonight he's got is the

[57:28] the giddy and we sat in my office
[57:30] and we were just talking about the
[57:32] gideons he said we used to give out 80
[57:34] million bibles a year
[57:38] he said but now with this new woke thing

[57:44] offend anything and again the great
[57:46] hotels you know where they used to put
[57:49] them in and and they said we we put
[57:51] bibles in all the high traffic areas
[57:53] airports everywhere now they can't

[58:00] they try to give out a year
[58:04] okay we were just sitting back there
[58:06] little meaning about and he said
[58:08] something to me he says you know it's
[58:09] just a struggle

[58:13] battle you've got to fight every day
[58:16] like he said you've got to possess every
[58:18] gate that you got it's hard to live it's
[58:21] hard to get up in the morning it's hard
[58:23] to go to work it's hard to do those
[58:26] things
[58:27] it's a battle it's a battle to be a
[58:29] christian life is a constant warfare
[58:32] it's never going to end you cannot run
[58:35] from it because it's after you satan's
[58:38] like a roaring lion going about seeking
[58:40] more devour he will follow you to your
[58:43] doorstep

[58:48] you can't run from him
[58:50] he's a disguiser he's a deceiver he'll
[58:53] just change your struggle
[58:55] he'll just change the battle
[58:58] sure
[58:59] you know that's one thing you can't you
[59:01] you we're in a fight it's a warfare
[59:04] it's a battle but you know you go
[59:06] through the battle and you fight the
[59:08] battle and and and i like what brother
[59:10] brown says here pretty soon you find out
[59:12] you got to take god's word
[59:14] that's his weapon
[59:16] that's the only thing you can fight this
[59:17] battle for now you know and i i was all
[59:20] upset about certain things the way they
[59:22] were going and then the scripture comes
[59:24] back and says be anxious for nothing
[59:26] amen
[59:29] you know i worried about getting this
[59:31] done and worried about getting you and
[59:33] then you know
[59:34] how am i going to do this and god just
[59:36] sends somebody by
[59:38] he told me so i can show you everything
[59:41] on this piece of property i can take you
[59:43] and show you right here in your yard
[59:46] right now where the toilets will be
[59:50] i said you can do that yeah he said i
[59:52] can overlay everything i can do it he's
[59:54] got all these little machines you know
[59:56] and if he puts this machine up and he's
[59:59] got something on him and no matter where
[1:00:01] he walks he can tell me right where he
[1:00:03] is just how hard it is he says i'll do
[1:00:06] all this for you i'll do the cut and
[1:00:08] i'll get all the dirt put everywhere and
[1:00:10] i thought oh god
[1:00:13] i wasted all that time
[1:00:17] worrying
[1:00:19] praise god i didn't have a full head of
[1:00:20] hair
[1:00:22] but i'm telling you
[1:00:24] he's got it all planned out you you
[1:00:26] don't you don't worry you just don't
[1:00:28] have to worry about it but you know a
[1:00:31] lot of people
[1:00:32] they're in the battle
[1:00:34] i already preached this how many knows i
[1:00:36] already preached this okay so i'm just
[1:00:38] preaching this because it ties in with
[1:00:40] where i'm going
[1:00:41] is that
[1:00:43] the the battle you're in the battle
[1:00:45] you're in the battle but once you once
[1:00:47] you're starting to fight the battle then
[1:00:49] the burden comes
[1:00:52] your burden
[1:00:54] did you hear what brother brown said he
[1:00:55] says how can you claim all these
[1:00:57] blessings of god and sit around and not
[1:00:59] tell somebody not do something
[1:01:02] not witness it
[1:01:04] and see and and that's
[1:01:07] where that the church is right now
[1:01:12] he's wanting to get to go about
[1:01:16] he the church has been adopted
[1:01:20] if you're still looking for your
[1:01:21] adoption then you you have you don't
[1:01:23] have the fellowship
[1:01:25] with the message of the hour the way you
[1:01:28] should
[1:01:29] you've got a clear absolute voice that
[1:01:33] was vindicated by signs and wonders in a
[1:01:36] pillar of fire to instruct you in
[1:01:40] everything that you have need of
[1:01:43] the trouble is is we don't play tapes to
[1:01:45] our churches we don't play tapes at home
[1:01:48] we don't listen to the voice of god in
[1:01:50] our day
[1:01:52] and i just want to know how can people
[1:01:55] claim that the mysteries of god were
[1:01:58] revealed and the pillar of fire came the
[1:02:00] mighty angel set his foot on the land
[1:02:03] and sea and the ministry of william
[1:02:05] branham the voice of god and not play it
[1:02:08] to their congregations i hope that's one
[1:02:11] thing you accomplish
[1:02:15] i can't understand it
[1:02:18] am i a fanatic
[1:02:21] no because i believe there's a burden
[1:02:23] coming to the church there's a burden
[1:02:25] that's going to fall on the elect a
[1:02:27] burden something that's going to burn in
[1:02:29] their hearts and what is that burden
[1:02:32] it's a burden to be about the father's
[1:02:35] business
[1:02:37] what does it mean when you're adopted
[1:02:40] it means that god turns his business
[1:02:43] over to you
[1:02:48] he's not you're not forever learning
[1:02:51] and never coming to the realization of
[1:02:53] truth
[1:02:55] you've heard his voice you've heard his
[1:02:58] instruction you know his doctrines you
[1:03:01] know the seals have been opened you know
[1:03:03] the mysteries you've seen them go down
[1:03:06] through the ages and four beasts you see
[1:03:08] god's four beasts battling them you know
[1:03:11] the horse riders you know the spirits
[1:03:13] you know what the evidence of things is
[1:03:16] you know what the godhead is you know
[1:03:18] how to baptize right you know what it is
[1:03:20] to be filled with the holy ghost is to
[1:03:22] say amen to every word of god and to
[1:03:24] believe every promise of god
[1:03:28] amen you know what it is
[1:03:33] and everything other than that's a
[1:03:35] mental battle
[1:03:37] it's where the battle is it's in the
[1:03:38] mind it's just a mental battle mental
[1:03:40] battle
[1:03:41] satan lined against us doing things news
[1:03:44] flashes everything that just wars on
[1:03:46] your brain till your brain's so weak
[1:03:53] you get exhausted
[1:03:57] that's what he's looking for
[1:03:59] he's looking for men and women say i got
[1:04:01] an absolute
[1:04:02] i've got a source i've got a place i'd
[1:04:05] go to i got a place that i feed i've got
[1:04:08] a storehouse full of living word that's
[1:04:11] there for me that
[1:04:13] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:04:15] their strength sin it out wait it out
[1:04:18] you know the bride doesn't do nothing
[1:04:20] until she has thus saith the lord it'll
[1:04:22] never go lie to a person right to their
[1:04:25] face it shows you it's not of god
[1:04:28] first sign of a christian is they're
[1:04:31] honest
[1:04:34] if you ain't got it i don't got it
[1:04:37] get it
[1:04:40] what do you heard him say what did he
[1:04:42] say get it take it
[1:04:44] it's yours take it
[1:04:48] but the burden
[1:04:53] i'm done fighting the battle
[1:04:55] isn't that what we've been talking about
[1:04:58] time for him to do the fight
[1:05:00] how do you overcome let him overcome
[1:05:03] you've got to do it
[1:05:05] you've got to do it i don't care where
[1:05:07] you are
[1:05:08] places you live don't matter any place
[1:05:11] you know it's what's in your heart
[1:05:14] it's what what has this message done in
[1:05:17] your mind to come through your mind and
[1:05:20] fill your heart up
[1:05:23] if you thought the spirit the message
[1:05:25] you understood what brother ben did
[1:05:27] brother branham looked out at a lost
[1:05:29] dying world
[1:05:32] they didn't even know what god was they
[1:05:33] were lost in denominationalism
[1:05:36] they didn't even understand the power of
[1:05:38] satan that was ruling over them
[1:05:41] and here he come a one-man invasion
[1:05:46] telling them their trinity doctrine was
[1:05:47] keeping them
[1:05:49] them that that wasn't the evidence tell
[1:05:51] them about a god that was the same
[1:05:53] yesterday today and forever trying to
[1:05:55] bring life
[1:05:57] why because he was packing a burden
[1:06:01] he said i don't preach these things
[1:06:04] because i hate you i preach these things
[1:06:06] because i love you
[1:06:10] he made the stand he did you think it
[1:06:12] was easy for him
[1:06:14] all the ministers there that were
[1:06:16] supporting them all the assemblies in
[1:06:18] upc and all those people there and all
[1:06:21] those women sitting there with their
[1:06:22] bobbed hair and their hairdos and their
[1:06:25] earrings on to stand up and tell them
[1:06:28] is wrong
[1:06:31] what do you think drove that in him
[1:06:34] it was a burden
[1:06:36] it was a burden for their souls because
[1:06:39] he knew that that was a jezebel spirit
[1:06:42] he knew that you couldn't get there
[1:06:44] wearing those kind of shoes he knew that
[1:06:47] it was a sin to lust upon him and the
[1:06:49] way they were dressed he didn't do that
[1:06:52] just because it was the truth's sake
[1:06:55] he preached it from burden
[1:06:58] he was burdened
[1:07:01] he chose the narrower way
[1:07:04] and the harder way
[1:07:06] because he had a burden on his heart you
[1:07:08] know why he had a burden on his heart
[1:07:10] because he was about the father's
[1:07:12] business
[1:07:15] and that's what i'm saying if this
[1:07:17] church
[1:07:19] is going to
[1:07:20] receive
[1:07:23] the work of the father
[1:07:26] the works that i do
[1:07:28] shall you do also
[1:07:32] so it would have to be the same thing
[1:07:34] that motivated him
[1:07:37] why did he come he said i've come the
[1:07:39] son of man's come
[1:07:40] to save
[1:07:42] and to seek them
[1:07:45] that are lost
[1:07:48] and i think that that there's a thing
[1:07:51] that's going to move on the heart
[1:07:53] of the believer
[1:07:55] that
[1:07:56] that
[1:07:57] is going to give them such a burden
[1:08:01] for people that don't have what you've
[1:08:04] got
[1:08:06] the scripture says it's been freely
[1:08:08] given to you freely give
[1:08:12] and there's when you're so sure of what
[1:08:14] you received you're so sure of what he's
[1:08:18] done for you you know what he's taking
[1:08:20] you from you know what he saved you from
[1:08:23] how many i mean i don't even want but i
[1:08:26] and i pray that it i never have to all
[1:08:29] the things that he's covered with his
[1:08:31] blood to be made known
[1:08:36] the love and the forgiveness he's had
[1:08:38] for us and
[1:08:40] what he's got prepared for us
[1:08:44] it ought to it ought to bubble up do you
[1:08:46] understand satan's got us boxed in he's
[1:08:50] got us in this in insomnia he's he's got
[1:08:54] us just in the struggle and in the
[1:08:56] battle
[1:08:57] because he knows
[1:09:01] if you ever take on the burden
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:08] when you become in one mind and one
[1:09:10] according you have the burden
[1:09:16] the same burden he had
[1:09:20] to go seek the lost
[1:09:23] i have need to go by here
[1:09:26] he goes to the woman at the well he said
[1:09:28] if you knew who i was you'd ask me for a
[1:09:30] drink i have living waters you know not
[1:09:33] of yes
[1:09:36] it is until the the
[1:09:38] burden comes
[1:09:40] to do what the father's business was
[1:09:43] what was this business we just heard it
[1:09:45] quoted i got i got all these scriptures
[1:09:48] wrote down here and i'm not going to
[1:09:50] take the time to read them all i want to
[1:09:51] just lay it in the word but i want to
[1:09:53] give this off my heart to you
[1:09:56] because it's where i'm going
[1:10:00] and i hope you go with me
[1:10:03] and i hope that that's that this church
[1:10:07] understands
[1:10:09] i believe if we stay in this message
[1:10:11] he's going to reveal continue to reveal
[1:10:14] his word to us and we're going to grow
[1:10:17] in divine revelation
[1:10:20] but i don't want it to be revelation
[1:10:23] alone show me your faith without your
[1:10:25] works and i will show you my by my works
[1:10:29] works is faith expressed
[1:10:34] and what was the work of the father
[1:10:40] you know we talk about
[1:10:42] the baptism of the holy spirit we talk
[1:10:45] about pentecost we talk about revivals
[1:10:48] but you look at the first pentecost
[1:10:52] he sent him into the upper room to be
[1:10:54] endued with power from on high
[1:10:56] why
[1:10:59] so they could carry out the commission
[1:11:03] go into all the world preach the gospel
[1:11:07] pray for the sick they shall recover he
[1:11:10] gave the commission he says now go wait
[1:11:13] for the the power from on high that
[1:11:16] you're endued with this power so you can
[1:11:19] go carry out the commission
[1:11:21] so first pentecost came with a
[1:11:23] commission
[1:11:27] to go into all the world
[1:11:29] to preach the gospel
[1:11:31] to share the gospel to tell others
[1:11:35] that's why they were endued with power
[1:11:37] because they were going to receive a
[1:11:39] burden
[1:11:40] with it
[1:11:41] oh israel they are not drunk as you
[1:11:43] suppose but this is what was preached
[1:11:45] joel and then he starts talking about
[1:11:47] how that they crucified the only lord of
[1:11:50] glory
[1:11:53] that's what they're doing
[1:11:54] we're not living to survive
[1:11:57] we're not survivors we're conquerors
[1:12:03] we're not running from the devil
[1:12:06] we're pulling our swords
[1:12:09] calling him what he is he's a bluff
[1:12:13] so i played that key tonight i wanted
[1:12:15] you to see the enthusiasm that our
[1:12:18] messenger had for this gospel and the
[1:12:20] burden that was on his heart
[1:12:23] but then there came the restoration of
[1:12:25] the gifts but everybody refers to
[1:12:27] pentecost the 1906 pentecost well
[1:12:30] they're not we're not restored back to
[1:12:32] the 1906 pentecost
[1:12:37] we're restored back to the burden
[1:12:39] of our fathers
[1:12:41] the faith
[1:12:42] that they had that they could take this
[1:12:45] gospel
[1:12:47] and preach it without fear of favor
[1:12:50] testify to it and that the living god
[1:12:53] would stand behind them and perform
[1:12:55] signs and wonders following
[1:12:58] this new pentecost everybody's running
[1:13:00] after nowadays
[1:13:03] it came with speaking in tongues
[1:13:06] you know what speaking in tongues is
[1:13:08] it's a sign that the age has ended
[1:13:13] it's what it was
[1:13:15] and you've got all kinds of
[1:13:16] impersonations
[1:13:19] all kinds of things
[1:13:20] and i thought about this so much i
[1:13:23] thought
[1:13:24] i don't
[1:13:27] pentecost wasn't meant for us
[1:13:32] what good does it do us to shout
[1:13:35] and to run around
[1:13:37] and
[1:13:38] and and say that we're blessed
[1:13:42] this isn't okay this great outpouring of
[1:13:45] the spirit
[1:13:46] it wasn't and and these signs and
[1:13:48] wonders that shall follow where did the
[1:13:51] signs and wonders came from it came from
[1:13:53] the commission it came from the burden
[1:13:56] some are kind of burdened they're out
[1:13:58] testifying they're telling people about
[1:14:01] this word they're winning you know
[1:14:03] i don't want to build this church
[1:14:06] on a prosthetics
[1:14:10] i want to build it on people that are
[1:14:12] coming to the truth
[1:14:15] so you've got a gospel and so what does
[1:14:18] it do is that we have a revival inside
[1:14:20] these walls
[1:14:24] we all shout and we all praise god and
[1:14:26] kim were all on fire and and we got get
[1:14:29] all
[1:14:30] worked up
[1:14:33] these signs and wonders weren't to be
[1:14:35] performed on us
[1:14:37] they were to be performed by us
[1:14:44] you understand it isn't me praying for
[1:14:46] you and you getting well and you praying
[1:14:48] for me they're not to be
[1:14:50] performed on us they're to be performed
[1:14:53] by
[1:14:54] us because we're about the father's
[1:14:57] business we got a burden for this lost
[1:15:00] world
[1:15:02] when it's freely given to us we want to
[1:15:04] share what god did for us
[1:15:07] and then when they believe
[1:15:11] god will manifest every promise you
[1:15:14] share with them that it's true
[1:15:20] but it's like us having a great big
[1:15:22] smorgasbord
[1:15:24] every sunday
[1:15:25] and only inviting us
[1:15:28] we all get fat
[1:15:30] we all get sassy
[1:15:32] we get high minded
[1:15:36] we approve one another and we pat one
[1:15:38] another on the bat
[1:15:41] i don't want to be about that
[1:15:44] i want to be about what he was about
[1:15:47] if i get adopted
[1:15:49] and i have a spirit in me
[1:15:53] then
[1:15:53] the works that he did i will do
[1:15:58] well who did he do those works on
[1:16:04] i haven't found the only record one
[1:16:06] another up let's take what we got and
[1:16:09] take it outside
[1:16:13] these signs don't follow the ministry
[1:16:17] we don't need preachers to get a prayer
[1:16:19] line you could have a prayer line at
[1:16:21] work
[1:16:22] all right
[1:16:23] preach it anyplace anywhere anytime this
[1:16:27] works that i do
[1:16:29] i'm sticking
[1:16:32] i'm sticking with the pillar of fire
[1:16:36] i'm you want the anointing for the age
[1:16:39] you want to be anointed for this age you
[1:16:42] want the rapture anointing for this age
[1:16:44] can you want the wisdom of god for this
[1:16:46] age you want the power for god for this
[1:16:49] age i'll tell you where it's at it's on
[1:16:51] the tapes now i might not be the most
[1:16:54] fiery bald preacher that there is but
[1:16:56] i'll guarantee you i've got signs and
[1:16:59] wonders and miracles and lists of things
[1:17:02] that i've seen god done not by me but by
[1:17:05] his word
[1:17:09] because the anointing is on the tapes
[1:17:12] so you might not think you're in a great
[1:17:14] big anointing service but i'll tell you
[1:17:17] one thing tonight you sat under the
[1:17:18] anointing
[1:17:20] of the hour
[1:17:25] you heard what it does he saw what it
[1:17:27] does and you could go back home and you
[1:17:29] could turn on all the
[1:17:31] and listen to the prayer cards and
[1:17:34] listen to the miracles that followed why
[1:17:36] because god stands in his word
[1:17:39] it's a burden
[1:17:41] brother branham's burden was to bring
[1:17:43] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:17:46] forever back to a dying church
[1:17:51] that's what his burden was
[1:17:52] is to make jesus christ alive and real
[1:17:56] in people's lives so he they could know
[1:17:58] he was the same they were dying
[1:18:03] and i'm afraid we're dying
[1:18:07] and we're taking a a
[1:18:10] a
[1:18:11] a big bunch of emotions
[1:18:14] as a substitute
[1:18:20] you want to be anointed
[1:18:22] you share this gospel someplace
[1:18:24] somewhere
[1:18:25] you dump all your pride
[1:18:28] you dump all your thing about looking
[1:18:30] foolish and stupid and idiotic saying
[1:18:34] that god sent a prophet
[1:18:37] if it's somebody of reputation go to
[1:18:39] them in private but when you're not
[1:18:41] ashamed to a stand you've got a burden
[1:18:44] for somebody that you want to share this
[1:18:46] word this message
[1:18:48] this hour
[1:18:50] in this age that we're living in is
[1:18:53] going into the highways and byways and
[1:18:56] sharing this life with whoever god opens
[1:19:00] the door for you
[1:19:03] i i i can't even wrap my mind
[1:19:06] around what our messenger went through
[1:19:09] because we're all believers earl wills
[1:19:11] told me that brother branham is
[1:19:13] preaching in the ramadi inn and he said
[1:19:16] that i think he shared that with matthew
[1:19:18] matthew may have been there he said they
[1:19:20] held their glasses up
[1:19:23] with their forks and were going
[1:19:29] well he's struggling
[1:19:31] to get this on tape
[1:19:33] struggling to get this word here
[1:19:36] to us
[1:19:38] laying that food up for us
[1:19:41] because it's the only thing that's going
[1:19:43] to guide us out of here
[1:19:46] he's not going to send a spiritual
[1:19:48] anointing and a baptism of the holy
[1:19:50] spirit to guide you out of here because
[1:19:52] it's contrary to his word
[1:19:57] he sent the ministry of the son of man
[1:20:00] to guide us out of here here's a
[1:20:02] statement of the body word feeding on
[1:20:05] the body word of the son of man
[1:20:08] the body
[1:20:11] word
[1:20:13] people feeding on the body words you
[1:20:15] know who they're feeding on they're
[1:20:17] feeding on you
[1:20:19] they're feeding on your works
[1:20:21] your signs and your wonders because
[1:20:25] you're about the father's business okay
[1:20:27] how can you say you're feeding on the
[1:20:29] body word of the son of man and we don't
[1:20:31] even listen to him
[1:20:35] i love it when a person is delivered but
[1:20:38] i want to see sinners get delivered
[1:20:39] don't you
[1:20:41] people that come from the hospital
[1:20:43] because somebody told them go down to
[1:20:45] the church and we'll pray for you and
[1:20:48] they get well
[1:20:49] it's no matter to me you get well you've
[1:20:52] got faith you've got revelation
[1:20:56] that's no great big accomplishment
[1:20:58] you jump up and praise god and run
[1:21:00] around the spirit that's no big deal
[1:21:02] you've got the spirit
[1:21:05] that don't satisfy me
[1:21:08] don't satisfy me
[1:21:12] i appreciate your brothers the other day
[1:21:14] some brother come in looking for
[1:21:15] somebody and it wasn't long they had
[1:21:17] them at the altar praying for him that's
[1:21:18] what i mean these scriptures wrote down
[1:21:20] here that you know uh i just i just saw
[1:21:23] this one i thought i'd just run to it
[1:21:25] real quick
[1:21:26] it's proverbs
[1:21:29] where's proverbs here it is
[1:21:31] i thought this was a good scripture very
[1:21:34] short
[1:21:35] very sweet and i'm done
[1:21:37] but problems i think it's 11 30.
[1:21:47] the fruit of the righteous
[1:21:49] is a tree of life
[1:21:55] and he that winneth souls
[1:21:58] is wise
[1:22:03] let's don't
[1:22:04] forget what we're here for church
[1:22:07] i just don't we're not here to produce
[1:22:10] we're here to share
[1:22:12] god stands by his word don't be ashamed
[1:22:14] of this gospel
[1:22:17] they're making it more difficult than
[1:22:19] every but you want victory in your life
[1:22:21] you want joy in your life
[1:22:25] you tell the world
[1:22:27] about him
[1:22:30] that's what it's all about
[1:22:33] and i really pray
[1:22:35] that we're not building this building
[1:22:37] for us even though we need it
[1:22:40] it's going to look awfully empty on a
[1:22:41] wednesday night unless god
[1:22:44] does some great things but i believe
[1:22:46] he's doing great things
[1:22:48] and it's not going to be the preachers
[1:22:50] that doing it
[1:22:52] it's going to be you
[1:22:54] the body word
[1:22:56] of the son of man
[1:22:58] you
[1:22:59] feeding people feeding on the body word
[1:23:03] of the son of man
[1:23:04] you the word made flesh in you the bride
[1:23:08] about their father's business
[1:23:10] go and look at what jesus business was
[1:23:13] mark and all these different scriptures
[1:23:15] that jesus told them to go out and
[1:23:17] preach and all that that was the work of
[1:23:20] the lord jesus
[1:23:22] so if we're going to be adopted
[1:23:26] then we're going to have to enter in
[1:23:29] to the father's work
[1:23:32] and the father's work was to redeem
[1:23:35] those that are lost
[1:23:37] that's the work of the father
[1:23:41] let's give out tapes
[1:23:43] let's give out books
[1:23:46] let's share your testimony
[1:23:49] don't be ashamed of this gospel
[1:23:53] you can run from it but it won't run
[1:23:55] from you
[1:23:58] god's got a whole list of works
[1:24:01] pre-planned for you how many believes
[1:24:03] that
[1:24:04] ephesians
[1:24:06] we are foreordained unto good works
[1:24:11] we are his workmanship
[1:24:14] foreordained the good works that we
[1:24:16] should walk in them
[1:24:17] i believe at church
[1:24:19] so
[1:24:20] anyway god bless you tonight
[1:24:22] and and that's just been burning on my
[1:24:25] heart and when i heard that the other
[1:24:26] day
[1:24:28] but it is for the elect
[1:24:32] and if we knew there was one more person
[1:24:35] out there
[1:24:38] one more
[1:24:40] might be in your office
[1:24:43] might be at your job site
[1:24:46] might be one of your customers
[1:24:49] but if we knew there was one more item
[1:24:51] to get
[1:24:53] on the list of a scavenger hunt and your
[1:24:56] team would win
[1:24:59] how much would you search for it
[1:25:02] everything is in the seed
[1:25:06] let's let's our seed
[1:25:08] be fruitful
[1:25:10] anyway
[1:25:11] i thought i would share that because
[1:25:13] that's where i'm going
[1:25:17] that's what i'm looking for
[1:25:20] i'm not looking for education
[1:25:23] i'm looking for us to perform the works
[1:25:28] not the works being performed on us
[1:25:31] so god bless you brother billy you just
[1:25:33] come and lead in some singing
[1:25:35] and i hope i i just want you to know
[1:25:38] it's a burden
[1:25:39] that's burning me alive
[1:25:41] and i believe if we enter into the
[1:25:43] burden you'll see victory like you've
[1:25:45] never seen it before
[1:25:46] lord richly bless you
[1:25:52] amen
