[28:07] blood of Jesus Christ that cleansed us
[28:09] from all unbelief
[28:10] and lower by

[41:52] take away the pain
[41:55] that you would receive the glory and the
[41:57] honor in all things we pray we commit
[41:59] them to you in Jesus Christ name we ask
[42:01] it
[42:02] amen we're reading out of uh II Peter
[42:05] verse chapter 1 verse four through eight
[42:09] would read like this whereby are given
[42:10] unto us exceedingly great and precious
[42:13] promises that by these ye might be
[42:15] partakers of the divine nature I only
[42:19] know one divine nature
[42:21] all right there's only one divine nature
[42:23] and you have been given a word and you
[42:25] have been given a promise that you might
[42:27] be a partaker of that divine nature
[42:30] having escaped the corruption that is in
[42:32] the world through lust and besides this
[42:34] giving diligence notice giving diligence
[42:38] is something that we got to pay
[42:39] attention to we got to work for we got
[42:41] to strive add to your faith virtue and
[42:43] to your virtue knowledge into knowledge
[42:45] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[42:47] into patience godliness and the
[42:49] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[42:50] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[42:53] things be in you
[42:54] for if these things be in you and abound
[42:59] well it's not good enough to just say
[43:00] they're there
[43:02] well it's there it's there but they need
[43:04] to abound
[43:08] we saw or we see in the scripture the
[43:10] divine nature Jesus Christ
[43:12] he he could have just said well I am
[43:14] what I am but he manifested what he was
[43:17] those attributes abounded
[43:21] for if you do these things in you and
[43:24] abound they make you that you shall
[43:26] never be barren nor unfruitful in the
[43:29] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may
[43:32] the Lord just bless the reading of his
[43:33] word you may be seated we'll also be
[43:35] reading a few other places uh if you'll
[43:37] turn with me to John chapter 12 verse
[43:40] 24.
[43:41] but I like that you notice uh and the
[43:44] scripture we just read it says if you do
[43:46] these things
[43:49] right if these things be in you and
[43:51] abound
[43:52] they make you that ye shall neither be
[43:55] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[43:57] of Jesus Christ well you you weren't
[44:00] called to be Barren and you weren't
[44:02] called to be unfruitful
[44:04] and so as we just move on over into John
[44:07] 12 24 just some familiar readings he
[44:10] says verily I say unto you except a corn
[44:13] of wheat fall into the ground and die it
[44:16] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[44:18] forth much fruit you turn on over into
[44:22] John chapter 15 verse 5.
[44:31] John chapter 15 verse 5.
[44:36] I am the Vine
[44:37] ye are the branches
[44:40] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[44:44] same bringeth forth much fruit
[44:47] for without me you can do nothing
[44:51] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[44:54] forth as a branch and is withered and
[44:56] Men gather them and cast them into the
[44:58] fire and they are burned if he abide in
[45:01] me in my words abide in you you shall
[45:04] ask what you will and it shall be done
[45:07] unto you so look at the formula if you
[45:10] abide in me
[45:11] and my words abide in you
[45:15] then
[45:17] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[45:19] be done unto you herein is my father
[45:21] glorified
[45:24] that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be
[45:27] my disciples well if we're going to Bear
[45:29] much fruit then we have to abide in him
[45:32] and his word has to abide in us and then
[45:36] we can ask what we will then we will
[45:38] bring much fruit then will the father be
[45:41] glorified and I just want to speak to
[45:43] you a little bit tonight on fruits of
[45:45] your election
[45:47] fruits of your election if we'll also
[45:49] turn over into Romans 4 16 and just uh
[45:52] speaking a little bit on Abraham here
[45:54] Paul would write in Romans chapter 4
[45:56] verse 16.
[45:58] I hope reading our Bibles is okay
[46:03] if we've gotten away from our Bible
[46:05] we've gotten away from God
[46:10] and I would I would uh recommend you do
[46:12] this
[46:13] when you listen to the message of the
[46:15] hour
[46:18] go back and search out what the prophet
[46:20] says to the scriptures you will find out
[46:23] it's Bible Bible Bible Bible Bible Bible
[46:26] and we allow things to be so common and
[46:29] you let it become a phrase and and and
[46:31] and forget that there is a living Oracle
[46:34] of God speaking the word making it flesh
[46:37] making it tangible if you start to trace
[46:39] those things back you'll find out in one
[46:41] paragraph there might be four or five
[46:43] and you get in and you see what Paul was
[46:45] saying and imagine you find that it's
[46:46] Christ and it starts tying together
[46:47] because that's what was given to the
[46:49] church to make this Bible live
[46:51] but you got to put it together
[46:54] if you if you don't if the if you don't
[46:56] allow the messenger of the age to ground
[46:58] you into the scripture then then you're
[47:00] one-footed
[47:02] because that's what the very message of
[47:04] the hour was founded was it was on the
[47:06] Bible
[47:07] and you can't have the New Testament
[47:08] without the Old Testament it's two Wings
[47:10] it gots to fly together and this message
[47:12] has to have the the Bible it it's all
[47:15] the word of God it all is fitly and
[47:18] joined together so just speaking on the
[47:21] fruits of your election we look into
[47:22] Romans chapter 4 and verse 16 it would
[47:25] read like this therefore it is a faith
[47:28] that it might be by grace to the end of
[47:30] the promise might be sure to all the sea
[47:34] not to that only witches of the law but
[47:37] to that also which as of the faith of
[47:39] Abraham who is the father of us all as
[47:43] it is written I have made thee a father
[47:45] of many nations before him whom he
[47:48] believed even God who quickeneth the
[47:50] dead and calleth those things which be
[47:53] not as though they were so we know that
[47:56] God by his grace and according to
[47:58] election has given us a promise and he
[48:00] has given us the holy spirit that we
[48:02] might be able to make this word become a
[48:05] reality in our daily lives
[48:09] God didn't give Abraham a promise
[48:13] and just say that you know hey you're
[48:15] going to be the father of many nations
[48:17] and it just became a buzzword when he
[48:20] where he went around and says hey I'm a
[48:22] father of many nations I'm a father of
[48:24] many nations and my seed is going to be
[48:26] uh numbered like the the Sands and the
[48:28] stars and it was just something uh that
[48:31] was out there that was some uh a phrase
[48:34] and he didn't have no understanding or
[48:37] no perception of really what was being
[48:40] promised unto him but Abraham knew
[48:42] exactly what had been promised to him he
[48:45] said you're going to be the father of
[48:46] the many nations you're you're going to
[48:48] have a son you're going to bring forth a
[48:51] son you're going to bring forth a child
[48:53] and Abraham was believing that promised
[48:56] word and he would not let off of that he
[48:58] staggered not at the promise of God
[49:00] because God had given him a word God had
[49:03] to give him a promise and there was
[49:05] something that Abraham was going to
[49:07] produce because he was elected he was
[49:10] chosen
[49:13] in Genesis chapter 12 out of everybody
[49:16] on the whole face of the world and all
[49:19] the planet God could have chose anybody
[49:21] but he chose Abraham and he came there
[49:23] to Abraham and he said Abraham I want
[49:26] you to separate yourself because I've
[49:28] elected you and I've chosen you and
[49:30] there's something that I want to
[49:31] accomplish in your life I'm going to
[49:33] give you a promise
[49:36] well you we see ourselves right there in
[49:40] the pattern
[49:41] you know I I was thinking of this how it
[49:44] struck me you know then they many times
[49:46] will have a a Raffles or or something
[49:49] like that you know everybody buys a
[49:51] raffle ticket and you put your name in
[49:53] there and and you know there's these
[49:57] great odds it could be who knows you
[49:59] know uh uh a hundred thousand people
[50:01] raffle or or you know 500 or whatever
[50:04] but all of a sudden you know uh uh if
[50:07] your name's been called
[50:10] you've been selected you've been chosen
[50:13] I remember uh uh back in the day when
[50:16] when I I used to do do sales for a
[50:19] fitness club and believe it or not I I
[50:22] used to have a jobs outside of what I do
[50:25] now my my kids I tell me yeah you know I
[50:27] had like 20 jobs before I started doing
[50:29] tree work like what
[50:30] so one of them was I was I was uh
[50:33] selling uh health care and it was kind
[50:35] of funny we always needed leads and
[50:36] people to call and they would have these
[50:38] boxes deposited all over the Metroplex
[50:41] and you could sign up for a two-week
[50:44] free uh a membership so we could get you
[50:46] in there and try to sell you
[50:48] welcome to find out what the what a lot
[50:50] of the salesmen would do they would just
[50:51] open up the phone book
[50:55] and say you've been selected you know
[50:57] those little boxes you see there and
[50:58] your name was turned in like man I
[51:00] didn't turn in my name you didn't turn
[51:02] on my I didn't know anything about it
[51:04] well you know what you didn't know
[51:05] anything about it but you've been
[51:07] elected and you've been chosen like what
[51:09] are you talking about there was a what
[51:10] yeah I'm going to have a bride in the
[51:12] end time and I have elected and I have
[51:14] chosen you and I have given you a
[51:16] promise that you would bring forth much
[51:18] fruit see you're the elected you're the
[51:20] ordained you're the chosen vessel that
[51:22] I've made a promise to
[51:25] you've been elected and you've been
[51:27] chosen for it
[51:29] so when we look into the Bible and we
[51:31] start to read there in Ephesians chapter
[51:33] 1 and and verse 4 it says according as
[51:35] he has chosen Us in him before the
[51:37] foundation of the world that we should
[51:39] be blameless before him in love oh we're
[51:42] going to be the blameless spotless bride
[51:44] and that that that and then you
[51:46] predestinated unto adoption
[51:50] these things become common to us
[51:53] like something that's just uh uh a
[51:56] phrase you know something that we're not
[51:58] earnestly contending for
[52:00] uh but but I as we move forward there
[52:03] there has been something that has come
[52:05] on display in the evening time to show
[52:08] the Bride of what these promises
[52:11] actually mean when they take on flesh
[52:14] it's not something that's left out there
[52:16] on the ether somewhere and you're just
[52:18] wondering well I guess I'll be what God
[52:21] made me someday no we have a pattern in
[52:23] the word we have scripture and we have
[52:25] end-time manifestations to show the
[52:28] bride exactly what she's going to be and
[52:30] there ought to be a heart crying the
[52:32] believer tonight that you're not going
[52:34] to stop short I'm going to make my
[52:36] calling an election sure that I produce
[52:39] everything that God has promised me for
[52:41] to produce because I see it in the word
[52:43] and I'm not going to stop short it's my
[52:45] inheritance
[52:47] there ought to be something in you
[52:49] that's hungering and thirsting for
[52:51] righteousness that's not going to stop
[52:52] short you're not going to back up you're
[52:54] not going to let the things of Lady
[52:56] you'll see and the things rob you of
[52:57] your time and your daily concentrated
[52:59] life living in the presence of the
[53:01] Shekinah Glory we got to move past the
[53:04] things of the world we gotta move past
[53:05] the flesh we got to get into that secret
[53:07] place we gotta break through the veil we
[53:10] gotta break through the barriers why
[53:11] because we've seen one live amongst us
[53:13] who broke through the denominational
[53:14] veils he broke through the barriers of
[53:17] Lady osia he broke through into the
[53:19] presence of God soaring in Heavenly
[53:21] places where all things are possible
[53:24] and that's your inheritance you've been
[53:26] elected you've been chosen to bring
[53:28] forth the fruit of the age
[53:31] Oh Glory to God
[53:35] oh let God do with your heart
[53:40] you move over into Ephesians uh chapter
[53:43] 2 I believe verse 10 we are his
[53:46] workmanship
[53:48] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[53:51] for ordained that we should walk in them
[53:54] the question is are you walking in them
[53:58] come on this is adoption hour
[54:01] this is the hour of the manifestation of
[54:04] the sons of God we know what it ought to
[54:06] look like
[54:08] we know what an overcomer looks like
[54:10] let's not play ignorant around here
[54:12] we've seen a sheath wave I say we've
[54:15] seen it well I must confess I didn't see
[54:16] it with my natural eyes
[54:18] I wasn't here uh that many years ago we
[54:22] see it in the word
[54:24] we saw it in the prophets a portion of
[54:27] the word we saw it in Jesus Christ the
[54:29] fullness of the word and by Divine
[54:31] promise at the revealing of the son of
[54:33] man we've seen the fullness of the word
[54:35] back in flesh again in our generation
[54:38] displaying what the word is
[54:43] come on
[54:47] that was so you could know what you're
[54:49] being called to be
[54:52] yeah
[54:54] they were first called Christians at
[54:57] Antioch
[54:58] because the life that was in Christ
[55:01] Hallelujah the sheath wave was raised up
[55:04] there if I be lifted up I will draw amen
[55:08] unto me and there The Mercy Seat was
[55:10] lifted up there on Calvary oh and the
[55:13] veil was written there was the mercy see
[55:16] hanging in plain view the sheath wave
[55:19] and it was way back to them on the day
[55:22] of Pentecost in the life that was in the
[55:24] sheath way was now back on the believer
[55:26] performing the same signs the same
[55:29] wonders
[55:30] the prophet of God says I long to see
[55:33] the days of ananias and Sapphire which
[55:35] sin would be called out at the back door
[55:39] have we stopped shark have we forgot
[55:42] what we've been called to
[55:46] have we been wooed
[55:48] bye lady Lucia
[55:50] have we been wooed by education have we
[55:54] been wooed by learning
[55:57] have we been trying to understand the
[56:00] message
[56:01] have we been trying to do two plus two
[56:03] equals four and we've missed the very
[56:06] person of the word
[56:09] let God speak to your heart right now
[56:13] the greatest battle ever thought is in
[56:15] your mind
[56:17] and it's easy for us to learn to to lean
[56:20] towards learning
[56:22] and understanding and trying to be able
[56:25] to to hold our own amongst the brethren
[56:30] come on
[56:32] come on you want to be able to sit down
[56:34] and when somebody starts to ask you
[56:36] questions
[56:37] you want to feel that you don't feel
[56:38] like a duck out of water
[56:40] I'd rather you feel like a duck out of
[56:43] water
[56:43] and say I don't know but I Lord reveal
[56:46] it to me
[56:47] but we settle for for for a mental
[56:51] understanding
[56:53] of the greatest thing that's ever struck
[56:55] Humanity in this generation oh Shake
[56:58] Yourself Church young people Shake
[57:01] Yourself we've allowed ourselves to sink
[57:03] into a denomination into a religion and
[57:06] we allow ourselves to accept
[57:08] terminologies for the very Life of
[57:10] Christ living out in the individual
[57:13] I know what I'm talking about
[57:19] we get complacent we get satisfied
[57:22] oh foolish Galatians
[57:25] having begun in the spirit are you now
[57:28] perfected with all of your learning
[57:31] are you now perfected with your works
[57:33] are you so easily wooed away from that
[57:37] hunger and thirst for God to continue to
[57:40] reveal himself to you that you've gotten
[57:42] a little bit of learning and now you've
[57:44] gotten puffed up with your position and
[57:46] your ability to hold down the front row
[57:48] at church and be able to spit a few
[57:50] lyrics to make some people realize you
[57:52] believe the message or are you in a
[57:54] daily communion in a consecrated life in
[57:57] the Shekinah Glory where you've broke
[57:59] through the veil and it's dropped down
[58:01] behind you and you're hit away
[58:04] oh
[58:08] man I am the Vine
[58:11] here are the branches
[58:14] where is the fruit boring
[58:18] it's not in the Vine
[58:20] it's in the branch
[58:23] second Peter would say wherefore the
[58:25] rather Brethren give diligence to make
[58:27] your calling and your elections sure
[58:29] because if you do these things you shall
[58:31] never fail
[58:33] what kind of results are you getting
[58:36] what kind of fruit are you bearing in
[58:38] your life
[58:39] you want to give diligence to that
[58:42] we're called to be fruitful
[58:44] we're called to be christ-like
[58:48] we're called to go on to perfection
[58:52] in John 15 8 we'll just have a lot of
[58:54] scriptures and quote to move through
[59:01] I believe that's what we had read in our
[59:03] text it says wherefore the rather and
[59:05] give tillages to make
[59:07] well it says in 15 8 hearing is my
[59:10] father glorified that you bear much
[59:13] fruit
[59:15] so shall you be my disciples well look
[59:17] we know the fruit of the spirit is it's
[59:19] love and joy and peace and
[59:21] long-suffering gentleness goodness
[59:23] kindness Faith meekness tempers those
[59:25] things we want to see those fruits
[59:27] abounding in our life
[59:33] Jesus would give a parable it might be
[59:35] Matthew 5 I'm not sure but uh no it'll
[59:39] be a little later than that but Jesus
[59:40] gives the parable he says you know it's
[59:42] like this the the the vineyard uh the
[59:44] master of the vineyard he came out and
[59:46] said hey every year I come to this fruit
[59:49] tree
[59:50] and it's not burying any fruit
[59:54] he said why why in cumberth the pew
[1:00:00] why take up the place on the church pew
[1:00:04] if it's just fill in a dead spot
[1:00:08] why are we going to encumber the ground
[1:00:11] why why are we gonna I encumber if this
[1:00:14] flesh if it ain't gonna produce any
[1:00:16] fruit let's just get rid of the thing
[1:00:20] but what if the husbandman of the
[1:00:22] vineyard say no
[1:00:24] let's don't get rid of it now but let me
[1:00:27] dig it let me dung it let me give it
[1:00:29] some attention let me make the calling
[1:00:32] an election sure let me deal with it as
[1:00:34] a son
[1:00:36] let me go have a talk with them Lord
[1:00:39] let's not get rid of them but but let
[1:00:41] the Holy Spirit come by his way uh let
[1:00:44] us start to speak to his heart let me
[1:00:46] start to deal with him let me start to
[1:00:48] point out his air and where he's missed
[1:00:50] the mark and how he's going down the
[1:00:52] wrong path let me start to deal with
[1:00:54] them Lord let me dig it let me dunk it
[1:00:56] let me create an atmosphere around the
[1:00:58] seed that it can break and bring forth
[1:01:01] the fruit that you desire
[1:01:04] you gotta be that one
[1:01:09] and before you can be that one for
[1:01:11] others you gotta be that for yourself I
[1:01:14] ain't saying that you got to do it but
[1:01:16] you gotta look to him and let him do it
[1:01:18] in you
[1:01:19] the prophet of God say the problem is is
[1:01:21] we're too strong
[1:01:23] we're too Headstrong
[1:01:28] I think one of the things we lacked the
[1:01:30] most
[1:01:32] is meekness and humility
[1:01:37] his presence produces meekness and
[1:01:40] humility
[1:01:43] that Prophet lived in it
[1:01:46] how could he be lifted up
[1:01:49] when he was in a constant communion with
[1:01:53] the great creator
[1:01:54] how could he ever be lifted up
[1:01:59] within that presence
[1:02:02] oh
[1:02:03] we saw what that presence did it was a
[1:02:05] discerner of the thought intent of the
[1:02:06] heart
[1:02:08] nothing was hid think of how one's felt
[1:02:12] around them
[1:02:15] this is whether biscal would testify of
[1:02:17] driving in the car there and the angel
[1:02:19] of the Lord come in
[1:02:22] the prophet of God would say
[1:02:26] he come to me over a thousand times but
[1:02:28] every time I'd like to die
[1:02:34] I ain't saying every one of us are
[1:02:36] called to live in a presence like that
[1:02:37] but we're all called to live in his
[1:02:39] presence
[1:02:40] we're all called to receive all his
[1:02:42] blessings and I know when you get alone
[1:02:44] into his presence oh he's a dissolver of
[1:02:48] doubts
[1:02:49] he's a sober of problems
[1:02:52] he knows how to bind the Brokenhearted
[1:02:55] he knows how to comfort those that are
[1:02:58] comfortless he knows how to deliver
[1:03:00] those that are in captivity
[1:03:03] if you could just come into His presence
[1:03:07] see it's in his presence where things
[1:03:09] change
[1:03:11] it's in his presence where there's life
[1:03:15] take that manna
[1:03:18] from out behind the veil
[1:03:20] and it was death
[1:03:22] it was dead substance Aaron Drive take
[1:03:26] it out from behind the veil and it was
[1:03:28] just a stick
[1:03:31] but back in there Hallelujah
[1:03:36] in that presence
[1:03:38] it was life it was the sustaining of
[1:03:42] life it brought forth
[1:03:46] oh
[1:03:47] that's what's come to the believer today
[1:03:51] the Shekinah Glory has come
[1:03:55] that you could live in there
[1:04:00] this isn't some promised word way out
[1:04:03] there that that can never be obtainable
[1:04:07] but this is this is we're talking about
[1:04:09] the fruits of your election something
[1:04:11] that you've been chosen to be a part of
[1:04:17] we could take time on the talents the
[1:04:20] parable about the talents how each one
[1:04:22] was given a talent
[1:04:25] and we could spend some time there
[1:04:28] on the talents and how one would just
[1:04:30] bury it
[1:04:31] well I didn't want to lose it I didn't I
[1:04:34] was afraid I I knew you gave me one
[1:04:36] talent I didn't want to lose it what are
[1:04:38] you doing with the gift of God
[1:04:40] what are you doing with the message of
[1:04:42] the hour
[1:04:46] God's given you a vaccine
[1:04:50] he's giving you the Cure
[1:04:54] all this death and darkness and
[1:04:57] everything you see on the Rampage he has
[1:05:00] entrusted you with the very token
[1:05:04] the very vaccine for the condition
[1:05:07] what are you doing with it
[1:05:11] what are what are we doing with the
[1:05:13] message
[1:05:18] you you got to store it on your cell
[1:05:20] phone
[1:05:23] what
[1:05:25] you got it in tapes and books you got it
[1:05:28] in the Bible Elena what are you doing
[1:05:30] with it acting like the world
[1:05:32] going to the same places as the world
[1:05:35] listening to the same Christian rock as
[1:05:37] the world
[1:05:40] come on
[1:05:43] I'm talking about what is the fruits of
[1:05:45] your inaction what you have been called
[1:05:47] to be
[1:05:50] now we got some places to go so by God's
[1:05:52] grace we'll move there
[1:05:54] prophet of God would say and you must be
[1:05:56] born again when you're born again
[1:05:59] God vindicates you
[1:06:03] well chew on that a little while
[1:06:07] when you're born again God vindicates
[1:06:11] you

[1:06:45] really me but what he's done in me
[1:06:49] you know the old song you can't cross
[1:06:51] the bloodline
[1:06:53] huh
[1:06:55] you say I'm the purchased possession
[1:06:57] I'm the Royal seed I'm the Bride of
[1:07:01] Jesus Christ and I have been born again
[1:07:03] and he is going to vindicate me not
[1:07:07] really me but the word because I am his
[1:07:09] word
[1:07:10] well we'll get there in a little while
[1:07:12] if you really find out who you are what
[1:07:15] you've been chosen for what the fruits
[1:07:16] of your election really is
[1:07:18] when you're born again God vindicates
[1:07:21] you
[1:07:22] well we might be a while tonight but I I

[1:07:32] maybe we can just have a little good
[1:07:34] time tonight

[1:07:39] for your prayers but we fly out tomorrow

[1:07:54] Sunday and fly back on Monday so we'll
[1:07:56] covet your prayers
[1:07:58] but if if there was any place I'd rather
[1:08:01] be it'd be right here with my brothers
[1:08:02] and sisters at home
[1:08:04] so when you're born again God vindicates
[1:08:06] you that's how God vindicates all of his
[1:08:09] nature what
[1:08:11] by there
[1:08:13] fruit
[1:08:14] that's the way he vindicates his
[1:08:16] ministry that's right all of his
[1:08:18] servants are Vindicated the same way he
[1:08:20] vindicates nature how do you know it's a
[1:08:22] peach tree because it brings peaches how
[1:08:25] do you know it's an apple tree it's
[1:08:26] bearing apples
[1:08:28] how do you know it's a Christian
[1:08:33] signs bear from it
[1:08:36] Christian Life comes out of it
[1:08:38] how do you know he's a teacher the word
[1:08:41] comes from him how do you know he's a
[1:08:42] prophet the word comes through him Bears
[1:08:44] record Vindication it proves itself how
[1:08:47] does it become that when it dies and
[1:08:50] becomes one
[1:08:55] that's right when we die and become a
[1:08:58] new creature in Christ Jesus it gets us
[1:09:01] with our calling
[1:09:04] we stay with our calling
[1:09:07] now now don't let that move on by
[1:09:11] when we die and become a new creature in
[1:09:14] Christ Jesus it gets us with our calling
[1:09:18] we stay with our calling
[1:09:22] the cycle of Revival and death is over
[1:09:26] I'm sorry
[1:09:28] but when you're born again
[1:09:31] and the Holy Spirit gets you with your
[1:09:34] calling and you stay with your calling
[1:09:37] the cycle of Revival and death is over
[1:09:42] sure we're gonna have temptations we're
[1:09:45] gonna go through trials we're going to
[1:09:47] go through hardships but the cycle of
[1:09:50] Revival and death is over because you
[1:09:54] have been born again and it brings you
[1:09:57] into your calling and you stay with your
[1:10:01] calling
[1:10:02] why because you have now entered into
[1:10:06] his rest
[1:10:08] and when we enter into his rest then we
[1:10:12] cease from our own works
[1:10:15] right
[1:10:18] you've entered into the secret place
[1:10:22] sure we want to have a pattern of good
[1:10:25] works and that's good
[1:10:27] but we want to be led by the spirit
[1:10:32] the prophet goes on to say the fruits of
[1:10:34] the spirit follow us when we are his
[1:10:36] servants
[1:10:38] when we are born again the fruits of
[1:10:40] Christ life follow us that's right how
[1:10:43] do you know it's a peach tree it gots
[1:10:45] peaches how do you know he's a Christian
[1:10:48] he acts like Christ he walks like Christ
[1:10:51] he talks like Christ he lives like
[1:10:55] Christ
[1:10:56] above sin
[1:11:01] Victorious
[1:11:04] now why allow the devil to rob you
[1:11:08] from your inheritance
[1:11:11] because right now
[1:11:13] you're already connecting dots of things
[1:11:15] in your life
[1:11:19] sure Satan wants to use that as
[1:11:20] condemnation
[1:11:22] but those very things that are flashing
[1:11:24] before you are flashing before you
[1:11:26] because it's something you want to have
[1:11:28] the victory over
[1:11:30] it's something you want to live above
[1:11:33] and if that's something that you desire
[1:11:35] and it's in the word then don't justify
[1:11:39] a condition of a repeated cycle
[1:11:44] you say Lord I that this is what I've
[1:11:47] been elected for
[1:11:49] and I have been called to be christ-like
[1:11:52] to walk like Christ to talk like Christ
[1:11:55] to live like Christ to live above sin to
[1:11:58] be victorious
[1:12:00] what does he do say see see what I've
[1:12:02] done no Christ didn't do that he gave
[1:12:05] all praise to the father that's right
[1:12:06] that's how you know it by their fruits
[1:12:09] you shall know them
[1:12:12] so it's what Christ is doing in you and
[1:12:16] through you what he's doing in your life
[1:12:18] and not all only what he's doing in your
[1:12:20] life but what he's doing in your life
[1:12:22] through you for others see there's where
[1:12:24] we want to really get to the place to
[1:12:26] where we're so born again and the the
[1:12:30] cycle of Revival and death is over that
[1:12:33] now you've become a prisoner of Christ
[1:12:35] and now you're the vehicle that God
[1:12:37] drives down to the crisis
[1:12:40] come on
[1:12:42] I have needs to go by Samaria God is
[1:12:45] calling a bride that you would be the
[1:12:48] very body
[1:12:50] you are the body
[1:12:52] you are the body of Christ The Headstone
[1:12:56] right so you're going to be the vehicle
[1:12:59] you're going to be the body that God
[1:13:01] wants to use to bring forth his word in
[1:13:04] this age
[1:13:11] but that takes a surrendered life
[1:13:15] and I think that's where a lot of us
[1:13:18] myself included we find ourselves coming
[1:13:21] up short
[1:13:22] is we're not surrendering
[1:13:25] we're not Redeeming the time
[1:13:28] there's such a vastness of this word
[1:13:31] that God is wanting to pour into you
[1:13:34] and we're only scratching the very
[1:13:37] surface
[1:13:38] look at the prophet's life
[1:13:42] the prophet would say it it wasn't me
[1:13:46] it was what I surrendered myself to
[1:13:51] he said oh no it wasn't the seventh
[1:13:53] angel
[1:13:55] it was the mighty Angel it was the son
[1:13:58] of man
[1:14:00] he said I'm just a mute hey I like the
[1:14:03] microphone I I'm just one that he spoke
[1:14:05] through see it was something that he
[1:14:07] surrendered to
[1:14:10] him he had a part to play
[1:14:12] you have a part to play
[1:14:15] and it has to be something that you
[1:14:17] surrender yourself to
[1:14:19] look You Gotta Lose Your Mind
[1:14:22] you gotta lose your thinking and that's
[1:14:25] what has come to us as the very mind of
[1:14:28] God
[1:14:29] that that we could forget about our
[1:14:31] thoughts and our ideas and we we could
[1:14:34] come into contact and come into a union
[1:14:37] with this word that it would be the very
[1:14:39] governing factor of our life that we
[1:14:42] would be so submitted and so surrendered
[1:14:45] and so in the Channel with him that his
[1:14:48] very mind would be living through us
[1:14:54] have we heard it so much that we're just
[1:14:57] we we we're not even making our calling
[1:15:00] and elections we're not even hungering
[1:15:02] for these things because oh brother
[1:15:03] Matthew it's been 60 years and and
[1:15:06] preachers have been saying the same
[1:15:07] thing over and over and over and I
[1:15:09] listen to the tapes over and over and
[1:15:11] well Faith come by hearing
[1:15:14] we need to hear it over and over and
[1:15:16] over and over
[1:15:17] because faith comes by hearing the word
[1:15:20] and I I this bride Hallelujah she's not
[1:15:23] going to want that one word slip
[1:15:25] Glory it was by one word that Eve caused
[1:15:30] the fall of all man but this bride by
[1:15:33] every word spoken out of the mouth of
[1:15:35] God we will not let one word slip
[1:15:39] because you're ordained for it you are
[1:15:42] predestinated for it it's the very
[1:15:44] fruits of your election to bring forth
[1:15:46] the word of the age
[1:15:51] well
[1:15:53] brother Matthew I hear our position I
[1:15:55] hear adoption I hear manifestation I
[1:15:58] hear predestination election third pool
[1:16:01] I need something I can use brother
[1:16:03] Matthew all of these buzzwords ain't
[1:16:05] doing me any good I need something yeah
[1:16:09] yeah that's true
[1:16:11] you need something
[1:16:14] kind of like Little Junior
[1:16:18] you know the the storms are flashing and
[1:16:20] the Lightning's going he come out of bed
[1:16:22] and say Mom I'm scared it's the
[1:16:24] lightning Junior go back upstairs
[1:16:27] go get in bed and you know being a good
[1:16:30] little boy he went back got in bed and
[1:16:32] there comes the lightning and thunder
[1:16:33] and it's it's flashing and he said Mama
[1:16:36] Mama and being a good old mom she comes
[1:16:38] up there what is it Junior
[1:16:40] I'm scared well Junior what are you
[1:16:43] scared about well it's the Thunder and
[1:16:44] it's the darkness well you know Jesus
[1:16:46] loves you and he protects you
[1:16:48] say yeah Mama I know that but I want a
[1:16:52] god with skin on it
[1:16:55] I want a god with skin on where you know
[1:16:57] that's what you've been called to be
[1:17:00] Hallelujah you've been called to be god
[1:17:02] with skin on it
[1:17:05] but the purpose of the sheath wave in
[1:17:07] our generation was god with skin on it
[1:17:10] to show you that if that was the first
[1:17:12] one to maturity a god with skin on it
[1:17:17] they call you Gods who the word of the
[1:17:19] Lord comes to well I got news for you
[1:17:21] the word of the Lord has come to the
[1:17:23] bride ye are Gods because the word of
[1:17:27] the Lord has come to you you are the
[1:17:30] very god with skin on it
[1:17:35] it's what you've been called to
[1:17:38] when you come to him
[1:17:42] some of us just need to get desperate
[1:17:47] we just need to get desperate
[1:17:51] are we living come on
[1:17:54] are we living like the rapture
[1:17:57] is on
[1:18:00] let's just take inventory
[1:18:03] matter of fact why don't we all open up
[1:18:05] our cell phones and look at the apps
[1:18:08] on our phone
[1:18:10] let's look at our internet history
[1:18:13] and see if the fruits of your life
[1:18:16] testify
[1:18:24] well come on Church
[1:18:27] what are we doing
[1:18:28] I know I get on my hobby horses but
[1:18:31] but we need to
[1:18:33] are we living like he's coming
[1:18:36] today
[1:18:38] I think that's the paradox
[1:18:40] if you don't realize he's he's already
[1:18:42] started
[1:18:43] he's already here
[1:18:45] his coming has already ascended
[1:18:49] are we living like we're in the Rapture
[1:18:51] age are we living like we're in the
[1:18:53] bright age look we're talking about
[1:18:54] fruits of your election
[1:18:58] so so we want to do all these big things
[1:19:00] but what about the little foxes that
[1:19:03] spoil the vine
[1:19:05] we're wanting to be this Great Mighty
[1:19:07] Victorious Church well ask yourself what
[1:19:09] would Jesus do
[1:19:11] and move on Down the Line
[1:19:14] to people who manifested the word for
[1:19:16] the age and ask yourselves would they do
[1:19:18] that
[1:19:20] would the prophet be found around these
[1:19:22] things would the prophet be found doing
[1:19:24] that
[1:19:26] better yet where I get totally smitten
[1:19:29] to the core is we say that Jesus is in
[1:19:32] US
[1:19:33] we see that Jesus is with us
[1:19:35] but I wonder if he was sitting in the
[1:19:38] chair next to you
[1:19:40] if we would do half the things that we
[1:19:42] do
[1:19:43] now we're just dealing with unbelief I'm
[1:19:45] sorry
[1:19:48] well we just got a hammer at home
[1:19:50] because we got a good place to go
[1:19:52] but we we might as well get it all let's
[1:19:54] just get all the sin out
[1:19:56] oh we got a Rapture to get to we got a
[1:19:59] body change to get to we got Brothers to
[1:20:02] save we got sisters to say we got
[1:20:04] prodigal sons we got people who need
[1:20:06] healing in their body let's get this
[1:20:08] show on their own I'm tired of playing
[1:20:10] Church up one month and down the next
[1:20:13] this revival today come on what's the
[1:20:16] matter with us has the mighty Angel come
[1:20:18] down as the Capstone descendants and
[1:20:21] Grace Grace are you in a union with him
[1:20:24] then live like it act like it talk like
[1:20:29] it walk like it believe like it
[1:20:35] be that Victorious church that God has
[1:20:38] called you to be
[1:20:40] when you come to him don't come as a
[1:20:42] floater
[1:20:43] I'll go up and try it and see if it
[1:20:45] works you'll never get nowhere but when
[1:20:47] you come with this kind of determination
[1:20:49] that you have sold out locks talking
[1:20:51] Barrel when you're tired of the world
[1:20:54] and sin and unbelief and frustrations
[1:20:58] and doubts and come to the Living God
[1:21:01] with an anchor surely tightened in the
[1:21:04] Rock of Ages the holy spirit is here to
[1:21:07] pull you into the presence of the Living
[1:21:10] God that will give you that faith that
[1:21:13] overcome anything there is in the world
[1:21:15] sickness disease and even death itself
[1:21:21] hey do I need to read it again

[1:25:14] I got all my radio stations already
[1:25:17] programmed
[1:25:20] I got you know the vanilla Smith the new
[1:25:22] car smell in this
[1:25:24] are you so blind
[1:25:29] God has a storehouse
[1:25:32] a new life
[1:25:36] Joy beyond measure
[1:25:39] joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:25:45] we just need to surrender to the message
[1:25:50] just need to surrender to it
[1:25:53] I think some of us you know this thought
[1:25:54] struck my heart
[1:25:56] some of us don't realize there's a
[1:25:57] bounty out on you
[1:26:00] you ever you know they have some shows
[1:26:02] out there big dog
[1:26:04] the Bounty Hunter
[1:26:07] and if you skip bail what's gonna happen
[1:26:09] the big dog
[1:26:11] is Gonna Come chasing you
[1:26:14] they call them bounty hunters
[1:26:17] so for view that don't know this
[1:26:20] if you get in trouble with the law
[1:26:21] there's a price that you got to pay to
[1:26:23] get out of jail
[1:26:26] and it'll be a big big fee a hundred
[1:26:28] thousand dollars
[1:26:30] well now there's places called a bails
[1:26:32] bondsman
[1:26:33] they will kind of vet you and say hey
[1:26:36] you know I'll put up the money for you
[1:26:38] it'll cost you ten percent you give me
[1:26:40] ten thousand dollars
[1:26:42] I'll give the court the rest of the
[1:26:44] money
[1:26:45] and it it's it's a it's a bail so as
[1:26:49] long as you come back to court
[1:26:51] you get all the money back
[1:26:54] but if you skip your court date that
[1:26:56] bail bondsman
[1:26:58] is out ninety thousand dollars
[1:27:01] and there's one way
[1:27:03] that he can get his money back
[1:27:06] if he can get you back in that court or
[1:27:10] get you arrested so what does he do he
[1:27:12] he hires an outside agent called a
[1:27:15] bounty hunter
[1:27:16] and it says look this guy skipped bail
[1:27:20] and he's on the run and I want you to go
[1:27:22] get him
[1:27:24] and I want you to bring them back to the
[1:27:26] court so I can get my deposit back I can
[1:27:29] get my money back well I got to thinking
[1:27:31] about that you know some of us have just
[1:27:33] skipped bail Christ paid the price for
[1:27:35] your Sid he paid to get you out of jail
[1:27:38] and he just wants you to come to the
[1:27:40] court because you know what's going to
[1:27:41] happen at the court
[1:27:43] hey it's gonna you're gonna be forgiven
[1:27:45] Case Closed justify it's over but all
[1:27:48] you're doing is running you're just
[1:27:51] running from the very source of all of
[1:27:54] your joy the source of all of your
[1:27:56] deliverance and little did you know
[1:27:57] there's a bounty out on you I think it's
[1:27:59] just time you surrender to the message
[1:28:01] of the hour and say I'm done running
[1:28:05] I'm ready to to surrender myself to the
[1:28:09] word and whatever God wants to do in my
[1:28:13] life
[1:28:18] that's where it gets hard
[1:28:21] because we have dreams
[1:28:23] we have aspirations
[1:28:25] we got this boy we got this girl we got
[1:28:27] this school we got this degree
[1:28:30] and all of these things that we want to
[1:28:31] do
[1:28:35] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:28:39] scripture says in Revelations 3 19 as
[1:28:42] many as I love I rebuked and chasten
[1:28:44] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:28:48] I say some of you as we move towards the
[1:28:51] home stretch here
[1:28:54] time to repent
[1:28:58] trying to repent time to turn yourself
[1:29:00] in
[1:29:03] hey correction starts at the house of
[1:29:05] God
[1:29:07] if we ever get to the place where we
[1:29:09] don't need to repent
[1:29:10] and we feel like we just got it all
[1:29:12] buttoned up something wrong
[1:29:14] something's wrong
[1:29:16] but if we can just humble ourselves in
[1:29:18] his presence
[1:29:19] in an atmosphere like this and say Lord
[1:29:21] I realize I'm living below my privileges
[1:29:23] I realize Lord I believe this message I
[1:29:25] believe what I'm hearing but I'm not
[1:29:27] seeing the fruits of this message in my
[1:29:29] life and I need to repent
[1:29:32] Lord I need to repent I believe this
[1:29:34] message Lord I I believe what I'm
[1:29:36] hearing but Lord I'm not seeing the
[1:29:38] fruits of this message in my life Lord
[1:29:40] forgive me
[1:29:42] But Here I Am Lord
[1:29:45] maybe I didn't surrender in the past
[1:29:47] maybe I didn't come Lock Stock and bear
[1:29:49] like in the past but Lord here I am I'm
[1:29:52] willing and I'm ready because Lord the
[1:29:54] Rapture could be tomorrow and I don't
[1:29:56] want to miss it I want to make my
[1:29:58] calling an election sure
[1:30:01] the prophet of God would say in
[1:30:03] adoptions verily I say unto you you
[1:30:05] that's little gods
[1:30:07] now we want to move towards the other
[1:30:09] side
[1:30:10] we want to we want to start moving
[1:30:13] towards look we've repented we're making
[1:30:15] things right we want to start and start
[1:30:17] now seeing the fruits of this word in
[1:30:20] our lives we want to start being an
[1:30:22] expectation for it
[1:30:25] you've got to be an expectation you get
[1:30:27] what you expect
[1:30:28] right
[1:30:29] if you're just satisfied with the way
[1:30:31] you're living and not expecting
[1:30:33] something further to unfold in you then
[1:30:36] you become complacent verily I send you
[1:30:39] you that's little Gods if you say to
[1:30:41] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:30:43] in your heart but believe that you have
[1:30:45] what you have said will come to pass you
[1:30:47] can have what you said
[1:30:49] go right back to Genesis to the original
[1:30:52] what is it now the world in nature is
[1:30:55] groaning it's crying everything's moving
[1:30:59] what for the manifestation of the sons
[1:31:02] of God when true Sons born Sons field
[1:31:06] Sons speak and their word is backed I
[1:31:09] believe we're on the border right now
[1:31:12] that's
[1:31:14] 1960. that's May 22nd in the evening
[1:31:17] time
[1:31:19] that was a few years ago and he said
[1:31:21] we're right on the border right now I
[1:31:25] believe we're living in the hour to
[1:31:27] where the very things that the prophet
[1:31:29] has spoken the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:31:32] now coming into maturity where we are
[1:31:35] seeing these things before our very
[1:31:38] highs I'm in expectation of it I am
[1:31:41] looking for it and I don't want to stop
[1:31:43] somebody from getting there
[1:31:46] prophet of God said if my faith can't go
[1:31:48] where Enoch don't let me get in somebody
[1:31:50] else's way
[1:31:53] don't justify and make excuses well he
[1:31:56] said at this and it really doesn't mean
[1:31:58] that no I believe it's I think you can
[1:32:00] speak the word and all of heaven will
[1:32:02] back it up that's what we've been
[1:32:04] restored back to
[1:32:08] that's what we're speaking on is you're
[1:32:10] elected to bring forth the fruit for
[1:32:12] your age
[1:32:13] or the season
[1:32:15] don't saddle for anything less
[1:32:19] don't settle for a feeling don't settle
[1:32:21] for an emotion
[1:32:24] don't settle for just a pattern of good
[1:32:25] works
[1:32:28] don't don't
[1:32:31] come so far and they say well you know
[1:32:33] this is as far as I'm going to come
[1:32:35] so I'll just manufacture something
[1:32:38] that's but that was the problem all down
[1:32:40] through the Old Testament
[1:32:42] Prophet said eve couldn't wait
[1:32:44] right Eve couldn't wait
[1:32:46] she could wait for a husband
[1:32:50] Abraham and Sarah Sarah just she got
[1:32:52] soap you know well I can't do anything
[1:32:54] about it here's Hagar
[1:32:57] could wait
[1:32:58] a Madman
[1:33:01] if we're not careful come on you you
[1:33:03] hear what the prophet's saying if we're
[1:33:05] not careful
[1:33:07] and have a single eye for this message
[1:33:11] and for what we've seen produced from
[1:33:13] this message if we start getting our eye
[1:33:16] on something else we'll lean towards a
[1:33:18] substitute we'll lean we'll lean towards
[1:33:21] towards
[1:33:22] some uh uh substitute for what God is
[1:33:26] wanting to bring to pass in you
[1:33:29] but we got to be like Abraham and
[1:33:31] stagger not at the promise
[1:33:34] say I don't know when but it's coming I
[1:33:37] don't know when but it's coming I don't
[1:33:39] know when but it's here it's here right
[1:33:41] now it's for you
[1:33:43] don't settle for anything less the
[1:33:45] scripture says in First John 3 2 Be
[1:33:47] Loved now we are the sons of God
[1:33:51] it does not appear what we shall be but
[1:33:54] we do know that when he shall appear we
[1:33:56] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:33:59] as he is well I want to tell you
[1:34:01] something don't miss his appearing
[1:34:04] don't let the presence of God go
[1:34:07] unrecognized
[1:34:10] now we're coming down to our day we're
[1:34:13] coming down to Luke 17 30.
[1:34:15] we're coming down to the revealing of
[1:34:17] the son of man don't let the presence of
[1:34:19] God go unrecognized
[1:34:22] don't let his appearing go unrecognized
[1:34:27] what was it that happened to Abraham and
[1:34:30] Sarah there on the plains of memory it
[1:34:32] was his appearing
[1:34:34] God appearing in the form of a man
[1:34:37] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:34:39] Art and speaking the word
[1:34:42] who was Melchizedek looking for
[1:34:46] Hallelujah
[1:34:48] he didn't come up there and say where's
[1:34:50] Abraham
[1:34:52] he came to that tent and said where's
[1:34:54] your wife
[1:34:55] where is Sarah
[1:34:59] and when he spoke
[1:35:02] he said according to the time of life
[1:35:06] Sarah was going to conceive and bring
[1:35:08] forth the promised word
[1:35:12] the prophet of God would say in the in
[1:35:14] the unveiling of God he said the
[1:35:15] Shekinah Glory manifest him
[1:35:18] it brings forth the Word of Promise
[1:35:21] right out to you
[1:35:23] that's the reason that he had to Veil
[1:35:25] Moses face because in him was the word
[1:35:30] she give me about 10 or 12 more minutes
[1:35:33] he veiled Jesus as a humble little man
[1:35:37] to keep them from seeing Jehovah I hope
[1:35:40] you can
[1:35:41] put two and two together
[1:35:43] he's not going to come right out and say
[1:35:44] it
[1:35:48] he veiled Jesus as a humble little man
[1:35:51] to keep them from seeing Jehovah and he
[1:35:54] veils himself today in Earthen vessels
[1:35:58] with the Shekinah
[1:36:02] the outside looks like a bunch of Holy
[1:36:04] Rollers old Badger skins
[1:36:07] but the inside hides the Shekinah Glory
[1:36:13] what did Malachi 4 5 come to do it came
[1:36:17] to pull you into it came to bring you
[1:36:21] into that secret place I'll meet you in
[1:36:25] there but you see we got to stay in the
[1:36:28] presence we got to stay in the word we
[1:36:30] gotta lay in the presence of the Sun
[1:36:34] because outside of this message outside
[1:36:37] of God veils himself in his word
[1:36:45] understand that
[1:36:47] Luke 17 30 was his word
[1:36:51] and he veiled himself in it
[1:36:54] when it comes the season
[1:36:57] when the a when it comes time for the
[1:36:59] season of the word god veils himself in
[1:37:03] it
[1:37:04] search the scriptures in them you think
[1:37:07] you have eternal life and they are they
[1:37:09] that testify of me
[1:37:12] it was the very word the very word that
[1:37:16] had been prophesied now taking on skin
[1:37:20] God's always failed himself in skin
[1:37:25] can't you see it
[1:37:27] there that Pillar of Fire that came down
[1:37:32] that logos that was caught in that
[1:37:34] burning bush
[1:37:37] and Moses turned aside to see it
[1:37:41] he said Moses I have come down
[1:37:45] I have come down but then what did he do
[1:37:47] he sent Moses the prophet of God picks
[1:37:49] it up and says look he said I have come
[1:37:51] down it was God going in the form of a
[1:37:54] man
[1:37:56] and then he showed that in the time when
[1:37:58] that Pillar of Fire came down there
[1:38:00] behind Badger skins in the temple never
[1:38:03] to come out again showing that he's
[1:38:05] veiled behind skins until John saw it on
[1:38:09] the Jordan River descending upon the
[1:38:11] Lamb of God
[1:38:14] veils himself behind skin
[1:38:18] but when you come out of that presence
[1:38:21] he veils himself in his word
[1:38:23] look out this message has to become
[1:38:26] alive
[1:38:26] this message produces his presence
[1:38:29] Hallelujah
[1:38:31] Hallelujah this message produces his
[1:38:34] presence
[1:38:35] and outside of that what happens outside
[1:38:38] of the present a bunch of Wiggle tails
[1:38:40] and death gets in
[1:38:42] and that's the problem we got today a
[1:38:45] lot of people have gotten out of the
[1:38:47] presence of the message they've mixed a
[1:38:49] bunch of man's Creeds and ideas and
[1:38:51] brother branna meant this and he meant
[1:38:53] that and I'll tell you what the
[1:38:55] interpretation is and they've tried to
[1:38:57] manhandle the word of God but this word
[1:38:59] is unhandled by man it is the Virgin
[1:39:02] word of God that has come to the Bride
[1:39:05] of Jesus Christ if you'll just stay in
[1:39:07] its presence if you'll just feed on it
[1:39:09] and lay in the presence of the sun
[1:39:11] you'll bring forth the fruit of the word
[1:39:15] it's what you're elected to it's what
[1:39:18] you're called to
[1:39:20] if we walk in the light
[1:39:24] as he is in the light
[1:39:26] we have Fellowship one with another
[1:39:29] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us
[1:39:31] from all sin oh I'm running out of time
[1:39:35] but there that day on Calvary
[1:39:38] when the veil was rent
[1:39:40] there was The Mercy Seat
[1:39:43] hanging in plain view for all men to see
[1:39:46] what was it it was the word made flesh
[1:39:51] I want to ask you what has come to you
[1:39:55] The Mercy Seat
[1:39:57] the word made flashes come to the bride
[1:40:02] that you too
[1:40:05] could live in the Shekinah Glory
[1:40:09] the prophet would say this
[1:40:13] in the Rapture God's word is original
[1:40:17] it's the word
[1:40:20] and it has to bring forth its kind
[1:40:24] it's kind in its season
[1:40:31] elected
[1:40:33] predestinated by the father God
[1:40:37] so by God's grace we'll just try to
[1:40:38] close along these lines just look at
[1:40:41] look at
[1:40:43] Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:40:46] oh
[1:40:48] of those Patriarchs
[1:40:51] all of those Heroes of Faith we're
[1:40:55] living out the word in their season
[1:40:59] Abel
[1:41:01] Abel was elected
[1:41:04] oh yes he was
[1:41:07] he was elected
[1:41:09] he knocked he was elected
[1:41:11] no law he was elected
[1:41:14] Abraham he was elected
[1:41:16] we're talking about fruits
[1:41:19] of your election you want to see fruits
[1:41:21] of your election look into Hebrews 11.
[1:41:26] by faith
[1:41:28] Hallelujah
[1:41:31] by faith Abel
[1:41:34] offered a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:41:37] Cain
[1:41:39] why could Abel do that
[1:41:43] he was elected
[1:41:49] faith is a gift
[1:41:52] that's any man should boast
[1:41:55] that ought to produce such a humility in
[1:41:57] the pride
[1:42:00] how can we be so lifted up
[1:42:03] and look down on other people just
[1:42:05] because they can't catch
[1:42:07] the gift of God to us
[1:42:10] your heart should break for him
[1:42:13] you should pray for him and say oh God
[1:42:15] if you're willing Lord
[1:42:17] reveal yourself to him Lord is there
[1:42:19] something I can do to impart life Lord
[1:42:22] they were good to me
[1:42:24] now we're talking about fruits of
[1:42:26] election
[1:42:29] by faith Enoch by faith Abraham
[1:42:34] faith comes by hearing the word
[1:42:37] that those were all fruits of their
[1:42:40] election
[1:42:42] they were all playing out their part in
[1:42:45] the great drama
[1:42:47] so those are all patterns in the word
[1:42:50] look we're coming down to our hour
[1:42:52] put your seatbelt on
[1:42:54] you you you're you know it's like being
[1:42:56] in the lineup right anybody ever seen a
[1:43:00] baseball game
[1:43:02] you might be back ninth
[1:43:04] and sometimes back ninth you don't feel
[1:43:06] too good because you're ninth like that
[1:43:09] means out of nine people
[1:43:13] if there was 12 you might have been 12
[1:43:14] but since there's only nine you're the
[1:43:17] worst hitter on the team so you're ninth
[1:43:20] and you get into the climax
[1:43:22] of the game
[1:43:25] and your number one hitter comes up and
[1:43:27] you're number two and number three and
[1:43:30] number four and you're you're five you
[1:43:31] know the one that sits in the pocket
[1:43:33] there oh man the anchor there and
[1:43:34] they've drove it in the runs and you've
[1:43:36] got down to two outs
[1:43:37] and now it's game seven of the World
[1:43:40] Series it's bottom of the ninth inning
[1:43:42] there's two outs bases are loaded it's a
[1:43:46] full count and the last guy in the
[1:43:48] lineup everybody's like number nine
[1:43:53] but the great conductor says
[1:43:56] that's the way I drew it up
[1:43:59] that's exactly the way I wanted it
[1:44:03] I actually have been waiting for this
[1:44:07] moment
[1:44:08] for this time for this climax
[1:44:11] for this moment through all time
[1:44:14] I've been building to this very hour and
[1:44:17] this very moment and you feel like the
[1:44:19] least of all of them but you are the one
[1:44:21] God predestinated to put death under
[1:44:25] your feet
[1:44:27] you're the one he predestinated to live
[1:44:30] in their Rapture age you're the one he
[1:44:32] predestinated the live in the bright age
[1:44:34] you're the one he predestinated to catch
[1:44:37] the revelation of the son of man you're
[1:44:39] the one that was predestinated to catch
[1:44:41] Revelations 10 1-7 you are elected and
[1:44:45] you were chosen to be the fruit of this
[1:44:48] age
[1:44:49] Hallelujah
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:55] the last shall be first
[1:44:57] and the first shall be last
[1:45:01] they all played out their part
[1:45:06] but you got to know the sheet music
[1:45:08] all right
[1:45:10] we see the sheet music that they played
[1:45:12] out
[1:45:13] we see what Abel had to do right
[1:45:16] we see what Enoch had to do he had to
[1:45:17] walk with God
[1:45:19] we see Abraham
[1:45:20] we can look down through the scriptures
[1:45:22] right you can you see the sheet music
[1:45:23] can you see the part each one of them
[1:45:25] had to play come on
[1:45:28] Stay With Me
[1:45:30] just a little bit more to go
[1:45:32] hope we're not boring you
[1:45:35] we see the part that they had to play
[1:45:39] but now you know I'll be brother Branham
[1:45:42] um maybe in the unveiling of God or
[1:45:44] Mighty God unveiled before us I believe
[1:45:46] he talks about the the drama of Peter
[1:45:48] and some of the wolf or something like
[1:45:50] that where you got to know the sheet
[1:45:51] music right everybody the conductor
[1:45:53] right everybody's playing their part
[1:45:55] and it's playing out a picture it's
[1:45:57] playing out a great drama and everybody
[1:45:58] got to know their part right win to play
[1:46:00] on the sheet music you got to know the
[1:46:02] sheet music you got to know your part
[1:46:05] that's what the message of the hour has
[1:46:07] come to do is to tell you your part
[1:46:10] to tell you your part and praise God we
[1:46:13] had a rehearsal
[1:46:14] Hallelujah we had a sheath wave come and
[1:46:17] show us our part
[1:46:20] we didn't have to guess what it was he
[1:46:23] showed us what it was he showed us what
[1:46:25] it looks like he showed us what the word
[1:46:28] made flesh for the age looks like and
[1:46:30] acts like and talks like believes like
[1:46:33] speaks like
[1:46:35] well that ain't too fanatical for you
[1:46:38] it's the fruit of the age
[1:46:42] the prophet of God says in the Mighty
[1:46:44] God unveiled before us
[1:46:46] the word of God is lauded to each age
[1:46:49] what it is to be and Jesus was the
[1:46:52] Fulfillment of all the prophecies in him
[1:46:55] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:46:57] it was in him he was the one that was in
[1:47:00] Joseph
[1:47:02] he was the one that was in Elijah
[1:47:05] he was the one that was in Moses
[1:47:09] he was the one that was in
[1:47:13] he was the one that came to Gideon he
[1:47:17] was the all these predestinated ones
[1:47:20] and the time would fail me to tell about
[1:47:22] Barack and Gideon and all these ones and
[1:47:24] all the women that received their dead
[1:47:26] back to life he was the one that was in
[1:47:29] them he is the one that's in you
[1:47:33] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:47:36] that is in the world each one played
[1:47:38] their part
[1:47:40] now I like the story of Gideon
[1:47:43] we'll end right here along along these
[1:47:45] lines
[1:47:47] here come
[1:47:49] Gideon's turn
[1:47:51] to play out his part
[1:47:54] and get in there you know he's thinking
[1:47:56] on the prophet had given his message and
[1:47:58] he's thinking all the Our Father Abraham
[1:48:00] Our Father Isaac and and all of these
[1:48:02] things he's thinking about all the Royal
[1:48:04] Seed of Abraham and he's there thinking
[1:48:06] on the message of the hour and all of a
[1:48:08] sudden there comes an angel that says
[1:48:11] Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:48:17] who me
[1:48:19] I I think you got the wrong guy no
[1:48:23] Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:48:28] a prophet of God would pick that up and
[1:48:29] sound now Gideon thought it was an angel
[1:48:32] but it was the angel of the Lord Capital
[1:48:35] Ale
[1:48:36] o r d
[1:48:39] it wasn't an angel
[1:48:41] it was the angel
[1:48:44] and Gideon who me
[1:48:47] I'm a mighty man of Valor
[1:48:51] Gideon was elected
[1:48:53] he was chosen and the mighty Angel if
[1:48:56] you will the angel of the Lord he came
[1:49:00] to Gideon and said Gideon thou Mighty
[1:49:03] Man of Valor now Gideon didn't feel like
[1:49:06] a Mighty Man
[1:49:09] he didn't look
[1:49:11] like a mighty man he didn't think he was
[1:49:15] a mighty man but the only thing that
[1:49:18] mattered was who said what he was
[1:49:21] the angel of Lords that did in you are a
[1:49:25] mighty man of Valor the angel Lord came
[1:49:28] down and said get in you're a mighty man
[1:49:32] of Aller do you realize what has come
[1:49:34] down according to the opening of The
[1:49:36] Seven Seals the mighty Angel has come
[1:49:39] down and said you are my bride you are
[1:49:43] predestinated you will bring forth the
[1:49:46] word of God you will bring forth the
[1:49:49] fruit of the age it wasn't an angel
[1:49:51] speaking it was the mighty Angel
[1:49:54] speaking
[1:49:58] maybe we'll just call for the musicians
[1:50:00] we'll keep working towards a close I had
[1:50:03] to plug this quote in just before
[1:50:05] service here he says now Gideon when he
[1:50:07] was out there on the thresh in his wheat
[1:50:10] no doubt but the prophet's message was
[1:50:12] going through his heart
[1:50:14] what that Prophet said I'm the god of
[1:50:16] Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:50:19] just be real Reverend now as we come to
[1:50:20] a close
[1:50:22] I am the one that brought you out
[1:50:25] of Egypt
[1:50:26] I am the one that give you what you've
[1:50:29] got turn to me
[1:50:31] and there he and his father out there
[1:50:34] threshing this wheat
[1:50:36] and an angel came to him or he thought
[1:50:39] it was an angel
[1:50:40] it happened to turn out it wasn't an
[1:50:42] angel it was God himself because you got
[1:50:45] to watch that capital
[1:50:46] l-o-r-d-u-c and when he spoke to Gideon
[1:50:50] Gideon was a little surprised he said
[1:50:53] now Mighty Man of Valor he didn't know
[1:50:55] he was
[1:50:57] maybe you don't know you are
[1:51:01] you might be many of those Mighty Men of
[1:51:04] Valor tonight sitting here
[1:51:08] the great conductors come down
[1:51:12] it's time for you to Play Your Part
[1:51:15] you want to know what your part is
[1:51:18] it's an open book
[1:51:22] in plain language the true bride of
[1:51:24] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:51:27] though not expressed until each came
[1:51:29] forth in their designated decreed season
[1:51:32] you want to know why you're here
[1:51:35] and as each member came forth it
[1:51:37] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:51:39] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:51:43] word seed bride
[1:51:46] foreign
[1:51:47] I believe God came down himself
[1:51:51] and spoke his bride into existence
[1:51:55] I believe that with all of my heart
[1:51:59] it's not what I did
[1:52:03] get in
[1:52:05] I think we need some Gideons in here
[1:52:09] they're recognize
[1:52:12] who's talking to them
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:18] play that song in G for me
[1:52:24] that the angel of the Lord has come down
[1:52:29] he's opened the word
[1:52:32] he's revealed the son of perdition
[1:52:34] he's revealing himself
[1:52:37] to you that you can become one
[1:52:41] with him
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:43] you are the word
[1:52:46] you are the light of the world
[1:52:49] a city that sat on a hill can't be hid
[1:52:54] a prophet said there is only one way and
[1:52:56] Christ is that way
[1:52:59] and Christ is the word that lives in you
[1:53:02] that verifies everything
[1:53:05] that he promised in its season
[1:53:09] catch that
[1:53:12] and Christ is the word that lives in you
[1:53:16] that verifies everything
[1:53:19] that he promised in its season
[1:53:22] is is what season are you living in
[1:53:26] not the season of your mind
[1:53:28] not the season of your flesh
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:33] the season of the word
[1:53:39] do you realize what season you're living
[1:53:40] in
[1:53:42] do you realize what's
[1:53:44] being made available to you
[1:53:48] do you realize what we're on the border
[1:53:50] of
[1:53:52] and we allow
[1:53:53] carnal conditions and
[1:53:55] seasons of life and turmoil and trial
[1:53:59] and and all of these things to Rob us
[1:54:01] from recognizing the season of the word
[1:54:03] that we're living in
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:08] but that's what Christ has come to do is
[1:54:10] to call you out of a lady you'll see a
[1:54:12] condition
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:14] to call you into a Rapture season
[1:54:19] we're living in a Rapture season
[1:54:24] Prophet said in a man that gots the
[1:54:25] spirit of God in him or a woman
[1:54:29] lives that word lives it right out in
[1:54:32] them
