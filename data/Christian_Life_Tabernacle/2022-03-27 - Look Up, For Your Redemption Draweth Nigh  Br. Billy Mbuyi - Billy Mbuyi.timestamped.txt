[45:10] stress of nations with perplexity
[45:13] seas and waves roaring
[45:16] says man's heart
[45:18] failing them
[45:20] for fear
[45:22] and for looking after those things which
[45:25] are come are coming upon the earth for
[45:28] the power of the heavens shall be shaken
[45:31] it says
[45:32] and and and then
[45:34] shall they shall they see the son of man
[45:37] coming in a cloud with power
[45:39] and great glory
[45:41] and when these things
[45:43] begin to come to pass
[45:45] then look up and lift up your right your
[45:48] head for your redemption draw it nigh
[45:52] amen i would like to
[45:54] if maybe seated i would like to take my
[45:56] title
[45:57] from this
[45:58] verse that we read and i want to call it
[46:01] look up for your redemption draw at
[46:03] night
[46:04] i mean let's
[46:05] turn to
[46:07] uh roman's very scripture reading very
[46:10] familiar romans chapter 8 verse we're
[46:12] going to start from verse 18
[46:15] it says for i reckon that the suffering
[46:17] of this present time
[46:19] are not worthy to be compared with the
[46:22] glory
[46:23] which shall be revealing us
[46:25] so there's a time where the glory will
[46:27] be revealing us
[46:29] it says that for the earnest expectation
[46:31] of the creature
[46:33] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[46:35] sons of god
[46:37] for the creation was made subject to
[46:40] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[46:44] him who has subjected the same in a hope
[46:47] because the creature itself also shall
[46:50] be
[46:51] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[46:54] into the glorious liberty of the
[46:56] children of god now verbum uses this and
[47:00] he says
[47:02] because the master failed so did this
[47:05] creation
[47:06] so the restoration of the creation was
[47:09] directly tied to the restoration of the
[47:11] master of the creation so once you
[47:14] restore the master creation comes right
[47:16] back
[47:17] there's nothing that needs to be done
[47:19] with the creation except to raise its
[47:21] master back up
[47:22] and it says for now the whole
[47:25] now we know that the whole creation
[47:28] growneth and travail it in in pain
[47:30] together until now and not only
[47:33] they but ourselves also which
[47:36] have the first fruits of the spirit
[47:39] even we
[47:41] ourselves grown
[47:42] with
[47:44] grown
[47:45] grown within ourselves
[47:47] waiting waiting for the adoption to
[47:50] reach the redemption of our body amen
[47:55] like i said i would like to speak for a
[47:57] little bit
[47:58] but before i go on i just want to say
[48:01] i enjoy the word this morning what our
[48:03] brother matthew was bringing up
[48:05] because we i was thinking about the
[48:08] scripture i believe it's in uh ii samuel
[48:11] the 23rd chapter he speaks about david
[48:15] how that you know he woke up one morning
[48:18] and he desired to drink the water from
[48:20] the weld of bethlehem
[48:24] and he
[48:25] he was working and he just
[48:28] within his heart and he just felt like
[48:30] that water could quench his terrorist he
[48:32] said i just feel like
[48:34] drinking and
[48:35] and if you go read it even the way a
[48:38] prophet speaks about it
[48:39] that very say inspired three men
[48:43] to go and i was checking about it before
[48:45] i came to church i believe barbara says
[48:48] it was about 15 miles of philistine
[48:54] just a cup of water
[48:57] you think about inspiration and
[48:59] you think about
[49:01] something that just a man and this is
[49:04] him a type of christ he just desired and
[49:06] said i just decided to drink all the
[49:08] waters of it like he tasted all the
[49:10] other water if you ever wanted something
[49:13] just the way it was just the way
[49:16] something within its heart is if i could
[49:18] just drink off that water
[49:20] and three of his mighty men
[49:22] walked through
[49:23] 15 miles
[49:26] of the philistine
[49:30] i thought about it and i said
[49:32] what about us
[49:35] oh if we could carry his desire like
[49:37] this
[49:38] mighty man of david just hungered within
[49:41] himself they just he didn't say much he
[49:43] didn't say i sent you to go get me water
[49:46] he didn't say just the fact that he
[49:48] desired it it was good enough for him
[49:50] for them
[49:52] i tell you we we have to come to the
[49:54] place where the word is us
[49:56] when he desires it it's our desire when
[49:59] he wants it it's us that want it when he
[50:01] wants it why because we want the master
[50:03] to be pleased we want him to be at peace
[50:06] we want to serve him with all our heart
[50:09] you know
[50:10] really if you look at it the perfection
[50:13] that we talk about is when the master
[50:16] can actually taste of his own work
[50:23] is after the master can actually come
[50:25] and say well i've worked and i've worked
[50:27] through this vineyard and i've done all
[50:29] that i could and i've worked through the
[50:31] ultra i've done all of this let me taste
[50:33] of the wine of it and see how it tastes
[50:36] when the very elements or the things
[50:39] that he's been working at becomes the
[50:41] things that feed him
[50:46] i pray it's not enthusiasm that we
[50:49] desire as alberta said you know
[50:51] enthusiasm will get you all worked up
[50:54] and everything and you go worked up but
[50:56] the moment you get out of here the
[50:58] moment your mind switches to something
[51:00] else
[51:01] your enthusiasm goes away with it
[51:04] but faith is what has long-range vision
[51:07] like our prophet tells us faith is what
[51:10] looks at and doesn't care faith is what
[51:12] has an objective that can look and say
[51:15] this is what i desire no matter what
[51:17] this is what i'm obtained and it doesn't
[51:19] matter how many how many times you get
[51:21] knocked down faith stays with it
[51:25] wha oh let me say this we we want to
[51:28] stay with it we don't want that kind of
[51:30] experience we get it today and then the
[51:32] next time when we show i want something
[51:34] more i want something i could stay with
[51:37] it i stay with it today i stay with it
[51:40] tomorrow i stay with it the next day
[51:43] something that can keep you something i
[51:45] can walk something you can say you i'm
[51:48] not what i used to be i've been changed
[51:50] and that's forever
[51:57] so i want to speak on like i said
[52:00] look up for your redemption draw is nigh
[52:03] and and as we read the scripture
[52:06] here even in luke it says when you see
[52:08] those things it says look up for your
[52:10] redemption draw it not now i want you to
[52:12] realize he's actually detailing the
[52:15] conditions that will be upon the earth
[52:17] and the things that will be happening
[52:19] around
[52:20] in this particular time but i want you
[52:22] to focus on that one scripture he's not
[52:24] saying look around to what's happening
[52:27] in the world look around to what's
[52:29] happening behind you look around to
[52:32] everything that's happening or the
[52:33] turmoil and everything he's saying at
[52:35] that particular time i want you to look
[52:37] up
[52:38] continue to look up continue to look up
[52:41] and your redemption comes by looking up
[52:43] not by looking around not by looking oh
[52:46] you know perhaps this is going to come
[52:48] down perhaps this will change perhaps
[52:50] that will change no he's wanting you to
[52:52] focus on what's going to come up
[52:56] now when we we look at and we speak
[52:59] about redemption
[53:01] and and i want to say this when we speak
[53:03] about redemption we are talking you know
[53:06] this words and if you go through the
[53:08] bible and through the messages use
[53:10] entertain interchangeably
[53:13] you could talk about redemption the same
[53:15] way you could talk about restoration
[53:17] because it basically brings the same
[53:20] outcome it talks about the same thing uh
[53:23] it basically uh goes to do the same
[53:26] thing with a person so when we talk
[53:28] about
[53:29] redemption one of the things that has to
[53:31] come in mind it's important to realize
[53:34] what is it that we are being brought
[53:35] back to
[53:38] it's redemption it's the restoration but
[53:40] what is this restoration about what is
[53:43] it that we are being brought back to and
[53:45] so in that we have to see what is the
[53:48] pre-existing relationship that was
[53:50] before what is it that we can go back
[53:52] and say this is what it was in the
[53:54] beginning this is what it was this is
[53:57] what the relationship was in the
[53:58] beginning therefore as we're saying we
[54:00] are being redeemed this is the part that
[54:03] we have to see come to play and this is
[54:06] the expected result to say that we have
[54:08] been restored to say that restoration
[54:11] has taken place to claim that
[54:13] restoration has taken place there has to
[54:16] be a pre-existing condition that we can
[54:18] look back and reconcile and say that
[54:21] this is what it was before this is what
[54:24] it had become but the restoration has
[54:26] taken it right back into what it was
[54:28] before
[54:31] so in order to understand that we have
[54:33] to go back we have to understand what
[54:36] was the relationship between adam and
[54:39] god
[54:41] what was even we we could even say from
[54:43] the standpoint of the message we have
[54:45] been taken into the existence of what
[54:48] was in the mind of god before the
[54:50] beginning so we can understand it and
[54:52] why because you cannot go and claim
[54:56] something that you didn't know existed
[54:58] you cannot claim a position that never
[55:00] existed you cannot go into those things
[55:03] and trying to find a position that never
[55:05] was there but with the understanding and
[55:08] the revelation of this hour it gives us
[55:11] the ability for us to go back and say
[55:13] this is what i'm looking for this is
[55:15] what i'm trying to be restored to
[55:18] so and i want to say this
[55:21] you you can you can you can only have
[55:24] something if you had been something
[55:27] before
[55:31] when we speak about redemption or
[55:34] restoration you can only be what you
[55:37] were
[55:39] you cannot become something new
[55:42] something can only be
[55:44] restored into something that was before
[55:47] as a matter of fact i could say you
[55:49] cannot be something that you were not
[55:54] that's right
[55:56] and yes the focus because the the this
[55:59] establishes what the relationship is
[56:02] when we say i'm going to be restored i'm
[56:05] going to be brought back
[56:07] in other in essence the question that's
[56:10] being asked is what was i before
[56:13] what am i being restored to what was i
[56:15] before that's what establishes the
[56:18] relationship and i want to say also this
[56:20] the the when you speak about redemption
[56:24] redemption identifies the origin
[56:28] i i don't want you to lose me there
[56:30] redemption identifies the origin
[56:34] you know i was thinking about even this
[56:36] afternoon you know we we have a song
[56:39] in french i heard it many times when i
[56:42] was younger
[56:44] many times and it says that
[56:47] the evening time
[56:49] identifies the origin of everything
[56:52] and i'll give an example
[56:55] you you take for instance kids and they
[56:57] woke up in the morning they go to school
[56:59] or to the play yard or they go places to
[57:02] play and everything
[57:04] uh you when you realize that when the
[57:06] sun starts to go down
[57:08] it's it's the time for everybody to
[57:10] start looking and thinking about home
[57:14] you you look at the animal kingdom you
[57:16] could see the birds and the animals and
[57:18] all those they will go out hunting and
[57:21] looking for seeds and everything they
[57:23] will go and get the seeds but in the
[57:26] evening time every bird has to know
[57:28] where the nest is
[57:30] what is our resting place every lion or
[57:33] every whatever has to know this is the
[57:35] place where we gather in the evening
[57:37] time this is the place where we're
[57:39] supposed to be in the evening time so
[57:41] once the morning comes they go and they
[57:43] go places they may go as far as they
[57:45] want but the evening time is what
[57:48] determines the origin because the
[57:50] evening time causes them to go right
[57:53] back into where they were before the
[57:55] next day start
[57:59] and i want to say this i'm encouraged by
[58:01] this because when we desire the things
[58:04] of god when especially in this evening
[58:06] time you have to understand redemption
[58:08] could not happen in the first half
[58:10] church ages that was just the opening in
[58:13] fact it was the paying of the price it
[58:15] was the sacrificial lamb and the whole
[58:18] thing and and and the work that was
[58:20] being laid out but it wasn't until the
[58:22] evening time that the claiming has to
[58:25] come where everything has to be returned
[58:27] to the original owner everything has to
[58:30] be
[58:31] returned to the original place where
[58:33] everything has to be set right back into
[58:35] what it was in the beginning
[58:38] so i want to say this the church of the
[58:40] living god that started at pentecost and
[58:43] he came in and he came and he traveled
[58:45] through the whole thing and we find out
[58:48] that in the evening time the prophet is
[58:50] coming back is pointing it right back
[58:52] into its origin
[58:54] he's not coming back and writing
[58:56] pointing it and say well we are here
[58:59] we've gone to sanctification
[59:00] justification this is our identification
[59:03] but no the identification at the end
[59:05] time is the origin of where it comes
[59:08] from
[59:09] oh that's why i began to think you know
[59:12] you look at this world and you look at
[59:14] the things that's happening that's why
[59:16] it's important as we read the bible it
[59:18] says that in this end time this is
[59:20] what's going to happen even as we read
[59:22] in luke 21 this is the condition upon
[59:25] this and this is the condition upon that
[59:27] let me say this the world has identified
[59:30] itself in the scripture and they find
[59:33] themselves in the spirit of it but one
[59:35] of them says that god didn't destroy the
[59:38] earth all it took was for the prophecy
[59:41] to come forth and man finds himself in
[59:44] the condition of the prophecy of the end
[59:46] time but it says that man destroys the
[59:49] earth
[59:51] why because they've entered into the
[59:53] spirit of the end time they've entered
[59:56] into the condition of the end time they
[59:58] have identified themselves to be part of
[1:00:01] that particular
[1:00:03] origin they they know that they didn't
[1:00:05] come from god they they didn't come in
[1:00:07] fact they claimed themselves to be
[1:00:09] coming from an evolution and that's what
[1:00:12] evolution because there's no life in it
[1:00:14] where therefore the end of it is death
[1:00:16] so the only thing that goes right back
[1:00:19] into god is whatever came out of god
[1:00:25] so the end that's why we when we talk
[1:00:28] about the book of genesis the prophet
[1:00:30] tells us it's the c chapter it's a very
[1:00:33] important book because it shows you
[1:00:36] exactly where everything came from it
[1:00:38] shows you how the devil started his work
[1:00:41] it shows you how god started his work
[1:00:43] and he shows you how those two seed
[1:00:45] travel through time and he shows you how
[1:00:48] they continually begin to manifest how
[1:00:51] that the seed of the enemy continually
[1:00:53] tries to kill the seed of god it
[1:00:55] continually continually tries until the
[1:00:58] very end therefore when we look in the
[1:01:00] book of revelation we see those two
[1:01:02] seeds and we see what the outcome of
[1:01:04] them is going to be
[1:01:09] so we could see here we say the prophecy
[1:01:13] of the end time the world is entered
[1:01:15] into the spirit of the last day and god
[1:01:18] is not going to destroy man but man is
[1:01:21] going to destroy himself
[1:01:24] and they've entered into the spirit of
[1:01:26] the last day and they can't help it
[1:01:32] why
[1:01:33] because they have no identification in
[1:01:35] god
[1:01:37] because they cannot find themselves who
[1:01:40] they are in god therefore they cannot be
[1:01:43] restored
[1:01:46] but we find out at the same time that
[1:01:48] there's a bride who's entered into the
[1:01:50] spirit of the prophecy that was written
[1:01:52] about her how that she was going to do
[1:01:55] the greater works how that she's going
[1:01:56] to come and be the manifestation of the
[1:01:59] written word and in entering into that
[1:02:02] spirit there is also another
[1:02:04] manifestation not by those people but by
[1:02:07] god doing it through them that they can
[1:02:09] manifest the very word that was promised
[1:02:12] of them
[1:02:18] but one of them speaks and this is in a
[1:02:20] message
[1:02:21] revelation is speaking revelation
[1:02:23] chapter 5 and he says now notice
[1:02:26] it was the lamb it was the lamb redeemer
[1:02:30] a lamb redeemer just like the first
[1:02:33] god never changes it says that god never
[1:02:36] changed amen it says the first redeemer
[1:02:39] was a lamb in the garden of eden it was
[1:02:42] a lamb that was offered so he speaks
[1:02:44] about the skin that god took after adam
[1:02:47] and eve uh sinned
[1:02:50] god was the first one to come in and
[1:02:52] take an animal and kill it and take off
[1:02:54] the of the the skin of it and dress them
[1:02:57] up well what was it it was an
[1:02:59] identification of what was to come so
[1:03:02] he's saying it was a lamb that was
[1:03:03] offered and it says in the erie again
[1:03:06] here again plummet over in the
[1:03:08] revelation it's again the lamb redeeming
[1:03:12] what the fallen condition
[1:03:14] the the fallen condition and the fallen
[1:03:17] inheritance of the fallen race of people
[1:03:21] a lamb comes back to redeem like like
[1:03:25] ours
[1:03:26] was in the beginning to redeem us
[1:03:30] listen now he asked to redeem what
[1:03:34] he says what he's going to redeem what
[1:03:37] is it what is he going to redeem us
[1:03:39] about he says to bring us anything
[1:03:42] that's redeemed is something that's been
[1:03:45] lost
[1:03:48] now he's saying this purposely so we
[1:03:51] understand there's the existing of
[1:03:53] something there's the losing of
[1:03:55] something and then there's a redemption
[1:03:58] so he's wanting to break it apart so we
[1:04:00] know if you never was lost there's no
[1:04:02] need for redemption
[1:04:05] if it was never lost there's no need for
[1:04:07] redemption so redemption is for
[1:04:09] something that was lost so because it's
[1:04:12] lost because it moved it was moved from
[1:04:15] its original position it's moved from
[1:04:18] a condition that it was into the
[1:04:20] beginning and it's moved into another
[1:04:22] condition
[1:04:23] it says it's something that's been lost
[1:04:26] and then it's been brought back again
[1:04:28] what does he bring us back to what does
[1:04:31] he bring back to us this lamp it says
[1:04:34] everything we had in the beginning
[1:04:38] now i don't know about you i want to
[1:04:40] know what is everything we had in the
[1:04:42] beginning
[1:04:46] we i i just i want to shout but i'm
[1:04:49] trying to just keep my energy i'm not
[1:04:51] 100 so i don't want to stop halfway so
[1:04:55] i'm just going to try to get to the end
[1:04:57] but but but we we have to understand
[1:05:00] what kind of believers are we
[1:05:02] that we we've been called into something
[1:05:04] and and we've been given an inheritance
[1:05:07] it behooves us to know what this
[1:05:09] inheritance was what is it everything
[1:05:12] what is everything means what is it
[1:05:14] that's mine oh i tell you when when
[1:05:17] something has been given to you it's
[1:05:19] important you you define what it is it's
[1:05:22] it's important you know the boundaries
[1:05:24] of it god told abraham i'll give you the
[1:05:27] earth
[1:05:30] and i want to say this the earth is
[1:05:32] yours
[1:05:33] he says the the however far you can see
[1:05:37] however wide you can see wherever your
[1:05:40] foot steps on it says it belongs to you
[1:05:43] it gave you all the earth he gives you
[1:05:45] all the stars it says all of this is
[1:05:47] yours
[1:05:48] and then so now the prophet is telling
[1:05:50] us is everything that we had in the
[1:05:53] beginning now let me continue on what is
[1:05:56] it it says what did we have at the
[1:05:59] beginning
[1:06:00] oh i love this
[1:06:02] he says eternal life
[1:06:05] we was heir of the world
[1:06:08] this world belonged to us
[1:06:11] god didn't create the earth for himself
[1:06:14] he created the earth for you
[1:06:16] he gifted up to adam he created adam to
[1:06:20] be his reflection on earth so he can be
[1:06:23] the god of all the universe but adam was
[1:06:26] the one the earth was given to the title
[1:06:30] deed that was made had adam's name on it
[1:06:33] and nobody else
[1:06:35] not even god had his name on it when he
[1:06:38] made it he wrote it for adam and he gave
[1:06:41] it to him that's why when it was lost it
[1:06:44] went back to the original owner and the
[1:06:46] original owner never needed it in the
[1:06:48] first place and ever since he's been
[1:06:50] working to try to give it back to the
[1:06:53] son that he promised he was going to
[1:06:55] give it to
[1:07:00] and and
[1:07:01] everything what is everything
[1:07:04] the earth
[1:07:05] eternal life
[1:07:06] we had he says we had life
[1:07:10] oh my
[1:07:11] i tell you this is not life if you think
[1:07:14] this is life you are mistaken this is
[1:07:17] death and we perspire we die we get sick
[1:07:21] today and well tomorrow and we eat and
[1:07:24] we constantly eat and we have to eat to
[1:07:26] keep this body going and we get weak and
[1:07:29] we get tired and we get dead i don't
[1:07:32] want this life
[1:07:34] you can take this life as much as i'm
[1:07:37] concerned what i desire is to have that
[1:07:40] life because i know if i have life that
[1:07:42] life you can take this life but i will
[1:07:44] never die
[1:07:49] he says
[1:07:51] he says we had life
[1:07:54] we never had to die
[1:07:57] we never have to be sick
[1:07:59] we never had to get old
[1:08:02] we never had any worries
[1:08:04] he says where there was no funerals no
[1:08:08] grave
[1:08:09] no evil no death no grave
[1:08:12] no gray hair
[1:08:13] no stooped up shoulder no mourning no
[1:08:17] crying we have we had life and i say
[1:08:21] give me that kind of life
[1:08:26] and it says eternal life we had just we
[1:08:29] we we had the the jurisdiction over the
[1:08:33] earth we was we was god he says
[1:08:37] uh minister of god he said on the earth
[1:08:40] walked about and if they if the tree
[1:08:44] didn't look right standing there we said
[1:08:47] be thou plucked up and set over here
[1:08:50] and it would be and it will do the winds
[1:08:53] was blowing we didn't want the winds to
[1:08:55] blow
[1:08:56] peace be still and he did it
[1:09:02] what are we being restored to what is
[1:09:05] this redemption about what is it that we
[1:09:07] desire let me say my brother my sister
[1:09:10] let's not be mistaken god didn't save us
[1:09:13] so we could just sit here and say praise
[1:09:15] god i'm saved i have the holy ghost and
[1:09:18] and i'm gonna go to heaven and
[1:09:20] everything and i say if that's all you
[1:09:22] desire you're nearsighted
[1:09:24] let me just help you a little bit even
[1:09:26] as a math what matthew said let's just
[1:09:29] there's more into the kingdom of god
[1:09:31] than just not me me not being sick and
[1:09:34] immoral or
[1:09:35] having my next meal and
[1:09:38] as a matter of fact he's trying to let
[1:09:40] you know that you don't even have to go
[1:09:42] through all of that because all of this
[1:09:44] belong to you
[1:09:49] imagine a man who owns the the cattle
[1:09:53] and who homes the the the the the houses
[1:09:56] and everything and he comes in and and
[1:09:58] he's acting like a beggar oh you know
[1:10:00] can i have ten dollars they'll look at
[1:10:02] him you are full all of this belong to
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:11] he says
[1:10:13] he says
[1:10:15] which says blow it says to redeem us it
[1:10:19] says to redeem all that back to us again
[1:10:23] he says oh oh oh my get all that back
[1:10:27] again he continues on and he says and
[1:10:30] now nature itself is groaning waiting to
[1:10:34] what to the what to the manifestation of
[1:10:36] sons of god the sons of god to be
[1:10:39] manifested and we have the earnest of
[1:10:42] our salvation now now look at what he's
[1:10:45] pointing to now he's speaking about the
[1:10:47] holy ghost that we have been given so
[1:10:49] the earnest is something to show you
[1:10:52] that there's more to come
[1:10:53] the earnest is the down payment it's not
[1:10:56] the full payment it's the down payment
[1:10:59] to show you look at what you have today
[1:11:02] what it can do but how much more when
[1:11:04] you have the fullness of it how much
[1:11:06] more can you do so when you receive the
[1:11:09] earnest a person who receives the
[1:11:11] earnest there is a need or desire for
[1:11:14] him to receive the full payment
[1:11:18] the earnest requires or shows that
[1:11:22] there's a full payment coming the
[1:11:24] earnest
[1:11:26] it's an appetite the earnest is
[1:11:29] something that puts you under
[1:11:30] expectation for you to know that there's
[1:11:33] more coming
[1:11:35] but now
[1:11:36] if you're not careful people become
[1:11:38] content with the earnest well you know i
[1:11:40] don't care have you ever been you've
[1:11:42] been you know somebody owes you a
[1:11:44] million dollars and they give you ten
[1:11:46] dollars you're like you know you know
[1:11:48] i'll just content with the ten dollars
[1:11:49] now you know i don't have to worry about
[1:11:51] no he's saying no no no don't have that
[1:11:54] attitude the earnest we have believed
[1:11:56] and listen to what he says the earnest
[1:11:58] of our salvation now
[1:12:00] it says and can take our brother that's
[1:12:02] dying with cancer listen to this the
[1:12:04] earnest itself can take our brother
[1:12:06] that's dying with cancer and stand him
[1:12:09] up a little breath of redemption and
[1:12:12] pray
[1:12:13] and pray and prayer of faith over him
[1:12:16] will turn the shadow of a man back to
[1:12:18] health again
[1:12:20] a man again what will what will we do
[1:12:23] with our full possession
[1:12:28] the earnest is not given for you to be
[1:12:31] satisfied and walk away the earnest is
[1:12:33] given for you to know there's more
[1:12:35] coming is given for you to say i have
[1:12:38] received my earnest i have received the
[1:12:41] taste of it and i want more
[1:12:45] let me say this we cannot be restored
[1:12:48] back to our full position unless we can
[1:12:51] know what is it that we are being
[1:12:52] restored to unless we desire to be
[1:12:55] restored to unless we seek to know what
[1:12:58] is it that we are being restored into
[1:13:04] i have received the earnest what is this
[1:13:07] earnest tell me i don't like this life i
[1:13:10] don't like the the things of the world i
[1:13:13] don't like this the earnest tells me i'm
[1:13:16] gonna be put into possession
[1:13:18] where i'm gonna be overcoming my life
[1:13:21] i'm gonna have overcoming power over sin
[1:13:24] i'm gonna have overcoming power over the
[1:13:27] devil that i am going to be speaking
[1:13:29] god's word and it's going to come to
[1:13:31] pass
[1:13:33] the earnest is telling you look at adam
[1:13:36] when he didn't like the way that the
[1:13:38] wings blow he could say wind stop when
[1:13:41] he didn't like the places that placing
[1:13:43] off a mountain he could tell the
[1:13:45] mountain move down here and go over here
[1:13:48] and i want to say this we are in the
[1:13:50] perfect condition for this thing to come
[1:13:53] to pass why because god has pledged you
[1:13:56] here and no doubt every one of us
[1:13:58] sitting here you have mountains and you
[1:14:00] have things and you have situations and
[1:14:03] everything the earnest is speaking to
[1:14:05] you at this moment and telling you that
[1:14:08] you can change those things
[1:14:14] the earnest is not there saying be
[1:14:17] content
[1:14:18] just walk keep your head down the anus
[1:14:21] is saying you were built for more than
[1:14:23] death you were built to be a son and the
[1:14:26] daughter of god you are given possession
[1:14:29] over the earth and as a matter of fact
[1:14:31] those people that are telling you what
[1:14:33] to do they are the ones working for you
[1:14:40] we got the position twisted oh what is
[1:14:43] my boss gonna say and we tremble
[1:14:49] are you adam's race
[1:14:53] are you
[1:14:54] the king the the seed of abraham
[1:14:59] who are you
[1:15:01] when we say we need to know who we are i
[1:15:03] wonder how many times that goes over our
[1:15:06] head because we think what we are or who
[1:15:08] we are we think about oh you know this
[1:15:11] great power of standing and everybody
[1:15:13] looking at you and saying i want this
[1:15:16] and in the whole earth tenders no it's
[1:15:18] in simplicity that god reveals himself
[1:15:21] it's you coming into a position where
[1:15:24] you understand what god's desire is you
[1:15:26] understand what he wants you to do with
[1:15:28] the word and you're saying that this
[1:15:31] circumstance should not be and therefore
[1:15:33] i speak the word issue change
[1:15:39] and in order to get into that situation
[1:15:41] we need to be obedient to the word that
[1:15:44] brings us into that situation
[1:15:50] now he continues on and he says
[1:15:53] nature knows
[1:15:55] that
[1:15:56] it says nature nature knows
[1:15:59] that nature is groaning
[1:16:01] and we are groaning with it
[1:16:04] nature is waiting for the manifestation
[1:16:06] of sons of god because nature
[1:16:09] because nature was cursed with his
[1:16:11] master
[1:16:13] when its master was cursed the highest
[1:16:16] then nature fall with a master
[1:16:19] but it says but when the when this
[1:16:21] kingsman redeemer comes hallelujah and
[1:16:24] redeems us back
[1:16:27] and redeems the man back
[1:16:29] the master the master over nature then
[1:16:32] all nature is waiting for the man the
[1:16:35] master it says it says what do we do
[1:16:39] he says we take the axe and slip it and
[1:16:42] slip it in our hands and chop the tree
[1:16:45] down if we want if we want to but
[1:16:48] but it says but that day won't be one
[1:16:52] but but that day we won't do that
[1:16:55] all nature is waiting for his master and
[1:16:58] the master is the son of god and was
[1:17:00] given this earth now god
[1:17:04] god will have his heaven of course
[1:17:07] but this was given to man and the
[1:17:10] kingsman redeemer come to redeem us back
[1:17:13] to what we lost what a beaut what
[1:17:15] beautiful how beautiful i think it says
[1:17:18] a lamb redeemer when the work is
[1:17:21] finished we have all kinds we have all
[1:17:25] things again what kind of things we have
[1:17:28] all power we have all eternal life we
[1:17:31] have all eternal health we have all
[1:17:34] eternal youth we have all eternal power
[1:17:37] we have just
[1:17:40] we are just eternal as
[1:17:43] as with the eternal then we are waiting
[1:17:46] for what
[1:17:48] we are waiting for what time to come
[1:17:50] waiting and groaning so there he is in
[1:17:53] the same what is it and i thought that
[1:17:55] was such a a marvelous uh understanding
[1:17:59] of what is it that we are being moved
[1:18:01] into we we're not being moved to where
[1:18:04] we just say praise god i'm safe from sin
[1:18:07] into
[1:18:08] i'm safe from sin i move from the
[1:18:10] kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
[1:18:12] light praise god i'm no longer a sinner
[1:18:15] that's why i'm saying this redemption
[1:18:18] the first part of redemption was to pay
[1:18:20] the price but the part the second part
[1:18:22] of this redemption is for the full price
[1:18:25] that was paid that the claiming work may
[1:18:28] come to pass and if you think about the
[1:18:30] claiming work the book that it takes you
[1:18:32] to is the book of joshua where you can
[1:18:34] understand that here they are they
[1:18:36] walked into the promised land and it was
[1:18:39] upon them to go in and know what is it
[1:18:42] that's in this land of possession that
[1:18:44] belonged to me
[1:18:49] and i want to say this it's not to wait
[1:18:52] until we get to heaven then find out
[1:18:54] what is my inheritance because most of
[1:18:57] us think oh i'm going to claim
[1:18:59] everything then when i get on the other
[1:19:01] side that's not what the scripture says
[1:19:03] the scripture is telling us that in this
[1:19:05] earthly tabernacle we will overcome the
[1:19:08] sin we will put our head over the devil
[1:19:11] we will walk over deadly things that
[1:19:13] will manifest the works of god in this
[1:19:16] body not in the new body but in this
[1:19:19] body and therefore we have to come to
[1:19:21] the place where those are the things
[1:19:23] that we are seeking
[1:19:28] because the understanding is i am not
[1:19:30] here to project darkness i've not been
[1:19:33] sent here to be an instrument to
[1:19:35] darkness but i'm here to project light
[1:19:38] and the kingdom of god i'm here to
[1:19:40] project the kingdom of my father i'm
[1:19:42] here to take possession to what been
[1:19:45] rightly given to me
[1:19:51] but when it talks about
[1:19:54] something being in a pawn shop
[1:19:59] listen to this
[1:20:01] it says
[1:20:02] now if christ was standing here
[1:20:07] the lord jesus in a corporal body like
[1:20:10] mine
[1:20:11] i love when he does this
[1:20:14] because you know exactly where he's
[1:20:16] leading you
[1:20:20] he says wearing
[1:20:22] the suit here
[1:20:25] i want to ask you now
[1:20:28] be careful now how you
[1:20:30] answer if christ was standing here in a
[1:20:34] corporate like mine
[1:20:36] and this woman needed healing
[1:20:38] she comes
[1:20:40] she comes to him she comes to him and he
[1:20:43] said lord will you heal me
[1:20:46] now be careful
[1:20:48] could he do it
[1:20:50] he says
[1:20:51] he was he has already done it is that
[1:20:55] right how many knows that he's healing
[1:20:58] is a finished work
[1:21:00] now oh i want us to just soar above the
[1:21:04] things of the world and come into the
[1:21:05] realization of what's really happening
[1:21:08] here he is now he's demonstrating before
[1:21:11] us what the plan of all redemption is
[1:21:14] all about the plan of redemption is
[1:21:16] about something that was lost and now
[1:21:18] it's been redeemed but yet man has not
[1:21:21] taken possession of it and now he's here
[1:21:24] in the second time in the first time he
[1:21:27] was here to pay for the work that's why
[1:21:29] the prophet could say if he was here
[1:21:31] standing here after he already paid the
[1:21:33] price now he's saying here if he was
[1:21:36] standing here he could not pay the price
[1:21:38] because the price was already paid
[1:21:44] it wouldn't help for him to go back and
[1:21:46] say oh sister dear i'll pay for the
[1:21:49] price again why because the price was
[1:21:51] paid now we're saying you need to move
[1:21:54] from here into another dimension into
[1:21:57] another position where you understand
[1:21:59] that the price has been paid and now i'm
[1:22:02] only here to receive what's rightfully
[1:22:04] mine
[1:22:07] we're not gathered here as beggars those
[1:22:09] that will come and crawl on our knees
[1:22:11] and say god please and god please please
[1:22:13] do this please do this no that's not the
[1:22:16] kind of relationship he's establishing
[1:22:18] in the end time he's called you bride
[1:22:20] for a reason he's called you sons and
[1:22:22] daughters for a reason he's called you
[1:22:24] those things so you can approach him as
[1:22:26] such
[1:22:33] now imagine your wife approaching you as
[1:22:35] a servant
[1:22:38] you will look and find out what's going
[1:22:40] on
[1:22:41] what am i missing here what have i done
[1:22:44] wrong does she not understand her
[1:22:46] position does she not understand what
[1:22:48] she is there to does she not understand
[1:22:51] what belongs to her does she not
[1:22:53] understand the position that she's been
[1:22:55] called to oh she ended with boldness why
[1:22:58] because she understand that i have been
[1:23:00] chosen i am part of this redemption work
[1:23:04] and let me say this redemption doesn't
[1:23:06] stop just that jesus christ it's the
[1:23:08] continuation word that he does even in
[1:23:11] his bride
[1:23:14] it's not a new work it's the same work
[1:23:16] continued
[1:23:19] he says
[1:23:36] now he says be careful he says it was
[1:23:38] the finished work it says then
[1:23:40] if
[1:23:41] it says
[1:23:42] if you had something in the pawnshop
[1:23:45] and you went and redeemed it
[1:23:48] he says could it be redeemed again
[1:23:51] he says
[1:23:52] it's already out of the pawnshop
[1:23:56] you just have to recognize it
[1:24:00] is that right
[1:24:01] it says that's the way his salvation
[1:24:05] salvation is the same way
[1:24:08] it says he was wounded for our
[1:24:10] transgression with the stripes we are
[1:24:12] healed is that right then what we what
[1:24:15] would christ do
[1:24:17] if it was if if it's the same yesterday
[1:24:20] today and forever if he would say it's
[1:24:23] so he he says i've already healed you
[1:24:26] when i died for you
[1:24:31] he's now telling her
[1:24:33] he's now telling them
[1:24:35] what christ would tell them today
[1:24:38] if he was standing here in their midst
[1:24:41] he's now telling them
[1:24:43] that he's not going to go and say well
[1:24:45] it looks like my work was not good
[1:24:47] enough let me go see and see if he could
[1:24:49] work up a little more no he will tell
[1:24:52] them i've already done it
[1:24:55] he says but now
[1:24:57] what could he do he could tell you what
[1:24:59] the father would tell you about her he
[1:25:02] says is that right it says he will do
[1:25:05] the same thing tonight like he did then
[1:25:08] then he's the same is that right now let
[1:25:11] us pray it says the next paragraph
[1:25:14] now in now this is a different message
[1:25:16] identification it says look to show that
[1:25:19] he's the one who brought who
[1:25:22] to show that is the one that he taught
[1:25:25] he starts he's the christian today he's
[1:25:28] taught before the foundation of the
[1:25:30] world he says now remember
[1:25:34] man when he was born in sin trumpet
[1:25:36] iniquity came into the world speaking
[1:25:38] light is that right the congregation say
[1:25:40] amen there is nothing in him at all
[1:25:44] so you see
[1:25:46] if you was in god's thoughts when he
[1:25:48] when he came into the world
[1:25:52] he's come he says
[1:25:55] in god's thought at the beginning to
[1:25:58] display his attribute do you follow me
[1:26:00] then he says then jesus came to break
[1:26:04] the cloud back
[1:26:06] so that attribute could display itself
[1:26:14] if you were a thought in the in god's
[1:26:17] mind
[1:26:17] you were an attribute in him
[1:26:20] and all that jesus has come to do
[1:26:23] is to break the cloud of sin that came
[1:26:26] upon you so you can display that
[1:26:28] attribute that already existed
[1:26:31] now he says is god's expressed word
[1:26:35] now nothing else could be manifesting
[1:26:38] other character had fallen then see
[1:26:42] where did jesus come to bring back those
[1:26:45] character no they were born in sin
[1:26:48] shaped in iniquity he came as a redeemer
[1:26:52] and to redeem anything is to bring it
[1:26:54] back amen it says bring it back it says
[1:26:57] bring it back in god's thought you think
[1:27:00] it says
[1:27:01] you
[1:27:02] think about what he says now think
[1:27:04] you it says little you little me
[1:27:09] no one in the world could take my place
[1:27:14] nobody can take your place
[1:27:20] you being a christian and filled with
[1:27:23] the spirit of god and before the
[1:27:25] foundation of the world see
[1:27:28] you and he knowed you every feature that
[1:27:31] you got see jesus came to bring you back
[1:27:35] that's what jesus was here for
[1:27:38] redeem a human body to bring you back
[1:27:42] that's what he's come to do
[1:27:44] that's what he's come to do the human as
[1:27:46] a redeemer to display his attribute as a
[1:27:49] savior to come he says to
[1:27:52] come to redeem you and bring you back
[1:27:55] where you were from
[1:27:57] where you were from
[1:27:58] where you were from he says
[1:28:02] now let me say this again
[1:28:05] we we
[1:28:06] it's it's important
[1:28:09] as we read
[1:28:16] as we read
[1:28:19] about the relationship of adam and eve
[1:28:22] or the relationship rather between god
[1:28:25] and abraham
[1:28:28] because
[1:28:29] to us it's the revelation
[1:28:32] of what we are being restored into
[1:28:35] amen when we read
[1:28:38] that revelation of what adam and eve
[1:28:41] relate at god and adam because remember
[1:28:45] when we when you go read it it talks
[1:28:47] about adam the god of the earth he said
[1:28:49] he created adam in his image in the
[1:28:51] image even as we read this morning it
[1:28:53] came and he breathed upon him the the
[1:28:55] breath of life the life that was in adam
[1:28:58] came from god and he talks about created
[1:29:00] in the image he was created both male
[1:29:02] and female and he came in and god puts
[1:29:06] him to sleep so that out of
[1:29:08] adam he can bring the mystery which was
[1:29:11] eve while adam was sleeping
[1:29:14] typifying when christ was dead that eve
[1:29:17] was gonna that the second eve was gonna
[1:29:19] come out of adam when adam was asleep
[1:29:22] and there he comes and he shows those
[1:29:23] things now that relationship becomes
[1:29:26] very important because it's a
[1:29:28] description of what relationship we are
[1:29:30] being entered into
[1:29:34] if we if we fail to understand that
[1:29:36] relationship then we fail to understand
[1:29:38] what is it that belongs to us and i want
[1:29:41] to say this part of that relationship or
[1:29:43] the redemption is for us to come back
[1:29:46] and say that whatever is needed within
[1:29:49] the relationship that we have now and
[1:29:51] god that we want to improve it into that
[1:29:54] relationship amen
[1:29:57] that's right
[1:29:59] you know we come here
[1:30:02] and like i said we we have natural
[1:30:04] desires god didn't place us here so we
[1:30:08] can
[1:30:09] play just the role of his servant to
[1:30:12] where you know god we need this and god
[1:30:14] we need that now he is wanting in the
[1:30:17] same time to display something that's
[1:30:20] never even been displayed since the
[1:30:22] beginning he's coming to the place where
[1:30:25] his very fullness is being manifested
[1:30:27] into a people for them to come to a
[1:30:30] place where they understand that they
[1:30:32] are instruments of redemption not just
[1:30:35] the individuals that are placed here
[1:30:37] that can track the origin back to their
[1:30:39] parents and their grandparents and and
[1:30:42] what country they are from and what
[1:30:44] parents under you know we take we we we
[1:30:47] like those things to know i'm from here
[1:30:49] i like this and this is everything about
[1:30:51] me and all of that but god wants us to
[1:30:53] be elevated from those things and come
[1:30:55] into the relationship where you
[1:30:57] understand i'm here more than my natural
[1:31:00] birth more more than my natural origin i
[1:31:03] need to be able to track my origin back
[1:31:05] into god and be able to know what is it
[1:31:08] that i'm explaining or what is it that
[1:31:10] i'm displaying in the same time
[1:31:17] and and i want to say this too because
[1:31:19] the the existing of that relationship
[1:31:23] where where we were
[1:31:24] what we were thinking before and and he
[1:31:27] could where he can come and and and adam
[1:31:30] could come in and and and we can see him
[1:31:33] come and and and subdue over the
[1:31:36] creation and speak over those things and
[1:31:39] everything it's a type of us overcoming
[1:31:42] the things of the world it's a type of
[1:31:44] us using the word of god to subdue the
[1:31:47] things around us
[1:31:53] and and i want to say this it doesn't
[1:31:55] mean we'll not say it to the creation
[1:31:58] but it's a further extension of that
[1:32:01] little because remember here's the thing
[1:32:04] you know the scripture says who ye that
[1:32:06] are faithfully little will be faithful
[1:32:07] in much the the the scripture god wants
[1:32:10] to walk with us you know we don't we are
[1:32:13] not born as mature christians we are not
[1:32:16] born as mature christians from day one
[1:32:18] we start as a baby step to where we
[1:32:21] learn to overcome the things in our
[1:32:23] lives we learn to overcome by the power
[1:32:25] that he has given us we learn to
[1:32:27] overcome by the holy spirit until a
[1:32:30] position has been given unto us where we
[1:32:32] can do what he desires us to do
[1:32:36] but each with an understanding that i
[1:32:38] have a role to play
[1:32:41] in this work of redemption you have a
[1:32:43] part to play and and i want to say this
[1:32:46] like he said it doesn't matter how
[1:32:48] little how big you are it's for
[1:32:50] everybody
[1:32:53] now let me skip this and read this
[1:32:55] because i thought this really blessed my
[1:32:57] heart you know and it says this this is
[1:33:00] the prophet speaking in the message why
[1:33:01] christ speaks
[1:33:03] now i want you to just capture the very
[1:33:05] language of how
[1:33:07] he's saying this and and
[1:33:09] even the very vocabulary of how he's
[1:33:12] saying it he says many times when we
[1:33:14] look at the scripture in our own way we
[1:33:17] look at it and it seems very hard
[1:33:21] he says
[1:33:22] but if we study it a little while
[1:33:25] we find out that the old wise god knows
[1:33:27] just exactly what he's doing
[1:33:30] he says and he knows how to do these
[1:33:33] things and how to deal with man
[1:33:37] and then he says he knows what's in man
[1:33:42] follow me
[1:33:43] and he
[1:33:44] he knows him
[1:33:46] he says and we don't
[1:33:48] we only know
[1:33:51] we know we only know from the
[1:33:52] intellectual side he knows what's really
[1:33:57] in the man
[1:33:59] we know from the intellectual side he
[1:34:02] knows what's really in man now listen to
[1:34:05] this it says moses was born in the world
[1:34:09] and a gifted boy
[1:34:11] he was born to be a prophet a deliverer
[1:34:15] he was born with the equipment
[1:34:18] but it was born equipped born in him as
[1:34:22] every man is as he was born with
[1:34:25] equipment born in him as every man that
[1:34:29] comes into the world is born with this
[1:34:32] equipment
[1:34:35] and then it says and i have as and and
[1:34:38] and as i firmly believe in the full
[1:34:41] knowledge of god and the predestination
[1:34:44] now think about this moses didn't do
[1:34:46] what he did by accident
[1:34:49] the prophet is trying to clearly even as
[1:34:51] we talk about this redemption this
[1:34:54] redemption didn't come by christ just
[1:34:56] deciding i'll die for the sin of the
[1:34:58] world i'll die for the whole world so
[1:35:00] they can love me so they can appreciate
[1:35:02] me and all those things no in the
[1:35:04] purpose of redemption when he comes and
[1:35:06] is dying he knows exactly who he's dying
[1:35:09] for who's he dying for he's dying for
[1:35:12] the people that have that have been
[1:35:14] equipped
[1:35:17] he's not dying for the whole world he's
[1:35:19] dying for those that have been equipped
[1:35:21] and he says we don't know man but god
[1:35:24] knows what he's doing and therefore he
[1:35:26] says he has this equipment within him
[1:35:29] and therefore i say and then he says
[1:35:31] every man that is born he says so is
[1:35:34] every man that comes into the world
[1:35:36] where is with us equipment what
[1:35:39] equipment god placed within you his
[1:35:42] equipment so you can perform his job
[1:35:48] oh i tell you i began to think about the
[1:35:51] woman at the well when jesus met a woman
[1:35:53] at a well look at all the reputation was
[1:35:56] around that she was a prostitute and she
[1:35:58] was this and she was dead but yet when
[1:36:01] jesus came he never mentioned anything
[1:36:03] about that and in fact the scripture
[1:36:05] says i have need to go to samaria what
[1:36:08] was happening the equipment was calling
[1:36:13] it was time to go meet the equipment and
[1:36:16] put it in motion when he came and he met
[1:36:18] a woman who was caught in adultery they
[1:36:21] came and after they all desperate jesus
[1:36:23] looked at her and said where are they
[1:36:25] accuse her he never called her any names
[1:36:27] he just asked where are the accuser and
[1:36:29] she speaks about he says there's none
[1:36:31] left but you it says neither do i
[1:36:33] condemn you why because he came
[1:36:36] following the equipment that was within
[1:36:38] the man therefore you have to understand
[1:36:41] today that as you are you are born with
[1:36:44] an equipment
[1:36:47] you can call it whatever you want just
[1:36:49] know that i believe this message i
[1:36:51] believe this word because i have been
[1:36:54] equipped to believe it
[1:36:56] i have been equipped to follow it i have
[1:36:59] been equipped to listen to it and not
[1:37:02] just to listen to it to follow it but i
[1:37:04] have been equipped so that this
[1:37:06] equipment will put me into motion to
[1:37:10] manifest the works of god
[1:37:15] the works of god cannot be done without
[1:37:17] the equipment
[1:37:20] the works of god what can never be
[1:37:22] performed without his equipment
[1:37:24] oh he says one place he says isn't god
[1:37:27] marvelous here he is
[1:37:30] you are chuckle bed and detects the baby
[1:37:32] and it says
[1:37:34] i believe it's in the message
[1:37:36] uh if i'm not mistaken i'll probably
[1:37:38] just
[1:37:39] uh say it now i i probably won't get
[1:37:42] back to it let me just say now i believe
[1:37:45] he preaches a series of message uh the
[1:37:48] power of god
[1:37:50] the the the the power of god the power
[1:37:53] of decision and the power
[1:37:56] uh uh redemption by power redemption by
[1:38:00] blood and redemption in completeness
[1:38:03] and now he speaks and he says
[1:38:06] the devil always brings his power first
[1:38:10] he's always there to intimidate
[1:38:13] the first thing that comes out every
[1:38:15] time that god wants to do something the
[1:38:17] devil hops in first he comes and he
[1:38:20] comes with the power of deception a
[1:38:22] powerful intimidation and and we can sum
[1:38:25] up all the works of the devil but him
[1:38:28] says he only has the power of death
[1:38:31] in other words the the best that he can
[1:38:33] do when all is said and done is to bring
[1:38:36] death
[1:38:40] but now we know that the power of the
[1:38:43] blood
[1:38:44] has come and removed the sting of death
[1:38:47] into death
[1:38:49] in other words it's caused death to lose
[1:38:52] its power
[1:38:53] the power that death has to hold the
[1:38:55] believer where you could no longer
[1:38:59] see god or where you were sealed up in
[1:39:02] eternal lost and and everything but we
[1:39:05] understand the power of god when the the
[1:39:08] power of the blood came and manifested
[1:39:10] he came and he removes the sting of
[1:39:12] death therefore death for a believer it
[1:39:14] became a transition into the presence of
[1:39:17] god
[1:39:19] so think about it so therefore when you
[1:39:21] meet the devil today all that he has is
[1:39:24] bluff all that he has is deception
[1:39:28] all that he has is trying to use your
[1:39:31] power against yourself
[1:39:34] because his power that was the power of
[1:39:36] death has been taken away from him now
[1:39:40] but when i'm speaks again about the
[1:39:41] power of decision or power of faith he
[1:39:45] says now the power of faith is the power
[1:39:48] that looks death and he sees the
[1:39:51] resurrection
[1:39:52] it's the power that looks something
[1:39:54] that's completely dead but believe in a
[1:39:57] living god who can come and restore life
[1:40:00] right back into something and bring it
[1:40:02] right back into the condition that it
[1:40:04] was in the beginning
[1:40:08] it says
[1:40:14] he says
[1:40:17] now listen to this
[1:40:24] it says now
[1:40:27] job
[1:40:29] in the bible
[1:40:42] job in the bible
[1:40:46] he says
[1:40:48] who was keeping down the mark
[1:40:51] just for a moment
[1:40:54] not knowing exactly what the holy spirit
[1:40:57] will do that night
[1:40:59] it says we do not understand
[1:41:02] the way he works
[1:41:05] he works in mysterious way he's wanted
[1:41:07] to perform
[1:41:09] now skip a little bit it says job the
[1:41:11] oldest book in the bible
[1:41:14] was supposed to even be written before
[1:41:16] moses wrote genesis
[1:41:19] but the oldest book in the bible was
[1:41:21] speaking of redemption
[1:41:25] listen to this
[1:41:26] and yet redemption was far
[1:41:30] far before
[1:41:32] that
[1:41:33] redemption is one of the oldest things
[1:41:36] in the bible
[1:41:40] did you know redemption was ever before
[1:41:42] the plan of god was laid out before the
[1:41:45] world was even never formed
[1:41:50] god didn't create a seed so he can lose
[1:41:53] it in somebody else's hands
[1:41:56] he didn't make his kingdom so his
[1:41:58] kingdom could be brought to not and so
[1:42:00] he could be left and say how am i gonna
[1:42:02] get my kingdom back
[1:42:04] he's telling you before he can even
[1:42:06] think about anything redemption was the
[1:42:09] very foundation
[1:42:11] god i tell you when you read the bible
[1:42:13] it just bleeds redemption every chapter
[1:42:16] it talks about how people have left you
[1:42:19] can read the whole bible from genesis to
[1:42:21] revelation it will come and condemn
[1:42:23] people how they have left god and went
[1:42:26] into the other gods and everything but
[1:42:28] yet the next chapter will come back but
[1:42:30] if you will turn unto me i will do this
[1:42:32] for you i will do this to you but if you
[1:42:35] return unto me what is it is screaming
[1:42:37] redemption every chapter it's redemption
[1:42:40] it's redemption it's redemption
[1:42:42] why because that's what god is
[1:42:45] is a redeeming god it's a god who can
[1:42:48] never lose what belongs to him if he
[1:42:50] ever done something one way he will
[1:42:53] continue to do until the very end
[1:42:57] he's a redeeming god
[1:42:59] he's the god who at the very end of it
[1:43:03] the celebration is not going to be how
[1:43:05] strong we were or how it's going to be
[1:43:07] the marvelous grace of how god played
[1:43:10] his redemption throughout the whole
[1:43:12] bible
[1:43:21] so he says
[1:43:25] think of it think of that
[1:43:28] god foreseeing
[1:43:30] and making a way of redemption before
[1:43:33] they ever was made the world
[1:43:35] for the bible plainly says that christ
[1:43:39] was predestinated for ordained
[1:43:42] and was the lamb of god slain before the
[1:43:44] foundation of the world that's right
[1:43:46] way before the world was made
[1:43:49] god had
[1:43:51] a plane of redemption
[1:43:56] and i know i won't be able to get
[1:43:58] through all of this
[1:44:02] one of the things
[1:44:03] when you read especially in the message
[1:44:06] everywhere
[1:44:07] you go and you read about redemption
[1:44:12] especially in the message bharanam
[1:44:14] will continually
[1:44:16] speak about the story of boaz in root
[1:44:21] and i probably won't have time to go
[1:44:23] through all of it because
[1:44:26] i don't want to be too long
[1:44:28] but i'll probably just give a summary
[1:44:31] of the he speaks about continually about
[1:44:35] the four stages
[1:44:37] that root has to be in
[1:44:40] in the process of redemption
[1:44:42] typifying
[1:44:44] the process how we are being brought
[1:44:47] back in
[1:44:49] he he says the first stage
[1:44:52] that root had to make a decision
[1:44:56] and
[1:44:59] i i don't want to i hope we all know how
[1:45:01] many knows the story of fruit looking i
[1:45:04] mean
[1:45:06] we we are masters in the bible by now
[1:45:09] you know
[1:45:10] i i joke that you know i'm one of those
[1:45:13] people that
[1:45:14] i always feel bad that you know to go
[1:45:17] preach
[1:45:18] you know someplace i have to be mindful
[1:45:20] because i tend to rely so much on what
[1:45:23] we know you know i i don't break it down
[1:45:26] i just summarize and move forward too
[1:45:28] quickly so
[1:45:30] um
[1:45:31] so he he speaks about the four stages we
[1:45:34] understand she was a moral right and yes
[1:45:36] she is
[1:45:38] and and she was to come but then after
[1:45:41] all the sons died
[1:45:43] we understand that
[1:45:45] he that she had to make a decision
[1:45:47] whether she was going to go with naomi
[1:45:49] or not
[1:45:50] and and bermudem says she had to make a
[1:45:53] decision
[1:45:55] and so is every christian
[1:45:57] has to make a decision
[1:46:00] now i'm talking about redemption
[1:46:03] you you have to make a decision
[1:46:05] what origin you're going back to
[1:46:10] she could identify herself as a moabite
[1:46:13] by her natural birth
[1:46:14] but yet through her marriage
[1:46:17] she could identify as part of the israel
[1:46:20] lineage
[1:46:21] so she had to identify and look at
[1:46:23] ourselves and say am i still a moabite
[1:46:27] am i still going to go back to my
[1:46:29] lineage of what my natural birth was or
[1:46:32] am i going to follow after that which
[1:46:34] has been revealed to me that which i
[1:46:36] have received by marriage
[1:46:39] oh that's why i like when he speaks
[1:46:41] about invisible union your first husband
[1:46:43] had to be killed
[1:46:46] why because he wants you to identify
[1:46:48] with the second marriage not your first
[1:46:51] husband not to by the natural birth that
[1:46:53] you came in but he had to identify with
[1:46:56] the second birth but the second marriage
[1:46:58] and say this is how i decide to go it's
[1:47:01] a decision that everyone sitting here
[1:47:03] has to make
[1:47:06] you know i i thought about you know as
[1:47:09] our young people you know i'll say this
[1:47:11] and perhaps for the older folks it's not
[1:47:14] that much of a challenge but for young
[1:47:16] people you know you have to make a
[1:47:17] decision am i going to be a christian or
[1:47:21] am i going to be try to satisfy both the
[1:47:24] world and be a christian
[1:47:27] you know i i see a lot of people oh you
[1:47:30] know i want to be a youtube star but yet
[1:47:32] i want to be a christian
[1:47:36] i want to be a hollywood star
[1:47:38] but i want to do just christian movies
[1:47:45] i tell you you you think about you think
[1:47:48] as a young person there's no end it's
[1:47:50] like trying to find the borderline of
[1:47:52] what is it that i could do without
[1:47:54] falling
[1:47:58] too close
[1:48:00] too close
[1:48:01] stay in the land
[1:48:03] stay in the land stay as far back as
[1:48:06] possible that's how you make it the more
[1:48:09] you come closer to those things the more
[1:48:12] you will fall because you'll get to a
[1:48:14] confusing line when you don't know the
[1:48:16] difference between the two and that's
[1:48:18] where the devil like to gets people on
[1:48:22] you know how am i going to become an
[1:48:24] undercover agent still be a christian
[1:48:34] how can i satisfy both the world
[1:48:37] and still
[1:48:38] satisfy god
[1:48:40] how can i follow my ambition become a a
[1:48:43] president and the ceo of a major
[1:48:46] corporation
[1:48:49] oh i tell you as people in the corporate
[1:48:51] world you realize those things are not
[1:48:53] mutually exclusive
[1:48:58] how can i become this great person over
[1:49:01] here in the world what everybody knows
[1:49:03] who i am but at the same time still be a
[1:49:06] christian i tell you the place that you
[1:49:08] can be comfortable is the place where
[1:49:10] god places you it's not a place where
[1:49:13] you seek for yourself in other words
[1:49:15] when you go choosing the first question
[1:49:18] that has to come to my mind is how do i
[1:49:20] serve my god in what i'm choosing how do
[1:49:23] i serve my god in the position that i'm
[1:49:25] choosing how do i keep my line correctly
[1:49:28] how do i pick as a christian and know
[1:49:31] that this is not going to compromise me
[1:49:36] i tell you life tries to compromise us
[1:49:38] every day
[1:49:39] you know and as all the folks we only
[1:49:42] stick to what we know if we don't know
[1:49:44] we don't step into it
[1:49:48] you know how about you try this no i
[1:49:50] don't know nothing about that i'll stay
[1:49:51] out here
[1:49:53] how about this no no no no no no i've
[1:49:56] seen enough deception you're not going
[1:49:57] to get me on that
[1:49:59] oh but i tell you in the kingdom of god
[1:50:01] god wants to move us with him he wants
[1:50:04] us to trust his spirit he wants us to
[1:50:06] lead him he wants us to be led by his
[1:50:08] spirit he wants us to know what the word
[1:50:11] says about us and move into it
[1:50:14] but the devil is the one who always
[1:50:16] creates the border line
[1:50:18] you know but one of them speaks about
[1:50:21] having enough holy ghost not to sin not
[1:50:23] to do wrong
[1:50:25] not to say anything bad and
[1:50:28] you know
[1:50:29] and and and satisfy with it
[1:50:31] no that's not the position of the bride
[1:50:34] as a matter of fact let me say this i
[1:50:35] hope this doesn't shock anybody there's
[1:50:38] a major distinction between salvation
[1:50:40] and redemption
[1:50:42] salvation there will be those that will
[1:50:43] be saved at the white throne judgment
[1:50:45] but redemption is bringing into a
[1:50:48] position that already existed
[1:50:50] salvation is bringing you into a place
[1:50:52] where you know the sons of zebedee say
[1:50:55] why don't you place one of my sons to my
[1:50:57] to your left and to my right and the
[1:51:00] mother came and asked jesus and jesus
[1:51:01] looked at him and said that place is for
[1:51:04] a predestinated group of people and not
[1:51:06] predestined a group of people is you
[1:51:08] that are sitting here this morning
[1:51:12] this kingdom belonged to you he gave you
[1:51:15] the earth he gave you the earth so you
[1:51:18] can walk on it so every time you come
[1:51:20] across challenges don't let the
[1:51:22] challenge become greater than your
[1:51:24] possession
[1:51:31] he says one place and
[1:51:33] i don't know if i have it in my notes it
[1:51:35] says
[1:51:36] the power of the devil came in
[1:51:39] as moses was being brought up
[1:51:43] there was nothing but the power of death
[1:51:45] all across and i'm paraphrasing because
[1:51:47] remember
[1:51:48] all the babies were called to die
[1:51:52] and the power of death
[1:51:54] is telling
[1:51:56] the mother in her head saying
[1:51:58] i have been
[1:52:01] commanded by the king
[1:52:03] to swallow it up and kill every baby
[1:52:07] but the power of faith says
[1:52:09] this baby was born a proper child
[1:52:12] this baby was given to me by god
[1:52:15] this baby was promised to me by god
[1:52:18] therefore i'm going to put him in this
[1:52:20] i'm going to put him in this little
[1:52:22] basket and i'm going to place him on the
[1:52:24] water i'm going to send him to death
[1:52:27] with faith that god who gave me this
[1:52:29] child is able to protect him my brother
[1:52:31] my sister to pray over our loved one to
[1:52:34] do all those things it's not a
[1:52:35] complicated matter it's just to find
[1:52:37] ourselves in the scripture and begin to
[1:52:40] claim that which belongs to us
[1:52:42] and let god move on the scene
[1:52:46] the devil likes to complicate things so
[1:52:48] that's over this is over i mean oh my
[1:52:50] goodness it's gotten you don't know how
[1:52:52] far it's gonna go
[1:52:54] i don't care how far he can go i know a
[1:52:57] god a god of restoration one who can
[1:53:00] bring something in the condition that it
[1:53:02] was in the beginning
[1:53:04] in fact he can bring it without a
[1:53:06] scratch
[1:53:11] they took the rod of aaron and
[1:53:13] they put it in the holy of holies now
[1:53:16] think about this this rod was dead
[1:53:20] this rod had no else of life in it
[1:53:24] but because it was standing in the
[1:53:25] presence of almighty god he began to
[1:53:28] buzz and reproduce fruits and everything
[1:53:31] why because god is the god of life
[1:53:34] it's the god of restoration
[1:53:37] if the musician could come
[1:53:40] now
[1:53:41] he speaks about the type of
[1:53:44] let me just read this
[1:53:47] he speaks about
[1:53:49] the believer's identification he says
[1:53:52] oh this really blessed my heart i hope i
[1:53:54] could just read it
[1:53:56] all the way it says
[1:53:58] and to be a true believer
[1:54:01] we have to be the same
[1:54:03] he says we don't we don't want to forget
[1:54:05] that
[1:54:06] it says all that he was
[1:54:09] i'm identified with him
[1:54:11] i'm identified with him he says notice
[1:54:15] he is in me
[1:54:17] he is
[1:54:18] and i in him
[1:54:19] notice then every christian that's real
[1:54:22] genuine christian
[1:54:24] was
[1:54:25] with him
[1:54:27] and he says when the morning star
[1:54:30] sings together and the sons of god
[1:54:32] shouted for joy before there was a
[1:54:34] foundation of the world
[1:54:36] we were identified in the immortal realm
[1:54:39] with god
[1:54:40] 10 million years before the world was
[1:54:43] ever formed was back
[1:54:46] i was back with him
[1:54:48] and i got eternal life
[1:54:50] i was there with him i was identified
[1:54:53] with him when the morning star sings
[1:54:55] together the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:54:57] i was with him when he called
[1:55:01] abraham
[1:55:02] at the age of 75 years old
[1:55:09] that's strong
[1:55:13] how was i in him
[1:55:15] how was i when he called abraham now we
[1:55:18] have to understand the economy of god
[1:55:21] is not one that something happened
[1:55:23] outside of the other god is not true god
[1:55:26] is one god
[1:55:28] god that's why the scripture says if god
[1:55:30] ever done one thing one way he will
[1:55:32] continue to do the same because it's
[1:55:34] part of who he is therefore when he
[1:55:37] called abraham every seed of abraham
[1:55:40] come out at the same time
[1:55:44] that's why he could say when they cross
[1:55:46] the red sea we cross with him
[1:55:51] you say well how was that he's not
[1:55:53] talking about this natural body that
[1:55:55] came by way of sin he's talking about
[1:55:57] the overcoming power that caused them to
[1:56:00] cross the red sea he's talking about the
[1:56:03] the life of god because remember his
[1:56:05] life is the eternal life whatever that
[1:56:08] was in them whatever instruments that
[1:56:10] was in them whatever equipment was in
[1:56:12] them that caused them to do what they
[1:56:14] did that caused them to come out of what
[1:56:16] they came for that equipment is god and
[1:56:19] the same god is operating the same
[1:56:21] equipment today
[1:56:25] and it says it continues on he says and
[1:56:29] stood i was with him in his temptation i
[1:56:32] was there with him when he went up to
[1:56:34] the top of the mountain it says i
[1:56:36] offered up isaac
[1:56:39] when he came to offer up isaac we were
[1:56:41] there that's why now think about this
[1:56:43] he's relating this to when the sons of
[1:56:46] the god shouted for joy in other words
[1:56:49] there was a time before all of this
[1:56:52] could take place where we had knowledge
[1:56:54] of everything that was going to come to
[1:56:56] pass
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:00] now what what what message is he
[1:57:02] speaking is speaking in the message
[1:57:05] spiritual amnesia spiritual amnesia in
[1:57:08] other words we've forgotten these things
[1:57:09] as we move along but the identification
[1:57:12] of the end time is that look you're not
[1:57:15] here now now think about
[1:57:18] oh when he's speaking about the modern
[1:57:20] eagle he says the mother eagle knew that
[1:57:23] he had a baby somewhere he had laid an
[1:57:26] egg somewhere in other words that egg
[1:57:29] was the nature of an ego within it so
[1:57:32] all it took was for the shout to go out
[1:57:34] for the ego to recognize the mother's
[1:57:36] voice and to come back
[1:57:43] if you ask that ego
[1:57:44] are you an eagle
[1:57:46] no
[1:57:48] what do you know about the eagles
[1:57:51] i don't know what you're talking about
[1:57:57] do you know how to fly in the heavenlies
[1:57:59] i don't
[1:58:01] have you ever tried
[1:58:03] why would i even try that
[1:58:08] the nature within that ego
[1:58:11] was bound to what he knew
[1:58:14] from the earth of what it was being
[1:58:15] taught
[1:58:16] scratch here scratch there scratch here
[1:58:19] scratch there scratch here scratch there
[1:58:22] get a little green here get a little in
[1:58:25] fact the eagle was told
[1:58:27] if there were ever gonna come a time we
[1:58:30] know there's this great bird that comes
[1:58:32] above the sky but every once in a while
[1:58:34] it will make a scream and if you hear
[1:58:36] that scream run and hide
[1:58:39] that's the message the eagle was being
[1:58:42] taught that's the church under the eagle
[1:58:44] was sitting run and hide but oh my when
[1:58:47] that eagle heard the sound for the first
[1:58:49] time
[1:58:50] instead of running and hiding that the
[1:58:53] sound made a sense to him
[1:58:57] when you heard the message of the hour
[1:58:59] when you heard the voice of the seven
[1:59:01] angel they told you just as the man
[1:59:04] don't follow a man don't listen to a man
[1:59:07] delicious man's understanding this is
[1:59:09] just man's these people are lost they're
[1:59:12] worshiping men and all those things but
[1:59:14] you hear something within you
[1:59:17] an equipment identifier
[1:59:25] he didn't come and
[1:59:27] took your wings and say fluff it now no
[1:59:29] he says
[1:59:30] fly
[1:59:31] you're like i don't know how to say
[1:59:34] fly
[1:59:35] he said i don't know how to he says you
[1:59:37] were born an eagle
[1:59:40] you were born to fly you were bound to
[1:59:42] be just like me
[1:59:44] you were born to be just in my mind just
[1:59:46] like i am i am here to bring your
[1:59:49] redemption and i want you to follow
[1:59:51] exactly what i'm doing and the eagle
[1:59:54] tried the first time he crashed probably
[1:59:56] try the second time he crashed but oh my
[1:59:58] he kept trying and kept trying and
[2:00:00] pretty soon those wings just opened up
[2:00:03] and the witch just blew him up in the
[2:00:04] air
[2:00:05] what is that redemption there was a
[2:00:08] nature of an english in him and there's
[2:00:11] nothing that could stop him from being
[2:00:12] an ego
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:17] there's not a nature there's nothing
[2:00:19] that can stop you from being a son of
[2:00:21] god you breathe it you talk it you you
[2:00:24] perspire it everything within you
[2:00:27] desires to be the son the daughter
[2:00:33] and all he's doing is
[2:00:36] come
[2:00:37] i have more for you
[2:00:39] like brother matthew was saying come up
[2:00:41] higher i need you to fly a little higher
[2:00:44] i need you he says
[2:00:46] look up
[2:00:48] for your redemption journal
[2:00:50] look to me
[2:00:51] look up to me watch what i'm doing
[2:00:54] and follow the same thing
[2:00:56] why because just as i'm an eagle so are
[2:00:59] you
[2:01:00] let's all stand tonight
[2:01:03] [Applause]
[2:01:10] his identification in us
[2:01:16] where could we go
[2:01:18] where else could we go
[2:01:20] what are the words could we listen to
[2:01:23] it's you that has the eternal life
[2:01:26] when we hear it it takes us into the
[2:01:28] heavenly places we are sitter together
[2:01:31] with you oh god
[2:01:34] that's the understanding we receive from
[2:01:36] this word
[2:01:37] we're not here to scratch around and
[2:01:40] find the grain here and then scratch a
[2:01:42] little more so you can find another
[2:01:44] grain
[2:01:45] you know
[2:01:46] i told you there's still identification
[2:01:49] this is the identification of what the
[2:01:51] world is following
[2:01:52] but then there's the identification that
[2:01:54] comes from him
[2:01:56] that adam could look and say
[2:01:58] look at even say this is flesh of my
[2:02:00] flesh and bone of my born and then adam
[2:02:03] god could look at adam and say i have
[2:02:05] created you in my image well because
[2:02:08] remember we talked about the harmony
[2:02:10] that existed how did adam know what to
[2:02:13] name the animal
[2:02:17] now i'm talking about what we are being
[2:02:19] returned into
[2:02:22] i don't know about you but i'm curious
[2:02:24] to know
[2:02:25] because that's what i'm being returned
[2:02:27] into
[2:02:28] i'm i'm curious to know how did god
[2:02:30] communicate to adam
[2:02:32] this is a this isn't this animal this is
[2:02:35] a lion this is a bear you know i brother
[2:02:38] jackson would joke about a bear can only
[2:02:40] bear a bear you know when i was a young
[2:02:42] preacher that's the first thing i say i
[2:02:44] ever said you know a bear can only bear
[2:02:46] bear you know so here he is the
[2:02:49] identification
[2:02:51] how did he know what those animals were
[2:02:54] how did he know how to call this one a
[2:02:56] lamb and that one a lion and all those
[2:02:58] things how did evil know
[2:03:01] that it was a blood sacrifice that was
[2:03:03] due there was such a connection between
[2:03:06] gods and the seed there was such a
[2:03:08] connection between god and these people
[2:03:10] and i say that's what we desire we don't
[2:03:12] want to hear it from a preacher we don't
[2:03:14] want to hear it from somebody else we
[2:03:16] don't want to hear it just from the time
[2:03:18] i want to hear from god i want to when i
[2:03:21] hear the message i want god to speak to
[2:03:23] me directly
[2:03:25] so i can come in that kind of fellowship
[2:03:30] what did you say
[2:03:32] how did you say it
[2:03:36] so that i can get in that kind of
[2:03:37] relationship
[2:03:42] you know people have this
[2:03:44] oftentimes we look at the manifestation
[2:03:46] of sons and
[2:03:47] yes we will see those things
[2:03:50] but it begins with that relationship to
[2:03:52] understanding
[2:03:54] how were they connected
[2:03:57] now we know that
[2:03:59] he was a god
[2:04:01] he was created in the image of god in
[2:04:04] the fellowship with god and god placed
[2:04:06] in him
[2:04:07] but yet there was a communication where
[2:04:09] god could look down and say i like this
[2:04:13] this is the name that's wonderful
[2:04:16] this is this that's wonderful
[2:04:18] i said god please enter me in that kind
[2:04:21] of relationship where when i do
[2:04:23] something you can look and say that's my
[2:04:25] child
[2:04:26] that's me
[2:04:27] that's my representation i don't have to
[2:04:30] guess work but i have to know what the
[2:04:32] word says and what he wants to do with
[2:04:35] the word
[2:04:37] so i can enter into it let's just pray
[2:04:39] our gracious father we so thank you lord
[2:04:47] lord this world is not our home
[2:04:51] and we desire to be taken into
[2:04:55] that closeness of relationships go then
[2:05:00] where the mighty god can come and be
[2:05:02] unveiled before us
[2:05:06] where we can actually do the works of
[2:05:08] christ and know
[2:05:12] that's he to him in us doing the same
[2:05:14] work that he promised
[2:05:17] god i know as we gather here
[2:05:22] we have desires
[2:05:25] we have things that are going on
[2:05:28] we have our children our young ones and
[2:05:31] our teenagers and
[2:05:33] people caught up into the vortex of the
[2:05:35] world that's out there
[2:05:38] presenting every opportunity load that

[2:05:49] allow a sloth
[2:05:52] to recognize our positions as brothers
[2:05:54] and sisters and
[2:05:55] as mothers and sons and daughters lord
[2:05:58] where we could come in
[2:06:00] and speak your word and say
[2:06:02] i have been made with an equipment
[2:06:05] and that equipment allows me to call
[2:06:07] upon the kingdom of god to come in into
[2:06:10] action
[2:06:12] lord now to merely just scratch and
[2:06:14] scratch scratching scratching
[2:06:17] lord every
[2:06:18] good man
[2:06:20] will never desire his wife to be
[2:06:22] scratching and

[2:06:25] everything
[2:06:27] and we know it's the same with you you
[2:06:29] don't desire your bride to be
[2:06:31] one that will beg and beg and bargain
[2:06:34] but you desire your bride to be one that
[2:06:36] will be representative of you lord
[2:06:39] above all you want her to have your mind
[2:06:41] so she can understand how you work and
[2:06:44] what you desire done with your word
[2:06:47] and lord we pray that you bring us into
[2:06:48] our relationship
[2:06:51] it's first relationship
[2:06:54] then your works will follow lord
[2:06:56] and i pray that you help us get into
[2:06:58] that lord
[2:07:00] because we know that your word is here
[2:07:02] to position us into the place where
[2:07:05] your full maximum power can come and
[2:07:07] flow through us

[2:07:11] hand your hands it we pray that any need
[2:07:14] that's represented here
