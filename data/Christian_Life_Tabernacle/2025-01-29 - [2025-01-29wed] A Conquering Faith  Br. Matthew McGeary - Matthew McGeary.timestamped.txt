[21:00] personal to

[21:04] maybe when he found you that day that
[21:06] you were in need
[21:08] and something became a reality and
[21:11] there's an anchor there and there was
[21:14] something that was spoken to your heart
[21:16] and you know that heavens and earth will
[21:18] pass away but but that'll never pass
[21:21] away you might have gone through some

[23:09] miracle God we
[23:13] believe God we believe
[23:17] for Lord Jesus we just come to you now
[23:21] Lord we believe father because you plac
[23:24] something in us to believe with for that
[23:27] Lord we want to say thank you
[23:29] Lord thank you for that seed that you
[23:32] placed inside of us that would even be
[23:34] able to believe you and to be able to
[23:36] take you at your word Lord and that's
[23:38] why we've gathered here tonight Lord is
[23:40] that we believe you we believe your word
[23:44] Lord and it's it's not something that we
[23:46] did it's because you loved us Lord and
[23:48] we love you because you first loved us
[23:51] Lord when we were unlovable you sought
[23:54] fit to die for us while we were yet a
[23:56] sinner Lord you made a way for us before
[23:59] we even knew we needed a way made and
[24:02] that's why we've come here Lord that we
[24:04] might be able to tell you that we love
[24:06] you and sing a few songs and and thank
[24:08] you for what you've done for us now Lord
[24:11] we come to this portion of the service
[24:14] where we would look to you to come Lord
[24:17] and take your word
[24:19] and start to minister to the hearts and
[24:22] the conditions
[24:24] and the places in people's lives where
[24:27] they're living where
[24:31] the word just goes far beyond some type
[24:33] of theology or some type of religion but
[24:36] it starts to discern the thoughts and
[24:38] the intents of the Heart
[24:40] Lord and we know that you are the same
[24:43] yesterday today and
[24:44] forever we believe that you are present
[24:47] here right
[24:48] now your word says the angel of the Lord
[24:52] in camps around them that fear you
[24:56] Lord then by faith we know that you're
[24:58] standing here in our
[25:01] midst also in our midst Lord our needs
[25:03] in the
[25:05] body there's some people that are
[25:08] riddled with complexes and
[25:11] fear there's some people that
[25:14] are wondering what their mistakes and
[25:17] failures are going to make them
[25:20] become but Lord that's when you come in
[25:22] and you start to whisper Your Love
[25:24] secrets to your bride
[25:26] and start to let us know that
[25:28] everything's going to be all
[25:30] right that you already knew all these
[25:33] things and that you made a way for us
[25:34] out and that if we'll just trust you
[25:38] Lord I want to trust you
[25:41] tonight Lord I was just thinking in my
[25:43] heart as the heavens opened up and the
[25:46] rain started to pour out I thought oh
[25:49] God why not in the Supernatural
[25:53] tonight Lord that the windows of Heaven
[25:55] would open up and there'd be such a a
[25:57] move moving of your Holy Spirit into
[25:59] people's hearts and their lives they'd
[26:01] be so changed Lord not just a a
[26:03] temporary change Lord but an eternal
[26:06] change where your word becomes a reality
[26:08] to them Father Lord that's the God we
[26:11] serve so we look to you
[26:13] now Lord you know in ourselves we've
[26:16] just tried to for a moment look into
[26:19] your word and find something
[26:21] Lord that'd be a blessing to your people
[26:25] but if it ain't for your grace and your
[26:26] mercy and your Holy Ghost to come and
[26:28] take the word
[26:29] and break it to the people Lord then
[26:32] we've come in vain so we surrender to
[26:35] you asking all these things in your
[26:37] lovely name the Lord Jesus
[26:39] Christ amen praise the Lord let's turn
[26:42] in our Bibles my just such a wonderful
[26:44] atmosphere here in the house of
[26:47] God Amen I was just thinking you know if
[26:51] uh if we were in some great sporting
[26:54] event or some concert you know when it
[26:57] was your favorite artist or your
[26:59] favorite team playing those seats
[27:01] wouldn't be
[27:02] empty I mean I was just kind of thinking
[27:05] if brother Brandon was here those seats
[27:07] probably wouldn't be empty you know and
[27:10] that's cuz sometimes we just get caught
[27:12] in a routine you know we kind of get
[27:15] stuck in a
[27:16] routine but they're still
[27:18] open you know I would imagine if I was
[27:21] at a Ranger game or something like that
[27:23] and I saw them seats up there they were
[27:26] empty and I was in the nose bleeds I'd
[27:28] prob
[27:29] start you know Brother David that first
[27:33] second third fourth inning sixth inning
[27:34] say nobody's been up
[27:36] there well there we go
[27:40] Hallelujah we got one coming
[27:43] up hey you know brother brandham said
[27:45] sometimes we got to get out of order
[27:47] long enough to get
[27:50] saved we just get in such a routine
[27:53] where we got our seat in our place we
[27:56] got our job well why don't we just have
[27:59] church

[28:15] backwards so I I I just get too moved by
[28:18] what God did for
[28:20] me because I know how crazy I was out
[28:23] there in the
[28:24] world I was a nut and if you think I was
[28:27] a nut my brother was even even a bigger
[28:29] nut but but but but that's what sons and
[28:32] daughters are of God are we're extremist
[28:35] we we we if we're going to give
[28:36] ourselves to something we're going to
[28:37] give it all to it and it's pretty much
[28:39] that it was that way out in the world
[28:41] well if we're going to serve god let's
[28:42] just serve God with all of our
[28:44] heart you know I'm I'm you know brother

[29:33] by
[29:36] example we're stretched way back there I
[29:39] can hardly see some of you I'm sorry
[29:41] that's just a pet peeve of mine I guess
[29:43] you
[29:44] know somebody's going to move up closer
[29:47] though I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[29:48] watch it
[29:50] happen it maybe we'll start preaching
[29:52] may maybe the fire of God will get to
[29:54] moveing so big and so bright people just
[29:56] forget where they are they'll find
[29:58] themselves at
[29:59] altars you know one time there's a
[30:01] picture of a brother Brandon was sitting
[30:02] on top of the
[30:05] pulpit I mean hey it happens right so
[30:09] all right let's just see what the Lord
[30:11] does
[30:12] tonight I've kind of hopefully broken
[30:14] you out of your routine and we all feel
[30:16] feel all awkward and funny now so let's
[30:19] get moving Romans chapter 4 verse 17 as
[30:22] it is written I have made thee a father
[30:24] of many nations before him whom he
[30:27] believed even God who quickened the dead
[30:29] and called those things which be not as
[30:32] though they were who against hope
[30:35] believed in hope that he might become
[30:37] the father of many nations according to
[30:39] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[30:42] be and being not weak in faith he
[30:44] considered not his own body now dead
[30:47] when he was about 100 years old neither
[30:49] yet deadness of Sarah's womb he
[30:51] staggered not at the promise of God
[30:54] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[30:57] giving Glory unto God and being fully
[31:01] persuaded that what he had promised he
[31:03] was able also to perform you may may
[31:07] have your seats I want to speak uh this
[31:09] evening by the help of God if I if the
[31:12] Lord would just Quicken this this uh uh
[31:15] little thought to us and uh we certainly
[31:17] need his help and his grace to come and
[31:20] and magnify and and illuminate but I
[31:22] want to speak on an aspect of faith if I
[31:24] could say an action of Faith or
[31:26] something that Faith does
[31:28] and you know we've we've heard the the
[31:30] phrases of
[31:34] um well praise the Lord we've heard the
[31:36] phrases of you know uh uh perfect faith
[31:39] and common faith and we've we've heard
[31:42] phrases of uh of of um rapturing Faith
[31:47] right we've heard all these kind of
[31:48] things have we
[31:50] not but I want to say that there there's
[31:52] there's there's faith has to become a
[31:55] reality right faith has to be become
[31:58] something that is real to you faith has
[32:00] to become something that when it's
[32:02] revealed to you no matter what the the
[32:04] the circumstances are no matter what
[32:06] happens no matter what comes your way
[32:09] that faith is such a revelation that
[32:12] when all of the symptoms and everything
[32:14] shows up there's an anchor that is in
[32:16] your soul that regardless of what you're
[32:18] looking at that heavens and earth will
[32:20] pass away but God's word will never pass
[32:23] away is that right come on there has to
[32:27] there has to be a reality there has to
[32:29] be something that is in your soul
[32:32] something that is so anchored that when
[32:34] the Devil comes and he tries to buff at
[32:36] you when the Devil comes and he tries to
[32:38] start uh uh telling you you're not who
[32:40] you are there's something in you that is
[32:44] anchored there's something in you that
[32:46] is anchored that regardless of what the
[32:48] devil would try to say regardless of
[32:50] what the devil would try to do there's
[32:52] something that's more real to you than
[32:54] the five
[32:56] senses amen
[32:59] I've never had this happen so I could
[33:01] just preach without notes I've I've done
[33:03] it many
[33:04] times but let me see if I can get this
[33:07] straightened out but we're we're we're
[33:09] reading out of Romans chapter 4 and
[33:11] we're just speaking on the aspect of
[33:12] faith in our text Abraham called those
[33:15] things were which were not as though
[33:18] they
[33:19] were right so so maybe it maybe just
[33:22] think about a promise or something in
[33:25] your life that that maybe that you're
[33:27] believing for and it seems like you
[33:29] haven't received
[33:30] it come on maybe maybe you feel like you
[33:34] haven't received the promise of God and
[33:36] and and it's something you're believing
[33:38] for and it doesn't seem like it's in
[33:39] your possession but I want to say if you
[33:41] have faith and you believe that God has
[33:44] given you the promise then by faith you
[33:46] do possess the
[33:47] promise and then what you do is you
[33:50] start calling those things which are
[33:53] not right you start calling those things
[33:55] which are not as though they were so
[33:58] then you start speaking
[34:01] it right Abraham was strong in faith
[34:05] given Glory unto God so what was he
[34:07] doing he was speaking the
[34:10] word are you with me
[34:12] amen so Something That Came Upon My
[34:15] Heart Is as we just think about all
[34:17] these uh all these uh you know Common
[34:21] faith and perfect faith and rapturing
[34:23] faith and all these things I I want to
[34:25] just uh bring out maybe another way of
[34:28] saying it uh uh and speak to you of
[34:32] a conquering
[34:35] Faith a conquering Faith now I'm getting
[34:39] I'm getting excited because the devil's
[34:41] fighting and he he didn't just start
[34:44] fighting this evening he started
[34:46] fighting earlier today and and I've
[34:49] learned one thing when the devil starts
[34:52] fighting you just might as well start
[34:54] getting
[34:55] excited you know when when you when you
[34:57] got Wednesday night church a a and man
[35:00] you're finally ready and it's
[35:03] early I'm finally going to get to church
[35:07] early and and the baby dumps out a whole
[35:10] bowl of spaghetti on your your dress
[35:12] shirt and you're like you got to be
[35:13] kidding
[35:14] me that's when you might as well say hey
[35:17] you know what something good is going to
[35:19] happen something good is in store if if
[35:22] things are happening like this and I I'm
[35:24] starting to get upset that maybe maybe
[35:26] the devil's just trying to cause some
[35:28] problems so I want to talk to you as a
[35:30] subject conquering Faith but but if I
[35:33] can maybe just gather myself for a
[35:35] moment Abraham called those
[35:38] things my title this evening is When
[35:40] Faith
[35:43] speaks When Faith speaks and I just was
[35:47] I I I had I had opened up perfect faith
[35:49] and I was reading this quote here and uh
[35:52] brother brandom would say in perfect
[35:54] Faith paragraph 146 he says you're a
[35:56] Christian
[35:58] you have a right to any Redemptive
[36:00] blessing that Jesus died for you it's
[36:03] all yours it's already paid for you just
[36:06] have to believe it not imagine it but
[36:09] believe it and know that it's yours and
[36:12] you can possess it oh that's conquering
[36:16] Faith now I was just I and this is just
[36:19] you know God deals with ministers Hearts
[36:21] different ways and and sometimes maybe a
[36:24] specific way more often than others and
[36:26] as I was just pondering that conquering
[36:28] faith I just felt the Lord speak to my
[36:30] heart and say faith that speaks or the
[36:35] voice of
[36:37] faith faith has a
[36:40] voice Faith speaks and that's what we
[36:42] want to talk about in minister to you on
[36:44] tonight is When Faith speaks and as a
[36:47] subject conquering faith and so just
[36:49] continuing on in this quote brother
[36:51] brand says he knew it would happen
[36:53] before he could predict that it would
[36:55] happen because he knowed it would happen
[36:57] and whatever he predicted come to pass
[36:59] now watch whatever he said God honored
[37:01] what he said think of that whatever
[37:03] Jesus said God brought it to pass so he
[37:06] knowed his words were God's
[37:08] words that's what you got to know is
[37:10] what you're speaking is God's words not
[37:13] just speaking what you think you want
[37:15] but you got to be speaking the word of
[37:17] God by a revelation now look that same
[37:19] scripture comes right back into us if
[37:22] you say to this
[37:24] mountain now I I just want to
[37:26] distinguish something really quick
[37:28] because it says if you say to this
[37:30] mountain and and and that's what I love
[37:32] this thought of where our pastor's
[37:33] taking us to the path forward look we're
[37:35] moving forward if you say to this
[37:37] mountain not the guy in the
[37:40] mirror not that guy you wake up in the
[37:43] morning and you're looking at the mirror
[37:45] and you're going if you
[37:47] say that guy in the mirror let you
[37:50] down but not the you in the mirror the
[37:53] you in the
[37:55] word there's a difference
[37:59] there's a difference between the youu in
[38:01] the mirror or the youu in the
[38:04] word so the guy in the mirror is your
[38:07] worst
[38:08] enemy if you haven't figured that out
[38:10] yet you
[38:11] will when you start fighting against it
[38:14] and wanting to do things for the Lord
[38:15] you'll find out you got to bring that
[38:16] thing under
[38:18] subjection you got to let it know
[38:21] something if you say to the
[38:24] mountain and so just a moving on brother
[38:28] Brandon would say and why Christ speak
[38:30] he says uh in paragraph
[38:33] 176 he says Moses with his faith never
[38:36] did fear Pharaoh see he didn't care what
[38:39] Pharaoh said he cared not about Pharaoh
[38:43] no no more than his mother and his daddy
[38:45] cared about their threats when Moses was
[38:47] confirmed to him and he was that person
[38:51] that was to deliver Egypt or lead Israel
[38:53] out of Egypt he never cared what Pharaoh
[38:55] said he wasn't scared of him now would
[38:59] say if there was anybody to be scared of
[39:01] it would have probably been
[39:06] Pharaoh class
[39:08] participation I mean he was the most
[39:10] mightiest man in the world by by the
[39:13] natural Senses at the time he said
[39:16] there's no fear in
[39:18] faith faith knows about it Faith as I've
[39:21] always said it gots great big muscles
[39:23] and hairs on its chest Faith said shut
[39:26] up and everybody and everybody shuts up
[39:29] that's all I know where I I'm talking
[39:32] about faith
[39:35] speaking I think it's time for us to
[39:37] allow the faith in us to start speaking
[39:40] start speaking the word faith said shut
[39:42] up and everything shuts up that's all I
[39:45] know where I'm at the rest of them say
[39:47] well then maybe he does see but you've
[39:49] got to stand up and show your muscles
[39:53] that's all Faith does it so faith has a
[39:58] voice Faith speaks Faith stands up and
[40:02] flexes its
[40:05] muscles come on faith speaks out Faith
[40:10] flexes its muscles or faith shows its
[40:13] muscles that's what Abraham was doing
[40:16] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[40:18] God but was strong in faith giving
[40:21] Glory unto God what was he doing he was
[40:25] standing up in the face of the critics
[40:27] he was standing up in the face of the
[40:29] doctors he was standing up in the face
[40:32] of all the theologians and everybody
[40:34] that told him look there's no way that
[40:36] you can do it but what was Abraham
[40:38] Abraham was
[40:42] persuaded do you know what it means to
[40:44] be
[40:46] persuaded Abraham was persuaded that the
[40:49] one that gave him the
[40:52] promise some of us just need to get
[40:55] persuaded some of us just need to get
[40:58] convinced then you get concerned some of
[41:01] us you you're persuaded that if you show
[41:03] up to work on time you're going to get a
[41:05] check on Friday you're persuaded of
[41:08] it but I tell you what you're putting
[41:11] your faith in the wrong thing cuz that
[41:12] company could go belly up look look out
[41:15] in La people had a job and overnight the
[41:19] fire come through and burnt everything
[41:20] to the
[41:21] ground I I'm sure their Persuasions
[41:25] gone but if you're persuaded by faith
[41:29] heavens and earth will pass away but
[41:31] there's one thing that won't pass away
[41:32] and that is the word of God I say it's
[41:34] time we be persuaded by the word of
[41:39] God he was persuaded what God would God
[41:42] would perform what he promised and I
[41:45] like how he says that that that he
[41:47] didn't fear
[41:49] Pharaoh he didn't fear what Pharaoh
[41:52] could do to Moses he wasn't fearing that
[41:54] thing because he knew that God had
[41:56] called him right to lead the children
[41:59] out of Egypt he said you'll come back to
[42:01] this mountain and worship me therefore
[42:03] there was nothing that pharo could do to
[42:06] stop the word of
[42:08] God now remember we want to put
[42:10] ourselves in the
[42:13] story you said
[42:15] it I believe it well by God's grace
[42:18] we'll get down to the word and what he
[42:20] has spoken concerning
[42:22] you brother Brandon would talk about
[42:25] Peter and he would talk about Peter how
[42:27] how you know they were out on the boat
[42:29] and it looked like some spooky figure
[42:31] came came out there on the water and
[42:33] they started to wonder my goodness what
[42:35] what is this and all of a sudden Peter's
[42:37] like Lord if that be you bid me
[42:41] come a prophet of God said Peter was
[42:43] doing all right until he got
[42:47] scared Peter was doing all right before
[42:50] he got scared he said Lord if that be
[42:51] you bid me
[42:54] come I don't know what's if you can turn
[42:56] this screen on right here because it's a
[42:58] lot of stuff going on the back
[43:00] here um he said Peter was doing all
[43:04] right until he got
[43:06] scared but Lord if that be you bid me
[43:09] come he said come
[43:13] on God you told me to come
[43:16] on your word says for me to walk then
[43:20] I'm going to start
[43:21] walking you think about that until that
[43:25] time I from all I know that was you know
[43:27] there was a man walking on the water and
[43:29] his name was
[43:30] Jesus and second later by faith Peter
[43:33] stepped out of the boat there was two
[43:35] men walking on water a man that didn't
[43:37] even have the Holy
[43:39] Ghost think of it now but enough Faith
[43:43] because he always was a Son of God he
[43:44] always was predestinated there was
[43:47] always the power of transformation in
[43:48] him there was always something there he
[43:50] believed God he took him at his word he
[43:52] stepped out on the boat and he started
[43:54] walking
[43:57] but when he got to looking at the
[43:59] symptoms now I I want to uh uh remind us
[44:02] we're talking about going
[44:06] forward we're we're talking about moving
[44:10] beyond the conditions and maybe moving
[44:13] into a higher height and into a greater
[44:15] realm than where we have been
[44:18] living where we come to a place that by
[44:21] faith we accept what God has done for us
[44:24] we believe what God has made us
[44:27] we believe that he has a purpose and a
[44:29] plan for our life we know that we're
[44:32] called we know that we're
[44:34] Justified there is therefore now no
[44:37] condemnation come on if there's
[44:39] condemnation in your life then you're
[44:41] you're you're missing something because
[44:44] there's a place that you can come to
[44:45] where you meet the Lord and all the
[44:47] condemnation is gone that your past is
[44:50] turned into a testimony you're just like
[44:53] the woman at the well now those things
[44:55] that once enslaved you now those things
[44:57] that once had you in bondage now those
[45:00] things that used to torment you become
[45:02] the tools that you can use to witness of
[45:05] his grace and His glory oh Hallelujah I
[45:09] like
[45:11] that so we we're having a revelation of
[45:13] who we are no more condemnation we know
[45:16] that we're anointed for the job why
[45:18] Christ speak the word
[45:21] yes but I point this out what the
[45:24] prophet of God said in perfect Faith
[45:26] speaking of Peter he said what he feared
[45:33] happened if you're afraid of losing your
[45:35] job watch
[45:37] out we had a brother that preached here
[45:39] a long time ago and he was so scared a
[45:41] deer was going to jump out in front of
[45:43] his
[45:44] car he got anxiety over you know what
[45:47] happened a deer jumped out in front of
[45:50] his
[45:53] car Satan will try to put something in
[45:55] your life and cause you to fear fear and
[45:57] the prophet of God is saying but I want
[46:00] to say just as easy it is to fear look
[46:02] at
[46:02] this he said what he feared happened
[46:05] what he
[46:06] believed
[46:08] happened when he believed he could walk
[46:12] he
[46:15] walked when he believe when he when he
[46:18] believed and got scared in his
[46:22] belief then his substance left
[46:25] him see
[46:27] he still professed his
[46:33] faith but he didn't have the
[46:38] substance I say isn't that the picture
[46:42] of many of the Believers
[46:45] today one day you're walking on the
[46:48] water Hallelujah bless God I'm going in
[46:52] the rapture we had a wonderful service
[46:54] we had a some wonderful meetings praise
[46:57] God I'm victorious in the next minute
[46:59] Lord I'm drowning I'm going down I can't
[47:03] stay above water Lord help
[47:06] me come
[47:09] on it ain't ought to be that
[47:12] way what one minute you're up the next
[47:15] minute you're
[47:18] down that's that's okay that it's
[47:21] quiet cuz many of us are in that
[47:24] condition and you shouldn't be
[47:28] and if that's where you're starting off
[47:29] I want to tell you there's higher
[47:30] Heights you ain't got to stay like that
[47:33] if you're up and down at least you're up
[47:35] and down at least you're calling out to
[47:37] the Lord and the Lord's there to save
[47:39] you the Lord's there to help you that's
[47:40] all right if you're going down say Lord
[47:42] help me the Lord wants to pull you up
[47:44] but he don't want to pull you up so you
[47:46] go back down if you go back down he'll
[47:49] pull you back up but I want to tell you
[47:52] that there's been a word that has been
[47:53] opened up to the bride of Christ in the
[47:55] end time that he'll pull you up out of
[47:58] the mck and mire and he'll set you upon
[48:00] the rock of Revelation that you can
[48:02] never go down
[48:05] again
[48:10] Hallelujah you're called to be
[48:14] victorious one day
[48:17] Sanctified the next day you're
[48:20] struggling one day you're wearing your
[48:22] dress long and the next week you're
[48:23] rolling it back up again
[48:27] one one one year you're growing your
[48:29] hair long and then and then you cut it
[48:30] off and you got to grow it again that's
[48:33] all right you're struggling you're up
[48:35] and down you're up and down but there is
[48:37] a
[48:37] revelation and the Lord is here wanting
[48:40] to pull you into higher
[48:45] Heights we're going
[48:51] on faith knows no defeat
[48:56] feet isn't an option yes
[49:01] sir Moses didn't fear
[49:05] Pharaoh when David met
[49:10] Goliath fear and doubt what did what did
[49:14] Goliath tell David he said you're just
[49:15] but a
[49:17] youth see the symptoms and the
[49:20] opposition tells you well you're just a
[49:22] young person or you haven't been serving
[49:24] the lord that long or or or you're not a
[49:27] real Warrior you know uh you you you
[49:30] don't have any schooling or education or
[49:33] what real battles have you gone through
[49:35] you you've just grown up in the church
[49:37] on the Pew and and your parents have
[49:39] applied the token you've never really
[49:41] overcome
[49:43] anything now that's what the devil's
[49:46] saying that that's maybe what the doubt
[49:49] in the unbelief is saying but I want to
[49:51] say there's another
[49:52] voice there's a voice of the word I want
[49:55] to tell you that speaks back that's
[50:00] right Faith told Goliath said look when
[50:03] I was out there tending my father's
[50:05] sheep there was a lion that came and I
[50:08] slew that lion well there was a bear
[50:11] that came and I slew the bear and I want
[50:12] to tell you oh Goliath you're going to
[50:15] be just the same as them for the god
[50:17] that justified me the god that
[50:19] Sanctified me the god that filled me
[50:21] with the Holy Ghost is the same God
[50:23] that's going to take your head off
[50:24] Goliath Goliath you're going down what
[50:27] was it that was Faith speaking
[50:31] back so why are we being quiet Church
[50:35] why cist
[50:43] speak Faith spoke
[50:48] back I was thinking about that brother
[50:51] brandom he tells uh a story about a
[50:54] brother came to him and told him about a
[50:56] dream he said brother gram I had this
[50:58] dream and and in this dream that the the
[51:02] devil came to me you know almost like a
[51:05] ghost the Spirit came to me the devil
[51:06] was there and the devil kept going up to
[51:08] me and saying boo and I jumped
[51:11] back and you say boo and he jumped back
[51:14] again and he said every time the devil
[51:16] said boo and I jumped back he got bigger
[51:19] and bigger and
[51:22] bigger and he
[51:25] realized I'm going going to have to face
[51:28] this
[51:30] thing come on maybe something's been
[51:33] telling you boo boo it's been coming
[51:36] after you maybe you feel like you get
[51:38] the victory for a season maybe you feel
[51:40] like you get the victory for a month but
[51:42] that thing comes back and says boo I'm
[51:44] back and you jump back and you oh what
[51:46] am I going to do what am I going to do
[51:48] and the Temptation starts to grow and
[51:50] you feel like you can't turn your head
[51:52] anymore and you you're you're starting
[51:54] to you feel that thing coming over and
[51:56] all a sudden before you know you're
[51:57] giving in but what did he say he said I
[51:59] realized I had to face that thing
[52:01] eventually so I looked around he said
[52:04] and the only thing I knew I took my
[52:08] Bible and when that spirit said boo he
[52:11] said boo
[52:12] back and when he took the word and said
[52:15] boo he noticed that it got
[52:18] smaller and so he took the word of God
[52:21] and said boo and it got smaller and he
[52:24] kept taking the word of God and said boo
[52:30] devil prophet of God said that's what
[52:33] you need to
[52:35] do he said you don't need to tell the
[52:37] devil boo he said but take the word of
[52:40] God and say thus saith the Lord boo
[52:44] devil and that thing that's been
[52:46] tormenting you that thing that's giving
[52:48] you problems I want to tell you when the
[52:50] voice of Faith Rises up according to the
[52:53] word of God go ahead and speak the word
[52:56] boo devil back
[52:58] up I'm a Son of
[53:01] God I come to do
[53:04] battle on a Wednesday night yeah on a
[53:07] Wednesday
[53:09] night you mean when half of the church
[53:11] is gone yeah when half of the church is
[53:13] gone you mean when the pews look kind of
[53:16] yeah that's when God shows
[53:21] up boo
[53:23] devil When Faith speaks
[53:27] now I'm not talking about a hope
[53:29] so I'm talking about
[53:32] knowing that God promised it and that
[53:35] settles
[53:38] it that's what you have to do Church
[53:40] take the
[53:41] word it's thus saith the
[53:48] Lord one time there was a sister in the
[53:52] scriptures she had a blood issue I
[53:54] believe for over 25 years
[53:57] she had spent everything she had done
[53:59] all she could do insurance dried up no
[54:01] more money no more resources the doctors
[54:04] and everybody said that's just going to
[54:06] be the way it is and you just might as
[54:08] well die in that
[54:11] condition everything was
[54:14] pointing to a hopeless
[54:17] case but from
[54:20] somewhere something rose up inside of
[54:24] her and said it was a
[54:27] voice something spoke in our heart if I
[54:31] can just touch the hym of his
[54:35] garments I want to tell you though when
[54:38] Faith speaks it don't stand
[54:41] still Hallelujah When Faith speaks it
[54:45] don't stand still it puts you
[54:48] into
[54:50] action and something in her heart said
[54:52] well I've tried all the doctors I've
[54:55] tried everything out but there's
[54:57] something in my heart that's saying if I
[54:59] can just Touch the Hem of His Garment oh
[55:02] he she started pressing her way she
[55:04] moved from the back of the church up
[55:06] into the front of the church because she
[55:07] was tired of being a lukewarm believer
[55:10] she said oh my I spent all my living but
[55:13] if this God be God if I can just touch
[55:16] the hym of his garden I will be
[55:20] healed Faith went into
[55:24] action I say that's where we're moving
[55:26] moving into church is faith that gots
[55:29] hair on its chest faith that has action
[55:31] behind what it believes and what it
[55:38] says who touched
[55:40] me Lord what do you
[55:44] mean this is a different
[55:48] touch oh I wish we could see into the
[55:52] supernatural realm right now the Lord is
[55:55] passing through this
[55:58] building oh come on brother Matthew
[56:00] you're being a fanatic he's here right
[56:05] now that's another scene just like in
[56:07] the
[56:08] scriptures he's walking
[56:11] through and I wonder if he'll
[56:14] stop this evening and
[56:17] say who touched
[56:21] me look over and somebody's going to say
[56:24] it was me have a need
[56:27] Lord faith faith is rising up Faith is
[56:31] speaking out tonight I'm claiming
[56:34] something matter of fact it's not the me
[56:37] and the mirror it's the me and the word
[56:40] if you say to the mountain this was not
[56:42] just a man speaking this is deity
[56:44] speaking because the word is in me
[56:46] anointed by the Holy Ghost and that is
[56:49] deity
[56:50] talking who touched me
[56:56] thy
[56:58] faith has made thee
[57:02] whole Faith rose up and
[57:05] said if
[57:07] I can Touch the Hem of His
[57:10] Garment see when Faith speaks it don't
[57:12] sit
[57:14] around Faith goes into
[57:17] action I would just want to clear
[57:19] something up
[57:22] maybe help somebody if something in your
[57:25] heart says I'll go up for prayer and be
[57:29] healed now not just a
[57:31] wondering not a hoping so but with a
[57:34] perfect Faith according to the
[57:37] word now a lot of people if you're not
[57:40] careful you stop at paragraph 42 in
[57:44] perfect faith when brother brandom says
[57:46] look if you have if you have faith why
[57:49] you standing in the prayer
[57:52] line and all of a sudden you start to
[57:54] feel like well well well what am I going
[57:56] to
[57:57] do but why don't you just go all the way
[58:00] to the end of paragraph
[58:02] 179 and brother brandom says now if you
[58:04] have if you feel like you got perfect
[58:07] Faith come into the prayer line but if
[58:10] you don't feel like you got perfect
[58:11] Faith don't come in the prayer line
[58:12] because you're just taking somebody
[58:13] else's
[58:14] time and you sit back and say I'm
[58:17] confused brother brand no no there
[58:19] there's no confusion here because
[58:22] remember we we have the phrase common
[58:24] Faith it's rapturing Faith perfect Faith
[58:28] conquering Faith what faith comes by
[58:31] hearing the word and faith is a
[58:34] revelation a revelation of what a
[58:36] revelation of the word so then faith if
[58:39] faith is speaking in your heart
[58:41] according to the word you know what I'm
[58:43] going to go get uh prayed for uh call
[58:45] for the elders and they're going to lay
[58:46] hands on me and I will be healed then
[58:49] that's Faith
[58:52] speaking if you're sitting right there
[58:55] and and in your are you inspired you say
[58:57] you know what by his stripes I'm already
[59:00] healed I don't need to go through the
[59:01] prayer line then that is Faith
[59:04] speaking one doesn't take away from the
[59:07] other it's all a revelation of the word
[59:10] it's all the word speaking
[59:14] back you can be a a
[59:18] mature son or daughter of God my and and
[59:22] and and and you're living real close to
[59:25] God
[59:27] and God just put it on your
[59:29] heart why didn't you go up and be prayed
[59:31] for that need to be
[59:33] healed and then you're like well I
[59:36] don't Lord I don't need to you said by
[59:40] your stripes I'm
[59:42] Healed but maybe he wants to manifest
[59:46] that portion of word in your
[59:49] life maybe it's not for you at all maybe
[59:52] it's for somebody else to say you know
[59:53] what if God can do that for brother
[59:56] brother Matthew he can do it for
[59:59] me the important thing is that you're
[1:00:01] being obedient to the word of God you're
[1:00:03] being faithful to what the word says
[1:00:08] Do Lord you
[1:00:11] said Lord you
[1:00:13] said if you've met God's
[1:00:16] requirements come on some of you
[1:00:18] believing for the Holy Ghost you've
[1:00:20] turned over every Rock every stick
[1:00:22] you've done all you know to do well then
[1:00:24] I say stand if you you repented of your
[1:00:26] sins and you're living a Sanctified life
[1:00:28] the best way that you know how and
[1:00:30] you're believing for the baptism of the
[1:00:31] Holy Ghost and you say Lord I've gone to
[1:00:34] the water I I I I've repented of my sins
[1:00:37] I've been baptized in the name of the
[1:00:38] Lord Jesus Christ and you said
[1:00:41] Lord if you've met God's requirement
[1:00:44] there's no need to
[1:00:46] fear there's no
[1:00:48] condemnation if you've prayed and God
[1:00:50] seems silent Faith doesn't waver Faith

[1:27:37] conversations sometimes it's not
[1:27:39] discernment sometimes it's your own
[1:27:41] thoughts but when you're in love with
[1:27:43] him the prophet says your life shows
[1:27:46] it we can
[1:27:49] see you ain't full of

[1:27:59] in your life look we've turned the
[1:28:01] corner we ain't worrying about being
[1:28:03] Pentecostal we're not worrying about
[1:28:05] getting worked up we're not worrying
[1:28:07] about being identified with this

[1:28:14] going to shout I'm going to run if I
[1:28:15] feel to scream shout and run I'm going
[1:28:17] to cry I'm going to lay in the presence
[1:28:19] of God at the altar if that's what the
[1:28:21] spirit's moving on me to do because one
[1:28:23] thing I'm sure not afraid of is being
[1:28:26] identified with the Holy Spirit no
[1:28:28] matter how it wants to move in the
[1:28:29] church service if it wants to be a
[1:28:31] victory dance and a victory march let it
[1:28:34] come if it's Sovereign and laid out on
[1:28:36] the altar in the presence of God let it
[1:28:39] come all I want to say is Let It Come

[1:29:04] me I don't know how long I've been but I
[1:29:06] don't think it
[1:29:07] matters what matters is if your Soul's
[1:29:10] right what matters if you if you've met
[1:29:16] him and just trying to turn the corner
[1:29:19] here

[1:29:38] yours right
[1:29:40] now now I just want to say
[1:29:44] this not just so you can be
[1:29:48] blessed see that's the
[1:29:51] Trap you go to church you get blessed
[1:29:54] you go back out in the world and you get
[1:29:55] beat down you come to the church and
[1:29:57] you're blessed you go back on the world
[1:29:59] and you're beat down that is not the
[1:30:02] cycle God has called you to
[1:30:05] live and God is Not Just blessing us
[1:30:07] just to be blessed sometimes he
[1:30:10] does you go to church and he'll he'll
[1:30:12] pour out the blessings on nonseed and
[1:30:14] seed and we'll all have a great
[1:30:16] wonderful
[1:30:17] time and a few ticks of the calendar you
[1:30:20] can't even remember when it was or if it
[1:30:22] ever happened
[1:30:24] and that's all
[1:30:26] right I love it when the Lord blesses
[1:30:28] you so much you can't even remember what
[1:30:29] where and when and how it
[1:30:31] was we should live like that we're the
[1:30:33] children of
[1:30:35] God but not just to be
[1:30:39] blessed but that you can have faith in
[1:30:43] what he has accomplished through
[1:30:45] Redemption and be what he made you and
[1:30:49] do what he called you to do
[1:30:55] all right so now now we're moving
[1:30:57] forward all right we're
[1:31:00] delivered we're set
[1:31:02] free we we we mean business with God
[1:31:06] we're living a Sanctified
[1:31:08] life let this mind be in you that was
[1:31:10] also in Christ Jesus what did Jesus
[1:31:13] say I sanctify myself for their
[1:31:17] sake you want to know why I'm a
[1:31:20] fanatic and I'm conservative with my
[1:31:22] music because I'm sanctifying myself for
[1:31:27] their sake you know what I'm a fanatical
[1:31:30] and I'm
[1:31:31] conservative with my entertainment
[1:31:34] because I'm trying by God's grace to
[1:31:36] sanctify myself for their sake you know
[1:31:39] why I want my wife and my kids to dress
[1:31:43] conservative for the glory of God
[1:31:45] because we must sanctify ourselves for
[1:31:48] their sake why are we trying to get so
[1:31:51] close to the edge
[1:31:55] what
[1:31:57] happened but there ought to be a love
[1:31:59] affair and a love relationship oh God I
[1:32:03] wouldn't want to do something that
[1:32:04] displeases you I'm going to stay as
[1:32:07] close as I can to the mountain I'm going
[1:32:09] to stay as close to the rock as I can
[1:32:12] Lord does this outfit please you Lord oh
[1:32:15] if there's a question I stay away from
[1:32:16] it if you can't do it in Jesus name you
[1:32:19] stay away from it principles faith has
[1:32:21] spoken to your heart through the Malachi
[1:32:24] 4:5 behind everything there's a spirit
[1:32:26] motive and objective you know why I stay
[1:32:28] away from
[1:32:30] this music out there that's sung by all
[1:32:32] the churches and
[1:32:34] denominations because behind everything
[1:32:37] there's a spirit motive and objective
[1:32:39] and if they believe in a
[1:32:41] trinity and Devils
[1:32:44] travel in those titles and you're
[1:32:47] listening to their
[1:32:50] music what has happened to the
[1:32:55] church do you think brother brandom
[1:32:57] would listen to that
[1:32:59] nonsense that rock and roll I didn't
[1:33:02] mean to go here we're going forward
[1:33:04] we're going to go forward I'm moving
[1:33:05] past that stuff right we I'm sorry I'm
[1:33:07] sorry we've already we've got down to
[1:33:09] business we've thrown out all
[1:33:11] the new age denominational Christian
[1:33:15] music we've deleted the Christian radio
[1:33:18] in our
[1:33:19] car you know I remember times growing up
[1:33:22] people got so serious with God they got
[1:33:25] rid of their radio they got rid of their
[1:33:28] music cuz they were getting down to
[1:33:31] business they were sanctifying their
[1:33:33] life and you find out when you get the
[1:33:35] Holy Ghost and it gives you power over
[1:33:38] that thing then you got that thing
[1:33:41] whooped Marvels to me when you go into a
[1:33:44] restaurant and you see a Believer
[1:33:45] tapping their foot to the worldly
[1:33:48] music looks like it still got the hook
[1:33:50] in
[1:33:51] them but we're moving on
[1:33:54] why because God has a plan and a purpose
[1:33:58] for your
[1:34:00] life just as Jesus had come with a
[1:34:04] specific purpose to fulfill what was
[1:34:07] spoken of him each one of you in Eternal
[1:34:12] thought of God now made flesh in this
[1:34:15] decree season is now fooling the purpose
[1:34:18] that God intended for you to
[1:34:21] fulfill so what he did as a forerunner
[1:34:25] he went ahead of you and removed all the
[1:34:29] obstacles that would prevent you from
[1:34:31] becoming what he called you to
[1:34:34] be like I said it was
[1:34:38] rigged are you hearing
[1:34:40] me just a few more moments are you
[1:34:42] hearing me everything the devil would
[1:34:45] try to throw in your way God has already
[1:34:48] given you the victory over
[1:34:51] it so all you got to do is take your
[1:34:54] faith and speak to the
[1:34:58] mountain you know what you ought to do
[1:35:00] if you got a really big trial in front
[1:35:02] of
[1:35:03] you because you know little
[1:35:07] trial a little
[1:35:10] Victory right that's why in sports you
[1:35:13] know they want to be the champion well
[1:35:15] if you g to be the champion what do you
[1:35:16] got to
[1:35:19] do you got to beat the
[1:35:22] champion so if you got a great big
[1:35:25] obstacle in front of you just say man
[1:35:27] praise God he knew I could handle this
[1:35:30] cuz he said he'd never give you more
[1:35:31] than you could
[1:35:33] bear why don't you just start being like
[1:35:35] Caleb be like boy look at all them long
[1:35:38] necks on my
[1:35:39] Mountain I'm going to cut their head off
[1:35:43] you might as well start getting
[1:35:45] excited are you hearing me you might if
[1:35:48] you got a big trial in front of you that
[1:35:50] means you got a big victory coming amen
[1:35:54] it's about time you say Bo devil back up
[1:35:58] it is written thus sayith the Lord I'm
[1:36:00] going through I'm going to speak to my
[1:36:05] Mountain brother brandham says this in
[1:36:07] perfect Faith he says talking about
[1:36:09] Jesus said therefore he relied upon what
[1:36:11] God had made him and if he did that
[1:36:14] can't we rely upon what God made us as
[1:36:17] Believers these signs shall follow them
[1:36:20] that believe he had faith in what he was
[1:36:23] and if you are a
[1:36:25] Believer you have faith in what you
[1:36:31] are you mean I'm supposed to have faith
[1:36:34] in what I
[1:36:36] am you're supposed to have faith in what
[1:36:39] you are what are
[1:36:41] you I am a
[1:36:46] believer what does a Believer do it
[1:36:49] doesn't believe the five senses and
[1:36:51] that's what drives the devil and the
[1:36:53] world crazy because you have something
[1:36:55] they don't have you have something
[1:36:58] that's looking at something they can't
[1:37:04] see you have
[1:37:06] faith he goes on in paragraph 68 maybe
[1:37:10] five more minutes he says now the only
[1:37:12] thing you have to do
[1:37:13] then is have faith in what you
[1:37:18] are so we we're putting this to
[1:37:21] bed all right you're you're saved you're
[1:37:25] Sanctified you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:28] there's therefore now no
[1:37:30] condemnation amen now I want to tell you
[1:37:33] how easy it is if somebody is sitting
[1:37:35] here right now and you're
[1:37:39] condemned and in your
[1:37:42] heart you know what you've done is wrong
[1:37:45] and you want to make it right right now
[1:37:47] in your chair you say
[1:37:49] Lord I made a horrible
[1:37:51] mistake and I really didn't mean to do
[1:37:54] it and I never want to do it again
[1:37:57] Lord I want to identify with a sacrifice
[1:38:00] Lord you went to Calvary and I don't
[1:38:03] mean just lip service say Lord I'm sorry
[1:38:06] I'm turning away from
[1:38:09] it I'm going to walk away from it Lord
[1:38:12] I'm going to walk away from that
[1:38:14] relationship I've been doing things I
[1:38:16] shouldn't be doing I know it's
[1:38:18] embarrassing but you just
[1:38:22] repent he's just TR and faithful to
[1:38:24] forgive
[1:38:25] you and it's thrown in the sea of God's
[1:38:29] forgetfulness you don't have to do
[1:38:32] penants you're
[1:38:34] free you're free that that's how easy
[1:38:36] that was maybe somebody right now you
[1:38:39] just got the victory you're free from
[1:38:41] that Old Devil been trying to tempt you
[1:38:43] and hold you down now you're
[1:38:45] free you ain't got to come to the altar
[1:38:47] your altar is in your heart you say Lord
[1:38:50] I am sorry I I've definitely done things
[1:38:53] I shouldn't have done Lord I plead the
[1:38:55] blood now let let he's forgiven you that
[1:38:58] you can start to have faith in what he's
[1:39:00] made you he's made you an
[1:39:04] overcomer he placed you in the ladyo and
[1:39:07] age that you would fulfill the word that
[1:39:09] has been spoken by Malachi 4:5 not just
[1:39:12] a word of justification or you would
[1:39:15] have been born in the days of
[1:39:17] Luther not just a message of of uh uh we
[1:39:21] said justification now not just a
[1:39:24] message of sanctification under Wesley
[1:39:26] or you'd have been born in that age not
[1:39:28] just an outpouring of the gifts or
[1:39:30] you've been born back in the early 1900s
[1:39:32] but God has reserved you for now that
[1:39:35] you would fulfill all the word of God
[1:39:38] that has been spoken and opened up to
[1:39:41] the bride through the revelation of the
[1:39:43] Seven
[1:39:45] Seals that that Revelation now would be
[1:39:48] manifested in
[1:39:50] you what was being opened up through
[1:39:52] that third pool what was it speak the
[1:39:54] word speak to the mountain where we saw
[1:39:57] a man stand on the earth positionally
[1:40:00] once again just like
[1:40:02] Adam he spoke to the storm he said storm
[1:40:05] go back to where you
[1:40:07] were what was it it was an Eden
[1:40:10] condition even so much the deer started
[1:40:13] to come around and say Adam is that
[1:40:15] you they weren't scared they weren't
[1:40:18] running around and what he was changed
[1:40:19] back to a young man again th this is the
[1:40:22] thoughts of God for for you because that
[1:40:24] was a first one to maturity amen and now
[1:40:27] you are now coming into that same matur
[1:40:30] that's the purpose and plan for your
[1:40:32] life not not to just just just be
[1:40:35] struggling every day and oh I'm a sinner
[1:40:37] now I'm saved I'm a sinner no we're
[1:40:39] we're now we're going forward to walk
[1:40:42] into all these things that have been
[1:40:43] opened up to us that you can have faith
[1:40:45] in what you are have faith in what the
[1:40:47] word says you
[1:40:50] are now that that would take a lot of a
[1:40:53] lot of time there but if I can just say
[1:40:56] this that's why God sent a
[1:40:59] prophet to tell you who you
[1:41:05] are you didn't know who you
[1:41:08] were just like Eve didn't know who she
[1:41:11] was but
[1:41:13] God brought her to Adam and Adam said
[1:41:17] you're bone of my bone and your Flesh of
[1:41:19] My Flesh God sent elaser
[1:41:23] come
[1:41:25] on Malachi 4:5 to introduce you to the
[1:41:29] bridegroom and the bridegroom looked at
[1:41:31] you and said you are now bone of my bone
[1:41:33] you're Flesh of My Flesh your life of my
[1:41:35] life your power of my
[1:41:37] power is that not what the word says you
[1:41:41] are then have
[1:41:43] faith in what he's not in the guy in the
[1:41:47] mirror we're going past that right have
[1:41:49] faith what the word says you are as
[1:41:52] Jesus had faith in the word of God that
[1:41:55] said what he was it is written of me
[1:41:57] didn't David in the Psalms and the
[1:41:59] prophets and all them speak of him and
[1:42:01] say I am the bread of life that come
[1:42:03] from God out of Heaven amen I am that
[1:42:05] tree of life from the Garden of Eden I
[1:42:08] am all these things I am that I am and
[1:42:12] he knew with that perfect faith that he
[1:42:15] was the anointed Messiah that the spirit
[1:42:19] of God was upon him he said now I in my
[1:42:23] s do nothing but it is my faith in God
[1:42:27] and God was in him the word made
[1:42:29] manifest and when the word of God comes
[1:42:31] in you uhoh here's where we all shrink
[1:42:34] back not
[1:42:36] me what's he trying to
[1:42:39] do he's showing how Christ manifested
[1:42:42] the word and because of what Redemption
[1:42:45] has accomplished now he wants to produce
[1:42:48] the same overcoming life in his bride
[1:42:51] and he says and when the word word of
[1:42:53] God comes in you it's manif made
[1:42:55] manifest for you are a
[1:42:59] Believer now we're trying to come
[1:43:01] towards a close
[1:43:03] quickly brother bandam goes on and says
[1:43:06] says this so just pointing that out we
[1:43:11] have to have faith in what the word says
[1:43:13] we
[1:43:14] are and when you start to have that kind
[1:43:17] of
[1:43:18] faith and I'm not talking about a hop so
[1:43:21] faith
[1:43:23] but if I could say it like this a faith
[1:43:25] that
[1:43:26] speaks where you start speaking the
[1:43:32] word confession is made under salvation
[1:43:35] the scripture says life and death is in
[1:43:37] the power of tongue you got to start
[1:43:39] putting the word on your mouth and
[1:43:41] speaking the word if you say to that why
[1:43:44] cry
[1:43:46] Moses if you're in the line of duty
[1:43:49] speak the word and go forward
[1:43:53] paragraph 93 said Jesus had perfect
[1:43:56] Faith now this is where we're just
[1:43:59] honing down to a close he says and he
[1:44:02] had Jesus had perfect Faith he had it
[1:44:04] and it come because he was the
[1:44:08] word is everybody okay are right y'all
[1:44:12] ready for the final stretch we're coming
[1:44:14] to a
[1:44:15] close some people love that like finally
[1:44:17] the sky is coming to a close you said
[1:44:19] that 30 minutes ago we're we're we're
[1:44:21] we're on the last lap here okay
[1:44:23] okay here we come he
[1:44:26] says Jesus had perfect faith and it it
[1:44:29] come because he was the word and you
[1:44:32] become the
[1:44:33] word you become the word as you receive
[1:44:37] the
[1:44:39] word oh
[1:44:44] Hallelujah you become the word as you
[1:44:48] receive the word that's why he could say
[1:44:50] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:44:53] he said as the I was in the father and
[1:44:54] the father in
[1:44:56] me he said at that day that's this day
[1:45:02] when this
[1:45:04] Revelation when the seventh seal has
[1:45:07] been revealed at that day then it's no
[1:45:10] longer I and him and him and me but now
[1:45:13] it's I and you and you and
[1:45:16] me oh Hallelujah the word declaring not
[1:45:21] only who he is but declaring who you
[1:45:25] are you become the word as you receive
[1:45:27] the word if you abide in me and my words
[1:45:29] in
[1:45:30] you this word abides in you then ask
[1:45:32] what you will and it'll be done unto you
[1:45:33] see if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:45:37] and don't doubt but believe in what you
[1:45:39] have said then you shall have what
[1:45:42] you've
[1:45:43] said when you say to the
[1:45:47] mountain he said that puts you right
[1:45:49] back in the
[1:45:51] word so then who is it
[1:45:53] speaking it's the god in you it's the
[1:45:57] attribute of the word that you are in
[1:46:00] you speaking back the word that's
[1:46:02] already been spoken to
[1:46:04] you because you're becoming the word as
[1:46:07] you receive the word so you might as
[1:46:08] well start speaking the
[1:46:15] word if you say to this mountain be
[1:46:18] moved and don't
[1:46:19] doubt if the musicians would come I I
[1:46:23] just want to say this when your
[1:46:27] calling becomes your
[1:46:30] calling you might be called to do
[1:46:32] something but when you become the word
[1:46:35] that's calling
[1:46:36] you if I can say that your life starts
[1:46:40] to speak out the word it's one thing to
[1:46:43] be called to do something but when you
[1:46:45] start to fulfill that calling you become
[1:46:48] what you were called to
[1:46:50] do it brings the realities of the
[1:46:53] supernatural into your life just one
[1:46:58] moment so I I just really want you by
[1:47:01] faith right
[1:47:02] now to start speaking the
[1:47:06] word I am a son and daughter of God I
[1:47:10] can do the Greater Works I can lay hands
[1:47:15] on the sick and they shall recover I
[1:47:18] will possess this vessel in

[2:00:34] Anointed with the Holy Ghost went about
