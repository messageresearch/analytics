[24:38] identify itself with the word when you
[24:41] when you see where you come from when

[24:46] um as you go around

[41:00] there's nothing more important than
[41:02] revelation
[41:05] lord i see so much
[41:07] [Music]
[41:09] people trying to establish their
[41:11] position and their
[41:13] doctrine and their faith and
[41:16] what they believe is right and what they
[41:19] believe
[41:19] is wrong every little
[41:23] statement gets taken apart
[41:29] and i just think of the words that you
[41:32] spoke

[41:38] come follow thou me
[41:42] and lord just to have that individual
[41:45] personal relationship let your word

[42:21] just bless your word to us now we pray
[42:24] in jesus name amen
[42:28] if you have your bibles let's turn
[42:33] over in the book of
[42:37] exodus in the 12th chapter of the book
[42:41] of exodus
[42:59] let's start with the 22nd verse
[43:02] and
[43:09] and let's just read the 13th verse
[43:11] before we jump
[43:13] to the 22nd verse and thus
[43:16] and the blood shall be to you for a
[43:19] token
[43:21] upon the house where ye are
[43:24] and when i see the blood i will pass
[43:27] over you and the plague shall not
[43:32] be upon you to destroy you
[43:35] when i smite the land of egypt
[43:39] and then on the 22nd verse and ye shall
[43:42] take
[43:45] a bunch of hips up and dip it in the
[43:48] blood
[43:49] that is in the basin and strike the
[43:52] lineal
[43:53] of the two sides of the post with the
[43:56] blood
[43:57] that is in the basin and none of you
[44:01] shall go out of the door of this house
[44:04] until morning for the lord will pass
[44:07] through
[44:08] and smite the egyptians and when he
[44:11] seeth the blood
[44:12] upon the lineal and the two
[44:15] sideposts the lord will pass over
[44:18] the door and ye shall not suffer the
[44:22] destroyer
[44:23] to come into your house and smite you
[44:26] and you shall observe this thing
[44:30] for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons
[44:34] for ever and it shall come to pass
[44:38] when ye become to the land
[44:42] which the lord will give you according
[44:45] as
[44:45] he hath promised that ye shall keep
[44:48] this service and it shall come to pass
[44:52] when your children shall say unto you
[44:55] what meaneth ye by this service
[44:59] that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of
[45:02] the lord's passover
[45:04] who passed over the house of the
[45:06] children of israel
[45:07] in egypt when he smote the egyptians
[45:11] and delivered our home our houses
[45:14] and the people will bow the head and
[45:18] worship
[45:19] and the children of israel went away and
[45:22] did
[45:22] as the lord had commanded moses
[45:25] and aaron so they did father we ask you
[45:29] to bless your word
[45:30] in your precious name we pray amen
[45:36] and you may be seated
[45:42] the man makes this statement he says
[45:46] they think just because they belong to
[45:49] church
[45:50] that it's that is all that's necessary
[45:54] oh brother that means no more to god
[45:56] than to be
[45:57] a mason or anything else or
[46:00] any lodge to belong to church
[46:03] that don't mean nothing to god you've
[46:06] got to be a
[46:07] son and daughter of god you've got to be
[46:10] born of god and god is the word
[46:15] and when i come and
[46:18] when i come part of
[46:22] my father i become all
[46:25] my father when you become
[46:28] part of god you become
[46:31] god in full his whole word
[46:34] you believe all of it
[46:38] any man and he said basically anything
[46:40] less than that
[46:42] is spiritual amnesia so we talked
[46:45] this morning and about that spiritual
[46:49] amnesia is a disease
[46:52] we can look tonight and see that a lot
[46:54] of people have suffered from it that
[46:56] they forgot there was a
[46:58] evening service you know and
[47:01] and that's okay because we're going to
[47:04] talk tonight
[47:05] maybe they're listening we would hope so
[47:08] but we're going to talk tonight about
[47:10] way
[47:11] the way to fight spiritual
[47:14] amnesia amen that that's what we want to
[47:18] know i believe the prophet
[47:20] certainly identified it this morning
[47:23] as a disease and and that in fact he
[47:26] actually said it he says this is a
[47:29] disease
[47:30] and it is contagious and we tried to
[47:33] point out this morning
[47:35] that it it it wasn't a
[47:38] a a preaching idea or it wasn't a
[47:42] text you know i will use the
[47:45] thought of amnesia to to draw a text
[47:50] to preach on certain things and and it's
[47:53] not a cliche
[47:54] you know or you tell somebody well you
[47:56] just got amnesia
[47:57] you know what i mean uh but it was
[48:00] actually described to us
[48:03] this morning a messenger
[48:07] telling the people that this is an
[48:10] actual real
[48:13] living alive spiritual
[48:17] disease that is affecting people
[48:22] and we found out that that disease could
[48:25] be
[48:26] passed along it's contagious
[48:29] so you can catch spiritual amnesia
[48:33] from somebody they can they can cause
[48:36] you
[48:37] to get amnesia and we understood
[48:40] what amnesia is is somebody who forgets
[48:44] who they are and where they're going
[48:47] they they don't have any memory
[48:51] and so they don't know where they're
[48:54] they don't know who they are
[48:56] they don't know where they come from and
[48:58] they don't know
[48:59] where they're going so we find out
[49:03] that the way to fight spiritual
[49:06] amnesia is by way of remembrance
[49:10] you've got to remember either you
[49:12] remember
[49:13] or you've forgotten i use that word a
[49:17] lot
[49:17] more lately here as i've added a few
[49:21] marks
[49:22] on the calendar you know we were
[49:25] i think leslie and i were talking and
[49:28] this november
[49:29] i believe it'll be our 49th uh
[49:32] wedding anniversary you know well you
[49:35] know i can't remember all of it
[49:38] you know and uh but it it
[49:41] what we'll do sometimes is we'll
[49:44] maybe talk about certain things certain
[49:47] places we've been certain times
[49:49] we at certain things will remember and
[49:52] leslie is a picture taker
[49:54] if you don't know that i can she got a
[49:57] picture of every restaurant i've ever
[49:58] eaten in
[50:00] so i can certainly go back over and look
[50:03] at those things but sometimes a picture
[50:07] brings up a memory and they have
[50:11] something that they call memorabilia
[50:14] it's certain things that you have
[50:17] in order to remember
[50:20] but remembering the lord was a
[50:23] a very important thing and that was
[50:26] god's complaint
[50:28] about israel time and time again
[50:31] was that they forgot
[50:34] they forgot you forgot you forgot what
[50:38] i've done for you you you
[50:40] forgot you forgot the name of the lord
[50:42] you forgot to serve me
[50:44] you forgot my commandments and
[50:47] and and we know that
[50:50] one of the things that pleases god is to
[50:54] remember him
[50:55] so we find out here in exodus
[51:00] we find out that
[51:03] the lord delivered israel
[51:06] and it was a mighty deliverance by a
[51:09] mighty hand
[51:11] it wasn't it wasn't just a weak
[51:14] escape the scripture doesn't say that
[51:19] the israelites snuck out one night
[51:23] and the egyptians couldn't find them
[51:27] no this deliverance was so
[51:30] powerful that the
[51:33] i mean i i just i love it i just get it
[51:37] actually makes me just chuckle inside
[51:40] they looted the land
[51:43] they borrowed money from all the
[51:46] egyptians
[51:47] knowing they would never pay it back
[51:50] i mean they just took everything
[51:54] they took trees they took plants they
[51:57] took
[51:57] gold they took money they took fruits
[52:01] the egyptians says take whatever you
[52:04] want just get out of here
[52:08] so massive and so
[52:12] powerful was the hand of the lord in
[52:16] their deliverance that
[52:18] i love the statement that's made
[52:21] in the film uh ten commandments
[52:25] when finally pharaoh sits on
[52:29] the altar and his wife is
[52:32] chatting him and he finally looks at her
[52:35] he says
[52:36] moses says god is god
[52:39] and and i just i just get thrilled
[52:42] over that story you know what i mean if
[52:45] you left
[52:46] egypt because of you shouldn't have
[52:49] been wanting for nothing when you
[52:52] left egypt and so they did a great
[52:55] ravage
[52:56] of the land and they had money and they
[52:58] had everything they needed to go
[53:00] in and and and so moses commanded them
[53:04] you keep this service you do this
[53:09] by way of remembrance
[53:12] to remember i don't want you to forget
[53:17] what that i did for you that i
[53:20] smoked the firstborn i smote the first
[53:23] cat the first mouse the first cockroach
[53:27] because whatever it was
[53:29] in egypt he smote every firstborn
[53:33] creature in the land the
[53:36] the scripture describes him as the
[53:38] destroyer
[53:40] he came through and he utterly destroyed
[53:44] egypt and and that was the
[53:47] the power of god and so god
[53:51] wanted to remember
[53:55] and that's what keeps you from
[53:58] having amnesia where you forget
[54:02] and we understood this morning that
[54:04] amnesia
[54:06] was a disease and therefore it started
[54:10] out in small steps
[54:13] that you could start getting a little
[54:14] bit of amnesia that's what he said he
[54:16] says you've got a little amnesia
[54:19] work in here you bought it you've got to
[54:21] be careful
[54:22] and then if he made the statement don't
[54:24] get it don't get amnesia don't get this
[54:27] so we try to push it past the place
[54:31] in our hearts and our minds and
[54:33] understanding it's as
[54:35] real as this so-called
[54:39] uh virus that's going on now
[54:42] now is it amazing that the natural types
[54:45] the spiritual
[54:46] here's this great virus going on and yet
[54:49] spiritually there's another virus at
[54:52] work
[54:53] there's another spirit at work another
[54:57] disease at work so we understand that we
[55:00] can start
[55:01] getting this he said pastors get it
[55:05] deacons get it you know
[55:12] so i guess we could all get it so
[55:15] when we get it we need to know a way to
[55:18] fight it
[55:20] we need to know what's the cure for it
[55:24] and the cure for amnesia is remembrance
[55:28] so we want to we want to be able to
[55:32] remember the lord a good sermon
[55:36] is remember the lord and that's
[55:39] why we have communion communion is one
[55:42] of the things
[55:43] that god instituted so can you say
[55:46] well he said keep this service forever
[55:52] well when it came over to the new
[55:55] testament
[55:57] in in that in that second exodus
[56:01] when it moved over to that exodus jesus
[56:04] celebrated the passover and he took
[56:07] bread and now he reinstituted that
[56:10] passover
[56:11] in a new exodus and so
[56:14] now that passover in that new exodus
[56:18] was do you this in remembrance of me so
[56:21] now they were
[56:22] celebrating the same
[56:26] service but now the service
[56:29] was done in memorand so he said he
[56:32] delivered
[56:33] it was in remembrance of the great
[56:35] destroyer and the great deliverance
[56:38] by the blood on the doorpost the blood
[56:40] of the lamb
[56:41] now there was the lamb
[56:45] and his blood was going to keep the
[56:47] destroyer
[56:48] off of us so he instituted communion
[56:53] as being a what a way of
[56:57] remembrance and that's what he said so
[57:00] he said
[57:01] that it's by a way
[57:04] of remembrance so i want to just talk
[57:07] about ways that
[57:09] that we can keep god on our minds
[57:13] and in our hearts by way of remembrance
[57:17] we should remember the lord every day
[57:20] amen amen the scripture tell us make
[57:24] melody in your heart uh edify yourselves
[57:28] with psalms
[57:29] and songs and and things of edification
[57:32] because
[57:33] if you don't resist this spirit of
[57:36] amnesia
[57:37] it will you will get it
[57:40] okay it's not a it's not a sermon title
[57:44] it's not a it wasn't a thought
[57:48] to use as preaching it's an
[57:51] actual spiritual disease
[57:55] that actually exists forgetting the lord
[58:01] failing to remember the lord people that
[58:04] don't come and take communion
[58:06] have amnesia they just did
[58:10] because that's what he said he said as
[58:12] long as you come together
[58:14] you keep this service forever
[58:17] in remembrance of the deliverance that
[58:20] you see
[58:21] received by the sacrificial lamb
[58:24] and that's why we have communion so we
[58:27] want to
[58:28] start looking at ways that and i wrote
[58:31] down
[58:32] some of these just as a a believer and
[58:35] some of them are the things that
[58:37] i try to practice and things that we
[58:40] just want to share because we're
[58:42] brothers and sisters but
[58:44] one of the ways to remember
[58:47] the lord is to see the invisible
[58:52] things of god in the visible things
[58:56] around us paul stated in romans
[59:00] that they are without excuse
[59:04] they didn't want to retain god in their
[59:06] thinking
[59:08] but he said they are without excuse
[59:11] because the invisible things of god
[59:15] are clearly seen in the invisible in the
[59:18] visible things around us
[59:20] so we should be able to see god and just
[59:23] think
[59:24] when these things become so common to us
[59:28] and and they become just they almost
[59:31] become
[59:31] scientific and and the science of it
[59:36] and all the knowledge that we have and
[59:38] everything that
[59:39] the science has done the purpose of that
[59:42] science
[59:43] was to cause us to forget that it was
[59:47] god
[59:47] that created the stars it was god that
[59:51] hung
[59:51] the stars it was god that framed the
[59:54] earth
[59:55] and that was peter's complaint he said
[59:58] they they don't remember that it was god
[1:00:01] that framed the earth
[1:00:04] you go read it in peter he talks about
[1:00:06] that they for they forgot
[1:00:08] that god was the creator and they forgot
[1:00:11] that one day he's going to destroy it
[1:00:14] but they didn't want to keep that so how
[1:00:16] do we keep
[1:00:17] god in our mind we look to god and we
[1:00:21] see the invisible things
[1:00:22] we look to the creation
[1:00:26] and we remember that god created the
[1:00:29] heavens and earth
[1:00:31] that it was created science wants to
[1:00:34] have a different uh explanation
[1:00:39] they want to show and it's describe it
[1:00:42] by science we know how fast light moves
[1:00:46] we we know we can shoot a man up into
[1:00:49] space
[1:00:50] and bring them back down and they've
[1:00:53] scientifically
[1:00:54] explained they talk about the tithe and
[1:00:57] they talk about the moon and they
[1:00:59] they've got it
[1:01:00] all figured out
[1:01:04] but they they don't want to retain
[1:01:07] the creator
[1:01:10] and so we can't forget that the very
[1:01:14] world we live on was formed
[1:01:17] by god and and we don't want this
[1:01:21] amnesia
[1:01:22] just to slip in
[1:01:26] so when we step out our doors we need to
[1:01:28] hear the birds singing
[1:01:30] we need to watch the clouds we need to
[1:01:33] look at the grass
[1:01:35] what's that saying that they always said
[1:01:38] stop and smell the
[1:01:39] flowers well so many of them are fake
[1:01:44] nowadays you know but but the real
[1:01:47] things of god
[1:01:48] are real you understand you've got to
[1:01:51] see god real
[1:01:52] remember the little boy asked what the
[1:01:54] guy who he was fishing with where's god
[1:01:57] and the man's just started to start to
[1:01:59] running down the face
[1:02:00] he said he's everywhere i see him in the
[1:02:03] water i see him here
[1:02:05] i see him everywhere if you're not
[1:02:08] seeing god
[1:02:09] in the world that's around you you don't
[1:02:12] see the creation of god
[1:02:14] you don't see the magnificence of god
[1:02:17] then you've got
[1:02:18] amnesia caused by science
[1:02:23] so how do you fight that you take it
[1:02:26] beyond
[1:02:27] the science and you take it back to the
[1:02:30] beginning
[1:02:32] our very book that we live by
[1:02:35] starts with in the beginning
[1:02:38] god created
[1:02:43] that's where we go back we go back with
[1:02:46] all that's going on
[1:02:48] the the real world not man's perversion
[1:02:51] of it
[1:02:52] but the real order and the real creation
[1:02:56] in the real sun and moon and stars and
[1:02:59] all those things
[1:03:00] was made as god expressing himself
[1:03:03] that we could see the invisible things
[1:03:06] of god
[1:03:07] in the visible things around us so we're
[1:03:10] we were we don't have an excuse for
[1:03:13] getting this amnesia
[1:03:14] this is one of the things that god gave
[1:03:17] us to fight
[1:03:18] amnesia
[1:03:21] is seen him in his creation ask
[1:03:24] ourselves
[1:03:25] how often do we stop
[1:03:30] and worship god in his creation
[1:03:33] we worship our dashboard
[1:03:37] we worship our computer screen
[1:03:40] because we're spending all our time in
[1:03:42] front of it
[1:03:44] and and those are the things that allow
[1:03:47] this amnesia to get on you
[1:03:53] you know and so uh that's one of the
[1:03:57] things that
[1:03:58] god gave us to fight spiritual amnesia
[1:04:02] was the glory of his creation
[1:04:07] i thank god for it don't you
[1:04:11] amen another thing that you want to do
[1:04:14] and we saw in this scripture
[1:04:18] remember to fight amnesia
[1:04:22] you have memory
[1:04:27] amnesia is the loss of memory
[1:04:31] and identification you don't have
[1:04:35] anybody to identify with i don't
[1:04:38] identify with that i don't identify with
[1:04:41] that
[1:04:42] there's a a a lot of things that are in
[1:04:46] the world that
[1:04:47] i i just don't identify with i'll tell
[1:04:49] you one thing i don't identify with
[1:04:51] and that's jogging
[1:04:56] i see those people running down the
[1:04:58] street i want to get out and lay hands
[1:04:59] on them
[1:05:02] really hey
[1:05:05] don't register know i know people that
[1:05:08] love to jog
[1:05:11] i i don't know i could probably use some
[1:05:14] of it but i don't identify with it
[1:05:17] and so you you've got to have
[1:05:20] you you've got to have something you
[1:05:22] identify with and so
[1:05:24] one of the things to do is bring to your
[1:05:27] remembrance
[1:05:28] his mighty works
[1:05:31] bring to your remembrance this is the
[1:05:34] god that you're identifying
[1:05:36] with what is it that you're identifying
[1:05:38] with well we're
[1:05:39] we're identifying uh uh with
[1:05:43] the mighty works he did in egypt as we
[1:05:46] saw here
[1:05:48] but this is a god that sent a prophet
[1:05:50] there and he created fleas
[1:05:52] and he created frogs and and he
[1:05:55] created turned the water to blood and
[1:05:58] had
[1:05:59] hail stones fall down what are you
[1:06:01] remembering
[1:06:03] you're remembering how mighty this god
[1:06:06] is
[1:06:06] that we serve that he parted the waters
[1:06:10] that he did those things and by
[1:06:12] remembering those things
[1:06:15] and bringing those things to your
[1:06:17] remembrance
[1:06:18] and remembering the mighty works that he
[1:06:21] did
[1:06:22] now you're remembering what it is that
[1:06:24] you're identifying with
[1:06:26] i'm identifying with a god that has is a
[1:06:29] mighty god
[1:06:32] that his works and and his might is
[1:06:35] wondrously to be performed it's it's
[1:06:38] powerful we've sometimes got to remind
[1:06:42] ourselves that our
[1:06:43] god is powerful
[1:06:46] that all things are under his feet
[1:06:50] that we're not serving a religion
[1:06:54] we're children of the mighty
[1:06:58] creator we're children of god
[1:07:01] and if you don't remember that and you
[1:07:04] don't dwell on that
[1:07:06] and you don't take time to remind
[1:07:08] yourself
[1:07:10] and edify yourself
[1:07:14] and then you forget
[1:07:17] all that he's done to show that he's god
[1:07:22] then it starts to slip from you
[1:07:26] so we're talking about tonight you in
[1:07:28] other words you have got to go out
[1:07:30] and fight this disease look at everybody
[1:07:34] out there staying six feet away from
[1:07:36] another
[1:07:36] they're putting masks on their face
[1:07:39] they're washing their hands
[1:07:41] you know i'll tell you according to
[1:07:43] scripture you can't wash your hands of
[1:07:44] it
[1:07:47] you just know that story right
[1:07:50] know your stories so anyway
[1:07:53] so uh we look at those things we talk
[1:07:56] about
[1:07:56] jericho remember jericho
[1:08:00] remember the story of rahab how many is
[1:08:03] identified with rahab
[1:08:05] sure we have lost and in sin
[1:08:09] and something come by and and told us
[1:08:12] you remember those stories you got to
[1:08:14] look at those stories you got to keep
[1:08:15] them alive
[1:08:16] you got to go read them you've got to
[1:08:19] get in and
[1:08:20] marching around the city seven times the
[1:08:22] walls were so
[1:08:24] thick that you could ride a
[1:08:27] chariots on them but then that trumpet
[1:08:30] sounded
[1:08:32] oh now can't you get into all the types
[1:08:36] amen the wall come dumbling down the
[1:08:38] trumpet sound and
[1:08:40] joshua the holy spirit the mighty angel
[1:08:44] uh deliverance and ec and so
[1:08:47] you've got to go back and and and and
[1:08:50] remember those things
[1:08:53] you've got to keep them alive in your
[1:08:55] memory if not
[1:08:57] all you're looking at is this
[1:08:59] present-day
[1:09:01] confusion
[1:09:04] you're only seeing what's before your
[1:09:06] eyes
[1:09:08] and when you see what's before your eyes
[1:09:10] you've got to remember
[1:09:11] that there's a god that has delivered
[1:09:14] people
[1:09:16] all down through time you got to
[1:09:18] remember
[1:09:19] that you serve a mighty god you need to
[1:09:22] be reminded of how
[1:09:23] mighty he is you've got to go look at
[1:09:26] his history
[1:09:28] look at what he's done look what's put
[1:09:30] on
[1:09:31] in charge what's been laid out before us
[1:09:34] to show if you do that then you are
[1:09:37] fighting this disease
[1:09:41] that whole purpose is is to get you to
[1:09:46] forget
[1:09:48] even jesus looked at his disciples and
[1:09:51] said
[1:09:52] you are worried
[1:09:55] because you brought no bread
[1:09:59] have you forgot
[1:10:03] the loaves and fishes and the baskets
[1:10:06] and
[1:10:06] and all the things you've already forgot
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:12] you see because the
[1:10:15] the whole purpose of satan's
[1:10:17] civilization
[1:10:19] is to get us tied up
[1:10:23] to where our minds are
[1:10:26] occupied because the battle's in our
[1:10:29] mind
[1:10:30] and if he can get our minds off the
[1:10:33] things of god
[1:10:34] then amnesia can start to set in
[1:10:37] so you remember you remember jericho
[1:10:40] remember
[1:10:41] david and goliath
[1:10:44] you know you guys type that out in your
[1:10:47] life
[1:10:48] put yourself in the story put yourself
[1:10:52] in the types giddy and daniel
[1:10:54] you know remember those things remember
[1:10:57] his judgments
[1:10:59] noah uh samson
[1:11:03] you say wait a minute sam says yeah
[1:11:05] samson was judgment
[1:11:07] he killed more philistines in his death
[1:11:11] he brought the whole place down so these
[1:11:14] are the kind of
[1:11:16] gods that we serve
[1:11:21] this we've got to remember the god we
[1:11:23] serve
[1:11:25] he's personal and he's mighty
[1:11:28] okay why do you know why is it important
[1:11:32] to know what he's done because we know
[1:11:35] if he's
[1:11:35] did it anytime one way
[1:11:39] he'll do it again
[1:11:42] so if you put yourself in the story if
[1:11:45] you've got a goliath
[1:11:47] then you know that you're a david you
[1:11:49] identify with the story
[1:11:51] you you use the story to type your life
[1:11:55] to type out what's going on in your life
[1:11:58] you look at the stories you look at
[1:12:00] those
[1:12:00] those things you place yourself in it
[1:12:03] you said this same
[1:12:04] god that did it for them can do
[1:12:06] something for me he's a creator
[1:12:10] he creates solutions
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] he he changes things the scripture says
[1:12:18] that prayer
[1:12:19] changes things and
[1:12:22] and so you do that you say well why are
[1:12:24] we talking we know these things
[1:12:26] but you've got to know that why these
[1:12:29] things are been placed in god's word
[1:12:32] that has been placed in god's words
[1:12:34] because they're for you to fight the
[1:12:35] amnesia
[1:12:37] to fight this disease this is a real
[1:12:40] disease that's spreading
[1:12:47] a man made a statement here a
[1:12:50] while ago kind of an outstanding
[1:12:52] statement he
[1:12:53] said the the message shouldn't be called
[1:12:56] the voice of god
[1:12:59] and i'm sure he was referring to a
[1:13:02] certain institution
[1:13:04] but brother branham said i am the voice
[1:13:06] of god to you
[1:13:09] the message was the voice of god
[1:13:13] it was you know what i mean but see the
[1:13:17] whole thing of these things
[1:13:19] is to come in and the side track is
[1:13:23] and to think on things and the scripture
[1:13:26] tells whichever so things are good
[1:13:28] think on these things
[1:13:32] because these are the things that fight
[1:13:34] us from getting in spiritual
[1:13:36] amnesia amen the other thing he said
[1:13:39] it's about know who you
[1:13:40] are and know that you're his disciples
[1:13:45] i like it it is in the gospel of saint
[1:13:49] john if you
[1:13:51] want to turn to it you feel free but
[1:13:53] it's the
[1:13:54] first john the fifth chapter
[1:13:58] and it says by this we know
[1:14:05] and we'll just read from the first verse
[1:14:07] just a few verses
[1:14:08] whosoever believeth that jesus is the
[1:14:12] christ
[1:14:13] is born of god and everyone that
[1:14:16] loveth him that begotteth
[1:14:20] love him also that is begotten
[1:14:24] of him by this we know that we love
[1:14:28] the children of god when we
[1:14:32] love god and keep his commandments
[1:14:38] for this is the love of god
[1:14:42] that we keep his commandments and his
[1:14:45] commandments
[1:14:46] are not grievous for whosoever is
[1:14:50] born of god overcometh the world
[1:14:53] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:14:57] the world
[1:14:58] even our faith so one of the ways that
[1:15:02] we know is we've got to know that we're
[1:15:05] his disciples
[1:15:08] and we know that we're his disciples
[1:15:10] because
[1:15:11] we keep his commandments
[1:15:14] so one of the ways to fight amnesia
[1:15:19] is to keep the commandments
[1:15:23] keep his commandments not only
[1:15:26] the 10 commandments but we know that
[1:15:30] again i mentioned communion you got to
[1:15:33] keep that ordinance
[1:15:36] you foot washing water baptism
[1:15:39] but there's a lot of other things he
[1:15:41] talked about visiting the widow and
[1:15:43] their
[1:15:44] affliction helping the fatherless
[1:15:48] uh going the extra mile
[1:15:52] you know all the things that are
[1:15:53] commandments of the lord
[1:15:55] heck have you ever spent time just
[1:15:57] thinking on the things
[1:15:59] god didn't leave us see we're too
[1:16:02] religious
[1:16:05] religion is a doorway for amnesia
[1:16:10] it moves everything into into
[1:16:13] religious belief and religious
[1:16:16] association and religious but none of
[1:16:20] the
[1:16:20] actual things that he said we do
[1:16:26] visit the sick
[1:16:29] all these things that are the
[1:16:32] commandments of god
[1:16:34] that that they're given for us to keep
[1:16:37] you know
[1:16:37] uh just little things like like
[1:16:40] uh uh go if a guy sues you for your
[1:16:46] coat give them your cloak also
[1:16:49] you know could lend and can
[1:16:52] to and not to be asked to uh
[1:16:56] be paid back i know a lot of people like
[1:17:00] that one
[1:17:02] i'm going to borrow and i'd have to pay
[1:17:04] back but
[1:17:05] you know do what's on your heart but
[1:17:08] that's to the lender
[1:17:12] it ain't to the borrower so don't
[1:17:14] misplace
[1:17:15] god's word
[1:17:19] and and there's all these great things
[1:17:23] that are the commandments of the lord
[1:17:26] and if you're going to fight
[1:17:28] amnesia because
[1:17:31] it is a disease that's trying to get on
[1:17:35] you
[1:17:37] i've got i i just saw it today i
[1:17:40] read it today he said it's a contagious
[1:17:44] disease that anybody can get
[1:17:48] so if you stick your head in the ground
[1:17:51] and say there's no such thing as amnesia
[1:17:54] i'm not forgetting anything
[1:17:58] you know and and we forget to give our
[1:18:01] church offerings
[1:18:02] we forget to pay our tithes we forget to
[1:18:06] look out
[1:18:07] after the well-being of others we forget
[1:18:10] to
[1:18:10] to to to be mindful
[1:18:14] to let this mind be in you that was in
[1:18:16] christ jesus
[1:18:17] that every man looks upon the things of
[1:18:20] other above his own thing
[1:18:22] if that's not happening
[1:18:25] then amnesia's coming in you may not be
[1:18:29] totally taken over yet
[1:18:32] but when amnesia reaches its full
[1:18:36] fledge uh manifestation
[1:18:40] the scripture says that you no longer
[1:18:43] wish to teach god in your thinking and
[1:18:46] you don't want
[1:18:46] anything spiritual in your life
[1:18:50] you have transformed from the spiritual
[1:18:53] mind to
[1:18:54] the carnal mind now we don't want to go
[1:18:57] there
[1:18:58] but you don't think that satan's like a
[1:19:00] roaring lion
[1:19:01] going about whom he may devour you say
[1:19:04] well what's he doing how's he devouring
[1:19:06] he's going about spreading this disease
[1:19:10] this virus called spiritual
[1:19:14] amnesia to get god's children
[1:19:18] to forget who they are
[1:19:21] to forget his commandments to forget
[1:19:24] to lay for themselves a pattern of good
[1:19:28] work
[1:19:28] ask yourself how many you don't have to
[1:19:30] raise your hand how many of you have a
[1:19:32] pattern of good works
[1:19:36] things a pattern is something that's
[1:19:38] repeated
[1:19:39] in your life something that you do
[1:19:42] for people over and over
[1:19:46] in your life you help people you have a
[1:19:49] work
[1:19:50] maybe it's just going by and saying a
[1:19:52] word of encouragement somebody
[1:19:54] checking out somebody it's not a
[1:19:56] one-time thing
[1:19:58] that something pops up and you do it
[1:20:01] because it popped up
[1:20:03] but you in your life
[1:20:07] have good works that you do
[1:20:12] you have a pattern of good works
[1:20:16] it doesn't have to be to the same person
[1:20:19] but maybe you you you whatever it might
[1:20:23] be
[1:20:24] it's something that you continually
[1:20:26] practice
[1:20:27] a good work the work is practiced
[1:20:31] doesn't have to be on the same person
[1:20:35] but you continually maybe give clothes
[1:20:38] to somebody
[1:20:39] you continually donate this food bank
[1:20:43] you continuously have a pattern of good
[1:20:46] work
[1:20:46] something in your life that you deep
[1:20:48] good you say why are you saying that
[1:20:50] because what we're talking about is
[1:20:52] things that keep you away
[1:20:55] from the disease if not
[1:20:59] you get all weary
[1:21:05] does that ring a bell what did you hear
[1:21:07] this morning
[1:21:09] weary causes amnesia
[1:21:15] he says it causes it you get down
[1:21:18] you get weary life's a burden
[1:21:22] and and it's hard and i'm struggling and
[1:21:28] pretty soon that eats you up
[1:21:30] and the more he can make life weary some
[1:21:34] the quicker you're forgetting about the
[1:21:37] god
[1:21:39] that's the creator and you forgot that
[1:21:43] jesus said
[1:21:44] the righteous won't beg bread
[1:21:47] that god's always on time he came right
[1:21:51] at the right time
[1:21:53] he's always right on time you think of
[1:21:56] daniel in the lion stand
[1:21:58] in went daniel but he stopped the
[1:22:02] mouths of the lion inn went shadrach
[1:22:04] meshach and abednego
[1:22:06] but he stopped they went in before the
[1:22:09] victory came
[1:22:11] but the victory was right on time
[1:22:14] that's the kind of god you serve so
[1:22:16] that's how we know that we
[1:22:19] we we we fight these things we lay for
[1:22:22] ourselves
[1:22:23] a pattern of good works
[1:22:26] uh we keep his commandments we go the
[1:22:29] extra mile we do the things that
[1:22:31] he said do we're mindful of the word of
[1:22:34] god
[1:22:36] the prophet of god says that every time
[1:22:38] the church doors are open that we ought
[1:22:40] to be there
[1:22:41] now i know there are circumstances
[1:22:45] but you can't have a pattern
[1:22:49] you know and i understand some people
[1:22:50] work on sunday
[1:22:52] i wish that our civilization
[1:22:55] hadn't developed a society
[1:23:00] that works you know when i first came to
[1:23:03] texas
[1:23:04] there was nothing open on sunday
[1:23:07] no grocery stores no nothing they opened
[1:23:11] up at noon
[1:23:13] can you imagine a world that respected
[1:23:16] church
[1:23:17] that much you think they have any
[1:23:21] respect for church now
[1:23:24] no shut them down
[1:23:28] we'll let ten of you go in there
[1:23:31] i don't know i'm in conflict
[1:23:35] because the word of god i read my bible
[1:23:37] the other day forsake not
[1:23:39] assembling yourselves together unless
[1:23:41] there's a c19 virus
[1:23:49] it doesn't say that i mean i read the
[1:23:52] scriptures and moses is the only guy
[1:23:54] that can lay hands on anybody
[1:23:56] because his arms are six feet long
[1:24:02] i mean what are you doing you understand
[1:24:05] things are coming straight up
[1:24:07] in conflict with the word of god and we
[1:24:10] try to ration
[1:24:11] out a reasoning who's a major reasoner
[1:24:15] in the scripture
[1:24:18] eve
[1:24:22] she went to reasoning
[1:24:26] i don't know i know what the scripture
[1:24:30] says
[1:24:32] the scripture says if we keep his
[1:24:34] commandments nothing will harm us
[1:24:36] we can take up a deadly thing and it
[1:24:39] won't
[1:24:39] harm us i just know what the word says
[1:24:43] do you understand but we with this
[1:24:46] amnesia's coming
[1:24:48] in to this fear
[1:24:52] remember he said if you knew that you
[1:24:54] were going to be shot in the morning
[1:24:56] what would you do i'd have faith
[1:25:00] why he says worry's only going to make
[1:25:02] it worse
[1:25:03] but if i have faith it might deliver me
[1:25:07] [Applause]
[1:25:10] it's sad when
[1:25:14] you have to tell people if you're sick
[1:25:16] stay home
[1:25:20] and here's jesus saying bring all you
[1:25:22] that are heavy laden and sick
[1:25:24] come unto me bring him in
[1:25:30] but if you forgot
[1:25:34] that this is the kind of god we have
[1:25:38] and we put more power
[1:25:41] in the disease than we do the creator
[1:25:45] right and i'm not talking a lot and i
[1:25:48] said this at the beginning the only
[1:25:50] reason we've taken some of the stances
[1:25:52] we can
[1:25:53] is for them
[1:25:57] i don't put on my mask because i'm
[1:25:58] afraid of going in the store
[1:26:01] i'll put on math for those that are
[1:26:06] afraid
[1:26:08] you know it's it's for them so
[1:26:11] you know i'll i'll bear the reproach
[1:26:14] i went in to see my locksmith you know i
[1:26:16] was thinking about buying a safe
[1:26:19] and he didn't have his mask on i said
[1:26:22] you don't have to put that mask on
[1:26:23] because of me
[1:26:24] he said you don't have to put your mask
[1:26:26] on because of me either
[1:26:28] i said oh my we're going to have a
[1:26:30] revival
[1:26:32] right here see what do you understand
[1:26:35] if you don't if if you don't bring
[1:26:39] the word of god in your remembrance
[1:26:42] you're going to let something
[1:26:43] else sell you a bill of goods
[1:26:47] and that brings me to the next thing i
[1:26:49] want to talk about
[1:26:51] is study to show yourself approved
[1:26:56] second timothy 2 and 15
[1:27:00] know the promises of god
[1:27:05] know what he promised you
[1:27:09] and i mean when i say study
[1:27:13] that means you take specific
[1:27:16] areas of
[1:27:19] the only word that comes to my mind is
[1:27:21] research
[1:27:23] but i'll put it this way
[1:27:28] seek and you shall find knock
[1:27:31] and it shall be open study
[1:27:34] what protections do you have in the word
[1:27:36] of god what
[1:27:38] promises did he make to you
[1:27:44] you know what what what what are the
[1:27:46] things that
[1:27:47] he promised us we need to study we need
[1:27:50] to know his promises
[1:27:54] we need to know that he'll throw our
[1:27:56] mistakes in the sea of
[1:27:58] his forgetfulness to be remembered no
[1:28:01] more
[1:28:02] we've got to know when we confess our
[1:28:04] faults
[1:28:05] and we confess our sins that he's
[1:28:08] faithful
[1:28:09] and just to forgive them
[1:28:12] and with god forgive means
[1:28:16] forget
[1:28:20] we have a hard time doing that because
[1:28:22] of this carnal
[1:28:24] census but
[1:28:27] if we could just study
[1:28:32] you're not going to get resist this
[1:28:35] spirit
[1:28:36] just coming to church on sunday if karen
[1:28:38] a minister just preached what's on his
[1:28:40] heart for an hour and a half
[1:28:42] two hours and
[1:28:45] and not have any more studying going on
[1:28:47] in your life
[1:28:50] one of the commandments we have is read
[1:28:52] our bible and pray
[1:28:53] in other words look at it this way not
[1:28:55] read your bible
[1:28:56] anybody can read but read with
[1:29:00] revelation
[1:29:01] read with study greed to
[1:29:04] that we might increase in the knowledge
[1:29:07] of his will
[1:29:08] and that we might know what the
[1:29:10] scripture says what his
[1:29:12] might is towards us
[1:29:17] i used to be able to give you the
[1:29:18] chapter and verse of that
[1:29:21] but it's in there maybe maybe it's
[1:29:24] crossed one of your minds
[1:29:27] you know you know or he he talks about
[1:29:29] that that you're that you might increase
[1:29:31] in the knowledge
[1:29:32] and might learn his might towards us
[1:29:35] that's what we've got to study how are
[1:29:37] we going to fight this disease
[1:29:41] because it's after us
[1:29:45] it wants to take our god out of our mind
[1:29:49] it wants to take our god out of our
[1:29:52] thinking
[1:29:54] he's fine if you can just have this god
[1:29:57] on sunday
[1:29:58] isn't that enough that was pharaoh
[1:30:03] go off and on sundays
[1:30:07] and worship and then when you're done
[1:30:09] come on back and build bricks
[1:30:12] is anybody tired of building satan's
[1:30:14] eden
[1:30:18] if anybody tired of being under the task
[1:30:21] master
[1:30:22] of this world you know
[1:30:26] this ain't our home i'm a justice
[1:30:30] traveling through
[1:30:33] i i remember that i've studied to show
[1:30:36] myself
[1:30:36] approved they're not going to work me
[1:30:38] forever
[1:30:40] you know what i mean and they're not
[1:30:43] going to bury me in the ground
[1:30:46] they might throw this carcass but i'll
[1:30:48] tell you something i've got a new one
[1:30:50] waiting
[1:30:53] amen you know
[1:30:56] and and on that other side i might be
[1:30:58] handsome
[1:31:01] everybody just judges you by a worldly
[1:31:04] standard
[1:31:05] everybody in heaven is going to have big
[1:31:07] noses
[1:31:09] hallelujah
[1:31:13] oh no a carnal mind is what
[1:31:16] enemy against god is it it sets you
[1:31:20] apart from god
[1:31:22] and if once you get apart from god satan
[1:31:25] can start
[1:31:26] taking things out of your memory he
[1:31:28] takes them out of your memory
[1:31:30] one by one
[1:31:33] the little foxes spoil the vine a little
[1:31:37] bit he robs you
[1:31:38] he takes you he makes you forget all
[1:31:41] that he's done for you
[1:31:44] he makes you forget you know yeah we
[1:31:47] we need to a study to know the promises
[1:31:53] just say ask yourself how many promises
[1:31:56] do you know
[1:31:58] that god's made to you
[1:32:01] that you've memorized them they're part
[1:32:04] of your life
[1:32:07] i'll tell you a promise that i quote all
[1:32:09] the time in my heart
[1:32:11] he who started a good work in you will
[1:32:14] finish it till the end
[1:32:18] i have not chosen him he hath chosen me
[1:32:22] amen i just remind myself of that and
[1:32:26] remind myself
[1:32:27] because if i don't remind myself of that
[1:32:30] satan's going to try to point out what a
[1:32:32] failure
[1:32:33] i am and praise god
[1:32:37] he saved the failure
[1:32:43] yeah that's why we build ourselves in a
[1:32:45] statue of a perfect man
[1:32:47] because a man who doesn't have these
[1:32:49] things cannot see afar off
[1:32:51] and has forgotten he's got spiritual
[1:32:54] amnesia so we got to know the promises
[1:32:58] of god
[1:32:58] we've got to know what power
[1:33:02] has been commissioned to us
[1:33:05] the works that i do you shall do also
[1:33:10] and and that brings me to the last thing
[1:33:14] that i want to say that
[1:33:18] is very important
[1:33:21] and that's to keep the commission
[1:33:27] and that also comes under keeping his
[1:33:30] commandments
[1:33:32] and he commissioned us to go into all
[1:33:35] the world
[1:33:36] that commission got destroyed
[1:33:41] when satan established nickelodeonism
[1:33:47] and made the five-fold ministry offices
[1:33:50] in the carnal church instead of gifts
[1:33:54] in the believer
[1:33:59] believe me sisters you can testify
[1:34:04] there's lots of circumstances and lots
[1:34:07] of situations
[1:34:08] that i would feel extremely
[1:34:11] uncomfortable
[1:34:12] in that you can stand there
[1:34:16] in that gap and make a difference
[1:34:19] in somebody's life so
[1:34:23] you you've got to carry out the
[1:34:24] commission and therefore
[1:34:27] one of the greatest things that we have
[1:34:31] to fight spiritual amnesia
[1:34:34] is testifying
[1:34:37] testify don't let what he's done
[1:34:42] go unnoticed god does things for
[1:34:46] us and and you rejoice but you never
[1:34:49] share them you don't share all the
[1:34:52] things that god's done for you you don't
[1:34:54] share it
[1:34:55] you know and i'm just not talking about
[1:34:57] a testimony service at church
[1:34:59] you ought to tell people that you come
[1:35:01] and contact
[1:35:02] god did it for me if somebody opens the
[1:35:05] door you can say you know i used to be
[1:35:06] like that but god
[1:35:09] but god and testify
[1:35:12] because you've got to keep the works and
[1:35:15] the love of god
[1:35:16] alive else they'll be forgotten
[1:35:23] they'll be forgotten all the things
[1:35:25] that's god's done
[1:35:27] for us
[1:35:30] i don't want them to be forgotten
[1:35:35] you know i i like to talk to
[1:35:38] adrian and and and cosmine and i i
[1:35:42] i'd like to have them give me their
[1:35:43] testimony of how that they came
[1:35:48] from their country and how that they got
[1:35:51] over here and the way god opened the
[1:35:52] door for him and
[1:35:54] all these great things i love to hear
[1:35:56] those things
[1:35:57] i love testimonies because i know that
[1:35:59] god's still doing
[1:36:00] god's done some remarkable things for
[1:36:03] people
[1:36:04] remarkable
[1:36:08] all right brother matt testify i used to
[1:36:10] be an atheist
[1:36:13] well what changed that you think one day
[1:36:16] he decided that he didn't want to be an
[1:36:18] atheist no more
[1:36:19] he thought he'd try christianity for a
[1:36:22] while no
[1:36:23] god put his hand on him
[1:36:26] i don't want to embarrass him and
[1:36:27] everything but you know
[1:36:30] you know i'm going to tell it you can
[1:36:32] get mad at me later but heidi went and
[1:36:34] got him out of jail one time you know
[1:36:36] that's that's how the things that god
[1:36:38] did
[1:36:39] i've seen their testimony
[1:36:43] what is that it's the hand of god
[1:36:47] in two people's lives with transforming
[1:36:50] power
[1:36:51] why do we keep that in the lid
[1:36:56] brother billy paul tells the testimony
[1:36:59] of he's sitting in this barber shop
[1:37:02] and this barber's cutting his hair and
[1:37:04] all of a sudden his
[1:37:06] the barber pulled out the man sent from
[1:37:08] god book
[1:37:11] and said this is your dad
[1:37:18] he said if that was my dad i'd tell the
[1:37:20] whole world
[1:37:24] if this is my god i'll tell the whole
[1:37:27] world
[1:37:28] you know why he doesn't want you to
[1:37:30] testify
[1:37:31] because he wants you to
[1:37:34] forget
[1:37:39] that is the thing that hurts the lord
[1:37:42] more than anything is when his children
[1:37:46] forget what he's done
[1:37:48] for him you want to fight
[1:37:52] amnesia and you want to recover
[1:37:56] from amnesia maybe satan got you in the
[1:37:59] case and you backslid and you're away
[1:38:01] from god
[1:38:02] if you will go back and do the things
[1:38:04] that he says to do
[1:38:06] you will recover
[1:38:10] and you will remember that he said i
[1:38:13] will not leave you
[1:38:14] nor forsake you but i'll be with you
[1:38:17] even
[1:38:18] till the end and i'll lead you in the
[1:38:21] paths of righteousness
[1:38:22] how many have got off the path of
[1:38:24] righteousness in their life
[1:38:26] and you find out he leads you right back
[1:38:31] amen he's a shepherd he leaves the 99
[1:38:35] to go after the one you understand i
[1:38:38] just want to tell you is that you're not
[1:38:40] going to fight this disease
[1:38:41] unless you fight this disease
[1:38:47] if you don't fight it you're going to
[1:38:48] get it
[1:38:52] amen i know it's pretty simple
[1:38:57] but it's real
[1:39:00] and we see the effects of it
[1:39:04] all over the place and the only thing we
[1:39:06] can do
[1:39:07] is take our weapon
[1:39:11] and fight back right
[1:39:15] resist the devil
[1:39:19] and he will flee it never said
[1:39:22] hope the devil will leave you alone
[1:39:26] because he won't but this word
[1:39:29] will defeat him any place anytime
[1:39:33] under any circumstance so let's
[1:39:37] fight spiritual amnesia and if you're
[1:39:41] fighting spiritual media you're studying
[1:39:44] you're testifying you're doing laying
[1:39:46] for yourself a pattern of good works
[1:39:48] then you become a front-line worker to
[1:39:53] deliver other people
[1:39:56] who have this spiritual amnesia
[1:40:00] and people will all of a sudden remember
[1:40:02] god loves me
[1:40:05] and you say you know i was really down
[1:40:07] but god took care of me
[1:40:09] god just made this happen the lord make
[1:40:11] a way
[1:40:12] he's a waymaker and you just start
[1:40:15] testifying
[1:40:16] and you bring god alive and satan hates
[1:40:19] that
[1:40:21] when they threw peter in jail and they
[1:40:22] said okay you can go
[1:40:24] they scourged him and they said now
[1:40:25] don't you testify in the
[1:40:27] in this name no more he said what is it
[1:40:31] better
[1:40:33] for me to believe you or to obey god
[1:40:39] amen the gates of hell
[1:40:44] will prevail against this
[1:40:48] revelation
[1:40:50] but praise god i'm gonna i'm gonna
