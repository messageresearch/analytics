[6:02] um
[6:06] good morning i just want to make a
[6:08] couple announcements before we started
[6:11] service
[6:12] it's going to be really really long
[6:14] today so anybody that wants to leave can
[6:17] good again no it's not
[6:20] we're going to play 11 minutes of tape
[6:23] and it'll probably take us three weeks
[6:25] to get through those 11 minutes but
[6:28] anyway
[6:29] as you know as pastor that
[6:32] we have we wear many different hats and
[6:35] we have many different roles
[6:38] we're the spiritual director of course
[6:40] of the church we're the
[6:42] music director
[6:44] we're the chief financial officer
[6:48] and we're also the chief of police
[6:52] and so today i want to talk to you about
[6:57] a traffic problem
[7:00] as chief of police we have a traffic our
[7:02] problem
[7:04] and so
[7:05] what's happening is
[7:08] uh i don't understand this exactly
[7:11] but it i guess it's the interpretation
[7:14] of church language
[7:16] and so in church language when we invite
[7:20] the musicians
[7:22] somehow that's interpreted it's time to
[7:24] go to the bathroom
[7:27] so what we have is we have the musicians
[7:31] coming this way
[7:33] and everybody that wants to go to the
[7:35] bathroom
[7:36] going that way
[7:38] at the same time
[7:40] and as you know that are
[7:43] our aisles and things in the church are
[7:46] all set up one way
[7:48] you're either coming in or you're going
[7:50] out
[7:51] that's sort of like the gospel you know
[7:53] what i mean
[7:54] and
[7:56] so we need to we need to
[8:02] also realize that usually at the end of
[8:05] the service when they're going to start
[8:07] playing the music and the musicians come
[8:11] you know that's the time
[8:13] the holy spirit is dealing with hearts
[8:16] he waits till after the word and then he
[8:19] comes down and starts convicting and
[8:22] working on hearts now i don't really
[8:24] know if everybody has to go to the
[8:26] bathroom or they're just running from
[8:28] the conviction
[8:30] and the presence of the lord
[8:33] either way it
[8:35] it's causing
[8:37] this
[8:39] traffic problem
[8:41] that we're having you know so you and if
[8:44] you notice the aisles are rather small
[8:47] and i know that all of us are very thin
[8:49] and
[8:50] uh
[8:51] people
[8:52] so but because still some of us it's
[8:54] hard to cross
[8:55] in such a narrow space so
[8:58] before that you want to leave out from
[9:01] under the conviction of the holy spirit
[9:04] please let the
[9:06] musicians all take their place
[9:09] and all start playing
[9:11] and then you can slip out
[9:13] and and go to the restroom or whatever
[9:16] that you want
[9:17] are doing
[9:19] uh so we we we want to kind of make that
[9:23] understand also to help
[9:25] with the uh
[9:28] the
[9:29] traffic thing
[9:30] to the best of your ability
[9:33] if the musicians could sit on the side
[9:36] of the instrument
[9:38] that they play
[9:39] and then we don't have the crossing
[9:42] over so sometimes we'll have musicians
[9:45] that play these instruments sitting on
[9:47] this side
[9:48] and put musicians that play
[9:51] these instruments
[9:52] and so they're going this way
[9:55] and people are going that way and people
[9:57] are going this way
[9:59] and it's
[10:02] you know
[10:03] and i'm sitting here going
[10:05] you know or who's ever here so we can
[10:08] fix that easy right
[10:10] everybody has that so
[10:11] that's an announcement as a chief of
[10:14] police
[10:16] also now as music director
[10:20] another hat that we
[10:22] wear
[10:23] we are uh we have many people that
[10:26] desire to play
[10:28] an instrument
[10:30] and so uh
[10:32] we're gonna rotate musicians
[10:34] periodically
[10:36] so nobody feel like
[10:38] uh this is my spot
[10:41] and i'm the
[10:44] this
[10:45] i'm the trumpet player or i'm the
[10:48] tuba player you know what i mean we
[10:51] don't have first chair
[10:53] you know what i mean that's uh
[10:55] anybody that's ever played music how
[10:57] many knows what first chair means all
[11:00] right so that means you're the top chair
[11:03] you're number one but we don't have that
[11:06] we don't go by talent
[11:08] we go by people that feel led
[11:10] of the lord to serve the lord so
[11:14] we certainly want to
[11:18] let you know that if you have a hearts
[11:20] desire to play instrument we will try to
[11:23] work you in periodically and then we
[11:26] have some people that would will only
[11:28] play when there's nobody else
[11:31] and so we're grateful for that so we
[11:34] just want to let you know a few of those
[11:35] things uh i didn't want to do it
[11:38] during the service so i just thought i'd
[11:40] take a moment so help us with that
[11:44] if you can and
[11:46] so again just always wait until the
[11:49] musicians are are all seated and played
[11:53] playing before you have to leave the
[11:57] sanctuary and then also be very
[12:00] sensitive
[12:01] to the holy spirit if the holy spirit's
[12:04] moving
[12:05] and because you never know the best
[12:08] thing that could ever happen is someone
[12:09] to come under conviction
[12:12] and realize they need the lord
[12:14] and
[12:15] and surely we don't want to have
[12:18] somebody that god's dealing with and
[12:20] then somebody pushing by him saying
[12:23] you know i just go just
[12:25] sensitive to the holy spirit
[12:27] sensitive to what's happening in the
[12:30] sanctuary let every let all the
[12:32] musicians make their way to the
[12:34] instruments
[12:35] and then as uh if you really are in that
[12:40] situation
[12:41] uh
[12:42] you know we always had a
[12:45] saying around you know and i hope i that
[12:48] this
[12:49] say this is
[12:50] not your revenue in any way
[12:53] but we always had a saying go before you
[12:55] go
[12:59] you know what i mean and so
[13:03] you know i know that so you know
[13:07] you can do it so anyway we just wanted
[13:10] to take care of that just makes it help
[13:12] in the meetings when we had so many
[13:14] people here it was really
[13:16] hard
[13:17] but
[13:18] it's still difficult with what we have
[13:21] so lord bless you and just be in prayer
[13:23] we won't be long this morning it's nice
[13:26] to see every everybody here
[13:29] there's a little baby dedication coming

[13:46] and just have a wonderful time in the

[24:52] amen
[25:13] morning
[25:15] i'm going to
[25:17] read psalm 57 this morning
[25:21] and uh
[25:24] you know that little note might be in
[25:25] your bible as it is in mind kind of the
[25:27] beginning of the chapter there's a
[25:28] little note there that says that this
[25:30] was something that david wrote
[25:33] when he fled from saul
[25:36] in the cave
[25:39] and you know you know
[25:41] you know the story
[25:43] david was really nothing he was a
[25:46] shepherd boy the
[25:48] youngest of all the littlest of of of a
[25:51] lowly family
[25:54] and uh one day
[25:57] he was running errands for an army that
[25:59] he could not qualify for
[26:02] and ended up defeating an enemy that the
[26:05] biggest man in the camp was afraid of
[26:10] and very quickly he became public enemy
[26:12] number one
[26:14] for the king
[26:17] you know he found himself on the run
[26:20] for years he
[26:22] went from place to place in the
[26:24] wilderness
[26:25] going from a cave here to a stronghold
[26:28] here to a mountain here
[26:31] you know and saul poured
[26:33] everything he had into scouring the land
[26:36] trying to find him
[26:40] he was so obsessed
[26:42] with this one individual
[26:44] that he used his entire army
[26:48] and scoured every inch of the land
[26:52] and
[26:54] it got to the point where he began
[26:55] threatening his own people
[26:58] you know
[26:59] if they were to help him
[27:01] he killed all the priests
[27:04] in one town alone
[27:08] all because saul was afraid of losing
[27:11] his position
[27:14] you know here he was
[27:16] committing everything he had
[27:19] to find this one little man
[27:23] you know is it a desperate act to
[27:25] protect his position and try to keep the
[27:27] word of god from being made manifest
[27:30] because a word had been spoken over
[27:32] david you know it's amazing the lengths
[27:35] that men will go to
[27:38] to protect their little kingdoms
[27:42] even in the face of thus saith the lord
[27:46] it says in first samuel 23 14 it says in
[27:49] david abode in the wilderness
[27:52] in strongholds
[27:53] and remained in a mountain in the
[27:55] wilderness of zif
[27:57] and saul sought him every day
[28:01] but god delivered him not
[28:04] into his hand
[28:07] what's amazing is
[28:10] he used his entire reign
[28:12] his entire reign became about chasing
[28:15] this one man
[28:18] with all that effort god never delivered
[28:21] him into his hand
[28:24] you know think of that
[28:27] you know to me that's kind of you know
[28:30] he had all the resources at his disposal
[28:32] he was a king
[28:34] he had an entire kingdom
[28:36] and he still couldn't get him
[28:40] you know we live in a similar hour
[28:44] you know there's an enemy out there
[28:47] that's putting all his focus
[28:50] on one little group
[28:54] and why is that because he knows that
[28:56] one day there will be a people that will
[28:58] dispossess him of his kingdom
[29:03] you know and in his desperate
[29:06] final hours
[29:08] he is in the process of utilizing every
[29:11] resource in his kingdom
[29:14] to scour the earth
[29:17] to lay hold of you
[29:20] and keep you from dispossessing him of
[29:22] his kingdom
[29:26] but though the enemy sought him every
[29:28] day
[29:30] god delivered him not
[29:32] into his hand
[29:36] you know the first verse of psalm 57
[29:38] says this it says be merciful unto me o
[29:41] god
[29:42] be merciful unto me yea in the shadow of
[29:46] thy wings
[29:47] will i make my refuge
[29:50] until these calamities be overpassed
[29:55] you know while david might have been
[29:57] hiding
[29:58] temporarily in caves or
[30:00] mountains or strongholds
[30:03] where his real refuge was
[30:06] was not in the cave
[30:08] wasn't in the stronghold
[30:10] it was in the shadow of his wings
[30:14] you know but the portion of the verse
[30:15] that caught my attention here was that
[30:18] phrase
[30:19] until these calamities be
[30:22] overpassed
[30:26] you know that could be
[30:27] true for anyone who finds themselves in
[30:29] the shadow of his wings
[30:32] you know it doesn't mean that calamities
[30:34] aren't going to come
[30:36] you know it doesn't mean that
[30:38] there won't be any trouble but what it
[30:40] means is they will pass over
[30:43] until they be over
[30:45] passed
[30:48] you know in spite of the fact that
[30:49] there's an enemy the ruler of a kingdom
[30:51] who can throw every resource at one
[30:55] little individual
[30:57] to try to
[30:59] make him his singular focus
[31:03] the calamities wouldn't be the end of
[31:05] him that some point
[31:07] they would overpass
[31:10] those that are in the shadow of his
[31:12] wings see the backside of the calamity
[31:18] you know that phrase to be overpassed is
[31:21] only used twice in the entire bible the
[31:23] second time is in isaiah 26 20 it says
[31:27] come my people enter thou into thy
[31:30] chambers and shut thy doors about thee
[31:34] hide thyself as it were for a little
[31:36] moment
[31:38] until
[31:39] the indignation be overpassed
[31:42] that verse is to my
[31:44] people
[31:46] you know
[31:48] how you know it occurred to me they're
[31:49] just reading all this that
[31:52] once again david didn't find his refuge
[31:54] in the mountains or the strongholds or
[31:56] the caves
[31:57] he found that refuge in the shadow of
[31:59] his ring
[32:00] wings and it was there that he saw the
[32:02] trouble overpass but as i was reading
[32:04] that it began to wonder
[32:06] you know especially if we see the events
[32:08] of this past week
[32:09] how often we set up for ourselves caves
[32:13] and strongholds
[32:15] and mountains
[32:16] to be our refuge
[32:19] instead of relying
[32:21] on the shadow of his wings
[32:24] how often we set up little temporary
[32:26] caves little temporary strongholds
[32:30] you know and if the situation of this
[32:32] week has shown us anything it's that
[32:34] everything can change in a day
[32:38] in one moment people can be living their
[32:41] lives secure in whatever
[32:43] refuge they've set for themselves and
[32:46] the very next day
[32:47] every one of those refuges taken away
[32:53] you know it's a sobering moment a time
[32:54] to remember that everything that can be
[32:56] shaken
[32:57] will be shaken
[33:00] but it's important
[33:02] also that when you see these things
[33:04] become the past
[33:05] your redemption draws nigh
[33:09] and it just was a reminder to me that
[33:11] you know whether
[33:13] that cave that we set up for ourselves
[33:16] is our our house
[33:18] our career
[33:20] our job
[33:22] the government
[33:24] whether that mountain that you set up is
[33:26] your family
[33:28] your health or your abilities
[33:31] your finances or
[33:33] even your church
[33:36] sooner or later the enemy sought david
[33:38] in every single refuge that he set for
[33:41] himself
[33:42] sooner or later the enemy is coming for
[33:44] every one of those refuges
[33:46] and the only refuge that you can rely on
[33:49] is the shadow of his wings
[33:54] david goes on to say in verse 2 i will
[33:56] cry unto god most high
[33:58] unto god that performeth
[34:01] all things
[34:03] for me
[34:06] just as his enemy was using every
[34:09] resource at his disposal
[34:11] to try to lay hold of him
[34:14] god was using every resource at his
[34:17] disposal
[34:18] to keep him
[34:20] and he delivered him not
[34:22] into his hand there's one that has every
[34:25] resource at his disposal
[34:28] you know to me psalm
[34:30] 57
[34:32] is just a wonderful reminder that we
[34:34] take care of what we set up for
[34:36] ourselves as a refuge
[34:38] and we
[34:39] instead seek that place
[34:42] in the shadow of his wings where true
[34:44] refuge lies you know as for moses
[34:47] there's a place by me
[34:50] and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[34:53] and it shall come to pass when my glory
[34:55] passeth by
[34:57] that i will put thee in a cliff of the
[34:59] rock
[35:01] and will cover thee with my hand
[35:04] while i pass by
[35:06] over past
[35:09] standing upon the rock as being in the
[35:11] shadow of his wings
[35:13] so just that's just what stuck out to me
[35:15] as i was reading this and let's just
[35:17] kind of read this short little psalm
[35:18] together as a reminder
[35:21] that we find ourselves in the one true
[35:23] refuge
[35:25] starting in verse 1 be merciful unto me
[35:28] o god be merciful unto me for my soul
[35:32] trusteth in thee
[35:33] yea in the shadow of thy wings will i
[35:36] make my refuge until these calamities be
[35:39] overpassed
[35:40] i will cry unto god most high unto god
[35:43] that performeth all things for me
[35:46] he shall send from heaven and save me
[35:48] from the reproach of him that would
[35:50] swallow me up sila
[35:53] god shall send forth his mercy and his
[35:55] truth
[35:56] my soul is among lions and i lie even
[35:59] among them that are set on fire even the
[36:02] sons of men whose teeth are spears and
[36:05] arrows and their tongue a sharp sword
[36:08] be thou exalted o god above the heavens
[36:11] let thy glory be above all the earth
[36:14] they have prepared a net for my steps my
[36:17] soul is bowed down they have digged a
[36:19] pit before me into the midst thereof
[36:22] they are fallen themselves selah
[36:24] my heart is fixed o god my heart is
[36:27] fixed i will sing and give praise awake
[36:31] up my glory awake sultry and harp i
[36:34] myself will awake early i will praise
[36:37] thee o lord among the people i will sing
[36:40] unto thee among the nations for thy
[36:42] mercy is great unto the heavens and thy
[36:45] truth unto the clouds be thou exalted o
[36:48] god above the heavens let thy glory be
[36:51] above all the earth amen

[58:39] not smarter than anybody you haven't
[58:42] done anything better
[58:45] in fact
[58:46] the pharisees had greater works
[58:49] but you're chosen
[58:51] and i can't explain it
[58:55] but he did it
[58:57] he didn't have to
[58:59] but he did
[59:00] amen we have a a little uh
[59:04] baby dedication
[59:06] and we were doing a lot of these
[59:10] lords really uh filling up the quiver
[59:13] and uh so we're really grateful but this
[59:17] morning
[59:19] we're going to dedicate
[59:22] jackson peter yeske
[59:24] and of course
[59:26] i like to have make it a family affair
[59:30] so
[59:31] i want to invite grandmas and grandpas
[59:35] and brother nathan and casey up
[59:38] with their beautiful
[59:40] new son to come on up let's sing this as
[59:42] they come in
[59:44] oh bring
[59:45] [Music]
[59:54] [Music]
[59:58] oh
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:17] oh
[1:00:18] hi you guys do a good job
[1:00:21] god bless you
[1:00:23] grandparents come up
[1:00:26] great grandma
[1:00:28] sorry
[1:00:30] you know that's how it is
[1:00:33] daniel the wonderful to have the
[1:00:35] yesterday's the hux family with us
[1:00:38] everybody and
[1:00:40] i don't know if i can hold this one or
[1:00:42] not there we go
[1:00:46] oh okay is ken out there great great
[1:00:49] grandpa do you want to come up ken
[1:00:51] all right there he is i didn't know he
[1:00:53] was
[1:00:54] another great
[1:00:56] grandpa here
[1:01:00] god bless you brother good to see you
[1:01:03] i didn't see you out there i'm doing
[1:01:05] well thank you me too good good i'm glad
[1:01:08] to hear it we're still making it aren't
[1:01:10] we that's right we're fighting up i like
[1:01:13] dedicating families
[1:01:15] because it takes a family to raise a
[1:01:17] child
[1:01:19] every portion of this child's life is
[1:01:22] affected
[1:01:23] by the great grandparents by the
[1:01:25] grandparents and by the parents
[1:01:28] and the more they're surrounded with the
[1:01:30] word of god
[1:01:32] and the love and the fellowship
[1:01:34] the more that child has a place to have
[1:01:38] hope
[1:01:39] and that's why there's so much
[1:01:41] trouble in the world today because
[1:01:42] there's so many broken homes
[1:01:45] and and so lack of tutoring
[1:01:48] and mentoring
[1:01:50] and just kind words of instruction and
[1:01:53] encouragement
[1:01:54] and so we're just not indebted giving
[1:01:56] this baby back to the lord
[1:01:58] but the lord is placing this child
[1:02:01] in a family
[1:02:03] in a surrounding and it takes everybody
[1:02:06] love and if the family doesn't love one
[1:02:08] another it's it's a bad environment so
[1:02:11] that's why we bring everybody here
[1:02:12] together
[1:02:14] and we have that way of doing it may i
[1:02:16] try to hold him
[1:02:19] why this scares me sometimes
[1:02:28] handsome fella huh
[1:02:30] hey man
[1:02:34] right
[1:02:35] i'm going to try to hold him here and i
[1:02:37] i have a little scripture when i heard
[1:02:39] his name
[1:02:40] uh jackson peter i i thought of this
[1:02:43] scripture and it came being it's in
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:47] fourth uh chapter in the book of acts it
[1:02:50] says and now when they saw the boldness
[1:02:53] of peter and john
[1:02:55] and perceived they were unlearned and
[1:02:59] ignorant men they marveled
[1:03:01] and took knowledge of them
[1:03:04] that they had been with jesus
[1:03:08] amen and that's what our hearts desire
[1:03:10] is for him today i'm going to give them
[1:03:13] back
[1:03:14] and i'm going to ask you to pray over
[1:03:16] them
[1:03:17] and then we will pray over them the
[1:03:19] grandpas and authors will all pray over
[1:03:21] them so if you dedicate your son to the
[1:03:24] lord
[1:03:26] yeah you can give a testimony so we're
[1:03:28] all about testimony
[1:03:31] so elena had uh pku
[1:03:34] and uh
[1:03:35] she doesn't want to have protein
[1:03:39] but uh she can have proteins go ahead
[1:03:41] and speak under the mic okay
[1:03:44] but elena had uh they said pku she
[1:03:47] wasn't allowed to have in protein

[1:06:28] this morning and
[1:06:30] we'll
[1:06:32] read a scripture
[1:06:34] and
[1:06:35] as you know that we're
[1:06:39] we're continuing on a uh
[1:06:46] then i i
[1:06:48] had this
[1:06:50] see if i can find this
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:54] statement here this morning
[1:07:00] i don't know how to find these things
[1:07:02] but
[1:07:04] some of the other brothers might help me
[1:07:06] find it but
[1:07:14] i believe it's right here
[1:07:17] and i thought this was tremendous
[1:07:19] statement
[1:07:20] it says
[1:07:21] you remember church
[1:07:24] that you're living in
[1:07:26] the best days
[1:07:28] that
[1:07:29] you've ever will live in
[1:07:32] right now
[1:07:34] this is 1951.
[1:07:37] brother branham's telling the church
[1:07:39] you're living in the best days
[1:07:44] that you're ever going to live in now
[1:07:47] and this was in 1951.
[1:07:50] now until jesus comes it shall gradually
[1:07:54] not gradually
[1:07:56] but rapidly get worse and worse
[1:08:01] when russia goes down there to get that
[1:08:04] oil
[1:08:05] look out
[1:08:07] now many times people think that that
[1:08:09] means that he wants oil wells
[1:08:12] and oil fields don't get that mistaken
[1:08:16] really what
[1:08:17] they want is the oil market
[1:08:20] where the money is
[1:08:22] and they supply millions of barrels of
[1:08:25] oil 40 percent of all europe's oil
[1:08:29] comes from
[1:08:30] russia
[1:08:31] now if he could cause an incursion
[1:08:34] and drive the price of oil up
[1:08:39] a hundred percent or 200 percent
[1:08:43] higher just think of all the billions of
[1:08:45] dollars
[1:08:46] that they'll rake in
[1:08:51] doesn't matter it's all about what
[1:08:54] the root of the love of money is the
[1:08:57] root of all
[1:09:00] evil but if you just look as we read
[1:09:02] this statement
[1:09:04] he says when russia goes down there to
[1:09:07] get that oil look out
[1:09:09] that's all she needs
[1:09:11] that's what the prophet said it would do
[1:09:15] and we're ready
[1:09:17] for it then so church get ready to meet
[1:09:20] christ
[1:09:22] he's sending great revivals in meetings
[1:09:25] and stirring the full gospel people
[1:09:27] signs and wonders appearing everywhere
[1:09:30] great wonders to draw his people
[1:09:32] together
[1:09:34] for one day he shall come
[1:09:37] the deliverer
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:40] are you looking for us coming
[1:09:42] what other sign i mean we've seen the
[1:09:45] lady in blue we've seen the mask people
[1:09:48] going in their houses wearing masks how
[1:09:50] many things have we seen
[1:09:52] that the prophet of god has
[1:09:55] placed
[1:09:56] and they're all hid
[1:09:59] in
[1:10:00] hundreds of statements all hid in
[1:10:02] simplicity all throughout the gospel and
[1:10:06] all of a sudden they just start coming
[1:10:07] out they've been there all the time so
[1:10:11] i just thought that was tremendous i got
[1:10:13] other quotes about russia you noticed
[1:10:16] every time brother brown was talking
[1:10:18] about russia everybody was thinking
[1:10:20] soviet union soviet union soviet union
[1:10:23] there's no such thing as russia it's
[1:10:25] because soviet now what is it
[1:10:28] just like he said it would be
[1:10:30] russia russia russia

[1:11:14] this morning
[1:11:15] and we're just having bible school this
[1:11:17] morning bible study
[1:11:19] rejoicing on the word of the lord and
[1:11:22] just being thankful for all this
[1:11:23] goodness to us as we're studying the
[1:11:26] wonderful message
[1:11:27] it is the rising of the sun
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:32] so
[1:11:33] we want to just read this to you
[1:11:36] here
[1:11:37] this morning in the book of acts the
[1:11:39] fourth
[1:11:41] chapter and you'll see the significance
[1:11:43] of this verse
[1:11:45] when we start into our study
[1:11:48] it says and being assembled together
[1:11:51] with them
[1:11:52] commanded
[1:11:54] them
[1:11:55] that they should not depart from
[1:11:58] jerusalem
[1:12:00] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:12:05] which
[1:12:06] said he ye have heard of me
[1:12:10] so he said
[1:12:12] you stay in jerusalem
[1:12:15] until you receive the promise of the
[1:12:17] father that i told you about
[1:12:20] for john truly baptized with water
[1:12:24] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[1:12:27] ghost
[1:12:28] not many
[1:12:29] days hence heavenly father we ask you to
[1:12:33] add your blessing to the word of the
[1:12:34] lord in jesus precious name we pray amen
[1:12:39] you may be seated
[1:12:48] you know we just had a a wonderful
[1:12:50] meeting here and they invited the young
[1:12:52] people and the
[1:12:54] lord certainly um met with us
[1:12:57] but you know we don't want to be what we
[1:12:59] call
[1:13:00] you know kind of campfire
[1:13:02] christians
[1:13:03] that when you have a camp meeting and
[1:13:05] the fires are going and everybody's
[1:13:07] excited and everything they have a
[1:13:10] wonderful time and then just a few days
[1:13:13] after that and
[1:13:14] every the camps dispersed and and
[1:13:17] everybody enters back into the gra the
[1:13:20] grind of life and they lose their
[1:13:22] victory
[1:13:24] and we don't want to do that we want to
[1:13:26] understand that we have victory every
[1:13:29] day of our lives that that uh it's it's
[1:13:34] just not that time that uh we would uh
[1:13:38] be away uh from a victory but we have a
[1:13:42] a great uh big victory is life
[1:13:46] daily
[1:13:47] now we've been reading this message and
[1:13:50] we've been studying it and we we talked
[1:13:52] about
[1:13:53] the last time that
[1:13:55] we talked about it was that
[1:13:58] we are the benefactors
[1:14:02] that this great resurrection the the
[1:14:05] lord coming to life
[1:14:07] was not just for himself
[1:14:11] but it was that the benefits of his
[1:14:14] resurrection
[1:14:16] and overcoming
[1:14:18] what were given to us
[1:14:20] that
[1:14:21] we could be benefactors of that
[1:14:25] resurrection
[1:14:27] and we talked about being a benefactor
[1:14:29] and so the one thing we're going to talk
[1:14:31] about now is the prophet of god is going
[1:14:33] to go into
[1:14:35] the type of the sheep offering
[1:14:38] and so we
[1:14:40] when we go to talk about types we want
[1:14:42] to understand something this morning
[1:14:45] that
[1:14:46] god knew
[1:14:47] what would be
[1:14:50] he makes this statement i i in paragraph
[1:14:53] 43 it's just a little quick uh statement
[1:14:57] that he makes
[1:14:58] but he says it in in such a manner
[1:15:02] that
[1:15:04] he says this he says
[1:15:06] he says he knew
[1:15:08] it would be
[1:15:10] and what
[1:15:11] more glorious sunrise that was
[1:15:15] than it was at the beginning at time
[1:15:18] when it first dawned so god knew
[1:15:22] what would be now that's a that's a
[1:15:25] beautiful thing because
[1:15:28] you know as our brother gave us the
[1:15:30] exhortation he said we try to set up
[1:15:33] places of refuge
[1:15:34] and and things come against us but we
[1:15:38] know our refuge is in the lord
[1:15:41] and why can our refuge be in the lord
[1:15:45] because he knew it
[1:15:48] he knew
[1:15:50] and because he knows that's how he can
[1:15:53] become a provider uh he sent abraham
[1:15:58] to the mountain
[1:16:00] and and with isaac carrying wood and
[1:16:02] isaac says to his father he says
[1:16:06] uh
[1:16:07] father that we got the fire
[1:16:10] amen we got the wood
[1:16:15] where's the sacrifice
[1:16:18] you know and he's not going to look at
[1:16:21] his son and say you're it.
[1:16:26] but he knew in his heart he said god
[1:16:28] knew this hour i think that's what
[1:16:31] abraham rested in he rested in the
[1:16:34] promise he rested that his seed was
[1:16:36] going to be like the stars
[1:16:38] he rested no matter what it was what god
[1:16:41] was asking him to do he knew that god
[1:16:45] knew it would be
[1:16:49] and therefore he said
[1:16:51] god will provide
[1:16:53] a sacrifice he's
[1:16:55] jehovah jirei he'll he'll provide
[1:17:00] and so we understand that god knew what
[1:17:02] would be so he knows
[1:17:05] what's going on
[1:17:07] he knew that we would have this conflict
[1:17:11] he knew about your personal conflict
[1:17:15] he knew about your life he knew about
[1:17:17] your weaknesses
[1:17:19] he he knows god knew what would be
[1:17:23] and therefore he
[1:17:26] he makes provisions
[1:17:29] so in knowing what would be
[1:17:31] he laid down all these types
[1:17:36] and we called the old testament many
[1:17:38] times we say the old testament was
[1:17:40] written in what shadows and types
[1:17:44] everything was typing
[1:17:47] the prophets didn't even know why they
[1:17:49] did what they did
[1:17:52] they didn't understand
[1:17:54] how they got in the circumstances that
[1:17:56] they got in
[1:17:58] they didn't understand the events
[1:18:01] that were happening around them
[1:18:04] they didn't understand
[1:18:06] why the things that they spoke
[1:18:09] came out of their mouth
[1:18:11] but god knew
[1:18:12] what would be
[1:18:16] so
[1:18:18] he placed
[1:18:19] all these types
[1:18:22] and he placed he placed them
[1:18:25] there he placed them there in the
[1:18:27] scriptures
[1:18:28] we spoke of the type of
[1:18:30] this morning brother mike did about
[1:18:32] david being the what rejected king
[1:18:38] you know being sought after and and and
[1:18:41] and
[1:18:42] in in saul
[1:18:44] being absorbed with uh
[1:18:47] jealousy and
[1:18:49] and uh but god knew that would be
[1:18:52] and then from that david wrote the
[1:18:55] psalms he wrote he he
[1:18:58] he he testified from that agony he he
[1:19:01] wrote type after type my bones they
[1:19:04] stare at me
[1:19:05] he you know he wrote so many things
[1:19:07] concerning
[1:19:09] the word of god
[1:19:12] shadows and types they were all
[1:19:15] placed in there
[1:19:17] and just like the whole universe was
[1:19:20] created in placed in order and it became
[1:19:23] the first gospel that was ever written
[1:19:26] so these these shadows and types were
[1:19:29] written
[1:19:30] were a written gospel
[1:19:34] so there's actually a gospel
[1:19:36] written in type
[1:19:39] and we know prophet of god said you know
[1:19:41] i'm a great typologist
[1:19:44] because he could read the gospel of
[1:19:48] types
[1:19:50] now just think of that
[1:19:53] to read the gospel of types
[1:19:57] because were asked this morning
[1:20:01] to read the gospel of a types because
[1:20:05] he's going to present to us a type
[1:20:08] this morning
[1:20:10] the messenger is going to go through a
[1:20:12] type he uses the words i want to spend a
[1:20:14] little time explaining this type to you
[1:20:19] because i think it'll help you
[1:20:22] and so
[1:20:23] these types were placed in the gospel
[1:20:28] so
[1:20:29] we can read them
[1:20:31] now just think
[1:20:34] we we're going back
[1:20:37] just like the quote we read this morning
[1:20:40] we're going back to things that the
[1:20:43] prophet of god said in 51
[1:20:47] 56
[1:20:49] the world's falling apart
[1:20:52] many other scriptures we are finding out
[1:20:55] that
[1:20:56] they the things that are coming to pass
[1:20:59] have already been spoken
[1:21:02] the the lady in purple
[1:21:04] uh many other prophecies and statements
[1:21:07] that we've seen all those things were
[1:21:10] laid there because he knew what would be
[1:21:14] remember
[1:21:16] modern events
[1:21:17] are not
[1:21:19] made clear by the new york times
[1:21:25] modern events are made clear by what
[1:21:27] prophecy
[1:21:29] now really you've got to turn that
[1:21:31] around
[1:21:33] really the events are made clear or in
[1:21:37] other words what the
[1:21:39] events really are
[1:21:41] were because they were prophesied
[1:21:47] why is russia doing what they're doing
[1:21:50] because they were prophesied to do it
[1:21:56] why do we have a plague
[1:21:59] and you notice they called it a plague
[1:22:05] we now we i would have never called it a
[1:22:07] plague
[1:22:08] you know and and it went across the land
[1:22:12] and
[1:22:13] and and
[1:22:14] we found out that
[1:22:16] uh
[1:22:17] the uh we weren't free from it
[1:22:22] but you understand faith doesn't keep us
[1:22:25] from it faith delivers us from it
[1:22:30] god was great gracious to us uh we we we
[1:22:34] didn't have in it we didn't lose any of
[1:22:37] our members i know we're a young vibrant
[1:22:41] congregation and if you don't mind i'm
[1:22:43] going to include myself in there if
[1:22:45] you'll give me that
[1:22:47] permission this morning
[1:22:49] but the things that are spoken are
[1:22:52] happening
[1:22:54] and we've got to get to the place where
[1:22:56] they stir us up
[1:23:01] and so we we saw these things and now we
[1:23:05] and that they're going on and and now we
[1:23:08] see this going on and you say well
[1:23:10] what's going on what's happening the
[1:23:12] whole thing i don't care if it drives
[1:23:15] the world's all uniting together it
[1:23:17] doesn't matter we know the world will
[1:23:19] unite together right because it's been
[1:23:22] prophesied
[1:23:25] go read uniting time and sign
[1:23:30] he says they're uniting
[1:23:32] but what else is going on there's
[1:23:34] another uniting going on
[1:23:38] and that's the uniting of the bride and
[1:23:41] the word
[1:23:43] there's another union
[1:23:46] i thought it was strange they say oh
[1:23:47] he's trying to put the soviet union back
[1:23:50] together
[1:23:54] another union
[1:23:58] well we have a union
[1:24:01] but ours is an invisible union
[1:24:04] between what
[1:24:05] a heavenly bridegroom
[1:24:08] and an earthly bride
[1:24:11] it's another union that's taking place
[1:24:14] so along with all the events of the
[1:24:17] world that are going on
[1:24:19] along with all the
[1:24:22] politics that's going on and all the
[1:24:25] voices and and all the things
[1:24:27] everything's right on time it's all been
[1:24:30] prophesied we've been told the world was
[1:24:33] was falling apart
[1:24:36] but we never let it soak in
[1:24:42] we never shake ourselves
[1:24:45] and say man
[1:24:48] just think
[1:24:50] i mean
[1:24:51] you got to understand you might look
[1:24:53] over and think of ukraine but ukraine is
[1:24:56] a modern city
[1:25:01] it looks like dallas
[1:25:04] or fort worth
[1:25:06] you know because it's not it's it's not
[1:25:09] medieval times
[1:25:11] these are real towns and real cities
[1:25:13] just like
[1:25:15] you know just tanks going down dallas
[1:25:17] and blowing stuff up and
[1:25:20] and all that's going on why wars
[1:25:23] rumors of
[1:25:24] war everything is perfect
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:29] everything is running to its place
[1:25:35] and its
[1:25:36] position
[1:25:37] so god's got a place for everything he
[1:25:41] knew what would be
[1:25:43] and therefore he's doing whatever he has
[1:25:46] to do
[1:25:47] to get everything to its place that it
[1:25:51] was prophesied
[1:25:55] god wanted to place paul
[1:25:58] as the first messenger to the church
[1:26:01] so he did whatever he had to do
[1:26:04] to get paul
[1:26:06] to that place
[1:26:08] knock them off the horse smite them
[1:26:10] blind
[1:26:11] you know take them to the desert it
[1:26:13] didn't matter
[1:26:15] and you can rest in that
[1:26:18] that god's in charge of your life
[1:26:21] whether you're running from him
[1:26:24] or not amen
[1:26:26] and he'll only let you run so long
[1:26:29] he'll only let you go so far
[1:26:33] and one day we hope that it's with a
[1:26:36] gentle hand of jehovah
[1:26:38] we hope that it's with instruction
[1:26:42] and and conviction
[1:26:44] that he can turn your course
[1:26:48] but if he has to he'll knock you off
[1:26:51] your horse
[1:26:55] but praise god
[1:26:58] amen
[1:26:59] amen whatever it takes
[1:27:02] lord jesus
[1:27:03] so as we we begin we looked at this
[1:27:06] message and we begin to
[1:27:09] fellowship around this the message of
[1:27:12] it's a rising of the sun
[1:27:14] we realize that our messenger that all
[1:27:17] these things were laid out here all
[1:27:18] these types are laid out here so we as
[1:27:21] believers can read them
[1:27:24] and we can see them
[1:27:26] and by these we can understand so you
[1:27:30] have to understand
[1:27:31] the types are given
[1:27:33] as a gospel
[1:27:35] that
[1:27:36] though only the believer can see it
[1:27:41] it's hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:27:45] prudent
[1:27:47] and revealed unto babes
[1:27:50] so it's in a type because god knew it he
[1:27:54] knew beforehand what would be
[1:27:57] so he could put the type there
[1:28:01] and then the type is placed there
[1:28:03] because he knows what it's typing
[1:28:08] and it's typed in there so nobody else
[1:28:11] can see it it goes right over their
[1:28:13] heads but the believer catches it
[1:28:18] it actually becomes a gospel to them
[1:28:21] and hold that as we move on now
[1:28:25] we understand that we were talking about
[1:28:27] the resurrection
[1:28:28] and we're talking about us being the
[1:28:31] benefactors of the resurrection so he
[1:28:34] rose up
[1:28:35] by the spirit that was in him
[1:28:39] is that right
[1:28:42] he said no man takes my life from me
[1:28:46] but i lay down my life
[1:28:48] and because i lay down my life i have
[1:28:51] power to take it up again
[1:28:54] and now he made this great statement
[1:28:57] because i live
[1:29:00] you shall live also
[1:29:04] i've overcome death hell
[1:29:07] and the
[1:29:08] grave
[1:29:10] now i have
[1:29:12] life
[1:29:14] in me as life
[1:29:16] and i'm going to give you
[1:29:18] this life
[1:29:21] now we read our scripture
[1:29:23] he said now you don't leave jerusalem
[1:29:26] until you wait here
[1:29:29] because there's a promise
[1:29:32] that the father made
[1:29:36] and that promise to jesus was
[1:29:39] that they could be baptized with the
[1:29:42] same baptism he was baptized with
[1:29:47] so you can imagine the great promise
[1:29:51] that jesus
[1:29:52] had he's going to lay down his life
[1:29:55] but he's not laying down his life
[1:29:57] without expectation that's right
[1:30:00] he's not laying down his life with
[1:30:03] not knowing what he's laying his life
[1:30:05] down for
[1:30:07] he's not laying because god knew what
[1:30:09] would be he's not laying down his life
[1:30:12] not knowing what he was going to
[1:30:15] accomplish
[1:30:16] he knew if he laid down his life
[1:30:21] that his own
[1:30:23] would receive what he had
[1:30:30] that he was able to impart
[1:30:33] the life that he had
[1:30:36] to them
[1:30:38] so we read this statement he says his
[1:30:41] spirit
[1:30:43] brings his same
[1:30:46] life
[1:30:47] again
[1:30:48] on the earth
[1:30:53] his spirit
[1:30:55] right brings the same life again
[1:30:59] to the earth
[1:31:00] so now his spirit is going to bring that
[1:31:04] life which is what
[1:31:06] eternal life
[1:31:08] he says
[1:31:10] on the earth if the spirit of god that
[1:31:13] raised up
[1:31:14] christ
[1:31:16] dwelleth in you
[1:31:18] it shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:31:23] and so we we understand that by his
[1:31:26] spirit so he just didn't go into the
[1:31:27] grave wondering what would happen
[1:31:30] he knew that if he overcame death
[1:31:34] and paid that price
[1:31:37] that now the predestinated seed of god
[1:31:40] could come to life
[1:31:44] otherwise
[1:31:46] it would just lay in the ground
[1:31:49] right
[1:31:50] now we know that was typed in creation
[1:31:54] because he went through it in the
[1:31:56] beginning every seed was in the ground
[1:31:58] it was dark it was void right but the
[1:32:02] s-u-n
[1:32:04] had to come up and bring those seeds to
[1:32:07] life what was that
[1:32:09] it was a tight
[1:32:12] because he had seed
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:17] and it was laying in the ground yes sir
[1:32:20] that's right
[1:32:21] and he knew that he had to come up
[1:32:25] and shine on that seed
[1:32:28] to bring it to life
[1:32:30] so that was a type
[1:32:34] everything working
[1:32:36] perfectly according to
[1:32:39] his plan
[1:32:41] so it brought life again
[1:32:43] on the earth now as we
[1:32:46] we looked at this we understood
[1:32:49] that we're just laying that or we're
[1:32:51] only listening to 11 minutes this
[1:32:53] morning
[1:32:54] so
[1:32:56] as we looked at this we saw that
[1:33:00] there was three
[1:33:02] stages or
[1:33:04] or parts that we were going to talk
[1:33:07] about
[1:33:08] that he said
[1:33:10] he would do and i have them wrote here
[1:33:12] but i'd like to
[1:33:16] read them again
[1:33:17] to you
[1:33:19] i know
[1:33:21] know i have them here somewhere
[1:33:26] let me see if i can find it
[1:33:32] i don't know if i have the page number
[1:33:33] well
[1:33:34] i look at them so many times that i
[1:33:38] but i'll just read them to you the first
[1:33:40] one
[1:33:41] the first of the three things that we
[1:33:44] knew that that he would do
[1:33:47] is that he was going to
[1:33:50] to
[1:33:51] tell us
[1:33:52] what the church was
[1:33:56] okay so he said the seven mysteries that
[1:33:59] were opened
[1:34:01] were open to accomplish
[1:34:03] three purposes
[1:34:06] and he said that
[1:34:08] these were sealed up
[1:34:10] and then when the seals were open
[1:34:13] if it brought it out to the church
[1:34:16] and the first thing that was brought out
[1:34:18] to the church is what the church was
[1:34:23] and so what was the church
[1:34:26] that the church was his female part
[1:34:33] you understand that you were part of him
[1:34:35] in the beginning she's called a what a
[1:34:37] bride
[1:34:38] that is called the the church so what
[1:34:41] was
[1:34:43] the church
[1:34:45] what was she
[1:34:48] you know she's not a group of worshipers
[1:34:52] because men worship god from every place
[1:34:54] they worship the stars they worship the
[1:34:57] sun they worship the moon but she was
[1:35:00] something that was
[1:35:02] happy birthday by the way
[1:35:05] she was something that was
[1:35:08] special
[1:35:11] and unique
[1:35:13] so what was the seals going to reveal
[1:35:17] who was the church what the church was
[1:35:22] not
[1:35:23] man-made
[1:35:24] kingdoms
[1:35:26] not man-made denominations that's not
[1:35:29] the church that's denominational fiction
[1:35:34] that's never what the church was
[1:35:40] the church was not an assembly
[1:35:43] of historians
[1:35:46] looking back on the life of christ
[1:35:49] and developing a system to worship him
[1:35:55] that's not what the church was
[1:35:57] church is not buildings
[1:36:03] so when i when you think of church
[1:36:07] because we go to church how many
[1:36:10] churches do you think there are dallas
[1:36:12] fort worth you say well over probably 5
[1:36:15] 000
[1:36:17] that isn't the church
[1:36:21] the church is one thing
[1:36:24] and one thing only
[1:36:27] the bride of christ
[1:36:31] the female
[1:36:33] part
[1:36:34] of god
[1:36:35] that what the church was
[1:36:38] part of him
[1:36:41] it was his bride
[1:36:44] that's right
[1:36:45] oh we could go into so many things right
[1:36:49] here i i want to but i don't
[1:36:51] maybe i can come back to it
[1:36:54] later but basically salt satan stole
[1:37:00] his wife
[1:37:05] right
[1:37:06] and he came back to get her back
[1:37:13] remember because the prophet of god said
[1:37:15] she was deceived into it that's what
[1:37:18] marriage and divorce is about
[1:37:20] it isn't about all your little
[1:37:22] relationship problems
[1:37:27] marriage in divorce is about
[1:37:30] satan took his wife
[1:37:34] and he came back to redeem her back
[1:37:38] and to get her back
[1:37:42] and to cleanse her and watch her like
[1:37:44] she had never done it in the first place
[1:37:47] and to restore back a hundred percent
[1:37:50] pure back to the word of god
[1:37:57] and
[1:37:58] to divorce her
[1:38:02] you think that you divorce no
[1:38:05] he divorces you from him by killing him
[1:38:11] in your life
[1:38:17] think of it
[1:38:21] you didn't all of a sudden decide oh
[1:38:24] i'm not going to love the world no more
[1:38:26] and i'm going to go serve you
[1:38:31] like a man told me one time he said you
[1:38:33] know he said i sing christian music now
[1:38:36] i said that's good he says you know he
[1:38:39] said i tried to sing for the world but i
[1:38:42] starved to death
[1:38:47] and i thought what
[1:38:50] so you're over here because there's more
[1:38:51] money on this side of the thing than
[1:38:53] there's on that side but if you would
[1:38:55] have become a star
[1:39:00] i think a lot of these so-called
[1:39:02] christian musicians today are just guys
[1:39:05] that couldn't make it in the world but
[1:39:07] they still want to play rock and roll
[1:39:12] so there's some lukewarm bunch of guys
[1:39:15] out there that
[1:39:17] get a bunch of so-called lukewarm
[1:39:19] christians to listen to them same beat
[1:39:22] same music same stuff if you you know
[1:39:24] what i mean but they've suckered a new
[1:39:27] audience
[1:39:28] excuse me for
[1:39:31] going there but
[1:39:33] so what was she
[1:39:37] you
[1:39:38] you can never
[1:39:39] amount to being who you are
[1:39:43] until you can claim your identity
[1:39:48] tell you i know you can't go in and and
[1:39:51] and accept the benefits
[1:39:54] what we talked about last week of the
[1:39:56] resurrection
[1:39:58] until you can say i am air
[1:40:01] i'm joined air
[1:40:05] i'm his
[1:40:06] child i'm married to the son
[1:40:10] i'm the bride
[1:40:12] this is my inheritance
[1:40:16] he killed the
[1:40:20] brought me out of my egypt
[1:40:24] so that's what she had that and all
[1:40:26] through the message she's a part of him
[1:40:29] she was with him in the beginning she
[1:40:31] was she was
[1:40:33] in his thoughts right
[1:40:36] so what was she what was the church
[1:40:41] he's not talking about the mechanical
[1:40:43] makeup
[1:40:44] that's right he he's talking what
[1:40:47] the church
[1:40:49] was
[1:40:50] not was the church which would indicate
[1:40:56] history
[1:40:58] right
[1:41:00] and reenactment
[1:41:04] trying to reproduce
[1:41:07] this is what she was
[1:41:09] like someone that says i i i i i was 150
[1:41:15] pounds
[1:41:16] so i'm going to do everything i can to
[1:41:18] get back to 150 pounds that that that
[1:41:23] that's going back to what
[1:41:25] uh what was the church
[1:41:27] but this is not what was the church this
[1:41:31] was what the church
[1:41:34] was
[1:41:36] so it's her identification
[1:41:40] of who she is now remember he said when
[1:41:43] the church recognizes who she is
[1:41:49] then she becomes that person
[1:41:52] because she's not struggling to obtain
[1:41:55] something or go back to something she
[1:41:58] understands that she's something that
[1:42:01] was made
[1:42:05] i was made the bride of christ i didn't
[1:42:08] earn the bride of christ
[1:42:14] i didn't have to get dressed up in my
[1:42:16] best dress
[1:42:23] put on my best
[1:42:25] shine you know
[1:42:28] so
[1:42:29] i could impress
[1:42:34] do you know how it is and
[1:42:36] and
[1:42:38] and
[1:42:39] spend
[1:42:40] hours working with my hair until
[1:42:43] i got confidence
[1:42:45] because i want to display confidence i
[1:42:47] didn't win the lord
[1:42:53] the only reason he found me because he
[1:42:56] knew me
[1:43:01] the only reason the eagle found the ch
[1:43:04] eagle in the chicken pin because she
[1:43:07] knew he had
[1:43:09] her somewhere
[1:43:12] and he went looking for her
[1:43:14] and found her
[1:43:16] now it might have known it might have
[1:43:19] been a chicken and acting like a chicken
[1:43:21] but it wasn't a chicken you have been in
[1:43:23] the world you may been in egypt you may
[1:43:25] have been in the chicken yard but you're
[1:43:27] not an egyptian and you're not a chicken
[1:43:32] what were you
[1:43:34] what was the church
[1:43:38] the church was what
[1:43:40] the church was she was the bride of
[1:43:43] christ she's scattered everywhere
[1:43:49] but what was the good shepherd
[1:43:52] he went out to get her back into the
[1:43:54] fold
[1:43:59] so you've got to we've got to realize
[1:44:02] that you are not some worldly person who
[1:44:06] became a christian
[1:44:09] you're not a pig
[1:44:11] turned into a sheep
[1:44:15] you were a sheep in the pigpen but you
[1:44:18] were always a sheep you were a sheep to
[1:44:21] begin with you were always bride you
[1:44:24] were bright to begin with
[1:44:29] it didn't matter
[1:44:31] the woman at the well
[1:44:34] as dark as she was
[1:44:37] six dark church ages
[1:44:42] and the one that she was with
[1:44:46] that pale ugly horse
[1:44:50] types types types
[1:44:52] everywhere
[1:44:54] wasn't her husband
[1:44:56] but guess who she meant at the well
[1:45:00] she meant her husband
[1:45:05] she meant the husband that she was
[1:45:07] always meant to be with
[1:45:12] that's right
[1:45:15] the one that washed his feet
[1:45:17] the one that was going to be stoned
[1:45:20] it didn't matter where he found him
[1:45:23] right
[1:45:24] he found him one by one they found him
[1:45:28] why because he knew
[1:45:31] what the church was
[1:45:33] he knew this person in this dark hippie
[1:45:36] state this person sitting on this bar
[1:45:39] stool this person tied up in all kinds
[1:45:42] of drugs this person over here and all
[1:45:45] kinds of doesn't matter he comes by and
[1:45:47] he says that name that person's on the
[1:45:50] lam's book of life i have identity with
[1:45:52] that person i know who that person is
[1:45:56] i saw it in the beginning i know the
[1:45:58] color of his eyes the color of his hair
[1:46:00] and i have come
[1:46:05] to bring her back
[1:46:07] and to restore her
[1:46:09] justifier sanctifier and filler with my
[1:46:13] life
[1:46:17] so
[1:46:17] we understand what the church was
[1:46:21] it was his female part
[1:46:25] it was the party lost
[1:46:29] how many no prophet of god said that
[1:46:30] he's not complete without us
[1:46:35] you ever consider how important you are
[1:46:40] you're important to him
[1:46:44] how important do you think your heart is
[1:46:50] take it out
[1:46:51] see how you do
[1:46:56] you can't
[1:47:00] you can't live without air
[1:47:04] everybody's living by the grace of god
[1:47:09] so
[1:47:10] so that's what
[1:47:13] the church was
[1:47:15] so it's not church get church out of
[1:47:18] your mind get denominations out of your
[1:47:21] mind get going on sunday out of your
[1:47:25] mind
[1:47:27] there's only one
[1:47:28] true
[1:47:29] church
[1:47:32] and that was those that were a part of
[1:47:35] him in the beginning
[1:47:38] everything else is a man-made stew
[1:47:43] of a little bible a little politics a
[1:47:47] little world a little pleasure and it's
[1:47:50] just a big old stew
[1:47:55] poison in the pot
[1:47:58] it's all it is
[1:47:59] it's a beagle's
[1:48:02] stew because we're going to talk about
[1:48:05] something this morning
[1:48:07] and he's going to talk about it
[1:48:10] so the second thing
[1:48:12] was how it was in christ in
[1:48:16] at the beginning
[1:48:19] okay if she's a part of him
[1:48:23] right and that's his bride that's what
[1:48:25] she is it's not all this worship out
[1:48:27] here not baptist presbyterian methodist
[1:48:30] what are those things
[1:48:31] they're blasphemous what
[1:48:34] names
[1:48:36] not organization not christianity is a
[1:48:39] society not christianity is a social way
[1:48:42] of life not christianity there's one
[1:48:45] church and one church only and that was
[1:48:48] the church that was a part of him in the
[1:48:50] beginning his bride
[1:48:56] end the story
[1:49:00] no such thing as assembly of god church
[1:49:04] what did the prophet of god call him
[1:49:07] lodge
[1:49:10] just think of all the things brother
[1:49:12] brahms been telling us that slips away
[1:49:15] from us because we're not seeing the
[1:49:17] whole picture
[1:49:19] lodge
[1:49:22] all it is is a lodge
[1:49:24] then he says to
[1:49:25] how she was in christ in the beginning
[1:49:28] we go we know that we've been over 100
[1:49:29] time we're in his thinking we're a part
[1:49:32] of his attributes he wanted to explain
[1:49:35] to show this other side of himself to us
[1:49:38] he never lost us
[1:49:42] he secured us
[1:49:44] by giving us a title deed
[1:49:47] on the lamb's book of life
[1:49:52] i think brother nathan this last weekend
[1:49:55] referred to it as a world between worlds
[1:49:59] we referred to it earlier as a world
[1:50:02] within a world
[1:50:05] but just drop down right
[1:50:08] so we could know he's a healer a
[1:50:10] deliverer we had never known none of
[1:50:11] those attributes on the other side
[1:50:14] so he never left us
[1:50:16] he just brought us here
[1:50:19] let us go for this little period of time
[1:50:21] and then picks us up again right we
[1:50:23] understand that so we understand where
[1:50:25] we're in the beginning now this is what
[1:50:28] we're going to cover this morning
[1:50:31] is the third
[1:50:34] step
[1:50:35] or the third thing that the opening of
[1:50:37] the seals
[1:50:39] was to accomplish
[1:50:41] how it would be revealed in the last
[1:50:44] days
[1:50:48] this is what we're going to realize this
[1:50:51] morning is how the church was going to
[1:50:54] be revealed in the last days how was the
[1:50:57] bride going to be revealed how was he
[1:51:01] going to do it
[1:51:04] we know what she was what the church was
[1:51:06] it was this female part it was his bride
[1:51:10] we know that she was with him in the
[1:51:13] beginning
[1:51:15] now the last step is supposed to be is
[1:51:17] to show her how she was going to be
[1:51:21] revealed
[1:51:22] so he makes
[1:51:24] in this type
[1:51:26] that we're going to read and we can go
[1:51:29] to paragraph
[1:51:30] uh
[1:51:34] uh
[1:51:37] uh 82
[1:51:40] and it would just put that on the bar
[1:51:42] just fixing the plate right now
[1:51:45] but
[1:51:51] he reads the scripture here
[1:51:53] and the scripture that's going to be
[1:51:55] read is found in the book of leviticus
[1:51:57] the 23rd chapter
[1:51:59] and the 9th through the 11th verse
[1:52:05] and he says speak unto the children of
[1:52:07] israel and say unto them
[1:52:09] when you come into the land which i
[1:52:14] have given you
[1:52:16] and then in 82 he says unto the place
[1:52:19] the position
[1:52:21] that i have given unto you
[1:52:25] now you speak to the children of israel
[1:52:29] that when you get
[1:52:31] to this certain place
[1:52:33] that i promised you
[1:52:38] i take you
[1:52:40] when you get there in this land now
[1:52:44] that's a natural type so what teaches
[1:52:47] tommy says when you get to a certain
[1:52:49] place
[1:52:51] okay so what what he's talking about
[1:52:53] here is there's an exodus taking place
[1:52:57] right there's a coming out
[1:52:59] which is a what
[1:53:01] a type
[1:53:04] so the coming out so when you come out
[1:53:07] of egypt
[1:53:09] when you come out and you get to this
[1:53:12] place
[1:53:15] when you go through this exodus when you
[1:53:18] come out and you get to this place
[1:53:22] that's when you've got to so first of
[1:53:25] all
[1:53:26] you've got to get to the place
[1:53:29] and in order for them to get to the
[1:53:31] promised land they had to totally
[1:53:35] fully
[1:53:36] come out of egypt
[1:53:41] they had to
[1:53:42] they had to totally come out and egypt
[1:53:45] was a type of the world
[1:53:48] so the first place you got to see this
[1:53:50] type first of all they had to come out
[1:53:54] there had to be an exodus
[1:53:59] because there's something that's going
[1:54:00] to transpire
[1:54:02] so we're talking about a natural type
[1:54:05] bringing it to the spiritual type of how
[1:54:07] he's going to reveal himself so
[1:54:10] we've got to come to the place
[1:54:13] where you have a complete and full
[1:54:16] revelation
[1:54:18] that this is the spirit-filled word
[1:54:23] is the absolute
[1:54:25] truth
[1:54:29] that's right so
[1:54:32] you won't be able to go any farther
[1:54:37] until you come to the realization
[1:54:40] that
[1:54:41] that pillar of fire
[1:54:44] was the what
[1:54:46] it was a picture
[1:54:48] that god allowed to be caught in this
[1:54:51] modern age of the same pillar of fire
[1:54:54] that led the children of egypt out into
[1:54:59] a place
[1:55:01] that was promised
[1:55:08] right
[1:55:09] and he led him by
[1:55:11] and then we have a picture of a cloud
[1:55:14] and that is a type of the cloud
[1:55:17] pillar of fire by night cloud by day
[1:55:20] here we are in our day got a pillar of
[1:55:23] fire and got a cloud which tells us that
[1:55:26] we're in a what
[1:55:29] in an exodus
[1:55:37] so he's saying after the exodus
[1:55:42] right
[1:55:43] now
[1:55:46] there was a second exodus
[1:55:49] wasn't there
[1:55:51] and it was the exodus of the law
[1:55:55] and what did they have to do they had to
[1:55:56] be totally sold out to christ
[1:56:01] totally come out of the law
[1:56:08] and go in the upper room
[1:56:12] and what happened
[1:56:15] a rushing wind and what
[1:56:18] cloven
[1:56:21] tongues
[1:56:22] of fire
[1:56:26] why type
[1:56:30] exodus
[1:56:34] right
[1:56:36] so they had to be totally
[1:56:39] out
[1:56:41] sold out
[1:56:43] if you're halfway with this message
[1:56:46] and you have any reservations
[1:56:49] you will never
[1:56:52] be a benefactor
[1:56:56] of it
[1:56:59] you'll be in a struggle
[1:57:01] but when you're sold out
[1:57:04] beyond a shadow of a doubt you know this
[1:57:06] is the truth
[1:57:08] and it's your absolute
[1:57:10] now you're in a place
[1:57:12] now what happens he said now when you
[1:57:14] get to this land
[1:57:18] and you plant
[1:57:23] and after you've planted in this land
[1:57:27] so he's telling him there's going to be
[1:57:28] a land you're going to have an exodus
[1:57:30] you're going to go to a promised land
[1:57:32] but when you get to the promised land
[1:57:34] when you plant
[1:57:36] it will mature
[1:57:39] and then when you get this
[1:57:42] this
[1:57:44] after you plant
[1:57:46] now let me say this you've got to be
[1:57:49] into the land completely
[1:57:53] so you've got to be totally in the land
[1:57:55] of the message
[1:57:57] and that's when you start planning
[1:58:00] if you don't take the word
[1:58:04] and plant it in your life
[1:58:06] it will not mature
[1:58:11] so you got to take the word
[1:58:14] plant it in your life
[1:58:16] and then that that that'll grow
[1:58:19] and it will produce
[1:58:21] and mature into his life
[1:58:27] now we're talking this type here
[1:58:30] because now he's going to explain this
[1:58:33] type so what did they do when they got
[1:58:35] into the land they planted in that land
[1:58:39] when you come into the message of the
[1:58:41] hour the word of god the word of promise
[1:58:45] we call it the message of the hour but
[1:58:47] the truth of the matter is it's the
[1:58:49] gospel
[1:58:50] of the hour it's the word of the hour
[1:58:54] god is not history god is present tense
[1:59:02] when you're the spirit of god
[1:59:05] is planning himself
[1:59:08] in your life
[1:59:10] to bring you to maturity
[1:59:12] and and to bring you to life so you've
[1:59:15] got to come out
[1:59:17] you've got to totally take the word of
[1:59:19] god
[1:59:20] plan it in your life and it'll start
[1:59:23] growing to maturity so now he's going to
[1:59:26] take to us
[1:59:27] and share with us the type of leviticus
[1:59:30] so let's just listen for 11 minutes of
[1:59:33] tape real careful look at it close
[1:59:36] listen to every line and then we'll be
[1:59:39] back and close

[1:59:52] whatever you might bring them to church
[1:59:53] with you

[1:59:56] through this message because it's
[1:59:59] it's so rich
[2:00:00] that we just take it in a few places so
[2:00:03] just try to stay awake 11 minutes you
[2:00:06] can fall asleep on me but don't don't
[2:00:08] fall asleep on the voice of god

[2:00:35] scripture
[2:00:36] i got wrote down here it might help you
[2:00:38] a little it's found in the book of
[2:00:41] leviticus the 23rd chapter the 9th to
[2:00:45] the 11th verse

[2:00:50] god speaking to
[2:00:52] moses listen
[2:00:55] all these things are types now
[2:00:59] and we'll stop here for a few moments
[2:01:01] to get into this type
[2:01:03] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[2:01:07] speak unto the children
[2:01:09] of israel and say unto them when you
[2:01:13] come into the land which i give unto you
[2:01:18] unto the place of position
[2:01:22] that i have given unto you
[2:01:25] how you speak to the children of israel
[2:01:28] that when you get to this certain place
[2:01:31] that i promise you
[2:01:34] i take you
[2:01:36] when you get there in this land now
[2:01:38] speaking natural here type in the
[2:01:40] spiritual
[2:01:42] and shall reap the harvest thereof you
[2:01:44] may receive what i told you
[2:01:47] thereof then you shall bring
[2:01:49] a sheaf
[2:01:51] of the first fruits of your harvest
[2:01:55] unto the priests
[2:01:57] and he shall wave the sheep before the
[2:02:00] lord
[2:02:01] to be accepted for you
[2:02:05] on the mara after the sabbath
[2:02:09] the priest shall weave it
[2:02:12] if there would be any holy ritual
[2:02:16] it should come forth on the sabbath day
[2:02:20] which was the
[2:02:22] seventh day of the week which is
[2:02:24] saturday
[2:02:26] but did you notice
[2:02:28] in this memorial
[2:02:30] the wave it on the first day of the week
[2:02:36] the sheep
[2:02:38] which was the first
[2:02:40] of your seed that you planted
[2:02:43] when it comes up and ripens
[2:02:46] you cut down this sheath
[2:02:49] and take it to the priest
[2:02:52] and let him take it and wave it before
[2:02:54] the lord
[2:02:57] for your exception
[2:02:59] that you are accepted you have come with
[2:03:02] your sheep and he used to wave it before
[2:03:04] the lord on
[2:03:06] not on the sabbath
[2:03:08] the seventh day but on the first date
[2:03:11] which we call
[2:03:13] sunday
[2:03:15] s-u-n-d-a-y
[2:03:17] of course that's a roman
[2:03:19] uh word
[2:03:20] which they called it the sunday for the
[2:03:23] sun god but how it is changed it's not
[2:03:27] s-u-n anymore it's the
[2:03:29] s-o-n-d-a-y the sunday
[2:03:33] that that carnal week
[2:03:36] god's first one up from the dead
[2:03:40] is to be waved over the congregation
[2:03:45] that we
[2:03:46] are
[2:03:47] his seed and that's the first of the
[2:03:50] seed of those that slip
[2:03:53] waved upon the first day of the week on
[2:03:56] sunday he raised up
[2:03:59] wave
[2:04:00] goodbye
[2:04:02] and ascended up on high
[2:04:04] in the presence of the people notice
[2:04:07] it was the first corn of god's wheat
[2:04:10] that had been raised from the dead
[2:04:14] god's first corner week by god's
[2:04:16] quickening power
[2:04:18] god had quickened his life raised him up
[2:04:21] from the dead and he was the first
[2:04:23] fruits of those that slept
[2:04:26] the first fruit he was that sheep that's
[2:04:29] why they had to weigh that sheep
[2:04:31] or it was the first one that come to
[2:04:33] maturity
[2:04:36] and it was weighed as a memorial of
[2:04:38] thanksgiving to god believing that the
[2:04:41] rest of them would come
[2:04:43] there was a sign
[2:04:44] and today because he was the first
[2:04:48] son of god to come to full maturity to
[2:04:51] be in god
[2:04:53] he was plucked up from the earth and has
[2:04:55] waved over the people
[2:04:57] oh what a glorious lesson
[2:05:00] by the quickening power the first one
[2:05:03] although it you've been typed in many
[2:05:05] times and we'll see later he was typed
[2:05:08] but this is really the first fruits of
[2:05:10] them to slept
[2:05:11] he was waved
[2:05:13] over
[2:05:14] the promised
[2:05:15] seed
[2:05:16] that had promise of life he was waved at
[2:05:20] the day of pentecost when there came a
[2:05:22] sound from heaven like a waving mighty
[2:05:26] rushing wind
[2:05:27] and was waved over the people
[2:05:30] the pentecostal people that was up at
[2:05:32] pentecost waiting for
[2:05:35] uh the blessing to come
[2:05:36] and to be waived
[2:05:39] again we realized in the last days
[2:05:42] according to luke 17 30 in the sunday
[2:05:45] again in the days that the etholene of
[2:05:48] man
[2:05:48] will be revealed or waved again over the
[2:05:52] people
[2:05:53] who is the son of man
[2:05:54] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:05:58] word was with god and the word was god
[2:06:02] and the word would make flesh and dwelt
[2:06:05] among us
[2:06:06] and of all the teaching that we have in
[2:06:08] confirmation of the word of god by word
[2:06:12] of god by signs by wonders
[2:06:15] we see the day that in the book of of
[2:06:19] luke here as we just quoted from the
[2:06:22] luke the 17th chapter 31st and malachi 4
[2:06:25] in the different scriptures that we are
[2:06:27] acquainted with that that word again
[2:06:31] is ways over the people that the dead
[2:06:34] traditions of man is dead and the shot
[2:06:38] of god is alive again with the baptism
[2:06:41] of the holy spirit right among us has
[2:06:43] given us life
[2:06:47] as
[2:06:48] christ was the first one to raise from
[2:06:51] all the prophets and so forth all those
[2:06:54] types in many places he was the first
[2:06:56] fruits of those who slept and the bride
[2:06:59] coming up christ coming out of the
[2:07:01] church there'll have to be a sheep waved
[2:07:04] again in the last days
[2:07:07] oh
[2:07:10] waiting of the sheep what was the sheath
[2:07:13] the first one that come to mature
[2:07:16] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[2:07:19] that proved it was a sheep
[2:07:23] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[2:07:25] i don't know he was waved over the
[2:07:28] people
[2:07:29] and the first time there will come forth
[2:07:31] for the fraud age for a resurrection out
[2:07:34] of dark denominationalism it will be a
[2:07:38] message
[2:07:39] that the form of turkey all the word has
[2:07:41] turned back again in its full power and
[2:07:44] being waved over the people by the same
[2:07:47] signs and wonders that he did that day
[2:07:50] all right it's called aliens
[2:07:52] he live also
[2:07:54] speaking to his wife
[2:07:56] because i live
[2:07:58] you live also what a resurrection
[2:08:02] does that work
[2:08:03] and what a resurrection this is
[2:08:06] to be quickened from the dead
[2:08:09] to be made alive in christ jesus by
[2:08:13] god's quickening power
[2:08:15] he was waved to them
[2:08:17] the word
[2:08:18] which he was was way back to him on the
[2:08:21] day of pentecost the word made manifest
[2:08:24] now
[2:08:25] and he's our stage to be waved again in
[2:08:27] the last days
[2:08:29] now for instance
[2:08:30] you say when i awaken it brother abraham
[2:08:33] i know what church that well i do too
[2:08:36] but now for instance what if if we were
[2:08:39] going to go back
[2:08:40] to tucson this afternoon
[2:08:44] now and each one of us
[2:08:46] had a was going to go in a
[2:08:49] a big cadillac brand new
[2:08:52] and all of the seats
[2:08:54] were made out of absolute skin
[2:08:58] softest of the leather
[2:09:00] soft and easy to sit in
[2:09:02] and the floorboards
[2:09:04] were plush
[2:09:06] the steering wheel were nickel plated
[2:09:09] and had diamond studs all over it
[2:09:12] and the engine was mechanically
[2:09:15] tested to be exactly the right engine
[2:09:19] and the wheels were all had bearings and
[2:09:22] greased up
[2:09:24] and the tires were all puncture proof
[2:09:27] and blowout freeze
[2:09:29] all been tested scientifically
[2:09:32] they've been pushed off the assembly
[2:09:34] lines both of them and both of them
[2:09:36] filled up with gasoline
[2:09:39] that's the running power
[2:09:42] the gasoline because it is the
[2:09:44] oxygen but now
[2:09:47] when you're going to start them
[2:09:51] all don't bulk up look just alike
[2:09:55] but there's one of them don't have any
[2:09:57] spark
[2:10:00] any firing power
[2:10:03] what do you say the power is in the
[2:10:05] gasoline brother
[2:10:07] but i don't care how much power is in
[2:10:09] the gasoline unless there's a spark
[2:10:11] there
[2:10:13] to manifest those powers
[2:10:16] as there's a power there to confirm that
[2:10:20] that's gasoline it just might as well be
[2:10:22] water
[2:10:24] until no matter how much theologians
[2:10:27] claim
[2:10:28] how well you got your church set
[2:10:31] how much education you got how much like
[2:10:33] the bible until that wave sheath
[2:10:37] until that holy spirit comes upon that
[2:10:42] person to quicken that word
[2:10:45] the gasoline represents the word it's
[2:10:47] the truth but without the spirit it
[2:10:50] won't move
[2:10:56] amen not just a few seconds
[2:10:59] it seemed like didn't it it's hard to
[2:11:01] believe that was supposed to be 11
[2:11:02] minutes
[2:11:04] i don't know it didn't feel like nothing
[2:11:05] to me
[2:11:07] but let's just let's just not run
[2:11:10] away
[2:11:11] real quick let's just
[2:11:13] go over just a few point out just a few
[2:11:15] things
[2:11:17] that
[2:11:18] that was
[2:11:19] that was a
[2:11:22] taking
[2:11:23] place
[2:11:24] so first of all we understood that we're
[2:11:28] talking he says i want to talk to you
[2:11:29] about this type
[2:11:31] so
[2:11:32] it was waived on
[2:11:34] a
[2:11:36] not on a sabbath day
[2:11:39] not on what would be considered
[2:11:41] a
[2:11:42] day of
[2:11:44] the religious
[2:11:46] man's religious form
[2:11:49] but it was waived on
[2:11:51] the first day of the week
[2:11:53] which was represented as we know sunday
[2:11:56] now
[2:11:57] let's just don't miss this little
[2:11:59] thought i thought it was a good thing so
[2:12:01] we understand
[2:12:03] that
[2:12:04] it it represented
[2:12:07] what came to maturity
[2:12:10] now
[2:12:12] i want to say this
[2:12:16] just right if i can i want to see if i
[2:12:19] can say it just right here
[2:12:21] that
[2:12:22] now
[2:12:23] we know it was the first day
[2:12:26] now if the waving
[2:12:29] wasn't the event
[2:12:34] of the resurrection
[2:12:37] so we say oh jesus rose so him rising
[2:12:41] from the dead
[2:12:42] that was the sheep offering that's not
[2:12:44] really exactly what the chief offering
[2:12:47] was because
[2:12:49] that was it came to maturity so in type
[2:12:52] all the wheat that came to maturity
[2:12:55] right it was wheat
[2:12:58] then
[2:13:01] that which excuse me
[2:13:04] that which was mature
[2:13:09] so when he came from the grave he was
[2:13:12] the first one to come to maturity
[2:13:15] now we ask ourselves oh wait a minute
[2:13:18] what about
[2:13:20] enoch
[2:13:22] what about elijah what about
[2:13:27] who else was there
[2:13:29] moses
[2:13:32] well he said now he was typed
[2:13:35] in many places
[2:13:38] but they weren't the first fruit
[2:13:42] they were just types
[2:13:44] so so and that's what he said they were
[2:13:46] typed in many places so moses he he was
[2:13:50] caught by the angels elijah was quick
[2:13:52] and enoch was quickened so he's talking
[2:13:55] about the power
[2:13:59] that would quicken them
[2:14:02] so he had to type that
[2:14:04] also
[2:14:08] because if god ever does one thing one
[2:14:10] way
[2:14:10] he's got to continue to do it
[2:14:13] the same way so that was a type also so
[2:14:16] all those types were there it was in
[2:14:19] many types so he come to maturity
[2:14:23] so it's not the maturity that was
[2:14:27] that was represented
[2:14:30] it was the life
[2:14:32] because when the thing matured
[2:14:35] what happens it comes up through the
[2:14:37] stock it comes up to the tassel it comes
[2:14:40] up to the seed
[2:14:42] then the shuck pulls away from it and
[2:14:45] then it's back to seed again
[2:14:47] it's back to what went into the ground
[2:14:50] therefore it has the
[2:14:52] life to reproduce itself
[2:14:56] so
[2:14:57] after it came to maturity
[2:15:01] so he came out of the grave
[2:15:05] proving what that sin no longer had hold
[2:15:09] of them
[2:15:10] the day you sin is the day you die
[2:15:14] which of you can convict me of sin
[2:15:18] well would have done any good if he
[2:15:19] never sinned and went into the grave
[2:15:24] but when he matured
[2:15:26] you say when was he mature
[2:15:29] father
[2:15:33] let this cup pass from me
[2:15:37] but nevertheless
[2:15:39] thy
[2:15:40] will
[2:15:42] be
[2:15:43] done
[2:15:47] he had
[2:15:48] power don't think he didn't
[2:15:52] that guy coming chopped off
[2:15:55] in fact that we even know the bible
[2:15:57] tells us when they all came up and they
[2:15:59] said we see jesus and now she says i am
[2:16:02] he they all fell back
[2:16:07] then peter
[2:16:09] you know
[2:16:10] a little while ago peter wouldn't even
[2:16:12] let him wash his feet
[2:16:14] then he wanted to be washed his hands in
[2:16:16] his head you know peter pulls out his
[2:16:18] sword cuts the high priest the servant's
[2:16:20] ear off i think it is
[2:16:23] jesus picks it up
[2:16:28] and puts it back on
[2:16:36] there were so blinded
[2:16:43] that was he was mature
[2:16:47] he went into the grave and that maturity
[2:16:49] proved because he said i have power to
[2:16:51] lay my life down i have power to take it
[2:16:54] up nobody takes my life from me
[2:16:58] but i lay down my life
[2:17:02] for you
[2:17:04] that you might have life also that's a
[2:17:07] mature christian oh are we ready to come
[2:17:09] to that place
[2:17:12] let this mind be in you that was in
[2:17:14] christ let every man look after the
[2:17:16] needs of others over his own
[2:17:19] that's that maturity
[2:17:22] he came to full maturity
[2:17:24] full maturity that he could lay down his
[2:17:26] life he had the power to take it up
[2:17:29] again but it took full maturity to lay
[2:17:32] it down
[2:17:34] oh hallelujah
[2:17:38] he knew what was written of him
[2:17:40] how he would suffer
[2:17:42] he told them many things i
[2:17:45] have to suffer
[2:17:46] many things i have to share but you
[2:17:48] can't bear them
[2:17:50] he knew what he was going through but he
[2:17:52] came to maturity
[2:17:56] he came to that maturity in the garden
[2:17:59] of gethsemane
[2:18:02] angels were all around him he could have
[2:18:04] called the angels down there set up his
[2:18:07] kingdom right then
[2:18:10] but i loved that song when he was on the
[2:18:12] cross
[2:18:14] i was on his mind
[2:18:16] he went there for you
[2:18:18] and he went there and he laid down his
[2:18:20] life and then he took it up again
[2:18:23] took him resurrecting
[2:18:25] that that life that was in him that
[2:18:29] event
[2:18:30] was not the wave offering
[2:18:33] it was the event
[2:18:36] was the proof of the maturity
[2:18:42] that he was a true son of god
[2:18:44] had the power of son of god because he
[2:18:47] could lay his life down and take it up
[2:18:50] again so he proved that that's what he
[2:18:54] was
[2:18:55] but the the
[2:18:56] but so the event was just the was of the
[2:19:00] resurrection was just the maturity but
[2:19:04] the waving if you go back to paragraph
[2:19:10] 90
[2:19:12] and 91
[2:19:17] and they said and he had
[2:19:20] entered
[2:19:22] and today because he was the first son
[2:19:24] of god to come to full maturity
[2:19:28] to be in god
[2:19:30] he was plucked up from the earth and is
[2:19:34] waved over the people
[2:19:36] oh what a glorious lesson
[2:19:39] by the quickening power
[2:19:41] the first one
[2:19:42] although he had been
[2:19:44] typed in many
[2:19:47] times as we'll see later he was typed
[2:19:50] but this was really the first fruit of
[2:19:53] them that slept
[2:19:56] that was waved over the promised seed of
[2:19:59] life so the event of him coming out of
[2:20:02] the grave was the maturity
[2:20:05] the waving
[2:20:07] now look at right here in 91
[2:20:10] he was waived at the day of pentecost
[2:20:15] when there came a sound from heaven
[2:20:18] like a waving mighty rushing wind
[2:20:23] and was waved over the people
[2:20:26] at the pentecostal people that was up at
[2:20:30] that pentecost waiting for
[2:20:33] that blessing
[2:20:35] to come
[2:20:36] so it was the same life
[2:20:41] it was the promise
[2:20:43] word
[2:20:44] that was waved over them so it was waved
[2:20:47] over them at the day of pentecost that
[2:20:50] that life could now be in them because i
[2:20:55] live you shall live also
[2:21:00] and then as we just go down so
[2:21:03] he says in the last days now
[2:21:07] because
[2:21:08] that was waved
[2:21:10] at that exodus
[2:21:13] right
[2:21:14] so now we're living in a time
[2:21:17] who are you
[2:21:19] you've been assembled from all kinds of
[2:21:21] different places
[2:21:23] all kinds of different walks of life
[2:21:28] we're gathered in all kinds of places
[2:21:31] all over the world today
[2:21:33] listening
[2:21:35] to the voice
[2:21:39] of the
[2:21:40] angel messenger yes sir to our day
[2:21:45] because
[2:21:47] as we look again at paragraph 92
[2:21:51] and is to be waived again we realize
[2:21:56] in the last days
[2:21:58] according to luke
[2:22:00] 17
[2:22:02] 30.
[2:22:04] so there's a promised wave offering so
[2:22:08] every time that god makes a biblical
[2:22:11] promise
[2:22:12] that promise has to be manifested in the
[2:22:15] flesh
[2:22:17] because in the beginning was the word
[2:22:20] and the word was made
[2:22:22] flesh
[2:22:23] he can never leave a promise
[2:22:27] or a word
[2:22:28] or a prophecy
[2:22:30] unmanifested
[2:22:36] so the way it becomes manifested is to
[2:22:39] become flesh
[2:22:42] and that's what our messenger told us he
[2:22:44] says in the beginning it was the word
[2:22:49] made flesh
[2:22:51] now it's flesh
[2:22:53] being made word
[2:23:00] that's all he says is to be waved over
[2:23:02] the people so the son of man as it was
[2:23:05] in the days
[2:23:08] as it was in the days of moses as it was
[2:23:10] in the days of this coming of the son of
[2:23:12] man
[2:23:13] one shall be taken one shall be left
[2:23:16] so the question is
[2:23:18] and he asked the question was
[2:23:20] who is
[2:23:22] the son of man
[2:23:25] paragraph 93
[2:23:27] who is the son of man
[2:23:30] now we think and say well the son of man
[2:23:32] was brother branham well
[2:23:36] yes and no
[2:23:41] brother branham was the flesh
[2:23:46] that the son of man was manifested in
[2:23:51] but the son of man was the word that was
[2:23:54] in the beginning
[2:23:56] so what the sign was what was the sign
[2:23:58] with moses it was the word made flesh
[2:24:03] what was that was the sign of that
[2:24:04] exodus what was the sign of the second
[2:24:07] exodus jesus the word made flesh
[2:24:12] so there has to be
[2:24:15] the same sign
[2:24:19] has to be the same
[2:24:21] sheaf offering
[2:24:26] when you come to the promised land
[2:24:29] everything has to stay in type
[2:24:33] who is the son of man
[2:24:35] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:24:37] word was with god and the word was made
[2:24:39] flesh
[2:24:41] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:24:43] among us
[2:24:45] so
[2:24:46] brother branham was the vessel
[2:24:51] but the promised word was
[2:24:56] that i will come
[2:24:58] again
[2:25:02] exactly what he did for the gentiles
[2:25:06] he was going to do again
[2:25:10] the same ministry that was that jesus
[2:25:12] christ standing there in flesh the same
[2:25:14] signs the same wonders
[2:25:17] now we just heard them say it right the
[2:25:19] same wonders the same science the same
[2:25:22] works that he done
[2:25:24] have been done again in this day
[2:25:27] because it's a type
[2:25:30] it's a gospel
[2:25:32] he's wanting us to see
[2:25:34] what's transpiring so brother branham
[2:25:36] was the vessel but the word was the
[2:25:39] promise that god made
[2:25:44] that
[2:25:45] i will send you elijah the prophet
[2:25:48] and he shall restore the hearts of the
[2:25:50] children back to the faith of their
[2:25:53] fathers
[2:25:54] in the days of the voice
[2:25:59] of the seventh angel
[2:26:01] the mysteries of god should be revealed
[2:26:04] as it was in the days of sodom and
[2:26:07] gomorrah which we could go an hour on
[2:26:09] that condition
[2:26:11] so shall it be in the day of the son of
[2:26:14] man what was the son of man it's the day
[2:26:19] that the bride
[2:26:21] is
[2:26:22] revealed
[2:26:26] don't get mixed up
[2:26:30] that the son of man ministry
[2:26:32] was just
[2:26:35] turning his back
[2:26:37] to the audience
[2:26:41] and it was just praying for the sick in
[2:26:43] the miracles
[2:26:47] because what the seals done what did we
[2:26:50] say
[2:26:50] is how she was to be revealed in the
[2:26:54] last days
[2:26:55] she's but to be revealed
[2:26:58] by the waving
[2:27:00] of the ministry
[2:27:02] of the son of man
[2:27:04] the ministry of the son of man was the
[2:27:07] revelation
[2:27:09] of the church
[2:27:10] being made flesh
[2:27:13] hallelujah
[2:27:17] it was you
[2:27:19] saying i'm the bride
[2:27:25] i can plant this word
[2:27:28] in my life and it'll mature me
[2:27:32] into rapturing faith
[2:27:36] and there's i can take the word
[2:27:40] that was spoken
[2:27:41] through the mouth of the prophet and the
[2:27:44] revel the revelations that were hid in
[2:27:47] the seals i can take that word plant it
[2:27:51] in my life and it will bring that seed
[2:27:54] in me to full resurrection maturity
[2:28:01] so what was great the event the maturity
[2:28:04] wasn't it it was him taking that life
[2:28:08] at pentecost he says it in paragraph
[2:28:14] he also makes it
[2:28:19] known by the same thing at the day of
[2:28:21] pentecost
[2:28:22] he said paragraph 98 and it was waved to
[2:28:26] them the word which he was
[2:28:29] was waved back to them on the day of
[2:28:32] pentecost
[2:28:35] the word made manifest
[2:28:38] so that's when the promise was made
[2:28:40] manifest you go wait up there
[2:28:44] and tell the promise
[2:28:47] which the father made which i gave you
[2:28:51] and you're endued with power you wait
[2:28:53] there till the promise comes to pass
[2:28:56] so they're in the upper room now the
[2:28:59] sheaf offering is waved over them
[2:29:02] the life
[2:29:03] comes back to them
[2:29:06] did it slip over you
[2:29:11] what happened in our day
[2:29:14] the son of man's waved over us so what
[2:29:17] the life
[2:29:21] he don't care how religious you are
[2:29:25] if you don't get the life
[2:29:28] now everybody's thinking the life is
[2:29:30] what fell at pentecost
[2:29:32] that was not
[2:29:35] what we had in this day
[2:29:38] we had the restoration of gifts
[2:29:41] and an unrighteous partaking
[2:29:44] of spiritual gifts by devil inspired men
[2:29:49] and they produced quote a church
[2:29:53] a bride
[2:29:55] but it's not the bride of christ
[2:29:57] it's the bride of satan
[2:29:59] with all kinds of blasphemous names
[2:30:05] with all kinds of false signs and
[2:30:07] wonders
[2:30:08] but the purpose was not
[2:30:11] to reveal
[2:30:14] was not just to reveal
[2:30:17] the the uh
[2:30:22] what the seals were in the history of it
[2:30:25] but the purpose of it was to reveal the
[2:30:28] bride
[2:30:32] that's what's happening
[2:30:36] it's letting her know i'm bright i'm
[2:30:39] heir to life
[2:30:40] and not only did he that but he waved it
[2:30:43] so you could receive the life
[2:30:49] oh my
[2:30:51] you just think of
[2:30:53] of
[2:30:54] of how glorious
[2:30:56] that is he says now in this day
[2:30:59] he proves what he said
[2:31:02] because they are part of that seed that
[2:31:06] was represented on the lamb's book of
[2:31:09] life
[2:31:10] that he
[2:31:12] came to redeem back to god again
[2:31:16] paragraph 72 oh
[2:31:19] what
[2:31:20] a
[2:31:20] message
[2:31:23] okay so you understand now
[2:31:25] that he's waving the ministry
[2:31:31] of the son of man
[2:31:33] because what did they receive up their
[2:31:36] pentecost they received power
[2:31:39] they were endued with power to make the
[2:31:43] word that he promised him the works that
[2:31:45] i do shall you do also come to life
[2:31:52] and now
[2:31:55] he's waving that same thing over his
[2:31:57] elect
[2:31:59] that they will come
[2:32:02] to life
[2:32:03] i'm speaking to the wife
[2:32:06] what a resurrection this is
[2:32:09] what a resurrection that was
[2:32:12] what a resurrection
[2:32:15] this is
[2:32:18] you're in the rapture
[2:32:20] you're in the resurrection
[2:32:23] you're in the transforming
[2:32:25] it's so beautiful and we'll close i got
[2:32:27] long i know i promised you i would
[2:32:31] and we want to close on this paragraph
[2:32:36] before
[2:32:37] we go
[2:32:38] further
[2:32:40] and and listen close as he says this as
[2:32:44] we who was the son of man
[2:32:46] and then he said luke 17 30 malachi 4 5
[2:32:50] we've seen the different scriptures
[2:32:52] we've seen the signs and wonders we've
[2:32:53] seen this i'm sure you know what i'm
[2:32:55] talking about he's talking about the
[2:32:58] ministry
[2:33:00] the chief offering that was waived over
[2:33:03] the people
[2:33:04] to bring the bride
[2:33:07] to the realization of who that they are
[2:33:11] that they could receive the same life
[2:33:15] that he had
[2:33:18] now i know nobody likes this part
[2:33:22] but i'd just like to close
[2:33:24] he said
[2:33:25] then he said here in paragraph 90
[2:33:29] 7
[2:33:30] because i live
[2:33:33] you live also
[2:33:35] speaking to
[2:33:37] his
[2:33:38] wife
[2:33:42] who was the church
[2:33:43] what
[2:33:45] the church was it was his wife
[2:33:49] he came back to get his eve and this eve
[2:33:53] will not be deceived
[2:33:55] this eve will remain true to that word
[2:33:59] amen and though he says this and he
[2:34:02] closes and we're closing with this
[2:34:04] paragraph too
[2:34:06] paragraph 103
[2:34:10] no matter how
[2:34:11] much
[2:34:13] theologians claim
[2:34:17] i don't care what the baptist says
[2:34:19] i don't care what the presbyterians say
[2:34:22] i don't care what dr schuler says i
[2:34:25] don't certainly don't care what joyce
[2:34:27] meyer says
[2:34:28] i don't care about what any doctor says
[2:34:31] what any seminary says i don't care
[2:34:34] about any man's idea let every man's
[2:34:37] word be a lie i don't care how much they
[2:34:40] take this bible how much they go through
[2:34:43] it how much they explain how much they
[2:34:45] try to tell you that that there's no
[2:34:48] exodus going on
[2:34:53] no matter how they can point to their
[2:34:54] good works
[2:34:58] no matter how much theologians claim
[2:35:04] you got to get that out of your mind
[2:35:06] you'll never get the benefits
[2:35:10] until you've entered that place
[2:35:16] how well you got your church set
[2:35:22] you don't have to have it set
[2:35:24] everything's set
[2:35:26] i'll tell you something about christians
[2:35:30] christians don't live by plans
[2:35:34] that's right
[2:35:35] they're led by the spirit of god
[2:35:38] how are you going to do this i don't
[2:35:40] know
[2:35:41] do you got a plan not really
[2:35:46] what do you think
[2:35:49] noah's plan look like
[2:35:55] no
[2:35:56] every day god said put this here pitch
[2:35:58] that there put that there
[2:36:00] we're led
[2:36:03] we're not a planned church we're a
[2:36:05] miracle church
[2:36:07] the footsteps of the righteous are led
[2:36:09] by the lord
[2:36:11] it's by leadership
[2:36:14] we don't know how we're going to do
[2:36:15] things we know one thing if god said so
[2:36:18] he'll take care of it he'll take care of
[2:36:20] it
[2:36:25] that's all our trust is
[2:36:27] we don't go forward by plans we go
[2:36:29] forward by faith
[2:36:32] abraham didn't know what god's plan was
[2:36:38] he knew if god led him to do it he'll do
[2:36:40] it
[2:36:42] whether he had to raise him up from the
[2:36:43] dead he didn't know he didn't have times
[2:36:45] when he was led and when he got there
[2:36:48] god provided a sacrifice hallelujah
[2:36:54] that's what it takes
[2:36:58] you've got to be sold out
[2:37:00] to the vision
[2:37:01] if you're not sold out to the vision
[2:37:04] it'll never come to pass
[2:37:09] you tell me how david brother mike that
[2:37:11] you talk about came from a sheepfold
[2:37:17] beautiful
[2:37:19] because god
[2:37:21] not david
[2:37:23] do you hear brother mike say he said god
[2:37:25] didn't trust in the caves
[2:37:34] he trusted in the fact that he had a
[2:37:35] promise from god
[2:37:37] he had a vision
[2:37:39] he was called
[2:37:41] he didn't know what he had to go through
[2:37:43] yes sir
[2:37:44] but he knew god would get him there
[2:37:47] and even when he fell
[2:37:49] miserably
[2:37:53] and he looked at samuel and he said
[2:37:55] i failed
[2:37:57] he said
[2:37:59] do it unto me
[2:38:01] as i so judged
[2:38:03] he said david
[2:38:06] god's rich in mercy because he chose you
[2:38:10] and he placed you where he placed you
[2:38:13] and he'll stand behind you
[2:38:19] and listen this morning as we say this
[2:38:25] how well you got your church set
[2:38:29] or how much education you got
[2:38:33] how much like the bible
[2:38:40] you know
[2:38:41] i just thrilled there might be what you
[2:38:43] said this morning
[2:38:45] people take this bible
[2:38:49] and they they
[2:38:50] hide in it like one of those caves
[2:38:56] i'm a red letter king james believe in
[2:38:58] baptist yes
[2:39:03] or you get with a person that's in the
[2:39:04] church of christ
[2:39:06] their whole life is to argue
[2:39:12] when they're arguing they're on fire
[2:39:15] that's their holy ghost
[2:39:18] because the spirit of argument
[2:39:20] we're the church of christ
[2:39:22] we don't play pianos we don't have music
[2:39:25] we don't sing we don't do this we don't
[2:39:27] do that we're the church of christ
[2:39:30] we we're we're right here we
[2:39:32] by works and we're right down here like
[2:39:34] this
[2:39:38] you know armenians and
[2:39:40] and you know camelites we don't want to
[2:39:43] get into that philosophy
[2:39:44] but they're on both sides of this and
[2:39:46] they're hiding in this word
[2:39:48] and and they got their scriptures and
[2:39:50] they're throwing out the defense out
[2:39:52] there and they've got it all together
[2:39:54] and if you get to follow them you'll go
[2:39:56] down their rabbit trail
[2:39:59] and knowing you to get to the end of it
[2:40:01] you've got no life
[2:40:04] that's what he said i don't care how
[2:40:06] much you got
[2:40:07] without the life it's nothing
[2:40:10] now list what he says
[2:40:11] he says
[2:40:16] how much education you got
[2:40:19] how much like the bible and tell
[2:40:22] that wave chief
[2:40:27] and tell the ministry
[2:40:30] of malachi 4 5
[2:40:32] luke 17 30. revelations 10 7 is waived
[2:40:37] over you
[2:40:41] until that comes into your life
[2:40:44] and has waved over you
[2:40:48] there is no way
[2:40:50] you'll come to maturity
[2:40:52] there is no way you'll come to
[2:40:54] resurrection until the holy spirit comes
[2:40:57] upon that person to quicken
[2:41:00] that
[2:41:01] word
[2:41:04] until that's waved
[2:41:06] there's no way the seed that's in you
[2:41:09] can come to life
[2:41:12] and the only people that are gonna come
[2:41:14] to life or that bride is the church
[2:41:18] this is not a great big world full of
[2:41:21] christians
[2:41:24] the prophet of god said it's
[2:41:28] denominational fiction
[2:41:31] if you're living outside of revelations
[2:41:34] 10 7 luke 17 30 and malachi 4 and the
[2:41:38] revealed word of the hour you are living
[2:41:40] in a fiction and you'll never mature
[2:41:45] and come to life
[2:41:49] i know that's cold
[2:41:53] what is the biggest word you hear today
[2:41:56] inclusion
[2:41:59] let's include anybody
[2:42:03] some guy thinks he's a woman we'll
[2:42:04] include her on the swim team
[2:42:09] some guy all decides he's a lady he can
[2:42:11] go in the woman's bathroom
[2:42:14] we include everybody
[2:42:17] christianity
[2:42:18] is not inclusion it's exclusion
[2:42:26] and anybody that's not under the
[2:42:29] ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 the
[2:42:34] sheaf offering in this day is excluded
[2:42:38] out of the resurrection
[2:42:44] no that's back
[2:42:45] wait a minute
[2:42:47] we need more grace so let's start let's
[2:42:50] just what do they call that
[2:42:51] when you sign a contract and then at the
[2:42:54] bottom they got all the fine print
[2:42:57] i got a contract the other day and there
[2:43:00] was more things inside that are excluded
[2:43:03] there was in the things that they're
[2:43:04] doing
[2:43:08] disclaimer
[2:43:10] yeah we want to write a disclaimer oh
[2:43:13] whoever god picks
[2:43:17] well he picked you
[2:43:21] if he would have picked them he would
[2:43:23] have given them the revelation he gave
[2:43:24] you
[2:43:27] god knows who he picked
[2:43:29] my sheep hear my voice
[2:43:31] and another they will not follow all
[2:43:34] that the father hath given me will come
[2:43:37] i will not leave them nor forsake them
[2:43:40] if i start a good work in them i'll
[2:43:42] finish it till the end
[2:43:44] i don't know who they are
[2:43:47] as far as individuals but i know the
[2:43:50] only ones that are going is his elect
[2:43:53] lady
[2:43:54] she's the only one that doesn't go in
[2:43:56] the tribulation because he will not let
[2:43:59] his bride go in the tribulation and he
[2:44:02] brings his bride to life
[2:44:04] how is she revealed in the last days
[2:44:08] she's revealed by the ministry of the
[2:44:10] son of man being waved over her and
[2:44:13] bringing her to life
[2:44:17] nothing else
[2:44:22] this kills
[2:44:26] but the spirit
[2:44:28] brings this
[2:44:30] to life
[2:44:32] oh what a beautiful
[2:44:35] revelation
[2:44:37] that we're living under
[2:44:39] please church

[2:44:43] no matter how evil and mad you are
[2:44:47] at your flesh in your life
