[52:08] Hallelujah Lord bless you this morning
[52:12] uh we're we're going to just start this
[52:14] morning um with uh we're going to read
[52:18] uh
[52:20] uh a passage from Psalm but we're going
[52:23] to let uh our our Prophet read that to
[52:26] us
[52:27] and if you turn in your Bibles to Psalm
[52:30] 42 and uh I don't
[52:34] exactly uh uh but you're very familiar
[52:38] uh with the scripture I believe it's the
[52:41] second verse so we're going to turn to
[52:44] Psalm
[52:45] 42 uh we'll uh we're going to listen to
[52:48] just a few
[52:50] moments uh of a message called thirst
[52:53] and we're using this as part of our
[52:56] Foundation to share with you uh what's
[53:00] on our heart this morning so we trust
[53:03] that the Lord will uh speak to each of
[53:05] our hearts uh our our theme I express to
[53:10] you is uh we want to uh have a path
[53:14] forward amen we're not leaving that
[53:17] thought we want to have a path
[53:19] forward and we want to grow together uh
[53:23] closer to one another as a body
[53:27] so we want to gather up the Loose Ends
[53:31] and and pull all in for one goal and one
[53:35] Accord that the Lord will richly bless
[53:38] us so we'll just listen to a just a very
[53:41] few moments of this message thirst uh
[53:45] it's uh really pretty tremendous message
[53:49] when I begin to read it and see what was
[53:52] in it but we're just going to start just
[53:54] on a small portion of of it this morning
[53:57] so after brother brandom reads the
[53:59] scripture uh uh feel uh free to take
[54:04] your seat God bless you as we start our
[54:07] morning now Psalms uh
[54:12] 42 as the heart
[54:18] paintthe my soul after thee Oh God my
[54:22] soul thirst for God for the Living God
[54:26] When shall I come and appear before God
[54:31] my tears have been my meat day and night
[54:35] while I while they continually say unto
[54:38] me where is thy
[54:41] God I think David in the writing of this
[54:46] Psalm must have been in
[54:49] distress and it usually takes distress
[54:51] to bring the best out of a man it really
[54:56] uh that's when God gets down to when we
[55:00] fast many times to get herself in
[55:02] position to get herself out of the way
[55:04] and I think when David got in these
[55:07] places then he began to meditate on the
[55:11] Lord begin to think about the things
[55:13] many times God gets us in in tight
[55:16] Corners where we have to look up
[55:19] sometimes we even have to get on our
[55:20] back in the hospital or a bed somewhere
[55:23] so we can look up to see where the great
[55:26] blessings of God comes from now the word
[55:29] I want to speak from tonight one word
[55:31] out of the Bible and that is found in
[55:34] the second verse uh
[55:36] thirst the word of thirst I was looking
[55:40] in the dictionary when I was uh looking
[55:42] up this word I was thinking about a
[55:44] sermon one time I preached on um
[55:47] thirsting after life and uh tuck it out
[55:50] of the Psalms too when David said thy
[55:53] statues I believe are more precious to
[55:55] me than life and I was looking and
[55:57] thinking about that word thirst so I
[55:59] looked up in the dictionary to see what
[56:00] it means and here's what Webster says
[56:03] it's a painful desire a painful when you
[56:08] want something so bad until it becomes
[56:11] painful to
[56:12] you uh now that's uh it's not a
[56:18] unnatural thing to thirst thirst is a a
[56:22] natural thing it's just simply something
[56:24] that God has given us that we could U to
[56:27] give us a a desire for something
[56:31] sometimes God has uh also has given you
[56:35] a a control tower something that sets
[56:38] inside of you that that controls these
[56:41] different desires and this uh thirst
[56:45] this control tower that sits in a man's
[56:48] heart is something that God giving to to
[56:52] warnning of the desires that's needful
[56:55] for him now there is two different kinds
[56:59] of thirst there is a thirst physically
[57:02] and there is a thirst Also spiritually I
[57:05] would like to read this what David said
[57:07] again my soul thirst for God for the
[57:11] Living God not some historical or some
[57:16] something that happened some years ago
[57:18] or or some tale that someone told but
[57:22] for the Living God a God that's ever
[57:25] present
[57:27] and his soul thirsted for that God not
[57:31] for some historical something now we
[57:33] find God gives the control tower to you
[57:37] to give to you the things that you need
[57:42] now the control tower in you is what
[57:44] directs you and this thirst runs in on
[57:47] this C to uh control tower and tells you
[57:49] what you have need of spiritually
[57:51] speaking the control tower in the body
[57:54] and in the soul also
[57:56] there's a control tower in the body that
[57:59] tells you the need that's needed in your
[58:02] body and it's brought to you by thirst
[58:06] also there's a control tower in your
[58:08] soul that tells you the spiritual things
[58:11] that you have need of something in your
[58:14] spirit and and You by this can tell what
[58:18] kind of a life is controlling you when
[58:21] you uh when you can see what your
[58:23] desires are then you can tell but that
[58:28] what kind of something it's in you
[58:30] that's creating this desire that you
[58:33] have see there's a certain thing that
[58:35] you thirst for and it and it can tell
[58:38] you in your soul what this desire is by
[58:41] the nature of The Thirst that you have I
[58:44] hope that's you can understand that
[58:47] there is a a control tower of the soul
[58:50] and one for the body and each Tower is a
[58:53] warning caller for the need needs of the
[58:57] other each one calls to the Need For
[59:01] What the caller is calling for it sends
[59:03] out a wave of warning for instance the
[59:07] the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires
[59:11] that's in the body and the Spirit uh
[59:15] desires for the things that's in the
[59:17] soul desire is and many times these War
[59:22] one against the other we find there
[59:26] what's the a great trouble today that
[59:29] too many people uh try to live between
[59:34] those two desires for one of them
[59:37] desires the things of the Earth the
[59:40] other desires the things of Heaven like
[59:42] Paul said describes this in Romans 7:21
[59:45] when I would do good then evil is not
[59:49] when you try did you ever have that in
[59:52] experienc Christians that when you're
[59:54] trying to do something that's worthwhile
[59:57] go to make an effort to do something
[59:59] that's good then you find out that there
[1:00:02] is a devil on every hand just to upset
[1:00:05] you everything that you and that's one
[1:00:07] good thing that I'd like to say this and
[1:00:12] the Christians might know that when
[1:00:15] you're when you're starting to do
[1:00:18] something and there's something always
[1:00:20] trying to upset you in doing it do it
[1:00:23] anyhow that's the devil they're trying
[1:00:25] to keep you from doing what's right now
[1:00:28] many times I meet people that's prone to
[1:00:31] be a little nervous when they find out
[1:00:34] that they're trying to do something and
[1:00:36] and everything's just blocking it off on
[1:00:38] both sides and say it might not been the
[1:00:40] will of the Lord see uh don't let the
[1:00:43] devil lie to you like that the first
[1:00:45] thing is find out whether it's the will
[1:00:48] of God or not and then if you want to
[1:00:51] know where's the will of God look into
[1:00:53] the Bible there is a thing that's that
[1:00:57] sets you straight is the word of God and
[1:01:00] then if you see it's in the word of God
[1:01:02] for you to do it like for instance
[1:01:05] seeking for the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost many times I've run into people
[1:01:09] say well I sought for the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:12] I just couldn't receive it I don't
[1:01:14] believe it's for me every time I get
[1:01:16] down I get sick and I go to praying if I
[1:01:19] fast it gets sick and if I try to uh
[1:01:22] stay all night I say I get so sleepy I I
[1:01:25] can't get off my feet remember that is
[1:01:27] the devil because God intends for you to
[1:01:30] have the Holy Spirit it's for whosoever
[1:01:33] will many times you find when you're
[1:01:36] prayed for in a meeting for Divine
[1:01:38] Healing then the next day you find out
[1:01:41] no doubt that the devil will make that
[1:01:43] twice as bad as it was the day before
[1:01:46] see remember that's just Satan trying to
[1:01:49] get you away from the blessing that
[1:01:50] God's got for you don't you listen to
[1:01:53] that fell see always press right on I
[1:01:57] had an experience of that just recently
[1:01:59] on the road to Africa if I ever had any
[1:02:02] time that the devil ever did press at me
[1:02:05] was to go to Africa this last time and
[1:02:07] become one of the the finest meetings
[1:02:10] and times that I ever went overseas I
[1:02:13] got I believe more things accomplished
[1:02:15] in that little time that I was there
[1:02:17] besides my hunting trip than I ever did
[1:02:20] at any time I always thought that those
[1:02:23] churches didn't want me there and come
[1:02:25] to find out I had a letter from someone
[1:02:27] that it was U oh they didn't want me
[1:02:29] there all the association and found out
[1:02:31] it was one man with a letter head from
[1:02:34] an organization that said we don't want
[1:02:37] you he meant him and his family see so
[1:02:40] then when I got over there see just we
[1:02:43] that was he and his family and it wasn't
[1:02:45] the people at all so now it's a great
[1:02:48] Field open up for us to see what Paul
[1:02:50] said when I would do good then evil is
[1:02:53] not you let a young convert come tonight
[1:02:56] to the altar somewhere here in this
[1:02:58] Tabernacle or or out Across the Nation
[1:03:01] and just remember tomorrow mother will
[1:03:04] be more Angry than she ever was dad will
[1:03:07] be all upset and all the school kids and
[1:03:09] everything just goes wrong because it's
[1:03:12] Satan trying to get you to turn around
[1:03:14] he's trying to run you off the path when
[1:03:17] I would do good then evil is always not
[1:03:21] now let us look at the thirst and let's
[1:03:24] see whether uh actually thirst is a
[1:03:26] natural thing I've had people to tell me
[1:03:29] oh I never did I believe it's just far
[1:03:31] some people to want to be Christians oh
[1:03:33] all that's wrong it's actually a
[1:03:36] something that's associated with every
[1:03:38] human being it certainly is true when we
[1:03:41] come to this country in the early days
[1:03:43] we found the Indians here and the
[1:03:46] Indians though they were Heathen at that
[1:03:48] time they worship the son or something
[1:03:51] as long as they are human there's
[1:03:55] something in them a natural thirst
[1:03:57] calling out for God
[1:04:00] somewhere back in the jungles just
[1:04:02] recently back there uh 480 miles from
[1:04:05] the coast this civilization a little
[1:04:07] small town of about 3,000 people of
[1:04:10] Barra and mosm Beek we found natives
[1:04:13] that didn't even never seen a white
[1:04:15] person I found a native girl she had no
[1:04:19] clothes on any of them harly have
[1:04:21] clothes on and she was sitting up in a
[1:04:23] tree and I was tracking a line and there
[1:04:25] was I heard something like a human being
[1:04:27] screaming this native girl sitting up
[1:04:29] there walyed holding a baby and what she
[1:04:33] was scared about that your only
[1:04:35] protection is get up a tree from a lion
[1:04:37] leopard or something or some animal and
[1:04:40] she'd see me and heard it was a human
[1:04:43] being but when she looked and seen a
[1:04:44] white person she had never seen one in
[1:04:46] her life see and she was scared to death
[1:04:49] see but when we find those people even
[1:04:52] in that primitive condition back there
[1:04:54] they were still
[1:04:56] worshiping before we called a lion in
[1:04:59] they poured out some me meal that's what
[1:05:01] they eat on a little leaf and clap their
[1:05:03] hands and called on the spirit of some
[1:05:06] great something they didn't know where
[1:05:08] like a patron saint or something to a
[1:05:10] Catholic to protect them that they
[1:05:12] wouldn't be uh killed during the time of
[1:05:15] the charge of this line see it's
[1:05:18] something
[1:05:19] natural it's not an unnatural thing to
[1:05:22] thirst for God it's a natural thing
[1:05:26] it's just something that you should do
[1:05:28] God has made you up like that and it's
[1:05:31] no superhuman it's just actually a
[1:05:34] common human being it ain't just special
[1:05:37] for some
[1:05:45] people we're just uh wanting to uh lay a
[1:05:51] a little Foundation uh this morning for
[1:05:55] the thing things that we uh are Desiring
[1:05:59] to uh share with you so uh uh we want to
[1:06:04] do that so I i' also see if I've I've
[1:06:08] got him here uh I I wanted to also uh
[1:06:14] read to you a uh a few statements that
[1:06:19] are our messenger made and I'm going to
[1:06:22] build uh to a little something so uh if
[1:06:25] you would uh bear with me and help me uh
[1:06:29] go along and pull a little bit When the
[1:06:32] Thought uh comes along so we we realize
[1:06:37] that we've talked
[1:06:40] before uh and we want to establish this
[1:06:44] that God was the original maker of
[1:06:48] man so you you when we understand that
[1:06:53] that that everything that God put in man
[1:06:58] he put in man when he made Man In His
[1:07:01] Image and likeness so he said every seed
[1:07:06] when God made a seed he made that seed
[1:07:11] he put all the fruit and everything that
[1:07:15] was in that seed he put that that was in
[1:07:19] the seed so you take a corn seed and all
[1:07:23] those seeds you might put several
[1:07:26] different kind of seeds out there
[1:07:28] they're all small little seeds and uh
[1:07:32] the scripture even refers to the Mustard
[1:07:34] Seed how it was just a very small seed
[1:07:39] but in that seed God had placed in that
[1:07:43] seed what it was going to become and the
[1:07:48] fruit that it was going to
[1:07:51] produce and and so when we we begin to
[1:07:55] understand these principles and so God's
[1:08:00] the Creator Satan is the
[1:08:03] perverter and so when God you saw the
[1:08:06] seed so if you saw a corn seed or a
[1:08:09] wheat seed and you plant that seed it it
[1:08:12] doesn't just come up a a
[1:08:16] seed in that seed was a a a a little
[1:08:20] stock a little a blade that came up and
[1:08:24] then it moved into a stock and it and it
[1:08:27] grew higher and then it formed a ear and
[1:08:32] uh uh I don't know why they call it a
[1:08:34] ear it looks more like a nose to me but
[1:08:37] uh maybe they don't call it a nose of
[1:08:39] corn but they it it's a they call it a
[1:08:42] ear of corn it produces a corn and it
[1:08:45] wraps itself with a a shock and and
[1:08:49] you've got to peel it back to get to the
[1:08:52] the back to the original Fruit
[1:08:55] uh that was planted it's it's so many uh
[1:08:59] types of that the wheat and the shuck
[1:09:02] and the sermons that we have about the
[1:09:06] wheat the wheat and and the Shu so when
[1:09:10] we begin to understand that God put a
[1:09:13] thirst in
[1:09:16] men so in other words that thirst was
[1:09:19] created in man God we just heard him say
[1:09:23] that that that thirst was created ated
[1:09:25] in man and to take care of the natural
[1:09:28] thirst is to take care of the natural
[1:09:30] man the spiritual thirst is to take care
[1:09:34] of the spiritual man but he said these
[1:09:36] two work in harmony right they they work
[1:09:40] one towards the other and and so we when
[1:09:44] we begin to come to the understanding
[1:09:49] that that we were made a certain way and
[1:09:54] so I'd like to uh this is from a message
[1:09:57] called uh the union of one God in the
[1:10:02] one church he says you know God has made
[1:10:07] man to
[1:10:09] achieve that's what man was made
[1:10:13] for all down through life he has tried
[1:10:18] to achieve
[1:10:19] something and his achievements the
[1:10:23] reason he TR tries that is because he
[1:10:26] was so designed to do so so I I I want
[1:10:32] you to get that you were designed to
[1:10:35] thirst you were designed to achieve that
[1:10:40] you didn't choose these
[1:10:44] things there there there's a a a drive
[1:10:47] in you that God put there to get better
[1:10:55] you know in other words if if you're
[1:10:58] cold you're going to seek
[1:11:01] shelter you know if you're hungry you're
[1:11:04] going to seek food and maybe uh if if
[1:11:10] you're if you're thirsty as our Prophet
[1:11:13] said then what you want your achievement
[1:11:16] is to quench that
[1:11:19] thirst I mean you so you've got to
[1:11:22] achieve that you've got a a accomplish
[1:11:26] that you've got to perform that you've
[1:11:28] got to reach out to that it it becomes a
[1:11:32] force within you and and you you can try
[1:11:36] to get away from that
[1:11:39] Force but the bum will have to drink
[1:11:44] water he'll seek food he'll seek
[1:11:50] shelter you understand the the the the
[1:11:54] drive to achieve that is within them so
[1:11:58] it's not a bad
[1:12:01] thing you understand it's a good thing
[1:12:04] if God made you that way then it's a
[1:12:06] good thing God does everything perfectly
[1:12:10] and I I'm I'm building to something so I
[1:12:13] just want to we're going to have a
[1:12:15] little bible study this morning to get
[1:12:18] our Focus uh this was on my heart and
[1:12:22] and David Jr preached a wonderful sermon
[1:12:25] uh uh a Wednesday touching on a lot of
[1:12:29] these things that were in my heart so it
[1:12:31] was a blessing and so he he he he says
[1:12:35] this as we read just a little farther
[1:12:38] now in the beginning which is the seed
[1:12:40] chapter of the Bible we find that
[1:12:44] there that in there that when God made
[1:12:47] man he made him in the way that he knew
[1:12:52] that he was to be
[1:12:56] so this thirst this desire to
[1:13:01] achieve God made that way he made you to
[1:13:05] be that way and and I I might as well
[1:13:08] insert this as I try to stay with my
[1:13:11] notes and I always get off but
[1:13:14] Christianity has almost got sometimes to
[1:13:18] try to make it that the man doesn't
[1:13:23] achieve I was raised a a Catholic they
[1:13:26] always preach poverty and and they
[1:13:29] always preach uh you know Penance and
[1:13:33] and de privity God don't want you to
[1:13:35] live that way he wants you to
[1:13:38] achieve he wants you to be
[1:13:43] successful you he made you that that way
[1:13:48] and and we am uh so I I just like to to
[1:13:53] have you make that solid in you just for
[1:13:57] a few seconds this morning and so he put
[1:14:00] it that
[1:14:02] way that he knew how he was to be and
[1:14:06] then he he dropped I'll drop down here a
[1:14:08] little farther and just read this
[1:14:10] statement you can go read these
[1:14:12] paragraphs 17 18 19 20 through there he
[1:14:20] says he says God put he he he said he
[1:14:26] had got it in such a condition till even
[1:14:30] his creator grieved him in his heart
[1:14:33] that he ever made man so it it God got
[1:14:37] to the place that he grieved that he
[1:14:38] ever made man and this what he says he
[1:14:41] ever made man
[1:14:43] you and you can imagine how how God felt
[1:14:49] when he seen the very creature that he
[1:14:52] made in His image and had had given him
[1:14:57] dominion and how that he made him to do
[1:15:02] something for him and yet he turned all
[1:15:06] of his strength and his power over to
[1:15:09] selfish desires and
[1:15:13] achievements so he made him to achieve
[1:15:15] something but then he sought trying to
[1:15:20] achieve the wrong thing he says man's
[1:15:22] always trying to aieve something by his
[1:15:26] head he's supposed to achieve by his
[1:15:29] heart this is paragraph E8 I don't know
[1:15:33] this is from looking to the
[1:15:36] Unseen uh but I I didn't want to get
[1:15:39] involved in just trying to put the
[1:15:40] quotes up I want you to hear the thought
[1:15:45] okay so uh but I want you to let this
[1:15:50] part of it settle in he says but his
[1:15:54] heart that that's a control tower where
[1:15:57] God controlled him and directs his
[1:15:59] thoughts directs his walk directs his
[1:16:02] emotions sometimes I get so happy till I
[1:16:05] get loose and I I look around and see
[1:16:08] somebody and I got my eyes on the people
[1:16:11] but God helped me to keep my eyes closed
[1:16:15] I I want to just be led by the
[1:16:18] spirit of God that the flesh will have
[1:16:23] nothing to do in it
[1:16:25] so we as as we talked to you before now
[1:16:32] we're we're not into a theological
[1:16:35] discussion this morning I'm not going to
[1:16:37] talk about the ministry of the son of
[1:16:40] man how that we know in our day that the
[1:16:45] in order to test the Gentiles that God
[1:16:49] had to give the Gentiles Something to
[1:16:52] Believe on the very same line that he
[1:16:56] gave the Jews to believe in other words
[1:16:59] I'm not going to test your math skills
[1:17:02] by giving one person um uh two plus two
[1:17:07] you know what I mean and that's their
[1:17:09] test and then give another person over
[1:17:12] here E equals
[1:17:15] mc² you know and then say it's a equal
[1:17:19] test that wouldn't if I could say that
[1:17:23] that wouldn't be just
[1:17:26] and so we could we could go into that we
[1:17:29] could go into how Jesus was a man just
[1:17:33] he looked like a man he he would appear
[1:17:36] maybe to be somebody a little taller
[1:17:39] than I am for kind of a little lot
[1:17:41] skinnier than I would be but
[1:17:43] nevertheless you would identify him as a
[1:17:46] man there was nothing about him on the
[1:17:50] outside that would separate you him from
[1:17:54] every everybody
[1:17:56] else but it wasn't until he spoke and it
[1:18:00] wasn't until he
[1:18:02] acted and then like and they said well
[1:18:05] no man could do these things L God be
[1:18:07] with you he spoke like no other man have
[1:18:11] spoken so his
[1:18:13] identity was in what proceeded from him
[1:18:17] and now the test was what was
[1:18:21] that and some people said it was beel up
[1:18:25] other people said it was God no man
[1:18:28] could do these things you know and then
[1:18:31] Jesus asked them who do you say the son
[1:18:34] of man is Thou Art the
[1:18:37] Christ in other words he was saying Thou
[1:18:39] Art the Fulfillment of the scriptures
[1:18:42] Thou Art the Fulfillment of the promise
[1:18:45] this is what our fathers look
[1:18:50] for and that would and now in order to
[1:18:54] be just
[1:18:56] TR to judge the Gentile
[1:18:59] Church in other words all that the
[1:19:02] father's taught in the Old Testament the
[1:19:05] temples all the scribes and all the
[1:19:07] Pharisees everything they taught was
[1:19:10] finally put to the test he said search
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:14] scriptures in them you you say you have
[1:19:17] eternal life but they are which testify
[1:19:20] of me so coming at that time it proved
[1:19:25] everything that was before him that was
[1:19:28] the test of what came before him now in
[1:19:31] order to be
[1:19:33] just The Same
[1:19:35] Spirit that was in Christ
[1:19:38] Jesus had to show up in our
[1:19:42] day in
[1:19:44] flesh in a
[1:19:47] man no different until he
[1:19:52] spoke no there wasn't a guy that spoke
[1:19:55] like he spoke now not everybody thought
[1:19:59] that some people thought he was ignorant
[1:20:01] and unlearned they thought that about
[1:20:07] Jesus but it was the
[1:20:10] test so in the Gentile age we had the
[1:20:14] test God came in human flesh to test
[1:20:19] everything that the church had built
[1:20:22] everything the denominations taught
[1:20:25] everything that they said that they were
[1:20:28] he put God right back in their flesh in
[1:20:31] human flesh doing the same works the
[1:20:34] same signs the same wonders preaching
[1:20:37] the same gospel and what did they do
[1:20:40] they crucified him
[1:20:43] again so this generator was indicted now
[1:20:47] I'm not going down that
[1:20:49] path this
[1:20:52] morning these are things you ought to to
[1:20:55] know we're not going to talk about the
[1:20:57] seals this
[1:20:59] morning how the horse riders went out
[1:21:03] and how Satan disguised himself in four
[1:21:06] horse riders and how he brought the
[1:21:09] church and through four stages of four
[1:21:14] horses four powers the history of his
[1:21:17] poers in the church ages we could break
[1:21:20] the church ages down and show the
[1:21:22] influence of the first church horse in
[1:21:25] these Church ages the second horse rider
[1:21:27] in these Church ages the third horse
[1:21:30] rider in these ages then we could show
[1:21:33] the last horse rider the confusion that
[1:21:36] we've got in the land the pale horse
[1:21:38] rider then we could show the beasts that
[1:21:41] came out the the the lion we could show
[1:21:45] the ox we could show the man how the
[1:21:48] lion went out and and how that that the
[1:21:51] lion was the word of God the battling
[1:21:54] and and then we could show how that the
[1:21:56] ox went out was the Martyr and the
[1:21:58] sacrifice then we could show how the
[1:22:01] next one was the man which was the
[1:22:03] reformers the intellect bringing people
[1:22:06] back and then we could show the
[1:22:08] eag you know these
[1:22:13] things and yet all this Revelation and
[1:22:18] all this knowledge isn't showing up in
[1:22:20] our lives
[1:22:31] you know
[1:22:32] we're it it's you know it's like you
[1:22:36] know the uh the amers you know are just
[1:22:42] starting everything's starting to cool
[1:22:44] down it's just a little heat like the
[1:22:47] flame is is starting to go out of the
[1:22:53] church and
[1:22:55] and and uh there there doesn't seem to
[1:22:58] be uh if I could say it that way there
[1:23:03] doesn't seem to be a lot of
[1:23:06] success or
[1:23:09] achievement and nobody is
[1:23:12] striving for those
[1:23:15] achievements now we know in and this is
[1:23:19] kind of going back if I if you don't
[1:23:21] mind going back with me just for a
[1:23:23] moment and I'm I I I only can only
[1:23:26] preach what God moves me to
[1:23:29] preach and then sometimes I start
[1:23:32] preaching sermons and then I come four
[1:23:34] or five weeks later and I I I see where
[1:23:38] where God was taking
[1:23:42] me and I I'm starting to see when we
[1:23:47] came back when we talked about the two
[1:23:51] puzzles you understand there was there
[1:23:54] were was two pictures two puzzles and so
[1:23:59] the one puzzle had a picture and another
[1:24:02] puzzle had a picture but nobody's seen
[1:24:05] the picture of
[1:24:06] God alls we had was the picture of
[1:24:09] Satan's
[1:24:11] Eden so we have this puzzle it's called
[1:24:14] Satan's Eden the God of this evil age
[1:24:19] and we try to fit all of our
[1:24:22] Lives into Satan's
[1:24:26] Kingdom because that had become the
[1:24:30] measure of
[1:24:34] success we measure
[1:24:37] success by what a level of
[1:24:42] achievement we've gained in Satan's
[1:24:45] Eden we measure success in
[1:24:48] dollars we measure success in
[1:24:52] possessions we measure success in
[1:24:56] influence we measure success in power we
[1:25:00] measure success in
[1:25:02] Authority
[1:25:04] position I'm successful because I'm the
[1:25:07] manager of Andy's custard
[1:25:15] store that don't mean
[1:25:18] nothing you talk about you know they say
[1:25:21] Bill Gates I don't know Bill Gates uh uh
[1:25:25] I wish I'd have an opportunity to meet
[1:25:27] him I would tell him he needs to get
[1:25:35] saved you don't think I would oh I'd
[1:25:39] love
[1:25:44] to a lot of talk nowadays about uh uh
[1:25:49] musk and and this person and that person
[1:25:53] and they attribute them to be
[1:26:00] successful they they're a
[1:26:03] billionaire multi-billionaire
[1:26:06] and so we find out that that our Su that
[1:26:11] our
[1:26:12] vision of
[1:26:15] success and and what that what it takes
[1:26:20] to be
[1:26:21] successful uh there brother
[1:26:25] makes this this this statement if if you
[1:26:29] also in this message
[1:26:32] uh see if I open my book to it
[1:26:36] here he says there's also a thirst for
[1:26:41] Success so man's made to achieve he's
[1:26:45] made to succeed he's made to do things
[1:26:49] he says so many people today how we
[1:26:52] school for this
[1:26:54] thirst we start the university up we do
[1:26:58] down spend thousands of dollars to send
[1:27:01] their children to school to universities
[1:27:04] to college and so forth to get an
[1:27:06] education to be what to be
[1:27:10] successful so this it it's not a bad
[1:27:17] thing you understand that and the
[1:27:20] prophet of God divided it there's
[1:27:22] spiritual side and there's a natural
[1:27:24] side it's natural to be
[1:27:30] successful it's it's a a part of it and
[1:27:34] and so they've come
[1:27:36] up
[1:27:38] with so man has a drive in him to be
[1:27:44] successful and so they studied this this
[1:27:48] drive to
[1:27:50] achieve they've studied this thirst
[1:27:55] for
[1:27:56] success and then they stood back and
[1:27:59] they looked at
[1:28:02] people that have
[1:28:04] accomplished what they deem as being
[1:28:11] successful and they say what are the
[1:28:17] practices and the
[1:28:20] habits and the decisions
[1:28:24] of successful
[1:28:29] people so that they do certain
[1:28:34] things okay but now now
[1:28:37] remember the things they're
[1:28:40] doing God put in them to
[1:28:44] do it was in their makeup that's right
[1:28:47] so man begin to
[1:28:50] identify what God had put in them
[1:28:57] their
[1:28:58] drives their patterns their
[1:29:02] decisionmaking the things that they did
[1:29:04] and they begin to categorize them they
[1:29:07] begin to identify them they begin to
[1:29:09] recognize the habits of of those people
[1:29:13] that are successful now the habits and
[1:29:17] everything were in
[1:29:20] there God put them in there man didn't
[1:29:24] put in
[1:29:26] there so it wasn't the
[1:29:29] drive or the
[1:29:35] characteristics the pattern of success
[1:29:39] they took all these successful people
[1:29:42] hundreds of them and all of them had
[1:29:46] certain
[1:29:48] patterns certain things they did
[1:29:54] certain characteristics they followed
[1:29:57] and when they did that they were
[1:30:00] extremely
[1:30:02] successful so it wasn't the pattern that
[1:30:06] was
[1:30:08] wrong it wasn't the decision making that
[1:30:12] was wrong it wasn't the habits that they
[1:30:18] possessed that were wrong what was wrong
[1:30:22] is what they were using
[1:30:27] for cuz Satan's a
[1:30:33] perverter now I'm saying this because we
[1:30:35] we want to be
[1:30:37] spiritually
[1:30:40] successful so what did Satan
[1:30:43] do he changed the
[1:30:48] object he changed the
[1:30:51] meaning of success
[1:30:56] Jesus was trying to
[1:30:58] re
[1:31:00] reestablish the meaning of success
[1:31:03] because he knew that man had all these
[1:31:06] characteristics in there put in there by
[1:31:11] God and God made him to
[1:31:17] achieve am
[1:31:18] I clear this morning
[1:31:24] you know like I said I'm not preaching
[1:31:25] to the internet today I don't care if we
[1:31:28] have another technical failure that's
[1:31:31] fine with
[1:31:32] me I'm interested in
[1:31:35] you you that are sitting here this
[1:31:38] morning I want you to reach your full
[1:31:42] potential I want you to be everything
[1:31:45] that God made you to
[1:31:48] be and I want you to take back from
[1:31:51] Satan what's yours
[1:32:00] so Satan takes all these
[1:32:03] characteristics all these things in man
[1:32:06] that God put there to make man achieve
[1:32:09] The Thirst the desire to achieve the
[1:32:12] desire to be successful he perverts them
[1:32:16] so that man's me meaning of success his
[1:32:20] measurement of success is all those are
[1:32:22] all wrong
[1:32:26] Satan changed the
[1:32:33] goal he made the wrong
[1:32:36] achievement so now he takes
[1:32:40] possession of
[1:32:47] achievement
[1:32:49] sure he takes possession of achievement
[1:32:54] he takes possession of
[1:32:58] success he takes possession of what the
[1:33:02] goal is every
[1:33:06] athlete in order to become a pro they
[1:33:10] all have certain ethics certain work
[1:33:15] habits certain
[1:33:19] mindsets where did they come
[1:33:22] from they came from
[1:33:31] God and what did he do he got the
[1:33:36] Christian to shy
[1:33:41] away from everything that makes you
[1:33:44] successful cuz Satan changed the goal
[1:33:48] the definition the meaning
[1:33:56] it's the
[1:33:58] truth David didn't thirst after
[1:34:02] religion he thirsted after a living
[1:34:07] God a God he could touch a God he could
[1:34:11] labor
[1:34:15] for these men were great
[1:34:19] Achievers
[1:34:21] Abraham
[1:34:22] job all these things were great men were
[1:34:25] great
[1:34:30] Achievers I'm going to read you just a
[1:34:33] few
[1:34:35] items I'm heading in a Direction but I
[1:34:38] hope did you understand those things
[1:34:41] that I
[1:34:42] said right so this is
[1:34:45] just this is just some of the
[1:34:50] characteristics that they they they
[1:34:53] they're now they're saying to be
[1:34:57] successful
[1:34:59] athletes
[1:35:02] businessmen
[1:35:04] Educators everybody that's been
[1:35:06] successful that they could measure all
[1:35:09] had the same
[1:35:12] identifications and
[1:35:14] characteristics and every single one of
[1:35:18] them came from God
[1:35:27] so we say I'm not going to do what he
[1:35:29] does because that's not the
[1:35:33] success I'm trying to
[1:35:37] achieve he stole it from
[1:35:43] you you just aren't trying to achieve
[1:35:46] what they're trying to
[1:35:48] achieve but your way of getting there is
[1:35:52] the same
[1:36:01] hallelujah it's the
[1:36:03] same you got to do the same habits you
[1:36:06] got to do the same practices you've got
[1:36:09] to do the same
[1:36:11] things you won't reach your
[1:36:17] goal without putting in the work
[1:36:23] how many of you hear the guy say well
[1:36:25] you got to put in the
[1:36:26] work you got to put in the work no I'm
[1:36:30] going tocate that's
[1:36:33] religion that's the Catholic
[1:36:35] church I'm going to join and
[1:36:38] go no you're not going to join and
[1:36:49] go you know
[1:36:53] we think oh if I just get the Holy Ghost
[1:36:57] I'm I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:37:00] skate in you know what I mean I I'd like
[1:37:03] to read you something just now that
[1:37:07] I I got to take a moment calm
[1:37:15] down listen to
[1:37:17] this right we're talking about thirsting
[1:37:22] we're talking about feeding Fe ing you
[1:37:25] want to achieve you got to feed
[1:37:29] achievement right if you want to do you
[1:37:32] want to be successful you have to do the
[1:37:35] things that God put in you to be
[1:37:39] successful I'll emphasize it again Satan
[1:37:43] identified those things and perverted it
[1:37:47] for his
[1:37:49] own
[1:37:52] use he looked at Eve what did he offer
[1:37:55] her oh if you partake of this you will
[1:38:01] be
[1:38:04] successful you will achieve you will
[1:38:08] become like
[1:38:13] God why he couldn't have pulled that on
[1:38:20] Adam so he pulled it on the
[1:38:24] bride he couldn't pull it on
[1:38:31] Jesus but he's trying to pull it
[1:38:35] on the
[1:38:40] bride so here he he's got
[1:38:43] her listen what he says listen to this
[1:38:47] paragraph 180 in
[1:38:52] thirst he said says you
[1:38:54] neglect to Milk The
[1:38:57] Cow when the cow is when the utter is
[1:39:00] full of
[1:39:03] milk and if you let that cow stay like
[1:39:06] that she'll go
[1:39:09] dry that's exactly right if you
[1:39:13] neglect to take a drink of
[1:39:17] water I just ain't going to drink
[1:39:19] anymore you'll die if you neglect
[1:39:24] to eat food you'll
[1:39:29] die this is so
[1:39:33] profound so if you neglect to give the
[1:39:38] Holy Spirit the word of God you'll
[1:39:47] die who ever thought we had to feed the
[1:39:50] Holy Spirit
[1:39:54] but if you don't give this that unction
[1:39:58] that spirit that that that move if you
[1:40:02] don't give it the word of God it'll
[1:40:09] die it might go off into some great
[1:40:13] big
[1:40:15] thing but it'll
[1:40:17] die spiritual moves without the word of
[1:40:21] God die I don't care where they are I
[1:40:24] don't care who their preachers are
[1:40:26] that's thus saith the
[1:40:32] Lord they
[1:40:35] die doesn't have to do with the
[1:40:38] person the
[1:40:39] personality the goodness it's a fact
[1:40:45] just like your desire to achieve is a
[1:40:49] fact the characteristics that God put in
[1:40:53] you to achieve are a fact they're not
[1:40:57] attributed to man they're not attributed
[1:41:00] to psychology they're not attributed to
[1:41:04] life
[1:41:05] coaches they've been there all the
[1:41:09] time are you with

[1:43:04] that they protect their
[1:43:10] Sunday they pick three things to do
[1:43:14] every
[1:43:19] day
[1:43:21] they they adapt to what the presents
[1:43:28] hold so they deal with what's
[1:43:31] happening not behind or ahead I want you
[1:43:36] as I read these things in your mind I
[1:43:40] want you to start attaching
[1:43:47] scriptures okay because what that's what
[1:43:50] I'm trying to show you this morning that
[1:43:53] all these characteristics of success God
[1:43:57] put in
[1:44:05] you it it it says
[1:44:13] uh it it say another thing they do here
[1:44:16] I'll just read them try to read them
[1:44:18] quicker
[1:44:21] de uh de
[1:44:24] we
[1:44:26] prioritize opportunities which don't fit
[1:44:28] your goals in other words don't seek
[1:44:32] after things that don't
[1:44:37] fit make a list of goals for
[1:44:42] improvement listen and
[1:44:45] learn put in extra effort to stay
[1:44:51] organized do all things things decent
[1:44:54] and in order just the scripture pay
[1:44:57] attention to detail keep a Daily Journal
[1:45:01] but do it right
[1:45:03] away how many know brother Ram kept a
[1:45:08] journal do you know
[1:45:10] that he kept all his visions and all his
[1:45:15] dreams check your pride at the door
[1:45:18] never give up surround yourself with
[1:45:21] positive people
[1:45:23] remove fear unplug without a device
[1:45:26] those those are just some of the things
[1:45:29] there are seven other things that a a a
[1:45:34] different list
[1:45:36] has now what I want to do for a few
[1:45:38] moments because I want you to establish
[1:45:40] that every single one of those things
[1:45:43] that I've
[1:45:45] read They're scripture
[1:45:49] form they are scriptural
[1:45:57] practices The Book of
[1:46:01] Proverbs is a whole book of
[1:46:05] successful
[1:46:08] practices Solomon was teaching his
[1:46:10] children how to be
[1:46:13] successful in life and business and in
[1:46:18] re and naturally physically and
[1:46:22] spiritually
[1:46:25] so I'm going to just take a few I'm
[1:46:28] going to take
[1:46:29] 10 of these
[1:46:33] characteristics that are in
[1:46:37] you that God put
[1:46:40] there and try to attach some scripture
[1:46:43] to
[1:46:45] them because I'm tired of
[1:46:50] Satan deceiving us
[1:46:53] so he says all these successful
[1:46:56] practices all these things that I've
[1:47:00] taken and I've taught all my people that
[1:47:06] they can achieve Great Heights in my
[1:47:12] Eden and they say they're mine and I'm
[1:47:15] saying no they're not I can do these
[1:47:18] same
[1:47:20] things these same practice
[1:47:23] practices but I can do them for a
[1:47:26] different
[1:47:28] Kingdom a different Eden and I can be
[1:47:32] just as successful in my
[1:47:36] world as they are in their
[1:47:40] world because these two worlds are
[1:47:43] coming to a
[1:47:45] showdown and we just heard our Prophet
[1:47:48] say you can't get stuck in between the
[1:47:52] two control
[1:47:57] Towers you can't
[1:48:00] confuse the
[1:48:02] message
[1:48:04] amen we do all the same things that they
[1:48:07] do for a different
[1:48:09] purpose for a different
[1:48:12] achievement for a different
[1:48:15] result but we're doing the same things
[1:48:17] they do to get rich we do the same
[1:48:20] things to get rich that's right
[1:48:23] he said The Thirst is on both sides
[1:48:25] natural and spiritual the same things
[1:48:28] they do to reach to reach Fame to we re
[1:48:33] we do the same things to reach a good
[1:48:40] testimony but the the the
[1:48:43] method is the
[1:48:46] same it's just two different
[1:48:50] roads two different goals and when you
[1:48:53] get those
[1:48:59] confused when when you get when when it
[1:49:02] it becomes a
[1:49:03] blur that's lady OA
[1:49:10] lukewarm all of it is
[1:49:13] yours every good and perfect thing comes
[1:49:18] from the father
[1:49:19] above if you have your bibles if the
[1:49:22] brothers could keep up with
[1:49:24] me one of the first characteristics that
[1:49:27] they
[1:49:28] found with every single person they
[1:49:33] studied thousands of
[1:49:36] millionaires
[1:49:38] billionaires
[1:49:40] athletes this one characteristic stood
[1:49:44] up they wake up
[1:49:51] early Mark 1
[1:50:02] 35 I don't know if you guys can find
[1:50:04] that as quick as we can uh and in the
[1:50:08] morning rising up a great while before
[1:50:12] day he went out and departed
[1:50:16] into a a solitary place and there prayed
[1:50:24] if if we read John 8
[1:50:34] and2 I I would have marked all these out
[1:50:37] but can you find John 8 and2 and early
[1:50:41] in the morning he came again to the
[1:50:43] temple and all the people came unto him
[1:50:46] and sat down and taught them the another
[1:50:51] scripture it says that he he woke up
[1:50:53] early in the morning which was his
[1:51:00] custom oh I want to be successful get
[1:51:09] up wake
[1:51:12] up the the uh Proverbs uh 31 and 15
[1:51:26] she riseth also it is yet night and
[1:51:31] giveth meat to her household and a
[1:51:34] portion to her
[1:51:38] maidens oh
[1:51:41] man I got to get up and cook breakfast
[1:51:44] you want to be
[1:51:45] successful get
[1:51:49] up I'm not even going to read all the
[1:51:52] scriptures is about a
[1:51:55] sluggard let's just read Proverbs
[1:52:04] 31:15 that was good
[1:52:09] Brothers oh that I've already gave that
[1:52:12] one okay let's let's go to uh Psalms
[1:52:18] 1438 just a
[1:52:20] few there was 50 or 60 on this one thing
[1:52:24] cause me to hear thy loving kindness in
[1:52:28] the morning for in thee do I trust cause
[1:52:33] me to Know Thy ways wherein I should
[1:52:35] walk for I lift up my soul unto
[1:52:40] thee in the
[1:52:43] morning why do you start up wake up
[1:52:46] early to start your day right you'll
[1:52:49] never be successful waiting till 8:30 in
[1:52:53] the morning to tear out of the house to
[1:52:56] get your job at 8:00 you will never be
[1:53:02] successful cuz God put it in you to wake
[1:53:07] up
[1:53:08] early now I'm not going to go into the
[1:53:10] rare occasions you start work at this
[1:53:13] early is
[1:53:16] early number two they all
[1:53:20] do read
[1:53:28] more read more how many knew the prophet
[1:53:31] of God was a
[1:53:35] reader Psalms 119
[1:53:42] 105 Thy word is a lamp under my feet and
[1:53:47] a light unto my
[1:53:51] path
[1:53:53] Psalm
[1:53:58] 11918 open th my eyes that I might
[1:54:02] behold wondrous things out of thy
[1:54:07] law that's what they
[1:54:10] read just just Proverbs 15 and 15 and
[1:54:19] four a wholesome tongue is a the tree of
[1:54:25] life but perverseness therein is a
[1:54:28] breach of the Spirit uh that was no I'm
[1:54:31] sorry Romans 15 and4 that's still
[1:54:36] good that comes under a different
[1:54:40] category so what soever things were
[1:54:44] written a four time were written for
[1:54:49] our
[1:54:50] learning that we through patience and
[1:54:54] comfort of the scriptures might have
[1:55:02] hope
[1:55:04] read
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:08] more you say I
[1:55:11] listen listening is a whole different
[1:55:15] characteristic listen and
[1:55:17] learn read more I'm not going to go into
[1:55:22] the psychology of reading but when you
[1:55:25] read it you can write it on your heart
[1:55:28] every single guy that ever was
[1:55:30] successful he writes down what his
[1:55:33] thought
[1:55:35] is prophet of God said a sermon came to
[1:55:37] me I wrote it
[1:55:44] down oh we want you want to skate
[1:55:47] in no skating in here we're done with
[1:55:51] skating
[1:55:55] you show up to church at 10:00 and can't
[1:55:58] come early you you you you don't show up
[1:56:00] to work that
[1:56:02] way it shows what your thirst
[1:56:05] is it identifies
[1:56:12] you
[1:56:14] acts 17 and
[1:56:20] 11 these were more Noble than those in
[1:56:24] thessalonia in that they received the
[1:56:27] word with all Readiness of mind and
[1:56:32] searched the Scriptures Daily whether
[1:56:36] those things were
[1:56:42] so so here they're over there
[1:56:45] saying read
[1:56:48] more that wasn't they didn't come up
[1:56:50] with that it was in in the
[1:56:54] scriptures why was it in the scriptures
[1:56:57] because God put it in man to hunger and
[1:57:01] thirst after
[1:57:05] righteousness everything they're doing
[1:57:07] to get rich in the world are the things
[1:57:09] we do to get rich in
[1:57:14] Christ second Timothy
[1:57:17] 2:15 I think that study to show yourself
[1:57:20] approved I'm not
[1:57:22] yeah study to show thyself approved unto
[1:57:25] God a Workman needeth not to be ashamed
[1:57:28] rightly dividing the word of truth that
[1:57:31] that's one okay you know the I'm not
[1:57:34] going to go a long time into this one
[1:57:36] take care of your
[1:57:39] body exercise they
[1:57:43] say prophet of God always preached about
[1:57:45] high breed food what it was doing to
[1:57:50] us that's the one we think we can get
[1:57:52] away
[1:57:54] with there's a lot of other things we
[1:57:57] can teach there but we we know that the
[1:58:00] scripture tells us that we are the
[1:58:02] temple of
[1:58:03] God you know so we won't spend time
[1:58:07] there
[1:58:12] self-focus take a look at
[1:58:15] yourself David said I lay on my bed and
[1:58:17] I meditate Lord I searcheth all my ways
[1:58:23] there's there's there's scripture after
[1:58:25] scripture that you'll see that these men
[1:58:29] they they they they stopped Jesus taught
[1:58:31] it this way in Matthew uh 7 and5 he said
[1:58:36] remove the
[1:58:39] beam you can put Matthew 7 and5 up there
[1:58:42] he says Thou Hypocrites First cast out
[1:58:45] the beam out of thine own eye then shalt
[1:58:50] thou See Clearly to cast cast out the
[1:58:53] moat of thy brother's eye Jesus is
[1:58:56] teaching this
[1:58:58] self-focus look at yourself first make
[1:59:02] sure there's no hypocrisy in in in
[1:59:05] yourself uh Philippians I believe it is
[1:59:09] four uh six and
[1:59:14] seven be careful for nothing but in
[1:59:18] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:59:21] with Thanksgiving giving let your
[1:59:23] request be known unto God in other words
[1:59:27] these are these are self uh Reflections
[1:59:32] I believe it is Philippians 2 3 and
[1:59:35] 4 there's a lot more of
[1:59:38] them let nothing be done
[1:59:41] through let nothing be done through
[1:59:43] Strife or vain Glory but in lowless of
[1:59:46] mind letting each esteem the other
[1:59:48] better than themselves look not every
[1:59:51] man on on his own thing but every man
[1:59:54] also on the things of others so these
[1:59:57] are these are things that you reflect on
[2:00:00] yourself all these people that were
[2:00:04] successful they did self
[2:00:07] judgment they looked at
[2:00:09] themselves they looked in the
[2:00:13] mirror Jesus said walk a
[2:00:17] mile in another man's
[2:00:20] shoes that's this brotherly kindness
[2:00:24] brother brandom said brotherly kindness
[2:00:27] was to walk a mile in other words think
[2:00:31] of what your brother's feeling look at
[2:00:33] yourself self-focus everybody that was
[2:00:36] successful
[2:00:38] self-focused they to take a minute to
[2:00:40] look at
[2:00:45] themselves we're taught to do
[2:00:48] that right judge yourself
[2:00:52] before you judge another the same
[2:00:55] judgment that you judge yourself by or
[2:00:58] how you judge is how you're going to be
[2:01:03] judged so here you look at somebody and
[2:01:07] you say wow this guy's Rich he's the
[2:01:09] president of the bank how did he get
[2:01:11] there you know how he got there he
[2:01:13] followed the
[2:01:16] scriptures he didn't know he was
[2:01:18] following the scriptures cuz Satan
[2:01:21] robbed it out of the
[2:01:24] scriptures and presented it as
[2:01:28] psychology and
[2:01:30] philosophy and as a method to get to his
[2:01:34] kingdom God wrote him in the
[2:01:39] scriptures for his
[2:01:41] children to become
[2:01:43] Saints and
[2:01:45] pillars in
[2:01:49] Christ despised of the world
[2:01:54] but the crowns of Glory Paul says I'm
[2:01:57] waiting to get the Crown of Glory I've
[2:01:59] ran a good fight i' I I've did the thing
[2:02:01] I've done the work of the Lord I'm
[2:02:07] successful and Jesus says take no
[2:02:10] thought of what you eat or what you
[2:02:13] wear look at The Sparrows look at the
[2:02:17] birds
[2:02:20] everything that man has done to become
[2:02:24] successful they robbed from
[2:02:29] God and they took it out of the
[2:02:31] scriptures because Satan is a
[2:02:37] perverter you can do these very same
[2:02:40] things you can take the self-help book
[2:02:43] you could take the success books every
[2:02:46] single one of them you pick the subject
[2:02:49] ask your Bible where is is this in the
[2:02:52] Bible and scripture after scripture
[2:02:54] after scripture will come out these are
[2:02:57] not
[2:03:01] Secrets Satan stole
[2:03:05] them the their next thing is act
[2:03:09] analytically I'm going to move fast
[2:03:12] now in other words that's
[2:03:16] discernment John 7:24
[2:03:23] judge not according to the
[2:03:26] appearance but judge righteous
[2:03:30] judgment to analyze means to
[2:03:35] discern to look at it pray about it
[2:03:39] don't make quick harsh
[2:03:43] emotional
[2:03:48] decisions first John 4 And1
[2:03:55] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[2:03:59] the spirits whether they are of God
[2:04:02] because many false prophets are gone out
[2:04:04] under the
[2:04:07] world they're teaching this for those
[2:04:10] guys to be successful in the world they
[2:04:13] took them from our Bible they're
[2:04:16] ours we do that but we're not trying to
[2:04:20] get to the same place they are but the
[2:04:25] method was put in Us by God to thirst
[2:04:31] after the things of God to do these
[2:04:36] things for the kingdom of God what
[2:04:38] they're doing for the world we do for
[2:04:42] God they wake up early to get a head
[2:04:45] start we wake up
[2:04:48] early they read more we read more for
[2:04:51] for a different reason they get up they
[2:04:53] read the market they read the tick or
[2:04:55] tape they they do all this
[2:04:58] stuff by 9:00 they' they've accomplished
[2:05:02] three or four
[2:05:04] things they've got all the cobwebs out
[2:05:08] they're on fire for
[2:05:10] God 1 Thessalonians 5 and
[2:05:16] 21 prove all things hold fast to that
[2:05:20] which is good
[2:05:25] analytical now I'm asking you are you
[2:05:29] doing these
[2:05:32] things if you sit back and say oh that's
[2:05:35] in the Bible I believe
[2:05:38] that no you've got to be a doer of the
[2:05:44] word not a hearer of the word if you are
[2:05:49] reading these things and not practicing
[2:05:53] them you are suffering from religious
[2:05:59] fantasy the scripture says go the extra
[2:06:03] mile if your brother ask for your Hammer
[2:06:06] give him your saw
[2:06:11] also we got some work to do out here I
[2:06:14] just want to let you know you can out
[2:06:17] give
[2:06:19] God but if if here the here they take
[2:06:23] everything that was given to us to be
[2:06:26] superch Christians and they take it and
[2:06:29] they do it for the wrong reason and are
[2:06:33] wealthy Rich everything a guy asked me
[2:06:37] how do you get rich I said be a
[2:06:42] Christian you can outgive God you can't
[2:06:45] outdo anything for
[2:06:49] God can do it
[2:06:52] I want you to succeed I want to succeed
[2:06:56] how am I going to do it I'm going to
[2:06:58] follow the word of God if you don't feed
[2:07:01] the spirit the word of God it will die
[2:07:05] if you don't do these things thank you
[2:07:08] Lord if you don't see a decision and do
[2:07:11] it we just heard brother Bram said when
[2:07:13] Satan tries to bother you and stop you
[2:07:15] from doing something what do it anyway
[2:07:25] Colossians 2
[2:07:27] and8 I really want this one to beware
[2:07:31] lest any man spoil you through
[2:07:33] philosophies and vain deceits after the
[2:07:37] traditions of men after the rudiments of
[2:07:40] the world and not after Christ be
[2:07:45] analytical we call that what
[2:07:50] discernment disc
[2:07:52] discern
[2:07:54] everything of what Spirit it is discern
[2:07:57] the motive discern the objective I I I
[2:08:01] want you to discern me I want you to
[2:08:04] discern my motive I want you to discern
[2:08:06] my objective I want you to discern my
[2:08:09] life I want you to look at and say
[2:08:11] where's my heart at because if it's not
[2:08:15] right then you can come to
[2:08:18] me and restore me back to the
[2:08:25] Faith we're not afraid to have people
[2:08:28] look at our lives especially if we're
[2:08:31] trying to reach the same
[2:08:36] goal then let's just read Hebrews 11
[2:08:42] and3 through faith we understand that
[2:08:45] the worlds were framed by the word of
[2:08:48] God so that things which are
[2:08:52] seemed were not made by things which do
[2:08:56] appear not everything is oh church this
[2:09:00] one's a big one to
[2:09:03] me because that's one of the failures I
[2:09:06] think most in the Church of the Living
[2:09:09] God is
[2:09:11] discernment where is this taking
[2:09:15] me and then Hebrews 5 and14
[2:09:27] be strong but strong meat belongeth to
[2:09:30] them that are full of age even those by
[2:09:34] the reason of you of having their senses
[2:09:39] exercised to
[2:09:41] discern both good and
[2:09:46] evil do you all understand that they
[2:09:50] stole that
[2:09:54] so if they stole success for their
[2:09:58] Kingdom why don't we go back to what was
[2:10:01] ours all the time and use the same
[2:10:04] methods to achieve our
[2:10:07] kingdom where's your
[2:10:12] thirst if your control tower is
[2:10:14] thirsting after that bank
[2:10:18] job or that Prestige or or that
[2:10:24] wealth but yet really you're called for
[2:10:28] this Kingdom you're caught in the middle
[2:10:31] how many knows what the definition of
[2:10:33] ladyo
[2:10:35] is
[2:10:37] lukewarm caught in the
[2:10:42] middle there are two things you got to
[2:10:45] do the same things to be good at your
[2:10:48] job good at what you do you got to do
[2:10:51] the same things to be a good
[2:10:54] Christian you say brother McGary this
[2:10:56] sermon sure ain't very deep it's deeper
[2:10:59] than you
[2:11:03] imagine because it's
[2:11:07] real it's real scripture it's real word
[2:11:11] and it's what the prophet taught and
[2:11:16] practiced and I'm going to say the best
[2:11:18] thing I can say you can do it it's in
[2:11:22] you to do you've just got to shake
[2:11:26] yourself and go
[2:11:31] back do a
[2:11:33] self-examination and reset your path
[2:11:37] going
[2:11:38] forward
[2:11:41] practicing
[2:11:43] successful
[2:11:45] Christian
[2:11:48] practices surround yourself with good
[2:11:50] people
[2:11:59] Proverbs 13 and
[2:12:03] 20 he that walketh with wise men shall
[2:12:07] be wise but the companion of fools shall
[2:12:11] be
[2:12:13] destroyed do you understand I we could

[2:16:06] people people of
[2:16:09] like Precious
[2:16:15] faith and if you're listening to someone
[2:16:18] on the internet that don't teach it the
[2:16:21] way you believe it don't quit keep
[2:16:25] drinking the
[2:16:36] poison if I stood up here some Sunday
[2:16:39] let's say I had a big name and a great
[2:16:41] reputation and I was kind of preacher
[2:16:44] that people really enjoyed and I started
[2:16:47] getting up preaching the Trinity I hope
[2:16:49] you'd vacate
[2:16:56] I hate you that you wouldn't sit there
[2:16:59] listening to
[2:17:01] something that you know is not what the
[2:17:04] prophet of God taught because you've got
[2:17:07] friends and you've got
[2:17:11] reputation
[2:17:13] and it it doesn't lead to
[2:17:16] success
[2:17:19] spiritually the trou with leaven is a
[2:17:23] little
[2:17:24] leaven leth the whole
[2:17:27] lump that was one of the things they
[2:17:29] said get stuff out that that don't
[2:17:36] fit and don't tell yourself oh I I I
[2:17:40] just changed tires if you change tires
[2:17:43] you can be a
[2:17:45] successful
[2:17:47] spiritual Giant
[2:17:51] a burning light a powerful candle maybe
[2:17:55] not in their
[2:17:58] world but you
[2:18:00] look oh I won't go
[2:18:02] there that I that would get so
[2:18:05] big Proverbs
[2:18:12] 18:24 a
[2:18:15] man that hath
[2:18:17] friends must show himself friendly and
[2:18:21] if there is a friend that sticketh
[2:18:25] closer than the
[2:18:27] brother stay with the people that loved
[2:18:30] you walk with you through everything
[2:18:33] you've ever been
[2:18:34] for have loved you with an
[2:18:38] undying
[2:18:40] love and has given their
[2:18:43] life walked in every decision you
[2:18:47] made
[2:18:48] right always been there
[2:18:53] those are the
[2:18:55] people the knives of a friend are
[2:18:59] sweeter than the kisses of an enemy we
[2:19:03] don't social climb we don't
[2:19:07] hide we got one
[2:19:10] goal and that's
[2:19:14] eternity if I tell you the truth it's
[2:19:16] not the truth to hurt that's right the
[2:19:19] truth's what set you free
[2:19:21] it allows you to make decisions I'm not
[2:19:23] against any decision you
[2:19:28] make but keep God in everything you
[2:19:32] choose to do you choose to go off to
[2:19:35] school go off to school and be
[2:19:37] successful keep God
[2:19:40] there you don't have to hide what you're
[2:19:44] doing the scripture says that he knows
[2:19:47] what you're
[2:19:48] doing in your tent
[2:19:53] well there's nothing hid from
[2:19:55] him let's go
[2:20:01] together a friend sticks with
[2:20:05] you not against you he's for
[2:20:11] you I've said hard things to hard people
[2:20:14] but it's made them
[2:20:18] better that's right I'm not here to
[2:20:22] judge I'm here to
[2:20:25] help I got to look at my own self I got
[2:20:28] to cast out the beam I've got plenty of
[2:20:31] failure but I'm going to deal with them
[2:20:34] and overcome amen by what by the washing
[2:20:38] of the water of the
[2:20:41] word how do you overcome by the washing
[2:20:45] of the water of the word you must feed
[2:20:49] the holy Spirit the
[2:20:55] word and
[2:20:56] then second Corinthians 6
[2:21:02] and14 be ye not unequally Yol together
[2:21:06] with
[2:21:07] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[2:21:12] righteousness with
[2:21:13] unrighteousness and what communication
[2:21:16] hath light with Darkness
[2:21:21] how many have ever heard them preach be
[2:21:23] around successful people if you want to
[2:21:26] make your game better play
[2:21:28] what better
[2:21:34] people you know I like playing checkers
[2:21:36] with six years
[2:21:39] olds man I play checkers with guys that
[2:21:42] have me so cornered so quick how did you
[2:21:46] do that
[2:21:50] but the only way you'll get
[2:21:53] better and we're not talking better in
[2:21:56] the world we're talking spiritual the
[2:21:58] only way you're going to get more
[2:22:00] spiritual but if you hang around with
[2:22:03] people that keep giving you an
[2:22:07] excuse and help you do things that are
[2:22:11] contrary to your
[2:22:15] conscience all things are lawful but all
[2:22:19] things aren't expedient
[2:22:22] if everybody wants to go down and and go
[2:22:25] to a ball game and it's not in your
[2:22:28] heart then you don't do it don't hang
[2:22:32] around with people that are keeping keep
[2:22:34] you always pulling down your your
[2:22:37] standards and dragging down your
[2:22:39] principles and and making it a way for
[2:22:42] you you know that's just like the guy
[2:22:44] says oh just one
[2:22:48] drink just just one
[2:22:54] dance don't be an
[2:22:59] enabler that's why I told told Lord I'm
[2:23:02] not going to be a bank this
[2:23:07] year and not there's if if someone's
[2:23:10] continually in a
[2:23:13] problem what's the root of their
[2:23:17] problem it's not bailout right
[2:23:22] you know what I mean there there's
[2:23:24] there's there's there there there's
[2:23:27] successful things that aren't being
[2:23:30] practiced and I've been telling you
[2:23:33] these these are all the things these are
[2:23:35] the things the
[2:23:36] world is telling their
[2:23:39] people and yet there's a
[2:23:42] scripture for every one of them I hope
[2:23:46] your minds are going a mile a minute
[2:23:49] looking at your lives and judging your
[2:23:52] actions and judging your
[2:23:54] thinking because a tree that is
[2:23:57] unfruitful is hewed down and throw in
[2:24:01] the
[2:24:04] fire and Paul said I would that you be
[2:24:08] fruitful that you grow in the knowledge
[2:24:10] and the wisdom of the kingdom of
[2:24:15] God these things are practices believe
[2:24:19] it or not that are word
[2:24:24] practices and Satan robbed
[2:24:27] them and made his kingdom
[2:24:30] successful and accused us if we do them
[2:24:35] we're
[2:24:40] Sinners can you believe
[2:24:42] that you know what that is that's Garden
[2:24:46] of Eden
[2:24:48] deception that's decep Ion on the
[2:24:52] scale of the Garden of
[2:24:57] Eden thinking people that they can have
[2:24:59] an
[2:25:00] experience a one-time experience without
[2:25:03] putting any work having any life style
[2:25:07] having any pattern Paul told Timothy lay
[2:25:10] for thyself a pattern of good
[2:25:14] works every single one of these says
[2:25:17] have practices you want to work out you
[2:25:20] don't go to the gym once a
[2:25:23] month or once a year like
[2:25:27] me if you're going to do something about
[2:25:29] it you got to have the
[2:25:32] self-discipline you got to put in the
[2:25:35] work you can't imagine the
[2:25:42] result I can't go to the store and buy a
[2:25:45] pair of
[2:25:47] 46s and pretend that I'm thinner
[2:25:54] now I got you wondering don't

[2:26:02] seeds throw out the
[2:26:05] stuff that it doesn't have anything to
[2:26:08] do with your goal I read that on the

[2:26:16] need to
[2:26:19] have don't bother
[2:26:22] yourself with

[2:27:06] things amen are things that we have
[2:27:11] thought we could cover up with the
[2:27:13] message of the hour we can say I believe

[2:27:18] prophet I don't have to be a Christian

[2:27:38] Catholic I can almost sin any
[2:27:43] sin and I might have to do a little time

[2:31:38] Sunday
[2:31:39] morning and getting a little tidbit of a
[2:31:43] grain that this poor preacher can whoop
[2:31:48] up and that your
[2:31:52] food you'll starve to death right no
[2:31:56] matter how in my mind I want to think
[2:31:58] I've got a great ministry I Don't Preach
[2:32:00] like a lot of people preach not my
[2:32:05] calling but you've got to have more than
[2:32:09] one food
[2:32:13] source you can't throw all
[2:32:15] your self under one Ministry and one
[2:32:22] voice and I'm not talking about going on
[2:32:25] the internet and searching for voices
[2:32:27] I'm talking about what the scripture
[2:32:29] says that's just one of them uh 1
[2:32:34] Corinthians
[2:32:40] 14:26 how is it
[2:32:43] then
[2:32:45] Brethren when you come together every
[2:32:48] one of you have a song
[2:32:50] half a Doctrine half a tongue half a
[2:32:54] revelation half an interpretation let
[2:32:58] all things be done unto
[2:33:01] edification
[2:33:03] amen all these are
[2:33:06] sources not just in the
[2:33:09] church not when you just come together
[2:33:13] here when you come together at home when
[2:33:16] you come together at work I love it when
[2:33:18] we work out here with the brothers and
[2:33:20] they're talking about God and they're
[2:33:22] talking about this and they I love these
[2:33:24] brothers that go to these chats and they
[2:33:27] put quotes down and they're edifying one
[2:33:30] another and they're feeding one another
[2:33:33] have multiple sources of
[2:33:36] Fellowship in your heart uh Colossians 3
[2:33:45] and16 let the word of Christ dwell in
[2:33:51] you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[2:33:55] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[2:34:00] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[2:34:03] Grace in your heart to the lord it's an
[2:34:08] atmosphere multiple
[2:34:11] sources of Christian atmosphere and
[2:34:15] finally the last two are be frugal
[2:34:20] and I'll just read the scriptures John
[2:34:23] 16:12 Proverbs
[2:34:26] 13:22 and the last great thing that they
[2:34:31] have is
[2:34:33] share
[2:34:35] Ephesians 428 Matthew 8 and10 it's
[2:34:39] freely given freely
[2:34:43] give so here's
[2:34:47] Satan the only way he could be
[2:34:49] successful and have a kingdom is pervert
[2:34:53] God's
[2:34:56] success all the things that God put in
[2:35:01] man to
[2:35:02] do to reach spiritual Heights Satan
[2:35:06] stole
[2:35:08] them and
[2:35:10] made his
[2:35:12] angels in his Satan's
[2:35:15] Eden where he's the God of this evil age
[2:35:20] and took all those people and gave them
[2:35:24] success to worship
[2:35:28] him but I
[2:35:31] say they were
[2:35:33] mine in the
[2:35:35] beginning God put in me the thirst for
[2:35:41] him God put in me the desire to be like
[2:35:46] Paul to be like Peter that's right
[2:35:50] to have my role
[2:35:53] models what I consider Stars what I
[2:35:56] consider great and I trust this
[2:36:00] morning that as long and as
[2:36:04] hard as we
[2:36:06] spoke that going
[2:36:10] forward that you will take a new
[2:36:13] focus in your
[2:36:16] life that the distractions
[2:36:20] you'll move them out of the way and you
[2:36:23] will
[2:36:24] repurpose Your Existence and your
[2:36:28] reason for
[2:36:33] living as you read in thirst the prophet
[2:36:35] of God made a statement he says it's
[2:36:37] only natural for a boy to like a
[2:36:41] girl he says that's a natural thing to
[2:36:45] fall in love let's don't take things
[2:36:48] that are natur natural and try to do
[2:36:51] away with them let's take the things
[2:36:54] that God gave us naturally and govern
[2:36:58] them by the word of God and you'll be
[2:37:05] successful be
[2:37:07] successful God wants you to be
