Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

able to serve you each day Lord and to Know You Lord in a personal relationship is just something you can't put into words Lord Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together as Believers Lord and Lord each one here Lord I just pray a special blessing upon them Lord as they made their way here on a Wednesday night Lord and as most people are just home watching TV or gathering together and drinking or whatever they may be doing but Lord we came to hear from you Lord and Lord we're in expectation of what you would have for us Lord as your minister would come forth Lord we just pray a special blessing upon him for his labor Lord Lord we so love love you and just ask your blessings upon the tithes and offerings Lord and we ask all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I uh Billy kind of put me on the spot but uh so I was I turned in a a testimony to give a testimony during the meetings and when it didn't happen I was just like you know well maybe it was for me but uh brother Billy asked me to to give it and so I'll just share but I'll just tell you I could have a testimony for the past two days three days since the meetings have happened I mean it's just the Lord has just really been dealing with my heart and it's been it's been very special uh uh me and another brother worked together a lot and I kind of told him you know the Lord's really been dealing with me and and uh it it's really something that's really hard to admit to people when you have something like this on you but this has been probably something I've been dealing with for 30 years and uh it's just a negative Spirit you know and a complaining spirit always finding something wrong wrong with what's going on or how your life is going or you know why does everything got to be like this or like that and well I just I just came out and asked the Lord you know hey Lord I I need you to deal with this because this is something I've been dealing with a long time and I'm just tired of it and so the Lord even before the meetings happened he had already dealt with it and then when I came to work Monday of course the Devil he's going to bring everything and so it it started again and I and I was just like you know what I'm not going to get caught up in it and I prayed before I went to work and and this morning I even took a little extra time set it aside and just Lord I just need you to deal with it and help me I said you know you be in total control and so he's really he's really stepped in and helped me to overcome this and and I'm really looking forward to what he has because I feel like it gave me back my joy I felt like I lost my joy and and I I feel like he gave me that back and uh I uh so I did write a little something and I'm not a writer but I did write a little something because it it just really struck my heart and uh it wasn't it was just in the moment and I'll just share it and I wasn't going to do this but but it it kind of goes along with what I've been dealing with and it this involves all of us but it says God has called a special people a group of Believers uh the bride of Christ to overcome at every turn the deception that has been put on the World by Satan himself we know that by the word of God we cannot be deceived for we are the bride of Christ The Living Army of God and shall win and overcome by the word of God which is our food for the hour Satan we hope you are listening for all we will not be defeated you are a defeated Foe and we will rise up in Victory because of the word of God says so and then this scripture that that I I just it I just happened to cross it that morning when I was reading and it just went so well but and so it says there is one B this is uh Ephesians 44 there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and our father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended upon high he led captive captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended in the same also that ascended up far above all Heaven that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the Perfection of the Saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ and that's that's us amen and then this is just to finish off what I was writing so and it says so Satan you know that the word you know the word so for that what it's worth take this the word of God and go crawl in your fiery hole in Ephesians 4 4-6 and that's [Applause] it amen the word of God is our weapon amen when it comes to you use it chop him piece by piece and just cast him out tell him you don't have a place here amen that's that's how we overcome amen I bless your name I bless your name oh and I give you all to give you praise oh when you are the last the truth of way oh and I bless your name oh and I'm oh and I bless your name I bless your name I bless hallelujah oh I give you one to give you praise oh and you are the life the truth the way oh I bless your name oh let's all stand and sing it as we invite brother inas with beding all and Sil great and oh and and in the pain be begin to sing the change word and oh I bless your [Music] name I bless your name oh and I give you all I give you praise oh and you are the L the the [Music] way I bless your name oh oh you're in a turn in your mind reach out and pra defy your and will fall in Jesus I bless your name I bless your name iess your name I give you all I give you you are the the true iess your name I bless SP our hearts gracious Heavenly Father Lord how fitting of a song Lord Jesus for how you've been dealing with me Lord Jesus the prison of the Mind the place where your Prophet spoke and said is the Battleground for the believer where God and Satan meet to fight but Lord thanks be to God that you won the victory Lord Jesus before the foundation of the world the war was settled Lord Jesus Jesus we had the victory because we were in you Lord let us not get distracted Lord by the things the devil may put in our minds Lord Jesus the prison we may feel that we are in Lord our shortcomings are failures Lord Jesus father we're not identified in that Lord Jesus we're identified in your blood Lord Jesus and your Prophet said that when you look through us to the lens of your blood you see see white Lord Jesus what a comfort Lord Jesus to know that all our sins have been wiped and thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness father we ask Lord this night that you Lord open the hearts of the people Lord Jesus set me aside father anoint my lips Lord I've got a little subject Lord Jesus but father you're the one that makes great subjects Lord Jesus father I pray you take this thought and you minister to each person where they're at that it may be a blessing for them like it has been for me Lord Jesus father I would just want to surrender myself Lord I pray you calm my nerves Lord Jesus and you use me the way you see fit Lord Jesus we ask a blessing over this time that we'll spend breaking bread we ask all these things in the precious and mighty name we ask a prayer for our pastor and sister Leslie as they are out Lord we just ask that you be with them Father in travels and bring them back to us safely father we ask all these things in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if thank you musicians if you were to turn your Bibles with me to John chapter 8 we'll start in the first verse we read to the 11th if you're there say Amen the scripture reads Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stood down stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and rode on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and the El the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her wom you know I I I I want us to put ourselves in this situation with the things you've committed it may not be adultery it may be adultery but now you have Satan who's the accuser of the Brethren and he's now bringing it before Jesus and said well your word says that the wages of sin are death well these people have sinned so what sayest thou and Jesus speaks and put your name there he says women where are are thine accusers had no man condemned thee she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated try my best to just there's so much here that uh the Lord had been dealing with me about uh a while ago on a job with brother Tommy went down to Houston working on a house down there and we had a great conversation about the word and and how often times people question themselves they they question where they're at in life they question the things that God has done for them they misidentify Christ in their life because of the mistake that they make they misidentify who they are because of what they see in the mirror and as we got to talking the Lord had been dealing with me about a subject it only takes a moment and we understand the importance of moments Webster would say a moment is a brief period of time another definition being importance in other words gravity serious weight Veil prominence significance you know we know that it says in a moment in a twinkling of and I we shall be changed so there's power in a moment something takes place when a moment happens a prophet would preach in another sense from that time speaking of a a specific moment in time that something took place that changed the course of your life we want to be real uh uh sober in and thinking about moments in the way that the Lord dealt with me a moment stands alone you may not understand the moment you may receive the revelation of it later on but it doesn't diminish the value of that moment and often times the Lord will be doing something for you he'll move on your behalf he'll show you something and you don't catch it then the closest example I could give to you for example is if you're a parent and you've got kids and they're stubborn and they don't listen I was one of them you you say something over and over and over and over again it's the same thing they don't get it then finally someone says the exact same thing not that they added anything or took away anything but they said exactly what you said and for some reason an aha moment takes place like well I caught that wow I've never heard that before but but you have your entire life but sometimes you miss what God is doing it isn't until you look back and say wow this were just small instances in time that led up to this exact moment this specific hour where God was going to do this thing give you the Revelation for this specific thing the devil loves to disturb you when you have a powerful moment with God if we were to list down some moments that you that you have one of them would be when you get the new birth it's a trouble for a lot of people knowing that do I have what it is that I claim that I have this experience of a new birth do I have it right and what the devil will do is rather than just letting you believe or just plat flat out saying you don't have it he's gotten Smart in this hour he'd rather give you something else as a substitute for proof for you that you've got something when in fact the very thing you're anchoring on was never proof given to the church right you say well I've shouted well I have it that's not it well I've spoken in tongues well I have it well that's not it see all the devil can do when God gives you a moment is he'll bombard your mind with who you are according to his kingdom and if you're not careful then you'll be listening to what he says of you and you'll miss the very moment God's trying to do something for you but we want to be real calm in our spirit we want to be STI and not miss anything right sometimes when you're too loud you'll miss the still moment that's happening before you sometimes when you get too busy you miss the leadership of God there's moments that take place in our life every single day if we're not careful we'll get too occupied and we'll miss that God's trying to do something for us rather than get into the moment and say Lord what is it that you would have for me in this hour in this time we'll say well no you know I've got this bill I've got this to handle I've got that the Lord will be trying to in a service tell you if you want the Holy Ghost claim it it's yours and right in that moment something inside of you says oh I want that Holy Ghost I want to just draw so close to it let me grab a hold of it and then right in that same instance because the spirits are twins right the you have the spirit of God that comes and he's pulling you to him and then the Devil comes well now in the same moment see we often think that it starts when you leave the door but he plants a seed when you're sitting down that says when you leave nothing's changed this is just a workup this is just excitement this is nothing that's profound you've been you've been here before you've heard this before it hasn't changed you before so how is it going to change you now you got we have to be really careful at the tactics of the devil right we know in this time that it's our promise to be able to know the two Spirits within the framework of the church discern them both it's it's good to just it's good to know but now you have to understand well how do I go with the right one how do I stay away from the wrong one the spirits are right there going together they're twins so you thinking on that and and looking at a moment and and and and trying to put myself in in the mind frame that I was in because I caught myself missing many moments I caught myself missing a lot of opportunities I I that Devil's good but I caught myself missing a lot of opportunities we we we we had gone out to eat one time uh I think our pastor have preached a powerful moment about being um being really sensitive to the voice of God and me and brother Tommy had gone out to eat somewhere for lunch and I I saw this this blind man and it it wasn't just that he was blind but it was almost as if somebody took a spoon and scooped his eye out and it was melted so there was no reignment of eyes there and you you see that and it started to work on me that's the first thing I saw when I walked into that restaurant was that blind man and we just got done listening to a prophet speak and saying if you've got the word and the Lord moves on your heart act but rather than acting I Justified myself well he doesn't have any eyes how is I could pray for him but that's that's too big of a miracle that's something too great why would God do that with me but failing to remember that it's got nothing to do with you everything to do with him if you say and speak his word he's the one that moves it's not you we're so fixated on wanting it to be us we we could look for an example at Joshua Joshua in the Bible the great man who told the son stop where you are how many of us have stopped the sun he drew his sword Amen brother Matthew he drew his sword out and said are you for us or the enemy what man with courage that's you saw what happened with with the river The Parting of it you you see all the things that took place in Joshua's life yet such a powerful man Drew no power from himself but he was given a promise the scripture said the words that I gave to my servant Moses take those words live on those words meditate day and night on those words see it's not because a prophet goes off the scene that now because I can do signs and wonders that I not have a voice lord it's the same message that that Prophet preached the power is still the same if you want to stop a son if you want to speak to a storm it's not your own strength it's not your own might but it's his word that does it our task is get in the word take the word apply the word he moves on the word he didn't ask you to move on it he just asked you to believe in its Simplicity and thinking on the this moment as I was there at the restaurant and and I see this the blind man and I I I start now doubting the very word I just heard I got excited in church I loved hearing that oh i' I've got the power to speak the word at my word not because I've been made somebody but because the brides been given thus sayeth the Lord I could have said something to him and prayed for him I don't know what God would have done but I psyched myself out before ever doing anything and that Aid at me because how many times do we see a burden that somebody has a struggle a pain something serious and we're so fixated on our troubles what we've got going on that we can't take a second and say you know what I'm going to deny myself and live for the others let me inter in for them you know in fact you entering in for somebody else will cause God to move on your behalf but you can't just be Focus focused on what you got going on that you can't see what God's trying to do in others lives I realized in that moment I said Lord I missed it I missed that moment I don't know what God would have done but we serve a God who proves his word it doesn't change it Remains the Same if he saved then and he healed then if the blind saw then they see now and they will see in the future his word doesn't change we're the ones that change and then we try to change his word to fit what we think oh I don't have a great enough years in the message and preaching this word I couldn't say nothing to that person man I just started leaving last week what good is my word going to do for that person they have a serious need let me go get this 50 plus year veteran to say something I'm sorry who baptized Paul was it Peter we would call it a nobody what did ananas do not not ananas is Safar but what did he do what was his story outside of baptizing Paul where else did you hear his name don't belittle your significance in the kingdom of God somebody who just got saved yesterday has got the same Power by the word as the one that's been in this message for 50 years your task with believing the word and speaking the word not understanding or comprehending how it will come to be just say what he said and he moves on your behalf and it wasn't for the lack of understanding that I had for the lack of examples that I've had of God doing miraculous things I I trust we've all heard the testimony of brother Brandon with the young lady that was blind and he's praying for her and you see these two twinkles little little look like little stars coming down and they stop he goes wait a minute brother Brandon for forgot to ask you what color eyes you wanted and he speaks the word and she gets the ey she asked for we've seen the Miracles we've seen the example of what being in a moment looks like coming off of a plane well I got to be here I got to be there but trusting and I'm going this way I'm going to take a left I'm going to take a right hello Parson how' you know I was a Parson see our Prophet was an example for us of how to live in a moment right denying yourself it was a sacrifice he made being away from his family being away from his loved ones that didn't come with no cost it pained him to be away from his little girl but yet he had to to bring us this message and we think we can live in a present moment with Christ with anything less than a sacrifice let's not miss the moment of what God's trying to do we we we touched on the times that where you have the struggle with the Holy Spirit Well do I have it do I not it was I want to say years of battling in my mind and it's not just the young people that deal with this but even the older ones that fight questioning do I have it do I have it do I have it do I have it you can't start you you can't move forward till you answer that question so the devil's only objective if he can get you to misrepresent the moment you had with God then you'll never come to the revelation of what what he's done for you and once you forsake what he's done for you he's got you don't let the devil rob you of the joy of your salvation your the joy of your salvation comes from you believing he saved you if you didn't believe he saved you you couldn't be joyous there' be no reason to be joyous Jesus Christ is the high priest of your confession what you you speak what you say he moves on so if God gives you a moment in its Simplicity and say if you receive his word you receive him right then grab a hold of it don't wait till you get this person's got to lay hands on me no the word went forth the word spoke take a hold of it grab it then amen the prophet of God says in the sermon faith Works say faith Express paragraph 186 I want to tell you something now work on that pulsation that spur of A Moment Like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene all those just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it hold it that spur of a moment yes it was revealed to him he went to meet those thousand Philistines now what do you think when those Philistines said now look coming there that little shrimp only about 4ot and a half tall to begin with with seven little curls hanging down his back like Mama's Little see come along there with a Jawbone of a mule and look at us what a great Army we are isn't that ridiculous but what was he doing he was expressing to those Philistines what had been revealed to him by God he grabbed the Jawbone and took off because that's what he put in his hand he put that in his hand that's what he believed he could do it and by doing so he was expressing to those Philistines what God had put in his heart to do John the Baptist expressed his faith by his works and when he said there stands one among you now just think of that St John I got the scripture St John 126 see he said they said you say the Messiah is coming why he said man what's the matter with you we've been looking for him for a thousand years he said he's standing right among you now Hallelujah so is he tonight amen see so whatever need you came into this door with right now you've been told he is here tonight will you grab a hold of the moment and say Lord I've got this desire I've got this ask I've got this burden Lord take control right now if you hold to it you don't need nothing else but I believe amen I believe I believe I believe will do more for you than I've done a hundred prayers of hundred sermons I've done a hundred Good Deeds how many people did I pay lunch for okay I paid for a thousand people's lunches this year that's all good but if you don't have the belief in the word what good is the works I want us to I want us to hold this in our minds in in in this in this uh sermon works as Faith Express brother is describing because often times unless you you look deeper into a story you only catch I I I guess I would say what's presented to you but a prophet would come and then Enlighten you a bit more it always fascinates me that a prophet could say I can see Amos standing there with a white beard bald stroking through his beard like how did he see that I don't I don't read that when I read my Bible but when that Prophet is reading it and he's telling you I can see oh I wish I could see what he saw but you know he told me what he saw and he said that I was the sinless bought purchased bride of Jesus Christ there was no fault in me no mistake in Me God Don't Make Mistakes when he called you he gave you everything you needed to be able to fulfill the calling when he elected you it's not because you merited it he made you dust in this story brother bam would say that that Jawbone didn't lose a tooth now how many of you have broken a bone it's really not that hard to break break a bone with the right fall at the right time right angle it's not that hard people break bones all the time but you have to understand what he was fighting against the armor the Philistines had was one inch thick one inch thick this is what they taught us in school for an inch but I got bigger hands so I don't know but we'll call this an inch the armor was one inch thi and he's got this Jawbone and he SL La all those Philistines when a prophet says he grabbed the Jawbone because that's what he put in his hand what's been placed in your hand for a weapon you don't have a Jawbone what have you been given the greatest weapon God could ever give you his word how can you not do the same thing with every Philistine in your own life take the word slay him he didn't have one in armor he bows down to the word of Jesus Christ speak the word you've been given Authority the prophet of God says in the conflict between God and Satan now let me say something of you Christians down here don't you never stop one second for the devil paragraph 83 don't stop to reason it out when you start to reason it the Devil comes right in you cannot reason God you cannot understand God you've got to just believe God see I can't explain God nobody can I can explain many things but the only thing I just believe it because he said so now there's none of us can explain it don't try to explain it so when God gives you a revelation of something it doesn't matter what condition you find yourself in you could be indicted tomorrow for prison it didn't matter you know the circumstance you know what you're going through think of the most drastic one if the word said you're free don't explain how you'll become free amen just take what the word says and let God move what's imposs what to you seems like can't be done to God everything is possible it's always fascinated me the word impossible couldn't be spelled unless you had I am in the beginning of it so I yes impossible really means I am possible so if you've got the I am then all things are possible so what's impossible to you what's hard what's taking so much time you've got the word yes don't miss the moment grab a hold of it when God speaks something to you in your circumstance don't just wash it and say I've heard this before I've heard this before I've heard this before so what act amen imagine if Samuel when he was in there sleeping you call him Samuel Samuel imagine if he would have said you know I've heard this two times now it's been nothing I'm just going to leave it alone what would have happened he had to move he had to ask are you calling me he said I'm not calling you but the next time you hear that call you answer you say Lord here I am that's what we've been tasked it's not how many times you've heard the same thing over and over again well I've heard repentance preached 100 times well I've heard this preached this many times well I've heard this you take it every time it's preached it'll bless you the word is in season never out of season the only thing that's out of season is us we're the ones that think we're too good for a simple message oh I want I I give me the Mysteries give me something great but the ministry of forgiveness is so far forgotten of us do we not remember the sinful life we used to live the death we merited because of our Lives forgiveness is the least thing we want talked about we don't want to hear forgiveness then we got to do it we'd rather hear I'm a blessed people I've got power I've got strength I've got all this stuff but if you don't have love what do you have it's it's it's I I Lord I didn't want to go this way way forgiveness for the believer to me is an anchor am how can you go to God and repent and make things right when people come to you people do wrong to you and you're so set in your ways well if you don't come say sorry to me I'm just not going to accept it God forgave you before you committed the sin when was the sacrifice made before the foundation of the world how dare us to demand somebody to come and apologize to us he's done how many things wrong to me oh that brother just rubed me the wrong way he looks at me he said all these things about me man she just gossips every time I'm around her she says this every time I'm this see the identification of the devil was the accuser of the Brethren don't be caught with the same identification don't accuse the Brethren you're called to lift up the Brethren speak positivity Speak Life your words have power get the negative tongue out of your life speak only positivity people Harbor hurts for years and years and years and can't seem to move on to the level of forgiving to say Lord whether they ask it or not I've been waiting for years for them to apologize they haven't said anything nevertheless I forgive him Lord on my account remove it Lord I don't want them to be condemned for it I've settled it on their behalf when we get that kind of attitude in the church then somebody can walk in who does who may just not look like us we may just not like how they talk or how they present themselves but you've got the same love Christ had and you can forgive them where are your accusers they are none but we we've got accusations accusations I mean we've got list of accusations it's easy to forgive somebody for something that they've done we now need to learn to forgive and forget not to hold what has happened against them move on you heard it this weekend a Believer ought to be unbothered but we get bothered by everything the simplest thing well I think this water belongs here well the left side not a fan of it right side looks better and that will bother us so much to the point it changes our attitude it changes how we're just I'm just to to be mad today I want it here how old are we imagine how we look like it's like when your kids are arguing about a toy and you're like are you serious I could go buy you another one what are you arguing about but they don't want another one they want that toy you give them something else no they want that the moment the other kid wants the new toy now he says no I want that toy and the old toy loses its value what is happening to us what are we doing that we've gotten so low I I I I got to thinking on this with the power of confession when you wake up in the morning remember it's a moment everything is a moment when you wake up give God a moment amen when you go to sleep give him a moment find some time throughout the day give God a moment we wake up in the morning how many of has this happened to just this past week this happened to me we're not too big to admit we are needy people we need more of God in our life every single day I woke up and for some reason it was just going to be a bad day because I said so I had a moment moment and a chance to choose between having a good day and a bad day I spoke a bad day and somehow everything that happened was bad power of the tongue have you not been given the right to create your atmosphere speak what you will have you not been given thus sayeth the Lord and you're going to speak negativity I'm just going to have a bad day today what if you never have another bad day till the Rapture comes that's my heart's desire regardless of the circumstance I don't want no bad day none whatsoever oh but what happens when that devil just throws it on you that day when that person that always irritates you just does a little bit more than usual that day that employee you don't like the boss you don't like the person you're living with you don't like sometimes what happens then do you look on that and say I'm not going to bite I'm not taking that I'm going to apply the token in my home at my job everywhere that I'm at if there's somebody that's going to be happy it's going to be me if there's somebody that's going to be smiling it's going to be me if there's somebody that they won't understand why I'm always happy let it be me the prophet said a Believer should be the most joyous person on the earth where's your joy you're going to make a Rapture there's so much to be happy for don't choose to be sad don't choose to be depressed so oh so what that bill can't be paid I it eats at us and bothers us and it'll change our complete mood we don't want to talk to nobody we just want to be alone as if that's ever solved anything for anybody come to the house of the Lord sit down enter into the service and you watch if my God's Not faithful he said he' to be faithful and if he says something he's not in the business of taking back his word so we shouldn't be either if you speak under enthusiasm or excitement that I'm going to trust in God we hold yourself to that word and trust in him even if it's the last moment the last second hold to the faith hold to your confession never let your actions speak different from your confession don't say I'm this and walk that way no say what you will and walk in that path imagine if Abraham would have said well I believe I'm going to have a child and never got prepared what he would I'm I'm the red light will be right there there'll be two cars in front of you the right lane is open you have no business going to the right lane cuz you're turning left but somehow in your heart you say I can get there and speed up and pass these two slow and get in front of them and I can make that turn before them what are you rushing to where are you going fast nowhere I just today I got cut off driving here to church and the guy that cut me off was so mad he let me hear it with this horn y we met at the light what is it gained what's we'll be in line oh that's a long line man I don't want to wait in that line hey let me go and talk to that person let try to get let me see if I can cut if I can get in front these are small things but they add up to big things these small things are only a reflection of how we are with the kingdom of God the prophet said the nature types the spiritual if you can't wait on Simple Things how can you wait when God gives you a promise he's going to give you your son he's going to give you that spouse he's going to give you these things how can we expect to have the patience and the waiting for the great things if we can't have it for the Small Things Lord help us the prophet of God says in the com between God and Satan don't reason paragraph 87 don't reason don't try to reason it it hasn't got no reasonings you just believe it you don't reason a thing because remember the only way that you can accept God Is by faith not by reasons not by understanding not able not by understanding not able to explain you don't explain nothing you believe something not what you feel Jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it that's right you just believe what God Said I can't explain it to you how could the greatest miracle that I could think of is a man who just like take a pig and tell that pig you know you're no more a pig you're a lamb and he becomes a lamb see that would be hard to believe well it's the same thing takes place when you become converted from a sinner to a Christian see it changes your own opinions it changes your own will it changes everything that's in you and it brings you into another life and gives you another spirit that bears forth another record see then your old life has to die and the new one has to be born again and the blood and then see you're nor more the creature you was at all that's when you become behind the blood fortified with the word don't try to explain nothing just believe it and go on Lord I believe savior raise my faith in thee till it can move a mountain see Lord I believe for all my doubts are buried in the fountain all the devil tries to do is to get you to raisen get you to think you'll be in the midst of a situation in the midst of a moment rather than accepting what God's doing you'll take what the devil's putting in your ear we do this all the time a minister somebody will say it could it didn't have to be a minister you could be at work and the coworker says man are you feeling okay no I'm not well by his stripes you're healed I guess it's oh yeah you know he's not a Believer so I'm not going to take that anyway he like's what's he got to tell me what does he know don't disregard the vessel that gives the message truth stands alone regardless of who gives it if it's truth amen it doesn't matter who says it don't reason don't think just accept be in the moment our Prophet give us an example of what it looks like to be in a moment when he received the vision of the boy being raised in Finland he saw it beforehand when he saw the signs of that Vision now being manifested oh he said now it's just drama Hallelujah I can sit back this is going to meet its expected end because he saw it before now a prophet stands and says he saw you With Victory he saw you with power he saw you overcoming all things and rather than receiving what he told you you're now trying to understand how it'll be how can it come I've been struggling with this I've been fighting with that did a prophet not speak over you is he not the Seer for the age can he not see further than we can so if he spoke those things about you it's high time we took it and grabbed the moment and said Lord you said that about me that's me you you said that nothing could hold me that's me you said that I could overcome all things not some things all things that's me you said the spirit of lust gotten a hold on me that's me you said the spirit of Gossip got a hold of me no not no more that's me see the prophet of God in this sermon we talk he's talking about uh somebody will tell you well you believe in Divine Healing there's no such a thing and he said our response as a Believer should be not for you but for me there is go on they say oh I got the baptism on the H ghost what even is a baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't believe in that not for you but for me there is go on we don't have to stop every time and reason with him and try to justify what we believe you're the believer you're called to believe it take it and walk with it the prophet of God says in a little bit lower in paragraph 94 in the same sermon the conflict between God and Satan now we find out Eve losing the battle she got from behind the word raised up on top of the trench and say you don't say so is that the truth she's lost right there see before that anything that the devil was saying the serpent would say she would say but we were told we were told we were told we shouldn't do this we shouldn't do this we should so the devil got slick and he presented her in a different way and rather than obtaining the same confession she had she responds you don't say so is that the truth see she questioned she's lost right there well you know we don't teach that over at our church we believe in what he said here yeah but listen dear you know better than that your own Common Sense would tell you that's not right why I heard them people just cry and cry what they crying about see now own Common Sense would show you that you're just worked up they're emotional see if you stop to listen to that you've lost the battle Lord help us he says if you're going to what the lord gave the promise and you can believe it it changes the whole program this is the power of a moment when God puts you in a moment in an opportunity I believe anytime you come into contact with the word it's a moment you have two options given to you I'm going to take what's being spoken to me and I'm going to live by it or I'm going to walk out worse than I came in that's not something I said that Prophet said you never come into His presence remaining the same you either leave Better or Worse we want to be on the side that leaves better so when God gives us a promise of something it's our task take it believe it it'll change the entire program I won't be much longer Satan has another tactic that he loves to do like he did with Jesus he'll bring to you scriptures to try to justify why that moment isn't for you well your heart condemns you so you can't pray yeah you this that's just not going to work for you man you yeah your conscience is against you that's not going to work well one John 20 tells me that if my heart condemns me that God is greater than my heart well if he's greater than my heart my heart no longer condemns me so whatever I have need of I can now ask I can boldly come before him and make my ask in Revelation 12 we see that the devil is the accuser of the brethen Brethren his sole desire is to call you by your sin in hopes you accept it then he can rob you of the joy of your salvation that's his sole tactic if God wants to bless you with something remember that thing you did yesterday you can't have that blessing you fell short of Grace yesterday it's not going to work yeah I'm sorry and we just in that moment we're about to grab it about to grab it he says that and we just H you know what you're right I I I can't get a hold of that that's that's That's too great for me I i' I've I've sinned too much my past is too bad I I can't grab a hold of that word it's it's it's a little bit higher than I can handle at the moment that's not what my Bible says my Bible says he called you elected predestinated you died for you before you ever committed a sin before you ever fell all the things you've done he knew you do yet he still thought you were worth dying for if that kind of a God can think that about you how much more you when you find yourself in that place where he gives you a promise and the Devil comes up you cast him down you say those things may be true in the flesh but we walk not after the flesh but we walk after the spirit you don't have to accept the other moment that God wants that Satan tries to give you take the moment God's wanting to give you accept his moments walk in his as we said before there's it's twins it's so close if you're not careful you'll miss it the story of the W of the woman that got delivered from dancing that got delivered from clubbing and here she's been given a moment she's walking by say well let me just pop my head in just for a moment just for a second just to see you know what she maybe she thought I'm going to testify to them I'm going to tell them what God's done for me don't be foolish don't go into the Devil's Playground thinking you won't come back with bruises I don't care how Holy Ghost filled you are you'll come back with bruises if you're not careful be very sober in everything that you do but in that story it fascinates me you've got two options there then he gives another story that's a parallel a brother that got saved from cigarettes and he buys him cigarettes and gives him the cigarettes and he doesn't smoke it but this in this story she receives deliverance from those things but she walks right back into the thing that got her there in the first place and she completely lost herself what about us when God wants to grant us a moment let's not miss it it'll take you further than you want to go going on that other side excuse me it'll take you further than you want to go if you take the other option but rather let's take the moment that lines up with the word let's accept a moment that is a echo of what it is we claim we believe I I I think I think it's good practice for the believer when the devil reminds you of your past of your mistakes of your failures and shortcomings right in that moment rather than wallowing and accepting it remind him of his future don't let him be the only one that gives reminders you ought to be following behind him everywhere he goes reminding him you may get me now but I got you there's something waiting you there's something waiting you for me oh there's a home in glory there's a mansion for me but for you you have an expected end it's been laid out in the Bible an everlasting fire you'll be burned in you with all those of your kingdom remind him for a change who he is that'll put him in his place it'll get you out of that circumstance where you're thinking negatively of yourself put him in his place and you're in the right place the problem is you put him at the same level as you he's not he wanted to be at the same level as you God said no God thought you were worth being at the same level as he is oh Lucifer how thou exalted itself you want to be amongst the stars but he was cast down but you where I am you may be also I go and prepare a place for you there's a mansion my father holds a house on a thousand Hills you've got all these promises in the city where the lamb is the light you'll sit and reign with him you are him don't allow him to have power in reminding you're the one that's called to remind him who you are know ye not that I am the Son of God do you not know that I'm a daughter of God mothers remind him on your knees the prophet of God says when a mother gets down to pray it's greater than any prayer of a minister of a pastor you've been given a certain power to get down and intercede utilize it remind him of the authority you've been given he has to back down when the words presented to him don't allow him to rob you of your moment don't miss the moment God could have given you his Spirit years ago and you misrepresented what he done for you and accepted what this devil said and you lose the thing he gave you don't never let him Rob that for you brother brandom says in this sermon coming to a close here the Seal of the Antichrist paragraph 27 I I want you to put yourself in the equation whether it's the holy ghost that you're struggling with or it's a promise God has given you place yourself in the story The Prophet said if you find yourself somewhere find a story that is your circumstance in the book and call upon the same God that moved in the story you read Because this is a living Bible it's not a dead Bible it's not just a book but there's life in it you can only draw life from it if you open it you can't draw life from it closed you have to open it and read eat then you become so whatever promise whatever it is your personal situation is tonight you know it I don't he knows you take this example that the prophet's going to deal with the young man about and you claim it for yourself he says a young man came to my house not long ago sat on a porch I felt sorry for him an old beat up Chevrolet truck and he said brother brandom I want to talk to you and I said all right what is it he said I come from Indianapolis he said and my wife went down to the church to the Pentecostal people and she got the spirit now I'll just say it the way he said it she got the spirit said we did go once in a while in a Presbyterian church and he said she got the spirit she was very happy she come home and told me all about it and wanted me to go down and get it and I said now look honey you go wherever you want to I'll work and make the living but I'm not the religious type he said you go anywhere you want to that'll be all right she said well you ought to come down and get happy with us said we have the greatest time and said she really was a changed person and said brother brandom said that went on for about two years we quit playing cards I didn't go out to the parties with her like I used to said everything stopped said I just come home she'd go to church and I'd sit around and read lead read a library book or go down to the lodge or something and said one day I'd made a cell in the car lot and I come in I put my cat on said it was summertime said I put my cat on to go out cuz some ladies out there said on the road back said I hung up my coat and when I did I said I wonder if I gave them the keys and I reached down in my pocket and I pulled out a little piece of paper and it had wrote on it where will you spend ET eternity said I just laid it down turned the fans on and said I picked it up again I couldn't get away from it where will you spend eternity oh when we first met this message when you first heard this message and you for some reason you just couldn't shake it you you it was the perfect moment for you to receive it because a lot of us was born in this message and from birth we heard and heard and heard and heard but one day day something happened was this ain't this is no longer Mom and Dad's message but this is mine there's something in here for me he said and said I'm 40 years old I got to settle that thing that's right I just had to turn that work over to someone else and went home to seek God said I went to a famous Minister well it's Mr Graham is who it was Billy Graham and said I went to this meeting and he said all that wants to receive Christ stand up well said that I did and he said except Christ now as your personal Savior and it'll be settled said I talked to some of the men there who told me that's what I had to do well said I did the best that I could but said brother Brandon it wasn't settled said I met up with some Nazarene people and said they taken me back in a room and told me unless I got happy enough to shout that I wasn't Sanctified yet and said I stayed in there and all all of us prayed together till it sounded like one person praying said I did get happy and shouted and said they told me it's all over now and said I thought it was then I went out and still it wasn't all over notice how he's describing it in the atmosphere then he went out I was in church these blessings were given to me all these things were told about me I accepted all of them but then I went out I want us to grab a hold of that said I sold all my car said I wasn't worth nearly a half a million dollars I sold my car a lot all of my cars said the only thing is God is just old beat up car trying to give it to preachers and so forth where I can find peace to my soul he said I want to find the Lord and he said then finally I finally run into the Pentecostal people they told me if i' asked them if I've ever spoken in tongues and told them no they said well you haven't got until you speak with tongues said they taken me back and prayed pretty half pretty near half the night in a little tent out behind the big tent and said then I spoke in tongues and they said now you've got it but said brother brandom I didn't have it and said then I went down the street Porter to Dallas to the voice of healing said they had all their boys up there and said they tried to do me good and they couldn't and said they told me you was a prophet to come see you and you tell me surely that I had crossed the separating line and there was no hope for me if I had done all this and still didn't have it and I said well brother I want to tell you something I said I'm not a prophet that's what people say but I said that I said I'm just his servant but now you don't need a prophet to straighten you out did we read the same thing you don't need a prophet to straighten you out you just need the word of God and I said what Mr Graham told you is the truth and what the Nazarene people told you is the truth and what the Pentecostal told you is the truth and yet it's not the truth and what the Pentecost is the truth and yet it's not the truth to shout to raise up your hands to speak with tongues is not receiving Christ receiving Christ is receiving the person of the Lord Jesus Christ then these other things take place after that now you could do all those things still didn't have Christ yet he said well brother brandom where can I find him I said I want to ask you something let's go back to your story and he walked up and said well what do you mean I said you said that that day when you come in pick the up that piece of paper something struck you and you said oh I want to seek God I said from up to that time you were going this way down the road and then you turned this way what did it I said what changed your opinion what come into your heart that made you one time not care for God and something come in to make you go to loving God what done it oh I love how our Prophet explains these things what done it he said well I don't know I said before the could be a creation there has to be a Creator to create the creation God came into your heart right there when you looked at that piece of paper he said you mean I've had it all along do you know what that'll do to somebody that's been looking for the Holy Ghost for years and years and years and years and then you hear a prophet say you've had it all along oh the joy you would have in that moment I tell you that's a reason to shout that's a reason to get excited because the word is it's a nature change I used to desire these things and want to walk these ways but all of a sudden for some reason I want to go this way you know I may stumble and fall I may make mistakes but I'm pressing towards this side of things I'm moving in this direction and anytime I don't like that rout I want to go here what's drawing you to that side this isn't happen chance this isn't an accident it's not your self-will your self-will would only get you to the border and it'll get too hot for you and you'll go back to where you're comfortable but when something pul the prophet tells him you never looked for God before this time that's right you didn't desire the things of God all of a sudden you now desire the things of God well let a prophet finish it he said before there could be a creation there has to be a Creator to create the creation God came into your heart right there when you looked at that piece of paper he said you mean I've had it all along I said certainly brother and he jumped out there and began to scream and cry that will settled what is it he said do you want to pray for me oh you just you were just told you have him do you want to pray for me brother brandom says what's the use of praying for you you don't need any prayer the truth has made you free how often is the word spoken over the pulpit on your specific situation rather than grabbing a hold of that moment saying this is mine you say I just need this person to pray for me and then I'll get it we're not significantly impressed by the word anymore we read here earlier up he said you don't need a prophet to straighten you out what you need is the word of God if the word says you got it you have no need of anything else that's the Breakthrough knowing that the word belongs to you what he said is yours it's not that person that this no it's a personal revelation it's to you but you have to grab it you got to get a hold of it what's the use of praying for you you don't need any prayer the truth has made you free see oh Hallelujah if the musicians would come it it it just moved on my heart heavy to want to understand why I always miss moments why I can never seem to catch what God's trying to do for me in the instance in which he's doing it and I came to the conclusion it's because I'm not impressed by the word I'd rather something else than that word then I found a problem in my members that problem was if the word no longer had the final say what did Faith's final resting place is on the word of God everything comes back to the word everything dovetails to the word salvation word healing word Deliverance word everything comes back to the word so if I've got the word I have no need of anything else I can be at peace knowing you've given me the greatest weapon ever known to man and at time bomb a hydrogen bomb has got nothing on that word of God you could drop an atomic bomb in this building if God said we would all be untouched don't phase by what science says that bomb does it's the separation of atams and then it creates an explosion and it disintegrates you in its instance you can't be disintegrated you're an eternal being the prophet of God said if I die don't say I died I

me oh and no matter where I go he knows my he knows my every thought he sees his fall oh and me hallelujah hallelujah did you enjoy that now that's what I call Deep that's deep that's the word right there you know I thought from but Tim praying just opening prayer and just making has realized this is the moment you know people take they build upon excitement they call it a moment they buildt upon shouting upon screaming and they went and the meeting was so exciting energetic and they they and that foundation will never last don't build upon what's happening out there build upon What's Happening Here what did the word say to you what is it that touched your heart I I love that he said he looked at that piece of paper he couldn't get away from it am but he missed the moment to realize that that's when it happened oh God we we we come to church you know sometimes and I love it because people come in and say well it's another Wednesday it's another Sunday it's another Wednesday no these are moments these are time where you never know the water will may be moving in the spirit will strike and you receive what you've been praying for it's moment we have to to have an attitude and an open heart to say God I'm hearing the word just strike my heart and let let I I I may not hear everything that said but I just want something to strike my heart and not begin to be it become something that starts right there that can build up to whatever God wants to do we don't want to miss moments we don't want to get into the habit and just you know you see everything that's going wrong oh that song we didn't sing it right we didn't do this by doing that you are missing at the moment uh that really spoke to my heart that really stuck my heart I said God I don't ever want to get caught in anything except your word and once you speak it as simple as it is I'm taking it no matter what because once I take it I'm giving you something that you can come and magnify amen let's not miss it let's be careful let's be reverent let's be let's pour everything in let's come with the right kind of mindset let's let's be the they have the right attitude the right everything so that when the word is spoken it's landing on the ground that's been prepared because you never know when that moment is when the word is speaking because remember the scripture says an entrance will be ministered unto you it's an entrance that God has given us that we can get into the kingdom that we can have access into that Kingdom but if we miss it because we are distracted because how many how many messages am I receiving and oh I hear a baby cry over here and I saw that one move enter into the moment and let God make that moment a reality that's the desires of my heart tonight I so enjoyed it I I just I just feel like this is the time of meaning I could just shout and scream Hallelujah because I felt like that's the kind of moment I'm looking for God don't let me miss it don't let me go from now on missing it because I'm distracted I'm thinking about what's going to happen after service about that about no let me just focus and concentrate and know that it's in a still Small Voice sometimes it's even unheard not spoken just read and something struck [Music] you in your car in your shower on your bed any place in church just be attentive to that moment so God can speak to your heart Amen brother Jonathan if is just coming pray for our dismissal tonight and I trust we will just carry out and go out and say God I heard your word and and I'm just praying that you
