Sunday Morning Service
Br. David McGeary
September 4, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] come on [Music] today [Music] foreign [Music] fears [Applause] [Music] I say [Music] gracious and kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again for allowing us to come together Lord be able to recognize the memorial of this occasion the resurrection of our blessed savior this morning Lord we want to yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit enter into fellowship with you Lord lay aside the things of the world Lord have communion this friend with friend Lord we ask you quick in your word to our hearts Lord it's by that word that we have life Lord It's recorded in your word [Music] speaking of Christ though he were a son yet he learned obedience to the things which he suffered being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto those that obey him so lord it's out of that obedience that we congregate here this morning searching for the keys to that eternal life and this only through you Lord it's recognition of that and yielding and obedience to your word Lord and we're able to overcome so this morning Lord may you just Infuse it to us this morning Lord may we be able to lift up the higher Heights deeper depths Lord than we've ever been before Lord we just give you the honor and the glory and the praise that you so richly deserve Lord Lord there's no way that we could come into this awesome presence and not feel the effects of it Lord but we want to claim the benefits of it so if they're sick or needy Lord may we go out of here a different person Lord with our needs resolved with our bodies healed Lord there's nothing too small or too great for you so we want you to come Lord as you come where you feel welcome we we just lay aside these things Lord and would be said give you the preeminence we ask this loving and kindly Lord in the name it's above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen good morning I'm gonna go ahead and turn to Psalm 119 again this morning we can just stay seated for a minute we'll stand give you guys a second to take a load off you know as I was reading Psalm 119 this morning we're going to go ahead and start in verse 145 here in a minute you know there was a statement that sort of caught my attention and it says this it says I cried with my whole heart Hear Me O Lord I will keep thy statutes and I thought about that statement I cried with my whole heart and you know two things sort of caught my attention there notice that you know there was a crying out not with lips not with mouth not with his voice but with his heart a cry of the heart not of the mouth the second thing that caught my attention is it was a cry not just of the heart of the whole heart you know the scriptures speak a lot about crying out to the Lord you know we tend to think of that in terms of crying out with our mouth or with our voice that the louder and the longer we cry out that you know somehow the Lord will hear us as if he has a hearing problem you know and that he won't give us our desire until we've met a certain length of time or a certain volume but you know our mouth can cry for one thing and our heart can cry for something else you know it says in Matthew 15 8 Jesus said this he said this people draweth nigh unto me with her mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me You Know It also says in first Samuel it says for the Lord seeth not as man seeth the Lord looketh on the heart you know God isn't looking for a loud voice or lots of words when we cry out to him you know our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our words is what we've been taught God is looking for a cry with our whole heart there's a certain sound a certain cry that you make when it's your whole heart and only then does he hear heart you know Psalm 119 refers many times to doing things with the whole heart you know it says in verse 2 and 10 it speaks of seeking him with our whole heart with my whole heart have I sought thee Jeremiah 29 13 says this and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart only when we seek him with the whole heart do we find him It also says in verse 34 and verse 69 you know he refers to observing and keeping the word with the whole heart you know Mark 11 23 says for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou casted to the Sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he asks wholehearted completely sold out no room for any doubt only believe in verse 58 he speaks of entreating his favor with my whole heart and then finally here at 145 I cried with my whole heart you know Psalm 9 Psalm 139 I'll begin with the verse the statement I will praise thee with the whole heart you know God doesn't do anything half-heartedly and he [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh I would like with life [Music]

different expectations different needs and desires and father having need of things that we don't even realize that's why this morning we place ourselves in this service into your hands because you know all things you know what we have need of even before that we ask and you told us to cast our cares upon you because you careth for us Lord so we've come to this morning to hear of you to be reminded of the word of God in our lives and of all the great promises that you've given us we ask that you bless each heart and bless each one this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles let's turn over to Matthew the 16th chapter and the first few verses there it's nice to have our new brides with us sister Jenna Shelley's here and sister Rachel I I don't know how to say your last name but we're happy that's just a Rachel formerly to Mom was with us Jenna's with us so I think that's wonderful this morning makes it a real good day for the bride amen praise the Lord amen we're going to read this scripture then we'll have our seats and we'll read several more scriptures and then we're going to play a few moments of a tape this morning I I always enjoy doing that because we know Heaven and Earth will pass away but God's word will not pass away amen so Mark the 16th chapter and uh starting um with the first a verse there of mark and um so we want to follow this theme through and and I want to ask each of us this morning to place ourselves Place ourselves in the scripture and so don't stand away from the scripture and look at it far but you've got to see the Lord Jesus in every scripture and you've got to see yourself in every scripture so you've got to believe that God had the ability to write this book to place the sentences to speak to the prophets in sun-dried times and in diverse manners to be able to write something that would last for all the ages you know so the gospel hasn't changed men's have been reading this book for two thousand years and it's still they still are inspired by it because the author of its Eternal so this word's Eternal so it applies to us today as fresh Manna so when we hear this it's almost like Jesus was looking at them the those people that were standing there but really he was speaking to you he was speaking to everybody that was a part of him so if I could say it like this and just add a little bit to it it was almost like he was speaking to himself because you're part of him amen do you believe that Hallelujah so let's read the Pharisees also with the Sadducees see that these two people didn't even like each other but they hated Jesus so much they United amen the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting and Desiring him tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for this guy is red and lowering oh ye hypocrites can ye discern the face of the Skies but can you not discern the signs of the times amen but can ye not discern the signs of the times amen this word father bless your word just this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated I'd like to turn to a couple more scriptures that are very uh familiar to us and you notice that Jesus is talking about being able to discern the signs of the time and this morning we just want to talk about if we could be important of and the necessity for us to be able to look around and see what's transpiring and and so we just want to go through this a few scriptures this morning that are very very familiar to us and and so if we would uh just turn a few chapters over to the gospel of Saint Luke and and we know these scriptures very well that Luke 17 uh Luke 17 and 22. now Jesus once again is going to be speaking about uh giving us a warning and telling us about the signs or what what to look for that's that's what a sign does it says Exit 5 21 a mile and a quarter right so if you're looking for that look for this a mile down the road just a little farther down the road look for this or or they'll let you know it's a sign it's something that tells you what's fixing to happen or something that you should be aware of we're familiar with warning sides on the road stop signs all different forms of of signs and signs are a way of communicating you want to communicate something to somebody you've got you there's there's signs to do that and signs have symbols and these symbols uh uh show forth that there's uh uh something that you need to be aware of uh the the snake on the squiggly snake looking thing that you know that there's some curvy roads when that thing comes in it comes like up and goes like that you know that this Lane's going to disappear and so you you take heed to those signs because they're telling you that you need to make adjustments okay you've got you've got to be making adjustments you've got to be uh you can no longer continue the way that you're continuing because something is fixing to change out in front of you and and so the the uh gospel has always been uh uh a gospel through all the time God had always given his church signs he's always done that the prophets themselves were assigned to the people uh judgments were assigned to the people so God through time has had very many different ways of trying to get the people to realize that we have to change our course and and so even Jesus spoke and we're all very familiar with the last few chapters of Matthew where he talks about wars and rumors of wars and all these things that should take come the Senate Perdition should rise up uh you know and then he would say the ends not yet these things have to happen now we're living in the day of the Fulfillment of the signs in fact the bride has received the last sign that she's going to get it so we we so it would behoove us if I could say it this way to understand if God gave us the great sign of the pillar of Fire he gave us the great sign and we'll read this scripture of the ministry of the son of man it there he was trying to relay something to us trying to get something to us that that that we could grasp a hold of and realize that it's foretelling us of something that's fixing to take place that we don't want to miss so let's just look again and let's read here in the gospel of Saint Luke and we'll start uh and we'll start with the 20th um verse of the Gospel of Saint Luke and the 17th chapter and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you oh I'd like just a preach right there for a long time let me say it this way he's saying it like this the kingdom of God's not going to come with observation it's not going to be something that you see but the kingdom of God is within you so it's something that is in you that can be contacted so if you have a receiver in you if if we could uh say it that way you have a part of your spirit and a part of your nature that can hear from God that you'll be able to to see you'll be able to hear my sheep hear my voice another they won't follow so the kingdom of God is only he only came to his own amen so he goes on to say he said the kingdom of God is within you and he said unto the disciples the day will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lighteth out of one part of Heaven shineth into the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day for first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given into marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and then straight it destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now do you understand he's telling us things that are going to transfer transpire he's telling us how to see what to see what to recognize what to look for so he's giving us if I can say this a sign he's telling us what the signs will be well if it isn't no good to recognize the sign unless you understand the signs given for an adjustment right so he says he said uh he did and in that day he shall be he he shall be shall be on the Housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife okay let's just think let's just not like we're reading some scriptures and stuff this is exactly the word of God telling you the kind of preparation and attitude that you need to have it another don't get attached to no stuff don't get attached to no job like nobody does it says remember Lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you that in that night there shall be two men in one bed and one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together and one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field and one shall be taken and the other left amen what uh uh what a uh awareness what a a a prophecy what what a realization that he's trying to give us that we need to grasp this realization and it's important that we grasp this realization each of us in our own lives because this world is designed to swallow you up to get to where you can't you you don't even look up you know it just got you down looking down looking down but the very scripture says look up clear Redemption is not in other words stand up look around you see where you're at because if you don't know where you are you can be lost yeah you may say well I'm not lost I know how to get home I know how to get here that ain't the journey you're on you're not on a journey here you're on another Journey that's taking to another land Another Place Another Kingdom and that there's a way there's a provided way to get there and if you're not looking for the signs that guide you down the way now if you kind of remember the way for us is in a physical way it's a spiritual way if I can say this it's a way of nature it's a way of attitude it's a way of atmosphere that's the way that he wants to see us in it's a it's the way of his spirit and his life because if the same life that was in him if the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ dwelleth in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body so there's a lot of distractions a lot of things trying to gather your interests trying to pull you away trying to deceive you because we were told in a very beautiful way it's like the the the seeds and the weeds and things they're deformers they grow up out of life and they get a hold of you and they deform you they they change your efforts they change your goals they they change the the the amount of time you give something pretty soon before you know it you're working 60 hours a week you're scratching to make a car payment you're bogged down with debt and and you're struggling to make a living and make a life and you're putting all your effort into a place that the word of God is telling us we're leaving remember this is a leaving message is not a staying message we need a guide we haven't been this way before so we're we're we're we're needing this great we're needing this uh great diet so the word of God is standing up and and telling us hey as when it gets to be like Sodom and Gomorrah when it gets to be like like in the days of Noah look for the the ministry of the son of man well how much farther for us who have seen the ministry of the son of man come here uh it would behoove us to have a real deep uh attitude check and attitude adjustment it would behoove us to have another good look at what our value structure is and what's important to us now I'm not trying to create any condemnation this morning or but I'm saying is is hey we're getting ready to leave how close are we to that time it would be important for us to check up and make sure that we're not carrying a heavier load then we need to carry I noticed one that anybody that's got a few years on them um when you go down life's Road you don't want any more junk you want to get rid of stuff get rid of this stuff get rid of that stuff you know what I mean so you know and you know Goodwill is probably one of our favorite places now not the shop to give away you know you don't need stuff you just don't need it you spend all this time and and I got tools in my shed and all kinds of tools and I don't even want to work anymore but you accumulate stuff well remember the natural types the what spiritual so we thought we've got to really sit back and ask yourself how much spiritual baggage do I have how many bad attitudes how many bad this how many bad thoughts how many bad approaches you know what what what are they you know what what concerns do I have what affections do I have what loves for the world do I have uh what are there things that I I really don't need to put my time and effort to or what things am I being left undone and so the scriptures are speaking out to us and saying hey one's going to be left one's going to be taken well I don't want the attitude well if one's going to be left fine one's going to be taken hey my attitude wait a minute what are the qualifications for the guy that's going to be taken what's he gonna be doing what what what's the Angel that's going to and fro marking the size in Christ okay if you know the Angels going by your life marking your life marking what your size are what your cries are what your interest is he knows exactly what's going on in your mind and in your life and he's reporting back we've heard many times the story of the Tudor right the holy spirit is our tutor is that right at he reports back to the father and he says my son is receiving the instructions of the word of God he's transforming he's not conforming to the world but he's transforming into the image of his father now he's reporting on you now you may not think that you may be so caught up with work so caught up with the job so caught up with your bills so caught up that it has totally slipped from your thinking that you're being reported nowadays they see everything they hear everything you say I don't know I think me and Leslie talked about something the other day and it showed up on her phone and she said they're listening to us well there's somebody a lot higher than them listening there's so many a lot higher in them watching you well actually you know it scares me when someone says did you tape up the camera on your computer I didn't know my computer had a camera you know you got to duct tape the thing why because this is the time that the angels are going to and fro marking marking the sons of gods are manifesting themselves why are they different why are their actions different why is their life different why are their affections different why are their desires different what makes you different What Makes You Different is your ability to discern the signs and the times oh ye hypocrites you can know all about the weather but you can't discern the signs of the times now let's take that personal this morning oh you hypocrite can you discern the signs of the time you recognize where we're at and what's going on and and the hypocrisy would not be in our morals the hypocrisy would be seen would be in our value system what's important to us the number one thing that should be important to us is making that rapture look let's let's just turn over a to another scripture before we uh make a few comments and then we're going to listen to a portion of God's word let's turn to Revelations the third chapter and the 14th verse to and let's read now this is really bringing it home to us right so this is our age so all the warning are prophesied warnings right it'll be like this it'll be like this it'll be like this they were prophesied warnings and now we've seen those warnings come to pass this now is a description of the prophecies that have been fulfilled all around you so how much more should we wake up one of the great terminologies you'll hear is Shake Yourself Shake Yourself what what did we listen to just a little bit ago and remember I believe the holy spirit is is saying these things to us because the Holy Spirit has one goal if I can say this forgive me speaking on his half and one objective and that's to bring you into remembrance of the word of God he didn't even come to speak of himself but to bring you into remembrance of the prophecies and the word that was spoken for our day and we can't get through a place where that's not it doesn't have Supreme importance in our life it's okay it's the time to say wait a minute I know I believe what's the word I hear so much today they call it being proactive are we proactive toward the things of God I I uh other terminologies I hear like getting ahead of the Curve you know or in other words getting get out getting out front of the issue well I think we ought to be the people that are out front we we should be on our toes because we we don't want the word of God tells us that we would neglect such a great salvation that we would let it slip and remember this is what we have to be afraid of and it's spiritual amnesia forgetting the importance just letting it slip by forgetting the importance of the word of God forgetting the importance of of being a diligent and and becoming as we know in these scriptures as we read them lukewarm and under the angel of the Church of ladyocia write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so these things were spoken to our messenger and he gave us a faithful and true witness right the same signs that Jesus used to vindicate his message the one that told us what would be here what to look for he used the same signs act he he and who was saying at the beginning of the creation of God in the beginning was the word what was the beginning all things that were made were made by him and nothing that was made that was not made by him so these things are are not man to man they're not they're not um uh history and Theology and and and tradition this is God speaking directly to you individually from his word saying this is now this is to you and that's one of the things our messenger told us is you've got to take it personally if you've got to take it for yourself it's an individual affair and if you if you don't then you're influenced by something and and so again you got to make sure that you're influenced by the word of God first and foremost and then you check the things that influence you by the word of God signs are given to give you an awareness to make you an aware and when the awareness rubs off you're not aware anymore you're not afraid anymore okay everything start to become common to you anybody that's involved in safety will tell you when things get common people get on unsafe you know I've seen it big signs that say high voltage well they just get used to working around it you know and pretty soon they got their hammers on their pouches and they got their wrenches in their back pocket high voltage high voltage and now you might as well put a sign saying electric chair but they get loose they start working instinctly they'll drop something and reach right under to something to try to grab it I remember my brother dropped a nut a bolt after he went down and he stuck it he stuck his hand under the panel down under the floor where the because piece of it wasn't and the only reason he didn't get zap is all the hair on his body started standing up what was it it was a total unawareness of the surroundings and the circumstance and the danger that's at hand and that's what the enemy wants to do he wants to lull us into thinking everything's peaceful and everything's safe and everything's good and the Very word of God says they say peace and safety and then sudden destruction strikes in so we're here this morning because this is the house of correction it's the house of reproof correction doesn't mean the punish correction means to alter our attitude to alter our habits the things that we're letting slip we go back and and reignite uh our passion because the very thing they lost in the first stage was they lost their first love and and I want to say this humbly as I can but my heart fears because I feel across the message that there's a a softening of love for this message that other things are attracting other voices other types of music and it's hard I I know people got upset at me because I wouldn't sing certain songs and and everything well go ahead go and sing those songs someplace up but you're going to meet it at the Judgment God don't like rock and roll reverence was what he liked really a reverence a respect an admonition and uplifting we don't sing songs because we like to beat and we like the music they've really got to be uh something there's there's songs maybe that we sing that I battle with personally but I try not to force my own things but if something's not drawing you closer to the Lord and you the first thing that attracts you is the sound of it get in his presence and and present it to him and let the spirit purify it for you because we've been warned now let me read this last two scriptures to you he says I Know Thy works doubt doubt are neither cold nor hot I would that were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spill thee out of my mouth what a warning I mean he means what he says and when the word of God gets numb to us then it doesn't shake us the way it it used to if it doesn't strike us it doesn't strike the fear of God in our heart the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God hey am I hot or cold am I lukewarm I don't want to be spilled out of his mouth it ought to the word of God ought to send a message to the kingdom of God that is within you if you haven't had anything work on your heart for a while that's because the flues and the power lines and the communications is all stopped up what's he saying get them unstopped don't go on with problems in your life don't condemn yourself because you've got them but don't get lukewarm that you're not dealing with them and then of course you know the rest of this because they'll sayeth I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not thou God are wretched and miserable poor blind and naked and then we know that he counsels us and one last scripture this morning and that is in Hebrews Hebrews the fifth chapter let's just start with the 11th verse and read these scriptures this morning he's of of whom we have many things to say and it's hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing oh my Paul said I'm trying to get something across to you but we're getting dull of hearing don't get all of hearing do you understand it I I know that what our kids get tired they get tiredness of trying to train them trying to tell us the same thing every don't go out there don't do that don't do this don't listen to that don't go hanging out down there don't don't do this don't do this and and Paul's sitting there I know you guys are getting dull of hearing but we can't get dull of hearing I would be remiss in my duties if I let us all get dull of hearing where all we had is a good party going on here you know let's have service in the morning and let's go picnic and barbecue and play basketball in the afternoon all is well no we've got communion tonight communion is is hardly in the message anymore once or twice a year go read the communion book look all that the prophet of God says what it what it is when you go to communion it's you putting yourself up against the urum Thunder for you to judge your life well what's the easiest way to get away from that is don't put yourself in front of it right don't go to nothing that's going to condemn you don't do it don't do nothing but the beautiful part of communion is the holy spirit promises in communion to be there and convict your heart being convicted by the holy spirit is one of the most wonderful parts of a Christian's life in fact what did he even say the Holy Spirit was to do it was to convictus of sin of unbelief well I don't want something in me that's going to keep me out right convict Me Lord it's a blessing if if if if you get Dolly hearing you know hey I don't want to get tired of hearing about communion no you know what come to communion come to communion I didn't want to I'm not didn't come to preach about communion but it come up to me right at this moment but if you co-read the book he said if you don't do these three ordinances you will not be there sorry Give Me Your Righteous program don't take communion you ain't going sorry sorry sorry sorry I don't mean you're all sorry but it's the truth we don't want that no more you know what we want you're the bride you're elected you're going you can't go to hell your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life the prophet of God said we've taken Grace and turned it into disgrace oh my God if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life you will be at Communion sorry if you're not at Communion there's no evidence that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you are fooling yourself the scripture says away seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is death you've got your own righteousness which by the way is filthy rags he's provided away he's provided a way of Escape and the way of Escape is full obedience to the word of God so I mean I'm going to have hard enough time getting in myself because I know what a rascal I am but I'm not going to have the fact that I failed to preach the gospel on my charge let's just read again this beautiful scripture here we're reading that was I mean Hebrews the fifth chapter I think we started um here um first fifth calculator verse what did we go to 11. it says for when for the time he ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God that's pretty straightforward don't you think for all of us who feel that we know it all we're also self-righteous he's saying hey you ought to be teaching these things well we've got to be taught them again I I'm almost feeling when I start looking around wait a minute what happened to the ABCs what happened to things that Prophet taught about high heels about shorts about haircuts about about pulling us about being the church on time about fellowshipping with the things of the world it's almost like we're sitting back and and without knowing it we're falling asleep we're becoming lukewarm we're becoming self-confident we're becoming to think that it's all sewed up you know what we're doing we're falling into the Slumber of the sleeping virgin but we want to wake up and what what trim our lamps that we can what See Clearly that's what we want we want we want to see clearly we want to be able to recognize what's transpiring doesn't ask what he said he said teachers the principles of the Oracle of God and are becomes such as that have need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness for he is as a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil amen if am I making myself clear okay we've got to put our spiritual eyeglasses on we've got to come to an awareness there's there's no need uh uh running and jumping and screaming and at and having a good time if we can't see the message we're going to listen to for 20 minutes now is called recognizing your day and its message the importance of recognizing your day we just read several scriptures about Discerning about recognizing about not being able to see what's transpiring and I'm not talking about only the general picture I'm talking about the picture of your own life Discerning what's coming into your life what's drawing into your life what's coming into your life can influence your screen where is this having reason of exercise where is this decision going to take me you know we don't we don't think of decisions I remember a friend of mine telling me that he went on vacation so he told his son he said whatever you don't drive my car well they left what do you think the boy did first thing he did he took the car well he was driving the car around he drove it for a few days and then one day coming in pulling in the drive he heard a scrape and he thought oh my goodness I wrecked the car so he parked the car in a garage he got out and looked and there was a great big scrape on the side of the car so he said oh my goodness I'm in trouble so he grabbed the car and he took it down to the dealership and he went and got all kinds of money and paid him for a rush job and and everything it got him fixed up and all that and got the den all in there and looked around it was all clean he sat in there well then the dad come home he said he looked around he said wow he said did you drive my car he said no he said well then how did the dent get fixed that I put in it before I left see you don't even know what you're causing and then we try to fix things and adjust things and do things and make excuses for a thing no it could it's seriously a Time now I'd like to just read these statements to you this morning before we listen to our just 20 more minutes this is from a message God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him all these things that scriptures we've read are warnings the sign is a warning it's a message it's a warning lady Elsia age is a warning the times of Noah the times of Sodom and Gomorrah the morals all these things another great message was preached was the flashing red lights of the sign of his coming all these things now are things the trouble with it is is these are things that he's revealed to us that leave us without excuse that's the problem you can't plead ignorance you might be able to plead selfishness or self-love or lover of pleasure but you've got no excuse for missing the warnings and packing the wrong approach and attitude I'm not trying to create condemnation this morning I'm not preaching condemnation I'm preaching an awareness that we've got to recognize that we've got to be more aware of the signs than everything they're flashing everywhere some things fixing to happen take heed make adjustments in in yourself in your spirit in your being in your diet spiritual diet he says now everyone has this we might say well this fella died without a warning no no no no no God never you don't know what was in that man's heart you don't know what's been a going on in his life God never brings any man to his death without first warning him about it telling him if something a preparation God is sovereign he knocks at the heart of every man giving him the opportunity to come he's knocking this morning at your heart giving you the opportunity to come back into fellowship with the message of the hour which is what's the only thing that can guide you it's personal all of you have access to listen to the tapes I don't know uh uh who you live with those of you that are home I don't know whether you have unbelieving parents unbelieving spouses unbelieving relatives I I don't care but there's not one person in here that doesn't have the ability to listen to the word of God read it if you need to but that's that is your thing because this message is a preparation and the warnings that were in this message about the this indictment of Jesus Christ the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ the indictment the flashing red lights the God of this evil age uh Satan's Eden all these great warnings that went out to tell us that don't get caught up we're leaving well Peter even dealt with it they say where is the sign of his coming everything Remains the Same they didn't have these things Paul said these certain things have to come to pass first the son is the Son of Perdition has to be revealed not only has he been revealed we've seen this whole history from the first horse rider all the way through till the end the seals are open the Mysteries reveal so he's done his part of preparing us the question is are we recognizing is there a recognition going on in our lives he says giving him the opportunity to come now he might he might worn away and turn it down and shake his head to it and walk away and say ah is just a funny feeling I'll get over it but anyhow it was God speaking to him you know another word for that funny feeling is conviction if you're sitting here this morning and say you know something I really haven't been on fire for God I've been lukewarm I haven't been reading I've been looking at everything I've been looking at boys I've been looking at girls I've been looking at Fashions my heart's every place else you know get your priorities right God first family second you third it's not just a funny feeling this morning I'm trying to be as cordial and nights as I can but there are people that are in danger of the Judgment because not because they're bad because they're just getting so lukewarm that he can't deny his word if you say you're sorry he's just in faithful to forgive you because he can't deny his word but if you become lukewarm he's got a dispute out of his mouth and how many excuse me how many parables could we go through we've got it we've got so one-sided that we don't think we can do anything wrong no you will reap what you sow let's just finish up and then I'll finish up he says God never brings judgment upon the Earth without first giving the people warning God never does nothing without declaring it first what he's going to do and he gives people a choice you can do right or wrong see God never changes his nature his program can never change from what he started with because he's infinite and he is programmed in his ideas are all perfect and if he would change that would show that he had learned more so being infinite he cannot learn more his first decision is always perfect and there's nothing can ever change it now we find out that his nature here to always to warn a man before judgment to warn a nation before judgment and so forth he always gives his warning a reminder to we of a responsibility we are responsible and God has put us here on the earth for a reason and that reason that he has put us here for we are responsible to him for that reason he put you here for the rapture how many believes God put you here for the rapture you got a responsibility to the Rapture it's not something that's just going to happen it's there's a responsibility to it you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do see if you don't if we went to work for a man and he give you a job on a ranch or something other and you just went out to the barn and just sat down out there and said well see you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you're working for a man find out what your duty is well how about for God amen so we're going to turn over to paragraph 64 of the message recognizing your day and its message your responsibility to recognize the day and the message to your day you're responsible for that hey don't shirk your responsibility what do you want to find out where who you are you receiving the message from what they are warning you about the evidence and Vindication of what they are warning you about and remember that it's only warnings are only to certain individuals this warning is only for the bride you have to listen for 20 minutes and then we'll we'll close as you listen to your messenger trying to stir you up to recognizing the day in the message and your responsibility I believe you'll love this little portion of tape God richly bless you this morning recognizing the day and its message God bless you that in the third day we'll be gathered again after two days in the third day we will be gathered again receive life in his sight promises they are perfectly wrote on the wall we see where we are living now in the Homeland waiting for the Feast of the trumpets are the recognizing of the atonement and to uh wait for the coming to mourn for their rejection of the first time that they rejected it they're in a Homeland for that waiting what are they all everything is positionally placed the minister of the Gospel I can't see one thing left but the going of the Bride and the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what's happened they were bound scattered I mean they were scattered blinded and out gathered what's left the bride to be taken out of the way waiting for the going of her bride so their prophets of Revelations 11 can call them to the Feast of the trumpet to make them to recognize what they have done remember right between those seals came forth The Sixth Seal and that was 144 000 Chosen and called and between the sixth and seventh trumpet Revelations 11 appears right there exactly in line with the Sixth Seal what to do what was it to do and this wants to bring forth two witnesses Moses analyze prophets which the Jews only believe their Prophets and they'll come forth with the sign of the prophets and their work will be that of the Prophet amen for they did exactly what showing one thing that man when you die but whatever when you leave this world your nature doesn't change if you're a liar now you'll be a liar there if you're headed here you'll be headed there if you're a doubter here you'd be a counter there man and women it's time to shake yourselves and examine yourselves and see where we are standing for death does not change it they've been gone for 2 000 years Moses for a minute about 2500 years and Elijah for uh ever since almost 2500 years has Elijah been gone and Moses have been gone and here they return with the same nature and do the same things death doesn't do nothing to a man but change his Dwelling Place doesn't change your nature doesn't change your faith doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling place so which away your nature is this morning if you're a daughter of God's word you'd be a doubter over there I don't care how old you are how you live and how could you live it wouldn't change you one bit to die just your dwelling place and if you can't accept the whole word of God the way it's written you wouldn't do it there so don't worry you won't be there you've got to accept it in this fullness and the power of His Vindication and the revelation of what it is that you become a part of it it's only his word that he'll raise up as he did his word on the first Easter morning only his word came forth and those who had died in his word believing his word and Vindicated his word notice now that's been 2700 years ago notice they were scattered they were blinded and now they've been gathered now the next thing is that they are to receive life and the Gentiles are called out the bride's ready the Rapture is at hand can we realize that can we actually believe that is it a story that's been told is it a myth to us is it a something that sounds real is it something that we outside can't believe or is it something that's in US that's part of us but it's more than life to us What attitude do we sit in this morning in this Tabernacle remember it'll be a small flock that receives it now in the Homeland waiting for the trumpets now waiting for the going of their own Pride so that Revelations 11 can be fulfilled the church age has ceased the seals has been opened that prove what they left out in the church age and the message has been given Israel is on the scene Hallelujah ready why are the beasts of trumpets all you men in other lands or you'll hear this tape can't you wake up my brother or does it blind you would you throw it out and call it false prophecy when it's Vindicated right before you by the worrying by the time by the peoples and by the Holy Spirit who wrote it it's Vindicated both nicely spiritually materially everything that he said is fulfilled and proven Israel in her land drove him in there hurting him in there like sheep the Wolves got entered and run back to safety to their own land remember Israel's only promised to be blessed as long as she was in her land God never blesses Israel outside of the land Abraham went outside the land was condemned everyone that leaves the land is condemned God only can bless Israel when she stays in her Homeland and she's there now as a nation and the church is called she's just only waiting for the Rapture of the Bride take it out the seals are open it's revealed to us see what they left off you either want to debate and fuss about the serpent seed and water baptism and so forth you're blind and it don't know it God of this world and you don't know it wonder I had such a time this morning fighting to them pressures so their profits can be revealed and this last day you can't do it through the trumpet of the Feast of the trumpets he said through Hosea I have hewed I watch Israel is talking to you I have hewed or in other words I have chopped chop them out through the prophets that's how God does his people he chopped them out from the rest of the Nations amen what man just two eight sword amen is wired he chopped him this nation from the Nations he chopped his Nation from the Nations by the prophets his Vindicated word so has he chopped his bride from the denominations by his words [Music] promised America 4 in the last day chopped out his bride humor from the rest of the churches you know this bride shut down His prophets fill with His prophets for the word chop in Israel separate yourself from the rest of them look at when they want to act like the rest of them they came to the prophet Samuel he said have I ever took your money have I ever spoke to you anything in the name of the Lord but what happened I said no that's that's right but we still want a king that's the way the churches is dead oh we believe the word it's all right but you know that we say we should do this I don't care what they say the word is right waiting just chop them out through the prophets what time is it brother what time is it minister you see the time of the day and the sign you're living under can you understand do you see it everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining Minister's crying us reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper now I know the editor and I know the people they're godly people very fine brother sister Moore of the herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field Harold of his tummy but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet get how many reads it you know who you see it all time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great break-in of the day that's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want to create Awakening they're crying bleeding yet they will be awakened they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way yeah they know something's supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you that's the same thing they did in the old days they'll be the coming Messiah they believe that there'd be a forerunner come but it was right on them and they didn't know it they didn't recognize it they be there or come a forerunner they would forerun them aside and they cut his head off a killer Messiah because it was prophesied that they'd be blinded Hosea Said So In The Same Spirit that spoke to Hosea spoke to John and said the church in this last days would be naked and blind amen and would put him outside the church they failed to see those prophecies fulfilled but be in there they realize that something has got to happen they just don't get it they don't realize it much like the Jews of Old Times blind and laosia Rich's theology hostile with the church hustle towards the message look how hustle of Jews was were John look how hostile he was with Jesus when he was the very one that they claimed that they were looking for I believe we blowed a fuse I suppose that cuts the tape recorders off too it doesn't all right they were hostile towards the message what happens is that so much momentum each one of you all are a heating unit there's no way to keep the church perfectly normal and though under those times the cause you see each one of you are 98 BTUs normally and you just don't sit there like that you're constantly putting out Heat there's enough air and you're now to freeze the place up but with a heating unit going forth you you can't do it notice hostile but now like the Jews of old blind and they're at lady asea they're naked miserable wretched and don't know it day of riches great theological teachings great education and now they have become hostile towards the message they want nothing to do with it just like it was back in the days when Jesus of Nazareth was on Earth the reason people in Noah's day did not go into the ark because they never recognized the message nor the messenger that's the only reason they perished is because they didn't recognize the hour that they were living they didn't recognize that God would deal with sin as he promised he would you destroy a man from the face of the Earth he had prophesied it he meant it and he means that today the same as he did Dan but the people instead of being favorable towards Noah he was considered a wild man they didn't believe him to be a prophet you know Jesus he known self told us how they scoffed in the days of Noah made fun of him called him a fanatic and want more but they didn't recognize their hour they didn't recognize the day they didn't recognize the sign they didn't recognize the message they didn't recognize the messenger but put him from their midst and laughed at him Jesus says it Wows in the days of Noah with Israel in her land and everything sitting down the message is just perfectly moving in what day are we living brother where are we at they didn't know the day they didn't know that's reason they missed it is because they didn't recognize it they were like the day like someone like the people today by scientific proofs by Educational Systems by theological seminaries and things that blinded them in that day it's done the same thing today it's blinded them again and also the Simplicity Simplicity of the message and the messenger Noah wasn't scientific he wasn't an educated man he's a poor farmer humble with a simple message it was too simple for their High Learning so is it today God always makes it simple to get the people who will believe and trust him it's a different just a different message but the same God I want you to believe it and understand that God has spoken Jesus said they scoffed at his Prophet Noah and as his scoffed in that day so will they do it again at his coming they would do the same thing that's the reason that Pharaoh drowned it in the sea he never recognized his day he never recognized what was going on he was too tuck up in the achievements of his scientific age to build cities with slave labor he was too he was too busy to recognize the opportunity that he had and he turned God's Prophet messenger out into the wilderness didn't recognize it that's the reason that if things went the way they did he never recognized it if he would have only recognized the promised word of God to that people and if the church is today would only recognize if the churches would only recognize the word of God that's made this promise for this hour to the people they wouldn't perish if America could only recognize the Constitution as she brought up she wouldn't be willing to take Bibles out of the schools take the name of God off of coins and pledge allegiance under God but she doesn't realize it wow ah the blood of those precious boys has died on the fields for this privilege they're forgotten their dust but there's one who does remember [Music] the shed of the blood of the prophets the cost that had taken to bring this gospel to us today now the thousands have been eaten by lions have thrown into the dens have been solder sundered burnt crucified God Rest in the house he said the church has forgot their Prophets don't need them anymore they claim but God knows he's got to Heaven he uses people by his word but it's too old-fashioned to them in this day they don't recognize it that's reason they're in the condition they are that's the reason they're naked miserable blind ratchet don't know it because they don't recognize the hour that we're living they don't notice it Moses he recognized his day and his calling when he saw the promise of God's word for that day Vindicated he knew then and realized what he was and what he's to do by the promised word so he didn't fear what anybody said he wasn't ashamed of his message whoever priesthood ever payroll everything ever Authority disagreed with him but he recognized when he saw that light that Pillar of Fire hang in that bush I spoke to him the word that was promised for that day and said I've called you to go do it he feared not the the great threats of the king he went down to bring those people to an exodus like the word of God had promised see the promised indicated he made the people ready for their Exodus when when he saw the promise of God Vindicated remember he ran with his theology he ran with his with his training but when he saw the word of God made manifest he saw it Vindicated I am that I am then he didn't care what anybody said he didn't fear what Pharaoh would do with him he didn't fear what the rest of them would do he only feared God that he might misunderstand God or some way that he might misunderstand God he didn't fear the people and what they would say or what they would do he only feared God after he recognized that it was the word of God he couldn't understand how a man like him would be sent down there but when he recognized by the Vindicated word what it was then he didn't fear the king's Commandments if you'd only recognize if we today can only recognize Moses recognizing when he seen the word Vindicated seeing the Vindication made prove he was ready for the Exodus for the people it's called recognizing its day in its message it's very straightforward message I hope that you understood what the messenger is saying and you know I uh you have to understand that uh I've just I'm obligated to share with you what I feel God puts on my heart that's important for us to consider and again just in closing of the musicians would come um and each one to realize this morning that I counsel thee to buy of me isaf that thou mayest see and

education all civilization in everything trying to Blind you ask God for isaph I counsel thee to buy of me isap that thou mayest see White rhinaman that thy nakedness doesn't appear and gold try it in
