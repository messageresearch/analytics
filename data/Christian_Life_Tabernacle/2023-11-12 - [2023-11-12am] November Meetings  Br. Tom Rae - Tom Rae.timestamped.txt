[49:07] [Music]
[49:11] path though
[49:14] father many times
[49:16] we don't know which way to turn you've
[49:19] never forsaken
[49:21] us and once again this morning we ask
[49:25] that
[49:27] you would so stand in our presence that
[49:32] each one of us would come to know
[49:35] you that we would become closer to you
[49:40] Hallelujah that our relationship with
[49:42] you would
[49:43] grow Lord we ask you to bless us this
[49:46] morning in Jesus precious and wonderful
[49:50] name we pray
[49:53] amen amen God bless you you may be
[49:57] seated
[50:02] amen we've
[50:05] certainly had a time with uh the flu
[50:08] roll rolling through us and uh it's good
[50:12] to see slowly people getting back out to
[50:14] the house of the Lord and and uh
[50:18] overcoming still of some uh down I'm
[50:22] starting to do better and I I knew I
[50:24] would have to do better with some of the
[50:27] prayers that have been said on my behalf
[50:30] and uh I got texts that said be
[50:35] healed I said
[50:38] amen and uh so uh it uh certainly uh is
[50:44] wonderful uh about uh the goodness of
[50:49] God you know I I've just I've been
[50:51] reading in Galatians 3 and it's uh
[50:54] starting to mean a lot to me when Paul
[50:57] told the church he said you know how did
[50:59] you receive the spirit did you receive
[51:03] it by the law or did you receive it by
[51:06] faith and uh to think that faith comes
[51:12] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[51:15] God that that it's not something that
[51:18] you muster up it's something that's
[51:20] quickened to you that you hear something
[51:23] and and it it connects with something
[51:26] inside of you and Faith Comes rising to
[51:30] the surface and that's what Paul wanted
[51:34] the uh Church to remember that it it's
[51:39] don't move back away from faith and all
[51:42] of a sudden think you're going to become
[51:44] perfect in your lives you know what I
[51:47] mean that you're going to do something
[51:49] no if you want to have faith you've got
[51:52] to keep hearing the word of God Amen
[51:56] if it's not it becomes a different kind
[51:58] of faith it becomes a faith I believe
[52:01] this I believe that I believe that and
[52:04] Faith isn't an I
[52:06] believe amen faith is an understanding
[52:09] of what's going to happen amen and I
[52:13] believe that this message is calling out
[52:15] a bride how many beli
[52:18] that how many believe that all what the
[52:20] prophet did and all that he came here to
[52:23] do had an end result
[52:25] it was a purpose for it it was to
[52:28] accomplish something it was going to
[52:30] cause something to happen and so we've
[52:33] kind of put in our heart for this
[52:37] meeting it was the realization that in
[52:41] an hour that there's so many voices and
[52:43] so many fingers pointing in so many
[52:46] directions and we're flooded with
[52:49] decision making and and it's hard I
[52:53] remember one time Aaron preached the
[52:55] a a message my son Aaron about choices
[52:58] and he said yes he says nowadays there
[53:02] is 127 varieties of
[53:06] water that you can choose from there's
[53:10] even water that makes you
[53:14] smart well I've drinking about 25
[53:17] gallons of that and I'm still Dumber in
[53:20] a mud fence you know what I mean and
[53:23] there's energy water and there there's
[53:25] you know this water and that water and
[53:27] glacier water and hund you can't even
[53:30] walk up and get a glass of water without
[53:33] being slammed with so many
[53:37] choices and it's it's a burden uh the
[53:41] world's under but yet by faith you've
[53:46] made a choice and by faith you found the
[53:50] light and by faith you found the path
[53:54] and by faith you make the choice of what
[53:58] direction you're going in and that's
[54:01] what uh the Lord put on my heart is
[54:05] which way shall we
[54:07] go there's many ways offered out there
[54:10] now sure many movements many uh uh
[54:16] voices many
[54:19] personalities and and a a lot of choice
[54:22] lights be which way should we lean
[54:25] what what should we get involved in
[54:27] shall we seek gifts shall we seek this
[54:30] shall we seek that and uh where should
[54:33] we put our effort where should we put
[54:35] our time what is it that God wants from
[54:39] us as a people and if not if you never
[54:43] come in conflict and and you never come
[54:45] to the place where you start asking
[54:48] yourself these questions where am I
[54:51] going what what's my effort what's my
[54:54] life what's my thought process then you
[54:57] end up on that sea of just drifting and
[55:01] being tossed to and fro by every wind of
[55:05] Doctrine and your sails never catch the
[55:08] wind of the spirit and you never start
[55:11] moving towards the Eternal goal and I I
[55:15] I like I believe in my heart I believe
[55:17] that we're in a war and we're fighting
[55:19] for the Rapture amen exactly right amen
[55:23] if there's anything that Satan does want
[55:25] you to do is
[55:29] leave CU you're the whole thing that's
[55:31] holding this whole thing together and if
[55:34] he can get us to stay then he is he has
[55:40] more life and more time and we have a
[55:43] promise that the days would be shortened
[55:46] L any flesh would be saved and boy if
[55:49] you're ever seeing a time sure of things
[55:52] that just come upon the Earth that can
[55:55] you imagine taking a whole generation of
[55:58] young people and youth and actually
[56:01] getting them to such a mental
[56:04] confusion that they're not sure whether
[56:07] they're boys or
[56:10] girls that's some that imagine the
[56:15] oppression of the Mind of a young person
[56:19] that's got to be put through that that's
[56:23] the
[56:23] devil that that's who we fight sure and
[56:27] we're an army are fitted and joined
[56:30] together and we've come to fight the
[56:32] fight so we ask the lord lord we need
[56:35] guidance we need to know what way would
[56:38] you have us to go what direction would
[56:40] you have us to turn our hearts to what
[56:44] are the things that we should set our
[56:47] mind on and not just as
[56:50] individuals uh but as a as a people and
[56:55] I believe the Lord started answering
[56:57] that when brother Murphy began to preach
[56:59] to us and he began to tell us you know
[57:01] God's jealous over
[57:04] you amen doesn't mean he wants what
[57:07] you've got it means he's
[57:09] consumed with what's best for
[57:12] you amen he he he he wants to Shepherd
[57:16] you he wants to supply all your needs he
[57:20] wants to be your God can you imagine
[57:23] someone just begging let me be to you
[57:26] what I am I can do for you exceedingly
[57:29] and abundantly above which you can even
[57:32] ask their thing and I'm here I want to
[57:34] do it I want to be your God I want to
[57:37] lead you I want to guide you I want to
[57:39] protect you I'm Jehovah Gyra I want to
[57:42] provide for you and as brother Murphy
[57:45] said God earned those
[57:47] titles you understand he did something
[57:51] that caused that title to be placed upon
[57:54] him he provided so he became Jehovah
[57:57] Gyra and our it stirred us up and uh and
[58:03] and he he went on to talk about that not
[58:06] if that if you're jealous and you're
[58:08] jealous of God that jealousy produces a
[58:13] Zeal and and you become zealous and what
[58:16] a cry for us to get back into the
[58:19] message to get back on fire not to be
[58:22] ashamed of it because it's the power of
[58:25] God under salvation and and and that
[58:29] that great hidden
[58:30] beatitude of of the Lord that simply
[58:33] says blessed is he who is not offended
[58:37] in me and what a
[58:39] call for us to fall back in love with
[58:44] the message of the hour what it stands
[58:46] for what it the works the Vindication
[58:49] the truths that it had and and and just
[58:53] almost like the Lord speaking to us and
[58:56] and uh how that God that gave you faith
[59:02] and what a call from the spirit for us
[59:05] as a body of Believers to all come back
[59:08] together and start falling back in love
[59:11] and bringing ourselves under the uh that
[59:14] voice for our day and that stirred me up
[59:17] and then how beautiful uh brother
[59:20] Michael F followed right behind
[59:23] it amen and talking about the the great
[59:27] parable of the great wedding Feast that
[59:30] we've been invited to and and and just
[59:34] walking down through that that Parable
[59:37] with us and how how that he brought out
[59:40] I thought it was fantastic how he
[59:42] brought out the man that was in his own
[59:45] garment you know the man that sits in
[59:48] church but he comes to church but he's
[59:50] not part of the
[59:51] body he's not part of the ministry you
[59:54] know uh he's he's he's what the pastor
[59:59] has to say but uh he measures it himself
[1:00:03] and he analysises it and decides what
[1:00:06] he'll take and what he won't take you
[1:00:09] know he just he he just hasn't joined up
[1:00:13] to it you know he he doesn't want to be
[1:00:15] fitted in with the brothers and around
[1:00:18] him or the sisters around him he's got
[1:00:20] his own life he's got his own walk he's
[1:00:23] got his own dress he's got his own
[1:00:25] clothes he's got his own thinking
[1:00:27] basically in the midst of the whole
[1:00:29] church he's doing his own thing and I
[1:00:33] think how the spirit of God spoke out
[1:00:35] hey I brought you together amen I'm the
[1:00:39] god that assembled you I'm the god that
[1:00:43] called you I'm the god that wants you to
[1:00:46] be a part of one another because they'll
[1:00:49] know that you are my disciples by your
[1:00:52] love one for another and how that he
[1:00:55] went on to preach to us about that
[1:00:59] there's a
[1:01:00] garment that we have to
[1:01:02] wear and the great tailor of that
[1:01:06] garment thought it was beautiful yes was
[1:01:10] the word of God for the hour the elaser
[1:01:13] that came to dress us and he started
[1:01:16] quoting messages that started sewing the
[1:01:20] Garment together and that the bride
[1:01:22] would had adorned herself amen and made
[1:01:26] herself ready yes and oh what a call of
[1:01:30] the spirit to the church hey church
[1:01:33] start making yourself ready amen start
[1:01:36] putting on the Garment start getting
[1:01:39] dressed and and and the kindness of the
[1:01:41] Lord speaking to us it's not too late
[1:01:45] you can start
[1:01:47] today you you don't know what I mean you
[1:01:50] can't take those filthy rags off
[1:01:52] yourself but you can present yourself to
[1:01:55] him say Here I Am Lord dress me speak to
[1:01:59] me amen and he's going to cloth each one
[1:02:03] of you as his bride many membered bride
[1:02:08] one husband all throughout the
[1:02:11] scriptures and types in in this in the
[1:02:15] Bible and what called to us to return to
[1:02:19] a dedicated life and just starting to
[1:02:23] put the full armor of God on and and and
[1:02:26] to start getting the word of God back in
[1:02:29] our lives and to apply the token and
[1:02:33] where we're short then talk it over with
[1:02:37] them and and stay in his presence and
[1:02:40] let them do for you exceedingly and
[1:02:42] abundantly above what you can even ask
[1:02:45] or think and and I it just kind of
[1:02:48] brought us up I just see the Lord
[1:02:50] pulling us and pulling me personally
[1:02:53] David get more dedicated dig deeper into
[1:02:57] the word of God read it listen I'm going
[1:03:01] to speak to you I have things to show
[1:03:04] you that you don't know and uh um and I
[1:03:09] have to say yes Lord and make myself
[1:03:13] available and hear you him I got to look
[1:03:16] and and let him mold
[1:03:19] me just the way and and and like I said
[1:03:23] I didn't want this meeting to be a
[1:03:25] meeting dealing with
[1:03:28] individuals but I wanted it to be a
[1:03:30] meeting dealing with us as a
[1:03:32] church those that come here and
[1:03:36] fellowship together that we as a body of
[1:03:41] Believers would have a light that Shin
[1:03:44] that our licks of fire would become
[1:03:47] brighter and brighter and brighter and I
[1:03:51] just thought the Lord has brought us and
[1:03:53] now we've come
[1:03:56] to another
[1:03:59] time for God to
[1:04:01] speak amen because Faith cometh by
[1:04:05] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:04:08] so we have another time
[1:04:11] in in which the Lord
[1:04:14] could uh once again tell us of the way
[1:04:17] that he wants us to go we've heard what
[1:04:20] he said thus
[1:04:21] far and so I think that it's just a
[1:04:24] continual of thing of getting us going
[1:04:27] in the right path because wide is the
[1:04:30] way to
[1:04:32] destruction and narrow is the way and
[1:04:36] few be that find it and and and I don't
[1:04:41] want to miss it
[1:04:43] now I've come too far to miss it now I
[1:04:48] don't even want to think what the
[1:04:51] results are going to be of a wrong turn
[1:04:56] in this hour and if we could all take
[1:04:59] that
[1:05:00] seriously into our heart this morning
[1:05:03] and know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:05:07] that the Lord is here this morning to
[1:05:10] speak to us
[1:05:12] amen now he may use brother Tom this
[1:05:16] morning whom I love
[1:05:18] dearly but I look past that
[1:05:22] Veil and I believe that there's going to
[1:05:25] be something that the Lord is wanting to
[1:05:31] tell us and you say why do you know that
[1:05:34] God's because I
[1:05:40] ask and the word says if you ask you
[1:05:44] shall
[1:05:47] receive I asked the
[1:05:50] Lord if he would send brother Murphy
[1:05:54] brother Mike and brother Tom to preach
[1:05:58] this last meeting by the grace of God
[1:06:02] we'll have in this
[1:06:06] building and Tom looked at me and he
[1:06:08] said it ain't
[1:06:14] happening I say yeah all
[1:06:19] right you don't know how impr profitable
[1:06:22] that what's happened
[1:06:25] it's like the Coupee de gr to get almost
[1:06:28] the full ministry of that church down
[1:06:32] here God had to create a conflict

[1:21:03] figure out how many years but we're
[1:21:04] going over 10 or 12 or whatever years
[1:21:07] and and look at me look at me I'm still
[1:21:11] white I I've been white haired since 35
[1:21:15] I guess but one day we'll be changed in
[1:21:18] a in a moment amen okay John 14 please
[1:21:24] St John chapter 14 Brother David
[1:21:27] mentioned this last night we're always
[1:21:29] looking as preachers we're always
[1:21:30] looking for
[1:21:32] confirmations and uh Michael knows I got
[1:21:35] up from the table the other day and I
[1:21:38] said we just waiting for that time when
[1:21:40] the spark
[1:21:42] Sparks and by the grace of God the spark
[1:21:44] sparked and then Brother David takes my
[1:21:48] scripture so I'll just pay the bill
[1:21:50] we'll go home okay
[1:21:53] John 1 uh 141 please let not your heart
[1:21:57] be troubled you believe in God believe
[1:21:59] also in me in my father's house are many
[1:22:02] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:22:05] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[1:22:08] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:22:10] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:22:13] myself that where I am there ye may be
[1:22:18] also I love that scripture that where he
[1:22:21] is you will be also
[1:22:25] amen and whether I go I want you to make
[1:22:29] special note of ye know okay I want you
[1:22:33] to get this now and whether I
[1:22:36] go ye know and the way you
[1:22:41] know Thomas said unto him now notice
[1:22:45] here Thomas gets a lot like Brother
[1:22:48] David said he took my whole sermon in
[1:22:50] five
[1:22:50] minutes Thomas gets a rap my name's
[1:22:54] Thomas by the
[1:22:57] way Thomas said unto the Lord we know
[1:23:01] not whether thou goest I wanted to take
[1:23:05] special note there because you know
[1:23:07] brother Braham said in one place he said
[1:23:08] you got to dig a Little
[1:23:10] Deeper it's not like reading a
[1:23:13] newspaper you got to dig a Little Deeper
[1:23:16] when you read the Bible you know you
[1:23:18] take that Bible read that verse look at
[1:23:21] that verse what is Jesus trying to say
[1:23:23] here what is it meaning whether I go you
[1:23:27] I go you know and the way you
[1:23:31] know what that's the Lord speaking isn't
[1:23:34] it that's did did I read that
[1:23:37] right did I say he this is what he's
[1:23:43] saying and whether I go you
[1:23:46] know and the way you know so that's God
[1:23:51] speaking letting you know you
[1:23:55] know that's right so here comes Thomas
[1:23:59] and he said unto the Lord we know not
[1:24:03] whether what are you talking about the
[1:24:07] Lord just said you
[1:24:09] know right you know what's your question
[1:24:12] this morning right there should not be a
[1:24:15] question yes of where you're
[1:24:19] going and we'll be looking at that as we
[1:24:22] go
[1:24:22] and what the Thomas said we know not
[1:24:26] whether thou goest and how can we know
[1:24:31] the way those are all important notes
[1:24:35] right okay those are all important
[1:24:38] notes you've ever had somebody that
[1:24:41] knows it
[1:24:42] all and you call them a know it
[1:24:46] all you know people look at at at you
[1:24:50] and they they have a question
[1:24:53] and we by the grace of God by the word
[1:24:56] of God have the answer that's right and
[1:24:59] so the word of God is our
[1:25:02] answer so now we're going to look at the
[1:25:04] scripture to let you know that you
[1:25:08] know Hallelujah where the bride's going
[1:25:12] without
[1:25:14] question am I
[1:25:16] going he says what did he what did we
[1:25:20] read whether I go you know and the way
[1:25:23] you know Thomas said unto him Lord we
[1:25:26] know not whether thou goest and how can
[1:25:30] we know the way Jesus said unto him I
[1:25:35] am the way you want to know the way
[1:25:38] Christ is the way the word is the way
[1:25:43] he's your absolute there's no man
[1:25:47] there's not no Doctrine there is nothing
[1:25:51] that is your absolute outside this word
[1:25:54] am all right are we established are we
[1:25:58] your idea I care I care nothing on how
[1:26:01] you

[1:30:01] don't care if it's
[1:30:04] uh people start them or what people get
[1:30:08] attracted to to waste their
[1:30:13] time Satan in every
[1:30:16] area will try to absorb your
[1:30:19] thoughts and pervert it
[1:30:22] in at the same time same time it's never
[1:30:25] like you're doing something and finally
[1:30:27] you get perverted his intent is
[1:30:30] everything outside of the Gospel is to
[1:30:32] pervert your
[1:30:34] thinking so that when you read
[1:30:38] something it's a distraction in your
[1:30:40] mind already you can't even
[1:30:46] concentrate I had a statistics one time
[1:30:50] and I I I should have brought it but I
[1:30:51] didn't plan on going down this route but
[1:30:54] I'll since I know the statistic of it
[1:30:57] they said man's attention span at this
[1:31:01] point in time is the attention span of a
[1:31:06] goldfish you say that's
[1:31:08] funny that's bad that's really bad so
[1:31:12] they're saying human it used to be that
[1:31:15] you could hold somebody for 10 or 15
[1:31:17] minutes in their in their in a in a span
[1:31:21] of
[1:31:22] conversation then it got down to a
[1:31:24] minute and now it's it's down to 8.6
[1:31:32] seconds eight minutes and six
[1:31:35] seconds that you can actually I've
[1:31:37] already used up my
[1:31:41] time Billy you have a song you want to
[1:31:44] close isn't that amazing they can get it
[1:31:47] down to a statistic that you sit here
[1:31:49] and somewhere already you're work
[1:31:53] tomorrow mhm who's playing whatever
[1:31:57] whatever you've got to do whatever the
[1:31:59] facts it is I and because I can't I I
[1:32:01] don't know where you're thinking but
[1:32:03] unless you're focusing on what I'm
[1:32:05] saying you're somewhere I'd like you to
[1:32:07] say right
[1:32:08] here you're more than a goldfish really
[1:32:11] amen you really they said where where
[1:32:15] Hollywood is doing they have to change a
[1:32:19] scene every five seconds seconds so that
[1:32:23] the children could actually follow along
[1:32:26] in their story every five seconds we use
[1:32:31] well I I've come from the world so I
[1:32:33] know who John Wayne any anybody know who
[1:32:34] John Wayne is you're I'm in Texas aren't
[1:32:38] I John Wayne you ever watch one of their
[1:32:41] movies I mean I mean it must have been
[1:32:43] cheap for them because all you saw all
[1:32:45] day was the guy rid his horse and the
[1:32:48] sheriff's after him riding his horse and
[1:32:51] for half an hour they're riding the
[1:32:53] horse but you were glued to the riding
[1:32:57] the horse but today now they got to keep
[1:32:59] on changing it just like this they keep
[1:33:01] the attention what Satan is trying to do
[1:33:04] is to distract you to know
[1:33:09] God he's trying to alter your thinking
[1:33:16] right I
[1:33:18] just brother Bram said in the message
[1:33:20] and and brother I asked for his book I
[1:33:22] got the quote here I at the last minute
[1:33:24] I I pasted it here but I got it here now
[1:33:27] in book form brother Bram says now he
[1:33:30] says I want to emphasize
[1:33:32] something God the great spirit he's God
[1:33:35] and did you know you were in him if you
[1:33:38] a Christian you was in him then and if
[1:33:42] that be so the whole
[1:33:45] godhead bodily shaped up in the person
[1:33:47] of Jesus Christ you were in him so the
[1:33:51] scripture says the fullness of the
[1:33:53] godhead dwelt bodily in Christ you were
[1:33:58] in him
[1:34:01] then come on Saints I want to help to
[1:34:04] clear up some of the fog of your sinking
[1:34:07] you were with him at Calvary you were
[1:34:10] with him when they beat him you were
[1:34:12] with him in the Tomb but when he rose
[1:34:15] again you were with
[1:34:18] him Hallelujah it wasn't Act of the fact
[1:34:22] it's not a history you were in him if
[1:34:26] you were in him you are always in him
[1:34:28] you were in him before the foundation of
[1:34:30] the
[1:34:31] world
[1:34:33] Hallelujah so in him Saints we have the
[1:34:37] victory we don't have to try and have
[1:34:40] the victory we have the
[1:34:46] victory so we were in
[1:34:49] God and if that be so then the whole
[1:34:53] godhead bodily was shaped Up in Jesus
[1:34:57] Christ and in him for he was the
[1:35:00] fullness of the word
[1:35:04] manifested knowing that he would be
[1:35:07] manifest I'm sorry knowing that he was
[1:35:12] going to
[1:35:13] Calvary he went we we who's a we we went
[1:35:19] in the grave with
[1:35:22] him we raised with
[1:35:26] him and now we've
[1:35:29] ascended that's why he says you're in
[1:35:32] Heavenly places
[1:35:35] always come on stay with me church we
[1:35:38] are in Heavenly places
[1:35:41] always so now what Satan is trying to do
[1:35:44] by his program is to get you out of
[1:35:46] heavenly
[1:35:49] places so then if we we've went to the
[1:35:53] cross with him we went to the Grave with
[1:35:56] him we rose with him we ascended with
[1:36:02] him Heavenly
[1:36:08] places we went in the grave with him we
[1:36:11] raised in the resurrection now we've
[1:36:13] ascended by his Spirit to the throne of
[1:36:18] grace sitting together in Heavenly
[1:36:22] places in Christ
[1:36:25] Jesus for The Germ of Natural Life
[1:36:27] brought was brought is brought down
[1:36:29] germatize from father to father to
[1:36:31] father so is the Life of Christ
[1:36:35] gerti that's the reason God used
[1:36:38] Elijah's Spirit five times what is it
[1:36:42] it's a handing down just as your natural
[1:36:46] life and trait is handed down let this
[1:36:52] mind that was in
[1:36:55] Christ be in
[1:36:58] you
[1:36:59] not
[1:37:01] chat
[1:37:04] GPT huh that is called artificial
[1:37:09] intelligence what is Satan trying to do
[1:37:12] to
[1:37:12] you I I brother Michael gave me a uh an
[1:37:17] example of how it works we would like to
[1:37:19] greet you from Christian Bible Way
[1:37:21] Christian Academy thank you for
[1:37:23] enrolling your student can you give me a
[1:37:25] nice
[1:37:29] letter and that's better than I could
[1:37:31] say
[1:37:32] it that was WR a letter
[1:37:37] huh that's artificial intelligence but
[1:37:40] that's not God's
[1:37:43] intelligence what is he trying to
[1:37:45] do
[1:37:47] parallel
[1:37:49] parallel parallel trying to get you
[1:37:53] distracted from the mind of God so Jesus
[1:37:59] wants you to know that he knows you know
[1:38:04] the
[1:38:06] way God sent you a
[1:38:08] message to show you the
[1:38:14] way knowledge and civilization true
[1:38:17] Christianity has nothing in common did
[1:38:21] you get that we have nothing in
[1:38:24] common civilization true Christianity
[1:38:28] has not one thing in
[1:38:31] common wow we could probably stop there
[1:38:34] and meditate on that one you can either
[1:38:36] get a church in bondage or
[1:38:42] liberated
[1:38:43] civilization is by
[1:38:47] knowledge we all know that knowledge is
[1:38:51] is from
[1:38:55] Eden what he preached in
[1:38:59] Eden knowledge causes
[1:39:04] death is that right what causes death in
[1:39:08] the Garden of Eden
[1:39:10] knowledge but can't be of God so it's of
[1:39:14] the
[1:39:17] devil was that a good one
[1:39:22] H you just thought this was a cool but
[1:39:24] your Prophet said that was a good
[1:39:27] one that was a good one can I read that
[1:39:30] again because it was a good
[1:39:33] one what caused death in the Garden of
[1:39:35] Eden
[1:39:37] knowledge but it can't be of God so it's
[1:39:41] of the
[1:39:42] devil that's a good one knowledge
[1:39:46] Science Education is the greatest
[1:39:50] hindrance that God ever had as your
[1:39:54] pastor was saying brother BR goes on to
[1:39:56] say it's of the devil and what God is
[1:40:00] really trying to do through this word is
[1:40:03] to show you the correct
[1:40:07] way the way is Christ you say well you
[1:40:11] just wrote that message out because of
[1:40:13] Brother David no no no no no no no no
[1:40:15] this mess I already had this message
[1:40:17] before Brother David quoted
[1:40:19] this
[1:40:22] here's an old saying for
[1:40:26] you those of you who think you know
[1:40:28] everything are very annoying to those of
[1:40:32] us who
[1:40:38] do that's a quotable
[1:40:46] quote can I say it again because you
[1:40:49] probably need it three or four times to
[1:40:51] really get the the meaning of that it's
[1:40:53] like one brother said you'll get it
[1:40:56] tomorrow those of you who think you know
[1:40:59] everything are very annoying to those of
[1:41:03] us who
[1:41:08] do so it's not a a new thing it's called
[1:41:13] that was an old
[1:41:17] saying brother Braham said in the
[1:41:20] message what is the works of God not
[1:41:22] knowing the
[1:41:25] Bible you have eternal
[1:41:28] life a lot of people can quote and
[1:41:31] there's there's men that have literally
[1:41:34] memorized the whole Bible but what is
[1:41:37] that done for
[1:41:38] them the letter kth but the spirit gives
[1:41:42] life says you have eternal
[1:41:46] life you've always had eternal
[1:41:53] life but to know
[1:41:56] him is to have eternal life to know him
[1:41:59] you might not know one word of the Bible
[1:42:03] but if you know him in the power of his
[1:42:07] resurrection that is eternal life do you
[1:42:12] know him say yes I know him I know him
[1:42:17] in the power of his resurrection I don't
[1:42:20] know about Jesus I know him as a
[1:42:27] person
[1:42:30] Hallelujah Bible says in Matthew uh St
[1:42:32] Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus
[1:42:35] answered and said I thank the father oh
[1:42:38] Lord of Heaven and Earth thou has hid
[1:42:41] these things from the wise and The
[1:42:44] Prudent and has revealed them unto
[1:42:49] babes that new Believers in the Greek to
[1:42:53] those who are seeking God's Will and
[1:42:57] purpose even so
[1:42:59] father for it seems good in thy sight
[1:43:03] now let me let me give a little
[1:43:05] testimony we have a a a young man that
[1:43:07] just got saved from Thailand in out of
[1:43:10] the mountains of
[1:43:13] Thailand and he was flown over to Canada
[1:43:17] when he was 5 years old went to Ottawa
[1:43:19] with his mom and
[1:43:21] and Dad and ended up now at 20 years old
[1:43:24] in
[1:43:25] Cloverdale witnessed by one of our young
[1:43:28] men I baptized him and before I baptized
[1:43:31] him I'd like to talk to those that I
[1:43:34] take to the Waters of baptism I said
[1:43:36] well when did God start dealing with you
[1:43:38] young
[1:43:39] fella his name is
[1:43:42] lurar when when did when did God start
[1:43:45] dealing with you is the answer Brother
[1:43:47] David
[1:43:49] always he said from a little boy God's
[1:43:53] always dealt with me and I thought right
[1:43:58] answer I said right answer he's like a a
[1:44:02] bright silver dollar wherever he sits in
[1:44:04] the assembly now he's he used to be up
[1:44:06] in the
[1:44:08] balcony but now he's sitting in the
[1:44:10] front row but I think about
[1:44:16] it we've always had the seed of God in
[1:44:22] us and that's why Jesus could say I know
[1:44:26] you
[1:44:30] know I know you know because when you
[1:44:33] walked into this church come on when you
[1:44:37] walked into this little church we're
[1:44:39] just a bunch of rag tag
[1:44:41] people who are we but there's something
[1:44:45] in
[1:44:47] you that desired the God that was in
[1:44:50] somebody
[1:44:52] else and God by his grace and his
[1:44:56] presence awakened that seed within your
[1:45:00] life Peter said to Jesus Thou Art the
[1:45:04] Christ the son of the Living God he said
[1:45:06] blessed art thou Simon bar
[1:45:08] Jonah have a man uh no man taught
[1:45:13] you but my Father in Heaven has revealed
[1:45:15] this to
[1:45:17] you so if you're ever going to know
[1:45:21] God you have to know him by
[1:45:26] Revelation and those that are the seeds
[1:45:28] of God will know him by
[1:45:32] Revelation it's not a carrot on a stick
[1:45:34] that you hope you're going to get if
[1:45:36] you're his seed you will get
[1:45:41] it so Paul could say in second Timothy 1
[1:45:45] and 12 brother John this is what he
[1:45:47] could say for I know
[1:45:51] in whom I have
[1:45:54] believed and am persuaded he's able to
[1:45:57] keep that which I've committed unto him
[1:45:59] against that day I
[1:46:01] know now I
[1:46:04] know has two
[1:46:07] meanings we have
[1:46:10] josco and then you could have epig
[1:46:13] josco or you can have
[1:46:17] IDU epig genosco
[1:46:21] in the know is to
[1:46:24] learn and there's nobody here that can
[1:46:28] learn
[1:46:30] God you can learn a
[1:46:34] trade you can learn to
[1:46:37] sew but you cannot learn
[1:46:41] God but can I say the Ed do
[1:46:44] no is a perfect
[1:46:47] knowledge that is in the
[1:46:52] seed so you didn't learn the
[1:46:56] message the seed in you started to
[1:47:01] awaken to the
[1:47:03] Revelation this message is
[1:47:07] Christ nobody has to teach you that God
[1:47:10] teaches you that it's a knowledge which
[1:47:14] in with which is within and if you look
[1:47:18] it up it's a perfect knowledge
[1:47:22] so he got these people say I got a
[1:47:24] revelation I got a revelation and five
[1:47:26] years later they go that is not a
[1:47:28] perfect knowledge that is an EP that was
[1:47:31] a learning of the
[1:47:33] message you say well they were good
[1:47:36] believers they learned how to dress
[1:47:39] right they learned how to talk
[1:47:42] right they learned how to amen
[1:47:46] hallelujah we are one in the spirit
[1:47:50] huh they learned all that but those that
[1:47:54] are the seing of God we didn't learn it
[1:47:58] it was from
[1:48:00] within that's my Jesus that's my
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:06] eag
[1:48:10] Hallelujah but because you're living in
[1:48:13] an age of
[1:48:16] knowledge they said every 20 it used to
[1:48:18] be brother Rond talked about the horse
[1:48:20] and buggy horse and buggy to car car to
[1:48:23] Jet Jet to
[1:48:25] astronaut and Jim you would know that
[1:48:27] because
[1:48:29] you're in the airplane business they're
[1:48:32] always
[1:48:33] upgrading I don't want a
[1:48:36] DC3 why would I want a
[1:48:40] DC3 bunch of propellers no I want the
[1:48:43] Jet and now they got quieter Jets what
[1:48:46] what what are those things called what
[1:48:48] do they call those jet
[1:48:51] housings anyways whatever they are I
[1:48:54] hate it when my seat is right at that
[1:48:57] window you got to have those noise
[1:48:59] cancelling and but now it's getting
[1:49:02] better and better now they made an
[1:49:05] announcement this morning there's a new
[1:49:07] Wing
[1:49:08] design for
[1:49:11] better uh for the
[1:49:14] green what
[1:49:16] green last time I looked around here
[1:49:19] there's not even grass
[1:49:22] around this world's in a birth
[1:49:25] pain because of
[1:49:31] knowledge Satan can only be a
[1:49:35] destroyer that's why all creation
[1:49:38] Gress waiting for the manifestation of
[1:49:42] the sons of
[1:49:44] God letting us brother when she knows
[1:49:47] who she
[1:49:48] is then we will be raptured so now you
[1:49:53] want to know the way he's the way the
[1:49:55] word's the way this message is the way
[1:49:59] we get so much
[1:50:03] distractions and that's what we want to
[1:50:06] be dealing with not only as a person
[1:50:09] individual as a church as a body as
[1:50:16] Believers for I
[1:50:19] know in whom I have
[1:50:22] believed I'm persuaded He's
[1:50:25] Able there was a note written by a
[1:50:27] little old sister Who Loved this
[1:50:30] scripture I just read to
[1:50:33] you she was confined to a bed in a
[1:50:36] nursing
[1:50:37] home and the visitors would come to
[1:50:40] visit her and over the passing of time
[1:50:43] she said I I know in whom I have
[1:50:47] believed what I've committed to him but
[1:50:50] growing
[1:50:51] weaker the next time they visit they
[1:50:53] said what I have committed to him she
[1:50:57] was growing weaker and her voice became
[1:51:00] faint and she whispered in her lips
[1:51:05] him
[1:51:07] him him that was all that was left in
[1:51:11] her is
[1:51:15] him
[1:51:17] Christ him he was everything to her Nam
[1:51:24] one and seven don't don't need to turn
[1:51:26] the Lord is good he's strong he's a
[1:51:31] stronghold in the day of trouble and he
[1:51:34] knoweth them that trust in him so not
[1:51:39] only do we know who he
[1:51:42] is God knows who you
[1:51:48] are
[1:51:50] that's why we David cried out the Lord
[1:51:53] is the portion of my
[1:51:55] inheritance and of my cup thou maintain
[1:52:00] us my lot thy lines have fallen unto me
[1:52:03] in Pleasant places I have a god goodly
[1:52:07] Heritage the Amplified said the Lord is
[1:52:09] my is my chosen my assigned portion my
[1:52:13] cup and you hold and maintain my lot it
[1:52:18] isn't new holding on to to God it's God
[1:52:22] holding on to
[1:52:33] you Daniel 12 and four but thou oh
[1:52:38] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:52:40] book even to the time of the end many
[1:52:43] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:52:46] increase how many have used this
[1:52:47] scripture said in the last days
[1:52:50] knowledge shall increase everybody I I'm
[1:52:52] just wondering you know I mean don't be
[1:52:53] ashamed I mean it's scripture surely
[1:52:55] you've read the scripture want to put it
[1:52:58] out hand yeah you've read that scripture
[1:53:00] okay that's good not if you haven't now
[1:53:02] you
[1:53:04] have so now what what does Daniel
[1:53:06] actually say what is the Hebrew of this
[1:53:09] I want you to take a look at so we know
[1:53:11] that knowledge will
[1:53:13] increase do you think God's interested
[1:53:16] in Satan's
[1:53:17] knowledge no you you knowledge would
[1:53:20] increase AI is going to take over
[1:53:22] Humanity which it
[1:53:25] will knowledge will you think God's
[1:53:27] really interested in Satan's knowledge
[1:53:29] no I thank you for saying that because
[1:53:33] he's not for in the Hebrew it says
[1:53:37] now ask for you Daniel conceal these
[1:53:41] words seal it up the scroll to the end
[1:53:45] many will go back and forth search
[1:53:48] anxiously through this through the
[1:53:50] scroll or through the books and
[1:53:53] knowledge now I want you to take a word
[1:53:55] look a word at that word knowledge that
[1:53:57] word knowledge is the purpose of God as
[1:54:01] revealed by His
[1:54:05] prophets knowledge would increase in the
[1:54:08] last
[1:54:09] day so then if knowledge is not the
[1:54:13] knowledge of Satan's Eden but the
[1:54:16] knowledge of God in this last days would
[1:54:18] increase then the purpose of God will be
[1:54:23] now
[1:54:24] revealed by his
[1:54:27] prophet and we will greatly
[1:54:31] increase it's already been prophesied
[1:54:34] amen you've already been prophesied that
[1:54:37] you are going to greatly increase in the
[1:54:40] purpose of God and what is the purpose
[1:54:43] of God brother R said that's a
[1:54:46] three-fold purpose Christ of mystery God
[1:54:48] revealed is what to restore Eden to
[1:54:52] restore Adam and to restore
[1:54:55] Eve so now this purpose of God will be
[1:55:01] greatly
[1:55:02] increased when brother Tom when the
[1:55:06] scroll is
[1:55:09] open you wouldn't have a clue Cosman you
[1:55:13] wouldn't have a clue apparently you were
[1:55:16] overseas what Would You Preach without
[1:55:18] this message I want ask you what would
[1:55:20] you preach they say we got the Bible
[1:55:23] yeah the Catholic church has the Bible
[1:55:26] the Baptists have the Bible the
[1:55:29] Pentecostals have the Bible but they
[1:55:31] don't know what it is but in this day
[1:55:34] under Daniel's prophecy this knowledge
[1:55:38] would increase for your
[1:55:42] purpose this Christ this word has
[1:55:45] unveiled to bring you to be like him
[1:55:50] Amen to be like Jesus you sing you sing
[1:55:54] to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be
[1:55:57] like
[1:55:58] him the only way to get there there only
[1:56:01] one way I'll show you the way I am the
[1:56:07] way still with me yes many shall run to
[1:56:11] and fro anxiously looking wondering
[1:56:15] Looking Through the Bible wondering what
[1:56:17] does it mean what does it actually say
[1:56:21] how many of us before we came into this
[1:56:23] word looked at the Bible wondered what
[1:56:27] Jesus said go ye all the world baptize
[1:56:31] them in the name of the father of the
[1:56:34] Son and the Holy Ghost how many were
[1:56:38] baptized in a trinity Doctrine but then
[1:56:41] a message came the book was open the
[1:56:43] scroll is revealed huh and we found out
[1:56:47] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:56:50] father Son and Holy Ghost we don't
[1:56:52] believe in a Triune God he's one God one
[1:56:56] Lord one
[1:56:58] baptism
[1:57:00] Hallelujah God of this evil
[1:57:03] age we know Satan's gospel is a gospel
[1:57:08] of
[1:57:09] Science and
[1:57:13] progress did you know they say
[1:57:16] 97% of all jobs
[1:57:20] will be lost through
[1:57:24] AI I guess everybody's still going to be
[1:57:26] on
[1:57:31] government didn't didn't everybody get
[1:57:33] that when you're were in
[1:57:35] Co they couldn't get everybody back to
[1:57:37] work because they made more through the
[1:57:39] government handout than they did their
[1:57:44] job Satan knows how to destroy an
[1:57:47] economy and that is a great word if you
[1:57:50] want to take a look at it one day God
[1:57:53] has an economy also brother Bram said
[1:57:56] and in God's economy he's not interested
[1:57:58] in silver and gold because Peter said I
[1:58:01] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:58:03] I have I give you thee in the name of
[1:58:06] Jesus Christ rise up and behold what
[1:58:10] God's economy is is God wants to give
[1:58:13] you
[1:58:14] himself so that you could be like he is
[1:58:18] that is your inheritance he maintaines
[1:58:21] my Lord his lines have fallen on
[1:58:24] Pleasant places she is him Hallelujah
[1:58:29] come on people she is him you are him
[1:58:33] your pastor said the other day we got to
[1:58:35] grow up we got to grow up brother Bram
[1:58:38] said in white Christ speak you got to
[1:58:40] stop being
[1:58:42] babies come on stop being babies do I

[1:58:55] Moses amen it's not you that's going to
[1:58:57] take you out of the trial it's the god
[1:59:00] in you that's going to get you out of
[1:59:02] the trial and there should be a little
[1:59:04] bit more expression because when
[1:59:07] Miriam Moses was
[1:59:10] 80 so let's just say she was
[1:59:14] 10 when they were floating him down the
[1:59:16] river and mama says go follow the B B

[1:59:22] have drowned so let's say she was
[1:59:25] walking along the Nile let's give her 10
[1:59:27] so Moses is
[1:59:29] 80 Miriam's
[1:59:31] 90 and when when pharaoh and his
[1:59:35] armies were
[1:59:39] destroyed come
[1:59:41] on when that that
[1:59:45] trial come on was opened up and Israel
[1:59:49] walked through the
[1:59:51] trial but once through the trial the
[1:59:54] enemy thought he could go through the
[1:59:55] same way no sir come
[1:59:58] on no sir he cannot come through the
[2:00:02] blood Hallelujah and once he went
[2:00:04] through that Red Sea God just rained
[2:00:07] down the waters and there was Miriam
[2:00:10] with a
[2:00:12] tambourine your
[2:00:14] enemy your enemy that has bothered you

[2:23:49] wife that needs prayer I said the Pastor
[2:23:52] said no prayer no prayer so he comes to
[2:23:54] the pulpit he said the reason why we
[2:23:56] didn't pray this morning he said because
[2:23:59] the Bible talks about that God will
[2:24:01] confirm his word with signs
[2:24:05] following Joan was playing at the orgon
[2:24:08] people came up people left we were the

[2:54:40] amen that spoke to my heart this morning
[2:54:45] [Music]
[2:54:48] you know I thought of
[2:54:52] Peter as brother Tom spoke and I thought
[2:54:56] Lord what are you trying to tell our
[2:54:57] church
[2:54:59] and let me put it this way to you as
[2:55:01] simply as I can it's time to get rid of
[2:55:04] the
[2:55:07] self-doubt amen amen it's time to get
[2:55:10] rid of the
[2:55:13] excuses you are who he said you
[2:55:16] are Hallelujah not what the critics say
[2:55:19] you are not what the devil says you are
[2:55:24] not all the things he tries to hinder
[2:55:26] you with you are what he said you
[2:55:30] are and he said you are my
[2:55:33] bride and it's time to get rid of the
[2:55:38] self-doubt it's time to claim your
[2:55:41] place and do what you're called to do
[2:55:45] do Peter after denying the Lord three
[2:55:49] times
[2:55:53] sure what a weight would that be to
[2:55:58] overcome but that same Peter walked up
[2:56:01] to the gate called
[2:56:03] beautiful and he looked at a man yeah
[2:56:06] and he said
[2:56:07] Silver and
[2:56:10] Gold Have I None right
[2:56:15] and this is what I believe that the Lord
[2:56:17] wants this church and this body to be
[2:56:21] able to say but that which I
[2:56:26] have yes sir I give unto
[2:56:32] you Peter personally
[2:56:36] claimed the possession in life yes of
[2:56:40] Jesus Christ in him and he didn't doubt
[2:56:44] [Music]
[2:56:48] it that which I have I I
[2:56:53] give and Jesus said it's been freely
[2:56:57] given yes freely
[2:57:02] give you can't doubt that who you are
[2:57:05] you can't doubt what the word of God
[2:57:08] [Music]
[2:57:09] says you can't now be made perfect by
[2:57:13] the law
[2:57:15] when you receive the Spirit by faith of
[2:57:19] hearing the word of
[2:57:21] God so it's just time so I'm a wreck
[2:57:25] yeah I am I got complexes I got problems
[2:57:28] I got all that but you know he chose
[2:57:31] that
[2:57:32] wreck and he put his spirit in that
[2:57:36] wreck Hallelujah and he said I'll will
[2:57:38] hear this W's prayer yeah if this wreck
[2:57:41] lays his hands on the sick they will
[2:57:44] recover with all his faults all his
[2:57:46] negativities I'm going to be with him
[2:57:49] even in him to the end it didn't
[2:57:52] determine on what I was it's what he
[2:57:55] was it wasn't by what I thought it's by
[2:57:59] what he
[2:58:00] said that's right and it's by faith
[2:58:04] yes by
[2:58:07] Revelation he called
[2:58:09] me he opened my eyes to see it I believe
[2:58:14] it and God's
[2:58:17] word will
[2:58:19] do what he said he would
[2:58:22] do and if he said that he put that life
[2:58:25] in me yes and the works that he did I'll
[2:58:29] do also I don't do it by righteousness I
[2:58:33] do it by his word he said if I Lay My
[2:58:36] Hands on the sick that will recover then
[2:58:39] I know if I Lay My Hands on the sick
[2:58:43] they recover why because of the law of
[2:58:45] my righteousness no because of the faith
[2:58:49] in his
[2:58:50] word hallelujah and what's he telling us
