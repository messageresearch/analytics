needs be you put in a new heart or a new spirit or a new attitude just do whatever needs to happen great physician and lord i know you're working on all of us differently differently but if it's not for us let us pull for somebody else just do a work among us jesus take your word now and let it hit the mark in jesus name amen hallelujah i'm gonna let you have your seats for a moment if that's okay we want to remember brother david mcgary his mother is turning 99 years old this week so he went away with his wife leslie and is there and we support that amen we we're glad for him and his mother and family brother billy is just getting ready to speak and the second service in missouri him and brother andrew are there together and brother matthew mcgarry is at brother jason jackson's in arkansas and so as we said this morning brother john's here i'm the spare tire and one of the brothers today said he said you know what he that's what the greatest fear about a spare tire is when you need it you hope it's not flat especially if you're out in the middle of the desert somewhere and you got a flat tire you open it up and get the you haven't used that thing you dust off the you know the cobwebs and it's flat so that's not what i brought you here for to be flat you know so you're gonna have to help us tonight amen so i'm the associate of the associate of the associate of the associate i'm way down the line somewhere i'm the pinch hitter in the ninth inning amen hallelujah we were here in dallas on may 14 15 and 16. and you might remember we were talking about um the disciples before calvary and um do you all remember we said just give them 50 days give them 60 days y'all remember that because you know peter's cursing he's swearing and all kinds of people's running in the garden when jesus needed them the most they didn't have the holy ghost pentecost is 50. so do you all remember i said let's give them 50 days and so well we've gone 70 days since that weekend how you all doing how y'all doing i mean sister julie remember that that we in may had said well just give them 50 days so this is the 70th day there's 20 more days how y'all doing do i need to give a microphone do you ever how you all doing well god bless you tonight so i trust the spare tire's not flat tonight i heard a testimony of our sister that was saved when she was 81 years old is that incredible can you stand can you stand sister yeah you can you just stan are you going to wait let's give it a round of applause that's incredible amen most people brother sister seiler are give their heart to the lord before they're 18. that's what brother branham said children young people and to know that god can deal with someone that's 81 years old and she's almost 84. i don't mean to give your age out but her husband's 84. isn't it good to have people around us that love the lord jesus and whether they're young old who sang the song tonight with you sister lori was that zoe zoe and that was wonderful god bless you sister zoe you know we went to a restaurant today and i asked her i said what should i get what's good here and she talk and she got something and i got exactly what she got i said good job zoe you know sometimes we need to talk to our young people hallelujah so if i collapse tonight zoe [Laughter] you're gonna have to stand and sing amen i'll give one more testimony there was a brother where i was with this afternoon too and and just as i was getting into the car he gave me a testimony of a lady he was close to that was born with a hole in her heart and they didn't know that until age four i believe they found it they found the hole in her heart and they stitched it up and it wasn't until her 50s i believe it was i'm just trying to relate it as we were standing at the door it wasn't until she was in her 50s that it almost killed her because they found that the scars that had been on her heart was causing her trouble and they had to go in and do another heart surgery and they put in a pacemaker i believe a heart defibrillator i believe and her heart is now connected to her cell phone which is then connected to the doctor and the doctor the hospital and every so often they have to do checkups and updates and tune-ups and and the man said um about this lady that she can feel that she can feel that in her heart and i was thinking spiritually because that's what we spoke on this morning and tonight lord if you have to take out our heart and do some work on it tonight you might feel it but it's for your good and so you might have been born with an issue maybe they didn't find it until later and then maybe there are scars in your heart maybe there's things issues and matters a situations and even if as you get older it has to be dealt with again it's okay god's got everything under control so let's stand and turn to ezekiel tonight um ezekiel chapter 11 thank you musicians and i don't mean to take so much of your time we love you and you must love us it's a hundred degrees today i'm glad we have air conditioning i mean who's glad we have air conditioning about half of you well the other half must be turning to the scripture amen because i'm glad we have air conditioning hallelujah if we didn't have that probably half of us would already been i don't know where we'd be probably on the floor brother jackson amen thank you jesus we're spoiled a little bit ain't me we we can hear the word and comfort and to know that god's talking to us on a deeper level than just what you see on the outside we've never really met the real you we just see the outside the real you is down on the inside and so tonight let's deal with some of that again i trust it'll be a blessing lord take our hearts now and take your word and write upon our hearts what we need lord i cannot speak things tonight that would meet every person's need but you can so talk to us personally like we were all alone in a little booth talk to us in jesus name ezekiel 11 17. i see we're training someone there in the computer no he's the man okay all right ezekiel chapter 11 tonight we're speaking on healing for spiritual heart trouble ezekiel 11 17 therefore say thus saith the lord god watch notice who's speaking i will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from fence verse 19. god speaking and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you hallelujah and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh so what do you got to do tonight just let him have his way isn't that so hard right sister liz isn't that hard we want to do things we want to make no we need to put you to sleep and we need to let the lord just come you're laying on the operating room and let the great physician give you a new heart give you a new spirit and that'd be wonderful and take out of you that old stoniness let's just go to ezekiel 18 verse 31 i wish i knew all of your names well maybe you you're glad i don't know your names but you know it's different when someone says your name amen ezekiel 18 31 cast away from you all your transgressions that's good encouragement cast away from you ezekiel 18 31 cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die o house of israel i could speak this is to the jews but we could speak to believers amongst the message or the bride why will you die or to christian life tabernacle uh casting away all your transgressions and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die christian life tabernacle is there no bomb in dallas is there no physician there then why are we sick why do we have heart trouble when the very one that made our hearts is here to give us a new heart he gave you a natural heart he can give you a spiritual heart okay our last scripture is ezekiel 36 before you're seated if you can stand lord translate this tonight into the spanish and the french and the language of the heart that's the main thing it's not english no the heavenly language isn't english it's the language of the heart it's when god talks to the heart hallelujah that's the language of believe me friends when we get to heaven i don't really care if we speak french german russian ukrainian chinese i don't really care i just want to be there anybody else with me i mean well i think it's going to be this and well whatever it's going to be i want to be there you know hallelujah ezekiel 36 24. again notice who's speaking for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness well i thought it was just those certain things or those some things the bible doesn't say some of your filthiness it says all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you so it's not the church or the preacher or the pope it's not the nurse or the doctor god's cleansing us he sent his word and healed them okay now vote notice verse 26 our last two verses here a new heart let's all say a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh well that'd be wonderful wouldn't it to be in a church where people had new hearts new spirits stoniness was leaving grudges was leaving bad talking nasty lying was leaving and god was giving us his heart his spirit now verse 26 is a new heart will i give you in a new spirit but we have to have verse 27 this is justification sanctification now god's spirit i will put my spirit within you when he talked about in verse 26 if you want to put it back to 26 when it says a new spirit will i give you brother branham said he gave you a new spirit to put up with your own to put up i mean how can you even deal with one another without the right spirit but you still got to go further verse 27 is the going further i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them it's thus saith the lord god bless you can have your seats and i think there's room in the sanctuary for anyone that might be in the overflow and want to come on in amen we got some room tonight praise god back in may we were all packed out and full and out in the cars and everything and now you can breathe a little bit hallelujah breathe a little bit it's just the home folks just the home folks tonight healing for spiritual heart trouble now tonight we're going to focus on healing if that's okay god heals i mentioned this this morning but in 1963 in in arkansas brother branham said god heals in many ways a doctor asked me not long ago what's your opinion of medicine brother branham i said well god is the only one that can heal sir i said the bible don't lie and the bible said i am the lord that heals all your diseases and the bible can't lie god heals he goes immediately and said god heals by medicine god heals by love god heals by understanding god heals by care god heals by prayer god heals by miracles the whole thing he said god heals that's all there is he is the healer medicine can't create can't create a cells in your hand and in your body to heal we can move a tooth we can cut out an appendix or take out a gallbladder but who heals who heals tonight let's have a little bit of back and forth here who heals see medicine can't build tissue only god can do that life builds tissue god is the only healer and he said and we were talking on that so we were talking on that this morning i'm talking on it tonight about god healing but we're going to some spiritual heart troubles because when brother branham was speaking about god heals and i know all of you believe that but he talked about god heals by medicine god healing by love healing by prayer and by miracles and by said understanding but he said god heals by care now that might not mean very much to you until you get in a situation and you don't feel care you don't kill feel cared for it just seems like we're so busy today we don't have time to give uh people attention amen but do you know god cares and he heals by care that so struck me and it struck brother branham that three weeks later he left arkansas and went back to jeffersonville and preached a whole message on he cares do you now i want to show you tonight how god heals it's it's not always in the same way i'm trying to nice to have you back brother cosman amen and amen are in the back hallelujah you missed this morning so make up for it tonight amen i got you you know when brother branham was dealing with the conditions of the heart he had a lot of divine healing services is that right divine healing services there was a lot of laying on of hands and the very gift that god used of him taking the person by the hand and knowing the secrets of the heart was to bring the person to healing it wasn't a show-off and the very thing of brother branham knowing a person's name and you had and you're an address back there and what you were doing this afternoon you know at 3 38 god knows all about that and you say wow 338 where was oh god knew he knows me that was a gift that was operating to bring the people to know that god cares for you cares enough about your need to say your name and what you were going through this afternoon or yesterday to get you to a healing not for us to say oh brother branham brother branham brother branham brother branham we're not branhamites we're sons and daughters of god is that okay i hope i didn't embarrass or offend anyone there the whole thing about prayer lines and put your need on a card and things and coming before brother branham time after time after time an anointing with oil and i see oil is up here tonight and we anoint with oil and laying hands on the sick that is for a person to be healed but the virtue isn't in the oil it's in your faith in god god heals so now brother branham is under the impact of this god cares god heals by caring and by understanding and by love and it wasn't just like a passing filler thought he comes back to jeffersonville and preaches he cares to you care and said i hope that each one of you get that especially you people that's to be prayed for that's so uncomfortable this morning with maybe troubles that doctors cannot touch say anyone with no need of a physician can just wave at the doctor how you doing all's good good all's good but if you're sitting there uncomfortable and you have trouble and you have a need that's when you want to flag down a doctor 9-1-1 call the doctor do you we've got to deal with this issue then you know it's so um evident when it's a need on the outside broken leg flipped over car you know a gash in the head it's so obvious you're not walking right but when it's a heart trouble you could actually be as we said this morning 99 with a blockage and not even know it are we all together you could have a spiritual issue going on and it's so well hidden that's why the gifts of god has got to go a lot deeper than emotion a whole lot deeper than storytelling and fantastics and 20-minute sermons tell the people how good they are thank you for your tithes and offerings we'll see you next sunday it's got to go deeper than that if not we become another church and another denomination and people get older in the message and get spiritual dementia spiritual alzheimer's where they are literally losing their mind they have lost their way they don't know how to think they don't know how to make decisions they don't know how to walk in life they don't know how to have leadership and pretty soon it gets to a place where the holy spirit is no longer the leader of the church no more it's politics it's friendships it's feelings we just become a clique and a cliche and well that's where we go to church brother john and man's ideas we share if we agree we rejoice we say man if not then we kind of get a little like this and people do what they want to do people live how they want to be that's the church but the bride lives different than that hallelujah i believe the lord is interested in your life when he puts his finger on the need and he puts his finger on the real problem and starts talking about the trouble people don't want to admit they have trouble today people want to put up a front and make it looks like you know we got it all together as mommy daddy brother sister and we're just all walking like ducklings across the road and things and they just want to put up this all's good and then things grow up and people grow up and things begin to change and they begin to realize there's deep needs there's trouble and it turns into chaos and it turns into breakages and breakings uh of homes and breakings of churches and i'll get into that a little bit later it's a lack of love the reason why people have such lack of desperation today is a lack of love i've seen it over the last 16 months in the message this whole pandemic satan has achieved a lot of what was in his mind by causing a serious diversion people's attention on the numbers and get their attention on the news and you know what's the cases and what's the you wear a mask or you got a distance you got a channel and they get their mind to people's minds all stirred up before pretty soon you look back over what's happened in your life and you realize you're looking more at the news than you are the word of god you're more concerned about your health than you are your spiritual health and the whole focus shifts do you know what's happened the devil has achieved his plan and it's not a local issue what brother john dealt with this morning and tonight is not a glo it's not a local issue it's a global issue serious heart trouble spiritual amnesia has struck and a person can be going along on the train and be a soldier and you know go through the motions and be totally out of their place i pray that god would show us that that place in the word and show us our place in christ and it might shake you just a little bit i got to say some things people don't want to admit when they got trouble well i'm not going to go to the doctor and i'm not going to go to the nurse and i'm not going to take this pill god heals god heals and i'm not gonna take no medicine and i'm not gonna take this and that and if we're not careful we're actually going against what a prophet taught god heals by medicine so brother branham comes back to jeffersonville's home church where he felt comfortable and start speaking about people that were in the service that were uncomfortable and had troubles that doctors cannot touch and he says we believe doctors help people he said i believe that god heals by medicine god heals by surgery god heals by understanding this is another service god heals by love just a little love goes a long way he said let somebody be all upset and just show them that you care for them god heals by love you know i experienced that this last week you know you can be in a situation approaching something you really don't know what to do about it just have a little patience be sensitive make yourself available just in the back part of your heart say be praying about this and then all of a sudden god gives you a little door he gives you a little window and you say something show some care learn to listen hallelujah people don't really care what you know until they know how much you care and sometimes that takes some time and working on relationships a little bit is that okay i mean what brother john's talking about is actually very deep tonight you know your relationships that you have in your life is actually reflecting your personal revelation and your experience with god and you want to know the condition of a church many times the women in a church or the ladies reflect the teachings of a church and many times young people in a church reflect the revelation of their parents and of that church we can make great accolades and say a lot of things and have charts and powerpoints but our revelation is coming through our our assembly and we don't want there to be hidden heart trouble when god knows all about it and it's not being dealt with properly praise god you know people they hear these things and they just want to defend themselves they want to give an excuse about why it is the way it is they want to cast stones at someone else they don't want to take responsibility they don't want to take accountability they must want to keep propping up something of the past and divert attention and manipulate away but the holy spirit is dealing with something people will deny you they can hear the truth and know it's something they ought to do and they'll look right at you and deny and they'll shake their head they dismiss it and they give a reason they don't want to accept that they have a problem i had that in my notes to say to you tonight god i don't want to be like that we're dealing with a heart situation with a heart issue and how many believe a prophet when he said god heals by love he heals by understanding and by care just show them how much you care for them god heals by prayer by miracles god heals by his word god heals i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases so it should work together and men in different ministries should work together for that you know friends that's why all the gifts in the ministry are different but rather than glomming onto one and saying oh the prophet one is the or the pr pastor or the evangelist and i gotta favorite this or i just like to hear this sister sing or that brother this rather than glomming on to the natural why don't you just step back and thank the lord because it's the holy spirit flowing through the body he's using these different gifts to get your heart to believe and to be healed the moment you go try to dissect everything and understand everything you just ended and hit a brick wall you'll never understand everything you get all nervous and upset and troubled i want to say tonight god cares for you now who enjoyed the binoculars somebody took them away from up here amen brother david you took them home didn't you you got them well that's okay i think people remember binoculars y'all remember that seeing the antelope and our brother was up here he was so skilled i found out later he knew how to use binoculars amen it was all fuzzy and everything trying to read that sign back there brother i'm talking to brother cosman because you all know what i'm talking about but brother cosman we had binoculars here this morning and somebody was back there and we couldn't read it because it was all fuzzy but the binoculars were focused in and we begin to realize that we need to have our binoculars focused in or we say well there's three antelope or four antelope no there's only one do we all got that well brother john didn't finish the quote tonight this morning so i'm going to lead you up to something while i was speaking about binoculars because it came to a situation in victory day brother branham was talking about this about god's binoculars and now is everybody listening i gotta say three things before we close tonight i gotta get to some things there was a young lady in victory day he's talking about this young lady that was in the service and he had had an interview with her she was a minister's daughter and she had had some kind of a love affair and she had lost her mind about it and she's gone she had a breakdown and a very beautiful young woman about 23 years old so now we have a 23 year old beautiful young lady a minister's daughter brother branham had went back into her life and when she was a little girl of about 12 years old she was in a mother meeting of brother branham's up at illinois listen a 12 year old girl and brother branham said the holy spirit went through the audience and called her who she was and said you've got a murmuring heart we're speaking on heart trouble and healing and here's a 12 year old girl that had a murmuring heart and the doctor said you can't live until you're 15 years old that's three years but thus saith the lord you're healed so here now a 12 year old girl it would be like brother jackson and zoe and the doctor saying we found this murmuring heart she can't live until another three years of her life we would have got serious and a prayer request and brought her to a meeting and to have the holy spirit go out and call her name and say thus saith the lord you're healed and brother branham said she never never even felt a heart trouble since praise the lord god heals that was when she was 12. now she's 23 years old and brother madam said last night she had a different type of heart trouble it was a spiritual heart trouble and that's where brother john got this title for tonight spiritual heart trouble so now she was healed of a murmuring heart when she was young now she has a spiritual heart trouble her lover had run off and married some other woman yet she was still in love i want you to notice this she was still in love and this boy kept telling her that he was in love yet with her and then he said well your father caused all of this and brother branham said that's nonsense he didn't have to go marry this other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you right so now she's a young lady in the church a beautiful young lady but she has literally lost her mind and brother brennam said she was all wound up into that the girl sat there in such a stoop like and said oh i know johnny loves me i know said that's all she could see she lived in that one little world by herself she had formed herself in there she's looking through the binoculars saying i love this gu johnny and he loves me and we're gonna be happily ever and whatever and it's uh causing trouble and he goes marries another girl and trying to blame it on the father and give all kinds of excuses he's left he's gone she's still in love and she has made herself a whole world she's living in and brother branham said that's all she could see she lived in that one little world by herself she had formed herself in there now isn't that amazing she was living in a world that wasn't even real she had formed herself in there i wonder how many times that happens among us people are actually living in another world is that have you noticed that and it's like wow this person it's like they've lost their mind and so brother bradham was very discerning and he just now this isn't inappropriate because her mother and father was there he took her by the hand like this and said listen to me and now here the lord showed him a vision you see she knowed that i know nothing about something had taken place some transaction between them now brother john's not here to tell you what that was but we already know that she was in a love affair so i'm just going to let the lord just let that go but there were things that had happened between a girl and a boy if you understand what i mean and brother branham goes in a vision and sees that and when i said that that snapped her right quick see nobody could touch that nobody knew that that had happened but the girl and the guy and now brother branham brother branham says that and it snaps her i said while you're out of there where do you come from i came from a world i had formed and it was literally driving her crazy brother branham speaks a word that no one knew but the boy and the girl the boy's gone the girls living in her world but the truth is spoken and she's brought out of that and brother branham says while you're out of there look to calvary that's why i'm saying tonight god heals god cares don't ever anybody in this building or on the internet ever say nobody cares nobody knows god knows god cares and if no one in the world cares to know that god cares i don't need my family my friends in a stadium full of 50 000 people cheering my name tonight to know that jesus knows jesus cares or to just say praise be to god but if you're not careful you'll build yourself a complex and start living in a world and it's not even real we need the word to come and burst that bubble and snap you out of that and say look to christ here's some binoculars here's a weekend of services here does a special meeting here you can visit from florida or visit from wherever you can click onto the internet and say why is he saying that and god's talking to you right now snap out of that world you're living in i can't brother john i can't that's why the word is coming like this to break the yoke the anointing breaks every yoke for what reason to bring healing to bring deliverance you don't need to have spiritual heart trouble i don't believe the bride is in a lot of confusion tonight we just read it out of ezekiel i will give you a new heart i will give you a new spirit and i will put my spirit on you so you don't need to be anxious over nothing are we all together now the lord showed him something he called it a transaction between them and it snapped her out then he said while you're out here look to calvary there you're gonna you're going out here and trying to started to drink a minister's daughter pentecostal minister's daughter doing the things that you're doing trying to drown that sorrow that man that somebody that don't care the snap of their finger for you i said look yonder to calvary girl that's the only way back paragraph 62 he said we've got to get ourselves focused till whether we live or die sink or drown it's calvary it's christ that's the thing that god wants us to come back to men in the focus of god's word instead of bringing it together and making it say the one thing that god says we look at the natural side hallelujah god break us out of the natural side some of you already fixing your job and fixing tomorrow you're already at school or at work or going on a bus or something we need to snap out of that and realize the great physician now is near you're in an operating room you're wanting to be drive through mcdonald's and starbucks and why is it taking so long god doesn't work like that god's not a fast food god he's not a fast food religion christian life tabernacle and a drive-through church you drive through order your big mac and you're a little chit and i'm gonna go and if i don't get my fries i'm gonna tell you man yeah man you bad attitude you'll miss the rapture like that [Music] man didn't make man drink the way i said double not take vanilla well you had so many things you you've got so stuck and you're right i want a vanilla latte half sweet dance and that and it's got to be this and extra hot and all of that and they didn't double the cup and you're so spoiled rotten why don't you drink water today [Music] i don't know what it is but y'all bring out the worst in me i come to dallas and start saying things my wife's probably shaking her head right now cause that's exactly what happens when i go through the drive-through with my wife and she's saying all this double this dumb americano this and that and heavy stubby cream and like wow and it's hardly ever right and i'm always thinking in my mind why don't you just be simple but she's my help mate and she's my better half that straightens me out so i just i'll just have a nice water please then they don't put ice in it that brisket sandwich is always working on me right now and then people go through things and they lose brotherly love and they don't have love for one another or understanding i'm still quoting understanding one another they don't love one and they worship with one they degrade a man because of the clothes he wears or the education or the color of his skin well that's not politically correct is it but brother branham said it start talking about this and that and the other and it separates people and man takes off after that paragraph 64. it never gives the inward man a chance to operate we're a triune being soul spirit and body he's talking about the natural mind and how the two spiritual forces that work in you and your mind and your spirit and he starts talking about the natural mind that's highly polished and things like that later in that paragraph i know you're trying to keep up with me but brother branham's talking about a person that throws themselves away from the spiritual man that's in you and there is what causes the trouble right there he tries to make it out in himself praise god is there any spiritual heart conditions in dallas conditions spiritual is not just natural it's not dealing with many times the soul and spirit the natural things i'm talking about when you talk about heart disease heart trouble but then there's a spiritual part that is going beyond the outside and what we can get ourselves in situations conditions heart conditions my we can get ourselves in situations i'm thankful for the scripture we read this morning that he's beautiful in situation how many years ever thought that lord what do you do with people like me i guess you all are angels hey anybody here ever said lord what do you do with people like me you know i knew better i've heard the you know and then we get in a place does that mean you're not a son of god you're not a no god just deals with us all differently we're all made up different but when we get in a condition it means that there's something out of order it's disorder it's a ailment or an illness you've come into a state and it's because of the situation you're in tonight i want to throw you a lifeline and say give you an announcement there is help for you tonight there is a healing agent or a bomb that can deal with that situation that can help in the time of need there is a bomb b-a-l-m healing in your city of dallas texas the great physician is very very near he's he's near right now i know some of you are tired and a little warm but the great physician isn't here i mean sometimes brother branham would be stalling stalling stalling and he would say you wonder why i'm waiting i'm waiting for him hello i'm waiting for him he's here now some of you may wonder how jesus died do you know that he died of a broken heart brother bottom talked about this and how it was not the roman spear that he died neither was it the loss of blood that he died because there was still blood in his body he said this in jeffersonville but he died what he died of was not the roman spear the nails that was drove in his hand or the thorny crown they placed on his head but because he died of grief he died of a broken heart do you all really believe that this is brother bradham saying jesus died of a broken heart and later in the paragraph 31 he said he died of a broken heart so much grief i'm saying these things for a reason who prayed tonight this brother prayed right here i appreciated that prayer brother that was wonderful i was sitting back there listening looking up that's incredible he's praying like that that really touched me jesus died of a broken heart that means it can really happen and if he died of a broken heart it can affect you and me do you all know that it's actually a physical ailment broken heart syndrome some of you that are medical might know this more than others i have it right in front of me but it's actually called broken heart syndrome it's a heart condition that's brought on by a lot of stressful situations and extreme emotions and it's triggered maybe by an illness or by a surgery or by stress you can actually die of a broken heart and if you don't die from it we have people all around us that are living daily and their heart is broken do you all understand that that's why they're on pills that's why they smoke that's why they drink that's why they run around and have parties and have sex parties and that's why they want to watch the olympics when they don't really know nobody and they only never been to japan and they're just caught up in this is sports and this it's entertainment they can sit in their chair and oh oh man that guy look at him well you haven't trained for the last 10 years oh you should have done this you don't know what you're talking about you're you're looking at some camera that's way above the field well why didn't he kick it to this guy he would well you're not down there and sweating it out and your brains have been bushed out and you're watching from some camera in some air condition whatever and you're like you don't have the perception and people that have lived their lives i'm saying this for a reason and you might have a hole in your heart you might have a murmuring heart and we have people right in our churches brother jackson that are literally living with broken hearts they've been broken they've been crushed i mean years ago we used to talk about it maybe in the years of the first years in the 70s and 80s and 90s of the denominations and broken marriages and all this and then we find out in the message then you have broken marriages and now we have children being raised up that don't serve the lord and then it becomes a different attitude toward the lost and toward we have people that are just single mothers or men that don't have a wife sitting next to them and they're literally living with a broken heart and it causes sudden chest pains sharp pains and shortness of breath maybe i better move along is that okay that i'm even saying those things we need to have more healing agents and care for one another listen to one another's testimony i think some of you would be shocked to know what other people's gone through i didn't know that about this man today i talked to at the restaurant i mean how would you live with a hole in your heart then you have surgery and then you live your life then starts giving you troubles and pains and you realize the scar tissue and you have a scarred heart friends i was born and raised in the message in jeffersonville but not everybody is born in the message not everybody had a mother and a father and everyone serving the lord in their family that's fantasy it's not even real there are families where many serve the lord and that's wonderful but all of us have had scars breakages but how long are you going to let that control your life your walk with the lord your walk with the believers the walk in your relationship how long are you going to let that dictate to you your level of joy how long are you going to let that or you why don't you just live every day to the fullest i asked the question this morning we didn't really answer it but do you know how long the average heart surgery takes how many hours the average heart surgery coronary artery bypass takes three to six hours and you're all in the waiting room y'all are listening some of you are fretting some of you on your phone some of you are wanting to go ask your boss how's mother doing how's susie doing how it's three or six it's not a 30-minute sermon that's going to deal with this issue and then if we're not careful we can get a bad attitude god's dealing with issues god's saying things you say well i don't know what you're talking about well the person behind you knows exactly what i'm talking about they might be sitting there right now and their heart is literally broken they're not shouting hallelujah they're not running the pews they're crushed three to six hours heart surgery heart trouble heart condition and then when they wheel you out of the room is it like jump up out of bed and let's go for a marathon no the average recovery time for a bypass heart surgery is six to 12 weeks you need rehabilitation you need to physical exercise where you have professional therapists they help strengthen your heart and they move you back so you can get back on the road again six to 12 weeks you know we want life to just go on like it never happened well you might have to work at that hallelujah it takes time to heal we all want a miracle we all want the situation to stop right now in the end and be over well it's not always going to be like that there might be weeks of working with this and do you all know that when they take out a heart for heart surgery sometimes they literally have to take the heart out and start massaging it and working on it that that person's heart and their life is never the same because they've had human hands touch the heart how many know that it's a proven fact they literally have been proven in heart transplants that is where you need a heart transplant someone else's heart that's passed away in an accident or something and they give you that heart into another person do you understand what i mean you have need of a heart transplant and the average weight for a heart transplant is about five months 144 days you're in trouble you're in need you need a new heart well i want it like right now no you got to go on a list well how long do i got to be on the list well the average is five months so you're waiting you're waiting you're severe you're you're on the list you're on the list and then and something happens do you know that about half of the people on the heart transplantation list have been waiting for more than one year and many people die waiting for donor organs they literally expire their heart stops beating they're in need and if they had a new heart they could be saved many people die waiting for a new heart for a donor organ and we just read scripture tonight in ezekiel a new heart will i give you and my spirit will i give you i think that's an order we all need to take not five months not a year not die while you're waiting receive it tonight we got to go to first base brother we we all want to score home runs and get around and beat the devil oh yeah yeah well you got to get the first base well i don't want to go through the rehabilitation i don't want to go through all the pain well you're going to die to get a new heart it's not going to be a few minutes surgery yo well i gotta go to work frank you don't you might not be alive to work next week i gotta go visit grandma well grandma loves you but she wants you to live do you understand we get so in our mind we're living in another world you're living in your own little world and god needs to say something that'll bring you back oh praise god you think you're having a rough service i'm trudging it out too man i'm working here because the end result is this person's got to live we want them to make it what can we do that that brings spiritual life to the heart of our people what's it going to take to connect with our people because we're living in a dying generation where people are literally dying they're walking around living dead people and when they die if their hearts not right with the lord they're going into a waiting place and then to be at a judgment to go to hell that's just the way that it is i don't care your name your address how much money you give to missions or whatever if your heart's not right with god you're not going to be there you say well maybe i'll be there because i was good and all that well you better friends i don't want to go through the tribulation either you're putting yourself way out there just to reject the word is to reject christ [Music] do you all understand that to reject your day of visitation and god is saying here's an organ done brother cosman here's a new heart this teenager was running and had an accident and they're expired but here here's their heart and that they didn't make it but their heart and we're going to put it inside of you you know that it's proven this is what i was trying to get to that person that got the new heart they will many times have a lot of characteristics in nature of the person that gave them that heart and it has been studied and looked at scientifically it's because the heart carries the traits and the nature oh that's a wonderful thing friends what about the nature of god what about the heart of god how are you going to be when god puts his heart inside of you you're going to love the word you're going to love the message you're going to want more of god i can't get enough of the holy ghost give me more of this love give me more of this spirit i can't get enough of it see why are you acting so crazy because god put his heart inside of me do you know there has literally been divorces within the message when people came to the message i know of them personally where they came to the lord and the the man gave his heart to christ and literally the woman told the judge this ain't the man i married that's what she said she wants a divorce she won't have nothing to do with the message or christ this ain't the man i married and i know that's sad but the man is over here saying in his heart i know i'm not the same there's been a change in me and i don't want to be that old man and i'm sorry friends but we ought to be thankful to god there's been a change in us stop living in hell on earth when outside of the grace of god we'd all go to hell after earth stop living in hell and living in trouble and bad attitude and you know you're just trying to go through life my way or the highway we're not going to think the way you think you literally are thinking the thoughts of the devil you're living in a world all to yourself i'm going to talk to some people and get them thinking the way i'm thinking we don't want to think the way you're thinking and we don't want your attitude you need to read the scriptures we read i'm just being honest and read ezekiel and say a clean heart and he's going to clean you and wash you you need a good bath you need a good shower and a bath and a jacuzzi and you just need to stay in there until your heart's clean your mind's clean thank you sister i know i'm an old-timer but in the old days when you said a bad word your mother she she threatened you and sometimes she did it she washed your mouth out with soap y'all know what i'm talking about dove soap my mother did it sister joyce andy i said something bad when you do that you i'm gonna wash your mouth out with soap it's not a good thing stop cussing then stop saying those bad words hallelujah i have a good mother don't i brother amen well thank the lord it's got to go beyond washing your mouth out with soap it's got to come down to the heart you know you can drink three gallons of soap but you need to go down in your heart it'll clean out your stomach and you'll probably vomit but you need the heart of god you've got to grow up and make this your own revelation this is my god well what do y'all believe about this stop giving them a message book they ask where's christ today you ought to say here is christ hope i didn't offend you all there ought to be enough jesus flowing out of our lives that we can go through hell on earth and torment and brokenness but god has a way of healing amen now i need to get to something here that's what i was speaking about this morning about are we doing okay now he brother branham spoke about this and how the angel came to me and we're going down to the church of brother johnson brother johnson was a pastor and brother branham was going down the steps of his church brother johnson's church and i thought my he the way that he talked to me about this sunday school teacher i'd expect her to be in a straitjacket she's a sunday school teacher in brother johnson's church and but she was mentally gone and so i went down the steps and there stood a nice looking little lady about 30 years old she said how do you do brother branham i said are you the patient she said yes sir i said well what's the matter she said i don't know so i prayed for her and went on a few days after that on the street my wife and i met her and she had two women with her oh she was in such a condition she stepped up into a little place and i prayed for her again and when i went overseas now here's a prophet prayed for her sunday school teacher and she's mentally unstable brother branham goes overseas and she kept calling my wife she said oh if the angel of the lord ever visit him said i can't get out of this city away from here she was afraid she was mentally upset she'd been going to this famous psychiatrist in louisville which is just right across the river from jeffersonville it was louisville she'd been going to a psychiatrist from around eight years twice a week paying money and her poor husband was broke from keeping her and it didn't do no good she just kept on she'd went to every divine healing that came through the country they had them all there they poured enough oil on that girl anointing her to make a gallon i guess they'd stomp devils out they kicked they screamed they hollered everything else trying to and the devil don't care how much you kick and scream he just set right there he knows what he's doing and he knows how much authority he's got he hasn't got none when real faith is standing there but he's stripped of everything he's got but you have to know that i'm telling you tonight you're healed but you've got to believe that and rise up out of your heart condition and say god i can't serve you with this heart i need a new heart and god says well here's a new heart well god i can't serve you with the spirit i'm cankered i'm broken i well i'm gonna give you a new spirit thank you jesus i'm i'm not gonna i'm gonna take you further i'm gonna give you my spirit you say hallelujah i need the holy spirit and god said okay i'm gonna give you a double portion wouldn't you like to be sitting there tonight just gallons and gallons and the angels are just pouring the holy ghost on you and god's here and the holy ghost is here it's like you're the only person in the church you're like hallelujah maybe we need to have more church like that amen and you're just drinking it up and god's pouring it in and here's a lady that has mentally gone 30 years old she's a sunday school teacher in the church married to the deacon in the church we just think everything's fine but it's not fine and she'd been everywhere people have been praying for her from all over the country for years and one morning in the house i know i'm skipping through here i'm trying to save some time but the angel of the lord came into the house and the wife and all of them was there and they said bill let us call that woman little woman i said sure call her and i went out and i was sitting in the room i had to hurry out there my wife said now get this little girl or this little woman she had two or three little children can you all see that she has two or three children and she's mentally just broken yet a sunday school teacher and i walked in there she was only thing i'd seen her these couple times knowed she belonged to the bapti methodist church main street methodist church in new albany and she was sitting there holding her hands like this i said what's the matter says she said i don't know brother branham said i guess i'm just crazy i don't want to ask any personal questions but there's probably times in your life you think lord am i going crazy have i lost my mind i said i don't think so you don't talk like a crazy person to me so i had to get her mind stretched different you see till i could get her off of that thought that's what i've been trying to do this morning and tonight some of you don't even realize it but god's had his hand in your life trying to stretch out your thoughts you're living out in a world all by yourself you're looking at things through some binoculars and it's all fuzzy and you're making decisions off all that fuzziness and god's trying to stretch out your mind to think the way he thinks start looking at it the way he's looking at it that's why you're in that condition and while you have such trouble you're looking at it wrong oh your heart's wrong and god's saying i'm here to give you a new heart this sister was in trouble i said let's take a little trip and let's go back and he starts talking about the word a little bit in a few moments i felt the angel of the lord pulling into this channel and when i did i seen a little black car running like that right across my room i said was you ever in an accident she said no sir now on the platform i'd have prayed for her and let her go i wonder how many of our church services are ending like this we hear a word we pray and we all go and that's why there's people sitting right in our churches like this totally going crazy i'm being real honest tonight you might call me crazy i'm just saying by experience there's things that go on it's just like this people pray and they go out and we're going right back to square one they're going crazy they're living in another world they're a sunday school teacher they're a deacon they're whoever they're just they're gone they're living in another world and we need our services to go out into that world and bring them back and catch that young lady's wondering spirit and bring her back god help us tonight i know we're in a time crunch and it's late in the evening but this is heart surgery she had two or three children now on the platform paragraph 42 i'd have prayed for her and let her go but i had her before me so i watched it again just a minute and the first thing you know hear it come and i seen the vision break then come right straight in and it caught me no way of getting away then i said i see a little car you're sitting by a blond-headed man [Music] and there's an automobile coming and you pass then there's a big light it's a train and there went the vision she let out a scream and jumped on the floor and fainted jumped out on the floor and so the vision went on so she's laying on the floor she fainted here it was when she got married just before her husband went overseas and just a few weeks she was a young woman this last war he went overseas and her being just a girl she started running around being lonesome she started running around with another man and she went out in a little car with him one night and lived untrue to her marriage vow and on the road home was almost killed by a train i told her all about what she had did and then when she raised up off the floor remember she had fainted she's getting back up screaming to the top of her voice and the wife come in there and said what was the matter she said brother branham don't you tell that to nobody what are you talking about heart trouble i'm not talking about the symptoms and going crazy she's in a world i'm talking about heart trouble and when the great physician puts his finger on the heart trouble don't tell that to nobody that was her first response i said i thought you told me you was a christian she said i am i've confessed that to god years ago i said god it wasn't god you sinned against it was your husband and your marriage vow you as a married woman i said you'll have to go make that right with your husband if you ever get well oh she said i can't do it it'd break our home up she said i've got three children and she said my husband will leave me i said now lady i've done all i can do i said you know there isn't a psychiatrist in the world can pull that out of you i've been to a psychiatrist the last eight years two times a week he never said nothing about that they didn't know that and even if they did probably the psychiatrist is doing the same thing anyway what's wrong with that we all got things in our and go out on some tangent friends it's not those things that's going to bring deliverance only being in the presence of god and having a gift of god and have that exposed then you got to respond right well don't tell nobody well that's probably all that's like sounds like cain am i my brother's keeper sounds like a adam the woman thus now gave me it's the old nature i thought you told me you were a christian well no no no and she goes right into i've got children my husband will leave me it'll break up our home brother brahm said there isn't a psychiatrist in the world can pull that out of you that's way back in the gable end of your soul and you just you subconsciously think of it till you got yourself from that condition i said that's the whole thing brother brown said now that's the truth you know it's the truth there's no other person in the world but you that man and me that knows this now she said that's right but said i just couldn't make it right i said well that's all i can do. he said well you're not going to leave brother branham was probably going like this you know i got to go and there's people right on the other side of the wall he was living in jefferson i got to go i've already told you what to do i've already told you you went to the heart of the matter god was good to you it's the goodness of god she wasn't taking it like that oh it's the goodness of god that god's even talking to you like this tonight you might not be this same person but god's talking to you in a way that's his love and grace to even bring it to your attention now what are we going to do about it wow well here we are and brother branham's like um you're not you're not going to leave me she said yes yes ma'am there's a man sitting in this room is this this man here he's very seriously ill fevered in the morning i said i've got to go in there's some more people coming she said oh i can't sin what must i do i said go call your husband and make it right get right get the thing clean that's the only thing to do it she said well she said i just can't do it i i'll die just started on like that and oh brother madam happened to look around and all of a sudden something starts happening something forming by the side of her and i looked it's another vision and there stood a man black-headed combed his hair over kind of sideways kind of wavy a little older than she was i said your husband is a black-headed man she said yes sir kind of tall yes sir isn't he a deacon in the church she said yes sir i said he works for a chevrolet company doesn't he yes sir i said he has the same thing to confess to you then brother branham said something that applies to this local church and any other church no wonder brother johnson can have a revival no wonder the local church can have a revival there's sin in the church the sunday school teachers in sin the deacons in sin nobody wants to say nothing about it god bless you brother god bless you sister thank you for talking about noah and daniel and the lion's den well it's so wonderful give us a star let's all go home let's all live happy right we're not happy we're going crazy and the devil's in the fine print so the church is locked up [Music] no revival no stir their sin in the camp there's unconfessed sin brother branham said this no wonder brother johnson can't have a revival i said looky here now this is real this is good this is uncovering things i said your husband when he landed in france this is years ago he he taken a girl and i told what he did and i said there's a woman now years ago this happened now he's coming up to just a few days i a woman works in the office and she was wearing a pink dress she was in a green chevrolet car no more than three days ago he's guilty of the same thing not my husband see how we live in a world she's living in a world of condemnation she's got a complex she can never for years be the right kind of wife right kind of person because subconsciously it's affecting her but the deacon did it years ago he's trying to shove it back and shove it back and not years ago in france but a few days ago would you all admit we've got a problem we got trouble we got heart trouble we got a serious issue and that's why there's no revival in the church you're trying to put your finger on it that's what it is it's heart trouble i want to say something here tonight there's healing for heart trouble are you just going to allow that to go on brush it under the carpet well brother branham's talking like this to a lady about the husband and saying this this what he did who he was with color the car color the dress three days ago he's guilty not my husband brother madam just says well you all better get things right you better call him up so mita got to talking to her persuaded her to do it she went and called her husband thank god for a godly wife and they got in the car and media wasn't saying you just divorced him deacon in our church big hypocrite you know broke up a home there would have been three children without a daddy and a mommy no no mita was part of the team she helped persuaded her called the husband they got in the car they met out on the road she said i want to tell you this is the lady talking to her husband she confessed it all amen wow this is what i did this is what happened in the car it was so amazing the train came but we almost were hit by a train i'm sorry brother branham said she confessed it all he was looking at her and and she said well now didn't you go out with this woman the office woman here two or three days before that was in the screen chevrolet car and she was wearing a p and he's how do you know it where you been this is the man talking to his wife i'm sure his mouth was going like who you been with where you been so she told her where i've been and he said honey let me show you the body language it wasn't like who you been with well it was like by now it's like honey now my guard's down you got me you you've confessed your sin you've just told me and honey that is the truth and i will admit it's the truth and if you'll forgive me i will forgive you and will raise our children and start life right amen it wasn't three hours you weren't meeting my needs and you weren't meeting my needs well you said this and you said that and if you would have only been it wasn't three hours later and their hair standing up and you're hiding things and you're not telling all you're gonna keep going crazy it was like we confess it all honey that's the truth you forgive me i forgive you praise be to god you know you say brother john you are way out on a limb no i'm not i'm talking about revival in the church we're about ready to have revival the sunday school teachers in sin the deacons in sin but god by his gifts brought it to the surface not a broken home but let's bring this together and let's go on and serve god then god can move see you can know all about the issues but having the answer is a whole nother thing in a few minutes they came back up the steps tears streaming down their cheeks aha satan lost his hold them there's where it's at that settled it but as long as that sin was under there no matter how loud you scream how hard you stomp how much oil you pour on how loud you pray or how easy you pray or whatever you do the devil will stay right there because he has a legal right as long as you've got unconfessed sin somebody say praise the lord how many like to see revival in the local church then you've got to have revival in the home you've got to have mothers and fathers and children realizing we have heart trouble we have needs but i confess i'm not right i've had it wrong it's not trying to understand all this and why you are and your daddy and your mom my friend just forget all that just say you're wrong i'm wrong i'm sorry let's go on and serve god hallelujah somebody say praise the lord there's healing in the house healing is here healing for the heart now that was way way way way down on the inside covered over by a lot of layers of issues and matters but the lord jesus was looking way beyond all that and some of us tonight just need to say lord whatever it takes give me a new heart give me a new spirit jesus can we say amen a broken and a contrite heart god doesn't despise in fact god is very near to someone that has a broken heart god bless you tonight you think well if i'm ever going to be a strong christian enough i'm ever going to do this no he is nigh unto those that are of a broken and a contrite heart amen god bless you today you've been a very patient congregation and that's wonderful i just pray the lord will bless you bless your lives i'm not a great big soccer lover but some of you might have heard in the news in the last several weeks of a they had the danish they had the soccer champ tournaments going on in europe and there was a danish soccer player that collapsed on the field from denmark did anybody hear about that he was his young player christian eriksen was his name and my he was 29 years old one of their star players and he's running running running he was on the team and all of a sudden he collapsed he suffered a cardiac arrest it was a denmark was playing finland in a euro soccer match his heart stopped and he literally had to be resuscitated on the field with a defibrillator this happened on saturday june the 12th one article said they revived him they brought him back and i was just thinking about that not so much about soccer or this but if a natural player of a soccer game can be revived and brought back to life can a spiritual life of a person be revived and brought back to life you're running well you're going along all of a sudden something happened and it just puts you out of commission it's like moved you off track and then you collapse and it's oh you're suffering all the players they formed kind of like because he was being resuscitated they formed like a wall around him this was their player and he was he was down he was out and if a natural player can get up now and then he was revived and they that team went on it inspired the team for many many games they went further than ever would have thought because of the inspiration of this that he was brought back to life then what about a son or a daughter of god that has been living and walking then all of a sudden they get hit over there there's no life there's no energy there's no desire can god bring them back again i'm asking you a question tonight i'm a visitor coming to dallas is that possible that god revive and bring them back again where they can walk they can run they can live they can eat food they can rejoice stop putting all the glory out there in science and the world it's god that heals i'm not here to talk about that soccer player that man from denmark 29 year old man christian was his name i'm here to talk about you or other brothers and sisters in the body is it possible they could be right around you near you and they fall out but god has another plan to revive them to heal them to get them back up on the road again they will live again then where's our attitude tonight where's our spirit at have you lost all hope have you got so old now have you have you accumulated so much in your life that you just don't hardly believe no more i say god forgive us of that and give us a new heart and a new spirit if i've lost something in the battle put it back into me lord hello soldiers i'm leaving you in a few minutes to go but may god breathe into your life may the great physician take your heart and if he's got to bring it out here massage it a little bit and put it back in or if he's just got to take out a stony heart and say we're going to have to start all over and put a new heart in and put a new spirit in and just say you know what that spirit is so contentorous and stubborn i'm going to give them my spirit where you can just say glory be to god that's exactly what i want anyway don't stop with a church life don't stop with just being a good person you can be a sunday school teacher you can be a deacon you can be a preacher you can be whatever but our hearts need to be right [Music] as all our musicians come please there was a service brother branham i want you to listen brother brennan preaches a message influence some of you are familiar with this i want to close with this it comes to the message influence talking about isaiah and uzziah you know that he's coming to the end of the meeting he'd preached for a long time and this is after the seals 1964. he starts singing that song millions now in sin and shame are dying have you ever heard that song listen to their sad and bitter cry so the atmosphere was good he was talking about how millions are dying and crying then he starts giving the call i want everyone to listen brother branham starts giving the call i'm inviting you he said to the altar if there's a backslider here would you come to christ then he says anyone without the baptism of the holy spirit nobody moves he said well i presume that that no one's backslid everyone here must be prayed up and if you're prayed up and if you haven't got the baptism here's your opportunity nobody moved he said i'm not much into persuading i believe the holy spirit is the persuading one oh finally one man comes oh i said one man in here that doesn't have it bless his humble heart i trust it's another isaiah now this church service that brother branham was in was a lot bigger than this meeting there were hundreds of people and brother branham gives a call like this backsliders salvation you need the whole nobe buddy comes and finally one man comes and stands there brother batman said i trust he's another isaiah then he says let's everyone you can open you can raise your heads now. he said you can just play something sister seiler now brother branham's talking to a packed out church of hundreds of people he said i'm going to tell you what you've done you've done the horriblest thing you have ever done he said there was two or three hundred people here ought to be at the altar i'm closing with this kind of stern example brother branham by discernment said there's two or three hundred people ought to be up at this altar you've done the most horriblest thing you could have ever done then brother branham drops back into discernment an 11 examples he starts calling people out number one here sits a lady with a white coat on she's a christian she has arthritis number two the next man sitting there something wrong with your eyes with your ears god can heal your ear trouble the next man right next to you suffering with heart trouble needs oh mr blackwood he gives his name you're from riverbank california stand to your feet number four the lady sitting right next to you there's got a nervous trouble you can be healed of your nervousness raise your hand the lady net sitting next to you has sugar diabetes with the red dress on god she wants to be prayed for oh here's a lady sitting way back here she's ready for an operation oh god she has a fallen womb her name is miss blackswell believe sister don't you have a prayer card and oh who did she touch never touched me number seven mr stewart would you want to be healed too nervousness god makes you well you suffer you suffer with nervousness i thought nervousness was just something like nervous you suffer with nervousness are we doing okay now this is brother branham now you can listen to this tape he's calling out names situations you this number eight here's a lady sitting behind you she's got nervousness too something wrong with her muscles and and the the sister screams out loudly you can hear that on the tape she screams it's like he knows my name he know i'm nervous too and number nine there's a lady sitting there she's got heart trouble high blood pressure number ten the lady sitting next to you something in her chest number eleven tell the lady sitting next to her she has gross on her face little tumors like all throughout the whole building eleven he drops back and gives brother baby said there's a group of you in here that ought to be at this altar seeking the holy ghost that's thus saith the lord he said i'm going to make the call one more time and he he gives the call he said god's speaking to you people i'm not telling you nothing wrong friends it's the holy spirit calling there's hundreds in here i'm telling you in the name of the lord you've been deceived that's pretty incredible if you would have had a religious spirit on you you'd have been like well who is this telling us it's the most horriblest thing we've done and we've been deceived but brother branham was exactly right he goes on to sing the song a little bit like brother steve would sing a song and then pretty soon the people started responding responding they're screaming out they're crying millions now in sin and shame or crying he's asking no ministers come around pray with the people those seeking for the holy ghost and the holy ghost and the whole audience was just being moved then brother branham says the isles are packed full the altar is packed full there's about 150 200 people probably most of us would have said praise god we really had a meeting and a prophet said you've been deceived you've done the most horriblest thing you know what it was they should have responded the first time is that right they should have responded to the word we're 2021 and sometimes we just close a service and we go out and maybe that one little brother but i wonder sometimes how many needs are among us brother benham said there's two or three hundred of you ought to be at this altar and he said oh it's all packed out now ministers coming up and down you say wow we had a revival no that's not a revival the revival is the one that responded to the word we're 20 21 and if god would bring a gift and then start discerning our needs and our addresses and our i'm sure this whole building they'll be crying out on people but friends that's not the response that god's looking for god's looking for the one he's looking for the two he's looking for the altars being packed out or you that are sitting out there to come to a revelation i need help or i'm in trouble to make that decision without someone saying your name and your need and for brother john now to take 15 more minutes and tell you what your address is and what you've been thinking and friends that's not going to keep you in a time of trouble we need the response to be at the word of god now i really labored to close with that because that's a great need today among us we're sunday night it's time to go and we're tired and we're i know we are but god help us not to have a congregation full of hundreds of people that won't respond to the word yet they will respond to some little gift some little emotion some little this and you can hear the people oh they're crying god help all of us do you agree we're years down the road and god took that gift off the scene most of us brother david brother billy brother matthew brother andrew now myself we would just maybe close the service and let's all go home don't be living here and literally be living in another world and your mind crazy sunday school teacher deacon preacher whoever you are don't let satan do that to you with heart trouble heart condition be willing to admit it be be willing to confess openly you don't need a prophet or a prayer line you just need to be honest after hearing the word today and go do the right thing under the anointing and the power of what you heard today has enough chemistry in it to change your body let's stand to our feet lord jesus i pray tonight as we've heard your word been long this morning and long today if you see the time code on the service it's two or three hours forgive us lord if it takes that long to get through our hearts and our minds and the busyness of life and the weariness oh jesus come to us lord as your people fill us with your presence heal those that are sick those that are wounded those that are broken i'm asking lord jesus for your presence now to come like oil and put oil put wine onto those wounds heal the brokenhearted for you came this was one vindication of your ministry you came to bind up the brokenhearted and heal those that hearts were broken jesus if there's someone here who is crying out maybe they don't even understand their need or the depth of it would you answer their cry lord would you minister to every single person that you minister to their hearts minister to us jesus we want to see a change in our families and our church and our relationships as we drive down the road lord let us be willing to talk about the things we heard today and not about the news and the politics and something funny something goofy some joke some how's the children doing how's the job going but let us be willing to just take that step that spiritual step oh father heal our land take away anything in our lives that's not right with you and give us courage and strength to do the right thing lord if it needs to be another step after the service there needs to be another step lord something made right give that person strength and courage to go back to their father their mother their husband their wife or someone else and make something right so that we don't have to live with that condemnation no more bless your holy name do you know that song i give myself away i
