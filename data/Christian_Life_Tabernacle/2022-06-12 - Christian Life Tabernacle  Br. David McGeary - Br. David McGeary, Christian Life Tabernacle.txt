here to pour out of himself amen amen will fight brother tim salah to come in opening a word of prayer in a psalm reading this morning amen [Music] good morning to you welcome to the house of the lord sorry you've got the back up this morning but the bike is out he's gone to louisiana to get his girls as he calls him uh i know they've experienced a little sickness over there we want to remember them in prayer praise the lord bring them through all of that it's a good thing to come to the house of the lord we're going to read a psalm this morning 92. my bible labels it as a song for the sabbath day so i think it's very applicable how many are still feasting on the blessings of what brother billy brought us duty of expression i know i have it's been a benefit to me this week and even that subject title alone is a paradox in that it's our duty to do what the lord has called us to do fulfill our place but he does the expression and so many times we feel it's our duty to express god and we work it up we try to try to do the right things we try to produce fruit and that's not what we're called to do man we're just called to believe his word he said if you love me you'll keep my commandments amen i'm going to jump over to john 15 right quick and bring this to you sis jesus speaking it says i am the true vine and my father is the husband every branch in me that bears not fruit he taketh away and every branch said bear fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i and you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me in this cast forth he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned and here's the promise that goes with that if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you amen that's our desire this morning and i'll i'll read a quote from uh you must be born again in 61 brother braham says when you're born again god vindicates you that's the fruit i added that he said that's how god vindicates all of his nature what by their fruits that's the way he vindicates his ministry that's right all of his servants are vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it's a peach tree because it bears preach it brings peaches how do you know it's an apple tree it's bearing apples how do you know it's a christian christian signs bear from it christian life comes out of it how do you know he's a teacher the word comes from him how do you know he's a prophet the word comes through him bears a record vindication it proves itself how does it become that when it dies and becomes one that's right when we die and become a new creature in christ jesus it gets us with our calling we stay with our calling the fruits of the spirit follow us when we are his servants when we are born again the fruits of christ's life follows us amen how do you know he's a christian he acts like christ he walks like christ he talks like christ he lives like christ above sin victorious what does he do say see what i've done christ didn't do that he gave all his praise to the father that's right how do you know it by their fruits you shall know them let's go to the lord in prayer before we read the psalm oh lord as we come in the assembly of this congregation lord we feel as the prophet isaiah lord i'm a man surely of unclean lips and lord i have need that you take a coal of fire off the altar lord purge my lips my mind lord you've sanctified my heart but lord we're humans we fight the devil in every turn lord lord we know we're sanctified and set aside for your service but lord we come in the presence of an almighty god you say woe is me so this morning lord we we pray that we can set aside all these things lord as we rub shoulders with the world we come into this congregation of people lord that are destined for a better place than this lord that we're going to spend eternity with we're thankful and gracious lord that you've allowed us to come together lord we can lift up songs of praise and worship lord and may we be lifted up as well may you take these old tired weary bodies lord cast them aside and like abraham and sarah lord restore us back to youthful bodies at least while we're in your presence lord lord you may benefit us and that way when we hear the word of god lord we can say that's me i believe it i accept it apply it to our lives lord for having been in the service we've drawn closer to you granted lord if there's any sick or needy in our presence also lord we pray for them those that are on the request list that are near and dear to our hearts granted lord jesus as we read this psalm lord may it just be quickened to us in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray amen amen pardon me psalm 92 and to go with that verse 12 it's been on my heart since brother george was here and it kind of quickened something to me it says the righteous shall flourish like the palm trees shall grow like a cedar in lebanon 13 rather those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god amen that's what we desire to bear fruits i mean if we get it right we stay in his word it's a promise we will bear righteous fruits psalm 92 let's read it together it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name almost high to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon the heart with a solemn sound for thou lord has made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish man knoweth not neither does a fool understand this when the wicked spring as a grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed forever but thou lord are most high for evermore for the nine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered but my horn shall thou exult like the horn of a unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh oil mine eyes also shall see the desire on mine enemies and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god they shall bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing they show that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him blessed amen god bless you i have your seats [Music] all powered oh

great work there we ask it in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning is everybody happy is there anybody who's not happy this morning well good we can go home all right amen you love god's word god's word's great uh let's turn over in the book of um i believe it's thessalonians here and uh the second thessalonians and the third chapter and we want to read five verses amen how many knows you can study the word of god but god makes you live the word of god and he's got ways of doing things that are beyond finding out amen but he's good isn't he he's really good amen so let's read these things i think this is great it touched my heart and gave me great comfort it says finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith but the lord is faithful whom shall establish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the lord touching you that you both do and will do the things which we command you and the lord direct your hearts unto the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ amen gracious father we ask you to bless your word in jesus precious and holy and anger we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning uh i don't know exactly how that i want to approach there was a certain subject on my heart and on my mind that i wanted to preach and yet it would tie to this but i never could get to it just the way that i wanted to but there there's there's something that i think that uh our all of our goals are and it's good to have goals i uh our goals are christian goals and uh you know i i was sitting this morning and thinking and when brother tim was reading that psalm and i i couldn't get it marked down quick enough but there's a part in there about keeping us in our age or something about that age well today's brother tim's birthday amen i think he just turned 30 something like that plus a little but uh so you know that's great and and it's a great comfort uh uh to know that you you really you're just one day older to being young again and and that's the great thing and we have a great change waiting for us and uh and that's what we we kind of been talking about is that we know that there's a perfection that we all want to come to and uh i think by our study and the revelation given to us in this day and the things that have been shared with us we understand that that our lives were pre-planned by god so that's what we have we've come to realize that god's got a reason and a purpose for everything and in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and everything that was made and everything that was done and everything that's transpiring is by that word so in the beginning god created now and he was the author is that correct and the finisher of our faith so he just didn't write it and said now go finish it he just didn't draw out a map and then tell you to follow it no he's he's not that kind of god he's a shepherd and so the the shepherd he will even leave the 99 and go out and find the one that that's lost and he picks it up and he puts it on his shoulders and and bears it back to the flock and and he'll do whatever he has to do to that little lamb to help it uh grow and mature and not be devoured by the wolves so he knows if that lamb leaves the flock and and goes out that that he's going to go into places that will cause uh that lamb to come into harm's way and that great love of that shepherd we're told is that he may sometimes take that lamb and hobble it uh and and by and sometimes hobbling you know what hobbling is where they tie two of your uh you do that to horses and stuff you tie two of their things together and they just can't run off so he hobbles it he says sometimes the shepherd would go as far as as breaking the lambs at the joint he would separate that joint or what we call break that lay so that he would have to be the one to keep that little lamb close and feed it and nourish it because that lamb wasn't over but what that lamb learned from that is he learned to stay close and you know sometimes you know god hobbles us and he does that by by allowing resistance to come in against the ideas and plans that we have sometimes that we're taught that sometimes god has to put us flat on our backs looking up at the ceiling in order to get our attention but all this comes under one great promise that i will not lose one amen so no matter the battle and struggle that we're having in this life no matter the different places that we find ourself in and the different troubles that we get ourselves in god has an end for us he knows what our thoughts are he knows what his thoughts are towards us and he knows what he wants to accomplish and so we know that we are striving for a perfection ami believes that the scripture says be perfect as he is perfect and there seems to be within us a natural force taking place and so i i don't know how to go back and kind of segue into this thought but even uh within us there's something inside of us isn't there and when you're striving for perfection and you're doing all that you're doing and you're living right and everything is right and you think is good all of a sudden something will rise up in you that you're not satisfied with where you are you should be satisfied you know what i mean i i've i've got a a a shiny new truck that brother daniels put together four or five times for me and painted it and polished it and patched it but it's a good truck you know i'm happy with that truck you know what i mean and things will be going good in your life and all of a sudden there's a thirst or a hunger or something that that you just know there's more you know you know there's more and and there is more for us and that's what we're looking out for and and god's got a pathway so there is there is a perfection that's happening in the bride but i'd like to switch over before i read uh several quotes this morning with you out of the book why christ speak is that we know there's two vines don't we we know there's the uh that every revival has twins and you know twins grow up together do you understand that in other words one twin doesn't get older than the other twin except by a few minutes you know i mean i think we have two or three sets of twins i'm not sure but i and if you talk to their parents they're born minutes apart or hours apart but i think usually when they have a birthday they have it together you know and you know i mean because they're so close together so you've got to remember that that things are allowed to grow up together right okay so we we our our understanding of things as we talked this morning so we also know that there are two types of seeds right there's the wheats and the tares and they were sowed and the scripture tells us that the lord told us to let them grow up together so we realized that there is a perfection of the elect taking place there's a perfection of the bride taking place so we know in the two vines we would call it two brides with satan uh jesus has a bride his church and satan has a bride and it's his church now so satan's bride in church is also coming to perfection and maturity so understand that okay as you sit here looking for a a separate perfection and a separate maturity in in the world today because satan's bride is is is coming to maturity they're also striving and growing for a perfection and seeking for ways amongst themselves to come to that perfection and and they'll have maybe disagreements within themselves different uh political standpoints and political views and they might kind of act like they're divided into democrats and republicans or socialists or progressives or or all the terminology but you've got to remember the only reason that they are struggling and going through what that they are going through is because they are trying to reach a perfection satan's trying to bring them into perfection and and every time that they they seemingly take a stand this way or stand that way and the media is out there writing the story out and the radio talk show hosts are blah blah blah blabbing you know and they're talking heads are just bobbling up and down all the time satan's in control they think that they're in trouble but he's the prince of the air the prince of this world we've got to be careful that we don't get caught up in what we would perceive as their struggle but their struggle is just the tool that their master and their leader is using to bring them to perfection so he wants them to reach a certain place and a certain achievement now we're talking about that there's another perfection going on so i mean it's not just that god's perfecting his bride satan's perfecting his pride and he's got a way that what he does to perfect the bride and we we sit back from the outside well we've got to sit back from the outside you understand we've got to stay out of it a good soldier doesn't entangle himself with the affairs of the world but but you you you've got you want to be uh harmless as a dove but you still want to be wise you you've got to understand though you might think it looks like chaos and those you can't understand this political view and that political view and i'm a liberal and i'm a conservative well i i'm both i'm a liberal in the spirit amen i've been liberated hallelujah praise god thank you jesus glory to god amen that ain't out of our life style [Music] you know i mean but i'm i'm i i'm conservative when it comes to sin and the things of the world i don't get involved in those things amen so i don't care what's going on out there and what appears to be chaos and what appears to be a conflict and issues and everything but believe me all satan's doing is preparing them to become a hundred percent reliable on him and he's already got a great big religious organization he's already got a guy crowned he's already got a vicar of christ here that will just swoop in and bail her out you know they'll they're they're growing to a perfection they're growing to a maturity now we talk about attributes don't we and the manifestation of attributes but you know satan's bride and his church his worldly spiritual church because we fight spiritual wickedness in high places right he's the prince of the air i mean he's he you know he's not a myth he's real and every day he's recruiting members he's spreading out his power he's taking control he's taking the control of the the the minds of the people there's a lot of tragedy in the world but tragedy uh uh and and threats and things changes the whole course of of uh situations you know one time a man tried to sneak i don't know if it was a little bit of explosives or a little something in his shoe one man right one shoe one heel one airplane flight what did that do it had everybody in the world taking off their shoes when they get on an airplane think of it one man with one shoe probably not in his right mind caused everybody to take off their shoe is that right i don't know some of you don't travel i know some people travel and they take off their shoe anyway i don't know but i'm just trying to be a fact okay well then they got pushed over to this side so they said oh we can't be making everybody take off a shoe so now they've gotten a special elite group of people you're called a trustee traveler they now decide to trust you that you won't put an explosive in your uh shoe and they place a little mark on you called i think is it tsa or something like that well that's uk pre-check oh tsa now you're in a special group of people i don't like the idea i've been pre-checked but i don't like the idea of me taking my shoes off either so now we're making choices between lesser evils so satan is driving the world to where he wants it to be if you don't think he's not in control of the world then why did he offer all the worlds to the lord he said look out here are all the kingdoms if you fall down and worship me i will give you all these kingdoms of the world i'll give them to you and he said get behind me satan you know thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and so we see that he is also building attributes his attributes his thinking and you say well is that true well let if we just jump to the other side of the aisle uh uh so i'm looking out this way so if i say well this is satan's bride on this side well you don't feel that that's satan's bride because you're looking this way so this side to you is this side over here so it doesn't but so if you you look on this side he's bringing them in the mind but this over here he said let this mind be in you that was in christ so if he's trying to perfect if we feel that we brought into perfection by having the mind of christ don't you think that they've got to be brought into perfection to having the mind of their husband and that's what's going on he another all i want us to do is to stand back and look this morning and understand that there's two perfections going on don't stand in awe of what's happening in the world you might think that they're they're all separated and divided but all that separation and dividing is doing is causing them to realize that in order to survive they're going to have to become one and he'll starve him out if he has to he'll do whatever it takes to get them to the place where he sits on the throne of their hearts their thoughts their minds and their lives he'll bring them to the place where they think they have peace and safety but remember sudden destruction is going to come so we understand that he's he's got this great uh this great bride and this great display and what he's doing is is satan's attributes are all on display all his attributes are on display his whole kingdom is coming to maturity the the spirits in the maturity are are gaining influence and and they have media and social media where they can spread his message just like that and we cannot sit back and be totally ignorant of the fact that there is another kingdom growing up right alongside of us and you cannot remain neutral you can't serve to master do you understand the more they move into perfection and the more they move into maturity and the more they take form and the more that they gain the ability to express you don't think that that spirit's not moving in their kingdom you can choose what gender you want to be i mean that's nuts i mean that [Music] marriage is is not the definition of marriage doesn't exist any way the way we knew it all it is is an economical and tax contract between two people and everybody should get same tax privileges so in our country if you're married and and you have a wife then you got a special tax privilege so everybody else said well i don't like i'm with a man well you need to call that marriage so i can get a special tax privilege you know remember the love of money is the root of all evil all these things are driven by money all these things are are driven by the social structure it it it's it's driven by something and people's minds are being changed people's thinking is being changed his kingdom is trying is starting to take hold and and as it takes hold and as he gains strength and he gains maturity he is going to wash out everybody that's not part of it and you don't want to be be found in that group that's washed out of his group but you're not part of his bride either because that's what's going to be spewed out of his mouth oh i just might as well you know i hope you understand that when he says be either hot or cold but don't be lukewarm else i'll spill thee out of my mouth that that wasn't actually going to be produced in the form of a system and in the lives of men the word of god is not little catch phrases the word of god is coming to pass every day [Applause] lukewarm is was produced by hot and cold lukewarm is produced by the bride of jesus christ and the bride of satan and it produces a bunch of middlemen a bunch of borderliners and you're going to find out neither side wants them so you might as well not be caught in the middle you understand you might as well young people especially those of you that are starting your careers you you you need to ask for isab that you can see that you can see all these corporate things and all these great opportunities and all these job offers and all these stuff you better really pray down to do the guts of your soul to make sure that you're not joining a very deceitful culture and civilization and church everybody in this world goes to church every day they're in church now they now might not be in the house of god or the assembly of god but every day they're worshiping in some church somewhere they're a part of something they're giving their duty they're giving their lip service they're giving their labor they're giving their money to something and in the hour and the time and the prophecy is is is predetermined by god and it's just good for us to wake up and recognize the day and the message and the hour that we're living in and part of that i believe is to recognize the maturity of satan's bride and the maturity of his church and their attributes and their power and how that he's seizing the mind of the people and that is i always like to you know i i don't know how to say this but you have to at least realize that satan is a very good adversary he's very smart he's very intelligent he'll take things so far one way that you'll settle on a compromise which is lesser than the position you held before he's got all these radicals jumping up and crying up and everybody's going oh but all he's done is you say anything less than not and then he offers some little compromise in school some so what did he do first first he took the prayer out of school then he took the bible out of school now he's way over here trying to teach division between people and and colors and races and all that and do you realize how contrary that is to god's word god is no respecter of person amen god is no respecter as a person every man's life has a purpose but not every man's life has a purpose in this world and that's the trouble there's people that are not part of satan's bride there are people that are not part of his kingdom there are people that do not possess his attributes there are people that do not fit in the world and the bride of jesus christ does not fit in this world we're not even of this world we're in this world but we're not of this world we don't even come from this world well we've got to get a real stark realization in us to be able to look out there and say wow satan's bride's coming to perfection they're turning this world into exactly what they want to live they're making it a place that only they can live even so come quickly lord jesus they're pressing for it but the whole reason that he's getting all these attributes and all this great uh maturity and and and he's starting to put on his display is that's to oppress the bride of jesus christ because they're both struggling for our world isn't that what satan did he exalted himself above the stars of god and he placed himself on the throne of the world as if he was god you can't let these things slip church you can't get caught up on friday paycheck and on on your rent and and on your money and and whether you have nike shoes or or whatever shoe you know that you want you you can't let your minds get swallowed up in the littleness of the world we're not in a struggle that's right you understand we're in a war we're in a battle you know i mean we have an enemy that's growing in great strength and maturity and trying to rob from us our thinking our faith our attributes our works he wants to make the bride of jesus christ of none effect that's what he's trying to do so we've got to understand that when we see the day and we see the enemy rising in maturity we see satan taking control of the kingdoms of the world we see him pushing church out you know that for the first time in american history that there's less people go to church in the united states i can only speak the united states then go to church it used to be 60 40 at least americans went and participated in religious services regularly now over 60 percent of our country doesn't go to church at all well they go to church they just don't realize that some of them have a baseball denomination a hockey denomination a football denomination college denomination youth sports whatever it is i mean where they are and and where they scream and holler and worship but so as we see that perfection coming understand that the reason that he's perfecting his church he and perfecting satan's perfecting his church and satan's perfecting his army he's perfecting that army to be in in total opposition to what it is that you are trying to achieve so he's trying to make it very difficult for you to achieve the perfection that you want to achieve and so that's where i want to start reading now because god has a way to perfect his church now satan would like us to use his techniques and his ways and borrow from him but the bride of jesus christ she only comes into existence both of these kingdoms satan's kingdom and his bride and his church and jesus bride and his kingdom and his church are all results of prophecy satan is doing exactly what is prophesied of him you are here this morning i'm speaking to you as believers i'm speaking to you as the bride of jesus christ i'm speaking to you of of because of what you are and who you are you are here because he prophesied for you to be here or he spoke of you to be here that's why you're here he chose you to be here in this hour before the foundations of the world that that he that that's a given right that's why we call ourselves the what the elect the chosen the elect lady the church the bride so we understand that the world is espoused to their husband their god and we are in spouse to our husband now we are espoused by the word of god and and we are only brought and reached out to by the prophecy that was spoken of us america the only reason each of you in your life wherever you were whatever you were doing whether you were in sin alcohol drugs whether you were in prison whether you were in financial difficulty it doesn't matter where you were where you grew up the only reason you got contacted and reached because there was something in you that god put in you [Applause] and that was calling out to him you didn't know it you didn't understand it you didn't perceive it but yet it was working and struggling to get back to the place that it was meant to be it's amazing so let's just read if you would and we'll just go through these things because i think there's some great understanding in some of these things we're going to read in why christ speak and i think they can put it up on the board i hope their program matches my paragraph 29 and that's why christ speak and that's the one that's preached in 1963 i think the 14th of july do we have that i'm not a very good reader so when you can see it on the board it helps me a lot all right so let's just listen to this and we're just going to go through this and point out some things and have some real fellowship in what the prophet of god told us all right he says many times when we look at the scriptures in our own way of looking it seems very hard but if we study it a little while we find out that all that the all-wise god knows just what he's doing so god knew what he was doing when he allowed these two seeds and these two twins and these two revivals to go on simultaneously he knew what he was doing now if i was running the show none of you would be here because i would have wrote it that god comes to the rich in this world [Music] but no what does he come to he comes to the poor of this world rich in what faith so he knows what he's doing he knew he allowed satan to go out there have a bride he's allowing this world to go the way that it's going he's allowing because they're they're there for the sole purpose of opposing you because let me tell you something until something's tested it's just a claim you take some of these brothers that are in trades you know better gyro he's a a drywall guy if i ca if i went and told showed up on his job and said i'm a drywall man he's okay go mix me some mud and go spot nail these things and run that joint over there tape in those corners i'll be back in a little bit well i'll guarantee there'd be more mud on the floor than on the wall now just think of that okay god knows what he's doing amen so i can say make any claim but that claim has got to be brought to a reality if it just remains clean just like the letter of this book and the prophecies of this book they as long as they lay there as prophecy there they are allowed to be interpreted the way that any man wants to but that's not how god interprets his word how does he interpret his word by bringing it to past in other words he takes it from word to reality so remember god's word becomes flesh both sides of the prophecy his bride becomes flesh and the lord's bride becomes flesh they both have to come into a reality they all both have to come into a tested existence so the world tests us to prove if we're what we say we are and the world tests them so they can prove that they are who they say they are no middle ground he knows what he's doing and he knows how to do it these things and how to deal with man god knows how to deal with man everything that's going on god's got control of it he knows how he's this is not this is not me this is what our messenger told us he knows what's in man he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man how many of you really thought someone was really good and righteous and upright and my my my and then all of a sudden you just were so disappointed well i've got a car to sell you it mostly just sat in the garage little grandma had this car i'll tell you she's she's low mileage and and she's a beauty and i'll sell this car you know it's probably worth eight thousand dollars but i'll tell you what i'll sell this car to you for three thousand dollars you know well look at it pete omer says it only has 90 uh uh thousand miles on it well you know this just little old lady she'd go to the grocery store two or three times a day because it's a bag of wind it's a sales pitch it's not the what truth well satan's selling his kingdom how does he sell his kingdom he sells this kingdom through science education and civilization but there's no truth in them you understand there's no truth in the world around us there's no truth in it the outcome of it is going to be destroyed so we have got to focus in and set our hearts to the perfection that god has for us and the fulfillment he is fulfilling the purpose for which god allowed him into the world now we must get to the place where we're fulfilling the purpose that god has put us here for and moses is such a great example of that and he says so he knows what's really in men moses was born in this world this is the next paragraph 30 born in this world a gifted boy and he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment born in him and every man that comes in the world is born with this equipment i think you touched on that some wednesday right that that equipped so every single one of you have been put here for a purpose and within you is the equipment to fulfill the purpose god made you that way the trouble is is it's not a cloned piece of armor that we can go down and buy at the christian store it's developed by the opposition of the enemy because you can't add it right in the statue of a perfect man until it's been proved and tested he said don't try to add uh uh he says if you have faith he said don't try to add virtue until you've got the faith don't try to add knowledge till you've got the strength and the virtue so every test of the way every step of the ladder you've got to have the strength to make every step of the ladder and so as we read here we'll try to move through this quickly he was equipped and born in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment as i firmly believe in the foreknowledge and predestination of god you believe that unless and there's i could just keep reading because every paragraph's wonderful but he said in paragraph 32 therefore when a person tries to be something they are not they are only making an impersonation and sooner or later it will find you out your sins will find you out you cannot cover them there is only one covering for sin and that's the blood of jesus christ and it cannot be applied unless god has called you from the foundations of the world hallelujah that's why religion is a what it's a covering but god knows what's in man another he knows the prophecy that what he spoke of you and what that he's trying to get you to be that's right and we're going to move down you'll listen to this great statement that he makes he said and it cannot be applied unless god has called you from the foundation of the world that's what the blood was sent for not to be trampled upon not made fun of and jabbed at or evilly spoken of and so forth it was for a direct purpose get that established you're elected you're chosen there's something in you you have a blood that came for a direct purpose and that blood is only applied to those whose names were written on the lamb's book of life because he couldn't be a redeemer and a kinsmen redeemer unless he had a kinsmen to redeem amen so you weren't his kin from this world you were his kin from before the world when the sons of god shouted for joy before the foundation of the world this is about getting us back and we don't want we don't need to go into the fall because the evidence of the fall is coming to maturity we want to understand that we are now wanting to come into the reality and to the the prophecy of god being made flesh concerning the rapture of the church and the leaving of his his generation and his people from this world how many believes that's on the agenda how many understand that that's the last thing left on the agenda for the church she's received rapturing faith through the message of the hour the last thing for her to do is leave no other accomplishment but that is what we want to accomplish let's just read if you don't mind with me please that's right so the blood had a purpose the blood was purpose was based on the purpose that god gave you do you understand that he had a purpose for you jackson by no fault of your own you got sucked into this world you came in this world speaking lies you came into this world sin all the situations and circumcisions you didn't pick your parents believe it or not god picked them for you he picked your grandparents for you he picked everything in for you he i and i don't know he may have done it so for you to sit there and say i got no hope so he could be your hope [Music] all the reasons he put you together and made you whatever you were was for his sole purpose and for his soul glory now the blood came not just for jesus to hang on the cross that whoever get there he came for one thing i have got to pay the price for the thing that's keeping this man or this woman from coming to the maturity that i prophesied for him so the only thing that holds most of us back is guilt so he's got a purpose believe me he just didn't drop down become savior of the world no he knew who would and who wouldn't believe he knew who his children were so he made provision for them now remember all this time we're reading this this other kingdom is coming to maturity so we've got to realize quick we've got to start coming to maturity we've got to start taking these things that our messenger laid for us in the storehouse of god's word and making them a reality and living in our flesh that's right not to be played with not to be impersonated by saying that the sins are covered when they're not and no man can have his sins covered lest his name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundations of the world hallelujah so it's it's so simple it's beautiful so if they couldn't be covered unless their names were put there from the foundation of the world what did he do he came to cover the sins of those whose names were written on the lamb's book of the world why did he have to come because he had to cover those why did he have to cover him because your name was there glory to god that takes my righteousness from out of the picture if you can do one thing for your salvation jesus christ died in vain praise god you mean this little wretched mess that i am that can goof everything up there is in the whole world was already in the land's book of life thank you lord praise god don't look like you don't know it i i'll cover every doubter before long because that's what the word of god is for it's to remove the doubt it's to bring that faith alive in you that will rise up and speak against the opposition and won't just cry and and that's what we get into yeah we're in all this struggle and all this stuff that's going on and our life's not working and i got everybody's opposing me and and we'll cry cry cry cry cry you know and like that this city came by the other day and they wrote a note and said you've got to stop work we don't know about this and that and everything and i thought oh that city and i and i was all stirred up inside and i wrote the letters i was going to write and i you know i was back to the old skunk oil on my shoes going through the bank [Music] wait a minute i got the eternal god on my side [Applause] i got the predestinated plan of god on my side god's not here to build buildings god's here to build character god's here to bring me into perfection god's here to put his mind in me that's what god's got a predestinated plan for my life so here i'm reading why christ speak and i'm getting all this revelation i'm jumping up and down and i'd stop for a minute and write some more lines on my dirty letter and okay and just go on and all of a sudden i realize i'm the one that's crying speak and go forward [Applause] i don't got to fight him god fights my battle and that's what said he said pray for me that god will deliver me for unreasonable and wicked men because all men don't have faith you think i was angry at him i pitied him gentlemen what do you want it's hard to fight against god what do you want me to do amen tell me i'll do it i can do all things through christ jesus is strengthening i can build walls i can tear down laws tell me what you want i got to remember what my motive is what my purpose is i i was all shook up now i just can't wait i'm going to go into that meeting and ask them if i can open it with prayers [Applause] i'd like to read a scripture to you lord direct our hearts right okay and so you know i'd like just to go in there say that i'd like to read a scripture uh before we have this meeting something that paul he was a great wise master builder don't you think they had a good advice to take the advice of the master builder right the one who knows how to lay cornerstones right and you know and and just go in there and say he said and he said and and and pray for us you know that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men don't have faith okay i just wanted to say that god's on my side it's hard to fight against god so come on boys whatever you want i'm here to serve i'm here to please i'm here to make all of you look good i'm here to try to get every single one of you in the church and into the kingdom and i can't get you saved till you let me build the church so you can come into the atmosphere and i can't get you to the altar till we provide an altar for you so what can i do to help save your souls you know pretty soon you're not crying you're speaking [Music] because something's transpiring you can't come i can't come into perfection so finally i stayed home all day yesterday you know and by this morning i woke up and i thought lord thank you for having the city shut me down because if i would have worked yesterday i would not be in the pulpit this morning i needed a day of rest the sun was hot the sun was dying i was pressed out to the max and i thought god shut down a airline for a little little lady do you if he needs to shut down a job site thank you jesus why cry okay lord great thank you for the day off you know what lies down the road you stopped it for a reason let us find out what the reason is let's get the solution lord help me help them let us just come to something that works good for everybody and if they're unreasonable in everything we got a god that can deal with that too [Music] so sometimes what i'm trying to point out in all what i just said is sometimes you don't realize what's really taking place but what god's doing is he's making this message by using the oppressor to come alive in you let's just read a few more great things because i want we we're watching the the development of moses come into place he said and then he says this for a direct verse and no man can unless his name is written on the lamb's book of life before they found the world jesus said himself no man can come to me except my father draws him and all the father hath past tense given me will come to me that's right so you can't make the words lie they are there for truth and for a correction amen now we're just going to jump over to another paragraph here and and this is uh and this is paragraph 37 and 38. so he says now he says now then see that he was born with this great gift and quality within him right so haven't we all came to the conclusion that we all were born with the seed of god in us amen now i know at different stages even in our church different people go through the the battle of whether that seeds in you or not but if you're having that battle and you've sat here for the last hour there's a pretty good chance that seed's in you but something's got to happen to that seed so let's just read a little bit okay you're with me am i okay matthew's going to take care of me tonight so i got to get what i have on my heart off he says then he was born with this great gift and quality within him then it only takes something to flash across that to bring that thing to life now just remember it we always talk about the spirit of god flashing across and the word flashing across that's what germinates at the sea too but sometimes it's the very opposition of the enemy that brings it to life you know what i mean all of a sudden you find yourself like you know i the situation i found myself in i'm sitting in a room with a bunch of hell's angels a bunch of motorcycle gang guys a bunch of drug dealers and everything and and there's all kinds of perversion going on men with men and all this crazy stuff and there and they're just over there and they're in my house and boy they're good and pretty soon i see the horns starting to show up and the little tails starting to stick out and pitchforks in their hands and everything and and all of a sudden it's just swooping in on me and they're saying come on chills came over my body i went into the kitchen and i i remember i went over to the stove and and i i opened the oven door and turned on the oven and jumped up on the top of the stove and i sitting on the stove with my feet on the burner just trying to get warm from the heat of the oven what i saw scared the the daylights out of me and i remember i finally went up and and you know and then the police raid and all this stuff going on and i remember finally i just got down on my knees i said god help me god help me i don't know what i am but i'm not this something was brought to life in me you know why god had a seed he had to preserve he had a plan and a purpose that he couldn't fail because he couldn't think it he couldn't prophesy it and not have it come to pass and if your names are written on the lamb's book of life there's no way it can't come to pass that's why the blood came for a purpose only for those whose names were written on the lamb's book of life what a resting place what a covering what a restitution what a price that's been paid and the seed of god is actually placed in us from the foundations of the world and when that light first strikes that seed it brings to life and but the light has to come upon the seed jump over to paragraph 42. you guys go home if you'd like is a wonderful book to read moses being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver god's people now see what these great qualities now see what great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing god had purpose in it god has purpose of you being here see if you could only be get to that place how much trouble you would save god and yourself too [Music] so this is what we've been preaching about from things that are debated this morning we're trying to get to that purpose never before in our lives of christians have we ever had a desire to know what the purpose that god has for our life or if the question may not be that way it may be posed in our heart a different way it's in our heart it's a hunger to do something for god at 56 years old the prophet of god said i i'm 56 now he says if i'm ever going to do anything for god i better get going really i don't got a chance no what was that it was a reflection of the hour he was reflecting what the bride's coming into she's going to have such a desire in her heart to obtain the purpose to come to a realization and the understanding of what the predestinated thoughts are for their particular lives that there's such a deep inside of them calling that when they hear these things my life has been pre-planned the blood was only given because my name was on the lamb's book of life god created me for a purpose and if i could find that place and find that purpose i would save myself and god a lot of trouble well god believe me he'd like to see us mature to the point he has to not shut in every door on us he's not crushing us all the time he's not chastising us all the time he'd surely like to move us up into a deeper greater relationship i'd much rather preach the wonderful riches of christ than preach against all the sinners in the world god has a purpose of you being here now reflect on that a minute he's got a purpose and and i wrote this note down so i'm going to read it because it just he says i put this down it really moved my heart it said just trying to live as a christian in this world is just survival we're not survivalists you understand we're not survivalists we are more than survivalists we are conquerors this isn't where god dumped us off on some island somewhere you know and you're supposed to use your self-survival skills right isn't that what survivalist is i mean i get these things in the mail you know it says uh you better have two years of survival food packed up i just have some just happened to have some to sell you you know here's the one knife if there's if you're not left with anything else in the world this knife will get you through you know it i mean i'll just have tim make me a knife i'll have him pray over and he'll be anointed it'd do a lot better and some survival knife has got a can opener on it and a little saw on it and a little blade on it so it's great if you have to meet the cut and the bottle opener to open and something to saw and boy this is survival survival survival survival i don't want to survive i'm past surviving i'm redeemed i am redeemed by the blood of the lamb because my name was on his book amen think of it so as we're reading he said so i put see we're not we're conquerors we're here to free our brothers and sisters from the prisons and chains of the enemy and bring life and truth let's just finish reading and then we'll have billy lead us in some worship he says and i think this is paragraph 45. i think any man with or woman boy or girl and i think in intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never can have a full foundation until they meet have meant that light to bring that word to reality so satan gets his bride through science education and civilization god brings his word into existence by hearing and making contact with the light i think paragraph 46 i think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and how fundamental it might be that church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something that they can talk to that will talk back to them that a vindication this is written word now that's what we're talking about right because no church nobody of believers can thrive and really be what he is and move to perfection until we totally come to the realization and understanding that there is a supernatural presence that can move in us until each of us takes our place and purpose realizing that this is what you're called to do the works that i do shall you do also no not everybody's a healer not everybody prays for the sin but everybody can make contact and we can't let that down and that context personal i can tell you all day long how god contacted me but you climbing up on a roof and reading romans 1 won't do it for you desperation drove me there i hope you don't have to come to desperation i don't hope you have to be at the edge of suicide in the edge of losing your mind and going totally crazy and not knowing why you're here and what purpose you have and why you're living and sitting there i don't want to live no more i can't take this i i don't know nothing raise the catholic there was nothing there a guy yelled at me why don't you read the bible like if you're going to be so religious mocking me i said i'm done with drugs well why don't you just have we call them joints or reefers or you know marijuana's here why don't you just have one more smoke with us okay i'll i'll do one more so they come back an hour later and they've got one this big and this big around it was a two kilo joint you know if you had to hold the thing like this what was it it was mockery they thought it was funny i'm tore up i don't know where to go i don't even know what life's about i'm screaming inside and then i got on a rooftop and i read romans 1 and there they were truce breakers liar incontinent doing that which was unseemly god giving them over to a reprobate mind and it could and incontinent and just as i read down there i thought oh god what was happening what was happening the word was manifesting in reality i'm finishing up now i i never got to what i really was preaching about and i don't know what i have been preaching about but i think it's good now let's go to paragraph 48 moses knew this intellectually and the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart and he tried through his intellectual experience with the word he tried to bring them out to deliver them because he knew he was born for that purpose he knew that the time the scriptures all said that had already been there for 400 years and just as we know now as a man asked me a few minutes ago about the coming and the rapture we know we're living we've lived in the time we've lived the time out at the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we're living in all right so now we're positioned now we know okay we're here for a purpose right we're here to be the manifestation of the resurrection we're here to be made the word flesh and we're here to get a hold of a supernatural something that will change our bodies i'll just read these paragraphs he says when we see god that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see god who can take a cancer that's eaten a man to the shadow and raise him up to be strong healthy strong man that ought to give us rapturing faith in the people when we can see a god save our sister's toe the blood gets flowing down there and they don't have to lose it that ought to start giving us rapturing faith it ought to start making us realize we're called our names are on the lamb's book of life that's why the blood come in the first place i have a purpose in life he planned my life there's a purpose of the enemies out there to put the pressure on me to test me to bring me to perfection and now here i am and what i'm supposed to be desiring is that i can make contact moses heard it and he believed it but he didn't make contact well don't go down in the dumps if you say well i haven't really had a contact you know what say praise god if i haven't got a contact i've got a predestinate prophesied contact coming don't let satan twist it with psychology and education and civilization and temptation just because you're drawn away with the lust of the flesh doesn't change what you are or who you are if you haven't made contact it's okay that's right you say why because your contact isn't what puts your name book of life it's your name being on the book of life that's why the blood came because your name is on the book of life and he didn't put your name on the book of life he didn't come down and get the blood to cover your sins without also prophesying for you a contact because he has got to bring the word to life so no matter where you are in your life no matter what decision our life is based on hearing the word and then making contact it's always that way when i'm pouting and crying and thinking the world's gonna end you know what i need to do i need to make contact i'm laying there discouraging what am i gonna do you know how i'm gonna fight this david didn't walk up to goliath and figure out how he's going to fight him he walked up there sad the king of israel i just had a prophet anoint me with oil man i'm excited i'm stoked who is this uncircumcised philistine that defies the army of the living god hallelujah i'll fight him he walks up to that old giant that says hey mr giant how are you the giant says you little twerp don't they have a man in israel to send out they had a god in israel he wasn't facing a man he was facing a god [Music] so here he is he's looking at it oh there's so many things in this book about how pharaoh looked at him as mud daubers and all that's a great book great tape if you really want to be blessed go listen to why christ be okay so he looks at him david wasn't there david was was he knew that that giant couldn't win he knew he couldn't win he'd seen god win then he gets up there and he just testified that was the enemy bringing opposition to tests and and that's that opposition because one of the greatest responses that's the message i want to preach was the great responses of the bible but i'll i'll work on it more and save it but look at the response that came out of david god delivered the line into my hand god delivered the bear into my hand and god this day is going to deliver you you uncircumcised philistine who defies the army of the living god it it it bubbles up you you need that contact i think i just laid in his heart this great and i i think that we're finishing 48 and we'll read a little bit and we'll go experience with the word he says he tried through an intellectual experience of work and tried to bring them out to deliver because he knowed he was born for that purpose you see what he already had settled in his heart he was born for a purpose and you may make mistakes you may try things you may struggle but believe me god's with you the scripture said that they were already been where they had already been 400 years so he says now we know as a man asked me a few minutes ago about the coming of the rapture we know we're living and time has run out the rapture is him we're looking for the rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we're living in is that right so and then he said he said and i'll go back to 45 and i think any man or woman boy or girl and i think in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is so forth they can never have full foundation to stand on until they meet the light that brings that word to reality malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. it shall be light in the evening time they'll never have the foundation never until they come to the meet the light that brings it to the reality and i and i know because i've got kids that went to church and the only reason they went to church is because i made them now matthew's going to preach tonight in the front of the church but i remember the days he sat on the back row because he was running around all night you know and you know davey he'd be there jumping up trying to catch wasps in church you know what i mean and and and he's not there they're everywhere but what what's your hope your names are written your hope is they'll come from across the light and for everybody that you sit here and your parents believe the message and you're stuck in the message church and this is your religion just for one moment just say lord we listen to tapes let me see the light that preach these tapes let me see the spirit that does all these works that i see let me feel the anointing that caused these testimonies let me make contact because we're growing in the word we're growing in the knowledge of the word but where we're lacking is in the contact the personal contact the individual everyday contact that we need we see god can raise the dead we've seen that yes there's got to be something that happens this is backed up that paragraph he he says that when the light flashes from the sky and the trump sounds the body of christ shall be quickened together and changed in a moment and taking into heaven yes there's got to be something like that happen and our schools of theology can never produce that yet the intellectually are all right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something and moses based his great call upon the word and it was great until one day he meant that light and the very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing that anointed what he had in him on the inside amen it anointed what he had in him on the inside so i know each of us has a purpose and it's easy for you to look at me and think well you're a pastor your church you've got your purpose no i work because i believe but there may be a greater purpose in my life wait but on this it may be to pray for one soul it may be but it's got to be a hunger and then thirst for that purpose there's no big eyes that will use achievements aren't measured here they're only measured in your personal relationship with jesus christ and what you believe in fulfilling what you feel he has for you to do and moses is great calling the word and until one day he meant the light and the very word itself spoke back to him and he got his anointing the anointed that was it was on the inside of him the intellectual that believed it the faith that was based up upon his belief in god that separated him from his mother and now when it strikes in the presence of the light it anointed that he believed what an anointing and he was commissioned and i have some more belief but i think we'll just stop there if you go back in and uh i'll just let me read this one more paragraph here paragraph 65 that's what the world needs today that's what the church needs today that's what everyone needs that son and daughter of god in order to be that you need a personal contact say something no matter you know the word is true you know what's right but then when it contacts and then you see the things done then you know you're on the right road and watch it always will be spiritual it stands right with the scriptures because this did if you get a chance go back and and read it but we're maturing we're coming into perfection the world is part of our perfection it's part of our test it's part of our trying but we can't lose focus on the great individual reality that we each need contact with god not one contact we need a life of contact because the enemy is like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour he there was two hundred thousand thousand demons loosed at the river euphrates upon the bride those spirits went out to work on musicians artists film makers music directors politicians talk show hosts educators coaches every place of influence promoting their kingdom but we're not just survivors we're conquerors when we find our purpose we become a mighty army an army is here to fight and what we're here to fight for is we're here to fight to get every single one of our kinsmen back no matter where they are how deep and troubled they are how bad and sin they are how lost they are how mentally disturbed they are we've got a purpose go into all the world and preach the gospel ye are my witnesses that i can do through you exceedingly and abundantly even above what you can ask or think i'll be with you even in you till the end when you read why christ speak you see the great god and how that he was developed and and and how that he come forth and and you can go back and read it and there's so many lessons in there but i like this one statement here and i'm not going to read this statement but i'm going to see what brother branham said here and this was in paragraph 71 and 72 but he said moses knew that he was born for that purpose and looked out the window and watched the hebrews as they toiled and looked back here in the scriptures and said and they shall so journey for four hundred years and i'll bring them out with a mighty hand and then when he come back after a commission anointed that he knew he was born and his faith looked and his faith looked by faith he saw those people and knew they were children of god because the world and the word said so they wasn't of the world and wasn't like the rest of them they were different they were cranks and fanatics to the high glamorous of egypt and he was to be the son of pharaoh taking the kingdom over next but he there was something down in him a real faith that looked not at those things the glamour that he was to inherit he looked to the promise of god and knew that the time was drawing nigh and what that man must have thought of i want to talk to him with him someday when i meet him on the other side you say crazy brother no it isn't i'm going to meet him by the grace of god yes sir and i'll talk to him someday moses himself and how i would like to ask him just now when he seen his preparation think of it when he's seen his preparation when i i look back i never seen my testimony the way i saw it after this when he's seen his preparation all you've been through everything was just god preparing me he said i want to talk to moses when he's seen his preparation amen i believe god's preparing the bride i believe he's preparing us for a rapture i believe there's a maturity and a perfection going on i believe one day we're going to recognize our preparation and we're going to speak and go forward god bless you [Applause] stand [Music] fall just like the rain [Music] on me oh [Music] me [Music] oh oh [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] this me oh [Music]

father lord we fill you in our presence this morning lord as brother david said you've rode out each of our lives lord some of us maybe would want to rewrite the way that we were born or the way that we were raised lord maybe through divorced or broken homes or those that dropped out of schools or those that have loved ones passed away or there's many things in our life father that we might want to be different lord but it was spoken this morning that each thing was planned out lord that it would give you glory sometimes in the flesh we don't see those things sometimes we wonder why we've gone down a certain path and we want to rewrite our mistakes lord but that's what you let the blood be there for lord and we plead the blood lord we ask for forgiveness for the ways that we were sure with people and the ways that lord we cut corners and we did things that weren't right lord we can sit there under a condemnation and guilt lord but that will never get us anywhere father so we just put ourselves under your blood lord we want to find your purpose for our life lord we don't want to always be having a pity party and crying lord in our mistakes and our failures and the things that would just keep us down lord we want to speak your word we want to speak the truth you thought so much of us lord that you sent a prophet in this last day that would speak your mind and let us know how much you love us lord we want to be under that cloud of love and that cloud of expectation of what you had for us lord we thank you for all your goodness lord even the things that when we're challenged and the things that we feel like are not going our way lord we know that you have a purpose lord there's times that you're trying to build character in us there's trying to there's things that you're trying to instill in us lord that are your traits and your attributes that you want to pull out or that this world can see father we want to be willing we just turn ourselves over to you lord we ask that you would give brother david strength lord for laboring this morning or do you know the situations in the church and the things in our hearts lord we commit them to you lord we ask you brother matthew lord as he prepares his hearts for the evening service lord may we come back expecting to hear from you again we love you we ask these things in jesus name amen also one last thing just from a deacon perspective we should have plenty of parking now so uh we'll try to keep you updated as things change but at the moment the way that things are leveled out there i think everybody should be able to park here feel free also if you would want to give up a spot to some of the elders and those with family on the concrete parking but we should have plenty at this moment we'll let you know what the next steps [Music] god are you all man don't forget to drink a lot of water it's hot out there and we'll see tonight god bless you i am redeemed i am ready [Music] [Music] i get
