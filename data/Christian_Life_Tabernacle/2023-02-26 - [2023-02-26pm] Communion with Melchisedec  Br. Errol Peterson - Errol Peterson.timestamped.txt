[41:38] she she didn't know what to tell me but
[41:41] she tried her best to tell me that what

[42:00] before the the end of the church I have
[42:02] to go and see the preacher so that it
[42:05] will pray for me
[42:07] and then I came when I came it was about
[42:10] a nephew
[42:11] who was speaking who was preaching to
[42:14] speak
[42:16] uh

[43:16] and then
[43:18] he starts preaching you say even if you
[43:20] went to the doctor right now and you
[43:22] have x-ray no X-ray and then the doctor
[43:26] says something don't believe that just
[43:28] forget about it it's your turn

[1:07:56] come and bless us tonight as we linger
[1:07:58] in your presence in Jesus name we pray
[1:08:01] amen amen while we are standing let us
[1:08:04] turn to our Bibles for scripture reading
[1:08:05] we'll turn to the Book of Genesis
[1:08:07] chapter 14.
[1:08:09] and we'll read from verses 14 to 20.
[1:08:12] and then Matthew chapter 26
[1:08:15] verses 26 to 30. and then in Hebrews
[1:08:18] chapter 7
[1:08:20] verses 1 to 2.
[1:08:24] our first reading would be from Genesis
[1:08:26] chapter 14. verses 14 to 20.
[1:08:32] and when Abraham heard that his brother
[1:08:34] was taken captive
[1:08:36] he armed these trained servants born in
[1:08:40] his own house
[1:08:43] 318 and pursued them unto Dan
[1:08:46] and he divided himself against him he
[1:08:49] and his servants by night and smote them
[1:08:52] and pursued them unto hoba which is in
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] on the left hand of Damascus and he
[1:09:00] brought back all goods and also brought
[1:09:04] again his brother lot and his goods and
[1:09:07] the women also and the people
[1:09:10] and the king of Sodom went out to meet
[1:09:13] him after his return from the slaughter
[1:09:15] of cheryloma and of the kings that were
[1:09:19] with him at the valley of Sheva which is
[1:09:23] the King's Dale and Melchizedek king of
[1:09:27] Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and
[1:09:31] he was the priest of the most high God
[1:09:33] and he blessed him and said Blessed Be
[1:09:36] Abram of the most high god possessor of
[1:09:40] Heaven and Earth and he blessed and
[1:09:43] blessed be the most high God which hath
[1:09:46] delivered thine enemies into thy hand
[1:09:49] and he gave him tithes of all
[1:09:53] Genesis and now Matthew chapter 24 26 I
[1:09:57] mean
[1:09:58] verses 26 to 30.
[1:10:08] and as they were eating Jesus took his
[1:10:12] bread and blessed it and break it and
[1:10:15] gave it to his disciples and said take
[1:10:18] it this is my body
[1:10:21] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[1:10:24] gave it to them saying drink ye all of
[1:10:27] it for this is my blood of the new
[1:10:30] testament which is shared for many for
[1:10:34] the remission of sins
[1:10:36] but I say unto you I will not drink his
[1:10:40] forth of his of this fruit of the vine
[1:10:43] until the day when I drink it Anew with
[1:10:46] you in my father's Kingdom and when they
[1:10:49] are sung
[1:10:50] and him they went out into the Mount of
[1:10:55] Olives and in our final scripture in
[1:10:57] Hebrews chapter 7 verses 1 to 2
[1:11:01] for this melchized the king of Salem
[1:11:05] Priests of the most high God whom it
[1:11:08] Abram returning from the slaughter of
[1:11:10] the Kings and blessed him
[1:11:13] to also Abraham gave a tithe a tenth
[1:11:17] part of all first being by
[1:11:20] interpretation king of righteousness and
[1:11:22] after that king of Salem which is king
[1:11:26] of Peace may the Lord add His blessings
[1:11:29] the reading of his word you may be
[1:11:30] seated
[1:11:33] so tonight
[1:11:35] we would like to Fellowship around this
[1:11:37] inspiration
[1:11:39] on communing with Melchizedek
[1:11:43] communing with Melchizedek
[1:11:46] now we find according to our scripture
[1:11:48] reading that lot went down to Sodom and
[1:11:51] Gomorrah
[1:11:53] and the Gentile kings came to Sodom and
[1:11:57] they declared war
[1:11:58] and they took lot and his family captive
[1:12:02] and the Bible says that lot was a
[1:12:04] brother to Abraham
[1:12:06] and when Abram heard that his brother
[1:12:09] had been taken captive
[1:12:12] we find that he went after a fallen
[1:12:15] brother
[1:12:17] now as you all know that what brother
[1:12:20] Branham says about Adam and then Abraham
[1:12:25] Adam could not keep the Covenant of God
[1:12:28] so God started off a New Covenant with
[1:12:31] Abraham
[1:12:33] and yet we find in the Book of Genesis
[1:12:36] we find a mystery
[1:12:39] being made known
[1:12:42] of what the Bible was all about
[1:12:46] the Bible Abraham calls it the seven
[1:12:48] seal book of redemption
[1:12:51] the whole Bible is about Redemption and
[1:12:54] Redemption means bringing it back to its
[1:12:57] former condition
[1:12:59] and here we find in this little story in
[1:13:01] the Bible anybody can read it with loud
[1:13:05] real just thinking well it's another
[1:13:06] story
[1:13:07] but we thank God for a prophet in our
[1:13:09] day
[1:13:10] he could see further than what the
[1:13:13] letters were printed in the Bible
[1:13:15] he said here that Abram was absolutely
[1:13:18] doing the work of Redeemer by going
[1:13:22] after his Fallen brother
[1:13:25] and yet we find there was lot
[1:13:28] it was is his brother the Bible says and
[1:13:32] Abram he armed himself
[1:13:35] with his servants
[1:13:37] see they were born in his house they
[1:13:39] were faithful and they were the ones who
[1:13:42] were circumcised
[1:13:44] now circumcision being a type of the
[1:13:46] Holy Ghost
[1:13:48] and they were all included in the same
[1:13:51] Covenant
[1:13:52] and we find that the whole scripture
[1:13:54] deals with this Covenant which God made
[1:13:58] with Abraham
[1:13:59] in the Book of Genesis even the faith
[1:14:03] that Abram had but Abraham says his
[1:14:06] faith was the for the coming of Jesus
[1:14:09] and that Faith was a faith unite spirit
[1:14:12] and flesh together
[1:14:15] and that's the only true faith that God
[1:14:19] recognizes upon the Earth
[1:14:22] that's why Jesus said when I when he
[1:14:26] returns again will I find faith
[1:14:29] so brother Branham says yes Malachi 4.
[1:14:32] the faith of the fathers will be
[1:14:34] restored again
[1:14:36] amen the heart of the children will
[1:14:37] return to the faith of the fathers and
[1:14:40] that Faith started when the hello gods
[1:14:43] or the power of fire came into the body
[1:14:46] of Jesus
[1:14:49] and from Jesus he Sanctified the 120 who
[1:14:53] went to the upper room
[1:14:54] and on their Pentecost that polaro fire
[1:14:57] came and he divided himself up
[1:15:00] amongst those hundred and twenty
[1:15:03] and brother Branham says that for 2000
[1:15:07] years
[1:15:07] the Holy Ghost was bound
[1:15:10] we never saw the pillar of fire again
[1:15:12] but yet the end time the pillar of fire
[1:15:15] returns back again
[1:15:17] at the time when there has to be a
[1:15:19] restoration back to the faith of the
[1:15:21] fathers so they could not be of
[1:15:24] restoration until the pillar of fire
[1:15:26] returns again to the Church of the
[1:15:28] Living God
[1:15:30] so there's a mystery behind all these
[1:15:33] things that was happening
[1:15:36] and the brother Brian says the messenger
[1:15:38] of Malachi 4 must do two things
[1:15:41] he must reveal the mystery of the seven
[1:15:44] Thunders and turn the hearts of the
[1:15:46] children to the faith of the fathers and
[1:15:49] he says these divinely revealed truths
[1:15:52] will literally turn the heart of the
[1:15:55] children to the faith of the fathers
[1:15:59] amen and yet we find the story unfolding
[1:16:04] in the Book of Genesis
[1:16:07] and the scripture says that
[1:16:09] Abraham pursued the enemy until then and
[1:16:14] he smote them
[1:16:15] then to Damascus then he slew them
[1:16:18] brought them blown back all that was
[1:16:21] lost
[1:16:23] and that's what Jesus done he went to
[1:16:25] Calvary he paid the price of redemption
[1:16:28] to bring back all that was lost to bring
[1:16:32] us back to our former estate again we
[1:16:36] are going back to Eden Hallelujah
[1:16:40] so we find that it was a picture or a
[1:16:44] story of redemption but Abraham says
[1:16:47] it's the seven sealed book of redemption
[1:16:51] and we find that Christ pursued the
[1:16:53] enemy to the end until he brought back
[1:16:56] everything that was lost
[1:16:59] amen as I were the opening of the seals
[1:17:01] we find the Redemption of the Bride his
[1:17:04] wife those first four horse riders then
[1:17:07] the fifth was the Jews the sixth the
[1:17:10] Redemption of the earth and the seventh
[1:17:12] they were silence
[1:17:15] he says nothing about the seven
[1:17:17] but as we all know that was the coming
[1:17:19] of the Lord that was the appearing of
[1:17:21] the logos yet at the end time Revelation
[1:17:24] 10 he says was your seventh seal
[1:17:28] so we are living in Bible times great
[1:17:31] Supernatural things has happened in our
[1:17:33] day what a wonderful day we are living
[1:17:36] in the songwriter says there's never
[1:17:38] been a day like this day there's never
[1:17:40] been a light that shines so bright as
[1:17:42] his glorious light of the hour we are
[1:17:45] children of the light we are walking in
[1:17:48] the light of God Amen so we find that
[1:17:51] this was a great mystery
[1:17:54] that was unfolding itself in Genesis
[1:17:57] and here was Lot Abram's brother he was
[1:18:02] a relative to Abram
[1:18:04] his own relative
[1:18:07] they had the same grandfather
[1:18:10] so we find Redemption is all about the
[1:18:14] family of God
[1:18:16] those that are a part of him
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:21] so there was a blood tie between Abram
[1:18:26] and that feeling was that he could not
[1:18:29] lose his Fallen brother
[1:18:32] his brother had gone astray
[1:18:36] the brother of God said he was taken
[1:18:37] away by the enemy
[1:18:39] and he went to rescue a fallen brother
[1:18:43] and that's when we go out and we give
[1:18:46] witness of the message of the hour we
[1:18:49] are not looking for church members we
[1:18:51] are looking for fallen brothers that are
[1:18:54] part of the Covenant they are included
[1:18:56] in the Covenant which God made with
[1:18:58] Abram
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:01] that's why it's a Grace Covenant
[1:19:04] Abram I have already done it
[1:19:06] go before me and be thou perfect Abrams
[1:19:10] God told Adam if you do this I'll do
[1:19:13] that if you do this I'll do that but
[1:19:15] with Abram it was Grace Grace that's how
[1:19:19] when the Capstone comes down at the end
[1:19:21] time it comes with shoutings of Grace
[1:19:23] Grace not by power not by might but by
[1:19:28] my spirit saith the Lord
[1:19:31] so we find a picture brother Branham
[1:19:33] says of the true church
[1:19:36] they're going after a fallen brother
[1:19:40] they are going after the brother that's
[1:19:43] of the same bloodline
[1:19:46] see we find the prophet says a picture
[1:19:49] of the two churches that is blessed of
[1:19:52] God
[1:19:53] that as the promise of God here at the
[1:19:57] end time
[1:19:58] they have a covenant with God
[1:20:01] that's why when he comes in Revelation
[1:20:02] 10 he comes as the angel of the Covenant
[1:20:06] he comes as a covenant Angel he comes
[1:20:10] with a rainbow around his head and his
[1:20:13] feet as well as a fire so he's coming
[1:20:15] for a covenant people
[1:20:18] he's coming for the Royal seed of Abram
[1:20:21] that's whatever happened in the life of
[1:20:24] Abram in the Book of Genesis that same
[1:20:26] thing is to repeat again at the end time
[1:20:29] Abram was visited by Melchizedek so the
[1:20:33] Royal seed will be visited Again by
[1:20:36] Melchizedek
[1:20:38] Hallelujah just before the coming of the
[1:20:41] Sun
[1:20:42] Hallelujah and that change is in
[1:20:44] progress
[1:20:45] as we
[1:20:47] preach the other night
[1:20:48] there's a change since the promise has
[1:20:50] been made he's changing us amen we are
[1:20:54] getting away from the world but we are
[1:20:56] growing closer to him we are being more
[1:20:59] transformed into the image of the
[1:21:02] Heavenly he says don't pattern after
[1:21:04] Hollywood you must pattern after heaven
[1:21:09] we are reflecting that Vision which the
[1:21:12] prophet saw of the Bride yeah he saw the
[1:21:15] bride in preview
[1:21:17] amen you saw the first bride and she was
[1:21:20] walking in tune of the word of God
[1:21:23] and then he saw the American bride
[1:21:25] he said he made it made him sick after
[1:21:28] all the meetings and the manifestations
[1:21:30] of the spirit and this is what that
[1:21:32] message could produce but then the
[1:21:34] voices the bride will come into preview
[1:21:37] again and she walked exactly as the
[1:21:40] first bride Hallelujah she was properly
[1:21:43] dressed the prophet explains in that
[1:21:46] preview how that bride looked so if we
[1:21:49] look any different to the one that
[1:21:51] appeared in the vision that we are not
[1:21:53] in the bride we must pattern after that
[1:21:57] Vision because then we are part of the
[1:21:59] vision that the prophet saw in preview
[1:22:02] Hallelujah so we find that
[1:22:05] this church has a covenant with God
[1:22:09] Hallelujah and has faith in this
[1:22:12] Covenant
[1:22:13] the prophecy is the holy spirit leads
[1:22:15] them that is born in the same household
[1:22:19] of the Holy Ghost where Christ was born
[1:22:24] to pursue after the wayward the
[1:22:28] backslidden slaying every devil that has
[1:22:32] overcome them Hallelujah overcoming sin
[1:22:35] speaking to the people about their lusts
[1:22:38] and the things that they are doing
[1:22:39] preaching to them the true gospel we
[1:22:43] have the true gospel brothers and
[1:22:45] sisters we I don't think we realize what
[1:22:47] we have amen this is a message direct
[1:22:49] from the Throne of God God came to visit
[1:22:52] us here at the end time Hallelujah so we
[1:22:56] find that
[1:22:57] uh Abram wanted to bring them back into
[1:23:01] full fellowship with God again
[1:23:04] that's why when you come into the
[1:23:06] message you are coming into full
[1:23:08] fellowship with God again
[1:23:11] that's how I felt the first time I came
[1:23:13] to the message it was something totally
[1:23:15] different to what we had in denomination
[1:23:18] here we experienced the reality of God
[1:23:22] here the word becomes a reality unto us
[1:23:24] yeah everything has changed the way you
[1:23:28] speak the way you conduct yourself the
[1:23:30] way you do business this is something
[1:23:33] totally unique in itself something
[1:23:36] different to what the world has out
[1:23:38] there because we find we listen to the
[1:23:40] gospel out there it's just philosophy
[1:23:42] and psychology and that's all that they
[1:23:45] are teaching the people you know how uh
[1:23:47] this happened to me and how that you've
[1:23:50] got to do this and that to the other but
[1:23:52] when you come to the message of the hour
[1:23:54] it's just solid wood
[1:23:57] it tells you exactly who you are where
[1:24:00] you come from and where you are going to
[1:24:02] Hallelujah the promise is why
[1:24:05] because they are Covenant Brothers
[1:24:09] not just members but we are looking for
[1:24:12] Covenant Brothers
[1:24:14] we are looking for blood relations we
[1:24:17] have the same father we come from the
[1:24:21] same source
[1:24:22] Hallelujah he says in the message in the
[1:24:26] book of Hebrews
[1:24:27] we are in a battle now
[1:24:30] we are after our fallen brother
[1:24:35] that God before the foundation of the
[1:24:38] world saw
[1:24:40] and predestinated unto
[1:24:43] eternal life
[1:24:45] see
[1:24:46] and the things of the world got him
[1:24:49] caught up in a whirlwind
[1:24:51] he's out into the societies and classes
[1:24:55] him and his wife walking up and down the
[1:24:59] streets smoking and drinking and
[1:25:01] carousing trying to find peace
[1:25:04] and the spirit of Christ in us as it
[1:25:08] would be in Abraham we are going after
[1:25:12] him
[1:25:14] we must bring him in why he's a fallen
[1:25:17] brother
[1:25:18] see with all the armors of God the
[1:25:22] angels of God encamped about we have
[1:25:25] gone to bring back our fallen brother
[1:25:29] Hallelujah so we're not even praying
[1:25:31] Church
[1:25:32] we are this is a fellowship of all
[1:25:35] brothers and sisters together in Christ
[1:25:37] amen but as it unfolds we'll see what is
[1:25:41] absolutely taking place at the end time
[1:25:45] so we find that despite what lot did to
[1:25:48] Abram
[1:25:49] there was a bond between the two of them
[1:25:52] when his brother Bachelor and gone
[1:25:54] astray the holy spirit is still called
[1:25:57] for that person Hallelujah because he is
[1:26:01] a brother
[1:26:02] so we find that since the fall
[1:26:06] down Through the Ages
[1:26:10] it was the spirit of Christ going after
[1:26:13] Fallen Brothers
[1:26:20] and we find that in a battle like Abram
[1:26:22] did to bring back Brothers
[1:26:26] those whose names were written in the
[1:26:29] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:26:31] back to the household of faith
[1:26:34] so when Abram returned in Victory
[1:26:38] Melchizedek met him
[1:26:41] showing the brothers and sisters at the
[1:26:43] consummation
[1:26:45] when the battle is over
[1:26:47] when it's time for the lost brother to
[1:26:51] come in
[1:26:53] the Royal seat of Abram will meet
[1:26:56] Melchizedek again
[1:26:58] that's why the prophet preached a
[1:27:00] message who is this Melchizedek
[1:27:03] he has no mother no father no beginning
[1:27:06] of days no ending of life
[1:27:08] it says that he's the same yesterday
[1:27:10] today and forever what was he showing us
[1:27:14] Melchizedek has come
[1:27:16] it is about the time for the promised
[1:27:19] son to appear on the scene Hallelujah
[1:27:22] you see there's an appearing of the of
[1:27:24] the Lord and is the coming of the Lord
[1:27:26] the appearing is the spirit coming
[1:27:29] but the coming of the Lord itself is
[1:27:31] when we meet him in the air amen as the
[1:27:34] physical person but now we've seen the
[1:27:37] appearing of the Lord so we find when
[1:27:41] Melchizedek met him
[1:27:45] he never offered him money
[1:27:48] he offered him Bread and Wine
[1:27:52] so there must be a spiritual meaning
[1:27:55] associated with this offering which
[1:27:59] Melchizedek gave to Abram
[1:28:02] so let us look
[1:28:05] at Melchizedek
[1:28:08] and we'll find out that his titles
[1:28:11] unfolds the different stages
[1:28:14] of redemption
[1:28:16] in his titles
[1:28:19] you find out that he was a priest of the
[1:28:22] most high God
[1:28:25] tomb Abram paid tithes
[1:28:28] and he blessed Abraham
[1:28:31] now Melchizedek was none other
[1:28:35] than the incarnated Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:41] and as a type
[1:28:42] he gave Abraham communion
[1:28:46] that was the first time the communion
[1:28:48] was ever served on the Earth
[1:28:51] he gave communion to the one who was in
[1:28:55] a covenant with him
[1:28:58] so we find that communion is not just
[1:29:02] for everybody
[1:29:03] who feels like taking communion
[1:29:07] it is for the believer who's in a
[1:29:10] covenant with Melchizedek
[1:29:15] because in Genesis chapter 17 verse 7.
[1:29:19] God told Abraham
[1:29:21] and I will establish my Covenant
[1:29:25] between me and thee
[1:29:28] and thy seed after thee in their
[1:29:32] Generations
[1:29:34] so God is interested only in one lineage
[1:29:37] and that's of the seed of Abram
[1:29:41] so in this generation
[1:29:43] there's going to be a call again for the
[1:29:45] seed of Abram
[1:29:48] and is only one group of people
[1:29:51] who saw the sign of Melchizedek that
[1:29:53] Abram saw in Genesis 18 where his back
[1:29:56] turned to the congregation
[1:29:58] and then he said and he told Sarah what
[1:30:01] she was thinking in the tent behind him
[1:30:04] whom was he addressing it to the seed of
[1:30:07] Abram
[1:30:09] in our case it's the Royal seat of Abram
[1:30:12] when we get the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:14] Ghost
[1:30:15] see so this message is designated to a
[1:30:19] specific group of people
[1:30:23] and this is what he says further
[1:30:26] in their generations for an Everlasting
[1:30:28] Covenant
[1:30:30] to be a god unto thee
[1:30:33] and to thy seed after thee
[1:30:36] so he promised to be Only a God to Abram
[1:30:40] and to recede and to them after him
[1:30:43] as we heard this morning about the
[1:30:45] worship and all you know if you are not
[1:30:48] part of the seed of Abram is all in vain
[1:30:51] and how do I identify yourself as being
[1:30:54] a part of the seed of Abram by
[1:30:56] recognizing your day
[1:30:58] and its message
[1:31:01] to see what God is doing in your day
[1:31:04] all those who are part of the Covenant
[1:31:06] they will respond to the message of the
[1:31:09] hour
[1:31:10] it's designated to a specific class of
[1:31:14] people
[1:31:15] so tonight we can say Amazing Grace How
[1:31:18] Sweet the Sound
[1:31:20] that saved a Wretch like Me I was blind
[1:31:22] but now I can see by the Sovereign Grace
[1:31:25] of almighty God
[1:31:27] amen he says yeah and I will give unto
[1:31:31] thee now I want you to remember these
[1:31:32] words to be a god
[1:31:34] unto thee and to thy seed after thee
[1:31:40] verse 8 and I will give unto thee and to
[1:31:43] thy seed after thee the land wherein
[1:31:46] thou art a stranger
[1:31:48] now to Abram it was a natural land but
[1:31:51] to us it's a spiritual land and that
[1:31:54] land is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] the land of promise
[1:31:58] and all the land of cadence for an
[1:32:00] everlasting possession and I will be
[1:32:04] their God
[1:32:07] verse 9. and God said unto Abram Thou
[1:32:10] shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou
[1:32:13] and thy seed after thee in their
[1:32:17] Generations
[1:32:19] God is unchanging it shows the Infinity
[1:32:23] of God
[1:32:24] you know how many people they are on the
[1:32:26] earth tonight billions of people
[1:32:29] but he knows what each and everyone is
[1:32:32] thinking
[1:32:33] just to give you an idea
[1:32:35] of the great God that we serve knows
[1:32:38] what you are thinking he knows your holy
[1:32:39] history he knows your future he knows
[1:32:42] everything
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:46] in verse 10 this is my Covenant which he
[1:32:49] shall keep between me and you and thy
[1:32:52] seed after thee every man shall among
[1:32:55] you shall be circumcised which is a type
[1:32:59] of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:01] so do we a royal seat of Abram we must
[1:33:04] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:07] without the Holy Ghost we are not
[1:33:09] counted as part of the sea that's why
[1:33:12] Peter said repent
[1:33:13] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:33:15] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:33:18] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:21] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:33:23] children to them that are far of even as
[1:33:26] many as the Lord Our God shall cope
[1:33:30] amen not him that willeth
[1:33:33] but it's God that share with Mercy
[1:33:36] so God gave Abram communion as a shadow
[1:33:41] that when he becomes flesh he would be
[1:33:44] cut in parts
[1:33:47] and communion would be given as a
[1:33:49] further symbol of his body
[1:33:52] and a further revelation of himself
[1:33:56] as we all know at our communion table we
[1:33:58] have wine symbolizing his blood
[1:34:02] which is the life of the spirit
[1:34:05] and the bread itself symbolizing
[1:34:08] the body
[1:34:10] and he said at the last communion he
[1:34:13] says do this in the remembrance of me
[1:34:18] see so his body was resurrected
[1:34:21] and ascended on high
[1:34:24] but he sent back the spirit
[1:34:26] to seal every Covenant brother
[1:34:31] into his spiritual body upon the Earth
[1:34:35] who are of the same order
[1:34:38] with no beginning of days or ending of
[1:34:41] life
[1:34:43] so you had you existed in God's mind
[1:34:47] before there was a star a molecule or a
[1:34:51] atom you were right there already
[1:34:54] God knew the hour that you would come
[1:34:57] and the Very thought that God had of you
[1:34:59] he presented that thought to you in a
[1:35:01] word
[1:35:02] and the word comes to the prophet and it
[1:35:06] was a prophet the message that Drew is
[1:35:08] like a magnet into the household of
[1:35:12] faith
[1:35:13] amen so if it is not by chance that
[1:35:16] you're here tonight it's not by chance
[1:35:18] that you accepted the message of the
[1:35:21] hour you in God's mind before the
[1:35:24] foundation of the world
[1:35:26] Hallelujah
[1:35:28] see
[1:35:30] so we find it's to those who are of the
[1:35:32] same order
[1:35:34] and when we receive the spirit we are
[1:35:36] baptized into the fellowship with
[1:35:40] Melchizedek
[1:35:42] we become a part of him
[1:35:45] the Bible says we are by one Spirit we
[1:35:49] are all baptized into one body
[1:35:53] and brother Branham says the alchizedek
[1:35:55] became Jesus
[1:35:58] now we want to see what he says when he
[1:36:02] became flesh
[1:36:05] John chapter 5 and verse 53.
[1:36:09] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:36:11] I say unto you
[1:36:13] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:36:17] man
[1:36:18] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:36:21] you
[1:36:23] you said some people they don't take
[1:36:24] communion
[1:36:25] you are absolutely openly declaring to
[1:36:28] everybody I'm not a part of him
[1:36:31] I'm not a part of Melchizedek
[1:36:34] but you partaking of the communion
[1:36:37] you are absolutely giving Witness
[1:36:39] that you have life within you
[1:36:42] that you are a part of the mystical body
[1:36:45] of Jesus Christ
[1:36:48] see he says whosoever eatth my flesh
[1:36:52] and drinketh my blood hath
[1:36:56] eternal life
[1:36:58] and I will raise him up at the last day
[1:37:01] for my flesh is meet indeed
[1:37:05] and my blood is drink indeed
[1:37:09] he that easeth my flesh and drink with
[1:37:12] my blood dwelleth in me and I in him
[1:37:19] part of him
[1:37:21] as the living father has sent me and I
[1:37:24] live by the father
[1:37:26] so he that either me even he shall live
[1:37:31] by me
[1:37:34] so it's a close-knit family
[1:37:36] the family of God
[1:37:39] I love the family of God
[1:37:41] United all together as one that's why
[1:37:44] there's a kindred spirit it's a spirit
[1:37:47] of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:49] see and they couldn't really understand
[1:37:51] what Jesus was saying
[1:37:54] he was he was absolutely telling them
[1:37:58] or speaking of the believer partaking of
[1:38:01] his being
[1:38:03] see but we find later Paul came around
[1:38:07] said it was the New Covenant in his
[1:38:11] blood
[1:38:11] we must partake of him to be identified
[1:38:15] in the New Covenant
[1:38:19] and we must do it
[1:38:21] in remembrance of him
[1:38:24] and so we take communion we remember him
[1:38:27] the price he paid for our Redemption
[1:38:29] upon the cross of calvary
[1:38:32] the most cruelest death that any man
[1:38:34] could die of
[1:38:35] he had to follow that route to declare
[1:38:38] his love for you
[1:38:40] amen
[1:38:42] we are in a covenant with him
[1:38:46] by sacrifice
[1:38:48] and we find here in Psalms 50. verses 1
[1:38:53] to 6.
[1:38:54] David is giving a preview of the opening
[1:38:58] of the seventh seal
[1:39:00] other brand says the Seven Seas is risen
[1:39:02] all over the Bible
[1:39:04] see there was silence in heaven for the
[1:39:07] space of half hour
[1:39:10] but the activity was no longer in heaven
[1:39:12] because as long as he's in heaven
[1:39:14] those seraphims they cried day and night
[1:39:16] holy holy holy unto the law
[1:39:19] holy holy holy unto the Lord but if he's
[1:39:23] not there
[1:39:25] there's nothing to worship anymore
[1:39:27] and they were all in silence
[1:39:30] and we find him in Revelations 10 one I
[1:39:33] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:39:35] heaven and brother Branham says that was
[1:39:38] the seventh seal
[1:39:40] the seventh seal which brought him down
[1:39:44] amen and the scripture says I saw
[1:39:47] another Mighty Angel come down let's
[1:39:49] read psalms 50.
[1:39:51] from verse 1.
[1:39:53] the psalm of Assaf
[1:39:56] the Mighty God even the Lord had spoken
[1:40:00] and called the Earth from the rising of
[1:40:03] the Sun
[1:40:04] that was from Genesis
[1:40:07] unto the going down thereof that's in
[1:40:10] the Book of Revelation
[1:40:11] is amen he went to Sunset Mountain it
[1:40:15] was the setting Sun but it was also the
[1:40:18] dawning of a brand new day rise Shine
[1:40:21] for thy light has come
[1:40:23] this was now introducing a new day this
[1:40:26] was the bride's day the Gathering of the
[1:40:29] Bride together
[1:40:31] in first two out of Zion the Perfection
[1:40:34] of beauty God hath shine
[1:40:37] Our God shall come
[1:40:40] he's speaking about the coming of the
[1:40:41] Lord
[1:40:42] and shall not keep silence
[1:40:46] there'll be a Breaking of Silence when
[1:40:48] our God comes
[1:40:50] because the activity is no longer in
[1:40:52] heaven it's now on Earth
[1:40:56] a fire shall devour before him and it
[1:40:58] shall be very Tempest you will surround
[1:41:00] about him
[1:41:01] he shall call to the heavens from above
[1:41:06] and to the Earth that he may judge his
[1:41:09] people he comes as judge with the wig
[1:41:14] amen
[1:41:15] gather my Saints together unto me so
[1:41:19] it's coming both as judge
[1:41:21] at the same time Gathering they elect
[1:41:24] together
[1:41:25] the Saints by the same message
[1:41:28] those that made a covenant with me
[1:41:33] is the word covenant again
[1:41:35] by sacrifice
[1:41:37] in other words those whose names that
[1:41:39] were written in the land's Book of Life
[1:41:41] Is Coming only for those
[1:41:43] whose names that were written both Jew
[1:41:46] and Gentile
[1:41:48] if your name is the last book of life
[1:41:50] you're going to see the light of your
[1:41:51] hour
[1:41:52] but he was not there the Bible says in
[1:41:54] Revelation and the Beast that's to come
[1:41:57] on the earth will deceive all those
[1:41:59] whose names that were not written in the
[1:42:03] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:42:05] see so he speaks here about the Covenant
[1:42:08] and here comes as a covenant angel
[1:42:10] with me by sacrifice
[1:42:13] and the heaven shall declare his
[1:42:16] righteousness for God is Judge himself
[1:42:23] so we find that through him we are
[1:42:26] Justified
[1:42:27] the prophet says you've never done it in
[1:42:29] the first place
[1:42:31] the only way God can see you is the way
[1:42:33] he saw you before the foundation of the
[1:42:36] world
[1:42:37] we never done it in the first place
[1:42:41] we are kept clean as we have an
[1:42:44] intercessor a priest
[1:42:47] amen who intercedes on our behalf
[1:42:52] that's why he was both man and he was
[1:42:55] God
[1:42:57] he got headaches he got let Downs he got
[1:42:59] disappointment the Bible said he was
[1:43:01] despised he was rejected of man a man of
[1:43:05] sorrow and acquainted with grief and we
[1:43:08] heed as it were our faces from him
[1:43:12] he was not we esteemed him not
[1:43:15] you know the man that made the the false
[1:43:18] arm how God says romantic he was esteem
[1:43:21] he's honored for making such a great
[1:43:25] thing but here the god of Heaven came in
[1:43:27] our midst and the Bible says we esteemed
[1:43:30] him not
[1:43:34] amen he's a priest who intercedes on our
[1:43:39] behalf
[1:43:40] the prophet says you're the first word
[1:43:42] in the Bible in the beginning was the
[1:43:44] word and the Word was with God
[1:43:47] and the Word was God now before it could
[1:43:50] be the word it had to be a thought
[1:43:53] it's one thing about the message like
[1:43:54] even before the beginning
[1:43:57] amen takes you back into the mind of God
[1:44:01] even takes you back into the back parts
[1:44:03] of God's mind and he presented here
[1:44:07] for us to understand what Redemption is
[1:44:10] all about
[1:44:12] now before it could be a word it had to
[1:44:14] be a thought because the word is a
[1:44:15] thought expressed
[1:44:17] and when you see that the enemy of this
[1:44:19] world was going to do what he did God
[1:44:23] thought how he would send a great Plan
[1:44:26] of Redemption
[1:44:29] and when he thought it then he spoke it
[1:44:32] and it was as good as done right then
[1:44:35] and thousands of years later came the
[1:44:38] Lord Jesus Christ and died for the sins
[1:44:41] and rose again some 1900 years ago this
[1:44:46] morning for our justification
[1:44:49] sitting at his right hand now
[1:44:52] as a high priest making intercession
[1:44:54] Upon Our confession
[1:44:57] see he became the sacrifice
[1:45:01] he went to Calvary on our behalf
[1:45:05] we should have died we should have
[1:45:06] suffered
[1:45:07] but he took our place he became me that
[1:45:10] I might become him
[1:45:13] he's our intercessor the high priest he
[1:45:17] says in water from the rock oh beloved
[1:45:18] God
[1:45:19] we come to the most humbly father in the
[1:45:22] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:24] to ask first to forgive us of our sins
[1:45:27] and error
[1:45:29] that's our Prophet prayed
[1:45:31] hey he was never you know I don't sell
[1:45:35] in all those things he said I'm a man I
[1:45:37] make mistakes
[1:45:38] he says not everybody will be healed
[1:45:41] when I pray for them
[1:45:45] you know because everybody is not not in
[1:45:48] the position for healing
[1:45:50] they are not in the right condition so
[1:45:52] he says not everybody will be healed
[1:45:54] when I pray for them
[1:45:56] say he was an ordinary man but yet he
[1:45:59] was God's man
[1:46:00] it was God's man for the hour
[1:46:03] entrusted with such a great ministry
[1:46:07] and he says and we are so happy to know
[1:46:10] that we have a high priest sitting in
[1:46:13] glory
[1:46:14] who can be touched with a feeling of our
[1:46:16] infirmity believing this that he climbed
[1:46:19] the ramparts of Glory
[1:46:21] setting way exalted above every Angel
[1:46:24] Archangel Way Beyond the moon and stars
[1:46:27] and hears the prayers of everyone
[1:46:31] that will come humbly asking
[1:46:35] this great telephone connection we have
[1:46:39] as it were
[1:46:40] taking down the receiver calling Central
[1:46:43] Christ Jesus
[1:46:45] asking to be plugged into
[1:46:49] eternity
[1:46:50] and brother and sister there's only one
[1:46:52] class of people
[1:46:53] that can be plugged into eternity
[1:46:56] it's those who come from
[1:46:59] eternity
[1:47:01] after the order of Melchizedek
[1:47:04] and your brother Branham says in the
[1:47:06] message called who is this Melchizedek
[1:47:11] he says now we find him at the beginning
[1:47:13] his attributes
[1:47:15] and now you were with him then
[1:47:20] you shouldn't get we were there with him
[1:47:21] all the time
[1:47:23] then is when the Book of Life comes into
[1:47:26] view
[1:47:27] now we read over here in Revelation
[1:47:28] chapter 13 chapter the eighth verse that
[1:47:31] the Beast that comes upon the Earth in
[1:47:34] these days will deceive all those people
[1:47:37] on the Earth
[1:47:38] whose names were not written in the
[1:47:41] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:47:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:48] he says think of it
[1:47:50] before Jesus was ever born 4 000 years
[1:47:53] before he came to Earth
[1:47:56] and several thousand years before you
[1:47:58] come on Earth
[1:47:59] Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of
[1:48:03] the world
[1:48:05] and the Book of Life was made and your
[1:48:07] name was put on that book of life before
[1:48:10] the foundation of the world
[1:48:13] that's the Bible truth
[1:48:17] your name was ordained of God and placed
[1:48:20] on the book of life before the
[1:48:23] foundation of the world
[1:48:25] that's how when you read the message
[1:48:27] you're absolutely discovering yourself
[1:48:29] so that's where that's that's where I
[1:48:31] come from and that's where I'm heading
[1:48:33] backwards so you can only have eternal
[1:48:35] life if you never had a beginning and
[1:48:38] you never had an ending
[1:48:40] you were there in his attributes you
[1:48:42] don't remember it
[1:48:44] no because you are a part of his life
[1:48:49] you're a part of God when you become a
[1:48:52] son and daughter of God
[1:48:53] just as you're a part of your Earthly
[1:48:56] father
[1:48:57] the male carries the hemoglobin the
[1:49:00] blood
[1:49:01] and when he's gone in the egg when you
[1:49:03] become a part of your father and your
[1:49:05] mother is a part of your father also
[1:49:08] you're all part of your father Glory
[1:49:11] that lets the denomination out all
[1:49:14] together
[1:49:15] God in all the only place
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:21] he says notice now his attribute
[1:49:25] was first God the thought the atom
[1:49:30] itself all in one without being
[1:49:32] expressed then when he expressed
[1:49:34] secondly
[1:49:36] he became the word
[1:49:38] and then the word was made flesh and
[1:49:41] dwelt Among Us
[1:49:42] Saint John the first chapter notice this
[1:49:45] is the beginning
[1:49:47] but before the Eternal notice in the
[1:49:50] beginning was the word when time began
[1:49:53] it was the word
[1:49:55] but before it was word it was an
[1:49:57] attribute
[1:49:58] then it was expressed in the beginning
[1:50:01] was the expression the word now we are
[1:50:04] getting to where Melchizedek is
[1:50:08] see that's the mysterious person
[1:50:11] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:50:13] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:50:15] and when the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:50:18] Among Us hold that there now the prophet
[1:50:21] says his first being was spirit
[1:50:24] God Supernatural
[1:50:27] the great Eternal second he began to
[1:50:30] form himself towards flesh in a
[1:50:33] theophany it's called the word body
[1:50:37] then when the state he was in when he
[1:50:40] met Abraham
[1:50:43] was called Melchizedek he was the form
[1:50:46] of theophany now we'll get to that and
[1:50:49] prove that in a few minutes
[1:50:52] so the reason why he came incarnate
[1:50:56] in human flesh
[1:50:59] was so that he could sanctify a church
[1:51:04] so that he could get into that church
[1:51:08] the main purpose of his coming
[1:51:10] so that he could come in in 12 people
[1:51:13] hallelujah what he says here he says God
[1:51:16] came down and become flesh and died to
[1:51:19] death in Christ so that he could clean
[1:51:22] the church in order to get into it for
[1:51:25] Fellowship
[1:51:27] God loves Fellowship that's what he made
[1:51:30] the man at the beginning for the first
[1:51:32] time for was Fellowship God dwells alone
[1:51:37] with cherubims so God desires your
[1:51:41] fellowship
[1:51:42] so we were ordained by God
[1:51:46] to have communion with him
[1:51:50] because communion is only for the
[1:51:53] household of God
[1:51:56] we can only take communion if we were
[1:52:00] baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:52:02] into his body
[1:52:04] and then we become a part of him
[1:52:08] it's only those who were with him in
[1:52:10] eternity
[1:52:11] that can have
[1:52:13] eternal life
[1:52:14] that's why we find that in Redemption he
[1:52:17] had only one purpose in mind
[1:52:19] and that was for his kingdom subjects
[1:52:24] those who are in a covenant with him by
[1:52:28] sacrifice
[1:52:29] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:52:33] the world
[1:52:34] and you could accomplish Redemption
[1:52:36] because he was the priest of the most
[1:52:40] high God who became the Supreme
[1:52:43] sacrifice for all of his subjects amen
[1:52:48] so we find that after him becoming
[1:52:51] priests
[1:52:52] he made it possible to unfold a further
[1:52:55] part of his purpose
[1:52:57] to become the king of righteousness
[1:53:00] to become the king of this Kingdom
[1:53:03] of his righteous subjects see that's why
[1:53:07] we are not going to make it because of
[1:53:08] our righteousness
[1:53:10] it is because of his righteousness
[1:53:13] he's the king of righteousness that's
[1:53:16] why in the Old Testament they never
[1:53:18] examine examine the worshiper they
[1:53:21] examine the sacrifice if the sacrifice
[1:53:24] was perfect then the worshiper was
[1:53:26] declared perfect
[1:53:28] and we find Revelations 5 no man was
[1:53:30] worthy to take the book or to lose the
[1:53:33] seals thereof and John wept realizing
[1:53:36] that everything would be lost if no one
[1:53:37] come but then the Elder cried don't weep
[1:53:40] John for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:53:43] hath prevailed to take the book and to
[1:53:46] lose the seals thereof
[1:53:48] and when John turned he expecting to see
[1:53:50] a lion he saw a lamb
[1:53:53] a bleeding bloody lamb
[1:53:56] who was worthy to take the book and to
[1:53:59] loose the seals there are so it's the
[1:54:02] worthy one that made us worthy
[1:54:06] Hallelujah so by making his subject
[1:54:09] righteous he unfolds a further part
[1:54:12] of redemption
[1:54:14] he provided himself
[1:54:16] a Dwelling Place
[1:54:18] amen because he's also now king of Salem
[1:54:22] which was later called Jerusalem
[1:54:26] it's the only city on the Earth that God
[1:54:29] that they say is the city of God that
[1:54:31] God identifies himself with Jerusalem is
[1:54:34] the city of God
[1:54:37] and Jerusalem was first a gentile
[1:54:40] possession
[1:54:42] and the New Jerusalem from Heaven is as
[1:54:45] a bride
[1:54:47] a dawned for a husband she becomes the
[1:54:51] holy city
[1:54:52] she becomes the New Jerusalem
[1:54:56] he's Dwelling Place of which he is King
[1:55:01] see this whole Plan of Redemption just
[1:55:03] unfolding and unfolding and unfolding
[1:55:06] all the way from the book of Genesis
[1:55:09] and why can we speak this way it's
[1:55:11] because if God sent us a prophet
[1:55:14] he's opened the eyes of our
[1:55:16] understanding
[1:55:17] to realize who we really are
[1:55:19] amen we're not American we're not South
[1:55:22] African we are children of the kingdom
[1:55:25] of God hallelujah we're from Heaven amen
[1:55:29] in Revelations 21 verse 1 to 3 and 9 to
[1:55:32] 10 it says and I saw a new Heaven and a
[1:55:35] new Earth
[1:55:36] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:55:39] were passed away and there was no mercy
[1:55:42] and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:55:45] Jerusalem
[1:55:47] coming down from God out of Heaven
[1:55:49] prepared as a bride
[1:55:52] adorned for a husband
[1:55:55] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[1:55:58] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:56:02] with men
[1:56:04] so the bride becomes the dwelling place
[1:56:07] of God you know brother Branham says
[1:56:09] that potentially it's already on the
[1:56:11] earth now in the heart of the Saints all
[1:56:15] the attributes Sons and Daughters of God
[1:56:17] amen they have the attributes of all
[1:56:19] those that will be in that City the New
[1:56:21] Jerusalem you are the dwelling place of
[1:56:25] God God's attribute
[1:56:28] is within your soul
[1:56:31] he lives within you
[1:56:33] amen so we knew come to service you'll
[1:56:36] bring God to service but the branches
[1:56:38] God loves to go to church and how can he
[1:56:40] go when you come amen hallelujah
[1:56:45] he says and I heard of words of Heaven
[1:56:47] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:56:49] with men and he will dwell with him and
[1:56:52] they shall be his people
[1:56:54] remember the Covenant is made with Abram
[1:56:56] they shall be his people and God himself
[1:57:00] shall be with him and be their God
[1:57:04] exactly still the same words that he
[1:57:07] used in the Covenant that he made with
[1:57:09] Abraham
[1:57:11] see
[1:57:12] Revelations 21 verse 9. and they came
[1:57:15] unto me one of the Seven Angels which
[1:57:18] had the seven vials full of the seven
[1:57:21] lost plagues and talk with me saying
[1:57:24] come hither I will show Thee the bride
[1:57:27] the Lamb's wife
[1:57:30] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[1:57:33] a great high mountain and showed me that
[1:57:35] great City
[1:57:37] the whole the holy Jerusalem descending
[1:57:41] out of from heaven
[1:57:43] Out of Heaven from God
[1:57:46] so in the Old Testament
[1:57:49] the holiest of holies was his Tabernacle
[1:57:53] when God came and spoke to the children
[1:57:56] of Israel
[1:57:58] it was only a shadow
[1:58:01] of the coming Tabernacle that God was
[1:58:04] going to indwell
[1:58:06] at the coming of Jesus
[1:58:08] he says this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:58:12] am pleased to dwell
[1:58:14] but after he had accomplished Redemption
[1:58:19] in Revelation the bride now becomes a
[1:58:22] tabernacle of his Dwelling Place
[1:58:27] let's read another song
[1:58:29] Psalm 46
[1:58:31] he says to the chief musician for the
[1:58:34] sons of Korah
[1:58:36] a song of element
[1:58:38] God is our refuge and strength
[1:58:42] a very present help in times of trouble
[1:58:46] therefore will not be fear that the
[1:58:48] Earth be removed
[1:58:50] and though the mountains be carried into
[1:58:52] the midst of the sea South almost like
[1:58:54] Los Angeles
[1:58:55] the mountains be carried into the midst
[1:58:57] of the sea
[1:58:59] see
[1:59:02] though the water thereof Roar and be
[1:59:04] troubled
[1:59:06] though the mountains shake with the
[1:59:08] swelling thereof
[1:59:10] but there is a river
[1:59:13] the streams whereof shall make glad the
[1:59:17] city of God who is the city of God
[1:59:20] Jerusalem
[1:59:22] the holy place of the Tabernacles plural
[1:59:25] of the most high
[1:59:28] God is in the midst of her
[1:59:31] her is a church
[1:59:33] her is a woman
[1:59:36] she she shall not be moved God shall
[1:59:41] help her and that's right early
[1:59:45] the Heathen raged the kingdoms were
[1:59:48] moved he uttered his voice the Earth
[1:59:51] melted
[1:59:53] the Lord of hosts is with us
[1:59:57] the god of Jacob is our refuge
[2:00:02] come Behold The Works of the Lord what
[2:00:04] desolations he had made the Earth
[2:00:07] he had maketh was to cease unto the end
[2:00:11] of the Earth
[2:00:13] he breakth the bow and cutth the spear
[2:00:17] in Sunder he burneth the shattered with
[2:00:19] fire
[2:00:20] be still and know that I am God
[2:00:26] I will be exalted among the Heathen who
[2:00:30] are the Heathen the Gentiles
[2:00:33] I will be exalted in the Earth
[2:00:36] the Lord of hosts is with us
[2:00:39] the god of Jacob is our refuge
[2:00:44] he's our hiding place
[2:00:47] the name of the Lord is a might Strong
[2:00:48] Tower the righteous run in and they are
[2:00:52] safe
[2:00:53] in Revelation 21 3 it says and I heard a
[2:00:55] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[2:00:58] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[2:01:00] will dwell with him
[2:01:01] and they shall be his people and God
[2:01:04] himself shall be with him and be their
[2:01:09] God
[2:01:10] according to the Covenant that he made
[2:01:13] with Father Abram
[2:01:15] so the New Jerusalem is his Dwelling
[2:01:18] Place
[2:01:19] and is occupied by his bride so the New
[2:01:22] Jerusalem is a gentile possession he
[2:01:26] takes a bride from the Gentiles for his
[2:01:31] name
[2:01:32] who is a blood relation to him
[2:01:36] he's of the same family
[2:01:38] brother Branham says they come from the
[2:01:41] same source
[2:01:43] like Rebecca was amen she was a blood
[2:01:46] relation to Isaac
[2:01:49] the Bride is a blood relation to Christ
[2:01:53] she's born of his bone Spirit of his
[2:01:55] Spirit life of his life she is him same
[2:02:00] bloodline Hallelujah and his King of the
[2:02:04] New Jerusalem and he says I go to
[2:02:07] prepare a place for you that where I am
[2:02:10] there you may be also he desires our
[2:02:13] fellowship
[2:02:15] that puts another
[2:02:18] might use the word spin on the message
[2:02:20] that we follow
[2:02:21] it's not church
[2:02:23] but it's actually a life
[2:02:25] a daily walk with God a revelation of
[2:02:29] who you are your relationship with the
[2:02:32] one that you are serving you are a part
[2:02:34] of him you are in a covenant
[2:02:38] part of the Covenant that he made with
[2:02:40] Father Abram he hears your prayer he
[2:02:44] promised to be a God to you to Abram and
[2:02:47] his seed after him Hallelujah do you
[2:02:50] love him tonight
[2:02:51] in Revelation 19 16 he says he comes to
[2:02:55] the to the end time as king of kings
[2:02:58] brother Branham says it's a further
[2:03:00] revelation of redemption
[2:03:02] see
[2:03:04] he says
[2:03:05] notice his title king of king of
[2:03:08] righteousness
[2:03:10] king of righteousness king of Peace he
[2:03:12] still Kings now watch
[2:03:14] Hebrews 7 2
[2:03:16] king of righteousness also the king of
[2:03:18] Peace he's two kings there now since he
[2:03:20] has come in flesh
[2:03:23] and received his body up in Revelations
[2:03:26] 21 6 is called the king of kings
[2:03:31] he's all three of them together see
[2:03:35] King God
[2:03:38] who's King God the great logos
[2:03:41] King theophany
[2:03:43] then he becomes king Jesus
[2:03:46] the word the logos in human flesh
[2:03:50] then he becomes king of kings
[2:03:54] amen that's when he takes on flesh so
[2:03:57] now after he Sanctified the church
[2:04:01] the logos now divide itself up into a
[2:04:04] many membered body as a did on the day
[2:04:08] of Pentecost brother Branham says God
[2:04:10] divided himself up and he came in that
[2:04:13] first church and after 2000 years
[2:04:16] returns back
[2:04:18] to Incarnate human bodies again the word
[2:04:22] made flesh again at the end time
[2:04:25] that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:27] is different to what Pentecost
[2:04:30] believes it to be is not a sensation
[2:04:33] is not the evidence being speaking in
[2:04:35] tongues although it will cause you to
[2:04:37] that we haven't
[2:04:38] but it's basically the very person
[2:04:41] the person of Christ now indwelling the
[2:04:44] individual he's very person of his being
[2:04:46] your attribute Express of God
[2:04:50] Hallelujah some of those New Jerusalem
[2:04:53] the theophilicity of God takes on the
[2:04:55] form of his bride he's King theophany
[2:04:58] he's king of all the other king of kings
[2:05:03] potentially that city is on earth now in
[2:05:07] the heart of the Bride but Ibraham says
[2:05:10] we need to recognize this to be Eagle
[2:05:12] food we have heard from our theophany
[2:05:16] and here we finally meets Abram as
[2:05:19] Melchizedek
[2:05:21] a communion which is a type it was a
[2:05:23] prophecy of what he was going to do at
[2:05:26] the end time at the consummation
[2:05:29] amen those who partake of melchized
[2:05:31] their communion are the ones who are
[2:05:34] included in the Covenant they are of the
[2:05:37] household of God
[2:05:40] so correctly speaking it's only those of
[2:05:42] the household of God
[2:05:44] that can take communion
[2:05:47] everybody else can take it but we take
[2:05:49] it with revelation
[2:05:51] we are a part of his being
[2:05:54] amen
[2:05:55] we have the same Lifeline they are the
[2:05:58] hustle of God they are the order of
[2:06:00] Melchizedek so communion is a showdown
[2:06:03] and Judas exposed himself at the
[2:06:06] communion table
[2:06:08] amen it was there that he left the
[2:06:11] service
[2:06:12] amen because he was not part of the
[2:06:15] family
[2:06:16] Hallelujah
[2:06:17] says he gave Abram communion
[2:06:21] after he won the battle
[2:06:24] after he whooped the kings of Camara
[2:06:28] after Abram took up his position
[2:06:32] God gave him a part of himself
[2:06:36] and what did God do adopted him
[2:06:39] God blessed him
[2:06:42] Hallelujah it was 17. uh well Abraham
[2:06:45] says and the king of Solomon went out to
[2:06:47] meet him after his return from the
[2:06:49] slaughter of cheryloma
[2:06:51] and the kings that were with him at the
[2:06:54] valley of shaver which is the King's
[2:06:57] Dale after the battle Abram took up his
[2:07:00] position as in the Kingsdale as a king a
[2:07:06] ruler an overcomer
[2:07:08] Hallelujah and melchized king of Salem
[2:07:12] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[2:07:15] the priest of the most high God and he
[2:07:18] blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of
[2:07:21] the most high god possessor of Heaven
[2:07:24] and Earth
[2:07:26] see
[2:07:27] brother Brian says this is the order of
[2:07:30] adoption
[2:07:31] first to win the battle over sin
[2:07:36] secondly to take up your position
[2:07:39] as a son
[2:07:42] a ruler a king over sin sin does not
[2:07:46] rule you anymore you rule over sin and
[2:07:49] Abram was recognized amongst the Kings
[2:07:51] after his victory
[2:07:53] amen and his victory was also recognized
[2:07:56] by Melchizedek
[2:08:00] and what did God do after God victory
[2:08:04] he gave him a part of himself
[2:08:07] Abram was given communion
[2:08:10] and after he was given communion then
[2:08:13] adoption
[2:08:15] the blessing in his position as a son
[2:08:19] the prophet says it's a Compares with
[2:08:22] Ephesians 1. Paul an apostle of Jesus
[2:08:26] Christ who by by the will of God to the
[2:08:29] Saints which are emphasis and the
[2:08:32] faithful in Christ Jesus
[2:08:35] how do you get into Christ by one spirit
[2:08:38] amen Christ be unto you and peace from
[2:08:40] our Lord from God our Father and from
[2:08:43] the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God
[2:08:45] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[2:08:47] hath blessed us
[2:08:50] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[2:08:53] places
[2:08:55] he says here as we come to a close
[2:08:57] notice those Melchizedek as soon as he
[2:09:00] met Abram coming from the slaughter of
[2:09:02] the Kings the mystery of God now being
[2:09:05] made known who was he
[2:09:09] they can't find any history of him
[2:09:11] because he didn't have any father he
[2:09:14] never had any mother he never at any
[2:09:17] time he began he never had any time he
[2:09:19] ever died so ever he was he's still
[2:09:22] alive
[2:09:24] he never did have a beginning so he
[2:09:27] couldn't have been nobody else
[2:09:30] but yeah Ella Elohim the self-existent
[2:09:34] one
[2:09:36] almighty God
[2:09:37] and Abraham took his position
[2:09:41] after the church takes its position we
[2:09:45] are called unto the adoption of sons by
[2:09:49] the Holy Spirit and when each man takes
[2:09:52] his position what God has called him to
[2:09:55] do and stand to the end of the road
[2:09:58] going after the loss
[2:10:01] so after you have overcome find your
[2:10:04] position as a son he gives you a part of
[2:10:07] himself then he adopts you
[2:10:11] amen you have now full Authority you can
[2:10:14] say storm go back to your places little
[2:10:16] fishy I'll give you back to your life so
[2:10:19] stay at the arise I give it to them in
[2:10:21] the name of the Lord Jesus what was it
[2:10:23] when God and you now has become one
[2:10:27] Hallelujah so we find brother and sister
[2:10:29] amen
[2:10:31] let me just
[2:10:34] finish up by saying this in Matthew 26
[2:10:36] 26-32 said Melchizedek in human flesh
[2:10:39] came to establish a New Covenant after
[2:10:42] his battle was over
[2:10:44] with those who were part of the
[2:10:47] household of God
[2:10:50] those who will be with him in the
[2:10:52] father's Kingdom
[2:10:54] he made a promise we'll eat no more of
[2:10:56] the fruit of the Vine till I eat it and
[2:10:59] knew with you in my father's Kingdom
[2:11:03] amen hallelujah I don't want to read

[2:11:19] I'll drink it Anew with you in my
[2:11:22] father's Kingdom
[2:11:23] if he should come before another Easter
[2:11:26] comes
[2:11:27] if you should die before another Easter
[2:11:29] comes it will not prevent that great
[2:11:32] event
[2:11:34] for I say unto you by the word of the
[2:11:36] Lord that those which are to sleep in
[2:11:38] Christ shall come forth first
[2:11:40] and Weavers are alive and remain shall
[2:11:43] be caught up with them together in the
[2:11:46] air to meet the Lord and the great
[2:11:49] Melchizedek of Heaven the king of not of
[2:11:53] the natural Jerusalem but the king of
[2:11:55] the Heavenly Jerusalem the New Jerusalem
[2:11:58] will meet us and will be served again
[2:12:02] the wine and the bread
[2:12:04] so tonight while we take the symbols of
[2:12:07] this we ought to do it till we find him
[2:12:11] coming again
[2:12:12] may be found faithful as we bow our
[2:12:16] heads
[2:12:17] so brother and sister it's all those who
[2:12:20] are in a covenant with him
[2:12:22] we were a part of him before Genesis 1.
[2:12:26] and then the prophet came at the end
[2:12:28] time he revealed all the Mysteries he
[2:12:31] says before Genesis 1 you were in his
[2:12:33] mind
[2:12:35] and he came to show us
[2:12:37] when he revealed Lutheran was he also
[2:12:40] showed who the attribute Sons were they
[2:12:43] were all a part of him so we are all
[2:12:45] just one big family of God

[2:13:35] let's sing a little song I love him I
[2:13:38] love him because he first loved me and
[2:13:42] he purchased my salvation on calvary's
[2:13:45] tree
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:59] why do you love him
[2:14:01] because
[2:14:04] he first
[2:14:07] love me
[2:14:12] and
[2:14:14] word cheers
[2:14:17] [Music]
[2:14:30] if you love him raise your hands team
[2:14:31] tonight as we sing it together I love
[2:14:33] him

[2:15:00] and pray
[2:15:02] purchase my
[2:15:05] Salvage
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:20] amen you know there's so many things
[2:15:24] that were said that I really enjoyed
[2:15:27] I thought how he talked about Abraham
[2:15:30] that showed what Abraham was because he
[2:15:32] went after his Fallen brother
[2:15:35] amen and I and I I don't recall the
[2:15:39] quote just exactly how that a prophet of
[2:15:43] God said it he said but when that last
[2:15:45] one comes in
[2:15:46] amen we'll leave
[2:15:49] amen let's look for him
[2:15:52] you never know where he might be
[2:15:54] he might be in the place you're staying
[2:15:57] he might be in the place you're working
[2:15:59] he might be the person you meet
[2:16:01] somewhere you never know
[2:16:04] and then he made another statement that
[2:16:07] just really thrilled me I thought in my
[2:16:08] heart I want to preach on that someday
[2:16:12] he said they never examined
[2:16:15] the worshiper they only examined the
[2:16:19] sacrifice
[2:16:20] because if the sacrifice was right it
[2:16:23] was good enough to cover the worshiper
[2:16:26] and I thought you know that that
[2:16:29] that even applies when you look at
[2:16:32] somebody
[2:16:34] you know you don't examine them
[2:16:37] because I'll tell you if you would have
[2:16:40] seen me before my conversion you
[2:16:42] wouldn't have wasted your time
[2:16:45] but praise God he looked at the
[2:16:47] sacrifice and he knew the sacrifice was
[2:16:52] worthy and perfect enough to hide the
[2:16:55] multitude of sins and that's what we
[2:16:58] rest in don't ever look at the condition
[2:17:02] don't look at the symptoms
[2:17:05] don't look at anything in the Cardinal
[2:17:08] side look at the great sacrifice look
[2:17:12] what what how perfect that was and how
[2:17:16] it was so perfectly accepted
[2:17:19] it was the great father accepting the
[2:17:23] perfect sacrifice and believe me he'll
[2:17:25] do everything
[2:17:27] that you could ever hope or imagine it
[2:17:31] can do it can do exceedingly above
[2:17:35] whatever you could even ask or think
[2:17:39] that's how perfect that sacrifice us God
[2:17:42] bless you my brother and may you have a
[2:17:45] safe trip home and and send me an
[2:17:48] invitation I like South Africa that's

[2:18:06] and it it's grateful I I again
[2:18:10] we just ask you to keep my good friend

[2:18:16] got a great battle ahead of her but it's
[2:18:19] one the sacrifice can win do you believe
