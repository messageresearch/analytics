Description:
The Realm Of Faith - Faith Is The Sovereign Presence Of God
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
September 13, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

identify with this message and the work that you're doing in this hour father that our voice and our light might shine Lord in that where we put our shoulder to the wheel that it might be a a shiny example that there's hope in life for every man that doesn't have you Lord we ask again this evening that you be with us in your precious and holy name we pray amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to a little scripture and this is a great chapter in the Bible and it I know there's a lot more in it than I'm able to get out of it but I just hope as I we continue to grow in the Lord all the scripture will become more real to us so uh I'd like to read at starting uh in the ninth verse and and so Paul's writing here because people say well boy he writes a mean letter you know what I mean and and uh but when he's here he's feeble and then so this is he's writing back his response he said he says that I may not seem as if I would terrify You by letters for his letters say they are weighty and Powerful but his bold but but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible let such a one think this that such as we are in Word by letters when we are absent such will be we be also indeed when we are present in that a great scripture amen for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measure themselves by themselves comparing themselves among themselves are not wise amen so Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us this evening your precious name we pray amen you may be seated amen just just got back from a nice weekend in in uh Phoenix and came back to this beautiful weather and it was just wonderful and it felt so good we stepped out of the plane it was warm there and uh we had good reports from all those that complimented us and we don't know what the other people were saying you know so we just believe those that said we did good and everybody else uh it's okay but uh we we had uh I used Friday night we had a senior married couples uh banquet and uh and let me tell you I wasn't the most senior person there so uh kind of intimidating you know people married 60 65 years but uh we we preached a little subject matter called the one that you are the one that you are and we we know that God makes you makes Twain one flesh and then the scripture uh we went over and read in Ephesians where we're foreigned under good works that we should walk in them so we just you know we kind of presented out to the other people that you know it's not too late to serve God and that God does have a work and there's something that we should do for God apart from the church church isn't a substitute for what God would have you to do you know everybody thinks well religious work or spiritual work is church work not necessarily so amen you just be led to the spirit amen and then on Saturday night we preached that God put marriage in you God put marriage in you and so uh you know I mentioned how there's a lot of young men that said they they were oh I'm never going to get married I'm never going to get married and all of a sudden that one comes along you know and ruins the whole plan and uh so we talked about God putting marriage in you and how that he did it because it wasn't good for a man to dwell alone and then Peter goes over and he says now husbands love your wives and and have respect because their joint heirs together with you in the faith and so we just talked about how that you have an inheritance but you can't have it without her because he he put it in your heart to marry the one he had for you because his reward to you or to you together you know when everybody gets the idea well I'm going to get mine no she's got you know half of it so you can't get any of it without that one so it was a really nice time and and uh we've been talking a little bit about faith and we want to continue on faith tonight and uh I'd like just to make a few stains and I just want to listen to a few paragraphs this evening out of perfect faith and we know that faith is something that is of substance in other words I could almost say it like this I um maybe I shouldn't say it like this but faith is something you know you have you know what I mean it's a possession I don't want to call it that exactly a Feeling you know what I mean because that can be mixed up with emotions but if it's a gift of God and it's a revelation and faith is a revelation then it's actually absolutely something that you know that you received apart from yourself all of a sudden you know that this Faith isn't generated by me it's a gift of God God's he's inspired me and he's quickened me and he's brought this alive to me and he's made it real to me and and so that's what that what that that faith is it becomes a substance and now that substance that thing that God imparts to you that becomes the evidence right that you're going to see manifested what he revealed to you and quickened to you and the prophet of God's going to make a statement when we start he said faith is a seed so a seed is something that grows into something so maybe you're not well and you're seeking a healing for your body and and God comes along and he shows you that you're going to be well that he's a Healer and and you didn't have this but now this faith is given to you because faith is a gift and now you've been quickened you you've you you have this substance but now that substance is it is in evidence now it because it's a seed it's going to grow into the manifestation it doesn't have to happen and and we'll talk about those great Heroes of Faith so um and the one of the great things about faith is that if if it's it's if it's given to you of God um I just want to share this with you I hope it helps somebody it it stands alone you understand so if God gives me this Faith this Faith isn't related to anything else it stands alone it stands on its own mirror it's god-given and so what happens is your flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two things are contrary to the other and it's just like when you live you you drive you frustrations come and and fatigue comes in yeah sometimes you get annoyed and and you you you you're tempted and you do all those things but those things aren't you you understand none of that can be laid to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God remains in them so this is standalone so if I have this in my heart here you've never seen a person put a bottle of water in their heart before well I just did so it's here in my heart it doesn't matter what's coming against all this outside because it's given by God it can't be taken away from me that's the difference between drummed up Faith you understand and and word faith or Revelation Faith or gifted faith it can't be stolen from you and even no matter how bad the battle gets it still can't be stole you know Abraham it had that promise right and he couldn't even give it away it stands on its own and so we find out that Faith stands on its own it's something that's real and and so uh I like what Paul was talking here he says that they compare themselves among themselves yeah you know what I mean if and and so he go he goes on and takes a little a whole section about comparing and boasting and measuring and Paul says I'm not going to measure myself above any measurement than that which I've received of him this is my measuring is is the word of God it's Faith uh you know I mean in our world the prophet of God called The Max Factor world you know people they put pain on and everything and they got this whole idea what's beautiful and they they say this is beauty this is beauty this is beauty you know this is what pretty is and act and none of that is is real Beauty you know what I mean I mean it's Beauty the real beauty is character you know what I mean that's the real Beauty that's that's the real substance by by which you measure something and a real child of God measures uh His companion by by the character that they have and and of course there's many quotes that's not the subject that we want to go along but we're talking about about faith and and so one of the things that that men do is they measure and compare and this struck me as you know the Lord's been dealing with my heart on it and I'm I'm growing into it if I could say that with you and share with you uh what What's transpiring within myself but I'm beginning to realize that there is a a realm of faith and uh and the definition of a realm is a sovereign state sometimes it's referred to as a kingdom or a a a area of ground that is ruled over by a certain person well faith is or is a realm okay it's the realm of faith and if I could describe it to you this way just the way it came to me it says he says faith is the sovereign state of God's presence where he is The Sovereign Authority so the the faith is around and so because it's a realm or it's in existence it it can be measured by things seen you understand so in the realm of Faith there's no measurement there's no measuring there's no big eyes or little ears there's no great there's no powerful uh that there's you know oh this brother's got power or or or those things the prophet of God even says he says gifts are wonderful but you can't base your faith on them because it's a measurement and we measure We compare ourselves one with another the scripture tells us that your fools to compare yourself one with another because when you start doing that you're now taking away from The Sovereign presence of God and what was Abraham's measurement of Faith was that God is able to perform that's what he promised so that's the realm of faith and so we can't measure Faith by our temptations by our failures by the ever nagging voice of the Enemy by the uh by the darkness that's around us because that that you're measuring something by that you would say I don't possess this because it's dark out there is dark in the world or I don't have faith because I I get so frustrated or I get so discouraged no God didn't measure it by that faith is a gift of God lest any man should boast it was given Abraham was no different than any other person but God gave him a revelation and he believed that God could do it so he didn't measure it he he went into the Sovereign presence of God and that's the last sermon we preach here is that God faith is based on his presence that he's here and he's here to do what he said he would do it's not based on intellect it's not based on anything else it's based on the fact that he is here he hasn't gone away you know and I like what Paul said he said oh you say I write letters but I know when I come you're going to see what I write is going to be lived in front of you so the the Lord's here we don't see him but we know that he's here because he's made himself known to us we see it we know he's here because his word is coming to pass we know he's here because he's showing us these things that that he said would be happening and we know that they're happening we we know that he's here so we we met we don't measure by by among ourselves we don't measure we measure by his presence his presence is here and that's the realm that you want to go into is that is that great uh faith that it is and and just think that the the faith of that we have and what that were the challenge that's Pace before us so when we think of Abraham what we do is we measure Abraham by The Challenge he faced right Abraham was 80 years old and he believed God that they were going to have a baby so we kind of forget the faith and we looked at the the challenge you understand but God prepared Abraham the ground in Abraham's heart for him to accept and receive the faith to meet the challenge so we have a tendency to compare we think oh man Abraham Faith excuse me Abraham Faith because he accomplished this the it where Abraham was the father of all of our fans Abraham has no greater faith than you have but we think oh well this is the great work he accomplished Abraham never accomplished that work God accomplished that word it was the ever Sovereign presence of the Lord that performed that it was his presence that performed that great word but we have that we have a tendency to measure Faith by challenge now do you have faith to pick this water bottle up well if I have faith to pick this piano up does that mean I have more faith I never picked a piano up and you never picked a water bottle up he did it because he's sovereign faith is a sovereign presence of God God can do all things all things are possible in Christ Jesus amen we we measure righteousness oh this person lives really holy you know they they just you know you enjoy your righteousness it's filthy rights who's our righteousness he's Christ Jesus is our righteous he's our righteousness he's our identity he's our attorney he's our lawyer when you get up there you think you're going to present your righteousness no his righteousness he's going to stand there and say father I'm here I'm the representative I'm the righteousness my blood covers them they're in me amen you're not going to have to present Works you're not going to have to present anything that you've done that's going to get you in you you can you're not gonna lay a list of failures up there because he's throwing him in the sea of God's forgetfulness your blood bot your blood covered you're predestinated you're elected you're chosen you were pre-prepared boy we need to get out of the picture you know what I mean he's he's got something going on here he's in charge he's he's bringing it to pass he's gonna make you what he he wants you to be amen and so you don't measure the challenge we take we take Moses and we think Moses had great faith because he defeated pharaoh so we keep looking at the challenge and thinking that that the challenge is to the determination of faith but Abraham was prepared on the backside of the desert so God always prepares the ground to plant the seed in he makes the ground good and he plants the seed in it and it comes up now the person may be struggling with their self and struggling with their nature and struggling with the world in everything but but that's that's not laid to the Electoral the elect of that person because if it was then there would be some expectation of the person performing The Challenge apart from God does that make sense to you you know what I mean if you had to participate but because you you were never bugged you were never tempted you were never weary you were never discouraged you were never tempted you never made a mistake and everything well then you would think to think well not men well if I can do all that then I have some ability to meet the challenge but praise God he's going to meet the challenge for us so okay if you if I'm trying to make myself clear like I said I'm I'm walking through this myself and asking the Lord to open my eyes but we have such a tendency to measure the Challenger or or measure the the what we what we've got to overcome in other words a person that that believed God to be over a headache is lesser Faith than the person that believed God to overcome cancer no the person that had the headache needed God to heal him of a headache the person that had cancer needed God to heal him of a cancer in that case what you would want in order to have greater Faith you would want greater sickness that's a dead end Street I don't want to go down that road I'd Rather Have Faith keep me you know what I mean and then whatever comes up and whatever challenges Rises up against me that his faith is sufficient you know what I mean and his strength is made perfect in my weakness so we know these great things of Faith so we see this great challenge so like David you know we think oh David have faith why because he Faith Goliath well he did a lion he did a bear he did Goliath he could have done a lot of things so if I you understand what I'm trying to do I'm trying to get Faith to stand alone okay not measured because faith is The Sovereign presence of God The Sovereign ruling presence of God in the faith realm God rules that that's his Sovereign Place he rules it he this is it's done according to his will that Sovereign Place it's it's such a beautiful place so we we think of we think Daniel had Faith because the Lions didn't bite them well you know what I think the faith that you have and the challenge that you have is greater than all those challenges the challenge to withstand this devil of this evil age to me is is a greater Faith than any Goliath any Pharaoh you know in any lion to live in the God of this evil age and Satan's Eden to fight the God of this evil age that has totally rejected the word of God wants to make no stand for the word of God to me that's a greater challenge than any of these other carnal challenges because they were fighting flesh and blood but we're fighting spiritual wickedness in high places so don't let don't let your enemy the badgering of your enemy and the taunting of your energy of your enemy and and the darts and arrows that he throws at you thinking not strange at the fiery darts of the enemy and the trying of your faith we we don't let we don't let the negative be a measure and we don't let the challenge to be measured we know that we've been predestinated and prepared to sit in this hour and and meet the challenge for this age and that's why God said the the gospel of the world could not meet the challenge of the age and they couldn't believe because they didn't have anything in them to believe with oh I hope that comforts you you see when Paul says don't compare don't measure then we get into a church and we measure churches by numbers we measure them by their music we measure them by their opera singers we measure them by the the emotional power of their preachers and and the word of God sitting back wait a minute that's carnal faith is is is The Sovereign Realm of the presence of God where he rules in that Realm so can you imagine that if we could put our faith in his word and so I I I said that tonight because I just want to play this little portion of the the sermon this evening um it's just a little segment out of uh out of uh uh works as Faith expressed where brother REM talks about Noah and he talks about Moses and he talks about David and and their faith and how God prepared the ground and and it's beautiful and and so we just like to do that this evening so I don't know if you have a device I hope your device isn't a vice and we're going to start at paragraph 151 and uh I I know it offends uh some people like if you don't play the whole tape or you just played a segment but to me it's like going in and reading a chapter out of your Bible you know what I mean reading a quote to me is like reading a verse you know you don't have to read the whole book every time it's the word of God and so we hope it blesses you I hope that this little thought that might sow into your heart as a seed and and that it might grow because what my desire is in my heart is to grow into the awareness to be able to know which is good and which is evil to grow into the awareness to see God move you understand to understand the things of God to see God move so in the open door area how many knows the open door area in the time of the reformers it was called the open door right well the way that you knew God was moving was how the gospel was being spread and how converts were coming in and men were going out with with the message we called them circuit writer preachers or Apostles or missionaries and they were they were going and setting up churches and and they were going and you could sit back and watch the hand that God move well what would be our recognition of the hand of God moving in this day when Satan can impersonate every gift so you'd have to have to have an ability not to measure not to measure challenge not to measure what you're up against you'd have to have the ability to see him standing in his word doing and Performing exactly what he said he would do Lord give me I sap that I might see give me white random it the main the shame of my nakedness doesn't appear you know he's not talking about seat coats and dresses he's talking about the lack of Revelation the the the the shame of of of not being clothed with God's word and having the understanding of God's word and then give me gold character that what I read and what I see in the faith that I have in me that God placed within me that that will be fruitful and we won't be barren and we could see the fruits so we would know by being able to see that the church is moving into and God's moving because we're being formed into that statue of a perfect man and that Capstone of Love is coming down in our hearts and the love of God is being shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit now wouldn't that be something if you could see the love of God in you instead of seeing the old negative failures measuring and comparing but loving without measure oh I believe it's possible Lord help me but anyway let's let's just listen to this and I hope that as you see these great men and what they overcome and the challenges they meant I want you to understand that what the faith that they had to do that was god-given you know what I mean god-given and God prepared him and God gave it to him and there's some tremendous statements here but Lord bless you tonight I I certainly hope you enjoy this portion I hope that your faith looks up and that you understand faith is just right here it's here for you it's here for you Lord open my eyes and come into my heart be real to me so Lord bless your brother David if you go ahead and play that for us thank you there's bound to be a womb somewhere for it to fall into just as he said all things are possible to them that believe if you say to this mountain don't doubt your heart you can have what you said see there's got to be somewhere that's right notice now we find that Isaiah here spoke it the Virgin Mary as soon as the grounds has already broke up she'd been a virgin run around the grounds have been already prepared are predestinated before knowledge of God even said she's a virgin right then God knows what her name would be for her name is on the Book of Life in heaven then it was Vindicated man then to man saw the expression of it by the works when it was already done now we look back say sure it was done because we see the works that was done Noah's Works expressed demand what is faithful isn't God's promise now God met Noah and he said Noah it's going to rain I'm going to destroy the whole Earth with water not never had rain that's the impossibility well now Noah God said prepare an ark if the dimensions that I'll tell you about and him being a carpenter and he went to work and began to take his foot out and everything to cut the boards and fix it up there with the of wood and put the pitch in it just like he said and do you imagine what people thought about that man hmm they said that man is actually crazy because he says it's going to bring water out of the heavens and there's no water up there but you see Noah didn't think about that his Works was expressing to the people what his faith was and what God Said would take place that's the reason the genuine Christian separates himself from everything but the word of God no matter what the people think what anybody else says he's separated because he isn't just saying that if he is it won't be long until these Works will be made on he'll fall back and slip this away and join this and this and start you you show what he is but if he's a genuine if the word of God has vetted into him then it's going to bring forth his kind you'll see that man preparing for that great hour see that's why Noah did Moses with a stick in his hand came to take the people from pharaoh now could you imagine Moses the Bible said that he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians he was smart he could teach her interlex things he is taught all their wisdom he didn't need to catch up on his education now you just think about a man out there in the wilderness with all that education and then God appearing to him and said Moses take this stick in your hand and go down there in Egypt and bring my children out with this switch you got your hand just lick the whole thing with this switch not one of Moses had said sir just a moment I thought I was talking to an intelligent being this great I am that you say you are now how in the world would I ever take this little old Crooked Stick I got here in my hand and take over an army of millions of man arm with Spears spiders and I'm not a fighter I'm a shepherd how can I ever do that there was no question why why the ground in his heart he was a predestinated person gifts and callings are without repentance God have told Abraham that he would do that and there was the ground prepared and Moses toughness stick and went down there and took that Nation out of a Nation what'd he come with the stick in his hand he told Pharaoh let him go Pharaoh seen in Moses the works that he had faith in what he was going to do or trying to do he had faith in the promise of the god and made the promise he went down to take it over no other man would have done that and no other man could have done it he was ordained to do it God beforehand had told Abraham that that's just what would happen and when the time of the promise Drew not there was a little boy born a fair child and the parents Abraham addressed the Bell Was Not Afraid of the king's Commandments see there was something the grounds was already prepared oh God I hope I'm speaking to ground prepare her tonight at the sea can fall in the right place and it's going to be if it isn't it won't happen that's just same thing we say brother Bram that kind of takes it away from us if it does it takes away from Christianity too see you can impersonate anything but if it really falls in the word of God falls in the right kind of ground it's going to bring forth this kind it's got to because it's a seed nor Moses his Works Express faith in the promise of the God that he believed Pharaoh the man could see what was not he couldn't see how Moses is going to do it but he knows Moses believed what he was talking about or he wouldn't be standing in the palace there's a stick in his hand said buy this stick I'll take him out from you the old man 80 years old not an athlete an old man stoop shoulder and Whiskers hanging down to his probably his waistline gray hair if you had any and there was that stick in his hand saying I'm going to take him out let the people go thus saith the Lord if you don't do it God's going to judge you amen why that's was he afraid why just one Arrow one Spirit anything else would have ended it he was Fearless you know exactly where he was standing the girls Mighty pharaoh yes sir for her God told him you will come to this mountain again and he knows he was going there Hallelujah we know what we're going to at the end of this journey God has promised there's a land beyond the river be Peerless in your testimony amen if it's revealed to you are fearless you don't care if the whole wow what they say your Fearless One is revealed to you that this is the truth coming from God then you be Fearless not you can't be David with the shepherd swing expressed to the whole Israelite Army the faith that he had in their God now there was Goliath on the other side and he stood out there and made his voice many times bigger than David he had fingers 14 inches long and he was a man with big self the Palestine Giant and here was David the smallest one he was even too little to be in the army too much of a runt they couldn't use him so his brothers is out there in the army and then Goliath is making his boast but David now remember it was revealed today he thought here is the armies of the Living God standing in their own land and there's a boasted uncircumcised Philistine on Earth we'll call him cancer tonight they're called it paralytics why David was no kind of a match for him not with any kind of a weapon he was no match that man's shoulders is probably 10 12 foot across it's probably saying 14 15 foot high a spear like a Weaver's needle probably 20 foot long the blade on it maybe four foot across and a little David stand there with a little piece of leather goat skin or sheepskin with two pieces of strain tied to it but it was revealed to him [Music] Revelation struck him hey man he said the god that took me out of the paws of the bear that took me out of the Paws Of The Line how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand his brothers way more able to do it Saul Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them amen there it is they believed it could be done they believe that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David now there's a difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds it may be worse than David had gone but if it's revealed to you and notice revealed David he said that they are cut your Hill oh God by grace in that crucial moment when decisions had to be made let's save God that producer Grace in that day and drop that seed of faith in that little Hunchback looking boys being in his heart that same God in this crucial moment can take that woman from the wheel share that man that's how it hurts [Music] that little green of faith is revealed to you and I don't care how long it takes now notice they're Giant on the other side didn't believe it neither will the cancer he likes you said I'm a hot dog you send that kid out here to fight me so I'll pick you up on him a spear and let the birds eat your flesh why he had all the all everything for his side but you see that didn't Shake David at all why it was revealed to him he had faith in what he was doing he knowed he was going to do it and he did it is because that it was revealed to him and he knowed where he's standing and if God would respoke that right down in your hard time said you're not going to be laying in that bed you're not going to be sitting that chair you're going to be well there couldn't be anything change your mind in it but until that happens ever preaching a world could pray I don't say it wouldn't help you it wouldn't encourage you but until that faith see the healing power is in you it don't come from the preacher it comes to you by Revelation by faith not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord my spirit by Grace reveals this to you and there's nothing to take it away by faith Revelation then David to prove his words now some of them said I know you're naughty his brother said you come up here to see the battle now you get on back where him sheep was he said let me speak to Saul The General and Saul said now son I admire your courage but you see you're nothing but a youth and he is a lawyer from his shoes you're no match for him said I was standing my father's sheep he could face it on something amen oh brother and the god that saves your soul can he heal your body [Music] it's just the same reveal you he's your healer as you as your savior but it's got to be revealed that's the difference he had some of the bassist faith on how this never happened before but said the same God that deliver me from the paws of the lion will deliver me from that uncircumcised Philistine how you know David I believe it why it's been revealed to me and he said he knows what he was talking about because of the giant said I'm going to feed you to the birds he said I'm going to cut your head off there's a difference and he did it Samson caught out one day off guard in a prairie and yet come a thousand Philistines up on him and he looked down on the ground and there's where a Mueller died and he picked up the old draw Jawbone dry as it could be and took out after those felicities beating him over the head with this old dry Jawbone of a mule as far as I know not a twos never fell out of it and then Philistine helmets is probably inch thick because they beat one another water clubs in those days to keep a man from beating him on the head but he took the Jawbone of that you and beat down a thousandth listings and the Jawbone never broke you just kept beating him like that as you come up the rest of them took off for the rocks there's getting away from him wow he believes it sometimes sure I want to tell you something work on that pulsation that spare of a moment like Joshua did like Mary Magdalena although just that moment when something is revealed to you rabbit hold to it that's fair of a moment yes it was revealed to him he went to meet these thousands Philistines now what do you think when those three states said now look coming there that little shrimp only about four foot and a half tall to begin with with seven little curls hanging on his back like Mama's Little see come along there with a job order the mule and look at us what a great Army we are isn't that ridiculous but what was he doing he was expressing to those Philistines what have been revealed to him by God he grabbed the Jawbone and took off because that's what he put his hand he put that in his hand that's what he believed he could do it and by doing so he was expressing to those Philistines what God had put in his heart to do John the Baptist expressed his faith by is worse and when he said there stands one among you now just think of that St John's I got the Saint John 126. he said they said you say the messiah's coming why I said man what's the matter with you we've been looking for him for four thousand years he said he's standing right among you now so easy tonight hey man he expressed his faith by his Revelation because it was revealed to him and he knowed he would baptize the Messiah there's a man 30 years old he knowed he had to be there somewhere you never knew who he was and yeah I was standing right among them he said there's one staying among you now who you know not and I'm not worthy to lose the latches on his shoes but he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and he's right among you now he expressed it his faith because he known in his day he was to see and baptize God's Messiah so you see the people could see the expression upon him and the way he was preaching and the way he was acting was expressing that he had a true Revelation from God now to prove that it was true walking right out of the crowd come the Messiah just an ordinary young man walking down through there dressed like other man John said behold there's a Little Lamb of God that takes away The Sinner [Music] how do you know him he said he that said to me in the wilderness upon whom now shall see the spirit descending that's the one that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost he knew him because there was supposed to be a sign about that time are you catching it John knew just about the hour because he was a prophet it was revealed to him they didn't know it'd be about that time he'd see a sign and when he seen that sign he said he's standing upon you know it was there well I see the sign that the end time is here I see the things that's promised for this end time message coming to pass John folding just exactly like the scripture says and I know that the time is at hand uh say that without hesitance I believe it's right at hand where I see the signs that he said but happened just before that time it's ready to happen now John expressed his faith and what God had revealed to him therefore works is space testimony when they see you acting like you're healed then they'll know you got faith that you are healed first testimony say ing this ah I have it now because I have received God's promise it is now working in me I am making ready for it to happen see that's what your test your Works does well sure you're some time ago next to my last trip in Africa I was just over there this spring but trip before then there's a little uh baby it had club feet and one foot uh late shorter than the other it never wore shoes in its life or it's the most horrible to farm and I prayed for the baby that night they've watched and seen those things done they prayed for the baby and the next morning I went out and walked by a shoe store I walked in there and there was the man buying the baby a pair of shoes to wear he believed it like this man over here that believed that God would give you the baby sure you believe it's going to happen made ready for it I'm making ready although no physical results seen as yet but that didn't make a bit of difference he believed in like Abraham called anything contrary as though it was not sold there therefore if your intellectuals does tell you oh here's the Stinger now if your intellectuals does tell you that this is the truth God is the Healer of sickness your mind can witness that that is the truth but if there is not the betting ground in your heart Faith to fall in to express it it will not happen so much no matter how much is outside man can reason it with the scriptures and say it's right that still doesn't make it right how many takes the tapes did you get my sermon out long ago the anointed ones of the last days did you believe that amen see it said there will be Antichrist Antichrist would almost deceive the very elected if possible it can't because it's impossible they're elected see all right Revelation and that would just continue to grow in that faith in that you notice all of them had mockers and scoffers and trying to point to them but it was it was in there because it Faith stands alone it was revealed by God's word you love him tonight let's stand together and our Prophet told us to pray for revelation maybe you believe something just like he said at the end but ask God to prepare your heart get the ground prepared and give you the seed of Revelation that you know that now you can do the works that proves that that faith is there those chap Bauer heads musicians get come and and we'll prepare to go forward this evening maybe you have something on your heart that you need the Lord to do for you and and don't hope I can say this just right don't pray for the thing pray for the faith that will bring it to pass and then it'll come to pass just according to the faith that God gave you you don't get Faith for your plans for your program for your little intellectual scheme you just lay before the Lord and say Lord here's my need give me the faith give me the substance give me a revelation that you're going to take care of it then I'm going to live knowing that you'll take care of it and it'll come to pass oh Lord if you have something you'd like to lift your hand up to him this evening and say Lord I need revelation of Deliverance I need revelation of healing father I need a revelation that you're going to give me a job I need a revelation that you're going to take care of my finances Lord I need the gift of faith from you Lord prepare my ground and plant the sea and reveal it to me and then I know I'll grow into it Lord oh so perfectly
