refreshed and ready to praise the Lord and look forward to the word amen why don't you just turn around and greet one another and welcome them to the house of God all right good morning just go ahead and bow our heads and we'll just open the Service in a word of prayer and commit the service to him welcome his presence Among Us father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you for your abundance Supply Lord in this period of Thanksgiving Lord how we thank you Lord for your faithfulness for meeting every need Lord for supplying even more than we're able to ask for giving us health and strength father and for directing our steps for making yourself known to us and drawing us unto you Lord how could we have anything but thanks for what you've done for us Lord we thank you for this opportunity to come together once again Lord of worship at your feet to learn of you Lord we're not here as a just simply as a religious ceremony that we might see one another and perform our religious duty but father we have an expectation Lord that when we come together we have committed this time to you Lord that you might have your perfect will that your word would be made known in us that your work would be accomplished in US Lord you know every need you know every desire and Lord we pray that as we're here this morning that you would as you promised you would come by our way and just meet us where we are Lord we commit the service to you in Jesus name amen but we're going to read Psalm 57 this morning and you know as you're turning there it's always interesting to me to see kind of the circumstances or the life experiences that are going on with David when he writes a certain psalm you know at least it helps at least me get a sense for what's going on in his life at the time that that some Psalm comes to his heart and comes forth and there's a little footnote a little introduction at the beginning of Psalm 57. it says he wrote this particular Psalm when he fled into a cave when he fled from Saul in a cave now I think most of us are probably familiar with the story it's in first Samuel 22. it says in verse first Samuel 22 1 David therefore departed dense and escaped to the cave abdullum and when his Brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down dither to him and we know the story David's on the Run you know he had achieved great victories victories that even the king of the land had been unable to perform and he had a life and a testimony that were beginning to draw the people unto him and this King began to recognize that this one might have the power to fulfill the prophecy which was spoken saying that your kingdom would be taken and given to another and so he goes out to and fro seeking to destroy him and you know it's in the middle of that that he runs to a cave David runs to a cave to hide from this one that would seek to destroy him he's in there hiding and he begins to write Psalm 57 verse 1 it says be merciful unto me o God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed and as you just begin to go through Psalm 57 you see as he's beginning to cry out that the Lord would keep him that the Lord would protect him that the Lord would watch over him and he's hiding in this cave and you know you can begin to maybe understand that in his hour of desperation when this trial when this attack is coming against him that his reaction is to hide fear for his own safety so he's hiding in a cave when he's been anointed to be a king and you know I suppose we all find ourselves in that place at some point it's only human nature some attack of the enemy comes against us whatever tool he uses to seek to destroy the overcomer that has the power to take his kingdom whether it's Financial whether it's an offense whether it's sickness whatever the trial may be and we can get lost in our circumstance we can get lost in our trial where we go and it's we hide in our little cave and everything becomes even our testimony becomes all about our trial our burden my circumstance and we begin to even have our testimony be how we're enduring in our trial and not about him and we become so focused in our little circumstance and we we put ourselves in a little cave we crawl into our little shell the little safe place that we build for ourselves and we hide there to try to protect ourselves from or in the trial and not only that if we're not careful we can build a little Fellowship of others around us a little Fellowship of that circumstance it's what happened with David in first Samuel 22. it says in verse 2 and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them so here's David in his little cave with his little Fellowship calling upon the Lord to be his help in his little trial to protect him from his trial to protect him from his circumstance and it becomes all about the trial but you know what's interesting is there came a point in time where God sent a prophet David's way with thus saith the Lord and it says in verse 5 of first Samuel 22 5. and the prophet Gad said unto David abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of Judah you know as David prayed for God's protection and his deliverance and his keeping hand and you know just became all about God protecting him in his little trial in his little cave with his little Fellowship of suffering and the word of the word of God came on the scene it said the protection is not in the hiding the protection is the work you need to get to work you've been anointed to be an overcomer you've been anointed to be a king don't hide in your little trial or in your little cave with your little Fellowship that you've built around you around your circumstance but get out there and be about Kingdom Business you know and it's I thought about that about how many times I sit in my little cave of adulam where whether it's some offense or whether it's some trial or some burden or some hardship and I try to build a little safe place for myself and then I built a little Fellowship around my little circumstance and all the while I need to be about Kingdom Business you know thus saith the Lord to David was to get out of this cave get out of this little Fellowship that you've created for yourself and get to work the protection that he was asking for was in him doing the work not in him hiding from The Trial and I think that if we're not careful we sometimes forget that the protection comes from being about his business not from being hidden away in a place of safety and as Gad finished with us saith the Lord it's interesting to see as David's writing psalm 57. you know he goes from a cave hiding in a cave to verse 1 in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my refuge he goes from huddling with a little Fellowship to verse 9 I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the Nations see there was a work for David to do among the Nations among the people Kingdom Business and he couldn't do that hiding away in a cave seeking protection from The Trial being comfortable with the little Fellowship that he built around the trial and the circumstance you know and as we read Psalm 57 this morning there's one particular verse that stuck out to me in verse 2. says this I will cry unto God most high unto God that performeth all things for me not to me but for me and it occurred to me how often when we have a trial or a circumstance or whatever we tend to think that this is happening to me I'm the victim of what's being done here no it's being done for you God is performing all things for me for you and it's interesting that that's what David's thinking was at some point he came to the realization that though that ruler of this land may be coming against me to destroy me the same prophecy which said that I would overcome him was the same one that said I would sit on a throne and so rather than hide in a cave in the little Fellowship of my trial I'm going to be out there on Kingdom Business because he performeth all things for me and I have a promise so it just kind of struck me as I was reading that to maybe it's sometimes helpful to look at ourselves and make sure we've haven't built for ourselves a little cave of the doulam that we're hiding in when things get a little bit tough but we continue to be about Kingdom Business so let's just read Psalm 57 this morning just a little Psalm we'll start reading together in verse one be merciful unto me o God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed I will cry unto God most high unto God that performeth all things for me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up Selah God shall send forth his mercy and his truth my soul is among lions and I lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are Spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword be thou exalted o God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the Earth they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are Fallen themselves Selah my heart is fixed o God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise a wake up my glory awake Sultry and harp I myself will awake early I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the Nations for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds be thou exalted o God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the Earth praise the Lord aren't you glad we have a refuge we have a protection I want to sing that song are you washed in the blood of the Lamb you may have your seats I'm at Key of a flat I believe a

bless us today in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you I just want to read us one scripture to you this morning uh before uh oh I think I left my glasses in there but I think I can uh here I got a pair I'm afraid when I reach for glasses I'm going to pull out sunglasses and it it found over in Luke we have brother Daniel freyjo get a minister uh to us this morning that that's brother Shiloh's dad sister Karen's with us Mom God bless you sis good to see you and I appreciate our brother being here with us and and having this time of Fellowship together I thought it's Thanksgiving right and I just got to thinking of what what what is what am I most thankful for you know and I when I start to thinking of all the goodness that God's put in my life but I I got to thinking of this right here and it says fear not little flock this is Luke 12 and 32 fear not little flock for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and then I was reading in this message called three kinds of Believers and brother brand made this statement he said and today the very God that spoke of this age is on the scene doing exactly what he said he would do and they're too blind to see it and I thought my heart you know every age God gives the believer Something to Believe that separates them from everybody else it doesn't make no sense it's not logical it doesn't fit with Society it's just something that God puts out there and says believe this and there's something in you that believes it and I I thought what what am I thankful I'm thankful that I believe you know I of all the things I'm thankful that God let me see that that that he showed me in this day a little hippie boy in San Diego California that didn't have any connection the greatest connection that I had to God was the Catholic Church and that's got 666 wrote on it you know what I mean and the Antichrist sitting on the throne that was my connection to God and through it all you know what I mean he got his grace and his mercy and give me I sap because it was his good pleasure to give us the Kingdom look I thought Lord I want to do this testify I'm thankful today that God let me see and believe Lord help my unbelief increase my faith may I grow in you and all the things that you have for me may I just be a partaker of all your benefits and so we've asked our brother to speak to us today of those great benefits and uh and I told him um that he could sit down and preach to us if he likes so we'll just grab a chair and grab me that chair right there and he may not have to use it he may get under the anointing and run around this but I do know that he had a hip replaced here just last year so if you can't stay too long then I want to make him feel comfortable sitting down as you know I sat down last week so that was just the Lord God's wonderful and he got the memo amen so he's here he's moving he's hidden Simplicity do you love him let's sing Amazing Grace this morning in it it wasn't it Wonderful Grace I noticed we've got some young musicians today I didn't know he came out of the woodwork you know there's Talent around here I don't even know about but in the grace of God wonderful amazing grace oh it's amazing grace amen help me sing it this morning as we invite our brother amen foreign [Music] [Music] but now [Music] oh and we've been there Ten Thousand Years Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] to see God's grace [Music] worship from praise God praise God oh he loves you this morning oh think Howie loves you amen [Music] praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God and praise God praise God God bless you all this morning good to be here once again and we've always enjoyed when we've come down and you've always been a very attentive group to minister to so we're just happy to be here once again we thank Brother David for this opportunity and maybe you'll turn with me this morning to the scriptures and we'll be reading from Revelations chapter 8. I'm sure it's a scripture well known to most everyone here and yet probably in the list of least understood it's it's probably on that list Revelations 8 and verse 1. and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space about half hour we'll read it once again and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again we believe every word Lord from Genesis to the last book of Revelations Lord and can we believe this book has been open to us Lord Jesus it's the revelation which is a personal experience that we're needing granted to each and every one of us in Jesus name amen you may be seated the question's always been uh and it will probably always be till God takes a bride home because the book open is the book closed has it been revealed has it not been revealed and and the question just continues on and on and on but I'd like to share with you a quote from the Brandon what he said in the first seal when he began preaching on this series of course it was eight it was 10 services and eight days of of meetings and in the first seal he says this it begins in in paragraph 38 and he says and they're about 12 o'clock in the day the Holy Spirit just swept right down in the room and the whole thing just opened up to me because of this first seal being open so it declares that this first seal he says God has opened it up to us in the third seal paragraph 250. he's speaking on this third seal he's winding it all up now he says now the lamb has got the book in his hand breaking the seals he says he's broke the first one second one and now he breaks the third one and as he breaks it the lamb breaks it this third seal he goes on same so now by the time he gets to the third seal and he's closing it he says first seal second seal third seal it's broke it's open in the four seal paragraph 132 he says now there you are friends here's the fourth seal opened and the Riders of the four horses revealed revealed at least to him when he was done because Revelation is a personal experience with Jesus Christ the opening of the book is the work of the father's hands it's the work of the Lamb of God for it's the Lamb's Book of Life is what it was called so the lamb alone could open it yeah in the fifth seal paragraph 435 closing up on that service but the Brahm says I do think rather by the opening of this fifth seal as I believe that it's open to us I did it with good conscience with clear Revelation before God not trying just to think because I always was against organization it never would belong to them but it's open to me now okay the book he was telling us it's an open book when he preached on The Sixth Seal paragraph 143 he says did you enjoy the Sixth Seal you see where it's opened at now have you believed it he said who has believed our report and to whom as the arm of the Lord been revealed so now he connects Isaiah 53 with the opening of this word because Isaiah 53 was indeed the Old Testament prophecy of the first coming of Christ and the opening of the first seal then we jump down to stand in the Gap 1963. it's June now three months after he preached those seals and he says well it happens to be that at least one man is present this morning who was standing there when it happened speaking of what took place on Sunset Mountain those seven angels coming down he said could actually shook the Rocks off the mountain okay so we find out during that time I I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid swept down and picked me up and I was brought East to open up the Seven Seals for God if you haven't got them if Jesus tarries my great-grandchildren little Paul's children that still will be the Eternal truth of the Living God now that was to find out what was sealed inside this mountain now he's speaking of those six dreams that he spoke of and serves as the time he says that wasn't wrote it had to be interpreted and when I come back he says the first angel in other words when I came back from Jeffersonville the first angel on the first night opened the seal contrary to anything we ever heard in our life and all seven came out the same way he said you know that you know that he said you were present when it happened many of you the book this Bible from Genesis to Revelations it is a book that God has opened up and sometimes we think it's a book that was just recently opened in 1963. but the first time that the book was opened the lion of the tribe of Judah opened it and he opened it to Israel and Revelations 5 and 5 says can he he says John don't weep for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof so when was the book first open at the first coming of Christ who was the first to open it once again Jesus Christ the Lamb of God but he opened it to who he opened it to Israel he opened it to the firstborn son the lion took the Lion's Share of the fig tree and when he ordained his Twelve Apostles he said don't go to the Gentiles and don't go amongst the Samaritans go only to the house of Israel and take this New Testament and to John the Baptist it was told he would preach the Kingdom of Heaven no longer preaching the law it wasn't the law that Israel rejected or all the rituals that they had been involved in in their synagogue what Israel rejected was the word made flesh the word revealed the book open a book of redemption Seven Seals I'm going to simplify it because the language of the Bible is designed by God for a purpose to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it unto babes but Seven Seals is Simply Seven parts of one Divine Plan of Redemption and restoration for the fig tree and for the bright tree it's a promise it's a new testament it's an open book of redemption of how to get back to Eden how to live in the presence of God of how to make him welcome in our congregations and in our homes turn with me to Revelations 5 and verse 9. I would like to entitle what we'll share this morning is modern events made very clear by prophecy and we want to look at how prophecy is written in the Bible from one verse to the next and I thought one of the Prime examples of that would be in Revelations 5. Revelations 5 1-9 this Vision that John saw covers a period beginning back in Eden about 4000 BC and in nine verses takes us to the to the 21st century that's how prophecy is written Revelations 5 and 1 says can I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals historians can art archaeologists and all counting back from the birth of Christ to Eden and that day in Genesis 3 21 where the father was dressing Adam and Eve and lambskins that he had created Revelations 5 1 is said estimated to be about 4000 BC in Revelations 5 and 2. and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and loose the seals are up in verse 2 we fast forward now to the year 1446 BC because you see Visions have a lifespan just like you and I and a can a vision can be can be calling us of a period that that's just of 24 hours of the vision can be a period of a thousand years the vision can be a period of two thousand years The Vision by a little comma can be broken up into two parts that are two and three thousand years apart and yet we read it as a single sentence right through and we never catch it and that's the way God designed to prophecy to be written so he could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent intelligent men with high IQs saying that's no way to write a book but God said it pleased the father Lord I thank you Father that you've hidden these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent who reveal it unto babes such as would learn so in Revelations 5 2 it says and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof in verse 2 we fast forward to the year 1446. it's Israel's 11th Hour the first Exodus has begun because the morning after the Death Angel The Pale Horse Rider sweeps through the Egypt and the angel of the Covenant a strong Angel which leads them out of bondage they've entered into a journey and it's a character building process for Israel Revelations 5 2 is the year 1446. so from one verse to the next the prophecy jumps over 2000 years but there's a reason the reason in is this Vision that John was seeing was simply showing God descending simply showing God changing forms for one sole purpose to get closer to you this morning from God the father and the throne with the book that was closed to the angel of the Covenant can start it moving amongst the people of Israel as the pillar of fire and a pillar of cloud but from one verse to the next a 2500 year Spanish is jumped verse verse 3 of Revelations 5 can no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon not only is the strong Angel leading them out he simultaneously looking for a man who is Worthy to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof this isn't two separate things though it sounds that way to loose the wax heel from a scroll or open the screw but the emphasis in the prophecy was on Seven Seals but the sealed was what held a scroll shut and when the seal was removed you didn't keep the seal that was discarded you opened the scroll and inside the scroll was a message a message designed just for you and just for me a message to changes to make us new creatures in Christ Revelations 5 and 5 says and one of the elders saith unto me weep not to Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals are up Revelations 5 5 the year's 30 A.D it's jumped another 1500 years just from a few verses down Jesus beginning his ministry at 30 years of age his third pole ministry as the lion of the tribe of Judah King of the Jews and the lion is taking the Lion's Share Israel the Fig Tree and is opening the book and loosening the the seals to Israel first what Israel rejected was given to a gentile church at the cross of Calvary Revelations 5 5 The Years now 30 A.D foreign so who and when was the seals open 30 A.D I received that by Revelation because I wasn't born yet neither were any of you but that's when God first opened the book that's when he loosed the seals as the line of the tribe of Judah extending A Plan of Redemption and salvation to Israel no more under the law the law and the prophets were until John but since John since that prophet he says the Kingdom of Heaven is now preached not the law not the rituals but the kingdom of heaven was now being preached it was no longer the preaching of an old Covenant it was a New Covenant it was a new testament it was a living way for the old way was was death but the new way was life that's the book that was open The Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life Revelations 5 and 6 and I be held can loan in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain with seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth Revelations 5 and 6 is in thousands of years ahead now Revelations 5 and 6 is just three and a half years later Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane to pray for one hour he entered the garden as king of the Jews and in one hour he came out from the Lamb of God it was God in morphe not changing forms as before but changing Ministry from here he's taken to Calvary on crucifixion day this is Revelations 5 and 6. just three and a half years later after Revelations 5 5. he has a ministerial change from Lion to lamb because the open book The revealed word these Seven Seals or these seven parts of one Divine Plan of Redemption that was offered first to Israel when they rejected at the cross of Calvary was given to a gentile bride we've got what they rejected and what we've received when God takes us in a rapture will be given back to Israel again a hundred and forty four thousand real genuine Sons and Daughters of God whose names too are in the Lamb's Book of Life for it's the lamb that's going back for them so this Revelations 5 from verse to verse it jumps a thousand two thousand years from one verse to the next it doesn't read like any other book that you'll ever read it takes revelation it takes it takes prayer it takes meditating upon his word and blessed is he that meditates on this word both day and night Revelation 6 he dies he's buried he rises the third day and is amongst his disciples for 40 days then he ascends on high Revelations 5 6 it's 35 A.D and we have a symbol of a lamb as the doe had been slain before the very Throne of God in that seventh Dimension with seven horns seven eyes the seven spirits of God a slame lamb clam before the altar of God wherefore four thousand years Lucifer would stand to accuse the sons of God but that day on Calvary he was cast down there was a spot since the beginning of Eve where Satan was allowed to go to job and accuse the Saints and challenge God they serve you because you bless them they serve you because you give them a nice job they serve you because they have a nice car okay serve you because you have a nice Church God said I beg to differ with you let's take it all away and I'll show you who he is you see the tender hand of Jehovah in our own lives and there was a spot where Lucifer always stood to make his accusations before the people of God but that day on Calvary he was cast down and what ascended to that spot where Lucifer once stood now lays the Lamb of God interceding for us night and day we have access to the throne through Jesus Christ Our Lord and the blood that was shed for us on Calvary and never again will God hear a discouraging word about you before his throne here on Earth it's the greatest battle you ever fought because when Satan can't accuse you there anymore he comes straight to you to accuse you but know this that before this that seventh dimension in the very presence of God there's a lamb interceding okay in that spot now lays the Lamb of God Jesus Christ a sin offering so we could be his righteousness a healing bomb for our body Soul and Spirit changing us from the inside out through a born-again experience three steps of Grace to the baptism of the Holy Ghost refilling after refilling unto perfection and Revelations 5 and 6 the years 35 A.D we've moved we've moved in six verses from 4000 BC to 35 A.D it's how the prophetic word is written Jesus said father I thank you that you've hidden these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent can you reveal it to babes such as we're learned he's talking about folks that have been born again that's why Jesus told Nicodemus Nicodemus unless you be born again you cannot see the kingdom of heaven hmm so here the lamb is now opening the book to a gentile church it's his second coming the lion Ministry was his first coming in Revelations 5 and 7 it says can he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne now it may sound redundant I thought in verse 5 he had already taken the book that was the lion of the tribe of Judah that was the first coming of Christ that was from the book was delivered to Israel alone the lion took the Lion's part the fig tree now the lamb is going to take the Lamb's part a gentile Church the bride of Christ now the book is being opened to another people now the book has been opened to a younger church that was born on the day of Pentecost remember the Old Testament allegory of Jacob took his two sons place the owl disk at Jacob's right hand the youngest at his left hand because it was the custom of the Jewish people and it can Jacob being an old man the Bible said blind to Joseph realize he's blind okay I'm gonna make this easy for Dad but the Elder said is right the youngest has left and Jacob goes to give the blessing to them The Lion's Share belong to the firstborn the eldest but Jacob crosses his hands and he gives the Lion's Share to the younger son the two boys represented two churches the Orthodox Jewish church and a new church a younger church that would be born on the day of Pentecost a gentile bride I know we've been told that a woman represents the church in the Bible but now here are two boys represent churches two young boys it pleased God to write it this way to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent so that this morning he could reveal it to you that you could know that God can do anything he wants to do I've caught myself because the younger man saying no no God wouldn't do that who am I to say what God could do Brother David okay well he does whatever he wants almighty God don't Revelations 5 and 7. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the book was taken once and open to Israel Now by The Llama by the by the lion of the tribe of Judah now the book is being taken again it's really a ministerial change it's not redundant he's not he's not going to the same people twice the first time he went to Israel this time he's going to the Bride of Jesus Christ a gentile church and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne Revelations 5 20. the years 1963 A.D so between verse 6 and 7 once again is over 1900 Years and we're now in the 20th century he took the book is now February the 28 1963 on Sunset Mountain that's where it was opened Revelations 5 and 8. and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb every one of them having Harps and golden vials for the holders which are the prayers of the Saints Revelations 5 8 repeats again that he had taken the book because now it's March 17th 1963 and the lamb has once again opened the book revealing the seven seal book is open in Jeffersonville Indiana and we just read the quotes so between verse 7 and verse 8 is now only 17 days verse 9 of Revelations 5. and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation it's Revelations 5 9. and the years 2022. and the place is Dallas Fort Worth and the day is today think about it and the mystical body of Jesus Christ she sees it and is in a Revival of the just we are in a bright age some folks say no no brother Daniel there's only seven Church ages this isn't another church age this is a dimension where God wants you to live in while the rest of the world lives in laodicea and the mystical body of Jesus Christ she sees it and Sons and Daughters of God are saying Worthy is the Lamb Jesus Christ Our word Lord not worthy is the man Prophet Apostle teacher evangelist pastor but Worthy is the Lamb of God Jesus Christ Our Lord savior healer baptizer lion lamb king king of kings and Lord of lords turn with me once again to Revelations eight and one modern events made clear by prophecy Revelations 8 and 1. and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and that's all it said one short verse about this seventh seal or so we think it's just one verse about the seven seal but we'll find out shortly that there's a lot written in this Bible about the seventh seal in the message Christ is the mystery of God brother Branham speaking of his on his end time ministry how it was progressing and Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 6 37 he says he says now not knowing he says of course being spiritual he says you watch spiritual things not knowing this God Knows It But if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot to a clock the end of the second poll the third pull that is at hand a change a ministerial change was unfolding the third poll was the opening of those Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths had been sealed in the word let me read you what prophet said about that statement in the anointing ones at the end time paragraph 262. he says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second pole can prophesying third poll in the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed they're they're no no more there's no more higher order than to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of those Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he says do you see it what happened on Sunset Mountain Prophet tells us and what is attraction on the mountain paragraph 148 what's happened about on Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1-7 and in the days can the sounding of the seventh angel message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 and the last message to the last Church fulfills exactly in this age Saint Luke 17 30 the day when the son of man should be revealed and there shall rise false prophets and false christs show great signs and wonders in so much that deceived the elected if possible these are the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as puzzled 1965. June the 25th he says the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just a sponsored to all we don't want to be that church that's puzzled the prophet said I cannot over emphasize the need for revelation and Revelation is a personal experience with Jesus Christ the only thing that can hinder you from revelation the only thing that can hinder me is me let me say this that Revelations 10 was the seventh seal Revelations 10. was the seventh seal that means instead of just having one verse giving us details on the seventh seal now we've got 11 verses from chapter 10 of Revelations listen to this the Feast of the trumpets paragraph 264. look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this and I'm glad he took time to say one more thing because I want to say one more thing close enough don't miss this how striking from the seventh Angels messenger of the seven seal message can Revelation 10 was the seventh seal everything in Revelations 10. are details of events and happenings under the seven seal now we don't have just one verse in Revelations 8 1. now we've got 11 more now we've got 12 verses of detail concerning this seventh seal what is this seven seal part seven of one divine plan and of redemption salvation and God wanting to change him and prepare you for rapturing faith remember Isaiah 40. it was the prophecy of the first Forerunner of the first Elijah to the first coming of Christ and it was spoken in detail of his style of ministry and what he would do he said he'll make a road a path straight for our Lord he said he'll come and he'll fill all the valleys he'll come and he'll cut down all the mountains he'll come and he'll make every crooked thing straight he'll come can he'll make every rough thing smooth and I go to the New Testament and I can't find where he did any of those things and yet I know he did it so I keep searching say Lord what is this and I think make the road straight that's a change that's a big change fill every Valley that's a huge change cut down every mountain and make it plain that's a huge change that's a change bigger than any construction company would want to take on make every crooked thing straight that's a huge change make every rough Place everything's smooth another huge change it was five things and then I get and the Holy Spirit just quickly now did you get it okay the five things that John the Elijah Ministry was to come to do to bring to Israel number one change number two change number three change number four changed number five change he was bringing change this man from everything they believed the way they worship the way the father treated his children the way the mother spoke to the dad the way that mother spoke to her teenage girls changed changed change you gotta change it all now that he's come and he's come again to bring us change change how many can say just a whisper change Revelations 10 7 he says it was the seventh seal 1963 February 28th there appeared in a cloud in the heavens above I still remember the day I still remember a brother coming knocking on my dad's door he said you know just what just happened yesterday and he brought eight kind of a flyer from the University of Arizona the head of the science department there was a man named Jamesy McDonald and he wrote he wrote up a few pages on and the cloud picture and everything that we see in Life Magazine many of you have seen it and he wrote this an unusual cringe-shaped Cloud was widely observed over Northern Arizona near Sunset on the 28th of February 1963. from a large number of observers reports it is it is known to have appeared over near kedover Flagstaff Arizona from initial computations based on four photos taken in Tucson 190 miles south of the cloud and its altitude was approximately 35 kilometers the most distant observation reported was made 280 miles from the cloud the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes after local sunset the sun went down and the cloud remained illuminated for 28 minutes John told us and when the seventh seal was opened there was silence in heaven for about the space of a half hour God gave him that language they didn't have wrist watches then they didn't necessarily clock time as we clocked time John didn't even understand the statement he made because they didn't make no sense in the day that he lived about the space of a half hour what's that just ride it John but now we know science has collaborated and more specific it was exactly 28 minutes he said the cloud remains sunset for 28 minutes after local Sunset iridescence was noted by many absorbers tentatively the cloud may be regarded as similar to our narcritious Cloud but it's unusually great height unusually low altitude plus it's remarkable shape suggests it was a cloud of previously unrecorded type unrecorded of science but recorded in God's holy word in Acts 1 verse 7 to 11. let me read it for you and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnessed unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they look steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel in verse 9 we have no reason to believe that it was nothing more than a cloud and when he had spoken these things while they beheld him he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight and while they look steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up can be told behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus is taken up from you to heaven shall show shall shall come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven now we realize that this wasn't a cloud that took him up this was the same seven angels He said the way you've seen him go is the way you'll see him come again and he's come again in this day he came down the world still says an unusual cloud the prophet said no no no it was seven angels just look at the picture real closely and then turn it to the right and who is it it's Christ it's the Lamb of God it's Jehovah changing forms descending down for one purpose he wants to get closer to you Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Brockton them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts or precept must be upon precept precip upon precip line upon line line upon line here a little and they're little it's what we're sharing with you this morning line upon line here a little and there a little turn with me to Revelations 10 and verse 1. okay this chapter that a prophet said this is the seventh seal that details and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven glowed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it where the sun and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little bit open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the Earth when you see the cloud picture in Life Magazine um that's what took place here in Revelations 10 1. this Mighty angel came down the one with the swept back Wings he returned just as he had left the first time on that day just before Pentecost while they were in the going ordered them to go to the upper room and they seen him go in a cloud it wasn't just the cloud it was these seven angels once again and right here this is a nice salt another Mighty Angel come down from heaven close to the cloud and a rainbow upon his head I don't know if you've ever taken that Life Magazine it's almost to the end of the magazine where they placed it it's just one page the right little editorial notes on it and show the picture but immediately on the back side of that page was was another phenomenal event took place that they called the midnight rainbows it was a picture of a rainbow that appeared about 11 o'clock at night on one of the islands of Hawaii and a photographer it happened to be at the right place the right time with just the right photographic equipment to snap this picture of a rainbow that appeared at 11 o'clock at night eleventh hour and in this May issue of Life magazine 1963 they took both these pictures and put them back to back the rainbow and the picture of the cloud and when you lift up connect picture to the light you see the rainbow over the top of the cloud of seven angels what was it Revelations 10 1. what did Prophet say Revelation 10 was it was the seventh seal he says modern events being made clear by prophecy and the message 1965 this very same one by the same title from the Branham says this these modern events are slipping by us too swiftly and one day we're going to find out who will be left behind without nothing be caught shielding to the mark of the beast before we know it now and with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age 44 tells us the author has before done this and we wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year living can you look at God's Bible you see what age we're living in we're not living in a Methodist Baptist age we're living in the bright Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it so Revelations 10 now not only did he call it the seventh seal now Revelations 10 he's calling it The Bride age in the message this day the scriptures fulfilled brother Branham says this he says and I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to baptism in Jesus name and all these things has been revealed but there are secrets that's hid inside because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I must go there to find it he said and that morning when those seven angels came down and blasted the Earth and rocks through her seven angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from those angels told them to return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from do you know that statement isn't written in the Bible and yet he told us those angels tell them go back to Jeffersonville from where you come from did you ever wonder what John was prohibited to write could it be this how in the world you write Jeffersonville in Greek John didn't know what to write don't write it John because it's not your ministry because it's not this day because it's not the first coming it's the second coming it's the second Elijah it's a 20th century and when seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and a voice said to me don't write it John and folks say you see not even written don't even touch it don't go there but though it wasn't a written word it never ceased being the spoken word because once God speaks something it comes out of his mouth it will not return void to him what did he receive here A Spoken Word you can't find it in the Bible okay but we but God Vindicated what he said to him go back to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the Seven Seals the Mysteries will be open he says here we are today understanding serpency in a few days if God willing will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and all these things that God has opened every seal the mystery since the foundation of the world can we've been enjoying the presence of his Blessing that's true then he says this day this scripture is fulfilled it's 1965. it's February the 19th he's talking about Revelation standard the seventh seal he says this day this scripture is fulfilling revelation 10. it was his coming his second coming I know there's a great debate on his appearance coming that's for another day but here he says it's just coming let me read it to you from the breach 1963 verse paragraph 39 . he said thou it's real mysterious because no man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus Christ see now but he says but it is a book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probed that through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all those loose ends that those fellows probed it can the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God reveals the entire revelation of God then the godhead and everything else has settled all the Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed now the book is open but the revelation has to do with your personal experience with Jesus Christ has to do with obedience has to do when you go deeper with the baptism of the Holy Ghost has to do with refilling after refilling of that spirit it's now you see I'm not just making that up it's thus saith the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book The sounding of the seven things will miss you the mystery of God should be finished and that's been declared by his holy prophets and that's the prophets who was wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through this church has been probed at will be wound up together can when the seals are broke and the Mysteries reveal down comes the angel the messenger Christ he came down on Sunset Mountain setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea footprints means possession he was told to Israel wherever you put your foot he says I'll give it to you put Prince's possession this Angel come down in the in a time of redemption he put his foot on the land Israel he's coming down for Redemption he put his foot on the sea a multitude of people a gentile people a gentile bride he's coming down for Redemption one foot on the land Israel one foot on the sea a gentile bride he's coming down for Redemption that's what this seven seal was about seven seal it's still bothering you part seven of seven parts of one divine plan of redemption for you to be saved to be healed to be changed to be quickened by the power of the Holy Spirit to live a life worthy of the Gospel so what is revelation stand now the seventh seal what is Revelations 10 it's the time of the Bride age what is revelation 10 it's his coming what does revelation 10 when the Seven Seals of God were opened there on the mountain what is Revelations 10 it's the third pull in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ mother Branham says this because I said that Revelations 10 was when the Seven Seals of God were opened there on that mountain sunset Mountain an invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 301. President says this and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain and the Seven Seals of God when he was opened there in the mountain Seven Seals seven parts of one Divine Plan of Redemption to save you to heal you to restore you to take you back into his presence to leave it to live eternally with his family once again hmm he said and the Seven Seals of God when was it opened there on the mountain I thought it was opened in Jeffersonville no no they're on the mountain in Jeffersonville he began to bring the revelation of a book that was open he said then he says he said let God he said no no no let me die right now at this Pulpit if that ain't the truth 50 years and I foretold you here in six months before it happened what he told me go to Arizona what would happen out there in the desert can there's men sitting right here tonight was standing right there in prison when the Seven Angels Came Down the magazine Life Magazine packed the article of it it's right here in the observatory can everything now they don't even know what it's all about that was 60th November the 25th 1965. here we are November okay 2022. and they don't even know what it's all about yet but there's a little bride there's an elect people their sons and daughters of God who are meditating on his word day and night and God is revealing this book of redemption to them because it's open the cloud was photographed on February the 28th 1963 March the 17th 1963 William Branham begins the sounding of the seventh angel Ministry with God and simplicity March 24th he preaches the Seven Seals and 25 days have gone by so from the appearing of the cloud to the preaching of the Seven Seals was 25 days so from Revelations 10 1 to Revelations 10 7. is 25 days because in the last days he said I'll have to make it a quick short work prophecy sitting for thousands of years at the end time and God unfolds it and brings it to pass in 25 days sometimes because we read in Revelations 5 2 000 years can pass between one verse to the next but here seven verses in 25 days because the father says my children need me the daughters of Zion need it I've got to move fast to change them what did the first Elijah bring to Israel change what is the message of the second Elijah to bring to us change why he was going to change us from being Catholics to being Sons and Daughters of God we didn't have to go to a communion service in the morning they'd pop the bread in our mouth and they'd drink the wine to the David foreign Don finished no we can have a personal experience with Jesus Christ now Revelations 10 1-7 in 25 days in the first seal for the Branham says paragraph 195. now then reformers know there was something wrong Luther know that that the bread wasn't the body of Christ and so we preach the just shall live by faith and that was his message and when John Wesley came along he saw that there was sanctification so he preached sanctification that was his message see the Pentecostals brought in the message of the Holy Ghost and so forth well the brand called it the Pentecostal age but the Pentecostal age was really an overlap from the end of it was a movement that began in the age of Philadelphia rolled over into laodicea brother Branham called that the Pentecostal age it's when methodists in the middle of the 19th century and started reading their Bibles again those that believe the message of Wesley and they get to the book of Acts and they say wait a minute sanctification by the spirit I believe it brother John Wesley well what about this Holy Ghost that's being talked about in the Bible it was Methodist looking for more it brought about about what's called the Pentecostal movement and that's what brother brand called Pentecostal age it was really a movement partially in Philadelphia partially it wasn't another age it was just William Branham calling it an age so that he could hide it not William Branham God so he could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealing them to babes such as Woodland and the prophet said but in the last days the messenger is not to start any information but he should take all the Mischief those reformers left off gather them together solve them to the people let me just read it again oh it sounds so good I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothes of the cloud or rained upon his head if his face was the sun his feet his pillars of fire now we saw that same thing which was Christ he's talking about sunset Mountain can we know Christ is always the messenger to the church all right he's called the pillar of fire the angel of covenants forth can he had in his hand a little book opened now the seals had done been broke here he's talking about the prophecy Revelation Cinema he said now the seals had done been broke there he's preaching the first seals and then he says but we're breaking them right now he goes pin the vision in the prophecy the seals have done been broken he said I just read your Revelations 10 1 and then he goes oh yeah he says why we're breaking them right now in other words this day in Jeffersonville Indiana preaching the verse Seal these scriptures fulfilled Revelations 10 3 and 4. and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me seal up those things towards the seven Thunders uttered and write them not because the first thing the Thunder spoke was go back to Jeffersonville Indiana to open up those Seven Seals John was about to write it he said no don't write that first of all there's no Greek letters for Jeffersonville Indiana don't ride it but it remained the spoken word waiting to come down one date the turn of the 20th century the Thunder how many know that the Thunder was the voice of God when a seal opened in the first seal paragraph 263 brother Brown says it we found what that thunder means that's perfectly he says we know that see we all know that okay but he didn't stop there in case there was someone that didn't know it yet and he said the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened so what would seven Thunders be you do the math this morning Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about and questions and answers number four 1964 it's August but the RAM said they asked him a question has the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed and they were revealed in the Seven Seals but yet but are not yet known to us as the Thunders yet but the brand says no they were revealed in the sun Shields that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one can make out what it was John knew what it was but he's forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding that's a particular part of the ministry of the set of the seventh angel that was a ministerial change for this seventh angel okay because the seventh angel in the days of a sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed from the seventh angel is the messenger of the seven Church age see what is revelation 10 it's the Seven Seals what is Revelations 10 it's the bright age what is Revelations 10 it's his coming to the bride what is revelation 10 against the sounding of the seventh angel his third poem Ministry the revealing of the word what does Revelations 10 it's a heart-turning time it's not information not education Revelation a personal experience with a father made possible through the blood of Jesus Christ next position of the seven Church ages he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders and Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be this divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned our hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so he says but consider this also he says this Prophet Messenger will be in his nature and manners is where Elijah and John the people of this Prophet messenger's day will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's Kansas it's only the children whose Hearts will be turned pits only the children who will listen in the days of Ahab only 7 000 true Israelites were found in the days of John there were also very few the masses in both ages weren't fornication and idolatry as the masses today are in fornication and idolatry as Satan is trying to take you both young and old into fornication and idolatry but God rich in Mercy and the message is this a sign of the end time sir paragraph 314. he said brother Ram says now when he begins to sound speaking of the scripture in Revelations 10 7 the mystery will be finished now note then it's time for the seven seal voices of Revelations 10 to be revealed do you understand the congregation says amen when all the mysteries of the book was completed and the Bible said here that it would finish the Mysteries Revelations 10 it's the seventh seal in relation 10 it's the bright age Revelation 10 it says coming Revelation 10 it's when the Seven Seals was opened there on the mountain February the 28th 1963 Revelations 10 it's when the seventh angel began to sound March 18 1963. read when the revelations 10 verse 5 and 6 will be closing soon and the angel which I saw set upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to Heaven can swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and earth and the things therein and the and the earth and the things that are therein and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and the question rose up time ended with the preaching of those seals brethren no he says no no questions and answers 1964. paragraph 141 but I said if they ask him the question now if time ceases when the seals were open if time sees pardon me says when the seals were open then the Millennials also finish is it not no noises time didn't cease when the seals were open you misunderstood it what happened the Mysteries was revealed not time cease see watch real close now can we play your tape if you got it from a tape see but more and more we're getting quotes from each other and never going back to the table more and more before I get an interpretations and scriptures from each other never going back to the Bible go back and take the book from he that sat on the throne God wants to give you a personal experience with him he said no time never ceased this must be a post-millennius or something that's the question because we got a thousand years after church has gone home comes back upon the Earth then time ceases in the new heavens and in the new Earth he says and he says there will be there will still be sin after the Millennium the Millennium is a type of Noah going to the ark carried over brought ham and them onto the side and sin even come out of the Ark he says you see that Revelations 10 and 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets in the message I have heard but now I see brother Branham says this now we're promised the church age to reformers we've had them but he promised Malachi for he'd keep his pattern in the last days always watch the pattern of the word find the pattern in the word because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said he's he said he'd keep his pattern the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers for that very purpose can the church is so brought broke up in denominations as isn't it's so toward who pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared Revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message then he says not the healing service not the first pull not the sign in the hand not even the Discerning of the hearts of people that wasn't the sounding that wasn't the Fulfillment of verse 7. he said when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service not the evangelistical services okay in the message the rapture reached in 1965 it's December the 4th he's got another 20 days and God will be taking him home he says this now there's a messenger above always and a messenger on the earth the English word angel means a messenger and the seventh Angel's message while he was making is proclaiming his ministry then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and Afflicted oh the great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody wanted him in his church but when he sat down one day and said I and my father are one that was different that was different and except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in it Seven Seals they were preached on March the 17th 1963 beginning with God and simplicity it was ten services in eight days March the 24th of that same year 1963 preaches the seventh seal so from February the 28th 1963 to March the 24th 1963 is 25 days total from Revelations 10 1 to Revelations 10 7. fulfilled in 25 days you say no no don't hold it brother Daniel he couldn't do that he can do anything he wants he can put a comma and separate a sentence by over 2 000 years remember Malachi 4 6 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that was the first Forerunner John the Baptist comma and the hearts of the children back to the fathers second coming of Christ Akama separates the very same sentence by how much more than 2 000 years you can't read it by a book it's got to be Revelation you must be born again to read this book and understand it exactly you must be born again to read this book The Bible then it's easy because God reveals it to you and the message influence it's November the 30th 1963. and the prophet says this in paragraph 109. he said what did John the Baptist do the man that Jesus said there was never a man born of a woman like him or could compare with him until that time the great prophet ordained of God before the foundation of the world spoke of 1200 or 700 years before he ever come on or 712 years rather before he came to the Earth by the prophet Isaiah here what did he do when he seen a man come walking down out of the audience he looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven the form of a dove he cried out I have need to be baptized of Thee someone say Lord I have need to be baptized of Thee you don't need to leave this morning without a born-again experience you don't need to leave this morning without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and you don't need to leave this morning without a refilling I should cover everybody wherever you are in your Christian experience remember Sarah she laughed in the tent Elohim was outside the tent with his back to the tent he said why did Sarah laugh Sarah says no no I didn't laugh not out loud she didn't put in your heart he said no yes you did she believed in God she loved God but she no longer believed that God would use her to bring a son to pass she didn't believe that God could do it in her that was the problem I'm too old and it's too late for me was the first time she left but the second time she left she was holding the center arms who would ever have known that I've given to a child at 90 years old my husband a hundred so on the basis of that this morning I can discern where everyone is at in the Christian walk for the day every one of you is somewhere between the first laugh and God gives you the last laugh did I get it yeah brother Ram says the great prophet ordained of God before the foundation of the world spoke of 1207 years before he ever come or 712 years rather before he come to the Earth by the prophet Isaiah where did he do when he seen a man come walking down on the islands he looked up above and saw the fire coming down from heaven in the form of Dove he cried out I have need to be baptized in thee I must decrease he must increase God can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has the message you know then he says I must decrease and then he says it's 1963. it's November the end of the year then he says he is the messenger then he says this I've been up to this time November 1963. I've been up to this time now he takes my place as Elisha when Elijah went up throw back his robe on Elisha his ministry was finished Elijah must take up where he left off he must increase I must decrease he said it's the end of 1963. and a great Revelation strikes the prophet and he's realizing I must decrease and he Christ must increase in the hearts of the people because he said he says he is the messenger then he says I've been that messenger up to this time but now he is he says I must decrease like the first Elijah said I must decrease he must increase because it's all about Jesus Christ in you is your hope of Glory and deliverance and overcoming power after the Forerunner has left the scene who is the messenger follow the pattern of the Holy Spirit Christ in his bride Christ in you as he wasn't a prophet can you say but Daniel how can Christ be in me like he wasn't a prophet because he promised you he said I'll be in you I'll be with you even to the ends of the world okay it makes you what it made him a son of God the ministry part because that's something else but the sun part and the daughter part that's why he's coming for you that's where you came from Glory that's why he was changing form from God on the throne to the angel of the Covenant took on a body of Flesh as the Son of God then come back as the Holy Spirit walking in the midst of seven Church ages looking for his children Greg Jehovah Eagle spreading his wings looking for you this morning and what follows a ministerial change from a one-man Ministry to the ministry of a many-membered body follow the pattern okay when brother Branham died what'd they say I heard them with moan ears what are we going to do now what are we going to do now they said I was just a boy I said uh I don't know what about Jesus the author and finish of our faith Revelations 10 and 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again John speaking said go and take a little book which is open in the hand of the angel which angel the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth not the seventh angel he's off the scene he's gone many of you were born years after he passed away in 65. where do you get the book from now go back to him to that angel who's standing upon the sea and upon the Earth get a personal relationship have a personal experience with Jesus Christ and a prophet tried to convince us of that November of 63. he said he's the messenger I was up to this time he says but I must decrease in your eyes now and he must increase verse 9 of Revelations 10 and I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it and eat it up it shall make thy Valley bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took a little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it up my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings Revelations 10 1-11 what is it it was that seven seal it is the bright age okay it is his second coming to us Seven Seals it's seven parts of one Plan of Redemption for the bright tree and for the fig tree let me read you one last quote the message from Revelations chapter 5 1961 barbanum paragraph 100 he says this and this seven seal book of of seven Redemptive plans has been brought to us and that's what this book holds now we're going to get over in the 10th chapter with his mighty Angel Proclaim something can I add a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got into his belly it was bitter but his lips it was sweet see when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody telling you you're a Holy Roller you're this you're that you're off your head so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips that's all see when you stand up can I meet and you say glory to God hallelujah so when you're going through that great Siege it's hard but when you're out of that great seeds you can testify of it then it sweetened the lips see that's right this that's this book of redemption as we stand to our feet this morning Revelations 10. one to seven unfolded in 25 days you say but then what followed a continuation of William branham's third full ministry all the way to the time when God took him off the scene in 1965. um God rich in Mercy sent the Forerunner this in the second coming just like he did in the first coming to bring change to our lives at the second coming just like he did at the first the ministry of John five things were itemized so we could understand his ministry so we so people could catch it and then he would come and yet the way it was written no one caught it it had to be revealed that's why Jesus in Matthew 11. verse 24 25 26. it says father I thank you that you have hidden these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it unto babes such as would learn it comes right back to what Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born again unless unless a man be born again of the spirit of God he cannot see the kingdom of God Paul said the book of Ephesians Lord Open the Eyes of our understanding that we might see Jesus as we bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for a quick short work that you've begun for these seven parts of a Divine Plan of Redemption to save to redeem to change a bride a bright tree and a fig tree [Music] Lord you've kept your word every promise made has been a promised capital and this morning you said that if anyone would have need of you if there anyone lacked this born-again experience if anyone needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need only bow your head and ask and God will give it God will shower it down on you God will touch that or God will change you well that's why a prophet coming this day thank you to bring change to make a path straight for the Lord to fill every Valley to bring down every Mountain to make every rough spot smooth and every Crooked Road straight what was it every one of them was a great change change change change change the Holy Spirit was crying out to Israel and they couldn't take the change they couldn't make the turn they couldn't climb the mountain they wouldn't but this morning Lord may you have a people willing to him and saying Lord Jesus Jesus say I'll do it [Music] the prophet give a testimony of a man who has been real real accused because he carried his Bible everywhere he went and he was a blind man they said if the Bible told you to run through that solid wall would you do it he said I would do it if the Bible said it so that be foolish knows because when I get to the wall God would make a hole to go through [Music] I just gotta walk by faith and not by sight Lord God bless your children this morning for their attentiveness May the word go deep into their hearts [Music] may they become students at the feet of Jesus may they do that take the advice that was given to us anyone here want to know how to get closer to God just read your Bibles and pray every day it'll take you there it's the path Back to Eden it's a path back into his presence [Music] father we thank you this morning bless your people once again bless this church the ministry Brother David and all his helpers Lord we ask all this now in Jesus name amen God bless you all this morning thank you foreign [Music] I you know I don't want uh you to get confused in any way by our our brothers Ministry you know trying to show you the word of God all this was planned before the foundation of the world and it was spoken and I I thought this morning especially for our young people if you want to know why we have a message you know how that quote unquote the message came to pass it's because God sent a prophet and the prophet began to go out in three pools right taking people by the hand Discerning the thoughts and intents of the Heart And Then There came down a time where it came time to opening of the Seven Seals and when the prophet of God opened this Heaven seals like our brother said many of us weren't born yet but when he took that Authority that's when the church left them that's when everybody walked away but I thought it was amazing how how simple uh the Lord is and the Beautiful Things that he does when we open service we simply made this statement and today the very God that spoke of this age is on the scene doing exactly what he said he would do foreign can you imagine he was doing what he said he would do I wanted to put that quote up the one that our brother read uh it was out of um influence um and let me see if I can read it back there I can't he says I must decrease and he must increase God can't have two on the earth at the same time he said only one has the message you know I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to this time now he takes my place [Music] as Elijah when Elijah went up and throwed back his robe to Elijah his ministry was finished Eliza must take up where he left off he must increase I must decrease John the Baptist and and I I thought it was so beautiful this morning because the message has been spoken now who is it that's revealing this message to you it's not the man William Branham it's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself revealing his word to you next so you wonder the Holy Ghost you know the only person who can receive the Holy Ghost is the elect amen it's all election he's elected you he's chosen you to take this great gospel that he preached that we look back we look back every single one of us this morning is looking back on the ministry of William Branham we weren't there on the Ohio River but we believe it you say how do you believe it because I today in 1922 November 27th I believe it is I see the evidence of what was spoken coming to pass amen don't you [Music] but who's opening your eyes who's giving you the isab who's allowing you to see who's quickening your heart who's touching you who's wooing you who's who's dealing with your heart it's him it's him Amen brother random he he didn't decrease in our respect no he didn't re decrease in our eyes he is Authority didn't decrease the absoluteness of what he preached none of that that decrease he he gets all the honor bestowed on him that God bestowed upon him look he he's not here teaching you and explaining you now it's God Amen the Lord Jesus Christ himself taking you back to what he spoke through his prophet and revealing it to you isn't that wonderful so so you you know you have a personal relationship because you're seeing amen what he said I love that and I thought when I started this morning I says that's what I'm thankful for I'm thankful that I can see amen and believe what that he spoke and then our brother comes up wearing a vest I thought that was pretty cool right and and basically it takes this back and I'm saying don't get hung up in all the dates you know only certain people have that type of ability to comprehend those things but he's saying to me I saw this time I saw this I saw this look at it happen between here and here prophet of God said almost how many percent of the Bible was fulfilled and how many last hours yes turkey's just showing that to us but don't miss the big picture that is him revealing to you amen and that's the relationship that we want to be in we want to be in the relationship of God revealing his spoken word to our hearts at the end that's why we have a message amen we have a message because a man opened this Heaven's seals and said this is the word of God all that's finished this is the teaching this is the absolute he Vindicated it with signs and wonders and here we are this morning amen waiting for his coming Hallelujah are you waiting for the Rapture yes amen don't you feel it's close don't you feel if it's at hand amen I enjoyed that this morning I did I enjoyed the word I I enjoyed the the fact that all the scriptures is right on time amen amen God doesn't deal with the clock amen he don't have a calendar he's ever present every promise of God is present tense let me say that again every promise of God is present tense he's the same yesterday today and forever he's never changed everything that's happening here had already happened [Music] before there ever was a star before there was everything oh Church does that not make you feel secure it makes me feel like I'm wrapped up in his arms amen that I'm in the palm of his hands and nothing can pluck me out it makes me feel like my whole life even the hard times and the bitter times and the the sad times he knew all about it man he already made a way of Escape he already has my end finished you said how can that be I know that he's already gone to prepare a place for me [Music] and if I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you that where I am you may be also is that what you're resting in don't let's not let's not get caught up in the world Lord help me I'm trying to get the world out of my life I didn't know I had so much World in me it's kind of discouraging but I'm glad for Grace amen I'm
