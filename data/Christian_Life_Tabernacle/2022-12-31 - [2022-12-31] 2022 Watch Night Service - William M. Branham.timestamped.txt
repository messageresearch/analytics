[36:16] all
[36:18] truly truly wonderful to be here I look
[36:22] forward for this moment for about almost
[36:25] two years I would say that
[36:27] 20
[36:28] 20. 21 22 this is 22. all I've done is
[36:32] just work work as a bedside nurse and
[36:35] coming tomorrow or
[36:38] um it's it's a it's I was supposed to be
[36:40] working today
[36:42] and uh knowing that no one allows as a
[36:46] nurse to
[36:47] to take off and I says is it any way
[36:50] possible I can be taken off from work
[36:53] and
[36:56] I was not expecting that and within a
[36:58] second the email came or the text came
[37:00] that my shift is canceled and I'm here
[37:03] so that's number one
[37:06] so and
[37:11] it's okay to be scared the word says
[37:14] that he is not going to leave me and
[37:16] he's not going to forsake me I do not
[37:18] know what's coming I'm just excited for
[37:22] for for for tomorrow that's what I was
[37:24] telling my my co-workers you know like
[37:27] uh trade over my patients and uh if if
[37:32] you are in the in the state that you
[37:34] just do not know
[37:36] I just have a very peace what God has
[37:39] done for me on the cross of Calvary the
[37:41] fear of
[37:42] there is a fear but it's a it's a good
[37:45] fear I can just take this journey
[37:47] with the Lord with my Lord Jesus Christ
[37:50] and come whatever it may I'm ready 2023
[37:54] I'm ready
[38:01] mama
[38:03] if the Lord be for us who could be
[38:06] against us and I believe that's the
[38:08] excitement it's not necessarily just
[38:10] because we're changing a number on the
[38:12] calendar but oh my the expectation of
[38:15] the promise that is to come Amen to know
[38:18] that if 2022 is not the end then 20 2023
[38:22] if it didn't come in 2022 surely the
[38:25] next year that's how we live we don't
[38:26] wait oh I'll just wait until it shows up
[38:28] no it's the expectation if it's not
[38:31] today it's the next day amen that's how
[38:34] we live and amen who wants to go second
[38:37] amen there you go
[38:45] amen
[38:57] [Music]
[39:04] for me praise the Lord amen I've already
[39:08] told God but I can never thank me enough
[39:11] my family this year we have two crashes
[39:15] and all our cars are gone but you need
[39:18] to always thank God
[39:19] I can never thank him enough the last
[39:22] one happened I closed from work um
[39:24] Tuesday morning
[39:27] I meanwhile that's that's last week
[39:30] Tuesday
[39:31] previous week I worked on my car went
[39:35] for inspection he passed inspection I
[39:36] spent so much money fixing that car
[39:39] and when Daddy will go to work on on
[39:42] Monday I didn't go to work on Sunday so
[39:44] on Monday night I went to work on my way
[39:48] I climbed just about a mile from my work
[39:50] I climbed it
[39:52] cross over there like you know the kind
[39:55] of bridges they have here is so scary
[39:57] suddenly I don't know what it's not
[39:59] devil demons he puts something under the
[40:02] car because that is spinning
[40:04] I say really Jesus Jesus Jesus he was
[40:08] turning me turning me I thought I was
[40:09] flying over the bed I said Jesus Jesus
[40:12] Jesus he just turned and face the other
[40:14] side and boom they really I opened I
[40:17] strapped my belt I came out I was just
[40:19] looking at the car I said look I know
[40:21] you have failed as usual
[40:24] for real he has failed and will always
[40:26] fail because he that is in me is greater
[40:30] than his that is what he that collect is
[40:33] faithful and complete what he has
[40:34] started I know that he is that Source
[40:37] through this year oh
[40:40] within one week through a brother God
[40:42] made a way I got a better car
[40:45] it's a miracle and it will conclude to
[40:48] share the miracle we don't know what
[40:49] tomorrow holds but here that host
[40:52] tomorrow I know he is going to take us
[40:54] through tomorrow this journey is getting
[40:56] tougher than ever but he promised he
[41:00] needs all he'll make a wealth escape and
[41:02] I've seen his hand at all three points
[41:04] of my life
[41:06] my brother was talking about nurses we
[41:08] go to work and cry every day
[41:10] especially when they put me in that
[41:12] cancer world I talked about that stop
[41:14] you put me there evidently crying I
[41:16] can't stand it people going like this
[41:19] cooling down rats before me under my
[41:22] watch I keep praying some of them will
[41:24] hold my hands say please pray for me can
[41:26] you pray for me I said we pray just
[41:28] believe
[41:29] we kept working at some of them will say
[41:32] if there's God why didn't he come I said
[41:34] you know what I'm not about to discuss
[41:35] this
[41:36] since you know they are God that cannot
[41:38] help you I can't help you either I can't
[41:41] because I can't help myself I've always
[41:42] told them that look I have no confidence
[41:45] with this word including myself because
[41:47] they cannot offer me anything but I
[41:49] thank the Lord Jesus Christ who has
[41:51] brought us to this journey
[41:52] he doesn't do halfway job Brethren let's
[41:55] keep going keep marching on a lot of
[41:57] Trials on the way a lot of struggles the

[42:04] be noticed but then who is it that's
[42:06] called Jesus has called he has never
[42:09] failed any battle and he will never fail

[51:30] I wanted to give a testimony in regard
[51:33] to an accident
[51:35] like I as Liza said I I I I held myself
[51:43] God made it so that the sister was over
[51:45] there can come and give a test
[51:47] I felt a condemnation Within Myself
[51:51] I could have not went back in peace like
[51:54] that
[51:56] I said even if by the Billy doesn't ask
[51:59] I'm gonna lift my hands
[52:02] and that's what I did before I even
[52:04] asked
[52:05] before I can get to the testimony
[52:12] you know when by predestination what God
[52:15] chose you
[52:17] may whether people want it like it or
[52:20] not
[52:22] they cannot do anything against it

[52:30] my dad passed away when I was young I
[52:33] was about 11 years old
[52:37] he was poisoned because there were
[52:39] conflict of power
[52:41] he
[52:42] went to a church
[52:47] and they were supposed to take everybody
[52:49] from the family over today
[52:52] so they could see if there was a problem
[52:54] in the family
[52:56] when I presented myself
[53:00] with my family
[53:03] I see a man stand out
[53:07] loud
[53:08] never find me I was about nine and a
[53:11] half years old I was about around nine
[53:13] and a half years old
[53:16] it was a preacher who said this
[53:19] he took me by the hand
[53:21] he talked to everybody else
[53:59] just keep the details aside
[54:02] and then after that my my father passed
[54:05] away
[54:07] everywhere I went it was about the same
[54:10] when I meet someone
[54:14] who was given to Witchcraft
[54:17] even though they were family members
[54:20] they were always chasing me they didn't
[54:24] want my presence near them
[54:26] I didn't know what to do
[54:29] I became uh almost uh sad
[54:33] University the first year I was supposed
[54:36] to go to university
[54:38] on the first day that I went
[54:41] it's the same day that I believe in the
[54:43] Lord
[54:44] before that
[54:46] I I started feeling a heat
[54:53] it was it was something that was
[54:55] troubling for me
[54:58] but today I said amen to this message
[55:07] everything became normal
[55:10] I came to understand
[55:13] it was the pill of fire that was
[55:15] protecting me
[55:17] in 2017
[55:21] we were coming back from
[55:25] we went to visit the family someone

[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:04] with my brother Andrew everyone
[1:13:07] has some of our local ministers just
[1:13:09] come and say a few words up here
[1:13:12] certainly
[1:13:13] I know the New Years means so much to us
[1:13:16] and
[1:13:17] man we just want uh
[1:13:20] to reflect on the year that passed and
[1:13:23] and put it in perspective
[1:13:26] for the year that is to come amen
[1:13:28] so pretty Andre if you could just say to
[1:13:30] you God bless you
[1:13:35] praise the Lord
[1:13:38] well since everybody's given a testimony
[1:13:41] I
[1:13:43] God has done so much
[1:13:45] you know and it's
[1:13:47] you know when you think about it it's
[1:13:49] hard to isolate it down and just reduce
[1:13:52] it down but
[1:13:53] one thing I can say as a testimony is
[1:13:57] what I have what I've experienced is by
[1:14:00] the grace of God
[1:14:02] and what's so amazing about his grace is
[1:14:06] what he's done for us
[1:14:08] to this point he's going to continue to
[1:14:10] do
[1:14:11] you know and that Grace
[1:14:13] what's so wonderful about it is
[1:14:16] you know we've accepted
[1:14:18] the hand of the Potter and we're a
[1:14:22] people that are just upon the potter's
[1:14:24] wheel and we can hold to it because
[1:14:26] there's Grace isn't that wonderful
[1:14:29] you know I was thinking about you know
[1:14:32] just
[1:14:33] I don't know how it happened but about
[1:14:36] two months ago I did something to my
[1:14:39] shoulder and it may have happened while
[1:14:41] I was asleep but my arm became useless
[1:14:45] when it had like a trigger or something
[1:14:47] and so it would just go completely dead
[1:14:50] and I couldn't really lift it and it
[1:14:52] would be like a real sharp stabbing pain
[1:14:55] and you know I need my arm for work
[1:14:58] you know and aren't you grateful that
[1:15:01] God he's promised to supply our needs
[1:15:05] so I don't have to fear though I
[1:15:07] couldn't use my arm and you just imagine
[1:15:10] it just happened at random times and it
[1:15:13] affected me for like almost a whole
[1:15:15] month but you know by God's grace you
[1:15:17] see
[1:15:18] God's power is still the same
[1:15:21] you know
[1:15:23] I can testify to you over and over and
[1:15:27] over again but see there are things that
[1:15:30] happen upon the believer are not by
[1:15:32] chance
[1:15:34] you know otherwise it would be God being
[1:15:37] a god of frustration but every single
[1:15:40] thing that we go through there's a
[1:15:42] purpose
[1:15:43] and it's not just for us
[1:15:46] but it's for the whole community that we
[1:15:49] reach to you know and and just just from
[1:15:53] the standpoint of maybe uh just looking
[1:15:56] forward to what the Lord's placed on my
[1:15:59] heart I just had a a little scripture
[1:16:01] maybe we could just stand for a moment
[1:16:03] and I'll have you turn with me just a
[1:16:06] quick scripture reading
[1:16:07] and um
[1:16:10] you know
[1:16:12] it was something that I thought was so
[1:16:15] wonderful but in Luke chapter 18
[1:16:18] in verse
[1:16:20] Luke chapter 18 and verse
[1:16:24] um
[1:16:35] so it was the parable of the
[1:16:38] the unjust judge and there
[1:16:42] um
[1:16:43] in verse 7 it says
[1:16:46] or let's back up to six it says and the
[1:16:49] Lord said hear what the unjust judge say
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:54] and shall not God avenge his own elect
[1:16:57] which cry day and night unto him though
[1:17:01] he bear along with them I tell you that
[1:17:04] he will avenge them speedily
[1:17:06] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:17:09] shall he find faith on the earth amen
[1:17:13] you may have your seats I just you know
[1:17:17] I I you know we had a wonderful trip to
[1:17:20] Romania and God miraculously made made a
[1:17:24] way for me in such a short time to to be
[1:17:27] able to just lay it lay aside
[1:17:31] um now this is a miracle for me because
[1:17:33] I had preconceived that I was gonna
[1:17:36] um you know have a schedule with work
[1:17:37] and things like that and so I was able
[1:17:40] to just
[1:17:41] put all of that to the side
[1:17:43] and um there's a lot of mental battles
[1:17:47] that I had to go through just even to
[1:17:49] just let go and just trust the Lord on
[1:17:52] that and and what it
[1:17:56] kind of jumping ahead but you know Faith
[1:17:59] the question is is will I find faith in
[1:18:03] the earth when I come
[1:18:05] you know and and we know that there's
[1:18:08] just a deep desire that we want to do
[1:18:11] what's pleasing to the Lord isn't that
[1:18:13] our testimony like there's a deep
[1:18:16] calling out I want and and really for
[1:18:19] the believer the only thing that really
[1:18:20] satisfies is knowing that you're doing
[1:18:22] the will of God
[1:18:23] right and so
[1:18:26] I just came to a place where I realized
[1:18:28] it's going to take God to work out
[1:18:30] everything and he miraculously did that
[1:18:34] and I ended up making a phone call to uh
[1:18:38] to the phone company and said hey I'm
[1:18:41] going to be traveling to Romania and I
[1:18:42] need I need to be able to communicate
[1:18:44] when I get there you know I need to have
[1:18:46] phone service and so my company the I
[1:18:50] use a local company and they're like
[1:18:52] well we have a third party that we use
[1:18:54] that you can buy minutes while you're
[1:18:56] away and so I go okay so I go over there
[1:18:58] and uh it's not working and I paid it
[1:19:02] just this is ten dollars not a big deal
[1:19:03] but they they sold me something that
[1:19:06] didn't exist you know it was calls from
[1:19:09] here to there not from there to here and
[1:19:12] so I was like Wow and so when I came
[1:19:14] back I was kind of like man what a bum
[1:19:16] deal you know I didn't have any ability
[1:19:18] to call back home or anything unless I
[1:19:21] had Wi-Fi hook up you know and and it
[1:19:24] just struck me that
[1:19:26] you know as I was making the phone call
[1:19:28] to my phone company I was kind of like
[1:19:30] this is this is a bad deal while I was
[1:19:33] there if I was really depending on that
[1:19:35] service it would have been a complete
[1:19:37] failure you know
[1:19:39] and so thank God you know brother
[1:19:41] Matthew has a good you know phone
[1:19:43] connection so anything I needed really
[1:19:45] was was available that way but so then
[1:19:48] uh I'm on the phone with somebody just
[1:19:51] kind of complaining like hey I'm
[1:19:52] considering moving to another phone
[1:19:54] company and all this kind of stuff well
[1:19:57] as I'm talking to him you know the guy
[1:19:59] asked me my name and different things
[1:20:00] like that and getting the information
[1:20:02] and so then he's like I'm terribly sorry
[1:20:04] but and then he explains to me that
[1:20:06] actually wasn't a service they provided
[1:20:08] they're going to refund me the money but
[1:20:10] it just so happens that the man said
[1:20:12] something that triggered something and
[1:20:14] all of a sudden we're talking about God
[1:20:16] and all of a sudden the man he's saying
[1:20:19] that God supernaturally touched him in
[1:20:21] his heart and and he said there's a
[1:20:23] presence that I just I can't explain to
[1:20:26] you but it's so real and and even as we
[1:20:29] talked I think I was on the phone for
[1:20:31] with him for 30 minutes and it was so
[1:20:33] special to me you know isn't that
[1:20:36] something that you want you want
[1:20:38] leadership you want God to reveal his
[1:20:41] will to you
[1:20:42] you want you want revelation so that you
[1:20:44] can do what's pleasing to him not only
[1:20:46] just be a blessing you know be blessed
[1:20:50] but to be a blessing to somebody else
[1:20:51] and I thought was so wonderful the man
[1:20:54] even he mistakenly called me Angelo and
[1:20:56] I guess in his tongue that means Angel
[1:20:58] and so I'm just like you know God is so
[1:21:01] special to touch people's lives that
[1:21:04] we're in contact with and here I was
[1:21:06] thinking oh this could be something kind
[1:21:07] of frustrating
[1:21:09] um but yet to see how all of these
[1:21:14] things they're pre-planned by God
[1:21:16] your life is your your your life has
[1:21:19] been pre-planned by God and so
[1:21:22] as we were going through the trip and
[1:21:24] different things I I began to realize
[1:21:26] how much God really orders our steps
[1:21:30] you know the the things that we endure
[1:21:32] the things that we've gone through
[1:21:34] God he's going to have some Overcomers
[1:21:38] and so every situation that we go
[1:21:40] through we don't have to fear
[1:21:43] God's bringing something out of us an
[1:21:47] expression of him
[1:21:49] you know and so it's it's my desire to
[1:21:51] to yield more to that and you know I I
[1:21:54] thought it was real special and you know
[1:21:57] to think that you know the question that
[1:22:01] spurred on in our conversation is you
[1:22:03] know because a lot of people in the
[1:22:05] world they they have experience with the
[1:22:07] word of God they know the Bible and it's
[1:22:09] intellectual and some of it you know
[1:22:11] some is pure and genuine but you know
[1:22:14] the the faith that God's looking for is
[1:22:16] the revelation of this hour
[1:22:18] you know and to think that you know when
[1:22:21] you look at this unjust judge and this
[1:22:23] attitude
[1:22:24] you know it's like okay consider what
[1:22:28] this unjudged though he didn't fear God
[1:22:31] though he didn't regard man because this
[1:22:34] woman kept persistently doing it I'm
[1:22:36] just gonna give it to her and so this
[1:22:39] this this story is connected will I find
[1:22:43] faith when I return
[1:22:45] and I was listening before we left
[1:22:47] something that the Lord dealt with my
[1:22:49] heart and and and I believe there's
[1:22:51] leadership in this message
[1:22:53] I believe there's personal leadership
[1:22:55] when we go into prayer we look to the
[1:22:57] word of God and we just let the Lord
[1:23:00] lead us you know and something
[1:23:02] you know I really believe with all my
[1:23:04] heart the way we serve God is to serve
[1:23:07] his people
[1:23:08] and so uh somebody had you know I was
[1:23:12] fellowshipping with somebody and and
[1:23:14] that's just I was pouring my heart out
[1:23:16] to this person and I said you know
[1:23:17] that's and so then you know how it is
[1:23:21] sometimes you want to go check yourself
[1:23:22] with what the prophet said do you ever
[1:23:24] feel like that
[1:23:26] you know I just want to make sure I
[1:23:28] don't want to lead nobody astray
[1:23:31] I want to make sure that things that are
[1:23:33] coming out of my mouth are the faith of
[1:23:35] this hour
[1:23:36] and so
[1:23:38] I go back and I'm looking and you know
[1:23:40] he says it a lot you know but this one
[1:23:42] message he said was in a message called
[1:23:44] law 1955. and so as I'm listening to it
[1:23:47] he's just in the introduction of the
[1:23:49] tape and it's just going on and he's
[1:23:51] talking about a healing service and
[1:23:53] different things and then all of a
[1:23:54] sudden you know he begins to uh
[1:23:57] excuse me
[1:24:03] so he begins to share a
[1:24:05] uh how that after a service he remembers
[1:24:09] there was a
[1:24:11] there was somebody that said hey will
[1:24:14] you pray for my baby sister and sometime
[1:24:16] it passed and
[1:24:18] he said that he ended up hearing this uh
[1:24:22] and I don't know if it was a tug on his
[1:24:24] heart or if he was an audible voice but
[1:24:26] he said something about an infant baby
[1:24:27] and it kept it kept on him you know
[1:24:31] isn't that how the Lord healed just put
[1:24:33] something on you like a little burden or
[1:24:35] you'll seem like I gotta go search this
[1:24:37] out and there's so many things that can
[1:24:39] get in the way to hinder us from
[1:24:42] searching that out
[1:24:44] you know I find for me it was like
[1:24:46] seeing what the prophet did is like he
[1:24:49] didn't just push it off to the side you
[1:24:52] know like to really find like a passion
[1:24:55] to go and see each other you know if
[1:24:57] someone really wanted gold and then
[1:24:59] there was another gold rush they would
[1:25:02] press past a lot of other things and go
[1:25:04] search it out they'll look for the
[1:25:06] treasure
[1:25:07] but the thing is is we know that we
[1:25:10] can't please God except It Be by faith
[1:25:12] and Faith cometh by hearing and what
[1:25:15] what have I been doing spending all my
[1:25:18] time doing a lot of other things that I
[1:25:20] hold this value
[1:25:22] but yet there's there's a a treasure
[1:25:26] Trove a storehouse and so as I was
[1:25:29] listening to this um this sermon it
[1:25:32] really struck me how persistent that
[1:25:35] brother Branham was he didn't just pass
[1:25:37] this voice that was saying about this
[1:25:39] infant baby and so he searched it out he
[1:25:42] went through the books and he was like
[1:25:43] okay there was a prayer request for the
[1:25:46] a baby that had you know cancer in the
[1:25:49] eyes and he was searching it out and
[1:25:51] then
[1:25:52] seemed like he didn't let it up he
[1:25:54] didn't let go of it this was pressing
[1:25:56] him and how many times are we guilty am
[1:25:59] I guilty of just passing it up you know
[1:26:01] and so but this perseverance that he
[1:26:05] showed in this in this message it just
[1:26:08] was striking my heart
[1:26:10] and so he ends up
[1:26:13] you know he ended up following through
[1:26:15] and it turns out that
[1:26:18] he ends up finding out that there was a
[1:26:21] um he remembered whose voice it was that
[1:26:24] said remember my sister my little baby
[1:26:26] sister and he said that's uh such and
[1:26:29] such he even had the name and so he then
[1:26:32] he looks up in the phone book or
[1:26:33] something it calls uh the uh the certain
[1:26:37] uh dad or Pastor or something but there
[1:26:40] was so many steps that he had to finally
[1:26:43] get to and then
[1:26:45] he's on the phone with somebody in the
[1:26:47] hospital and this baby had been given up
[1:26:49] for like 10 or 11 days it was
[1:26:52] unconscious all this kind of stuff but
[1:26:55] now he in prayer now he he knows and he
[1:26:58] call and they make contact and then he
[1:27:00] shows up after you know so many hours of
[1:27:03] prayer and different things and it was
[1:27:05] just amazing and so I'll share this
[1:27:08] because
[1:27:09] you know I think it's special whenever
[1:27:11] the Lord does stuff like that and then
[1:27:14] for brother Branham to make a comment
[1:27:16] afterwards I just thought it was so
[1:27:18] exceptional
[1:27:19] and so
[1:27:25] you know he said it's it's better to
[1:27:27] follow the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:29] and this is after a great Victory
[1:27:31] because he was led of the Holy Spirit he
[1:27:34] says if we Christians would only quiet
[1:27:37] ourselves see not be so much as
[1:27:40] unrushing quieten ourselves
[1:27:43] one call from the Lord means more than
[1:27:46] ten thousand of our human efforts
[1:27:49] you know and and I just think that that
[1:27:51] affected that one uh baby's life and the
[1:27:55] testimony was special
[1:27:57] and it's just an encouragement to me to
[1:28:00] know that you know in this next up and
[1:28:03] coming year
[1:28:05] I believe that you know we're drawing
[1:28:08] closer to that time
[1:28:10] and you know our Victory is the faith
[1:28:15] right and oh to overcome how can we
[1:28:18] overcome
[1:28:19] we're going to have perfect faith and so
[1:28:22] you know I I believe that God's waiting
[1:28:25] to see us and and this is the other
[1:28:28] thing too
[1:28:30] and this is kind of personal because
[1:28:32] when I looked at leaving to Romania and
[1:28:35] hearing this testimony and just seeing
[1:28:37] the hand of God leading me
[1:28:39] through the different messages and in
[1:28:41] prayer
[1:28:43] I realized what the devil has been
[1:28:44] trying to do for a while with me and I
[1:28:47] know he's doing it with you is he's
[1:28:49] trying to rob us of our sacrifice
[1:28:53] you know and and Faith you know if you
[1:28:56] don't have love mixed in with your
[1:28:58] service and your Works God can't use it
[1:29:02] and so you know
[1:29:04] it's the love of God that shed abroad in
[1:29:07] our heart to go to do the will of the
[1:29:10] Lord is to go and serve God's people and
[1:29:13] so I I realize that part of the spirit
[1:29:17] of this age is they're rich and
[1:29:20] increased with goods and have need of
[1:29:22] nothing and that's always battering
[1:29:25] against us go get more be more do this
[1:29:29] do that and it's pressing us and it's
[1:29:32] trying to draw us and to get our eyes
[1:29:35] looking for the next feel good
[1:29:38] but I just believe that there's times
[1:29:41] the times coming where we're willing to
[1:29:44] sacrifice all because we want to do
[1:29:46] what's pleasing to the Lord and I'll say
[1:29:49] this from from my heart I I realize you
[1:29:53] know
[1:29:54] we we know that when we do something for
[1:29:57] the Lord and it's even just for one Soul
[1:30:00] you know it'd be worth it all and I've
[1:30:03] come to realize that you know like the
[1:30:06] scripture says here
[1:30:07] in um John chapter 8.
[1:30:11] you know Jesus made this statement he
[1:30:13] said in verse 29 he says and he sent
[1:30:17] and he that sent me is with me and the
[1:30:21] father hath not left me alone for I do
[1:30:24] always that which please him
[1:30:26] you know what a testimony and that same
[1:30:29] spirit is in you
[1:30:31] so the potential is in you to do that
[1:30:34] very same thing I do nothing except what
[1:30:37] pleases the father
[1:30:38] and so I just believe that there's
[1:30:40] something within us to sacrifice
[1:30:43] everything that we will do what's
[1:30:45] pleasing to him and so I'm looking
[1:30:47] forward to this new year and I'm going
[1:30:49] to persevere I know you're going to
[1:30:52] persevere because you know the devil
[1:30:54] trying to rob Moses and then to leave
[1:30:57] the sacrifice behind
[1:30:59] you know but really more than anything I
[1:31:03] want to do what's pleasing to the Lord
[1:31:04] and I believe what's pleasing to the
[1:31:06] Lord is not just having family going to
[1:31:09] work doing school that's just the
[1:31:12] background of what God wants us to do
[1:31:14] but I believe that God wants us to
[1:31:16] worship Him in spirit and in truth I
[1:31:20] want I believe that what God's looking
[1:31:22] for us is that his very spirit and his
[1:31:25] very life can do the very same Works he
[1:31:27] did when he was here amen
[1:31:30] that's my expectation
[1:31:32] that's our hope
[1:31:34] praise God
[1:31:36] the Lord bless you
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:48] praise the Lord
[1:31:50] and Manny if we can have that
[1:31:52] expectation every day when we work up
[1:31:54] you know the prophet will say that it
[1:31:57] seems like we do so much talking and
[1:31:59] very little listening
[1:32:01] you know we do all the talking and
[1:32:04] sometimes we expect God in the Thunders
[1:32:07] and then all of those things and in the
[1:32:10] shout and the emotion but most the time
[1:32:12] he's in the still Small Voice because
[1:32:15] when he comes there that he's speaking
[1:32:17] the truth you know the emotion can carry
[1:32:19] out all kinds of things but there's
[1:32:21] still Small Voice well directory that's
[1:32:23] leadership right there amen sister
[1:32:27] yessenia has a testimony if she could
[1:32:29] come at this time
[1:32:39] amen praise God
[1:33:04] huh
[1:33:10] sorry
[1:33:14] God bless you
[1:33:19] Isa I'm really nervous
[1:33:28] I'm a testimony
[1:33:32] I'm a miracle of God
[1:33:36] when I came to this country
[1:33:41] I didn't want to know nothing about God
[1:33:46] my sister knows God from a really long
[1:33:49] time
[1:33:50] I always judge her
[1:33:54] when I came here
[1:33:57] torno
[1:33:59] my life turned
[1:34:02] it was really difficult
[1:34:06] having a beautiful family
[1:34:11] her husband the only Gods Know
[1:34:14] why he put it in my pathos
[1:34:18] two beautiful children
[1:34:22] doesn't let you see
[1:34:26] is
[1:34:27] the lord always has a purpose
[1:34:31] and I Want To Praise Him Now
[1:34:36] is when you know
[1:34:38] everything that he keeps you from
[1:34:44] the Lord put my cousin that I knew this
[1:34:47] message
[1:34:49] to live in my house
[1:34:54] I live a terrible life
[1:35:00] the Lord got me out of places terrible
[1:35:06] he saved me from Three wrecks
[1:35:09] we're two cars
[1:35:14] and nothing happened to me
[1:35:17] Prima
[1:35:19] thank to God that I had a cousin
[1:35:22] every day I came in the
[1:35:25] uh in the morning

[1:35:42] everything is fine
[1:35:46] to summarize

[1:35:56] that place

[1:36:10] and God save me

[1:36:36] I am a miracle of those
[1:36:42] I thank God I could come to this message
[1:36:52] because I remember when I came here
[1:36:57] my crazy boy came here on Wednesday
[1:36:59] afterwards

[1:37:05] they only love me eat
[1:37:08] porque
[1:37:12] and now we have to thank God I'm here
[1:37:15] walking
[1:37:18] the enemy put a lot of things in my mind
[1:37:26] there's a lot of circumstances and
[1:37:28] problems in the way
[1:37:31] one of them it was the I'm not worthy
[1:37:34] to have a kid
[1:37:38] uh
[1:37:39] four losses
[1:37:44] but the lord gave me my Miracle
[1:37:48] one day I came to the altar with a
[1:37:51] pastor lady
[1:37:54] I told him I tried all I could
[1:37:58] but I'm not worthy
[1:38:02] something is wrong with me
[1:38:05] all the wrong I have done
[1:38:08] community you is living with my children
[1:38:14] and the pastor told me
[1:38:16] I never forget no no
[1:38:20] say no more
[1:38:22] yeah
[1:38:24] and love the Lord with all your heart
[1:38:30] then I went to my closet
[1:38:33] Senor I told them I know I feel you
[1:38:39] foreign foreign
[1:38:57] I want him with all my heart
[1:39:00] and there's David
[1:39:05] impossible for him
[1:39:11] and I wanna glorify him
[1:39:14] and I want to thank the Lord
[1:39:18] I know I'm not what right what I hear in
[1:39:22] the preachers
[1:39:25] but I know I'm not what I used to be
[1:39:27] because
[1:39:29] he will finish it
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:44] man I think sometimes we forget that
[1:39:46] it took a miracle for each one of you to
[1:39:49] be in this room
[1:39:51] here's a miracle working God
[1:39:54] amen he will go to the end of the Earth
[1:39:56] Amen to bring you to his fold amen
[1:39:59] amen we're happy to have our pastor and
[1:40:02] vitamin this time
[1:40:04] to come and say a few words
[1:40:29] God bless you tonight
[1:40:32] I guess they're starting to shoot off
[1:40:34] fireworks
[1:40:36] um
[1:40:37] they don't know there's a fire to come
[1:40:40] and we're working not to be there
[1:40:44] amen I I didn't want to I don't have a
[1:40:47] lot of strength but I I just wanted to
[1:40:49] share this evening with you I'd just
[1:40:52] like to read a couple scriptures so they
[1:40:54] could put it on the board
[1:40:56] and I hope this is all of our
[1:40:59] attitude
[1:41:02] when I read the scriptures a lot I look
[1:41:04] for the attitude
[1:41:06] that the person has
[1:41:08] the approach
[1:41:10] the way that they're going forward
[1:41:14] um
[1:41:16] how that they go forward
[1:41:18] when adversity comes
[1:41:21] When Trials come
[1:41:24] when the enemy rages
[1:41:28] you still got to go forward
[1:41:31] and you've got to have a way that you go
[1:41:34] forward
[1:41:35] you might want to call it an approach
[1:41:38] or something
[1:41:40] and I want to go forward as a church
[1:41:43] don't you I think that
[1:41:46] we long to see the supernatural
[1:41:50] that we have in our midst go beyond
[1:41:53] these walls
[1:41:54] and go out to a world that really needs
[1:41:57] it
[1:41:59] you know we don't know how many lives
[1:42:02] are affected when people ask us to pray
[1:42:05] form but I'd like to read here in
[1:42:09] Philippians
[1:42:11] the third chapter
[1:42:14] and it's a beautiful chapter I'd like to
[1:42:16] have read it all but I just want to
[1:42:18] start
[1:42:20] with the 13th verse
[1:42:23] talking about our attitude
[1:42:27] for the new year
[1:42:29] and
[1:42:31] we always use the new year as
[1:42:34] a time to drive a stake and to say that
[1:42:38] we're going to make things different
[1:42:41] and of course we don't believe in
[1:42:43] turning new leaves we believe in living
[1:42:47] new lives
[1:42:49] but I I love Paul's approach here and I
[1:42:52] just would like this to be our
[1:42:55] approach for the New Years
[1:42:58] brethren
[1:43:00] I count not myself
[1:43:04] to have apprehended
[1:43:08] but this one thing I do
[1:43:13] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:43:17] reaching forth unto those things which
[1:43:22] are before
[1:43:24] and I believe there's something before
[1:43:26] us
[1:43:29] we haven't apprehended it
[1:43:31] we haven't achieved it
[1:43:34] but I'm going to leave those things
[1:43:36] which are behind behind
[1:43:41] especially the things that
[1:43:43] I wish I'd never done or I wish I would
[1:43:47] have never said
[1:43:48] because they're never going to do me any
[1:43:50] good
[1:43:52] my failures cannot be in the building
[1:43:55] I'm going to build tomorrow
[1:43:58] it can't be part of the material
[1:44:01] that's got to be in my mind
[1:44:04] to approach
[1:44:06] the battle
[1:44:07] in athletes and great Sportsmen and
[1:44:12] great uh
[1:44:14] people who have achieved things in the
[1:44:17] athletic and different Realms they've
[1:44:20] always said one thing you've got to
[1:44:22] leave what you just did behind
[1:44:26] one of the Great
[1:44:28] baseball picture pictures made this
[1:44:32] statement one time I never let the last
[1:44:35] pitch I threw ever affect the pitch that
[1:44:39] I'm going to throw
[1:44:41] so when we come to this time I believe
[1:44:45] it's time that we sure we haven't
[1:44:48] apprehended we haven't achieved
[1:44:51] everything that we want it to be
[1:44:53] uh there's things that we don't like but
[1:44:58] there's one thing certain I'm going to
[1:45:00] leave those things which are behind
[1:45:02] behind
[1:45:04] I'm going to leave them
[1:45:06] they're over
[1:45:08] if they're placed under the blood
[1:45:09] they're thrown in Sea of God's
[1:45:11] forgiveness and I love this attitude he
[1:45:14] says Brethren I count myself to
[1:45:18] not myself to have apprehended but this
[1:45:21] one thing I do
[1:45:23] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:45:26] and reaching forth to those things which
[1:45:30] are before
[1:45:32] I hope you all have something before you
[1:45:35] that you're reaching for
[1:45:38] a sweeter spirit
[1:45:43] in my own personal self I want to mind
[1:45:47] that recognizes the Lord recognizes
[1:45:50] needs recognizes the move of the spirit
[1:45:53] I want to be more in tune more acute
[1:45:57] more in harmony
[1:46:00] uh with the body and with one another
[1:46:03] and with the word in the will of the
[1:46:06] Lord I believe there's something that
[1:46:08] lies before us I don't want to go by
[1:46:11] myself
[1:46:12] I want to go with you
[1:46:16] amen I want to apprehend together
[1:46:20] as a body and as individuals in Polk
[1:46:24] sums it up
[1:46:26] he says I leave and I
[1:46:28] and I reach for those things which are
[1:46:32] before I press toward
[1:46:35] the mark
[1:46:36] for the prize
[1:46:38] of the High Calling of God in Christ
[1:46:42] Jesus
[1:46:44] we have a high calling
[1:46:49] can you think of the higher calling than
[1:46:51] to be called the bride of Christ
[1:46:54] can you think of a higher calling to be
[1:46:58] the those that have been
[1:47:00] chosen to manifest the word of God in
[1:47:05] this hour can you think of a higher
[1:47:07] calling
[1:47:08] then to be the last sign
[1:47:12] that this Dying World wherever get the
[1:47:16] last voice that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:47:19] yesterday today and forever
[1:47:22] you don't I just came back from my
[1:47:25] mother in California and and I I I I see
[1:47:29] a Dying World
[1:47:30] I I see a a new a new Jesus that's put
[1:47:36] forth and a a a new approach to life and
[1:47:40] all those things but there's got to be
[1:47:42] somebody
[1:47:43] that stands up that says that he's the
[1:47:46] same yesterday today and forever and so
[1:47:50] let us let us realize
[1:47:53] that there's a higher calling in Christ
[1:47:55] Jesus for us all we haven't obtained it
[1:47:59] we haven't apprehended it but we're
[1:48:02] going to leave those things that are
[1:48:04] behind behind and we're going to reach
[1:48:06] for that Higher Calling we're going to
[1:48:09] press for that higher mark
[1:48:11] until we've come to the High Calling
[1:48:15] in the Lord Jesus each of you have been
[1:48:18] called
[1:48:19] each of you possess a calling and I pray
[1:48:24] for you that this next year
[1:48:26] that your calling would become more
[1:48:28] clear to you
[1:48:31] that your position in the body
[1:48:34] would become more real to you
[1:48:37] that your value
[1:48:40] as a member of the body
[1:48:43] because each member's fitted and joined
[1:48:45] together
[1:48:47] that you will realize that we can't make
[1:48:49] it without you
[1:48:52] that you're important
[1:48:55] that nobody can take your place
[1:48:59] and we need one another to run this race
[1:49:02] to fight this fight
[1:49:06] I'd hate to get to heaven and be there
[1:49:08] alone
[1:49:11] I want to have Fellowship
[1:49:13] I want to rejoice
[1:49:15] and so I I trust tonight I'm sure
[1:49:18] brother Billy will prepare
[1:49:20] for communion
[1:49:23] uh Forest whatever he has planned for
[1:49:26] this service but I just want us to in
[1:49:29] our hearts to realize
[1:49:31] we don't need to look back
[1:49:34] God's fixing to do something
[1:49:37] let's press for that calling
[1:49:40] that's the love of God to be shed abroad
[1:49:43] in our heart by the Holy Spirit let's
[1:49:45] grow more in the unity and love and I
[1:49:49] believe the Holy Spirit the power of God
[1:49:52] to make every promise
[1:49:55] come to pass will rest on your lives
[1:49:58] will give you joy and peace that we will
[1:50:01] reign together

[1:50:06] year of his coming even so come quickly
