[12:26] morning, God has been so good to me, so
[12:29] good beyond measure, beyond any words,
[12:32] beyond anything I can comprehend. I tell
[12:34] you, it's his goodness that brings us to
[12:37] him. When when we can come in an
[12:39] understanding of the price that is paid
[12:41] and everything that he does for us, both
[12:44] seen and unseen, that brings you into
[12:46] his goodness this morning. Amen. Brother
[12:49] David Jr., you if you could just come
[12:50] and open our service in prayer.
[12:52] Certainly happy to be gather in his
[12:54] presence. And I trust you here. You're
[12:56] happy to be in the house of God. And
[12:58] Amen.
[13:08] So thankful to be in his house this
[13:09] morning. I know many of you became aware
[13:13] we were on the trip and we heard of the
[13:14] floods back in Texas and there's a part
[13:18] of a news story I read and they there's
[13:21] a I guess a man who owns a restaurant
[13:23] down in South Texas
[13:26] and
[13:29] he was
[13:31] contemplating what it was like to be the
[13:33] families that are missing their girls.
[13:36] He says, "I I couldn't imagine what it
[13:38] feels like." He says, "But I don't need
[13:41] to. I just need to make sandwiches.
[13:43] If I can make sandwiches, then I could
[13:45] feed the responders. If they're out
[13:47] there looking, then maybe they could
[13:50] save a life. I think every single one of
[13:53] us has something we can do. It may not
[13:55] be making sandwiches, but we can go to
[13:57] prayer this morning.
[13:59] We can ask the Lord to move. We can do
[14:01] our part." And I just
[14:05] pray the Lord would comfort those
[14:06] families. But there's something God
[14:09] wants to do this morning and we just
[14:11] have to do our part. So let's go to him
[14:14] together in prayer. Heavenly Father,
[14:16] we're thankful to be gathered together
[14:18] in your house, Lord. Lord, when we come
[14:22] and we hear the praises of your people
[14:24] sung. And Lord, we remember the good
[14:27] things you've done for us, Lord. That
[14:29] you're the one who's kept us. You're the
[14:30] one who's preserved us. Lord, when our
[14:33] hearts were cast down and we were
[14:34] troubled, you comforted us, Lord. Lord,
[14:37] when we needed a healing touch, you
[14:39] healed us. And Lord, when we were
[14:41] dismayed, you gave a soundness of mind.
[14:44] And Lord, truly, if we could look back
[14:46] and see all the things you've done and
[14:49] yesterday, we can believe that today
[14:51] now, you're the I am God. You're the
[14:53] present help in the time of need. You
[14:55] still calm the storms. And Father, we
[14:58] ask now you'd come and have complete
[14:59] preeminence. Lord, you would do
[15:01] something special to move upon each
[15:03] heart and each mind to bring us in one
[15:05] accord, Lord. Because we know that as we
[15:08] come together as your people, Father, if
[15:10] we agree on any one thing, Lord, mighty
[15:13] things could be done. And so, we're
[15:14] agreeing, Father, that this service will
[15:16] be to your glory, Father, that people
[15:18] will not leave the same. Those who came
[15:20] in sick will leave well. Those who came
[15:22] in, Lord, needing a question upon their
[15:25] heart, needing an answer, Lord, will
[15:26] leave with that answer. Lord, that you
[15:28] would start to move into the miraculous,
[15:30] Father. That you're the God of the
[15:32] impossible, Lord. We didn't come just to
[15:34] have a church service and leave the same
[15:36] fulfilling some obligation, Lord. But
[15:39] we're putting ourselves before you that
[15:40] you would come and do only the things
[15:43] you can do, Father. Lord, so our
[15:45] expectation is is regardless of how
[15:47] impossible we thought something is, you
[15:49] can accomplish it, Lord. So, we're
[15:51] committing this service to you. from
[15:53] each song that is sung, the testimonies
[15:55] that are given. Father, we just ask you
[15:58] to come now, have complete preeminence,
[16:00] and have it the praises of your people,
[16:02] Lord, and just Lord, do only the things
[16:05] that you can do. For we've asked it in
[16:06] the mighty name of our Lord and Savior
[16:08] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[16:13] Amen. Amen. We want to welcome all our
[16:16] visitors this morning. Man, it's good to
[16:18] see Brother Joy and Sister Grace and the
[16:21] baby over there. And I know sister
[16:24] Verinique must be the happiest
[16:25] grandmother tonight and this morning.
[16:28] And just turn around and welcome someone
[16:30] this morning in the house of God. And
[16:32] all our visitors are certainly happy to
[16:34] have you with us. Amen.
[16:46] Let's open our Bibles for song reading
[16:48] this morning. Psalm 34. Amen. I just
[16:51] woke up this morning and as brother
[16:53] David Junior said this morning, you
[16:55] know, no matter what state you are in,
[16:57] you want to praise him and you want to
[16:59] understand that our praise shall
[17:01] continually be on our lips. Amen. I'll
[17:04] read the first congregation will read
[17:06] the second and we'll join together on
[17:08] the last. Amen.
[17:11] It said, I will bless the Lord all
[17:13] times. His praise shall continually be
[17:16] in my mouth.
[17:25] Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us
[17:28] exalt his name together.
[17:40] were not ashamed.
[17:48] The angel of the Lord encamp around
[17:50] about them that fear him and delivered
[17:53] them.
[17:59] Oh, fear the Lord, oh ye saints, for
[18:02] there is no want to them that fear him.
[18:13] Come ye children, hearken unto me. I
[18:16] will teach you the fear of the Lord.
[18:28] from speaking
[18:29] guile.
[18:35] The eyes of the Lord are upon the
[18:37] righteous and his ears are open unto
[18:40] their cry.
[18:48] The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth,
[18:51] and deliver them out of all their
[18:53] troubles.
[19:02] Many are the afflictions of the
[19:03] righteous, but the Lord delivered him
[19:06] out of them all.
[19:13] Evil shall slay the wicked, and they
[19:16] shall hate the righteous shall be
[19:19] desolate.
[19:20] The Lord remembered the soul of his
[19:22] righteous servant, and none of them that
[19:25] trust in him shall be desolate. Amen.
[19:28] God bless you. May have your seats.
[19:30] Amen. A flat.

[30:34] God bless you.
[30:37] Before we sing our special, I just
[30:39] wanted to share my testimony of how the
[30:42] Lord healed me at Indiana camp. I was
[30:45] dealing with a lot of pain in my left
[30:48] hip. And it um it started in April at
[30:52] Louisiana camp when me and Zoe we were
[30:54] kayaking and um we were sitting there
[30:58] for like a long time and then my left
[31:00] hip which was what hurt it cramped and
[31:03] it hurt really bad but I didn't think
[31:05] anything of it since I just thought it
[31:07] was just because of the kayaking. And
[31:09] then from then like till now this camp
[31:13] my I was completely normal. I had no
[31:16] pain absolutely nothing. I was
[31:18] completely healthy. And then at BYC, it
[31:23] was the during the evening service uh on
[31:26] Monday, June 30th, I really felt the
[31:30] Lord just speaking to me through that
[31:32] service. And the preacher was just
[31:34] speaking on things that was really on my
[31:36] heart. And I went and I knelt down at
[31:39] the altar. And I was just I just lost
[31:43] track of time in the presence of the
[31:45] Lord. And I really just felt the Lord
[31:48] just touch me. And um I didn't know how
[31:52] long I was there for. I I was just
[31:54] kneeling. And um then sister Julia, she
[31:58] she came and she prayed with me and she
[32:00] sat with me and she stayed till I was
[32:03] ready to get up. And because I was
[32:06] sitting for so long, uh it took me a
[32:08] minute to get up and because I had cut
[32:11] like circulation in my legs. But um and
[32:14] then it was fine. and I was able to walk
[32:16] and not it was just completely normal.
[32:19] And then um even though that service
[32:22] touched me and I went down at the altar,
[32:25] I still just felt a heaviness and a kind
[32:28] of restlessness in my heart and
[32:32] um I just thought I just didn't know
[32:35] why, but I just still I felt something
[32:37] just a big burden on my heart. And the
[32:40] next day I woke up. It was like Tuesday,
[32:44] July 1st, and I woke up with a little
[32:46] bit of pain in my left hip, but I just
[32:49] ignored it because I just thought it was
[32:51] because of kneeling the other night. And
[32:54] I just ignored it and I didn't really
[32:57] think anything of it. And then again
[32:59] during the evening service, I just it it
[33:02] spoke to me more than any of the
[33:05] services and I just felt that I needed
[33:10] to just pray. So I just I sat down in my
[33:14] seat and I just prayed and I just
[33:16] started to cry and cry and that I really
[33:20] I felt just a whole other presence and
[33:25] um then after in my seat I went to the
[33:28] altar again and again I just I just
[33:33] truly that night I felt like I truly
[33:36] gave my whole heart to the Lord and I
[33:39] just I stayed there I think way longer
[33:42] than the other night and I just was just
[33:44] lost in his presence and I just felt
[33:47] this like overwhelming peace just come
[33:50] into my heart and I didn't think about
[33:54] how I was sitting. I didn't think about
[33:56] how long I was sitting. I just was just
[33:59] lost in his presence. And
[34:02] then um I it was after that that
[34:07] um I when I was getting up I couldn't my
[34:12] hip that was when my hip really started
[34:14] to hurt and I couldn't even stand
[34:17] straight. I needed like Zoe and um Anita
[34:22] and a few other sisters. They had to
[34:24] pick me up from the floor and it just
[34:27] the pain got so bad and um one of the
[34:30] sisters had told me to go like try and
[34:33] like stretch my hip and like try and
[34:35] like pop it cuz I was sitting on it for
[34:37] a really long time. So I did that and
[34:40] then the pain I was like in laying down
[34:44] and I and then the pain just
[34:46] skyrocketed. It just got really bad. And
[34:49] then I started just I was panicking cuz
[34:53] I didn't know what was happening. I
[34:54] didn't know why. And I just got really I
[34:57] just panicked and I started
[34:58] hyperventilating and I was just gasping
[35:01] for breath. I couldn't breathe and I was
[35:03] just shaking. And then because of the um
[35:06] hyperventilation and because I was like
[35:09] not taking in enough air, my body just
[35:13] started tingling and I couldn't move. I
[35:16] couldn't move my hands, my legs, my
[35:19] face. My Zoe had FaceTimed my parents
[35:21] and my dad had told me to smile and I
[35:23] couldn't move my face and my body I
[35:26] couldn't I just couldn't move. And
[35:28] that's when I
[35:31] started like I got even more panicked.
[35:34] So that's when I just they called 911
[35:37] and they had to call an ambulance and
[35:40] cuz I was like
[35:43] it just got really bad and I just
[35:46] couldn't breathe and my body was just
[35:47] stuck and I panicked even more because
[35:50] of
[35:52] um
[35:54] not being able to move and just the
[35:55] pain. And so then they called the ER and
[35:58] the ambulance came and then they took me
[35:59] out on a stretcher and um then at the ER
[36:03] they took an X-ray and they did a few
[36:05] like blood tests and an IV and um it the
[36:09] X-ray showed that everything was normal
[36:13] and I was it just showed that I was like
[36:14] dehydrated and um low on potassium but
[36:18] nothing like too serious. Nothing was
[36:20] like damaged or broken or anything. And
[36:24] um
[36:26] uh yeah, just after the hospital, after
[36:29] we got back, the it just my hip I could
[36:32] not walk. I could not do anything. I
[36:35] could not sit up by myself. I needed
[36:37] someone to like pull me up. I couldn't
[36:39] stand. I couldn't lay down. I just need
[36:43] I just couldn't do anything. It just
[36:44] hurt so bad. And I'm so blessed to have
[36:47] had like Zoe and Sister Julia and so
[36:50] many people help me and they just really
[36:54] stayed by my side and just showed me so
[36:57] much love and took such good care of me
[36:59] and
[37:02] um so Thursday so that I went to the
[37:05] hospital Tuesday and then Wednesday and
[37:08] Thursday were just really bad pain.
[37:10] Thursday morning, I tried going to the
[37:12] morning service, but I just had to leave
[37:16] um early because
[37:18] uh my hip I couldn't sit for that long.
[37:20] it would just like like have like sharp
[37:22] pains and um so uh we went back to the
[37:26] dorm and did like we just rested and I
[37:29] thought we were thinking me, sister
[37:32] Julia and Zoe were thinking to just stay
[37:35] and live uh stream the evening service
[37:39] and then thankfully brother David had
[37:41] come and he prayed for me and he
[37:42] insisted that even though it hurts we
[37:46] could take whatever we needed but just
[37:48] to be there in the service and to listen
[37:50] to it. And thankfully he did and I was
[37:53] able to like lay in the back and still
[37:55] be able to be there. And then brother
[37:57] David and other brothers, they had came
[37:59] and they prayed for me. They laid their
[38:01] hands and prayed for me. And then
[38:04] when we were walking out of the service,
[38:07] I real I couldn't before the service I
[38:12] couldn't extend my leg. I kept it like I
[38:14] was limping and I just couldn't put any
[38:17] pressure. But then after the service
[38:19] when we were walking out um I realized I
[38:21] could extend my leg and I slowly let go
[38:26] of sister Julie and Zoe who were like um
[38:29] who I was leaning on to help walk and I
[38:32] could stand and I could walk and without
[38:36] any support and the Lord truly just
[38:39] healed me in that moment. Listen to
[38:41] their prayers.
[38:51] And then we once I could walk we could
[38:55] we went around and we went testifying
[38:58] and we were we went around into like the
[39:01] gyms and then our counselor was like
[39:03] everyone look new walking and cuz like
[39:06] everyone saw like me just limping and I
[39:08] had to ride in like go-karts cuz I
[39:09] couldn't move but we just ran around
[39:11] praising and pe like everyone started
[39:13] crying And it was just truly so
[39:16] beautiful how the Lord had just
[39:19] delivered me in that moment. And after
[39:23] that night I went to the hospital. The
[39:25] whole camp had prayed for me. Like
[39:29] everyone in the girls dorms, the boys
[39:31] dorms, the staff, people like campers
[39:34] who didn't even know me told their
[39:37] churches and their families to pray for
[39:39] me. And I truly just felt so loved and
[39:44] so blessed to be surrounded by brothers
[39:47] and sisters who they didn't even know
[39:49] me. Entire churches didn't even know me,
[39:52] but they still prayed for me. And I
[39:55] truly believe that the Lord heard all of
[39:57] our prayers. And I just truly can't
[40:01] thank the Lord enough for his goodness
[40:03] and for his grace. And I'm very blessed
[40:06] to be able to stand here without any
[40:09] pain, completely normal, and testify
[40:11] what the Lord has done.
[40:21] Um, this song has truly been a blessing
[40:24] to us and we hope it's a blessing to
[40:25] you, too.

[48:04] was representative of a an eternal love,
[48:08] Lord. And Father, that's what we're

[55:31] and your love extended to us.
[55:35] [Music]
[55:38] But father today as parents and
[55:42] grandparents
[55:44] our heart turns to
[55:48] those of our Christian faith who had
[55:52] sent their daughters to a a Christian
[55:55] camp
[55:57] father because they wanted them to have
[55:59] Christian principles and
[56:03] Lord and a tragedy came their way him.
[56:08] They lost so many, Father.
[56:12] And Lord, we
[56:17] just join with believers all over the
[56:21] world who are asking for your grace and
[56:24] kindness to comfort hearts.
[56:28] Father, we know that those children were
[56:30] young and that Father, you taken them
[56:33] home
[56:34] and that one day they'll be youed.
[56:37] Father, I pray that every parent finds
[56:39] the place in their life that
[56:42] they can
[56:45] know that they have a hope if they turn
[56:47] their lives to you that they can meet
[56:50] again,
[56:52] Father. And as we lose loved ones along
[56:55] life's journey,
[56:57] Father, we have a hope
[57:00] that one day,
[57:03] Father, we'll come face to face with you
[57:06] and all that we love. We ask you to
[57:09] bless our service this morning. Father,
[57:12] may it help us. May it
[57:16] accomplish, Father, something in our
[57:18] lives that we can begin to see the
[57:22] importance
[57:23] of the place that we play in the eternal
[57:27] work of your hand. We ask you to bless
[57:30] each heart. Each person in here this
[57:32] morning is important.
[57:35] Each person in here is a part of your
[57:37] great plan. Father, we are fitted and
[57:40] joined together and we can't make it
[57:43] without one another. Father, bind us in
[57:46] your love this morning. I ask it in
[57:48] Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[57:51] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[57:55] morning. If you have your Bibles, uh
[57:57] we'll read our scripture first and then
[58:00] we will um
[58:03] we will uh
[58:05] go forward from there.
[58:08] And if we turn to the book of
[58:10] Revelations, the 20th chapter
[58:14] and the first verse,
[58:17] book of Revelations.
[58:27] And let me see if I have that right.
[58:35] If Do I have that right? Let me see. It
[58:37] has to It says 21.
[58:41] Okay. Re revelations 20 and1. It says,
[58:45] "And I saw an angel come down from
[58:48] heaven having the key of the bottomless
[58:52] pit and of a great chain in his hand."
[58:58] And then also I'd like to just turn over
[59:00] to Luke the 11th chapter and the 57th
[59:05] verse.
[59:07] The Gospel of Luke,
[59:18] the 52nd verse,
[59:24] it says, and uh
[59:28] where it says lawyers here, this doesn't
[59:30] necessarily the same type of lawyer that
[59:34] we have. My son's a lawyer, so I don't
[59:37] apply this scripture to him.
[59:40] It says, "Woe to you lawyers, for ye
[59:44] have taken away the key of knowledge. Ye
[59:48] enter not in yourselves, and them that
[59:53] were entering in, ye hindered." Our
[59:58] father, we ask you to bless your word to
[1:00:00] us in your precious name we pray. Amen.
[1:00:03] God bless. You may be seated this
[1:00:04] morning.
[1:00:09] It's always wonderful to be in the house
[1:00:11] of the Lord and and our our whole heart
[1:00:16] and theme that we've been just
[1:00:21] trying to express out as we are uh
[1:00:26] living a Christian life. And I think it
[1:00:29] should be a question that we all have.
[1:00:31] where do we go from here?
[1:00:34] You know, what what lays in store for
[1:00:37] me? And uh uh so and what what's the way
[1:00:43] to that path? And my heart was moved by
[1:00:47] this message called the key to the door.
[1:00:49] And we want to share some things from
[1:00:52] that this morning. And I thought of the
[1:00:55] other day I thought of a key and I I
[1:00:58] believe somebody lost their keys and we
[1:01:00] prayed that they found their key and and
[1:01:04] uh so if I had a title this morning I
[1:01:06] would say have I lost my key and has
[1:01:09] anybody ever lost your keys? Does
[1:01:12] anybody have trouble with keys like I
[1:01:15] have trouble with keys? like it's just
[1:01:18] it just seems like uh um a key a key has
[1:01:23] a a a lot of different meanings and to
[1:01:27] today we just want to fellowship around
[1:01:29] and and bring to our understanding that
[1:01:32] there's a key of faith and and have we
[1:01:36] lost the key to faith
[1:01:40] and and and so as we uh study this
[1:01:44] through I hope that in the simplicity
[1:01:49] that it's hidden
[1:01:51] that it will just open up to us. And I'd
[1:01:55] like to play this morning uh because uh
[1:02:00] uh a little portion 15 minutes of the
[1:02:04] back of this tape and it's a familiar
[1:02:07] story for many of you who have been in
[1:02:09] the message for a while. But uh faith
[1:02:14] always has a challenge.
[1:02:17] And uh and I want you to see this great
[1:02:20] uh understanding
[1:02:23] of how that it it takes just
[1:02:26] perseverance
[1:02:28] and it takes the ability to stay with it
[1:02:31] and hold on and to believe in and and
[1:02:36] and trust in what God's given you. So, I
[1:02:41] think you'll enjoy this little story.
[1:02:43] Uh, you you may know it well if you've
[1:02:46] never heard it before. I trust that it's
[1:02:48] a blessing to you, but it's it's it
[1:02:51] starts on paragraph 70 in the message,
[1:02:55] the key to the door. It's just about 14
[1:02:58] minutes long. So, just listen and and
[1:03:01] then we'll pick up this message from the
[1:03:04] beginning, you know. And so um remember
[1:03:08] one thing, if God be for us, who can be
[1:03:11] against us? Amen. If God be for us, who
[1:03:15] can be against us? Just listen to this
[1:03:18] testimony uh as we uh listen to this for
[1:03:21] just a few minutes. God bless you.
[1:03:26] One time here a few years ago, there's a
[1:03:29] missionary brethren and he felt he had a
[1:03:33] call to Africa. He was a young fella, a
[1:03:37] wife and two children, very pretty young
[1:03:40] girls, about seven, eight years old a
[1:03:42] piece. And this young fella couldn't get
[1:03:45] away from it. He was a a minister. He
[1:03:48] had a nice church and the country, but
[1:03:51] he just couldn't get away from that
[1:03:53] call. he must go to Africa and he prayed
[1:03:57] day and night he didn't want to go and
[1:04:00] God kept speaking to him you must go and
[1:04:04] finally come to a place till he a
[1:04:06] showdown where he he must go so he went
[1:04:09] to the mission board of his church and
[1:04:11] he said God has called me to mission
[1:04:15] fields way back in the jungles of of
[1:04:20] Rhodesia
[1:04:22] and in this jungle
[1:04:24] It's infested with malaria and with uh
[1:04:27] fever and with that hot sun and plagery
[1:04:30] and leprosy and all kinds of diseases
[1:04:34] back in this jungle the where he was
[1:04:37] going to make take the rest of his life
[1:04:39] sold his home and all he had. So the
[1:04:42] mission board wanted to test him and
[1:04:46] they said are you sure now he said I am
[1:04:50] positive.
[1:04:51] They said to him, "Sir, have you thought
[1:04:55] it on this matter
[1:04:58] that you've got two pretty little girls
[1:05:02] and you got a a lovely young wife
[1:05:05] and if you're just Why don't you just go
[1:05:08] over and see how it is and then come
[1:05:10] back?" He said, "No, the Lord told me."
[1:05:16] Oh, it's so real. He said, "The Lord
[1:05:20] called me
[1:05:22] and I I don't want to leave my home. I
[1:05:25] don't want to leave my church and my
[1:05:27] people, but the Lord called me back
[1:05:32] there in that jungle."
[1:05:35] And he said, "Sir, did you know your
[1:05:38] little girls could take yala fever or
[1:05:41] black water fever and die overnight?"
[1:05:44] And he referred to different people that
[1:05:47] had lost their children, the little
[1:05:48] fellas to take them back in their own
[1:05:50] diseases that they had no inoculation
[1:05:52] part and said, "Think of leprosy of your
[1:05:56] pretty wife and your two little girls
[1:05:59] with leprosy
[1:06:00] and that hot sun and things you got to
[1:06:03] put up with said, "Aren't you afraid
[1:06:06] and the danger of taking your children
[1:06:09] and wife in such a place?" And the
[1:06:12] missionaries stood there, the young
[1:06:14] fellow, and the tears began to run down
[1:06:16] his cheeks. He turned around and said,
[1:06:18] "My brethren,
[1:06:20] my vision of God's call."
[1:06:23] He said, "If God has called me to
[1:06:26] Africa, my children and families more
[1:06:29] safer in Africa than any place in the
[1:06:31] world."
[1:06:34] Hallelujah.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] What was it? He had the key to his call.
[1:06:39] Amen.
[1:06:40] He had faith in what he was talking
[1:06:42] about.
[1:06:42] Amen.
[1:06:44] Oh, I thought what a gallant remark.
[1:06:47] Hallelujah. When
[1:06:48] I first heard that, my heart bounced.
[1:06:50] See, if God has called me to Africa, my
[1:06:55] children in the leprosy and flaggery and
[1:06:58] everything else are safer there than any
[1:07:00] other place on the face of the earth.
[1:07:04] He had the key. That's what it takes.
[1:07:07] When you got the key, there's no fear.
[1:07:10] There's no doubt. There's no question.
[1:07:12] You don't have to ask anybody else about
[1:07:14] it.
[1:07:15] You know exactly. You've got it in your
[1:07:18] hands.
[1:07:19] You know what to do.
[1:07:21] Amen.
[1:07:23] Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] You know what the score is. You know the
[1:07:26] door is going to unlock.
[1:07:29] You check the levers and you know it's
[1:07:31] strictly the right thing.
[1:07:33] The door is going to fly open. You throw
[1:07:35] the key in it. Oh, if the church only
[1:07:39] possessed the keys. Amen. If the church
[1:07:43] only possessed that key of faith,
[1:07:46] we could unlock any door, any sickness,
[1:07:49] any plague, any case that there is. It
[1:07:53] could be unlocked to us. If we could
[1:07:55] only possess this key, this man had the
[1:07:58] key to his calling.
[1:08:01] If you'll pardon the personal uh
[1:08:04] testimony, I remember about 15 17 years
[1:08:10] ago now about when the Lord said to me
[1:08:13] down there on the river when he came
[1:08:16] down in that pillar of fire whose
[1:08:18] picture you see and he spoke to me and
[1:08:21] he said, "You're to take this message
[1:08:24] around the world." Amen.
[1:08:26] I remember at Greens Mill when he spoke
[1:08:29] to me and I went and told the pastor and
[1:08:32] he told me, he said, "Billy, what did
[1:08:35] you eat that night? You had a
[1:08:37] nightmare."
[1:08:40] He said, "Go on back to your job. You're
[1:08:42] working at the public service company.
[1:08:43] Got a good job. Go on back and take care
[1:08:46] of your your business, son." Said, "You
[1:08:48] had a nightmare. You eat something."
[1:08:51] That didn't faze me one bit. Amen.
[1:08:55] When I started out for the healing
[1:08:57] services, many of you here remember my
[1:09:00] message that morning as David went to
[1:09:02] meet Goliath I preached on and they told
[1:09:05] me he said in the day of modern science
[1:09:08] when we have got all kinds of medical
[1:09:10] research when we've got the best doctors
[1:09:13] when the church has long forgot divine
[1:09:15] healing and stuff from many many years
[1:09:17] ago. How are you going before a great
[1:09:20] giant like that? How are you going to
[1:09:23] walk out in the face of the Methodist,
[1:09:25] Baptist, Presbyterian, and so forth and
[1:09:26] even the Pentecostals who has forgotten
[1:09:29] a long time ago and went into their
[1:09:31] creeks? How are you going to face with
[1:09:33] no denomination or nothing else to back
[1:09:35] you up?
[1:09:36] What are you going to do, Bill? Somehow
[1:09:39] another
[1:09:41] phase me one bit
[1:09:43] for I help in my hand a king.
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:49] I said, they said, "Nobody will believe
[1:09:51] you. You won't be able to do it. Nobody
[1:09:54] will believe you." I said, "I don't
[1:09:56] care."
[1:09:58] There's one thing sure. God called me
[1:10:01] and I must go
[1:10:04] because God called me.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] I held the key.
[1:10:09] He had called me. He had showed me. He
[1:10:11] had told me. And I saw his presence when
[1:10:13] he commissioned me. And the key was
[1:10:16] there. Amen.
[1:10:17] The pastor said with his seventh grade
[1:10:19] education and you're going to preach and
[1:10:22] pray before kings and monarchs. I said
[1:10:25] that's according to his word.
[1:10:28] Amen.
[1:10:31] about this time last year
[1:10:34] or a week or two before when I'd come to
[1:10:36] the church here and told you that the
[1:10:39] Lord God had given me a vision of go
[1:10:42] taking a hunting trip and a certain
[1:10:45] animal I was going to find that is going
[1:10:48] to have 42in horns on it and on the road
[1:10:51] back from getting this animal where it
[1:10:52] would be laying in the position it would
[1:10:54] be in on the road back I was going to
[1:10:56] kill a silver tip grizzly bear there
[1:11:00] and I went to this certain section
[1:11:04] and I spoke to the man and he said, "I
[1:11:08] don't know of any animal that looks like
[1:11:10] that." And as far as a grizzly bear,
[1:11:12] I've never seen one.
[1:11:14] I said, "But somewhere it's got to be
[1:11:17] here."
[1:11:21] So he said, "We're not even going into
[1:11:23] bare country.
[1:11:25] We're going up for sheep way up above
[1:11:28] Timberline.
[1:11:30] Well, I went with him in the second day
[1:11:32] out in the very spot at exactly where
[1:11:36] the Lord said, "There laid the animal."
[1:11:42] So, when I went and got the animal and
[1:11:44] while we were uh taking the skin and the
[1:11:48] horns and so forth off, he said, "I want
[1:11:51] to ask you something.
[1:11:54] You told me three days ago when we left
[1:11:57] the the camp that after you had shot
[1:12:01] this certain beast that on the road back
[1:12:05] you was going to kill a silver tip
[1:12:07] grizzly bear. I said that's thus saith
[1:12:11] the Lord.
[1:12:12] Hallelujah.
[1:12:14] Said I'm not doubting.
[1:12:16] He said, "Because my brother was an
[1:12:18] epileptic and you never seen him in your
[1:12:20] life when he was up here one time and
[1:12:22] you told me that boy was going to be
[1:12:23] healed when I done a certain thing and
[1:12:25] he was."
[1:12:27] He said, "Now, but Brother Brandham, I
[1:12:29] want to ask you." He said, "I can see
[1:12:34] all the way down that mountain to where
[1:12:37] the timber line is. Them horses are
[1:12:39] standing
[1:12:41] and there's nothing there.
[1:12:45] There isn't a speck of grass. There
[1:12:48] isn't a rock. There isn't nothing.
[1:12:52] Caribou moss which is about two inches
[1:12:54] high on above timber lines for a mile or
[1:12:58] more above the timber line. Said, "Where
[1:13:01] is the bear going to be?"
[1:13:05] I said, "God is Jehovah Gyra."
[1:13:10] If he's told me there will be a bear
[1:13:12] there, there'll be one there.
[1:13:15] down the mountain about every time we
[1:13:17] get a half a mile or so closer. He said,
[1:13:19] "Brother Brandon, about time for that
[1:13:21] bear to appear."
[1:13:24] I said, "Don't worry, he'll be here."
[1:13:26] And when we were almost within about 500
[1:13:29] yards of where the horses was, we had to
[1:13:31] rest again with the heavy horns and
[1:13:33] things on our back. And he looked around
[1:13:35] again, and I seen his face as he looked
[1:13:38] at me as if down in his heart he was
[1:13:42] wondering. See, he had hope it would be
[1:13:45] there, but he didn't have the key.
[1:13:48] But somehow,
[1:13:51] by the grace of God, he's never failed
[1:13:55] me.
[1:13:56] When he told me there' be a silver tip
[1:13:59] there, I had the key.
[1:14:02] I didn't doubt it one bit.
[1:14:05] Not a bit. I turned to him and I said,
[1:14:08] "But
[1:14:11] it'll be there. And just as I turned,
[1:14:14] there was a bear
[1:14:18] standing right above us about a half a
[1:14:20] mile. He threw the glasses on. He said,
[1:14:22] "Billy, so help me." It's a big silver
[1:14:25] tip.
[1:14:26] See the key,
[1:14:29] a vision, the word of the Lord.
[1:14:32] Amen.
[1:14:33] There's nothing can change it or stop
[1:14:35] it.
[1:14:37] What the church needs tonight is not an
[1:14:39] education. What the church needs tonight
[1:14:41] is not a denomination. What the church
[1:14:44] needs tonight is not a creed. What the
[1:14:46] church needs tonight is a key to the
[1:14:48] scriptures, the door which Christ is the
[1:14:52] door and he is the word.
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:56] Faith in the word of the living God
[1:14:59] unlocks every door.
[1:15:01] Yes. Amen.
[1:15:02] God give us the key.
[1:15:04] Give us a key.
[1:15:08] Hebrews the 12th chapter says, "Seeing
[1:15:10] that we're compassed about such a great
[1:15:13] cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[1:15:16] every weight and the unbelief that does
[1:15:20] so easily beset us." It says sin, which
[1:15:22] sin is unbelief.
[1:15:26] Only one sin, that's unbelief.
[1:15:29] And sin means to miss some mark. like
[1:15:33] you're shooting. You missed some art.
[1:15:36] Better adjust your gun. See, because
[1:15:39] there's something wrong. You missed some
[1:15:41] art. See, come back and try over.
[1:15:45] Sin means to turn around. You've missed
[1:15:48] the mark.
[1:15:49] Yeah.
[1:15:50] When you want to be a Christian and you
[1:15:52] go join the church, you miss the mark.
[1:15:56] When you want to be a Christian and
[1:15:58] you've been sprinkled in the name of the
[1:16:00] Father, Son, Holy Ghost, you miss the
[1:16:02] mark. But come back.
[1:16:05] You'll not be on the target. You'll
[1:16:07] scatter as sure as the world. Only one
[1:16:10] thing can hold you in a perfect line.
[1:16:12] That's the scripture.
[1:16:14] The Bible, the word. For both heavens
[1:16:17] and earth will pass away. But God's word
[1:16:19] will never pass away.
[1:16:21] So hold the key. Faith in the word.
[1:16:27] and every bit of faith that you believe
[1:16:29] and don't doubt one spec you're going to
[1:16:31] unlock every door that stands between
[1:16:33] you and the blessing that God has for
[1:16:35] you.
[1:16:36] May God help us to have the keys is my
[1:16:38] prayer.
[1:16:39] Let us bow our heads now for a word of
[1:16:41] prayer.
[1:16:50] He makes this statement. What the church
[1:16:52] needs tonight is the key to the
[1:16:55] scriptures, the door, which Christ is
[1:16:59] the door. He is the word. Faith in the
[1:17:02] word of the living God unlocks every
[1:17:05] door. And so uh and he makes this a
[1:17:11] great uh prayer and so that we realize
[1:17:17] that there's got to be a key.
[1:17:20] You understand that, right? And and so
[1:17:24] when you begin to think about a key and
[1:17:27] and you we have a keys to a lot of
[1:17:29] different things in our our life, you
[1:17:31] know, we have keys to our cars, keys to
[1:17:33] our house, keys to a lot of different
[1:17:36] things. And and so we understand that if
[1:17:40] there's a key to those things, he says
[1:17:42] there's also a key to faith.
[1:17:45] There's there's something that unlocks
[1:17:47] it for you. And that's what we want to
[1:17:50] make sure that we haven't lost that key.
[1:17:54] And he said, if you're not hitting the
[1:17:56] mark, you understand if you're missing
[1:17:58] the mark, then you go back and you stop
[1:18:01] and you readjust and you you look at the
[1:18:04] situation again and you ask yourself, do
[1:18:07] have I lost my key? And there's if if
[1:18:11] I'm if I'm stuck and and and uh you you
[1:18:16] you begin to wonder, you know, do I have
[1:18:19] the the the key? What's the key to this?
[1:18:22] What's the key to the solution? What's
[1:18:24] the answer? And so we we understand that
[1:18:27] a a a key has a purpose. And I think if
[1:18:32] if we begin to understand that that if
[1:18:35] there is a key, then that key has to
[1:18:39] have a purpose. It's got it's got a
[1:18:42] reason that it's a key. And it's that
[1:18:45] that key is designed to unlock something
[1:18:49] to open it up. So the the key has a
[1:18:53] value to it and and it it's got a
[1:18:56] purpose. It's got a reason uh of of for
[1:19:00] the key. the reason that this key
[1:19:02] exists.
[1:19:04] So if you see a key somewhere, you can
[1:19:07] honestly look and say, "Oh, that key
[1:19:09] exists
[1:19:11] because there's a purpose for that key
[1:19:14] to unlock something." You know, you just
[1:19:17] don't make a key. A key is designed to
[1:19:20] fit. It's designed to fit into
[1:19:22] something. It's designed to fit and
[1:19:25] unlock something. And and if we're
[1:19:28] talking about the key of faith, it's
[1:19:30] designed to fit into something. It's got
[1:19:33] to have something that it fits to to
[1:19:36] unlock. You know, it's not like me and
[1:19:38] Davey the other day, we're up at the
[1:19:40] lake and we we got unhook the boat. So,
[1:19:43] we take the key and we stick the key and
[1:19:45] the key don't work. So, we don't just
[1:19:49] find the right key. We just unhook the
[1:19:52] whole bumper
[1:19:54] and off we go, you know, and and so you
[1:19:59] if you if there's a key, that key has
[1:20:02] been created
[1:20:04] or made if you want to use that word uh
[1:20:08] to have a purpose to unlock something.
[1:20:12] And you know, so a key has got a a
[1:20:14] purpose. And you know, there's a key to
[1:20:16] our life,
[1:20:19] you know, and and and and uh and you
[1:20:23] know, people don't even search for the
[1:20:26] key to their life, you know, they don't
[1:20:28] ask themselves, you know, life, uh uh
[1:20:31] what are we called for? You know, what's
[1:20:34] my calling? You know, I I'm I'm here.
[1:20:37] What am I here for? you know, I'm just
[1:20:39] going to struggle and I'm just going to
[1:20:41] go to work and pay my taxes and and die
[1:20:45] and then they're going to crate me off
[1:20:47] uh and stick me in a hole in the ground
[1:20:49] and and uh and and that's all the more
[1:20:53] uh uh you think of your life and the
[1:20:58] person that gave you that your life the
[1:21:01] God gave you your life because there's
[1:21:03] somebody in your life he wants to
[1:21:05] unlock.
[1:21:07] There's a key to unlock your life.
[1:21:10] There's a key for your existence, a key
[1:21:12] for your your purpose, you know, uh you
[1:21:16] know, a key for for uh what you're
[1:21:19] called for. I like that story of that
[1:21:22] man. He felt a calling in his life. he
[1:21:24] felt a reason for living, you know, and
[1:21:28] I'm not sure if that was Livingston
[1:21:30] maybe that made that great remark, but
[1:21:33] he, you know, he went down into and I
[1:21:36] know all their people from Zimbabwe said
[1:21:38] Zimbabwe, you know, Rhdesia, Zimbabwe,
[1:21:41] but uh so he went down in that river
[1:21:44] down there Nag uh at Vic Falls and all
[1:21:48] up through that country and they're
[1:21:50] preaching the gospel.
[1:21:52] But you see, he he he knew his calling
[1:21:56] was from God. And what the key to that
[1:21:59] calling was is he he finally understood
[1:22:02] what his existence was, what his reason
[1:22:05] for being was. And when he when he got
[1:22:08] that reason for being what that he was
[1:22:11] that he was uh his purpose in life and
[1:22:14] his calling in life and the reason that
[1:22:17] that he was here on earth that that he
[1:22:20] had a commission in his heart and the
[1:22:23] reason he the minute he found that
[1:22:26] he had a key to his whole life and
[1:22:29] that's why he could stand before him and
[1:22:31] said wait a minute it doesn't matter if
[1:22:33] this is what I'm called for I'm safer in
[1:22:36] my calling than I were in any other
[1:22:38] place in life. And I think that
[1:22:41] Christians have got to the place where
[1:22:43] they fear that being a Christian isn't
[1:22:47] going to be able to take them all the
[1:22:49] way through.
[1:22:53] That there has to be some compromise.
[1:22:58] You know, it's not good enough to
[1:23:00] substain us.
[1:23:03] We can't hold on to our principles.
[1:23:06] We can't hold on to our way of life.
[1:23:10] We can't hold on to the very key to our
[1:23:13] existence. We feel, oh, if we don't look
[1:23:15] like everybody else and we don't act
[1:23:17] like everybody else when we don't joke
[1:23:20] with the boys, you know, we'll lose our
[1:23:22] job. So what? God will give me another
[1:23:24] one.
[1:23:27] He said
[1:23:29] he said
[1:23:33] that the righteous shall not beg bread.
[1:23:39] But we lose those keys
[1:23:43] and and you know that that you know
[1:23:46] there there's something that should
[1:23:47] unlock to us what we should be doing.
[1:23:53] If if we don't if we don't know there's
[1:23:56] a key
[1:23:58] then we don't and we don't realize that
[1:24:01] you do it if you just lose the key.
[1:24:04] Sometimes people just abandon things
[1:24:06] because they don't have the key.
[1:24:10] They'll throw locks away. They'll throw
[1:24:12] things away because they don't have the
[1:24:13] key. And I wonder sometimes if we if we
[1:24:16] don't careful that we throw our life
[1:24:19] away.
[1:24:21] We let time How many knows time's moving
[1:24:24] fast? It just moves. You know what I
[1:24:28] mean? before you know it, you know,
[1:24:29] you're you're you know, you're looking
[1:24:31] there and you're thinking, "Wow, you
[1:24:34] know, how many how much more time do I
[1:24:37] have?"
[1:24:39] You know, to me now that time's more
[1:24:42] important than money.
[1:24:46] I got to spend all my money before I
[1:24:48] have to give it to my kids. And I don't
[1:24:50] got very much time to do that.
[1:24:57] I want to say that light-heartedly be
[1:24:59] because I think that that a lot of young
[1:25:02] people, a lot of us, we're young church.
[1:25:07] I don't think there's 10% of us that are
[1:25:09] over 50.
[1:25:12] So, we ought to, you know, we ought to
[1:25:14] consider, does my life have a reason?
[1:25:16] Does my life have a purpose? what can
[1:25:18] unlock my life?
[1:25:22] And so you begin to find it, you know,
[1:25:24] so you know, something's got to unlock
[1:25:27] our lives to us,
[1:25:32] you know. I I I love it when when
[1:25:34] somebody
[1:25:36] uh realizes maybe a mother or a
[1:25:38] housewife, they they just finally look
[1:25:40] me in the eye say, "You know, I I I just
[1:25:43] realized that I I was called to be a
[1:25:46] mother and a housewife.
[1:25:49] You know, they're not interested in a
[1:25:50] career anymore. I'm not against people
[1:25:52] that have careers. That's not what I'm
[1:25:54] saying. I'm talking about the peace that
[1:25:57] comes when you understand I I've got
[1:26:01] there's something in me that's calling
[1:26:04] me to this. And don't let that slip
[1:26:07] away. Get find out what unlocks your
[1:26:10] life to you. You know, people just go
[1:26:12] from place to place
[1:26:16] and and they think that they can just
[1:26:18] pack their belief with them. You know
[1:26:20] what I mean? like it it doesn't have any
[1:26:23] purpose or any rhyme or reason.
[1:26:27] You know, I believe I I just believe my
[1:26:31] doctrine. I have my belief. You know,
[1:26:32] it's like a thing of Kleenex. You know,
[1:26:34] I believe this and and I believe the
[1:26:37] message. So, off I go. You know, I can
[1:26:39] do whatever I want as long as I believe.
[1:26:43] I can go. I I you know, it's like it's
[1:26:45] like a suitcase.
[1:26:47] You just pack it. You know what I mean?
[1:26:49] So, you know, it's like uh uh some
[1:26:52] churches, you know, you used to have to
[1:26:53] go to the church. Well, you'd show up
[1:26:55] and they'd announce it at the over the
[1:26:58] pulpit, you know, uh brother George and
[1:27:01] and and uh brother Peggy Smith come to
[1:27:05] us today by le uh by way of letter.
[1:27:10] And so they get the letter from their
[1:27:12] church a good Baptist letter and then
[1:27:14] they bring that to the church and the
[1:27:16] church accepts their letter and
[1:27:18] everybody sex comes in. They come in by
[1:27:21] way of letter. They just pack it. You
[1:27:23] know sometimes we just pack this message
[1:27:25] around like we can go anywhere do
[1:27:27] anything we want. Uh just do whatever we
[1:27:30] feel that we we can do and and we just
[1:27:33] do it because uh uh we have we we we we
[1:27:37] have a belief.
[1:27:40] You know, a lot of people come to church
[1:27:42] on Sunday. They they come to church to
[1:27:44] fulfill
[1:27:46] their obligation to the message. They're
[1:27:49] not a part of this church. Uh they're
[1:27:51] really not a part of the ministry.
[1:27:52] They're here because they packed their
[1:27:55] belief in the message and and the says
[1:27:58] they got to go. So, they'll show up
[1:28:00] here, you know, and and that's fine. I'm
[1:28:02] I'm happy for you.
[1:28:04] Glad to have you. I love your
[1:28:07] fellowship. I hope you're a Christian
[1:28:09] and I hope you pray and and pay your
[1:28:11] way. That that that's what a Christian
[1:28:14] does. You You know what I mean? But
[1:28:16] there's something that there's a there's
[1:28:18] a they have no key.
[1:28:24] They they can't even unlock the the
[1:28:26] message in their life. It just becomes a
[1:28:29] belief. Well, I I I believe the message,
[1:28:31] but I believe there's things in this
[1:28:34] message that need to be unlocked. Just
[1:28:36] like there was this Bible that needed to
[1:28:39] be unlocked and God had to have a mighty
[1:28:41] angel come down and put his foot on the
[1:28:43] sea and take the book
[1:28:46] and open it up
[1:28:49] so that we could find out that we were
[1:28:51] we are not just the same church that was
[1:28:55] in every other age.
[1:28:57] We're not even in the church ages. We're
[1:29:00] a member of another age, a bride age.
[1:29:03] You know, we've got something to birth,
[1:29:05] something to bring forth,
[1:29:09] but but these things don't are are
[1:29:13] haven't even entered into the hearts and
[1:29:16] minds of men
[1:29:19] the things that God's prepared for them
[1:29:22] that love them. And so, what I'm saying
[1:29:25] is is we we don't have we lost the key
[1:29:34] and and and we need to find the key.
[1:29:40] We need to find a key to our life,
[1:29:44] key to our calling, a key to our
[1:29:47] existence.
[1:29:49] I mean, if you think that you're you're
[1:29:51] the purpose of your life is is just to
[1:29:54] get an education and get a job.
[1:30:01] I'd rather be a bum.
[1:30:05] Why go through all that stress?
[1:30:11] You know, if there's not more to you
[1:30:15] than that, I believe there's more to
[1:30:18] each of us
[1:30:21] than we really can fathom. I think
[1:30:24] there's there there's more character in
[1:30:26] us. I believe there's more power in us.
[1:30:30] I believe there's more vision in us. I
[1:30:33] believe there's more reality in us.
[1:30:35] There's more compassion in us, more
[1:30:38] feeling in us, more joy, more peace, all
[1:30:41] those things. I believe there's there
[1:30:42] are things more in them. But we've got
[1:30:44] to we've got to unlock it. And you say,
[1:30:46] "Well, I'm awful old." I don't care how
[1:30:48] old you are.
[1:30:51] I want to unlock
[1:30:55] things.
[1:30:57] And
[1:30:59] you know it it it's like a key
[1:31:03] a key is uh it it's no good by itself.
[1:31:10] you understand that I always think of
[1:31:13] all these things uh uh you know uh I I
[1:31:18] watched the other night a few little
[1:31:20] things about my lower back you know
[1:31:23] stretching exercises you can do you know
[1:31:27] I'm doing all these things you know and
[1:31:30] but the exercises don't do any good by
[1:31:32] themselves
[1:31:35] the the theorist says the key to
[1:31:38] strengthening your back. Well, the
[1:31:41] there's the key. You know, the little
[1:31:43] chart they give you with all the little
[1:31:45] things, but I got that key has got to go
[1:31:48] into a hand.
[1:31:50] It it's got to be yielded.
[1:31:53] You understand? So, the the key the key
[1:31:56] it it it can't it it doesn't work by
[1:31:59] itself.
[1:32:02] You understand? It's got to have a hand
[1:32:04] that yields it. So you could have a lock
[1:32:08] and and and you could have a key and a
[1:32:10] lock and and nothing's going to happen
[1:32:13] till somebody takes the key.
[1:32:17] They yield the key. The key has got to
[1:32:19] have a hand that puts it in and unlocks
[1:32:23] it. So you you've you've got to h it's
[1:32:26] got to have a hand behind it. You know,
[1:32:30] it's it's like the it's like this
[1:32:34] microphone. I I I want to read this cuz
[1:32:36] I thought it was brilliant. He said,
[1:32:38] "It's like this microphone that I'm
[1:32:40] speaking through. That microphone is
[1:32:42] mute."
[1:32:44] So I could say, "Mike,
[1:32:47] make this microphone talk.
[1:32:51] Dylan, did you forget to put in the
[1:32:53] cable?
[1:32:55] Have you got too big? You can't crawl
[1:32:57] under the stage anymore?" No.
[1:33:01] The microphone can't work by itself.
[1:33:05] It's mute
[1:33:07] until somebody activates it.
[1:33:11] So you understand that this key that
[1:33:14] we're looking for has to be activated.
[1:33:17] It doesn't do you no good to know it's a
[1:33:19] key. It doesn't do me no good to know
[1:33:22] it's a microphone. I I've got to realize
[1:33:25] that the key has been given. This
[1:33:28] microphone has been given to me so that
[1:33:31] I can activate its microphone and get my
[1:33:35] voice from here to there.
[1:33:39] So, it's got to have somebody that
[1:33:40] yields it. He says, he says the
[1:33:43] microphone that I'm speaking to, that
[1:33:45] microphone is mute unless there's
[1:33:46] something to speak through it. It cannot
[1:33:50] speak through itself.
[1:33:52] Now, we're talking about keys because
[1:33:55] people think that faith will just work
[1:33:57] by itself. No,
[1:34:02] you get it. It cannot be. It's got to
[1:34:06] have something to speak through it. So,
[1:34:08] it's not the the microphone. It's the
[1:34:11] voice, the noise behind that microphone
[1:34:16] transmitting it, the airwaves to your
[1:34:20] ear.
[1:34:23] That's the same way it is preaching the
[1:34:25] gospel.
[1:34:27] It's not we ourselves as ministers. We
[1:34:32] are not the gospel.
[1:34:37] But we are only transmitters that
[1:34:40] transmits the voice of God through our
[1:34:43] agency of men to the hearer.
[1:34:49] Oh.
[1:34:51] That's quite a commission.
[1:34:55] He says, "Visions is the same way.
[1:34:58] I know nothing to say to the church at
[1:35:01] this time concerning a vision. But if
[1:35:04] the Holy Spirit would show first me a
[1:35:07] vision, then I transmit
[1:35:11] that vision
[1:35:13] to the one that it's dedicated to."
[1:35:18] So it was not me not mine me the vision
[1:35:23] was not me it was
[1:35:27] God give the vision and I act as a
[1:35:33] transmitter to bring forth the message
[1:35:37] of the vision to the people
[1:35:41] and the key is the same way the key is
[1:35:44] only to be held in the hand that unlocks
[1:35:48] the door.
[1:35:50] See, it's got to be in a hand. Now, and
[1:35:55] in the key I'm going to speak of tonight
[1:35:59] is only one hand that can hold this key,
[1:36:03] and that's the hand of faith. It's the
[1:36:07] only thing can hold this key. And the
[1:36:10] hands hold other keys, but it takes the
[1:36:14] hand of faith for that.
[1:36:17] So there's lots of keys to That's good.
[1:36:20] You can take that down.
[1:36:24] Yeah, there's because everybody starts
[1:36:26] looking at the board and then they
[1:36:28] forget that I'm trying to transmit.
[1:36:34] So you cut that sense off because when
[1:36:37] you read, you're protected.
[1:36:42] Like a lot of people like to read the
[1:36:43] books because they don't want to hear it
[1:36:44] because when you hear the voice behind
[1:36:46] what's on them books, it brings
[1:36:48] conviction.
[1:36:50] But you can read it any way you want to,
[1:36:54] you know. I like I love people who just
[1:36:56] self- interpret the law, you know. They
[1:36:59] self interpret this, you know, do not
[1:37:01] enter. Well, that that's everybody else
[1:37:03] but me, you know, and it's just, you
[1:37:07] know, they just But when you hear it, do
[1:37:10] not enter.
[1:37:12] That means don't enter.
[1:37:15] Don't talk in the forer.
[1:37:19] That means you I'm the only one that can
[1:37:22] talk in the forer.
[1:37:27] No, keep it holy. Go to the fellowship
[1:37:30] hall. So there's there you have. So
[1:37:33] there's there's lots of keys
[1:37:36] you can. So there there there's a key to
[1:37:39] knowledge.
[1:37:41] Now you can teach somebody,
[1:37:45] you understand? You can tell them you
[1:37:47] can do it. But until they get that key,
[1:37:51] the key that makes them understand, the
[1:37:54] key that makes them uh uh comprehend it,
[1:37:58] then they get the key to learning and
[1:38:01] then they can learn.
[1:38:03] You know, we're losing the key to learn
[1:38:05] anymore because we just talked to this
[1:38:07] lady in this box
[1:38:10] and everybody's factchecking everybody.
[1:38:13] Nobody knows nothing. You know what I
[1:38:15] mean? I I just don't know how dumb the
[1:38:17] world would be.
[1:38:21] He used to remember things. He used to
[1:38:23] ha have to go places. You I know people
[1:38:27] that that will leave this church and
[1:38:29] they'll navigate home.
[1:38:36] What happened?
[1:38:38] They lost the key to their confidence.
[1:38:42] Let me tell you that a lot of this AI, a
[1:38:46] lot of this stuff on your phone, a a lot
[1:38:48] of all this stuff that's put out, all
[1:38:51] it's doing is tearing you down, tearing
[1:38:54] your confidence down, tearing down the
[1:38:56] fact that you have the ability to learn,
[1:38:58] that you have the ability to do
[1:39:00] something. I am not going to transform
[1:39:02] myself over and put myself in the form
[1:39:05] of some artificial intelligence. And
[1:39:08] people are doing that today. They're
[1:39:10] putting themselves in the hands of an
[1:39:12] artificial gospel.
[1:39:17] A gospel with no power, no fruit, no
[1:39:21] works, no no purpose, no calling.
[1:39:27] They like to sing and they like to see
[1:39:30] one another and they like to hang out.
[1:39:32] And you know, they got rid of Sunday e
[1:39:35] school uh service in the evening so they
[1:39:37] can play basketball in the gym and they
[1:39:39] can watch the Cowboys on TV or their
[1:39:42] favorite sports team or everything. Why?
[1:39:45] It's all artificial.
[1:39:49] I want the key back to the original.
[1:39:54] This is the age of the restoration of
[1:39:58] the faith of our fathers.
[1:40:01] So there has to be a key to that faith.
[1:40:07] And the question is, have we lost that
[1:40:09] key?
[1:40:13] Or where do I find the key?
[1:40:17] When you lose your key, you get
[1:40:18] desperate, don't you? And you start
[1:40:20] praying. Well, everybody pray that I
[1:40:23] find my key. You ever lost your wallet?
[1:40:26] You got to go call your credit card
[1:40:28] companies. You got to call your bank.
[1:40:30] You got to do all this. I know. I lost
[1:40:33] my wallet one time. I'll search that
[1:40:35] place
[1:40:37] everywhere. I tore the house up. And I
[1:40:40] just thought, you know, I I just I don't
[1:40:44] want to get a whole another number
[1:40:46] again. I just don't want to do it. And I
[1:40:48] never could. I And you know, it was
[1:40:51] there all the time,
[1:40:55] you know. and I searched for it. But I
[1:40:57] had to go just that one more effort,
[1:41:01] that one more showdown, that one more
[1:41:06] not giving up.
[1:41:08] And I have a little caddy at home. They
[1:41:11] It's a little thing that opens up and
[1:41:13] you put your coat over the top of it and
[1:41:15] you fold your pants over the bottom of
[1:41:18] it. And I'd fold my pants over and that
[1:41:20] wallet fell out and hung over the bottom
[1:41:24] rail.
[1:41:27] And finally after everything was done, I
[1:41:29] put everything threw everything
[1:41:31] everywhere, got the whole house tore up,
[1:41:33] you know, and Lesie was following right
[1:41:35] behind me putting things back together
[1:41:38] like any good wife does.
[1:41:41] And I found that wallet
[1:41:45] cuz that wallet was valuable to me
[1:41:49] because it opened up my bank account. It
[1:41:51] opened up my credit cards. It opened up
[1:41:53] this. had opened up that right look if
[1:41:56] if it was of no value
[1:41:59] I wouldn't have looked for it
[1:42:02] and I think that it's happening to the
[1:42:04] church is the value of original
[1:42:07] Christianity
[1:42:08] is not important to us anymore
[1:42:12] really being what we're supposed to be
[1:42:15] we just think that we're going to get
[1:42:17] there and all we're going to do is walk
[1:42:20] up there living any way we want and say
[1:42:22] hey Peter my name's on the book.
[1:42:25] You know what I mean? Say, "I can't find
[1:42:27] it." Yeah, it's there. Preacher told me
[1:42:31] my name was on the book of life. I
[1:42:32] didn't have to have no purpose in life.
[1:42:34] I didn't have to be a part of anything.
[1:42:36] I could do what everything want. I
[1:42:38] believe.
[1:42:40] Uh-uh. You lost the key, son.
[1:42:46] And so, you got to have a key. So,
[1:42:48] there's a there's a key, you know, a key
[1:42:50] to knowledge. He know it's just like he
[1:42:53] says they might teach him but he has to
[1:42:56] learn and the only way that it can be
[1:42:59] done he has to catch that key.
[1:43:06] You've got to catch
[1:43:08] that key. Catch the thing that opens it.
[1:43:12] And that's what I'm trying to get us
[1:43:14] back to this morning is catching the key
[1:43:18] that opens our faith.
[1:43:21] If you can stay with me, how many wants
[1:43:24] to know that you got the key in your
[1:43:27] hand
[1:43:28] that the key works? Prophet of God said
[1:43:31] the faith is the same faith. You take
[1:43:33] your car key and go out and you know
[1:43:35] that key is going to be at work or
[1:43:38] nowadays you press the button or
[1:43:40] whatever.
[1:43:43] So you know so you you have to catch
[1:43:45] that key
[1:43:47] and and you know so like mathematics you
[1:43:51] know uh there's a key to mathematics
[1:43:53] that you've got to have there there
[1:43:56] there's a key and there's a key to
[1:43:58] knowledge man after knowledge there's a
[1:44:00] key to science there's a key to uh
[1:44:04] researchers there there's that great key
[1:44:07] and people look for that He,
[1:44:12] you know, it's like the atom bomb or the
[1:44:15] atom. They they understood they they
[1:44:18] began to see what's holding things
[1:44:20] together and they be they were able to
[1:44:23] break it down break it down from one
[1:44:26] thing to the other to the other to the
[1:44:28] other just got, you know, uh uh and as
[1:44:32] they began to research, they finally
[1:44:34] found out that everything was held
[1:44:36] together by atoms.
[1:44:40] So they looked at that and they realized
[1:44:43] it's it's held together by atoms and
[1:44:45] then they said that so then that what
[1:44:47] they realized is they found out that the
[1:44:50] key to everything was molecules and then
[1:44:53] the molecules were made out of protons
[1:44:55] and neutrons and and they got all that.
[1:44:58] You might have have brother Joseph
[1:44:59] explain all that to you.
[1:45:02] But so they they realized but then they
[1:45:05] said if the atom could be turned around
[1:45:09] that would take what it's holding and
[1:45:12] break it apart.
[1:45:15] So now they found out that they could
[1:45:17] break everything apart by turning the
[1:45:20] atom around.
[1:45:22] So they found the key to that and and so
[1:45:25] once they found the key to it they
[1:45:27] turned it around you know like Thomas
[1:45:29] Edison
[1:45:31] you know he believed that that you that
[1:45:34] light could work he saw lightning flies
[1:45:37] he read about the lightning in the sky
[1:45:40] he began to understood that this
[1:45:42] electricity could be harnessed I want
[1:45:45] you to catch this part of it if you'd
[1:45:47] bear with me you know so uh he you know
[1:45:51] he he He had a knowledge of electricity
[1:45:54] and now he wanted to find the key what
[1:45:56] it was to get the light bulb to take
[1:45:58] this electricity and illuminate. And he
[1:46:01] said somewhere in the back of his mind
[1:46:04] something told him he could do it. What
[1:46:06] was it? It was the key that can open up
[1:46:10] the way.
[1:46:12] So part of that key for Thomas Edison is
[1:46:15] he knew that he could do it. He knew it
[1:46:19] could be done.
[1:46:23] Now I think the church is starting to
[1:46:27] lose its confidence in itself that they
[1:46:32] can do it.
[1:46:36] It's always Billy can do it and Billy
[1:46:40] passes it back to Orlando and Orlando
[1:46:43] packs it over to Big John and you know
[1:46:46] John passes it over to you know this
[1:46:49] person and it's always the other guy.
[1:46:53] That's how Nickelas and put the church
[1:46:56] in bondage. They finally passed it off
[1:46:58] onto men that claimed to be preachers.
[1:47:00] The Bible says they pointed their finger
[1:47:03] at them and said that those that are
[1:47:05] claimed to be apostles and were not.
[1:47:12] But you can't pass it off.
[1:47:17] Each one of you has a key that's
[1:47:20] specific to you.
[1:47:25] what God wants to unlock in you, your
[1:47:29] calling, your purpose, your virtues,
[1:47:32] your strengths,
[1:47:34] your character,
[1:47:39] and I'm telling you, it's got to be
[1:47:41] unlocked.
[1:47:43] Elsewhere, bumps on the church pew.
[1:47:48] Like I said, we might as well change the
[1:47:50] name of our church to we're right and
[1:47:52] everybody else is wrong tabernacle.
[1:47:57] without evidence.
[1:47:59] All of you know I can squat 1,000
[1:48:02] pounds.
[1:48:03] I knew Chris squatted 800, but you know
[1:48:06] what I mean? I
[1:48:09] I can make that claim.
[1:48:13] Right.
[1:48:16] But one day
[1:48:18] there'll come a circumstance where
[1:48:20] you've got to prove it. And I like that
[1:48:23] young preacher. He proved his calling,
[1:48:28] you know. So Thomas Edison, he'd just
[1:48:30] sit there and he eat a sa a sandwich,
[1:48:33] right? He he wouldn't uh he wouldn't
[1:48:36] stop. He knew it could be done.
[1:48:39] That was the beginning of the key.
[1:48:42] He had the knowledge, but he knew it
[1:48:46] could be done.
[1:48:52] Let us move on. I like this this
[1:48:55] knowledge too. It the the little cartoon
[1:48:59] artist in
[1:49:02] in Kansas City. He would draw cartoons
[1:49:05] and the papers keep kept telling him
[1:49:08] that he couldn't uh
[1:49:11] he was no good.
[1:49:14] But he knew he could do this.
[1:49:17] He he was a cartoon artist. It's what he
[1:49:20] wanted to do. He felt his callings. He
[1:49:22] believed in animation. He believed in
[1:49:26] that that it could be done. And so, you
[1:49:30] know, they he kept he kept going and
[1:49:35] then you know the story. One day he's in
[1:49:36] his little shack he rented or whatever
[1:49:38] and he saw a mouse
[1:49:41] and he'd been told he couldn't do it.
[1:49:43] He'd been told of all the dangers. He'd
[1:49:46] been told he'd starve to death. He he
[1:49:48] was told to go find something else. go
[1:49:51] take pictures, go write newspaper
[1:49:53] articles, anything but this.
[1:49:57] But he believed he he believed who he
[1:50:00] was.
[1:50:04] In perfect faith, the prophet of God
[1:50:06] says, "Can't we believe who we are, who
[1:50:08] the word says we are? Can't we believe
[1:50:11] that we are the church that's going to
[1:50:13] be empowered, that the works that I do,
[1:50:16] that you should do also?"
[1:50:18] And then let's take it farther from the
[1:50:20] church. Can't you believe that you're
[1:50:22] the person
[1:50:25] that's been called to do these works
[1:50:29] that you've got a place to play. You've
[1:50:32] got a piece in the puzzle and God wants
[1:50:35] to unlock your life
[1:50:40] where you're confident.
[1:50:44] And I like what he what he said here. He
[1:50:47] said
[1:50:49] he said and there's this there's the
[1:50:51] story of Mickey Mouse was born. Now it's
[1:50:54] a multi-millionaire
[1:50:56] Walt Disney.
[1:50:59] Why? He had something in his hand and he
[1:51:02] knowed he held it.
[1:51:07] He knew it was in his heart. Don't you
[1:51:11] believe that it's in your heart to be a
[1:51:13] believer? You're you can't be waring
[1:51:16] back and forth whether you're a believer
[1:51:18] or not. You might not be a very good
[1:51:21] one.
[1:51:23] You know what I mean? But if you could
[1:51:25] find the key to make you better,
[1:51:30] he said, but he he knew he he said in
[1:51:33] his hand and he knew he held it and he
[1:51:37] knowed he could do it. And that's the
[1:51:41] way every great achievement is made when
[1:51:45] men and women have something in their
[1:51:47] hand and they know they can do it.
[1:51:55] I'm asking that because these are the
[1:51:59] keys that I think that we've lost. I
[1:52:02] know I can do this. I know I can lay my
[1:52:05] hands on the sick. I know I can kneel
[1:52:08] down in prayer and he'll hear me. I know
[1:52:11] that I can lay a pattern of good works
[1:52:14] in my life. I know if I sow, I'll reap.
[1:52:20] I know these things work. Let's
[1:52:24] but we don't believe they'll work for
[1:52:26] me.
[1:52:29] They work,
[1:52:31] but I'm not the possessor of it. And
[1:52:35] that when you lose that key that that
[1:52:38] key was given to you,
[1:52:42] he called you. He elected you. He chose
[1:52:46] you for this age to perform the part of
[1:52:49] this bride that you are.
[1:52:52] You got to make it personal. It's an
[1:52:55] individual affair.
[1:52:57] You got to know I can do this.
[1:53:02] I can overcome.
[1:53:05] I can climb that mountain. I can come
[1:53:08] out of this valley. I I I I can possess
[1:53:11] the gates of the enemy. I can overcome.
[1:53:15] I am an overcomer.
[1:53:17] It doesn't matter if you've done it yet,
[1:53:20] as long as you know you can.
[1:53:33] You know, it's like polio.
[1:53:37] You know, a man, he went to the hospital
[1:53:39] and he saw all these people on iron
[1:53:42] lungs.
[1:53:45] all these people in terrible condition
[1:53:48] and it tore him up.
[1:53:51] And he realized he said there's got to
[1:53:55] be something that can undo this.
[1:54:03] Don't you think when you got a demon
[1:54:06] bothering you or you got a habit
[1:54:10] or you're possessed with lust or you're
[1:54:12] possessed with alcohol or tobacco or
[1:54:16] you're possessed with anger, you're full
[1:54:19] of bitterness,
[1:54:22] there ought to be something somewhere
[1:54:23] that says there's something that can
[1:54:25] undo this.
[1:54:30] There's something that can undo this in
[1:54:34] my life.
[1:54:36] I don't care if I inherited it. I don't
[1:54:39] care what the doctors described it as.
[1:54:42] I I don't care what they say. They they
[1:54:46] they they they didn't have a cure.
[1:54:50] But they started
[1:54:52] giving stamps. They started collecting
[1:54:54] money and boots. They started doing
[1:54:56] everything because this evil thing was
[1:54:59] working its way across the country and
[1:55:02] people begin to stand up and say there's
[1:55:04] got to there's got to be something that
[1:55:06] that beats it. This is the way they feel
[1:55:09] about cancer. They're doing cancer
[1:55:11] research everywhere. They've got to say
[1:55:13] something's got to be able to undo this.
[1:55:15] Something's got to be able to stop this.
[1:55:19] And they're looking for the key.
[1:55:24] There's people that their their their
[1:55:26] mind doesn't connect to their limbs and
[1:55:30] and and and they're studying right now.
[1:55:32] There's got to be a way to get that
[1:55:34] signal from that man. Whether we put a
[1:55:37] chip and and put a receiver that you can
[1:55:40] send a thought from here to here and
[1:55:43] make your hand work.
[1:55:45] They look at it and this is in the
[1:55:47] natural. They look at a condition. They
[1:55:51] look at something. And they said,
[1:55:52] "There's got to be a key somewhere that
[1:55:55] can undo this."
[1:55:59] Hallelujah.
[1:56:01] And if we look at our lives and I see my
[1:56:04] weaknesses, I've got to ask myself, my
[1:56:06] heart, I believe there's something
[1:56:08] somewhere that can undo this.
[1:56:13] There's got to be a key. Yes, sir.
[1:56:21] And have we lost that key?
[1:56:24] That's our question. And if we've lost
[1:56:27] it, what do we have to do?
[1:56:30] We got to look for it.
[1:56:34] If you've got a complex and you're
[1:56:36] always feeling that you're down and
[1:56:39] nobody likes you and you feel yourself
[1:56:41] crawling into a hole.
[1:56:44] I I lived in that hole.
[1:56:49] You would have never seen me here.
[1:56:52] I don't want to put myself in a position
[1:56:54] where I'm criticized.
[1:56:57] I don't like putting myself in a
[1:56:59] position where I get my feelings hurt.
[1:57:01] I've had people that I've stood with.
[1:57:03] They've been my friends. I've taken them
[1:57:05] to work time after time again. I've
[1:57:08] spent every time and just for some
[1:57:10] reason someday they just cut me off
[1:57:15] just like I don't exist.
[1:57:19] You know, it's easily done. You just
[1:57:21] pick anyone and just pretend like you
[1:57:23] never have met.
[1:57:25] Just
[1:57:27] I think what did I do? And I walk around
[1:57:30] day after day. What did I do wrong?
[1:57:32] Where did I offend this pe person? I'm
[1:57:34] turning pages in my life. How do I make
[1:57:37] it right? And I become burdened.
[1:57:41] And I say to myself, I don't have to
[1:57:43] live like this.
[1:57:44] I don't just stay up all night praying.
[1:57:46] I don't have to yell at people.
[1:57:53] But I don't know. There's something in
[1:57:55] me. I want you to go to heaven.
[1:57:58] I want you to be empowered.
[1:58:00] I want you to overcome.
[1:58:03] Something brought me from that hole
[1:58:08] because we have a God that can do
[1:58:10] exceedingly abundantly above what we can
[1:58:12] ask or think.
[1:58:15] So you got to have that
[1:58:17] you got to have that that that key. So
[1:58:22] never tiring,
[1:58:25] never giving up. That key laid
[1:58:28] somewhere. There was something would
[1:58:31] inoculate them to it and they were
[1:58:33] determined
[1:58:35] to find it.
[1:58:39] It don't It don't matter.
[1:58:42] Don't look at the lock.
[1:58:47] Don't look at the door. Don't look at
[1:58:50] the vault.
[1:58:53] There's people that know I can get in
[1:58:55] that vault.
[1:58:58] I'll crack that thing.
[1:59:03] Oh, this is a multronic some I if if
[1:59:07] they put it together, it can be undone.
[1:59:12] If man put it together, it can be
[1:59:14] undone. If Satan put it on you, God can
[1:59:17] undo it.
[1:59:21] It came from someplace. It's got to go
[1:59:24] back to some place.
[1:59:29] It's just when are we going to stand up
[1:59:33] and say, "I'm not going to take this no
[1:59:35] more. I'm not going to be in this mental
[1:59:37] condition. I'm not going to live with
[1:59:39] this temper. I'm not going to live with
[1:59:41] this lust. I'm not going to live like
[1:59:43] this. Something brought this into my
[1:59:45] life. I don't care what it was, but
[1:59:48] there's a key somewhere to undo it.
[1:59:56] It can be taken off of me.
[2:00:00] I just got to find that key. And I've
[2:00:04] got to never tire till I find it.
[2:00:09] Some of you are real sweet people and
[2:00:12] you just got an old bitter, crabby,
[2:00:15] nagging, complaining side to you.
[2:00:20] Never happy.
[2:00:24] You know, buy a fox coat and you say, "I
[2:00:27] want a mint coat."
[2:00:31] Buy this car, you want a Mercedes. Get a
[2:00:33] Mercedes, you want a Ferrari. Get a
[2:00:36] Ferrari, you want a Lamborghini. get a
[2:00:38] Lamborghini, you want a jet plane.
[2:00:44] That's miserable.
[2:00:46] That's miserable not to be content in
[2:00:50] the state you're in.
[2:00:53] You know, you get rid of that nasty
[2:00:54] spirit, you might just get your jet
[2:00:56] plane.
[2:01:00] By that time, you don't want the dumb
[2:01:02] thing.
[2:01:03] You'd rather spend that money on your
[2:01:05] brothers and sisters.
[2:01:09] But so there there there you you you
[2:01:13] can't tire and looking for that key. It
[2:01:17] it it it's the the key is locked up to
[2:01:22] everything. So we find out that these
[2:01:23] great men that achieve something, every
[2:01:26] man and woman, even those that achieve
[2:01:30] the great works of faith,
[2:01:33] they found the key that unlocked that
[2:01:36] faith. Abraham found the key that
[2:01:40] unlocked his faith that he was willing
[2:01:43] to take his son's life.
[2:01:48] But remember, there's always going to be
[2:01:50] a challenge, you know,
[2:01:53] and and so we we find out that that they
[2:01:56] knew there was a key that laid
[2:01:59] somewhere. And there is such a thing as
[2:02:02] evil as polio, diptheria, smallpox,
[2:02:05] yellow fever, tetanus, lock jaw, and so
[2:02:08] forth. That science, these evils has
[2:02:11] been able to fight day and night till
[2:02:14] they found an inoculation for it because
[2:02:17] it's evil. It's a killer. How much more
[2:02:21] is there a key to salvation for man
[2:02:25] that's in the prison house of sin? There
[2:02:28] is a key to that door to liberate man
[2:02:32] from it.
[2:02:35] There's a key somewhere.
[2:02:38] Now, has the church lost that key? Do we
[2:02:43] know what that key is? Just bear with me
[2:02:46] for a few more minutes because if if you
[2:02:49] ever have a key,
[2:02:52] it's because it's
[2:02:55] locking up
[2:02:57] something that's worthwhile.
[2:03:00] You don't lock up junk. You set it on
[2:03:03] the curb and hope somebody comes hauls
[2:03:05] it off for you.
[2:03:08] But if it's valuable to you, you lock it
[2:03:12] up.
[2:03:15] It's valuable. So it's worthwhile.
[2:03:19] So if it's something's worthwhile and
[2:03:21] you need to get into it, you you find
[2:03:25] it.
[2:03:26] You find the key. So there's a lot of
[2:03:30] difference, remember, in knowing there's
[2:03:33] a key
[2:03:36] than you going and finding that key
[2:03:39] because your key is different than my
[2:03:41] key.
[2:03:44] the key to your heart.
[2:03:46] What's in your heart?
[2:03:49] God made a key for you. That's why every
[2:03:54] revelation is a personal revelation. We
[2:03:57] do not have a group revelation.
[2:04:01] We don't have a document that you sign.
[2:04:04] This is what we believe. Uh-uh.
[2:04:08] You get that key to your life. You know,
[2:04:11] no, there's no telling what God would
[2:04:13] have you do.
[2:04:15] You say, "Well, what happens if he wants
[2:04:17] me to wash floors?" I'd rather wash
[2:04:19] floors knowing that God wants me to wash
[2:04:23] floors and that it has an eternal
[2:04:26] purpose in his hand
[2:04:31] without knowing there's no big eyes,
[2:04:33] there's no little U's, that we're all a
[2:04:35] body fitted and joined together, and
[2:04:38] everybody's got to play their part.
[2:04:41] And I'm thankful that there's somebody
[2:04:43] there. But something that's worthwhile,
[2:04:45] I'm starting to close now. So we know in
[2:04:48] John chapter 10, if we just wanted to
[2:04:52] turn to that just to read it, he says,
[2:04:58] Jesus says this.
[2:05:10] He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[2:05:12] you, he that enterth not by the door
[2:05:15] into the sheepfold, climbth up some
[2:05:19] other way, the same as a thief and a
[2:05:21] robber. But he that enterth in by the
[2:05:25] door is the shepherd of the sheep. To
[2:05:28] him the porter openeth, and the sheep
[2:05:32] hear his voice, and he calleth his own
[2:05:36] by name, and leadth them out." And when
[2:05:39] he put forth his own sheep, he goes
[2:05:42] before them, and the sheep follow him,
[2:05:45] for they know his voice, in a stranger
[2:05:48] they will not follow.
[2:05:50] For the for they know not the voice of a
[2:05:54] stranger.
[2:05:56] And Jesus said unto them again, verily,
[2:05:58] verily say unto him, I am the door of
[2:06:02] the sheep. A amen. it. And all that ever
[2:06:07] came before me are thieves and robbers,
[2:06:11] but the sheep did not hear them. I am
[2:06:14] the door.
[2:06:16] By me. If any man enter in, he shall be
[2:06:20] saved, and shall not go in and out, and
[2:06:24] shall go in and out, and find pastures.
[2:06:28] The thief cometh not, but for to steal,
[2:06:31] and to kill and destroy. I am come that
[2:06:35] they might have life and that they might
[2:06:38] have it more abundantly. I am the good
[2:06:41] shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his
[2:06:43] life for a sheep. So there's a door.
[2:06:49] So there's a we have this key that we
[2:06:53] can open this door and he's that door.
[2:06:58] So there there there's a key to healing.
[2:07:04] right there. There there's there's a key
[2:07:07] to peace.
[2:07:09] There's a key to joy. So, there's a door
[2:07:12] to healing.
[2:07:14] There's a door to peace. There's a door
[2:07:18] to joy. There's a door to love. And
[2:07:22] Jesus is that door. And the key that
[2:07:26] opens that door is faith.
[2:07:31] But it lies behind the door
[2:07:35] because it's worthwhile.
[2:07:39] And when when you start trying to
[2:07:41] compare the things of the world, let me
[2:07:43] say this, that the things and the
[2:07:45] sufferings of this world are not worthy
[2:07:48] to be compared to the things that God
[2:07:51] has for them that love him.
[2:07:54] So, you know, and and so the the faith
[2:07:57] is what unlocks that door. And now
[2:08:00] that's the question this morning. And
[2:08:02] just to in closing to bring this little
[2:08:05] thought to you that you could we could
[2:08:08] grab a hold of it
[2:08:11] is that we've got to be able to open
[2:08:14] that door.
[2:08:17] We've got to have that key in our hand
[2:08:20] that opens our door. We've got to know
[2:08:23] that there's something behind that door
[2:08:26] that's worthwhile.
[2:08:30] And it's only locked to the unbeliever
[2:08:34] because the only person that can unlock
[2:08:36] that door is faith.
[2:08:39] Your deliverance is behind that door.
[2:08:43] If you believe that there's there that
[2:08:46] you've got a problem
[2:08:48] and that you don't want that problem,
[2:08:51] then just like all those great achievers
[2:08:54] did, they knew that there was something
[2:08:56] that could take this problem off of
[2:08:58] them. And that lied behind that door.
[2:09:03] That door where you could go in and out
[2:09:06] freely.
[2:09:08] You didn't have to pack that chain. You
[2:09:10] didn't have to pack that burden. You
[2:09:12] didn't have to pack that doubt. You
[2:09:14] didn't have to pack that fear. If you
[2:09:17] could open that door
[2:09:22] behind there was something worthwhile
[2:09:30] that would
[2:09:33] give you the deliverance,
[2:09:36] the joy, the peace.
[2:09:39] But you the key to that is you've got to
[2:09:42] believe it's possible.
[2:09:44] It can be done.
[2:09:50] If you're changed, when that guy done
[2:09:52] down, he had the key to those chains.
[2:09:56] We sing the song, Jesus breaks every
[2:09:58] chain. He breaks every feather.
[2:10:04] But when we we begin within ourselves,
[2:10:07] now I'm not talking about our group
[2:10:09] thing here this morning. What quote
[2:10:12] unquote we believe? I'm talking about
[2:10:15] what do I believe? Do I believe I can
[2:10:18] overcome? Do I believe he can deliver
[2:10:21] me? Do I believe I can get the victory?
[2:10:26] You said, I've had this for 30 years.
[2:10:31] They had diseases a lot longer than that
[2:10:33] till someone believed they could un
[2:10:35] undone and they went looking for the
[2:10:38] key.
[2:10:42] Have we quit looking?
[2:10:44] Have we lost it? It's not so bad that
[2:10:46] we've lost it.
[2:10:49] The sad part's when we quit looking for
[2:10:51] it.
[2:10:53] What happens if we they quit looking for
[2:10:55] the cure to polio
[2:10:58] or dtheria?
[2:11:00] You know, I just got a tetanus shot and
[2:11:03] a yellow fever shot and a some other
[2:11:06] shot and some other pill. Man, there
[2:11:09] ain't a disease in the world that can
[2:11:11] touch me now.
[2:11:14] But really, I had it all along.
[2:11:18] But I didn't want to have no questions.
[2:11:22] So we this is what we're asking
[2:11:24] ourselves this morning is that
[2:11:28] that the key is faith.
[2:11:34] Okay. And and and so when we ask the
[2:11:39] question, have I have I lost that key or
[2:11:43] what is that key? How does that key fit?
[2:11:47] Where does the key fit? Well, the key of
[2:11:49] faith only fits in the word.
[2:11:53] Okay. Now, so I want to say this and
[2:11:56] this is where I think the church and the
[2:11:59] prophet of God said in this message that
[2:12:01] the church lost.
[2:12:04] So they lost this part of the key
[2:12:08] and when when you lose this part of it,
[2:12:10] the key don't work.
[2:12:13] But there's a lot of difference in
[2:12:16] believing for something
[2:12:19] and believing in something.
[2:12:24] You know, a lot of times fans go to
[2:12:26] games and they hold up these big signs
[2:12:30] that say, "We believe.
[2:12:33] We believe." Well, what are they doing?
[2:12:37] That's that's the they're hoping.
[2:12:42] They're wishing.
[2:12:44] They're looking for a result.
[2:12:46] They're looking for an outcome.
[2:12:49] So, they're believing for an outcome.
[2:12:52] I'm believing for a job. I'm believing
[2:12:55] for for that. I'll I'll be well. I I'm
[2:12:58] believing this. I'm believing that. If
[2:13:01] And
[2:13:03] I know this is going to sound terrible,
[2:13:06] but that's not the key.
[2:13:10] You're wanting a result.
[2:13:13] You're hoping for a result. You're
[2:13:16] hanging on to a result. But that
[2:13:18] emotion,
[2:13:20] that feeling,
[2:13:22] that desire to have this come to pass
[2:13:26] doesn't open the door.
[2:13:30] It's not what opens the door. It's not
[2:13:33] what makes it come alive. It It's not
[2:13:36] what it's It's. not what turns the lever
[2:13:39] or turns the knob. When the prophet of
[2:13:43] God said, "I'm going to kill that
[2:13:44] grizzly."
[2:13:46] Why did he say that? It didn't matter
[2:13:49] the conditions, but his key wasn't the
[2:13:54] condition.
[2:13:55] The key wasn't, "I'm wanting to kill a
[2:13:58] grizzly or I'm hoping I kill a grizzly
[2:14:02] or I believe I'm gonna kill a grizzly."
[2:14:05] He had one thing. He said, "God said so,
[2:14:10] and I don't know how it's going to get
[2:14:12] there,
[2:14:17] and the showdown was there."
[2:14:21] And I wonder how many people withdraw
[2:14:24] the key because they're afraid it won't
[2:14:27] work.
[2:14:31] They'll take it into consideration. You
[2:14:33] mean my family might get sick?
[2:14:38] Well, we went to this place to get our
[2:14:40] things and the lady sat us down and she
[2:14:42] says, "Don't sit on the ground.
[2:14:45] There's worms over there
[2:14:49] and don't wear blue
[2:14:51] cuz the fly will bite you.
[2:14:54] And don't do this and don't do that and
[2:14:57] and everything." And I thought, "My
[2:14:59] goodness gracious, what are you trying
[2:15:00] to do? not get me to go.
[2:15:06] No, I didn't want to go.
[2:15:08] In fact, I wasn't going to go to Congo.
[2:15:13] The uh I was going to go preach this
[2:15:15] meeting. I told the brother I would two
[2:15:17] years ago. I wanted to keep my word. So,
[2:15:20] the invite came to me, come preach it.
[2:15:22] And then this poor brother got ill.
[2:15:25] Can I talked to brother Manet about? And
[2:15:27] he said, "Brother, if he's this sick and
[2:15:28] he's going to have these operations,
[2:15:30] there's no way he'll be back for the
[2:15:31] meeting." So I said, "Okay."
[2:15:35] I got invited to this meeting. I'll go
[2:15:37] to this meeting. So I get all my
[2:15:39] tickets, everything to go to this
[2:15:40] meeting. Phone rings. We can't have the
[2:15:43] meeting.
[2:15:46] Oh yeah, we can't get the venue,
[2:15:50] but come anyway. And then come back. I
[2:15:52] said, "Well, you know, it just, you
[2:15:55] know, I just don't, you know, Brother
[2:15:57] Hayes isn't flying my private jet, you
[2:16:00] know what I mean?" So, uh, I, you know,
[2:16:04] so I said, "Okay." Then the phone rings
[2:16:06] and the brother says, "No, I'm not going
[2:16:08] to go do my operation. I'm going to
[2:16:09] dedicate my church first."
[2:16:13] Well, I don't care what the obstacles
[2:16:15] are.
[2:16:17] That's where God wanted me to go. It's
[2:16:18] where he wanted me to go in the first
[2:16:20] place.
[2:16:21] Don't matter if you try to get out of
[2:16:23] it.
[2:16:25] You don't need to make excuses for God.
[2:16:27] God can get it done.
[2:16:30] Just make sure you're doing every bit of
[2:16:33] your part.
[2:16:35] If God you feel God called you, then you
[2:16:37] hang in there.
[2:16:39] That guy was called to the mission
[2:16:40] field. He didn't care what the obstacle
[2:16:42] was. He says, "I'm going. If you guys
[2:16:45] don't want to send me, I'll get there.
[2:16:51] because he believed in if God sends you,
[2:16:54] he'll take care of you.
[2:16:58] And so, so believing for something isn't
[2:17:02] the same as believing in something.
[2:17:07] Now, I want to lay this point in here if
[2:17:10] I could from even for myself.
[2:17:13] And in closing this morning,
[2:17:16] faith resting place is the word of God.
[2:17:23] The faith only fits in the word.
[2:17:29] So you don't you don't believe that. I'm
[2:17:34] not believing for my healing. I'm not
[2:17:37] believing for my deliverance. I'm not
[2:17:40] believing for this. But what our faith
[2:17:43] connects to is God said,
[2:17:46] "I am the Lord thy God that healthth all
[2:17:49] your diseases."
[2:17:52] Now, that's what you believe in.
[2:17:58] No matter how dark it get, your faith
[2:18:01] isn't the hope for the result.
[2:18:04] Your faith is the belief in what's being
[2:18:07] said. Brother Abraham's faith was in the
[2:18:11] fact that God said he'd kill that
[2:18:13] grizzly.
[2:18:16] He wasn't resting
[2:18:19] in the guide. He wasn't resting in the
[2:18:22] condition. He wasn't resting in anything
[2:18:24] else. His faith wasn't in, oh, I hope I
[2:18:27] get this Grizzly. I I believe I'm going
[2:18:30] to get this Grizzly. It wasn't in that.
[2:18:33] Faith only fits
[2:18:37] in the key of God's word,
[2:18:42] the door.
[2:18:44] You know what people do nowadays? They
[2:18:46] change the lock.
[2:18:51] I'll just change it and fit it into
[2:18:53] something else.
[2:18:55] I'll create a circumstance. I'll create
[2:18:59] a scenario.
[2:19:01] if this happens and that happens and
[2:19:03] this happens and they find everything
[2:19:06] else to build their faith up. But the
[2:19:08] key,
[2:19:12] it's understanding the key,
[2:19:17] the key is what he said.
[2:19:21] I believe what he said.
[2:19:26] Now, this is the part I hope we don't
[2:19:27] miss.
[2:19:32] Alls I know is this unlocks.
[2:19:38] But there's something else about a key.
[2:19:40] The same key that unlocks locks.
[2:19:47] I want my healing.
[2:19:50] So I believe by his stripes I am healed.
[2:19:54] I'm not looking at nothing else. I'm
[2:19:57] just looking at that promise. I believe
[2:19:59] that
[2:20:03] how I don't know.
[2:20:07] Did he say it?
[2:20:10] Do I believe it? If I have that faith to
[2:20:14] believe that word, that key unlocks the
[2:20:19] faith and all the power that's behind
[2:20:22] that door.
[2:20:24] What I
[2:20:26] when we come to understand this that the
[2:20:30] key that opens that door
[2:20:33] is the same key that locks up
[2:20:37] my sickness.
[2:20:42] I don't have to lock it up.
[2:20:44] The one key
[2:20:48] that fits into that word
[2:20:53] opens that door.
[2:20:56] And behind that door, it's the door to
[2:20:59] my healing.
[2:21:02] And faith in that promise opens the
[2:21:06] promise to you. And all the power that's
[2:21:10] contained in that promise.
[2:21:15] So the promise has the key. All you have
[2:21:19] to do is have the key that unlocks that
[2:21:21] door because that same key will lock up
[2:21:28] the sickness.
[2:21:31] And we've lost that.
[2:21:35] We've lost the fact that where our faith
[2:21:38] lies is it lies in the word of God. Now
[2:21:41] Jesus is the door to all those things
[2:21:44] and faith is the key that unlocks the
[2:21:47] door. Now if Jesus is the door to all
[2:21:50] these promises of God, faith in his
[2:21:54] finished work unlocks every door to
[2:21:57] every treasure that's inside the kingdom
[2:22:01] of God.
[2:22:02] Faith is the key that unlocks every
[2:22:06] promise he makes. The key of faith does
[2:22:10] that faith in his finished work. It's
[2:22:14] the key that we're preaching on.
[2:22:19] Just think of that. The the door to
[2:22:22] peace, the door to everything. Hebrews
[2:22:26] 13
[2:22:27] 11th chapter, we all those great prison
[2:22:31] houses that man comes out of. Therefore,
[2:22:33] I believe in God's full gospel. Every
[2:22:37] word of God that turns the power of God
[2:22:40] loose,
[2:22:42] that turns his blessings to the people,
[2:22:45] it's the key to the door that unlocks.
[2:22:50] Just think of it. That's the key to the
[2:22:53] door that unlocks.
[2:22:56] These great heroes of faith, these great
[2:22:59] men of the Bible, they had that key.
[2:23:02] That's the reason they could stop the
[2:23:04] mouth of lions, quench the violence of
[2:23:06] fire, escape the edge of the sword,
[2:23:08] bring the dead back to life again, do
[2:23:11] all kinds of miracles because they held
[2:23:13] that key that they knowed it worked
[2:23:17] because it was a scriptural
[2:23:20] [Music]
[2:23:21] key.
[2:23:25] The promise gives you the key.
[2:23:29] If you believe the promise,
[2:23:32] your faith opens that door to you.
[2:23:38] It It's not believing in the result.
[2:23:41] It's not having a plan for the result.
[2:23:44] It's not whating you want to happen. You
[2:23:47] may never be sick a day in your life and
[2:23:51] you can still say, "By his stripes, I am
[2:23:54] healed." Amen.
[2:23:57] You may not have to be a deliverer or
[2:23:59] have any trouble, but you still seize
[2:24:02] that word and you say, "He's the God
[2:24:04] that deliverth me from all my troubles.
[2:24:07] I don't even have to see the trouble. I
[2:24:10] just believe I've got the key that
[2:24:12] unlocks that power.
[2:24:18] He covers me.
[2:24:21] He watches over me.
[2:24:24] I have the key.
[2:24:29] I believe
[2:24:31] and and so just say this,
[2:24:36] you know, a key that lock
[2:24:40] unlocks too. You can loose or bind.
[2:24:44] That's right. The same key locks
[2:24:47] unlocks.
[2:24:48] that the key that locks can lock up.
[2:24:54] That's exactly see because it works both
[2:24:58] ways.
[2:25:01] It works both ways. How pitiful
[2:25:05] it is that the church have ever lost its
[2:25:10] vision of that.
[2:25:14] What a sad thing it is when the church
[2:25:17] sold itself out to creeds as they've
[2:25:20] done today
[2:25:23] when we're called
[2:25:25] to unity.
[2:25:27] See, we're so interested in unlocking.
[2:25:34] We're so interested in getting this tied
[2:25:36] down and getting this sickness tied down
[2:25:38] and getting this deliverance and getting
[2:25:40] out of our trouble and getting out of
[2:25:42] our finance and getting out of this and
[2:25:45] we're trying to believe for this and
[2:25:47] we're trying to believe for that and we
[2:25:49] lo That's not the key.
[2:25:52] You can believe for it all you want.
[2:25:55] That's not what opens the door.
[2:25:58] But when you go there and you take that
[2:26:02] key and you say, "I believe he said that
[2:26:04] the righteous shall not beg. Lord, I
[2:26:08] confess all my sins.
[2:26:11] I don't I'm not I don't have to change
[2:26:13] what I'm doing. All I've got to do is
[2:26:16] put all my faith in that key that I will
[2:26:22] not have to bake bread." And when that
[2:26:25] key
[2:26:27] unlocks that door, your faith unlocks
[2:26:32] that door. He comes back and unlocks up
[2:26:36] everything that hinders you.
[2:26:40] You don't have to know both sides of it.
[2:26:43] You've got to know one thing. The church
[2:26:46] has got to get their eyes back. And I
[2:26:49] know it sounds so simple and so petty.
[2:26:51] That's why I want you to take it
[2:26:53] personally. Look at yourself.
[2:26:57] Are you holding yourself down?
[2:27:00] Are you defeating yourself?
[2:27:05] Are you imprisoning yourself?
[2:27:09] Are you saying woes for me that I'm in
[2:27:11] this prison? Woes for me.
[2:27:16] Peter and them got in the prison. What
[2:27:17] did they do? They went to praising God.
[2:27:20] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord, that I
[2:27:22] could bear these stripes. I believe when
[2:27:24] what I believe I believe it. I preached
[2:27:27] it to him. I'm willing to die for it. I
[2:27:30] believe it with all my heart. And all of
[2:27:32] a sudden, those doors come open
[2:27:35] because their faith
[2:27:39] set them free.
[2:27:43] And when we get back
[2:27:46] to get rid of the wishing, I wish I
[2:27:48] didn't do this. I wish I didn't do that.
[2:27:51] I wish I didn't get mad. I wish I didn't
[2:27:53] do this. Or you say, I believe I'm not
[2:27:56] going to get mad no more. I I'm I'm I'm
[2:27:58] I made up my mind. I'm going to wake up
[2:28:01] tomorrow with smiles on my face. I'm
[2:28:04] just going to love everybody. You know,
[2:28:06] I feel that way till I meet the first
[2:28:08] person.
[2:28:12] And I think, man, this world's a
[2:28:13] miserable place to live.
[2:28:17] But if I think I've got something,
[2:28:20] I possess something.
[2:28:22] You say David, faith is a gift of God.
[2:28:28] But I've lost the key.
[2:28:31] So I'm not opening the doors.
[2:28:34] I'm not opening the benefits that are
[2:28:36] there for me. I'm not opening the peace
[2:28:40] that's there for me, the joy that's
[2:28:42] there for me. Oh, I want to be happy.
[2:28:45] I'm believing to be happy. Don't stop.
[2:28:51] You've got the key.
[2:28:54] You got the promise.
[2:28:56] It's by these exceedingly great and
[2:29:00] precious promises that we're partakers
[2:29:03] of the word of God. If he gives you the
[2:29:06] promise,
[2:29:09] he doesn't give you the promise without
[2:29:11] giving you the key.
[2:29:15] But we've lost the key.
[2:29:18] We don't believe in it.
[2:29:22] And we don't not that we don't believe
[2:29:24] in it, but
[2:29:27] we we don't think it's us
[2:29:31] or we we we're believing for something
[2:29:36] instead of in something. We're not
[2:29:38] believing what he said.
[2:29:41] Did he say my sins are forgiven?
[2:29:44] My sins are forgiven. You say, "Brother
[2:29:47] McGary, you're a sinner. I don't care."
[2:29:49] He said,
[2:29:52] "And there may be a lot of stuff wrong
[2:29:54] with me, but if I believe that that key
[2:29:58] that believes in my salvation will bring
[2:30:01] my body into into conformance and into
[2:30:06] the image
[2:30:08] of him.
[2:30:10] It will perform its work. It'll un it'll
[2:30:13] lock up everything about me that's not
[2:30:16] him if I believe. But if I let my
[2:30:20] unbelief,
[2:30:23] I let all the things in my life that are
[2:30:26] not locked up keep me from inserting the
[2:30:30] key, they will never be taken care of.
[2:30:34] But if I can believe that word and
[2:30:37] believe that promise and insert that key
[2:30:42] and say that promise is mine, the very
[2:30:45] thing that unlocks my victory locks
[2:30:48] everything else up.
[2:30:53] And he said, "It's amazing
[2:30:58] that we're trying to lock up
[2:31:01] instead of unlock.
[2:31:03] Lord, let my faith
[2:31:06] unlock to me today. What's the purpose
[2:31:09] of my life? What's the reason? What is
[2:31:12] my heart's desire? You promise you give
[2:31:15] me my heart's desire. What is it about
[2:31:18] me, Lord, that's not right?
[2:31:23] Lord, you said that you'd give me peace.
[2:31:26] You said that my light could so shine
[2:31:29] that my good works would glorify you. Do
[2:31:32] you believe that's you? Do you believe
[2:31:35] you can have good works that glorify the
[2:31:38] father? Do you see yourself as an
[2:31:41] overcomer?
[2:31:43] All those men have one key to their
[2:31:45] faith is they believe it could be done.
[2:31:48] In the rascal I am, I believe that God
[2:31:53] can mold me into the image of his son
[2:31:58] because he said Calvary had the power to
[2:32:00] do it and I believe it with all my
[2:32:04] heart. Have faith. Look for the key.
[2:32:08] Find your key.
[2:32:11] Find your faith in the word of God. Find
[2:32:15] what it is in you that will open the
[2:32:19] kingdom to you. Don't stop. Look for it
[2:32:24] till you find it because it exists
[2:32:29] and you can have it
[2:32:32] and you can be everything that you want
[2:32:35] to be. God bless you this morning if the
[2:32:37] musicians would come. Brother Billy
[2:32:42] Let's
[2:32:52] all stand this morning.
[2:32:59] Let's sing. You hold my every moment,
[2:33:01] man. I believe is you this morning.
[2:33:04] Amen. That we may have that key of faith
[2:33:06] and that we can insert it and be able to
