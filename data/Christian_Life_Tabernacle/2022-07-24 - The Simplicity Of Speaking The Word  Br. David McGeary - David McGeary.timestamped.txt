[9:50] lord we commit the service to you once
[9:52] again that you would have your way in
[9:53] jesus name amen
[9:57] good morning
[9:58] we're going to
[10:00] go ahead and turn back over to psalm 119
[10:02] this morning and
[10:04] there's a verse in there it started in
[10:06] psalm
[10:07] 119 verse 97 and the
[10:10] verse 97 has this makes a statement it
[10:12] says oh how love i thy law
[10:16] it is my meditation
[10:18] all the day
[10:20] and then it says in verse 99
[10:23] i have more understanding than all my
[10:26] teachers
[10:27] for thy testimonies are
[10:29] my
[10:30] meditation you know i got to thinking
[10:33] about that statement
[10:35] my meditation
[10:38] and it raises the question
[10:41] what is
[10:42] my meditation
[10:46] you know unfortunately like so many
[10:48] statements or
[10:50] words or
[10:51] whatnot that have become overused and
[10:55] kind of corrupted in our day
[10:57] whenever somebody says the word
[10:59] meditation it
[11:01] draws up pictures of something like
[11:03] sitting cross-legged on a beach with
[11:05] your palms together maybe some new age
[11:07] music
[11:09] you know the mental exercise that
[11:11] corporate america asks you to go through
[11:13] that's good for your mental health or
[11:16] somehow associated with an eastern
[11:18] religion or new age
[11:22] you know but meditation is quite simply
[11:25] what it is that you meditate on
[11:29] you know webster's dictionary defines
[11:31] meditate
[11:33] like this
[11:34] to focus one's thoughts on
[11:37] to reflect
[11:39] or ponder on something
[11:42] and there's different synonyms that it
[11:44] often will come up with the words that
[11:46] mean the same thing and here's some of
[11:48] the statements
[11:49] to chew on something
[11:52] to contemplate
[11:55] to consider to weigh or turn something
[11:57] over in your mind
[12:00] to mull it over
[12:02] here's a word i like ruminate
[12:04] which is the same word that's used to
[12:06] describe sheep that are chewing the cud
[12:10] meditate
[12:13] what is
[12:15] my meditation
[12:17] what am i meditating on
[12:21] what do i dwell on
[12:23] what do i have my mind on what am i
[12:25] chewing over
[12:27] right now or
[12:29] yesterday
[12:31] or tomorrow
[12:34] you know whatever the answer to that
[12:36] question is
[12:38] that is your meditation
[12:42] you know strangely enough the word
[12:43] meditation is only used six times in the
[12:45] scriptures
[12:47] only by david
[12:50] and only in the psalms
[12:52] and twice is
[12:54] some that we just answered but some that
[12:56] we just read but here's here's a verse
[12:58] psalm 5 1.
[13:00] it says give ear to my words o lord
[13:03] consider
[13:05] my meditation amen
[13:08] so david is actually asking the lord to
[13:10] look on to consider
[13:13] to observe
[13:14] the thing that david is meditating on
[13:19] here's another one
[13:21] psalm 19 14 let the words of my mouth
[13:25] and the meditation of my heart
[13:29] be acceptable in thy sight
[13:33] well that's
[13:34] that's an interesting statement the
[13:36] question is
[13:38] i wonder how much of my meditation
[13:42] is acceptable
[13:44] in his sight something he can accept
[13:49] what am i chewing on
[13:51] what am i turning over in my mind what
[13:53] am i dwelling on is that something he
[13:55] can accept
[13:58] you know paul said in ephesians 5
[14:01] that we should walk as children of the
[14:03] light
[14:05] proving
[14:07] demonstrating
[14:09] what is acceptable
[14:11] unto the lord
[14:13] is my meditation
[14:15] acceptable
[14:18] is what i meditate on is what i dwell on
[14:20] is what i'm chewing on
[14:22] acceptable
[14:24] you know what you meditate on
[14:27] has an
[14:28] effect you know there's a meditation
[14:32] that is acceptable to the lord but what
[14:34] is my meditation am i
[14:36] meditating on my circumstance
[14:39] am i
[14:41] meditating on my problems
[14:44] am i
[14:45] meditating on all the things that could
[14:47] go wrong
[14:50] in my meditation do i lay awake at night
[14:55] thinking about all the possible outcomes
[14:57] of my situation
[14:59] is that my meditation
[15:02] is my meditation the project i need to
[15:04] get done
[15:06] is it
[15:07] my education is it my career
[15:11] is it my favorite ball club
[15:14] and how well they're performing
[15:18] is it the news of the day
[15:21] social media
[15:23] gossip culture
[15:24] whatever it is is that
[15:27] what's occupying
[15:29] my meditation
[15:30] is my meditation acceptable
[15:33] to the lord
[15:36] you know what i like about
[15:37] psalm 119 here in verse 97 is
[15:41] it describes what an acceptable
[15:43] meditation is
[15:46] it says verse 97 oh how love i thy law
[15:49] it
[15:51] thy law
[15:53] thy word
[15:55] is my meditation all
[15:57] the day
[16:01] thy word is my constant meditation
[16:05] all the day that means there's no room
[16:07] for anything else
[16:10] the lord told joshua in joshua 1 8
[16:14] this book of the law
[16:16] word
[16:17] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[16:19] thou shalt meditate thereon day
[16:23] and
[16:24] night
[16:26] your constant
[16:28] meditation
[16:30] this is acceptable meditation
[16:34] that thou mayest observe to do according
[16:36] to all that is written thereon for then
[16:38] then thou shalt make thy way prosperous
[16:41] and thou shalt have good success
[16:44] joshua was told not to meditate on the
[16:46] battlefield but on the word
[16:48] not to meditate on the battle or the
[16:50] struggle but the word
[16:53] you know acceptable meditation is being
[16:56] totally committed totally focused
[16:59] totally chewing on the word
[17:01] a
[17:02] exclusive diet
[17:06] eat the book
[17:08] all of it
[17:09] let nothing remain
[17:12] until morning
[17:14] you know there's an effect of exclusive
[17:16] meditation on the word it says in verse
[17:18] 98 99 and psalm 119 that we're just
[17:20] about to read
[17:21] thou through thy commandments
[17:24] thy word
[17:26] hast made me wiser than mine enemies
[17:30] for they are ever with me
[17:33] i have more understanding than all my
[17:35] teachers
[17:36] for thy testimonies
[17:38] thy word
[17:40] is my meditation
[17:42] the effect of meditation total
[17:44] meditation on the word is overcoming
[17:46] every enemy
[17:48] and being smarter than even the experts
[17:51] and it isn't because that you're going
[17:52] to have an answer to every question
[17:55] it isn't because you're going to study
[17:57] and have a scripture ready for every
[17:58] possible thing that might come up or
[18:01] or be able to mentally conceive
[18:04] jesus said in luke 21 when he was
[18:06] talking to his disciples settle it
[18:08] therefore in your hearts not
[18:10] to meditate before what ye shall answer
[18:14] for i will give you a mouth and wisdom
[18:16] which your adversaries shall not be able
[18:18] to gain say or resist
[18:21] there's a difference between meditation
[18:23] and study
[18:24] right
[18:26] doesn't mean that you're going to have
[18:27] the answer to every possible outcome but
[18:29] here's what it does mean by being in a
[18:31] condition
[18:33] of constantly chewing on
[18:35] constantly dwelling on
[18:38] constantly thinking on the word
[18:42] doesn't matter what the need is
[18:44] or what the circumstance what
[18:46] circumstance arises or what step you
[18:48] need to take
[18:50] the moment you need to take an action
[18:53] for the moment you have a decision that
[18:56] is presented or an action that needs to
[18:58] be taken
[18:59] you'll be so influenced
[19:01] by the constant
[19:03] meditation
[19:04] on the word
[19:06] that the answer will come forth
[19:09] the step you need to take will be taken
[19:12] the decision you need to make will be
[19:13] apparent
[19:14] because your sole focus will be the
[19:17] meditation
[19:18] on his work
[19:21] so what is
[19:23] my meditation
[19:25] what am i chewing on
[19:29] you know am i meditating on the
[19:31] battlefield
[19:32] or the nightly news
[19:35] or is this book of the law not to part
[19:37] out of my mouth
[19:39] let's just read that section of psalm
[19:41] 119 verse 97 to 104 this morning
[19:45] let's read that together oh how i love
[19:47] thy law
[19:48] it is my meditation all the day
[19:51] thou through thy commandments has made
[19:53] me wiser than mine enemies for they are
[19:56] ever with me i have more understanding
[19:59] than all my teachers for thy testimonies
[20:02] are my meditation
[20:03] i understand more than the ancients
[20:05] because i keep thy precepts i have
[20:08] refrained my feet from every evil way
[20:10] that i might keep thy word i have not
[20:13] departed from thy judgments for thou
[20:15] hast taught me how sweet are thy words
[20:18] unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to
[20:21] my mouth
[20:22] through thy precepts i get understanding
[20:25] therefore i hate every false way
[20:36] amen
[20:41] oh this is the day
[20:45] this is the day that the lord has made

[33:34] god bless you
[33:36] there's a song that's been on my heart
[33:38] this week
[33:39] it's called majesty it's a very common
[33:41] song
[33:42] but the the part that i really loved
[33:46] says
[33:48] that we have kingdom authority that
[33:51] flows from his throne
[33:53] onto his own and i was thinking about
[33:55] the story brother branham gives of the
[33:57] police officer
[33:58] who didn't have very much power but the
[34:00] authority that he had would stop the
[34:03] traffic and
[34:05] last weekend uh the tape we listened to
[34:08] spoke of how the church has all the
[34:10] power
[34:11] but now the word brings the perfect
[34:13] faith to operate that power so i just
[34:15] enjoyed that phrase hope it's a blessing

[44:15] this morning our gracious heavenly
[44:16] father
[44:19] lord we just approach your throne today
[44:21] and
[44:22] ask that you lift our hearts and our
[44:24] spirits
[44:26] father that you be with
[44:29] the many of us that are on vacation at
[44:32] this time and
[44:34] traveling father may
[44:38] they enjoy your presence where

[45:24] ask you to forgive us our trespasses
[45:29] father
[45:30] the failures
[45:33] that we have
[45:35] but our confession is that
[45:38] they're under the blood
[45:39] and they're thrown in the sea of god's
[45:41] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[45:44] so we stand up this morning
[45:47] knowing that you've invited us to your
[45:50] table
[45:51] and father may we come with an appetite
[45:54] this morning
[45:55] that we could have the fullness of what
[45:58] you have for us today
[46:00] ask you to bless each one now
[46:02] in your precious and
[46:04] wonderful name we pray
[46:06] amen
[46:08] amen if you have your bibles and you
[46:10] would turn with me to the
[46:12] book of romans
[46:15] in the um
[46:18] the 10th chapter of the book of romans
[46:21] and we want to read there uh before we
[46:24] read our scriptures we just want to
[46:28] wish john and christina
[46:31] a safe trip they're going back to
[46:33] riverside
[46:34] to help with the health of her parents
[46:38] for a season so
[46:39] as they go there and and are there for
[46:43] we don't know how long of a period of
[46:44] time
[46:45] but we want to keep them in prayer and
[46:48] then brother paul
[46:49] he also uh i believe is returning back
[46:53] to brazlerville
[46:54] to work
[46:57] he's in the neurology field
[47:01] and
[47:02] he's a
[47:04] a national commodity and they don't want
[47:07] to let him go
[47:09] so um
[47:10] we're just praying that the lord will
[47:12] open it up and then soon he'll be able
[47:14] to be
[47:16] here with us
[47:17] uh for that and then i leave for my
[47:20] mom's hundredth
[47:22] birthday you know i'm real proud that my
[47:26] mom's a hundred but it it kind of lets
[47:29] everybody know how old i am
[47:32] and uh
[47:34] you know
[47:35] i i feel good i feel good
[47:38] and i i
[47:40] hold on to that and my i believe my
[47:42] mom's a testimony to it
[47:45] they did a heart surgery on my mom i
[47:48] guess almost 15 years ago
[47:50] and they asked her says why do you want
[47:52] to
[47:53] give her heart
[47:55] surgery
[47:56] you know
[47:57] and it was a traumatic thing we went
[48:00] through her heart became hard as a rock
[48:02] we were there we prayed for her she got
[48:04] through every one of those doctors have
[48:07] been gone to meet
[48:09] their reward
[48:10] but mom's still alive so we're grateful
[48:13] for that so we're gonna go do that
[48:16] and then what before we read our
[48:17] scripture i certainly apologize to you
[48:20] for the conditions
[48:21] that you're having to deal with
[48:24] i hope the
[48:25] white dust doesn't track in your carpets
[48:28] and your cars but wipe your feet real
[48:31] good
[48:32] and here in a few weeks the parking lot
[48:34] will be ready and finished and
[48:37] it it'll be good we're going in the
[48:39] right direction so let's have faith
[48:42] amen you love the lord this morning
[48:45] we just want to fellowship with you this
[48:47] morning and i hope that it can be some
[48:50] real words of encouragement to you but
[48:52] let's read in romans
[48:55] the 10th chapter
[48:57] and
[49:01] and i have
[49:03] several titles
[49:05] for
[49:05] my sermon this morning
[49:08] so in the titles you can place it
[49:12] uh the what i like to call it is the
[49:15] simplicity
[49:17] of speaking the word
[49:19] the simplicity of speaking the word
[49:24] and then
[49:25] another title i would call it
[49:28] would be the manifestation of my
[49:31] confession
[49:33] and finally
[49:34] made ready
[49:36] by my confession
[49:39] so let us read the scripture here it
[49:41] says what but what say it
[49:44] the word is nigh thee
[49:47] even in thy mouth
[49:50] and in thine heart
[49:53] that is the word of faith
[49:56] which we preach
[49:58] that if thou
[50:00] shalt confess with thy mouth the lord
[50:03] jesus
[50:04] and shall believe in thine heart
[50:09] that god hath raised him
[50:12] from the dead
[50:14] thou
[50:15] shalt be saved
[50:19] for with the heart
[50:22] man believeth unto righteousness
[50:27] and with the mouth confession is made
[50:32] unto salvation
[50:34] for the scripture saith whosoever
[50:37] believeth on him
[50:40] shall not
[50:41] be
[50:42] ashamed
[50:44] father we ask you to bless your word to
[50:46] us in your precious name we pray amen
[50:50] amen god bless you
[50:52] this morning
[50:58] we
[50:59] we know that
[51:01] god is
[51:04] hid in simplicity
[51:06] he's always
[51:07] chose that
[51:09] way of doing things
[51:11] he hides himself in simplicity and he
[51:15] reveals himself
[51:18] in the same
[51:20] and so
[51:21] in
[51:22] uh
[51:24] seeing that and thinking that in my
[51:26] heart
[51:28] i know that a lot of times there's a lot
[51:31] of emphasis
[51:33] put on this statement of speaking the
[51:36] word
[51:38] like you
[51:39] speak the word and you're going to make
[51:43] something happen
[51:45] and
[51:46] i think that's our a tendency that
[51:50] causes us sometimes to
[51:53] press an issue
[51:55] and you can't
[51:59] you can't force god to do anything
[52:03] and and but i think we have a great
[52:06] hearts desire
[52:08] to have god do something for us
[52:12] and god can only do for us what that he
[52:16] said he would do for us
[52:19] you know you can't ask god to do
[52:22] something that he didn't promise to do
[52:25] but you have a right
[52:28] to everything that he promised
[52:31] you have a right to it
[52:33] so we want to talk a little bit
[52:37] and and read to you and then we're going
[52:40] to play some
[52:43] a portion of tape
[52:45] because
[52:46] we want to talk a little bit about
[52:48] confession
[52:50] and the power of confession
[52:53] because confession is the way that a
[52:57] believer speaks the word
[53:02] you know it's not making up something in
[53:04] your mind and walking up to this piano
[53:08] and saying if you had faith
[53:12] you know uh you could uh speak to this
[53:16] uh
[53:17] piano and move uh that piano that's not
[53:22] what god promised
[53:24] he didn't promise that now we take that
[53:27] scripture and we say
[53:29] uh well he said if thou could believeth
[53:32] in thy heart thou could say to this
[53:35] mountain be moved
[53:37] or you could say to this tree be plucked
[53:40] up and uh and
[53:42] put in the sea
[53:44] but you have to understand that
[53:48] that wouldn't be in your heart
[53:51] to do that
[53:53] you understand in other words the purity
[53:55] of my heart the purpose of my heart the
[53:59] motive objective behind it is that
[54:02] you've got to even for your healing the
[54:05] prophet of god said that you've got to
[54:07] have a reason why that you want to be
[54:10] well
[54:14] now that that's quite a a quite an
[54:17] approach
[54:19] that that it's very simple
[54:22] you'd have to have a a reason
[54:26] for for doing something there's got to
[54:29] that reason has got to be generated from
[54:33] what's in your heart because a man
[54:36] believeth in his heart unto
[54:39] righteousness and that's that thing that
[54:42] we're going to end up with on the
[54:45] backside of our sermon this morning is
[54:48] the fact of the individual
[54:52] of our faith
[54:56] what it takes as an individual so we're
[55:00] talking about that we have a great
[55:02] desire
[55:03] to be ready
[55:08] i think that
[55:09] we should
[55:10] come to
[55:12] that realization that
[55:15] there is something that we are getting
[55:17] ready for
[55:19] we're not living to die
[55:22] we're dying to live
[55:26] we die daily
[55:28] daily we confess our faults
[55:31] daily we look at ourselves and we desire
[55:35] in our heart to be better and your heart
[55:39] is always what's going to finally speak
[55:43] out what's in your heart many
[55:46] people have come and asked for
[55:49] advice and not that i have advice to
[55:53] give or
[55:55] that i have any wisdom to share but
[55:59] because that i'm a pastor and they they
[56:03] they have respect of the office so
[56:06] they'd come in and
[56:08] they would say should i do this or
[56:11] should i do that
[56:12] and you find out that you could say no
[56:16] but they're going to do what's in their
[56:18] heart to do
[56:20] even the scripture said uh when when
[56:24] speaking he said do all that is in thine
[56:26] heart
[56:27] and and so there there's got to be a
[56:31] place in our heart that there's a real
[56:34] desire
[56:35] and and the real something that speaks
[56:39] out because what's in your heart is
[56:41] really what you're going to confess
[56:44] and confession is done in a lot of
[56:47] different ways you know
[56:50] just your very actions is a form of
[56:53] confession
[56:55] so i'd like to uh
[56:59] take a statement here and so we're
[57:02] talking about confession and confession
[57:06] is
[57:07] uh
[57:08] we make ourselves ready
[57:10] by our confession
[57:13] that that's the
[57:14] the way that our
[57:17] uh our very preparation
[57:21] for
[57:21] the christian life that we're going to
[57:25] live it comes from our confession
[57:29] so if i could say it like this that we
[57:32] are we are
[57:33] we can't go forward looking back
[57:36] there's no
[57:38] good in
[57:41] telling
[57:42] what that
[57:43] you were
[57:44] that's right
[57:46] if you
[57:47] you can't go forward on what that you
[57:50] were
[57:51] now we give our testimony and we say
[57:55] that this is what that i was but what
[57:58] we're confessing is what we are
[58:03] that's what our confession is and to go
[58:06] forward when you begin to think of going
[58:08] forward if if i could just express this
[58:12] in my lack of education but you're
[58:15] you're you're speaking
[58:18] what that you're going to be
[58:20] you're confessing where you're going
[58:24] you're not confessing where you've been
[58:27] you know
[58:28] uh
[58:29] you know you could say i've been here
[58:31] i've been here i've been here i've been
[58:33] here i've been here you can give all of
[58:35] a litany but when you finally get down
[58:38] to it you'll come back to where you are
[58:43] so i've been here okay but where am i
[58:46] that's where i've been but now is
[58:50] where i i all where i've been brings me
[58:54] to where i am now
[58:56] now the question is
[58:58] where am i going
[59:01] now to say that i'm going to go there i
[59:04] have to confess
[59:06] that i'm going there
[59:10] i'm going
[59:11] here and that's in the natural we would
[59:14] do that so if we could understand that
[59:17] in the spiritual it's the same thing
[59:21] you've got to confess
[59:23] where you're going you've got
[59:25] you've got to confess
[59:28] because your confession is what makes
[59:31] you ready
[59:34] and let's read a few statements and
[59:37] and and so that we can
[59:39] anchor up
[59:41] this down uh quickly
[59:44] this morning because i i believe that
[59:48] in in knowing these things
[59:50] and understanding these things and the
[59:53] power of your confession
[59:55] and understand that there is a part that
[59:59] you've got to play
[1:00:02] so in the simplicity
[1:00:05] of speaking the word
[1:00:08] people think that speaking the word
[1:00:11] makes it like it's some extra
[1:00:14] uh terrestrial
[1:00:16] uh power
[1:00:18] that you've got that you're going to
[1:00:21] you're going to
[1:00:24] uh
[1:00:25] speak the word and it's some mighty
[1:00:27] thing but the the the
[1:00:30] the the simplicity of speaking the word
[1:00:35] is so beautiful
[1:00:37] how does the believer speak the word
[1:00:44] that would be the question how do i get
[1:00:46] the faith
[1:00:48] to speak the word
[1:00:51] i i've seen it and i i've heard so many
[1:00:55] times in the
[1:00:56] uh
[1:00:57] the preaching of the gospel we get
[1:00:59] excited about speaking the word because
[1:01:04] it's a promise that's given to the bride
[1:01:07] she'll speak the word
[1:01:10] but what is she really doing when she
[1:01:13] speaks the word
[1:01:14] she's confessing
[1:01:18] what he said
[1:01:23] she's not creating new words
[1:01:28] she's believing
[1:01:30] what he said
[1:01:32] now in believing it
[1:01:34] this is what we we will point out here
[1:01:38] is that that belief cannot be held
[1:01:43] within
[1:01:44] and ever have it
[1:01:47] manifest
[1:01:48] that's right
[1:01:51] right because
[1:01:52] it's it's the manifestation
[1:01:56] of our confession
[1:01:59] is what we confess
[1:02:01] or speak
[1:02:05] i speak the word
[1:02:07] i confess
[1:02:09] the word
[1:02:10] and now that's what translates
[1:02:14] into the simplicity of the manifestation
[1:02:19] of the word
[1:02:20] and that's how i make myself ready
[1:02:25] i want to get ready the only thing that
[1:02:27] can make me ready is what
[1:02:30] the word of god
[1:02:31] look let's listen as brother brown
[1:02:34] he unfold these things
[1:02:36] he says somebody says
[1:02:39] how does divine healing
[1:02:42] does it
[1:02:43] does it last
[1:02:45] all the time
[1:02:49] now this is this is some real
[1:02:53] food for thought
[1:02:55] it lasts just as long as faith lasts
[1:03:03] and salvation lasts the same way
[1:03:07] just as long
[1:03:09] as faith lasts
[1:03:11] when you feel that you're not saved
[1:03:14] anymore you're not saved
[1:03:17] for it's by faith
[1:03:20] are you saved through grace
[1:03:23] and that's right
[1:03:26] now we're talking about the power of
[1:03:28] confession and the simplicity of
[1:03:31] speaking the word
[1:03:33] and and the the ability to overcome
[1:03:38] and make yourself ready by what you
[1:03:41] confess
[1:03:42] we know we speak of of
[1:03:45] seeing a well man
[1:03:48] and walking into it well you kind of
[1:03:51] confess
[1:03:52] the well man you have to confess what
[1:03:55] that you're going to be
[1:03:59] if you continue to confess what you are
[1:04:02] you will stay
[1:04:04] right there
[1:04:06] but you confessed and by speaking the
[1:04:10] word of confession you're actually
[1:04:13] moving forward and making yourself ready
[1:04:18] he said
[1:04:19] he says
[1:04:21] that's right when you come to the altar
[1:04:23] what do you do
[1:04:25] you confess your sins and ask god to
[1:04:28] forgive you
[1:04:29] and then in your heart
[1:04:32] now get it
[1:04:33] in your heart you have to believe
[1:04:37] that he has forgiven you is that right
[1:04:40] you have to believe that
[1:04:43] well if you don't believe he's forgiven
[1:04:45] you're going to stay right there
[1:04:48] and keep confessing and confessing year
[1:04:52] after year after year confessing
[1:04:54] confessing running to the altar you're
[1:04:57] not going forward
[1:05:01] and you're not getting ready
[1:05:07] you're stuck
[1:05:11] i think that you're stuck right there
[1:05:15] if you don't accept it
[1:05:17] and you don't believe it
[1:05:19] he
[1:05:20] said said
[1:05:22] you have to believe that he has forgiven
[1:05:25] you is that right you have to believe
[1:05:27] that
[1:05:29] then you walk away from the platform
[1:05:32] and then you have to confess it first
[1:05:36] then you are saved
[1:05:45] you can't keep it under a bushel
[1:05:48] you will lose it
[1:05:50] right
[1:05:51] now
[1:05:54] how many people have waited
[1:05:58] they believe that god's
[1:06:01] done something for them
[1:06:02] but
[1:06:03] they don't want to confess it till they
[1:06:06] see it
[1:06:11] then they're no longer confessing to
[1:06:12] their faith
[1:06:17] it's no longer faith
[1:06:21] it's no longer faith then then what it
[1:06:24] is is oh i've seen it we don't walk by
[1:06:27] sight
[1:06:28] we walk by faith
[1:06:31] now let's just follow this simplicity
[1:06:34] of speaking the word the simplicity
[1:06:38] of speaking the word we get this idea of
[1:06:42] speaking the word at some
[1:06:44] ministerial giants that speak the word
[1:06:48] the simple child can speak the word
[1:06:54] he said
[1:06:57] he said
[1:07:01] if you keep it under the bushel basket
[1:07:05] you'll lose it right now you've got to
[1:07:07] confess it
[1:07:09] and tell
[1:07:10] everyone
[1:07:12] that you're glad
[1:07:14] now what if you walk outside and
[1:07:17] somebody says there's nothing to it you
[1:07:20] just got excited at the altar
[1:07:24] how many christians on here let's see
[1:07:26] your hands all right oh my hundreds
[1:07:28] percent i believe all right
[1:07:30] each one of you god saved in the same
[1:07:33] way by faith
[1:07:36] each one of us is same the same way
[1:07:40] every single one of us god convicted our
[1:07:43] hearts we were sorry for our sins and we
[1:07:47] accepted that
[1:07:49] not by our righteousness for our
[1:07:52] righteousness as filthy rags we accepted
[1:07:55] it because he
[1:07:57] said so
[1:08:01] we accept his word
[1:08:05] in our heart and then we confess
[1:08:09] that word or speak that word in
[1:08:13] simplicity confessing what that he has
[1:08:16] done for us and say that i'm saved
[1:08:21] now when you speak it
[1:08:23] that is now what you become
[1:08:29] you become saved
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:34] because you've got to speak that that's
[1:08:37] the simplicity
[1:08:38] of speaking the word you made yourself
[1:08:41] ready
[1:08:42] by your confession
[1:08:46] but if you keep it under a bushel basket
[1:08:51] you'll lose it
[1:08:55] because you got to
[1:08:57] speak it
[1:09:02] the simplicity
[1:09:05] of speaking the word
[1:09:08] it's so simple
[1:09:10] i get embarrassed sometimes i think i'm
[1:09:13] going to come up and and we're so
[1:09:16] trying to be caught up into the
[1:09:18] mysteries but he said if i speak with
[1:09:20] the tongues of mens and angels and
[1:09:23] understand all the mysteries and have
[1:09:25] not charity it profiteth me nothing
[1:09:28] so you understand god can do things for
[1:09:31] you but they're not on unprofitable
[1:09:33] they're not profitable
[1:09:36] and they don't manifest because it's the
[1:09:39] manifestation of your confession
[1:09:44] we'll just read these statements i hope
[1:09:46] they just grab hold of you
[1:09:49] he said
[1:09:55] he says
[1:09:57] each one have we been saved the same way
[1:09:59] by faith you could come here and cry
[1:10:03] and pray
[1:10:05] and pray
[1:10:06] and cry all this week
[1:10:09] and next week
[1:10:11] and a month
[1:10:12] and you'd be still be a sinner until you
[1:10:16] accept him by faith
[1:10:20] okay so if you're coming every month
[1:10:23] right and you're at the altar saying i'm
[1:10:26] a sinner i'm a sinner i'm a sinner what
[1:10:29] are you
[1:10:34] you're confessing where you are
[1:10:38] you understand there's a difference if
[1:10:40] confessing where you are but by faith
[1:10:44] you're confessing what you're going to
[1:10:46] be
[1:10:52] he's like
[1:10:54] he said
[1:10:55] you until you accept the face is that
[1:10:57] right it's not your crying that saves
[1:11:00] you it's your faith that saves you
[1:11:04] and when you accept it
[1:11:06] you believe it and somebody says
[1:11:09] let's see if you look any different
[1:11:13] why you still got brown eyes
[1:11:16] you're just the same as you was
[1:11:20] you can't show
[1:11:22] nothing that you are saved
[1:11:25] you're only testifying of the
[1:11:29] unseen
[1:11:33] what is faith
[1:11:34] it's the evidence
[1:11:36] of things hoped for but not yet seen
[1:11:42] so abraham it was imputed to abraham for
[1:11:46] righteousness because he confessed what
[1:11:49] he was going to be the simplicity of
[1:11:53] speaking the word
[1:11:58] this
[1:11:59] simplicity
[1:12:02] when you rise up from the altar when i
[1:12:04] rose up from the altar i still had all
[1:12:06] my records
[1:12:10] i've still had a a very
[1:12:14] portrait in my
[1:12:16] place of bob dylan that was painted by
[1:12:19] an artist
[1:12:20] it probably would have been worth
[1:12:22] thousands and thousands of dollars now
[1:12:24] they came in and painted it on my wall
[1:12:27] and everything and
[1:12:29] when when i i got saved
[1:12:34] i didn't look saved
[1:12:38] everything that was around me was
[1:12:40] unsaved
[1:12:43] because i lived in an unsaved world
[1:12:47] but how was i going to change the world
[1:12:53] how was i going to make myself ready
[1:12:56] i couldn't go in there and make myself
[1:12:59] ready till i confessed it
[1:13:02] nobody could see that i was
[1:13:05] saved
[1:13:06] i looked like the same hippie
[1:13:09] i dressed like the same hippie i still
[1:13:12] lived in the same psychedelic dungeon i
[1:13:15] still had all my hippie stuff everywhere
[1:13:20] but i remember calling my cousin up and
[1:13:23] saying tommy i got saved
[1:13:27] i'm gonna
[1:13:29] paint that
[1:13:30] my walls he said don't paint that
[1:13:33] portrait
[1:13:34] he came over and took a skill saw and
[1:13:36] cut this great big gigantic portrait out
[1:13:39] of my wall
[1:13:43] at first
[1:13:44] evidence that's right my confession
[1:13:48] started
[1:13:50] to manifest
[1:13:52] because i started speaking today of
[1:13:56] speaking the word i'm saved i'm not
[1:13:59] going this way no more i'm not going to
[1:14:02] do this no more i'm going to be
[1:14:04] different
[1:14:06] and then my confession began to manifest
[1:14:10] the portrait was gone the music was gone
[1:14:13] all the psychedelic things were gone the
[1:14:16] paraphernalia
[1:14:18] was gone so eventually what took place
[1:14:21] my confession began to manifest i could
[1:14:25] start back and i could see the
[1:14:27] manifestation of my confession because
[1:14:31] it was the simplicity of speaking the
[1:14:34] word
[1:14:37] we're confessing the unseen
[1:14:41] i'm not confessing what i am i'm
[1:14:44] confessing what god promised i could be
[1:14:50] that's what i'm confessing
[1:14:53] i'm confessing i'm an overcomer
[1:14:56] i'm confessing that there's grace to
[1:14:58] overcome
[1:15:02] he says
[1:15:04] you're only testifying of the unseen
[1:15:07] your faith says you're saved then what
[1:15:10] do you do
[1:15:12] you believe you're saved
[1:15:14] then you say you're
[1:15:22] saved then you act like you're
[1:15:27] saved
[1:15:29] then you associate with those that are
[1:15:33] saved
[1:15:34] and
[1:15:35] it
[1:15:36] works righteousness
[1:15:42] you know
[1:15:45] nobody wants to go through the process
[1:15:47] anymore
[1:15:51] you confess with your mouth because
[1:15:53] those that believe are not ashamed
[1:15:58] the word is even nigh in your mouth but
[1:16:01] you confess it
[1:16:03] unto righteousness
[1:16:05] and you can and you believe in your
[1:16:07] heart under righteousness is that what
[1:16:10] the scripture says he says then you you
[1:16:13] act like you're saved and it works
[1:16:17] righteousness because that's what your
[1:16:19] heart's desire is your heart's desire is
[1:16:22] to be free
[1:16:24] you want to be free confess
[1:16:29] it's a profession of your faith
[1:16:32] he said
[1:16:36] and then everybody knows you're saved
[1:16:38] isn't that right well
[1:16:41] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:16:44] and by his stripes we were healed jesus
[1:16:47] third hebrews 3 1 is the high priest of
[1:16:51] our confession
[1:16:53] now any one of you scholars knows that
[1:16:56] the word
[1:16:59] profession is translated the same as
[1:17:02] confession he's the high priest now
[1:17:05] here it is get it now
[1:17:08] and you won't even have to come here to
[1:17:11] be healed
[1:17:13] you'll be healed right where you're
[1:17:14] sitting i believe it's possible now for
[1:17:18] people in this building to be healed
[1:17:21] right
[1:17:22] right now
[1:17:23] i've seen it i've seen the time when
[1:17:26] there wasn't a wheelchair left in the
[1:17:28] building and not a a crutch or a blind
[1:17:31] or deaf person of where thousands were
[1:17:34] sitting
[1:17:35] one night was speaking
[1:17:37] and they've seen a miracle performed by
[1:17:40] god they just accepted it right there
[1:17:43] and there wasn't a caught wheelchair or
[1:17:46] nothing
[1:17:47] but the
[1:17:49] what was emptied and they walked out
[1:17:53] then the delia illinois v-a-n-d-a
[1:17:59] illinois that's right in a big tent
[1:18:01] meeting now here's what it is friends
[1:18:04] see if you can get it if you're a
[1:18:06] christian because you believe that
[1:18:09] you're a christian
[1:18:14] now let's just hold that because we're
[1:18:16] just going to keep building
[1:18:18] here because we want to understand i
[1:18:20] want to get done with this we'll listen
[1:18:21] to 30 minutes of tape he said
[1:18:24] he
[1:18:24] said
[1:18:26] he said
[1:18:27] because you believe you're a christian
[1:18:30] and it's all settled because he's the
[1:18:33] high priest of your
[1:18:36] confession
[1:18:37] he's what is the high priest he's the
[1:18:40] administrator
[1:18:43] of your confession you confess it he
[1:18:46] performs it
[1:18:53] he said now notice he's the high priest
[1:18:55] of your confession
[1:18:57] you get what i mean
[1:19:00] what you confess you are
[1:19:03] that's what you are
[1:19:05] so that's how you're made ready by your
[1:19:08] confession
[1:19:09] you might say i'm not ready
[1:19:16] don't be stuck there
[1:19:19] lord help me get ready
[1:19:21] i'm going to do what it's necessary to
[1:19:24] get ready i'm going to get rid of this
[1:19:27] i'm going to do this by god's grace i'm
[1:19:29] going to i'm going to overcome you start
[1:19:32] confessing what that you're going to be
[1:19:35] and now he's the high priest
[1:19:39] that's going to administer
[1:19:42] your confession
[1:19:44] and he closes here and
[1:19:46] this particular tape broke off and
[1:19:49] there's not
[1:19:50] any more after these statements
[1:19:52] he says
[1:19:54] you get what i mean what you confess
[1:19:57] you are that's what you are any man will
[1:20:01] never live any further or any higher
[1:20:05] than what he believes
[1:20:08] he's
[1:20:09] living
[1:20:15] you talk about moving up
[1:20:18] you talk about coming to higher ground
[1:20:26] you take a man
[1:20:29] that's talking about drinking all the
[1:20:32] time
[1:20:33] he talks about drinking he thinks about
[1:20:36] drinking
[1:20:37] he drops right down into that category
[1:20:40] and becomes a drunkard
[1:20:43] a man that's always thinking vulgar
[1:20:45] things and looking at vulgar things he
[1:20:48] thinks of vulgar things he reads
[1:20:50] vulgarity he will become
[1:20:54] what he confesses
[1:20:58] let's go on and read
[1:21:00] a few more statements because you we
[1:21:04] where i want you to tie the service
[1:21:06] together in your own self this morning
[1:21:11] the simplicity of speaking the word
[1:21:18] is not some fantastic
[1:21:20] changing
[1:21:22] something in the natural realm
[1:21:26] because these signs follow them that
[1:21:30] believe
[1:21:32] you change what you are
[1:21:36] you make yourself ready
[1:21:39] by your confession
[1:21:42] you can't look in the mirror you're
[1:21:44] going to see
[1:21:45] what you see in the mirror
[1:21:48] but if you can look in the mirror and
[1:21:50] say you know something i'm not what i
[1:21:53] want to be
[1:21:56] i'm not what i should be but i'm not
[1:21:59] what i used to be
[1:22:01] now you've got a confession that he can
[1:22:04] act upon and move forward
[1:22:08] you you're confessing
[1:22:12] and by your confession you're making
[1:22:14] yourself ready
[1:22:17] it ain't my works
[1:22:20] it's not my power it's not by might it's
[1:22:24] but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:22:29] we we begin to confess i i confess i
[1:22:33] believe the word of god and i confess
[1:22:36] the spirit of god can convict me of sin
[1:22:39] and change me
[1:22:43] i've just initiated
[1:22:45] the process
[1:22:47] of change
[1:22:51] i have spoken
[1:22:53] to the unseen
[1:22:58] i'm not i'm not testifying to what i see
[1:23:03] faith is the evidence of things hoped
[1:23:05] for i'm hoping in my heart
[1:23:08] that i'm going to become a good better
[1:23:10] christian have more love of the spirit
[1:23:14] have these things and therefore the
[1:23:16] simplicity of speaking the word let the
[1:23:19] love of god be shed abroad in my heart
[1:23:22] by the holy spirit
[1:23:27] you want more love
[1:23:29] confess you want more love
[1:23:41] this is out of a message called law
[1:23:45] now paul speaking here of the valley
[1:23:48] or the shadow rather of the law
[1:23:52] being a shadow of good things to come
[1:23:56] could never make the worshiper perfect
[1:24:01] so
[1:24:02] oh
[1:24:03] that excites me
[1:24:05] in other words you can do all the good
[1:24:07] works and everything that you want and
[1:24:10] keep every rule and pay all your tithes
[1:24:12] and and all your offerings and do
[1:24:15] everything and it'll never make perfect
[1:24:17] there's only one thing that can make you
[1:24:19] perfect and that's the word
[1:24:24] so when you confess
[1:24:27] that he can make me perfect
[1:24:31] you've made your first step
[1:24:33] to being perfect
[1:24:36] then he goes
[1:24:38] he says
[1:24:39] then he goes on to show
[1:24:41] what the perfection is
[1:24:44] it's a strange thing
[1:24:46] that this is so much thought of people
[1:24:49] today
[1:24:50] they say
[1:24:53] well i'm weak
[1:24:57] my faith is not very much
[1:25:01] i am
[1:25:04] he says
[1:25:06] i am not a very good christian
[1:25:12] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:25:17] say
[1:25:22] you're just
[1:25:24] talking his language then
[1:25:30] see you must never say that
[1:25:33] don't never let your testimony be
[1:25:37] negative
[1:25:38] let it be positive all the time i am
[1:25:42] saved
[1:25:43] i have god in my heart i believe him
[1:25:47] with all my heart
[1:25:49] do you believe in divine healing with
[1:25:52] all my heart let your testimony always
[1:25:57] and your thoughts and everything never
[1:26:00] permit a negative thought to come in
[1:26:03] your mind
[1:26:05] if
[1:26:06] you can help it
[1:26:11] why
[1:26:12] because you're going to be what you
[1:26:14] confess
[1:26:16] you understand your confession is your
[1:26:19] first move to perfection
[1:26:23] it's your confession that's going to
[1:26:24] make you ready can you imagine always
[1:26:27] going on i'm not a very good christian
[1:26:28] i'm not saved i'm not that i'm not that
[1:26:32] well i'm real guilty of that
[1:26:35] i do it all the time you know i'm not
[1:26:37] very good preacher i don't can't do it
[1:26:38] i'm not very smart and i forget that
[1:26:40] stuff i say what the prophet says that
[1:26:42] makes me one of the greatest preachers
[1:26:44] on earth
[1:26:47] i don't have to be the greatest preacher
[1:26:50] you understand but i know that when i
[1:26:53] meet the throne i'll meet my judgments
[1:26:56] but i am not going to be condemned for
[1:26:58] what i said
[1:27:00] or what i shared let's put it that way
[1:27:03] i'm going to say what he says and share
[1:27:05] that he said never permit a negative
[1:27:08] thought to come in your mind if you can
[1:27:10] help it when you start that you don't
[1:27:13] don't entertain it
[1:27:16] well you say i can help
[1:27:18] the thoughts from coming well that's
[1:27:20] like the farmer that said he couldn't
[1:27:23] stop he couldn't stop the birds from
[1:27:25] flying over his place but he sure could
[1:27:28] stop them from roosting
[1:27:34] why
[1:27:35] if they roost
[1:27:37] you're going to confess it
[1:27:40] so that's so that's the a good thing see
[1:27:44] you can help the thoughts when they come
[1:27:48] but don't don't don't entertain them
[1:27:52] just pass it on no sir jesus is my
[1:27:56] savior
[1:27:57] all things are mine by god
[1:28:00] i'm going to keep them i'm going to
[1:28:03] testify of them and god can only bless
[1:28:07] you as you confess
[1:28:10] that he has done it for you see he's the
[1:28:14] high priest of our confession
[1:28:17] is that right
[1:28:18] hebrews 3
[1:28:20] he said that he's the high priest of our
[1:28:23] confession he can only do for us what we
[1:28:27] accept and believe
[1:28:29] and
[1:28:31] confess
[1:28:34] your confession
[1:28:36] is what's making you ready
[1:28:38] i'm a member of the bride
[1:28:42] i believe the end time message of the
[1:28:44] hour i believe there's deliverance i
[1:28:47] believe there's healing i believe
[1:28:49] there's overcoming power
[1:28:51] lord i don't like this habit i have i
[1:28:54] believe you're gonna deliver me i don't
[1:28:56] like the weakness of my flesh but i
[1:28:59] believe that through your strength i
[1:29:01] made perfect i can do all things through
[1:29:04] christ jesus who saved me
[1:29:07] not by my spirit lord not by my strength
[1:29:10] lord but by your spirit
[1:29:15] now you're confessing
[1:29:17] and by your confessing your the
[1:29:20] simplicity of speaking the word you have
[1:29:23] actually spoke the word
[1:29:28] concerning yourself
[1:29:30] and what you're going to be
[1:29:32] and what you're going to become
[1:29:36] if you confess where you are
[1:29:39] or confess where you've been
[1:29:41] you're not moving forward
[1:29:43] but your confession is what makes you
[1:29:46] ready
[1:29:47] and and you're made ready by your
[1:29:50] confession because you'll see
[1:29:52] your confession
[1:29:54] manifested
[1:29:57] this is
[1:29:59] in proving his word paragraph
[1:30:02] 2 15. the bible said that jesus is the
[1:30:05] same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:09] he says he's a high priest
[1:30:12] sitting there making intercession
[1:30:16] upon our confession
[1:30:23] we have to confess it first
[1:30:26] before he can be a high priest
[1:30:30] because he only intercedes to our
[1:30:33] confessions
[1:30:36] what's the high priest remember
[1:30:39] he went in
[1:30:41] all the people would lay their hands on
[1:30:43] the calf they would all confess their
[1:30:46] sins and then they would bring that calf
[1:30:48] and they'd slaughter that calf and
[1:30:50] they'd offer that calf up
[1:30:52] so then that's what the high priest did
[1:30:56] he went and made the intercession
[1:31:00] based on what the people confessed
[1:31:03] and what they were looking for god
[1:31:05] that's what he went in to represent
[1:31:08] now someone that didn't confess someone
[1:31:10] that didn't lay their hands on the
[1:31:12] calves someone that didn't make the
[1:31:14] offering he couldn't make no
[1:31:15] intercession for that
[1:31:18] and it's the same
[1:31:22] he can't change the way he does things
[1:31:27] he's not going to intercede
[1:31:31] on anything you don't confess
[1:31:34] because he wants to identify himself
[1:31:38] with you
[1:31:39] he wants to be identified with your
[1:31:41] confession so when you the simplicity of
[1:31:44] speaking the word you speak the promise
[1:31:48] you confess the promise
[1:31:52] now he's got something he can identify
[1:31:54] with
[1:31:56] he becomes the interceder
[1:31:59] he carries out and manifests your
[1:32:02] confession and then you have the
[1:32:04] manifestation
[1:32:06] of your
[1:32:07] confession
[1:32:10] you people are looking for
[1:32:12] manifestations without confession
[1:32:16] but it's the simplicity
[1:32:19] of speaking the word
[1:32:22] he says he's the sitting there make
[1:32:24] intercession upon your confession
[1:32:27] we have to confess it first
[1:32:30] because he only intercedes on your
[1:32:32] confession is that right
[1:32:34] minister brothers
[1:32:36] he only intercedes upon our confession
[1:32:39] what we confess that he is
[1:32:44] what he has done for us
[1:32:47] not what he will do
[1:32:49] he has already
[1:32:52] done it
[1:32:56] that's what you're confessing
[1:32:59] that's why it becomes the manifestation
[1:33:02] of your confession we have to confess
[1:33:05] that he's done it he was wounded for our
[1:33:08] transgression
[1:33:10] by his stripes
[1:33:12] we were
[1:33:14] healed
[1:33:16] remember sis when the lord come down
[1:33:18] that's the only thing he said by his
[1:33:20] stripes i'm healed just
[1:33:22] keep
[1:33:23] testifying to it
[1:33:25] that's the truth do you feel it no
[1:33:31] does it look like it
[1:33:33] no
[1:33:35] but what are you testifying too i'm
[1:33:37] testifying to the unseen
[1:33:40] i'm testifying that faith is the
[1:33:43] evidence of what that i'm hoping for and
[1:33:45] i haven't seen because he's the high
[1:33:48] priest that's going to work upon my
[1:33:51] intercessions
[1:33:59] he says
[1:34:00] and he's sitting at the right hand of
[1:34:03] the father
[1:34:05] making intercession
[1:34:07] upon his death burial and resurrection
[1:34:11] hallelujah
[1:34:12] there he is even now lord
[1:34:15] whatsoever ye ask the father
[1:34:19] god will do it
[1:34:21] for there he sets his majesty sitting
[1:34:25] by the side of the father
[1:34:28] at the right hand of him upon their
[1:34:30] making intercession
[1:34:32] upon anything that you'll ask him and
[1:34:36] confess that he's done it
[1:34:40] he'll confess it before the father
[1:34:44] how many know that's what jesus taught
[1:34:46] over 13 places he makes this statement
[1:34:49] if you'll confess me before men i will
[1:34:53] confess you before the father
[1:34:56] what are you doing when you confess the
[1:34:58] word what are you doing when you confess
[1:35:02] a promise what are you doing when you
[1:35:04] say by his stripes i am healed you're
[1:35:06] testifying of him
[1:35:09] and if you're testifying of him he's
[1:35:12] there to make intercession of the to the
[1:35:15] father on behalf of your confession now
[1:35:19] he becomes the high priest and god
[1:35:21] responds only to what you
[1:35:26] confess
[1:35:28] that is the simplicity
[1:35:33] of speaking the word
[1:35:37] it isn't this great big bride that's
[1:35:39] going to rise up
[1:35:43] you know what i mean and it's going to
[1:35:45] go change things
[1:35:47] because we're not confessing we're
[1:35:49] confessing to what he's already done
[1:35:51] that's what we're testifying to he's
[1:35:54] already sent the messenger
[1:35:58] we're just testifying that there's life
[1:36:01] in the words that he speaks
[1:36:04] there's revelation there's spiritual
[1:36:07] food and disease and there's more there
[1:36:09] to eat
[1:36:12] if you don't think there's any more food
[1:36:14] in the message to eat then you're not
[1:36:15] going to look for food
[1:36:17] you're not going to find food
[1:36:20] if you don't believe there's no more
[1:36:21] revelation for you in there there's
[1:36:24] going to be no more revelation for you
[1:36:30] if you don't believe there's any hope
[1:36:33] then there's no hope
[1:36:37] but when you cry out
[1:36:40] and you confess
[1:36:42] he's faithful
[1:36:44] and just
[1:36:46] to hear your confession
[1:36:52] up there making intercession upon
[1:36:54] anything that you ask him and confess
[1:36:57] he's done
[1:36:58] he'll confess it before the father
[1:37:01] what more do you want
[1:37:08] wow
[1:37:09] think of it
[1:37:10] all i have to do is confess his promise
[1:37:15] believe in my heart
[1:37:17] not hide it back
[1:37:19] not puddle under a bushel basket but
[1:37:21] confess what he's done now he's up there
[1:37:25] talking to the father
[1:37:28] the father of all light
[1:37:33] what more do you want say lord
[1:37:36] i accept you as my healer
[1:37:40] i'll never say nothing else
[1:37:42] but what i'm healed
[1:37:44] from now on
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:47] that settles it he can't do nothing for
[1:37:50] you
[1:37:51] till you first confess it
[1:37:53] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:37:56] in that case not even your faith
[1:38:00] and even couldn't be faith until you
[1:38:03] confess it you've got to accept
[1:38:06] faith
[1:38:07] believe it and confess it that it's
[1:38:11] already done because faith is the
[1:38:13] substance of things hoped for the
[1:38:16] evidence of things
[1:38:18] not
[1:38:19] seen
[1:38:21] amen
[1:38:24] amen and he makes this statement
[1:38:27] whatever you confess that he
[1:38:32] that he
[1:38:33] is to you
[1:38:36] that's what he confesses
[1:38:38] before
[1:38:39] the father
[1:38:41] from whence he shall come
[1:38:44] in his power
[1:38:47] so
[1:38:48] we trust that that's a foundation what
[1:38:51] time is it
[1:38:54] nobody knows what's great
[1:38:56] hallelujah acts 10 after 10.
[1:39:02] glory
[1:39:04] because
[1:39:05] i want to play
[1:39:09] 30 minutes
[1:39:11] of a message
[1:39:13] and
[1:39:14] this is like a segue
[1:39:17] or we're going to change gear because we
[1:39:19] talked about your confession
[1:39:22] and we talked about your confession
[1:39:24] making you ready
[1:39:27] and we talked about
[1:39:29] your confession
[1:39:31] being manifested
[1:39:34] these next
[1:39:35] few minutes
[1:39:37] and we'll close right after brother
[1:39:39] brown speaks billy will come up
[1:39:42] and lead songs
[1:39:43] this is
[1:39:45] brother branham explaining to you
[1:39:50] your
[1:39:51] individual
[1:39:52] responsibility
[1:39:54] to make yourself ready
[1:39:59] okay now
[1:40:01] you make yourself ready by your
[1:40:04] confession
[1:40:07] you confess
[1:40:09] you step into it
[1:40:11] you've changed he's made intercession
[1:40:14] you grow and become more spiritual
[1:40:18] more like christ
[1:40:19] by your confession
[1:40:21] now you've got a responsibility
[1:40:24] individually today
[1:40:26] to make yourself ready is everybody good
[1:40:29] for just 30 minutes
[1:40:31] 30 more minutes so there's more years
[1:40:32] than nays
[1:40:34] the nays can leave
[1:40:37] because we want a house full of faith
[1:40:39] don't we
[1:40:40] amen you can get up and stretch
[1:40:42] you can do these things with church i'm
[1:40:44] talking about hidden secrets
[1:40:48] hidden secrets that the prophets laid
[1:40:51] down
[1:40:52] we went all the way from 50
[1:40:55] all the way to 65.
[1:41:00] him saying
[1:41:02] the church is made ready by their
[1:41:04] confession
[1:41:05] they change by their confession
[1:41:09] watch what comes out of your mouth
[1:41:14] never
[1:41:15] never
[1:41:17] never make a negative confession
[1:41:24] you're throwing
[1:41:26] poison in the pot
[1:41:29] let's renew our minds by the washing
[1:41:32] of the water of the word so if i this is
[1:41:36] this this morning i want you to take
[1:41:38] this to heart
[1:41:39] what he's saying
[1:41:41] because he's talking about the lay
[1:41:43] member he's talking about the christian
[1:41:46] he's talking about the responsibility
[1:41:48] we're starting on paragraph 92
[1:41:51] of the secret
[1:41:53] uh
[1:41:54] i think it's called the secret
[1:41:57] the sudden
[1:41:58] secret going away
[1:42:01] of the church
[1:42:03] god bless you this morning
[1:42:05] i hope it's not too late for you lord
[1:42:08] richard bless you steve so good to see
[1:42:09] you my brother god bless you god's going
[1:42:11] to fix that
[1:42:13] that's the word of the lord
[1:42:15] thank you
[1:42:18] oh what we need today is a calling
[1:42:21] together
[1:42:22] of getting ready
[1:42:24] i'm not depending on the preacher
[1:42:27] but you as an individual before god make
[1:42:31] yourself ready for the coming of the
[1:42:34] lord
[1:42:35] to escape all this corruption amen
[1:42:39] no matter what they call you and what
[1:42:41] action they take that doesn't change god
[1:42:44] one bit god will do it just the same
[1:42:47] he's defending and waiting on us
[1:42:51] oh my
[1:42:53] some people say well i go to church on
[1:42:56] sunday morning i listen to our pastor
[1:42:58] which is a fine preacher that's good i
[1:43:01] appreciate that then you
[1:43:05] are the america the world whoever it is
[1:43:08] but it takes more than a good message
[1:43:10] from the pulpit
[1:43:12] it takes your life
[1:43:15] it takes you to get ready
[1:43:19] in revelations the 19th chapter and the
[1:43:22] seventh verse
[1:43:23] the bible said that speaking of the
[1:43:26] bride of christ she has made herself
[1:43:30] ready
[1:43:33] she made herself ready
[1:43:36] and you as a member of this bride you've
[1:43:40] got to make yourself ready
[1:43:45] some time ago
[1:43:46] a minister
[1:43:48] was preaching in
[1:43:50] and there was a man who had been
[1:43:51] attending his church for
[1:43:53] oh quite a lengthy time and he came that
[1:43:56] morning up to the altar and he said
[1:43:58] pastor i now wish to give my
[1:44:02] a testimony and my
[1:44:04] surrender to the lord jesus which i have
[1:44:07] done last night
[1:44:10] and the pastor said well
[1:44:12] uh i am sure glad
[1:44:15] to hear about that john
[1:44:18] to know that you have decided to
[1:44:20] finally come and give yourself to the
[1:44:22] lord because
[1:44:24] we don't want to hurt your feelings but
[1:44:25] we know that you have been very wicked
[1:44:29] and we know you have mistreated your
[1:44:31] family
[1:44:32] you've gambled away your money and you
[1:44:34] drank it up and
[1:44:36] live a horrible life and your family
[1:44:38] went without
[1:44:40] and it gives my heart joy this morning
[1:44:43] to know that you have come forward now
[1:44:46] and going to surrender yourself to the
[1:44:48] lord jesus to become a different person
[1:44:51] to serve him
[1:44:53] he said thank you pastor
[1:44:56] he said then just what uh
[1:44:59] i want to ask you something
[1:45:01] what sermon did i preach
[1:45:05] or what
[1:45:07] text did i use
[1:45:10] these are what song was sung in the
[1:45:13] church in the hymns
[1:45:15] that made you so decide to do this
[1:45:19] and as the man looked at him in the face
[1:45:21] with the tears running off his cheeks he
[1:45:25] said pastor it was none of your sermons
[1:45:28] though as good as they were
[1:45:30] it was none of the choirs singing are
[1:45:33] the specials though as good as they were
[1:45:38] he said then would you tell this
[1:45:39] congregation why you have made this
[1:45:41] decision
[1:45:42] he said i work with a man
[1:45:45] who is a christian
[1:45:47] and i've said everything to him
[1:45:50] i've called him a holy roller i've
[1:45:53] called him a religious fanatic and
[1:45:55] everything and it doesn't bother him a
[1:45:57] bit
[1:45:58] but he lives such our life
[1:46:01] till finally in my heart all along
[1:46:04] he has what a place that i want to be
[1:46:06] like that man and that's the reason i
[1:46:09] asked him to lead me to christ i wanted
[1:46:11] the christ that he serves
[1:46:15] you see
[1:46:17] god does work through the pastor to get
[1:46:19] his church ready
[1:46:21] he works through the songs to get his
[1:46:23] church ready
[1:46:24] and he works through you
[1:46:27] to get his church ready
[1:46:30] if your pastor would fail
[1:46:32] and continually to fail
[1:46:35] you'd hunt you another pastor
[1:46:38] quickly you would do that if your choir
[1:46:40] didn't sing right or your souls wasn't
[1:46:42] right you would say to the director the
[1:46:44] one who has the music don't let them
[1:46:47] sing them or they just make me nervous
[1:46:49] to sing
[1:46:51] but what about you as an individual how
[1:46:54] do you fail in your daily living
[1:46:56] how do you tally up with god what god
[1:46:59] says for you to be a shining light that
[1:47:01] sets on a hill
[1:47:03] no one can pass that way around your way
[1:47:06] without knowing about jesus
[1:47:08] what type of life do you live one of
[1:47:10] those types of
[1:47:12] mean and souling and aggravating and
[1:47:14] different or can you speak of the peace
[1:47:18] and the love that you have found in
[1:47:20] christ
[1:47:22] she has made herself ready
[1:47:25] i was showing you the wickedness and the
[1:47:28] time would not would fail me to go
[1:47:30] through the ages and show that each time
[1:47:32] i can babble on the night of the rioting
[1:47:35] and dancing and drinking and so forth
[1:47:37] and what happened and down to the age
[1:47:40] has been that way in every age god's had
[1:47:43] thunderbolt prophets
[1:47:46] and signs and wonders
[1:47:48] to condemn the thing in the midst of all
[1:47:51] popularity and stand alone for god
[1:47:55] not only that but what if i would speak
[1:47:57] of the time of little stevens not a
[1:47:59] prophet
[1:48:01] not a pastor
[1:48:04] the member of the body of christ
[1:48:08] how that this little fellow stood before
[1:48:11] the sanhedrin council that morning
[1:48:14] and spoke out to those who were
[1:48:16] condemning him and said
[1:48:18] you
[1:48:20] stiff necks
[1:48:21] uncircumcised in the heart and ears
[1:48:24] you do always resist the holy ghost as
[1:48:26] your fathers did so do you
[1:48:30] he wasn't a pastor
[1:48:32] you can't expect your pastor to do it
[1:48:34] all
[1:48:35] you can't expect your trusty board to do
[1:48:37] it all or your deacon bored
[1:48:39] you've got to make yourself ready
[1:48:43] it's an individual affair and remember
[1:48:46] his coming is so sudden that the church
[1:48:49] will go in the twinkling of an eye
[1:48:53] and if we see sin on every hand and
[1:48:55] judgment pending in the battleships of
[1:48:58] god's wrath coming how we escape this
[1:49:04] signs are appearing
[1:49:06] jesus is coming
[1:49:09] and great wonders are being done every
[1:49:12] mild post is pouring towards his
[1:49:15] soon appearing and it will happen in a
[1:49:17] moment
[1:49:20] how are we standing this morning as we
[1:49:21] take inventory
[1:49:24] if we should be spoke to this morning
[1:49:27] and the lord jesus should descend from
[1:49:29] the heavens this morning with the shout
[1:49:32] and the trump of god
[1:49:34] would we be found ready
[1:49:37] as a church body amen would we be found
[1:49:40] ready as an individual to join with
[1:49:42] those who are raised from the dead who
[1:49:44] have proven themselves ready
[1:49:47] no matter whether we are ready or not
[1:49:49] the lord jesus will come just the same
[1:49:51] at the appointed time
[1:49:53] we must be ready
[1:49:55] and we must do it now
[1:49:59] it is no time to wait
[1:50:02] we must redeem the time
[1:50:05] and be ready
[1:50:07] some time ago a story just before
[1:50:10] closing
[1:50:11] that struck me as i heard it many many
[1:50:14] years ago
[1:50:16] this secret
[1:50:19] coming of the lord
[1:50:23] secret
[1:50:24] going of the church
[1:50:26] watch there'll be two in the field
[1:50:29] i'll take one and leave one
[1:50:33] there'll be two in the bed
[1:50:36] i'll take one and leave one showing that
[1:50:40] the coming of the lord will not be just
[1:50:43] at any certain corner
[1:50:45] but it'll be universal one will be in
[1:50:47] the field working daytime the other in
[1:50:49] the bed sleeping on the other side of
[1:50:50] the world
[1:50:52] it'll be a universal rapture
[1:50:56] and it will come with the shout with the
[1:50:58] voice of the archangel and the trump of
[1:51:01] god shall sound in the dead christ shall
[1:51:04] rise
[1:51:05] and shall be caught away secretly
[1:51:09] oh i love that
[1:51:12] the great bridegroom coming into bride
[1:51:14] got herself ready waiting for that
[1:51:16] secret moment
[1:51:18] that she doesn't even know herself
[1:51:21] but she's ready and dressed and waiting
[1:51:23] for it
[1:51:25] we see signpost in the world that she's
[1:51:27] ready for judgment
[1:51:29] we see signs and wonders in the church
[1:51:31] great things taking place
[1:51:33] what kind of people should we be

[1:51:44] minute or hour your lord does come
[1:51:48] be ready
[1:51:50] for you can't get ready then
[1:51:52] for he said you could not
[1:51:55] how many of you all perhaps have read of
[1:51:58] the virgins some were wise and some were
[1:52:01] foolish
[1:52:03] virgin means purity they were all good
[1:52:05] people
[1:52:06] every one of them virgin sanctified
[1:52:08] vessels of god

[1:52:12] went in
[1:52:14] and the others was left out they were
[1:52:16] all virgins every one people that you
[1:52:19] couldn't put your finger on for anything
[1:52:21] wrong they everyone believed in the
[1:52:23] coming of the lord they were ready to go
[1:52:26] meet him but some of them let their oil
[1:52:29] go out
[1:52:31] don't let that be your case
[1:52:35] keep oil in your land
[1:52:37] oil is the spirit the holy spirit
[1:52:40] never let it drain from you
[1:52:43] when you feel your love dying away your
[1:52:46] sincerity to christ into the cause
[1:52:49] quickly go to him who has the fountain
[1:52:53] of oil
[1:52:54] and by for yourself
[1:52:57] a filling of the holy spirit
[1:53:00] our nation gone
[1:53:03] morally corrupted and ruined
[1:53:07] our politics
[1:53:09] corrupted and gone
[1:53:14] our leaders
[1:53:16] oh
[1:53:17] god
[1:53:18] what could we do about you put a good
[1:53:21] man in and he comes out of
[1:53:24] crook there's only one we can bring now
[1:53:27] that's the lord jesus
[1:53:29] amen let's make ready for his coming
[1:53:32] amen
[1:53:34] i want to tell you a little story that
[1:53:36] i heard some years ago
[1:53:38] in the close
[1:53:40] this sudden
[1:53:42] quick rapture of the church

[1:53:46] place then i'll make ready make ready
[1:53:48] now
[1:53:50] i've just related to you of pearl harbor
[1:53:52] and in many places where they refused to
[1:53:55] hear the warning
[1:53:57] they refused to listen to it
[1:54:00] nothing was left but divine judgment
[1:54:03] upon the people
[1:54:04] now all that will not go in christ will
[1:54:07] be under god's wrath and divine judgment
[1:54:10] please don't let that happen to you
[1:54:12] no matter what the brandon tabernacle
[1:54:14] ever turns out to be
[1:54:16] don't you let it be you
[1:54:19] you be a servant of christ no matter
[1:54:22] what the church world does you be a
[1:54:24] servant of christ it's not up to the
[1:54:26] branham tabernacle neither is it up to
[1:54:29] any other church it's up to you as an
[1:54:31] individual to be ready at the coming of
[1:54:35] the lord
[1:54:37] you must be ready
[1:54:39] i must be ready
[1:54:42] i sweep my own steps it's up to you to
[1:54:44] sweep your steps
[1:54:46] leave mine alone
[1:54:47] me leave yours alone
[1:54:50] you've got to make your garment ready
[1:54:54] that was a great rancher
[1:54:58] and he owned a
[1:54:59] mammoth big ranch
[1:55:02] way in the northern part of colorado
[1:55:04] near the mountain section
[1:55:08] as you all know i done a little ranching
[1:55:10] in my life of riding and so forth
[1:55:14] one of my calls to god was sitting on a
[1:55:17] stair of old texas wheel spurs
[1:55:22] with a rifle laying on the saddle and a
[1:55:24] pistol on my side when i heard down the
[1:55:26] trees boy
[1:55:28] sound like a boy said adam where are you
[1:55:32] when i looked up towards the stars and
[1:55:34] hearing old slim an old cowboy from over
[1:55:37] texas blowing through a comb with a
[1:55:39] piece of paper
[1:55:41] down at the cross where my savior died
[1:55:45] it was down there for cleansing from sin
[1:55:49] i cried
[1:55:51] there to my heart was his blood applied
[1:55:54] glory to his name
[1:55:57] i pull the blanket over my face and
[1:55:59] tried to hide myself
[1:56:01] cause god was looking down in those
[1:56:03] hills
[1:56:05] it's on one of those ranches
[1:56:07] where the great packing companies buy
[1:56:09] their cattle
[1:56:11] run them into the mountains and then
[1:56:13] bring them out at their calves they're
[1:56:14] born in the fall of the year and brandon
[1:56:17] and set off some of the old herd and the
[1:56:18] steers and so forth and go ahead into
[1:56:21] the
[1:56:22] accumulate their
[1:56:24] great uh herds of cattle
[1:56:27] and on this certain ranch
[1:56:30] the owner are the caretaker
[1:56:33] what we call there the top the foreman
[1:56:37] he had about five daughters
[1:56:40] they were all beautiful women
[1:56:43] young single
[1:56:45] and there was a little lady there
[1:56:48] which was a cousin to these girls that
[1:56:51] her father and mother had both deceased
[1:56:55] and she was brought over there to be uh
[1:56:58] to live with her her uncle
[1:57:01] and those girls they wasn't those fancy
[1:57:04] type of frilly fractional and and um
[1:57:08] and they just took this poor little girl
[1:57:10] and they just treated her like she was
[1:57:13] some animal
[1:57:14] all the hard work poured right on her
[1:57:17] she washed the dishes she cleaned up she
[1:57:20] fixed the bunk she she had to do it all
[1:57:22] and they just stayed around with
[1:57:23] polished fingernails and manicure the
[1:57:26] stuff on their lips and all fixed up you
[1:57:29] know just
[1:57:30] pressing
[1:57:31] and especially did they do this when
[1:57:33] they heard that from chicago
[1:57:37] the big packing company
[1:57:40] who owned the outfit
[1:57:43] his young single son was coming to visit
[1:57:46] the ranch
[1:57:48] how did they dike out in good clothes
[1:57:53] and did they dress and make ready
[1:57:56] for his coming
[1:57:58] and each night the conversation be they
[1:58:01] were going to ban this young
[1:58:04] man and marry him who would then they
[1:58:08] would own the ranch themselves
[1:58:10] for the sun would fall air to all
[1:58:15] so they made themselves ready
[1:58:18] so you see there is a ready to be you
[1:58:21] make yourself ready by joining church or
[1:58:23] something that ain't all that's required
[1:58:26] you got to have oil in your land amen
[1:58:31] just your dressing saying we'll build a
[1:58:33] big church we'll belong to a better
[1:58:35] denomination we'll we'll get on a pipe
[1:58:38] organ to the lord we'll make plush seats
[1:58:40] that is what god requires
[1:58:44] righteousness is what god requires in
[1:58:46] his son christ jesus
[1:58:50] that's the garments for the bible said
[1:58:54] the white clothes which he is adorned in
[1:58:56] is the righteousness of the saints amen
[1:59:00] so she these girls thought they would
[1:59:03] make themselves ready for the coming of
[1:59:04] this young man
[1:59:06] of course that poor little cousin that
[1:59:08] reminds me of an office cast somewhere
[1:59:11] you can appreciate her
[1:59:13] she was a beautiful woman but oh my
[1:59:17] she was a nice little girl but she was
[1:59:19] not even considered among them not as a
[1:59:22] relative
[1:59:23] now that's about the true picture of the
[1:59:26] real church today before the
[1:59:27] denominations
[1:59:31] not even considered
[1:59:34] a bunch of
[1:59:35] inner denominations a bunch of outcasts
[1:59:39] so the poor little fellow just went
[1:59:41] ahead working and when the young man
[1:59:44] arrived they didn't know it
[1:59:47] but he come looking for a wife
[1:59:51] he was sick and tired
[1:59:53] of the city girls who just stayed all
[1:59:56] dolled up and
[1:59:58] oh you know
[2:00:00] hung around the bar rooms and uh
[2:00:02] rolled around in the cadillacs and the
[2:00:04] the different things they they were just
[2:00:06] sick and tired of it he thought i'll go
[2:00:09] out west and haunt me
[2:00:10] a real girl that'll be a real mother to
[2:00:13] my babies and somebody who'll not hang
[2:00:16] at all the sewing circles and
[2:00:18] and the societies and things but it'll
[2:00:19] just be a real mother
[2:00:23] what did he find when he got there but
[2:00:25] the same thing
[2:00:27] that he had condemned
[2:00:29] in chicago
[2:00:31] i wonder if the lord jesus will find a
[2:00:33] church just a denomination
[2:00:36] just by name
[2:00:38] a church the world in the land not ready
[2:00:42] to go
[2:00:43] oh they got fined frocks you got the
[2:00:45] biggest churches the biggest this and
[2:00:48] all these things but god don't want that
[2:00:53] he wants you as an individual
[2:00:56] they may have the best pastors they may
[2:00:58] have the finest deacon boards
[2:01:01] but he wants you with all hell
[2:01:05] he's coming to catch that early ride
[2:01:08] away
[2:01:10] and as he this boy looked upon him he
[2:01:13] was disheartened and that night they
[2:01:15] were having something on the order in
[2:01:17] them days it's been a long ago they
[2:01:19] called the charleston which is just like
[2:01:22] a rock and roll
[2:01:23] and they were going to throw one of
[2:01:25] those big parties many you people
[2:01:27] remember that old charleston dance they
[2:01:29] did back when i was a kid when i was out
[2:01:31] there
[2:01:33] and so they were all had their little
[2:01:35] black and white clothes on you know to
[2:01:37] do the oh it was called charleston's and
[2:01:40] black bottom that's what they were
[2:01:42] calling
[2:01:43] and they had them two-tone clothes and
[2:01:45] they were going to
[2:01:47] do these dances and but this boy was
[2:01:50] sick of that stuff
[2:01:53] he was hunting for a real girl
[2:01:56] so he slipped out other party
[2:01:59] he's watching him he went in to look at
[2:02:01] him so is another son that i know of
[2:02:06] another son will come to your church
[2:02:08] your son of god he'll come there
[2:02:11] he'll look around he'll see your fine
[2:02:12] dress he'll he'll know that you're a
[2:02:14] good member
[2:02:16] but he's looking for something different
[2:02:20] from this irregular trend of church
[2:02:24] so as he looked around after all he's so
[2:02:26] discouraged he walked out the door and
[2:02:28] going back walking in the moonlight
[2:02:30] towards the bunk house
[2:02:32] he heard somebody
[2:02:34] kind of humming
[2:02:35] and he looked around and here went this
[2:02:37] little girl with a great big pad of
[2:02:39] dishwater
[2:02:41] way in the night barefooted to throw the
[2:02:44] dishwater out
[2:02:45] and as soon as he saw her
[2:02:48] something another said that's her
[2:02:52] that's the one
[2:02:55] so he put himself in a way and when she
[2:02:57] that's when she come back along the
[2:02:58] crowd fence well he was standing there
[2:03:01] and she almost fainted
[2:03:05] he said how do you do
[2:03:08] and he said what's your name
[2:03:11] and she told him her name and it was the
[2:03:14] same name of the boss of the ranch
[2:03:19] said then i can't understand
[2:03:22] how that this is that your father
[2:03:25] said no
[2:03:27] i'm just the cousin you see
[2:03:30] my father
[2:03:32] and he were brothers
[2:03:34] i've got the same name
[2:03:38] but i
[2:03:39] uh that's the voice
[2:03:46] you might have the name of church
[2:03:48] might have the name of bran tabernacle
[2:03:50] or methodist or whatever church you go
[2:03:52] that isn't it friend
[2:03:54] see it's something different it's your
[2:03:56] character
[2:03:58] that's what god's looking at
[2:04:00] you might be methodist you might be
[2:04:01] baptist you might be presbyterian it's
[2:04:04] not that
[2:04:06] it's character that god looks at
[2:04:09] not just earthly character but holy
[2:04:11] spirit character
[2:04:16] these signs shall follow them that
[2:04:18] believe
[2:04:19] said jesus in the 16th chapter of saint
[2:04:22] mark
[2:04:23] she was so
[2:04:24] gotten that that he would speak to her
[2:04:27] even
[2:04:28] and she held her little head down
[2:04:30] and she ran into the house
[2:04:33] he was there for a week or two
[2:04:36] and he looked all around everywhere
[2:04:39] and he never said no more but he kept
[2:04:41] watching her
[2:04:42] and the night before he left he used to
[2:04:44] leave the next morning that storm
[2:04:46] another big party
[2:04:47] and he watched for her he couldn't find
[2:04:49] her he knows she'd had to do the dishes
[2:04:51] and so forth so the dirty work and all
[2:04:54] could be thrown off
[2:04:56] that's the way the real church of god
[2:04:58] has to take it sometimes the dirty work
[2:05:02] all the scandal names of all of the
[2:05:06] things that need to be thrown at it
[2:05:10] she's a great speckled bird
[2:05:13] all the other birds gather around and
[2:05:15] flock at her
[2:05:16] that's all right her name's on the
[2:05:18] lamb's book of life
[2:05:20] she'll spread her great wings someday
[2:05:22] for a flight she's ready
[2:05:24] and speckles meant the blood of christ
[2:05:26] sprinkled on her
[2:05:29] you've read it in your book the bible
[2:05:33] and this boy caught the little lady that
[2:05:35] night coming out
[2:05:38] he said i've watched you
[2:05:41] no one knows it by myself
[2:05:44] he said i've come out here looking for a
[2:05:46] wife
[2:05:48] and all that i have ever seen you meet
[2:05:52] the requirement
[2:05:54] how did she feel
[2:05:57] the big man's son
[2:06:00] asking her now
[2:06:02] if she would be his wife
[2:06:07] just imagine
[2:06:09] how those girls must have felt
[2:06:12] when they looked out the window
[2:06:14] and saw holding hands with that little
[2:06:17] despised cousin
[2:06:21] the man if they tried to vape with all
[2:06:23] their big
[2:06:24] fine flocks and frills and carrying on
[2:06:29] and he said will you marry me
[2:06:32] oh she said sir i'm not worthy
[2:06:36] that's the way the real church feels
[2:06:38] about it
[2:06:40] i'm not worthy i can if i can just wash
[2:06:43] your dishes it'll be all right
[2:06:47] are you willing to take that place
[2:06:51] could you wash the dishes from the
[2:06:54] supper would you be willing to be called
[2:06:56] fanatic or would you be willing to be
[2:06:59] taken away with the lord's dispatch you
[2:07:02] are you willing
[2:07:03] are you willing at your work to be
[2:07:05] marked
[2:07:08] there's a man he's a religious fanatic
[2:07:10] because he won't drink he won't smoke he
[2:07:13] doesn't dance he doesn't run with women
[2:07:15] there's a woman that keeps her head down
[2:07:17] she walks like down to the town she's
[2:07:20] not she won't join our circles
[2:07:22] are you willing to take the way
[2:07:25] make yourself ready for the coming of
[2:07:27] the lord
[2:07:28] if you have if you do you'll be waiting
[2:07:31] for him to come you'll joy at his coming
[2:07:34] it won't be a dreadful thing it'll be
[2:07:36] the most gracious moment that you can
[2:07:38] think of the coming of the lord
[2:07:41] all those that love his appearing
[2:07:45] so when he left he told her he'd be back
[2:07:47] at a certain time
[2:07:49] so when you begin to see there's a
[2:07:51] winner so when you begin to see
[2:07:53] those trees begin to budge on earth
[2:07:57] that mesquite and stuff begin to take on
[2:07:59] new life
[2:08:00] said that i'll be back about spring time
[2:08:05] i understand i couldn't say it was true
[2:08:07] but the girl only got about a dollar and
[2:08:10] 75 cents a week for her labor
[2:08:14] but she saved every penny of it
[2:08:18] why she was getting ready for the
[2:08:21] wedding that was to be
[2:08:24] she was saving her money for her wedding
[2:08:27] gown
[2:08:28] or he said we'll be married
[2:08:31] right here at the ranch
[2:08:33] when i come
[2:08:35] again
[2:08:37] she saved her money all year she was
[2:08:40] happy
[2:08:41] she didn't mind washing the dishes
[2:08:44] she didn't mind ironing the clothes or
[2:08:46] sweeping out the bunk house i want more
[2:08:50] she was engaged
[2:08:53] to the boss of the ranch
[2:08:55] why do we care what the world says a
[2:08:58] real christian
[2:09:00] why do we care if we have to be just
[2:09:02] just despised and rejected
[2:09:07] blessed are the meek for they shall
[2:09:10] inherit the earth
[2:09:12] the boss's sons are coming one day and
[2:09:14] we're going to a wedding
[2:09:16] supper what difference does it make
[2:09:20] to us
[2:09:21] if you love his appearing
[2:09:23] after it was all
[2:09:25] the days passed the little daughters the
[2:09:27] little cousins made fun of her
[2:09:30] danced around her and done everything
[2:09:32] else but said you poor silly kid
[2:09:36] do you not know if he why he was just
[2:09:39] like all other man
[2:09:41] he was just teasing you but the son of
[2:09:44] god doesn't tease
[2:09:48] except a man be born again he will in no
[2:09:51] wise i don't care how good you look how
[2:09:53] much church you belong to what your
[2:09:55] status is in the country you might be a
[2:09:58] politician you might be in the federal
[2:10:01] government you might be in the catholic
[2:10:03] presbyterian any church you want to be
[2:10:06] but it's except the man be born again
[2:10:09] you'll not enter and these signs shall
[2:10:12] follow them that believe
[2:10:14] i'm only quoting his word
[2:10:17] finally
[2:10:19] when the hour come
[2:10:20] she began to see this the buds began to
[2:10:23] come on the trees
[2:10:25] she knew he'd be there at any time
[2:10:29] and he said i'll try to make it
[2:10:32] just it's sundown
[2:10:34] so he can be married and hurry off
[2:10:38] and every evening at sundown when she
[2:10:41] she'd go and get make herself all ready
[2:10:43] get her little wedding garment out and
[2:10:45] wait at the gate
[2:10:46] and these little cousins come and laugh
[2:10:48] at her and make fun of her and said you
[2:10:51] poor silly ignorant child
[2:10:53] now think that the the man who owns is a
[2:10:57] president or other of the company and
[2:11:00] his boy would marry a dishwasher
[2:11:03] he was looking for virtue
[2:11:06] not clothes
[2:11:08] he had enough money to buy all the
[2:11:09] clothes that's necessary god don't care
[2:11:11] how big your fancy things you have he
[2:11:13] owns everything in the world it's all he
[2:11:15] wants virtue
[2:11:18] he wants something that's real
