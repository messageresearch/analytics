[54:05] and i don't even think i i don't even
[54:07] want to contain myself i just
[54:10] uh this message is wonderful it's just
[54:14] wonderful
[54:15] let's turn over to a scripture
[54:18] and
[54:21] it's found in the book of luke
[54:24] and
[54:26] in the
[54:28] 21st
[54:29] chapter
[54:31] and the 20
[54:34] 25th
[54:37] through
[54:38] uh
[54:40] the
[54:41] 28th the verse and
[54:44] there's a little statement that the
[54:46] prophet of god makes that
[54:48] inspired me to find the scripture
[54:50] and then when i found this scripture it
[54:52] inspired me to exactly where we're at
[54:55] but let's just listen to this it's
[54:57] marvelous
[54:59] and there shall be signs in the sun
[55:03] and in the moon
[55:05] and in the stars
[55:07] and upon the earth
[55:10] distress
[55:11] of nations
[55:13] can we say that's true
[55:17] with perplexities
[55:20] the sea
[55:22] and the waves roaring
[55:24] what do we have two hurricanes coming
[55:26] right now
[55:28] you know just look at
[55:29] men's hearts
[55:31] failing them for fear
[55:34] and for looking after
[55:37] those things which are coming
[55:40] on the earth doesn't that sound like
[55:42] this great virus that we've just been
[55:45] going through
[55:46] you know the things that have come upon
[55:48] the earth for the powers of heaven shall
[55:51] be shaken
[55:53] and then shall they see the son of man
[55:56] coming in a cloud
[55:58] with power and great glory
[56:01] and when these things begin to come to
[56:03] pass
[56:04] then look up
[56:07] and lift up your hearts for your
[56:10] redemption
[56:11] draweth nigh
[56:12] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[56:15] word in jesus precious name we pray amen
[56:19] god bless you you may be seated
[56:28] we're going to play just a few minutes
[56:30] but
[56:31] i i don't know
[56:33] whether to go ahead and share this part
[56:35] of it with you
[56:36] and then knowing this part
[56:39] you can we can listen to the rest of it
[56:42] and so that's kind of what's beating on
[56:45] my heart so
[56:46] uh
[56:48] if you if the brothers will put up and
[56:50] we'll go to our message
[56:52] i'd i'd like just to uh
[56:56] turn to this little part
[56:58] here that uh
[57:01] brother brown talks about
[57:04] right here in the very first part we're
[57:06] going to play
[57:07] and i will read this first part to us
[57:10] and then we'll go back
[57:12] and listen to it
[57:14] he says it's the same spirit
[57:17] that raised him up
[57:20] this is 119
[57:23] that quickened the true believer to
[57:26] eternal life
[57:28] so that's the spirit that did it
[57:31] the spirit that saved us
[57:33] was not you
[57:37] coming to the recognition
[57:40] it was his spirit found jew
[57:44] and and so and that's the spirit by
[57:47] which he did it
[57:49] he said
[57:53] now remember potentially now watch as we
[57:56] are getting
[57:57] out of our time but notice
[58:00] the same spirit now
[58:02] romans 8 and 1 let's just read it again
[58:05] romans 8 1
[58:06] and we'll see
[58:08] what that says
[58:10] that's right now not romans i mean
[58:12] romans 8 and 11 i'm sorry romans 8 11
[58:16] but if
[58:18] there's the problem
[58:20] there's the catch but if
[58:24] the spirit of him
[58:27] god the holy spirit
[58:29] that raised jesus from the dead
[58:32] dwell in you
[58:35] now
[58:37] i don't know maybe things are just so
[58:39] simple to me that i get excited about
[58:41] things that everybody else knows
[58:44] you know but that's okay
[58:47] you know
[58:48] uh now
[58:51] there you are
[58:53] if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the
[58:56] bride
[58:58] when
[58:59] when god made his first bridegroom
[59:04] he made the bridegroom first
[59:07] and he was both man and woman
[59:11] in spirit
[59:13] formed in him
[59:15] in the dust of the earth
[59:18] to make him material
[59:21] so adam was both what male and female
[59:25] he was in spirit form
[59:27] and then he was formed in the dust of
[59:29] the earth to make him material
[59:33] now you've got to hold that about the
[59:35] dust of the earth and be made material
[59:38] and notice when he made eve
[59:42] from adam
[59:44] he took not another piece of clay
[59:48] he took from the same piece of clay
[59:52] the same word
[59:54] for adam was a
[59:57] spoken word
[1:00:00] see
[1:00:02] and he took from him
[1:00:04] and then
[1:00:06] he had
[1:00:07] masculine and feminine spirit
[1:00:11] and he took the feminine spirit away
[1:00:15] from adam
[1:00:17] and placed it in eve
[1:00:20] so it's still a part of adam's spirit
[1:00:24] it's adam's flesh
[1:00:26] then it's adam's spirit the dynamics
[1:00:29] that quicken the mechanics's body
[1:00:32] now
[1:00:34] if you you just
[1:00:37] take a second
[1:00:38] and look over at
[1:00:40] corinthians the
[1:00:42] first
[1:00:45] first corinthians
[1:00:47] and
[1:00:48] 15 i believe
[1:00:50] and 46.
[1:01:03] and we we read this before but it i i
[1:01:06] read it now it becomes more to life to
[1:01:08] me than it did before
[1:01:10] if sown a natural body
[1:01:12] it is also raised a spiritual body
[1:01:15] there is a natural body and there is a
[1:01:17] spiritual body
[1:01:19] so it it is written the first adam was
[1:01:22] made a living soul
[1:01:25] the last adam was made a quickening
[1:01:28] spirit
[1:01:29] now
[1:01:30] when you look at eve
[1:01:32] and what is
[1:01:35] what is uh
[1:01:37] uh
[1:01:38] coming here and from what brother braham
[1:01:40] is leading up to
[1:01:42] so he takes adam
[1:01:45] and he takes eve out of adam
[1:01:48] now adam has the spirit
[1:01:52] so he has the light
[1:01:55] so
[1:01:56] the spirit that was in adam
[1:01:59] is the dynamics
[1:02:02] of eve
[1:02:03] that's where he got
[1:02:05] eve got her dynamics was from the spirit
[1:02:09] that was in adam so if he was brought to
[1:02:13] life
[1:02:14] by the spirit that was in adam so that's
[1:02:18] who was
[1:02:19] that's how eve was raised up
[1:02:22] by the spirit because if god ever does
[1:02:24] one thing one way he's got to
[1:02:27] to do it
[1:02:28] the other way so can you talk about that
[1:02:32] where did eve get her dynamics
[1:02:35] he got it from adam so she got her her
[1:02:38] life her dynamics in other words what
[1:02:41] made her
[1:02:43] what she is that's the dynamics of
[1:02:46] something the description of it the the
[1:02:49] abilities and powers and things that
[1:02:52] that it has she got that from adam but
[1:02:55] adam was make just made her a living
[1:02:57] soul
[1:02:58] but this eve
[1:03:01] this bride
[1:03:02] amen she gets her dynamics because this
[1:03:06] adam he's a quickening spirit
[1:03:10] so his spirit comes to life so now you
[1:03:13] begin to see that how that the how he
[1:03:17] did it
[1:03:18] in the beginning
[1:03:19] god never fails everything he did was
[1:03:24] perfect
[1:03:25] okay so you know all of a sudden i say
[1:03:27] because we're gonna go back in to
[1:03:30] talking in romans about this mortal body
[1:03:33] eve's mortal body came to life
[1:03:37] because of the spirit of adam
[1:03:40] she he
[1:03:42] adam's spirit
[1:03:44] was her dynamics
[1:03:47] now what's our dynamics
[1:03:50] his spirit
[1:03:51] if the same spirit
[1:03:53] that dwelt in him
[1:03:56] dwells in you
[1:03:57] and then we can pick this up and then
[1:04:00] we'll go back through this again slowly
[1:04:02] so but when you approach what he's again
[1:04:05] going to be talking about that you've
[1:04:08] got to if you understand that eve didn't
[1:04:12] become what she was by herself
[1:04:17] she couldn't
[1:04:20] amen and and we can't become
[1:04:23] what we even want to be
[1:04:26] by ourselves but when you know it's a
[1:04:29] promise
[1:04:31] it changes things
[1:04:33] and and so i i mean that that just
[1:04:36] thrilled me to no end i guess it didn't
[1:04:37] thrill you as much as through me but i
[1:04:39] ran around the house about five times
[1:04:41] jumped up twice then had lay down take a
[1:04:43] nap because my head was hurting
[1:04:46] but
[1:04:47] i mean that's fabulous
[1:04:50] what a revelation this is
[1:04:53] so you understand here you are
[1:04:57] and that's why you heal you hear abraham
[1:04:59] said we're born of his bone flesh of his
[1:05:01] flesh we were part of him we were part
[1:05:04] of his spirit in the beginning now he's
[1:05:06] got to quicken it
[1:05:08] so how did eve come alive she didn't
[1:05:11] come alive by herself
[1:05:13] he didn't take different clay
[1:05:15] he didn't take a different spirit
[1:05:18] he took his adam's spirit
[1:05:20] and made eve
[1:05:22] she was the dynamics so what's our
[1:05:25] dynamics the same spirit
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:29] raised him up
[1:05:30] is the same spirit that becomes our
[1:05:33] dynamic so we don't have our own
[1:05:36] dynamics
[1:05:37] in other words we don't say i'm i'm
[1:05:40] going to i'm now going to go do these
[1:05:42] works
[1:05:43] you know what i mean i'm going to do
[1:05:45] this and i'm going to do that and i'm
[1:05:47] going to do this and i'm going to do
[1:05:48] that and we're going to go start this
[1:05:51] this program and we're going to start
[1:05:53] this program and we're we're going to
[1:05:55] have a crusade a thousand souls for
[1:05:58] christ you know a soul a night for the
[1:06:01] rest of our life program or or
[1:06:04] whatever program that man does no
[1:06:08] you can't do this
[1:06:12] but it is
[1:06:13] him
[1:06:15] becomes the dynamics
[1:06:17] he's the one that's do does the works
[1:06:20] he's the one that manifests himself
[1:06:23] through you they become one we become
[1:06:26] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh now
[1:06:30] a lot of people don't want want to have
[1:06:32] anything to do with him
[1:06:34] and we will hear him say that
[1:06:37] but there's something in you
[1:06:40] that cries for that
[1:06:42] amen that hungers
[1:06:44] for that dynamics you just don't want to
[1:06:47] believe in your spirit
[1:06:50] you want something to
[1:06:52] dynamically
[1:06:54] manifest
[1:06:55] in your flesh so we're going to pick up
[1:06:58] here at uh uh 11
[1:07:01] uh 111 and just uh start listening again
[1:07:05] and we're only it's only about 15
[1:07:07] minutes
[1:07:08] and and then we'll just fellowship it
[1:07:10] around it a little more
[1:07:13] but but with the first bridegroom if the
[1:07:16] first bridegroom got her dynamics from
[1:07:19] the
[1:07:21] the first groom
[1:07:22] then the second
[1:07:24] adam his bride has to get the dynamics
[1:07:27] elsa it wouldn't be the same
[1:07:30] thing
[1:07:31] and she is him
[1:07:33] just listen as we listen it's it's
[1:07:36] wonderful uh beautiful thing and it's
[1:07:39] going to help us with our our lives and
[1:07:41] all the battles we go through and
[1:07:43] everything so lord bless you as we just
[1:07:46] listen a little further down the message
[1:08:27] only be the manifestation of the
[1:08:30] fulfilling of all the rebels and is he
[1:08:32] being the group
[1:08:35] the bride has to come forth called this
[1:08:38] part of him
[1:08:39] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:08:42] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:08:44] and the others that spoke of the bride
[1:08:47] it can only manifest if it does
[1:08:49] something different from the groom it
[1:08:51] isn't the bride
[1:08:53] because she's flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:08:56] his bone
[1:08:57] life of his life power of his power
[1:09:01] she is him
[1:09:04] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[1:09:07] from his side she had taken his spirit
[1:09:09] to fame in his spirit coming the flesh
[1:09:11] from his side made both mechanics and
[1:09:14] dynamics the wife
[1:09:18] the spirit of him
[1:09:19] and the flesh of him
[1:09:21] had put it together and made mechanics
[1:09:23] and dynamics
[1:09:25] and tell the church or the people all
[1:09:28] these easter bunnies these turtles and
[1:09:30] big churches and pirates will fail and
[1:09:33] pass away
[1:09:34] until that church become both diamonds
[1:09:38] and mechanics
[1:09:39] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:09:42] do the things that he did
[1:09:44] if he hit on 16 cylinders so
[1:09:49] hey
[1:09:50] why is that in john 14 12. he didn't
[1:09:54] believe upon me
[1:09:55] the works that i do shall he you
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:01] amen also give him a charge of my
[1:10:04] dynamics and his mechanics
[1:10:06] that's the world when i'll be able to
[1:10:08] withstand it
[1:10:09] and i'll raise him up again at the last
[1:10:11] day hallelujah
[1:10:14] that's the easter egg
[1:10:17] the time
[1:10:18] and the mechanics
[1:10:20] together
[1:10:21] the mechanics without the dynamics
[1:10:23] no good
[1:10:24] neither is the dynamics without the
[1:10:26] mechanics
[1:10:27] you can scream and shout and jump up
[1:10:29] down all you want to deny this word amen
[1:10:32] amen they won't do any good
[1:10:34] you're just cranking around them the
[1:10:35] pistons have got sparked out of fire but
[1:10:38] no gas need to far back
[1:10:40] it'll only work as they come together
[1:10:45] so one will set steel and the other will
[1:10:47] go up
[1:10:48] that's the only thing there is to it yet
[1:10:50] they both might look like both claim to
[1:10:52] be churches who claim to be bribed but
[1:10:54] one has
[1:10:55] mechanics and dynamics it brings it to
[1:10:59] pass
[1:11:00] but what he said is the truth
[1:11:02] it just won't
[1:11:04] no matter how good the mechanics is
[1:11:06] until the dynamics comes
[1:11:08] when the time enemy comes that bar is
[1:11:10] made to connect with that octane and the
[1:11:12] gasoline
[1:11:14] and when that exposures it causes
[1:11:16] a combustion
[1:11:18] and that combustion moves
[1:11:22] every motion ever moves
[1:11:25] for he is the same
[1:11:27] yesterday
[1:11:28] today and forever
[1:11:30] that's the resurrection
[1:11:32] that's the real power of god
[1:11:34] mechanics with the dynamics
[1:11:37] notice
[1:11:38] it's the spirit that quickens
[1:11:40] it's the it's the spark that fires
[1:11:44] it's not the gas that fires it's a spark
[1:11:46] that fires the gas
[1:11:48] see you can do nothing without me but
[1:11:51] with me you can do all things
[1:11:54] as he is the words the father living
[1:11:56] father sent me so send i you as the
[1:11:58] father has fired me and pushed me into
[1:12:01] everything i do only that which is
[1:12:02] pleasing to god
[1:12:04] now as he sent me so saying it was the
[1:12:06] same mechanics it takes the same
[1:12:08] dynamics to operate it and these signs
[1:12:11] shall follow them that claim to have the
[1:12:13] mechanics
[1:12:14] the dynamics will take its place paul
[1:12:17] said the gospel came to us not in word
[1:12:18] only through gasoline only but through
[1:12:20] spark also to make it move
[1:12:24] it came to us in that manner
[1:12:26] it's the same spirit that raised him up
[1:12:29] that quickened the true believer to
[1:12:32] eternal life
[1:12:33] i remember potentially now watch as we
[1:12:36] are getting out of our time
[1:12:38] notice
[1:12:39] the same spirit now romans 8 1. let's
[1:12:42] just read that again in romans
[1:12:44] 8 1 and we'll see what that says
[1:12:48] all right and not romans i mean 811 i'm
[1:12:51] sorry and romans 8 11.
[1:12:54] but
[1:12:55] if there's a problem
[1:12:58] there's a sketch but if the spirit of
[1:13:01] him
[1:13:02] god the holy spirit
[1:13:04] that raised up jesus from the dead dwelt
[1:13:08] in you
[1:13:11] oh
[1:13:12] there you are
[1:13:14] if the bridegrooms
[1:13:17] spirit dwells in the bride
[1:13:20] when god made his first bride grew
[1:13:24] he made the bridegroom first
[1:13:26] and he was both man and woman in spirit
[1:13:30] forming in the dust of the earth and
[1:13:32] making material
[1:13:33] and notice when he made eat from adam he
[1:13:37] took
[1:13:38] not another piece of clay he took from
[1:13:41] the same piece of clay
[1:13:43] the same word
[1:13:44] or adam was a spoken word
[1:13:47] see he took from him and then taken the
[1:13:50] he had masculine and feminist spirit
[1:13:52] and he took the feminist spirit away
[1:13:55] from adam
[1:13:56] and placed it in eaves who are still
[1:13:58] part of adam's spirit
[1:14:01] is adam's flesh
[1:14:03] then it was adam's spirit the dynamics
[1:14:06] that quickened the mechanics of his body
[1:14:09] so the bride must also be
[1:14:12] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones
[1:14:16] then how is this mortal flesh go become
[1:14:18] his flesh we'll get to it
[1:14:21] how is it done how what is this great
[1:14:23] transformation notice now if the spirit
[1:14:29] of him god
[1:14:31] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:14:33] dwell in you
[1:14:35] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:14:38] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:14:41] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:14:45] oh my
[1:14:48] the predestinated ones
[1:14:50] of course like the seed laid up on the
[1:14:52] earth the one that had life and many of
[1:14:54] them are dead they were just rotten
[1:14:57] seeds
[1:14:58] the waters and things burned them out
[1:15:00] but you know there was a seed laying
[1:15:02] there
[1:15:03] ready for life god know it was laying
[1:15:05] there
[1:15:06] now
[1:15:07] the predestinated ones
[1:15:09] are the first to be quickened by the
[1:15:11] holy spirit for the holy spirit comes
[1:15:14] to claim its own
[1:15:18] how this is deep now
[1:15:20] be sure to catch this good
[1:15:23] now as the sun was set across the earth
[1:15:27] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[1:15:30] to lie
[1:15:31] it was not to bring all the dirt to the
[1:15:34] night
[1:15:35] but was to bring the part of the dirt
[1:15:38] which
[1:15:39] was enclosed around alive
[1:15:43] not all men will receive crime
[1:15:45] oh no
[1:15:47] but those which god
[1:15:49] for ordained
[1:15:51] life
[1:15:53] is housed around some of the dirt of the
[1:15:55] earth
[1:15:56] that's when it comes to quicken they're
[1:15:58] the ones that now that dirt would lay
[1:16:00] there in the sun and say oh this old
[1:16:01] sun's so hot that rock said there's no
[1:16:03] sun so hot
[1:16:05] but that little seed said that's what
[1:16:06] i'm looking for
[1:16:07] and they begin to spring forth the line
[1:16:10] it quickened that part of the dirt
[1:16:13] because the sun was sent
[1:16:17] not to quicken the rock not to quicken
[1:16:21] the earth but to quicken the life
[1:16:24] of the seed
[1:16:27] now the holy spirit comes now
[1:16:30] of course it wasn't set why won't all
[1:16:32] the people receive it it wasn't sent to
[1:16:34] him
[1:16:36] god told me i don't believe i don't care
[1:16:37] what you say if you could raise up the
[1:16:39] dead or anything and heal the sick and
[1:16:40] prove it anyway i still don't believe i
[1:16:41] said sorry not
[1:16:43] you're unbelievers
[1:16:45] it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't
[1:16:46] even sent to you
[1:16:48] it's said to those who will believe
[1:16:50] the message is to the believer
[1:16:53] to them that perish is foolishness
[1:16:56] but to them that are in christ and part
[1:16:58] of that seed is life
[1:17:00] my crude little story about the
[1:17:02] farmer putting the egg uh the eagle egg
[1:17:05] under the heat
[1:17:06] see that little eagle was absolutely he
[1:17:09] was a he was an odd looking little
[1:17:10] creature when this uh farmer had did
[1:17:13] that thing that he did to put this uh
[1:17:15] eagle egg under this old hand
[1:17:17] and she hatched out a funny looking
[1:17:20] chicken
[1:17:21] and it was a
[1:17:22] odd little solid he didn't look like him
[1:17:23] his feathers wasn't like the rest of him
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:25] he just he was an odd little guy
[1:17:28] and all rested chickens recognized him
[1:17:30] in odd fella
[1:17:32] and
[1:17:33] the hen went around he didn't even like
[1:17:35] the dikes she was feeding me
[1:17:36] he just didn't like that scratching in
[1:17:38] the barnyard he he didn't have nothing
[1:17:39] to do with it
[1:17:41] so he wondered why he had to be the odd
[1:17:42] one around there any
[1:17:44] thing and he never tasted anything that
[1:17:47] he just eat enough to keep him alive
[1:17:49] because he didn't like the taste of it
[1:17:51] see because he was a chicken too
[1:17:55] and uh the hen would cluck and you know
[1:17:59] jay's a miracle just past there is no
[1:18:00] such a thing he joined the church
[1:18:03] it just didn't hit right with the little
[1:18:05] guy
[1:18:06] so he fought around the hands
[1:18:08] until one day
[1:18:11] his mammy
[1:18:12] the old eagle old laid so many eggs
[1:18:17] and there was one missing
[1:18:21] she knew that that eagle was somewhere
[1:18:25] so she starts out on the hunt for him
[1:18:28] and she's circled over the mountain tops
[1:18:30] and down in the valleys over and
[1:18:32] everywhere where he might
[1:18:35] be by this time
[1:18:36] it's time for him to be born
[1:18:38] the time frame be hatched out
[1:18:41] so maybe a crow come in and picked up my
[1:18:43] egg
[1:18:45] maybe a vulture
[1:18:47] i don't know if something picked up my
[1:18:48] egg
[1:18:49] but i know that egg is in my mind
[1:18:56] i got a son somewhere
[1:19:00] i got the honey
[1:19:03] oh god
[1:19:05] he's that great eagle
[1:19:06] and his thoughts he wanted to have a
[1:19:08] church
[1:19:09] in order to have a people
[1:19:11] no matter what's cuddled him no matter
[1:19:13] what he's hatched out under
[1:19:15] he's hunting
[1:19:18] he's hunting for his own
[1:19:20] and one day the story goes
[1:19:22] this old eagle flew over the barnyard
[1:19:26] she's looking everywhere and she found
[1:19:27] him
[1:19:29] oh
[1:19:29] for that resurrection
[1:19:31] to recognize that he really wasn't
[1:19:33] chicken natural
[1:19:35] was an eagle
[1:19:38] and he's always taught to look down
[1:19:41] look for a bug or something in the
[1:19:42] barnyard
[1:19:44] but he heard a scream and said look up
[1:19:46] this way
[1:19:48] and he looked above him and there was a
[1:19:51] creature
[1:19:52] with 14 feet wings
[1:19:56] powerful in all the chickens he was in a
[1:19:57] barn heart
[1:20:00] and claimed him to be her son
[1:20:04] is that mama how can it get to you so
[1:20:06] just jump start flopping your hands or
[1:20:08] you're an eagle
[1:20:09] see
[1:20:10] she knew she had a son somewhere
[1:20:15] no matter what he's been raised up in
[1:20:18] she's got a son somewhere
[1:20:20] god knows
[1:20:22] hallelujah he's got a predestinated
[1:20:25] foreign church
[1:20:28] you know what he's got sons and
[1:20:29] daughters and a bride waiting somewhere
[1:20:32] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[1:20:35] that wave she
[1:20:38] he's the same yesterday forever not some
[1:20:42] mythical story but a reality
[1:20:46] no matter how many tried to tell him an
[1:20:47] eagle he didn't know what an eagle was
[1:20:49] yet he was an eagle
[1:20:51] he would understood it
[1:20:53] until he seen something
[1:20:56] that reflected him
[1:20:58] that he reflected rather
[1:21:01] and when we see not a denomination
[1:21:04] not a phd
[1:21:05] not a llg
[1:21:07] not a good neighbor
[1:21:10] but a son of god
[1:21:13] loaded in the image of god with the
[1:21:15] dynamic power of god to answer the
[1:21:18] request of this day that he's the same
[1:21:20] yesterday today and forever
[1:21:22] there ain't no hen gonna hold you
[1:21:26] hunch for his mama
[1:21:29] he's an eagle to begin with
[1:21:31] he recognizes this real eagle recognizes
[1:21:34] the call of god's word
[1:21:36] why
[1:21:38] he's an eagle
[1:21:39] a eagle to a eagle
[1:21:42] the word before the foundation the word
[1:21:45] to the word
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:48] the word predestinated to the word
[1:21:50] written
[1:21:51] for the hour
[1:21:53] you realize your position he hunts for
[1:21:55] it
[1:21:57] this then this
[1:22:00] earthly body
[1:22:02] is quickened and brought by the
[1:22:04] quickening spirit of god to obedience to
[1:22:07] the word of god
[1:22:09] quickly
[1:22:10] what do you want to know how i could get
[1:22:11] there with her
[1:22:13] he'd been taught he couldn't do that
[1:22:16] you can't get a higher jump
[1:22:18] he's a chicken
[1:22:19] see
[1:22:20] but this eagle said that's not
[1:22:23] well look at the chickens no matter what
[1:22:25] the chickens are your eagles
[1:22:28] just start spreading those
[1:22:30] get a little exercise
[1:22:32] start moving up
[1:22:34] the word to the word
[1:22:36] the works that i do shall you also he
[1:22:39] that believeth in me the works that i do
[1:22:41] shall he also
[1:22:43] because i live he lives also in the
[1:22:46] spirit that raised him from the dead
[1:22:47] dwells in you he quickens your mortal
[1:22:49] body
[1:22:50] see
[1:22:51] what does it do now listen to what you
[1:22:53] know that this easter i want to mean
[1:22:55] more to you than any easter egg
[1:22:57] i want you to see we know what it's done
[1:22:59] for him but i want you to see it not
[1:23:02] well it has done the same for you amen
[1:23:06] what does it do it quickens the mortal
[1:23:08] body
[1:23:09] this mortal body that we live in it
[1:23:11] quickens it in other words brings it to
[1:23:13] life
[1:23:14] now you who once walked along with a
[1:23:15] great big cigar in your mouth and
[1:23:17] everything a bunch of cigarettes and you
[1:23:19] women who once had short hair and
[1:23:20] painted and carried on wore shorts and
[1:23:22] things like that oh it wants something
[1:23:23] to scream
[1:23:24] and you look down here and it was the
[1:23:26] word
[1:23:27] hey it quickened your you said no more
[1:23:29] shorts
[1:23:32] no more liquor for me no more lying no
[1:23:34] more stealing no more see the spirit
[1:23:37] that raised him from the dead
[1:23:39] dwelling in you will also
[1:23:42] bring your mortal bodies
[1:23:45] look at the rest of the earth into
[1:23:47] subjection you see what is it subjection
[1:23:49] of love christ who is christ the word
[1:23:54] not the theology but the word
[1:23:57] then
[1:23:58] you say that these things oh i think
[1:24:00] it's hard for women to wear uh flashes
[1:24:02] when the word says no
[1:24:04] see it quits you do that
[1:24:07] you're drawn to it
[1:24:08] see it's you then it becomes you become
[1:24:11] part of the word it brought your body
[1:24:13] not well you say well now let me tell
[1:24:15] you something my pastor i don't care
[1:24:16] what your pastor said
[1:24:18] what the word says
[1:24:19] if you want to be a chick and go on with
[1:24:21] him but if the pastor speaks different
[1:24:23] from this word then he's not a feeder of
[1:24:25] the eagles
[1:24:27] he's the feeder of the hymns see not of
[1:24:29] the eagles see eagle eats on eagles
[1:24:33] they queen the bible said it's wrong to
[1:24:35] do that demand and so forth and what all
[1:24:37] you do it's wrong say days and miracles
[1:24:38] just pass this bible said he's the same
[1:24:40] yesterday forever
[1:24:41] let's say that's mental telepathy
[1:24:43] there's some kind of mind reading this
[1:24:45] discernment all these divisions and
[1:24:46] anxious nonsense they are chickens
[1:24:49] that's right they don't know what eagle
[1:24:50] food is
[1:24:52] but brother when you hear that scream
[1:24:53] there's something in you you're eager to
[1:24:55] begin with why you are the seed
[1:24:58] that the resurrection of the s o n
[1:25:02] has gone in the wave sheep upon the
[1:25:04] earth to make you recognize that you are
[1:25:06] an eagle
[1:25:08] and not a denominational chicken
[1:25:11] you see it
[1:25:12] ha
[1:25:13] it's the spirit that raised him from the
[1:25:15] dead the word
[1:25:16] the dynamic of the word
[1:25:19] dwells in you
[1:25:21] it also quickens your mortal life now
[1:25:24] how we flesh would be flesh and boiling
[1:25:25] is born because quickly while we're yet
[1:25:27] moral sinners
[1:25:29] mortal ready to die these bodies it
[1:25:32] quickens that body
[1:25:34] what's quick it brings the life
[1:25:36] the spirit that wants like to drink run
[1:25:38] around commit adultery and all these
[1:25:40] it's quickened
[1:25:42] well the things die
[1:25:44] and you're resurrected
[1:25:46] it quickens your mortal body
[1:25:48] therefore your bodies is the temple of
[1:25:52] the dynamics
[1:25:54] because why from the beginning you are
[1:25:57] part of the mechanics
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:02] there's your resurrection
[1:26:03] there's the church and the resurrection
[1:26:05] with you
[1:26:06] these bodies right now are quickened
[1:26:10] see you've heard you believe it changed
[1:26:12] you
[1:26:14] from a denomination to the word
[1:26:16] see the dynamic
[1:26:18] if it comes upon water it
[1:26:34] the dynamics strike that but it strike a
[1:26:37] chicken it won't do no good but when it
[1:26:38] strikes the eagle he moves out
[1:26:41] amen the dynamic with the mechanics
[1:26:45] you know what i mean that is if
[1:26:48] he is
[1:26:49] a true eagle now
[1:26:51] he will understand let me straighten a
[1:26:54] little scripture here for you i think
[1:26:55] we're off of the phone but we are still
[1:26:58] here amen
[1:27:00] uh saint john 5 24. jesus said he
[1:27:05] that heareth my word
[1:27:07] and believe us on him and say he has
[1:27:09] everlasting life
[1:27:10] now look i go down the street just take
[1:27:12] that literally what it is without the
[1:27:14] spiritual understanding i'll make it say
[1:27:15] nothing else but it's saying what it
[1:27:17] says see
[1:27:19] the right word there in the greek in the
[1:27:22] original it says he that understandeth
[1:27:25] my word
[1:27:26] now to prove that's right i go down
[1:27:28] yours there's a drunk coming along the
[1:27:29] street with some other man's wife on his
[1:27:32] arms and cussing and taking god's name
[1:27:34] in vain and everything else like that
[1:27:36] say
[1:27:37] did you like that preacher said did you
[1:27:39] yeah i heard it
[1:27:41] that don't mean he's got eternal life
[1:27:46] that understandeth my word
[1:27:49] he that is an eagle
[1:27:52] now brother brown want more scripture in
[1:27:53] that all right
[1:27:56] my sheep
[1:27:58] hear my voice
[1:28:00] a stranger they won't follow
[1:28:07] didn't that make you so happy
[1:28:09] amen i i'll just share with you what
[1:28:12] this is it's really done something for
[1:28:14] me
[1:28:15] because
[1:28:16] it it just is added
[1:28:19] uh
[1:28:20] just
[1:28:21] so much
[1:28:24] to
[1:28:26] just to understanding
[1:28:28] of the process
[1:28:31] of what
[1:28:32] uh
[1:28:34] takes place and
[1:28:35] and and how
[1:28:37] how beautiful
[1:28:39] uh
[1:28:40] it just all unfolds and and i just
[1:28:44] thought that was
[1:28:45] uh
[1:28:47] something that he talks about here
[1:28:50] uh in
[1:28:51] in paragraph
[1:28:53] 1
[1:28:54] 25
[1:28:56] or just 124 right through there he says
[1:28:58] the predestinated ones of course like
[1:29:00] the seed laying on the earth
[1:29:03] and remember in easter seal how we went
[1:29:06] back and we saw that that seed was in
[1:29:08] the earth that our bodies was in the
[1:29:11] earth
[1:29:12] and
[1:29:13] and so we recognize that so our bodies
[1:29:16] are in the earth and we know that this
[1:29:19] that seed
[1:29:20] is within us
[1:29:22] he says like the seed laying on the
[1:29:24] earth
[1:29:25] it it
[1:29:26] one of that had life in them many of
[1:29:29] them were dead they were just rotten
[1:29:32] seed the water and things burnt them out
[1:29:36] but you know there was a seed lying
[1:29:39] there ready for life god knew it was
[1:29:42] lying there so we know the we talk about
[1:29:45] how he hunts it out
[1:29:47] okay and so i that kind of thrills me
[1:29:50] because of where he found me
[1:29:53] and and each of you have a story of
[1:29:56] where he found you
[1:29:58] that's your testimony if not your people
[1:30:02] mistake they think their testimony is
[1:30:04] what i've done for god oh i prayed for
[1:30:06] the sick i i've i've led thousands to
[1:30:09] christ i've been here i've done that
[1:30:12] i've done this it's not your testimony
[1:30:14] isn't what you've done for god your
[1:30:16] testimony is what god's done for you
[1:30:18] he found me on a rooftop
[1:30:21] in san diego that's where he decided to
[1:30:24] find me i decided to pick that time it
[1:30:26] didn't matter what i come from
[1:30:30] it didn't matter what was cuddling me
[1:30:33] i was being cuddled by a bunch of hell's
[1:30:35] angels by a bunch of drug dealers by a
[1:30:38] bunch of rock musicians
[1:30:41] didn't matter
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:44] because he found me
[1:30:46] amen okay the shepherd goes after the
[1:30:49] sheep
[1:30:50] amen he'll leave the 99 to follow the
[1:30:52] one doesn't that make you feel
[1:30:54] comfortable
[1:30:56] there's there's a rest there
[1:30:58] because you you know we we let where
[1:31:01] we've come from way on us but now we
[1:31:04] begin to see the process of what that he
[1:31:07] quickens first
[1:31:09] he said he says now the predestined ones
[1:31:12] are the first to be quickened by the
[1:31:14] holy spirit for the spirit comes to
[1:31:17] claim its own
[1:31:19] now this is deep now
[1:31:22] and be sure to catch this good
[1:31:26] now when he makes a statement like that
[1:31:29] i stop
[1:31:30] now
[1:31:31] this is eagle food
[1:31:35] you understand i i you know it's a pet
[1:31:38] peeve of mine you know it's my soapbox
[1:31:42] and you know i can't understand how so
[1:31:45] many message people
[1:31:48] never
[1:31:49] play the eagle food
[1:31:51] for their people
[1:31:54] i like to get it straight from the
[1:31:56] chef you know what i mean i don't want
[1:31:59] my seasoning on it you know what i mean
[1:32:03] it's the spoken word is the original
[1:32:06] seed let's have something original
[1:32:09] you know now i might share with you my
[1:32:12] revelation and that's what i'm doing now
[1:32:14] i'm sharing with you
[1:32:16] by testimony
[1:32:18] what this has done for me
[1:32:22] but you've heard it too
[1:32:24] because okay it depends on
[1:32:27] what you are
[1:32:28] and what you heard and what it's doing
[1:32:31] for you
[1:32:32] you've got to jump in there remember
[1:32:34] what he said you've got to hunt it out
[1:32:36] you've got to say what's in here for me
[1:32:39] what's in that eagle hunting it out it
[1:32:41] looked for that mama mama how do i get
[1:32:43] there you've got to go under the word of
[1:32:46] god you've got to open that bible when
[1:32:48] you sit down in your study you when you
[1:32:50] go to pray you've got to seek seek and
[1:32:54] you shall find knock and it shall be
[1:32:56] opened you've got to feast on it you
[1:32:58] can't let no preacher do your religion
[1:33:01] for you you can't let them provide an
[1:33:04] atmosphere that makes you feel good
[1:33:07] prophet of god said you can't make it
[1:33:11] without the sheep offering the eagle
[1:33:14] food
[1:33:15] being waved over you and fed to you
[1:33:19] you'll never come to maturity
[1:33:23] that's just like people they look and
[1:33:25] they see
[1:33:27] they look at god and some see three
[1:33:32] but a real
[1:33:34] seed sees one god
[1:33:38] he only sees one
[1:33:40] it didn't matter how many abraham saw he
[1:33:43] saw lord
[1:33:45] he saw one god he knew the whole picture
[1:33:48] was one god the whole plan was one god
[1:33:53] and and so you know
[1:33:55] it's deep
[1:33:56] so you we gotta you gotta
[1:33:59] understand that this is your hour
[1:34:02] this isn't a time for to pursuing
[1:34:06] careers you've got to have a career i
[1:34:07] believe in going to school i've
[1:34:09] encouraged people to go to school i've
[1:34:12] encouraged people to get degrees that's
[1:34:14] fine be a light there
[1:34:17] there's got to be a light
[1:34:20] but don't put no trust in it
[1:34:23] there's a lot of unemployed
[1:34:26] people with doctorate degrees
[1:34:29] there's a lot of lawyers driving cabs
[1:34:33] no
[1:34:34] but there's a lot of uneducated people
[1:34:37] praised and blessed by the glory of god
[1:34:41] that god's blessed because they put god
[1:34:43] first
[1:34:45] amen put god first amen hallelujah that
[1:34:48] thrills my soul
[1:34:51] my throne soul needs a thrill
[1:34:54] he said this is real deep now the sun
[1:34:57] was sent across the earth not to bring
[1:34:59] rocks
[1:35:01] which was dirt also to life
[1:35:04] but it's not to bring all the dirt to
[1:35:06] life
[1:35:07] but
[1:35:08] was to bring the part of the dirt
[1:35:12] which was enclosed
[1:35:14] around the life now you're the dirt
[1:35:19] this is the dirt
[1:35:21] the seed was in the dirt
[1:35:24] so now he can't just quicken the life
[1:35:27] without quickening the dirt
[1:35:33] because the seed can't manifest it
[1:35:35] manifests itself
[1:35:37] from the dirt
[1:35:40] oh i like this
[1:35:43] she says not all men will receive christ
[1:35:50] you know there's a theory called
[1:35:52] universalism
[1:35:54] that god's so good
[1:35:56] he's just going to save everybody all at
[1:35:58] once one day and everybody's going to be
[1:36:01] saved
[1:36:03] well if that's the case eat drink and be
[1:36:06] merry for tomorrow we shall die i'll go
[1:36:08] rob a bank and and
[1:36:10] live and do all kinds of crazy stuff
[1:36:12] because one day
[1:36:14] no
[1:36:15] no that ain't how it works
[1:36:18] you know how it works he's got a seed
[1:36:21] he hunts them out
[1:36:22] and he quickens them
[1:36:25] in the story all that the father have
[1:36:28] given me will come
[1:36:31] man rejected
[1:36:33] the way god chose to bring them to life
[1:36:36] that's why the scripture says if you
[1:36:39] call this beelzebub there's no more
[1:36:42] repentance for sin because you've
[1:36:44] eliminated the only way that you can be
[1:36:47] brought to life
[1:36:50] religion is people trying to bring
[1:36:53] themselves to life
[1:36:55] trying to put a covering on them we
[1:36:57] don't have to have anything fake
[1:37:01] we actually have the person of the lord
[1:37:04] jesus christ
[1:37:05] on the earth today moving in his word
[1:37:09] finding his children bringing him to
[1:37:12] life and bringing them into a union with
[1:37:15] the word
[1:37:18] what union would they be brought into
[1:37:20] they'd be brought into the union of luke
[1:37:22] 17 30 revelations 10 7. malachi 4 5 they
[1:37:27] would see
[1:37:29] the promised word
[1:37:31] the message the sheaf offering waved
[1:37:34] over and they would know that's the
[1:37:37] ministry that's going to bring me to the
[1:37:40] resurrections
[1:37:45] now that started in your spirit
[1:37:49] right that was in you first
[1:37:54] because that seed was there
[1:37:57] and that seed was quickened
[1:38:00] he said
[1:38:01] he all men won't receive
[1:38:04] christ oh no
[1:38:06] but those which god for ordained to life
[1:38:09] is housed around
[1:38:11] some of the dirt of the earth that's the
[1:38:15] one he comes to quicken they're the ones
[1:38:19] so
[1:38:20] as we look at this
[1:38:22] understand that
[1:38:24] that that spirit moves in you
[1:38:27] okay and you begin to know what's right
[1:38:30] you begin to know what's wrong
[1:38:33] and all of a sudden it places you
[1:38:36] in a war with your flesh
[1:38:41] because your flesh by nature
[1:38:45] is warring against the spirit the spirit
[1:38:48] wars against the flesh and the flesh
[1:38:50] against the spirit and these two are
[1:38:52] contrary to the one everybody uses that
[1:38:55] scripture but they never tell you the
[1:38:57] spirit wins
[1:39:01] that's right
[1:39:02] hallelujah
[1:39:04] i'm not going to war against the spirit
[1:39:09] the spirit's going to bring me into
[1:39:11] subjection to the word it's not going to
[1:39:15] be done by my might it's not going to be
[1:39:17] done by my will but it's going to be
[1:39:19] done by my spirit saith the lord
[1:39:22] that's why this was such a revelation to
[1:39:25] me because i always tried to do the
[1:39:27] mechanics to get the victory
[1:39:32] i'd make sure i paid my tithe i make
[1:39:34] sure i go to church i make sure i do all
[1:39:36] the things but that's not what's going
[1:39:38] to bring this body into subjection it's
[1:39:40] going to take the spark
[1:39:45] to do it
[1:39:48] i do someone sent me a beautiful quote
[1:39:51] and i was i could probably pull it up on
[1:39:53] my phone and read it but he says you do
[1:39:56] all that you can do
[1:39:57] that's the mechanics of it all
[1:40:01] but when you one day you realize wait a
[1:40:04] minute
[1:40:06] being free from lust being free from
[1:40:08] envy being free from malice
[1:40:12] being free from bitterness being free
[1:40:14] from gossip being free from
[1:40:18] envying
[1:40:20] strife
[1:40:21] and all the fruits of the flesh
[1:40:26] can be a reality
[1:40:31] i can overcome
[1:40:34] not we retake that scripture if the
[1:40:38] spirit that dwells in him it'll quicken
[1:40:40] this mortal body we've used that
[1:40:42] scripture over and over again placing it
[1:40:45] as a rapture
[1:40:48] one day i'll be changed one day i'll be
[1:40:50] changed but that's not what he's saying
[1:40:52] he says your body will be quickened now
[1:40:56] you will be conformed to the word now
[1:41:00] that's where it'll take place
[1:41:06] it's something i can look forward to
[1:41:09] that's a promise to me
[1:41:13] and i don't have to worry about
[1:41:15] popularity i don't have to worry about
[1:41:17] money don't have to worry about women
[1:41:20] those are the things the prophet said
[1:41:21] that i can have victory over all those
[1:41:24] things
[1:41:25] they become temptation
[1:41:31] but i got the power
[1:41:34] where did you get it
[1:41:39] i tried
[1:41:41] i tried with everything because my
[1:41:44] mechanics told me it was wrong
[1:41:50] my mechanics told me
[1:41:53] that you need this out you need that out
[1:41:56] you're doing wrong it's no good and i i
[1:42:00] you begin to see it oh i'm going to go
[1:42:02] clean this up i'm going to go fix this
[1:42:04] i'm going to go fix that
[1:42:06] and you labor in the mechanics you beat
[1:42:09] people down and you you drag them to the
[1:42:12] altar you're a sinner you're a sinner
[1:42:15] you you need to do this you need to do
[1:42:18] that always beating you down you know
[1:42:20] what the prophet of god said i'll just
[1:42:23] jump over and see if i can
[1:42:25] yeah he he said it
[1:42:27] he said it right here he said they are
[1:42:30] always taught to look down
[1:42:36] always taught to look down
[1:42:39] he said
[1:42:40] he said but now the dirt
[1:42:43] lay there in the sun one says oh it's
[1:42:45] too hot but it quickens that part of the
[1:42:48] dirt
[1:42:50] because the sun was set
[1:42:52] not the quicken the rock
[1:42:54] not the quicken the dirt but to quicken
[1:42:57] the life in the seed
[1:42:59] so it it he says now you guys i don't
[1:43:03] i don't a guy says he don't believe we
[1:43:05] read that he says
[1:43:06] now over here he talks about the little
[1:43:08] eagle he said he didn't even like the
[1:43:12] diet she was feeding him
[1:43:14] he just
[1:43:16] scratched around in the barnyard he
[1:43:18] wondered why he had to be
[1:43:21] the odd one around everywhere i like
[1:43:24] that and then
[1:43:26] uh let me see if i can find that
[1:43:27] statement i thought that yeah it's over
[1:43:29] on the other page
[1:43:31] so he's talking about this eagle and he
[1:43:32] comes down here and he gets down
[1:43:35] and he says
[1:43:37] he says
[1:43:39] so she was searching him and he says so
[1:43:41] does god
[1:43:43] he is the great eagle in his thoughts he
[1:43:45] knew he'd have a church
[1:43:49] okay he knew he'd have a church
[1:43:52] wait a minute
[1:43:56] i want to be a part of that
[1:43:59] what do i have to do
[1:44:02] what what what is it how is it done
[1:44:06] remember he says
[1:44:07] paragraph 123 so the bride must be flesh
[1:44:11] of his flesh bone of his bone then how
[1:44:14] is this mortal flesh going to become his
[1:44:18] flesh
[1:44:22] that's the question
[1:44:24] how is this mortal flesh going to become
[1:44:27] his flesh
[1:44:32] how is it done
[1:44:38] he says he says how become his flesh
[1:44:41] well we'll get to it in a minute see how
[1:44:43] is it done
[1:44:45] how
[1:44:46] what is the great
[1:44:48] transformation
[1:44:50] what is the thing the great
[1:44:53] transformation
[1:44:54] that's going to transform this flesh
[1:45:00] our mortal bodies this mortal body
[1:45:03] what is going to quicken
[1:45:06] this mortal body right here and
[1:45:09] transform
[1:45:11] this
[1:45:14] dirt to where this body
[1:45:20] is brought under subjection
[1:45:22] to his word
[1:45:25] it's a promise
[1:45:27] praise god it's a promise
[1:45:30] i can i can anticipate
[1:45:34] i can anticipate
[1:45:36] the victory
[1:45:38] over all the things that war against me
[1:45:43] but i begin to understand how that it
[1:45:45] does he finds me he quickens me and then
[1:45:50] i start hunting
[1:45:53] for that resurrected life
[1:45:57] in this body
[1:46:02] how am i gonna get it
[1:46:06] how am i gonna get there how's it done
[1:46:09] it's done by the feeding of eagle food
[1:46:15] that's how he's going to do it he's
[1:46:17] going to feed eagle food it isn't
[1:46:20] somebody trying to preach an experience
[1:46:22] that you've got an evidence that you've
[1:46:25] got the holy ghost it's a transformation
[1:46:28] god's power to transform
[1:46:31] every virtue that's in that seed into a
[1:46:35] total manifestation hallelujah
[1:46:39] in what
[1:46:40] in me
[1:46:41] and who in this flesh
[1:46:45] why because he said so
[1:46:53] not by will
[1:46:55] not by might
[1:46:56] but my spirit
[1:46:58] i know i can look i can see it when i'm
[1:47:00] standing here i i've learned to look at
[1:47:03] it in my own face
[1:47:08] when all the things that are wrong with
[1:47:10] my life
[1:47:12] are milling in my mind
[1:47:16] and i know there's a gap
[1:47:20] between
[1:47:21] what my flesh is really doing
[1:47:23] and my spirit and i find out that i'm
[1:47:26] two people
[1:47:28] i'm a i'm a flesh man
[1:47:33] and i'm a spirit man and i hate the
[1:47:37] disparagement
[1:47:39] between the two
[1:47:41] but i realize i can't live like that
[1:47:45] i can't live in the torment
[1:47:48] any longer of having something a part of
[1:47:52] me that doesn't conform to the word
[1:47:55] and i want that and i call for it but
[1:47:58] praise god there's a quickening spirit
[1:48:01] there's a spark there's an eagle food
[1:48:04] that can take this flesh the spirit and
[1:48:08] the mechanic and the spirit and bring
[1:48:11] them two together that the seed and the
[1:48:14] flesh become one hallelujah
[1:48:21] i could look forward to it
[1:48:27] i don't i don't care
[1:48:30] i've failed for so long
[1:48:35] i'd do good for maybe years and years
[1:48:37] and then flop
[1:48:40] and i can i go back and get all the
[1:48:42] mechanics right
[1:48:44] and now i'm realizing wait a minute
[1:48:46] there's a position
[1:48:49] there's a time
[1:48:51] there's a season
[1:48:54] finally the eagle food
[1:48:56] will come out
[1:48:58] finally the revelation will come forth
[1:49:01] finally it'll come out of the storehouse
[1:49:04] and feed me
[1:49:10] give to me
[1:49:13] the i said
[1:49:16] that i could live
[1:49:19] he said
[1:49:21] that dirt so
[1:49:23] we look and he says one day the story
[1:49:26] goes
[1:49:27] an old eagle flew over the barnyard and
[1:49:29] she was looking everywhere
[1:49:32] she found him
[1:49:35] oh
[1:49:37] for that resurrection
[1:49:40] to realize that he really wasn't a
[1:49:43] chicken
[1:49:44] after all he was an eagle
[1:49:50] that's the conflict
[1:49:52] am i chicken and my eagle do i got the
[1:49:55] holy ghost do i not got the holy ghost i
[1:49:58] am i'm a failure am i doing i'm
[1:50:01] struggling i'm struggling i'm struggling
[1:50:04] oh
[1:50:05] what what ends the struggle
[1:50:10] what ends the struggle
[1:50:12] the sheaf offering
[1:50:14] the wave offering that's why you sent
[1:50:16] malachi 4 5. that's why he sent
[1:50:19] revelations 10 7. that's why he turned
[1:50:21] his back to the audience it was not for
[1:50:23] the chicken
[1:50:25] it was for the eagle
[1:50:27] so you will know that this is an eagle
[1:50:30] you will know you have eagle food you
[1:50:33] know you have the word that will take
[1:50:35] you and transform you you don't have to
[1:50:37] look no place else there's not another
[1:50:39] place there's not another voice there's
[1:50:42] not another ministry this is him
[1:50:50] and it'll do what it's promised to do
[1:50:55] amen you think you can stop it
[1:50:59] no
[1:51:01] you might kick against the prick
[1:51:03] prophet of god said you'd save god and
[1:51:05] yourself a lot of trouble
[1:51:11] but you got to know there's not another
[1:51:13] thing
[1:51:15] you can't be lukewarm you can't serve
[1:51:18] two masters
[1:51:20] you've got to finally decide
[1:51:24] you've got to come to the place that you
[1:51:25] say i
[1:51:27] want my flesh
[1:51:30] resurrected
[1:51:34] i want what's in my spirit
[1:51:38] in my flesh
[1:51:44] it's like trying to fix the flesh with
[1:51:46] the flesh it can't be done
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:51] don't get mad at yourself
[1:51:53] be real with yourself
[1:51:58] if you're drawn away that's what sin is
[1:52:00] every man's trot away to his flesh
[1:52:04] it comes in his mind's drive but when
[1:52:06] it's finished it worketh death
[1:52:08] now there's a power
[1:52:12] not you mustered up
[1:52:16] it's at the same power
[1:52:18] that brought you the revelation
[1:52:21] has got to finish the work
[1:52:24] you understand he's got to finish the
[1:52:27] work he's got to quicken that body
[1:52:30] because that body contains his seed and
[1:52:33] that it'll never bring forth he's got to
[1:52:35] quicken the dirt along with the seed
[1:52:40] oh i love it
[1:52:42] i've got hope
[1:52:45] let's just look at what he how beautiful
[1:52:48] he says it he says oh
[1:52:50] oh that resurrection
[1:52:53] to recognize that he really wasn't a
[1:52:56] chicken after all he was an eagle he was
[1:53:00] always taught to look down
[1:53:06] you say what's that we're always taught
[1:53:08] to look down
[1:53:10] on our failures
[1:53:13] to look down
[1:53:15] oh i'm so terrible oh i i lost oh i i
[1:53:19] speak i i oh
[1:53:21] oh oh you're always taught to look down
[1:53:24] look down look down
[1:53:28] look at what a miserable wretch you are
[1:53:31] look at what a failure you are
[1:53:34] look at all the bad thoughts you have
[1:53:37] but wait a minute
[1:53:39] when i see these things come to pass
[1:53:42] when i see the signs of the end
[1:53:45] when i see the son of man
[1:53:49] appearing in the cloud
[1:53:52] i can look up
[1:53:55] because my redemption
[1:53:58] the redemption of my flesh
[1:54:01] the redemption of my failures
[1:54:04] my redemption draweth nigh i can look up
[1:54:07] my redemption comes my resurrection's
[1:54:10] going to come
[1:54:12] it's so beautiful he says
[1:54:16] and that's what our trouble is we've
[1:54:17] always been taught to look down
[1:54:19] but now we've got eagle food that says
[1:54:22] never never never have a negative
[1:54:25] thought believe all things are possible
[1:54:28] to them that believe can you imagine the
[1:54:31] same faith that you would pray for
[1:54:33] somebody is the same faith that you can
[1:54:36] use to overcome something in your life
[1:54:39] that you know is evil that you know is
[1:54:41] wrong that you know you're doing that
[1:54:44] you're enslaved to
[1:54:47] you have the victory over that by divine
[1:54:50] revelation of his word when you come to
[1:54:53] the place and say wait a minute you're
[1:54:56] not going to hold me down you're not
[1:54:58] going to keep me in bondage i had
[1:55:00] there's a power
[1:55:01] that i'm going to ask for to come down
[1:55:04] and quicken this flesh and bring it into
[1:55:08] subjection to the word
[1:55:11] oh
[1:55:13] what a glorious resurrection that was
[1:55:16] what a glorious resurrection this is
[1:55:19] this flesh being resurrected into the
[1:55:23] quickening power of god in it having
[1:55:25] control over me
[1:55:31] oh my
[1:55:33] oh my
[1:55:36] let's just read this
[1:55:38] here he said
[1:55:40] and the barnyard and he heard a scream
[1:55:43] it said look up this way
[1:55:46] and he looked up above him
[1:55:49] and there was a creature
[1:55:51] with 14 feet wings
[1:55:54] powerful
[1:55:55] than all the chickens
[1:55:57] there was in the barnyard
[1:56:00] and claimed him
[1:56:02] to be
[1:56:04] her son
[1:56:06] what do you think god's been doing
[1:56:09] you're my son
[1:56:11] your name's on my book you're in my
[1:56:14] thinking
[1:56:16] so
[1:56:17] we always use that
[1:56:19] for our soul
[1:56:22] and for our spirit
[1:56:26] we always use it for the hope
[1:56:29] that we'll be there someday
[1:56:31] but i'm telling you you can take that
[1:56:33] same promise and use it for your
[1:56:36] deliverance
[1:56:37] use it for your healing
[1:56:39] use it for your complexes
[1:56:42] music for everything you can use that
[1:56:45] same word promise that quickens you in
[1:56:47] the spirit to quicken you in the flesh
[1:56:52] oh god
[1:56:54] i'm just i just want that spirit so bad
[1:57:01] amen i know
[1:57:03] i know by word promise
[1:57:09] that i can have victory
[1:57:11] not in myself
[1:57:14] but in him
[1:57:16] all things are possible
[1:57:21] he says
[1:57:22] he said mama
[1:57:25] how can i get to you she said jump
[1:57:28] start flopping your rings
[1:57:30] you're an eagle
[1:57:33] start believing for it
[1:57:38] you got a problem quit looking down
[1:57:42] look up
[1:57:45] there's someone that can deliver me mama
[1:57:47] you can deliver me from this chicken
[1:57:49] yard i'm in
[1:57:51] you can deliver me from this scratch i'm
[1:57:54] feeding on these bugs i'm feeding on
[1:57:57] this garbage i'm feeding on
[1:58:00] you've come by here to deliver me
[1:58:04] the reason you came by was to tell me
[1:58:07] you don't have to eat that anymore
[1:58:14] you got to just start flapping your
[1:58:16] wings
[1:58:21] she knew
[1:58:22] she had a son somewhere
[1:58:24] no matter what he's been raised up in
[1:58:28] she's got a son
[1:58:30] somewhere
[1:58:32] he said god was the great eagle
[1:58:34] didn't matter what you're raised up in
[1:58:39] i love that
[1:58:42] but i always wanted what was my way of
[1:58:44] deliverance
[1:58:45] i hope i can make that clear to you
[1:58:48] always trying to use the mechanics
[1:58:51] always trying to use the religion
[1:58:54] always trying to use the rules i'll tell
[1:58:57] you what i'll do i'll get over this i'll
[1:58:59] listen to a tape and read my bible every
[1:59:01] day
[1:59:04] i won't miss a service
[1:59:06] i'll do this if you can do one thing for
[1:59:08] your salvation he died in vain
[1:59:18] eat the food
[1:59:20] that's right
[1:59:22] eat the food
[1:59:24] there's no other food provided through
[1:59:26] this bride that didn't come through
[1:59:28] william mary and branham
[1:59:31] they don't even use his name hardly in
[1:59:33] church anymore
[1:59:38] they won't even say it
[1:59:41] they've separated the messenger
[1:59:44] from the message
[1:59:48] they separated the eagle
[1:59:50] from the food
[1:59:56] you know what he told the ministry to do
[1:59:59] break down the eagle food
[2:00:02] not come up with messages
[2:00:05] not come up with sermons there's a time
[2:00:07] to do that
[2:00:12] but
[2:00:13] we don't have a message
[2:00:17] you understand the son of man ministry
[2:00:20] was the resurrection life
[2:00:24] to have a resurrection
[2:00:27] let's just read just a little bit
[2:00:29] and
[2:00:31] and
[2:00:32] uh
[2:00:33] it just marvelous we'll just go down he
[2:00:36] says
[2:00:37] so she knew she had a son
[2:00:40] and god knows hallelujah he's got a
[2:00:43] predestinated foreign church he knows
[2:00:46] he's got sons and daughters
[2:00:48] and a bride waiting somewhere
[2:00:51] and when the holy spirit begins to fly
[2:00:53] over it
[2:00:55] the wave sheath
[2:00:58] you understand you may be in this
[2:01:00] message for a long time be till that
[2:01:03] message really starts waving over you
[2:01:07] why is it going to start waving over you
[2:01:09] why all of a sudden in your life all of
[2:01:11] a sudden
[2:01:15] working on you working on your life
[2:01:16] working on your heart working on your
[2:01:18] spirit not mommy's religion not daddy's
[2:01:21] religion but it begins to work because
[2:01:23] it finally found you
[2:01:26] it's finally your hour
[2:01:28] it's finally your time
[2:01:32] i'd love to force it on my kids
[2:01:36] and i forced it pretty hard on them the
[2:01:39] mechanics
[2:01:41] you know and what did they do they just
[2:01:43] got in wreck after wreck after wreck
[2:01:45] after wreck but one day
[2:01:48] one day that holy spirit began to go
[2:01:52] over them and that russia mighty wind
[2:01:55] come in that sheath was waved you've got
[2:01:58] to understand what is the sheaf it's the
[2:02:01] word of god waived by luke 17 30 the
[2:02:05] ministry of the son of man you will
[2:02:07] never be able to separate it there's no
[2:02:10] life outside of it
[2:02:12] you can claim jesus christ 2000 years
[2:02:15] ago but this is jesus christ today
[2:02:19] not the flesh of william adam but the
[2:02:21] spirit that quickened william branham's
[2:02:24] body
[2:02:26] that that body
[2:02:27] came in
[2:02:29] and where paul could say be ye a
[2:02:31] follower of me as i am of christ
[2:02:39] he said he says
[2:02:40] oh my the same yesterday today and
[2:02:43] forever not some mystical story but a
[2:02:46] reality
[2:02:47] paragraph 142
[2:02:49] no matter
[2:02:50] how many tried to tell him
[2:02:52] an eagle he didn't know what an eagle
[2:02:56] was
[2:03:00] he didn't know what an eagle was
[2:03:03] you can't become something you don't
[2:03:06] know
[2:03:09] you understand that
[2:03:11] you can't become something you don't
[2:03:13] know
[2:03:15] so what did he first have to do to you
[2:03:18] he have to reveal it to you
[2:03:21] he had to reveal his spirit he had to
[2:03:23] reveal his word he had to reveal the
[2:03:26] ministry then he had to reveal to you
[2:03:28] that you were seed
[2:03:30] now
[2:03:32] after that's happened
[2:03:35] now you know what you're to become
[2:03:42] because he put an example
[2:03:44] what was the example it was the sheaf
[2:03:48] that was waved it was the first fruit
[2:03:51] that was waved
[2:03:53] and what does it do when i see it and i
[2:03:57] recognize we read this quote earlier he
[2:03:59] says it shows you that you've been
[2:04:01] accepted
[2:04:02] that you too
[2:04:04] will come in
[2:04:06] so i got bugs on me praise god he'll
[2:04:09] spray the bugs
[2:04:11] uh i've got bad leaves on me praise god
[2:04:14] he'll pluck the leaves let the husbandry
[2:04:17] dig it up at the roots that have done it
[2:04:19] with the word of god that it will be
[2:04:22] barren or unfruitful
[2:04:25] oh my we're in the greatest our church
[2:04:28] it's your time to get serious with god
[2:04:31] it's time to get on board it's time to
[2:04:34] recognize the world it's time to realize
[2:04:36] this isn't an emotional outbreak this is
[2:04:39] bodies
[2:04:41] bodies human flesh bodies
[2:04:44] coming subject to the word of god
[2:04:46] emotions thinking everything
[2:04:51] becoming one with the bridegroom
[2:04:55] hallelujah
[2:04:57] he didn't even know what an eagle was
[2:05:00] you didn't know
[2:05:03] if you would have known you would have
[2:05:07] but he had to reveal it to you
[2:05:09] he had to bottle feed us
[2:05:12] year after year
[2:05:14] taking a little food
[2:05:16] till we grow into that
[2:05:18] taking a little food till we grow into
[2:05:20] that do you understand this revelation
[2:05:22] of this resurrection of this body
[2:05:25] 10 15 years ago would have choked us to
[2:05:27] death yes
[2:05:30] we wouldn't even believe it was possible
[2:05:34] but now we can actually believe
[2:05:40] that this wretched
[2:05:42] man that i am
[2:05:45] when i would do good
[2:05:48] evil's present
[2:05:49] but praise god for christ jesus
[2:05:53] paul didn't leave it there
[2:05:57] he didn't even know what an eagle
[2:05:59] was
[2:06:01] yet he was an eagle
[2:06:03] he would not understood it
[2:06:06] until he seen something that reflected
[2:06:10] him
[2:06:11] that he reflected
[2:06:14] rather would have never understood it
[2:06:18] you would have never understood it
[2:06:21] without this message
[2:06:23] without this eagle
[2:06:25] without this vindication you didn't even
[2:06:28] know your eagles
[2:06:30] now you know your eagles
[2:06:33] now we're starting to know that we're
[2:06:35] eagles
[2:06:38] and we'll just hurry here
[2:06:42] he says what is it then
[2:06:45] when you see not a denomination not a
[2:06:47] phd not an lld not a good neighbor
[2:06:53] you see
[2:06:55] that's everybody's definition of
[2:06:56] christianity
[2:06:59] a good neighbor a good doctor a good
[2:07:02] teacher a good church
[2:07:05] program said i've seen pride
[2:07:07] brides in churches and churches that
[2:07:09] i'll tell you that statement floored me
[2:07:13] especially when you have everybody
[2:07:14] running around every time saying we're
[2:07:15] the bride we're the bride we're the
[2:07:17] bride wait a minute
[2:07:19] where's the resurrection of your flesh
[2:07:29] he said a good neighbor but a son of god
[2:07:32] molded into the image of god
[2:07:35] with a dynamic power of god to answer
[2:07:39] the request
[2:07:41] of the day
[2:07:45] how many really have heard life's story
[2:07:48] of how this vessel
[2:07:50] was molded
[2:07:52] and what was he to answer the request
[2:07:56] what is the request you know what my
[2:07:58] request is brother billy that this flesh
[2:08:05] any real true
[2:08:06] person that loves the lord
[2:08:09] wants this flesh
[2:08:13] to come into subjection
[2:08:16] to god's word
[2:08:18] he knows he's a believer he believes
[2:08:21] what he hears the only problem he's got
[2:08:24] is his flesh
[2:08:25] and the request is lord let this flesh
[2:08:33] come into
[2:08:34] subjection i don't want the enemy to
[2:08:37] have dominion and power over me
[2:08:40] i want to be free
[2:08:45] to meet the request of the day
[2:08:47] that he's the same yesterday today and
[2:08:50] forever
[2:08:52] and there ain't no hen
[2:08:54] going to hold you
[2:08:57] i'm tired of old satan hand
[2:08:59] clucking around in our lives
[2:09:03] hunts for his mama
[2:09:05] he's an eagle to begin with he
[2:09:08] recognizes
[2:09:10] this real eagle recognizes the call
[2:09:14] of god's word
[2:09:20] do you understand what this message is
[2:09:22] calling us to
[2:09:24] be perfect
[2:09:26] because he's perfect the message has a
[2:09:28] call
[2:09:33] oh
[2:09:34] aren't you glad you've been called
[2:09:38] he wouldn't call you
[2:09:41] abraham's faith was he wouldn't promise
[2:09:44] me
[2:09:45] if he wasn't able
[2:09:46] he wouldn't call me if he wasn't able to
[2:09:49] complete
[2:09:50] because the scripture says if he starts
[2:09:52] a work in you he'll finish it you know
[2:09:55] what we're seeing now we're seeing the
[2:09:57] finish
[2:10:01] this is the finish
[2:10:04] victory
[2:10:07] victory over myself
[2:10:09] praise god
[2:10:11] oh i've been wanting it so long i hate
[2:10:14] this guy
[2:10:17] don't worry son
[2:10:19] i'll deliver you from yourself
[2:10:24] a real eagle recognized the call of
[2:10:26] god's word why he's an eagle
[2:10:29] a eagle to an
[2:10:32] eagle
[2:10:36] this message is to you because you are
[2:10:39] it
[2:10:40] it's evil to an eagle you're not a
[2:10:43] follower
[2:10:47] you understand you're not a follower
[2:10:50] in in the sense of just following like
[2:10:53] this he gave a beautiful he says there
[2:10:55] was one great bird
[2:10:57] that sat on the pond remember that story
[2:10:59] brother tim and he said at a certain
[2:11:02] season
[2:11:04] this one eagle knew
[2:11:06] it was time
[2:11:07] and he made the call
[2:11:09] and all the
[2:11:11] the geese
[2:11:12] and the ducks gathered around him and he
[2:11:15] set out on the flight
[2:11:18] they all were geese
[2:11:23] the the call
[2:11:25] inspired them
[2:11:27] to flap their wings
[2:11:30] and to start flying
[2:11:33] he says why he's an eagle eagle to eagle
[2:11:37] the word before
[2:11:39] the foundation
[2:11:41] of the world
[2:11:45] how long do you want to stay here
[2:11:47] if i'm getting too long please i'm going
[2:11:50] to take two week vacation i want to go
[2:11:52] out war out i want to empty out
[2:11:56] amen
[2:11:58] the word before the foundation of the
[2:12:00] world that's what's calling you
[2:12:03] not present-day work
[2:12:05] brother rem didn't preach the word from
[2:12:10] 1941 or whenever his ministry started he
[2:12:13] was preaching the word before the
[2:12:15] foundation of the world
[2:12:18] he was preaching the spoken word which
[2:12:20] was the original seed he wasn't
[2:12:22] preaching the man-made seed and then he
[2:12:25] come and exposed the enemy that added
[2:12:28] all his junk to it
[2:12:32] the word from the foundation
[2:12:36] the word
[2:12:37] to the word
[2:12:40] the word
[2:12:41] predestinated to the written word for
[2:12:44] the hour you realize your position he's
[2:12:48] hunting for it
[2:12:51] the written word
[2:12:56] which was from the follow finds the word
[2:13:01] the truth of it
[2:13:02] the revelation
[2:13:04] of it
[2:13:05] and and now what is the effect
[2:13:08] of that great thing and he goes on talks
[2:13:11] he sees talk about this power
[2:13:13] this hunt quickly
[2:13:15] we want to know how
[2:13:17] he could get there he wanted to know how
[2:13:20] he could get there
[2:13:22] with her
[2:13:23] he had been taught
[2:13:25] he couldn't do that
[2:13:34] that's what the hens taught
[2:13:36] they still teach it in their churches
[2:13:38] you can't be like jesus you can't do the
[2:13:41] works that he did you can't have the
[2:13:44] life they do that they taught you
[2:13:46] couldn't do it
[2:13:51] half the people are preaching
[2:13:57] this message as religion
[2:13:59] as denomination
[2:14:03] he knew he had a church he knew he had
[2:14:05] sons and daughters he knew that there
[2:14:07] would be people that manifest in their
[2:14:09] flesh that he's the same yesterday today
[2:14:12] and forever but what did they do
[2:14:15] they taught
[2:14:16] that he couldn't do that
[2:14:19] you can't get no higher
[2:14:21] than you can jump
[2:14:24] oh my goodness
[2:14:29] satan you're exposed
[2:14:35] he tells you
[2:14:40] look at the way you're living
[2:14:42] you can't get no higher
[2:14:44] you got lead weights on you you've got
[2:14:46] sin you've got all this stuff you've got
[2:14:48] all these troubles you can't get no
[2:14:50] higher than that oh you lying devil
[2:14:55] you've held me down long enough with
[2:14:57] that you've held me down long enough
[2:14:59] trying to get the mechanics to get all
[2:15:02] that right i can't do it but one thing i
[2:15:04] can do i can look for that same healing
[2:15:07] power that same quickening power not the
[2:15:10] same one that healed my flesh to heal my
[2:15:12] sin to heal my body to heal my doubts
[2:15:18] to take me
[2:15:20] higher
[2:15:22] then i can jump
[2:15:30] i can live higher
[2:15:32] than i'm living
[2:15:34] not by power
[2:15:36] not by might not by my will but by my
[2:15:40] spirit
[2:15:41] saith the lord
[2:15:43] quit trying to produce it
[2:15:46] it's killing you
[2:15:49] it's free
[2:15:52] you don't have to prove nothing
[2:15:54] your past is wiped out it's in the sea
[2:15:57] of god forgetfulness it's fresh today
[2:16:04] well i wish you knew how much he was
[2:16:06] here
[2:16:13] he couldn't get no higher
[2:16:16] look at the chickens
[2:16:21] that's what they say look at the
[2:16:22] chickens
[2:16:24] you can't get no higher look around
[2:16:27] look at all the other chickens look at
[2:16:30] all the other churches look at all the
[2:16:32] preachers look at all the believers quit
[2:16:34] looking at the chicken
[2:16:37] look at the wave offering
[2:16:41] eat the eagle food
[2:16:46] this is all right here
[2:16:48] this is what he's saying
[2:16:50] i'm not saying it you understand i'm
[2:16:52] just reading it
[2:16:54] i'm just repeating it
[2:16:56] but he stands in his word
[2:16:59] the same yesterday
[2:17:00] today
[2:17:02] and forever
[2:17:04] no matter what the chickens are
[2:17:08] you're an eagle
[2:17:11] just start spreading those wings just
[2:17:14] get a little exercise in them start
[2:17:17] moving up the word to the word it works
[2:17:21] that i do shall you do also he said that
[2:17:25] if you believe in me the works that i do
[2:17:27] you shall do also see because i live he
[2:17:30] lives also you know what one of the
[2:17:32] other works jesus did was get behind me
[2:17:36] satan
[2:17:38] we forget that work
[2:17:41] he could have never done what he did
[2:17:43] until he told satan to get behind him
[2:17:47] until he accepted
[2:17:51] that's in the message perfect faith
[2:17:54] until he accepted what god made them
[2:17:57] beautiful message
[2:18:01] exercise then
[2:18:02] the word to word
[2:18:05] the works that i do shall you do also
[2:18:07] because i live
[2:18:10] he lives also
[2:18:12] and if the spirit that raised him from
[2:18:14] the dead dwells in you it will quicken
[2:18:17] your
[2:18:18] mortal body
[2:18:20] this is the promise
[2:18:22] it'll quicken this mortal body
[2:18:25] what
[2:18:26] does it do now listen
[2:18:29] so that you all know
[2:18:32] and this is easter
[2:18:34] i want it to mean more to you than any
[2:18:37] other easter ever did see i want you to
[2:18:40] see it
[2:18:41] we know what it's done for him
[2:18:44] but i want you to see not will it's
[2:18:47] already done the same for you
[2:18:50] what does it do
[2:18:54] it quickens the mortal body
[2:18:59] not quicken you to
[2:19:02] another body
[2:19:06] it quickens this mortal body that we
[2:19:09] live in
[2:19:11] it quickens it
[2:19:13] in other words brings it to life
[2:19:18] so the same life that's in you now he's
[2:19:21] going to quicken that body and bring
[2:19:23] this body to life
[2:19:26] so the life that's in your heart the
[2:19:28] life that's in the
[2:19:30] your mind the life that's in your spirit
[2:19:33] is now actually going to come into your
[2:19:36] flesh
[2:19:37] all the chickens say you can't do it
[2:19:42] you can't jump no higher than you're
[2:19:44] living right now you are stuck
[2:19:48] keep looking down
[2:19:53] tweet just keep bringing everybody down
[2:19:56] around you
[2:20:04] the spirit nobody no preacher wants
[2:20:06] anybody to fly higher
[2:20:08] i wish you'd all fly higher than me i
[2:20:10] need help
[2:20:16] i'd hate to rely on a sick preacher to
[2:20:18] pray for me all the time
[2:20:24] i hope
[2:20:25] my spirit's right
[2:20:30] and then he talked you once walked it
[2:20:32] talked about
[2:20:33] and he says and he says then right in
[2:20:36] the middle of that the paragraph 49 he
[2:20:38] says he'll also bring your mortal bodies
[2:20:41] the dust of the earth
[2:20:43] into subjection
[2:20:46] so he wants to make it clear
[2:20:49] that it's actually your flesh
[2:20:55] this flesh
[2:20:57] it'll actually bring this flesh
[2:21:00] your mortal bodies the dust of the earth
[2:21:03] into ejection you see
[2:21:05] what is it subjected to what christ who
[2:21:08] is christ the word not theology but the
[2:21:11] word
[2:21:13] then you say that these things oh i
[2:21:15] think it's all right for this or that
[2:21:17] and he talks all and he goes down he
[2:21:19] says but brother
[2:21:21] paragraph
[2:21:23] 54. brother when you heard that scream
[2:21:26] there was something in you
[2:21:28] you're an eagle to begin with why you
[2:21:32] are the seed
[2:21:33] the resurrection
[2:21:35] of the s-o-n
[2:21:38] has drawn
[2:21:39] has drawed and the sheaf wave
[2:21:42] upon the earth
[2:21:44] to make you recognize that you are an
[2:21:47] eagle
[2:21:48] not a denominational chicken
[2:21:50] if the spirit that raised him from the
[2:21:52] dead the word
[2:21:54] that dynamic of the word dwells in you
[2:21:57] it quickens also your mortal body
[2:22:00] well the first thing he had to let you
[2:22:02] know
[2:22:03] is that spirit was dwelling in you
[2:22:10] you can't become something that you
[2:22:12] don't know
[2:22:15] now you know it
[2:22:19] and
[2:22:21] you got this flesh
[2:22:24] now he's telling you
[2:22:26] don't be discouraged
[2:22:29] i'll quicken your mortal body too
[2:22:33] oh thank you
[2:22:36] might not mean anything to you
[2:22:39] but i live so long for this
[2:22:44] it'll bring your mortal bodies objecting
[2:22:46] to the word
[2:22:48] then you say and he comes i said my
[2:22:50] brother when you hear that scream
[2:22:53] you're a seed paragraph 154
[2:22:56] and that resurrection of the sun has
[2:22:59] drawn the wave sheath
[2:23:01] upon the earth to make you realize that
[2:23:04] you are an eagle
[2:23:05] not a denominational chicken if the
[2:23:07] spirit that raised him is dead the word
[2:23:09] dynamic word dwells in you it will also
[2:23:12] quicken your mortal body
[2:23:14] now
[2:23:15] now how
[2:23:18] we flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[2:23:21] because quickly while we're yet mortal
[2:23:24] sinners mortal
[2:23:26] ready to die these bodies it quickens
[2:23:29] that body
[2:23:30] what a quickening
[2:23:33] life
[2:23:35] the spirit
[2:23:36] that once
[2:23:38] like to drink
[2:23:39] and run around and commit adultery and
[2:23:42] all that is quickened
[2:23:45] why the things die
[2:23:47] and you are
[2:23:49] resurrected
[2:23:51] the quickening
[2:23:52] of your mortal body
[2:23:55] the real you
[2:23:57] is resurrected
[2:24:01] in flesh
[2:24:05] what good does it do
[2:24:07] if
[2:24:08] the real you is still an old flesh
[2:24:11] you can't put new wine
[2:24:14] in an old body
[2:24:20] this is the gospel
[2:24:22] this is what he's been preaching
[2:24:24] this is what he's been telling us no
[2:24:26] wonder they rejected it
[2:24:29] because
[2:24:30] they wanted the un
[2:24:32] believer in their midst
[2:24:35] they didn't care they wanted numbers
[2:24:42] he says therefore
[2:24:44] this in paragraph 56
[2:24:47] therefore your body is the temple of the
[2:24:50] dynamics
[2:24:51] because why from the beginning you are a
[2:24:55] part of the dynamics oh there
[2:24:58] is
[2:24:59] your
[2:25:00] resurrection
[2:25:05] what is the resurrection
[2:25:08] it's this
[2:25:10] man
[2:25:11] dying
[2:25:14] and being resurrected
[2:25:16] into full obedience and becoming the
[2:25:19] word
[2:25:20] as he is the word
[2:25:22] together there's the church
[2:25:25] in the resurrection
[2:25:27] with him
[2:25:28] these bodies
[2:25:30] right now are quickened
[2:25:32] you see
[2:25:33] you've heard it
[2:25:34] you believe
[2:25:36] it changed you from denomination to the
[2:25:40] word or whatever
[2:25:42] you are
[2:25:44] he says
[2:25:46] a stranger
[2:25:47] will hear my voice and they will not
[2:25:50] follow but we follow
[2:25:53] and so
[2:25:54] you ask where's this message taking you
[2:25:59] we've been so interested in going up
[2:26:03] that we haven't been interested in the
[2:26:05] resurrection that's here
[2:26:11] the resurrection
[2:26:14] of the real david mcgarry
[2:26:17] this dirt
[2:26:19] being quickened to life
[2:26:21] in his life
[2:26:24] that if christ be in you
[2:26:28] he's got to be in you
[2:26:31] it then
[2:26:32] by that spirit
[2:26:34] will quicken this flesh
[2:26:39] oh
[2:26:40] it ends the conflict
[2:26:44] it's so wonderful
[2:26:46] that that's also promised
[2:26:49] i hope you can see it
[2:26:52] what a resurrection that was
[2:26:55] what a resurrection
[2:26:57] this is i preached
[2:26:59] a long time
[2:27:01] but
[2:27:03] i i just i i can't
[2:27:06] i just don't want to say it
[2:27:08] and read it and preach it and
[2:27:11] act like it's mine
[2:27:15] you know there's a lot of ministers i
[2:27:16] know them i'm not against preachers
[2:27:19] but they'll put they'll put one of
[2:27:21] brother brandon's quotes
[2:27:23] in their sermons
[2:27:25] and they just preach along and they read
[2:27:27] the quote just as part of their sermon
[2:27:33] it's plagiarism it's what it is
[2:27:38] but you know why because so many people
[2:27:41] get embarrassed when you say brother
[2:27:43] branham said
[2:27:45] i think i'm going to say it a different
[2:27:46] way jesus christ said through brother
[2:27:49] branham
[2:27:52] jesus christ used brother branham to say
[2:27:55] this
[2:27:56] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[2:28:00] christ because it's the power of god
[2:28:04] unto salvation
[2:28:07] can you imagine them rejecting
[2:28:12] i think of that clip brother andrew when
[2:28:14] he says you want to get all that
[2:28:17] suspicion you want to get all that fear
[2:28:20] you want to get all that doubt
[2:28:23] out of your heart do you want to come
[2:28:25] under one headship you and your body
[2:28:27] united with him he starts going to the
[2:28:30] place discerning everybody and finally
[2:28:32] he looks down he says you
[2:28:34] on that cot
[2:28:36] rise up
[2:28:40] it's tremendous
[2:28:42] i think i can play that
[2:28:45] where's my phone
[2:28:48] go go get it
[2:28:51] do you have it on your phone
[2:28:54] andrew can play it
[2:28:56] just play that one minute clip
[2:29:02] okay
[2:29:11] united under one head ship
[2:29:14] i think it's may 26 1958
[2:29:18] i'm guessing
[2:29:25] and then if you just go go up about five
[2:29:28] minutes ahead of that
[2:29:38] no it's so old i don't think it's got
[2:29:40] paragraph numbers
[2:29:43] it's right towards the end of the
[2:29:44] service
[2:29:47] so if you just go from the end up 10
[2:29:49] minutes
[2:29:50] i think we should have it
[2:29:55] you talk about quickening power
[2:30:00] you're going to hear discernment healing
[2:30:02] but you understand the same thing that
[2:30:04] healed them
[2:30:05] is the same thing that brings your flesh
[2:30:10] yeah just start right there
[2:30:22] how many people you're sick raise your
[2:30:24] hand
[2:30:27] or believe
[2:30:30] just believe me believe that the king is

[2:30:37] nails start christ his spirit
[2:30:41] is in the camp
[2:30:43] let him come into the little apartment
[2:30:44] of yours that he wants to come into
[2:30:48] they come in and say i'm the king
[2:30:50] don't pay no attention what the bishop
[2:30:52] says i'm the king amen
[2:30:56] i'm the king
[2:30:58] you believe my words i am the same king
[2:31:01] that walked in galilee

[2:44:31] of god
[2:44:32] may this word live
[2:44:34] and not only might live in my heart
[2:44:38] and in my mind
[2:44:40] but may this body be resurrected that it
[2:44:44] too
[2:44:45] becomes
[2:44:46] the word of god god bless you let's
[2:44:48] stand to our feet
[2:44:51] those of you that stood up and acted on
[2:44:53] the word of god
[2:44:55] you know god
[2:44:57] he's almost obligated to give you
[2:45:00] you know everybody uses that word god's
[2:45:02] obligated to heal you
[2:45:05] give you children whatever you ask for
[2:45:09] oh my
[2:45:12] i love them tonight thank you for
[2:45:14] letting me minister my heart and
[2:45:17] and you know i
[2:45:19] i've got nothing to hide
[2:45:22] you know what i mean
[2:45:23] it ain't my message
[2:45:26] i didn't preach it
[2:45:27] i didn't come up with it
[2:45:30] i don't interpret it
[2:45:32] it's on its own
[2:45:34] god vindicated through what you've seen
[2:45:37] that who was standing there
[2:45:39] was the king of kings the lord of glory
[2:45:43] sending that sheaf offering
[2:45:45] to gather his eagles up to eat eagle
[2:45:48] food
[2:45:49] that their bodies
[2:45:52] mortal bodies can be quickened into the
[2:45:55] word
[2:45:56] and then his spirits and her they become
[2:45:59] one and these two that were twain
[2:46:02] become one flesh she is him
[2:46:05] it's not a reality
[2:46:07] until it's in your flesh so i know we're
[2:46:11] not there
[2:46:13] but the question was how do i get there
[2:46:17] how is it done

[2:56:38] heavenly father we come to you tonight
[2:56:40] lord many things were said tonight lord
[2:56:42] that
[2:56:43] we look back over our life and it's not
[2:56:46] what we've done for you lord but it's
[2:56:47] the testimony that you've given us
[2:56:50] lord even brother david mentioned that
[2:56:52] maybe things that could have been
[2:56:53] preached 5 10 15 years ago
[2:56:57] lord it seems like they have a different
[2:56:58] meaning right now
[2:57:00] it seems like we're going in the
[2:57:01] storehouse lord and what you've had
[2:57:03] planned for us and
[2:57:04] or the revelation that you're breaking
[2:57:06] forth it means so much to us right now
[2:57:09] lord may they not just be words that are
[2:57:11] preached may there not be to be things
[2:57:13] that are said or things that come across
[2:57:15] this pulpit lord that
[2:57:16] that feel good to our ears lord but as
[2:57:19] brother david said may they be anchored
[2:57:20] down in our soul lord that seed is
[2:57:23] ripening
[2:57:24] we don't know how much longer we have
[2:57:25] left on this earth lord but we just want
[2:57:27] to reflect you
[2:57:30] lord we know that there's a time and a
[2:57:31] place and
[2:57:32] the rapture is not just an event lord
[2:57:34] it's a process but that process is
[2:57:36] coming closer and closer may we be ready
[2:57:38] we make ourselves available
[2:57:41] or we let our spirits lord be washed by
[2:57:43] your word
[2:57:45] or we think about our loved ones we
[2:57:46] think about those out there that we've
[2:57:48] witnessed too and that we've put before
[2:57:50] you lord and even those prodigal sons
[2:57:52] and daughters lord that may not be
[2:57:54] serving you as we'd want lord our family
[2:57:56] members we remember them lord and we
[2:57:58] just ask that lord even as on the tape
[2:58:00] it said maybe not just a miracle or but
[2:58:02] we ask for mercy we love you we commit
[2:58:05] all things into your hands and we ask
[2:58:06] these things in jesus name amen
