in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you um i'm going to be gone this weekend i know some of you are planning to come to missouri i think that's wonderful it's a little ways away about 500 miles but it doesn't take you if you go the speed limit you can get there in about eight hours if you stretch it a little bit you can get there in seven hours but i can only tell you to go the speed limit and uh so anyway uh uh we're looking forward uh to that so uh uh bill brother billy is going uh uh with us to help us there and so uh uh well well we're gone uh so brother matthew and jackson they'll kind of be watching the church uh for us so if something major comes up get in touch with uh uh one of those two brothers and uh brother randy's gonna preach for us sunday morning brother matthew's gonna take care of the service and for us and and then a sunday evening brother matthew will preach and so we don't get very often where so many of the ministers are gone but praise god we've got real good ministers just to sit right in there and we have a wonderful gospel and we these men stay right with it and so it'll be a great thing so if something major comes up or something just reach out to one of these brothers brother matthew brother jackson and uh they'll get everything certainly uh taken care of if anything happens and they'll know how to get in touch with me also so we want to fellowship just a little bit tonight we won't be long but just as we go along into this great message with this melchizedek we're going to play a little portion tonight of it and and start to just lay out some things that are in front of us for a few moments so if you have your bibles let's turn to the book of ephesians and the second chapter of the book of ephesians and we're going to start with the fourth verse and read down and as you read this you've got to remember the ephesian church being gentiles were there was a great question about circumcision and about obeying the law and trying to bring the gentile into the same manner of religion as the jews were walking in many of the jews wanted to establish holidays and and the same things in fact we know that peter and and paul had a great discussion on that topic uh when uh peter kind of withdrew and went over and sat with the jews and the the gentile brethren were set off to one side i've looked at a lot of the things of the jewish faith and and things i'm i'm glad god made me a gentile i mean that might sound terrible but uh it's good so once you just once you understand this conflict of origin you know what i mean and this well we're more holy and you or we're original and all those things you see how that paul answers this question and as we go through it for just a minute while we read then you you should we'll be able to tie it back to what's being revealed and who is this balchezitec so let's read this together i'm not a very good reader so fill in the blanks and the words i mispronounce it says but god ephesians the second chapter and the fourth verse but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us so now we're talking about all the motivation that god has for what that he did he so loved the world he gave his only begotten son so god had great love for his creation and his plan you say how could he have great love because it all came from him we've been studying this in melchizedek everything that was made was made by him and he is love so he had to love what that he was and what that he manifested because it was his attribute i hope that's not raises too many wheels turning but even when we were dead in sin hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved even when we are dead in sin hath he quickened us together with christ that's predestination by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus god bless you bless the word you may be seated as we continue to read so this great love that he had for us uh even when we were yet sinners this uh love had uh already quickened us together so it was it was something that uh was going to be done do you understand you might as well you could have stamped it and sealed it that it's going to happen so there is nothing going to keep it from happening and so he said quickness together for by grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god so we see that that he's taking us out of the picture as far as anything that can be done for our salvation and again all these things are laid down in the manifestation of who melchizedek was that he was the priest and and we're going to listen to that and and so we see this great beautiful uh uh uh faith and not of ourselves it's a gift of god so he's telling the gentiles here the the jews didn't even earn it but keeping the law by doing all these things salvation is a gift of god we well we were yet sinners he died for us and he quickened us into the things of god so it wasn't uh something that uh was great and he says not of works lest any man should boast so here again is the jew saying well we don't eat things strangled and we don't eat this and we don't do this and we don't do this we're sanctified we're quote unquote the chosen people we are the children of god and remember for all these years they had a disdain for the gentiles because they were unclean and uh the they didn't uh they didn't practice even what became to jews just common sanitation they washed things they washed their pots they washed their hands they've done many things in fact many of the people attributed in the days of the black plague and the plagues that said across europe uh many times the the jewish people didn't suff suffer the death rate that everybody else does but it was because of their cleanliness packages they didn't eat like certain things that were considered unclean and so it had great benefits so we see that this this thing's beginning to unfold and paul's telling the gentiles he says you're saved by grace it's a gift that god gave you not of works unless any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them we're going to return back to that scripture wherefore remember that ye being in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcised by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands so he says now remember you used to be called uncircumcised by the circumcised so that's how they referred to you uncircumcised unclean you know not the children of god because the children of god were marked by this circumcision made by hands and this was he said he says so you were called uncircumcised by by that which is called circumcision in flesh made by hands that at the time ye were without christ being alienated from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world so you've got the viewpoint now this is a beautiful chapter in the scripture you know if you only read it from the eyes of the gentile then you kind of skim through it but when you understand there's this whole other group of people that's saying you're uncircumcised you're unclean you're not holy you're without what promise we're the children of promise we know what we believe and and you're just gentiles you're you're you have no hope you know there's no way for you to be saved you there's no hope for you because you were you were have you were strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who were sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of christ hallelujah so now he's saying okay you used to be without it but there's something that came up come it was a circumcision of the heart and not of the flesh it came by the blood of jesus christ now brought you into the same covenant the same promise the same hope amen so beautiful now that by the blood of christ for he is our peace who who who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us so now he's talking about both sides are a little standoffish the gentiles received christ the jews still had their way now paul's saying now this is a big part of of of the christian walk that we're fixing to come into that's extremely important and i feel led to preach friday night service in missouri out of the message total deliverance it's an older message but it's really fantastic how brother branham preaches that the advancement of the church has to come in unity and so and he says but he hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us okay having made both one so he's made the circumcision and the uncircumcision both won two opposites two things that were that saw no hope and no promise in one another so there's a great work that is established in in the lord now this same work is is uh uh going on within us uh the reconciliation of our spirit and flesh i know that i will let that out there but i had a great visit with it today at lunch and so this great reconciliation having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinance for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace so in other words the gentile and the jew had access to the same forgiveness the same blood the same unity now he's bringing this into unity and making peace between the gentile and the jew making of them one one accord one purpose even taking away abolishing in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments so the enmity is the differences between the two anyway and and hath he and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and come and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh have you ever read the chapter like this you know what i mean seeing it come right down the two sides there the fuss the argument and what paul's trying to say because he's trying to bring them the revelation of the unity that god's creating in them bringing them together because it's the same unity that's coming to us bringing our spirits and our flesh back together so uh it came in the 18th verse for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father oh what equal ground no big eyes no little ewes no holy rabbi no ordinances that got you closer to god now he broke all that down and established a new a new meeting place the shed blood god he's a new provided place of worship that comes right up in our series here a new provided place of worship for through him we both have access circumcised uncircumcised uh law jew and gentile we both have access and by one spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners you were once strangers right alienated from the promise but you're no more foreign or strangers okay oh i wish wouldn't you love to come to the spot where you we didn't feel foreign and alienated from the things that god's doing because of our flesh anyway i i love this this is just great i like reading the scriptures i hope you do too hope i'm not boring you you probably already have known all this but i like to fellowship with it now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto the holy temple in the lord now you you see here what he's saying he says they they both have to come together they both have to be framed together they both have to come under the headship of the lord they they they they they the building is is fitly framed together uh framed together groweth together unto the holy temple of the lord in whom ye also are are built build together for an inhabitation of god through the spirit now as we were uh paul's talking here he's talking about this great because you understand he's the messenger right i know we never look at paul the same way sometimes that we look at our messenger but we we sit down and we read these books right and and we listen to the tapes and we're always going wow wow wow this is unbelievable i see the picture is it unfolds now can you imagine paul is the messenger to the gentiles so now he's bringing the mystery of the gospel of the lord to the gentiles so now he's going out revealing to the gentiles revealing to the jews this plan of god of fitting and joining the gentiles together and building a habitation for the lord for the spirit of the lord that this this great revelation of the plan of god uh unfolding and paul's talking hey these gentiles have to come in they have to be a part it's not going to be the jewish church and the gentile church it's going to be one church put together for the glory of god for the inhabitation of god and and so we we begin to realize that within within the gentiles and within the a jews part of the great mysterious plan of god is hid okay in our day part of the great mysterious plan of god is hid in you okay so we we look back and we saw here in the 10th verse is paul's building up and talking and saying hey you are you are his workmanship so he's telling them being gentiles that you're part of the plan of god the workmanship of god you're part of this do you have a part in this you have a place to play in it because he's going to take these two things fit them and join them together and and make it a habitation for god and and so now he says so he's telling me he says he says uh for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them and so he has to unveil you see we had the opening of the seven seals right and after the opening of the seven seals the the seven mysterious of mysteries that hid the plan of god now come into full view so we can we can we start to see now that there there just like there was a coming together of the of the gentile and the jew there's there's coming together of a a of a theophany body and a a redeemed glorified body there's another union taking place right there's a union an invisible union taking place up between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and so in this part part of that lies within you okay so he has to unveil you or open you up so that plans in there you know what i mean brother when we play this little part of the quote he makes a a a statement about the spirit tearing you out okay so so he he so you're living your life and now you're part of this plan so he's got to find you right he goes out and he he preaches the gospel of peace he pulls you in from the highways and the byways and from the world and now he goes to opening you up amen so hit that that he's got to open you up right and he's got to bring out the before ordained works okay they're in there okay the four ordained works see i just want to fly to missouri right now and get it over with because once i preach something i just want to keep moving on so i'm not i'm trying to let you know because you're my friends but i don't want to give enough in case anybody's you know what i'm trying to say anyway so you kind of read between the lines right but so but he's got to open you up right because because those works are in there so he's he's got to he's got to bring out the before ordained works that we are to walk in and manifest so they're there they're hitting you they're that plan is there it and so a lot of times we think of the opening of the seals and the opening of of these things and we look at it way too much through an intellectual uh theological uh doctrinal uh academic teaching but really it it's a reality of the of god fulfilling out his plan and the the part that you play in that great plan and so when we listen to this little part of uh who is this malkesadek we we begin to see how this how this uh that what's transpiring within us is individuals because a lot of times we question well you know what's going on with me you know well if someone's opening you up and starting to discard the things that aren't part of the plan you know it's not your salvation he said that that we could grow together so this spirit man has got to have a vehicle of manifestation so there's got to be some place in our walk that there's a reconciliation between our spirit man and our flesh man not that we love the flesh man you know what i mean but we know why we have to bring him under subjection we know why that he gave us the flesh man he we understand why that we came the way we come remember and that's the part of the whole plan that we're talking about in melchizedek he explains melchizedek he explains the theophany body and you go wow that's wonderful he says but you had to bypass it come on i thought i had something going here for a little while i'm reading these pages and i'm ready to step out and he says but you had to bypass it because god has got this great thing so part of the mystery of maltese adapt is the reconciliation of our flesh and our spirit breaking down the enmity between the two because that's what the law did right it governed every all the things that are in the flesh but through christ jesus so you can understand why you were born to sinner you know but how that he found you and how nothing's laid to the charge of god's elect and all those things that we talk but that's to bring you to a place okay that we can grow to where we don't let the flesh stand in between the works that were for ordained to do now i just gave you a whole bunch of stuff but i mean and it's good stuff and it's just going to take a long time to go through it uh billy said uh well when you print the who's this male tease it out in flesh and bring it up there and i said well i'm not going to preach out i just i said what makes you think i'm going to preach out on monkeys he says well it's become your favorite book that's till i start reading the next one you know what i mean amen so so this reconciliation is very thing and so and then i'm going to read this to you and then we'll play this little portion and we won't stay long tonight it says and in in who's this malpisode paragraph 112 he says who is this melchizedek but god now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey and death and where we go after we die the secret of our lives i i i mean that just stops me in my tracks you mean there's a secret in my life right well one of the things the seventh seal does is it reveals what all the mysteries even the mystery of the secret of my life so if he had to open the seven seals he has to do you understand so so i i get unveiled amen so this this uh this redeemed reconciled spirit in word man he has to be unveiled now i just can't help but i love you guys so much you know how that you unveil anything is that spiritual or invisible right it's remember casper the ghost how you guys aren't that old i mean matt i can maybe you shaking your head casper the ghost well casper the coast the ghost is a spirit right but so what they did is they put a little a sheet on them and now he was cast for the ghost because he had a what on him a veil so he's got to and in order to unveil that secret mystery in what that he wants to bring out it has to be veiled in flesh you've got to manifest the attributes through something you understand so he and that's why he says you take this redeemed body this body that he used to go ahead and manifest that inward man and then that body will become glorified we won't go into all those parts but we'll read it but i just want you to to to see hear this unfolding or unveiling or opening of you and why you he can reconcile that with the flesh because he's got to use the flesh to manifest the four ordained works is that simple enough okay so we spend all the time just beating us ourselves down and wanting to get rid of the flesh and it isn't you can't get rid of it until he gets rid of it you understand but he wants to us to bring it under subjection or under the leadership of the holy spirit in other words he wants us to use our flesh as his temple and not for the temple of sin so we just read this 12th verse here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely and may i just jump ahead he's also going to go into here in the next few pages the predestination of the ministry of the son of man or the revisitation of the theophany which means god elohim or god amorphy in our day but he says the stage of the stages now listen as we teach on this closely or teach closely the stages of the eternal purpose i know i just read the same thing but i didn't break it up in two separate thought patterns listen closely as we teach this closely the stages of the eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed notice there are still three stages of perfection just like he redeemed the world the same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages so don't ever think that the one stage is passed on you know that took three stages he actually in your life that every time you have a growth stage and you realize that where you were before is no longer acceptable he has to apply justification okay you were justified in going through that stage now let's move up a little higher he has to apply sanctification getting rid of things right and then he applies manifestation so those three stages are the continual three works that he does in your life all along your journey okay now we we play now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey okay um in the three stages of prediction the same way he redeems his people in three stages now look first is justification like luther preached second sanctification like leslie preached third baptism of the holy ghost is that right three then comes the rapture amen that's that's uh that's good for tonight um because i'm just trying to just wait on the anointing for the meeting and and everything but i i think that's some wonderful nuggets don't you and i think that that was worth coming out tonight for you know just to sit there and see the word and understand that you're you're a you're a seal well you're sealed till the day of your redemption right so when the hour of your redemption comes hand the rapture he's got to open the seal because it's reached its destination and he's using these three stages all the time to perfect you okay he's going to do it so let's just listen to this i don't know might be 10 minutes or so and then i just ask you to pray for me that i can get myself out of the way and i can um share these uh little things that i shared with you tonight through that other message and and then again pray for matthew and uh jackson is there the church is being put in their hands while we're away and then uh pray for billy and i is we try to minister and then all the prayer requests that are up there so lord richly bless you let's just take a few moments and and read this we're going to start i believe on paragraph if you want to pull it up on your tablets or your phones i never thought i'd ever come to the day i'd say that so it must be it must be uh justification or something i i i i don't know i'm fighting that hard but uh you know it's okay just turn your ringers off and turn social media off and uh no i guess that would be social media right if you had it on your phone i don't know but we're gonna start at paragraph uh 90. and and just go to the end of paragraph 125 so god bless you listen close keep those thoughts in mind because god's got a lot of wonderful things to unveil to us god bless you let us notice another prophet one time by the name of samuel he was a great man he taught israel told him he shouldn't have a king he said if i ever said one thing to you in the name of the lord but what come to pass they said no everything you've always said in the name of the lord come to pass he was a prophet and he died about three or four years later the king got in trouble that's before the blood of jesus christ was ever shed he was in paradise and a witch of indras called for somebody to come console saul and when the witch saw him standing up she said i see god raising up out of the earth and after the man had been dead buried and rotted in the grave here he was standing there in that cave with his prophet's robes on i was still a prophet before he said why did you call me out of my rest see you become an enemy to god watch him prophesy tomorrow night but this time you will be with me he was still a prophet though he was gone from this body see he become here and was part of that word amen and he entered from the fleshlight back into the body that had been prepared for him before the foundation of the world he entered into the theophany which was the word you get it that's where all believers go when we turn from hearing then in that form the veil then is lifted you see you are the word also when you enter into there as a little baby as i said a while ago now i noticed praise god for these opening seals is my prayer then know these things now the true revelation of melchizedek comes into view why he was god the word before he became flesh god the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see i had father and mother you did too jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or had no mother jesus had a time he started this man didn't jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life it's a self-saved man all the time i hope god reveals it to you but self same person all the time notice his title king of righteousness now hebrews 7 2 king of righteousness and king of peace he's two kings now watch hebrews 7 2 king of righteousness also the king of peace he's two kings there now since he has come in the flesh and received his body up in revelations 21 16 he's called the king of kings he's all three of them together see king god king theophany king jesus he's the king of kings it's all men it's like soul body and spirit all comes to make one also he is the father which was the first son and holy ghost the spirit king of righteousness the spirit attribute theophany king of of um peace theophany and in flesh he was king of kings same person when the theophany moses seen him exodus 33 2 he was a theophany moses wanted to see god he heard his voice heard him talk to him see him in a bush there was a big pillar of fire and he said who are you i want to know who you are moses said i'll put if you let me see you i would like to see your face he said no man can't see my face he said i'll put my hand over your eyes and i'll pass by and you can see my back but not my face see and when he did it was the back of a man it was theophany then the word that come to moses i am that was the word the word came to moses in the form of a pillar of fire in a burning bush the i am as the word from the theology from the theophany rather excuse me he came to abraham as a man under the oak tree now look at aaron there came a man to abraham three of them and sat down under an oak tree three of them i noticed after he talked to abraham why did he come abraham being the one with the promise and the message of the coming son and also he was god's word prophet that was trusting god's word calling anything contrary as though it wasn't see how perfect the word is the word came to the prophet see there was god in a theophany and the bible said the word comes to the prophet and here was the the word in the theophany now you say was that god abraham said it was he said his name was he called him elohim now genesis 1 you find out in the beginning elohim created the heavens and earth in genesis 18 we find out that abraham called this person that sat there and talked to him and could tell him the secrets of his heart tell him what sarah was thinking behind him abraham said it is elohim is it a theophany form you get it notice after now we find out that he was then in the theophany form he called him lord god elohim now in genesis 18 we find that that is true now notice abraham there was three of them together but when abraham met the three he said my lord but when locked down in sodom two of them went down there and lot saw two of them coming and he said my lords see what was the matter the first place lot was not a prophet right or neither was it the messenger of the hour so he didn't have any revelation of him it's exactly right lot could call him large a dozen of them he could still said lords but no matter how many abraham saw it was still one lord there is god this is the melchizedek notice after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here and type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of christ and after the struggle is over after you got yourself whipped out dance when you partake of christ become part of this being you get it jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him right battle for life and after the battle is over then god gives you of himself that is his true communion the little bread and wafer just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out and become part of god remember at this time the communion had never been instituted not until before the death of jesus christ hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later amen but melchizedek after his child abraham had won the victory melchizedek met him and gave him wine and bread amen showing that after this earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again it'll be the wedding supper amen i will not drink before the vine or eat the fruit until i eat it and drink it with you and you in my father's kingdom is that right notice again melchizedek went to meet abraham before he got back home what a beautiful type here we have melchizedek meeting abraham before he got back home after the battle we meet jesus in the air before we get home that's right ii thessalonians tells us that for we meet him in the air a beautiful type of rebecca meeting isaac in the field in the cool of the day we meet him in the air 2 thessalonians tells us so far we would survive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air perfect all these times therefore the theophany if you have died and entered into that theophany what happens the theophany comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you're here in the air you take the body to meet the theophany there you aren't caught up and go to meet the lord in the air who is this melchizedek but god now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely the stages of of the eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed notice there is still three stages to perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages now look first is justification like luther preached second sanctification like wesley preached third baptism of the holy ghost that's right then comes the rapture now the world how do you redeem the world the first what he did when his sin he washed it off in water baptism that's right then he dropped his blood up on it from the cross and sanctified it and called it his own then what does he do as he tore all the world out of you and renovated the whole thing by the fiery baptism of the holy ghost he also will renovate the world it'll be burnt over with fire and cleanse every germ from millions of miles high everything will be cleaned off and then there is a new heaven and a new earth just like you are a new creature in christ jesus when the holy spirit takes a hold of you hallelujah there you are the whole thing's just as plain as it can be everything's in three the natural births and three what's the first thing happens to the woman having a baby what breaks first water what breaks next blood what's the next process life water blood spirit what happens to the plane rocks what's the first thing stone what's the next possible what's the next shelf then the green comes out of that just the three stages of it it gets to the green that's exactly god vindicates that's always been right god vindicates it to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestination is the only one that's considered in redemption people might be making i think they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back amen is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to its original place hallelujah so it's only to predestinate it will be brought back because others didn't come from there they bring back being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had is thought of what she was only he wanted you to he wanted me to stand the pulpit say he wants you to set the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified state it's matured and brought back again no wonder paul could say when there is filling the block to chop his head off he said oh death where is your stain oh grave where is your victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory amen he said death tell me where you can make me holler grave tell me how you gonna hold me for i am a possessor of eternal life amen amen hallelujah you recognize it death hell brave nothing could hold you and nothing can hurt us got eternal life he realized he was blessed with eternal life just like a little dewdrop if i understand it i don't know too much about chemistry but it must be that it's the congealing of humidity or atmosphere and when the night gets cold and dark it falls from the heavens and drops up on the ground it fell from somewhere but the next morning before the sun comes up it's laying there the little fella shivering but let's let the sun come up what's he going to shine it's happy why the sun is going to call it right back to where it come from and that's the way with a christian hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of god something in us tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back into that power that's a police a little dew drop he glistens and shines and shouts because he knows he come from up there and that sun's going to draw him right back up again and a man that's an attribute of god lord of god amen knows hallelujah when he come in contact with the son of god he's going to be drawn up from here someday or if i'll be lifted up from the earth i'll draw all you man unto me amen now notice now we see melchizedek and why that mary wasn't his mother that's the reason he called her woman not mother he had no father for he was the father the everlasting father the three and the one he had no mother certainly not he had no father or he was the father as a poet said one time speaking a great compliment unto jesus he said i am the spoke to moses in a burning bush of fire i am the god of abraham the bright morning star i'm alpha omega the beginning from the end i am the whole creation and jesus is the name that's right oh who do you say that i am and whence do they say that i came do you know my father or can you tell his name hallelujah that's the father's name i come in my father's day and you receive me now amen sure he's the same yesterday and and the smell keswick became flesh he revealed himself as son of man when he come as a prophet he come in three names of a son the son of man the son of god the son of david when he was sure on earth he was a man to fulfill the scripture moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like an unto me so he had to come as a prophet he didn't ever say i am the son of god he said i am the son of man do you believe the son of man because that's what he had to testify of because that's what he was now he's come in another son's name son of god the unseen the spirit and when he comes again his son of david is set up on his throne now when he was shared and was made flesh he was called the son of man now how did he make himself known to the world as son of man the prophet that was the appetizer amen do you love the lord isn't that in that something let me just read this statement again to you and uh and and this kind of goes back to it we were talking just a little bit about that rick reconciliation in paragraph 119. just like a little drew drop if i understand it i don't know too much about the chemistry but but it must be that the the congelling of humidity or atmosphere and when the night gets cold and dark it falls from heaven and drops upon the ground it fell from somewhere but the next morning before the sun comes up it's lying there the little fellow shivering okay so we fell right we bypassed and and here we are right and he said in shivering but just let the sun come up and watch it go to shining it's happy why the sun is going to call it back to where it come from you see it's it's reconciled now it's shivering it's cold it's down here it doesn't have its identity here that's not where it comes from but now it knows i i fell to earth i bypassed my theophany and now the sun is calling me back from where i came okay so that's why he appears i can't help myself that he appears as in that sun name again as son of man in our day because that's the son that calls us back okay that's what it's doing what's he doing do you understand how this message starts to reconcile you coming in the flesh and breaks down the enmity that you have between your spirit and your flesh oh church hallelujah yeah i'm a sinner okay yeah i'm a mess yeah i'm messed up but blessed be to god he planned it that way and then he forgave me and he put my name on the lamb's book of life he says now that's the way it is with the christian hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of god there's something in us telling us that we come from somewhere and we're going back again by the power that's upholding us that's why only the predestinated can be redeemed because they're the only ones that recognize the pull of the son of man ministry and anyway amen if you just can't preach at all in one sermon but i i hope you're glad you came out to the house of the lord and i will let brother billy come and lead us in a song of worship and and uh
