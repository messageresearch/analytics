gathered to see thee and you know the needs of each and every one your bible tells us that you know them even before we ask them and so we pray may you minister to each and divide the word as you see fit and he said it won't return unto you void but may it accomplish that which you intended for it to do today in the name of jesus christ we pray putting all the needs and offerings into your hands

will be well we're just thankful to be here in his presence let's just turn in our bibles to john chapter one it's nice to see so many out to the house have gone pray that the lord would just come and break the bread of life amen and we're just going to read john chapter 1 and such a beautiful chapter um maybe we'll just start at verse 35 it says again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god as i just read that there in the back it struck me you know as as as the disciples received john's message introducing the lamb when you receive the message now you become a carrier of the message and what are we saying in this day behold the lamb we're introducing people none other than to jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus then jesus turned and saw them following and saith in him what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say be an interpreted master where dwelleth thou he saith unto them come and see they came and they saw whether he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour and you'll see that the disciples are going to repeat this jesus told them to come and see and you'll find out when the disciples go to their brothers and go to start witnessing they go they also say the same thing come and see you know you might not always have the the right words or be able to articulate things too well but one thing you can tell your your your friends and you tell your family members and those in the communities come and see and they came and saw where he dwelt in abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peter's brother he first findeth his own brother simon and sayeth unto him we have found the messiah which is being interpreted the christ and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he saith thou art simon the son of jonah thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation of stone the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now philip was of bethesda the city of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael saith in him we have found him of whom moses and the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael sayeth unto him can there be any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith in them behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael sayeth unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wasted under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answered and said unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel and jesus said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee unto the fig tree believeth thou thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man heavenly father we have read your word lord now we're just asking that the interpreter the holy ghost would come lord and that this word would be opened and revealed to your people lord and myself as a man there's nothing that i can do but even in that lord i know by reading the word your people are blessed we pray that you just come break the bread of life now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may have your seats man i just want to fellowship with you a little bit out of that those last couple verses there i wanted to read maybe a little leading up to it just to get the setting but it says jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believeth thou thou shalt see greater things than the these and so i just in the in brother branham in referring to this scripture i just want to read out of a greater than solomon is here he says nathanael being an ordained man to eternal life he said rabbi thou art the son of god the king of israel he said blessed art thou see because i told you this you believe you can see greater things than this see he's ready then to move up into another sphere he'd see greater things that you'll be able to see the angels descending and ascending upon the son of man now because he was coming into higher heights and that's what i want to speak to you for a subject this evening is coming into higher heights and i just even believe it's something that's maybe been voiced in our heart and as fellowshipping with the brothers you know i believe the church and the body were on the cusp of great things i believe we're on the cusp of a unity and a love and such a oneness with our lord and one another looking upon the needs i'm just in great expectation for the things that god is doing amongst us just seeing how people get into action and hearing the testimonies because we're coming into higher heights we're seeing more of his word the promised word being manifested in each one of our lives he says if you that's just accepted christ by justification accept him by sanctification and clean up your life so now the prophet's starting to identify the journey we go through many people come to a place of justification but we don't want to stop at justification he's saying now if you if you believe in jesus christ you that believe now believe him for sanctification and clean up your life you're still smoking watch what happens how much different you look back to justification you who's standing justified and never receiving the baptism of the holy ghost step up into that sphere then look back down at the rest of it see just keep walking till after a while you get so light you could just walk on up in the rapture amen i believe that's what every one of us is doing is we're believing the word of god i meant to greet my my aunt louisa back there it's good to have you amen it's she's always a blessing to us she she comes over to say hi and we're wondering where she is and she's in the laundry doing the laundry you know she comes over to visit and she's such a such a help you know i think we should all have a heart like that looking on the needs and the simple things everybody wants something big great to do sometimes just doing the laundry for somebody going to help clean up their house that's the love of god being shed abroad in your heart we love you amen and uh just coming into higher heights you know we we we that's what we're believing for on this journey and we're all believing for a body change we're all believing to go into a rapture but you know sometimes we make it so complicated sometimes we we just give ourselves into so much thinking about it the prophet i love how he just makes it uh so simple here wherever you're at no matter where you're at in the journey keep looking into the word of god and keep believing for that and god is going to bring you into higher heights as he's telling nathanael here why did he say this because you're you're coming into higher heights and all he said he said nathanael you believe you believe because i told you that i i saw you under a fig tree uh that you believe these things he says oh just stick around a little while and i feel like that with the message oh my you you hear the message and and something your heart is stirred and you believe all that god sent a prophet i say stick around a little while you believe because the message called your name you believe because the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart i say stick around a little bit you believe because of that oh just stick around you're going to come into higher heights there's going to be a greater revelation and a greater manifestation as you feed upon this word of god oh line upon line precept upon precept that word is starting to be materialized in your body you're starting to put on this word you're starting to doing yourself in the modern modest apparel of the word oh wow you're coming into higher heights in jesus christ thou shalt see greater things than this don't stop there don't stop where you're at there's more for you i marvel at how nicodemus came there and he came to him by by night you know and he says uh uh he goes master we know speaking maybe for the the sadducees and the pharisees say we know that thou art a master come from god a teacher come from god because nobody could do these things let's go be with him he had a knowledge of the truth but was he willing to be his disciple was he willing in the face as with our pastors uh uh we we just went through the message ashamed i believe we could maybe say that he was ashamed to be identified with jesus christ because of what what would his uh a church-going friend say what would the people in the neighborhood say here here was a he was a a teacher himself and and maybe a leader amongst the people as jesus would later say and but he he was ashamed to be identified with him the prophet would say that he wasn't willing to have self-denial and renounce the things around him he was ashamed maybe so and and i say how many times are we ashamed to speak up for what we believe when the when the situation presents itself and maybe something in your spirit that vexes you oh you know that can be an opportunity for you to tell somebody about jesus christ to be identified with the word we want to take advantage of those opportunities and and let our light shine that we wouldn't be like this nicodemus who said well we know the message is true we know god sent a prophet and and we have an understanding of it but yet are you taking the message from the prophet and are you living it in such a way where you're following it that you are the message where people can look at your life and know that you're different or are you just kind of blending in like a chameleon and and there's not even really any way to kind of uh differentiate you between your coworkers and the people at school do you kind of just talk about the same things and and kind of just go with the flow this way or that way i wonder if it's because we're ashamed you know when we start to fellowship with somebody or or you start to talk to somebody in business or maybe you're at the store or something and a conversation picks up i'm always looking for where's my spot how can i turn this to jesus christ i'm looking for something to be said and your prophet showed how simple it was you could be talking about the weather you know my can you believe how this cold snap come in and everybody's talking about global warming we've never seen temperatures this cold you know and you can start talking about the end times and and oh how people are all worried and such and a wreck and start to see what their hope is and what they're looking for and you can start to tell them about your hope what your peace is oh were you worried no i really wasn't worried because i knew the lord would take care of me he's always seen me through every time i've had a need every time i've had a trouble and you just start talking about the things of god i believe that's the type of of attitude that we should have that's the kind of stance we should have where we're always looking for an opportunity to say come and see now we can give an answer for the hope of why we're here oh maybe you should ask yourself the question why are you here you're here to be a witness you're here to testify you're here to manifest the message and in that message of shame the prophet starts talking about how it's a calling out time it comes a time that you have to come out and stand for the word we're there it might come at great cost with all the political movements and social justice movements you know i believe many people are so bound by fear if i'm going to speak up or say this amongst my peers you know will the targets be turned on me will i become a a a victim of their justice you know jesus christ was a victim for our justice there was a penalty for sin there was a penalty for all the wrong things that we ever did and god demanded justice for that but he came down he he became like one of us born in a manger that he might be one who could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and he took himself and he had power to lay this life down in power to take it up again for us i say the least we could do is testify of him because he'll see you through just in that text the prophet used mark 8 36 says for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words and this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels and the prophet makes a statement he goes he talks about as our pastor so beautifully brought out you know why would he be ashamed of you prophet says because you're claiming to be his when you won't follow him when you won't follow his word that's why he'll say on that day depart from me you does of iniquity i never knew you oh my i say lord jesus if i'm claiming to believe this message i want to follow this message with all of my heart we're having some fellowship with the brothers and we started talking about iniquity you know iniquity is knowing what to do and not doing it and many times we we think that um you know we we think of iniquity and i know not to do things that are wrong but it's not limited to that iniquity is knowing what to do that can be the right thing that could be you know what the lord's doing with my heart to pray the lord's putting on my heart to call this brother and and we put it off that's iniquity now as as we're we're growing and we're maturing in the words we're not dealing with those ways of the flesh we're not going out in the world we're not drinking and smoking and by god's grace you're cleaning up your life where you're not uh so involved on the internet and you have all the social media accounts and it's just demanding of your time we've we've preached on those things many times but i pray that you're coming to a place where you're shut in with god that you're in a secret place where the world's shut out and you've come in behind the veil in that secret place where you're having communion with him and all the world just seems so far away that you're in that type of fellowship and that type of communion that now as you're walking the footsteps of a righteous one are ordered of the lord footsteps of a good man are ordered of the lord all those those that are the sons of god they're led by the spirit of god i say oh god lead us today lord lead me today who would you have me to witness to lord help me to be the right father and the right husband help me to say the right word tell me to respond in the right way help me to to be a help around my home help me to treat my colleagues and and help me to be a light to those that are in darkness and now you're walking with that heart and with that anticipation and that action comes on you to witness all you're in tune to the spirit say yes lord i'll go there but when we put those things off now we know to do it but we don't do it but now what what what god is wanting to do he's he's fine-tuning us to get into a position where we can be as we've seen a one who came to matured in our day uh uh who would miss an airplane to be obedient to the still small voice who in the face of certain death would speak to him and say go back up the mountain knowing that it would be death to go back up there but he was sensitive to the still small voice i know that's on the gift of a prophet but we have the same calling to be sensitive to the word of god we have the same calling to be sensitive to the still small voice we have the same calling to be led by the holy spirit just as the prophet was led by the angel lord just like the prophet was led by god you are also led by god you are led by the holy spirit don't sell yourself short don't let the devil try to corner you into such a position where you have no say about it and you're just a little lowly and and god's not using you god is using you if you're in the house and you're raising your children and you're washing dishes keep washing dishes for the glory of god you're doing something for the kingdom and you keep looking at how god can use you to minister to your children and minister to your husband and minister and when you go to the grocery store to the delivery man i don't care what it is let your light shine that's your calling and it's a great calling amen we don't want to be found having that type of iniquity where maybe we get like a nicodemus where we know we know the message god sent a prophet i got my wednesday i got my sunday you know i feel pretty good i i got everything right in order you know i i go through my work day i make my money i pay my bills i come to the house of god they make me feel better they predestinate me you know and i i can't miss it for nothing you know and i just i got a good a good religious thing going but you know sometimes if you ain't going through some trials sometimes it's very little rub if the devil ain't after you you've heard it said maybe he got you maybe we're just getting a little too comfortable maybe maybe the reason why things just kind of are flowing so easy go is because you're not doing anything for the kingdom but let's just step out on faith and start doing something for the kingdom of god and watch the devil show up on the scene but that's all right because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world but we want to be sold out oh we we want to we want to believe god with all of our heart we don't want to be ashamed and that message the prophet talks about we don't we don't know the devil no apology you don't know your co-workers no apology uh brother jackson tells uh uh the testimony of a girl he witnessed to and she started cleaning up her life and started uh doing it herself with the message and living right and dressing right and and she came home just just the way she was dressing i believe her her dad told her i would rather see you drunk and passed out than wearing a skirt i mean a dad saying that but her life was convicting him it it it was her own life because she was starting to feed upon the word and the word was starting to have an effect on when the word starts to have an effect on you it starts to have effect on those around you just start feeding on the word take take it beyond just a hearer of the word but a doer of the word and watch that word start having an effect on the people around you you're going to apologize to him just because you're living the word how many times have you just being who you are people think you're being judgmental i haven't even said nothing what are you talking about what do you mean i'm just being judgmental you don't have to apologize about that jesus christ didn't apologize he didn't come and apologize for being the word made flesh but no when they took offense with what he said he says does that offend you lest you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me oh they're with the multitude they went to thousands like we can't handle this he didn't say i'm sorry i'm sorry god sent a prophet you know i'm i'm sorry this is the light of the hour and the scripture says as you walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ shall cleanse you from all your sins and start to tell them about all the religious systems and everything they're a part of and that demons can travel in the name of the father son and holy ghost not the name the lord jesus christ but in titles he didn't apologize for it no he said does that offend you what about when you see the son of man ascending up from what he came unless you start manifesting the word oh that's i mean it's going to happen social justices and and people and neighbors and all that you keep manifesting this word you're going to be offended somebody but you don't need to apologize for it well we need to apologizes to him for not being a proper ambassador for not being a proper representation for allowing iniquity to rise up in our lives where we let the things of god go by so often be faithful in the little things god help us help me lord to be faithful in the little things we want to see all the big things we we want to see manifestations of big things in our life but we got to be faithful with the little things how many times we say it over and over about starting the day out right putting one foot on the bed saying praise god for another day and get on your knees and go to a prayer but what happens that cares of lives and demands all of a sudden something starts to take that place one thing leads to another that's iniquity because we know to give him the first place we know to seek him first the scripture says seek ye seek him early and you shall find him oh so many blessings and so many things that have been given to us but we're letting the little things fall out the wayside we're letting the little foxes that spoil the vine but oh let's not allow that iniquity to start adding up in our life let's get right with him say you know lord it might be just a wednesday night but that's right i remember what it was like when i got out the revival meetings i remember what it was like when i got out of camp i remember what it was like when i traveled down to the men's meeting i knew what it was like when i had that fire burning on the inside of me and i just felt like i'd come into a higher height but you know i've gotten a little complacent now i i feel like i'm not even expecting when i go to the house of god oh how many times we can be rightfully so we we get uh so an expectation when we're having special service we get so an expectation of when we're going to the house of god and maybe it's a minister you have confidence in oh there's such an expectation you come expecting to receive something from the lord i say oh can't we wake up in the morning and have that type of expectation to know that we've entered into a love relationship with none other than jesus christ and know that we can speak to him and commune within the scripture says pray without ceasing oh god let that be manifested in our lives that we can pray without ceasing that we could have such a communion oh just think of it have you ever met a little child that had an invisible friend and they're just talking to him oh my no me and sam we're going to go over here we're going to do who are you talking to maybe we ought to just get so fanatical maybe we ought to just start praying so often without seeing some people like who are you talking i'm talking to the lord not ashamed i can introduce you to him you got an invisible friend well yep you might not see him but the scripture says if you are born again oh that's the way you can see the kingdom of god look people think you're a fruitcake they think you're a nut because they can't see the things you see but blessed are your eyes that you can see these things because you are born again and you can see the kingdom of god oh let's get to a place where we're praying without ceasing that way when the emergency call comes that way when the need comes does anybody know somebody that's a prayer warrior i know a prayer warrior i'm gonna tell a little story on sister genie so many times in the early years there in the church we'd be in the church we'd stay after an old sister genie she just she'd be praying she'd just pull me right in the presence of god she'd just be praying and praying or fervently praying oh it taught me something and i'd like to get i like to give her a little a rose and let her know she's been such an example to me and i've seen a fervent prayer and i've seen such an example and it's courage me that oh we can live in such a place and such a communion that we can change the atmosphere in the room that we can even pull our brothers and sisters that are around us that are having a hard time and they're not breaking through to the presence although we're at such a channel we can be saying all right brothers all right sisters let's go let's go i'ma start doing my part i'm gonna start worshiping in the service it starts in the pre-service you know you ever go watch a football game or you you imagine if the guys woke up and put on their pads and ran out on the on the field you talk about a wreck the people would be running everywhere would be the athletic trainers and the doctors because everybody would be erect they'd all be broke and pulled this hamstring and broke this and broke that hey i kind of feel like that you know pre-service just get our mind right create an atmosphere say lord we're doing spiritual battle i got brothers and sisters that are coming in here that are in bondage they have broken hearts they need answers lord and i'm here i'm here to lay it all on the altar lord and start to to call upon you to come on down and create such an atmosphere here all that when they break through those doors there's just a change in the atmosphere oh it just feels a little bit different feels a little bit different before what what's happening there's people that are preparing to do spiritual warfare and then all the song leader comes up and and the musicians that have already struck the chord and there's a unity now and the body starts marching forward onward christian soldiers marching on the war oh doom devils are on the run you start praising jesus what happens jesus comes near and then your brothers and your sisters are maybe down in a funk or they're down in a valley oh you can reach down and pull them up into the presence of god and get them the victory get in such an atmosphere that when the word starts coming forth we're not just wondering if we you know shut off the coffee pot and did i send out that email we get halfway through the service hardly getting anything out of it no faithful in the little things start taking advantage of our opportunities start knowing that god is with us god is here and he means business would god do we do we believe that jesus christ is here when he comes on the scene he come to do something so you can even start forming that in your heart of your need now what you're battling now what you're going through jesus christ has come he's come here to speak to your need we don't know apology to the devil we don't owe an apology to the world we don't know oh apology the deacons oh you're holding order in the church you don't know an apology you keep staying at your poster do your job that's what you're here for god bless you you don't have to i apologize i know people get their feelings hurt and we have to do the best we can to let them know the way we do but you don't have to apologize let's keep uh oppressing the battle manifesting this word paul says for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth just think of that not ashamed of the gospel to think that our brothers and sisters they were stoned fed the lions they were sold asunder they were crucified they were burnt at the stakes whom the world wasn't even worthy of maybe they'd be with their family out there in the arena maybe say in the words of their lord and savior greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world say daddy i don't understand i don't understand either sweetheart but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world oh it looked like foolishness it looked like weakness to the world but what a strength to be able to believe god in the face of death to be able to take god at his word in the face of all the testimonies of the doctor saying you're sick and there's no way you're ever going to be different i remember just here recently god bless our brother john bill who starting the journey of mourning the loss of a mourning and the loss of his wife and we were there up there for the funeral and we were sitting around at the table and we had we had fervently prayed and that god would heal her and take her out of the bed and we're believers that's what we do and the lord saw fit to take sister donna home and we were there just after the viewing we went out to get a bite to eat we were sitting there and he battles a little uh varticulitis or something like that and i just heard his son saying dad should you go to the hospital and i thought oh my are you okay he's like i'm gonna be all right i'm gonna be all right and i said would you like me to pray for you he says yes i'd like you to pray for me and as i got up to go pray for him there that little devil was like you're gonna go pray for a man who you've all been praying for his wife and and it wasn't the outcome you were looking for but i thought you know god bless you brother john being a testament he didn't change his attitude towards the word it didn't change his stand for the gospel but he said yes brother matthew pray for me because prayer changes things that's what a real believer does in the face of death in the face of all adversary it doesn't matter what it is you're going to stand upon the word because it's the truth no matter what the outcome is he said i am the lord i heal all of your diseases by his stripes we are healed that's thus saith the lord and heavens and earth we'll pass away but that word will never pass away well that's what we do as believers we believe just thinking of those precious brothers and sisters who laid down their lives in the face of death cleaving to god's word and i wonder maybe many times we feel like that in our own lives we're believing for a promise we're looking for an answer and we're wondering lord why am i not seeing the results lord why am i not seeing your promised word being manifested in my life you believe you know you believe the devil can't shake you from that but you just can't you're just wondering what's going on when is it ever going to happen when is this promised lord how is that ever happened for me you know you're in good company because king david was in a straight one time you know god had called him from the sheepfold just the the readiest of the boys there out tended to sheep and god had called him and he had anointed him and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he was to be king but you know it didn't go exactly like david would have thought if it wasn't before long here david was he was held up in some caves and here his own king saul is after him the guy that he had blessed with his songs and created an atmosphere for and and was trying to help me be a help to him and and bless him and now his own kings after his life and the philistines are on the other end they're chasing him down his own home bethlehem is is now under siege oh yeah you're king what kind of king are you david you king of the cave you know how many subjects do you got over here you got a few hundred guys you've got a few outcasts that are following you around some type of king you are you could see how david had received a promise but there in the midst of that word being manifested in him he was going through valleys he was going through a time of uncertainty but just thinking of those those men that were with david what i love about that as the prophet alludes to he said that those men knew who was going to be king he knew that they knew that the anointing was on king david so they knew as long as they were with king david they were going to be in the kingdom and i say as long as you have jesus christ in your heart it doesn't matter what goals or what comes as long as you have him with you it doesn't matter where you are you might feel like you're kicked way back in a cave you might feel like you're kicked back to this side but just like those men they knew that they were with the king and as long as you know you're with jesus christ the prophet of god would say we know who is going to be king does it matter who is going to be president i know who's going to be king he will be king and i know it takes something to stand but god help me to shut my eyes to the denominations and everything else and look to the spiritual sight yonder that is the coming king i'll serve him if it's death let me die if it's my family it's my loved ones if it's my denomination it's everything let me serve him this is the attitude that our brothers and sisters had when they went into those arenas when they were burned at the stake they weren't ashamed if it's death lord if it's in your name i'll go to the stake families of six and eight ten women with children being pulled from their bellies knowing that if they profess the name of jesus christ it would be their death are we ashamed are we embarrassed would you go into that arena will you testify will you start letting your light shine will you kids at school you young men and young women go to the colleges now and realize that that's your your your betting ground one planteth one water but god gives the increase start seeing a revival at the high schools why not a revival in elementary school if he's going to do it it's going to be through you i'll say to him that's the warriors of god like it was with david that had their hands on their sword walking anytime they had their hands on their sword walking anytime that's the way god's warriors walk ready i want to walk ready amen i say keep coming to church keep doing the things you know to do keep following after the word of god keep having people over for dinner keep doing the things that you know to do keep walking with god what did the prophet say you keep walking and you get so light that you could walk up into a rapture what did he not do he walked with god and he was not i say just keep walking keep washing the dishes keep doing the laundry enoch keep going to work and testify in enoch keep doing the things that you're already doing brad in one of these days one of these days you're going to be not you're going to be gone you're going to be out of here and it's in those little things that god is accomplishing great things just in reading that text he said verily verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man just walk until you get so light you could just walk up in the rapture i love this portion of scripture because here jesus is referring to jacob's ladder in genesis 28. this phrase that you'll find out it is seeing angels descending and ascending upon the son of man if you go into genesis chapter 28 you'll find that here uh jacob isaac had called jacob but he said now jacob i want you to go get a wife but i don't i don't want you to take a wife like esau did of these canaanites he didn't want jacob to take a wife like his denominational brother did mixing the word of god and his wives that he took were a vexation to his soul and to his wife and so he said look don't take your wife of one of these but i want you to go down and take a wife of the house of laban your uncle and so jacob now he's following what his father has asked him to do and now he's he's moving out and going towards that land he's going to go find himself a wife and on his way down there he's going to to camp out and just so happens that night he grabs a a stone and he's going to lay down for the evening and he makes a a stone his pillow and jacob has a dream and he starts to have this dream and he and it says that he dreamed and behold a ladder was set up on earth genesis 28 verse 12 and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and when he had woken out of that place oh he just said oh this is a dreadful place this is a fearful place eddie he he he got some oil and he anointed the stone there and he called that place bethel which means house of god and i just thought oh how amazing it is here jesus christ just standing before nathanael saying oh i believe you believed because i i knew that you were under the fig tree but greater things than this will you see and here now the house of god jesus christ the word made flesh is standing there telling nathanael these things that he's going to be taking him into higher heights and now here jacob is in this in this dream he's anointing the stone and say oh this is like the house of god god spoke to me god came down and he confirmed the promise that he gave to my dad he confirmed the promise that he gave to my grandpa and i say if you have been grown up in this message and you've been believing this message i say you pray and have god come down and confirm this promised word to you personally don't take no second-hand revelation get it for yourself the prophet said oh you you're ashamed because you don't know what you're talking about you need to know what you're talking about meet him one time and you'll know what you're talking about so now jacob's going to continue on and he goes out to his until laban and a lot transpires there he gets married and now he's he's leaving with his two wives and children because he really you know he was a shyster and he pulled a fast one over on his father-in-law and robbed him of all of his cattle and so now he's going back home you know and he's going to find himself maybe in a a in a a squeeze like david was he starts going home and now all of a sudden laban and all his workers and servants they're all coming after him on one side and now he's getting closer to home he's like well you know you saw really don't like me either and 400 of esau's men come up on one side and camp on one side now jacob's like all right i'm doomed what am i going to do let's see jacob got desperate in it interesting how god could make promises to us but we let him so easily slip he gives us promises that he'll never leave you nor forsake you he said all my peace i give unto you come unto me all ye who are heavy laden and i will give you rest so how often how easy it is we let those promises slip so that when the cares of life and maybe challenges and things arise we we get all worked up here jacob is he he starts to get desperate he starts to call on the name of the lord and there he wrestled with a man i believe that's where a lot of us need to get to we need to wrestle it out with the angel of the lord because it was in that place it was in that place where jacob wrestled it out there with god he got the blessing he said i won't let you go till you bless me we're a blessed people i can't think of a people on the face of this earth that are more blessed than you god has blessed us he's blessed us with a message he's blessed us with his promises and i want to read this out of isaiah 43 he says but now thus saith the lord that created the o jacob and he that formed the o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i want to focus on that word right there when thou passes through anybody ever felt like a stick in the mud like i'm not going anywhere i've been trying and trying and trying but i don't seem like my prayers are are getting higher than the bedroom ceiling i want to encourage you because the scripture here say when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee when thou pass it through look you're going somewhere if i can just encourage you in that regards you're going somewhere you're not here stuck in a rut you're not just here uh uh trying to uh keep it together trying to hold it together he goes no but i have chosen you i have formed you fear not i have redeemed you oh what does it mean to be redeemed it means to be brought back you want to know where you're going you're going back to where you are with him in the very beginning i have redeemed you look when you when you plant a seed into the ground how do you know what that seed is going to look like well if you got it from an apple tree you get a seed from an apple you know what that seed is going to produce you're going to get apples so maybe we can just read a scripture here and really encourage you but the scripture says in galatians 3 16 it says now abraham now to abraham and his seed were the promised maid he saith not into seeds as of many but as of one seed and thy seed which is christ now that was the promisee which was jesus christ and in john the promisee christ says john 12 24 he says verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now what is the fruit he's talking about you are his offspring jesus christ the original seed except he would die and go in the ground he would abide alone but because of that now he's bringing forth sons and daughters of god where does the fruit come from it comes from the seed where does the word come from where does the seed come from comes from the word and the spoken word is the original seed so where did you come from where were you in the very beginning you were in the mind of god and that's why the prophet would stand there and say you literally are the spoken word seed bride that's who you are where did you come from you came from the seed where did the seed come on the seed came from the word and the spoken word is the original seed that's where you came from you are those literal spoken word seed bride you are the fruit of the original seed the very offspring of god and if god has a son he's a god son he's a a miniature jehovah the prophet says redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood brought back his own he brought back this he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always worship i love this you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep why the devil hates that one you mean i didn't have nothing to do with it no you always were a son or daughter of god you weren't you weren't a sinner or a non-son of god who happened to one day say i'll take you up on the offer you always were a son he said you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in species now we're talking about the original seed jesus christ then what he was you are there's no change in specie as we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in the flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of god we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me oh my father i am returning to thee i say maybe that's what some of us just need to do here we just need to repent we need to say oh lord jesus forgive me save me o my father i have found myself in places that i never should have been i have found myself doing things that i never should have done but now o lord i am calling upon your name and i am returning to thee oh that's all it takes it's for his son just think of this now we just read that scripture in isaiah 43 thus saith the lord that created thee he that formed thee o zion o bride put your name in there go on and put your name in there brother jackson put your name in there brother banks go ahead and put your name in there say oh thus saith the lord that created thee he that formed me o zion oh matthew oh jackson o banks fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine so when thou through the waters when you go through the trials and the tribulations when you go through the time of lost loved ones when you go through the time of being broken up when you go through the time of that one who you are interested in and he's you started to give your emotions and your time to it and you just thought they might be the one for you and it seems all sudden it's broke up and you're all hurt you don't know what you're going to do with your life oh he's with you remember you're passing through now he's not going to leave you in that condition but he said i will be with you because he's bringing you through your trials he's bringing you through your tribulations and i want to say it's not so much about where you were or what you're being brought through but i want to say it's all about where you're going oh some of us can identify some of us were in jail some of us might have been in the crack house some of us might have been doing drugs out on the street some of us might have been in a religious system some of us might have been in the catholic church some of us might have been called out of pentecost some of us might have been called out of the ballrooms i want to say it's it's not so much and we praise god for every testimony because he shows us his grace he shows us his mercy how that loving hand can reach down to the lowest steps oh i can save a sinner such as i but we might not all have in common of the place he reached down and got us out naturally now spiritually we all can relate we are all born in sin we all needed a savior and god rich and mercy within that great love wherein he loved us oh we have that all in common but i know it might not be able to have the same testimony that you have am i not being in the places that you've been i might not have been able to identify with that but one thing we can identify with i might not come from where you came from but we're all going to the same place you know you look on a map and it says you are here that's what the word of god does is it shows you where you're living sometimes we just need to know where we're living as we read that opening quote if you're living under justification there's more for you you're living under sanctification there's more for you we don't look down if you have something you need to make right if you need to confess your faults one to another if you've been living under bondage if you've been living you watched the power of god you you exposed that devil i said you this is the word about you confess your faults one to another you expose that devil that's been keeping you in bondage and you take god at his word by the laying on the hands and by prayer you watch you be delivered are you ashamed of that though see that's what holds us so many times we're ashamed to take god at his word and we'll stay in the conditions that we're in but no let's we're not looking down on anybody oh we're all wretched sinners saved by grace you can come up to me and confess the most worst uh a thing that was ever fathomable but oh we're all looking through the eyes of the blood said oh brother if that's where you're at let's get you delivered as long as you're living defeated it's not helping the body get delivered so you can be in the game oh we're going somewhere we can stand and say i came from god but i'm going back to god we'll find a place to wind this down we'll just ask the musicians to come i love this quote out of the countdown says we've come to the age of astronauts we've moved out of the airplane age we've got more power now the astronaut age has come in what is it we've come into a spiritual age of astronauts going above it's the same spirit only more power only lifting higher can go higher see more believe more be more like christ lifting higher look you got complexes let's lift higher you're in bondage let's lift higher if you've got odd in your heart if you've got a root of bitterness come on saints let's rise above it this is the age of astronauts spiritual astronauts where we're moving up above all the things of the world not the automobile not the horse and buggy maybe set your wings to the winds of faith it's called the eagle age in the bible god calls us prophets eagle age we realize over in the bible we find a malachi 4 that will promise that in the last days now he likens his prophets to eagles he calls himself eagle he's the great jehovah eagle he's able to achieve to himself a bride he's going to in the last days be able to get a bride that the ministry that's so exactly that like a man as a wife has become one and when jehovah gets his people like him it's happening you're coming up higher oh you've believed this far but you're going further jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture oh you realize that you're fulfilling scripture just as jesus christ come to fulfill the old testament and john stood there said behold the lamb of god jesus christ the son of man ministry has come and tabernacled himself and made the word made flesh again and he's saying behold the bride behold my body the word made flesh with a ministry just like mine oh it fulfills the scripture exactly what he said in saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also also fulfills what jesus said would take place as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man now is the astronaut age and the astronaut sees things that the horse rider automobiles or airplanes neither see he goes higher airplanes still down here oh justification is down here let's move up to sanctification sanctification down here let's move up to the gifts and operation down here let's move up into the revealed word the person of jesus christ let's move up higher bouncing around in the clouds and having blowouts and nip downs and everything else but he goes beyond the clouds of creeds and denominations moves on up into the heavens on away from everything the astronaut age we are living in the national age just as sure as god has testified by the natural happenings here so he is testifying now that we've achieved an astronaut god has achieved what he promised he had achieved in the last days according to malachi 4 what did he said i'll send you elijah to restore the faith to return your heart back to the original faith oh the prophet is saying that is being fulfilled why because now there is a literal spoken word seed bride that is here to receive that word and manifest it and that is you oh you're coming into higher heights you are manifesting the word that was spoken these signs shall follow them that believe only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from the airplane and automobiles not look back to what was but more power to lift them higher lift them into the presence of god lift them up where all things are possible who wants to rise up where all things are possible is there somebody here that wants to take god in his word and say you know what i was living right here but i'm ready to come on up a little higher i'm ready to raise on up from justification i'm ready to raise up into sanctification i'm ready to come up from from a sanctified life into the baptism of all yours is there somebody that will stand and say lord i'm going into high heights is there so many that once they take god out of his life and say i'll see that word manifested in me let's stand [Music] well ii peter 1 says for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of god are sinning and descending upon the son of man i want to ask you what do you see when you look at this message what do you see when you look at the message oh i see the son in that ministry performing the messiah's time i see a malachi 4 caught up in a constellation of angels i see angels descending from eternity i see angels coming down to reveal the seven seals i see them coming one by one to malachi 4 in a little room in jeffersonville to tell us what those seven thunders uttered oh hallelujah you can't see the kingdom of god unless you be born again that's what this message has come to do is to open your eyes that you can be born again and center into the kingdom of god oh thank you god hallelujah angels descending and ascending i'll say this in closing romans 8 30 more over whom i did predestinate i love this this is what he did if you believe that's because he

about you hold on to this promise right here you say i believe the message but i'm struggling with cigarettes i believe the message but i'm struggling with pornography i believe the message but i'm struggling with romance books i believe a message but i got all these things in my life i can't get delivered well quit listening all those things you can't get delivered from and listen to the word
