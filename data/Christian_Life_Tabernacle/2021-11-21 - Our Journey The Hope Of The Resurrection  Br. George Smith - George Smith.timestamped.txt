[10:06] five thousand father

[10:41] whatever the pieces are on the people's
[10:43] hearts father
[10:44] though they have issues in their life to
[10:46] be scattered out lord we know that you
[10:48] can gather them together fatherly by the
[10:49] power of your word
[10:51] thank you for your blessings father
[10:54] in jesus christ's name amen
[10:57] [Music]
[11:01] let's open our bibles we're going to do
[11:03] a song reading this morning
[11:05] we have a
[11:06] few brothers that are out i'm sorry
[11:08] david wanted to have it and so he just
[11:10] uh said to jump in
[11:14] we're going to read out of psalm 117
[11:16] this morning and
[11:18] you know i
[11:19] as uh i was just
[11:21] looking over this this few verses in the
[11:24] back
[11:26] you know it really brought to my
[11:27] attention
[11:28] the importance of
[11:30] and the grace and the mercy that we have
[11:32] from the lord by this message
[11:36] and
[11:37] how if we didn't have this message we
[11:39] couldn't see
[11:41] what the truth was
[11:43] and we know that truth is righteousness
[11:45] and so
[11:47] as brother david was even preaching on
[11:49] wednesday night you know sirs we would
[11:50] see jesus
[11:52] if it wasn't for the prophet to come and
[11:54] bring that to us for us to catch the
[11:55] revelation to see who that was
[11:58] we would probably put our own definition
[11:59] on it
[12:00] we would probably just
[12:02] you know interpret it in our own way
[12:04] just like everybody else does outside
[12:06] you know this message
[12:07] and so but we had a voice
[12:09] we had the son of man ministry that came
[12:12] and so when that word was brought forth
[12:14] just like it was in the days of jesus
[12:16] now this this word is being tangible
[12:19] between the bride and she's able to
[12:21] manifest the truth and so as i was
[12:23] reading these two verses is a very short
[12:25] chapter i try to choose a little one but
[12:28] it spoke to me just as i was reading in
[12:29] the back
[12:31] how we have
[12:32] to give them praise for this
[12:35] you know when you find your identity
[12:37] when you find the righteousness and the
[12:39] truth that god reveals to you that's all
[12:40] you can do that's all you want to do and
[12:43] so
[12:44] um
[12:45] we praise them so let's just read
[12:47] chapter 117 of psalms
[12:49] as we just read together o praise the
[12:53] lord all ye nations praise him all ye
[12:56] people for his merciful kindness is
[12:59] great towards us and the truth of the
[13:02] lord endureth forever praise thee lord
[13:06] amen
[13:08] amen
[13:09] god bless you may have your seats
[13:11] i wanted to sing this song this morning

[42:00] a baby dedication this morning and
[42:05] it's uh
[42:06] so
[42:07] jonathan and hope yesterday are going to
[42:10] dedicate their
[42:11] baby jonathan
[42:14] zion so
[42:16] i hope
[42:18] you're here where
[42:20] you come
[42:21] there they are
[42:23] [Music]
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:43] come on right up here
[42:44] [Music]
[42:48] how are you
[42:50] so mary ann's your grandmother and my
[42:53] dad
[42:54] oh
[42:56] hey
[42:57] how are you doing
[42:59] good
[43:00] good
[43:01] now i don't know
[43:04] i don't know if you're the brother that
[43:06] leslie delivered is that right
[43:08] all right so my wife delivered this man
[43:12] stand up
[43:20] so
[43:21] done a good job
[43:25] so
[43:26] uh this is marianne's
[43:29] uh
[43:30] great grandchild
[43:32] and marianne came out of
[43:37] california with us she was in our
[43:39] commune
[43:41] and we were hippies
[43:44] we were christian hippies
[43:48] and
[43:49] and
[43:50] so
[43:51] thus
[43:52] we were trying to leave for
[43:55] out of california and we didn't have a
[43:57] lot of money so we prayed and the lord
[44:02] gave us life
[44:03] and now we're having a baby dedication i
[44:06] hope you're marianne i hope maybe you're
[44:09] listening or this might be recorded but
[44:12] it's hard for me to believe that now
[44:14] we're dedicating the great
[44:17] grandchild so that's wonder a little
[44:19] scripture came on my heart
[44:22] and it it's found in samuel
[44:26] and
[44:28] the 20th chapter in the 41st verse
[44:32] and it says and as soon as the lad was
[44:36] gone
[44:37] no the
[44:39] i'm sorry this is the 42nd verse
[44:41] and jonathan said to david
[44:44] go in peace
[44:47] for as much as we have sworn both of us
[44:52] in the name of the lord saying
[44:56] the lord be between me and thee
[44:59] and between my seed and thy seed forever
[45:03] and he arose and departed and jonathan
[45:06] went into the city
[45:08] the great story of jonathan's testimony
[45:11] is a great testimony of loyalty
[45:15] of love and loyalty and how that
[45:19] jonathan
[45:20] chose to do what was right
[45:23] in the face of all
[45:25] obstacles or all political
[45:30] situations and everything and they bound
[45:34] uh oath
[45:35] together that god
[45:37] would always be between them
[45:40] and so i that's my prayer this morning
[45:42] is that god is always between
[45:45] little
[45:47] zion's life here
[45:51] jonathan zion's life
[45:53] and
[45:54] god will always be between his life
[45:57] and everything that he does so it's just
[46:01] wonderful to
[46:03] have this day and it
[46:05] takes me back that i'm
[46:07] dedicating great grandchildren of people
[46:10] that i know but god's life goes on all
[46:12] the yeskies that are here says yes god
[46:15] bless you and everybody this is just a
[46:17] wonderful time so
[46:19] uh
[46:21] brother once you come up let me ask you
[46:24] yeah come on up

[46:28] wife with you

[49:20] [Music]
[49:24] i think it's wonderful
[49:26] hallelujah
[49:28] hey man you love the lord
[49:32] [Music]
[49:33] amen
[49:35] well it's wonderful to have brother
[49:38] george with us today
[49:40] and
[49:41] we're talking maybe tonight that he
[49:44] could uh
[49:45] preach in spanish and all we've got to
[49:47] do is find an interpreter so
[49:50] we will do it or you know he can
[49:53] preach both in spanish and english at
[49:55] the same time
[49:56] so i don't know what he'll do but
[49:59] i haven't been able to figure him out in
[50:01] all the years that i've known him but
[50:03] the one thing i do know is he loves the
[50:05] word
[50:07] and he loves the scripture and his
[50:09] life's always been a wonderful testimony
[50:11] and he's always tried to
[50:14] share this message everywhere he can so
[50:16] let's stand together this morning
[50:20] let's sing amazing grace
[50:24] as we invite our brother to come and
[50:26] break the word with
[50:28] with
[50:29] us this morning
[50:30] [Music]
[50:32] you know the prophet of god said that in
[50:34] every age god had an allotted word
[50:38] for that aid and so i believe that
[50:42] he doesn't change
[50:44] he's the same yesterday today and
[50:47] forever
[50:48] and once you find his pattern
[50:51] that pattern remains
[50:53] every age every time every situation
[50:57] if anybody approaches them on the same
[51:00] ground
[51:01] they'll get the same result
[51:03] amen so i believe god's got a lot of
[51:05] word for us this morning
[51:08] amen he didn't say how it would come or
[51:12] who would bring it but he's got a lot of
[51:14] work
[51:15] he knows who would be here
[51:17] and what each of us need this morning
[51:20] so as our brother comes to break the
[51:22] word of life to us
[51:24] just remember that god's got something
[51:26] for you
[51:28] but he only comes to them that are
[51:30] looking for him
[51:32] so don't let the word pass you by this
[51:35] morning
[51:37] just listen close and
[51:39] listen for your name
[51:41] and i believe god will bless you this
[51:43] morning let's sing it as our brother
[51:45] comes amazing grace amen
[51:50] [Music]
[51:55] grace
[51:56] [Music]
[52:13] i was
[52:16] [Music]
[52:24] i was
[52:26] [Music]

[53:12] [Music]
[53:17] good morning it's good to be here with
[53:18] you
[53:20] you never know when i might show up
[53:22] but i'm driving through to arizona to be
[53:24] with family for thanksgiving and so we
[53:27] couldn't go
[53:28] can't get arizona without coming through
[53:29] dallas
[53:31] and uh brother david's made me very
[53:33] welcome
[53:34] and it's always good to see all of you
[53:40] spend
[53:44] this morning we're going to speak a
[53:45] subject
[53:47] our journey
[53:48] the hope of the resurrection
[53:51] and i was kind of debating between this
[53:53] and another message and
[53:55] then the quartet got up and sang those
[53:56] songs that just pushed me in the right
[53:58] direction
[54:00] elijah says in the token message
[54:02] preached right here in dallas
[54:03] god's big clock ticks perfect
[54:08] it won't be one minute fast
[54:10] or one minute behind it'll be just
[54:13] exactly on time
[54:15] on schedule and perfectly balanced
[54:18] you can depend on it
[54:20] it's not something we made up it's just
[54:22] truth
[54:23] open your bibles over here to first john
[54:26] it's way over there by revelation
[54:29] yeah some people don't know that
[54:31] first john chapter 2
[54:33] and verse 28.
[54:36] getting close
[54:41] first john chapter 2 and verse 28 and
[54:44] now little children abide in him that
[54:46] when he shall appear
[54:48] we may have confidence and not be
[54:51] ashamed before him at his coming
[54:54] if we know if you know that he is
[54:57] righteous you know that everyone that
[55:00] doeth righteousness is born of him
[55:02] behold what manner of love the father
[55:04] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[55:07] called the sons of god
[55:09] therefore the world knoweth us not
[55:11] because it knew him not
[55:13] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[55:15] it does not yet appear exactly what we
[55:18] shall be but we know that when he shall
[55:20] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[55:23] see him as he is
[55:25] and every man that hath this hope in him
[55:28] purifieth himself even as he is pure
[55:32] let's look at the lord in prayer
[55:34] precious heavenly father we're so
[55:35] thankful to be here
[55:37] in texas one more time we thank you for
[55:39] all those that have made the right
[55:41] choice and come out to the house of the
[55:42] lord and many who are
[55:44] wanting to be here but maybe for
[55:46] different circumstances have to
[55:48] be watching over the screen and pray
[55:51] that you bless them
[55:52] anoint them lord wherever they are may
[55:54] your word go forth and be a blessing to
[55:56] every person that's listening
[55:58] we thank you for your word we thank you
[56:00] for a true word of prophecy that we have
[56:02] that we can follow we can step into it
[56:04] with confidence
[56:05] help us now in jesus name amen
[56:08] you may be seated
[56:16] now all through scripture
[56:18] you find things like in the year of
[56:20] jubilee
[56:21] in the year that a certain king died
[56:24] in the month in the day
[56:26] sometimes very specific dates
[56:29] other things we don't know what date
[56:33] but
[56:33] we're only here to remind you of what a
[56:35] prophet has said and we're going to
[56:36] quote from different prophets so don't
[56:38] get too excited here we got it all
[56:40] together all you do is pay attention
[56:42] and so um on earth we live by a calendar
[56:46] we live by a clock we we have certain
[56:48] things we have to meet that'd be a
[56:50] certain place a certain time
[56:52] and um everything that ever has been
[56:55] you know
[56:56] everything that is and everything that
[56:58] will be is governed by the word of god
[57:02] now we forgot what we were doing at noon
[57:04] friday we don't know where we were six
[57:06] o'clock saturday morning that's all
[57:08] passed it doesn't matter you can't
[57:09] change that
[57:10] and we're here to prepare for
[57:12] whatever is coming
[57:14] because we don't know that either we
[57:15] have plans
[57:17] but we're living now
[57:19] so don't worry about those past don't
[57:21] worry about the future we're living now
[57:24] and so god's word comes to us by word of
[57:26] prophecy because god spoke he speaks the
[57:28] prophets
[57:29] and
[57:30] this that we call the holy bible is our
[57:33] roadmap
[57:34] okay
[57:35] it's our book of instruction our book of
[57:36] directions
[57:38] and some of you that are as old as i am
[57:40] uh
[57:41] yeah i'm older than the pastor in case
[57:42] you didn't know but
[57:44] um
[57:45] we used to have a map book you know and
[57:48] had all the states in there so if you're
[57:50] going to california from here
[57:52] it wasn't just the next one after texas
[57:54] it's alphabetical order so you had to
[57:56] flip through the book and find your way
[57:57] to get there
[57:59] let's see we've got that solvent that we
[58:01] have a different way
[58:03] and so
[58:04] um
[58:05] god has sent us a vindicated prophet to
[58:08] make the way clear
[58:10] you see modern events made clear by
[58:12] prophecy
[58:14] and so here we are
[58:16] in in 2021 going into
[58:18] 2022 who would ever guess that i can
[58:22] remember when i thought wow we ever get
[58:24] to the year 2000
[58:26] wow that'll be a real
[58:28] real change well that's history
[58:30] there's some of you here weren't even
[58:32] born in 2000 you know
[58:34] and so
[58:35] we can't go back we can't go to the
[58:36] sides we've got to go forward because
[58:38] the clock is ticking it's ticking
[58:41] all these cute little girls they grow up
[58:44] and then they leave home you know
[58:46] cute doesn't last forever but you know
[58:49] on some people
[58:52] but everything we do is time sensitive
[58:54] right
[58:56] yeah it's time sensitive you know that
[58:57] the restaurant is open and i promise to
[58:59] let you out before lunch but everything
[59:02] is time sensitive
[59:03] so
[59:04] as the tick as the clock ticks by
[59:08] we need to make serious preparations for
[59:10] this journey okay
[59:13] the scripture says in revelations 19 7
[59:15] that the bride has made herself ready
[59:18] she's not sitting on the porch waiting
[59:20] for the check she's busy doing things
[59:23] get up early go to bed late you get
[59:25] things done you know
[59:27] and to get ready there's four things you
[59:29] want to keep in mind
[59:31] and these are all things that that even
[59:33] you can do yeah
[59:35] everybody can do certain today
[59:37] and
[59:39] to make ready
[59:40] one is that you read at least one
[59:42] chapter out of your bible
[59:44] now that's not on the phone it's not on
[59:46] the tablet you open your bible and you
[59:48] turn the pages and you read out of your
[59:49] bible
[59:52] it's important
[59:53] you don't just listen to scorpio
[59:54] listening you know you read it
[59:57] number two you read at least one page
[59:59] out of the church age book
[1:00:02] uh-huh
[1:00:03] i still have the challenge out there i
[1:00:05] want to see the first person that's ever
[1:00:07] been hurt by that book in any language
[1:00:11] now there's some detractors out there
[1:00:13] we've got to have them got to have those
[1:00:15] people but if you don't have a church
[1:00:17] age book we'll talk after church
[1:00:20] number three
[1:00:21] you listen to at least 20 minutes of the
[1:00:23] prophet's message
[1:00:24] now every day
[1:00:26] it won't hurt you i mean i've been out
[1:00:28] in this traffic too and that's a great
[1:00:30] time to put on tape listen
[1:00:33] because you screaming isn't going to
[1:00:34] help those people move any faster
[1:00:38] and you can pray at all times
[1:00:41] okay
[1:00:43] and you even pray for those that hate
[1:00:44] you
[1:00:45] yeah
[1:00:46] that's what the word says
[1:00:48] so you want to fulfill the word you want
[1:00:50] to say what he says pray for those that
[1:00:52] hate you
[1:00:53] brother brahm says prayer changes things
[1:00:56] changes death to life
[1:00:59] prayer changes sickness to health
[1:01:02] how many can raise your hand no that's
[1:01:03] true
[1:01:04] yeah see god is alive
[1:01:06] you want to know where the miracles are
[1:01:08] look around
[1:01:09] right here
[1:01:10] and so um
[1:01:12] it changes sinners into saints
[1:01:16] some were out there doing bad things
[1:01:17] here they are
[1:01:19] and you know in relation to that i just
[1:01:22] saw a testimony this morning on my phone
[1:01:24] brother sent me
[1:01:26] you've all heard of mr el chapo right
[1:01:30] he used to be a real bad boy but see in
[1:01:32] god's books sin is sin
[1:01:34] so it's not because somebody was a worse
[1:01:36] sinner no sin is sin but he's come to
[1:01:38] the lord he's believing this message
[1:01:40] and he's in solitary confinement and
[1:01:42] he's not getting out
[1:01:44] and our government is prejudiced because
[1:01:45] they're not letting preacher get in to
[1:01:46] see him
[1:01:48] so this little sidelight
[1:01:50] anyway
[1:01:52] prayer changes sinners to saints
[1:01:54] now you can laugh too much
[1:01:56] and uh you can eat too much you shout
[1:01:58] too much but you can't pray too much
[1:02:02] no it's not possible
[1:02:03] paul says in first timothy 2 8 i will
[1:02:05] therefore that men pray everywhere
[1:02:07] lifting up holy hands without wrath
[1:02:10] without doubting
[1:02:12] so
[1:02:13] um
[1:02:14] we will never be able to pray too much
[1:02:16] so these four items that i've given you
[1:02:19] will bring peace to your home
[1:02:21] it'll settle things you see
[1:02:24] and all you've got to do is stay in tune
[1:02:26] with the heavenly father
[1:02:28] and prepare for rapture
[1:02:30] that's our job you see
[1:02:32] and so today every one of us is on a
[1:02:34] journey okay we're on a journey to the
[1:02:37] gate of the resurrection
[1:02:39] that's our next stop this next thing
[1:02:41] that's going to happen
[1:02:42] and so um
[1:02:46] but there's many distractions along the
[1:02:47] way
[1:02:48] now you all been on these nice highways
[1:02:49] forgot right
[1:02:51] there's all these restaurants and and
[1:02:53] hotels all kinds of things on the way
[1:02:55] but we've got to get there
[1:02:58] see starting tonight i'm going to be
[1:02:59] going towards flagstaff arizona well
[1:03:02] it's 15 hours
[1:03:03] there's a lot of reasons to stop no i'll
[1:03:05] have some munchies and i'll just keep
[1:03:07] going
[1:03:08] but i will stop to rest
[1:03:10] but there's things along the way that
[1:03:12] distract us
[1:03:14] and
[1:03:15] we've got to keep focused
[1:03:18] now like i said we used to have the map
[1:03:19] book and you know hopefully you got
[1:03:21] somebody with you can flip the pages and
[1:03:23] find where you're going well today
[1:03:26] we have the uh the lady that speaks to
[1:03:29] me on the phone
[1:03:31] yeah and guess what she can see through
[1:03:32] the clouds she can see in the dark it's
[1:03:35] amazing
[1:03:37] god's positioning system
[1:03:39] he directed it there's 26 satellites up
[1:03:41] there that can tell everybody how to get
[1:03:42] there and so it's a voice on the on the
[1:03:45] dashboard there
[1:03:47] that
[1:03:48] takes us in the direction we want to go
[1:03:50] and if there's a wreck they'll show me
[1:03:52] how to get around it i mean it's amazing
[1:03:55] now god's word operates the same way you
[1:03:57] see
[1:03:59] so we have a hope of the resurrection
[1:04:01] it's like a magnet it's pulling us there
[1:04:03] and as believers in god's word we come
[1:04:06] from a long line of travelers
[1:04:09] okay
[1:04:12] so
[1:04:14] we have brother abraham for example
[1:04:17] he traveled about 500 miles from haran
[1:04:20] down to hebron
[1:04:22] and his journey was characterized by
[1:04:24] faith
[1:04:25] he had faith because god spoke to him
[1:04:27] he'd never been there
[1:04:28] god directed him he didn't have a cell
[1:04:30] phone but god was directing him
[1:04:33] now eleazar retraced the same 500 miles
[1:04:36] to go back and get rebecca
[1:04:38] it's in your bible in genesis
[1:04:40] and he was accompanied by an angel
[1:04:43] and his journey was characterized by
[1:04:46] success
[1:04:48] then we have many years later we got
[1:04:50] joseph and mary
[1:04:53] and they traveled about 60 miles from
[1:04:55] bethlehem to bethlehem obeying the law
[1:04:58] not getting an exemption not because on
[1:05:01] this no they obey the law
[1:05:03] that's what make this country what it is
[1:05:06] and they travel under difficult
[1:05:07] circumstances
[1:05:09] and so
[1:05:10] they
[1:05:11] they went because it was time for the
[1:05:13] taxation now yes she was very pregnant
[1:05:15] she was only you know nine months
[1:05:16] pregnant and rebecca always said that
[1:05:18] when she got to heaven she was going to
[1:05:20] find mary and ask her mary what on earth
[1:05:23] what are you thinking why didn't you
[1:05:24] take some clothes why don't you take
[1:05:26] some things for this baby you knew you
[1:05:27] was going to have baby you're the first
[1:05:29] one in the world and you had nothing
[1:05:32] you had to get the thing off the rack
[1:05:33] the swaddling cloth and put around him
[1:05:36] so i'm sure she already found her
[1:05:38] but you see
[1:05:39] they traveled under difficult
[1:05:40] circumstances
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:44] god's clock was ticking there's no
[1:05:46] shortcuts there's no excuses and there's
[1:05:48] many more in the bible
[1:05:50] but the most difficult journey was taken
[1:05:52] by jesus christ our lord
[1:05:55] he began
[1:05:56] up in caesarea philippi that's the
[1:05:58] northernmost point that he went
[1:06:01] and
[1:06:02] that's in matthew 16 that you'll find
[1:06:04] that he traveled about a hundred miles
[1:06:06] down to jerusalem you see
[1:06:09] and um
[1:06:11] once he got down there
[1:06:13] he went from the temple in jerusalem
[1:06:14] across the kidron valley over over to
[1:06:17] gethsemane
[1:06:18] okay it's about 600 yards
[1:06:21] and then once he's arrested
[1:06:23] back to the house of caiaphas across the
[1:06:26] valley again about 700 yards
[1:06:29] you just think this is all on foot they
[1:06:31] didn't have no suv
[1:06:33] no they walked
[1:06:35] and
[1:06:36] then over the pilot's judgment hall
[1:06:38] condemned without a proper trial
[1:06:40] and then 500 yards over to calvary
[1:06:43] as a convict
[1:06:45] so all of this less than a mile and a
[1:06:47] half
[1:06:48] and there
[1:06:49] they crucified him
[1:06:52] for you
[1:06:54] no matter where you come from no matter
[1:06:56] who your mom is who your grandfather is
[1:06:58] christ died for you
[1:07:01] okay
[1:07:02] and so
[1:07:03] um
[1:07:04] all of us are the purchase of calvary
[1:07:07] the predestinated seed throughout seven
[1:07:09] ages
[1:07:10] so our journey is today from dark
[1:07:12] laodicea that we live in
[1:07:14] to the gate of the resurrection just
[1:07:16] imagine those doors back there's the
[1:07:17] gate of the resurrection and we're we're
[1:07:19] inching that way
[1:07:20] now there's going to be obstacles but we
[1:07:22] got to get there because there's
[1:07:23] something in here pulling us you see
[1:07:26] and um the question is are you ready
[1:07:30] well we're gonna see about that or do
[1:07:32] you have things that yeah but i gotta
[1:07:33] gotta change my clothes and i gotta put
[1:07:35] my other shoes no we're ready to go
[1:07:38] you gotta go now see
[1:07:40] and so can you endure what's going on
[1:07:43] and uh we do live in dark laodicea now
[1:07:45] the prophet speaks over here and speak
[1:07:47] to the rock 1953. now we're getting
[1:07:50] we're going to talk about a journey
[1:07:54] how that god brought his people out of
[1:07:55] egypt into the promised land a perfect
[1:07:57] type of leaving sin coming into the
[1:08:00] spirit land and there's three stages to
[1:08:02] that journey
[1:08:03] one israel over there in egypt number
[1:08:06] two israel in the journey and three
[1:08:09] israel in palestine
[1:08:11] which is a perfect type of one
[1:08:13] justification by faith coming out
[1:08:16] you know
[1:08:17] good people living in sin but
[1:08:19] god bringing them out
[1:08:20] and then number two sanctification is to
[1:08:22] pass through the blood on our journey
[1:08:24] somewhere and number three the baptism
[1:08:26] the holy ghost or we enter into rest
[1:08:29] any questions so far you pay attention
[1:08:32] okay good
[1:08:34] because i did bring the level
[1:08:38] uh-huh you wonder how it's going to come
[1:08:39] out
[1:08:41] but it's got two purposes one for you to
[1:08:43] watch that i stay level but the other if
[1:08:45] i see anybody
[1:08:47] nodding off
[1:08:54] so he says that's perfectly the three
[1:08:56] stages of the church where this church
[1:08:58] is staged now
[1:09:00] he spoke that a long time ago see the
[1:09:02] church like this one is like a hospital
[1:09:05] everybody's not on the same level
[1:09:07] we've got to have little patience with
[1:09:08] people now it's not the deacon's job or
[1:09:11] the pastor's job or anybody else to
[1:09:13] decide who gets to stay and who gets to
[1:09:15] go
[1:09:16] no it's the holy ghost well speak the
[1:09:19] word
[1:09:21] you didn't know i was going to be here
[1:09:22] you didn't know i didn't know what i was
[1:09:23] going to say but the word will decide
[1:09:25] who gets to stay and get well and be
[1:09:27] raptured and who has to leave
[1:09:30] the word will do that
[1:09:32] so we're here today coming out we're in
[1:09:34] justification others are going through
[1:09:36] the blood you know through the process
[1:09:38] of redemption sanctification others are
[1:09:40] resting in the holy ghost we're in
[1:09:42] different stages of the journey
[1:09:44] but we all form the church of jesus
[1:09:47] christ in our journey from here to the
[1:09:49] gate of the resurrection
[1:09:51] i don't repeat too much but
[1:09:53] if i do it's because somebody's not
[1:09:54] paying attention
[1:09:56] so we're marching forward we're making
[1:09:57] progress now
[1:09:59] a message redemption and completeness
[1:10:02] 1954 now we're moved by the holy ghost
[1:10:06] in going now into the promised land
[1:10:08] quote in my father's house are many
[1:10:09] mansions if it wasn't so i would have
[1:10:11] told you i go now to prepare a place for
[1:10:13] you
[1:10:14] now we have a promised land that we're
[1:10:16] going to
[1:10:17] he promised we're on the way okay
[1:10:20] and each day marks a milestone the clock
[1:10:23] is ticking
[1:10:24] okay
[1:10:26] and um
[1:10:27] he says another day another milestone
[1:10:29] and there's a big dark shadow
[1:10:31] out there before us it's called death
[1:10:34] some have already gone into that rest
[1:10:37] we're still here
[1:10:38] there's a line in the road and nobody
[1:10:40] knows where that line is for you
[1:10:43] but you won't go past that line
[1:10:45] i don't care how much oatmeal you eat
[1:10:46] how much broccoli and how much you stay
[1:10:49] away from chocolate you can't go past
[1:10:51] the line
[1:10:52] it's there
[1:10:53] see
[1:10:54] every time our heart beats we move one
[1:10:57] step closer to that line
[1:10:59] one of these days is going to take its
[1:11:00] last beat we're going in
[1:11:02] i want to be at my time make my lot now
[1:11:05] that's kentucky english for be ready
[1:11:07] okay
[1:11:09] as i hope every one of you is today when
[1:11:11] i know that it's lying there just before
[1:11:13] me and i have to meet it i don't want to
[1:11:15] be a coward
[1:11:16] i want to wrap myself in the robe of his
[1:11:18] righteousness walking into it knowing
[1:11:21] this that i am sure that i know him in
[1:11:23] the power of his resurrection
[1:11:26] that when he calls me from the dead i'll
[1:11:27] be called out with them that's living
[1:11:30] god is god of the living okay
[1:11:33] so for those that are already buried
[1:11:35] that book is closed
[1:11:36] they can't make any more changes but
[1:11:38] we're still here you see
[1:11:40] at another place god hath provide god
[1:11:43] has a provided way 1956 i imagine when
[1:11:46] the ages roll on he will just still be
[1:11:48] getting better and better all the time
[1:11:50] when we look back and see how god has
[1:11:52] brought us out brought us through and
[1:11:54] brought us into the three stages
[1:11:56] he says the christian life is a journey
[1:11:58] yes it's a pilgrimage you see and we're
[1:12:01] just passing through this land and we're
[1:12:04] not going to stay here many times we
[1:12:06] build a house
[1:12:07] and we say well the family you know now
[1:12:09] we can anchor down this is ours it's
[1:12:11] paid for and so forth but for how long
[1:12:14] you don't know
[1:12:15] and we always would like to get to a
[1:12:17] place where we could just say this is
[1:12:19] ours for good
[1:12:20] like secure
[1:12:23] but it isn't here on earth
[1:12:25] that place isn't here
[1:12:27] we don't have such a place but there's
[1:12:29] something in you that calls out for such
[1:12:30] a place and before there could be
[1:12:32] anything in you calling for such a place
[1:12:34] that place has to be in existence or
[1:12:36] there'd be nothing in here to call for
[1:12:38] it
[1:12:39] i mean this is pretty simple english you
[1:12:41] know
[1:12:42] so the deep can't call to the deep
[1:12:44] unless there's a deep to respond
[1:12:47] so it has to be that place first to make
[1:12:49] this deep call for it
[1:12:53] another place communion 1962.
[1:12:57] he's in prayer here he says now we want
[1:12:59] to keep under the blood at all times
[1:13:01] we don't know just what might happen
[1:13:03] all things are about wound up yeah clear
[1:13:06] back in 62. that's coming up a long time
[1:13:08] ago we feel lord that the coming of the
[1:13:10] lord is at hand we're fixing to take a
[1:13:12] journey and as we think of a journey we
[1:13:15] might think of suitcases and extra
[1:13:17] clothing extra shoes but how different
[1:13:20] this journey is
[1:13:21] it's not packing up it's unpacking
[1:13:24] laying aside
[1:13:27] as your great servant paul said in the
[1:13:29] book of hebrews 12th chapter we may lay
[1:13:31] aside every weight of unbelief that so
[1:13:34] easily besets us might run the race with
[1:13:38] patience the race that is set before us
[1:13:40] so don't be accumulating stuff
[1:13:42] give it away have a yard sale we're
[1:13:44] leaving
[1:13:46] so on this journey we have three kinds
[1:13:48] of believers now we don't want to think
[1:13:50] that but you know which kind of
[1:13:52] believers you are i'm not here to judge
[1:13:53] you but you know which one you are
[1:13:56] now if i could be the little fly on the
[1:13:58] wall and listen to your conversation at
[1:14:00] lunch
[1:14:01] then i can figure out which one you are
[1:14:06] but you see the word is preached to all
[1:14:09] evenly we don't discriminate
[1:14:12] and the church is a hospital okay
[1:14:15] so
[1:14:16] the make-believer and the unbeliever
[1:14:18] they're just along temporarily they
[1:14:20] might look like a believer they dress
[1:14:22] right their hair is right and they're
[1:14:24] just here temporarily they're they're
[1:14:26] enjoying the free ride
[1:14:28] soon they will have to jump off
[1:14:31] they can't go the distance you see they
[1:14:33] can't take the pressure they can't take
[1:14:35] the responsibility of the word
[1:14:37] now it's nice to come here a nice
[1:14:39] building can have another one lord
[1:14:40] willing
[1:14:41] and you know it's heated or it's air
[1:14:43] conditioned you're comfortable
[1:14:45] i don't get too comfortable because i
[1:14:47] might slam this down
[1:14:50] but you see
[1:14:53] they don't take they can't take the
[1:14:54] pressure of the word they can't take the
[1:14:56] responsibility of the word that they
[1:14:58] hear every service people just like to
[1:15:00] come here and kind of you know get cozy
[1:15:01] with the crowd and maybe someone will
[1:15:03] even might meet his lunch and on
[1:15:05] i don't know we're here for a reason
[1:15:07] we're here to make ready see
[1:15:09] now these people these make believers
[1:15:11] and unbelievers they look like believers
[1:15:13] and uh they try to act like believers
[1:15:16] impersonators
[1:15:18] and um
[1:15:19] and they can quote the word well they'll
[1:15:21] tell you right now you left off of the
[1:15:23] and you left off the at
[1:15:25] thank you
[1:15:27] wondering if he's going to catch that
[1:15:28] you know
[1:15:29] but they can't live at 100
[1:15:31] it's just it's just in the head you know
[1:15:35] so don't waste your time trying to mark
[1:15:37] people and judge people okay
[1:15:40] god knows whose are his he knows exactly
[1:15:43] who's who and his only you know when we
[1:15:45] get to the wedding supper it's not going
[1:15:47] to be like this where there's some empty
[1:15:48] chairs
[1:15:49] every chair's got somebody in it
[1:15:51] nobody's gonna be standing around the
[1:15:53] wall i wonder where my chair is no no
[1:15:55] it's all taken care of you see
[1:15:57] so he will take care of the separating
[1:15:59] uh he'll take care of giving out their
[1:16:01] rewards he doesn't need your opinions
[1:16:04] he doesn't need the help of our little
[1:16:06] canary brain
[1:16:08] so the believer
[1:16:10] he feeds day and night on the word
[1:16:13] right
[1:16:14] he doesn't just read the one chapter or
[1:16:15] the one page he gets into it you know
[1:16:18] and um uh the believer loves the word
[1:16:22] it's his life source along the way
[1:16:25] and uh he stays in tune he stays in the
[1:16:28] atmosphere and he stays balanced
[1:16:31] when something goes a little bit wrong
[1:16:32] oh got to get back you know
[1:16:35] you're lucky you're all awake it's good
[1:16:40] so the bible says in romans 3 23 all
[1:16:42] have sinned
[1:16:44] that's all the my gary kids all the
[1:16:46] branhams all the smiths
[1:16:49] no aaron
[1:16:51] all the people in lumumbashi everybody
[1:16:53] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:16:55] glory of god so we're not born perfect
[1:16:58] another little baby that was here looks
[1:17:00] perfect
[1:17:01] but the scripture says born in sin comes
[1:17:03] to the world speaking lies
[1:17:06] and you mothers know that you don't have
[1:17:08] to teach them to lie it just comes
[1:17:09] automatically
[1:17:11] hardwired you know
[1:17:13] and
[1:17:15] in john 3 we begin to get a glimpse of
[1:17:17] the three kinds of believers
[1:17:19] verse 16. for god so loved the world
[1:17:22] pope what's his name
[1:17:24] francis he loves that verse oh god loves
[1:17:26] all
[1:17:28] yeah all those that come short of the
[1:17:30] glory of god he loved them all and he
[1:17:32] gave his only begotten son
[1:17:34] because it's only solution
[1:17:36] and then at that point they have a
[1:17:38] choice whosoever believeth on him should
[1:17:41] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:17:44] so there is hope for the believer
[1:17:46] those that make the right choice
[1:17:49] now you could have been at the lake i
[1:17:51] came across it the other day beautiful
[1:17:52] lake yeah beautiful weather but you
[1:17:55] choose to come here
[1:17:57] to see what god has for you you see
[1:18:00] and
[1:18:01] so god knows exactly what he's doing now
[1:18:04] um
[1:18:05] to get to some unfamiliar place let's
[1:18:07] say that you're going to some little
[1:18:09] point up in oklahoma you know you have
[1:18:11] to look at the road map you have to see
[1:18:12] how do we get there
[1:18:14] you know might have to detour and so
[1:18:16] forth but now we have the electronic map
[1:18:18] you see and the voice to guide you
[1:18:21] in the natural and we have a voice in
[1:18:23] the spiritual to guide you god has given
[1:18:26] us five
[1:18:28] ministries in the church
[1:18:30] yeah it doesn't just say and i'll send
[1:18:32] you the prophet no i'm gonna send you
[1:18:33] all these one different ones in church
[1:18:34] and they work together in harmony
[1:18:36] okay somebody's
[1:18:39] somebody stayed up too late last night
[1:18:42] so
[1:18:43] um
[1:18:45] this is so that we can stay focused on
[1:18:47] the journey okay
[1:18:49] god drew the lines he highlighted
[1:18:50] certain verses promises for each age and
[1:18:53] when the believer like you comes to
[1:18:55] earth
[1:18:56] then we study the map and certain verses
[1:18:58] pop out because it's for our time you
[1:19:00] know
[1:19:01] and then we know where we are we're
[1:19:02] never lost and we recognize where we are
[1:19:06] in the plan of god
[1:19:07] so you recognize the signs around you
[1:19:10] and he will quicken the truth to you
[1:19:12] we're not building an ark today no
[1:19:15] we're not trying to find how to walk to
[1:19:16] california no we're
[1:19:19] trying to find the door of the
[1:19:20] resurrection get out of here
[1:19:22] god bless us along the way he gives this
[1:19:24] word to follow but he is going to take
[1:19:26] us out of here one of these days
[1:19:28] so
[1:19:29] he's provided a voice of the prophet to
[1:19:31] guide us along the way
[1:19:33] and of course we all have we're all
[1:19:35] humans we have some regrets wish you
[1:19:37] hadn't done this and done the other
[1:19:39] and we can't change the past but we can
[1:19:42] repent
[1:19:43] and ask for the blood of jesus christ to
[1:19:44] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:19:47] and keep us
[1:19:49] shielded keep us balanced
[1:19:51] okay
[1:19:52] as for the present god gives us breath
[1:19:54] for today
[1:19:55] to live make decisions that will affect
[1:19:57] our future okay
[1:20:00] so
[1:20:01] you know what mistakes you made in the
[1:20:02] past
[1:20:03] and that was a learning process
[1:20:05] if you keep repeating that mistake then
[1:20:07] might be something wrong with your
[1:20:08] destination you know
[1:20:10] so we don't repeat mistakes
[1:20:13] mistake is one thing but if it continues
[1:20:15] then it's a habit
[1:20:16] and
[1:20:17] you got a problem you know
[1:20:19] so that alerts you to the fact that
[1:20:22] you're anointed with an evil spirit
[1:20:24] and you have a besetting sin and we have
[1:20:26] a solution right here in the word of god
[1:20:28] but you have to drop it all you have to
[1:20:31] submit
[1:20:32] you see
[1:20:33] so you need to ask for prayer and repent
[1:20:36] get yourself under the anointing under
[1:20:38] the influence of god's word you have to
[1:20:40] put yourself into a correct spiritual
[1:20:43] atmosphere
[1:20:44] the bride has made herself ready the
[1:20:46] rest of them don't care
[1:20:49] okay
[1:20:50] um
[1:20:52] so in today's lesson we're going to
[1:20:54] attempt to
[1:20:55] remind you of the truth
[1:20:57] brother brandon said very simply you've
[1:20:59] got tapes on that you've got tapes on
[1:21:00] what we believe
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:03] and they're in many languages
[1:21:06] and they're available on every cell
[1:21:08] phone on the planet
[1:21:10] the scripture and william branham's
[1:21:11] message is on every cell phone
[1:21:14] so brother brown warned us about
[1:21:16] television well i'm warning you about
[1:21:17] this little guy
[1:21:19] you get your fingers in the wrong place
[1:21:21] demons come out and take over
[1:21:23] be careful
[1:21:25] so
[1:21:27] as the bride
[1:21:28] um
[1:21:30] those that are traveling you know on
[1:21:32] this journey here in 2021
[1:21:34] um
[1:21:35] we would all do well to listen carefully
[1:21:38] and quietly to the tapes in our home
[1:21:40] where he can speak to us quietly because
[1:21:43] you can get in here well i wonder what
[1:21:45] they think you know
[1:21:46] that's why a lot of times i see brother
[1:21:48] david he's he's very unique i mean we
[1:21:50] all know that
[1:21:51] but you see
[1:21:52] i asked him have you ever sat with your
[1:21:54] wife in church well yeah a couple times
[1:21:56] but see he's back here where nobody can
[1:21:57] see him
[1:21:58] you see a lot of times pastors sitting
[1:22:00] over here and i'll say something well
[1:22:01] they look bad you know see what he
[1:22:03] thinks
[1:22:04] no just listen to the word amen yeah me
[1:22:07] and david we get along real well
[1:22:09] um
[1:22:10] where are we at here
[1:22:12] um
[1:22:13] but we we listened to the tape we
[1:22:15] listened to what brother brown said
[1:22:16] because it's our our food for today you
[1:22:18] see
[1:22:19] and
[1:22:20] he says read your bible pray get in the
[1:22:23] cool room and listen yeah
[1:22:25] all this is in the tape so according to
[1:22:27] philippians 4 7 we can have peace that
[1:22:30] goes beyond the understanding
[1:22:32] goes beyond the criticism goes beyond
[1:22:34] all the religious fanaticism legalism
[1:22:37] and will keep your heart and mind
[1:22:38] through christ jesus that's what the
[1:22:40] word does for you okay
[1:22:42] also paul wrote over here to the church
[1:22:44] in rome
[1:22:46] in chapter 8 verse 16 the spirit itself
[1:22:48] beareth witness with our spirit that
[1:22:50] shows a unity that we are the children
[1:22:52] of god and if children then we're heirs
[1:22:54] heirs of god joiners with christ if
[1:22:56] shall be that we suffer with him that we
[1:22:59] may also be glorified together
[1:23:01] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:23:03] present time are not worthy to be
[1:23:04] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:23:07] revealed in us
[1:23:09] now he did take the 20th century prophet
[1:23:11] he took the restoration prophet over
[1:23:13] there he came back and he told us about
[1:23:14] it and that whole business of the beyond
[1:23:17] the current time that's one of my
[1:23:18] favorite verses you know
[1:23:20] but um
[1:23:22] that the glory will be revealed in us
[1:23:23] not only in christ will be the glory be
[1:23:26] revealed not only in the prophet but in
[1:23:28] us you and me flesh and blood believers
[1:23:31] in the 21st century that manifest
[1:23:34] hebrews 13 8.
[1:23:35] so as we take this journey we have ups
[1:23:37] and downs we got delays sufferings
[1:23:40] rejoicing setbacks victories
[1:23:43] it's the minister's duty to encourage us
[1:23:45] and to remind us and keep the people
[1:23:48] focused on the present truth
[1:23:50] now on the internet we have people that
[1:23:52] they worry about all kinds of things
[1:23:54] just this week they were worried about
[1:23:56] these are ministers from different
[1:23:58] places
[1:23:59] and so they said well you know mary was
[1:24:01] at the upper room but where was joseph i
[1:24:04] don't know
[1:24:06] it's not important
[1:24:09] it's focused on the present truth
[1:24:12] the scriptures that pertain to our time
[1:24:14] you see now in the message discernment
[1:24:17] of spirit very important message 1960
[1:24:19] march the 8th and we are here this
[1:24:21] morning father gathered for no other
[1:24:24] purpose but to know and to study to know
[1:24:27] rather the will of god
[1:24:28] and what we must do to make christ real
[1:24:31] to the people of this generation
[1:24:33] that's the minister's one job to make
[1:24:35] christ real to the people's generation
[1:24:38] knowing surely that in the day of the
[1:24:39] judgment we will be brought face to face
[1:24:42] with this generation now these are words
[1:24:44] he's speaking in prayer but to the
[1:24:45] ministers we're going to face our people
[1:24:48] face to face
[1:24:50] and being ministers we will be judges
[1:24:52] and the people to which we have spoken
[1:24:54] to and their attitude towards the word
[1:24:56] that we bring them will determine their
[1:24:58] eternal destination
[1:25:00] that's why i want to keep you awake pay
[1:25:02] attention might be something here you
[1:25:03] didn't hear before you see
[1:25:05] therefore lord in that day we will be a
[1:25:07] judge for or against the generation that
[1:25:10] we preach to
[1:25:11] now when we travel
[1:25:13] all of you've traveled nobody's
[1:25:15] now back there where i live in the hills
[1:25:17] of tennessee there's people that they
[1:25:18] never got out of the county i mean
[1:25:20] here's a guy 40 years old he's been you
[1:25:22] know 30 miles this way and 20 miles that
[1:25:24] way and i'm going to get my car fixed
[1:25:26] and i tell them i'm going to california
[1:25:27] or arizona wherever wow it's a long ways
[1:25:31] high 40 goes right straight over there
[1:25:33] so
[1:25:34] when we travel we got to make
[1:25:35] preparations right we got to check the
[1:25:37] schedules we got to plan ahead because
[1:25:40] god is not the author of confusion
[1:25:43] see
[1:25:44] everything is right on schedule
[1:25:47] so in the message his wonders to perform
[1:25:50] god in his great wise providence moves
[1:25:53] every cog to just hit at the right time
[1:25:57] these nice cars we have out here
[1:25:59] perfect machines
[1:26:00] all you gotta do is turn the key
[1:26:02] put in gear go anywhere you want but
[1:26:04] there's pieces that are moving you know
[1:26:06] it all works perfectly
[1:26:08] so
[1:26:09] god is wise providence makes every cog
[1:26:11] hit right at the right time and that
[1:26:13] gives us faith sometimes we when we
[1:26:15] think oh everything's topsy-turvy
[1:26:17] there's no way out of this don't think
[1:26:18] that god is making it work just exactly
[1:26:22] according to his program
[1:26:24] he's never late he knows exactly what
[1:26:26] he's doing
[1:26:27] so
[1:26:28] we have
[1:26:29] we have stories in the bible well jonah
[1:26:31] the lord of terrorists will have church
[1:26:32] tonight
[1:26:34] and i'm gonna i'm going to
[1:26:36] notice who's not here
[1:26:38] send you a bill
[1:26:40] but we're going to talk about jonah
[1:26:41] tonight lord willing
[1:26:43] we have moses it looks like he was out
[1:26:45] of a way out of out of
[1:26:47] sync no god was watching every step
[1:26:50] he's 40 years in egypt became the the
[1:26:53] main teacher at the university of cairo
[1:26:56] and then god got his attention you know
[1:26:58] and so
[1:26:59] um
[1:27:01] he um
[1:27:02] brother rem says here in the great
[1:27:03] servant moses after taking the situation
[1:27:05] in his own hand
[1:27:07] he found out that he was a total failure
[1:27:10] now he climbed the ladder while he was
[1:27:11] right there at the one step from power
[1:27:14] and he ran from the presence of pharaoh
[1:27:16] and ran from the presence of god it was
[1:27:19] a stranger over there for many years 40
[1:27:21] years
[1:27:22] and he married an ethiopian girl and
[1:27:23] before we get too
[1:27:25] worried about that they were all pretty
[1:27:27] well tanned over there okay so don't
[1:27:28] worry about
[1:27:29] he it was okay god smiled on him
[1:27:32] and so she had a temper
[1:27:34] a lot of temper
[1:27:36] that wouldn't be you would it
[1:27:38] no
[1:27:39] had a lot of temper and moses had a lot
[1:27:41] of temper now we got some fireworks
[1:27:44] that was his trouble and i just imagined
[1:27:46] things weren't so peaceful back there on
[1:27:48] the backside of the desert many times
[1:27:50] but god gave it to him
[1:27:52] god was in the process
[1:27:55] so whatever you're you know with your
[1:27:57] husband your wife god has allowed this
[1:27:59] god is going to give you peace he's
[1:28:01] going to see you through
[1:28:02] you see
[1:28:03] in other words it was tough and maybe
[1:28:06] you know
[1:28:07] not always pleasant but it was god's
[1:28:09] program
[1:28:10] psalm
[1:28:11] 46 10 be still
[1:28:13] i'm god
[1:28:15] i don't need your opinions i need you
[1:28:16] all things you figured out i'm god see
[1:28:20] so brother and says if you think you
[1:28:21] married a woman that has a little temper
[1:28:25] maybe god's trying to tame you down a
[1:28:27] little bit
[1:28:28] and vice versa
[1:28:31] i mean it covers all of us
[1:28:34] now moses had been raised in the palace
[1:28:37] i don't know if you guys know anything
[1:28:38] about you know
[1:28:40] the
[1:28:41] way things run but in the palace they
[1:28:43] don't have to dress their self they
[1:28:44] don't have to make any decisions they
[1:28:46] just stand there and they put the
[1:28:47] clothes on them they put the shoes up
[1:28:49] they don't they don't make any decisions
[1:28:51] if they snap their fingers while
[1:28:52] everybody stands in attention so that's
[1:28:54] the way he was raised in the palace okay
[1:28:57] and so now after these 40 years there
[1:29:00] now he's out here in the desert
[1:29:02] and they're living in a tent
[1:29:04] on the desert where the wind blows and
[1:29:06] so
[1:29:07] uh zipporah
[1:29:09] sister zippy will call her
[1:29:12] her job was to keep cleat to keep the
[1:29:14] tent clean
[1:29:16] you know and and he's out there with the
[1:29:18] sheep now sheep are very
[1:29:21] mild-mannered they're lovely little
[1:29:22] creatures but they stink
[1:29:26] and so so moses out there with his sheep
[1:29:28] all day long and he comes home and she's
[1:29:30] trying to keep this tent clean
[1:29:32] and first thing she said now moses take
[1:29:35] off your shoes
[1:29:36] now see nobody ever told him that in the
[1:29:38] palace
[1:29:39] no no he did what he pleased and that
[1:29:42] was every day
[1:29:43] you know
[1:29:44] so one day he's out there with the sheep
[1:29:46] and god you know the clock's ticking
[1:29:49] and he came right to that time when he's
[1:29:50] going to get his attention so he's out
[1:29:52] there and there's a bush over there
[1:29:54] that's on fire wow what is that so he
[1:29:56] gets a little closer and he gets a
[1:29:58] little closer and when he gets right up
[1:30:00] close enough to the bush the voice comes
[1:30:02] out of the bush
[1:30:04] moses take off your shoes
[1:30:08] let's see he'd already heard that house
[1:30:11] god is preparing him you see
[1:30:14] so
[1:30:15] he said what was god doing schooling
[1:30:18] into the man's mind mighty prophet moses
[1:30:22] schooling into the man's mind what the
[1:30:25] program of god was
[1:30:27] through a high-tempered wife
[1:30:33] god has ways of doing things
[1:30:35] but all the prophets were humans
[1:30:38] they weren't god they were humans
[1:30:42] so brother abraham says now moses was
[1:30:44] back there waiting hurting the sheep in
[1:30:45] the desert perfect picture here before
[1:30:48] us tonight a believer out of fellowship
[1:30:50] with god
[1:30:52] now we already covered that there's
[1:30:53] three kinds of believers right
[1:30:55] i don't know which one here who's the
[1:30:57] might believer and who's the unbeliever
[1:30:58] but you know who you are don't worry
[1:30:59] about your neighborhoods take care of
[1:31:00] yourself okay
[1:31:03] so he's out there out of fellowship
[1:31:05] there he was no fellowship not one thing
[1:31:07] that god did for him in 40 years any
[1:31:10] supernatural he was out of fellowship
[1:31:12] and the church gets at when the church
[1:31:14] gets out of fellowship with god miracles
[1:31:16] sees signs and wonders sees revival
[1:31:19] cease
[1:31:21] god moves right on
[1:31:22] when you get out of fellowship the thing
[1:31:24] to do in other words to remedy this
[1:31:27] situation is keep the love of god in
[1:31:29] your heart
[1:31:32] so if you see something you don't like
[1:31:34] just thank you lord
[1:31:36] because your trial could be a lot worse
[1:31:38] just keep the love of god in your heart
[1:31:40] you see
[1:31:41] keep in fellowship with him and he will
[1:31:43] add these other things as we mature
[1:31:46] yeah now this kid here would probably
[1:31:48] like to have
[1:31:49] you know keys to the car that's not
[1:31:51] going to happen as we mature god gives
[1:31:54] you what you need
[1:31:55] and he gives us revelation as we need
[1:31:57] you know as we needed as we mature so
[1:32:01] moses had a fellowship no fellowship out
[1:32:03] there in a strange country among
[1:32:04] strangers
[1:32:06] not his own people she was ethiopian he
[1:32:07] was a jew and they're completely out of
[1:32:10] the reach of god seemingly and god all
[1:32:12] the time knowing that no matter how much
[1:32:14] of a mess
[1:32:16] man makes out of the program of god
[1:32:18] god's going to straighten it out
[1:32:21] that's the hope for today
[1:32:23] when we see things wow this and that and
[1:32:25] all these opinions god has a way
[1:32:29] he will straighten it out
[1:32:31] okay
[1:32:32] okay
[1:32:33] next time good up here
[1:32:36] okay so as we travel
[1:32:38] we got to be aware of the proper dress
[1:32:40] code
[1:32:41] yeah so it's a joy to come into church
[1:32:43] like this where everybody is dressed
[1:32:44] right
[1:32:45] most of you combed your hair you know it
[1:32:47] looks good
[1:32:49] now there used to be a difference when
[1:32:50] you travel on the airplane that you
[1:32:53] could tell the difference between men
[1:32:54] and women
[1:32:55] it's not possible anymore
[1:32:57] you know
[1:32:58] hairstyles
[1:33:00] people used to dress up a little bit
[1:33:01] maybe not a tie but at least look nice
[1:33:04] not anymore they show up in pajamas
[1:33:05] everything else on the airplane you know
[1:33:08] and now lately we've got a big argument
[1:33:10] about about which bathroom to use
[1:33:13] well every airport's got the one with
[1:33:14] the dresses okay all people's dresses go
[1:33:16] in here
[1:33:17] and all people's pants go over here
[1:33:20] it's all figured out
[1:33:21] now if you don't qualify there then you
[1:33:22] go outside
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:28] okay
[1:33:29] the way of a true prophet in phoenix
[1:33:31] and usually prosperity causes sin
[1:33:34] many people look on prosperity as
[1:33:36] blessing it would be if we could handle
[1:33:38] it right but it usually leads to sin
[1:33:40] dishonoring god and how israel had
[1:33:43] drifted onto the into the terrible sin
[1:33:45] got away from god got away from his
[1:33:47] commandments and his precepts and had
[1:33:49] gone
[1:33:50] all together off on a tantrum
[1:33:53] now maybe before you come you don't know
[1:33:55] what tantrum is well here when when you
[1:33:57] see the mother or even the grandma in
[1:33:59] the walmart and she's got the
[1:34:01] five-year-old with her especially this
[1:34:03] time of year
[1:34:05] and the five-year-old wants this either
[1:34:07] this particular cereal or this toy or
[1:34:10] whatever
[1:34:11] and she's not in the mood to buy it
[1:34:13] no
[1:34:14] then he's in the floor and he's
[1:34:16] screaming that's a tantrum see
[1:34:18] yeah
[1:34:20] says here the women walked in the
[1:34:21] streets and they're fine
[1:34:23] immodest clothes
[1:34:25] yeah they're doing that today
[1:34:28] because satan is the designer
[1:34:30] you see god made you short tall you know
[1:34:33] however you are that's god's design for
[1:34:36] you but satan fills the stores
[1:34:39] and he designs some of that clothes to
[1:34:41] make the man lust so you got to be
[1:34:43] careful
[1:34:45] so back then he says they walk the
[1:34:46] streets and they're fine in modest
[1:34:48] clothes
[1:34:49] the man went about gambling and drinking
[1:34:51] the road houses as we would call it
[1:34:53] today place of amusement
[1:34:55] wide open in the city
[1:34:57] yeah you ever been by las vegas up here
[1:34:59] it's open all the time 24 hours a day
[1:35:02] and you get in there there's no windows
[1:35:04] there's no clock
[1:35:05] you're in a world by itself well that's
[1:35:07] kind of what it's talking about here
[1:35:08] sin was disregarded by the ministry
[1:35:11] just wide open a beautiful place a great
[1:35:14] center for tourists and it lay wide open
[1:35:16] sin wasn't rebuked from the pulpit no
[1:35:18] more it was on the loose that's the kind
[1:35:20] of world back there it's the kind of
[1:35:23] world we got today
[1:35:25] so one thing that satan has accomplished
[1:35:26] here in laodicea
[1:35:29] better than any other time in history
[1:35:31] he's erased the lines
[1:35:33] of distinction
[1:35:35] we can't tell the difference between men
[1:35:37] and women anymore they've all kind of
[1:35:39] blended in you know
[1:35:41] and
[1:35:42] uh
[1:35:43] the the dress code the actions the jobs
[1:35:47] william brano had a few choice words for
[1:35:48] that
[1:35:50] tommy rot perversion sodomites
[1:35:54] because satan is erasing those lines
[1:35:56] to make it comfortable you see
[1:35:59] now
[1:35:59] let's be careful how many rocks we throw
[1:36:01] at the denominations down the street
[1:36:04] because i already checked it out you're
[1:36:05] right here between two baptist churches
[1:36:08] i was raised baptist that's where i
[1:36:09] learned to read the bible
[1:36:11] i'm not saying what they are but
[1:36:13] let's be careful how many rocks we throw
[1:36:15] at the denominations and the ladies in
[1:36:17] system when some of you permits your
[1:36:20] daughters and sons to dress the way they
[1:36:22] do
[1:36:24] take care of your place you see
[1:36:27] now i know children can be you know a
[1:36:29] challenge but
[1:36:31] they must live your convictions until
[1:36:33] they have convictions of their own
[1:36:36] okay if they're gonna enjoy your
[1:36:38] groceries and in your furniture and your
[1:36:40] air conditioning well then we've got
[1:36:41] rules you know
[1:36:43] that's right yeah
[1:36:46] so
[1:36:47] i know anyone's at the end time now
[1:36:49] friends this is a very important message
[1:36:51] when brother brandon preached this in
[1:36:53] july of 65
[1:36:55] i was a young man
[1:36:58] had lots of hair thin
[1:37:00] and i was sitting like from here to that
[1:37:01] organ that's how close i was when he was
[1:37:02] preaching that
[1:37:04] and she went over my head but he says
[1:37:06] here
[1:37:08] he says whether we're methodists baptist
[1:37:10] presbyterian pentecostals what more
[1:37:12] we're all the same we're not the same
[1:37:14] you're a separated people holy unto the
[1:37:16] lord dedicated to the word of the word
[1:37:18] and to the spirit of god to bear fruit
[1:37:20] of his promise of this day
[1:37:23] somebody's going to live the promises of
[1:37:24] this day it's not just words on tape you
[1:37:27] know
[1:37:28] and he says and you're not one of them i
[1:37:30] know that's awful strong but it's the
[1:37:31] truth just the same you're dedicated to
[1:37:33] a service in this day come out from
[1:37:35] amongst it i don't care how real it
[1:37:37] sounds how much they impersonate it's a
[1:37:40] lie if it's contrary to god's word of
[1:37:43] the hour
[1:37:46] i don't care what it is if it's contrary
[1:37:47] to the written word of god of the hour
[1:37:49] it's a lie god will have nothing to do
[1:37:51] with it no matter how sincere how
[1:37:53] educated how smart how true it sounds
[1:37:55] how reasonable it sounds if it's
[1:37:57] contrary to the word of this hour
[1:38:00] now according to paul
[1:38:02] uh the ministry must be properly
[1:38:04] equipped for this journey okay
[1:38:08] let's look at second timothy
[1:38:10] chapter three
[1:38:12] here's paul preaching to timothy
[1:38:15] he sent him a letter
[1:38:17] and
[1:38:19] where are we at here in
[1:38:22] second timothy chapter 3
[1:38:25] and verse 16
[1:38:27] says
[1:38:30] all scripture
[1:38:31] okay that's everything in this bible
[1:38:32] that god has brought to us and we've had
[1:38:34] this bible since early 1600
[1:38:37] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:38:39] god and is profitable for doctrine for
[1:38:42] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:38:44] and righteousness that the man of god
[1:38:46] may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto
[1:38:49] all good works
[1:38:50] that's how the man of god that stands in
[1:38:52] the pulpit must be prepared you see
[1:38:56] and for this journey we also got to have
[1:38:58] proper papers now you all know about
[1:38:59] papers
[1:39:01] everybody that's born we assume has a
[1:39:03] birth certificate proving when you
[1:39:06] actually arrive
[1:39:07] and then some go on to get a passport
[1:39:10] they have to have passports going to go
[1:39:12] into another country
[1:39:13] and um
[1:39:15] but to travel to difficult places
[1:39:18] you've got to have a visa stamped in
[1:39:19] your passport
[1:39:20] so because our natural birth is a birth
[1:39:23] certificate born again it's the passport
[1:39:25] and the baptismal holy ghost is the visa
[1:39:29] now when we go to beyond the curtain of
[1:39:30] time
[1:39:31] in the rejected king 1960
[1:39:34] he says here and i heard a voice then
[1:39:36] that spoke to me
[1:39:37] that was in the room
[1:39:39] now remember in this vision
[1:39:42] he sees his body laying there 20 feet
[1:39:44] away he's up here in this vision
[1:39:46] he can see both both dimensions
[1:39:49] and he says the voice was in the room
[1:39:51] this is what you preached was the holy
[1:39:53] ghost this is perfect love and nothing
[1:39:56] can enter here without it
[1:39:58] i am more determined than ever in my
[1:39:59] life that it takes perfect love to get
[1:40:02] there
[1:40:02] my precious friend my beloved my
[1:40:04] darlings in the gospel my begotten
[1:40:06] children of god listen to me your pastor
[1:40:09] i wish there was some way i could
[1:40:10] explain it to you
[1:40:12] there's no words i couldn't find it it's
[1:40:14] not found anywhere but just beyond this
[1:40:17] last breath is the most glorious thing
[1:40:20] you ever saw there's no way to explain
[1:40:22] it there's no way i just can't do it but
[1:40:25] whatever you do friends lay aside
[1:40:27] everything
[1:40:28] till you get that perfect love
[1:40:31] get to a spot that you can love
[1:40:32] everybody
[1:40:34] every enemy everything else
[1:40:36] that one visit there has made me a
[1:40:38] different man i can never never never be
[1:40:40] the same brother random that i was
[1:40:43] a few months later he's telling the same
[1:40:45] thing up in klamath falls washington
[1:40:48] and um
[1:40:49] just remember i'll say this with the
[1:40:51] faith that i have in that vision or
[1:40:53] whatever it was and i'll speak in the
[1:40:54] name of the lord except you have perfect
[1:40:56] love you will not be there
[1:41:02] um because nothing can enter there
[1:41:05] without it your spirit would be out of
[1:41:07] place
[1:41:08] my friends you old people young people
[1:41:10] you don't know what time you're going to
[1:41:12] leave
[1:41:13] if you check the obituaries in the
[1:41:14] sunday paper if they still have one they
[1:41:16] didn't all die at 95.
[1:41:19] there's kids there's all kinds of people
[1:41:20] in there so you don't know when you're
[1:41:21] leaving
[1:41:22] we don't know but let me persuade you as
[1:41:24] a christian brother one that loves you
[1:41:26] except you're born again and the spirit
[1:41:28] of god
[1:41:30] and loves
[1:41:31] except you're born again and the spirit
[1:41:33] of god and the love of god comes into
[1:41:36] your heart you'll certainly miss that
[1:41:38] place
[1:41:39] so we have the formula which got to do
[1:41:41] it the bride has made herself ready
[1:41:43] so we make preparations we have the
[1:41:45] proper dress code
[1:41:47] properly equipped
[1:41:48] proper papers and one more thing got to
[1:41:50] be flexible because whatever plan you
[1:41:52] make it might not work
[1:41:55] you know they might delay the flight the
[1:41:57] things can happen so there's a precise
[1:41:59] schedule only god knows the details of
[1:42:02] the schedule
[1:42:03] now everything's right on schedule
[1:42:05] we you know we get excited we want to no
[1:42:08] just
[1:42:09] relax
[1:42:10] read the first three pages of
[1:42:12] questions and answers on the seals it'll
[1:42:14] help you a lot
[1:42:17] so we get zealous we come up with
[1:42:19] private ideas interpretations we figure
[1:42:21] out we make plans but one thing for sure
[1:42:24] god will fulfill his word right on
[1:42:26] schedule
[1:42:27] every time you see
[1:42:29] and there's no room for fanatics or
[1:42:31] legalist and along our journey we're
[1:42:33] going to face a lot of temptations yeah
[1:42:35] all kinds of things trials pitfalls
[1:42:38] but the word says in hebrews 4 that we
[1:42:41] have a high priest that can be touched
[1:42:43] by the feelings of our infirmities
[1:42:45] because he was tempted at all points
[1:42:47] like we are
[1:42:48] but without sin
[1:42:50] so we're going to
[1:42:52] press fast forward here and jump around
[1:42:53] a little bit so his mercy and his
[1:42:55] understanding extend to every part of
[1:42:57] the journey
[1:42:59] there's no part of it that he doesn't
[1:43:00] know about okay
[1:43:05] the word tells us the mercy of god is to
[1:43:07] all generations
[1:43:09] even to ours
[1:43:11] we're tempted but we have an advocate
[1:43:13] and we can come boldly into his presence
[1:43:15] and ask for help
[1:43:16] you see seek his mercy it's like an
[1:43:18] oasis that's why we're here this morning
[1:43:20] it's like a refreshing you see
[1:43:22] we're not victims of our environment
[1:43:25] we're victors we're overcomers you see
[1:43:28] we're more than conquerors in christ
[1:43:30] jesus our captain said in revelations 12
[1:43:33] they overcame
[1:43:34] him the enemy by the blood of the lamb
[1:43:37] and the word of their testimony
[1:43:39] so we all have a testimony of some size
[1:43:41] you know
[1:43:42] so our journey we become
[1:43:44] restless we become critical
[1:43:46] and
[1:43:48] bad attitudes come up yeah in every car
[1:43:50] full of kids that happens
[1:43:53] the farther you go the more restless
[1:43:56] and where's the promise of his coming
[1:43:58] all things continue the same since
[1:44:00] brother brown left
[1:44:01] i'm getting tired of the pastor always
[1:44:02] preaching right at me
[1:44:04] a lot of griping and complaining and
[1:44:06] don't smile i know that you're
[1:44:08] humans and that happens
[1:44:10] so
[1:44:12] the thing is
[1:44:13] you're bored you've got too much free
[1:44:15] time you got to go back to the four
[1:44:16] steps
[1:44:17] bible
[1:44:18] church facebook listen and pray
[1:44:21] your life will be better
[1:44:23] better atmosphere in the church too
[1:44:25] so if we would spend that same time
[1:44:28] reading the word and praying for others
[1:44:31] maybe there's needs in this church i
[1:44:32] mean you got all kinds of people
[1:44:34] there's people laying at home in bed
[1:44:35] right now
[1:44:37] in fact i was going to mention brother
[1:44:38] sanders was going to come today with his
[1:44:40] family but the wife got some kind of
[1:44:42] pain while she's in bed couldn't come
[1:44:45] but the boy
[1:44:46] i know you thought he left
[1:44:48] he was in the hospital for five months
[1:44:51] preparing for a very important operation
[1:44:53] because that boy's got spinal difficulty
[1:44:56] and he's 21 now
[1:44:58] and he's been through three
[1:45:00] very critical operations one was 12
[1:45:02] hours long
[1:45:03] they put some rods in him now he can sit
[1:45:05] up straight he's on the way to getting
[1:45:06] walking so keep them in prayer
[1:45:09] so there's people to pray for you know
[1:45:12] and
[1:45:14] there's there's things that need to be
[1:45:15] done
[1:45:16] so
[1:45:17] if we spend our time in prayer in the
[1:45:20] word the trip will seem shorter and
[1:45:22] it'll improve our attitude
[1:45:24] and um we'll be in better condition for
[1:45:27] the journey
[1:45:28] so along the way we see signs that tell
[1:45:30] us how far it's going to be how close
[1:45:32] are we to the destination you know when
[1:45:34] i left texarkana the other morning
[1:45:35] coming this way
[1:45:37] you know one sign whatever it is 150 130
[1:45:40] miles away then there's no more signs
[1:45:42] then when you get down a little closer
[1:45:44] okay there's a sign now there's another
[1:45:46] one they get closer together now i could
[1:45:49] i could stop there and and camp out at
[1:45:51] that sign but i never get here
[1:45:53] so we're now interested the signs just
[1:45:55] tell us that we're getting closer you
[1:45:56] see
[1:45:57] and so we gear our expectations to the
[1:46:00] signs because we know about how long
[1:46:02] it's going to take to get there
[1:46:04] and we know if there's time for a nap
[1:46:06] a meal
[1:46:08] or uh get our shoes on comb our hair you
[1:46:10] know the children get restless in the
[1:46:12] back seat yeah i raised three kids
[1:46:14] and they're tearing things up and
[1:46:16] popcorn stuff everywhere
[1:46:19] it makes you nervous
[1:46:20] but
[1:46:21] when you get within a few blocks of
[1:46:22] grandma's house oh
[1:46:25] now we're almost there kids
[1:46:27] straighten up be nice put on a happy
[1:46:29] face
[1:46:30] in other words be the little darlings
[1:46:32] that grandma thinks you are
[1:46:37] so it's time to get serious we're about
[1:46:39] ready to take off and some people aren't
[1:46:41] even dressed yet it's terrible
[1:46:43] but the holy spirit is not short-sighted
[1:46:45] okay our god can see the entire journey
[1:46:49] because from the prophetic realm
[1:46:50] everything's present tense you see
[1:46:53] so he can see the whole thing from the
[1:46:54] beginning to the end
[1:46:56] and god can see through time and space
[1:46:58] he knows all about the fuss as you had
[1:47:00] this week he knows if there was peace in
[1:47:02] the car coming to church
[1:47:04] or if you were giving your husband a try
[1:47:06] silent treatment yeah it happens
[1:47:09] you can get the coffee you want it
[1:47:10] whatever you know
[1:47:12] so god can see all this
[1:47:14] and you can see what's going to happen
[1:47:15] next sunday also so all you got to do is
[1:47:18] pay attention
[1:47:19] stay in step stay in the rhythm of the
[1:47:21] word and you'll get there you see he
[1:47:24] sees all he knows all he knows the
[1:47:26] secret thoughts you have and the devil
[1:47:28] sets traps along the way be careful
[1:47:31] laodicea is a like a
[1:47:34] minefield
[1:47:35] and your attitude towards god's word
[1:47:37] this morning
[1:47:38] um and towards god's messengers
[1:47:41] determines your destination
[1:47:43] it doesn't matter if you can quote it a
[1:47:44] lot of people can quote it over here at
[1:47:46] the baptist church they're quoting it
[1:47:48] but they don't have the revelation see
[1:47:50] so character is not a gift it's a
[1:47:52] victory
[1:47:53] indicating that there's things to
[1:47:55] overcome
[1:47:56] see
[1:47:57] so peter was very rough
[1:47:59] mary was very mild
[1:48:01] both still had things to overcome both
[1:48:04] had to be in the upper room because
[1:48:06] character is not a gift no matter what
[1:48:08] your name is
[1:48:09] so we prepare for the trip
[1:48:12] and we have expectations of the reunion
[1:48:14] when we get there
[1:48:16] we'll see our loved ones and
[1:48:19] we'll be on this earth for a month or so
[1:48:21] that's part of the gospel
[1:48:23] in the new testament remember when we
[1:48:24] preached on book of acts he was with
[1:48:27] them about a month they got some things
[1:48:29] solved and then he left well in our case
[1:48:32] there's going to be a rapture there's
[1:48:33] going to be first is resurrection
[1:48:36] then rapture
[1:48:37] and so
[1:48:39] uh since we're curious people then we're
[1:48:41] going to wonder well did so and so make
[1:48:42] it so god solves all that in that month
[1:48:44] or so then he takes us up to all our
[1:48:46] attention beyond him
[1:48:48] so
[1:48:49] god has arranged it in such a way
[1:48:52] that he brings our loved ones to us just
[1:48:54] before the trip just before the end of
[1:48:56] the trip just before we get to the
[1:48:57] resurrection
[1:48:58] he brings our loved ones to us he told
[1:49:00] one brother he said now one of these
[1:49:01] days you're gonna be in your house
[1:49:03] and you'll hear a knock on the door
[1:49:06] of course you go check it out there's
[1:49:09] your wife there's your mother whoever
[1:49:10] that went on years ago
[1:49:12] then you know it's serious you see
[1:49:15] so we have this time for
[1:49:18] greetings time for fellowship
[1:49:20] and
[1:49:21] then he takes us all to his house
[1:49:23] and we're in love with him
[1:49:26] god is a jealous god that's one of his
[1:49:28] names jealous
[1:49:30] okay
[1:49:31] and um
[1:49:33] so
[1:49:34] as we
[1:49:35] are on this journey
[1:49:37] we long you know along there we meet
[1:49:40] others that are on the same journey you
[1:49:42] know god sends visitors by here from
[1:49:43] somewhere oh you're one of us yeah
[1:49:46] and so um we
[1:49:48] because we know the prophetic message
[1:49:50] because we know the scriptures we have a
[1:49:52] lot to be accountable for you see we've
[1:49:55] seen many signs
[1:49:56] we've seen signs where we're all getting
[1:49:58] closer together and there isn't far to
[1:50:00] go we're almost there it's a great
[1:50:02] pulling like a magnet you know
[1:50:05] and
[1:50:06] we're of one spirit
[1:50:09] baptized the same way god is taking care
[1:50:12] of his people you see
[1:50:14] so some may think that oh i sure left a
[1:50:17] lot did you
[1:50:19] compared to what you're going to get no
[1:50:22] no in luke
[1:50:24] peter said look here we left everything
[1:50:26] to follow you
[1:50:27] you know jesus said verily verily i say
[1:50:29] unto you
[1:50:30] there's no man that has left house or
[1:50:33] parents or brother or wife or children
[1:50:35] anything for the sake of the kingdom of
[1:50:37] god who shall not receive manifold more
[1:50:40] in this life
[1:50:41] and life everlasting
[1:50:43] it's worth it people
[1:50:45] you can't leave too much
[1:50:48] so as we finish here this morning we
[1:50:50] don't try to keep you two hours but just
[1:50:53] enough to to make you go dig go find the
[1:50:55] rest of the story you know
[1:50:57] and
[1:50:58] we we know there's probably visitors but
[1:51:00] this is for everyone all you people
[1:51:02] looking on the internet this is for you
[1:51:04] too
[1:51:05] this is something that you can you can
[1:51:06] touch you know and if you're sitting
[1:51:08] here and you're hearing some of this for
[1:51:09] the first time
[1:51:11] and you want to get on this journey with
[1:51:12] us we can help you that's why it crosses
[1:51:15] up there to remind you that's where you
[1:51:17] start your journey
[1:51:18] so let's stand together
[1:51:20] it's good to be here
[1:51:21] it'll be good to be here this evening
[1:51:23] lord willing but if the spirit of god is
[1:51:25] knocking at your door don't let it go
[1:51:27] another minute because god has given you
[1:51:30] an opportunity to become part of this
[1:51:32] journey he's called you for that
[1:51:35] and it's very very serious
[1:51:38] christian heavenly father we thank you
[1:51:39] for your word we thank you lord for
[1:51:41] bringing us together
[1:51:43] we just pray that the word may find a
[1:51:45] resting place in every heart
[1:51:47] somebody will be encouraged to walk
[1:51:49] closer to you to be in step to be in
[1:51:51] tune
[1:51:52] help us now we ask in jesus name amen
[1:52:02] it's easy to forget that we're going
[1:52:04] somewhere isn't it
[1:52:05] it's you know one of i guess the
[1:52:08] greatest uh
[1:52:10] things in traveling is the great detour
[1:52:13] or what we call the wrong turn
[1:52:16] or you miss your exit
[1:52:19] you know i remember when we first
[1:52:22] started they start putting this express
[1:52:24] lane
[1:52:25] in
[1:52:26] and we get on the express lane and
[1:52:30] you know
[1:52:31] couldn't get off of it
[1:52:36] you know what i mean and then you're way
[1:52:38] away from where
[1:52:40] that you're going
[1:52:41] and and we had to learn every express
[1:52:45] exit
[1:52:46] every tricky way they did it
[1:52:48] every reason they put a bend in the road
[1:52:51] to make you get on it
[1:52:53] and so
[1:52:55] you know the journey is not without
[1:52:57] resistance
[1:53:00] you know what i'm saying so that's what
[1:53:01] i think brother george has
[1:53:03] you know really given us an admonition
[1:53:06] if you're not totally conscious
[1:53:11] at what's at stake
[1:53:13] then all the little foxes get in there
[1:53:16] and all the little things that you let
[1:53:18] gel go and all those loose ends and and
[1:53:22] then to them you know
[1:53:24] then it starts polluting your
[1:53:27] decision making
[1:53:30] you know you get soft
[1:53:32] and then
[1:53:33] you know you you're not sharp to make
[1:53:37] the right decisions and the right
[1:53:39] choices so
[1:53:41] you know and i think that's the overall
[1:53:43] purpose here is if we're here so that we
[1:53:46] can make
[1:53:48] the right choices
[1:53:50] that we can make sure
[1:53:53] that we're on the journey that's our
[1:53:56] upmost goal
[1:53:58] is to make the rapture
[1:54:01] and it's not us planning the trip it's
[1:54:04] letting him plan the trip for us through
[1:54:07] his word
[1:54:08] he'll speak to us
[1:54:10] day by day a little while in the world
[1:54:12] shall see me no more but you shall see
[1:54:15] me
[1:54:17] amen for i will not leave you
[1:54:18] comfortless
[1:54:20] but i'll come to you again and i'll send
[1:54:22] you the comforter and he shall lead you
[1:54:25] and guide you
[1:54:27] into all truth and righteousness and i
[1:54:29] think that's what we've got to ask
[1:54:31] ourselves this morning
[1:54:33] is the spirit of god leading us and
[1:54:37] guiding us in all truth and
[1:54:39] righteousness are we in tune
[1:54:42] with that spirit have we got our lives
[1:54:45] and he gave us some secrets this morning
[1:54:48] to get in tuned read your bible
[1:54:52] amen that puts them on your mind
[1:54:55] right listen to listen to some tape
[1:55:00] right the church age book is the history
[1:55:02] of the church
[1:55:04] and it's the prophecy of the spirits
[1:55:07] working in the framework of the church
[1:55:09] so it will expose to you all the spirits
[1:55:12] that are working against us a tremendous
[1:55:16] insight and what's the greatest pray
[1:55:20] those four things because the we've got
[1:55:23] to have a consciousness
[1:55:26] of the fact that we're supposed to leave
[1:55:28] here
[1:55:30] and and i and i i really feel in my
[1:55:33] heart that's what satan's trying to do
[1:55:36] give us amnesia
[1:55:38] make us numb
[1:55:40] make us not alert get us to the place
[1:55:42] that we don't think things matter it
[1:55:45] doesn't matter
[1:55:47] anymore
[1:55:48] you know i mean it's sad isn't it when
[1:55:50] in our country people can just go into a
[1:55:53] store steal stuff jump up and it's not
[1:55:56] even a crime
[1:55:59] it shows you that there's an atmosphere
[1:56:01] changing
[1:56:03] the mental
[1:56:04] the mental
[1:56:06] working
[1:56:08] of people's minds
[1:56:11] is now being seared
[1:56:14] with a hot iron
[1:56:17] because they no longer
[1:56:20] wish to retain god
[1:56:22] in their consciousness
[1:56:25] and so you see the warning this morning
[1:56:28] do you know maybe not running from this
[1:56:30] side of the platform to that but we're
[1:56:32] not built on emotion we're built on the
[1:56:35] solidness
[1:56:37] of god's word
[1:56:39] plow
[1:56:40] word plow you can build something with
[1:56:44] word building blocks
[1:56:46] you know when all the sweat's gone
[1:56:49] and everything's gone and all the
[1:56:51] emotions gone and all the labor's gone
[1:56:54] what remains
[1:56:56] the word
[1:56:58] the block
[1:56:59] so you know so this morning let's
[1:57:02] reinvigorate ourselves
[1:57:05] let's
[1:57:06] refocus our purpose
[1:57:09] let's realize
[1:57:10] no matter what's going on in the world
[1:57:13] with entertainment and everything this
[1:57:15] rapture
[1:57:17] is coming
[1:57:19] the door
[1:57:21] we're going to the door of the
[1:57:24] resurrection
[1:57:26] we want to get to the place
[1:57:28] that the resurrection is going to happen
[1:57:33] you understand and and you know and i i
[1:57:37] say it in myself
[1:57:38] many times the rapture is not a time
[1:57:42] it's a condition
[1:57:45] that you come to the place
[1:57:47] that you're in rapturing condition you
[1:57:50] come to the place
[1:57:52] that you're at the door of the
[1:57:55] resurrection waiting right there for
[1:57:57] that door to swing open
[1:57:59] and it's going to be too late to try to
[1:58:02] run to get there
[1:58:03] so what a beautiful thought really to
[1:58:06] bring us all
[1:58:07] into remembrance that we're not living
[1:58:12] to stay
[1:58:13] we're living to leave
[1:58:16] this message is not a staying message
[1:58:19] to teach us how to live here and be
[1:58:21] happy it's to teach us how to leave here
[1:58:24] amen how many want to leave
[1:58:27] amen i want to go home don't you amen
[1:58:31] let's bow our heads together again and
[1:58:35] and
[1:58:38] then maybe we sing that little song i
[1:58:40] like it so much i'm thinking of a
[1:58:42] rapture but let's just take a moment and
[1:58:44] bow our heads and each in our heart
[1:58:48] just come before the lord in our own
[1:58:50] heart we each know our own life
[1:58:53] we each know how much time we're giving
[1:58:55] to the word of god
[1:58:58] we each know what's been pulling us
[1:59:00] astray
[1:59:06] we know many of us are in places in our
[1:59:08] life where
[1:59:12] we
[1:59:13] have relationships and we've got to
[1:59:16] determine is this relationship
[1:59:19] taking me to eternity or
[1:59:22] is it pulling me away
[1:59:24] is my job
[1:59:26] leading me closer to god or is it
[1:59:29] pulling me away
[1:59:30] i certainly don't want to miss
[1:59:35] the rapture
[1:59:39] i have a book
[1:59:42] i can sit down and read that god can
[1:59:44] speak to me
[1:59:46] i speak to him in prayer
[1:59:48] he speaks back to me through his word
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:56] i seek his face and
[1:59:59] because he's a counselor
[2:00:01] a prince of peace and a mighty god
[2:00:06] and he promised that he would lead me
[2:00:08] and guide me
[2:00:13] you know if i have a great promise
[2:00:16] then i ought to seek his counsel
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:21] ought to seek his face
[2:00:24] seek his advice
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:28] maybe this morning you'd ask yourself
[2:00:30] have i really been seeking the advice of
[2:00:32] the lord
[2:00:35] have i been seeking his counsel and his
[2:00:37] leadership
[2:00:40] in decisions that
[2:00:42] is going to affect me and those around
[2:00:44] me
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:47] i want to
[2:00:48] shake myself this morning
[2:00:52] i want to renew my thought process and
[2:00:59] we've been told in his word this morning
[2:01:01] not to worry about the wrong things
[2:01:05] don't worry about the things of the
[2:01:07] world
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:10] but we want to take
[2:01:12] worry about our condition and our soul
[2:01:16] and place it in the
[2:01:18] palm of his hand
[2:01:20] this morning
[2:01:22] heavenly father
[2:01:24] as we approach you and my hands lifted
[2:01:28] father before you then
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:33] it behooves us to become
[2:01:36] so much
[2:01:38] more aware
[2:01:40] of the life of your word in the life of
[2:01:43] the resurrection
[2:01:45] and the door of the resurrection
[2:01:48] and not let this gospel become common or
[2:01:51] little
[2:01:55] to fail to give regard
[2:01:58] to our decisions and
[2:02:01] our
[2:02:02] lifestyle
[2:02:05] and to make an effort father to bring
[2:02:07] everything
[2:02:10] under the
[2:02:11] leadership of your word in your spirit
[2:02:16] this morning father we set our hearts
[2:02:18] back and shake ourselves
[2:02:21] lord i can't forget i'm on a journey
[2:02:26] i can't forget i do not belong in this
[2:02:29] world
[2:02:31] i can't forget i'm not from here lord
[2:02:34] i'm not from here
[2:02:36] this is not my place i want to go home
[2:02:40] lord shake the voices away from me
[2:02:44] the pleasures that are being offered
[2:02:47] father
[2:02:48] let those great eagle wings blow over my
[2:02:52] nest today
[2:02:54] that i might fly and soar
[2:02:57] into the heavenlies
[2:02:59] i ask you to deal with our hearts this
[2:03:01] morning
[2:03:03] and lord jesus if there's one here this
[2:03:06] morning that doesn't know you
[2:03:10] that they haven't heard of the sacrifice
[2:03:13] at calvary and the blood that you shed
[2:03:17] for our sins that we could go free from
[2:03:20] habits
[2:03:22] we can go free from depressions and
[2:03:26] and sickness
[2:03:29] that you've come and you've
[2:03:31] you've
[2:03:32] brought all things into your hands
[2:03:38] well there's one that hasn't accepted
[2:03:40] you this morning
[2:03:42] and your spirit has dealt with their
[2:03:44] heart
[2:03:46] may in their spirits say lord deal with
[2:03:48] me
[2:03:51] if there's one that's never been
[2:03:52] baptized this morning
[2:03:55] in real biblical bible
[2:03:59] baptism
[2:04:01] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:04:06] for the remission of sins that
[2:04:09] they might receive the holy spirit
[2:04:13] father we ask that you deal
[2:04:16] with their heart
[2:04:20] that we'd examine ourselves as i have i
[2:04:22] done this right
[2:04:24] have i done this according to the
[2:04:26] scriptures
[2:04:27] have i done it god's way
[2:04:30] father may we be conscious of a journey
[2:04:32] there has to be a way
[2:04:36] you can't make the journey without a way
[2:04:39] and you said that you were the way the
[2:04:41] truth and the life
[2:04:43] and no man cometh unto the father but by
[2:04:46] you
[2:04:47] this morning we ask ourselves father do
[2:04:50] we have you
[2:04:53] and our challenge from this pulpit this
[2:04:55] morning through the message that we've
