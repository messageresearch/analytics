that are prepared to do it if you could just come there wasn't any prayer request turned in but we know that there's many needs that are represented in the body just ask brother Andrew to come maybe you want to lift your hand up for a need that it's on your heart and you just want to maybe an unspoken prayer request just hands all up over the place special needs represented God sees that so as we just say a prayer over the tithes and offerings and this need maybe look around somebody you haven't seen or maybe you've been going through a trial for a long time and you've gotten weary that maybe you feel like you've even stopped believing why don't you just put that back on your heart and believe that this meeting is going to be the meeting where everything changes because faith comes by hearing the word and the word is going to be preached and why don't you just Reach Out by faith and receive what you have need of during this time bless [Music] let us pray together our heavenly father Lord we we thank you Lord Jesus that you've given us something to praise you with Lord You've Lord when we were going one way Lord you caught our attention thank you Lord Jesus Lord you brought

thankful to serve a living God uh just want to say uh very thankful brother uh David invite us to be here uh I think the last time I here was quite a few years ago I even lost memory of what what year is that but you're a marvelous marvelous congregation and I remember that after the service at T RIT David I said I never been have a such atmosphere than the poing in my life to uh uh people that pulling on the word and that love the Lord I'm so privileged to fellowship with you and we're serving to the same God and they the same message that we heard in this hour and Brother David has U made us so welcome uh sister lesle I think if if I have eating more I'll be popped the hospitality just just un unreal I appreciate that so so much and Brandon Matthew and uh all of you and um uh one more person I want to thank is uh my pastor brother Tom and uh he's been my uh boom and boom friend that is my mentor and in all all these years since I've came into the message and I appreciate that so much and uh can Minister along with brother Tom I feel so humble and brother Michael uh just um uh I feel we're like a twin brothers brother Michael I love you love you so much and the word that he has ministered in the church in the last uh few years it was just incredible incredible and I know God has at hand and on this young man and um uh you you're going to hear him and brother Tommy in the next two days uh but I hope uh it will be a little start uh uh tonight and I know you love the word so um I know the word going to meet uh every one of our need if we have the right attitude toward him if you can give me some volume sorry my my uh my voice is kind of weak now just um naturally um I speak a Chinese better than my English so but but I can't make it sound is strong uh forceful when I'm speaking in English but I hope you bear with me if you don't mind I just want to turn to the scripture right away let's turn to a book of uh uh Second Corinthians [Music] chapter 11 2 Corinthians chapter 11 2 Corinthians chapter 11 let's read from uh verse one would to God he could bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have exposed you to one husbands that I may present you as a chaste version to Christ but I fear lest by any means as a serpent begal leave through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupt from the Simplicity that is in Christ amen may the Lord bless his word let's just bow our head one more time dear heavenly father as we have opened up the the scripture but Lord it take you to open up yourself because the whole Bible is talking about you so Lord if you don't open it we're just a scratching the surface Lord we probably can sing we probably can pray we probably can even preach and people can even believe but Lord if you don't open up yourself all this effort is going to be in vain so Lord I I pray that your Holy Spirit open up your word to US Open up not to our mind but to our heart to our soul that's a place that you dwell that's a place that a miracle would happen because that word life is going to Spring forth so Lord I pray you to take the whole service control that every spirit and in your hand no matter it's a spirit of Doubt or Spirit of unbelief or Spirit of sickness Lord I put that all under your control as your presence are coming down lord I pray that that your word heals your people and we ask it in Jesus name amen you may be seated and we all know God in this hour has sented the prophet to us uh I wonder sometime if we were sufficiently impressed by a messenger that God has sended to us I wonder sometime if we're in sufficiently impressed by the voice that we heard that in this last hour is this a human voice or there is a voice behind that voice is this a man's voice or is a supernatural voice that is speaking to us in this hour by the Vindication of the Prophet then in this hour by the ministry that have been Vindicated like none like no other has ever been Vindicated and sometimes if we're born in a message if we're RIS up in a message a lot of time I find out people uh people doesn't lost their Bel to the message but intensity to believe is start to diminishing the level of dedication the fervency the passion to the word of God seems Seems like it just cannot break the cycle from one generation to another generation start to diminishing but I believe if the word of God God sent it to us if we believe and we know this is the last age this is the last hour God required a certain dedication certain conservation like no others it doesn't take you go back to the world in order for you to elect your pastor but David has shared as a testimony to us many uh many times to you and to to us and we know how he came out from the world and when I met him when I heard him preaching I can see the intensity of it I can see the dedication of it for brother Tom and the same thing and that when he shared his testimon when he preached the word I can saw that at a ferv say that a passion that's in there and I can see this in myself I was from the world and raise it up in the world and coming over into the denomination and been confused all those years about when I hear the word I was cleared it up I know this is the god means for me I know this is the word not only because I know the word because I know the word has a change my life and I can see that even for Michael that he was a born and a raised up in in a message but I don't see the U the lethargy is that a word of lethargy at of it is I don't see the the lacking of the intensity of the belief when a person that come to believe the word to uh to know that the word is the truth and to dedicate it our life and I can see that but also I also win this as the time goes on as the coming of the Lord is seemingly like a uh delay which is not delay at at all but God has his long time but seemingly the intensity of the peoples that believe to the word of God you said how how intense I I I I need to be I want to ask how dedicated you are how surrendered in your life you are how consecrated are you give yourself to the word of God and that shows the intensity of your belief that shows the cons ation the tottal surrender of a whole being to the word of God in this hour it's not by talk it's not by speaking not by word not by letter but better dedication all right you want to see some fruit that's the fruit that we want to see and when you saw that you know that the person give himself to the word and you saw how the Lord wizard that and led to the life of of God to be reflected in that person but as a time goes on you'll find out and that type of uh intensity start to lower start to getting uh diminishing but Paul said over here said I'm jealous over you I was thinking what Paul is a jealous about he said I fear Les by any memes that means that there's a lot of memes that it can fulfill what Paul was feared about is that fear Les be any memes as a serpent begal Eve through this subtlty so your mind should be corrupted from Simplicity which is the singleness that is in Christ Simplicity that means the singleness sincerity honesty the virtue of a one who is afraid from a pretends and hypocrisy not self-seeking openness of heart and manifest itself of a generosity that is the Simplicity that Paul was seeking at his a fear that a serpent might be G and how this the serpent started is not started from Earth this old serpent Started From Heaven how his is began that's how Paul would Trace his the back you can be in um deceived or be lost of the singleness of the sincerity the honesty the singleness of mind to God by the deceived of Satan and how Satan start started Satan started from not Earth but started From Heaven he was a cast out from Heaven why he was a casted out from Heaven he was a casted out because of a jealousy what is this jealousy about he wanted better Kingdom that Michael had he got some own idea he had his own sermon that he want to preach he had his own idea about what the kingdom of God should be run he has his own idea de about opinion about what is the word of God should be interpreted let's dramatize a little bit one day Satan just walk into the church of a God not the denomination but in heaven because he's a song leader sorry it's not I'm not talking about that he's a worship leader because he's the head of all of them he had a beauty if we see he got a Charisma he got a personality that no angel will possess he got a something that a better than anybody else he haded something that he want to see he wanted something I have something want to say you Worship the Lord you Worship the Lord aren't you tired you hear your pastor and the Archangel that god Jehovah constantly preaching to you the same subject all the time aren't you tired you're sinning every day holy holy holy are you run out of a word is that the only thing that you can think about come on get something else get some pump in it get some beat in it get some idea in it then the Fall start is the jealousy of the devil that make can become a zealous that he want to pushes his idea forward right after all jealousy and the zealous is the same word and so in the separation from unbeliever Brother Brandman said in heaven what may Lucifer jealous he goes over and Anor and puts him up a better Kingdom he wanted at a bigger Kingdom more brighter better and prettier he thought he got some B better idea he s he get a some better opinion and possess some equality I possess the quality that god Jehovah had why I have to be a secondary position why my idea doesn't get a push it through why I'm just become just a leading little worship why we have to be single-minded in one thing that what is the God has said isn't that sounds like we're in this age you know I heard to the people that even in a different area they said well we we need an eighth messenger seven is a good number but eth is even better they said we got some we need some new idea about this they don't say it but their way that action proves their thought is some louder than their voice can pronounce and their way of their action the things that we do instead of seeking single-minded for God sent out the prophet the message that be Vindicated in this hour through and through there no other Vindication they're tired and sick and tired with the Simplicity of this message because they don't have a faith to make it a work they want to make it a word of a god become more fancier because they don't have the Revel they're not to change the 1200 message but they change their interpretation with their life about this messag that same spirit in heaven be cast it down to the Earth never die and they probably thinking why you have to uplifting this uh the Michael the god that all the time I want to go up to the north to set up on my own Throne to set up my own people to set up on my own idea I can make this work just as much as God can make it a work but God make it a work better Simplicity to believe his word the devil have a many thousands of a way to make the word seemingly work just as the same as what God make he can still get of the blessing he can still get to a miracle he can still by Believing by gift and by whatever can make the healing happen can go do all of that seemingly on the outskirt on the out surface just as much as the real believer is that but a cord of it is the Satan's spirit it's all started from the jealousy that he had and brother BR said he become the first one that had a Jealousy on Earth how he coming into the serpent and then from The Serpent and he passes his idea to Eve then that Eve give to the two two uh two child and that abble and kin and you find out that that spirit will never die and that happens unin he said now where did that jealousy come from he said where did that a murder come from where did all that kind of spirit of come from and out of Adam couldn't have come from Satan it's exactly where did he come from right and said now we find out he was the first murderer King and he was the first one to have a jealousy and Lucifer got the jealous of a Michael brought it right down to the Earth and transferred it into man and said Kim by taking on this evil took the first Mark God marked him no one was to kill him let let him alone but you remember soon as he marked him he went out from the presence of God when the jealousy started taking a hold of the the people that the person then it started went out from the presence of God they started having something of their own and they married a wife and the started a career and started the business and just a leave of the daily life but you see is because of the jealousy he want to have put his own idea what is his own idea to be pushed to force and that caus it all this fall as it happened but jealous it doesn't want to just to stay alone as a jealous do you find that that people they had a jealous usually they don't show it's all hide at a very deep please don't be quiet you make me thinking you have a jealous usually they hide it it very deep and they just try to use all different kind of a way try to make their idea more presentable and then people can see and when people have a jealous they will never stay alone just have a jealous because a jealous progress it will become a zealous but on the wrong way so when a person become a jealous you look at it this world it's a fall of them and why people you go on an Instagram if this person got a got go for a vacation they put all kinds of a poster on it and the other person just cannot handle it anymore you go Mexico I'm going to go to Hawaii nobody come to Texas though you do this I have to do that and then polish up their face almost you cannot recognize them and they had to beautify the filter to put a some many filtered on and when you look at is that who is that I remember one time with my wife and a one one girl that we used to know and uh and she was uh she came to my wife she said oh he said uh sister Tracy she said you know this is my uh graduation uh picture we got all all the students my wife's look at that and the girl said can you find me and said in on the phone my wife looking look she said where and she pointed she said that my wife said is that you they've been filter that so much you couldn't even recognize them well just because of this feel you know I don't look good I I I must be look as a certain certain star I must to be look at a have a fashion around like a certain certain people jealousy something hid it to deep it in there it just cannot handle somebody is look better than them they just cannot handle somebody can speak better than them they just can't handle somebody just have a nicer than them and they use all kinds of a way try to manipulate that so that it can getting better upper hand right but jealous making a person become a zealous and that's what a kin does and that's what he got inherited from his father when Devil's got a jealous he become a zealous and he want a zealous about his own program you find out that K when he was to become a jealous he become a zealous that jealousy will come into another the point they become a driven power that push it in him they becom so zealous that it wouldn't want God's idea he wouldn't want anybody can give him the uh give him a correction or give him instruction and even that voice was raise it up though there was a silent voice but that's a powerful voice because Abel got a revelation when Abel got a revelation though he doesn't speak one word it doesn't recall Abel got one word that had any talk with God but having many talk many words that again has a talk with God but when Abel when something was coming upon him and it's not his mom his daddy taught him and about it but he got a revelation it's not Apple because they under the old they're in they go through the same family they under the same tutorship of their mother and the father if they just by the tutorship they just by the teaching if they just by the the book on the Shelf if Justus about the teaching you this the teaching that try to reform a person and they should be on to the same level but thank God that Abel was on another level because God revealed attitude to him yeah it's not as a mom and daddy taught him young people it's not your mom and dad try to taught you taught you the message you must have a personal revelation from the Lord when you get a connected with him he become real to you then you become a consecrated then you become a sacrificial then you become a surrender s to him then you don't care what other people said you can sacrifice your whole life on the altar die is it Hallelujah but that jealousy become such a zealous power all right that a driven can he said if I can't if God can't receive my sacrifice as an apple or as a vegetables or flour I'm going to hush that voice The Voice are from the Revelation doesn't the Bible said that by Fai that Abel presented an offer to God and better than Ken has get by it and though he died yet he still speaking faith is a revelation Hallelujah without a revelation how you can get a faith without God himself a revealed to you how can you have a faith how can you give your life how can you surrender a whole being without a no reservation give your whole being to him not a one Speck of left in you that you're not giving to him and you're ready to die for the Revelation that the Lord had give it to you as Abel did that's was abble did but can that jealousy become of such a driven power to him that drive him and one day and he hes The Voice he killed his brother but you know what when the voice what is to become a revelation he had a voice that's come with it though he died but the the person the physical person it's died but the voice of a revelation never died it goes before God no matter how that they try to kill them they try to uh uh try to do everything they can doesn't have to be to kill physically and the people that they can kill that the person's of their reputation like the people in this earth that they try to do to the message and they try to uh degrade this message they try to uh said this message is wrong they try to find the fault that in the prophet and in the messenger they do everything they can but when that Revelation become a real that voice can never be killed and when you receive that voice into you not as a voice but as a voice that it didn't hear when God revealed to you though you die the Revelation voice will never die you Mom and said when you believe for your children sir it's not just by some teaching but by faith to the word of God believe under Jesus Christ that you and your house shall be saved when God make that it become a personal to you become a revelation to you though you die but that voice of revelation will never die and he will go before the Lord Lord will hear that that he will answer your prayer because thy voice can never be hared how many time you have till they all fell asleep when you fall in sleep I quit that voice of a revelation can never be hushed no matter is it from the outside or from the inside because that is from a revealed word and outside the devil we try to use a work we try to use a career we're try to use a beauty we try to use everything try to hush that voice but when you receive that when you're born again when it become a revelation to you is that something that is taught that voice can never be hushed on inside it can never be hushed it either your own mistake cannot hush that voice of Revelation your wrongdoing cannot hush that Revelation voice you're falling you're stumbling can that you said I made so many mistakes I done so many wrong but there's another voice inside our voice though you fall though you made a mistake though you weak but even yourself canot hares that voice because that voice is the voice of a revelation he will always Len it up because when God change you he's not just to change your mind he change your soul there's a predestinated aen in there so God has to reveal himself to you while you reveal himself to you to that Soul even when you fall even when you stumble even when you made a mistake but there was always the voice of a revealed word coming forth that Lord forgive [Applause] [Music] me you one over the message at a private interview brother brma talked to Sister Bruce many of you probably heard that that's the one message very short only a few minutes just before the Masterpiece and the sister Bruce has said to brother brand said to brother brand I made so many mistakes I've done so many wrong probably that's the same feeling that we feel I said so many things I shouldn't say I've done so many things I shouldn't do look at it what does the prophet say he said we got a blood sacrifice L there God don't even see it us he hears our voice he still hear you it's your voice it's your voice when you pray it's not a Jesus voice that has to pray it's your voice that is a pray is your voice when you say the cursed word to somebody else is your voice is to say the things that you shouldn't say that's the steal your voice said I never say in my mouth your thought is louder in heaven than on the earth that voice is your voice you can't deny it then he said he hear our voice but he sees the blood of Jesus Christ when we saw Roar connected with judgment when we saw we didn't made made a mistake connected with judgment from God lord vote unto me I done something wrong what am what I'm going to I'm going to miss the rapture we associate our wrongdoing with the legal side out of it but when you receive the voice of a revelation there's a blood still speaking loses your voice but in behind that voice there's a different life there's a different blood it's not a b c d oh but that blood of Jesus Christ the life of God living inside of you even before you have that life that see life already living inside of you but when you born again he wasn't manifested it out there's a blood Ste standing between you and God if there's no blood your voice will go before God no matter how righteous you are your voice is going to go before that and you are your voice and you are you said I live a holy life but your voice going to go before God without the blood your Holiness just like a rag without that blood judgment going to fall no matter how holy you are but with that blood in front of you there's a voice behind that voice when the voice of the human said I done wrong but when your voice that behind that voice said Lord I'm done wrong forgive me for that and that voice would Dr that voice that you done wrong put it in into the bleach and in the blood of Jesus Christ then there's another voice to come out Lord forgive them he sees the blood of a Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son is our voice I cannot deny that I done wrong that voice is go but it cannot filtered out out the blood of Jesus Christ is said then it's is said it's our voice but it's a Christ's blood then is a Christ that's talk through us to God so therefore we're no sinner no more how marvelous that is aren't you thankful to the bleeding bloody word that the Lord had given to us when you receive that voice you literally receive the life of Jesus Christ you receive that blood and now it's not your voice but that voice was speaking through you though you as filthy as you can be though you made a mistake as much as you can be but there is another voice behind that any human voice the wrong voice the wrong things that we do the wrong thought that we have but drop it into the blood of Jesus Christ then there is another voice and instead of our voice come com before God then God Associated your mistake to forgiveness then forgiveness to righteousness that righteousness means not you are forgiven but you never sin in the first place let me continue on we saw the jealousy that has uh negative a part of it but we know that anything that is uh what is on what is a negative there is a positive side of it devil is only the impersonator he can only impersonate there's nothing original about him everything he was just copy but there is a tress of another side of the jealousy God said my name is jealousy in the book of Exodus chapter 34 it said for Thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God he is an original jealous God but when jealous come as I said a jealous also means zealous if there was the right jealous then it become a Force it would driven a person that he become a very zealous and when you are you jealous about your wife you should if any man can flirt with your wife you say Ah that's fine you're not much out of a husband you don't love her if you do love her you're jealous for her yes and that jealousy become a zealous some man can touch my wife I was showed him a GLE no no I was show him AAL love first then I was showed him a gup hold Love by praying for a Deb man you have to because you are jealous about the one that you love love cannot be a true love without a jealousy and the zealous about it to believe God you must be jealous about what your God is doing he's the only one that you believe he's the only one you dedicate your life brother bman said if your life is not centered around Jesus Christ if he is not in a preeminence in your life he said remember you don't have the Holy Ghost if you have a holy spirit holy spirit is a jealous he jealous about you and you jealous about him he jealous about you so much he's jealous about everything that you have about a whole being that you have his Z us about where you go his Ze us about which church you're going to his Z is about which word you're listening to he jeal about which book you're reading at his zealous are about you because they love you that love is a love of a jealousy in book of a number I just want to save some time so you don't have to turn to it in chapter uh 5 and 12 he said speaking unto the children of Israel say unto them if any man's wife got aside go aside and commit trespass against him that means that his wife commit adultery doing something uh behind her husband and the number said and a man lie with her carnally and he be hide hid from the eyes of her husband that means her husbands didn't cut her and to be kept close he keep it very secret and nobody knows and she' be defiled but in reality she was defiled because she betrayed her marriage vow and there be no witness against her what does that mean on the outside you can't see it no witness she done is very sacredly and neither should be taken with the matter nobody find him on the spot find her on the spot of what she did this is talked about that a woman or we see there's a wife that had a husband she only got one husband but somehow she lost the singleness the Simplicity the loyalty that to her husband and she didn't get it caught she still goes to church she's still reading her Bible come on she's still cooking dinner for her husband she still say hallelujah she do everything just like the normal wife that do if I was say should we just bride still the bride the wife of Jesus Christ she still do everything that a Believer supposed to do she come to the church she paying her ties she reading the scripture reading the message listening the once a while and can talk a message believer talk can go fellowship with the believer but you know what her husband just found something something wrong somewhere I could not have pinpointed it but I failed it she used to love me very much when her husband to the word speaking tears run down her eye but she just recently the husband said I don't see that tear anymore she used to be when they talking about a word her eyes was lock into it but just recently I can see that a thousand yard stair she coming to the church she's sitting at the same Pew that she always sit but when the pastor or sorry the husband say something really harsh she's just pretending she's making notes she wouldn't straight eye eye to eye to her husband anymore her husband is a very sensitive and she said what's wrong with her she's not as she used to be and someday her husband had going home and quickly she put something behind her her husband look at that just got a little start on honey what you reading oh oh it's fine nothing just you know somebody wrote some romance article or something talk about love or this and that you know it would be better for our marriage life and a husband who doesn't say anything let her go but in the private time the husband started thinking something wrong somewhere she's not like what she used to be she still do her duty to her husband still every day say oh oh honey I love you but there's no feeling in it there's no dedication in it and her husband started to feel the deadness and she used to be very outspoken talk about the word of a God but a word of a God in their family become rare even talking about it it seems as there is no Warmness that she that he always felt it it before and on the surface as the scripture said you cannot say anything wrong about her she's still dressed long skirt she still has her long hair and she's doing everything just like every everybody else as the Believers is doing but her husband is very sensitive a husband and he start to find during the service she used to say Amen all the time but she do say that anymore she used to live up their hands when he speaking about Lord Jesus and then the tear run down and sometimes she even run she even run out of her seat and go on start worshiping the Lord but now her husband doesn't see that anymore and her husband saw her she spent more time on a CNN the Fox News than a message of this hour she spend more time on shopping online shopping or Instagram or Facebook or this and that she spend more time on that and sometime her husband try to rebuke her that about and she give that a staring eye to her husband of course right away she oh no I shouldn't do that but in the inside of the inside something went wrong her husband realized something different and her husband start to seeing she go to the shower all the time one shower is enough two shower is extra but when he saw her going to the shower three four times a day her husband said something goes wrong here let's turn to the camera to this a little lady here I can see that her tears start running down when she taking shower oh God I lost my first love oh Lord you used to be want my husband to touch me oh I feel love that she he give it to me used to be when my husband is speaking the loving word to me oh my heart just melted but there is another Slicker got my attention I W astray I go for him I fall into the Trap I commit adulterate wisdom and he tried to use she tried to use her own Works try to solve the problem she scrub she scrub and she the reason she feel defiled she feel unlean she know she done wrong and she used all kinds of soap and she went to the shower she used the Baptist soap he used the Methodist soap he used the Pentecostal soap and his scrub scrub it he tried to scrub his skin off even but wouldn't get her clean and she go try to try the psychology she try the psych doctor she try to this book and that book that 12 step to the success of marriage that 12 step to this and that she try to scrub and scrub and scrub because she feel defiled but she wouldn't get herself a clean she needed something way powerful than a Baptist scrub than a Methodist scrub she needed something else and she couldn't do it no matter how she tried am I talking about you and the next verse of 5 and 14 it said and a spirit of a jealousy come upon him that is her husband and he be jealous of as his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and should be not defiled is that how much this woman tried to get read of the defilement that she had the job is laid in her husband the Bible said that the spirit of jealousy was upon him no matter how she tried but no matter how tried how many times today she tried to be clean she tried to be holy she tried to get rid of the the guilty feeling the condemnation but it doesn't l in her she cannot do it but he take that her husband who the spirit of jealousy upon him it's not that the spirit of jealousy upon her but it's a spirit upon spirit of jealousy upon upon her husband when her husband saw there's a need is her husband must become under the sin to do the rescue is her husband must be on the sin to do the Redemption work the church there's a church church church and they try to give this psychology they try to use this method but never going to work until God the hos are coming down it takes him yes to do the Redemption work it take him to be a personal God that to the people he take it himself not just to teaching his bride how to behave herself how to do this how to do that he taking him coming down as the hasip because as a husband he is the head if he's the head he must have take take the responsibility no other can take the responsibility the wife cannot take the responsibility but a husand must have taken a responsibility is in this last hour what we have to the message is God himself coming there when all the ages go to the age after age from the age from the epan age the per age the Philadelphia Age come to the Le age all age has been defiled and all the all those in this age those churches are denominated they only got a portion of the word and then it denominated on the justification then it denominated on the sanctification then it denominated on the gift of the Holy Ghost but in the last hour God said I'm going to come in down H there's no other cure there's no other remedy but a husband himself must have coming down I'm thinking about in all this age God sent to John said go write a letter to the angel of the Church of epici go write a letter to the Church of sardan go write a letter to the angel of the church of a Philadelphia go write a letter to the angel of the Church of the leod deia but when he come to the last hour but when he called the bride out of the Le DEA as the brother said this is the bright age and in the Book of Revelation chapter 10 and seven it said in the days of the voice of the seven messenger the seventh angel he said I will come down and speak to them in all this age it's just writing a letter writing a letter and writing a letter but when it come to the last of the age they said JN don't write a letter [Music] anymore oh yes Lord it said I saw another Mighty angel coming down from heaven closed the with of cloud and a rimo is upon his head and is a face as a wore the Sun and is a feet as a pillar of fire and he had in his book in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and it's a left foot on the earth and it cried with a loud voice as one a lion roarers when Lon roarers All Things become silent when lion roar bucks even become silent they keep quiet we only got a white Ro in this day that is the message of this hour the line of a tribe of Judah has a coming down when he wor all the denomination voice ceased Hallelujah said when the line War when he had cried seven Thunder utters their voices all the Mist there the end that Thunder the first seal the second seal until the seven all the seal that was secret the S mystery is all revealed in the Thunders and when the s a voice I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me think about it John had to write all this letter to the first age second age third fourth fifth sixth seventh when all their Church ages is over but there's a bride age there's a calling out of the bride and John heard Thunders roaring seals opening Christ is the mystery of a God is revealed a token is there the things that are to be there John have never saw something like that he heard that the thers Roaring and he about to Rite that The Voice I said doing right he said sealed it up seal those things which the seven son Des Ed and Rise them not oh I was thinking John was thinking Lord this is every mystery is going to be revealed this is everything Lord I wrote the letter to all the churches why not this and John saw all what we are reading at today John saw all that God has revealed and it was about to write but the Lord said seal it up John you have done your part but this is my part to do you don't need to write anymore you don't need to write a letter to the church agents anymore they're all going to be denominated but in the last hour is that I'm going to com in down I'm going to coming down reveal my own self to the seventh messenger in the day of the voice of the seven message time shall be no more I will come down there's no need to write a letter anymore that denominated in the letter the letter kills but the spirit will make them live I said don't write it this is a man's job and I'm going to come in there in the day of the voice of Seven's Angel he said I'm going to coming down to reveal my own self who can he reveal but to his own bride and then you can take the book and then you can e the book and then you can prophesy that again because in the last of age in the last of time is a headship coming back is a husband coming back the bride has been defiled they've been denominated from a church to church church church bride bride bride bride but there must be a true one there must be a real one it's not in their own Holiness but in my righteousness I'm going to make them holy I'm going to make them righteous I'm going to clean them up God had forbidden John to write all of them but it reveal and his allation to tell us your headship is coming back to be United with is bride body because as the headship is taking the responsibility is it a headship to claim her up is her husband to do all the Redemption work I thinking about it in the book of Hosea the Lord ask Hosea said to marry a whoredom to take her how many heads of this whoredom has had how many head of is a harlot has already had he got all kinds of seed at the inside of her and she got all kind kind of head that is supposed to be her head but none of them is her head the Lord tell the prophet of Hosea said you go marry her you become her head you lead her not that all kinds of a men's idea to Leading her but you Prophet will be my representative and you bring that headship back to that woman and she's under a new headship because she's under a new headship all her past can be right it off all her G it doesn't matter she was a prostitute or hard but her headship changed it's not a denomination church headship not a man's idea headship but God himself through the prophet messenger become her head remember her body is still prostitute body she's still as filthy as she can be her past still in the record that on the book when people saw her they still see she's a whoredom when people saw her she's a prostitute but thank God her headship tanged when the head changed then the whole being was changed then when the head United with the body no matter how weak we are but we're head United with the body it take her to the Heavenly Place she's as holy as he can be because her headship now taking the responsibility the Bible said as she conceived and bared a daughter and God said unto her him called her name l l l for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel but I will utterly take them away now when she win the l h she conceive and bear a son then said God called his name loami for ye are not my people and I will not be your God what a hopeless helpless estate that is woman's at that but thank God is said yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and he shall come to pass that in the place where he was said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the Living God in the place that they were called you not my children you done things that the wrong but in the same place when the has sheep coming back and he said you are my son you are my wife you are my bride the Airship has a change when you United with the headship in his hour when a cloud was sh up on the Arizona sky it shows to us the headship is coming back and is united with the bride that in this hour is said in the place that you were said no mercy but in that same place that said you're the Son and Daughter of the Living God in the place that were you said I was sick but in that same place that he said I'm your healer in that place that call you are adulter but in the same place the redeeming power coming down said that you are an unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ the headship has coming back why because he is a Jehovah Shema if he is a Jehovah Shema then Ezekiel 4835 that means the Lord is there where in that City the name shall be called the Lord is there the C is the New Jerusalem it's the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not that you will be but he said I put my name in you and my name is Jehovah shemi and I will be in you I will be in you I will be there it's not I will be there but my name is I'll be there in the same place that you called a daughter but that my name is in there I a Jehovah Shem if I a Jehovah Shem that means I'm the Lord the present God that means wherever you are God is there in your difficulty he said Jehovah sh the H is there in your trials he said I'll be there and your difficult situation that you seem there's no hope he said my name is a Jehovah sh I put my name there if he is a Jehovah Gyra he must be Jehovah Shima what could to do to us if Jehovah Gyra is only was what could to do to us if Jehovah Tak the two is just was but I make sure in the Book of Ezekiel 48 the last one name of a God is said in my name is the Jehovah Shema I will be there I'm not just the past tense but I will always be I'm the god that Health me I'm Jehovah sh I heal you before I heal you now I will heal you in [Applause] future thank you Lord the headship is coming back because he's a jealousy about his own bride that's make him become zealous about his own bride God is a jealous God brother Bram said he's a jealous and in one his wife a pure he wants her a virgin chased nothing in the world into her at all all together is the word part of him we must be a part of the word not a part of the crade a part of the word and not a part of the church a part of the Bride church is a condemned we know that she goes to outer Darkness but a bride goes up Hallelujah Lord I don't want him to be like like the rest of the world I'm jealous of them aren't you thankful we have a prophet that are representing the Lord is that I'm jealous is that a prophet or is it God himself saying I'm jealous about you I want them to be real Christian I want them to look like it act like it and be like it and be genuine and that's the reason I'm zealous of my brethren I don't want them off in the little old Social Gospel just like you get out of some incubator out here I want them to be real man of a god stand and not compromise on that word and really let it out [Music] there that's why God s is a prophet that's why he sended a messenger and in beyond the curtain of a Time brother BR said if that was the true on that day he said Jesus will come to you and you will present us to him a chased version judg the by the word that you preached to them then a voice RIS it up said if you haven't been go if you haven't went we won't be here how we thankful there is a faithful servant just like a Paul that I'm jealous I want to present God a Chase diversion and he fulfills that that's why we are zealous if God is a zealous and jealousy to his a bride and he sented a prophet jealous and zealous about God's bride we must be zealous amen it's not a we must there's a zealous right inside of you you just need to be inspired you just need to realize who you are and what is in you not just a little church right not just us 400 and no more there's way way beyond that if I preach to you just what Paul preached to brother Bram said to his church and his groups get in ours will too cuz we got to the same thing and he has it the same zealous same gospel if it is a message is the true and we are zealous we are jealous about the word of God that's why we translate that's why by the God by the grace of God in this year April

heard he's zealous about his a bride and he done the phenomenal work for his bride what is our duty let me finish here then a book of a number said then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the T part of a NAA of a barly male he shall pour no oil upon it nor put a frankincense there on for it is an offering of a jealousy an offering of a m burning iniquity to remembrance and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the Lord and the priest shall take the holy water in an Earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the Tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water it's a holy water in an earn vessel and then take the dust and put it in an ear Earthen vessel and making it become a bitter water let's talk about a Christ Christ is the Earthen vessel and then Christ the holy water what is the holy the word of God he is the word of God the holy water in a ursen vessel and then the dust of the floor because of that means it's a cursed Christ become a curse for us and then put that dust into that Earthen vessel with the holy water then it become a bitter cup that our husband the priest that our high priest he tastes the bitter cup and he bear our iniquity because he's a husband he's a jealous about his bride his bride is a hopeless and helpless but he said I become a sacrifice for them then the priest shall bring that and then when a priest that let me pass it over here I'm just try to finish it over here and then the priest there charged the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say it unto the woman the Lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the Lord doesn't make thy thigh to rot and belly to swell and this water that calls the curse shall go into thy bows to make thy belly to swell and th thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen no matter what God's word said you must say amen amen amen the Lord said you said I'm amen amen amen if the word to take your hide off amen amen amen Lord I done wrong amen amen amen but when you say Amen to God's word when you confess God's word then first John said if we see that we have no sin we make him a liar and his word is not in us but if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sin and to cleans us from all unrighteousness when you say amen amen do God's word no matter how hard it is no matter what El said but your word is the truth then your sins shall be forgiven listen and then the next verse the five and the 24 is in number and the priest shall write this curse in the book the priest pick up a P he said uh I commit adultery the PRI put that on the book that's a curse and you done it not wrong the priest write it down he write all the cursed word cursed to those that are sin stand against the Lord and praise to write down Every curse that in the book and he shall blow them with the bitter water what is doing there is a holy water in an earth and vessel and there's a dust that in that Earth and vessel though is a bitter water but still it's a holy water though there's a Earthen vessel but there's a holy word inside that vessel and then with all the curses on that the priest shall take the water and start to wash the book of curse and I can imagine as that woman look at that curse he said I've done wrong I have no hope I'm a helpless I committed adultery I was devoured I was done so many things that that is wrong but her husband has made an offer for her and then the priest take the water start to wash that book and I can imagine that woman look at that a curse start to fading away start to fading away and feding away all that curse dripp it into that bitter water and all your Curse God by Christ the blood of Jesus Christ has washed away all the curse The Book of Life becoming the Lamb's Book of Life because it's the blood has washed you [Applause] and then the priest were presented of the beer cup yes sir to the woman said you must have drink it you said oh there's a curse but don't be afraid his blood has a blotted out every thing that's written against us it's all been washed in this a blood of that bitter cup Jesus said that the cup that I drink shall you drink it also but don't worry my blood has washed is the cff and that woman will start her drinking the cup though is a bitter water but there's a holy water that in that Earth and vessel all her sin will be forgiven the Bible the end of the book of the numbers said if this woman is not defiled and she shall conceive seed the devil said no you are defiled but my husband had made a sacrifice for me the devil said you done wrong but my husband has become a sacrifice for me his blood has washed away all my sin Amen brother BR said but God sent down from Heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son that when hour confessed the sin drops into God's bleach try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediator and down through the time until the H accuser Satan and lays on him till the day of judgment then he said he said you never done that in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God coming down himself and took your place in a form of a son of a God Jesus Christ and to wash you by the water of the washing of the Water by the word the word not a denomination the word will wash you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you're going to be washed it said the forgive it said therefore being justified by faith the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven he said but the word of Justified as though you've never done it he said in God's book of the seed of forgetfulness your old book of marriage is the divorced and dead it said that you are Justified it was accused he said you was accused so you never done that in the first place he a bridegroom and bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in as a bride before the foundation of the world am the Bible says so you are the predestinated seed brother BR said you were turned back into a virgin why you turned back into the Virgin so that you can conceive the seed it justify you as if you never Sinn in the first place and he said the devil said no he's a cursed her belly is a swell they said no that's a different sign yes sir that's a not sign sign of a curse that is a sign when I drink to the bitter cup as Jesus Christ has made himself a sacrifice I give myself I lay myself on an altar that blood has a drop it inside of me that's a swell of a pregnancy you've been turned into the Virgin and you can conceive the seed of God you can live a life of Jesus Christ may the Lord will bless you I I won't be able to talk very long I I hope I don't cough but jealousy causes jealousy it turns you into a zealot and it just makes that Great Commission come alive in us going into all the world and preach the gospel you shall do these things these signs and these wonders in my name and you you see that that he who has been forgiven much loves much that building there is because I'm zealous and jealous of you this building here is because there's someone that's zealous and loves because there was somebody that was zealous of me when I was that woman that had so failed isn't that all all of you isn't that all of us we've had a God that loved us a God that was zealous of us a God that went and found us and sought us out brother Matt when we were just no way to even find our way to him he came and found us amen and when when we were unworthy he became our righteousness through everything in the sea of forgetfulness and started us all over that we could bear the word of God and the word of God could come to life in us you know they talked about all these sentences that were written and all those things and and we can't go to all those places and reach all those people but I can say There's 7 million people in Dallas Fort Worth that you can talk to that you can give books to that you can do a work for that you can really show and the prophet of God said that every person deserves the right to hear the gospel at least once so I I hope that we here tonight and um when I thought in my heart of these meetings and I thought Lord what what is um my desire and what is the theme of the meeting and it just came to my heart you know Lord show us the way you know show us the father show us the way what way should we go what direction should we go go in what what path should our lives take there's so much confusion there's so much fussing in the message is dividing up into different camps and and it it's just such absolutely Church splits after church splits and movement starting and people calling themselves under and I just pulled away and I thought Lord which direction should I go and it just hit me just so simply going into all the world and preach the gospel let your light so shine among men that your good works might glorify your father in Heaven let eat the word of God with singleness of heart work out your own salvation with fear and tremble keep the gospel simple keep it in your life live it and let your life light shine that your good works might glorify the father above that Satan has come in and beguiled you or taken you away from the Simplicity of the Gospel that's where God's hid and I I believe if we could just hear what the spirit of God is saying to to us get back on track get back on fire apply the token to your hearts to your lives to your mind fall back in love with God Amen make contact with your Bible even when brother George was with us read your Bible pray read the message get back to being zealous get back to being on fire and and watch the joy of the Lord and the peace that surpasseth understanding boil over in your life cuz we have to be blind not to think that this world's Fallen apart I mean it is absolutely going nowhere and the world's looking for a hope and they're looking for a path and they're looking for somebody to show them the way and Jesus says I am the way the truth the life no man comes un the father but by me and you know that way cuz that way is in you I think it's important that we get back to what it was that we were commissioned to to do in the first place and I don't want to be a scholar of this message I want to live the word of God so God bless you tonight this giv our our our hearts swell up in us take these words and let them soap deep into yourself and use the word of God that brother Murphy shared with us tonight to examine your life and see what way are you going what is the end of your way for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus the Simplicity of the word of God never fails never fails so we just ask guys there we know there's many many sick in our church uh both our musicians are sick and brother Billy's sick and all that and and and I've been ill for the last three weeks and but I'm glad I'm not in my own hands amen and I'm glad that nothing can pluck me out of the palm of his hand amen so if I have to I'll go down preaching the gospel with a cough you know what I mean but I like talking about them don't you so Lord bless you tonight let's stand together I ask brother Matthew to come lead us in a few songs tomorrow night at 6 o00 let's think of what's been said tonight let's this word of God grow and brother Michael will be preaching to us tomorrow night 6 o'clock if you can all all be here
