[54:01] morning certainly do thank you musicians
[54:04] this morning if you have your Bibles
[54:06] let's turn over to the gospel of St
[54:10] Luke and we want to read uh the second
[54:13] chapter of Luke starting with the eth uh
[54:18] uh verse and read a few scriptures you
[54:22] know I I uh
[54:25] I always enjoy when somebody announces
[54:29] the birth of a baby they always want to
[54:32] tell how much it weighs and and you know
[54:35] how long it was and all that well you
[54:37] know I one day I just a long time ago I
[54:40] said that you know why you know I was
[54:42] talking to lesie I says you know why do
[54:44] they make such a big deal about how big
[54:47] it is and how long it is and everything
[54:49] and she looks at me she says well what
[54:52] do you do when you catch a
[54:54] fish
[54:58] you're always telling everybody how big
[55:00] it is and how much it weighs and how
[55:03] long it is well I tell you she got me
[55:05] there right so sisters
[55:08] congratulations that's all I can say I I
[55:11] understood then what a feat that it is
[55:14] you know we'll never understand that
[55:17] sisters but without you none of us would
[55:19] have been here so that's how important
[55:22] you are to the Lord so
[55:25] uh I just thought if any other brothers
[55:27] ever had the that question you might as
[55:30] well put it to rest right now you love
[55:34] them this
[55:34] morning amen amen I just thought with
[55:38] our little Christmas program I'd maybe
[55:40] try to have a Christmas message this
[55:43] morning
[55:45] uh God is certainly good to us amen just
[55:49] to think that he came is marvelous but
[55:53] let us just read these scriptures and
[55:56] and uh I I love those uh songs Christmas
[56:00] songs people you know
[56:03] they be because of the world has taken
[56:07] Christmas and turned it into a Santa
[56:10] Claus I'm not going to let their
[56:12] perversion rob me of my
[56:15] joy you know what I mean I I I I want
[56:19] the joy of the Lord to be my portion so
[56:23] there there there's no need let and all
[56:25] the commercial side of it and all that
[56:28] keep it's a time I love it's a time
[56:31] people are friendly one to another it's
[56:33] a time that people do good things and
[56:36] they give and and never say stop
[56:40] anything from good from happening you
[56:43] know always good things produce good
[56:45] things so I'm happy for this time of
[56:48] year amen and it says and there were in
[56:52] the same we know the beginning of the
[56:54] story that King uh that Caesar Augusto
[56:58] wanted to collect taxes and he was sent
[57:02] a decree that everybody should return to
[57:04] the town where he was born he was taking
[57:07] a great census he wanted to keep track
[57:10] of all the people uh all his Fame and
[57:14] Fortune and what he was worth and uh he
[57:18] didn't realize he was worth nothing but
[57:20] uh and so he he made the decree and we
[57:23] know that Joseph and Mary went to
[57:27] Bethlehem and they could find no room in
[57:30] the end and so that he ended up in a
[57:33] manger and uh and um and then we pick up
[57:38] the story he says and she brought forth
[57:41] her firstborn son and wrapped him in
[57:44] swaddle clothes and laid him in a Manger
[57:48] because there was no
[57:50] room for them in the in
[57:56] there's hardly any room for him in the
[57:57] world
[58:00] anymore and there were in the same
[58:02] country shepherds abiding in the
[58:06] field keeping watch over their flock by
[58:10] night and lo the angel of the Lord come
[58:14] unto them and the glory of the Lord
[58:18] Shone round about them and they were
[58:21] sore afraid and the angel said unto them
[58:26] fear not for behold I bring you good
[58:30] tidings of great joy which shall be to
[58:35] all
[58:37] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[58:40] the city of David his savior which is
[58:44] Christ the lord and this shall be a sign
[58:49] unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped
[58:53] in swaddle in clothes lying in a manger
[58:58] and suddenly there was with the angels a
[59:02] multitude of heavenly hosts praising God
[59:06] and saying glory to God in the highest
[59:10] and on Earth peace Good Will toward men
[59:16] and it came to pass as the Angels were
[59:18] gone away from them unto Heaven the
[59:23] shepherd said one to another let us now
[59:27] go even unto Bethlehem and and found
[59:31] Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in
[59:35] the
[59:36] manger and when they had seen it they
[59:39] made known abroad the same which was
[59:43] told them concerning this child and all
[59:48] they that heard it wondered at those
[59:52] things which were told them by the
[59:55] Shepherds Heavenly Father we ask you to
[59:58] bless your word just this morning in
[1:00:00] Jesus precious name we pray amen God
[1:00:04] bless you may be
[1:00:13] seated what a
[1:00:17] uh tremendous event I I could certainly
[1:00:21] beyond the shadow of a doubt say with
[1:00:24] confidence in my heart that was probably
[1:00:26] the greatest historical event that had
[1:00:28] taken place up to that
[1:00:30] time amen possibly the greatest
[1:00:34] historical
[1:00:35] event that has taken place I would say
[1:00:40] probably next to the
[1:00:42] Resurrection The Coming of a savior into
[1:00:47] the
[1:00:47] world and we we as we follow this story
[1:00:52] and we talk about the shepherd words and
[1:00:55] what was transpiring all these great
[1:00:58] things took place but yet so
[1:01:01] few people even recognized it or saw it
[1:01:07] even though there were
[1:01:09] signs and you know that God gives signs
[1:01:14] he gives signs to uh to attract the
[1:01:17] people he give signs that people can to
[1:01:21] to know what is coming because with
[1:01:25] every sign there's a voice that follows
[1:01:29] the sign in other words there's a
[1:01:31] message behind the sign uh like even a
[1:01:36] road sign a sign is given to attract the
[1:01:40] attention of the people you're driving
[1:01:43] down the road and you see that sign that
[1:01:45] sits on the side of the road and it
[1:01:48] it'll be a a swervy sign sort of looks
[1:01:51] like a little snake now that's the sign
[1:01:54] that to catch your attention but the
[1:01:56] voice behind that sign is there's a
[1:02:00] curvy road ahead slow down else you will
[1:02:04] find yourself in the ditch so the sign
[1:02:08] was to attract your attention but there
[1:02:10] was a voice behind the sign or if I
[1:02:13] could use the instead of maybe the word
[1:02:16] voice uh another words a sign is trying
[1:02:19] to tell you something that's why we say
[1:02:22] a voice that's what a voice does a voice
[1:02:25] cries out to try to tell you something
[1:02:28] it's trying to get to you a message it's
[1:02:30] trying to attract your attention to
[1:02:33] something that is happening or is fixing
[1:02:37] to happen uh it it doesn't want you to
[1:02:40] ignore the signs because ignoring the
[1:02:44] sign is going to uh bring the judgments
[1:02:49] of the warning of the voice in other
[1:02:52] words a stop sign it tells you to stop
[1:02:55] you know the that that's the the sign to
[1:02:58] attract your attention to stop the voice
[1:03:01] behind that sign is that there's there
[1:03:03] will be oncoming traffic or or that you
[1:03:07] have to uh give way to something else
[1:03:11] and so if you if you totally ignore that
[1:03:14] sign and you don't hear the message that
[1:03:18] that sign is giving you you will end up
[1:03:22] with the judgment of that
[1:03:26] sign so that sign has a reason in other
[1:03:30] words it's trying to reach you and you
[1:03:32] notice that when you uh are driving that
[1:03:37] nobody else in the car is
[1:03:40] responsible they might feel the
[1:03:46] result of you not
[1:03:49] keeping the advice or the message of the
[1:03:53] sign
[1:03:54] but you're responsible for the sign so
[1:03:58] you're individually
[1:04:00] responsible for seeing the
[1:04:04] sign obeying the
[1:04:07] sign and hearing the voice behind the
[1:04:10] sign you can't pass that off onto
[1:04:14] somebody else you can't say well let's
[1:04:16] turn to the back seat you know and say
[1:04:20] well why didn't you tell
[1:04:22] me because you took the
[1:04:26] responsibility of sitting in the
[1:04:28] driver's seat you took the
[1:04:31] responsibility
[1:04:32] of of of starting and that car up and
[1:04:36] moving that car down the road and along
[1:04:40] with that you have a
[1:04:42] responsibility and you're obl obligated
[1:04:45] to that responsibility you get in a
[1:04:48] wreck and and they're not going to
[1:04:50] ticket the backseat
[1:04:53] driver
[1:04:55] I mean I've had a lot of backseat
[1:04:56] drivers I'd like to have ticketed
[1:04:59] but uh they're not going to ticket the
[1:05:02] backseat driver
[1:05:04] right they're not going to ticket the
[1:05:07] passenger but you've got to Bear the
[1:05:11] responsibility of that and so this
[1:05:14] morning we have to understand it's an
[1:05:17] individual
[1:05:18] Affair you've got to Bear the the the
[1:05:22] responsibility of the the decision that
[1:05:26] you made to
[1:05:28] drive and and we have to bear the
[1:05:30] responsibility of the decision that
[1:05:33] we've made to identify ourselves with
[1:05:36] the gospel amen you know you just can't
[1:05:40] say that you're a Christian and then
[1:05:43] ignore the word of God there's a
[1:05:46] responsibility that comes with with
[1:05:50] carrying the license if I could say that
[1:05:54] a of a Christian right you know it's it
[1:05:57] it's better uh uh not even to profess it
[1:06:02] the prophet of God and describing the
[1:06:04] woman at the well she said she knew the
[1:06:06] word but she wasn't living
[1:06:08] it she knew
[1:06:11] it but she wasn't living it therefore
[1:06:14] she didn't make the POS profession as if
[1:06:17] she was living it she had a lot of
[1:06:20] hidden
[1:06:21] character and so we we understand that
[1:06:24] it knowing
[1:06:26] that that God gives signs and he tries
[1:06:29] to give a sign so
[1:06:32] that the people uh will will it'll
[1:06:36] attract their attention and and bring to
[1:06:39] them the
[1:06:40] realization that there's something that
[1:06:43] they should be looking for that's right
[1:06:47] amen so when you pull to a stop sign
[1:06:49] what do you do you look for oncoming
[1:06:51] traffic you you it it it brings you into
[1:06:54] a a a in heighted uh
[1:06:59] awareness of the the
[1:07:02] circumstances are different than they
[1:07:04] were just immediately before you got the
[1:07:09] sign right so you understand that God
[1:07:12] gives signs and the sign is to create
[1:07:16] within you a reaction is to create
[1:07:20] within you an understanding it's to
[1:07:23] create within you an awareness it it it
[1:07:27] it's a signs are gifts of God to his
[1:07:31] people that's right and so we find out
[1:07:33] in the scripture that that the people in
[1:07:37] that day those Shepherds and all those
[1:07:39] people were living in the day of of the
[1:07:44] Fulfillment of a
[1:07:47] sign now whether they understood it or
[1:07:50] not or recognized it or not what
[1:07:53] depended a lot on what they took heed
[1:07:56] to but so we find out that those angels
[1:07:59] were a sign they showed up in the
[1:08:02] heavens and they begin to speak to the
[1:08:05] those Shepherds and they said this will
[1:08:08] be a sign to you you'll go to this place
[1:08:11] and find a baby in a Manger now that in
[1:08:15] itself was extremely unusual
[1:08:19] yes but that there was no place for that
[1:08:23] baby to be born because scripture had to
[1:08:26] be fulfilled amen the word of God was
[1:08:30] coming to pass whether or not anybody
[1:08:33] was aware of it or not but the sign to
[1:08:37] the Shepherds made them aware of it amen
[1:08:40] and they went and they found it just as
[1:08:43] the word of God said that it would be
[1:08:46] how many things today do we find just
[1:08:50] the same as the word of God said that
[1:08:53] they would be that's
[1:08:55] right and so we find out that these wise
[1:08:58] men were a sign that these Angels were a
[1:09:01] sign and they went and we find out that
[1:09:05] that this sign these Shepherds were
[1:09:07] moved
[1:09:09] upon and they went and found it as the
[1:09:13] angel
[1:09:14] said and they they put it
[1:09:17] abroad throughout all the
[1:09:20] country and all that heard it wondered
[1:09:24] but just
[1:09:26] think how many of them looked how many
[1:09:30] of them stayed with it how many were
[1:09:32] wondering what was this what with I
[1:09:34] wonder how many made
[1:09:36] inquiry uh of what took place they were
[1:09:40] living in the day of the Fulfillment of
[1:09:45] the sign they were actually living under
[1:09:49] the Fulfillment of Prophecy and were
[1:09:53] unaware Ware of what was transpiring
[1:09:56] right around them the Savior God himself
[1:10:00] had come down from heaven created a body
[1:10:05] and now was living with men so that he
[1:10:09] he could that he could uh actually uh
[1:10:13] could be a high priest that could be
[1:10:15] touched by the feelings of our
[1:10:19] infirmity that that we could have a
[1:10:22] Kinsman Redeemer someone that knows what
[1:10:26] it's like to be tempted in every way
[1:10:28] that you are tempted how many times do
[1:10:31] we go to the Lord I I was just thinking
[1:10:34] about it in my office you know all the
[1:10:36] things that are wrong with me and all
[1:10:39] the things I want to change and and you
[1:10:41] know I'm Irish so I'm a little
[1:10:44] hot-headed and and all my nature that I
[1:10:47] want to be different and I just struck
[1:10:49] me this morning that you know what uh
[1:10:53] he's a high
[1:10:55] priest that but these infirmities that I
[1:10:58] feel he can be touched by
[1:11:01] them yes my weaknesses my my failures in
[1:11:05] my flesh he can be touched by those
[1:11:08] things he he he knows what it feels
[1:11:14] like he knows what it feel like to have
[1:11:17] the the pull of the of the uh of the
[1:11:22] Flesh and the the the uh the women of
[1:11:26] the world and all that pull and and and
[1:11:29] the pull of of riches and wealth and the
[1:11:33] pull of wanting to to be in style all
[1:11:38] those things he he felt those things he
[1:11:40] fought those things he he wared against
[1:11:43] those things he had that same battle in
[1:11:46] his flesh that that we
[1:11:49] have he was a Kinsman tempted in every
[1:11:54] manner as we were
[1:11:56] tempted I I thought how little do I
[1:12:00] approach
[1:12:02] him on those
[1:12:05] grounds how often do I go to him and
[1:12:09] instead of approaching him in in fear
[1:12:14] and and afraid of judgment go to him and
[1:12:18] just say Lord you know what I'm going
[1:12:21] through you know what it's like
[1:12:24] right and you overcame
[1:12:28] yes would you depart to me that
[1:12:31] overcoming Grace that overcoming power I
[1:12:36] don't want to live this way I don't want
[1:12:37] to live in sin I I I I don't I don't
[1:12:41] want to I I don't want to be drawn away
[1:12:45] by every by every uh thing that comes
[1:12:50] along and and it canot go to him like
[1:12:53] he's somebody that doesn't care but he's
[1:12:56] somebody that
[1:12:59] feels so we see these Great Signs the
[1:13:02] signs of the angels we saw the sign of
[1:13:05] the wise
[1:13:06] men he said we have seen his star so we
[1:13:10] know the gospel is written in heaven and
[1:13:12] these wise men come and they see a sign
[1:13:16] they see a star they know that the Earth
[1:13:19] is moving that all the plan of God and
[1:13:22] all the planets and all the heavens were
[1:13:26] testifying to what that God has done how
[1:13:30] many know God uses the Heavens to to
[1:13:33] testify of his word he used the eclipse
[1:13:36] of the moon and our day to testify of
[1:13:39] the church ages we we know that we have
[1:13:42] a god that is telling man constantly
[1:13:45] what is
[1:13:47] transpiring
[1:13:48] right but if man's not inclined to the
[1:13:52] sign if man's not interested in the sign
[1:13:55] if man comes to the place that they feel
[1:13:57] that uh uh that everybody else has to
[1:14:00] obey the sign uh uh and he
[1:14:06] doesn't it reminds me of the man that
[1:14:08] driving with one day and we come up to
[1:14:10] the street and and we had the right away
[1:14:13] and there's stop signs on both sides and
[1:14:15] he came up and he stopped I said what
[1:14:18] are you stopping for he saidwell my
[1:14:20] brother-in-law might be
[1:14:22] coming
[1:14:25] did that go over your
[1:14:28] head see lot not everybody wants to obey
[1:14:31] the
[1:14:32] rules but we don't measure ourselves we
[1:14:36] know there's a purpose so just think of
[1:14:39] these wise
[1:14:41] men these wise men came and they came
[1:14:44] into the City and they they they were a
[1:14:47] sign so here they show up at at herod's
[1:14:53] uh a a place and and we we we recognize
[1:14:58] something's going on there's something
[1:15:01] transpiring this thing is not
[1:15:04] transpiring without God letting the
[1:15:07] world know that it was
[1:15:10] happening I mean you take Anna and
[1:15:14] Simeon in Luke 2 and3 he grabs the baby
[1:15:18] and he holds it and he says Lord let thy
[1:15:20] servant depart in peace for I have seen
[1:15:23] the glory of the Lord well they the
[1:15:26] scripture said that Anna and him were
[1:15:29] daily in the
[1:15:31] temple don't you think they told
[1:15:34] everybody in the temple he's coming
[1:15:37] soon the Messiah is here I'm here I know
[1:15:41] it in my spirit any day now he's going
[1:15:44] to show up there was events transpiring
[1:15:48] and the people were walking by the signs
[1:15:51] every day and one day Anna and them
[1:15:54] weren't there no
[1:15:57] more the sign was in their
[1:16:00] midst and it had
[1:16:02] transpired and nobody got the
[1:16:05] message I'm sure that if the Shepherds
[1:16:09] had
[1:16:10] told and I'm sure if Anna and Simeon had
[1:16:13] told people should have
[1:16:16] known I want you to catch this morning
[1:16:21] how important it is
[1:16:24] to hear the
[1:16:25] voice of the
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:30] sign we find out in
[1:16:33] Matthew 2 and6 maybe they put that on
[1:16:36] the board and and
[1:16:42] uh and and just to look at it and and to
[1:16:46] uh it to me it's it strikes me uh when
[1:16:52] you you read this
[1:16:54] and and see this
[1:16:57] great thing that's that
[1:17:01] happened and it says in in Matthew so we
[1:17:05] know the wise men came and they they
[1:17:08] inquired of Jose of Herod they said
[1:17:11] where is he King of the
[1:17:14] Jews we have seen a star in the east and
[1:17:18] we've We've Come To Worship Him you
[1:17:21] think that would have lit him on
[1:17:24] fire
[1:17:26] wow
[1:17:28] uh he'd be moved by
[1:17:31] that no he said you go you go uh find
[1:17:36] them and worship then come back to
[1:17:38] me that I I might go worship him also
[1:17:43] and then he
[1:17:46] inquired of the of the priest and the
[1:17:49] scribes and the Pharisees concerning
[1:17:53] this thing which these wise men spoke
[1:17:57] of now can you talk about a
[1:18:01] sign and and and that and even
[1:18:05] investigating the
[1:18:07] sign knowing that the sign is true and
[1:18:11] then rejecting The Voice
[1:18:19] thereof we don't want to reject the
[1:18:22] voice
[1:18:24] of the
[1:18:25] sign and and so listen to this this is
[1:18:29] tragedy to
[1:18:31] me at its highest
[1:18:36] level and it
[1:18:39] said then Herod when he saw that he was
[1:18:43] mocked of the wise men was exceedingly
[1:18:47] wroth and set forth and slew all the
[1:18:51] children that were in
[1:18:54] Bethlehem and in the
[1:18:56] coast and in all the coast
[1:19:00] thereof from two years old and under
[1:19:04] according to the time which he had
[1:19:07] diligently re uh inquired of the wise
[1:19:14] men so he goes out and he kills all
[1:19:18] these children in
[1:19:21] Bethlehem you would think that someone
[1:19:24] would say why did this
[1:19:27] happen what was this what's going on
[1:19:31] here why are these events
[1:19:35] transpiring because they were living in
[1:19:38] the day of the Fulfillment of the
[1:19:43] prophecy the sign let them know that
[1:19:47] there was a prophecy being fulfilled and
[1:19:50] then you look at the prophecy and and
[1:19:53] the prophecy simply says this he says
[1:19:56] and then then was
[1:19:58] fulfilled that which was spoken by
[1:20:01] Jeremiah the prophet
[1:20:03] saying Rama was there a voice
[1:20:10] heard lamentation and weeping and great
[1:20:14] mourning Rachel weeping for her children
[1:20:19] and would not be comforted because they
[1:20:23] are
[1:20:27] not absolutely prophecy
[1:20:31] transpiring and nobody understood that
[1:20:34] was a
[1:20:36] sign now just take a moment to think
[1:20:40] that John the
[1:20:42] Baptist was a
[1:20:45] sign he was a sign and we know in Isaiah
[1:20:50] 43-5 it talks to us of the voice of one
[1:20:55] crying in the wilderness make straight
[1:20:58] the path make straight your your way
[1:21:01] that that uh that there was uh John was
[1:21:05] a sign and they inquired of John and he
[1:21:08] he said that I'm not even worthy to lose
[1:21:12] the sandals the one that is to follow me
[1:21:15] the voice that is to
[1:21:18] come you know I'm just the sign I'm the
[1:21:21] Forerunner Jesus even said he was the
[1:21:24] Forerunner he was the Fulfillment of Isa
[1:21:28] of Isaiah 40 and3 the voice of one
[1:21:31] crying in the wilderness and so we've
[1:21:34] seen all these signs let's just stop for
[1:21:36] a
[1:21:38] moment
[1:21:39] and knowing that they were signs and
[1:21:43] listening to the
[1:21:46] voice that followed those
[1:21:51] signs
[1:21:54] what a
[1:21:58] uh
[1:22:02] uh sign spoke of he spoke of one that is
[1:22:08] present with you and then we know that
[1:22:12] Jesus shows up at the at
[1:22:16] the banks of
[1:22:18] Jordan and there was another
[1:22:21] sign
[1:22:23] the dove like a pillar of fire
[1:22:26] descending upon him the spirit
[1:22:28] descending upon him like in the form of
[1:22:31] a dove and and and John says
[1:22:35] Behold the Lamb of
[1:22:39] God yeah the world ought have have taken
[1:22:43] it you know just because the world
[1:22:46] doesn't see the sign doesn't mean that
[1:22:50] you don't see it and you shouldn't take
[1:22:53] heed to the
[1:22:56] voice if everybody runs a stop sign I
[1:23:00] was driving with the gentleman the other
[1:23:02] day and he said to me he says I've never
[1:23:03] seen so many stop lights and stop signs
[1:23:07] ran like they're run
[1:23:09] nowadays and I says yeah since Co they
[1:23:12] don't stop
[1:23:16] you all you got to do is put a mask on
[1:23:18] and put a little sign on your window
[1:23:20] I've got Co
[1:23:23] they won't even ask for your driver's
[1:23:26] license no it's because nobody nobody
[1:23:29] hears the sign nobody adheres to the
[1:23:34] sign and there's no consequences for
[1:23:38] Law and and there's no there there's no
[1:23:42] judgment given for the law and there's
[1:23:44] no
[1:23:46] punishment given for the law we had a a
[1:23:50] a person here that burnt down a a a a
[1:23:53] Jack In The Box I think it was or
[1:23:55] something caught it on fire and they
[1:23:57] find them
[1:24:01] $500 well that's an invite to me for
[1:24:04] every arson in the country to go torch a
[1:24:07] Jack In The
[1:24:08] Box I'd pay 500 bucks to torch some
[1:24:11] place you know what I
[1:24:17] mean see you can't go by the crowd cuz
[1:24:22] when the crowd doesn't listen to the
[1:24:26] voice of the sign if everybody starts
[1:24:29] running stop signs and nobody's going to
[1:24:32] enforce it and everybody that doesn't
[1:24:34] mean that it gives everybody a right now
[1:24:37] no when the voice of the sign
[1:24:40] deteriorates the judgment will still
[1:24:43] come that's
[1:24:45] right and and so we find out that that
[1:24:49] they didn't hear they didn't hear this
[1:24:51] great
[1:24:53] this great sign and all of a sudden he
[1:24:56] shows
[1:24:59] up now he's his it's not going to go
[1:25:03] unheard
[1:25:05] of Jesus shows up at a
[1:25:10] feast a wedding
[1:25:12] Feast I believe it was in capernium if
[1:25:15] I'm not mistaken you could correct me if
[1:25:18] I'm I'm
[1:25:20] wrong and he's at this wedding feast and
[1:25:23] they run out of wine and and his mother
[1:25:28] says they've ran out of
[1:25:32] wine and he says woman and it's not in
[1:25:36] the contents that we would say it would
[1:25:38] it it would be a a respectful word for
[1:25:42] that almost like mother woman what is
[1:25:45] that to
[1:25:48] me and she says do whatever he ask you
[1:25:53] to
[1:25:54] do and he tells them what to do and they
[1:25:58] went and did
[1:25:59] it in fact it created such a
[1:26:03] store that they they wanted to know why
[1:26:06] did you save the best to last you don't
[1:26:10] think that people gave answers you don't
[1:26:12] think that the people that brought the
[1:26:14] water told the scriptures even begins to
[1:26:18] say that his Fame begin to spread abroad
[1:26:23] they knew that something was here that
[1:26:26] the voice of all those signs the voice
[1:26:30] of the wise men the voice of the
[1:26:32] Shepherds the voice of John the Baptist
[1:26:35] that voice was now sounding so every
[1:26:38] sign has a message that follows it so
[1:26:42] now the message of all those signs that
[1:26:45] they've heard about this child that was
[1:26:47] born the the why that these babies were
[1:26:50] slaughtered here he he
[1:26:53] is he's on the scene yes and the first
[1:26:57] thing he does is is he turns the water
[1:27:00] into wine oh if I wouldn't like to
[1:27:03] preach a sermon about water baptism
[1:27:06] turning into the stimulation of the Holy
[1:27:10] Ghost
[1:27:13] Hallelujah I'd like to go there right
[1:27:16] now but
[1:27:18] but so the the the there's there's a
[1:27:22] move
[1:27:24] on right and then if you if you uh uh
[1:27:28] you go down and read a little further in
[1:27:31] John uh 4 uh uh I think is I don't know
[1:27:35] if John 4 yeah 45 and 56 uh somewhere in
[1:27:40] in that place in the scriptures that
[1:27:42] there was a noble man that was at that
[1:27:46] feast and when he heard that Jesus was
[1:27:49] back in town he went to him and said my
[1:27:52] son lies at the point of
[1:27:55] death come pray for
[1:27:57] him and Jesus has a conversation with
[1:28:01] him and he said and he he's still
[1:28:05] persistent and Jesus doesn't go he says
[1:28:08] go your son's
[1:28:10] healed and the mo the nobl man went
[1:28:16] home
[1:28:18] and found his
[1:28:20] son just
[1:28:22] the
[1:28:23] same healed just the same as Jesus has
[1:28:28] spoken it that many scholars say that
[1:28:32] was the second miracle that Jesus
[1:28:35] recorded but let's look at this voice
[1:28:39] what is this
[1:28:41] message that Jesus is
[1:28:46] bringing the god that they
[1:28:51] feared the god that
[1:28:54] that would become angry with him and put
[1:28:58] him in
[1:29:00] captivity the god that would judge him
[1:29:03] when they rejected him the same God that
[1:29:06] protected them was now dwelling with
[1:29:12] them no longer was he a god far off
[1:29:15] right but he was a God that was now
[1:29:19] walking with them that could be handled
[1:29:21] and touched
[1:29:22] and seen right so the message wasn't
[1:29:26] that God was far away but the voice was
[1:29:29] that God is present with us right now
[1:29:32] right now present with us and and he
[1:29:35] begin to to to demonstrate what his
[1:29:40] voice to them was that the God that was
[1:29:43] a far off was now a God that was there
[1:29:47] that there was an exodus fixing to take
[1:29:50] place that man was now going to be able
[1:29:53] to come from under the fear of the law
[1:29:57] and the judgments of the law into a
[1:30:00] place of grace and mercy there was a
[1:30:04] great uh voice that was speaking out and
[1:30:07] a great message
[1:30:09] right he was a voice of all those signs
[1:30:15] and this voice of this sign had a
[1:30:17] message that the god of grace and mercy
[1:30:22] was
[1:30:23] there and Not only was it in word but he
[1:30:26] began to demonstrate it he began to show
[1:30:29] that now that you could that the God
[1:30:32] that was a far off right is now a god
[1:30:36] that is present that can be touched by
[1:30:39] your infirmities that you can feel his
[1:30:43] goodness that you can feel his presence
[1:30:46] that you can feel the things
[1:30:48] that that that you can can actually come
[1:30:52] in contact with them right that you
[1:30:55] didn't have to go through goats and
[1:30:57] bloods and doves and everything but his
[1:31:02] freedom and his power and his goodness
[1:31:06] was now available for all
[1:31:11] men now they could actually see the
[1:31:14] proof of it right you take the woman at
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] well what a terrible condition
[1:31:24] I mean written off right had to go get
[1:31:27] her water by
[1:31:28] herself married six
[1:31:33] times what what bad shape but what was
[1:31:37] the message the message was you could be
[1:31:40] in that bad shape and this God still
[1:31:44] loves you this God still forgives you
[1:31:48] this God is still there for you this God
[1:31:51] can deler you he can heal you he can
[1:31:54] make it
[1:31:57] right I know he he he was demonstrating
[1:32:01] that he went to probably somebody that
[1:32:03] was in terrible condition so everybody
[1:32:06] else that was ever in a terrible
[1:32:08] condition can know that this voice and
[1:32:12] this sign in this message was something
[1:32:15] they could
[1:32:19] receive there's no need to walk in your
[1:32:22] past that's
[1:32:24] right there's no need to paint black
[1:32:29] clouds over your
[1:32:31] life there's no need to do
[1:32:38] Penance so much of the world still in
[1:32:44] Catholicism they make themselves
[1:32:46] suffer for their
[1:32:50] sins Penance is a
[1:32:53] rejection of
[1:32:57] forgiveness Penance is the rejection of
[1:32:59] the price that's paid for
[1:33:01] you moping and crying and sinning and
[1:33:06] saying that is just to look to the Lord
[1:33:09] and say I don't believe what you
[1:33:13] did you might say oh I I I believe that
[1:33:17] he did it no you
[1:33:20] don't you don't believe believe it you
[1:33:23] do not believe that he wiped your slight
[1:33:25] clean you still want to feel guilty
[1:33:27] because you like to live under that
[1:33:29] guilt because that guilt now becomes a
[1:33:32] reason to continue in the sin that you
[1:33:39] enjoy it just becomes an
[1:33:43] excuse and so what does man do when
[1:33:45] people have that excuse and they want to
[1:33:48] continue they want to continue in their
[1:33:50] games they want to continue in the
[1:33:52] things that they do they want to
[1:33:54] continue in that stuff but yet they
[1:33:58] know they wrap themselves in
[1:34:04] religion they don't accept the message
[1:34:07] that you're
[1:34:09] free what did he tell her go and sin no
[1:34:13] more your sins which are many are
[1:34:17] forgiven what did she
[1:34:20] do she accepted
[1:34:23] it she she took the liberty of having
[1:34:27] all the failures of her life failed
[1:34:29] marriage failed
[1:34:31] family uh just absolutely in in terrible
[1:34:35] social standing and she accepted what
[1:34:39] that she said sir I perceive that you're
[1:34:42] a prophet he said I have living water
[1:34:45] that you know not of she says well how
[1:34:48] can you don't have nothing to draw with
[1:34:50] he says it's a hell spring that'll
[1:34:53] spring up within
[1:34:56] you not from the
[1:34:59] outside but from the
[1:35:01] inside too many people always are
[1:35:04] looking off for God to do something out
[1:35:06] there change the world around him God
[1:35:09] changes the
[1:35:13] inside start right in your heart yes
[1:35:18] look at your own
[1:35:20] heart
[1:35:22] if you love the world and the things of
[1:35:24] the world the love of gods isn't in
[1:35:28] there but if you hate the
[1:35:30] world and you hate the way that you
[1:35:34] are and something in your
[1:35:39] heart she wanted to hear those words she
[1:35:43] couldn't find a way out
[1:35:46] right but the voice
[1:35:50] yes
[1:35:52] she saw the
[1:35:55] sign she perceived the
[1:35:59] sign she saw the sign go get your
[1:36:03] husband I don't have a h you spoke the
[1:36:05] truth you've had five husbands and the
[1:36:09] one that you're with I wonder if he told
[1:36:12] her where she lived and what her name
[1:36:14] was and what the guy she's living with
[1:36:16] now was and told her what her mother was
[1:36:20] and told her what happened to her as a

[1:36:24] happened to
[1:36:29] her she accepted it she accepted the
[1:36:36] message not just the sign yes
[1:36:39] sir I'll say today too many people have
[1:36:43] accepted the sign of William Mary and
[1:36:45] brandom and have rejected the message
[1:36:48] that he brought and he didn't bring the
[1:36:50] re establishment of laws he didn't just
[1:36:53] bring dress codes he just didn't bring
[1:36:56] he brought
[1:36:57] life that's
[1:37:00] right he wanted to restore to us the
[1:37:05] same message that Jesus gave them that
[1:37:09] was our fathers what they accepted what
[1:37:12] they believed and what they rejoiced
[1:37:18] in what did she do
[1:37:22] she came from a street prostitute right
[1:37:25] on maybe she wasn't out there but from a
[1:37:28] destroyed marriage rejected uh having
[1:37:31] all kinds of
[1:37:33] trouble to having such a
[1:37:36] change such a
[1:37:39] Deliverance such a nature and Glory

[1:37:44] shining delivered free she said come see
[1:37:48] a
[1:37:50] man
[1:37:54] and
[1:37:55] many came
[1:37:57] out oh I would have liked to been at
[1:38:00] that prayer line Jesus they coming up to
[1:38:03] him you tell this is you're healed
[1:38:05] you're healed you're delivered you're
[1:38:09] healed that was his
[1:38:12] message we sing that song healing is
[1:38:14] here right salvation is here that's what
[1:38:18] he was telling them right
[1:38:23] all these benefits are here right
[1:38:25] forgiveness healing Deliverance no need
[1:38:29] to be sad
[1:38:31] life you don't have to be in Chains to
[1:38:34] your flesh and your
[1:38:37] mind you could just go down the woman
[1:38:39] that was caught in
[1:38:42] adultery I mean these are bad cases
[1:38:45] right but what was this
[1:38:49] message there's there's forgiveness for
[1:38:52] the worst case
[1:38:56] amen there's Deliverance the man
[1:38:59] possessed with
[1:39:01] Devils the man in the graveyard walking
[1:39:05] through the
[1:39:07] graveyard the the man with py the one
[1:39:11] who was crippled you could just go down
[1:39:14] it seems like every circumstance that
[1:39:17] was out
[1:39:19] there you understand the Nicodemus in
[1:39:22] the tree uh you can just go the the
[1:39:26] Pharisees daughter every every Walk of
[1:39:30] Life every circumstance every every
[1:39:35] imaginable circumstance he went and
[1:39:38] meant amen he went and stood in the face
[1:39:41] of that circumstance in the face of
[1:39:44] those conditions and his message was the
[1:39:47] God creator of Heaven and Earth is here
[1:39:51] to do for you exceedingly and abundantly
[1:39:55] above that which you can even ask or
[1:39:58] think that's
[1:40:00] right just think of the message right
[1:40:03] this great Christmas message this voice
[1:40:07] that came from those signs right what
[1:40:10] that he was bringing to the world
[1:40:14] right and yet our minds just keep
[1:40:17] rolling
[1:40:18] backwards into our yesterday
[1:40:24] I would love to wipe yesterday
[1:40:27] completely out of all of our
[1:40:34] memories and let you know you can
[1:40:37] startu this
[1:40:40] morning in Christ
[1:40:42] Jesus fresh and
[1:40:46] new
[1:40:48] Hallelujah that was the message that's
[1:40:53] right you'll never go make things right
[1:40:57] to
[1:40:58] justify what you did
[1:41:03] wrong did you hear
[1:41:06] me when
[1:41:10] Nicodemus you know here he is up in a
[1:41:13] tree right a little guy so he was mad at
[1:41:18] the
[1:41:18] world so he charged everybody you know
[1:41:21] he made a lot of money he would lend
[1:41:23] money and people owed him and that was
[1:41:26] his power
[1:41:27] trip so he could have control so he
[1:41:30] could feel like he was
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] important you
[1:41:36] know and and Jesus talks to him come on
[1:41:40] down invites him to his house you know
[1:41:42] his old praying wife's over there
[1:41:44] praying and he he just got to check this
[1:41:47] out what's his wife talking about climbs
[1:41:49] up in a tree Jesus stop calls him
[1:41:52] down invites him and and all of a sudden
[1:41:57] Nicodemus he had a change of heart he
[1:42:00] wasn't trying to make things right he
[1:42:03] says I'm going to give a third of what I
[1:42:05] got I'm going to forgive everybody's
[1:42:07] debt man this guy was UN
[1:42:10] fire he was
[1:42:13] happy he wanted to share the news you

[1:42:24] want to tell you what happened to me I
[1:42:26] want to tell you what I experienced I
[1:42:28] was there I saw him Cal me down I heard
[1:42:32] what he said to me that he had come in
[1:42:34] the world to save them which is lost and
[1:42:37] and and to impart eternal life he gave
[1:42:40] me something he changed my insides I'm
[1:42:44] now a new creature I heard what he was
[1:42:47] saying the God that he was uh bringing
[1:42:50] the god that he was trying to bring me
[1:42:52] in contact with the great Jehovah that
[1:42:55] we've worshiped in fear now I feel his
[1:42:58] presence inside of me I've got life and
[1:43:01] life more
[1:43:04] abundant they were hearing his
[1:43:07] message that was his message all down
[1:43:10] through the scripture message after
[1:43:15] message trying to get the
[1:43:18] people in contact not with their
[1:43:21] imaginary
[1:43:24] Jehovah or their imaginary God or their
[1:43:28] imaginary religion or their theologies
[1:43:33] or their doctrines or they trying their
[1:43:36] explanation of Christian
[1:43:40] history you don't need to know my past
[1:43:44] all you need to do is meet my future
[1:43:48] you'll never know me by my past
[1:43:53] J You'll Never Know
[1:43:56] Me by my history the only way you'll
[1:44:00] know me is to meet me today that's
[1:44:04] right because I've
[1:44:07] changed I've learned some things I don't
[1:44:11] get upset as
[1:44:13] easily as I used
[1:44:19] to
[1:44:22] you got you you you it that's not this
[1:44:27] is not a history
[1:44:30] study you'll never know the message of
[1:44:35] today by studying the history of
[1:44:39] yesterday the only thing you will learn
[1:44:41] from history is that God does everything
[1:44:45] the same
[1:44:46] way that if he did it one way he'll do
[1:44:50] it again
[1:44:51] if he sent signs before he'll send Signs
[1:44:58] Now it's like
[1:45:02] emotion the presence of God brings
[1:45:07] emotion something that doesn't have
[1:45:09] emotions is
[1:45:13] dead it's dead right if it if the
[1:45:17] presence of God doesn't stir up emotion
[1:45:20] in you then bury
[1:45:26] it when when you feel the presence of
[1:45:29] the Lord it causes you
[1:45:31] emotion the secret though is to
[1:45:34] understand that the emotions come from
[1:45:36] the present the presence of the Lord so
[1:45:40] you don't put your emphasis on the
[1:45:42] emotion you put your emphasis on the
[1:45:45] presence amen he's here amen he's here
[1:45:52] that's he can do for you this morning
[1:45:55] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:45:57] you can think or ass you're not doomed
[1:46:00] time doesn't Doom
[1:46:04] you there was a blind
[1:46:07] boy that was blind from his
[1:46:11] youth I would say that I don't know how
[1:46:14] old he
[1:46:15] was he he was a pretty smart fellow
[1:46:19] though
[1:46:21] I my guess is probably he was in his 40s
[1:46:25] that's my guess I don't recall the
[1:46:28] prophet of God gave him an
[1:46:30] age or not but he was old enough to to
[1:46:35] uh answer for
[1:46:38] himself in fact when they came to his
[1:46:41] parents his parents said
[1:46:44] well he's old enough to answer for
[1:46:49] himself h long he had he been
[1:46:52] blind since
[1:46:56] birth since birth he didn't
[1:46:59] see can I say that that that guy's
[1:47:02] natural blindness yes was just a type of
[1:47:07] spiritual blindness that's
[1:47:09] right people are blind in the church
[1:47:12] World it could be for years and years
[1:47:14] and years but it doesn't mean the minute
[1:47:17] the eyes have of God's word which is the
[1:47:20] promise of the ladyc in church age is
[1:47:23] that you might have eyes sa that you
[1:47:25] might see that if someone applies the
[1:47:28] eyes have to that spiritually Blind Eye
[1:47:31] that all of a sudden their eyes won't
[1:47:33] come open and they'll
[1:47:38] see so here he

[1:48:59] God is with

[1:50:48] places in the Bible to to understand all
[1:50:51] the circumstances all the Miracles all
[1:50:54] the people every place he reached out
[1:50:57] was just the great voice saying that
[1:50:59] this message is for all
[1:51:02] people behold today is born a
[1:51:07] savior for all

[1:51:51] none of those people could change
[1:51:53] themselves
[1:51:55] right they had to accept what he was
[1:51:59] offering they had to accept the voice
[1:52:03] and the message how many people in that
[1:52:06] day saw all those signs and never
[1:52:10] understood what was being
[1:52:15] offered a little part of the world then
[1:52:18] he sent them to an upper room
[1:52:20] and endured them with power from un
[1:52:23] High then now the what they saw in
[1:52:29] Jesus that
[1:52:31] spirit that was in Christ Jesus came
[1:52:34] back on him and it ain't blasphemy

[1:53:43] word when he says you're forgiven you
[1:53:47] are forgiven how many know the one thing
[1:53:51] that God can't
[1:53:52] do the Bible says
[1:54:00] lie when he says your sins with are many
[1:54:03] are forgiven yes sir he didn't leave out
[1:54:07] one that's right and he knew them
[1:54:12] all and he already knows what you have
[1:54:15] need of even before you
[1:54:18] ask
[1:54:20] that's what a message that's right what
[1:54:25] a voice and the world missed
[1:54:28] it right they missed
[1:54:31] it they missed the
[1:54:34] fellowship that God was offering them to
[1:54:36] become in all the benefits he put on
[1:54:40] display all the power that he put on
[1:54:42] display all the making bread into wine
[1:54:46] and I mean uh multiplying the Loaves and

[1:54:55] Sick and cleansing lepers oh my
[1:55:00] hallelujah what a God we serve what a
[1:55:03] mighty God we
[1:55:06] serve and he's trying to tell them don't
[1:55:09] worship that God that you think's locked
[1:55:12] up he rent that veil of that Temple to
[1:55:15] show them that God was now in the people
[1:55:19] God above us God With Us now God in
[1:55:25] us what a
[1:55:30] message that's where those disciples
[1:55:33] that's what he wanted the church to have
[1:55:34] that was the faith of our early fathers
[1:55:37] they
[1:55:38] accepted the
[1:55:40] message of the
[1:55:42] voice of the sign they were living in
[1:55:46] the days of the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:55:49] and they accepted
[1:55:52] it man these are not drunk as you
[1:55:55] suppose but this was was written of the
[1:55:59] Prophet doah I'll pour out my
[1:56:02] spirit they were living in the
[1:56:06] Fulfillment of the voice of the
[1:56:11] sign it's not religious
[1:56:14] substitute it's exing the message and
[1:56:18] the poor Gentile Church got so far away
[1:56:21] from that
[1:56:22] message that God's going to give them a
[1:56:25] sign too and he gave them the sign of
[1:56:28] Malachi
[1:56:30] 4:5 Luke
[1:56:32] 17:30 and Revelations 10:7
[1:56:36] amen he came
[1:56:40] again in our
[1:56:42] day with a
[1:56:48] sign I imagine imagine how his ministry
[1:56:51] started a little
[1:56:53] girl named Georgie
[1:56:57] Carter he goes prays for her she gets up
[1:57:00] he goes to a tent
[1:57:02] meeting on the road back from wherever
[1:57:05] he was coming back from I forget where
[1:57:08] and he stops in at a meeting and he
[1:57:12] says and they there was no flowers
[1:57:15] hallelu and they cried amen and there
[1:57:18] was no this and they cried and pretty
[1:57:21] soon the whole place was trying and he
[1:57:24] was
[1:57:26] crying and he was a
[1:57:29] Baptist he they said well we heard that
[1:57:33] there was a Baptist preacher here come
[1:57:37] on up and slid down this seat and
[1:57:39] someone said here he
[1:57:42] is and he got up and then this guy in
[1:57:44] Boots come and this other guy come and
[1:57:47] he begin to be invited and he began to
[1:57:50] tell the story how the angel came to him
[1:57:53] and how he'd know he'd take him by the
[1:57:57] hand now it's something if I said no I
[1:57:59] I'll take you by the
[1:58:01] hand we need to be like Shepherds right
[1:58:05] we need to go see if it was there how
[1:58:07] many people stood in line to come up so
[1:58:10] he could take them by the hand how many
[1:58:13] people did he take by the hand and he
[1:58:15] would see those bumps and those things
[1:58:18] move in his man and he would tell them
[1:58:21] what was wrong with them and he would
[1:58:23] deliver him and they experienced it you
[1:58:25] think the fame and of our Prophet
[1:58:28] messenger in this day went abroad based
[1:58:31] on
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:58:37] nothing if I and he didn't even want the
[1:58:41] fame he wanted people to know that the
[1:58:44] same message that Jesus Christ preached
[1:58:47] the same Deliverance the same healing
[1:58:49] the the same power the same Deliverance
[1:58:52] over no matter how long no matter what
[1:58:54] no matter when that our God is the god
[1:58:58] of Heaven and Earth he's the creator of
[1:59:02] all things and by his stripes we are
[1:59:04] healed and the chastisement of our peace
[1:59:07] is upon him that was the message he
[1:59:10] wasn't trying to bring a new message he
[1:59:13] was bringing the message of the Lord
[1:59:15] Jesus Christ back to the gentile people
[1:59:18] that every in have a change of nature
[1:59:22] have a change of
[1:59:24] heart have freedom in
[1:59:27] Deliverance wasn't a new message it was
[1:59:31] the same message Paul bought to the
[1:59:33] Gentiles it was the same message Peter
[1:59:36] brought it's only one message that's the
[1:59:40] word of God man tried to cover it up
[1:59:44] they've tried to use it for their own
[1:59:45] Advantage but God living in the day of
[1:59:49] the the Fulfillment of Prophecy has the
[1:59:51] same voice following the
[1:59:55] sign behold th send you Elijah the
[1:59:58] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[2:00:01] day of the
[2:00:05] Lord it didn't matter many people
[2:00:08] probably stood up many people today I've
[2:00:10] had them come through here by the dozens
[2:00:13] telling me that they're the two prophets
[2:00:15] to
[2:00:16] Israel of course you don't want to know
[2:00:18] my response
[2:00:20] wants I said what are you doing here
[2:00:23] then if you're the prophet to Israel you
[2:00:26] don't need me I'm a gentile I've already
[2:00:29] gotten my Prophet Malachi 4:5 take take
[2:00:32] a
[2:00:36] trip I might have said it nicer than
[2:00:38] that I doubt it but
[2:00:41] I but but he just couldn't make that

[2:08:33] missing this
[2:08:36] message of
[2:08:37] peace right that we
[2:08:40] have you know and we're living in the
[2:08:44] day of the
[2:08:46] Fulfillment of pro prophecy that's
[2:08:49] right the things that the voice has told
[2:08:54] us we're living in the day that it's
[2:08:57] coming to pass and I've come to the
[2:09:01] place that I'm tired of
[2:09:04] letting the perversion of this world I
[2:09:08] was
[2:09:09] told in Luke
[2:09:12] 17:30 as it was in the
[2:09:15] days of Sodom and gomorah shall so shall
[2:09:19] it be in the coming of the son of man
[2:09:24] when the son of man is
[2:09:26] revealed when the same
[2:09:29] spirit that was in Jesus Christ doing
[2:09:33] the same
[2:09:34] Works would come down and Veil himself
[2:09:38] in a prophet
[2:09:40] messenger in this
[2:09:43] generation and do the same signs and
[2:09:46] wonders that Jesus did
[2:09:49] so the people could receive the same
[2:09:52] message that Jesus
[2:09:57] gave Hallelujah joy unspeakable and full
[2:10:01] of Glory peace that's her path's
[2:10:05] understanding turn the other cheek go
[2:10:08] the extra mile if they C curse you they
[2:10:12] curse them before you rejoice when
[2:10:15] you're persecuted by all men
[2:10:19] for behold am your Redemption draweth
[2:10:23] nigh look
[2:10:25] up for your salvation draws nigh and I
[2:10:29] thought I've let the corruption of this
[2:10:32] world the political corruption I've been
[2:10:37] told it's corrupt I've looked everything
[2:10:40] about it and and I know I believe in the
[2:10:44] sign I've seen the Miracles I know it
[2:10:47] and how much time time that we can look
[2:10:49] at the sign and fail to get the voice
[2:10:52] and the message that the sign is giv we
[2:10:57] are living in the day of the Fulfillment
[2:11:01] of so many prophecies that are
[2:11:04] spoken but what was the sign given for
[2:11:08] that we could receive the message and
[2:11:11] what was the message we're living in the
[2:11:16] last days the coming of the Lord is at
[2:11:23] hand look
[2:11:26] up your Redemption draweth
[2:11:31] nigh what a thing we can do
