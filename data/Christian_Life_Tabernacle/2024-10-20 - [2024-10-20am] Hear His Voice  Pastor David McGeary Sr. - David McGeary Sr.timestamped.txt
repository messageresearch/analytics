[1:06:12] hallelujah our gracious
[1:06:16] father the ages have sung of your
[1:06:23] greatness even the scripture says
[1:06:26] that all the books of all the world and
[1:06:29] the pages can't contain the whole of all
[1:06:33] the things that you've done how that
[1:06:36] you've loved us
[1:06:40] father and how we've turned our back on
[1:06:44] you how you've kept
[1:06:48] us and yet we pursue our
[1:06:51] own faith
[1:06:55] Lord may you bring us closer to the
[1:06:58] reality of your love for us this
[1:07:03] morning because it hasn't even entered
[1:07:06] into the hearts or the minds of men the
[1:07:09] things that God has prepared for them
[1:07:12] that love him bless us this morning and
[1:07:15] help us we pray in Jesus precious and
[1:07:19] wonderful name amen amen God bless you
[1:07:23] you may be seated uh
[1:07:26] I I'd like just to uh kind of clarify so
[1:07:30] there's no uh
[1:07:33] misunderstanding
[1:07:35] uh the the Alexanders have chosen not to
[1:07:40] really have a funeral service like we
[1:07:43] normally would consider a funeral
[1:07:46] service so all that they're doing is
[1:07:50] just the
[1:07:51] visitation so the visitation is the
[1:07:54] funeral
[1:07:56] O Okay so there's not a visitation then
[1:07:59] a funeral to follow that alls are going
[1:08:02] to do is from 2 to 4 they're going to
[1:08:07] have a
[1:08:08] visitation and well we don't have too
[1:08:11] many deaths in our church because we're
[1:08:14] relatively a young
[1:08:17] congregation and God's been good to us
[1:08:19] and we certainly appreciate that but uh
[1:08:23] like you know our sister was
[1:08:26] uh uh baptized at 85 years old amen and
[1:08:31] uh all she would keep telling me all the
[1:08:34] time is I I I wish I'd have known this
[1:08:37] earlier I wish I'd have known this
[1:08:38] earlier you know and she would say my
[1:08:41] husband was trying to tell me you know
[1:08:43] but I but one day God opened her
[1:08:47] eyes amen and and it became life to her
[1:08:51] and she um she you know
[1:08:57] 86 years old I believe you know you your
[1:09:00] body just don't hold up
[1:09:02] forever and uh so she wanted to go
[1:09:06] home and I think the reason that she
[1:09:10] wanted to go home is she was solely 100%
[1:09:15] convinced there was a home to go to
[1:09:19] amen she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:09:23] that there was a world on the other side
[1:09:26] of this world I didn't my musicians ran
[1:09:30] off but uh I need a piano player so if I
[1:09:34] can at least get a piano player that
[1:09:36] good piano player
[1:09:40] reverse uh and so she knew that and so
[1:09:44] we're we're content with that we have a
[1:09:46] baby dedication maybe I should have said
[1:09:49] that first and uh uh so we'll do we'll
[1:09:53] have that but so anyway if you can go by
[1:09:56] there and give brother Miriam uh uh your
[1:10:00] condolences and you'll find that he's in
[1:10:02] good spirits uh they were married 65

[1:15:35] you would have a pull in you that
[1:15:38] something inside you reaches out for the

[1:15:44] we're going to read a few scriptures
[1:15:46] this morning
[1:15:47] and and uh hope that we can tie this
[1:15:52] thought together in a a manner that uh
[1:15:56] will bless us and I want to also play
[1:16:00] this morning we're going to play 30
[1:16:02] minutes of a sermon called hear his
[1:16:06] voice but I'd like to turn to Matthew
[1:16:08] the 13th
[1:16:10] chapter in The Book of Matthew and the
[1:16:14] 14th
[1:16:17] verse and then we'll turn to Hebrews the
[1:16:20] 5th chapter and the 11th verse
[1:16:30] now the disciples were
[1:16:32] questioning uh Jesus why that he spoke
[1:16:36] to him in Parables and and uh uh
[1:16:42] Jesus answered and and said these
[1:16:46] words he says and the disciples came and
[1:16:49] said unto him why speakest thou un to
[1:16:52] them in Parables and he answered and
[1:16:55] said unto them because it is given unto
[1:16:59] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:17:02] of heaven but to them it is not
[1:17:07] given what a privilege
[1:17:11] amen for whosoever hath to him shall be
[1:17:17] given and he shall have more abundantly
[1:17:21] but whosoever haveth not from him it
[1:17:24] shall be taken away even that he hath
[1:17:29] therefore I speak unto them in Parables
[1:17:33] because they seeing see not and hear
[1:17:38] they hear not neither do they
[1:17:42] understand for in them is fulfilled the
[1:17:45] prophecy of Isaias which
[1:17:48] saith by hearing ye shall hear and ye
[1:17:53] shall not understand
[1:17:55] and seen ye shall see and shall not
[1:18:00] preceive this is the people's heart is
[1:18:04] for this people's heart is wax gross and
[1:18:09] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[1:18:13] eyes they have closed list at any time
[1:18:18] they should see with their eyes and hear
[1:18:22] with their ears and should understand
[1:18:24] stand with their hearts and she should
[1:18:28] be converted and I should heal them amen
[1:18:33] and let's also turn over to
[1:18:37] Hebrews this morning and the
[1:18:42] U the uh fifth chapter of of of
[1:18:47] Hebrews and
[1:18:51] um read in the 11th verse
[1:19:00] it says of whom we have many things to
[1:19:04] say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are
[1:19:09] dull of hearing Heavenly Father we ask
[1:19:13] you to bless your word to us in Jesus
[1:19:16] precious name we pray amen God bless you
[1:19:19] you may be seated
[1:19:29] you know a great uh a great warning I
[1:19:34] guess I could say in the uh in the
[1:19:38] scripture uh here this morning is
[1:19:42] that um the
[1:19:45] people come to a place that they became
[1:19:49] become dull of
[1:19:51] hearing and you know the word dull
[1:19:55] uh if you would give it something that's
[1:20:01] practical uh to to get an understanding
[1:20:04] of
[1:20:05] it you if you have a dull knife or or a
[1:20:10] a dull blade that blade becomes
[1:20:14] ineffectual it it no longer it no longer
[1:20:19] uh does what it's intended to do so now
[1:20:24] you have something that's not working uh
[1:20:27] I don't know if you've ever uh some of
[1:20:30] the brothers are electricians you know
[1:20:32] sometimes we have a screwdriver that we
[1:20:35] hammer on to you know break lock nuts
[1:20:39] off or punch out holes and boxes and
[1:20:43] little Knockouts and all that and that
[1:20:45] screwdriver becames ve comes very dull
[1:20:49] and the end of it gets fat and and uh it
[1:20:53] becomes uneffectual and when somebody
[1:20:57] would you know i' say hand me a
[1:20:59] screwdriver and a guy would hand me his
[1:21:01] old beater you know and it wouldn't even
[1:21:03] fit in the slot you know what I mean and
[1:21:07] and that screwdriver is no
[1:21:10] good you know what I mean and so this
[1:21:14] this is a uh a a a warning because you
[1:21:19] have to understand all scriptures
[1:21:22] fulfill that's so to this
[1:21:25] morning this is a uh an admonishment you
[1:21:31] know what I mean a a word that allows us
[1:21:34] to hear it and then check ourselves up
[1:21:38] and make sure we're lining up because we
[1:21:41] don't want to become dull of hearing in
[1:21:44] other words we don't want to get to the
[1:21:46] place where the words that we are
[1:21:49] hearing have no effect on us they're not
[1:21:53] they're not speaking to us they're not
[1:21:55] changing our lives they're they're not
[1:21:59] shaking us from the inside they're
[1:22:01] they're not moving Us in any direction
[1:22:04] that we we we just we hear
[1:22:07] it but and we know it but it it just it
[1:22:13] it just becomes uh to a place that we
[1:22:17] don't understand what what what's the
[1:22:19] motive of behind me hearing this what
[1:22:23] what what what's the message that's in
[1:22:25] it I I come to church and that's another
[1:22:28] sermon and and all the brothers were
[1:22:30] just preaching preaching and I've heard
[1:22:32] this I know this and and everything and
[1:22:36] I'm fulfilling my duty and and and yes I
[1:22:39] can aim in that and and I think this is
[1:22:42] the the spirit that the Lord was warning
[1:22:46] his church against he said they've
[1:22:49] become dull of hearing and the prophets
[1:22:52] prophesied that this people they would
[1:22:54] hear all these things and they would
[1:22:56] hear it over and over again but it
[1:22:58] wasn't healing
[1:23:01] them do you understand it wasn't healing
[1:23:04] now it they would hear it but yet it
[1:23:07] wouldn't deliver them from their bondage
[1:23:09] it wouldn't deliver them from their
[1:23:11] sickness it wouldn't deliver them from
[1:23:13] the thing so it it became in
[1:23:17] ineffectual so when he said that you be
[1:23:21] dull of hearing and and this morning
[1:23:25] uh we we want to just approach this a
[1:23:28] little bit this morning that by the
[1:23:31] grace of God we can examine ourselves
[1:23:36] and make sure that we haven't become
[1:23:40] dull of hearing
[1:23:44] amen and it's and he he warns us it's
[1:23:47] not just
[1:23:49] hearing it's not just putting on a tape
[1:23:52] and playing a tape and say I've heard
[1:23:55] the tape I've listened to the prophet
[1:23:59] I've I I I've heard what he said and and
[1:24:03] you can actually be sitting there
[1:24:05] listening to the word and and just
[1:24:07] become numb to it so there there's not a
[1:24:11] message into it so now you're in a place
[1:24:14] of
[1:24:15] agreement and you can be in the place of
[1:24:18] agreement and be dull of hearing yes
[1:24:22] that's true yes that's true yes that's
[1:24:24] true I believe that that's exactly what
[1:24:27] I believe amen everything he says is
[1:24:30] right we should only say what he says
[1:24:32] I've got that down perfect yes
[1:24:35] sir I'm a Believer and there's
[1:24:38] absolutely no
[1:24:41] movement or change in your life and so I
[1:24:45] wanted to play the importance of to
[1:24:49] emphasize the importance to you this
[1:24:52] morning of hearing the word of God I
[1:24:57] wanted to just play a portion out of the
[1:25:00] message hear his
[1:25:03] voice and then we want to go from there
[1:25:07] and make a few comments and I'll try to
[1:25:09] make my comments brief uh if the Lord
[1:25:13] would give me Grace to to do that so I
[1:25:18] just pay attention this morning and
[1:25:22] listen to what how many believe when the
[1:25:24] prophet preaches it's the spirit of God
[1:25:27] speaking to you absolutely amen I
[1:25:30] believe it's a message yes sir and I
[1:25:33] believe it's stored up amen and and by
[1:25:36] the wisdom of God he knew there would be
[1:25:39] a people his children that were going to
[1:25:42] go through a dark and
[1:25:45] dry
[1:25:47] time and that it would be perilous days
[1:25:52] and there would be a famine in the land
[1:25:55] for the word of
[1:25:58] God there's certainly not a famine for
[1:26:02] music there's certainly not a famine for
[1:26:05] entertainment but for the pure word of
[1:26:07] God and and just as a type in Egypt when
[1:26:12] they were going to have those years of
[1:26:14] famine we've come to the time in the
[1:26:16] church age where that that famine is
[1:26:19] here and the wisdom of God went and
[1:26:23] stored up food F in the
[1:26:25] storehouse so that you could go into
[1:26:28] that Storehouse and that you could
[1:26:31] receive food but we don't want that food
[1:26:34] to become dull to us or in ineffectual
[1:26:39] to us we need to recognize the
[1:26:41] importance of it and it's not something
[1:26:45] that's gone
[1:26:46] by and I like this statement he says he
[1:26:50] says but ministers are always trying to
[1:26:53] refer back to what somebody else said
[1:26:58] way back behind them instead of what God
[1:27:04] Said
[1:27:07] do that's some
[1:27:10] tremendous thought right there he says
[1:27:13] we are climbing the tree of faith and
[1:27:18] that's what we're doing we're climbing
[1:27:19] the tree of faith and and you know and I
[1:27:22] I got to think and sometimes s uh we
[1:27:25] become critical maybe because people are
[1:27:28] at a different place in their clim but
[1:27:32] we want to get to the place where we
[1:27:35] hear his voice amen that that's what our
[1:27:40] final destination is of this morning is
[1:27:45] that each of us would examine
[1:27:48] ourselves no matter what age you
[1:27:52] are high school grade school it doesn't
[1:27:55] matter you're hearing the voice of your
[1:27:58] teacher you're hearing the voices of all
[1:28:01] these musicians all these things surely
[1:28:04] you can hear the voice of God and that's
[1:28:07] what we want to catch in our lives is
[1:28:09] are we hearing the voice of God so that
[1:28:14] that's what we because we want to climb
[1:28:16] this tree of faith and we want to climb
[1:28:18] it to where that we have such a union
[1:28:21] with him that that we know that he's
[1:28:25] speaking to us so if you would uh just
[1:28:28] with me a moment because um we hope that
[1:28:33] that this there's so many little nuggets
[1:28:36] if if you will listen and and this is
[1:28:39] the probably if I could say this his
[1:28:42] complaint to the people or his
[1:28:45] instruction to the people we do all the
[1:28:49] talking but we don't take time to hear
[1:28:53] him so would you join with me for the
[1:28:56] next 30 minutes and then if you'll help
[1:28:58] me make some comments afterwards but
[1:29:01] we're doing this in our heart this
[1:29:03] morning because we want all of us to get
[1:29:06] ready for that rapture we want the Holy
[1:29:09] Spirit to be able to move in us and to
[1:29:12] hear the voice of God and have that Holy
[1:29:15] unction and know where we stand so if
[1:29:18] Lord richly bless you we're going to
[1:29:20] start uh let us go ahead and stand and
[1:29:23] and for the reading of the word of
[1:29:26] God and our prophet's going to read from
[1:29:29] 1 Samuel the 3
[1:29:31] chapter and he wants to read for uh the
[1:29:36] first 10 verses so 1 Samuel the third
[1:29:41] chapter and um and we'll read the the
[1:29:46] the scriptures here and uh uh uh and he
[1:29:52] he says I want to take
[1:29:54] for a text hear his voice so God richly
[1:29:59] bless you as we spend the next 30
[1:30:02] minutes listening to this word and then
[1:30:05] I trust God will help us bring it alive
[1:30:07] in our lives amen God bless
[1:30:12] you now I want to take part a
[1:30:16] text here his
[1:30:20] voice that will do for little girls and
[1:30:23] big girls and little boys and big boys
[1:30:28] all remember the text here his
[1:30:34] voice now of you that's turning in the
[1:30:37] scriptures to 1 Samuel the third
[1:30:41] chapter this is how it reads for the
[1:30:44] first uh 10
[1:30:47] verses and the child Samuel ministered
[1:30:52] unto the Lord before El
[1:30:55] and the word of the Lord was precious in
[1:30:58] those
[1:31:01] days there was no open
[1:31:06] Vision oh how I would like to dwell
[1:31:09] there for a
[1:31:10] minute maybe some other time It just
[1:31:13] strikes
[1:31:14] me let me just read it once again that
[1:31:18] verse and the child Samuel ministered in
[1:31:22] unto the Lord before
[1:31:25] Eli and the word of the Lord was
[1:31:29] precious in those
[1:31:32] days for there was no open
[1:31:37] Vision see what a vision is that it's a
[1:31:40] direct word of the
[1:31:44] Lord and the Lord's word was precious
[1:31:49] and it came to pass at that time when uh
[1:31:53] Eli was laid down in his place and his
[1:31:57] eyes be to wax dim that he could not
[1:32:02] see and here the lamp of God went out in
[1:32:06] the temple of the Lord where the Ark of
[1:32:10] God
[1:32:11] was and Samuel was laid down to
[1:32:15] sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he
[1:32:19] answered here am I
[1:32:26] and he ran to Eli and said here am I for
[1:32:31] thou callest me and he said I call not
[1:32:37] lie down
[1:32:39] again and he went and laid
[1:32:43] down and the
[1:32:45] Lord and the Lord called yet again
[1:32:50] Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli
[1:32:54] and said here I here am I for thou didst
[1:32:59] call me and he answered I call not my
[1:33:04] son lie down
[1:33:06] again now Samuel did not yet know the
[1:33:10] Lord neither was the word of the Lord
[1:33:14] yet revealed unto
[1:33:16] him and the Lord called Samuel again the
[1:33:20] third time and he arose and went to El
[1:33:23] El and said here am I for thou didst
[1:33:27] call me and Eli perceived that the Lord
[1:33:32] had called the
[1:33:34] child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go
[1:33:38] lie down and it shall be if he call thee
[1:33:43] that thou shalt say Speak
[1:33:47] Lord for thy servant yth so Samuel went
[1:33:52] and laid down
[1:33:54] in his place and the Lord came and stood
[1:33:59] and called as at other times
[1:34:05] Samuel
[1:34:07] Samuel and Samuel
[1:34:10] answered speak for thy servant
[1:34:20] here the voice of God
[1:34:25] hearing his voice in that day was a rare
[1:34:29] thing see there was no open
[1:34:34] vision
[1:34:36] and it was a rare thing the real voice
[1:34:41] of
[1:34:42] God because the people had gotten away
[1:34:45] they had a church in that day that just
[1:34:49] didn't follow the Commandments of the
[1:34:51] Lord
[1:34:53] they had a a minister by the name of
[1:34:57] Eli and he had got away from God but
[1:35:01] just teaching the precepts of what the
[1:35:04] people wanted to
[1:35:06] believe if that isn't parallel to this
[1:35:12] day he just taught the people and he he
[1:35:16] uh took his choice ones and he had his
[1:35:19] sons to take the best of the flesh from
[1:35:22] their the hook out of the the offering
[1:35:25] and it just become a place where the
[1:35:28] offering was the main
[1:35:30] thing and Samuel just caress about the
[1:35:34] way that he handled the Commandments of
[1:35:37] the
[1:35:39] Lord and the real word of God was a rare
[1:35:46] thing that's the way it is
[1:35:49] today we go to church and we find the
[1:35:53] people going in and having some great
[1:35:56] drive on we want to make our
[1:35:59] denomination this year so many more
[1:36:02] bring your letter from your other church
[1:36:04] and Unite with
[1:36:07] us and slogans like a million more and
[1:36:11] 44 and all such as that c trying to
[1:36:15] outgrow the next
[1:36:20] denomination and in doing so we've let
[1:36:23] the bars
[1:36:25] down of the Bible we've got away and
[1:36:29] begin to teach different
[1:36:33] things the prophets spoke of these
[1:36:36] days that when they F teaching would
[1:36:40] teach the man's Doctrine and not God's
[1:36:44] Doctrine and we've seen so much of that
[1:36:48] and it's gone on so long until today the
[1:36:53] word of the Lord is a rare
[1:36:57] thing that someone can come and say thus
[1:37:02] sayth the
[1:37:04] Lord now we've had a lot of
[1:37:07] impersonations of
[1:37:09] that Satan is really on the
[1:37:13] job and many years gone by people were
[1:37:17] afraid to say that unless it was the
[1:37:20] Lord but today they just don't care
[1:37:25] but it's a rare thing to hear the voice
[1:37:29] of the
[1:37:31] Lord and to find a person that can say
[1:37:36] the Lord spoke to
[1:37:39] me you notice that amongst the people
[1:37:43] anymore that they hardly hear a time
[1:37:46] that when they say the Lord spoke to me
[1:37:50] when men and women used to pray all
[1:37:52] night
[1:37:54] and their homes were set in order by the
[1:37:58] book of the
[1:37:59] Lord and God was first in their
[1:38:03] home see we got too many things ahead of
[1:38:06] the
[1:38:07] Lord you can't have the prayer meeting
[1:38:09] because Mr Godfrey's on
[1:38:12] tonight you can't have the prayer
[1:38:15] meeting before we love susi's on tonight
[1:38:19] or some kind of a foolish nonsense like
[1:38:23] that that takes up the
[1:38:25] time and we don't have time to hear the
[1:38:29] voice of the
[1:38:32] Lord and those who do claim to be
[1:38:37] Christians just kneel down with a little
[1:38:40] prayer like this kind of
[1:38:43] homemade Lord bless me and my family and
[1:38:46] take care of us good
[1:38:50] night and the next morning rise and say
[1:38:53] uh
[1:38:54] just got us through the day good
[1:38:58] day we should wait on the
[1:39:03] Lord you see we do all the
[1:39:06] Talking we don't give him a chance to
[1:39:09] talk back to
[1:39:12] us that if we would pray and pray until
[1:39:18] our soul comes into the presence of
[1:39:21] God and then just relax and listen to
[1:39:25] his
[1:39:27] voice but there's so many voices
[1:39:31] today that takes the voice of the Lord
[1:39:34] away from
[1:39:35] us there's a voice of
[1:39:39] pleasure so many people are listening to
[1:39:43] that where they can go and have a good
[1:39:47] time and many of them are professing to
[1:39:50] be
[1:39:51] Christians some kind of an old rock and
[1:39:54] roll coming up they just can't listen to
[1:39:57] what God they say well I'm a Christian I
[1:39:59] read a verse in the Bible today yeah uh
[1:40:01] Jesus wept that's it go
[1:40:06] ahead but then to really get down and
[1:40:11] pray they got too many other things to
[1:40:13] do there's so many voices in the
[1:40:17] world so many things to attract our
[1:40:21] attention from God
[1:40:24] and yesterday when the wife and I had
[1:40:27] run over to the supermarket to get some
[1:40:32] groceries and I was hurrying because I
[1:40:35] was late with appointments and things
[1:40:37] and rushing real quick
[1:40:40] and there was a little boy stand there
[1:40:43] half asleep and a little old girl come
[1:40:46] along there with some little trousers on
[1:40:49] that belong to some man
[1:40:54] they had to because they were made for
[1:40:59] man and the Bible says it's an
[1:41:01] abomination in the sight of God for a
[1:41:04] woman to wear
[1:41:06] it and with the lot of this sure lips
[1:41:10] stick on and her eyes about half asleep
[1:41:14] she said where is the so and so to that
[1:41:17] little boy he said how you expect me to
[1:41:21] know she said you remember I never got
[1:41:25] in until 6:00 this morning and she
[1:41:28] wasn't over 12 years
[1:41:33] old now Jesus at 12 which was our
[1:41:36] example said don't you know I should be
[1:41:39] about my father's
[1:41:42] business no wonder the voice of God is a
[1:41:46] rare thing today it's smothered out by
[1:41:50] so many different voices
[1:41:54] so many things that dim and take
[1:42:00] away it's got to a place until it dulls
[1:42:04] our
[1:42:06] senses until we can't hear the voice of
[1:42:10] God our senses of where we are to shake
[1:42:14] oursel and realize that you are man and
[1:42:18] women and you are the creation of God
[1:42:24] and you were put here to serve
[1:42:29] him but Satan's voice and false
[1:42:33] prophets oh be
[1:42:37] modern as I was speaking a few days ago
[1:42:40] I was coming to church and I turned my
[1:42:43] radio on and I heard a program out of
[1:42:45] Louisville it said that they were
[1:42:47] teaching their children in
[1:42:49] churches to just drink moderately
[1:42:55] makinging them modern so that they won't
[1:42:58] go to the
[1:43:00] excess oh they need to teach them Christ
[1:43:07] not
[1:43:10] drinking and that will wreck and ruin
[1:43:13] and damn any
[1:43:17] home how could the voice of God speak
[1:43:21] among a family that's have Saddles with
[1:43:24] whiskey and their minds paralyzed with
[1:43:27] smoking and drinking and all night long
[1:43:33] cring man that Waits upon God comes into
[1:43:37] his
[1:43:38] presence and to come into the presence
[1:43:41] of God is just like going out early
[1:43:43] every morning when the Dew and the
[1:43:46] honeysuckles are all
[1:43:49] sweet when you come in the presence of a
[1:43:53] person like that you know they have been
[1:43:55] with
[1:43:56] God my wife said to me coming down this
[1:44:01] morning she said Billy I don't mean to
[1:44:04] say this to flow anybody but she said
[1:44:08] last night I believe her one of the
[1:44:10] night she said I set by one of the
[1:44:11] little Amish
[1:44:14] women and a little lady with a little
[1:44:16] cap on her hand she said and you could
[1:44:20] tell that woman had been with Jesus
[1:44:24] she was sweet her soul was mellow her
[1:44:28] eyes were
[1:44:30] clear there's nothing those sin or
[1:44:32] nothing to hide behind or anything she'd
[1:44:35] been in the presence of
[1:44:38] God her senses wasn't dull by whiskey
[1:44:42] and tobacco and all kinds of things of
[1:44:45] the world she was refreshed from the
[1:44:48] presence of God reading her Bible
[1:44:51] Hallelujah studying God's
[1:44:55] word but we modern
[1:44:58] Americans what we
[1:45:01] do and the false prophets behind the
[1:45:04] pull pit say that's all
[1:45:07] right I'm kind of in the notion of
[1:45:10] saying this if I'm wrong God forgive me
[1:45:15] and I'm persuaded that a lot of them
[1:45:17] don't know
[1:45:20] God the congregation will never live any
[1:45:23] higher than this
[1:45:25] pastor no wonder the scripture says
[1:45:28] these Shepherds how they have scattered
[1:45:31] the
[1:45:32] flock War unto
[1:45:34] them they are the branches that bears
[1:45:37] not fruit which will be plucked off and
[1:45:42] burned so many things to dull the senses
[1:45:46] of the people
[1:45:49] today oh but in the
[1:45:53] midst of all
[1:45:56] that in spite of every dulling and every
[1:46:02] voice that's in the world today some of
[1:46:05] them pleasure
[1:46:07] voices some of them are are sinful
[1:46:11] voices to lure the people but in the
[1:46:15] spite of every bit of that the truth of
[1:46:19] God Still Remains he that will hear my
[1:46:23] voice and come after
[1:46:27] me men and women who will hear the voice
[1:46:29] of God God still waits to speak to every
[1:46:33] individual that'll open their ears to
[1:46:36] hear God's
[1:46:39] voice if a man who isn't
[1:46:42] Pastor many times people say couldn't
[1:46:45] you do this couldn't you run over here
[1:46:47] couldn't you do this oh I love to do
[1:46:50] it but I've got to stay in the presence
[1:46:54] of God if I'm going to do the thing
[1:46:56] right amen and people say oh brother
[1:47:00] brandom's one of these isolationist
[1:47:02] that's not
[1:47:03] it I love people but there's just
[1:47:06] thousands of them but I must stay with
[1:47:10] him to find out what he'd have me tell

[1:47:21] busy but what you can stay in the
[1:47:23] presence and listen for his
[1:47:26] voice God always keeps his word and no
[1:47:30] matter how bad the times may be how much
[1:47:33] your church May teach against it Jesus
[1:47:37] Christ is still willing to speak that
[1:47:39] still Small Voice to anybody that'll
[1:47:42] listen for
[1:47:44] him he's still ready to do it if we're
[1:47:49] just quiet ourselves but we run in

[1:48:11] got a better order than
[1:48:13] that it's
[1:48:17] true the Masonic lodge and all other
[1:48:20] lodges are all right but it's still is
[1:48:22] it the house of God there's where God
[1:48:26] speaks those loges try to make you
[1:48:29] marrow but God makes you righteous to
[1:48:33] Jesus Christ his
[1:48:37] son

[1:48:45] you but listen to his still Small Voice
[1:48:49] every one of you people who profess to
[1:48:51] be Christians get yourself white before

[1:48:59] hinder don't let nobody know what you're
[1:49:01] doing just go before
[1:49:05] him get up in the woods

[1:49:14] door when the kids gets at school there
[1:49:18] get down on your knees you've heard all
[1:49:20] kinds of voices everywhere but gu get
[1:49:23] down and stay there until those voices
[1:49:26] are
[1:49:28] silenced and you begin to lift
[1:49:30] up it'll change you it'll make you
[1:49:36] different like it did this little
[1:49:40] Samuel it'll do something to you if
[1:49:43] you'll just do it
[1:49:46] now it'll make you what you should be
[1:49:49] it'll make you the kind of Christian
[1:49:50] that you ought to be
[1:49:53] now let's us go back off of this modern
[1:49:56] day until a day that's passed let's go
[1:50:01] back to the days of the Early
[1:50:04] times and this voice of God has come to
[1:50:08] man in all walks of life in all
[1:50:12] ages no matter if you're a farmer if you
[1:50:15] are a shoe cobbler whatever you may
[1:50:19] be God still speaks if you're a sinner
[1:50:24] if you're a prostitute Harlot if you are
[1:50:27] drunker if you are what a local church
[1:50:30] member nomin nominal whatever you might
[1:50:35] be the voice of God still waits to speak
[1:50:38] to
[1:50:41] you I'm thinking now of
[1:50:45] Moses when is already 80 years
[1:50:49] old and had 80 years of theological iCal
[1:50:55] training and he knew the scriptures he
[1:50:58] knew them
[1:51:01] well and he had a promise to him that he
[1:51:06] was going to be the deliver of his
[1:51:08] people but yet just knowing the
[1:51:11] scriptures and being a a formal church
[1:51:13] member of that modern Church in that day
[1:51:16] he tuck the thing over in his own hands
[1:51:19] and tried to do it he slew an Egyptian
[1:51:24] you see what you do without listening to
[1:51:27] God you just mess it
[1:51:31] up and when the devil this morning would
[1:51:34] say don't you be
[1:51:37] baptized another would say oh do it
[1:51:40] later one would say you better be sure
[1:51:43] you know what you're doing and other
[1:51:46] would say you're going to lose a good
[1:51:48] time the only way to settle that is go
[1:51:51] to God 's word with
[1:51:57] it but people today don't seem to want
[1:52:00] to do
[1:52:00] that and Moses he had been to the best
[1:52:04] of the rabbis but they got formal and
[1:52:08] cold he had heard the story his mother
[1:52:11] told him how that he was hid in the bull
[1:52:13] rushes and how that the big alligators
[1:52:16] couldn't get a hold of him how they
[1:52:18] floting down that stream as that little
[1:52:20] baby wor the the old alligator was just
[1:52:23] fat it's for the little
[1:52:25] children they were fat from eating them
[1:52:28] little babies they had old hook nose
[1:52:30] women police women never did have a baby
[1:52:33] didn't know how the love of a baby was
[1:52:36] or they just go out there and take and
[1:52:38] kill them little babies and throw them
[1:52:39] out in the river the more alligators
[1:52:41] will just fat on them little
[1:52:43] babies and yet
[1:52:46] God put up the mother's heart to place
[1:52:51] her baby right in death don't you see it
[1:52:55] was a type of
[1:52:56] Christ he went right into death and
[1:53:00] every one of more alligators that come
[1:53:01] up that little bitty basket going down
[1:53:04] the river you know why they couldn't do
[1:53:05] it why they couldn't eat that little
[1:53:06] baby there was an angel sitting
[1:53:10] there get away from
[1:53:17] here why God gives his angels charge to
[1:53:22] watch over over his people don't you get
[1:53:24] scared honey God's watching
[1:53:28] you the devil may try to do something to
[1:53:30] you but God's
[1:53:32] greater so alligators have to run away
[1:53:34] from that little
[1:53:36] basket and yet Moses knew all these
[1:53:42] things and yet after 40 years of
[1:53:45] training and then in the wilderness he
[1:53:48] still tried to take the thing over in
[1:53:50] his hands we know the Bible What God
[1:53:53] Says to do and yet we say well now we'll
[1:53:56] make this be this way it's just the days
[1:53:59] of Miracles are not so anymore we know
[1:54:01] we don't believe we see them anymore and
[1:54:04] we believe the days of Miracles just
[1:54:06] passed and the sprinkling is just as
[1:54:08] good as immersing and father son and
[1:54:10] holy spirit's just as good as the name
[1:54:12] of the Lord Jesus and so we'll just the
[1:54:14] rest of them is going that way so we'll
[1:54:15] just do that
[1:54:17] too Moses had been a military man
[1:54:23] and he thought that the way that he was
[1:54:25] trained as being a military man that he
[1:54:28] could just kill them Egyptians off with
[1:54:30] his hand to be just as good as doing
[1:54:31] what god did did you ever think of it
[1:54:34] everybody condemns Moses for killing one
[1:54:37] man and he come back down under the
[1:54:39] anointing of the Holy Ghost and kill the
[1:54:40] whole thing nobody said nothing about
[1:54:43] it he slew all of Pharaoh's
[1:54:47] Army but God was in it God wasn't in the
[1:54:50] first one and then Moses just Chuck full
[1:54:54] of church
[1:54:56] theology us to be the next
[1:54:58] pharaoh and we find him still not
[1:55:03] knowing god but one morning on the
[1:55:06] backside of the desert an old man of 80
[1:55:10] years old his Whiskers hanging way down
[1:55:14] low he seen a burning bush and he turned
[1:55:18] aside to see what was going on and when
[1:55:21] he got near the bush he heard a
[1:55:27] voice God had to quien him for 40 years
[1:55:31] before he could ever speak to
[1:55:33] him and we won't stay quite 10 minutes
[1:55:36] so God can speak to us with all the
[1:55:39] rumble and Bumble we have of this day
[1:55:42] and
[1:55:44] yet Moses after 40 years stood there and
[1:55:48] in the presence of that bush and that
[1:55:51] one voice that called him he knew more
[1:55:54] about God in 5 minutes after that and
[1:55:57] all the 80 years of training had taught
[1:55:59] him it made a different man out of
[1:56:02] him it'll make a different man and woman
[1:56:05] out of you if you'll just stand still
[1:56:09] long enough to hear his
[1:56:11] voice like Samuel
[1:56:14] did stand still don't be excited if you
[1:56:19] want something of God asked him then
[1:56:21] stand still and listen see what he's
[1:56:22] going to say about it just open up your
[1:56:25] heart say what about it Lord Jesus just
[1:56:28] stay there if he doesn't answer the
[1:56:29] first five hours then wait another if he
[1:56:32] doesn't answer today then he'll answer
[1:56:34] tomorrow if he doesn't answer this week
[1:56:36] he will next
[1:56:37] week stay there till he
[1:56:40] answers hear his voice speak back in
[1:56:44] your heart and say yes I'm the Lord that
[1:56:46] Health thee that's all over you settl
[1:56:50] land I'm the Lord who forgives all thy
[1:56:53] sins now go and sin the more I don't
[1:56:56] condemn you then you can go free you're
[1:56:59] all right but you want to be sure that
[1:57:03] you hear that voice
[1:57:06] speak Moses heard it he was a changed
[1:57:10] man look at
[1:57:13] Isaiah the prophet as a young man he had
[1:57:17] it made the great favor came in them
[1:57:21] days a righteous man a good man he loved
[1:57:25] Isaiah for he knew he was a
[1:57:27] prophet and so he just leaned upon the
[1:57:30] king's arm everything he had wanted by
[1:57:34] is give it to him and every time he
[1:57:36] wanted anything mother the good king
[1:57:38] would give it to him but there come a
[1:57:41] time that the king
[1:57:46] died Prosperity always ruins people
[1:57:54] that's a hard thing to
[1:57:56] say but Prosperity takes a man away from
[1:58:01] God God spoke one place in the Bible
[1:58:03] something on this line and he said when
[1:58:06] I blessed you and gave you much when you
[1:58:09] were poor and you didn't have nothing I
[1:58:12] come to you and you hear me and you
[1:58:16] serve me but when I bless you and give
[1:58:18] you plenty then you turned your head
[1:58:20] from me that's what Amer America's
[1:58:23] done turn their heads that's what the
[1:58:26] church has done you can sit down on the
[1:58:29] corners and have the great fine
[1:58:31] buildings and the millions of dollars
[1:58:33] per placed into it and everything just
[1:58:35] as easy as it can be no wonder you
[1:58:38] haven't got time to hear God's
[1:58:40] voice but wait till the hour comes when
[1:58:43] that's took
[1:58:46] away then you'll long to hear
[1:58:49] it everything's fine now but the hours
[1:58:52] coming when it won't be that
[1:58:54] way so Isaiah he could lean upon the
[1:58:58] king's arm and he was a young man of
[1:59:00] favored fine spirit in this young man so
[1:59:03] the king loved him and one day the props
[1:59:07] was knocked out from under him the king
[1:59:09] died and when the king died then Isaiah
[1:59:13] had to go
[1:59:16] alone and then he be to look around and
[1:59:19] he found out that everybody wasn't like
[1:59:22] the
[1:59:24] king you be kicked out some of these
[1:59:26] days from these in denominational like
[1:59:28] this it'll come a time when you'll have
[1:59:30] to belong to an organization or you
[1:59:33] can't worship as you know the scripture
[1:59:36] says it will
[1:59:37] be they just make fun of you now but
[1:59:40] there'll be a time where there'll be a
[1:59:43] boycott for the mark of the beast must
[1:59:46] come you'll either belong to the
[1:59:48] confederation of the churches the Beast
[1:59:50] like it is in Rome or you won't worship
[1:59:53] at
[1:59:54] all that's what the scripture
[1:59:57] says that's when you'll have to cry like
[2:00:00] Isaiah
[2:00:01] did and he got out in the temple and he
[2:00:05] realized that he raised his hands and he
[2:00:07] said oh Lord I am a man of unclean
[2:00:13] lips you think you're good but wait till
[2:00:15] that time
[2:00:16] comes I dwell among peoples of unclean
[2:00:21] lips what did he got
[2:00:24] desperate and when you get desperate
[2:00:26] about this thing something will take
[2:00:29] place you're not desperate enough oh
[2:00:32] well I join church that settles it but
[2:00:35] you have to be desperate about it you
[2:00:38] have to really need God Jesus said
[2:00:41] blessed are they that do hunger and
[2:00:43] thirst after righteousness for they
[2:00:46] shall be
[2:00:48] filled but as long as you're satisfied
[2:00:50] with the things of the world how can God
[2:00:52] ever speak to you you say God never
[2:00:55] spoke to me why he wants
[2:00:59] to but you're too filled up with the
[2:01:01] things of the
[2:01:02] world that's what's the matter with us
[2:01:04] today we put all of our time on things
[2:01:07] of the world and the pleasures of the
[2:01:08] world and give no time to
[2:01:11] God it's true
[2:01:22] pretty
[2:01:24] straight
[2:01:26] amen and we we want we want to hold that
[2:01:30] now I couldn't I couldn't preach it any
[2:01:33] better if I spent hours and days and
[2:01:36] months trying to put it together but
[2:01:38] you've got the
[2:01:40] picture right we become
[2:01:45] dull okay dull of
[2:01:48] hearing and and and we're we're not
[2:01:51] saying this for condemnation this
[2:01:54] morning we're we're we're saying these
[2:01:57] things so that that we can take heed and
[2:02:02] and climb that tree of faith and and get
[2:02:07] to the the place uh the place where we
[2:02:12] we need to be amen and and and so you
[2:02:16] know from from that that standpoint uh I
[2:02:20] just want to make some
[2:02:22] comments to you because again what what
[2:02:27] we're here to do is we want to rise up
[2:02:31] in the arms of Faith how many know
[2:02:33] there's a faith that's coming to the
[2:02:35] church called a rapturing
[2:02:39] faith you understand and and so we we
[2:02:42] read the
[2:02:43] statement and uh it's he he said he says
[2:02:49] he says instead of what God said do
[2:02:54] they're always talking about things
[2:02:56] talking about miracles talking about
[2:02:58] what God did the blessings of God and
[2:03:00] we've got to have those things those are
[2:03:03] the things that let us know that God's
[2:03:05] in our midst but this is something that
[2:03:08] comes down to you
[2:03:10] personally where where and and I I came
[2:03:13] to this by oh conviction in my heart I
[2:03:20] just meditating on my bed and I begin to
[2:03:23] think of how many things that I do that
[2:03:27] I've I just never really consulted the
[2:03:30] Lord
[2:03:31] about and his grace and his Mercy is
[2:03:34] always good he's always making a way
[2:03:37] he's always makes things work out and
[2:03:40] and we know that things work out for the
[2:03:43] good to them that are called according
[2:03:46] to his purpose that's his Mercy to us we
[2:03:48] know that his permissive will always
[2:03:51] works to together towards the perfect
[2:03:54] will but I thought well if I how would I
[2:03:57] like to C climb up above the place where
[2:04:01] God's always looking after me and always
[2:04:03] taking care of me and always fixing all
[2:04:05] my messes and everything and that's what
[2:04:08] I heard him say he said if if if you
[2:04:10] don't go with God you just end up with a
[2:04:12] mess so it's not our election that's in
[2:04:16] question
[2:04:17] here you understand that that's not what
[2:04:20] we're talking about we're not talking
[2:04:23] about continually proving to you you are
[2:04:25] the children of God you are the elect of
[2:04:28] God you are the Bride of God you're all
[2:04:31] these things you're sealed into the book
[2:04:33] that's all fine that put that on the
[2:04:36] paper believe it with all your heart but
[2:04:38] this is coming to a place where you can
[2:04:40] say God's talking to
[2:04:46] me
[2:04:48] am heck
[2:04:50] and and and we've got to
[2:04:55] hear and he says we just listened to it
[2:04:58] so beautifully he wants to speak to you
[2:05:02] personally just think of how us we just
[2:05:05] we are in our routines we're in our
[2:05:08] daily lives we do what we do day in and
[2:05:10] day out day in and day out it's like
[2:05:13] we're waiting for something to
[2:05:17] happen but but there's something that
[2:05:19] should be burning in in us God Speak to
[2:05:25] Me Here I Am Lord speak to me what would
[2:05:29] it be that you would have me to
[2:05:33] do Lord let it be done unto me according
[2:05:36] to thy will and so we're we're talking
[2:05:39] about moving in not to just the place
[2:05:44] where that it's what God's doing that we
[2:05:48] re that we rejoice in and somebody gives
[2:05:51] a great testimony and we rejoice in that
[2:05:54] or someone talk to you about all the
[2:05:57] things that God can do and and that
[2:06:00] raises your faith up and and so you run
[2:06:02] up to the prayer line and you say I
[2:06:04] heard that God does this I heard that
[2:06:07] God does that I I want that to happen to
[2:06:11] me but we're talking about something
[2:06:14] greater than
[2:06:16] that more mature than
[2:06:19] that higher up the tree of Faith than
[2:06:23] that where individuals actually have God
[2:06:28] speaking to
[2:06:31] them and they can act on the voice that
[2:06:34] God talks to their heart they can act on
[2:06:37] it and see the
[2:06:42] results I'd like us to read some
[2:06:45] statements and this is from where I'm
[2:06:47] going to get some of my inspiration this
[2:06:50] morning from hearing recognizing and
[2:06:52] acting on the word of God we already
[2:06:56] heard the first thing you got to do is
[2:06:58] hear
[2:06:58] it and then you've got to recognize
[2:07:05] it he says we know it today as the law
[2:07:09] of
[2:07:11] contrast that where there is good there
[2:07:14] is
[2:07:15] evil where there is right there is wrong
[2:07:20] and we will never know matter matter
[2:07:22] what our environment may be ever be able
[2:07:26] to shake ourselves from the presence of
[2:07:33] either did you did that settle
[2:07:38] in that's the way it is Paul said when I
[2:07:41] would do good evil is present with me
[2:07:44] you'll never be able to shake yourself
[2:07:48] from the presence of the two being there
[2:07:52] and they're both
[2:07:54] talking and they're both
[2:08:01] pulling and this is the most desperate
[2:08:03] hour that we've ever lived
[2:08:06] in and the most perilous time that we've
[2:08:10] ever lived in where just our spiritual
[2:08:14] growth I'm not talking our Salvation I'm
[2:08:18] talking our spiritual growth reaching
[2:08:22] our potential as the Sons and Daughters
[2:08:25] of God being able to change things that
[2:08:28] are around us by the faith that's in Us
[2:08:32] by the speaking of God's word and the
[2:08:34] faith to believe that God keeps his
[2:08:40] word not just an outward
[2:08:43] appearance but a living Fountain of the
[2:08:46] Holy Spirit moving within your life
[2:08:52] and not have it be a
[2:08:56] group but having it be a personal
[2:09:01] possession God speaks to
[2:09:06] me and I'm not ashamed of
[2:09:13] it he
[2:09:16] said he
[2:09:18] said because Paul said when I would do
[2:09:21] good then evil is present The Sinner
[2:09:24] will never be able to shake away from
[2:09:27] the Christian the Christian from The
[2:09:30] Sinner there will be a witness there of
[2:09:35] right and a testimony of wrong always
[2:09:39] and you make your choice you have to
[2:09:42] take one side or the other
[2:09:51] and so we know that in our
[2:09:54] Bible studies and teachings we know that
[2:09:58] every Revival has
[2:10:01] twins there's there's always these two
[2:10:05] Spirits are always present the wrong and
[2:10:08] the right in our day it's even a little
[2:10:12] more treacherous if I could use that
[2:10:15] word because in our day we have the
[2:10:18] lukewarm come on
[2:10:22] true not just the hot and
[2:10:25] cold not just the right and the wrong
[2:10:30] but in our day we have the
[2:10:32] lukewarm just that one that's a mixture
[2:10:36] of a little hot and a little cold just
[2:10:40] that luk Warmness and and God is trying
[2:10:43] to tell his elected church if you're
[2:10:46] lukewarm I will spill thee out of my
[2:10:50] mouth and in other words that's not what
[2:10:53] I want to be tasting that's not what I
[2:10:56] want to be fellowshipping with God don't
[2:10:58] want to fellowship with you as a
[2:11:00] lukewarm believer he wants to fellowship
[2:11:03] with you as a believing son and daughter
[2:11:06] of God that believes every promise in
[2:11:09] the books for
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:13] me he wants to have fellowship with you
[2:11:16] like
[2:11:17] that he wants to have confidence in you
[2:11:21] and you have confidence in him he wants
[2:11:24] you to stand up and say I'm his son and
[2:11:27] he's my
[2:11:31] father not walking around to half
[2:11:37] doubt always feeling
[2:11:39] short always feeling hungry always
[2:11:43] starved out on the
[2:11:46] inside always feeling empty
[2:11:51] how
[2:11:53] what you can have refrigerator full of
[2:11:59] food and starve to
[2:12:07] death he's
[2:12:09] speaking
[2:12:12] here of Jacob and
[2:12:15] Esau he said before the either one was
[2:12:19] born God said love Jacob and I hate Esau
[2:12:24] before either of the children were born
[2:12:27] and we know that he said that it's not
[2:12:29] by works but that the law of election
[2:12:32] might stand amen so how ought we to
[2:12:41] feel do you ever stop when you read
[2:12:44] these messages and just
[2:12:47] stop how ought must we to feel
[2:12:52] I'm asking you next morning how after
[2:12:54] what you just
[2:12:55] hered how
[2:12:58] ought should we
[2:13:00] feel how should we be feel did it speak
[2:13:03] to
[2:13:06] you did it move you did it change you
[2:13:10] did it raise a something within your
[2:13:13] heart did it say to you I'm needy I'm
[2:13:15] not doing this I'm falling short here or
[2:13:19] Have We Become d all of
[2:13:29] hearing it's more than just passing
[2:13:33] play it's
[2:13:38] hearing how much do we ought to feel
[2:13:52] someone who has God speak to you and
[2:13:55] invite you to come to his table and to
[2:13:59] his home and be his son or daughter
[2:14:04] there's nothing so great as that what
[2:14:09] has God done to
[2:14:11] you he went out and found you he went
[2:14:15] out and called you he put your name on
[2:14:17] the Lamb's Book of Life and now he's
[2:14:20] invited you to his house to
[2:14:25] Feast he's got so much for
[2:14:29] you and he says
[2:14:32] and you know so there's nothing greater
[2:14:35] than that these two boys if you will
[2:14:37] notice their Natures one of them was a
[2:14:40] spiritual man that was Jacob and the
[2:14:43] carnal man was Esau and they were both
[2:14:47] religious and that same thing had has
[2:14:51] took place all down Through the Ages the
[2:14:54] carnal and the
[2:14:59] spiritual now we're wanting God to speak
[2:15:01] to us not to condemn us but to correct
[2:15:06] us yes if we're we're on one side he
[2:15:10] said you have to make your
[2:15:12] choice you've got to move from what's
[2:15:15] wrong to what's
[2:15:18] right you've got to remove move from
[2:15:21] what's lukewarm to what's
[2:15:24] hot You' got to move from from lack of
[2:15:29] dedication to sincere dedication this is
[2:15:33] what he's saying he's trying to say
[2:15:35] we've got to make a move it it's time to
[2:15:38] climb up higher in faith it's time to
[2:15:40] get more dedicated it's it's time to
[2:15:43] change our lives we've got into a rut we
[2:15:46] become
[2:15:48] dull am
[2:15:52] and I say thank you
[2:15:57] God and you hear what he said he said if
[2:16:00] you'd wait and listen to God every time
[2:16:02] we do things that we don't got that
[2:16:05] clear voice from God we make a mess out
[2:16:08] of it I'm tired of making mess out of
[2:16:11] things I want to see God doing it in my
[2:16:14] life I want to see it's the hand of God
[2:16:17] I want to see it's God's way I want to
[2:16:20] live in a world world where God's
[2:16:27] moving not a a Revival
[2:16:32] meeting but A
[2:16:37] Life That's
[2:16:39] Supernatural we're a supernatural people
[2:16:43] we come from a supernatural God and we
[2:16:46] have a supernatural
[2:16:49] promises that's what we want to be a
[2:16:51] part of listen to what he
[2:16:58] says he says Esau represented the man of
[2:17:03] the
[2:17:04] earth natural
[2:17:09] religious in
[2:17:11] inclined religiously
[2:17:17] inclined he's inclined to religion
[2:17:21] religion's a part of his
[2:17:24] life he reads his Bible he
[2:17:31] prays he's got a good moral
[2:17:36] standard look at
[2:17:38] them and now we have a voice in our day
[2:17:42] telling the church there's something
[2:17:44] beyond
[2:17:48] that each of you
[2:17:52] prophet of God when he opened this tape
[2:17:53] he said this is for little boys this is
[2:17:56] for little girls this is for big boys
[2:17:59] this is for little
[2:18:01] girls oh he wasn't really changing uh
[2:18:05] trying to cut it out just for old
[2:18:09] people listen
[2:18:13] beautiful he says he was religious and
[2:18:17] kind but never
[2:18:19] able it wasn't in him to do it he
[2:18:24] couldn't do it he never was in him to be
[2:18:29] able to climb up past the things of the
[2:18:35] world the carnal
[2:18:39] things he just never
[2:18:42] could climb into that
[2:18:46] place where he could hear God
[2:18:52] he he could do everything
[2:18:55] else but to climb into that
[2:18:58] spot where he could climb above the
[2:19:01] things of the world climb above the
[2:19:04] voices of the world you just heard
[2:19:07] it do you understand what you just
[2:19:10] listen
[2:19:11] to he says there's too many voices too
[2:19:14] many distractions too many things of the
[2:19:17] world too many things taking your time
[2:19:19] too many things now he's saying now Esau
[2:19:22] he could never climb past
[2:19:27] that he can never break
[2:19:31] away from the cares of life he can never
[2:19:35] break away from the fear of protecting
[2:19:38] his own Survival he could never step out
[2:19:42] into the Realms of Faith as long as he
[2:19:44] had control of it as long as he can put
[2:19:47] his hands on it as long as that he could
[2:19:51] feel that he was in
[2:19:52] control he never could climb behind
[2:19:58] that now
[2:20:00] listen we're invited to climb beyond
[2:20:06] that we're
[2:20:09] elected to climb beyond that but we
[2:20:13] become dull of hearing
[2:20:41] Jacob he wanted spiritual
[2:20:46] things there was one thing that burned
[2:20:48] in Jacob he wanted that
[2:20:54] Birthright you understand he wanted that
[2:20:57] voice to talk to
[2:20:59] him he wanted to be in that
[2:21:03] Fellowship he wanted to be in that place
[2:21:06] that meant more to him than anything
[2:21:11] else that's what drove
[2:21:14] him now look at Esau he can never climb
[2:21:18] above it but Jacob he wanted
[2:21:22] it and if you would compare the two
[2:21:25] Jacob was Sir
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:30] planner what what it's what beats in
[2:21:32] your
[2:21:34] heart he says now pay close attention to
[2:21:37] the scriptures now on this subject
[2:21:40] because I'm I'm sure it will help you
[2:21:44] now not everyone that saith Lord Lord
[2:21:48] will enter into
[2:21:51] will enter in but the one that doth the
[2:21:55] will of My Father which is in
[2:21:59] heaven that's a
[2:22:02] very immense
[2:22:06] statement that I would like to go down a
[2:22:11] road just a moment with you if you
[2:22:16] would give me the time amen
[2:22:23] not
[2:22:24] everyone that does all these
[2:22:28] works that lays hands on the
[2:22:31] sick that gives
[2:22:35] good does good
[2:22:37] deeds and excuse me does all these great
[2:22:41] things will enter the kingdom of heaven
[2:22:44] but him that doth the will of my
[2:22:49] father could I say it this way but to
[2:22:52] him that have taken the time to hear
[2:22:59] him you can do all these other
[2:23:02] things and never hear him you can do all
[2:23:06] these other things and never go to that
[2:23:08] sacred closet that side of the road that
[2:23:12] place in the woods that place down the
[2:23:14] river you can do all these things by
[2:23:17] instruction but never get to that place
[2:23:20] where he spoke to you and you carried
[2:23:24] out his
[2:23:28] will remember religions a
[2:23:32] covering everybody covered themselves
[2:23:36] with the wedding
[2:23:37] gown and now he's talking to a people
[2:23:40] because he wants to bring this people to
[2:23:43] a higher
[2:23:45] place he already knows your
[2:23:48] Believers he already already knows you
[2:23:51] believe the word of God he already knows
[2:23:53] you believe in the pillar of fire he
[2:23:56] already knows you know the Seven Seals
[2:23:58] are open he already knows you know the
[2:24:00] son of man has been revealed in this day
[2:24:04] but now he wants to take you
[2:24:09] higher he wants to bring you to that
[2:24:12] place where you go into that secret
[2:24:14] place you go beond that Veil you go into
[2:24:18] that chamber and you come out with thus
[2:24:21] saith the
[2:24:27] Lord that's what he's looking
[2:24:30] for he's got church full of church
[2:24:36] members he wants the cream of the crop
[2:24:39] to come
[2:24:40] up he wants that OB obedient elect lady
[2:24:45] to rise to the
[2:24:48] surface somebody with confidence
[2:24:51] not always wondering whether they're in
[2:24:54] or whether they're out they've settled
[2:24:56] that at Calvary they know their sins are
[2:24:59] forgiven they become different
[2:25:04] people you know if we wait along around
[2:25:08] for everybody to catch up none of us are
[2:25:11] going to go anywhere that's
[2:25:16] right it's time that the elect steps up
[2:25:21] to the call of their hour the call in
[2:25:25] their life their own position and if the
[2:25:29] other elect they will grow in their own
[2:25:35] season but we're trying to make it a
[2:25:38] Group
[2:25:40] movement you're not responsible to a
[2:25:43] group you're responsible to God and God
[2:25:47] alone and that's a quote
[2:25:56] he says that's the way it is with the
[2:25:58] spiritual believer today I want you to
[2:26:01] couch this if you would allow
[2:26:04] me he doesn't care how much you're laugh
[2:26:08] at
[2:26:09] him how much fun you
[2:26:12] make how
[2:26:15] ridiculous he has to act to the carnal
[2:26:18] mind
[2:26:20] his only objective is the
[2:26:26] birthright he wants to get to
[2:26:31] God because it's born in him he can't
[2:26:38] help
[2:26:40] it so we're talking about this spiritual
[2:26:44] believer we're talking about this person
[2:26:47] and wasn't it amazing the story of of
[2:26:50] Moses how he' done all these things but
[2:26:53] yet he still hadn't meant
[2:26:55] God what hadn't he
[2:26:58] got he hadn't got an order from God he
[2:27:01] hadn't got the purpose of his life he
[2:27:04] didn't come to the place where he knew
[2:27:06] his calling was what that what that he
[2:27:09] should do he was a
[2:27:12] Believer but one day he got
[2:27:17] attracted to a bush and when he got
[2:27:21] there when he took time to go out of his
[2:27:24] way to climb that mountain to find that
[2:27:29] presence when he got in that presence
[2:27:31] God
[2:27:32] spoke
[2:27:38] Hallelujah made him
[2:27:40] different changed everything it was and
[2:27:44] what did he say he said one word from
[2:27:46] that Bush was more knew more about God
[2:27:50] than all the 40 years he
[2:27:57] studied just think of
[2:27:59] it you say oh that's for preachers no
[2:28:02] it's
[2:28:04] not he said it was for
[2:28:07] you fact some people need to get in the
[2:28:10] presence of God so they can tell the
[2:28:11] preachers a few
[2:28:16] things no Elite group
[2:28:20] no big eyes no little 's there's thus
[2:28:23] saith the Lord and that settles
[2:28:27] it you don't ever have to worry about if
[2:28:30] you get in his presence that he's going
[2:28:33] to say something different than what's
[2:28:35] on this books in these
[2:28:37] tapes no no you don't have to worry
[2:28:39] don't worry about that in fact you'll
[2:28:41] find out that it's very Vindication of
[2:28:44] everything that's been spoken this what
[2:28:46] he said he wants to get to God cuz it's
[2:28:50] born in him he can't help it there
[2:28:54] there's a thirst in
[2:28:56] there there there there's something in
[2:28:59] there so just think of it if I could
[2:29:01] just draw a little illustration there's
[2:29:04] two
[2:29:06] worlds here's the world that Esau was in
[2:29:10] he couldn't climb out of that
[2:29:13] world and that world was a world of of
[2:29:17] census of the five senses
[2:29:20] it was the world of what he could
[2:29:23] see touch hear
[2:29:25] smell that controlled his life it was a
[2:29:29] world of
[2:29:31] education and knowledge and
[2:29:34] civilization everything that was around
[2:29:37] him everything that was affecting him
[2:29:40] everything he saw everything he felt
[2:29:42] everything he perceived in his mind that
[2:29:46] world ruled him
[2:29:50] and he couldn't break out of
[2:29:53] it he was stuck in that
[2:29:57] world but yet here was
[2:30:01] Jacob and there was something burning in
[2:30:03] his heart that there was another
[2:30:09] world another
[2:30:11] existence may I say it like this another
[2:30:16] Eden another realm where things weren't
[2:30:20] as they seemed to be it was the world of
[2:30:23] the
[2:30:25] Unseen and and that world was governed
[2:30:28] by the word of
[2:30:31] God and it took Faith to reveal this
[2:30:37] world Faith cometh by hearing and
[2:30:40] hearing by the word of God it took the
[2:30:43] word of God to
[2:30:46] reveal to him this world it took the
[2:30:50] burning bush it took Moses pursuing it
[2:30:54] and getting away and coming into the
[2:30:57] presence of that burning bush that God
[2:31:00] revealed to Moses that there was another
[2:31:03] world where he could take a stick and go
[2:31:07] kill them all
[2:31:14] Hallelujah that's the world that we're
[2:31:16] called to live
[2:31:18] in not the world world we think
[2:31:22] is we can't let what we think what we
[2:31:26] see what we F feel govern us we've got
[2:31:31] to break free from it we've got to come
[2:31:34] into His presence and hear his word and
[2:31:38] act on
[2:31:41] it but you'll never look for
[2:31:44] it if you don't believe it
[2:31:47] is without faith it's impossible to
[2:31:51] please God for they must be believe that
[2:31:54] God is and a rewarder of them that
[2:31:58] diligently seek
[2:32:04] him he wanted that
[2:32:07] Birthright that's what he
[2:32:09] wanted and a spiritual man today and a
[2:32:13] spiritual woman that's elected
[2:32:16] predestinated of God to come to eternal
[2:32:19] life
[2:32:20] if they have to sell everything they
[2:32:24] got if they have to take their names off
[2:32:28] every Church book in the
[2:32:31] nation they still want that
[2:32:38] Birthright we'll get to that Birthright
[2:32:40] in just a
[2:32:42] second if the only thing that matter
[2:32:45] it's the only thing that matters to them
[2:32:48] just get that that
[2:32:51] Birthright that's all no matter how what
[2:32:55] level they have to come
[2:32:57] on if they have to get down to the Altar
[2:33:01] and cry boohoo if they have to
[2:33:04] run through the place to go back and
[2:33:08] make things
[2:33:10] right and sell what they got or give
[2:33:14] away everything they have to become a
[2:33:16] pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter
[2:33:20] they want the birthright that's all
[2:33:24] they're interested in the birthright you
[2:33:28] don't blame them people they can't help
[2:33:31] it they were predestinated to that
[2:33:34] elected to
[2:33:36] it so we talk about
[2:33:41] election but what are we elected
[2:33:44] to we're elected to the
[2:33:48] birthright what is the
[2:33:50] birthright it's not the world of this
[2:33:53] world it's God's
[2:33:57] world we're the children of another
[2:34:00] kingdom we're Believers in another word
[2:34:03] we live by The Promise by these great
[2:34:06] and precious promises we're partakers of
[2:34:09] divine nature we're stuck here and we've
[2:34:12] got to find
[2:34:16] something that brings us from the
[2:34:20] bondage of this world and the sensus and
[2:34:23] our mental conditions into that realm of
[2:34:27] Faith peace
[2:34:32] Joy there's got to be
[2:34:37] something that does
[2:34:39] it and that's what ja has he wanted to
[2:34:44] get God he wanted to get to
[2:34:47] God that that that that's all and and
[2:34:51] you'll never see this world unless God
[2:34:55] opens it up to
[2:34:58] you that's right if not you'll make a
[2:35:01] false
[2:35:03] image of what you think God
[2:35:07] is you you'll come up with a a a false
[2:35:11] evidence of what it
[2:35:13] is it'll be a momentary High it'll be an
[2:35:18] excitement it'll be anything but this
[2:35:21] world we're talking about is a world
[2:35:23] where God speaks to you and you speak to
[2:35:33] him
[2:35:35] Jacob wanted it he wanted it with all
[2:35:39] his
[2:35:41] heart and if you want something you've
[2:35:45] got to pursue it
[2:35:51] Jacob wanted that verth right he was
[2:35:53] willing to do anything for
[2:35:58] it it meant everything to
[2:36:01] him I've got to have
[2:36:04] it I've got to have this world I've got
[2:36:08] to have these blessings I've got to have
[2:36:11] that
[2:36:12] relationship where religion isn't in
[2:36:15] between me and God I want to sit down at
[2:36:19] his table table I want to sit across
[2:36:21] from him I want to wait for him until
[2:36:24] it's like honeysuckle in the morning do
[2:36:29] until he speaks to me and I become
[2:36:35] different but if you're dull of hearing
[2:36:38] you don't even pursue it
[2:36:42] anymore as long as you got your religion
[2:36:44] in your job
[2:36:50] we wonder what what it is we're taking
[2:36:52] care of
[2:36:55] first are we taking care of our
[2:36:58] flesh are we taking care of our needs
[2:37:02] and yet the word of God said I've never
[2:37:04] seen a righteous man beg
[2:37:07] bread I've never seen the man that's
[2:37:10] pursued the kingdom of God with all his
[2:37:13] heart that God didn't take care of them
[2:37:21] but Esau as religious as he could be he
[2:37:23] could never let
[2:37:27] go he can never cast themselves
[2:37:30] completely into the presence of the word
[2:37:33] of God and say God
[2:37:37] speak you've got to get to that place
[2:37:39] where you're not ashamed to go before
[2:37:42] him and say Lord these are all my
[2:37:45] sins uh I just like the the Great
[2:37:49] Prophet
[2:37:51] did he finally went into the temple and
[2:37:54] said I'm a
[2:37:58] sinner I live unrighteous I live with
[2:38:01] unrighteous people our lips are
[2:38:05] profane but I want to C call into
[2:38:09] another
[2:38:11] level I want to hear you
[2:38:15] speak if you're going to want something
[2:38:18] you got to pursue it
[2:38:22] and we heard what our messenger
[2:38:25] said you got to set aside the
[2:38:29] time you got to get your heart right you
[2:38:33] got to make an effort and you hear what
[2:38:35] he said I don't care if you're a
[2:38:39] prostitute God wants to speak to
[2:38:44] you Lord he's already laid a sacrifice
[2:38:47] for your sins if you'll confess your
[2:38:50] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[2:38:52] them all he wants you to do is go and
[2:38:56] knock on the
[2:39:01] door come unto me all year heavy laden
[2:39:04] I'll give you rest knock and it shall be
[2:39:07] open in this last day if you'll knock
[2:39:10] I'll invite you in and I'll eat the
[2:39:14] evening meal with
[2:39:18] you don't let whatever it is in the
[2:39:21] world keep you from climbing the
[2:39:26] mountain don't let your
[2:39:29] failures
[2:39:31] your
[2:39:33] battles the voices of the world keep you
[2:39:37] from entering into the realm that he
[2:39:40] wants you and he's inviting you every
[2:39:44] step you take towards him he sprinkles
[2:39:46] you with his blood
[2:39:50] like The Great Speckled
[2:39:53] Bird every step you
[2:39:56] take holy holy there's a blood sacrifice
[2:40:01] you confess your sins he's faithful and
[2:40:04] just you turn every stone you go through
[2:40:07] every part of your life you say Lord I'm
[2:40:10] not worthy but I want it I desire it I'm
[2:40:15] pursuing it it's all that I want I'm
[2:40:19] want that
[2:40:23] Birthright I want that
[2:40:26] Birthright I want whatever comes with
[2:40:30] this other
[2:40:32] world that's what I want I want to
[2:40:34] pursue
[2:40:36] it Jacob wanted that
[2:40:40] Birthright what comes with a Birthright
[2:40:43] what is a
[2:40:44] Birthright is the
[2:40:47] inheritance that you have
[2:40:51] because of your
[2:40:56] birth when were you
[2:41:01] birthed you were birthed in the mind of
[2:41:04] God before the foundations of the
[2:41:07] world and
[2:41:09] yet we've heard that so much we become
[2:41:13] dull of
[2:41:17] hearing everybody just still B battleing
[2:41:19] the world battling the world battling
[2:41:21] Satan fighting with
[2:41:24] Satan and yet you're a child of the
[2:41:28] king when that Old Devil come to Jesus
[2:41:31] you know what he said get behind me
[2:41:33] Satan it is written Thou shalt not tempt
[2:41:37] the Lord thy God how about the bride
[2:41:40] saying get behind me Satan Thou shalt
[2:41:42] not tempt the elect of the Living God
[2:41:51] oh know we just enter into a big fight a
[2:41:54] big
[2:41:56] battle I I just heard it somewhere the
[2:41:58] other day prophet of God said don't
[2:42:00] fight don't fight with
[2:42:03] them enter into his rest don't fight
[2:42:06] don't
[2:42:08] fight take your
[2:42:11] inheritance your
[2:42:14] Birthright you don't think you got a
[2:42:16] Birthright
[2:42:22] why don't you find
[2:42:26] out why don't you make your way to the
[2:42:29] altar why don't you make your way to his
[2:42:31] presence why don't you get into a prayer
[2:42:34] closet and get it
[2:42:37] settled you might come out of there
[2:42:39] saying you know I'm a
[2:42:41] rat I got to run to and fro and make
[2:42:45] everything right
[2:42:50] but I'll do whatever it
[2:42:52] takes I'll do whatever it
[2:42:56] takes to be back in his
[2:43:11] presence but look the church
[2:43:14] natural it's just the church carnal
[2:43:17] they'll never be able to get above that
[2:43:20] little thing of I join church if I go to
[2:43:25] church if I do the best I can that's all
[2:43:29] God requires now that's the same thing
[2:43:33] Cain done he went and made an altar he
[2:43:37] made a sacrifice brought the fruit of
[2:43:40] his land and said here it is God that's
[2:43:43] the best I've got take it or leave it
[2:43:47] that's the way the carnal believer
[2:43:50] believes today Lord I'll go to church
[2:43:53] I'll join the best group that I can I'll
[2:43:57] pay my dues to the church I'll do what's
[2:44:01] right now here's the best I can do I'll
[2:44:05] help buy some coal for the widow or I'll
[2:44:10] give the children some clothing them's
[2:44:13] all right nothing against it but
[2:44:17] that's but that's it that's all if you
[2:44:21] want to take it if you
[2:44:25] don't you have to take it now that's the
[2:44:29] attitude of the church
[2:44:32] carnal
[2:44:34] today I'm doing everything I can
[2:44:40] do I pay my ti I go to church I take
[2:44:45] care of
[2:44:47] people that's all them what what what
[2:44:49] else can I do
[2:44:52] Lord here it is it's all I've
[2:44:56] got take it or else I don't know what
[2:44:59] else I can
[2:45:02] do that's the sign of a
[2:45:04] people who have become dull of
[2:45:08] hearing the word's not affecting them
[2:45:17] anymore there there they're they're not
[2:45:20] moved to
[2:45:23] that but listen what
[2:45:25] Jacob he says but
[2:45:28] the the the church spiritual Able by
[2:45:33] Revelation by Grace he's seen beyond
[2:45:39] that and that's what I ask are we seen
[2:45:42] beyond
[2:45:43] that we've not done anything in this
[2:45:46] message but set up a great big
[2:45:51] Camp we're afraid to go
[2:45:54] forward people have used the voice of
[2:45:56] our prophet and the tapes to bind us in
[2:46:00] fear you better not move you better not
[2:46:04] seek God you better not have the spirit
[2:46:06] of God you just better
[2:46:10] listen but that's never been what the
[2:46:13] word of God said it said be not hearers
[2:46:16] of the word only but be doers of the
[2:46:23] word and I'm not going to try to preach
[2:46:26] some place else CU it's not given my
[2:46:29] charge but my charge is to to let you
[2:46:33] know that you can rise up above a carnal
[2:46:38] mind and a churchgoing life and a life
[2:46:42] of Works into a place where God speaks
[2:46:46] to you
[2:46:49] am and you hear
[2:46:52] him and you recognize it's him and you
[2:46:57] act on
[2:47:00] it that's what's given to
[2:47:03] you that's your
[2:47:05] inheritance that's the
[2:47:08] birthright that what you have by being a
[2:47:12] child of God and having your name
[2:47:15] written on the book of life you have
[2:47:17] access
[2:47:21] to every promise in the
[2:47:26] book every promise in the book is mine
[2:47:30] every chapter every verse every line
[2:47:34] that's the birthright that's my
[2:47:36] inheritance I serve a s Supernatural
[2:47:41] God and that Birthright meant more to
[2:47:44] him than anything else
[2:47:50] what was what comes with that
[2:47:53] Birthright what's the
[2:47:56] inheritance of being a child of God what
[2:48:00] was the
[2:48:01] inheritance that you
[2:48:05] have that you were in his thinking
[2:48:08] before the foundation of the world what
[2:48:11] does that
[2:48:12] mean what comes with that
[2:48:19] well I want to
[2:48:24] know I want to know how do I get from
[2:48:28] this world to that
[2:48:33] world he said you got to wait on the
[2:48:37] Lord you've got to set aside the time to
[2:48:41] come into His presence and you've got to
[2:48:44] hear him
[2:48:45] speak he's got to open it up to you
[2:48:52] you've got to
[2:48:54] stop and realize wait a minute this
[2:48:58] world is swallowing me
[2:49:01] up it's keeping me from all my
[2:49:05] inheritance is keeping me from my
[2:49:08] Birthright the things that are
[2:49:11] mine because of who that I
[2:49:16] am that's not something you
[2:49:20] earn when I get my inheritance it's not
[2:49:23] what I earned it's what my parents
[2:49:26] earned for
[2:49:28] me it's what they left
[2:49:32] me what did Jesus earn for me at Calvary
[2:49:36] what is it that he left me what what did
[2:49:40] he give me what did he say was
[2:49:43] mine he said little children it's the
[2:49:47] father's good pleasure to give you the
[2:49:50] kingdom I go to prepare a place for you
[2:49:53] if it were not so I would not tell you I
[2:49:56] come
[2:49:59] again that where I am you may be
[2:50:05] also not future where I am now you can
[2:50:10] be like me I'll be with you even in you
[2:50:14] till the end all the father hath given
[2:50:17] me
[2:50:19] is
[2:50:21] yours just think of the
[2:50:23] birthright the benefits The Inheritance
[2:50:27] the
[2:50:28] blessings the
[2:50:30] power the life the discernment the
[2:50:35] fruits the revelations the
[2:50:38] understandings all the goodness and
[2:50:40] grace and
[2:50:42] mercy it's all there right but you got
[2:50:46] to pursue it
[2:50:51] you got to go after
[2:50:57] it just like Elijah and
[2:51:02] Elijah he pursued it he went after
[2:51:07] it here we've got a whole
[2:51:10] world of the word of
[2:51:14] God but we've got to come to the place
[2:51:18] the only way you get there is through
[2:51:24] instruction you've got to be told how to
[2:51:29] get
[2:51:32] there I can preach the
[2:51:34] gospel but each one of you has a key and
[2:51:39] a road that you must
[2:51:42] find each one of you has a door that you
[2:51:46] must open
[2:51:48] each one of you have got to come to a
[2:51:51] place where you're willing to move
[2:51:54] things out of your life you're willing
[2:51:56] to apply the token you're willing to get
[2:51:58] to that spot where you just don't
[2:52:01] believe it but you finally come in
[2:52:03] contact with him and you hear his
[2:52:11] voice that takes a lot of
[2:52:15] work it takes a lot of effort
[2:52:19] it's not he easy to hear the voice of
[2:52:21] God that's why the church world has
[2:52:24] supplied so many
[2:52:27] substitutes I'm
[2:52:38] closing he says
[2:52:40] it he
[2:52:42] says and it testified of his
[2:52:45] righteousness to God he offered a more
[2:52:48] excess thing the same thing took place
[2:52:51] with ishma and Isaac one was flesh the
[2:52:55] other one was Spirit one of them bonds
[2:52:58] woman the other one free woman it
[2:53:01] happens the same thing to Israel and the
[2:53:04] moabs two great churches coming together
[2:53:07] and when Israel was waiting to go into
[2:53:11] their promised Place Church spiritual
[2:53:14] Jacob's People Israel on the road
[2:53:18] Esau's people meant them the moabites
[2:53:22] church powerful and the great leaders of
[2:53:25] the church balum and came down to curse
[2:53:30] his brother but he found out that he
[2:53:33] could not curse his brother he failed
[2:53:36] with the blindness of his eyes to see
[2:53:40] the predestinated plan and to see the
[2:53:45] word of
[2:53:46] God first
[2:53:49] Faith cometh by
[2:53:52] hearing
[2:53:54] hearing of the word of
[2:53:59] God then the
[2:54:02] believer hears it recognizes it and acts
[2:54:07] on it the carnal man will never hear it
[2:54:12] the sound of it but never hear means to
[2:54:17] understand look at you're looking at
[2:54:22] something to see
[2:54:24] it it is to understand it except a man
[2:54:28] be born again he cannot understand the
[2:54:32] kingdom of
[2:54:36] God don't get being born again mixed up
[2:54:39] with an emotional
[2:54:43] experience you're born again when that
[2:54:45] seed in you that part of you is so
[2:54:49] hungry for
[2:54:51] God so hungry to get to God so hungry to
[2:54:56] make contact with
[2:54:59] God what did he do what did what did
[2:55:02] Jacob do he wanted to get to God what
[2:55:05] did he do he wrestled with
[2:55:09] them he fought for
[2:55:11] it he prayed for it he fasted for it
[2:55:19] he he didn't want to know somebody
[2:55:20] else's experience that's the trouble
[2:55:23] with the church we want everybody to
[2:55:24] have experience God don't have clones
[2:55:27] he's got Sons and Daughters who have men
[2:55:32] them they wrestled with them the hunger
[2:55:36] in their
[2:55:37] heart drove them to
[2:55:41] God I've got to hear from you I got to
[2:55:44] feel you I've got to touch you you've
[2:55:47] got to speak to
[2:55:50] me I'm done
[2:55:56] talking if you don't talk to me today I
[2:55:59] like that guy I forget his name he
[2:56:02] plowing the field and finally he got
[2:56:04] down he said God if you don't give me
[2:56:06] your spirit you're going to find a bag
[2:56:08] of bones right
[2:56:16] here we're not talking about
[2:56:19] salvation we're talking about who you
[2:56:22] are what your inheritance is what your
[2:56:25] Birthright is what it is that God wants
[2:56:28] to do for
[2:56:30] you but you got to pursue it you got to
[2:56:34] wrestle for it you've got to get that
[2:56:39] blessing you don't care if it gives you
[2:56:42] a
[2:56:43] limp you don't care what it
[2:56:46] is you got got to have
[2:56:51] it and and you could be fine where you
[2:56:54] are but there's something in you I want
[2:56:57] to go higher there's another level and
[2:57:00] I'm trying to tell you something if I
[2:57:01] can put it as simply as I can you're not
[2:57:04] going to do it if you don't
[2:57:08] pray if you don't apply the
[2:57:11] token if you don't clean up your life if
[2:57:15] you don't get along with God if you
[2:57:17] don't wait on God if you don't hear his
[2:57:24] voice I'm preaching the gospel that is
[2:57:28] not a
[2:57:29] substitute for you and God talking it
[2:57:32] over
[2:57:39] yourself God will make it so for
[2:57:44] you he'll take you to the day you were
[2:57:47] born and walk you right up through your
[2:57:49] life he'll put the scrub brush to your
[2:57:52] mind he'll put the scrub brush to your
[2:57:54] heart he'll take every burden off of you
[2:57:58] he'll take every lie that was ever told
[2:58:00] on you off and you'll sitting there
[2:58:02] you'll be so
[2:58:05] free you'll be
[2:58:07] free you'll be changed you'll be
[2:58:11] different but what happens when you
[2:58:13] become dull of
[2:58:15] hearing you quit pursuing
[2:58:19] the
[2:58:22] birthright the birthright has an answer
[2:58:25] for every circumstance that you're
[2:58:29] in it's like
[2:58:31] saying I've got a will or I've got
[2:58:34] something and you never open it up to
[2:58:37] find what do I have in my inheritance
[2:58:41] for this situation that I'm in I am
[2:58:45] going to go set before the Lord
[2:58:50] oh let me say that
[2:58:52] again I am going to go set
[2:58:58] before the
[2:59:00] Lord little
[2:59:03] boys and little
[2:59:06] girls I am going to sit before the Lord
[2:59:10] I'm going to wait upon the Lord until he
[2:59:16] speaks and then when he
[2:59:19] speaks I Know that heaven and
[2:59:22] earth will pass away but his word will
[2:59:27] never pass
[2:59:29] away I've got it settled I've got it
[2:59:34] ended it's done for
[2:59:39] me Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[2:59:43] then the believer hears it recognizes
[2:59:45] and acts upon it and understands it
[2:59:49] except a man be born again he cannot
[2:59:51] enter the kingdom of God that's the way
[2:59:55] it is today they say it's a bunch of
[2:59:58] Holy Rollers a bunch of people who's
[3:00:01] this who's that the other but they
[3:00:04] failed to see it's the following the
[3:00:07] directions of the word of
[3:00:12] God what does a Believer do he follows
[3:00:16] instructions
[3:00:19] he
[3:00:21] follows the the
[3:00:29] directions how many have any
[3:00:35] directions he follows
[3:00:38] directions where do you get directions
[3:00:41] from it's like in the
[3:00:43] military what do you wait you wait for
[3:00:46] orders they give you orders and then
[3:00:48] what do you wait you wait for them
[3:00:50] whether they're going to change their
[3:00:51] mind or
[3:00:53] not and then when they say go you go
[3:00:56] when they say stop you
[3:00:59] stop I Fellowship man the other day said

[3:03:06] ourselves we've got to come to that
[3:03:08] great place in our
[3:03:11] lives where we start following
[3:03:13] directions
[3:03:18] not what you think he wants you to do
[3:03:22] but what he directs you to do can you
[3:03:25] imagine the concert that the Holy Spirit
[3:03:28] would be playing if each one of us was
[3:03:30] being directed by his Spirit doing what
[3:03:33] he told us to
[3:03:36] do I love it when someone comes said
[3:03:39] brother McGary I sat down in church and
[3:03:41] I read that scripture I just listened to
[3:03:44] that tape that's exactly what's on my
[3:03:46] heart what is that
[3:03:48] people that are looking for his
[3:03:51] voice do you hear me this morning I'm
[3:03:53] not condemning

[3:04:23] him hear ye
[3:04:27] him you can have all these great quotes
[3:04:31] and
[3:04:32] everything but when God quickens a quote
[3:04:35] to you you ought to bring that before
[3:04:37] his presence until he brings that quote
[3:04:40] and shows you where it needs to become
[3:04:44] alive in your life we've got a bunch of
[3:04:48] Standalone quotes out
[3:04:50] here he said this I believe it he said
[3:04:54] this I believe
[3:04:56] it but it's not making you
[3:04:59] different it's not changing the way we
[3:05:01] think we're not putting it into our
[3:05:04] lives this word is given to transform

[3:11:11] teeny
[3:11:14] thought but you said that Moses was in
[3:11:17] your presence for one minute and knew
[3:11:21] more about
[3:11:23] God in those two minutes than he ever
[3:11:26] did in all
[3:11:27] the time of his
[3:11:32] life Lord if you just give each of us
[3:11:35] just one
[3:11:39] minute just one touch on our
[3:11:42] heart Lord I can undo the things I've

[3:12:07] away from
[3:12:08] you I don't pray about how I spend your
[3:12:13] money
[3:12:17] I don't really
[3:12:20] consider what comes out of my
[3:12:26] mouth just rambling to and fro and going
[3:12:32] to work
[3:12:36] and almost become now I lay myself to
[3:12:41] sleep just some little prayer Lord
[3:12:47] but Lord You're you want more from us
[3:12:51] and you want to give us
[3:12:56] more Lord I I don't want to live on a
[3:12:58] hope so
[3:13:01] anymore I want to live by your
[3:13:04] voice and I want to hear your voice and
[3:13:08] Lord I don't know who has their hand
[3:13:09] lifted father but I lift my
[3:13:12] hand and I ask father that you help
[3:13:16] me that I never become too
[3:13:19] busy to get alone with you and hear your
[3:13:23] voice and I trust this morning Father
[3:13:26] that each person in the sincerity of
[3:13:29] their heart they realize that there's
[3:13:32] another
[3:13:33] world besides the world that this flesh
[3:13:36] is
[3:13:38] in there's another world to live
[3:13:42] by there's another dimension in Realm
[3:13:48] that's controlled by
[3:13:49] [Music]
[3:13:51] God and I'm here asking father that
[3:13:55] you translate us from the bondage of
[3:13:59] this world into the freedom of your word
[3:14:04] world in every hand that's raised in
[3:14:08] every heart that's
[3:14:10] bowed heavenly father I ask that you
[3:14:15] would take the d Ness of hearing from
[3:14:19] their
[3:14:20] hearts and let this word sink
[3:14:23] deep so that each person in here as an
[3:14:27] individual will act upon it they'll find
[3:14:31] that roadside they'll find that closet
[3:14:34] they'll find that place where they sit
[3:14:38] down and they press in your
[3:14:41] presence and then relax and hear your
[3:14:45] voice father speak to us as a pastor I
[3:14:49] ask it that you would Grant it for me
[3:14:52] personally and for all the sheep that
[3:14:55] you have placed into my hands father
[3:14:58] they're not my sheep they're your
[3:15:01] sheep and father they love your
[3:15:04] word and I trust this morning that
