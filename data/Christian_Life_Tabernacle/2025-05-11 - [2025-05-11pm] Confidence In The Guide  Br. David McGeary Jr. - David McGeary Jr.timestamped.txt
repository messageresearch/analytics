[29:41] junior.
[29:44] Amen. Oh, sometimes I saw like an eagle

[30:33] come and make the sun shine
[30:38] again. I know.
[30:45] Let's just approach the master together.
[30:47] Our gracious heavenly father, the
[30:49] greatest privilege is to know you. to
[30:51] know you as the one who's has calmed the
[30:53] storms of our life. And Father, who's
[30:56] called us your own. And Lord, that's
[30:58] truly the peace that passes
[30:59] understanding, Lord. When we sing, it's
[31:01] it's more than a song, Lord. It's a
[31:03] reality. And Father, we even know that
[31:06] nature itself obeys you, Lord. And we
[31:08] have a complete confidence in your love
[31:10] towards us. And Lord, as we've gathered
[31:13] here tonight, I just ask that you'd have
[31:14] preeminence amongst your people. Father,
[31:16] that you would be the one that communes
[31:18] with our hearts, Lord. After this
[31:20] morning's service, Lord, what a liberty
[31:22] we should have in you to recognize our
[31:24] position, that we are your bride,
[31:26] Father, that it's you that started the
[31:28] work. You're still pulling. You're still
[31:30] drawing, Father. That there's a place
[31:32] and a position that is ours that you've
[31:34] made possible. May we just enjoy this
[31:36] time of fellowship together, Lord. Be
[31:38] with all the mothers, Lord. each one and
[31:40] those who can be here, those who are
[31:42] even traveling on the road now to be in
[31:44] different places. Ask you just bless
[31:46] their travels and be with them in the
[31:47] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[31:49] Jesus Christ. We pray and ask these
[31:50] things. Amen. While you're standing, if
[31:53] you turn in your Bibles with me, I'm
[31:55] going to read out of First John. That's
[31:58] uh should be right before the book of
[31:59] Revelations. Tucked right in there. 1
[32:02] John chapter 2. We're just going to read
[32:04] a portion uh verse
[32:07] 27 uh through
[32:11] 28 or just verse 27.
[32:15] But the anointing which ye have received
[32:17] of him abideth in you, and ye not that
[32:21] any man teach you, but as the same
[32:24] anointing teacheth you all things and is
[32:27] truth, and is no lie, and even it hath
[32:31] taught you, ye shall abide in him. God
[32:34] bless you. You may be seated. Let's ask
[32:36] the Lord quicken that to you. The
[32:38] thought that I would like to fellowship
[32:39] with you on it, it just really struck my
[32:42] heart in different things this morning,
[32:43] but is confidence in the
[32:45] guide. You you have to recognize what it
[32:48] is that we possess and and what it is
[32:52] that uh the way that God would lead us
[32:54] and what we've come into possession of
[32:56] of this day is I believe God's provided
[32:58] way. I I would say that we've received
[33:01] the guide in our day as a prophetic
[33:04] ministry. The only thing that could tell
[33:06] you your day, your position, the hour
[33:07] you live in was absolutely ne a
[33:10] necessity that God would send Malachi
[33:13] 4:5, Elisha the prophet, the message of
[33:15] William Brandham, however you would
[33:17] refer to it, the message. But in the
[33:19] imparting of that, recognizing your day
[33:21] and your message, it would do no good if
[33:23] you didn't recognize what you've come
[33:25] into possession of that it's declared
[33:28] you to be a son of God. And I I would
[33:31] even say this is uh the proclamation of
[33:35] what the message says is possible of
[33:37] you. Says, I'm so glad that a man can so
[33:40] completely serve God till he the devil
[33:43] don't know what to do with him. That's
[33:45] right. Just obey God so completely till
[33:48] the devil said, "Oh my, get away. I
[33:50] don't want to hear it no more." That's
[33:52] right. You can do it so completely. So
[33:55] we have a promise in this day that you
[33:57] can so completely yield your vessel to
[34:00] God that the devil don't even know what
[34:02] to do with you. If it it the way I see
[34:04] it is when brother Brandon would take
[34:06] the rapture text. He says in the secret
[34:08] place of the pavilion you've hidden me.
[34:10] We've been ministered that entrance. You
[34:12] can be so hid away in Christ where the
[34:14] devil don't even know what to do with
[34:16] you. He's just he just looks at you and
[34:18] he says, "But I've thrown everything I
[34:20] can at him. I've I've shown confusion. I
[34:23] I've thrown his genetics. I've thrown
[34:26] his family history. I've thrown
[34:28] everything I can at him. Why doesn't he
[34:30] just accept that this promised land
[34:31] isn't for him? How come he can believe
[34:34] in the face of all the world and all the
[34:36] adversity,
[34:38] that he's a son of God? Doesn't he
[34:40] recognize he's earthbound,
[34:43] that he that he he's of this world and
[34:45] he can't obtain to the things of God?
[34:47] Why doesn't he accept my reality? It's
[34:50] because you've heard from a heavenly
[34:51] theophony. you you have you're obeying
[34:54] the word of God that's that proclaims to
[34:56] you what your land is and that you
[34:58] possess it and it is a inward guide. So
[35:02] what you possess is the spirit that will
[35:04] lead and guide you into all truth and
[35:06] righteousness. I felt a little rebuke
[35:08] this morning because my brother touched
[35:10] on if you go back and listen to the
[35:11] other church age old ministers, old
[35:14] church age messengers, you'll find that
[35:16] those people were living in a partial
[35:18] truth and you it will not satisfy you. A
[35:22] matter of fact, you actually feel regret
[35:24] that that was what they had to live
[35:25] under. And you could actually appreciate
[35:27] how all desired to live in this day.
[35:29] They all had glimpses of truth. They all
[35:32] did their best to walk in the truth and
[35:33] they and they they did face the
[35:35] challenge for their day. They did have
[35:37] an anointing that was to overcome the
[35:39] challenge of their day. But we stand in
[35:40] a day of full possession. We don't have
[35:43] to just settle for a partial victory,
[35:45] but we have a complete victory. We don't
[35:47] have to settle for part of the promised
[35:49] land, but we've been equipped to be able
[35:50] to look back and see everything, all the
[35:53] trials, all the adversities, everything
[35:54] that people have gone through and say,
[35:56] I'm not going to fall to that trap. The
[35:59] son of preditions exposed. He's not
[36:01] going to get me to rest in a place of
[36:03] religious complacency. I'm not going to
[36:05] accept an intellectual understanding of
[36:07] it, but I have to have a Holy Ghost
[36:10] quickening power of God in my life. I'm
[36:12] not just going to settle with an
[36:14] academic understanding of the message,
[36:16] but I'm going to wanted it to live in
[36:17] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[36:19] Ghost. I I'm not settled with just
[36:22] knowing the land from a from a map, but
[36:26] I want to go visit my mountain.
[36:28] I want to I want to apprehend it. I want
[36:30] to see what the view is from the
[36:32] mountaintop, sir. I don't want to just
[36:34] read about it as some poetry, but I want
[36:37] to experience it. And we've been given
[36:40] that. I mean, I I tell you what, brother
[36:42] Brandon would stand in the place where
[36:44] he would say he'd been to hell and he
[36:45] had been to heaven. And for him to be
[36:47] able to bring us back a vision, a future
[36:49] home of the heavenly bride to tell you
[36:51] what it's like, I want to be there. I
[36:54] don't want to miss it. So, we we
[36:57] actually have to recognize that there's
[36:59] a an enemy that wants to keep you from
[37:02] taking possession of everything that's
[37:03] yours. And and the possession is now.
[37:07] So, what is the Holy Ghost? It's the
[37:09] promised land. It it so we have not
[37:12] entered into the millennium. We haven't
[37:14] entered we're not done fighting, but we
[37:17] are been put in a place where there's
[37:18] battles to be fought and to be won. And
[37:21] and I would say that uh what you have to
[37:24] recognize too is is there's a there's a
[37:26] thirst and there's a desire. And the
[37:29] greater the desperation, the greater
[37:31] desire, the greater the contrast. So as
[37:33] you get into the spirit, as you would uh
[37:37] as you would start to recognize an
[37:40] eternal draw, I would say it starts to
[37:42] set a a a a void that only God can
[37:48] satisfy. And that's the most dangerous
[37:50] place for anybody to set is once they've
[37:52] made a decision for God. Once they've
[37:55] done once they've made a stand and say,
[37:56] "Lord, I recognize and in obedience to
[37:59] your word, I have done this." Now the
[38:01] get now you got the devil's attention.
[38:03] That's right. He's like, "Could that be
[38:07] could that be another one?" Now I' I've
[38:10] gotten many that come to this point of
[38:11] decision, but could this be a son of
[38:14] God?
[38:15] And so now I I I witnessed to this guy
[38:18] in Bise. He said, "David, the more God
[38:21] loves me, the more Satan offers me."
[38:26] He recognized that there's a pool that
[38:28] only God could satisfy. Every single
[38:30] time he comes up to that place, what do
[38:32] you think's there? Some other offer,
[38:36] some other supernatural satisfaction.
[38:38] What is it that's guiding you? Because
[38:41] that that is the point that you have to
[38:43] recognize that now you stand in the
[38:46] place of what guide are you going to
[38:47] accept?
[38:50] You you are now in the place that you
[38:52] are in a valley of decision
[38:55] and you need a guide and you have one.
[39:00] If you listen and you're honest with
[39:02] your heart, you have a guide.
[39:05] So, we're all sheep. We're all going to
[39:08] follow something.
[39:11] You are made to be led.
[39:14] You don't have an option. You will be
[39:17] led by something.
[39:19] And you have to know who's leading you.
[39:22] Who all wants to sign up to be in the
[39:24] DMER party?
[39:29] Sign me up. I feel that's still a great
[39:32] name to give the restaurant
[39:34] hostess is the DMER
[39:37] party. Anybody gets the joke? If those
[39:39] who don't know what the DMER party
[39:45] was,
[39:47] well, the short story is is it was a
[39:49] tragic story. Some of them survived, but
[39:52] they had a guide who misjudged the time
[39:55] in the season. And he thought they could
[39:57] make a mountain pass before winter set
[39:59] in. They settled for taking the easy
[40:01] way, the way that maybe was uh it just
[40:05] seemed the easy way. And so when they
[40:08] settled for having this guide take him
[40:10] the easy way, it was to their peril. It
[40:12] was to their detriment. It's one of the
[40:14] a very well doumented occurrence how
[40:17] they wintered it out, how they strived
[40:18] it. There's a lot of tells how when when
[40:20] the when there was people who recognized
[40:22] the DMER party was stranded, there's men
[40:24] who who sacrificed their lives and
[40:27] risked everything to get to those people
[40:29] to help him. So there in the midst of
[40:31] that tragedy, there's there's there's
[40:34] story stories that are pretty incredible
[40:36] about the love that a man has for
[40:39] another that he'll lay down his life
[40:40] that he'll risk everything to save
[40:42] someone else. And I believe that's the
[40:43] epitome of the character of Christ is
[40:45] when man's willing to risk their lives
[40:48] for others and and and to help someone
[40:50] that's in need. But what you have to
[40:52] recognize, I don't feel the man meant to
[40:54] lead them astray. Nobody knew the pearl
[40:56] that was ahead of them. But it's very
[40:58] important you recognize that there's a
[41:00] false guide. And a way seemth right unto
[41:03] a man, but the end thereof is death. And
[41:06] if you lean to your own understanding,
[41:09] there's death. There's death in the pot.
[41:12] just your the intellectual exercise of
[41:15] anything even those things which are
[41:17] good does not produce life. It has to
[41:20] have a quickening power. It has to have
[41:22] a Holy Ghost. It has to have the inward
[41:24] teacher. It has to have the guide
[41:26] because as we read in our
[41:28] text, the
[41:30] anointing which ye have received of him
[41:34] abideth in you. So, I love this because
[41:37] an anointing is an outward thing, but he
[41:40] goes ahead and summarizes it. It's not
[41:42] just an outward thing. It abideth in
[41:43] you. So what the effectual difference is
[41:46] is that the anointing abideth in you. I
[41:49] remember even as a young man be having
[41:51] experiences with God just and I feel
[41:54] it's the job question. You sit there and
[41:56] you go Lord I don't want to leave this.
[41:58] This is the most perfect sublime place.
[42:01] I don't want to even walk out of the
[42:02] church. I don't want to leave this
[42:04] atmosphere. I this is where I belong.
[42:07] This is the place for me. And when you
[42:10] recognize that that now dwells in you,
[42:13] that I will never leave you. I will not
[42:14] forsake you, but I'll be with you even
[42:16] in you, we have a a beautiful blessing
[42:19] and understanding that it is Christ that
[42:21] abides in you. It's not a third person
[42:23] of the trinity, but it's the Lord Jesus
[42:26] Christ with you, even in you. And he's
[42:30] promised he would never leave you. So it
[42:33] that's that's beyond your feeling.
[42:35] That's beyond your emotion. That's
[42:36] beyond your mind's physical ability to
[42:39] comprehend. And if you would recognize
[42:41] the presence of Christ with you, you
[42:44] would not do the things often that we do
[42:47] if you recognized he was
[42:49] there. So I believe that if you would
[42:51] accept the guide, he would be telling
[42:54] you, I'm with
[42:57] you. A guide is needed when you've never
[43:00] gone away before.
[43:02] So the the I would say maybe another way
[43:06] of alternating this around is pride
[43:08] would be the thing that says I got this.
[43:10] I don't need a guide. So pride has no
[43:13] need of a guide. Does that rhyme? Pride
[43:16] has no need of a guide. So when you
[43:18] write when if you think you do just do
[43:21] the math, okay? The men don't pull over,
[43:23] ask for directions, whatever. You know,
[43:25] there's a lot of things to but I want
[43:27] you to grasp on something. Let it sink
[43:29] in. If you haven't humbled yourself and
[43:31] say, "Lord, I do not have this." Then
[43:35] you do think you've got it and you're
[43:37] not accepting a guide. You may that's
[43:39] that that uh that have need of nothing
[43:42] mentality we spoke about the last time
[43:44] we ministered. But you have to recognize
[43:46] your dependence on the guide. When you
[43:50] wake up in the morning, the prayer
[43:51] should be, "Lord, lead my steps today.
[43:54] If I go the way I think I should go,
[43:58] no good will come of it." Maybe your
[43:59] your hand will preserve me, but I want
[44:01] to be a lifegiver. I want to be someone
[44:03] who shines a light. I don't want to just
[44:05] make my way through and make it because
[44:07] I'm going to make it, but I want to be
[44:08] the very source of life to somebody
[44:10] else. You can't do that without a guide
[44:13] because someone's following you.
[44:15] Someone's watching you. So, you are
[44:18] going to be the Christ to somebody.
[44:21] You're going to be somebody's guide. So,
[44:22] what do you want people to see? Christ
[44:24] in you. Okay. So that's what the very
[44:28] ability to impart eternal life is not
[44:30] your ability.
[44:33] That's Christ in you. So we want to
[44:35] recognize not only does the the guide
[44:39] leading uh impact me but it impacts
[44:43] everybody else around me.
[44:47] Amen.
[44:53] Ye have not need that any man teach you,
[44:56] but as the same anointing teacheth you
[44:58] all things, and is truth, and is no lie,
[45:01] and even as he that taught you, ye shall
[45:04] abide in him. Now, I I would say that
[45:08] there's there's probably those kids
[45:10] right now if they're quick, they're
[45:12] like, "Mom, dad, I have no need of
[45:14] homeschooling anymore because the
[45:16] scripture says I have no
[45:18] need." I that reminds me actually once I
[45:21] was converted I printed out a whole
[45:23] bunch of quotes and took it to my vice
[45:25] principal and told her how a woman
[45:26] shouldn't assurp authority over a man
[45:29] and
[45:34] uh a little zeal.
[45:37] Okay. So you could misapply this
[45:42] word and and say that you have no need
[45:45] of a teacher if you're just to carnally
[45:47] undertake this exercise. It's like,
[45:49] "Yes, I got the scripture I was looking
[45:52] for. I'm my own man now. I don't have
[45:55] need of anybody. Thank you, brother
[45:57] David. Can you stop here?" We're not
[46:00] stopping. So, in Ephesians 4:11, he
[46:03] says, "And he gave some apostles and
[46:05] some prophets and some evangelists and
[46:06] some pastors and teachers for the
[46:10] perfecting of the saints that work in
[46:11] the ministry of the edifying the body of
[46:13] Christ." Well, David, I thought you said
[46:14] you had no man teach you anything. I
[46:16] would tell you right now is if you
[46:18] haven't seen Christ in this message yet
[46:19] and if you haven't seen Christ in the
[46:21] five-fold ministry yet you're missing
[46:22] the whole thing. If the as our brother
[46:25] ministered this morning, if you haven't
[46:27] seen Jesus Christ declared that he is
[46:29] here, then you're missing the whole
[46:30] thing. When you look at your brother and
[46:32] your sister and the confidence that we
[46:34] should have in one another, the the fact
[46:36] that iron sharpeneth iron, the fact that
[46:38] there should be some levity to the
[46:40] wishes and desires of your brothers and
[46:42] sisters is because it should be Christ
[46:44] in them that you're seeing. And if
[46:46] you've discounted that of none effect,
[46:49] you've judged yourself.
[46:51] You should be subject one to another.
[46:54] when when a brother comes to you in the
[46:56] spirit of Christ and submits to you your
[46:59] heir and your folly and I would say this
[47:02] if you haven't achieved the position of
[47:04] doing that you only sit in the sk of the
[47:06] scornful you've identified yourself as
[47:08] not being spiritual
[47:11] are those who spiritual understand the
[47:13] scripture that says ye who are spiritual
[47:16] because you're not spiritual you can't
[47:18] go to those who are an air you've you're
[47:21] just in need of skim milk.
[47:25] That's the seed of the scornful.
[47:28] So if you're so critical that you don't
[47:30] recognize your brother and sister as
[47:32] being a part of the body of Christ, but
[47:34] you can't go to them and restore such a
[47:37] one, then you are not
[47:40] spiritual. This is a math lesson. Sorry,
[47:42] I didn't mean to be critical, but um
[47:46] myself, but just be be mindful. You you
[47:50] don't want to be caught in the seat of
[47:52] the scornful and the seat of the car of
[47:54] critical and not be able to restore such
[47:57] a one.
[47:59] Have confidence that the guide that's in
[48:01] you see once you have discernment it's
[48:03] having the character to know what to do
[48:05] with the discernment. And one place
[48:07] brother Brandham says you love him
[48:08] enough to pray for him but do you love
[48:09] him enough to go to him and tell him
[48:11] something? I was
[48:12] like okay so I can't just leave it at
[48:15] prayer. You mean if I love him enough, I
[48:18] have to be willing to do more than just
[48:20] pray for him. I need to be willing to go
[48:21] to him and say something. Well, that's a
[48:24] burden maybe that you're meant to bear.
[48:26] You need to you need to work through
[48:28] that one until you get in the right
[48:29] spirit and the right atmosphere and be
[48:31] able to go to such a one. There's a
[48:33] labor there. There's a that's a that's a
[48:35] giving of your life and laying it down
[48:37] for the sake of others. You risk your
[48:39] own self to be able to break through and
[48:42] come to the place where you can minister
[48:44] life to somebody else.
[48:46] So it's not that when we recognize that
[48:49] you have no need that man teaches you.
[48:52] It's not that man's doing the teaching.
[48:54] It's
[48:55] Christ the anointed word in your brother
[48:58] and sister in the five-fold ministry and
[49:01] in you. So the the title is confidence
[49:04] in the guide. It's he that is in you is
[49:07] greater than he that is in the world.
[49:17] So when Israel left Egypt for the
[49:19] promised land in Exodus 13:21, God
[49:22] knowed that they had never traveled that
[49:25] way before. It was only 48 miles, yet
[49:28] they needed something to go with them.
[49:31] They'd lose their
[49:33] way. And I would say that there's
[49:35] there's a fear of the unknown.
[49:38] That's one of the things that if you if
[49:40] they would have recognized who was with
[49:42] them, who was leading them, there would
[49:44] have been no murmuring. There would have
[49:46] they would have recognized that they had
[49:48] received the very thing that was to take
[49:50] them over into the promised land. And
[49:52] and though they would face an obstacle,
[49:55] though there would be a dry land, though
[49:57] they would run up against being thirsty
[49:59] and where's the food, they would have
[50:01] had a complete confidence that they'd
[50:02] received the message to take them into
[50:06] the promised land.
[50:08] So you have to recognize the God of your
[50:11] deliverance, the God that brings you out
[50:13] of Egypt is the same God that is going
[50:16] to lead and guide you.
[50:18] It so I there's a deliverance to be made
[50:22] real to you. And I trust that all of in
[50:25] some way recognize the hand of
[50:27] deliverance in your life because I
[50:28] believe that's what David would do when
[50:30] he would face Goliath is is encourage
[50:32] himself in the Lord where the Lord had
[50:35] made himself real to him as the as the
[50:37] God that would defeat the lion and
[50:39] defeat the bear. And you have to know
[50:41] God by experience. This gospel doesn't
[50:43] have another place. You cannot have the
[50:46] faith delivered to you without God
[50:48] making himself real to you personally as
[50:50] an individual.
[50:51] there. This I'm so thankful that is
[50:54] God's provided way and and I and if you
[50:58] haven't received it, the glorious thing
[51:00] is cry cry out for it. Ask God who's
[51:03] faithful and just. If any man lacks
[51:05] wisdom, ask the father. He'll give it to
[51:08] you. But when you have fear of the
[51:11] unknown, it's a fear
[51:14] puralizes. Fear is something that would
[51:16] would would make you ineffective in the
[51:19] body of Christ.
[51:21] So in Matthew chapter 6:25, I feel this
[51:24] is is a great thing. This is coming
[51:26] after he talks about you can't serve
[51:28] mammon and God. Mammon being the cares
[51:30] of the world for the things of the
[51:31] world. It's more than just money. Mammon
[51:33] meaning money. But it also talks about
[51:35] just worldly goods. Anything of this
[51:37] world and its materialism is a is
[51:39] mammon. and and Jesus comes through
[51:43] speaking of mam and how you can't serve
[51:44] two masters that you can't have your
[51:46] heart set upon the affections of the
[51:48] world and and on the things of God
[51:50] because you're going to despise one and
[51:51] serve the other. And then he comes
[51:53] through to something that really should
[51:55] help us recognize how there should be a
[51:57] lack of fear in our lives. This is
[51:59] Matthew 6 verse 25 if you want to put
[52:03] that
[52:05] up. Thank you. Therefore, I say unto
[52:08] you, take no thought for your life, what
[52:11] you shall eat, or what you shall drink,
[52:14] nor yet for your body, what you shall
[52:17] put on. Is not the life more than meat,
[52:20] and the body than raignment. Behold the
[52:23] fowls of the air. For they sow not,
[52:24] neither do they reap, nor gather into
[52:27] barns, yet your heavenly Father feedth
[52:30] them. Are ye not much more than they?
[52:33] Which of you by taking thought can add
[52:35] one cubit unto his stature? I wish that
[52:39] was
[52:42] possible. The leprechaun here would be
[52:45] six inches taller, but you
[52:48] can't. You and that and that's spiritual
[52:51] too. You cannot increase your stature
[52:54] through an intellectual exercise. And
[52:58] why take ye thought for remnant?
[53:00] Consider the liies of the field, how
[53:02] they grow. They toil not, neither do
[53:04] they spin. And yet I say unto you, that
[53:07] even Solomn in all of his glory was not
[53:10] a raid like one of these. Wherefore, if
[53:12] your God so clothe the grass of the
[53:14] field, which is to today is, and
[53:17] tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he
[53:19] not much more than clothe you? Oh ye of
[53:22] little faith. Therefore, take no
[53:25] thought, saying, "What shall we eat, or
[53:28] what shall we drink, or what with all
[53:30] shall we be clothed?" For all these
[53:33] things do the Gentiles seek. For your
[53:35] heavenly Father know that ye have need
[53:38] of all these things. But seek ye first
[53:41] the kingdom of God and his
[53:42] righteousness, and all these things
[53:44] shall be added unto you. Take therefore
[53:47] no thought for the tomorrow, for the
[53:49] tomorrow shall take thought for the
[53:52] things of itself sufficient unto the day
[53:55] is the evil thereof. And we completely
[53:58] got rid of all the career counselors and
[54:00] all the counselors at
[54:02] school and we just did what was that? We
[54:06] just
[54:07] doed a lot of people out of an out of a
[54:11] job by reading this scripture. All the
[54:14] psychologists have been
[54:16] dismissed. The whole fear industry was
[54:19] just obliterated by Jesus Christ. And if
[54:23] you can walk out and you could see the
[54:24] grass, the gospel speaks to you. It's
[54:28] still there and it's still growing
[54:32] and it's going to get watered.
[54:35] And what did it do? Just be who it is.
[54:40] And you are a son and daughter of God.
[54:43] You don't have to fear what man can do
[54:45] unto you. If there's fear, cast it out.
[54:50] He's put a guide inside of you. What
[54:53] does it what's grass do? It just drinks
[54:55] up and it pushes out. Have confidence in
[54:58] the thirst that he's put in you. He's
[55:01] not going to lay any temptation on you
[55:03] more than you can bear. If you're
[55:05] feeling a
[55:06] draw, I got your answer. It's right
[55:09] here.
[55:10] You just go get in there and get fed.
[55:13] You get in there and you drink it up.
[55:15] Put on a tape. But I'll tell you, when
[55:17] you've made a
[55:19] stand, you've served an eviction notice
[55:21] on the devil.
[55:24] So don't be dismayed that when you've
[55:26] done that your part to testify, when
[55:28] you've made a stand, you've done
[55:29] something because you know it's right.
[55:31] You've recognized the goodness of God in
[55:32] your life and you just want to do
[55:34] something. So you do what you know to
[55:37] do.
[55:39] You've swept the house.
[55:42] You've done something to make room.
[55:45] Don't give up in that position. Now you
[55:49] need to claim the promise. Now you need
[55:51] to recognize the what it is that's taken
[55:54] place and do not let yourself be
[55:58] satisfied by a
[56:00] substitute. But you but uh you can have
[56:05] confidence that Christ is the answer. So
[56:09] it's the worldly cares. What is it that
[56:11] why did I tie that here? Because it's
[56:13] the worldly cares that choke out that
[56:16] thirst. It's when you think you need to
[56:18] take a thought for
[56:20] self-preservation. You have no guarantee
[56:22] that you drive the car good enough to
[56:24] get
[56:25] home. Brother Brandham himself said it's
[56:28] the other guy you got to watch out for.
[56:30] You're not controlling that other guy.
[56:33] You have a heavenly father that is
[56:35] looking out after you. You can rest and
[56:38] have a confidence in that. You have to
[56:40] recognize the pattern of
[56:42] it. You have to have a recognition
[56:46] that without him you're
[56:48] nothing. You were nothing when he found
[56:51] you. You're still nothing. And that he's
[56:54] the watchman. He's the guide. So where
[56:57] do we want our attention?
[57:00] We want to be looking to Christ. You
[57:03] know, if you if you're looking to the
[57:04] wrong things, you can't receive the
[57:06] answer. You're
[57:08] distracted. You know, it there's a point
[57:11] where your focus when you seek first the
[57:13] kingdom of heaven, then everything else
[57:15] could be added unto
[57:17] you. So, there's a thing that I would
[57:20] say we have them a local
[57:22] guide. It's somebody who knows the land.
[57:26] If I was uh maybe gonna outback in North
[57:29] America, I would not go hide hire a
[57:32] guide that does safaris and be like,
[57:35] "Hey, man, what mushroom can we
[57:37] eat? We're here. We're in North America
[57:40] and you're a guide. You're a safari
[57:42] guide. I got one of the best guides
[57:44] there are." But he's not a local guide.
[57:46] He's never been this way before. He's
[57:48] not been in the land. We have the
[57:50] benefit of having a church age messenger
[57:53] who stood in this day faced the spirits
[57:56] that you faced and told you how to
[57:58] overcome and how to recognize the devil
[58:00] in every trick. You have a local guide.
[58:03] So what is it what is it that uh it it
[58:06] kind of reminds me uh of a of a tragedy.
[58:09] I forget the exact name of I think
[58:11] there's been some writing on it, but it
[58:12] was a young man who his parents were
[58:15] wealthy and he was a he was in college
[58:18] and he was wellto-do and and I I feel
[58:21] that he came up against every son and
[58:24] daughter of God who recognizes a call
[58:26] for something more in their life. I
[58:28] believe he came to that place of
[58:30] recognizing I'm not just going to take
[58:32] what's given to me. I need to find
[58:33] myself. And in that he he he he to he he
[58:36] he fell out of the relationship with his
[58:38] parents. He told them he didn't want
[58:40] their money. He dropped out of school
[58:42] and he hitchhiked his way to Alaska. And
[58:44] he had a guide
[58:45] book that told them
[58:49] uh what was the edible plants in Alaska
[58:53] and he felt that he could make it by
[58:55] with this guide book. and he set out in
[58:58] the time, I believe, of of of spring.
[59:02] And he made it uh out and he found a a
[59:04] bus that was a bus that was left by some
[59:08] uh from prospectors, some minors, and um
[59:11] he started to live by this guide book,
[59:14] but he wasn't getting enough substance
[59:16] to keep him strong. And he didn't
[59:18] recognize it, but he was getting weaker
[59:20] and weaker. And through this, he turned
[59:23] his heart where he wanted to be back
[59:25] with family. He
[59:28] recognized, if you will, he had a a way
[59:30] be a little word where where he came to
[59:32] himself. He wanted to be he was keeping
[59:34] a journal and he wrote a line something
[59:36] in there like family. And they extracted
[59:39] from that that obviously his mind, his
[59:41] thoughts, he had turned to family. And
[59:43] he went to leave where he was at, but it
[59:47] was fall and the waters had risen. And
[59:51] so the path that he had taken out to
[59:54] isolation, he couldn't go back the same
[59:57] way. The river was too wide and he was
[59:59] too weak to cross it. And he traveled
[1:00:02] back to the bus and he would
[1:00:04] write making his peace with man and just
[1:00:07] different things. And he would write and
[1:00:09] he perished in that bus. And the tragedy
[1:00:11] of it is is if he would have
[1:00:13] known just
[1:00:16] downstream, I think it was within three
[1:00:18] miles, there was a cable wire
[1:00:21] bridge. If there would have been a local
[1:00:24] guide that could have told
[1:00:26] him, his life could have been
[1:00:28] spared. And if you don't recognize that
[1:00:31] this message is your lifeline, and
[1:00:35] you're going to despise what it's
[1:00:36] offering you, you will perish.
[1:00:40] You may think you're making it on your
[1:00:41] own, but you're getting weaker and
[1:00:43] weaker and weaker. And when you need to
[1:00:46] escape, you're going to find out you're
[1:00:48] just too weak. That's true.
[1:00:54] But I I believe he's a present help in a
[1:00:57] time of need. We can take a lesson from
[1:00:59] that. We don't want to be uh stuck
[1:01:02] without. But in recognizing that Christ
[1:01:04] is in our fellow man, that it's Christ
[1:01:06] in you, that we that it's iron that
[1:01:08] sharpenth iron, and then there's a local
[1:01:10] guide. One of the things I thought of is
[1:01:12] that there's a pastor of the home, that
[1:01:14] it's Christ in the mother, that she's
[1:01:17] tutoring the kids, that she's teaching
[1:01:18] them. Brother Brandham said she's a
[1:01:20] pastor of the home. And just to go
[1:01:22] through some scriptures that even would
[1:01:23] say that, it says, "Children, obey your
[1:01:25] parents in the Lord, for it is right.
[1:01:26] Honor your father and your mother, which
[1:01:28] is the first commandment with promise
[1:01:31] that it may be well with you and with
[1:01:33] that you may live long on the
[1:01:36] earth. It says even to honor your
[1:01:39] mother. Happy Mother's Day when she's
[1:01:42] old. This Proverbs 23 is my birthday.
[1:01:45] You know, it's the 23rd 23rd Proverbs.
[1:01:47] There's a lot of things and admonishment
[1:01:48] in there. It tells me to respect my
[1:01:52] mother and to honor my mother and to not
[1:01:55] forget
[1:01:57] her. But that's almost seems
[1:02:00] oldfashioned
[1:02:03] nowadays, you know. Is it is it that
[1:02:06] even that the Jews when they made the
[1:02:08] gospel of none effect, one of the things
[1:02:09] they said they could do is they could
[1:02:11] just give the money and take the parents
[1:02:14] off the you know, here's here's a little
[1:02:16] money. We're even. You raised me and so
[1:02:20] to call it even and this is a gift unto
[1:02:22] God. So you can't ask for it in return.
[1:02:24] So this is a gift of God and you can ask
[1:02:26] of me no more and here's money we're
[1:02:28] even. And they would even divorce their
[1:02:31] hearts from their own parents and not
[1:02:34] even take into account the love of
[1:02:36] Christ that should be in them. There's
[1:02:38] things that we could recog that we could
[1:02:41] if you don't even recognize the Christ
[1:02:43] that birthed you, the Christ that gave
[1:02:45] you your life, and now you think you
[1:02:48] could just go at it
[1:02:50] alone. I That's the That's the
[1:02:53] detriment. That's the substitute is when
[1:02:55] you've come so far, you've come out of
[1:02:57] Egypt, you're
[1:02:58] like, don't have a taskmaster beating my
[1:03:01] back no more. I'm good. And you're just
[1:03:03] going to be a Midianite. You're just
[1:03:06] going to set on the other side of the
[1:03:07] Jordan. You're not going to cross over.
[1:03:09] You're not going to go into full
[1:03:10] possession. We're good enough. The goats
[1:03:12] are happy
[1:03:13] here. The goats can make it. The goats
[1:03:16] can feed. We're good. We're going to
[1:03:18] stay here. There's a there's a detriment
[1:03:21] in setting towards a a settling in not
[1:03:24] taking a full possession.
[1:03:26] And it's because you don't recognize
[1:03:28] that he who's leading you wants to take
[1:03:30] you further. There's a guide that you
[1:03:32] have to be yielded to that you have to
[1:03:34] be willing to follow. You can't be
[1:03:40] complacent. Just going to do a little
[1:03:43] reading here. This is out of the guide.
[1:03:44] What we need is the oldfashioned
[1:03:46] godscent scalding religion that will
[1:03:48] scald the worldliness out of the church.
[1:03:50] I thought we were getting some good good
[1:03:52] that this morning. We need to come back
[1:03:54] to the Holy Ghost and fire. Back to the
[1:03:56] thing that burns out the dross. Back to
[1:03:58] the oldfashioned preaching. Back when
[1:04:01] heaven is high and hell is hot, gun
[1:04:03] barrel straight. We need that kind of
[1:04:05] preaching. But you do it today, your
[1:04:08] congregation will vote you out.
[1:04:11] Sometimes good
[1:04:13] preachers, I got to be careful. You
[1:04:16] don't think our pastor isn't without the
[1:04:20] enemy that when he goes to take a step
[1:04:23] further in Christ and wants to press the
[1:04:25] press further that the devil ain't there
[1:04:27] trying to stand against it. He'll use
[1:04:30] snotty-nosed kids and everything else to
[1:04:32] do it. Sometimes good no good good
[1:04:35] preachers are led astray by the
[1:04:37] congregation. Woo. So I'm glad he just
[1:04:40] doesn't listen to every little opinion
[1:04:43] that comes up that thinks it needs to
[1:04:45] make its way to the
[1:04:48] pastor. And in and this does say
[1:04:51] something. Sometimes good preachers are
[1:04:53] led astray by their congregation. That's
[1:04:56] the reason I have no denomination. I
[1:04:58] have no headquarters. That's from
[1:05:00] heaven. Wherever he sends there I go.
[1:05:02] Whatever he says, I say we don't want no
[1:05:06] denomination. This church ever talk
[1:05:08] about denomination, you've lost your
[1:05:10] pastor right then. I want hang around
[1:05:12] it. No, not five minutes. Well, man, we
[1:05:15] just like to organize stuff. Well, I do
[1:05:18] have news for you. The way we received
[1:05:20] this message, there's one sovereign head
[1:05:22] of the local assembly. That's the
[1:05:23] pastor.
[1:05:25] If you want something else done another
[1:05:27] way,
[1:05:29] you want
[1:05:30] denomination.
[1:05:32] you're
[1:05:33] here. I wouldn't hang around it not even
[1:05:36] five minutes. Every church that ever
[1:05:38] denominated went to the seed and tell
[1:05:41] one that didn't and tell me one ever
[1:05:43] arose and that's Christ in the pastor.
[1:05:45] Just so you know. And if you don't
[1:05:46] believe that, you should
[1:05:49] leave. You ain't doing anybody any
[1:05:52] favors. Sorry. You should stay until you
[1:05:55] get the revelation that that is
[1:05:57] Christ using the shepherd. because he
[1:06:00] would get on to me for saying that.
[1:06:02] Okay, so we're all at different
[1:06:05] places. Please recognize Christ in your
[1:06:09] pastor. He's the one who's ordained to
[1:06:12] see you through. And he would say that
[1:06:14] uh you know, he wouldn't want to take
[1:06:16] that, but God's called him and appointed
[1:06:18] him and given the eyesight and given
[1:06:20] them the vision and and pastors will go
[1:06:23] out on a limb. And I tell you what, they
[1:06:27] can't help it. So I tell if you think
[1:06:30] your pastor's gone astray somewhere, be
[1:06:33] spiritual and get to the lamb that's on
[1:06:34] the limb before they do. So you don't
[1:06:36] have to reproach them for getting all
[1:06:38] brier poked getting some lamb out of a
[1:06:41] bush. We're a large enough body that we
[1:06:44] should be able to go tend to some of
[1:06:45] those things instead of criticizing the
[1:06:47] pastor for going out on a limb.
[1:06:52] Not saying our pastor's guilty of it,
[1:06:54] but a lot of the times the criticism
[1:06:56] isn't the pastor's fault. It's the
[1:06:57] sheep's fault. It's because the people
[1:06:59] who have enough discernment to recognize
[1:07:01] something's wrong don't have enough
[1:07:02] spirituality to go address it.
[1:07:06] Go be your brother's keeper.
[1:07:10] Don't you know who
[1:07:13] wasn't? The Holy Spirit is sent to lead
[1:07:16] the church, not some group of men. The
[1:07:18] Holy Spirit is all wisdom. Men get
[1:07:20] starchy, indifferent. God help our
[1:07:23] indifference. That's all I'm really
[1:07:25] trying to say. God told them that he
[1:07:26] would send them a guide. He would lead
[1:07:29] them in the way. And as long as they
[1:07:31] followed the pillar fire, that was all
[1:07:32] right. He led them up to the promised
[1:07:36] land gate. And then that was as far as
[1:07:39] he was to go. Then Joshua, the great
[1:07:42] warrior, remember the day that told him,
[1:07:44] "Sacrifice yourself the third, sanctify
[1:07:46] yourself the third day. God's going to
[1:07:48] open up the Jordan down here and we're
[1:07:50] going to going to cross. Now, watch what
[1:07:53] he said. I like this in the scripture.
[1:07:55] He said, "Stay close behind the ark for
[1:07:58] you're not you've not passed this way
[1:08:00] before." What was the ark? The word.
[1:08:03] Don't travel your denominational routes
[1:08:05] now. Stay right behind the word because
[1:08:08] you haven't passed this way before. And
[1:08:10] brother, if there is ever a time that
[1:08:13] and this is this is just this morning,
[1:08:16] this quote I feel fits because we should
[1:08:18] recognize the significance. But
[1:08:22] uh wherever a time that the Christian
[1:08:25] church ought to examine itself is right
[1:08:28] now. We're right now where the great
[1:08:29] meeting is going on in Rome right now.
[1:08:32] Differences are being made. the the
[1:08:34] confederation of the churches when all
[1:08:36] the denominations are confederated
[1:08:38] together in the form of the image of the
[1:08:39] beast. Just exactly what the Bible says.
[1:08:41] And you know what he said the morning of
[1:08:43] the message and that was in the morning
[1:08:45] he preached a stature of a perfect man.
[1:08:47] And there here we are right everything
[1:08:50] right at the door and people still
[1:08:52] following after creed. And you better
[1:08:54] stay behind the word. The word will lead
[1:08:56] you across because the word is Christ.
[1:08:58] Christ is God and God is the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:01] Stay behind the word. Oh yes. Stay with
[1:09:04] that guide. Stay right behind it. Don't
[1:09:07] get in front of it. You stay behind it.
[1:09:11] Let it lead you. Don't you lead it. You
[1:09:15] let it go. Joshua said, "Now you've
[1:09:18] never passed this way before. You know
[1:09:20] nothing about the road." That's the
[1:09:22] trouble today. You don't need no guide
[1:09:25] to guide you down the road. Oh, you know
[1:09:28] all the al this this is something the
[1:09:30] way he puts us. Oh, you know all the
[1:09:32] alleys and everything else. You know all
[1:09:35] the ways to
[1:09:37] sin. I mean, I could tell you how to do
[1:09:40] worldly things. I have an intellectual
[1:09:43] carnal understanding because I'm at I'm
[1:09:45] of this world. The things that I have by
[1:09:47] experience. We could tell you how to do
[1:09:50] worldly things. I could I mean, not
[1:09:53] worthy of repeating, but all of you in
[1:09:55] your own ways could probably be like,
[1:09:56] man, this is how you download a movie
[1:09:58] free. Go to this site, do this. Boom,
[1:10:01] boom, boom, boom, boom. This is how you
[1:10:03] can do this. This is how you can do
[1:10:04] that. Right now, there's things of
[1:10:07] carnal, just worldly significance that
[1:10:10] are sinful that every single one of you
[1:10:13] have retained in your
[1:10:14] knowledge. And if you're not, come spend
[1:10:17] time with me. I like your kind of
[1:10:20] company. But every single one of us, you
[1:10:24] know all the ways to sin. Oh, you've
[1:10:26] been around a long time. There's no need
[1:10:28] of somebody trying to tell you about
[1:10:29] that. You know all the shortcuts. That's
[1:10:32] right. Every sin, you know all about it.
[1:10:34] Nobody has to tell you how to steal. You
[1:10:37] know that. Nobody has to tell you how to
[1:10:39] curse. You know that. Nobody has to tell
[1:10:42] you. You know the flip the
[1:10:45] switch. I know how to go home and be a
[1:10:47] good kid. And I know how
[1:10:49] to I'm a new per I'm a new person. I
[1:10:53] know how to do all this stuff. Nobody
[1:10:55] has to tell you how to steal. You know
[1:10:56] that. Nobody has to tell you how to
[1:10:57] curse. You know that. Nobody has to tell
[1:10:59] you how to do these evil things because
[1:11:02] it's posted on every tree
[1:11:05] everywhere. You know, that's quite the
[1:11:06] terminology.
[1:11:09] Posted on every tree everywhere.
[1:11:13] Huh? But remember you people that's
[1:11:16] Christians, you've crossed over. You're
[1:11:18] in another land. You're born again.
[1:11:20] You're in a land, a heavenly land.
[1:11:22] You're in the promised land. You can't
[1:11:24] look. You know your way around here. Oh
[1:11:26] yes, you know what? how to stand in a
[1:11:29] certain hand of cards, you know what the
[1:11:30] dice, you know what rolls, what it
[1:11:32] means, and everything like that. But
[1:11:34] when it comes to holiness and
[1:11:36] righteousness and the power of God and
[1:11:38] how the Holy Spirit operates and what it
[1:11:40] does, you better stay right behind the
[1:11:42] word, the guide, you never passed this
[1:11:45] way before. Well, you say, "I was pretty
[1:11:47] smart, man. I have two degrees."
[1:11:52] And he just goes on down
[1:11:54] just skipping down to 66. But you're
[1:11:58] born again and you've been born into
[1:12:01] holiness. You've not passed this way
[1:12:04] before. You've if you pass this way, you
[1:12:06] have come through holiness because it's
[1:12:08] a new land, a new life, and a new
[1:12:11] people. You come to church, you hear
[1:12:13] somebody raise up, call her. Well, he
[1:12:14] goes he goes and I experienced that once
[1:12:17] in a Menite church. I said, "Amen." I
[1:12:18] couldn't help it. The guy said something
[1:12:20] good, and I got the
[1:12:23] I was like, "Oh, that's what he was
[1:12:25] talking about." Um, but he he goes on
[1:12:29] and says, "Stay behind the word."
[1:12:33] And if you've been born again, that is
[1:12:36] the anointed word in you. That's Christ.
[1:12:40] That's your guide. It has let you know.
[1:12:43] It
[1:12:43] knows the land. It knows the possession
[1:12:47] that you're to have. Just as much as you
[1:12:50] could understand that there's a carnal
[1:12:51] reality and an understanding of someone
[1:12:54] could help you and understand things,
[1:12:55] you've been given the inward teacher
[1:12:57] that is to lead and guide you. It's the
[1:12:59] anointed word faith. You have to have
[1:13:02] confidence in the birth that you've
[1:13:04] received and where it's taken you. It's
[1:13:07] a promised land. It's
[1:13:09] ours. And it it that is that desire that
[1:13:12] down deep in every side of one of you
[1:13:13] that's desiring the supernatural.
[1:13:17] Your carnal being doesn't desire the
[1:13:19] supernatural. The seed of God in you
[1:13:21] desires the supernatural. What we heard
[1:13:23] this morning was even the supernatural
[1:13:25] breaking of the word of God. That's
[1:13:28] supernatural. You desire to be able to
[1:13:31] feed upon the body word of Christ.
[1:13:33] That's supernatural. I'd say that's even
[1:13:35] the one of the more astounding
[1:13:36] supernatural things that we take to
[1:13:38] granted even to what our pastor was
[1:13:39] saying. We become fat. The word of God
[1:13:42] is broken to us supernaturally when we
[1:13:44] gather together. And sometimes we just
[1:13:46] discount what the effect of it should be
[1:13:47] in our lives. It's a transforming word.
[1:13:50] That's to take your very being, your
[1:13:52] very mind. It's to wash it, purify it,
[1:13:54] and bring you in the very image of
[1:13:56] Christ.
[1:13:58] That's the the the long. It's a deep
[1:14:00] call to the deep. It's Christ in you.
[1:14:03] It's supernatural. It it's the faithful
[1:14:05] are the wounds of a friend. When it when
[1:14:08] the word comes in its cutting, that's
[1:14:10] because that's that's Christ in you. Not
[1:14:13] being willing to be complacent,
[1:14:16] but there's change. It's the power of
[1:14:18] the seed to transform it is within the
[1:14:20] seed. So what is the death? What's the
[1:14:22] shedding? What's the shock that it's
[1:14:23] getting rid of? This other false
[1:14:26] identity, the thing that looks that
[1:14:28] could if it was to stay just in the
[1:14:30] religious form could look good enough to
[1:14:33] to look to to play the part, but there's
[1:14:35] a sea gene inside of me that's willing
[1:14:37] to go to the threshing floor, that's
[1:14:39] willing to have the shuck beat off of
[1:14:41] me.
[1:14:43] I'm willing to I'm willing to die that
[1:14:46] the flesh part would die that it would
[1:14:48] shed that it would bear forth Christ the
[1:14:49] seed word that you would see the word in
[1:14:51] its true reality that it would go back
[1:14:53] to the very thing that was intended to
[1:14:55] bear but religion would leave
[1:14:58] you with a lifeless
[1:15:02] seedless
[1:15:04] false epitome
[1:15:06] and I'd say don't settle to satisfy that
[1:15:09] thirst with anything else but a complete
[1:15:11] revelation ation of Jesus Christ and who
[1:15:13] you are. I I have confidence in the
[1:15:16] transforming power of that thirst if
[1:15:18] it's directed properly in the word of
[1:15:20] God that it'll come to fruition. You
[1:15:22] know, there's there's a condemnation
[1:15:23] that's of the devil that leads to
[1:15:25] separation from God. I've said this
[1:15:26] before. You should be able to discern
[1:15:28] something that's trying to separate you
[1:15:30] from the only thing that can help you.
[1:15:32] And if it's the devil, put it under your
[1:15:34] foot. You have no need to accept a
[1:15:36] condemnation that tells you you're not a
[1:15:38] son of God, that you're not bride. If
[1:15:40] it's telling you that you have another
[1:15:42] identity, that's the devil. That's
[1:15:44] right. This word tells you your promised
[1:15:47] land is a son and daughter of God. That
[1:15:49] you're a daughter of God, a son of God,
[1:15:50] and you've been given to possess all
[1:15:52] things. We live in the day of taking a
[1:15:54] body change. We live in a day of being
[1:15:57] able to claim the entire possession
[1:16:00] where my very mind can be completely
[1:16:02] washed so much that I lose my worldly
[1:16:05] identity and I have a complete identity
[1:16:07] in Jesus Christ that don't even think of
[1:16:10] myself as the son of David and Lesie
[1:16:12] McGary that I recognize that I'm a son
[1:16:15] of God that my first account I don't
[1:16:17] have a family allegiance I don't have an
[1:16:20] Irish allegiance I don't have you know
[1:16:23] one of the things that even when I
[1:16:25] recognized don't want here. We're just
[1:16:26] going to go there. But when I realized
[1:16:29] my Irish heritage and what had happened
[1:16:31] and the injustices of time and the
[1:16:34] social justice now I'm 13 years old. I
[1:16:37] don't even know what year that is. 76
[1:16:39] plus 13 for those who want a long time
[1:16:42] ago. I'm in the
[1:16:44] 80s. We read
[1:16:47] newspapers. You might be able to
[1:16:49] subscribe to a news group and get an
[1:16:51] email with something on it. Like you
[1:16:53] guys just don't understand. When you had
[1:16:55] to research things, you had to go to the
[1:16:56] library and get a book. We would go to
[1:16:58] the library and you get rolodex. You
[1:17:00] have the things where you pull out the
[1:17:01] cards and you look at the card number
[1:17:02] and you go, "Okay, this is this and
[1:17:04] this." And I would go get books and I'd
[1:17:05] read about my Irish heritage. And I I
[1:17:10] learned that the Irish were the first
[1:17:12] indentured servants in America and the
[1:17:15] Irish this and the Irish that. And
[1:17:17] buddy, I had my sense of social justice.
[1:17:23] I and and I and just I'll say this to my
[1:17:26] shame, but just so you understand, I was
[1:17:28] willing to go strap a bomb to myself and
[1:17:31] go blow myself up to kill some British
[1:17:33] soldiers and I'm being dead serious and
[1:17:35] I was like, "No one will see me
[1:17:38] coming. I'm off the books." You talk
[1:17:41] about lone wolf, where did the American
[1:17:43] kid come from? Who indoctrinated him?
[1:17:46] Now you look at all the hate that's
[1:17:48] being pumped out there and so readily
[1:17:50] accessible. Saints, you have no idea
[1:17:53] what this world's in for without an
[1:17:56] anchor.
[1:17:57] It she's done. It's full of neurotics.
[1:18:01] And when you and and and you know, you
[1:18:04] think that this thing is going to be
[1:18:06] what you're using in 10 years. You think
[1:18:08] this got your hook in you, you don't if
[1:18:11] you can't withstand this, you can't
[1:18:13] stand what's coming.
[1:18:20] You better get the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:23] You better get a guide. You better not
[1:18:26] get so weak you can't get out.
[1:18:31] God help us.
[1:18:34] Why perish?
[1:18:37] Why perish? There's no excuse. There's
[1:18:42] absolutely no excuse. The son of
[1:18:44] predition has been entirely revealed.
[1:18:46] Every single religious trick of the
[1:18:48] devil. And you want to accept some
[1:18:50] religious barabus, some denominational
[1:18:53] thinking, some self pat on the back.
[1:18:57] That's what when you sell Christ short,
[1:18:59] you've accepted your own denomination.
[1:19:02] That's right. You've accepted a
[1:19:04] denominational barabus.
[1:19:07] It could be a one-man denomination, but
[1:19:09] you know what it says? I'm good
[1:19:11] enough. Right?
[1:19:14] And you've crucified Christ aresh and
[1:19:16] his blood is on your hands.
[1:19:21] Because he's the anointed word. Christ
[1:19:23] is the anointed word. Amen. Sweet. It's
[1:19:26] 6:13. Praise the
[1:19:30] Lord. He would say this. He says, "Jesus
[1:19:34] is on your hands of the people. It's on
[1:19:36] the hands of the church. What will you
[1:19:38] do with this Jesus that's called the
[1:19:40] anointed word? That Christ means the
[1:19:42] anointed word.
[1:19:45] See a murderer. Would you desire a
[1:19:49] denominational murderer of the word than
[1:19:52] the innocent Christ? Would you crucify?
[1:19:56] Would you dare take a Barabus? Could you
[1:19:59] call for Barabbus? How dare anyone do
[1:20:02] that to call for Barabus, the murderer
[1:20:05] of the word?
[1:20:07] Then take the word itself, which is
[1:20:11] life, and it's on your hands. You think
[1:20:15] you could pet a denominational devil
[1:20:18] that keeps people in
[1:20:20] bondage that gives them an
[1:20:23] antirist, a false way of salvation?
[1:20:27] Which one of those denominations
[1:20:29] presents the true liberty of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ? Which one of them tells them
[1:20:34] their names were written on the lamb's
[1:20:35] book of life before the foundation of
[1:20:37] the
[1:20:39] world? Which one of them tells them that
[1:20:42] their identity is in
[1:20:45] Christ? That it's predestinated. You
[1:20:48] were forained to eternal life. That if
[1:20:51] you ever had eternal life, you always
[1:20:52] had it. Predestination is a dirty word.
[1:20:55] You know why? Because it takes makes the
[1:20:57] makes their
[1:20:58] fear-mongering useless.
[1:21:02] you if you recognize the trap that
[1:21:04] somebody's in, you would want to get
[1:21:06] them out of it.
[1:21:09] But you'll call for that. But there's
[1:21:12] people the people who go back to that if
[1:21:14] are the ones who called for Barabouist
[1:21:16] and crucified Christ
[1:21:27] Aresh. Amen.
[1:21:35] So, brother Brandon would tell this
[1:21:36] story and I it's something that I I feel
[1:21:39] that just brings some significance
[1:21:40] because I do feel that the guide that's
[1:21:43] in you
[1:21:45] uh the way that it works is he is is
[1:21:48] through hunger is through thirst. So
[1:21:50] there has to be a way that the guide
[1:21:53] would work. And not only is it through
[1:21:54] correction, not only through is it
[1:21:56] through the word, not o only is it
[1:21:58] through plainless of speech, but because
[1:22:00] it's a heart affair and what he's really
[1:22:03] interested in your character, one of the
[1:22:05] things that he works through is things
[1:22:06] that they start to manifest in our
[1:22:08] spirit and in our emotions. Okay? And so
[1:22:13] you have to recognize when you start to
[1:22:15] become unsettled when there are thing I
[1:22:17] I found this to be very much the case
[1:22:19] when I was a teenager is the thing I I
[1:22:21] don't even know if I finished that story
[1:22:23] but anyways I was poisoned and uh and my
[1:22:27] adolescence on just think of it I had
[1:22:29] more of an identity with my Irish
[1:22:32] heritage. I was plastic Irish. Okay. I I
[1:22:34] I I had Bobby Sand shirts. He's a guy by
[1:22:37] the way died of a hunger strike in the
[1:22:39] Irish prison. Um, I I had more of an
[1:22:42] identity with a culture I'd never even
[1:22:44] been to.
[1:22:47] I have never even been in
[1:22:49] Ireland, but I was I was having an
[1:22:52] identity with that. Um, because what was
[1:22:56] I? I was a son of God wanting an
[1:22:58] identity with a land that I'd never been
[1:23:01] before. So, what was the substitute?
[1:23:04] Right? So there was that what I couldn't
[1:23:07] deny and couldn't manage was that there
[1:23:10] was a cry that had to be satisfied.
[1:23:14] Okay. So what you first and foremost
[1:23:17] have to recognize that anything that
[1:23:19] you're going through in this flesh is
[1:23:22] has a look back to the scripture for the
[1:23:26] scriptural significance of what's taking
[1:23:28] place. Your identity that you should be
[1:23:30] finding is in Christ.
[1:23:33] So, brother Brandham says emotion won't
[1:23:37] do it. You might jump up and down and
[1:23:38] shout as long as you want to or you
[1:23:40] might run up and down the floor. You may
[1:23:41] speak in tongues as much as you want in
[1:23:44] them things and holy and I don't say you
[1:23:46] do nothing like that but until you meet
[1:23:48] the person that satisfying portion that
[1:23:51] something that takes every fiber in your
[1:23:53] body not by emotion but by
[1:23:56] satisfaction used to be a little sign
[1:23:59] said if you're thirsty say
[1:24:02] parfait used to be a little drink when I
[1:24:05] was a boy called parfait I remember
[1:24:07] coming down the road oh from fishing I
[1:24:10] had been up in the pond ond old stagnant
[1:24:12] waters and I'd been starved to death and
[1:24:14] I seen a sign said if you if you're
[1:24:16] thirsty just say parfait I started
[1:24:18] saying parfait parfait
[1:24:22] parfait
[1:24:23] parfait
[1:24:26] parfait if you're thirsty say parfait
[1:24:29] parfait well the world tells you a lot
[1:24:31] of things say
[1:24:33] parfait parfait parfait well it said if
[1:24:37] you're thirsty say
[1:24:39] parfait parfait Hey, this ain't working.
[1:24:42] I'm getting thirsty. But it said,
[1:24:45] but it said if you're thirsty, say
[1:24:47] parfait. If you're thirsty, if you're
[1:24:51] thirsty. If you're thirsty. If you're
[1:24:54] thirsty. If you're thirsty. Parfait.
[1:24:58] Parfait. Parfait. There's a lot of
[1:25:01] things in our life that we're saying
[1:25:03] parfait.
[1:25:05] We're saying it. We're saying it by our
[1:25:08] deeds. We're saying it by our actions.
[1:25:10] And it's a repetitive behavior that we
[1:25:13] think is going to satisfy the thirst
[1:25:17] because I'm doing what they told me was
[1:25:20] going to satisfy my thirst. This is what
[1:25:21] people my age
[1:25:25] do.
[1:25:27] Parfait. But nothing's going to satisfy
[1:25:30] it. But he's saying parfait. I got
[1:25:33] thirstier all the time. I got so I
[1:25:36] couldn't even spit after a while. I was
[1:25:40] so
[1:25:40] thirsty. Well, you see that won't do it.
[1:25:44] There's nothing will satisfy. I don't
[1:25:47] care. You can drink Cokes. You can drink
[1:25:50] any. I got thirsty, by the way, just
[1:25:52] saying all
[1:25:53] that. You can drink all you want to with
[1:25:56] these sweetened bicarbonated waters and
[1:25:58] so forth. There is nothing that will
[1:26:00] satisfy the thirst like a good cold
[1:26:02] stream of water that'll quench the
[1:26:05] thirst. All these other things are
[1:26:07] substitutes. And that's
[1:26:09] why and why would you want to take a
[1:26:13] substitute when there is a genuine
[1:26:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies
[1:26:18] every fiber and longing in the human
[1:26:21] soul. Every satisfy every every every
[1:26:25] longing every longing
[1:26:28] and that is so complete. I have found in
[1:26:32] him everything. His grace is complete.
[1:26:36] Every longing first satisfied in Christ.
[1:26:40] Every longing first satisfied in Christ.
[1:26:44] Every
[1:26:46] longing recognize him as the source and
[1:26:50] the
[1:26:50] satisfier. You do that, he'll add
[1:26:53] everything else unto you and you'll
[1:26:55] recognize it's of him. What fellowship
[1:26:58] is there when you don't even recognize
[1:27:00] the source of it is him? that you that
[1:27:03] even in his goodness because he's good
[1:27:04] to those who despitefully use him. If
[1:27:07] you just obtain things after your own
[1:27:09] will and out of your own
[1:27:12] want and he even allows you to obtain
[1:27:15] those things, but you didn't commit
[1:27:16] those things to him first and say,
[1:27:18] "Lord, I want to be able to to die to
[1:27:21] this that you would have the first
[1:27:24] place." And he says, "Well, that's my
[1:27:26] desire, son. Do what's all in your heart
[1:27:29] to do. you're my son, you're go forward.
[1:27:34] But until you hear that voice, if you
[1:27:36] were like, I just really don't know what
[1:27:38] he wants to say. I I don't know if I do
[1:27:40] want to know because then I wouldn't be
[1:27:44] free to do it. Wrong place. You have to
[1:27:47] be willing to say, Lord, I'm willing.
[1:27:49] This desire I have, this longing I have,
[1:27:51] I recognize it's bigger than me, but I'm
[1:27:53] willing to give it to you.
[1:27:55] I don't want to just at the detriment of
[1:27:58] thinking that by doing this I would not
[1:28:00] be giving you first place. I'm willing
[1:28:02] to give it to you and then he can then
[1:28:05] he could actually bless that
[1:28:08] desire. But you have to be willing to
[1:28:10] surrender it to him. But I I would say
[1:28:13] that recognize when you're saying
[1:28:17] parfait. Did they make a yogurt called
[1:28:21] that? Yep. Oh, thank you. Bad with
[1:28:25] names, name association. But it it's I
[1:28:27] think it's a play on the word. It may be
[1:28:29] French for perfect or something like
[1:28:30] that. But you think that there's a
[1:28:33] perfection in something else. You think
[1:28:35] that it actually has a a satisfying
[1:28:38] portion. It actually is drying you out.
[1:28:41] And and those are that is the substitute
[1:28:43] anytime you do that. And and I would say
[1:28:47] um we're more mature. We don't even let
[1:28:49] emotionalism be the substitute.
[1:28:52] Okay, there's you need emotion. You
[1:28:55] better have emotion. But there's a lot
[1:28:57] of things that be when growth is the
[1:29:00] challenge, you have to recognize what
[1:29:02] God is calling you to grow in. And and
[1:29:04] and what he's calling me to grow in may
[1:29:06] not be that you may need maybe your
[1:29:08] growth is to get emotional, right? But
[1:29:10] if if that's my comfort zone, I
[1:29:12] guarantee you God's going to take me to
[1:29:14] the places like David, you can't just
[1:29:15] satisfy. You cannot stand on sensation
[1:29:18] and emotion alone. You need to be able
[1:29:20] to be rooted and grounded. I'd say this.
[1:29:22] If you're so academic
[1:29:25] that your area of growth may be man, you
[1:29:27] might just need to get a little
[1:29:28] emotional. You need to be able to
[1:29:31] express, you know, I
[1:29:34] was
[1:29:36] I there's a I I heard this guy
[1:29:40] academically describe what a scream was.
[1:29:43] Okay. But there comes a point where
[1:29:45] sometimes there's things that get just
[1:29:47] bottled up into you so much you don't
[1:29:49] know what to do and then they just
[1:29:50] manifest. It's just like I didn't even
[1:29:52] mean for that to happen. It
[1:29:55] just, you know, there's not another way
[1:29:57] to express it. I hope that the emotion
[1:30:00] you have is sometimes bigger than you
[1:30:02] are.
[1:30:03] That if you just have to get alone, I've
[1:30:06] taken my pillow and just put it on my
[1:30:09] head and just say hallelujah because I
[1:30:12] don't want to scare, you know? It's
[1:30:13] like, but I I'm going to explode.
[1:30:17] I hope that you have this this what
[1:30:20] you've received is bigger than you are
[1:30:22] to the point where you just think you're
[1:30:24] just going to blow up. And you don't
[1:30:26] know. You really don't know what's going
[1:30:28] to happen. And you have the liberty to
[1:30:30] say, "Oh Lord, I don't know what's going
[1:30:31] to happen, but you're real. And I just
[1:30:33] want if I have to dance around a tree
[1:30:35] and praise you, I have to sit on the
[1:30:36] pulpit, hike up my and just swing my
[1:30:39] legs."
[1:30:40] And we get so lost in Christ. G. I mean,
[1:30:43] what
[1:30:44] a We're children of God gathered
[1:30:47] together in the in the house of God.
[1:30:49] There should be such a liberty of the
[1:30:50] spirit in us. This is who you are. This
[1:30:53] is who we are.
[1:30:56] There's a song, I'm a Pentecostal. Well,
[1:30:58] I'm a message believer. I've been given
[1:31:00] all things. I've been told who I am by
[1:31:03] promised land. And if anybody's going to
[1:31:05] shout about it, it's going to be me.
[1:31:10] You think you got to dance.
[1:31:13] You think you got a song. We're the
[1:31:15] possessors.
[1:31:17] And I'm not trying to diminish pennies,
[1:31:20] but you better recognize who you are.
[1:31:25] Ain't no bird going to sing in my place.
[1:31:29] Ain't no rock.
[1:31:34] Who are you? Bride. Bride. Bride.
[1:31:41] Hey, you know, we we we should we should
[1:31:43] start services how we end them.
[1:31:47] Our brother Matthew's sitting there
[1:31:49] plowing, plowing, plowing, plowing. We
[1:31:51] should start services coming into the
[1:31:53] house of God's going, "Where's my devil?
[1:31:56] I'm going to pray an atmosphere in
[1:31:57] here." So, somebody just walks in church
[1:31:59] goes, "What's this? What's this? Holy,
[1:32:02] holy, holy, the Lord God Almighty."
[1:32:06] There's a there's all of a sudden the
[1:32:07] awakening of the spirit of Christ where
[1:32:09] it's your refuge. You know why you bow
[1:32:11] your head when you pray? It's a
[1:32:13] declaration.
[1:32:15] I can raise my I can lower my head and
[1:32:18] close my eyes in the presence of a
[1:32:20] allsufficient superior being and know
[1:32:22] all things are committed unto him. I
[1:32:25] don't need to take a thought of anything
[1:32:27] else.
[1:32:29] I can look I God, you have complete
[1:32:31] preeminence right now. Yes, it is nobody
[1:32:34] else but me and you. I'm blocking it all
[1:32:37] out.
[1:32:40] I'm bowing my head. I'm closing my eyes.
[1:32:42] I'm giving you complete preeminence. If
[1:32:45] God can't have the preeminence in the
[1:32:46] sanctuary, how is he going to have
[1:32:48] preeminence somewhere else in your life?
[1:32:50] If you can't recognize this is the place
[1:32:52] to come through before the throne and
[1:32:55] and as saints, not that we make some
[1:32:57] monument out of things, but it's the
[1:32:58] congregation of the saints. It's where
[1:33:01] two or three are gathered in my name.
[1:33:03] I'll be there. When you recognize you're
[1:33:05] fulfilling a commandment, then you can
[1:33:07] recognize yourself as being pleasing to
[1:33:08] him.
[1:33:15] I think I left my book. All right. Well,
[1:33:18] just preach it. All right. So one of the
[1:33:22] things that that you when you when you
[1:33:23] recognize yourself back in the word.
[1:33:26] Okay. So what the message did for you is
[1:33:28] tell you your place and position and
[1:33:30] it's put you back into the word. So what
[1:33:32] Christ did when he would think of fear
[1:33:34] and think I'm sorry but none of us have
[1:33:37] faced the certainty of death like Christ
[1:33:38] did and bore it the way he did in the
[1:33:40] garden of Gethsemane. And the only way
[1:33:42] that he could do that is he recognized
[1:33:44] who he was. So there was a promise word
[1:33:47] concerning them that he would even
[1:33:48] declare to the people, destroy this
[1:33:50] flesh and in three days I'll raise it up
[1:33:51] again. So the only way that he could go
[1:33:54] to where he was going because he had
[1:33:56] never gone that way before.
[1:33:59] Okay? It nevertheless, Lord, let this
[1:34:02] cup pass from me. He's facing the
[1:34:04] scorging. He knows what he's got to
[1:34:06] face. He knows his hour has come and the
[1:34:10] only thing that he could take a position
[1:34:13] in is what the word told him he would
[1:34:15] be. That's the only thing he could do is
[1:34:18] see it was beyond it at that point. He
[1:34:20] went to the cross of man. He didn't go
[1:34:22] in the power of the anointing. He didn't
[1:34:24] go with the with the mighty power of
[1:34:26] God. And what do you think you've been
[1:34:28] called to? I thank God for the
[1:34:30] anointing. But you know what? You better
[1:34:32] have a great You face the valley of
[1:34:34] decision and you face death. You better
[1:34:36] know where you stand. It's not going to
[1:34:38] be something that you could just rest. I
[1:34:40] feel it.
[1:34:42] And I love to feel it. I would be the
[1:34:44] fanatic running all over here if that's
[1:34:46] all we did. If that's all that we had
[1:34:48] and all was the promises, buddy. Just
[1:34:49] get through into the presence, buddy. I
[1:34:51] would just be a dancer. Amen.
[1:34:58] Oh, I want to say I want to say
[1:34:59] ballerinas for Christ. But
[1:35:02] it's about You wouldn't believe the
[1:35:04] nonsense that's out there.
[1:35:08] They got people doing hula hoops. They
[1:35:10] got hula hoop teams.
[1:35:13] They done lost their mind. But that's
[1:35:15] what the anointing without the word will
[1:35:17] do.
[1:35:19] and and there's anointing, but they have
[1:35:21] no word foundation.
[1:35:23] So, you have to recognize what you've
[1:35:25] been called to is to stand upon the
[1:35:27] word, but you better know what the word
[1:35:28] says you are and what your place is. You
[1:35:30] better recognize that you've been placed
[1:35:32] back in the word. Yes, sir. Okay.
[1:35:35] So, there's nothing else that they had
[1:35:38] to take a Joshua
[1:35:40] message. You've received a message that
[1:35:44] has told you what your position is.
[1:35:46] Amen. It told you. It It was the
[1:35:49] declaring when the seals were open. It
[1:35:51] read your name.
[1:35:54] It read your name and told you who you
[1:35:56] are. It is because you've received the
[1:35:59] word that you could recognize who you
[1:36:01] are. It is the you know, people hate
[1:36:04] that. You know, it's like it's it's a
[1:36:06] self-indicating message. They hate the
[1:36:08] fact that what we say is that well, you
[1:36:10] recognize who you are because well,
[1:36:12] isn't that easy and convenient? It's
[1:36:13] what you believe is the truth. So that
[1:36:15] makes you right.
[1:36:17] Hate it. But that's what faith is.
[1:36:22] Faith that it declares on what evidence
[1:36:25] because he said so. He's the one who
[1:36:27] said it. He's the one who said that was
[1:36:29] the evidence of it. I didn't say it. If
[1:36:32] he would have given it evidence or did
[1:36:33] it in a certain way, we'd all be doing
[1:36:35] it.
[1:36:37] I'm so thankful that this message didn't
[1:36:39] come with in such a way. You know, some
[1:36:42] were baptized into this, some were
[1:36:43] baptiz I thank God I didn't baptize any
[1:36:44] of you. If the message would have come
[1:36:46] in such a way where brother Brandham
[1:36:48] received it, we I guess we could all go
[1:36:49] to a a coal
[1:36:51] cabin. But you would want to receive the
[1:36:53] Holy Ghost the exact same way the way
[1:36:55] Brother Brandham received it if it was
[1:36:57] left to an academic formula or something
[1:36:59] you could put your finger
[1:37:01] on because that's what religion does.
[1:37:04] Religion wants you to be able to satisfy
[1:37:06] yourself with some something academic.
[1:37:09] And it really doesn't matter what it is.
[1:37:12] It could even be receiving. You know, I
[1:37:14] recognize the word for the day. I'm
[1:37:17] Amen. It is. So, whatever it is, the
[1:37:20] heart is a deceitful thing. You better
[1:37:23] recognize that it's Christ in you. It
[1:37:26] better not even it. Sure, there's a
[1:37:28] mental faculty that recognizes it, but
[1:37:31] honestly, we should be so far beyond our
[1:37:33] minds that is simply Christ living out
[1:37:35] the word in us. And it's the word that
[1:37:38] takes preeminence. And you have to
[1:37:40] recognize your place in the word.
[1:37:43] So where is your position of authority
[1:37:45] once you're in the word? You want to
[1:37:47] talk about how we began the service
[1:37:49] about you're so lost in Christ. Now if
[1:37:51] I'm if I'm word destroy me.
[1:37:58] I'm the word of God. What are you going
[1:38:01] to do unto me? Some of us better get the
[1:38:04] recognition you are the word of God
[1:38:06] because everything else will be
[1:38:07] destroyed. Where do you want to be
[1:38:09] found?
[1:38:11] In the word.
[1:38:13] Where how are you going to find
[1:38:15] what? Well, I find it in Roblox. Now,
[1:38:19] yeah, whatever the entertainment is.
[1:38:22] I took that as an easy one. Just nothing
[1:38:24] wrong with it. I played it myself. But
[1:38:27] you're not going to learn who you
[1:38:29] are by
[1:38:32] indulging the things of the world.
[1:38:35] You're going to find who you are by the
[1:38:37] message that has placed you in your
[1:38:39] promised land. You're going to find it
[1:38:41] by the Joshua message, by the Moses
[1:38:43] message. That is the message of this day
[1:38:45] that it's the Malachi 4:5. It's the
[1:38:47] Revelations 10:7. It's the revealing of
[1:38:50] the son of man. Because in revealing the
[1:38:52] son of man, he declared that you were in
[1:38:54] him. Amen. He declared that you were in
[1:38:56] Christ at Calvary. I This message is so
[1:38:59] beautiful. I, you know, as I mentioned
[1:39:03] earlier, you just don't understand the
[1:39:05] paralyzation of partial truths.
[1:39:09] Men in good
[1:39:10] intent. They did all the all they could,
[1:39:13] but they were left without a complete
[1:39:15] power because they
[1:39:17] had an impartial truth. When you want to
[1:39:20] recognize that which is perfect has
[1:39:22] come, we've received a perfect word that
[1:39:23] delivers a perfect faith.
[1:39:34] And when Jesus himself said, "The prayer
[1:39:36] of faith shall save the sick, they shall
[1:39:39] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:39:40] recover." You must have the same perfect
[1:39:42] confidence. When hands is laid on me, I
[1:39:46] shall recover. He said so. He said, "You
[1:39:48] destroy this body and I'll raise it up
[1:39:50] because you know what the Messiah I'll
[1:39:52] not suffer my holy one to see
[1:39:54] corruption." He knowed he I thought I
[1:39:56] lost this. He was the holy one. Neither
[1:39:58] will I leave his soul in hell. He
[1:40:00] didn't. He knowed he'd do it. He had
[1:40:03] confidence in that he was there to
[1:40:05] conquer both death and hell and said,
[1:40:07] "Destroy it if you wish to. I'll raise
[1:40:10] it back up again in three days." Oh my.
[1:40:12] I have power to lay down my life. I have
[1:40:14] power to take it up again. He knowed who
[1:40:15] he was. You're a Christian. You have a
[1:40:18] right to any redemptive blessing that
[1:40:21] Jesus died for you. It's all yours. It's
[1:40:24] already paid for. You just have to
[1:40:26] believe it. Not imagine it, but believe
[1:40:29] it and know that it's yours and you can
[1:40:31] possess it. Oh, that's conquering faith.
[1:40:34] You know,
[1:40:36] now down this is this is uh down. I'm
[1:40:40] going to go down to
[1:40:42] 148. Actually, I'll just read through.
[1:40:44] It's just 147. He knew it was happened
[1:40:46] before he could predict. This is
[1:40:48] important because you you have to
[1:40:50] understand the book is a prophet. The
[1:40:52] Bible is a prophetic book. We believe in
[1:40:54] the power of prophecy.
[1:40:56] Okay? Prophecy is when the word is
[1:40:59] spoken and there's no
[1:41:02] evidence a virgin shall conceive. It's a
[1:41:06] prophecy and everything
[1:41:10] says can't happen.
[1:41:14] So you have to recognize that this
[1:41:16] message has prophesied a
[1:41:19] bride to be here and to the raptures on
[1:41:23] to take a body change. It's
[1:41:25] prophecy as soon as it was spoken.
[1:41:31] The devil couldn't stop it.
[1:41:35] So he knew. So this is Christ now. He
[1:41:40] hasn't yet been crucified.
[1:41:43] So he is
[1:41:45] resting on what the word has
[1:41:49] prophesied and he knew it would happen
[1:41:52] but he could predict that it would
[1:41:54] happen because he knowed it would happen
[1:41:56] and whatever he predicted come to pass.
[1:41:58] Now watch whatever he said God honored
[1:42:00] what he said. Think of that. Whatever
[1:42:02] Jesus said God brought it to pass. So he
[1:42:04] knowed his words were God's words. Now
[1:42:07] look, that same scripture comes back
[1:42:10] into us again.
[1:42:14] If ye say to this mountain, "Oh my, I
[1:42:17] just let this soak in just a little."
[1:42:18] You see, cuz we're going to have a
[1:42:20] prayer line. We dismiss the congregation
[1:42:22] to pray for the
[1:42:24] sick. I mean, it's
[1:42:28] voluntary. He He dismissed the
[1:42:30] congregation to pray for the sick. So
[1:42:32] those who need to go, you can go. It's
[1:42:34] voluntary. pray for the sick and the
[1:42:36] ones that want to has to go. Look, he
[1:42:39] knew that he that he pleased God. And
[1:42:43] that this is there's power in this.
[1:42:45] Look, he knew that he pleased God. I
[1:42:50] want you to recognize your faith pleases
[1:42:55] God. Your faith pleases
[1:42:58] God. If there is a lie hanging over your
[1:43:02] life, let's see.
[1:43:05] I I do think that's a it's a tragic sign
[1:43:08] of the times actually. Most of those
[1:43:09] things are Amber alerts and it seems
[1:43:11] like they happen every time all the
[1:43:13] time. There's there's uh children that
[1:43:15] in circumstances out there and uh you
[1:43:19] get just I I keep mine on just because I
[1:43:21] keep those things in prayer and I've
[1:43:23] seen God answer prayer. There's a recent
[1:43:24] testimony of a family in South Africa
[1:43:26] that they had disappeared. They put out
[1:43:28] alert saints went to prayer and they
[1:43:30] were all found safe. And so I I don't
[1:43:32] think we should lose our burden to those
[1:43:34] things. Look, he knew that he pleased
[1:43:39] God.
[1:43:41] Saints, you must recognize your life,
[1:43:46] especially in sufferings. That's why you
[1:43:48] can't let the devil rob you of your joy.
[1:43:52] Your life pleases God. Hallelujah.
[1:43:56] What was it that he it when he even
[1:43:58] testifies of Christ, it pleased him
[1:44:03] for to put Christ through
[1:44:07] suffering. So the devil even
[1:44:11] when when brother Brandon would sit
[1:44:14] there and he's sitting there at the
[1:44:16] place to with his own child, he he said
[1:44:19] he didn't love you. You have to
[1:44:22] recognize that the love that Christ that
[1:44:24] God had for you was already declared at
[1:44:27] Calvary. For you to
[1:44:29] deny that you're the purchased
[1:44:32] possession, why did he purchase you? Why
[1:44:35] would he go to Calvary? We should be so
[1:44:38] past this point. But the devil tries to
[1:44:41] make you and condemn you so you don't
[1:44:42] have confidence to God.
[1:44:49] So if we would
[1:44:52] recognize you were worth dying
[1:44:55] for, he did that because he's pleased by
[1:44:59] you. He loves you. You can do no wrong
[1:45:03] in his
[1:45:06] sight. You're his child.
[1:45:09] on Mother's Day, they could probably
[1:45:11] tell you, you talk about a mama
[1:45:15] bear, you don't understand the motherly
[1:45:18] attribute that God has for you. You
[1:45:22] can't do
[1:45:26] wrong. You please God. And it should be
[1:45:29] the love of God that drives you to
[1:45:31] repentance. If you recognize that he's
[1:45:33] identifying himself with you and that he
[1:45:35] loves you and you're not living up to
[1:45:36] it, that should be enough in you to
[1:45:37] cause a change. But he's still pleased
[1:45:40] with you as a
[1:45:44] son. He just recognizes a whole lot more
[1:45:47] potential in you than you recognize in
[1:45:50] yourself. Look, he knew that he pleased
[1:45:52] God. Please take that home with you. If
[1:45:54] you don't do take anything else home
[1:45:56] with you, it's your position in Christ
[1:45:58] is that he loves you and that you're the
[1:46:01] apple of his eye. He knew that he was
[1:46:04] nothing on his life. He knew that he had
[1:46:07] nothing on his life. God had already
[1:46:09] testified, "This is my beloved son in
[1:46:11] whom I'm well pleased. Hear him." This
[1:46:14] is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:46:16] dwell in. In the day of his baptism, I'm
[1:46:19] pleased to make my abode in here.
[1:46:21] There's no condemnation to him at all.
[1:46:25] The seed of God remainth in you. If
[1:46:27] you've been born of God, if you have the
[1:46:29] Holy Ghost, blameless. Now, when the
[1:46:31] same God comes to you and it's pleased
[1:46:34] to dwell in you, pleased to honor your
[1:46:37] word, what your decision is, still a
[1:46:41] decision. What was Joshua's decision?
[1:46:45] Stand still, son. And it stood there.
[1:46:48] Amen. Sure.
[1:47:03] come to pass you will have what he said
[1:47:05] that puts you back in the word.
[1:47:09] That's your position. That puts you back
[1:47:11] in the word. Now that's not skim milk.
[1:47:15] It puts you back. I know it's going to
[1:47:17] jump right over you. maybe see because
[1:47:19] it can't anchor, but real genuine faith
[1:47:22] catches that right now. I've seen it,
[1:47:24] friend. Here's the Bible laying out
[1:47:26] before me. He goes in and he talks about
[1:47:29] how he he spoke the scrolls into
[1:47:31] existence, but you take God at his word,
[1:47:40] and that's your
[1:47:41] place. It's your faith that looks to the
[1:47:44] finished work at Calvary. It's the faith
[1:47:45] that recognizes your place in the word.
[1:47:47] and you uh you don't have a position
[1:47:50] outside of it. It's really not
[1:47:53] optional. Heavens and earth will pass
[1:47:55] away, but the word will not pass away.
[1:47:58] Your only position is Christ in the
[1:48:00] word. You have no other place. That's
[1:48:03] why you could have a boldness and a
[1:48:04] confidence in who you are as a son of
[1:48:06] God because I'm in the word. My
[1:48:09] position's in the word. Fortify yourself
[1:48:13] in the word.
[1:48:15] And it's that it really is that simple.
[1:48:17] But you better recognize that you have
[1:48:19] been placed in the word by the word for
[1:48:21] your day. It's the it's the local
[1:48:24] guide. We haven't positioned ourselves
[1:48:26] in a false salvation for another day. We
[1:48:29] aren't resting in a partial truth. We're
[1:48:32] not resting in something that is less
[1:48:34] than perfect. We've received a perfect
[1:48:36] word that completely declares us who we
[1:48:40] are and our position in Christ. If the
[1:48:41] musicians could come
[1:48:49] It puts us back into our rightful
[1:48:52] inheritance. It puts us back to where we
[1:48:55] are. The
[1:48:57] guide places you if you were
[1:49:00] hunting, the guide is to put you into
[1:49:03] the position to take the
[1:49:05] shot. His whole thing is to give you the
[1:49:10] opportunity to land the fish. He's going
[1:49:13] to put you in the right spot,
[1:49:16] but he doesn't shoot it for you.
[1:49:19] He doesn't land the fish for you.
[1:49:22] Otherwise, you'd be a spectator. But
[1:49:24] what a guy does is he puts you in the
[1:49:26] position that you need to be in. And
[1:49:29] then he
[1:49:32] says, "Speak the word.
[1:49:37] Speak the word.
[1:49:40] Shoot.
[1:49:42] I put it in your hands.
[1:49:44] It's right here. Right like I told you
[1:49:47] it would be.
[1:49:49] You're on target. We're right in the
[1:49:52] hour that this message said we would be
[1:49:55] in.
[1:49:56] What's the target?
[1:49:59] Perfection.
[1:50:01] Rapture. Speak the word.
[1:50:05] Salvation of my family. Speak the word.
[1:50:08] Healing of my body. Speak the word.
[1:50:12] What have I received in this day? A
[1:50:14] confidence in who I am. A confidence in
[1:50:17] who he is. A confidence of my position
[1:50:19] in Christ
[1:50:24] Jesus. I don't have a song written down
[1:50:27] this time, so you could play
[1:50:28] whatever. Believe it'll be the right
[1:50:31] song. Let's just rejoice in the Lord,
[1:50:34] saints, for what he's done for
[1:50:36] us. He's told he's told us who we are.
[1:50:40] and that the land is
[1:50:42] ours. And I'm so thankful for the word
[1:50:44] we received, thankful for the the
[1:50:46] message this
[1:50:48] morning. Let's just go to him in prayer
[1:50:50] as we turn the service over. Gracious
[1:50:52] heavenly father, we're so thankful that
[1:50:54] you've made us an heir of all things.
[1:50:56] And Lord, that the victory is ours
[1:50:58] because you've already finished the
[1:51:00] work. And Lord, we could just confide in
[1:51:03] you as the guide that when your wings
[1:51:07] are wrapped around us, Father, we have a
[1:51:08] confidence in who we are. And all the
[1:51:10] fear is gone, Father, because we know
[1:51:13] who we're with and who's abiding in us.
[1:51:15] And Lord, we ask that any fear, any
[1:51:18] doubt, any hindrance, Lord, that you
[1:51:21] just cast it away. For you said you're
[1:51:22] the father of lights in whom there's no
[1:51:24] variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[1:51:27] Lord, that you're the giver of every
[1:51:28] good gift. and Lord that we could ask of
[1:51:30] you and receive. And Lord, we want to
[1:51:32] ask that our joy would be full. We want
[1:51:34] to ask for wisdom. We want to ask for
[1:51:36] revelation. We want to ask, Lord, what
[1:51:38] is our day, the hour we've been placed
[1:51:40] in? What is it that you would have us to
[1:51:42] do? And Lord, may we have a boldness to
[1:51:45] recognize our day in its message, Lord?
[1:51:47] That now's the time for us to speak,
[1:51:49] that it's the salvation for our friends
[1:51:50] and for our family, Lord. That you put
[1:51:53] the very words of life upon our lips
[1:51:55] that we could sound out this gospel
[1:51:57] truth. And Lord, we ask that Lord, as
[1:51:59] the needs that have been gathered and
[1:52:01] Lord, what what a privilege it is to
[1:52:03] gather with saints of precious like
[1:52:05] faith. And Lord, ones that have pressed
[1:52:07] the battle and represent a victory just
[1:52:09] being in the house of God. And Lord, I
[1:52:11] ask that you would bless them, Lord.
[1:52:12] It's it's an encouragement to see those
[1:52:15] that are putting you first. And Father,
[1:52:17] I ask that the needs that are present,
[1:52:19] Lord, and that each one now would just
[1:52:22] lift those up before you, Father, and
[1:52:24] ask, Lord, that you would be glorified.
[1:52:26] that it's not of man that these things
[1:52:28] have been done, Lord, but it's that our
[1:52:29] heavenly father would be glorified.
[1:52:31] Lord, we're looking for you to be the
[1:52:33] one who brings a consummation, Lord.
[1:52:36] Brings a the answer, Lord. We're we're
[1:52:38] trusting in the supernatural, Lord, by
[1:52:41] revelation that we could see it,
[1:52:42] proclaim it, and believe it, Lord, and
[1:52:44] that our faith would be pleasing to you.
[1:52:46] Just commit the these words to you that
[1:52:48] you would grant the increase. We thank
[1:52:50] you, Father, in the mighty name of our
[1:52:52] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:52:54] Amen. If you can help me sing
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:53:02] this
[1:53:04] my word
[1:53:08] prof.
[1:53:13] Amen. Oh my God so much bigger
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:21] than Hallelujah.
[1:53:26] Oh, why would I hunger for power or
[1:53:31] riches or
[1:53:35] fame?
[1:53:37] Oh, cuz my God so much
[1:53:42] better all of these things.
[1:53:48] So I won't be
[1:53:53] shen and I love
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:58] you. For my God is
[1:54:04] faithful. His promise is
[1:54:08] true. I'm going to speak. So I'll speak
[1:54:12] to the
[1:54:14] mountain. Oh, it's time to move. It's
[1:54:18] time to move.
[1:54:22] Greater is he that's in you. My God is
[1:54:25] bigger, better,
[1:54:28] stronger, greater than you.
[1:54:32] My enemies
[1:54:35] scatter. My enemies scatter. Cuz they
[1:54:39] know the battle is
[1:54:43] done. Hallelujah.
[1:54:47] My God is stronger. The
[1:54:51] victory already.
[1:54:54] Oh, thank you for
[1:54:56] Calvary. Oh, he died my ransom and rose
[1:55:03] up on the third
[1:55:07] day. Yes.
[1:55:11] My God, the savior, the dead, hell, and
[1:55:16] the
[1:55:19] grave. Oh, so I won't be
[1:55:23] shen.
[1:55:25] Declare, well, I won't be
[1:55:29] moved. Heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:55:31] but the word that's in you cannot pass
[1:55:35] away. Oh, his promises.
[1:55:39] He spoke goodness to you. I would that
[1:55:41] you would be a sound mind and well body.
[1:55:44] So I'm speak to the man.
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:59] better,
[1:56:01] stronger, greater. Let's sing that
[1:56:04] second verse
[1:56:06] again. Aren't you glad your enemies are
[1:56:08] running? My
[1:56:11] enemies, but I know the battle is
[1:56:20] now. My God is stronger. The victory is
[1:56:26] already
[1:56:30] done.
[1:56:32] Oh
[1:56:34] my
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:42] god. Oh, and my God is greater
[1:56:48] than heaven with great
[1:56:54] I won't be
[1:56:58] s for
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:04] I for my God is
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:10] faithful. His promises is true.
[1:57:16] Oh, let us see
[1:57:21] you. Oh, and it's time to
[1:57:27] move. Oh, my God is
[1:57:31] bigger, better,
[1:57:34] stronger, greater.
[1:57:37] Sing that third
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:42] verse. There's no mountain to hide, no
[1:57:47] valley to know. There's no fear that I
[1:57:51] have that is
[1:57:53] already. There's no problem to me.
[1:57:57] There's no weapon to there is
[1:58:02] nothing that's impossible.
[1:58:06] Oh, there's no mountain to find, no to.
[1:58:12] There's no free that I have,
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:17] but there's no problem to me. There's
[1:58:23] no there is nothing for God. That's
[1:58:27] impossible.
[1:58:31] Oh, I won't be
[1:58:37] sh I won't be
[1:58:41] good. Oh, my God is
[1:58:47] faithful. Lord, his promises is true.
[1:58:55] Oh, I see to the mountain.
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:08] [Applause]
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:18] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:59:20] Lord.
[1:59:23] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad you serve a
[1:59:25] big God? The God who knows the beginning
[1:59:29] before the end. He knows it. Even before
[1:59:32] the end comes, he's already knows about
[1:59:34] everything. I mean, if you really think
[1:59:36] about this, this is really insane. All
[1:59:38] of this was already planned. The battle
[1:59:41] was already won. And we're just here
[1:59:43] playing the part.
[1:59:45] I mean, how can you fail in just playing
[1:59:47] the part,
[1:59:50] you know, but yet it drops confusions
[1:59:53] and drops this and he makes the battle
[1:59:55] looks so real. It's not real. He already
[2:00:00] lost. You can't fail for that. Don't
[2:00:03] give into it. He He was already, the
[2:00:07] scripture says, even before the
[2:00:09] foundation of the world. You know, I
[2:00:11] don't so like that because the the
[2:00:13] purpose for the thirst is so that
[2:00:15] something can come and answer it. The
[2:00:18] there's this manifestation just like
[2:00:20] Alberta said in the natural, you know,
[2:00:22] you have thirst for water, you hungry,
[2:00:24] you this all of that is God positioning
[2:00:27] himself in your life naturally so you
[2:00:31] can go and eat the natural food so you
[2:00:33] can survive spiritually so you can call
[2:00:36] out for him for him to come and answer.
[2:00:39] But if you refuse to come to the
[2:00:42] spiritual person who can satisfy the
[2:00:44] thirst, you're going to
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:47] die. So he's wanting us to all he's
[2:00:50] wanting us is just to come to him and
[2:00:52] say, "Father, I'm thirsting for the Holy
[2:00:54] Spirit. Father, I'm thirsting for the
[2:00:57] life, the perfect life. I'm thirsting
[2:00:59] for that perfection in me." And he's
[2:01:01] looking and say, "Yep, I already
[2:01:02] answered all of that."
[2:01:05] You know the word when said this I I
[2:01:08] believe it was brother Matthew you said
[2:01:09] it that it says it's to answer for the
[2:01:12] need of the hour. Whatever the need of
[2:01:15] the hour is the word is packaged to have
[2:01:19] all of those answers in it. It's not
[2:01:21] packaged for you to eat it and say well
[2:01:24] I got to figure out where is that other
[2:01:26] movement that I can go to so I can add
[2:01:28] to it. No. Once you receive the word you
[2:01:30] receive the full package.
[2:01:34] And once you receive it, you are good to
[2:01:36] go. It It's for the journey, for the
[2:01:39] entire journey.
[2:01:42] But we take the thirst and we try to
[2:01:44] fill it up with other things and we try
[2:01:46] to do all of that. It won't work. It
[2:01:47] won't satisfy.
[2:01:50] And I'll just say this for myself. I I
[2:01:52] feel like, you know, sometimes we have
[2:01:54] this heaviness upon us, you know, and I
[2:01:57] just don't know where it comes from. If
[2:01:59] you look at the rapid unveiling of the
[2:02:02] scriptures and the prophecies that were
[2:02:04] given, you would think the church will
[2:02:06] be full.
[2:02:09] You think the altars will be full.
[2:02:11] People will be searching within the
[2:02:12] heart. Oh God, let not me. I don't want
[2:02:14] to miss it. I want to be ready. I want
[2:02:16] to do that. Where is that that just that
[2:02:19] that heart desire to hunger or or the
[2:02:22] urgency of knowing that the hour is
[2:02:24] closing every day, every moment?
[2:02:30] Amen. I believe he's faithful, but I I
[2:02:33] believe with all my heart, we just need
[2:02:34] to seek that which has placed. He's not
[2:02:37] asking for you to look for something you
[2:02:39] don't have. He's asking for you to take
[2:02:42] what he's given you and feed it through
[2:02:44] the word of God and feed that hunger
[2:02:46] with the word of God with with the
[2:02:48] positioning is so that you can have
[2:02:50] confidence confidence in God. Like our
[2:02:53] brother said, I know I'm right with God.
[2:02:56] I know what he's promised me, he will
[2:02:58] come to bring it to pass. I know if I
[2:03:00] speak, he will hear me. He wants to
[2:03:02] reestablish that relationship that was
[2:03:05] lost so we can have peace within our
[2:03:07] heart. You don't want to be praying not
[2:03:09] knowing if your prayers can be answered
[2:03:11] or not. That's a terrible situation to
[2:03:14] be
[2:03:14] in. But the way the way the reason why
[2:03:17] we come is oh Lord, we purge our heart.
[2:03:20] We remove the leaven. We remove all the
[2:03:22] things. And we know that when I'm in
[2:03:24] peace with God, it don't matter. Then
[2:03:26] you can sing the song and say, "My God
[2:03:28] is bigger, better, stronger." Then you
[2:03:31] can be like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed
[2:03:33] say, "Even if it doesn't do right now, I
[2:03:36] still believe he's with me."
[2:03:39] That's the place where we want to be.
[2:03:40] That's maturity right there. It's not
[2:03:43] one day God is with me, another day he's
[2:03:45] abandoned me. No, he's not that kind of
[2:03:47] God. He said, "I'll be with you, even in
[2:03:49] you until the end." He's ne if he's
[2:03:52] never fail. If you don't have an example
[2:03:55] where he failed, you would never have
[2:03:57] one in the future because he's the same
[2:03:59] yesterday, today, and forever. He's the
[2:04:02] same all the time.
[2:04:05] And that's the kind of God we serve. He
[2:04:08] wants us to have confidence.
[2:04:10] Confidence with him to know that he will
[2:04:13] lead us. He will be the guide. Uh when
[2:04:15] you come to the guide, I love what you
[2:04:17] said. He said he's going to show you the
[2:04:19] shot. He said, "You know what? If you
[2:04:21] stand here, if you take this position,
[2:04:24] you'll have the best view possible. Oh,
[2:04:26] you know, you will come and you're
[2:04:27] trying to see. He's like, "Oh, no, no,
[2:04:29] you guys follow me. Come and stand up on
[2:04:31] this rock. You'll have the best view of
[2:04:33] the environment and you can look there
[2:04:35] and see everything." Why? Because he's
[2:04:37] been there before.
[2:04:40] We have the perfect message. We have the
[2:04:44] word that all throughout the ages had
[2:04:47] longed to be in this age. The prophet
[2:04:50] packet said that God took all of that.
[2:04:53] He said in the end time he didn't reveal
[2:04:55] a portion. He revealed it in the
[2:04:57] entirety to the program of God. What he
[2:05:00] wanted to do since the beginning.
[2:05:03] He revealed it to us. And how can we
[2:05:06] fail with the word in our hands?
[2:05:07] Absolutely impossible.
[2:05:10] It can't
[2:05:12] happen.
[2:05:13] Amen. Oh, the Lord the Lord is
[2:05:16] wonderful. Amen. Why don't we sing that
[2:05:19] song? God is good. Amen. All the time.
[2:05:23] Amen. Oh, if you're
[2:05:26] walking all through the
[2:05:29] valley and the shadows all
[2:05:35] around. Oh, and do not
[2:05:38] fear. Oh, and he will guide
[2:05:42] you. He will give you
[2:05:48] Oh my
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:06:01] god is
[2:06:04] good. All is
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:11] God.
[2:06:13] My God is good.
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:17] All the
[2:06:19] time to the darkness.
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:35] Oh, we were
[2:06:38] just
[2:06:41] [Music]
[2:06:45] crossing the forest.
[2:06:49] [Music]
[2:07:04] Oh
[2:07:06] my
