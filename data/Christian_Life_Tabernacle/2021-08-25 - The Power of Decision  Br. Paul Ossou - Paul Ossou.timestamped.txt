[39:45] gracious father
[39:48] you're so wonderful to us lord
[39:52] so many times we
[39:54] fail to thank you
[39:57] father we don't even realize how much
[39:59] that you really do for us
[40:02] our brother how you protected him today
[40:06] lord how many times did that happen
[40:09] day in and day out
[40:12] you're so good this
[40:14] we like to thank you for all the things
[40:16] that we miss lord
[40:19] [Music]
[40:20] thank you for your loving care for us
[40:22] that's endured all these years
[40:26] you ask you to bless us and help us
[40:29] less brother paul this evening as he
[40:31] brings the word
[40:32] in jesus wonderful name we pray
[40:36] amen i mean i thought i'd just take a
[40:40] moment to give you a little
[40:41] update on myself
[40:44] as you know i got in the car accident
[40:46] and
[40:47] everything was going really good for
[40:50] two or three days and then
[40:52] something started happening
[40:55] and so they diagnosed me with
[40:59] post
[41:00] concussion
[41:02] syndrome
[41:04] so i i go through spells of losing my
[41:07] thought and
[41:08] the doctor told me i shouldn't preach
[41:10] for at least four weeks
[41:13] because
[41:15] he said you're liable to say something
[41:16] just come out of your mouth because
[41:19] well i told i told him i've already done
[41:22] that so
[41:24] but
[41:25] and i told him that's not gonna happen
[41:28] so i'm gonna have to limit the amount of
[41:30] times that i preach maybe just sunday
[41:32] mornings and then
[41:34] it's four to six weeks
[41:37] and
[41:38] so
[41:39] i i just want to let you know it could
[41:42] have been worse you know i thought
[41:44] i i was so mad at myself for wrecking my
[41:47] truck i never did thank the lord for
[41:50] probably from what he really
[41:52] preserved me from because when your egg
[41:54] airbags go off you've been hit
[41:57] pretty hard so
[41:59] i just want to thank the lord so
[42:03] the lord will be my
[42:05] potion he'll be my grace and
[42:08] and so if i seem a little out of it
[42:11] it's only in my head
[42:14] my heart loves the lord
[42:16] my spirit feels him
[42:19] and i'm not supposed to read
[42:21] i'm not supposed to be in any type of
[42:23] social gathering
[42:25] i'm not supposed to listen to
[42:27] any loud noises i thought i'm not
[42:30] supposed to live
[42:32] and
[42:34] and he told me he says well you just got
[42:36] to sleep it off
[42:37] so
[42:38] anyway none of that fits my personality
[42:41] but
[42:42] i think i can do all those things with
[42:44] your prayer
[42:46] and your grace so i'm grateful to have
[42:48] brother paul with us tonight to help us
[42:51] in the labor i'm sure that you'll enjoy
[42:55] the things that he has to share with you
[42:57] and
[42:58] and so just keep me in your prayers and
[43:01] i know i'll get better a lot quicker
[43:04] that way so god bless you we love you so
[43:06] much
[43:07] we will try to be with you sunday
[43:09] morning please extend to me all the
[43:12] grace you can
[43:13] and if i slip up don't chuckle
[43:16] too loud but we will pick up in the

[43:21] reading from is this the rising of the
[43:24] sun it is the rising of the sun

[49:38] i'm going to title my sermon tonight
[49:41] la frieza de la decision
[49:49] [Music]
[49:54] two types of people that took very
[49:56] important
[50:03] and we know that making decisions is
[50:05] something that happens daily
[50:08] upon the decision every day we must make
[50:10] decisions
[50:12] in what we're doing
[50:16] the type of living that we live it's our
[50:18] decision
[50:21] everything that we're doing there's a
[50:23] decision that we must make shock
[50:26] thing and every time we make a decision
[50:31] there's something that's happening
[50:32] behind that decision
[50:37] like as humans obviously it's happened
[50:40] to all of us
[50:43] do to have made a decision within the
[50:46] time frame of our life
[50:50] and to regret the decision that was made
[50:52] the next day
[50:56] and come to the realization that we made
[50:58] the wrong decision
[51:01] but there is only one man
[51:05] who doesn't make that decision twice
[51:10] that first decision that he made
[51:13] is the best party
[51:16] because he knows the end before the
[51:17] beginning
[51:19] and he knows everything that person's
[51:21] the jew and that person is god it's a
[51:24] jeweler and that god vanessa
[51:28] wants to bring us upon no decision on
[51:31] his people to take our decisions in
[51:33] following him
[51:36] because every time we make a decision
[51:40] in following the word of god
[51:43] we are sure
[51:45] that we are not going wrong
[51:48] that
[52:01] and we have the impression that
[52:02] everything has gone dark after the
[52:04] decision
[52:07] as long as that decision was taken
[52:09] according to the cro the conduct of god
[52:15] as long as that decision was made by the
[52:17] word of god japan
[52:20] god will take care of everything
[52:24] we see our father abraham
[52:27] he was a i i i dollared her
[52:30] he was a a pagan
[52:33] god came to him you just saw the
[52:36] thumping he said come out of your
[52:37] country
[52:40] come out of your house
[52:42] come out of your people
[53:12] abraham was conscious that this was god
[53:15] but that knowledge because in the
[53:17] decision
[53:21] to know is it god who's behind us that's
[53:24] a jerky new country is it god who's
[53:26] leading us
[53:29] it could be that in some occasions
[53:33] that god doesn't speak to us by means of
[53:36] dreams
[53:38] god didn't speak to us by audible voices
[53:55] abraham when he heard the voice of god
[53:59] abraham simply obeyed abraham
[54:02] abraham came out
[54:05] but when abraham came out in our country
[54:08] exactly
[54:22] then god asked him to separate himself
[54:26] son god was asking him to come alone the
[54:29] people the decision
[54:31] the most important decisions so that
[54:33] this is not individual it's the decision
[54:36] that i made alone
[55:04] but it's the question of the individual
[55:06] with god gentle
[55:08] what we regardless of the age
[55:11] of that we can come to god
[55:14] and god can speak to us
[55:32] he went to this country
[55:36] god separated him from his father
[55:39] he took he took his dad
[55:43] god separated him from lord
[56:00] talk to him
[56:02] and god made him a promise
[56:06] that he would have a child by sarah
[56:11] it was something that was difficult to
[56:13] believe
[56:26] sometimes we find ourselves in
[56:27] situations
[56:43] was it really god
[56:46] then when before we testified that it
[56:49] was god
[56:52] but abraham waited 25 years
[56:56] when god fulfilled the promise exactly
[57:00] isaac came on the scene
[57:02] is that god gave him isaac
[57:05] who was the heart of abraham
[57:08] when
[57:09] isaac was growing up
[57:13] that the heart of abraham was attached
[57:15] to isaac
[57:18] he knew that he had a uh he had a
[57:20] descendant he had somebody posted he had
[57:23] a posterity as you saw junior power one
[57:26] day the same god came to him
[57:29] he said abraham
[57:31] give me your son dominic your only son
[57:37] if it was you or not
[58:04] abraham knew that god made him the
[58:06] problem
[58:08] it's god who gave him the son earth
[58:12] and if god gave him a son
[58:15] that he was able to resurrect him back
[58:20] abroad abraham made a decision
[58:24] [Music]
[58:25] to offer this child across the city
[58:29] because of that decision
[58:32] god told abraham
[58:34] god of this decision that posterity your
[58:38] prosperity
[58:42] your seed will possess the gates of the
[58:44] enemy
[58:46] you will have a great seed a great
[58:48] multitude of prosperity why of course
[58:50] you like decisions because of the
[58:52] decision that abraham made
[58:56] because abraham made the right decision
[59:00] because abraham trusted god
[59:13] a young man wants to make a decision to
[59:15] marry a young lady
[59:31] and make a reference in the word of god
[59:34] exactly
[59:35] it's the same same thing when isaac
[59:37] started growing up
[59:42] abraham realized that his son had to
[59:44] marry 18
[59:46] that
[59:47] they had to be a bride for isaac
[59:51] there was there was really a attractive
[59:54] young lady in the country where they
[59:56] were living
[59:57] but they were all uh unbelievers
[1:00:01] they were not christians
[1:00:03] the the abraham's heart desire
[1:00:07] it was not the external beauty
[1:00:11] it was a he wanted a woman from the pure
[1:00:15] race
[1:00:20] it says the the uh abraham
[1:00:22] the april visitation to gabriel
[1:00:25] visitation to uh daniel
[1:00:28] he was telling to the young lady who
[1:00:29] were there
[1:00:32] it says i find you very attractive very
[1:00:34] pretty
[1:00:36] it says a beautiful woman
[1:00:39] a beautiful girl the selfie
[1:00:54] a young man who who desire or deserve to
[1:00:58] be married
[1:01:00] will have the same opinion that i do
[1:01:03] that's what i'm saying
[1:01:08] to say that abraham in that time
[1:01:12] he said that isaac had to have a good
[1:01:15] bride
[1:01:17] that's why them tells us
[1:01:20] that for for the young ones that are in
[1:01:34] i remember a story when i was younger
[1:01:38] we had a young sister
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:44] she basically turned down all the young
[1:01:47] men that were uh uh
[1:01:49] coming to her basket don't stop
[1:01:58] she wanted somebody that would meet her
[1:02:00] picture yeah
[1:02:03] and then there was a a a brother from a
[1:02:06] denominational come to her it comes to
[1:02:09] domain
[1:02:12] and because that that the denominational
[1:02:15] brother
[1:02:16] met the physical criteria that she was
[1:02:19] looking for
[1:02:21] she said well he's also a christian
[1:02:25] they got married
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:27] one week later
[1:02:30] she called the brother
[1:02:44] tells the sister yeah you know that too
[1:02:48] he says
[1:02:51] when he said
[1:02:53] under no circumstance
[1:02:57] that a believer should marry an
[1:02:59] unbeliever
[1:03:06] but in order for him to tell us in
[1:03:08] details
[1:03:10] he just said under no circumstances
[1:03:14] and she knew what she was going against
[1:03:17] and for abraham
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:22] he wanted a good wife of isaac
[1:03:27] and and says abraham was a type of god
[1:03:31] exactly
[1:03:32] and isaac was a type of christ
[1:03:38] and abraham had to find a servant
[1:03:43] to whom he had to give the word king
[1:03:46] david
[1:03:47] a certified
[1:03:49] oh the message that was to be carried to
[1:03:51] the woman who was going to marry isaac
[1:03:55] to the uh uh isaac's bride
[1:04:00] he looked among his servants
[1:04:05] he found it to to found a servant who
[1:04:08] was faithful
[1:04:10] who was loyal
[1:04:23] he speaks about that servant
[1:04:39] god's looking for men today that will
[1:04:41] move when this that will move when the
[1:04:44] spirits move

[1:04:55] muslim not only that mcconaughey as a
[1:04:59] destination but when he got to his place
[1:05:02] where his message now was a message
[1:05:05] devoted to deliverance why this message
[1:05:07] was to be given

[1:10:00] give the
[1:10:08] the bible says before he can even finish
[1:10:10] his prayer

[1:10:38] right decision

[1:10:43] decision
[1:10:44] and when he made that decision
[1:10:48] god was obligated to go with him
[1:10:51] god was obligated to hear that prayer
[1:10:55] because he made the right decision
[1:11:02] rebecca showed the virtue of of of
[1:11:06] of the virtuous woman
[1:11:09] the camels they drink a lot
[1:11:14] but rebecca brought water for all of
[1:11:16] them
[1:11:19] when elisa saw that
[1:11:22] he saw the fulfillment of his prayer
[1:11:27] he saw the fulfillment of the word
[1:11:30] he had no doubt
[1:11:34] that rebecca was the one who was who was

[1:11:53] family

[1:12:09] eliza went with riches avec they don't
[1:12:12] he went with gifts affected
[1:12:15] with with gifts
[1:12:18] when god sends a servant johnny
[1:12:22] god himself will equip him
[1:12:26] god will give him everything that he has
[1:12:28] needed
[1:12:30] for the fulfillment of the word
[1:12:35] if you are unless you are a servant who
[1:12:37] is sent by god you cut it up under like
[1:12:39] a journalism
[1:12:41] that you let yourself be used by god
[1:12:44] before what i'm doing
[1:12:46] says
[1:13:01] it says when they took this man to the
[1:13:03] hotel
[1:13:04] only i donate
[1:13:11] i need some help here
[1:13:24] so this man came and he was given two
[1:13:26] gifts for him to take care of the
[1:13:29] the man who was beaten
[1:13:31] it
[1:13:32] and and this person and these two gifts
[1:13:38] don't act
[1:13:39] but says god gives his servants
[1:13:43] the word
[1:13:59] he saw he he was able to show rebecca
[1:14:02] just what the the the the what the gifts
[1:14:06] were and what those things that was
[1:14:07] given were
[1:14:10] god sent us a messenger in this end
[1:14:12] times
[1:14:14] god sent us william branham
[1:14:19] he shows us the wealth of the kingdom of
[1:14:22] god
[1:14:25] and those things didn't belong to
[1:14:26] william brown
[1:14:29] those things didn't belong to rebecca
[1:14:34] those things belong to abraham
[1:14:38] but william branham had to bring them
[1:14:40] and give them to the bride
[1:14:45] it was not things given to him for him
[1:14:47] to boast about himself
[1:14:48] it was only proof cannot be proof that
[1:14:51] our bridegroom
[1:14:53] his elbow god does not report that the
[1:14:57] one who sent our bridegroom
[1:15:00] that when we come to him we'll have
[1:15:02] everything that we have made
[1:15:05] that there was nothing impossible to him
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:22] oh what a precious message
[1:15:25] oh what a precious message
[1:15:28] oh glory to god for this message
[1:15:31] all glory to god for this message
[1:15:34] i can already imagine
[1:15:43] oh what a wonderful day will be
[1:15:46] rebecca was excited
[1:16:03] and the next day eliza said
[1:16:07] god has made my mission accomplished
[1:16:10] god has heard my prayer
[1:16:13] we have to go
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] the brothers and the sisters and the
[1:16:19] parents of rebecca
[1:16:22] they said oh let us stay 10 days with us
[1:16:27] sometimes the things of this world
[1:16:31] sometimes our friend our friends and the
[1:16:34] people of this world
[1:16:36] sometimes the things of the flesh
[1:16:40] it can make the lay of decisions
[1:16:44] but rebecca was so excited
[1:16:57] rebecca knew there was nothing in this
[1:16:59] world that will give her the same
[1:17:01] satisfaction
[1:17:09] that the brothers rebecca's brothers
[1:17:12] they are also preachers
[1:17:29] they don't want us to get too excited
[1:17:32] so we can go meet isaac
[1:17:35] but rebecca was excited
[1:17:38] rebecca believed the message
[1:17:42] the parents came and told her oh rebecca
[1:17:45] you know we love you a lot
[1:17:48] you know if you believe this message
[1:17:51] you know you're so young
[1:17:53] do you know what you're gonna look like
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:17:59] i remember when i was i was still in
[1:18:01] high school
[1:18:03] i was about 17.
[1:18:06] it was a friend from school who came to
[1:18:08] see me
[1:18:09] he said paul
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:23] because your way of acting
[1:18:27] it doesn't fit with the young if you're
[1:18:29] a god i said glory to god
[1:18:32] you know what you said
[1:18:34] you that are young
[1:18:36] when you have the desires of the youth
[1:18:38] come
[1:18:51] and when the family came to see her he
[1:18:54] said oh can you stay they asked her to
[1:18:56] stay with him he didn't know she said no
[1:18:59] eliza told me
[1:19:01] that my lord
[1:19:03] isaac
[1:19:05] he's impatient he wants to see me
[1:19:08] he said can you stay with us
[1:19:12] the family said okay we'll go ask
[1:19:13] rebecca
[1:19:15] when they ask rebecca the question
[1:19:19] rebecca said
[1:19:36] i don't know the road
[1:19:38] i've never seen ice again
[1:19:41] but he told me about isis
[1:19:44] the way he described isis
[1:19:47] the way he
[1:19:48] presented to me the gift of isaac
[1:19:51] when he when he showed me the power of
[1:19:53] isis
[1:19:54] i couldn't wait
[1:19:56] i have to go
[1:19:58] i'm going now
[1:20:02] and when rebecca made that decision
[1:20:06] just like by prophecy
[1:20:08] his brothers
[1:20:10] who were not with abraham
[1:20:13] when abraham when god told abraham
[1:20:41] we don't have to wait for god to make
[1:20:43] decisions on our behalf
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:21:00] you'll see that all that were victorious
[1:21:04] they made a decision
[1:21:07] look at david that's your number this
[1:21:09] young man innocent innocent guinness
[1:21:11] combat who never
[1:21:26] shaking before god
[1:21:28] it's just like kids
[1:21:31] and when gay this little young man david
[1:21:33] shows up
[1:21:34] he looks at everybody just moving aside
[1:21:37] david looked at it
[1:21:39] oh they said david hide hide he said
[1:21:42] what's going on
[1:21:45] look
[1:21:47] goddammit
[1:21:48] when david looks he went
[1:21:50] he sees and uncircumcised
[1:21:54] everybody else they were looking at the
[1:21:57] giant
[1:21:58] but when david looks
[1:22:00] he sees an uncircumcised
[1:22:02] he says what's the problem
[1:22:16] who can uh come and curse the army of
[1:22:19] the living god
[1:22:21] who's this uncircumcised
[1:22:25] david didn't know what to do
[1:22:28] david was persuaded
[1:22:32] that if i go in the name of the lord
[1:22:34] jesus
[1:22:36] as
[1:22:41] regardless of what's going to happen to
[1:22:43] me
[1:22:44] i will be victorious it is your validity
[1:22:46] it says aggravate him
[1:23:19] his armor on him
[1:23:21] when he tried to walk
[1:23:23] he couldn't walk
[1:23:24] he said i'll take this off
[1:23:26] i'll go to fight him
[1:23:28] with what
[1:23:30] he looks around he looks around
[1:23:32] he
[1:23:37] a pocket with seven stones
[1:23:40] in the name of jesus
[1:23:41] five stones just to see that
[1:23:43] it says i have what i have need off
[1:23:46] in order for me to stand in front of
[1:23:48] this circumcision
[1:23:49] david made a decision
[1:23:53] and because of that decision i could
[1:23:55] have said god because of this great
[1:23:58] decision
[1:24:00] god was obligated to go with david
[1:24:04] with a simple stone
[1:24:07] god brought down goliath
[1:24:11] god only needs what we already have
[1:24:23] sometimes the decision the most
[1:24:25] important decision
[1:24:26] what all god is asking is
[1:25:18] because of the power the decision that
[1:25:20] he made
[1:25:23] we read the story
[1:25:33] the children of israel god brought him
[1:25:34] out of egypt in a miraculous way
[1:25:40] they have seen miracles like no other
[1:25:43] people have seen these villa
[1:25:46] they saw the power of god let them play
[1:25:49] on egypt
[1:25:50] let there ten plagues in egypt
[1:26:01] he comes and he stands between them and
[1:26:03] the phil and the egyptians
[1:26:14] but regardless of all those things
[1:26:18] yeah they are in caddesh barnia
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:49] and when they came back
[1:26:51] when it came time to give the report
[1:26:55] these people
[1:26:57] that had seen all that god did from
[1:26:59] egypt
[1:27:13] it's a good country that flows with milk
[1:27:16] and honey we know
[1:27:19] that the message is good
[1:27:24] give us a message just to leave this
[1:27:27] message
[1:27:30] no now
[1:27:42] you know like in front of them we look
[1:27:44] just like grasshoppers
[1:27:49] and ashes were arguing about this
[1:27:52] and the people were shaking
[1:27:56] and people were asking themselves
[1:27:58] questions
[1:28:08] was it not that was is it because there
[1:28:10] were no tombs in nature
[1:28:20] so we can go back to egypt
[1:28:23] they didn't even think
[1:28:26] how are they going to do so they can
[1:28:28] cross back the right side
[1:28:33] because that god was no longer with them
[1:28:38] and has the world discouraging the
[1:28:40] people can't let caleb
[1:28:44] he says shut up
[1:28:46] take them keep quiet
[1:28:51] i made a decision
[1:28:55] that i'm going to meet those people just
[1:28:57] say i know
[1:29:00] if they are big measure celsius but i
[1:29:02] also know that you know
[1:29:05] that god has promised us this country
[1:29:07] that i promised the jew that the promise
[1:29:10] of god
[1:29:13] is over the heights of these people
[1:29:16] for me that if god has promised
[1:29:18] something
[1:29:20] that is able to give us what he promised
[1:29:35] my decision
[1:29:39] is to god the way god has asked me to go
[1:29:45] god told him
[1:29:47] and if god said and if he said
[1:29:52] he said he watches over his promise to
[1:29:54] fulfill them
[1:29:56] as christians
[1:29:59] when we take the word of god
[1:30:01] when we take the message of god
[1:30:17] regardless of the enemy or the devil
[1:30:20] that under no circumstances one time
[1:30:23] manufacturing
[1:30:25] that he can bring us to believe that our
[1:30:27] god is incapable
[1:30:29] of
[1:30:30] because he's always able
[1:30:44] he made a good decision a right decision
[1:30:47] in his life
[1:30:50] he was talking about
[1:30:51] a story about in a meeting
[1:30:56] a prophecy came out in french
[1:31:01] there was someone who prophesied when
[1:31:03] barbara was preaching
[1:31:05] and the prophecy was saying
[1:31:10] because you chose the harder way
[1:31:15] the more difficult road pasco
[1:31:19] don't propagate because you walk on your
[1:31:22] own will cut your pillow this is your
[1:31:25] correct that you made the right decision
[1:31:28] a
[1:31:29] and precisely
[1:31:33] and because it's my way i caught a
[1:31:36] certain part of this because of this
[1:31:38] important decision
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:43] look a portion of heaven will be given
[1:31:45] unto you
[1:31:46] glorious decision beca what an important
[1:31:50] choice decision
[1:31:52] that the one that you have chosen
[1:31:58] in that decision there will come a
[1:32:00] tremendous victory
[1:32:04] and it will be fulfilling love the vine
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] the same way that caleb made the right
[1:32:11] choice the right decision
[1:32:13] and god told caleb i caught the target
[1:32:16] because of your decision
[1:32:20] there is a morsel or a portion of the
[1:32:22] land that's waiting for you over there
[1:32:24] god also told william branham
[1:32:26] because of this decision
[1:32:29] there is a portion of heaven awaiting
[1:32:31] for you
[1:32:33] the power of decision
[1:32:35] when we make the right decision
[1:32:38] there
[1:32:53] and not let the little things of the
[1:32:55] world
[1:32:56] attract our attention
[1:32:58] but you know some defeated that we are
[1:33:01] sons and daughters of god
[1:33:04] that we are sons and daughters of god
[1:33:35] but god is calling us to make the right
[1:33:37] decision
[1:33:40] tells the story
[1:33:42] if there was a preacher
[1:33:45] when he was preaching
[1:33:48] there was a brother who came
[1:33:50] he said
[1:33:52] he said i gave my life to the lord yes
[1:33:55] and i will give my testimony
[1:33:58] i will tell how i gave my life to the
[1:34:00] lord
[1:34:02] the pastor said oh glory to god he did
[1:34:04] your affliction he said oh bro
[1:34:07] i am really happy
[1:34:11] to know that you finally made the right
[1:34:12] decision
[1:34:14] but i want to know
[1:34:16] tell
[1:34:19] he said what is it of the sermon that i
[1:34:21] preached
[1:34:24] oh what's what what what or what part of
[1:34:26] the scripture i read
[1:34:31] or what song what marvelous song we sang
[1:34:33] guitar
[1:34:35] that has brought you to come and make
[1:34:37] this decision did it possible he said
[1:34:39] because some pluton
[1:34:43] because i don't want to hurt your
[1:34:44] feelings
[1:34:47] is that because there's many times that
[1:34:48] you come to church
[1:34:52] but we knew that you were a
[1:34:54] a very uh
[1:34:56] uh you were
[1:34:57] angry person
[1:35:00] that you were you were mistreating your
[1:35:02] wife
[1:35:05] that you spend all your money in alcohol
[1:35:08] that you you you left you you lived the
[1:35:11] wrong kind of life
[1:35:22] what preaching what sermon caused you to
[1:35:25] make this decision
[1:35:26] what
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:40] is that you preach wonderful sermons
[1:35:44] and we sing we sing wonderful songs
[1:35:47] but it wasn't dead
[1:35:49] that brought me to bring to come and
[1:35:51] make this decision
[1:35:53] where i work
[1:36:36] because i want to be like you i mean
[1:36:39] bring me where your god is suppose
[1:36:41] and that's how i came here
[1:36:44] to give my life to the lord
[1:36:49] that god can speak to us through
[1:36:50] preaching
[1:36:53] god can speak to us through songs
[1:36:58] god can speak to us through the lives of
[1:37:00] the christians
[1:37:02] that's why god wants to bring us
[1:37:17] for one
[1:37:18] another and that's a decision that we
[1:37:21] have to make
[1:37:23] because the bible tells us
[1:37:25] in second peter chapter one
[1:37:29] when they speak about the stature of the
[1:37:30] perfect man they are defeated for
[1:37:34] peter's saying that make do make all
[1:37:36] your efforts
[1:37:39] that we have to do all that we can
[1:37:42] allah
[1:37:43] that we can bring from the faith we had
[1:37:45] virtue
[1:38:00] patients
[1:38:15] we have to make our decisions
[1:38:19] to follow the lord
[1:38:23] the decision to receive this holy spirit
[1:38:28] not not just to be happy to come to
[1:38:30] church
[1:38:31] it's good to come to church
[1:38:34] it's good to be a member who's known by
[1:38:36] all
[1:38:38] but god doesn't need that
[1:38:41] god wants us to be on fire
[1:39:11] he says
[1:39:15] he said i'm guilty with you
[1:39:18] i've made up my mind
[1:39:23] by the help of god of god's grace see
[1:39:26] not rejoice forth the faith by help and
[1:39:29] grace of god and if our god will give me
[1:39:32] the strength to do it
[1:39:36] i'm determined to press towards the mark
[1:39:51] till death shall set me free
[1:39:55] god be my helper to do so
[1:39:58] help me in my prayer
[1:40:00] it's my prayer
[1:40:02] seeing my works
[1:40:05] seeing the things that i have seen
[1:40:08] and that you have seen
[1:40:12] and lagging behind
[1:40:13] because of a spiritual be because it is
[1:40:17] spiritual enemy and because and become a
[1:40:20] spiritual amnesia
[1:40:24] in paragraph 102 he says
[1:40:29] oh how we need to pray
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:35] now we'll get it says now we'll get back
[1:40:37] to you again
[1:40:43] do you realize that we don't pray half
[1:40:46] as much as our father did
[1:40:56] do you know that we don't put much time
[1:40:58] on our knees as the pastors before us
[1:41:01] did
[1:41:02] women
[1:41:12] do you realize that you don't instruct
[1:41:14] your daughter and pray with her at night
[1:41:16] like your mother did i did you allah
[1:41:19] connected to her then what about it
[1:41:23] who is guilty
[1:41:25] we are guilty
[1:41:28] there is no way around it
[1:41:30] we
[1:41:38] i'm guilty of not doing the job of of
[1:41:41] god
[1:41:43] like i should do i'm confessing it
[1:41:45] yesterday
[1:41:46] that i'm wrong
[1:41:50] i'm asking god to be merciful to me
[1:41:57] i look out here and see all the
[1:41:59] opportunities that i've missed
[1:42:02] because of little things of all the
[1:42:04] insignificant things that didn't mean
[1:42:06] nothing i want to do more i'm ashamed of
[1:42:08] myself
[1:42:10] as a as a gospel minister
[1:42:15] i repent before god
[1:42:18] and i asked god to forgive me
[1:42:24] for the truth and the church to forgive
[1:42:26] me for being so dilatory about the work
[1:42:28] of god well i gutted you by the grace of
[1:42:31] god if i let the jews and by the help of
[1:42:33] god

[1:42:55] the program i know i know god's program
[1:42:59] it's written out here in the bible
[1:43:04] and i'm ashamed of myself as a minister
[1:43:06] of the gospel

[1:43:28] been a christian

[1:44:32] when we realize everything that is done
[1:44:34] for the lord
[1:44:37] and we re when we we look at what we
[1:44:39] ourselves what we are doing
[1:44:43] it's time that we make a decision
[1:44:46] to serve this lord

[1:44:51] if the musician could come
[1:44:56] that when you come in contact with the
[1:44:57] lord
[1:44:59] in that time
[1:45:26] in other words the consequence of the
[1:45:28] spirit coming upon you
[1:45:30] you will be my witnesses
[1:45:33] god gives us his holy spirit
[1:45:36] god fills us with this holy spirit
[1:45:40] that we may become his witnesses
[1:45:52] that we may speak to somebody else about
[1:45:54] this message
[1:46:11] in if in some things
[1:46:14] we ask ourselves questions
[1:46:16] are we in the will of god or not
[1:46:22] the only thing that we are sure to be on
[1:46:24] when
[1:46:38] preach the good news to all the

[1:58:29] what you've given us
[1:58:32] lord some of us may be better with words
[1:58:34] as we might witness to
[1:58:35] someone out on the streets or to work
[1:58:38] some of us lord may be better with just
[1:58:40] a life
[1:58:41] not a lot spoken lord but we do have the
[1:58:43] responsibility to make sure that this
[1:58:45] message is shown to the world
[1:58:48] i pray lord that each time that we're
[1:58:49] given that opportunity that we meet that
[1:58:51] challenge
[1:58:53] sometimes we'll be the only one that
[1:58:56] someone will see and they'll recognize
[1:58:57] christ in us they may never open a bible
[1:58:59] they may never hear a sermon
[1:59:01] lord but we need to have a life that's
[1:59:03] on display
[1:59:04] even as brother paul spoke tonight a
[1:59:06] type of rebecca when we first heard this
[1:59:08] message we
[1:59:10] we were so in we were so enthused lord
[1:59:12] that we didn't maybe know
[1:59:15] what we would call rules or regulations
[1:59:17] or how to dress or what to do or how to
[1:59:19] act lord but
[1:59:20] you allowed the holy spirit to come over
[1:59:22] us and brood and speak to us and start
[1:59:24] to show us your mind and what your
[1:59:26] thoughts were
[1:59:27] lord and that's what's shaping us in
[1:59:28] this last hour
[1:59:30] lord i pray that each one was dealt with
[1:59:32] tonight accordingly may we go out of
[1:59:34] here lord living a life for you that is
