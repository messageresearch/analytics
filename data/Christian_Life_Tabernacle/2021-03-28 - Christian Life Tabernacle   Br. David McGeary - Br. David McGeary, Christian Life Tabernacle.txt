their love that they have for you we can always remember that you first loved us therefore we love you we ask you to be with us in jesus name we pray amen amen let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelations and the first chapter of the book of revelations and let's read at the 17th verse and it says you have the 17th verse of the first chapter of revelations and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and half the keys of hell and of death heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated just a a short time of fellowship together this is uh i guess what they call easter season it's uh easter time in fact it just seems like it comes upon us like all of a sudden we're here and i was at my mom's house and i was driving down some of the streets with leslie where i grew up and and uh come across this a park where we all just kind of played as kids where the rec center was and this sunday they're having a bunny trail and you know and i i just sat back and and i i i thought you know such a wonderful time of year what it is that we're celebrating and it's been the truth of it's been so uh taken away from uh mankind that the the fact that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that that would have been good enough that if i would have just known that uh that my sins were forgiven and there'd be nothing uh laid to my charge and and that i could have lived a good life by following the things of the lord i'd be blessed my conscience would be clear i would have peace and especially looking around and seeing all the people that are in turmoil and and the people that are depressed and the people that are on drugs and alcohol and and lined up to see the psychiatrist and and uh i could have just sat back and thought well look at how a happy i am and and what a great comfort in a peaceable life that i have that would be a reward to me in comparison to the misery that is out there you know i mean people can't get along and marriages don't last they seem to fall apart and out and if it just just be able to sit back and say because i followed the bible and i i followed this great man the lord jesus and i did what he said and i stayed away from hurting people and i stayed away from stealing and i kept the commandments the peace and joy that it gives me that's wonderful but just think he proved to us that there is more to come you know i i i like that part okay we've only had a foretaste of glory divine the joy that we feel and the confidence that we have it is just a just such a small a portion of of what laid they had and that's what he did on that great beautiful day you know that he rose he he you know he said that that that i i'm i'm he that was uh i'm alive he says i'm he that's alive in other words i'm not history anymore i'm present i'm alive i'm he that's alive and i'm forevermore i'm the same yesterday today and forever i was dead okay you know what i mean but i'm alive and uh and and so and fear not i i just like to it just made me think you know i i guess i would say that all of a sudden easter's here and uh i think next weekend there's an easter meeting and many of our people will be uh going over to have a time of easter and a time of fellowship and get together with other believers that believe that he's a risen from the dead that he overcame death hell and what is hell health's a separation from god he's overcame man's separation for god he brought us back into communion he brought us back into fellowship and so now we can sit back and we know that we're that all the joy that we have in this life it is just something to let us know that there's a greater life to come and because that he has risen from the dead that's the life that we're living for we're living for that promise and it just seems like the enemy wants to take this world and this life and swallow us up he wants us just to get so caught up in the burdens and the struggles of this life and he he just keeps making the struggles harder and harder you know i uh we were spending a lot of time with my mom and telling us you know of of things that it was you know when they they used to have milk bands does anybody ever remember a milkman i guess i'm probably the oldest person in the building at this evening and so i remember a milkman i remember the little quart bottles of milk and sitting on our porch in a little wire basket and getting the milkman and right before i left california we had a a milkman that came to our house and brought milk and ice cream and all those things now i think milk was 50 cents a gallon i i don't know what it is now i don't even know if you can buy a gal in a mill but anyway i bet you it's over two dollars right for a gallon a mil yeah no wonder i don't go shopping i i get mad at the whole store you know what i mean a banana for a dollar you know what i mean uh just think you could work a whole hour and buy a gallon of milk and a banana and and it just it you know it just she just seems wants to rob us of our joy but our joy is in the resurrection that's what houses our joy that's what houses our hope that's what houses the reason that we live the way that we live is because of the great hope of the resurrection and and so at easter i just like to read a few statements and just kind of ramble on a little bit this evening but when he proved by his promise this great conquering power that he had on easter so he proved on easter this great conquering power that he had so when he came out of that grave he proved that he had a power that would conquer and it was a great conquering power so we're not just honoring him for a good life and which he did we're not honoring him for the works and the miracles that he did that we could look at that and say he he he could heal the sick he could uh he could cast out devils he could do all these things but yet it yet it wouldn't matter if he still had to die and we we might have been able to say well if we followed what he taught and we followed the life pattern that he had and we lived by his rules and we treated people the way he treated another if we pattern our lives after his life we might be able to uh encompass and possess the love and the power to do these same works but yet our end would be the same we would die so we would have had a better life and a happier life and a joyful life and a more peaceful life than the person that was always looking over their shoulder to see if the cops were gonna come after him or the person that was always in a conflict with somebody fussing and arguing and and had a miserable life we'd have a great life a peaceful life we'd had a wonderful time living the uh and and being happy following the teachings of jesus and we might have been able to pray people and see great things happen but the final end would have been death the difference would have been we would have died happy and somebody else would have died miserable and that that would have been it but we realized that he had a greater power a greater conquering power and that power that he had was the conquering power that he conquered death he conquered the finality of death and even someone that dies now they still if they're not alive then they still have death it's just that death hadn't finished its course you understand so they die but they don't die you just leave this body so that death they leave this body and then they go face the fire that that is waiting for them the reward of their works and then that death and that separation of god finally takes its toll and they're no more so eventually they are eternally separated from god and therefore they die and that's what we would refer to as the second death so you know death has two parts it has the part of the separating of your body and then it has the death of your spirit and that's the second death and so we sit back and we realize that this great easter what this great easter did for us is that we realized that he had the power to conquer the first death but that would have been good but we wanted something that proved that he had conquered the second death and that's what he said i'm the one that liveth i'm alive in other words the second death hasn't had taken his toll on me and i live forever more in other words the life that's in me is eternal life not only did i conquer the first death but i conquered the second death and so that that's just such a wonderful thing to realize because i would hate to think that i lived here and then i got like this next death but i had the second death but no he's overcome at all and that's what's so beautiful about easter he says when he proved by his promise this great conquering power that he had on easter he proved that he could conquer death hell and hell's what produces the second death and the grave i am he that was dead and is alive again and alive for evermore and have the keys to death and hell and the grave what a statement for anybody to make not only did he make it but he already proved that he had what he claimed to have now listen to this great statement that he makes so when he arose and he came back and then he promised us the same spirit that was in me the same spirit that quickened me the same spirit that gave me power over death hell and the grave i'm going to send that same spirit back to you this is my gift to you the gift of god is eternal life through christ jesus that's the great gift that that god gave us so it's not just that we live right it's not just that we're preaching a morality it's not just that we're preaching a righteousness but we've actually received something from him that goes beyond this world it goes beyond this life as we sometimes we refer to it as a token another and a token is like a ticket it's something that that allows you to to get in to some place it's like a car wash you know i hate those car washes that give you tokens you know what i mean they don't give you quarters so you walk away with anything you have a token that says that you it it's paid for so you gotta use them up we went to a token car wash and we we vacuumed the car with it and we were done so we still had tokens left so we had to stay there five more minutes and and vacuum the mats and vacuum underneath the seat why we wanted to get our monies worked you know and uh uh because we had a token well that's what a token is it's a price paid that's right so he comes and he says that this great spirit this great conquering power he gives it to us and it becomes the token it becomes the price paid it becomes that that now we possess the payment for the second death we because we're all gonna suffer the first death and that's the the of the hour of the end of it all when he raptures his church and we all have that great hope that uh that we're here for that in that event what we really ought to be hoping for is that we have the faith to accept it and see it when it happens i think if this if the rapture came right now i think it would scare the gizzard out of most of us instead of it being something that we really uh really embraced you know whoa the rapture's on i've been waiting for this i'm actually going to change and i'm going to submit my body and my spirit to a transformation i'm going to step out no getting on your cell phone and calling your wife and saying sweetheart i won't be home for dinner i'm going to be raptured you know you would just have to walk right into it step right there it's almost going to be like a realm appears in front of you and you've got to step out of this realm just step right into that other realm just step across yes sir you know okay well you sure not you sure not bear be wanting and loving all kinds of things in this world you're not going to tell them angels well can i take this with me can i take that with me no can you imagine the choices put before you and now or never how long will you have to make the choice a twinkling of an eye just that quick that that's what we're living for that's what we're preparing for that's what we're that's what we're working towards this is what this a cry and our heart is is to overcome the cry in our heart is to overcome is for the purpose of i want to overcome because i want to be in rapturing condition i want to be mentally sharp for the rapture i want my spirit hungry for the rapture i want to be ready to cross over to step the divide i want to have that great spirit of life in me i want something in me that identifies with it so when it comes it it's like a magnet together it comes together and it's that last it's that other piece of the paper that just fits together and it's i'm gone and i'm out of here so uh it's it's that that great beauty he says now he says but he has already proved that he had what he claimed to have and that's what he did he said i'm i i'm i'm life that was his testimony i am the way the truth the life and now he comes back and he proves that he possessed what he was talking about and and brother bam goes on to say i think god hasten that day in other words bring that day to us even so come quickly lord jesus lord we want that day bring that day make us ready i'm hungry in my heart i want to overcome what do what is it that i want to overcome i want to overcome hell death in the grain i want to overcome this world that's killing me spiritually i want to overcome this world that just makes me old and feeds me corrupt food and and brings sickness and disease and heartache i i want out you know i really think that's what i i'm hearing for so many people they just they hear the stuff that's going on and they shake their heads and they say i'm just so sick of this world i have people that aren't maybe don't even have the hope of the resurrection like we do saying i'm sick of this place i'm sick of politics i'm sick of the world i'm i don't even want to read the newspaper anymore you know the all there is is atrocities going on and and you can't even seem to get your mind to think i i thought of the other day as many of you know my mom's still being on my heart from the trip but my mom's a catholic and so you know she watches the mass and watches catholic television and and i'll sit in there sometimes and listen to the priests talk and the nuns talk and everything and it's oh don't think they're way out in left field they're so close it would deceive the very elect it's just they happen to have mediators and saints they pray to and they think they could say the priest changes the body and blood and the pope's the vicar of christ well you know i i thought you know our prophet taught us that this is the age of of the woman and it is and i don't mean that negative but the the the true christian woman is the representative of the true church and the other woman is the representation of the other church she appeared appeared to be beautiful but there was death in her and so there there's a great move as you know in our country today to first of all to withstand the word of god and the word of god said that cr he created them male and female and male and female they he created them so that we know that god created a man and a woman and they're trying to do away with that now the whole idea of everybody being equal well let me tell you something god does not deal an equal equal is a sweetener for coffee there the equality of god the equality of god is he has no respecter of person he doesn't judge you on your personality if he judged us on our looks i would be there for sure but he does he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't judge us on our looks you know he doesn't judge us on our swagger and our personality you know i see some people walk and you just think that that they just are walking with so much jive you know what i mean that you just think that oh my goodness what do you why are you walking like that well i'm king of the world you know what i mean and uh uh you know so it he doesn't judges find me that he he himself doesn't judge us it's his word that judging us we're judged by the the word of god that's what the that's what it comes down to and and so it's not an idea of being equal the equality only comes in the fact that he created some vessels unto honor and some unto dishonor it can that's where it goes well so the this equality movement has not just in the political world but it had moved into the catholic church where many of the people that are in the catholic church they they believe that mary is the mother of god okay and and first of all that's wrong she's not the mother of god there was no part of mary used in the birth of jesus that's right god created both parts in the womb of mary and let him come into the world in the same path that every sinner came into the world but he was the lamb of god there was no sin or unbelief found in him and the very creation of man in in the in the physical realm was based on sin so he he overcame that sin right there showing that he could overcome every part of it and so that he came into the world and he he was sinless but every part but they believe that mary is the mother of god and therefore being god's mother she must be equal and so there there was a great movement and there's still a great movement in the church and let me tell you something about great movements what a movement does when people believe a certain thing it might get repudiated and it might get turned down but they keep prevailing and working on the thinking and working on the people until it becomes a consensus and then it's accepted that's why you've got to be anchored in the word of god that nothing moves you from the scriptures you've got to have an absolute you've got this bible has got to be an absolute and i can say it like this and by the revelation of god's word because god deals by revelation uh anybody can take this bible and somebody will come up with all kinds of different ideas but when this bible is revealed to you and quickened to you then that spirit can go through that word of god and put every bit of it together amen you you don't find this message outside of the scriptures it's revealed to you in the scriptures it get it shows you what this scripture means and now that scripture takes on life but so what they've decided was was they decided that mary was equal to jesus therefore she also is a forgiver of sins and she also is one that can make restitution and pay the price and therefore sheik now becomes an object of worship and that is paganism the very fact that they pray to saints is paganism well you say well why are we worried about the catholic church boy that's the beast that's the one that's going to control it all that's the one that's going to get the money that's the one that's going to birth the unity of the church and the unity of politics and religion coming together you know a good cruise through your church age book wouldn't be a a bad idea to really understand that all this political and church and all this coming together and and all these things that are are raising up is is all for the purpose and so they they have this great thing that mary and jesus are equal and that you can pray to mary for the forgiveness of sins and there's thousands and millions of people in service around the world going to mass and instead of praying to the lord they pray to mary they already pray to mary but now they're giving her power to forgive sins and and and hey but we sit back but think people are taking these thinkings in their mind and and so uh going back to this great statement that we said i think god hasten the day when we as christians who believe this bible can prove what we are talking about that's what makes the salt of the earth as the sister said a while ago that's right the world is looking for this salt when we can prove by our lives and by the bible that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that is the day that we're looking for that's the day that we're looking for when our lives can prove that this bible that our and vindicate the word to be living today that that's what we want that's our cry to overcome that's what's part of our overcome i want to overcome everything in my life that's keeping this word from living in me now that so we want to uh we understood this morning just in fellowshipping that that in order to overcome we have to come face to face with the things that were desiring to overcome we've got to come face to face with him you know we can't skirt the issue we can't blow it off for another day if it's there it's there if it's in our life it's in our life there's no need starting to say i'm never going to do this again i i made up my mind that that this is the last time i'm going to do this and this is the last time i'm gonna get mad this is the last time and make this great constitution of this is it i made up my mind i'm never again no we gotta say we gotta come face to face with it we got to say here it is this is my problem i i i realize it and and you and that's something that's going on in you privately that you you're the only one that knows if everybody knows the the the side of the parts of you that are human and ungodly you do we you know when i look out here you're all in church so you know you're 99 there already and that's just from my view but you know what's going on inside of you and then we added a little bit to that this morning saying no you got to come in contact you got to be honest you got to look in the mirror you got to realize i've got to deal with this person and then we understood that overcoming is not just quitting but you've got to replace whatever it is that you're wanting to change with another work or another action or as we said this morning you've got to take up the responsibility that you left to participate in the thing you want to overcome another word for works is responsibility to take the responsibility so we're looking what we're looking for is we are we're looking or we're salty we're thirsty we're hungering after that that that day that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that our lives are vindicating that word so we saw the message vindicated and that's what we talked about we just don't have a message but we've got a vindicated message so it's like you have two great scholars here and one takes the bible and he teaches all their doctrine and their idea of the godhead and their idea of grace and their idea of calvary and great intellectual enticing words and they build into this great picture and here comes another person now he might not be so much an oratory and he might not have be able to put all kinds of different things together things you never thought about and everything and give a great explanation but when it comes down to it he does the same works of the resurrection he prays for the sick and they get well he cast out devils he does the things he discerns the thoughts intents of the heart so now you have one that's by word only and paul said i didn't come unto you with enticing words i didn't come unto you only with the words but i came unto you with power and demonstration of the spirit so when you weigh them equally one's got proving that this word lives and and proving that it's made alive today every promise go into all the world and preach the gospel lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover there's one proving that that power is alive today so the power that overcame hell death in the grave that quickening power is now been returned back to the believer so that they can possess that same spirit that quickened him and so now we sit back and we say the same spirit that dwell in jesus christ if that same spirit dwell in you it will also quicken you it will also give you power to overcome and so we we sit back in it and and that's what we believe he says that's what we're looking for that's what we're hungering for and and i'll just go back to this this great principle of the deep calling to the deep you only call for it because it's there to respond how many years have we been in this message that we've followed this for years and years but now there's more of a cried overcoming there's ever been why because the spirit's there to respond it's the time it's the hour and so the very fact that there was sulfur remember the story of the boy in the petal there he couldn't have been craving sulfur if there wasn't a sulfur to respond the only the great reason that we've got this great cry to overcome because there's overcoming power to respond luther never cried for what we cried for wesley never cried for what we cried for pentecost never cried for what we cried for pentecost cried for a working spirit now we're we're not crying to stay we're trying to leave we're crying for the spirit that will quicken us we're crying for the spirit that will change us we're kind of for the spirit that gives us of the the the the earnest and and the seal yes sir amen amen that we possess and it's ours and we hold the token that's that's paid the price of the second death and he said that's what the scripture says in romans 8 11 if this spirit that raised up jesus christ be in you it will also quicken your mortal body not only did he prove to us that he was jehovah redeemer and had power over death hell in the grave but he also giving us access to the same spirit that we ourselves can have the assurance that we too are quickened by that spirit for the spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwells in your body it will also quicken your mortal body just think what it is that we're celebrating we're celebrating the spirit that rose jesus from the dead has returned and we can possess that spirit also not just the doctrine now that's why that we we that it's not just the doctrines of brother branham that we're trying to learn but it's the spirit that performed and vindicated the word that's the spirit we want and that's because he said this simple thing he says now it's the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens not the word that quickens but listen it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does that now we're saying this because so many times we we think that i get the spirit and and that's the end of it but that's not how the spirit works the spirit quickens it it it's it's the quickening power that that just keeps it coming it's something present and uh and he says so now here's a great statement that i want my minister brothers to try to understand this in the beginning god the great spirit he wasn't even god then he was the eternal one god is an object of worship he had nothing to worship him there was no angel no nothing just god alone he alone is eternal but in order to be god he had to have something worship him so he created angels being serpents and so forth to worship him this great plan began to unfold but remember you in the statue that you are in this morning if you are not in his thinking then you are not now there is some part that is in you that is eternal and eternal only belongs to god though there's some part in you okay and in god he was thinking of you sitting right here where you are now he is thinking i stood in the i stood at the pulpit this morning because he in the beginning because he's eternal and you being sons of god and daughters of god then you were in his thinking in the beginning then when the holy spirit come and you are on earth walking around here in the center way down in your life there is something you don't know what is taking place but you're hungry now that that principle it still applies you don't know what what it is but but you're hungry you don't know what it is you're just walking around here you're living right you're doing good and all of a sudden you've got this cry in your heart i want to overcome i want to go higher yes sir what's what's happening that that that was laying in you all the time but you've been in this message 15 20 years and you've never felt the way you feel now there's never been an urgency we never really thought it would could possibly come to an end but now we realize this thing could be gone in a minute i know most of you don't spend a lot of time on the news and and i don't recommend it you spend a week in a room in on the news and listening to all that stuff up there will you'll be in my office asking me if you should take valium or something because it's depressing it's depressing they're worried about wars they're worried about their lives changing well you know you don't have to worry about your life changing if god's changed your life amen you want change the change you want is a change of body a change of what world you live in amen all your desires turn around everything changes in you okay so this this spirit we're just walking around here and but there's something in you he says oh i oh a wayward man or woman this morning when you're sitting here and there's something in you telling you this is right it's the holy spirit seeking you out to bring you to the knowledge of the truth of this hour that we're now living not some hour that's gone by but the hour now you understand that we're not the spirit is not moving on us to bring us to the knowledge of the hour of the vindication and the delivering of the message we believe that exactly the same way we believe that jesus walked on earth but we're not worshiping the jesus that walked on earth because he said i am he that was dead and alive forevermore that's the jesus we're working the one that's here to give to us the quickening power over death hell and the grave that's the one we're worshiping not a history study that's what we've got to say that's what the prophet god said i think we're getting too many people to church instead of the christ what is he he is the resurrection and the life that's how he describes himself i am the resurrection and the life i'm not the man that did the good works i'm more than that i am resurrection if you have me you will rise also as i rose and i overcome so will you rise and you will overcome i have prayed for you i have died for you and now i'm here to quicken or to make alive the word seed that's in you to to make it alive so it's the spirit that quickens it it's not uh it's not that he said now the statue that you're in this morning if you you're always in this thinking so you were always there and um so we we understand what this easter means to us what makes it so so beautiful and the and i'm going to close but he says now let me read this the holy now the holy spirit is here on earth looking out those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as he finds it it does it does just like it did on jesus christ the great super son of god who redeemed us all it comes down and takes its place of abode in that human life so when it finds you and you and you see it it comes down and it takes a boat in that human life so now it's there you're possessing now notice it brought the quickening power now that quickening power that came upon jesus and quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the holy spirit comes down upon us in this day it's not a mockery holy spirit you're not the devil mocking the holy spirit but it's the real true holy spirit it'll manifest the promises of this hour so you understand that he gives this quickening power this power that raised him from the dead he sends that power in you to take a boat but it didn't make you perfect all at once now it's abiding in you to bring the promises to life you're in it maybe you don't even know the promise is there maybe you don't even have the revelation of your position maybe you don't even understand where you fit in but because you're a son of god because you believed because you accepted the sacrifice because you've come to that place where you hungered and thirst that spirit now comes and takes its abode in you now it's there but it's there to quicken it's there to quicken the word so you have it because you've been predestinated to have it he found you and when he found you and there's something in your heart cried out that's right and you saw it you accepted that and it took its abode now it's abiding there if you abide in me and i abide in you the works that i did you shall do also it didn't say all of a sudden you're going to walk out there and start laying your hands on the sick you're not going to drive down to john peter smith and put it out of business that spirit's abiding to quicken that word in season there's many things in this message that we've read for years and we've never seen but all of a sudden our eyes are coming open we're starting to understand things the world has got in a condition to create the contrast that we can now see it for what it really is amen and that's what he said i counsel thee to buy of me i said that thou mayest see and now the eyes have of god's word the condition of the world the hatred in the world the bias the prejudice all those things that's in the world today the miserable america that's right it's true in our hearts we're starting to say hey i'm of another kingdom [Applause] i'm out of this world every time i get all upset about things that are going on leslie just says you know this world is not my home [Applause] and i want to say wait a minute would you shut up i want to be mean and mad and angry oh i don't want any part of it when they changed presidents i didn't change i didn't have to say a new prayer in the morning i didn't have to say a new prayer at night i didn't have to go find a new bible i didn't say oh the holy spirit i had four years ago isn't the holy spirit i need today no no nothing's changed everything's on time god has everybody in their place within the whole world the world is doing what they're doing for us [Applause] they're the ones you know the next message in line is seed is not air with the shock they pull away from us they spill us out of their mouth they don't want no part of us we don't have any part in their political world we don't have any part in their social world we don't have any part in their what's politically correct what's socially correct what's the right way to think what do you what we teach what they teach in school we don't have no part of those things i'll tell you i don't care what they teach in school as long as you're teaching your kids the bible you're teaching them jesus christ you're teaching them the commandments of god but if you don't meet your responsibility then you'll never overcome this world it'll overcome you but the spirit is abides with us so it walks with us so like i said to the brother i said you know i look at my little grandson and i i think he's he's two uh he's gonna be two this coming uh october so he's just at that age you know and uh uh you know brother brown said in the tape today he said that well you know you take on the responsibility when you have those little children little hand prints on the wall well my uh i think that my my grandson has some great ability to do artwork he's an artist because he took the permanent marker and he drew a beautiful mozart or michelangelo painting on the uh on the hardwood floor matthew wants to know what removes it and i'm saying no you ought to frame it let's cut that out and put it on the wall knew what i was saying he finally says i'm sorry dad for all the walls i marked up all the floors yeah everything i did i i i i'm sorry for all those things but you want to know something because those children are eternal when it comes time that that word comes by them in their life that spirit will be there to quicken it and to cause them to accept it that's right now they may shirk that and run away from it but all they're doing is running down a hard road that's going to produce a lot of misery but let me tell you something he's not going to lose one of them [Applause] just the way it is i got advice for every teenager you want to drive obey mommy and daddy be good because they have the keys to the car peter had the keys to hell and death jesus had the keys to hell mom and dad he got the keys to the car so keep a right attitude keep a good spirit learn to say yes mom yes dad help carry out the trash help do all the good things because they got the keys to the car that's just some common sense that i threw in i don't have a scripture for it except for if you obey your parents you have a long life now i always took that as a threat that if i didn't obey them they may end my life earlier [Music] he said so the holy spirit are gained to the life in that legion as soon as he finds it it does like it did on jesus the great sun super god redeemed us it comes down and takes its place and abodes in the human life now notice brought brought the quickening power now this quickening power that came upon jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so it came on him to bring it to life so don't forget this it's the spirit that quickens but that spirit quickens in time and in season and in circumstances and in situations so it's not like you all of a sudden i have the spirit and now i'm just going to live my life just the way no that spirit's with you it walks with you and all of a sudden you come to a place in your life where you need to step higher you need to overcome you need a victory you didn't even know you needed that or all of a sudden the holy spirit comes and sprays the windex of god's word on the mirror and it wipes the mirror clean and you see yourself for what you really are and you go oh wow that's not what i was looking at but the spirits there to quicken the change to give that word that brought you under conviction to forgive that word life and wings to fly and to manifest it's not a one-time thing it's something that comes and i'll be with you even in you to the end i will lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness i will give you i sav when you need it i'll give you white remnant when you need it i'll give you gold trident fire when you need it so you can't perfect yourself but you've got a promise that i'll not leave you nor forsake you so you know that that power that you possess that life you possess that that life will quicken you and make that word alive in you when the hour and time comes and we'll close with this deceiving to manifest the promise the hour when it fell upon luther it manifests that promise of that hour luther never prayed for the sick the promise was there he was reading the same bible that we read but it never the spirit never brought that to life here was a guy that was lighting candles saying mass believed that he was changing the wafer into the literal body and blood of jesus he was sitting in his little box and people were telling their sins he thought he was forgiving their sins that was the condition he was in and one day he read the just shall live by faith he's got the revelation of justification what gave that luther was a a church age messenger he was a catholic priest but yet that's who he was and that spirit came and quickened that portion of the word that was for him it didn't quicken all the word it didn't quicken all the word for all the ages it didn't have them speak in tongues it didn't have them do anything it just quickened the allotted word for that hour the same spirit that quickened luther was the same spirit that quickened the resurrection but it only quickened to that power it said it manifest the hour and when it fell on wesley it manifested the promise of that hour and when it fell in this day it manifests the promise of this hour and when it fell on moses it manifested the power of that hour and when it fell upon noah it manifests the promise of that hour and when it fell on jesus it manifests the promise of that hour it's the holy scripture coming down to quicken make alive those people that are foreordained of god to be in the rapture hallelujah what's he quicken us for he's not quicking us for a new manifestation of works and gifts he's not putting the cry in you to overcome for any other reason than the rapture that's the promise that lies before us not another messenger not another works this is our easter we are easter it's here to quicken i'll tell you that's the resurrection i'm looking for it's the resurrection of the rapture i don't want to be resurrected back into this life no i'm looking for the quickening power that quickens our mortal body that's a promise of our hour that's the promise of our day it's looking to quicken for the rapture that is if that true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's that true eagle he who have ear to hear let him hear in other words the reason that you're not looking for another pentecost the reason you're not looking for the restoration of the gifts we're not looking for a power in this church to prove that he's resurrected we're looking for the power in the church that produces rapturing faith that was revealed that's what was hidden those thunders that's what they revealed in those seals we've got to know what it is that we're hungering for what it why we're calling for the overcoming power we're calling for the overcoming power because we want the spirit in our midst that'll rapture us that's what we're after that's what we want to demonstrate that's the good news the spirit is here it's a message that calls us out and prepares us for a rapture it's not a new intellectual path uh professor teaching of the bible because when this church leaves they'll go on praying for the sick they'll go on think that being saved and they will be saved here at the judgment yes i'm not living for the judgment that true eagle it just it just comes in there it says see he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life and shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from life unto death that's what we're possessing the works the miracles the deliverance those things are done by quickening and these things we will do if the spirit so permit but let us move on to perfection then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from mortality to immortality that's how you know that's the proof because that spirit's in you so you know what that spirit's to do it didn't just come to make you miracle wonders it came to change you from mortality to in mortality so let me say this again when the spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world when it comes upon you what is it it's the thought hallelujah my goodness we've we've always made it like a third person like an anointing when the quickening power comes on you or the holy spirit comes on you it is the thought that god had of you before the foundation of the world your theophany has found you [Music] when the spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential like if you ask me for an oak tree and i gave you an acorn now the life for the oak tree is in the acorn but you have to wait till it grows up i'm going to keep marching because it's growing up in me it's growing he's quickening me he's giving me a call to overcome the spirits coming now to vindicate and make that word alive i feel the pull hallelujah i got the potential in me and as the word starts coming as i start coming out of the storehouse the spirit's there to quicken it make it alive give me wings and pretty soon it's going to give me wings right on out of here but it's got to grow up so do we when you receive the holy spirit of god it's god potential waiting upon you that he that has already recognized you and you are sealed by the spirit of promise of god unto the body of christ and when god looks down at calvary and saw jesus dying he not only died for his bride the body which is in the word church the church that believes his word for the ages whether it's feet body head or whatever it is what was he waiting for he'd been waiting for everything to grow up so you have the spirit but we always teach you get the spirit it's all over you don't need nothing else no you still need revelation you still need to overcome but what's the spirit there to do it's to give the word life they overcame by the word of god and their testimony and then and this is as we finish he says it's christ who was bleeding and dying and god looking upon him saw his resurrection and the church raised with him on easter oh what a great finish work now i want you to get all of this together because i've got something here a little bit i want to say the lord willing notice it's the earnest or potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy ghost it's then dwelling in you the potential of it and you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection that's what's going on we are growing into the full resurrection he is here to quicken to us the word it's the spirit that quickens that word to you we we say oh i got a revelation oh i got a revelation well i read this the other day and i got it no sorry that's right you're as dumb as a block of wood the spirit quickened that chamber the spirit opened my eye the spirit gave me i saved you see the and what does he give that to you for so you can grow into the full resurrection let him have his perfect work yes amen let him have his perfect word you know you've got it you know he's there he will quicken it in time you do your responsible work you fulfill your responsibilities you live that life every day you apply that token in every day and believe me when the when the circumstance arises whatever it is for you to pray for the sick for you to lead somebody to christ the spirit will be there to quicken and bring that word to life in your life and give that word wings in your life that your life proves that he's resurrected and the same yesterday today and forever who don't get this quickening power in this great resurrection promise that god's given us mixed up with pentecost it's the growing life every fruit was in the seed every apple was in that seed of that apple tree but it had to grow in to the fruits aren't you thank you that he promised never to leave you nor forsake you amen lord richly bless you this great easter week and sunday's easter and we'll go on further out of this great message to easter seal but you know what's terrible is when we get expectations and we get a plan and we think god ought to be working a certain way and and and then you get disappointed because i thought i should be doing this by now and i thought i should be doing that by no no no if you're his you're doing exactly what he wants you to do you know brother brandon made a quote that it yeah i don't have a vocabulary i don't want to use the word haunt and i don't want to use the word bother but it's a quote i almost consider every day he said brother ben will raise a man up just to preach one sermon now i'm just hoping that sermon hadn't come yet you know but i'm in bad shape if it's already passed but it's it's the cause to make us think and remember he's the one that's in control the spirit found you you didn't find it you did not choose me i chose you and if i started to work and you i'll finish it to the end and when the holy spirit found you he took his abode and he was there to let you grow into the resurrection and he's been quickening the word to you he's been confronting you he's been changing you he's been dealing with your heart and is anybody the same that they were no praise god we're growing into the perfect resurrection i like that god bless you let's stand this evening i enjoyed the time of fellowship the evening just being able to be at home with our friends and and just fellowship on the word of god and have some light-hearted moments but don't be discouraged church everything's right on time if god wants you to do something different he's got the power to come into your life if he wants to teach you he'll teach you he's the great tutor and and we'll come into the great understanding of all the things we have to suffer brother billy if you could come and help us this evening amen have you felt maybe sometimes you get a little impatient with the lord don't amen be still and know that i'm god he promised he wouldn't leave us or forsake us he promised if he started the work he would finish it he promised he would lead us in all truth and all righteousness i think that is just we're just where he wants us to be let's bow our heads in a word of prayer to this evening don't you in your heart you just want to take a moment to bow your heart and your mind to the lord and say lord i love you thank you for reaching your hand down for me lord and even when i first heard your message and i believed it in my heart that holy spirit took its abode right then and it convicted me of sin lord when i realized that all that long hair i had down my neck and everything father was was not the way that i was to be it was that spirit that quickened that word and brought that word to pass in my life the first haircut that i got way back when i was a hippie it was the holy spirit cutting my hair lord when i threw out the things in my life and i applied the token it was that spirit that was abiding with me and walking with me that created me a conviction in my heart and gave me the grace to apply the token and throw those things out lord all through the years as i've grown and i've made mistakes and i failed it was your spirit that abiding spirit that brought me back that convicted me of sin opened my eyes to see the word and then brought it to life it was the spirit that quickened and made the promise alive lord you've been there all the time and or may you haven't left us you haven't forsaken us we're just in an hour lord now that there's a deep calling for us to come to higher ground there's a call within us for more of you father we wouldn't have that thirst father if there wasn't water to satisfy lord we wouldn't be have the desire to come up higher unless there was a hire to come to and nor let us not be discouraged but let us be encouraged father let us thank you when we see the imperfection because you have something for us to replace that imperfection lord we've as we confront this great move of your spirit lord we're praying now that every member of this local assembly father that more and more are added to the core group more and more are taking their position and their place in this body or that the life of the resurrection could show father not in the pulpit but in the people that men and women in their life will know that you gave us a promise that the works that you do we shall do also may that be quickened father may this church be able to prove what they're talking about lord we just are desiring to grow to that place and we know that we've got to get our personal lives in order we've got to make sure the church is in order lord we've got to not shrink our responsibility to deal with the things that confront us in the flesh and in the spirit but lord i know that the perfect resurrection's coming and that perfect body is being formed and we're being formed to the rapture i believe that with all my heart may we all take courage this evening in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you so much amen don't you love this message amen amen i don't know how many messages i've told you
