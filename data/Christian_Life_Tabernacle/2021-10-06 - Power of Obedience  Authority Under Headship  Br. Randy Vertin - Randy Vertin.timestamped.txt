[48:04] lives in my soul
[48:06] amen amen i'm a witness in order to be a
[48:09] witness you have to have a personal
[48:11] experience
[48:12] how many are a witness of the power of
[48:14] jesus christ to change a life
[48:17] amen
[48:19] there are some feelings

[48:37] cannot go
[48:40] [Music]
[48:42] oh there's just one thing
[48:47] oh that i'm sure off
[48:53] oh my god is real
[48:56] for i can feel
[48:58] him in my soul
[49:15] my god is real before he has washed and
[49:21] made me hold
[49:25] his love for me
[49:37] my god is real before i can feel him in
[49:43] my soul
[49:46] [Music]
[49:47] oh i cannot tell
[49:53] oh just how it felt
[49:57] [Music]

[50:04] sins away

[51:11] him in my soul
[51:17] amen praise the lord
[51:20] amen i'm a witness that god is real
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:27] i think we all have a testimony that at
[51:29] certain times in our lives we tried so
[51:31] many other things
[51:32] tried to figure things out on our own
[51:35] but one day god came along
[51:38] and the holy ghost came along
[51:41] and gave you a revelation gave you a
[51:42] rock to stand on that all the devils in
[51:45] hell can't move you from
[51:48] you know once you've seen something once
[51:49] you've truly seen something
[51:52] there's no devil in hell can convince
[51:54] you
[51:55] that there's anything different from
[51:57] what you've received
[51:59] this jesus said paul i believe it was
[52:01] paul he said he said what do you have
[52:03] that you did not receive
[52:05] well i've received something
[52:08] i've received a revelation
[52:10] i've received the baptism of the holy
[52:11] ghost i've received a life
[52:14] that is being expressed
[52:16] in this mortal flesh
[52:18] we've heard from the from the
[52:20] uh ministry here over the last month
[52:22] month and a half how that holy ghost
[52:24] will come down and even bring your
[52:26] mortal flesh into subjection to the word
[52:29] of god
[52:30] i'm a witness of that
[52:33] and it's when you least expect it so
[52:34] many times you struggle and you fight
[52:37] and you're trying by your own power and
[52:39] then as soon as you finally give up and
[52:40] say lord i just can't do it he says i
[52:43] know i've been waiting for you to come
[52:44] to that revelation for a long time
[52:46] and then he brings you up a little bit
[52:48] higher amen he said if you'll humble
[52:50] yourself you'll be exalted in due time
[52:54] in his time
[52:55] i believe the heart of every believer
[52:57] here is lord we want to be exalted with
[52:59] you not not in a fleshly way but we want
[53:01] to exalt the name of the lord jesus but
[53:04] there's what we you know he wants us to
[53:06] be humble before him he's got a you know
[53:08] the scripture says that jesus and i'm
[53:10] kind of getting ahead of myself but the
[53:11] scripture says that jesus learned
[53:13] obedience
[53:14] by the things that he suffered
[53:16] amen and sometimes we suffer
[53:18] way longer than we need to because we
[53:21] just haven't come to that place of
[53:22] obedience yet a full heart heart felt
[53:24] obedience amen so let's just turn into
[53:27] the word this evening to a couple
[53:29] scriptures here
[53:32] i'm really excited of what the lord
[53:34] jesus is doing
[53:36] because i it's near the rapture is near
[53:38] even at the door
[53:40] we know it's happening even all around
[53:41] us as we speak
[53:43] but i feel like the you know the the
[53:46] the consummation of all things the the
[53:49] the manifestation of the rapture and our
[53:51] mortal flesh of being changed in the
[53:52] moment of twinkling and eye is just so
[53:54] close
[53:55] at hand
[53:56] that if i could say it this way i could
[53:58] i feel like i can almost taste it
[54:00] you know i it's just seeing the
[54:02] condition of the world
[54:04] and then seeing
[54:05] what the lord's doing i can only speak
[54:07] for myself but i believe for other ones
[54:09] that have this testimony of what he's
[54:11] doing in the hearts of the believers
[54:13] there's a desperation
[54:15] and a hatred for this world not for the
[54:18] people so to speak but for the systems
[54:20] for the the the world order the cosmos
[54:23] that we've heard it called
[54:25] and it's just nothing but wickedness the
[54:27] scripture says about the days of noah's
[54:29] at the imagination of man's heart with
[54:31] nothing but wicked continually and
[54:34] we're a test if we could testify to that
[54:41] like i said this where we're kind of
[54:42] going old school tonight with the
[54:43] microphone
[54:44] i'm not used to maybe holding holding
[54:46] this but you just bear with me we're
[54:48] going to turn to a couple scriptures
[54:49] here second timothy chapter 3.
[54:53] and then from there
[54:58] if you want to have it ready we're going
[54:59] to go
[55:01] we'll get there by god's grace
[55:05] from there we're going to go to romans
[55:07] 6.
[55:21] how many beloved lord jesus
[55:27] the lord is bringing his bride
[55:29] into a perfect unity with him
[55:32] she's not going to be united with
[55:34] anything else but the word
[55:36] the perfect
[55:37] entire word
[55:39] she'll be she'll be unified to she can't
[55:41] unify with anything else
[55:43] forgive me i think my pages are kind of
[55:45] sticking here
[55:49] second timothy chapter 3
[55:52] and we'll read
[55:53] just the first few verses here
[55:56] and we'll read verses one through five
[55:59] this know also that in the last days
[56:01] perilous times shall come
[56:03] for men shall be lovers of their own
[56:05] selves covetous boasters proud
[56:07] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[56:10] unthankful unholy without natural
[56:13] affection truce breakers false accusers
[56:16] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[56:18] that are good
[56:19] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[56:22] pleasures more than lovers of god having
[56:25] a form of godliness but denying the
[56:27] power thereof from such turn away and
[56:30] then we're going to go to the book of
[56:32] romans chapter 6.
[56:37] just to kind of give a title and maybe
[56:38] kind of a subtitle
[56:42] the title i guess would be the power of
[56:44] obedience
[56:47] and then for a subtitle
[56:50] this would kind of be more i guess the
[56:51] general theme of what the lord has just
[56:53] been really pressing on my heart
[56:55] is
[56:56] authority under headship
[57:00] in uh romans chapter 6 verses uh 16
[57:04] through 18.
[57:07] and we'll get we can start at verse 15.
[57:10] he said what then shall we sin because
[57:12] we are
[57:13] not under the law but under grace god
[57:15] forbid
[57:16] know ye not that to whom you yield
[57:18] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[57:21] er to whom ye obey
[57:23] whether of sin unto death or of
[57:26] obedience unto righteousness
[57:28] but god be thanked that ye were the
[57:30] servants of sin but ye have obeyed from
[57:32] the heart that form of doctrine which
[57:35] was delivered you
[57:36] being then made free from sin you became
[57:39] the servants of righteousness amen let's
[57:42] just bow our heads heavenly father as
[57:44] we've just read your word lord
[57:47] lord we could say
[57:48] thousands of words in the flesh but lord
[57:51] just one word from you by your spirit
[57:53] lord god would be more to us than
[57:55] anything that we could receive of a man
[57:57] lord this evening father we just
[57:58] surrender ourselves to you father that
[58:00] the holy ghost may have preeminence lord
[58:02] preeminence
[58:04] in your people lord preeminence to make
[58:06] yourself known father we just pray right
[58:09] now that you'd be with us this evening
[58:10] bless your word and bless the hearers
[58:12] lord in the name of the lord jesus
[58:13] christ we pray amen amen you may be
[58:15] seated
[58:19] and we're going to just turn to one more
[58:21] scripture here as you're seated
[58:23] first samuel
[58:26] chapter 13.
[58:31] you know we're living
[58:34] in an age i would say of absolute
[58:36] rebellion
[58:39] you know and we see it everywhere but i
[58:41] i feel you know it we kind of see it
[58:43] most especially
[58:45] uh i feel like in the united states you
[58:47] know the you know the united states was
[58:49] born on rebellion
[58:51] rebelling against the king and all these
[58:53] things and we understand about laodicea
[58:55] that nature of laodicea and people's
[58:56] rights and
[58:58] you know and i've really had that on my
[59:00] heart so much lately and i know i
[59:02] preached it probably ad nauseam
[59:04] maybe tired of hearing it but that lamb
[59:07] nature that god is requiring of his
[59:09] people
[59:10] lays down its rights
[59:13] and
[59:14] you know whether that be
[59:15] to
[59:16] natural authority
[59:18] you know the scripture says that those
[59:20] that are not under the holy ghost they
[59:22] speak evil of dignities
[59:24] they they reject authority over them
[59:26] which the scripture says that whether we
[59:28] want to believe it or not the lord has
[59:29] set those things up for a purpose
[59:32] you know and we understand that we obey
[59:35] obey these things as far as the word
[59:36] will allow
[59:38] but
[59:38] there's such a there's such a spirit of
[59:40] rebellion
[59:42] but we find that even the lord jesus
[59:44] when he came on the scene
[59:46] the scripture says as a lamb was dumb
[59:48] before the sheer shearer so opened he
[59:50] not his mouth
[59:52] and don't we so many times in our flesh
[59:55] i just speak for myself i don't speak
[59:57] for anybody else but the nature at least
[1:00:00] of my flesh is you always want to have
[1:00:01] that last word
[1:00:02] you know i always got in trouble for
[1:00:04] that growing up was you get into an
[1:00:06] argument with the parents or something
[1:00:08] and you felt like you just had them
[1:00:10] right where you wanted them but then
[1:00:11] they pulled the parrot card and say you
[1:00:13] know what we're just going to stop this
[1:00:14] right here you go to your room or do
[1:00:15] whatever and then on the way out you
[1:00:17] just had to say one last thing to get in
[1:00:19] that's what my parents always told me
[1:00:20] they said you always got to have the
[1:00:21] last word
[1:00:23] and so many times in our flesh
[1:00:25] we don't realize that that's the spirit
[1:00:28] of balaam
[1:00:30] you know we even heard of it this sunday
[1:00:32] talking about that organizational spirit
[1:00:35] and see the lord will not be confined by
[1:00:39] man's ideas
[1:00:40] the holy ghost will not be caged in by
[1:00:43] traditions
[1:00:44] by doctrines that a pet doctrine that
[1:00:47] you hold whether it be in the word or
[1:00:48] not
[1:00:49] because we find that as it was when the
[1:00:52] lord jesus came on the scene
[1:00:54] when the pharisees and sadducees who had
[1:00:57] more of a claim to the word of god than
[1:00:59] anybody else they said we have moses we
[1:01:00] have the prophets we have the word in so
[1:01:03] much that we know the word we can tell
[1:01:05] you the word front to back up down left
[1:01:08] right forwards backwards upside down
[1:01:10] everything you could think of they knew
[1:01:11] the word in a carnal fashion
[1:01:14] but we find out that the lord jesus said
[1:01:17] you're just white and sepulchers
[1:01:19] having a form of godliness but you deny
[1:01:23] the transforming power of god to take
[1:01:26] your life and conform it to transform it
[1:01:30] what does the scripture say to be
[1:01:32] conformed not to the image of this world
[1:01:35] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:01:37] your mind into the image of the lord
[1:01:40] jesus christ and we know the lord jesus
[1:01:43] is nothing else but the word
[1:01:46] so it's not about conforming to what
[1:01:48] we'd call quote message doctrine because
[1:01:52] we've come to we if we're not careful
[1:01:54] we'll get caught into a pharisee's
[1:01:56] spirit
[1:01:58] where as long as we're coming into
[1:02:00] subjection with a church creed
[1:02:04] as long as we call it message
[1:02:06] it'll be okay
[1:02:08] but see the message is none other than
[1:02:10] christ
[1:02:12] revealed to the people
[1:02:14] and we had a prophet to come and not
[1:02:17] only show us in letter what that would
[1:02:20] be
[1:02:21] but to actually live it out before the
[1:02:24] people we were talking about that wave
[1:02:26] sheath if we understand what the wave
[1:02:28] sheath is we could take that life that
[1:02:31] was expressed through a prophet and
[1:02:34] showed that it wasn't a life of
[1:02:37] law
[1:02:38] as we so often like to do put us in a
[1:02:41] cage of well we must do this taste not
[1:02:43] you know touch not handle that all these
[1:02:45] things which those things are good
[1:02:48] touch not the unclean thing and i'll
[1:02:50] receive you
[1:02:51] but if your heart's not right
[1:02:54] see paul said in romans he said he said
[1:02:56] not that you've obeyed of a fashion
[1:02:59] because i told you but he said because
[1:03:02] you've obeyed from the heart that form
[1:03:05] of doctrine that was delivered unto you
[1:03:09] see we're talking about the power of
[1:03:12] obedience and that's where we want to
[1:03:13] kind of start so we find in first samuel
[1:03:16] chapter 13 we understand the story of
[1:03:19] saul saul
[1:03:21] the the way i think of saul saul is the
[1:03:23] embodiment of denomination
[1:03:26] because saul was the crux of a desire of
[1:03:31] man to have man headship over man
[1:03:35] and we see that's what the
[1:03:36] denominational spirit is brother branham
[1:03:39] talked about that nicolaitan spirit the
[1:03:41] deeds of the nicolaitans were what they
[1:03:43] started out by ranking one another oh
[1:03:46] you're this great preacher you're this
[1:03:48] great pastor you're this great brother
[1:03:50] you're this great believer what were
[1:03:52] they doing they're ranking one another
[1:03:54] paul said you compare one another to on
[1:03:57] another and you're comparing one with
[1:03:59] another he said that's not wise
[1:04:01] and there's been something on my heart
[1:04:03] so much lately is every time i see
[1:04:05] something about wisdom we start to
[1:04:08] realize there's a wise version
[1:04:10] and there's a foolish virgin
[1:04:12] so whenever i see something now and i
[1:04:14] see it's not wise i take special note to
[1:04:17] that
[1:04:18] i start to see lord am i doing one of
[1:04:20] these things am i comparing
[1:04:23] one to another trying to take one
[1:04:25] preacher over another one person over
[1:04:27] another one church over another one one
[1:04:30] thing over another what is it because it
[1:04:32] shows that there's something in you
[1:04:34] that's not fully obedient because it
[1:04:36] shows we see we're talking about all
[1:04:38] this comes under headship
[1:04:41] because whenever you start to rank men
[1:04:44] above man and put yourself under man
[1:04:47] you've eliminated the headship of the
[1:04:49] holy ghost for you
[1:04:51] that was the problem with the nicolaitan
[1:04:54] spirit was what was it conquered the
[1:04:57] laity it brought the laity into
[1:04:59] subjection not to the holy ghost but to
[1:05:03] a man-made priesthood again
[1:05:06] and that's why i so appreciate our
[1:05:08] pastor who can come up and say hey i'm
[1:05:11] going to preach but you take what i'm
[1:05:13] saying and bring it to the word bring it
[1:05:16] to the message and what let's search the
[1:05:19] thing out
[1:05:20] those of you might be like
[1:05:22] liked politics at one time remember what
[1:05:24] ronald reagan said he said trust but
[1:05:26] verify
[1:05:27] and that's what we do as christians
[1:05:29] because what did they do in ephesus they
[1:05:31] had a testimony that they hated the
[1:05:33] deeds of the nicolaitans and what did
[1:05:36] they do he said they tried those that
[1:05:38] said they were apostles and found out
[1:05:41] that they were liars why because what
[1:05:43] were they trying to do was subject
[1:05:45] men subject the people of god under a
[1:05:49] man-made headship
[1:05:52] and god will not accept it
[1:05:54] you could go back all the way to garden
[1:05:56] of eden
[1:05:58] cain wanted things his own way
[1:06:01] he became a god that's what our pastor
[1:06:04] even mentioned this sunday see we think
[1:06:06] of a denomination as a church group
[1:06:10] see we know better than that in the
[1:06:11] message
[1:06:12] that put a bishop a a state presbyter
[1:06:16] over the the message churches of texas
[1:06:19] we know better than that
[1:06:21] satan doesn't come that but what does he
[1:06:23] do he tries to make you a denomination
[1:06:25] unto yourself
[1:06:28] i'll believe my way
[1:06:30] and my way is better than everybody
[1:06:32] else's way
[1:06:34] oh why well i have and that's why even
[1:06:37] as a minister or especially probably
[1:06:40] even as a pastor it's so it's probably
[1:06:43] so difficult i'm not a pastor but as a
[1:06:45] pastor i can imagine it's so difficult
[1:06:47] because
[1:06:48] you want the people to follow you as you
[1:06:50] follow christ
[1:06:51] but there's such a fine line because if
[1:06:54] you go too far you set a person up as an
[1:06:56] idol
[1:06:58] and there will be nobody
[1:07:00] between jesus christ and his bride
[1:07:03] no pope no minister no pastor no bishop
[1:07:08] not even a prophet
[1:07:10] can be between christ and his bride
[1:07:13] it's got to be those two in a perfect
[1:07:16] unity
[1:07:20] but what happens is will be you'll
[1:07:22] become a denomination unto yourself and
[1:07:24] not know it
[1:07:25] because what happens is you cage the
[1:07:27] word of god by your own traditions
[1:07:30] well i've always done it this way well
[1:07:33] if your way's not in the word that
[1:07:35] doesn't mean it's wrong there's nothing
[1:07:37] wrong with having traditions
[1:07:39] and those in that sense there's nothing
[1:07:40] wrong but if you if you're not putting a
[1:07:43] comma at the end of your tradition
[1:07:46] and not allowing the spirit of god to
[1:07:48] move you
[1:07:49] when he desires to move you then you
[1:07:52] become a denomination unto yourself
[1:07:55] and god will not dwell with that
[1:07:58] he wants a bride that is totally
[1:08:00] submissive to his will and his will
[1:08:03] alone
[1:08:07] it's bride time
[1:08:09] i don't see that pridefully i say that
[1:08:11] isn't god is calling a people
[1:08:14] he's calling believers individually
[1:08:17] you can come to this church every single
[1:08:19] day every single service and still go to
[1:08:22] hell
[1:08:23] it doesn't matter if this church
[1:08:25] preaches the message it doesn't matter
[1:08:27] if this church preaches truth 365 days a
[1:08:31] year 24 7.
[1:08:33] if it's not accepted in your heart
[1:08:36] if you don't believe from the heart
[1:08:38] if you have not surrendered all that you
[1:08:41] are
[1:08:42] to him
[1:08:43] it will profit you nothing
[1:08:46] the pharisees were willing to sacrifice
[1:08:49] you don't think it was a sacrifice they
[1:08:51] had to live separate
[1:08:53] they didn't so much that if they touched
[1:08:54] an unclean thing or did a certain thing
[1:08:56] that could be stoned
[1:08:58] but they were willing to make that
[1:08:59] outward sacrifice not because they loved
[1:09:02] god
[1:09:03] but because they loved the praises of
[1:09:05] men that it afforded them
[1:09:10] and we've got to be so careful because
[1:09:11] that same spirit
[1:09:14] is moving within the message you say the
[1:09:16] message of course
[1:09:17] where else would it try to move and the
[1:09:20] worst thing is it's more subtle in this
[1:09:23] message
[1:09:25] than anywhere else
[1:09:27] because we've got so much truth
[1:09:29] because knowledge puffed up
[1:09:32] we've got all of it
[1:09:34] the mystery's revealed
[1:09:36] the word opened to us
[1:09:39] we could stand toe-to-toe with anybody
[1:09:42] by the revelation he's given and we can
[1:09:44] know that it's the truth but if we're
[1:09:46] not careful
[1:09:48] if we're not careful
[1:09:50] you'll go right on with it
[1:09:52] and you'll miss the whole thing
[1:09:54] because god is requiring truth on the
[1:09:56] inward parts
[1:09:58] it's not enough he wants obedience from
[1:10:00] the heart
[1:10:02] it's it's easy to come to a mental
[1:10:04] recognition
[1:10:06] of many things even in this message to a
[1:10:09] point
[1:10:10] you say how can that be true well you
[1:10:12] see we we've we've forgotten the
[1:10:14] scripture that says the the devils
[1:10:16] believe
[1:10:17] and they tremble
[1:10:19] that's not exclusive to everything
[1:10:20] except the message
[1:10:22] if anything the devils believe this
[1:10:23] message more than anything because they
[1:10:25] saw the proof of what this produces by a
[1:10:29] prophet ministry
[1:10:30] so they know what this message produces
[1:10:34] they believe it probably more than a lot
[1:10:36] of people
[1:10:37] but they cannot come into subjection to
[1:10:40] it
[1:10:40] just like cain who was off the wicked
[1:10:43] one why because he could not come into a
[1:10:46] heartfelt subjection to the word of god
[1:10:49] though it was plainly revealed to him
[1:10:54] made plain to him
[1:10:56] if thou do as well
[1:10:58] you'll be accepted
[1:11:01] and i will even exalt you above your
[1:11:02] brother because you were firstborn
[1:11:04] and he couldn't do it why because the
[1:11:06] seed wouldn't allow it
[1:11:08] but thank the lord we've obeyed from the
[1:11:10] heart we've obeyed from the heart that
[1:11:13] form of doctrine that was delivered to
[1:11:15] us
[1:11:17] but we understand saul was a embodiment
[1:11:21] of the denominational idea
[1:11:23] we want a man to go before us we don't
[1:11:26] want the whole the word remember a
[1:11:28] prophet in the in the scripture type is
[1:11:30] the word types the word we don't want
[1:11:32] the word to go before us but we want to
[1:11:35] have a man something we can see with our
[1:11:37] eyes
[1:11:38] something we can handle something carnal
[1:11:41] something that i can hold on to
[1:11:44] something that i can do something that
[1:11:46] we can accomplish that i say i had my
[1:11:48] hand in it but you see when it comes
[1:11:50] down to it if we can receive real grace
[1:11:54] it's when we realized that we had no
[1:11:56] part in it that it had nothing to do
[1:11:58] with us
[1:11:59] by the grace of god he dropped down
[1:12:02] because he knew in your heart that you
[1:12:05] would choose him and he came and for
[1:12:07] ordained you to live this word it didn't
[1:12:10] have anything to do with your ability in
[1:12:12] fact most of us are probably if you
[1:12:14] compared us to many denominations we're
[1:12:17] weaker carnally
[1:12:19] brother branham said in the church age
[1:12:21] book he said the false will outshine the
[1:12:24] true in works and zeal
[1:12:28] so you start looking on the outward
[1:12:30] remember he told samuel god doesn't look
[1:12:32] on the outward but he looks on the
[1:12:34] inward man
[1:12:38] so what happened to saul
[1:12:40] they bring him up there the lord tells
[1:12:41] them
[1:12:42] they haven't rejected you samuel they
[1:12:44] rejected me
[1:12:46] and that's what you do when you accept
[1:12:47] the denominational spirit
[1:12:49] when you accept a man to tell you what
[1:12:51] to do instead of the holy ghost
[1:12:56] instead of the word
[1:13:00] then
[1:13:01] you got to be real careful
[1:13:03] but first samuel 13 and 14 he said
[1:13:07] now we understand
[1:13:08] saul what did he do
[1:13:11] samuel tells him the word tells him
[1:13:13] terry here i will come at the appointed
[1:13:16] time
[1:13:17] and then we shall do our service unto
[1:13:18] the lord we'll offer the sacrifice
[1:13:20] but what do the denominations do that
[1:13:23] denominational spirit will always force
[1:13:26] thing i don't have the quotes with me
[1:13:27] right now because i didn't have those in
[1:13:29] this one but you can find it in place
[1:13:31] after place brother brown talks about
[1:13:33] what happens is they get ahead of the
[1:13:35] word
[1:13:36] they're not willing to wait on the word
[1:13:39] of god
[1:13:40] just like eve in the garden if she would
[1:13:42] have just waited for the word to be made
[1:13:45] manifested how does god make his word
[1:13:48] manifest by bringing it to pass if she
[1:13:51] would have waited she would have seen
[1:13:53] the glory of god and the word performed
[1:13:55] the way he desired it but because she
[1:13:58] got ahead of it she accepted if i could
[1:14:01] say a beast religion and that's what a
[1:14:03] denominational spirit is is a beast made
[1:14:06] religion
[1:14:08] why because all denominations are going
[1:14:10] to join back up with the beast
[1:14:12] they go right back to mama
[1:14:15] every single time that spirit will unite
[1:14:18] against the word you say that can't be
[1:14:20] true look at the days of jesus when he
[1:14:23] gave the very word made flesh came on
[1:14:26] the scene
[1:14:28] and there were pharisees and sadducees
[1:14:30] who were so proud that they were the
[1:14:32] separated people of jehovah
[1:14:36] but that denominational spirit that they
[1:14:39] held so hated the word that it joined
[1:14:43] with rome
[1:14:44] it joined with rome who is rome she
[1:14:47] joined with the beast
[1:14:51] and so much
[1:14:52] that pilate
[1:14:53] said don't you want your king
[1:14:55] even rome
[1:14:57] tried to give him the king
[1:14:59] the lord jesus
[1:15:00] and they saw that denominational spirit
[1:15:03] so anointed said we have no king but
[1:15:06] caesar
[1:15:08] we accept rome we'll take her away
[1:15:11] that's what they'll do every single time
[1:15:14] because they cannot subject themselves
[1:15:17] to the word they can't humble themselves
[1:15:20] because they got it all
[1:15:21] but they've denominated what do they do
[1:15:23] they caged their they've you've taken
[1:15:25] the traditions of man and you've made
[1:15:27] the word of god of none effect
[1:15:29] because you said we can only go this far
[1:15:32] that's it
[1:15:33] and then lord says well i'm going over
[1:15:34] here
[1:15:36] well i can't go there my creed won't let
[1:15:38] me
[1:15:39] my doctrine won't let me
[1:15:42] and then you're dead
[1:15:44] there's a reason why brother branham
[1:15:47] hammered denomination
[1:15:49] from beginning to end beginning to end
[1:15:53] over and over and over because it's a
[1:15:56] spirit
[1:15:57] that was started in heaven
[1:16:00] satan started the first denomination
[1:16:03] he said i will be like the most high
[1:16:06] there's a new revelation for you i'm
[1:16:08] gonna be like the most high and a third
[1:16:11] of the angels followed him
[1:16:13] there's your denominational spirit he
[1:16:15] brought that right down to eve
[1:16:19] didn't he
[1:16:20] said you'll be his gods you'll be like
[1:16:22] the most high
[1:16:24] knowing good and evil
[1:16:26] there's your denominational spirit again
[1:16:28] and it keeps going and it keeps going
[1:16:31] here goes saul remember saul he had the
[1:16:34] word
[1:16:35] the word told him to terry here
[1:16:38] terry here stay here
[1:16:41] until i come
[1:16:43] sounds a little bit like terry in the
[1:16:45] city of jerusalem until you be endued
[1:16:47] with power from on high
[1:16:49] that's why stephen could say to those
[1:16:51] stiff-necked pharisees
[1:16:53] you always do resist the holy ghost
[1:16:58] who is the word
[1:17:00] you resist the word when the word comes
[1:17:02] to you
[1:17:03] you cannot accept it
[1:17:05] you'll go so far
[1:17:07] they'll be like a judas i'll walk with
[1:17:10] it for a while but when it comes down to
[1:17:12] lay it all down
[1:17:14] can't do it cain manifests himself that
[1:17:18] denominational nickelodeon spirit
[1:17:20] manifests itself he can't do it
[1:17:22] and so saul had it too he couldn't wait
[1:17:26] and he said
[1:17:29] first samuel
[1:17:31] 13
[1:17:32] saw samuel tells him he says but now thy
[1:17:34] kingdom shall not continue
[1:17:36] the lord hath sought him a man after his
[1:17:39] own heart
[1:17:40] see there it is after his own heart
[1:17:43] there's the difference
[1:17:44] saul looked great head and shoulders
[1:17:46] above every man
[1:17:48] saul had the anointing on him
[1:17:51] remember after samuel anointed saul he
[1:17:53] said this and this and this is going to
[1:17:54] happen and he goes down and the spirit
[1:17:57] falls upon him in so much he started
[1:17:58] prophesying with the prophets the
[1:18:00] scripture says there was a saying that
[1:18:01] went forth that said it's not saul among
[1:18:03] the prophets he was a pentecostal
[1:18:07] had the spirit anointing
[1:18:09] but he couldn't accept the word
[1:18:13] when the word told him what to do he
[1:18:14] couldn't do it
[1:18:17] the lord had sought of a man after his
[1:18:19] own heart and the lord hath commanded
[1:18:21] him to be captain over his people
[1:18:23] because thou hast not kept that which
[1:18:25] the lord hath com which the lord
[1:18:28] commanded thee
[1:18:29] oh my
[1:18:31] first samuel 15 22
[1:18:33] samuel said samuel said hath the lord as
[1:18:37] great delight in burnt offerings and
[1:18:39] sacrifices
[1:18:40] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:18:44] remember it doesn't matter how much you
[1:18:45] can do
[1:18:46] when the word comes to you
[1:18:48] you obey
[1:18:50] you fulfill the word of god
[1:18:53] you submit unto the headship of the word
[1:18:56] that's the spirit of the bride she
[1:18:58] submits now you can't do it yourself
[1:19:02] that's the whole point you say well i
[1:19:04] can't seem to get past this flesh well
[1:19:06] let the holy ghost take over your life
[1:19:08] one time and see if all those things
[1:19:10] just don't start dying away
[1:19:12] why because it's only by his spirit
[1:19:15] church age book we know the quote if we
[1:19:18] can
[1:19:19] recognize the two spirits in the
[1:19:20] framework of the church and by his
[1:19:22] spirit
[1:19:23] withstand the antichrist spirit by whose
[1:19:27] spirit his spirit by the holy ghost by
[1:19:30] the spirit of god that dwelleth in you
[1:19:32] if the same spirit that raised christ up
[1:19:34] from the dead dwell in you it shall also
[1:19:37] quicken your mortal bodies so what will
[1:19:40] it do it will make you alive to the word
[1:19:43] dead to the world
[1:19:50] has the lord as great delight and burnt
[1:19:52] offerings and sacrifices has been
[1:19:54] obeying the voice of the lord behold to
[1:19:56] obey is better than sacrifice and to
[1:19:59] hearken than the fat of rams for
[1:20:02] rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:20:04] listen how powerful this is
[1:20:06] rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:20:09] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:20:11] idolatry
[1:20:13] you say that's rough but you see it
[1:20:15] manifested because at the end of saul's
[1:20:17] life where did he go he went to the
[1:20:19] witch
[1:20:20] he went to the witchcraft who's the
[1:20:22] witch that's the catholic church
[1:20:25] there's the denomination
[1:20:26] joining with the catholic church
[1:20:28] because why he wanted to find the word
[1:20:31] and when he found samuel he brought him
[1:20:33] up samuel said the word's already gone
[1:20:36] i've moved on
[1:20:38] and he had to die
[1:20:40] see what that
[1:20:41] spirit that denominational spirit will
[1:20:42] get you
[1:20:44] that's why all of those
[1:20:46] the the daughters of the harlot mother
[1:20:48] of harlot they'll join right back with
[1:20:50] her because they're of the same spirit
[1:20:52] did not brother branham in his preview
[1:20:54] of the bride
[1:20:56] what did he see he saw that first bride
[1:20:59] going forth and then he sat there and
[1:21:00] watched all the different ones he said
[1:21:02] through the church ages coming through
[1:21:04] coming through until it got to the last
[1:21:06] one he said it was the most vilest
[1:21:07] disgusting looking thing he ever seen
[1:21:09] blind miserable wretched naked poor
[1:21:12] didn't know it right dancing to rock and
[1:21:14] roll if that's not a pentecostal spirit
[1:21:17] i don't know what is
[1:21:18] brother branham said in a couple of
[1:21:20] places he said at the pentecostal church
[1:21:22] where the last two thousand years it'll
[1:21:24] be far beyond what the catholic church
[1:21:26] is and i can testify to that having seen
[1:21:28] it
[1:21:30] at least catholic church
[1:21:32] if i could say anything about it at
[1:21:33] least it clings to what it had
[1:21:36] the pentecostal church since the lord
[1:21:38] called me out of it back in 2002
[1:21:41] they have more tattoos than biker gang's
[1:21:43] got
[1:21:45] they do and they call it god
[1:21:48] and it's the devil
[1:21:50] but what was she doing she was dancing
[1:21:52] to that rock and roll that was that
[1:21:53] layout to see in church right but who
[1:21:55] was she led by she was led by the witch
[1:21:58] there's your two coming together again
[1:22:00] they'll always come together why because
[1:22:02] as the mother is so is the daughter
[1:22:07] but god's seeking someone after his own
[1:22:10] heart
[1:22:11] oh yeah you're gonna make mistakes david
[1:22:13] made mistakes but he was a man after
[1:22:15] god's own heart
[1:22:17] you're gonna make mistakes
[1:22:19] but you get down and make your calling
[1:22:20] and election sure you say lord burn
[1:22:23] every worldly lust out of me lord take
[1:22:25] every worldly desire out of me just
[1:22:28] baptize me with the holy ghost baptism
[1:22:30] after baptism after baptism boiling all
[1:22:33] the trash out
[1:22:34] that's the revival we're looking for
[1:22:36] it's to get us to a place of desperation
[1:22:39] to realize that our life that we're
[1:22:41] living is not up to the standard of the
[1:22:43] word
[1:22:47] the closer you get to him the more all
[1:22:50] the little things that you let go become
[1:22:53] worse in his sight
[1:22:54] when you start to see with his eyes you
[1:22:56] start to see just how if angels are
[1:22:59] filthy in his sight
[1:23:01] but praise be to god that the blood of
[1:23:03] jesus christ cleanses us beyond all of
[1:23:06] that
[1:23:09] thank you lord jesus
[1:23:11] that's where the salvation lies it that
[1:23:13] the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:15] collected you so far
[1:23:18] the angels are filthy in his sight but
[1:23:20] he looks at you and can't see nothing
[1:23:22] praise the lord
[1:23:25] so clean and spotless and virtuous
[1:23:29] because you obeyed from the heart
[1:23:31] because you're coming under headship
[1:23:34] we've got to come under complete
[1:23:37] headship to the word there's nothing
[1:23:39] else that it can be
[1:23:40] so i looked up the the meaning of the
[1:23:42] word obedience
[1:23:44] and there's a couple of things here it
[1:23:46] says compliance with an order request or
[1:23:49] law
[1:23:50] we understand that someone tells you to
[1:23:51] do something and you do it you've obeyed
[1:23:53] what they told you to do right that's
[1:23:54] really simple see god also requires that
[1:23:57] from us repent and be baptized in the
[1:23:59] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:24:01] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:24:02] gift of the holy ghost you repent you
[1:24:04] you obey from the heart
[1:24:06] this word
[1:24:08] and you do what is required of you
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:15] not all that said unto me lord lord
[1:24:16] shall enter in but they that doeth the
[1:24:18] will of my father
[1:24:20] and the only thing that can do the will
[1:24:22] of the father
[1:24:23] is the holy ghost
[1:24:25] it's the holy ghost it's the only thing
[1:24:27] that can do it
[1:24:28] it's the word is the only thing that can
[1:24:30] fulfill the word is the word the
[1:24:32] ticket's got to match up that chinese
[1:24:34] laundry ticket's got to match up and it
[1:24:36] wanted to do it proved that they were
[1:24:38] the same substance to begin with
[1:24:41] what did we hear on wednesday that's the
[1:24:44] truth
[1:24:45] that you are the very feminine part of
[1:24:47] god made manifest in the flesh
[1:24:52] god
[1:24:53] separated you
[1:24:55] out of jesus on the cross he put
[1:24:57] the second adam to sleep
[1:25:00] just like the garden and while he was
[1:25:02] asleep he pulled you out
[1:25:04] so you could be manifest but praise be
[1:25:06] to god we're not gonna be like that
[1:25:08] first eve
[1:25:09] why because because unlike the first eve
[1:25:12] she was in the garden i've always
[1:25:13] wondered this and if you found quotes on
[1:25:15] it you let me know i've never been able
[1:25:17] to find it but i've always wondered
[1:25:18] where was adam
[1:25:20] when that serpent was coming walking
[1:25:22] around
[1:25:25] why she wasn't under she wasn't with the
[1:25:27] headship
[1:25:28] as far as i can tell i may be wrong but
[1:25:31] i tell you one thing it won't be so in
[1:25:33] this day because in this day there's a
[1:25:35] uniting time that's come where the bride
[1:25:38] and christ are one and they're gonna be
[1:25:40] so close together inseparable just like
[1:25:43] what they say the pyramid is so close
[1:25:45] you can't even fit a razor blade between
[1:25:46] the stones sealed in there with the
[1:25:48] cement that's lasted for six thousand
[1:25:50] years
[1:25:51] can't touch
[1:25:52] it and what is it we're lively stones
[1:25:55] fitted and joined together so tight and
[1:25:57] compacted together there's nothing can
[1:25:59] get between it
[1:26:01] and there is nothing going to separate
[1:26:04] what shall separate us from the love of
[1:26:05] christ
[1:26:06] shall tribulation or famine or nakedness
[1:26:08] or peril or sword or all these things no
[1:26:11] no why because we've united with him at
[1:26:13] that day you shall know that i am in the
[1:26:15] father and the father is in me and i am
[1:26:18] in you
[1:26:19] so what is it they've become we've
[1:26:20] become so united with him and our minds
[1:26:23] are his minds his thoughts are our
[1:26:26] thoughts our desires is his desires so
[1:26:28] when that little devil comes sneaking
[1:26:30] around again in this day
[1:26:32] we're gonna stand with our husband on
[1:26:34] that word and say i don't think so devil
[1:26:37] you got her in the garden of eden you
[1:26:39] got her back in ephesus but you are not
[1:26:42] getting here on mount zion
[1:26:45] praise the lord
[1:26:47] why because he promised it
[1:26:49] he promised it he said he'll cut the
[1:26:51] work short in righteousness he's going
[1:26:54] to take us out of here he's going to
[1:26:56] seal us so full of his spirit so he
[1:26:59] can't get in there the only way he can
[1:27:00] get in is if you go out
[1:27:03] so stay in
[1:27:05] stay in
[1:27:06] every day
[1:27:07] be baptized with the spirit be dead to
[1:27:10] yourself be dead to your creeds be dead
[1:27:13] to your ideas be dead to your message
[1:27:16] dogmas it doesn't matter if it doesn't
[1:27:18] toad up to the word it doesn't matter
[1:27:31] there's a time
[1:27:33] where we're coming under headship
[1:27:36] you know obedience is a powerful thing
[1:27:38] when the lord gives
[1:27:40] something to do and you obey
[1:27:42] you find out that the lord comes on the
[1:27:44] scene and fulfills exactly what he said
[1:27:45] he would do
[1:27:47] you know we could take a lot of examples
[1:27:49] of that i'll just take a couple we know
[1:27:50] the story of jericho
[1:27:53] the lord tells joshua you're going to go
[1:27:54] around the city compass the city seven
[1:27:56] times and on the seventh day seven more
[1:27:57] times you're not going to speak you're
[1:27:59] going to blow a trumpet on the last time
[1:28:00] you're going to shout and blow the
[1:28:01] trumpet into the walls are going to come
[1:28:02] down was there any virtue in the
[1:28:05] marching
[1:28:06] was there any virtue in the trumpet
[1:28:08] sounding was there any virtue in the
[1:28:11] shouting when the wall came down no but
[1:28:14] the virtue came because of obedience to
[1:28:17] the word
[1:28:18] when you obey the word god comes on the
[1:28:21] scene and confirms it
[1:28:24] think about naaman
[1:28:25] remember name it he goes has leprosy and
[1:28:28] he wants to be cured he hears there's a
[1:28:30] prophet in israel and goes to the king
[1:28:33] and the king says what have you done to
[1:28:35] me i can't heal the man
[1:28:37] and they bring him to the prophet
[1:28:39] and he doesn't and the prophet doesn't
[1:28:41] even see god's not a respecter of
[1:28:42] persons
[1:28:44] because the prophet didn't even see name
[1:28:45] in face to face he sends out his servant
[1:28:50] he says i don't even need to see him the
[1:28:51] lord's already told me
[1:28:52] go tell him to dip seven times in jordan
[1:28:54] he'll be clean the scripture says that
[1:28:56] naaman was in a fury
[1:28:59] he was mad he was hot
[1:29:02] why because he had a denominational
[1:29:04] spirit
[1:29:05] he had in his mind already figured out
[1:29:08] how everything was going to go down
[1:29:11] why because he said it from his own
[1:29:12] mouth he said i thought surely that the
[1:29:15] man would come forth and strike his hand
[1:29:16] over the place or do such and such a
[1:29:18] thing and it took the servant to plead
[1:29:21] with him and he goes are not all these
[1:29:23] rivers
[1:29:24] even greater than the jordan they give
[1:29:26] me the muddy old jordan yeah death to
[1:29:28] self is an ugly thing
[1:29:30] dying to yourself is not enjoyable dying
[1:29:33] to yourself is not fun
[1:29:35] dying to yourself is something that
[1:29:37] takes you must die daily and believe you
[1:29:40] me this flesh doesn't like to die
[1:29:44] watch an animal when you go to kill it
[1:29:46] and watch how it struggles for life so
[1:29:49] is the flesh you get down to pray in the
[1:29:51] morning and all of a sudden your
[1:29:52] shopping list is in your mind what you
[1:29:54] got to do after work's on your mind
[1:29:56] you're sitting here in service right now
[1:29:58] wondering when brother's going to be
[1:29:59] done preaching because i'm hungry and my
[1:30:01] crockpot's going to boil over that's how
[1:30:03] the devil gets you the battle's up here
[1:30:06] brothers and sisters but if you can get
[1:30:08] beyond that then you can get down into
[1:30:10] your heart and you can say lord there
[1:30:12] has been something change in me that i
[1:30:14] don't know how it's going to happen i
[1:30:16] don't know why you even chose me i know
[1:30:18] i'm not worthy but there's something in
[1:30:20] my heart that can't be satisfied until i
[1:30:23] see jesus christ manifested in this body
[1:30:29] why because the scripture says as he is
[1:30:31] so are we in the world we heard our
[1:30:33] pastor mention it again on sunday why
[1:30:36] because any spirit that does not say
[1:30:38] jesus christ is come in the flesh
[1:30:41] we're not talking about a corporal body
[1:30:43] with pierced hands
[1:30:44] and feet
[1:30:46] that you can touch no he's talking about
[1:30:47] you
[1:30:48] if you can receive it
[1:30:50] he's talking about you
[1:30:52] and see so that's why i can tell you
[1:30:54] whenever that devil comes and say oh
[1:30:56] jesus christ doesn't live in you
[1:30:58] well then you automatically know that
[1:30:59] that's a devil spirit because it says
[1:31:01] whatever spirit does not confess that
[1:31:02] jesus christ has come into the flesh is
[1:31:04] not of god
[1:31:05] see how simple the word is but if but
[1:31:08] our minds our laodicean minds want to
[1:31:10] make everything complicated oh man we
[1:31:13] love complicated things
[1:31:14] my wife bought me this nice tablet right
[1:31:17] because i just something a little bit
[1:31:18] smaller but how to carry around like
[1:31:21] instead of a big laptop that i had but
[1:31:23] oh my goodness it's so complicated all
[1:31:25] the buttons and the touches and the
[1:31:26] gestures and the things that you can do
[1:31:28] and the 5 trillion font sizes and the
[1:31:30] different what is it it's overwhelming
[1:31:33] the people
[1:31:35] it's trying to take the minds of the
[1:31:36] people and so
[1:31:38] scramble them up in the mental in the
[1:31:40] spirit realm that you can never break
[1:31:42] past that to see him
[1:31:44] but if you could just simplify yourself
[1:31:47] be simple there
[1:31:49] there's no great ones among us
[1:31:52] if anybody thinks he's a great one
[1:31:54] well then serve
[1:31:57] the greatest among you would serve
[1:32:00] so
[1:32:01] you know what you know that's what
[1:32:02] that's humility that's humbleness
[1:32:04] because that haughty remember the
[1:32:06] scripture says that the daughters of
[1:32:07] zion would get haughty
[1:32:10] and we heard that in ii timothy there be
[1:32:12] heady high-minded lovers of pleasures
[1:32:13] more than lovers of god so are many of
[1:32:15] the so-called daughters of zion
[1:32:18] oh well i'm just i'm the bee's knees as
[1:32:20] they say i'm the cream of the crop i'm
[1:32:22] the bride but i tell you what the
[1:32:24] scripture says that they were called
[1:32:26] christians at antioch they didn't have
[1:32:28] to profess their christianity
[1:32:30] the very life that lived in them
[1:32:32] testified to who they were and brother
[1:32:34] branham even goes so far as to tell us a
[1:32:36] little parable of the slave
[1:32:38] that was brought in from another kingdom
[1:32:40] who had such a life and a revelation
[1:32:42] about his identity that's what that was
[1:32:44] about was identity who you are he had
[1:32:47] such an identity about him he didn't
[1:32:49] have to walk around say oh i'm the king
[1:32:51] of this tribe no he had such a life
[1:32:54] about him
[1:32:56] an atmosphere and an expression of life
[1:32:59] in him
[1:33:00] that the slave masters inquired about
[1:33:04] the past of this guy
[1:33:06] say what in the world is causing him to
[1:33:08] live that way
[1:33:10] that's the kind of life i wanted me
[1:33:12] that's the kind of life that is in me i
[1:33:14] just need to die more to let him
[1:33:15] manifest it more the only thing standing
[1:33:18] between you and god is you
[1:33:21] it's you dying
[1:33:22] my greatest opponent is me why well i
[1:33:25] said brother what about the devil the
[1:33:26] devil's already defeated
[1:33:29] he's already under my feet
[1:33:31] he's done
[1:33:33] the lord jesus conquered that
[1:33:35] now he wants to conquer you
[1:33:38] he wants you to be conquered he wants
[1:33:40] your ideas to be conquered he wants your
[1:33:42] ambitions to be conquered you don't
[1:33:44] think paul had a struggle knowing that
[1:33:47] he was in line to be head of the
[1:33:49] pharisees
[1:33:50] and then you know how many i guarantee
[1:33:52] the devil put it on there because he
[1:33:54] even paul had to bring it out he said i
[1:33:55] was a pharisee of pharisees i was at the
[1:33:57] stock of the tribe of benjamin
[1:33:59] circumcised the eighth day concerning
[1:34:01] the law blameless what was he showing he
[1:34:03] was showing he said i counted all dumb
[1:34:06] that i may win christ
[1:34:08] see moses could you imagine moses
[1:34:13] you know the lord gave me just this
[1:34:14] little tidbit thought you know and then
[1:34:16] carnal
[1:34:17] wouldn't it have made carnal sense for
[1:34:19] moses to have just sat there on the
[1:34:21] throne
[1:34:22] and then say i'll just wait for old man
[1:34:23] pharaoh to croak
[1:34:25] forgive me for being crude but
[1:34:28] i'll just wait for pharaoh to die and
[1:34:29] when i sin to the throne let my people
[1:34:31] go because they're now my people
[1:34:34] but see god
[1:34:36] loves a paradox
[1:34:38] he said i've taken the the foolish
[1:34:40] things of this world to confound the
[1:34:42] wise i've taken the base things of this
[1:34:45] world to exalt them to a higher place
[1:34:47] i've uh there's nothing of me
[1:34:50] i'm a fool
[1:34:52] there of myself i can't do anything
[1:34:55] jesus christ said without me ye can do
[1:34:58] nothing
[1:34:59] but with me you can do all things
[1:35:01] and then paul comes along and echoes the
[1:35:03] same thing he said i can do all things
[1:35:04] through christ for strengtheneth me
[1:35:06] has nothing to do with himself nothing
[1:35:08] to do with his abilities
[1:35:10] you think this is me
[1:35:12] speaking to you this isn't anything on
[1:35:15] my notes this is inspiration from the
[1:35:17] lord i'm not saying that to magnify
[1:35:19] myself
[1:35:20] the point is if you don't have a
[1:35:22] revelation of the word of god and how he
[1:35:24] moves you will become a denomination
[1:35:26] unto yourself because you'll look at the
[1:35:30] pastor or the preacher any anybody who
[1:35:32] would be up here
[1:35:33] that would be ministering to you and
[1:35:34] you'll judge them based on the vessel
[1:35:37] but you know paul said
[1:35:39] he said he said whether they preach of
[1:35:41] their own selfish reasons for their own
[1:35:43] gain or they preach out of pureness of
[1:35:45] heart he said at least the gospel's
[1:35:47] preached why because even our prophet
[1:35:50] taught us that even if it's in the
[1:35:51] handyard the hen house and eagle egg can
[1:35:54] hatch
[1:35:55] because it's about that atmosphere it's
[1:35:56] about the seed that went in
[1:35:58] so we judged so many things on the
[1:36:00] appearance so did samuel said don't look
[1:36:03] upon him because of his great stature
[1:36:05] and his great ability and his great
[1:36:06] build he's i almost think the lord might
[1:36:08] have told samuel didn't i teach you the
[1:36:10] first time with saul
[1:36:13] because what happened he brought up the
[1:36:14] sons of jesse and he saw the first one
[1:36:15] and the lord i did tell him again don't
[1:36:17] look on the stature of him carnally
[1:36:19] god judges the heart
[1:36:21] god's looking on the and that's what the
[1:36:23] world says right but they use it in a
[1:36:24] perverse way you bring the word to them
[1:36:26] you show them straight out of the word
[1:36:29] something as simple as baptism in the
[1:36:30] name of jesus christ they say oh well
[1:36:32] you know it doesn't really matter god
[1:36:34] knows my heart oh yeah he does and he
[1:36:36] knows that he don't care oh he
[1:36:38] absolutely knows your heart
[1:36:41] absolutely he knows your heart
[1:36:44] and he knows you don't care
[1:36:47] not you but you know what i'm talking
[1:36:48] about
[1:36:53] we're gonna close you i'm not even gonna
[1:36:54] get to where i was gonna go but we're
[1:36:56] gonna close here in just a minute
[1:36:58] so
[1:37:00] so i just read this a couple quotes here
[1:37:03] one from blind bartimaeus it's just kind
[1:37:04] of talking about that power of
[1:37:06] so we we kind of got off on naaman but
[1:37:08] naaman ran off in a fury and his servant
[1:37:11] had to tell him if he would have told
[1:37:12] you some great thing if he would have
[1:37:14] told you to backflip 15 times jump off a
[1:37:16] hundred foot cliff into a pool of water
[1:37:18] the size of a thimble you would have
[1:37:19] done it
[1:37:20] but he's simply telling you to do this
[1:37:23] and be clean
[1:37:24] and naaman came to his senses and he
[1:37:26] became clean but what was it it wasn't
[1:37:28] it wasn't the river that had the power
[1:37:30] it wasn't anything else but the
[1:37:32] obedience to the word and when you
[1:37:34] submit yourself to the word
[1:37:37] when you come under that headship
[1:37:39] that's where the power lays
[1:37:41] brother branham says in blind bottom
[1:37:42] master in 1954 he said just like the
[1:37:44] brass serpent why the serpent didn't
[1:37:46] have no virtue in it it was a piece of
[1:37:47] brass they brought up brought it up out
[1:37:49] of egypt neither did the pole have any
[1:37:51] virtue in it not a bit but it was
[1:37:53] obeying what god said do what brought
[1:37:55] the power what brought the virtue is
[1:37:58] obedience to the word of god and that's
[1:38:00] the same thing tonight really simple
[1:38:02] isn't it
[1:38:03] we're looking for these great things you
[1:38:05] say well i've obeyed the word of god
[1:38:07] okay then when you've done all you can
[1:38:08] do to stand
[1:38:10] stand
[1:38:11] that's where the devil gets us that's
[1:38:13] that denominational spirit that idea of
[1:38:16] i gotta keep pressing forward just for
[1:38:18] the sake of pressing forward no you move
[1:38:20] when the lord tells you to move that's
[1:38:22] where saul got into trouble
[1:38:24] you know saul what he said he said i
[1:38:26] feared when he tried to make an excuse
[1:38:28] to samuel you know what he said he said
[1:38:29] i feared that the people would scatter
[1:38:31] from me
[1:38:32] so i forced myself
[1:38:35] and he says because i obeyed i obeyed
[1:38:37] not the voice of god but he said i
[1:38:39] obeyed the voice of the people.
[1:38:41] so there's a there's remember there's
[1:38:43] multiple voices
[1:38:45] paul said there's many sounds there's
[1:38:47] many voices and there's none without
[1:38:49] significance
[1:38:51] what voice are we listening to remember
[1:38:53] elijah
[1:38:54] had a whirlwind and a fire and an
[1:38:56] earthquake but he was listening for a
[1:38:58] still small voice
[1:39:00] and when he recognized that he humbled
[1:39:02] himself to it and walk out
[1:39:05] but saul said i evade the voice of the
[1:39:07] people well we have a voice in our day
[1:39:09] you got a voice of the world that's
[1:39:11] calling you to do whatever you want to
[1:39:12] do and it's okay to do this or do that
[1:39:14] we see the world doing what they're
[1:39:15] doing but then there's there's a voice
[1:39:17] that's called to us in this day
[1:39:19] the voice of malachi 4 which is the
[1:39:21] voice of the word
[1:39:23] that came forth and told us to accept
[1:39:26] nothing else but the word
[1:39:29] because that's what eve did in the
[1:39:31] garden was she got away from it just by
[1:39:33] a little bit and look what happened saw
[1:39:35] one little bit
[1:39:37] and look what happened the kingdom was
[1:39:38] right from him and the lord had to say
[1:39:40] i'm gonna find me a man after my own
[1:39:41] heart
[1:39:42] and no matter what david did murderer
[1:39:45] adulterer
[1:39:46] all kinds of things that he did that was
[1:39:48] wrong and yet oh yeah but god saw his
[1:39:50] heart this time because he knew his
[1:39:52] heart was right his desire yeah he may
[1:39:55] have fallen into some traps
[1:39:56] he may have fallen down a righteous man
[1:39:58] falls but he gets up
[1:40:00] i know i've fallen many many times but i
[1:40:03] am a witness to the grace of god that he
[1:40:05] knows that my heart's desire is to give
[1:40:08] him absolutely everything that i have
[1:40:10] and obey him in everything that i that i
[1:40:12] can
[1:40:13] that i will that i and i will by his
[1:40:15] grace
[1:40:16] because it's the holy ghost that'll do
[1:40:18] it you cannot do it in yourself
[1:40:21] if jesus was the only one who could
[1:40:22] fulfill
[1:40:23] the word in that day when he came on
[1:40:25] he's still the only one that can fulfill
[1:40:27] the word in this day
[1:40:28] and if you're trying to fulfill it by
[1:40:30] your own strength you're going to be
[1:40:31] sorely disappointed
[1:40:34] we've got all this knowledge paul said
[1:40:36] yet though i have all knowledge
[1:40:39] he said all knowledge though i know all
[1:40:41] mysteries
[1:40:43] i have not charity what is charity the
[1:40:45] holy ghost
[1:40:46] the very life of christ charity you
[1:40:48] can't that's something you can't fake
[1:40:50] that's something you can't see satan can
[1:40:53] impersonate all those virtues brother
[1:40:55] branham said in statute for perfect man
[1:40:56] right there's a nature given temperance
[1:40:58] and nature giving patience all these
[1:40:59] nature given things and you can see some
[1:41:01] people that are so good the pharisees
[1:41:03] were so good people probably would have
[1:41:04] thought they had the holy ghost
[1:41:07] then brother brant he said who was there
[1:41:08] to help you when you were sick the kind
[1:41:10] of priest
[1:41:11] who was there to do this the title
[1:41:12] priest who was there to do that who gave
[1:41:14] you money when you needed it when you're
[1:41:15] a little tight on money the kind of
[1:41:16] priest and yet jesus came on the seat
[1:41:18] and said you're whited sepulcher is full
[1:41:19] of dead men's bones
[1:41:21] why because their motive and objective
[1:41:23] wasn't right
[1:41:25] and i stand before you here at least for
[1:41:27] myself and i say i've been praying this
[1:41:29] i say lord my only objective
[1:41:31] is to see the life of christ manifested
[1:41:34] in me
[1:41:35] not because i want to be any great thing
[1:41:36] but because i know it's the only way
[1:41:39] that i can fulfill the word of god is to
[1:41:41] have his life manifested in me is to be
[1:41:44] underneath that headship and then this
[1:41:46] lastly abraham we understand
[1:41:49] the story of abraham see abraham
[1:41:51] believed from the heart but it just took
[1:41:52] a while for his walk to catch up to it
[1:41:56] because the scripture says he believed
[1:41:57] god and it was counted for righteousness
[1:41:59] but then we find out he only obeyed in
[1:42:01] part to begin with because he brought
[1:42:02] lot with him
[1:42:04] brother braham said he was always a fly
[1:42:05] in the ointment
[1:42:06] and so what did god have to do got it to
[1:42:08] come down and he'll do it for you
[1:42:10] there's something he don't want to
[1:42:10] separate from don't worry he'll bring
[1:42:12] some strife
[1:42:13] he'll bring some he'll bring some
[1:42:14] conflict into your life to get you to a
[1:42:16] place where you've got to separate
[1:42:18] he'll put it there
[1:42:19] if your seed he'll put it there
[1:42:22] and so what did he do he finally
[1:42:23] separated and then here comes the lord
[1:42:25] again to confirm the promise and then he
[1:42:27] brings isaac on the scene and then what
[1:42:29] does he do again god gives him another
[1:42:30] thing here's
[1:42:31] now you got to sacrifice your son
[1:42:33] and because he was obedient to that god
[1:42:36] says in blessing i will bless thee in
[1:42:38] multiplying i will multiply thee so much
[1:42:40] so that when it came to isaac the lord
[1:42:42] come and said to isaac he said he said
[1:42:45] for thy father abraham's sake
[1:42:47] that faith was so great he said i'll
[1:42:49] bless you i'll multiply you
[1:42:52] we've got to come under that full
[1:42:54] obedience
[1:42:55] to the word
[1:42:57] brother branham says in the token i'm
[1:43:00] going to skim through this last little
[1:43:01] part if the lord allows maybe next time
[1:43:04] if we feel led that way maybe we'll kind
[1:43:06] of expand on the second part of this
[1:43:08] but
[1:43:10] uh so we understand obedience
[1:43:13] in a simple form
[1:43:14] is
[1:43:15] i tell you something you do it
[1:43:17] right
[1:43:19] but i really when i read i didn't read
[1:43:21] the full
[1:43:24] definition of obedience as i read it
[1:43:26] when i looked it up but the last little
[1:43:28] part is what just really brings it home
[1:43:31] so it says compliance with an order or
[1:43:33] quest or law
[1:43:34] or submission to another's authority
[1:43:38] that is what obedience from the heart
[1:43:41] looks like
[1:43:42] when you can lay everything down and say
[1:43:44] lord my my ways are filthy rags
[1:43:48] my ways are not your ways
[1:43:50] but lord you are righteous you alone are
[1:43:52] righteous
[1:43:53] your ways are past my ways your thoughts
[1:43:55] are above my thoughts and i lay down all
[1:43:57] my thoughts
[1:43:58] lord so so your mind can be my mind
[1:44:01] lord if you want me to be really little
[1:44:03] over here and have nothing and do
[1:44:05] nothing
[1:44:06] because it'll glorify you let me do it
[1:44:08] lord if you want me to have all things
[1:44:10] and be some rich person but it'll
[1:44:12] glorify you because you got to have
[1:44:13] someone in that position lord give me
[1:44:15] the ability to do it and he'll do it if
[1:44:17] that's if that's what he's called you to
[1:44:18] do but lord whatever paul said he said i
[1:44:20] know how to abound and to suffer need
[1:44:23] i know how to be hungry and to be full
[1:44:26] why he said because in all things
[1:44:28] as long as i have christ
[1:44:31] that's the only thing that he was under
[1:44:32] that headship brothers and sisters
[1:44:35] and so just this last little thing as we
[1:44:37] close
[1:44:38] from the token
[1:44:40] brother braham says now when you want
[1:44:42] eternal life you receive a token and
[1:44:45] we've heard these and i know we've
[1:44:46] probably heard these these quotes many
[1:44:48] times he said you receive a token
[1:44:50] showing
[1:44:51] that the price has been paid it isn't
[1:44:53] the blood but it's the token of the
[1:44:55] blood it's the life itself amen
[1:44:57] full obedience to the whole word of god
[1:45:00] to god's entire word will entitle you to
[1:45:04] this token
[1:45:05] now that if you take that on its face
[1:45:07] value
[1:45:08] sounds a whole lot like something you
[1:45:10] cannot accomplish
[1:45:13] because in yourself if you're guilty of
[1:45:15] the least you're guilty of the whole
[1:45:17] oh my
[1:45:18] the lord loves to put his people into a
[1:45:20] place where they realize their
[1:45:22] sufficiency lies in him
[1:45:24] he said how do you do it
[1:45:26] peter said on the day of pentecost
[1:45:27] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:45:29] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:45:30] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:45:32] the gift of the holy ghost the token for
[1:45:34] the promises unto you and to your
[1:45:36] children to them that's far off even as
[1:45:38] many as the lord our god shall call
[1:45:40] when they seen that wonderful display of
[1:45:42] the power of a resurrection he peter got
[1:45:46] up there and quoted the scriptures of
[1:45:47] joel and so forth give the promise for
[1:45:49] that age and showed the requirements of
[1:45:52] that age had been met in jesus christ
[1:45:54] and that he had set back a token of his
[1:45:56] death and that token was upon them
[1:45:59] and he said the token is to you and to
[1:46:02] your children and then that's far off
[1:46:03] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:46:05] call will have to have this token amen
[1:46:09] it's not they may ought to have it they
[1:46:12] shall have it you shall receive the holy
[1:46:14] ghost
[1:46:15] now listen this is what this is what
[1:46:17] really drives it home here
[1:46:19] it says when you fully obey the word of
[1:46:22] god
[1:46:23] in full surrender to it
[1:46:26] you're entitled to the token
[1:46:28] yes sir obedience not he that saith lord
[1:46:31] lord but he that doeth the will and when
[1:46:33] we pray we must have the token present
[1:46:36] with our prayer
[1:46:38] so what is it
[1:46:39] it's full submission
[1:46:41] to the headship of the word and i didn't
[1:46:43] even get to get into all the things on
[1:46:45] that line
[1:46:46] but we find
[1:46:48] you know even
[1:46:50] elijah when he heard the whirlwind and
[1:46:53] the fire and the earthquake what did he
[1:46:55] do the scripture says he veiled himself
[1:46:57] and he walked out before the lord what
[1:46:58] did that veil represent the veil
[1:46:59] represents headship
[1:47:01] he was coming under he was showing he
[1:47:02] was underneath it didn't matter what all
[1:47:04] the other things looked like it didn't
[1:47:05] matter all the signs and wonders that
[1:47:07] may have gone before which are great it
[1:47:08] didn't matter all the shouting and the
[1:47:10] dancing and singing which is great i
[1:47:12] love those things but when that still
[1:47:14] small voice came the word
[1:47:16] he recognized that he humbled himself to
[1:47:18] it
[1:47:19] and the same thing with rebecca we
[1:47:20] remember rebecca riding with eliezer
[1:47:24] on that camel writing that holy ghost
[1:47:26] writing that word all the way there
[1:47:29] but what happened when she saw isaac in
[1:47:30] the field at evening time the scripture
[1:47:32] says she veiled herself
[1:47:34] she came under headship to the word she
[1:47:37] wasn't under hership to a man's ideas
[1:47:40] she wasn't under headship to her own
[1:47:41] ideas
[1:47:43] she couldn't have any ideas
[1:47:44] why because she'd only heard what
[1:47:46] eliezer had told her
[1:47:48] and so she said i'm coming under
[1:47:49] headship to that and i'm running
[1:47:52] to my husband
[1:47:54] that's my prayer lord help me to come
[1:47:56] into full surrender to your headship
[1:48:00] because that's where the authority lies
[1:48:04] you remember brother branham told the
[1:48:06] little story about the the police
[1:48:07] officer being in the the middle of the
[1:48:09] street and he said the the poor guy out
[1:48:11] there you know he couldn't couldn't stop
[1:48:13] anything with his natural form he was
[1:48:14] just a scrawny little guy but he had
[1:48:16] that badge and he had that whistle he
[1:48:18] said what was it it wasn't
[1:48:20] it wasn't his ability
[1:48:22] but it was the authority that was it
[1:48:24] invested in him
[1:48:27] that gave the power
[1:48:29] and that's what we have to come to
[1:48:30] realize is that if we want if you want
[1:48:32] to see the power of god in your life
[1:48:34] then come under the headship of this
[1:48:36] word
[1:48:37] come under full headship
[1:48:40] search through your life
[1:48:42] i'm telling you brothers and sisters
[1:48:43] it's searching time
[1:48:44] it is searching time the death angel
[1:48:48] is out there we know that last horse
[1:48:50] rider was death it's out there seeking
[1:48:53] who doesn't have the token who's not in
[1:48:56] obedience what they do they had to go
[1:48:57] through that house looking for every
[1:48:58] little bit of leaven
[1:49:01] and say lord if there's any place in my
[1:49:03] heart
[1:49:05] it's easy to look at your flesh i fall
[1:49:07] all the time
[1:49:08] according to the flesh but i say lord
[1:49:10] look at my heart what is it if there's
[1:49:12] anything any wicked way in me anything i
[1:49:14] haven't surrendered brother branham
[1:49:16] preach the message doors door in the
[1:49:18] door and all these different door to the
[1:49:19] heart if there's a door that i've tried
[1:49:21] to close if there's a thing that i've
[1:49:23] tried to hide i've been i've been
[1:49:25] praying to the lord lord if there's
[1:49:26] anything in my past i need to make right
[1:49:27] make it known
[1:49:28] if there's anything that's hindering me
[1:49:30] in any way lord make it known i don't
[1:49:32] want an aiken in my camp
[1:49:35] i don't want to naked in my camp
[1:49:37] it's easy to look at the church as a
[1:49:39] whole but god's calling individuals
[1:49:42] to get down before him and humble
[1:49:44] themselves to the headship of the word
[1:49:48] and you'll find out this message is
[1:49:50] perfect
[1:49:52] this word is perfect
[1:49:54] you'll find it works just as good as it
[1:49:56] did back in brother branham's day
[1:49:58] it lives just as much as it did then it
[1:50:00] lives just as much as it did in jesus it
[1:50:02] lives just as much as it did in enoch's
[1:50:05] time
[1:50:06] when all what it did is so simple
[1:50:07] brothers and sisters he walked with god
[1:50:09] and he was not for god took him so
[1:50:11] simple but what did he do he was under a
[1:50:13] full headship
[1:50:14] we didn't even get to everything that we
[1:50:16] were thinking of but i trust maybe if
[1:50:18] the lord will bring it to your mind
[1:50:20] maybe the lord would have you search
[1:50:21] some of those things out
[1:50:23] you find out what that authority under
[1:50:25] headship really is when you can come
[1:50:27] into your position in the word
[1:50:30] and you find out that that's where the
[1:50:31] power lays
[1:50:33] you run out there just trying to do
[1:50:35] every which thing and whatnot and doing
[1:50:36] all this thing you'll end up like the
[1:50:38] sons of skiva
[1:50:39] just just jumping out of your place
[1:50:42] oh i'm going to go over here i'm going
[1:50:43] to go do this i'm going to go do that
[1:50:44] because of the mental conception
[1:50:46] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[1:50:48] renew their strength
[1:50:50] wait upon thy ministry
[1:50:53] wait
[1:50:54] i believe he said it even twice he said
[1:50:56] wait i say
[1:50:57] on the lord
[1:51:00] let's just stand
[1:51:04] my heart's desire
[1:51:06] by the grace of god is
[1:51:08] to be so dead to myself
[1:51:12] i don't want any part of randall verton
[1:51:13] to exist anymore
[1:51:15] i'm sick and tired of myself
[1:51:20] this flesh doesn't like to doesn't this
[1:51:22] flesh don't like to pray
[1:51:23] the flesh don't like to to witness it
[1:51:25] don't like to live the word of god
[1:51:28] but like paul said he said i find there
[1:51:30] there's a there's a law
[1:51:32] that when i would do good evil is
[1:51:33] present with me
[1:51:36] so what am i going to do i'm going to
[1:51:37] submit myself
[1:51:39] to the law and the inner man
[1:51:41] i'm going to die daily
[1:51:44] i had a brother said something that was
[1:51:46] really good i really liked it you know
[1:51:47] we were talking about that you know we
[1:51:49] talk about that all the time dying out
[1:51:51] you know in and of ourselves we don't
[1:51:53] even know how to die out
[1:51:55] we don't even know how to we we need the
[1:51:57] lord jesus to do that
[1:51:59] and he showed it in the garden when he
[1:52:02] died to himself
[1:52:04] and say lord let this cup pass from me
[1:52:05] but nevertheless
[1:52:07] not my will but thy will be done
[1:52:09] he conquered it there he's going to
[1:52:11] conquer in me he's going to conquer it
[1:52:13] in you he's going to conquer you
[1:52:16] so let's submit ourselves as living
[1:52:18] sacrifices to him
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:23] let's just bow our heads in the word of
[1:52:24] prayer
[1:52:25] lord jesus
[1:52:28] father we just love you so much lord
[1:52:31] lord we're not in and of ourselves
[1:52:33] worthy of the least of your mercies but
[1:52:35] lord god you chose us from before the
[1:52:36] foundation of the world
[1:52:39] lord you put a wedding band a
[1:52:40] predestination on us lord
[1:52:42] and then you sealed us into the day of
[1:52:44] our redemption
[1:52:47] lord i believe we've come into
[1:52:49] that obedience from the heart lord
[1:52:52] where we can display that token in our
[1:52:54] lives
[1:52:55] lord if there be anyone here lord that
[1:52:57] maybe hasn't come to that place
[1:53:00] lord may you bring them to that altar in
[1:53:02] their heart even right now
[1:53:04] and lay everything down upon it lord
[1:53:06] every desire that they would have every
[1:53:08] ambition every thought
[1:53:11] lord even if it seems good lord that
[1:53:12] scripture says lord you said there's
[1:53:14] other way that seemeth right unto a man
[1:53:17] but the end thereof is death
[1:53:21] lord
[1:53:22] i confess
[1:53:24] that i'm wrong in everything but you're
[1:53:25] right in everything
[1:53:27] lord and i surrender myself unto your
[1:53:29] word this evening

[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:52] and i thought that was
[1:58:54] so well and his brother randy was
[1:58:56] preaching i thought you know we always
[1:58:59] sometimes think
[1:59:01] of authority like some
[1:59:04] totalitarian
[1:59:06] over us you know
[1:59:07] someone that's
[1:59:09] cracking the whip and
[1:59:11] just making us obey because
[1:59:14] kind of like
[1:59:16] your kids they say why and you say
[1:59:18] because i said so
[1:59:21] but but he's not that way
[1:59:24] you know
[1:59:25] he's not approaching us as an authority
[1:59:28] he's approaching us as a guide
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:32] i will lead you and guide you into all
[1:59:35] truth why are we obedient because he's
[1:59:38] guiding us through a wilderness that
[1:59:40] we've
[1:59:40] never been in before
[1:59:43] we're coming up against spirits and
[1:59:45] things that we couldn't even imagine in
[1:59:48] our
[1:59:49] mind
[1:59:51] that
[1:59:51] is
[1:59:52] going on
[1:59:55] and so
[1:59:57] our obedience
[1:59:58] is is for our own welfare
[2:00:01] i mean he doesn't want us to be
[2:00:04] obey because he said so he wants us to
[2:00:06] obey because he's leading us
[2:00:08] and guiding us to a reward
[2:00:12] and so it's beneficial to us
[2:00:16] you know what i mean just to really
[2:00:18] understand coming into
[2:00:21] subjection to the word of god
[2:00:23] is for your own sake and for your own
[2:00:26] reward
[2:00:27] he has a large portion of heaven waiting
[2:00:30] for his bride
[2:00:31] amen i want him to lead us right there
[2:00:35] amen remember service
[2:00:37] sunday morning this will go a little
[2:00:40] farther into the message does god ever
[2:00:43] change his mind
[2:00:44] about his word
[2:00:46] amen it may certainly be a blessing to
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:49] again if you have a special prayer
[2:00:52] request on your heart
[2:00:53] something you'd like god to do and let
[2:00:56] us just
[2:00:57] make that
[2:00:58] request made known to the lord as we
[2:01:01] approaches the throne
[2:01:03] with dismissal this evening
[2:01:05] our gracious heavenly father
[2:01:08] we've heard the admonishment from the
[2:01:10] scriptures
[2:01:13] telling us all through
[2:01:16] time
[2:01:18] that those who have been
[2:01:20] successful and those who have
[2:01:24] reached their mark and ran the race
[2:01:28] succeeded by
[2:01:31] accepting your leadership
[2:01:34] and by seeking your face and
[2:01:36] seeking your leadership
[2:01:39] and bringing themselves subject to
[2:01:42] your spirit
[2:01:44] because you said you wouldn't lead us
[2:01:46] comfortless
[2:01:47] but you would
[2:01:49] come to us
[2:01:50] and that you would lead us and guide us
[2:01:53] into all truth and righteousness
[2:01:56] for father you have a place that you're
[2:01:58] guiding us to
[2:02:00] may we never lose sight of that
[2:02:03] it's not obedience for obedience sake
[2:02:07] it's obedience father to partake of the
[2:02:10] fruits
[2:02:11] of your kingdom
[2:02:12] father
[2:02:14] the people have raised their request
[2:02:16] before you father
[2:02:18] because you've asked us to
[2:02:21] lay our request at your throne
[2:02:24] for you know what we have need of even
[2:02:26] before that we ask
[2:02:28] but father when we lay our prayer out
[2:02:31] before you as children and we cry out
[2:02:35] father it
[2:02:37] lets you exercise the attribute
[2:02:40] of a father
[2:02:42] hearing the cry of the children
[2:02:45] lord hear our cry this evening and bless
[2:02:48] each one
[2:02:49] father may we take this message this
[2:02:51] evening to heart
[2:02:53] father forgive us of our trespasses
[2:02:56] forgive us father for
[2:02:58] many times you being the last one we
[2:03:01] consider instead of the first
[2:03:04] but by your grace and your mercy we
[2:03:06] shall overcome
[2:03:08] in the wonderful and precious name of
[2:03:10] jesus christ we pray
