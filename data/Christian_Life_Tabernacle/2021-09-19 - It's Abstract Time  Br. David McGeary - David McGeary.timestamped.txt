[20:24] them together this morning lord

[20:33] and
[20:34] you've set us aside for a reason for a
[20:36] purpose lord

[20:39] few are chosen and lord we claim to be
[20:42] of the chosen few this morning lord how
[20:44] glad we can say that we're one of them

[22:59] amen
[23:00] amen good to be gathered in the presence
[23:02] of the lord amen certainly you want to
[23:04] welcome everyone in the house of god
[23:06] this morning and then all our visitors
[23:08] will welcome you amen it's good to have
[23:10] with us
[23:11] uh judith's uncle brother joshua mccabe
[23:14] and his wife sister yvonne will welcome
[23:17] you this morning amen as we invite
[23:19] brother mike for us i'm ready and god
[23:20] bless you
[23:35] good morning
[23:39] you know when we uh
[23:40] often when we read the psalms there's
[23:44] sometimes uh
[23:45] we miss it there's a little introductory
[23:47] statement some
[23:49] few little words perhaps in italics that
[23:52] are underneath
[23:54] the psalm underneath the chapter
[23:57] and you know sometimes it's those little
[23:59] words
[24:00] that change completely
[24:03] how we might look at the psalm
[24:07] you know psalm 49 is one of those
[24:08] chapters
[24:11] and it certainly catches my attention
[24:13] when
[24:15] those little words describe this as a
[24:18] psalm for the sons of korah
[24:22] this is a psalm written especially
[24:26] for them
[24:28] you know we're no doubt familiar with
[24:30] the
[24:31] sorry tale
[24:33] of korra
[24:35] you know he was a levite
[24:36] a minister
[24:38] who gathered together a group of people
[24:42] against the word of god for his
[24:44] hour you know it's a minister who
[24:46] believed he had a new revelation
[24:50] you know what maybe he had a clear
[24:52] teaching you know
[24:54] and he influenced
[24:56] many others
[24:58] you know declaring a position against
[25:00] the move of god in that day
[25:03] of course this led to a showdown
[25:06] in numbers 16
[25:08] and uh
[25:09] you know the lord demonstrated where he
[25:11] stood
[25:14] the earth opened up and swallowed korra
[25:16] there was a fire that went out from the
[25:17] lord
[25:18] the next day there was a plague that
[25:20] killed thousands
[25:23] even their little children
[25:25] it says in numbers 16 27.
[25:30] it's certainly a very sobering story in
[25:32] a kind of a reminder
[25:34] of the importance of not getting too
[25:36] caught up in our own little revelation
[25:41] making sure that it lines up with the
[25:43] word for the hour
[25:46] but i think it was brother john andes
[25:48] was here a couple weeks ago and he
[25:51] he mentioned uh an interesting
[25:54] scripture and it was in numbers 26 11
[25:58] which says this
[26:00] notwithstanding
[26:01] the children of korah died not
[26:05] so while all the other children of all
[26:08] the other families
[26:11] perished gruesomely
[26:13] really
[26:14] over the course of two days for some
[26:16] reason
[26:18] the children of korah the one who had
[26:21] led
[26:22] this rebellion
[26:24] were specifically spared by the lord
[26:29] when all around them perished these
[26:32] who would seem most worthy of death
[26:36] were preserved by the lord
[26:40] you know many generations later these
[26:42] children
[26:43] they show up again the sons of korah
[26:45] show up in scripture again
[26:47] the scripture also calls them core
[26:49] heights as it says in exodus 6 24.
[26:53] but you know it's in first chronicles 6
[26:55] when david is laying out the order of
[26:58] worship
[27:00] and the ministry of the temple and
[27:03] you know the things pertaining to the
[27:05] restoration of the work
[27:09] they show up again in this
[27:11] in this story we're all familiar with
[27:13] asaph
[27:14] we've heard the name
[27:15] you know one of the levites was
[27:17] appointed as a musician who led in the
[27:19] worship at the temple
[27:21] but you know there was another
[27:24] and it says in 1st chronicles 6 31
[27:28] and these are they whom david set over
[27:30] the service of song in the house of the
[27:33] lord after that the ark had rest
[27:36] and they ministered before the dwelling
[27:38] place of the tabernacle of the
[27:40] congregation with singing
[27:42] until solomon had built the house of the
[27:44] lord in jerusalem and then they waited
[27:47] on their office according to their order
[27:50] and these are they
[27:52] that waited with their children
[27:55] of the sons of the kohathites
[27:58] heman
[27:59] a singer
[28:01] it goes on in verse 37 to identify that
[28:04] he was
[28:05] the son of korah
[28:07] went through his entire genealogy and he
[28:10] turns out to be
[28:11] one of the sons of korah
[28:15] so here we have the sons of korah
[28:18] and all his children it identifies 17 of
[28:20] them
[28:22] that are now identified as worshipers in
[28:24] the house of the lord
[28:27] in first chronicles 25
[28:30] goes a little bit further in verse 1. it
[28:32] says moreover david and the captains of
[28:35] the host
[28:36] separated to the service of the sons of
[28:38] asaph
[28:40] and heman
[28:41] and of judgethen who should prophesy
[28:45] with harps with salt trees
[28:48] and with symbols
[28:50] so not only
[28:51] were they worshipers in the house of the
[28:53] lord
[28:54] but now they were speaking forth the
[28:56] word of god with their lips
[29:01] these are those
[29:02] sons of core in fact in verse 5 it goes
[29:05] so far as to say that heman was the
[29:08] king's seer
[29:10] in the words of god to lift up
[29:13] the horn
[29:15] a prophet of the lord
[29:19] you know those who you would think would
[29:20] be worthy of death
[29:23] and a partaker of the judgment of their
[29:26] father
[29:27] had been lifted up to become a worshiper
[29:31] in the house of the lord
[29:32] and to take the word of god on their
[29:34] lips and speak it forth
[29:38] here's another
[29:40] second chronicles 5 12.
[29:43] also the levites which were the singers
[29:46] all of them of asaph and heman
[29:49] the sons of korah
[29:51] and jejuthin with their sons and
[29:52] brethren being arrayed in white linen
[29:59] and finally there's a story in second
[30:01] chronicles 20 of an hour
[30:03] when a great enemy came up against the
[30:05] children of israel and it seemed like
[30:07] they could not overcome and
[30:09] king jehoshaphat and the people they
[30:10] fell on their face before the lord
[30:13] calling out to him for deliverance and
[30:14] it says in
[30:16] verse 17 that the word of the lord came
[30:18] and said this ye shall not need to fight
[30:20] in this battle
[30:22] set yourselves
[30:24] stand ye still
[30:25] and see the salvation of the lord
[30:29] and it's in verse 19
[30:31] that the core heights
[30:33] the sons of korah
[30:35] began to raise their voice in worship
[30:37] and praise what it says the beauty of
[30:39] holiness
[30:41] it says in verse 21 and in verse 22
[30:44] when they
[30:45] the sons of korah
[30:47] began to sing in praise
[30:50] the lord set ambushments against the
[30:52] children of ammon
[30:54] moab and mount seir which were come
[30:57] against judah
[30:58] and they were smitten
[31:01] because of their worship
[31:03] because of the sons of korah the enemy
[31:06] was defeated
[31:09] the children of korah
[31:12] and psalm 49 is their song
[31:16] it says in verse 5 of psalm 49
[31:20] this is what the songs this is a song
[31:22] for the sons of korah to sing
[31:25] wherefore should i fear
[31:27] in the days of evil
[31:29] when the iniquity of my heels the
[31:31] iniquity of my past
[31:34] shall compass me about
[31:36] they that trust in their wealth and
[31:38] boast themselves in the multitude of
[31:40] their riches
[31:41] none of them can by any means redeem his
[31:44] brother
[31:46] nor give god a ransom for him
[31:50] these were people
[31:53] who knew a little bit about redemption
[31:56] when they could have been consumed
[31:59] when they deserved
[32:01] to be consumed and perished and judged
[32:03] because of the sins of their father
[32:06] by the mercy of the lord god plucked
[32:08] them out
[32:10] and raised them up
[32:12] clothed them in white linen set them in
[32:14] a place that they could be worshippers
[32:16] in the house of the lord even so much as
[32:19] to take the word of god and put it on
[32:20] their lips
[32:22] and by their worship defeat the enemy
[32:25] this is somebody who knows something
[32:27] about redemption
[32:29] this is their
[32:30] redemption
[32:31] song
[32:33] there was none that could sing this song
[32:35] this was a song specifically for
[32:38] the sons of korah
[32:40] [Music]
[32:41] is psalm 49 goes on to describe the
[32:43] foolishness of mankind around them
[32:45] but as they sing in verse 17 it says
[32:48] this when he dieth
[32:50] he shall carry nothing away
[32:52] his glory shall not descend after him
[32:55] but now this is the testimony of the
[32:57] sons of korah in verse 15
[32:59] but god will redeem my soul
[33:03] from the power of the grave
[33:06] he shall receive me
[33:08] selah
[33:10] i'm just curious are there any sons of
[33:12] korah in the house tonight
[33:15] somebody who might have been worthy of
[33:16] death
[33:18] worthy to be consumed because of the
[33:21] sins of their father
[33:22] but yet god plucked you out in his mercy
[33:25] he puts you in a place as a worshiper in
[33:28] his house he clothed you with white
[33:30] linen he put the word of god in your
[33:33] lips that you might speak it and by
[33:35] taking that word be able to defeat the
[33:37] enemy
[33:38] any sons of korah in the house this
[33:40] morning
[33:41] this is the psalm of the sons of korah
[33:44] so if we read that this morning you know
[33:46] i hope that you can put yourself in the
[33:48] scripture
[33:49] let's just go ahead and read that
[33:51] starting in verse 1.
[33:53] hear this all ye people give ear all ye
[33:56] inhabitants of the world both low and
[33:59] high rich and poor together
[34:02] my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the
[34:04] meditation of my heart shall be of
[34:06] understanding i will incline mine near
[34:09] to a parable i will open my dark saying
[34:12] upon the harp
[34:14] wherefore should i fear in the days of
[34:16] evil when the iniquity of my heels shall
[34:19] compass me about
[34:20] they that trust in their wealth and
[34:23] boast themselves in the multitude of
[34:24] their riches none of them can by any
[34:27] means redeem his brother nor give to god
[34:30] a ransom for him for the redemption of
[34:33] their soul is precious and it ceaseth
[34:36] forever
[34:37] then he should still live forever and
[34:39] not see corruption for he seeth that
[34:42] wise men die likewise the fool and the
[34:45] brutish person perish and leave their
[34:47] wealth to others their inward thought is
[34:50] that their houses shall continue forever
[34:53] and their dwelling places to all
[34:55] generations they call their lands after
[34:57] their own names nevertheless man being
[35:00] in honor abideth not he is like the
[35:03] beasts that perish this their way is
[35:06] their folly yet their posterity approve
[35:09] their sayings selah
[35:11] like sheep they are laid in the grave
[35:14] death shall feed on them and the upright
[35:16] shall have dominion over them in the
[35:18] morning and their beauty shall consume
[35:21] in the grave from their dwelling but god
[35:24] will redeem my soul from the power of
[35:26] the grave he shall receive me selah for
[35:30] not thou prayed when one is made rich
[35:33] when the glory of his house is increased
[35:36] for when he dieth he shall carry nothing
[35:38] away his glory shall not descend after
[35:41] him though while he lived he blessed his
[35:44] soul and men will praise thee when thou
[35:47] doest well to thyself he shall go to the
[35:50] generation of his fathers they shall
[35:52] never see light man that is in honor and
[35:56] understandeth not is like the beasts
[35:58] that perish amen
[36:03] amen god bless you may have your seeds

[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:48] you paid a price at calvary so
[1:01:51] we could enter into that fellowship
[1:01:55] and then you imparted that same spirit
[1:01:57] that quickens your mortal body
[1:02:00] and you gave it to us oh lord
[1:02:03] father may we just see what a beautiful
[1:02:06] thing
[1:02:07] that is this morning
[1:02:09] we just ask you father that each need
[1:02:13] that's

[1:02:17] every struggle
[1:02:20] every hungry heart
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:24] the questions and the burdens
[1:02:29] you said father if we'd cast them upon
[1:02:31] you that
[1:02:32] your burden was easy
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] and that you administered to us
[1:02:40] we invite you to do that this morning
[1:02:45] be with us today father and each one
[1:02:49] we ask these wonderful things
[1:02:51] in jesus precious name we pray
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:56] amen god bless you may be seated this
[1:02:58] morning
[1:03:01] certainly uh
[1:03:04] yeah we're done
[1:03:06] uh certainly wonderful to be back in the
[1:03:08] house of the lord and i spent a few days
[1:03:11] with my mother and she's really doing
[1:03:13] well
[1:03:15] she went fishing with me
[1:03:17] and
[1:03:18] so we sat out on the pier she spent
[1:03:21] eight hours out there
[1:03:23] you know she even got the pole and put
[1:03:26] it over the side so
[1:03:27] we're
[1:03:28] really
[1:03:30] grateful for that and just trusting that
[1:03:32] the lord will bless you
[1:03:34] we just wanted uh before we start this
[1:03:36] morning
[1:03:37] that you know the
[1:03:39] services were so good as i watched the
[1:03:41] brothers preach and
[1:03:43] break the word of god i thought they
[1:03:45] raised such a high standard i was afraid
[1:03:48] that i wouldn't be able to meet it i i
[1:03:50] was going to stay a few more weeks
[1:03:53] but
[1:03:54] we'll be in missouri next weekend and
[1:03:56] we're happy to be here with you today
[1:03:58] and we trust the lord
[1:04:00] we want to take this moment right now
[1:04:03] we're going to
[1:04:04] brother cosman
[1:04:06] and brother matthew are going to be
[1:04:08] heading to
[1:04:09] romania for a couple weeks to minister
[1:04:13] there and
[1:04:14] and you know we don't always see
[1:04:17] people's gifts in our
[1:04:19] place and you know the scripture even
[1:04:21] says that many times in your own country
[1:04:25] you're not recognized you know but
[1:04:29] you know when cosmon goes there he'll be
[1:04:31] ministering over there and preaching and
[1:04:34] you might not know him here as a
[1:04:36] minister as a preacher he's done so many
[1:04:39] other things for us but on that field
[1:04:42] that's where his calling is
[1:04:44] and
[1:04:45] you know so he's just not going as an
[1:04:47] interpreter he's actually going to hold
[1:04:50] services himself and preach and minister
[1:04:53] the word of god so we're we're grateful
[1:04:56] for both of them and the lord sends them
[1:04:58] out in twos and so they're going out
[1:05:02] from us
[1:05:04] amen the
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:07] tithing and offering that you give will
[1:05:09] go to help support
[1:05:11] their trip and so we're going to ask
[1:05:14] them if they would come up if kosman and
[1:05:16] matthew had come up if they're
[1:05:18] here and we just want to
[1:05:20] ask
[1:05:21] we just want to
[1:05:23] all of us to pray together
[1:05:25] with them and ask them thing that the
[1:05:28] holy spirit will give them one mind
[1:05:31] and and the unity together
[1:05:34] and that uh that
[1:05:37] the love of christ will be reflected
[1:05:40] in their humility
[1:05:43] and and through that that they might
[1:05:45] know
[1:05:46] it's not that they're bringing
[1:05:49] things that
[1:05:50] they've
[1:05:52] maybe the people don't know but
[1:05:54] just every little bit adds on
[1:05:57] and builds so we just wanted to take
[1:06:00] this time just to
[1:06:02] lay our hands on them and ask them that
[1:06:05] the holy spirit
[1:06:06] would be with them our gracious heavenly
[1:06:08] father
[1:06:10] as part of our body father they
[1:06:12] represent us
[1:06:15] father and we have identified ourself
[1:06:18] with your gospel
[1:06:20] with your name
[1:06:21] with the message that you've sent
[1:06:24] and father we ask that your spirit
[1:06:26] father just so
[1:06:28] quicken them heavenly father that the
[1:06:31] light of the gospel would shine through
[1:06:33] them
[1:06:34] and father that they'd recognize that
[1:06:37] there's something
[1:06:38] different
[1:06:40] a love that is shed abroad from their
[1:06:42] heart
[1:06:43] father a humility that
[1:06:46] the people can see it's not about them
[1:06:48] and
[1:06:49] they're not trying to make a name
[1:06:51] they're just trying to bring the life
[1:06:53] and the promises and the power
[1:06:55] to the people father may their minds be
[1:06:58] clear may their hearts be open to your
[1:07:01] leadership
[1:07:02] father may they be in such harmony
[1:07:05] that as they go together that your
[1:07:07] spirit would be so manifested father may
[1:07:10] they see the fruits of their labor
[1:07:12] may the those that they come in contact
[1:07:15] know that they've meant you in the flesh
[1:07:18] we ask you to go with them now in jesus
[1:07:21] precious name we pray amen god bless you
[1:07:24] brothers we trust the lord my belief
[1:07:26] delete
[1:07:28] i got a little testimony
[1:07:30] before i know i'm kind of
[1:07:33] you know before i get in the word but
[1:07:37] you know
[1:07:38] the other day i
[1:07:39] came out of my room and i hadn't
[1:07:42] cut my hair for
[1:07:44] about three weeks you know i was feeling
[1:07:46] pretty good
[1:07:48] pretty scruff but
[1:07:50] i had to go to a barber
[1:07:53] and
[1:07:54] i never pray about going to a barber
[1:07:58] you know but all of a sudden i just felt
[1:08:00] you know i knew the lord i just had this
[1:08:02] burden on my heart to pray for a barber
[1:08:05] and i had a place i always went i wasn't
[1:08:08] real happy
[1:08:10] there they cut hair real good but
[1:08:12] you know
[1:08:13] they're kind of
[1:08:15] you know biker type guys you know and
[1:08:18] and so i just didn't feel like going
[1:08:19] there and i thought of the different
[1:08:21] shops that i'd been to and and
[1:08:26] so i i thought you know i'll um
[1:08:29] i'll sit down and i i look what it where
[1:08:32] what are the shops in the area
[1:08:35] and my heart fell upon this one barber
[1:08:39] and shop and i don't know why i wasn't
[1:08:41] even the kind of name that i would be
[1:08:44] attracted to
[1:08:45] so i tried to call him up and i didn't
[1:08:48] get that shop i got another shop and i
[1:08:50] and i said no that's that didn't fit
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] so i finally got a hold of it and i
[1:08:56] asked the person i said are you open yes
[1:08:58] and do you have time to cut my hair yes
[1:09:01] i came in there and i was the only one
[1:09:03] in the barber shop which i really like
[1:09:08] i don't like it when there's a bunch of
[1:09:09] people there and then that guy's
[1:09:10] clipping your hair so fast you know
[1:09:13] and so i sat down and i listened and
[1:09:16] they had christian music playing
[1:09:19] uh and uh
[1:09:22] and a nice lady and and uh
[1:09:25] uh
[1:09:25] you know had her little dog there and
[1:09:28] and uh so
[1:09:30] we got to talking you know and about uh
[1:09:34] she was talking about her business and
[1:09:36] how how hard it was but yet she felt the
[1:09:39] lord had given it to her and i was
[1:09:42] encouraging her along
[1:09:44] and everything and i it you know it i
[1:09:48] knew i was drawn there
[1:09:50] you understand that i mean i don't see i
[1:09:52] sat down and i prayed lord show me where
[1:09:55] you want me to have my hair cut
[1:09:57] i don't have that much hair that you
[1:09:59] really need to get a word of the lord to
[1:10:01] have it cut you know
[1:10:04] but i i just felt to go so we got to
[1:10:07] talking and
[1:10:09] and somehow the conversation
[1:10:12] she came that
[1:10:13] found out i was a pastor you know and oh
[1:10:16] praise god i'm cutting the hair of a
[1:10:18] pastor you know
[1:10:20] and uh
[1:10:21] and
[1:10:22] i said no don't worry we're all sinners
[1:10:24] saved by grace
[1:10:26] so as we talked along a little bit i
[1:10:28] said to her i said you know i'd like to
[1:10:30] bring you a book
[1:10:33] to
[1:10:35] to read
[1:10:36] i i it encouraged you in a faith and i
[1:10:38] thought i'd give her
[1:10:40] man sent
[1:10:41] from god you know
[1:10:42] and really encourage her and then she
[1:10:45] said you know
[1:10:48] there was a young black man that came in
[1:10:50] here
[1:10:52] and to
[1:10:53] have his hair cut
[1:10:55] and he gave me two books and
[1:10:59] and i said oh she said and she ran over
[1:11:01] and grabbed them
[1:11:02] and it was the token
[1:11:06] and uh
[1:11:08] and well i i just
[1:11:10] i trying to think of what the other
[1:11:12] it
[1:11:13] it was
[1:11:14] i think it was maybe uh
[1:11:16] uh the token and uh the voice of the
[1:11:19] sign or
[1:11:20] uh then i thought there she had two
[1:11:22] brother branham books right there that
[1:11:24] someone i don't even know if the brother
[1:11:26] goes to our church or not but
[1:11:28] uh i just thought you know what
[1:11:31] there's something there and i i just
[1:11:33] really felt that maybe that god's going
[1:11:35] to do something i don't know what'll
[1:11:37] come out of it
[1:11:38] but uh i just thought that that was
[1:11:41] pretty special
[1:11:43] to me to know that that
[1:11:45] we have a god
[1:11:47] that's worked and and so whoever that
[1:11:49] young man was if he if he
[1:11:51] comes to our fellowship he says he sings
[1:11:54] and
[1:11:55] and so but anyway i just think that it
[1:11:58] just lets you know god's
[1:12:00] god will do whatever he has to do
[1:12:02] amen he's that kind of god
[1:12:05] so well let's fellowship around god's
[1:12:07] word this morning i i don't know exactly
[1:12:10] how to approach
[1:12:13] the things that are in my heart i went
[1:12:15] out to san diego and i took a couple
[1:12:18] books with me i took the book that we're
[1:12:20] studying out of
[1:12:22] it is is the rising of the sun
[1:12:25] i took leadership and i took proving his
[1:12:28] word
[1:12:29] and when i got back into
[1:12:33] this message here
[1:12:35] is at the rising of the sun
[1:12:38] in the two weeks that i was gone i only
[1:12:40] covered five pages
[1:12:44] and
[1:12:45] it's so rich
[1:12:47] and so beautiful
[1:12:49] that we'll just try to go through it so
[1:12:51] i think i'm going to approach a little
[1:12:53] different this morning
[1:12:55] we're just going to go through it and
[1:12:56] minister out of it
[1:12:58] and then we'll listen to it at the end
[1:13:02] 14 minutes so let's stand together this
[1:13:04] morning
[1:13:06] and let's turn in our bibles
[1:13:09] to
[1:13:12] the gospel or
[1:13:14] the
[1:13:15] prophecy if you would like to speak of
[1:13:17] it that way of malachi
[1:13:20] and
[1:13:24] and we'll read in the fourth
[1:13:27] chapter of malachi
[1:13:32] starting with the fourth
[1:13:34] verse
[1:13:40] and it says remember ye
[1:13:43] malachi
[1:13:45] 4
[1:13:47] 4
[1:13:48] remember ye the law of moses
[1:13:52] my servant
[1:13:54] which i commanded
[1:13:56] unto him in horeb
[1:13:58] for all israel
[1:14:01] with the statutes and judgments
[1:14:04] he says behold i will send you elijah
[1:14:08] the prophet before the coming
[1:14:11] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:14:14] lord
[1:14:15] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:14:18] fathers
[1:14:19] to the children
[1:14:21] and the hearts of the children to their
[1:14:23] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:14:28] with a curse
[1:14:29] our heavenly father we ask you to bless
[1:14:31] your word to us this morning
[1:14:34] in jesus precious name we pray
[1:14:36] amen god bless you may be seated
[1:14:47] as we've been
[1:14:49] uh
[1:14:51] walking through this uh
[1:14:54] wonderful uh
[1:14:57] sermon that we've been
[1:15:00] playing and studying
[1:15:02] we've been
[1:15:03] talking about
[1:15:05] the scripture that
[1:15:07] our messenger used that if the same
[1:15:10] spirit
[1:15:11] that was in christ jesus dwell in you
[1:15:14] it will also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:15:19] and the prophet of god is in this great
[1:15:21] message is
[1:15:23] obviously we understand that men have
[1:15:26] had so many different ideas and so many
[1:15:29] different viewpoints they've been taught
[1:15:32] so many things and had so many things
[1:15:35] explained to them
[1:15:36] that there's a desire and a call in
[1:15:39] man's heart for the truth
[1:15:42] uh we know that there's
[1:15:44] that we have just been in our country
[1:15:48] through uh
[1:15:49] uh what they refer to as a pandemic or a
[1:15:53] plague
[1:15:54] and uh you know somebody developed a bug
[1:15:58] and the bug got out into society and it
[1:16:01] just lets you know you know the prophet
[1:16:03] of god said he said they were there
[1:16:05] looking in those test tubes and and
[1:16:08] he the called out to him they just
[1:16:10] looked up and kept going on and you know
[1:16:13] we've always wondered what was all that
[1:16:16] i've seen that applied to so many things
[1:16:19] but yet we have something that just
[1:16:21] actually affected and changed the world
[1:16:26] it affected us there's been people that
[1:16:29] we haven't seen at church for over a
[1:16:32] year year and a half
[1:16:35] some people have
[1:16:36] gone and some have fallen away and and
[1:16:40] it's caused
[1:16:41] very
[1:16:42] a lot of
[1:16:44] different choices and we know that
[1:16:47] through it all there's been all kinds of
[1:16:49] information and all kinds of things told
[1:16:52] uh some people are afraid of of the
[1:16:55] vaccine and
[1:16:57] and i i don't blame them for that you
[1:17:00] know others ask me should i
[1:17:04] uh should i get the vaccine well i
[1:17:06] believe it's a personal choice uh
[1:17:09] i did
[1:17:10] but uh i don't know if that i got
[1:17:13] i
[1:17:14] had the
[1:17:17] sickness and i've got through it i'm
[1:17:19] supposed to have natural immunity and
[1:17:22] and after yet i take the shot and i wear
[1:17:24] a mask and they put you on the plane
[1:17:27] with
[1:17:28] 350 people that you don't know whether
[1:17:31] they're sick or not
[1:17:32] and and they all take their mask off to
[1:17:35] eat and this this
[1:17:37] bug knows when you're standing and it
[1:17:39] knows when you're sitting you know it
[1:17:41] knows if you've been good or bad you
[1:17:43] know
[1:17:46] so uh it you know it the it's it's
[1:17:49] it's
[1:17:50] uh it's a mass
[1:17:53] confusion
[1:17:54] and satan is the author of confusion
[1:17:59] and you you've got to understand that
[1:18:02] part of all this is exactly what's all
[1:18:06] in the plan of god
[1:18:08] because when something like this all
[1:18:11] comes up
[1:18:12] i
[1:18:13] i remember when the first heart
[1:18:16] transplant
[1:18:18] came
[1:18:19] i mean
[1:18:20] everybody was you know wondering well
[1:18:23] are your souls in your heart and are you
[1:18:25] going to get somebody else's soul like
[1:18:28] you know like people were worried like
[1:18:31] they were the next transplant patient
[1:18:34] but you know things like this cause
[1:18:36] things and it affects your mind
[1:18:40] and we're gonna we're gonna work towards
[1:18:42] something here this morning so it
[1:18:43] affects your mind
[1:18:45] and people don't know how to think
[1:18:48] that and they don't know so satan's
[1:18:50] offered this confusion
[1:18:52] and and and the confusion is an
[1:18:56] atmosphere
[1:18:58] it's an atmosphere in a confused
[1:19:01] atmosphere a panic and these different
[1:19:04] things that are created you find
[1:19:07] yourself in something and you don't know
[1:19:09] how to to respond you don't know how to
[1:19:12] react you don't know what's the
[1:19:15] politically correct thing to say or do
[1:19:18] or how to respond
[1:19:20] and that's
[1:19:22] that is by design
[1:19:25] and because that's what the enemy is
[1:19:27] trying to do he's trying to prepare the
[1:19:29] people
[1:19:31] for his complete
[1:19:33] uh
[1:19:33] takeover
[1:19:35] you know where the at where the
[1:19:36] antichrist will come and
[1:19:38] and it won't necessarily be
[1:19:41] as we might think and one certain person
[1:19:44] but we know that the mark of the beast
[1:19:46] is on your forehead and we understand
[1:19:49] that's to take the thinking
[1:19:51] and the mark on your hand is to do the
[1:19:54] work
[1:19:55] and he wants to place this mark on us
[1:19:58] but god has a mark
[1:20:00] amen and he has something that he's
[1:20:03] desiring to mark us with
[1:20:06] and so we under we
[1:20:08] we saw that this great thing that our we
[1:20:10] begin to talk about
[1:20:12] that
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:14] god wanted to impart
[1:20:17] to
[1:20:18] his children his spirit
[1:20:22] and we talked about this spirit he and
[1:20:25] our messenger is trying to bring us to
[1:20:27] the understanding that there's something
[1:20:30] special
[1:20:32] about
[1:20:33] this power that's given to the church in
[1:20:37] this day
[1:20:39] that there is a quickening power
[1:20:41] there is a the spirit of god that has
[1:20:45] been set aside for this day to be given
[1:20:49] to his elect children that is going to
[1:20:52] manifest something and in our heart
[1:20:56] there's been a struggle for that and
[1:20:59] that we've always desired to have the
[1:21:02] spirit of god
[1:21:04] and
[1:21:05] and so we began to look and he began to
[1:21:08] tell us about trying to express to us
[1:21:12] what this great quickening power is
[1:21:15] and and it was beautiful because he took
[1:21:18] us through how that what the seed is
[1:21:20] planted and the sun has got the shine on
[1:21:24] it to bring it to life
[1:21:27] as we listen to that
[1:21:28] we begin to
[1:21:30] understand that the struggle is not ours
[1:21:34] it's not our struggle
[1:21:36] jesus said look at the little lily look
[1:21:39] at it neither toils nor it spins but yet
[1:21:43] look how it's adorned with glory solomon
[1:21:47] all his glory isn't in that ordained
[1:21:50] just is one of these lilies another
[1:21:52] cause the lily didn't
[1:21:54] make itself into a lily
[1:21:58] it was god that made it into a lily and
[1:22:02] i believe he's trying to bring us to a
[1:22:03] place where we come to a peace and we
[1:22:07] understand that the struggle is not ours
[1:22:09] the battle is not ours
[1:22:12] it's his work we're his workmanship in
[1:22:16] christ jesus foreordained unto good
[1:22:19] works that we should walk in them
[1:22:23] and so it's not we don't have to find
[1:22:25] the work we don't have to go make the
[1:22:28] work he he told us he said that a sheep
[1:22:32] it doesn't produce wool
[1:22:34] it doesn't go out there and say i'm
[1:22:36] going to eat this and i'm going to do
[1:22:38] this and i'm going to go here and drink
[1:22:41] this and do all these mechanical things
[1:22:45] that's going to produce
[1:22:48] wool no he says he bears wool he bears
[1:22:52] wool because he bears it from his nature
[1:22:55] because that's the way that he was made
[1:22:59] and and we were made
[1:23:03] the sons and daughters of god
[1:23:06] so much so that he had our names in the
[1:23:10] lamb's book of life before the
[1:23:12] foundation of the world
[1:23:14] and now this great message is coming to
[1:23:17] us it's beginning to speak to us and so
[1:23:20] we understood that man has always tried
[1:23:22] to accomplish things through his works
[1:23:26] through his mechanics
[1:23:28] and and but he's now he's trying to tell
[1:23:30] something but god's got something else
[1:23:33] for the believer and something else for
[1:23:36] the church that that that comes from him
[1:23:40] and quickens and anoints them and brings
[1:23:45] to life
[1:23:47] what that god had planted in you
[1:23:50] so and we call this the quickening power
[1:23:55] quickening means to be made alive and
[1:23:59] you can do everything that you want to
[1:24:02] do you can light candles you can read
[1:24:05] prayer books
[1:24:07] you can you can
[1:24:09] do all the rituals that you want and
[1:24:13] that will never bring that to life
[1:24:17] there's only one thing that brings it to
[1:24:20] life and that's the word of god
[1:24:24] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:24:27] the word of god so the gospel is what
[1:24:31] god chose god chose the foolishness of
[1:24:33] preaching he told by the gospel he who
[1:24:37] hath an ear to hear let him hear
[1:24:40] look that's the way that god chose it he
[1:24:44] chose to come preaching and that's what
[1:24:46] jesus did he came preaching
[1:24:49] and went into the synagogues and he went
[1:24:51] and he began to spread the good news
[1:24:54] talking about a father and above and a
[1:24:57] kingdom that was to come okay and that
[1:25:00] uh in our that our hearts and our lives
[1:25:04] but not to be deceived by this present
[1:25:07] world in fact the scripture says the
[1:25:09] present evil
[1:25:11] world not to be deceived by this world
[1:25:14] connect not to come to a place where
[1:25:17] you're entrapped by the things that they
[1:25:19] teach and the things that they say
[1:25:22] so much so
[1:25:23] that the word of god tells us that
[1:25:25] education in science and civilization is
[1:25:29] of the devil it never was in the
[1:25:32] beginning of god's plan but it's
[1:25:35] something that that man has began to
[1:25:38] strive after because he he took from the
[1:25:41] the fruit of the tree of knowledge and
[1:25:45] and wisdom and knowledge puffeth up
[1:25:49] and
[1:25:50] and
[1:25:51] knowledge is forever learning
[1:25:55] and there's no peace in it there's no
[1:25:58] rest in it but yet here's a gospel
[1:26:01] that's going out for them that have an
[1:26:04] ear for those that can hear that there's
[1:26:07] something that god is going to provide
[1:26:10] his children and it's himself
[1:26:13] it's his spirit
[1:26:15] amen he said john surely came them
[1:26:18] baptized with water under the repentance
[1:26:20] of sin but i've come to be baptized you
[1:26:22] at the holy ghost
[1:26:25] so that's what we're talking about we're
[1:26:27] talking about a power
[1:26:30] that comes from god
[1:26:34] and it can make alive in you
[1:26:40] amen something that
[1:26:44] nothing else can make alive but him
[1:26:47] because spirit that could make you alive
[1:26:50] that's what every time we say quicken if
[1:26:52] you put in your heart make alive
[1:26:55] bring to life
[1:26:57] and so he'd be talking to talk about man
[1:27:00] because that and he and preaching a man
[1:27:02] there's a spirit
[1:27:04] that can come from god
[1:27:07] can make you alive
[1:27:09] cannot just in this world but in the
[1:27:13] world to come
[1:27:17] it it's a it's a a gift of god eternal
[1:27:22] life
[1:27:22] and it'll make you alive and not only
[1:27:25] will it make your spirit alive but it
[1:27:28] will also quicken this mortal body make
[1:27:32] this mortal body alive
[1:27:35] and so man has tried to do it and this
[1:27:38] is how we've went so far that man has
[1:27:40] tried to
[1:27:42] obtain
[1:27:44] this spiritual
[1:27:47] cry of his heart
[1:27:49] because there's a deep that calls to a
[1:27:52] deed
[1:27:53] there's something that's built in you
[1:27:56] by by the divine province of god
[1:28:00] is something that wants to come alive it
[1:28:03] wants to come out if there's there's
[1:28:06] something in you that you've got a
[1:28:08] consciousness of god that's why the
[1:28:11] curse in this generation says they no
[1:28:13] longer want to keep god in their
[1:28:15] conscience
[1:28:17] they don't only want to be mindful of
[1:28:18] god and their conscience is seared with
[1:28:21] a hot iron that they no longer retain
[1:28:24] god in their knowledge
[1:28:27] but it's not so for you
[1:28:30] most of you can go back no matter how
[1:28:32] you raised when you were a little kid
[1:28:37] they're just you had this sense
[1:28:41] of a god
[1:28:42] you had their this sense that they're
[1:28:46] the only way i can express it is
[1:28:49] here you have a family you have
[1:28:51] everything but yet there's another part
[1:28:53] of you that you didn't feel you belonged
[1:28:59] that this really isn't
[1:29:02] like you're an alien
[1:29:08] i can hardly explain it
[1:29:11] and at the end you went through life and
[1:29:13] then you you heard about
[1:29:16] the things of god
[1:29:19] and you were attracted to him
[1:29:23] and so
[1:29:24] we we understood as our messages trying
[1:29:27] to express to us
[1:29:31] you
[1:29:32] you you can't
[1:29:35] obtain
[1:29:38] what's given to you
[1:29:42] by work
[1:29:45] now you have to have mechanics you have
[1:29:48] to be in order you have to do but you
[1:29:51] need something that makes it move
[1:29:54] and so we're trying to separate
[1:29:57] the spirit of god and the quickening
[1:29:59] power of god from anything that man does
[1:30:06] it's a gift
[1:30:09] it's not an earned gift
[1:30:12] it's a gift
[1:30:14] and so we we got sorted through the
[1:30:17] message and if and we're going to just
[1:30:20] we started picking up
[1:30:23] here
[1:30:24] uh
[1:30:25] it we went as far as the
[1:30:29] the paragraphs of 225.
[1:30:36] and and so we'll just kind of just walk
[1:30:38] through this real quick together this
[1:30:41] morning
[1:30:42] it says the quickening power wasn't only
[1:30:45] in their soul
[1:30:47] but it was all
[1:30:49] over them
[1:30:51] not only the dynamics come in to quicken
[1:30:55] but it quickened the mechanics too
[1:30:58] you see what i mean
[1:31:00] they were so quickened until their
[1:31:02] tongue spoke in another language they
[1:31:05] were so quickened by the power of the
[1:31:07] resurrection of christ
[1:31:09] until they laid their hands they were so
[1:31:12] quickened with quickening power till
[1:31:14] they laid their hands on the sick and
[1:31:17] they got well it quickened your mortal
[1:31:20] body they were healed by laying on of
[1:31:23] their hands so he's telling us that it
[1:31:26] just wasn't a mental or a spiritual
[1:31:30] experience
[1:31:31] that the quickening power not only
[1:31:33] transformed your heart
[1:31:36] and your mind but it transformed your
[1:31:39] actions
[1:31:40] in other words you would you would
[1:31:42] recommend
[1:31:43] billy would call me and say brother
[1:31:45] david i'm i'm sick i say well billy i
[1:31:48] know a good doctor
[1:31:52] and that would be good and then maybe he
[1:31:55] said i went to that doctor but he wasn't
[1:31:58] able to help me i said well okay then i
[1:32:00] i know another doctor
[1:32:03] you know i've been quickened so now it's
[1:32:06] just not gonna be in word it's just not
[1:32:09] gonna be in in a philosophy but now it's
[1:32:13] actually quickened to where now it
[1:32:15] actually produces a mortal body work
[1:32:19] of laying on a hand
[1:32:21] or a praise and worship or or of giving
[1:32:25] show me your faith without your works
[1:32:28] and i'll show you my faith by my word so
[1:32:31] because it transformed just not from
[1:32:33] quickening their soul
[1:32:35] to where i say oh i feel good in my
[1:32:38] spirit i feel like i'm it's in my soul
[1:32:41] but it actually took my body and had my
[1:32:45] body produced spiritual works or a
[1:32:49] pattern of good works
[1:32:53] because it's just not left there
[1:32:55] so not only does it quicken your spirit
[1:32:59] oh i feel at peace
[1:33:01] i feel saved
[1:33:03] it's like the little boy that went to
[1:33:05] the
[1:33:07] just visit his brothers at the lumber
[1:33:09] camp
[1:33:10] and he said he said oh son you don't
[1:33:12] want to go up there when they find out
[1:33:14] you're a christian they'll really make a
[1:33:17] lot of fun of you
[1:33:19] oh oh i'm not worried mama
[1:33:21] so he goes up there and he comes back
[1:33:23] and his mother said how did it go
[1:33:26] up up there
[1:33:28] with uh all them lumberjacks and all
[1:33:31] them guys carrying on the way they carry
[1:33:33] on he said how did it go for you being a
[1:33:36] christian oh it went good mama they
[1:33:37] never found out
[1:33:44] that's having it on your mind
[1:33:47] and in your spirit
[1:33:49] but when it's quickened it doesn't just
[1:33:51] quicken this
[1:33:53] it actually quickens your outside
[1:33:57] experience
[1:33:59] and you know when i was a very young
[1:34:01] christian i remember i went to a coke
[1:34:03] machine
[1:34:04] at the job and i put in a quarter and
[1:34:07] that thing started spitting out quarters
[1:34:11] you know some guy said oh that's a slot
[1:34:13] machine
[1:34:14] you know and banged it and see if you
[1:34:16] get some more quarters out of there well
[1:34:18] i had this big handful of quarters in my
[1:34:20] hand well i brought it back into the
[1:34:22] office
[1:34:24] those guys are saying what what are you
[1:34:26] doing
[1:34:27] man we could all have cokes
[1:34:31] you know they all thought i was crazy i
[1:34:33] it wasn't even a a second thought to me
[1:34:38] you know like i was a new christian
[1:34:40] living those things and being free from
[1:34:43] all those things was just so much on my
[1:34:45] heart i didn't want to be touched by the
[1:34:47] world or the stains of the world the
[1:34:49] trouble is christianity's got too common
[1:34:52] to us and we let all those little things
[1:34:54] go by i'd never used to walk by a piece
[1:34:57] of paper on the ground
[1:35:01] that i wouldn't pick it up
[1:35:03] it was a consciousness like if it
[1:35:06] doesn't only quicken your your
[1:35:08] your
[1:35:09] heart in your
[1:35:11] but it quickens your mortal body it
[1:35:13] pushes it to a place that it actually uh
[1:35:17] goes in
[1:35:18] and and produces
[1:35:21] actions
[1:35:23] in your body
[1:35:26] that wouldn't normally be there
[1:35:29] you know okay i've seen it a lot of
[1:35:31] times even christians maybe you'll be
[1:35:33] walking somewhere and somebody'll bump
[1:35:34] into it and you'll throw your shoulder
[1:35:36] out
[1:35:37] a little bit you know like you're some
[1:35:40] sort of king kong
[1:35:43] see these are the things
[1:35:46] as long as we keep it in the spirit
[1:35:49] realm and as long as we keep it in the
[1:35:51] mental realm can never manifest him
[1:35:55] because the promise is is to deny that
[1:35:59] jesus christ has come in the flesh in
[1:36:02] other words you're denying that the
[1:36:04] quickening power has come in your flesh
[1:36:07] and jesus christ is manifesting himself
[1:36:10] in you through you by his word
[1:36:17] oh
[1:36:19] otherwise it's theology
[1:36:23] how many wants to go beyond theology
[1:36:28] we had an example
[1:36:32] in our day
[1:36:34] of a man that lived
[1:36:37] what he believed
[1:36:39] that's right
[1:36:42] okay so
[1:36:44] let's look as we're running through this
[1:36:46] this morning now notice paragraph 230.
[1:36:56] well we'll just kind of read down and
[1:36:57] see if we can start to if it comes to 29
[1:37:00] if it comes into you
[1:37:02] now you can say it so
[1:37:06] but if it be so
[1:37:08] these signs follow that you see
[1:37:13] it quickens your mortal body
[1:37:17] it'll quicken you
[1:37:18] you see what i we we just talked about
[1:37:20] there that's where he says it so that
[1:37:23] comes in
[1:37:24] these signs will be in your body they'll
[1:37:27] be in your life
[1:37:29] okay okay but you can say it is but if
[1:37:31] it's so it also quickens this body into
[1:37:36] total obedience to god's word
[1:37:39] now notice
[1:37:41] notice the
[1:37:43] quickening in the presence of god why
[1:37:47] why is this spirit wanna quicken you
[1:37:50] into the presence of god
[1:37:52] why it was the spirit of god that raised
[1:37:56] up jesus from the grave
[1:37:59] and the spirit of god i give
[1:38:02] unto them eternal life come from the
[1:38:05] greek word if you look it up
[1:38:08] zoe
[1:38:10] which moves it through you
[1:38:13] and then quickens even their mind
[1:38:19] now
[1:38:20] we want the the spirit of god is not
[1:38:25] it's going he's saying so don't don't
[1:38:27] miss the fact that it's also gonna
[1:38:29] produce
[1:38:30] uh
[1:38:31] if your flesh is gonna
[1:38:34] it's gonna manifest in your flesh also
[1:38:37] but he says it quickens your mind
[1:38:40] now the scripture says let this mind be
[1:38:43] in you that was in christ jesus
[1:38:47] so it's it's going to
[1:38:50] change
[1:38:52] or bring
[1:38:53] alive in you
[1:38:56] a completely different way of thinking
[1:39:04] something is actually going to happen
[1:39:08] in other words
[1:39:09] what comes through your five senses
[1:39:13] now
[1:39:14] you are totally
[1:39:16] perceiving that
[1:39:18] because you have a new mind
[1:39:20] it brought another mind to you another
[1:39:24] way of thinking
[1:39:26] that's why the battleground is where in
[1:39:29] the mind because satan is trying to get
[1:39:33] a hold of that mind because if he
[1:39:36] quickens
[1:39:37] in other words you are what you eat you
[1:39:40] manifest what you think
[1:39:45] so god's trying to come
[1:39:48] down and he's trying to say that i'm
[1:39:50] going to quicken your mind when you wake
[1:39:52] up in the morning you're not looking for
[1:39:54] a raise you're looking for a different
[1:39:56] kind of raise
[1:40:00] you're looking for a raise out of here
[1:40:06] you know he he know you're not just
[1:40:08] looking for an earthly job you're
[1:40:11] looking for what works would you have
[1:40:13] me to do
[1:40:14] so it it it changes their mind it
[1:40:18] quickens
[1:40:19] their mind
[1:40:22] and and that that's a beautiful thing
[1:40:26] because if you get trapped
[1:40:30] between these two worlds
[1:40:32] you can't serve two masters
[1:40:36] if if you don't
[1:40:39] understand especially in this hour
[1:40:42] and have this power of god's word
[1:40:47] quicken your whole mental understanding
[1:40:52] of this day in this hour to be able to
[1:40:55] recognize it
[1:40:57] you will start to be on the verge of
[1:40:59] insanity
[1:41:06] someone sent me something the other day
[1:41:09] and
[1:41:10] and i started to read it and i i just
[1:41:12] said like you know i can't take this
[1:41:13] stuff anymore
[1:41:16] it it burdens me how far men have gotten
[1:41:21] away from god
[1:41:24] the standard of christianity is so low
[1:41:32] that
[1:41:33] you you got to understand we can't think
[1:41:35] about it but you go back a hundred years
[1:41:38] they would arrest a woman
[1:41:41] and put her in jail
[1:41:44] that's right
[1:41:45] if she went down the street
[1:41:47] in her underclothes which is
[1:41:49] a whole lot more closed than anything
[1:41:51] they were today
[1:41:57] but it slipped
[1:41:58] so far
[1:42:00] you understand there's only one thing
[1:42:02] that's going to keep us
[1:42:04] in that if there's a quickening power
[1:42:07] from almighty god that comes down on our
[1:42:10] minds
[1:42:16] our minds
[1:42:18] our mental thought process has got to be
[1:42:21] brought alive so it's the thought
[1:42:23] process of the word not always a battle
[1:42:28] between what they say or what satan says
[1:42:31] or the news says and what the word says
[1:42:33] what the psychologist says and what
[1:42:36] propaganda says i don't want none of
[1:42:38] that stuff take all that away from me
[1:42:43] let the mind that was in christ be in me
[1:42:49] amen satan offered him all the kingdoms
[1:42:54] he didn't even look for a piece of it
[1:42:58] even moses
[1:43:02] he gave it all up
[1:43:04] why
[1:43:06] a mind was quickened in him
[1:43:09] that he all of a sudden his mind was
[1:43:11] changed he didn't see a mud dauber he
[1:43:14] didn't see a slave
[1:43:16] he didn't see nationality he didn't see
[1:43:19] upbringing he didn't see language he saw
[1:43:22] sons and daughters of god
[1:43:27] that's what he saw
[1:43:30] this world that tries to point to all
[1:43:32] this other stuff oh let the mind that
[1:43:35] was in christ be in me that i look upon
[1:43:38] every other man's needs more than i own
[1:43:45] that's the mind
[1:43:48] that's what he's got to quicken
[1:43:50] he's got to quicken the mind first
[1:43:55] what does it do if he quickens your
[1:43:57] spirit and you still think like him
[1:44:04] we always kid davey that his cat's a dog
[1:44:11] it wasn't a dog that had a puppy mind in
[1:44:13] it
[1:44:15] well that's what you'd be
[1:44:18] nebuchadnezzar what did he do he gave
[1:44:19] him a mind of the beast
[1:44:22] right
[1:44:24] when grew up things sat and ate grass
[1:44:29] let me tell you
[1:44:32] you
[1:44:33] i do
[1:44:36] i need the quickening power of god
[1:44:39] on my mind
[1:44:42] i need my mind
[1:44:44] transformed into the word of god i've
[1:44:48] got to get rid of all these all these
[1:44:51] conspiracy theories
[1:44:53] all these plans all these ideas i've had
[1:44:57] let let my think let this mind be in you
[1:45:01] that was in christ
[1:45:05] so it even quickened their mind
[1:45:09] now look
[1:45:10] how can you say
[1:45:13] that the spirit dwells in you
[1:45:17] that's a good question
[1:45:20] i want this answer
[1:45:23] how can you the spirit goes in
[1:45:25] though you've done everything that you
[1:45:28] thought was right
[1:45:32] here is your evidence whether you got it
[1:45:35] or not
[1:45:41] this is beautiful
[1:45:44] let's don't use this the way that we
[1:45:47] always use it oh you know if you've got
[1:45:50] if you believe the message
[1:45:52] i know a lot of people that are led of
[1:45:54] the spirit that don't know the message
[1:45:56] yet
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:02] i believe god's leading them to it
[1:46:05] amen amen
[1:46:10] you said
[1:46:11] whether you've got it or not if the
[1:46:13] spirit
[1:46:15] that was in christ is in you
[1:46:18] it also
[1:46:20] quickens you to the word
[1:46:22] another it makes it alive in you the
[1:46:28] word alive which is christ jesus
[1:46:33] it doesn't get you to quicken you to
[1:46:36] believe the way somebody else believes
[1:46:39] or a group of believers or the latest
[1:46:42] thing that's going to bring the church
[1:46:44] into the rapture
[1:46:48] you know how many doctrines and moves of
[1:46:50] the spirit that i've seen that's
[1:46:52] supposed to produce the rapture it's not
[1:46:54] produced by man
[1:46:59] there's only one thing that produces the
[1:47:01] rapture it's the same spirit that was in
[1:47:05] jesus christ god giving that to you and
[1:47:09] when he gives you that spirit he gives
[1:47:11] you rapture
[1:47:19] whether it quickens you to the word for
[1:47:21] he is the word
[1:47:24] in other words does it bring is does it
[1:47:26] bring you closer
[1:47:29] does is the love of god shed abroad in
[1:47:31] your heart by the spirit
[1:47:34] do you have a pattern of good works is
[1:47:37] the spirit that pleading you
[1:47:40] yeah
[1:47:41] does it cause confusion
[1:47:44] do you got gossip on your lips
[1:47:48] somebody does something and says
[1:47:50] something
[1:47:52] that's what i say if we call for women
[1:47:55] we call it gossip for men we call it
[1:47:58] backbiting
[1:48:00] i think we got a whole lot more
[1:48:01] backbiters than we do gossipers
[1:48:10] you can you see what i'm trying to say
[1:48:12] measure that spirit right there
[1:48:16] right on the spot
[1:48:18] is this spirit
[1:48:20] that it's affecting me
[1:48:24] that i want to talk
[1:48:28] that i want to judge
[1:48:30] that i want to criticize
[1:48:35] did you see you see what she was wearing
[1:48:39] oh did you hear something oh such and
[1:48:41] such made this promise to this person
[1:48:50] there's death in the camp
[1:48:55] how do you know you've got it
[1:48:57] does it lead you to the word does it
[1:49:00] lead you to compassion does it lead you
[1:49:02] to com pity oh i've got to hurry up
[1:49:05] i haven't even got to what i want to
[1:49:06] talk about
[1:49:10] it to you word for he is the word
[1:49:12] and if it's contrary
[1:49:15] and quickens you away from the word then
[1:49:18] it isn't the spirit of christ
[1:49:22] you understand it's not it's not
[1:49:25] something that you can write out formula
[1:49:27] over here and said i've done this it's a
[1:49:30] if it's a spirit
[1:49:32] and it's quick and
[1:49:33] it's on going every day
[1:49:38] every day you're presented and you say
[1:49:41] is this leading me away from christ or
[1:49:44] is it leading me to christ is it leading
[1:49:47] me to the word to act like christ or is
[1:49:50] it leading me away from the word and if
[1:49:52] it's leading you away from the word
[1:49:56] then you don't want any part of it
[1:50:03] but see once we think it's doctrine
[1:50:08] then we say oh i i know i believe in the
[1:50:10] message i can be just a big old gossip
[1:50:13] and i can condemn everybody and i i can
[1:50:15] put all the baptists in hell and all the
[1:50:18] methodists in hell you know there's only
[1:50:20] one person you have to worry about
[1:50:22] whether they're going to hell or not and
[1:50:24] that's you
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:31] that's right
[1:50:32] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:50:34] and trembling
[1:50:36] you decide what you want to live like
[1:50:39] and be like
[1:50:42] you've got a sure word
[1:50:45] amen
[1:50:47] he said
[1:50:48] so it's not
[1:50:50] it's not something you join
[1:50:54] it's it's in your mind
[1:50:57] it's a filter
[1:51:00] that
[1:51:02] a thinking man's filter the word of god
[1:51:05] filtering everything every day
[1:51:09] in your life
[1:51:13] he said
[1:51:14] if it isn't the spirit of christ
[1:51:18] cares what you've done until that moves
[1:51:21] you in the word
[1:51:25] i don't care what you've done
[1:51:27] until the spirit that's in you moves you
[1:51:31] into the word
[1:51:33] it's religion
[1:51:37] they have it up there so
[1:51:39] when i add my own comments you know the
[1:51:41] difference
[1:51:42] my sheep hear my voice
[1:51:44] and they shall live by every word
[1:51:47] every word
[1:51:49] i was talking on that
[1:51:51] the other day
[1:51:52] and then brother brown talks
[1:51:54] the story about the dream of his
[1:51:56] his mother had about the woman walking
[1:51:59] down the highway in the high heels i'm
[1:52:01] not going to go through all that but
[1:52:03] let's jump to paragraph
[1:52:05] 239.
[1:52:12] yeah and and the brothers talked about
[1:52:14] this yesterday and i'm going to make
[1:52:16] some comments on some of the things they
[1:52:18] said but
[1:52:21] one of the brothers brought up how
[1:52:22] serious this is
[1:52:26] you know
[1:52:27] that we get to the place that we think
[1:52:29] that
[1:52:31] we were hedged about
[1:52:34] and that's what they accused job of
[1:52:37] oh you're just hedged about
[1:52:39] god said okay i'll take down the hedge i
[1:52:42] know this man i know the integrity
[1:52:45] of his heart
[1:52:50] that's pretty good
[1:52:52] i don't want my heads taken down
[1:52:55] but listen
[1:52:56] she just obeyed everything but one word
[1:53:00] see everything but one word sure
[1:53:03] pentecostal woman can be saved
[1:53:06] sanctified and filled with the holy
[1:53:09] ghost
[1:53:10] and then fail
[1:53:14] why do you think he's saying that
[1:53:16] now listen and then fail
[1:53:20] you can't fail
[1:53:22] to move on with god's word god is moving
[1:53:29] he's dealing with hearts he's dealing
[1:53:31] with minds he's dealing with lives he's
[1:53:34] trying to take us and
[1:53:36] take this elect lady as the evil hour
[1:53:39] gets worsen
[1:53:43] to where god's got not going to be able
[1:53:45] to dwell with the spirits of men anymore
[1:53:52] and they're going to cross the day of
[1:53:53] judgment
[1:53:57] so he's still calling
[1:53:59] he's still restoring
[1:54:03] and and so you've got to get serious if
[1:54:06] you got the tv kick it out
[1:54:12] get rid of some of this stuff
[1:54:14] apply the token
[1:54:21] and that goes for me too
[1:54:25] and fail absolutely men shall not live
[1:54:29] by bread alone but every word that
[1:54:31] proceedeth
[1:54:32] word that precedeth
[1:54:34] see
[1:54:35] see she failed it
[1:54:37] and as i said
[1:54:39] see see she would have went on
[1:54:43] in all right but she failed to listen
[1:54:52] see she was on her way to heaven
[1:54:55] on this highway towards the gates and he
[1:54:59] said you can't go there in them shoes
[1:55:07] she was on her way
[1:55:10] and she would have made it
[1:55:13] but she didn't listen
[1:55:16] so she was spirit-filled she did
[1:55:18] everything
[1:55:20] she said i can walk in this road
[1:55:24] he says you can
[1:55:26] but you can't do it with them shoes
[1:55:33] and off she went
[1:55:36] and you know what happened
[1:55:37] it got narrower
[1:55:41] you see the statue of a perfect man it
[1:55:43] gets narrower
[1:55:49] you don't think this road's getting
[1:55:50] narrower
[1:55:52] yeah narrow is the way
[1:55:55] but broad is the way to destruction and
[1:55:58] many be on there that'll help you
[1:56:03] but she failed
[1:56:05] she failed to listen
[1:56:08] telling her
[1:56:09] what was ahead
[1:56:14] she failed to listen telling her what is
[1:56:17] ahead
[1:56:19] look at the spirit of god is telling us
[1:56:21] it's time not to be lukewarm
[1:56:29] time to get serious it's time to apply
[1:56:32] the token it's time to put prayer back
[1:56:35] in your life it's time to put reading
[1:56:37] the bible back in your life it's time to
[1:56:39] pick good works back in your life it's
[1:56:41] time to put the love and care of your
[1:56:43] brother's sisters back in your life
[1:56:46] it's time to bridle your tongues
[1:56:54] he wrote the gospel by his disciples
[1:56:58] apostles in doctrine of the apostles and
[1:57:01] prophets and so forth and they won't
[1:57:04] listen
[1:57:08] i think i'll play our portion tonight
[1:57:11] because i won't keep you too i'm just i
[1:57:13] got i'm just going to go another few
[1:57:16] paragraphs

[1:57:35] it's moving
[1:57:37] it's moving
[1:57:39] that's why you've got to understand
[1:57:40] denominational pentecostalism
[1:57:43] is a like a one-time anointing that
[1:57:46] you're stuck in
[1:57:47] this leadership of the holy spirit is
[1:57:50] god's quickening power it's going to

[1:58:06] for what you say don't build a fence
[1:58:08] don't build a creed don't build a
[1:58:10] doctrine don't build a religion because
[1:58:12] the spirit of god will lead you and
[1:58:14] guide you into all truth and
[1:58:15] righteousness which all the spirit of
[1:58:18] god is is jesus christ
[1:58:20] the same person in spirit form
[1:58:24] not a second person
[1:58:29] he says now notice this quickening zoe
[1:58:32] bringing the word
[1:58:34] the mind
[1:58:36] that was in christ
[1:58:38] was in you
[1:58:40] then
[1:58:41] this is what that spirit does oh
[1:58:44] let's
[1:58:45] sit on this just a second
[1:58:49] what's the quickening power going to do
[1:58:53] it's going to put the mind that was in
[1:58:57] christ in you
[1:59:00] now we're just going to we're just going
[1:59:02] to
[1:59:03] go on it if we maybe we could title this
[1:59:05] sermon the transformation of our mind
[1:59:10] okay that's what it's going to do it's
[1:59:12] going to it's going to put that mind
[1:59:15] that was in christ was then in you
[1:59:19] i'm trying to show you that
[1:59:26] that he's preached all this way
[1:59:28] and he's trying i'm trying to show you
[1:59:31] something i'm trying to i want to show
[1:59:32] you something i want to show you that
[1:59:35] now so he's going to say now listen to
[1:59:37] what i'm going to say to you in the next
[1:59:38] few minutes he went through this whole
[1:59:40] story and he said they don't listen
[1:59:49] how many times has something said and
[1:59:50] you go
[1:59:54] you're out of the service
[1:59:56] you're not connected with the anointing
[1:59:59] you're not connected with the preacher
[2:00:01] you're not connected with the word
[2:00:03] somewhere along the line you dropped out
[2:00:10] you just start to train yourself
[2:00:14] lock in
[2:00:17] i hate to use sports
[2:00:19] as an analysis
[2:00:21] but
[2:00:22] all these
[2:00:23] great athletes
[2:00:25] they call it don't they call it zoning
[2:00:28] out
[2:00:29] or zoning in
[2:00:31] they they they're locked in you ought to
[2:00:33] look at their face
[2:00:37] there's nobody in the world
[2:00:40] one thing going on
[2:00:43] amen
[2:00:45] the guys that can stay like that
[2:00:48] are those who are successful
[2:00:52] amen the guys who open their minds to
[2:00:55] every little thought every little idea
[2:00:57] every little distraction every little
[2:01:00] thing they can't focus they can't
[2:01:01] concentrate they don't know what to
[2:01:03] think they don't know what they're gonna
[2:01:05] do and they don't know the outcome
[2:01:13] it's time we know the outcome of what we
[2:01:16] say and what we do
[2:01:22] what time is it
[2:01:24] oh my goodness i'm sorry
[2:01:28] you can leave
[2:01:33] i gotta just do this another 30 minutes
[2:01:36] i mean this sermon is two and a half
[2:01:38] hours long
[2:01:40] and it's taken us
[2:01:43] eight weeks to get halfway through so
[2:01:46] we just can't say it like he says it
[2:01:50] he says when god raised jesus from the
[2:01:53] dead
[2:01:54] he raised you up
[2:01:56] also
[2:01:58] now he's going to tell us something
[2:02:00] let's just follow this through
[2:02:02] and also quickened
[2:02:05] to life
[2:02:06] with him
[2:02:08] you are now quickened to life
[2:02:11] although
[2:02:12] then you were but an attribute in his
[2:02:15] thoughts but god saw all in him
[2:02:21] at the finish
[2:02:22] when god looked down upon that body now
[2:02:27] and i i just thought this was wonderful
[2:02:29] brother tim shared this with us at the
[2:02:32] men's breakfast and if you can make
[2:02:34] those men breakfast there's only once a
[2:02:36] month you ought to come out
[2:02:39] but we were talking about the statue of
[2:02:41] a perfect man
[2:02:44] now
[2:02:46] we're all trying to become in that
[2:02:48] statue of a perfect man right
[2:02:51] but all of that is in him
[2:02:54] you understand none of that's coming
[2:02:56] from you
[2:02:57] you don't have faith in you it's a gift
[2:03:00] of god you don't have virtue or strength
[2:03:03] it's a gift of god all those things god
[2:03:06] has to give you
[2:03:10] so they're all in him
[2:03:14] so let's say you're on this ladder of
[2:03:16] life
[2:03:17] and you only get as far as temperance
[2:03:23] right
[2:03:25] but
[2:03:26] when he comes
[2:03:29] if all the farther you are as temperance
[2:03:32] he brings the rest of it
[2:03:34] with him
[2:03:38] that's what it says in
[2:03:41] philippians one and six he who begin the
[2:03:44] good work in you will perform it unto
[2:03:46] the end
[2:03:47] in other words he'll finish it
[2:03:52] you don't have to be sitting here saying
[2:03:53] oh i better get to the capstone
[2:04:00] no
[2:04:02] he'll finish it
[2:04:05] so you can't judge somebody for where
[2:04:07] they're at
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:11] you oh they're not this they don't have
[2:04:13] that he's got it
[2:04:18] he's got it
[2:04:19] and if you just happen to think that you
[2:04:22] know that they need it
[2:04:26] you know where you start working right
[2:04:28] get the beam out
[2:04:30] before you work on the sliver
[2:04:34] but he brings it
[2:04:36] he finishes the work he completes it if
[2:04:39] he started it i'll finish it
[2:04:44] it comes with him
[2:04:46] so
[2:04:47] so when he looked upon the body
[2:04:51] now this is so beautiful
[2:04:55] and maybe we'll get a little past this
[2:04:57] and that will be good
[2:04:59] the spirit left him
[2:05:04] in the garden of gethsemane
[2:05:11] now you didn't have
[2:05:14] anything but
[2:05:16] a man
[2:05:19] he was the son of god
[2:05:21] he was spotless else he couldn't have
[2:05:23] been a sacrifice
[2:05:25] but listen
[2:05:29] the spirit
[2:05:31] the spirit left him in the garden of
[2:05:33] gethsemane he had to die a man
[2:05:40] remember friends
[2:05:42] he didn't have to do that
[2:05:46] that was god
[2:05:49] god anointed that flesh
[2:05:52] which was human flesh
[2:05:55] and he didn't if
[2:05:58] he went up there as god
[2:06:00] he would have never died
[2:06:03] that kind of death can't kill god
[2:06:06] but he didn't have to do it
[2:06:09] now this is what i wanted to preach this
[2:06:11] morning
[2:06:13] just get into my sermon
[2:06:17] now remember
[2:06:19] now this is such a blessing to us this
[2:06:22] morning
[2:06:23] i i know i'm not going to be able to
[2:06:25] express it
[2:06:26] the way it means to me
[2:06:29] but remember
[2:06:32] when he went there
[2:06:34] with you in him
[2:06:40] see god had not separated the bride
[2:06:45] from
[2:06:46] the groom
[2:06:50] there's no bride
[2:06:52] there was no gentile bride
[2:06:54] that other church lived
[2:06:56] under the law of sin and death
[2:07:00] right that's where they live they were
[2:07:02] under the law
[2:07:03] of sin and death
[2:07:07] but now so he
[2:07:09] when he was there the bride wasn't
[2:07:11] separated yet
[2:07:14] so don't get hung up on yourself
[2:07:23] when he looked down upon the body of
[2:07:25] christ he saw both male and female
[2:07:30] so he saw you
[2:07:32] and him
[2:07:38] it was all redeemed in that one body see
[2:07:44] they are one
[2:07:46] same same word the same word that spoke
[2:07:50] of the groom speaks of the bride
[2:07:53] now think of that so he saw the bride in
[2:07:56] christ so all the scriptures that spoke
[2:07:59] of him
[2:08:00] spoke of you
[2:08:04] because they weren't separated yet
[2:08:08] and that's what he told us all that he
[2:08:10] is we are
[2:08:15] look it hasn't been separated well how
[2:08:18] can the bride come
[2:08:20] and fail to manifest everything that was
[2:08:23] promised of him
[2:08:27] so in other words the same scripture so
[2:08:29] if it was promised of him it was
[2:08:32] promised of us
[2:08:33] because you're a part of him everything
[2:08:36] that pertains to him pertains to you
[2:08:39] because you died there also
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:47] he more the chastisement
[2:08:49] he bore the stripes but you bore the
[2:08:52] benefits so when he died you died with
[2:08:55] him when he rose you rose with him
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:01] the only difference was you weren't
[2:09:03] separated out yet
[2:09:10] it was all completed in him
[2:09:13] but now he's got to separate her out
[2:09:19] right so the first adam was what
[2:09:22] a living soul
[2:09:24] and what came out of him eve
[2:09:26] a natural
[2:09:28] living soul
[2:09:30] the second adam was what a quickening
[2:09:33] spirit
[2:09:35] and what came out of him eternal life an
[2:09:38] eternal bride came out of him
[2:09:44] for the gift of god is what
[2:09:46] eternal life there's only one form of
[2:09:49] eternal life and that's god and he is
[2:09:52] the what
[2:09:55] so if
[2:09:57] this never was
[2:09:59] jesus
[2:10:02] and everybody following him it always
[2:10:05] was jesus and his bride
[2:10:11] she came out of she went into the ground
[2:10:14] and then she came out
[2:10:18] believers came out in justification they
[2:10:20] came out they came out until the last
[2:10:22] days
[2:10:24] glory
[2:10:26] so it's a quick so they were they were
[2:10:28] came under the law of sin and death
[2:10:31] but we come under the okay
[2:10:34] in romans we come under the law of
[2:10:35] liberty and life in christ jesus
[2:10:39] he said so
[2:10:41] he said now let's greet he says
[2:10:43] he says
[2:10:44] and the groom and he wouldn't be the
[2:10:47] bride
[2:10:48] and he did everything even to prove it
[2:10:51] by raising himself from the dead
[2:10:53] afterwards then don't the black have to
[2:10:57] do the same thing
[2:10:59] have to be exactly what the word said
[2:11:02] she would be in the last days so if he
[2:11:06] rose from the dead she's got to
[2:11:09] rise from the dead because when he rose
[2:11:12] you rose with him
[2:11:15] you have to do the same thing
[2:11:17] that's why he said when he rose you rose
[2:11:20] what are we scared of
[2:11:26] the only thing you're spared of is
[2:11:27] because you're not your life isn't
[2:11:30] bearing witness to the quickening power
[2:11:33] and you're in conflict
[2:11:38] you love the lord
[2:11:44] and you're trying to balance
[2:11:46] the love of god
[2:11:48] and the love of the world
[2:11:50] that's the curse
[2:11:52] of lady osea
[2:11:56] lukewarm
[2:12:00] let's just read a few more paragraphs
[2:12:03] and then your dinner will taste better
[2:12:05] than ever
[2:12:09] she'll have exactly what the word said
[2:12:12] she would be in the last day don't she
[2:12:15] have to return to malachi 4.
[2:12:21] i will restore
[2:12:23] what's he restoring well i'll just save
[2:12:26] that
[2:12:27] we'll just get moved read this
[2:12:29] don't the word
[2:12:32] don't the world have to be
[2:12:34] just exactly like it is
[2:12:40] what
[2:12:41] a
[2:12:41] mess
[2:12:47] isn't these things a perfect
[2:12:50] identification
[2:12:51] of the word of god made known to us
[2:12:56] he's making it known to you
[2:12:59] now think of it
[2:13:03] you haven't been separated out yet
[2:13:05] at calvary
[2:13:07] but now you're what
[2:13:10] being separated out
[2:13:12] and i want to
[2:13:14] end this morning
[2:13:16] with this thought
[2:13:19] look notice this
[2:13:21] but god saw the bride in the groom
[2:13:24] hallelujah
[2:13:25] see to save his wife like adam he had to
[2:13:29] go with her adam knew what he was doing
[2:13:32] he didn't know what she was doing but
[2:13:34] adam walked out with his wife
[2:13:36] and jesus took his wife's place
[2:13:39] and became sin for her
[2:13:42] remember he become you
[2:13:45] and stood your punishment
[2:13:47] that you might stand in his place
[2:13:58] what a love
[2:14:00] what a fellowship how can we deny it how
[2:14:03] can we do anything but love him friend i
[2:14:06] should stay on
[2:14:07] for hours but let's move on a little bit
[2:14:10] look the pentecostal experience today
[2:14:13] and the coming of the holy ghost in the
[2:14:15] last days as a promise is like the
[2:14:18] abstract to the title deed
[2:14:22] now the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:14:26] is one thing
[2:14:27] and now he's talking about an abstract
[2:14:30] being another thing
[2:14:33] now
[2:14:35] when
[2:14:36] when you
[2:14:38] uh when you heard the gospel
[2:14:43] and the word of god was preached to you
[2:14:45] and you heard you were a sinner and you
[2:14:47] felt convicted and you heard you've
[2:14:50] heard the news and you you heard about
[2:14:52] jesus dying on calvary and and you heard
[2:14:56] those things you said i believe that
[2:15:02] okay and you claim it
[2:15:05] as yours
[2:15:08] okay that's my promise
[2:15:11] that's uh i believe that that's my faith
[2:15:14] i believe there's a heaven i believe i'm
[2:15:16] going there that is a
[2:15:19] title
[2:15:23] okay so you've got that
[2:15:25] you believe it you've heard it you
[2:15:27] believed it and you lay claim to it as
[2:15:31] yours
[2:15:32] so you have a title
[2:15:36] that you've written
[2:15:38] that says
[2:15:40] this is my promise this is my land you
[2:15:43] have the title
[2:15:45] but what he's talking about for this age
[2:15:49] is something beyond a title
[2:15:54] it's beyond your faith
[2:15:58] but yet it is your faith
[2:16:03] he said
[2:16:04] he says now you you can get a title sure
[2:16:08] and you can get a title to a place but
[2:16:11] that still don't say it's yours so what
[2:16:14] happens when you just get the title
[2:16:18] i'm saved
[2:16:20] satan lays claim on that he says no
[2:16:22] you're not
[2:16:26] you did this
[2:16:27] you did that
[2:16:29] this is mine no no you're not you're not
[2:16:32] going
[2:16:35] and you're in a conflict
[2:16:40] because you've laid claim to it that
[2:16:42] it's yours
[2:16:44] but you can't take possession of it
[2:16:49] because the title alone don't give it to
[2:16:51] you
[2:16:52] so you're always battling with the flesh
[2:16:56] you're always fighting your desires
[2:17:00] everything that comes along turns your
[2:17:02] head
[2:17:03] you know what i mean your ears are just
[2:17:05] itching
[2:17:08] this is beautiful
[2:17:12] you've laid hold of it as if it's yours
[2:17:18] but the adversary now is contending for
[2:17:22] it
[2:17:26] so let's read listen what happens
[2:17:29] he says
[2:17:30] sure
[2:17:31] you can have you can have you can say
[2:17:34] it's yours no sir somebody way back
[2:17:36] yonders comes in and puts a claim on it
[2:17:40] so what does satan do he goes back
[2:17:42] yonder
[2:17:45] he's the accuser of the brethren so now
[2:17:48] he's laying claim to it
[2:17:52] he said no you don't have it
[2:17:54] you're
[2:17:55] still
[2:17:56] mine
[2:18:00] and he keeps producing evidence
[2:18:05] because you've just got a title
[2:18:11] so you got
[2:18:17] you've got to have a title
[2:18:19] oh you don't have nothing
[2:18:21] but you understand god's doing something
[2:18:24] amen
[2:18:25] this is something that god's doing
[2:18:27] listen
[2:18:29] amen
[2:18:30] remember the seals
[2:18:33] and he opened the book
[2:18:35] what was that all about what did man
[2:18:38] lose
[2:18:39] they lost the title
[2:18:42] right
[2:18:43] and nobody could open the book
[2:18:45] but he came and opened the book
[2:18:48] now he was the possessor of the title d
[2:18:54] he had the original
[2:18:58] which was the abstract the original what
[2:19:01] was really written in the lamb's book of
[2:19:04] life
[2:19:05] he had it
[2:19:07] he's the only one that can what
[2:19:10] give it
[2:19:14] look he said so so he says
[2:19:18] he says but somebody back yonder can
[2:19:20] come and put a claim on it but when you
[2:19:23] get an abstract
[2:19:28] that shows that everything that's ever
[2:19:31] against it strike off
[2:19:33] plumb back from the foundation so in
[2:19:36] other words an abstract
[2:19:39] is there's a piece of property and all
[2:19:41] of a sudden you come in and you take
[2:19:43] this piece of property
[2:19:45] and you define it
[2:19:47] you say this corner to this corner to
[2:19:51] this corner to this corner
[2:19:53] that's when it's created
[2:19:58] the original
[2:20:00] description of that property
[2:20:03] its original creation is called the
[2:20:06] abstract it was abstracted
[2:20:11] or taken
[2:20:13] the original abstract was you because
[2:20:17] you were taken from him
[2:20:21] that's the original
[2:20:24] abstract
[2:20:26] so now
[2:20:27] that with the title deed just holding
[2:20:30] the promise
[2:20:32] he can come and tell you you weren't
[2:20:34] part of the original
[2:20:36] but when the abstract comes
[2:20:39] when the quickening power comes
[2:20:42] when the same spirit that was in him
[2:20:44] comes it takes you all the way back to
[2:20:48] your original existence
[2:21:01] plum back to the foundation
[2:21:04] it's not it's
[2:21:06] that's why so many of us go through so
[2:21:08] much trouble
[2:21:10] we're hanging on to the abstract
[2:21:13] i mean we're hanging under the title
[2:21:17] ask him for the abstract
[2:21:20] amen
[2:21:21] ask him for the spirit
[2:21:23] that goes with the land
[2:21:26] you're trying to hold a
[2:21:28] piece of land in another kingdom hold
[2:21:32] your kingdom land in his kingdom
[2:21:34] my kingdom's not of this world you are
[2:21:37] not of this world
[2:21:41] we got to quit trying to fit in
[2:21:46] can i have
[2:21:49] 15 more minutes
[2:21:51] and if i'm a liar pray for me
[2:21:58] so when a man believes the word
[2:22:01] that's his title
[2:22:04] okay but satan
[2:22:06] he's always trying to steal that from
[2:22:08] you
[2:22:11] it causes us to backslide
[2:22:14] it causes us to doubt
[2:22:16] we've never settled it
[2:22:19] you understand this is the age
[2:22:23] of restoration
[2:22:26] malachi 4. remember we just let it
[2:22:28] through malachi 4 he comes back and he
[2:22:32] gives you
[2:22:34] the abstract he gives you the eternal
[2:22:38] life
[2:22:39] that you
[2:22:40] possessed
[2:22:41] with him
[2:22:43] in the beginning
[2:22:46] now you're not believing it
[2:22:57] i hope this isn't shocking
[2:23:01] but i believe this message a long time
[2:23:03] with the
[2:23:04] with the title
[2:23:06] but i just think a few months ago
[2:23:10] that i got my abstract
[2:23:15] i mean it's something like i can't even
[2:23:17] comprehend
[2:23:20] the battle is gone
[2:23:23] the temptation's there because that's
[2:23:25] what he is
[2:23:28] you know what i mean but i don't got to
[2:23:29] put him in my pocket
[2:23:34] it's it's it's over
[2:23:38] it's finished
[2:23:44] but let's just read this
[2:23:47] i mean i i i've been
[2:23:49] i i've been in this
[2:23:51] two weeks
[2:23:54] just everything ties together
[2:23:57] how he's brought us back why he took
[2:24:00] this back to the beginning why he told
[2:24:02] us where we were what the brother
[2:24:04] branham's message was the only message
[2:24:07] that held the abstract
[2:24:12] it was the only word that brought the
[2:24:16] spirit that brought you back to your
[2:24:19] original
[2:24:20] creation
[2:24:26] amen you say well i what happens if i
[2:24:28] only got the title hang on to it
[2:24:32] he's got the rest of it
[2:24:37] right if you've just got faith you hang
[2:24:40] on to faith and tell virtues at it and
[2:24:43] it conveys you just saying you hang on
[2:24:44] to it till patience is added and
[2:24:47] knowledge is added and you just keep
[2:24:49] hanging on and he keeps adding and
[2:24:51] adding an edit and one day he caps it
[2:24:54] off
[2:24:58] he gives you that love he gives you that
[2:25:01] spirit
[2:25:02] you the struggle goes away
[2:25:04] you can actually say
[2:25:06] i'm risen
[2:25:12] because he lives
[2:25:14] i live also
[2:25:20] the suffering doesn't bother you
[2:25:23] you know
[2:25:26] that
[2:25:26] that
[2:25:27] he
[2:25:28] has
[2:25:29] finally seals you and tells you i've got
[2:25:33] eternal life we we work too much on it
[2:25:37] as being a baptism
[2:25:42] it's beyond the baptism
[2:25:45] do you understand
[2:25:46] if he
[2:25:47] had you in his thinking
[2:25:50] you will be there
[2:25:53] nothing can take you out of the book of
[2:25:55] life
[2:25:59] the abstract's yours
[2:26:03] don't just settle
[2:26:05] for the title
[2:26:07] take it all the way back
[2:26:09] tell them that's right i just don't want
[2:26:11] the promises that that say that this
[2:26:14] land's mine i just don't want the
[2:26:16] description of the land i i just don't
[2:26:19] want to know what the borders of the
[2:26:21] kingdom are and all i can do i want to
[2:26:24] take full possession and i want it to be
[2:26:28] mine
[2:26:32] now
[2:26:32] listen too many people with the title
[2:26:36] deed say he possesses it
[2:26:43] he's the possessor of healing he's the
[2:26:45] possessor of forgiveness he's the
[2:26:47] possessor he's the possessor he's the
[2:26:50] possessor but if you were in him
[2:26:53] everything that he is you are no longer
[2:26:56] is he the possessor but you're the
[2:26:59] possessor
[2:27:00] [Music]
[2:27:04] why because he gave you the same spirit
[2:27:07] that was in him
[2:27:10] [Applause]
[2:27:13] you know why the world keeps them at
[2:27:15] calvary
[2:27:19] because they don't understand the bride
[2:27:20] being separated you know why they don't
[2:27:23] understand the bride being separated
[2:27:25] they didn't listen
[2:27:30] malachi 4 5 came to restore
[2:27:35] back the abstract to the church
[2:27:52] that clock's
[2:27:56] wrong now
[2:27:58] oh
[2:28:02] okay so it takes you plum back
[2:28:04] to the foundation
[2:28:07] giving you what was yours what you
[2:28:09] always had see as a sinner we're always
[2:28:12] struggling
[2:28:15] but if you get the abstract it says wait
[2:28:17] a minute
[2:28:21] i i've always been
[2:28:30] i'm a part of the whole expression of
[2:28:32] god
[2:28:36] me and him are one
[2:28:38] so what he does with the abstract he had
[2:28:41] all the abstract in him
[2:28:44] so we looked at him having the book
[2:28:47] and we said he's everything i need he's
[2:28:50] everything i need
[2:28:51] but now you've got to understand you're
[2:28:54] his bride
[2:28:57] so he doesn't just want
[2:29:00] to be the one that possesses everything
[2:29:04] he wants you to possess
[2:29:06] what he has
[2:29:08] so he opens the book
[2:29:11] reveals how satan has kept it from us
[2:29:14] how he's kept us all through these ages
[2:29:18] until in this last hour he can finally
[2:29:22] return the abstract back to the believer
[2:29:26] and they too become the sons and
[2:29:29] daughters of god
[2:29:31] doing the same thing he did
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:41] now listen to how beautiful it gets
[2:29:44] next paragraph
[2:29:47] and when a man has said that he believes
[2:29:50] the word
[2:29:51] and then when the holy ghost comes
[2:29:54] it's the abstract
[2:29:56] to
[2:29:57] the title
[2:30:01] and
[2:30:02] gives you
[2:30:04] permission
[2:30:09] i am what he is
[2:30:13] the abstract gives me position
[2:30:16] permission to lay my hands on the sin it
[2:30:19] gives me permission to cast out devils
[2:30:22] it gives me positions to preach the
[2:30:24] gospel it gives me position
[2:30:30] oh we had a ministry that did everything
[2:30:33] for us
[2:30:34] but once you get the abstract you are
[2:30:37] christ
[2:30:38] [Applause]
[2:30:43] you're anointed
[2:30:45] you say how can it be because you were
[2:30:48] in him at calvary
[2:30:51] what's he been doing he's been
[2:30:52] separating her out until this last day
[2:30:56] through malachi 4 5 that it restores
[2:31:00] back the abstract to the believer and
[2:31:03] they become true
[2:31:05] sons and daughters of god just as he's
[2:31:07] the son and daughter of god
[2:31:11] and now you've got permission
[2:31:18] the title don't give you permission
[2:31:22] you got to ask
[2:31:25] you've got to ask
[2:31:32] when you go home you call
[2:31:35] you call
[2:31:38] you know i don't call my mother and ask
[2:31:40] her if i can open my refrigerator
[2:31:52] i'm commissioned
[2:31:58] when you go into that upper room
[2:32:00] you're going to get the abstract
[2:32:04] and with that abstract you go into all
[2:32:06] the world
[2:32:07] you preach the gospel you lay hands on
[2:32:09] the sick you cast out devils
[2:32:15] i'll lead you and guide you
[2:32:17] into all truth
[2:32:20] and righteousness
[2:32:23] he says
[2:32:24] you got permission
[2:32:25] when you have the abstract that every
[2:32:28] bit that belongs every bit of that
[2:32:32] belongs to you
[2:32:34] and everything is on it belongs to you
[2:32:39] amen
[2:32:40] and that gives us the abstract when the
[2:32:43] holy ghost comes upon this title deed
[2:32:48] that god saw
[2:32:50] back yonder for the foundations of the
[2:32:52] world and put
[2:32:54] its name on the lam
[2:32:57] on the book of life and was born through
[2:32:59] men and women
[2:33:01] and i could just preach on this whole
[2:33:03] paragraph
[2:33:04] for a long time but i won't
[2:33:06] man and woman and subject to sin and
[2:33:10] guilt of sin but when i believed on it i
[2:33:13] received the deed
[2:33:18] you see when i believed on it i received
[2:33:21] the deed
[2:33:24] now
[2:33:26] baptism of the holy spirit as we know it
[2:33:28] is part of the deed
[2:33:33] what this message brings us
[2:33:35] is the abstract
[2:33:41] the description
[2:33:44] of the original property
[2:33:47] boundaries it's creation
[2:33:50] all that's in it is in the abstract
[2:33:56] you believe it's there
[2:34:00] but now he returns the abstract
[2:34:03] to you
[2:34:04] you receive
[2:34:06] he says you believe it you receive the
[2:34:08] deed but when the holy ghost comes it's
[2:34:12] the abstract that everything against me
[2:34:15] whether my mother done it my father done
[2:34:18] it my grandfather done it he said like
[2:34:20] the little epileptic child i paid for a
[2:34:22] few minutes ago comes through the
[2:34:24] grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon
[2:34:28] the child he said but the abstract has
[2:34:30] come and it's all
[2:34:32] struck off
[2:34:34] so if everything struck off
[2:34:37] what are you returning back to
[2:34:42] you're returning back to the original
[2:34:45] amen
[2:34:51] why are we
[2:34:53] why aren't we going there
[2:34:56] because this is the call
[2:34:59] of the spirit
[2:35:03] return back to the original
[2:35:05] the call is there
[2:35:08] people think they're
[2:35:09] it's like man always does they always
[2:35:12] want to manifest it in the flesh they
[2:35:14] think it might be a shout they think it
[2:35:16] might be a run but it's beyond that
[2:35:20] you understand it's individual
[2:35:22] it comes in sight it's finally settled
[2:35:25] you're not working for your salvation
[2:35:27] anymore there's nothing laid to the
[2:35:30] charge of god's elect
[2:35:33] this he's only the accuser of the
[2:35:35] brethren but hear me there is nothing
[2:35:39] laid to the charge of god's elect
[2:35:45] when you get this
[2:35:48] it doesn't i don't some people come from
[2:35:50] broken homes some people don't know who
[2:35:52] the real daddy and mother is that that
[2:35:55] was all the questions
[2:35:58] under the title
[2:36:00] indeed
[2:36:02] but when the abstract comes
[2:36:04] he identifies you beyond your
[2:36:06] grandparents did you hear what he said
[2:36:09] beyond what your mother did
[2:36:12] so your mother had you out of wedlock it
[2:36:15] goes beyond come on
[2:36:19] it goes beyond them
[2:36:22] all of that's thrown away
[2:36:28] it takes you back
[2:36:30] to the book of life
[2:36:36] so many people
[2:36:39] and here's all preachers trying to fix
[2:36:41] your situation and deal with it and make
[2:36:45] excuses and
[2:36:46] it don't matter
[2:36:48] when he gives it to you
[2:36:51] it don't matter
[2:36:54] you've got permission
[2:36:58] you've got permission to claim your
[2:36:59] children
[2:37:00] you've got position to claim your mother
[2:37:03] you've got permission to claim all
[2:37:05] things you have permission to think the
[2:37:07] way he thinks you know how he thought he
[2:37:10] gave his life for the whole world that
[2:37:12] all men should be saved it's not my
[2:37:14] father's will that any man should perish
[2:37:20] you know
[2:37:22] church
[2:37:23] god's wanting
[2:37:26] to
[2:37:27] give us
[2:37:29] that
[2:37:31] sold out
[2:37:32] abstract
[2:37:34] it it's you've had the title
[2:37:37] that's why we're here
[2:37:39] but you understand it's not
[2:37:42] it's not like you got to have it now it
[2:37:44] doesn't matter it's in him what he is
[2:37:47] doing in this last day this last hour
[2:37:51] this last move of the bride he is
[2:37:53] distributing
[2:37:55] the abstract deed to each individual
[2:37:59] bride member that they have the same
[2:38:03] power and resurrection in them that he
[2:38:07] had
[2:38:09] and it's settled
[2:38:11] amen
