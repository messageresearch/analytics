Description:
Choice a Great thing - The Unwritten Law |
Sunday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
February 4, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you as we bring word to our church thank you put it in his pocket amen Shalom God bless you uh we may take our seats for a little while I want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and in the house of the Lord there is healing in the house of the Lord there is breakthrough amen uh I want us to stand for the reading of the word and then we quickly get into the word of God Amen uh can we stand on our feet it's a privilege to stand before you once again uh and I want to appreciate our pastor Pastor David for giving me this opportunity trusting that I will be a blessing to you amen by the time we read the scripture you should be familiar with my accent let's open our Bibles to Matthew chapter number 6 and verse 9 and turn Matthew chapter number 6: 9 and 10 and we are so delighted when we come into the house of the Lord when we see people come because The Gospel is not meant for chairs and benches it is meant for human beings so it is always an encouragement when we see people to speak to may God God bless you for coming and we don't take that lightly Matthew chapter number 6:9 the Bible says after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven Matthew chapter 7 and verse 7 am I too fast the Bible says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that ask receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knth it shall be opened and what Manner there is of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil uhhuh know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him may God bless the reading of the word uh one more scripture Deuteronomy chapter number 30: 19 sorry about that Deuteronomy chapter number 30: 19 if you are this shout amen I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I've set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that thou both thou and thy seed may live may God bless the reading of the word shall we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this word we ask that you anoint it Lord may you hide me in the shadow of your cross take me aside and speak unto your children in Jesus name amen amen we may take our seats I'm going to speak on a little topic um or a subject that I called Choice a great thing Choice a great thing under the subtitle an unwritten law Among Us I got it from the uh the message choosing of a bride so we're going to be talking about choice just in line uh with what the pastor was talking about the law of the seed in the morning just a little bit of some continuation and I believe that I'll be a blessing to you amen I'll preach under 40 minutes if I exceed 40 minutes just raise your hand at the back so choice is a law of God it's not written anywhere maybe sections or quotes and so forth so uh choice is the ability of choosing that you were given by by God even though it's Unwritten but there's no code or Constitution anyway but it affects our lives in a daily basis so consciously we make choices and unconsciously we make choices we don't live in a day without making some form of choice are we together as you are sitting there the dress the suit you are putting on um I I assume that that's not the only dress that you have when you walked into your wardrobe this morning or this afternoon or evening when you chose that one or selected that one you have made a choice when you were driving to come to this place here in Bedford maybe the route that you chose or to the road that you used to come here there could have been another way that you use sometimes but when you came and pled on that one you have made a choice are we together so choice is something that we do day in day out but what I want you to lead you to today is the choices that we make have consequences some of the choices that we make put us in consequences of who we are today so the choice that you make affect your yesterday it affects your today and it affect your tomorrow so when we are growing up we get to a stage called adolescent stage it's a stage of self-discovery that's why you hear some folks saying you don't tell me what to do leave me and I want to make my own my own decision are we together give me some Grace to make my own decision so it is inherent in man to always want to make decision or to have freedom to make our decision and our God understands that but there's something that I want you to understand that you making a choice by by yourself is actually dis complimentary to your makeup or it's dis complimentary to your creation you are not designed by Your Capacity to choose by yourself and be correct are we together brother Bram says you can choose to come to church and you can choose to hear the word get whatever you want and be blessed and go home or you can choose to sit there and sleep while the preaching is being made so it's about the choice so the Bible says in the beginning God placed men on free moral urgency Hallelujah which is the right to make choices or the right to for him to choose whatever he wants so free moral urgency is the ability to make choices without being interfered with whether Divine or physical so you can take your decisions and do what you want are we to together but there was a reason as to why God gave men that right so everything you see here on Earth today has its origin Way Before Time way back in eternity that is why our lives whatever we do whatever is happening in our lives every day there are no accidents in it so in eternity God had two things he wanted to achieve brother branam says at the time of this discussion God wasn't even God we can call him Elohim the one who Exist by himself and he was just alone to himself but he says but inside of him was a desire Hallelujah to be God the meaning of God means an object of worship by this time there was nobody to worship him he was he he was no subject and he has no worshippers but in him was a desire to be God and also in him was a desire to be known Beyond being God because inside of him were other abilities are we together so if we only know him as God and not in his other abilities that it then it means he will be so distant in relationship to us can somebody say amen amen but there's a problem here so these abilities of God by which you wanted to be known cannot take place in eternity because eternity is perfect are we together so God is building a platform here to eat his cake but he also wants to have it back he wants to be known as God and he also wants to be known Beyond being God what are these abilities brother Bram he says we can call them attributes for Spiritual language right are we together he said inside of God was an attribute to be a Healer a deliverer a savior and what else a redeemer so with all these abilities in him if everything remains perfect there will never be any need of these attributes am I speaking to somebody here so we are still in eternity here we have not come to time yet so for you to understand the introduction of Satan into the program it was not accidental because if it was accidental then God is not in control of all factors of life and the one who cannot be in control of factors of life is not qualified to be my God this is why after he finished all the thoughts he designed a program to bring it to pass that's why he created Angels Heavenly beings and then they started worshiping holy holy unto the Lord so his desire to be God has been achieved because they are now worshippers but some of these things could not take place in eternity are we together because eternity is perfect that is why when Lucifer became contaminated by iniquity the Bible says there was there was no more SP space for him up there he couldn't continue his turn up in heaven that's why he was thrown down because eternity is perfect Hallelujah so what did God do God created a loop out of Eternity I know there's a lot of it Brothers here and I know they can understand me better with what I'm about to say now so the IT people can say now they can say let's create a program and we can say this thing and that thing now in this program we want to make a presentation and they can say okay some people can do a critique to this same program that we are creating and say what if this happens uh what if that happens so the IT people say okay we never thought about it so but we are not going to cancel the entire program uh and start writing all over again so what we do we create what we call a loop out of the original program to take care of that matter and introduce it back to the program God was the first IT specialist God was the first programmer and he's still the first software developer can somebody say Amen so in his own case he has nobody to tell him he knows what is and he knows what he wanted to do friends I'm telling you the story of your life so God created a loop that is called time then we started hearing the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth Hallelujah God existed before the beginning but time was just a loop out of the Eternal program to demonstrate his thoughts and abilities Hallelujah so that the such the days of of demonstrations are over time will blend back into eternity Hallelujah so nothing is out of ker friends and nothing has been out of ker it's all God furthering his program Hallelujah so on Earth he brought forth all manner of creation and the last thing he brought forth a son now when he brought forth the son the sun was like a scoop out of out of him and that's what made him a son and braam says his manner of being brought up presented him as a an original creation so it is impossible for an original creation to create a condition that will make other attributes necessary because Adam came on Earth as God hallelujah when God gives birth he gives birth to God by the law of reproduction let every seed bring forth after its own human being gives birth to humans and God gives birth to God that is is why we need another birth Hallelujah and you can only be reborn because there's a gene of God inside of you Hallelujah and your new birth is the quickening of that seed gem that will start forming Christ in you come on Clap Your Hands for Jesus Hallelujah I feel good right here I have 25 minutes so God brought forth this man and called him an original creation because he came out of God now the process of his coming this man can never sin he can never create a condition of these attributes to be manifested so God decided to bring forth his wife the way he brought forth his son Hallelujah all to come to pass so when he brought forth this man brother Bram says in order for this man to be successible to the four or to be accessible to the four he gave him the gift or this privilege or this right they call free moral agency the ability to make choices without being interfered with so in order for this woman to be able to bring the four because Adam accepted it but brother Bram says he never fell that's why the Bible says she was not deceived he was not deceived but it was he she if who was deceived so God created that woman and brought her in a way that she should take deception it was not by accident you can stud you can study marriage and divorce uh books maybe studying paragraph 152 on brother Bram says he brought it even with some features which he God in his Holiness cannot put in her are we together because those features are pervasion features does and that's why she doesn't look like other females in creation as a matter of fact brother Bram says Satan gave a shape that is why Godly sisters don't get too conscious of their shape Godly sisters don't spend time in the mirror looking at their body are we together I hope I'm not being offensive if I'm being offensive forgive me but this is the word of God hallelujah God sisters don't spend time checking to say you know because brother Bram says if you do that you are exhibiting features of a fallen nature Bram says her beauty her shape her sex control was not handed to her by God all those things were there for the purpose of being in a shape to bring a for that is why when the devil who knows the principles of Life came into serpent and serpent knew who to go to in the garden are we together so the coming of serpent into the Garden or in the picture incarnating Satan was not also by accident that's why brother branam says when when Satan brought to pass that which was necessary to the purpose of God brother it's all God's program Hallelujah even Satan is being used to achieve God's purpose Hallelujah Satan is not powerful as you ascribe him he's just a two and one of these days hallelujah he Hallelujah one of these days you will find out that he's only being used and he will soon be be dumbed like a trash Hallelujah so H now God must put Adam in a position so that the choice ability can now take place so we see serpent is here serpent was there Eve was there so the serent could talk could relate even his blood could mix with human being and cause reproduction God did all these things for a purpose are we together so when God finished all this he went up into glory and then brother branam says he gave him that ability to choose by himself knowing by that he would fall right so when you are boasting around saying this is my right this is my right be careful you are creating a platform for failure because I tell you that choice ability is dis compliment to your makeup that's why the Bible called you a lamp Hallelujah that's the makeup of the Bride he called you a sheep a sheep has no right a sheep depends on the shepherd to lead him Hallelujah so here is God throwing a free moral aggen to you you must know that there's something such suspicious so don't ever glory in that R sir are we together if you have wisdom don't look at your parents and say don't talk to me like that when you do that you are exhibiting wrong symptoms brother Bram says you are exhibiting the character of a fallen nature that's why in the seals brother Bram says when we are redeemed we no longer want our ways we were created to be led in the message looking unto the Unseen brother Bram says he made a flat statement he says it might look rude but he says a man must not think by himself are we together because the Bible says let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you so if the mind of Jesus be in you let it do the thinking are we together that's why if okay so all these things were God's Divine calculation so that the four can take place or these uh attributes can be made necessary to take place so sepan and Eve Cross themselves so when if fell nothing has happened to the Earth something terrible happened to the Earth only after Adam became involved amen are we together if Adam was not involved Eve May perish alone and the Earth could have continued in Perfection but then there was a reason why God gave him ad that ability to choose so God folded his arms in heaven and turned his back and waited for his son to decide and brother Bram says God knew that by that he would fall are we together because the the choice or that choosing that he made was to demonstrate his attributes Hallelujah so free moral urgency the choice that was given in the beginning was designed designed to make you fall because ordinarily In Yourself by yourself you are not designed to choose correctly you are not designed to make a choice and be correct that is why we read Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 19 it says I place before you life and death that's free moral urgency blessing and cursing please put that verse uh Deuteronomy 30: 19 let's read it together I call Heaven let's read it together I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I've said before you life and death blessing and curing stop there so this is what we call free moral agents the ability for you to choose Hallelujah so and then he says therefore choose life who is now choosing now for you that's God are we together so he say that's uh that's why when we read it says I choose um I place before you death life and death blessing and cursing uh so in other words God is telling you to choose but in the next line that part it says choose life God whispered to tell you what to do you saw God God wants to influence your choice because if he leaves you to choose yeah you are going to choose death you are going to choose curse that's why God says choose life choose life so God wants to influence your choice Hallelujah Because by the convention of free moral agents he shouldn't have allowed you to choose if you are his own you don't have that right that you think you have that's right are we together that's why brother brandham says in in the message God of this evil age he says God is not obligated to to teach Ken's children Revelation he's not obligated to teach them his will they can have a free fall are we together but free moral urgency is not for the seeds of God because the design of it from the beginning it was to bring a fall so tonight you are going to live here with no no longer my will with no longer my way we are going to say I surrender all are we together so when Adam made that choice don't forget it was only after he made that choice that's when God came down God wasn't sleeping he wasn't lost in the program when everything was happening are we together but he designed it in a way to make those attributes necessary so that those attributes can be made necessary Hallelujah that's why in heaven God when he created angels they'll just be saying you know when we go to heaven some the Angels may not be able to join us in certain songs because the angel are just singing Holy Holy unto the Lord holy holy 24/7 but to us when we go to heaven we say Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound Hallelujah because God wants a worship with a sense of appreciation are we together because the angels are just saying holy holy holy but when I go to heaven I say I was once lost but now I am found that's a worship with a sense of appreciation hallelujah amen so we need police today because of the choice of Adam we need hospitals today because of the choice of Adam violence is everywhere at more you just hear someone shot somebody it's because of the choice of Adam but let's not dwell so much on Adam because Adam is gone this is your day brother Bram says in the message by faith Moses he says today you are what you are because of the choices that you are making can you find that that's 58072 M paragraph E31 brother Ram says it may be this morning of course this evening that there will be men and women sitting here that will make your final Choice andam says you are what you are today because several years ago you chose to be who you are now brother for a minute look at yourself to say who am I what am I whatever your conclusion is it's a product of now it's something that you CHS several years ago are we together if you want to be a medical doctor in my country you go to Primary School from grade one to grade seven that's seven years right and then from there you go to uh to a secondary school where you do probably we call it grade 8 to grade 12 or we call it from one to from six that's six more years then when you are done with that you go to do med you move and start doing sciences and when you start doing that you move and you go for another seven years so the day you get a degree to become a doctor was not the choice day that decision was probably decided 20 years ago are we together this year we are moving into the new building the day of the dedication of the new building is not the day that the pastor made a choice it's a decision he probably made several months or years ago are we together so uh braam says 5 years from today you may be a missionary 5 years from today you may be a renowned Christian or 5 years today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decisions he says 5 years from today you may be cleaning speedom in the barroom 5 years from today you may be a prostitute on the street are we together don't say it's not possible you've seen people who have jumped under anointing saying amen some of them are now attacking the message of the hour let me make this statement stay away from those Sinners there are people who say preach brother but don't quot brother Branham they are all over the world whether black yellow or white whatever the case might be make your own choice believe what you believe and you shall prosper are we together so some people take a long or long around the message are we together because you can never be in the message and depart brother Bram says many is an attraction within the range of the message they have stayed so long the next thing they their sisters are wearing trousers pant and so forth and you wonder what their value have been all these years Hallelujah and when that happens don't think it just happens that day it's cataloges of areas areas of prayer areas of Disobedience areas of studying the word areas of playing church and areas not knowing why you are here and when those things they build up to your level where your system can no longer handle it and you crash into backness 5 years from today 5 years past 5 years tomorrow it's not late for you to make the right choices do you love him this evening even though our choices are unconscious yes yet effective affecting our lives in this case the prophet has an advice for us how many wants to hear the advice of the prophet in the message by faith Moses paragraph e32 uh that's 58 07 to0 M the morning service paragraph e32 brother Bram says my advice to you is when you are making choices don't look at the Modern things around you are we together don't look at the popularity the glamour that could be he says choose rather by faith choice is a battle between sight and Faith sight is seeing through human eye but faith is seeing through God's eye choose by faith and faith is a revelation in the message God's provided place of worship brother Bram says in paragraph 46 he says it must be God's choosing yes he says it can't be ours he says we have no choice coming he has already chose it now what God chooses is right he says I can choose wrong you can choose wrong but God cannot choose right so brother sister hand over your choice to God Hallelujah in the message does God ever change his mind paragraph um 65 he says it's best to have God's will that's what he taught us he says th thy will be done thy kingdom come he says we must submit ourselves to the will of God and to his word brother bam says don't question it he says believe it he says don't try to find a way around it he says just take it the way it is so here we must submit ourselves to two things right his will and his word are we together the Bible is the word of God that's right are we together the message of the hour is the will of God let me repeat that the Bible is the word of God that's right but the message of the hour is the will of God in the time of Noah Noah was was told to build an ark that was the word of God for that hour and the will of God at that time and because he said there was going to come a flood so he built that Ark it was the word of God and the will of God in that day or in that in that day right but today if you come and say brother Caleb this is the word of God God told Noah to build an ark and you take your Ark here it's still the word of God but it is no longer the will of God so you you can come and and you can get your AR here brother your AR will be useless because it's the word of God but it is no longer the will of God are we together so there are times when the word of God may not be the will of God it Remains the word of God but it is no longer the will of God this is why in every age God sends a messenger to declare his will out of his word so that when you follow that will you automatically fulfilling from Genesis to Revelation he says don't question it believe it don't find a way around it brother Bram says if you look for a way around it Hallelujah he says you might you might look for a way around it that is permissive will Hallelujah but it is not perfect God may allow it but he will not accept it that is why the the word says the way we were born for example our natural birth God allowed us to come the way we come out but he never accepted it that is why when he came down himself he commanded you must be born again walking in permissive will is very dangerous Hallelujah and brother Bram says you can even find God blessing you in it but the end of it is you're going to lose are we together I'm going to skip a few things so we can quickly finish this amen choice is a great thing what you choose by yourself you can choose wrong so let God make a choice on your behalf are we together that is why we thank God that beyond the K of time the Saints who went were in their theop bodies in the body that you know all things in the body that you never be deceived the Saints cored in one voice and when they saw the prophet Hallelujah when the prophet went to the other side and they said where the Prophet says uh I want to see Jesus and they said we are waiting for you to introduce us to him and he says will Paul do the same said certainly will Peter do the same certainly he says I preached what Paul preached Hallelujah I preached what Peter preached so if Paul's group make it mine will make it Hallelujah because I preached what Paul preached and the Saints who they cored in one voice and then they said on this we are resting brother we are resting upon these ctes we are resting upon this word of Malachi 4 hallelujah oh we thank God for his word so we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it don't assume it take it the way it said Hallelujah why are why should you be scared by the will of God in your life you don't have any reason to be scared butam says we do not choose by what we see but we choose but what by what we believe because what we see is just quantity of our of what our eyes can declare if I stand here I can probably look at somebody who is one mile away from me but when he's one mile away I can just see that it's a human being but I can't really tell who that is right but God when he sees that he knows the beginning and the ending so let God choose because he knows what's ahead of you are we together so you have to surrender your choice to God God made three physical choices in your life that you had no contribution in number one he made a choice of you a choice for you and a choice about you are we together you had no contribution in those choices and if your mind runs very well you're going to see that some of the choices you love them we're going to share them in in 5 minutes are we together so let's begin with spiritual choices how many are happy to be Christians this evening did you choose to be a Christian God chose to chose on your behalf for you to be a Christian let's give God a clap offering Hallelujah even if you sing a song I would rather be an oldtime Christian than anything I know that's very good you are just realizing the choice that God chose of you but you never made that choice Hallelujah that's why you see that that choice was beyond you that's why says Jesus Christ said he never you never chose God but Jesus Christ chose you so you can begin to trust him Hallelujah are we together so he chose that for you so let's look at some of the choices he made for you of you and about you in the message choosing of a bride paragraph 2:15 he says remember what I said other the other day when we were having breakfast he says in the pollen of breeding male and female there's millions of gems going forth millions of eggs going forth but there's only one of them that lived he says there's everyone just like that he says out of a million gems everyone of them the same egg the same kind of gam one of them lives the rest of them died what am I saying in the hour of conception many of the lives died are we together but one of one of these million of of of lives it is the only one there's only one that did match the other life for it to become you are we together so without competition without fighting out of a million of gems just one became you are we together there must be a supernatural intelligence that took place out of 999,000 999 were wasted only one was to become you amen are we together and they said go go go go go go they left and you became that conception andam says not even mama or Papa or anybody could decide among those lives from the conception I want to ask that question to say who made that decision talk to me who made that decision so let's give God a pass mark Hallelujah who made that choice that was God he made that choice for you or maybe we ask one brother here to say okay maybe you remember years maybe millions of years of light space brother did God ever ask you of whom of who you want to be my brother who made that choice for you that's God right so God is the one who made certain choices for us hallelujah let me just keep a lot of things here I see my time is up let's stand brother Bram made a choice in the message Paradox he says because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has made thou has walked in your own choosing walk in that choice and find the will of God for you am he says thou has picked the correct and precise decision he says it is my way that was God's choice for brother Branham and and brother Bram says because of this momentous decision why was it momentous because when brother Bram accepted that choice heaven was startled heaven was happy and he says a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee he says what a glorious decision thou has made one time Moses made a choice he was born from uh the house of he was in the house of pharaoh he's seeing all the opulence he's seeing all the the the resources and everything the mother went to Moses and says you are a slave he says you mean I'm a slave he says yes you are just in this Palace and Moses noticed that you know what I one day I have to make a choice he chose the reproach and left all the riches of Egypt and chose to suffer and be a delivery and he chose to be in a situation which was not convenient but 800 years later that choice paid off we saw him at Mount Transfiguration Walking With Jesus Christ may God bless [Applause] you amen aren't you glad Jesus made that choice to go to Calvary for you that all the chastisements of all your sins he laid upon Him amen are we together amen amen I'm together with God's word aren't you let's open our Bibles and uh turn to our scripture in Corinthians brother Bill you're going to have to come read our communion scripture for me this evening if the brothers would go prepare the communion tonight we'll have communion service go ahead and read this scripture for I 1 Corinthian uh 11 verse uh the 23rd verse he says for I have received of the Lord that which I have also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had St saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till I come wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and the blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another it said and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen amen bless you Brothers we certainly have a choice tonight to choose communion to judge ourselves whether we're worthy let us by our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have the bread here Lord that we ask you to bless as we're remembering the body of Christ Lord that was shed for us on Calvary father the life that was given we ask you to bless it father for it is meat inde deed it is the word of God of life to us our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have the cup of wine here this evening that represents your blood father the stimulation of Revelation to the believer that he could be stimulated in the word of God could be revealed to him that he could have life father we've come to partake this communion as a symbol of our partaking of the will of God our partaking of the word of God our being obedient to the Commandments of God and to show forth that we believe the word that you so Gallant Vindicated to us in this generation that that's the path that we choose to follow that's the life that we choose to identify with father and we take communion to make an outward expression of our heart's desire to live and to follow your word without compromise father Lord It's a symbol to all that look on that we have identified ourselves with Calvary we have identified ourselves with the baptism of the Holy Spirit we have identified ourselves with the unadulterated word of Truth truth and light and father that's in which we commune we commune with you we ask you to bless the Believers this evening those that will come and partake and display their faith father may you bless them Father may they examine themselves and purpose in their heart to make those things that aren't right in their lives right and father so let them eat and so let them be blessed we ask you tonight amen
