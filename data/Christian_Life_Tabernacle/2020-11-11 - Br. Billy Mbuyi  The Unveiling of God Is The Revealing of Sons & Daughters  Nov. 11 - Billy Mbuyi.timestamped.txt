[36:38] something will be said tonight that will
[36:39] be of help to all of us amen uh let's
[36:44] turn our Bibles let's open to uh Romans
[36:47] chapter uh
[36:49] 8 a very familiar scripture reading
[36:51] we're going to start from verse 14
[37:02] Romans 8
[37:04] and4 it says for as many as are led by
[37:08] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[37:11] God for ye have not received the spirit
[37:14] of bondage again for fear but ye have
[37:17] received the spirit of the adoption
[37:19] where where we cry whereby we cry ABA
[37:22] father it said the spirit itself beareth
[37:25] witness with our spirit that we are the
[37:28] children of God and if children then HS
[37:33] of God and join air with Jesus if so be
[37:37] that this that we suffer with him and we
[37:41] shall that we may be also glorified
[37:45] together it says for I reckon that the
[37:48] suffering of this present time are not
[37:52] worthy to be compared with the glory
[37:55] which shall be revealed in US
[37:58] for the earnest expectation of of of the
[38:02] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[38:05] of the sons of God for the creature was
[38:08] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[38:13] the reason of him who had subjected the
[38:16] same in hope now I want you to realize
[38:19] what it said the creature was made
[38:21] subject to vanity not by his own will
[38:24] but that's how it was made it says
[38:26] because the the the create the creature
[38:29] itself also shall be delivered from the
[38:32] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[38:34] Liberty of the children of God and I
[38:38] so like this I I'll just Paul is
[38:42] continually just reminding us the
[38:44] children of God the children of God the
[38:47] children of God it said for we know that
[38:50] the whole creation granth and travaileth
[38:54] in pain together until now not only only
[38:57] they but ourselves also which have the
[39:00] first fruit of the spirit even we also
[39:04] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[39:08] adoption to with the Redemption of our
[39:10] body he said for we are saved by hope
[39:14] but hope that is not seen is not hope
[39:18] for what a man seeth why did where why
[39:22] do does he hope for for if we hope for
[39:27] what we see we see not then we do with
[39:31] patience wait for it likewise the spirit
[39:34] also helped our
[39:35] infirmities for we
[39:39] know for we know not what we should pray
[39:43] for as we ought as we ought but the
[39:46] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[39:49] with groaning which cannot be
[39:52] uttered and he that searcheth the heart
[39:56] knoweth what is in the mind of the
[39:59] spirit because he maketh intercession
[40:02] for the Saints according to the will of
[40:05] God and then he says and we know that
[40:08] all things work together for good for
[40:10] them that love God to them who are
[40:13] called according to his purpose for whom
[40:17] he did for new he also did he
[40:21] predestinate to be conformed to the
[40:23] image of his son and that he might be
[40:26] the first Mo be be the firstborn among
[40:28] many Brethren it says moreover whom did
[40:31] he he did predestinate them he also call
[40:36] whom he called them he also Justified
[40:39] whom he justified them he also glorify
[40:43] what shall we say of these things if God
[40:46] be for us who could be against us let's
[40:49] also turn to one more scripture reading
[40:51] in
[40:52] Philippians uh chapter 2
[40:58] chapter 2 he says if there be if there
[41:03] if there be therefore any consolation in
[41:06] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[41:10] Fellowship of the spirit any bows of
[41:12] Mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[41:16] likeminded having the same
[41:19] love uh being of one Accord and one mind
[41:23] let not let not let nothing be done
[41:26] through strive of in glory but in
[41:29] loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other
[41:33] better than themselves look not every
[41:35] man on his own thing on his own things
[41:38] but every man on the things of others
[41:41] let this mind be in you which was also
[41:44] in Christ Jesus whom being in a form of
[41:47] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[41:50] with God but made himself of no
[41:53] reputation and took upon him the form of
[41:56] a servant and was made in likeness of
[42:00] man and being found in fashion as a man
[42:03] he humbled himself and became obedient
[42:06] unto death even the death of the Cross
[42:09] wherefore God also had highly exalted
[42:12] him and given him a name that is above
[42:15] every name that at the name of Jesus
[42:18] every knee shall bow every that the name
[42:20] of Jesus every knee should bow all
[42:24] things in heaven and things on earth and
[42:27] things under the Earth and that every
[42:30] Tong should confess that Jesus Christ is
[42:33] Lord to the glory of God the Father
[42:36] father we ask you bless your word to us
[42:38] we commit ourselves to your hands in the
[42:40] name of Jesus Christ we pray
[42:42] amen God bless you may have your
[42:48] seats amen we'll try not to be too long
[42:51] tonight but
[42:57] am man just have a a little thought in
[43:01] on our mind
[43:03] and we'll give you the title as we move
[43:06] along um I was just thinking about some
[43:10] of the things that our pastor has been
[43:13] talking about um even about the time
[43:16] that we're living in and what uh a time
[43:20] where a faithless generation like the
[43:23] scriptures calls it a faithless
[43:25] generation where man is rejected faith
[43:28] and embraced uh science and and you
[43:31] begin to look uh we can uh look at the
[43:34] Bible and we know but bham says often
[43:37] and and and so many times it would say
[43:40] that you know if I was asked in what age
[43:43] I would live in this is the age and this
[43:45] is the age and yet we sit here we look
[43:48] at the wickedness that's around us we
[43:50] look at just the confusion and all those
[43:52] things and and and what we need to come
[43:55] to the realization is uh uh to an
[43:57] unbeliever this is scary this is the
[44:00] scariest condition that you can ever be
[44:02] that's why people are Marching and and
[44:05] fighting and all kinds of things because
[44:07] this that's all they have but to the
[44:09] believer it's a glorious time because
[44:12] it's a glorious time because this is the
[44:15] Fulfillment of scripture this is the
[44:17] Fulfillment of Prophecy we can look at
[44:19] the world's condition and come together
[44:21] tonight and say that we can look outside
[44:24] and say that today this scripture is
[44:26] fulfilled and everything that's playing
[44:29] out there everything that we look out
[44:31] there that's happening it's happening
[44:33] exactly according to the prophecy that
[44:35] was given at the end time if you think
[44:38] about people and and and and the nature
[44:41] and and the way people are acting and I
[44:43] was talking about David uh the other day
[44:45] I said I was so amazed even as you was
[44:47] reading those things I was following uh
[44:51] one of the speeches that the the
[44:53] president-elect gave and everything and
[44:55] one of the the point that he wanted to
[44:57] make was that we and I'm just
[45:00] paraphrasing it it says that we will
[45:01] follow science whatever science tells us
[45:04] to do that's what we're going to do
[45:06] whatever this experts this educated
[45:09] people whatever they come up with
[45:11] whatever they tell us to do that's what
[45:12] we're going to do in other words science
[45:14] has become their God and I thought about
[45:17] there's another group of people who have
[45:20] not taken science and and God is their
[45:23] God faith is what they've been given for
[45:26] them to walk by it's not because we
[45:29] realize that this world was not framed
[45:31] by science science can take it and tell
[45:33] you that this is this many years old
[45:35] this is this you could put this together
[45:37] and do that but we understand the
[45:39] scripture tell us it was by the word of
[45:41] God that this was put together so we can
[45:44] come to a place and we begin to realize
[45:46] you know the the the the world out there
[45:48] is is making history united state has
[45:51] made history this is the first elected
[45:54] woman of color and a woman in the
[45:57] position of Vice President you can look
[45:59] at that people are rejoicing over those
[46:01] things and
[46:02] realize that how that this uh with
[46:05] they're making advancements they can
[46:07] claim they're making great achievement
[46:09] but we realize as our even as our Pastor
[46:11] said as the world is making his
[46:13] achievement we need to pay attention to
[46:16] the achievement that God is making these
[46:19] things are not just happening over the
[46:21] blue and we just look and say we are a
[46:24] people that have been warned that have
[46:26] been given given a word for us to look
[46:28] at what's happening out there and be
[46:30] able to look at the word of God and say
[46:32] that this today is the scripture being
[46:35] fulfilled and as this is happening I
[46:37] need to look at what is my portion in
[46:39] the word what is my portion in the
[46:42] scripture because as that is being
[46:44] fulfilled God is also fulfilling
[46:46] something God is not sitting on the
[46:49] sideline God is fulfilling his word and
[46:52] and we we know we don't have a portion
[46:54] with what's happening out there but
[46:56] there a portion for us in the scripture
[46:58] for us to also fulfill so we could see
[47:02] uh how that they they put the hearts and
[47:05] they put everything that they have in in
[47:07] science and they're hoping that they can
[47:09] come up with a way for them uh uh to
[47:12] make life better they always try to
[47:14] improve uh they a home that was built 10
[47:17] years ago the home that's built today
[47:19] they make Improvement by science they do
[47:22] it better they achieve it they go
[47:23] forward and they do all those things and
[47:26] the prophet tells us perhaps I'll don't
[47:28] know if I'll get time to get to
