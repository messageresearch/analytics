[39:14] [Music]
[39:18] is
[39:21] [Music]
[39:28] before we start this evening we want to
[39:30] give a little update on
[39:32] kayla bill
[39:34] and uh
[39:37] anyway
[39:39] caleb didn't know that he had to
[39:43] watch his sugar
[39:44] and his sugar got out of balance and it
[39:47] got really high
[39:50] and when that happens to you it puts you
[39:53] to sleep
[39:54] so he wasn't in a coma like an accident
[39:57] coma
[39:59] or a
[40:00] brain damaged coma
[40:02] but he was in what they refer to as a
[40:05] diabetic coma so
[40:08] he'll be fine he just needs to
[40:11] uh realize that he
[40:14] can't eat all the cakes and cookies and
[40:16] drink all the cokes and eat all the
[40:18] pizzas
[40:19] that he used to
[40:21] but he'll be fine in their they're
[40:24] getting him back uh
[40:26] to normal his system got out of balance
[40:28] they're giving him electrolytes
[40:30] and there gave him some insulin to bring
[40:33] his blood sugar down and he'll be fine
[40:35] in just a couple days so
[40:38] we're grateful for that
[40:42] so
[40:43] we understand that
[40:44] this evening you know many times we talk
[40:49] about him about the lord
[40:52] what he can do
[40:54] and what he promised to do
[40:58] but a lot of times we don't
[41:01] go on and follow up
[41:03] about what he has done and the promises
[41:06] he has kept
[41:08] and so this evening
[41:11] brother darion
[41:13] is going to
[41:15] share with us tonight
[41:17] all that the lord promised
[41:19] all what god's done in his life and
[41:22] and he has a tremendous
[41:24] testimony of his journey he's here
[41:27] tonight by the grace of god
[41:31] he was on his deathbed
[41:34] but
[41:36] god
[41:37] intervened
[41:39] so
[41:40] i'm not going to take a lot of time i'm
[41:42] going to go out there and sit with you
[41:44] or i can
[41:46] look at him and take notes of his
[41:49] nervousness and
[41:50] any mistakes he makes
[41:52] so
[41:55] we can
[41:57] tease them later
[42:00] darian has such a lovely spirit that
[42:03] that we all we get we tease him all the
[42:07] time
[42:08] you know his his spirit is so nice and
[42:11] so warm and friendly that
[42:14] he went out in the parking lot one
[42:17] service and
[42:18] interviewed and
[42:20] talked to a guy and
[42:21] invited him into church and the guy was
[42:24] out there stealing purses
[42:26] out of the cars but
[42:28] so that's just kind of the attitude that
[42:30] he has and and we love him
[42:33] he
[42:34] to me he's a gift from god
[42:36] to help
[42:38] me personally
[42:39] and our body he's got wonderful support
[42:42] so
[42:43] i'd like to introduce him at this time

[42:51] right here

[42:55] doesn't get
[42:57] because jackson's got to sit everybody
[42:59] down and move people darren just

[52:30] peter was jumped up can i say something
[52:32] can i say something wait wait can i say
[52:34] something well tonight i want to say
[52:36] something
[52:38] for the lord amen you know appreciate
[52:40] everyone that's here
[52:42] those that are live streaming
[52:44] it is good to be in the house of the
[52:46] lord he promised me two or three are
[52:48] gathered

[52:54] we've heard our pastor so many times
[52:56] god cannot lie he's he's he's not a man
[52:59] that he should lie
[53:00] and we're grateful that we can stand
[53:02] here and just worship him and glorify
[53:04] him in this
[53:06] moment
[53:07] you know
[53:08] it's uh amazing how
[53:10] i just enjoy listening to some of the
[53:12] ministers and that we have in our local
[53:14] fellowship
[53:15] and and the little things that they have
[53:17] that just it excites me when i hear them
[53:19] preach because brother david told me one
[53:21] time when you get so excited just rather
[53:24] raise your hand than jumping up and
[53:26] so i'll just raise my hand when you see
[53:28] me raise my hand i'm excited so praise
[53:30] the lord anyhow hallelujah amen
[53:33] so um anyway um
[53:36] i was about
[53:37] oh
[53:39] nine years old when i just
[53:42] my dad and a good friend of my dad
[53:46] at the age of 16
[53:48] they were doing missions work
[53:51] with a
[53:52] another
[53:54] minister back then this guy dressed
[53:56] exactly like brother branham
[53:58] i told a few brothers this
[54:00] and uh white jacket pants and the
[54:04] sucker trousers and the hat the white
[54:06] hat
[54:07] and
[54:07] he had a gift that
[54:10] was undeniably god working in human
[54:12] flesh it was about the same time as
[54:14] brother bran was on the on the scene um
[54:16] his name was cecil gilbert
[54:20] but my dad always came home with these
[54:22] stories about how god would work
[54:25] the miraculous in these tent meetings
[54:27] that they would have up north in
[54:29] northern south africa
[54:31] and
[54:32] you know where um
[54:35] the blind would see the deaf would hear
[54:38] and
[54:39] the the squinted eyes would come
[54:41] straight and
[54:42] he said even knees would pop and legs
[54:44] would grow limbs would grow and hands
[54:45] would grow feet would grow and you're
[54:47] sitting there as a nine year old i'm
[54:49] thinking man
[54:51] i wish i can talk to that guy that's
[54:53] able to do that
[54:55] you know
[54:56] why i don't know at the time
[54:59] and
[55:00] i always i was fascinated me and my
[55:01] brother we were just fascinated by it
[55:04] and
[55:05] as we grew up you know we started seeing
[55:08] how god worked and and different things
[55:10] in our lives so
[55:12] this is just the for uh part of the the
[55:14] house that we're building tonight just
[55:16] to get to the end of where i'm going
[55:19] and um at the age of 14
[55:22] i had my personal experience with the
[55:24] lord jesus christ
[55:26] where he
[55:27] brought me i remember it was a small
[55:29] little group of
[55:31] the the fellowship with brother beckett
[55:33] was just maybe 50 people at the time the
[55:35] church was still growing
[55:37] and
[55:38] i was called well the lord brought me up
[55:40] i don't know how i got to the to the
[55:41] front or to the pulpit and we prayed and
[55:44] and um from that day on
[55:47] i was a changed person
[55:50] from the inside out now the flesh man
[55:53] was still fighting because the flesh man
[55:56] was still an athlete the flesh man was
[55:58] still very smart
[56:00] the flesh man was still handsome had
[56:02] hair
[56:03] [Laughter]
[56:05] so the flesh man was definitely at war
[56:09] with a spirit man
[56:11] but
[56:12] god knew how to beat that out of me
[56:15] over time and in his best way and the
[56:17] way that he wanted me to grow
[56:20] and i remember
[56:22] being at school after my
[56:25] experience with the lord and this is i'm
[56:27] going to high school now
[56:28] and uh talking to friends and just
[56:30] sharing the gospel with them and how can
[56:32] you not see that jesus christ is the
[56:34] same yesterday today and forever that
[56:36] there's only one baptism in jesus
[56:38] christ's name that you cannot baptize in
[56:40] the name of the father and son of god
[56:42] and the holy ghost i sat with my uncle
[56:44] it was a pentecost and i showed him i
[56:46] had a bottle of coke and i poured it
[56:48] into three glasses i said the same coke
[56:50] this is how jesus oh he got so upset how
[56:52] can you make our god a bottle of coke
[56:56] but the carnal man was trying to express
[56:58] something that he could i loved him so
[56:59] much i wanted him to see it but yet
[57:02] he didn't see it you know and he passed
[57:04] away
[57:05] um knowing the lord jesus christ but was
[57:07] never baptized in the name of the lord
[57:09] jesus christ but that's okay i know i'll
[57:11] see him on the other side
[57:13] by god's grace and i'm sure there's many
[57:15] of you that have gone that same path or
[57:17] seen the same things but anyway as i
[57:19] grew up
[57:20] the lord took things away from me and
[57:22] slowly but surely as i matured in the
[57:24] wood and as i studied the word and laid
[57:26] in the presence of the sun
[57:28] more of the word opened up to me the
[57:30] seals were opened up and
[57:32] i just started looking at things from a
[57:34] different perspective
[57:36] you know
[57:37] my original plan
[57:39] back then
[57:40] was to be a cardiologist and i had the
[57:43] grades and
[57:44] made it in the in the top 10 percent of
[57:47] my graduating class from high school
[57:49] everything was fine
[57:51] and i walked away from a career in
[57:54] soccer
[57:56] and scholarships and all that and then i
[57:58] came here to the united states my dad
[57:59] they might come here
[58:01] we immigrated
[58:03] well
[58:04] it was a vacation at the time during
[58:07] south africa it was still on the
[58:08] apartheid so we couldn't we weren't
[58:10] allowed to leave the country as
[58:12] immigrants we could go on vacation
[58:15] so we came on a vacation
[58:18] and um we
[58:20] stayed that was back in connecticut
[58:24] you know
[58:25] and uh
[58:26] yeah
[58:27] well
[58:29] enjoy that one because that was the best
[58:31] part of it that the other stuff is still
[58:33] coming
[58:34] and um
[58:36] as the years went on we started a few
[58:38] businesses out there and and things went
[58:40] well
[58:41] and um
[58:43] i wasn't sick everything was fine i was
[58:45] strong i was work i was doing roofing um
[58:48] i was doing we had a limousine company
[58:50] we had a horticultural business so i was
[58:53] busy i was able to do all the manual
[58:56] labor so with the church building coming
[58:58] up that we're going to start real soon
[59:00] we trust the lord
[59:01] i will be putting my shoulder to the
[59:03] wheel i'm sure many of you will as well
[59:04] because there's a vision
[59:06] and that vision will become reality real
[59:08] soon we believe that
[59:10] and
[59:12] so
[59:13] with all that
[59:15] we were i was in the mindset of well
[59:18] we're making all this money the church
[59:21] is growing because the church was
[59:22] growing we went to about
[59:24] 70 80 80 people um it started to grow
[59:28] in connecticut
[59:30] and
[59:31] my dad was the pastor there
[59:33] and we would do outreach and things like
[59:35] that and people would just start coming
[59:37] in
[59:38] but the reason why the people came in
[59:40] was not so much because of the word it
[59:42] was more because of they were attracted
[59:43] to
[59:45] these two young boys
[59:48] under the age of 30
[59:49] being so successful in businesses
[59:51] different businesses and just
[59:54] doing well
[59:56] so that was the attraction that brought
[59:58] them in
[59:59] um there's still a church there i
[1:00:01] believe brother
[1:00:03] what's the brother's name now
[1:00:05] i forget his name
[1:00:07] my brother lamb
[1:00:09] greg
[1:00:10] i forget brother jackson told me what
[1:00:11] his name was but anyway i think yes
[1:00:14] brother brewer i believe he might be up
[1:00:16] there at that little fellowship there
[1:00:18] now
[1:00:19] but um
[1:00:22] that was started but then the lord in 96
[1:00:26] took all of that away from us
[1:00:29] you go from a
[1:00:31] a company and a business that was
[1:00:33] a very very well-off
[1:00:37] we would walk into ford and just point
[1:00:39] to the vehicles that we wanted and walk
[1:00:41] out they would deliver it nothing signed
[1:00:43] everything was done
[1:00:45] that's how strong of a business
[1:00:49] report we had
[1:00:51] but that was not god's plan for the
[1:00:53] fellowship
[1:00:54] and when he took that away it brought us
[1:00:56] back down to
[1:00:57] who we truly were
[1:00:59] sons and daughters born again called for
[1:01:02] a higher calling a purpose not for the
[1:01:05] flesh and the entertainment of this
[1:01:07] flesh
[1:01:08] but for the souls of sons and daughters
[1:01:10] of god
[1:01:12] and then we moved to ohio
[1:01:16] and during that time you all know about
[1:01:17] my wonderful wife my queen and yeah i
[1:01:20] won't go into that sister kelly might
[1:01:22] enjoy that too much
[1:01:25] but
[1:01:26] you know
[1:01:27] so we moved to ohio and
[1:01:30] the boys are born joshua and daniel
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:34] at the time i did not have my green card
[1:01:37] i didn't have any legal paperwork i just
[1:01:39] had employment authorization
[1:01:41] so i didn't have a stitch of paperwork
[1:01:44] to say that i should stay here
[1:01:47] and
[1:01:48] my attorney then his name was brian
[1:01:50] defranco i'm very good friends with him
[1:01:51] now
[1:01:52] he advised us in
[1:01:55] 2005
[1:01:57] that we should go back to south africa
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:00] if you've never been in a situation like
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:03] let me just explain to you with
[1:02:05] ice and the ins and
[1:02:08] it's it's very real it's uh it's
[1:02:10] constantly on your mind
[1:02:12] as a provider as a
[1:02:15] husband as a dad
[1:02:17] and you have to do things that
[1:02:19] you're sometimes not very proud of but
[1:02:20] that you have to provide for your family
[1:02:23] and that
[1:02:25] gets you through body god never
[1:02:28] failed to provide in our needs during
[1:02:31] all of that time amen he was the same
[1:02:34] steli is the same yesterday today and
[1:02:36] forever
[1:02:37] and um
[1:02:40] we we went back to south africa but
[1:02:42] before we went back alana's mom sister
[1:02:45] lavona she passed away from kansa
[1:02:48] lana got there a few days too late
[1:02:52] but by god's grace she was able to go
[1:02:54] and then later that year i went this is
[1:02:56] in 2005
[1:02:58] so now that you know
[1:03:00] that part of a little bit of my life now
[1:03:02] comes the other part
[1:03:05] so in south africa
[1:03:07] we went to the embassy there
[1:03:09] and
[1:03:11] tried to come back to the united states
[1:03:13] we didn't have our girls our beautiful
[1:03:15] wonderful little girls
[1:03:16] didn't have them yet
[1:03:18] we just had the boys and um
[1:03:21] so we went to the ambassador there and
[1:03:23] uh we started the morning real early we
[1:03:25] got there around seven when they just
[1:03:27] opened
[1:03:28] we sat there the whole day
[1:03:30] until they closed we were there first
[1:03:34] we sat there it was just me and my wife
[1:03:35] and the ambassador came out and she said
[1:03:38] there is no way that i will allow you to
[1:03:41] go back to the united states ever in
[1:03:43] your life
[1:03:45] my wife looked at me if you if you if
[1:03:47] your wife has ever looked at you with
[1:03:48] that look of loss
[1:03:52] then you know what i'm talking about she
[1:03:54] looked at me and she said what are we
[1:03:56] going to do
[1:03:57] well i'm the man i should have the
[1:03:59] answer
[1:04:00] i i don't know
[1:04:03] i have to trust the lord
[1:04:04] and
[1:04:05] you know we'll see what happens from
[1:04:07] there because the man part was still
[1:04:10] fighting the man said we can go to
[1:04:12] canada we know some believers up there
[1:04:14] we know brother briscoe uh my dad at
[1:04:16] least knows brother biscuit and some
[1:04:17] believers up there and um or we could go
[1:04:19] to mexico and then go from there
[1:04:23] but that
[1:04:24] definitely was not the plan that god had
[1:04:26] in store for us
[1:04:28] so let me get you into this part of my
[1:04:30] life
[1:04:32] in 2006
[1:04:34] in cape town south africa while we were
[1:04:36] on a mini getaway with some of our
[1:04:37] friends of ours
[1:04:40] i started feeling cold and shivering
[1:04:42] like someone in a very
[1:04:44] severe anaphylactic shock if you don't
[1:04:46] know what it is you're just shaking
[1:04:48] like it's nobody's business and you are
[1:04:51] super cold
[1:04:52] i had about five or six pairs of socks
[1:04:55] on extra pairs of layers of pants and
[1:04:59] jackets and blankets and a fire going i
[1:05:02] could not get rid of this shiver and the
[1:05:05] cold
[1:05:07] and my wife looked at me and she noticed
[1:05:08] that my eyes and my skin looked very
[1:05:10] yellow
[1:05:13] well i thought wow it's just something i
[1:05:14] ate you know because we were on the
[1:05:16] coastline
[1:05:17] we went fishing a few days before that i
[1:05:20] ate some um
[1:05:22] mussels and scallops right off the rock
[1:05:24] so i could just pick it up and peel it
[1:05:25] out and eat it just like that
[1:05:27] so i love the ocean i really really love
[1:05:30] it i i just there's just something about
[1:05:32] it that calms me when i sit there and
[1:05:33] just listen to the waves going back and
[1:05:35] forth
[1:05:36] and
[1:05:38] yeah but that was my south diagnosis
[1:05:42] then we went i went to the doctor that
[1:05:44] monday
[1:05:47] and that's when the doctor gave me a
[1:05:50] diagnosis after
[1:05:52] a long day of blood work
[1:05:54] and they basically told me that i had
[1:05:57] five months left to live
[1:06:00] so now you're sitting there you can't go
[1:06:03] back to the u.s
[1:06:04] your wife is concerned because
[1:06:07] you're not healthy
[1:06:08] you have your two boys you have to take
[1:06:10] care of
[1:06:12] and it's just it seems like an
[1:06:15] impossible
[1:06:16] task
[1:06:18] so that reminds me of the scripture
[1:06:20] where
[1:06:23] daniel went into the lion's den
[1:06:26] he didn't stand at the corner of the
[1:06:28] lion's den or the front of the side of
[1:06:30] the
[1:06:31] he was in it
[1:06:33] and god
[1:06:34] only then came on the scene
[1:06:38] the boys in the fiery furnace the same
[1:06:40] deal
[1:06:41] the fire consumed those that even stood
[1:06:43] close to the fire didn't touch them god
[1:06:46] was already on the scene
[1:06:48] i didn't know that god was already on
[1:06:50] the scene i thought well i'm probably
[1:06:51] going to make not make it
[1:06:53] told my dad i called my cousin he said
[1:06:55] you're a doctor
[1:06:56] said hey this is my diagnosis he was
[1:06:58] like what brother david met him his name
[1:07:00] is alan
[1:07:03] and
[1:07:04] he said we got to get you stateside man
[1:07:07] we got to hit you i said how how
[1:07:10] well we prayed my father-in-law brother
[1:07:13] earl prayed and my dad then prayed on
[1:07:14] this side in the congregation
[1:07:17] and um
[1:07:20] my liver at the time was swollen about
[1:07:23] four times
[1:07:24] the normal size of a liver so if you see
[1:07:26] a liver it's about about a big
[1:07:29] sits on the side you have your the right
[1:07:31] side it just
[1:07:32] it's basically the
[1:07:34] the junkyard processor
[1:07:36] cleans everything out that you eaten and
[1:07:39] stuff
[1:07:40] and um four times outside so that thing
[1:07:43] was standing out like that
[1:07:45] there's basically nothing that they
[1:07:46] could do but put me on a very strict
[1:07:50] um severe diet now you brother brown
[1:07:52] talks about the a shadow of a chicken
[1:07:56] starved to death
[1:07:58] i cannot i can testify to that i was on
[1:08:01] a diet like that it was broth
[1:08:05] beef broth chicken broth
[1:08:08] toast no butter
[1:08:11] tuna
[1:08:12] no sauces no salt no pepper
[1:08:15] um
[1:08:18] that was my diet boiled eggs now and
[1:08:20] then not too much because it gives too
[1:08:22] much gas
[1:08:25] and
[1:08:26] yeah it was
[1:08:28] i think it was for three or four months
[1:08:30] was it longer than that lana six months
[1:08:33] i don't even remember i just knew i
[1:08:35] wanted to get out of that
[1:08:38] because hey i love to eat and i love to
[1:08:40] eat good food
[1:08:41] and that thing was oh that was rough
[1:08:44] that was really really rough
[1:08:47] and
[1:08:48] you know and
[1:08:50] it was just by god's grace that
[1:08:52] i couldn't walk from
[1:08:55] i would sit on in my father-in-law's old
[1:08:57] house he sold that house now
[1:09:00] you sat in the sofa year when you came
[1:09:01] through the front door you sat in the
[1:09:03] sofa and there was
[1:09:04] the kitchen was just a few feet away i
[1:09:06] couldn't stand up and walk by myself
[1:09:09] from that sofa
[1:09:11] to that door that piano from this pooper
[1:09:14] to that i could not walk by myself my
[1:09:16] precious wife there had to carry me and
[1:09:20] for brothers that's looking for a real
[1:09:21] genuine born again wife
[1:09:25] trust in the lord pray pray pray he'll
[1:09:28] give you the desire of your heart
[1:09:30] because he definitely gave me my desire
[1:09:32] of my heart because my wife was
[1:09:36] beyond special
[1:09:38] pick me up
[1:09:39] put me into bed
[1:09:41] pray with me she'd wash my feet
[1:09:44] you know just take care of me like a
[1:09:46] real
[1:09:48] wonderful born-again christian but also
[1:09:50] a wife a mom
[1:09:54] and
[1:09:55] yeah that was that was a very very rough
[1:09:57] time
[1:09:58] you know you
[1:10:00] you think about life and
[1:10:02] things come into real perspective real
[1:10:04] fast
[1:10:06] it's not so much about
[1:10:08] the businesses that you own
[1:10:11] the cause that you had the money that
[1:10:12] you had
[1:10:14] it's more about just can i take my next
[1:10:16] breath
[1:10:18] can i live to see another day
[1:10:20] will i be able to sleep tonight
[1:10:23] will i be able to move in the morning
[1:10:25] when i wake up then it becomes real
[1:10:28] and then the fact of the matter is
[1:10:30] where is god in all of this
[1:10:33] because you're now in the
[1:10:34] you're having your juniper tree
[1:10:35] experience
[1:10:37] as is your moment where the enemy is
[1:10:38] just pounding you day and night
[1:10:42] you don't see results of getting better
[1:10:44] you don't feel the results of getting
[1:10:45] better
[1:10:46] but yet you know he promised
[1:10:49] he promised that he'll never leave you
[1:10:51] nor forsake you he promised that he's
[1:10:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:55] and that for me is always been what
[1:10:58] carried me through when i look back
[1:11:01] to that age when i was 14 years old when
[1:11:04] that reality struck me when jesus christ
[1:11:06] came my way
[1:11:08] it changed my projection my life
[1:11:12] it was just
[1:11:13] it was just amazing it still is to this
[1:11:16] day that is what's carrying me every
[1:11:18] single day of my life
[1:11:20] so anyway
[1:11:22] long story short
[1:11:25] the ambassador that told us that we
[1:11:27] would never ever be able to come back to
[1:11:29] the united states again wrote a letter
[1:11:32] with her hand
[1:11:33] and signed it with her hand
[1:11:36] supporting my wife and myself to come
[1:11:38] back to the united states in 2007
[1:11:42] so now you can start seeing the hand of
[1:11:44] god working
[1:11:45] and
[1:11:46] now you're not sure well i'm going back
[1:11:48] to the united states what for lord
[1:11:50] i'm a dying man
[1:11:53] what am i coming back to this united
[1:11:54] states for
[1:11:57] so in
[1:11:59] 2007 went back and then
[1:12:04] we moved from connecticut to ohio in
[1:12:08] 2009
[1:12:10] so when i had my first
[1:12:13] medical emergency knowledge
[1:12:15] god said he'll heal you
[1:12:18] and it's never in your time
[1:12:20] it's never in the way you expect it
[1:12:23] never in the way you want it
[1:12:25] but it's in his way he's time
[1:12:28] and the way he wants to do it to show
[1:12:30] his glory
[1:12:33] you know and um
[1:12:36] 2009 is when they gave me my actual
[1:12:38] diagnosis of primary sclerosing
[1:12:42] cholangitis and ulcerative colitis i
[1:12:44] know there's many nurses in here so they
[1:12:46] know what this is about and
[1:12:49] stage four cirrhosis of the liver
[1:12:52] so i was in pretty bad shape even though
[1:12:54] my outward appearance didn't look like
[1:12:56] it
[1:12:57] i thought my wife was going to give me
[1:12:58] that picture of
[1:13:01] myself when i was a
[1:13:02] back in 06 when i was so skinny
[1:13:06] then some of the brothers would have
[1:13:08] understood but i said i was skinny
[1:13:12] hard to believe i i agree if you want to
[1:13:14] laugh that's okay go ahead and chuckle
[1:13:16] because this fat boy was skinny at one
[1:13:18] point
[1:13:21] anyway so
[1:13:23] um there's autoimmune disease where your
[1:13:25] body just attacks
[1:13:28] its own but well my autoimmune system
[1:13:31] attacks my body
[1:13:33] instead of fighting off the virus it
[1:13:35] just attacked my liver
[1:13:37] the doctors tried to find out why
[1:13:41] they did a lot of research at ohio state
[1:13:43] university and
[1:13:45] different places to figure out what it
[1:13:47] was some said it could have been
[1:13:48] something i ate that was contaminated
[1:13:51] some thought it was something i drank
[1:13:52] but nothing really stood out
[1:13:55] we did some research and it's like one
[1:13:57] in 12 14 million people get this
[1:14:00] technician some say it's hereditary
[1:14:03] no one in my family has it so how did i
[1:14:06] get it
[1:14:08] but they said nothing could be done
[1:14:10] except for a transplant
[1:14:12] and that's the organ that's affected
[1:14:14] which is the liver
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:19] me being the only one that
[1:14:21] had this disease
[1:14:24] it was
[1:14:26] to me
[1:14:27] knowing that i never drank a stitch in
[1:14:29] my life i had maybe i had my grandpa was
[1:14:31] an alcoholic on my mom's side and he um
[1:14:36] he gave a little shot glass when we were
[1:14:37] about seven or eight years old said to
[1:14:39] all the grandkids try this i could not
[1:14:42] stand that stuff i said never will i
[1:14:44] touch that stuff and that was the only
[1:14:46] time i had something like that
[1:14:48] and um
[1:14:50] never smoked
[1:14:51] he kept me from that he kept me from
[1:14:53] that
[1:14:54] because i certainly had friends that did
[1:14:56] all of that stuff
[1:14:59] and um
[1:15:02] since 2009 the doctors just was just
[1:15:05] starting to do exams and preps for
[1:15:07] surgery
[1:15:09] i was on
[1:15:10] various types of medications
[1:15:13] to help my system to just calm down
[1:15:16] get the jaundice under control the
[1:15:18] yellowness under control
[1:15:20] um
[1:15:22] and in 2009 2011
[1:15:26] i i was i had almost died
[1:15:31] when that uh
[1:15:32] done the procedure uh colonoscopy
[1:15:34] normally
[1:15:35] causes that side effect and i had a
[1:15:38] severe fever
[1:15:41] and
[1:15:42] i had to be rushed back to the hospital
[1:15:45] with
[1:15:47] that somehow that cut my esophagus which
[1:15:50] is your third year and the toxins in my
[1:15:52] body the bile or the
[1:15:56] the the the filth got into my system
[1:16:01] and there was supposed to be cleanse my
[1:16:03] my liver that came into my system and i
[1:16:04] started to just yeah
[1:16:06] got into my bloodstream and
[1:16:09] that was a very severe reaction almost
[1:16:11] like something that you had
[1:16:13] but um
[1:16:14] yeah it's along that lines
[1:16:16] just to make it a little easier to
[1:16:17] understand
[1:16:19] you know
[1:16:22] so then
[1:16:24] that was 2011.
[1:16:28] so during that time
[1:16:30] we were planning on buying a home in
[1:16:32] ohio we weren't planning on moving
[1:16:35] there was uh my dad had started a
[1:16:36] fellowship there
[1:16:38] and um
[1:16:40] we were doing good
[1:16:41] everything was going fine
[1:16:45] and then i got sick
[1:16:48] so i had to be in the hospital in and
[1:16:50] out of the hospital every three four
[1:16:52] months i'd be
[1:16:53] so obviously that started draining on
[1:16:55] our
[1:16:57] resources finances and stuff like that
[1:16:59] savings eventually was depleted and then
[1:17:02] the lord
[1:17:03] said to my wife and myself
[1:17:07] you i want you to move
[1:17:10] you couldn't have told me that last year
[1:17:12] lord when i had money
[1:17:14] now you want me to move
[1:17:17] um
[1:17:19] so we were planning i
[1:17:21] again the flesh man said we can go back
[1:17:23] to new york i know some friends i know
[1:17:25] buddies i can start up a business i can
[1:17:27] start a company and we'll be fine
[1:17:31] that didn't settle well with me because
[1:17:33] i've learned one thing for sure
[1:17:35] watch the hand of god look to him
[1:17:38] and he'll direct your path that's what
[1:17:39] his word declares so i've he's taught me
[1:17:42] well to look to him because i don't want
[1:17:44] to make the same mistakes
[1:17:46] you learn you learn fast
[1:17:48] at school of god's hard knocks knocks
[1:17:50] you straight up
[1:17:53] and
[1:17:56] then we thought well maybe georgia
[1:17:58] maybe tennessee could have gone to
[1:18:01] a few other believers fellowships and
[1:18:05] then my work decided to send me here to
[1:18:07] texas
[1:18:08] um to houston
[1:18:10] for some um uh
[1:18:12] continued training and education at a
[1:18:14] facility out there
[1:18:17] and my my wife's sister came in a friend
[1:18:20] of ours
[1:18:21] and so we all got in the van and
[1:18:24] the work my company then paid for
[1:18:26] everything
[1:18:27] they paid for the hotel the fuel
[1:18:29] anything i would have expenses they they
[1:18:32] covered it all i watched the hand of god
[1:18:35] they paid for everything even if i
[1:18:37] called them and said while i paid this
[1:18:39] i didn't want them to pay for everything
[1:18:41] they insisted
[1:18:44] so we went to houston and we stayed at
[1:18:46] the hotel and then my aunt lives here in
[1:18:48] hearst and
[1:18:49] i told my wife i said you know we've
[1:18:51] been praying about coming this way and
[1:18:54] when we entered
[1:18:56] the borders of texas
[1:18:58] my wife and myself just looked at each
[1:19:00] other at the same time and we both at
[1:19:03] that same time felt a peace
[1:19:05] come over us
[1:19:07] so knowing that the lord had said move
[1:19:11] we weren't sure where but we had
[1:19:13] thoughts and when we came here
[1:19:15] that peace his peace overtook us and we
[1:19:18] thought okay well this is where
[1:19:20] he wants us to be maybe it's in houston
[1:19:22] so we
[1:19:24] uh tried to find out from voice of god
[1:19:26] if there were any churches in houston or
[1:19:28] fellowships and they didn't come back um
[1:19:31] it was just
[1:19:33] no responses
[1:19:36] and
[1:19:39] then my wife came to visit my auntie and
[1:19:41] hearst and she called me she said darren
[1:19:44] remember that feeling you had when we
[1:19:46] entered in and i had the same feeling i
[1:19:48] said yeah
[1:19:49] she said well i just had the same
[1:19:51] feeling you're in hearst
[1:19:52] i said well that's strange okay
[1:19:55] well find it if there's a fellowship
[1:19:57] around here
[1:19:59] and again we reached out to voice of god
[1:20:01] and
[1:20:02] they said there's quite a few churches
[1:20:04] and understandably
[1:20:06] they couldn't point you in a specific
[1:20:08] church direction because then it would
[1:20:09] look like brother
[1:20:11] they said you must go there and that's
[1:20:12] where you'll stay
[1:20:14] you've got to follow the leadership of
[1:20:15] the holy spirit
[1:20:17] at all times
[1:20:19] and we didn't know about the church here
[1:20:21] we didn't know about the fellowship here
[1:20:23] never met brother david never heard
[1:20:24] about brother david
[1:20:27] before and um
[1:20:31] yeah so when i came here
[1:20:34] to visit my aunt my wife was still here
[1:20:36] that same piece over kb
[1:20:39] so now we knew okay he wants us in
[1:20:42] texas
[1:20:44] somewhere in the area of dallas where
[1:20:46] exactly we're not sure yet
[1:20:49] so we went back up to ohio and in 2015
[1:20:53] i got really really sick and my liver
[1:20:56] started failing
[1:20:57] you know you open up a shower and and
[1:20:59] you put a cloth there and the water just
[1:21:01] comes right on through
[1:21:02] that's how my liver was everything i'd
[1:21:04] eat or drink would just go right on
[1:21:06] through nothing got cleansed nothing
[1:21:10] got
[1:21:11] processed right so it was just a serve
[1:21:14] just letting everything go through right
[1:21:15] through so
[1:21:18] and in 2015 when i got sick
[1:21:20] my family had the flu at the same time i
[1:21:22] thought i had the flu
[1:21:24] so it was around 2 am
[1:21:27] my wife looked at me and she said i
[1:21:29] looked pale i was sitting in the bath
[1:21:31] in the bathroom on the edge of the bath
[1:21:33] and they're
[1:21:34] hunched over usually when i sit like
[1:21:36] that i'm in a lot of pain
[1:21:40] but i was hot and i didn't know how to
[1:21:42] cool down and you know with the
[1:21:44] with the liver
[1:21:46] or or some of the organs inside on the
[1:21:47] inside of your body
[1:21:49] you put your feet in the ice cold tub of
[1:21:51] ice or water and those things just seem
[1:21:54] to somehow just shrink the organs
[1:21:57] shrinks
[1:21:58] slowly but it shrinks over time
[1:22:01] and
[1:22:04] my wife asked me at the time should i
[1:22:05] should you call on 911. i said okay go
[1:22:07] ahead
[1:22:10] so
[1:22:12] in 2014 let me go back there again we
[1:22:15] had eventually moved down here we still
[1:22:16] haven't come to the fellowship here
[1:22:19] we didn't know about the church we'd
[1:22:20] gone to
[1:22:21] brother david is going to get me for
[1:22:23] this one again
[1:22:24] we went to a little baptist church here
[1:22:26] in collierville first baptist church
[1:22:28] over there
[1:22:29] and
[1:22:31] we had
[1:22:32] communion there
[1:22:34] and i took the communion and i just
[1:22:36] shook my head i told my office i said i
[1:22:37] can't do this anymore
[1:22:39] we've got to find where god wants us to
[1:22:41] be because this is not working
[1:22:43] because they're taking
[1:22:45] the body and blood of jesus christ
[1:22:47] without knowing what he really is about
[1:22:51] and um
[1:22:52] anyway so coming back to where my wife
[1:22:55] called the 911 we
[1:22:57] we eventually went to
[1:22:58] the medical city um hospital year in
[1:23:01] just not too far from here
[1:23:03] um you can see it off the highway
[1:23:05] so while i was laying there someone
[1:23:08] in the next room or the next bed at
[1:23:10] least because you're now sitting in the
[1:23:12] er
[1:23:14] they were trying to revive this person
[1:23:16] well that person had passed away
[1:23:19] while they were trying to revive him
[1:23:22] and myself and my wife just looked at
[1:23:23] each other and
[1:23:26] we both thought well that's the right
[1:23:28] place to come because
[1:23:29] they shouldn't they striking out the air
[1:23:31] man
[1:23:33] there's one gun in our mind next
[1:23:38] so my cousin came over and he's the er
[1:23:40] doc alvin and he said let's go over to
[1:23:42] baylor in grapevine he knew some people
[1:23:45] there and got me in real quick and told
[1:23:48] them
[1:23:49] what happened
[1:23:50] you know god has a purpose in everything
[1:23:54] and sister allen oh she's not here
[1:23:55] tonight she worked there
[1:23:57] i didn't know that
[1:23:59] but god has a purpose in everything we
[1:24:01] wanted to get to the fellowship hall
[1:24:03] didn't know where it was
[1:24:06] so um
[1:24:08] my wife called her dad
[1:24:12] to find out if he knew about a place of
[1:24:14] fellowship that we can go here
[1:24:17] in dallas
[1:24:19] and he said no he's never been to texas
[1:24:22] but he knows someone that knows dallas
[1:24:25] real well
[1:24:26] and brother brown's son-in-law brother
[1:24:28] george smith was at his house having
[1:24:31] lunch
[1:24:32] and he told us about brother david and
[1:24:34] the fellowship year
[1:24:36] so you can imagine our surprise it
[1:24:38] wasn't too far not even 10 minutes away
[1:24:40] we never knew
[1:24:42] but that's how god works small things
[1:24:44] that he moves in his time
[1:24:49] and uh
[1:24:52] i've never spoken to brother david at
[1:24:54] all the first service i remember having
[1:24:57] come here to was um
[1:25:00] ice met with brother matt
[1:25:02] brother matthew yeah matthew brother
[1:25:04] matt thomas i got you in the little
[1:25:07] green little porch you remember that
[1:25:08] matt you remember that and matthew was
[1:25:11] still teasing me said i said well i'm i
[1:25:14] was on my way to brother um
[1:25:16] isaac noriegas that's where i wanted to
[1:25:18] go
[1:25:19] and matthew still said why do you want
[1:25:21] to go down there this is where the world
[1:25:22] is at
[1:25:26] so you know god works he works he might
[1:25:30] he's kept that in my thought with my
[1:25:32] thought process my memory since that
[1:25:34] time for a purpose
[1:25:36] you know
[1:25:38] and um
[1:25:42] my wife eventually called brother david
[1:25:44] and spoke to him
[1:25:46] and um
[1:25:48] she of course had to first explain who
[1:25:49] we were
[1:25:50] then brother david remembers all that
[1:25:53] but
[1:26:16] you within yourself know that you have
[1:26:18] nothing
[1:26:20] you just saved by god's grace
[1:26:24] your dust of the earth
[1:26:26] and he makes these ways possible
[1:26:29] and then
[1:26:30] you know
[1:26:39] my wife spoke to brother david and and
[1:26:42] if you wonder why
[1:26:43] i'm so
[1:26:44] appreciative brother david you'll hear
[1:26:47] about it in a few minutes
[1:26:49] just give me a few minutes to calm down
[1:26:51] and settle down
[1:26:52] but david doesn't like this but
[1:26:55] it's my turn now
[1:27:06] that evening david was at the hospital
[1:27:09] never met him before
[1:27:12] normally
[1:27:13] a pastor of a church this size would
[1:27:15] send one of his deacons or someone to
[1:27:17] just go and find out who they were or
[1:27:20] just go pray with them and that's it
[1:27:22] but he came himself
[1:27:24] so i appreciate that brother david very
[1:27:26] much
[1:27:33] so that's when he also met my cousin
[1:27:34] there at the hospital sound he found out
[1:27:36] the severity of my condition
[1:27:39] i don't recall everything that happened
[1:27:40] that day as you can tell i mean
[1:27:43] this here
[1:27:44] these things my wife put together she
[1:27:46] has an excellent memory
[1:27:49] i had a memory in that long long gone
[1:27:53] you know
[1:27:57] my esophagus which is your throat
[1:27:59] pipe or
[1:28:00] the pipe that's down here from your
[1:28:01] throat down
[1:28:03] i perforated and i started bleeding top
[1:28:05] and bottom
[1:28:07] they couldn't understand what was going
[1:28:09] on
[1:28:10] and i had to perform the emergency
[1:28:12] surgery i coded and coding means you had
[1:28:15] passed away some of the nurses know what
[1:28:16] that is you just flatline
[1:28:19] and
[1:28:21] now my cousin at the time
[1:28:23] we were both getting ready to go to to
[1:28:25] to take the mcat to get into med school
[1:28:29] and he doesn't get he doesn't get shaken
[1:28:31] by much because we've seen a lot while
[1:28:33] we grew up in south africa
[1:28:36] and
[1:28:38] i saw his eyes
[1:28:40] go real real huge he was sitting across
[1:28:43] from me
[1:28:44] i knew i was in trouble because alvin
[1:28:46] never gives away what he's feeling and
[1:28:48] this time he couldn't hide it
[1:28:52] and
[1:28:53] he told me
[1:28:54] my wife to
[1:28:56] contact my sister and my brother
[1:28:59] and family to to come
[1:29:04] when i saw the look on my wife's face
[1:29:06] the concern she had i was like oh boy
[1:29:07] i'm in trouble again
[1:29:10] and
[1:29:12] all of through all of that
[1:29:14] we still had our four kids we had the
[1:29:16] girls now
[1:29:18] and
[1:29:22] the boys were taking care of the girls
[1:29:24] which i really appreciate you know i
[1:29:25] never said i can't say thank you enough
[1:29:27] to them
[1:29:28] for what they've done within our family
[1:29:30] for my wife for what she's done
[1:29:32] and now she's taking care of us and
[1:29:34] taking care of me through it all
[1:29:36] through thick and thin
[1:29:38] um she was there truly god blessed me
[1:29:41] with a wonderful wonderful wife
[1:29:44] and
[1:29:46] my cousin stayed with me then
[1:29:50] and then um
[1:29:54] we can fast forward to wednesday april
[1:29:56] the 6th 2016.
[1:29:59] now before all of that brother david had
[1:30:01] organized a blood drive with the carter
[1:30:04] blood drive system
[1:30:06] and i appreciate him for that as well
[1:30:08] he didn't have to do anything like that
[1:30:10] but yet he desired to do it
[1:30:13] and i appreciate it the believers the
[1:30:15] brothers and sisters here that helped us
[1:30:17] through that period i really really
[1:30:19] appreciate it god is my witness and my
[1:30:21] judge i thank you from the bottom of my
[1:30:23] heart
[1:30:25] you know
[1:30:27] april the sixth
[1:30:28] six years ago to this date
[1:30:31] this day
[1:30:35] um
[1:30:36] it was found that
[1:30:38] i was eligible for a liver transplant
[1:30:43] i got the call we got the call late the
[1:30:45] afternoon and
[1:30:47] around midnight i said i'm gonna go
[1:30:49] sleep i'm just tired
[1:30:51] if i'm if i'm the one that must get the
[1:30:53] transplant wonderful there was another
[1:30:55] person before me
[1:30:57] and then at
[1:31:00] two
[1:31:00] two
[1:31:01] they called
[1:31:03] and we had to leave the house at 3am so
[1:31:05] yeah it was around two that they called
[1:31:06] and said you're the one that the
[1:31:09] delivery will be given to we need at the
[1:31:11] hospital and we're doing the procedure
[1:31:12] today that is now
[1:31:14] the seventh
[1:31:16] so
[1:31:19] my wife called brother david we called
[1:31:20] brother david and sister leslie and they
[1:31:22] prayed with us
[1:31:24] so you can see the hand of a pastor a
[1:31:26] real pastor a shepherd of the flock
[1:31:28] taking care of his sheep
[1:31:29] through it all i'm not just talking
[1:31:30] about my lives i watched brother david
[1:31:33] when we started coming i was watching
[1:31:35] him
[1:31:37] and his interaction with the people he
[1:31:39] has
[1:31:40] a
[1:31:41] deep set love
[1:31:43] like he said to you on sunday to all of
[1:31:45] us at least on sunday
[1:31:47] because of his love he doesn't step up
[1:31:49] to the plate sometimes to say certain
[1:31:50] things that might be hurtful it's
[1:31:52] because he loves us so much and i thank
[1:31:54] god for that in our pastor
[1:31:58] you know and
[1:32:01] certainly appreciate how brother david
[1:32:03] and sister leslie rallied to help us out
[1:32:07] so that day
[1:32:09] i remember i was in the hospital
[1:32:11] brother david came over there and
[1:32:13] brother aaron i think brother matthew
[1:32:15] was also there a few other brothers that
[1:32:17] i can't remember if i don't remember
[1:32:19] your name forgive me i'm really sorry
[1:32:21] oh let me go back while i was in the
[1:32:23] hospital you're at in grapevine brother
[1:32:26] tommy and brother
[1:32:28] andy came to minister to me and to
[1:32:31] anoint me with oil and pray for me while
[1:32:33] i was sick there and i appreciate that
[1:32:34] as well
[1:32:35] it's really been a blessing i always
[1:32:38] when i'm sitting by myself just me and
[1:32:39] my thoughts and i can thank god for all
[1:32:42] these things that's been done
[1:32:43] it really is an eye-opener of how will
[1:32:45] they know
[1:32:47] that you are my disciples it's when you
[1:32:48] have love one for one another you know
[1:32:52] and it's beyond just words it's in
[1:32:53] action
[1:32:56] and um
[1:32:57] that day brother david still whispered
[1:32:59] in my ear he said hey don't worry
[1:33:01] everything is taken care of
[1:33:14] i told brother david i said brother
[1:33:15] david
[1:33:16] he raises me up from that operating
[1:33:19] table
[1:33:20] i'm ready if he doesn't i'm still ready
[1:33:24] because i know i've given my all to him
[1:33:29] and my family would be well taken care
[1:33:30] of by him
[1:33:31] here at our local fellowship and i thank
[1:33:33] the lord for that
[1:33:35] that i've we found a place where we can
[1:33:37] just be ourselves
[1:33:39] and be at peace and know that
[1:33:41] we're part of this end time bride
[1:33:46] about a year after my transplant
[1:33:49] i don't recall what happened on the day
[1:33:50] of the transplant i never miss my baby
[1:33:54] gabby's birthday
[1:33:56] as the only one i missed
[1:33:58] so if i always say thank you for their
[1:34:00] birthdays
[1:34:01] it's because of this very testimony
[1:34:04] because he's given me grace to see it
[1:34:06] and enjoy every one of them as they grew
[1:34:08] up and i can see the hand of god in
[1:34:10] their lives
[1:34:13] and
[1:34:17] yeah after about a year after my
[1:34:18] transplant i had another complication
[1:34:22] where the bile ducts that sits on your
[1:34:24] liver on the side of your liver there
[1:34:27] um they had to perform surgery and put a
[1:34:29] stent in it because it kept on
[1:34:30] collapsing so that would force the
[1:34:32] poison back into my body
[1:34:34] get into my bloodstream that could kill
[1:34:37] me make me jaundiced again and all that
[1:34:38] stuff
[1:34:39] so i had a tube coming out of
[1:34:42] my rib cage here
[1:34:43] and during that time i was working with
[1:34:45] with brother cosman
[1:34:48] doing the over-the-road stuff
[1:34:50] i was in
[1:34:52] i was in pennsylvania now in georgia
[1:34:55] one time sitting there in the this
[1:34:58] restaurant and
[1:35:00] the er squad came in rushing in
[1:35:03] and i'm sitting there and they
[1:35:05] um giving cpr to a man choking
[1:35:08] and i'm sitting here thinking man you're
[1:35:11] so far from home what if that happens to
[1:35:13] you and i've got a tube coming out here
[1:35:15] that i have to clean every time
[1:35:17] god knows how to break you down and and
[1:35:19] make you realize he is in charge i mean
[1:35:22] i feel sorry for uh nebuchadnezzar
[1:35:25] that i had to run around naked as an
[1:35:27] animal eat the grass and the weeds
[1:35:29] because he was fighting with god i said
[1:35:30] lord don't let me get to that point ever
[1:35:34] i can be mule-headed but don't let me
[1:35:35] get there please lord have mercy
[1:35:38] you know
[1:35:40] currently i'm on six different
[1:35:41] medications
[1:35:43] and i do get migraines because of these
[1:35:45] medications it's one of the side effects
[1:35:48] but you know i was i was sitting down
[1:35:51] the other day and i was just thinking
[1:35:54] this is um
[1:35:56] brother brown says
[1:35:58] those are demons i didn't invite them
[1:36:01] into my home i didn't invite them into
[1:36:03] my body
[1:36:04] but they do attack me
[1:36:08] and jesus christ said by stripes i've
[1:36:10] been healed
[1:36:12] so i'm grateful for the healing but i'm
[1:36:14] waiting for the deliverance
[1:36:16] of that
[1:36:18] i'm grateful for the liver but i'm
[1:36:20] waiting for the transformation
[1:36:23] of this vile body
[1:36:26] you know as part of this end time right
[1:36:28] so keep me in prayer
[1:36:30] so i can get away from those headaches
[1:36:32] i'll read a few quotes here just to end
[1:36:34] this off
[1:36:35] i thank the lord for your patience i
[1:36:36] really do appreciate it
[1:36:39] out of the book
[1:36:41] victory day preaching 63
[1:36:44] 421
[1:36:46] the first paragraph is 178.
[1:36:49] now remember when god has counted you
[1:36:52] worthy
[1:36:53] when you have a test
[1:36:56] now don't fail this
[1:36:58] to get this
[1:36:59] when you have a trial or a test it shows
[1:37:02] the grace of god as found
[1:37:04] you found favor with god
[1:37:08] and i stop and i think and i look at
[1:37:09] that how could i have found favor with
[1:37:12] god i'm just dust of the earth
[1:37:14] was inflation nowadays i'm probably not
[1:37:16] even worth a penny
[1:37:20] and i'll continue reading here and he
[1:37:21] said and god believes that you stand the
[1:37:24] test
[1:37:25] well he believes that you stand not just
[1:37:28] me you too
[1:37:29] he believes that you stand this test
[1:37:32] how does he know that it's because he's
[1:37:34] in you he promised it
[1:37:37] you remember he did the same thing to
[1:37:39] job
[1:37:41] satan said oh yes
[1:37:43] i seen job down there just put your name
[1:37:45] in there
[1:37:46] i said i see

[1:38:04] brother matthew he's a perfect servant
[1:38:07] there's none in earth like him
[1:38:10] there's nobody
[1:38:12] nobody like job he's a perfect man
[1:38:17] now he's he's my he's my pride and joy
[1:38:22] satan said oh sure he gets everything he
[1:38:24] asks for
[1:38:26] said let me have him once
[1:38:28] and said i'll make him curse you to your
[1:38:31] face said i'll just make him curse you
[1:38:34] god said he's in your hands
[1:38:37] but don't you take his life see
[1:38:40] god had confidence in job amen
[1:38:44] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:38:46] wrong
[1:38:47] god is giving you a trial
[1:38:50] he's got confidence in you he don't have
[1:38:53] to baby you around
[1:38:55] you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid
[1:38:58] you're a real
[1:39:00] christian
[1:39:01] god is giving you a test
[1:39:03] see what you do about it amen
[1:39:06] no wonder peter said
[1:39:08] these fiery trials
[1:39:10] why counting the joy
[1:39:12] it's it's more precious to you than gold
[1:39:15] i can say amen to that
[1:39:17] then another one here
[1:39:23] it is the rising of the sun preaching 65
[1:39:26] 418.
[1:39:28] start in paragraph 40.
[1:39:31] the sun it was bringing a message that
[1:39:34] there will be life upon the earth mortal
[1:39:36] life
[1:39:37] to bring eternal life to all god's
[1:39:40] promised seed
[1:39:42] that by foreknowledge he had seen
[1:39:45] laying upon the earth no more could
[1:39:48] the botany life live back there at the
[1:39:51] beginning without the s-u-n to bring you
[1:39:53] to life
[1:39:54] no more than today when sons of god is
[1:39:57] upon the earth he's talking about us you
[1:39:59] and me
[1:40:01] it takes the s-o-n light to bring them
[1:40:04] to eternal life
[1:40:06] he's chosen ones that he knew
[1:40:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:40:11] that's what we heard on sunday
[1:40:13] and wednesday he had chosen them in
[1:40:15] himself before the foundation of the
[1:40:17] world and on easter morning then
[1:40:20] in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies
[1:40:23] at that time
[1:40:24] and in heaven there was a book of memory
[1:40:27] and his attributes was eating
[1:40:29] knowing that because this son of god
[1:40:32] raised
[1:40:33] it would also raise to life every sun
[1:40:36] that was for ordained to do this
[1:40:39] great time
[1:40:41] he knew it would be
[1:40:43] and what a more glorious sunrise that
[1:40:46] was
[1:40:48] hold on here let me go back
[1:40:53] okay
[1:40:56] where did it go now
[1:41:04] hold on there
[1:41:12] that was
[1:41:14] then it was at the beginning at time
[1:41:17] when it first dawned
[1:41:20] he's talking about this end time
[1:41:22] then in paragraph 196
[1:41:25] you're resurrected right then your body
[1:41:28] is potentially resurrected
[1:41:30] look at a little seed planted in the
[1:41:33] ground it has to drink from the his
[1:41:36] foundation
[1:41:37] from his fountain the waters that pours
[1:41:39] down and as it drinks it pushes up
[1:41:42] towards him
[1:41:43] coming more like the likeness of the sea
[1:41:46] that went into the ground see
[1:41:49] the church has come that way through
[1:41:51] justification sanctification
[1:41:54] baptism of the holy ghost now in the
[1:41:56] blossom
[1:41:58] the spirit of god comes through that
[1:42:00] and the spirit of the world
[1:42:02] has come through the antichrist the same
[1:42:04] way
[1:42:07] if that spur this is 2 15 if that spirit
[1:42:09] that raised up jesus from the dead from
[1:42:12] the dead
[1:42:13] dwells in you oh hallelujah
[1:42:17] your body ain't subject to sun to sin no
[1:42:19] more

[1:42:23] over here
[1:42:25] nope not for me see my desires has
[1:42:27] changed my appetite is different
[1:42:30] for man shall not live on the world are
[1:42:32] caring alone but by every word
[1:42:35] that proceeds out of the mouth of god a
[1:42:37] genuine
[1:42:38] quickened eagle lives by that amen so
[1:42:42] god bless you may this testimony you
[1:42:44] heard this evening be an encouragement
[1:42:45] to each one of you
[1:42:47] i hope it
[1:42:49] lingers around with you that god is the
[1:42:52] same yesterday today if the musicians
[1:42:54] could come brother david
[1:43:23] we certainly
[1:43:26] appreciate
[1:43:27] his steadfastness
[1:43:29] for the lord
[1:43:31] you know a lot of times as the pastor
[1:43:33] you
[1:43:36] get credit for things but
[1:43:39] when darien laid there he had rent to
[1:43:41] pay he had bills to pay he had
[1:43:44] food to buy
[1:43:47] and all the believers pitched together
[1:43:50] and they all sacrificed
[1:43:55] and to the best of our ability we were
[1:43:59] not me
[1:44:01] we
[1:44:02] we don't have no whees
[1:44:04] eyes big eyes
[1:44:06] and little ears
[1:44:08] we have us
[1:44:09] a body fitted and joined together and
[1:44:13] standing together one for another and
[1:44:17] and
[1:44:19] you know
[1:44:21] like abraham you know he wasn't going to
[1:44:23] let
[1:44:25] his nephew be taken away he
[1:44:29] hit the plowshares and turned them into
[1:44:31] swords and
[1:44:33] went and rescued his own
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:36] and
[1:44:37] darion was on the
[1:44:39] edge of death
[1:44:42] even before
[1:44:44] he got word on his liver transplanted
[1:44:47] it wasn't like oh he was just waiting in
[1:44:49] line no
[1:44:51] they told them if you don't get a liver
[1:44:54] in 30 days
[1:44:57] goodbye
[1:44:59] and the body went to praying and
[1:45:03] when you have a liver transplant you
[1:45:05] don't go to work the next day
[1:45:08] you know what i mean your wife can't go
[1:45:10] to work the next day because you don't
[1:45:12] have nobody to take care of your
[1:45:14] children
[1:45:15] but the body of the lord jesus christ
[1:45:18] stepped up for one of its own
[1:45:21] amen and
[1:45:23] we got him through that
[1:45:25] hard time i didn't get him through that
[1:45:27] hard time the body
[1:45:29] got them through the hard time with
[1:45:31] their money with their prayers
[1:45:33] with their offerings
[1:45:35] with
[1:45:36] everything that they could do to
[1:45:40] get him back on his feet and by the
[1:45:42] grace of god
[1:45:43] he used us all
[1:45:46] he used us all
[1:45:48] to help our brother
[1:45:50] and
[1:45:51] all i can say is that
[1:45:57] it was him
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:00] you know he moves on your heart
[1:46:02] sometimes he puts a
[1:46:04] burden on your heart for somebody he
[1:46:07] he
[1:46:09] tells you to give of your time
[1:46:12] and that's the only way that the lord
[1:46:14] has to show himself
[1:46:16] is through flesh
[1:46:18] and the flesh he chooses to show himself
[1:46:22] through is
[1:46:23] your flesh
[1:46:25] and that's why it's so important to be
[1:46:27] sensitive
[1:46:28] to the unction of the holy spirit
[1:46:32] and the sacrifice
[1:46:34] and i believe that
[1:46:37] god brought him
[1:46:38] here because he knew there'd be a body
[1:46:40] here
[1:46:42] that would join in with him and
[1:46:46] help him and his family in the time of
[1:46:48] need and
[1:46:49] and the believers did that
[1:46:52] and uh
[1:46:54] and i think that
[1:46:56] it's all to the credit of god working
[1:46:58] together in the body
[1:47:02] making the word of god
[1:47:04] come of life
[1:47:06] every member supplying the need
[1:47:09] of the other
[1:47:11] fitted and joined together
[1:47:13] and that's really
[1:47:16] what this testimony
[1:47:19] is so much about
[1:47:21] it's about
[1:47:22] god bringing him to a body
[1:47:26] that fitted and joined with him
[1:47:29] and supplied the need
[1:47:31] that he has
[1:47:33] and
[1:47:34] that gift of this body
[1:47:38] doesn't die
[1:47:39] and end with brother darien it moves on
[1:47:42] to the next case
[1:47:44] and the next case
[1:47:46] and the next case
[1:47:48] until one day we all make it together
[1:47:51] amen and like we say we're not going to
[1:47:54] leave anybody behind
[1:47:56] we'll do all that we can one for another
[1:47:59] because as our brother quoted
[1:48:02] they'll know that you are my disciples
[1:48:05] by your love
[1:48:07] one for another so let's stand this
[1:48:09] evening and
[1:48:12] is this a song you're playing that's on
[1:48:14] my thing you know
[1:48:17] go ahead take the microphone
[1:48:19] let's just bow our head in prayer and
[1:48:21] give the lord thanks
[1:48:24] and then we'll sing the song before
[1:48:26] we're dismissed
[1:48:29] let us bow our hearts
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:35] and maybe
[1:48:37] as you reflect this evening
[1:48:42] maybe in your heart you'll ask your
[1:48:44] heart
[1:48:45] do i live for others
[1:48:49] do i reach down and give of myself
[1:48:54] am i aware of
[1:48:56] the people around me that are in need
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:02] am i willing to trust my well-being into
[1:49:05] the hands of the lord that
[1:49:08] i can live for others
[1:49:11] because you'll never out-give the lord
[1:49:15] our heavenly father as we come before
[1:49:18] you and
[1:49:20] our brother wanted to testify of
[1:49:24] your mighty love towards him
[1:49:29] and lord there is no way that he could
[1:49:31] describe how
[1:49:34] seriously ill
[1:49:36] he was
[1:49:40] father to the point that
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:45] man's scientific machines could no
[1:49:48] longer record life in his body
[1:49:54] because there was no life there to
[1:49:56] record
[1:49:59] but lord you came on the scene
[1:50:04] and you restored his
[1:50:08] life lord and you gave him a spirit that
[1:50:12] never complained
[1:50:15] never gave up
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:19] lord and you've
[1:50:21] joined him with a body that fought
[1:50:24] hand in hand with him
[1:50:27] lord and we love him
[1:50:30] he's a part of us
[1:50:32] he's one of us lord and
[1:50:34] we want to be in the rapture with him we
[1:50:38] all want to go together
[1:50:40] lord we always want to have that spirit
[1:50:43] father that we love one another that
[1:50:46] we're a part of one another and when one
[1:50:48] has a burden we all have a burden
[1:50:51] and when one rejoices we all rejoice
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:57] lord we praise you tonight
[1:51:00] and worship you
[1:51:02] for how that you kept our
[1:51:04] brethren how that you supplied his needs
[1:51:08] and
[1:51:09] how that you provided father
[1:51:14] someone gave life that he might have
[1:51:16] life
[1:51:18] father the families
[1:51:22] of the donor lord god we ask you bless
[1:51:25] them
[1:51:27] father because we've been blessed by
[1:51:29] that sacrifice
[1:51:33] and lord i
[1:51:34] asked father that
[1:51:37] our charity and love one for another
[1:51:40] would increase
[1:51:42] and that we would learn to understand
[1:51:44] what's important in life
[1:51:47] it's the little things
[1:51:51] and when you come to a spot that you
[1:51:53] don't
[1:51:54] have anything
[1:51:56] as our brother testified and just
[1:51:59] wondering whether you will breathe
[1:52:02] is what's important
[1:52:05] it sure lets you know
[1:52:09] what's important
[1:52:11] and father
[1:52:13] our sister alana how
[1:52:16] much she's a part of this testimony
[1:52:20] never wavering
[1:52:22] never not having faith
[1:52:25] never complaining and never giving up
[1:52:29] father when we look at this fine
[1:52:31] christian family
[1:52:35] may we understand the trials that
[1:52:39] gave them the character that they have
[1:52:42] and may we be willing father to have
[1:52:45] this character in our life
[1:52:47] that whatever path you lead us down lord
[1:52:50] jesus
[1:52:52] we will lift our hands
[1:52:54] and we will praise your name
[1:52:58] we'll give you the honor and the glory
[1:53:00] and the good times
[1:53:02] we'll give you the honor and the glory
[1:53:04] and the bad times
[1:53:06] and we will always look up for we know
[1:53:09] our redeemer liveth
[1:53:12] and we will praise him
[1:53:14] and glorify his name
[1:53:17] for he is the same
[1:53:19] yesterday
[1:53:21] today
