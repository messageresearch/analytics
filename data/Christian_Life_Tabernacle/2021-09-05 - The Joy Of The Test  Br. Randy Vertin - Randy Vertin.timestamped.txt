[41:45] if we could to a couple places of
[41:48] scripture here
[41:49] in the book of first peter chapter one
[42:03] and then we're also going to go back a
[42:05] book from that to the book of james
[42:07] chapter one as well
[42:14] in first peter chapter one we'll start
[42:16] reading at verse three
[42:25] blessed be the god and father of our
[42:27] lord jesus christ which according to his
[42:29] abundant mercy hath begotten us
[42:32] again unto a lively hope by the
[42:34] resurrection of jesus christ from the
[42:36] dead
[42:36] to an inheritance incorruptible and
[42:38] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[42:41] reserved in heaven for you
[42:43] who are kept by the power of god through
[42:45] faith unto salvation ready to be
[42:48] revealed in the last time
[42:50] wherein ye greatly rejoice though now
[42:52] for a season if need be you are in
[42:55] heaviness through manifold temptations
[42:57] that the trial of your faith being more
[42:59] precious than
[43:00] of gold that perisheth though it be
[43:02] tried with fire
[43:04] might be found unto praise and honor and
[43:06] glory at the appearing of jesus christ
[43:09] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[43:12] though now you see him not yet believing
[43:15] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[43:18] of glory
[43:19] receiving the end of your faith even the
[43:21] salvation of your souls amen and we'll
[43:24] turn back here to james chapter 1
[43:28] and we'll jesus just read
[43:31] verses 1 through 4
[43:33] and i think you'll maybe see kind of a
[43:35] theme
[43:37] it says james a servant of god and of
[43:40] the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes
[43:42] which are scattered abroad greeting
[43:44] my brethren counted all joy when you
[43:46] fall into diverse temptations
[43:49] knowing this that the trying of your
[43:51] faith worketh patience
[43:53] but let patience have her perfect work
[43:55] that ye may be perfect and entire
[43:58] wanting nothing
[44:00] amen let's just go before the lord
[44:01] heavenly father
[44:04] lord our we just love you so much lord

[44:13] lord to receive something from you this
[44:15] evening god
[44:16] knowing lord that we can't come into
[44:18] your presence and go out the same
[44:20] but lord our hearts desire lord is that
[44:22] we just cleave even more closely unto
[44:24] you lord seeing that the hour is late

[44:35] that that great body change that we're
[44:37] looking forward to lord
[44:38] but lord let us just as we're even

[44:51] quickly lord to to put it underneath the
[44:54] blood lord and to let that blood lord

[45:00] evening asking that you would speak to

[45:05] are lord our pastor traveling lord to

[45:23] that would be traveling to minister may
[45:24] strengthen him as well and lord hear
[45:27] lord you wouldn't forget us even here oh
[45:29] god that as we've come together lord at
[45:31] our posted duty this morning and this
[45:33] afternoon oh god that you would just
[45:34] bless each and every one meet them at
[45:36] the place that they're at right now we
[45:38] just commit the service to you in the
[45:39] name of jesus christ we pray amen
[45:42] amen you may be seated
[45:46] just wanted to speak
[45:47] uh
[45:48] i kind of had an idea or a thought and
[45:51] then the lord kind of changed it
[45:53] and i just wanted the thought that kind
[45:55] of came to my mind this morning when the
[45:57] lord kind of turned i was just
[45:59] fellowshipping you know with brother
[46:00] billy in the back before he came out and
[46:02] it's amazing you know the word of god is
[46:04] just infinite
[46:06] and and
[46:07] you know i believe brother branham even
[46:09] said it would be all eternity god just
[46:10] revealing himself to us you know
[46:12] revealing the different attributes of
[46:15] himself to us and we've only you know
[46:17] the things that we see on this side i
[46:19] believe we've only just barely scratched
[46:21] the surface
[46:22] and it's amazing how you can have an
[46:24] idea maybe something upon your heart and
[46:26] then
[46:27] as brother billy and i were talking how
[46:29] it just seems like everywhere you go in
[46:30] the word it's just a fork in the road
[46:32] you go down this path and it'll go this
[46:33] way and this path in it you're just
[46:35] trusting that that you're just following
[46:36] the the pillar of fire to lead us to
[46:38] where we would go so
[46:40] the the thought that the lord really
[46:41] impressed upon me if i could put it this
[46:43] way is is the joy of the test
[46:47] and
[46:49] it's such a
[46:51] it's such a paradoxical idea isn't it
[46:53] that that when how we could say count it
[46:55] all joy when you fall into diverse
[46:57] temptations
[46:58] but you know god
[47:01] when he's bringing when we realize when
[47:03] we start to realize what he's bringing
[47:05] us to
[47:06] in this age and i believe as we've heard
[47:08] our pastor minister and the different
[47:10] ones that have come through and
[47:11] ministered behind
[47:12] and the things that we're beginning to
[47:14] see
[47:15] what god is truly bringing us to and a
[47:18] manifestation it's not just
[47:22] a manifestation of just one little thing
[47:24] here or there but he's
[47:26] god is desiring to manifest his very
[47:28] life in you
[47:30] in a bride
[47:32] it's not just to be
[47:34] it wasn't it's not enough anymore to say
[47:36] oh we just had justification with luther
[47:39] or we had sanctification with wesley or
[47:42] some restoration of the gifts with the
[47:44] pentecostal move but god now is has
[47:47] brought it boiled it down to
[47:49] we call it
[47:50] the seed time
[47:52] to where the very life that went down in
[47:54] the beginning god is requiring that same
[47:57] life to come forth here at the end time
[48:00] we heard it ministered this morning our
[48:01] brother billy brought out how throughout
[48:04] the other ages we did rejoice when the
[48:06] blade sprung up we did rejoice when the
[48:08] tassel sprung up and when the stalk came
[48:10] up why because it was a manifestation of
[48:13] that life
[48:14] we rejoiced when when the the husk came
[48:17] out and the shock showed itself because
[48:19] why it was a manifestation that there
[48:21] was a life to come
[48:24] and yet in the age that we're in now
[48:26] being smitten out of laodicea we've
[48:28] heard the call come ye out
[48:31] from among them be separate don't be
[48:34] partakers of her plagues
[48:36] and we've heeded that call
[48:38] and with that call comes a greater
[48:41] expectation
[48:43] of where we're to come to because it's
[48:44] no longer enough just to have a tassel
[48:46] just to have a stalk just to have a
[48:48] shuck but he's requiring a seed
[48:52] in this hour a ver and what is the seed
[48:54] but it's the very life that went into
[48:56] the ground at the beginning
[48:58] and in order to prove
[49:02] what that seed is
[49:04] it has to come to a test
[49:06] it has to come to a testing time because
[49:08] god won't leave it up to just a guessing
[49:11] game he's not going to leave it just to
[49:13] a chance
[49:15] but he will prove
[49:18] the scripture says prove all things hold
[49:21] fast that which is good
[49:24] so god isn't just gonna leave it up in
[49:26] the air as to whether this is or whether
[49:29] it isn't see we know in our hearts that
[49:31] we've received a word
[49:34] but see
[49:35] with that
[49:36] comes a testing time
[49:38] it's required
[49:40] that any child that comes to god must go
[49:42] through a testing time
[49:44] abraham received the promise of god
[49:47] he said you're going to have a son
[49:49] you're going to be the father of many
[49:51] nations your seed will possess the gates
[49:53] of the enemy
[49:54] and yet with the receiving of that
[49:57] promise there came a necessity
[50:00] of a testing of that promise to see
[50:03] whether he would hold to it or rather he
[50:06] wouldn't
[50:08] and so that's what we're talking about
[50:09] we want to the joy of the test it seems
[50:12] like a paradoxical thing because we're
[50:14] going how many have gone through tests
[50:16] and trials right now
[50:17] we're falling into too many tests and
[50:20] many trials and temptations and trials
[50:23] of our faith
[50:25] and that the instinct the the the nature
[50:28] of the flesh
[50:29] as we've discussed this many times is to
[50:31] throw up our hands and say why me
[50:34] why do i have to go through the test but
[50:35] see that's the flesh man talking
[50:38] because there's a seed down on the
[50:39] inside of the inside of you
[50:41] that knows
[50:43] who it is
[50:45] that knows
[50:46] the nature and the the power that is
[50:50] latent and inside of it
[50:52] the very word power that lays in you
[50:56] that was planted before the foundational
[50:58] world and as we've heard in these
[51:00] messages lately has been quickened
[51:03] by the light that's been shown forth in
[51:05] our age
[51:06] but now the question is
[51:08] through the tests and the trials have
[51:10] come to prove
[51:13] what that seed is capable of
[51:16] what that word is capable of
[51:18] because there's a time where it's gonna
[51:21] become it's a dividing time
[51:23] it's a time to divide the chat from the
[51:25] wheat
[51:28] that's the time we're at brothers and
[51:29] sisters
[51:31] there's a reason the great falling away
[51:33] has come
[51:34] the scripture says that that there don't
[51:37] be concerned when you see all these
[51:40] these different uh these many things
[51:42] that have come up in strange doctrines
[51:45] and things that have come he's he said
[51:46] these things have to
[51:48] come but they don't come just for the
[51:51] sake of them coming
[51:53] but they've come to prove
[51:55] what the acceptable is
[51:58] because you can't have a true without a
[52:00] false
[52:01] you can't have a positive without a
[52:04] negative
[52:05] there has to be we i remember our pastor
[52:08] preached it maybe a year ago there has
[52:10] to be a law
[52:13] of that distinction the contrast has to
[52:15] come
[52:16] so don't be concerned
[52:18] when you see all these tests and trials
[52:21] coming
[52:22] when you see
[52:23] a thousand will fall at your left hand
[52:25] ten thousand if that right but it shall
[52:27] not come nigh thee
[52:29] why because it's come to proof
[52:33] what is acceptable before the lord
[52:36] think it not strange count it all joy
[52:39] say how can i count it in joy
[52:42] and i'm not going to hold us along
[52:44] tonight i don't want to hold islam
[52:46] we're going to be very short by the
[52:47] grace of god but it's mainly because the
[52:49] idea is so simple but if the lord would
[52:52] quicken it to your hearts and to see
[52:55] how important this test is
[52:57] how important the trial is
[52:59] every day when you go through a
[53:01] temptation in a trial many times we we
[53:04] go through we see something see
[53:07] we see something that happens in our
[53:08] lives and we're going through something
[53:11] no matter what it is it could be an
[53:12] external trial
[53:14] we heard brother billy mention that a
[53:16] little bit oh we think about the bills
[53:17] and we think about this medical issue
[53:19] over here and we think about this family
[53:21] issue over here it could be an internal
[53:22] trial lord i've just struggled so much
[53:24] with this temptation i've just struggled
[53:27] so much with overcoming this thing in my
[53:29] life
[53:30] it could be external it could be
[53:31] internal it doesn't matter what it is
[53:34] but the trial has come for you
[53:37] you've got to understand that that satan
[53:40] is so whipped
[53:44] he is so whipped
[53:47] that he's nothing but just not just a
[53:49] temporary
[53:51] schoolmaster test for you
[53:54] say every temptation
[53:57] that comes in your life
[53:59] is for you
[54:01] it's not for the devil to exalt himself
[54:03] over the seed of god
[54:05] no sir why because he said the seed
[54:08] shall possess the gates of your enemies
[54:12] so the temptation didn't come see the
[54:14] devil has got many people tricked
[54:17] into thinking that the temptation has
[54:19] come to destroy you
[54:21] that the temptation has come to weed you
[54:24] out
[54:25] but remember if you're seed
[54:28] the temptation can only come to prove
[54:32] who you are
[54:39] it's come to prove you
[54:42] the lord told the children of israel he
[54:45] said i took you in the wilderness why
[54:48] to prove what
[54:50] what was in your hearts
[54:55] do you think god needed to prove it to
[54:56] himself what was in their hearts
[55:00] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[55:01] and intents of the heart
[55:03] he didn't have to know about that but
[55:05] what was he doing he was proving to them
[55:08] what was in their hearts
[55:11] when you go through these trials and
[55:13] temptations brothers and sisters
[55:15] they are for you
[55:17] to show
[55:18] you what we have left to work on if i
[55:21] could put it like that i'd like to keep
[55:23] it simple
[55:25] what do we have left that we haven't
[55:26] rooted out yet
[55:28] is there a root of bitterness over here
[55:31] is there a little bit of judgmental law
[55:33] law living over here little legalism
[55:36] here and there there's a lot of that
[55:38] going around
[55:40] but what happens the trial on the test
[55:42] has come to prove to you
[55:45] to show you what's in your heart
[55:48] it didn't come for the devil
[55:51] we think oh that the test is just here
[55:54] just so the devil can have his way with
[55:56] me no
[55:58] the devil's already whooped
[56:00] he's a defeated foe
[56:03] and i know they sound i just feel like
[56:05] to say this but i thought you know that
[56:07] this is the lord remember we're typed as
[56:09] eagles
[56:10] and i thought about this and i ended up
[56:12] finding a video on it i thought and not
[56:14] only that i thought it was really
[56:15] interesting you know that those parent
[56:17] eagles
[56:18] will bring living creatures into the
[56:20] nest
[56:21] to let the little eaglets
[56:23] practice how to kill that prey
[56:26] and you know when i looked that up you
[56:28] know what i found
[56:29] i found they brought a baby fox
[56:31] to the nest it's the little foxes that
[56:33] spoiled the vine
[56:34] and what did it do the mother brought a
[56:37] living baby fox
[56:39] it was no threat
[56:40] but what were they doing they were
[56:42] trying what is that eagle doing it's
[56:43] trying to instill in that child in that
[56:46] baby an instinct to understand what it's
[56:48] capable of
[56:51] it the that that parent is trying to
[56:53] teach them this is what i've given you
[56:56] this is what you this is your nature
[56:59] this is who you are
[57:01] this is the power that you have and when
[57:03] the when the lord brings love allows
[57:06] temptations into your life
[57:08] it's just to bring that devil see the
[57:10] devil's already whooped he's like that
[57:11] baby fox
[57:13] couldn't do nothing to those eagles if
[57:15] he tried
[57:16] but it's not there for the fox
[57:19] it's there for the eagle
[57:21] to show you that you have already
[57:24] overcome the world
[57:27] he's nothing but a defeated foe
[57:31] so what is he doing he's trying to teach
[57:32] us he's trying to build you up and you
[57:35] need to have faith in who you are
[57:38] we believed on who he is
[57:42] but do you have faith in who you are
[57:46] because if you had faith in who you are
[57:49] you truly understand who he is
[57:52] and if you truly understood who he is
[57:54] you'd understand who you are
[57:57] why because you start to realize there's
[57:59] no difference
[58:00] oh that sounds sacrilegious to say
[58:04] but if you've been able to catch the
[58:07] underlying
[58:08] thought that the lord has been trying to
[58:10] get through to his people in this church
[58:12] over the last month it's the shorts what
[58:14] does he bring that wave sheath what are
[58:16] we talking about the wave sheath what
[58:18] was the point of the wave sheath the
[58:20] point was not the wave sheath the point
[58:24] was to prove
[58:25] that that law worked
[58:28] and there was more behind it that were
[58:31] on the way
[58:32] just like the first one i don't know
[58:34] about you but i'm one of those ones
[58:37] that's on the way for the harvest right
[58:40] behind the wave sheath
[58:43] and that they're not going to be
[58:44] anything different
[58:48] why because remember the seed it's seed
[58:50] time again
[58:52] what's the difference between planting
[58:53] and harvest
[58:55] numbers
[58:57] one went into the ground 104 came up
[59:01] one wave sheath was waved a whole bride
[59:04] comes in behind it
[59:06] glory to god
[59:07] and it's not the man
[59:10] it's not about that
[59:12] we heard it this morning it always
[59:14] points to christ
[59:18] because he was the seed that went into
[59:19] the ground
[59:20] except the corn of wheat die
[59:22] it abideth alone
[59:24] but if it dies and goes into the grounds
[59:26] and rots
[59:28] through seven church ages it rotted
[59:30] through a dark ages it rotted
[59:33] and then it started to spring up
[59:34] it started to spring up luther came up
[59:37] wesley came up pentecostals came up then
[59:40] we had a wave sheath
[59:42] come along and what did it show it
[59:44] showed harvest time it's at the door
[59:47] harvest time is here
[59:49] not only is harvest time here
[59:51] but it's going to produce exactly what
[59:54] god's law said it would
[59:56] which is just like the beginning
[59:59] if i plated corn in the ground
[1:00:02] and i waited and that thing died and it
[1:00:04] rotted and started to come up
[1:00:06] and i came up with soybeans
[1:00:08] there's a problem somewhere
[1:00:12] if i planted corn and all of a sudden
[1:00:14] buckwheat came up there's a problem
[1:00:17] somewhere because what went into the
[1:00:19] ground is what has to come up
[1:00:26] so what are these trials to do these
[1:00:27] trials are to prove
[1:00:29] they're not to prove to god anything
[1:00:32] that's right god doesn't need to prove
[1:00:34] his word to himself
[1:00:35] he is his word
[1:00:37] he's trying to get you to believe it
[1:00:40] he's trying to get you on his page
[1:00:42] he's trying to get you to say that's me
[1:00:46] i can reach that
[1:00:48] i can be that
[1:00:50] i can live that
[1:00:52] i can walk and talk like that
[1:00:56] the same words that he did i will do
[1:01:00] why because he said it
[1:01:02] and if that word went down that word's
[1:01:04] got to come up
[1:01:08] the devil's got so many deceived into
[1:01:11] thinking they can't reach that bar
[1:01:15] when the reality of the situation is
[1:01:17] that's the only bar that's going to get
[1:01:19] you out of here
[1:01:22] and it's not the bar of william branham
[1:01:24] it's the bar of the lord jesus christ in
[1:01:26] william branham
[1:01:28] to show see god proved through that
[1:01:30] prophet's life
[1:01:32] that even in satan's eden
[1:01:34] in a fallen see god proved
[1:01:37] god proved in the old testament through
[1:01:38] the law
[1:01:40] that a fallen man
[1:01:42] couldn't do it
[1:01:44] prove through the law that a fallen man
[1:01:45] couldn't do it
[1:01:46] then he came
[1:01:48] in the in the in the body of jesus
[1:01:50] christ and proved that the word could do
[1:01:52] all of it
[1:01:54] then he's coming this day
[1:01:57] to prove that through that word
[1:02:00] a fallen man
[1:02:02] could rise up to a place where he can go
[1:02:05] back to an eating condition
[1:02:07] even in the body of his flesh
[1:02:12] that's why paul could say he said oh
[1:02:14] wretched man that i am
[1:02:15] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:02:17] this death he said but i thank god
[1:02:20] through the lord jesus christ it's a
[1:02:22] rhetorical question
[1:02:24] because it's already delivered
[1:02:28] if you could come to a place to accept
[1:02:30] who you are
[1:02:31] if you could truly grasp it and see what
[1:02:34] he's trying to tell you about who you
[1:02:36] are then you'll realize that all these
[1:02:38] tests and trials you're going through
[1:02:39] they're for you
[1:02:41] they were purpose built for you
[1:02:44] they were designed
[1:02:46] for you to overcome them because you got
[1:02:49] to be an overcomer
[1:02:52] you know the lord can't just lay it out
[1:02:53] on a plate and call it remember brother
[1:02:55] branham said that he said he just
[1:02:57] he pulls you over there and calling an
[1:02:58] overcomer no you didn't overcome
[1:02:59] anything
[1:03:00] but what are you overcoming you're over
[1:03:02] you don't even have to overcome the
[1:03:03] devil
[1:03:04] you've already done that
[1:03:06] why because he did it for you
[1:03:08] but now what do you have to do you have
[1:03:09] to overcome yourself
[1:03:12] you're overcoming yourself
[1:03:14] you're overcoming the body of this death
[1:03:15] every day
[1:03:17] when you look in that mirror and you see
[1:03:18] that old pesthouse staring back at you
[1:03:21] that old nasty thing that doesn't like
[1:03:23] the things of god that wants to be lazy
[1:03:26] that doesn't want to love their brother
[1:03:28] but then there's a like what do we hear
[1:03:29] this morning but there's a revival in
[1:03:31] your heart
[1:03:32] that's burning and saying god i see the
[1:03:35] life
[1:03:37] that you have for me
[1:03:39] i see the word that i have designed and
[1:03:42] made and called to live
[1:03:47] it'll bring forth it'll it'll it will
[1:03:50] overcome this flesh so much
[1:03:53] that they'll think you're jesus christ
[1:03:54] himself
[1:03:56] you know why i can say that because they
[1:03:57] thought that about brother branham
[1:03:59] and i don't know about you but that's
[1:04:00] the same life we're called to
[1:04:02] oh you say brother that can't be it
[1:04:03] that's the only place it can be
[1:04:06] you know what you know you know what the
[1:04:08] scripture says in first john
[1:04:09] he says he says brethren try the spirits
[1:04:13] he says any spirit
[1:04:15] that says jesus that does not say jesus
[1:04:17] christ is come in the flesh is not of
[1:04:18] god
[1:04:19] that's a present tense
[1:04:21] jesus christ is coming the flesh now he
[1:04:23] did and william branham jesus christ is
[1:04:27] come in this flesh
[1:04:29] in your flesh in his flesh in her flesh
[1:04:32] jesus christ see that's why i appreciate
[1:04:34] the way brother the lord had brother
[1:04:36] billy bring it out this morning he said
[1:04:37] any spirit that tells you that you
[1:04:39] cannot attain
[1:04:41] that's of the devil
[1:04:43] it doesn't matter what the excuses are
[1:04:45] you can have all the excuses you want
[1:04:48] but the word already said so
[1:04:50] that christ is come in the flesh
[1:04:54] he says if you abide in me and my word
[1:04:56] and you ask what you will
[1:04:58] he says he says my father and i will
[1:04:59] come and we all make our abode with him
[1:05:01] i would that they be one even as we are
[1:05:03] one so if jesus was so much one
[1:05:07] when you see me you see the father and
[1:05:09] he said i would they be the same
[1:05:12] then who might argue
[1:05:14] i want that
[1:05:15] i need that
[1:05:16] i'm going to have it not because i can
[1:05:19] work myself to it but because i'm going
[1:05:22] to yield myself to the word until he
[1:05:24] brings it to pass
[1:05:27] we've got it mistaken when we think
[1:05:29] we're sitting there struggling and
[1:05:30] fighting you know the only thing you're
[1:05:32] struggling and fighting with is not
[1:05:33] being honest with yourself
[1:05:36] because you go through temptations you
[1:05:38] go through trials
[1:05:41] those are good you know why
[1:05:43] because there's a lot of revealing that
[1:05:44] goes on when you start getting into
[1:05:46] trials
[1:05:47] you start to reveal a lot of things see
[1:05:50] james says
[1:05:51] in james
[1:05:54] a little bit farther down here i believe
[1:05:56] yeah james chapter 1
[1:05:58] he says
[1:05:59] he says let no man say when he is
[1:06:00] tempted i am tempted of god
[1:06:02] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:06:04] neither attempteth he any man
[1:06:06] but every man is tempted
[1:06:08] when he is drawn away of satan's own
[1:06:10] lust that's not what he says
[1:06:12] he says when he has drawn away of his
[1:06:14] own lust
[1:06:15] seeing too many
[1:06:16] times i i know brother branham said this
[1:06:19] you can look it up and he said it many
[1:06:20] times he said too many people say oh the
[1:06:22] devil made me do it he said the devil
[1:06:23] didn't make you do it
[1:06:25] he said you heard his call and you went
[1:06:27] out to him
[1:06:29] because he can't come into you
[1:06:31] he'd be your brother
[1:06:33] so what was it it's just like the
[1:06:34] remember the story of the little sister
[1:06:36] that had just gotten saved and she's
[1:06:39] just walking down the street and she
[1:06:41] walks past the music hall
[1:06:43] and when she stopped just for a second
[1:06:46] let no man say i'm tempted of god
[1:06:48] but what was it she was drawn away
[1:06:51] brother bram said right there she
[1:06:52] stopped that's where she lost it first
[1:06:54] of all
[1:06:55] because she she even gave the devil an
[1:06:57] ear
[1:06:59] brother branham said resisting the devil
[1:07:01] is really simple you just ignore him and
[1:07:02] move on
[1:07:04] but what happens we're not honest with
[1:07:06] ourselves brothers and sisters we've got
[1:07:08] to come what what are we here a revival
[1:07:10] is getting the trash out
[1:07:12] getting all the trash out
[1:07:14] admitting that there's trash there to
[1:07:16] begin with well we're the bride we don't
[1:07:18] have nothing wrong we don't have this or
[1:07:20] that then why are we not seeing a
[1:07:22] perfect overcoming power
[1:07:24] this isn't about being accusations or
[1:07:26] anything we've already overcome
[1:07:29] but the question is have we really
[1:07:31] trusted him the way we claim to
[1:07:35] because there's never a fault with god
[1:07:38] never a fault with god
[1:07:39] but what did she do she listed and then
[1:07:42] what did she she was drawn away of her
[1:07:43] own lust
[1:07:45] see no matter what you do
[1:07:48] this flesh has its things going on
[1:07:51] you know not everybody struggles with
[1:07:53] everything
[1:07:55] by the grace of god i never you know
[1:07:56] there are certain things i never
[1:07:57] struggled with there are certain things
[1:07:59] you may never struggle with so that
[1:08:01] maybe isn't inherent in your struggle
[1:08:04] but but see it's time we got away from
[1:08:06] all the devil did this and the devil did
[1:08:08] this no he says you're drawn away of
[1:08:10] your own lust
[1:08:12] so maybe it's time we own our own
[1:08:16] see but that's but that's why you can
[1:08:18] rejoice in the trial
[1:08:20] when the tempt he said rejoice in the
[1:08:22] temptations
[1:08:24] why because when you start to feel that
[1:08:26] pull of a temptation do you know what
[1:08:28] god's doing in that he's revealing to
[1:08:30] you
[1:08:32] where the problem might be
[1:08:34] he's revealing to you where the enemy's
[1:08:36] laying
[1:08:40] see we did oh he's just doing this to do
[1:08:41] it no god is giving you opportunity
[1:08:45] you say oh lord
[1:08:47] i don't want to have that pull in my
[1:08:48] heart to listen to that music
[1:08:50] or that sister how she thought about all
[1:08:52] the time she danced and what are the
[1:08:54] awards and oh i did this and did that
[1:08:56] what was it there was a little bit of a
[1:08:58] pool
[1:08:59] but the temptation came and what was it
[1:09:01] the temptation actually reveals the
[1:09:04] devil think i thought the way the lord
[1:09:07] gave it to me was this we're in a battle
[1:09:10] and the devil lies around every corner
[1:09:12] waiting to ambush you you don't
[1:09:14] necessarily know where he is all the
[1:09:16] time there are sometimes it's pretty
[1:09:18] obvious where the trap's at hey you want
[1:09:20] to go to this party after school today
[1:09:23] i got a bunch of beer we're coming that
[1:09:25] trap's pretty obvious or at least it
[1:09:27] should be
[1:09:30] but you don't always know where the
[1:09:31] devil's going to anoint someone just to
[1:09:33] try to press those buttons
[1:09:36] it could be a brother or a sister it
[1:09:38] could be a co-worker it could be a
[1:09:39] family member
[1:09:41] you don't always know where the trap's
[1:09:42] going to be set but what happens is when
[1:09:45] the trap is sprung
[1:09:48] any military person will tell you if
[1:09:49] that once they spring the trap
[1:09:51] the jig is up you know where the enemy's
[1:09:53] at
[1:09:54] so when the temptation comes
[1:09:56] the devil of a necessity must reveal
[1:09:59] himself
[1:10:02] praise the lord for the temptation
[1:10:04] praise the lord when it comes because
[1:10:06] then i can focus my fire
[1:10:08] i can say there he is right there
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:13] and then what he do you get that on your
[1:10:14] knees and you pray you cover it over in
[1:10:17] prayer you get before the lord and say
[1:10:19] lord i don't wanna i don't wanna have
[1:10:21] this anymore i wanna repent i wanna i
[1:10:24] wanna true repentance
[1:10:26] that's what we like a lot of times it's
[1:10:28] true repentance
[1:10:29] honesty with ourselves saying lord
[1:10:31] there's a oh well
[1:10:33] lord the devil did this and the death no
[1:10:35] there's lord there's something in me i
[1:10:38] need you to take out
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:41] say lord try my heart and see if
[1:10:43] there'll be any wicked way in me and
[1:10:45] take every bit of it out
[1:10:48] every one of these trials and
[1:10:50] temptations comes with a purpose it
[1:10:52] comes to help you these trials are not
[1:10:54] to destroy you
[1:10:55] god is for you not against you
[1:11:02] joe if anybody had a right to think god
[1:11:03] was against him it was job
[1:11:05] he said lord
[1:11:07] i i did the right things i sacrificed
[1:11:09] correctly i prayed for my children i i
[1:11:12] helped the widows and the orphans and
[1:11:14] the all these ones i had to love and all
[1:11:16] these things and people keep accusing me
[1:11:19] but you see the trial was for job
[1:11:22] the trial was for job let's see if i
[1:11:24] could find this quote you forgive me my
[1:11:25] printer stopped working at home
[1:11:27] so i had to i don't like necessarily
[1:11:29] bringing my phone up here but
[1:11:30] i have there's a
[1:11:33] you know job
[1:11:35] there was something that job had
[1:11:38] where and i don't know if i can find
[1:11:40] this right now but
[1:11:42] lord knows
[1:11:46] but you can find it in the message
[1:11:47] perfect faith in 1963. brother branham
[1:11:50] said that job fear
[1:11:53] and because he feared
[1:11:55] the things that he feared came upon him
[1:11:57] now job the scripture says he was
[1:11:59] perfect and upright in his ways
[1:12:01] but yet there was something that god
[1:12:03] needed to reveal to job
[1:12:05] brother braham said in another place i
[1:12:06] can't remember the message he said job
[1:12:08] fear death
[1:12:10] why he had the he asked the question he
[1:12:12] said lord i see the tree go down and
[1:12:14] come up
[1:12:15] i don't understand it but a man goes
[1:12:16] down doesn't come back up
[1:12:18] so what was it see
[1:12:20] god used that trial
[1:12:23] not only to reveal job's problem
[1:12:25] he had feared brother braham says in
[1:12:27] that message perfect faith they said if
[1:12:29] he had faith he said it wouldn't have
[1:12:31] happened
[1:12:32] but because he feared it brought it to
[1:12:35] pass
[1:12:36] he said the thing that which i feared
[1:12:38] came upon me
[1:12:40] praise the lord he had enough revelation
[1:12:42] to see what it was
[1:12:43] but what happened see this is the grace
[1:12:46] of the trial
[1:12:47] even in the midst of the trial because
[1:12:49] even in the middle he said lord i have
[1:12:51] these questions i don't understand death
[1:12:53] doesn't make any sense
[1:12:55] and then here comes god in the midst of
[1:12:57] the trial see the trial not only reveals
[1:12:59] the devil and his tricks
[1:13:01] but then god through the trial reveals a
[1:13:04] portion of his nature to you
[1:13:08] because it's in that trial
[1:13:10] that god will reveal that his portion of
[1:13:12] himself that can lift you out of it
[1:13:18] i think brother billy said it this
[1:13:19] morning he said so many times those
[1:13:20] little portions they'll sit there and
[1:13:22] lay dormant
[1:13:23] for years
[1:13:25] but it's already in you you just didn't
[1:13:26] even know it yet because it wasn't the
[1:13:28] season to come forth
[1:13:30] but then god brings you into a trial
[1:13:33] just so he can get you to a place
[1:13:35] to prove to you what he already placed
[1:13:38] in you
[1:13:40] so it wasn't to destroy job it was to
[1:13:43] show him and what he said he said i know
[1:13:45] my redeemer liveth
[1:13:47] he had all these questions the pro
[1:13:49] brother branham said he feared death at
[1:13:50] one time but then in the midst of that
[1:13:52] trial in the midst of the temptation
[1:13:56] then the lord comes in and raises up a
[1:13:58] standard gives the prophet a vision he
[1:14:01] says though the skin worms destroy my
[1:14:03] body
[1:14:04] yet in my flesh i'll see god
[1:14:06] my eyes will behold him and not another
[1:14:09] he said i'll stand before him in the
[1:14:10] last days so what was it he was
[1:14:12] revealing himself in the midst of the
[1:14:14] trial
[1:14:16] and then he comes along later
[1:14:19] and job had all these fears about oh
[1:14:22] well i feared this might come upon me
[1:14:23] and this might come upon me and god
[1:14:25] threw it all shows don't worry about it
[1:14:26] job where were you when i
[1:14:29] when the sons of god sing together
[1:14:32] and i believe job had a revelation he
[1:14:33] said i was there
[1:14:35] i was in you
[1:14:36] i believe that
[1:14:38] why because in the midst of the trial is
[1:14:41] where god reveals himself to be who he
[1:14:43] is
[1:14:44] it's in the middle of the battle
[1:14:46] where god see it's easy
[1:14:48] to just take things for granted when
[1:14:50] you're on the mountaintop and he got
[1:14:52] everything going for you
[1:14:53] but when you get in the middle of the
[1:14:55] battle and things start to get really
[1:14:58] down and dirty
[1:14:59] and on every hand it seems like things
[1:15:01] are going wrong
[1:15:04] that's where god reveals himself to you
[1:15:07] if you would just submit yourself to him
[1:15:09] but the trial has come for your benefit
[1:15:11] the trial did not come to destroy you
[1:15:14] the trial did not come to push you
[1:15:16] farther away
[1:15:18] but it came to draw you closer
[1:15:22] the trial came to prove to you who you
[1:15:24] are
[1:15:26] i was i i was seeing a thing and they
[1:15:28] were talking about carburetors
[1:15:30] and this factory that made carburetors
[1:15:32] and they make them all and they're
[1:15:33] pretty complicated little machines
[1:15:35] and
[1:15:37] if you don't remember those are the
[1:15:38] things that used to go in cars way back
[1:15:39] in the day now it's all fuel injected i
[1:15:41] think and all these different things but
[1:15:43] they make these carburetors and they put
[1:15:44] them together but before they can
[1:15:46] package them in a box and ship them off
[1:15:48] they have to hook them up to a machine
[1:15:50] and test them
[1:15:52] and they test every pressure point
[1:15:54] they test every little crevice and crack
[1:15:56] and seal
[1:15:58] and that's what god is doing to you
[1:15:59] right now in the trial
[1:16:01] so don't
[1:16:02] don't worry
[1:16:04] say oh lord
[1:16:05] i i failed in this trial say praise god
[1:16:08] you revealed to me where i need help
[1:16:11] lord you you revealed to me where the
[1:16:13] enemy lies
[1:16:14] see we get so we throw up our hands and
[1:16:16] just say oh lord i can't do it well you
[1:16:18] can't that's the point it's always been
[1:16:21] the point
[1:16:22] but he's bringing us up to a place
[1:16:23] brothers and sisters he's bringing us to
[1:16:26] a place
[1:16:27] where
[1:16:28] as he is
[1:16:30] so are we
[1:16:33] i believe the book of john
[1:16:35] if i can find it here
[1:16:38] bear with me if i can find the scripture
[1:16:39] here
[1:16:47] amen and first john chapter four
[1:16:53] now
[1:16:54] and we'll close here in just a minute i
[1:16:56] know we'll be really short but that's i
[1:16:57] just feel led to just not really go very
[1:16:59] long
[1:17:00] maybe we'll read a quote or some or
[1:17:02] something here
[1:17:07] but he says in first john chapter 4
[1:17:10] he says herein
[1:17:12] now let's start at verse
[1:17:14] 16. and we have known and believed the
[1:17:18] love that god hath to us
[1:17:20] god is love
[1:17:22] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:17:25] god
[1:17:26] and god in him
[1:17:28] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:17:30] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:17:32] because as he is
[1:17:35] so are we in this world
[1:17:38] that's where that's where we're at
[1:17:39] brothers and sisters
[1:17:40] as he is
[1:17:42] so are we in this world that jesus
[1:17:44] christ has come in the flesh
[1:17:47] he's bringing us to that place
[1:17:49] but these trials and temptations you're
[1:17:51] going through he's trying to prove to
[1:17:52] you he wants you to have confidence
[1:17:55] in who you are
[1:17:57] brother branham in that message perfect
[1:17:59] faith said jesus had confidence in who
[1:18:02] he was
[1:18:04] he had faith in what the word said about
[1:18:07] him
[1:18:08] which is why he could do the things that
[1:18:10] he did
[1:18:11] simply because he believed what the word
[1:18:14] spoke about him
[1:18:15] and that's what the lord is trying to
[1:18:16] get us to do
[1:18:18] is to believe
[1:18:20] what the word spoken about us in this
[1:18:22] day
[1:18:23] that there is a bride
[1:18:25] that has a that has a message to preach
[1:18:28] not a different message
[1:18:31] it's not something different why because
[1:18:33] it's got to go back to eden
[1:18:35] and it's got to go back to the very
[1:18:37] first message
[1:18:38] and what was the trick that the devil
[1:18:40] got pulled over on eve in the beginning
[1:18:43] that the original message wasn't enough
[1:18:46] that there was something extra that
[1:18:48] could be gained somewhere
[1:18:50] why do you think there are so many
[1:18:51] schisms and doctrines and paths and
[1:18:54] things that run down because they've
[1:18:56] taken this message and they rejoiced but
[1:18:59] because it was carnal
[1:19:01] they started they started to get
[1:19:03] distressed they started to get if i
[1:19:05] could say antsy as we say they started
[1:19:07] to get a little bit there's got to be
[1:19:09] something more there's got to be
[1:19:10] something more there's got to be
[1:19:11] something more no there is no there is
[1:19:14] no other there was no other message in
[1:19:16] the garden of either eden other than the
[1:19:18] day you eat thereof that day you'll die
[1:19:21] but see what did satan come along and
[1:19:23] said surely
[1:19:24] there's a little bit more to be gained
[1:19:26] over here
[1:19:28] remember she was drawn away brother
[1:19:30] branham said i believe in the message
[1:19:32] god of this evil age that she was
[1:19:35] she was drawn away why she by her by
[1:19:37] lust brother ram said what was it a lust
[1:19:39] for knowledge
[1:19:41] she wanted to know
[1:19:43] and i believe we mentioned this in the
[1:19:44] last service but the problem was
[1:19:47] and what the devil's trying to get over
[1:19:48] the people of god in this hour
[1:19:50] is that you already have all the
[1:19:52] knowledge that you need
[1:19:55] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:57] and forever
[1:19:59] it's the word and nothing else
[1:20:01] see there's no other message to come and
[1:20:04] the devil's going to try to be out there
[1:20:05] remember with false prophets
[1:20:08] he said they even work now in the world
[1:20:10] and they've been working ever since
[1:20:12] right at the beginning when paul
[1:20:13] preached
[1:20:14] that spirit of antichrist trying to get
[1:20:16] people to believe there's a little
[1:20:17] something extra here
[1:20:19] if you could just dig a little deeper
[1:20:21] there's a little bit more than what
[1:20:22] anybody else has got
[1:20:24] brothers and sisters don't be deceived
[1:20:26] that way
[1:20:27] why because the the test is gonna prove
[1:20:30] and it's proving that went out from
[1:20:32] among us because they weren't of us
[1:20:34] see what was it we've seen all the ones
[1:20:35] that have departed recently
[1:20:37] what do they all have in common well
[1:20:39] there had to be something else to it
[1:20:41] there had to be something more so what
[1:20:43] did we do we started digging deeper we
[1:20:44] started digging deeper carnally now
[1:20:47] they started digging and digging and
[1:20:48] digging and digging and what did it get
[1:20:50] but he said they wrestled to their own
[1:20:52] destruction
[1:20:55] and we've seen a shipwreck it's exactly
[1:20:57] what paul called he said they'd be a
[1:20:58] shipwreck
[1:20:59] and that's all we see now is shipwrecks
[1:21:01] on the left shipwrecks on the right why
[1:21:04] because they've people we've wandered
[1:21:06] from the simplicity
[1:21:08] the atonement
[1:21:11] of calvary
[1:21:12] was enough
[1:21:15] what the seven seals
[1:21:17] and the seven thunders and the seven
[1:21:19] church ages did
[1:21:20] was reveal to us
[1:21:22] what that atonement actually did
[1:21:26] see the problem is oh there's got to be
[1:21:28] more to it no we had no idea what it was
[1:21:31] until those seals were broken
[1:21:34] we had no concept
[1:21:36] that god was calling us to that place
[1:21:39] to set in my throne
[1:21:41] and to truly have a revelation of what
[1:21:44] that means do you know
[1:21:46] what god has called you to
[1:21:49] god has called you to be a partaker of
[1:21:52] deity
[1:21:56] remember gold is deity
[1:21:58] he said your faith your triumph your
[1:22:00] faith is more precious than gold
[1:22:03] he said you'll be like gold tried in the
[1:22:05] fire
[1:22:08] the problem is maybe we haven't quite
[1:22:11] been able to come to a full revelation
[1:22:13] of that
[1:22:15] and and you forgive me i don't have the
[1:22:16] quote here and i want to look it up and
[1:22:18] bring it because it's such a powerful
[1:22:19] thing
[1:22:20] but in the church age book brother
[1:22:22] branham mentions one little quote in
[1:22:24] there that just really always struck me
[1:22:25] he said he said
[1:22:27] many that are gonna miss it
[1:22:29] are gonna miss it because they didn't
[1:22:31] fully accept the atonement
[1:22:34] it's that simple because if you could
[1:22:36] truly accept it's accepting
[1:22:40] you've got to receive it
[1:22:44] see when when the angel when the mighty
[1:22:46] angel came down
[1:22:47] with an open book in hand
[1:22:50] he didn't go to john the type of the
[1:22:51] bride and cram it down his mouth
[1:22:54] he said you take it
[1:22:56] you eat it
[1:22:57] that's we've got to take this word
[1:23:00] we've got to eat this word we've got to
[1:23:03] be completely saturated
[1:23:05] with this word because faith only comes
[1:23:08] by hearing the word
[1:23:10] that's all and there's no word outside
[1:23:12] of this message
[1:23:14] the rest of it is is going down
[1:23:17] because not one jot or tittle will pass
[1:23:19] away and they've all perverted outside
[1:23:22] of this message
[1:23:24] there is no rapture outside the message
[1:23:27] of william branham
[1:23:29] it can't happen
[1:23:30] because christ is the word he won't have
[1:23:34] one arm god he won't have one here and
[1:23:36] one there
[1:23:38] when it comes to the word it's all the
[1:23:40] word or nothing
[1:23:42] so it's got to come back to an eden
[1:23:44] showdown again
[1:23:46] are you going to take what the word says
[1:23:49] yes sir or are you going to try to
[1:23:51] figure it out some way that there's got
[1:23:53] to be something extra to it
[1:23:56] could you think i
[1:23:57] i marvel and i appreciate a prophet
[1:24:01] and the way he was open with us about
[1:24:03] all the things that he struggled
[1:24:05] why because we start to see even through
[1:24:06] his life being a type for us
[1:24:09] to show us that all the trials that god
[1:24:11] allowed him to go through served a
[1:24:12] purpose
[1:24:14] when he disobeyed god
[1:24:17] when it came to the pentecostals and had
[1:24:19] to lose his wife and his daughter
[1:24:22] god wasn't trying to destroy him
[1:24:24] even though it looked like it and satan
[1:24:26] tried to tell him that right come right
[1:24:27] over his shoulder and you and you said
[1:24:29] god loves you
[1:24:30] and look what he's done your wife
[1:24:32] already died and your little innocent
[1:24:34] baby laying dying right there but that
[1:24:36] wasn't the point
[1:24:37] the point was to mold him
[1:24:40] and to make him what if
[1:24:42] what i mean if anyone would see their
[1:24:44] faults in that moment and to see the
[1:24:46] mistake that he made by rejecting the
[1:24:49] path that god had laid out
[1:24:51] in that moment it was william branham
[1:24:53] but what was it that was the purpose
[1:24:55] because there was a work down the road
[1:24:57] that he had as the prophecy would say he
[1:25:00] had to take the harder path
[1:25:02] he had to take the harder way
[1:25:04] he had to take the weight like god said
[1:25:06] it is my way
[1:25:08] and that's what god is looking for us
[1:25:11] he's not looking for us to just coast
[1:25:13] down through the trial's got to come
[1:25:16] and we've got to consciously take the
[1:25:18] road with god's despised view
[1:25:21] because it won't be a flowery bed of
[1:25:23] ease it's not going to just be coasting
[1:25:25] on the resume of william branham
[1:25:31] we've come underneath that umbrella but
[1:25:33] have we come into the life of it
[1:25:38] all the mistakes that he made
[1:25:41] knowing
[1:25:43] abby i believe he had a full revelation
[1:25:45] of who he was and what commission he was
[1:25:47] fulfilling
[1:25:48] you could see it in the way he spoke
[1:25:51] but could you imagine
[1:25:53] now mentally
[1:25:55] and and the the temptations and the
[1:25:57] pressures
[1:25:58] that would have to come with that
[1:26:01] and then to see
[1:26:02] a man
[1:26:03] that could lie to somebody and tell his
[1:26:06] wife i'm not telling i'm not here
[1:26:08] a man that could look back on his
[1:26:10] failures and how he failed god
[1:26:13] but he what was it he had such a simple
[1:26:16] faith
[1:26:17] that the atonement of jesus christ
[1:26:20] was
[1:26:21] sufficient
[1:26:22] to bring him into such a perfect
[1:26:24] fellowship
[1:26:25] that he could walk with no condemnation
[1:26:28] before the people with that kind of a
[1:26:30] commission weighing down on him
[1:26:32] but because why he could understand it
[1:26:34] wasn't about him in the first place but
[1:26:36] it was about the world
[1:26:39] god fulfills his word not even just for
[1:26:42] your sake
[1:26:43] but for his word's sake
[1:26:45] and because you are the word
[1:26:48] he's got jesus obligated to fulfill it
[1:26:50] to you
[1:26:51] because he can't let if you're part of
[1:26:53] the word if you are the word how many
[1:26:55] believe you're the word
[1:26:57] you've been broken off an attribute of
[1:26:59] god
[1:27:01] and an attribute of god is nothing else
[1:27:03] in the word
[1:27:04] and if god won't let one word of his
[1:27:07] fall to the ground
[1:27:08] without fulfilling itself
[1:27:10] then how can you fail
[1:27:14] you can't
[1:27:15] because you are the word
[1:27:17] if you're the word
[1:27:19] you cannot fail
[1:27:21] any more than god could fail
[1:27:24] because he won't let you fall to the
[1:27:25] ground
[1:27:26] without fulfilling your purpose
[1:27:29] how so how how could you that's why
[1:27:31] jesus could go into the grave
[1:27:34] he said i know i'll suffer not my holy
[1:27:35] one to see corruption
[1:27:37] i won't leave his soul in heroes in hell
[1:27:40] or suffer his body to see corruption why
[1:27:42] because he knew that word pertained to
[1:27:44] him
[1:27:45] so if god has spoken a word to you in
[1:27:47] this hour
[1:27:49] and it can only be that's why it's not
[1:27:51] it's not a conglomerate it's not a it's
[1:27:53] not a guilt by association well i'm just
[1:27:56] attached to the message and so i just
[1:27:58] partake of that blessing
[1:28:00] well you may receive some fringe
[1:28:01] benefits
[1:28:04] just like many of the hangars on did you
[1:28:06] may get a little fish and loaves
[1:28:08] you may get a little snack here and
[1:28:10] there
[1:28:11] but when it comes to the the rubber
[1:28:13] meets the road unless you eat the flesh
[1:28:15] of the cinnamon and drink his blood
[1:28:17] it's going to push you away one of those
[1:28:18] days
[1:28:19] except you have that word in you at
[1:28:21] which point that trial didn't come
[1:28:24] to cast you away it came to draw you
[1:28:26] closer where else shall we go
[1:28:30] am i making sense
[1:28:32] he's calling us to a higher place
[1:28:35] we've got a higher calling
[1:28:38] than just sitting on a church pew
[1:28:40] and just saying oh well lord i hope this
[1:28:42] happened no you were called a word of
[1:28:45] god for this hour
[1:28:48] that's why no one can fulfill your place
[1:28:50] because nothing can add or take away
[1:28:53] and if you can't add or take away from
[1:28:55] the word
[1:28:57] then i can't add or take away from that
[1:28:58] body
[1:29:00] because only you can fulfill that
[1:29:01] portion if i were to take away my part
[1:29:04] would be taken away
[1:29:06] because you're part of him
[1:29:08] your bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:29:10] word of his word power of his power life
[1:29:12] of his life
[1:29:14] he can't deny you
[1:29:18] and these trials and temptations
[1:29:21] haven't come to prove it to him they've
[1:29:23] come to prove it to you
[1:29:26] why because he knows what we are
[1:29:28] he knew from the foundation of the world
[1:29:30] what we were
[1:29:31] we act as if god is surprised
[1:29:35] we act as if god didn't see what was
[1:29:37] coming down the road
[1:29:38] he already knew what was there
[1:29:41] he provided an avenue he said with every
[1:29:43] temptation there's a way of escape
[1:29:47] but what do we do sometimes we just get
[1:29:48] drawn away by our lusts
[1:29:50] and then we try to pass the buck off to
[1:29:51] say well that was their thing they did
[1:29:53] this no
[1:29:54] you did it
[1:29:55] put it before the lord put it under the
[1:29:57] blood and move on
[1:29:59] leave the past in the past
[1:30:01] move on from there say lord try me one
[1:30:03] more time
[1:30:06] so i'd say that as we're getting ready
[1:30:08] for communion this evening and we'll
[1:30:09] just all stand and we'll close with that
[1:30:12] with this
[1:30:16] i didn't want to keep us long
[1:30:18] and i don't know if the lord would allow
[1:30:19] me to find
[1:30:42] well so that's all right we'll just
[1:30:44] we'll just leave it there
[1:30:48] god has made you an overcomer
[1:30:52] he's made you that way
[1:30:56] but sometimes he's got to prove it to
[1:30:57] you that you're an overcomer
[1:31:02] but he go you you go through the test
[1:31:06] so you could have confidence in what he
[1:31:08] made you
[1:31:11] so don't think it's strange remember the
[1:31:12] trial of your faith is more precious
[1:31:14] than gold
[1:31:16] why because every time you go through
[1:31:18] these trials whether you saw a test is a
[1:31:20] test you take a test in school
[1:31:23] how many ever taken a test and failed
[1:31:26] what did that just prove to you
[1:31:28] well didn't prove you weren't going to
[1:31:29] graduate
[1:31:32] but it proved
[1:31:33] in that carnal case maybe you need to do
[1:31:35] a little more studying
[1:31:36] maybe there's something you need to do a
[1:31:37] little catching up on
[1:31:39] so when you come to a trial
[1:31:41] success or
[1:31:42] failure remember god is using it to
[1:31:46] reveal something to you
[1:31:48] the trials
[1:31:49] when they put that little carburetor in
[1:31:51] the machine to test it
[1:31:53] what is it it's to reveal any little
[1:31:55] flaw
[1:31:56] any little thing that's not like it
[1:31:58] when it's put when that when that
[1:32:00] refiner puts the gold into the fire
[1:32:02] it's not to destroy the gold
[1:32:05] it's to get it to a place where that
[1:32:07] refiner can get all the dross out
[1:32:10] the refiner can start to hammer i was ju
[1:32:13] we were joking with the brother it said
[1:32:14] it's amazing when you think about
[1:32:16] forging
[1:32:17] when they take medals and they want to
[1:32:19] form them into something and that's what
[1:32:20] god's doing to you he's forging you he's
[1:32:22] making you he's molding you into his
[1:32:24] image
[1:32:26] but it's a painful process for the metal
[1:32:29] because the metal first has to go into
[1:32:30] the furnace
[1:32:32] and then it gets heated up to where it's
[1:32:34] glowing the fiery trials of temptation
[1:32:38] and then what happens
[1:32:39] then that ingot is pulled out of the
[1:32:42] fire and no doubt the income says oh
[1:32:43] praise the lord i'm out of the trial
[1:32:46] and as soon as the end gets out of the
[1:32:47] fire puts it on the anvil and starts
[1:32:49] hammered away because now he's going
[1:32:52] through the trial he's soft enough to be
[1:32:54] molded
[1:32:57] and then he says oh praise the lord
[1:33:00] now i'm done with the hammering
[1:33:02] now he's got to go to the quenching
[1:33:03] station
[1:33:05] now that's the last part but many times
[1:33:09] he hammers it
[1:33:10] and he can only get so much out of that
[1:33:12] trial
[1:33:13] because you know you go how many you
[1:33:14] know this brothers and sisters you go
[1:33:16] through a trial god gets you desperate
[1:33:19] you say you get down on your own lord
[1:33:20] help oh lord i need you
[1:33:24] lord help me i'll rep i repent
[1:33:27] i'm just being honest
[1:33:31] and then he brings you out of the trial
[1:33:32] and he's molding you he hammers you you
[1:33:34] go through some pain you say lord but
[1:33:36] then what happens what happens you start
[1:33:37] to cool off
[1:33:39] what happens when that metal starts to
[1:33:40] cool off it starts to get hard again
[1:33:43] so what does he have to do stick your
[1:33:44] right back in the fire
[1:33:48] and then what do they do they take those
[1:33:49] bellows
[1:33:50] the big old
[1:33:51] glow that looks like an accordion and
[1:33:54] that he just hits that bellows what is
[1:33:55] he doing he's making it hotter yeah he's
[1:33:57] blowing he's blowing it a little hotter
[1:34:00] a little hotter then he'd say oh lord i
[1:34:02] can't take the fire he says okay and
[1:34:03] starts hammering me again
[1:34:06] but that's what is it the trial
[1:34:08] the trial is not to destroy
[1:34:11] that material
[1:34:13] but it's it's the master knows
[1:34:16] the purpose for that material
[1:34:18] he knows the purpose for your life
[1:34:21] every though every time he sticks you in
[1:34:23] those fiery trials you know what you can
[1:34:25] rejoice why because he's softening you
[1:34:27] up
[1:34:28] he's getting you moldable
[1:34:30] to his will because what happens what
[1:34:33] did we hear this morning how we need
[1:34:34] those revival fires to burn
[1:34:37] we need those revival fires in our heart
[1:34:39] to burn more and more why because that's
[1:34:41] what keeps us soft
[1:34:43] that's what keeps us moldable but if we
[1:34:46] let that cool breeze of laodicea start
[1:34:48] to blow over you what happens you start
[1:34:50] to cool down and once that metal starts
[1:34:52] to cool it gets hard
[1:34:53] you say lord the word doesn't move me
[1:34:55] the way it used to
[1:34:57] maybe you need a little bit of a trial
[1:35:00] maybe you need some fiery trials
[1:35:02] to come and warm me up a little bit
[1:35:05] you know it's it's when the you know
[1:35:07] it's wind it's not the you're not gonna
[1:35:09] you're not gonna cozy up to the fire
[1:35:11] when it's hot outside
[1:35:12] it's when it gets that cold dark night
[1:35:15] that you start to cozy up to the fire
[1:35:18] many ma many of us maybe got a little
[1:35:20] too comfortable
[1:35:22] we've we've gotten really cozy in the in
[1:35:24] the world and the way things are and
[1:35:26] it's really comfortable well sometimes
[1:35:28] those trials come along to get you out
[1:35:30] of that comfort zone get you into that
[1:35:32] cold winter so you'll cozy up to the
[1:35:35] fire a little more
[1:35:36] but praise the lord you know what
[1:35:37] happens then when that when that
[1:35:39] blacksmith is done
[1:35:40] and he gets that final forging
[1:35:43] you know i always used to think you know
[1:35:44] they talk about the quenching of the
[1:35:46] metal
[1:35:47] and i always used to thought they'd do
[1:35:48] it in water but no they actually do it
[1:35:50] in oil
[1:35:51] praise the lord for the oil
[1:35:54] he takes that he takes that thing it's
[1:35:55] still hot
[1:35:57] but what happens is he takes it and
[1:35:58] quenches it in that oil and they say
[1:36:00] molecularly the structure of it
[1:36:03] if you quench it just right see if you
[1:36:05] quench it if you quench it at the wrong
[1:36:07] time
[1:36:08] that that sword or whatever you're
[1:36:10] making will become brittle
[1:36:12] and then when you go to use it it'll
[1:36:13] just break
[1:36:15] or if you don't but if you don't quench
[1:36:17] it
[1:36:18] it'll just be soft and you could just
[1:36:19] bend it it wouldn't do it it'll never
[1:36:21] hold an edge
[1:36:22] but see if you quench it just right at
[1:36:24] the right temperature at the right time
[1:36:26] in the in the oil just right
[1:36:29] you're going to have a blade that'll
[1:36:30] hold an edge sharper than anything
[1:36:33] and it's still flexible it can bend when
[1:36:36] it needs to bend but it won't break
[1:36:40] and it doesn't just conform to whatever
[1:36:42] force comes against it
[1:36:43] no it can bend but it doesn't break and
[1:36:45] you know it comes and snaps right back
[1:36:47] that's the kind of christian god's
[1:36:48] making right now he's making rugged
[1:36:50] soldiers that can take the pressure
[1:36:54] that can take like iron sharpening iron
[1:36:56] can can take that sharpening to hold an
[1:36:58] edge
[1:36:59] but yet when it gets into combat doesn't
[1:37:01] break under the stress
[1:37:03] so don't worry about the trials they've
[1:37:05] come to prove you
[1:37:07] they've come to prove to you who he is
[1:37:09] and he makes a way of escape with every
[1:37:11] temptation
[1:37:13] but just realize when those when those
[1:37:14] temptations come
[1:37:16] you're walking through the world or
[1:37:18] you're going you know you go through the
[1:37:19] store and you see the things on tv now
[1:37:22] and all the insanity that's going on or
[1:37:23] the devil tries to bring something along
[1:37:25] your path and all of a sudden you feel
[1:37:26] that temptation you know what he says he
[1:37:28] says joy james said he said
[1:37:32] rejoice it sounds almost crazy
[1:37:36] lord
[1:37:38] oh and i could feel that pull towards
[1:37:39] that towards towards
[1:37:41] that that envy spirit
[1:37:44] praise the lord
[1:37:46] why because you could feel it
[1:37:48] and if you can see that that means the
[1:37:50] devil's exposed
[1:37:52] he tried to launch his ambush he was
[1:37:54] hiding in the cover then he poked his
[1:37:56] ugly head out to try to try to get you
[1:37:58] on the road
[1:37:59] but then you trained your sights on him
[1:38:01] he said lord thank you for revealing it
[1:38:03] to me what i got what i got to cover
[1:38:05] and then you get to prayer they say lord
[1:38:08] i don't want to have that i don't want
[1:38:09] to have that pull in my life anymore
[1:38:13] i hope that makes sense to of all of us
[1:38:16] so as we go to communion this evening
[1:38:19] you just cast all your cares upon him
[1:38:21] for he cares for you
[1:38:22] no matter what trial you're in right now
[1:38:25] remember it's for your benefit
[1:38:27] it's for your benefit it's not for the
[1:38:30] devil
[1:38:32] the devil's already defeated
[1:38:34] and he's performing his work he's done
[1:38:36] he's doing what he does
[1:38:37] the one thing about the devil remember
[1:38:39] he's a good adversary
[1:38:41] but he's nothing but a defeated foe
[1:38:43] before the children of god
[1:38:46] so all you have to do is trust in what
[1:38:47] he's made you to be
[1:38:50] it seems so simple
[1:38:51] but how many times how many sometimes
[1:38:53] feel like you're so far from it
[1:38:55] because you look at yourself we're
[1:38:57] looking at our own things
[1:38:59] so let's just
[1:39:00] bow our heads in a word of prayer and
[1:39:01] we'll have brother billy come
[1:39:06] maybe we just
[1:39:07] bring this before the people lord jesus
[1:39:13] lord to the world that would seem such a
[1:39:15] a a paradoxical thing
[1:39:19] lord and even
[1:39:20] to
[1:39:22] the laodicean christian mind it would
[1:39:25] seem
[1:39:26] maybe a silly thing lord
[1:39:28] to rejoice
[1:39:29] when we're tempted
[1:39:31] to rejoice
[1:39:32] when we fall into trials and
[1:39:34] tribulations
[1:39:36] but lord as you've called us in this age
[1:39:39] and given us
[1:39:40] that prophetic insight that your prophet
[1:39:42] spoke of
[1:39:43] to give us those those eagle eyes oh god
[1:39:46] to anoint us in this eagle age to see
[1:39:49] lord that we could recognize the devil
[1:39:51] in every one of his
[1:39:52] tricks and then lord as we heard
[1:39:56] lord to when we recognize that spirit
[1:39:59] to resist that spirit by the holy spirit
[1:40:03] lord because we know we can't do it on
[1:40:04] our own
[1:40:06] but lord we believe and we're trusting
[1:40:08] lord and who you've made us to be who
[1:40:10] you've called us to be
[1:40:11] that seed that you placed in us before
[1:40:13] the foundation of the world

[1:40:18] to stand we stand
[1:40:20] lord because we know
[1:40:24] lord that those tears and
[1:40:26] the trials may endure for a night but
[1:40:28] joy cometh in the morning
[1:40:31] lord if there be anybody here oh god
[1:40:33] that says lord i i just lord i've gone
[1:40:36] through so many trials
[1:40:39] i've gone through many temptations lord
[1:40:42] maybe i'm going through a temptation or
[1:40:43] a trial even now
[1:40:46] lord
[1:40:47] help me to see the enemy in the trial
[1:40:50] lord may you highlight that enemy for me
[1:40:52] lord where i could i could be aware of
[1:40:54] him and what where where that pull might
[1:40:56] be if there's a temptation
[1:40:58] lord that's trying to draw me away oh
[1:41:00] god you'd help me to recognize that
[1:41:02] temptation
[1:41:03] lord to cover it over with prayer to
[1:41:05] cover it over with the word
[1:41:07] to cover it over with the holy ghost in
[1:41:08] that token
[1:41:10] to place it there before you lord jesus
[1:41:12] to repent lord
[1:41:14] and place it before you lord jesus
[1:41:16] lord and then lord to recognize you
[1:41:20] that you're our sufficiency lord that

[1:41:39] that as you are so are we in this world
[1:41:42] lord you're bringing a people to that
[1:41:44] place
[1:41:46] lord where i believe it would be said
[1:41:48] just as it was at antioch that they
[1:41:49] called them christians
[1:41:51] not because lord there was a profession
[1:41:54] of their mouth but that there was a life
[1:41:56] lord that there was a life so powerfully
[1:41:59] lived by the holy ghost in them
[1:42:02] that even the heathen
[1:42:04] couldn't help but see that there
[1:42:06] couldn't be anything else but the very
[1:42:07] life of god being lived through those
[1:42:09] people
[1:42:10] and lord i know that you're bringing a
[1:42:12] bride to that place even now you're
[1:42:14] living it out in your people now
[1:42:16] lord i pray lord as we go to communion
[1:42:18] oh god that we would just have every
[1:42:20] heart cleansed lord
[1:42:22] that we just place everything before you
[1:42:24] lord god and
[1:42:25] lord place it underneath the blood oh
[1:42:27] god
[1:42:28] may we just apply that token now
[1:42:31] lord we're not trusting in our own
[1:42:32] merits oh god but we're believing lord
[1:42:34] in that full atonement we're coming
[1:42:36] underneath that full atonement lord we
[1:42:38] believe it father we accept it may you
[1:42:40] give us the grace to move ourselves out
[1:42:42] of the way oh god and let you live
[1:42:44] through us
[1:42:45] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:42:46] pray amen

[1:42:57] amen aren't you happy for the master's
[1:42:59] hand amen
[1:43:01] you know
[1:43:05] even as our brother said god is trying
[1:43:07] to prove to ourselves
[1:43:11] you know you
[1:43:13] you think about those trials and those
[1:43:16] temptations and
[1:43:19] the perfectly packaged for you and
[1:43:22] for each and every one of us he knows
[1:43:24] exactly what you have need of and he
[1:43:27] knows
[1:43:28] in fact the scripture tells us that he
[1:43:30] actually even knows the measure
[1:43:33] he says no temptation comes to where he
[1:43:35] could take you
[1:43:36] he says but with every temptation god
[1:43:39] supplies the way
[1:43:40] so he can get the the desires result as
[1:43:43] he was as our brother randy was
[1:43:45] preaching i i thought about you know
[1:43:48] this the message tells us that you know
[1:43:51] when the bride when that church when we
[1:43:54] recognize who we are
[1:43:55] well
[1:43:56] we need some testing to recognize who we
[1:43:59] are
[1:44:00] we need to to go to this testing systems
[1:44:03] you know to to come to the realization
[1:44:06] of who we are
[1:44:07] amen it's not just by you working up and
[1:44:09] saying i know who i am no there's got to
[1:44:12] be some adversity something standing on
[1:44:14] your way
[1:44:15] for you to realize
[1:44:17] i'm not this and i'm this this is what i
[1:44:20] desire and god taking you through all of
[1:44:22] that that's what the scripture says it's
[1:44:23] more precious than gold
[1:44:26] because through those temptations
[1:44:28] he actually brings us in fellowship with
[1:44:30] god
[1:44:32] because we need him we want him to walk
[1:44:34] with us we want him to take us through
[1:44:36] those things we want to fellowship with
[1:44:39] him even more amen as the brothers of
[1:44:41] bringing the communion let's just turn
[1:44:43] our bibles open our
[1:44:46] bibles first corinthians chapter 11.
[1:45:03] the 23rd verse it says
[1:45:08] for i res i have receiver of the lord
[1:45:11] that which i also deliver unto you
[1:45:14] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:45:16] which
[1:45:17] he was betrayed took bread
[1:45:19] and when he had given tanks he breaked
[1:45:22] it he break it and said
[1:45:24] take eat this is my body
[1:45:27] which is broken for you
[1:45:30] do this in remembrance of me
[1:45:33] and after the same manner he also took
[1:45:35] the cup
[1:45:37] when he had stopped saying
[1:45:39] this is this is a new testament of my
[1:45:43] blood
[1:45:44] do
[1:45:45] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:45:49] remembrance of me
[1:45:51] for as off
[1:45:52] as often as ye eat
[1:45:54] this bread
[1:45:56] and drink this cup ye this
[1:45:59] show the lord's death till i come
[1:46:03] wherefore whosoever shall eat and and
[1:46:06] shall
[1:46:07] shall eat this bread and drink the scalp
[1:46:10] of the lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:46:12] of the body and the blood of the lord
[1:46:15] but let every man examine himself so let
[1:46:18] him eat
[1:46:19] of the bread and drink of the cup
[1:46:23] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:46:25] unworthily either and drink it damn eat
[1:46:27] it and drink a damnation to himself not
[1:46:30] discerning the lord's body
[1:46:33] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:46:36] among you and many
[1:46:38] sleep for if i would
[1:46:41] he says for if we would
[1:46:44] judge
[1:46:45] ourselves
[1:46:46] we should not be judged
[1:46:48] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:46:51] off the lord that we should not be
[1:46:53] condemned with the world
[1:46:56] wherefore my brethren when ye come
[1:46:58] together to eat
[1:47:00] carry one for another
[1:47:02] and if any man hungered
[1:47:05] let him eat at home
[1:47:07] that ye may come not together
[1:47:09] unto condemnation and the rest will i
[1:47:12] set in order when i come
[1:47:15] amen i like this and it says
[1:47:18] when we come
[1:47:21] it's a scary one for another
[1:47:24] and even is
[1:47:25] saying that
[1:47:28] when we are judged we are judged
[1:47:32] so that we are not we are chastened off
[1:47:35] the lord so we are not condemned with
[1:47:37] the world
[1:47:39] let every man examine himself
[1:47:41] even as our brother said that trial that
[1:47:43] temptation that place it's to cause
[1:47:46] self-examination where you look at
[1:47:48] yourself and you realize lord i need
[1:47:51] help with this lord i need help with
[1:47:53] this and i believe even when communion
[1:47:55] when we come we receive strength from
[1:47:58] communion to say lord that desire for
[1:48:00] you to provide me the healing that i
[1:48:02] need the deliverance that i need the
[1:48:05] things that i need i'm here to receive
[1:48:07] of you
[1:48:08] for me to be a better christian
[1:48:11] amen let's just bring it so to pray
