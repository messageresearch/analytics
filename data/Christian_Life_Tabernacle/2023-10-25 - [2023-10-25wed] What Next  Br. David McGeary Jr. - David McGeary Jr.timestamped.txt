[29:51] gracious Heavenly Father what a glorious
[29:55] thing a glorious mystery that you you
[29:57] would come in the likeness of sinful
[29:59] flesh that you would bear Humanity that
[30:02] you would be tempted in all manner as we
[30:04] were that you would hunger that you
[30:06] would feel pain that you would suffer
[30:08] and Lord it was all that we could have
[30:11] fellowship and communion with you or
[30:14] that you could be a high priest that
[30:15] could be touched by the filling of our
[30:17] infirmities so that when we would go to
[30:19] you in
[30:20] need Lord you would be
[30:23] moved father there's many needs that
[30:26] were spoken tonight just lift them up to
[30:28] you again we know that it's a finished
[30:30] work by your stripes we are healed Lord
[30:32] we ask that the provision that's been
[30:34] provided for us in your word tonight

[30:41] substance we have need of Lord Lord

[30:45] come now may you just stand between the
[30:48] lips of the speaker and the hearer may
[30:49] you anoint each word father may you feed
[30:52] your sheep we pray we commit it to you
[30:54] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[30:56] Christ we pray
[30:58] amen amen God bless you if you turn in
[31:01] your Bibles we're going to take a text
[31:02] from 2 Kings uh chapter
[31:05] 7 and verse
[31:08] three just continuing on uh
[31:14] with what I see is just a theme of what
[31:16] the Lord's been dealing with and uh from
[31:19] the servants that our pastor Min
[31:22] ministered out of Investments I find
[31:25] this as we go it hope we'll just uh
[31:28] compliment and go
[31:32] further down the line but uh 2 Kings
[31:38] 7:3 and there were four leprous men at
[31:41] the entering of the gate and they said
[31:43] one to another why sit we here until we
[31:45] die if we say we will enter into the
[31:48] city then the famine is in the city and
[31:51] we shall die there and if we sit here we
[31:54] die also now therefore come let let us
[31:57] fall unto the host of the syrians if
[32:00] they save us alive we shall live and if
[32:03] they kill us we shall but die God bless
[32:06] you you may have your
[32:10] seats the setting here is one where I
[32:13] feel that these leprous men probably ask
[32:17] themselves I think a question that's a a
[32:19] common question when people come into a
[32:21] place where God's dealing with their
[32:23] heart and it was what next I I think
[32:26] they they looked at the scenario they
[32:29] they counted the cost and if you could
[32:32] catch the scene it's a besieged city
[32:35] there's an an enemy Army has has been
[32:38] arrayed against the city and they're
[32:40] selling uh food the dung of a pigeon for
[32:44] like four things of silver uh it you
[32:47] know the our minds and and what we could
[32:51] comprehend I don't think any of us could
[32:54] understand the the depravity of man but
[32:56] just in the previous chapter talks about
[32:58] uh two mothers having come to the place
[33:01] of such hunger they made an agreement on
[33:03] Whose child they would eat first and uh
[33:07] one of the the mothers is now beseeching
[33:10] the king
[33:11] because the mother that had agreed to go
[33:14] first had boiled her child and now the
[33:17] second mother had hid hers and and just
[33:20] to catch uh that place of humanity a
[33:24] mother the love for a child how they had
[33:26] gone beyond the bounds uh so the
[33:30] condition in the land is one where these
[33:32] lepers are on the outside of the gate
[33:35] they're on the entering end of the city
[33:36] they're outside of that Calamity if you
[33:38] will and they probably in some ways were
[33:41] better off than what was going on inside
[33:45] maybe they didn't understand even what
[33:47] was transpiring
[33:48] entirely but one of the things that they
[33:51] caught was the desperation of the moment
[33:53] the desperation of the hour they were in
[33:56] they they made made a fair assessment if
[33:58] we stay here we die and the hour we live
[34:02] in is no different the Calamity that is
[34:06] outside it's death it's most certain
[34:09] death if you think you have the
[34:11] wherewithal to withstand the enemy in
[34:13] this hour uh you would be doomed left to
[34:16] your own devices matter of fact uh it
[34:20] just thinking of what he's wanting to
[34:25] accomplish and there's no saity to it
[34:28] anymore it's just out in the open he's
[34:31] declared he set The Siege and I'm so
[34:33] thankful the promise that when the enemy
[34:36] comes in like a flood God will raise a
[34:38] standard up against it we're not uh
[34:41] we're not dismayed by the hour we were
[34:44] told it would be here we we've got a
[34:46] place of Refuge that we've uh We've sold
[34:51] out to and that's what these guys did
[34:53] they sold out they had to make the
[34:55] decision you know what even if we go to
[34:57] the to the syrians and they kill us it's
[35:01] really no end in the situation but
[35:03] there's a hope they had this vague hope
[35:06] that that's really the only option we
[35:08] have and so they committed to it they
[35:10] sold out they saw that there might be a
[35:13] place of provision there now what they
[35:15] didn't even understand is that they're
[35:17] actually playing a part in a prophecy so
[35:20] in their desperation they are answering
[35:24] now to a call to a desire and they don't
[35:27] even understand that they're now walking
[35:29] in Prophecy because Elijah had promised
[35:33] that before the day was
[35:36] over that there was going to be such
[35:39] plenty that you know it's just right
[35:42] there in the first of the the chapter
[35:44] verse one says then Elisha said hear ye
[35:46] the words of the Lord thus sayith the
[35:48] Lord tomorrow about this time shall a
[35:51] measure of flour be sold for a shekele
[35:53] and two measures of barley for a shekele
[35:56] in the gate of of Samaria So within a
[35:58] day span it's going to go
[36:02] from starvation from Calamity and the
[36:08] the person who sought Elisha from the on
[36:10] the order of the king he he has a
[36:13] response to this prophecy he says then
[36:16] the Lord of those who uh the Lord on
[36:18] Whose hand the king leaned answered the
[36:20] man of God and said behold if the Lord
[36:23] would make Windows in heaven might this
[36:26] thing be
[36:27] and he said behold this is Elisha now
[36:30] answering back to him because his
[36:32] response his attitude towards the word
[36:34] of the Prophet was well maybe maybe if
[36:37] you know the windows of Heaven open and
[36:40] you know it
[36:41] was I maybe that was I a good response
[36:46] right I you know if you put yourself in
[36:48] that situation and you just could take
[36:50] in everything that was happening now
[36:52] you're trying to interpret the prophecy
[36:54] you're sitting there and go well you
[36:55] know maybe so oh if God puts windows in
[36:58] heaven and that's his interpretation of
[37:01] the prophecy is you know but because of
[37:05] his approach towards the word of God
[37:08] Elisha tells him he
[37:11] says it's not you won't partake of
[37:14] it so you know we want to have the right
[37:19] attitude and right approach towards the
[37:21] Prophecies of God towards the word of
[37:22] God when it's spoken sir it's you don't
[37:25] need to inter it this man you know I I
[37:29] don't know how harsh his attitude was it
[37:31] seems like maybe he was trying to say
[37:33] God's a mighty God maybe he'll open the
[37:35] windows of Heaven um but he because of
[37:39] how the prophet you could see his uh
[37:42] answer to it he tells him you're not
[37:44] going to partake of it he says behold if
[37:48] God would make Windows in heaven might
[37:50] this thing be and he said behold Thou
[37:53] shalt see it with thine eyes but Thou
[37:55] shalt not eat thereof
[38:00] um we want to partake we want to eat of
[38:04] the Bountiful things of God we don't
[38:05] want to just have the wrong attitude and
[38:07] the wrong approach that puts it off for
[38:09] someone else but we want to be partakers
[38:11] of it so the the leopards in my
[38:14] assessment they did some good math right
[38:17] they they decided that if we stay here
[38:20] we die and they moved on and in verse 5
[38:23] that says that as they arose in the
[38:25] Twilight to go into the camp of the
[38:27] syrians and when they had come into the
[38:29] uttermost part of the camp of Syria
[38:31] behold there was no man there for the
[38:34] Lord had made the host of the syrians to
[38:35] hear a noise of Chariots and a noise of
[38:38] horses even the noise of a great host
[38:40] and they said one to another Lo the
[38:42] Kings of Israel have hired against us
[38:44] the kings of the Hittites and the kings
[38:46] of the Egyptians to come upon us
[38:48] wherefore they arose and they fled and
[38:50] the Twilight and left their tents and
[38:52] their horses and their asses and E even
[38:54] the camp as it was and and fled for
[38:57] their life and when the leopards came to
[39:00] the uttermost part of the camp they went
[39:02] into one tent and did eat and drink and
[39:05] carried then silver and gold and
[39:07] rainment and went and hid it and came
[39:10] again and entered into another tent and
[39:12] carried hint also and went and hid it so
[39:16] there's such a bounty that their first
[39:18] approach is this is
[39:20] ours let's make provision for
[39:23] ourselves and they do this
[39:25] twice at this point they're kind of
[39:28] making like I think we're getting tired
[39:30] of carrying all this stuff and hiding it
[39:32] and we've done it twice now you know the
[39:36] thing the goodness of God is starting to
[39:38] overflow here a little bit all right and
[39:41] when God does a work there's more than
[39:44] enough so they decide they got to go
[39:46] tell
[39:48] somebody if the Lord does something for
[39:50] you and it's a genuine work of the Lord
[39:53] you can't keep it to yourself matter of
[39:55] fact you
[39:57] it's not in the
[39:58] formula you you try to keep it to
[40:00] yourself you're going to bust an NN
[40:02] vessel with some new
[40:04] wine it's not in the
[40:06] formula
[40:09] um
[40:12] now verse N I believe that's where we're
[40:15] at then they said one to another we do
[40:18] not we do not well this is a day of Good
[40:22] Tidings and we hold our peace if we tar
[40:25] till the morning light some Mischief
[40:27] will come upon us now therefore come
[40:30] that we may go and tell the king's
[40:32] household so they came and called the
[40:34] Porter of the city and they told them
[40:36] saying we came to the camp of the
[40:38] syrians and behold there was no man
[40:40] there neither voice of man nor horse
[40:43] tied and the asses tied and the tents
[40:45] are as they were and he called the
[40:47] Porter and they told the King's house
[40:49] within
[40:51] now notice the fear of the Lord if you
[40:54] will upon him this is beyond our own
[40:57] doing it would be a travesty to keep
[41:01] this to ourselves we've got to go bear
[41:04] The Good
[41:05] Tidings and it ended up being the
[41:07] salvation of the people could you
[41:09] imagine even in the moments they
[41:13] wasted there was death in the city while
[41:16] they were taking their treasure and
[41:19] packing it out and saying this is all
[41:21] for me praise the Lord what a beautiful
[41:23] thing that that the Lord's done there
[41:25] was people perishing for hunger and
[41:29] starve Starving in the
[41:33] city
[41:38] and I don't need to draw a parallel that
[41:41] you you know what we're what we
[41:43] have I mean we we're feasting there's
[41:47] plenty we have the spoils we have a
[41:50] message that just dressing us in a
[41:51] wedding garment you know we're we're
[41:53] going to sit at the banquet table
[41:56] and it's God's provided place and it's
[42:00] not just so we can hoard it up for
[42:04] ourselves it is
[42:07] not uh we want the urgency of the
[42:11] hour to be to to catch us we I if if
[42:16] it's it's gross Darkness on the face of
[42:19] the people it's gross Darkness every
[42:22] moment you wait there's someone who
[42:25] could just be going further into the
[42:27] depths of sin and you have the very
[42:29] thing that could keep them from being
[42:31] scarred that could keep them from it it
[42:35] it's a word that sets free we we're not
[42:38] ashamed of this gospel it's the power of
[42:40] God to
[42:41] deliver you know the
[42:44] uh the holy spirit is here to brood out
[42:47] over his word you're a carrier of the
[42:49] very life you're a Son of God whatever
[42:52] the devil would do to neutralize you in
[42:54] your testimony you you have to say boo
[42:57] devil we're not in this hour this late
[43:00] in the game to to be bench
[43:03] Riders we're we're not to gather
[43:05] ourselves together in an assembly and
[43:08] not think that we don't have need of a
[43:09] daily bread and the daily portion from
[43:11] us we we should become pulling we should
[43:14] become hungry we should come thinking
[43:16] Lord what is it that I have need of
[43:18] because if you want to be uh poured
[43:22] out you want to be filled you're going
[43:24] to have to be poured out
[43:26] right so there there should be something
[43:28] that has transpired in your walk to be
[43:31] here some rub some you know some
[43:34] challenges where you've poured yourself
[43:36] out in prayer for the burdens of the
[43:38] that's in your heart for the for the
[43:40] Lost there there should be something
[43:42] that's transpiring so that when you come
[43:44] to the house of God you're hungry and
[43:46] your expectation is Lord fill me I've
[43:49] been poured out if you're coming and
[43:52] you're you're kind of content I will say
[43:55] it's not for one it's because there's no
[43:57] want in the word but are you are you
[43:59] giving it
[44:02] out it it have you found the burden that
[44:05] is your lot to carry and that's kind of
[44:09] what's on my heart as the Lord would
[44:11] lead I go ahead and turn to Matthew uh
[44:13] chapter
[44:14] 16 verse 24 the very familiar scripture
[44:19] I believe this is really another way of
[44:21] what was presented to the Rich Young
[44:23] Ruler and uh
[44:26] as we know what was challenged to him
[44:30] was to sell all he had and he was
[44:33] sorrowful I don't think he did good
[44:36] math I think that for him being a a Rich
[44:39] Young Ruler the leopards somehow
[44:42] understood that the question was more of
[44:45] that of life or death than the Rich
[44:47] Young Ruler did he thought it was just
[44:49] of monitary maybe it was his status
[44:52] maybe it was the ease of life that he
[44:54] was at question but really what was a
[44:56] question was his eternal destination and
[44:59] he didn't understand what was set before
[45:03] him in Matthew 16: 24 Jesus said unto
[45:07] his disciples if a man come after me let
[45:09] him deny himself and take up his cross
[45:11] and follow me for whosoever shall save
[45:15] his life shall lose it and whosoever
[45:17] shall lose his life for my sake shall
[45:19] find it for what is a man profited if he
[45:23] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[45:25] own soul Soul or what shall a man give
[45:27] in exchange for his
[45:30] soul the the the
[45:33] challenge that is presented in in 26
[45:36] there is what is a man profited it's a
[45:38] good question it means that you need to
[45:40] if you're going to do math I mean what's
[45:42] profit it's what you have left over in
[45:45] excess after you've paid the the bills
[45:48] after you've counted the cost of what it
[45:50] takes to do business profit is what you
[45:52] would have left over so if you're going
[45:55] to to sit back and you're going to
[45:56] assess the situation you're going to say
[45:58] what does it profit me what is it really
[46:00] going to benefit me if I was the best
[46:04] Mother Teresa out there I was to build a
[46:06] bunch of hospitals I was to meet the
[46:07] needs of the people I was a good man uh
[46:10] you did not hunger I'm I'm quite the
[46:13] philosopher I I can I can encourage you
[46:15] in the way I can do all these things for
[46:18] Humanity but if the soul is left wanting
[46:21] and lost you've accomplished Net
[46:24] Zero at the end of the day it's vanity
[46:28] the Ecclesiastes concludes the matter to
[46:30] fear God because all the things are
[46:31] going to be found out um and nothing of
[46:35] man really
[46:37] last the Calamity of man's complete
[46:41] we're seeing it in this very last day we
[46:44] what one of the benefits we have is
[46:46] because of the the technology is there's
[46:50] really no person even what was it Elon
[46:52] Musk couldn't fly his jet around without
[46:54] someone tracking it you know so he he he
[46:58] he like tried to pay a kid to not track
[47:00] his jet it the understanding of what man
[47:04] can accomplish is readily
[47:06] available and it's all
[47:09] Calamity you know they're they're
[47:11] Landing satellites on asteroids and
[47:15] bringing back
[47:19] dust and it blows my mind what must have
[47:22] gone into that to accomplish that
[47:26] they brought back dirt from
[47:29] space and that's what man's consumed
[47:32] with they they want to beat this thing
[47:35] somehow and in the end it's it's all
[47:38] dust it's all going to be burnt right
[47:41] and Jesus is telling them this and
[47:46] yet the equation
[47:49] somehow is lost on
[47:53] people and I think that's a
[47:56] still the humanity of man if we could
[48:00] come into one mind and one Accord
[48:02] there's one thing that we all face we're
[48:04] mortal when if we can conclude if you
[48:07] could grasp the conclusion of the matter
[48:11] that there's no one that's going to come
[48:12] any other way that we're going to come
[48:15] before Jesus Christ there is no other
[48:17] way even those who haven't met him now
[48:19] on this side are going to meet him one
[48:21] day they're going to see who he was that
[48:24] he was the savior he was their Refuge he
[48:26] was their way of Salvation and they
[48:28] could have everything that he was they
[48:30] could have had and they'll S stand in
[48:33] that day knowing that they spurned the
[48:36] very way of
[48:37] Salvation now for
[48:39] us I don't think it's any less a a
[48:43] challenge for us daily to count the cost
[48:47] to understand what's set before us and
[48:50] die out daily because there's only one
[48:52] way of Refuge that's in his Spirit
[48:54] there's only one one one provided place
[48:58] is is is by the Holy Ghost living
[49:02] through you shed abroad in your life
[49:04] there's too many times I find that well
[49:06] I'll let this old nature seemingly try
[49:08] to press in and what's the Holy Spirit
[49:10] do convict your heart of sin now the
[49:14] this this message has so fortified us to
[49:18] understand our position and our calling
[49:20] that we know we can get back up as Sons
[49:23] and Daughters of God and possess our
[49:24] inheritance this body doesn't have rule
[49:27] over us it's defeated it was crucified
[49:30] at Calvary greater is he that's in you
[49:32] than he that's in the world the
[49:34] expectation we should have because of
[49:37] the victory of Calvary because of the
[49:39] you've counted the cost I trust each one
[49:41] here has counted the cost and when I
[49:43] when I talk about uh being in the place
[49:46] where you've seen that there it's a
[49:47] choice of life or death you've decided
[49:50] my life is not worth living I don't want
[49:53] to live my life even at my best I
[49:55] couldn't do anything that's of Eternal
[49:59] value the in my life the things I swed
[50:02] was hurt Strife sorrow and David McGary
[50:06] even at my best even if I was to esteem
[50:09] that I could do something really amazing
[50:11] which I have no natural ability to do it
[50:14] would be vanity I'm actually comforted
[50:16] in the fact that this gospel gives hope
[50:18] to the Hopeless I mean that's what's
[50:20] happening with the leopards at that gate
[50:23] here's the Hopeless of hopeless and
[50:25] who's the ones who find themselves in
[50:28] the place of being able to be a voice of
[50:31] Salvation I don't care what your
[50:33] position is you may think you're
[50:34] worthless but with the voice of God in
[50:37] you of what he's done for you you can be
[50:39] the Salvation to the most desperate
[50:42] people this gospel is not a one that's a
[50:45] respector of
[50:47] persons you know the the good news is is
[50:51] that he'll take the most vile of Sinner
[50:54] and One Moment In His presence he's just
[50:58] as good and blood-washed as the minister
[51:01] who's been preaching for 25 years you've
[51:03] got of what of value in
[51:06] you and you have the ability to give it
[51:09] you can't give what you ain't
[51:11] got if there's one thing that would even
[51:14] compel you if you were to esteem uh the
[51:17] value of the others in your life around
[51:19] you that I would say if that could
[51:23] compel you to ask God to give you a
[51:25] refilling of the Holy Spirit and to set
[51:27] you on fire and to allow you to be used
[51:29] of him that would be a good cause to do
[51:33] it if you feel that you've arrived and
[51:36] you're content in your salvation and uh
[51:38] you know where you're going well let's
[51:41] get to overflowing you know let's let's
[51:43] get to where you can't contain it let's
[51:46] get to where the joy bells are ringing
[51:48] and you let's you know I think back just
[51:50] think back of where you came
[51:53] from you know I I look at the grace of
[51:55] God for me when I was a young man I
[51:57] think I was around I I probably around
[52:00] sixth grade for those who know what age
[52:02] that is and I'd gone to a there was a
[52:05] tape meeting I believe it was in Hot
[52:07] Springs Arkansas and it was a somewhat
[52:09] of a I believe like a an a uh an annual
[52:14] thing where they're playing a tape
[52:15] inside the YMCA Center where brother
[52:18] brandom
[52:22] administered I remember it uh
[52:26] because as a young man I wasn't in the
[52:29] service the the sanctuary area where
[52:31] they had set up the the service to play
[52:33] the tape was full I was sitting out in
[52:35] the hallway uh in some folding chairs
[52:39] and towards the end of the service as
[52:41] the Lord was moving there was a
[52:44] crying just pardon me find my voice but
[52:48] and the Lord was moving inside the
[52:50] sanctuary and I remember my father
[52:52] coming out to me he says now be reverent
[52:55] that's the Lord moving in there and I
[52:57] don't couldn't tell you what moved on me
[53:00] but I found myself out in the parking
[53:03] lot in a in a little Astro Minivan and
[53:07] the prayer I prayed was Lord your God if
[53:10] you could be in there you could be out
[53:13] here too and the presence of the Lord
[53:15] Jesus Christ dropped down into that into
[53:17] that van and I knew whose presence I was
[53:20] in it changed
[53:23] me the gra of God ministered at the
[53:27] voice to this
[53:29] age that the Lord would
[53:32] come I didn't even know there was a
[53:34] presence to be
[53:36] felt if you've never experienced the
[53:38] Lord you don't even know that's
[53:41] right so who are you coming in contact
[53:45] with do they know what it's
[53:47] like you know the song I I tried to
[53:50] teach it I believe to some of the young
[53:52] people until you know the loving hand
[53:53] that reaches down to fall Fallen man and
[53:56] picks him up from out of sin where he's
[53:58] gone until you
[54:00] know just what it's like to know that
[54:02] God's really real you know nothing until
[54:05] you know the love of
[54:07] God that's what you want to come in
[54:09] contact with that's for everybody I've
[54:11] seen the Lord answer prayers to just
[54:13] give someone a touch to know that he's
[54:19] real and then this becomes a new book
[54:23] Faith's delivered don't let that faith
[54:26] not be of
[54:27] use what you should be able to do by
[54:30] knowing God's real the author of this
[54:31] book is standing behind it when you come
[54:33] in contact him it says take Hands of
[54:35] Faith and take God's word and
[54:39] stand that's the expectation what's next
[54:42] when you've stood on God's word watch
[54:44] him keep his
[54:46] promises he he they're Bountiful if
[54:49] you're hungry you'll be
[54:52] filled amen amen
[54:57] you know the the thing that you find is
[54:59] that the choice for us is clear every
[55:02] day we should be trusting in God in his
[55:05] provided place in his word we've been
[55:08] given a gift of faith to do that and we
[55:10] should go forward in it but what's the
[55:13] alternative to trust in man to trust in
[55:16] your reasoning to trust in your logic I
[55:18] think sometimes we don't even understand
[55:21] sometimes what we're leaning to what
[55:22] we're hitching our wagon to we're
[55:24] leaning to our own understanding we're
[55:26] not walking by faith we've we've come
[55:28] into a place of comfort there's
[55:31] uh there's strengths that we rely on our
[55:36] own understanding maybe you have the
[55:37] ability to figure it out um and and uh
[55:41] you know when you've arrived at a sound
[55:43] understanding of something and you lean
[55:45] on
[55:46] that but in the end of the day that's
[55:48] not the wedding garment that we have to
[55:50] be clothed in it it's not you know this
[55:54] the scary part is is that someone could
[55:56] find themselves at the table and not be
[55:59] dressed in the wedding garment and and
[56:01] my question is how could you come in all
[56:04] that far and find another way besides
[56:07] Christ Jesus CU he called him friend
[56:14] right I mean that what's a friend
[56:17] someone that knows what's going on
[56:19] that's how the scripture describes a
[56:21] friend but he wasn't
[56:23] dressed and the wedding garment and the
[56:27] wedding garment's the Holy Spirit and
[56:30] and I have a lengthy quote I try to to
[56:32] read it but
[56:35] um I'll say it this way there's a voice
[56:39] that's doing the dressing in the wedding
[56:40] garment and it's the same voice that
[56:43] delivered the faith to the disciples
[56:47] it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's the O
[56:49] bleeding bloody word and there is no
[56:52] other place of
[56:53] Refuge
[56:55] it's that's just not I GNA be there you
[57:01] could actually do so good as a as the
[57:04] Rich Young Ruler I think the Rich Young
[57:05] Ruler epitomizes the same thing that
[57:08] kind of happens at the wedding supper
[57:10] where you have someone who's done all
[57:12] these
[57:14] things and they've done them but they
[57:17] didn't our Pastor said something that
[57:19] astounded me Jesus Christ looking at the
[57:22] finality of the matter knew the man
[57:24] didn't have what it
[57:26] took and and so he
[57:29] prescribed something specific to him
[57:32] that that told him what he needed to do
[57:35] sell all thou thou Hast give it all up
[57:39] and follow me and the man sorrowed
[57:41] because he because he had great wealth
[57:43] but how foolish and what would the
[57:45] challenge be to each of us I don't know
[57:49] it could be your it could be hey you
[57:51] know I this is my comfort zone whatever
[57:55] that is we've been asked to die to self
[57:58] to give it up and seek that his presence
[58:01] would have the preeminence in our life
[58:03] and that's my desire I don't I don't
[58:05] want to live my day dayto day thinking
[58:08] that it's just uh going to be the works
[58:11] of these mortal hands that's accounted
[58:13] to me on the day that I go on but I want
[58:17] when I cross over there to be well done
[58:19] my faithful servant I want to see
[58:21] converts that have been W to Christ I
[58:24] want to know that hey when I was down
[58:26] you were you were the one who gave a
[58:28] word and it was this word right you're a
[58:31] carrier of
[58:33] life and that's the the office we have
[58:37] as Sons and Daughters of God the
[58:39] greatest privilege you have is to give
[58:41] the gift of eternal life that's and
[58:43] Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[58:45] word you're the very Oracles of God
[58:47] lived
[58:48] out that's the power that you possess
[58:52] little Messiahs little children children
[58:55] of God the the stands of faith that are
[58:58] taking place within in this very body
[59:01] people taking faith in God's word and
[59:03] standing on it is the thing that God
[59:05] Delights in amen and I we want to be
[59:09] fellow partakers in those we want to be
[59:11] uh part of the soldiers that are
[59:13] fighting those
[59:14] battles I'm going to read
[59:17] uh I'm going to try to be quick in
[59:20] reading this I don't know U how long
[59:22] I've been but I I feel that uh if you
[59:26] can uh it's going to be in Revelations
[59:29] it's preached in 60 in December
[59:33] 31st chapter 4 but this is a
[59:36] quote um now the scene is changing
[59:40] John's been watching patmas and now he
[59:43] looks up why he sees something went on
[59:45] on Earth these Church ages all down
[59:48] seven Church ages and then after he got
[59:50] through seeing the church ages after
[59:52] that after the church ages has seen
[59:54] ceased he heard a voice and he looked up
[59:56] towards heaven and he seen an open door
[59:59] and the first voice sounded like a
[1:00:00] trumpet all right scen changed from
[1:00:03] patmas to heaven the voice was the same
[1:00:06] voice that walked in the seven golden
[1:00:08] candlesticks same voice The Voice didn't
[1:00:11] change but the voice where was it when
[1:00:14] he heard it the first time how many
[1:00:16] remembers the first church age behind
[1:00:18] him I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:00:20] Day Revelations 1 1:10 he said in the
[1:00:23] spirit if you want to put that down
[1:00:25] Revelations
[1:00:27] 1:10 and I was in the spirit on the
[1:00:30] Lord's day and I heard behind me as a
[1:00:32] voice of a trumpet and sounded like many
[1:00:34] Waters and when I turned and looked I
[1:00:36] saw one standing in the midst of the
[1:00:37] seven golden candlesticks now after he
[1:00:40] showed him all the mysteries of the
[1:00:41] seven golden candlesticks holding the
[1:00:43] Seven Stars and the white wig on and so
[1:00:46] forth and feet like brass and eyes like
[1:00:48] fire and the symbols and he heard the
[1:00:49] same voice watch speak from heaven and
[1:00:52] he looked up and he saw an Open Door
[1:00:54] door oh Open Door into heaven how are
[1:00:57] you how do you get in by Christ Jesus
[1:01:02] that one door one way no other way one
[1:01:05] man that climbed up the other way the
[1:01:07] same as the thief and a robber in the
[1:01:09] parable of the one who climbed up and
[1:01:11] was the wedding supper without a garment
[1:01:13] on was found guilty and bound and cast
[1:01:15] into outer Darkness only one way coming
[1:01:18] to the wedding supper I believe I
[1:01:19] preached on here not long ago whenever
[1:01:21] the bridegroom when a man got got
[1:01:23] married in the old country he had to
[1:01:25] give it imitations himself he was to
[1:01:27] finish the robes him furnish the robes
[1:01:29] himself so when he met that man there
[1:01:32] him setting at the supper how many
[1:01:34] remembers the parable sure you read the
[1:01:36] Bible and he found a man at the supper
[1:01:38] table without a wedding garment on this
[1:01:41] is all in the context of the voice and
[1:01:43] what is it the bridegroom stands at the
[1:01:46] door and all comes up with an invitation
[1:01:49] no man come into the father except by me
[1:01:52] all the father has given me or invited
[1:01:54] will come to me here they come give
[1:01:56] their invitation the bridegroom so that
[1:01:59] everybody would look alike that's one
[1:02:01] thing about the good old Holy Ghost
[1:02:03] religion it makes all of them look alike
[1:02:06] whether they're rich or poor Bond or
[1:02:08] free black or white male or female
[1:02:10] they're all one in Christ Jesus the
[1:02:13] bridegroom stood at the door and
[1:02:15] received the invitation put the robe on
[1:02:17] his fellow so the rich and the poor all
[1:02:19] look alike Hallelujah I'm thank God for
[1:02:23] a Holy Spirit that'll change your life
[1:02:25] and make you look alike you see someone
[1:02:27] who just wants to be a you know I want
[1:02:29] to be branded with this Holy Spirit I
[1:02:31] want to have the identity of this gospel
[1:02:34] I want to look like Christ wants me to
[1:02:36] look I want to have the character I want
[1:02:38] to listen to the music he wants me to
[1:02:39] listen to I want to dress the way he
[1:02:41] wants me to dress when you see people
[1:02:44] who start to have more of a worldly
[1:02:45] identity than they have an identity with
[1:02:47] Christ they don't got the Rob on that's
[1:02:49] true it don't fool yourself you may
[1:02:52] think you're going to make it in but if
[1:02:53] you somehow made it all all the way to
[1:02:54] the table you're going to get cast
[1:02:59] out it we we've got too
[1:03:02] much information we've got too much of a
[1:03:06] truth to think that there's anything
[1:03:07] less than Perfection that this gospel is
[1:03:10] requiring of us in this
[1:03:12] day it there there's a there's a baptism
[1:03:15] of a holy spirit on a false
[1:03:18] seed it doesn't bear the
[1:03:21] fruits it doesn't have a meekness a g
[1:03:24] Ness a kindness a
[1:03:26] longsuffering it it it it cares more
[1:03:29] about what man thinks you
[1:03:35] know we're just going to go
[1:03:46] there if you look in
[1:03:50] Matthew and go back to Matthew 16:2
[1:03:53] 24-26
[1:04:05] you may know Matthew 16 because of
[1:04:07] something that
[1:04:11] transpires in it brother brandham
[1:04:14] probably quotes this quite a bit but
[1:04:17] it's found in verse
[1:04:20] 17 you can back up in in verse 15 it's
[1:04:24] it's the question he saith unto them but
[1:04:27] whom say ye that I am and he said Simon
[1:04:31] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[1:04:33] Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:04:35] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:04:37] art th Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and
[1:04:39] Blood hath not revealed this unto you
[1:04:41] thee but my Father which is in heaven
[1:04:44] and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and
[1:04:47] Upon This Rock I will build the church
[1:04:50] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:04:53] against it and I will give unto thee the
[1:04:55] Keys of the Kingdom and of heaven and
[1:04:57] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:04:59] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:05:01] shall be loosed on Earth shall be loosed
[1:05:03] in heaven we know that as brother
[1:05:05] brandham would tell us the rightful
[1:05:08] dividing of that scripture it's not that
[1:05:10] Christ is the rock it's not that the
[1:05:12] church is the rock it's not that Peter
[1:05:14] is the rock but the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:16] Christ to you as an individual is the
[1:05:19] rock Revelation is the rock on which
[1:05:22] you're built amen um and just a little
[1:05:26] later is the
[1:05:29] parable but before we get there
[1:05:32] something
[1:05:34] transpires and that who knows what the
[1:05:36] time period is then he charged the
[1:05:39] disciples that they should tell no man
[1:05:41] that he was Jesus the
[1:05:43] Christ from that time forth began Jesus
[1:05:46] to show unto the his disciples and to
[1:05:49] how he must go into Jerusalem and suffer
[1:05:52] many things of the elders and the chief
[1:05:53] priests and scribes and be killed and to
[1:05:55] be raised up on the third
[1:05:58] day then Peter took him the man who has
[1:06:01] a
[1:06:02] revelation the man
[1:06:06] who has the
[1:06:08] keys he's got an understanding and Jesus
[1:06:11] is telling them these things are
[1:06:13] necessary that they be fulfilled this is
[1:06:16] the way it has to be done there's a
[1:06:20] death it's not
[1:06:22] pretty um
[1:06:24] I've got to be delivered it may look
[1:06:27] like failure but it's victory and here's
[1:06:31] a man with a revelation of who Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ
[1:06:37] is admonishing the Lord far be it from
[1:06:41] thee
[1:06:42] Lord this shall not be unto
[1:06:45] thee but he turned and said unto Peter
[1:06:48] get thee behind me
[1:06:50] Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for th
[1:06:54] thou savest not the things that be of
[1:06:56] God but those things that are of
[1:06:59] men we could tell ourselves that every
[1:07:02] morning
[1:07:03] amen your worst enemy is yourself when
[1:07:07] you Savor the things of men more than
[1:07:10] the things of God you have necessity
[1:07:13] that you die you have necessity that you
[1:07:16] get behind me Satan that's the challenge
[1:07:19] that we have to daily come to no one's
[1:07:23] above it
[1:07:24] we've got to Die daily we want the
[1:07:26] victory in the camp we want Jesus Christ
[1:07:29] to have a liberty we need to come having
[1:07:31] died the death we need to come oh Lord I
[1:07:34] need you on the scene I don't want to
[1:07:37] see flesh in my brother I want to see
[1:07:39] Jesus Christ there's needs in the body
[1:07:41] there's sickness there's the need of
[1:07:43] Salvation there I'm seeing the world
[1:07:45] creeping in Lord I Want Your Presence to
[1:07:48] meet us there I want the conviction of
[1:07:50] the Holy Spirit to be so present that
[1:07:52] when people come in the back doors they
[1:07:54] notice there's an atmosphere different
[1:07:56] why these people conduct themselves
[1:07:57] different in the sanctuary there's a
[1:07:59] reverence what is it almighty God meets
[1:08:01] people there the presence of the most
[1:08:04] high is in the midst there's a people
[1:08:07] with a reverence that understand the
[1:08:09] power of God's word they don't move
[1:08:10] around when the word's being
[1:08:13] spoken and we do I'm not saying that as
[1:08:15] correction we do so what's our
[1:08:17] expectation when you fulfill all these
[1:08:19] things is that God's going to move we
[1:08:22] are the people of the promise
[1:08:24] he he he didn't do all of these things
[1:08:30] um and not think about his own his
[1:08:33] promise was that he that you know he
[1:08:35] says he who doesn't provide for his own
[1:08:37] is worse than an Infidel right he he's
[1:08:40] not going to suffer that any of you
[1:08:42] are are left hungry or weak but if you
[1:08:46] don't trust him if you're not willing to
[1:08:48] die out if you're not willing
[1:08:50] to take what may be the harder way
[1:08:54] then you're not going to get to be able
[1:08:55] to reign with him you're not going to be
[1:08:57] able to participate in the benefits the
[1:08:59] way that he's promised I don't want just
[1:09:02] a general outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:04] I want a perfecting of my character I
[1:09:06] want to reign with him I want to rule
[1:09:08] with him I want the nature that Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ
[1:09:11] had and uh this is in contending for the
[1:09:14] faith as it preached back in 55 it's
[1:09:18] just a short paragraph now then the
[1:09:20] first one to introduce the message of
[1:09:23] Faith which be our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:25] John just introduced the Lord Jesus and
[1:09:28] Jesus was the product of what God
[1:09:30] intended for us to contend for for he
[1:09:32] was the whole of the Christian faith
[1:09:34] laid in Jesus Christ and our faith in
[1:09:37] him now if we can only understand what
[1:09:39] kind of Faith he taught what kind of
[1:09:41] Faith he PR practiced then we would see
[1:09:45] that if the early church practiced the
[1:09:47] same thing then we should earnestly
[1:09:49] contend for that type of faith for it's
[1:09:51] the commission to us to continue hold
[1:09:54] until he
[1:09:55] comes
[1:09:57] amen let's go ahead and just stand so
[1:10:00] that musicians would
[1:10:12] come you know what's next in the path
[1:10:15] you've
[1:10:19] chosen if you're
[1:10:21] running from God if
[1:10:26] you are a son of God you should be
[1:10:28] prepared to be
[1:10:30] apprehended because he's going to seek
[1:10:32] and save those which are
[1:10:34] lost if you're if you're holding on to a
[1:10:37] promise and you're believing God then
[1:10:40] expect for
[1:10:42] that to be manifested and if your faith
[1:10:45] has received it then you're going to
[1:10:47] testify and if you're testifying then
[1:10:49] your testimony is going to
[1:10:52] multiply right so the expectation is
[1:10:54] that God's word's going to accomplish
[1:10:56] that what it's sent for that he's going
[1:10:58] to
[1:10:59] perform exactly what he promised it
[1:11:01] would
[1:11:02] perform and that regardless of the
[1:11:07] condition God's word's greater and
[1:11:10] that's the reality that we're going to
[1:11:11] contend
[1:11:14] for say just play something we'll just
[1:11:16] bow our heads and go to him gracious
[1:11:19] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:11:21] promises for your word Lord It's it's
[1:11:23] only by your spirit that we could obtain
[1:11:25] these things lord it's not in of
[1:11:27] ourselves
[1:11:28] there's nothing that we've obtained but
[1:11:31] faith is a gift of you Lord unless you
[1:11:33] come and you open our eyes Lord we'll
[1:11:36] just see ourselves surrounded by an
[1:11:38] enemy we'll feel that we're outnumbered
[1:11:39] and Lord there's no hope it'll just look
[1:11:42] like death as the young Widow would say
[1:11:45] that she was going to just take a little
[1:11:47] bit of meal and take it to the
[1:11:51] pot make a bread piece pie of bread that
[1:11:55] her and her son could eat it and die yet
[1:11:58] there's a prophet standing there and in
[1:12:01] obedience to that voice Lord it was life
[1:12:03] to her and her family Lord I believe
[1:12:06] this message is your provided way Lord
[1:12:09] it ministered life to me as a Young Man
[1:12:12] Lord and you're the same yesterday today
[1:12:14] and forever lord it's
[1:12:17] not to be intellectually stimulated or
[1:12:20] puffed up father but that lives would be
[1:12:22] changed by a touch for from you Lord and
[1:12:25] you're faithful to look out over your
[1:12:26] word Lord there's needs that are
[1:12:29] represented here I think of my brother
[1:12:30] John Lord testifying to your healing
[1:12:34] touch standing before your people Lord
[1:12:36] and we know the hour of Deliverance and
[1:12:38] manifestation near Lord You're the same
[1:12:42] Lord
[1:12:43] You're the provider of every good gift
[1:12:46] that's all been paid for at Calvary it's
[1:12:48] in you Lord we want to do our part to
[1:12:51] testify to take our stand to be
[1:12:53] identified with you Lord and when we've
[1:12:56] done all the stand Lord May there be
[1:12:58] that time where you come in the power of
[1:13:00] your spirit Lord Lord dry every tear and
[1:13:03] Lord may it be a time of rejoicing in
[1:13:05] you Lord May the victory that you've
[1:13:09] provided be manifested here on Earth as
[1:13:11] it is in heaven Lord just a little while
[1:13:13] longer this this vanity of this
[1:13:17] life those things which are that are not
[1:13:20] they'll fade away and as we were meant
[1:13:22] to be we'll be there with you Lord in
[1:13:25] well bodies with sound Minds father but
[1:13:28] you told us to pray on Earth as it is in
[1:13:31] heaven Lord we ask that the temporal
[1:13:33] manifestation would be manifested father
[1:13:36] Lord sure may we may get sick again Lord
[1:13:38] but this is the victory you've purchased
[1:13:40] for your people you said that you would
[1:13:42] that we' prosper and be in good health
[1:13:44] Lord we ask that our faith would rise up
[1:13:47] oh God and Lord that you would just
[1:13:49] touch Us by your spirit may we know that
[1:13:51] your promises are for us
[1:13:54] Lord and as you would come and you would
[1:13:56] deal with each heart and we'd be found
[1:13:58] in your presence Lord may we understand
[1:14:00] that your love is not changing that it
[1:14:02] doesn't fail you're
[1:14:04] not slack concerning your promises Lord
[1:14:08] that if we could be in your divine
[1:14:09] presence at at any time if we have ever
[1:14:12] been in your presence Lord then that
[1:14:15] provided place is present now Lord we
[1:14:19] may have think that our standings
[1:14:21] changed Lord but that place was provided
[1:14:23] by the shed blood of Calvary Lord and
[1:14:26] every person that would long to have a
[1:14:29] refreshing from you Lord I ask that you
[1:14:31] would come Lord may your presence move
