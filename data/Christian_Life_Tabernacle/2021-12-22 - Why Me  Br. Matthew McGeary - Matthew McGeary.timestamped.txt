[39:29] your heart
[39:30] and in your life and it would bear forth
[39:32] the fruits
[39:33] of the word and
[39:35] as we're just approaching this uh
[39:37] christmas time this christmas season
[39:39] where god so loved the world that he
[39:41] gave his only begotten son that
[39:43] whosoever should believeth in him should
[39:45] not perish
[39:46] but have everlasting life i'm so
[39:48] thankful that i'm a recipient
[39:50] of this great love that god has loved us

[39:54] great gift that god has given let's just
[39:57] go before him in prayer heavenly father
[39:59] how we love you tonight
[40:00] we're so thankful for your grace and
[40:03] your mercy
[40:04] and your love lord the greatest love
[40:06] gift that was ever given to mankind
[40:10] came wrapped
[40:12] in swaddling cloth in a
[40:14] little old manger only fit for
[40:18] animals not fit for a king but
[40:21] lord you humbled yourself
[40:24] and you came to be one of us that you
[40:26] could be the high priest that's touched
[40:28] by the feeling of our infirmities lord
[40:30] so we're encouraged tonight to know
[40:33] or do you know what we're going through
[40:34] you know the pain and you know the
[40:35] suffering you know the sorrows and
[40:38] you're mindful lord and it's that very
[40:40] gift that you gave of your life that if

[40:44] sacrifice tonight that we could be
[40:45] forgiven of our sins and we can receive
[40:48] the joy lord for you said who the son is
[40:51] made free is free indeed lord we're
[40:53] thankful tonight that we're a free
[40:55] people that we can come and worship you

[41:00] surrender ourselves and ask that you
[41:01] would come and break the bread of life
[41:03] now as only you can we love you we thank
[41:05] you for each one that's gathered each
[41:07] one that's not able to make it lord we
[41:08] commit them to you now in jesus christ's
[41:11] name we pray
[41:12] amen praise the lord
[41:15] if you have your bibles we'll be reading
[41:16] out of matthew chapter two
[41:19] i mean it's good to be in the house of
[41:20] god tonight
[41:23] amen it's
[41:25] it's it's wonderful to have brother
[41:27] burley with us but it's not wonderful
[41:29] that he's out there
[41:30] and not up here
[41:32] but you know i'm thankful that brother
[41:34] burley's had a chance to have a little
[41:36] rest and spend time with his family
[41:38] and so we just really appreciate uh
[41:40] brother burley and and the short times
[41:42] that i've had with him i've certainly
[41:44] learned from him uh with his words of
[41:46] wisdom and i i look up to him he's a a
[41:48] wonderful brother and minister of the
[41:50] gospel so we're just thankful to have
[41:52] him and his family that's been with us
[41:53] we're just reading out of matthew
[41:55] chapter two
[41:56] um we'll just start with verse one it
[41:59] says now when jesus was born in
[42:01] bethlehem of judea
[42:03] in the days of herod the king behold
[42:05] there came wise men from the east to
[42:08] jerusalem
[42:10] saying where is he that is born king of
[42:13] the jews
[42:14] for we have seen his star in the east
[42:17] and are come
[42:18] to worship him
[42:20] i really like that portion of scripture
[42:21] says for we have seen his star in the
[42:23] east and we have come to worship him
[42:25] they didn't come to worship the star
[42:28] a lot of people want to worship the star
[42:29] they want to see the wonders in the
[42:31] heavens and they they see some big great
[42:33] happening but but i'm not interested in
[42:35] worshiping the star i'm not interested
[42:36] in worshiping the messenger but i'm
[42:38] wanting to to worship what the messenger
[42:40] introduced i want to i want to worship
[42:43] what the star was introducing and that
[42:45] was the birth of the lord jesus christ
[42:48] amen and it goes on to say when herod
[42:51] the king had heard these things he was
[42:53] troubled
[42:54] and all jerusalem with him and when he
[42:56] had gathered all of the chief priests
[42:59] and scribes of the people together he
[43:00] demanded of them where christ
[43:03] should be born
[43:06] and they said unto him in bethlehem
[43:09] of judea for thus it is written by the
[43:13] prophet now i don't want to preach while
[43:15] you're standing but it's amazing here
[43:17] that these magis have seen the star and
[43:19] had come to worship him and here's all
[43:21] these theologians and all these people
[43:24] who are educated in the word and and the
[43:26] king would even gather him all together
[43:28] and say hey oh where is the king going
[43:30] to be born and they would all say well
[43:31] he's going to be born in bethlehem but
[43:33] right in their midst they were
[43:35] completely blind to the word being
[43:37] manifested in their midst amen because
[43:40] god comes in simplicity
[43:42] he says and and they said unto him in
[43:45] bethlehem of judea for thus it is
[43:47] written by the prophet and thou
[43:49] bethlehem and the land of judah are not
[43:52] the least among the princes of judah for
[43:56] out of these shall come a governor that
[43:58] shall rule my people israel amen you may
[44:00] have your seats
[44:03] just because of the season i i
[44:05] i just like to keep reading a little bit
[44:07] because this portion of scripture is
[44:08] just so wonderful it might be a little
[44:11] bit different type of service
[44:13] maybe you are usually used to hearing me
[44:16] be a little bit more evangelistical but
[44:18] i don't know if i can not be that but
[44:20] we're maybe going to have a little
[44:21] different uh
[44:22] approach this evening by his grace but
[44:25] if we keep reading there
[44:26] it says
[44:29] and he sent them to bethlehem and said
[44:31] go and search diligently for the young
[44:33] child and when you have found him bring
[44:35] word again that i may come and worship
[44:37] him also when they had heard the king
[44:40] they departed and lo the star which they
[44:42] saw in the east went before them till it
[44:45] came and stood over where the young
[44:47] child
[44:48] was
[44:50] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[44:52] with exceeding great joy
[44:55] and when they were coming to the house
[44:57] they saw the young child
[44:59] with mary his mother
[45:01] and fell down
[45:02] and worshiped him and when they had
[45:04] opened their treasures and presented
[45:06] unto him gifts of gold frankincense and
[45:08] myrrh and and being warned of god in a
[45:11] dream that they should not return to
[45:12] herod they departed into their own
[45:15] country
[45:16] and went another way
[45:18] amen
[45:21] my we could just we could just keep
[45:22] reading the scripture
[45:24] it's such a beautiful
[45:26] portion of scripture here but i just
[45:28] wanted to read this text here because
[45:30] the prophet of god would preach a
[45:31] message called why little bethlehem
[45:34] and you know if the prophet of god is
[45:36] asking a question or he's phrasing the
[45:39] question
[45:40] why little bethlehem then
[45:42] when the question goes forth something
[45:44] in your heart or in your mind you want
[45:46] to ask the question to yourself
[45:49] why little bethlehem because as you
[45:51] would ponder upon that and start to
[45:53] wonder well why is the prophet asking me
[45:56] why little bethlehem it's because he's
[45:59] going to give you an answer but in the
[46:01] question he's he's trying to to help
[46:03] your minds and help you in a way to to
[46:06] have a certain approach to the scripture
[46:08] so you can start to wonder well why is
[46:10] he even asking the question many times
[46:13] we look into the bible and we take
[46:14] things uh just for granted or or we read
[46:18] over it and we've heard it so many times
[46:20] that if we're not careful we don't
[46:21] actually catch the meaning or the heart
[46:23] meaning or or the purpose or the intent
[46:26] what god is doing when he's doing
[46:28] something so why little bethlehem the
[46:30] prophet of god is asking the question
[46:32] why little bethlehem so in preaching
[46:34] this sermon now he's he's wanting to
[46:37] have you start to take that question in
[46:39] your heart and now he's going to
[46:41] approach the word a certain way and give
[46:43] you the answer
[46:44] why little bethlehem so when the prophet
[46:47] of god would preach why it had to be
[46:49] shepherds well it's just not because oh
[46:51] well well because it says there in the
[46:54] bible that there was there was angels
[46:56] that appeared unto the shepherds god
[46:57] doesn't just do things uh for no reason
[47:00] but god has a purpose in doing it and
[47:02] god has a way in doing it when god does
[47:04] something one way he does it that way
[47:06] every time so if we can catch the
[47:08] revelation behind the word and what the
[47:10] prophet is trying to bring to you why
[47:12] little bethlehem all of a sudden it'll
[47:14] start to unlock a revelation and the
[47:16] scripture will start start to unlock
[47:18] something and your understanding you'll
[47:19] start to see that pattern now unfolding
[47:22] down through the scriptures and down
[47:23] through the word so we want to catch the
[47:25] mind of god behind the question
[47:28] why little bethlehem
[47:30] why it had to be shepherds and i want to
[47:33] title
[47:34] my sermon this evening why
[47:36] me
[47:38] why me typically when you would ask the
[47:40] question why me you know uh uh generally
[47:43] maybe you're you're dealing with
[47:45] something uh maybe some hardship or some
[47:48] trial or or something might be a
[47:51] difficult or you don't see your way
[47:53] through something and so you might ask
[47:55] the question how many have been going
[47:57] through a hard time or going through a
[47:59] hard trial and it just don't seem like
[48:01] things are working out and so you might
[48:03] ask the question why me
[48:06] i'm the only one
[48:09] well i can i can preach to myself
[48:11] tonight that's all right because i've
[48:13] sat there before and i've asked the
[48:15] question why me
[48:17] and this question maybe i could say it's
[48:19] twofold we can we can look at it two
[48:22] different ways by the help of god but
[48:24] but many times we we make decisions and
[48:27] and we wonder why did i do that or why
[48:30] me or why am i having such a hard time
[48:32] with this and maybe you look at other
[48:34] people's lives and if we're not careful
[48:35] we start to compare ourselves one to
[48:37] another and we start to wonder well why
[48:39] me and and many times you know a god has
[48:43] called us to different walks in life and
[48:44] different families and we come different
[48:46] ways and if we're not careful we start
[48:49] weighing our wealth with the things of
[48:51] the world and say well my family we live
[48:53] in a little apartment over here and we
[48:54] don't have a little much and then you
[48:56] start to get discouraged and satan
[48:58] starts to heap it up on you and you
[48:59] start to measure the success in your
[49:01] life and you start to measure where
[49:03] you're at with life and you start to
[49:04] measure your spirituality by looking at
[49:07] maybe the carnal things around you you
[49:08] start to wonder why am i like this why
[49:10] did i have to come this way why do i
[49:12] have to have this hardship why do i have
[49:14] to have this type of oppression
[49:16] why did i have to come this way why
[49:18] couldn't i come this way like this other
[49:20] brother oh because
[49:22] why me well there's an answer
[49:24] the spirit of god is wanting you to ask
[49:26] the question and i believe somebody here
[49:29] has asked the question in your heart
[49:31] you've asked why me and now the spirit
[49:34] of god is wanting to come to you and
[49:36] he's wanting to answer the question so
[49:38] if you can just catch the mind of god
[49:39] tonight and how he's going to walk you
[49:41] through the word you'll catch the
[49:42] revelation of why you
[49:46] why you
[49:50] we want to catch the mind of god now
[49:51] watch this
[49:53] the prophet of god would say we have
[49:55] seen his star and i've come to worship
[49:57] him
[49:59] and when god
[50:00] in any way that he desires to do it
[50:02] reveals to you the question that's in
[50:04] your mind
[50:06] there's no more doubt
[50:07] there's no more question about it it's a
[50:10] revelation
[50:11] and so you've been asking the question
[50:13] in your heart why me you've been asking
[50:16] why you've been going through you've
[50:17] been asking why you're in this season in
[50:19] your life and so if there's a question
[50:21] in your heart now god is coming to you
[50:24] he's going to answer the question in
[50:26] such a way it becomes a revelation to
[50:28] you that you know where you're standing
[50:30] you know why you're in the season you're
[50:32] in you know why you're going through the
[50:33] trials you're going through because god
[50:36] has chosen you you say why me god has a
[50:38] specific work that he wants to do in
[50:40] your life
[50:43] oh you might not be able to understand
[50:45] it
[50:48] but remember when god reveals to you the
[50:50] question in your mind
[50:52] there's no more question it's a
[50:54] revelation
[50:57] i think of paul how he sought the lord
[50:59] three times for this infirmity
[51:01] he said lord i would that this infirmity
[51:04] would depart for me and he prayed over
[51:06] and over how many have prayed for an
[51:08] infirmity that you would you would want
[51:10] to be delivered of and for some reason
[51:12] it just seems like it lingers there but
[51:14] i like now that this is not making a way
[51:17] for you not to stand on the promise of
[51:19] god if you're believing for healing you
[51:20] keep believing for healing you keep
[51:22] taking god's word you keep believing for
[51:25] the promised word that god has given you
[51:27] but in the midst of the trial come on
[51:29] somebody in the midst of going through
[51:31] it and while you're going through this
[51:33] trial and why you're going through this
[51:35] situation
[51:36] you can say like paul would say uh that
[51:39] that lord i sought you three times but
[51:41] god spoke back to him there in second
[51:43] corinthians 12 of verse eight and said
[51:45] unto me my grace is sufficient for thee
[51:48] i want to tell you god's grace is
[51:50] sufficient for you tonight he said my
[51:52] strength is made perfect in weakness
[51:55] most gladly will i rather glory in my
[51:58] infirmity hallelujah oh my there should
[52:00] be some people if you got a little
[52:02] infirmity in your life why don't you
[52:04] just go ahead and start glorying in that
[52:06] infirmity and start praising god and
[52:09] giving god glory for paul said that the
[52:12] power of christ might rest upon me oh
[52:15] that i might glory and my infirmity god
[52:18] help me when i'm going through the hard
[52:20] times when i'm going through the trial
[52:22] when i have the infirmity when it seems
[52:24] like i'm down and out that i can have
[52:26] this revelation where i'm saying lord
[52:28] why me why am i going through these
[52:30] things why does it seem so tough why
[52:32] does it seem so high but i can kick
[52:34] right back at that devil and give him a
[52:36] black eye say oh i'm going to glory unto
[52:39] my god and mind infirmity and the things
[52:42] that i'm going through because my god
[52:44] he's more than able to deliver me he is
[52:46] my healer he is my comforter he is my
[52:49] guide he is my redeemer i'm going to
[52:52] praise him i'm going to rejoice i'm
[52:54] going to give him praise and in that
[52:56] infirmity you just go ahead and start
[52:58] praising the lord
[53:00] that the power of god
[53:02] might rest upon you
[53:04] and that in your weakness
[53:06] he will be made strong
[53:09] therefore i take pleasure in mind
[53:10] infirmity oh listen to this oh if
[53:13] there's a question god has a revelation
[53:15] for you tonight therefore i take
[53:17] pleasure in infirmities
[53:19] how many take pleasure and infirmities
[53:22] oh god i need a revelation tonight
[53:26] god give us a little revelation because
[53:27] i tell you i hate the breaks you've
[53:29] heard it a few times it ain't getting
[53:30] easier
[53:32] everybody's uh wanting uh uh all these
[53:35] plagues and viruses and everything to go
[53:38] go away and it looks like we're we're
[53:39] just getting back to norm and all sudden
[53:42] knock knock who's there
[53:44] omnicron
[53:46] omnicron who omnicron i didn't go away
[53:50] right
[53:52] oh you know it's just getting warmed up
[53:54] out there
[53:55] this is what you want to call pre-trib
[53:57] stuff as some would quote it
[53:59] this is just pretty this is nothing
[54:01] compared to what's coming down the pipe
[54:04] oh no
[54:05] you just you might as well dig into the
[54:07] word you might as well come into christ
[54:09] come and do where you're safe it ain't
[54:11] time to be playing around it's going to
[54:13] get a lot worse out there you think it's
[54:14] getting better no
[54:16] things are just getting warmed up
[54:19] oh what kind of doomsday messages
[54:20] christmas message is this brother
[54:22] matthew well it is a christmas message
[54:24] because with the onslaught of the devil
[54:27] and satan's eden god has given the
[54:29] greatest gift that he's ever given his
[54:31] son jesus christ that you would be
[54:34] identified with a sacrifice and you
[54:36] would apply the blood to your life and
[54:38] you could run into that shelter and be
[54:40] saved from the oncoming judgment that's
[54:42] what this message has come for it's come
[54:44] to deliver a people from the oncoming
[54:46] judgment i say that judgment has already
[54:49] come and that's what's striking the
[54:51] world today you're seeing the judgments
[54:53] for rejecting the grace of god
[54:56] therefore will i take pleasure in
[54:58] infirmities
[55:00] well we didn't even get past that one
[55:01] did we
[55:05] now i haven't had too many conversations
[55:07] you know brother andrew i just want to
[55:09] tell you man
[55:11] i mean i've just been taking a lot of
[55:12] pleasure in this infirmity i got
[55:15] i just wanted to tell you about it man
[55:17] this little this little pain i got going
[55:19] on i'll tell you man this thing it's
[55:20] really brought me to my knees and
[55:21] brought me closer to the lord
[55:24] oh
[55:25] oh maybe that ought to be the outlook
[55:28] maybe maybe that'll be the way to start
[55:30] approaching it because i don't know
[55:31] about you when i get desperate when i
[55:34] get in pain many people want to run to
[55:36] the medicine cabinet you want to run to
[55:38] the doctor you want to run the ladies
[55:40] see you but why don't we run to christ
[55:42] why don't we get down on our knees and
[55:43] take a scripture like this and say lord
[55:45] jesus i'm in pain right now but i'm
[55:48] going to take pleasure in my infirmity
[55:50] because it's drawing me closer to you
[55:52] that the power of god might rest upon me
[55:55] that in my weakness oh god you are made
[55:58] strong
[55:59] oh hallelujah therefore i will take
[56:01] pleasure in mine infirmities and
[56:04] reproaches and necessities and
[56:06] persecutions in distress for christ's
[56:09] sake for when i am weak hallelujah
[56:13] then i am strong oh i look out into the
[56:16] world you see all the gloom and doom and
[56:18] the death
[56:19] and everything that's going on i tell
[56:21] you life can be cruel it can be very
[56:23] hard and those things that you love and
[56:25] hold dear to you as you would grow and
[56:27] you would get older it seems like those
[56:29] that are close they start to die or move
[56:31] away or or your mom and your dad your
[56:34] uncles and then those closest to you and
[56:36] tragedy strikes a home and it just seems
[56:38] like uh it seems like life can be so
[56:41] cruel and you look out there to the
[56:42] world where the scripture right here
[56:44] would say when i am weak but to them
[56:46] there's nothing after that
[56:48] they're just weak
[56:50] there's no hope
[56:51] there's no even hope of a resurrection
[56:53] there's no life after death because when
[56:55] i'm weak i'm really weak
[56:58] and when i'm weak i'm even weaker but oh
[57:00] a saints of god tonight oh why me in
[57:04] your distress in your infirmity in your
[57:06] weakness you can say for when i am weak
[57:11] then i am strong
[57:13] oh why little bethlehem
[57:17] the prophet of god would say god does
[57:19] things in unusual ways
[57:21] and god is so great
[57:24] till he takes the unidentified things of
[57:27] the earth
[57:28] to identify himself by it
[57:31] i want to maybe focus on that for a
[57:33] little bit now as
[57:36] god is so great till he takes
[57:39] the unidentified things of the earth
[57:43] to identify himself by it so in our
[57:46] scripture here in our text as we would
[57:47] read verse 6 it says in thou bethlehem
[57:51] in the land of judah are not the least
[57:54] among the princes of judah
[57:56] for out of thee
[57:58] remember now god is so great till he
[58:00] takes
[58:01] something that's unidentified
[58:04] something that doesn't have any identity
[58:06] and god wants to go ahead and take that
[58:09] this something that seems insignificant
[58:12] something that's unrecognized something
[58:14] that's unrecognized by the world
[58:16] something that's unrecognized by the
[58:17] church world something that might be
[58:19] unrecognized by the age that seems like
[58:21] it has no identification but what god
[58:23] wants to do he wants to go ahead and
[58:25] take that individual he wants to go
[58:27] ahead and take that place and what he
[58:29] wants to do is he want to take that
[58:31] thing that is unidentified
[58:33] and that seems insignificant and he
[58:35] wants to identify himself by it
[58:38] oh i don't know about you but i could
[58:40] preach a little writer right there
[58:41] because that gets me excited
[58:43] that that gets me happy because i
[58:45] realize what the plan of god is for my
[58:48] life and what he wants to do in each one
[58:50] of us we ain't some big somebody we
[58:52] ain't got something to offer we're not
[58:54] some big church we're not some big
[58:56] program we didn't make ourselves nothing
[58:58] but what has happened in this age god
[59:01] has come by his grace and his mercy has
[59:03] come the capstone crying grace grace and
[59:06] he has taken a people that is
[59:08] unidentified that seems insignificant
[59:11] but he has taken them because he wants
[59:13] to identify himself by his pride in the
[59:15] end time
[59:17] thank you jesus
[59:20] because out of these shall come a
[59:21] governor that shall rule my people
[59:24] israel
[59:25] and just continuing on and why little
[59:27] bethlehem he says our minds cannot
[59:29] fathom
[59:32] how great he is
[59:37] and yet when he gets ready to reveal
[59:39] himself
[59:41] he makes it so simple
[59:44] takes the simple things to do it
[59:48] the simplicity of it
[59:50] zechariah 4 10 would say for who hath
[59:53] despised the day of small things
[59:57] what is that that's god hiding himself
[59:59] in simplicity
[1:00:01] the prophet of god would pick that up in
[1:00:02] the breach after preaching a god hiding
[1:00:05] himself in simplicity he would take this
[1:00:07] scripture and say for whoever despise
[1:00:09] the smaller things small things that's
[1:00:11] god in simplicity god in simplicity in
[1:00:15] here the greatest climax of the seventh
[1:00:18] angels message ministry wasn't uh going
[1:00:21] around the world it wasn't in a venue of
[1:00:23] ten thousand or a hundred thousand
[1:00:26] people but it was in a little
[1:00:27] constructed building in a little mud bed
[1:00:30] there in jeffersonville indiana where
[1:00:32] the revelation of the seven seals would
[1:00:34] start to break forth god hiding himself
[1:00:38] in simplicity god taking something that
[1:00:40] was unrecognized something that was
[1:00:43] insignificant where people would look
[1:00:45] out across the landscape and they'd see
[1:00:47] a little mud bed and wonder what in the
[1:00:49] world could that ever be worth something
[1:00:51] that was unidentified but yet god had
[1:00:54] great plans for that plot of land
[1:00:56] because it was going to be in that place
[1:00:58] where the sounding of the seventh
[1:01:00] angel's message went forth revealing the
[1:01:02] seven seals to the bride of jesus christ
[1:01:07] oh god taking something that seems so
[1:01:09] insignificant
[1:01:11] but he wanted to identify himself by it
[1:01:14] for who has despised the day of small
[1:01:16] things look while we're walking through
[1:01:18] this just start getting ready to put
[1:01:19] yourself in the word
[1:01:21] we ain't giving a history lesson here
[1:01:25] why little bethlehem
[1:01:26] it's not well why why did god choose
[1:01:29] little bethlehem 2000 years ago but god
[1:01:32] is wanting you to catch a revelation why
[1:01:34] me
[1:01:36] why me there's something here for the
[1:01:37] bride of jesus christ to catch a
[1:01:39] revelation of
[1:01:41] for who has despised the day of small
[1:01:43] things
[1:01:45] why little bethlehem
[1:01:47] and when
[1:01:48] god would rent the kingdom
[1:01:50] from saul
[1:01:52] he would tell samuel all right now
[1:01:54] i want you to go on down to bethlehem
[1:01:58] and i want you to go down to the house
[1:02:01] of jesse
[1:02:03] for i have chosen myself a king but but
[1:02:06] listen to me now samuel
[1:02:08] i i don't want you to look on his
[1:02:10] countenance
[1:02:12] i don't want you to look at his height
[1:02:14] and his stature
[1:02:16] and his build and and how good looking
[1:02:18] he is
[1:02:19] because that's what man does
[1:02:21] man looks on the outside but you see
[1:02:24] samuel i've actually chosen a king and i
[1:02:27] haven't chosen this king by the ways of
[1:02:29] man
[1:02:30] it's not going to be uh like saul who
[1:02:32] was who was head and shoulders uh taller
[1:02:35] than everybody else but i want you to go
[1:02:38] on down there and i'll tell you which
[1:02:39] one it is
[1:02:41] so here the prophet of god would go on
[1:02:43] down and samuel would come to the house
[1:02:45] of jesse and say hey i've come here to
[1:02:48] anoint one of your son's king and he's
[1:02:49] like all right well
[1:02:51] i know who that's going to be
[1:02:53] that would be my firstborn
[1:02:55] and he brings his firstborn son in there
[1:02:57] and here he stands before the prophet
[1:03:00] and by you could just imagine jesse
[1:03:02] thinking my
[1:03:03] to think the prophet of god has come
[1:03:05] down to my house to to anoint my son my
[1:03:08] firstborn look at him doesn't he look
[1:03:09] stately
[1:03:11] doesn't you know look look at how he's
[1:03:13] he's he's he presents himself well
[1:03:16] doesn't he doesn't he profit you know he
[1:03:18] he knows how to carry himself and and he
[1:03:20] looks pretty good don't he's like no
[1:03:22] that ain't him
[1:03:24] oh all right well i bring my second son
[1:03:27] you know he's he's been a blessing he he
[1:03:29] really works hard and you know he's
[1:03:31] really tried to to keep up with his
[1:03:32] brother and he he he's about the same
[1:03:34] height and the same building he really
[1:03:36] knows how to carry himself he's the one
[1:03:38] right nope
[1:03:40] and all of a sudden one
[1:03:42] after one
[1:03:44] after another after seven sons
[1:03:48] now think of this
[1:03:51] i mean the daddy basically said these
[1:03:53] are the seven sons i got
[1:03:55] that i mean should be out of these seven
[1:03:59] one of these should do prophet
[1:04:02] and the prophet had to look at jesse and
[1:04:04] say have you got one more
[1:04:06] now think of it
[1:04:08] think of it the prophet had to look and
[1:04:09] say hey do you got one more you you
[1:04:11] would think that that that jesse after
[1:04:14] going through seven as we just
[1:04:15] dramatized a little bit would say well
[1:04:17] if them seven didn't work hold on real
[1:04:19] quick i actually got one more
[1:04:22] but no even jesse himself was like what
[1:04:24] do you mean these are my seven eldest i
[1:04:27] mean one of these gotta work and the
[1:04:29] prophet looked at him said no i'm
[1:04:31] telling you you must got another one
[1:04:33] because none of these are written jesse
[1:04:35] looked back at the prophecy well
[1:04:38] i mean we i do got one more son
[1:04:42] he ain't much to look at
[1:04:44] you know so much so he's just you know
[1:04:45] he's just a little ruddy kid we just
[1:04:47] kind of keep them out there on the
[1:04:48] hillside you know keeping after the
[1:04:51] sheep and everything
[1:04:52] i mean he's not much to look at but
[1:04:55] you you want me to call him yeah that's
[1:04:57] why i'm here to annoy the king
[1:05:00] okay so they go in and they bring david
[1:05:03] on over to david comes in and then the
[1:05:05] prophet of god takes one look at david
[1:05:08] and he says that's him that's him and he
[1:05:10] anoints his head with oil
[1:05:14] and there david
[1:05:16] why david
[1:05:18] why bethlehem
[1:05:20] why little ruddy david
[1:05:26] the prophet of god would say
[1:05:30] well i've got
[1:05:32] one more perhaps but he wouldn't be
[1:05:34] nothing
[1:05:35] he's just a little dried up sort of
[1:05:38] fellow
[1:05:39] we got him out there hurting sheep he
[1:05:41] said go get him
[1:05:43] and as soon as he fell in the eyes of as
[1:05:47] soon as he fell in the eyes of the
[1:05:49] anointed prophet he poured the oil upon
[1:05:52] his head and run to meet him and said
[1:05:55] this
[1:05:56] is the one god chose
[1:06:00] see it's not tinsel always of the world
[1:06:04] it's god's choosing
[1:06:07] now focus on that for a little bit it's
[1:06:09] not the tinsel it's not the outward
[1:06:11] appearance it's not the works it's not
[1:06:13] what you can do for god but it's god's
[1:06:16] choosing why little ruddy david why
[1:06:18] little bethlehem the smallest of the
[1:06:21] cities a little judah because why it's
[1:06:24] god's choosing that's why it's the place
[1:06:27] that god had chose to bring his word to
[1:06:29] manifestation
[1:06:31] that's why little bethlehem that's why
[1:06:33] little david because it was god's
[1:06:35] choosing god had a purpose god had a
[1:06:38] design god had a word he had something
[1:06:40] that he was unfolding and if you would
[1:06:42] ask the question why little bethlehem
[1:06:45] why david because it was god's choosing
[1:06:49] now remember we're working towards a
[1:06:51] thought this evening why me
[1:06:57] micah 5 2 would say but thou bethlehem
[1:07:01] ephrata
[1:07:03] though thou be little among thousands
[1:07:07] of judah
[1:07:09] yet out of thee shall come forth unto me
[1:07:13] that to be a ruler
[1:07:15] in israel
[1:07:16] look there was no other place
[1:07:20] that christ could be born but where the
[1:07:23] word had prophesied the word to come
[1:07:26] forth
[1:07:27] you follow me there was no other place
[1:07:29] for that word for the word of the lord
[1:07:31] comes to the prophet and the prophet had
[1:07:34] spoken but bethlehem infertil although
[1:07:37] thou be little amongst those in judah oh
[1:07:40] the littlest city but out of thee
[1:07:44] so that king that ruler that governor
[1:07:46] had to come out
[1:07:49] of that house
[1:07:52] now i want you to think of this
[1:07:54] so there was no other place for that
[1:07:56] word to be born
[1:07:59] and so now here uh mary is a spouse to
[1:08:02] joseph
[1:08:04] and now she's with child and she's nine
[1:08:06] months pregnant
[1:08:08] and now they're going to have to now the
[1:08:10] the king has made a decree in a taxation
[1:08:13] where everybody has to return back to
[1:08:15] their homeland because they have to go
[1:08:17] back
[1:08:18] and partake in this tax now you could
[1:08:21] imagine joseph and mary being there nine
[1:08:23] months pregnant could you imagine the
[1:08:25] why me
[1:08:26] if anybody had a why me like joseph
[1:08:29] i'm nine months pregnant
[1:08:31] that is a five six day journey
[1:08:34] back to your home can't we just stay
[1:08:36] here
[1:08:37] and i think what's so wonderful is this
[1:08:40] is this this government mandate that
[1:08:42] seemed to be such a heavy taxation on
[1:08:45] the people was actually an instrument
[1:08:47] that god was using to get his children
[1:08:50] in position to fulfill the word of the
[1:08:53] hour oh my think of that saints of god
[1:08:56] the very laws that were going forth the
[1:08:58] very mandates that were being made here
[1:09:01] the devil thought he was doing something
[1:09:03] in his satani by trying to bring on the
[1:09:06] pressure trying to make it worse and
[1:09:08] make it worse but the only thing he was
[1:09:10] doing was fulfilling prophecy and he can
[1:09:13] bring it on satan can bring all he wants
[1:09:15] he can throw every fire and every shot
[1:09:17] at this bride he can try to drown you
[1:09:20] out and put you out and put you down but
[1:09:22] the only thing he is doing is making
[1:09:24] your character shine like gold because
[1:09:27] the character that's on the inside of
[1:09:29] the bride of jesus christ is none other
[1:09:32] than the lord jesus christ himself so
[1:09:34] let the trials come oh i can glory and
[1:09:37] mine infirmity i can glory in mine
[1:09:40] affliction hallelujah why because
[1:09:42] there's a character of gold there's
[1:09:44] jesus christ on the inside that's coming
[1:09:47] on the outside
[1:09:49] oh hallelujah well sometimes we don't
[1:09:52] know how not to get excited
[1:09:54] but praise god for his word
[1:09:57] this government mandate
[1:10:00] this taxation
[1:10:01] and here
[1:10:02] mary's wondering why me
[1:10:05] joseph we got to make this journey back
[1:10:07] through
[1:10:08] uh all the way back to bethlehem yes
[1:10:12] yes honey we better get going
[1:10:14] everybody's moving that way it's going
[1:10:15] to be real dangerous uh people are are
[1:10:17] all traversing back and you know out
[1:10:20] there that the robbers and the thieves
[1:10:21] and certain ones we want to try to get
[1:10:23] out there in the mix of everything
[1:10:25] because you know maybe a good samaritan
[1:10:26] will come by in case we need a little
[1:10:28] bit of help let's let's get going and so
[1:10:30] here they go
[1:10:34] nine months pregnant
[1:10:36] on a donkey
[1:10:38] going through rough rugged terrain
[1:10:43] five six day journey
[1:10:46] boy i can hear it right now
[1:10:49] why me
[1:10:52] i don't think any of us maybe some of
[1:10:53] you have but
[1:10:56] that sounds like a hard trial right
[1:10:58] there for mary now
[1:10:59] as her and uh mary and joseph
[1:11:02] are heading out that way and they're
[1:11:04] they're coming in they're getting closer
[1:11:07] and closer and now think about this here
[1:11:09] mary she's been impregnated with the
[1:11:11] word and now she's under this government
[1:11:14] mandate and maybe they're just having
[1:11:16] this conversation and she's saying
[1:11:17] joseph i don't think i can make it
[1:11:21] i don't i don't think i can make it i
[1:11:23] don't think i'm gonna be able to make it
[1:11:24] back and and you can see joseph being a
[1:11:26] lovely honey well honey if we can just
[1:11:28] make it there if we could just get get
[1:11:30] to my hometown i know there's people
[1:11:32] there that can help we try to make you
[1:11:34] comfortable uh we we can try at least
[1:11:36] get a little help for you and as she
[1:11:37] keeps going along and she keeps saying
[1:11:40] oh i don't think i can make it i wonder
[1:11:42] if there's somebody here this evening
[1:11:43] that you feel like you know what i don't
[1:11:45] know if i can make it i don't think i'm
[1:11:48] gonna make it if anybody felt like they
[1:11:50] weren't gonna be able to make it i can
[1:11:51] imagine mary as she was there on that
[1:11:54] donkey and every little bounce and every
[1:11:56] little motion and every little move she
[1:11:58] just felt like there was no way her body
[1:12:01] was just throwing fits on her she didn't
[1:12:03] know if she was gonna lose her own life
[1:12:04] maybe she didn't know all the mind
[1:12:06] battles going through your head and just
[1:12:07] wondering what's really happening to me
[1:12:09] why is this what god had in his mind
[1:12:12] for me to bring forth emmanuel
[1:12:15] is this really what god had in store for
[1:12:17] my life lord you called me you elected
[1:12:19] me you chose me i don't know if i'm
[1:12:20] going to be able to make it
[1:12:23] i got good news for you
[1:12:26] because mary had been impregnated with
[1:12:28] the word
[1:12:30] and mary didn't have a choice if she was
[1:12:32] going to make it or not because there
[1:12:34] was only one place that that word could
[1:12:36] be birthed and it was in bethlehem and i
[1:12:39] want to tell you pride of jesus christ
[1:12:41] you've been impregnated with the word of
[1:12:43] god and you keep wondering if you're
[1:12:45] going to make it i want to tell you
[1:12:46] you're going to make it because you will
[1:12:48] bring forth the fruit of this word
[1:12:51] because you've been predestinated to do
[1:12:53] it you are the chosen place that god has
[1:12:56] chosen in the end time to bring this
[1:12:58] prophesied word by malachi 4 5 into
[1:13:01] manifestation it's by the bride of jesus
[1:13:03] christ that's sitting right here in
[1:13:06] bedford maybe we can ask the question
[1:13:08] tonight why little bedford
[1:13:11] because god has called a people
[1:13:14] god has ordained a people to receive the
[1:13:17] message of the hour and to be
[1:13:19] impregnated by the word of god and to
[1:13:21] bring it into full manifestation
[1:13:25] why me
[1:13:27] i don't think i can make it
[1:13:29] don't worry mary you ain't got a choice
[1:13:31] there's only one place that son could be
[1:13:33] born
[1:13:36] that's in bethlehem
[1:13:38] why because i chose bethlehem
[1:13:41] and i'll make sure to let you get there
[1:13:44] oh you wonder if you don't worry god has
[1:13:46] predestinated you he's elected you you
[1:13:49] are now seated in heavenly places in
[1:13:51] christ jesus oh my so much so the
[1:13:54] blessed is the man whom the lord will
[1:13:56] not impute sin oh you can't miss it you
[1:13:59] can't fail you can't fall
[1:14:01] you've been predestinated to make it
[1:14:05] thou art least among the princes of
[1:14:07] judah
[1:14:09] but out of these shall come a governor
[1:14:11] that shall rule my people
[1:14:14] the prophet of god would say in this
[1:14:16] little town
[1:14:18] this little
[1:14:20] stable
[1:14:22] city stable down on the side of the
[1:14:23] bluff was a cave back in the bluff
[1:14:27] and out of there
[1:14:28] came forth
[1:14:29] through its little doors
[1:14:32] the prince of peace
[1:14:34] born in a stable
[1:14:37] and a little box of straw sitting
[1:14:39] somewhere
[1:14:41] manure piled up in the barns and so
[1:14:43] forth
[1:14:45] but out of there came the great prince
[1:14:48] the seed of the woman
[1:14:51] out of there came the savior
[1:14:54] of the world
[1:14:55] out of there came jehovah
[1:14:58] himself in the form
[1:15:00] of a man
[1:15:02] came out of that little humble stable in
[1:15:04] bethlehem
[1:15:06] not in some king's palace
[1:15:08] born in royalty
[1:15:11] but he came from that humble place
[1:15:14] to a manure stack down in there
[1:15:17] and was wrapped in swaddling cloth
[1:15:21] you asked the question why me
[1:15:24] because out of thee
[1:15:27] why me because out of thee god
[1:15:30] is wanting to manifest his word
[1:15:33] why me abraham could ask the same
[1:15:35] question
[1:15:36] here in genesis chapter 12 you find that
[1:15:39] that god called abraham
[1:15:42] and god made an unconditional covenant
[1:15:44] with abraham
[1:15:46] and he said abraham i want you to look
[1:15:48] at the sand
[1:15:50] of the sea
[1:15:53] can you number it now i want you to look
[1:15:54] at the stars
[1:15:57] in the heavens
[1:15:58] and he said so shall thy seed be
[1:16:02] god had made an unconditional covenant
[1:16:05] with abraham abraham could have asked
[1:16:07] the question why me
[1:16:09] because it was god's choosing god chose
[1:16:12] abraham and made an unconditional
[1:16:16] covenant with abraham and told him that
[1:16:19] i will make your seed as the sand of the
[1:16:22] sea and as the stars of the heavens so
[1:16:24] shall thy seed be
[1:16:28] oh my
[1:16:30] i tell you what
[1:16:32] it seemed like it was a cakewalk now
[1:16:35] abraham could have thought well i got
[1:16:36] this
[1:16:37] almighty god has come down and and made
[1:16:40] an unconditional covenant with me
[1:16:43] so it just seems like now that i got it
[1:16:46] on easy street
[1:16:48] no no abraham
[1:16:50] didn't quite work like that
[1:16:53] the journey got hard for abraham
[1:16:57] it got real tough for him
[1:16:59] and it and it even it even got down to a
[1:17:02] place
[1:17:03] where abraham
[1:17:05] would say how lord how can i be a father
[1:17:07] of nations seeing that i go childless
[1:17:10] and he had already made a mistake once
[1:17:12] or twice even more because he was trying
[1:17:15] in himself to bring forth a promise but
[1:17:18] but in abraham's ability he had nothing
[1:17:21] in himself that he could bring forth the
[1:17:22] promise but always abraham could say
[1:17:24] lord i know you made the promise
[1:17:30] the journey wasn't easy for abraham i
[1:17:32] don't know about some of you but maybe
[1:17:33] the journey hasn't been easy for you
[1:17:37] and abraham got down to that place where
[1:17:39] they were getting old in age and and
[1:17:41] they were getting discouraged and now
[1:17:43] here here a little unrecognized
[1:17:46] insignificant sarah now her womb has
[1:17:48] dried up and the milk veins have dried
[1:17:50] up in here abraham is seeing all how can
[1:17:53] i even bring forth this promised son
[1:17:57] oh but i love god's word because god
[1:18:00] came down
[1:18:02] god came down that great melchizedek
[1:18:04] come down to confirm his promise
[1:18:07] and he came walking out there on the
[1:18:09] planes of memory and there abraham stood
[1:18:11] in the door and he recognized it was the
[1:18:13] lord but you know when melchizedek came
[1:18:16] who was he looking for
[1:18:18] he walked up to the tent door he wasn't
[1:18:20] looking for abraham
[1:18:22] he said where is thy wife
[1:18:24] sarah see god had come down and made a
[1:18:28] visitation to abraham who he made an
[1:18:30] unconditional promise with and he said
[1:18:32] look i have come down he said where is
[1:18:34] your where is your wife sarah she said
[1:18:37] she's in the tent
[1:18:38] and he said according to the time of
[1:18:40] life you shall have a son by your wife
[1:18:44] sarah
[1:18:45] or even sarah in her own self said who
[1:18:49] me
[1:18:50] have pleasure with my lord even in the
[1:18:52] doubt in sarah's own mind even in her
[1:18:55] own ability she knew within herself oh
[1:18:58] how could i bring forth a promised son
[1:19:01] in my condition
[1:19:02] oh god is speaking to somebody tonight
[1:19:04] maybe you feel like you're past the time
[1:19:06] you're past the season but god has come
[1:19:09] down to confirm his covenant and said
[1:19:12] out of these terror out of you my bride
[1:19:15] according to the time of life you shall
[1:19:17] bring forth the promised word that i
[1:19:19] have given to
[1:19:20] you oh hallelujah and sarah she seemed
[1:19:24] maybe a little unrecognized she seemed
[1:19:27] unsignificant but that word that
[1:19:30] promised word that unconditional
[1:19:31] covenant started to have an effect it
[1:19:34] started to have a change on sarah's body
[1:19:36] oh i want to tell you a bride of jesus
[1:19:38] christ this message is having an effect
[1:19:40] on you
[1:19:41] it is changing your very body you it
[1:19:44] might not look like it but i tell you
[1:19:46] just keep holding on keep holding on to
[1:19:49] every promised word that god has given
[1:19:51] you because one step by one step in a
[1:19:54] moment in a twinkling of an eye one day
[1:19:56] saints of god we're going to be changed
[1:19:58] once and for all
[1:20:00] oh glory to god why because out of thee
[1:20:05] why me
[1:20:07] yes the journey looks tough
[1:20:11] the journey looks hard but
[1:20:13] it might look impossible
[1:20:15] but first peter 2 9 would read like this
[1:20:17] but ye are a chosen generation
[1:20:21] a royal priesthood
[1:20:22] a holy nation
[1:20:25] a peculiar people that ye should show
[1:20:27] forth the praises of him who hath called
[1:20:29] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:20:32] light
[1:20:34] oh my does that identify somebody
[1:20:37] which in times past were not a people
[1:20:40] but are now the people of god which hath
[1:20:42] not obtained mercy but now
[1:20:45] have obtained mercy
[1:20:47] something that was
[1:20:49] unidentified
[1:20:52] god has chosen to identify himself by it
[1:20:57] is there somebody here that could say
[1:20:58] you know what
[1:21:00] little old insignificant me i was
[1:21:02] unidentified but god
[1:21:05] chose me to identify his love his grace
[1:21:09] his mercy
[1:21:11] oh my just as we just break now into the
[1:21:14] inspiration maybe
[1:21:16] of what's really on our heart here as i
[1:21:19] started to think upon these lines of
[1:21:21] something that is unidentified and maybe
[1:21:25] something
[1:21:26] that's unrecognized you know you might
[1:21:29] drive along the road or you might go out
[1:21:32] to some
[1:21:33] places on the the east coast and maybe
[1:21:36] go into the carolinas and and the
[1:21:38] virginias and places like that and you
[1:21:41] might see a historical marker
[1:21:44] and you know there the historical marker
[1:21:47] is there because it's marking a place of
[1:21:50] some type of significant event
[1:21:53] so maybe a place that would seem
[1:21:56] unrecognized or would seem insignificant
[1:21:59] but as you would pull up there you would
[1:22:01] start to read this historical marker and
[1:22:04] you'd realize that some famous battle or
[1:22:06] some civil war battle or something that
[1:22:08] took in place right upon these grounds
[1:22:11] and you can maybe just start to in your
[1:22:12] mind to think my uh this calvary must
[1:22:15] have come over this region and something
[1:22:17] that seemed insignificant
[1:22:19] something that was unrecognized is now
[1:22:21] has something that's identifying that
[1:22:24] place a historical marker is letting you
[1:22:27] know that something of significance
[1:22:29] happened in this place
[1:22:32] and as i thought about these things i
[1:22:35] went in my mind and i was there standing
[1:22:37] on the
[1:22:38] the the coast in the countryside there
[1:22:41] in my mind there in san diego and am i
[1:22:44] if you were to stand there close to the
[1:22:46] ocean and the the waves would start to
[1:22:49] to wash in there and and you would look
[1:22:51] off of the cliffsides and and maybe
[1:22:53] it'll be 150 200 feet uh dropping down
[1:22:56] to the shore and and the ground would
[1:22:58] just kind of roll over and and maybe
[1:23:00] roll down and you could walk down and
[1:23:02] there's the the coastal cypress and the
[1:23:04] cedar trees and and this land it's just
[1:23:07] it's just beautiful but maybe compared
[1:23:09] to the vast countryside and the vast
[1:23:13] coastal lands and and all over the world
[1:23:16] this little this little portion of land
[1:23:18] in san diego would just maybe seem so
[1:23:21] insignificant
[1:23:23] it would be so unrecognized if you were
[1:23:25] to maybe go back in time and you were to
[1:23:27] stand there maybe some two uh 300 years
[1:23:30] ago
[1:23:31] but now if you were to go and you were
[1:23:33] to stand in that same spot there in rose
[1:23:36] crane san diego and you'd look upon that
[1:23:39] same landscape now it's it's no longer
[1:23:42] unmarked but it's marked by cross
[1:23:45] after cross and thousands upon thousands
[1:23:49] of cross of men who laid down their
[1:23:52] lives in combat and for freedom and you
[1:23:55] could just look one after another and
[1:23:58] hear this countryside that once was
[1:24:00] unrecognized it seemed insignificant but
[1:24:04] now it's marked by thousands upon
[1:24:06] thousands of graves of men who laid down
[1:24:09] their lives on the sacrifice of freedom
[1:24:12] and oh you could just go into the
[1:24:13] history and you could read about this
[1:24:15] young man who was there and got a medal
[1:24:18] of honor and he was in battle only 20
[1:24:20] years old and a grenade came over into
[1:24:23] the camp and he jumped upon that grenade
[1:24:26] and he he won a medal of honor because
[1:24:28] he preserved so 15 or 20 more lives of
[1:24:31] his comrade because of self-sacrifice
[1:24:34] and here on this landscape
[1:24:36] which was unrecognized and insignificant
[1:24:40] are over a hundred thousand graves of
[1:24:43] men and women that have gave their life
[1:24:48] something that was unrecognized
[1:24:51] something
[1:24:53] that was insignificant
[1:24:55] but now
[1:24:56] it's made significant
[1:24:59] it's now identified because there's
[1:25:02] lives after lives that have been laid
[1:25:05] down and now each cross that is laying
[1:25:08] there thousands upon thousands now mark
[1:25:11] a a a hillside that was once
[1:25:14] unidentified now it's become identified
[1:25:17] and i can't help in my heart to think
[1:25:20] states there was once a hill that was
[1:25:22] unidentified it wasn't marked it seemed
[1:25:26] insignificant nobody would have thought
[1:25:28] anything about that hill and here the
[1:25:31] lord of glory was there in the garden of
[1:25:34] gethsemane with the weight of the world
[1:25:36] upon his shoulders and he was in agony
[1:25:39] he was crying sweats of blood that were
[1:25:41] crying down his face our lord wouldn't
[1:25:43] say why me because he knew who he was
[1:25:47] but he would say oh god
[1:25:51] if possible
[1:25:53] but lord
[1:25:56] nevertheless my will
[1:25:59] but thy
[1:26:01] there
[1:26:03] may be a hill that
[1:26:05] no one would have ever remembered
[1:26:08] no one would have ever thought twice
[1:26:10] about
[1:26:11] they led the lord of glory up there
[1:26:14] and on that hill
[1:26:16] called gilgatha
[1:26:18] they nailed our lord
[1:26:20] and our savior the most precious gift
[1:26:23] that was ever given to mankind hung
[1:26:26] there on that cross for your sin for my
[1:26:30] sin he was bruised he was beaten and
[1:26:34] there on that cross
[1:26:36] your sins was nailed there
[1:26:40] and there
[1:26:41] became the greatest historical marker
[1:26:44] that the world has ever known the cross
[1:26:47] of calvary that our lord jesus christ
[1:26:50] spread forth his arms and said it is
[1:26:53] finished
[1:26:57] oh hallelujah it was the chosen place
[1:27:02] a hill that was insignificant
[1:27:06] that was unrecognized
[1:27:09] god had chose to fulfill his word
[1:27:13] and forgive mankind for their sins
[1:27:17] i think of job
[1:27:20] job
[1:27:22] went through such great trial
[1:27:25] such great agony
[1:27:29] and there little did job know that satan
[1:27:32] had made his way around to the lord and
[1:27:34] said
[1:27:35] where have you been up to say i've just
[1:27:37] been going to and fro seeking who i may
[1:27:39] devour
[1:27:41] and god said have you considered my
[1:27:42] servant job
[1:27:44] well yeah i put a little hedge around
[1:27:46] them
[1:27:46] you put a little hedge around to protect
[1:27:48] them how can i get at them you put a
[1:27:50] little hedge around them all right i'll
[1:27:51] take it away
[1:27:54] job
[1:27:55] not even realizing maybe not even privy
[1:27:58] to what was starting to happen to him
[1:28:01] now all of a sudden his life starts to
[1:28:02] unravel
[1:28:03] his life starts to fall apart he starts
[1:28:06] to lose all of his lively stock he
[1:28:08] starts to lose all of his financial gain
[1:28:10] everything that he's built up all of his
[1:28:12] life savings everything that he's worked
[1:28:14] so hard for it seems like everything's
[1:28:17] been taken away from him oh my i wonder
[1:28:19] if somebody's ever gone through that you
[1:28:21] worked so hard you saved all your money
[1:28:23] and something comes your way and you're
[1:28:25] asking yourself why me lord why am i
[1:28:27] going through this it just seems like i
[1:28:28] can't make ends meet and just one thing
[1:28:31] after another after another where it
[1:28:33] came down to the place and now that job
[1:28:35] and his seven children now even they had
[1:28:38] been slain under under a winds and under
[1:28:40] the building when they were gathered and
[1:28:41] now job is on the ash heap
[1:28:45] job is so discouraged
[1:28:47] job might be asking the question why me
[1:28:51] why me lord
[1:28:53] why am i going through this
[1:28:56] he was so discouraged he would start to
[1:28:57] even curse the day that he was born
[1:29:01] oh just blotted out from the history
[1:29:03] books
[1:29:04] why why would
[1:29:05] why would i even even come into this
[1:29:07] world if this was going to be the agony
[1:29:10] if this was going to be the pain if this
[1:29:12] was going to be the suffering if this is
[1:29:14] what i was going to have to go through
[1:29:16] why would i even be born why me lord
[1:29:22] if there's a question upon your heart
[1:29:24] there's an answer
[1:29:28] if in your heart you're wondering why
[1:29:30] you're going through the things that
[1:29:31] you're going through and here even joe
[1:29:32] you think job didn't have any questions
[1:29:36] oh my look i'm sure the greatest battle
[1:29:39] ever fought was in the mind didn't start
[1:29:40] in ladiesea
[1:29:43] chardon in the garden of eden
[1:29:45] started there with eve straight way back
[1:29:47] there before time even began
[1:29:50] and no doubt job is on the ashy he's
[1:29:53] going through this mind battle i wonder
[1:29:54] why even me lord what did i do and
[1:29:56] they're oh you're a secret sinner joe
[1:29:58] this is why you're going through all
[1:29:59] these things
[1:30:01] but little little did job know
[1:30:03] that god had chosen job
[1:30:07] god had put an attribute god had put a
[1:30:09] revelation in job hallelujah
[1:30:12] there was something inside of job that
[1:30:15] in the midst of the trial in the midst
[1:30:17] of the anguish in the midst of the agony
[1:30:20] there was going to come forth a
[1:30:21] revelation that would come forth out of
[1:30:24] job's mouth and he would say i know my
[1:30:27] redeemer liveth and in the last days
[1:30:29] he'll stand upon the earth and though
[1:30:31] the skin worms destroy this body yet in
[1:30:34] my flesh i shall see god
[1:30:36] oh hallelujah was in that trial it was
[1:30:39] in that time it was in that questioning
[1:30:42] that this great revelation broke to that
[1:30:44] prophet job and he spoke those notable
[1:30:46] words
[1:30:49] and you know it's from that revelation
[1:30:51] of job
[1:30:53] that abraham
[1:30:55] he would buy a parcel of land for sarah
[1:30:59] abraham would be buried there
[1:31:02] isaac would be buried there
[1:31:04] and jacob would go down into egypt and
[1:31:06] he said look i tell you what children
[1:31:10] there ain't no resurrection down here in
[1:31:12] egypt
[1:31:13] oh but up there in that promised land
[1:31:16] i'm telling you once was insignificant
[1:31:19] it was was unmarked but god had called
[1:31:21] our father abraham and he said get you
[1:31:23] out of that sick country that you're in
[1:31:26] and i'm going to show you forth a
[1:31:27] country that i'm going to give to you
[1:31:29] and once there was a land that was
[1:31:31] unrecognized it seemed insignificant but
[1:31:33] god had given them a divine promise that
[1:31:36] it was the promised land
[1:31:39] and there jacob's down there and he just
[1:31:40] said
[1:31:41] look boys
[1:31:44] take my bones
[1:31:45] out of here
[1:31:46] there ain't no resurrection in egypt
[1:31:49] the resurrection's in palestine take my
[1:31:52] bones with you joseph when he would die
[1:31:54] and the children of israel he'd tell her
[1:31:55] hey
[1:31:57] don't leave my bones down here because
[1:31:59] all of them prophets they had knew the
[1:32:01] word that had been spoken by job that i
[1:32:04] shall stand in my flesh and i shall see
[1:32:07] my redeemer there knew there was coming
[1:32:10] forth the first fruits of the
[1:32:11] resurrection and though our lord
[1:32:14] jesus christ hung there on calvary i'm
[1:32:16] so glad that's not the end of the story
[1:32:19] because there was some unrecognized
[1:32:22] insignificant tomb that they just so
[1:32:24] happened to lay our lord in
[1:32:29] some insignificant unmarked stone was
[1:32:32] rolled in front of it
[1:32:34] oh hallelujah but on the third day
[1:32:38] the stone was rolled away
[1:32:40] and that insignificant unrecognized tomb
[1:32:44] with some unrecognized stone became the
[1:32:46] greatest recognized tomb that has ever
[1:32:49] been on the face of the world because
[1:32:51] out of that tomb came i resurrected lord
[1:32:54] jesus christ and with him all of those
[1:32:57] saints of old and the first fruits of
[1:32:59] the resurrection they came up with him
[1:33:02] why me job because you're going to bring
[1:33:04] forth a revelation and a prophecy and by
[1:33:07] that everyone after you is going to know
[1:33:10] bury me here because i know that i shall
[1:33:12] see my redeemer
[1:33:14] and i want to tell you tonight friends
[1:33:16] if you have not been buried in jesus
[1:33:19] christ there's only one place for you to
[1:33:21] go tonight is to be buried in jesus
[1:33:24] christ and in the word the greatest gift
[1:33:26] that has ever been given to man
[1:33:30] don't bury me and lady will see you
[1:33:31] don't bury me in the traditions of man
[1:33:34] don't bury me in creeks and dogs don't
[1:33:36] bury me with some message of theology
[1:33:38] and fanaticism bury me in the lord jesus
[1:33:41] christ and his word and if you bury me
[1:33:43] in there i know i'll come up in the
[1:33:46] resurrection
[1:33:47] oh
[1:33:48] hallelujah glory
[1:33:52] hallelujah
[1:33:53] oh my if the musicians would come
[1:33:56] oh praise his wonderful name
[1:33:59] hallelujah
[1:34:01] oh my
[1:34:06] oh my
[1:34:09] there was a room
[1:34:12] it was unrecognized
[1:34:15] it was insignificant
[1:34:19] but the lord told those disciples
[1:34:23] go tarry ye in jerusalem
[1:34:26] go into that upper room and tarry there
[1:34:29] until you be
[1:34:30] endued with power
[1:34:33] from on high
[1:34:35] and no they waited there for the promise
[1:34:38] and all of a sudden there came a rushing
[1:34:40] mighty wind
[1:34:41] that swept into the pillar into the room
[1:34:44] and like tons of fire started to break
[1:34:46] up and settle down upon the people
[1:34:50] just an unrecognized
[1:34:53] insignificant room
[1:34:56] maybe you've asked the question in your
[1:34:58] heart why me
[1:35:01] maybe you felt that way so many times
[1:35:09] now we find out why little bethlehem
[1:35:12] paragraph 69
[1:35:15] now we find out this little stable
[1:35:19] it was there that the first noel
[1:35:22] was ever saying on earth
[1:35:25] let's all stand
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:34] and it was saying by angels
[1:35:37] think of it
[1:35:38] the first noel
[1:35:41] sung up there with caiaphas
[1:35:44] not down at some great fine church
[1:35:48] where a wonderful pastor was
[1:35:51] but at a stable in bethlehem
[1:35:55] the least among all of them
[1:35:59] but the first noel was saying by angelic
[1:36:03] beings in that little city of bethlehem
[1:36:05] see what i mean
[1:36:07] no matter how poor you are
[1:36:11] how little or insignificant you might be
[1:36:15] god can use you
[1:36:17] if you'll just let him do so
[1:36:20] god wants you
[1:36:24] now i want to end right here because
[1:36:26] it's the christmas season
[1:36:31] and many times we
[1:36:33] reach out to one another one's in our
[1:36:35] family
[1:36:36] and we say what can i get you for
[1:36:38] christmas
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:40] you know and it can be a trying time you
[1:36:42] know it can be a puzzle you could just
[1:36:44] wonder
[1:36:45] what in the world can i get them
[1:36:48] but you know when you finally
[1:36:50] when you finally get a good answer and
[1:36:52] it seems like yeah that's nice you know
[1:36:53] you're excited right because you're like
[1:36:54] you know what
[1:36:56] i'd like to get that for him
[1:36:58] you know we just read a quote where
[1:37:02] forgive me for
[1:37:04] might sound sacrilegious but
[1:37:07] that's like god's wish list
[1:37:10] he says if you'll just let him do it god
[1:37:12] wants you
[1:37:15] oh they asked the question like i said
[1:37:17] it might sound sacrilegious but
[1:37:18] what do you want for christmas you know
[1:37:20] the only thing god wants
[1:37:22] is you
[1:37:25] and maybe you haven't surrendered your
[1:37:27] heart
[1:37:28] and here this christmas season you've
[1:37:30] been saying i want this and i want that
[1:37:33] and hear the lord of glory
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:37] who took an unrecognized hill
[1:37:40] and placed the greatest landmark the
[1:37:42] world has ever seen
[1:37:44] by the cross of calvary
[1:37:47] and he gave his life that
[1:37:49] self-sacrifice that you could be set
[1:37:51] free and delivered
[1:37:53] and he stands here tonight telling you
[1:37:55] all i want is you
[1:37:58] you can take the whole world
[1:38:00] everything else could go but i want your
[1:38:02] heart

[1:38:22] surrender to the call and you'd want to
[1:38:24] lift their hand up and say lord i want
[1:38:26] to give you my heart

[1:38:46] long suffering and patience and
