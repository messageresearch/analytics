want to welcome everyone in the house of God and amen all our visitors will certainly welcome you amen I trust you're happy to be gathered here this morning amen uh I want to continue to remember our pastor like I said and sister Genie and and all the other requests that we put in let's open our Bibles this morning um uh Romans chapter 7 a very familiar scripture reading I just want to speak on Thanksgiving for a little bit um I know that uh you know the people are already buying the turkeys and getting everything ready and you know you don't want to go on Friday because all the turkeys will be gone and the checkout line will be very long so um uh they I believe they announced that there's no service on Wednesday so uh we don't have service on Wednesday so uh Romans chapter 7 um verse one it says know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which has a husband is bound by law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of the husband so then if while her husband liveth she is married to another she shall be called an adulteress but if the husband be dead she's free from the law so that she's not adulteress adulteress though she be married to another wherefore my brethren ye also are become Dead from the law by the body of of of Christ that you should not be married you should that you should be married to another even to him who raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruits unto God for it says for when we were in flesh the Motions of sins which were which were by the by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law and being dead where where wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit not in the oldness of the latter I love that amen let's also turn in Psalm 107 verse1 Psalm 107 verse1 it says oh give thanks unto the Lord for his goodness for his mercy endureth forever let the redeem of the Lord say so whom he had redeemed from the hands of the enemy and gather them out of the land from the East and from the west from the north and from the south I believe that scripture is very applicable this morning they wandered in Wilderness in solitary way they found no City to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fended in them then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and they delivered them out of the distress Lord and they LED them forth by the right by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation oh that men should would praise the Lord for his goodness for his wonderful works for the children of men let's just bow our heads gracious father we ask that you bless your word to us this morning we're commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you may have your seats just want to speak for a moment and my title is a message of Thanksgiving a message of Thanksgiving I I I was studying from uh the message butam preach uh the invisible Union and uh I if you ever get a chance to listen in that message if and I'm pretty sure you have uh it's just one of those that uh you you can never get tired of listening too and and every time you listen the Lord is continually speaking to us and and I was listening to it and brother ram calls it his message of Thanksgiving and I just thought about you know if this morning we were to be thankful what exactly are we thankful for you know I I thought when we think about Thanksgiving no doubt is a day and the season to be thankful and when you are thankful uh one of the first thing you do is you you have to bring things in remembrance you have to to to uh bring things in remembrance of what is it that you are thankful about and we can look at our natural uh life and our flesh as we are this morning and I believe each one can be certainly uh uh recognize what they are thankful for um one of the things in my life I always do as a habit is uh every once in a while it's important important you know the devil tried to get us into a situation where we're constantly fighting right you you are constantly in a war this comes up you got to win this battle you got to go take care of this you got to go take care of that and you really never get a time to just sit still and and and and and think about where you at you know I believe bam will say it in the way that you will always uh a man has always had the effit of looking at God what he done in the past and continually looking forward for what to come and never really taking the time to look at what God is doing in the present and that's human nature we look at ourselves we can recognize that and I'll say this even we can certainly look at ourselves and if we are honest with ourselves this morning you can look at yourself and say that in the flesh this morning as you sit here somebody helped you to be where you are today you you didn't get there by yourself and I'm talking about in the flesh you can realize that uh perhaps along the way way you needed help somewhere you were in trouble you got in trouble somewhere somebody came and hand you a hand and you something went wrong you were hungry somebody fed you whether it be your parents or whoever that is and somebody came to your rescue you came to a place you had a a a tire that broke a car that broke down or you were in an accident somebody stepped in and come and help you so you when you sit you look along the way you will see that somebody was always there to help you and and it was there to come to your rescue no matter what you were going through and and and we have to be thankful for that we have to recognize that we didn't get out here because of Our Own Strength because of our own ability that we did so well you we educated ourselves and we did this that's what we are even even as far as work is concerned I remember I was just working and uh I I I I started off I was trying to get a certain position and and and I couldn't get it and I was working just as a technician and and somebody one day just walked in and and they asked me and I what what is it that you like I said oh I would love to do this and this and that position was not there they were offering me something else that would take me away from church and and I and I and I turned it down and and and and and then this guy just came by out of nowhere he said well for some reason I would like to take this position that's over there would like to create it so we have somebody who can do the same thing and out of nowhere something just came along and what was it it was God looking out for you naturally uh perhaps you were in a circumstance where the doctors has already spoken and say this is not going to happen you you know your situation we're looking at it it looks like it's bad and everything and and and and and I'm saying this is even while we were yet in sin I'm not talking about while we Sav and all of the sudden they said well let's do another skin and let's do another and they come and said well it's no longer there we're no longer going to go with the process that we thought we were going to do who was it somebody was looking out for you oh I tell you if you really pay careful attention we have so much to be thankful about and in the in the spiritual said remember we live by dead substance it says that if you have a life today somebody died for you somebody sacrificed for you somebody had to lay down the life so you could have life so just like in the natural somebody sacrifice so you could be here your parents they pay for your education or they pay for training or way for you to get a job somebody stepped in for you to have the car you have or whatever it is just understand that spiritually speaking you are sitting here not because of your own effort but somebody has been looking out for you oh we often time look for God and we say where is God where is God he's been walking along the way with you and you haven't even recognize him he's been there all the time and working out situations and healing you and walking with you and yet we are knocking doors and looking for him as yet is standing right by your side working every day and that's what I want us to just be uh mindful of is the Lord has never forgotten us has never for uh uh forsaken us he's always been there every time walking along it is spoken even on the message but will speak this message of Thanksgiving and he will quote out and he will say speak about the pilgrim forefathers and it said this history says that the pilgrim forefather are commonly associated with the first celebration of uh of Thanksgiving uh in America it says which was placed it was the first one was in uh 1621 uh 1621 and there was a group of English settlers who had journeyed to the new uh to the new world abro the Mayflower in search for Religious Freedom uh they didn't uh leave the land because they wanted more money they didn't leave because they needed more goods and more all all it that they wanted within their heart was to worship God the way that God was moving in their heart and I thought that's the heart of a True Believer we don't seek things because we want more money we want more this more all of it we want in life is to worship God in Freedom all is it that really bits within our heart is I don't care if it's about the job or this and this at the end of the day my decision is made because I want to get to a place where I can Worship the Lord in Freedom so they went to and then it says the pilgrims SE the the celebrated the first Thanksgiving after a successful Harvest as uh uh Plymouth massachusett and it says uh and the feast was a share with uh uh uh uh I looked it out but I forgot it was the Native American it's a tribe I for I can't say the name it says who helped them uh uh survive the first uh harsh winter because everything that they had brought just spoiled it when they get there they couldn't uh uh they didn't have anything they lost half of what they had so and then he says that the pilgrim they had a religious devotion the pilgrim were devout Christians they celebrate the celebration of Thanksgiving was deeply spiritual for them Thanksgiving was uh uh primarily about giving thanks to God for his provision or rather than a a national cultural celebration their Thanksgiving was marked by prayer worship and focus on God's blessing and faithfulness and I want to say this that's why when when we we can't celebrate Thanksgiving like the others are doing it we we have it's not about uh eating another way that you can cook your turkey you know I I don't know after 30 years how what's the other way that you can really cook the turkey there's only so many ways you can cook it you know what I mean you want it smoked you want it dipped in water brain you want it this you want it this that's never going to help you what we need is to come in recognition of what is God is doing spiritually is a Thanksgiving of what is it that we we as Christians how to be thankful about what is it as you're sitting here this morning what is it that you are really thankful about if you can really come in recognition of what's happening out there you'll be the most thankful person there on the face of the Earth if you can really come in realization that the world is falling apart if you can really come in recognition that there's nothing good out there if you can really come in understanding that the world is falling apart as fast as it can that I'm here Lord has open up my eyes so I can receive him and be saved from the destruction that has to make you the most helpful person there is it says and and and and the prophet will will and and and the prophet will speak here he uh uh and he will say he will say oh in the message I believe it's the same message I just quoted the invisible Union said I'm thankful to God to be living in the time on the closing scene of the world's history if you can put it up there it says I don't know it says if I would if I would have if if I would have a day uh say so before the foundation of the world and God would have laid out the whole program to me and said to me I want you to preach it says now what age would you desire to go on Earth and to preach preach it says I would choose this age for this is the Golden Age now it's amazing because if you go out there on the news they're saying that this is the Golden Age on the news today after the election they're calling this the golden age but yes's a prophet here already speaking about it if you go on the news you hear them talk about cat ladies and dog ladies the prophet has said it in this message is it a coincidence no if if we are not careful we get caught up in the intellect and this and this God is continually speaking his word to us every day it doesn't matter where you are let me say this God is speaking the question is are you listening because God is speaking he doesn't want you to get caught up in the political and the things that are were happening he wants you when you see the Pol iCal to go right back into his word and say that what is it that you're saying to me what time what Junction of time am I living in so I can hear your word and know what you're saying to me so he's saying that I want to live in this age because this is the Golden Age I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of his visit to the Earth but still I think this right now is the greatest time because it's time that is coming to take the people that is redeemed near nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth what a religious what a what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to the dying people great time we are unused about it it it let me say this everything that Jesus died for is culminating at the time that we are sitting here this morning this is the greatest time that is ever being what men Lost In the Garden of Eden God has restored what was in the beginning is here today the same voice of Resurrection the same voice that said let there be at in the beginning the same voice that look at Lazarus and say come forth the same voice has spoken to you in this end time not a different voice the same voice the same God with all his power and might and everything that he is God didn't want us to have a substitute God didn't want us to have a substandard message where we say well God spoke but that was just in that time oh God spoke but he was in the time of Jesus Christ he said that what he did with the Jews God promised that the Gentile will receive the same thing and he didn't send it in the first age not in the second age not in the third age he waited until you were here and he spoke so you can hear it let's not like brother uh uhh Paul was saying let's not be like that man that grew up at the ocean I get used to it no this is the Glorious age that's ever been this is the time that we have to be assured and know that I'm a Son of God because the word of God said so I me I heard the same voice of the Resurrection that spoke in the day of Lazarus I heard the same voice I said let there be I heard it with my own ears amen yes sir yet the devil is always there to try to make us stand and go if I could only have been in the time of Jesus on but about ask he says who's Jesus we we say Jesus and people automatically they have a 33y old man that's in a robe walking and touching people in say that Jesus the prophet said that if you meet someone with scars in his hand claiming to be Jesus he says that's an impostor Jesus Christ is the revealed word of the hour who was he he was the word of God reveal in that time and today is the same why because it's the revealed word for the time that you are living in remember it's never by sight it's never by what your eyes can see it's by Revelation those that knew him they knew knew him by Revelation and my brother my sister aren't you glad you know him by Revelation this morning that's right he he looked at Peter and said who do men say that I am he said well some say you are this why they were going by side oh some say you are this Prophet that a prophet they said but he said who do you say that I am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God in other words you are the anointed one for the hour and the prophet comes in this end time he said you are the anointed one for this hour that's what you have received and let me say this you didn't receive that so you can keep it in a closet you didn't receive that so you can keep it in the book you received it so you can walk out there and say I am the Son of [Music] God we dying with a very p in our hands sorry I just lost where I was it said it said paragraph 34 and I want you to really think this word is said and when we know that history is is closing out the world the world's history soon be over will soon be over then we are going to step into a new day to the great Millennium that as a Believer as as one believer I believe in in a millennium in a millennium reign with Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth the physical return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glor glorified by his cleansing blood I I tell you this th this is not time for compromising it it's not time to be looking out and trying to figure things out it's the time to dig into the word and be conscious of what we have received and let the word of God change your life for what God wants you to be this message didn't come so we can just quote it this message came with a power of transformation to make us into what God wants us to be and I want to say that let's not fall short and I know we know all this quotes we can read them we know all of this things but I just want us to understand this morning what is it that we are thankful for and let that that that which we are thankful for take an effect on us let it have an effect on us until we can produce the thing that he said that we should be promised and and he said this the scripture will say this in Deuteronomy 8 And1 it says oh beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God it says in not keeping his commandment and his judgment for his statue which I commanded thee this day it says let that thou lest when thou has eaten and are and are full and has build goodly houses and dwell wherein and when thy herd and thy flock multiply that silver and gold is multiply and all that has is multiply then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God don't don't be be caught up in riches and don't caught up oh because I can do this I have this I have this the the word of God is a constant warning to us it says don't be forgetful for the time that you are living in don't be forgetful of how you got here don't be forgetful of the work that the Lord is doing what the devil wants you always to do is always to concentrate in your inability in what you are trying to achieve and blur the whole program of God in front of you so you don't have the clear picture what the word is telling you is you didn't save yourself you didn't heal yourself you didn't make yourself what you are the one who brought you here is the one who's going to take you to the finish line Thank You Lord look the word of God is saying I it's him who starts the work is him who will finish it so don't jump the process if you have a need of something there's a word made available for you to take the word and overcome with it it's not for you to say oh I need this I need to go find this somewhere else did you get to where you were by yourself it it's the word providing a way for you to come out of what you are into what God wants you to be he says may I say this paragraph 192 it says what it says what this all's got to do with Thanksgiving it says what are you think what are you talking about brother brandham he says here it is quarter to9 I didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion yes it says the pilgrim for father we're very thankful for the new found way of life being separated from the old English denomination and Creed they could marry to a new anointed word for the rage and he says that's right the new anointed word for the age for the for their AG for their age so they receive what they were thankful about was they were not caught within that same old religion and and the same old things that never produce anything imagine going to church day in and day out and never get to receive anything imagine going to church day in and day out they preach you they preach you about Sin today they preach you about baptism tomorrow and the next day you come back to preach about again just imagine that's what's happening out there it's constantly oh you got to do this it's a 10 step to this you are not good enough and you are this and you got to work enough you got to work a lot more you you got to sacrifice this you got to do this you got to do this constantly under trying to figure out a way that you can please God imagine because that's what the old denomination is all about it's a process that's set up to just keep you turning in circles and never getting to anywhere imagine that but oh aren't you thankful you have received a message that's come when the world looks at you and call you a sinner the word of God calls you a Son of God when the world looks at you and they look at you you think you're crazy when this word of God looked at you in the situation that you were not now in the situation that you were in sin he looked at you and they called you a Son of God thank you Lord it said you are a son that's why you are not happy in the situation that you are in just come out you believe the word and you started coming out you believe the word that's why you are sitting here this morning let me say this this morning you probably have more faith than you think you have the reason is you let the knowledge in the things of the world fill your mind that's why you are struggling but if you let the same faith that got you out of the world the same faith that stop the things of the world that's God that's the faith that God wants to build upon we we start off by faith but then we try to add education on top I want to say this I'm thankful to be separated this morning amen I I'm thankful I I know we we we we are all a work in progress but I'm thankful that I can see the deception that's out there amen I'm thankful that God has opened up my eyes and has placed a desire in my heart that on the Sunday morning I should be in his house I'm thankful that I'm sitting here with those of light precious faith those who have been called out and we are here together worshiping the Lord I'm thankful for that and let me say this I'm thankful for Luke 17:30 I I'm thankful for Revelation 10:7 I'm thankful for the revealing of the son of man I'm thankful that God in this generation has made himself known to me personally I looked at it I saw the message as saw a man talking some looked at him and just call him a boy from Kentucky who couldn't put the sentence together but I listen to him I heard God talking I heard God calling I'm thankful this morning that when he stood there and you turn his back and he said you that are sitting over there and so and so they said God has healed you I'm thankful that somebody looked at it they said is reading the mind but I looked at it I said that's God that's the same hello him who stood before Abraham and I can stand here this morning and say that this scripture is fulfilled before your very [Applause] eyes I'm not talking about yesterday I'm talking today I'm talking right now don't put God in time God is not in time God is eternal I'm thankful for the opening of the seals why because he said within those divine revealing mystery he's quickening to you the faith for the Rapture in other word he's come to take you home he's here revealing himself to you so you can receive that word and be taken out of here let me say this don't lose focus of the purpose the word of God will not be a success if you're trying to apply it for the things of the world it's given to you to get you ready so you could be taken out here that's why I love what our Pastor said this is not a staying message it's a living message this message it's not about how much rich I can get in this world it's how quickly I can get out of here we can stand here this morning and say that I have heard God God spoke in this generation and be on the word of God the prophet will speak and he will say paragraph 20 195 it says Pentecost dried up like Luther and Wesley and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulling together said God's people in there yet has got to to come out to be out to be come out it says what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message yes sir notice that you notice that Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven churches were sealed with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't have they didn't live long enough it says but this blessed revelation of the seven seal it's opened to us in the last days from a prophecy from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona he says we have been and and I want to say this this has been given to us is so that we could be ready for what God has calling us to do this message is been given to us in order to get us ready first of all it's been given us to change us it's given us so we can get away from our thinking and our constant looking at ourselves and our failures and and constantly looking oh I'm not good enough and I can't do this I can't do that it's it's primarily sent so we can come in recognition and say that God is coming because remember it's in this message that is revealing your true origin he's letting you know where you really come from he's wanting to let you know that your origin is not your birth how you came from your parents and everything but your origin was that you were in God's mind before the foundation of the world but why is he telling you that he's giving you the word so you can be Overcomer in the generation that you are living in he giving you what you have need of in order for you to overcome the challenges you're facing he's giving you the world so you can stand toet to Toe with the devil it doesn't matter if it's in the form of sickness it doesn't matter it's in the form of depression it doesn't matter if it's a form of sin whatever form the devil shows up this morning God has given us the power and the authority to send there and bring forth the word of God and overcome him it it it's not given so we could just read now I I tell you I don't know about you but I like to see the word in action I I I don't know about you I I I I told the brothers I said I don't want to say if the message is true but I know it's true I want to see it in action I I I want to see it in AC I want to see the transformation working in our midst I want to see God's purpose being fulfilled it's not given so we can just take it and read it for one another all that no when one is sick we hear one is sick it's given to I can send there say it's by your stripes that th sisters heal and see stand up it's given when you meet one that's not saved you can speak to them remember says that this generation that they it says that the world will not see me no more but ye shall see me and the prophet will use that to say that this generation that the only form of Jesus Christ that they will ever see will be through you the only form that Jesus Christ let me say this you you you couldn't show me a promise in the Bible that it said that Jesus Christ will come and with the flesh that he had 2,000 years ago that he will walk again on the streets people will see him no they coming at the end time the form that it choose to be is your form is your flesh is your body so remember he says the work that I do ye shall do also when it said I'm going to the father but that's not the end of it I'll come again what did he go to do at the father he went and he took the book of redemption after he already paid the price he took the book the book that was taken away from you he went and he took the book and in Revelation 10:7 it came down and he handed you back to PO so that the works that he did you can do also the same Jesus otherwise he not the same yesterday today and forever it's the same so we would see Jesus those that saw him it's not because they recognize him for the flesh that he was in it's because they recognized him for the word that he was being revealed into the scripture will say in Matthew 13 and6 it says but blessed are your eyes for their sea and your ears for to hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see him to see those things which ye see and then have not seen them and to hear those those things which ye hear but have not heard them it says in Luke 10 and 23 it says and he turned unto his disciple and he says he said privately blessed are your eyes which see the things ye see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desire to see those things which he see and have not seen them and have heard and to hear the things which he hear and have not heard them in 2 Corinthians 4 and6 it says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness had had shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ it's not by our own self he he chose to open up your eyes and our understanding so we can see him for who he is he chose for us to for our eyes to be open for the opportunity to be given to us so we can hear this message so we can know this message and with with knowing it with hearing it he has also given not just the form of understanding but he's given the power of transformation so we can become what the message says we are with that he's given the authority that we can stand here this morning and say that what that message what the prophet said we are I am this morning what the prophet proclaimed that I will be I am today because remember but when I'm will say this I don't have the rept with me he says how did Jesus come he said that Jesus came by the words of the Prophet prophet Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and and the word of God was hanging out there until there was a virgin found called Mary the word of God that was hanging for hundreds of years came from what it was that Isaiah spoke many people between the time that Isaiah spoke until the time of Mary they looked at it and they thought that probably was the craziest chapter in the Bible some looked at him and and like but Paul was saying they thought oh it's my daughter it's this it there so much happened but God knew the time and the person that was going to fulfill that prophecy and one day that prophecy came to pass and then that prophecy came to pass butam says that how was he identified it says one Prophet spoke about it and another Prophet looked at him and saids Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world so one Prophet talked about it another Prophet came and confirmed that today the scriptures fulfilled and let me say as they ask a question how is the bride going to come there will be another prophet in Malachi 4 who will speak about the bride that will come and at the end time where are we he came and he prophesied how that the bride will come and she will be born of his born and she will be power of his power the those same works that Christ did she will do also and that same prophets came and he said you are the thoughts of God manifested for this time now what did Mary do to Merit that nothing what did you do to Merit this nothing but what did Mary do be unto be according to th word I I don't know how I'm going to be pregnant with a child when I don't know no man that exceeds my understanding how is it that I'm going to be pregnant with a baby and have a child how is it that I'm going to go in the Rapture how is it that I'm going to have a body change I don't know how to explain how is it that I'm going to overcome all the challenges I see in front of me I don't know but one thing I know is you have spoken and you have the power to bring it to pass all I say Let It Be unto me according to the word my brother my sister we are not the one bringing the word he's bringing his word to come to pass God is looking for a willing vessel someone crazy enough to believe the impossible someone crazy enough to stand and say I believe the word of God I'll be I believe there'll be a Rapture and God looks at him and says I will vindicate the crazy the problem is we we like to filter everything through our human understanding is it making sense really if it makes sense we are all for it if it's crazy I don't know I we we remember we we like to see it happen before and then we believe no Mary believed the impossible but when I'm said she didn't have a reference in the Bible that she could go and say that oh I know of someone who conceive without knowing a Man Zero but the same God who spoke it was the same God who was able to bring it to pass my brother my sister your body change is going to come the same way the same God who spoke it the same God will come to bring it to pass hallelujah what are we afraid of we we we we serve the almighty God the creator of Heaven and Earth we heard it through our meeting he's a unlimited God he's the one who does everything are we afraid of what people are going to think of us let me tell you they already think you're crazy I might as well continue in the crazy Noah was taught crazy tell me one that never was taught to be crazy Simeon will start crazy your age you're going to see the coming of the Lord every day the scripture says he came in the temple praise God today is the day praise God today is the day today praise God I got a revelation that I shall not die until I see the coming of the Lord praise God he kept testifying every day of the crazy and one day a baby was brought into the temple what what says when that baby when they brought that baby she didn't look anything like what would happen in fact she didn't have the great clothes or or great ceremony he was wiping to swatling cloth and perhaps it look like a homeless and it looked like nothing but what was it it was the Fulfillment of the prophecy we were fellowshipping with the brothers the other day I said you can take this Bible and line up every single prophecy and every single time that God has fulfilled filed it and say that I know exactly how it's going to come and when he shows up it's going to be not according to anything you were thinking but yet it will be according to the scriptures he wants you to know that he's God he doesn't want you to mix him with everything else he wants you to know that he's a unique God he's the god of the impossible when he steps into a situation no matter how hard the situation is is he wants you at the end of your situation to know that I have made the god of the impossible the doctor look I said oh it looks like you have a problem you know it looks like with what you have based on the history that we have based on the data that we've gathered this is going to take six months for you to be well they come back the next day you walk and they said what happened he says well perhaps we miscalculated no the god of the impossible step oh if only Tom could stand still the prophet will say it speaks about the scripture we read in Romans it says trusting you have your Bible open and everyone and across the country we want to read and and uh read closely now it says now our message is is is a message out there of here it says it seems like it's about marriage and divorce but it's really to me it it calls it it's the prophecy of the church in the last day he's and let me say this the the word of God is always a prophecy the the word of God is what tells you of what you're going to be before you even are the the word of God because remember if the word is not spoken then what what what's the expectation of being that but the word of God goes before you to prepare the way so you can obtain what God is calling you to be so what he's saying is that this is the prophecy of the church in the end time so he's prophesying of a condition in the people that are going to be called an elected people a people that will be taken out of the world and the things of the world and they are called to manifest Christ like nobody before they are called to be the culmination of the ministry of what God has been working from from the beginning of time so now he saying but this is a prophecy I want you when you hear the word of God say that this is a prophecy to me when I hear the message of God being spoken when I hear the prophet speaking and if I feel I'm falling short all I need to know this is a prophecy to me why because God doesn't speak unless he has the power to bring you to pass God doesn't speak unless the word can fulfill what he spoke for so when he's speaking he's wanting us to take it and know that this is a prophecy to me so when he's speaking here he's saying that that there would be an elected people on Earth that that in this age that would receive the word of God for their age and God pattern will never be changed and is the same yesterday today and forever and the prophecy is calling this and saying that this is an illustration of what the time that we are living in and is warning us about something he he's here saying because I and and he says here if I could just read it for the sake of time paragraph uh 35 he says now Paul here is giving an illustration uh in our scripture about the law of of of about the law and Grace an illustration it uh it's like marriage and divorce the passage is very seldom preached on because it's more or less uh pertain to like marriage and divorce but it's also pertaining to the greater portion of marriage and divorce it says un how we are trying how he trying to set in order here it says we as a church can no more be married to the world and to Christ and at the same time and be legal and lawful about it then it could be uh it could be for a woman then it can be for a woman to be uh living with a husband while she's got a living husband and I have my own thoughts on that and I believe that uh what the Bible says is true so he's bringing us here in remembrance of something and I I I know I I've already run out of time I'm not going to finish but let me just say this so he's wanting us to be really careful and and and and come through this greater understanding that we we cannot uh believe the things that we just talked about and still work and function and and still bu be married to the world that that the the hindrance here is not that the world has not the word of God has not spoken about you being Christlike it's not that God has spoken to you and say that you are just like me but it does it wants you not to be caught into the things of the world God wants the word that you have heard he wants you to act by it to walk by it to feed by it to do everything so it can become effective in your life that that that the what what Satan the the best thing that he's always done with our life is to always get get us caught between two opinions and oh I have the Flesh and but I have this and the word said I'm this but I got to work and and I have a job I got to feed my family and then you always get to fight between the two and and you don't know what to do and today you act like a Son of God tomorrow you act like a a sinner tomorrow you do this and and then being CL between the two can never bring you to the Perfection of what God wants you to to be what God is saying is saying I'm speaking my word to you I want you to fully consider and walk in the word that I have given you for it to be effective in your life you see that let me say this God knows we have builds to pay God knows we have challenges God knows all of that and I believe if we fully take his word his word will produce everything that we have need of you know the the devil is breaking up this dance and a church where you you say you believe the message but he wants you to just be around the message right you know as long as I can dress right and as long as I can I can talk right as long as no the message is for more than that the message is to change the Inner Man and produce the character of Christ out of you that's right you know as long as I know God sent a message well it's not good enough to just know that God sent a message is to know that that message is for you and to change you you see so it's not it's not going to stop you I if it's just an intellectual approach and an intellectual Gathering intellectual uh uh understanding of what the whole thing is all about but what is what he doesn't want you to do is to die to yourself and fully be committed to it he doesn't want you to get to a place where he said I Lay My Life down I'm dying to myself I'm going to take the word of God no matter what he doesn't want you to do that and as long as you stay in that state brother rham says you shall be called she shall be called an adulterous and let me say this but God has sent something that's greater than that the prophet will say if I could just get to it it says and today we see he's different differentiating it than calling one the church natural and the other the church spirit spiritual it says now today as we see the church natural is your intellectual gospel and going further and further away from the word in a so in in in Social Gospel and we find that the that the woman of the world and and on the streets member of such of such is carrying themselves in the same atmosphere you can't tell them they've they've lost all sense of eom deeny and the people have it says that's the word the church is has he says you you can see it going straight to the econ e EC commical Council just as certain as anything in the world and and and writing into Rome as hard as he can as he can go CZ it's prophesied and there it is that's her behavior I thought about it and because we were talking about it with the brothers you know but Paul sent me a a thing where he said that oh in Texas they decided that they're going to bring back the Bible into schools and everybody's like heyen that's wonderful my question is who's doing it the the word of God the god God is never interested in conversion by government God is not interested for us to go out there and arrest everybody and say if you don't believe a message we'll put you in jail that's right no God is is God his own chosen people God is placing the seed inside of your heart so when you hear the heart you are fully converted you are fully transformed and let me say this I'll take a transform person anytime than a person who's working by government because the hearts is not in it to begin with now it will look like it's good until they turn against you until they give the explanation of what that means you go oh no I don't believe that explanation see it God wants us to go that's why he talks about the failure of the church is that they went out there instead of preaching the gospel they were teaching the gospel oh you know you got to wear a long dress and you got to do this you got to do this then you're a message believer and somebody come dressing like that and we call him a message believer just because we can quot just because we can do that no that's not the word god called the way God called is a power of transformation in someone's heart he comes and he takes away the heart's desire for the things of the world he Chang es you and you become a fully Son of God and the daughter of God and I say this because I believe it with all my heart that that's how the gospel has always been preached from the day of Pentecost he didn't send him out there and say go teach he said go with the power of demonstration in other words you go to somebody you find them in the S you say I was a sinner that just like you are I was in the same thing that you were but God came by my way and he touched me and he changed me and that same God is here to do the same for you from Faith to Faith and the same God moves by the spoken word and he does the same to the individual today our conversion is oh I'll give you the sales book just go read it just go read it oh I read it oh I'm mean it you have to be born again that gospel is never changed you have to be born again you have to die to yourself our challenge in life is we don't die we try to conf the word of God speak and we try to find a way we can fit no what we need is a daily dying the word of God said something you said God kill me the word of God said Lord I want to die to myself I want to die until there's nothing but you that's the power of transformation we have so much pride we want people to know that we know it we want people to to be considered let me say this people consideration will not take you anywhere what you're looking for is God's consideration I want to die to the things of the world I want to die to everything I want what to Prophet spoke about to be me I want the word of God before I can speak it to somebody else I want to taste it for myself is God a Healer oh yeah I've tasted of him I tell you when you go pray for somebody and you know you've been healed there's no doubt that can stand there because you know you have been healed if you want to pray for somebody to be saved there's no doubt you know where you came from you know what God has done for you and you can stand there and say I'm calling upon the same God the same God that that's St me out of the things of the world I'm calling that same God to come upon you the gospel is by revelation God has wants us to taste of him and know that he's good otherwise we not become no different from the moment you know we go to the School of Theology we are thought and you know when you go out on Mission this is how you're going to get them ask them this questions and this questions if they answer this way if they ask you a question you can't answer called an elder really you are the Elder Peter stood on G beautiful and said silver and gold have none but that which I have what did he have he just came from the Pentecost he knew he had an experience what was promised he received it let me say this you don't have to have gone out in the world and done drugs to know God no you can know him today this morning he's the same yesterday whatever you're going through this morning you can know him this morning now I love that story that Ben was reading the a simple paper just a simple paper piece of paper that was folded and he opened it and said where would you go when you die what do you think about him just a simple note that's where it all started the prophet would say just to list desire in your heart just a heartbeat to say that God I need you is good enough to get it started and that will defeat any amount of devil that can be turned around you let me just go forward I'm sorry I I I just and so he says if you are married to Christ Christ is the word it says St John the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it says Christ was the Living Word he always was the word it says he still he is still the word he's always and will be the word he was only manifested he was only the manifestation of the attribute of God for he was the son of God he says and any son forgive me any son is the attribute of the father just you were in the gene of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy he says and he was uh you were in him yet he couldn't have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the beding ground of your mother the beding ground of the ground of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and became in the image of your father then he could have fellowship with you so you were it says so you so you so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before the found before there was a a moon and star and a or a molecule you were sons of God you were only it says you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in God at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you am and that was you now think about that that was you before it says you you don't know nothing about it neither did you when you were when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested too in the His Image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory of the uh and The Fellowship Of God and therefore as sure as the as your Gene had been uh your Gene had to be in your father before the the natural birth your spiritual de had to be in God because you are an expression of the attribute of his thought before the foundation of the world right no it says no way around it that's right he says now notice then the life that life being in you God's life being in you that from the foundation of the world let me say this that that's that's a lot to understand but I I want us to to to to come in an understanding that God is is wanting to let us know that there is really nothing new Under the Sun what what we are seeing is part of the plan that he already established what what he's telling us is we we we are coming into what was already spoken remember we said the word of God is a prophecy so now he lets us come through sin he he allows that to happen he allows us to come and and and come and know nothing about him and be born in sin and and darkness and all of that but he knew that within us there was a seed that he had placed and he also knew that when we would hear the word of God we will come to the understanding of who we were so now the prophet is telling you the Journey of your life how that where you came from and how that you go back to God so it's not us being caught up within the journey or what's happened what's happened people could have hurt you things could have gone wrong it's says that didn't matter what really matter was so you know that you were part of God in the beginning and the word that you're hearing this morning is to remind you of where you came from now if we are Gene of God then we have the characteristics of God and if we have the characteristics of God how should we conduct ourselves you see so it's always been getting caught up between the natural and the spiritual it's always getting caught up between what Satan interpretation of your life is with what God's interpretation of your life is God don't want us to come here this morning hear the word of God and go out there and act according to the interpretation of your flesh that will be a disservice to our own selves it it will do us no good to come here this morning and figure out how we're going to translate what we heard within our daily lives it wouldn't help us if our decision making is always getting caught between what is the scripture says and what do I do what oh if we can only come with the approach that no matter what decision I make I'm a Son of God to begin with I don't make a decision should I take that job should I I'm a Son of God therefore I make a decision as a Son of God I'm a Son of God therefore I conduct myself as a Son of God I can make mistake left and right but that doesn't take the sunship away the sunship is to bring me in remembrance that what you did here is not okay come back to it I'm not in bondage between God and what God is saying and what said no I cannot be between law and Grace at all time I need to be free from law and walk in Grace Oh my he he says in this message he begins to talk about how he says yeah you are you are caught between two marriages and you are married to your flesh you if I could say anything this morning we need to let the flesh die we we need if we walk every time we walk up part of our prayer should be Lord I want to be everything you say I want this flesh to die every day he he looks at you and says yeah you are you think you are married to the Flesh and married to him he said that the marriage in the flesh cannot even count because before you were even born you were already married to him go think that out it cannot even count because before you can be manifested in this flesh you already belong to him to begin with thank you Lord he says justification doesn't mean pardon justification is not forgiveness justification is everything that was accounted to you it never existed it's gone justification you never done it in the first place my brother my sister said I can't contain it within my own mind um that I'm Justified I'm the one that did wrong I'm the one who spoke evil I'm the one who did all of that he looks at you he says no that was your flesh you were tricked into it but before God before the word of God because the word that was spoken for you to begin with was that you'll be a son therefore there's nothing that could be put on your account and you tell me I don't need to be happy about that you tell me I can't Rejoice about that you tell me I have to keep quiet about that I just think we're not crazy enough I'll just say that I I just think we're not CRA I am crazy I believe it I believe it with all my heart something within my my mind tells me I'm crazy my heart said I'm happy to be crazy [Music] he said before then he took the wedding band of predestination He Slipped it on your finger because he knew that the devil would try to trick you to get into this marriage so therefore God married you so if when the devil will come he will find that you were already married and he says because of dad God can come and said this marriage is an old he could erase it all think about the power of the blood God is able to take your sins everything that you did and break it apart as if it never existed Gone Gone oh you are a sinner gone all you did this let me say this when we get to Eternity we're not going to be played all the wrong that we did no that is in the sea of God forgetfulness not to be remembered anymore that tell you the celebration out there was that I knew what was happening down there and God came and he called me out of it and all of that is annihilated gone that has to cause us to have the Thanksgiving in our hearts and if we truly claim to believe it to believe it this morning then we have to tell the neighbor about it then to have to walk in it to say God has done this for me he can do the same for you oh I'm not good enough and then yeah he's taken all of your good enough he's bundled it and threw it out and he's giving you a portion of himself so you can look at it and say I am just as God is so I am there's no what you see when you see God you see me when you see me you see God the he says the bride the bride cannot be anything different than what the bridegroom is otherwise they are not compatible if the bridegroom is the word so is the bride what does that mean to you the same characteristics the same everything that he was you are this morning that is what we are called to walk into if the musician could come we're not called to walk in defeat and look at us say oh the sickness come and then we we we fall oh God oh God God is looking at you says why cry speak why are you crying speak I but said if God had anything better to give you he would have given you but he gave you the best weapon the best that he was which was his word if his word calls you that you were an overcomer this morning don't let anything call you anything different and I don't care if it's your failures in the flesh I don't care what is it that you have that's troubling you this morning you just repeat what God Said The God Who said it will come to fulfill it what a Grace to be called sons of God this morning let's all stand but what I'm going say how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your ad daughter's parent Eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth Earth you came after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you were born in adulter adulteress it says you were a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it you had no he it says he ENT your fault you never did it because that ill germ that that was in you that was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of [Music] Life why are you calling yourself righteous God put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life God chose to do that God decided he made the decision before I can make mine he decided for me before I can know even what a decision I was making here I am and the just going in sin and all of that is looking at you it's like oh don't worry about it I already made a decision for you he placed your name and because he did that it doesn't matter what the cycle of Life take you through you could stand there and say I am justified but when I'm talks about the sheave wave offering he said that there were grains that were planted in the field and when the it because remember the sheave wave offering was a celebration what they would do is they would look and the first sheave that will come to maturity they will look at it they will stand and take it and wave it before the people and the congregation Will Rejoice praise God praise God praise God why were they rejoicing but I'm going say that it's because they knew that all of the other seed that were planted will come to that same maturity if the first one was producing what God Said will produce there is no doubt there is no devil there's nothing that could stop the others to Rejoice because they knew that they will come to the same maturity God in our age he sent a prophet not only he was a prophet but he was also a member of a bride he took a man that was born of sin and he so filled his life that a man could come and he could could speak scroll into existence he could stop the storm he could live such a life that people will look at him and think it was Jesus people will look at a man born of sin and think they saw Jesus my brother my sister that was not just for the prophet we can Rejoice this morning and say praise God why because we are of the same crop we are of the same seed we are of the same age we are of the same hour that that same life that live in him is living in you this morning to bring you to that same maturity yes sir you know I like that story but when him talks about the man with his wife and they called to the hospital to come and pray for the daughter he came and he said that the nurses and the doctors they looked in it it seemed to have been fine everything to see I'm talking about Thanksgiving they looked at it and they said oh he's gone too far we never have measurements like this and it seems like this is impossible nothing can ever be done according to their readings and everything it seems like everything was gone too far but all this couple all that they wanted was just the prophet to come and pray and then the prophet came and stumbling there and perhaps a little bit late and he showed up and and then the nurse comes and he goes and everybody he says what he says oh the prophet here can you pray and the the prophet says a little prayer nothing happened zero they it prayed and everything and they said oh they done praying and all of that and they left and everything and as he was leaving the nurse looked at him and said I can't believe you just did that it says what did you do it says that kid is in the condition that he never been before we have ever never had any recording of such data and the person comes back and then he looks at them and said he started talking to the dad and all of the sudden because of the prayer the parents begin to Rejoice oh praise God this is going to work out our problem is we pray we keep worried we pray but we still have pray fear my brother my sister once you already pray you just go on rejoicing you just go on praising God what we need after prayer is rejoicing and Thanksgiving what we need after prayer is just to praise God oh he's already taken care of and they just begin to danc and to just shout and oh praise God we heard the word of God we praise God our Prophet is pray we praise God and all of that and so the parent I love that that man had compassion he looks at the nurse and he loved the nurse he said listen to me my young daughter said the thing is what you don't understand is you are here looking at all the data this science and technology is giving you you're looking at all the data and you're doing right because that's all you know but we are looking at the promise we know that he who made the promise will make it true we know that the word has already been spoken and there's nothing that can stop it to come to pass what they were rejoicing about was because they know that the word went forth if the prophet spoke that baby that boy came back to life can he not did he not speak the same about you then why do we not have to Rejoice why do we have to worry about this morning why don't we just go home rejoicing praise God he called me a son I will be a son praise God he called me a daughter I'll be a daughter it doesn't matter what my situation is this morning one thing I know is in my flesh I shall see God it's not by your might it's not by your power it's by the spirit of the Lord making his word a reality in your lifeall we need to be moved from worry into Thanksgiving we need to be moved from worry into Thanksgiving we need to be moved into wondering into let me ask you this next time something happened you do something you thought you were not supposed to do just start praising God very good yes brother good next time you stumble just stand up and say praise God my salvation is around the corner praise God one day this is going to be taken off of me one day I'll do this for the last time one day I'm not going to be it why because he wants you to he wants to see that you will stand there no matter what I want to be like Uncle B Robinson has said I'll stand here I'll kneel down here you will find my bones coming until you come back I will not move until the word becomes a reality in my life we give up too quickly the word is spoken We Believe two minutes down the road we want another word to be added on top no one word for him from him is more than a thousand words from men if he spoke once it will come to pass let's bow our heads this morning father we have so much to be thankful for lord lord I feel ashamed this morning even speaking Lord how many times have you spoken to me Lord through your word and and yet I come to a place where it sounds like I'm doubting and L your your voice Lord transcends all Dimensions if when you sp spoke at the tomb of Lazarus he crossed the this Mortal Dimension he went into the dead and he went into Paradise wherever Lazarus was over it didn't matter where his Spirit was at you brought it right back into existence again and you lift him up you you brought him up from the tomb and and he came out father that voice of a resurrection is what we are hearing through your message of your Prophet you said
