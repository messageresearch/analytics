[13:41] special. Amen. If we could bring it at
[13:43] this time.
[14:29] Yeah, this song is was kind of
[14:31] unplanned. Sing just a closer walk if
[14:35] the team in the back can help me with
[14:36] it. Uh just derives out of a little
[14:39] testimony today. Witness our work. We
[14:42] had a we have a young lady that just got
[14:44] hired long ago after me that's uh been
[14:48] working in the office and today she ate
[14:51] something. It's either spiked her sugar
[14:54] pressure or dropped it low. I don't know
[14:57] the difference between them but um after
[15:00] eating that thing she just collapsed at
[15:02] work and
[15:04] the ambulance took almost 25 minutes to
[15:08] come you know. Um, we had we have people
[15:12] that has experienced at work kind of
[15:14] just like trying to maneuver their way
[15:16] around her. And as I was sitting there,
[15:19] I was just like, "Can I pray for her?
[15:21] Can I pray for her?" And um, you know,
[15:24] HR out there in corporate office like,
[15:26] "Hey, stay away." So I was like, "No, we
[15:28] just say a word of prayer for her." And
[15:31] I approached, I just got as close as I
[15:33] could. uh prayed for her and then kind
[15:36] of stood back because you know the big
[15:38] bosses everybody they're in panic and
[15:41] then a while after they got a hold of
[15:43] her mom on the phone
[15:45] and you know I just knew from that
[15:48] moment things will be fine and the
[15:50] mother was like trying to speak to her
[15:52] you know Tyler can you come back can you
[15:55] hear me you know just like can you guys
[15:57] lay on the side you know just right
[15:59] there at that moment I just noticed you
[16:01] know things started to change and before
[16:03] the ambulance came, she actually was
[16:05] able to start breathing back again. And
[16:09] you know, to me it was a testimony
[16:11] because I was trying to get to her, but
[16:13] then through that, you know, it could
[16:15] have been death. You know, her mom was
[16:17] like, "Oh yeah, if the ambulance is
[16:20] taking long, it's going to cost her
[16:22] life." And even though it took almost 25
[16:26] to 22 minutes for the ambulance to come,
[16:29] know the angel of the Lord touched her.
[16:31] Amen. So just when I sing a song just a
[16:34] closer walk. It was a very good reminder
[16:36] that to me you can live any day. Just
[16:39] have a closer walk. If you can help me
[16:41] with it.

[22:04] uh well. Amen. Also um uh there was a
[22:08] request put in. I believe this from

[22:17] whose little boy um u had a pan of oil
[22:21] fell upon him and he was burned entire
[22:24] body. He's only four years old. His name
[22:26] is Lucas Kudo. Um the report is that uh
[22:30] he's in a stable condition waiting for
[22:32] result for surgery. Many of uh perhaps
[22:37] he'll have many more surgeries because
[22:39] uh his body is burned really bad in many
[22:41] areas back and and and his head and the
[22:45] blood is not circulating well in those
[22:48] areas. We're just going to continue to

[32:08] and ask that you would be merciful and
[32:10] Father, that you'd be glorified. That
[32:12] you'd bring healing and Lord, you're the
[32:15] creator. You'd create skin and Father,
[32:17] you'd bring peace and
[32:20] be with the child. Father, Lord,
[32:22] tonight, Lord, we stand in need of you
[32:25] as well, Lord. We need you to come. And
[32:27] Father, there could be situations that
[32:29] just seem impossible spiritually. Lord,
[32:32] if we were to look, Lord, the needs of
[32:34] your people could be great.
[32:36] Lord, we would say there's no remedy.
[32:40] This is too much. The mind is too
[32:42] scarred. The spirit is too broken.
[32:46] There's no no hope. But with you, all
[32:49] things are possible. So, Father, we're
[32:51] looking to you now to come and break the
[32:53] words of life to us. May you just be the
[32:55] one who ministers life. Lord, we're
[32:57] believing for great things because we're
[32:59] your people and you love us and you
[33:02] desire good things for us. We pray and
[33:04] ask these things in the name of Jesus
[33:06] Christ. Amen. If you could turn with me
[33:08] in your Bibles, we're going to read out
[33:10] of Romans chapter 5,
[33:16] starting at verse 12,
[33:21] it would read, "Wherefore, as by one man
[33:24] sin entered into the world, and death by
[33:26] sin, and so death passed upon all men,
[33:30] for that all have sinned.
[33:33] For until the law, sin was in the world,
[33:37] but sin is not imputed when there is no
[33:41] law. Nevertheless, death reigned from
[33:44] Adam
[33:47] to Moses, even over them that had not
[33:51] sinned after the simultude of Adam's
[33:54] transgression, who is in the figure of
[33:56] him that was to come. Adam being in the
[33:59] figure of him who is to come. But not as
[34:02] the offense, so also is the free gift.
[34:07] For though,
[34:09] or through the offense of one, many be
[34:12] dead, much more the grace of God, and
[34:15] the gift by grace, which is by one man,
[34:17] Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
[34:21] And not as it was by one that sins, so
[34:24] is the gift. For the judgment was by one
[34:26] to condemnation, but the free gift is of
[34:30] many offenses unto justification. For if
[34:33] by one man's offense death reigned by
[34:36] one, much more then which received
[34:38] abundance of grace, and of the gift of
[34:40] righteousness shall reign in life by
[34:42] one, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the
[34:46] offense of one judgment came upon all
[34:48] men to condemnation, even so by the
[34:52] righteousness of one, the free gift came
[34:55] upon all men unto justification of life.
[34:58] For as by one man disobedience many were
[35:01] made sinners, so by the obedience of one
[35:04] shall many be made righteous. Moreover,
[35:07] the law entered
[35:09] that the offense might abound. But where
[35:13] sin abounded, grace did much more
[35:15] abound.
[35:17] Amen. That as sin hath reigned unto
[35:20] death, even so might grace reign through
[35:24] the righteousness unto eternal life by
[35:27] Jesus Christ our Lord. We ask the Lord
[35:29] to add the blessing to his word. You can
[35:31] be seated.
[35:33] We'd like to fellowship with you on
[35:34] patterns. I the scripture that we just
[35:38] read lays out a pattern I I would say of
[35:40] the law the of law and sin and death and
[35:43] it's it's been a pattern that's been in
[35:45] effect from the beginning. Um there's
[35:48] ways that we could look at this that we
[35:50] would understand that uh you know
[35:52] patterns could be something that would
[35:55] you know if I was to ask how many people
[35:57] like patterns?
[36:00] No. Well I we're on the wrong subject
[36:02] tonight.
[36:04] No one here likes patterns.
[36:07] So, uh, patterns could be good things.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; And you you actually by by the time this
[36:12] is over with, I hope we'll get one hand
[36:14] raised that we like a pattern.
[36:19] There's a lot of way too much negativity
[36:21] in the building because the only thing
[36:22] everybody thought of when they thought
[36:24] of patterns is bad patterns.
[36:28] Ties have bad patterns.
[36:31] All right. So, but patterns can be good
[36:33] and bad things. I mean, in society, we
[36:35] recognize a lot of things have patterns.
[36:37] We would say people are maybe going to
[36:39] be patterned after their family. Um, you
[36:42] know, if you've if your parents didn't
[36:44] go to college, you probably won't go to
[36:46] college. uh there's a lot of things that
[36:49] we would maybe recognize can be uh
[36:53] socio or something like that patterns
[36:55] that are after society that society
[36:57] would say hey uh there's things that you
[36:59] can predict are going to occur because
[37:01] things tend to fall into patterns we
[37:03] have weather patterns um is it El Nino I
[37:06] think is like there's certain things
[37:08] that fall in patterns so I would say
[37:10] there's enough body of evidence to say
[37:12] that God is a god of order um that the
[37:15] solar system everything there's a
[37:17] pattern. He he would use uh pre-
[37:20] symbols, forerunners. He would show
[37:22] things that were to come. God is
[37:24] actually a god of patterns. So, who
[37:26] likes patterns?
[37:28] Praise the Lord. We can go home now.
[37:34] We've we went from not liking something,
[37:36] you know, to liking something. That's
[37:37] amazing. But yeah, patterns are
[37:40] something we should be aware of because
[37:42] they become very uh uh when you could
[37:44] see a pattern or you could see a
[37:46] principle, when you could see that God
[37:48] does something a certain way, then you
[37:50] can have confidence that this is the way
[37:53] God operates,
[37:54] &gt;&gt; okay? Because that's what we just want
[37:56] to fellowship with you on. So, we've
[37:58] laid that out there. We're we're talking
[38:00] about patterns in general. Now, there
[38:01] could be um patterns that are are not
[38:04] absolute. Some patterns may consistently
[38:08] reproduce and then all of a sudden you
[38:09] have an outlier. You have a a a curve
[38:12] breaker uh that something all of a
[38:15] sudden just defies the pattern and
[38:17] you're no longer able to make
[38:19] predictions by the pattern or that the
[38:21] models just break. You know, they
[38:23] because of the one thing that upset the
[38:25] pattern, the prediction models are off
[38:28] the charts now. You try to map where a
[38:31] hurricane goes and all of a sudden it's
[38:32] like
[38:34] and there's things uh that affect
[38:36] patterns. I think there's butterfly
[38:38] effects. There's quite a study. You
[38:40] could be fascinated by patterns. And no
[38:42] one was at the start. But
[38:46] 2 Thessalonians 3:9 says, "Not because
[38:49] we have not power, but to make ourselves
[38:52] an end sample unto you to follow us." So
[38:55] an end sample there is a pattern. So you
[38:57] are a pattern. You are disciples read of
[38:59] all men. The things you do, someone will
[39:02] follow after and do after you. Every
[39:04] single one of you is actually living a
[39:06] pattern that someone in some way will
[39:09] emulate.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; It it just is a given. You you someone's
[39:14] going to do what you do. And please
[39:16] don't do what I do. Do as I say, not as
[39:20] I do. I think we went through that on
[39:21] our very first service was uh don't
[39:24] don't do like I do because you might end
[39:27] up with a boo boo.
[39:30] So we make mistakes and that is is a
[39:32] tragedy. There's others that will repeat
[39:34] our mistakes. Um so we should always be
[39:37] aware that there's a pattern that's
[39:38] going to occur that's going to repeat
[39:40] and there's consequences to patterns but
[39:43] there's also blessings and patterns and
[39:46] we want to just continue fellowshipping
[39:48] on those. Um, you know, it was even by
[39:51] the pattern of life and death that we
[39:53] would establish. It was disbelieving
[39:55] God's word that death entered in. So,
[39:58] when you disbelieve God's word, there's
[40:00] a pattern that there's death that
[40:02] follows. You're not going to defy the
[40:05] law of God that says if you transgress
[40:07] the word, there's death. There's
[40:09] separation. There's going to be a
[40:11] consequence for sin. If there's sin, the
[40:14] law requires death. That's the pattern.
[40:16] That was the pattern that was set in the
[40:18] beginning. That was the separation. It
[40:21] was because there was disbelief that
[40:23] they had to leave the garden of Eden.
[40:25] There was a consequence. That's the
[40:27] pattern.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; So you are going to die is the pattern.
[40:34] Sin demands death. That's the pattern.
[40:38] There's an established you were born and
[40:42] and you will die. That's the pattern. So
[40:45] there's there's some absolute uh if we
[40:48] would say there's some pretty uh
[40:51] illrefutable patterns that mankind has
[40:53] been subject to and it's because of sin.
[40:56] It's because as we read in our text it's
[40:58] sin entered in and so there's now death
[41:01] reigns.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; That's a pattern.
[41:07] And even in the book of Revelations, it
[41:09] would say that if you take away from the
[41:11] word of God or add to, there's a
[41:14] consequence. So there's always a
[41:16] consequence for transgressing God's
[41:18] word. As we read in our text, I the law
[41:22] has been given
[41:25] &gt;&gt; and I would all are guilty.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; There is none that has not transgressed
[41:31] the law. Right?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; If if you think you are able to carry
[41:34] yourself in your own righteousness,
[41:36] you're wrong. The law has declared you
[41:38] guilty.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; We've all showed up Wednesday night
[41:42] sleepy to church.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; We've all not been in it like our like
[41:49] someone's salvation deter was determined
[41:52] by our attitude towards the service.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; We all have not taken our diligence
[41:57] towards the things of God that we
[41:59] should.
[42:01] What? Iniquity is to know to do things
[42:03] and to not do them.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; So there's iniquity.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; And we're not asking for justice. I'm
[42:11] not being the prosecutor here declaring
[42:14] you all guilty, but I want you to
[42:16] understand that the pattern requires a
[42:20] penalty.
[42:24] John 1 chapter 28 says, "These things
[42:27] were done
[42:29] in Bethesda beyond Jordan, where John
[42:32] was baptizing. The next day John seeth
[42:34] Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
[42:36] the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
[42:39] sin of the world. This is whom I said
[42:42] after me, cometh the man who which is
[42:45] preferred before me. For he was before
[42:48] me, and I knew him not, but he should be
[42:53] made manifest to Israel. Therefore, I am
[42:56] come baptizing with water. And John bare
[42:59] record, saying, I saw the spirit
[43:01] descending from heaven like a dove, and
[43:03] it aboved upon him. So, here's John
[43:07] fulfilling the commission. He has a
[43:10] revelation. I want you to understand, we
[43:12] are not immune from pattern. It would be
[43:15] John that later on would be questioning,
[43:18] is this the one?
[43:22] &gt;&gt; It it seems hard to believe that would
[43:24] be the case. Here's the one who saw the
[43:27] dove,
[43:28] &gt;&gt; the spirit descending,
[43:30] who declared out of his own lips, this
[43:32] is the one. And yet, you'll find over in
[43:35] Matthew 11:2 and 6
[43:38] through six. Now when John had heard in
[43:41] the prison the works of Christ, he sent
[43:43] two of his disciples and said unto him,
[43:46] "Art thou he who should come or do we
[43:49] look for another?" My, what a pattern.
[43:54] Having re having received the truth,
[43:58] now he's looking at the very promise
[44:00] fulfilled and questioning
[44:03] &gt;&gt; whether it's the one.
[44:06] Can this be?
[44:09] And there's an antidote.
[44:11] Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go
[44:13] show John again those things which you
[44:15] do hear and see. The blind receive their
[44:18] sight. The lame walk, the lepers are
[44:21] cleansed, and the deaf hear. The dead
[44:23] are raised up, and the poor have the
[44:25] gospel preached to them. And blessed is
[44:27] he who shall not be offended in me."
[44:29] &gt;&gt; There's one way to remove spiritual
[44:31] amnesia.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; The the prescription has not changed.
[44:38] It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[44:40] today, and forever. He said if if the
[44:43] works are not done, don't believe me.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; But the works are being done.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Luke 7 18-23.
[44:57] And the disciples of John showed him all
[44:59] these things. And J John con called unto
[45:02] the two of his disciples and sent them
[45:04] to Jesus, saying, "Art thou he who
[45:07] should come, or do we look for another?"
[45:11] When the men were coming unto him, they
[45:13] said, "John Baptist has sent us unto
[45:15] thee." Imagine Jesus
[45:19] hearing this, saying, "Art thou he?
[45:24] Art thou he that should come? Or look we
[45:27] for another."
[45:29] And it ca and in that same hour he cured
[45:32] many of their infirmities and plagues
[45:34] and evil spirits and unto many that were
[45:37] blind he gave sight. Then Jesus said
[45:41] unto them, "Go your way and tell John
[45:43] what things ye have seen and heard. How
[45:46] that the blind see, the lame walk, the
[45:48] lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
[45:50] the dead are raised. To the poor the
[45:53] gospel is preached, and blessed is he
[45:55] whosoever is not offended in me."
[45:58] So we have Matthew,
[46:00] we have Luke giving the same account of
[46:03] a prescription for removing spiritual
[46:06] amnesia
[46:10] &gt;&gt; and it's it's a cure.
[46:14] But one thing we have to recognize that
[46:15] if it could happen to a prophet
[46:19] &gt;&gt; and there's other examples through the
[46:20] scripture and we don't want to just
[46:23] stick to this pattern but we have to
[46:26] recognize that there is a pattern
[46:29] where we need to be strengthened in the
[46:31] Lord.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; We have to be 100% assured from whence
[46:36] comes our help.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And we need to know that we need to be
[46:39] in expectation of a supernatural
[46:41] deliverance. We're not we're not wanting
[46:44] a better psychology. We're not wanting
[46:47] to just be re encouraged in our minds,
[46:49] but we want Jesus Christ to show up on
[46:51] the scene and to prove himself the same
[46:54] yesterday, today, and forever.
[46:56] Doubting Thomas
[46:59] didn't say, "I'm going to need a better
[47:01] psychology than this."
[47:04] And God didn't meet him with a better
[47:06] psychology, but he allowed him to touch
[47:08] his side.
[47:10] We want the doubt removed.
[47:20] So there's a
[47:22] there's a deception
[47:24] that many could be taken by
[47:28] and there has to be a pattern of even a
[47:31] falling away. If you look at 2
[47:32] Thessalonians 2 and3 says, "Let no man
[47:35] deceive you by any means, for that day
[47:38] shall not come except there come a
[47:40] falling away first, and that the man of
[47:43] sin be revealed, the son of predition."
[47:46] So, we're going to just labor on this a
[47:49] little bit. In every age, there's a
[47:51] pattern of a falling away.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; There's those who receive the truth,
[47:56] rejoice in the truth for their day, but
[47:57] then do not go on to a perfection. they
[48:00] don't carry on the life and there's a re
[48:02] there's a cycle of revival and death
[48:06] but we have a pattern that's key to the
[48:10] believer and that is that Jesus Christ
[48:12] is the same yesterday today and forever
[48:15] so once you have the key
[48:18] that he doesn't change then when you
[48:21] even read the old testament and start to
[48:23] look at Israel and to start to see the
[48:25] things that pertain to Israel as a
[48:27] nation and recognize that they pertain
[48:29] to you as a believer that the same way
[48:31] he deals with the church, he deals with
[48:32] the individual. You start to recognize a
[48:34] pattern that should start to build our
[48:37] faith. There's principles of God that
[48:39] are involved here.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; He can't change. And brother Brandon
[48:44] would say this in the ex in the in the
[48:46] exposition of seven church ages. This is
[48:48] in the Ephesian church age. The key
[48:50] given to me of the Lord whereby I was
[48:53] able to determine the messenger for each
[48:55] age is a is most scriptural one. In
[48:58] fact, it might be called the keystone of
[49:01] the Bible.
[49:04] I've already given it to you. Jesus
[49:06] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[49:08] forever.
[49:10] It is the revelation that God never
[49:12] changes and that he his ways are
[49:16] unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8
[49:19] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[49:21] today, and forever. Ecclesiastes
[49:23] 3:14-15.
[49:24] I know that whatsoever God doeth, it
[49:26] shall be forever.
[49:29] Nothing can be put to it, nor anything
[49:32] taken from it, and God doeth it, that
[49:34] men should fear before him. That which
[49:37] he hath been now, and that which is to
[49:41] hath already been, and God requireth
[49:43] that which is past. Here it is. Here it
[49:46] is. An unchanging God with unchanging
[49:49] ways. What he did at the first, he will
[49:52] have to keep doing until it is done for
[49:54] the last time.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; There will never be a change. Apply that
[49:58] to the church ages. The kind of man that
[50:00] God chooses at the first age and now God
[50:02] manifesting that the men's ministry
[50:05] would be the example of other ages. So
[50:07] now you have a forerunner. What God did
[50:09] in the first church age is what he wants
[50:11] to do in all other ages.
[50:14] If you've studied the church ages, you
[50:16] know that every age came in power and
[50:18] demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; There was never an age that wasn't
[50:22] marked by signs and wonders.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; We have a problem of looking back at how
[50:26] a denominated and finding that it's very
[50:28] irreconcilable that those things would
[50:31] be done by what we identify as the
[50:32] Methodist today. But you have to
[50:34] recognize what Methodists turned into
[50:36] was not the truth of their day.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; We'll just continue fellowshipping on
[50:41] that.
[50:43] Now we know exactly the word which was
[50:45] recorded by the Holy Spirit. How the
[50:47] first or the original church was founded
[50:49] and how God manifested himself in her.
[50:51] The word can't change or be changed
[50:53] because the word of God John 1:1 in the
[50:56] beginning was the word. The word was
[50:57] with God. The word was God. To change
[50:59] the word of it as did Eve bring sin and
[51:03] death. Even as it says in Revelations
[51:05] 22:18-19,
[51:06] if any man shall add any of these
[51:08] things, God shall add unto him the
[51:11] plagues that were written in the book.
[51:12] And if any man shall take away from the
[51:14] words of the book of this prophecy, God
[51:16] shall take away his part out of the book
[51:18] of life. And out of the holy city, and
[51:20] from the things that were written in the
[51:21] book, thus which the church was at the
[51:23] Pentecost is the standard. This is the
[51:26] pattern. This is no, there is no other
[51:28] pattern.
[51:30] No matter what the scholars say, God has
[51:34] not changed that pattern. What God did
[51:36] at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing
[51:39] until the church ages close.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Those scholars would tell you the
[51:45] apostoistic age is over. Don't you
[51:47] believe it? Such a statement is wrong on
[51:50] two counts. First of all, it's wrong to
[51:51] suppose there aren't any more apostles.
[51:54] There's still those sent
[51:58] &gt;&gt; just because the original 12 are dead.
[51:59] An apostle means a sent one and there
[52:02] are many sent ones today but they are
[52:04] called missionaries.
[52:07] I'm thinking of a brother in the field
[52:08] right now.
[52:14] As long as men are being called and sent
[52:16] forth with the word of life, there's an
[52:18] apostilistic age going on. Say
[52:20] hallelujah to that.
[52:23] There's a there's a there's a ministry
[52:25] that is going out that's performing the
[52:27] same Jesus Christ to the unbeliever.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; The gospel is still being preached to
[52:32] the poor. The blinded eyes are still
[52:35] being opened. There's signs and wonders
[52:37] following this gospel. Blessed are the
[52:39] feet of them.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; The gospel is going forth.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[52:46] and forever. I received a picture today
[52:48] of those being baptized in Pakistan.
[52:52] The gospel is being preached.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; There's those who are going out
[52:56] preaching the gospel.
[53:02] Those scholars may tell you the apostle
[53:04] is over. Don't you believe it? Such a
[53:06] statement is wrong on two counts. An
[53:08] apostle means one sent. There are many
[53:10] sent ones today, but they're called
[53:11] missionaries. As long as men are going,
[53:13] called sent forth the word of life,
[53:15] there is an apostilistic age going on.
[53:17] Secondly, they refer to the age of the
[53:19] manifest Holy Ghost power as being over
[53:21] since the Bible has been completed. This
[53:24] is untrue. There is not even one
[53:27] scripture that suggests that, but many
[53:29] conclusively state otherwise. Here is
[53:32] our proof that both of these charges are
[53:35] false. Acts 238:39.
[53:38] Peter said unto them, "Repent and be
[53:40] baptized every one of you in the name of
[53:42] Jesus Christ for the remissions of sin
[53:45] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[53:47] Holy Ghost."
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Our pastor's been fellowshipping on the
[53:50] commission.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; This is that
[53:55] was our heart is to understand the
[53:57] pattern of the commission.
[54:01] And Peter said unto them,"Repent and be
[54:03] baptized, every one of you in the name
[54:04] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[54:06] sins, and you shall receive the gift of
[54:08] the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the
[54:10] promise is unto you and to your
[54:12] children, unto all that are a far off,
[54:15] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[54:18] call. The promise of power that with
[54:21] which the apostles was endued at
[54:23] Pentecost is to you the Jews and to you
[54:26] the children Jews and to all that are a
[54:29] far off the Gentiles and to many as the
[54:32] Lord our God shall call both Jew and
[54:34] Gentile. Until he stops calling the
[54:37] Pentecostal message and power will not
[54:39] cease.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he's calling.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Hey, BE THE VOICE OF THE CALL.
[54:52] And the signs won't cease.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; The power is in the commission.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; With boldness, proclaim this gospel.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S DARK.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; THE HOUR'S DARK.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; How great the light that you have the
[55:14] opportunity to shine.
[55:20] What the church had at Pentecost is her
[55:23] inalienable right. Hallelujah.
[55:26] Originally, she had the pure WORD OF
[55:28] GOD. OH, I'M THANKFUL WE GOT the pure
[55:31] word of God.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; It's no longer covered up. Satan gained
[55:35] access to try to cover it up with
[55:37] intellectual thoughts. And there was a
[55:39] cycle of revival and death. But we have
[55:42] access to the pure word of God. Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you can have a confidence in
[55:47] the gospel we have.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; It's not cunning devices. It's not man's
[55:52] fables. It isn't no longer just a a a
[55:55] turning Christianity into a weak
[55:57] religion, but this is the power of
[55:58] Christ.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; It's the power of the Holy Ghost.
[56:04] Hebrews 2:1 and4, wherefore we ought to
[56:06] give more earnest heed to the things
[56:08] which we have heard, lest at any time we
[56:10] should make them slip. For if the word
[56:12] spoken by angels was steadfast, and
[56:15] every transgression and disobedience to
[56:17] the word received a just recompense
[56:22] of reward, how shall we escape
[56:26] transgression, reward? There's a
[56:29] scripturally there's a concept of
[56:31] reward. The pattern, you reap what you
[56:32] sow. There's a pattern. There's a
[56:34] pattern. What do you want to be found in
[56:36] the pattern of?
[56:40] Spoken of the word and was confirmed
[56:42] unto us to them that heard him. God also
[56:44] bearing them witness both with signs and
[56:47] wonders and with diverse miracles and
[56:49] gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[56:51] own will. The original church was not
[56:54] organized by men. It was led by the Holy
[56:56] Ghost. Pattern
[57:00] can't change. It wasn't very big. Can't
[57:03] change. It was hated and despised, can't
[57:05] change. It was oppressed, can't change.
[57:08] It was p persecuted unto death, but it
[57:11] was true to God and it stayed with the
[57:13] original word pattern.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; The church, the elect, the bride,
[57:22] they won't hear another's voice.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; The sheep hear my voice and another they
[57:27] will not follow.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; The pattern is sure. It's an
[57:32] unchangeable word of God. The word of
[57:33] God cannot return void.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And we possess the original word to be
[57:41] led of the spirit and to watch the signs
[57:44] and wonders follow
[57:45] &gt;&gt; the word. What's the pattern that we see
[57:47] all throughout the New Testament? Put
[57:49] the word of God before you. Let the word
[57:51] of God be a light into your path. The
[57:53] miracles follow just as they would put
[57:54] the ark before him.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; That is our pattern.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Word first.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:04] That's that's the pattern. And we know
[58:06] that what happen is is this people get
[58:09] the pattern out of whack.
[58:11] They follow after signs and wonders
[58:13] without putting the word first. But just
[58:16] because there's those who do that
[58:17] doesn't mean we're in some mental
[58:19] quandry about the signs and wonders
[58:21] following the word.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; We're not scared by the st scarecrow.
[58:28] We understand that God is a God of of uh
[58:31] feeding the the the multitudes. Even
[58:34] those who are not going to receive the
[58:35] word, he breaks the loaves and the
[58:38] fishes.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; To those who are going to walk away when
[58:41] he says, "Unless you eat my flesh and
[58:43] drink my blood, you have no part of me."
[58:45] There's those who reject the word of God
[58:48] who are entitled to the blessings of
[58:50] God.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; How much more?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; How much more? I look at Ishmamail and
[58:58] if he could be uh the the Lord hear the
[59:01] cries of the lad as he sits under the
[59:03] bush, not even being the child of
[59:05] promise, but being an heir of Abraham
[59:07] that he could be preserved. How much
[59:09] more the children of promise?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; His ears open unto you when you cry.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; He knows your heart's desire.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And you have to believe in his love and
[59:21] election for you. HOW MUCH HE DON'T
[59:24] SPURN his love.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; He's done everything to show you he
[59:29] cares and loves for you.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, I just picturing the baby with the
[59:37] thing being swayed before its face and
[59:39] it doesn't respond.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Let's not be blind
[59:48] down through every age.
[59:51] If we look at the church ages, and I'm
[59:53] we're not going to get in it, but I just
[59:54] want to look at Ephesians because in a
[59:56] lot of ways that was the closest to the
[59:58] original church before it started to
[1:00:01] regress, regress, regress, and and you
[1:00:03] had the the caterpillar, Palmer worm,
[1:00:05] cankerworm that the devil came against
[1:00:07] the church and and and put it in the
[1:00:10] ground. The church that the the
[1:00:13] Christians would be in the catacombs
[1:00:16] literally. Anybody know what a catacomb
[1:00:18] is?
[1:00:20] Praise the Lord. We got a couple. So,
[1:00:22] we'll tell you what a catacomb is. So, a
[1:00:24] catacomb was, I believe, a Roman
[1:00:25] institution where they would dig tunnels
[1:00:28] and they would put the bodies.
[1:00:30] They would stack up the bones. They
[1:00:32] would just they'd put them under the
[1:00:34] ground. That was a catacomb. There'd be
[1:00:37] long tunnels. So, think of a mining
[1:00:38] shaft. You know, these winding tunnels
[1:00:40] instead of a cemetery where you go in
[1:00:42] sections, you'd go down to the tunnel.
[1:00:44] You'd be like, "Take this turn, take
[1:00:45] that turn, take this turn. There's
[1:00:48] Johnny." That's a catacomb.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:00:53] Not a place you want to hang out.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; The church is in the catacombs
[1:01:00] meeting together to talk about the word
[1:01:02] of God,
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; to fellowship about the things of God.
[1:01:06] They're literally in the ground.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; The darkest it would be.
[1:01:13] That's the pattern.
[1:01:17] A seed has to go into the ground.
[1:01:22] And that's what Christ was. He was a
[1:01:25] pattern.
[1:01:28] So just to establish this, I believe
[1:01:30] we've got time. Revelations 2:4.
[1:01:33] Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[1:01:35] thee because thou hast left thy first
[1:01:37] love. To understand this you must
[1:01:40] realize that the first that the spirit
[1:01:43] is not speaking to the original saints
[1:01:45] of Ephesus alone the messages to the
[1:01:48] entire age would lasted about 120 years.
[1:01:53] So there's I believe what he's saying is
[1:01:55] this there's a there's a group that
[1:01:57] really didn't
[1:02:00] its message then is the all the
[1:02:02] generations in that span you know there
[1:02:05] there's a there's a falling away in that
[1:02:07] generation I should say just the way he
[1:02:09] said it now history keeps repeating
[1:02:11] itself that's the pattern in the
[1:02:14] generations of Israel we see a revival
[1:02:16] in one generation only to see the fires
[1:02:19] fading in the next in the third
[1:02:21] generation embers may be glowing
[1:02:24] slightly, but in the fourth there may be
[1:02:26] no vestage whatsoever of the original
[1:02:29] flame.
[1:02:32] Then God lights the fire again. The same
[1:02:36] process is repeated. It is simply the
[1:02:39] manifestation of the truth that God has
[1:02:42] no grandchildren. Salvation's not passed
[1:02:46] on by natural birth any more than there
[1:02:49] is any truth to an apostoic succession.
[1:02:53] And there's there's churches out there
[1:02:55] that that teach that. They're probably
[1:02:56] not even far from here. There's a many
[1:02:59] charismatic movements that believe in
[1:03:01] apostoistic secession. And there and
[1:03:04] they uh believe in the moving of the
[1:03:06] spirit and they believe in the authority
[1:03:08] of apostoistic secession. Like that's
[1:03:10] your So this is our our truth in our day
[1:03:15] cuts away those things.
[1:03:18] Salvation is not passed by natural birth
[1:03:20] or or any more than there is any truth
[1:03:24] to apostilistic succession. It isn't in
[1:03:27] the word. You start out with truly
[1:03:30] bornagain believers and when the next
[1:03:33] generation comes along, they are no
[1:03:35] longer just plain Christians, but they
[1:03:37] have taken a denominational name and now
[1:03:41] are Baptist, Methodist,
[1:03:44] etc.,
[1:03:46] eteretca,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; etc.
[1:03:55] Has anybody filled in gaps, etc. I need
[1:03:59] to look up the definition. I'd probably
[1:04:00] get it wrong. I believe it means and so
[1:04:02] on and so on and so on and so on. All
[1:04:04] right. So, fill in the blanks.
[1:04:08] Um, I will say personally,
[1:04:11] um, and this is just my conviction and
[1:04:13] I'll share it with you. When I say the
[1:04:16] message, it means something precious to
[1:04:18] me.
[1:04:20] I don't look at it as the false. I don't
[1:04:22] look at as the fake. Um, there's brides,
[1:04:26] brides, churches, churches. We could say
[1:04:29] the church and we could mean the church
[1:04:30] nominal.
[1:04:32] We could say things and they have a
[1:04:35] different connotation. But when Brand
[1:04:38] Brother Brandham talked about the
[1:04:39] message, he said it wouldn't denominate.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And and I when I talk about the message,
[1:04:46] I'm not talking about the denominational
[1:04:48] spirit that's never died. That's going
[1:04:51] to always attack the truth of every age.
[1:04:55] So that spirit workketh.
[1:04:58] But when I say the message, I don't I
[1:05:01] choose not to defame it
[1:05:05] to defame it with the connotation of
[1:05:08] denominationalism.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; It it has a little more sacred place
[1:05:13] than that.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Just because the Catholics can claim the
[1:05:17] cross and they call it the crucifix, I
[1:05:20] haven't denigrated the cross as being an
[1:05:23] object of Catholicism. It's still
[1:05:25] precious to me.
[1:05:28] You You can try to take something that's
[1:05:30] holy and make it unholy, but you simply
[1:05:32] just can't do it. God raised this
[1:05:35] message up.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Man can't put smud on it.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; But fill in the blank.
[1:05:47] Don't take a denominational spirit and
[1:05:50] put a label on yourself.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; You have to be born again.
[1:05:58] That is exactly what they are too. They
[1:06:00] are not Christians. You have to be born
[1:06:03] of the will of God, not of the will of
[1:06:06] man.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; I love that. Saints,
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; just encourage your heart in the very
[1:06:12] experience that you've had. If you've
[1:06:14] ever had an experience of with God, it
[1:06:16] is not because you willed it.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; You didn't make yourself good enough.
[1:06:24] It is by the grace of God that he would
[1:06:26] have you experience his presence. What
[1:06:28] is man that thou are mindful of him or
[1:06:30] the son of man that thou would visit
[1:06:32] him? What is it that a holy God would
[1:06:34] come down and visit you?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; It's no small thing.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they are too. They
[1:06:46] are not Christians. You have to be born
[1:06:49] of the will of God, not of the will of
[1:06:51] man to be saved. But these folks are
[1:06:53] coming all together now by the will of
[1:06:56] man. I don't say that some of them
[1:06:59] aren't right with God. Not for a minute
[1:07:02] do I say that. But the original fire has
[1:07:05] died down. They are not the same
[1:07:08] anymore.
[1:07:13] Just reading on. The fervent desire to
[1:07:16] please God, the passion to know his
[1:07:18] word, the cry for reaching out in the
[1:07:21] spirit. all begins to fade and instead
[1:07:24] that church being on fire with the fire
[1:07:27] of God, it is cooled off and become a
[1:07:31] bit formal.
[1:07:34] Church, this word starts to shave those
[1:07:38] things out of your life.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; It is by this word that we are made
[1:07:44] alive in Christ Jesus. This is the word
[1:07:47] of God that I'm reading to you by a
[1:07:49] prophet messenger coming and telling you
[1:07:52] what the enemy has done. The
[1:07:53] caterpillar, the palmer worm with the
[1:07:55] promise of I will restore, sayeth the
[1:07:57] Lord. And this message does it. It's
[1:07:59] these divine revealed truths that do it.
[1:08:02] It's this word that can't return void.
[1:08:05] I'm reading you a prophet's word because
[1:08:07] it will accomplish what it was sent for.
[1:08:10] I could I could tell you these things
[1:08:12] and and and and adlib them, but there's
[1:08:14] a confidence in the way they were
[1:08:16] brought, the way they were said, the way
[1:08:18] God brought them that it will accomplish
[1:08:19] what God sent it to accomplish.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I I I hide behind it.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; My mind could get in get entwined of
[1:08:30] trying to express it. But this prophet
[1:08:33] was yielded to God in a way that it
[1:08:35] brought the undying word of Christ to
[1:08:37] you. and it's mocked.
[1:08:44] It's cooled off
[1:08:48] and become
[1:08:51] they're getting bit formally abnormal.
[1:08:53] The
[1:08:55] abonment
[1:08:56] to God was dying out and the people
[1:08:59] weren't too careful about what God
[1:09:03] thought of them as they began to be
[1:09:05] careful about what the world thought of
[1:09:08] them. That
[1:09:11] is a very true thing you could go study
[1:09:14] out.
[1:09:15] It's when men start to become concerned
[1:09:18] with the way they are perceived by
[1:09:20] others. They want to carry Christianity
[1:09:23] in a more dignified way. They want to
[1:09:27] present the do gospel in apologetics.
[1:09:30] I need to be able to present my doctrine
[1:09:32] to you in a way that just makes me feel
[1:09:35] good for believing it.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; It's almost like multi-level marketing.
[1:09:42] You know, I'm just I'm going to feel
[1:09:44] better about what I believe if I can
[1:09:46] convince you I can believe it or you can
[1:09:48] believe it and then we then we both
[1:09:50] believe it.
[1:09:51] And now I feel better because I thought
[1:09:54] a lot of you and now you believe it too.
[1:09:56] And it's just now let's both come up
[1:09:59] with an idea of how we could get others
[1:10:00] to believe this. Make it sound better.
[1:10:03] And they start to take the reproach the
[1:10:06] way God brought the gospel away from the
[1:10:09] gospel.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you church, you can
[1:10:12] never do away with the reproach of the
[1:10:14] gospel.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus Christ come in a manger
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; pattern? Was
[1:10:21] there a reproach? How many people been
[1:10:24] to a barn?
[1:10:28] Okay. How many people would go walk
[1:10:30] around barefoot in a barn?
[1:10:34] I knew there were some people that did
[1:10:35] it.
[1:10:38] I I had some people in my head I knew
[1:10:40] would.
[1:10:42] If you're country, you're country. Okay.
[1:10:45] Your feet wash off probably easier than
[1:10:47] your boots. So,
[1:10:50] but that's my point, right? That's what
[1:10:53] culture does to you, right? I mean, the
[1:10:56] people who know a barn are okay with it.
[1:11:00] But those who put a reproach on it,
[1:11:05] they wouldn't do it.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; But that's the really the place where
[1:11:09] the issues of life are happening, right?
[1:11:12] But man, in our thinking, ooh, stinky.
[1:11:15] Well, you wouldn't be eating if not for
[1:11:17] a barn.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I I even if you're a vegetarian,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; you probably wouldn't have got
[1:11:25] fertilizer on your crop if not for the
[1:11:27] barn.
[1:11:33] Sorry.
[1:11:36] So, respect the barn. But that's what
[1:11:39] brother Brandon would say is the
[1:11:41] culture, what culture is and what it
[1:11:44] does. So I I I don't want you to get
[1:11:46] away with that.
[1:11:48] Make sure you understand this is a
[1:11:49] pattern that Satan will attack you with.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; You know, he tells the story about the
[1:11:55] girl who was her.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; She went to college. She was very
[1:12:03] beautiful. She come back with her
[1:12:05] friends and her mother
[1:12:07] went to meet her
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; and she was horribly disfigured. and
[1:12:12] because she was worried about what her
[1:12:14] friends thought,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; So, this plays out all the time.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; You You may even despise the Christian
[1:12:25] upbringing, the very thing that's
[1:12:26] protected you from the flames of this
[1:12:28] world. The very thing that has made sure
[1:12:31] you have a sound mind, the very thing
[1:12:33] that has preserved you and your parents
[1:12:35] have stood for and fought the fight, yet
[1:12:37] you will defame it.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Because you're more concerned about what
[1:12:41] your friends think.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; So don't think this is just some
[1:12:47] allegory of some other age. This comes
[1:12:50] really home right down close and
[1:12:52] personal.
[1:12:58] Once the son of predition is exposed, it
[1:13:00] gives you power to overcome
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; the he he he rode out down through all
[1:13:07] the ages.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; And he does it so. But pride
[1:13:14] defileth many.
[1:13:17] Such an evil thing. And you'll deny the
[1:13:21] very gospel o over it. The second
[1:13:24] generation coming on was just like
[1:13:25] Israel. They demanded a king to be like
[1:13:28] the other nations. When they did that,
[1:13:30] they rejected God, but they did it
[1:13:32] anyways. That is the history of the
[1:13:34] church. When it thinks more of
[1:13:36] conforming to the world instead of
[1:13:38] conforming to God, it isn't long until
[1:13:40] you see them stop doing the things that
[1:13:42] they used to do and start doing the
[1:13:45] things they wouldn't do initially. They
[1:13:47] change their manner of dress, their
[1:13:49] attitudes, and their behavior. They get
[1:13:51] lax. That is what e ephesus means.
[1:13:54] Relaxing drifting. The cycle of revival
[1:13:58] and death has never failed. All you have
[1:14:01] to do is recall the last move of God in
[1:14:04] the spirit when men and women dressed
[1:14:06] like Christians went to church and
[1:14:08] prayed all night and took to the street
[1:14:10] corners and weren't ashamed of the
[1:14:12] manifestations of the spirit.
[1:14:18] They left their old dead churches and
[1:14:20] worship in homes or old store buildings.
[1:14:23] They had reality. Hallelujah.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; I remember telling my brother Aaron, you
[1:14:29] know, reality is an empty apartment and
[1:14:31] a 50 lb bag of rice.
[1:14:34] I don't know why I said that, but I
[1:14:37] think I was trying to say that, you
[1:14:38] know, you just get down to the
[1:14:39] rudimentary things, you can make it. You
[1:14:41] know, you just need to be willing to to
[1:14:43] do what you need to do. You could
[1:14:45] survive in this world. But the reality
[1:14:47] is in Christ Jesus.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; The reality is in knowing him. The
[1:14:51] reality is that his blessings are here
[1:14:53] and they're overflowing.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; They had reality. But it wasn't too long
[1:14:59] a time until they began to get enough
[1:15:02] money to build fine new churches. They
[1:15:05] put in a choir. Instead of singing unto
[1:15:06] God for themselves, they put in gowns in
[1:15:08] the choir. They organized the movement.
[1:15:10] They ran it by man. You know that's we
[1:15:13] we have church cood and I'm not going to
[1:15:15] get into it. But it's the pastor.
[1:15:21] If you don't believe that you don't
[1:15:22] believe this message. They soon began to
[1:15:25] read their books. If you resent that,
[1:15:28] get converted. They let down the bars
[1:15:31] and the goats come in and took over.
[1:15:34] They cry. The cry of joy was gone. and
[1:15:37] it I can't get away from it. So, you
[1:15:42] lift up your pastor in prayer.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need to step back. He has to
[1:15:47] step up.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the joy of a of of of in
[1:15:52] his office. He could do many things at
[1:15:54] his discretion. But at the end of the
[1:15:56] day, he's the one who's answering.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; He can't say it was Ben.
[1:16:02] Ben did it. Billy did it.
[1:16:07] It's our pastor.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; He's given to lead the flock.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; He may delegate things, but that's still
[1:16:14] on him.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; And we act under the headship of our
[1:16:20] pastor.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; As a son, I've always been careful
[1:16:24] anytime I'm doing something in the I
[1:16:26] have access to him as my father, but
[1:16:28] there's times I go to him and say, you
[1:16:30] know, pastor, can I do this? Maybe I
[1:16:34] short circuit the process, but I go
[1:16:36] straight to the pastor and I get the PL
[1:16:37] pastor's blessing
[1:16:39] because there's authority in headship.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; That is a pattern.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; There's an order of blessing. You go
[1:16:46] look at birthright. You go look at
[1:16:47] everything and you do something outside
[1:16:49] of the headship, it's really hard to be
[1:16:51] blessed.
[1:16:54] And that's that is why you have to pray
[1:16:56] for your pastor because it's hard for
[1:16:58] something to be profitable and to be
[1:17:00] blessed
[1:17:02] if your pastor doesn't bless it.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Really hard.
[1:17:10] That was
[1:17:12] not where I don't even know where I'm at
[1:17:14] anymore.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; You pray for me. But we we we want to
[1:17:19] get to this really quick.
[1:17:21] Um
[1:17:23] so we've establish
[1:17:26] a platform
[1:17:30] the cycle of revival and death
[1:17:33] would would say
[1:17:37] this age dies
[1:17:43] that we're going to end up cold and
[1:17:44] formal. We're going to end up in a
[1:17:47] church where the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:17:48] move. where our young children come up
[1:17:51] believing a theology without having an
[1:17:53] experience.
[1:17:55] The cycle of revival and death would say
[1:17:57] that by the time the third generation
[1:17:59] gets here, the embers are cold.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; There's no blessing of the Holy Ghost to
[1:18:03] set him a fire.
[1:18:06] But I want to tell you this message told
[1:18:08] us that God isn't a grandfather.
[1:18:17] You know, Martin Luther brought
[1:18:18] justification,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. And if
[1:18:25] you could just imagine the darkness they
[1:18:27] came out of to understand that assurance
[1:18:31] and the revival bells that were ringing
[1:18:33] just to rest in what faith was that I
[1:18:37] know it it's by his stripes
[1:18:40] he paid the price
[1:18:43] for therein is the righteousness of God
[1:18:45] revealed from faith to faith. It is
[1:18:47] written the just shall live by faith
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; and that was a a a light that shined in
[1:18:52] darkness. There is therefore no now no
[1:18:54] condemnation
[1:18:56] to them that that are in Christ.
[1:19:00] Therefore we conclude that a man is
[1:19:02] justified by faith without the deeds of
[1:19:04] the law. For it is by grace you are
[1:19:07] saved through faith, not of yourselves,
[1:19:10] but is a gift of God, not of works, lest
[1:19:12] any man should boast. For we are his
[1:19:15] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[1:19:17] unto good works, which God hath before
[1:19:21] ordained that we should walk in them.
[1:19:24] Yet in that blessed truth, you have a
[1:19:26] Lutheran church,
[1:19:30] I believe they have unspeakable things
[1:19:33] occurring in the name of that truth
[1:19:37] right there.
[1:19:39] That truth that sets free.
[1:19:42] That truth that rings in our hearts can
[1:19:45] be carried in such a way that it's dead.
[1:19:52] But I'll restore sayeth the Lord. Wesley
[1:19:54] understanding this
[1:19:56] truth also went on into holiness and
[1:19:59] sanctification,
[1:20:01] recognizing for it is the will of God
[1:20:04] even for your sanctification that ye
[1:20:06] shall abstain from fornication that
[1:20:08] every one of you should know how to
[1:20:10] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:20:12] honor. We haven't done away with this
[1:20:14] truth, saints. Follow peace with all men
[1:20:17] in holiness without which no man shall
[1:20:19] see the Lord.
[1:20:22] This isn't something we can do away
[1:20:24] with. Husbands, love your wives even as
[1:20:26] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:20:28] himself for it. We as Christians lay our
[1:20:31] rights down
[1:20:34] so that others can live
[1:20:38] even obedient unto death. That is our
[1:20:40] example. Christ, if we are to fight for
[1:20:43] this world, who can preserve our life?
[1:20:46] Who who do who should you fear?
[1:20:49] him him who could take this this life or
[1:20:53] him who could take this life and deliver
[1:20:55] the soul to hell.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Fear God,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; you know, and just in the way of
[1:21:04] testimony, thinking of Lucas, they
[1:21:05] boiled John in oil before they put him
[1:21:07] on Patmas.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; They couldn't take his life.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; God hasn't changed.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; What's the key? What's the pattern?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; What are we preaching? Jesus Christ the
[1:21:19] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; You are not somehow now in an age where
[1:21:23] the devil could take your life.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; If God didn't permit it,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; boo devil.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to speed up a little
[1:21:42] bit, but it there's the cycle.
[1:21:47] going to skip over some things,
[1:21:51] but I want to talk about, if you will,
[1:21:53] in the in the way that patterns run,
[1:21:58] the outlier to the pattern,
[1:22:00] the breaker of the pattern,
[1:22:03] the cycle of life and death, and I think
[1:22:06] you know of some of these, but I think
[1:22:08] of Enoch.
[1:22:11] Enoch broke the pattern.
[1:22:14] And we look at Enoch and we see the very
[1:22:17] type of the age that we're in.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; These things were given to you as an
[1:22:23] example. To you
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; this day, this hour, Enoch was given to
[1:22:30] you as an example.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; There may be those who are going to ride
[1:22:35] out the flood.
[1:22:37] They're going to go through the
[1:22:38] tribulation, but the bride does not go
[1:22:41] through the tribulation. Our
[1:22:45] messenger taught us he wouldn't do that
[1:22:47] to his bride.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; He's not going to purge his bride. She's
[1:22:51] cleansed now.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; You You have no ability to change your
[1:22:55] righteousness. He clothed you in his
[1:22:58] righteousness. HE PUT HIS NAME UPON YOU.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; He He erased the whole requirement.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; The person who made the pattern had the
[1:23:07] authority to say, "This is she.
[1:23:14] YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PATTERN of
[1:23:17] going down and dying in death.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Enoch testified of a better thing.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; He testified of a pre-tribulation
[1:23:26] rapture.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PATTERN.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; STOP PATTERNING YOURSELF AFTER SOCIAL
[1:23:33] CHRISTIAN INFLUENCERS. THAT'S NOT MY
[1:23:35] PATTERN. AMEN.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; MY PATTERN IS GOD.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; NOT SOME SOCIAL INFLUENCER who tags
[1:23:45] himself as a Christian.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's not for me.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not going through the tribulation.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; You can lay your life down, BUT THAT'S
[1:23:55] NOT ME. I'M GOING UP.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; I recognize my day in the message. I
[1:24:04] recognize where I'm standing. I'm
[1:24:06] standing on a thus sayeth the Lord
[1:24:08] prophets message.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; I know the pattern. The word of God, he
[1:24:13] doesn't do nothing unless it reveals it
[1:24:14] to the servant, the prophets first. He
[1:24:17] speaks thus sayeth THE LORD. AND WHAT
[1:24:19] CAN STAND AGAINST IT?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A SPOKEN WORD OF GOD.
[1:24:32] A PROPHET'S MESSAGE CAME IN THIS DAY AND
[1:24:34] SAID, "I'LL HAVE A BRIDE."
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PATTERN.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; OH, I love it.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; This message is packed full.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to take our time. We'll
[1:24:51] wait for someone to fall out of the
[1:24:52] rafters. We'll bring him back to life.
[1:24:55] That's our pattern.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; So, when it says, "When do we get
[1:24:59] worried about the clock?"
[1:25:01] I stayed up the other night working on a
[1:25:03] house. Let's work on the spiritual
[1:25:04] house.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; You know the pattern is he's not
[1:25:06] building a wall.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; You got to turn corners.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; You got to turn corners.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; You can't stay where you're at.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; You got to go forward.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you stay where you're at,
[1:25:23] you're going to die.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; That's the pattern. WHY STAY WE HERE?
[1:25:29] I'M TIRED OF GOING AROUND THE MOUNTAIN.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; I hear BABYLON'S CALL, BUT I AIN'T
[1:25:34] LISTENING.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:25:43] You know, here's a pattern.
[1:25:46] Christ is going through the city of Dawn
[1:25:48] and death goes to try to cross his path.
[1:25:51] But he was the resurrection and life.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And that's that that death procession
[1:25:57] COULD NOT CROSS THE PATH.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; The black mamba death is swallowed up.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; The pattern is Jesus Christ is the
[1:26:06] resurrection and life.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And I WHO WAS ONCE DEAD IN SIN AND
[1:26:10] TRESPASS.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; I'M NOW ALIVE IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; THE PATTERN OF DEATH HAS BEEN BROKEN IN
[1:26:16] MY LIFE.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I'VE RECEIVED A
[1:26:21] FORETASTE THAT TELLS ME I'M OUT OF HERE.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M NOT SERVING THE DEAD FLESH
[1:26:28] ANYMORE.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I WAS DEAD IN SIN, BUT NOW I'M ALIVE IN
[1:26:32] CHRIST JESUS. WE GOT TO RECOGNIZE WE'VE
[1:26:35] BEEN REVIVED.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME TO PLAY THE PART
[1:26:38] OF A SINNER?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Why would I stay here?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Tending a grave.
[1:26:48] I wasn't born for this.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Now, it would be so close it would
[1:26:58] deceive the very elect if it was
[1:27:00] possible.
[1:27:01] There's a whole I'm I'm afraid some of
[1:27:03] you who are fortifying yourself in just
[1:27:05] the truth and your intellectual belief
[1:27:06] of the truth would probably be
[1:27:08] confounded by the amount of truth that
[1:27:10] is out there
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; that you could swallow up and envelop
[1:27:15] yourself in and feed on with itchy ears
[1:27:18] till
[1:27:20] the end.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It doesn't have
[1:27:22] transforming power because it doesn't
[1:27:24] fit the pattern.
[1:27:26] God's pattern was to send a prophet with
[1:27:29] the message
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and you either dip with the prophet or
[1:27:33] you're out OF THE PROGRAM.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOD'S PATTERN.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't change.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; So make yourself I told one guy, I said,
[1:27:45] "You must be Malach. You must be Elijah
[1:27:51] because we need one."
[1:27:55] He's like, 'What do we need prophets
[1:27:56] for?' I said, 'Well, you must have made
[1:27:57] yourself one because the Bible says we
[1:27:59] need one.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; You can't change it. It's It's there.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; How many are having a good time in the
[1:28:10] Lord?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I want to lay in there
[1:28:17] because we're the children of pro
[1:28:19] promise.
[1:28:21] And I'm just going to read this because
[1:28:23] I like it. Ezekiel 37.
[1:28:34] Now, this is good.
[1:28:40] Well,
[1:28:42] all right. We're just going to try to be
[1:28:44] faithful.
[1:28:46] You know, there's other patterns. We got
[1:28:47] Abraham and Sarah. We got a lot of
[1:28:49] patterns that we could go in and we
[1:28:51] don't have time. But there's a lot of
[1:28:53] patterns that you should take as a key
[1:28:57] and recognize that God can't change that
[1:29:00] pattern. That that word has to perform
[1:29:03] the same thing in you. Your confidence
[1:29:06] is that the word of God can't return
[1:29:08] void. And as you fortify yourself in the
[1:29:10] word and said, "Yes, this is God. This
[1:29:12] is who God is. This is this is how God
[1:29:14] performs things. This is he can't
[1:29:16] change. This is the way he does it." and
[1:29:19] you recognize your position in the word,
[1:29:21] then you could have faith to believe it
[1:29:22] for you.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; He comes to those who can't help
[1:29:26] themselves.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; I don't even have the will to move.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I don't even have the ability to save
[1:29:36] myself. You're a candidate.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; You're the kind of person my God goes
[1:29:40] to. He takes the people who are dead in
[1:29:42] sin and trespass and brings them to
[1:29:44] life. Why? to bring down that my that
[1:29:47] pious person who just thought they're
[1:29:49] better than everybody else, who thought
[1:29:51] they had just made it on their own
[1:29:53] effort. And he takes the one WHO WASN'T
[1:29:55] EVEN TRYING,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; WASN'T even looking for the truth,
[1:29:59] DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO SERVE GOD.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU BETTER, IF THAT'S YOU, YOU
[1:30:03] BETTER WATCH OUT.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT GOD ON YOUR TRAIL.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; You better just start believing it. I
[1:30:12] was trying to read a scripture. Ezekiel
[1:30:14] 37 1-14.
[1:30:16] And the hand of the Lord was upon me,
[1:30:18] and carried me out of the spirit of the
[1:30:20] Lord, and set me down in the midst of
[1:30:21] the valley, which was full of bones.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; You dead sinner, and caused me to pass
[1:30:27] by them round about, and behold, there
[1:30:29] was very many in the open valley, and
[1:30:32] lo, they were very dry.
[1:30:35] You have no desire to serve God
[1:30:37] whatsoever.
[1:30:39] And he said unto me, "Son of man, can
[1:30:41] these bones live?" And I answered, "Oh
[1:30:44] Lord, thou knowest?" Again he said unto
[1:30:47] me, "Prophesy upon these bones, AND SAY
[1:30:50] UNTO THEM, OH YE DRY BONES, hear the
[1:30:53] word of the Lord. THUS SAITH THE LORD
[1:30:56] UNTO THESE BONES, BEHOLD, I will cause
[1:30:58] breath to enter into you, and ye shall
[1:31:01] live, and I will lay senu upon you, AND
[1:31:04] I WILL BRING UP FLESH UPON YOU, AND I
[1:31:06] WILL COVER YOU WITH SKIN, AND PUT BREATH
[1:31:08] IN YOU, AND YE SHALL LIVE, AND YE SHALL
[1:31:11] KNOW THAT I am the Lord.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; You heard it. COME ON,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; YOU OLD DRY BONES.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You might think that your teenage
[1:31:23] rebellion is bigger than God, but he's
[1:31:24] breathing on you.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; He'll make you live.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And when I beheld, the senus and the
[1:31:37] flesh came upon them, and the skin
[1:31:40] covered them above, and there was no
[1:31:43] breath in them. Then said he unto me,
[1:31:45] "Prophesy unto the wind. Prophesy, said
[1:31:47] a man, and say to the wind, thus sayaith
[1:31:49] the Lord God, come from the four winds,
[1:31:52] O breath, and breathe upon these slain,
[1:31:54] that they may live." So I prophesied as
[1:31:57] he commanded me, and the breath came
[1:31:59] into them, and they lived, and stood up
[1:32:02] upon their feet an exceeding great army.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Prophecy.
[1:32:12] God could have spoke to the bones and
[1:32:14] said, "Rise up." Why would he use the
[1:32:16] office of man?
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; God doesn't use mechanical devices.
[1:32:25] For some reason, he chose to use man.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Matthew
[1:32:35] 28.
[1:32:37] So, we're a product of a spoken word, of
[1:32:41] a prophecy.
[1:32:43] Okay? Your pedigree is just as Jesus
[1:32:47] Christ could look of all the things that
[1:32:49] the scripture spoke of him, your
[1:32:52] pedigree is spoken word prophecy.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You're here because the word said you
[1:33:00] would be here.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; He prophesied a word and fore orained
[1:33:04] you here to receive it. That's why
[1:33:06] you're here. That's the pattern. That's
[1:33:09] the power of a prophetic commission.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm not going to read these. The
[1:33:14] these are the the
[1:33:20] if if you have a a long day tomorrow and
[1:33:22] it's late, you you you won't bother me
[1:33:25] if you leave. But I'm I'm going to just
[1:33:26] try to stick with this. A lot of times I
[1:33:28] just cut it off and shut down. But I'm
[1:33:31] going to just tar with you guys for a
[1:33:33] minute.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:18-20. And Jesus came and
[1:33:36] spake unto them, saying, All power is
[1:33:39] given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go
[1:33:41] ye therefore and teach all nations,
[1:33:44] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1:33:46] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:48] teaching them to observe all things
[1:33:50] whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I
[1:33:54] am with you always, even unto the end of
[1:33:56] the world. Amen. This is known as the
[1:33:58] great commission.
[1:34:01] This is the basis fundamental framing of
[1:34:04] Christianity as we know it.
[1:34:09] You can't get away with the commission.
[1:34:12] This is the pattern of the church that
[1:34:15] Jesus desired that it would find itself
[1:34:17] in the function of. At no time does this
[1:34:23] is this commission not in effect.
[1:34:28] Mark 16:15-18.
[1:34:30] So if you if you want to find and I
[1:34:33] believe this is where our pastor's heart
[1:34:34] was. If you're just looking for the
[1:34:36] basics of knowing where the will of God
[1:34:38] is in your life, this is a very easy
[1:34:40] place to land. If you can't land here,
[1:34:43] then
[1:34:45] you're not you're not in the
[1:34:50] in the economy
[1:34:52] because God wants to use you.
[1:34:55] And he said unto them, "Go ye into all
[1:34:57] the world and preach the gospel. Preach
[1:35:00] the gospel to every creature. He that
[1:35:02] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:35:04] saved. And and he that believeth not
[1:35:07] shall be damned." That's the pattern.
[1:35:10] And these signs shall follow them that
[1:35:12] believe. In my name they shall cast out
[1:35:15] devils. They shall speak with new
[1:35:18] tongues. They shall take up serpents.
[1:35:20] And if they drink deadly things, it it
[1:35:23] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[1:35:25] hands on the sick, and they shall
[1:35:27] recover.
[1:35:29] Luke 24 46:49. And he said unto them,
[1:35:34] "Thus it is written, and thus it
[1:35:36] behooved Christ to suffer and to rise
[1:35:38] from the dead the third day, and that
[1:35:41] repentance and remission of sins should
[1:35:44] be preached in his name among all
[1:35:47] nations, beginning at Jerusalem." and ye
[1:35:50] are the witness of these things. And
[1:35:52] behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:35:54] upon you, but tear ye in the city of
[1:35:57] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:35:59] from on high.
[1:36:02] Now,
[1:36:03] that's the prophecy.
[1:36:07] That's that's the commission.
[1:36:10] He's given it, but they're powerless.
[1:36:14] There's even a point in the when he's
[1:36:16] still there, he breathes upon him and he
[1:36:17] he sends him out. But he was doing it as
[1:36:19] a foreshadowing when he breathed on him.
[1:36:21] The the the Greek words there are
[1:36:23] actually he he's forboding when he
[1:36:25] breathes on him that the Holy Spirit's
[1:36:26] going to come.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; There was a brooding out. There's now
[1:36:30] once the word is spoken, the Holy Spirit
[1:36:32] is commissioned. It has no other. It has
[1:36:35] to now quicken the word and bring it to
[1:36:37] pass.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And that is Acts 2:38.
[1:36:41] this commission. We see it. Then Peter
[1:36:45] said unto them, repent and be baptized
[1:36:48] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:36:50] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:36:52] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:36:54] Ghost. For the promise is unto you and
[1:36:56] your children and all them that are far
[1:36:57] off, even as many as the Lord our God
[1:36:59] shall call.
[1:37:02] That was prophecy fulfilled.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; This is not that these men are not drunk
[1:37:08] as you suppose, but that is that which
[1:37:09] is prophesied by Joel.
[1:37:12] that gospel has not changed.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; But we're going to buckle this down.
[1:37:19] You know, there's there's there's
[1:37:20] patterns. If we looked at it and we
[1:37:23] didn't belabor, but you have the pattern
[1:37:24] now through the churches is the pattern
[1:37:26] of life is cycle and death. Revival and
[1:37:28] death, revival and death, revival and
[1:37:30] death. It reminds me of Shamgar as he
[1:37:32] would sit there. I believe it was him
[1:37:33] who took the Philistines would come
[1:37:35] every year right around harvest time and
[1:37:38] right as when they're going to reap the
[1:37:40] harvest
[1:37:42] the enemy would come in and present
[1:37:45] himself with the the ability to take the
[1:37:48] crop the ability to steal the harvest.
[1:37:52] Saints, this harvest is ours.
[1:37:55] This message has brought us bountiful
[1:37:57] blessings and it's ours. But you have to
[1:38:00] stand up and you HAVE TO SAY, "YOU'RE
[1:38:03] NOT TAKING IT THIS TIME.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Everything this word HAS PROMISED YOU IS
[1:38:08] MINE AND BELONGS TO ME.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to LET YOU COME IN AND
[1:38:12] TAKE MY JOY. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
[1:38:14] TAKE MY PEACE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
[1:38:16] TAKE ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS MESSAGE
[1:38:17] HAS TOLD ME IS MINE. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE MY SHOUT. YOU CAN'T HAVE
[1:38:23] MY JOY. YOU CAN'T HAVE MY BLESSING. YOU
[1:38:26] CAN'T HAVE THE POWER AND THE MOVING OF
[1:38:27] THE HOLY SPIRIT BECAUSE IT'S ALL MINE.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; The message gave it all to me.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; That's the prophecy.
[1:38:36] And I want to now let these words brood
[1:38:38] over you. The magicians could come. This
[1:38:41] is a prophecy that's now spoken out over
[1:38:43] you by the message of this age. And I'm
[1:38:45] going to read it to you and close with
[1:38:48] it.
[1:38:49] One night as I was seeking the Lord, the
[1:38:52] Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen
[1:38:54] and write.
[1:38:56] As I grasped the pen to write, his
[1:38:58] spirit gave me a message for the church.
[1:39:01] I want to bring it to you. It has to do
[1:39:04] with the word and the bride.
[1:39:10] I'm not going to read you the whole
[1:39:11] thing. For those who've read it,
[1:39:16] here is what I'm trying to say to you.
[1:39:18] The law of reproduction is that each
[1:39:22] specy bring forth after his own kind,
[1:39:26] even according to Genesis 1:11. And God
[1:39:30] said, "Let the earth bring forth grass,
[1:39:32] and the herb yielding seed, and the
[1:39:34] fruit tree yielded fruit after his kind,
[1:39:37] whose seed is in itself upon the earth,
[1:39:40] and it was so. Whatsoever life was in
[1:39:43] the seed came forth into a plant and
[1:39:45] thence into fruit. The very same law
[1:39:48] applies to the church today. What
[1:39:51] whatsoever seed started the church will
[1:39:54] come forth and be like the original seed
[1:39:57] because it is the same seed. And in
[1:40:00] these last days, the true bride, Christ
[1:40:03] seed,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; will come to the headstone,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and she will be the super church, a
[1:40:12] super race as she nears him. They and
[1:40:16] the bride will be so much like him that
[1:40:19] they will even be in his very image.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; This is in order to be united with him.
[1:40:28] They will be one. They will be the very
[1:40:30] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:40:33] God. Denominations cannot produce this
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; wrong seed.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; They will produce their creeds and their
[1:40:42] dogmas mixed with the word.
[1:40:46] This mongrealizing brings forth a
[1:40:49] highbred product. The first son, Adam,
[1:40:52] was the spoken seed word of God. He was
[1:40:54] given a bride to reproduce himself. This
[1:40:56] is why the bride was given to him to
[1:40:58] reproduce himself to produce another son
[1:41:00] of God. But she fell. She fell by
[1:41:03] hybridization. She caused him to die.
[1:41:07] The second son Jesus also a spoken word
[1:41:12] spoken seed word of God was given a
[1:41:14] bride like it was Adam. But before he
[1:41:17] could marry her, she also had fallen.
[1:41:20] That's the church ages for those who
[1:41:21] want to go through it. She's like Adam's
[1:41:24] wife was put to the test whether she
[1:41:26] would believe the word of God and live
[1:41:28] or doubt the word and die. She doubted
[1:41:31] it. She left the word. She died. From a
[1:41:34] little group of the true seed of the
[1:41:36] word, God will present Christ
[1:41:40] with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of
[1:41:43] his word. She is a virgin because she
[1:41:46] knows no man creed or dogmas.
[1:41:49] by and through the members of the bride
[1:41:52] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:41:54] of God to be made manifest in the
[1:41:57] virgin. The word of promise came to the
[1:42:00] Virgin Mary but the word of promise was
[1:42:02] he himself to be made manifest. God was
[1:42:07] made manifest. He himself acted at the
[1:42:10] same time fulfilling his own word of
[1:42:12] promise in the virgin. It was the angel
[1:42:15] that had brought her message, but the
[1:42:17] angel's message was the word of God.
[1:42:20] Saints, put yourself there.
[1:42:23] Isaiah 9:6, he fulfilled at that time
[1:42:26] all that was written of him because she
[1:42:28] accepted his word to her. The members of
[1:42:31] the virgin bride will love him and they
[1:42:34] will have his potentials. As he is their
[1:42:37] head and all power belongs to him, they
[1:42:39] are subject to him as he as the members
[1:42:42] of the bodies are subject to our heads.
[1:42:45] Notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:42:47] son. Jesus never did anything until the
[1:42:49] first showed him by the father. John
[1:42:52] 5:19, this harmony is now to exist
[1:42:54] between the groom and his bride. He
[1:42:58] shows her his word of life. She receives
[1:43:02] it.
[1:43:03] She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing
[1:43:06] can harm her, not even death. For if the
[1:43:10] seed be planted, the water will raise it
[1:43:12] up again. Here is the secret of this.
[1:43:16] The word is in the bride,
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; as it was in Mary.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; The bride has the mind of Christ, for
[1:43:23] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:43:26] word. She performs the command of the
[1:43:28] word in his name for she has thus sayeth
[1:43:32] the Lord. Then the word is quickened by
[1:43:35] the spirit and it comes to pass. Like a
[1:43:38] seed that is planted and watered, it
[1:43:41] comes to full harvest serving its
[1:43:43] purpose.
[1:43:45] Those in the bride do only his will. No
[1:43:48] one can make them do otherwise. They are
[1:43:52] they have thus sayith the Lord or keep
[1:43:54] still. They know that it is has to do
[1:43:58] with God in them doing the works
[1:44:02] fulfilling his word.
[1:44:05] He did not complete all his works
[1:44:09] while his earthly ministry. So now he
[1:44:12] works in and through the bride. She
[1:44:16] knows that for it was not yet time for
[1:44:19] him to do certain things that he must
[1:44:22] now do. But he will now fulfill through
[1:44:26] the bride that work which he left for
[1:44:29] this specific time.
[1:44:32] Church, rejoice.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; This is a prophetic word.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; It's speaking of you.
[1:44:40] Are you hearing your name called? Are
[1:44:43] you saying that's me? That's who I am.
[1:44:47] That's my identity.
[1:44:49] I know his voice.
[1:44:52] I know what he wants done. That's who I
[1:44:55] am.
[1:44:57] He spoke it.
[1:44:59] I had no good report to give of myself.
[1:45:03] I couldn't speak these things of me.
[1:45:07] But he's called me his beloved.
[1:45:10] He's called me his bride.
[1:45:13] I'm not turning that into some dirty
[1:45:15] word. He called me his bride.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:45:28] Favor ain't fair.
[1:45:31] What you should just be thankful for is
[1:45:33] that you're the one.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; I can't answer why.
[1:45:39] I can't tell you why. Why me? Doesn't
[1:45:42] make sense.
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:46] I don't deserve it.
[1:45:50] Try to run from it.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; But the grace of God,
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; but not for the grace of God.
[1:45:59] And so, what can I testify to? I don't
[1:46:01] care who you are and how ineligible you
[1:46:05] think you are. The grace of God is
[1:46:07] sufficient for you.
[1:46:10] It may not be in a church service when
[1:46:12] he comes your way.
[1:46:15] Oh my. But he's not limited by these
[1:46:18] four walls.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You could find yourself outside of this
[1:46:22] very service sitting in a car
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; and he could drop by your way
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; and visit you.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; He's not limited
[1:46:36] in your own way. Thank him, church.
[1:46:39] You should be able to say, "This is your
[1:46:40] doing, Lord.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; You spoke this of me.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Your word cannot fail." What are you
[1:46:47] having to do in your praise? You're
[1:46:48] having to cast down your own that line
[1:46:51] vanity, which is yourself.
[1:46:53] You know, false pride tells you that,
[1:46:56] you know, if you're praising him for
[1:46:57] being elect, that that's just you. No.
[1:47:00] No. I'm praising the prophecy.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I'm praising what he said.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I'm praising him for what he's done. I'm
[1:47:08] praising them because I can't produce
[1:47:11] it.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to thank him and I'm going
[1:47:16] to give them the praise.
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; If you could help me sing that as we
[1:47:24] turn it over.
[1:47:26] I know who I am.
[1:47:32] I know who you are.
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:38] The cross of salvation
[1:47:43] was only the star.
[1:47:50] Now I am chosen,
[1:47:55] free and forgiven.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, you have a future.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; I have a future.
[1:48:06] And it's worth the living.
[1:48:11] All singing. Oh, cuz I wasn't made to be
[1:48:16] tending the grave. I was called by name.
[1:48:22] Born and raised back to life again.
[1:48:28] I was
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; your bride.
[1:48:34] Oh, so why would I make a bend in my
[1:48:40] shame when fountain of grace is running
[1:48:45] my way? I
[1:48:48] am yours and I was faithful.
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:57] Know who I am.
[1:49:02] cuz I know who you are.
[1:49:07] The cross of salvation
[1:49:13] was only a star.
[1:49:17] Hallelujah.
[1:49:19] Now I am
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:44] totally
[1:49:46] a grave. I was called by name.
[1:49:51] Born and raised back to life again.
[1:49:56] I was faithful all.
[1:50:05] Why would I make a bed in my shame
[1:50:11] of grace is running my way? I know why.
[1:50:19] that was made.
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:25] Amen.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful
[1:50:31] gospel.
[1:50:34] You know
[1:50:37] Jesus when they went to the upper room,
[1:50:40] he gave them that commission.
[1:50:42] Go into all the world and preach the
[1:50:45] gospel.
[1:50:47] I'm alive.
[1:50:51] I'm raised from the dead.
[1:50:53] And I'm here.
[1:50:56] And he sent his spirit
[1:50:58] and gave them power for one purpose that
[1:51:02] they could prove to the world that Jesus
[1:51:04] Christ was resurrected
[1:51:07] and alive and the same and doing the
[1:51:11] same works.
[1:51:13] And that's what he said. The works that
[1:51:15] I do shall you do also.
[1:51:18] I go unto my father
[1:51:21] to prepare a place for you, but I will
[1:51:23] come again and receive you that where I
[1:51:26] am, you may be also. That's our message.
[1:51:31] That's what we're trying to tell the
[1:51:32] world.
[1:51:34] And that's our part each, like Davey
[1:51:37] said, is to prove that he's alive today.
[1:51:43] And he wants to be alive in each of us.
[1:51:47] And I know because I I I raised him.
[1:51:52] You know what I mean?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; He he wasn't a preacher when he was in
[1:51:56] high school.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't meet God for him.
[1:52:08] I couldn't force rules on them to make
[1:52:12] them live a certain way.
[1:52:16] We told them, "Don't you take that that
[1:52:19] you can drive the van to the football
[1:52:21] game
[1:52:24] two blocks from our house."
[1:52:28] I said, "You drive there and drive
[1:52:31] home."
[1:52:33] Lesie and I are laying in bed and we
[1:52:34] hear sirens.
[1:52:38] I fly out of bed.
[1:52:41] I knew
[1:52:43] I knew something was wrong.
[1:52:46] We jumped in our car,
[1:52:51] drove up on the freeway, and there's our
[1:52:54] van tipped over on the freeway
[1:52:59] with eight football players in it.
[1:53:07] You can't you can't
[1:53:11] teach
[1:53:13] salvation.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; You can only testify to it.
[1:53:20] You can't teach the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:23] Spirit. You've got to demonstrate it.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; It's all there is to it.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; We're here to prove he's the same
[1:53:31] yesterday, today, and forever. And it
[1:53:34] starts in the household of faith right
[1:53:36] here tonight.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; If there's someone sick amongst us,
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; we know he's here
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and we know he's alive and we know he's
[1:53:48] resurrected
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; and he wants to use us to prove that.
[1:53:56] And that's why when we're sick, we come
[1:53:58] up and are prayed for and anointed with
[1:54:02] oil and to say, "He's alive."
[1:54:05] And we're going to stand on his word and
[1:54:08] our testimony that we know he's alive.
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:15] You can't teach that life because it's
[1:54:18] real. It's really a person who's in our
[1:54:22] midst.
[1:54:26] And that's our calling and our
[1:54:28] commission is to prove he's the same
[1:54:32] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:54:35] And the power is attached just like
[1:54:38] today. That's this is a wonderful
[1:54:40] teaching tonight. Really a wonderful
[1:54:43] teaching that this he said that's what
[1:54:45] the church needs. Prophet said it needs
[1:54:48] teachers. need some to take us back
[1:54:50] through the word of God and see it in
[1:54:53] its reality.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; And that's what it's about. It's about
[1:54:58] him in you, Christ in you, the hope of
[1:55:03] glory.
[1:55:04] It's what it's about. And if the same
[1:55:07] spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in
[1:55:10] you, it will also quicken your mortal
[1:55:14] body.
[1:55:17] And you know, teenagers, our kids,
[1:55:22] you know, I mean,
[1:55:24] Dave was no saint and Matthew was no
[1:55:26] saint.
[1:55:28] But when Davey got converted,
[1:55:31] it wasn't by my intellectual teaching.
[1:55:34] He got converted because he meant God.
[1:55:39] And
[1:55:40] he was so on fire for God that he'd wait
[1:55:43] up every night for Matthew to come home.
[1:55:48] And one day he got so mad mad at
[1:55:50] Matthew, he took every single bit of his
[1:55:52] clothing, everything that he had, and he
[1:55:55] put it in a box and he threw him out of
[1:55:57] the house
[1:56:00] because he meant something that was real
[1:56:03] and he couldn't stand it. And you can
[1:56:05] meet something that's real for you.
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:10] It starts tugging at your heart
[1:56:13] and you start knowing you're on the
[1:56:15] outside of it.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You hear about the power of God. You
[1:56:20] hear about the manifestation of the
[1:56:22] spirit. You hear about the moving, the
[1:56:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you know
[1:56:28] inside of you, you're standing on the
[1:56:31] outside of it.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; You know it's real. You feel it. you
[1:56:36] have a a a sense of it, but you just
[1:56:40] know you're on the outside.
[1:56:45] And that's the part you got to play.
[1:56:48] You got to open up.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; And say, I want that
[1:56:54] in me.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Paul said it like this. I'm not ashamed
[1:56:59] of the gospel of Jesus Christ because
[1:57:02] it's the power of God
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; unto salvation.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And young people, teenagers, doesn't
[1:57:11] matter. There's a little bit of part in
[1:57:14] you that you know that there's something
[1:57:17] out here that's God
[1:57:20] that you know is not in here.
[1:57:24] All you have to do is ask.
[1:57:28] All you have to do is get somewhere and
[1:57:30] start praying. Say, "Lord, I want what I
[1:57:33] sense
[1:57:35] that I hear people talk about.
[1:57:38] I want that in me. I want to know for
[1:57:42] me." And I promise you, if you do that,
[1:57:47] in no wise
[1:57:50] will he turn you away.
[1:57:54] And I like this song. says, "I wasn't
[1:57:56] meant to tend a grave."
[1:58:01] And I thought he brought that out good.
[1:58:03] We're going to die.
[1:58:07] And alls I'm doing is tending my grave.
[1:58:10] I'm not going to live like that.
[1:58:14] And you go through hard times as a
[1:58:15] Christian. You backslide as a Christian.
[1:58:18] You fail as a Christian. But there's
[1:58:19] something inside of you says, "I was
[1:58:22] made for more
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; and I am going to overcome and I am
[1:58:26] going to be victorious. Not by my
[1:58:28] strength, not by my might, but by your
[1:58:31] spirit."
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And I need that spirit.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; I need that spirit to get it. I need
[1:58:37] that power
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; from you, Lord, to make the gospel live
[1:58:42] in me.
[1:58:45] And
[1:58:47] I was going to preach on that Sunday
[1:58:49] morning, but
[1:58:51] Davey beat me to it. So, I'll just
[1:58:55] repreach it.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; But it's all about the commission. It's
[1:59:01] all about proving he's alive.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And where is he alive? He's alive in
[1:59:08] here. And then you demonstrate him and
[1:59:11] show him that he's alive out there.
[1:59:15] And then you start winning souls and
[1:59:18] people start getting that spirit and the
[1:59:20] spirit of God starts moving. We're going
[1:59:23] to move up, church.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; But it took the time to get it back to
[1:59:28] where we understood that the power of
[1:59:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:33] attached to the commission.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And when all that gets in order,
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; go prove to the world He's alive.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that and let's just
[1:59:47] let's just bow our heads and in prayer.
[1:59:50] Father, we're going to be dismissed,
[1:59:53] but Father, may the kindling fire
[1:59:57] that we felt this evening,
[2:00:01] knowing that
[2:00:06] you're real. And the whole church was
[2:00:11] built on those men going to that upper
[2:00:14] room,
[2:00:16] knowing that they were commissioned to
[2:00:18] go into all the world and preach the
[2:00:20] gospel. But they said, "You go there
[2:00:23] till you're endued with power on high
[2:00:26] because I'll be with you even in you
[2:00:28] till the end, Father." And they went
[2:00:31] there and your presence came down and
[2:00:34] they knew it was you and they knew you
[2:00:37] were abiding in them. And now they could
[2:00:40] go out and prove to the world that
[2:00:44] you're alive, Father. That commission
[2:00:47] and promises to our children and our
[2:00:50] children's children and them that are
[2:00:53] far off, Father. And let's let that not
[2:00:56] die. I just ask, Father, that you
[2:00:59] reckindle it, that fire, that desire in
[2:01:03] our hearts not to give Satan an inch and
[2:01:07] to take possession of every
[2:01:12] gate that he tries to enter into our
[2:01:14] families, our children, our bodies, our
[2:01:17] minds, our hearts, and our spirits.
[2:01:20] We're going to take the resurrection
[2:01:22] power and stand there with the word of
[2:01:25] God.
[2:01:26] We ask you to grant that to us tonight.
[2:01:29] Father, may you bring great experience
[2:01:33] to each of our children, our teenaged
[2:01:38] boys and girls, our young men and women,
[2:01:42] Father, that are in a world that hates
[2:01:44] them.
[2:01:45] May they step across that wonderful line
[2:01:49] and pass from death into life. We ask it
[2:01:52] in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Let's sing
[2:01:56] that verse. I that when I wasn't made to
[2:01:58] tend a grave.
[2:02:01] Amen. I I like that so much.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Tending a grave. I was called by name.
[2:02:12] Born and raised back to life again.
[2:02:17] I was made from all.
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:25] So why should I make a bed in my shame
[2:02:34] my ways?
[2:02:38] I was
[2:02:41] Oh, let's sing it again. Think about
[2:02:42] that for yourself. I was made for more
[2:02:45] than what I do.
[2:02:48] Be tending a grave. I was called by
[2:02:52] name. Born raised back to life again.
[2:02:59] I was made more.
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:06] So why would I make a bed in my shame
[2:03:11] when a fountain of grace is running my
[2:03:16] way? I know I am yours.
[2:03:20] I was
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Take these words
[2:03:25] to heart. Sing it as you go.
[2:03:29] Pray for Sunday morning. God bless you.
[2:03:31] Go in peace.
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:04:19] me.
