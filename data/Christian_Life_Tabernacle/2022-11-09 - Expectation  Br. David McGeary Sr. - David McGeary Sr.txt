[Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] someone is salvations [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] last night [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] our heavenly father Lord our hearts are enlarged [Music] realization coming to pass if your word is ever so real father we see the world that's turned from you man no longer wishes to retain you in their knowledge they've gone the way of their own device but we're here tonight Lord because we believe in you and we need you and we've come to seek your face we've come to hear from you we've come Lord because we believe that thou art kind and merciful and that you will not forsake us or leave us but you'll stand with us and complete that work which you started we ask you to lift our hearts up we pray in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you be seated just a little bit of where we just share a few things about the word uh it's just seems like you know our meeting has come and and we're here at the time and we're we're just trusting that the Lord will do a lot for us okay we just wanted to ask you a few things uh you probably noticed that everything's pretty uh dirty everywhere with the mud and the rain and everything so we're trying to get that under control and we'd like to try to clean the parking lot up tomorrow so if there's any brothers that can take a couple hours and we have a couple blowers and some brooms and we'll try to clean off the parking lot this parking lot out here uh it's we're going to try to keep it for our visitors for old people and for maybe mothers that have uh children like three and under and so there's only 19 spots but what we would like you to do we would like you to park down the street at the Baptist Church I know a lot of you have been parking on the side streets and some of you been getting tickets you can't park in front of a fire hydrant in Texas you've got to be so many feet from the curb but these streets are dark and I don't really like the idea of people running across central so if it's not too far of a walk you know what I mean if if you think that's difficult I can have some paramedics on standby if you think that two blocks is too much you know but anyway so let's try to do that we've rented the parking lot down the street and so if we could just try to park down there and walk up and the neighbors aren't real happy um but I can't help that so if anybody would do that so we'd like to try to clean up the church tomorrow any brothers that have a time to come over and help and clean and then by the grace of the Lord we're going to start pouring concrete next Monday and maybe in the next few weeks we could have our parking lot in and then that would that would solve that so and then also in in the fact that we are laying concrete we have a lot of Steel to tie a rebar you know and that's where you lay the Steel across and you take a little wire and you twist it together so we need about 20 Brothers to tie rebar so you don't have to be intelligent you know you just have to put a little wire and little we have a little tool that you twist and uh Dan maybe you can come over and show everybody how to tie some rebar you know anyway um it's uh it's not back breaking work but you'll know you'll have a back because so uh we just we just hope maybe some of you will jump in in the next couple weeks and help us one of the things that we're trying to do by doing as much as we can ourselves is to keep our mortgage down so you know we're not where we don't are putting us under a financial uh pressure um I think you've known me for a long time I've never made a lot of pleas for money and I don't preach about money I I just think that when a man's uh born again and he has the spirit of God God's a giver is that right God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son so if you don't have money give your time if if you have money give your time and money you know so one doesn't replace the other so I think we can do this and we're really starting on our way uh it's it's taking form up there so we're real excited about uh doing that so if you could help us tomorrow and then again um I don't know how the deacons correct what preparations they're going to make for visitors I really don't know what we're going to have for visitors because we didn't tell anybody we're having a meeting we can't even seed our own people but if the deacons put some seats out for visitors uh then just uh you know try to help them uh support them and and do what they ask you to do to make their job easier too and then of course the secret is get here a little early and pray and and be seated and then you don't have to be walking in while service is going on you know and be everybody being seated in the song leader trying to lead songs and people strolling in and and all those things and so just do your best if you can to get here early and uh so Friday night it was at seven Saturday morning at 10 Saturday evening at five is that right five and then Sunday morning at 11 and then singing so at six so we just want to talk about those things so let's just talk a little bit about what it means to go into a meeting so let's stand and we'll just read two familiar scriptures we won't keep you long tonight but we we just hope that you all come out encourage people like you know in church that maybe haven't been here in a while or or looked around and maybe you can help somebody get here and see what the Lord can do for us Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1. I'm sure you all have this memorized Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and then also Hebrews 11 and 6 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let us pray Heavenly Father we just asked you to bless us this evening we've come together we're preparing our hearts for a meeting that we're having father we're inviting you to this meeting Lord we want to be prepared to receive you we want to be able to recognize you when you come in our midst we want to understand what a great privilege it is to have your presence and all that it can do for us we ask you to bless us now in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated I think there's a a great word that uh brother Branham used many times in talking about services and and talking about preparation uh for a meeting and he would start many of his campaigns uh on this subject of expectation what it means to have expectation and both these scriptures here is a are is kind of a definition of itself of what expectation is faith is the substance of things hoped for or we could read it like this now Faith is the substance of our expectations the evidence that our expectations are going to come to pass so that's what faith is and then also it says without expectation it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder or he is a answerer of expectations and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now I like uh Webster's uh definition of expectation so we're talking about having a meeting so uh if if we come to a meeting uh and it's just kind of uh I'm just gonna go there and see what's happening well all you'll get is what you see and that can be good or bad just depending on the frame of mind but remember I'm talking about a Revival he said no uh no a preacher brings a Revival in other words he doesn't pack the Revival with him it's the people that bring the Revival and and a Revival isn't adding more members it isn't uh uh uh having a of some form of experience or Enlightenment a Revival means to bring back it means to revive to go back to a former place so if you're in if you're not in a place that you were before then you want to uh uh go back to that place if you were closer to the Lord at one time in your life and you've seemed to have gotten cold or you seem to feel like you're you're a distant I think that's a very common feel for a Christian that there's just the dry times there's times that you feel distanced from the Lord you you it's not that you're evil and it's not that you're doing wrong it's not that there's sin in your life but you just don't feel like it may be the presence of the Lord is there like you would like him to be or you would like to go up to Higher Ground the scripture says that I counsel thee to buy of me a ice have that thou mayest see and and sometimes that's all that it is it's just something that would come and Enlighten us and open us up and let us see that we make a contact uh with the Lord and sometimes that's all that it simply is I believe in them I I know it's true I believe the word of God but I just had I just would like to make a contact I would like to be brought back into a relationship and that's what Revival means it means to restore back and this is the age of restoration and it we know it was the restoration of the word the opening of the seals but it's personally a time that God is spending as much time as he can with his bride he's courting her he's he's taking her to a a a place that he's prepared with her he wants to spend a time with her and when you can look at a meeting that's coming up uh the the Revival starts with the people and it starts with a people that want to spend time with him that's what we're talking about we're not coming to a meeting to be preached at you know we're not coming to a meeting to be entertained but we're coming to a meeting because we've set this side of time so we've we've set aside a time like when you want to give with somebody you you set aside a time you say look Let's uh let's go out to have dinner next Sunday or or how about Friday night I have some time off and you making an appointment and if you set some time aside because do you want to spend some time with this person and so when you're going into this meeting you're coming into the meeting you're you're coming in saying I'm coming to this meeting because we've invited the Lord amen so you've got to invite the Lord remember the people bring the Revival the pit the Revival is is by the people the people that today saying Lord I've invited you to the meeting so because I invited you I've been told that you keep all your appointments because okay if if if if I say this this the next few days Lord I'd like to make contact with you I'm inviting you into my life you know I I just don't want to always worship God at arm's length you know I just don't always want to be saying I know you're up there I know you're up there but I I want I I this is just such a time uh that it's becoming personal it's such a time that the real desire of the real believer's heart is is just to be in fellowship with him it gets a different relationship than it's ever been the church Ages was a great relationship as as the church came up from being totally away from them being in the Dark Ages being under trinitarianism and and dogmas and Creeds and being ruled over by the lady osia and ruled over by the ministry and men with great enticing words and great explanations and knowledge and everything they could keep the people at Bay and they can insert themselves between the Savior and the people like they were a mediator and they always were the people were Forever Learning and never coming to the realization of the truth so the ministry inserted themselves almost as uh as an administrator of the thing but poor we're coming into an age where God doesn't have any middlemen it's him and you amen it's him and you so all we can do is we can we can go to his word and we can say the the word says father that in the scripture Jesus told us that if two or three of us would gather together that he would be in our midst anything with ever faith faith has to have a resting place it has to have something that it settles on something that it holds to it can't Faith doesn't float faith is is unmovable because it's attached itself to something and it's it's greater than a barnacle if you anybody know what a barnacle is okay Barnacle just attaches itself you know what I mean it just and that's what faith does faith attaches itself it it just latches on to it and puts a strangle hold on it but it's got to have something to latch to it's got to have something to hold too and that what that is is the word of God so if if the word of God tells us if the Lord told us if you will gather together two or three of you will gather together I promise you that I'll be there that I'll come into your midst so we're going into the meeting we're not having a meeting just to have a meeting because uh like I said this is for us what it is is us as a body fitted and joined together loving one another being purchased by the blood of the Lamb joined together of Believers in this area for whatever reason that God has brought us together uh we've all heard the eagle cry we've heard the scream of Malachi 4 5 and Luke 17 30 and Revelations 10 7. we we know that it's true we've been attracted to it I didn't call you he called you the the thing that attracted you to the voice was something that he put in you to hear it and so we come together with a common purpose with a common goal you say what is that goal well that goal is to worship Him to to acknowledge Him to spend time with him to hear from him to hear what he has to say to put ourselves aside and give him preeminence so that's what we're doing we're taking a scripture a word that if we'll gather together he'll be there and we're going to latch on to that right so I'm expecting because now the Webster says and I like it expectation is a strong belief that something will happen or will be the case in the future so an expectation is my first expectation is that he'll be here and I want to I want to recognize him because I know he comes in mysterious ways I know his ways are Beyond finding out so I want to prepare my heart I I I want to have a strong belief that he is going to be here and something will happen I'm going to feel the effect of his presence I'm going to feel the effect of his visitation I am going to lay my petition okay at his feet when I get the chance I don't want to be praying far away like we said I don't want to just send a prayer up on a floating letter through space I'm believing because he said so that he'll be here and when he's here I want to talk to him and not only do I want to talk to him I want him to talk to me now I'm an expectation I'm in strong belief that something will happen so you in order to you can't have expectations without you having a vision of what you're expecting otherwise you're walking blind you're not looking for anything in order to be expecting you've got to be looking you've got to be leaving so there's got to be a substance or a reality or something that you're expecting like the woman that touched the Hem of His Garment she was in expectation and strong belief that something will happen when she touched the Hem of His Garment so she had to know what she was expecting to happen before it could be a strong belief now we have some electricians in here they have a pretty good idea if you stand in a wet puddle and concrete Barefoot and you such a hot wire that you're going to get a tremendous religious sensation they know it's going to happen that I mean it's so much so is the expectation of that happening that they make Provisions not to get into that spot well if you could have expectations to the negative how much more is it to have expectations to the positive look I'm going into this knowing that he said he would be here now he's going to hide himself because he hides himself in Simplicity how many know he hides himself he hides himself from what the eyes of the white and prudent and reveals to himself to them such as would learn such as would ask and desire look he's going to be here I know I've got thus saith the Lord his word is thus saith the Lord is that right I'm not prophesying I'm just saying he said God said that settles it he said if two or three people gathered together in my name I'll be there well people always miss them so can you if if if you're you're you're coming into something you've got to be in uh you've got to have a uh you've got to be in strong of expectation but you've got to know what you're expecting else it is an expectation it's wait and see I'm just going to go there and see what happens well you may see it and you may not it may it may slip you by but if you're if you're looking for him and you've you've got a reason you see the expectation is a reason not reasoning but a purpose now I have a purpose in my heart that I I want to recognize his presence I have a purpose in the heart I want I want to get myself out of the way I want to touch from him I want to restore my fellowship with him I want to restore my communion with him I want it back in my life I want leadership back in my life a lot of us believe them but we just haven't made contact with leadership do you know one of the last messages brother Brandon preached to the church was leadership he needs to come back and take leadership of our life maybe you don't have them leading your life we're not condemning somebody but we're providing the opportunity by performing and relying on his word that he'll be here because so when you when you have a vision program said it's like a person that's ill they they're never going to be healed if they don't have an expectation of a healing because they look they know they're healed that's what they're looking for he's a Healer when she reached and touched the Hem of His Garment she had a bloody shield and she knew and she touched the Hem of that garment her expectation was that that would come to an end all she had to do is touch it so she already had an Evidence she knew I'm in it touched the Hem of His Garment people don't try to touch him anymore we used to sing that song Touching Jesus is all that really matters the the church world and the way Satan's presenting himself nowadays is he's trying to always make the believer and the church member and observer and then they put on a show I mean you go to church now that they got light shows and they've got guitar players and they've got singers and they've got a dramatic a speaking and no you say why do you have a speaker because faith comes by what hearing and hearing by the word of God so how does it work the the preacher don't pack the Revival I don't talk to them I don't say no this is what I want you to preach on you know I mean you you I I got this right here you know what I mean I want you to cover O Brother Trey you know he doesn't he doesn't do that I want you to cover oh brother Frank you know and then oh there's sister Susie Q you know what I mean boy she's got a long tongue we don't do that we we're expect Lord to speak to the preacher put something on his heart now Keith comes in and he just starts preaching what's on his heart why is he doing that because he wants to put the word out there because he wants us to be looking for something that we can latch onto that's for me that's the word that's your promise now I've got something I can hold to I can be an expectation I can expect something to happen because you spoke to my heart and the spirit of God the Holy Spirit which is the spirit of Jesus Christ in not in physical form but it's Jesus Christ in spirit form himself his person his personality his nature his attributes walking in our midst in a spiritual realm anointing and blessing and quickening and talking to his children I want to recognize that I'd rather recognize it by Revelation than Feel It by emotion so you can sit right back you can say he's going to speak to me so now to the work now now you've got you've got two witnesses your expectation and him speaking and giving you something to hold on to preaching is an education preaching is him making himself available to you that's what this meeting is it's us getting together providing an opportunity and inviting Jesus into our midst and and he wants to come he loves you he's happy when you're invited and you invite him and you're expecting you can't you get anticipation of of seeing him of him touching you because you getting something that you desire you say what should I he said the desire of your heart so when you have expectation that you you you see yourself on the other side of the circumstance that's what you're expecting I'm expecting that these questions or this empty spot in my heart or this this feeling of being distanced okay I I'm expecting that that the insecurity that I have and and my past and and I hope that you got that message that we felt the Lord put on our heart uh close the book that was him talking to you he knew he was going to come he knew there was a meeting down the road he knew he didn't want your past to hinder you he he wants to give you a fresh invitation just sit down with him and fellowship with him and talk with him and get close to him and have your own personal experience with his spirit that's the Holy Spirit you get that spirit in you the same spirit that quickened Jesus Christ will Quicken your mortal body that's the Holy Ghost he'll be here Jesus will be here in spirit form the holy spirit will be here that's a promise now you've got to have an expectation of what will happen to you when you come in to his presence what would you expect well you know sometimes a real good conviction of sin is a good thing when all the little stuff the little foxes that are spoiling the vine the little weaknesses in everything just rise to the surface then they're on the table you don't feel like they're they're hid anymore you don't feel like like every time you talk with him you got this thing bugging you you know I mean it's all on the table you and him it's all out there hip he brings it out there He he'll reach down and then deal with you and pull it out and and say so he'll he'll say well let's get it out in the surface let's get it out front where we can talk about it and I can forgive you and I could give you the strength to overcome Hallelujah all those things can happen when you're in expectation when you're expecting something to happen because you believe that he's going to be here and you know sometimes we miss them because he comes in such small ways you know the prophet God talked about the little fish in the ocean he said that he said it's like that fish being there and all of a sudden he realizes you know that he's in this great vast ocean and he says you know what I better be real careful of how much water I drink you understand so when you recognize he's here all things are possible the trouble is is that he goes unrecognized he keeps his part of it but nobody has expectation he's going to be there nobody walks through the door expecting to see him nobody is is waiting to see him move they don't have their spiritual antennas on brother Raymond you said call put your spiritual thinking cap on they don't see him speaking to him in the word uh to maybe someone will sing a song and can and boy it's just kind of the song you had or you'll be sitting there and you'll read a scripture and the preacher will come up and read the same scripture and all that stuff goes unnoticed that that's of like the fish oh you know I better be I better be careful but our messenger taught us things that only we can we can get it because we were made to get it he said when you have a teaspoon of that ocean water you've got everything that's in the ocean in that teaspoon so Watch What Happens maybe it's a psalm and it touches your heart and you recognize us that's him don't drink sparingly start pursuing down that line start drinking down that line start pressing yourself pin there where does that channel lead where does that river lead it leads to the ocean oh yeah that's his invite that's that's him reaching out and saying I'm here oh that's when you drop everything you get in tune you start looking for him he he's he's flashed himself by you maybe in a song Maybe in the scripture maybe in something that ignates your heart look past look past the word that spoke look past the veil that it's in look past the preacher and looked at him Look Away to Jesus what do you see you start seeing them he starts to knows he's here your expectation Rises boy something's fixing to happen something's fixing to happen I I'm believing it Lord because this my night is this the time I'm going to be free from this Spirit that'll always bug me is this the time I'm going to get the courage to testify Lord I've been wanting to just tell this person I'm sorry is this the night that that you're going to deal with my heart okay and and you can you can travel a million miles in one Split Second in the presence of the Lord if you're willing to take the journey if you're if you're willing to say whatever it takes Lord I'm ready for whatever it takes I'm ready for a change I'm way I'm ready for a Revival I'm ready for a restoration came ready for a greater commitment I Lord I'd like to be endued with power power's not a bad thing power without character is a bad thing but Power with the love of Christ is Victory we've got power over the devil I think brother Billy and brother Matthew would have been laying that out there for us that expectation that a Believer can have to absolutely finally tell that devil to take a hike oh let me give you the scripture for take a hike get behind me Satan get behind me and there's don't stand in my way you've kept me from making this next step you kept me from a greater Fellowship you've kept me from expressing my love to him can you you instead of me feeding his love and rejoicing in his love and basking in his love every time he comes around all I've got is conviction wouldn't you like to rise above conviction I would I hate feeling dirty all the time you know what I mean I'm going to accept that he wouldn't have reached out to me I I think that he's got expectations of us and he wants to pour his spirit that all his expectations can come true okay so we can just see ourselves on the other side of the victory we can see when that little teaspoon of his presence drops in that a little anointed song that little bead in your heart that little tear that comes down that little holy unction that little quickening and I I don't want to misinterpret this word but but there there is a spiritual sensation not if but a spiritual your spirit is awakened and you feel something come alive in you pursue that get into the spirit invite it to come richer and deeper get lost in it start talking to him expect something to happen do you believe that no if just those of us that are here this evening we come we would create such an atmosphere that our cups would overflow and isn't that really what it were a Christian finally gets to where he's not always praying for himself he knows that God's got him he's restored his Fellowship now they're going to pray for my children can I pray for my grandchildren I'm going to pray that the Revival comes in I'm gonna whatever these clouds are that are hanging on my loved ones Lord you stood on the bow of the boat and said Peace be still and the waves calmed and the clouds went back the prophet of God stood on the mountain and rebuked this storm amen don't you think he can do that what what do you think he can do this weekend I think he can do all things kind of everything's possible but if I don't have an expectation of something I will see nothing alls I'll see is a church service alls I'll see is a
