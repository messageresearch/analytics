I want to just sing that song if um uh let your word be born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; I don't know what key we would try that in, but um it's [music] calling for Eflat. Th those that know the uh the verses, [music] brother Paul Fontaine wrote this song. And so it's I believe he wrote this song and it's just a a wonderful song. We'll try to we'll try to sing this. It was [music] a tiny simple stable [snorts] albe [singing] [singing and music] for a king to be born. He didn't [music and singing] choose some place special to reveal his [music and singing] majesty. So I know if I give him control, he'll be born [music and singing] in me. And the word be [music] in the manger of my heart. [singing] Let it live in me. Let it fall [music] live inside [singing] this house of gra and boldly [music and singing] every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. will [music] outwardly out nothing, not much to behold, but lightly [music] for his word. Let every shield this vessel let him have his way [music] from glory unto the glory. You change me day by day. You let me fall [music] in the manger of my heart. [music] Let it live me. Let it start [music] inside this house of clay and [music and singing] it &gt;&gt; let's all stand as brother Angel comes in the name of [music] our will [music] Another day, a much to [music] behold, my life [music] for you. [music] I'll just shield this vessel. Oh, we let you have your way [singing and music] from glory to glory. You change me day by [music and singing] day. Let your [music] word [singing] be born in the manger of my [singing] heart. [music] Let it live. Let it start [music] with his house every day. Let your word in the manger of God. Amen. So your desire tonight, let your word be born in my heart. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; I don't think there's a greater desire that you could have tonight. Amen. Why don't we just bow [music] our hearts together? Heavenly Father, Lord, here we are once again, [music] Lord, in the house of God, Lord, feeling [music] your presence, Lord, knowing it was you that has called us to this place, Lord. And Lord, we [music] met here believing that you have something for us, Lord. And Father, we recognize our inability, Lord, but we're looking to [music] you because we're a needy people, Lord. And Father, you're [music] you're our heavenly father. And we pray, God, to you. Feed us the bread from heaven tonight, [music] Father. as we just want to yield ourselves, Lord. We ask that you [music] would bless us around your word, Lord, and feed our hungry souls. We commit the needs of your people, Lord, desiring your blessings. So, [music] we commit this from the beginning to the end. Pray in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [music] We certainly appreciate the musicians and the music, the songs. It's created an atmosphere. So grateful for that. How many are happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's uh something we don't want to take for granted because one of these days it's going to be a reality. This is going to be the last time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, while we're here, we know there's some important business that God wants to do in each one of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I [snorts] had this little thought and by the help of the Lord, we won't keep you long, but it was on a thought, word of reconciliation. And we'll turn right to the scripture reading uh in 2 Corinthians chapter 5. You know something brother David said a couple weeks ago, and while you're turning there, I'll just mention this. It's just uh bubbling on my heart. He made this comment. He says, "Know what's influencing you and where it come from." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that's very important aspect of the Christian walk. Amen. What influences me will infect it will affect or it could infect how you influence others. I think that's such an important recognition every day. You know what's influencing me because it's going to affect someone else. Amen. And the little subject that I have on my heart also that's connected with word of reconciliation is under his influence. So the scripture reading that we're taking here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, we'll start with verse 12. For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, but not in heart and not in heart. For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God. Or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. For the love of Christ constrainth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then we all are dead. and that he died for all, that they which live shall not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yay, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation. Amen. We trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may have your seats. We'll also read if you want to turn with me to Isaiah chapter 6. You know, I think that uh if you get a chance, go back and listen to what brother David preached on the battle for influence. I I I was so blessed. I went back and listened to it because, well, I got so much more out of it. But we're just going to try to follow in line with what he preached then and what the brothers had preached. And you know, maybe coming in from a little bit of a different angle. You know, it's the same word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In chapter 6 and verse one, it says this, "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train did fill the temple." Well, I'll just stop right there for a minute because can you imagine? Can you imagine seeing this sight that Isaiah saw? The Lord lifted up high. Oh my. To think what that could do to a person. You know what kind of influence &gt;&gt; that would have on a person. You know, it it can it can do something for you. Above it stood the seraph. And each one had six wings. And with twain he did cover his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto the another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory. And the post of the door moved at the voice of him that crith, and the house was filled with smoke. Then I Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts." My, just to think what that vision did for Isaiah. When he saw the the king of glory lifted high, he it recognized himself a sinner. &gt;&gt; And not only that, but he recognized that he was amongst a people that were unclean. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then flew one of the seraraphin unto unto me, having a live coal in his hands, which he had taken from the tongs off the altar, and laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this had touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is purged. Woo, that' get somebody excited. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean to go from one contrast to the other. &gt;&gt; I mean you think about that when a person comes to a place where they can really see the Lord and repent of their ways and ask, "Well, I'm undone." &gt;&gt; But God can take something &gt;&gt; that would place on your lips and cleanse your iniquity. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, you think about that now. Now you watch what the difference that it made in his life. He said also I heard a voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us? Then said I here am I send me. Oh my I just I just thank God for these examples because you know when you recognize that you know we've been commissioned to go into all the world &gt;&gt; you know this commission is an honor. It's a sacred thing. you know, when when brother David was preaching about the um the grace and the mercy and you know, it's it's it seems like there's a an invitation for an enlistment. Come, come. You know, the world is pulling. They're calling for recruits to fight in their battle, but God is calling recruits for his battle. &gt;&gt; You know, which which kingdom are you going to give your influence to? Which kingdom are you going to be influenced by? There's two spirits that are now in this world today that are asking and crying out, calling out, will you give your opinion? Will you give your uh, you know, whatever uh gift you've been given, whatever time you've been given, whatever resource you've been given, whatever hands that you've been given, whatever eyesight you've been given, wherever the places that you've gone, the experiences you've had, will you put that towards our kingdom? Amen. &gt;&gt; There's influences out there trying to pull you that direction. &gt;&gt; What influences? What is influencing me? And where is that influence coming from? &gt;&gt; You know, there's a time where we recognize, you know, I didn't come to this place on my own. &gt;&gt; You know, it's the call of God. There was a craving in my heart, a desire to know God, &gt;&gt; you know, and I prayed, "Oh God, just like Isaiah, oh God, I woe is me. I don't want to be like this. &gt;&gt; I don't want to live like this. I don't want to talk like this." &gt;&gt; I recognized that I was being influenced by something I didn't want to be bound to anymore. &gt;&gt; But then there was a desire. &gt;&gt; Where was that influencing come from? The inside. Something must have been planted there &gt;&gt; way before I got here. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden that that hunger and that thirst was now starting to influence. I don't really like this too much. This is not really satisfying. This is not scratching the itch. I need something more. &gt;&gt; I can't stand this condition that I'm in. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Well, we just try to relax oursel a little bit. Get out of the way here. Praise the Lord. You know, Brother Brandham said this in a message called testimony, and it's done me so good because, you know, when we're walking in this world as Christians, we want to be battler trained. We want to be equipped because every day there's an enemy that's out to get you. He's got traps. He's a lot smarter than me and you. But we have a word. &gt;&gt; We have a word that exposes the devil in every one of his tricks, every one of his tactics. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says this in testimony says, I'm not a preacher. Anybody knows that. I'm not a preacher. But it's made up in a spiritual form of watching things and seeing things move and forewarning people and things about what's going to come to pass. And it's just it's my makeup. I can't help that no more than you can help your makeup. He says, "But God has put us each one in the body to do a certain thing. And I watch every little move, every objective, every motive because everything is governed by governed by spirit. Amen. There's everything is governed by spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. This is a simple principle, but it goes for everything. &gt;&gt; Everything is governed by spirit, motive, and objective. If whatever you're facing, you can say, "Okay, where where is the motive and objective and the spirit behind this &gt;&gt; in everything?" &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, this church is put here for a purpose. There is a spirit behind this church. Certainly, the spirit behind your home, everything, every behind every building, behind everything, there is a spirit motive and objective. this church comes here [snorts] to greatly exalt some human system or something then its motive is not right. But if you are here to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God, then the motive and objective is both is right. And if the motive if the motives is directed that way, you know, I think it's it's a wonderful time, amen, to consider the influences. What what is motivating? You know, if if you're a young person and you're striving to be somebody in the world and you feel I got to get educated, I got to go to school and I, you know, grind away, but realize there's a motive and an objective behind that. There's a spirit trying to draw you away from the Lord. You know, education is fine, but don't put your trust in it &gt;&gt; because there's no salvation in that. &gt;&gt; There's salvation in the Lord. Amen. back in second Corinthians. I wanted to reread that because that's really where my inspiration lays. You know to think that all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and given to us the ministry of reconciliation. You know when you think about this message, &gt;&gt; this message is Christ. Amen. And when you look and you see that great pillar of fire, you see the the pillar of cloud, you know, I believe we've seen visions in the word of God come to manifestation in this hour. &gt;&gt; It should affect us. It should influence us like it did Isaiah. &gt;&gt; It should absolutely thrust us into a recognition. Who was that up there in that cloud? It was the king of glory. It was absolute authority and power. &gt;&gt; This is what has happened in our day. It should cause us to recognize I'm under the the opaces of redemption. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of full restoration, full authority and power. &gt;&gt; And I got to I got to, you know, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I got to pay bills. I got to keep time. You know, we get to this thing where we're so influenced. But I don't want us to lose the bigger picture. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to get caught off track and be influenced and be earthbounded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just to have our minds so set on the next event or the next, you know, uh, great job opportunity or what this education's going to provide for my future. Well, I want to tell you that the influence of redemption tells you you got a home. You got a future. &gt;&gt; You can put your confidence there. &gt;&gt; He said, "I go to prepare a place for you that where I am, you may be also." &gt;&gt; Well, I want to let that influence me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want that to have full dominion in my life. &gt;&gt; Though I'm going through the struggle. Life's a struggle. You get certain bills paid and then all of a sudden my knee it just is giving out on me. You know, you get to where you know certain situations in the family start leveling off and then all of a sudden here comes another trial. &gt;&gt; Here comes another in issue circumstance. But oh my, just to think that we can be influenced by the redemption claim calling us to perfection here at the end time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what a word of reconciliation that has come in this day to reconcile us to the nature that we were we had in Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He had a sinless nature and he's calling us. He He's saying be reconciled to God. Reconciliation is a process of restoring friendly relations after a conflict by addressing past wrongs, making amends, and building trust, and leading to a harmonious and combatible state. &gt;&gt; Reconciliation. You know, you might not know what it's like to to have a conflict with a loved one. You might not know, but ever you've been through it and you've come on the other side and reconciliation has happened, then you can really know what he's talking about, what Christ really did for us. &gt;&gt; We were gone. We were lost. &gt;&gt; There was an influence that sucked us away from God. It's called sin. And there was a great chasm. But Christ, he bore our shame. And it was by his blood. It was by his to his atonement that he's reconciled us in Christ. &gt;&gt; And now he's giving you the word of reconciliation. &gt;&gt; Oh, you've been empowered today. G. &gt;&gt; You've been given his spirit. And the same reconciliation that transpired with you and God, now he's saying, "I've given you this word of reconciliation. Go out into all the world. Rec. This word of reconciliation is for you to take. &gt;&gt; Go affect your your your world. &gt;&gt; Let this spirit influence you to redeem others &gt;&gt; to this word." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful &gt;&gt; to think that God called you as an individual, a young person, things might be going at school, going ary, and this person's mad at Johnny and Johnny, he threw rocks at uh Frank, and all of a sudden, you're there, and you have the word of reconciliation in your heart. Say, you know what? Hey, you know what? Let's let's let's talk it over. &gt;&gt; You know, you'd be surprised what just a little bit of communication will do. just talk it over. &gt;&gt; You know, he probably didn't mean that. Hey, Johnny, come over here. Hey, Frank. Hey, you remember the last time when we won the the, you know, fifth grade championship football or whatever? Hey, y'all were friends. What happened? Hey, but you know what? This whole thing actually and you talk it over. I don't know all these things, but you know what it's like. You're human. You have human relationships. You have situations in business. Every day the devil's there influencing people's minds. They're going completely insane. &gt;&gt; This world is going completely insane. &gt;&gt; And it's having an effect on our minds. &gt;&gt; But I want to stay anointed with the spirit of redemption. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of reconciliation that come to us &gt;&gt; to give us life to know him is life. My, you know, reconciliation is to end a disagreement or a conflict with somebody and start and the start of a good relationship again. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. It sounds like restoration. &gt;&gt; Well, I love restoration. My Cuz God promised restoration. He said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." you know the canker worm, the palmer worm, you know, the devil has come and thrown different wedges, you know, but God's saying, you know what, be ye reconciled. I've given you power. No, I'm that that person, you know, they, you know, but God has called you, God has called me with the word of reconciliation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I want to be yielded to that influence of the spirit of reconciliation. Amen. Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; It's my desire. Brother Brand, we'll [clears throat] quote Paul here in Ephesians chapter 2. He says this in verse 13. Ephesians chapter 2 and 13. Paul said this. He says, "Now, but now in Christ Jesus, ye were sometimes were a far off, made nigh by the blood of Christ, for he is our peace. He hath made both one and broken down the middle wall petition between us, having abolished in his flesh the eminity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances. For to make in himself of twain one new man, who make peace, and hath he had that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, &gt;&gt; and came and preached peace to you which were a far off, and to them that were nigh. For through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father. Well, I think that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; I think that's wonderful. He slew the immunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we we can walk with a different fresh attitude. We can walk with with with a encouragement. I have the grace and mercy of God that's it's it's reconciled me to God. It's it's broken down the middle wall petition and now I could go face to face with God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the desire of the believer. I want to see God face to face. You know, I don't need a secondhand revelation. I want to go to God. I want God to speak to me. I know that he's broken down the middle wall petition by the blood of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. This facetoface encounter creates an influence. Matter of fact, once you get that face to face encounter, it's an absolute. &gt;&gt; Nobody can take it from you. When you get down on your knees and God speaks to you, his promised word to you, it's an absolute. No one can change that. You can live by it. You can put your heart and soul on it. You can say, "God, I'm not moving from this place. &gt;&gt; This is your promised word, and you made it alive to me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand right here. Nothing else matters. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm governed by that spirit that came &gt;&gt; and spoke to my heart. &gt;&gt; He changed things. &gt;&gt; It influenced me to live different, to talk different, to think different. It's still influencing me. &gt;&gt; It's still perfecting me. I'm still on his will. I'm still on the potter's wheel of his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's not done with us yet. reconciliation, the process of restoring friendship. You know, Abraham was a friend of God. And you know what? When they started, you know, when Abraham did what God said do, he said, "Separate." Then he spoke to him again. &gt;&gt; You know, that's what I want to do. God, you spoke to me about this and this. I know you you're waiting on me to obey your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, reconcile me to your word. I want it. I want it all. &gt;&gt; You know those secrets that of the your future, God can whisper to you just like Abraham because you have a restored friendship by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; You know, it's so amazing by this word of reconciliation. And the prophet can say something as simple as you're being reunited with another nature. Your first nature influenced you to do things that were wrong. Influenced you to do things that were for yourself. Amen. But then you come into a reality where God makes known his nature and his character. And then you say, "Wait a minute. Eternal life, which is the gift of God, is to live for others. You know, my heart's desire is to live for you. &gt;&gt; You know, I serve God by serving you. The only thing that makes me special is that I've received his grace &gt;&gt; is his love. We're the subjects of his love. That's what makes you so special. &gt;&gt; It's his blood that was precious. But he looks at you as more precious. You think of yourself and you think I'm not precious like the blood of Jesus. But I want you to be under the influence of reconciliation. It was for he the joy that was set before him. He was looking at you when he was under that that burden. If there be any other way, &gt;&gt; let this cup pass. &gt;&gt; But you were the object &gt;&gt; of his joy. You were the object of his love. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm going to do it because there's no way for you to be reconciled unless I lay my life down, but I will take it up again." What a wonderful God we have to be reunited with another nature. Brother Brandham said this in invisible union. He said, "No sir, no writing of divorcement. He dies. The nature of the world has to die. Every speck of him has to die. And you have to be reunited again with another nature. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you know tonight that by the reconciliation plan of God's word that you can be reunited with another nature? &gt;&gt; You might be pushing and punching and clawing at it, but you know it's a promise. &gt;&gt; You'll be reunited with another nature. Let the word of reconciliation influence you in you to receive this promise tonight. It's God's promise. God has power to fulfill his word. Amen. Brother Brandham said this. Oh, I love this so much. It just I thank God for reconciliation. He says this in just once more Lord in 60 63 he says now you might be tonight you'll accept that salvation but it's already paid for. The debt has been cleared up and the devil that put you in the pawn shop Jesus came and redeemed you and opened up the doors. Why? Thank God that the doors are open. &gt;&gt; You might think about something that you're facing tonight. Whatever it is, something might come to mind. You're like, I've been dealing with this thing and enough already. I want this to be done. Jesus has opened the door to that &gt;&gt; tonight. He's here &gt;&gt; now. This is the instruction. He says, "The only thing you have to do is walk out &gt;&gt; and claim your liberty." Well, I I I thank God that the word of reconciliation is just that simple. &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Resist the devil and he will flee." &gt;&gt; Right? Before that says, "Submit yourself therefore to God." &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he will flee. This word of reconciliation says if you just walk out on it, if there's something that's harming you in your relationships and you want to feel like, God, I I need reconciliation. &gt;&gt; You walk out on that past and you walk into the future by this word of promise. &gt;&gt; God, your spirit has anointed me. &gt;&gt; You can do like it says even Jesus said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me. You can say that &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord is upon me. The word of reconciliation is in your heart and in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you can claim your God-given right. Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all you have to receive from God that the debt you have the receipt from God that the debt is paid. Jesus said in his last words, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; Every redemptive blessing was completely finished. &gt;&gt; The great wrath on sin. When he became sin for us, it was the debt was settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan has no more power. Only he can bluff with it. If he can bluff you into it, all right, you have to have it. &gt;&gt; But legally, he has no right at all. &gt;&gt; Every power that he has was taken from him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; That's where the price was paid. He is nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; If you want to listen to his bluff, well, all right, but you don't have to. &gt;&gt; You are free tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a word of reconciliation. The devil's been bugging you and bothering you about something. You can take this word of reconciliation. Say, "It was settled at Calvary." &gt;&gt; You're just bluffing me, devil. &gt;&gt; My second Corinthians 5 and we'll read 16- 21 again. I won't be long. I'm trying to be a little bit shorter these days, but you feeling all right, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, henceforth we no more know after the flesh. You know, I think that's something. The scripture says, "Wherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh." Yeah, I know some of these words for me is kind of hard to understand. And I guess with the old English, you know, certain words kind of seem confusing, but the way I'm reading it is just don't know man by the flesh, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You look at a man and you say, "Man, that that guy is tall. That guy is really he uses his arms a lot when he talks or or whatever. That guy, you know, when he talks, he spit in my face or whatever it is." But don't know man after the flesh. &gt;&gt; You see, we want to look behind the veil and see what's motivating him. What is his objective? What's the spirit behind that? &gt;&gt; You know, we don't want to give our time to things that are spirits from the dark world. &gt;&gt; You know, like you shared the gospel with them after they've rejected you, it's time to take your shoes off and get the dust off of them. It's time to take your your your influence somewhere else. &gt;&gt; You know, don't cast your pearls before swine. That's right. This is the word of reconciliation. We want to redeem the time. &gt;&gt; You know Samson had a great secret but he gave that secret. His secret was the word of God. You have the word of reconciliation in your heart. Man, my don't know no man after the flesh. You know, we're called to discern the spirit &gt;&gt; of the man, not the man. Discerning the spirit is what is his objective? What is his motive? What is he trying to accomplish? &gt;&gt; What's influencing you? What are you trying to achieve? What are you trying to accomplish? What am I trying to accomplish? These are all times to take inventory. Our time here on this earth, we can say it's short. It's been said it's like a vapor in the wind. It's here today. It's gone tomorrow. so short that I want to redeem the time. I want to use my influence for the kingdom of God to serve God with joy. &gt;&gt; I've been redeemed. &gt;&gt; We want to have that attitude. You know, I got the word of reconciliation. I'm packing it. It's by the grace and mercy of God. My to think how much power you have inside of you. &gt;&gt; True. It's a sacred virtue. You know, the church of the living God has the ability to impart life. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful. You have that. Just here to stir it up and remind you what our calling is. Amen. We have known Christ after the flesh. Yet now, henceforth know we no more. You know, I think that Paul, you know, when he he says, you know, we've known him in the flesh. Well, he never met him in the flesh, &gt;&gt; he he met him after he returned back to the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But, you know, we know him by revelation. You know, if any one of you, you never I don't know if anybody met Brother Brandham that's in this audience tonight. I haven't met him, &gt;&gt; but my no man know no man after the flesh. It's by revelation that we know him. It's by revelation that this promise of reconciliation is to you. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; My how do you become a new creature by grace? Are you saved? Through faith. He says, "Therefore, if any man be it in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation, to that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. And as though God did in beseech us by you, we pray you in Christstead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made, for he hath made him to be the sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Well, I I think that if there was ever a trade to be made, if there was ever, hey, you got a Porsche, I got a Pinto, or some people probably don't know what a Pinto is, but a Ford Focus. Someone has a Lamborghini and you like that thing. Hey, we're going to make a trade, you know. But what we had was filth, impurity, lawlessness. What what we had the influence of the world and the love of the world. And yet here he was. &gt;&gt; My unrighteousness, your unrighteousness, your sin is become righteousness because of the work of Christ. Amen. Oh, I think that's so wonderful. You know, I think about even Job, you know, speaking of the effect of the vision that Isaiah had. And Job, you know, he went through such a difficulty. There was so many influences that were influencing in his walk with the Lord. And had he known that there was a meeting, had he known that there was a conference between Satan and God, and that he was going to be put to the test, do you realize you're being put to the test every day? The devil knows you better than you know you. He's had 6,000 years to study man, and he's kind of figured you out. He's figured me out. But one thing he can't touch is that soul. because it's been sealed &gt;&gt; until the day of redemption. But he he can access your flesh. He can torment you in your mind for a season. &gt;&gt; Think about Job going through it, you know, one storm after the other. Took his children, took his cattle, took his livelihood, and then took his health. When he's down, he's he's getting low. I just don't know, man. The battle is raging hot. I don't know how much more I can take of this. Then his friends come by supposed to encourage him. They got their influence. Man, Job, you must be doing stuff that's wrong. You must be a secret sinner. What are you doing, man? You're making a shame, a mockery, all you got influence. There's people in your life that got influence, you know, and then his wife comes to him. Hey, Joe, you're looking pretty miserable. Why don't you just curse God and die? What an influence. What a pool. What a test. But Job, in the midst of all that, there was another influence that struck him by the word of Revelation. and he saw the vision of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now I know my I know my redeemer liveth." You You don't think that your trial is any different. Your trial is actually for a purpose. I believe that if we'll let God work through our trials and our difficulties, keep leaning onto him, keep trusting him, the struggle, the conflict, the test, the trial, God's bringing it &gt;&gt; for a word of reconciliation. There's nothing too hard for our God. &gt;&gt; My, what a powerful word of reconciliation. to see that and then say caused him to speak. I know my redeemer liveth. That's what the influence of revelation does. It causes you to speak. You it causes you to do things differently to think different ways. like I'm not holding to this the the light of this world, the candle of this world, the the affections of this world, how much stuff I can accumulate or how easy I can make it or how comfort I could be in this world or how much entertainment I can have is I'm influenced by a king that I saw high and lifted up. Now I want to do like those saraphin they were saying holy, holy, holy. They they were flying with reverence. Amen. Reverence, holy. Oh my. To think that we can do the same thing, you know, and be in action. Isaiah said, "Here am I. Send me." I just feel like the word of reconciliation does that to us as believers. Lord, send me. I want there's people and situations in my family &gt;&gt; in my extended. We're coming into Christmas where we have an opportunity to influence others. &gt;&gt; I want to have the right attitude concerning my call my position. You know, as we travel this road, we got Christ in us. Christ in us can do more than we can by ourselves. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, when you're when you're going to your family event or your work situation, the work having a festival, just you making your state your stand, say, you know, I don't partake in that. God changed my heart. Doesn't have to be a big testimony. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't even say nothing. Just the fact that you don't entertain their jokes or you don't partake in their their dainty morsels in their lavish uh wineries or whatever. You're making your stand. You're showing what's influencing you. Redemption has influenced me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another word for reconciliation. Another meaning is is to restore harmony and trust after conflict or hurt. a joint process involving honest acknowledgement of pain, genuine remorse, accountability, and a shared commitment [music] to changing harmful patterns to build a healthier future, going beyond an apology to actively rebuild the bond. You know, I just tell my family recently, I'm interested in having a deeper fellowship. I'm interested in having a greater connection. You know, that's why we're here on earth as a body of believers. If I can't have deeper connections with my family at home, how are we going to have it in the house of God? &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's just time to to to to to be able to express ourselves in communion to communicate. That's what communion is, &gt;&gt; right? We want to have a heartto-he heart. You know what, brother? You know, when you made that statement, you know, you said thus and thus, you know what? I I tell you after you said that I felt so empowered and so emboldened. I went to this person at my job and I told him the things that you influenced me to say and you know what it changed my whole world. Now I go to work with a joy in my step. You know I had this thought that that person was against me but you know I just went to him and talked to him and it was settled. A word of reconciliation. That's what we have the power to do for one another. We want to influence each other's lives like this. It's simple, but yet it's so hard. &gt;&gt; Just like brother Tom said when he was ministering sometimes, sorry, is hard. But I believe that God, he wants us to do the simple things in life. You know, we know the seals have been revealed and the mysteries. I love that. But let's let it have an effect. Let the vision of all these inspired. We want to live a humble, sweet Christian life. When we're wrong, we want to admit it. We want to go to God and say, "God, give me the boldness. Give me the courage to walk in humility. If I'm wrong, please come to me, please. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to have no trouble at the river. &gt;&gt; We should be able to come to one another in sincerity and say, you know what? This is what happened. And you know what? Did you mean to make me feel little? Did you mean to humiliate me? Did you? We want to have the liberty of the spirit to come to one another and talk it over. &gt;&gt; We're a family of God. We're a body. How are we going to affect those that are out there to come in here if there's fractions? &gt;&gt; How are we going to do it? We need to let the love of Christ constrain us to go to you. I'm sorry. Did I do something to you? I didn't mean to hurt you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're a believer. I'm a believer. It's the grace and mercy of God has brought us TOGETHER SO WE CAN FIGHT TO NOT with each other but against the enemy in our lives in our loved ones. &gt;&gt; We want to see the Holy Ghost empower our children to live an overcoming life. &gt;&gt; To conquer the enemy and the blind, &gt;&gt; you know, forgiveness and reconciliation are not the same thing. You can forgive somebody, but that's not reconciliation. &gt;&gt; Someone's done you wrong, you can forgive them, but it takes another level to have reconciliation. God has given us the word of reconciliation. &gt;&gt; You know, reconciliation takes collaboration. You're going to have to talk. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to talk about things that that hurt. That's not easy. But by his grace, &gt;&gt; by his mercy, I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me. &gt;&gt; You know, if we can't teach by our actions as fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters, if we're not living it, how are our children going to believe us? &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; We got to be partakers of the very fruit that we're talking about. That's what this restoration and reconciliation came to do is to give us his life. My Easter Seal brother Bram says this. What is the Messiah? What is the Messiah? Messiah is anointed one. Now, if he was the Messiah, being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the redeemer and the anointed one and God raised up that body, his bride is the anointed one for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's raised. It's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I thank God for that quote because you know what? There's a lot of curiosity that people have about this quote. But what I want to focus in on is the anointing is to fulfill the word of God &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, the word of reconciliation has come to restore you back to fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; And now God has chosen you to go into all the world and to reconcile the world to Christ. How did God do it to you? How did God do it for you? Was it your good deeds? Was it you feeding the poor? Was it your prayers and different things? No. It was by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the grace of God that came to us. &gt;&gt; I'm a wreck. I was a wreck. &gt;&gt; But I'm in his hands now. &gt;&gt; I've accepted his pure word. &gt;&gt; And now I can go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the word of God. The bride is anointed. The anointed one for this day. Oh my. I thank the Lord for that. Praise the Lord. We're going to try to speed up a little bit here because I want to try to turn a corner. Maybe we won't be but another 15 or 20 minutes. Everybody feeling okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; If we are going to fulfill the word of God to go into the whole world under the influence of his redemption, you know, I think that it's very important. Brother Matthew read this quote and I went and listened to how brother Brandham said it. You know, I think it's important when you listen to a minister preach the word of God, I think that it's important for you to go back &gt;&gt; as you write in the quotes or whatever is if God preached your heart, go listen to how the prophet said because you want to catch the spirit of the messenger because it was Christ. And I'm not saying that brother Matthew didn't say it in the right spirit. It's just a a practice that I do. And I would encourage you to do the same because sometimes we get one another's spirit, &gt;&gt; right? But we want the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; So I went back and I listened to this and I thought my when he said religion is a covering but salvation is liberty is freedom. That's what he said. Freedom. So I went back and listened [clears throat] it for myself. And then I went and listened to it more of it and more of it. And I'm like praise God. You know I thank God for salvation. You know, but salvation, you know, religion covers, but he said salvation uncovers. &gt;&gt; Wow. I don't A lot of us don't want to be uncovered. I know I don't. But that's what salvation does. &gt;&gt; It exposes us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The things that are not like Christ. &gt;&gt; But praise God. This is like a hospital. This is where we come. God, use the instrument in instrumentality of your word. Let your Holy Spirit come and cut those things out of my life. Burn them out because I just want to see Christ reflecting in me. &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus &gt;&gt; in you and me. &gt;&gt; I need God to deal with my heart so I can see him in you &gt;&gt; and me. Amen. In this message called absolute and absolute 63 and 1201 he says now every great achievement is tied to an absolute. You cannot run life without an absolute. Well okay if we're being influenced in the world and there's a lot of spirits a lot of motives and a lot of objectives going everywhere. If you cannot run life without an absolute, this is pretty important. We need an absolute. &gt;&gt; You cannot make an achievement without an absolute [snorts] if it's for it's the final typost. It's the hitchrack at the end of the journey. It's a place where you're tied to something. &gt;&gt; Well, we need this in life. And I, [snorts] you know, the word of God gives us vision. It gives us revelation, gives us overcoming says, but I think as a Christian, we ought to be tied where we know it is right. See, so you got to be tied to something that you know is right, where it's right. &gt;&gt; You know, brother David's question was, "What's influencing you and where did it come from? You know this quote is saying you have to know where we know it's right. Not that we're right per se, but we know is right. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a whole, you know, when you find out you're wrong, all of a sudden sometimes we're like, I'm not even a Christian now. I might as well forget it. No. No. That's not the way it is. This is right. I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Lord, let my heart line up with this word, the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; I know where it's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't run life without an absolute. Amen. You got to be tied to an absolute. He says in 42 he says then when Moses met him in the burning bush then he said I am which remainth the same three yesterday today and forever still the same God and Moses met him in the burning bush. He was that light and when he led the children of Israel out of the wilderness he was the angel of the covenant that Moses by faith saw. He forsook Egypt, esteeming the reproach of Christ's greater greater treasures than of Egypt. By faith, Moses saw that that was Christ, the anointing. Amen. You know, I think that's that was Moses absolute when he came in contact with the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to come in contact with that pillar of fire. You might not see it with your eyes, but you know when you've come into his presence, you are changed. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are new. And for Moses, that event, that transaction, that circumstance where he came into his presence, it become an absolute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where he got his commission here. &gt;&gt; That's where we need to point back to God. It was at that time. From that time, sir, &gt;&gt; that's where I got my commission. &gt;&gt; He anointed me from there. &gt;&gt; GL. I got a job to do. &gt;&gt; He's reconciled me. &gt;&gt; I could point down and say that is an absolute. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've changed. &gt;&gt; My We might sing that. Close the church. &gt;&gt; But praise God, he's made a change in us and we can point back. Now I got an absolute. I didn't do it myself. &gt;&gt; It wasn't like seven steps of this and seven 10 steps of that or 12 steps of this. No, I met him. He changed me &gt;&gt; from that time. I'm under that influence. It's governing me. It's leading me. I got a future. Amen. You know, skip a little bit here. Now, you see, we're not a divided people. We've got to be in unity. Because each one of us is holding a part of God and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in its fullness of it. &gt;&gt; And when his church sets together in heavenly places, then the fullness of the power of God is in his church. Each one of us holding spiritual gifts, spiritual offices coming together brings the pillar of fire back again. Well, that gets me excited. You know, when we all come into this unity of the faith, when we harmonize and there's nothing holding us back, the pillar of fire can come in here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like, I want to see more of the works of God in your life. I I want to see deliverance. I want to see the healings. We've been waiting for the manifestation. We see it. We hear about it. I want to see more of it. And by his grace, we will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now we find that Paul the rest of his life, he had a typost. He had met God face to face and was commissioned by God." That was a typost. What an absolute. And that ends all argument. That's the end of everything for Paul. All strife and everything was gone. Oh my. Do you see how important it is to have an absolute to know that God had met you and from that time? You're under his government. You're under his power. You're in his kingdom. Oh, I think that's wonderful. And it makes you do things when you've got a Christ-C centered life like Paul, you ordinarily wouldn't do. How many can testify to that? There's things that I normally wouldn't do, but because the power of that influence of having an ab absolute, I don't go to these places anymore. What did it? The absolute. The encounter. Amen. Oh my. He straightened me out. What straightening he had to do on me? Oh my. Just think about it. The pro the progression of the believer. &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, when you come to that meeting place, it's not over. &gt;&gt; You're just getting started. &gt;&gt; You're just on the journey. &gt;&gt; You're just starting to travel on. &gt;&gt; Now, he had a purpose in saving me. He had a purpose in saving you. &gt;&gt; And I am determined by his will to do his will. &gt;&gt; My sometimes we get so confused on what's my part, God? Well, you said your word. Now, I'm going to do your will. Amen. Because he's given me the word of reconciliation. I can do this because of what's influencing me, the spirit of God. Amen. Brother Brown said in the message, "What is the Holy Ghost?" He said, "What did he come in you for?" Have you ever asked the question, "What is God coming into you for?" Young brothers, sisters, what does the Holy Ghost come in you for? save you, make you feel good, have joy and peace. Yes, he did. He gave you that. He says, "What did he come in for me? Was to continue the works of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of reconciliation, the works of God want to be continued through you &gt;&gt; more and more. God puts a desire in your heart. You see somebody, you're like, "Ah, my heart's going out to them." What is that? the word of reconciliation. You believe because God did that for you. You God did it for me and he's putting something in my heart. Still small voice saying, "Go reach out to that person." Word of reconciliation influencing you. You know what? God's working on the other end of the line. Just stay faithful. Amen. I always do what is pleasing to my father. I come not to do my own will, but the father that sent me. Amen. That's that's the testimony and the cry of the believer. My we're going to have to skip some of this now in order to keep my word in 15 minutes my you know there's a difference between a Christian and a Holy Ghost fil Christian you know there is you know some people make a claim on Christianity and by their fruits you know them, right? And there was a question asked, well, someone makes a testimony and say they're influenced by God and his kingdom and salvation and things like that, and they're like, is he is he really saved? You might have that question in your heart. Is he really saved? What do what are you saved from? &gt;&gt; You know, your fruits actually show. And so when you see the nominal world, they raise your hand if you believe that Jesus is the Christ and everybody raised their hand. You know, you make okay, next thing is is you profess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, you're saved. Well, if you go off and live like devils, what salvation is that? You know, &gt;&gt; it's like still lying, still cussing, still drinking, smoking, chewing, all those different things. That ain't salvation. &gt;&gt; That's religion. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But I thank God there's a real Holy Ghost baptism &gt;&gt; that cleanses us. We don't have to have a religious act. &gt;&gt; It's a life that's bubbly and like a fountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wanted to leave you with this example and try to close in five minutes. This is an example of being under the spirit that has inspired me and made me weep because I realize how far from it I am. And it's largely because I've been influenced by another kingdom. And you know, thank God that he's given us a thinking man's filter that we can renew our mind day by day. We can go to the storehouse and we can feed and God can give us spiritual food in due season that he can uncover these kind of things that are influencing our actions. But I say I want this word to bring reconciliation of the spirit of Christ so that I can live a closer walk with the Lord and that it can affect you, it can influence you and the world that I come in contact with. Amen. So, I was hanging around. Brother Brandham talks about this uh woman who has a husband that's not a believer, but they were at at the local pub, a bar, and they were hanging around there. And the first thing you know, one night came out up a question about church and about Christians. And one of the old drunks sitting there says, "There ain't no such a thing as a Christians anymore." And there is no such a thing. All a bunch of hypocrites. You know, spirits don't die, you know. So, every time they see you, no doubt the same narrative is going on. And this is out of questions and answers 1964 on August 30th. But he says, "Call themselves Christian. There's no such." One of the drunks raised up and said, "Just a minute. There's one that I know of." &gt;&gt; You know, just thinking about the unbeliever testifying of you. &gt;&gt; You know, you go out there, your influence is so strong that they're testifying of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. That's under the spirit of reconciliation that your life is so declaring to the world that even the world's testifying of the life that's dwelling in you and the fruit of reconciliation is alive and well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "Wait a minute. There's that I know about. Who is that? It's my wife." See, she had become salty and was catching it all the time. And he was catching it all the time. Your labor of love is not in vain. You stay a Christian. You live like a Christian, talk like a Christian, walk like a Christian. Your labor of love is not in vain. God is using you as a witness and an example. Amen. says if he said, "Well, I bet if she's put to the squeeze," he said, "No, she's still a Christian. I'll prove it to you." &gt;&gt; Said, "I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go home and we'll and I'll show you whether she's a real Christian or not." Said, "Let's let's go let's go up home and now let's really be drunk. We're going to act like we're really drunk." Well, when I started reading this quote, I started thinking, man, can you imagine if one of your loved ones come home just was all drunk, carnal mind be like, what are you doing? Don't even come here like that. I mean, &gt;&gt; I I' I've been influenced this religion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get out of here with that nonsense. &gt;&gt; You're all drunk and under the influence of intoxic. You too once were &gt;&gt; like that. Oh my, what a sobriety we should have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I bet if she was put to the squeeze, you know, you're going to be put to the squeeze. People think, well, the world there's going to be a squeeze on the economy and we're being put to the squeeze. You know, there's people watching you. You're going to be put to the squeeze. But just realize there's people watching. And God's using it. He says, "And she set the chairs all and his guest, you know, and tried to make them just as welcome as they could be." Well, huh. Thank you. Thank you, Lord, for renewing my mind because that's not my approach on this matter. I I'm sorry. I just didn't think I would be welcoming that kind of fellowship. But this woman, she had the word of reconciliation. It was in her heart. &gt;&gt; I want you to fix us up some supper. And so they she went to fixing some. We want ham and eggs. He didn't He knowed that they had it. So they fixed up ham and eggs. And when he got to the table, he looked at them and picked them up from the table and slam the stuff on the floor. You know, I don't like eggs like that. Come on, boys. Let's get out of here anyway. Like that. my and they went out and sat down like that and you know she come out and said dear I'm sorry I didn't fix them I'll fix you some more for you my Lord give me that spirit of reconciliation [snorts] &gt;&gt; oh nonsense you know I don't want that that way the first place just carrying on like that. And they went out there and sat down and act like they were all drunk and he heard her in there kind of snubbing to herself. Sing a real low voice. Must Jesus bear the cross alone. All the world go free. There's a cross for everyone. There's a cross for me. This consecrated cross I'll bear till death shall set me free. One drunk looked at the other said, "She's a Christian. &gt;&gt; She's got it." Oh my. And that little that little woman led her husband plus those others to Christ that night. &gt;&gt; See why? See, just a real sweet. Just remember, he knows all about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of the word of reconciliation. Lord bless you as we invite the musicians to come. You know, I'm asking the Lord to soften my heart and as we prepare to turn the service to brother Matthew and maybe we can sing that song if you know it. Soften my heart, oh God. Is that your desire? Have the spirit of Christ lead us to reconciliation. Amen. This is this is every day is Christmas, but we're coming into the season where the world, you know, they have their mind thinking about God. I think it's a great opportunity if we have the word of reconciliation on our heart and let his spirit influence us for somebody else. Amen. Why don't we stand together? Let's have a word of prayer. If the Lord spoke to you something and it's on your heart and you just want to just ask the Lord in your heart, say, "Lord, it's my desire that your word would be fulfilled in my life." You just [music] want to make it known by the uplifting of the hand. And he sees your heart. He knows your desire. [music] Let's go to him together. Father, Lord, we thank you for your eternal word. Lord, we thank you for the life that's in the blood that speaks out and Lord, it's influencing us to better things. Lord, more grace to know, [music] God, more mercy. Lord, I pray God that Lord, as your presence draw [music] near to us, Lord Jesus, that you would, oh God, grant this touch that they're desiring by the uplifting of their hand. And Lord, I ask, oh God, that you would [music] fill us with all your goodness, Lord. We want to be about your business, Lord. And we pray, God, that Lord, in our weakness and our shortcomings, [music] Lord, we cleave to the cross. And may your grace, oh God, give us opportunity [music] to tell others, Lord, how the cross has reconciled us. And Lord, we're not what we ought [music] to be, but we're not what we used to be. And Lord, I just commit the people to you, desiring your richest blessings upon [music] them as we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Let's sing this together. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; soften my heart with your [music] open my eyes to see. [music] Fill me with understanding [music] soften my heart to [music] reason. [music] My heart will open my eyes to see. [music] Fill [singing] me with understanding. Soften [music and singing] my heart to be. And I want [singing] all [music] that you have for [music] me. Jesus [music] and you glory. [music] Open my arms. Open [music] my heart to receive. I want [singing and music] you. &gt;&gt; Don't let my heart be And don't let [music] my heart be let [music] my [singing] heart be [music] soft in [music and singing] the ground. Don't let my heart [music] be. Don't [singing] let my heart [music] be [music] with your spirit. the ground of my heart [music] and I follow that [singing] you have for me. [music] Oh Jesus, tell us all [music] that you for me [music] and [music] open my eyes to standing. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; in my heart to receive. [music] I want all that [music] you have for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want all that he has for me. Amen. And I [music] appreciate that word about being influenced. Amen. I believe that's all our hearts desires. We want to be influenced by [music] the Holy Ghost. Be influenced by the word. You know, as he spoke on the ministry of reconciliation, reconciliation also means atonement. And [music] it's by the blood of Jesus Christ that produces the atonement. We have we have a ministry. And the scripture says, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, [music] we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from [music] all our sins." What a ministry we have, a ministry of atonement. If it wasn't for the message of the hour, where would we be? [music] We'd be in darkness. We'd be lost without a hope. But God sent a ministry [music] of reconciliation, of atonement, which is a purging. It's a cleansing. And that's [music] God's provided way. If we're going to be cleansed, if we're going to be purged, it it it means a restoration, being restored back to favor. That's what the message of the hour was. It was sent to to [music] restore us back to our rightful position. And as our brother ministered about that should have an influence. It should have an effect on our lives. And that story he told there at the end I I I uh was just thinking about that you know there there's an influence by external situation you know you can come into a situation or something like that moment where those those men came home and and they were they were creating an atmosphere and they were creating something that would maybe influence her externally into [music] into a a result or into a decision or to a reaction. But she had she had something else inside of her influencing her. She wasn't going to be influ let let that external influence change the influence that she had on the inside. And I say, Lord, that's what I want. I want I want to be influenced by the Holy Ghost. [music] You know, I and he he mentioned the scripture um resist the devil and you flee, but you got to submit yourself to God. &gt;&gt; And that's a choice. That's a choice. Uh, and I it made me think of, you know, a lot of people submit themselves [music] to the things of the world or they submit themselves and they make a choice [music] to drink alcohol or to do drugs and and I I I couldn't help [music] but think about it, but under the influence [snorts] there. There's a lot of people that are under the influence. [music] They get pulled over because why? They're driving under the influence. And [music] once you've made the decision and you've come under the influence, you're under the influence. You can try that. You can try to fake it, [music] but they got all these sobriety test and they're like, "Sorry, buddy. You're under the influence." [music] And you could try to fake it all you want. And I say, "You know what? If we're so filled with the Holy Ghost, I want to be so under the influence of the Holy Ghost that I'm not faking it. It's in the way that I walk. [music] It's in my reaction. It's in the way that I talk and people can see the the hope that lies within you. Why? Because we're under the influence. [music] It made me think about my brother David's testimony one time. He he uh he was down at the park down the street and he got to reading his Bible and the presence of God came by so so near. He he kicked off his shoes because he was in the presence of of Almighty God and he was weeping and he was there in the presence. He come under the the the influence of that pillar of fire and a cop come on by and he asked him, "Are you drunk?" And he's like, "Well, you know, this isn't that which you suppose, BUT THIS IS THAT WHICH WAS PROMISED." WHY? BECAUSE HE HAD COME UNDER the influence. I say, "Oh, God, I want to be so under the influence of the Holy Ghost, Lord, that it affects [music] my decisions and my actions." And and and not just on on Sunday and Wednesday, but Lord, every day when I wake up, may I make a decision to come under the influence of the message of the hour. come under the influence of that atonement of that blood because what did that atonement do for them children of Israel? They they applied the blood and what did it do? They got their staff in their hand. They got their shoes on their feet and it was time to go on an exodus. [music] Amen. I say that's where we're going. We're under the influence of an exodus. Amen. I I uh just so appreciate the [music] word. Why don't we just say a prayer of dismissal? Ask brother David to come and just pray a prayer of dismissal before we go. [music] Amen. Let's just go before him. Gracious father, we're so thankful for your word tonight. It's [music] truly grabbed our hearts and it's drawn us close to you. And Lord, we in you move and have our being. You're the reason we breathe. You're the reason we rise in the morning, [music] Lord. And those who may not even understand it, it's only your goodness and grace that's influencing their lives. There's not one person that sets on this earth that doesn't benefit from your love and grace, [music] Lord. And may we so declare it to others, Father. Lord, may we be the willing mouthpiece to speak of a grace that found us when we were nothing, Lord. And Lord, built us up when we were broken. And Father, that you were alive and well and ready and able and willing, Lord. And [music] Father, we thank you for our brother Andrew. We ask that you'd bless him, Lord. And Lord, just continue to reveal yourself to him. And Lord, may we be so willing to Lord to be the influence, Lord. And Lord, the power of prayer that we have to come before you and move upon your heart with the petitions that we have. Lord, may we recognize the part we play, Lord, that there's something that you put inside us to declare itself and to give a voice, to give you preeminence. And Lord, may we yield to you that you can move and have your being in us. Lord, there's a an appointed time for all things. May we be watching, waiting, desiring earnestly. Father, [music] for truly your calling and your drawing us unto you, Lord. We just thank [music] you for this time, Father. May you just even now continue to brood over each one. Give us discernment, Father. Give us eyes to see, Lord. May we only be yielded to you. For to you are all things and by you are all things. We love you, Lord. and pray and ask these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Key of F. Amen. Amen. Will give me oil in my lamp to keep me burning. Oh, give me [singing] oil in my lamp. I pray you are dismissed. [music] Well, [singing] give me oil in my lamp to keep me burning, burning, burning. Keep made burning [music and singing] till the break of day. Oh, and we will [music and singing] sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king our king. Sing hosana. Sing [singing and music] hosana. Sing hosana to the king. Oh, and [music and singing] give me joy in my heart to take me crazy. Well, give me joy [music] in my heart. I pray.

It may hurt me till morning. Hallelujah. We will sing hosana. Sing hosana king. [music] Sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king. Take the name of Jesus with you. Maybe there's the key. Take the name [singing] of Jesus [music] with you. Oh child of sorrow [music] come all day everywhere you go. [singing and music] Oh precious name. Oh, how sweet. Hope of earth and joy of [music and singing] heaven. Oh precious name, hold [music] us. Hope of earth and joy of heaven and the name [singing and music] of Jesus with you as a shield from every snare and [music] tempation [singing] drawn to gather. Oh breathe out holy [singing] name and praise. [music] Oh precious day, oh how sweet of earth [music] and joy. Glory. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat.
