Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
August 20th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Aren't you glad we serve a a risen savior tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's just go before him. Lord Jesus, how we are so thankful to be gathered together, Lord, under the revelation of the message of the hour that's been brought to us by a vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5 that we're not in the darkness and the shadows of dark denominations, Lord, but your light has risen upon the bride and called us out of the tombstones of denominations, Lord. And you've set us upon a strong rock of revelation, Lord. What an exciting time to be living in the climax of the hour of the catching away of your bride. Lord, we know this is just one step closer to the great catching away. So Lord, we are just so thankful to be here. We thank you for the songs and the worship and all those that have come. We remember those that aren't able to make it. Lord, pray that you'd be their portion. But now, Father, as we turn to the the word, we just pray that you'd come, Father, and do what only you can do and take your word and break the bread of life and feed your people. I pray we just love you, Lord. We surrender to you the best that we know how. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, let's just turn in Isaiah 60. My just a wonderful atmosphere and presence here. It's just so good to have the opportunity. Amen. You know, I was away uh just preaching at brother uh Matt Morris's church there and and you know, it kind of struck me while we were having church. I said to, you know, why don't we act like this might be the last service we ever have? &gt;&gt; You know, my could you imagine if we came with that kind of expectation and just kind of said, you know what, if if this is going to be it, I'm going to let I'm going to let people know whose side I'm on. I'm going to let my brothers and sisters know that I believe this is the church. Look, if if this is my last opportunity, Amen. I'm going to Amen. I'm going to give it my all. I say, that's how we ought to live for Jesus Christ. You know, uh we ought to be living like he he he's coming right now. you know, he's coming in the morning and and we need to redeem the time. And sometimes it's so easy to get under the load and the pressure of of of the age that we're living in. We kind of lose sight. But it's it's good to be reminded of those things because hey, it could be, &gt;&gt; this could be the night. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow morning could be the the morning. &gt;&gt; I say even so, come Lord Jesus. Isaiah 60 and verse one. Arise, shine, for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord has risen upon thee. We pray a blessing on the reading of the word. You may have your seats. If you'll also turn on over with me into John chapter 8, maybe we'll just um read the first uh 12 verses here. And I um would be taking a a text also from verse 12. But I I love how this story is the story that's right before that says, "And Jesus went to Mount Olives, and early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught them. And they say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act." Now if if you know the uh Levitical law and the the law of Moses, this is not a good place to be. Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. But what sayest thou? &gt;&gt; This they said, tempting him that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down with his finger, wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. You know, sometimes that's what you got to do. &gt;&gt; So when they continued asking him, he lifted up and he said unto them, "He that is without sin among you, let him cast &gt;&gt; a stone at her." And again he stooped down and he wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, saw none but the woman. He said unto her,"Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?" She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light &gt;&gt; of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, &gt;&gt; but shall have the light of light. Brother Brandon would say in shalom, he would say that son is the word of God. In the beginning, God said, "Let there be light." When the manifested word of God, when the word of God was manifested, there was light. First, God spoke it. What if it didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. But when he spoke it and then it was manifested, vindicated. His word was a vindicated light come into existence. And that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated. &gt;&gt; Now just just let's don't move through this too quickly. That's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated. God's written word vindicated. Then it shows light. It's a portion is lit or put out of each age. And we find it in the church ages. We find it in the Old Testament church ages. Each time that there come a time for a certain manifestation of the journey. Now we are in a certain manifestation of the journey. And it come time for a certain manifestation of the journey. There was a prophet come to the earth and the word came to the prophet and he made that word live. And when that word was identified, it reflected God. And there was the age. There was the light. And that's the way light comes today. And with the help of God, I'd like to minister to you this evening on the way light comes today. You know, the word came to the prophet and he made that word live &gt;&gt; and it was the light to the age. And I want to say as we receive that word and that word is identified in us, it is light. &gt;&gt; It it illuminates our soul. It it it illuminates our life and our decision and in our path and a and you know once we were groping in darkness and didn't know which way to go. But then when the vindicated word it comes and identifies that seed and and something is quickened and made alive and and now that very word is identified in you. It's taken away the confusion and the darkness. You're not wondering, "Do I need to turn left or right?" But your eyes are set straight on Calvary and and you're walking onward, Christian soldiers, and and you know where you come from and and you know where you're going and even when the enemy would throw trials and tribulations and things would come upon you. You know, there might be discouragement and things, but oh, if there's a revelation down on the soul, we we we know where we're going. We're not confused. We're not wandering in darkness because we've been illuminated that the light has come. It it shined into the darkness and a and we were once alienated from God and and we were in sin and trespasses but now we are quickened. Aren't you thankful for the quickening power of almighty God? Amen. That he would come and quicken the seed. And in Ephesians was saying he hath quickened uh raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And Jesus would say in Matthew 5:14, he'd say, "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid." And and I just want to say that you are the new Jerusalem. You are that city. Uh you are that city on Mount Zion. And you have been set on a hill. You have been set on a rock of revelation. God has lifted you up out of the dark denominations and tombstones of Lady Osia. And he has set you upon a strong rock of revelation. And you are that city. You are that city of Zion that is set up on a hill. Oh, let your light shine. &gt;&gt; We've been lifted up. We've been raised up out of the dead. And now I just want to say that we know where we are standing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to presume. We don't have to wonder. We we don't h are we in this age? Are we in that age? Is there coming another message? No. We are right at the final climax. We've received our last sign. We've received the anointed word, our Messiah, and now it's being quickened in the bride. And soon and very soon, we will be changed. &gt;&gt; Verse 16 would say, "Let your light so shine before men." &gt;&gt; That they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. I want to say, don't hide your revelation. Satan's always want to offer a bushel basket or something to occupy you or or or or to keep you tied up and too busy. But I want to say we ought not hide this great revelation that which was freely given. I say freely give. There ought to be something inside of the believer. Oh, that we we're shining forth a light into a dark generation that they might see your good works and glorify God. &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to focus on a portion of that quote there. He says, "But when he spoke it and then it was manifested, vindicated, his word was a vindicated light come into existence." And that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated. God's written word vindicated, then it shows light. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say the word manifested in you is light. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour in you is the vindication of what was spoken. &gt;&gt; You see, just like it was in the beginning, he said, "Let there be light." But there that no one knew what the what that was going to be until it came into existence. And I want to say a prophet has stood on the earth declaring there's coming a bride. There's coming an invincible army. Uh there's one that's rising up. I can stand here and I can say I'm beholding the very words that was spoken. You are that bride. &gt;&gt; Well, that ought to make you excited. &gt;&gt; You ought to rejoice that you are the very vindication of the word. You are the very vindication of the message of the hour. He said there would be a bride and here she is. &gt;&gt; The word manifested in you is light. And it's a v vindication of the word. Look, I I I don't have to I don't have to wonder, you know, if I got a house down the street. &gt;&gt; I know I got a house down the street. &gt;&gt; You want to know how I know I come from there? &gt;&gt; I come from that house. &gt;&gt; Look, I I I don't have to wonder where I'm going because I come from there. &gt;&gt; I came from glory and I'm going back to glory. I don't have to wonder if God's a healer because I've been healed. I don't have to wonder if he's a deliverer cuz I've been delivered. I don't have to wonder if he's a savior cuz I've been saved. I don't have to wonder if he quickens because I've been quickened. I don't wonder have to wonder if he changes a lie because I've been changed. &gt;&gt; I'm not wondering. I'm not beat down. I I'm not under traditions of man's and and man's ideas. I'm not wondering if I've I've been run over here and I've been run over there. I'm not over here wondering. No, I know whom I believed in &gt;&gt; and I'm persuaded. Let your light so shine before men. &gt;&gt; That they may see your good works. I say, Lord, help us in that department. James 2:20 would say like this, "But wilt thou know, oh vain man, that faith without works is dead?" Brother Brandham said, "If you don't have words with your faith, it shows you haven't got faith. You're just talking from your mouth. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that do a lot of talking. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that run their mouth. There's a lot of people that quote the prophet. They say, "Brother Brandham said, Brother Brandham said, but where is the life? Where is the fruit? Where is that Holy Spirit? Where is that quickening power? Where is that ability to be Christ to an individual that could come to an individual that's in a need? They're in darkness. They need deliverance. They need light to shine into the ground. Where is that light? It ought to be in you. It ought to be in you. It ought to be in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might fool men. &gt;&gt; But you are not going to fool God. Well, did Isaiah the prophet say, "You honor me with your lips, &gt;&gt; but your heart is far from me?" &gt;&gt; So many want to just say they believe in Jesus Christ. Many want to say they believe the message may be within certain realms. What? Just to take away the approach, &gt;&gt; just to fit in. &gt;&gt; But what about the life? What about your works? What about your private time? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I just it strikes me that this family one time they had a a several children, you know, and and each one of them kept going into the Navy and and one by one they kept going into the Navy and they couldn't understand it. They said, "There's nobody in our family that was in the Navy. Why has each one of my boys each one gone into the Navy?" And and after researching and doing some study, they realized that every night in their bedroom, they laid on that bed and there on their wall was a picture of a Navy ship. And they started to set their affection on that. Something in them started working and it created a desire, an ability in them. Oh, I say set your affections on things above and not on the earth. If you're looking for a better job and all these things and it's all you ever think about, then sure, you might go right into it. But I say, let's lift up the message of the hour. Let's lift up a message of vindicated word that we have received. Let's set our affections on things that are above. says this further in shalom. The world is one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in and yet is standing in again the most blessed light that ever did shine. And the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness. And I believe that we are now living in that hour again &gt;&gt; that when God is separating the light from the darkness &gt;&gt; and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest. The prophet said that God took that great chaos and and darkness and and everything that was all over the the world the world and and there was all this just doom and gloom and it it seemed like what is what is this creation? What is this lifeless form just hanging out there in eternity? What's the purpose? But God by his word took that chaos and he transformed it into a garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; And he said, "We're now living in that hour again. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness." &gt;&gt; Oh, but I want to say that the spirit of God is moving upon your life. &gt;&gt; The the message of the hour is is is bringing light and life upon your life by the spoken word. And and it's driving away the darkness. It's driving away the confusion and all of those things that all the questions and and everything that you had there arise and shine. The glory of the Lord has risen upon you. &gt;&gt; Just trying to pace oursel through here our text. It says, "I am the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He that followth me shall not walk in darkness." &gt;&gt; Look, I I say we we have such an opportunity right now. I I don't know where you've been living. I I don't know where you've been and and I don't know how difficult or undeical, but I want to say there is a message. There is a word right now that if you'll follow that word, you can follow it right out of the darkness. You can follow it right out of the unbelief, right out of the confusion, right out of the torment. I don't care what the devils is. I don't care what the darkness is. There is a light that is shining forth right now. And you can walk away from your prison. You can walk away from your bondage. You can walk away from your fear. You can walk away from it all. And I say if you follow the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; oh sure, we can lay hands on you. We can pray for you. We have a divine commission to cast out evil spirits. &gt;&gt; But that spirit will just wander. &gt;&gt; And if you don't get that that Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; your estate will be worse than the first. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to pray for deliverance. I've seen a lot of people that wanted to be delivered, but they didn't want to be healed. &gt;&gt; Pastor, fix my life. Fix my marriage. &gt;&gt; Why are you ready to make a surrender? Well, that's not the problem. I like my entertainment. I I like the way that I'm living. I I like to be a part-time Christian, but take away the reproach. Take away the bondage. Take away the hurt. Oh, there got to come a place where you're ready to to to to die out locked, shock, and barrel and say, "If I lose my friends, if I lose my family, if I lose it all, I don't care. Oh, God, I need deliverance. And if I don't get the Holy Ghost at this altar tonight, you'll find a pile of bones right here." And I tell you, when you get down to business, God will meet you in your time of need. &gt;&gt; Let's don't be borderline believers. So many people come so far. God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; But what did he send a prophet for? &gt;&gt; So many people recognized that John was a prophet. &gt;&gt; But they never recognized his message. &gt;&gt; John was the light of the day. And Jesus said, "Oh, John was a burning light and you rejoiced in his season." &gt;&gt; But then came the time, "Hear ye him. I say, let's go all the way into the promised land. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the adoption of sons. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of manifested sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You do not have to stop short. There is no man, no bishop, no church that can tell you you can only go so high &gt;&gt; because a vindicated prophet has come and taken the limits off. that there is no ceiling to this message. There is no ceiling to say you can only go so high. I want to say if you can believe it, you can have it. All things are possible to them that believe. If you need an arm restored, you can have an arm. If you need a baby, you can have a baby. If you need your health, you can have your health. If you need your prodical sons and your prodical daughters, I say speak to the mountain. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the fullness of dominion. Go ahead and point to my faults and point to my failures. I'll point to a bleeding, bloody sacrifice that hung there on Calvary and nailed all of my sins and my faults. &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's get the condemnation off of the bride. You can do the greater works. &gt;&gt; The Psalms say in 119, thy word is a lamp &gt;&gt; unto my feet &gt;&gt; and a light unto my path. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said it lights the path of every believer into his presence. I say what ought Christians ought we ought to be. &gt;&gt; What kind of light should be shining? &gt;&gt; What kind of work should we have? &gt;&gt; Prophet said in the papist vision he said everywhere those early believers went. They went preaching the gospel word and God confirmed that word with signs following. The sick were healed. The devils cast out and they spoke in new tongues. &gt;&gt; That was the word in action. That word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last stage. &gt;&gt; It is here stronger and greater than it ever was &gt;&gt; in the true word bride. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad &gt;&gt; that I can say &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I said I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. True word believers with signs and wonders are following. Why? Because we preach the word and the believers believe and we get the results. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I am the bride of Jesus Christ. I am an overcomer. I can do the greater works. I am going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about you, but have you ever been called bad names? You're a failure. You can't make it. You ain't the bride. You ain't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You'll never be good enough. You're foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; You fell again yesterday. You'll never make it. You'll never get total victory. Well, I do not want to sound like the devil. &gt;&gt; Devil, shut up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Arise &gt;&gt; and shine. &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord is risen upon you. &gt;&gt; Why are you listening to all that name calling anyways? &gt;&gt; Why you stick around for it? &gt;&gt; Do you like hearing it or does it justify your loose living? &gt;&gt; Well, I can't overcome so I might as well smoke. I can't overcome. I might as well lust. Maybe I am foolish. I'll never get total victory. I might as well watch the movies. I might as well enjoy the entertainment. Well, if I'm predestinated, oh, I say you ought to start saying what the word said about you. Quit listening to the devil. Quit listening to the carnivine and listen to a vindicated word. Listen to Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, Revelations 10 1-7 who said, "You are justified. You never get it in the first place. You are standing the virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. You are perfect. &gt;&gt; That ought to create a faith in you to speak a mountain into existence. &gt;&gt; We ain't baby fashion. &gt;&gt; I ain't looking for a funny feeling. I ain't looking for some fantastic and oil in the hands. I'm looking for the manifested word. I'm looking for a first one that come into maturity. A son of God with all the fruits of the spirit, had the humility. He He had the the the right attitude. He had the right walk. &gt;&gt; We want all the big stuff. We want all the big fantastic. But what about down in the valley &gt;&gt; when the tough gets going? Well, if that's just the way it is, I'm just going to watch a movie. If that's just the way it is, I'll just do this, man. Quit babying your flesh. &gt;&gt; Look, if music's got a hold of your life, why don't you get Why don't you do battle? &gt;&gt; You know, we got people that are sitting amongst us, good believers, believing they've received the Holy Ghost, and they're struggling with worldly music. Don't keep living like that. &gt;&gt; The light is here to shine into that darkness. &gt;&gt; Look, if you haven't been able to handle yourself, get some help. &gt;&gt; Get your pastor. Get a man of God. We got a divine commission. Let's do battle. &gt;&gt; Satan, you've been exposed. &gt;&gt; You've been tormenting a daughter or a son of God, and they don't want to listen to that Tommy ride anymore. I rebuke that devil and that spirit. Come away from her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost come in into that place. Fill that heart. &gt;&gt; Are you one of them tonight? &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Well, brother, you know, I don't see the word in action." Brother Brandham said that the evening light, he said that the evening light can't be anything but back to acts again. It was to restore the faith. &gt;&gt; And I maybe maybe we do a little checkup tonight and you say, "Well, I don't see the word in action in my life." Or, "I want the light to shine brighter." Is there anybody here that can identify with that? &gt;&gt; Paul would say this. He would say, "Be angry." Ephesians 4:26, he says, "Be angry and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath. If you have something that has not been made right, never lay down and go to bed without making that right. &gt;&gt; You are not guaranteed tomorrow. I say if there's something I don't know about you, but praise God, he made me this way, but I I just can't hardly I can't stand to have something there nagging. I can't stand for there to be something left undone. I can't stand there to be something ain't there. It's something inside me. I just got to make that right. And there's things in the church and in our marriages and our family and with our kids and and and and things we got to make right, church. &gt;&gt; And God forbid we're taking communion &gt;&gt; and we got those things laying there. I say, "Oh, don't be angry and sin not. Let not the sun go down about your upon your wrath. Neither give place to the devil. Give no place. Give no room. Give no opportunity. Give no place to the devil. That's usually the problem is we make room for him. &gt;&gt; You know, he starts badmouthing you. Say, "Well, pull up a chair." &gt;&gt; You're right. I failed yesterday. Go ahead. Tell me how what's what a loser I am. Do not give any place to that. &gt;&gt; Don't give any room to the devil. &gt;&gt; No room. &gt;&gt; Well, I say, "Lord, may I just get so full of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Fill my mouth. Fill my heart. Fill F feel every fiber of my being where there is just no room. &gt;&gt; Or do you do you like the world? Do you like to have a little room for for for the flesh? I say give no place to the devil. &gt;&gt; Hold on to that word. Fill your mouth and your heart with it. &gt;&gt; I like how the prophet of God said this. He said, "A real way to testify is not in the church. It's out in dark places." I'll just read this. &gt;&gt; It's out in dark places. Let your light shine where it's dark. Go to the road houses and different places and where sin and things is heaping. Then let your light shine. &gt;&gt; There is the place to do it. &gt;&gt; Look, this this book isn't going to walk off the pulpit and go to your job. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; But it's in a book. It's not going to get up and walk out and go to your place of work. What do you got to do? You got to take this book. You got to eat this book &gt;&gt; and you got to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; And this word that has been spoken has to become manifested in you. And then you become the light to the world. &gt;&gt; You are epistles written and read of all men. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Peace. The glory of the Lord has risen upon you. I don't know if you've looked out there, but has anybody looked out there in the world? It's pretty dark. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's it's ugly. &gt;&gt; It's terrible. There's insanity everywhere. &gt;&gt; But in the midst of all that, there is a people. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. The glory of the Lord has risen upon you. Now Jesus would say this and we're just trying to work towards &gt;&gt; the way life comes today. He said Jesus in five Matthew 5:13 he said ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost its savor if it's lost its testimony if it's lost its effect or its ability it can't cure. It can't help. It can't heal. It can't illuminate. Do do you want to be the light of the world? &gt;&gt; Do you want to be able to impart eternal life? &gt;&gt; Do you want to be able to go into those dark places and let your light shine? Brother Brandham said, "Let our lives be so salty that others can watch the way we act and live that they'll want to live that way, too." &gt;&gt; How are we ever going to do it? We got to start setting our affections on things that are above. Forgetting those things that are in the past, &gt;&gt; good and bad. &gt;&gt; I'm glad you got a good track record and I'm glad you gone to church for 30 years. But I say what? Let's forget those things that are in the past and let's press toward the mark of the high calling of Jesus Christ. Look, it's home time. It's time to go in a rapture. It's time to go in a body change. I say we ought to be like Rahab. Let's get everybody we can under the token. Judgment is coming. It's all about to be tore down. This world is ripe for judgment and to be burned up. I say, let's get everybody in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Paul would say, "Are you so foolish having begun in the spirit? Are you now made perfect in the flesh?" I think that's so many times where we get ourselves in trouble. We we get going good for a little bit and a while, maybe we get a little bit of revelation and we feel good. We've done a little bit of reading Bible and going to church and then we just go on cruise control. I'm doing pretty good now, Brother Billy. I've been going to church. I've been reading my Bible. I'm doing all right now. I can just kind of I can just update with the news and I can kind of just chat with the friends and I can update and see where the old friends are and everything. And all of a sudden, you get walloped right upside the head and you get knocked down flat and you wonder why how in the world did that ever happen? Are you so foolish having begun in this in in the spirit? Are you now perfected in the flesh? And I'll just take that up a notch. Look, it it ain't going to be by your good works. You ain't going to earn your salvation. You ain't going to earn yourself into a rapture. No, we need to be led by the spirit of God. Those that are the sons of God, they are led by the spirit of God. We ought to be in fervent prayer. We got to have a prayer life. We got to be seeking God. We got to be praying for revelation. We got to be praying for our brothers and sisters. We got to pray for our pastor. Pray for the church. Pray for our lives. Pray for our jobs. Pray for our families. Galatians 5:16 says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; I say keep the light on. &gt;&gt; You wonder why the darkness is creeping in. Have you let the light go out? You know, I've been feeding the fire. You know how it is. You can build a humongous bonfire. I mean, we've done it here at the church. My I mean, we we we're able to get a lot of wood from someplace and there's just no no limit to it. And you can stack that thing up and build a fire 30t high and 30 feet wide. But guess what? If you quit throwing wood on it, I don't care how fire how bright and big that fire is, it's going to get smaller, smaller, and smaller until it's just some ambers. And you wonder, "Brother David, why is my fire going out?" Well, I mean, I Well, you've been you've been reading. You've been praying. When's the last time you listened to a tape? Well, the last time you played it in church. Oh, I don't know about you, a car doesn't get very far down the road without gas. &gt;&gt; And this bride ain't getting very high without the message of the hour. You got to take this word and you got to eat it up. &gt;&gt; Take what the five-fold ministry for the edifying and the perfecting of the saints and eat it up. &gt;&gt; We are the final voice to the final generation under our messenger. &gt;&gt; Keep the light on. Do those works that you know. I mean we we we give no place to the devil. &gt;&gt; If you need to testify, call me. I love a good testimony. &gt;&gt; Tell somebody. I don't know if you if anybody if you ever feeling down and out and you feel like something's wrong, just testify. Just sing a song. Do something. &gt;&gt; Give no place to the devil. If you start feeling gloomy and everything, look, we got to have some spiritual awareness in the church. We got to start recognize we're in a battle. We're in a fight. Why is this little gloom in the house? Why are the kids unsettled? Why is the wife unsettled? We let's let's get some spiritual awareness. Let's get discern some discernment in our homes and in our lives and in our job and start realizing I'm in a battle. &gt;&gt; You know that 200,000,000 demons were loosed at the river Euphrates and they are attacking those Jews through uh through Iikman and Stalin and Hitler. But now those spirits have turned what? And been loosed on the bride. &gt;&gt; And and you wonder why it's hard to pray. You wonder why you're having such a hard time at work. &gt;&gt; We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this in shalom. &gt;&gt; He says, "I've come to the spot. I believe that people don't know what they're doing." It comes to the time to where the human being has look like become such a subject to evil until it's a pathetic thing. seems like there's a shadow of darkness just over the people that presses them. And and you see how this gross darkness is pressing people to to drugs and alcohol and and substitutes and and insanity and and people are losing their minds as prophesied 60 years ago that if this thing goes another 50 60 years there'll be total insanity. We are witnessing total insanity upon civilization. People have lost their mind and they've lost common sense and reason and mamas and daddies don't even know how to be mamas and daddies anymore. They become murderers and and and nervous wrecks and and they need drugs and hypos and everything to try to keep it together. Why? Because there there's such a gross darkness pressing upon civilization. &gt;&gt; But in the midst, oh my, just like it was, what did the prophet say? He said it it right now we're standing just like it was in the beginning. There's this gross darkness upon the earth. This this confusion. But right in the midst of all the confusion, there's word seed laying there. There's word seed laying in there. And the prophet would say it like this. He would say, I just backing up into a message preached just uh right before shalom. It's there's a man that can turn on the light. He says the seed was already upon the earth. &gt;&gt; I believe God had planted the seed and just as the sun could get to that seed, it began to grow. And that's the reason it only taken days to bring forth these things. Because the seed was already in the earth. All it needed was light. &gt;&gt; Because in that seed was what? Transforming power. &gt;&gt; But no light, no life. No light, no power. &gt;&gt; No message, no deliverance. No message, no light. &gt;&gt; No message, no quickening power. &gt;&gt; Look, this this is not this is not a history lesson tonight. &gt;&gt; But that same quickening power was that was back there is right here, right now, present amongst us. &gt;&gt; He's omnipresent. He's omnipotent. The same God that was with Moses is the same God that's here right now. The same God that was with brother Brandham is the same God that's here right now. &gt;&gt; This isn't this isn't a a history lesson of saying, "Oh, there was light back there." But that light is here right now in God's believing bride. It is the vindicated word and it's here stronger and greater and in more power than it's ever been. I say the pillar of fire is right here right now tonight. I say, "What do you have need of? What are you going through? What do you want? I say you don't have to put it off in the future and you don't have to look back 60 years to try to to think something up. You can have what you have need of right now. Pray for revelation. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see you standing here right now amongst us. The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He goes on and says paragraph 73, and that's the way God has today. just maybe trying to move towards the inspiration of what we're trying to bring here. He says and that's the way God has today. His seed is already here, his word. The only thing it needs is light on it. &gt;&gt; Now, now I want to just say it goes both ways, right? Because it's both it's word coming to word. The word was there and now God bringing a vindicated prophet is going to shine light on that word and make that word vindicated and alive. We'll just read the prophet. He says and that's the way God has today. His seed is already there, his word. The only thing it needs is light on it. And he is that light for he is the word. &gt;&gt; The word and the light is the same thing. &gt;&gt; The life in there is the light of the word. See, it's the life. The germ of life lays within the grain. The life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the grain. That's the way that Christ in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is, it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I'm about to get happy cuz I could never do what I was supposed to do &gt;&gt; until the light of the message of the hour shined upon this scene. &gt;&gt; I was put here for a purpose. I was born for a purpose. I might have been born to my mommy and my daddy, but oh, I have a heavenly father. I was predestinated and placed in Ladyia for a purpose. I tried to fulfill that purpose out in the world with drugs and alcohol and loose living and jobs and money and all those things, but none of those things could ever fulfill the purpose of the seed. &gt;&gt; You were looking, you were wondering, you were trying to figure out why can I never be happy? Why do I always need more of this and more of that? It's just empty substitutes. But when the light of the message of the hour strikes that seed, it satisfies. &gt;&gt; It's everything that I was ever looking for. &gt;&gt; It told me who I was, where I came from, where I'm going. &gt;&gt; It revealed to me my purpose. There is no greater purpose &gt;&gt; than to be the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; He chose you &gt;&gt; to be the message of the hour made flesh. &gt;&gt; He chose you to be the vindicated word. You were that seed word &gt;&gt; and there was darkness and chaos. &gt;&gt; Just like Christ said, "I got needs to go by Samaria." He said, "I got needs to send you Elijah. I got needs to send you the voice of Elijah. I got seed out there. &gt;&gt; It's laid out there, Lady Osia. And all the potential is in the seed. But when this word becomes vindicated and it shines on that seed, there will be a transforming power that you might come into your purpose. &gt;&gt; Your purpose ain't to be a mechanic. Your purpose ain't to be a good architect. Your purpose ain't to be a painter. Your purpose to is to be a Holy Ghost filled Jesus Christ light shining, victorious bride of Jesus Christ with the same acts flowing in you that flowed in the apostles. &gt;&gt; You might be in disguise as a painter, &gt;&gt; but you're a peculiar one. &gt;&gt; Hey, this this painter, he not only can he change the color of the walls, but he can cast out evil spirits. &gt;&gt; Come on. Jesus was a carpenter &gt;&gt; by trade, but he was much more than a carpenter. &gt;&gt; Come on. What about you? If he was the light of the world and he said, "You are the light of the world." You are so much more &gt;&gt; than what Leia want you to be. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; We don't fit into the mold. &gt;&gt; I don't fit into the mold of Lady Osia. &gt;&gt; I'm not happy with just a paycheck. I'm not happy with just a fancy car. &gt;&gt; I'm not happy with just a good house. &gt;&gt; I am happy with the revealed word of the hour. I'm happy with Malachi 4:5. I'm happy that I heard my name. When the seven seals were unveiled and that seven seal thundered out, it called my name and I'm happy about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I might just have a jubilee by myself. &gt;&gt; Because if it wasn't for that, &gt;&gt; I might be six feet under. If it wasn't for that, I'd be in a prison cell. If it wasn't for that, I would be serving the purpose of the devil. But oh God, rich in mercy wherewith in the grace that he loved me, he called my name. &gt;&gt; He called me out of you. He said, "Come up higher. You don't belong down there. &gt;&gt; Just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is, it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do because it is the life that's in it. Now, maybe the devil right here's fighting against somebody. Devil, you're defeated. Okay. Yeah, sure. You you've done a lot of things you haven't done, but what is it in there that's saying, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; Something else is saying, "But you could never live it." But something in there saying, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; Who you going to listen to? I choose a vindicated word. I choose the message of the hour. I choose the light of the day. I'll listen to that. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I get excited. I don't know any other way to be Cuz I know what I was. &gt;&gt; I know what the devil was trying to sell me. I know what the devil was trying to make me. Make me some salesman with some career and some hobbies. And I was doomed for a devil's hell. But then the message of the hour come crying, "Grace, Grace, you don't belong down there in that chicken yard. You don't need to clock up with all of them. Come up higher. All life. So life is only by the word of God made manifest. Life comes only by the word of God made manifest. As long as it's just in the book like this, it can still be questioned. &gt;&gt; But when it's made manifest, &gt;&gt; then you see the product of what it spoke of &gt;&gt; being manifested. &gt;&gt; Then that is light on the word. The word said so and then when it comes to pass that is life in light. Light bringing life. Light brings life. Now in our text here this woman no doubt maybe she tried to resist. Maybe she didn't want to go that way. But according to the testimony of these Jews, they've caught a woman in the very act of adultery. And she is subject to the law. And I want to say that she was in a very bad spot. She was doomed to die and she was guilty of the act because the law said in the mouth of two or three witnesses, let it be established. &gt;&gt; So now the witnesses have brought her before the word. And now they're saying to the word according to the law, here is this woman. She's in darkness. She's in chaos. She's doomed to die. The word says to stone her for for for she's guilty. &gt;&gt; But now here's the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to say they brought her to the right place. Hey, don't just bring me to church. &gt;&gt; Don't just bring me to some theology. &gt;&gt; Don't just bring me to a courthouse. If you're going to bring me anywhere, bring me to the master. [Music] &gt;&gt; And here in the presence of that light, though they were blinded by it, he ignores them and tearries and then says, Oh, I I wonder what that atmosphere found felt like. I wonder how exposed they felt standing in his presence when he said, "He who is without sin." I wonder if just a flood of memory and law and how many times maybe they should have been stoned and all the things that they done. And from the eldest to the youngest, they all walked away. And he asked her, "Where are thine accusers?" And she said,"None but thee." And what did the word say? "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more." And that light by divine promise has been made manifest again in Lady Osia. And we're all guilty, an adulterous generation, full of wickedness and chaos and sin ripe for the judgment. But then the capstone comes crying grace grace. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I did this and I did that. &gt;&gt; I made a mess of things and and Where where are thine accusers? &gt;&gt; Well, I guess I'm coming to you, Lord. I don't I don't accuse you. Go and sin no more. You see the light being manifested into the darkness. What did it do? It brought forth life. That's what the word does is it takes a hopeless situation. I say somebody out here, you ought to open up your heart. Let the light shine. You feel like your situation's hopeless, but I want to tell you that's what the light's here for. &gt;&gt; It's here to shine into the darkness and take a hopeless situation and turn it around. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says as we'll just work quickly towards a close. Paul said in Ephesians 5:8, he says, "For ye sometimes were in darkness, &gt;&gt; but now ye are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to walk like him, talk like him, &gt;&gt; and act like him. &gt;&gt; And you forgive me for maybe being this foolish if it would be thought so. If it's so hard for you to wonder what it would have been like to be Christlike 2,000 years ago, then maybe you can just think back 50, 60 years ago, because I believe that same light was made manifested in the prophet, &gt;&gt; a first one to maturity, &gt;&gt; testifying to the rest of the field. This is what this word will produce. And &gt;&gt; the prophet of God said this in the Messiah. He said, "That's the way God's church is." His eagllets, his Messiah, they look like him. They act like him. They preach like him. They do the works that he did. The things that I do, he also more than this shall you do. Cuz I go to the father. These signs follow them. My eagllets, they'll do just as I do if my spirit is in them. they'll do the works that I do. If they don't do the works I do, that's because that my spirit is not in them. Now, friends, don't try to hang on to some works or some false vindication as an evidence that you got it. &gt;&gt; If you're struggling right there, just say, you know what? If I don't got it, Lord, &gt;&gt; I want it. We are not a religion. We are not a denominations. We don't need maracupas. We don't need we don't need two weeks of good works. And we don't need one year of good works. All he wants is a repented heart. &gt;&gt; You can't fix your whole world and run and make everything right if you've done so much wrong. But what you can do is come to the master &gt;&gt; just as those men brought her to Jesus' feet and said, "Here's the problem." I say you ought to run to the altar, run to his feet, say, "Lord, here's the problem. &gt;&gt; I'm a sinner &gt;&gt; and I need your grace. &gt;&gt; I need your Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I don't see the same works. I don't see the same signs, Lord, but here I am." &gt;&gt; Now, just turning this corner here to &gt;&gt; make this point. the message, the word of God is the so n. And brother Brandon would lay in principles through several messages where he would show how Moses was the anointed word for his day. And he would even say it like this. And who do you say this is? He say, "So if he was the messenger of that hour, he was the Messiah of that hour. He was the anointed one." And brother Brandon would say it like this. and turn on the light. I'm trying to bring this to the hour that we're now living. He says this internal light. He says, "Here was John on the earth." Making that written word live. He was the voice of one crying in the wilderness. And he also was preparing the way before the Messiah. And Jesus said, "You love to walk in his light be because he was that light, a bright and shining light." You know, the scripture if we go to it says, "You rejoiced for that season. Right? The light that John was shining, he he was the manifestation of Isaiah 40. Behold, when crying in the wilderness, now that written word was vindicated in John and it was now light. &gt;&gt; You you follow. And now he says and and he says you love to walk in his light because he was that light, bright and shining light. And John, he said, now I must decrease. My light must go out because I have served my time that's prophesied of me. Hear ye him. He is the one. Follow him. It's living in that day in in the day. So then now what is he pointing to? He's pointing to the Messiah. Right? Here comes the prophet at one place. Brother Brandham says it changed from the prophet to his prophecy. &gt;&gt; Right? And now now now the word made flesh in Christ. We know he was the anointed word. The anointed Messiah. &gt;&gt; Five to 10 more minutes. He was the anointed word. The anointed Messiah. Now, now listen to this. This is so you're following the principle, right? That that Moses was the anointed word. So much so that the prophet would say he was the Messiah for that hour, right? Because it was the light of God's word being manifested to the people. If you were going to go into an Exodus, it's going to be Moses. You're going to if you're going to escape the judgment of the wrath and the and the evolutionary age, it was going to be on the boat with Noah. Are you following me? That was the light of God's word. And now John, he was that burning light. But now he's saying, "I must decrease." &gt;&gt; Because now Jesus Christ, the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now watch this. In John 16:7. Now here's the Messiah speaking to his disciples. He says, "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away." Could you imagine uh uh the disciples and how how could that be good? I I'm so brother Billy I Lord, what do you mean it's good that you're going to go away? You're the Messiah. You're everything that we hope for. You're everything that we believe for. You're going to restore the kingdom. What do you mean it's good that you go away? For if I go not away, &gt;&gt; the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, &gt;&gt; I will send them unto you. &gt;&gt; So it's better. It's profitable. Here's the Messiah tell. I'm going to go away. But if I go away, if I could say it like this, this body that you now see, this corporal body is going to go away. &gt;&gt; But I'm not staying gone. I'm coming back. &gt;&gt; And not in 2,000 years. I'm giving you a promise. If you go up there and tar in Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; you'll be endued with power from on high. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not going to be the corporal body that comes back. It's going to be the spirit. &gt;&gt; Because what is he wanting to do now? Just as John was that light. &gt;&gt; Just as Jesus is that light, it's expedient that I go away because now you are going to be that light. &gt;&gt; I want to use your body. &gt;&gt; I want to use your life. I want to use your hands. I want to use your feet. &gt;&gt; Now, we have received our Messiah, Christ, the anointed, vindicated word of the hour. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Is that too hard for for some people? I don't know about you, but Malachi 4:5 introduced me to Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. The seals that were told torn off. Well, the loosing of those seals revealed Christ. &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled before us. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I you you might see a man. &gt;&gt; Many people look up there and see a man. Oh, but it's so much more. There is the logos, the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; a son of man, revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now remember what he said. Life comes only by the word of God made manifest. As long as it's in just in the book like this, it can still be questioned. &gt;&gt; You can question a lot of things and a lot of people have a question about the message and a lot of people want to ask questions and this and that. But I want to tell you, as long as it's just in letter form, &gt;&gt; it could be questioned. as long as it's just in the Bible. As long as it's just on the tape. &gt;&gt; But when that word that's on the tape gets in you, &gt;&gt; hey, you can question a lot of things, but one thing you can't question. I once was lost, &gt;&gt; but now I'm found. &gt;&gt; I once was blind, &gt;&gt; but now I see. &gt;&gt; Like they wanted to question the blind man. Give God praise. &gt;&gt; We know this man is a sinner. &gt;&gt; We know brother Brandham is a false prophet. &gt;&gt; You can go ahead and call him whatever you want to call him. Alls I know is I once was blind. &gt;&gt; Hey, I once was lost, but now I see. I have seen the light. The sen light has shined upon my predestinated seat. And I have been quickened. Go ahead and question it all you want, but I am free. Go ahead and question it all you want. You can question whether he's a healer, but I've been healed. You can question whether he's a deliverer, but I've been delivered. You can question whether the seals have been opened, but I've been opened. It has released the light that was in the seed, and I'm going back to glory soon and very soon. I know I'm going to be changed. If that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you, it will quicken. &gt;&gt; There is a quickening power right here this evening to quicken your mortal body, to quicken your thoughts, to quicken your life, to quicken your actions. &gt;&gt; Let your light shine. Light brings life. If the musicians would come, brother Brandham played his part. Go ahead and get on to me all you want. Brother Brandham, even he identified it. Go study current uh present stage of my ministry, September 1962. Oh, it's just too clear. Brother David Boze, the angel of the Lord, told the prophet, "Take David Aboose out into the yard." And Joseph, Brother Joseph Boz said, "Brother Brand, have you ever read the rest of second Timothy?" And Brother Brandon says, "No, I I I guess I haven't." And and and Brother Brandham says to the congregation, "Go read it when you get home." Because brother Brandham was now entering into the last stage of his ministry. And if you read the rest of second Timothy, it says, "My time of departure is at hand. I've run a good fight. I've shined the light with all my heart." &gt;&gt; But he's gone on to his reward. &gt;&gt; And now we've received the word. But I want to tell you, it can't just stay in the book. &gt;&gt; It can't just stay on the tape. As long as it's there, it can be questioned. &gt;&gt; But when that word is made alive and vindicated in you, you are now the light. &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Look, God God didn't ordain the the gospel to be preached with tracks and electronics. He ordained men and women to be born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And now ye are light. Now, I'm not discouraging anybody from passing out tapes and tracks, but I tell you what, they want to see somebody that's salty. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God says this in the Messiah, he says, "Then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah," maybe you can just play softly pour your spirit out on me. Then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah, then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was, we become messiahes, little lights. That's what the church is supposed to be, lights, little anointed ones. But as long as it's just in the book, as long as it's just on the tape, it can be questioned. But when it's made manifest, the prophet of God said, "Then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested." Now, the only way we know what Malachi 4:5 was going to be is because it's come. The only way we knew what were under those seals because they've been revealed. &gt;&gt; Now, you might be wondering and questioning, "What is that bride going to be? What is she going to be like?" But I want to tell you, you don't have to leave here tonight wondering. [Music] Saints, we are not waiting for something to come. It's already here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Like those lepers sat there. Why sit we here until we die? Brother Billy, when we got a storehouse full, if you see it in the word, church, do not stop short. That was just for the apostles. No, that's for you. That was just for the preachers. That's for you. He said he had to have a mighty invincible army. That's me. Let's start looking into the word and be like that little boy, mama. That's me. The pro prophet of God said it this way. This might give somebody encouragement. Don't look at what you used to be. Look at what you're going to be. &gt;&gt; Well, I might not be all of what he said, but I'm going to be it. &gt;&gt; Because he said I would. So then when we start speaking like that devil I might have made the mistake but he said &gt;&gt; he said &gt;&gt; it is get behind me. He said &gt;&gt; I am the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said upon this rock I'll build my church. The gates of hell can't prevail against it and I give unto them the keys. We're talking about being the light. I give unto you the keys. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth, that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh. If it was flesh in that day by the son, the groom, it's the flesh today in the bride. &gt;&gt; See, whosoever sins you remit to them, they are remitted. Whosoever sins you retain to them are retained. Now, the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to their priest, but that's carnal. Watch. It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. I church, I say, Lord, reveal that word to me. Show me who I am. Lord, give me skill and understanding. Lord, I I pray for revelation. Maybe with every head bowed. Your life declares what you are. [Music] Maybe you don't look like what you will be. But is there something in your heart saying, "I want to be that word." Is there something in you saying, "I want to be more like Christ." If there's somebody here that just wants to draw closer to the Lord or maybe get a new refilling of the Holy Ghost. Maybe you've been bound and that's all right if others need to go and it's late. There might be somebody here that's tired of the cycles and the ups and downs and they haven't really been a light and they go out in the highways and byways but doesn't seem like maybe they're shining that light. Is there somebody here that say, "Lord, I want to be a better light. Lord, I need your Holy Spirit." Maybe you are struggling with cutting your hair or trimming off the ends and you haven't caught the revelation that that's contrary to the word of God. Maybe you need God to give you a better revelation on how to dress and carry yourself. Saints, I say there needs to be a total surrender tonight that our lives can start declaring that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let's just sing this song. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my cup again. [Music] Heal my heart. Make me whole. [Music] I need you now. Pour your spirit out.

You are worthy of it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship you, Lord Jesus. Oh, you call our name. You are &gt;&gt; rise and shine. &gt;&gt; You are you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you are worthy of it, Lord. Oh, he's the the lamb slave before the foundation of the world. He's worthy. Who is worthy to take the book? You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; That same one is here right now. What is your heart's cry? &gt;&gt; What is your need? &gt;&gt; You deserve glory. [Music] What a wonderful name it is. What a wonderful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ our King. What a wonderful name it is. I think I'm rich. What a wonderful name it is. The name of Jesus. You were the word. You were the word in the beginning. [Music] One with God the most high. Oh, you're in glory in creation. Now reveal in you our Christ. What a beautiful name it is. What a beautiful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ my king. What a beautiful name it is. Nothing compares to me. What a beautiful name it is the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; We'll just quickly pray a dismissal. I feel maybe some would like to go but others just want to remain in his presence. Lord Jesus, we thank you that you've come by our way, Lord. And just pray that maybe a broken up message, Lord, but in that was your word. And I pray it brings light and life to those that have need of that light shining into their situations and their homes, Lord. And Lord, you said, "Ye are the light of the world." And you've given us such a great word and a message none other than Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Lord, we want that word to be born in us. Lord, as you said, ye are the light to the world. We want to be what you said we are to be, Lord, and go out there and be able to shine that light into the dark places and bring salvation and healing and deliverance to those that are needy. Lord, we want those same works to be found in us that are always attendant to your word, Lord. So, we just thank you for this time. Pray that you be with the needs of your people. Lord, as some are maybe needing to go, may you just bless their travels, the others that just want to remain in worship, Father. May there just be a sweet atmosphere that you can do with hearts, Lord. And Lord, maybe there's somebody here tonight. They're just like that woman. They've got caught in a lot of problems and they don't know how they're going to get out of it. Lord, you're the answer. And may that light just shine in through all the confusion and darkness right now, Lord, and bring a faith and a confidence that everything's going to be okay. You didn't want heaven without us. So Jesus, you brought hell. You are dismissed. [Music] My sin was greater. Your love was greater. What could separate us now? What a wonderful name it is. What a wonderful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ, my king. What a wonderful name it is. Nothing compares to this. What a wonderful name it is. The name of Jesus. I give myself away. [Music] Oh, I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away. So are you. Can you see? Here I am. Here I stand. Lord, my life is in your hands. Lord, I long to see your desire in me and I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can use me. Take my heart. Take my life as a living sacrifice and all my dreams. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; All my plans, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, just place it in his hands now. &gt;&gt; In your hands. And I give my &gt;&gt; Oh, just a full surrender now. Just give it all to him. Oh, I give myself away so you can hear me. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away.
