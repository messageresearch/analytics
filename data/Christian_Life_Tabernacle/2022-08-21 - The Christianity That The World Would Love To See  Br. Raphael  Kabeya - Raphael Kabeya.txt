========================================

[Music] so [Music] um [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] man praise the lord welcome you to the house of god we just ask that you bear with us we got a new sound board so some some voices might be louder than others some instruments louder than others but we want to make a joyful noise to the lord amen let's just sing that song you are my strength when i am weak just to start the service why don't we just go ahead and all stand together you are my strength when i am weak you are the treasure that i see you are my olden [Music] and seeking you as a precious jewel i want the holy ghost to [Music] you are my own [Music] jesus [Music] god [Music] world [Music] myself [Music] again [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] me [Music] now [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] jesus [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so um [Music] we just want to make an announcement there's several things that have been left at the church especially children's coats and sweaters so if you're missing something or you haven't seen something in a while it might be here at church and if it's a brother or sister look around if you haven't seen them in a while you want to get them in church amen and also you notice that we're just we're thankful to the lord that we're making progress towards the building of the church and we just want to um maybe reiterate to you that the parking is extremely limited so we appreciate you being patient with us for for families for brothers that are riding with your family it might work well if you're able to pull up and drop your family off and then go park maybe down at the baptist church or if you find one of the streets there that's convenient and then you can walk up yourself we're trying to have somebody positioned and maybe give a ride from the baptist church to help with that so but if you're a mother with the family and your kids uh we're trying to keep the the paved parking right here uh for the elderly and for mother with young children once again if you're a father riding with your family if it's if you're able to drop your family off and they go apart but we just thank you each one for all your patience in the process but i'm i'm looking forward to what god has for us you know we're we're going through growing pains and so we just ask that you bear with us we're just gonna ask brother mike to come at this time and have a little psalm reading so let's just go ahead and stand we'll just open in a word of prayer as he would make his way heavenly father we love you we're thankful that we have another opportunity to gather together lord and just be able to sing the songs of zion and to be able to be in an atmosphere lord knowing that you're here with us and we're looking forward to the word that you have prepared for us knowing that this is a predestinated moment in time we're just asking lord for the anointing of our precious brother raphael and brother billy as he would interpret the word lord our hearts are excited with great expectation for you just to move in a mighty way lord and speak the words that you would have to each one individually lord we love you lord we just commit the service now to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen brother mike to be a bad thing until you get a little bit of light on it and it turns out it's good and something may appear very good you're safe or comfortable you get a little bit of light on it and it turns out it's maybe not so good the entrance of thy words giveth light it was interesting that in genesis 1 3 when god was first bringing the world to manifestation and we live in a dark age you know i don't suppose that's news to anyone here you know the circumstances around us are such that there's all kinds of things that are you know seeming to offer light seeming to offer guidance and things can wear any kind of camouflage look like they're good a way may look good some advice may look good but the entrance of thy words given it says in first corinthians 4 5 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and we'll make many of us the council of the hearts you know we're not careful we can lean on something else to give us a little bit of light guidance clarity in this dark hour the google search the advice or counsel of friends an expected career path or curriculum probably the worst our own discernment how we feel whether we get a tingle or not our emotions probably the worst guide there is in this dark age and i heard a person the other day on a christian radio station saying time and needs a path forward all she does is worship and then all of a sudden her path becomes clear well be careful you know who the chief worshiper has always been in every age and as we read in psalm 119 it's his word not your worship that bringeth light you know there can be no light without his word if you don't have his words then it's just darkness then it's just no guidance at all it says first john 1 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light that's right and in him is no darkness at all you know i was just reading that and i don't know about you but i sure need light i sure need his words to give me light to help me see and get clarity in this dark hour but you know as i was looking at that it one other thing stuck out to me you know there's an effect that his light has on us it makes us sources of light you know it says that for ye were sometimes darkness in ephesians 5 but now are ye light in the lord walk ye according to the light think about that if his words give illumination then if you become light then how what should the effect of us be if we have become light jesus said ye are the light of the world it doesn't say that uh you know it says let your light so shine before men it's matthew 5 16. you want to take it down that they may see your good works not just hear what you say but see your works your words can say anything you can speak any message but light is something people see not something they hear and words without light are just words amen i wonder how often we get focused on the telling the good news we forget about the showing you know the scripture says in first peter 3 15 be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you the hope that lieth within you i had to ask myself how many times has somebody actually asked me without me having to tell them first [Music] the effect of the light is as it gives illumination his words the entrance of his words giveth light you know as i was reading that this this weekend you know my prayer was first of all i need light how precious are his words but also that it should have an effect and i should be light such that folks can ask me the reason for the hope that lieth within you let's just read that little portion of psalm 119 together we're going to be starting in verses 129 and ending on 136 let's read that together thy testimonies are wonderful therefore doth my soul keep them the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple i opened my mouth and panted for i longed for thy commandments look thou upon me and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me deliver me from the oppression of man so will i keep thy precepts make thy face to shine upon thy servant and teach me thy statutes rivers of waters run down mine eyes because they keep not thy law amen amen praise the lord you may have your seats i wanted to sing that song jesus hold my hand in the key of f i need thee every hour [Music] through [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh that i could explain the way [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my [Music] [Music] when jesus came he washed my [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's my redeemer master lord of kings down here i'll tell the story and i give him all the lord he brought me out and he gave me a song well thank you [Music] [Music] it's amazing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] shadow [Music] [Music] is [Applause] just a few more [Music] [Applause] [Music] cuz [Music] [Music] oh there's no one there's no there's one one there's no one like jesus there's no one there's no one i look around where [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] there's hallelujah one like him there's no one like jesus [Music] [Music] because we're marches [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh why don't you just praise the lord we're marching over to jerusalem nothing can stop you nothing can keep you from making it why don't you praise the lord this is the day the lord has made i will rejoice let the redeemed of the lord say so this is your moment this is your time just praise the lord oh hallelujah the lord is good amen all right well we might as well have brother mark david come and sing a little song for us we got a few song specials we won't be able to get to them all because we are thankful for each one that has turned in a request so if we were not able to get to you we just have a limited time here but maybe we can get you this evening so [Music] i will answer when he calls for me i will hear when their oh i'll be somewhere listening for my oh i'll be listening i'll be oh yes listening i'll be oh listening for my name i'll be somewhere i'll be somewhere listening i'll be somewhere listening for my name if my heart is right when he calls me if my odd is right how will he if my heart is right when he calls me i'll be somewhere listening for my name oh i'll be somewhere listening i'll be listening i'll be somewhere listening for my name i'll be somewhere

somewhere listening i'll be somewhere listening for my name [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we'll just use this opportunity to take up the ties and offerings if maybe we can play that song i cleaned the blood in key of f and then take up the ties and offerings and sing this song sister sharon tub with her song special we do have a couple uh [Music] in order in the service how many are going to pray for sister rebecca's unspoken request these are moments that god provides us because the scripture says the prayer of a righteous man your prayer makes a difference and many times we don't realize that god's wanting to use us to be the difference maker i believe god works like that amen so i just want to i don't want to let this go by because i say i'm guilty many times come forth and i'm not able to hear and sometimes with the sound and everything if you're not able to hear the request i think it would be a responsible thing maybe after service to maybe ask somebody what what are we praying for there needs to be a unity amongst the church and we also just want to remember uh sister lori she's at home with a headache some severe headache and if any of y'all have ever suffered like that let's just bear together amen praise the lord troy why don't you just come and take these [Music] [Music] let's just enter into prayer together this morning father god we're just so thankful lord that we have this opportunity lord we're thankful god that you saw fit to call us and to call us together to this precious group of brothers and sisters lord god and we pray father that you would just hear a prayer this morning as we know you do lord you would just bless each and every request lord god those that are sick and hurting lord god in their bodies possibly in their minds lord or something deep inside their soul we know nothing about but god you see and know each and every need we just pray that you would enter into that that you would touch each and every one lord pray father that you would bless the service with the breaking of the bread of life your word and we pray for you to impart it to each of us that lord you would just bless these tithes and offerings as as they are even as meeker as they are lord from our end that lord you promised you would bless us and we pray father that you would bless each heart that has the intent to give lord we thank you

amen you believe that this morning he certainly is good let's just bow our heads in prayer once again father we ask you to bless us be with us and help us this morning we ask your word to be our portion for your word is spirit and its life and you seek those to worship you in spirit and in truth father we're here to hear from you this morning we ask you to be mighty in our midst in the precious and wonderful name of the lord we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated for just a moment this morning and we'd just like to uh make a few announcements like to welcome all our visitors and just trust that the lord's your portion he loves you he paid a great price for you and he can do exceedingly and abundantly for you even above that which you can ask so you just think how big you can ask and he can do better amen you can't even come up with what he can't do better amen that's the kind of god we serve amen we just have a few announcements once again we like to thank you for your patience with the construction and we hope in the next few weeks we'll have it all leveled out out there and be able to start parking and and but it's going to be a process and i i know it's going to be hard and but if you'll be patient we'll make it through it and and i think the outcome will be a blessing and we're we're putting a little extra room in our building so you can go win souls amen we want new converts that's what our hearts desire is just to have new converts and that people might know you know this message is ever more true every day because more and more of the things that have been prophesied are certainly coming to pass so i'd also like to make a little announcement next sunday after sunday morning service anybody who's interested in helping and volunteering with sunday school we'd like to meet with you and we want to discuss with you maybe some sunday school options so if you'd like to teach or help with sunday school if you would meet with us next sunday after service we will have a little meeting and talk with you what what's on our heart and our mind to do now also we want to remember brother cosman and brother matthew they're traveling to romania tuesday for youth meetings and services and we just trust that uh the lord will be with them so they go as part of you this you know our messenger told us if you can't go yourself send somebody so you send your prayers with them they'll be successful maybe the last one's over there wouldn't it be wonderful in the middle of the meeting some little soul comes to the altar and kneels down gives their heart to the lord and we all leave how many wants to leave amen we got some levers here amen well somebody's got to stay and keep things going so bless you stayers we're happy for you but i want to be a believer believer lever that's what i am i'm a believer leaver amen amen so also um we uh asked brother manuel rajos to help us as a deacon and you'll see him playing the role of a deacon and so we'll give him a little while to adjust and if he still wants to be a deacon after a few weeks then we'll go ahead and state him in there so you pray for uh brother um manuel as he uh he does it you know it's a real test being a deacon amen okay you know who the testers are okay good good we're all on the same page so god's good at amen we're very happy to have brother raphael with us this morning an elder in the message uh he's uh brother billy's father-in-law so um but it has nothing to do with the gospel he's uh i i love brother raphael i love his spirit so you really enjoy him so let's stand this morning once again as we prepare to change the order of the service and i'd like to read the scripture to you before we turn it over found in the book the gospel of saint john these are very comforting scriptures so i want you to take hope this morning and because sometimes discouragement blinds you or closes your ears from seeing the hope that god gives you so i don't care this morning what kind of condition you're in what kind of sins you have on your chart he's greater and he paid a price and he can break through every every bar every wall everything that satan has put up against you he can break through it if you'll just incline your ears to his word so just listen for him to talk to you this morning he'll lift you up but these scriptures are found in saint john the 10th chapter and the 27th verse and this is what he says he says in the 26th verse he says but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i have said unto you now listen to this great verse my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one oh i like that ah nobody's plucking me out of his hand why because he said so amen he said so he said the father's greater than all and nobody can pluck me out of his hand a lot of people have tried a lot of spirits have tried a lot of things have tried but they're losers amen hallelujah you win this morning so take them for everything that you have need of this morning amen as we invite our brother our precious brother uh to minister the words of life i haven't talked to him i haven't told them all your problems you know and all that i don't even know all your problems i've got enough of my own but this gospel is eternal and so someone's going to come from thousands of miles away he's going to open this book of life and preach to you in a different language and the holy spirit's going to feed you that's god amen let's recognize them this morning let's sing amazing grace this morning sister as we ask the lord just to come now and his spirit too give you that great blanket of security that nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand i've got you i've got you this morning i'm going to feed you this morning i'm going to minister to you this morning i'm going to give you comfort this morning i'm here for you don't look back don't look at the path look to him the giver of everlasting land amen amazing great hallelujah [Music] [Music] us [Music] like me i once was lost [Music] [Music] i see think of it now [Music] twas great [Music] and praise my fears [Music] [Music] oh wasn't it wonderful when it appeared [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let the holy spirit come by you now invite him in close to your heart [Applause] lord we invite you this morning into our presence to see [Applause] god's brains oh let's just worship him in that course this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music]

abby almost usually i i put my phone on on on silence when i go to sleep because with my age i don't want to be working up quickly telephone but that day i i left my phone a rang country god when i look see you in circle it's a it was a sister who usually doesn't call me infidel but she was she's a faithful sister of the church i said it was a problem i told my wife there must be a problem uh how come this sister is calling me at this time i pick up pastor ple uh pastor if you will i want you to pray for my son who's dying attention uh this is a it's a young man who's uh who's in the military he's about my age the mother believed the message when the young man was little he grew up but then he left the message he went in the military and he was living like everybody else and it was he caught calvin and like he was in the military they brought him to a military hospital they sent him to the general hospital and the the the general hospital they sent them to a specialized hospital for covert labor when he got there to feed because he was he was having short of shortness of breath they left them his dad said i would like to see him go and die at home then rather than in a house and then they took him they took him home avent rosa around 11. he said he told his mom i want you to call the pastor and have him pray for me he was he almost was not breathing uh the mom called me the first the thought that came to my mind was that boy is a back slider he left the message for a long time and then some told me it's it's a person in need we pray for him i didn't do a long prayer i said lord be merciful to bring him back to life amen i said amen i hear the noise on the other side of the phone in the in the room i hear people screaming [Music] it's this dying person that they were trying to lift up a man when i said amen i'm healed his parents didn't understand he's on computer telephone they they hang up the phone five minutes later uh or the mother's calling me with tears count amen when you said amen he jumped up and he began to scream praise god praise god and i had tears he didn't send you to yes implement you i said lord you are you are god foreign and today is healthy is good is in good health and strong it's to say arrested that our god remains god. and in the time of distress if you go to him it will answer [Music] i may have many things to say but i would like to keep saving and i know even after many years that we have not seen each other's and when you come and you meet one of your dear friends it i normally don't talk much but in situations like this you feel like talking a little too much i was going to forget one of the one precious person that always goes with me my my my friend forgot him sema company it's my my wife my accomplice it's my accomplice accomplish she's always with me i call her a a girl with a good heart girl with a good heart can you stand please [Applause] [Music] i heard with a little english that i can understand that you have started the work to build a tabernacle for our lord offended that you may worship him and hear his word in good conditions my prayer is that the lord may put his hands on it to the buddha starting from verse one [Music] the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things that which must come shortly come to pass and that he ascend and signify it by his angel unto his servant john paul who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that they hear it the word of this prophecy and keeps those things which are written therein for the time is at hand could you believe this blessing to the reading of his words that the blessing is for those that reads that hear and keep the words of the things that are written and we know that we become what we eat and i want this morning to speak just for a few moments for a delicate subject about christianity that the world would love to see christianism [Music] there is a great proliferation or an increase of church of christian churches in all the cities in all the towns christian churches are multiplying the diversions they all have differences is and in their differences they all claim to have the only true and original faith of the bible and and for that they are waging a war of influence each church wants to be on top of the other church and an honest man who is really looking and wanting to be honest with his own heart we say but don't kill iglesias he doesn't know what church to go to but we all know that if there is a bogus or a counterfeit bill of 100 dollars it cannot exist unless there was a true and original bill somewhere that this one was a copy of me the the bogus dollar is an imitation of the truth you know you have to know that they cannot be a bogus unless the truth existed first that's why the confusion and the agitation that exists among christians today is not bothering christians and they know that god leads his own malchetes regardless of what happened here and there the the the true the elected ones they know that god is always in charge and god is the word not an imagination the lord himself talked about the things that had to happen in this time in matthew chapter 24. it says they will arise false christ and the false prophet the full one the false anointed ones they don't have a fake anointing they have a true anointing may suffer but they are they are they are false judas had that's why when you see people uh they they try to oh jesus jesus never invented himself the for prophet defoe the uh false uh prophets are false teachers they will do great signs and wonders and there would be even a point where they would uh uh deceive the elect if it was possible they think the only thing that assures us because he knew them and predestinated them before the foundation of the world the elect the elected they are very sensitive to the purity of the word brought forth to help the elected and to lift up the faith we are not bringing the word to so to show how much we know excellent oh how much we excel in this or that we bring the word used to help the children of god and to lift up the faith to connect them to the creator not to ourselves we are just past the man by him he abides the son and daughter of god will come to god situation if you if you attach yourself to god to respect her you will respect me your connection to god will impose the respect to the servants of god lazy the elected are only looking to the infallible word made manifest in this time god spoke in this age and we know it's god who spoke they are impacted and influenced by the word of god papa no not by uh cannons [Music] channel not by not by the channel okay not by the channel that god is using me if you wanna see par do you remember they are influenced by god himself who's the word that's what the elected or the elected are looking something is about to happen in this world they know and there's no way to stop it it's it's it's it's useless to hide behind religion there or to fill yourself up with religious rituals to try to show how much we are christians there is only one way to escape the judgment that's going to hit the earth and it's to find a shore refuge and the only the only refuge or the only hiding place that i know of christ and it's christ the word becoming flesh in you that's the thing that will impact the world and it will influence it all of our arrogance so how we know how we believe the message of william branham that will not help jesus sir i believe my brother my sister actually that this generation is the generation that will see the second coming of the lord the modern events in the whole world negan uh wars la criminality uh uh criminality or corruption it shows that we are at the end time we are at the end of mankind's history we are at the evening of the civilization of humans and soon do you remember god himself will enter into the scene through the church or his own church god will enter into sin to restore adam's race to the very condition that they were in the beginning and i believe the world vive it wants to see a living christianity like it was in the time of the apostle and this word it's bringing us right back to the apostolic times it dropped it doesn't have to be a shame or something that we are just saying it's a life that we leave that shows that we are being brought right back into the apostolic times the the evening light has come and human civilization has come to an end i believe that fanduemund it's the end of the world celebrities it's the end of the church i don't believe in churches i believe in jesus christ i don't bring people into my church so that i can have them stay there [Music] i preach them the word that can make them free sons and daughters [Music] we don't insist that people may need to be behind us we'd have nothing to give them what we want that people may meet christ satisfying that they may hang on to him and that they become new creatures that they may be a living a a gospel for the world that we are living in you clement i believe the same sun that rose in the east is the same sun that's that's setting on the west do you apologize god promised by the prophet zechariah that in the evening time the light will come the same son that came that rose to the east el m who rose up and manifested the holy ghost through jesus christ of nazareth elementary school it's the same episode who's shining in the west in the same time montreal showing the same signs that jesus christ give prophecies about ivan what happened to the time of noah manifesto it was christ himself who was on the scene on the body of flesh the angel who visited abraham and who made himself two thousand years ago it's the same angel who brought forth this message it's not the message of william branham it's the message of god through william branham and she comes and then when i read the message i hear god speak to me and that can play a bigger role in your life you know the grand immigration shows the great and wonderful things they were fulfilled in the supernatural ministry of buddhism until this uh messenger messenger prophet is jesus christ he was even confused and compared to jesus christ baptism or nun people people baptized in the name of william branham and the prey in the name of william branagh but we know the prophet but we know that the prophet was revealing these son of man who's christ don't let the ensemble message me crew whom he was just a simple messenger just like a microphone when john the writer of the book of revelation when he was about to write what the seven thunders were saying the angel told them seal up what the seven cells as the seven thunders have broken and don't write it but in the day when the seventh angel will sound of his trump download in the seventh church age the seven church ages which we are in today [Music] and all the mysteries of god and all the subject about god how god is not a trinity man and one just one god because the jehovah of the old testament says jesus is jesus of the new year and all the other things devoted they had to be tied up in the voice of the seventh angel malaysia malachite 4 gathered up all the uh teachings and all the things that were suspended and and there were uh wrongly thoughts in the old testament the the seventh uh the serpent seed la trinity the the holy trinity la divinity supreme jesus christ the the the deity supreme deity of jesus christ the baptism of jesus christ of the holy ghost and today through this message we have seen the power of god in action long as you preach on long just celestia a powerful angel the heavenly uh celestial angel who's jesus christ [Music] two messengers on earth at the same time just like in the time of john the baptist a son of man revealing the son of man who was using him and i believe that you have the eyes the spiritual eyes to understand those things jesus jesus christ is incomparable isaiah 40 isaiah 40 and verse 25 it says to whom will he liken me we are serving an incomparable a god who's not like the others we have our faith our trust in him [Music] and we are not afraid of anything we want to throw ourselves into his arms you see i want you to remember this nippiness yeah mainly shows a man never take things in your own hands see who penelope if you take things in your own hands but know to give yourselves into the hands of god that is supposed to show the true face of christianity to the world it's become a trampoline for people seeking opportunities and they make the word of god the lapse of non-effect les opportuniste the opportunist on this objective they have uh objectives on the motif they have motives and in these days people are using the message if they don't want the message to use them all the messages say dude or the message is god talk to the people you to listen you cannot use god but give yourself to god and let him use you so you can be an instrument in his hands but today people want to use god as an instrument into their hands it's not going to work it's not going to go far it's also a sign of the end times the coming of the lord as it is at hand javed supreme i beg of you my friends listen to the sentence everyone a true christian life fascinating william because the message of william branham is a message of love it's a message based on love divine [Music] to treat everybody with kindness sister the message that's the message of william brown basically do you because it's god god literally loved the world god loves the sinners but he hates the sin it's a message that helps the sinner to get into the word the supernatural god who made himself tangible in the message of william burnham it has to capture the heart of the elect when it's brought with a pure heart to help and it's correctly received this message will stabilizes the members of the bride the elected lady is stable not to turn to new things la popularity popularity are honors all kinds of carnal pressures that people are enjoying today and they take a form of religious activity it's not in the heart of the elected lady [Applause] just with a different function than what you have we built a body it's a good uh it's a one body are we okay with that and every member of that body has a position the head is there to direct everything and we have received everything by grace the minister the ministry it's the grace of god the the gift of healing the vocal can do the the superior it doesn't make you any higher than others by grace that god gives a recipe and everything that we have received by grace only live but we don't lift it up because the same god who gives you grace will offer an important he can give it to somebody else too the pillar of fire has been identified in the same time amen the same pill of fire that led the children of israel the signs of the coming of the lord are palpable those things had to bring the sacredness among the believers there is no sacredness anymore [Music] it's the acclamation to to to to clap for the person who's preaching and i preach to you i say something good and you say i say i clap for the lord i don't believe it's the lord that we are clapping for ah it's not that's not christianity it's not a noise it's not concerts where they make everybody dance no no that's not christianity that's not what the world is looking for the world already has those concerts is worship just the atmosphere and she measured me and then my my friends sacrifice there's no sacredness even among those that believe this message there's no there's no the the respect of the visible respect there's the believers of this precious message so that the world may see the resurrected christ we believe in the christ who's alive because he's resurrected we're not telling stories we're not talking about the past year because it's the same yesterday today and foreign that we want to present to the world today hello mr me then my friend what that one said or what this one says that the message has not said we should have been happy with malachite four only there's not a great one somewhere who's supposed to tell us what we're supposed to do what we're supposed to do this message and let me say in its purity is revealing the presence of god in the believers they are people that are coming for the first time just the atmosphere just the atmosphere it changes the condition atmosphere why the atmosphere was something we are not denominationals [Music] we don't pay attention to the presence of god where we are in the sanctuary those people that are coming they're not coming to see a man even personally they come because god has spoken and that god whose fault he didn't go with william branham he's here so he can do a lot of things where sons and daughters of god are connected to the word of god christianity uh christ is coming back soon so he could take the his bride who's become the word he's giving us the faith of the rapture because soon will be taken out and i believe it's by the voice of the seven thunders that's what god said that the bride's supposed to take it only i i want you to be built up in the city the holy oracles of god in the faith love for the sitters the faith of this hour la for faith preach the it's going to take more faith that there never was in any age as in the other ages the reformation reformers they zoomed men who were thinking no but now say do you remember it's not william branham speaking it's god himself speaking of simplicity in the simplicity it's going to take more faith than we ever had in any age for it has to be rapturing faith put it on living to be taken out and show what we want we want that you believe what you believe tonight in all that you have seen mountain dew heard the word that you have heard preach the signs and the wonders that you have seen done that you accumulate all this together in your heart and consider it whether it's god or not [Applause] she said you if it's god or not i believe it's god he said if god is if god be god then serve him this is jesus and if jesus is the center of all things for the christians is he the center of all things for you it has to be that way if you want to go forward with god it has to be that way it has to be the center for your of your life it seems really something to choose and if jesus is the center of all things to the to the christians then i think we are we are let loose of everything else and cliff to him he is and the word always points to him william branham declares and the word always points to him people not to a man not to a group of men not to a tendency no no you'll remain with the word because god is always a guide let me say this the true christianity that the world is looking for identification is conditioned by the identification to christ it's possible to anyone who wants it say gratuity it's it's free whichever want can amen [Music] [Music] the life the visible life that we live among men is testifying of what about what's inside of you yes when we try to imitate what we don't have a fabric or to fabricate humility and the fruits of the spirits it always turns out to be hypocrisy to our side el and the christian world is full of hypocrisy but the word the message is here so it can bring us out of that you cannot fabricate christianity look it's an eastman christianity it's a life subject to the spirit that lives within us and it automatically brings out fruits le frivian automatic monsters they fall fruits comes automatically without any efforts and then there's no way to fabricate it many people try christianity most tried to get into the prayer line they've ever assisted foreign i will see if this time god is going to heal you don't try um [Music] and there are people that are most unstable and always floating wait yes to to try christianity it's to remain unstable it's to remain floating yes you see oh there's something over there you go yes they show this over there you go that's not a christian he knows who he is and whom he has believed in in a float path he doesn't float the christianity you don't get to try it it's a lived god looks at you as an individual what this member did or what the pastor did here does not affect the true member oh legalization oh that church i command you i'm sorry today it's not a group of people or a denomination look it's an ism the christianity it's the life that an individual lives under the influence of the holy ghost the pastor preaches to me the word it's a man with his own mistakes medulla but god placed him there i'm speaking to you i'm a pastor says respect if you don't respect the person respect tell a function respect the office it's god who placed them there if you were the best god would have put you here [Applause] i like to say things the way they are i think it is also unnecessary so people are honest when they are sitting there god loves honesty god loves loyalty [Music] i'm sorry that they that they debated these things christianity is not a debate today there is debate uh can you not see that um it's not to be debated [Music] the man kept calling me a healer j.d and i said i have never said that i was a healer i never said i could heal [Music] it's a divine gift from god that can that can that that can understand and know the things and and know things and tell me things that wars and things that is to come and i said certain discipline that's indisputable and it can be proven any time voyage and i said [Music] and that's way back years and years ago and i said but if you speak the truth god will honor the truth he said he will he will do more that christianity is not a selfish life it shows ego uh something uh uh a selfish something regardless of how bad the person is you want them to come in silver you want to attract everybody because he has the power to transform notice to see i want you to remember this well she took a philippine right after philip was saved he went to find somebody else his friend it was a good sign that he was saved and christianism when he went to look for somebody else that's what christianity is about lucianism christianity it's not what the i see or what we covered or what we lost after you know many churches are built by by lasso or covertness oh that man over there he doesn't even know how to speak oh he started here oh the church is going forward no cj pc i can do that too a calling of god and know what your calling is the basket do you append to you because god always calls don't do appel when god calls god will provide the one who sent you francois it takes you're not going to start rumors in the church no no that's not christianity then christianity it's not what the eyes see or what you covered after long racism personnel all the personal enrichment a a great build building with all kinds of luxurious it's the peace calm it's the uh it's the the coming forth or the adornment of the spirit of peace and it's because an adornment of spirit of peace savoir vivre to you express eternal life in your way of living respect the lord the respect of the order of the church that will bring forth a a wonderful worship of allah and to bring the world to recognize the presence of god in your midst amen but today christianity has changed so many forms uh you have to pamper or to baby people that's right no you

the christianity that the world is looking for [Music] how well you can sing or how well you can preach the word message but it's a hidden life a life that's hidden uh and consecrated and you are hidden in christ in god by christ you are sealed inside by the holy spirit christianity it's a life of sacrifice that that's that's what too many christians today the personality that people are they they are they lack personality they don't know the personality people i wish too many christians today they are are tempted they are so soft and they think that all they have to do says that it's to

[Music] and i wrote this this morning and and i hope that it sticks with you in the simplicity [Music] that it is christianity is the possession [Music] of the love of god that he loved you with if you would be to others what he was to you [Music] if you would love others the way he loved you christianity is possessing the forgiveness that he forgave you with [Music] just think of it christianity is possessing the kindness and the goodness that he showed to you christianity is to give what he gave you the best way to be christ-like is just to live the experience that you have with him i know god's forgive her you know i've never met a person and i don't believe that god [Music] can't save because i know what he saved me from i know how far he went down for me i know how much he loves me if i could love with that same love if i could forgive with that same forgiveness god's been good to me god been good if you can just be good the way he was good [Music] has he been kind if you could just be kind the way that he was be kind and then we can understand we're not we're not at war with the world we're at peace with god we don't fear the devil because we know that nothing can pluck us out of the palm if we could just go forth and let this love of god be shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit and if our hearts desire is as i've freely given you freely give go into all the world preach the gospel freely give what i've given to you don't spend too much time looking at yourself you'll just get worse every time i look in the mirror i'm not getting more handsome but every time i look up i know i've got one coming i've got a body let's live for him this morning let's have faith let's go let's go show the world what he's done for us what he saved us from what
