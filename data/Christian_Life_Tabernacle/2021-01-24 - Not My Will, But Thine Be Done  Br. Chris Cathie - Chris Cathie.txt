Description:
Not My Will, But Thine Be Done
Br. Chris Cathie
Sunday Evening Service: January 24,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

heart to the lord and i just want to thank him and i pray that this will be real to you young ones that if you haven't given your heart to the lord i gave him my heart when i was just a child and i

you're an old veteran so thank you uh when just the home folk come out and and you know the rain keeps the people away and other things keep them away and then when you get out here you know that the lord's gonna be here and i i really i'm really excited tonight you know sometimes god's had services just for me see i don't know what he meant by that but i i said it i said it and it's the the the truth so uh we we certainly uh uh uh certainly believe that's true but anyway uh uh i i so i had two two preachers today so uh i appended i have to invite them both back but i've asked brother chris to bring the message tonight but i've asked brother uh ben david his real name's reggie but they don't call him that for some reason so they call him ben david so but i guess his real name's reggie but uh i i really had identifying it like his a wife said today you know everybody says they call him reggie platt and uh uh but his name's plet i believe it's the right way right well that's like me everybody calls me mcgeary you know mcgeary and it's not mcgeary it's geary you know so okay you know they never say it right and so then i got really kind of chuckled because uh you know they said we're not platts we're plaits so anyway i don't know if that has any effect on the things that you say brother but i definitely want you to come up here and say something to us with your right name so anyway this is reggie ben david platt he's gonna come he's a minister in in arizona up there in flagstaff and uh so i've asked him to come up and and just greet us and give us a word of exhortation take a few moments to say everything and and of course then being a minister i looked over at brother chris i said now i'm going to have brother reggie come up and walk all over your sermon before you preach and and i said but if it's fresh manna you just bring it just the way that that god give it to you and it'll be really good so come on up brother and and it's just wonderful to have you it's wonderful to feel the presence of the lord and it's wonderful to enjoy the things of the lord good to see brother randy tonight whether randy god bless you we're happy i guess you're back on the battlefield all right so we got a little thin on preachers around here for a while so it's nice to have a brother randy back with us amen brother god bless you because feel what's on your heart thank you god bless you this evening saints i sure enjoyed this service thus far and i enjoyed the service this morning i had a chance afterwards to uh fellowship a little bit with brother andrew and and i certainly enjoyed uh speaking with him and and sharing a little bit of testimony back and forth with him and just have enjoyed every every portion of this and of course most importantly the spirit of the lord to be able to to feel that here i was thinking is that as our sister was singing that song he has forgiven me the first time i ever heard that song was from one of my sunday school students who had had an experience with the lord and she was a high school student when i was teaching her in sunday school and then she became a dear friend of of ours and and that was sister charity mcgeary and when she sang that song for the first time i i've ever heard that song was from her and i knew that she'd had an experience with the lord and that the lord had certainly forgiven her and i knew what that was like to have that forgiveness and i just wanted to share maybe just a little bit of that testimony with you here um my exhortation to you parents would be don't ever name your child with four names because nobody will ever know what to call them my my name is reginald ben david pled my dad is also reginald and so while i was growing up they didn't want the name reginald flying around the house and have two people yelling answering and so they called me by my middle name which is ben david and so growing up everyone knew me has been david but as i got a little more independent in school you know my first name was reggie and i wanted to be identified by my first name and so consequently some were calling me reggie and some were calling me ben david and then as the lord called me to be a minister of the gospel people were saying well brother reggie this brother reggie this and others were saying brother ben david this and they said who is who are they talking about that's a good thing yeah it is a good thing brother david i'm hoping that i tell people this i hope one of these days that you get a flyer for a set of meetings and there's going to be a brother reggie preaching a brother ben preaching a brother david preaching and everybody's so excited because they get to hear three different preachers but it'll just be the one and uh but i had uh i had a scripture that i wanted to share with you all um it's in amos chapter 5. and it starts uh at verse 21 and reads to the end of the chapter and not a very uh not a very familiar scripture i don't know that i've ever heard a sermon built from this scripture it starts off i hate and so you're not going to hear a lot of sermons built from from that scripture but it says i hate i despise your feast days and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings i will not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will not hear the melody of thy viles but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream have ye offered unto me a sac me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness 40 years o house of israel but you have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and chiam your images the star of your god which you made to yourselves therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord whose name is the god of hosts i was fortunate enough to be raised under the pews of a message believing church and my parents received the message of the hour when i was just a baby in california and like brother david then they the only church they heard of they just asked the minister well where's the church that that teaches or preaches this and somebody just said well we know there's one in flagstaff arizona so they said that's good enough so they moved to flagstaff and that's where i grew up and i uh i uh boy i knew the quotes i i knew all the buzz words i knew all the cliches um i knew i knew about the seals i knew about marriage and divorce as a child i could i could have hung with the best of the preachers but i never met the god of this message and um and i was the worst kind of a of a message a child i was a hypocrite i i used to judge every schoolmate that claimed to know christianity i used to judge them as a remnant as a tribulation fodder that i knew what the truth was and they didn't and pour them but i never knew the god of the message of this hour and there was i knew the story of the eagle that flew over the barnyard i knew that that man had a a nest of eggs under a chicken and he needed a full setting so he went and got an eagle egg to finish that setting i knew that eagle had hatched in a chicken yard and that that eagle was pecking at chicken food i knew that he always felt odd and i knew that one day and mother eagle would fly over that nest and screamed and called to that chicken or to that eagle out of the chicken yard and i knew all of the believers like brother david and my parents who could identify with that story that said that was us we came out of denominations we came out of the denominational chicken yard and we were called into a higher place to be eagles but i was raised on the views of a message believing church i didn't know about the chicken yard i didn't know about i'd visited probably more denominational churches than most believers have ever have ever visited so i understood this story but it didn't was not applicable to my life but i found out as i as the lord began to deal with my heart that brother branham tells more than one eagle story you realize that in that eagle's nest there was more than one egg there's a couple eggs in that nest and he tells the story about the egg that remained in that nest and he said that that eagle that hatches in the nest of the eagle nest they've got to be hatched out and when they're hatched out they're hatched out in a nice comfortable rabbit fur lined nest and how comfortable it is and how that all these young people that are raised in a nice wonderful message church are are are hatched out in a rabbit fur-lined nest and oh how they know what an eagle talks like they know what an eagle looks like they know all there is to know about eagles but they don't know what it is to be an eagle and so brother branham said that one day that mother eagle has to begin to take the fur out of the nest and that that little eagle has got to feel the pricks under their feet for themselves to get so uncomfortable that they've got to leave the nest and he said that that little eagle gets so uncomfortable in the nest it's got nowhere else to go but to learn to set his wings and one day mother eagle will come down and take that little eaglet on her wings and say it's time to go for a ride and he said that she'll take that eagle out there and take it up in the highest of heights and many of the young people have gone to many a message camp have gone to many a message church and they have experienced what it is to fly on the wings of an eagle to feel the presence of god but they've never known what it is for themselves to be an eagle until that mother eagle turns their life upside down and dumps them off of her wings and when mama eagle takes and dumps them off that eagle has experiences real panic it experiences i'm not being carried anymore by mom and by dad what am i supposed to do and that's when jehovah eagle says you've got to flap your own weakness you've got to learn what it is and before that eagle can hit the ground jehovah eagle will swing underneath that eagle and she'll take those eagles back up again and say now we're gonna do it again until you learn to fly and when i was growing up on on a message pew when i was criticizing all the other children that that went to churches that that probably had had an experience with the lord i was in the seat of the scornful condemning them until one day my senior year of high school i was at a state track meet and i'd already determined my course i was set for hollywood i was set for new york city i already knew the course that i was going to take and i thought that i had that planned out and it was certainly uh did not involve the message of the hour but one day i woke up it was after a state track meet i was up 18 years old and i everybody was going to breakfast and breakfast just didn't sound good to me in fact their food just did not sound appealing to me at all and i thought this is a strange feeling in my heart and so i took a bus ride from phoenix up to flagstaff and i thought i don't know what this feeling is that's inside of me and i thought well i know it'll ease that if i put on some of my worldly music maybe that'll comfort me so i put on my worldly music and it made me sick to my stomach and i couldn't handle that music anymore and so i shut it off and i thought what is wrong with me and by the time i got to flagstaff there was only one thing that was screaming out in my heart and that was i've got to get home and find a bible and i thought i surely my mom and dad have got a bible in my house you know there's got to be lots of bibles in the house and so i ran to my room and i grabbed the bible and i thought oh god i know it's you i know you're calling i know that you're you're pulling on me and i thought lord if that's you i need you to talk to me and i wanted and i i didn't know where to turn i didn't i didn't know where to even look in the bible so i just took the bible and i opened it up and i inside i think i was probably hoping for john 3 16. god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and i just thought i wanted something that would say that i love you and instead this is where i turned was in amos chapter 5. and it let me know that i hate your feasts that you give to me and i hate your music i won't listen to the music you're listening to and as he began to take and strip me down and take me to the backside of the desert and absolutely expose me and take everything that i thought that i was and he began to strip it away and the humiliation as he began to strip my life and he began to show me that what it is is what you need is a spanking what you need is a desert you need to know what this is about and you need nowhere else to turn but to god you need to be an eagle that's been dumped off of those wings and feels helpless and hopeless and you need to look up and see jehovah eagle is your father is your mother is your sister is your brother is your all in all and he wanted me to look to him and to him only and as i began to read this and i began to see how wrong i had been and what a filthy life that i had had lived even behind the name of the message of the hour using that for a crutch i got to that last verse therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus and i realized that that's exactly the road that paul was on when the lord found him we was on that road to damascus all in the name of religion to go to kill christians and when i the lord revealed these scriptures to me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and there in that bedroom in my bedroom as i realized that when it said that you have borne the tabernacle of moloch and chiam your images the star of your god boy i thought i was going to be a star a hollywood star i thought i was going to be a great television star a movie star and i realized that the star that of the god that i had made was the star of hollywood the the the the hollywood stars on that on the walk of of hollywood and those images that i had were posters of idols that i had hanging in my bedroom those were the images that i had set up was my own idea of what a star was and god began to strip those things out of my life and those posters began to come down out of my room and the television out of my life and all the things that i had held on to that were worldly they had to go away and they went straight to the dumpster they i i didn't even want anybody to know about that music so i took all that cd collection and i drove into town and i found a dumpster and i all went into the dumpster and everything i had had to go into the dumpster and god began to call me and show me that though you may not know what the chicken yard is of the denominations you're still an eagle and young people though you may be raised in a message church you're an eagle and you need to know you're an eagle god wants to show you you're an eagle he wants to take you to the same heights that he took the one from the chicken yard and he took them to he wants you to set your wings as well and to realize that you too are an eagle and that you can hear the scream of the eagle and that you can recognize this is what i was made for that that that the nest then even though it doesn't have the rabbit's fur anymore it's still an eagle's nest and you now can come into that eagle's nest it's a it's a strange land with strange people who speak a strange language and you find out you end up singing i'm one of them i'm one of them so god bless you i don't want to take any time i know you'll enjoy brother chris he's a real preacher and uh and and we we want to hear from a real preacher now so god bless you all [Applause] i enjoyed that man that's very very very very good very inspirational all right well i i rather chris kathy's going to preach from me and i has given him a hard time in my office i said i heard you from memphis he says no i'm from memphis indiana i said you sell fake grass and you live in a fake memphis [Applause] he says brother but i got a real gospel i am a man so now i hear he's a real preacher oh man i'm set tonight aren't i i get we're going to have a wonderful time in the lord i i think what's so beautiful about what uh reginald said to us that's what i'm calling you for now on brother you're reginald to me it is that everybody that belongs to him has an experience that god has for them and it's such a beautiful individual affair and we could probably have testimony after testimony everybody standing up telling us how that they came to that wing shaking in their life where they took that flight and it's so a wonderful thing so i guess we don't really have to have a song to sing i i like that thought i'm one of them i thought i'd sing that and then i thought you know a real preacher don't need nothing but a pulpit right amen so god thank you we have a saying here without fear and without favor that's wonderful to hear i'll tell you have a wonderful message yeah right here okay god bless you it's good to be here thank you brother david brother reggie really good friend of mine i just always love to hear him speak and just most of all i want to hear god speak tonight you know i come here to god i come prepared you know i just you brother graham said you get out of the service what you come expecting so i come to hear from me not for me tonight but guys we come to your word tonight may become a just off the pages tonight father that i may not be speaking tonight but you'll be speaking father through lips of clay god we are the clay you're the partner father your word says that father we claim that today we asked you to speak to our hearts tonight you would just rather bind the spirit lord anyone sick that they would come believe here well father that someone's come to press they maybe leave it here father and leave it and just go on and be well in you father god we love you lord jesus we thank you for this wonderful message you brought forth lord in this last day god we're living in a great hour father but god we just look for your coming at any time father all the signs are turning that way lord as you would just prepare parents prepare us as you're preparing the bride father you're making her ready lord god make us ready tonight we love you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you we're going to turn to luke thank you turn to luke tonight luke luke 22 luke 22 the 39th verse we can stand luke 22 verse 39 i'll give you a minute to get there all right luke 22 39. it says and it came out and went as he as he was as he want to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray ye that you enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if i be with he says father if thou be willing remove this cup from from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared in angel unto him from heaven strengthening him you know aren't you thankful that we have a god that sends angels that strengthens us when we go through troubles and we go through trials that you know we might not we we might not see what we're going through at the moment but the angel of the god is standing there he's strengthening you you might be going through a sickness or a depression or whatever it is and we just stop and say god i need you right now and you know i just love what he says he says and there appeared in angel unto him from heaven not just jesus but the bride of christ tonight saying he's strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his he said and his sweats were as a great drops of blood flowing down to the ground and when he arose from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray least ye enter into temptations you may be seated you know i was thinking on verse 42 tonight he said saying father if thou be willing to remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and as i was just thinking this morning as brother david was preaching it was just wonderful and it it made me think he talked about not not my i'm about my father's business and i and i kind of just was praying this afternoon and i came over and was thinking about the scripture and not my will but nine be done and i think us as christians today we we we need a more of a surrender life in christ and i believe we're we're in a great great battle in the late hour but you know as we travel and travel and travel i you know i didn't grow up in the message church i grew up in a broken up home that didn't know jesus and didn't have jesus didn't didn't know nothing about jesus but i tell you like he said that that great chicken yard i was in the chicken yard and he that great uh mother eagle came and got me came and i heard the voice and that deep caught to the deep to respond to and i'll tell you tonight if you're sitting in a church and you you hear the message of the hour you're blessed you're a blessed church tonight you know i tell you i didn't grow up with all that i grew up in a in a mixed up home that got divorced at six six years old i came to a bus stop and daddy and mommy were getting divorced and i didn't want that to happen and the officers came and and they said hey who do you pick and i i said i want both of them my brother said one person my my sister said i said i want both of them and i realized that we all come up shaped in the world speaking lies and sin and everything in our lives but god changes us you know god put something in us tonight to come to the house of god and you know in the late hour you drive down you see all these churches as we were driving over here the doors were shut and you think about how many churches are even having church i tell you the devil is all in this covenant he's talking about the covenant 19 the clover 20 whatever it is but i just have to go back to the bible and says what the bible says you know he didn't say we wouldn't get sick but he will deliver us out of all our troubles out of everything you have need of tonight he will deliver you tonight whatever you have need you came to depression you can leave it leave it here tonight and leave weft or whatever you have need of tonight we just gotta trust the god that was in that man to come in us you know he didn't just come down and come in brother branham he's got a vessel tonight that he wants to fill but you know sometimes we have our we have our vessels they're still dirty and we need to fill them up tonight that more than just you know just halfway feeling but let god fill you from the head to the toe and fill your life and you just truly surrender life to god and let him use a clean vessel he wants a clean vessel tonight that he can work through that you could be god with skin on and out here that's what people want to see they don't want to hear what you got to say they want to see a life behind the name like brother abraham says the light behind the name makes the devil tremble and i'll tell you we've got to get above this tonight that we're that we're more than conquerors in christ jesus that we're not just coming through this world or just passing through you're meant to be here oh god saw you and laid out a cnn age this last stage tonight to raise up and say i'm going home i'm fighting through brother said every inch you're going to fight for every inch every battle every time you you get in a situation there's a battle just another battle you gotta face or another storm brother man has it it is it is uh it talks about hey i don't wanna learn how to go through the storm but i just wanna learn how to dance in the rain and i tell you i was using the restroom of the day i was dancing in there i said praise god i said because i want to learn how to dance in it he says i want to glory in my tribulations oh they're precious than gold and i tell you church we got to get back to the word and get a more surrendered life for jesus and get more about his business than our business or caught up in our jobs or or things of the world but say god i want to be about your business i want a more surrender life lord and i think we all can get in that even myself tonight we can get a more surrendered life to jesus tonight a more a dedicated what do we have we have 1200 tapes on every sermon and whatever it is to point us back to christ to point us back to the word of god tonight and brother braham says in the token message he said the message he said the message is christ here's what he says church the message is christ church out of everyone else i tell you they would die just to have their eyes out clear tonight but i tell you sometimes i feel like some of the message believers come around here and they have film on their eyes they walk around with filmy eyes but i tell you we should get the film off tonight and say lord i thank you for choosing me i thank you for predestinating a seed inside of me that just came to the deep call to the deep tonight that when he heard the deep he responded to that it was more than just hey i just a little tickling or just something that but a deep responded to the deep brother brown says he i love his quote he said god only wants a man that he can fully get in him his complete control he said that's right a man that's fully surrendered to him and i believe we gotta get more sincere we're in the late hour i was telling someone the other day i said you know you know they talked about the quarantine and cover 19 and you got to be quarantined and i tell you what god's still getting the praise tonight because they started saying you got to get quarantined you know i said i said you know i've been quarantined throughout the whole bible i said even in the ark they went two by two and they got quarantined in the ark and then when the when the storm came and he flooded the earth they were quarantined with jesus and i tell you tonight you've got to get quarantined with jesus you got to get a true sincere walk the ravens fed elijah he went down the brook by himself he got quarantined but he still was fed whole church john the other patmos tonight he went to the isle of patmos they tried to get rid of him tonight but they couldn't get rid of him no matter what they kept doing to him he was quarantined tonight i'll tell you church we need to get quarantined with jesus we need to get so filled up and folks surrendered with jesus that we need to get all just one accord tonight he's wanting to speak to someone tonight he's wanting you to speak back to him he's just not wanting you to walk through life but he wants you to talk to him and say god hey speak to me tonight that's why he says you get you got two ears and one mouth just just be quiet sometimes and let the let the lord tell you what he wants to tell you let him tell you what he wants to tell you tonight whole but like brother brahm says he says in this message i love what he said he said this is from that time the message and this message he talks about the the the bulls and the calves and he said they started getting the irons out and they marked with the with the with the numbers and they started realizing who they were from he could identify but i tell you you're identified tonight with jesus christ you're identified with that pillar of fire the same i tell you we are identified with it with the best the word of god we identified that brother brown come down and just revealed the word of god all opened it all up the seals the seals were already there as my brother was saying back there he just he just came into it he just spoke the word and he was just a manifestation of god used a man a prophet to bring the word of god and to open their eyes and to peel the peel it back and become a love language to us oh we should be the happiest people probably said that christians should be the happiest person but i tell you i want to think about tonight i was thinking about what is our purpose of being here what is our purpose on here not just just to come to church or come through the doors and make it a tradition not just oh we got to be at church but to come expecting every time the doors are open or get on my knees and well i'm going to get in just get in your knees and say lord i need to hear from you tonight no matter who's speaking lord i ask you i want to draw closer to you there's something in my life that you need to take away oh lord keep clothing me lord and i think we got to get that in our lives that the bride he says the bride is making herself ready now every day i think there's another day that i can make myself ready for this rapture oh this whole sweet homecoming whole church when the when you're at the wedding something he walks by and wipes your eyes and he wipes your eyes and says it's finished it's over oh what a what a day of rejoicing that will be oh and my savior i shall see oh and i said look upon this face oh church can you think about that tonight just let it go through your mind you won't care about your job you won't care about your car you don't care about your house because i'm going to a city that makers god a city that we were predestinated for tonight uh that a seed got watered one day and you're sitting in the house of goddess i tell you it's not a time to play church it's a time to get a purpose for god and get to get a surrendered life to jesus brother baby says he said there's only one form of eternal life and that comes from god he said it's for he said ordained every creature that would ever have it just as you were the gene in your father you was a you was a gene of god he said one of his attributes to begin with or you'll never be there leadership i tell you church we were think about it we were before god but before the before the stars were placed he knew who you were tonight he just saw that he needed to put a little bit of water on it and say hey come out of the chicken yard as my brother was saying tonight hey i grew up in the church i grew up with hey you know what quit just quoting tapes i can't quote all the message books but i tell you it's time to live for jesus christ it's time to rise up and not just say i'm in a message or just say i'm quoting the book or i'm just toting the book what's that mean it's more than just saying i mean the message i tell you it's more than just saying i'm going to give you a quote tonight it's truly being letting the word be change your life then manifest in you and let god speak out of you and you can be an encouragement to god or someone in your workplace even if they're not in the message because it could be that very last seat that we're waiting to get out of here because you hadn't said nothing to god so when you're your friend that or maybe maybe it's not the right time but they're just watching your life they're just watching everything about you your kids are everything you everywhere you go someone's watching you but i tell you it's time to get a surre a really surrendered life and say lord not my will but thyme be done lord not my will but time be done and we just i just was thinking tonight that we have a representation tonight just not sitting in pews tonight that we're not sitting we're representing jesus christ tonight we are walking epistles made they're all man we are i'll tell you when jesus feels your vessel tonight young people best that like bro like the bible says he is the greatest benefit you could ever have tonight i tell you once you meet jesus i'm telling you it's the best thing ever happened to me grew up in a broke up home i still try to tell my dad about the word he said son you got you lost your mind i said well call me an odd bod all oddball but y'all just keep preaching the word and i tell you every malachi everything was in the scriptures i just i said dad let's go back to the bible well i don't see that on i said that it's written in the bible i don't know you can't see baptism because you know i just keep praying for them and i just claim them tonight and i just claim them tonight by the blood of jesus christ i claim my inheritance tonight i tell you church we got to claim our inheritance and realize who we are that we're not just we're not just just children passing through but we we saw a great line this day but he wants to live in you tonight brother bram says he said you come forth in the bedding ground of your mother he said your father didn't know you you were in his loins he said and when you came forth in the bedding ground of your mother he said then you became a human being and it made you in the image of your father he said now you can fellowship with him he said in the same thing by god if you guide eternal life the life he says the life you come in the natural life physical life he said that was by your father he said and the only way you could come born again is the only way he said it has to be the form for your heavenly father his attributes he said all the father has given me will come to me see he said you are here you are here tonight because your name was placed in the last book of life aren't you thankful tonight he says therefore was he the foundation of the world he said he's the lamb's book of light before there was even a foundation of the world he said that's exactly right you're a gene a spiritual gene out of your heavenly father he said a part of god's word he said that's so he said that be so i said he said you was with jesus he says when he was here because he was the word he said you suffered with them you died with them you buried with them you rose with them and now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh church we're not just sitting in church we're sitting in heavenly places tonight we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus called church they should put something in you i'm not talking about 1987 octane 92 i'm talking about an octane you can the holy ghost will give you will fill you tonight or if you came for a feeling he'll or another refilling tonight he'll refill you whole church the fountains open tonight if you need jesus tonight come get some jesus tonight let him fill your life let let you get a more prayer life i don't know what it is tonight is it your prayer life now i'm not talking about a two-minute prayer i'm talking about getting on your knees and saying lord i cry out till you speak to me like brother brown speaks about buddy robson he said he wasn't leaving that cornfield until he got filled and no matter if his bones set there he's going to get filled with the holy ghost and i tell you it's a surrendered life to jesus and knowing what he does and letting that become a reality i tell you ain't nothing negative about jesus you see anything about negative you were once negative but when that when he came and came and put down that cross it turned positive and i'm thankful tonight that we have a positive sign tonight that we can look to tonight that are having a review mirror at home and all the cars and i look to it and i say thank you lord i thank you lord for turning my negative to a positive that i could not live negative but i can live positive because jesus come down and dwell in a body hole with no sin think about it tonight for me and you tonight because i believe when he was on the cross i believe he saw every one of us tonight i believe he looked i think about the clouds he could have called 10 million legions of angels but he saw a bride tonight he saw through the foundation of the world that you're sitting here tonight they said hey i got children tonight that i gotta die for oh but i'm glad he rose on that third day i'm glad he was about his father's business are we about our father's business tonight are we more than just about our our work our job but are we about our father's business are we getting a true walk with jesus tonight whole church the position of the believer ain't under the devil tonight we want to do that sometimes let devil have the rain but you know what we need to look we need to put the devil under our feet and when we walk we need to walk like this and let the devil have some of it sometimes hold church he'll be fighting monday morning i know you get on your jobs everywhere else but i tell you put the devil under your feet tonight and say greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i don't care what you bring covered 19 cover 20. i still trust your word tonight i'll take your word for whatever it is i'm like sister had it right when she when brother brown was speaking he said that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but the truth this message is nothing but the truth i tell you church right he said you can have anything you want money i want the salvation of my voice and then you know here comes the critics they're like oh do you know where her boys are they're in the world i don't care where they are i don't care where they are don't say brother chris well they're out here i don't care because he said you could have them i tell you church we got to start treating the word of god like that and when he says when you're healed and he says lay hands on the sick hey come to church lay their hands on you oh get in the car and they say say brother david just put hands on me tonight he even say pray just lay hands on me i had a headache the other day i was hurting real bad we heard the wedding isaac come by i was sitting there isaac said come here daddy let me just lay hands on you i said praise god and not even about two or three minutes later the headache started to go away he had to remind me that i needed hands laid on me hold trust he'll use whatever he has to he'll speak through whatever rock a donkey it don't matter but you know what he'll make the rocks cry out but you know what it's time for us to let it cry out tonight and say god i want to be used i want to be a vessel for you i don't want the donkey to cry i don't want the rocks to cry i want chris to cry i want to love jesus more than i did yesterday whole church but we live in a rearview mirror life we live in the rearview mirror life you know how big the windshield is you look in the windshield look at the river try driving down the road in the rearview mirror you'll hit everything i do trying to back up trying to back these big trailers up and you use the rear view mirrors like why am i even using this can't even see out of it anyway but you know what you know where the rearview mirrors for it's just for reference it's just to show you what you used to be it's just to show you where you used to be oh wait then you look out through that glorious big old windshield and you go oh that's how i used to be aren't you thankful tonight that you ride down the road and you go i used to be there but now i'll keep coming but i used to do that but god you changed my heart and now we need to start using the windshield tonight not as a guide we need to use the word of god as our guide tonight and say god give me a more surrender life i'll tell you i believe the ark is closing i believe the door is shutting so many years have went by work just keep saying well what's going to happen in the 70s i've been in our 60s and whatever just throughout the whole time oh it's going to happen it's going to happen i know you got to keep holding your potatoes but i'll tell you tonight i'll tell you the signs are pointing i'll tell you how corrupt different things are getting in place and all these prophecies that's been said are just coming right down the line that's already been spoken we're just it's already manifesting itself and the things that are picking in the transgender and all this mess is just corruption and it shouldn't make you sick to your stomach tonight it should make your belly go oh jesus come quickly lord i get in the car say lord that ain't number filth come quickly lord but at once once stuff you love you hate but when you hear the word of god in these messages it should do something to you it should wrap something up in you and put a desire to love god more love one another more love your neighbor the whole church brother said he said and then after a while you heard the gospel he said you maybe you maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to nomination same thing brother rudy was saying he said but one day i love that but one day but one day you being part of god he said you had part two of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you come from and you know that was the truth he said you were always the seed and he said was it was in you always he says the word seen the word that was in you and he says that was before the foundation of the world he said he saw the word and you come to it whole church aren't you thankful you came to it tonight but he wants someone to be dedicated to the word of god and say lord it's not just a book of oh i gotta do this or i gotta do that but when you see us a love language and you start to realize lord i'm in love with you and your wife says hey would you go do this or hey would you mind taking out the trash oh sweetheart i will do that i'll go do this or i'll do that but you start to realize when you love somebody you only have to ask you just do it or the wife will just iron this or do that or wash the dishes and she does it out of love and our father tonight wants a dedicated life say lord whatever you say i'll do it i might not like it i might not there's some things lord just take it out of my life but god says hey do this don't cut your hair don't wear makeup this and that young young kids weather don't get in your mind the devil wants to take you down a path that he cannot try to bring you back he wants to just destroy your life but i'm here to tell you young people get a dedicated life get a life so surrendered to jesus that you step on the devil that you step on the devil and you look through the windshield tonight and say lord i'm living for you i'm telling you tonight i've been down the road that he'll take you farther than you want to go longer than you want to stay he'll take you so far young people tonight that i tell you get surrendered to jesus it's the best thing that i could it might have been later in life for me i was in the military for eight years i lived in fort bliss texas all over and then coming through the military this and that then finally about the age of about 22 years old i i met jesus and you know what brother brown says about uh moses he said he in five minutes presence of his time he got five minutes in the presence changed his whole life it don't take a whole lot of time and ain't no time clutch when you brother was speaking this morning on the presence of god it made me think in my seat i said lord i want more of your presence i want to be not just come to church but i need more of your presence i want to notice your presence and i want to get in your presence god you feel me more tonight but i tell you we got to get that way where we say lord i don't want any of this world i don't want any of this world take it all out of me but we got to get a serious dedicated life to jesus forget the forget the things of the world but no we got to provide and we got to do this for our family but i tell you we are blessed people tonight we are blessed people tonight first corinthians i was thinking 12 3 wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god call it jesus accursed he said and no man can say that jesus is lord but by the holy ghost aren't you glad tonight that you if you were filled tonight or if you hadn't been filled i encourage you to get filled tonight brother talks about one place he says it's like a big ocean he said he just wants to give you the holy spirit so much he's like it's an ocean going through a pipe you imagine the ocean going through a pipe that's how much he wants to fill you tonight that big ocean just pushing down on you he's wanting to fill you tonight he don't want to he's came to save the he he's ca he's came to save the lost he's ca he said whosoever come maybe not all of us come or some of the worlds in the world's come but you know what i tell you there's light in goshen tonight there's light tonight there might be a lord you know that song the lighthouse i'll tell you what there's light in the house tonight there might not be all these churches doors are closed brother was talking about building the church and this and that i'm thinking well there's about plenty of churches left now because colgan 19 all this they don't even go to church anymore they just stay in their pajamas it's sad but i'm just telling you the truth they stay in their pajamas i'm there's a person in my family that called me they oh bro she's he said chris it's just they're not even though they're just in the kind of the world and they said you know it's so wonderful just to get up now in my pajamas i wanted to puke oh yo i thought the way i'd go back to the word i said well the bible says that's my shay i've been saying that lately i said what the bible says go go more in the days approaching as you see the day approaching go more i'll tell you i'm going to ear on the side of the word of god the heavens and earth will not pass away but my word will not and i believe we got to get clothed in the word of god and become one with it and become about our father's business i love what brother brown said he said in this in this quote he said now man he said i was going to choke he said but i'm going to say it a man is omnipotent he said you don't believe that but he is he said a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotence he said did not he say mark 11 22 whosoever things you say and don't down in your heart it'll come to pass he said you can have what you've said and i was looking up often empty earlier and it says listen it says having unlimited power having unlimited power i'm not talking about a god a god can do anything for you tonight you got a sickness you leave well oh church i don't care what you came with tonight you have unlimited power in jesus christ if you took on his name you were baptized by jesus christ and your name was changed you call on jesus tonight but it said the definition i looked up right before i came it said having unlimited power hold church we got to believe we got to stop living down here and stop living like we in there we want to go hang in the chicken yard but come back to the eagle yard but we got to get out of that and say look i'm tired of that chicken pan i'm tired of that mess god's calling us to live a higher life god's calling us to live a lot higher life if we could get surrendered to jesus and say lord i need more of you take this from me take this from me and brother brahma said he said he knows exactly the devil knows exactly where to punch and he says to cover that spot i'm paraphrasing tonight for time but he says cover it he says what happens with two omnipotents meet he said when god and man comes together too omnipotent something's got to shake he said whosoever he said whatsoever you'd say with that creative power omnipotence of god knowing that he prompt promised it he said his word he creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass [Music] oh church he brings things to pass when you ask for something of jesus tonight he brings it to pass he makes the red sea depart he makes sicknesses go away he heals blinded uh he said he's the same yesterday today and forever oh christine a god of history i'll tell you the the founder the statue of a perfect man all this stuff that was brought forth ain't history it's something to listen to and say lord change me but he said i love what he said he said he promised i was shouting for glory earlier he said he said it is he said right i'm coming back to it he said whosoever you'd say with this create a power omnipotence of god knowing that he promised it and he said his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes he said them as they as they were as they are because two omnipotents have met but first a man fully must be fully surrendered there it is a man must be fully surrendered a sister must be fully surrendered just like a just like a like a wife surrenders to her head ship to her husband and then he submits his head to the lord i tell you we gotta get more surrender life and say lord i take whatever it is but then we still we're still on the age we got to tell you to kick the tvs out i don't understand it while we got sick stay in the abc's telling people to still kick the tv out when he said he'd blow it out with a shotgun i don't get it i don't understand it but oh but you know what he's he's kindly put it in our pocket now he didn't say nothing about netflix and hulu and on facebook i'll tell you you want to get facebook get your face in this book tonight you want facebook get your face in this book it'll change your life it'll make you talk different act different it'll give you power from on high you don't need the power from the facebook you need this facebook you need your face in this book [Applause] i'll tell you i'm trying to hear about facebook and twitter and all these accounts get your account with jesus oh church you want thanks i'll tell you he says you can create a power he says you can have things that he'll go and create for you you know brother i tell you it wasn't just for brother branham there's a bride of christ that he's got tonight that is for you too oh he wants to you start creating eyes and all this he's the same yesterday today and forever we got to stop limiting jesus christ that was in the pumpkins vision 1960. he said but a man must be fully surrendered to god a man must be fully surrendered to god but i tell you we got to get our face in this book we got to get our lives lined up with every scripture and say lord you take everything out of me every day i get up i say lord oh i said i'll say this or i popped off and said something oh lord uh sweetheart would you forgive me or whatever it is there's gonna be something always that's that's just it's got that dog in you that which dog you feed the most but we need to feed the dog that that that loves jesus we need to fill it with these messages every day i'll tell you he asked brother i was having a brother uh jim ed dalton's and he said he said brother give me a daughter and he said he asked brother branham you know he thought a big old revelation would come out and he goes well what's the biggest two things what's the biggest thing i could be to be a christian what's the best thing i can do bear he said he was very competitive and he asked brother brandon brother brahm said you know what he thought he'd come up with a big old revelation or some kind of theology whatever it was but he said you know read your bible and pray every day read your bible and pray every day i'm not talking about just reading one scripture tonight i'm talking about get submersed in it and let it become you and let it become one with you let it change your life we want to know all we got broke up homes because our face is not in this book our face is in the book of internet and twitter and all this mess that you hear about i'm not saying go out there and have a normal life and and fellowship and have a good time but i tell you get in this book i'll tell you once you get in the book and it starts to change your life and clothe you that's all you want you just start reading and say lord lord that's in my life take it from me or this is in my life or this but a surrendered life to jesus your kids are watching tonight i love what he says right here look this up he says sometimes we do things that we don't understand our own things he said if we are led by the spirit of god every child of god in my hearing he said or hearing my voice rather knows that sometimes that you do things that you think yourself is ridiculous when you become he said so closed in with god when the holy spirit gets you in such a condition to your fully surrendered to him he said i've seen men so filled with the devil until it takes several men to hold them he said and then if satan could put that kind of power on a man fully surrendered to him he said how much more can the power and the holy spirit put on a man that surrendered to him to make a person in a wheelchair rise and walk to make a shadow of a man dying with cancer get off the cot and jump from his feet screaming under the power of god whole church always surrendered i tell you there's no gray line there's no great lines it's either jesus christ or it's the devil you're not living in the middle tonight you're not living lukewarm tonight you're leaving for jesus you know your life you know you're fully surrendered to jesus or you're full of surrender to the devil tonight that's like that the the guy that ramped your brother brandon fell over his feet and the officer asked him he said uh you don't want me to do anything no he's he's he's he's he's worshipping the devil his he's fully surrendered to the devil church we gotta watch what we're watching watching today what our kids are doing i'll tell you be be thankful always the devil's always trying to get a little inch in or get something in before you know it it's just this full-blown thing that's in the house or whatever it is but when you just stay in the word of god and say lord i want more of you or stay on her knees more and say lord now i'm not just talking about a one-minute prayer i'm talking about getting serious with god and saying god i need more of you i want you you could change an old baptist boy that was with a broke up home he could change anybody family that's broke up wherever i went i i couldn't even sign up the military quick enough i said lord tom dad i brought the little sheep to him he said where are you going son i said i'm leaving this house i said dad sign this waiver i need to go to the military cause this house is ate up he got so mad at me but i tell you it was the best thing ever happened to me it straightened me up real quick but i'll tell you the best thing that really happened to me is when i met jesus and when i when i heard that when i heard the prophet my grandmother one time she's 83 years old today she's the only one she handed me two messages right before i left for the basic training she handed me a jezebel religion and why were you denying a nomination i wore them tapes out and it wore me out i tell you what but i needed it but there's sometimes we got to get fully surrendered to god say lord whatever it is take it from me if it's what i'm looking at it's what i'm doing and what take it from it get take that desire from it we got to put the devil back in his place tonight i thought about coming over here the the maniac from godera you know here he comes up to jesus and here it is he says even jesus says wash thy name but jesus knew the name he said my name is legion for we are many he's over here fully surrendered to the devil and got full of demons and the demons started crying out saying basically can i go down then with swine right there and he let him go down the swine they ran off into the sea and all they they all died but i tell we got to get surrendered to jesus and say i'm not just talking about quoting quoting quotes or or just say you know all the quotes or quote in the book or say hey i'm in the message i believe we say the message so many times that what is that oh i'm in the message okay what keep going let me see a life that's behind the name let me see a lot that's behind the name let me see a surrender life let me see somebody gets in the word of god and prays and reads their bible every day and truly listens to the manna that god sent the last prophet this last age that sent a prophet in this age to give us a manna tonight but let me see a life behind the name i don't yeah i'll tell you we're living in jeffersonville we've been there seven years from now and i tell you i i tell you i'm about tired of hearing and i hate this i'm not trying to be mean but all i see everybody talk to them in the message i'm in the message i'm in the message i'm in the you know what we'll see if you're in the message we'll see if the message is in you because he said in the token message the message is christ and we got to get to christ and let them clean out our life and let us get surrendered to jesus christ like my brother was saying i want to be about my father's business as jesus said that i say i want to be about my father's business every time i get up i say lord i want to be i want to do something for you what it is if it's encouraging somebody i don't care if they're on my job site and they never heard the message before i still want to encourage them because i was the same person in that chicken yard and then she handed me two tapes at night i'll never forget i was driving and i got to the barracks and i got to the bottom i probably burned the whole cd up it's about catch on fire i burned it up i went jezebel religion why their nomination i kept listening to lester and i'll tell you once i heard about baptism i couldn't get to the water quick enough that's wonderful i think somebody's getting baptized tonight that's wonderful i tell you i'll tell you if you haven't took on the name of jesus christ take it before the art door closes take the name of jesus a song take the name of jesus it's the best thing you could ever do but i started thinking about that and thinking about how blessed we are but i tell you he wants some living tabernacles tonight he wants some tabernacles that he can live in you he wants somebody that he can speak through talk to walk through you know why your kids want god with skin on it tonight they don't want you just to tell them about it they want to witness it tonight they know if you got god in your house they know if you listen to the right music they know if you're listening to these messages they know they with you every day behind closed doors your wife knows too i tell you church it's time to get a truly dedicated surrendered life and say lord maybe i've been playing in church maybe i just come because the door says come open but i tell you every time i say i think about church my brother the boy i know he's wore out but he was telling me he was crying and crying and crying ready to go home i said son but one i said one soul's worth 10 million worlds brother brown said i said i can't put never put that in my bank account i said forget all the money in the world i said forget all the money i said because one soul for jesus christ one soul but we got to be born in jesus christ and brother brown talks about in the church age books he said denominations are coming together he said by the will of man by the will of man he says in the church age books not the will of god but the will of a system but your bride tonight is gathered i'm just saying this tonight out of my own saying the bride together has gathered tonight united under jesus christ they had the will of man but we have the will of god we have the will of god tonight for a prophet to say he read that book i think it was a church ages book i think it was 12 times and then he signed it i tell you why that makes me want to just get in even more say lord i want to read it keep reading we're starting to start to open the church age books and the boys just started in sunday sunday school back at home back in church isaac's class and i tell you i was like lord help me not just these little kids but help me lily said colossians 1 16-17 for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones and dominions of principalities and powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist so what we worried about tonight while we care about tonight all things were created by him and for him tonight if they create a virus or a virus shows i don't care i just go back to the word of god and say greater is he that's in me that he that's in the world brother says i was looking this up he said he is a sovereign god he said by his own counsel he purposed the plan the plane of the salvation of his own elect which he foreknew he said the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully executes the will of the father he said he's willing he's working all things at this moment according to his purpose and his own will he said he's right in the midst of it all he is in the midst of his church he said the great creator savior god is faithful working amongst us his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep isn't that wonderful he said his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them his eye is ever upon them amen oh i should ignite you tonight he said when the word says that your lives are hid with christ in god colossians 3 he said oh i am so glad my god abides faithfully he is true to himself he won't lie he is the true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day i am glad that i'm resting in his faithfulness that's in the church age lay on seeing church age he said i'm glad i'm resting in his faithfulness are you resting in his faithfulness tonight i tell you i can't i can't live without them i can't go a day without them i can't breathe without them i need more when you get sick i tell you you really realize what you need more of you get on your back he says he gets on your back for for you to look up sometimes i tell you i back in april i got on my april may whatever it was i got on my back but i tell you it drew me closer to god as the brother was saying he got feeling baggage but but it started drawing them closer to god i tell you what the devil's trying to use for his children for the for the children of god tonight he tries to use something to come in the back door and then we just get right in front of them and say hey i'm going to turn on the tape i'm going to read the bible i'm going to start praying more i tell you you give me a sickness i'm going to get on my knees more i'm going to read the bible more i'm going to get my face in this book tonight i'm going to get more of a surrendered life to jesus and then the devil goes i don't know what to do with him brother said he only in one place he said he don't know what to do with you he only know what to do and he's like they look at that crazy one up there again he loves jesus he loves this message with all his heart all just call me an eyeball tonight but i tell you when i heard that deep call to the deep and that eagle like brother reggie was speaking of to kept throwing me out of the nest and i kept coming back grabbing me and it finally said hey why don't you set your wings why don't you set your wings oh but i'm chicken i'm picking you up tonight saying set your wings church set your wings stop living below your means and set your wings tonight start playing with the world and say lord i come with it i got a message of the hour that they were that brought me back to the word of god that showed me who i was and then he started like he said he started pulling the the feathers out aren't you thankful started pulling oh ah that hurts that hurts i heard oh that's got that tv's gotta go makeup's gotta go high heel shoes gotta go starts just plucking them out but then he starts to shape you in his image he starts shaping you in his image i'll tell you why in it wonderful i told the boys coming over here i told you we're at this conference and we're talking to these uh christian owners and and uh and we were we were just talking they were coming over here i said they said what are you all gonna be doing i said we're going to church i said the conference is over i'm excited we're going to church i said we're going to go get go meet some believers of jesus christ why aren't you thankful you've got brides all around the world that you can go to every state think about this for a minute you're going to go to every state and you can go get some manna tonight hey it might be brother brown said there might be a little seed here you got gotta spit out or whatever it is but i don't care what it is you still get some manna tonight but i'm so thankful you think about that you caught up in the nomination church they thought that was crazy we're sitting there eating breakfast i said we're going to church i said but now i'm not just talking about just a regular church i'm talking about the bride of christ i'm talking about the bride of christ that we're all going to be sitting on that wedding supper together and i started thinking about that and i said that is absolutely amazing that is absolutely amazing that you think this the church over by that baptist church over here don't even want to fellowship with the one down the road but you got the bride of christ you go down brother matthew came down to us and we were seeing him he's fellowshipping with us and it's just something about it when you get around the true believer that's surrendered to jesus christ you don't want to leave them it's like tonight i don't want to leave y'all probably going to want me to leave but i want to leave but when you get around believers i'm talking about genuine filled with the holy ghost that's dedicated to jesus and you start getting around them you say lord i don't want to go on this airplane lord can you come get us tomorrow or right now can you come between that six to nine hour i'm ready to go because i know this world has nothing to offer it has nothing to offer but filth and mess barbara said you'd have to wipe your glasses clean for your children i'm paraphrasing tonight i'll tell you church it's coming down to a time that we're living in we're getting so close and it's time to get a more sincere life and say lord if there's something tonight you just take it out lord stop by my aisle tonight and take it i love me i'm tired of playing church i'm tired just saying i'm in a message or i grew up in the message for 30 years or 20 years whatever that is but get in the message get let christ be your message let christ be it brother said he said that is the time to shake people this is the time to shake people he said this is the time that god said there become a time he says shook mount sinai he said one time but there come a shaking again he said he wouldn't only shake mount sinai but he'd shake everything that could be moved he said but did you notice the rest of the scripture he said but we received a kingdom that cannot be moved aren't you thankful tonight that we receive the kingdom that can be moved that nothing can be taken from you your car can be taken your brother said even his recliner was taken he didn't care because he was ahead of surrender life but you know what we can have a surrender life it's not just for brother bryan it's for every one of us it's for everyone he wants to live in a person tonight living living the bride tonight to manifest itself he says but did you notice the rest of scripture but we receive a kingdom that can't be moved hallelujah everything can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the earth will shake heavens and earth will pass away but the word shall never pass away he said for upon this rock i'll build my church in the gates of hell will never prevail against it everything that can be shook will be shaken but we receive a kingdom which is the word of god himself and god is his word he said he don't shake himself amen oh my but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved it's unshakable said paul in hebrew it's unshakable tonight aren't you thankful that you're that i'm re there's a psalm of life sings i'm resting in the arms of of a merciful savior we are resting in the arms of the jehovah gyra if you ever go to your seventh page in your bible and read all the redemption names oh well they'll

you that's wherever i go every time people get tired of it well chris what do you think i said well the bible says i'm not going to tell you what i think i'm going to tell you what the bible says i'll tell you he'll bless you abundantly he'll he'll overflow your house i'll tell you my wife was working full-time and she'll tell you this testimony we moved from in the uh south carolina indiana about seven years ago she was working full-time we were upside down and i'm not telling you not to work or whatever lord tells you to do but in our family she was trying to work and i was working i said one day she came home had a career for 15 years before we met and i said we've been married i think this will be our 14th year and i better get that right and and so so i think it was 2007 we got married and hey she come home and she said what are you doing i said we're selling the house you're quitting your job i said we're getting rid of all of it i said we're getting rid of this house that's on the lake we're doing it all wrong we got all these material things and we just had i think isaac or joseph and i said we're doing it all wrong i'm just admitting to you tonight i said we're doing it all wrong god come down and just refilled me and i said we're giving it all the way that mess is nothing we got kids to raise now we got a family to bring up in a message that we are blessed with and so i sold it all sold the house sold everything you asked her sold the boat i almost i tell you she probably thought she was next i sold everything i kept going down the line i know she started getting worried and all of a sudden we're selling the bolts tell everything we got rid of it i'm not telling you to do this i'm just telling you if god tells you to do it so i can start getting a surrendered life i'm just telling you a fully surrendered life i started listening to what god said i started praying more i started getting on my not just a one uh just a one minute prayer but starting to get serious with god and god said hey for you you're gonna give it all up i said oh jesus so i started doing that i started giving up she came home she was shaking to death i'm just gonna give you a little testimony we'll close here in a second i just want to give you a little testimony about a surrendered life god started working in my life and i was like oh i've been around the message for three what i don't know how many years it was maybe seven years by then or six years and i said you know well and she come home she was shaking she came home faithfully and she come home and she started putting her notice in they said well we want you to be the chief of the hospital we don't want you to just be the she was a pharmacist uh 15 years she hadn't been a pharmacist in what eight years ten years seven years whatever it is and so we left it all up flustered all the commode and god has blessed us every time he has provided every meal he's provided everything we need he's gave us more he's blessed us even more and we got a full surrender she put her notice in she was typing in her thing and her her manager calls her said rachel we want you to take it we actually want to move you and take take over the whole whole division she said no i'm actually going to put my notice in they're like what you're putting your nose in yeah well we i tell you but we got i started the head of the house gotta fully surrender life he started to realize what his matters were and said god i need you more and god come down and just fully surrendered me and i started going well whatever it is i put resumes in tennessee all over the place i said you know what next we got to find a church whatever it was and we just kept putting resume finally i tell you they don't do this in insurance because i was doing the insurance at the time they called me this is how god works i tell you we need to step up by faith i'm tired we have such little faith today oh ye of little faith like jesus says i believe we need to take a big step out in our lives and the way we are we need to step out by faith and say god i don't see what's going on but i'm going to lead by what you whatever you say in your word you said you'll take care of me so i'm just trying to get down your eye and we'll close and we i just she put her notice in and all of a sudden here she is she puts her notice in she comes back we put an application all over the place place in indiana called me back said hey not only are we going to uh pay the closing costs we're gonna move you too i looked at my wife i said are you kidding me i said this insurance company is gonna pay a bill to move us they came and packed every box and i was sitting there rejoicing and i was praising god i said god you are a merciful savior and i will praise you i will be a more surrendered life more than i've ever had and i'll tell you church he's a real god he's not just a god and praise him but he's a god he he's god in the valley he's god on the mountain whatever you need tonight he's god and i'll tell you i was sitting there and i was praising god and they were boxing every box she didn't have to touch one box she was like i gotta pack all this whole house up and i said no honey you can actually watch them you can watch them put the names on it you can actually tell them just how that's my dishes please but you know what god cares god cares about his children tonight but that's what god wants to live inside of us tonight that if we get fully surrendered and i'm just telling you a personal testimony of myself that when you truly surrender to jesus christ i don't care what age it is or what how old you are whatever is but a surrendered life will move mountains jesus will do all the moving for you when you start to realize hey god i'm trying to do the moving when god wants to do it for you tonight god wants to move something in your life there's something that's come through this church tonight that he wants to do something in your life i don't know any of my notes i'm just telling you tonight god wants to do something for you god wants to move something out of your life that you put before god i don't know what it is games whatever it is of this world he wants to do something for you i don't know i i'm just telling you tonight that god wants to move you tonight he wants to he wants to move that out of your life and you he'll become fully surrendered not just saying i'm living this message or i believe malachi 4. the devil believes brother brown he knows the quotes he knows he's a prophet he knows it all but he wants to see a life he said i can see he said when the weakest christian gets to his knees the devil trembles the weakest christian could you imagine a fully surrendered life that's praying day and night and reading the word of god and keeping their face in the book could you imagine when you get on your knees what it does to the devil they don't just make them tremble i can't imagine but i'm just here tonight and god bless you but i'm just here to tell you tonight a fully surrendered cry for jesus a dedicated life and i just admitted to you tonight that was set that was over eight years ago that we were doing it completely wrong i was listening to the tapes i was hearing the mess i really wasn't even hearing it i just pushed play we were listening sometimes in our house and it really just was background noise i'm here to tell you tonight it's real that i was pushing play and well i'm listening to the prophet i'm okay no it's about getting truly with god saying god you feel my vessel you come down and you take all the trash out and y'all want to be crystal clear i want to live for this word i will live for this message my whole life but i call the message christ because brother branham said the message is christ i want to live for the one that died on the cross that rose again in three days that had the keys to death hell and the grave that when we pass away it's just stepping into without theophany how glorious will it be i don't like playing flights we were flying the plane the boys were like well you know dad well you know if we crash we just we just crash we die anyway you know i said praise god praise god if we go down we just we just step on over like that song says we'll they'll we'll speed up they'll slow down i'm looking for that city i see it coming down church i believe it's so plain view right now i believe it's coming in plain view the bride his brother brown said he said one place and close it he said one place he said he said the bride he said it has everything she has need of right now he says this brother brown says she has everything she has need of to get out of here he's just waiting for one of us to catch up i don't know if it's one of you tonight i don't know what it is but we gotta get about the father's business and step out by faith and you just believe it's more than just saying i know a quote but to truly get down and listen and say lord what are you saying to me in this tape what are you saying to me in the word of god change me take it all out of me and i believe that's what god wants us to do as brother reggie was saying he was speaking already kind of a little bit on the lines of talking about his testimony and how an eagle just coming down soaring down and you know just changing his life and how he grew up in the message it blessed my heart grew up in the message and heard all the tapes and judging this and judging that but one day he got an experience that's where it's at it's a truly experience and a true experience with god will change you the rest of your life it'll take whatever you had of the world out it'll take the desires out to taste out everything take it all out he'll take it that's our god as we close tonight i'm gonna read this last one and we're gonna close that maybe the musicians come i want to read this last quote it says now if god did not spare his son from this cruel testing then he will not spare you or i from this cruel testing he said in jesus he said was here confronting the greatest test that he and this is where i was reading from not my will but that will be done he says in jesus i looked this up he said jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he ever had gethsemane laid just before him where that once and final all sufficient tests must come he said when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder he said there was no one in all of heaven's or earth could ever stood in it but him he said and to know thank you and to know that all of the sins and past sins and present sins and future sins rested upon his decision think about that tonight just think on that in closing he said and it was one of the most greatest victories that christ ever won he said or proved his great messiahship he says as when he said to god not my will thine be done he said that was the greatest victory that he'd ever won he said all of the demons of torment was around to tempt him and try him but he said not my will but thing be done as they play something softly tonight thing i want you to think just for a few minutes i know they're fixing to change this order of the service to the baptismal praise god someone taking on the name of jesus what better thing can you do but take on jesus name get rid of your last name and say lord i want your name what better thing to do tonight is just to stop and see someone else go to a watery grave come up and get the name of jesus christ and get more of a surrender life to jesus i think we all can can have can all grow closer to jesus as the days are approaching we see evil in every corner everything's changing this and that the throughout everything is changing but one thing god has got a people just fixing to get out of here and he's waiting for the bride to make herself ready he's wanting you to get closer to him wants you to love him more wants you to read his love language this is a love book tonight this is a love book not just a book of rules or a book of laws but it's a love book tonight it's a book that i want to read every day and say lord change me life let me have a more surrendered life to you lord not just something that i pick up i'll tell you brother brown picked up a book i'll never forget i heard this down in indiana brother it was brother billy paul he said he took a book and brother brought it over or some book and jesus said get that book away from the bible it was some just it was just a book that someone wrote about it was a god supposedly a godly man and it really wasn't and you just put it near the bible and he said get it away from the bible then he takes the church of his book reads it 12 times or he's told me 12 times and then signs it i tell you church it's time to get our face in a book that will change you we can spend hours upon hours flipping through social media i'm here to tell you tonight we can flip hours and hours of scrolling i'm scrolling i'm serious church we can scroll and scroll and scroll and then the kids watch us our own kids are watching then they look at mommy and daddy or whatever it is and they're scrolling and i'm just i'm just being real tonight and all they see is us on us so then then they start doing it because mommy and daddy approve it even though i'm all in life everybody's like whatever's life tonight i'm just telling you but why can't we scroll down the will the the the main thing that says heavens and earth will not pass away he said but my word will not pass we need to pick up the book and start scrolling in our lives and say lord draw me near lord draw me near draw me to a fountain that will change my family it will change my marriage that would change my kids that would chan i don't care my boy said hey i got to get caught up with schoolwork i said he started crying he said i need to get i said forget the school work just isaac i told him on the back i said forget schoolwork i said let's go see about being with father's business forget the schoolwork and plus i don't care if you can add or plus their minds paul they couldn't barely write their name i just want you to get filled with the holy ghost i want your about life to be filled with the holy ghost forget the schoolwork hey i'm not trying to tell you not to raise your kids up in the school and plus learn how to you gotta they gotta make a living one day but i'm telling you i want to be about my father's business first and foremost and i every day say lord i want to be a better christian than i was yesterday and i don't want to live a life in a rear-view mirror i want to use it as a reference when i'm driving down the road and say oh my gosh lord i used to be there but now i'm not i used to be there but now i'm not when you start looking through the windshield tonight and of our of our life and say lord i want more of you with all heads bowed all eyes closed that head's about tonight i don't know i just felt led to speak on not my will but i can be done tonight i'm more of a surrendered life to jesus about his business not ours maybe there was one that could say lord i i need a more dedicated life i want another re-baptism tonight whatever it is tonight i'm not the lord sees he's the one that sees tonight hands up everywhere lord we come to you lord we come to you my hands up lord god we just love you lord we thank you that you've brought the the word in this hour lord that we could just be doers of your word not just hearers lord god i ask you every hand that's in this place lord may you come down their aisle may they whatever it is tonight my life may you shape us in the form of your image that's what you came here for to fill a vessel for we could walk and be a living testimony for you god may you touch us tonight may you may you strengthen us may you bless this church lord bless brother david and pick him up lord i know he said he's been down and out maybe touch his body may you take away the sickness or the aches or whatever it is everything that's going around lord it might be a real virus but we have a real god tonight that you said you're making intercessions upon our confession god we believe that tonight we believe that you're looking down from glory saying i'll touch you i'll fill you i'll take that desire out of your life oh father fill us tonight we love you father oh father what song is that i give myself away [Music] i give myself away [Music] me [Music] think about it tonight [Music] i give myself away [Music] i give myself away whole church he wants to use you tonight always want a vessel tonight that he can use oh think about it [Music] god bless you [Music] uh [Music] you really do that tonight i give myself away [Music] let's stand together and sing this song myself away [Music] give myself away so you can use me my life is my life is not my own to you i belong [Music] amen tonight brother joseph would you go take your son to get ready for baptism [Music] you know there's a a great reason [Music] for reading this book and it goes beyond doctrine and right because in this book you read about men and you read about women and you read about circumstances and situations you read about a man that had a prodigal son right right you read about a husband and wife who had a demon-possessed boy and can you read those stories and what you see all through this scripture is the supernatural you have a testimony of a god that works supernaturally and [Music] when you can sit back and you can see that is god and that's what god does and then you can start to say that's what i want in my life i want the supernatural in my life what he's done in this book i can see in my life because he's the same yesterday today and tomorrow it's brother true says you know isn't it man's always looking back at what god's done he's always looking forward to what he thinks that god might do but he never realizes that he's there to do the supernatural for you right now and when young people when we talk about inviting god into your life we're not talking about providing you some new rules to live by that's right or just getting all the music we don't like out of your life but we're talking about you you coming in contact with something that's supernatural and that can do things for you they can be real and and and i i just believe that i i really enjoyed that tonight it meant a lot to me because of course you know it probably meant a lot to you because of wednesday night and of what we preached and they just like a little confirmation of the lord coming standing right behind that that it it's so on the right track that that supernatural god is what's working in our midst what's

whatever you want to do okay amen you love the lord tonight you know i i wondered quite a bit about baptizing children and and that you know i thought quite about it and then i came up upon a statement where the prophet of god talked about children being baptized and it really moved me and and i also thought about it a long time is you never ever keep somebody from doing the right thing you know what i mean and i've baptized people over again that have been baptized i've had people come to me that wanted to re be re-baptized but really what they needed to do was be rededicated so we never know all the circumstances behind everything but i just know that this young man wanted to be baptized and it's a right thing to do and it's what we teach to do um and i know he's sincere in what he's doing and he told me he says well i'm gonna have to start being nicer to my brother so that's good enough for me amen so we really appreciate it tonight so let's look at turning our bodies you're welcome to be seated you're welcome to stay standing whatever is most comfortable for you this evening as we uh look in our bibles and we turn into the book of acts and we know that at that time of the passover that the disciples had been in the upper room and they were waiting there until they were well what they were waiting for they were waiting for the return of jesus christ to them that's what they were waiting for because he promised that i'll be with you even in you till the end i will not leave you comfortless but i personal pronoun will come again and i will be with you even in you so they were there waiting for his return and they were waiting there and he came and he manifested himself in the form of the pillars of fire all in that room because that's the way he was going to be in the church from then on and so they they were there and they received this great presence of the lord and because that was the thing that was to be so he came out and they said these men are drunk he says no this is what was prophesied i'll pour out my spirit upon my sons and daughters they shall dream dreams they shall see vision this is it this is that yeah right amen and and this is the life that we want to bring we we're moving past the doctrine of the message to a life that possesses the doctrine but also has the power if there's ever a time that the power and the doctrine are becoming one that produces the full life of christ so we're happy to baptize our brother and it says here and he says and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do now peter's got the commission doesn't he he knows exactly what to do do the word of god right and then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this upwards generation and they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day were added unto them about 3 000 souls amen he's still calling he's still filling and we're still baptized amen praise the lord amen amen my little friend you have chosen in your heart to fulfill the word of god and to be baptized and we carry out the commission to go into all the world and baptize them in the name one name of father son and holy ghost and by divine revelation and a clear evidence in the scripture we know that that name is the lord jesus christ therefore according to the word of god we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] it's amen lord richly bless you worship the lord dismiss tonight amen what a testimony we're going to invite brother moses to come at this time and sing this the special that he always
