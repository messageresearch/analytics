[29:35] tonight and just to say what the prophet
[29:38] has already said amen and I just want to
[29:40] thank the pastor for allowing me the
[29:43] privilege tonight to say something to
[29:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ and also I
[29:48] want to thank the Believers this is my
[29:51] last service tonight tomorrow by the the
[29:55] Lord willing I'll be going back to Cape
[29:57] Town again
[29:58] but I have great memories of my stay
[30:01] I've been here five weeks now with the
[30:03] Saints of like Precious faith and I've
[30:06] enjoyed your
[30:07] fellowship and also you're very you're
[30:10] nice people I enjoyed the worship you
[30:14] know it's a wonderful spirit that
[30:16] prevails in this church and I believe
[30:19] that God is doing something beautiful
[30:22] wonderful here in this Christian
[30:25] fellowship and I to thank each and every
[30:28] family every brother that invited me to
[30:30] their home have some fellowship and time
[30:34] to enjoy the food of Dallas amen thank
[30:39] you for that and I don't want to mention
[30:41] by name but the Brethren all know who
[30:44] they are and I'm going to say thank you
[30:46] for your invitation May Godly bless you
[30:50] and be with you and I believe that I
[30:53] will long
[30:54] remember the experience and the
[30:56] fellowship that I had here even our
[30:59] fellowship on the Friday morning amen
[31:01] I've been to all the Bible studies and
[31:05] and truly I enjoyed the fellowship with
[31:07] the Believers there we could just feel
[31:09] the presence of the Lord was with us and
[31:12] tonight as we come to the last service I
[31:15] believe that God has got something for
[31:17] us you know whenever I come to the
[31:20] service I sit in the
[31:21] congregation I look at that Dove you
[31:24] know it's a very prominent figure in the
[31:27] church
[31:28] so I thought maybe I would like to speak
[31:30] on the dove so when you enter here and
[31:33] you look at the dove you know I spoke
[31:36] first on the face of God when you come
[31:37] into the church you see the face of God
[31:41] but now you come into the sanctuary
[31:43] there's a dove offering
[31:45] over those who go through baptism they
[31:49] repent and they are baptized in the name
[31:51] of Jesus Christ the next phase is for
[31:53] the dove to come and find its roosting
[31:57] place in their heart so we have there
[32:00] right before you that the dove his
[32:03] presence may be felt in our midst so
[32:06] tonight while we are standing before I
[32:08] read the word shall we just have a word
[32:10] of
[32:11] prayer our heavenly father we are so
[32:13] thankful tonight that once again we
[32:16] could be gathered in your
[32:18] presence Lord we could have been in so
[32:20] many places
[32:21] tonight but father we just felt the tug
[32:24] of the Holy Spirit to come to the house
[32:26] of the Lord once again oh God to feel
[32:29] you in our midst Lord to know that you
[32:32] are the only true and living God Jesus
[32:35] Christ the same yesterday today and
[32:38] forever and tonight we pray father may
[32:41] you come and break the bread of life
[32:44] father God we are a needy people as our
[32:47] faces differ so does our needs differ
[32:49] tonight may you come in your own special
[32:52] way and speak to every heart Lord we
[32:55] want to make our confession tonight that
[32:58] we love you and we appreciate you Lord
[33:00] we thank you for this great Plan of
[33:03] Redemption that Lord it was you at the
[33:05] beginning it's you at the end you are
[33:08] the author and the finisher of our faith
[33:11] and therefore tonight we come to give
[33:13] you glory we give you honor and all the
[33:15] praise for what you have done for us may
[33:17] you bless the reading of your word as we
[33:20] ask it in Jesus name amen amen let us
[33:24] turn to our Bibles for a scripture
[33:25] reading to the Book of Exodus CH 12 and
[33:29] verse 13 and also Hebrews
[33:33] 11:
[33:35] 13-6 and then we'll read from verses 37
[33:38] to
[33:40] 40 we'll started by reading Exodus 12
[33:44] and verse
[33:49] 13 and the blood shall be to you for a
[33:52] token upon the houses where ye are and
[33:57] when I see the blood I will pass over
[34:00] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[34:03] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[34:07] Egypt and then we turn to Hebrews chap
[34:11] 11: 13-
[34:17] 16 read us these all died in faith not
[34:23] having received the promises but having
[34:26] seen them a far
[34:29] off see it was quite distant with this
[34:32] great fulfillment of the promise when
[34:34] the Messiah would come but they saw it a
[34:37] far off and listen what they were
[34:40] willing to do knowing that this was a
[34:43] reality to them as you he this morning
[34:46] that this word has got to become
[34:49] reality it is you that the prophet is
[34:52] speaking about
[34:54] amen but having seen them a far off
[34:58] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[35:01] them and confessed that they were
[35:04] strangers and pilgrims on the earth for
[35:08] they that say such things declare
[35:11] plainly that they seek a country and
[35:14] truly if they had been mindful of that
[35:17] country from whence they came out they
[35:20] might have had opportunity to have
[35:23] returned but now they desire a better
[35:26] country that is and
[35:28] Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to
[35:32] be called their God for he hath prepared
[35:36] for them a city
[35:39] amen
[35:43] hallelujah amen
[35:45] so where am I
[35:47] now so let's turn read further on number
[35:52] uh verse number
[35:53] 37 they were stoned they were sown a son
[35:58] were tempted were slain with sword they
[36:02] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[36:05] skins being destitute Afflicted
[36:09] tormented of whom the world was not
[36:12] worthy they wandered in the deserts and
[36:15] in the mountains and in dens and in the
[36:17] caves of the earth and all these having
[36:21] obtained a good report through faith
[36:24] received not the promise
[36:28] God having provided some better thing
[36:30] for us that they without us should not
[36:35] be made perfect may the Lord add His
[36:38] blessings reading of his word you may be
[36:40] seated so tonight as a subject like to
[36:45] speak without us they are not
[36:49] perfect and then I would like to focus
[36:52] on the
[36:53] dove specifically the seventh dove
[36:59] as we all understand that
[37:01] Redemption is about
[37:03] blood it starts off with defiled blood
[37:06] causing the fall of
[37:08] Man and the undefiled blood of God to
[37:12] redeem man back to the place where he
[37:14] fell from now when God made the first
[37:18] Adam he made Adam a
[37:21] son Adam was an offspring he was fresh
[37:25] from the hand of God
[37:28] and Adam we find listen to his wife and
[37:32] his wife listened to the serpent instead
[37:36] of a husband and we find that they were
[37:38] both corrupted and they brought
[37:41] pollution upon the Earth by the
[37:44] defilement of the
[37:46] bloodstream they brought sin upon
[37:50] themselves they actually fell from a
[37:53] condition of
[37:55] perfection into a condition where they
[37:57] were subject to sin all kinds of
[38:01] sickness Came Upon them whatever we
[38:03] mention from the pulpit whatever desire
[38:05] was because of the unbelief of Adam and
[38:09] Eve in the Garden of
[38:11] Eden and we find therefore the whole
[38:13] human race was born in sin shaped in
[38:16] iniquity it comes to the world speaking
[38:18] lies because of Adam's condition and we
[38:22] find there was really no way out the
[38:26] holy image of God God left them in the
[38:29] Garden of Eden now just to get a little
[38:33] background about the Holy image of God
[38:36] I'd like to read a quotation here in the
[38:37] message Oneness brother brandham said
[38:40] now the first man and woman in the
[38:43] Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[38:47] with God now whatever God determined in
[38:51] Eden before the fall that was God's
[38:55] Eternal
[38:56] thought God cannot improve on what he
[38:59] does his first thought is perfect so if
[39:04] God required
[39:06] harmony with man and his wife and with
[39:10] god brother brah says there were in so
[39:13] much Harmony so much that God could come
[39:16] down at any time he desired to speak lip
[39:20] to ear to
[39:22] them that is the type of relationship
[39:24] with God desires of man before the Fall
[39:28] In the Garden of Eden now that is
[39:32] perfect
[39:33] Oneness God and His
[39:36] creation God speaking lip to ear with
[39:40] Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in
[39:44] harmony with God till they were one with
[39:50] God God and his family was
[39:55] one they were God's examples to
[39:59] us that is what God's original intention
[40:03] was that perfect fellowship with man
[40:07] what we should be to them ever present
[40:12] never
[40:13] failing when they spoke God answered he
[40:18] watched them daily night when they lay
[40:22] down to sleep he watched over them in
[40:25] the daytime he guided them he fed them
[40:29] loved them communed with them constantly
[40:33] all the
[40:34] time so it wasn't just a a communion on
[40:38] a Sunday morning and maybe a Sunday
[40:39] evening and and again on a Prayer
[40:42] evening on a Wednesday night but it was
[40:44] a constant
[40:46] communion that's God's fellowship with
[40:49] man
[40:51] see they were in God's image amen now
[40:56] how they were they in God's image
[40:57] brother brandham says and God was in
[41:01] them that Dove the Holy Ghost was in
[41:05] them see that's what makes a
[41:09] fellowship that's what makes the union
[41:12] is God in his
[41:16] church that's the union he said much
[41:19] more could be said see United with him
[41:22] is eternal life and only one way we can
[41:26] Unite with him is to come every bit of
[41:30] his
[41:31] word take every promise and believe it
[41:36] see now listen now when Adam and Eve
[41:39] listen to the LIE of the devil you heard
[41:42] this morning about
[41:45] lies amen but if we accept the word that
[41:49] is what we got to live by not by bread
[41:51] alone by every word that proceeds from
[41:54] the mouth of God see
[41:58] Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the
[42:00] devil the holy image of god let's say
[42:04] the dove left them their Fellowship was
[42:09] broken with God their Fellowship of
[42:12] Oneness with God was
[42:16] broken the very minute they listened to
[42:18] the LIE of the devil that broke their
[42:23] fellowship and the very minute you
[42:26] listen to the L of the devil it'll break
[42:29] your
[42:32] fellowship that's the very minute that
[42:34] you go out from the presence of God is
[42:38] when you listen to the LIE of the devil
[42:41] so let's stay with the word stay with
[42:43] the message that you have heard amen
[42:47] that's the way we stay in the presence
[42:49] of God not jumping and shouting whatever
[42:52] those are things that can happen if you
[42:54] are full of the joy of the Lord could
[42:56] happen but doesn't say You must have
[42:58] that in
[42:59] order as as a sign that you've got the
[43:02] Holy Ghost amen see that's the very
[43:06] minute you go out from the presence of
[43:08] God like she did is when you fail to
[43:11] take God's word just as it is so we find
[43:17] that man was in a sinful
[43:20] condition when the dove the holy spirit
[43:22] of God left in the Garden of Eden
[43:27] what did it bring
[43:29] suffering it brought sickness it brought
[43:32] death it brought jealousy it brought
[43:36] murder Cain slew his brother
[43:39] Abel sorrow Came Upon man so God had to
[43:44] make a way that the holy image of God
[43:48] could come back to man
[43:51] again that the dove could come back to
[43:54] man again so that he could bring it back
[43:58] to Eden
[44:00] again now Eden was the home of the
[44:06] dove and brother brandham says that the
[44:09] dove is a home loving
[44:12] bird and God reflects his
[44:17] nature amen through a Heavenly creature
[44:22] and that was the
[44:24] Dove and he reflected that nature so
[44:27] much that the dove is a home loving
[44:31] creature let's just listen what he says
[44:33] on the wings of a snow white dove I
[44:35] believe that this is a prophetic
[44:37] message
[44:40] amen and by his home loving
[44:44] conduct by the conduct of its home
[44:46] loving it has been successfully used for
[44:50] a carry a
[44:52] pigeon because it loves home
[44:57] so if this Dove loved
[45:00] home then it must go back to Eden again
[45:04] and that is a whole Plan of Redemption
[45:07] is to bring everything back home
[45:11] again the prophet says God had a
[45:13] threefold purpose that was to reveal
[45:16] himself secondly to have preeminence and
[45:20] thirdly to restore everything back to
[45:22] Eden again Eden is the home of the dove
[45:27] it's a home loving
[45:30] creature says because it loves home you
[45:33] turn it loose anywhere it'll always go
[45:37] back
[45:38] home that's why even a believer amen we
[45:41] are born in Sun shaped iniquity we come
[45:43] to the world speaking lies but there's a
[45:45] nature in us there's a part of God
[45:49] within us that when the light of God
[45:51] shines upon us like the woman at the
[45:53] well she was a prostitute and who would
[45:56] get any hope for a woman that's a
[45:59] prostitute and there Jesus was sitting
[46:01] at the well he was waiting for her
[46:05] Emanuel God in human flesh and she came
[46:09] by the Water by the well it looked like
[46:11] he was you know interfering with her
[46:14] trying to get her attention he says give
[46:17] me a drink of water he says if you know
[46:19] who I am you wouldn't ask me but he said
[46:21] but if you know who was speaking to you
[46:23] and then brother brah says he contacted
[46:25] her spirit he said he says go fetch me
[46:27] your husband he says I have none he says
[46:30] you spoken right he says because Bible
[46:34] says when the Messiah cometh he'll show
[46:36] us these things and he said I am he and
[46:40] that very moment she dropped the water
[46:42] PT see God closed the book of life and
[46:47] he now opened the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:50] she could never be a prostitute again
[46:53] cuz now she manifested that original
[46:56] germ that was in her waiting to be
[46:59] manifested when the word Shone upon that
[47:02] seed amen and that's what happened to
[47:04] all of us here amen we were out in the
[47:07] world we were a different denomination
[47:09] but the day that the message was
[47:11] revealed to us amen we left the book of
[47:14] life and we came amen the L's Book of
[47:17] Life was open unto us who we really are
[47:20] Who I Am Lord who I am amen I'm a part
[47:24] of God I'm a part of his creation I'm an
[47:26] attribute of God expressed we could
[47:28] never use that language before until the
[47:31] time when that seed of life the gene of
[47:34] God became quickened and we became alive
[47:37] and then we realize that I'm a Son of
[47:39] God I'm no longer a son of Charles and
[47:40] El Bram I am a Son of God Amen I'm here
[47:45] to manifest the purpose of God isn't he
[47:49] wonderful
[47:52] amen it loves its way home so no matter
[47:56] where where you were how deep you were
[47:58] in sin you had to find your way home and
[48:01] this is home to you this is where you
[48:04] belong this is heaven to you this is the
[48:07] atmosphere that you enjoy amen it will
[48:10] go back
[48:11] home now Eden being a place of heavenly
[48:16] peace on
[48:18] Earth it was a place of eternal
[48:22] life and the dove is a symbol of life
[48:27] a place where God comes to roost and
[48:30] fellowship with his family amen he comes
[48:34] in Roots he Roots within your heart if
[48:37] you abide me and my word in you then you
[48:40] ask what you will amen that D has come
[48:43] to has got to come and live within you
[48:45] he's got to come and abide with you aen
[48:49] but it couldn't happen until first
[48:51] Emmanuel Came Upon the scene and he said
[48:54] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[48:57] pleased to dwell amen and he came to
[48:59] indwell that body the Dove and he went
[49:02] to Calvary to pay and to cleanse
[49:05] sanctify your church and on the day of
[49:08] Pentecost that same Dove came and that
[49:10] Pillar of Fire came and divided itself
[49:13] up and that was the faith and that Faith
[49:16] started in the River
[49:18] Jordan amen it's actually started in the
[49:21] Book of Genesis because God said I'll be
[49:24] a god unto you and to your seed
[49:27] Amen in their generation brother BR says
[49:29] the faith of God wasn't as much
[49:31] referring to Isaac but to Jesus where
[49:35] the Flesh and spirit would be United
[49:38] together amen and then he went to
[49:41] Calvary Sanctified the church so that
[49:43] the dove the Holy Ghost the pillar of
[49:46] fire could come and indwell that first
[49:49] church amen and lick of fire was upon
[49:52] each and every believer god uniting with
[49:56] man amen what was his purpose take it
[49:58] all back to Eden again Hallelujah the
[50:02] home of the dove the prophet says we'd
[50:05] like to stress on that a little while
[50:08] and you Christians would understand what
[50:09] I mean it always finds its way back home
[50:14] so therefore it's been used as a carrier
[50:17] pigeon it's used in a time of War used
[50:21] to be they Soul use them carrier pigeons
[50:25] to carry a message
[50:27] so you see then that makes the dove both
[50:30] by God and man a
[50:33] messenger a dove is a messenger it was a
[50:37] messenger to Noah to tell Noah that
[50:40] there's peace again on
[50:43] Earth God poured out his judgment in the
[50:45] days of Noah but then he sent a sign on
[50:49] the wings of a dove that peace has been
[50:51] restored again amen what was it was that
[50:55] peace of Eden when the dove comes it's a
[50:58] sign of God hallelujah it was a message
[51:03] to Noah it was used by God to vindicate
[51:06] that this was his son the sacrifice to
[51:11] bring peace upon Earth and Good Will to
[51:15] men it was used as a
[51:19] messenger amen I won't go any further
[51:22] then I'll be giving out the end of my
[51:24] sermon amen hallelujah so while the
[51:27] prophet's grandmother was
[51:30] dying brother brandham says she were
[51:32] singing Rock of Ages cleff for me let me
[51:36] hide myself in thee he says her feeble
[51:41] hands up in the air a dove flew in the
[51:45] door come around sat down at the top of
[51:48] the bed started coing and God took a
[51:53] soul amen so we know exactly where that
[51:55] Soul must have gone to
[51:57] because the DB itself came to collect
[51:59] that soul and while praying for his the
[52:02] great granddaughter of Florence nting
[52:05] girl the prophet says I knelt down with
[52:08] your pastor on the room to pray and when
[52:12] I nailed down to pray a little Dove flew
[52:14] up by the window begin cooing when I
[52:18] finished praying I thought it was a pet
[52:20] duve there somewhere foggy outside How
[52:24] England is the British a there say and
[52:27] this little Dove quit cing and flew away
[52:31] I walked over and laid hands upon her
[52:34] and call the name of the Lord and the
[52:36] woman is a great big strong healthy
[52:40] woman today on the wings of a dove was a
[52:45] sign of a healing amen so we find that
[52:49] the serpent introduce the
[52:52] defilement of an undefiled Holy Blood
[52:56] stream of man whom God had
[53:00] created and the requirement was
[53:03] undefiled blood of an innocent
[53:07] substitute to reverse the process of
[53:11] death which was introduced by the
[53:15] serpent as we all know that life is in
[53:18] the blood and the blood is different
[53:21] from the life see the blood is the
[53:25] chemistry
[53:27] of the life so you have the blood but in
[53:29] the blood you find the blood Caples the
[53:32] life and we find when the when the life
[53:36] went out of the sacrifice the blood the
[53:39] life of the animal could not come back
[53:41] upon the worshipper he had to apply the
[53:45] chemistry amen and throughout the Old
[53:48] Testament they had to apply the
[53:51] chemistry see because animal life does
[53:55] not have a Soul so the life in the
[53:58] animal could not come back upon the
[54:01] worshipper it's a living being but it's
[54:03] not a living Soul so we find to redeem
[54:07] Fallen man the father himself had become
[54:12] one of
[54:13] us see Emmanuel and that was the real
[54:18] Lamb with the real life amen the prophet
[54:24] says in the message the token par
[54:27] 118 that's the reason the
[54:30] lamb which is God's Earthly
[54:34] representative was so identified in the
[54:37] Garden of
[54:38] Eden knowing that the lamb and the
[54:42] dove being God's Heavenly
[54:46] representative so here God the dove
[54:50] presented Adam and Eve with the
[54:53] lamb and the prophet says
[54:58] knowing that the lamb and the dove would
[55:00] meet one time when the lamb and the dove
[55:04] would be together so God was already
[55:08] prophesying in the Garden of Eden the
[55:10] day will come when the dove will settle
[55:14] upon the lamb
[55:16] again Hallelujah that would be the
[55:18] second Adam left the first Adam the
[55:22] image of God left them but there would
[55:24] come a time when the dove and you think
[55:26] when the dove comes it reverses
[55:29] everything amen instead of death there's
[55:31] now Resurrection the Bible says he was
[55:34] wounded for our transgression he was
[55:37] bruised for our iniquity he reversed
[55:39] everything which the devil put in Motion
[55:41] in Eden he made a way for our healing by
[55:45] his stripes we are healed Hallelujah
[55:49] shows the significance of the dove there
[55:52] we find the lamb and the dove together
[55:56] again so we find that God identified
[56:00] himself as the dove which is the most
[56:03] innocent and cleanest of all the
[56:06] Heavenly
[56:07] Creatures Amen in bird life Prophet says
[56:11] he always spoke about the dove as being
[56:14] a symbol of
[56:16] God and the crow as a symbol of a
[56:20] hypocrite amen you can eat dve food you
[56:22] can also eat the things of the world
[56:25] carrying he says you're on the wings of
[56:27] a
[56:28] dove so I found out that a dove don't
[56:31] have any
[56:34] G there's no gold in a dove because he
[56:37] has no need of
[56:39] it so that's the way it is with a
[56:42] Christian he doesn't need any
[56:46] bitterness see cuz he can only eat the
[56:51] food of God see so there's no Christian
[56:55] that's bitter
[56:57] because a dove does not behave itself in
[56:59] one person and misbehave itself in
[57:02] another person it's a national spirit
[57:05] and it brings the same result when the
[57:08] dove comes and settle in your heart he
[57:11] says he doesn't need any bitterness here
[57:13] because he can only eat the food of God
[57:16] and it doesn't take bitterness to
[57:18] dissolve that it takes love to dissolve
[57:21] the food bitterness oh they say well
[57:24] they don't they they difference with it
[57:27] but love always receives it the word of
[57:33] God now he has no goal so therefore it's
[57:38] just against him to eat anything
[57:43] bad the nature of the love which nature
[57:47] now comes on the believer a
[57:49] Christian see and if he would it would
[57:53] kill him but there's no danger he isn't
[57:56] going to eat it because he has no
[58:00] appetite for it it's against your nature
[58:03] to do that why because of the
[58:07] dve and that's the way it is with a real
[58:10] Christian did you know a real Christian
[58:13] doesn't even have any sin at all imputed
[58:15] to
[58:17] him David said blessed is the man whom
[58:21] God will not impute sin to when you are
[58:24] washed in the blood of the Lamb
[58:26] not by make belief but really the blood
[58:32] of the
[58:33] Lamb God does not impute sin to you
[58:36] anything that's done because you're
[58:39] under the blood and he doesn't see it
[58:44] amen we don't say believe the devil's
[58:46] Lies We only believe the word of God we
[58:51] only digest the word of God we have got
[58:54] no time for little stories you know
[58:56] things go
[58:57] around amen say what's the latest news
[58:59] or what's the latest Story the gossip
[59:01] story whatever the dove does not digest
[59:04] that amen he lives on the pure holy word
[59:08] of God see he saw you the the blood
[59:12] sacrifice the only thing he can see you
[59:14] in is the way he saw you before the
[59:16] foundation of the world when he put your
[59:19] name on the land's Book of Life that's
[59:22] all you can look at because you are
[59:24] redeemed from everything
[59:26] that was ever done you are washed in the
[59:29] blood of the Lamb you say amen amen
[59:34] therefore there's no goal in you there's
[59:37] no unclean Habit in you because that
[59:41] blood of the Lamb has did this and God
[59:44] cannot impute sin to you after you have
[59:47] got a sin offering laying there waiting
[59:50] for
[59:51] you so Jesus was identified as the Lamb
[59:56] of
[59:57] God the Earthly creature the most pure
[1:00:02] and innocent of all Earthly creatures
[1:00:07] see and those are the only two Natures
[1:00:10] that will unite upon the earth that is
[1:00:14] God the dove which God presented to Adam
[1:00:18] and Eve in the the same
[1:00:21] lamb he showed him the way back was by
[1:00:25] the way of the
[1:00:27] Lamb amen and the way back was the way
[1:00:30] back to the dove amen that's why we go
[1:00:34] through water baptism we repent we are
[1:00:36] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:00:39] are identified with the lamb and then
[1:00:41] God comes with the Dove and he fills you
[1:00:43] with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:45] now lives in you amen so once you
[1:00:48] receive the Holy Ghost you're now God's
[1:00:51] Property you belong to him amen so the
[1:00:56] dve presented Adam and Eve with a
[1:00:57] chemistry of the symbol of the life that
[1:01:00] would be manifested on earth so the dove
[1:01:03] could not Unite with the chemistry of
[1:01:06] the life of an
[1:01:08] animal it was pointing to the day when
[1:01:11] the Dove and the lamb will be United
[1:01:14] again when Heaven and Earth would
[1:01:17] Embrace each other again like it did
[1:01:20] before the fall Hallelujah and they
[1:01:24] remain strangers and Aliens that's why
[1:01:26] the Old Testament Saints they worship
[1:01:28] but they only had partial Redemption see
[1:01:32] they remain strangers they were aliens
[1:01:35] from the Commonwealth of God until the
[1:01:38] real Lamb of God came with the undefiled
[1:01:43] blood of God then that which was in part
[1:01:47] was done away with see they were not
[1:01:51] perfect because in that which is perfect
[1:01:53] is come the perfect life of God God in
[1:01:58] human flesh again then that which is
[1:02:01] impart the chemistry will be done away
[1:02:04] with Hallelujah so we find that the real
[1:02:07] lamb could come
[1:02:12] sorry the real lamb could come together
[1:02:16] so that we could be Sons and Daughters
[1:02:18] of God again see Adam and Eve man and
[1:02:23] woman that was God's whole purpose
[1:02:26] was to bring it back to where it fell
[1:02:28] from that's what Redemption means to
[1:02:31] bring back to its original condition so
[1:02:34] we find in the first Exodus from Egypt
[1:02:37] God required a chemistry as a token and
[1:02:41] the token for the believer today is the
[1:02:44] Holy Ghost the literal life of Jesus
[1:02:47] Christ amen the dove in The Believer the
[1:02:52] very life of God the attribute of of God
[1:02:56] the gene of God now dwelling in the
[1:02:59] human body amen the great logos God is
[1:03:03] gathering all his subjects together upon
[1:03:06] the Earth those who are not a part of
[1:03:09] God they will not accept the message of
[1:03:11] the hour you can try whatever you do you
[1:03:14] can give them money to join the message
[1:03:16] they are not going to stay see it's got
[1:03:19] to be a part of God an offspring from
[1:03:22] God hallelujah so we find that the not
[1:03:26] an blood or chemistry but the Holy
[1:03:29] Spirit the father's spiritual genes is
[1:03:32] what God is gathering together God must
[1:03:36] see the token today that God and man is
[1:03:40] United together amen not a chemistry
[1:03:44] that is what Redemption means to bring
[1:03:46] it back all the years through all the
[1:03:49] time since the fall of Man God has been
[1:03:52] working to get it back to Eden again
[1:03:56] Hallelujah the lamb and the Dove and we
[1:03:59] find that the lamb and the dove is
[1:04:01] associated together throughout the Bible
[1:04:04] from Genesis to Revelation the lamb and
[1:04:08] the dove God and man Hallelujah so we
[1:04:13] find back in Egypt they were living in
[1:04:15] the shadows of judgment and now brother
[1:04:18] and sister we are living again in the
[1:04:20] shadows of judgment and God is again
[1:04:23] requiring a token Hallelujah and we find
[1:04:27] in Egypt the chemistry of the blood had
[1:04:30] to be placed on the lentil and on the
[1:04:33] doorpost it was a sign of the cross they
[1:04:36] were looking to Calvary the day when the
[1:04:39] real Lamb of God was going to be slain
[1:04:42] so God saw reflected on Earth what he
[1:04:46] saw in heaven his people in the land of
[1:04:49] Egypt in the land of Goan covered by the
[1:04:53] blood of the Lamb it was the blood in
[1:04:57] type amen it was pointing to the lamb at
[1:05:00] Calvary all those whose names are
[1:05:02] written in the L's Book of Life they're
[1:05:05] the only ones that are considered in
[1:05:08] Redemption so brother brah says
[1:05:10] everybody coming by could see the
[1:05:12] chemistry of the blood on the door a
[1:05:14] sign that a life had died amen a token
[1:05:19] that the life that was in the lamb has
[1:05:22] returned back amen and today he says
[1:05:25] everyone talking to you or associating
[1:05:28] with you can see that the blood has been
[1:05:31] applied to you the token life that was
[1:05:34] in the blood is upon you and you are
[1:05:35] saved so Jesus was the perfect
[1:05:39] sacrifice God himself becoming the
[1:05:43] atonement when he was made flesh and
[1:05:47] Allelujah he made a way that the life of
[1:05:50] God the holy image of God could come
[1:05:54] back to man again Hallelujah so we find
[1:05:58] in Hebrews 11 it says all these they
[1:06:01] wondered about in sheep skins and goat
[1:06:04] skin they were destitute they were uh
[1:06:09] rejected they were Sor aunder they saw
[1:06:12] the kingdom whose Builder and maker was
[1:06:15] God it says here in verse 36 and others
[1:06:19] had trial and cruel mockings and
[1:06:21] scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[1:06:24] prisonment the they were stoned they
[1:06:26] were sown a suer they were tempted they
[1:06:28] were slain with a sword they wandered
[1:06:30] about in sheep skin and goat sking being
[1:06:33] DED Afflicted tormented of whom the
[1:06:37] world was not
[1:06:39] worthy and these all having obtained a
[1:06:43] good
[1:06:44] report through faith received not the
[1:06:48] promise God having provided some better
[1:06:52] thing for us that they without us
[1:06:56] cannot be made perfect
[1:07:00] hallelujah amen brother brandom says
[1:07:03] here that in a message called uh uh uh
[1:07:06] you must be born again he said she
[1:07:09] couldn't get scared there was nothing
[1:07:10] about her to scare she had perfect love
[1:07:13] the love caused out fear Adam said come
[1:07:16] here and Edom and and Eve he says there
[1:07:19] was no fear in the Garden of Eden but
[1:07:23] what was the worship like in the garden
[1:07:25] of Eden he says they went up into the
[1:07:29] woods the Timber and perhaps the that
[1:07:33] the Loos that went out of god let's say
[1:07:37] it was in the form of a pillar of fire
[1:07:41] now we have prophetic privilege amen he
[1:07:43] saw by Vision so here he says that they
[1:07:47] that the lust that went out of god let's
[1:07:50] say it was in the form of a pillar of
[1:07:51] fire Halo I can see it just hanging in
[1:07:55] the bush
[1:07:56] Yonder and the streaks from it shining
[1:07:59] down when Adam and Eve knelt before the
[1:08:02] Creator to
[1:08:05] worship that's that was their kind of
[1:08:07] worship they came before that Halo the
[1:08:10] pillar of fire the logos in the G of
[1:08:13] Eden he said I can hear the voice coming
[1:08:16] from it and says as my children enjoy
[1:08:19] their stay today upon the Earth that the
[1:08:22] Lord thy God has given thee and they
[1:08:24] said yes Father
[1:08:26] so they desired a
[1:08:28] kingdom see whose Builder and maker was
[1:08:33] God but that Kingdom could not uh ex
[1:08:37] that Kingdom that existed before the
[1:08:40] fall that's the kingdom that they
[1:08:42] desired but that Kingdom could not be
[1:08:45] restored until the Lamb of God
[1:08:50] came with the blood of God to pay for
[1:08:54] the sins of the world the world that God
[1:08:57] had in his mind when he placed those
[1:09:00] names on the land's Book of Life
[1:09:02] Hallelujah before the foundation of the
[1:09:05] world Amen but God accepted a substitute
[1:09:09] blood of an innocent animal the
[1:09:11] chemistry without the life until the
[1:09:16] real Lamb of God came with the very life
[1:09:20] of God on the inside which be would be
[1:09:23] the dwelling place of of the logos amen
[1:09:27] the image of God back in the Tabernacle
[1:09:31] of a man again that is why when John saw
[1:09:34] the Loos descending like a dove he said
[1:09:37] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:09:40] the sin of the world the lamb and the
[1:09:44] dove was connected together
[1:09:47] again there was the real Lamb of God the
[1:09:52] one that God showed in type to Adam and
[1:09:54] Eve through an animal but here was
[1:09:58] Emmanuel amen for the first time since
[1:10:01] the fall they saw the dove the image of
[1:10:04] God coming back into the image of man
[1:10:08] again Hallelujah Heaven and Earth
[1:10:11] embraced each other amen what a day that
[1:10:15] was this is what he says in the message
[1:10:17] do uh love and the dove Abode in the
[1:10:22] lamb he stayed there he was
[1:10:27] Emmanuel God was in his
[1:10:30] Tabernacle the Son of God which was
[1:10:32] Jesus was the Flesh of God a man
[1:10:37] Tabernacle that God dwelt here on
[1:10:41] Earth and now that was Christ and God
[1:10:46] became
[1:10:47] United he was divided in Eden he left
[1:10:51] the image of God but here we find God is
[1:10:53] working his way back to Eden when the
[1:10:55] image of God came back into an undefiled
[1:10:59] bloodstream into the image of man again
[1:11:02] and brother BR say that's the way God
[1:11:05] could be seen no man has seen the father
[1:11:08] at any time but the only begotten of the
[1:11:11] father hath declared him he says here in
[1:11:14] the message future home paragraph
[1:11:17] 310 when he went up out of the water he
[1:11:20] said I saw Heavens
[1:11:22] open the prophet saw it he saw Heavens
[1:11:27] open and here come descending Out of
[1:11:30] Heaven in the form of a dove and a voice
[1:11:34] saying this is my part of the earth that
[1:11:38] I have
[1:11:40] redeemed and from this part of the earth
[1:11:43] I will redeem the rest of
[1:11:46] it see for he is my word made
[1:11:50] manifest and the whole world has spoken
[1:11:53] into existence Hew Hebrews 11 and Satan
[1:11:57] has held it all this time but I've come
[1:12:01] to redeem it See Redemption is not only
[1:12:04] for the sons of God but it's also for
[1:12:07] the Earth it's gone through a water
[1:12:08] baptism it went through a sanctification
[1:12:11] and now the fire baptism and then you
[1:12:13] saw the heaven amen the the the the the
[1:12:16] New Jerusalem coming God down from God
[1:12:18] out of Heaven as a bride adorned for a
[1:12:21] husband amen and the whole world I spoke
[1:12:25] into existence Satan has held it all
[1:12:27] this time but I've come to redeem it so
[1:12:29] much of it has made his body and I'm
[1:12:33] coming to dwell in it the Earth is going
[1:12:37] to be God's Dwelling Place amen you that
[1:12:40] pyamid City and the lamb will be at the
[1:12:43] top of the city and there will be no
[1:12:45] more sun for the lamb is the light
[1:12:49] they'll be no more night there amen he
[1:12:51] said John said I saw the holy city the
[1:12:54] new Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
[1:12:57] as a bride Adorn for a husband and where
[1:13:00] they settled on just exactly like it did
[1:13:04] there upon the Earth so Jesus was a
[1:13:07] prefigure from this portion I'm going to
[1:13:10] claim the whole earth because through
[1:13:12] his death redemption is come to everyone
[1:13:16] everyone whose names are written on the
[1:13:17] Book of Life all the Earth is all
[1:13:20] redeemed through this sacrifice see it
[1:13:23] can never leave him it's always there he
[1:13:26] and God are one and so John saw the holy
[1:13:29] city the New Jerusalem the sitting like
[1:13:31] a comet a dove coming out of heaven and
[1:13:35] setting upon the redeemed entire Earth
[1:13:37] to claim every attribute that made the
[1:13:41] Earth for every man that was represented
[1:13:44] in eternity and every woman is redeemed
[1:13:49] then she has been scoured and burned by
[1:13:54] fire
[1:13:56] Jesus in his fiery Temptation in the
[1:13:58] wilderness for 40 days after that notice
[1:14:02] it was ready for his ministry then think
[1:14:04] of it the Holy Ghost descending upon the
[1:14:07] Earth Jesus that Holy Blood now watch
[1:14:12] and I hope I don't go too deep for you
[1:14:16] the Holy Blood that was created by God
[1:14:18] the blood the life the creation of God
[1:14:21] Jesus was the beginning of the creation
[1:14:23] of God you see it God made in creation
[1:14:28] his Spirit see he is the beginning of
[1:14:32] the creation Now listen to what brother
[1:14:35] brand says now in paragraph 317 like how
[1:14:39] them blind people can't see the serpent
[1:14:42] seed that's right Eve was put here on
[1:14:45] Earth and before Satan ever touched the
[1:14:49] see or anything else God said to them
[1:14:53] multiply and replenish the
[1:14:56] Earth that's right but Satan comes in
[1:15:00] here and if that was Adam's son see Adam
[1:15:04] was a direct descent from
[1:15:08] God and you only take the nature of your
[1:15:13] parent and when you are born again you
[1:15:15] take the nature of your
[1:15:18] parent the heaven of heaven and your
[1:15:21] parent of Heaven is the attribute of the
[1:15:26] word see the word is the attribute of
[1:15:29] your parent then how can you deny it for
[1:15:33] a denomination oh my so the very
[1:15:36] attribute of God becomes now manifested
[1:15:40] in you amen that little size of a button
[1:15:45] now God hasn't got strong Parts he
[1:15:47] hasn't got weak Parts you got had little
[1:15:49] size of a button you can create the
[1:15:51] world and you can go live a private life
[1:15:53] on it amen why because every bit of God
[1:15:57] is is God Amen all of God is is got
[1:16:00] power to create amen that's why God was
[1:16:04] in the process of restoring the kingdom
[1:16:08] as it was before the fall the image of
[1:16:12] God the dove left Adam in Eden but came
[1:16:15] back when the logos descended Upon Jesus
[1:16:20] amen it brought back the life of the
[1:16:23] Resurrection that's why without the
[1:16:26] return of the logos or the dove there
[1:16:28] could be no
[1:16:30] Resurrection there could be no
[1:16:33] Perfection because there's only one
[1:16:35] that's perfect and that's God Amen so
[1:16:39] Jesus shed his blood to sanctify the
[1:16:41] church so that the logos could come into
[1:16:44] the church see so under day of Pentecost
[1:16:47] it was a Sanctified Church by the blood
[1:16:51] of Jesus Christ that's why he went to
[1:16:54] Calvary to sanctify the church so that
[1:16:57] the Holy Ghost had came upon him in the
[1:16:59] River Jordan could come back the pillar
[1:17:02] of fire and divide itself out into the
[1:17:05] first church see that's why there could
[1:17:08] only be a restoration when the Holy
[1:17:10] Ghost comes back at the end time for
[1:17:13] 2,000 years the Holy Ghost was was no
[1:17:16] longer in the church because they
[1:17:20] nominated amen because that church fell
[1:17:22] in IA Rome but after 20 th years the
[1:17:26] Holy Ghost came back again the P of fire
[1:17:29] appeared for the first time again to do
[1:17:32] what to turn the hearts of the children
[1:17:35] to the faith of the fathers amen the
[1:17:39] attribute of God now divided amongst his
[1:17:41] children again the same as it was on the
[1:17:45] day of Pentecost
[1:17:48] Hallelujah so we find here that God was
[1:17:52] in the process of restoring the kingdom
[1:17:55] the pillar of fire that led the children
[1:17:57] of Israel through the Wilderness to the
[1:17:59] land of the Resurrection that dwelt in
[1:18:01] the body of Jesus came on the first day
[1:18:05] on the day of Pentecost amen that's
[1:18:08] where we are now it's the Holy Ghost the
[1:18:11] pillar of fire in the Church of God now
[1:18:15] that's why the Rapture is already in
[1:18:18] process we are only waiting for the
[1:18:21] changing of the body but on the inside
[1:18:24] we have already been raptured I'll read
[1:18:26] the quotation right now Amen brother
[1:18:30] says how did this great py the angel of
[1:18:33] God the lust that went out of God that
[1:18:36] led the children of Israel through the
[1:18:38] Wilderness when it come among the people
[1:18:40] it separated itself and the great leaks
[1:18:43] of fire begin to come upon each one as
[1:18:47] the pillar of fire began to break
[1:18:50] up the one that they couldn't touch in
[1:18:53] the Old Testament if an animal touched
[1:18:55] the mountain it was killed but yet that
[1:18:57] very same one of Sanctified by the blood
[1:19:00] comes and divide itself up in the first
[1:19:03] church on the day of Pentecost
[1:19:07] amen God divided himself among his
[1:19:10] people oh that ought to tear the heart
[1:19:12] of
[1:19:13] anybody God tearing himself apart that
[1:19:17] he might divide
[1:19:19] himself a little bit with each one of us
[1:19:23] that all together together Hallelujah he
[1:19:27] says on day of Pentecost when the pillar
[1:19:29] of fire came down over the people did
[1:19:31] you notice it separated
[1:19:34] itself see the tongues of fire set upon
[1:19:38] each one of them fire like tongues
[1:19:41] setting on each one what was God doing
[1:19:45] separating himself into his
[1:19:48] church see that's why when you appeared
[1:19:52] on Sunset Mountain it was the rising of
[1:19:54] the sun Isaiah says Rise Shine for thy
[1:19:58] light has come the glory of the Lord is
[1:20:01] risen upon thee his glory shall be seen
[1:20:05] upon thee this was that faith that was
[1:20:07] now going to turn the hearts of the
[1:20:08] children to the faith of the fathers
[1:20:12] that's why he says the message of
[1:20:13] Malachi 4 he's got to do two things
[1:20:16] reveal the mystery of the Thunders and
[1:20:18] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:20:19] faith of the fathers he says these
[1:20:22] divinely revealed truth will literally
[1:20:26] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:20:28] faith of the fathers
[1:20:31] amen he says here giving the wom and Men
[1:20:35] all kind of them parts of the spirit
[1:20:37] dividing himself the Holy Ghost separate
[1:20:40] itself on the day of Pentecost God
[1:20:43] separating himself in that day you'll
[1:20:47] know that I am in the father I in you
[1:20:52] and you in me
[1:20:55] Hallelujah he says in the Easter seal
[1:20:58] paragraph 113 and you are quickened and
[1:21:03] this quickening power brings your body
[1:21:06] into a raptured condition
[1:21:10] already so you're already in a raptured
[1:21:13] condition when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:21:15] you amen notice the Pentecostal people
[1:21:19] up there when they got quickened by the
[1:21:21] Holy Spirit listen to me when those
[1:21:23] Pentecostal group up there on their
[1:21:25] Pentecost received their abstract Deed
[1:21:28] from God it glorified their soul they
[1:21:31] screamed they saw tongues of fire
[1:21:33] separating upon each and it so Quicken
[1:21:35] their body till they couldn't even speak
[1:21:38] in an Earthly language anymore it
[1:21:41] quickened their body to a Heavenly
[1:21:43] language the place where they were going
[1:21:45] to they were raptured amen when the
[1:21:49] power of God Came Upon them Hallelujah
[1:21:53] so the church fell at n Rome and for
[1:21:57] 2,000 years the Holy Ghost was bound by
[1:22:01] mindmade Creeds and dogmas but God said
[1:22:04] I will restore sayith the Lord all the
[1:22:07] years that the cankerworm the
[1:22:08] caterpillar the Palmer worm amen I will
[1:22:11] restore sayeth the Lord hallelujah the
[1:22:15] logos of God will return again at the
[1:22:17] end time the dove will return again
[1:22:22] Hallelujah to be United with those whose
[1:22:24] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:22:28] Life amen Malachi 4 Luke
[1:22:32] 730 amen the heart of the children will
[1:22:35] be restored at the time at the seven
[1:22:37] thunders of Revelations 10 when the Lost
[1:22:40] of Dove returns again so remember
[1:22:43] brother BR says there's a written word
[1:22:46] and there's also the unwritten word amen
[1:22:49] he says when the seals are broken I'll
[1:22:51] read the quotation to you now he says uh
[1:22:54] okay before I get there let me read he
[1:22:57] says in the end time evangelism now
[1:23:00] we're going to end right here by saying
[1:23:02] this the end time message is to get the
[1:23:05] bride ready and prepared for the
[1:23:09] Rapture what can it do according to
[1:23:12] Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the
[1:23:15] faith that once was delivered to the
[1:23:17] Saints bring them back to the faith of
[1:23:20] the fathers the Pentecostal part in the
[1:23:23] restoration I will restore saith the
[1:23:27] Lord he says here in questions and
[1:23:30] answers paragraph 57 so all these little
[1:23:33] things are jumping up and
[1:23:35] down hallelujah amen so the resurrection
[1:23:40] could not take place until the pillar of
[1:23:43] fire came back again the lcus of God
[1:23:47] returned back because without us they
[1:23:50] cannot be made perfect amen he said when
[1:23:55] that which is perfect is come then that
[1:23:58] which is impart shall be done away with
[1:24:01] he says here so these little things of
[1:24:03] jumping up and down like a kid trying to
[1:24:06] talk in tongues and all these other
[1:24:08] things when that which is perfect and we
[1:24:11] do have today by God's help the perfect
[1:24:14] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:24:18] Vindication he says here but as has been
[1:24:22] every age in modern events
[1:24:25] is been in every age people let man put
[1:24:28] their own interpretation to it by
[1:24:33] Theology and will not believe God's
[1:24:36] Divine Vindication of it God's
[1:24:39] interpretation not what I say that's
[1:24:42] what the prophet says see but what
[1:24:46] somebody else says but what God has
[1:24:49] promised and what God does proves that
[1:24:52] it's God doing his own interpretation by
[1:24:57] his word amen who could manifest Luke 13
[1:25:01] God had to come and do it himself
[1:25:04] William Bram couldn't do it so God came
[1:25:07] amen did with his back to the
[1:25:09] congregation and he started Discerning
[1:25:11] the hearts of the people amen he told
[1:25:13] Sarah what she was thinking in the tent
[1:25:15] behind him amen that wasn't a man that
[1:25:19] was God the Loos amen the word in a man
[1:25:24] many manifesting the promise for the
[1:25:26] hour amen so the Holy Spirit the Loos
[1:25:30] has come to vindicate the word and lead
[1:25:33] the people so let every man's word be a
[1:25:37] liive and God's word be the truth he
[1:25:41] says in the message
[1:25:43] Elijah how many knows that the first
[1:25:46] time Jesus appeared to lead the people
[1:25:48] he was in the form of a pillar of
[1:25:51] fire so brother brandham says here that
[1:25:54] that purifier that led the children of
[1:25:56] Israel through the Wilderness it was
[1:25:59] Jesus see the angel of the Covenant led
[1:26:02] the children of Israel the second time
[1:26:06] he appeared he was in the form of a man
[1:26:10] called
[1:26:12] Jesus the third time he appears he's in
[1:26:14] the form of the spirit called the Holy
[1:26:19] Spirit he says he's just the same today
[1:26:23] as he was when he was led the children
[1:26:25] of the pillar of fire it's only thing
[1:26:28] that it is God
[1:26:30] condescending bringing himself
[1:26:34] down amen and the next thing he comes
[1:26:37] down born of a virgin right what's God
[1:26:41] doing breaking this blood cell to
[1:26:44] sanctify a church that he could come
[1:26:46] down himself and have fellowship with
[1:26:49] the people see God loves you you
[1:26:53] couldn't do nothing about it he brought
[1:26:56] himself down and cleansed his way his
[1:26:58] road that he could come through a away
[1:27:01] sin till he could come down and
[1:27:05] fellowship with Adam
[1:27:08] again so God had one thing in mind
[1:27:12] Eden it must go back to Eden again from
[1:27:15] Genesis Revelation he was working on
[1:27:17] this one purpose to get things back to
[1:27:20] where the dove could make its way back
[1:27:22] home again amen he says it wasn't so
[1:27:26] from the beginning now if that is the
[1:27:28] same light The Same Spirit it will
[1:27:30] perform in the church the same thing
[1:27:32] that it did when it was in him for he
[1:27:36] said a little while the world seeth me
[1:27:38] no more but ye shall see me now the
[1:27:42] works that I do shall you do also More
[1:27:45] Than This shall you do for I go to my
[1:27:48] father right and here we find towards
[1:27:51] the end god making his own
[1:27:54] way back to fellowship with Adam's
[1:27:58] children as it did with Adam before the
[1:28:04] fall he says in paragraph 23 to me my
[1:28:08] brethren not because of the light he
[1:28:12] never had his speak andure taken that's
[1:28:14] that picture there because it was mean
[1:28:17] there NOA it was because of the message
[1:28:20] of Pentecost that I represent
[1:28:25] amen hallelujah so the first church the
[1:28:28] kingdom Church started on the day of
[1:28:32] Pentecost fell it I see Rome but God
[1:28:35] promised I will restore in the token he
[1:28:38] says the church in this day that
[1:28:41] received the token of the baptism of the
[1:28:43] holy spirit that the blood has been shed
[1:28:46] and that the Holy Ghost is upon the
[1:28:48] church without us they cannot
[1:28:51] rise amen so everyone waited for the
[1:28:55] return of the love they waited for the
[1:28:59] return of the pillar of fire the return
[1:29:02] of the logos God coming to to manifest
[1:29:06] himself through man again but they're
[1:29:09] depending on us for God promised he
[1:29:11] would have it and somebody is going to
[1:29:13] be there I don't know who is going to be
[1:29:15] there but somebody is going to receive
[1:29:18] it the one only thing I'm responsible is
[1:29:22] to preach it he says here and remember
[1:29:26] Israel came through many things but it
[1:29:29] was in the evening time when the token
[1:29:31] was
[1:29:33] required not in the morning not in the
[1:29:36] preparation the 14 days of keeping up of
[1:29:39] the Lamb Israel knowed something was
[1:29:42] coming this is what he says now so did
[1:29:46] Luther know it so did Wesley know it so
[1:29:50] did finny and Knox and Calvin know it
[1:29:53] this is
[1:29:55] it they knew there would come a time
[1:29:58] that the pillar of fire would return
[1:30:01] back to the church again Hallelujah so
[1:30:05] Israel so Israel knew that something was
[1:30:08] coming and while they were in Egypt they
[1:30:11] applied the chemistry of the land's
[1:30:13] blood a token that they believe the
[1:30:16] prophet's message that's why the prophet
[1:30:19] says obedience to every word entitles
[1:30:22] you to the token
[1:30:24] and Israel when they applied the blood
[1:30:27] showed that they came into obedience to
[1:30:29] the word of the Prophet which he
[1:30:32] received from the pillar of fire amen so
[1:30:36] obedience to every word but from the
[1:30:38] chemistry of the Lamb's blood they came
[1:30:40] again under the leadership of the logos
[1:30:44] they came under the leadership of the
[1:30:45] dove the pillar of fire that led them to
[1:30:49] the land of the Resurrection again we
[1:30:52] see the land
[1:30:54] and the dove amen where Abraham and
[1:30:57] Isaac and Jacob was buried amen
[1:31:01] hallelujah the land where the lamb and
[1:31:04] the dove will be United together LED
[1:31:07] them all the way back to Palestine from
[1:31:11] the chemistry of the church ages to the
[1:31:14] dove the pillar of fire returning
[1:31:18] leading the bride in the Third Exodus a
[1:31:22] rapturing faith the resurrection from
[1:31:25] Mortal to
[1:31:27] immortality that's why Joseph said don't
[1:31:29] bury my bones down here the day you
[1:31:32] leave Egypt take my bones with you amen
[1:31:35] the resurrection is going to take place
[1:31:37] in the land of the Resurrection where
[1:31:40] the man and God will be United together
[1:31:43] again Hallelujah and they took Joseph's
[1:31:46] bone with him so from the ministry of
[1:31:49] the chemistry of the church ages to the
[1:31:52] leadership of the pillar of fire that's
[1:31:55] why we are no longer in the church ages
[1:31:58] we have come out of that we are now in
[1:32:00] the bright age amen the dove has come
[1:32:04] the Holy Ghost has come the pillar of
[1:32:06] fire has come to lead the church see we
[1:32:10] are no longer with Luther we are no
[1:32:12] longer with Wesley we are no longer with
[1:32:15] Pentecost but Amen brother say they did
[1:32:18] not live long enough to see the coming
[1:32:20] of the pillar of fire Hallelujah but we
[1:32:23] Are Witnesses of the return of the logos
[1:32:26] our eyes have seen the glory of the
[1:32:28] coming of the Lord hallelujah the lamb
[1:32:32] blood was placed on the door as a token
[1:32:34] in the evening time that they believed
[1:32:37] the message of the pillar of fire so all
[1:32:40] those who believe the message of the
[1:32:41] pillar of fire were the ones that were
[1:32:44] gathered under the leadership of the
[1:32:47] pillar of fire in The Exodus amen it was
[1:32:51] the lamb it was the blood through Luther
[1:32:53] it was the blood through Wesley he
[1:32:56] preached sanctification Luther preached
[1:32:59] justification a but now we are beyond
[1:33:02] that we are beyond the chemistry we are
[1:33:05] now in Hallelujah the token the very
[1:33:09] life of Jesus Christ amen so how do we
[1:33:13] get into the house of God by one's birth
[1:33:16] we are baptized into the body of Christ
[1:33:20] Hallelujah say today the Holy Ghost
[1:33:22] itself not the blood it was not amen
[1:33:25] that was shed even at Calvary because
[1:33:28] the blood that was shed at Calvary went
[1:33:30] back into its chemistry amen went back
[1:33:33] Amen to its uh to it dried up amen but
[1:33:37] inside the blood was a Life Cell it was
[1:33:40] that life that came back upon the
[1:33:42] believer as a token amen so that is why
[1:33:46] when his death when they cried they
[1:33:48] crucified Jesus he they could not kill
[1:33:51] him because they returned again
[1:33:54] in the form of the Holy Spirit to
[1:33:57] continue the work of the book of Acts
[1:34:00] Hallelujah I just want to go on further
[1:34:02] here so we find that Egypt typed the
[1:34:04] church and the world and Israel was a
[1:34:08] type of the bride and as she came out of
[1:34:11] Egypt as soon as she left Egypt she came
[1:34:14] under the leadership of the logos she
[1:34:17] came under the leadership of the dove
[1:34:19] leading them to the land of the
[1:34:22] Resurrection amen and out promised land
[1:34:24] is the son of man amen led us from the
[1:34:28] church ages into the promised land of
[1:34:31] the son of man Hallelujah out of the
[1:34:33] world churches we've come under the
[1:34:35] headship of the dove Hallelujah the lamb
[1:34:39] and the dove Associated together
[1:34:43] Revelations 5 and 6 it's the lamb
[1:34:46] breaking the seals and the lamb took the
[1:34:49] seals and he broke it amen but in
[1:34:51] Revelations 10 it's the Dove coming to
[1:34:55] give the bride faith for rapturing Grace
[1:35:00] brother Rah says here in the message is
[1:35:01] is the sign of the end time is on the
[1:35:04] back side when the book is
[1:35:07] completed not did he say on the front
[1:35:10] side he said on the back side after all
[1:35:14] is done completed then the seven Thunder
[1:35:17] voices is the only thing that's stuck to
[1:35:21] the book that's not revealed
[1:35:24] it's not even written in the book oh my
[1:35:28] I wish I could get that that the people
[1:35:32] he says don't fail please this time I'm
[1:35:36] fixing to leave you don't fail if you
[1:35:38] ever listen
[1:35:40] listen these seals on the back side of
[1:35:44] the book at that time that the seventh
[1:35:47] angel is sounding all the Mysteries that
[1:35:51] are written in the book is complete
[1:35:54] completed and immediately the book that
[1:35:57] was open and written within is
[1:36:01] closed amen that's the Book of Life the
[1:36:04] history of the church and all those
[1:36:06] things that is closed see the mysteries
[1:36:09] of God and this is the mysteries of God
[1:36:11] the going of the church and all the
[1:36:13] other things and the Mysteries is over
[1:36:15] and when the seventh angel sounds out
[1:36:17] every mystery it's over let him be what
[1:36:21] he made whatever it might be God God's
[1:36:23] word cannot fail but now is the mystery
[1:36:27] of the Thunders Revelations 10 is the
[1:36:30] coming of the dove the Covenant angel
[1:36:35] with the open book see so the lamb all
[1:36:38] the redeemed that the lamb died for the
[1:36:41] is now inside the book of the Lamb amen
[1:36:44] as I said earlier on the woman of the
[1:36:46] well he took her from The Book of Life
[1:36:49] and he revealed to her the Lamb's Book
[1:36:52] of Life so that that book of life was
[1:36:55] closed now another book was open amen so
[1:36:59] we find that the book inside the book
[1:37:02] see was the book in the Bible is those
[1:37:06] whose names are written in the land's
[1:37:08] book of life but also in the Bible you
[1:37:10] find those whose names on The Book of
[1:37:12] Life they only make part of the story
[1:37:16] they are what you call it they are the
[1:37:18] uh the additional actors you know they
[1:37:22] don't play an important role but the
[1:37:24] main role there are those whose names
[1:37:26] are written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:37:30] amen H Allelujah somebody use a a
[1:37:33] description once I can't remember it
[1:37:35] amen they use in the acting world see
[1:37:37] they just have the props they have there
[1:37:40] amen but the main thing is the real
[1:37:43] character and that is the bride the lamb
[1:37:46] amen and that's what it does in
[1:37:48] Revelations 10 another book was open so
[1:37:51] this is the Lamb's Book is now coming me
[1:37:53] to collect all that he died for because
[1:37:56] the Bible says the Beast that comes upon
[1:37:58] the Earth shall deceive all whose names
[1:38:02] were not written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:38:05] Life so what are we feeding from the
[1:38:08] Lamb's Book of Life it's the mystery of
[1:38:12] redemption the mystery of our position
[1:38:14] in Christ where we come from the mystery
[1:38:18] of the Rapture all comes up he says may
[1:38:20] the seven thunders of Revelation may he
[1:38:23] show the bride how to prepare for
[1:38:26] rapturing Faith amen see he says I miss
[1:38:31] I wish he see those seals On The Backs
[1:38:33] side of the book and at the time that
[1:38:35] the seventh angel is sounding at the
[1:38:38] Mysteries that are written in the book
[1:38:40] is
[1:38:42] completed and immediately the book that
[1:38:44] was open and written within is
[1:38:48] closed the mysteries of God finished and
[1:38:51] this is the mystery of God but when that
[1:38:53] seventh the angel sounds out every
[1:38:54] mystery is over let him be what he may
[1:38:58] whatever it might be God's word Can't
[1:39:02] Fail see so we find now its manifested
[1:39:07] word no longer written word because we
[1:39:10] were in the thoughts of God but now the
[1:39:12] time has come for that thought to be
[1:39:14] manifested see the written book is
[1:39:17] closed now but now it's the manifested
[1:39:19] word hallelujah the open book The be to
[1:39:23] see if all those whose names were not
[1:39:25] written in the land's book now it's
[1:39:27] manifested word the Holy Ghost himself
[1:39:31] the word the logos in human flesh they
[1:39:35] no longer Twain but they are one the
[1:39:37] uniting time and sign the invisible
[1:39:40] Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:39:43] Earthly bride who is this
[1:39:46] MDC amen he shows you where you come
[1:39:49] from shows where M we not of the worldly
[1:39:52] order but we of the mesic order amen we
[1:39:56] have no beginning of days we have no
[1:39:57] ending of life that's where we started
[1:40:00] for we've got our record started even
[1:40:02] before the world began when the morning
[1:40:05] Stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:40:07] shouted for Joy amen hallelujah brother
[1:40:12] Bram says here in the unveiling of God
[1:40:14] so now we are invited into him to be
[1:40:19] partakers of all that he is we are
[1:40:22] invited into him him which is hid to the
[1:40:26] unbelievers by the veil of human flesh
[1:40:29] see they know that Glory they read of it
[1:40:33] it's in a word here glory to God and
[1:40:37] things like that it's just a word to
[1:40:41] them to us it's a
[1:40:44] manifestation see it's no more a word
[1:40:48] it's
[1:40:49] reality amen so you now become the
[1:40:51] Living Word the epistle R of all man see
[1:40:57] God said let there be light and that was
[1:40:59] the word but now there's light it ain't
[1:41:02] the word it's the light see what I
[1:41:06] mean now it isn't just a written word to
[1:41:09] us it's a
[1:41:11] reality we are in him we are
[1:41:16] enjoying now we Behold Him now we see
[1:41:20] him the word manifesting his
[1:41:23] himself see they they stumbl at the veil
[1:41:28] William brandham but they never look
[1:41:30] Beyond the Veil The Mighty God unveiled
[1:41:32] before us they could not see the
[1:41:34] unveiling of God Amen God coming to
[1:41:37] fulfill his promised word to them is
[1:41:40] still the word they preach out of the
[1:41:41] word they preach about Luke 730 but to
[1:41:44] us we see Luke 730 we see the word
[1:41:48] manifested word manifested before our
[1:41:50] eyes to us it's the reality to them it's
[1:41:52] still a promise amen they are waiting
[1:41:55] for these things to happen now it's just
[1:41:58] isn't the written word to us it's
[1:42:00] reality we are in him now we're enjoying
[1:42:05] now we Behold Him now we see him the
[1:42:08] word manifesting himself it's hid out
[1:42:12] there because why it's veiled in human
[1:42:17] flesh amen the dove leading the eagle to
[1:42:21] reveal the mystery of the unwritten
[1:42:25] seals amen so we find brother and
[1:42:28] sisters not like the Brethren thought
[1:42:30] before that it was those Seven Virtues
[1:42:32] Of The Seven Thunders amen it goes Bey
[1:42:34] it's not even that amen butam says that
[1:42:37] the pyramid is kept with seven Thunders
[1:42:41] he caps off the pyramid and we find that
[1:42:44] he always appears at the top of the
[1:42:46] pyramid amen that's why Enoch's pyramid
[1:42:49] could not be kept amen because it could
[1:42:51] not be sort of design or it had be hued
[1:42:55] out of the mountain but without human
[1:42:58] hands see so this took a supernatural
[1:43:01] molding this was a position for God
[1:43:04] himself to occupy because if we look far
[1:43:07] into the future that the lamb is
[1:43:10] situated right at the top of the pyramid
[1:43:13] and brother B God always speaks from the
[1:43:16] top of a
[1:43:17] mountain amen he always speaks from the
[1:43:20] top of the mountain and here we find
[1:43:21] even in the new Heavens in in the city
[1:43:23] for square is right at the top of the
[1:43:26] pyramid Mountain Hallelujah so here we
[1:43:30] find the dove leading the eagle to
[1:43:33] reveal the mysteries of the unwritten
[1:43:37] word he says here in the token notice
[1:43:39] then the preparation for his Promised
[1:43:43] Land
[1:43:45] people first he had a people that he had
[1:43:49] made a land for them he had prepared a
[1:43:53] land for them and now we sent down there
[1:43:57] a preparation for it for the promised
[1:44:00] land people it was only for those who
[1:44:03] were
[1:44:04] predestinated to the promised land the
[1:44:08] bride today see he sent a prophet with a
[1:44:13] message identified it by a pillar of
[1:44:17] fire and he gave a token that they could
[1:44:20] rest assured that it was
[1:44:24] right he says this is the antitype of
[1:44:28] the church coming out of
[1:44:30] denomination not all denominations I
[1:44:32] mean the the bride some people there is
[1:44:37] some of the Independence that just as
[1:44:39] bad as the denominations I'm talking
[1:44:42] about the applied token the token agrees
[1:44:46] with every word it's the life that was
[1:44:49] in the word my words there are Spirit
[1:44:53] and they are life amen so the ministry
[1:44:57] of John the Baptist Elijah of that day
[1:45:00] was to turn the hearts of the children
[1:45:02] to the faith of the fathers see the
[1:45:05] heart of the fathers to the children and
[1:45:08] the old traditions of the elders to the
[1:45:10] new faith of the dove leading the lamb
[1:45:14] that was the ministry of John and
[1:45:17] brother Braham says here in the wings of
[1:45:18] a dove
[1:45:19] notice the word come to the prophet in
[1:45:22] this dispensation of Grace in the
[1:45:26] water see job John saw the Holy Ghost
[1:45:31] the dove coming to the lamb revealing
[1:45:35] the true lamb revealing the presence of
[1:45:38] the Lamb Hallelujah brother bam says I
[1:45:42] thought you catch it in the water the
[1:45:46] first revelation of the word was in the
[1:45:49] water where the bride started
[1:45:53] as John the Baptist was sent to forun
[1:45:55] the first coming you are sent with a
[1:45:57] message to forun the second coming it
[1:46:01] started off in the water
[1:46:05] see the dove the evening light message
[1:46:08] in the water the word the two word not
[1:46:10] mixed up with Creed but came to the
[1:46:12] prophet in the water Braham says John
[1:46:16] knew being a prophet that the word had
[1:46:19] to be fulfilled that's why when Jesus
[1:46:22] died died on
[1:46:24] Calvary the Bible says he was wounded
[1:46:27] for our
[1:46:29] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:46:31] iniquity that just th and our pees upon
[1:46:34] him and with his stripes you are healed
[1:46:36] this is in the message on the wings of a
[1:46:38] d sickness Superstition and Devils had
[1:46:42] us pinned down there was nowhere out the
[1:46:45] church had gone wrong they went off in
[1:46:48] denominational things and Pharisees and
[1:46:50] Sadducees were washing off pots and pans
[1:46:53] the word of God became no effect but
[1:46:56] this little Dove came down and there was
[1:46:59] only one thing could take place there
[1:47:02] had to be a
[1:47:04] redeemer but being wounded broken beaten
[1:47:07] torn but he knew his way back home so
[1:47:11] from calvary's Cross they bruised him
[1:47:14] mashed him tore him like a bunch of
[1:47:17] wolves upon him he made his flight from
[1:47:20] Calvary and he landed on Heaven's doors
[1:47:22] saying it's finished it's finished they
[1:47:24] are free sickness can be healed now
[1:47:28] Sinners can be saved the captives could
[1:47:31] both set free though he was wounded and
[1:47:34] and bruised there great battle there
[1:47:37] when when even everything against him
[1:47:41] even the poet cried M rendering rocks
[1:47:44] and darkening Skies My Savior bowed his
[1:47:47] head and died the opening Veil revealed

[1:47:54] day Hallelujah it was the end of a
[1:47:58] suffering world of sickness and pain
[1:48:01] through his death on Calvary he made a
[1:48:03] way for our healing amen now the prophet
[1:48:06] said he was a neurotic all of his life
[1:48:10] every seven years he had a stomach
[1:48:12] problem that made him sick and at the
[1:48:15] age of
[1:48:17] 56 amen after eight sevens eight is the
[1:48:21] number of Eternity

[1:48:46] dispensation the number so there was a
[1:48:49] change amen when this Dove came he says
[1:48:52] here about Dove leading man and then I'm
[1:48:56] going to close I just want to read this
[1:48:58] little part here where the Lord showed
[1:49:01] the prophet now how that the ministry is
[1:49:04] now entered into another phase he says I
[1:49:07] had a strange dream his mom told him I
[1:49:11] dream that I seen you laying back sick
[1:49:14] just about to die with your stomach as
[1:49:18] usual how many diets she has cooked me
[1:49:21] and said you were building a house upon
[1:49:25] a hill a house upon a hill amen and I
[1:49:30] said I
[1:49:31] seen six white doves come down from
[1:49:35] heaven cooing in a letter S and they set
[1:49:39] upon your chest and he was looking and
[1:49:42] the one in front was trying to tell you
[1:49:45] something said they was real
[1:49:48] glossy white doves and they took their
[1:49:51] little heads and put it against your
[1:49:54] neck going Co cool cool and said I
[1:49:59] couldn't understand it said they just
[1:50:01] kept going cool cool I said oh I see it
[1:50:05] praise the Lord they form the letter s
[1:50:09] again and went up back into the skies
[1:50:12] going cool cool going back home well the
[1:50:17] little animal that I saw was 6 in Long
[1:50:22] the string of doves that Mom saw was six
[1:50:26] six is incomplete I knew that someday
[1:50:29] I'd see that seventh
[1:50:31] one that was man's suffering so on and
[1:50:36] on it went and that morning I rode up
[1:50:39] early it was a vision I obeyed the Lord
[1:50:43] I took my little boy Joseph to school
[1:50:46] he's listening to me now in tuon I took
[1:50:48] him to school and told maer I didn't
[1:50:52] know when I'd be back and I took off up
[1:50:56] into the calina the food deals and went
[1:50:59] up into the place where the angel of the
[1:51:01] Lord put the sword in my hand real early
[1:51:05] and started climbing up the mountain
[1:51:08] instead of going the Peaks this way
[1:51:10] which there was a lot of snakes see I
[1:51:13] just want to go a bit further down and
[1:51:15] along about 7:00 paragraph 197 I was
[1:51:18] going to a little Co back there a little
[1:51:20] place turn in like that this or over a
[1:51:23] little deer trail and I had my shirt off
[1:51:26] my hat in my hand because I was just
[1:51:29] Laing with sweat and so I turned in
[1:51:33] there and as I turned into that little
[1:51:34] Cove I felt the presence of the Lord I
[1:51:38] jerked up my hat and looked around I
[1:51:41] thought he's here somewhere I know he's
[1:51:44] here I thought what is it made a few
[1:51:47] more steps I said Lord you are here
[1:51:51] somewhere and I looked laying on the
[1:51:54] path and there lay the little squirrel
[1:51:57] had jumped at something and missed it
[1:52:00] and hit a bunch of CH that's jumping
[1:52:03] cactus it ran through his head chest
[1:52:06] stomach and was dead that oddl looking
[1:52:10] little squirrel he missed my mouth and
[1:52:12] hit the cha and the voice of the Lord
[1:52:15] said your enemy is dead I stood there I
[1:52:19] trembled I took my foot
[1:52:23] see and I'm just want to go a little bit
[1:52:25] further 202 I turned turned back around
[1:52:28] and came
[1:52:30] back it still laid there when I entered
[1:52:33] that Cove and the spirit of God came on
[1:52:35] me again I went around went down the
[1:52:38] mountain and went in told my wife I said
[1:52:42] honey I don't know how but I'm going to
[1:52:45] get over this Dr ravensworth when he
[1:52:48] gave me the examination he said it's
[1:52:51] totally impossible possible for you to
[1:52:53] be well he gave me a shot of pental see
[1:52:58] let just go a little bit further down
[1:53:00] here 205 and the next day something said
[1:53:03] go back to the mountain and that day
[1:53:06] instead of going one way I was led to go
[1:53:08] another way and I was standing there and
[1:53:12] looking sitting in front of me there sat
[1:53:15] that seventh Little White
[1:53:18] Dove looking right at me I rubbed my
[1:53:22] eyes I said surely it's a vision surely
[1:53:25] it is I looked and I said little Dove
[1:53:28] where do you come from just as pretty
[1:53:32] and white could have been a Pion
[1:53:34] whatever it was away in the
[1:53:37] wilderness say God Almighty who raised
[1:53:40] up Jesus from the dead whose servant I
[1:53:43] am and his word laying here open before
[1:53:46] me know that I tell the truth I lie not
[1:53:50] there said the dove looking at me I
[1:53:54] walked around I thought surely it's a
[1:53:57] vision turned my head I look back and
[1:54:00] there he said there them little white
[1:54:02] Wings just snowy as he could be he
[1:54:06] little yellow feet and little yellow
[1:54:08] beak sitting there looking at me he was
[1:54:12] watching right straight Westward I
[1:54:14] walked around like that I wouldn't touch
[1:54:17] him for nothing I looked on the upper
[1:54:19] Trail looked back and there's still
[1:54:23] watching me brother as a son of Abram I
[1:54:27] consider not what the doctor told me I'm
[1:54:30] going to be well
[1:54:33] anyhow the third day I went back I was
[1:54:36] climbing up high and many of you know
[1:54:39] the vision about the Indian chief riding
[1:54:41] that little wall to the West something
[1:54:44] attracted my attention off to a big rock
[1:54:47] about noon time said Lay Your Hands
[1:54:50] against that and pray
[1:54:52] God in heaven knows this is the TRU I
[1:54:55] laid my hand against The Rock and looked
[1:54:58] up towards heaven and started praying I
[1:55:01] Heard a Voice coming out the top of the
[1:55:03] Rocks there said what are you leaning
[1:55:06] against over your heart I rais back like
[1:55:10] this my bare shoulders naked from the
[1:55:13] waist up hot I look back and there was
[1:55:17] wrote in the courts in the stone White
[1:55:21] Eagle just exactly what the vision said
[1:55:25] that the next message message would come
[1:55:28] by I was so excited I ran home got a
[1:55:31] camera and came back and the next day I
