[37:34] there's only one name that men must be
[37:37] saved
[37:38] and that's by the name of the lord jesus
[37:40] christ amen so happy to be in the house
[37:42] of the lord again tonight
[37:44] we certainly appreciate what god's done
[37:46] for us this morning and we're asking
[37:48] that he would do it once more
[37:50] that he would visit us and be real
[37:52] special and tender to us
[37:54] like only he can be amen
[37:58] if you have your bibles we'll just go
[38:00] straight into the word of god
[38:03] we're going to be looking a little
[38:05] thought that inspired me
[38:07] by something brother billy said this
[38:09] morning and
[38:10] we'll just be taking a little subject
[38:14] we'll read the scripture out of first
[38:16] john
[38:17] chapter four
[38:39] in verse 7 it says beloved let us
[38:43] love one another for love
[38:47] is of god and everyone that loveth
[38:51] is born of god and knoweth god he that
[38:54] loveth not knoweth not god for god is
[38:58] love
[38:59] it was in this was manifested the love
[39:03] of god
[39:03] towards us because that god sent his
[39:06] only begotten son
[39:08] into the world that we might
[39:12] live through him wherein
[39:16] herein is love not that we love god
[39:20] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[39:23] be
[39:23] the perpetuation for our sins
[39:27] beloved if god so loved us
[39:30] we are also to love one another
[39:35] no man has seen god at any time
[39:38] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[39:40] us and his love is perfect in
[39:43] us hereby know we that the
[39:46] we dwell in him and he and us
[39:51] because he hath given us of his spirit
[39:54] and we have seen and do testify that the
[39:57] father sent the son to be
[39:58] the savior of the world so whosoever
[40:02] confessed that jesus
[40:03] is the son of god god dwelleth in him
[40:06] and he is in god and we know
[40:10] and believe the love of god hath to us
[40:13] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[40:16] dwelleth in god
[40:17] and god in him herein is
[40:21] our love made perfect that we may have
[40:24] boldness in the day of
[40:25] judgment because as he is so are we
[40:28] in this world there is no fear in love
[40:33] but perfect love cast out fear
[40:36] because fear hath torment he that
[40:39] feareth
[40:40] is not made perfect in love we love him
[40:44] because he first loved us if any man say
[40:47] i love
[40:47] god and hateth his brother he is a liar
[40:51] for he hath loved not his brother whom
[40:53] he hath seen
[40:55] how can he love god whom he had not seen
[40:58] and this commandment hath we from
[41:01] him that he who loved god loves
[41:05] his brother also amen i just think about
[41:09] you know brother david spoke on
[41:11] wednesday about focusing in on the love
[41:14] the love of god that was projected to us
[41:16] and how it will
[41:17] cause us to grow in faith amen that's
[41:19] why we're here to find out
[41:21] where we lack where our bad parts are
[41:24] but it's
[41:24] the love of god that comes to us that
[41:27] brings that healing sad
[41:29] that brings us the revelation that we're
[41:31] all hungry amen
[41:32] so if you desire revelation today if you
[41:35] desire another touch of the love of god
[41:37] why don't we just lift our hearts and
[41:39] hands to him and just pray together
[41:41] heavenly father lord god we read your
[41:44] eternal word lord
[41:45] and we know god that we didn't love you
[41:48] lord we were running from you but you
[41:50] came to us
[41:51] lord in that great love where in you
[41:54] loved us lord and you died while we were
[41:56] yet sinners
[41:57] father we just received that love
[41:59] tonight lord and even as
[42:02] our brother billy said that talking life
[42:04] this morning oh what a message
[42:06] lord and how when we receive that lord
[42:09] there's something that compels us to
[42:11] call for what we have need of lord
[42:14] we can hear the prophet's voice echoing
[42:16] in our hearts saying
[42:18] there could be never over emphasize the
[42:20] need to call on god for revelation lord
[42:23] we pray that as we speak tonight your
[42:25] spirit would open your word
[42:27] lord may we be changed from glory to
[42:30] glory lord may you
[42:31] oh god in this service move freely lord
[42:34] we just commit it all to you
[42:36] we pray in jesus christ's name amen
[42:40] praise the lord you may have your seeds
[42:45] don't believe i'll be very long we just
[42:47] want to try to express our heart
[42:49] in the way that it came to us and you
[42:52] know we just realized
[42:54] you know what god has given us
[42:57] we're definitely a very privileged
[42:58] people to be able to ask god
[43:01] knowing that he'll hear us and will
[43:03] respond
[43:04] because he's our father and even as it
[43:06] was mentioned in prayer
[43:08] that god's great love is so attentive
[43:12] to our needs amen so the
[43:16] the thing that i wanted to kind of share
[43:19] with you
[43:20] is something that brother branham said
[43:22] out of the message desperations
[43:25] and i'll just read a little quote and
[43:27] we'll just launch from that point
[43:29] the the message desperations paragraph
[43:33] 61 says desperations
[43:35] the signs of his coming should throw
[43:38] every member of christ into desperations
[43:41] now
[43:43] so the signs i know that we don't put
[43:46] emphasis on signs
[43:47] because it's the the work of the
[43:50] token in our lives is not a sign but
[43:53] it's a
[43:54] life it's a it's something that comes in
[43:57] it changes everything about you it
[44:00] changes your appetite it changes your
[44:02] desires it changes the way you look at
[44:04] things
[44:04] hey man so we're not concentrating so
[44:07] much
[44:08] on the science but we want to see what
[44:10] emphasis is being laid here
[44:12] so and to understand that as i'm in
[44:15] observance in an observation of these
[44:18] signs
[44:19] what it ought to do in my heart
[44:22] you know because like brother billy said
[44:24] the the faith
[44:26] it actually moves you it's not something
[44:28] that just sits there
[44:29] and then we place it on the shelf no a
[44:32] real revelation
[44:33] makes preparation for the fulfillment
[44:36] god when he begins to impart to us
[44:38] something that's divine
[44:40] he's waiting to see how we'll move and
[44:43] we'll continually go through different
[44:45] adversities
[44:46] until we recognize the value of heeding
[44:49] that call amen
[44:51] signs of his coming should throw every
[44:53] member of christ into desperations now
[44:56] about our soul about our welfare
[44:59] hereafter
[45:00] well what are we going to do if we
[45:03] amount
[45:06] what are we going to amount to if we
[45:10] gain the whole world
[45:13] what are we what are we living for
[45:17] what are we working for what are we
[45:20] eating for what are we struggling for
[45:24] to live what are we living for
[45:27] to die and you're not fit to live until
[45:30] you're fit to die
[45:32] it's true and so brother branham begins
[45:35] to speak a little bit about the
[45:37] different
[45:38] supernatural signs and wonders that
[45:41] were manifested in the ministry and how
[45:45] that this desperations when when this
[45:48] person had a cancer and was
[45:50] healed and it was a miraculous thing he
[45:54] says now
[45:55] desperations what about when
[45:59] your wife is about to die with the
[46:01] cancer
[46:02] he know that god could heal her and if
[46:05] god could heal his wife
[46:07] god could heal the boy and it through it
[46:10] throws
[46:11] it into a state of desperations you must
[46:14] come
[46:15] when you're desperate then god is going
[46:17] to listen to you
[46:19] but if you're just slothful and don't
[46:21] care whether you do
[46:22] or not well then that's different
[46:26] you say you do but it takes desperation
[46:30] to do it
[46:31] amen i believe the reason that we don't
[46:33] have desperation is because the lack
[46:36] of love god the love of god
[46:40] i think that the love of god causes
[46:43] desperation
[46:44] if god is in you the token inside of you
[46:48] and you see the conditions of time and
[46:51] the people waiting in sin the way they
[46:53] are
[46:54] it throws you into desperation i believe
[46:57] it will
[46:58] amen and we see the conditions of time
[47:01] and the people waiting in sin the way
[47:04] they are
[47:05] so we just want to just have maybe a
[47:07] little bit of a teaching
[47:08] a little bit of something that god
[47:10] placed on my heart that i've just been
[47:12] so
[47:12] moved and even hearing um you know the
[47:16] call of the spirit this morning
[47:18] it just the the focus that i want to
[47:21] drive
[47:21] to and it's based on this next statement
[47:24] as well it says now
[47:25] the the word plainly states if you want
[47:28] to put it down
[47:29] in galatians 5 and 6 that faith
[47:33] worketh by love see faith
[47:36] worketh by love the only way that you
[47:39] can have
[47:39] faith is to have love first because
[47:42] after all faith is love's incentive
[47:46] you see to understand it plainly
[47:48] sometimes you would have
[47:50] maybe uh a job and one of the
[47:54] one of the incentives that i had on one
[47:55] of my first jobs working for a
[47:57] restaurant they gave me a free meal
[47:58] for lunch okay that's just an incentive
[48:00] and then some
[48:01] other job you may have an incentive of
[48:03] free health care
[48:05] but now the the thing about the
[48:08] incentive of love is faith amen
[48:12] amen you have the ability to call on god
[48:16] and god deliver you and deposit you of
[48:19] revelation of his love towards you
[48:21] of his love that he wants to express
[48:23] through you amen
[48:25] so we just want to be calling for faith
[48:29] that's what we want to speak about
[48:31] tonight is calling for faith
[48:33] love's incentive amen that's just one we
[48:35] want to direct our thoughts towards
[48:38] is calling for faith amen he said at the
[48:41] end he said will i find
[48:42] faith in the earth amen this is
[48:45] a god who knows what he wants done in
[48:48] his people
[48:49] he wants to bring a faith that will
[48:51] cause a body change amen
[48:54] amen so you know one of the things that
[48:59] um i've been going through a few uh
[49:02] messages and and one of them was
[49:04] standing in the gap and then
[49:06] um it was something that was preached
[49:07] after the seals and
[49:09] and brother branham had uh spoke
[49:12] a message after that about the flashing
[49:15] red lights of his coming and
[49:17] i thought maybe we could just read a
[49:19] scripture and kind of take a little bit
[49:21] of what he taught in that and just
[49:24] see where the lord takes us tonight amen
[49:26] so we turn in the
[49:28] bible it's over there in
[49:33] matthew 24 matthew 24.
[49:45] we'll start there this is after
[49:49] the lord rebuked a bunch of the
[49:51] pharisees calling them the generations
[49:53] and vipers and different things and
[49:55] jesus
[49:56] in verse 1 he says and jesus went out
[49:59] and departed from the temple and his
[50:02] disciples
[50:03] came to him for to show him the
[50:06] buildings
[50:07] of the temple and jesus said unto them
[50:12] see not all these things verily i say
[50:14] unto you there
[50:15] shall not be left here one
[50:18] stone upon another that shall not be
[50:22] thrown down
[50:24] and as he said on the mount of olives
[50:27] the disciples came to him
[50:29] privately saying tell us when shall
[50:32] these things be
[50:34] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[50:36] and
[50:37] of the end of the world amen
[50:40] and so we just want to maybe focus in on
[50:43] a little bit of the questions that the
[50:45] disciples ask
[50:46] you see this wasn't those that were in
[50:48] the synagogue these were the disciples
[50:51] and so now this is a question and
[50:54] brother brennan made this statement in
[50:57] the flashing red lights of his coming he
[50:59] said that
[51:00] he said brethren i think we make a
[51:03] mistake trying to apply
[51:05] all of these to his coming amen
[51:09] so but he he said now he asked three
[51:12] questions
[51:13] what is the sign of the end of the world
[51:15] what is the sign of the
[51:17] of your coming and when will it come the
[51:19] time
[51:20] that there won't be left one stone upon
[51:24] the other on the temple and then he goes
[51:27] on and he says now
[51:29] if you go to verse 32 in the same
[51:34] chapter
[51:38] so now learn a parable of the fig tree
[51:41] when his branches is yet tender and
[51:44] putteth forth leaves
[51:46] you know the summer is nigh so likewise
[51:48] ye
[51:49] when you see all these things know
[51:53] that it is near even at the door verily
[51:56] i say unto you this
[51:57] generation shall not pass till all these
[52:00] things be fulfilled
[52:01] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[52:04] word
[52:05] shall not pass away but of the day
[52:08] and the hour no man no
[52:11] not the angels of heaven but my father
[52:14] only
[52:15] but but as the days of noah were
[52:20] so shall also the coming of the son of
[52:23] man be
[52:25] amen for for as in the days
[52:28] that were before the flood they were
[52:31] eating
[52:32] drinking marrying and giving in of
[52:33] marriage until the day that noah
[52:36] entered in the ark amen so brother
[52:39] branham makes
[52:42] gives us a understanding here that
[52:45] you know the lord spoke and answered
[52:48] those three questions
[52:50] and said now you need to go back
[52:54] as it was in the days of noah so if we
[52:57] could turn back
[52:58] and do like our lord said and go back to
[53:01] genesis
[53:02] chapter six and let's see if we can find
[53:04] some parallels
[53:06] between that day and this day
[53:09] because i believe we're at the end time
[53:25] so in genesis chapter 6
[53:29] in verse 1 he says and it came to pass
[53:33] when men began to multiply on the face
[53:36] of the earth
[53:37] and daughters were born from them so so
[53:41] we look at that in a parallel
[53:44] and never has there ever been a day
[53:47] where human beings are multiplying
[53:51] at a exceptional rate there's so many
[53:55] the population they're they're saying
[53:57] we're going to run out of food
[53:59] they're concerned in every hand for the
[54:02] the population about housing and
[54:04] different things
[54:05] so there is a a hand of god that's
[54:09] turning the clock back
[54:11] to match the same condition that it was
[54:14] then
[54:15] to now amen so god was going to speak
[54:18] these things then so that when we see it
[54:22] come to pass
[54:22] it can cause a desperation in our heart
[54:25] we say wait a minute
[54:27] there's people out there that are in
[54:29] these conditions
[54:30] and yet god's done something for us he's
[54:33] expressed his love
[54:34] he's brought us to himself he's given us
[54:37] a perfect word
[54:38] and now we can just see it so plain amen
[54:42] he said now they would multiply so fast
[54:47] he said the very first word presented to
[54:49] us
[54:50] is an absolute flashing red light on the
[54:52] hand
[54:53] for there was never been a time in all
[54:56] the history that has ever been that so
[54:58] many people
[54:59] so quickly multiply as it has today
[55:03] until it's hard enough to find a place
[55:05] to stay
[55:06] and so many people multiplying on the
[55:08] earth till science says
[55:10] if it continues to multiply like this 20
[55:12] years
[55:13] from now they won't have enough food on
[55:15] the earth for the people that was
[55:16] reader's digest i believe it was he
[55:18] quoted that
[55:19] and there there won't be enough food for
[55:21] the people amen
[55:23] and so he says
[55:26] we we can look around and see the places
[55:29] that they used to be wilderness and now
[55:31] they're turning into cities even in
[55:32] our area here you just there's hardly a
[55:35] place to build anything everything's
[55:37] getting built up and they're going out
[55:38] further and further
[55:40] amen he says now look around and
[55:44] and then yet the birth control and is is
[55:47] in the in his greatest rampage
[55:49] and and speaking about the
[55:53] you know the different aborigines cases
[55:55] and how
[55:56] there's so many but yet there's still
[55:59] millions
[56:00] and millions of people even though
[56:02] they're trying to do population control
[56:04] and things like that
[56:05] it's just never been this populated and
[56:08] and yet he's saying now it's pattern as
[56:11] it was
[56:12] in the days of noah amen
[56:18] and even even then brother brown's
[56:21] saying
[56:22] like in india how they were trying to
[56:23] make the humans try to interrupt their
[56:26] human
[56:26] ability to have children and even in
[56:29] china how they've restricted things
[56:31] you know even even that they still can't
[56:34] do it because of the prophecy
[56:36] amen
[56:41] so he says now
[56:46] in verse 2 he says that the sons of god
[56:50] saw the daughters of men that they were
[56:52] fair
[56:54] and they took them wives all
[56:58] which they choose it's interesting
[57:02] there's a number of things that just
[57:03] began to pop out there
[57:05] for for one it was the sons of god of
[57:07] things that they chose
[57:09] never mind what god's choice was
[57:12] amen and you see the the hour in which
[57:16] we
[57:16] live in man has totally come to a
[57:19] disregard to what god thinks or god says
[57:22] amen they say well the sons of god now
[57:26] that's
[57:27] the tremendous thing that's standing out
[57:30] how that
[57:31] sons of god these were the the lineage
[57:34] of seth
[57:35] now they're starting to look at those
[57:37] came the
[57:38] cain's lineage and now they begin to
[57:41] intermingle
[57:42] so now sons of god because of beauty
[57:45] because they had become so beautiful
[57:48] that they
[57:49] started falling for human flesh
[57:53] amen that's what happens when the
[57:55] population increases
[57:57] and and and and they just begin to
[58:00] multiply
[58:01] amen but now brother brandon was talking
[58:05] in in the 50s and 60s he says there
[58:08] would be one here or one there
[58:10] they would call them like the queens of
[58:11] the city but it was so rare
[58:13] but now what has happened the hand of
[58:16] prophecy has turned
[58:17] and now there's hardly a woman that
[58:20] doesn't have this
[58:21] beauty and it's caused the sons of god
[58:24] to fall
[58:30] and now the scripture says
[58:33] in verse 3 he says the lord said my
[58:36] spirit shall not always strive with man
[58:38] for that he also is flesh
[58:43] and yet his days shall be in hundred
[58:47] in 20 years amen
[58:54] he says oh what a subject here now one
[58:57] of the things that i want you to notice
[58:59] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[59:00] of man that they were fair
[59:02] i don't i'm pointing to this to the
[59:05] whole world
[59:06] but there's never been a time on the
[59:08] earth as i can think of it
[59:10] only that time that there was such a
[59:12] wholesale
[59:13] beauty among women and you can't
[59:16] you can't remember some of the elderly
[59:19] women some of the people
[59:20] men you can remember back years ago how
[59:22] that seldom
[59:23] you found a pretty woman but today you
[59:26] don't find
[59:27] any but what is pretty
[59:30] is because that they have come to a
[59:33] place where they're bobbing their hair
[59:34] makeup and the kinds of sexy clothes and
[59:37] things
[59:38] and they present themselves in that way
[59:40] and then
[59:41] it's another thing the hand of time has
[59:44] turned it back according to the
[59:45] scripture
[59:46] and the women are constantly on the
[59:48] increase of being pretty
[59:50] amen it's another sign of his coming
[59:53] another sign that we're at the end
[59:56] i can remember when i was a little boy
[59:58] in school and i turned and looked
[1:00:00] at the children today and the girls
[1:00:02] coming on i can look and look at the
[1:00:04] women the young women the pretty
[1:00:06] the girls and remember that one popular
[1:00:10] girl
[1:00:11] and and then not be 25 years old but
[1:00:14] one popular girl pretty girl and nearly
[1:00:17] a boy wanted to go
[1:00:19] near every boy wanted to go with this
[1:00:21] girl
[1:00:22] but she was the queen of the group
[1:00:25] making the whole city and two or three
[1:00:27] women
[1:00:28] but now the whole thing becomes pretty
[1:00:33] all of them and what is it the scripture
[1:00:36] it's a red light flashing the time is at
[1:00:39] hand
[1:00:40] and they've invented lipstick and makeup
[1:00:43] the women that isn't so fair they can
[1:00:46] still make themselves pretty
[1:00:47] with all these face lifts and things
[1:00:50] they make themselves pretty amen so we
[1:00:52] know
[1:00:52] that they have spent more money on the
[1:00:55] cosmetics than they do the food
[1:00:58] amen so so we see where we're living at
[1:01:01] we see that this is the fulfillment this
[1:01:03] should cause
[1:01:04] something within us to start causing us
[1:01:07] to have a desperation to recognize
[1:01:10] that god has called us to a certain
[1:01:13] position
[1:01:14] in christ amen
[1:01:24] so he says in verse 4 he says and there
[1:01:27] were giants in the land
[1:01:28] in those days and after that when the
[1:01:31] sons of god
[1:01:33] came into the daughters of men and they
[1:01:35] bore them children
[1:01:37] unto them and the same became mighty men
[1:01:40] which were of old men of renowned amen
[1:01:43] they
[1:01:43] they become politicians they become
[1:01:46] great orators of speech
[1:01:48] amen smart people
[1:01:53] and god saw the wickedness of men that
[1:01:56] was great in the earth
[1:01:58] and that every imagination of their
[1:02:00] thoughts
[1:02:01] in their heart were continually evil
[1:02:04] amen they always had their minds
[1:02:07] on that corrupt thing it's just such a
[1:02:11] perversion of what god wanted
[1:02:14] amen and you see now because of this
[1:02:17] curse of sin that veil
[1:02:20] has now become an unholy veil and so
[1:02:23] much so that
[1:02:25] because of the beauty and because of the
[1:02:28] positioning
[1:02:29] of fashion and things like that it has
[1:02:31] made to where
[1:02:34] it's it's so perverted and the
[1:02:38] it's become so cheap that now they've
[1:02:41] been turned over to a vowel affection
[1:02:43] where man actually it's like it was in
[1:02:46] the days of lot
[1:02:48] you know it's like when the messenger
[1:02:50] came
[1:02:51] to deliver and
[1:02:54] lot was there he offered his two virgin
[1:02:57] daughters
[1:02:58] and yet they refused that they wanted
[1:03:02] it was that spirit of sodomy
[1:03:05] amen so we see that we're living in a
[1:03:07] time
[1:03:08] where this condition has come to pass
[1:03:12] again
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:23] praise the lord everybody feeling good
[1:03:26] happy to be a christian amen
[1:03:30] you know god god's love has an incentive
[1:03:34] to make where we're at in time so plain
[1:03:37] that we can take courage that we can
[1:03:40] step into our
[1:03:42] position and no you know what it's not
[1:03:45] about my failures
[1:03:47] it's not about what i think i am
[1:03:50] but it's about what he said i am
[1:03:54] lord let it be according to your word in
[1:03:57] my life amen
[1:03:59] you know these these sons of god they
[1:04:02] begin to take these women of their own
[1:04:05] choosing
[1:04:06] never mind the the word of god
[1:04:10] it says thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:04:13] even if you look it upon a woman with
[1:04:16] lust in your heart
[1:04:17] you know those things because man
[1:04:21] they they look at that and they mock the
[1:04:23] word of god and they say
[1:04:24] well i can do this and i can do that
[1:04:27] because
[1:04:28] you know i'm getting away with it but
[1:04:30] there
[1:04:31] is a there is a judgment that's coming
[1:04:36] and so just because someone seems to
[1:04:38] kind of temporarily
[1:04:40] be getting away with it doesn't mean
[1:04:42] that
[1:04:44] god's not holy and just
[1:04:47] to recompense a reward for those things
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:55] you know the the the thing that
[1:04:58] you know the token is is something that
[1:05:02] you know it's a confirmation of a
[1:05:05] payment that was received
[1:05:07] you know whenever god gives you the seal
[1:05:09] of promise
[1:05:12] it's because he's accepted your
[1:05:14] sacrifice amen
[1:05:16] and so now there is a there is
[1:05:19] you know there's witnesses in the world
[1:05:21] that will testify
[1:05:23] that you know i'm getting away with it
[1:05:26] but then there's another people that are
[1:05:27] witnessing and have a confirmation of
[1:05:30] peace
[1:05:31] that i pass from death to life i was
[1:05:33] once that person
[1:05:35] i was once mocking god ridiculing saying
[1:05:38] yeah
[1:05:39] you know i'm just like that because i
[1:05:40] was of the world but yet one day
[1:05:44] one day it was an ordained time in
[1:05:46] season
[1:05:48] god saw fit to reveal his son in me
[1:05:52] amen that's that's what a hope of our
[1:05:53] calling is it's christ in you
[1:05:56] christ in me amen
[1:06:02] praise the lord
[1:06:08] you know the token is a guarantee it's a
[1:06:11] seal
[1:06:12] it's a security and the token actually
[1:06:16] speaks for you you know when god plays a
[1:06:19] gift of faith in our lives
[1:06:21] you know that will witness to the
[1:06:24] unbeliever
[1:06:25] that'll witness to our loved ones
[1:06:27] that'll witness
[1:06:28] and so we don't have to work it up you
[1:06:31] know
[1:06:31] we're called to just walk by faith amen
[1:06:37] we were the guilty ones that have
[1:06:39] accepted god's provision
[1:06:42] and now the results of that pardon is
[1:06:44] being expressed
[1:06:45] by a life of holiness a life that
[1:06:48] reverences god
[1:06:50] amen that's that's the the thing that
[1:06:53] will be effectual working for those
[1:06:55] that are loved ones you know when they
[1:06:58] see you
[1:06:58] they say well
[1:07:02] this this uh seal is what
[1:07:05] pleased god and and you're different why
[1:07:09] why i want that amen so
[1:07:12] we're we're witnesses and and there's a
[1:07:15] signification you know the scripture
[1:07:17] says
[1:07:17] in um i believe it's in uh
[1:07:21] first corinthians 14.
[1:07:25] you just read it
[1:07:44] in verse 6 it says
[1:07:48] now brethren if there come unto you
[1:07:50] speaking with tongues
[1:07:52] what shall i profit you except i
[1:07:55] shall speak to you either by revelation
[1:07:57] or by knowledge
[1:07:59] or by prophecy or by doctrine
[1:08:03] and even things without life giving
[1:08:06] sound
[1:08:07] whether harp whether pipe or harp except
[1:08:11] it give a distinction
[1:08:13] in the sound how shall it be known
[1:08:17] what is piped or heart for if the
[1:08:20] trumpet
[1:08:21] give an uncertain sound how shall
[1:08:25] who shall prepare himself for battle
[1:08:29] so likewise ye except ye utter by the
[1:08:32] tongue
[1:08:32] words easy to understand
[1:08:36] how shall it be known what is spoken
[1:08:40] for ye shall speak into the air
[1:08:43] and there are it may be as many kinds of
[1:08:47] voices in the world
[1:08:48] and none them is without signification
[1:08:52] amen there's the the voices there's so
[1:08:55] many voices in the world today
[1:08:56] and none of them are without
[1:08:58] significance there's there's people that
[1:09:00] they believe it's a reality
[1:09:02] of what they're doing
[1:09:05] but there is a true witness amen that
[1:09:08] gives
[1:09:09] a true seal a true sign that will cause
[1:09:12] other people to understand that
[1:09:16] there is a preparation to be made
[1:09:17] there's a tribulation to avoid
[1:09:20] amen and we definitely want to just trim
[1:09:24] our lamps ask the lord you know
[1:09:28] let that revelation come that'll cause a
[1:09:31] desperation in me
[1:09:32] amen you know we see the the signs that
[1:09:36] you know the uh the bunch that
[1:09:40] you know were with abraham where he
[1:09:42] turned his back to the audience we saw
[1:09:43] that sign that
[1:09:44] the messiah sign and you know that's
[1:09:47] that's one of the
[1:09:48] the things that we've embraced and know
[1:09:51] and
[1:09:52] just feel there was certainly something
[1:09:55] that
[1:09:56] you know brother branham made emphasis
[1:09:58] about the flashing red light of his
[1:09:59] coming
[1:10:00] knowing that you know when you saw this
[1:10:04] increase in beauty and
[1:10:06] you know the world's population growing
[1:10:08] and
[1:10:09] the whole disregard for god's word that
[1:10:12] that was going to be the time were the
[1:10:15] son of man
[1:10:16] the coming of the son of man and so in
[1:10:19] this coming
[1:10:20] there was going to be a restoration and
[1:10:22] so
[1:10:23] one of the things that i thank god for
[1:10:25] is the restoration of that holy veil
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] when i'm living in the midst of all this
[1:10:29] condition amen i need an inward strength
[1:10:32] amen because i used to be in prison to
[1:10:34] that same spirit that the world
[1:10:36] they're at the altar of some woman some
[1:10:39] female flesh
[1:10:40] you see that's the bondage that man had
[1:10:43] gotten
[1:10:44] into when they forsake the word of god
[1:10:46] amen but god's come and
[1:10:48] in his mercy he's restored
[1:10:51] the token amen and the
[1:10:55] the the token is the holy spirit
[1:10:58] amen so if you receive the holy spirit
[1:11:01] it'll make you holy
[1:11:02] amen because it's not you but it's the
[1:11:04] holy spirit in you
[1:11:05] amen so when you're walking and you see
[1:11:08] the world groping in this kind of
[1:11:09] condition
[1:11:10] then it causes you to turn your head
[1:11:12] amen it causes you to help your brother
[1:11:14] and say
[1:11:15] you know what there's a better way amen
[1:11:20] you don't have to be a slave to your
[1:11:22] fallen humanity there's
[1:11:26] there's a provision made that you you
[1:11:28] can be born again
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:37] yeah i take courage you know whenever
[1:11:42] brother brown spoke about that learn the
[1:11:44] parable of the fig tree and the fig tree
[1:11:46] is always
[1:11:47] israel you know and they became their
[1:11:50] own nation
[1:11:51] they got their own money their own
[1:11:53] military and it was
[1:11:55] uh the the day that they became a state
[1:11:58] is actually a day when the angel lord
[1:12:00] came to brother branham and spoke to him
[1:12:01] about a specific message
[1:12:03] and i just think about that the
[1:12:06] connection
[1:12:07] that you know so shall it be in the
[1:12:10] the coming of the son of man you know
[1:12:13] the the scriptures
[1:12:14] are being made manifest right before our
[1:12:17] eyes
[1:12:17] it should cause a desperation in our
[1:12:20] heart to take our position
[1:12:22] in christ we are the ambassadors
[1:12:25] of this great message we are the fruit
[1:12:27] of what he
[1:12:28] spoke amen we are the ones to take
[1:12:31] and be the witnesses we are the actual
[1:12:35] fruit of the tree that has been restored
[1:12:39] and that same fellowship you know
[1:12:43] amen it's so wonderful
[1:12:54] amen the the same works
[1:12:58] that he did he wants to do in us
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:12] you know and how can we do the same
[1:13:13] works that he did
[1:13:17] well we need a revelation because we
[1:13:20] were guilty
[1:13:21] we crossed all of god's laws
[1:13:25] and we couldn't we couldn't get
[1:13:27] ourselves out we couldn't lift up our
[1:13:28] own bootstraps
[1:13:30] and cross that chasm
[1:13:35] but that that lamb that was without
[1:13:38] blemish
[1:13:39] without spot he came to us
[1:13:43] amen and and it's so important
[1:13:46] i just remember i could just go back to
[1:13:50] the day
[1:13:50] and the hour i just remember when i was
[1:13:53] listening
[1:13:54] brother branham said you must place your
[1:13:56] hands
[1:13:57] upon your sacrifice and
[1:14:00] and somehow some way you can go
[1:14:04] to that place where you're at calvary
[1:14:07] and you
[1:14:08] lay your hands on your sacrifice that
[1:14:10] bleeding
[1:14:12] bloody lamb is being sacrificed even
[1:14:15] fresh today
[1:14:17] you could go and place your hands and
[1:14:20] i found myself dying
[1:14:23] on the same altar with my sacrifice
[1:14:26] amen that's what it must that's what
[1:14:29] must take place
[1:14:30] in order for this token to be displayed
[1:14:34] because it's not look at me
[1:14:37] i have uh the holy ghost no
[1:14:41] no he has he has arrested me
[1:14:44] i've become his prisoner amen he's now
[1:14:46] possessed
[1:14:47] me amen and so i found myself on that
[1:14:51] altar
[1:14:53] amen that's what you find yourself on
[1:14:55] when you are at a place where you can't
[1:14:57] make a way for yourself when the bills
[1:15:00] and you've worked all you could
[1:15:02] or when you're coming to a place where
[1:15:05] they gave you the diagnosis and you find
[1:15:07] yourself
[1:15:08] lord i can't do it amen but that token's
[1:15:11] there
[1:15:12] and we call upon it amen
[1:15:19] praise the lord
[1:15:41] just find a place that we can
[1:15:44] make a little turn here and you say we
[1:15:48] won't be long tonight
[1:16:01] it says this in the token
[1:16:05] brother braham says i wonder today when
[1:16:07] god leads us
[1:16:09] to a life of complete surrender and
[1:16:11] service to him
[1:16:13] i wonder if our spirit then sometimes
[1:16:16] don't rebel and kind of show that
[1:16:19] i wonder if we are lambs
[1:16:23] the lamb is obedient amen a lamb is
[1:16:27] self-sacrificial
[1:16:28] it doesn't take it don't take or claim
[1:16:31] its own
[1:16:33] can lay right down and shear off
[1:16:36] shear it off that's the only way it's
[1:16:38] got
[1:16:39] you never say anything about it just
[1:16:42] sacrifices
[1:16:43] everything that's a lamb it gives
[1:16:46] everything
[1:16:46] to it it gives everything away
[1:16:54] and that's the way a real christian is
[1:16:57] a self-sacrifice themselves not caring
[1:17:00] for
[1:17:01] things of the world but giving all they
[1:17:04] got
[1:17:05] to god amen and now this was the perfect
[1:17:09] lamb
[1:17:09] christ was and then there was
[1:17:12] the shed of this lamb the natural
[1:17:16] land in egypt the blood had to be
[1:17:18] applied and it stood for the token
[1:17:20] then it would be the blood of this lamb
[1:17:24] stood for see the token
[1:17:29] that we're dead to ourselves and
[1:17:31] identified with our sacrifice
[1:17:33] then the lamb and the blood
[1:17:38] the person becomes identified together
[1:17:40] the sacrifice and the believer
[1:17:42] see you're identified in your life by
[1:17:46] your sacrifice
[1:17:47] and that makes you what you are amen
[1:17:51] you know it's it's one of those things
[1:17:53] that
[1:17:54] you say it's a saying that we have it
[1:17:57] says
[1:17:58] you know
[1:18:01] don't look at yourself look at your
[1:18:03] sacrifice
[1:18:05] it's so easy to look at what we were
[1:18:09] by actions and things
[1:18:13] but when we look at him and we see our
[1:18:16] example
[1:18:18] you know he he proved what life really
[1:18:20] was like
[1:18:21] you know jesus christ never lived one
[1:18:23] day for himself
[1:18:24] he lived it for others and as the
[1:18:26] scripture says
[1:18:27] if you say you love god and you hate
[1:18:29] your brother you're a liar amen
[1:18:31] and so i say lord god i need you i need
[1:18:34] to call on you now
[1:18:36] for that divine love i realize there's
[1:18:38] things lacking in me
[1:18:39] i can see i can see people going that
[1:18:43] way
[1:18:44] and i won't even say nothing to stop
[1:18:47] them
[1:18:48] say wait a minute lord put something in
[1:18:51] me
[1:18:52] a real love a desperation
[1:18:55] to go out to those souls that are
[1:18:57] hurting i know it's so
[1:18:58] easy you just get caught up on the nine
[1:19:01] to five
[1:19:02] but listen my brother and my sister
[1:19:06] i realize there's a lot of things going
[1:19:08] on but
[1:19:09] they have the world partially shut down
[1:19:12] right now
[1:19:13] and and things just seem like maybe
[1:19:16] they'll correct themselves
[1:19:17] but i just believe we're the the world
[1:19:20] is going to continue to get
[1:19:22] worse and worse and worse it's time that
[1:19:25] we
[1:19:26] rise in the power of god's love and the
[1:19:28] holy ghost
[1:19:29] and let the love of god be expressed
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:33] amen praise the lord
[1:19:41] maybe if we'll just stand and just
[1:19:44] invite the musicians
[1:19:56] the very things that god did for you
[1:19:59] he wants to express that same fruit
[1:20:02] to others amen
[1:20:10] in romans chapter 13
[1:20:14] and verse 8 it says o man
[1:20:17] and anything o no man anything
[1:20:21] but to love one another
[1:20:24] for he that loveth another fulfilleth
[1:20:27] the law
[1:20:28] for this thou shall not commit adultery
[1:20:30] thou shalt not kill
[1:20:32] thou shall not steal thou shalt not bear
[1:20:34] false witness
[1:20:35] thou shall not covet and if there be any
[1:20:38] other commandment
[1:20:39] it is barely comprehended in this saying
[1:20:42] namely
[1:20:43] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:20:47] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[1:20:51] therefore love is fulfilled in all the
[1:20:53] law
[1:20:54] and that knowing the time that now
[1:20:58] is high time to wake out of
[1:21:01] sleep for now is our salvation nearer
[1:21:04] than
[1:21:05] when we believed the night is far spent
[1:21:08] and the day is at hand
[1:21:10] let us therefore cast off the works of
[1:21:12] darkness
[1:21:13] and let us put on the armor of light let
[1:21:16] us walk honestly as in the day
[1:21:18] not in rioting and drunkenness not in
[1:21:21] chambering
[1:21:22] or wanting not in strife or envy
[1:21:26] put but put ye on christ
[1:21:29] jesus put on the lord jesus christ and
[1:21:32] make no provision
[1:21:34] for the flesh to fulfill the lust
[1:21:35] thereof amen i just believe that there's
[1:21:38] a great admonition
[1:21:39] in knowing the signs and the conditions
[1:21:42] the time how it's turned back
[1:21:44] and we see all of the great mysteries
[1:21:47] that have been revealed
[1:21:49] and we see how god has walked us through
[1:21:51] the church ages and seen the horse
[1:21:53] riders run and we've seen the seals
[1:21:56] and the unfolding of how things are
[1:21:58] going to transpire at the end
[1:22:01] but let us wake up and shake ourselves
[1:22:04] and rise to this great calling and say
[1:22:07] god crown me with the love divine
[1:22:10] let this desperation awaken in me
[1:22:13] that i can fulfill the hope of glory
[1:22:16] and that's christ in you amen
[1:22:19] you feel in your heart you want to join
[1:22:21] me in prayer and say god lord
[1:22:23] let this love that you spoke about
[1:22:27] that would cause a desperation to see
[1:22:29] souls to see the condition that we're
[1:22:32] in what it ought to do for us
[1:22:37] why don't we bow our hearts together
[1:22:40] precious lord jesus lord what a
[1:22:44] what a sovereign hour lord that you've
[1:22:46] called us to here at the end
[1:22:49] father to to call us
[1:22:52] lord we were in darkness father and we
[1:22:56] were
[1:22:57] seeking our own way but yet you and your
[1:23:00] infinite wisdom and your mercy and your
[1:23:03] desire to have a family
[1:23:04] lord you've wooed us with your love and
[1:23:07] lord we received that
[1:23:09] expression of calvary lord and now we
[1:23:12] want to
[1:23:12] oh god go to the battlefront lord with
[1:23:15] the same love
[1:23:16] lord we just we're just asking tonight
[1:23:19] that you would do for us lord
[1:23:21] we're we're placing the token before us
[1:23:25] lord
[1:23:26] desiring that the divine love that you
[1:23:28] promised you would cap this bride with
[1:23:31] lord would so compel us lord it would
[1:23:34] cause such a
[1:23:34] desperation in us lord it would drive us
[1:23:38] to our knees in prayer lord when we feel
[1:23:40] offended by our brother or when we
[1:23:43] have done wrong lord let it oh god give
[1:23:45] us courage
[1:23:46] to humble ourselves before our brother
[1:23:49] lord we're asking lord that
[1:23:52] situations and personal needs lord that
[1:23:56] are upon the people's hearts they're
[1:23:58] here and and over the stream lord we
[1:24:01] just
[1:24:02] we're just gonna ask and commit it all
[1:24:04] to you lord believing
[1:24:06] that you're a rewarder of those who
[1:24:09] diligently seek you lord so we just
[1:24:12] place our cares into your hands praying
