Description:
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: February 13, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

certainly want to welcome everyone in the house of god it's good to see brother gary sister barbara god bless you as invited by mike this morning for our songwriting god bless you amen if you guys want to have a seat where brother david asked me to give you an update on the church uh construction project we'll just have a quick update there and then we'll go ahead and get right into the psalm as many of you know we've been embarked on a project for a number of years now to try to build a new facility next door here to accommodate more people to accommodate sunday school once again to provide a fellowship hall if possible and you know just we have a lot of needs and you know our goal is to try to build another building that look that'll accommodate that so it turns out there's a lot of work involved in doing that with the city and satisfying their requirements the requirements of the the neighbors around us to give you a quick update we've spent the last the better part of the last year working with the city working with a civil engineer to complete a design of what our property is going to look like it's called a civil plan and there's a lot of back and forth that goes on between the engineer between us between the city there's a lot of things the city is trying to figure out you know what does the drainage need to look like and you know some of their records have been out of date and you know there's there's updated ordinances in terms of what you need to do to support fire lanes and and to be able to accommodate fire trucks on the property and all of that you know takes time and so we've been going back and forth i think six different times we went back and forth over the course the last year as brother david announced on december 30th we did get the approval for our civil plan finally and so that kind of led us to being able to move forward with the next step which is really kind of two-fold you know the first thing we needed to do was get what's called a completed plat and what a plat is is it's basically a document a legal document and a design that that kind of records officially what your property is going to look like with that civil plan and i don't know if you know but the the property that we sit on with this existing building the property next door those have been two different pieces of property this property was owned to be used as a church that property next door was zoned really residential the intent was when the property was first you know titled that it was going to be zoned and used for residential so we had to get a special use permit with the city to be able to let us use that for parking to be able to let us use that for church activities that permit was getting close to expiring so this week we went to for the city asking for an extension of that permit which they approved uh which we're grateful for uh we also submitted to them a plat request which basically details what we're proposing that the combined property will be in terms of zoning it all as special use where all the easements are going to be where um you know what that design was going to look like they treat all this as a development we submitted a request for that this week and they also approved that so officially we'll be recording this as a combined property over the course of the next couple weeks our request for the special use permit now that the planning and zoning committee has approved that that's going to go ahead and go before the city council on march 8th so if you want to go ahead and keep that in prayer we were very fortunate this past week that we got no objections it was a unanimous approval we're going to get the unanimous recommendation of the planning and zoning committee so our prayer is is that on the 8th will at least get the special use permit approved so that for another year what that basically means is when you have a special use permit you have about a year to get a building permit in place and get started on your project and so we don't think it'll take that long but at least we'll have our bases covered in terms of of having the right permitting for that the next step is is we need to work with the um with the public works department to go ahead and create entrances to our parking lots our future parking lots from the street there's some grading work that has to be done that the city is requiring of us there's some initial drainage work that has to be done and of course utilities work which means we're going to have to you know we're going to have to get those make use of those easements to get utilities in place and you know there'll be a period of time we'll have to block off the street and that type of thing uh we're in the process of working with a series of contractors brother david's helping us with that to to go to the uh to get to the city and get permits to get those done it's uh in fact i already got a call from the city building manager that wants to set up a pre-construction meeting to start looking at that so focus well you'll start to see some work with the street and with the parking lot and grading on the property and whatnot i would say within the next few weeks that's our that's our hope and that's our prayer so wanted to share that with you that you would you would keep that in prayer once we satisfy the public works pieces of the property then we'll be in a position where we can ask the city for a building permit so that's kind of where we sit i wanted to share that with you brother david felt it was important that you guys got an update on the status of our project and we're nearing a point where you're going to begin to see some visible effects of all the the hard work so be keeping that in prayer and and that the lord will lead us you know as trustees leave brother david as a pastor uh to to do the right things and to spend money wisely and to to make sure that the needs of the church are met so hopefully that gives everyone an update there that certainly i'm welcomed i'm happy to answer any questions after service if you or any one of the trustees brother david feel free to come up to us and ask us we're happy to share whatever gory details you're interested in turns out it's a very uh very exhausting and very mind-numbing business but for those of you that are interested in such things we're happy to share more information with that if you guys would mind standing we'll go ahead and look at our psalm this morning i'm going to turn to psalm 43. just a very short psalm this morning you know the thing that sort of stuck out to me as i was reading that you know david asks say um he asks an important question in psalm 43. he kind of sets that up starting in verse one he says judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man for thou art the god of my strength why does thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy that's the question why go i'm mourning because of the oppression of the enemy it's a good question i think maybe to pause and ask ourselves you know david speaks of having a cause that is at odds with an ungodly nation you know he felt he found himself living in a place in a time when everyone around him the world around him was ungodly not like god that's what ungodly means not like god you know having attributes that are not god's attributes and he found himself living in a place where all around him were things not like god and i think that probably sounds familiar to most of us here in this room we know a little bit about what it's like to dwell in a time in a place in an age when everything around us all the messages all the attributes all the the campaigns and the causes and the things that are being said are all not like god you know what's interesting is this isn't about human agendas you know the world would i guess have you think that the struggle that we're in is against good and evil against what's a good cause and a bad cause against different ideologies against political parties whatever the case may be at the end of the day it's all ungodly none of it is like god you know david had a cause his was at odds with all that was not like god that means the attributes the characteristics the the the person the the the the character that he that was his cause was incompatible with what was around him you know it's first john has a familiar scripture it's first john chapter 2 verse 15 it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and this verse stuck out to me for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh what feels right the lust of the eyes what looks right and the pride of life sounds right is not of the father ungodly but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust everything that seems right thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever you know if he is your cause there truly will be a conflict between you and everything that is around you you know the conflict is between what's like god and what's not like god and there's constant pressure between the two and the thing is is you can't fake this sooner or later one will push out the other they're totally incompatible what is like god and what is not like god that's the pressure that's the oppression you know when david asks the question why go i mourning because of the oppression the pressure of the enemy you know that word mourning that's not the same as the hebrew word that you would use for example if you had the loss of a loved one and you went to mourn the death of someone or had a had a major loss in your family that's not the kind of mourning that this word is talking about this kind of morning is the hebrew word it's only used four times in the entire bible this particular hebrew word means to be troubled to be upset to be frustrated or stirred up not because you've lost something but because you're overwhelmed by the pressure every single time it's used it's about it's in results to being pressed from something externally why go i'm mourning because of the impression of the enemy why do i get upset why do i get stirred up why do i get frustrated why do i get why do i get trouble because of the pressure of the enemy you know it literally means to become ash covered or look like you're in mourning mourning not because of defeat but because of pressure of what is not like god you know and i think that that's an important question to ask ourselves we've all done it where we're surrounded by the pressure of the ungodly and we get frustrated and we get troubled and we get burdened and we moan and complain but david asks an important question here why go we mourning because of the oppression of the enemy i think that's an important reminder because there's an interesting statement that he makes what it is that jesus said it just dawned on me let not your hearts be troubled you believe in god believe also in me but david has an interesting answer to his own question here in this chapter verse 3 oh send out thy light and truth your word let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill now notice what it says let them lead me you know it's really about what's leading you if the pressure of the ungodly causes you to respond with frustration and with trouble with a troubled manner and with moaning you're allowing that to lead you you're being influenced by that but david is let thy word lead me we have a different cause and to me this was an important reminder not to allow that pressure of what is ungodly to cause me to react in a way that would cause me to be led by that rather than his word because it says here that if you you know what that word does in verse 3 and 4 brings me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles then will i go to the altar of my god that brings you back to the cause it brings you back to the place where he can be glorified whereas it says in first john he doeth he that doeth the will of god you know and as i was reading this short little song this morning to me it was just an important reminder not to let myself become troubled or frustrated or disturbed by the ungodly pressure that which is not like god but the reminder to allow his word to bring me back to the cause which is that he would be glorified in this final hour it's so important to pay attention to what is leading you what is influencing you and if the pressure of the ungodly is influencing us it's causing us to behave in a way that is led by the pressure rather than by the word so to me this short little psalm was just a an important reminder to not let the oppression of the enemy cause you to mourn let's just read that together five little verses starting in verse one judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man for thou art the god of my strength why does thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy oh send out thy light in thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god amen amen god bless you may have your seats man let's sing that song count your blessings name them one by one oh

and grace for a grieving family castanada juan castinada passed away due to a heart attack and then also unspoken requests from brother tawanda wants to be remembered this morning and i certainly want to pray also i know what matthew is out ministering we want to pray for him so brother jackson is going to come out and give an update on the seating and pray for the request and then we'll uh the brothers that are taking the offerings he can come up to take the offerings amen i'm gonna make an announcement uh real quick um as you know when we do the youth services they just seem to generate a lot more visitors even than when we um have our normal meetings so we're gonna have probably about 60 young people here and then with that you have about 20 drivers and chaperones so you're looking at about 80 people then we have 40 of our own young people so we're at a 120 and then all the local helpers and the people assisting and people that are are housing people when we have a meeting like this we try to take in consideration all of those things so we really try to save the seating and sanctuary for those people that have been involved the whole weekend so just with that just don't be surprised be flexible it's one of those things where when you talk to the young people there there's really no other youth services where where a church is able to host all the young people and actually roll out the red carpet and all the expenses are paid so people enjoy coming here and with that that's why we try to save the sanctuary so when it's all said and done we normally have about 10 rows on this side and 10 rows on that side so you're left with maybe five full rows that are first come first serve so please just be sensitive that when you come next weekend on saturday especially sunday morning we already pack it out ourselves and then if you add 10 more rows on each sides of visitors it's really going to be busy so just know where we've set in the foyer we've set in the overflow and then sometimes we just get to a spot where we physically don't have a chair to put out so we'll have people sit in their cars and things like that so just be mindful of that but it is going to be a good time and then even his brother billy went over the prayer request you know as a as a young christian i used to think well god could just allow all of us to just never have an ailment never have a sickness never have a death never have a broken bone and you and you see these prayer requests that come out we know they're serious once amongst our mints but he says in his word he's giving us character and he's allowing these things to start to mold us and shape it and as time would uh i reflected back on a few pictures uh when i first started serving lord as time would start to tell the story you see that god is using all these events every sickness every prayer request everything to mold and shape his people and he has a purpose and we have confidence in his word and we would think maybe sometime with the snap of a finger we could just be delivered from these things but there's a reason why and then i believe when we're grounded in the word we're grounded the message he shows us this thing so if you guys would we just all stand i want to take these needs for the lord just let's pray together heavenly father we come to you right now lord brother billy went through a list of prayer requests and things that were mentioned lord and not just things that people would pin down lord but there are things that are serious lord there's ones that have passed away there's ones with cancers there's ones with broken bones there's ones that that even on the on the what we would say the positive side there's ones with new new life has come forth as one would pass away one would bring a new baby in lord and we see these sicknesses and we know that we could have a miracle lord you could use an instant miracle we've had that in our mid story we've had that amongst our brethren lord but we also know that sometimes you allow us to go through things you've never been blindsided or even as the enemy would come and he would put pain and pressure and he would put discomfort and he would allow things to happen in our life lord you were never blindsided you saw these things lord from the beginning to the end lord and you'll always see us through each one could come behind this pulpit now and testify of the things that you've done lord from an answered prayer request lord listening to a song to healing or even as brother dylan said within this hospital room lord you came and you were mindful here lord and we thank you for all those things lord and we just lift up your name on high lord we know that you love us we know that you allow circumstances we never want to forget that lord we lean on the brethren we lean on the ministry we lean on the tapes lord we lean on music father because we know that you can heal through all those things lord even today as brother david would come in what would be on his heart lord i pray that you would just speak to him lord he labors and he wants to he wants to be able to find where to lead the church as a true shepherd would lord in this sheep may we just be fed this morning the magical thing lord about your holy spirit is each person can have a need there can be 300 people here lord and you can walk down the aisle of each one and your word can discern the thoughts and intents of the heart you know what we have need of lord we're just committing this service into your hand lord we ask lord even now that you would just speak to the needs or people came in some broken lord some having thoughts of loved ones that aren't here that should be here some that lord have wayward children all the things lord even ones that have just passed away and people traveling to funerals lord we ask that you would just orchestrate each person's life lord and the events that take place we commit all things into your hands we ask these things in jesus name amen oh lord my god [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] god [Music] lord your greatness is so magnificent [Music] lord how it must have been for you and those of lesser authority absurd authority over you and how that you humbled yourself you bore the stripes and the nails father for our sake and you did it for us lord jesus because your love was so mighty and so great you could have called the angels but yet you so willingly took the crown of thorns [Music] father may we become like you [Music] may you grant us that sweetness of spirit father may we be meek like lambs but lord wise in the ways that the world affects us we asked this morning that your word would minister to the people this morning father we ask that your this sunday school lesson would encourage their heart father lead them and guide them to their individual positions and places in you lord jesus and make us all more effectual in the ministering of the gospel we ask these things this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen you love them this morning you may be seated this morning we certainly thank you musicians so we certainly love the lord i know it seems like we've had a lot of babies born here in the church in the last uh a few months and uh that we're so grateful for all the things that the lord are doing we've we've been studying uh through the year going through different sermons that brother branham had preached in plain portions of them and then going back over those portions and reading uh sections of them and the quotes and fellowshipping on those things and we'd like to pick that up again this morning so this won't be a revival meeting we have one of those coming up next week you know this will be sunday school this morning and just talking about the word of god laying hold of the things that were spoken to us and so we're going this morning to start in the message that's the next message on the path that we've been taking is called the rising of the sun and so if you do have your bibles he he reads three scriptures this morning one of them is found in revelations 1 through 18 and then and then he reads over in romans the and then he reads again in mark 16. so so when when he asked us to and he begins to read his text if you'd like to stand at that time and will stand for the reading of the text and then when he begins to talk about he says i want to take a text it is the rising of the sun then we can have our seats it's 22 minutes and then we'll make some comments afterwards tonight is communion service uh we're not going to have uh much preaching at all tonight we're just going to go straight into communion and foot washing so the both services will balance out is that fair okay good so uh we're just going to do this now at this time and so that'll be our scripture reading and we'll listen to 22 minutes we'll make some comments this morning and a lot of this was inspired to me by the message that the brothers had for their men's breakfast which was harvest time and it was uh it was uh very good the points and things that have been brought out so this morning you know we always ask do you love the lord but sometimes we need to ask do you know the lord loves you do you know that he loves you do you know what you have so i really believe you'll enjoy this little segment it'll go by we're starting in paragraph eight uh it is the rising of the sun we took off the first uh three minutes and and then we're going to go to the end of paragraph uh uh 43 and then and and that points where kind of brother brown changes uh subject so anyway lord richly bless you this morning i don't think of anything greater that a person could hear than the voice of god amen so lord richly bless you this morning as we fellowship on the things of the lord god bless you brother realizing that our time is limited here especially for those friends who are listening in by this telephone i would like to call your attention this morning to a a picture at some time a goal was taken by the camera of a vision that i had here at the tabernacle of leaving indiana to arizona where i was to meet in a form of a pyramid seven angels not knowing what would happen later when i got there thinking it was the end of my life but no one could stand the blast and i'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story and then in sabinia canyon one morning like this while in prayer there had been a sword placed in my hand and said this is the word and the story of the word later the angels appeared as was prophesied and at the same time a great cluster of light left where i was standing and moved 30 miles high in the air and around the circle like the wings of the angels and drawed into the skies the shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of angels that appeared science took the picture all the way from mexico as it moved from northern arizona or the holy spirit said it would be standing 40 miles northeast of tucson and it went into the air and life magazine packed the pictures a mystic something way in the spheres where there could be no moisture where there can be no evaporations of anything 30 miles high and 27 miles across and coming right up from where those angels were now they asked to know science the one of them in tucson wanted to know any significance but i didn't tell them you all knew it told beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you and so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mystery seven-fold mystery of the bible has been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings now hearing those mysteries marriage divorce serpentines all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself let's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days and now as this went up we have the picture outside on the plaque but then i have the picture laying present here if you notice as life magazine had it but i wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture see and the way it should be you remember i was preaching when this vision came upon the subject of the book of the revelations were the old judges where we seen jesus in revelations 1 when we started to open the seven seals of the or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of the seventh seal christ was standing with hair like wool white and i described that to you that the old english judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you probably see it in the audience it's christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turned the picture from this way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be and can you see it he is supreme judge there's none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication this message is the truth and making him not a third person but the only person with the white so you see the darkness faces seared in his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to on the cross that's where he looked to the right or he pardoned the sinner and the blight of his resurrection we still go forth in his name i wish this morning that i had just much time to to stand upon these phenomena that's beyond any shadow of doubt been proven for the past 30 years the 35 years right here at this church that's down on the river when that same light came down here in jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke those words as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second we're at the end times and we see it we wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the earth maybe sometime we'll have a chance to explain that as god willing now i want you to turn in in your bibles as we always believe that the word must come first of the reading of the word i always read that because if my words is the word of a man it will fail but the word of god can never fail now we're going to to read from the holy scriptures a text and we want you to turn first uh to um three places in the bible that i have chosen to read from one of them is in revelation the first chapter and the 17th and 18th verse this is where he appeared with his hair white as wool and his feet was like brass and then i want you also to get in your bibles romans 8 11. i've chosen this morning three places to read from the holy scriptures for my message today that the lord is placed upon my heart for the resurrection and then i want you to also mark 16 1 and two there i will draw my my context now in revelations 1 18 we read these words 17 and 18. and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and hell and in romans the eighth chapter and the eleventh verse we read this but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and now in mark the 16th chapter the chapter of the resurrection the 16th chapter the first and second verses and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalena the mother and mary the mother of gene and salome has brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun now my text this morning i want to take for a text it is the rising of the sun and for a subject i want to use the quickening power now you know you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speaking our noble brother neville this morning speaking his easter subject uh on the resurrection and i thought maybe i would take it a a little different path not to be different but just to add a little more maybe in another angle or you the scriptures every angle you go with the scriptures it always declares jesus christ you cannot get away from it anyway it always declares him now as the world today in a a memorial service or at least in the united states and this side of the earth this morning and the churches and throughout uh celebrating a memorial of the greatest triumph that man ever i think as savior when he died or as an infant when he was born he could not have been your less being coming into the earth and when he died shortly he had thrown for our sins but yet there's been many fine little babies born and there's been many man who has suffered and died for a real cause but there never was one that could raise yourself up again until this day now that it is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all times this easter is where he proved what he had said man can say things but yet it isn't exactly can be believed upon thoroughly until it's been proved to be the truth and it's god who said prove all things hold path to that which is good he would not tell you to do something that he would not do himself so he proved who this was that died for our sins and now not only is it a memorial day of all these great easter flowers and easter bonnets and pink rabbits and so forth that we've got into and holy celebrations which is all right but this is not the real thing and that way as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once the year on on uh thursday and on friday we should take the communion and all different doctrines they argue about where they should be this day or that day or what should be a sabbath day or the first day of the week or all these things are just merely tradition what good would any of it do you whether you had lent or not limp if there's no life in you it's only a memorial which is nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their traditions but left off the main thing satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life your won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this resurrection morning only uh uh one day in the year or certain day that we celebrate this are are we benefactors of his resurrection amen what does it mean to me what does it mean to you not we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago now to find this text as i was tired my arm hurting me from shots that the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days and i must have these shots standing on and with calories yellow fever and everything i was pretty weary making me sick which seizure requires to have these shots before you go into the other nation and he said give caesar that which is caesar but then give god that which is god and as i was sitting there wondering what would i speak to this waiting audience this morning which i'm very thankful for and men and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say how should i do it what should i take for a text and then while i was sitting there almost asleep my door rattled out on the front side of the house nobody being there but myself as far as i knew i listened i didn't get it just right after a while the den room door where i have turned into my study it rattled and someone kept shaking the door i went to the door and opened the door and to my surprise a pretty little yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there uh looked like a little easter flower is sitting here looking at me now she handed me a card and it was the uh of course i guess when i get home they'll be easter cards and so forth but the only one being leaving home that i'd received and she said brother branham this is from daddy and me she want to be sure that me was in it and her arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair had sent this card when i took it and thanked the little darling as she turned and walked away from the door i opened up the card and in the farm of this card i drew my text for on the card was the saint mark 16 1-2 sunup the sun was rising and then i thought of that and then the subject of the quickening of jesus christ to be raised up from the dead through my subjects now the sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without storm and it was bought and it was all covered with water and was laying there in this dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved up on that water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that or down beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light amen and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the sun rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that's southern like the sunrise on that easter morning this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came greater news with this sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise brought a news that he is risen he is quickened from the dead as he's promised he's risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a a dual sun rising another sun rising it was a not only s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised scenes that before knowledge he'd seen laying upon the earth no more could the botany life live back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is up on the earth it takes a s-o-n life to bring down to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world on easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that they're called this son of god raised it would also raise the life every son that was poor ordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at times when it first dawned a lot of stuff there amen isn't that wonderful amen so we're just going to just walk back over just a few paragraphs and and for you know for several reasons that we like to do this i think it's important for us to know what has been said and who said it so many times we hear somebody say brother branham said this and brother branham said that and brother brahm said this and you know for years when i first came into the message we didn't have all the tapes available to us there is no such thing as taking the message in your hand and pressing a few buttons if you wanted to hear something uh uh that brother random said you went and got a reel out somewhere you know and and you listened through it because you thought you heard it or you just recalled it by memory and in the early days i came into the message you know back in the late 60s beginning of 70 and there wasn't a lot of books coming out and i remember every time that i would get a book it would just be like like a treasure you know i didn't have them all i mean and we just go through it we'd read and we'd see things in it and it and it was rich but there were so many things said that weren't really said the way that he said it and it's natural for humanism to come in and we don't fault us for that but i found out there was many things that i said that he said that he never said you know and uh and it's kind of uh uh comes pretty straightforward when all of a sudden you hear it from him and i and uh i know there's an expression you know i like to get it straight from the eagle's mouth you know what i'm saying so that's why that we listen but also i like to do this because so many times we'll listen to a tape and we'll get get caught up in the the general subject you know what was the message about you know it was about quickening power but then we missed so many of the nuggets that were laid in there so many of the things that he alluded to how how many little of uh building blocks that he laid down for a foundation that we could build on later because no greater foundation can any man lay other than the word of god which is christ and so you get those things and they become principles they become things that you can count on one of the things brother graham always said that struck me and i know you've heard this he said that if god ever does one thing one way he continues to do that continually the same way but he can't come up with anything better remember last word week he said man they started with a club and a stick and went to a bow and arrow because they had danced he said but god gave us the atom bomb right from the beginning he gave us the best weapon that we could have and uh and so we we find out there's a lot of things that are sad but you've got to to know uh for yourself and so i feel that i i'm not interested in having any ministry of my own i wouldn't have a ministry if it wasn't for this message i mean you know what i'm saying i know a lot of guys study and see if they could come up with something new but i i have a divine revelation in my heart that the mysteries of god have been revealed you know i'm not looking for something new i'm not looking for something to break i'm not looking for something that's going to give me the key or open the door for me i believe that it's been stored up for me and that i can feast on the word of god so let's just go back and there's a few paragraphs that that stood out for me and the first paragraph was paragraph 11 and and i'm not taking or making light of any of the other things that were spoken or or leaving anything out because we could go through this message and then come back again two weeks or three weeks and listen to it again and have more of the word of god unfold and and each of you in here is a christian you started out and went to school and and and they taught you math and then as you grew and you understood that math they advanced you to something else and you learned something else and and uh uh and so you grew well well you know we're uh we're a young congregation most of us have come to the message after the messenger was here and and and we're learning we're from many different uh times of birth some have been in the message five years 10 years 15 years different ones so we're all coming together and we all learn together the greatest thing in our thing though is that we all learn from the same book amen the book of life and so i like this in this question because the prophet of god just again as we saw that he explained we have it here on the wall he explained about the vision that he had and how he saw these things and and then when this cloud appeared i liked how he described it he said it was a picture of the vision i had you know and and so it it he he was wondering and he told us in services this the time and he said you know life magazine had it this way but he said if but if you're looking up at it he said if you turn it this way you can see the image and the face of the lord and we can look at that and the white wig and how that he spoke it and he makes this statement because i find out that there's little things that brother branham says that only we hear you you understand that that it goes right over the top of of people's heads and and i i looked as i was looking at i was listening some statements that the prophet of god had made and i was on youtube and this other guy came up and he started trying to explain that when brother brahm said he saw that table go up and down he was trying to explain that was just a memory from brother branham being a a kid or something you know can and i i just sat back and i thought you know uh i guess that you could say whatever you want to say but brother bram just said here he says this proved what he was talking about do you know what i mean so if a guy could do the same works that he did if he could do the same signs and wonders if he could turn his back to the audience and discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart and there's thousands of people that witnessed that i've heard testimonies from many many people in this in this city that have seen and heard and listened to the prophet of god you could you cannot believe how many denominational and independent ministers that don't believe this message have been quoting brother branham's visions over and over and over again they don't believe who that he is but yet there's so many things that he said that they can't deny but he makes this statement here he says now they asked to know science the one of them in tucson wanted to know any significance but i didn't tell them you all know it told you beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you now when i see that statement i think why does a prophet of god prelude a message that he's fixing to preach and say it's for you because maybe there's something in there for me and he didn't say for us he didn't say you all he made it very personal it's for you it's for you it's for me and and so we can we can sit there and we can rest on this great thing that there's something that was hid and opened up in those seals that was for us the mysteries that was open another it goes back to it it was something that was elected and so let's read this next paragraph because i i really it blessed me and there was so much said in that that it's so quick just to breathe through it he says so so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be opened the seven mysteries the seven-fold mysteries of the bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world well how significant is this to us that we live in a day when mysteries that were sealed up from the foundation of the beginning of the world are going to be revealed now i wonder if we sit back and realize the phenomena and the power of what's transpiring because men have been poking out mysteries and trying to figure out the bible since the foundation of the world and what do we got 900 different ideas 900 different approaches 900 different ways to worship 900 different ideas and everybody's fighting one another to try to get their influence and collect their dollar but he said from the foundation of the world will be revealed a revelation is something that's previously hid and now made known that perks my attention there's something that you're going to know that believers have wanted to know since the foundation of the world how much do we treasure that how valuable is that i've collected a few coins and i i love to get little coins i like silver dollars and i can i as time ago i'd collect a few dollars in the dates and everything from when that they started and and and uh and i finally got a collection put together and there's one coin that i don't have and i looked and i searched for it and then i finally found one that was very leg very it wasn't very legible at all you couldn't see the dates on it at all but it was a coin and everything and i thought well i finally found this silver dollar and i inquired how much it was and they wanted 45 000 for it well i figured if i can't complete it i might as well sell it it's like having a puzzle without a piece but do you see how valuable that coin was to finish the collection so how valuable are the revelations that were hid from the foundation of the world to make you complete you understand it's not about completing the gospel it's about completing you it's about making you whole it's about opening your understanding and therefore it says it's for you it's not a study it was something that that you need so let's watch his key unfold just this one paragraph here he says that's been hidden from will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared to all the world we've enjoyed these blessings of hearing those mysteries now we have been but look at these next few statements and as we are going to sort of review some of the things that were opened up to us and he puts them in three categories he says he says he says this little humble group hearing the mysteries marriage and divorce serpent seed and all these different questions have been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself at the opened that's opened them seven mysteries of what the church was what the church was no not history not what the church was you know it was back in the early days in it it was persecuted like like a history no he's saying this revealed to by god to us what the church was to him what was it to him what was it what was it that he was doing what was it not not historically what it was but what it meant why why was this done and and we know this we could go to many other sermons and other messages and pull out many many quotes uh to emphasize on this but you know our messenger showed us he said what the church was it was the expression of god himself because he wanted he wanted someone he could have fellowship with he wanted someone that could express his attributes that he could have preeminence and receive worship so this is what this church was to him it was the expression of his attributes we that's been revealed to us since those seals have been opened in many different sermons what what what what it was when god did it when he decided to create man when he decided to create the earth we know that that there were those three great things that he wanted he wanted to reveal himself right he wanted to have preeminence fellowship right preeminence he wanted to be be the uh reveal and and have the preeminence in other words to be worshipped as god another he's first and so we could go to many places that these things have been been shown to us of what that god had in mind well nobody knew what god had in mind everybody just said well i was a sinner to begin with and one day i got saved and one day i'll get rewarded but the what was revealed to us was hid from the foundation of the world that's why nobody else could preach these things nobody went back to the beginning to never preach what was in god's mind well how could they know what was in god's mind you know how our messenger knew what god was in god's mind because god told them [Music] he told him what was in mind he told what he had in mind he revealed to him and showed him these things look let's look at number two there so first of all we understand now why that god created us in the first place oh let me tell you something if you know why he created you and then you know that god can do anything but lie he can't lie and he can't fail so if he had a reason for creating you that reason can never fail now he might have to do some skinning away and he might have to do some carving them like he told paul paul it's hard to kick against the prick you know i'm going to show you what you're going to suffer for me i had you called i had you wrote down in in the book of revelations in my mind that you were going to be that angel messenger to the gentiles now that's a revelation paul got a real good revelation of why he was wouldn't you like to know why you are that lies in the great message of the hour then he goes on he says in the second one is how because of what the church was and how it was in christ at the beginning how it was in christ at the beginning well how was he in her in the beginning that was a question we know that answer because when he opened those things he revealed you think the thing about it is are we taking these things because i believe the prophet of god is laying these things out there because these things are going to become part of our quickening they're going to be these understandings are going to be part of the things that allows us to change and overcome this flesh because the flesh is warring against the spirit if you don't know where you come from you don't know why you're here you don't think you have any reason in your life that's why people despair that's why people come to the place that they get in such a condition that they take their life because they don't have any idea what they're living for or why they should live but i'll tell you something if you know he created a place for you to be in glory it don't matter what you come against you you're the victorious i mean i can understand people looking at this world and say well i put all my money into a certain thing and the stock market crashes and i forget how many people took their lives in the black friday you can't lose something that's eternal and and so he he wanted to know uh how it was in christ in the beginning we know we are in christ in the beginning because we know we are a part of his thinking we are in his thoughts we know how we were in him in the beginning we were in him by the lamb's book of life just think of the understandings that have been been revealed to you and that week that he's saying it's for you in other words these things were opened up for you so you could know your names on the lamb's book of life could you know that you were in his thinking before the foundation of the world how many i love this quote i i know i'm going to paraphrase it but just to think how were we in him in the beginning the prophet of god said the color of your hair the color of your eyes the statue that you're in though it was a million many years and years and years ago yet he knew you then how you were in him by foreign knowledge how that he took the wedding band a predestination after put it on your finger and married you then he engaged you if i could say this in his thinking you say why would he pick a sinner like me because he had the power to change he didn't look at what you were by your first husband the mystery of marriage and divorce he knew what was going to happen when that husband died and he enspoused you and then so i just thought of these things how we could preach on how we are him in the beginning how we're in his thinking how we're in his thoughts how where our name was put on the lamb's book of life don't you love this great statement he says god put your name on the lamb's book of life and nothing can put it on and nothing can take it off so many people think oh i've done something to take me out of the mind of god no well you were yet sinners he died for you that's why he came for you because he knew he was going to come to you in the condition that the world and the flesh put you into he understood that's where you would be but oh what a price amen isn't that wonderful doesn't that just bless your heart to sit there and be able to know and even the disciples spoke to it and it laid right in the scriptures we were in him in the beginning foreordained unto good works that we should walk in him we're his workmanship in christ jesus and so we have a message that comes and just doesn't take it back to the gospel being preached he took it back all the way back to the beginning way back before this world ever came so we could totally understand that this world couldn't ruin it amen because it was already established in him in the beginning oh that opens a door to us it opens the door for us to look at the our pathetic state and know that that somebody else had something in mind for us and that we could turn to him and seek it and look for it and ask for great things to transpire in our lives on our behalf because of his will and that this last part he says and how it was in christ at the beginning how it was in christ at the beginning in his mind and then he says and how it would be revealed in the last day now he's talking about the church he's talking about the word bright how will the word bride be revealed in this last day how will it be made manifest how will it be revealed how will it come to the knowledge of itself so there's got to be a way that god has chosen to reveal to you who you are where you come from what your purpose was and so we he said how how is how is it how is the the bride church how is it going to be revealed in the last days well revelation is another word for faith how could this faith going to be revealed to the church in the last day how is this revelation of where she was in the beginning what she was and how she was going to be in christ in the beginning how was this going to be revealed to [Music] the bride church in the last days how is it going to happen and i know our first mind thought of our mind goes to malachi 4 5. but malachi 4 5 was just the vessel the prophetic vessel but who revealed where we were in him who revealed what we were that was done by the son of man when he shall come in the last days how did we know the last days by the sodom condition as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of sodom we understand that there was a way that he was going to come and reveal where you were who you were what you're in the beginning what you were he how was that going to be revealed and now he showed us how it was going to be revealed it was going to be revealed to us by luke 17 30. a prophet whom the lord could come and dwell in a vessel and speak to the thoughts and intents of your heart you didn't have to be discerned because it's the word that's sharper and more powerful than the two-edged sword it wasn't just a man that was preaching it was elohim god veiled in flesh in our day was going to be how that he was going to show us how it was going to be revealed to her in the last days it's not just some good bible student came along that was more than a man it was him whatever he said how many times did he say i i don't know you you don't know me but he knows you do you believe that he can use me or he through me can reveal to you the things that anybody else does he was showing us how he was going to do it in the last days can you imagine men who spent years and have phd and lld and and all these letters and all these initials and all these great trying to piece this bible together and yet god chose you and open your eyes to see him come back in this gentile church age and show you where you were with him in the beginning and who that you really are oh praise god hallelujah how do we value that is it a pearl of great price to you this is a treasure hid in the field do we see what it is how great it is and what a magnificent uh wonderful uh thing that he's done for us to to make known to us these great things all that was in that two paragraphs i think sometimes we we skim instead of study and god has many ways to speak to us through song through the ministry through fellowship through edification but these things i think are necessary that we set them in our hearts and if i could use the terminology maybe it's not a good terminology but when you can look at the message the overview of what it is you can understand why it doesn't fit in a denominational system why it has to be something above a man-made system how it's got to be something personal how it's got to be something that it is uh uh anointed to you and revealed to you and and shown to you how it would be revealed in this last days it wasn't going to be revealed through a system it wasn't going to be revealed to an organization and if it's not revealed that way then it can't become one the only thing man can organize is their own thinking and many of us have a hard time organizing our own thinking but aren't you glad that he chose flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father which in heaven has revealed this to you so he laid to us right then the understanding that this church was not going to be revealed by any other thing than divine revelation pray for revelation more than ever more than anything else pray for revelation how beautiful it's laid there and this we have a lot of pages to go through in the next few services but i like this statement that he made in the 16th uh paragraph at the end of the paragraph he said he said from him cometh this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to and on the cross that's where he looked to the right and he pardoned the sinner in the light of the resurrection we still go forth in his name another when you say in how many in our language we say in the light of in other words with the understanding of or with the knowledge of or in the light of these facts or in the light of the new evidence or in the light of what's been shown another the light is the understanding in in the light what does a light do a light shows the hidden things of that of darkness another the light shines into the dark places of our understanding the questions you might have the answers that you might have the wonderment you might have about why your life came the way it is why did you do the things you do all the different failures that we have about our lives but when the light is shined on them then in the light of the resurrection we go forward knowing that he is not dead but he is alive and he lives forever more and because he's risen that makes him present to be able to perform and carry out every promise that's how we go forward in the light and the understanding that he's alive how real is that to us that it's it's beyond the story that he is he wasn't the i was or the will be he says i'm the i am i am the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me in the light of the fact that he rose from the dead all things are possible in the light that he overcame death hell in the grave in the light of the revelation and understanding of his resurrection we go forward why can we face the challenge because he's risen how come we don't fear death because he's risen how come we know won't be overcome by the enemy because he's risen amen what what what what was his resurrection it was the revelation that there was life after death think of what he revealed think of what it means to us this is not the end of us this is just the beginning that we're not stuck with these bodies that we will receive a body likened unto his praise god amen think of what what it was that's what we go forward with oh satan you made me sick i got another one hallelujah i love that quote i hold it in my heart again i may just paraphrase it but he said if god wants you to go he says there's not enough doctors in medicine to keep you here but if god wants you to remain there's not enough sickness or devils to take you how can we go forward with that because we have the light and the revelation of the resurrection which is we know there's life after death if we if it's not made right here it'll be made right there oh you talked about wonderful i mean everything that satan had he threw at him and he overcome and we can be overcomers as he overcame so can we overcame by the word of our testimony what a wonderful thing that we go forward in the light of the resurrection we go forward with the understanding of the life after death it's why we live that's why we make our choices that's why we're willing to sacrifice and give up of this world because we know there's a resurrection we know if he rose from the dead he promised us that we will also rise i am the resurrection and then i like this little statement he made at the bottom of that paragraph he says we're at the end time we see it the last sentence in paragraph 17. we're at the end time we see it we wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the earth maybe some time we'll have a chance to explain that if god willing you know how he explained to us it was nothing but jealousy you know what i mean that everybody would become equal there'd be no big eyes or little use we'd all had one absolute we would all had one voice we would all had one interpretation wouldn't that be wonderful all of us in one mind and one accord united around one thing everybody recognizing that the lord had come back in our generation and answered the questions revealed where we come from what we were what we was what it was where it was at in the beginning and we all saw how god was revealing it but it's funny isn't it jealousy that's what he said it's just pure jealousy that's what cain was he was jealous because god accepted his sacrifice they're jealous because god chose a little man without a great college education that wasn't a part of their system to have the world's greatest revival since the time of the lord pure jealousy because they couldn't see what it was they couldn't see the cloud they couldn't see the pillar of fire they couldn't hear the gospel they were jealous and then he goes on later in one of the messages he says they had nothing in them to believe with how come it didn't sweep across the world because they had nothing in them to believe with how many i saints i've met people that are better christians than i am they got such a sweet spirit and such a meek spirit and nothing rattles them and they just flow through life you know and okay and you think well life's easy you know well you know get under some of that pressure you don't think that pressure will drive you place the prophet of god said i didn't care if every single one of them went over a cliff you know it's pretty hard to walk a mile but when you get in somebody else's moccasins right you know what that is don't you that's brotherly kindness that's understanding what's going through what kind of pressure's been put on you know i don't have a great pressure maybe at 300 350 people or so in our congregation just think of that that that responsibility that i have that i'm going to be judged for every word that i say for every insinuation i make whether i tell the truth or don't tell the truth how would you like to carry the whole church age the seals the mysteries that were hid from the foundation of the world how would you like to carry that pressure on you people say they want to be a prophet they can have it how'd you like to sit up here and know every secret that's every one of your hearts i don't want my secrets known so i certainly don't want to know your secrets i don't want no tit for tat you know just let the blood cover us from all unrighteousness do you know what i mean but but you you think why didn't it spread well he didn't have anything in him and to believe with how much more pressure to you then is the revelation that god gave you especially you people in school you young men young women that are just starting your lives and starting to come into places where you'll you'll have peers and you'll have business associates okay and you're moving out from school into life how much greater is it to bear the reproach of this message because you know it's been given to you to believe would you sell that elvis presley had it can you believe it but he sold it for a fleet of to be a movie star to be called the king how what kind of torment do you think he's going through now i don't know whether it was true but i've been told that wherever he's buried there over at graceland that they pump his music in around his tomb his own voice his own choices and everything coming right back at him to torment him why would we sell what we've got for a few praises of the world you know i know what it's like to be resisted and i know believe me i have enough discernment to understand where it comes from but you know what we go with the resurrection stand all you want goliath it's thus saith the lord you're a part of that may i just jump ahead he's going to talk about the power the quickening power that can come into you so you have victory over all things we're just going to close up here we just got a few more statements i thought paragraph 32 was good for those that battle with vaccination i don't know if he put it up there or not but but i'm not going to preach at on vaccination i told you i got vaccinated because i wanted to go into canada so i have a perfect quote because hook is whatever choice you make just make it along with the word don't let anybody force you either way you have backbone in your conviction if you're convicted not to take it then don't take it you know but if if you're in a situation and they're bringing that question to you this might help you is that fair enough so what did he say here he said that he said now if it's and if he began to preach and so we go to paragraph if i could say paragraph 30 1. he said therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial now we have a memorial to george washington i always wanted to see it one time we went to washington to see and i i looked at this great big piece of rock sticking up in the air and believe me it didn't let me know george washington any more than i knew him i went to lincoln memorial and i saw a great big statue of abraham lincoln and i thought man he must have come from the land of nod he must be a great you know a straight uh descendant of goliath i didn't know abraham lincoln any more than i ever know i couldn't tell you one thing about abraham lincoln i can't tell you if he liked barbecue or tortillas i don't know he might have liked fufu and salsa i don't know i don't know nothing about abraham lincoln i don't know nothing about george washington except for that he never told a lie and the bible said that's a lie so that whole memorial is a lie that he chopped down a cherry tree think of it memorials memorial you know sunday morning is not supposed to be a memorial to the resurrection we're just gleaning this morning you understand we're just going back over the statements brother random made so we can talk about this morning i know i'm doing the talking but you're amenning and you're in the spirit of it so that we can talk about the things that he's telling us the idea when you start a message is not to get to the end of it the idea is to see jesus christ in every word and he said if you don't go back and read it again these things this word that was put in the storehouse and you know and thank the lord for brother roy borders and brother doug mccues those guys that started spoken word and started printing these things in a garage in tucson to get them out to us that we can go back and have something that we can hear read and pray the three ways which people learn in sales we had a method and it was you tell them tell them what you told them that's what you do you tell them then you tell them what you told them hardly anybody ever learns on the first go around people who learn everything the first time around you can't imagine how much of themselves they have in it the word has two parts to it first the killing and then the resurrection first the sacrifice then the life first of all you've got to give up your own thinking in order to receive his thinking so he says here in this paragraph he said he says satan don't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow the whole catholic church is based on the fact i i've watched them i grew up with them the mass time comes everybody gets real pious they start doing their rosary they start going through it and it's really something and then when it's over they all get up they're done and they're out of that spirit they go in and confess their sins oh i'm so sorry they go do their penance like their candles they're gone he don't care how religious you are in closing here it's the life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you been born again that was paragraph 30 and 31 he says therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial something to look at it's not a memorial he raised him up so you could know him that you didn't have to deal with history that he he's here so he can introduce himself to you you can meet him he can make his presence known you might say well i didn't see him in the flesh but i'll tell you i felt them i don't go on feelings but i'll tell you what also i've seen i've seen that everything that he said manifest i know he's here because he keeps his promises and so he said did he raise them up for a memorial no and and is the resurrection morning only a one day a year or a certain day that we celebrate or are we benefactors of his resurrection so what did he do he put in you the same spirit his spirit that he had that's why he rose up go wait there until you're a dude with power from high i won't leave you comfortless i will come again i'll be in you he raised up so he could come back and put the same spirit that was him in you if the same spirit that was in christ jesus dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body what do we hear the gospel for not for a memorial not for a study on what's right and wrong but that same spirit that was in him i'm going to close with a little thought but i'm going to read this right here it said he put in you the same spirit his spirit that he had and used to raise himself from the dead do you know that quick he said he used that spirit to raise himself from the dead you could go to saint john the gospel of john the 10th chapter remember communion tonight's just going to be straight communion service do i have that right here john 10 and 18. he says therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of my soul i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father he gave he gave that commandment to us he says i'm going to give to you the power the quickening power the same spirit that i had i'm going to put it in you that you can lay down your life and take it up again we can read john 11 25 it says and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whoever believeth and believeth in me shall never die believeth doubt this john 14 and six another great scripture jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh in the father but by me amen just think of it every bit of it right there is that it's not a memorial it's something he's going to transfer and then if we just close up here with paragraph 30 7 and 38 he says now the son at the rising of the sun will there be was a time when the world laid in utter darkness it was without form and void and it was all covered with water and was lying there in dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon the water and said let there be light and god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was a seed that he had planted and it had to have the sunlight to make it live and the first light that ever was given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word you know the bride church could not come into existence until the word was spoken to bring her to life just think not a denominational life not a life of psychology or philosophy or education in science but their true life was hidden in christ and the only thing that can bring you to life is the true unadulterated spoken word of god not the taught word of god but the spoken word of god that's why this messenger could not be of education he couldn't have dogma he couldn't have creeds he had to be a vessel that god could speak through and he would have thus saith the lord and then he goes on to talk about the sun being brought up and it's gotta made an atmosphere and he said what was it to do it was to bring joy and life two times he talks about it joy in life this wasn't meant to be gloom it wasn't woes me i've got eternal life i've passed from death on the life but nobody in the world believes it so i'm stuck down here with a bunch of these nimba cells and it's just so bad that i got to go to work and i got to deal with this and i got to deal with that it's not why they came for it it came forth that you might have joy and life that you might know you've got eternal life nothing's passing you by he's with you and he'll be with you all the way through and and so he says so he said he said and i and i wrote this note he said you are a direct product of what you have heard and what was revealed to you you are what you are because of the word of god in the story i i imagine all the time what i would be or where i would be or what would have i have done or what could have i have been how great would this be or how great would that be i'm a direct product of what i heard i heard california was going to sink i came out i heard there was baptism in the name lord jesus christ i got baptized i heard there was only one god i don't believe in a trinity you're a direct product of what you've heard in other words what's been revealed to you god changes your mind he transforms your thinking he transforms your look on life he's actually taking you where you are going on one road and he comes along and he puts his word and he speaks to you you become a direct effect of that word and you transform into what he had in mind for you to begin with how does he do that he does it by the spoken word he changes you he's not done changing us praise god give me more word let me listen to more word i want more change change comes by the word of god you are a direct if you shut that voice off that's where you stop the minute you think i know all he said i understand everything he said there's nothing more to be revealed i have it all here on tape just as long as i have it on tape i'm okay no it's got to speak to you it's got to transform you okay and so we we know that great thing that he said that we're a direct product he says so the sun has risen to bring eternal joy and life and resurrect and revelation that there's life after death and i'd like to say this in closing why this is all so wonderfully important that we understand the resurrection though leslie and sharon with had the morning devotion and listening to a portion of what the prophet of god said and brother graham said there's two mountains one's mount sinai and the other one's mount calvary he said too many people are living on mount sinai mount sinai is the history of your failure mount sinai was thou shalt not steal you know why he had to say thou shalt not steal because they stole every man did what was right in his own eyes why did he say thou shalt not commit adultery because man is an adulteress he's an idol worshiper he's a blasphemer he's bear's false witness and when you come and you live on mount calvary then you read the gospel and the prophet of god preaches you you shouldn't be this way you shouldn't be that way you shouldn't be that way you can't stay on mount sinai this message can condemn you to where you don't think you have a choice you would say i don't have the holy ghost i don't have the holy spirit if you stay on that mountain that mountain continually locks you in prison and tells you you're guilty you're a failure you're a sinner what's he telling you that this flesh can never make it but praise god for mount calvary because that's where he come and says the debt is paid i paid for it i've wiped it off your record don't look at yourself this way anymore i'm going to reveal to you the way to look at yourself that you were in me in the beginning look at yourself don't look at yourself from this mountain where if you stepped on it you died but look at it from this mountain look at it from the other mountain there's two mountains what is the rising of the sun it's the revelation of the mountain that gave you life that transforms you that allows him to come into you the very person that mount sinai condemned calvary paid the price and made the difference and set you free oh praise the lord there's a power there's a quickening power a power to bring you to life and next weekend we have a revival meeting but when we come back we'll start talking more about the power how it came from how god reveals it to us in the last day and what it's going to do for us what it has done and what it's going to do and how that we can become complete creatures in the statue of a perfect man by the spoken word of god god bless you 12 30. let's stand together this morning and i know many of us battle many things in the flesh but the scripture tells us that he's overcome them all right so let us show up bow our heads and if the musicians would play and before brother billy comes to close the service again this evening communion foot washing we'll go right into the communion and foot washing service after the song service and so you can go home if you would like to study along and take the message is the rising of the sun and mark out all the nuggets and things that you see and maybe some of us will align up or maybe new things will be opened and and we can just fellowship i love fellowshipping around the spoken word of god for the hour if you have a desire in your heart this morning if [Music] you want to do better and you feel that there was a life that came forth out of the grave paid the price of sin and what was the wages of sin it was death so he paid the wages of sin and he died and they put him into the grave where he would be corrupted and go back to earth again but the word said i shall not suffer my holy one to see corruption and he came forth and proved to us and revealed testers life after death as our messenger said he proved that everything that he said was true beyond the shadow of a doubt [Music] he's here for your healing [Music] he's here for your deliverance over the sin that so easily besets us he's here to give us peace that's your path understanding and joy unspeakable if you have a need today not only in your physical life but in your spiritual life and you like to lift your hands to them and say lord you know what i have need of before you even ask before i even ask you lord you already know what it is now lord i might present you a laundry list of all the things that i need all the things that you should do in order to make my life better but father i'm going to stop this morning i'm not going to tell you how to do it i'm not going to tell you why lord i'm just going to lift my hands and say lord i see my condition and i'm asking you to change me according to your word and according to your will i'm asking that you transform me father into what your word says that i am and i want to put myself on the potter's wheel and let you mold me and make me this morning i know my sins are forgiven because you said well i was yet a sinner you died for them father you said nothing could be laid charged to god's elect because the seed remained within him for i'm not going to mount sinai to tell you i'm a sinner i'm going to the other mountain i'm going to calvary for where resurrection life was put on display and i'm asking you to raise me from the dead that i'm in [Music] i'm asking you to raise me from the doubts i'm asking you to deliver me from the pain and the sickness [Music] that has gripped a hold of me for so long lord i'm coming to you by the promise of the resurrection this morning and we believe it and we accept it and jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen has anybody ever been sorry you've chosen the lord no i like that song i've never been sorry we'll see that as our dismissal song this morning and you say well why would you sing that brother david because i want you to get off of mount sinai you know i mean i don't want you to keep going there and having the word of god show you what a sinner you are i want you to go to calgary where you know those sins are taken away and he's got a quickening power that'll transform you can't believe that
