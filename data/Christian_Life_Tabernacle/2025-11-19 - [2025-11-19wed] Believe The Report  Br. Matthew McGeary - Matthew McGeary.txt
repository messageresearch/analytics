Description:
Believe The Report
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 19th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

How many believe they got the victory? &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is the God of victory. Amen. Amen. We don't have any written request up here. Amen. There was an announcement in the youth chat, but my phone died. So, um, &gt;&gt; yeah, just help me out. Can you just come up here and you'll, uh, pray for the offering? So, amen. The brothers that are taking the offerings if you could be ready before the Lord. we were able to arrange uh a group camping area at Lake Grapevine and so we sent out an announcement for it. The area is for only made available to groups that would be camping. Um but it is a very nice group area. We sent out a little video of it, but there's an area day use area for families, picnic area and things like that. But um what we're doing is going to have a bonfire, an opportunity for testimony, and um it's a public park, so you anybody could go, but for what we've paid for and reserved, um we're allowed like 25 cars and really enough room to take care of most people. Um and most so depending on what it looks like and who comes out, we can accommodate extra vehicles. So, there's just some parameters, but it's at Lake Grapevine at Mural Park. Um, and we if you want to show up earlier than like 4, let me know. We can get you in, but that's that's kind of the basis of the announcement. Um, that it's at Meadow Mir Park. So, let me correct that. So, it's at Meadow Mir Park on Lake Grapevine and we can check in from 2 PM and have to be gone by 100 pm Saturday, but there's ample area for those who want to camp or tent and uh otherwise it's going to be a time for bonfire and fellowship. So, let's just uh there was no request, but I know that um there's always a need upon our heart and something that we want the Lord to do for us. So, let's just go before him and pray. Gracious heavenly father, as we come to this part of the service, Lord, even myself was eager to come and Lord, there was things and cares that had pressed upon me, Father, and we just came in late. And it was just such a joy to walk into this sanctuary and to hear the praises of your people being sung. And Lord, even just to reflect on the wonderful things you just did [music] this past weekend. And Lord, in all that we do, we want to give you our all, give you first place. We want you to sit on the throne of our heart with nothing in between. [music] And Lord, we just ask now if there's any small hindrance, Lord, that we would just brush them aside, Father, and give you the complete preeminence. Lord, we're we're nothing truly without you. Lord, you're the one who gave us our breath this morning to rise to praise you. [music] There's nothing that we in ourselves could keep in our own hands, Lord. Not even the things we take for granted if it's not for the grace of God. If it's not for you, Father, we wouldn't have them. So, we just want to tender our hearts once again before you and [music] Lord, proclaim you, Lord of all, Lord, I have nothing that you aren't in control of. So, I just surrender myself to you. Ask that you'd speak to my heart, to my mind. Lord, that your people here who've gathered, Father, you'd move supernaturally. [music] Lord, would we look past humanity, the felity, and Lord, see you once again speaking to us. [music] Father, we commit it to you in all the sincerity we know how and ask that you would have your will and way in the service. Forgive us, Father. We We don't want to be left, Lord, in any place that Lord needs a [music] furtherance. Lord, we want to go further. You know, our hearts cry and how we desire [music] to express it. May just be according to your will. In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Oh, why [singing] would I [music] worry when giants come calling my name? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My God [singing] is so much bigger than all [music] this fear. Oh, why [music] would I [singing] hunger for power which is all faith? [music] My [singing] God is so much bigger than all [music] this. I won't be shen. I [music] won't be good. My God is faithful. [singing] His [music] promises is true. I'll speak to the mountain each time [music and singing] to move. Our God [music and singing] is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Oh, and [music and singing] my enemy scattered for the whole battle is [music] done. Oh, and [singing] my God is stronger. The victory. [music] Hallelujah. He [music] died for [singing] my race and rose up on the third [music] day. Oh, and my God is greater [music] than heaven. I won't [music] be sh I want you. [music] My [singing] God is faithful. His promises [music and singing] is true. I'll speak to the mountain. [music] It's time to move. My God is bigger, [music] [singing] better, stronger, greater than you. Oh, there's no [music and singing] mountain to high, no valley to know. There's [singing] no fear that I have. He [music] doesn't already know. There's no problem to be. There's [music and singing] no weapon too strong. There's nothing that's [music and singing] impossible. Oh, there's no mountain to hide. Oh, no valley too [music and singing] low. There's no fear that I have. It has already known. There's no [music] problem to me. There's no weapon too strong. There is nothing [music] for God. God's impossible. Oh, and [music] I'll be [singing] shaking. I [music] won't be. Our God is faithful. [music] His promises is true. Oh, let [music] us speak to the mountain. It's time to move.

H how glad are we to have a God who's bigger, better, and stronger than anything we can face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How we praise him tonight. Amen. I was sure by now that you would have reached down and [music] wipe our tears [singing] away. Oh, stepped in and sed. Oh, and by [music] the loss again. Oh, [singing] and I'll sing my history. [music] Oh, and as the time go. [music and singing] Oh, and I'll hear your whisper through the rain. Oh, [music] I we hallelujah. Oh, and as [music] your mercy falls. Oh, and I'll raise my hands to praise the God [music] who [singing] gives and takes away. [music] Oh, and I'll praise [music] you in this stor. I will lift [music] my hand for you are who you are. No matter where I am, oh every tear [music] I cry, you're holding your hand. [music] You never left my side and know my heart is [music] Lord and I'll praise you in this song.

Hallelujah. He's the present help. Oh, as the time Oh, I [music] will hear your whisper through the rain. Oh, I'm with [music] you. Oh, and your mercy fall.

Never left my [music] side. Though my heart is told I'll praise you [music and singing] in this. I remember [music] when I [music and singing] remember when I stumbled in the [singing] wind heard my cry and you raised me [music and singing] up again. My strength is almost gone. How can [music] I carry on? If I can't find you. [music and singing] And as the thunder [music and singing] rolls, I hear you whisper through the rain, [music] I'm [singing] with you. And as your mercy [music and singing] falls, I pray on him. I praise the God [music] who [singing] and he takes away. [music] I will praise [singing] you with this Lord and I will lift [music] my hands. You are who you are. No matter where I [singing] am, [music] in every tear I cry. [singing] Oh, you hold in your hand. [music] You never left my side. Though my heart is I'll praise [music] you in this stor. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just go before him. &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord, we are so thankful and we could have the revelation to know that all things work together [music] for good to those that are called according to your purpose, Lord. And we go through trials. We go through heartaches, [music] Lord. We go through turmoil. Many times we can't even explain or understand. the Lord down in our soul there's a revelation just like Job said that one day though the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord Lord we have that revelation in our souls to know Lord that all good things have come from you Lord and we thank you for it Lord if [music] something's to be taken away from us Lord we know we haven't lost anything for soon and very soon we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and everything that we love and hold dear Lord Lord will be with and we'll be with you for all eternity. [music] Lord, we love you. We thank you for the songs that have been sung and the opportunity to come be together with our brothers and sisters once again. We love you, Lord. We just commit [music] the remainder of the service, asking that you would just come, Lord, and break the bread of life to your children as only you can. [music] We ask it in your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of Numbers chapter 13. It's just good to be uh back in the house of the Lord. We really enjoyed our meetings with brother Tom and brother Michael and just the services that were preached. Um brother um Tom preaching my children give me your heart and uh just what a moving service to to call to all of us to give him all of our heart and all that we can. And brother Michael uh preached on beyond the last breath. We're so thankful that uh this natural breath that we breathed is is is not the one that counts, but it's that spiritual breath that God has given us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you know, even if we went by the way of the grave, one of these days, we're going to step into that new body. Amen. And that last sermon that brother uh Tom preached, just what a what a wonderful word that he cares. He does care. Aren't you glad he cares? &gt;&gt; And I believe he's come once again. He cares about where we're at and what we're going through and what we have need of and we're just looking to him to speak to our hearts. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Reading out of Numbers chapter 13 and verse 25 through3. Just I going to try to be short, but I know that doesn't work a lot. But we know we've had long weekends and we've all got right back into work. So, I know some of us are maybe run down and tired from the weekend, still recovering. Some of you, I don't know about about y'all, but I'm still recovering. Amen. So, numbers 13 and 25 says, "And they returned from searching of the land after 40 days, and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, into the wilderness of Pan and Teadish, and brought back word unto them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land." And they told him and said, "We came unto the land whether thou sentest us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great." And moreover, we saw the children of Anoch there. The Amalocites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. And Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it." But the men that went up with him said, "We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we." And they brought up an evil report of the land which they have searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. And there we saw giants, the son of Anoch, which come of the giants, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and we were as so we were in their sight. Amen. We just ask a blessing on the reading of the word. You may be seated. I also want to just read out of Isaiah 53 and verse one. Uh this is uh you know Kadesh Barnea is a a very um important part of scripture because here the children of Israel are coming to cross over into uh the promised land. And you're seeing uh an evil report is rising up. And in Isaiah 53 it says, "Who who hath believed our report? into whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? And you know, report is news. It's it's tidings. And I'm so thankful I've heard the good news. &gt;&gt; I've heard the gospel. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and he is alive. &gt;&gt; And it says, "Who hath believed our report?" And brother Brandon would say this in the sixth seal. Just a short comment on this scripture. He says, it said, "Who hath believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? See, believe the report. &gt;&gt; Then the arm of the Lord is revealed. The arm, the word of God is revealed. Believe the report. &gt;&gt; So maybe that would be my title tonight. Believe the report. &gt;&gt; Whose report are you going to believe? Because here here in uh the children of Israel that they sent the 10 spies and they they went over into the land and and they spied it out and they brought back the evidence that it was a good land and and Joshua and Caleb said, "Hey, we're more than able to go." But watch, there was an evil report that rose up and we might just uh just preach on some of these things with the help of God. Some familiar things that's been on our heart here recently. And one of the things that struck me, I was listening to the conflict between God and Satan. And brother Brandon would say this. He'd say, "The other night I was preaching. I believe it w it was at the tabernacle and I struck something that's done me more good than anything I've thought of since I've been converted." &gt;&gt; That should make your ears perk up. &gt;&gt; I'll read it again in case some of you are were shuffling or going through something. He was preaching the other night and he said he struck something that's done me more good than anything I've thought of since I've been converted. &gt;&gt; I when I heard that I went, "Wow." Well, I want to know more about that. He said, "I might repeat again if it's if that's all right. I I I I know I know where you know that where I'm going to, but but it was that evidence of salvation." He says, "It just struck me and I said it." I went home and I got in my room and I I walked up and down the floor. I I just had a little good time by myself, you know, just in there thinking about it. And here's what it was. I might pass it on to you just for a minute. I was talking about we are possessors of all things. Everything is ours. Isn't that wonderful how in in Galatians 3:29 it would say if you're Abraham's seeds, then we're heir. We're we're heir of everything. We're heir of the promise. We're we're heir of all things. And brother Brandon would go on and show you can take that down. Brother Brandon would go on and show how he would say that we're possessors of all things. You know that we're possessors of joy. We're possessors of love. We're we're possessors of peace. And and all of these things were heir to. It's all given to us. And he would start to show how, you know, you can't go down to the store and you can't buy yourself some love. You can't you might think you can, but look, you can't buy love. You can't go down to Walmart and go down and ask the store clerk and say, "You know, I was just in here looking for some peace." And I'd come to the store and I've been looking up and down. I was going to tell you, if you're looking for peace, don't go to Walmart. You're not going to find you're not going to find peace at Walmart. It's it's not going to be there. You know, you're not going to be able to go into into Walmart and and and go to the the the clerk and, you know, say, "I'm looking to buy some joy. I'm I'm looking to buy some peace. I I'm I'm I looking for something." You're not going to find it in Lady Osia. You're not going to find it in in your job. It might be temporary. Sure, there's things that we might do and you find some joy and some some satisfaction. But all of those things are going to perish. They're all going to pass away. But but there's a there is a peace that paths understanding. There is a joy that comes from the Lord. And and and the prophet of God is showing how we're possessor of all things. We possess love. We possess joy. We we we possess peace. All of these things are ours. We're possessors of all things. And he would go on saying, you know, uh just thinking about our inheritance and thinking about Israel and and how they were in bondage for 400 years and a and and here come here they are just uh being beaten by their task masters and the slaves are I mean that the the the slave drivers are hitting them with the whips and here they are in bondage and here comes a a a prophet coming out of the wilderness and he's telling look look you don't have to be in bondage anymore. Uh uh God is going to take you over into the promised land and and no more mud pits and and no more being beat over your back. You don't have to live like that anymore. I want to tell you what a message that would be that that a prophet would come and say, "Look, you don't have to be in bondage anymore. You don't you don't have to be whipped by task masters that say go here and and go there and do this and do that." But here come a prophet with a message saying, "Look, we're we're God is going to take you out of here by a mighty hand and he's going to take you into a promised land because you're an heir. And we know the story about how God brought them out uh by a mighty hand. And the prophet would say this. He he would say, "And Joshua went over into the promised land." Now remember, none of them had never been there. They didn't know whether the land was actually there or not. &gt;&gt; They just by faith went by what was told them &gt;&gt; that God had a place for them &gt;&gt; and they was going to that place just by faith. Now think of that. left Egypt and God brought them out. And now they're nearing the land. And when they get near the land, Joshua goes over into the land and brings back the evidence. Crosses Jordan, goes over into Palestine, brings back the evidence, a great bunch of grapes that had taken two men to pack, and they could eat those grapes. And he said, "The land is just exactly what God said it was." Look, Joshua and Caleb came back with the fruit and it was the evidence that it showed. Look, this is exactly what God said it was. Look at the grapes. Look at the fruits. Look at the things that when we went over, we were able to look out into the land and and it's a land that flowth with milk and honey. It's everything that God promised. It's everything that he said it was. And they brought back packing the evidence. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you the same thing about the message of the hour. It's everything that God said it was. It is my joy. It is my peace. It is my salvation. It's everything that I ever wanted. It's everything that I ever needed. It will save you. It will keep you. It will take you into a rapture. It will take you up out of the grave. It's my salvation. It's I It's my It's my justification. It It's my sanctification. I It brings the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Why? Because it's the promise of the age. Just like God sent Noah, a prophet, with a message to be able to escape the oncoming judgment. God sent a prophet with a message. That's exactly what the message of the hour is. If you want to enter into the promised land, I say God has sent a word. He sent a message. And if you believe it by faith, it'll take you into every promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The land is just exactly what God said it was. It's everything. Not just a promise of another age, you know, not just something of a of a day gone by, but what is the hour that we're living in? We're living in the age of adoption. We're we're living in the hour of the fullness of restoration. This is the adoption of sons. Look, we don't want to stop short and just be satisfied with a a good feeling or I've been I've been delivered of my sins or, you know, I I've gone to church and I've done my duty and and the burden of sin has been lifted. But no, we've given been given a promise and we want to enter into all the promises of God. We want to possess this vest vessel in sanctification and honor. We want to see the adoption and the placing of sons and the maturity. We don't want to just be in babies and and and and pampered around and patted on the back and and up and down and up and down and always wondering, am I in and am I out? Am I going in the rapture and I'm not going to rapture? Am I the bride and am I not the bride? Am I just foolish virgin? and maybe I'll I'll start handing out cups of water to everybody at church so just in case, you know, I miss the rapture, I can make it in because I was good to somebody in the bride. But that ain't no way for you to think. The devil puts those thoughts in your mind and he's trying to rob you of everything that you're heir of. You're possessor of all things. &gt;&gt; Everything is ours. And I say there ought to be a cry in the heart of the people that would say, "Let us go up at once." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're more than able to do it. Let it let us go up at once. Let's take the land, church. What are we waiting for? We we waiting for some great calamity and we finally get into desperation. We we got to lose a loved one. We got to lose a family member. Something has to happen or we finally get uncomfortable in our jobs or we lose our job or we lose our health or something happens and we finally get in desperation. We finally start to call on the name of the Lord. I say, "Let's get into desperation now. Let's get the love of God in our heart. Let's get a love for the Bible. Let's get a love for prayer. Let's get a love for the message of the hour. Let's sell out lock, stock, and barrel. Look, if you gave everything you had to the world, I say some of us live pretty hard out in the world. I say, let's live pretty hard for Jesus Christ. Let's give all of our heart. Let's give all of our time. Let's give all of our effort. Let's give everything that we have to the Lord Jesus Christ. Why don't we just live for Jesus? Preach for Jesus. Why don't we do everything for the Lord Jesus Christ? Hey, some people, you might not be sold out, but I want to tell you, if you can get on the back side of the desert and you can be Jesus Christ, he'll change your life. He'll change the way that you think. The Bible said if if that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you, it will also quicken your mortal body. I say, Lord Jesus, quicken my thoughts. Quicken my actions. Quicken the things that I say. Quicken the things that I do. Quicken me in church to hear the word. I don't want to sleep on the word. I don't want to come in and go back on a change. I don't want to come in here unimpressed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst?" &gt;&gt; I think some of us aren't impressed. &gt;&gt; We're more impressed with CBN and NBC and ESPN and all those other letters out there. &gt;&gt; It's funny how a movie can hold your attention for three hours. You can you can be so tired and want to go to sleep, but turn on a movie and for some reason you're wired for three hours. But if you open up your Bible, &gt;&gt; it's like good night. You want to go to sleep, put on a tape, that'll put you to sleep. You want to stay up, put on something that your flesh likes, and all of a sudden you'll be wired and glued. I say there ought to be something in the believer's heart to say, "That ain't the way." Uh-uh. Devil, you ain't going to anoint my flesh like that. I I [screaming] I'm going to sell out to the Holy Ghost and fire. I'm going to read my Bible. I'm going to pray. And if I get tired, I'm going to stand up and pray. If I can't read my Bible, if I walk in, I'm going to do something because this body is going to read the word of God and listen to the message of the hour. And I say it's about time we we kick all the Tommy rod out, all the other stuff that we're giving our time and attention and start giving our time to the word. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm here to encourage you with what the with what the the the the the meetings we just went through and and what's on my heart. I want to believe his report. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we want to come out of these meetings running. We want to come out of these meetings strong. We want to come out of these meet meetings and go higher. &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to live higher. &gt;&gt; You know what it mean? You know what you can do if you live higher? That means you can jump higher. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God never come to tell you not to jump. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, just don't jump higher than you're living." So, we received a message so we could live higher. So, we could jump higher. &gt;&gt; Well, you might like it, don't like it, but I like it because I'll jump for Jesus. &gt;&gt; That just might be a good old sermon title, jump for Jesus. You jump for the world, you might as well jump for Jesus. You might as well get excited for God. You might get You're going to get excited for something. Especially our young people. Young people are going to get excited about something. And we give them everything else to get excited about but the word of God. But I tell you, when you get a revelation, there's nothing else worth being excited for than Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. It is something worth to fellowship about, to get together about, to talk about, to testify about, to go camping about. I tell you what, it's it's it's worth it when Jesus Christ is in your midst. &gt;&gt; Prophet didn't come to quiet us down and to sit us down. He came for us to soar in heavenly places. And if you live higher, you can jump higher. &gt;&gt; Right? The prophet preached that getting in the spirit. I say, "Let's live in the spirit. If you if we if we're going to walk in the spirit, let's live in the spirit." &gt;&gt; So, brother Random goes on and shows how the great warrior Joshua led them into the promised land. And and so, they're no longer slaves living under the living and they're living under the blessings of God. And now they've come into the promised land and and and now they're going just through the through the cycle of living life and thy &gt;&gt; they're in the promised land and now you know but that they're there and and Joshua brought them in and now they're they're living a in a natural promised land. But the prophet of God shows he says then one day come the greatest warrior of them all the Lord Jesus the son of God. And he said there is a land where a man don't die. He said in in in paragraph 26, "Then on the day of Pentecost, he sent back the earnest of this place, the assurance, the evidence that this land is real." Just like Joshua brought back the evidence, Jesus brought back the evidence of the Holy Ghost. Now, we reckon ourselves dead. We're buried with him in baptism unto his death. And we raise with him in the resurrection. And now, we are in already, not we're going to be, we're already raised. Oh my. We are now not will be. We are now tonight sitting in heavenly places. How? In Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a promise to know that right now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That if that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the uh from the dead dwell in you, it will quicken your mortal body, you are a new creature, old things have passed away. All things have become new. Is there somebody here that knows what I'm talking about? Is there somebody that say, "Preacher, I know what you're talking about. I know what I I used to be, but then Jesus Christ got a hold of my life. And the creature that I once was is dead, and I have been changed. And I have been made alive in Jesus Christ." I say, "Sometimes on your worst days and on your down days, why don't you just start thinking about his grace? Why don't you start thinking about his mercy? Why don't you start thinking about, you know, where I once was, but then God reached down with his great mercy and he pulled me up out of the muck and mire of sin and he set me on the strong rock of revelation that I can never fall off that rock. So no matter how bad my day is and how good my day is, I am resting in his hands. I'm resting upon a promised word. &gt;&gt; Brother Baron said, "Religious religion is a covering, but salvation is freedom." Some of us just got religion. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, religion ain't no way to live. &gt;&gt; It kind of might make you feel good that you were able to cross your tees and dot your eyes, &gt;&gt; but it ain't liberty. &gt;&gt; It ain't freedom. Living by a moral code of conduct and and always having to remind yourself and and hearing the preacher or the word and come back again and and you're always constantly moving towards the edge. You're always constantly moving towards the fence. You're you're always constantly trying to keep the word to keep the letter. It's always the law I if it's no joy. It's no peace. I tell you that that that's there that's no way to live. &gt;&gt; That that's exactly what religion is and religious it's just a covering. But salvation is freedom. Does anybody know what it is? Oh. Oh. To be free, &gt;&gt; free from the world. &gt;&gt; Free from sin. free from unbelief. Free from from transgressing the word of God. Free from all the doubt. Free from all the unbelief and how Satan will come around. He'll try to lie to you and and try to tell you, you know, you're not going to make it. And you can just say, "Shut up, you old dumb devil. I ain't listening today. You might have talked me into thinking like that one time." But look, I am free. And whom the son has made free is free indeed. I ain't got no time for your negative thoughts. I ain't got no time or attention for you, devil. I'm not going to believe your report because what is the devil always trying to do? He's always trying to bring up an evil report. He's always trying to run you down. He's always trying to tell you how big the trial looks and how big the giants are. And what does he want you to do? He wants you to start giving him an ear so you might believe his report. But I ain't going to believe his report. I'm going to believe the report of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to maybe focus on something for a moment. Like I said, we won't be long tonight. Lord willing, just want to encourage you in something. But but Paul said in Ephesians 2:8, he said, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast." So it's not your good works. &gt;&gt; Help me out. Help me out. &gt;&gt; It's not your good works. &gt;&gt; It's not your efforts. It's not how much you can quote the Bible, &gt;&gt; not how many tapes you can listen to. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not how how much uh how much of a message theologian you can become. &gt;&gt; There's plenty of theologians out there. There's plenty of men who are studied and and know their Bible and and my I would tell you what, some of the the the people who hate this message study it more than some of us do. &gt;&gt; They hate it so bad. I mean, they they just they they they they're just trying to find something and and always trying to come up with something. Look, that's how the devil is. They're consumed with it. That's what you know, you know, that's how you keep a dumpster fire doing you. You got to keep looking for trash and that's all they can do is keep looking for trash and looking for heirs and looking for this and looking for that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it's not your good works. It's not your efforts. Brother Brandham said, "Now works are fine, but they don't save you. &gt;&gt; They don't make you perfect. It is Christ or perish. It is not even Christ and works. It is Christ alone." &gt;&gt; This is the Philadelphiaian church. As he said, "This age begin the years of our manyism that does not believe in Christ as the reality. It does not sing of nothing but the blood, for it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct." Now, if we're not careful, &gt;&gt; we allow the devil to start bringing an evil report where we start to measure the word of God by our conduct. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, Brother Brandon will hit this. We're not doing away with good conduct. &gt;&gt; But what we want to do is lay in the principle of the word that it's not your good works that save you. It's not your good works that make you perfect. Because as soon as you do anything, &gt;&gt; as soon as you make a mistake or as soon as you do anything, Satan's right there as an accuser to say, "Aha, &gt;&gt; you ain't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You didn't get nothing out of the meetings." &gt;&gt; If you were a real message believer, you would have never done that or said that or watched that or listened to that. &gt;&gt; And what is he trying to do? He's trying to move you off the promise &gt;&gt; and get you to start looking at your own conduct as an evidence &gt;&gt; when brother Red is clearly showing that this age came and it said nothing but the blood in my own conduct. Now I believe in good conduct. If you are saved you will do righteously. We have already gone over that. But let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus. &gt;&gt; It is Jesus alone. Salvation is of the Lord. &gt;&gt; From start to finish, it is all God. &gt;&gt; Let it be his life in me. Let it be his blood that cleanses me. Let it be his spirit that fills me. Let it be his word in my heart and mouth. Let it be his stripes that heal me. Let it be Jesus and Jesus alone. Not by works of righteousness which I have done. No, sir. Christ is my life. Can we establish that? That is not by our good works. I want to tell you, if your good works don't save you, then your bad works don't unsave you. &gt;&gt; I think I want to say that again. If your good works don't save you, &gt;&gt; your bad works don't unsave you. &gt;&gt; Because it was never based on your works. It was based on the grace of God. Let it be his blood that cleanses me. Let it be his spirit that fills me. Let it be his word in my heart and my mouth. Let it be his stripes that heal me. Let it be Jesus and Jesus alone, not by works of righteousness which I have done. Oh, is there somebody that wants to thank God for Calvary and thank God for his grace and thank God for his mercy. That salvation is of God and salvation is of the Lord. It is Jesus Christ and Jesus alone. It is not Jesus plus my good works because I would have messed it up a long time ago, but it is Jesus and Jesus alone. &gt;&gt; But that devil, watch him. He's always right there &gt;&gt; wanting to bring up an evil report. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; But we want to lay that in there as a foundation to show that salvation is of the &gt;&gt; how much you can be a good boy or girl. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And in our text right here in in in verse 28, Numbers 13:20, it says, "Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell on the land, and the cities are walled and very great. And moreover, we saw the children of Anoch there. The Amalocites dwell in the land of the south. And the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan. See what's see what's raising up. What are they doing? &gt;&gt; They're looking at the opposition. And many times when God does a work in your life &gt;&gt; and you have a real experience with the Lord or you come out from meetings and now you're going into the battle, &gt;&gt; the devil's right there to try to show you all the giants in the land and everything that you have to overcome and and maybe you come to the first test and you don't pass it. Well, I got news for you. Every son and daughter of God that comes to God must be tested. &gt;&gt; And they don't pass every test the first time. News &gt;&gt; flash, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're not perfect by your works. &gt;&gt; And just because you fell a touch doesn't mean you didn't have a real experience with God. &gt;&gt; But what happens is we start to listen to the evil report. &gt;&gt; And Satan's always there to bring up an evil report. Listen to what the prophet said in redemption by judgment. He said, "And everything without faith is sin. Unbelief is absolutely sin. Everything that's not of faith is not of God. You must believe. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can have faith is first see what God said about it. &gt;&gt; And then believe his word. That's the only way you can do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can do that. I'm so glad that all I have to do is find out what God said about it and [screaming] believe his word. Believe his report. &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can do it. &gt;&gt; That means there's no other way to do it. So Joshua and Caleb knew that God had promised and they come back and they wasn't afraid to say we can take it because they based their faith not upon what they saw but what they believed. &gt;&gt; We are believers. &gt;&gt; We believe the message of the hour. We believe Malachi 4:5. We believe that we can do all things through Christ that strengthens us. So I'm not not looking at mistakes. I'm not looking at failures. I'm not looking at what I see. I'm looking at the promised word. &gt;&gt; But what happens? We start looking at the giants in the land. We we start looking at the opposition. And then what happens is we get we stop looking at the promise and we start looking at our ability. &gt;&gt; Or we start looking at the symptoms and not God's promise. We we start to look at the opposition and not God's power, not God's promise. &gt;&gt; But the only way to do it is to look God look into God's word. &gt;&gt; Believe that God said it. &gt;&gt; That's the only way that you can do it. So, exactly what Caleb and Joshua here the here the other people, they're coming up saying there ain't no way, you know, and and I kind of it kind of struck me a while back here. Here Joshua and Caleb, they go over there and they're going through the land and they're taking inventory. Yeah. You know, Joshua and Caleb walk in the land of and Caleb's over there going, "Look at that mountain. I want that mountain. That is going to be an awesome mountain because God give me the land. I want that mountain right there. And the other guys are walking by going, "Whoa, man. Get us away from that mountain. Can you see all the giants on that thing?" &gt;&gt; Here. They're in the same place and the 10 spies, they're doing inventory completely different. &gt;&gt; Like, man, this is not a good place to be. There's no way. And Joshua and Caleb are walking through the land saying, "My goodness, give me I'll take that one. I'll take that one. I'll take this one over there." Because what were they doing? They weren't looking at the opposition. They were looking at the promise. &gt;&gt; In verse 30, it says, "And Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it." I I wonder, do we got some Joshua and Caleb's here tonight? Has some people come back from from the meetings and we've come back to the house of God and we know we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and regardless of the excuses regardless of the giants that are in the land regardless of how bad it looks and how dark lady sea it is. We can look into God's divine promise and say I don't care how bad it looks. I don't care how dark it gets. I know that God has given me a promise and I am more than able to take the land. Regardless of the complaining, regardless of the excuses, regardless of everybody else walking away from the message, regardless of people compromising on the word of God and maybe preachers compromising on the word of God and people compromising on how they dress and what they listen to and and how they conduct themselves. But as for me in my house, we will serve the Lord. I will not make no excuse what I see in the message of the hour. I believe that God has come to perform his word in me and I got my eyes on the promise and I am more than able to do it. And what did Joshua and Caleb say? They said, "Let us go up at once." I say, "There ought to be something raising up in your heart right now." Say, "Let us go up right now." I'm not going to wait for Sunday. I'm not going to wait for Friday. I want to go right now. I want to take God in every promise. Take God in everything that he's promised. We're well more able to take the land. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are well more able to take the land. Let us go up at once. And in possessing all things, this is the message that brother Brandham's actually referring to um that he's now uh bringing out uh preaching in a conflict between God and Satan. He's referring to when he preached possessing all things at the tabernacle. a when he struck this thought and after he struck the thought on the evidence of salvation, he said he went home and was just pacing back and forth. And so I I I got into that message and he says just what Joshua did for the children of Israel. Joshua means savior. The word Joshua and that's the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. And he rose up again with the evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost that there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. Amen. He come back and brought us the evidence. What does it do, brother Brandham? It makes you stop your lying, stealing, drinking, cursing, immorals, everything. It makes a new creature out of you. I who was once dead in sin and trespasses, nevertheless, I live, not me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to the promise. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That land belongs to us. How do you know it? Joshua rose from the dead, brought back the evidence of the Holy Ghost, and I got it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. A child of the king. A child of the king. Heir to all things. The Bible said. So look, we are possessors of all things. We've been given a promise. &gt;&gt; How do you know? I got the evidence. I got the proof. &gt;&gt; He rose from the dead and brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost. And I got it. &gt;&gt; I said he rose from the dead and he came back with the evidence and I got it. Is there somebody here that can say, "I got it." &gt;&gt; Is there a young person here that can say, "I got it. He rose from the dead on the third day and he came back with the evidence and I got it." Oh, I want to say if there was ever something to shout about, if there was ever something to scream about, if there was ever something to be thankful for, if there was ever something to talk about is to say, "I got it. &gt;&gt; I got the Holy Ghost. I got the evidence. I got the proof of his resurrection. I got [screaming] it. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll give somebody here to say, I got it. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that's worth talking about. &gt;&gt; That's worth living for. &gt;&gt; That's worth something getting excited for. Look, we come out of meetings, is everybody charged or we already right back down? &gt;&gt; Bang. Didn't take long. Monday came and bang. Hey, sometimes it happens. But I'm so glad we're not looking at how we feel. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Every time you get a victory, you just watch, the devil's right there. &gt;&gt; Every time you get a victory, every time you go to go to church meetings, every time something happens, every time you get a blessing, the devil's going to be right there. &gt;&gt; You come into a test, you're going to come into a trial." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, even a matter of fact, I think it's in that same sermon, conflict between God and Satan. says it just watch out. You're going to go have a have a meeting or have something and God's going to bless you and then all of a sudden you're going to go right into a hard time. It just happens every single time. Some of you been wondering why Monday was so hard. Now you know. &gt;&gt; Some of you wondering why it was so hard to get to church on a Wednesday like now you know. &gt;&gt; He goes, "Well, the devil's always there trying to bring up an evil report. He's always trying to rob you of what God done for you." &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell you, it's just an opportunity to kick that dude in the face. Forgive me for being so graphic, but I don't like that devil and I don't like his lies. And every time he tries to come around and run his mouth, I just want to take the word and hit him with the word. Look, that's what the prophet of God told us to do in the greatest battle ever fought. You hit him with the word. And if he don't move, what do you do? Hit him again. &gt;&gt; Why do you do that? Hit him again. Hit him again. Hit him. Hit him with that word. &gt;&gt; Keep hitting them. said until you peek yourself out of the shell like the eagle that you are and then say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where's the next one? &gt;&gt; That's how we ought to show up to church. &gt;&gt; But you know what, man? I had to chop up some demons on the way here. But glory to God, I showed up. Where's the next one? Oh, I see a little cloud over there hanging on my brother or sister. Let's get to praying. Let Let's break off the heavy bands. Let's get this cloud off the tabernacle. Some people have had a hard time. They've had a hard week. They come through Monday. They come through Tuesday. Brother Billy had to work the whole song service by himself practically. The musicians are wondering why it's a hard time. The preacher can hardly get anywhere. Well, maybe there's just a cloud hanging over the tab. But you know what? We are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus. We can go into faith. We can go into action. We can go into prayer and say, "Devil, you ain't going to get the victory. You're not going to win this battle. We are the sons and daughters of Almighty God. We come here to worship the Lord. We come here to praise our God. We come here to get the victory. We are more than able to do it. Let us go up at once. Let's chase every demon of doubt. Let's chase every fear. Let's chase every anxiety. Let's chase every away thing away from these believing children that have come to the house of God that they can be free to praise him. Free to worship them. Free to lift up their hands and say, "Praise [screaming] the Lord Jesus. Thank you for the victory. Thank you for life. Thank you for salvation. Thank you for saving me. Thank you for giving me my family. I know my son and my daughter might be out in the world, but Lord Jesus, I am a possessor of all things, the seen and the unseen. And I claim my baby girl. I claim my son in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan, you can't have them. You take your hands off of God's property. Take them. Take your hands off of the children of God. I am heir of all things. I am more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. We come with a faith like that. you start doing battle, start hitting that old devil with the There's no telling what God can do in a meeting like this if we'll just let our faith rise up beyond beyond our complexes and beyond who's behind the pulpit and who and our fears and and our wants and our desires and and what we think we want and what we think how things should be and just get into a heavenly place with Christ Jesus and say, "Lord Jesus, just have your will and way in me. I want to love you. I want to worship you. I want to praise you. Lord, may it be like a day of Pentecost where a rushing mighty wind might just sweep through the building. May it change hearts and change lives. Lord, may it deliver the bondage and the things that the children of God are going through. Lord, we haven't come here to play church. We've come here to see you, Lord. We've come here to see a God that's more than Abel. The same God of Isaac and Jacob and Abraham. The same God that was with Paul. The same God that was with John. The same God that was with Peter. He's the same God that was with brother Brandham. He's the same God that's right here in the tabernacle tonight. If we can just release our cares, release our desires, release our wants, and let the living God come down your aisle. &gt;&gt; I got [screaming] it. &gt;&gt; I got the evidence. &gt;&gt; I got the Holy [screaming] Ghost. &gt;&gt; Some of us got more excited when we got our first car. I I was about to say some of us got more excited when we got our braces off, but I don't blame you. &gt;&gt; You feel like your mouth is finally free. &gt;&gt; But we get excited about things in the natural. &gt;&gt; I get excited about the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because I got [screaming] it. See, if you ain't got it, there ain't nothing to be excited about. &gt;&gt; But when you got it, &gt;&gt; you know, we all get excited about maybe going on vacations and everything. &gt;&gt; We might get excited about we were we were promised something and all the expectation and all the anxiety and all the waiting to get there, but when you finally got it, Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; I got it. And you know what I love about the Holy Ghost, Brother Orlando? &gt;&gt; Ain't no devil. Ain't no demon. Ain't no mistake. There ain't no failure. There's nothing that I can do that nothing can ever take it away from me. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; It's the evidence. It's the down payment. &gt;&gt; You know, that's what the that's what the Holy Ghost is. was the down payment &gt;&gt; to let you know there is a land beyond the river. &gt;&gt; We call the sweet forever. And if you got it, you're going. &gt;&gt; I said if you got it, you're going. So it really don't matter if your house is big or your house is small. If your car [screaming] runs or you don't your car don't run. If you got the Holy Ghost, you got everything because you are possessors. If you don't ever get to Italy on this side, it's already [screaming] yours. You own it. That should be a reality. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all didn't even know that &gt;&gt; you own it. &gt;&gt; Ju just go back to school. Go back to work and say, "Did you know that I own Italy? &gt;&gt; It's mine. Like what are you? God gave it to me. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Well, you turn over here. It's in my Bible somewhere. [snorts] Galatians Galatians 3 verse 29. And if you be Christ, then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise. &gt;&gt; I'm heir to all things. &gt;&gt; I'm actually heir to the things seen &gt;&gt; and the things you can't see. And we don't even know what the Lord has in store for us. &gt;&gt; So when I say I got it, I really don't even know what I got. But I'm glad I got it &gt;&gt; because I know if the prophet of God said if what we got would make us this happy down here, &gt;&gt; wait till we get up there. How happy we'll be. Well, I'm just going to tell you what, I'm not going to wait to walk the streets of gold to shout and to praise God. I'm going to start it right now cuz I already got my ticket. I already got it. Look, people when they win bingo and they win the lottery, they don't wait to get excited. When they got the winning ticket, they say, "I got [screaming] it. I got it." They call their friends, they call their mama, they call their brothers. And you don't got to work no more. You don't have to worry about anything. Why? What are you talking about? I won [screaming] the lottery. I got the winning numbers. Well, is there people here on a Wednesday night? You might have not won the lottery. You might not have a million dollars, but you got the evidence of the Holy Ghost shot up in your bone. You're a possessor of all things of heaven and earth, things seen and unseen. And you want to say, "I got it." [screaming] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I once was lost, &gt;&gt; but now I'm found. I once was blind, [screaming] &gt;&gt; but now I see. &gt;&gt; I'm not re rejoicing because devils are subject to me. I'm rejoicing because my name is written in heaven. I came from God and I'm going back to God. &gt;&gt; But brother Matthew, I don't feel really well. I actually feel terrible. Sounds like you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; What? Yeah. Christians go through hard times. &gt;&gt; They go through struggles. They go through heartaches. But it don't it's not based on how you feel. &gt;&gt; It's not based on what you see. It's based on what he said and if you believe. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God said in end time signed. He said when the word came to Mary, she never doubted it. She said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; I'll just read it. It's fine, brothers. Be Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word. See, she never said, "Now you wait till I feel life and then I'll go testify. You wait till I'm positive of it. That's the way we Christians so-called today do. &gt;&gt; Wait till I'm positive. Wait till I begin to get better. &gt;&gt; Wait till I see something happen and then I'll do it. No, sir. That's not the question. &gt;&gt; You believe first. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would go on and say that's exactly what happened to Elijah with with the the with the widow woman. He said, "Go bake me a cake first." He said, "You put the word first, then watch the miracle." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the question isn't if you feel it. The question is if you believe. That's exactly what he had to teach John Ryan. John Ryan came through and he said, "So you you you he goes, I believe." He goes, "Okay, you're healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." John Ryan was blind. He come back and said, "I thought you said I was healed." He said, "I thought you said you believe." He said, "I do believe this. Then go testify." He didn't walk off the platform said, "That's just a false prophet." He said, "I was healed and I can't even see a thing." But John Ryan was a real believer. He went down to his work. He went down to his job. He actually sat back up in the church. And he actually, as the word was going forth, he said, "Praise [screaming] God, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; Preacher went on a little bit longer and he was just sitting there. He said, "Praise [screaming] God, I'm healed." The ushers or or the deacons were actually looking to brother Brandham because they were going to go shut tell him to be quiet. And brother Brandham, you know what he said? He said, "Just leave him alone." You see, sometimes it's okay to get out of order if you're going to get saved. Sometimes it's okay to get out of order if you're going to get the blessing. Sometimes it's just all right. Here's a prophet saying, "Let the man testify." He didn't get healed there in the meeting. He didn't get healed maybe the next day, but one day he was sitting in that barber chair and the world and all them were scoffing and making fun of him and say, "Listen to this old guy. He thinks he's going in a rapture. He thinks he's going in a body change. He thinks he's the bride of Jesus Christ. He thinks in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, he's going to be changed." And he said, "Praise [screaming] God, I'm healed." And his eyes come open. He come running out the barber shop and down the street with with shaving cream flying off his face. And here come the barber with a razor in his hand saying, "Wait, come back." [screaming] Why? Because he took God at his word. Put the word first, then watch the miracle. The question is is, "Do you believe?" [screaming] &gt;&gt; I try to just move quickly and in along these lines. I want you to act like you've it's your first time to ever hear this. &gt;&gt; We've heard that said before &gt;&gt; because sometimes things just become so common. And I'm going to read some really familiar stuff, but we're talking about whose report are you going to believe? &gt;&gt; Are you going to keep listening to the evil report that raises up? And and you'd be surprised that evil report doesn't uh it may it maybe doesn't come how you would think. &gt;&gt; It might come in a temptation. It might come pulling on your flesh. It might want you to listen to something or to like something or to give in something you've been delivered from or you've been believing to be delivered from. But if you allow that negativity, you don't want your flesh that you're bringing into subjection to take sides with that evil report. What you want to do is you want to rebuke that thing. Say, "Devil, I don't want nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; You're going to try to tempt me to listen to worldly music. I'm going to praise the Lord. I I'm going to listen to a tape. I'm going to read my Bible. And if you realize you got a little too far and you already gave in, you know what to do. Don't finish the song. &gt;&gt; Say, "What in the world am I doing? Lord Jesus, forgive me. I have fallen again. I plead the blood of Jesus Christ. Lord, give me the strength next time this old lion devil evil report wants to come around and try to tell me I even like this stuff. I don't like it, Lord. And if there's something in me that likes it, take it out of me because I want to be more like you, Lord Jesus. I'm not going to listen to the evil report. I'm going to listen to what you said in your word. I am more than a conqueror in Jesus Christ. I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. You start looking at the promised word. Quit looking at how you got off sides. Quit looking at how it got your attention. Quit looking at the giants. Quit looking at all the things out there and start looking at the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says an invisible union says the real genuine eagles hear &gt;&gt; my sheep know my voice. &gt;&gt; A stranger they they'll not follow. Why? It was put in there by predestination. &gt;&gt; You were fore orained &gt;&gt; to a son of God. &gt;&gt; You were in God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That never gets old to me. I want to run around the church right now. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing his report? &gt;&gt; What he said about you? &gt;&gt; You were for ordained to be a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world world. &gt;&gt; Devil, you lose, I win. &gt;&gt; Cuz I was before you were. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm eternal. I'm as eternal as God was et as is eternal. &gt;&gt; That means I can no more fail than God can fail. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You are in God before the foundation. You're only manifested in this day &gt;&gt; for his honor and glory. &gt;&gt; How can you do do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God? Yes, sir. which you are a part of that word by predestination because look the God is the word you believe it &gt;&gt; well then if he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the word was God then you were in God &gt;&gt; the word the part that you're you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world he seen you he knew you he predestinated you to it You notice how he said the part that you play. &gt;&gt; Look, look what he said. He said the word the part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You're just manifested in this day and age to play your part. &gt;&gt; Now, I was thinking about that and I got preaching on that a little while ago. The part that you played. And I got to thinking about our church here. You know, one time we did a church play [snorts] and we and we, you know, we all picked out of all of our parts and everything and I and I always remember I believe Brother Towanda played the palm tree. Yeah. Everybody had a everybody had to play a part. Maybe it was you, brother Billy. I can't remember. It was somebody. Somebody had to play a palm tree. Somebody had to play the camels. Somebody had to play Isaac and Rebecca. Somebody had to play all these parts, right? But they were picked and they were given a script. And then when it came time for everybody to play out their part, they knew how they were to dress. They knew how they were to act. [snorts] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing with you. God chose you to play your part. [screaming] [applause] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times you pick out uh uh parts you because you know I remember I I I mentioned this at at Louisiana camp some years ago. Uh they did a play on David and Goliath. It was just a little play that was thrown together real fast. And so they needed a big tall guy. And of course they chose El brother Eli Arbaggast. You know, he was big old tall brother and he was going to be Goliath. And then they they chose they chose uh some some brother, you know, to be David. And then, you know, they needed a rock. Well, it just so happens that they chose Ma uh brother Matt Morris to be the rock. And I was thinking about that and I text him. I was like, man, I was just thinking about that how we did that play a long time ago and how, you know, uh you were the rock. And he texted me back and said, "Somebody had to do it." And actually got inspired. Hallelujah. Praise God. Somebody had to do it. And somebody had to be an overcomer in Lady Oia. Somebody had to look the part, act the part. And God chose you. You were actually that part in his mind before the world was ever formed. And he actually wrote out the whole script and he actually chose you. He knew how tall you would be. He knew how short you would be. He knew how wide you would be. He knew if you'd be prettier or you didn't think you were pretty. Look, I want to tell you, some of us got complexes and things hanging over our life. We don't think we're pretty enough. We don't think we're tall enough. We think we're all those things. That is a lying devil from the pits of hell. Look, if that be the truth with a nose this big, I should have given up a long time ago. But God knew exactly how big my nose would be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, sometimes you got to make it funny because some people really wrestle with complexes and they they wish they didn't look the way they looked and they wish they were taller and they wish they weren't this this way and that way and and they hate the way they look. That is a lie from the pits of hell. God chose you. He ordained you. He wanted you to show up looking exactly the way you showed up. You are the very mind of God and thoughts of God. He said, "I want that one here in this day because just as Satan came into my Eden in the beginning and disrupted everything, I'm going to send my bride in the evening time and she's going to disrupt and tear down the gates of hell. I have chosen you for a part. It's time to play your part, church." &gt;&gt; Well, come on. &gt;&gt; You got the best part. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You got the lead role. &gt;&gt; You know, every time we, you know, somebody does a song special or something, it's like, well, why why do they have to be the lead or why they have to do this? You know what? We all have a part to play. &gt;&gt; But he chose all of us to be the main character in the end time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He only has our hands as we yield our hands. &gt;&gt; He only has feet as we yield our feet. He only has a mouth as we yield our mouth. Where is Christ? &gt;&gt; He's in the bride. He's playing out his part through his bride. &gt;&gt; I say it's time to play our part. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll move quickly through these last quotes. We got to play our part. And we have to recognize that God chose you and picked you. Hand selected. Said, "I want you just the way you are &gt;&gt; and I want you to play this part." He knew [clears throat] the whole family tree. &gt;&gt; He knew when you would be born and all of the things about your life. He knew the struggles. He knew the heartache. He knew everything that you would come through. What does he do? He's building you into the stature of a perfect man. Now, I could skip a few scriptures here, but you know, we know all things work together. I'll just read it really quick. Romans 8:28. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, &gt;&gt; to them who are called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Now, now listen to this. These are these are scriptures that I I want to read again. You fight with this. You fight with the word of God, &gt;&gt; the sword of the spirit. How did Jesus overcome? It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; He taught us how to fight. So that when you're in the valley or you're going through the hard time, my Bible tells me, moreover, from whom he did predestinate them, he also called. Has God called you? &gt;&gt; Is there somebody has God called you? &gt;&gt; I'm going try to do quick math here. About half of us. Has God called you? &gt;&gt; I'm talking to everybody. Has God called you? &gt;&gt; There's somebody that wants to testify. Say, God called me. &gt;&gt; God call you? Did God call you? &gt;&gt; God call you. that if God has called you, my Bible tells me who he's called, he's also justified. And whom he's justified, them, he is also glorified. &gt;&gt; And the evil report is always raising up to begile you of the evidence. &gt;&gt; Well, no, you know, it you really can't. It's too big. It's too hard. You'll never get total victory. You're always going to struggle. You're always going to go through these things. Look, if if if you come to that place, you repent of your sins, you say, "Lord, I may be fail again. I thought I had victory over this thing, but Lord, I know one thing. You called me. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you who started the work, you're just and faithful to finish it. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to get my eyes back on the promise. &gt;&gt; I'm going to quit looking at looking at how I got off track. And I'm going to look back at the word." So, this is where I just want to end on these couple quotes because I I I just want to what was on my heart was just to take a moment to have us believe his report. &gt;&gt; Invisible union. He the bridegroom took away your shame. You can put that up, brothers. Paragraph 262. Invisible union. He the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness. by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. Your first husband that you are married to the world, the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water. &gt;&gt; Now, I like to take some time right there, but I won't. But you know that that first nature, that's your first husband that has to die. Paul said, "I die daily." When you're born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, that first nature, that's what you were you first married to. Brother Brandon saying your first husband that you were married to the world, the anointed bridegroom which fordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church, by your good works, by by how many times you went to church in a row. &gt;&gt; No. What does he say? No, that don't sound right. You might find that in the almanac, but not in God's Bible. By the washing of the water by the word in the word. You are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning. I I I say what a report. &gt;&gt; What a report. &gt;&gt; What a message. Now, has it become so common to us that that it just we just breeze right over it? We've just heard it so many times that ought to produce such a love in us for the Lord. &gt;&gt; That if he did that for us, we'll serve him with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; We'll want to have good works. &gt;&gt; We'll want to abstain from evil, the appearance of evil. He says, "You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God." Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You're perfect. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask the musicians to come. That evil report's always trying to offer you something that the word didn't say you were. I say, "I want to believe his report. &gt;&gt; I I I I'm I'm done listening to the devil. I'm done with his lies." He does care. &gt;&gt; He does want you to give him all your heart. I like how Brother Brandham said, "The only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are." Have faith in what the word says you are. And I'll just end on this. This was kind of my inspiration here. Out of Christ, the mystery of God revealed. Brother brother brother Tom just ended uh he was ending his sermon and ending the meetings uh with these quotes right here. Brother Brandham says this in 594 says, "Justified in his sight." Why are we justified? We are his victory. The church is his victory. We come forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory. &gt;&gt; You, &gt;&gt; you are the proof &gt;&gt; of his victory. &gt;&gt; You are the proof of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You are the proof of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; You are the proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see his coming down and living among the church, that's his victory. Shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave. Neither can he keep us. That's right. We are we are bound, right? And we're already potentially arised because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal God which is in himself working through us, manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That's his report. &gt;&gt; That's the report I'm going to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. I am his victory. &gt;&gt; Why don't we all stand? &gt;&gt; Oh, that devil, he comes around and he starts to [music] to bring up the evil report and tries to start telling you all of those things. My Bible says, "Arise and shine, for the glory of the Lord has risen upon you." I said, "Arise and shine. Rise out of the muck and mire of Lady Osia. You're not in the chicken yard anymore. You're seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You got your eyes on the promise. I am the proof of his resurrection. I am his victory. We got the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; Couldn't keep him in the grave. He can't keep us in the grave. Why? Because I got it. I got the evidence. I might make a misstep. I might fall. But I'm going to get right back up again because my eyes are on the promise. I am going in a rapture. I'm going in a body change. I don't care if I have a good day, bad day, no day, up, down day. It doesn't matter. Why? Because I got my eyes on the promise of God. I am what he said I am. I am the very proof of his resurrection. I am his victory. I say that ought to make you act different. That ought to make you live different. That ought to make you talk different. Why don't we just bow our heads? Lord Jesus, we love you. We're thankful that we could be in your presence, Lord, just to come one more time and gather around your word, Lord. I know it's just a simple sermon. We just wanted to [music] encourage the people to believe your report, Lord. Lord, when we can catch that revelation of justification, that we never did it in the first place, that we're justified. Lord, that kind of love, that kind of redemption. Lord, it sets us free from our our [music] past and we don't have to worry about mistakes and failures. Lord, it gives us the confidence and the reassurance and the faith to know that we can do all things through Christ that strengthens us. That we can just keep our eye on the promise and know that we're being built up in the stature of a perfect man. that this is the hour of adoption and the placing of sons and we don't have to worry about old baggage and wonder [music] if we've been forgiven or wrestle with if we're good enough. Lord, you said that we're perfect. Then Lord, if you said we're perfect, Lord, I'm going to believe your report. Lord, I won't listen to that evil report that raises up and tries to pull me away from your promised word. Lord, I'm just going to surrender to your word that you can have the preeminence. Lord, I love you. Just thank you for your word. [music] Just ask your blessings on the people now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. I've been liking that song. I wasn't made to be tended in a grave. I was called by name. Let's try to sing that. I need help with this song. I know who I am cuz I know who you are. The cross of [music] salvation was only the start. [music] Now I am chosen. Free [music] and forgiven. I have a [music and singing] future and it's worth [music] living. I wasn't made [music and singing] to be taken in a grave. I was called by name. Born and raised [music] back to life again. I was made. So [music] why would [singing] I lay a bed in my shame when a fountain of [music and singing] grace was running my way? I know I am yours and I was made for more. [music] I know [singing] who I am. Cuz [music] I know who you are. The cross [music and singing] of salvation was only strong. Now I'm [music] chosen, free and forgiven. [music] I have a future [music] and it's worth living. I was made [music] to be dead in the grave. I was called by name, born and [music] raised back to life again. I was made [music] for more. So why would I make [music] a bed in my shame when a fountain of grace is running my [music and singing] way? I know I am yours I was made for. [music] I know who I am. [music] I know who you are. The cross of salvation [music] was [singing] only the strong. Now I am [music] free and I have a future [music] and it's worth living. Oh sing with all your heart. Oh, and [music and singing] I was made to be tending grave. I was [music] called [singing] by born back to life again. I was [music] ready to go. Why would I [music] make my shame when I found your grace running my [music and singing] way? I know I am yours. I was faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that. Don't you? I was made for more. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Now, wasn't that wonderful tonight? Praise the Lord. Just that should just lift your spirits right up. In fact, that was so good. I'm going to repreach it Sunday morning &gt;&gt; and I'm going to have a different title. I'm going to call it faith in the accusation. &gt;&gt; Same message because God's wanting us to hear it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God's wanting it to sink in. Yes, sir. [music] &gt;&gt; You know, when you teach something, &gt;&gt; this is how you teach it. You tell them what you're going to tell them. &gt;&gt; You tell them &gt;&gt; and then you tell them what you told them. &gt;&gt; Now, Matthew told you what he's going to tell you. I'm going to tell it again Sunday and somebody's going to come and tell it to again until we get to the place that we quit listening to the devil. &gt;&gt; Just that simple. &gt;&gt; Let's pray for brother Matthew. He's going this weekend uh to uh Arkansas, right? Brother Jason Jackson. Preaching for brother Jason Jackson. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; May that word that he maybe that's on his heart. I I I was hoping you would have shared that with us out of that uh AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want you to listen to this. You got one second. You can you got to hear this. This is good. [music] Let's sit down. Just five minutes. Come here and share this. No, this this excites me. But anyway, that's just me. Forgive me. I you know I'm I'm 76. I'm entering into my second childhood and and I got a scripture for it. So unless you become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. But anyway, this go just take it right there. &gt;&gt; You got you got me. Here we go. All right. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; So, let me see if I can uh um I I I just, you know, don't don't get too far out on this, but it's it's sometimes you want to see what's out there. So I I asked chat GBT, did William Brandon preach the truth? And he and and and this is it it actually came up and it said whether William Brandon preached the truth depends on what you mean by truth and which standard you measure him by. People generally fall into three categories. &gt;&gt; Those who believe he preached the truth. Amen. The believer &gt;&gt; those who be those who believed he did not preach the well the other one is those who pre believe he preached the truth and some truth &gt;&gt; make believers those who believe he did not preach the truth but this is what blew my mind but here's the real question for you Matthew are you asking because you're wrestling with doubts you want confirmation of what you already believe you're comparing what he taught with scripture. You want an objective historical answer. Your motive changes how I should answer you. &gt;&gt; I thought, "Wow." &gt;&gt; Well, I'll let you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that something? So, he asked AI and he said, "Well, it depends. Do you believe?" There's three categories of people. &gt;&gt; People that believe everything he says. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the believer, &gt;&gt; right? People that don't listen to nothing &gt;&gt; else. &gt;&gt; People that believe some of what he says is true &gt;&gt; and some isn't lukewarm &gt;&gt; make believer &gt;&gt; and some that don't believe anything he says at all. &gt;&gt; Unbeliever that come out of a robot. We don't want no unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand back up again cuz now I'll get to preaching. Amen. I I I I like that. That that that's so good. We've got a a a fabulous land that is ours. You know what we call that land? It's called the promised land. &gt;&gt; The land of promise. I am bound for the promised land. I We're all bound for the promised land. And the deeper we enter into the promised land, the more promises we find out that are there for us. And the more promises we have, the more we can take those promises and do what brother Matthew says and just kick them in the teeth, hit them with promise after promise after promise. Brother Bram says in he said state Satan come in in greatest battle ever fought he said Satan come in like a bunch of stormtroopers you know ready to take the country and he said the word of God cut them to rivens let's take the promises of God and let's sing this for our dismissal song I am bound for the promised land amen how many is bound for the promised land doesn't matter that we're standing on stormy Jordan dank It doesn't matter. We got a wishful eye. We're going somewhere. I made for more. I'm gonna become more. &gt;&gt; I There's victory for me to have. It's prophesied for me to have it. I'm going to go forward and believe it. I'm going to believe what is promised to me.
