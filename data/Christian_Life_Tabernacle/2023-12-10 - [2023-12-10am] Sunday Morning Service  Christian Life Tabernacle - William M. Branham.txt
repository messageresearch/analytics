Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
December 10, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you have your Bibles let's turn over to the gospel of St Luke and we want to read uh the second chapter of Luke starting with the eth uh uh verse and read a few scriptures you know I I uh I always enjoy when somebody announces the birth of a baby they always want to tell how much it weighs and and you know how long it was and all that well you know I one day I just a long time ago I said that you know why you know I was talking to lesie I says you know why do they make such a big deal about how big it is and how long it is and everything and she looks at me she says well what do you do when you catch a fish you're always telling everybody how big it is and how much it weighs and how long it is well I tell you she got me there right so sisters congratulations that's all I can say I I understood then what a feat that it is you know we'll never understand that sisters but without you none of us would have been here so that's how important you are to the Lord so uh I just thought if any other brothers ever had the that question you might as well put it to rest right now you love them this morning amen amen I just thought with our little Christmas program I'd maybe try to have a Christmas message this morning uh God is certainly good to us amen just to think that he came is marvelous but let us just read these scriptures and and uh I I love those uh songs Christmas songs people you know they be because of the world has taken Christmas and turned it into a Santa Claus I'm not going to let their perversion rob me of my joy you know what I mean I I I I want the joy of the Lord to be my portion so there there there's no need let and all the commercial side of it and all that keep it's a time I love it's a time people are friendly one to another it's a time that people do good things and they give and and never say stop anything from good from happening you know always good things produce good things so I'm happy for this time of year amen and it says and there were in the same we know the beginning of the story that King uh that Caesar Augusto wanted to collect taxes and he was sent a decree that everybody should return to the town where he was born he was taking a great census he wanted to keep track of all the people uh all his Fame and Fortune and what he was worth and uh he didn't realize he was worth nothing but uh and so he he made the decree and we know that Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem and they could find no room in the end and so that he ended up in a manger and uh and um and then we pick up the story he says and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddle clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the in there's hardly any room for him in the world anymore and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord come unto them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David his savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddle in clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them unto Heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and and found Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in the manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word just this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated what a uh tremendous event I I could certainly beyond the shadow of a doubt say with confidence in my heart that was probably the greatest historical event that had taken place up to that time amen possibly the greatest historical event that has taken place I would say probably next to the Resurrection The Coming of a savior into the world and we we as we follow this story and we talk about the shepherd words and what was transpiring all these great things took place but yet so few people even recognized it or saw it even though there were signs and you know that God gives signs he gives signs to uh to attract the people he give signs that people can to to know what is coming because with every sign there's a voice that follows the sign in other words there's a message behind the sign uh like even a road sign a sign is given to attract the attention of the people you're driving down the road and you see that sign that sits on the side of the road and it it'll be a a swervy sign sort of looks like a little snake now that's the sign that to catch your attention but the voice behind that sign is there's a curvy road ahead slow down else you will find yourself in the ditch so the sign was to attract your attention but there was a voice behind the sign or if I could use the instead of maybe the word voice uh another words a sign is trying to tell you something that's why we say a voice that's what a voice does a voice cries out to try to tell you something it's trying to get to you a message it's trying to attract your attention to something that is happening or is fixing to happen uh it it doesn't want you to ignore the signs because ignoring the sign is going to uh bring the judgments of the warning of the voice in other words a stop sign it tells you to stop you know the that that's the the sign to attract your attention to stop the voice behind that sign is that there's there will be oncoming traffic or or that you have to uh give way to something else and so if you if you totally ignore that sign and you don't hear the message that that sign is giving you you will end up with the judgment of that sign so that sign has a reason in other words it's trying to reach you and you notice that when you uh are driving that nobody else in the car is responsible they might feel the result of you not keeping the advice or the message of the sign but you're responsible for the sign so you're individually responsible for seeing the sign obeying the sign and hearing the voice behind the sign you can't pass that off onto somebody else you can't say well let's turn to the back seat you know and say well why didn't you tell me because you took the responsibility of sitting in the driver's seat you took the responsibility of of of starting and that car up and moving that car down the road and along with that you have a responsibility and you're obl obligated to that responsibility you get in a wreck and and they're not going to ticket the backseat driver I mean I've had a lot of backseat drivers I'd like to have ticketed but uh they're not going to ticket the backseat driver right they're not going to ticket the passenger but you've got to Bear the responsibility of that and so this morning we have to understand it's an individual Affair you've got to Bear the the the responsibility of the the decision that you made to drive and and we have to bear the responsibility of the decision that we've made to identify ourselves with the gospel amen you know you just can't say that you're a Christian and then ignore the word of God there's a responsibility that comes with with carrying the license if I could say that a of a Christian right you know it's it it's better uh uh not even to profess it the prophet of God and describing the woman at the well she said she knew the word but she wasn't living it she knew it but she wasn't living it therefore she didn't make the POS profession as if she was living it she had a lot of hidden character and so we we understand that it knowing that that God gives signs and he tries to give a sign so that the people uh will will it'll attract their attention and and bring to them the realization that there's something that they should be looking for that's right amen so when you pull to a stop sign what do you do you look for oncoming traffic you you it it it brings you into a a a in heighted uh awareness of the the circumstances are different than they were just immediately before you got the sign right so you understand that God gives signs and the sign is to create within you a reaction is to create within you an understanding it's to create within you an awareness it it it it's a signs are gifts of God to his people that's right and so we find out in the scripture that that the people in that day those Shepherds and all those people were living in the day of of the Fulfillment of a sign now whether they understood it or not or recognized it or not what depended a lot on what they took heed to but so we find out that those angels were a sign they showed up in the heavens and they begin to speak to the those Shepherds and they said this will be a sign to you you'll go to this place and find a baby in a Manger now that in itself was extremely unusual yes but that there was no place for that baby to be born because scripture had to be fulfilled amen the word of God was coming to pass whether or not anybody was aware of it or not but the sign to the Shepherds made them aware of it amen and they went and they found it just as the word of God said that it would be how many things today do we find just the same as the word of God said that they would be that's right and so we find out that these wise men were a sign that these Angels were a sign and they went and we find out that that this sign these Shepherds were moved upon and they went and found it as the angel said and they they put it abroad throughout all the country and all that heard it wondered but just think how many of them looked how many of them stayed with it how many were wondering what was this what with I wonder how many made inquiry uh of what took place they were living in the day of the Fulfillment of the sign they were actually living under the Fulfillment of Prophecy and were unaware Ware of what was transpiring right around them the Savior God himself had come down from heaven created a body and now was living with men so that he he could that he could uh actually uh could be a high priest that could be touched by the feelings of our infirmity that that we could have a Kinsman Redeemer someone that knows what it's like to be tempted in every way that you are tempted how many times do we go to the Lord I I was just thinking about it in my office you know all the things that are wrong with me and all the things I want to change and and you know I'm Irish so I'm a little hot-headed and and all my nature that I want to be different and I just struck me this morning that you know what uh he's a high priest that but these infirmities that I feel he can be touched by them yes my weaknesses my my failures in my flesh he can be touched by those things he he he knows what it feels like he knows what it feel like to have the the pull of the of the uh of the Flesh and the the the uh the women of the world and all that pull and and and the pull of of riches and wealth and the pull of wanting to to be in style all those things he he felt those things he fought those things he he wared against those things he had that same battle in his flesh that that we have he was a Kinsman tempted in every manner as we were tempted I I thought how little do I approach him on those grounds how often do I go to him and instead of approaching him in in fear and and afraid of judgment go to him and just say Lord you know what I'm going through you know what it's like right and you overcame yes would you depart to me that overcoming Grace that overcoming power I don't want to live this way I don't want to live in sin I I I I don't I don't want to I I don't want to be drawn away by every by every uh thing that comes along and and it canot go to him like he's somebody that doesn't care but he's somebody that feels so we see these Great Signs the signs of the angels we saw the sign of the wise men he said we have seen his star so we know the gospel is written in heaven and these wise men come and they see a sign they see a star they know that the Earth is moving that all the plan of God and all the planets and all the heavens were testifying to what that God has done how many know God uses the Heavens to to testify of his word he used the eclipse of the moon and our day to testify of the church ages we we know that we have a god that is telling man constantly what is transpiring right but if man's not inclined to the sign if man's not interested in the sign if man comes to the place that they feel that uh uh that everybody else has to obey the sign uh uh and he doesn't it reminds me of the man that driving with one day and we come up to the street and and we had the right away and there's stop signs on both sides and he came up and he stopped I said what are you stopping for he saidwell my brother-in-law might be coming did that go over your head see lot not everybody wants to obey the rules but we don't measure ourselves we know there's a purpose so just think of these wise men these wise men came and they came into the City and they they they were a sign so here they show up at at herod's uh a a place and and we we we recognize something's going on there's something transpiring this thing is not transpiring without God letting the world know that it was happening I mean you take Anna and Simeon in Luke 2 and3 he grabs the baby and he holds it and he says Lord let thy servant depart in peace for I have seen the glory of the Lord well they the scripture said that Anna and him were daily in the temple don't you think they told everybody in the temple he's coming soon the Messiah is here I'm here I know it in my spirit any day now he's going to show up there was events transpiring and the people were walking by the signs every day and one day Anna and them weren't there no more the sign was in their midst and it had transpired and nobody got the message I'm sure that if the Shepherds had told and I'm sure if Anna and Simeon had told people should have known I want you to catch this morning how important it is to hear the voice of the [Music] sign we find out in Matthew 2 and6 maybe they put that on the board and and uh and and just to look at it and and to uh it to me it's it strikes me uh when you you read this and and see this great thing that's that happened and it says in in Matthew so we know the wise men came and they they inquired of Jose of Herod they said where is he King of the Jews we have seen a star in the east and we've We've Come To Worship Him you think that would have lit him on fire wow uh he'd be moved by that no he said you go you go uh find them and worship then come back to me that I I might go worship him also and then he inquired of the of the priest and the scribes and the Pharisees concerning this thing which these wise men spoke of now can you talk about a sign and and and that and even investigating the sign knowing that the sign is true and then rejecting The Voice thereof we don't want to reject the voice of the sign and and so listen to this this is tragedy to me at its highest level and it said then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceedingly wroth and set forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in the coast and in all the coast thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently re uh inquired of the wise men so he goes out and he kills all these children in Bethlehem you would think that someone would say why did this happen what was this what's going on here why are these events transpiring because they were living in the day of the Fulfillment of the prophecy the sign let them know that there was a prophecy being fulfilled and then you look at the prophecy and and the prophecy simply says this he says and then then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet saying Rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not absolutely prophecy transpiring and nobody understood that was a sign now just take a moment to think that John the Baptist was a sign he was a sign and we know in Isaiah 43-5 it talks to us of the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the path make straight your your way that that uh that there was uh John was a sign and they inquired of John and he he said that I'm not even worthy to lose the sandals the one that is to follow me the voice that is to come you know I'm just the sign I'm the Forerunner Jesus even said he was the Forerunner he was the Fulfillment of Isa of Isaiah 40 and3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness and so we've seen all these signs let's just stop for a moment and knowing that they were signs and listening to the voice that followed those signs what a uh uh sign spoke of he spoke of one that is present with you and then we know that Jesus shows up at the at the banks of Jordan and there was another sign the dove like a pillar of fire descending upon him the spirit descending upon him like in the form of a dove and and and John says Behold the Lamb of God yeah the world ought have have taken it you know just because the world doesn't see the sign doesn't mean that you don't see it and you shouldn't take heed to the voice if everybody runs a stop sign I was driving with the gentleman the other day and he said to me he says I've never seen so many stop lights and stop signs ran like they're run nowadays and I says yeah since Co they don't stop you all you got to do is put a mask on and put a little sign on your window I've got Co they won't even ask for your driver's license no it's because nobody nobody hears the sign nobody adheres to the sign and there's no consequences for Law and and there's no there there's no judgment given for the law and there's no punishment given for the law we had a a a person here that burnt down a a a a Jack In The Box I think it was or something caught it on fire and they find them $500 well that's an invite to me for every arson in the country to go torch a Jack In The Box I'd pay 500 bucks to torch some place you know what I mean see you can't go by the crowd cuz when the crowd doesn't listen to the voice of the sign if everybody starts running stop signs and nobody's going to enforce it and everybody that doesn't mean that it gives everybody a right now no when the voice of the sign deteriorates the judgment will still come that's right and and so we find out that that they didn't hear they didn't hear this great this great sign and all of a sudden he shows up now he's his it's not going to go unheard of Jesus shows up at a feast a wedding Feast I believe it was in capernium if I'm not mistaken you could correct me if I'm I'm wrong and he's at this wedding feast and they run out of wine and and his mother says they've ran out of wine and he says woman and it's not in the contents that we would say it would it it would be a a respectful word for that almost like mother woman what is that to me and she says do whatever he ask you to do and he tells them what to do and they went and did it in fact it created such a store that they they wanted to know why did you save the best to last you don't think that people gave answers you don't think that the people that brought the water told the scriptures even begins to say that his Fame begin to spread abroad they knew that something was here that the voice of all those signs the voice of the wise men the voice of the Shepherds the voice of John the Baptist that voice was now sounding so every sign has a message that follows it so now the message of all those signs that they've heard about this child that was born the the why that these babies were slaughtered here he he is he's on the scene yes and the first thing he does is is he turns the water into wine oh if I wouldn't like to preach a sermon about water baptism turning into the stimulation of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I'd like to go there right now but but so the the the there's there's a move on right and then if you if you uh uh you go down and read a little further in John uh 4 uh uh I think is I don't know if John 4 yeah 45 and 56 uh somewhere in in that place in the scriptures that there was a noble man that was at that feast and when he heard that Jesus was back in town he went to him and said my son lies at the point of death come pray for him and Jesus has a conversation with him and he said and he he's still persistent and Jesus doesn't go he says go your son's healed and the mo the nobl man went home and found his son just the same healed just the same as Jesus has spoken it that many scholars say that was the second miracle that Jesus recorded but let's look at this voice what is this message that Jesus is bringing the god that they feared the god that that would become angry with him and put him in captivity the god that would judge him when they rejected him the same God that protected them was now dwelling with them no longer was he a god far off right but he was a God that was now walking with them that could be handled and touched and seen right so the message wasn't that God was far away but the voice was that God is present with us right now right now present with us and and he begin to to to demonstrate what his voice to them was that the God that was a far off was now a God that was there that there was an exodus fixing to take place that man was now going to be able to come from under the fear of the law and the judgments of the law into a place of grace and mercy there was a great uh voice that was speaking out and a great message right he was a voice of all those signs and this voice of this sign had a message that the god of grace and mercy was there and Not only was it in word but he began to demonstrate it he began to show that now that you could that the God that was a far off right is now a god that is present that can be touched by your infirmities that you can feel his goodness that you can feel his presence that you can feel the things that that that you can can actually come in contact with them right that you didn't have to go through goats and bloods and doves and everything but his freedom and his power and his goodness was now available for all men now they could actually see the proof of it right you take the woman at the well what a terrible condition I mean written off right had to go get her water by herself married six times what what bad shape but what was the message the message was you could be in that bad shape and this God still loves you this God still forgives you this God is still there for you this God can deler you he can heal you he can make it right I know he he he was demonstrating that he went to probably somebody that was in terrible condition so everybody else that was ever in a terrible condition can know that this voice and this sign in this message was something they could receive there's no need to walk in your past that's right there's no need to paint black clouds over your life there's no need to do Penance so much of the world still in Catholicism they make themselves suffer for their sins Penance is a rejection of forgiveness Penance is the rejection of the price that's paid for you moping and crying and sinning and saying that is just to look to the Lord and say I don't believe what you did you might say oh I I I believe that he did it no you don't you don't believe believe it you do not believe that he wiped your slight clean you still want to feel guilty because you like to live under that guilt because that guilt now becomes a reason to continue in the sin that you enjoy it just becomes an excuse and so what does man do when people have that excuse and they want to continue they want to continue in their games they want to continue in the things that they do they want to continue in that stuff but yet they know they wrap themselves in religion they don't accept the message that you're free what did he tell her go and sin no more your sins which are many are forgiven what did she do she accepted it she she took the liberty of having all the failures of her life failed marriage failed family uh just absolutely in in terrible social standing and she accepted what that she said sir I perceive that you're a prophet he said I have living water that you know not of she says well how can you don't have nothing to draw with he says it's a hell spring that'll spring up within you not from the outside but from the inside too many people always are looking off for God to do something out there change the world around him God changes the inside start right in your heart yes look at your own heart if you love the world and the things of the world the love of gods isn't in there but if you hate the world and you hate the way that you are and something in your heart she wanted to hear those words she couldn't find a way out right but the voice yes she saw the sign she perceived the sign she saw the sign go get your husband I don't have a h you spoke the truth you've had five husbands and the one that you're with I wonder if he told her where she lived and what her name was and what the guy she's living with now was and told her what her mother was and told her what happened to her as a child cu the prophet of God says what happened to her she accepted it she accepted the message not just the sign yes sir I'll say today too many people have accepted the sign of William Mary and brandom and have rejected the message that he brought and he didn't bring the re establishment of laws he didn't just bring dress codes he just didn't bring he brought life that's right he wanted to restore to us the same message that Jesus gave them that was our fathers what they accepted what they believed and what they rejoiced in what did she do she came from a street prostitute right on maybe she wasn't out there but from a destroyed marriage rejected uh having all kinds of trouble to having such a change such a Deliverance such a nature and Glory about her her face shining delivered free she said come see a man and many came out oh I would have liked to been at that prayer line Jesus they coming up to him you tell this is you're healed you're healed you're delivered you're healed that was his message we sing that song healing is here right salvation is here that's what he was telling them right all these benefits are here right forgiveness healing Deliverance no need to be sad life you don't have to be in Chains to your flesh and your mind you could just go down the woman that was caught in adultery I mean these are bad cases right but what was this message there's there's forgiveness for the worst case amen there's Deliverance the man possessed with Devils the man in the graveyard walking through the graveyard the the man with py the one who was crippled you could just go down it seems like every circumstance that was out there you understand the Nicodemus in the tree uh you can just go the the Pharisees daughter every every Walk of Life every circumstance every every imaginable circumstance he went and meant amen he went and stood in the face of that circumstance in the face of those conditions and his message was the God creator of Heaven and Earth is here to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above that which you can even ask or think that's right just think of the message right this great Christmas message this voice that came from those signs right what that he was bringing to the world right and yet our minds just keep rolling backwards into our yesterday I would love to wipe yesterday completely out of all of our memories and let you know you can startu this morning in Christ Jesus fresh and new Hallelujah that was the message that's right you'll never go make things right to justify what you did wrong did you hear me when Nicodemus you know here he is up in a tree right a little guy so he was mad at the world so he charged everybody you know he made a lot of money he would lend money and people owed him and that was his power trip so he could have control so he could feel like he was [Music] important you know and and Jesus talks to him come on down invites him to his house you know his old praying wife's over there praying and he he just got to check this out what's his wife talking about climbs up in a tree Jesus stop calls him down invites him and and all of a sudden Nicodemus he had a change of heart he wasn't trying to make things right he says I'm going to give a third of what I got I'm going to forgive everybody's debt man this guy was UN fire he was happy he wanted to share the news you don't think when he called that guy in he says hey you owe me this much money here just I'm I'm writing this off I want to tell you what happened to me I want to tell you what I experienced I was there I saw him Cal me down I heard what he said to me that he had come in the world to save them which is lost and and and to impart eternal life he gave me something he changed my insides I'm now a new creature I heard what he was saying the God that he was uh bringing the god that he was trying to bring me in contact with the great Jehovah that we've worshiped in fear now I feel his presence inside of me I've got life and life more abundant they were hearing his message that was his message all down through the scripture message after message trying to get the people in contact not with their imaginary Jehovah or their imaginary God or their imaginary religion or their theologies or their doctrines or they trying their explanation of Christian history you don't need to know my past all you need to do is meet my future you'll never know me by my past J You'll Never Know Me by my history the only way you'll know me is to meet me today that's right because I've changed I've learned some things I don't get upset as easily as I used to you got you you you it that's not this is not a history study you'll never know the message of today by studying the history of yesterday the only thing you will learn from history is that God does everything the same way that if he did it one way he'll do it again if he sent signs before he'll send Signs Now it's like emotion the presence of God brings emotion something that doesn't have emotions is dead it's dead right if it if the presence of God doesn't stir up emotion in you then bury it when when you feel the presence of the Lord it causes you emotion the secret though is to understand that the emotions come from the present the presence of the Lord so you don't put your emphasis on the emotion you put your emphasis on the presence amen he's here amen he's here that's he can do for you this morning exceedingly and abundantly above what you can think or ass you're not doomed time doesn't Doom you there was a blind boy that was blind from his youth I would say that I don't know how old he was he he was a pretty smart fellow though I my guess is probably he was in his 40s that's my guess I don't recall the prophet of God gave him an age or not but he was old enough to to uh answer for himself in fact when they came to his parents his parents said well he's old enough to answer for himself h long he had he been blind since birth since birth he didn't see can I say that that that guy's natural blindness yes was just a type of spiritual blindness that's right people are blind in the church World it could be for years and years and years but it doesn't mean the minute the eyes have of God's word which is the promise of the ladyc in church age is that you might have eyes sa that you might see that if someone applies the eyes have to that spiritually Blind Eye that all of a sudden their eyes won't come open and they'll see so here he is a long time what I want to say this message this voice this sign what he was telling the people it doesn't matter how long you've been the way you've been the presence is here to make a difference it doesn't matter how long that you haven't had a child it doesn't matter how long you've been sick it doesn't matter how long you've been possessed it doesn't matter how long you've been figh a habit time doesn't matter to God God's Eternal that's what he's bringing he's bringing the Eternal presence of God well you are yet a sinner he died for you didn't matter blind send youth spiritually blind sense youth spiritually blind none of that matters to him that's right cuz his his presence is what makes the difference and that was his message the presence of God is with you the I am is here he's veiled in flesh so you can see him if you don't believe me for my words believe me for my works it's not I that does the works it's the father that's in me that does the works what was he showing the world he was showing the world the real God the real attitude the real nature and he's giving the people the opportunity to come in and be partakers of that spirit that all their guilt all their sins all their failures is not an excuse it does not stop you Hallelujah from accepting what he's done just like having that passenger next year there's no need to stop nobody comes anyway you need no other voice but the voice of his message which was the works that I do shall you do also for the same God that's in me will be in you he's the same yesterday today and forever we could go through so many uh places in the Bible to to understand all the circumstances all the Miracles all the people every place he reached out was just the great voice saying that this message is for all people behold today is born a savior for all people don't Waller well you don't know how many times you've Fallen I don't need to know how many times you've Fallen I know when you get up in him you'll never fall again and if you do fall and the enemy traps you he says confess your sin and he's faithful and just to forgive it and you accept it none of those people could change themselves right they had to accept what he was offering they had to accept the voice and the message how many people in that day saw all those signs and never understood what was being offered a little part of the world then he sent them to an upper room and endured them with power from un High then now the what they saw in Jesus that spirit that was in Christ Jesus came back on him and it ain't blasphemy Brother The Same Spirit that dwell in Jesus Christ can dwell in [Music] us that was what he was trying to tell him that's right there's an exodus yes you're coming out of this law uh my message is come into His presence come into His goodness the things that you've seen me do you'll be able to do because the love of God will be shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit you say well this is my circumstances find some character in The Bible hallelujah hallelujah how many of those people in the new Testament those Miracles that I've seen on those lost and and conditions that I couldn't find myself in right don't let this mind battle destroy you take him at his word when he says you're forgiven you are forgiven how many know the one thing that God can't do the Bible says lie when he says your sins with are many are forgiven yes sir he didn't leave out one that's right and he knew them all and he already knows what you have need of even before you ask that's what a message that's right what a voice and the world missed it right they missed it they missed the fellowship that God was offering them to become in all the benefits he put on display all the power that he put on display all the making bread into wine and I mean uh multiplying the Loaves and the fishes and turning water into wine and raising the dead and and Healing The Sick and cleansing lepers oh my hallelujah what a God we serve what a mighty God we serve and he's trying to tell them don't worship that God that you think's locked up he rent that veil of that Temple to show them that God was now in the people God above us God With Us now God in us what a message that's where those disciples that's what he wanted the church to have that was the faith of our early fathers they accepted the message of the voice of the sign they were living in the days of the Fulfillment of Prophecy and they accepted it man these are not drunk as you suppose but this was was written of the Prophet doah I'll pour out my spirit they were living in the Fulfillment of the voice of the sign it's not religious substitute it's exing the message and the poor Gentile Church got so far away from that message that God's going to give them a sign too and he gave them the sign of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 amen he came again in our day with a sign I imagine imagine how his ministry started a little girl named Georgie Carter he goes prays for her she gets up he goes to a tent meeting on the road back from wherever he was coming back from I forget where and he stops in at a meeting and he says and they there was no flowers hallelu and they cried amen and there was no this and they cried and pretty soon the whole place was trying and he was crying and he was a Baptist he they said well we heard that there was a Baptist preacher here come on up and slid down this seat and someone said here he is and he got up and then this guy in Boots come and this other guy come and he begin to be invited and he began to tell the story how the angel came to him and how he'd know he'd take him by the hand now it's something if I said no I I'll take you by the hand we need to be like Shepherds right we need to go see if it was there how many people stood in line to come up so he could take them by the hand how many people did he take by the hand and he would see those bumps and those things move in his man and he would tell them what was wrong with them and he would deliver him and they experienced it you think the fame and of our Prophet messenger in this day went abroad based on [Music] nothing if I and he didn't even want the fame he wanted people to know that the same message that Jesus Christ preached the same Deliverance the same healing the the same power the same Deliverance over no matter how long no matter what no matter when that our God is the god of Heaven and Earth he's the creator of all things and by his stripes we are healed and the chastisement of our peace is upon him that was the message he wasn't trying to bring a new message he was bringing the message of the Lord Jesus Christ back to the gentile people that every in have a change of nature have a change of heart have freedom in Deliverance wasn't a new message it was the same message Paul bought to the Gentiles it was the same message Peter brought it's only one message that's the word of God man tried to cover it up they've tried to use it for their own Advantage but God living in the day of the the Fulfillment of Prophecy has the same voice following the sign behold th send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord it didn't matter many people probably stood up many people today I've had them come through here by the dozens telling me that they're the two prophets to Israel of course you don't want to know my response wants I said what are you doing here then if you're the prophet to Israel you don't need me I'm a gentile I've already gotten my Prophet Malachi 4:5 take take a trip I might have said it nicer than that I doubt it but I but but he just couldn't make that statement right he got out and proved that's right amen just like Jesus proved by signs and wonders that his message was true he got up and proved his message was true he took them by the hand and they were healed can you go to Jonesboro Arkansas 45,000 people show up they're camped everywhere I love that story he's in the crowd and this little blind girl bumps into him grabs him by the call her and says sir he says yes he said can you get me to the preacher man she said well what about your daddy he said you get me to the preacher man I'll find my daddy Hallelujah that's what he's trying to restore that's the faith that he wants you to have that's the life that he wants you to have he's the same yesterday today and forever he can do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask her [Music] things you don't think God arranges things you don't think God works on both ends you one in 45,000 chance or even greater that of all the people she runs into there he is just like that woman at the well oh we hear that the Messiah will do these things he said some of the greatest words anybody could ever hear I'm he Hall he said to her I'm that Preacher Man I'm that Preacher Man are you brother brand yeah I guess she went and found her Daddy oh over and over and over that's right proved that was the sign right you believe the sign I'm asking you this morning have you believed the message the voice of the sign amen have you believed the the what the sign was trying to tell you trying to tell you of the Peril that was ahead trying to tell you of the power that we have the joy that we have unspeakable full of Glory H have we we got so envisioned on the sign that we've missed the message that what he was trying to tell us what was the sign for to restore to us the Faith of Our Fathers the movement of the Holy Spirit the footsteps of the righteous being led by the Lord the change of our nature sometimes you go a long time as a Christian and you're doing good and you're praising God then that old nature Creeps in and he shows his head that's the time to run back say you're sorry and get in your prayer closet till the sweetness of the Lord fills your heart again I I I even tell on myself I was at Home Depot trying to pick up some Sheetrock and everything and I and some guy had come parked in the loading zone he got a pickup trp H and I knew what was going on you know I go there and and everybody that pulls in there thinks he's important that his business is the most important thing and that he buys enough that he earned the right to park in the Looney zone so you know he parked and I called his number and I said hey I I've got to load up will you you come move your truck you know and I'm under pressure CU if I don't get this sheet rock back the sheet Rockers are going to leave and I might not get him back for four or five days you know and this guy's holding me up yeah I forgot who really runs the show you know really he could have stayed there all week I'd have got my street rck you know I'd have to go there but so and he wouldn't come and he wouldn't come so when he got there I said hey you know uh this you parked in a loaning Zone I said you know there's thousands of parking places there you you can't hold this up well you know he got uh he got upset and started uh uh you know get out of my face and all this stuff and everything you know I felt feisty I felt young again I almost wanted to fight sometimes I forget I'm too old you know

says no just a lot of pressure with business nowadays I says I hope that I can do some business with you someday and we shook hands and made everything right wonderful and and and went on you know and and and I begin to think in my heart you know we're missing this message of peace right that we have you know and we're living in the day of the Fulfillment of pro prophecy that's right the things that the voice has told us we're living in the day that it's coming to pass and I've come to the place that I'm tired of letting the perversion of this world I was told in Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of Sodom and gomorah shall so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is revealed when the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ doing the same Works would come down and Veil himself in a prophet messenger in this generation and do the same signs and wonders that Jesus did so the people could receive the same message that Jesus gave Hallelujah joy unspeakable and full of Glory peace that's her path's understanding turn the other cheek go the extra mile if they C curse you they curse them before you rejoice when you're persecuted by all men for behold am your Redemption draweth nigh look up for your salvation draws nigh and I thought I've let the corruption of this world the political corruption I've been told it's corrupt I've looked everything about it and and I know I believe in the sign I've seen the Miracles I know it and how much time time that we can look at the sign and fail to get the voice and the message that the sign is giv we are living in the day of the Fulfillment of so many prophecies that are spoken but what was the sign given for that we could receive the message and what was the message we're living in the last days the coming of the Lord is at hand look up your Redemption draweth nigh what a thing we can do today is sure the world's corrupt sure it's headed toward destruction but I'm not I'm going up I'm going out yes I
