[24:00] that i know that uh
[24:01] many of our folks are down in louisiana

[24:06] certainly want to remember them this
[24:08] morning we welcome all our visitors
[24:10] amen buddha michael mccandy and family
[24:13] certainly glad to have you with us and
[24:15] all of you that are visiting god bless
[24:17] you this morning as you invite by the
[24:18] mic for us so i'm reading amen
[24:40] good morning
[24:43] yeah
[24:45] you know we just got back from a
[24:48] couple weeks out in the mountains of
[24:50] colorado
[24:52] it's um
[24:55] it's hard not to sit there and see these
[24:57] massive mountains and these
[25:00] huge forests and these great waterfalls
[25:05] and come up and not think of the
[25:06] glorious majesty of his creation
[25:10] you know of how his mighty hand has
[25:13] created such
[25:15] huge
[25:16] wonderful things
[25:17] and you sit there and you
[25:20] you know when you look at all the
[25:21] enormity of that you know you can feel a
[25:23] little bit like a speck
[25:27] you know and it occurred to me we look
[25:29] at psalm 8
[25:31] this morning i think david
[25:34] maybe felt very
[25:35] very much the same
[25:38] at least at some point in his life but
[25:40] certainly when he penned to this
[25:42] scripture it says very familiar to us it
[25:45] says in verse 3
[25:47] when i consider thy heavens
[25:50] the work of thy fingers
[25:52] the moon and the stars which thou hast
[25:54] ordained
[25:56] what is man
[25:57] that thou art mindful of him
[26:00] and the son of man that thou visitest
[26:02] him
[26:03] you know and no you can't feel any more
[26:06] that way but when you're sitting in
[26:08] front of his glorious creation and
[26:10] seeing that you know certainly the
[26:11] scripture came through my mind i'm sure
[26:13] many of us in this room have had a
[26:14] similar experience where you looked at
[26:17] some beautiful thing that the lord had
[26:19] created and said boy what is man
[26:22] that thou art mindful of him but
[26:24] you know as i was kind of reading that
[26:26] and thinking about that another verse
[26:28] popped into my mind which kind of caught
[26:30] my attention and it's verse 6.
[26:33] it says this
[26:34] thou madeest him
[26:36] man
[26:38] to have dominion
[26:39] over the works
[26:40] of thy hands
[26:42] thou has put all things under his feet
[26:46] amen
[26:47] how many of you have sat there looking
[26:49] at a 14 000 foot mountain with all those
[26:52] forests and waterfalls in the wildlife
[26:54] and said
[26:55] he's given me dominion over that
[26:58] i admit that i haven't
[27:00] thought that very often until
[27:03] i started looking at the scripture
[27:05] and it caused me to look at his creation
[27:09] in a brand new light
[27:12] you know it's easy to say amen when you
[27:14] say look at the beautiful creation that
[27:16] he's created what a wonderful and
[27:18] glorious and majestic thing he's done
[27:21] but it's another thing entirely to say
[27:22] amen when you look at the same thing
[27:25] and say he's given us dominion over that
[27:30] it says thou madest him to have dominion
[27:33] over the works
[27:35] of thy hands
[27:36] you know as i thought about that another
[27:38] scripture popped into my mind it's in
[27:40] matthew 21 when jesus was speaking to
[27:42] his disciples
[27:44] it says in 21 18 now in the morning
[27:47] as he returned into the city
[27:49] he hungered
[27:51] and when he saw a fig tree in the way he
[27:54] came to it and found nothing there on
[27:56] but leaves only
[27:58] and said unto it let no fruit grow on
[28:00] the hence forward forever and presently
[28:03] the fig tree withered away
[28:06] and when the disciples saw it they
[28:07] marveled saying how soon
[28:10] is the fig tree withered away
[28:12] jesus answered and said unto them verily
[28:14] i say unto you if ye have faith
[28:18] and doubt not
[28:19] ye shall not only do this which is done
[28:22] to the fig tree
[28:23] but also if ye shall say unto this
[28:26] mountain
[28:27] fourteen thousand feet tall
[28:30] be thou removed
[28:32] and be thou cast into the sea
[28:35] it shall be done
[28:38] you know
[28:40] perhaps we need to be reminded as we
[28:42] look at these things that
[28:45] sure
[28:46] the beauty of his creation
[28:48] is something that certainly demonstrates
[28:50] his glory and his power and his majesty
[28:53] but maybe we need to be reminded
[28:55] that that's an example of the physical
[28:57] realm
[28:59] which
[29:00] a people have been called
[29:02] commanded to have dominion over
[29:06] what is man
[29:08] that thou art mindful of him you know
[29:10] the whole world is all caught up
[29:12] concerned about things like climate
[29:13] change
[29:14] deforestation
[29:16] pandemics
[29:19] let me tell you what was not so from the
[29:20] beginning
[29:23] it says in romans 8 here's what's
[29:25] happening the physical realm is missing
[29:27] its master
[29:29] it says in romans 8 19 for the earnest
[29:32] expectation of the create creature
[29:35] creation
[29:36] waiteth
[29:37] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[29:41] for the creature
[29:42] creation
[29:43] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[29:47] but by reason of him who hath subjected
[29:49] the same in hope because the creature
[29:53] creation
[29:54] itself
[29:55] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[29:58] of corruption
[29:59] into the glorious liberty of the
[30:02] children of god
[30:04] for we know the whole creation
[30:07] groaneth and travaileth in pain
[30:11] together until now
[30:13] it says in verse six thou madest him
[30:16] to have dominion over the works of thy
[30:19] hands
[30:21] if somebody
[30:23] could allow themselves to submit to
[30:25] submit themselves entirely
[30:28] to thus saith the lord
[30:31] there is nothing in the physical realm
[30:34] that would be beyond his control
[30:38] we are each spiritual creatures
[30:41] that have been placed in a physical
[30:44] realm
[30:45] for us to take dominion over
[30:48] and fulfill genesis 1 28.
[30:52] and psalm 8 6 remind us as of that
[30:54] thou hast put all things
[30:57] under his feet
[30:58] so i don't know if that was a blessing
[31:00] to you but to me it certainly changed
[31:01] things as i was looking at fourteen
[31:04] thousand foot mountains forests and
[31:07] waterfalls and herds of elk and these
[31:09] types of things
[31:11] there's a position that we've been
[31:13] called to to master the physical realm
[31:15] that we've been put into if we can
[31:18] submit ourselves fully
[31:19] to thus saith the lord
[31:22] so it certainly caused me to look at
[31:23] things in a different light there and
[31:25] maybe that you know that'd be a blessing
[31:27] to you and a good reminder but let's
[31:28] read that together in psalm 8. it's just
[31:31] a short chapter it should be familiar to
[31:33] us
[31:35] starting in verse 1 o lord our lord how
[31:38] excellent is thy name in all the earth
[31:41] who has set thy glory above the heavens
[31:45] out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
[31:47] has thou ordained strength because of
[31:49] thine enemies that thou mightest still
[31:52] the enemy and the avenger
[31:54] when i consider thy heavens the work of
[31:57] thy fingers the moon and the stars which
[32:00] thou hast ordained
[32:02] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[32:05] and the son of man that thou visitest
[32:07] him
[32:08] for thou has made him a little lower
[32:10] than the angels and has crowned him with
[32:12] glory and honor thou madest him to have
[32:16] dominion over the works of thy hands
[32:18] thou has put all things under his feet
[32:21] all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of
[32:24] the field the fowl of the air and the
[32:27] fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth
[32:30] through the paths of the seas
[32:32] o lord our lord how excellent is thy
[32:35] name in all the earth amen

[1:00:03] i talked with brother nathan bryant this
[1:00:05] morning he sends us greetings to the
[1:00:07] church we certainly want to pass that
[1:00:10] along
[1:00:11] to you
[1:00:14] i
[1:00:15] kind of was wondering about how i wanted
[1:00:17] to
[1:00:18] approach
[1:00:20] this this morning so
[1:00:22] i thought that
[1:00:25] i'm done
[1:00:29] i i don't know i think i really think
[1:00:31] they have a revelation that i'm going to
[1:00:32] sing a special
[1:00:35] but we'll do it thank you so much
[1:00:38] everybody for
[1:00:39] playing i noticed we got some rails up
[1:00:44] i guess that's good
[1:00:49] that's good i don't know who did that
[1:00:51] but that's wonderful
[1:00:53] so thank you very much i enjoyed that
[1:00:55] special this morning
[1:00:57] our friends visiting with us god richly
[1:01:00] bless you this morning in each one we
[1:01:02] have a lot out there's a lot
[1:01:04] going on
[1:01:07] i know i think school starting up pretty
[1:01:09] quick and people are wrapping up their
[1:01:11] vacations and
[1:01:12] and those things but
[1:01:14] uh all we can do is keep going on day by
[1:01:17] day right
[1:01:18] as
[1:01:19] you know like as the
[1:01:20] church
[1:01:22] changes you know people come they go
[1:01:26] they pass on they're born
[1:01:29] but we know that there's a great eternal
[1:01:32] goal
[1:01:33] that we're all going to reach
[1:01:36] one of these days
[1:01:38] uh we were talking here the other day
[1:01:40] about
[1:01:42] uh how things have changed so much
[1:01:46] in the last couple years
[1:01:51] when
[1:01:52] as many have referred to it as a plague
[1:01:56] struck our country
[1:01:58] all of a sudden people had a routine of
[1:02:00] life a way they did things the way they
[1:02:03] thought
[1:02:04] they had expectations of what they
[1:02:06] expected and what they
[1:02:08] thought would come and what would happen
[1:02:10] and all of a sudden in the instant of
[1:02:13] just a few months time
[1:02:16] people weren't going to work
[1:02:18] kids weren't going to school
[1:02:21] um
[1:02:23] everything was locked down
[1:02:26] and shut down our freedoms were
[1:02:29] snatched up from us and
[1:02:32] then all kinds of
[1:02:34] uh
[1:02:35] information and voices and
[1:02:37] things were coming out and people were
[1:02:40] citing and taking
[1:02:42] sides and opinions on things there was a
[1:02:47] a physical turmoil there was a great
[1:02:50] uh
[1:02:51] political turmoil uh just a lot of
[1:02:55] things and
[1:02:57] so
[1:02:58] it's very difficult not to have all
[1:03:01] these things affect you
[1:03:04] you know what i'm saying uh
[1:03:06] people became very discontent
[1:03:09] and they were discontent with everything
[1:03:13] and
[1:03:14] so
[1:03:15] uh
[1:03:16] but the one thing that we know is is
[1:03:19] that god's word doesn't change
[1:03:22] and so
[1:03:23] that's why that i just feel that the
[1:03:26] lord put on our heart
[1:03:29] to take the message of the hour
[1:03:31] and to go through it you know step by
[1:03:34] step and just feed on it
[1:03:37] and so we're going to start this morning
[1:03:41] and probably for the next several weeks
[1:03:44] ministering from this message
[1:03:48] it is the rising of the sun
[1:03:52] and
[1:03:53] i was taken
[1:03:56] back even by the title
[1:03:59] of the sermon
[1:04:01] um i want to talk a little bit for the
[1:04:04] next few minutes before we listen
[1:04:07] of
[1:04:09] how in my heart
[1:04:11] that i chose to approach
[1:04:15] this message
[1:04:16] and even the title
[1:04:19] is a signal to us
[1:04:22] of
[1:04:22] how to
[1:04:25] approach something or what to look for
[1:04:29] or you know or or
[1:04:31] what what is the the terminology that
[1:04:34] they use and key in
[1:04:36] on something
[1:04:38] and it says it is
[1:04:41] the rising of the sun
[1:04:44] you know uh
[1:04:45] uh someone said to the to me the other
[1:04:47] days are you looking to listen to
[1:04:50] uh
[1:04:51] this is
[1:04:52] and i thought this is
[1:04:54] no
[1:04:55] it doesn't say
[1:04:57] this is it says it
[1:05:00] is
[1:05:02] and so we
[1:05:04] when we're
[1:05:05] going to
[1:05:07] start listening
[1:05:12] brother rem starts this tape
[1:05:15] out in a very
[1:05:18] unusual
[1:05:19] way
[1:05:20] if i could say that
[1:05:23] he starts out by talking about the
[1:05:26] opening of the seven seals
[1:05:28] and about the sword
[1:05:30] coming into his hand
[1:05:33] and about
[1:05:35] the great witness of all the phenomena
[1:05:38] that had taken place to make this uh
[1:05:42] this word what it is
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:46] as as i was just praying about it and we
[1:05:48] were riding down the road the other day
[1:05:51] on our way to the visitation
[1:05:54] and to the gravesite service
[1:05:56] billy and i and brother cosman we were
[1:06:00] listening to the
[1:06:01] first part
[1:06:03] of this message and it struck me and i i
[1:06:06] set out to the brothers i said did you
[1:06:08] ever wonder why he started the tape
[1:06:12] this way
[1:06:14] and
[1:06:15] as you notice it's the
[1:06:18] the picture of the uh
[1:06:21] uh
[1:06:22] cloud that we have
[1:06:24] here
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:26] the
[1:06:27] church ages
[1:06:29] and the things that have that is the
[1:06:31] thing that has seemed to raise up
[1:06:36] the biggest question
[1:06:38] about the validity of the message
[1:06:42] and i thought isn't it strange that he's
[1:06:44] going to start preaching a sermon this
[1:06:47] is the rising of the sun
[1:06:50] not past tense
[1:06:52] but present tense in other words
[1:06:54] something is rising now
[1:06:57] there's a rising of the sun going on now
[1:07:01] but he so he and he stops steps back and
[1:07:04] he says the cloud this that appeared and
[1:07:06] the seven angels that went up and how
[1:07:09] they caught a picture of it
[1:07:11] and and
[1:07:13] and i thought you know this is the thing
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:16] everybody can't
[1:07:17] a grasp is because they try to make a
[1:07:21] timeline
[1:07:23] you if you understand they try to say
[1:07:25] this event happens and this event
[1:07:27] happens but if this and i i believe this
[1:07:31] comes out in this message
[1:07:33] in a very beautiful way but
[1:07:37] when
[1:07:38] if something's eternal
[1:07:42] you understand
[1:07:43] it already is
[1:07:45] there's no timeline because everything
[1:07:49] is already in existence
[1:07:52] you you understand what i'm saying now
[1:07:55] you were in existence is that right you
[1:07:58] were in the thoughts of god before the
[1:08:01] foundation of the world
[1:08:04] isn't that what he said you shouted for
[1:08:07] joy the sons of god shouted for joy so
[1:08:11] you were already eternal in existence
[1:08:15] there was there's no
[1:08:17] so when did you when did you happen
[1:08:22] now you want to put it in the timeline
[1:08:25] of your life
[1:08:26] i i was born in
[1:08:28] october 27
[1:08:31] 1949 which is no longer my birthday it's
[1:08:34] now evan's birthday but that's all right
[1:08:39] but so we always look at things like in
[1:08:42] a calendar timeline this has to happen
[1:08:46] before this has to happen and this caps
[1:08:49] to happen but if you can stand back and
[1:08:52] realize the whole thing was already in
[1:08:56] existence from beginning to end i'm
[1:08:59] alpha i'm omega i'm the beginning i'm
[1:09:02] the ann
[1:09:05] so it's it's like a canvas
[1:09:08] and and it's been painted on and then
[1:09:10] man walks up with the uh a magnifying
[1:09:14] glass and wants to know which stroke was
[1:09:17] here first
[1:09:21] because you ever notice the painter will
[1:09:22] paint something and then he'll come back
[1:09:25] over and paint over it again and he'll
[1:09:28] come back over and he'll paint over it
[1:09:30] again and maybe he'll go over the whole
[1:09:32] canvas
[1:09:34] and keep going back painting and
[1:09:36] painting and adding and adding until it
[1:09:40] comes into full manifestation to your
[1:09:44] eye
[1:09:44] but when the first stroke was laid down
[1:09:47] what was in his mind was in the first
[1:09:51] row
[1:09:53] so when when the you know that's why
[1:09:55] that song was so beautiful to me he says
[1:09:59] from heaven's point of view
[1:10:02] it's just a hill
[1:10:05] and so in other words when the lord
[1:10:07] looked down at it he knew when adam
[1:10:09] would come he knew when moses would come
[1:10:12] he they were already in existence we're
[1:10:15] the one that makes the timeline
[1:10:18] we're the one that said oh the angels
[1:10:20] went up here and he was here and he was
[1:10:23] over here and and uh this is over here
[1:10:26] and somebody was in houston and and i i
[1:10:31] can't it was all in existence
[1:10:35] already
[1:10:37] it's eternal
[1:10:40] all this was already here
[1:10:46] because with god
[1:10:48] if it's spoken
[1:10:50] it's finished
[1:10:54] it doesn't matter
[1:10:56] if the angels so when the lord looked
[1:10:59] down he saw him he knew he was going to
[1:11:01] send the angels he knew he was going to
[1:11:03] give the vision
[1:11:04] it's it it's we're trying to take the
[1:11:07] puzzle
[1:11:08] and put the pieces together in a
[1:11:11] timeline
[1:11:13] but it didn't for god
[1:11:16] it's the whole painting
[1:11:18] it's the whole thing it's already in
[1:11:20] existence do you believe you have a
[1:11:22] place prepared for you
[1:11:24] do you believe there's a body waiting
[1:11:26] for you
[1:11:28] it's already what it's already there
[1:11:31] it's already finished the timeline was
[1:11:34] just given to us
[1:11:37] because the scripture says the kingdom
[1:11:39] of god is within you that you can't know
[1:11:41] the beginning or the end of it
[1:11:44] you can't comprehend it
[1:11:46] we are what's called straight line
[1:11:48] thinkers
[1:11:49] we can't we can't understand two things
[1:11:53] happening simultaneously
[1:12:00] can you imagine
[1:12:01] philip trying to explain
[1:12:04] how he was just here
[1:12:08] an hour ago
[1:12:10] the timeline
[1:12:13] don't work
[1:12:16] but it does an eternity
[1:12:19] okay so
[1:12:20] there's a just to me there was a great
[1:12:22] reason
[1:12:24] why that he started out this way because
[1:12:27] he's trying to bring to us the effect
[1:12:30] the
[1:12:31] understanding
[1:12:33] that there is
[1:12:35] a resurrection
[1:12:37] and a rising of the sun
[1:12:39] happening now
[1:12:41] it's not the timeline event
[1:12:44] that this happened
[1:12:46] 2000 years ago
[1:12:49] so he'll go into a portion of this
[1:12:52] message
[1:12:53] where he talks about memorial
[1:12:56] he says to everybody else around easter
[1:12:59] is a memorial
[1:13:01] it's a memorial no matter how you
[1:13:03] celebrate it whether you celebrate it
[1:13:05] with easter bunnies or or all those
[1:13:08] things that's not what matters the point
[1:13:10] of the theme is is that it's a memorial
[1:13:14] and a memorial looks back in memory
[1:13:21] of something that happened
[1:13:23] so it's looking back as a as a memory so
[1:13:27] they're remembering
[1:13:30] that the lord rose from the dead they're
[1:13:33] remembering to that to that the s-o-n
[1:13:37] came out of the grave so it's in the
[1:13:40] form of of
[1:13:42] of a of a remembrance
[1:13:45] but what what is magnificent in what
[1:13:48] he's trying to express to us there is
[1:13:52] also now in this generation a rising of
[1:13:56] the sun
[1:14:00] and as we listen to this
[1:14:02] he will go through a small portion this
[1:14:04] morning where he talks about when the
[1:14:07] sun that rose up
[1:14:09] in the beginning of creation the first
[1:14:12] sunrise when there was the very first
[1:14:15] natural sun
[1:14:17] came upon the earth
[1:14:19] it brought forth the seed life
[1:14:24] is that right
[1:14:26] now all this was laid in here in
[1:14:28] beautiful type
[1:14:30] what happened to the church seed
[1:14:33] it went into the ground
[1:14:36] so there had to be a rising of uh the
[1:14:39] sun to bring that seed that was in the
[1:14:42] ground to life
[1:14:45] so it's not the resurrection of memorial
[1:14:49] looking back when jesus rose
[1:14:52] and brought life
[1:14:53] and so the difference between
[1:14:56] this sermon in one aspect
[1:14:59] and the message the easter seal the
[1:15:02] easter seal brother branham talks uh
[1:15:05] quite a bit about the quickening power
[1:15:08] he will also in this message but it is
[1:15:12] what that
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:15] resurrection brought back to the church
[1:15:18] the power that it brought back
[1:15:23] now remember
[1:15:24] this
[1:15:26] this uh
[1:15:27] great
[1:15:29] power or this great quickening
[1:15:32] power that came upon the church
[1:15:36] it it produced something
[1:15:39] and so we talked a little bit about this
[1:15:41] i'd like to read this statement we'll
[1:15:43] hear it just a moment satan doesn't care
[1:15:45] how religious you are
[1:15:48] now religion is the memorial
[1:15:54] that's all religions are
[1:15:57] all religions are in memory
[1:16:00] of what that he's done
[1:16:02] remember man's always talking about what
[1:16:05] he done and that's what they wanted to
[1:16:07] do let us build three temples let us let
[1:16:10] us lay a memorial here for what happened
[1:16:13] when they crossed the jordan river they
[1:16:15] took 12 stones and they laid it there as
[1:16:18] a memorial to remember
[1:16:21] but this is not bringing this is trying
[1:16:23] to bring us past
[1:16:25] remembering
[1:16:27] press acknowledging what that he's done
[1:16:30] and what that he's done for us by paying
[1:16:33] the price for our sins at calvary we are
[1:16:36] beneficiaries of that now
[1:16:39] but what he's trying to bring our
[1:16:41] understanding to is what is happening
[1:16:45] now
[1:16:49] what is what is transpiring so we don't
[1:16:52] want to look back in the light of a
[1:16:54] memorial let's remember this let's
[1:16:57] remember this so i get up this morning
[1:16:59] and i preach let's remember
[1:17:02] that he died on the cross
[1:17:06] let's remember that he gave the baptism
[1:17:09] of the holy spirit
[1:17:11] let's remember these things let's look
[1:17:14] at what's already
[1:17:16] uh been purchased for us
[1:17:20] but this is a church
[1:17:23] that is rising
[1:17:27] so we're it's not what we want to
[1:17:30] remember and hold on to what we remember
[1:17:34] but it's like
[1:17:35] what is what is transpiring now
[1:17:39] what is god doing with me now what
[1:17:42] what's taking place within me now
[1:17:46] because i believe we're all changing our
[1:17:49] desires are changing our appetites are
[1:17:52] changing
[1:17:53] the what that we're searching for in
[1:17:55] life is changing uh
[1:17:58] people it's a time that man will run to
[1:18:01] and fro because they're hungry is it
[1:18:04] here is it there like i i can't find the
[1:18:07] satisfaction that i want to
[1:18:10] find very good
[1:18:13] maybe if i do this maybe if i do that
[1:18:17] and that's all right
[1:18:21] that's all right but he wants to reveal
[1:18:24] to us
[1:18:25] what he's doing so we can understand
[1:18:28] what's happening to us
[1:18:34] then we can understand how can i
[1:18:36] how can i be
[1:18:38] a christian for so many years and all of
[1:18:41] a sudden find myself in these hardships
[1:18:46] how could i be raised the way that i'm
[1:18:48] raised and then still find such weakness
[1:18:54] because there's something that's got to
[1:18:55] transpire
[1:18:58] that's got to happen so this is what he
[1:19:00] said so all religion
[1:19:03] is a memorial
[1:19:05] it's man
[1:19:08] remembering
[1:19:11] and doing something
[1:19:14] to honor
[1:19:16] the memory
[1:19:17] the catholic priest dressed up in all
[1:19:20] these robes and puts on hats and
[1:19:23] throws incense and lights candles
[1:19:27] it's all in
[1:19:28] memory
[1:19:30] but what he's doing
[1:19:33] is slips
[1:19:34] by he says so
[1:19:37] this is paragraph 30 when we get to it
[1:19:40] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:19:42] or how right you are in your doctrine
[1:19:48] if you miss that life
[1:19:51] you won't come up
[1:19:54] anyhow
[1:19:55] no matter how religious how good or how
[1:19:59] many churches you belong to
[1:20:02] or will belong to
[1:20:05] it doesn't matter one thing unless
[1:20:08] you've been born again
[1:20:11] now so
[1:20:13] and we know from the easter seal
[1:20:16] what the seal of being born again was
[1:20:20] was a quickening power
[1:20:22] now this life
[1:20:24] is
[1:20:25] not a
[1:20:28] manufactured life
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:32] okay
[1:20:33] it's a life that's given
[1:20:38] took all the religion in the world will
[1:20:40] not
[1:20:42] give you or create that gift
[1:20:46] it it's a gift that's given
[1:20:50] god
[1:20:51] gives
[1:20:52] the life
[1:20:53] to the seed
[1:20:55] so all the seed was laying there in
[1:20:57] creation right but what had to happen
[1:21:00] was the sun had to rise
[1:21:03] and it was the sun
[1:21:05] striking
[1:21:10] just like the apple seed every apple the
[1:21:12] tree the every apple that tree's ever
[1:21:15] going to produce is in that seed but
[1:21:18] something has to move
[1:21:20] upon that seed in order for that seed to
[1:21:25] come into the process and that's what he
[1:21:28] said he said he would hold up a scene he
[1:21:31] said oh
[1:21:32] look at my apple orchard
[1:21:37] now
[1:21:38] in a man's point of view
[1:21:42] it ain't an apple orchard
[1:21:45] but from god's point of view it is an
[1:21:47] apple orchard
[1:21:51] because it was created and planned to
[1:21:53] produce this orchard
[1:21:56] so if you're trying to find a timeline
[1:21:59] someone will say oh
[1:22:01] don't call don't call it this yet
[1:22:03] because it it's not here and this
[1:22:05] happened here and that happened there
[1:22:07] and and and they're just all over the
[1:22:10] place poor poor people
[1:22:14] very good
[1:22:17] so this life is given
[1:22:20] now in the easter seal the prophet of
[1:22:22] god explained what that life was
[1:22:25] he explained like what that life did
[1:22:28] he explain
[1:22:30] that you had to have it right
[1:22:34] but in this is the rising of the sun
[1:22:38] he's explaining to the church
[1:22:41] how they're going to get it
[1:22:44] what has to happen
[1:22:47] there has to be a rising of a sun
[1:22:51] there has to be a light
[1:22:54] that shines out over the seed to bring
[1:22:57] it to life
[1:23:03] it's got to have it's got its part
[1:23:07] but it'll never be
[1:23:09] so command can't
[1:23:11] start that resurrection in them
[1:23:15] by memorial
[1:23:19] they can't start the resurrection in
[1:23:21] them
[1:23:22] by
[1:23:23] study
[1:23:24] or
[1:23:25] or by theology
[1:23:27] there's got to be something
[1:23:30] that happens in order for it to come to
[1:23:34] life no matter how much it's the crying
[1:23:37] to come to life and
[1:23:42] the other seeds i want to come to life i
[1:23:44] want to break out of this ground i want
[1:23:47] to come up but the plan of god says that
[1:23:50] the light
[1:23:53] has got to come across it
[1:23:57] amen
[1:23:59] and god chose
[1:24:01] away
[1:24:03] he said there is a man here
[1:24:05] that can turn on the light
[1:24:07] there's a ministry here
[1:24:10] that will be the light
[1:24:12] there there's a the the coming of the
[1:24:16] son of man
[1:24:17] this resurrection
[1:24:19] this light
[1:24:20] has come to shine upon the seed you can
[1:24:24] take this bible all you want but god
[1:24:27] ordained
[1:24:29] that the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17
[1:24:33] 30 revelations 10 7 that this spirit
[1:24:38] this voice this word had to shine
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:46] on the seed
[1:24:51] you can't bypass it
[1:24:57] because the very life
[1:24:59] the deity
[1:25:01] of god which is the creator of life and
[1:25:04] the bringer of life dwelt and was failed
[1:25:08] in that flesh
[1:25:13] the word
[1:25:15] that's folk life
[1:25:19] it was inexistent
[1:25:20] and as we listen this he'll you we'll
[1:25:22] see
[1:25:23] even though we're going to be chopping
[1:25:25] this up
[1:25:27] is that you'll see how he talks about
[1:25:29] the sun that came up
[1:25:31] and what it did to the natural scene
[1:25:34] he's all leading
[1:25:36] to the understanding
[1:25:39] of really what this message
[1:25:42] is to us
[1:25:45] and why it's so important that we don't
[1:25:49] depart from it
[1:25:54] a lot of people
[1:25:56] want to take the the teachings
[1:26:00] the benefits
[1:26:02] and leave the vessel
[1:26:07] the light didn't shine
[1:26:09] through any other vessel
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:13] and you can't separate the messenger
[1:26:17] from the message
[1:26:19] you want to take the message and then
[1:26:22] you want to say this it's the message
[1:26:25] that the light
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] no
[1:26:30] no
[1:26:32] it's the
[1:26:34] evidence that the life was in the vessel
[1:26:41] and put on display
[1:26:43] that gives it its validity
[1:26:51] isn't that what he said
[1:26:52] the real proof is is that
[1:26:56] he does what it says it would do
[1:26:59] that's the real seal of it so how can we
[1:27:04] talk about the quickening power if the
[1:27:06] quickening power wasn't manifested in
[1:27:09] the flesh
[1:27:10] how could we talk about the resurrection
[1:27:13] if the resurrection wasn't
[1:27:16] manufactured in the flesh
[1:27:19] and that's what he brings up there's
[1:27:21] been a lot of good men that have gone on
[1:27:23] before but there's only one that proved
[1:27:27] the resurrection was true
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:31] and there's only one
[1:27:33] way
[1:27:35] that the seed can come to life it's to
[1:27:38] have the sunlight of the word
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:45] go across it
[1:27:48] not secondhand
[1:27:53] you know they have what they call grow
[1:27:55] lamps and hot hot hat i don't know
[1:27:58] i've had hot house tomatoes
[1:28:00] and then i had a friend of mine bring me
[1:28:02] some tomatoes out of his garden
[1:28:05] man alive
[1:28:08] almost like tomatoes
[1:28:11] i mean
[1:28:12] unbelievable so this is a life that's
[1:28:15] quit given
[1:28:17] the quickening power is a life that's
[1:28:19] given
[1:28:21] it has a source
[1:28:23] it has a place that it comes from
[1:28:25] it comes from the word of god not second
[1:28:28] hand
[1:28:32] but straight from the sword
[1:28:34] and so this is the
[1:28:36] the approach
[1:28:37] that
[1:28:38] we're as we listen to this
[1:28:41] and we go through it we want to be
[1:28:44] understanding that he's he's laying out
[1:28:46] the types of the of the first
[1:28:49] resurrection he's laying out the types
[1:28:51] of the first coming up in seed coming to
[1:28:54] life in creation and then he's talking
[1:28:57] about the quickening power
[1:28:59] that that that came and was given to the
[1:29:02] first church and now he's coming back
[1:29:05] into it because god always manifests in
[1:29:07] three she's coming back to now there is
[1:29:10] a rising
[1:29:14] of a son
[1:29:17] that's going out over the seed of god
[1:29:21] and bringing it to life
[1:29:23] so never substitute
[1:29:27] religion
[1:29:30] or turn
[1:29:31] this house
[1:29:33] or any other house that you would attend
[1:29:36] into a memorial
[1:29:39] talking about what's happened
[1:29:47] the sun
[1:29:49] s-u-n
[1:29:50] sticks with the seed
[1:29:52] all the way through to maturity
[1:29:58] this s-o-n
[1:30:03] that brought the word of god didn't
[1:30:06] place it in the realms of memorial but
[1:30:10] it's still a shining light
[1:30:13] staying with the seed
[1:30:16] all the way to maturity
[1:30:23] so it's not
[1:30:27] academia
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:32] that's why to me the voice
[1:30:37] is still so important
[1:30:41] and you mark my words
[1:30:44] you mark them strong
[1:30:48] people are
[1:30:50] moving away
[1:30:52] from the continual
[1:30:54] maturing of the voice
[1:31:00] and they're moving towards
[1:31:03] emotion
[1:31:05] and and feeling and and manifestation
[1:31:12] as if the voice has been spoken
[1:31:16] it's a finished work
[1:31:19] and now it's our turn to take it and run
[1:31:23] with what god's given
[1:31:24] i don't believe that
[1:31:26] i believe that that voice is still
[1:31:29] speaking to the seed it's still maturing
[1:31:32] the seed it's still bringing it to life
[1:31:35] and it's right there is the way that god
[1:31:38] provided
[1:31:40] and you can't break it off
[1:31:42] you got to stay with it all the way to
[1:31:45] resurrection and rapture
[1:31:52] all the way
[1:31:54] i'm going all the way i'm going to
[1:31:56] listen to it
[1:32:00] play it to me on my deathbed
[1:32:07] i still believe in it
[1:32:10] i still believe it's working
[1:32:14] it
[1:32:15] had to shine
[1:32:17] it had to be created
[1:32:20] it had to be spoken
[1:32:22] it had to be recorded but it didn't
[1:32:25] finish
[1:32:26] it's still working
[1:32:29] and so as we listen to this
[1:32:31] this first 20 minutes
[1:32:34] this morning and i'll close
[1:32:36] here i want to read a couple of
[1:32:38] statements just this this is further on
[1:32:42] in the message probably a week or so or
[1:32:45] two away
[1:32:48] he said
[1:32:49] and the s-o-n
[1:32:51] has
[1:32:53] got to be
[1:32:55] be revealed again
[1:32:58] in the bride in the last day
[1:33:01] the quickening power has to come
[1:33:05] and quicken them out of these dead
[1:33:08] denominations in creed
[1:33:11] to a living word of a living god
[1:33:17] no it quicken them to new life
[1:33:21] it does the same thing for us now
[1:33:24] notice they were so quickened
[1:33:28] in that quickening power
[1:33:30] it
[1:33:31] he says the quickening power wasn't only
[1:33:33] in their souls
[1:33:35] it was all over them
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:39] so we see that that quickening power had
[1:33:43] come he makes this statement
[1:33:45] he said
[1:33:47] he said and he's talking about the
[1:33:49] little boy rolling with the fisherman
[1:33:52] he said sit down son sit down
[1:33:55] the old fisherman
[1:33:57] quiet you know
[1:33:59] him knowed what he was talking about
[1:34:02] said just wait until the s-u-n comes up
[1:34:06] then we can see where we're at
[1:34:12] you say must i be a methodist a baptist
[1:34:15] a
[1:34:16] pentecostal just wait
[1:34:20] the s-o-n comes up
[1:34:23] we'll see
[1:34:24] where we're at
[1:34:26] he is the word
[1:34:28] wait till you see the word manifesting
[1:34:31] shining across the seed
[1:34:35] the wave sheath
[1:34:37] will see where we're at
[1:34:40] do you love them
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:45] i hope as we go through this
[1:34:48] that it can come back to our remembrance
[1:34:52] even though it's been 50 years
[1:34:55] and time dilutes things
[1:34:58] time changes the story
[1:35:03] look at how many denominations we've got
[1:35:06] look at how many things we got it
[1:35:08] changes the story it changes things
[1:35:13] but and time dilutes it but we've got
[1:35:16] record
[1:35:20] you understand we have something that
[1:35:22] can still
[1:35:23] shine
[1:35:25] and still mature
[1:35:28] and
[1:35:29] and
[1:35:30] you know that's i i i i i share with you
[1:35:34] what i believe because you have a right
[1:35:38] to the
[1:35:39] of your choice of leadership and
[1:35:43] i think any minister that's honest up to
[1:35:46] share with this congregation what he
[1:35:48] believes
[1:35:50] not using the the
[1:35:52] step
[1:35:53] phrases of the message of the hour to
[1:35:56] create a feeling but exactly what i
[1:36:00] believe that's why i play tapes
[1:36:06] that's why i do it
[1:36:08] because i know that that voice is
[1:36:12] the
[1:36:14] s-o-n
[1:36:17] in this resurrection
[1:36:20] this seed
[1:36:22] that brings the light
[1:36:25] to the soul
[1:36:28] it's what god provided
[1:36:30] and i understand if there's a place that
[1:36:32] there's no
[1:36:34] uh
[1:36:36] ability to listen that god's grace and
[1:36:38] mercy can do a multitude of things
[1:36:42] but that's not so with us
[1:36:48] you know it's not so
[1:36:50] with us
[1:36:51] i believe that i don't believe there's
[1:36:53] another move
[1:36:56] of god
[1:36:57] i believe the last move of the church is
[1:37:01] the seed ripening
[1:37:04] in the word
[1:37:06] ripening in the sun coming to maturity
[1:37:10] god working all those things out in your
[1:37:13] life individually
[1:37:15] taking the things out that shouldn't be
[1:37:17] there to maturing
[1:37:20] giving you strength to fight off the
[1:37:22] bugs that you don't need to be petted
[1:37:25] and hybrid that it comes to that time
[1:37:28] where you've got to plant your roots in
[1:37:30] god's word and you've got to be drawn
[1:37:33] and you've got to grow and you've got to
[1:37:35] say i need to produce the fruits i need
[1:37:38] to manifest what i am
[1:37:40] lord give to me what i have need of is
[1:37:43] come down to such a a place where the
[1:37:46] bride has made herself ready
[1:37:50] and you can't get ready
[1:37:55] he'll refer to it i don't know if we'll
[1:37:57] get to it
[1:37:58] in this portion of the tape
[1:38:01] but he refers to us simply
[1:38:03] he says that
[1:38:05] the people today
[1:38:07] in the gospel of the world church he
[1:38:10] says they're preaching
[1:38:12] fiction
[1:38:19] a good fiction writer is someone that
[1:38:20] can make it seem real
[1:38:23] but you can't leave out
[1:38:27] the rising of the sun so as we start
[1:38:32] in this first 20 minutes
[1:38:35] our messenger is going to start laying
[1:38:37] the foundation the comparing of the sun
[1:38:41] in creation
[1:38:42] to the sun that comes up in our day the
[1:38:45] quickening power the bringing of the
[1:38:47] seed he's beginning to lay
[1:38:50] the foundation
[1:38:51] for what that he's telling
[1:38:54] the world
[1:38:55] that they've
[1:38:56] rejected and
[1:38:59] aren't you glad you're elect
[1:39:02] amen you'll enjoy this next
[1:39:05] portion so god bless you i hope you join
[1:39:08] in this study
[1:39:10] with us and with me that you'll get your
[1:39:14] uh
[1:39:15] sermons and you'll read through it and
[1:39:17] go back over at each section at a time
[1:39:20] that you'll pray as we go forward we'll
[1:39:23] probably have visiting ministers in
[1:39:25] between our study
[1:39:28] and we'll preach some evangelism
[1:39:31] but our focus in the next few months is
[1:39:33] to just really take a good look
[1:39:36] at this

[1:41:22] bursts
[1:41:24] with joy because
[1:41:27] there is an easter egg
[1:41:31] we believe that you raised up jesus from
[1:41:34] the dead
[1:41:35] many years ago today and we celebrate
[1:41:38] this memorial day
[1:41:42] and let there come an easter among us
[1:41:45] all today
[1:41:48] may we as disturbance

[1:42:01] setting together in heavenly places

[1:42:17] may it be an easter for them also and an
[1:42:20] exodus
[1:42:22] from sickness onto

[1:42:31] trespass may they live today through
[1:42:34] christ amen
[1:42:36] and we'll praise thee for we ask it in
[1:42:38] his name
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:46] i certainly deem this a marvelous
[1:42:49] privilege this morning to be back here
[1:42:51] in jeffersonville
[1:42:53] indiana with
[1:42:55] this great congregation the church
[1:42:57] packed and standing and around and
[1:42:59] outside and in the lot and ever worried
[1:43:02] to you people on the phones across the
[1:43:04] nation
[1:43:05] the beautiful morning here
[1:43:08] five o'clock this morning my
[1:43:11] little friend
[1:43:12] with a red breast flew up at the window
[1:43:14] and
[1:43:15] woke me up seemed like his little heart
[1:43:17] was bursting
[1:43:18] he is risen
[1:43:24] always thought that this little bird is
[1:43:26] being a friend to me because
[1:43:28] i like him
[1:43:29] as the legend about him says the little
[1:43:32] brown bird saw him suffering on the
[1:43:35] cross for sin and placing
[1:43:38] of course the little bird had no sin he
[1:43:41] didn't have to die for the little bird
[1:43:44] but he flew into the cross and tried to
[1:43:47] pull the nails out
[1:43:48] with his little beak
[1:43:50] and he got his breast all red
[1:43:54] and
[1:43:55] that's the way i want mine too
[1:43:57] as this shield
[1:43:59] of trying to protect
[1:44:01] this glorious thing that he died for
[1:44:06] realizing that our time is
[1:44:09] limited here
[1:44:10] especially for those friends who are
[1:44:13] listening in by this telephone
[1:44:16] i would
[1:44:17] like to call your attention this morning
[1:44:20] to a
[1:44:22] a picture
[1:44:23] at some time a goal
[1:44:25] was taken by
[1:44:28] the
[1:44:31] camera
[1:44:32] of a vision that i had here at the
[1:44:34] tabernacle of leaving indiana to arizona
[1:44:39] where i was to meet in a form of a
[1:44:41] pyramid
[1:44:42] seven angels
[1:44:44] not knowing what would happen
[1:44:47] later when i got there thinking it was
[1:44:49] the end of my life but no one could
[1:44:51] stand the blast and i'm sure all of you
[1:44:53] are acquainted with the story
[1:44:56] and
[1:44:57] then in sabinia canyon one morning like
[1:45:00] this
[1:45:01] while in prayer there had been a sword
[1:45:03] placed in my hand and said this is the
[1:45:06] word
[1:45:08] and
[1:45:09] the sword of the word later the angels
[1:45:12] appeared as was prophesied
[1:45:15] and at the same time a great cluster of
[1:45:18] light left where i was standing and
[1:45:20] moved
[1:45:22] 30 miles high in the air
[1:45:24] and around the circle like the wings of
[1:45:27] the angels and drawed into the skies the
[1:45:30] shape of a pyramid in the same
[1:45:33] constellation of angels that appeared
[1:45:37] science took the picture all the way
[1:45:39] from mexico as it moved from northern
[1:45:42] arizona or the holy spirit said it would
[1:45:45] be standing 40 miles northeast of tucson
[1:45:48] and it went into the air and life
[1:45:50] magazine packed the pictures a mystic
[1:45:53] something way in the spheres where there
[1:45:56] could be no
[1:45:57] moisture where there can be no
[1:45:59] evaporations of anything 30 miles high
[1:46:02] and 27 miles across
[1:46:05] and
[1:46:06] coming right up from where those angels
[1:46:08] were
[1:46:09] now they asked to know
[1:46:11] science the
[1:46:13] one of them in tucson wanted to know any
[1:46:15] significance but i didn't tell them you
[1:46:18] all knew it told beforehand
[1:46:20] but
[1:46:21] it wasn't for them
[1:46:23] it was for
[1:46:24] you and so
[1:46:27] there he spoke to me and said
[1:46:30] the seven seals will be open the seven
[1:46:33] mystery seven-fold mystery of the bible
[1:46:36] has been closed up since the foundation
[1:46:38] of the world will be revealed and we yet
[1:46:41] a humble little group compared with all
[1:46:43] the world we've enjoyed these blessings
[1:46:47] now hearing those mysteries
[1:46:49] marriage divorce serpent scenes all
[1:46:52] these different questions has been
[1:46:54] completely
[1:46:56] revealed to us
[1:46:57] not by man but by god himself let's open
[1:47:01] those seven mysteries of what the church
[1:47:03] was how it was in christ at the
[1:47:05] beginning and how it would be revealed
[1:47:07] in the last day
[1:47:09] and now as this went up
[1:47:11] we have the picture outside on the
[1:47:14] plaque
[1:47:15] but then
[1:47:17] i have the picture laying present here
[1:47:19] if you notice as life magazine had it
[1:47:23] but
[1:47:24] i wonder if my
[1:47:26] audience visible here has ever really
[1:47:30] looked at the picture
[1:47:33] and the way it should be
[1:47:35] you remember i was preaching when this
[1:47:38] vision came
[1:47:39] upon the subject of the
[1:47:42] book of the revelations were
[1:47:44] the old judges
[1:47:46] where we seen jesus in revelations 1
[1:47:49] when we started to open the seven seals
[1:47:51] of the or the church ages rather
[1:47:54] just prior to the opening of the seventh
[1:47:56] seal
[1:47:57] christ was standing with hair like wool
[1:48:01] white
[1:48:02] and i described that to you that the old
[1:48:05] english judges and judges of long ago
[1:48:08] when they went to the bench to be sworn
[1:48:11] in their supreme authority was given
[1:48:13] them they wore a white
[1:48:16] wig as it was over their heads to show
[1:48:18] their supreme authority
[1:48:21] well if you'll turn the picture like
[1:48:24] this and look
[1:48:25] you probably see it in the audience
[1:48:27] it's christ
[1:48:29] see his eyes looking here just as
[1:48:31] perfect as it could be wearing the white
[1:48:34] wig
[1:48:35] of supreme deity and judge of all
[1:48:38] heavens and earth
[1:48:40] can you see his eyes nose his mouth
[1:48:43] just turned the picture from this way
[1:48:45] they had it this way the way it's
[1:48:46] supposed to be
[1:48:48] and can you see it
[1:48:49] amen
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:51] he is supreme judge there's none other
[1:48:54] but him
[1:48:56] and that is a perfect identification
[1:48:59] again a vindication
[1:49:02] this message is the truth
[1:49:06] it's true and making him
[1:49:08] not a third person but the only person
[1:49:12] with the white
[1:49:13] so you see the darkness faces beard in
[1:49:15] his eyes and notice he's looking from
[1:49:18] him comes this light shining on the
[1:49:22] right hand side to which he's looking to
[1:49:24] and on the cross that's where he looked
[1:49:26] to the right or he pardoned
[1:49:29] the sinner
[1:49:31] and the blight of his resurrection
[1:49:34] we still go forth in his name
[1:49:40] i wish this morning
[1:49:42] that i had just much time to stand upon
[1:49:46] these phenomenas
[1:49:48] that's beyond any shadow of doubt been
[1:49:51] proven for the past 30 years the 35
[1:49:55] years right here at this church that's
[1:49:57] down on the river when that same light
[1:49:59] came down here in jeffersonville in 1933
[1:50:03] and spoke those words
[1:50:05] as john the baptist was sent to forerun
[1:50:07] the first coming of christ you're a
[1:50:09] message before run the second
[1:50:12] we're at the end time
[1:50:14] and we see it we wonder sometimes why it
[1:50:16] hasn't spread over the earth
[1:50:18] maybe
[1:50:20] sometime we'll have a chance to explain
[1:50:22] that as god willing now
[1:50:25] i want you to turn in in your bibles as
[1:50:28] we always believe that the word must
[1:50:31] come first of the reading of the word i
[1:50:33] always read that because if my words is
[1:50:37] the word of a man
[1:50:38] it will fail but the word of god can
[1:50:42] never fail
[1:50:43] now
[1:50:45] we're going to to read from the holy
[1:50:48] scriptures a text
[1:50:50] and we want you to turn first
[1:50:53] uh to um
[1:50:56] three places in the bible
[1:50:58] that i have chosen to read from
[1:51:01] one of them is
[1:51:03] in revelation
[1:51:05] the first chapter
[1:51:08] and the
[1:51:09] 17th
[1:51:10] and 18th verse
[1:51:13] this is where he appeared
[1:51:15] with his hair white as wool
[1:51:20] his feet was like brass
[1:51:23] and then i want you also to get in your
[1:51:25] bibles
[1:51:26] romans 8 11.
[1:51:29] i've chosen this morning three places to
[1:51:32] read from the holy scriptures
[1:51:35] for my message today as the lord is
[1:51:37] placed upon my heart for the
[1:51:39] resurrection
[1:51:41] and then i want you to also
[1:51:44] mark 16
[1:51:46] 1 and two
[1:51:48] there i will draw my
[1:51:50] my
[1:51:51] context
[1:51:54] now in revelations 1 18 we read these
[1:51:58] words 17 and 18.
[1:52:02] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:52:06] dead
[1:52:08] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:52:10] saying unto me
[1:52:12] fear
[1:52:13] not
[1:52:14] or i am the first and the last
[1:52:18] i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:52:22] and behold i am alive forevermore
[1:52:26] amen
[1:52:27] and have the keys of death and hell
[1:52:32] and in romans the 8th chapter
[1:52:36] and the 11th verse we read this
[1:52:40] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:52:43] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:52:47] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:52:50] shall also
[1:52:52] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:52:56] that dwelleth in you
[1:53:00] and now in mark the 16th chapter
[1:53:03] the chapter of the resurrection
[1:53:07] the 16th chapter the first and second
[1:53:10] verses
[1:53:14] and when the sabbath was passed
[1:53:16] mary
[1:53:18] magdalena
[1:53:20] the mother
[1:53:21] and mary the mother of gene
[1:53:23] and salome
[1:53:25] has
[1:53:26] brought sweet spices that they
[1:53:29] might come and anoint him and very early
[1:53:33] in the morning the first day of the week
[1:53:37] they came unto the sepulcher
[1:53:39] at the rising of the sun
[1:53:44] now
[1:53:45] my text this morning i want to take for
[1:53:48] a text
[1:53:50] it is the rising of the sun
[1:53:55] and for a subject
[1:53:57] i want to use
[1:53:59] the quickening power
[1:54:03] now
[1:54:06] you know you perhaps have been hearing
[1:54:08] the radio
[1:54:10] and the
[1:54:11] different ministers speak in our
[1:54:14] noble brother neville this morning
[1:54:16] speaking his
[1:54:17] easter subject
[1:54:20] on the resurrection
[1:54:23] and
[1:54:25] i thought maybe i would take it a a
[1:54:28] little
[1:54:29] different path
[1:54:31] not to be different but just to add a
[1:54:33] little more
[1:54:35] maybe in another angle
[1:54:38] or you the scriptures
[1:54:40] every angle you go with the scriptures
[1:54:43] it always declares jesus christ
[1:54:47] you cannot get away from it anyway
[1:54:50] it always declares him
[1:54:53] now
[1:54:54] as the world
[1:54:56] today in a
[1:54:58] a memorial service
[1:55:01] or at least in the united states and
[1:55:02] this side of the earth this morning
[1:55:05] and the churches and throughout
[1:55:07] uh celebrating
[1:55:09] a memorial of
[1:55:12] the greatest triumph
[1:55:14] that man ever had
[1:55:17] i think as
[1:55:19] savior when he died
[1:55:22] or as an infant when he was born he
[1:55:25] could not
[1:55:26] abandon your less being coming into the
[1:55:29] earth
[1:55:30] and when he died certainly he atoned for
[1:55:33] our sins
[1:55:35] but yet there's been many
[1:55:38] fine little babies born
[1:55:41] and there's been many man who has
[1:55:44] suffered and died for a real cause
[1:55:48] but there never was one
[1:55:51] that could raise yourself up again
[1:55:53] until this day
[1:55:56] now that it is the greatest
[1:55:59] week in history
[1:56:01] the greatest celebration of all times
[1:56:05] this easter is where he proved
[1:56:09] what he had said
[1:56:11] man can say things but yet
[1:56:15] it isn't exactly can be
[1:56:17] believed upon thoroughly until it's been
[1:56:20] proved to be the truth
[1:56:23] and it's god who said prove all things
[1:56:26] hold faith to that which is good
[1:56:29] he would not tell you to do something
[1:56:32] that he would not do himself
[1:56:35] so he proved
[1:56:37] who this was
[1:56:40] that died for our sins
[1:56:44] and now not only is it a memorial day
[1:56:49] of all these great easter flowers and
[1:56:53] easter bonnets and
[1:56:54] pink rabbits and so forth that we've got
[1:56:57] into
[1:56:59] and holy celebrations
[1:57:01] which is all right
[1:57:03] but this is not the real thing
[1:57:07] and that
[1:57:08] way
[1:57:10] as people today are trying to say we
[1:57:13] should wash feet once the year on
[1:57:16] on
[1:57:17] uh
[1:57:19] thursday
[1:57:20] and on friday we should take the
[1:57:22] communion and all different doctrines
[1:57:25] that
[1:57:26] they argue about where they should be
[1:57:28] this day or that day or what should be a
[1:57:30] sabbath day or the first day of the week
[1:57:32] or
[1:57:32] all these things are just
[1:57:36] merely tradition
[1:57:39] what good would any of it do you whether
[1:57:42] you had lent or not limp
[1:57:45] if there's no life in you
[1:57:48] it's only a memorial
[1:57:51] which is nothing against it but they
[1:57:53] have
[1:57:54] certainly carried out their traditions
[1:57:57] but left off the main thing
[1:58:00] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:58:03] or how right you are in your doctrine if
[1:58:06] you miss that life
[1:58:09] your won't come up anyhow
[1:58:13] no matter how religious how good
[1:58:15] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:58:17] belong to
[1:58:18] it doesn't matter one thing
[1:58:21] unless you have been born again
[1:58:25] therefore
[1:58:26] if god raised up jesus from the dead
[1:58:30] did he raise him up for a memorial and
[1:58:34] is this resurrection morning only uh
[1:58:37] uh one day in the year
[1:58:39] or a certain day that we celebrate this
[1:58:42] are
[1:58:43] are we
[1:58:44] benefactors
[1:58:45] of his resurrection amen what does it
[1:58:49] mean to me
[1:58:51] what does it mean to you not we believe
[1:58:54] by faith that he raised from the dead
[1:58:58] but what has that got to do with me
[1:59:01] that was 2 000 years ago
[1:59:05] now to find this text
[1:59:07] as i
[1:59:09] was tired
[1:59:11] my arm hurting me from shots
[1:59:15] the nurse gave me for
[1:59:17] leave overseas now as you know in a few
[1:59:19] days
[1:59:22] and um but
[1:59:23] had these shots son and i
[1:59:26] and with collary yellow fever and
[1:59:28] everything i was pretty weary making me
[1:59:31] sick
[1:59:32] which seizure requires to have these
[1:59:35] shots before you go into the other
[1:59:37] nation
[1:59:39] and he said give caesar that which is
[1:59:41] caesar
[1:59:42] but then give god that which is god
[1:59:47] and as i was sitting there wondering
[1:59:50] what would i speak to this waiting
[1:59:52] audience this morning
[1:59:54] which i'm very thankful for
[1:59:57] and men and women who would lay their
[2:00:00] life on the line for what you would say
[2:00:04] how should i do it what should i take
[2:00:07] for a text
[2:00:09] and then while i was sitting there
[2:00:12] almost
[2:00:13] asleep
[2:00:14] my door rattled
[2:00:16] uh out on the front side of the house
[2:00:19] nobody being there but myself
[2:00:22] as far as i knew
[2:00:24] i listened i didn't get it just right
[2:00:27] after a while
[2:00:29] the den room door where i have turned
[2:00:32] into my study
[2:00:33] it rattled
[2:00:35] and someone kept shaking the door
[2:00:38] i went to the door and opened the door
[2:00:42] and to my surprise
[2:00:44] a pretty little
[2:00:47] yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there
[2:00:50] uh
[2:00:51] looked like a little easter flower is
[2:00:53] sitting here looking at me now
[2:00:56] she handed me a card
[2:01:01] and it was the uh
[2:01:03] of course i guess when i get home
[2:01:05] they'll be easter cards and so forth but
[2:01:07] the only one being leaving home that i'd
[2:01:10] received
[2:01:12] and
[2:01:14] she said
[2:01:15] brother branham
[2:01:16] this is from
[2:01:18] daddy and me
[2:01:20] she want to be sure that me was in it
[2:01:24] and
[2:01:25] her arthritic father
[2:01:28] sitting in a wheelchair
[2:01:30] had sent
[2:01:32] this card
[2:01:34] when i took it and thanked the little
[2:01:38] darling as she turned
[2:01:41] and walked away from the door
[2:01:44] i opened up the card
[2:01:47] and in the farm
[2:01:49] of this card
[2:01:50] i drew my text
[2:01:53] for on the card
[2:01:55] was the
[2:01:56] saint
[2:01:57] mark 16
[2:01:59] 1 and 2
[2:02:00] sun up the sun was rising
[2:02:04] and then
[2:02:06] i thought of that and then the subject
[2:02:08] of
[2:02:09] the quickening
[2:02:11] of jesus christ to be raised up from the
[2:02:14] dead
[2:02:15] through
[2:02:15] my subjects
[2:02:18] now
[2:02:20] the sun
[2:02:22] at the rising of the sun
[2:02:26] well
[2:02:27] there was a time when the world was
[2:02:30] laying in utter darkness
[2:02:32] it was without song
[2:02:35] and it was void
[2:02:37] and it was all covered with water
[2:02:42] and was
[2:02:43] laying there
[2:02:44] in this
[2:02:46] dark dismal gloomy
[2:02:49] atmosphere
[2:02:51] and the spirit of god
[2:02:53] moved up on that water and said
[2:02:56] let there be light
[2:03:00] god had a reason to do that
[2:03:03] for down beneath that water
[2:03:07] there was seeds that he had planted
[2:03:11] and
[2:03:12] it had to have that sunlight to make it
[2:03:15] live
[2:03:17] and the first light was ever given in
[2:03:20] the earth was god's spoken word
[2:03:25] the first light that ever struck the
[2:03:27] earth was god's spoken word he said let
[2:03:30] there
[2:03:31] be light amen and there was light
[2:03:34] that turned darkness into light in order
[2:03:38] to bring forth a creation
[2:03:41] of joy
[2:03:43] and life upon the earth
[2:03:46] then the spirit of god as it moved with
[2:03:49] love and compassion at that great day
[2:03:52] the first day of the dawn of creation
[2:03:55] upon the earth
[2:03:57] the sun rose and swept across its rays
[2:04:01] and dried up
[2:04:03] the waters from the earth and made an
[2:04:05] atmosphere above
[2:04:08] and for its first time it was to bring
[2:04:10] joy and life to the earth by a seed
[2:04:14] that was a great
[2:04:16] hour
[2:04:18] but oh it wasn't nothing that's southern
[2:04:20] high
[2:04:21] like the sunrise on that easter morning
[2:04:25] this time
[2:04:27] with the sun leaping into the skies
[2:04:30] it brought forth a greater sunrise than
[2:04:34] ever because
[2:04:35] it came
[2:04:36] greater news with this sunrise
[2:04:40] than it did with the sunrise at the
[2:04:42] beginning
[2:04:44] this sunrise brought a news
[2:04:46] that he is risen
[2:04:52] he is quickened from the dead as he's
[2:04:55] promised he's risen from the dead
[2:05:01] the first time the sun rose in genesis
[2:05:05] it was bringing a message that there
[2:05:06] will be life upon the earth mortal life
[2:05:10] but this time when the sun rose
[2:05:13] there was a
[2:05:15] a
[2:05:16] dual sun rising another sun rising it
[2:05:19] was a not only
[2:05:21] s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n
[2:05:24] had risen
[2:05:27] to bring eternal life to all god's
[2:05:31] promises
[2:05:33] that before knowledge he'd seen laying
[2:05:36] upon the earth
[2:05:38] no more could the the botany life live
[2:05:41] back there at the beginning without the
[2:05:44] sun
[2:05:45] to bring it to life no more than today
[2:05:48] when
[2:05:49] sons of god is up on the earth it takes
[2:05:53] a s-o-n life to bring down to eternal
[2:05:55] life
[2:05:57] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[2:06:00] foundation of the world he had chosen
[2:06:03] them in himself
[2:06:05] before the foundation of the world on
[2:06:07] easter morning
[2:06:09] then in this dirt somewhere
[2:06:12] laid our bodies at that time
[2:06:16] for we are the dust of the earth
[2:06:19] and in heaven there was a book of memory
[2:06:23] and his attributes was in him knowing
[2:06:26] that they're called
[2:06:27] this son of god raised it would also
[2:06:31] raise the life every sun that was
[2:06:33] foreordained to this great time
[2:06:37] he knew it would be
[2:06:39] and what a more glorious sunrise that
[2:06:42] was than it was at the beginning at
[2:06:44] times when it first dawned
[2:06:48] now on this great
[2:06:50] breaking of the easter sea
[2:06:57] you'll just have to come back
[2:07:00] or go home
[2:07:02] and listen to the rest of it over and
[2:07:04] over again
[2:07:06] just in closing let's just run
[2:07:08] back over just the last few
[2:07:14] quotations
[2:07:16] and now the sun
[2:07:18] at that rising of the sun
[2:07:21] well there was eight times paragraph 37
[2:07:24] there was a time when the world was
[2:07:27] lying in utter darkness
[2:07:29] how many times have you heard the
[2:07:31] expression
[2:07:33] we are in total darkness the world's in
[2:07:36] total darkness the the spiritual type
[2:07:39] you know see
[2:07:41] we don't think we're in darkness because
[2:07:43] science keeps testifying of their
[2:07:47] knowledge and their light in their
[2:07:48] technology
[2:07:50] but
[2:07:51] you're in darkness if you don't have the
[2:07:54] revelation of eternal life
[2:07:56] and a life after this
[2:07:59] he says the world light in utter
[2:08:00] darkness so that's a type
[2:08:03] it was without form
[2:08:06] and the world was laid in utter darkness
[2:08:08] without form it was and void
[2:08:12] and it was covered with water
[2:08:14] and was laying there in darkness dismal
[2:08:18] gloomy
[2:08:19] okay aren't we blind miserable poor
[2:08:22] wretched naked and don't know it
[2:08:26] atmosphere and
[2:08:27] believe me
[2:08:28] ladiosa is an atmosphere
[2:08:33] you know what i mean and this atmosphere
[2:08:36] uh
[2:08:37] is uh
[2:08:39] uh has in such an effect
[2:08:42] you know that's what i'm personally
[2:08:43] going through now i'm so dissatisfied
[2:08:46] with the way that i feel
[2:08:49] the way that i think the
[2:08:51] the the spirit that's in me i want to
[2:08:55] break out of that influence of it the
[2:08:57] influence of all these things and i know
[2:09:00] there's only one thing that can break me
[2:09:02] out of that is that hearing that voice
[2:09:05] of life
[2:09:07] just get me through it's just a time
[2:09:09] that i have to go through but i i know
[2:09:12] that there's great overcoming
[2:09:14] it says dismal gloomy
[2:09:16] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[2:09:19] waters and said let there be light
[2:09:22] god had a reason
[2:09:24] to do that
[2:09:27] okay so now
[2:09:29] we understand we're going forward in
[2:09:31] this message he has a reason for sending
[2:09:34] light
[2:09:35] okay and and this is the reason
[2:09:40] that he says
[2:09:42] he had a reason to do that for down
[2:09:44] beneath the water
[2:09:47] or water awful represents what
[2:09:50] people multitudes of people
[2:09:53] okay so down amongst all the people
[2:09:56] and remember earlier he told us he said
[2:09:59] i'm going to explain to you why it
[2:10:01] didn't spread
[2:10:03] worldwide
[2:10:04] because it was only for the what
[2:10:07] elect
[2:10:09] so he says down beneath that water there
[2:10:12] was seed
[2:10:14] that he had planted when did he plant it
[2:10:18] okay that's right before the foundation
[2:10:20] of the world
[2:10:21] and it had to have that
[2:10:24] sunlight
[2:10:25] to make it live
[2:10:28] okay so you're starting to see how he's
[2:10:31] just pressing this out there
[2:10:33] and the first light that ever was given
[2:10:36] on the earth with god's spoken word
[2:10:38] and the first light ever struck the
[2:10:40] earth was god's spoken word he said let
[2:10:43] there be light and there was light
[2:10:45] that turned darkness into light in order
[2:10:48] to bring forth a creation of joy life
[2:10:51] upon the earth than the spirit of god as
[2:10:54] it moved with love and compassion in the
[2:10:57] great day the first day of
[2:10:59] of dawn of creation on the earth the sun
[2:11:02] rose and swept across its rays dried up
[2:11:05] the water
[2:11:07] from the earth and made an atmosphere
[2:11:09] above
[2:11:10] and for this for the first time
[2:11:13] it was to bring joy
[2:11:15] and life
[2:11:17] to the earth by a
[2:11:19] seed
[2:11:21] isn't that strange that
[2:11:23] he put it there
[2:11:25] the joy in the life
[2:11:27] that was brought to the atmosphere into
[2:11:29] the earth came from the seed that was
[2:11:32] planted
[2:11:33] the flowers that everything that came
[2:11:36] forth
[2:11:37] that was a great hour
[2:11:39] but it was nothing like the sunrise at
[2:11:42] the easter morning right we so we read
[2:11:44] that and everything rope up in the skies
[2:11:47] and we wreak he says the first time the
[2:11:49] sun rose
[2:11:50] in genesis it was to bring a message
[2:11:53] that there was life upon the earth
[2:11:55] mortal life now
[2:11:58] this time there's a second message
[2:12:01] right
[2:12:02] that there's eternal life
[2:12:05] well
[2:12:06] the third time this message is what
[2:12:10] he's coming
[2:12:11] he's here
[2:12:13] there's a union
[2:12:15] he's here
[2:12:16] to unite with you to become one with you
[2:12:19] to
[2:12:21] quicken you
[2:12:24] and place in you the very thing
[2:12:28] that's going to change
[2:12:30] your mortal body
[2:12:31] the quickening power that's why i read
[2:12:34] the scripture if the same life that
[2:12:35] dwelt in you dwelt in jesus christ it
[2:12:38] will also quicken so now picture this
[2:12:41] sun rising
[2:12:43] okay so eternal life was now united back
[2:12:47] with man
[2:12:48] every debt was taken eternal life he
[2:12:51] sent his spirit and now this the seed
[2:12:54] goes into the ground now here comes this
[2:12:56] light in our day
[2:12:59] right
[2:13:00] he's testifying of the light he's
[2:13:02] testifying of the eternal life the the
[2:13:06] the world is groping in darkness
[2:13:09] but now here comes another light shining
[2:13:12] proving that he's the same yesterday
[2:13:14] today and forever proving that he's
[2:13:16] coming again and not only the sign of
[2:13:19] his coming that we're at the end time
[2:13:22] but now he's becoming benefactors of it
[2:13:25] and he's imparting back the original
[2:13:30] not a fictional
[2:13:32] not a man-made
[2:13:34] you understand so if the original had to
[2:13:36] come from the light
[2:13:38] which the first light was the spoken
[2:13:40] word the second has to come from the
[2:13:44] spoken word and that's what he was he
[2:13:46] was the what that word that spoke it
[2:13:49] made flat
[2:13:50] and now that word's got to come in us
[2:13:53] that we have that same quickening power
[2:13:56] that was able to speak it into existence
[2:13:59] now it's able to take us to where
[2:14:02] that we're going it's just laid out
[2:14:03] there in just beautiful types and in
[2:14:06] closing uh it's just 12 o'clock we did
[2:14:09] pretty good
[2:14:11] so i'm not going to read too much more
[2:14:12] because i'll get excited
[2:14:15] but maybe you could put this paragraph
[2:14:17] up there paragraph 12
[2:14:20] and uh
[2:14:21] and let's stand together and that way
[2:14:24] it'll help me make sure that
[2:14:31] did you see it unfold
[2:14:34] i mean could you see that how he brought
[2:14:36] about that resurrection how he brought
[2:14:38] back how he brought the things in what
[2:14:40] he's moving towards
[2:14:43] i don't know if that was the right way
[2:14:44] to approach it this morning but i just
[2:14:47] i just felt he says
[2:14:49] listen to twelve and so there
[2:14:51] he spoke to me
[2:14:53] and said the seven seals will be opened
[2:14:56] the seven mysteries the seven-fold
[2:14:58] mysteries of the bible
[2:15:00] that's been closed up since the
[2:15:02] foundation of the world why is that
[2:15:04] important
[2:15:06] isn't that almost him describing what
[2:15:09] the rising of the sun is
[2:15:12] in our day
[2:15:14] the light
[2:15:16] that was going to come
[2:15:18] to take away the darkness
[2:15:20] and put the resurrection quickening
[2:15:23] power the seed is in us
[2:15:26] but it's got to be brought to life
[2:15:28] wouldn't that what he just said the
[2:15:29] sun's got to bring the seed to light he
[2:15:31] said
[2:15:32] unfold the seven mystery
[2:15:34] that's been closed since the foundation
[2:15:36] of the world will be revealed
[2:15:38] and we
[2:15:39] yet a humble little group compared to
[2:15:42] all the world
[2:15:43] we've enjoyed the blessings
[2:15:45] a hearing of those mysteries
[2:15:48] marriage and divorce
[2:15:50] serpency
[2:15:52] in all these different questions
[2:15:54] has been completely revealed to us
[2:15:57] not by man
[2:15:59] but by god
[2:16:01] himself
[2:16:05] all
[2:16:06] church it would take forever and i don't
[2:16:08] have the words to explain it
[2:16:11] the razor thin edge
[2:16:14] between the deity that dwelt in brother
[2:16:16] branham and the flesh
[2:16:22] you know the veil
[2:16:25] and uh
[2:16:27] but it's it's almost inseparable but
[2:16:32] he says the church
[2:16:34] he says
[2:16:35] has been completely revealed to us not
[2:16:37] by man but by god himself
[2:16:41] that's opened those seven mysteries
[2:16:44] of what the church was
[2:16:49] we could certainly talk about what the
[2:16:51] church was
[2:16:53] right
[2:16:55] and how it was in christ
[2:16:58] at the beginning
[2:17:01] isn't it beautiful
[2:17:03] what we've begun to see that we were
[2:17:05] with him in the beginning our names were
[2:17:07] written on the lamb's book of life we
[2:17:10] were in his thoughts
[2:17:11] that that that came to you
[2:17:15] because of the rising of the light
[2:17:18] in the rising of a sun in this day
[2:17:21] everybody else groping in darkness
[2:17:25] well there hope a hope that they might
[2:17:29] but now it's been real revealed to us
[2:17:31] that we're already sitting with him in
[2:17:34] heavenly places
[2:17:36] in christ jesus make it personal to
[2:17:38] yourself
[2:17:39] it's not that hard to explain okay some
[2:17:42] of you that are in school i guess they
[2:17:44] can teach algebra in sixth grade or
[2:17:46] something now or something you've got
[2:17:49] college degrees you've got education you
[2:17:52] can sit back and look at this very
[2:17:54] simple event and can say what the
[2:17:57] prophet is what does that mean to me
[2:18:01] what's it got to do with me
[2:18:04] that was a long time ago what does that
[2:18:06] have to do with me today this is the
[2:18:08] answer to that question
[2:18:10] how
[2:18:11] it was in christ
[2:18:13] of what the church was
[2:18:15] and how it was in christ at the
[2:18:17] beginning
[2:18:18] and how it would be revealed
[2:18:22] in
[2:18:23] the last days
[2:18:25] how it would be revealed how would this
[2:18:28] church
[2:18:29] seed elect be revealed in this last day
[2:18:33] the son of man ministry
[2:18:36] would rise up veiled in flesh and shine
[2:18:39] this light back over the people
[2:18:41] quickening the seed in them bringing
[2:18:44] them to life
[2:18:46] to what they were planted for
[2:18:48] oh emmanuel isn't he wonderful then it's
[2:18:52] just bow our heads this morning

[2:19:00] lord we're so grateful
[2:19:03] though few in number
[2:19:08] lord you said
[2:19:11] but yet you broke the wonderful
[2:19:13] mysteries of life
[2:19:16] you chose every
[2:19:18] person here from whatever walk of life
[2:19:20] they came from
[2:19:22] whatever educational background
[2:19:25] whatever upbringing
[2:19:27] father there was something in them that
[2:19:29] heard the voice
[2:19:31] [Music]
[2:19:33] he said my sheep hear my voice
[2:19:36] and another they will not follow
[2:19:39] lord you know that's been the desire of
[2:19:42] my heart that that becomes steadfast in
[2:19:45] every believer
[2:19:48] that they recognize father
[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:19:56] when things try to take them from it
[2:20:02] lord i just know that
[2:20:04] you love your flock
[2:20:07] and you will not leave them nor forsake
[2:20:10] or through this study as we go through

[2:20:16] endured to what that you've done
[2:20:19] what that you revealed to us father may
[2:20:22] we love it more than we've ever loved it
[2:20:24] before may we understand it in the word
[2:20:27] as it actually being the spoken light
[2:20:30] that was spoken in the beginning
[2:20:33] may father may know all the doubts and
[2:20:35] science and lies of the enemy father may
[2:20:38] they never move us from the steadfast
[2:20:41] revelation that this was revealed to us
