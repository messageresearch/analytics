strengthen our brother matthew who brought the word and lord we are here to serve you and not to serve a man we are here to rejoice in the things which you have revealed in our time and to be reminded of the promise that you made to us that we can come in and stand upon that promise until you come to bring it to pass in our lives lord and we know only that promise will defeat the enemy in our lives oh god help us as we look to you strengthen our bodies and father those that are weak that we may claim our strength even tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen good to be gathered once again in the house of god amen certainly enjoy the word this morning amen thank you everyone for uh praying for us to pray that the lord will continue to strengthen us for some reason last week i decided to go after three and a half months to go get my second covet shot and and it seems like i got the same exact result as i did when i got the first one so i'm glad it's over no boosters that's it amen we thank the lord and amen is certainly good to be in the house of god man let's turn our bibles in psalm 130 amen a very short scripture reading we're going to start from verse 1 it says out of the depths i have cried unto thee o lord out of the depths i have cried unto thee o lord lord hear my voice let let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication if thou lord should hath mark iniquity o lord who shall stand but there is forgiveness with thee that thou may be feared i wait for the lord my soul do it right and in thy word i do hope do i hope my soul waited for the lord more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning let israel hope in the lord for with the lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption and he shall redeem israel from all his iniquity amen aren't you glad to serve that kind of god amen let's also turn to luke chapter uh the 21st chapter and we're going to read and receive a couple of scriptures in there for 21st chapter let's let's start from the 25th verse it says and there shall be signs and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth the stress of nations with perplexity seas and waves roaring says man's heart failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are come are coming upon the earth for the power of the heavens shall be shaken it says and and and then shall they shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your right your head for your redemption draw it nigh amen i would like to if maybe seated i would like to take my title from this verse that we read and i want to call it look up for your redemption draw at night i mean let's turn to uh roman's very scripture reading very familiar romans chapter 8 verse we're going to start from verse 18 it says for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealing us so there's a time where the glory will be revealing us it says that for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in a hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god now verbum uses this and he says because the master failed so did this creation so the restoration of the creation was directly tied to the restoration of the master of the creation so once you restore the master creation comes right back there's nothing that needs to be done with the creation except to raise its master back up and it says for now the whole now we know that the whole creation growneth and travail it in in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown with grown grown within ourselves waiting waiting for the adoption to reach the redemption of our body amen like i said i would like to speak for a little bit but before i go on i just want to say i enjoy the word this morning what our brother matthew was bringing up because we i was thinking about the scripture i believe it's in uh ii samuel the 23rd chapter he speaks about david how that you know he woke up one morning and he desired to drink the water from the weld of bethlehem and he he was working and he just within his heart and he just felt like that water could quench his terrorist he said i just feel like drinking and and if you go read it even the way a prophet speaks about it that very say inspired three men to go and i was checking about it before i came to church i believe barbara says it was about 15 miles of philistine just a cup of water you think about inspiration and you think about something that just a man and this is him a type of christ he just desired and said i just decided to drink all the waters of it like he tasted all the other water if you ever wanted something just the way it was just the way something within its heart is if i could just drink off that water and three of his mighty men walked through 15 miles of the philistine i thought about it and i said what about us oh if we could carry his desire like this mighty man of david just hungered within himself they just he didn't say much he didn't say i sent you to go get me water he didn't say just the fact that he desired it it was good enough for him for them i tell you we we have to come to the place where the word is us when he desires it it's our desire when he wants it it's us that want it when he wants it why because we want the master to be pleased we want him to be at peace we want to serve him with all our heart you know really if you look at it the perfection that we talk about is when the master can actually taste of his own work is after the master can actually come and say well i've worked and i've worked through this vineyard and i've done all that i could and i've worked through the ultra i've done all of this let me taste of the wine of it and see how it tastes when the very elements or the things that he's been working at becomes the things that feed him i pray it's not enthusiasm that we desire as alberta said you know enthusiasm will get you all worked up and everything and you go worked up but the moment you get out of here the moment your mind switches to something else your enthusiasm goes away with it but faith is what has long-range vision like our prophet tells us faith is what looks at and doesn't care faith is what has an objective that can look and say this is what i desire no matter what this is what i'm obtained and it doesn't matter how many how many times you get knocked down faith stays with it wha oh let me say this we we want to stay with it we don't want that kind of experience we get it today and then the next time when we show i want something more i want something i could stay with it i stay with it today i stay with it tomorrow i stay with it the next day something that can keep you something i can walk something you can say you i'm not what i used to be i've been changed and that's forever so i want to speak on like i said look up for your redemption draw is nigh and and as we read the scripture here even in luke it says when you see those things it says look up for your redemption draw it not now i want you to realize he's actually detailing the conditions that will be upon the earth and the things that will be happening around in this particular time but i want you to focus on that one scripture he's not saying look around to what's happening in the world look around to what's happening behind you look around to everything that's happening or the turmoil and everything he's saying at that particular time i want you to look up continue to look up continue to look up and your redemption comes by looking up not by looking around not by looking oh you know perhaps this is going to come down perhaps this will change perhaps that will change no he's wanting you to focus on what's going to come up now when we we look at and we speak about redemption and and i want to say this when we speak about redemption we are talking you know this words and if you go through the bible and through the messages use entertain interchangeably you could talk about redemption the same way you could talk about restoration because it basically brings the same outcome it talks about the same thing uh it basically uh goes to do the same thing with a person so when we talk about redemption one of the things that has to come in mind it's important to realize what is it that we are being brought back to it's redemption it's the restoration but what is this restoration about what is it that we are being brought back to and so in that we have to see what is the pre-existing relationship that was before what is it that we can go back and say this is what it was in the beginning this is what it was this is what the relationship was in the beginning therefore as we're saying we are being redeemed this is the part that we have to see come to play and this is the expected result to say that we have been restored to say that restoration has taken place to claim that restoration has taken place there has to be a pre-existing condition that we can look back and reconcile and say that this is what it was before this is what it had become but the restoration has taken it right back into what it was before so in order to understand that we have to go back we have to understand what was the relationship between adam and god what was even we we could even say from the standpoint of the message we have been taken into the existence of what was in the mind of god before the beginning so we can understand it and why because you cannot go and claim something that you didn't know existed you cannot claim a position that never existed you cannot go into those things and trying to find a position that never was there but with the understanding and the revelation of this hour it gives us the ability for us to go back and say this is what i'm looking for this is what i'm trying to be restored to so and i want to say this you you can you can you can only have something if you had been something before when we speak about redemption or restoration you can only be what you were you cannot become something new something can only be restored into something that was before as a matter of fact i could say you cannot be something that you were not that's right and yes the focus because the the this establishes what the relationship is when we say i'm going to be restored i'm going to be brought back in other in essence the question that's being asked is what was i before what am i being restored to what was i before that's what establishes the relationship and i want to say also this the the when you speak about redemption redemption identifies the origin i i don't want you to lose me there redemption identifies the origin you know i was thinking about even this afternoon you know we we have a song in french i heard it many times when i was younger many times and it says that the evening time identifies the origin of everything and i'll give an example you you take for instance kids and they woke up in the morning they go to school or to the play yard or they go places to play and everything uh you when you realize that when the sun starts to go down it's it's the time for everybody to start looking and thinking about home you you look at the animal kingdom you could see the birds and the animals and all those they will go out hunting and looking for seeds and everything they will go and get the seeds but in the evening time every bird has to know where the nest is what is our resting place every lion or every whatever has to know this is the place where we gather in the evening time this is the place where we're supposed to be in the evening time so once the morning comes they go and they go places they may go as far as they want but the evening time is what determines the origin because the evening time causes them to go right back into where they were before the next day start and i want to say this i'm encouraged by this because when we desire the things of god when especially in this evening time you have to understand redemption could not happen in the first half church ages that was just the opening in fact it was the paying of the price it was the sacrificial lamb and the whole thing and and and the work that was being laid out but it wasn't until the evening time that the claiming has to come where everything has to be returned to the original owner everything has to be returned to the original place where everything has to be set right back into what it was in the beginning so i want to say this the church of the living god that started at pentecost and he came in and he came and he traveled through the whole thing and we find out that in the evening time the prophet is coming back is pointing it right back into its origin he's not coming back and writing pointing it and say well we are here we've gone to sanctification justification this is our identification but no the identification at the end time is the origin of where it comes from oh that's why i began to think you know you look at this world and you look at the things that's happening that's why it's important as we read the bible it says that in this end time this is what's going to happen even as we read in luke 21 this is the condition upon this and this is the condition upon that let me say this the world has identified itself in the scripture and they find themselves in the spirit of it but one of them says that god didn't destroy the earth all it took was for the prophecy to come forth and man finds himself in the condition of the prophecy of the end time but it says that man destroys the earth why because they've entered into the spirit of the end time they've entered into the condition of the end time they have identified themselves to be part of that particular origin they they know that they didn't come from god they they didn't come in fact they claimed themselves to be coming from an evolution and that's what evolution because there's no life in it where therefore the end of it is death so the only thing that goes right back into god is whatever came out of god so the end that's why we when we talk about the book of genesis the prophet tells us it's the c chapter it's a very important book because it shows you exactly where everything came from it shows you how the devil started his work it shows you how god started his work and he shows you how those two seed travel through time and he shows you how they continually begin to manifest how that the seed of the enemy continually tries to kill the seed of god it continually continually tries until the very end therefore when we look in the book of revelation we see those two seeds and we see what the outcome of them is going to be so we could see here we say the prophecy of the end time the world is entered into the spirit of the last day and god is not going to destroy man but man is going to destroy himself and they've entered into the spirit of the last day and they can't help it why because they have no identification in god because they cannot find themselves who they are in god therefore they cannot be restored but we find out at the same time that there's a bride who's entered into the spirit of the prophecy that was written about her how that she was going to do the greater works how that she's going to come and be the manifestation of the written word and in entering into that spirit there is also another manifestation not by those people but by god doing it through them that they can manifest the very word that was promised of them but one of them speaks and this is in a message revelation is speaking revelation chapter 5 and he says now notice it was the lamb it was the lamb redeemer a lamb redeemer just like the first god never changes it says that god never changed amen it says the first redeemer was a lamb in the garden of eden it was a lamb that was offered so he speaks about the skin that god took after adam and eve uh sinned god was the first one to come in and take an animal and kill it and take off the of the the skin of it and dress them up well what was it it was an identification of what was to come so he's saying it was a lamb that was offered and it says in the erie again here again plummet over in the revelation it's again the lamb redeeming what the fallen condition the the fallen condition and the fallen inheritance of the fallen race of people a lamb comes back to redeem like like ours was in the beginning to redeem us listen now he asked to redeem what he says what he's going to redeem what is it what is he going to redeem us about he says to bring us anything that's redeemed is something that's been lost now he's saying this purposely so we understand there's the existing of something there's the losing of something and then there's a redemption so he's wanting to break it apart so we know if you never was lost there's no need for redemption if it was never lost there's no need for redemption so redemption is for something that was lost so because it's lost because it moved it was moved from its original position it's moved from a condition that it was into the beginning and it's moved into another condition it says it's something that's been lost and then it's been brought back again what does he bring us back to what does he bring back to us this lamp it says everything we had in the beginning now i don't know about you i want to know what is everything we had in the beginning we i i just i want to shout but i'm trying to just keep my energy i'm not 100 so i don't want to stop halfway so i'm just going to try to get to the end but but but we we have to understand what kind of believers are we that we we've been called into something and and we've been given an inheritance it behooves us to know what this inheritance was what is it everything what is everything means what is it that's mine oh i tell you when when something has been given to you it's important you you define what it is it's it's important you know the boundaries of it god told abraham i'll give you the earth and i want to say this the earth is yours he says the the however far you can see however wide you can see wherever your foot steps on it says it belongs to you it gave you all the earth he gives you all the stars it says all of this is yours and then so now the prophet is telling us is everything that we had in the beginning now let me continue on what is it it says what did we have at the beginning oh i love this he says eternal life we was heir of the world this world belonged to us god didn't create the earth for himself he created the earth for you he gifted up to adam he created adam to be his reflection on earth so he can be the god of all the universe but adam was the one the earth was given to the title deed that was made had adam's name on it and nobody else not even god had his name on it when he made it he wrote it for adam and he gave it to him that's why when it was lost it went back to the original owner and the original owner never needed it in the first place and ever since he's been working to try to give it back to the son that he promised he was going to give it to and and everything what is everything the earth eternal life we had he says we had life oh my i tell you this is not life if you think this is life you are mistaken this is death and we perspire we die we get sick today and well tomorrow and we eat and we constantly eat and we have to eat to keep this body going and we get weak and we get tired and we get dead i don't want this life you can take this life as much as i'm concerned what i desire is to have that life because i know if i have life that life you can take this life but i will never die he says he says we had life we never had to die we never have to be sick we never had to get old we never had any worries he says where there was no funerals no grave no evil no death no grave no gray hair no stooped up shoulder no mourning no crying we have we had life and i say give me that kind of life and it says eternal life we had just we we we had the the jurisdiction over the earth we was we was god he says uh minister of god he said on the earth walked about and if they if the tree didn't look right standing there we said be thou plucked up and set over here and it would be and it will do the winds was blowing we didn't want the winds to blow peace be still and he did it what are we being restored to what is this redemption about what is it that we desire let me say my brother my sister let's not be mistaken god didn't save us so we could just sit here and say praise god i'm saved i have the holy ghost and and i'm gonna go to heaven and everything and i say if that's all you desire you're nearsighted let me just help you a little bit even as a math what matthew said let's just there's more into the kingdom of god than just not me me not being sick and immoral or having my next meal and as a matter of fact he's trying to let you know that you don't even have to go through all of that because all of this belong to you imagine a man who owns the the cattle and who homes the the the the the houses and everything and he comes in and and he's acting like a beggar oh you know can i have ten dollars they'll look at him you are full all of this belong to you he says he says which says blow it says to redeem us it says to redeem all that back to us again he says oh oh oh my get all that back again he continues on and he says and now nature itself is groaning waiting to what to the what to the manifestation of sons of god the sons of god to be manifested and we have the earnest of our salvation now now look at what he's pointing to now he's speaking about the holy ghost that we have been given so the earnest is something to show you that there's more to come the earnest is the down payment it's not the full payment it's the down payment to show you look at what you have today what it can do but how much more when you have the fullness of it how much more can you do so when you receive the earnest a person who receives the earnest there is a need or desire for him to receive the full payment the earnest requires or shows that there's a full payment coming the earnest it's an appetite the earnest is something that puts you under expectation for you to know that there's more coming but now if you're not careful people become content with the earnest well you know i don't care have you ever been you've been you know somebody owes you a million dollars and they give you ten dollars you're like you know you know i'll just content with the ten dollars now you know i don't have to worry about no he's saying no no no don't have that attitude the earnest we have believed and listen to what he says the earnest of our salvation now it says and can take our brother that's dying with cancer listen to this the earnest itself can take our brother that's dying with cancer and stand him up a little breath of redemption and pray and pray and prayer of faith over him will turn the shadow of a man back to health again a man again what will what will we do with our full possession the earnest is not given for you to be satisfied and walk away the earnest is given for you to know there's more coming is given for you to say i have received my earnest i have received the taste of it and i want more let me say this we cannot be restored back to our full position unless we can know what is it that we are being restored to unless we desire to be restored to unless we seek to know what is it that we are being restored into i have received the earnest what is this earnest tell me i don't like this life i don't like the the things of the world i don't like this the earnest tells me i'm gonna be put into possession where i'm gonna be overcoming my life i'm gonna have overcoming power over sin i'm gonna have overcoming power over the devil that i am going to be speaking god's word and it's going to come to pass the earnest is telling you look at adam when he didn't like the way that the wings blow he could say wind stop when he didn't like the places that placing off a mountain he could tell the mountain move down here and go over here and i want to say this we are in the perfect condition for this thing to come to pass why because god has pledged you here and no doubt every one of us sitting here you have mountains and you have things and you have situations and everything the earnest is speaking to you at this moment and telling you that you can change those things the earnest is not there saying be content just walk keep your head down the anus is saying you were built for more than death you were built to be a son and the daughter of god you are given possession over the earth and as a matter of fact those people that are telling you what to do they are the ones working for you we got the position twisted oh what is my boss gonna say and we tremble are you adam's race are you the king the the seed of abraham who are you when we say we need to know who we are i wonder how many times that goes over our head because we think what we are or who we are we think about oh you know this great power of standing and everybody looking at you and saying i want this and in the whole earth tenders no it's in simplicity that god reveals himself it's you coming into a position where you understand what god's desire is you understand what he wants you to do with the word and you're saying that this circumstance should not be and therefore i speak the word issue change and in order to get into that situation we need to be obedient to the word that brings us into that situation now he continues on and he says nature knows that it says nature nature knows that nature is groaning and we are groaning with it nature is waiting for the manifestation of sons of god because nature because nature was cursed with his master when its master was cursed the highest then nature fall with a master but it says but when the when this kingsman redeemer comes hallelujah and redeems us back and redeems the man back the master the master over nature then all nature is waiting for the man the master it says it says what do we do he says we take the axe and slip it and slip it in our hands and chop the tree down if we want if we want to but but it says but that day won't be one but but that day we won't do that all nature is waiting for his master and the master is the son of god and was given this earth now god god will have his heaven of course but this was given to man and the kingsman redeemer come to redeem us back to what we lost what a beaut what beautiful how beautiful i think it says a lamb redeemer when the work is finished we have all kinds we have all things again what kind of things we have all power we have all eternal life we have all eternal health we have all eternal youth we have all eternal power we have just we are just eternal as as with the eternal then we are waiting for what we are waiting for what time to come waiting and groaning so there he is in the same what is it and i thought that was such a a marvelous uh understanding of what is it that we are being moved into we we're not being moved to where we just say praise god i'm safe from sin into i'm safe from sin i move from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light praise god i'm no longer a sinner that's why i'm saying this redemption the first part of redemption was to pay the price but the part the second part of this redemption is for the full price that was paid that the claiming work may come to pass and if you think about the claiming work the book that it takes you to is the book of joshua where you can understand that here they are they walked into the promised land and it was upon them to go in and know what is it that's in this land of possession that belonged to me and i want to say this it's not to wait until we get to heaven then find out what is my inheritance because most of us think oh i'm going to claim everything then when i get on the other side that's not what the scripture says the scripture is telling us that in this earthly tabernacle we will overcome the sin we will put our head over the devil we will walk over deadly things that will manifest the works of god in this body not in the new body but in this body and therefore we have to come to the place where those are the things that we are seeking because the understanding is i am not here to project darkness i've not been sent here to be an instrument to darkness but i'm here to project light and the kingdom of god i'm here to project the kingdom of my father i'm here to take possession to what been rightly given to me but when it talks about something being in a pawn shop listen to this it says now if christ was standing here the lord jesus in a corporal body like mine i love when he does this because you know exactly where he's leading you he says wearing the suit here i want to ask you now be careful now how you answer if christ was standing here in a corporate like mine and this woman needed healing she comes she comes to him she comes to him and he said lord will you heal me now be careful could he do it he says he was he has already done it is that right how many knows that he's healing is a finished work now oh i want us to just soar above the things of the world and come into the realization of what's really happening here he is now he's demonstrating before us what the plan of all redemption is all about the plan of redemption is about something that was lost and now it's been redeemed but yet man has not taken possession of it and now he's here in the second time in the first time he was here to pay for the work that's why the prophet could say if he was here standing here after he already paid the price now he's saying here if he was standing here he could not pay the price because the price was already paid it wouldn't help for him to go back and say oh sister dear i'll pay for the price again why because the price was paid now we're saying you need to move from here into another dimension into another position where you understand that the price has been paid and now i'm only here to receive what's rightfully mine we're not gathered here as beggars those that will come and crawl on our knees and say god please and god please please do this please do this no that's not the kind of relationship he's establishing in the end time he's called you bride for a reason he's called you sons and daughters for a reason he's called you those things so you can approach him as such now imagine your wife approaching you as a servant you will look and find out what's going on what am i missing here what have i done wrong does she not understand her position does she not understand what she is there to does she not understand what belongs to her does she not understand the position that she's been called to oh she ended with boldness why because she understand that i have been chosen i am part of this redemption work and let me say this redemption doesn't stop just that jesus christ it's the continuation word that he does even in his bride it's not a new work it's the same work continued he says now he says be careful he says it was the finished work it says then if it says if you had something in the pawnshop and you went and redeemed it he says could it be redeemed again he says it's already out of the pawnshop you just have to recognize it is that right it says that's the way his salvation salvation is the same way it says he was wounded for our transgression with the stripes we are healed is that right then what we what would christ do if it was if if it's the same yesterday today and forever if he would say it's so he he says i've already healed you when i died for you he's now telling her he's now telling them what christ would tell them today if he was standing here in their midst he's now telling them that he's not going to go and say well it looks like my work was not good enough let me go see and see if he could work up a little more no he will tell them i've already done it he says but now what could he do he could tell you what the father would tell you about her he says is that right it says he will do the same thing tonight like he did then then he's the same is that right now let us pray it says the next paragraph now in now this is a different message identification it says look to show that he's the one who brought who to show that is the one that he taught he starts he's the christian today he's taught before the foundation of the world he says now remember man when he was born in sin trumpet iniquity came into the world speaking light is that right the congregation say amen there is nothing in him at all so you see if you was in god's thoughts when he when he came into the world he's come he says in god's thought at the beginning to display his attribute do you follow me then he says then jesus came to break the cloud back so that attribute could display itself if you were a thought in the in god's mind you were an attribute in him and all that jesus has come to do is to break the cloud of sin that came upon you so you can display that attribute that already existed now he says is god's expressed word now nothing else could be manifesting other character had fallen then see where did jesus come to bring back those character no they were born in sin shaped in iniquity he came as a redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring it back amen it says bring it back it says bring it back in god's thought you think it says you think about what he says now think you it says little you little me no one in the world could take my place nobody can take your place you being a christian and filled with the spirit of god and before the foundation of the world see you and he knowed you every feature that you got see jesus came to bring you back that's what jesus was here for redeem a human body to bring you back that's what he's come to do that's what he's come to do the human as a redeemer to display his attribute as a savior to come he says to come to redeem you and bring you back where you were from where you were from where you were from he says now let me say this again we we it's it's important as we read as we read about the relationship of adam and eve or the relationship rather between god and abraham because to us it's the revelation of what we are being restored into amen when we read that revelation of what adam and eve relate at god and adam because remember when we when you go read it it talks about adam the god of the earth he said he created adam in his image in the image even as we read this morning it came and he breathed upon him the the breath of life the life that was in adam came from god and he talks about created in the image he was created both male and female and he came in and god puts him to sleep so that out of adam he can bring the mystery which was eve while adam was sleeping typifying when christ was dead that eve was gonna that the second eve was gonna come out of adam when adam was asleep and there he comes and he shows those things now that relationship becomes very important because it's a description of what relationship we are being entered into if we if we fail to understand that relationship then we fail to understand what is it that belongs to us and i want to say this part of that relationship or the redemption is for us to come back and say that whatever is needed within the relationship that we have now and god that we want to improve it into that relationship amen that's right you know we come here and like i said we we have natural desires god didn't place us here so we can play just the role of his servant to where you know god we need this and god we need that now he is wanting in the same time to display something that's never even been displayed since the beginning he's coming to the place where his very fullness is being manifested into a people for them to come to a place where they understand that they are instruments of redemption not just the individuals that are placed here that can track the origin back to their parents and their grandparents and and what country they are from and what parents under you know we take we we we like those things to know i'm from here i like this and this is everything about me and all of that but god wants us to be elevated from those things and come into the relationship where you understand i'm here more than my natural birth more more than my natural origin i need to be able to track my origin back into god and be able to know what is it that i'm explaining or what is it that i'm displaying in the same time and and i want to say this too because the the existing of that relationship where where we were what we were thinking before and and he could where he can come and and and adam could come in and and and we can see him come and and and subdue over the creation and speak over those things and everything it's a type of us overcoming the things of the world it's a type of us using the word of god to subdue the things around us and and i want to say this it doesn't mean we'll not say it to the creation but it's a further extension of that little because remember here's the thing you know the scripture says who ye that are faithfully little will be faithful in much the the the scripture god wants to walk with us you know we don't we are not born as mature christians we are not born as mature christians from day one we start as a baby step to where we learn to overcome the things in our lives we learn to overcome by the power that he has given us we learn to overcome by the holy spirit until a position has been given unto us where we can do what he desires us to do but each with an understanding that i have a role to play in this work of redemption you have a part to play and and i want to say this like he said it doesn't matter how little how big you are it's for everybody now let me skip this and read this because i thought this really blessed my heart you know and it says this this is the prophet speaking in the message why christ speaks now i want you to just capture the very language of how he's saying this and and even the very vocabulary of how he's saying it he says many times when we look at the scripture in our own way we look at it and it seems very hard he says but if we study it a little while we find out that the old wise god knows just exactly what he's doing he says and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man and then he says he knows what's in man follow me and he he knows him he says and we don't we only know we know we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man we know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in man now listen to this it says moses was born in the world and a gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment but it was born equipped born in him as every man is as he was born with equipment born in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment and then it says and i have as and and and as i firmly believe in the full knowledge of god and the predestination now think about this moses didn't do what he did by accident the prophet is trying to clearly even as we talk about this redemption this redemption didn't come by christ just deciding i'll die for the sin of the world i'll die for the whole world so they can love me so they can appreciate me and all those things no in the purpose of redemption when he comes and is dying he knows exactly who he's dying for who's he dying for he's dying for the people that have that have been equipped he's not dying for the whole world he's dying for those that have been equipped and he says we don't know man but god knows what he's doing and therefore he says he has this equipment within him and therefore i say and then he says every man that is born he says so is every man that comes into the world where is with us equipment what equipment god placed within you his equipment so you can perform his job oh i tell you i began to think about the woman at the well when jesus met a woman at a well look at all the reputation was around that she was a prostitute and she was this and she was dead but yet when jesus came he never mentioned anything about that and in fact the scripture says i have need to go to samaria what was happening the equipment was calling it was time to go meet the equipment and put it in motion when he came and he met a woman who was caught in adultery they came and after they all desperate jesus looked at her and said where are they accuse her he never called her any names he just asked where are the accuser and she speaks about he says there's none left but you it says neither do i condemn you why because he came following the equipment that was within the man therefore you have to understand today that as you are you are born with an equipment you can call it whatever you want just know that i believe this message i believe this word because i have been equipped to believe it i have been equipped to follow it i have been equipped to listen to it and not just to listen to it to follow it but i have been equipped so that this equipment will put me into motion to manifest the works of god the works of god cannot be done without the equipment the works of god what can never be performed without his equipment oh he says one place he says isn't god marvelous here he is you are chuckle bed and detects the baby and it says i believe it's in the message uh if i'm not mistaken i'll probably just uh say it now i i probably won't get back to it let me just say now i believe he preaches a series of message uh the power of god the the the the power of god the power of decision and the power uh uh redemption by power redemption by blood and redemption in completeness and now he speaks and he says the devil always brings his power first he's always there to intimidate the first thing that comes out every time that god wants to do something the devil hops in first he comes and he comes with the power of deception a powerful intimidation and and we can sum up all the works of the devil but him says he only has the power of death in other words the the best that he can do when all is said and done is to bring death but now we know that the power of the blood has come and removed the sting of death into death in other words it's caused death to lose its power the power that death has to hold the believer where you could no longer see god or where you were sealed up in eternal lost and and everything but we understand the power of god when the the power of the blood came and manifested he came and he removes the sting of death therefore death for a believer it became a transition into the presence of god so think about it so therefore when you meet the devil today all that he has is bluff all that he has is deception all that he has is trying to use your power against yourself because his power that was the power of death has been taken away from him now but when i'm speaks again about the power of decision or power of faith he says now the power of faith is the power that looks death and he sees the resurrection it's the power that looks something that's completely dead but believe in a living god who can come and restore life right back into something and bring it right back into the condition that it was in the beginning it says he says now listen to this it says now job in the bible job in the bible he says who was keeping down the mark just for a moment not knowing exactly what the holy spirit will do that night it says we do not understand the way he works he works in mysterious way he's wanted to perform now skip a little bit it says job the oldest book in the bible was supposed to even be written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption listen to this and yet redemption was far far before that redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was ever before the plan of god was laid out before the world was even never formed god didn't create a seed so he can lose it in somebody else's hands he didn't make his kingdom so his kingdom could be brought to not and so he could be left and say how am i gonna get my kingdom back he's telling you before he can even think about anything redemption was the very foundation god i tell you when you read the bible it just bleeds redemption every chapter it talks about how people have left you can read the whole bible from genesis to revelation it will come and condemn people how they have left god and went into the other gods and everything but yet the next chapter will come back but if you will turn unto me i will do this for you i will do this to you but if you return unto me what is it is screaming redemption every chapter it's redemption it's redemption it's redemption why because that's what god is is a redeeming god it's a god who can never lose what belongs to him if he ever done something one way he will continue to do until the very end he's a redeeming god he's the god who at the very end of it the celebration is not going to be how strong we were or how it's going to be the marvelous grace of how god played his redemption throughout the whole bible so he says think of it think of that god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before they ever was made the world for the bible plainly says that christ was predestinated for ordained and was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world that's right way before the world was made god had a plane of redemption and i know i won't be able to get through all of this one of the things when you read especially in the message everywhere you go and you read about redemption especially in the message bharanam will continually speak about the story of boaz in root and i probably won't have time to go through all of it because i don't want to be too long but i'll probably just give a summary of the he speaks about continually about the four stages that root has to be in in the process of redemption typifying the process how we are being brought back in he he says the first stage that root had to make a decision and i i don't want to i hope we all know how many knows the story of fruit looking i mean we we are masters in the bible by now you know i i joke that you know i'm one of those people that i always feel bad that you know to go preach you know someplace i have to be mindful because i tend to rely so much on what we know you know i i don't break it down i just summarize and move forward too quickly so um so he he speaks about the four stages we understand she was a moral right and yes she is and and she was to come but then after all the sons died we understand that he that she had to make a decision whether she was going to go with naomi or not and and bermudem says she had to make a decision and so is every christian has to make a decision now i'm talking about redemption you you have to make a decision what origin you're going back to she could identify herself as a moabite by her natural birth but yet through her marriage she could identify as part of the israel lineage so she had to identify and look at ourselves and say am i still a moabite am i still going to go back to my lineage of what my natural birth was or am i going to follow after that which has been revealed to me that which i have received by marriage oh that's why i like when he speaks about invisible union your first husband had to be killed why because he wants you to identify with the second marriage not your first husband not to by the natural birth that you came in but he had to identify with the second birth but the second marriage and say this is how i decide to go it's a decision that everyone sitting here has to make you know i i thought about you know as our young people you know i'll say this and perhaps for the older folks it's not that much of a challenge but for young people you know you have to make a decision am i going to be a christian or am i going to be try to satisfy both the world and be a christian you know i i see a lot of people oh you know i want to be a youtube star but yet i want to be a christian i want to be a hollywood star but i want to do just christian movies i tell you you you think about you think as a young person there's no end it's like trying to find the borderline of what is it that i could do without falling too close too close stay in the land stay in the land stay as far back as possible that's how you make it the more you come closer to those things the more you will fall because you'll get to a confusing line when you don't know the difference between the two and that's where the devil like to gets people on you know how am i going to become an undercover agent still be a christian how can i satisfy both the world and still satisfy god how can i follow my ambition become a a president and the ceo of a major corporation oh i tell you as people in the corporate world you realize those things are not mutually exclusive how can i become this great person over here in the world what everybody knows who i am but at the same time still be a christian i tell you the place that you can be comfortable is the place where god places you it's not a place where you seek for yourself in other words when you go choosing the first question that has to come to my mind is how do i serve my god in what i'm choosing how do i serve my god in the position that i'm choosing how do i keep my line correctly how do i pick as a christian and know that this is not going to compromise me i tell you life tries to compromise us every day you know and as all the folks we only stick to what we know if we don't know we don't step into it you know how about you try this no i don't know nothing about that i'll stay out here how about this no no no no no no i've seen enough deception you're not going to get me on that oh but i tell you in the kingdom of god god wants to move us with him he wants us to trust his spirit he wants us to lead him he wants us to be led by his spirit he wants us to know what the word says about us and move into it but the devil is the one who always creates the border line you know but one of them speaks about having enough holy ghost not to sin not to do wrong not to say anything bad and you know and and and satisfy with it no that's not the position of the bride as a matter of fact let me say this i hope this doesn't shock anybody there's a major distinction between salvation and redemption salvation there will be those that will be saved at the white throne judgment but redemption is bringing into a position that already existed salvation is bringing you into a place where you know the sons of zebedee say why don't you place one of my sons to my to your left and to my right and the mother came and asked jesus and jesus looked at him and said that place is for a predestinated group of people and not predestined a group of people is you that are sitting here this morning this kingdom belonged to you he gave you the earth he gave you the earth so you can walk on it so every time you come across challenges don't let the challenge become greater than your possession he says one place and i don't know if i have it in my notes it says the power of the devil came in as moses was being brought up there was nothing but the power of death all across and i'm paraphrasing because remember all the babies were called to die and the power of death is telling the mother in her head saying i have been commanded by the king to swallow it up and kill every baby but the power of faith says this baby was born a proper child this baby was given to me by god this baby was promised to me by god therefore i'm going to put him in this i'm going to put him in this little basket and i'm going to place him on the water i'm going to send him to death with faith that god who gave me this child is able to protect him my brother my sister to pray over our loved one to do all those things it's not a complicated matter it's just to find ourselves in the scripture and begin to claim that which belongs to us and let god move on the scene the devil likes to complicate things so that's over this is over i mean oh my goodness it's gotten you don't know how far it's gonna go i don't care how far he can go i know a god a god of restoration one who can bring something in the condition that it was in the beginning in fact he can bring it without a scratch they took the rod of aaron and they put it in the holy of holies now think about this this rod was dead this rod had no else of life in it but because it was standing in the presence of almighty god he began to buzz and reproduce fruits and everything why because god is the god of life it's the god of restoration if the musician could come now he speaks about the type of let me just read this he speaks about the believer's identification he says oh this really blessed my heart i hope i could just read it all the way it says and to be a true believer we have to be the same he says we don't we don't want to forget that it says all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him he says notice he is in me he is and i in him notice then every christian that's real genuine christian was with him and he says when the morning star sings together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realm with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed was back i was back with him and i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning star sings together the sons of god shouted for joy i was with him when he called abraham at the age of 75 years old that's strong how was i in him how was i when he called abraham now we have to understand the economy of god is not one that something happened outside of the other god is not true god is one god god that's why the scripture says if god ever done one thing one way he will continue to do the same because it's part of who he is therefore when he called abraham every seed of abraham come out at the same time that's why he could say when they cross the red sea we cross with him you say well how was that he's not talking about this natural body that came by way of sin he's talking about the overcoming power that caused them to cross the red sea he's talking about the the life of god because remember his life is the eternal life whatever that was in them whatever instruments that was in them whatever equipment was in them that caused them to do what they did that caused them to come out of what they came for that equipment is god and the same god is operating the same equipment today and it says it continues on he says and stood i was with him in his temptation i was there with him when he went up to the top of the mountain it says i offered up isaac when he came to offer up isaac we were there that's why now think about this he's relating this to when the sons of the god shouted for joy in other words there was a time before all of this could take place where we had knowledge of everything that was going to come to pass [Music] now what what what message is he speaking is speaking in the message spiritual amnesia spiritual amnesia in other words we've forgotten these things as we move along but the identification of the end time is that look you're not here now now think about oh when he's speaking about the modern eagle he says the mother eagle knew that he had a baby somewhere he had laid an egg somewhere in other words that egg was the nature of an ego within it so all it took was for the shout to go out for the ego to recognize the mother's voice and to come back if you ask that ego are you an eagle no what do you know about the eagles i don't know what you're talking about do you know how to fly in the heavenlies i don't have you ever tried why would i even try that the nature within that ego was bound to what he knew from the earth of what it was being taught scratch here scratch there scratch here scratch there scratch here scratch there get a little green here get a little in fact the eagle was told if there were ever gonna come a time we know there's this great bird that comes above the sky but every once in a while it will make a scream and if you hear that scream run and hide that's the message the eagle was being taught that's the church under the eagle was sitting run and hide but oh my when that eagle heard the sound for the first time instead of running and hiding that the sound made a sense to him when you heard the message of the hour when you heard the voice of the seven angel they told you just as the man don't follow a man don't listen to a man delicious man's understanding this is just man's these people are lost they're worshiping men and all those things but you hear something within you an equipment identifier he didn't come and took your wings and say fluff it now no he says fly you're like i don't know how to say fly he said i don't know how to he says you were born an eagle you were born to fly you were bound to be just like me you were born to be just in my mind just like i am i am here to bring your redemption and i want you to follow exactly what i'm doing and the eagle tried the first time he crashed probably try the second time he crashed but oh my he kept trying and kept trying and pretty soon those wings just opened up and the witch just blew him up in the air what is that redemption there was a nature of an english in him and there's nothing that could stop him from being an ego [Music] there's not a nature there's nothing that can stop you from being a son of god you breathe it you talk it you you perspire it everything within you desires to be the son the daughter and all he's doing is come i have more for you like brother matthew was saying come up higher i need you to fly a little higher i need you he says look up for your redemption journal look to me look up to me watch what i'm doing and follow the same thing why because just as i'm an eagle so are you let's all stand tonight [Applause] his identification in us where could we go where else could we go what are the words could we listen to it's you that has the eternal life when we hear it it takes us into the heavenly places we are sitter together with you oh god that's the understanding we receive from this word we're not here to scratch around and find the grain here and then scratch a little more so you can find another grain you know i told you there's still identification this is the identification of what the world is following but then there's the identification that comes from him that adam could look and say look at even say this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my born and then adam god could look at adam and say i have created you in my image well because remember we talked about the harmony that existed how did adam know what to name the animal now i'm talking about what we are being returned into i don't know about you but i'm curious to know because that's what i'm being returned into i'm i'm curious to know how did god communicate to adam this is a this isn't this animal this is a lion this is a bear you know i brother jackson would joke about a bear can only bear a bear you know when i was a young preacher that's the first thing i say i ever said you know a bear can only bear bear you know so here he is the identification how did he know what those animals were how did he know how to call this one a lamb and that one a lion and all those things how did evil know that it was a blood sacrifice that was due there was such a connection between gods and the seed there was such a connection between god and these people and i say that's what we desire we don't want to hear it from a preacher we don't want to hear it from somebody else we don't want to hear it just from the time i want to hear from god i want to when i hear the message i want god to speak to me directly so i can come in that kind of fellowship what did you say how did you say it so that i can get in that kind of relationship you know people have this oftentimes we look at the manifestation of sons and yes we will see those things but it begins with that relationship to understanding how were they connected now we know that he was a god he was created in the image of god in the fellowship with god and god placed in him but yet there was a communication where god could look down and say i like this this is the name that's wonderful this is this that's wonderful i said god please enter me in that kind of relationship where when i do something you can look and say that's my child that's me that's my representation i don't have to guess work but i have to know what the word says and what he wants to do with the word so i can enter into it let's just pray our gracious father we so thank you lord lord this world is not our home and we desire to be taken into that closeness of relationships go then where the mighty god can come and be unveiled before us where we can actually do the works of christ and know that's he to him in us doing the same work that he promised god i know as we gather here we have desires we have things that are going on we have our children our young ones and our teenagers and people caught up into the vortex of the world that's out there presenting every opportunity load that seemed to be right but we know those things will lead you further than you need to go lord we ask that you allow a sloth to recognize our positions as brothers and sisters and as mothers and sons and daughters lord where we could come in and speak your word and say i have been made with an equipment and that equipment allows me to call upon the kingdom of god to come in into action lord now to merely just scratch and scratch scratching scratching lord every good man will never desire his wife to be scratching and while he has the possession of everything and we know it's the same with you you don't desire your bride to be one that will beg and beg and bargain but you desire your bride to be one that will be representative of you lord above all you want her to have your mind so she can understand how you work and what you desire done with your word and lord we pray that you bring us into our relationship it's first relationship then your works will follow lord and i pray that you help us get into that lord because we know that your word is here to position us into the place where your full maximum power can come and flow through us we thank you we commit everyone into the hand your hands it we pray that any need that's represented here lord may you touch his hand and answer to the need lord bless the people as we commit ourselves to you we ask those things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen let's just sing
