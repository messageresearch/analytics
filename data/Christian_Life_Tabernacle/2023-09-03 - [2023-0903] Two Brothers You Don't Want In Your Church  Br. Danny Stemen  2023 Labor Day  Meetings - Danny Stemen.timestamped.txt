[14:08] name amen
[14:10] you may be seated
[14:11] for those who are visitors we
[14:16] get together and we read a Psalm every
[14:18] Sunday
[14:20] this morning we're going to be reading
[14:22] one that probably Everyone Knows by
[14:25] heart
[14:26] we sing about it we sing the words of it
[14:30] in fact if you were here on Friday night
[14:33] brother Danny even preached from it a
[14:35] bit
[14:36] and it's psalm 34.
[14:39] just a wonderful chapter
[14:42] you know in the verse that just has been
[14:44] kind of on my mind in the last few weeks
[14:47] is
[14:48] well known to us it's verse eight
[14:51] it says o taste and see
[14:54] that the Lord is good
[14:56] blessed is the man
[14:59] that trusteth in him
[15:02] as David says taste and see
[15:05] taste it
[15:07] and see for yourself
[15:09] that he is good
[15:12] you know have you ever tried
[15:15] to get someone to taste something
[15:18] that you think is good
[15:21] you know sometimes you'll have maybe
[15:23] somebody that's adventurous and say sure
[15:25] I'll try it wow that is good maybe it's
[15:27] your favorite dish maybe it's something
[15:29] you try at a restaurant that is just
[15:31] really delicious
[15:33] you know and sometimes you offer a bite
[15:34] to someone and they taste it and
[15:37] they kind of turn up their nose a little
[15:39] bit and go well
[15:41] that's not my thing that's kind of weird
[15:43] and then you've got those that you
[15:45] offered them a bite
[15:47] and they stare at it and they
[15:49] squanch up their nose and like
[15:52] I don't know if I want to try that
[15:54] they haven't tasted it
[15:56] they're kind of afraid to try it
[15:58] they're not sure if they're gonna like
[15:59] it
[16:01] you know you're like but you haven't
[16:02] tasted it yet I don't know if I want to
[16:05] try it and you go through negotiating
[16:07] trying to get this person to taste
[16:08] something that you've experienced that's
[16:12] good but they're not sure
[16:14] if they want to get a bite of that
[16:17] you know it's uh
[16:19] you know how many we think about where
[16:22] we've been this weekend
[16:24] how many of those of us that have been
[16:26] here can say that we've had a taste of
[16:29] him
[16:31] have you tasted him this weekend has he
[16:34] been good
[16:37] you know maybe you were
[16:39] one of those
[16:41] who stared at it for a long time
[16:44] yeah
[16:45] I'm not sure I want to give him a try
[16:49] I'm not sure I'm gonna like him
[16:52] I'm not sure he's going to leave a bad
[16:54] taste in my mouth
[16:57] how many of you can say now that you've
[16:58] tasted
[17:00] and you see that he's good and if you
[17:01] haven't tasted of him yet
[17:03] there's one more service
[17:06] taste and see that the Lord is good
[17:10] you know Peter says in First Peter 2
[17:13] he says as newborn babes
[17:16] desire
[17:18] the sincere milk of the word
[17:21] that ye may grow thereby
[17:24] if so be ye have tasted
[17:28] that the Lord is gracious
[17:30] have you ever
[17:32] seen a hungry baby
[17:35] you know once they ever get a taste of
[17:37] that milk
[17:38] they cry for it
[17:40] they desire it you'll see them
[17:42] practically cave in the sides of a
[17:44] bottle
[17:45] the moment that they get it put in their
[17:47] hand
[17:48] once you get a real taste of him
[17:51] you just can't get enough you just want
[17:54] to continue to taste and taste and taste
[17:57] and you want more and more
[18:01] you remember the children of Israel
[18:03] when they first left the land of Egypt
[18:07] you know when they first began their
[18:09] journey in the wilderness
[18:12] you know they still had an appetite
[18:15] a taste
[18:16] for the food of Egypt
[18:20] you know and every time they get hungry
[18:22] they'd say boy I I could really use some
[18:25] of that
[18:27] but you know then God gave them a taste
[18:29] of something that came from heaven
[18:32] something that tasted sweet
[18:36] and by the time they got to the promised
[18:38] land nobody was asking for the food of
[18:40] Egypt anymore
[18:42] you know see there had been new births
[18:44] that had happened with this food
[18:48] they had developed an appetite feasting
[18:51] on this heavenly bread
[18:55] you know when we read Psalm 34
[18:58] what this really is
[19:00] it's a testimony
[19:03] it's a proclamation a declaration of
[19:06] somebody
[19:08] who has tasted yes and seen that the
[19:11] Lord is good and now he's telling about
[19:13] it
[19:16] you know you see you can't encourage
[19:18] somebody to try something
[19:21] if you haven't first tasted of it of
[19:25] yourself
[19:28] if you've tasted him and found him good
[19:33] now you need to offer someone else a
[19:35] taste
[19:38] look at some of these statements that
[19:40] we're going to read here in psalm 34.
[19:43] it says in verse 1 I will bless the Lord
[19:46] at all times
[19:49] his praise shall continually
[19:53] be in my mouth
[19:54] constantly
[19:57] continuously
[19:59] you know the mouth is the source of
[20:01] tasting
[20:04] what's in the mouth
[20:07] is a constant source of praise
[20:13] you know and praise isn't necessarily
[20:15] singing and worshiping in a church
[20:16] service
[20:21] you know David said in
[20:23] Psalm 119 103 how sweet are thy words
[20:28] unto my taste
[20:30] yay sweeter than honey to my mouth
[20:35] you know someone who has developed a
[20:37] taste for him
[20:38] constantly has his word on their lips
[20:43] that's how you praise him
[20:46] that's how you bless him
[20:49] that's how you glorify him
[20:51] by taking his word and constantly
[20:54] putting it on your lips
[20:57] that your his word is constantly in your
[21:00] mouth
[21:03] just like a hungry baby
[21:06] you know the testimony of one who has
[21:09] tasted him is someone who's constantly
[21:12] eating and speaking that word
[21:18] verse two my soul
[21:20] shall make her boast in the Lord
[21:24] The Humble shall hear thereof
[21:27] and be glad
[21:30] how many of you have ever heard someone
[21:32] boast
[21:34] in silence
[21:37] requires speaking
[21:41] it requires if you've ever been around
[21:44] someone that's boastful
[21:47] you know they're constantly talking
[21:49] about
[21:51] their abilities
[21:53] or the works that they've done or can do
[21:56] to the point where you can hardly stand
[21:58] to be around that individual because
[22:00] it's the only thing that ever comes out
[22:02] of their mouth
[22:04] my soul
[22:06] shall make her boast
[22:09] in the Lord
[22:10] you know someone who has tasted him
[22:13] is constantly boasting
[22:16] of his works
[22:20] Jeremiah 9 24 but let him the glorieth
[22:24] glory in this
[22:26] that he understandeth and knoweth me
[22:31] that I am the Lord which you exercise
[22:33] loving kindness
[22:35] judgment and righteousness in the Earth
[22:39] for in these things I Delight saith the
[22:43] Lord
[22:45] can you say that you've tasted of the
[22:48] Lord this weekend and found him good
[22:53] well then you should be offering someone
[22:57] else a taste
[23:01] you know David says if you we were going
[23:03] to read through the rest of Psalm 34
[23:06] everybody is going to hear about him
[23:10] from me
[23:13] he invites those around him verse 3 to
[23:16] participate o magnify the Lord with me
[23:19] with me
[23:21] and let us exalt his name together
[23:25] join me
[23:27] let's Magnify Him together
[23:32] what does he speak of great spiritual
[23:34] Mysteries
[23:35] great deep things of the scriptures no
[23:39] he speaks of what the Lord did for him
[23:42] the taste that he had
[23:46] brother Branham said it this way telling
[23:48] them how your candle got lit
[23:53] David says it this way I sought the Lord
[23:56] and he heard me and delivered me
[24:00] from all my fears
[24:02] how many of you have been delivered from
[24:04] Fear this weekend
[24:06] amen thank you you got something to talk
[24:09] about
[24:11] you know Jesus said it this way you are
[24:13] the salt of the earth
[24:16] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[24:19] hid
[24:20] if you've tasted of him and found him
[24:22] good
[24:23] you should be offering someone else
[24:26] that's right a taste
[24:28] you see he didn't call us
[24:30] to have church
[24:33] sure we have church
[24:35] we worship that's where we come to hear
[24:38] from him but he's called us to be a
[24:41] church
[24:42] not just to gather in church services
[24:44] but to go put his word on our lips
[24:47] to boast of his Works to offer someone a
[24:50] taste of what we've tasted here
[24:53] let's go ahead and stand this morning as
[24:55] we read Psalm 34 together
[24:59] this is the testimony of someone who has
[25:02] tasted and seen
[25:05] that the Lord is good we'll read this
[25:07] together starting in verse one I Will
[25:10] Bless The Lord at all times his praise
[25:13] shall continually be in my mouth my soul
[25:16] shall make her boast in the Lord The
[25:18] Humble shall hear thereof and be glad o
[25:21] magnify the Lord with me and let us
[25:24] exalt his name together I sought the
[25:27] Lord and he heard me and delivered me
[25:29] from all my fears they looked unto him
[25:32] and were lightened and their faces were
[25:35] not ashamed this poor man cried and the
[25:38] Lord heard him and saved him out of all
[25:40] his troubles the angel of the Lord in
[25:43] campeth round about them that fear Him
[25:45] and delivereth them o taste and see that
[25:49] the Lord is good blessed is the man that
[25:52] trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his
[25:55] Saints for there is no want to them that
[25:57] fear Him the Young Lions do lack and
[26:00] suffer hunger but they that seek the
[26:03] Lord shall not want any good thing Come
[26:06] Ye children hearken unto me I will teach
[26:09] you the fear of the Lord what man is he
[26:11] that desireth life and loveth many days
[26:14] that he may see good keep thy tongue
[26:17] from evil and thy lips from speaking
[26:19] guile depart from Evil and do good seek
[26:23] peace and pursue it the eyes of the Lord
[26:25] are upon the righteous and his ears are
[26:28] open unto their cry the face of the Lord
[26:31] is against them that do evil to cut off
[26:33] the remembrance of them from the earth
[26:35] the righteous cry and the Lord heareth
[26:38] and delivereth them out of all their
[26:40] troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that
[26:43] are of a broken heart and saveth such as
[26:46] be of a contrite spirit many are the
[26:49] afflictions of the righteous but the
[26:51] Lord delivereth him out of them all he
[26:53] keepeth all his bones not one of them is
[26:56] broken evil shall slay the wicked and
[26:59] they that hate the righteous shall be
[27:00] desolate the Lord redeemeth the soul of
[27:03] his servants and none of them that trust
[27:06] in him shall be desolate amen
[27:10] amen praise the Lord you may have your
[27:13] seats amen man I trust you're happy to
[27:17] be in the house of God this morning amen

[1:20:04] you know preachers can have a meeting
[1:20:07] because they all do the talking
[1:20:10] you know they don't they they listen
[1:20:13] only to respond
[1:20:15] and so it comes to Great Heights but
[1:20:18] when you have people that are feasting
[1:20:20] on God's word that's great that God can
[1:20:24] give you something that you can take
[1:20:26] personally and and that's wonderful so
[1:20:29] we certainly uh thank you for all coming
[1:20:33] and then I I like your prayers we'll be
[1:20:35] in Phoenix Arizona this coming weekend
[1:20:38] to do some Banquets and and have service
[1:20:42] there in in Phoenix with brother Ron so
[1:20:45] please keep us in prayer but you know I
[1:20:48] wanted to leave a little something with
[1:20:51] uh
[1:20:52] young people today and
[1:20:55] and uh and if you have your Bibles and
[1:20:58] you would turn over to the Psalm 119 and
[1:21:03] the ninth verse and before we read this
[1:21:06] I'd like to say that the baptismal pools
[1:21:08] open
[1:21:10] for anybody who wants to be baptized and
[1:21:14] if you'd like us to lay hands on you
[1:21:17] that if you want to receive the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost and you'd like us to lay hands on
[1:21:22] you that you might receive the Holy
[1:21:24] Ghost we'd be happy to do that
[1:21:27] after service today is you just want to
[1:21:30] come and say you know I'd like to have
[1:21:32] you lay hands on me that I would receive
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost
[1:21:36] certainly God will do that
[1:21:40] but there's a great question asking or
[1:21:42] maybe Mike you could put that Psalms 119
[1:21:45] verse 9.
[1:21:47] you say brother McGarry we want to get
[1:21:50] to the word well we have a formula here
[1:21:52] that the preacher has to preach longer
[1:21:55] than the song service
[1:21:57] so we're we're certainly wanting to add
[1:22:00] up his minutes here
[1:22:04] but listen to this great question
[1:22:08] wherewithal
[1:22:10] shall a young man cleanse his ways and
[1:22:16] that goes for young women
[1:22:19] wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
[1:22:21] his ways now listen to the answer in the
[1:22:25] next few verses
[1:22:27] by taking heed
[1:22:29] there too according to Thy Word
[1:22:33] with my whole heart have I sought thee o
[1:22:37] let me not Wander from thy Commandments
[1:22:42] Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:22:46] that I might not sin against thee
[1:22:50] blessed art out O Lord teach me thy
[1:22:54] statutes
[1:22:55] with my lips have I declared all thy
[1:22:59] judgments of thy mouth
[1:23:02] I have rejoiced in the way of thy
[1:23:06] testimonies as much as in all riches I
[1:23:10] have meditated in the precepts and have
[1:23:15] respect unto thy ways I will Delight
[1:23:19] myself in thy statutes I will not forget
[1:23:24] Thy word
[1:23:26] if I could leave that with each of you
[1:23:28] young people as you would go in the
[1:23:31] meeting comes to an end
[1:23:33] that's a great secret if you'd take that
[1:23:35] out every now and then and read it
[1:23:38] make that a commitment in your heart
[1:23:42] Lord I will not leave your ways I'll
[1:23:45] meditate on them I'll declare your
[1:23:48] riches and your testimonies and I know
[1:23:51] if you do those things you'll be
[1:23:53] successful
[1:23:54] our heart's desire is that when you
[1:23:57] leave these meetings that you've
[1:23:59] received something that you can take
[1:24:01] with you
[1:24:03] not more but something that will become
[1:24:05] a rock and a something in your life that
[1:24:10] will ever continue to grow and guide you
[1:24:14] down life's path
[1:24:16] and so that's our great heart's desire
[1:24:18] for you that when we leave here we leave
[1:24:22] with something that has now become our
[1:24:24] possession
[1:24:25] the fellowship's been wonderful and the
[1:24:28] preaching has been outstanding we
[1:24:31] certainly appreciate it brother Danny
[1:24:35] but the most important thing is for you
[1:24:37] to leave with something
[1:24:39] a momentum something in your heart
[1:24:42] that you know you've been touched by God
[1:24:44] so I just want you to know that's my
[1:24:47] heart's desire for each of you life's
[1:24:50] Journeys long I never thought that I
[1:24:53] would be here I was converted pre 77.
[1:24:57] and
[1:24:59] in one way I'm glad he's hadn't come
[1:25:03] because I'd have never known all the
[1:25:06] riches of his mercy and His glory the
[1:25:09] power of His might and how little I knew
[1:25:12] and how great he's unfolding himself and
[1:25:16] and I believe there's so much more for
[1:25:18] us don't you amen so as we turn the
[1:25:21] service to the word let us Stand
[1:25:23] Together
[1:25:25] I'd like to sing that song the great
[1:25:27] emancipator

[1:25:32] emancipated means to be set free
[1:25:36] to be free from obligations or burdens
[1:25:41] you know when I looked up the great
[1:25:42] emancipator and what came up as Abraham
[1:25:45] Lincoln

[1:30:29] we're all alone and and you're the first
[1:30:31] one to ever face what you face but he's
[1:30:33] lying to you and so we trust that the

[1:31:07] God we ask you Lord that you would move
[1:31:09] in a special way through your word to
[1:31:12] every need that is here Lord I pray that
[1:31:15] you would anoint my lips anoint the ears
[1:31:17] of the ear and we'll ask these things
[1:31:19] that For Your Glory and your honor in
[1:31:21] Jesus name amen
[1:31:24] amen I'd ask you to turn in your bibles
[1:31:27] if you will to the book of Nehemiah
[1:31:32] and
[1:31:40] and we're turned to
[1:31:43] the second chapter
[1:31:45] in Nehemiah
[1:31:49] I want to read something
[1:31:51] brother Brandon said in a message he
[1:31:55] preached called The Church of the Living
[1:31:57] God
[1:31:58] and he's speaking
[1:32:01] he's looking to a man
[1:32:04] in the back and he's telling the people
[1:32:07] to have faith and he calls a man out he
[1:32:09] says you're looking at me strangely
[1:32:12] you with a tie on and you've been
[1:32:14] praying
[1:32:15] and I see you kneel in a room and you
[1:32:17] prayed
[1:32:18] that if you could ever get near him that
[1:32:20] you would be healed
[1:32:22] he said you suffer with a kidney trouble
[1:32:24] isn't that true
[1:32:26] he said Jesus Christ makes you whole my
[1:32:29] brother stand to your feet he said now
[1:32:32] there goes that spirit
[1:32:34] to Blackness leaving that man
[1:32:37] you can watch it it's got a sympathizing
[1:32:40] partner
[1:32:42] and there it falls over a man
[1:32:45] sitting there with a t-shirt on a
[1:32:47] black-headed man his hands in his face
[1:32:49] is it's what it says his hands in his
[1:32:51] face stand up young man you suffer with
[1:32:54] kidney stones except your Jesus Christ
[1:32:57] as your healing and I I just I read that
[1:32:59] to uh emphasize the part that he says
[1:33:04] you have
[1:33:05] a sympathizing it has a sympathizing
[1:33:08] partner
[1:33:10] and I want to preach a message this
[1:33:12] morning it's going to be a strange title
[1:33:14] and if you don't remember anything maybe
[1:33:15] you remember that
[1:33:17] and that is two brothers
[1:33:19] you don't want in your church
[1:33:29] and you can add that if you want
[1:33:32] just to
[1:33:34] now Brothers we're not wrestling with
[1:33:36] flesh and blood all right
[1:33:39] well you ignore that amen
[1:33:44] all right let's look at the fifth verse
[1:33:46] thank you brother David for that
[1:33:50] the fifth verse chapter 2 we're going to
[1:33:53] read to the end of the chapter and I
[1:33:55] said to the king
[1:34:00] if it pleased the king and If thy
[1:34:02] servant have found favor in thy sight
[1:34:05] that you would send me unto Judah unto
[1:34:07] the city of my father's sepulchers that
[1:34:11] I may build it
[1:34:13] and the King said unto me the queen also
[1:34:15] sitting by him
[1:34:16] or how long shall I journey be and when
[1:34:18] will you return so it pleased the king
[1:34:21] to send me and I set him a time
[1:34:24] moreover I said unto the king if it
[1:34:26] pleased the king
[1:34:28] let letters be given me to the governors
[1:34:31] beyond the river that they may convey me
[1:34:33] over till I come into Judah
[1:34:37] in a letter under ASAP The Keeper of the
[1:34:39] king's Forest that he may give me Timber
[1:34:42] to make beams for the gates of the
[1:34:44] palace
[1:34:45] which appertain to the house and for the
[1:34:47] wall of the city and for the house that
[1:34:49] I shall enter into and the King granted
[1:34:52] me according to the good hand of of my
[1:34:56] God upon me
[1:34:57] and I came to the governor's beyond the
[1:34:59] river and gave them the king's letters
[1:35:01] now the king had sent captains of the
[1:35:03] army and Horsemen with me and when some
[1:35:05] ballot the horror night and tobiah the
[1:35:08] servant the ammonite heard of it it
[1:35:09] grieved them exceedingly that there was
[1:35:12] come a man to seek the welfare
[1:35:15] of the children of Israel
[1:35:17] so I came to Jerusalem and I was there
[1:35:19] three days and I arose in the night
[1:35:22] I had some men with me and neither told
[1:35:24] I any man what my God had put in my
[1:35:27] heart to do at Jerusalem neither was
[1:35:30] there any Beast with me save the Beast I
[1:35:32] rode upon and I went out by Night by the
[1:35:35] gate of the valley even before the
[1:35:37] dragon well into the dung port and I
[1:35:39] viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were
[1:35:41] broken down and the gates thereof were
[1:35:44] consumed with fire
[1:35:46] then I went on to the gate of the
[1:35:48] fountain into the king's pool but there
[1:35:50] was no place for the Beast that was
[1:35:51] under me to pass and I went up by Night
[1:35:53] by the Brook and I viewed the wall and
[1:35:56] turned back and I entered by the gate of
[1:35:58] the valley and I returned
[1:36:00] and the rulers knew not whether I went
[1:36:02] or what I did neither had I told the
[1:36:05] Jews yet nor to the priests nor the
[1:36:07] Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest
[1:36:09] that did the work
[1:36:11] then said I unto them you see the
[1:36:13] distress we're in
[1:36:15] how Jerusalem life waste and the gates
[1:36:18] thereof are burned with fire come let us
[1:36:21] build up the wall of Jerusalem that we
[1:36:24] be no more reproach
[1:36:26] then I told them of the hand of my God
[1:36:28] which was good upon me and also the
[1:36:30] words of the king that he'd spoken unto
[1:36:32] me and they said let us rise up and
[1:36:35] build so they strengthened their hands
[1:36:37] for this good work
[1:36:39] but when symbolic to horror night and
[1:36:41] tobiah the servant the ammonite and
[1:36:43] guess him the Arabian heard it they
[1:36:46] laughed us to scorn and despise us and
[1:36:48] said what is this thing that you do will
[1:36:51] you rebel against the king
[1:36:53] then answered I them and said unto them
[1:36:55] the god of Heaven he will prosper us
[1:36:58] therefore we as servants will arise and
[1:37:01] build but you have no portion
[1:37:05] nor right
[1:37:07] nor Memorial
[1:37:09] in Jerusalem you can be seated may the
[1:37:13] Lord bless the Eden of his word
[1:37:18] something that
[1:37:20] the word
[1:37:22] we always give you the right things to
[1:37:25] say
[1:37:27] according to the need
[1:37:30] and this era that I'm I'm looking at
[1:37:33] here
[1:37:36] is an era of time
[1:37:39] of the last restoration that is in the
[1:37:42] Old Testament
[1:37:45] the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and
[1:37:48] Esther
[1:37:50] are all describing the same era in
[1:37:52] history and also the prophetical books
[1:37:55] of haggai Zechariah
[1:37:58] in Malachi being the last he was the
[1:38:01] last book of Prophecy and he was in the
[1:38:03] time of Nehemiah the previous prophets
[1:38:07] of the Babylonian captivity were
[1:38:09] Jeremiah
[1:38:11] who he was eventually with the remnant
[1:38:14] in Egypt and then Ezekiel who was with a
[1:38:16] Remnant in one part of Babylon
[1:38:19] and then also Daniel who was in the
[1:38:22] courts of Babylon
[1:38:24] the book of Jeremiah of Nehemiah rather
[1:38:27] is describing the hour
[1:38:30] of Revelation and restoration that God
[1:38:34] was giving to his people
[1:38:36] according to his promise
[1:38:39] that after 70 years of of captivity
[1:38:43] through the the Babylonians and then the
[1:38:45] Persians that they would return
[1:38:49] and they would return back to the city
[1:38:51] of God the city that David had wrote
[1:38:54] about and said glorious things are
[1:38:57] spoken of the whole city of God Amen and
[1:39:01] he said David wrote about the walls and
[1:39:04] Isaiah wrote about the walls let the
[1:39:05] walls be walls of Salvation in the gates
[1:39:08] of Praise amen and let the walls be
[1:39:11] built amen the walls of Salvation so the
[1:39:15] mind of God and this is the hour we're
[1:39:17] living in is the mind of restoration
[1:39:20] amen but the restoration cannot be just
[1:39:23] a quote it has to be a burden
[1:39:26] and that burden has to be transferred it
[1:39:28] cannot just be in one man amen but it
[1:39:31] has to be transferred to the people
[1:39:33] because messages of restoration can be
[1:39:36] preached over and over and over amen but
[1:39:39] amen the people unless they catch the
[1:39:41] burden of restoration amen they will
[1:39:44] just sit there and try to absorb and
[1:39:46] you'll go back out into Dallas and
[1:39:48] you'll go back out unto your places and
[1:39:50] you'll go right back to the same thing
[1:39:52] and be satisfied with the with what's
[1:39:55] around you but I want you to know the
[1:39:58] coming of Nehemiah is a declaration of
[1:40:01] war upon the status quo
[1:40:06] that God is not satisfied amen for you
[1:40:10] to live in a certain place and act a
[1:40:13] certain way but there must be
[1:40:15] restoration according to the word that
[1:40:18] he has given
[1:40:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:23] now the word can get a little
[1:40:25] uncomfortable
[1:40:27] all right now I would encourage you when
[1:40:29] the word gets uncomfortable that when it
[1:40:31] when it but it's if it's speaking of a
[1:40:33] situation of yours just squeak out an
[1:40:35] amen let's oil that place that hinge
[1:40:38] that that doesn't like that area you
[1:40:41] know because I found out with people
[1:40:43] when they're they're they're amen and
[1:40:45] they're they're they're screaming real
[1:40:47] loud A lot of times they're doing it
[1:40:48] over someone else's condition
[1:40:54] who am I
[1:40:56] amen but but they when it comes to them
[1:41:02] so we're speaking about two brothers
[1:41:06] don't look around and don't listen to
[1:41:08] Brother David
[1:41:09] Hallelujah
[1:41:14] Jesus when he was on the road dumaeus
[1:41:16] and he's speaking to these men and they
[1:41:18] don't know who he is
[1:41:19] the Bible says he began at Moses because
[1:41:22] he told him he said oh fools and slow of
[1:41:24] Hearts you believe all that the prophets
[1:41:26] have spoken and he began at Moses and
[1:41:29] the prophets had began to expound amen
[1:41:31] and what he was doing is he was
[1:41:33] revealing himself through the whole
[1:41:35] scripture and showing this was me this
[1:41:39] was what was happening was revealing me
[1:41:41] this is what they said would happen and
[1:41:43] this was me being revealed now this is
[1:41:46] the same in Nehemiah this is Christ
[1:41:49] this is his burden this is not about
[1:41:51] Nehemiah this is his burden and and when
[1:41:55] when a man comes and he comes to a
[1:41:58] condition that is there and he's heard
[1:42:01] about it because he'd asked questions he
[1:42:04] said how is the state of Jerusalem they
[1:42:06] said well you know it's it's there's a
[1:42:08] lot of there's a rubble the walls are
[1:42:10] broken down the Gates cannot be used the
[1:42:13] building of the temple has started amen
[1:42:15] but the walls and and the glory of
[1:42:17] Jerusalem there's so much waste and
[1:42:19] things that need to be done and the
[1:42:21] people are living there and they're
[1:42:22] satisfied in that condition and he said
[1:42:25] his heart was grieved and he becomes sad
[1:42:27] because amen that was the condition of
[1:42:30] the city of God Amen and and so he comes
[1:42:34] into the presence of the King of Persia
[1:42:36] and he's sad he's the king's cup Bearer
[1:42:38] now if you read what it was like in in
[1:42:41] in the king's court you could not be sad
[1:42:44] in the king's presence if you were sat
[1:42:47] in his presence it was at the threat of
[1:42:49] death
[1:42:49] amen so he was taking a great risk to to
[1:42:52] show his countenance to the king but the
[1:42:55] countenance amen provoked a response why
[1:42:58] why are you sad in my presence and he
[1:43:00] said how can I not be sad when when the
[1:43:03] city of the holy city is is in this
[1:43:06] condition and and this these things need
[1:43:09] to be done and and the King amen entered
[1:43:11] into that burden because you know he can
[1:43:14] do nothing without the permission of the
[1:43:16] king
[1:43:16] so he requests amen the king says okay
[1:43:19] what time is this going to happen and
[1:43:21] how long is it going to take now if you
[1:43:24] read the book of Nehemiah you'll find
[1:43:26] out this was one of the outstanding
[1:43:28] miracles of the of the of the word
[1:43:31] one of the outstanding Miracles it only
[1:43:34] took 52 weeks to get the work done
[1:43:38] but it laid there far longer
[1:43:41] in a condition
[1:43:43] that was unrepaired not dealt with
[1:43:46] content to live by
[1:43:51] and they let it sit there but when God
[1:43:53] began to work
[1:43:55] in the burden of his word it was a quick
[1:43:58] work
[1:43:59] that brought a restoration
[1:44:03] and I believe God is interested in
[1:44:05] restoration
[1:44:07] he's interested in healing
[1:44:10] he's interested in Deliverance
[1:44:12] But ultimately he's interested in his
[1:44:15] word being fulfilled
[1:44:17] and he is fulfilling his word
[1:44:20] by bringing to himself those that he has
[1:44:23] brought to this age and in those people
[1:44:26] amen is the interpretation of what God
[1:44:30] is doing in this hour every life listen
[1:44:32] you just go ahead and bear with me just
[1:44:34] like my church does at home they bear
[1:44:36] with me amen we got to get Beyond amen
[1:44:39] churches it's about people
[1:44:43] it's about the body of Christ it's not
[1:44:45] about this church is better than that
[1:44:47] church and this church over here has
[1:44:48] this talent and you know every church is
[1:44:50] different
[1:44:51] amen I thank God for what he's given
[1:44:54] given me in in our work back there and I
[1:44:57] know you thank God for for what God has
[1:44:59] given you here but you know if we start
[1:45:01] looking around we'll be nothing we'll
[1:45:03] just be like the book of Corinthians
[1:45:05] amen where they have their favorite
[1:45:07] preachers and who do you say you're of
[1:45:10] well I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos and
[1:45:12] I'm of this one and he said but are we
[1:45:15] not all amen called by the same God he
[1:45:18] said I I planted Apollos water but it's
[1:45:21] God they giveth the increase so this
[1:45:24] work God is doing is not man's work it
[1:45:26] is God's work
[1:45:28] Hallelujah and and you need to get
[1:45:31] beyond the comparisons
[1:45:33] because this is not about churches this
[1:45:35] is not amen this is not Treasures in
[1:45:38] Earthen churches it's treasures and
[1:45:40] Earth and vessels
[1:45:42] if you ain't going to say man you're
[1:45:45] going to sit and look at me then I'm
[1:45:46] going to preach that longer you know one
[1:45:48] way to get a preacher to move on and say
[1:45:50] amen I believe that
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:53] you God wants to do something in your
[1:45:56] life
[1:45:57] you don't want you to assimilate into a
[1:45:59] church and be nothing he doesn't give
[1:46:01] you the Holy Ghost to raise your hand
[1:46:03] and say I got it he gives you the Holy
[1:46:05] Ghost to put you into service
[1:46:08] and that service doesn't have to be very
[1:46:10] long it could be for one purpose you
[1:46:13] understand the Great Men of the word
[1:46:15] John the Baptist six months on the Earth
[1:46:19] with a Ministry six months of Ministry
[1:46:21] Jesus Christ the greatest man that ever
[1:46:25] struck the face of the Earth amen God
[1:46:27] never even talked about all of his
[1:46:29] silent years he never even wrote down
[1:46:31] how great a carpenter he was
[1:46:34] amen his work began in his ministry
[1:46:38] God has something for you to do in the
[1:46:40] Holy Ghost
[1:46:41] it's a service it might be a testimony
[1:46:43] out on the street somewhere it might be
[1:46:46] a testimony in your home
[1:46:48] but you can't do it until you get rid of
[1:46:49] those two men
[1:46:52] we'll talk about them
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:57] so Nehemiah was asked how long is it
[1:47:00] going to take and Nehemiah said he gave
[1:47:02] it time I'm going to go at this certain
[1:47:04] time and the King says I'll give you
[1:47:06] this time
[1:47:07] and he wrote letters
[1:47:10] and they sealed the letters with his
[1:47:12] seal now
[1:47:14] God has a set time of restoration
[1:47:18] Satan is as a type
[1:47:20] of hindering spirit that he wants you to
[1:47:22] wait
[1:47:24] I always wants you to wait here delay
[1:47:25] you
[1:47:26] and the reason he delays you is because
[1:47:28] he knows in the delay
[1:47:30] you lose your zeal
[1:47:34] so you'll see with the story of Nehemiah
[1:47:36] that Satan uses opposition to place
[1:47:39] discouraging thoughts
[1:47:42] and news in the minds of Nehemiah and
[1:47:45] the people but I want you to notice
[1:47:47] nehemiah's position and his attitude
[1:47:49] toward them and may this become your
[1:47:51] position he tells him you have no
[1:47:53] portion
[1:47:55] you have
[1:47:56] that means you have no real estate here
[1:47:59] you have no portion of Jerusalem this
[1:48:01] means you have no real estate here
[1:48:03] it's not your property
[1:48:06] in other words you're a squatter
[1:48:08] it's not your property
[1:48:10] says you have no right legally
[1:48:14] they have no place to stand
[1:48:17] so they may be squatters with takeover
[1:48:19] intentions and whatever they join now
[1:48:22] whatever they enjoy now it is illegal
[1:48:27] they have no Memorial
[1:48:30] which means they have no power of
[1:48:32] testimony
[1:48:33] they have no pedigree
[1:48:36] that connects them to this place
[1:48:39] and Nehemiah lets them know that your
[1:48:43] Authority is only perceived
[1:48:45] it's not real
[1:48:49] he's talking to some ballot and tobiah
[1:48:52] and he's telling them your your
[1:48:53] Authority is is only perceived
[1:48:57] and it's only perceived that way is
[1:48:59] because these people have let you
[1:49:03] be that way
[1:49:06] it's not real he lets them know that he
[1:49:10] understands and discerns their motives
[1:49:12] and I and he says I'll withstand you
[1:49:16] so our attitude must be one of
[1:49:20] understanding the need and also the
[1:49:22] Warfare of the enemy you know many times
[1:49:24] people will come for prayer and they're
[1:49:26] they're talking about the wars in their
[1:49:28] minds and their talk about these things
[1:49:30] but you must understand those Wars of
[1:49:33] the Mind are normal procedure in the
[1:49:36] life of a Christian
[1:49:39] every one of these ministers have wars
[1:49:41] in the mind this was the the agreed
[1:49:44] meeting place between God and Satan
[1:49:46] where God would put his thoughts and
[1:49:49] Satan would put his and you would decide
[1:49:52] which one are you going to believe amen
[1:49:54] but I'll tell you as a Believer I mean
[1:49:56] you let the thoughts of God penetrate
[1:49:58] and drop from your mind into your heart
[1:50:00] amen and when it leaves your mind and
[1:50:02] comes into your heart it's a strength
[1:50:04] against what the enemy is trying to tell
[1:50:06] you
[1:50:07] the enemy's going to tell you you didn't
[1:50:08] receive anything he's going to tell you
[1:50:10] amen what you can't base it upon this or
[1:50:12] you can't base it upon that but I want
[1:50:14] to tell you I want you to base it upon
[1:50:15] what the prophet said you know he said
[1:50:18] that Satan can impersonate any gift
[1:50:20] he can impersonate any gift but what he
[1:50:23] cannot be is the Holy Ghost I want to
[1:50:26] say it again he can impersonate any gift
[1:50:28] but he cannot be the Holy Ghost
[1:50:33] he said I feel it in your mind the
[1:50:34] message desperations I feel it in your
[1:50:36] mind you say how will I know he said no
[1:50:39] certain evidence he said but what were
[1:50:41] you and what are you what did the word
[1:50:45] do to you
[1:50:48] that's right amen
[1:50:50] now
[1:50:52] Nehemiah can ask the same questions
[1:50:55] now you have returned
[1:50:57] you have left uh amen you've left the
[1:51:01] captive country and you return back into
[1:51:04] your Homeland
[1:51:05] why is there Rubble around your home
[1:51:09] why is it when I come through with my my
[1:51:12] Beast I can I can hardly find places to
[1:51:15] move
[1:51:16] why are these things left unattended to
[1:51:20] now nobody knew his burden
[1:51:23] but he had come to seek the welfare
[1:51:26] of his people
[1:51:28] and this is this is the motive of every
[1:51:30] meeting this is why we're here this
[1:51:32] weekend this is why God has a pastor
[1:51:34] here a church here this is why God moves
[1:51:37] it's why he sent a prophet it's why he's
[1:51:39] done it in every age it's why the Holy
[1:51:40] Spirit Comes This is why he's in his
[1:51:42] church amen is because he is seeking the
[1:51:45] welfare of his children
[1:51:48] Hallelujah
[1:51:50] amen and so now
[1:51:53] brother Branham said that if not I know
[1:51:55] that he said that we preach longer
[1:51:58] preach longer than the singing
[1:52:00] twice as long Lord I don't want to do
[1:52:04] that
[1:52:05] amen but I'll start my watch now
[1:52:08] amen oh he certainly enjoyed all the
[1:52:10] singing you know I'm glad they can sing
[1:52:12] as well as me
[1:52:14] Amen brother Jeremy can really sing can
[1:52:16] he you know he was back there brother
[1:52:18] Dave is back there I don't know if I'm
[1:52:19] supposed to say this I'm gonna say it
[1:52:20] anyhow he's back there dancing he's
[1:52:22] singing amen he's a good dancer but I
[1:52:25] started my singing career the same time
[1:52:27] he did I want you to know him amen where
[1:52:30] were you when the sons of God shouted
[1:52:31] for joy in the morning start sang
[1:52:33] together may not sing as good here but I
[1:52:36] sing good there amen
[1:52:37] amen so now you feel a little loose all
[1:52:40] right brother Branham said that if Satan
[1:52:42] can make you think amen that your weapon
[1:52:45] is on the same level as as Satan's and
[1:52:49] your weapon is what it is the words amen
[1:52:52] and if he can make you think now now
[1:52:54] maybe this will offends somebody I don't
[1:52:56] know but I want you to know what I'm
[1:52:58] holding in my hand is Malachi 4 brother
[1:53:01] Branham it is his absolute
[1:53:05] the Bible is brother branham's absolute
[1:53:08] I mean I know we want to be Mormons and
[1:53:10] make another Bible but this is the Bible
[1:53:13] the message is the revealed words
[1:53:16] it was not revealing any other book it
[1:53:19] was revealing this book
[1:53:21] it's not good enough for me to have a
[1:53:23] birth certificate in a hospital but if I
[1:53:25] can find myself in here the Gates of
[1:53:28] Hell will never Prevail against it
[1:53:30] and I want you to know I can identify
[1:53:32] myself in the word
[1:53:35] amen so now Satan can make you think at
[1:53:38] this word
[1:53:40] is
[1:53:41] just as strong maybe not even as strong
[1:53:44] as your nerves
[1:53:48] as your conceptions
[1:53:50] as your walk
[1:53:54] oh
[1:53:56] it's not as strong as your marriage
[1:53:58] problems
[1:54:02] you won't use it
[1:54:05] and as soon as you lay it down
[1:54:07] you have lost
[1:54:11] this is how you're going to defeat him
[1:54:17] but he's here in the spirit of
[1:54:19] restoration
[1:54:21] as long as you settle for the defeat of
[1:54:26] a discouraged mind and you settle
[1:54:30] for that depression and not let the
[1:54:32] power of the word go to Every child
[1:54:35] listen I don't say you don't deal with
[1:54:36] those things I don't say you don't
[1:54:38] suffer ministers go through those things
[1:54:41] and and and you go through them but you
[1:54:43] don't go through them defeat it
[1:54:45] because when you come into these things
[1:54:47] you should search the word begin to pull
[1:54:50] from the word amen the Brother David
[1:54:52] read the scripture how shall a young man
[1:54:54] cleanse his way well this is how this is
[1:54:57] how your marriages are are built back
[1:54:59] this is how amen your sons and daughters
[1:55:02] come back this is how you heal
[1:55:05] through his words he said I sent my word
[1:55:08] and I healed their disease I know people
[1:55:12] say when we say the word you're thinking
[1:55:14] of the letter and all he says the words
[1:55:16] I speak unto you they are spirit and
[1:55:18] they are life amen and we're here amen
[1:55:21] you you cannot rest amen you cannot
[1:55:24] judge anything by your emotion you must
[1:55:27] judge it by the words
[1:55:28] because your emotion will tell you
[1:55:30] you're saved and your emotion will tell
[1:55:32] you you're lost amen but the word will
[1:55:34] not change its mind amen the word said I
[1:55:37] knew you and then therefore I redeemed
[1:55:40] you I mean it'll give you a place to
[1:55:42] stand hey I'm like anybody else I love
[1:55:44] emotion but emotion will blind me
[1:55:46] emotion will lie to me right right
[1:55:50] yes yes it will my emotions lying to me
[1:55:52] right now says I'm tired
[1:55:54] amen
[1:55:56] as long as you settle for that defeat
[1:55:59] and not let the power of the word go to
[1:56:02] every channel
[1:56:07] clean it out
[1:56:09] Satan has defeated you
[1:56:11] he's defeated your purpose
[1:56:13] he's defeated your zeal
[1:56:16] you've LED
[1:56:17] you've laid your weapon down
[1:56:20] now I read that scripture in Nehemiah
[1:56:22] the 12th verse I Rose in the night and
[1:56:24] men were some men with me a few men none
[1:56:26] of them knew what I was doing
[1:56:28] I said but I went out there knew a man
[1:56:30] knew what God had put in my heart
[1:56:33] but neither was there any Beast with me
[1:56:35] say the one I wrote on and I went out by
[1:56:37] night I want you to know this man is
[1:56:39] riding through a ruined destroyed City
[1:56:44] and he's looking at all the mess
[1:56:47] but he's not there to advertise the mess
[1:56:51] he's there to investigate what he's
[1:56:54] going to restore so he'll go through the
[1:56:57] life and you'll go thoroughly because
[1:56:59] before there can be restoration you must
[1:57:02] see what has been ruined
[1:57:05] come on Church you must see what has
[1:57:07] been ruined the devil would like you to
[1:57:10] stay in confusion and just see piles of
[1:57:12] rubbish let me tell you we're all we're
[1:57:15] all in a carnal body and if we just
[1:57:16] start looking for Flaws you're going to
[1:57:18] find them I'll tell you you can look at
[1:57:19] my life you can find flaws you can find
[1:57:21] flaws in anybody here and I can sure
[1:57:23] find flaws on anybody there and if you
[1:57:26] start capitalizing on the flaws of
[1:57:28] somebody else that is not the spirit of
[1:57:30] restoration that's one of those brothers
[1:57:32] that need to be kicked out of the
[1:57:34] congregation
[1:57:35] amen and so now you cannot rebuild what
[1:57:38] you don't know has been destroyed
[1:57:42] many people instead of trying to rebuild
[1:57:45] and restore they ignore
[1:57:49] or you raise your hand and praise your
[1:57:50] hand praise the Lord anyhow but that
[1:57:52] doesn't restore it
[1:57:56] you got to deal with it
[1:58:00] rubbish too much junk
[1:58:05] will cause you to say it's too hard
[1:58:08] too much garbage
[1:58:10] will cause you to say there's no use
[1:58:14] but the burden of restoration rides
[1:58:17] through this rubbish
[1:58:19] and he wants to take inventory
[1:58:22] not to accuse you
[1:58:26] for the accuser of the Brethren's
[1:58:27] already done that
[1:58:29] but he is thorough
[1:58:31] and he is complete
[1:58:34] he does not build on a pile of rubbish
[1:58:44] I said again he will not build on a pile
[1:58:48] of rubbish
[1:58:49] you can leave an area you can try to do
[1:58:52] whatever you want to get away from
[1:58:54] rubbish but if it has not been cleaned
[1:58:56] up and restored that rubbish is still
[1:58:58] there
[1:59:06] but when he's done
[1:59:09] the rubbish is gone
[1:59:12] brother Branham said all the acts of the
[1:59:14] Believers have been in type showing what
[1:59:16] God's great plan is what he what he
[1:59:18] wants to do and what he had in his mind
[1:59:20] from before the foundation of the world
[1:59:23] we would not know these things unless
[1:59:25] God wanted to reveal them
[1:59:27] you will not know what God does not want
[1:59:31] you to know
[1:59:33] but when he reveals something amen he
[1:59:37] wants you to know it
[1:59:39] right and this is the hour he set notice
[1:59:42] the king asked what time how long and I
[1:59:46] set the time
[1:59:48] so there's a set time of restoration of
[1:59:51] his word this is the hour that he wanted
[1:59:53] to reveal himself now the hour is not
[1:59:55] guessed upon the hour is announced and
[1:59:58] when Nehemiah got to Jerusalem he
[2:00:01] announced why he was there we are here
[2:00:04] to build what has been destroyed that
[2:00:07] set the time
[2:00:09] amen not to the world but to them who
[2:00:12] would believe on him through their words
[2:00:15] notice Jesus said that the word would be
[2:00:18] given and in every age and in every
[2:00:20] message God is sending a man to seek the
[2:00:23] welfare of his children amen and even
[2:00:26] more than the agency of man who God uses
[2:00:30] in every generation still using today
[2:00:32] but the person of Jesus Christ is here
[2:00:35] to seek the welfare of his people he
[2:00:38] calls Israel the apple of my eye the
[2:00:42] apple of my eye is the aperture through
[2:00:44] which you see and he's saying Israel is
[2:00:47] my people and is through Israel how the
[2:00:50] people will see God so God with Destin a
[2:00:53] people to be the aperture through which
[2:00:55] amen the world would know who God is
[2:00:59] all right come on Church there's a way
[2:01:02] that God has designed for the World to
[2:01:04] See Jesus Christ and that is through his
[2:01:07] people
[2:01:10] not through how well a person can preach
[2:01:13] not through how many tapes you listen to
[2:01:15] amen but through your life that has been
[2:01:19] redeemed amen do you know what it does
[2:01:22] to someone lost in sin when another man
[2:01:24] can stand up and say I've been delivered
[2:01:27] of the same thing
[2:01:30] oh that sympathizing partner begins to
[2:01:33] tremble because he knows the hour of
[2:01:35] restoration is called
[2:01:38] oh
[2:01:43] I said I wouldn't yell
[2:01:49] Amen Brother David
[2:01:51] healing the power of the river I need it
[2:01:56] amen
[2:01:58] so we want to get the sense you love the
[2:02:00] Lord
[2:02:01] okay that was weak do you love the Lord
[2:02:04] that's better
[2:02:06] so we want to get the better sense
[2:02:09] of what God is doing also realize those
[2:02:12] events are tied to our time
[2:02:14] that restoration is tied to this
[2:02:16] restoration
[2:02:18] the Bible's not called the Bible it's
[2:02:20] called The Holy Bible
[2:02:22] because it's the word of God so even
[2:02:24] though it's a history
[2:02:26] primarily it's the history of of
[2:02:29] election
[2:02:31] amen you find out the Bible brother
[2:02:32] Brown says it's a history
[2:02:34] it's a love story it's a prophecy
[2:02:37] amen it's all of these things amen it's
[2:02:39] his love letter to his bride now thing
[2:02:42] with God is he never Cuts corners
[2:02:45] amen he don't hide from the reader the
[2:02:48] wickedness of his own people
[2:02:50] you know often a history book is
[2:02:52] sympathetic toward its own people in its
[2:02:54] own culture
[2:02:55] and we got it we got all kinds of of
[2:02:58] different countries represented here and
[2:03:00] and you know and and if you are are are
[2:03:02] are you know wanting to tell me about
[2:03:05] your country many times you just tell me
[2:03:06] the good things
[2:03:08] you know I could do the same thing well
[2:03:10] this is a wonderful wonderful country
[2:03:12] it's country of Abraham Lincoln you know
[2:03:14] right and the great emancipator and uh
[2:03:18] it's a country of what George Washington
[2:03:19] and it's a country of freedom and it's a
[2:03:22] country of this in the country of that
[2:03:23] and and then but you know there's a lot
[2:03:25] of Dark Places
[2:03:28] in every country and God doesn't hide it
[2:03:31] and the reason he doesn't hide it is
[2:03:33] he's not gossiping amen but he's telling
[2:03:36] you about these dark places in order for
[2:03:38] you to be able to see the depth and the
[2:03:41] mercy and the grace of God that goes to
[2:03:43] every dark place and when he's done
[2:03:46] there is light there and not Darkness
[2:03:49] ask David about it when he committed
[2:03:51] adultery and and killed a man in order
[2:03:53] to keep his secret and and how it
[2:03:54] brought a civil war into Israel and how
[2:03:56] he lost four of his own Sons God never
[2:03:59] hid it from him and when he was so
[2:04:01] blinded that hood of death is over him
[2:04:03] and the prophet Nathan steps out and
[2:04:05] says listen we have a situation in
[2:04:07] Israel a rich man to has many lambs and
[2:04:10] he and he wanted a feast so he went to a
[2:04:13] poor man who had only one lamb and he
[2:04:15] took that lamb and he and he slaughtered
[2:04:17] it and and he used it for the feast and
[2:04:19] and he said him while Nathan's telling
[2:04:21] that story oh man David's getting mad he
[2:04:24] goes who would dare do that in my
[2:04:26] kingdom and you know many times that's
[2:04:28] the way people hear a message preached
[2:04:30] they're applying it to somebody else in
[2:04:32] the kingdom when God is actually talking
[2:04:34] to you
[2:04:36] he's talking to you don't amen for
[2:04:39] somebody else amen for yourself
[2:04:42] thank you
[2:04:45] amen for somebody else you're only
[2:04:47] adding to the pile of garbage but if you
[2:04:48] aim in for yourself something's starting
[2:04:50] to get clean so be it Lord so be it Lord
[2:04:53] clean me out Lord
[2:04:55] amen your work can do something I cannot
[2:04:58] do I've tried to let go of grudges I
[2:05:00] tried to let go of bitterness I tried to
[2:05:02] let go of talking about Ministry and
[2:05:04] talking about somebody else and I
[2:05:05] haven't been able to stop help me Lord
[2:05:06] it's affected my family it's affected my
[2:05:09] children help me Lord
[2:05:12] you amen for somebody else
[2:05:14] it isn't going to work
[2:05:16] amen David said that man should die as
[2:05:20] soon as he uttered that amen the eyes of
[2:05:23] of Nathan narrowed down and Grace
[2:05:25] stepped in and says you'll not die David
[2:05:27] you're the man
[2:05:32] how long does it take for us to realize
[2:05:35] in a sermon that God is talking to me
[2:05:40] got too much pride
[2:05:44] we ought to think we're more spiritual
[2:05:46] than anybody else
[2:05:48] big eyes are little use
[2:05:51] come on there ain't no generals and
[2:05:53] privates we're all the body of Christ
[2:05:56] [Applause]
[2:05:57] yes Sons and Daughters of God saved by
[2:06:00] the grace of God
[2:06:02] how dare we belittle God
[2:06:06] the youngest person in here he can raise
[2:06:08] up is a mighty testimony
[2:06:11] look through the Bible
[2:06:13] it was many young people that God raised
[2:06:16] up in spite of their family
[2:06:21] young men young women taken out of
[2:06:24] barren conditions taken into captivity
[2:06:26] they still could testify God used it for
[2:06:29] his glory to show he's the same
[2:06:31] yesterday today and forever
[2:06:33] she's interested in restoration
[2:06:37] amen
[2:06:39] say something about restoration it does
[2:06:41] not ignore the facts
[2:06:44] restoration does not bypass the word
[2:06:48] in order to restore
[2:06:51] restoration is not ignoring the word
[2:06:53] rather it is the word
[2:06:56] restoration is not Grace made disgrace
[2:06:59] but restoration used Grace as the means
[2:07:02] to build
[2:07:04] it's the energy of the Holy Ghost that
[2:07:06] God gives to rebuild is Grace
[2:07:09] restoration does not build on a hidden
[2:07:11] condition
[2:07:13] because of it did
[2:07:15] it would weaken the restoration
[2:07:18] but restoration brings the life back to
[2:07:21] the word condition
[2:07:25] that's highlighted in Ezra Nehemiah
[2:07:29] when we see those that had intermingled
[2:07:31] with idolatrous Nations and marriage
[2:07:33] they either rejected those marriages or
[2:07:35] are cast out
[2:07:37] it was a type that you cannot bring
[2:07:38] idols
[2:07:41] cannot bring Idols into your
[2:07:43] relationship with the Lord
[2:07:45] as long as you allow something to exist
[2:07:48] in you that causes a question
[2:07:51] in your walk with the Lord
[2:07:53] you're living in a weakened condition
[2:07:57] your service will remain polluted
[2:08:01] coming into Christ is a walk with God
[2:08:03] where there's no condemnation
[2:08:07] young people I want to encourage you to
[2:08:09] walk with God is there is no therefore
[2:08:11] now no condemnation to them which are in
[2:08:13] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[2:08:16] flesh but after the spirit the spirit is
[2:08:18] saying another thing in the flesh is
[2:08:20] saying
[2:08:22] come on
[2:08:24] amen as if we have seen this restoration
[2:08:27] here Nehemiah Daniel prophesied of it
[2:08:30] and said it would take place in
[2:08:31] Troublesome times
[2:08:33] troubles times this restoration would
[2:08:36] take place not a time of Peace but a
[2:08:37] time of trouble amen times of peril the
[2:08:41] meaning of troubleless times mean it
[2:08:42] would be pushed into a tight place it'd
[2:08:45] be anguish it would be primarily with
[2:08:48] the meaning of pressure and emotional
[2:08:50] and spiritual pressure and he said I'll
[2:08:52] build thy walls and those kinds of time
[2:08:55] here we are in the same kind of time men
[2:08:59] are lovers of their self amen amen
[2:09:01] perilous time Paul calls it they love
[2:09:04] themselves they follow their own
[2:09:05] opinions and not the word men are
[2:09:07] anointed with the spirit of the
[2:09:09] Destroyer upon them and a man without
[2:09:11] the Holy Ghost will be destructive in
[2:09:14] his home and in his church
[2:09:16] it's all kinds of time
[2:09:19] all kinds of time a time when Zeal has
[2:09:22] been pushed out
[2:09:24] and the wrong kind of Zeals on display
[2:09:27] the Zeal to repent leaves in the Zeal
[2:09:30] for pleasure remains
[2:09:33] love is a pleasure more than lovers of
[2:09:35] God
[2:09:37] having a form of godliness
[2:09:39] but denying the power thereof well what
[2:09:42] does that mean it doesn't mean they
[2:09:43] don't know that God is is powerful it
[2:09:46] means they don't they deny the power of
[2:09:49] God to work
[2:09:56] saying you believe something with no
[2:09:58] power to live what you believe
[2:10:01] that's the condition of this age
[2:10:04] I want you to notice this is also the
[2:10:06] condition when God comes to restore the
[2:10:08] captives back to their land
[2:10:10] God is determined to build the temple
[2:10:12] rebuild it he's determined to rebuild
[2:10:13] Jerusalem he was determined to rebuild
[2:10:15] the walls but the cities and ruins
[2:10:18] amen and if there's a condition that
[2:10:20] needs to be restored God's going to send
[2:10:22] somebody with a burden that it'll be
[2:10:24] restored if there's a condition in this
[2:10:26] church that needs restoration God is
[2:10:28] going to bring a message he's going to
[2:10:30] bring somebody across he's going to do
[2:10:32] something to restore your life because
[2:10:33] that's the God I serve
[2:10:36] it's a city in Ruins when Nehemiah comes
[2:10:38] it's nothing but Rubble
[2:10:40] the precious meanings that every gate
[2:10:42] has been for the most part broken down
[2:10:44] and burnt by fire
[2:10:46] if it's broken and not be used
[2:10:49] if something's broken you won't have no
[2:10:51] confidence in it
[2:10:55] you won't use it
[2:10:58] we first get a glimpse of this
[2:10:59] opposition
[2:11:01] when Nehemiah comes
[2:11:04] from the shoeshine the palace with the
[2:11:06] burden of restoration
[2:11:09] now he's already been given the message
[2:11:10] of restoration
[2:11:12] the king's word
[2:11:15] that's been spoken unto him
[2:11:17] the message Nehemiah has hidden his
[2:11:20] heart
[2:11:21] the burden of God
[2:11:23] he saw the mess he saw all the
[2:11:26] destruction and he's determined to build
[2:11:29] when he comes there the Bible tells us
[2:11:31] there's these two men we hear that
[2:11:34] they're not happy with the coming of
[2:11:36] this man and one of them his name is
[2:11:39] symbolic he's nehemiah's main political
[2:11:42] opponent he's from the city of called
[2:11:45] horanime which is the horanite which is
[2:11:48] a place in Moab and then also we also
[2:11:51] find tobiah the Bible says he is from
[2:11:53] Ammon
[2:11:54] so these are the two brothers you don't
[2:11:56] want in your church
[2:11:58] but these men have been there at
[2:12:00] Jerusalem and in that area all this time
[2:12:03] while this garbage is there and they've
[2:12:05] not we don't hear a word from them until
[2:12:07] a message of restoration begins to come
[2:12:11] and the reason it begins to come is
[2:12:14] because a man is coming to seek the
[2:12:17] welfare of his children you know the
[2:12:19] devil don't get stirred up amen if we
[2:12:21] don't do nothing about the mess he'll
[2:12:24] just lay there and hear enjoy you
[2:12:25] raising your hands and saying amen
[2:12:27] listening to a tape but if there's
[2:12:30] nothing applied and nothing done he
[2:12:33] won't say a word
[2:12:34] you let the message of restoration start
[2:12:37] coming all them old grievances begin to
[2:12:40] rise up all the bitterness begins to
[2:12:43] rise up why because God is determined
[2:12:48] you go ahead and sleep on me if you want
[2:12:52] I want to tell you something there are
[2:12:54] some devils in here that God wants to
[2:12:56] clean out of your life
[2:12:58] these men that have laid there for
[2:13:00] Jennifer for years and affected your
[2:13:02] family and why is it that right by your
[2:13:05] house is the walls broken down and
[2:13:08] you've done nothing about it but the
[2:13:10] enemy can laugh at you and say oh you
[2:13:13] say you believe an end-time message why
[2:13:15] haven't you deal with this anger why
[2:13:17] haven't you asked forgiveness why
[2:13:19] haven't you gone to me this rights
[2:13:21] have you repented of your gossip
[2:13:25] well this is a good last message to
[2:13:28] preach before I'm gone
[2:13:30] I leave tomorrow at 10 if you want to be
[2:13:32] at the airport sell me off
[2:13:34] Hallelujah
[2:13:36] need to go back home and preach it so
[2:13:38] they're looking at me the same way
[2:13:40] preach me happy brother Danny I want to
[2:13:42] preach you amen about a message of
[2:13:44] restoration not interested in making you
[2:13:47] happy I'd rather see people work amen
[2:13:50] and to get the restoration of God
[2:13:52] through their lives you have to keep
[2:13:55] coming back for the same thing over and
[2:13:57] over for when God gets done with you it
[2:14:00] is a glorious city of Zion
[2:14:04] [Applause]
[2:14:12] you ever looked at these two men
[2:14:15] some ballot and tobiah
[2:14:18] have you met him
[2:14:25] you know what I like about the Bible is
[2:14:27] when it comes to Spirits
[2:14:29] God very rarely decides describes well
[2:14:32] he's got big eyes and a crooked nose and
[2:14:34] he's six foot tall and he doesn't do
[2:14:36] that
[2:14:37] he says what they sound like
[2:14:40] because every generation their change
[2:14:41] their appearance
[2:14:43] but their sound doesn't change
[2:14:48] so now we find out that when Nehemiah
[2:14:50] comes
[2:14:51] it provokes a response from these men
[2:14:55] that are there
[2:14:57] you read this story it blows your mind
[2:14:59] what is going on
[2:15:01] but if you read about tobiah he's an
[2:15:04] ammonite and if you read about symbolic
[2:15:07] he is a moabite now the Bible says about
[2:15:09] these two men in the book of Deuteronomy
[2:15:13] um it says this and I'll just read it to
[2:15:15] you in anime ammonite or a moabite shall
[2:15:18] not enter into the congregation of the
[2:15:19] Lord even to their 10th Generation shall
[2:15:22] they not enter into the congregation of
[2:15:24] the Lord forever because they met you
[2:15:27] not with bread and with water in the way
[2:15:28] when you came out of Egypt and because
[2:15:30] they hired against you Balaam the son of
[2:15:33] bior of the pathor of Mesopotamia to
[2:15:36] curse you nevertheless the Lord thy God
[2:15:38] would not hearken unto Balaam but the
[2:15:41] Lord thy God turned the curse into a
[2:15:43] blessing unto thee because the Lord thy
[2:15:46] God has loved thee you shall not seek
[2:15:50] their peace nor their prosperity all the
[2:15:53] days forever
[2:15:55] he's a two men you don't want in your
[2:15:57] congregation
[2:15:58] but were they they were men that they
[2:16:00] were tribes that blocked and hindered
[2:16:04] the the Journey of the chosen people of
[2:16:07] God they were men that hired people to
[2:16:11] find flaws in the church
[2:16:13] to look upon their back parts and put it
[2:16:16] on the internet they they wanted to talk
[2:16:18] about the failures to prove that God
[2:16:21] wasn't there
[2:16:22] because if I can find failures in the
[2:16:24] Church of surely God will curse them
[2:16:26] well I'll tell you there's not one
[2:16:28] Church in the world and I don't care
[2:16:29] what kind of church it is you're going
[2:16:31] to find flaws in everything because this
[2:16:35] is not about man this is about God the
[2:16:39] prophet of God says amen they they
[2:16:41] looked upon them they they were hired to
[2:16:44] curse them he said well what they did
[2:16:45] not see amen the prophet was there amen
[2:16:48] the shadow of the King was in the camp
[2:16:50] amen the the Brazen altar was there amen
[2:16:54] I want to tell you when people look upon
[2:16:56] the flaws they're ignoring the grace
[2:17:02] amen
[2:17:04] so these are opponents well you know
[2:17:06] where these two men started
[2:17:08] these tribes started
[2:17:11] their Origins started in a cave a dark
[2:17:14] place they come from the darkness of a
[2:17:17] cave
[2:17:18] they were begotten from a drunken lot
[2:17:22] with his two daughters
[2:17:24] this is the last we hear of lot in the
[2:17:26] Old Testament
[2:17:27] is he dies
[2:17:29] we don't hear of him anymore
[2:17:31] this is his last place and this is what
[2:17:33] comes out of that it was a man that
[2:17:36] refused to go all the way with the
[2:17:37] message
[2:17:39] it was a man that refused to hear what
[2:17:42] the word was saying to Abraham
[2:17:45] it was a man amen that chose the better
[2:17:47] things of life he thought
[2:17:50] than to stay with the word
[2:17:52] and out of this comes these two tribes
[2:17:55] a spirit that won't go all the way
[2:17:59] spirit that when the angel says go to
[2:18:02] the mountain or go to this place they
[2:18:04] said oh that's too far let me go over
[2:18:06] here please
[2:18:07] changing what the word says when the
[2:18:10] word says go here you say no that's just
[2:18:12] too much
[2:18:16] this is where these men came from
[2:18:19] hindering you can trace them all through
[2:18:21] the Bible these spirits that God said
[2:18:23] don't have anything to do with them and
[2:18:25] don't seek their prosperity
[2:18:27] because they're trying to stop you from
[2:18:29] doing what I want
[2:18:32] Hallelujah
[2:18:34] amen but when Nehemiah comes
[2:18:37] amen let me just say this opposition in
[2:18:39] the work for the Lord is often the proof
[2:18:47] I know I'm not making you too happy yet
[2:18:51] that's okay
[2:18:53] and say when opposition comes
[2:18:58] it's the proof
[2:19:00] that God is doing something
[2:19:11] can I just be me
[2:19:14] in the power of Resurrection
[2:19:19] you know
[2:19:20] my father
[2:19:21] passed away in 2009 I
[2:19:24] and and they elected me as pastor of the
[2:19:26] church
[2:19:27] you know often you hear
[2:19:30] well you're not your dad
[2:19:36] now how do I respond to that
[2:19:42] uh
[2:19:44] uh I'm not
[2:19:48] what they really want to say is you
[2:19:50] don't do things like him
[2:19:55] right but we're all different
[2:19:57] and God oversees it
[2:20:01] and when opposition begins to come
[2:20:05] it's because God is doing something
[2:20:09] and people aren't patient with what God
[2:20:12] is doing
[2:20:14] and they don't allow God to work they'd
[2:20:16] rather try to build on grievances
[2:20:19] to give an excuse for their current
[2:20:21] condition instead of let God Amen
[2:20:25] restore that'll make you fold your arms
[2:20:27] and stare at me
[2:20:36] let me tell you something
[2:20:38] you don't know what it's like to be me
[2:20:43] but that's why we have a God who comes
[2:20:45] in the spirit of restoration if you
[2:20:48] would let him get in the middle of it
[2:20:51] so when when and this isn't for you
[2:20:54] young people to understand you got to
[2:20:56] look bigger than three days in a weekend
[2:20:58] that we've just had
[2:21:00] for you to make a stand for the word of
[2:21:03] God is a living declaration
[2:21:06] it's a living declaration that the work
[2:21:09] of God is in process and that will stir
[2:21:13] your enemy up these two brothers that
[2:21:16] might have laid dormant for a long time
[2:21:19] but when the spirit of God begins to
[2:21:21] expose them they'll start becoming
[2:21:24] against you
[2:21:26] now Nehemiah
[2:21:29] there's not one battle fought in it not
[2:21:32] one physical battle
[2:21:36] it's all about the thought of battle and
[2:21:41] the fear of battle
[2:21:43] and the threat of battle and the LIE of
[2:21:47] battle but there's an uh actually a
[2:21:49] sword ever drawn and somebody run
[2:21:52] through
[2:21:55] because these men
[2:21:57] don't have the power
[2:22:00] that it can only talk
[2:22:06] it's something
[2:22:09] that the enemies want to keep Jerusalem
[2:22:10] in misery
[2:22:14] something that the enemies of Jerusalem
[2:22:16] and the people that live there are
[2:22:18] living together
[2:22:21] and they're not harassing the people
[2:22:25] isn't that amazing
[2:22:27] they're not harassing them because the
[2:22:29] people are no threat to him
[2:22:33] all the time they live there they're
[2:22:35] content to live with the situation
[2:22:36] they're in
[2:22:39] they're content to live
[2:22:41] with how they are
[2:22:44] right and so the enemy doesn't get
[2:22:45] stirred up
[2:22:47] amen that's to his taste
[2:22:50] he likes it you come to church
[2:22:52] Hallelujah
[2:22:54] that's wonderful can I go with you
[2:22:56] make room for me on the Pew next time
[2:23:00] I said I'll remind you everything's
[2:23:01] gonna be okay you know he loves he loves
[2:23:04] to see people in a deceived state of
[2:23:07] mind that they can sit in the same
[2:23:09] condition and receive a blessing and not
[2:23:11] change
[2:23:13] but if you read the Bible it's all about
[2:23:16] change from glory to glory to glory to
[2:23:19] glory going into the Realms of God why
[2:23:21] do you think he gives you why do you
[2:23:23] think he gives you a hunger and a thirst
[2:23:25] amen oh you say well I did this for God
[2:23:28] and I've done that he answered my prayer
[2:23:29] here he did this there God's more than
[2:23:31] that
[2:23:33] you know what God does is he he speaks
[2:23:35] his word and when he speaks his word he
[2:23:36] gives you something to see Jeremiah what
[2:23:39] do you see I see an almond branch
[2:23:42] amen amen before you see it say it you
[2:23:45] had to see it God had to show you amen
[2:23:49] amen it may not be something anybody
[2:23:50] else sees but it's what God showed you
[2:23:52] you may be sick here this morning but if
[2:23:55] God shows you a well body they've been
[2:23:58] standing out before you you say what do
[2:24:00] you see there I see a well back amen and
[2:24:03] I walk toward that path I walk toward
[2:24:05] that well person Jesus Christ stands
[2:24:08] right behind what I see calling to me
[2:24:13] you got to see it God wants you to see
[2:24:15] it
[2:24:16] the people living in a room sitting they
[2:24:18] don't see its former glory they don't
[2:24:20] see its future Glory they only settle
[2:24:23] for for for uh the the misery that's
[2:24:26] there
[2:24:31] amen but when Nehemiah comes
[2:24:34] it's a declaration of war
[2:24:37] against the prevailing condition
[2:24:41] that appears before him
[2:24:46] amen Satan doesn't worry about the
[2:24:49] church in general
[2:24:51] it's those who dedicate themselves to
[2:24:53] the Lord
[2:24:55] dedicate to do his work for the benefit
[2:24:58] of the church
[2:24:59] see we look for the church that pleases
[2:25:01] us when you're actually supposed to be
[2:25:03] in the church to help it
[2:25:07] right
[2:25:09] my smile is fake
[2:25:16] it's true
[2:25:18] because we're supposed to let God work
[2:25:20] through us
[2:25:23] Hallelujah
[2:25:25] now what they didn't understand
[2:25:27] these people sitting there in this
[2:25:29] ruined conditions had the quotes
[2:25:34] they had heard about it now they maybe
[2:25:36] couldn't read and maybe they didn't have
[2:25:37] the physical book but they knew about it
[2:25:41] they knew they were the Seed of Abraham
[2:25:43] they knew they were in line for blessing
[2:25:45] they knew they had inheritance they knew
[2:25:48] that God had said your seed shall
[2:25:50] possess the gates of their enemies but
[2:25:53] their own gates are destroyed and their
[2:25:55] walls are destroyed
[2:25:57] they're not doing anything about it
[2:25:59] right
[2:26:00] you know when we see needs in the church
[2:26:02] it ought to set us to pray yeah it ought
[2:26:04] to set us to intercede for one another
[2:26:06] amen amen when somebody starts just
[2:26:10] talking about it instead of praying
[2:26:12] about it that is not the solution that's
[2:26:14] the brothers that need to be cast out
[2:26:17] amen
[2:26:19] but now here comes Nehemiah and he's
[2:26:22] riding down the road and they're like
[2:26:24] you don't have no authorization to be
[2:26:26] here
[2:26:27] amen do you know when they they tried to
[2:26:30] build the temple and and we told them
[2:26:32] they don't have no right to build the
[2:26:33] temple now you understand the temple was
[2:26:35] already built they did build it but but
[2:26:37] the threats of the people against the
[2:26:40] building of the temple caused them to
[2:26:42] stop building it for 19 years and they
[2:26:45] re they didn't build because of the
[2:26:46] threats they didn't think we're allowed
[2:26:48] to build the temple but God built their
[2:26:50] Temple of worship back and then he wants
[2:26:52] the walls restored and so now and you
[2:26:55] know what's interesting if you go back
[2:26:57] and study that time in the time of Ezra
[2:26:59] he's trying to get them to build the
[2:27:01] temple and God God says these people
[2:27:04] need to be stirred up by a prophet's
[2:27:06] message so he sends him not one Prophet
[2:27:07] but two prophets and I'm sure if they're
[2:27:10] like us we'd all had our favorites
[2:27:14] you ever looked at them
[2:27:16] Zechariah and haggai
[2:27:19] haggai
[2:27:21] Zechariah Zechariah was the man having
[2:27:24] visions
[2:27:25] he's always in heaven
[2:27:27] and he was the young man so it might
[2:27:29] have been kind of dynamic we don't we'd
[2:27:30] like that guy wouldn't we we like him
[2:27:32] had you I was the old guy
[2:27:36] you're welcome
[2:27:38] he was the old guy and he didn't have
[2:27:40] the dynamic personality that Zechariah
[2:27:43] did Zechariah behold I see 12 horses in
[2:27:46] the trees I saw heaven I saw the Throne
[2:27:50] of God and I saw amen this high priest
[2:27:53] in dirty clothes standing there before
[2:27:55] the people going oh my whoo Zechariah
[2:27:59] can I have your tape and then over
[2:28:00] there's had you I said hey guys hey hey
[2:28:02] hey
[2:28:03] you want a house to be built get up
[2:28:06] there on the mountain and cut some wood
[2:28:11] man I'm going to zachariah's church now
[2:28:14] the problem of it is they both went to
[2:28:16] the same church
[2:28:19] and they never fought with one another
[2:28:22] Zechariah didn't look at Hagia I said
[2:28:25] buddy why don't you have more Visions
[2:28:27] man move Beyond chopping wood and
[2:28:29] measuring stuff man that ought to make
[2:28:32] you feel good brother David he he was a
[2:28:34] contractor
[2:28:35] he built churches
[2:28:39] this is good I'm the only one having a
[2:28:42] good time here
[2:28:43] he built churches you know he's like
[2:28:45] he's telling that if you want you built
[2:28:47] your own house now go build the house of
[2:28:49] God you want to do something about it go
[2:28:51] cut some wood into people like uh-huh
[2:28:54] then Zachariah goes yeah I say unto you
[2:29:00] Glory
[2:29:01] well I love Zechariah he's young he's
[2:29:04] Dynamic and can I have your tape
[2:29:07] haggy eyes a few years behind
[2:29:10] what we find in the Bible God sent him
[2:29:12] that way to work together because both
[2:29:14] of them met the need of the people
[2:29:18] if you had only a Zechariah the people
[2:29:21] would be walking up here and ignoring
[2:29:24] everything but you needed a haggy eye
[2:29:26] down here to say I saw what was in your
[2:29:28] closet
[2:29:33] well Hallelujah anyhow amen
[2:29:37] glory to God two more hours of this man

[2:29:58] houses and there's these walls all tore
[2:30:00] down and don't you know God wants these
[2:30:03] walls to be there he wants some built up
[2:30:05] walls of salvation
[2:30:08] laws that tell the enemy you can't go no
[2:30:10] further
[2:30:11] you can't have my children don't you
[2:30:14] know these are Gates of Praise they're
[2:30:16] not supposed to be broken down why
[2:30:19] aren't the walls build up why are you
[2:30:21] only going to church
[2:30:25] well Nehemiah you don't have no right to
[2:30:27] preach like that and the King he does he
[2:30:29] know what you're saying oh I got news
[2:30:31] for you there's been a sealed book given
[2:30:34] to me amen it's the king's message and
[2:30:38] the King's message says give them the
[2:30:40] wood
[2:30:41] from the time restore
[2:30:44] oh my they thought they knew the message
[2:30:48] but they didn't know that there was a
[2:30:50] sealed letter from the King
[2:30:52] authenticated not by Nehemiah but by the
[2:30:55] king seal this message amen was not so a
[2:30:59] sealed by wmb it was sealed amen by the
[2:31:03] king himself and opened up in our hour
[2:31:06] to realize this is the hour of
[2:31:08] restoration no matter how impure no
[2:31:11] matter how beat down the Holy Ghost
[2:31:13] calls and says give it back
[2:31:16] now it's time for your families
[2:31:21] now it's a time for the restoration of
[2:31:23] your children
[2:31:25] now is the time to right the wrongs of
[2:31:27] the past
[2:31:28] to not live in a condition for 20 to 30
[2:31:31] years and praise the Lord and ignore
[2:31:34] what's going on behind you Meanwhile
[2:31:35] your children are starting to death
[2:31:37] because of the spiritual
[2:31:40] famine in your life
[2:31:43] don't teach them to deceive
[2:31:49] my bro my my sons come to me
[2:31:52] and they told me I'm struggling with
[2:31:54] something I didn't sit there and rebuke
[2:31:57] him for being in a struggle
[2:31:59] I took them and I put my arm around them
[2:32:01] and I let them know how much I loved
[2:32:02] them then I knelt with them before God
[2:32:04] and I told God how much I loved them and
[2:32:07] how much he loved them and how God done
[2:32:09] work in me and I know you do the work in
[2:32:11] them I let them know there's somebody
[2:32:14] come on church I did not commit them to
[2:32:18] the cycle of death they had started with
[2:32:19] me amen but I broke the cycle by using
[2:32:23] what the king seal had authorized me to
[2:32:26] do I have been authorized Amen to
[2:32:29] restore
[2:32:30] oh Lord
[2:32:35] I'm finding out
[2:32:38] that people are more interested in how
[2:32:42] they seem before the people
[2:32:45] than actually writing a condition
[2:32:54] I dealt with a condition one time is a
[2:32:56] long time ago and I pray the Lord that
[2:32:57] they don't see this
[2:32:59] amen but it was counseling
[2:33:02] you know and I had a couple there that
[2:33:04] couldn't get along you ever had people
[2:33:05] like that
[2:33:08] marriage you know they couldn't get
[2:33:11] along
[2:33:13] well don't look at him I'm sorry I
[2:33:16] shouldn't have done that to you okay I
[2:33:17] did
[2:33:18] and they couldn't get along and he was
[2:33:20] angry with one another
[2:33:22] they wouldn't talk to me now I found out
[2:33:23] a lot of times in counseling that people
[2:33:25] just want to pour out their grievances
[2:33:27] upon me and then they'll feel better
[2:33:29] they don't change
[2:33:32] they just want somebody else to know
[2:33:34] my walls are broken down
[2:33:37] and I want to be haggy I
[2:33:39] hey get the shovel
[2:33:41] clean it up
[2:33:44] well I had this couple Brother David and
[2:33:46] um
[2:33:47] and and they couldn't get along and they
[2:33:50] fought and they couldn't get along
[2:33:52] and so apartment in the office and and
[2:33:55] we sat down
[2:33:57] and they were
[2:33:58] and they they couldn't even look at one
[2:34:00] another
[2:34:02] and so they they I sat here in front of
[2:34:06] them and then they sat like this back to
[2:34:08] back and looked at me
[2:34:10] that's not a happy marriage
[2:34:13] if you can't even look at one another
[2:34:16] so the man starts telling me
[2:34:19] about the condition and how how she is
[2:34:22] she got this problem she's got that
[2:34:24] problem she got this problem about that
[2:34:25] problem okay yeah now what are you
[2:34:27] saying she's like he's got this problem
[2:34:29] he's got that problem he's got that
[2:34:30] problem you got this and you got all
[2:34:31] this
[2:34:32] but ain't nothing happening
[2:34:35] it ain't gonna build
[2:34:37] Walls by rearranging junk
[2:34:43] well let me carry this pile of garbage
[2:34:45] and just put it over here
[2:34:46] specifically I put it on his lap
[2:34:50] his lap that never fixes anything
[2:34:52] you know this went on for a while you
[2:34:55] know let them let them say how much they
[2:34:56] hate each other
[2:34:58] or hate being around each other whatever
[2:35:01] I finally got you know a little
[2:35:05] I hate to say it aggravated
[2:35:10] and I said now listen all I have heard
[2:35:12] out of you
[2:35:13] is how much you don't of each other's
[2:35:16] faults
[2:35:17] I said you're never accomplish anything
[2:35:21] by saying what's wrong with the other
[2:35:23] that's right I said I want you to do
[2:35:25] something I said you can't even look at
[2:35:26] one another turn and face one another
[2:35:29] and hold each other's hands it took a
[2:35:32] while
[2:35:33] took a while to get there
[2:35:35] is like
[2:35:41] and then take the hands and it was
[2:35:43] you know after you have talked so bad
[2:35:46] about somebody how hard it is to look
[2:35:47] them in the eye
[2:35:52] you know
[2:35:54] your body
[2:35:57] you sing too good oh makes me mad
[2:36:01] I'm tired of these kind of preachers
[2:36:04] just oohs Talent
[2:36:07] why do I have to deal with guys like
[2:36:10] that right now turn and look at him I'm
[2:36:12] like take my hands come on buddy
[2:36:17] now say what you like about him oh come
[2:36:20] on
[2:36:22] you know how hard it is to do that after
[2:36:23] you have just said what you don't like
[2:36:27] because I knew if you can change the
[2:36:29] attitude
[2:36:31] that restoration can start happening
[2:36:35] it took a long time Brother David for
[2:36:37] that man to say something but he finally
[2:36:39] did and it started out real small and
[2:36:41] real insignificant it was
[2:36:46] yes sir that's what I wanted to do
[2:36:49] hey
[2:36:53] Hallelujah
[2:36:55] you know what that brother said
[2:36:57] he looked at her finally after I kept
[2:36:59] encouraging I'll just say something good
[2:37:01] about her I mean there's a lot of things
[2:37:02] that said that was wrong brother
[2:37:04] and sister but finally he looked at her
[2:37:06] and said she makes good cookies
[2:37:12] you know you know it may have to start
[2:37:15] with cookies but God can restore off
[2:37:17] chocolate chip
[2:37:19] [Music]
[2:37:22] hey God can do things you don't think he
[2:37:24] can do and when a man finally said she
[2:37:27] makes good cookies she looked at him and
[2:37:29] she just turned the metals I do you
[2:37:32] hadn't told me that for years amen maybe
[2:37:34] some of you need to look at one another
[2:37:35] and say man you get good groceries
[2:37:40] and you know what happened church when
[2:37:42] they started saying good things then
[2:37:44] another person showed up in the room
[2:37:48] because you were never restored
[2:37:54] God is interested in building up
[2:37:57] salvation he's interested in building up
[2:38:00] praise he is not interested in tearing
[2:38:03] you down
[2:38:05] so why do we do it
[2:38:07] God forgive us
[2:38:09] why do we do it because we're not
[2:38:12] designed to tear one another down we're
[2:38:14] designed to build off
[2:38:16] Nehemiah said I've been riding through
[2:38:18] the congregation and now it's time to
[2:38:20] say this is why I've come it's time for
[2:38:22] you to build the Walls by your house
[2:38:27] don't go build somebody else's wall
[2:38:30] where it's at your house you build that
[2:38:32] it's for you and for your children
[2:38:39] Hallelujah
[2:38:41] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:38:43] God will work on something insignificant
[2:38:45] when he dropped down in the middle of
[2:38:47] that couple I stood up and said I don't
[2:38:49] need to counsel you anymore
[2:38:51] now you need to let him do the work
[2:38:54] because he'll move on confession
[2:39:02] when you do it I just want to say just a
[2:39:04] few more things but if you if you look
[2:39:06] in this book and you go read it yourself
[2:39:08] and ask the Lord to just show you what
[2:39:09] has happened there
[2:39:11] you read this book when when these men
[2:39:13] got stirred up because Nehemiah was
[2:39:15] coming to help the people
[2:39:17] they started mocking him
[2:39:20] this was their attack they attacked him
[2:39:23] in three different ways they doubted his
[2:39:26] purpose they doubted his calling
[2:39:28] then they doubted his purpose and then
[2:39:31] they started rumors about him
[2:39:35] it was all psychological warfare
[2:39:38] Satan has used that
[2:39:40] for decades for generations for
[2:39:43] millenniums he's used the greatest
[2:39:45] battle ever fought
[2:39:47] he's used psychological warfare what
[2:39:50] people think instead of what actually is
[2:39:53] psyops is is a is a a division that they
[2:39:57] use in war to try to work on the minds
[2:40:01] of the people to expect defeat
[2:40:04] amen when when Alexander the Great was
[2:40:06] in Retreat from a place and he said the
[2:40:08] enemy is going to follow us and we're
[2:40:10] going to be we're going to be defeated
[2:40:12] if they realize how weak we are he had
[2:40:15] his men make armor that would fit 10 to
[2:40:18] 12 foot men
[2:40:20] and leave it behind in the camp so that
[2:40:23] the enemy when they came upon the camp
[2:40:25] would think they were refighting men
[2:40:26] that were 10 foot tall
[2:40:31] psyops so when the men come up on that
[2:40:33] camp they're like man we ain't gonna
[2:40:34] follow these guys who in the world do
[2:40:37] they have
[2:40:40] the Egyptians in the time of I don't
[2:40:43] know that guy's name it starts with the
[2:40:44] c colimas or something and and this
[2:40:47] other nation was coming in they they
[2:40:49] read about they they read about these
[2:40:51] people that they were afraid of cats and
[2:40:53] in the cats eyes were the was the the
[2:40:56] light of life and they they were afraid
[2:40:58] to touch them so there was a worship
[2:41:00] thing so these men went and caught as
[2:41:02] many cats as they could and they tied
[2:41:04] them to their to their armor and they
[2:41:06] came on after him and then they caught
[2:41:07] as many cats as they could and they set
[2:41:09] them loose in front of the armies of
[2:41:11] those Egyptians and guess who won
[2:41:14] the guys that we're not afraid of the
[2:41:16] cats
[2:41:17] psyops working on Superstition and what
[2:41:20] people think
[2:41:23] Satan hasn't changed you start little
[2:41:26] labels and things amongst congregations
[2:41:28] talk about people I don't like haggy I
[2:41:30] to you no man he he has one sermon chuck
[2:41:33] wood chuck wood chop wood chop wood
[2:41:36] you know we start labels on one another
[2:41:39] you need to stop it because that's what
[2:41:41] these two brothers did
[2:41:44] that God said I don't want them in my
[2:41:46] congregation
[2:41:47] they start rumors
[2:41:49] they doubt your calling
[2:41:51] you know I've had people doubt my
[2:41:53] calling
[2:41:54] but I'm glad it wasn't them that called
[2:41:56] me
[2:42:02] I said Hey brother Danny I think you're
[2:42:04] called to preach I said oh thank you I
[2:42:05] thought it too so I'll just go ahead and
[2:42:07] decide to do it no it was God that
[2:42:10] called me from my heart
[2:42:11] if I had to rest upon somebody calling
[2:42:14] me then they might call me back and say
[2:42:15] listen buddy we were wrong
[2:42:20] oh
[2:42:21] amen amen you gotta know you gotta know
[2:42:25] and Nehemiah knew who had called him
[2:42:29] it didn't matter how many Tobias and Sun
[2:42:32] balance there was he knew he came with
[2:42:34] the burden of the Lord
[2:42:38] so they mocked him they said what what
[2:42:40] you're going to go and you're going to
[2:42:42] try to rebuild that mess and he said I'm
[2:42:44] determined God has sent me to build that
[2:42:46] mess well you know they've been in that
[2:42:49] condition for years it's not going to be
[2:42:51] rebuilt back he said but you don't
[2:42:52] understand the burden that I have on my
[2:42:54] heart and the word is behind me and I've
[2:42:57] got the king's letters and I got the
[2:42:59] wood amen and I got the desire and now
[2:43:02] I'm going to preach a message and these
[2:43:04] people that don't have the desire soon
[2:43:06] will have it because my burden will
[2:43:08] become their burden and there become
[2:43:11] stirred and they'll start looking at the
[2:43:13] wall right by their house and they'll
[2:43:14] start building Brick by Brick and if
[2:43:17] you're afraid of the enemy pull your
[2:43:19] sword amen and put a brick in the other
[2:43:21] hand and start building that wall and if
[2:43:24] you can't do both at the same time then
[2:43:26] you better quit what you're doing
[2:43:29] if you can't juggle both then you better
[2:43:31] if you can't hold both if you can't hold
[2:43:33] a career here and the word here amen and
[2:43:36] it's only holding a career then you
[2:43:37] better drop the career
[2:43:40] right that's right come on now church
[2:43:42] amen because God wants the walls rebuilt
[2:43:45] he's not interested in you become famous
[2:43:47] or Rich he wants the walls rebuilt
[2:43:50] [Music]
[2:43:53] well blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:43:57] so what did the enemy do he uses
[2:44:00] imagination
[2:44:02] as I mentioned that last night that
[2:44:04] he'll study your static strategy how you
[2:44:06] use the word he didn't say how you use
[2:44:08] your job he said how you use the word
[2:44:11] he studies it he said now you never want
[2:44:15] to reason with God's word just believe
[2:44:18] it don't even try to explain it
[2:44:23] don't try to figure it out
[2:44:26] you cannot figure out God so God is the
[2:44:30] word and it's just made to believe
[2:44:34] and that's our strengths to accept the
[2:44:38] words
[2:44:39] and anyone knows a seed in the right
[2:44:42] kind of ground will produce its kind oh
[2:44:45] my how many people amen that we're out
[2:44:48] in darkness but the word went over the
[2:44:51] seed and the seed produced what was in
[2:44:53] it what was in it the same word that was
[2:44:56] being preached
[2:44:58] oh that's a miracle
[2:45:02] Satan has kept people under control
[2:45:05] because he's had the people trying to
[2:45:07] work through one of the Outlets of the
[2:45:08] Mind
[2:45:09] instead of from the word anchored in the
[2:45:11] heart
[2:45:13] that's what psyops is
[2:45:15] directing the way you think and
[2:45:16] influencing your actions as a direct
[2:45:18] result of this Warfare
[2:45:21] and if he can get you to think well I
[2:45:24] came for prayer I didn't feel any
[2:45:26] different I'm going to go right back to
[2:45:27] the same things I used to be into I feel
[2:45:29] different you've totally missed what the
[2:45:31] word told you to do the word said you
[2:45:33] may not feel different but you believed
[2:45:36] you're different if you believe you're
[2:45:38] different you keep saying you're
[2:45:39] different you keep saying the word is
[2:45:41] true and God not you God will make the
[2:45:45] word your body come into the word
[2:45:47] confession he is the high priest of your
[2:45:51] confession
[2:45:55] amen
[2:45:57] blessed be the name of the Lord God will
[2:46:00] show up yeah yeah caught on work you've
[2:46:02] got to stand
[2:46:06] you know I've been around long enough
[2:46:08] many of you know my testimony already
[2:46:10] but I just want to say it some of you
[2:46:11] that haven't been around long enough
[2:46:14] you know I came out of the contested a
[2:46:16] contested Union a a war my family my
[2:46:20] home was a war
[2:46:24] and if you've ever read if you've ever
[2:46:25] read the quote of brother Branham he's
[2:46:28] asked the question question answers
[2:46:30] 1964. brother Madam I have two daughters
[2:46:32] married to men in denominations
[2:46:35] they've received opposition what should
[2:46:37] they do
[2:46:39] hold fast Show Your Colors
[2:46:45] I don't say don't go around them and
[2:46:46] fellowship with them but you know what
[2:46:47] Dove can't eat with a buzzard
[2:46:49] that's all he said
[2:46:51] that was my mother
[2:46:54] that was my aunt
[2:46:56] and I want you to know I am the word
[2:46:58] made flesh
[2:47:00] that that word that advice from that
[2:47:03] word works
[2:47:06] it don't only preserve it saves it don't
[2:47:09] only save it pulls
[2:47:12] but you gotta Hold Your Position
[2:47:15] that's right
[2:47:18] my mother received opposition for 10
[2:47:20] years my dad would periodically empty
[2:47:23] her closet out throw her stuff out in
[2:47:25] the yard say get out of my home and it
[2:47:27] finally come down to a place he said to
[2:47:29] brother man's in heaven he didn't call
[2:47:30] him brother he said to William Brown's
[2:47:31] in heaven I don't want to go and he
[2:47:32] moved her all over the country
[2:47:33] California New Mexico we bought places
[2:47:36] bound to Florida I was born back to Ohio
[2:47:38] trying to get her out of the message and
[2:47:40] he couldn't get her out of it she had
[2:47:42] her times a doubt because you're going
[2:47:44] through opposition and persecution and
[2:47:46] opposition but my grandmother see I like
[2:47:49] the book of Timothy where he said I'm
[2:47:51] persuaded amen the faith that's in your
[2:47:53] grandmother was in your mother is also
[2:47:55] in you amen and my grandmother amen who
[2:47:58] was a Mennonite converted Mennonite went
[2:48:00] to work for somebody called Bill Dow
[2:48:02] Bill DAL to introduce her to the message
[2:48:04] she lived she worked in that home he
[2:48:07] carried her down to the to the the Met
[2:48:09] to the meetings of William Branham and
[2:48:11] she was converted and then the daughters
[2:48:13] were converted amen and then my dad got
[2:48:17] stirred up when Nehemiah began to come
[2:48:19] into the home and begin to say this is
[2:48:22] the time to seek your welfare and he
[2:48:25] began to say you're not going to serve
[2:48:26] that you know he wasn't a good
[2:48:27] denominational man until he got
[2:48:29] threatened
[2:48:31] you know people are satisfied with
[2:48:33] status quo right satisfied with
[2:48:36] nostalgic things and going where their
[2:48:37] mother went and gone where their
[2:48:39] grandmother went and if you're not
[2:48:40] careful it'll happen in the message
[2:48:42] where people become the second and the
[2:48:44] third generation and the Embers of God
[2:48:46] will die out
[2:48:49] let me get satisfied
[2:48:53] amen
[2:48:55] my dad did everything he could to get
[2:48:57] her out of the message
[2:48:59] Amen to come down to a time that my
[2:49:02] uncle who has been fighting in Vietnam
[2:49:04] came home and he by the time he got home
[2:49:07] you enjoy this Brother David you
[2:49:09] couldn't you couldn't you could he was
[2:49:10] in the it was in the early 70s he was a
[2:49:13] hippie he was all racked out on drugs
[2:49:16] and everything else and God saved him
[2:49:21] God saved him he wanted to be baptized
[2:49:23] and my mom wanted to go see it
[2:49:25] so she told her I can remember hold on
[2:49:27] to my mom's clothes when my dad screamed
[2:49:30] at her and you'd never know my dad if
[2:49:32] you if you'd have seen him later but
[2:49:34] then the way he was the persecution he
[2:49:36] brought
[2:49:37] he would take us to his church and he'd
[2:49:39] tell us don't believe what your mama
[2:49:40] believed she's in a cult
[2:49:41] I can remember that then Mom would take
[2:49:43] us to the church and we'd sit there and
[2:49:45] listen to tapes and that go with Dad and
[2:49:47] then go with Mom amen but there had been
[2:49:49] a promise given whole fast
[2:49:53] hold fast
[2:49:56] amen and so that time came that that he
[2:49:59] was going my uncle was going to get
[2:50:00] baptized and my mom wanted to go and and
[2:50:02] dad said now if you go when you get back
[2:50:05] I'm gone and the children are gone I'm
[2:50:07] finished
[2:50:10] I hear you're speaking to a mother what
[2:50:12] are you gonna do you want to lose your
[2:50:13] family now your family's going to be
[2:50:14] split you're going to lose your children
[2:50:15] something rose up in her and said I'm
[2:50:16] gonna go anyhow
[2:50:18] don't go anyhow
[2:50:20] though God slay me yet I'll trust him
[2:50:22] I'm going to go anyhow okay she made her
[2:50:24] stand showed her colors
[2:50:26] all right you got to show what you
[2:50:29] believe
[2:50:30] you can't just do it in the atmosphere
[2:50:31] of church let me tell you this is the
[2:50:33] easiest place to raise your hand and say
[2:50:35] Amen
[2:50:38] and many people get misguided because
[2:50:40] they can say Amen in church
[2:50:43] right
[2:50:46] oh my
[2:50:48] God oh you get out there though
[2:50:51] what do you believe uh you know I'm not
[2:50:53] issue
[2:50:59] there's a reproach with this brother
[2:51:00] Billy
[2:51:03] amen
[2:51:07] mom says she's going anyhow
[2:51:09] she'd done her part now God said I'll do
[2:51:11] mine
[2:51:14] and so my dad being the tough guy he is
[2:51:16] he started to cry
[2:51:18] because he felt sorry for himself he
[2:51:20] said they were not tears of repentance
[2:51:21] he said they were crocodile tears he
[2:51:24] said I didn't really want to send my
[2:51:25] wife away and and and and split the home
[2:51:28] but I could didn't know what else to do
[2:51:30] I was sick of it and he said my
[2:51:32] conversation my conversion never
[2:51:34] happened in the church it never happened
[2:51:37] at an altar my conversion was in the
[2:51:39] kitchen
[2:51:41] he said I turned around put my hands in
[2:51:43] my pockets and started crying because I
[2:51:45] knew I have made something that I don't
[2:51:47] really want to do and when he'd done
[2:51:49] that God dropped down
[2:51:50] when God dropped down my dad turned
[2:51:52] around to my my mother and he said I'll
[2:51:55] take you
[2:52:00] and a week later he was baptized
[2:52:04] I want you to know
[2:52:08] thank you
[2:52:11] I am the word made flesh of somebody's
[2:52:17] testimony who refused to back up to the
[2:52:20] devil and to the mockery of some Mallet
[2:52:22] and the mockery of tobiah that says it
[2:52:25] will not work I want you to know it
[2:52:27] works
[2:52:27] [Applause]
[2:52:32] my God is able to take a heart that is
[2:52:34] full of hatred
[2:52:36] and I remember years later my dad my dad
[2:52:40] liked to say I was 40 years in the
[2:52:41] message 10 against it and 34 inch amen
[2:52:45] and then uh I can remember after he went
[2:52:47] on to be the Lord let me tell you you
[2:52:49] don't think God's real my my dad wasn't
[2:52:51] a dynamic man he was probably a haggy
[2:52:53] eye
[2:52:54] you know he knew how he was a contractor
[2:52:56] too and he knew how to do wood and I'm
[2:52:58] not saying you're not oh my goodness
[2:53:00] this is a bad way
[2:53:01] Glory love you brother David you're
[2:53:03] wonderful amen but but what I'm saying
[2:53:06] is he actually told me he didn't take
[2:53:08] the humility of a man who's been a
[2:53:09] pastor for over 30 years and he told me
[2:53:11] towards the end of his life he said
[2:53:13] Danny I don't even know how to close a
[2:53:14] service
[2:53:17] let me look at him I don't want to hear
[2:53:18] him
[2:53:19] yeah I've heard it said by people that
[2:53:21] left the message preachers he don't know
[2:53:23] how to preach his way out in a paper bag
[2:53:27] well must have been a good paper bag
[2:53:28] because he he stayed with the word and
[2:53:31] they didn't
[2:53:32] you see it's not about personality
[2:53:36] it's not who we like the most I saw that
[2:53:39] man who might not been dynamic in
[2:53:41] preaching but stand on a corner and
[2:53:43] people pop beer tabs in his face and he
[2:53:45] witnessed the gospel until the church
[2:53:47] was built
[2:53:49] he might not have been a pre able to
[2:53:51] preach out of a pre a paper bag but he
[2:53:53] could witness the words I saw him walk
[2:53:55] into a room with 19 preachers and stand
[2:53:57] for the message
[2:53:59] this is a man that hated it and now he's
[2:54:01] standing for it that's my God my God
[2:54:05] knows how to build the walls
[2:54:12] I remember brother Billy I had a woman
[2:54:15] come to church and she took a track from
[2:54:17] out front it was serpent seat you know
[2:54:19] you know I've heard people say well I'm
[2:54:20] sorry I hope you don't say it here but I
[2:54:21] heard people say you know don't talk to
[2:54:23] people about serpency just tell them
[2:54:24] about Jesus well you know our church was
[2:54:26] built on serpent seed I just got to tell
[2:54:27] you that's the way it was we'd go into
[2:54:29] the house and my dad would go hey what
[2:54:30] do you think happened in the garden you
[2:54:32] know I think this is why it was with him
[2:54:34] because he was so much against it when
[2:54:36] God changed his heart he just let him
[2:54:38] off that's where he started where he
[2:54:40] hated the most
[2:54:41] yeah
[2:54:43] I'm not saying that's how you have to do
[2:54:44] it here okay
[2:54:46] you know go build some wood or something
[2:54:47] do something
[2:54:48] amen and I remember those woman's is
[2:54:51] going dads went on to be with the Lord
[2:54:52] and I saw him die I was there I know how
[2:54:54] a saint dies
[2:54:55] they don't die afraid
[2:54:58] come on I know what God does
[2:55:01] amen I I know when he was dying he
[2:55:04] didn't think he was going to die he
[2:55:05] thought God was going to raise him up
[2:55:06] he's going back in the Pulpit again he
[2:55:07] stood up and testified I'm going to be
[2:55:09] I'm healed amen and then then we're
[2:55:11] sitting there we're watching him go down
[2:55:12] and and fear came down upon me four
[2:55:14] o'clock at night in the hospital and God
[2:55:16] told me he said this Soldier has fallen
[2:55:18] but he's only fallen asleep
[2:55:21] okay
[2:55:23] he arise again
[2:55:25] he'll rise in perfect health
[2:55:28] now I know amen when my dad was starting
[2:55:30] to go into that coma and he couldn't go
[2:55:32] to church anymore that was as great as
[2:55:33] he thought I just got to get to church
[2:55:34] and he couldn't go to church anymore so
[2:55:36] we went there and had church with him I
[2:55:37] laid the Bible up by his head he's
[2:55:39] laying there his mouth is open his eyes
[2:55:41] are rolled back but I begin to read he
[2:55:43] prepares a table before me in the
[2:55:45] presence and I watch those eyes come
[2:55:47] rolling back down and before long they
[2:55:50] sharpened and then they begin and I
[2:55:52] stopped quoting and he continued talking
[2:55:54] amen I watched God have church with him
[2:55:57] I know how a saint dies he doesn't die
[2:56:00] afraid

[2:58:42] wanted to talk about all that was wrong
[2:58:43] with the message now now you forgive me
[2:58:45] for the way this sounds but this is the
[2:58:46] way it was she had hair shorter than
[2:58:48] mine
[2:58:49] and she wanted to talk about it I didn't
[2:58:51] say it she wanted to talk about it one
[2:58:54] thing you guys believe you believe this
[2:58:55] about the hair and everything else but
[2:58:57] you just follow what a man says all I
[2:59:00] did was start quoting the word I never
[2:59:01] quoted anything but the Bible that's all
[2:59:04] I quoted she quit quoting the Bible and
[2:59:06] started quoting words that I couldn't
[2:59:08] actually pronounce
[2:59:09] and I looked her I said ma'am those
[2:59:11] words are not in the Bible why don't we
[2:59:14] just quote the word and she got madder
[2:59:15] than a hornet she jumped out of her
[2:59:17] chair and said I know where you're
[2:59:19] getting that I said where are my
[2:59:20] goodnesses you're getting it from
[2:59:21] William Bradham
[2:59:22] and I said ma'am I have done nothing but
[2:59:25] quote First Corinthians 11 and you said
[2:59:27] I'm getting from William Branham I said
[2:59:29] you just paid him the greatest
[2:59:31] compliment you could pay him
[2:59:33] because this Prophet I'm following is
[2:59:37] not coming with a cunningly divised
[2:59:39] Fable amen it's not out of his own
[2:59:40] imagination it is the power of God unto
[2:59:44] salvation
[2:59:47] Hallelujah and this is the hour of
[2:59:50] restoration
[2:59:52] I gotta close I didn't preach about
[2:59:55] Nehemiah enough you can go read it
[2:59:56] yourself three things doubted their
[2:59:59] calling mocked his calling doubted his
[3:00:01] purpose mocked his purpose started
[3:00:04] rumors on him
[3:00:06] and he never gave in to him one time but
[3:00:10] it come down to the end he found out
[3:00:12] when they got the walls built because
[3:00:14] they got them built God's a god of
[3:00:16] restoration they got them built the
[3:00:17] people built it in 52 days
[3:00:22] miracle
[3:00:24] they lived like that
[3:00:27] for Generations
[3:00:29] but when Spirit of restoration come
[3:00:32] right he done a quick work
[3:00:34] and restored them
[3:00:36] and when they restored the walls they
[3:00:39] called the people together and they
[3:00:40] asked Ezra to bring the word and he
[3:00:43] opened up the word let me tell you you
[3:00:45] see the word like never before when
[3:00:47] restoration comes into your life and
[3:00:49] they opened it up and the Bible says the
[3:00:51] men stood and read the law and made the
[3:00:54] sense to the people and the people begin
[3:00:57] to weep because they saw they had been
[3:00:59] wrong and Nehemiah walked out and said
[3:01:01] listen this is not a day to weep anymore
[3:01:04] this is a day to Rejoice because now God
[3:01:08] is being exalted and it's time to
[3:01:10] rejoice and make a feast because he is
[3:01:13] restoration
[3:01:15] yes sir you know the thing of it he
[3:01:18] found out last thing he found out I
[3:01:20] think is is chapter 13 you go study
[3:01:22] chapter 13 through the Bible you find a
[3:01:24] lot of things happen in chapter 13. they
[3:01:26] found out that tobiah the ammonite
[3:01:29] had been given a room in the temple to
[3:01:33] live
[3:01:35] and that room had been reserved for the
[3:01:37] tithe and offering for the Levites and
[3:01:40] instead they made a room
[3:01:42] for him there because he had allies in
[3:01:45] the congregation
[3:01:49] that was the last work of Nehemiah he
[3:01:51] goes what in the world are you doing you
[3:01:55] have let him come all the way to the
[3:01:57] temple and a man who's not supposed to
[3:02:00] enter in there you have allowed him to
[3:02:02] stay there why do you think nothing's
[3:02:05] going to change if you allow these
[3:02:06] hindering blocking things stay in your
[3:02:09] life you've got to clean them out
[3:02:11] because they have no right they have no
[3:02:14] Heritage here they have no Memorial you
[3:02:18] say brother Danny what are you saying
[3:02:19] I'm saying if you have ought against
[3:02:21] your brother if you said some against
[3:02:23] anybody then things can never be
[3:02:25] restored around you in that remain that
[3:02:28] has to be cleaned out of the place to
[3:02:30] worship the place that is reserved for
[3:02:32] tithe and offering your sacrifices
[3:02:35] occupied by an enemy and I'm not saying
[3:02:38] you as this church I'm saying you as in
[3:02:40] whoever the Lord is talking to it's time

[3:16:09] sinner saved by grace

[3:16:21] told me never leave me or never forsake
[3:16:23] me me be with me even in me till the end
[3:16:26] and
[3:16:29] full of complexes and

[3:16:47] take care of one another there might be
[3:16:49] visitors that don't have a place to go

[3:20:35] now
[3:20:37] we're crazy
[3:20:39] We Believe

[3:20:45] one day we're gonna be walking down
[3:20:48] around here and we are going to fly away
[3:20:54] yep we're gonna walk out of these bodies
[3:20:57] that's right
[3:21:01] [Music]
[3:21:09] [Music]
[3:21:13] I want you to know that there was a one
[3:21:17] that came from Heaven yes yeah that's
[3:21:19] right and he appeared in a in a body
[3:21:22] just like us yeah and he went to the
[3:21:25] cross and he gave his blood to forgive
[3:21:27] me of everything I ever done and they
[3:21:30] buried them just like they buried every
[3:21:33] other man before
[3:21:35] but he come out of the ground
[3:21:39] and not only did he come out of the
[3:21:41] grave
[3:21:42] he flew away
[3:21:44] right and there were those Among Us
[3:21:47] whose song Fly Away yeah
[3:21:51] and they they told us he flew away and
[3:21:55] then he told us
[3:21:57] that he's gonna come back again all
[3:21:59] right
[3:22:01] and they said oh
[3:22:04] he said but he left us in evidence
[3:22:09] he gave us something and that proved
[3:22:12] that was true and we call that the
[3:22:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:22:19] he gave us an experience he he the very
[3:22:22] spirit that raised him from the dead
[3:22:25] right
[3:22:26] the very spirit that quick in his Spirit
[3:22:29] he sent that same Spirit back on us
[3:22:32] hallelujah
[3:22:34] so now I have the same Spirit yes
[3:22:38] quickened him because he said if the
[3:22:41] spirit does win Christ Jesus dwells in
[3:22:44] you it will also Quicken your mortal
[3:22:47] body amen now he said that Spirit that's
[3:22:51] going to make that change is a gift from
[3:22:54] God
[3:22:55] and he gives it to every
[3:22:59] believer in every person who asked for
[3:23:03] it
[3:23:03] [Music]
[3:23:05] so we get it all mixed up
[3:23:08] we think oh I want this spirit so I can
[3:23:11] live right I don't want the spirit out
[3:23:13] of liver I want the spirit so I can fly
[3:23:15] away
[3:23:18] I don't like this place
[3:23:23] and if you didn't have the spirit of God
[3:23:25] I probably wouldn't like you
[3:23:30] foreign
[3:23:32] but he gave us life
[3:23:35] [Music]
[3:23:36] the very life that took him out of the
[3:23:40] Grave the very life that he flew away
[3:23:44] with he sent it back I will not leave
[3:23:49] you comfortless but I personal pronouns
[3:23:53] will come again I'll be with you even in
[3:23:57] you till the end that's what we're
[3:24:00] asking you this morning do
[3:24:02] have that
[3:24:04] that's Jesus
[3:24:08] that's the spirit of God
[3:24:14] it's his gift to you
[3:24:18] and you said oh what do I got to do ask
[3:24:21] for it
[3:24:23] what's the evidence of it
[3:24:27] I don't know
[3:24:30] he tried to make one evidence fit all
[3:24:33] this isn't a fit all gospel it's a fit
[3:24:36] me gospel
[3:24:39] Spirit he sent me of himself fit me
[3:24:43] and it fits you because it's personal
[3:24:48] so just remember we're we're not here
[3:24:51] just to be the greatest moral people in
[3:24:54] the world
[3:24:55] we live morally because we love him
[3:24:59] but we're here to leave
[3:25:02] this is not a staying gospel it's a
[3:25:06] leaving gospel now I want to ask you how
[3:25:09] many want to fly away
[3:25:11] [Music]
[3:25:14] if you want to fly away ask yourself one
[3:25:17] simple question do I have his Spirit his
[3:25:23] gift in me right or is the devil
[3:25:28] trying to put chains on me and hold me
[3:25:32] here so you're flapping your wins and
[3:25:35] he's pulling you down remember Johnny
[3:25:38] Crowe had the ring on him so long they
[3:25:42] finally cut the string and he couldn't
[3:25:44] fly
[3:25:45] I don't want to live like that
[3:25:48] and so it's a simple question you gotta
[3:25:51] ask yourself do I want to live for the
[3:25:54] Lord
[3:25:55] Lord I want to live for you my heart's
[3:25:58] telling me the seed inside of me is
[3:26:01] telling me I hear the Deep calling to
[3:26:03] the Deep what can I do
[3:26:06] what can I do
[3:26:09] repent
[3:26:10] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[3:26:13] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[3:26:16] gift of Holy Ghost if you've already
[3:26:18] been baptized
[3:26:21] and you just don't know that that life's
[3:26:24] in you we'll be happy to pray for you
[3:26:28] we don't have to empty this fill this
[3:26:30] altar up and let her we can just simply
[3:26:33] lay our hands on you
[3:26:36] and say father may they receive the Holy
[3:26:38] Ghost
[3:26:40] and we'll do it after service is over

[3:26:50] [Music]
[3:26:53] yes don't leave here if you don't have
[3:26:55] him
[3:26:56] he's giving you the opportunity let me
[3:26:59] say it this way don't leave here without
[3:27:01] the desire in your heart to have him
[3:27:05] because it's a gift I can't give it he
[3:27:08] can give it
[3:27:09] but you walk from this place this

[3:35:06] whether they're gonna enter into the
[3:35:08] restoration of their

[3:35:14] and they haven't served you with all
[3:35:16] their heart and kept your ways
