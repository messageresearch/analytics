[9:49] visitors you can turn around and welcome
[9:50] someone I mean that's invite by the mic
[9:52] for us home reading this morning
[10:03] may God bless you may have your seats
[10:15] good morning
[10:17] You Know It uh
[10:20] was thinking this weekend you know at
[10:22] some point
[10:23] I was listening to some other services
[10:26] and it occurred to me at some point
[10:29] you know each of us is going to
[10:31] encounter worship services that at a
[10:34] different church somewhere
[10:36] whether that's another one of our sister
[10:37] churches or
[10:39] whether it's just one of the
[10:41] you know the many versions of church
[10:43] that are out
[10:44] in the world today
[10:47] you know whether whatever it is at some
[10:49] point we're gonna you know experience
[10:51] different kind of worship service
[10:54] you know you'll find every church is a
[10:56] little bit different
[10:57] some
[10:58] fairly similar some very different
[11:02] you know there's nothing wrong with that
[11:04] but you know
[11:07] I'm not suggesting that there's any
[11:08] perfect worship service but
[11:11] you know as long as worship is a result
[11:14] of the word
[11:16] and not the music
[11:18] or the volume of the worship leader
[11:22] you know then it's
[11:25] it's worship
[11:28] you know something you might
[11:29] occasionally see in a worship service
[11:31] somewhere is
[11:33] you know perhaps one of the worship
[11:35] leaders or someone else beginning to
[11:37] quote some of the Psalms
[11:40] you know and maybe as a way to encourage
[11:42] the people to worship
[11:45] you know whether it's in the middle of a
[11:47] worship service at church sometimes
[11:48] you'll hear it you know even on the
[11:50] radio
[11:52] but you know one of these worship
[11:54] leaders might get up and start quoting
[11:55] things like let us sing unto the Lord
[11:59] let us Make a Joyful Noise
[12:01] to the rock of our salvation
[12:05] let us come before his presence with
[12:07] Thanksgiving
[12:10] and Make a Joyful Noise unto him
[12:13] sing unto him sing unto the Lord bless
[12:16] his name show forth his salvation from
[12:19] day to day
[12:21] the Lord reineth let the Earth rejoice
[12:25] let the multitudes be glad
[12:28] you know and as someone begins to say
[12:31] these things you
[12:33] you know the people might begin to
[12:35] praise even more
[12:38] you know the music might start going
[12:40] louder
[12:43] and you'll hear the excitement of the
[12:45] people as they
[12:46] remember some of these things but again
[12:48] that's fine as long as it's the word
[12:52] Psalm 95 is one of these chapters
[12:56] that is often used at least that I've
[12:58] heard
[13:00] you know during a time of worship
[13:02] somewhere someone might speak of these
[13:04] things to encourage and remind the
[13:06] people to worship but
[13:09] you know it's a it's a wonderful
[13:11] scripture but as I was reading that this
[13:13] weekend
[13:14] I thought as I was reading that it
[13:16] occurred to me
[13:18] what if
[13:21] what if
[13:23] this wasn't about music or a church
[13:25] service at all
[13:29] what if it was instead
[13:31] an interaction between me
[13:34] and God
[13:36] alone
[13:38] how might that change
[13:40] how I look at this scripture
[13:45] you know look at a couple of examples in
[13:47] verse one
[13:49] O Come
[13:51] let us
[13:53] let me
[13:55] sing unto the Lord
[13:58] let us
[14:01] let me
[14:02] Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our
[14:06] salvation
[14:07] it's interesting as you read that he is
[14:10] the recipient
[14:12] the receiver
[14:14] of my song
[14:19] it's a song a noise a sound going forth
[14:22] from me
[14:24] that is something he can receive
[14:29] did you know each of us has a song
[14:32] a sound that goes forth out of our lives
[14:36] you know just as in an orchestra each
[14:39] instrument might produce a different
[14:41] sound
[14:42] based on how it's manufactured
[14:45] or crafted
[14:47] or an acquire each person might have a
[14:50] different voice based on how they're
[14:52] built
[14:54] and then the conductor or the leader
[14:56] will take and mix each and every one of
[14:59] these sounds together to receive the
[15:02] sound
[15:03] that he wants to hear
[15:06] you know so is it
[15:08] like us each of us has a unique sound
[15:11] that comes forth out of us
[15:13] that has been crafted and molded and
[15:17] shaped
[15:18] by the great conductor
[15:22] Oh Come
[15:24] let us
[15:26] let me
[15:29] sing unto the Lord
[15:32] you know when we read examples in the
[15:34] Book of Revelation of people that we're
[15:36] worshiping and singing the pattern
[15:38] that's in heaven
[15:41] the song that's continually going forth
[15:43] from the worshipers Revelation 7
[15:46] blessing and glory and wisdom and
[15:51] Thanksgiving in honor and power and
[15:55] might be unto our God
[15:58] forever and ever
[16:01] the sound that is continually going
[16:03] forth
[16:05] out of the people
[16:07] is blessing to God glory to God honor to
[16:12] God praise
[16:13] to God it's all talking about his power
[16:16] his might his works his ways
[16:21] and that if that's the sound that we're
[16:23] continuously making over there
[16:26] then should not that also be the sound
[16:28] that we're making over here where the
[16:31] song coming forth continually out of our
[16:33] life is the power of God the works of
[16:36] God the honor of God the glory of God
[16:41] every day continuously a sound
[16:45] a song Going forth out of our lives
[16:49] a continual sound peace
[16:52] of him
[16:54] O come let us
[16:56] let me sing unto the Lord
[17:01] that I may sing the song he has crafted
[17:03] for me to sing continuously
[17:07] Paul said it this way in Ephesians 2 10
[17:09] for we are his workmanship
[17:13] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[17:15] with God hath before ordained that we
[17:18] should walk in them
[17:19] crafted
[17:21] to make a sound
[17:24] verse 2 let us
[17:26] let me
[17:28] come before his presence with
[17:30] Thanksgiving
[17:32] again what if this has nothing to do
[17:34] with the church service
[17:38] in spite of how nice this building is or
[17:40] the building that we're building over
[17:42] there
[17:43] God's presence is not in buildings
[17:48] or even honestly in church services
[17:50] necessarily
[17:54] you know as Paul told the worshipers in
[17:56] Acts 17
[17:57] [Music]
[18:00] says the god that made the world and all
[18:02] things therein seeing that he is Lord of
[18:05] Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples
[18:07] made with hands
[18:09] neither is worshiped with men's hands
[18:14] as though he needed anything
[18:18] seeing as he giveth to all life and
[18:20] breath
[18:21] and all things
[18:23] he talks of how they should seek the
[18:25] Lord if happily they might feel after
[18:28] him and find him though he be not far
[18:31] from every one of us
[18:34] let me
[18:36] come into His presence
[18:40] you know there is a call to enter his
[18:44] presence
[18:46] and a way has been ministered for each
[18:48] of us to do so
[18:52] it's not to get to that perfect worship
[18:54] service to get in his presence
[18:57] but it's a personal call to come into
[19:00] His presence
[19:03] it says Jeremiah 29 13 and ye shall seek
[19:06] me and find me when she when ye shall
[19:08] search for me with all your heart
[19:12] there's a provided way for us to enter
[19:14] into his presence and there's a call
[19:16] for us to come into His presence each
[19:18] and every day
[19:22] to Avail ourselves of the way that's
[19:24] been provided
[19:27] verse 7 for he is our God
[19:30] not the god of the group he is my God
[19:35] and we are the people I am one of the
[19:38] people of his pasture
[19:41] not my pastor
[19:43] not my placing not my positioning
[19:47] but I am the person of his pasture the
[19:49] pasture where he's placed us
[19:53] and the Sheep of his hand today if you
[19:56] will hear his voice
[19:58] just remember John 10 you know my sheep
[20:01] hear my voice and a stranger they will
[20:03] not follow
[20:05] am I listening for his voice
[20:08] each and every day
[20:13] my
[20:14] tuning out all the other voices of the
[20:17] land
[20:18] and seeking his voice
[20:21] you know as we read this chapter as I
[20:24] was reading this chapter and looking at
[20:25] it from that lens not as a call to
[20:28] worship as part of a church service but
[20:30] as an individual interaction
[20:33] each and every day
[20:36] the thing he has called each of us to
[20:39] if we will it changes the passage it
[20:44] becomes an intimate call to his presence
[20:47] and to sing the song he's given for us
[20:50] to sing
[20:52] anyway that was
[20:53] what he spoke to me about I want to go
[20:56] ahead and stand we're going to read
[20:57] Psalm 95 together
[21:04] foreign
[21:06] starting in verse one O come let us sing
[21:09] unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise
[21:12] to the rock of our Salvation let us come
[21:15] before his presence with Thanksgiving
[21:17] and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with
[21:19] Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a
[21:23] great king above all gods in his hand
[21:25] are the Deep places of the Earth the
[21:28] strength of the hills is his also the
[21:30] sea is his and he made it and His Hands
[21:33] formed the dry land O come let us
[21:36] worship and bow down let us kneel before
[21:39] the Lord our maker for he is our God and
[21:42] we are the people of his pasture and the
[21:45] Sheep of his hand today if ye will hear
[21:48] his voice Harden not your heart as in
[21:51] the provocation as in the day of
[21:53] Temptation in the wilderness when your
[21:55] fathers tempted me proved me and saw my
[21:59] work 40 years long was I grieved with
[22:02] this generation and said it is a people
[22:04] that do air in their heart and they have
[22:07] not known my ways unto whom I swear in
[22:10] my wrath that they should not enter into
[22:13] my rest amen
[22:16] hey man you may be seated
[22:20] and that's what we want to do this
[22:21] morning come into His presence with

[35:18] I've been real hesitant to do this for a
[35:21] long time and uh
[35:24] you know the Lord's been really putting
[35:27] it on my heart and when Davey came up
[35:29] here
[35:30] it really encouraged me uh
[35:34] but I told Brother Billy I guess it's
[35:37] probably been maybe a couple of years
[35:39] ago
[35:41] that it was on my heart to do it but
[35:43] also I wanted to read something and uh
[35:48] brother Mike
[35:49] just uh the psalm reading just went so
[35:53] well with what
[35:55] um I've been reading
[35:57] and what's been really encouraging me
[36:05] let's see if I can find her here
[36:08] it's from what hears thou Elijah
[36:17] it's
[36:19] at 29 if they want to put it up on the
[36:23] screen
[36:24] let me see
[36:32] so it says now I want you to notice no
[36:36] no no yeah now I want you to notice what
[36:39] taking place and it it isn't always
[36:41] noisy things
[36:42] that's great things
[36:45] it's the noisy things
[36:47] it's not the noisy things well wait a
[36:50] minute that's not
[36:53] losing my place here just bear with me

[37:38] taking place it isn't always the noisy
[37:40] things that's the great things it's not
[37:43] the noise it's not the noisy things a
[37:46] wagon couldn't go out in the field when
[37:48] it's when it's unloaded it it'll bump
[37:51] and Rattle and make a lot of noise
[37:54] can come right back over the same bumps
[37:57] loaded with good things
[37:59] and won't even make a squeak
[38:02] why it's loaded
[38:04] while the church needs tonight it's to
[38:07] be loaded filled with the love of God
[38:09] the son can draw a million gallons of
[38:12] water with less noise than we can pump a
[38:16] glass of full water
[38:18] that's right the heavens can sprinkle
[38:21] Dew all over the Earth with less noise
[38:23] then you can sprinkle your front lawn
[38:26] certainly did certain certainly did you
[38:30] ever hear the planet turning great
[38:33] things are Quiet Things watch the Holy
[38:35] Spirit when it comes in tonight how
[38:37] quiet it gets everything
[38:40] but we're after Sensations running after
[38:43] little things failing to hear that voice
[38:46] did you ever hear the Daybreak no you
[38:49] never heard the Daybreak yet it
[38:51] scattered all the darkness
[38:54] if we would only listen to the voice of
[38:56] him that speaks Behind these things
[38:58] there would be Fellowship amongst all
[39:01] the churches Methodist Baptist
[39:03] Protestant Protestant Catholic and all
[39:06] together would tear down the middle wall
[39:08] of partitions
[39:10] and we'd have brotherly love
[39:13] you know it and it goes on and on but it
[39:16] just it really quickens something to me
[39:19] you know and I and even we've been in
[39:22] the
[39:23] in the someranian church age in the
[39:25] Bible study at Matthews and just held
[39:28] tests and trials are really
[39:30] they're special even though sometimes we
[39:33] think we're going through a hard time
[39:34] and we're thinking that God forgot about
[39:37] us he's allowing it for a purpose and I
[39:40] never really it took me a while to
[39:43] realize that and and when God put
[39:46] something on my heart I want to move
[39:48] forward and uh I've ran from this for a
[39:52] while so but you're gonna have to put
[39:55] the words up because I don't remember
[39:56] the words it's God is so good
[40:01] and if y'all can sing with me because
[40:04] I'm not a singer and I'm very nervous
[40:11] and gone
[40:14] is so good
[40:21] is so good
[40:25] God
[40:27] is so good

[45:04] depression we pray that he comes to us
[45:07] to on the scene and touch our heart in
[45:10] the spirit thank you amen amen I believe
[45:12] we bring this request before the Lord
[45:14] because we know he's here to do that
[45:15] amen that's the purpose for the word if
[45:18] it's not for healing if it's not for
[45:20] deliverance then what is it for it's to
[45:22] bring us into that perfect condition and
[45:25] we have to come with confidence knowing
[45:27] that God will do these things but if

[46:01] presence and ask for this and know that
[46:03] he will hear our prayers I want to
[46:05] continue to pray for the the church
[46:08] constructions and amen and the needs

[46:18] Lord the brothers that are taking the
[46:19] offerings if you can come amen
[46:25] [Music]
[46:31] [Music]
[46:33] you know if we all could just think
[46:35] personally about each one of these tests
[46:37] there's requests for prayer because
[46:39] there's power in your prayer and if you
[46:42] can take to heart I know sometimes it's
[46:44] hard to remember I can't even hardly
[46:46] remember all the requests but sometimes
[46:48] just one of those requests strikes your
[46:50] heart and let the love of God that what
[46:53] God did for you how you can identify
[46:55] with that hurting individual that person
[46:58] you know I know there's some that you
[47:00] know experience the liver transplant
[47:02] that person can really bear the burden
[47:04] we want our prayers and our faith to go
[47:06] out to these needs and and to know that
[47:09] we can touch God because he's touched by
[47:11] the feeling of our infirmities and right
[47:14] now the the very needs this some of it
[47:17] doesn't seem between life and death but
[47:18] if the truth of God's word can come upon
[47:21] that situation and they can see this was
[47:24] actually used to bring me into his
[47:26] presence to to know that that God is so
[47:28] mindful even now to them and to bring
[47:32] them to a healing virtue or or a
[47:34] Providence or something let's Bear Let's
[47:37] bear our burdens with these requests and
[47:39] just really enter in and just trust that
[47:41] the Lord will undertake for these you
[47:43] believe God's going to do that by your
[47:45] prayer
[47:46] make these requests known pour out your
[47:50] the voice that you had let it be known

[53:07] taking place
[53:08] so you have a Mountaintop experience and
[53:12] then you you think you're going to stay
[53:13] there but it's right after the
[53:15] Mountaintop experience you go in the
[53:16] valley and when you're in the valley
[53:19] the devil makes you think that there's
[53:21] no way out there's no hope that it's the
[53:23] wrath of God on you but the reality is
[53:25] there's a Perfection he's trying to
[53:26] create a character that he wants to
[53:28] bring out in the midst of the trial in
[53:31] the midst of the problem and just
[53:33] studying at the men's meeting about the
[53:35] age of Marion like brother Tommy was
[53:37] talking about that christ-like character
[53:39] in the midst of suffering it was
[53:41] something something that was said uh in
[53:44] that book the expression of the church
[53:45] ages and it was something along the
[53:47] lines of
[53:50] God could easily at the snap of his
[53:53] finger and all your suffering he knows
[53:55] you're suffering he knows you're in
[53:57] Trials but he can't hear you he's not
[53:59] going to do that he's got to get you
[54:01] through it when you see his hand guiding
[54:04] you through it it means more to you than
[54:06] an instant gratification an instant
[54:08] blessing so I want to sing this song
[54:09] Just To Praise Him in the midst of the
[54:12] storm in the midst of everything

[1:03:30] uncomprehendable
[1:03:32] Lord that you would even consider such
[1:03:35] as us
[1:03:37] but yet you so loved us you gave your
[1:03:39] only begotten son
[1:03:42] father he laid his life down for us
[1:03:46] and father then you said if we would
[1:03:48] believe on him and take his name that
[1:03:50] you would give us power to become the
[1:03:52] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:54] Lord oh we magnify your name this
[1:03:58] morning we ask you to bless us in your
[1:04:02] precious and holy name we pray
[1:04:05] man
[1:04:07] God bless you this morning you may be
[1:04:09] seated
[1:04:12] certainly uh
[1:04:15] nice to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:04:18] morning I I see that we acknowledge
[1:04:20] sister Linda nakubi's birthday it's also
[1:04:23] Marie tomomo's birthday today so if we
[1:04:26] wish her happy birthday
[1:04:28] sister Nikki Oglesby if you're
[1:04:31] listening this morning sister Nikki
[1:04:33] happy birthday to you and
[1:04:36] Jonathan sends you his birthday
[1:04:38] greetings from Chicago
[1:04:40] and it was a brother Jonathan's birthday
[1:04:42] yesterday amen I I certainly uh
[1:04:47] felt for brother Ben this morning when
[1:04:50] he said it's been the last couple weeks
[1:04:54] have been real difficult and everything
[1:04:56] well he's been working for me for the
[1:04:59] last time
[1:05:01] we certainly know what that's like
[1:05:05] you know I I just don't know why God
[1:05:08] made me such a Taskmaster but I do know
[1:05:12] that uh there's great Deliverance after
[1:05:15] the hand of the Taskmaster so we're
[1:05:18] certainly grateful for that
[1:05:20] um but anyway we we certainly love the
[1:05:24] Lord especially nice to have my brother
[1:05:26] with us this morning we'll be hearing
[1:05:28] from him here in just a moment uh
[1:05:31] brother Mike could you put up uh
[1:05:34] I believe it's uh uh Luke 6 31 on the
[1:05:40] board Luke 6
[1:05:46] on the board
[1:05:48] how many knows what this is called what
[1:05:51] the common terminology for this saying
[1:05:54] is
[1:05:55] the Golden Rule
[1:05:58] and you know it's a great it's a great
[1:06:01] uh
[1:06:02] when they say it's a golden rule another
[1:06:05] if if we could follow this
[1:06:08] how many things would uh fall in place
[1:06:12] you know in First Corinthians up 1134
[1:06:17] uh Paul says he says if any hunger let
[1:06:21] him eat at home he says and the rest
[1:06:23] will I set an order when I come
[1:06:27] and then also in uh
[1:06:29] First Corinthians 14 41 he makes this
[1:06:34] statement he says let all things be done
[1:06:37] decently and in order
[1:06:40] if and those great scriptures really
[1:06:43] fall under the Golden Rule if is do
[1:06:47] other things so when you begin to follow
[1:06:50] that there's a few little things I'd
[1:06:52] like to go over with us this morning
[1:06:54] before our brother ministers to us but
[1:06:57] just little things that start to creep
[1:07:00] in
[1:07:01] and you find out
[1:07:03] that they don't appear so bad within
[1:07:05] themselves
[1:07:07] but they stand in opposition of the
[1:07:10] golden rule or of doing unto others so
[1:07:14] one of the things is like cell phones
[1:07:17] cell phone usage in the church
[1:07:20] and normally we'd like you to turn off
[1:07:23] your cell phones and put them away
[1:07:24] before you come to church but you know
[1:07:27] for a lot of you young sisters that have
[1:07:29] got into this be real
[1:07:32] and then you start taking pictures of
[1:07:34] one another in church and posting them
[1:07:37] online
[1:07:38] you know and I just want you to picture
[1:07:42] yourself at your wedding
[1:07:45] you know and you're you're standing up
[1:07:48] there at your wedding and you're about
[1:07:50] to give your vows it's your great day in
[1:07:55] church and somebody's around going
[1:08:00] you know total disregard
[1:08:04] for your day
[1:08:06] you know and I know these things become
[1:08:09] fads but but you you don't want to do
[1:08:12] that and and how about shopping on
[1:08:14] Amazon
[1:08:18] can you imagine
[1:08:20] at your wedding or your day
[1:08:23] at and the people in church are shopping
[1:08:27] on Amazon
[1:08:31] now you know the scripture says it just
[1:08:34] takes a little leaven
[1:08:37] to leaven the whole lot
[1:08:40] I mean just just that one moment you got
[1:08:43] bored or you got a flash in your mind
[1:08:46] that you could buy a dress if you didn't
[1:08:48] buy it by noon you know what I mean so
[1:08:50] you think you'll just pull out your
[1:08:52] phone and quickly flash in the order on
[1:08:55] Amazon you just got to remember there's
[1:08:58] a great God
[1:08:59] that's looking at the whole picture
[1:09:02] and when he he sees those things and I
[1:09:07] know they don't mean much to you and we
[1:09:09] all talk about our teenage years and and
[1:09:12] how boring church is and and all those
[1:09:15] things and you suffer through it but you
[1:09:18] know if you could just hang in there for
[1:09:19] a few hours and and just and just be
[1:09:24] mindful that there are other people here
[1:09:27] who really want to Worship the Lord
[1:09:30] and there are people here that God's
[1:09:32] really done a lot for
[1:09:34] you know I mean like brother Tommy I I
[1:09:37] appreciate that this morning because if
[1:09:40] you got something on your heart
[1:09:42] do it
[1:09:44] because it opens a whole nother Avenue
[1:09:47] of things that's that one thing you're
[1:09:50] holding back from doing maybe holding
[1:09:53] back a a fountain of blessing coming
[1:09:57] your way and I really appreciate it
[1:09:59] because I know where Tommy come from and
[1:10:01] every word that he speaks is genuine and
[1:10:05] so that means so much for me so these
[1:10:08] are little things that we just need to
[1:10:10] put under that great Golden Rule in
[1:10:13] other words an after service I know that
[1:10:16] we're trying to build a better facility
[1:10:18] for us but we just got to move out of
[1:10:22] the four-year
[1:10:23] after service
[1:10:25] when we're done don't stop and talk in
[1:10:27] the foyer temporarily you can go into
[1:10:30] the other building over here if you need
[1:10:33] to I know it's hot but if we could just
[1:10:36] empty out the foyer as quick as possible
[1:10:39] and uh
[1:10:41] and uh not stop and visit in the foyer
[1:10:44] so when you leave the church just make
[1:10:46] your way right outside the best you can
[1:10:49] and and we will do that and we're
[1:10:52] working as hard as we can to prepare uh
[1:10:56] better places for you in the next couple
[1:10:58] weeks it'll be even better so we want to
[1:11:01] do that
[1:11:02] and then also it's real important to
[1:11:06] keep the
[1:11:08] the sanctuary reverent and and as
[1:11:14] people are praying
[1:11:16] sometimes we'll have people at the altar
[1:11:19] and people especially our musicians have
[1:11:22] to be careful when you come off the uh
[1:11:24] altar if somebody's praying that you you
[1:11:27] don't step over them or you don't you
[1:11:30] know you you do that so we want to keep
[1:11:32] the sanctuary real reverent as possible
[1:11:34] tell everybody's finished praying and
[1:11:38] what happens a lot of times somebody
[1:11:40] will be in here praying or even in the
[1:11:42] back room praying and then we have a
[1:11:45] fellowship meeting going on in the four
[1:11:47] year
[1:11:48] and uh
[1:11:50] and I think what we fail to understand
[1:11:52] is the long-term effect
[1:11:54] of the little foxes that spoiled the
[1:11:58] vine so I think we need to pull
[1:12:00] ourselves back together start getting
[1:12:03] back to the main thing here which is to
[1:12:06] Worship the Lord Jesus to keep him
[1:12:08] number one to keep the house of the Lord
[1:12:11] reverent
[1:12:12] I'm glad you love one another and you
[1:12:15] have great social lives but let's move
[1:12:17] them to the outside and then sisters
[1:12:20] after foot washing we just like you to
[1:12:23] go ahead and stay in the room together
[1:12:25] till everybody's finished we're starting
[1:12:29] to get a few sisters that come out and
[1:12:31] congregate in the fellowship area there
[1:12:35] and talk and and uh and so now you don't
[1:12:39] have to stay uh tell the worship if
[1:12:43] you're done with communion and foot
[1:12:44] washing a few more than welcome to go to
[1:12:48] your home if you would like you don't
[1:12:51] have to stay for the uh worship after
[1:12:55] the singing afterwards so you when
[1:12:57] you're done washing feet we've completed
[1:13:00] communion and foot washing and you feel
[1:13:02] feel free to go at any time but uh let's
[1:13:07] just try to do a few little of those
[1:13:09] things and I think it'll make everything
[1:13:11] better for us amen I want to spiritually
[1:13:15] grow don't you
[1:13:16] amen I think that's uh that's a a
[1:13:20] wonderful thing to do is is to
[1:13:24] spiritually uh
[1:13:26] grow and it takes all of us to grow
[1:13:29] together
[1:13:30] so let's keep that in mind and so it's
[1:13:33] not the law that we're in putting it's
[1:13:37] the Golden Rule right do unto others as
[1:13:40] you have them do unto you if you were
[1:13:43] praying wouldn't you want someone to be
[1:13:45] quiet
[1:13:46] if you are in need wouldn't you want
[1:13:49] someone to be reverent so if we do these
[1:13:51] things I think that it's really
[1:13:53] wonderful amen it's nice to have my
[1:13:56] brother with me Dennis come here my good
[1:13:58] brother
[1:14:02] this is my brother I've been lying about
[1:14:05] for a long time I tell everybody he's my
[1:14:08] older brother
[1:14:10] most people believe me so uh but anyways
[1:14:14] nice to have him he reminds me more of
[1:14:17] my dad he's like my dad than all of us I
[1:14:21] call him Little Mac
[1:14:22] but anyway so it's been a blessing many
[1:14:25] of you have heard the story when he
[1:14:28] first came to see me in Montana and I
[1:14:30] told him about the message he uh
[1:14:33] so he went to wonder if what I was
[1:14:36] talking about that was the truth he was
[1:14:39] raised a Catholic like I was all his
[1:14:41] life and wasn't really introduced uh to
[1:14:45] the Lord as most Catholics aren't we
[1:14:47] disbelieve in the church and being a
[1:14:51] part of the church is on her way so he
[1:14:53] wanted to find out if this message was
[1:14:57] true or not
[1:14:59] so he knelt down before the Lord with a
[1:15:02] sincere heart and he said Lord if
[1:15:07] if this message be true and what my
[1:15:10] brother's talking about is real
[1:15:13] let a a tree uh
[1:15:17] Branch or limb or let a tree fall on his
[1:15:20] pickup truck
[1:15:24] I sure glad he's matured in his prayers
[1:15:29] so I'm in the woods
[1:15:34] I was a lumberjack I Saw Timber in
[1:15:37] Montana for a living
[1:15:39] and I come to a tree and this tree is
[1:15:42] what we call an easy fall
[1:15:45] it's leaning one place like this if
[1:15:48] there's nothing out in front of it it's
[1:15:50] an easy fall you just put your notch in
[1:15:52] you cut it you follow it you Buck it up
[1:15:55] and so I come down the road I park my
[1:15:58] truck back here like this and the trees
[1:16:01] over here leaning this way easy fall
[1:16:04] I cut that tree and I cut that tree and
[1:16:07] that tree goes off of that stump
[1:16:09] and out of the middle of nowhere
[1:16:12] a wind comes down
[1:16:14] and picks that tree up
[1:16:16] and I'm watching this tree go up in the
[1:16:19] air like this and I am not believing
[1:16:22] what I'm seeing and this tree falls
[1:16:25] right across my pickup truck
[1:16:29] and Smashes in
[1:16:32] and I think my goodness
[1:16:36] what did I do
[1:16:39] you know I just couldn't I couldn't
[1:16:41] comprehend that
[1:16:43] but anyway I I never could figure it out
[1:16:46] until uh my brother called me and said
[1:16:49] man I prayed that if this message be
[1:16:51] true you probably had to try well let me
[1:16:54] tell you the message is true and and
[1:16:58] he's here this morning too uh uh testify
[1:17:03] to that to you my brother does a lot of
[1:17:06] missionary work a lot of work for
[1:17:08] spreading this message and it's a real
[1:17:10] honor and privilege this morning to have
[1:17:14] you got introduce to you my little
[1:17:17] brother Dennis he's 10 years younger
[1:17:19] than I am but he's worked so hard in the
[1:17:22] gospel it hardly looks that way anymore
[1:17:25] but we love him with all our heart and
[1:17:28] we like even welcome him this morning my
[1:17:30] brother Dennis McGary God bless you
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:36] I greet you in the name of the Lord I
[1:17:38] wonder if the musicians would just stay
[1:17:40] a minute I was so much enjoying that
[1:17:42] song come let us Worship the Lord
[1:17:45] together how's that go you know what we
[1:17:48] were singing
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:59] just happy in the Lord
[1:18:04] very encouraged day got to be with the
[1:18:07] young man
[1:18:09] I will study the other morning and that
[1:18:10] encouraged me well what really
[1:18:13] encouraging me is that I got to meet
[1:18:16] some of the
[1:18:17] older brothers and sisters and see that
[1:18:20] was very impressed with the joy of the
[1:18:24] Lord
[1:18:24] and I pray
[1:18:27] brother Brown said don't let my life be
[1:18:30] crowned with grumpiness
[1:18:33] something like that he said
[1:18:35] I saw them and I thought in the midst of
[1:18:38] all the onslaught of Affliction just
[1:18:42] that joy of the Lord it really
[1:18:44] encouraged me that that uh
[1:18:47] I may have some real good years if the
[1:18:50] Lord carries I might could have some
[1:18:52] real good years in front of me to do
[1:18:55] something for the Lord
[1:18:57] and I'm happy to be here this morning
[1:19:00] with you
[1:19:01] and uh
[1:19:04] just when we were going out the door
[1:19:07] My Brother David said well if you want
[1:19:09] to say something about Bulgarian
[1:19:13] I hadn't intended to because it's church
[1:19:17] for you all and you're looking to the
[1:19:19] word of the Lord but let me just say
[1:19:22] three names to you and if you could
[1:19:24] remember those names and pray pray for
[1:19:26] these three people they're working on
[1:19:29] the translation work and it's just New
[1:19:32] Beginnings in Bulgaria so
[1:19:36] you can't believe it if it's not in your
[1:19:38] language and so they're working to get
[1:19:40] this message in the language of the
[1:19:43] people and its three sisters and one of
[1:19:46] the sisters names is Ava
[1:19:48] and one is Jenny
[1:19:52] and one is Desi Slava or you could say
[1:19:55] Desi so Desi Jenny and Ava
[1:20:00] and they're trying
[1:20:02] to do the best they can
[1:20:05] to get it like God gave it in English to
[1:20:08] their people
[1:20:09] so if you just remember Bulgaria maybe
[1:20:12] you could find it on the map and pray
[1:20:14] for those people they don't have what we
[1:20:17] have and so if you do that uh
[1:20:21] we certainly appreciate I'm sure it'd be
[1:20:24] a great blessing to the children of God
[1:20:27] that haven't heard yet
[1:20:30] let's sing that song together maybe
[1:20:32] could you want to stand again and sing
[1:20:34] with me and

[1:23:52] and our hunger and our thirst to you now
[1:23:57] in Jesus name we ask you to bless your
[1:24:00] word
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:03] amen if you like to remain standing for
[1:24:05] just a moment and
[1:24:07] I'd like to
[1:24:11] read out of the book of Isaiah
[1:24:16] and the
[1:24:19] ninth chapter
[1:24:29] and this is a verse Maybe
[1:24:33] often
[1:24:35] brought around Christmas time
[1:24:39] it's a very beautiful scripture and
[1:24:42] Isaiah chapter 9 and the sixth verse
[1:24:48] For unto us
[1:24:50] a child is born
[1:24:52] unto us
[1:24:54] a son is given
[1:24:57] the government
[1:24:58] shall be upon his shoulder
[1:25:01] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:25:05] counselor
[1:25:07] the Mighty God
[1:25:08] the Everlasting father
[1:25:11] the Prince of Peace
[1:25:14] of the increase of his government
[1:25:17] and peace
[1:25:19] there shall be
[1:25:21] no end
[1:25:24] upon the throne of David and upon his
[1:25:26] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[1:25:29] with judgment and with Justice from
[1:25:32] henceforth
[1:25:33] even forever
[1:25:36] the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[1:25:40] perform this
[1:25:42] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:25:46] if the Lord had helped us this morning
[1:25:48] I'd like to speak about the government
[1:25:50] of the church
[1:25:53] and this is not a business meeting this
[1:25:55] morning
[1:25:58] but
[1:26:00] when we
[1:26:01] think about government and and what we
[1:26:05] are expecting leadership from
[1:26:10] and how we're going to face the
[1:26:14] challenges
[1:26:16] in our life
[1:26:19] uh
[1:26:22] brother Branham
[1:26:26] made this statement and I
[1:26:29] thought how striking it is
[1:26:34] he said as I was
[1:26:37] remarking some time ago about a certain
[1:26:39] little Canary
[1:26:41] and he thought he knowed
[1:26:44] all the knowledge that that needed to be
[1:26:47] node
[1:26:48] and he knowed so much that he could tell
[1:26:51] all the rest of the canaries about human
[1:26:53] beings
[1:26:55] so he flies up on his cage and he begins
[1:26:58] to speak about the human being
[1:27:00] how he knowed all about them
[1:27:04] and all of a sudden a professor from
[1:27:06] Purdue walked Walked up and began to
[1:27:08] speak some high polished words to him
[1:27:12] and the little fellow batted his eyes
[1:27:14] and turned his head
[1:27:16] now he had eyes
[1:27:19] he could see the professor
[1:27:22] he had ears he could hear him
[1:27:25] but of course he didn't know what he was
[1:27:28] talking about
[1:27:30] why
[1:27:31] he's got a canary brain
[1:27:34] he's just a bird brain
[1:27:37] that's all he's got
[1:27:40] he hasn't got a human brain so he can't
[1:27:43] think like human beings
[1:27:49] and neither can a human being think like
[1:27:53] God
[1:27:55] you're human
[1:27:57] and all the worldly knowledge is no more
[1:28:01] than a canary brain
[1:28:05] all you do
[1:28:07] you just hurt yourself with it
[1:28:12] you've got to have the mind of Christ
[1:28:16] I believe that's what we're all looking
[1:28:18] for this morning is the help of the Lord
[1:28:22] the
[1:28:23] human mind's a wonderful thing it's the
[1:28:25] womb to the soul and it's marvelous to
[1:28:28] see what man can do he's a little
[1:28:31] Messiah
[1:28:32] and so we want to give our
[1:28:35] thoughts and our our mind over to the
[1:28:38] Lord scripture says that the thought of
[1:28:41] foolishness is sin
[1:28:44] so God help us this morning to look into
[1:28:47] the word of God and may the Lord help
[1:28:50] our little
[1:28:51] Canary brains
[1:28:54] and anoint them and and and let us put
[1:28:57] on the mind of Christ so that this
[1:29:00] wonderful mind of ours that can can
[1:29:05] uh
[1:29:06] absorb and see the pictures that God is
[1:29:10] giving us the he wrote the Book of
[1:29:12] Revelation in symbols and he and he
[1:29:15] writes his love letter to his church
[1:29:18] between the lines and our minds are very
[1:29:22] wonderfully made to catch the concept of
[1:29:27] God the the word of God and what God is
[1:29:31] trying to express to his children that
[1:29:34] he loved that he wanted a family he
[1:29:37] could be almighty God and rule over the
[1:29:40] universe he's the great Creator but he
[1:29:43] desired more than rulership he wanted a
[1:29:47] love affair
[1:29:49] and and he gave you the mind that you
[1:29:53] have to to hear his word and and by his
[1:29:58] grace and by his quickening power and by
[1:30:01] the anointing that he sends to your
[1:30:04] heart he he
[1:30:07] fellowships and communes with you
[1:30:10] and it's a it's very interesting to be
[1:30:13] in foreign countries and to see in other
[1:30:15] languages they don't use these words the
[1:30:18] and ah and this and that but sometimes
[1:30:22] they put them on the end of the word so
[1:30:25] the word has the the what we call I
[1:30:29] think definite articles my brother could
[1:30:31] maybe correct me on some of this English
[1:30:33] but we put the definite article in front
[1:30:36] of the word but they build it into the
[1:30:37] word and so sometimes when you're trying
[1:30:40] to preach there you're talking about
[1:30:43] when we speak of the government and what
[1:30:46] a grand Liberty it is just to not have
[1:30:49] to
[1:30:50] have translation
[1:30:53] but if you think about the government
[1:30:55] and you think about an institution and
[1:30:59] and in your mind it's kind of a noun to
[1:31:02] you and you say the government you know
[1:31:04] the U.S government the the the local
[1:31:08] government and and it's it's kind of an
[1:31:10] institution to you
[1:31:13] and sometimes these Concepts get so
[1:31:16] common in man that words even change
[1:31:20] their meaning because Society has
[1:31:23] changed the original meaning of the word
[1:31:26] so for an example of that in England
[1:31:28] when they were translating the Bible
[1:31:31] when the in the New Testament when the
[1:31:34] Bible said the church the people had
[1:31:37] been under that Roman domination for so
[1:31:41] long that even the phrase the church
[1:31:44] meant Rome meant the hierarchy at Rome
[1:31:48] and so when they said the church so
[1:31:50] that's why you have these churches I
[1:31:52] don't know if any of you have seen them
[1:31:54] but they're called congregational and
[1:31:56] that came out of England because they
[1:31:59] wanted to change the word from church to
[1:32:02] the congregation to the people because
[1:32:05] that was so much in the mind when they
[1:32:07] said the church
[1:32:08] so this morning when we talk about the
[1:32:12] government we're not talking about a
[1:32:15] noun or an institution we're talking
[1:32:17] about a verb that someone is governing
[1:32:22] the the action of governing the church
[1:32:28] and the church
[1:32:30] is not this church but it's his
[1:32:35] church I mean not this church the
[1:32:38] building the organization organism you
[1:32:41] know well whatever we're building over
[1:32:43] there uh it is his bride
[1:32:48] it's me because I'm his choice and if
[1:32:52] I'm a believer I'm not afraid to say
[1:32:55] that it's me because I'm a believer I'm
[1:32:58] believing just that I'm believing his
[1:33:00] word
[1:33:01] so when we talk about
[1:33:04] his government
[1:33:06] there were certain things that God put
[1:33:08] in place
[1:33:10] temporarily
[1:33:12] and when Jesus came the scribes and the
[1:33:15] Pharisees
[1:33:18] when they heard him speaking and
[1:33:21] preaching
[1:33:22] it it brought some conflict and some
[1:33:24] controversies and they thought well if
[1:33:27] that be so what about this
[1:33:30] and we always have that as Believers
[1:33:33] when the word of God comes to us we get
[1:33:36] very challenged in our thinking
[1:33:38] sometimes whether we're raised in church
[1:33:40] or we come off the street when the word
[1:33:42] of God starts to be quickened to you
[1:33:45] there's this contradiction and there's
[1:33:48] this questioning like you know do I have
[1:33:51] this right and so the scribes and the
[1:33:54] Pharisees they said to Jesus they said
[1:33:56] we're we're not understanding here why
[1:34:00] did Moses then if what you're saying is
[1:34:02] true why did Moses give a law of
[1:34:05] divorcement
[1:34:07] because God doesn't God hates divorce
[1:34:10] and and he's making a choice when he
[1:34:12] chose you that's forever you were in his
[1:34:16] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:34:17] world he wanted a bride he wasn't
[1:34:19] thinking well I'm going to have a bride
[1:34:21] for a while no that that wasn't God's
[1:34:24] thought so they asked Jesus they said
[1:34:27] why did Moses give give this law of
[1:34:30] divorcement and Jesus said because of
[1:34:34] the hardness of your hearts but it
[1:34:39] wasn't so from the beginning
[1:34:42] and by the grace of God we heard the
[1:34:45] prophet tell us what the beginning was
[1:34:48] because we would have just been
[1:34:49] wondering we would have we would have
[1:34:51] thought okay from the beginning of the
[1:34:52] beginning of the church you know the
[1:34:54] beginning of the law we wouldn't have
[1:34:56] known but the prophet came and said no
[1:34:58] the beginning was back in the garden
[1:35:01] there was one man and one woman and all
[1:35:05] the beauty of a woman and all that
[1:35:08] freshness and all that femininity and
[1:35:12] all that life that's in her when she's
[1:35:14] married that is for one man
[1:35:17] it's not for every man on the street
[1:35:19] it's not any kind of a game but all that
[1:35:23] beauty that when she's married that's
[1:35:26] for one man
[1:35:30] and that's how it was in the beginning
[1:35:31] in the garden there was just one man and
[1:35:34] one woman and there was perfect peace
[1:35:37] perfect Tranquility perfect love there
[1:35:40] was no sickness no controversies you
[1:35:43] know no ugliness no no friction no no
[1:35:47] anything it was just uh
[1:35:51] both the
[1:35:53] feminine and the masculine were in Adam
[1:35:57] then God took that feminine spirit and
[1:36:01] separated
[1:36:03] the feminine part and took a rib from
[1:36:06] Adam and put the feminine part in a
[1:36:08] woman and left the masculine part in
[1:36:10] Adam and then those two were different
[1:36:13] ever since and God always put a
[1:36:16] difference
[1:36:18] and so that's why it was an abomination
[1:36:20] in the sight of God for a woman to wear
[1:36:22] a garment pertaining to a man it was
[1:36:25] because she was invading that male
[1:36:28] domain
[1:36:30] amen and these things start going
[1:36:33] seamlessly together in the scripture if
[1:36:36] you're willing to go along
[1:36:38] and God is not trying to affirm or
[1:36:44] declare or defend his rulership of his
[1:36:49] creation he's not interested in that
[1:36:51] he'll need to do that he's almighty God
[1:36:53] and he created the universe and we're
[1:36:56] sending these little uh
[1:36:59] what do they call those little ships
[1:37:01] that go out there in the uh
[1:37:05] satellite thank you they're having they
[1:37:07] send these little satellites out there
[1:37:08] and they're just washed out there in
[1:37:10] space they're taking these pictures and
[1:37:12] they're just seeing galaxies Beyond and
[1:37:15] Beyond and Beyond
[1:37:17] so it
[1:37:19] he's almighty God
[1:37:21] you don't have to you don't have to
[1:37:22] affirm his rulership but but he's he
[1:37:26] wants to unveil himself
[1:37:29] in this fellowship and so if we went
[1:37:33] back in the garden where Jesus made this
[1:37:36] reference to I believe it's uh
[1:37:40] Genesis the second chapter is it not
[1:37:46] where he says because you've done this
[1:37:51] you know God would come down in the cool
[1:37:53] of the evening and fellowship with Adam
[1:37:55] and Eve and they'd lay down together
[1:37:56] with the lion and the leopard and and
[1:38:00] there they were in this perfect union
[1:38:02] with God
[1:38:05] and then sin came in the picture
[1:38:08] so when sin came into picture thou it's
[1:38:12] after the beginning
[1:38:17] and he says because you've done this and
[1:38:19] he talks about the serpent and he talks
[1:38:22] about Adam but he says this to the woman
[1:38:24] he says Thou shalt bring forth children
[1:38:26] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:38:29] and he shall rule over thee we're living
[1:38:33] in such a world that these fundamental
[1:38:37] concepts in Christianity are really
[1:38:41] become a hard pill to swallow somebody
[1:38:43] says I can't believe you just said that
[1:38:46] well I didn't say it
[1:38:47] so don't look at me it I was just
[1:38:50] reading here now that's up to you to
[1:38:53] figure out about this Bible if it's
[1:38:55] really the word of God if it came from
[1:38:57] God if it was really translated right
[1:39:00] whatever but it's you you've come too
[1:39:02] late for me because something
[1:39:04] Supernatural happened in my life
[1:39:07] where when I started reading this word I
[1:39:11] knew it was him talking to my heart I
[1:39:14] didn't know this you know I was reading
[1:39:16] Jesus's sermons I was reading The Sermon
[1:39:19] on the Mount blessed are you that hunger
[1:39:21] and thirst and I said oh praise God
[1:39:23] that's what I want to hear Lord and he
[1:39:26] just kept talking to my heart and he
[1:39:28] kept talking to me and I started saying
[1:39:31] yes
[1:39:33] and I don't mean to be too uh sassafras
[1:39:36] to make myself too much at home but you
[1:39:38] know I I when I give my heart to the
[1:39:42] Lord I start reading my Bible a woman
[1:39:44] gave me I I like to give my testimony
[1:39:46] someday here
[1:39:48] and fix a few things my brothers about
[1:39:51] my my brother's version of My Testimony
[1:39:54] but maybe the Lord someday when it's a
[1:39:56] good time we can do that but
[1:40:00] this nurse gave me a a pair of pajamas
[1:40:04] and a Bible and I started reading that
[1:40:06] Bible and I started experience in
[1:40:08] Jesus's words that my he said my word is
[1:40:12] spirit and life and by reading my Bible
[1:40:15] I started seeing that I didn't know
[1:40:18] nothing about church I could say
[1:40:19] Catholic music That's a crazy idea of
[1:40:21] church and and
[1:40:23] started seeing by reading this Bible my
[1:40:27] life was changing I saw that Dynamic and
[1:40:30] I knew that it was him so I knew there's
[1:40:33] something Supernatural about this world
[1:40:34] word I didn't know a bunch about it but
[1:40:37] I knew that this was him and that's just
[1:40:41] you know that
[1:40:44] that's just the way it is
[1:40:47] that's just how I got here
[1:40:50] so
[1:40:52] here he is
[1:40:53] God's saying
[1:40:55] he shall rule
[1:40:58] over thee
[1:41:01] man
[1:41:02] that's rough
[1:41:04] especially in the condition that man is
[1:41:07] because brother Adam said a man's just a
[1:41:10] brute without Christ
[1:41:13] but
[1:41:15] God had no intention of staying there
[1:41:18] because he was going to get a people
[1:41:20] over to Ephesians 5. that's that's you
[1:41:25] know this was just the beginning but
[1:41:27] over in Ephesians 5 we don't have to
[1:41:29] turn there you're sure familiar with it
[1:41:31] he said he said husbands love your wives
[1:41:35] as Christ loved the church and even gave
[1:41:40] himself for their sanctification so
[1:41:44] there's a lot of difference between
[1:41:46] government
[1:41:48] and rulership
[1:41:50] when when the mighty Khan brother
[1:41:52] Branham said in the mighty conquer and
[1:41:53] he's talking about Napoleon and he's
[1:41:56] talking about how he conquered the world
[1:41:58] he was just a young man and some of you
[1:42:00] might know the details better but I
[1:42:02] think by 35 he had conquered the biggest
[1:42:05] part of Europe in the Mediterranean he
[1:42:07] had a great Kingdom he was really a
[1:42:10] conqueror and he was very ruthless
[1:42:14] and
[1:42:17] he dominated the
[1:42:20] all of Europe
[1:42:23] and he went forth and he conquered but
[1:42:27] when he finally met his Waterloo he
[1:42:30] himself was conquered by alcohol
[1:42:34] and he in itself went down in disgrace
[1:42:37] and everywhere he conquered he left
[1:42:40] bitterness
[1:42:42] and and sorrow and every conqueror
[1:42:45] that's been like that in these great
[1:42:47] kingdoms when they go out and Conquer
[1:42:49] they're they're killing Sons and
[1:42:52] Daughters they're they're having
[1:42:55] ruthless and Reckless destruction and
[1:42:58] destroying families and lives and and
[1:43:01] the labor of that people have built up
[1:43:03] for years they tear it down and there's
[1:43:06] nothing but heartache and sorrow in
[1:43:10] their path
[1:43:11] and then they rule because they
[1:43:15] conquered they rule
[1:43:20] but there was one might he conqueror who
[1:43:22] came
[1:43:24] and he not only conquered but he
[1:43:27] conquered sin
[1:43:29] and death and hell and the grave
[1:43:33] and what did he leave behind perfect
[1:43:36] peace and love and goodness and and and
[1:43:40] so when he conquered and how did he
[1:43:44] conquer
[1:43:45] he humbled himself he was he became one
[1:43:49] of us he was so interested in our
[1:43:52] relationship with him that he became one
[1:43:55] of us
[1:43:56] how can you hold a trinitarian
[1:43:59] three-person God and believe in the
[1:44:03] Kinsmen Redeemer it wasn't somebody else
[1:44:05] it was him he came down to be one of us
[1:44:10] to suffer the things that you suffer to
[1:44:13] be tempted in every way as you are
[1:44:16] tempted so he could know how you feel
[1:44:19] and he could be your attorney and your
[1:44:22] guide and your counselor because he
[1:44:24] knows how you feel and he's interested
[1:44:26] in every detail of your life brother
[1:44:30] Adam said David got to thinking that
[1:44:32] maybe he wasn't
[1:44:34] and the sword never left David's house
[1:44:37] from that time on and he said yes God's
[1:44:40] interested in every detail of your life
[1:44:45] amen so
[1:44:49] the question is
[1:44:51] what kind of government are you
[1:44:55] accepting
[1:44:57] I certainly don't want it to be Canary
[1:44:59] Canary brain government
[1:45:03] and if you're you know if you're
[1:45:05] self-willed and you know it better and
[1:45:08] and you know how to do well then you
[1:45:11] know long live canaryville
[1:45:16] you know press on let's all tweet tweet
[1:45:20] tweet tweet to each other forevermore
[1:45:23] canaryville
[1:45:25] well I didn't see that one coming
[1:45:27] but maybe there's something to that
[1:45:33] but you know
[1:45:34] Abigail was under a government
[1:45:43] all saints of God if if we would
[1:45:45] remember I know a lot of you speak
[1:45:47] several languages and you know I'm a
[1:45:50] little ignorant myself I I had to learn
[1:45:53] my wife's language in self-defense but
[1:45:56] uh
[1:46:00] but you know we were trying to talk
[1:46:02] about Abigail the other day in in the
[1:46:04] Bible it says that
[1:46:06] Abigail
[1:46:08] was of a beautiful countenance
[1:46:12] so what was beautiful about her she was
[1:46:14] a woman of good understanding
[1:46:16] and of beautiful countenance
[1:46:20] so countenances is is you know that's
[1:46:23] not that's not what you do with your
[1:46:25] eyebrows and how you paint your face or
[1:46:28] uh
[1:46:29] doorbells or earbells or whatever think
[1:46:32] brother Bradham said they were Satan
[1:46:33] stirrups the devil stirrups and now he
[1:46:36] said but uh anyway
[1:46:39] uh
[1:46:41] uh that's not what you put on the
[1:46:43] outside
[1:46:45] and you know I just don't believe that
[1:46:47] the big problem is you know Fashions and
[1:46:51] putting on and all this outside putting
[1:46:53] on but the question is is sis
[1:46:56] are you not confident in who you are
[1:46:59] really are are you not comfortable
[1:47:02] in your own skin
[1:47:04] so I I think you know I think we're all
[1:47:07] kind of tired of a long Litany of do's
[1:47:10] and don'ts and we just can't keep track
[1:47:12] of it anymore but but what but what's
[1:47:15] beautiful to see is someone who's secure
[1:47:18] in Christ they know who they are they
[1:47:22] don't have to put on a anything from a
[1:47:24] new car to a new suit to a New Dress to
[1:47:27] new makeup or whatever but they just
[1:47:29] know that they're beloved of the Lord
[1:47:33] and God made me who I am and my daughter
[1:47:36] has a little plaque up on her house it
[1:47:39] says when you come in the door it says
[1:47:41] just be yourself everybody else is taken
[1:47:46] that makes you feel right at home you
[1:47:48] think oh well all right I'm going to
[1:47:49] take off my shoes and head over to the
[1:47:51] refrigerator
[1:47:53] so but the the Bible says that Abigail
[1:47:59] was of a a beautiful countenance well
[1:48:02] the Bulgarian Bible it just sits and
[1:48:05] beautiful
[1:48:06] and miss the whole thing
[1:48:09] and then so you see and they look over
[1:48:12] at my Bible and they go wow you know
[1:48:15] they missed something
[1:48:16] but
[1:48:18] anyway Abigail was under this Nable and
[1:48:21] he was and he was uh selfish and greedy
[1:48:25] and and and and he was into politics and
[1:48:28] he was all he was wanting to watch his
[1:48:30] football games and he didn't know what
[1:48:32] the prophet of the Lord said the prophet
[1:48:34] of Lord had anointed David and he and he
[1:48:37] wasn't aware of that world but she was
[1:48:39] she knew that the prophet's words
[1:48:41] wouldn't fall to the ground and so she
[1:48:44] was doing something about it
[1:48:48] but finally God brought her under a
[1:48:51] different government because nabal when
[1:48:53] she heard how how generous she was he
[1:48:57] had a heart attack and that was the end
[1:48:59] of nabel
[1:49:01] didn't brother round say If you think
[1:49:03] you got a little uh complex with
[1:49:05] something he said go just the opposite
[1:49:06] he said if you're going to be in a
[1:49:08] little stingy just just go right the
[1:49:11] opposite direction
[1:49:13] hmm
[1:49:16] sorry about that one
[1:49:21] so
[1:49:24] when you travel
[1:49:27] so so Abigail's under new government
[1:49:29] sometimes when you travel they're asking
[1:49:31] about your government
[1:49:33] you know what's going on in politics
[1:49:35] over there what's going on with your
[1:49:36] government and then they always say our
[1:49:38] government is corrupt and I'm so tempted
[1:49:40] to say oh no not our government you know
[1:49:43] we're America you know
[1:49:45] God and Country it's not God in country
[1:49:49] I'm sorry to say these things in the
[1:49:50] great state of Texas but it never was
[1:49:52] God in country it's just God
[1:49:56] and we need to forget all of these
[1:49:58] nationalistic things all of these ethnic
[1:50:01] things how would you like brother
[1:50:02] McGarry to come here and talk about
[1:50:05] cloverleafs and good luck good good luck
[1:50:08] and and Irish whiskey
[1:50:11] you know all this ethnic stuff needs to
[1:50:13] go away we we need to come into Christ
[1:50:17] and leave the ethnic things behind and
[1:50:22] it doesn't matter if it's Bulgaria China
[1:50:24] or DFW
[1:50:33] so God
[1:50:37] is
[1:50:39] governing
[1:50:40] his church and that's the only
[1:50:43] government that is not corrupt
[1:50:47] where man is there's the corruption's
[1:50:50] just going to want to want to come in
[1:50:52] there and and then we just got to
[1:50:54] constantly pray it out
[1:50:57] and in construction we have this
[1:50:58] expression the the the devil is in the
[1:51:02] details
[1:51:03] and you know you get right down to the
[1:51:05] Fine points I'm sure it's applicable in
[1:51:07] many things and you know the devil's
[1:51:09] hiding in the details and I tell the
[1:51:11] translator as I said but you know he's
[1:51:12] going to have a hard time uh uh
[1:51:15] hiding in this word of God in this work
[1:51:18] that we're doing we're going to work the
[1:51:19] details out and we're going to pray and
[1:51:22] let the Holy Spirit Drive the devil out
[1:51:25] of the details
[1:51:27] but God is his government is not corrupt
[1:51:34] in fact it's the only place to find
[1:51:38] righteousness
[1:51:40] and if we go over to Revelations the
[1:51:43] third chapter
[1:51:45] and the seventh verse
[1:51:51] this is the
[1:51:53] church at Philadelphia
[1:51:56] and unto the angel of the church in
[1:51:59] Philadelphia right
[1:52:01] these things
[1:52:03] saith he
[1:52:05] that is Holy
[1:52:10] it's only one holy
[1:52:12] it's very beautiful if you go to this in
[1:52:14] the church age book and I'm sure where
[1:52:15] I'm going many of you have been before
[1:52:18] but
[1:52:19] uh
[1:52:20] sure don't hurt to go there again when
[1:52:23] it's when it's real nice
[1:52:28] these things
[1:52:30] saith he that is Holy
[1:52:32] and he that is true
[1:52:36] and he that hath the key
[1:52:40] of David
[1:52:41] he that openeth and no man shutteth and
[1:52:45] shutteth and no man openeth
[1:52:48] and it's really wonderful in your life
[1:52:52] when you can recognize that it's God who
[1:52:55] opens doors for you and it's God who
[1:52:58] closes doors for you
[1:53:00] and I remember a certain place I had a
[1:53:03] certain job and I came back after being
[1:53:05] gone and I went to the door and I I went
[1:53:08] to open the door and it was locked and I
[1:53:11] thought man I'm a principal character in
[1:53:14] this operation
[1:53:16] I'm I would be the one that was doing
[1:53:18] some of the maintenance if anybody
[1:53:19] changed the locks it should have been me
[1:53:21] I wonder what the problem was and I
[1:53:23] called up another man and I said hey did
[1:53:25] you guys change the locks while we're
[1:53:27] gone and he said no I was gonna wait and
[1:53:30] wondering if you were home I was going
[1:53:32] to call you and ask you if if you
[1:53:35] changed the locks
[1:53:37] so we called up another principle in the
[1:53:41] operation and they informed us that we
[1:53:44] don't have keys anymore
[1:53:46] to the very office that we're working in
[1:53:48] and that was pretty abrupt like okay
[1:53:51] that chapter in my life is over and I
[1:53:55] was all bent out of shape for a long
[1:53:57] time meditating that one time I'm
[1:53:59] preaching in Phoenix about brother
[1:54:00] Branham he's talking about this
[1:54:03] scripture and he says he's the one that
[1:54:06] opens and he's the one to shut and right
[1:54:08] in the middle of the sermon I'm going
[1:54:09] wow what is wrong with me why am I vexed
[1:54:13] over the situation it was God that
[1:54:16] locked that door he shut that chapter in
[1:54:19] my life he he had me move on to another
[1:54:21] place in life and he's the one that does
[1:54:24] those things man doesn't do that to you
[1:54:27] man is not in control you've given your
[1:54:30] life to God and God is governing in his
[1:54:34] church
[1:54:38] thank you
[1:54:40] and I think that many of us don't have a
[1:54:44] problem
[1:54:44] to accept
[1:54:47] the sovereignty of God
[1:54:51] in a measure
[1:54:52] and sometimes God will raise that bar of
[1:54:56] how much you're accepting his
[1:54:58] sovereignty
[1:54:59] and you think of course I get the
[1:55:01] picture he's almighty God he can do what
[1:55:04] he wants there's very beautiful pictures
[1:55:06] of it brother Branham said when because
[1:55:08] God's Sovereign his grace he can extend
[1:55:11] his grace to whom he wants now we might
[1:55:14] think well that sisters that that slow
[1:55:16] down now I you know I don't know if
[1:55:19] there's forgiveness for that but when
[1:55:21] God stretches out his hand of Grace he
[1:55:24] is Sovereign he don't have to ask nobody
[1:55:26] well should I extend Grace should I
[1:55:29] extend forgiveness and mercy he is
[1:55:31] Sovereign God in Sovereign he don't ask
[1:55:33] nobody he can do what he wants he can
[1:55:35] save the lowest he can he can redeem the
[1:55:39] orneryist
[1:55:41] he can he can bring back the most
[1:55:43] back-sliced slitus
[1:55:48] well if you fell in the mud it's not
[1:55:50] pretty you might be stuttering too but I
[1:55:52] fell a few times like that and I know
[1:55:54] that he can do it
[1:55:58] so he sovereign
[1:56:00] but the picture that God is showing here
[1:56:04] when he says that he openeth and no man
[1:56:07] shutteth and he shutteth and no man
[1:56:09] openeth because he's got the Key of
[1:56:12] David it isn't that kind of sovereignty
[1:56:14] it isn't that kind of rulership God is
[1:56:18] trying to express to us something via
[1:56:20] the revelation of the prophet of God for
[1:56:23] an hour he's going to go to these
[1:56:25] scriptures and show us something else
[1:56:26] that it's not rulership like you might
[1:56:29] think
[1:56:30] it's not the kind of sovereignty that
[1:56:33] you like you maybe have a picture of
[1:56:37] so brother Branham starts to talk about
[1:56:39] David
[1:56:41] and this great
[1:56:44] because the scripture says
[1:56:46] that he hath the Key of David
[1:56:49] and David was a mighty conqueror
[1:56:52] he was a warrior he beat down all the
[1:56:56] nations all around him so Israel could
[1:56:58] have peace
[1:57:00] and that's why he couldn't build the
[1:57:03] temple that he wanted to build because
[1:57:05] he was a bloody man
[1:57:07] and
[1:57:10] David
[1:57:12] overcame the enemies and established the
[1:57:15] people and he sat down as a king on the
[1:57:19] throne
[1:57:21] so he he had established Israel beat
[1:57:24] down the envy and now he's sitting on
[1:57:27] the throne
[1:57:35] and
[1:57:36] maybe I'll just walk through some of
[1:57:39] this I I know you all love your church
[1:57:41] age books you can find this in the
[1:57:43] Philadelphian age
[1:57:50] but you'd read in Revelations here and a
[1:57:52] lot of times we're just too easy
[1:57:54] we just we read something we don't know
[1:57:57] what it refers to and we don't go any
[1:58:00] farther than that but if you would go
[1:58:02] just over the margin say in your
[1:58:04] Scofield bible it would bring you to
[1:58:07] Isaiah 22 and 22 and that's where
[1:58:09] brother Branham brings us when he's
[1:58:11] referring to this scripture he brings us
[1:58:13] over to Isaiah 22 and 22 and if you have
[1:58:18] your Bibles and you like to turn with me
[1:58:20] let's go there
[1:58:23] and I'm I realized this could be an old
[1:58:25] lesson to a lot of you I'm I'm sure
[1:58:29] many would like would have loved or did
[1:58:33] uh preach on this subject
[1:58:36] as brother Branham did
[1:58:40] Isaiah 22 22
[1:58:44] and look at how similar it is to this
[1:58:47] scripture in Revelations 3 and 7.
[1:58:54] let's just read 21 to kind of lead you
[1:58:57] into it and I will clothe him with the
[1:58:58] robe and strengthen him with thy girdle
[1:59:01] and I will commit thy government into
[1:59:04] his hand and he shall be a father to the
[1:59:07] inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the
[1:59:09] house of Judah
[1:59:10] and the key of the House of David will I
[1:59:15] lay upon his shoulder
[1:59:19] so he shall open and None Shall shut he
[1:59:23] shall shut and None Shall open
[1:59:32] so brother random asked the question
[1:59:35] what does the key
[1:59:37] signify
[1:59:39] and he says the answer lies in the
[1:59:42] position of the key
[1:59:44] it's not in his hand
[1:59:47] it's not around his neck it's not in any
[1:59:49] other person's hand but it's on his
[1:59:52] shoulder so we read that in Isaiah 9 and
[1:59:55] 6 that the government shall be upon his
[1:59:58] shoulder and he gives us the
[2:00:01] interpretation of Isaiah 9 and 6. what
[2:00:04] Isaiah 9 and 6 means because I know that
[2:00:07] in my mind I always had this picture
[2:00:10] like Atlas the you know the man that
[2:00:12] they show with the big globe on it she's
[2:00:14] a muscle man and he's got the whole
[2:00:17] world and it's amazing in some of those
[2:00:19] old buildings in Eastern Europe they
[2:00:22] have under the buildings you know it's a
[2:00:24] big Stone building and at one point in
[2:00:27] the building they have this Atlas it
[2:00:29] gives you the idea that he's holding up
[2:00:30] the whole building you know it's Atlas
[2:00:33] and then so in my mind I'm just thinking
[2:00:36] the government like the noun
[2:00:38] you know like the government all the
[2:00:40] governments of the world all the
[2:00:41] politics all the rulership of the world
[2:00:44] it's all on his shoulders because he's
[2:00:46] the great
[2:00:48] prime minister of it all
[2:00:51] and brother Branham says this scripture
[2:00:55] in Isaiah 9 6 comes from
[2:01:00] the Eastern marriage
[2:01:03] of the marriage ceremony that's where
[2:01:05] Isaiah 9 6 comes from is that Eastern
[2:01:09] marriage
[2:01:11] where she
[2:01:15] takes off her veil
[2:01:21] and when she does
[2:01:23] she just dips her head a little bit
[2:01:27] to take it off
[2:01:29] you know not this Catholic idea of
[2:01:32] hanging your head down all the time
[2:01:36] and you know woe is me and I'm a sinner
[2:01:39] and I should live better for God and I'm
[2:01:42] just really not being what I should be
[2:01:44] and you know I just want you to know
[2:01:47] Lord that I'm not happy with myself and
[2:01:49] I I I pray that you accept this offering
[2:01:54] it's kind of an offering I came up with
[2:01:56] myself but it's it's what I want to give
[2:01:59] to you is that I want to be sorry and
[2:02:01] I'm sorry about my condition I'm sorry I
[2:02:03] don't do better is that what kind of a
[2:02:05] bride can you imagine a man that wanted
[2:02:08] a bride and never saw her face
[2:02:11] but when she takes that Veil off she
[2:02:15] just dips her head a little
[2:02:18] my husband my Lord the Lover of My Soul
[2:02:22] the one who chose me I'm bowing my head
[2:02:26] and I'm surrendering myself to you I'm
[2:02:30] putting
[2:02:32] my Authority or or the responsibility to
[2:02:36] me over your shoulders we have time just
[2:02:40] to read that just a moment are you too
[2:02:41] tired to read a little bit
[2:02:57] but what does the key signify
[2:03:00] the answer lies in the position of the
[2:03:02] key
[2:03:03] it is not in his hand it is not worn
[2:03:06] around his neck
[2:03:08] it is not placed in the hands of other
[2:03:10] men or the verse could not be saying he
[2:03:13] alone has the use of that key
[2:03:16] for he alone opens and shuts and no man
[2:03:19] has the right but Jesus himself
[2:03:23] isn't that right
[2:03:25] but where is the key
[2:03:29] it is on his shoulder
[2:03:31] but what does shoulder have to do with
[2:03:33] it
[2:03:34] read Isaiah 9 6 and the government shall
[2:03:37] be upon his shoulder but what does this
[2:03:40] mean the answer is this the phrase
[2:03:44] government upon his shoulder comes from
[2:03:46] the wedding ceremony of the East
[2:03:49] when the bride has been committed to the
[2:03:52] groom she takes off her veil and places
[2:03:55] it over the groom's shoulders signifying
[2:03:58] that not only is she under his Dominion
[2:04:03] that she has transferred her rights to
[2:04:06] him
[2:04:08] that he is her head
[2:04:11] that he is the head
[2:04:13] but also
[2:04:14] that he Bears the responsibility and the
[2:04:19] care
[2:04:20] and that he and he alone
[2:04:23] no one else no other man no other power
[2:04:27] has any right and responsibility
[2:04:33] isn't it wouldn't it be
[2:04:35] so terrible
[2:04:37] to stop
[2:04:39] at that point and say well I'm not
[2:04:41] giving up I'm not I'm not going to be
[2:04:43] anybody's fool I'm I'm not giving up my
[2:04:46] ambitions I got some plans I got some
[2:04:48] things I'm going to do Brother David
[2:04:53] wouldn't it be terrible to stop at that
[2:04:56] and not come into this next beautiful
[2:05:00] place that every believer has this
[2:05:04] feminine spirit because we're the church
[2:05:07] now let's let's get out of the natural
[2:05:09] realm and let and let's take our place
[2:05:12] as his bride that's all of us as a
[2:05:16] Believer we should desire this feminine
[2:05:20] place
[2:05:21] to come under
[2:05:23] his wing
[2:05:25] and to come under his and and what
[2:05:27] blessed my soul saints of God is this
[2:05:30] word
[2:05:32] no other man has any right
[2:05:35] remember over in Jeremiah
[2:05:37] I don't mean to go on a bunny trail but
[2:05:39] remember when the uncle came
[2:05:42] to Jeremiah in the prison and he said
[2:05:44] buy my land because the right of
[2:05:47] redemption is yours you're the one that
[2:05:50] has the right to redeem that's why I
[2:05:53] came to you because you're in that
[2:05:54] position the right of redemption is
[2:05:56] yours so the Bible says no other man has
[2:06:00] the power
[2:06:01] and no other has any right
[2:06:04] and responsibility he is taking
[2:06:10] responsibility for you
[2:06:13] responsibility for your natural life
[2:06:16] responsibility for your spiritual life
[2:06:19] responsibility for your heart heart that
[2:06:22] your heart's not going to drift away
[2:06:24] from him the responsibility for your
[2:06:26] sound mind
[2:06:29] he's taking responsibility for you
[2:06:37] and that beloved is the Key of David God
[2:06:40] being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine
[2:06:43] decree exactly who would be in his pride
[2:06:46] he chose her
[2:06:48] she did not choose him
[2:06:50] he called her she did not come on her
[2:06:53] own
[2:06:54] he died for her he washed her in his own
[2:06:57] blood he paid the price for her
[2:07:02] she belongs to him
[2:07:04] and to him alone
[2:07:08] is that the way you feel this morning
[2:07:13] she is wholly committed to him
[2:07:18] I don't know about you but I don't got
[2:07:20] no place else to go I don't nobody's
[2:07:23] going to understand my problem a lot of
[2:07:25] times I wish I could go to somebody and
[2:07:28] say you know this is the this is the
[2:07:31] real Crux of the thing this is the thing
[2:07:33] that's really slippery about this slope
[2:07:36] this is the thing in this relationship
[2:07:38] that is really hard for me to figure out
[2:07:40] this is the thing where I don't know
[2:07:42] where I'm at or what if my thinking's
[2:07:44] right and I could go to somebody but I
[2:07:47] couldn't have that complete confidence
[2:07:50] that they knew
[2:07:52] the very wisdom of almighty God now I
[2:07:56] could have some confidence that God
[2:07:57] would help them I believe God puts those
[2:07:59] gifts in the church he puts people in
[2:08:02] your life your dad your mom I would I
[2:08:04] would encourage you young people to hang
[2:08:07] on to Mom and Dad I know it's tempting
[2:08:09] to say man they don't owe nothing but
[2:08:12] God gave you them
[2:08:14] God gave them to you
[2:08:17] do you think just God
[2:08:19] give you to them but it it goes both
[2:08:22] ways
[2:08:24] but
[2:08:26] but even in all of that
[2:08:29] there's a place you can go where you
[2:08:31] know
[2:08:32] that he knows
[2:08:34] you can go to him and you don't got
[2:08:36] nobody else like that to go to
[2:08:41] and she is wholly committed to him
[2:08:45] I love these words and he accepts that
[2:08:49] obligation
[2:08:51] so if you will
[2:08:54] holy commit yourself to him he's
[2:08:56] obligated
[2:09:00] well Street language would just say he's
[2:09:03] stuck you know somehow you got the Rook
[2:09:05] over here and you got the king you know
[2:09:07] just by your honesty just by your
[2:09:10] pureness of heart you moved the queen
[2:09:12] over there and the King you know and the
[2:09:14] bishop you know if you're playing chess
[2:09:15] I think they'd call that Checkmate but
[2:09:18] if you take God at his own word and your
[2:09:21] holy committed to him he accepts that
[2:09:25] obligation and he says yes I'm obligated
[2:09:31] he is her head
[2:09:33] for Christ is the head of his church
[2:09:37] as Sarah called Abraham Lord
[2:09:40] even so
[2:09:42] the bride is happy
[2:09:44] that he is her Lord
[2:09:48] he speaks and she obeys
[2:09:50] for that's her Delight
[2:09:53] ask the Lord to forgive me for the times
[2:09:55] I didn't obey
[2:09:56] I won't obey I want to be more obedient
[2:10:01] I want to be under that care
[2:10:04] but you have to accept it
[2:10:06] you see rulership would just rule over
[2:10:09] you whether you accepted it or not
[2:10:12] but brother Branham said it's your
[2:10:15] attitude toward the atonement
[2:10:18] the atonement is true
[2:10:20] he atoned he he did that at Calvary that
[2:10:23] blood is perfect blood the cleansing is
[2:10:25] perfect cleansing
[2:10:28] but you've got to accept that
[2:10:30] it's your attitude toward the atonement
[2:10:32] that blings the blessing to you
[2:10:37] I wanna
[2:10:39] not only accept
[2:10:44] his government
[2:10:46] I want to embrace it I want to I want to
[2:10:49] love it and I want to come under that
[2:10:53] shoulder I want to come into His Embrace
[2:10:56] is that your desire this morning let's
[2:10:58] stand together with a
[2:11:02] foreign
[2:11:04] [Applause]
[2:11:16] musicians just whatever you feel led to
[2:11:18] places
[2:11:26] brothers and sisters do you feel an
[2:11:28] urgency
[2:11:30] this morning
[2:11:32] you feel that in your heart that urgency
[2:11:37] to get right with God and to get
[2:11:41] get things out of the way
[2:11:43] life is fleeting
[2:11:49] maybe you younger folks don't feel that
[2:11:52] way you feel like you know you got all
[2:11:54] the time in the world but
[2:11:58] it goes by so fast
[2:12:01] don't squander it
[2:12:06] living outside his love don't squander
[2:12:09] your time
[2:12:10] chasing foolish
[2:12:13] Pursuits
[2:12:16] if you forgive me for saying that doing
[2:12:17] stupid stuff you don't have to live that
[2:12:20] way you can come under his government
[2:12:24] you can accept his embrace you can
[2:12:26] accept his leadership
[2:12:31] he's done
[2:12:32] interested in rulership he already rules
[2:12:35] the heavens and earth
[2:12:39] his
[2:12:41] leadership was the humble of the self
[2:12:45] become sin for us
[2:12:49] he wants fellowship and he's taken away
[2:12:52] everything that hinders
[2:12:54] his mercies are new every morning
[2:12:58] [Music]

[2:13:49] woman in the Book of Revelation she
[2:13:53] lived luxuriously
[2:13:56] she said I am no woman no Widow
[2:13:59] she didn't need no rulership Lord
[2:14:03] that's not us Lord we need you
[2:14:06] we love you
[2:14:08] we accept
[2:14:11] your government Lord

[2:14:28] life in our hearts and we Rejoice we
[2:14:31] want more of that Lord

[2:14:37] morning that never
[2:14:40] took off their Veil
[2:14:43] maybe hiding
[2:14:45] something Lord but
[2:14:48] if there be one in the building that's
[2:14:50] never come to that place of complete
[2:14:52] surrender Lord
[2:14:54] we make that invitation now

[2:18:49] you're never going to commit
[2:18:52] something into somebody else's hands
[2:18:55] unless you got complete confidence in
[2:18:58] them
[2:18:59] [Music]
[2:19:02] you're not gonna give your life to him
[2:19:06] just take a look at yourself and
[2:19:11] all the burdens you bear and all the
[2:19:14] things you're worried about and all
[2:19:15] things that you suffer and just
[2:19:20] simply comes to a time is when are you
[2:19:24] really going to trust him with it
[2:19:27] you know he loves you
[2:19:36] he's only going to do what's best for
[2:19:38] you
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:43] the outcome's going to be better when
[2:19:46] he handles it
[2:19:48] [Music]
[2:19:50] you don't have to
[2:19:53] know
[2:19:55] how he's going to do it
[2:19:58] what he's going to do you just got to
[2:20:00] know that he loves you and
[2:20:05] he's going to see it through and the
[2:20:08] outcome is going to be the best
[2:20:10] [Music]
[2:20:13] that's when he becomes
[2:20:16] Lord of it all
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:22] and it you know you
[2:20:25] you would think that
[2:20:27] the enemy would want to make you feel
[2:20:29] guilty
[2:20:33] for placing in his hands
[2:20:38] but I am guilty
[2:20:41] that's the whole point
[2:20:45] and I have no place else to turn or go
[2:20:48] to
[2:20:49] him
[2:20:52] he just finally come to the place you
[2:20:54] say I can't do this
[2:20:57] I can't do this
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:01] and that's why he says that's why I'm
[2:21:03] taking my government
[2:21:07] I'll take
[2:21:10] charge
[2:21:11] of getting it done for you
[2:21:20] I've been there a few places in my life
[2:21:23] [Music]
[2:21:25] or I just couldn't bear it no longer
[2:21:33] [Music]
[2:21:34] thank you
[2:21:40] my heart's moved this morning
[2:21:45] because my
[2:21:48] Brothers lost two children
[2:21:53] foreign
[2:21:57] he knows what it means to
[2:22:01] put it in the hands of the Lord
[2:22:06] and I think that's all that he's asking
[2:22:09] this morning
[2:22:13] you're willing to
[2:22:16] just say Lord here I am
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:21] I'm I'm willing to turn it over
[2:22:25] to you this morning
[2:22:30] I'm not going to worry about my job
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:35] not going to worry about my future
[2:22:38] I'm not going to worry about my health
[2:22:44] I'm not going to worry about my finances
[2:22:51] [Music]
[2:22:52] not gonna worry about tomorrow
[2:22:57] I'm going to let you be my government
[2:23:00] [Music]
[2:23:06] I'm going to let you govern
[2:23:10] my footsteps
[2:23:14] because this scripture says the
[2:23:15] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[2:23:17] by the Lord
[2:23:21] I'm going to let you govern
[2:23:24] my tomorrow
[2:23:31] you know that's especially hard for me
[2:23:34] [Music]
[2:23:37] just to let it go
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:43] but you'll find when you do
[2:23:45] that it's in the Master's Hand
[2:23:49] he can create
[2:23:51] for you where there's nothing
[2:23:55] ever there
[2:23:58] he can change things that nobody else
[2:24:01] can change
[2:24:05] and I think that that's the
[2:24:09] what the Lord's just begging he wants
[2:24:12] his bride to be his bride
[2:24:14] but he wants to be the husband
[2:24:17] [Music]
[2:24:18] maybe each of us can take a little
[2:24:20] deeper look in our heart
[2:24:23] this morning
[2:24:28] and you could take all that what you're
[2:24:30] worried about
[2:24:32] and all that's burdening you
[2:24:39] and you could cast your cares upon Him
[2:24:44] for he careth for you
[2:24:49] each in your own heart this morning
[2:24:54] let's take a look at all what you're
[2:24:56] worried about
[2:25:00] as little as a car payment
[2:25:07] to the health of a loved one
[2:25:10] to your children and their future
[2:25:16] maybe to the amount of allotted days
[2:25:19] that God's Got
[2:25:21] set for you
[2:25:26] the unanswered questions in your heart
[2:25:29] and mind
[2:25:32] and you just stop and say Lord I've

[2:27:22] transfer the burden to him
[2:27:24] [Music]
[2:27:26] so you can go free
[2:27:30] so you can share the love of God
[2:27:33] that shed abroad in your heart with the
[2:27:36] Holy Spirit
