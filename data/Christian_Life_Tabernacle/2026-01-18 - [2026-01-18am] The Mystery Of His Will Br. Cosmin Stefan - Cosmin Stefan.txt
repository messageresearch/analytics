Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 18th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[music] I may [singing] not know what you're going through. May not can make that high [singing and music] mountain move. But one thing I found that I really want you to know, if it matters to [singing] you, it matters to the master. He wants to share the burdens [singing] you bear. Whisper [music] peace when your world gets shattered. [singing] If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're [singing] really needing an answer, if [music] it matters to you, it matters [singing] to the master. Friend, do you [singing] think the maker and giver of life is far [singing] too busy [music] to care about your trouble strife? [music] He sees a sparrow that falls to the ground and he hears [singing and music] the tears that don't make a sound. And only you [singing and music] knew how precious you are in a sight. [music] If [singing] it matters to you, it matters [music] to the master. He wants to share the burdens [singing and music] you bear. Whisper peace when your world gets [singing] shattered. If it's your greatest [music] joy or your deepest pain or [singing] you're really needing an answer, [music] if it [singing] matters to you, it matters to the master. [singing and music] If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're [singing] really needing an answer, if [music] it matters to you, it doesn't only matter to [singing] you. If it matters to you, matters [singing] to the master. [applause and music] [applause] Too glad whatever concerns you concerns him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like how our pastor put it last Sunday. He told Samuel, he said, "If they rejected you, they rejected me." Amen. Why? Because you are the very representative of who he is, of everything that he is. Amen. Amen. Just a reminder, uh, uh, January 30th, it's between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m. will be our, uh, monthly youth meeting. So, uh, we'll post it in the youth chat. So, for all those, Amen. in the youth group, amen, to know. Uh, we have a couple of testimonies. Sister Nikki writes, "I want to thank the Lord for answering prayers and and restoring my wedding ring that was lost." Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. He's the restorer of all that we have lost. Amen. So it don't matter whatever you lost this morning, you can say, "Lord, can you restore it to me, Lord?" Amen. Sister Alicia writes, "I want to give thanks for everyone who prays uh who was offering prayers for me. uh since much medicine didn't have uh uh the same effect as the healing that God has been giving me through the love of my brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ. Divine love it's says divine love is what my whole being has felt. May God richly bless you. Amen. Amen. I tell you [music] uh words can heal [clears throat] God. You could just speak the word and it provides healing to the soul. [music] I I'll tell you this. There's nothing that can really heal the spirit like the word of God. Amen. The flesh, you could go to the doctor, but even the spirit when he gets wounded, the word brings healing to our souls and our bodies. Amen. Brother John the Baptist write this.

Why don't you just give her a hand this morning? Amen. Amen. [applause] Amen. Amen. It's good to [music] see sister Leslie back and certainly thank the Lord for that. Amen. Brother David is home this morning not feeling well. I spoke with him. He was just coughing and you know just couldn't finish a [music] sentence so he wasn't feeling well this morning. We just want to lift our pastor up in prayer this morning. Amen. I believe just our prayers can certainly just uh uh touch him and bring the healing that he needs in his body. Amen. So if you have it upon your heart this morning, why don't you just lift your hand up to him? [music] Amen. He hasn't changed. His word is the same. [music] And I believe this morning when we approach his throne, we approach it according to the promises and [music] the way that he's made for us to come.

[music] And when you when you eat, you know, a lot of times when you sit at the table, sorry, brother Matthew, it's just [snorts] it's just how it is when we sit at the table. Sometimes I'll sit at the table and eat with brother Matthew and we just discuss how good the tenders are or how good the barbecue is. Just simp simplicity &gt;&gt; and the taste and the seasoning and all these things that have got and got done behind the scenes so you can enjoy a meal. I mean, it took work &gt;&gt; and you ate it in 30 minutes. I mean, it's so good and now you're full. Amen. Never forget that is the grace of God that he came and he prepared a meal for you. &gt;&gt; And it's not something that's humanmade. It's something that's the almighty God had made this meal that once you eat out of it, you'll never hunger again. Praise the Lord. Once you drink out of this word, you'll never thirst again. I mean, that's that's the way he works. He doesn't give you something that will perish. He gives you always something that's eternal. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that perishes in God. There's no there's absolutely no harm. There's no fault in God and his word. He's always perfect. &gt;&gt; So, there's no perversion of his word. It's it's true genuine. I mean, receive him this morning. Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; We greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus. It's I'm just looking at your faces. Give me Give me a minute. I may have you stand, but let's God bless you. Sister Leslie, God bless you. I mean, Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Jonathan, God bless you.

Amen. And we just want to bring you a few greetings from our local church, Nazareth Tabernacle. I mean, we're serving there and the Lord's been doing wonderful things. &gt;&gt; Um, his word will never come back without I mean he he his word will always come back bringing fruit. &gt;&gt; And it's not the fruit of man. It's the fruit of the word. &gt;&gt; Man never gets credit because the God is not a respector of person. So what what happens is the word is the one that brings the seed and and we're thankful for that. The Lord's, you know, is growing our little body there. Keep us in prayer. Are the battles just as hard there as as it is here. We're fighting against the same spirits. We're fighting against the same uh it's just true. It comes without even you expecting. That's why you have to be guarded. &gt;&gt; You're living in the day of a war. It's it's a spiritual war. So, you have to be protected at all times. You have to you have to be able to know how to block. You have to be be able you have to know how to respond because people these days don't fight with swords and shields and knives and they fight with words. They fight with actions. They fight with attitude. Amen. It's just how it is. So, be protected. Be be shielded, Brother Ben. Amen. Be dressed into the armor of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to welcome my family. I don't know where they are. I appreciate them very much. I love them very much. They they mean so much to me. Everything that we are doing. If it wasn't for my family, I couldn't do it. It's just the way I That's just the way that it's my testimony. I couldn't do it without my family. So, just pray for them. We love them. God bless you, Sister Holly. Amen. And my kids. We thank you for the hospitality here in Dallas Fort Worth. We we feel we feel like kings. We do. And that's just the scripture. That's just how Thank you, brother David, for the opportunity to be here. He's a close friend to my heart. We've we've served here for a lot of years. And you'll always be a special people in my heart. Amen. In one day, we'll see on the we'll see each other on the other side. And you won't be for five minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, Brother Billy. But it'll be for how long? [snorts] Hallelujah. I mean, yeah, that's the type of love we have to have. It has to be expressed here before it could be expressed there. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't say right. It has to be expressed here because when we see each other, you'll use the same exact love to be able to recognize your brother. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the character is the love that God gave you. So, when you see each other, you excited to see your brother and I'll be like, "Oh, you made it, too." &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. It's true. I want to be excited to see you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God I mean he gave his only begotten son, &gt;&gt; right? So whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal or everlasting life. God bless you. If you have your scriptures, let's just open this morning. We're just going to have a small thought that the Lord placed upon my heart and Isaiah chapter 60 verses 1 through 1, two, and three. Isaiah chapter 60:es 1-3. And I want to be an encouragement for you this morning. I don't know. I don't know your condition. I don't know the way you walked in. I have no idea. All I know that there is a word that knows it all. And it's the word that goes and discerns into the intent of the heart and gives you the medication and what you need. So you can go and and and pull upon the word if it's inside of you because the only way that you can pull in the word if it's in you. &gt;&gt; You cannot you cannot how can I say this? The word is already in you. You just have to get it discovered. &gt;&gt; And so when you get it discovered is a revelation. And the revelation gives you love. I believe that &gt;&gt; because we're living in the capstone, &gt;&gt; right? It's a capstone coming down. So when you catch the revelation of the age, you're catching divine love. If it's not producing divine love, then it's perverted and it's all all it is. It it's uh it's it's just doctrine. I don't want to say it's it's doctrine, right? It's letter. But really, the revelation of Jesus Christ is love because Jesus Christ was the love of God. And the love of God became flesh and dwelt among us and is living among us right now. SL praise the Lord. How do you know them? By their love. &gt;&gt; So express the love of Jesus Christ, that divine love that he wants you to have because that's the light. &gt;&gt; The love is the light. &gt;&gt; He was the light and that's the light. Isaiah 60 one through one, two, and three. Arise, shine, for thy light is come &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; So it's not upon somebody else if this is personal. &gt;&gt; So it's risen upon who? &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're it's it's risen upon you. The sunshine now. The sun is upon you. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth. How many of you can say this morning that this world is covered in darkness? If you have spiritual eyes, you would be able to see it. If your eyes are not spiritual, you're partaking of Sodom and Gomorrah. But may God open all of our eyes so we can read in between the lines and understand that that the position or the world the way it is this day, it's so dark that people don't even know where they're going. &gt;&gt; It's like walking with canes. You know, you're walking with the cane and you don't know where the next step is because all they're doing is guessing. And God doesn't guess. God knows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God doesn't guess. He knows because he is everything. He's alpha, omega. He's the beginning and the end. He's all the in between. Amen. And he he's always going to be. It'll take eternity for God to express himself. Even on the other side, it'll be eternity to express eternity &gt;&gt; because there's absolutely no end. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so there's no more time, but we're in eternity walking with him until we get a body change. How many believe for that? &gt;&gt; Right? Because he's going to come back and he's not going to ask you, did you buy faith? &gt;&gt; Did you work for faith? Did you did do you have in your back pocket? No. He's going to ask you, do you have it? &gt;&gt; Because it's the token. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the way that you will be changed. It was the Abrahamic covenant that we had in the beginning. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Darkness shall cover the earth and grows darkness the people. &gt;&gt; But the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Hallelujah. Now you there's only one f one type of glory and that's the glory of God. People want to receive glory, but there's only one kind of glory, and this is the glory of God. And his glory is humble. &gt;&gt; And the Gentile SHALL COME TO THY LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So that means that you produce such a light that you will be able to magnetize people to your light. &gt;&gt; Because it's so dark. Imagine. I apologize that I'm keeping you standing for a few moments, but that's just uh imagine if it'd be total darkness in the room and all of a sudden I have brother Dylan just have a little candle light. Wouldn't everybody want to go next to the light so they can see, hey, let's get out of here somehow &gt;&gt; because I don't know where the exits are, &gt;&gt; right? Because light produces something, &gt;&gt; right? gives you introduces you to something I mean that's greater. It's an exodus. It's a going away. It's not I mean THIS THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR US TO STAY. &gt;&gt; This message IS PREPARING OUR BRIDE TO GO HOME. &gt;&gt; So are are we prepared this morning? Are your hearts dressed in the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say that. And the GENTILES SHALL COME TO THE LIGHT AND KINGS and the and kings to the brightness of thy rising. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Gentiles shall come to that light and kings to the brightness of that rising. Romans chapter 8 verse 28. Just a few more verses and we can sit down, very known scripture. We know that the Holy Ghost brings these things to your remembrance. It's not it's not something new, but it's inspired so that way you can you can the Lord can quicken it to your heart. Amen. And we know now, do you know? Verse 28, and it says, "And we know." So the question is, do you know &gt;&gt; that all things work together for good to them that love God? Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; To them who are called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate &gt;&gt; to be conformed to the image of his son. &gt;&gt; So the point is is that we have to be conformed to the image of his son. And he only had one son that was able to bring restoration back in flesh and that was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now not a two Jes NOT A JESUS CHRIST 2,000 years ago but a JESUS CHRIST THAT CAME IN MALACHI 4:5 &gt;&gt; because that was the PROMISE THAT CAME TO ABRAHAM. A mazdc had TO COME SHOW THE LIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE IT AND BECOME THE SAME EXACTLY like &gt;&gt; I mean it's YOUR PROMISE. DID YOU KNOW? Did you know? &gt;&gt; That was the purpose. &gt;&gt; From whom he did for know, he also did predestinate. &gt;&gt; Okay. How did he predestinate you? By a word that came out of a prophet's mouth. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU HAD TO BE BORN in this generation. &gt;&gt; So he can call your name. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY WORTHY TO OPEN THE BOOK BUT HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; And it was the lamb that came and took the book. And it was only a few that received it after the book was open because everybody fleeed from brother Brandham whenever the opening of the seals came forth. &gt;&gt; Right? Because he was calling your name. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NO LONGER ABOUT THE FIRST AND THE SECOND. IT WAS NOW ABOUT THE THIRD WHICH WAS THE BIG FISH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The rainbow fish. The fish that has the seven colors. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE ONE the one that knew it WAS THE CATCH. &gt;&gt; GOD IS A GOD OF RECORD. If you if you didn't know that he's a god of record. There's always something bigger. You know, have you ever seen a trout that big? Well, you know, the prophet caught it. &gt;&gt; It But it was it was it was trained by God to do that. &gt;&gt; It was the word of God now becoming flesh to call your name, &gt;&gt; to call you out of an Egypt and to take you into a promised land. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; Now, I know you know, but I'm just re-emphasizing emphasizing it. It's justified as in it's already been passed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So remember, did you know that when he predestinated you, he's already given you the result into justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But you have to be called by that voice. You have TO BE CALLED BY THAT word &gt;&gt; because it was it it's the word that that attracts you. &gt;&gt; If you were written by the word, it was it would be only the word that could be able to describe you. If you're a written epistle, people have to read YOU TO GET TO KNOW YOU, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Like a a book a book doesn't talk. &gt;&gt; A book doesn't talk. &gt;&gt; Does anybody have a book that Unless you have these AI ones where they they put the computer inside the book. Think about it. And then it but a book don't talk. &gt;&gt; A book is read. But when they read it, they read the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you're a book. You're a book. And when people read you, they read what's inside of your heart. &gt;&gt; They read, they live, they read what's inside of your book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 31. &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? If God before us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Father, Lord, in simplicity, we just want to encourage your bride this morning, Lord. We &gt;&gt; We know we can't do nothing without you. We are absolutely just a piece of clay, a hand of dirt, Lord, that you've just created. But, Father, we know that it's your spirit that gives life. And so Lord, this morning, may you, Lord, your Holy Spirit, may your word be here in our midst to be able to just discern the hearts of our the condition of our hearts and give us the medication that we need, Father, to be able to walk from this place closer to you, Lord. Your your home here, the church is a place of correction. This is where we come, Lord, and you correct us. You lead us. You instruct us, oh Lord. This is a place where your bride gathers together to worship you, to lift up your name, Father. Lord, it's it's it's the image. It this is this is what you've called us to be to be in fellowship, Lord. This is this was the image that you had in the beginning for your bride to be able to be together, Father. And so, we just ask that you are welcome in our midst this morning. May you take control. May you take every thought under your control, Father. May you be, Lord, a speaker. May we just trust upon all that would be said that would be that would encourage the bride here locally. We thank you Lord. You can anoint a man all you want, but the bride has to be anointed just as well, Father, for us to be able to receive the word. So I pray that you anoint her ears that it wouldn't just come one out of one ear and go the other, but Lord, but may it come down into the heart and root love in there, Father. Clean up what it needs to clean up, Lord. Restore what needs to be stored, Father. Because we living in a day where darkness is upon this upon this world and it's trying to influence the bride of Jesus Christ, away from a I mean away from your rapture, away from a body change, away for a a greater maturity that you've called us for, Lord. And may we always be stable upon upon this upon this path that you've given us. May we never waver left to right. May we always try to stay in the middle of the ground, Father. May you always correct our hearts and may we be children of obedience. Oh Lord, don't make us. We don't want to be a children of disobedience. I want to be a child that obeys your word. Father, REGARDLESS IF IT STRIKES MY HEART, IF IT JUDGES my exterior, if it cleans me out, Lord, I want to take it because I know it's for the good. Oh Lord, when you when we love you, we know that all things work for the good. And we appreciate you for doing that for us this morning. May you take control. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. and God bless you. You can have your seats. I want to speak just for a few moments this morning on the mystery of his will. And the Lord just kind of was working on my heart a few weeks ago. And and it's so important to know what a will is because you know he has a mystery of something that he has left behind for you to be able to inherit. And so you understand this this this didn't come by guessing. &gt;&gt; Or let me put it this way. God didn't volunteer you to come. &gt;&gt; God God don't need volunteers. &gt;&gt; He didn't say would you. No. When he went and called Peter, when he went and called Matthew, when he went and called all his disciples, he says, "Come follow me." &gt;&gt; He didn't ask them. All he did is he told them. And whatever they were doing at that moment, they left their fishing poles, they left their boats, they left everything they had and they went to follow Jesus because they knew that the word was going to come in their midst. How? Well, they knew the scripture. So when they seen the living word in their midst, they says, "Oh, this must be that Messiah, &gt;&gt; right?" Because the book was not read. And that gave confidence to the DISCIPLES TO SAY, "NOW the word IS IN OUR MIDST. WHAT WILL HAPPEN? 30 years that God had trained you. I mean, think about it. 30 years that Jesus Christ had lived on this earth for a three and a half year journey to fulfill all that he fulfilled. How many scriptures were fulfilled within that lifetime of three and a half years that he he preached the gospel and he went and and cleaned out the tabernacles? Think about it. He went and he turned the tables over and he healed the sick and all he did he did good. BUT BECAUSE HE DID GOOD, people were going against him, calling him a bellzeub, &gt;&gt; BUT ALL HE DID WAS GOOD. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WERE PEOPLE WERE FOLLOWING HIM, SAYING, "I heal me. I need I need healing. I need this. I need that." And that was good. But remember when the WHEN THE CHANGE HAPPENED WHEN NOW HE WAS PREACHING THE WORD OF GOD, CALLING, GOING DEEPER, and saying, "Okay, you love me that much. Now, let me speak this. Let me speak these mysteries to you that only the elect can be pulled by these because those are the ones that read IT IN BETWEEN THE LINES. &gt;&gt; Not all that call being Lord, Lord shall inherit, &gt;&gt; right? Because God had given you something special for you to be able TO BE ATTRACTED BY this word &gt;&gt; and not just any word is the fullness of the word. The word has been restored BUT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF IT. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. In Ephesus, they had a portion in Smith. They had a portion and they had a portion all THE WAY TO THE LAST TO THE LAST church age. But now that the last CHURCH AGE HAS STOPPED, TIME HAS ended and eternity HAS STARTED BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL WORD. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't depend ON SOMETHING IN THE PAST, BUT YOU DEPEND ON SOMETHING IN THE PRESENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He wants you to get a God that's present. &gt;&gt; A revelation that's present. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A REVELATION THAT'S FOR TODAY. &gt;&gt; NOT A RE WHATEVER WAS YESTERDAY, if it wasn't eaten, you had to burn it. &gt;&gt; If you can follow me, can you can you guys follow a little bit? &gt;&gt; If you didn't eat it yesterday is no longer good because now you need something fresh. &gt;&gt; You could have you could have collected 12 baskets of mana. &gt;&gt; By the morning it was gone. &gt;&gt; And then you woke up and somehow God supernaturally gave you new mana. And then you went and you ate. because that's God. That's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; So you always need new food. You always need good food. EVERY DAY YOU GOT TO YOU GOT TO EAT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT GOD MATURES HIS BRIDE IS BY CONSTANTLY BEING IN FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The world's changing. &gt;&gt; Are you changing? &gt;&gt; The world's changing and it's not for the good. &gt;&gt; BUT DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT CHARACTER TO OVERCOME THE CHARACTER that's trying to come against you? RIGHT? BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE SUCH A LOVE. NOW, think about this because there there will come a time where the evil is going to be so so bad that you're going to have to love your neighbor your neighbor or you're going to have to love, you know, your enemy as yourself. &gt;&gt; So, God's going to be able to train you in such a way where you can love the enemy as yourself. &gt;&gt; Why? Because because it's the condition that the people are living in. &gt;&gt; They're drinking. They're marrying. They're concentrating upon their image. They're concentrating on who can have the best followers. I'm just speaking of what's going on in the world. I'm sure we all know. I mean, how many thousands of views have I had on my little Tik Tok posting that I put? Because if I go over 50,000, Brother Billy, I start getting money. So, I want to be popular because the the more craziest things I could put on the internet, right, the the more followers I have and I can make money doing nothing, doing crazy things. Right? &gt;&gt; You see how now money is being earned and people are getting rich by being foolish, expressing what's in their life and people follow that and they get they're they're called influencers. And so ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE THEM START DRESSING LIKE THAT INDIVIDUAL. Start acting like that individual. Hallelujah. If there's a follower, I WANT TO follow Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE LIKE JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT IS THE image of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; He left it for you to see it &gt;&gt; and not an image of 2,000 years ago or image of today &gt;&gt; because he spoke to you an image of today. How to overcome, not what to overcome, but how to overcome in the days that you're living in. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO CATCH IT BY revelation &gt;&gt; because the breads and the fishes was only attracting. &gt;&gt; It was only attracting. But the ones that went all the way &gt;&gt; was the ones that their names have been revealed out of the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God would say in proving his word, I try to get this quote so we can just walk through a little bit. 1964 August 16, paragraph 210. Proving his word. He proves all of his words. Are you a word this morning? &gt;&gt; So he proves all of his words. SO THERE WON'T BE NOT ONE WORD THAT HE WON'T PROVE. &gt;&gt; He's got to prove them all. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to have to prove them all from the from the little to the biggest. &gt;&gt; FROM THE BIGGEST TO THE LITTLE. &gt;&gt; I MEAN FROM A CHILD I mean to the most mature. &gt;&gt; HE'S PROVING ALL OF HIS WORDS. Just think of it. All of his words. And you were his word. and he was the word and you were part of his word &gt;&gt; and that's the reason you're sent here &gt;&gt; to confirm your place in life. &gt;&gt; Why were you sent here? So your birth, the prophet says that is more of a paradox than the birth of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I I I didn't know what to think when the prophet said that. I'm serious because it's such a humble and if Jesus Christ was overshadowed by the angel and here's Mary receiving the word in her womb and and she carried that word inside of her for for nine months and he has to leave I believe he has to leave Nazareth to go to Bethlehem and it was a journey of a few days and Mary sitting on a donkey and there was no place for him to go lay in &gt;&gt; and so they find a barn and the prophet says that his first clothes was the actual I mean the covering the blanket of a donkey &gt;&gt; that Mary had rode for so many days. They took the blanket of a donkey and they wrapped Jesus Christ in this blanket because Jesus I mean my birth wasn't like that. &gt;&gt; But I do know this that if he did that he did it for me. &gt;&gt; If he came that way was to come and redeem me. Praise the Lord. TO SHOW THAT THIS LIFE HAS NO IMPORTANCE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAS SOMETHING GREATER FOR YOU. AMEN. Remember the devil had perverted the original because he cannot create. &gt;&gt; So all he did is perverted what God had created in such a way that he wanted you to see THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT these things that you put your five senses on but it's about the five senses of the spiritual realm that you have to understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. And out of, think about it, out of a million germs, the prophet says that God chose one germ to unite with, you know, the the other half of the world to to to the earth, right? And so them two created a gene that now was born into existence. &gt;&gt; That gene, the prophet says, was a supernatural gene &gt;&gt; because it came from your grandfather, your great greatgrandfather, your great great. So God watched over your seed. You're not a nobody. &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just like Jesus had a flesh where the spirit could unite with it. You have a flesh where your spirit could unite with that word. &gt;&gt; Think you have to. IT'S YOUR SPIRIT. YOU'RE SUPERNATURAL. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE INTO THE SUPERNATURAL. YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN. A lot of people CALL US ALIENS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. be think about especially the immigr on the immigration side when you get a passport they give you an alien number it's just the way the process happens here and they give and they know you by the alien number but we're absolute aliens we're not of this world we're pilgrims and strangers and once you start living in ETERNITY YOU'LL START SEEING YOURSELF HERE MORE LIKE JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HE CREATED IN THE BEGINNING HE CREATED YOU TO be like him &gt;&gt; it's now the expression time &gt;&gt; do you know that you have been called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; The purpose of God was for you to be here. &gt;&gt; Now, find what to do with that. &gt;&gt; Find what to do with that because God has something for you. &gt;&gt; Even if I want to be even if God made me a doormat, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know what? I want to be a doormat. And you know, you know what I would do, brother Matthew? When people would walk in, I would tickle their feet &gt;&gt; so they could have a smile on their face. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the expression of God. God is love. &gt;&gt; God is love. &gt;&gt; There's no there's no there's no evil in God. &gt;&gt; God doesn't God even his hate is in love. &gt;&gt; He can't hate. &gt;&gt; It's a perversion of love. So God is love. GOD GOD IS HIS THAT THAT THAT'S HIM. That's the way he expresses himself. SO GOD CALLED YOU to confirm your place in this life. Amen. Find your identity. Find find who you are. You know a will. Does everybody know what a will is? Like when you have an inheritance will every a few. A will. So a will is something that when somebody passes on, it's an abstract that leaves you your inheritance. And what's yours? You cannot change it. You cannot add to it. You cannot take away from it. It's written by the father. It's been sealed by the father. And it remains sealed by the father until everyone receives their inheritance. Even if in that inheritance is said, I have a child at 12 years old. He cannot inherit this until he's 18. His grace will allow it. Think about it. It's a natural I it's the grace of God because he wants he doesn't want to lose a one. That's why he depends on grace because he wants every single one of his words to come to pass. &gt;&gt; He wants every single one of his children to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; You can be grain, but remember, he's only coming for those that are mature, that are ripened. So, you have to sit under the ripening of the sun. &gt;&gt; You have to sit under the ripening of this word for you to be ready for harvest. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet would say in the quote, "The combine's coming. &gt;&gt; The combine's coming." &gt;&gt; What does the combine do? The combine comes and grabs the grain, separates the tears away from the grain, puts the grain in the machine, and when the machine gets to the barn, it deposits it and says, "It's done. It's over. All the elect are here. &gt;&gt; Now, the great tribulation is going to have to start happening because they have to go through a cleansing. But the combine's coming. So, what are you going to do?" I Amen. LIFT UP YOUR EYES. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD BECAUSE YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWS NIGH. &gt;&gt; You have to be aware in the times you're living in. Don't be FOOLED BY THE WAY THIS DEVIL'S TRYING TO PAINT A PICTURE OUT IN the other world for you. You got to stay in the real world. &gt;&gt; Stay in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A will. It's an abstract. There's names in there. It has your date of birth. It has who you it has it has the the the funds and the assets that have been written in this will that the children get to inherit. Think about it because everything that's his is yours. &gt;&gt; And nothing can break this will nothing can break this abstract because God has wrote it for you. So all you have to do is get in the book and find your inheritance and what belongs to you &gt;&gt; because this is you. &gt;&gt; HE CAME AND OPENED THE BOOK SO HE can read your name. So when he read your name, he didn't read your your human name, brother Gary or brother Dylan or uh Amen. He didn't read your normal name. He didn't he didn't read He didn't read your fleshly name. He read the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you are in the word. So when he called the word, he called you. &gt;&gt; He didn't call you by your natural name, BUT HE WENT INSIDE YOUR HEART and discerned your heart AND HE TOLD YOU THAT THIS IS HIM. &gt;&gt; SO NOW THAT HE'S IN YOU, &gt;&gt; you can't do nothing but stay next to him &gt;&gt; because that if you received him that way, if you didn't receive him that way, I say that may the Lord give you grace to receive him that way. Don't let it just remain up here. &gt;&gt; Up here is good, but the devil's going to try to come and battle it out, &gt;&gt; but once it's rooted in here, &gt;&gt; the devil can't even read it. &gt;&gt; It's under the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And nothing could touch it. &gt;&gt; You're safe. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to apply the blood. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to apply the blood. So when the angel comes, you're not disturbed. &gt;&gt; So in this in this Amen. It shows in this will how much goes to each individual. &gt;&gt; And he's always a fair God because he created Jesus so he can be the firstborn. But he didn't leave it there because Jesus was going to have brothers that were going to come, brothers and sisters that were going to come through that same. You have to come through the door. There's no other way. You have to come through the door through Jesus Christ so you can be just like he was in the beginning. He restored a word to you that when you receive that word by revelation, that's what transforms your body. &gt;&gt; Not, oh Lord, how can I do this? Oh Lord, how can I accomplish this? That's not the way that God works. Lord, how can you accomplish this in my life? &gt;&gt; And your word says that the Amen. seek the kingdom of God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not what I say. It's what he says. And if God gives YOU A FAITH, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU DEPEND ON WHAT HE SAID AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE ON WHAT HE SAID. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE three months, 6 months, a year, two, it doesn't matter. Abraham waited 25 years for me promise that Mckedic told him, &gt;&gt; but one day it came to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he he wanted him to understand, okay, it took 25 years, Lord, for me to get my son. I appreciate this, but now you're asking me to go sacrifice my only son. You're going to you're going to ask me to go kill my own son, the one that you gave me by promise. I've waited. I've made a mistake doing this. I I listened to Sarah and I made I MADE EVEN THOUGH GOD BLESSED ISHMAEL, I mean he it just shows the denominational side of perverting something that's not part of the truth. So you can you can be I mean you can you can be a vessel. You can be the seed of Abraham, but if you rush into a decision, you can create a denomination out of yourself. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PROMISE OF THE OF THE OF THE LIVING GOD AT HIS PROPER TIME TO COME LIVE INSIDE OF YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T RUSH THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; TRUST THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; YOU RUSH THE PROCESS, IT'LL BE A DENOMINATION. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAS TO BE IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S THE HEAD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And you're the body &gt;&gt; and the body does what the head &gt;&gt; tells it to do. A lot of times a lot of times you you know our brains are so it's just the way it is. But you know you the command of reaching out your hand or maybe when you get burnt or maybe when something like you react so quick because your your brain is so I mean it's so God made it in such a supernatural way that he gave you that instinct to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. But once he's sanctified under the Holy Ghost, it has the same effect spiritually. My brother and sister, &gt;&gt; these two have to come together. You can't let your flesh live one way and your spirit live another way. &gt;&gt; They'll always fight. &gt;&gt; You have to grab this flesh and humble it &gt;&gt; under the word of God &gt;&gt; and it'll give you power. That's right. &gt;&gt; They have to unite together because it's not what you do. It's not what you say. It's what he says and what he does because he wants to prove every one of his words. And you are a word in this age that you have to be expressed. But you have to receive it by faith. &gt;&gt; And when you receive it, you have to take an action inside of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what your inheritance is? Amen. Have you read the will of your father? &gt;&gt; Have you gotten there to read the book? &gt;&gt; Have you gotten there? Have you gotten there to read that name that was written about you? BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU read in the message or in the Bible, YOU READ ABOUT YOU. YOU READ ABOUT what how God created you. How God manifested his love in you. And you SEE YOURSELF IN DAVID and you see yourself in in in Amen. You see yourself in Samuel. YOU SEE YOURSELF IN the disciples. YOU SEE YOURSELF THROUGH ALL THESE ALL THESE CHARACTERS that God had left in the scripture. Amen. BUT ALL THAT DID was that testimony was influencing you &gt;&gt; because these are testimonies of the living saint. It's the living God, right? Because Abraham didn't have a Bible. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Or Noah didn't have a Bible. He had a plan to build build an ark. But Noah witnessed the pyramid which was a Bible because and Enoch the seventh from Adam. He was the one that was the constructor of the pyramid and and he was the one that built it in his days. And and after Noah I mean was taken away then I apologize. After Enoch was taken away then Noah started in his in his ministry of building an ark and preaching the gospel 120 years. And it was God that after 120 years had shut the door. &gt;&gt; 120 years and seven days, God shut the door and the grace was shut and it was just Noah and his family. &gt;&gt; And so I just want to bring this to your remembrance this morning. Amen. I'm not saying it is, but could it be? We have to be we have to be aware of these things. 1906, 2026, 120 years. Noah preached 120 years. And as it was in the days of Noah, &gt;&gt; so shall it be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; Prophecies are being filled before you. You have to be up to date with what God is doing. &gt;&gt; You have to be living inside this word every day of your life because in in one day, he will change you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I mean, HE'LL CHANGE YOU IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE HERE. You'll just wake up on the other side. Amen. It was it was the overcome overcoming of this age was death. That was what was overcome in this age was death. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Revelations 13:es 8 and 9, I just want to read these two verses because the beast and the spirit of antichrist is trying to come trying to come and deceive the very elect that if it'd be possible. &gt;&gt; So, he's trying to come your way to deceive you. Amen. and with mistruths, with false doctrines, with misinterpret word, right? I mean, it it's out there. I apologize. Maybe maybe I'm the only one that kind of is aware of that, but the Bible says that they'll come fight false Christ. &gt;&gt; And it says you it says low one here, low one here, there's one here. Amen. And the only way that you know a tree is by its word and what comes out of him. &gt;&gt; And so, you have to know the word for you to be able to discern the word that comes from someone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a a PERSON'S KNOWN BY HIS CHARACTER, BY THE WORD THAT COMES OUT of him. And so you you WANT TO BE TRAINED. YOU want to be uh Amen. You want to be in season for this time that we're living in because the devil's trying to deceive the very ELECT IF IT'D BE POSSIBLE. BUT IT'S NOT possible &gt;&gt; because he's done something to you that you cannot be deceived. That's right. &gt;&gt; All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him. And all that dwell upon this is talking about the mark of the beast. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the lamb's book of in the book of in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. Now, we know that Revelations 13, the prophet clearly describes that this is America. It's 13 stripes, 13 stars, 13 colonies, how we got started. And and it it's just interesting how in 1950, I believe in 1954, I know we all know the quote, the prophet talks about the pope coming out of United States and it nine months later, the pope was born September. So he preaches this 1954 December and in 1955 September this pope was born in Chicago. You you understand I'm I'm not saying anything. All I'm saying is that God fulfills his word at the right time. &gt;&gt; And we have to be activated in our promises and our benefits and our inheritance to be able to overcome and deceive the devil. You have to be armed at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this the devil, the affluence of this age is coming with so much pressure against you. &gt;&gt; And and you have to you you have to Amen. YOU HAVE TO SURPASS THIS PRESSURE. YOU HAVE TO RESIST THIS PRESSURE THAT COMES AGAINST YOU. IF NOT, AMEN. IF WE CANNOT RESIST THIS PRESSURE THAT COMES AGAINST US, OH LORD, DON'T LET ME FALL AWAY. LET ME be let ME BE PROPERLY TRAINED TO SURVIVE THIS PRESSURE THAT WANTS TO COME AGAINST US &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S TRULY a squeeze. IT SQUEEZES SOMETHING OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; IT REALLY DOES. It does something to you. &gt;&gt; But if you live in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, you won't even feel anything of this world. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to live in that inner room. That's why you have to live in that tent. That's why you have to live in a place, amen, where nothing would ever bother YOU. YOU WALK OUT, YOU WALK OUT OF THAT PLACE AND you are a son and daughter of God with authority over you, where you can cast out devils, &gt;&gt; right? Where you can speak the WORD OF GOD AND NOTHING WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND before it. &gt;&gt; The angel told the prophet this, if you can get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; he could have said if you could get the people to believe Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; he could have said you if you can get the people to believe. No, but he said if you can get the people to believe you. Now, I listened to the prophet for a few years now and all I hear the prophet preaching is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So, if you can get the people to believe you, nothing shall stand before you. Not even cancer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not even spiritual cancer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because we're living in the day of of cancer. And a cancer is an attachment of life that tries to come upon YOU AND SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF YOU. I mean extract the life out of you and get you into a stage where you have no life. But the WORD OF GOD EVEN CLEANS THAT UP. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; NOTHING SHOULD STAND AGAINST YOU. IF GOD IS FOR YOU, NO ONE COULD COME AGAINST YOU. NOT EVEN CANCER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN CANCER. WHY? Because he created you. He's done something to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So let me ask you this. When Egypt was receiving all the plagues, when Moses was reading and he was given all the plagues by the power of the word, there was a people that God had chosen in Goan that not even their animals were touched. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God elected them. &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing touched them. &gt;&gt; 10 plagues, last one was killing their firstborn. Nothing touched them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God had a will. And his will said, "My children will be protected. My bride won't suffer. My bride is raptured. My bride is already with me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR UNITING PLACE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM. They're they're uniting. This is the union right NOW BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM. WHEN WE LEAVE THIS PLACE, WE'RE GOING INTO A MILLENNIUM, MY brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to I mean I I I WANT TO REST WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE. I WANT TO ENTER INTO THE DAY of rest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; WHERE IT'S NOT MY WILL, LORD, but it's your will, Lord. &gt;&gt; And let him carry you, not you carry him. &gt;&gt; You're not holding on to him anyways. &gt;&gt; It's him holding on to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you're in the bosom of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So if he loved you, he'll carry you all the way through. &gt;&gt; The process is trusting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Trust him. &gt;&gt; Now, the bride won't be deceived &gt;&gt; because she'll recognize her position &gt;&gt; and what she'll stand for. &gt;&gt; And nothing &gt;&gt; can stand before you. &gt;&gt; I mean, not even death, not even death can stand before you. Do you do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we overcomers here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let it just be on your lips. Let it let it ring in your life. Amen. where it produces such an atmosphere inside of you. Amen. Where nobody I mean NO DEVIL COULD GET NEAR YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Where they CAN RUN AWAY BEFORE THEY EVEN COME TOUCH YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. JESUS CHRIST. JESUS CHRIST STOOD ONE TIME BEFORE A DEMON. And the demon was crying BEFORE HE SAYS, "NO, don't [laughter] &gt;&gt; let ME SAVE ME. SAVE ME. THROW IT IN THE PIGS. He did &gt;&gt; and they ended up going and killing themselves in the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing shall stand before the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because she knows her position &gt;&gt; and it's not your authority to begin with. It's his authority in your life. &gt;&gt; That's what stands for you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's his authority. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963. The mystery of his will. He has a will for you. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have to go and get your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You have to get to to live this inheritance that he has left for you. Amen. I know it. I know. I know. We We probably hear the gospel so much. Think about it. You know, sometimes we could be overfed. &gt;&gt; And you know what happens when you're eagle and you're overfed? You can't fly. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't fly if you're overfed. If you're so full, the body is not made in such a way. You can't fly. And if if you did, you'd be very low and maybe unbalanced somehow because you don't you're not used to this weight upon you and you don't know how you know you don't know your wings, how how they con I mean, think about it. But when you when you eat good, when you eat vitamins, because the prophet says that every promise in his word is like a vitamin. Hallelujah. I need more vitamin C. I need more vitamin Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. I need more vitamin of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need more vitamin maybe healing in my body. I need MORE VITAMINS OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH IN MY LIFE. HALLELUJAH. I NEED VITAMINS IN MY LIFE SO MY LIFE CAN PROVE THAT I'M A HEALTHY BELIEVER IN THIS MESSAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS MESSAGE BEING DISGRACED. I APOLOGIZE. THIS LIFE IS A HOLY LIFE THAT THIS PROPHET HAD RESTORED. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A JOKE. &gt;&gt; IT'S A REAL THING, MY BROTHER AND SISTER. AND I PROMISE YOU, YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, IT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'LL MAKE YOU A NEW CREATURE IN JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; IT'LL CHANGE YOUR ABILITIES. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR DECISIONS. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR WANTS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'LL IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING THAT YOU have because now you have a filter. &gt;&gt; Run it through the filter. &gt;&gt; Run it through the filter. If it's not run by the filter, be careful because you're standing on a word of a man. and every word of man because heavens and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away. Amen. &gt;&gt; His word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; His word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; Testimonies, my healing, all of these things that happened here upon this earth that gave me a temporary walk with the Lord, all of these will pass away. And when we get to the other side, I'm gonna ask Abraham, Abraham, how did you make it here? &gt;&gt; He's going to say, Cosman, by grace. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that I did. &gt;&gt; It was all by grace. When the angel came and gave me the promise, he says, I'll bless your seed. Now, it didn't say, "Well, you know, sometimes it's going to be tough or No, he says, I'll bless your seed &gt;&gt; and out of you, it's going to be like the sands of the it's going to be like the grains of the sand and the stars and the I mean, it's going to be a seed of faith. &gt;&gt; Abraham's seed. Amen. It's by grace. It's by faith, my brother and sister. 1963, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Christ is living through you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So pregnant with his spirit that you are a prisoner to anything else. &gt;&gt; You're confined. &gt;&gt; Oh my. To the gospel, confined to the word. And all the children that you can bring forth is that cuz you're a prisoner. &gt;&gt; You can't commit adultery. You're already pregnant. &gt;&gt; So think about this. Amen. Just to try to keep it simple, when somebody's pregnantated and now the wound has been sealed, &gt;&gt; no one can go try to leave seed again and and conceive. It's done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once your life has been receiving the seed and has already united &gt;&gt; with your flesh, &gt;&gt; no one can come &gt;&gt; in you &gt;&gt; and deceive the seed that's already in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, what are you worried about? &gt;&gt; GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND IF YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS, GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH THE WORD BECAUSE HE'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. &gt;&gt; HE'LL LEAD YOU. HE'LL GUIDE YOU. HE'LL BE IN YOU UNTIL THE END. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; GLORY. HE CAN'T TAKE A HOLD. The womb of life is closed to anything else. You're already HIS BY PREDESTINATION. &gt;&gt; THAT SEED has to come to life. &gt;&gt; No world CAN GET IN. OH, HOW WOULD WE'D LIKE TO STAY ON this for an hour and I'm sure you understand. See, Christ and his alone already finished. The the seed was there. The seed was already when was it put there? Before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; has predestinated us to eternal life. &gt;&gt; So when God pregnant you, he pregnant you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You didn't get saved now. You were always saved. &gt;&gt; You were always saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you were born with this nature. &gt;&gt; And God had to restore this nature that was inside of you. &gt;&gt; And as soon as life and as soon as the lifegiving flow, the seed laying there, other things that just wouldn't come in, it wouldn't take hold. Just couldn't do it. But when that seed come in quickly is stopped up the womb. All the rest of the seeds was drove out. See like that and you become a prisoner surrounded in Christ. Christ in you his life bringing forth his evidence. Hallelujah. his signs. Look, bring in his signs of life as an evident as an evident of his resurrection, proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that we're alive in him. &gt;&gt; That's why you're resurrected now. &gt;&gt; What did you resurrect? Your &gt;&gt; theophony. &gt;&gt; That's what you brought to life. &gt;&gt; That's right. your subconscience has now woken up your conscience, your true conscience. And so now when you find the Jacob, not the Esau, because this these two will always be twins. You have an Esau and you have a Jacob. And only Jacob was able to have a name change, but this Esau sold his life, his proper birthright for a a bowl, a soup, a bowl. Oh, excuse me. A bowl of soup. I'm my Romanian is kicking in. So think about it. This Esau will sell his life &gt;&gt; for a bowl of soup. &gt;&gt; But Jacob had to wrestle with the angel to get a name change. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE WANTED THAT THAT BIRTHRIGHT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE KNEW THAT IF HE CAN BE THE FIRSTBORN, he has access to all the inheritance. Hallelujah. AND IT WOULD BE HIM THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE INHERITANCE. That's why it that's why this message is not a religion. &gt;&gt; It's a people. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a person. &gt;&gt; And God changed his name to Israel. &gt;&gt; And out of Jacob come the 12 tribes. &gt;&gt; That's it's a people. &gt;&gt; It's not a religion. &gt;&gt; And God's calling you personally. This is not a group thing. &gt;&gt; People want to make it a group thing. It's not a group thing. &gt;&gt; People in the world do group things &gt;&gt; because they want to unite &gt;&gt; and they want to have followers and influencers and they say, "Oh, look at us." And all of this, but God is not dealing with groups anymore. That's already been done. &gt;&gt; The last time God did that was through Malachi 4:5 and it was to bring a message. It was to restore it all and force. I mean, it was it nothing else is coming after this. the the next thing that's coming is going to be Moses and Elijah, the two olive trees that have to go to Israel. But for us Gentiles, it's over. We now we have to come to MATURITY AND FULFILL THE PROMISE THAT'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO COME TO THAT RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WAS GIVEN TO ABRAHAM WAS RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE LOOKED AT the theophony, he said, "Oh, I want to be like him." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that was the life that was put before us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When he looked at me, he says, "Oh, okay. This is the promise you're going to give me. &gt;&gt; I'm 90 years old. I don't know how I'm going to get this kid, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to believe that by your word, you're going to change this body. You're going to make me young again. Even though I'm dead, somehow you're going to give me seed &gt;&gt; and somehow you're going to produce Isaac." Hallelujah. And out of Isaac came Israel. Hallelujah. SO GOD PREPARED ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He prepared Abraham. Now I want to grab your attention here for just a second. What happened in the tent? Look at the attitude of Sarah. So the promise is coming. Okay, let this let this question be in your mind. What happened in the tent? What really happened in the tent? Because Sarah was the wife of Abraham and the promise came to Sarah that she'll conceive, right? Because Abraham he Abraham already knew he already welcomed the Lord in the home. He's already served them and there was three angels, right? And so he's s he's welcoming he's welcome welcoming them in, right? And and so all of a sudden here comes Melazdc and is discerning Sarah's heart and is giving her the promise in the tent as the prophet says. She was washing dishes or whatever she was doing in there. She was getting things ready and all of a sudden she didn't laugh out loud. &gt;&gt; But she disbelieved the word. &gt;&gt; Huh? Me an old woman to have a child. &gt;&gt; Now think about it because that was the word. That was the faith that came to Abraham. So what did he do in the tent? He discerned her heart and he gave her the promise. What does God do in your tent? He discerns your heart and he gives you the promise. The same thing. Where did Isaac take Rebecca? He took her into Sarah's and they conceived the son. See everything happens in the intimacy between you and the Lord. That's why it's in individual walk. &gt;&gt; You can hide yourself in the group. Very good. &gt;&gt; And you could be a very religious person, really nice dressed in a suit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Dressed in a nice beautiful skirt with your hair beautifully put out. Amen. You can be so holy. You can be so kind, &gt;&gt; but if you're not sealed by the Holy Ghost, be careful &gt;&gt; because you're walking a dangerous line. &gt;&gt; You want to have the blood of Jesus Christ seal sealing you. Not only interior of your home, but on the exterior of your home. So when you walk and you come in, you know what's covering you. &gt;&gt; There's only one blood that would be able to cleanse you from all unbelief, and that's the blood OF JESUS CHRIST. APPLY THE BLOOD. DON'T JUST KEEP it or JUST HAVE IT. APPLY IT IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WILL SAVE YOU FROM THIS WORLD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WILL CLEANSE YOU from this world. But that's the hardest part. We we know too much. We're living in the age of artificial intelligence. AI. A a I don't know how they come up with those names, but you know, uh they want they they don't want you to think for yourself. They they want to think for you. They want to tell you what to do. You no longer make the apple cake this way. You can do this and do this and do this. But my grandma taught me this way. &gt;&gt; It was it was because there was love that was in it when my grandma made it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And she put effort into making the pie. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. Because my grandma, she loved cooking. And so she gave me the recipe and she says, "Sister Holly, when you do a cake for brother, I I don't I'm not good at baking, but but you know, I'm just I'm just drawing a point so you understand. &gt;&gt; We no longer depend on the on on the living word of the of the living God. And we're dependent on what somebody else is telling me." But really, IT'S WHAT THE WORD SAYS, my brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Really, it's the it's it's THE WAY THAT GOD HAD COOKED IT FOR YOU. I MEAN, HE'S ALREADY PREPARED A SEVEN COURSE MEAL FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You just HAVE TO GO ENJOY IT AND READ YOUR INHERITANCE, RECEIVE THAT INHERITANCE THAT GOD gave you and this will. Amen. And and it's not sometimes it's hard to fight against the flesh to settle this flesh down, just to be able to read a verse in the Bible just to be able to like sometimes, you know, you could be so disoriented. You could run around all day and you read a chapter like, "Lord, I don't even understand what I read. &gt;&gt; I just did it just so I don't feel bad. because there's so much pressure. &gt;&gt; There's so much going on. &gt;&gt; But get on your knees first. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cry out to God. &gt;&gt; Have him change the condition that's IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; GET UP, &gt;&gt; READ YOUR SCRIPTURE, and you'll see the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. BECAUSE NOW YOU YOU GOT YOURSELF UNDER THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HOLY GHOST TO TALK TO YOU, TO SPEAK TO YOU. AMEN. WE HAVE TO HAVE RESPECT FOR THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WAS A RESPECTOR OF HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, HE CAME DOWN JESUS HIMSELF AND RESPECTED HIS OWN WORD. Humbled himself as a son of man. Didn't have a place to lay his head, but he lived the life of a son of God. &gt;&gt; And that's our calling. That's our election. I want to strengthen you in your calling on your election. Before you had a position in the church, first you had to be a son. &gt;&gt; You can be the best song leader you want. You can be the best preacher you want. &gt;&gt; You can be the best deacon you want. &gt;&gt; But be before God put you there, he made you a son first. &gt;&gt; Their inheritance is the sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gifts and calling come without repentance and they'll be left behind. But his word, &gt;&gt; the inheritance will always stand, my brother and sister. &gt;&gt; And find yourself your find your election. FIND YOUR FIND YOUR WORD. FIND WHAT GOD WROTE ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF GOD CALLED YOU HOLY, BE HOLY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS TO GIVE YOU LOVE, BE LOVE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE CREATED YOU TO BE. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] think of it alive with God, our redeemer, who created us for the very same purpose, the church, and his creative life in us. That is Moses. Moses. Moses said, "By the word of God, let there come and there come flies." A God that can make flies can make squirrels. You guys believe that? &gt;&gt; God giving you the power of the spoken word. Now, it's not like uh let it be a car. &gt;&gt; I'm It's It's strange out there. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; I've been around it. &gt;&gt; I've been around it. I preach I preached around it. And God doesn't do that. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. When brother Brana was with Hatty Wright, &gt;&gt; what he told her was the testimony of the speak of the creation of the scrolls into existence. &gt;&gt; And you know what the response of Hadty Wright was? It's nothing but the truth. In that moment when she recognized that the son of God was living the life, he says the presence came in that room and he says ask anything. &gt;&gt; He felt it. He knew it. And now it was her inheritance. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; She had to had respect for the word of God for the promise to come forth. &gt;&gt; So ask for a million dollars. Your sister's in the wheelchair. She needs healing. She could have done it. She was suffering. &gt;&gt; She was in bad pain. But no, she had something on her mind. &gt;&gt; And that was the souls of her sons. &gt;&gt; Now, if a word like that could do something for had it right, can it not do it for you? &gt;&gt; And she was a sister. Now sisters, &gt;&gt; where's your faith? &gt;&gt; And she was a sister, &gt;&gt; but she recognized the promise &gt;&gt; and SHE SAID, "LORD, NOT MY WILL, BUT LET YOUR WILL BE DONE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT PROMISE CAME TO FULFILLMENT BECAUSE SHE PUT HER TRUST IN JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; SHE PUT HER TRUST IN THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now listen for paragraph 470. He can do whatever he wants to. He can create. He can do anything. He's God. The very same God that created life. You see that's in you. You're a prisoner. You can't speak it till he says speak it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So first he's got to you got to get it from him. &gt;&gt; And it Moses didn't do it out of his own will. Moses heard the word of God. God told him what to do. And when he went before Pharaoh, he had the word of the Lord in front of Pharaoh. And it was the word of God in front of Pharaoh that gave him authority. The fleece shall come if you don't let my people go. &gt;&gt; The frogs will come if you don't let my people go. Now, when he left there, it didn't happen right away. And Pharaoh, I'm sure, probably was just talking in the background. Well, again, this Moses, who does he think he is being able to do all these things? But you see, Janice and Jambers couldn't do that, &gt;&gt; the impersonator. &gt;&gt; But Moses did &gt;&gt; because it because Pharaoh had access to Jan Janice and Jambers and he could have told them, "Hey, stop the fleas." But they couldn't do that. They didn't have power of they didn't have the power of creation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was just a perverted. They can do they can throw their stick and throw it into a snake and do all these all these other things you know that you can impersonate. But the word they couldn't do that. &gt;&gt; They had no access to that. &gt;&gt; But you know the access that was given TO THE BRIDE WAS THE WORD OF GOD WAS THE SPEAKING OF THE WORD MY BROTHER AND SISTER. Wasn't that what Revelations 89 and 10 says? Revelations 10. After you eat the book, what do you do? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A CONDITION, LET YOUR FAITH COME FORTH. DRAW FROM I MEAN DRAW FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT, DRAW FROM THE BENEFITS THAT'S YOURS AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE 25 CENTS IN YOUR POCKET. AMEN. USE IT BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST LIKE BUYING A LOAF OF BREAD. &gt;&gt; LORD, you said it. I didn't say I'm just I just want to be faithful to your word. Your word says that by your stripes I'm healed. &gt;&gt; It don't matter how I feel. By your stripes I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF I'M WORSE. By your stripes I'm healed. AND EVEN IF I DON'T GET HEALED, I'M STILL HEALED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. WHY? &gt;&gt; NOW I GOT HEALED for eternity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't lose with God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T LOSE WITH GOD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF GOD IS FOR YOU, &gt;&gt; WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Don't depend on your own abilities. &gt;&gt; Lucifer depended on his own his own abilities. He wanted to, you know, he wanted to be, he wanted to be like God. He wanted to have followers. And, you know, that's when the first battle had happened was in heaven. &gt;&gt; It was the battle of of proudness. &gt;&gt; It was it he considered he he served the creation more than the creator. be very careful because we're living in an age where the mark of the beast is really wanting to make the you, the fleshly you come more into the existence than the Jacob in you. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to humble yourself under the word of God. &gt;&gt; It wants to it wants to do a lot of things to you to make you feel good. It wants to give you a life where you don't depend on God anymore. Think about it. &gt;&gt; It wants to take all the abilities away to worship God anymore. I have a good job. Everything's all nice and dandy. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about praying for food anymore. The in in the old days, you know, uh when mo when Moses was trying to when when Moses was trying to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt, I'm we're going to close. I apologize. Um when when Moses was trying to bring the people out of out of Egypt into the promised land, the days the amount of days that God was allowing at the beginning to the process was 11 days. So Moses, God told Moses that in 11 days that they were going to try to make it to the promised land. It didn't take 11 days. It took 40 years. Now in the 40 years as they were coming out of Egypt going into the promised land, all of them were covered by the pillar of fire. All of them were covered by the cloud. All of them ate the mana that came from the wilderness. None of them had a need. If they did, Moses would remember the the brazen serpent. If if if the devil would come and and and invite one of the one of the believers into the camp, they would go to the brazen serpent and they would look at Calvary and they would know that as soon as you put your trust in Calvary, you would be healed. And they would they would there was no Amen. There was no there was no need. God was taking care of them. Amen. They were taking care of their homes. They were taking care of their shoes. They their shoes didn't wear out for 40 years. Man, give me some of those sneakers. I want to buy a pair and just wear it for 40 years. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Their clothes never wore out. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WASN'T THE PROCESS. That wasn't the inheritance. The inheritance was TO GO INTO THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; The inheritance was, "Okay, I see the pillar of fire. I see the cloud. Lord, I I know you're with us. I know I know that you're talking to us. I know I know these things. I've heard these things for 40 years. 40 years. I've heard this thing. I've heard this thing. I've heard this thing. But Moses was being persistent. WE GOT TO GO. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GO. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GO. AND ONE DAY THEY DID. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MOSES, JOSHUA BEING THE HOLY GHOST WENT AND TOOK HIM INSIDE. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; Moses made a mistake. And his mistake was instead of speaking to the rock, he lit the rock. And because of that, this he didn't listen to the will of God. So think about this. A prophet used by the Lord &gt;&gt; and disobeying one word and kept them away from the promised land &gt;&gt; took him up to the mountain says, "I'll show you, but you cannot enter in." Why? Because he used his flesh in a moment he shouldn't have used his flesh. But Joshua was a follower of the message. &gt;&gt; Joshua was always next to Moses. &gt;&gt; He was always He was always next Moses. What do we do? How can I help you? Moses. Amen. It was Joshua. It was the Holy Ghost. Amen. And And Joshua and Caleb was the ones that entered into the promised land. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, here's Moses. He comes off the scene and Joshua and Joshua and the group I believe if I'm not mistaken is Joshua chapter Joshua chapter 3 and Joshua the prophet says represents Ephesians. You know he was coming out of Exodus and going into the promised land and is showing the process of what it's like to get into the promised land. But even though these two million believers that were walking with Moses for 40 years, they missed something. There was something they missed that should have been done. They got comfortable because God was taking care of their needs so much &gt;&gt; that they forgot they forgot to do the most important thing in their life. &gt;&gt; May I not be that this morning? I don't want to be just a drag alonger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be just somebody drag me along just just, hey, come to church. Okay, fine. I'm just going to come sit down and see what the minister is going to what brother Billy's going to preach this morning. Oh, he preached about me again. and I don't like him. &gt;&gt; He spoke about me. Well, why does these preachers always have to speak about me? &gt;&gt; Well, maybe God's calling you. &gt;&gt; Maybe God's correcting you. &gt;&gt; Maybe God's doing SOMETHING TO YOUR HEART. YOUR ATTITUDE, THE WAY THAT YOU RECEIVE the word matters. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU HAVE MARY HAD A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, LORD, how this this in my life is going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Sarah the same way. even though she rushed. I don't know how this is GOING TO COME TO PASS. JESUS CHRIST IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE, I DON'T KNOW, LORD, IF SOMEHOW YOU CAN GET THIS CUP TO JUST PASS AWAY FROM ME. IT'S TOO HARD. But it's not my will. Let your will be done, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want your will to be done. I want you to be the center of my life. I WANT YOU TO BE THE LEADER OF MY LIFE. I WANT YOU TO BE THE VERY PRESENCE IN MY LIFE THAT CARRIES ME THROUGH EVERY PROBLEM, EVERY SITUATION, EVERY SICKNESS. Because when you walk with him, it all changes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's like an excursion. How how do you say this? Uh when you go on a is like a guide, like an excursion, right? Does that make sense when I say that? &gt;&gt; An excursion. When you go and he takes you around, it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Regardless if it's the mountains and the valleys, when you're with him, it's the best vacation you could ever take. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he knows exactly what you like. That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows where to take you. He know He knows you. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HE KNOW HE KNOWS THAT. HE KNOWS YOUR EYES. He knows your ears. He knows your thoughts. He knows your He knows what you like to eat. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. HE'S INFINITE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, YOU CAN'T HIDE AWAY FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE AWAY from God. You know when you hide away from God? Adam hid away from God when he sinned. Right. &gt;&gt; But who told you, Adam? Well, you know, I'm going to pass the blame and the blame is going to pass the blame and the blame is going to pass the blame. No, we have to be sons and daughters of God redeemed by this message of the hour. My brother and sister, this is our calling and election is not just to know the message, but to be resurrected in the message &gt;&gt; because this message is a resurrection. Now if you turn to Joshua chapter 5 just for a few moments. So remember they they they were walking with the message 40 years and they were benefited by every promise that God had given them. Moses was their leader. The message was their leader. He was taking care of everything they had need of. But they forgot to do something. And I want to read it this morning because Amen. It's very important. It's very important that we don't ever forget to do this. And this is the cause. Verse chapter verse verse four. Joshua 5:4. And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise. So one thing they didn't do in the wilderness for 40 years is they never circumcised. They never circumcised the people. They benefited from all the blessings. They benefited from the pillar of fire. They benefited from the cloud. But they never were circumcised. And so Joshua is now using the 12 Levites, the 12 priests, and he's opening the Jordan, right? Because they're carrying the ark of the covenant. They're trying to cross into the promised land. And by faith, they're stepping into this Jordan. Waters coming apart. Amen. And here's the priest standing there as the waters are being separated. All the believers are walking in. And remember, it was the priest that was stood last until the last one walked in. &gt;&gt; And then they walked behind them &gt;&gt; because it was the ark of the covenant that they were carrying over their hearts that mattered the way that that water was going to be able to open up and enter into the promised land. So they get into this promised land and listen and all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all men of war died in the w died died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt. Now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised. For this, listen verse six. For the children OF ISRAEL WALKED 40 YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord, unto whom the Lord swore by he would not show them the land which the Lord swore unto their fathers, that he would give us a land that flowth with milk and honey, and the children whom he raised up in theirstead, THEM JOSHUA circumcised &gt;&gt; for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way. And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole. And the Lord said to Joshua, now listen to this. This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. This day there had to be a day where Joshua the Holy Ghost had to recognize the heart of the believer that he was not circumcised and will come and circumcise your heart. Now listen, circumcision it's it hurts. &gt;&gt; The process of life hurts. &gt;&gt; It's not a breeze. &gt;&gt; It's surrendering all. &gt;&gt; Circumcision is not a pleasant. It's not. I apologize. &gt;&gt; And this was the Abrahamic covenant &gt;&gt; was to be circumcised. was to be cut around our heart, WAS TO BE ABLE TO LET GO OF ALL [screaming] THE THINGS THAT MIGHT WANT TO ATTACH TO US LIKE A GLUE AND BE CIRCUMCISED AROUND OUR [screaming] HEARTS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE I DON'T WANT TO BE A PERSON WALKING THROUGH THE wilderness because remember anytime God wants to take you in the promised land, he always takes you to a wilderness experience. Jesus Christ did it. He received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He went 40 days into the wilderness. And what happened? What what was the revelation he come out of it? It says man shall not live by bread alone but shall live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God. At that point Jesus Christ defeated the devil. &gt;&gt; And the HOLY GHOST WAS NOW UNITED because nothing can deceive him. His womb and the seed now pregnant and nothing could be able to deceive him. &gt;&gt; And you have to be the same way &gt;&gt; when that seed comes inside of you. Amen. Amen. No man, no other man seed could come inside your heart and deceive you. My brother and sister, you are not deceivable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your seed cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You are not deceivable, &gt;&gt; but you have to stand under the present word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You cannot be deceived. Right? Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that your name is written in the lamb's book of life? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he has called you specifically for this time for you to manifest Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the calling. He wants us to be like him. &gt;&gt; He wants us. He wants us to be like him. But this day, he rolled this reproach. My brother and sister, get circumcised around your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ask God for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because the the prophet said he wants to give it to you more than you want to receive it. &gt;&gt; But the problem is is your bless not clean &gt;&gt; because remember you have to go through the process of justification, &gt;&gt; sanctification. Right? Even though you were born with this nature inside of you, he has to do something to restore you. Not to bring something back or to create something new because no, he's to restore you. A a redeemer is restoring something back to where you were. &gt;&gt; He's not he's not change. He's not making something new. You already were what you were in the beginning. He's just restoring you to your condition. Listen to what the prophet says in identification 1964 paragraph 76. No other nature. Could you give me a few more minutes? God bless you. No other nature could do this. No other nature could. No character, nothing in heavens, nothing else could do that but him. For he was the beginning of that character savior. Now I want to ask you a question. What is greater? A sinner or a savior? What is greater sickness or a healer? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; These are the these are his attributes. So he allowed these things to be so you can see his attributes &gt;&gt; because you are his attributes. Jehovah Rafa, Jehovah, Jehovah. Those are the seven attributes of Jesus Christ that are living inside of you. And there's seven by the way. And they live inside of you. They restore your life. They they they regenerate your life. Savior. The angel wasn't born a savior. He was created a being to worship God, not a savior. But in God was a savior. An ordinary man born of an ordinary woman couldn't be a savior because his nature is carnal. But it taken God himself. Amen. Hope you see it. Look, that was the expression to manifest such a character as that. Hallelujah. HE WANTED TO EXPRESS THE character for others. IT WAS A FALLEN CHARACTER. Nothing can save. Angels wasn't create created for such man. Man was a fallen character. &gt;&gt; How could this man look to show it's the ones that he thought of? He thoughts in the Christian of today. the thoughts before the foundation of the world. Now remember, man when he was born in sin, shaped in iniquity, comes to the world speaking lies. Is that right? There is nothing in him at all. So you see if he if he was in God's thoughts when you came when you come to the world, he's come in thoughts at the beginning to display his attributes. Do you follow me? Then Jesus came to break the clouds back so that attribute could be display itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He came TO MOVE THE CLOUDS back so you can SEE THE SUN. THE SUN WAS ALWAYS SITTING THERE. BUT SIN HAD NOW COVERED the sun. But he had to take away the clouds by the grace of God on Calvary. So now you can see him plainly. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In his word. His word was now no longer a man sitting in a letter, but now it was a living life. That's what came back to the disciples. &gt;&gt; It was a living word. It wasn't good enough that Peter and Paul, I mean, excuse me, Peter, John, and Matthew, and all the and and and and uh uh J, I believe, uh they they walked with the Lord. It wasn't it wasn't it wasn't how can I say this? Uh uh that wasn't the witnessing Jesus's Christ's ministry wasn't good enough. I mean it was good. They were able to see the son of man, but that wasn't the promise. That wasn't the inheritance. The inheritance was that I'll go and prepare a place for you that where I am, you can also be. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now when he came down, he came down into a believer's heart the same way that he was expressing HIMSELF IN JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. A MULTI-MEMBERED BODY, A BRIDE BODY THAT WOULD MANIFEST JESUS CHRIST IN THEIR TIME, IN THEIR AGE. &gt;&gt; I can't go live the days of Noah. I can't go back and live the days of Moses. But what I can do is fulfill the promise of this hour that God had written about me. &gt;&gt; Because this is about fulfilling the promise of this hour. And the promise of this hour is to go in a body change. THAT IS THE PROMISE OF THIS HOUR. I WANT MY BODY TO BE CHANGED. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS WORLD. THE SIN IN THIS WORLD, THE HATRED IN THIS WORLD, THE WORLD, THE WAY THE WORLD IS EXPRESSING ITSELF. THINK about it. &gt;&gt; SO, SO THE THEIR EXPRESSION has become so vulgar, SO OUTSPOKEN. A A SMALL PERCENTAGE of the WORLD IS CONTROLLING THE WHOLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HOW? Through their vocabulary, THE WAY THAT THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES. OH MY, HOW MUCH MORE THE CHILDREN OF GOD CLAIMING THE PROMISES OF THE HOUR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST being the same yesterday, today, and forever. HE'S NEVER changed &gt;&gt; and he'll never change. &gt;&gt; We change. &gt;&gt; Today I can be on fire. Tomorrow I can but he's never changes. &gt;&gt; The the scripture says that he's faithful. &gt;&gt; Faithful means he'll never let go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll never let go of you. If he gave brother Jerob, IF HE GAVE YOU A PROMISE, HE'LL NEVER LET GO OF YOU. BROTHER EMANUEL, if he EVER GAVE YOU A PROMISE, HE'LL NEVER LET GO OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, YOU GOT TO BE SAFE IN HIS ARMS. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE SAFE KNOWING THAT HE'S in control. &gt;&gt; God don't need man control. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God don't need man control. That's communism. &gt;&gt; I apologize. God, we need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; To get into the promised land, you need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost is a new life. &gt;&gt; It's no longer you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, I cannot say I have the Holy Ghost and go do all these things that may seem okay today. I I'm sorry &gt;&gt; because light and darkness will never be able to stay together. And the prophet would say, I I I I don't know, I believe it was in leadership or one of the services. He says, you can have the Holy Ghost all your life. I I'm sorry. I'm just repeating the words of the prophet. Let it let the Holy Ghost interpret this to your own heart. You can have the Holy Ghost all of your life and still be lost and go to hell. &gt;&gt; If the seed is not in you, &gt;&gt; Amen. We want the seed of God in our life. We want the word of God in our life. We want the word of God to be the the absolute in my life and your life. Amen. That's my desire this morning. Amen. For the Holy Ghost to LEAD US AND GUIDE US INTO TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. HALLELUJAH. I GOT TO BE A DOUBLE A DOUBLE- WINGED EAGLE. I cannot just fly with one. I have to have both my wings. If not, I'll just be flapping and I'll get tired and before I know it, I'm going to break my right wing. But he gave us two wings. Amen. So you CAN SOAR IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS. And if YOU THINK YOU'RE AN OLD EAGLE, REMEMBER THERE'S A PLACE OF REGENERATION EVEN FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO? GO INTO THE WILDERNESS. Spend a few days up there. Knock your beak against the rock and you'll get a new beak. YOU'LL GET NEW FEATHERS. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A YOU BECOME A NEW EAGLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE ATTRIBUTE THE GENE INSIDE THIS EAGLE WAS TO BE ABLE TO REGENERATE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can go up there, you pluck all your all your little things out of you. &gt;&gt; You just become a little skinless, you know, &gt;&gt; bird. &gt;&gt; Lord, am I even worthy? What's about me? Is it Is it really him? What What's going on? And all of a sudden, you see your feathers just start growing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you're keep you keep worrying. But he's growing on you. And he's growing on you. And he's growing on you. And he's growing on you. And the feathers are coming out. And your eagle. And now your claws are starting to become strong. And your beak is now being regenerated. Your eyesight is no longer a bad eyesight. Your eyesight now becomes a 2020 eyesight. Hallelujah. And once you come to your regeneration, what's the first thing YOU DO? YOU FLY, MY BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU ARE CREATED TO BE OUT OF THIS WORLD, NOT IN THIS WORLD. SO HIGH THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE SIN OF THIS WORLD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHERE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN EFFECT ON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO BE that way. WE HAVE TO LET GO OF THE THINGS OF THE WORLD AND CHOOSE Jesus Christ every moment of your life. &gt;&gt; He can help you in school. &gt;&gt; He can help you in school. &gt;&gt; I He helped me in school. However many classes I was able to do because I didn't I didn't like to read. I didn't like to study. And so Lord, are you going to help me take this test? F. You were too confident. You should have read some. Think about it. The flesh. But when you depended on him, Lord, I don't know. You know, you know what I need. &gt;&gt; Now it comes a sincere heart. &gt;&gt; Now it's no longer a show. Now is no longer a put on. Now it's you and God's sincerity. Lord, you know me. You know my vessel. You know what I can do. You know what I can't do. But I CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; I NEED YOU TO DO THIS FOR ME. &gt;&gt; And you'll see him come upon your life. And you'll SEE HIM COME MANIFEST HIMSELF IN YOUR LIFE. AND YOU'LL SAY, "OH, DAVE, you've been there all along." &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have to concentrate my vision back on you. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I just have to concentrate my vision just right on you because there's so much distraction. I don't want to walk in this wilderness and not be circumcised. &gt;&gt; I want to be circumcised in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because that's what will save you. That's the token. &gt;&gt; It's the token to make it to the other side. He's God expressed. He is God's expressed word. Nothing else could be manifested. The characters all had fallen. Then you see what did Jesus come to bring back those characters? No. No. They were born in sin shaped in iniquity. He came as a redeemer. Paragraph 78. And to redeem anything is TO BRING IT BACK. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So the only ones THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BACK IS THE ONES THAT WERE THERE IN THE BEGINNING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So you WERE THERE IN THE BEGINNING. AMEN. Bring it back. IT WAS GOD'S THOUGHT. YOU THINK little you, little me, no one in the world could take MY PLACE. NO ONE CAN take yours. &gt;&gt; You being a Christian and filled with the spirit. God and before the foundation of the world seen you and knowed every feature that you got. See, and Jesus come to bring you back. &gt;&gt; That was the inheritance. &gt;&gt; Okay, I have seed. I I planted this whole ground that have seed. Should we pluck them up yet, Lord? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Let them grow together. Let them grow together. Because if you pluck them up now, you'll pluck away my good seed. &gt;&gt; So, let them grow together. Just keep water in the ground. Just keep give keep giving them life. &gt;&gt; And so, they grew and they grew and they grew and they grew. And all of a sudden we come through through the through the leaf of the fruit and we we get through the body of the of the plant and all of a sudden we come to the shuck and we come to the seed. Now I want to ask you a question and I and I I want I I want you to to put it personal. What's more important, the shock or the seed? This flesh &gt;&gt; or the word of God? What do you do with the shuck? If I was to have a piece of corn, right, and then you have the shuck on top of a corn, for me to enjoy the corn, I would have to pull away the shuck. I mean, you can throw it away. You can burn it. You can do whatever you want with it, but that's the shuck. &gt;&gt; It has no has no use. &gt;&gt; It's already done its purpose. It's the past. &gt;&gt; But the whole purpose was to mature the &gt;&gt; seed. And we're living in the days of the seed. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've moved UP INTO THE OPENING OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NO LONGER IN THE SHOCK. NOW WE'RE IN THE SEED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN 63. THAT'S WHAT GOD DID IN ON MOUNT TRANSFIGURATION FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM. HE CAME AND HE OPENED THE BOOK. AND NOW THE BOOK WAS CALLING THE SEED. [screaming] PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; HE WAS CALLING YOU OUT OF DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS CALLING YOU OUT OF SIN. HE WAS CALLING YOU OUT OF BONDAGE. IT WAS THIS MESSAGE THAT WAS CALLING YOU FROM YOUR CONDITION TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW. IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET. IT WAS THE TRUMP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T LOSE THE focus because you have to keep the main thing. The main thing and the main thing of this hour is this message that will change you, my brother AND SISTER. THERE'S NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU WANT TO GET TO KNOW JESUS CHRIST? Get in the message. &gt;&gt; Do you want the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Eat the message. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be healed? &gt;&gt; EAT THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE MESSAGE DO? It gives you authority over the devil. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE IT WAS INSPIRED BY A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU RECEIVE A PROPHET IN THE NAME OF A PROPHET, &gt;&gt; YOU'LL RECEIVE A PROPHET'S REWARD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's a reward. It's your inheritance. It's you. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; It's you that Jesus Christ died for. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOU THAT HE CALLED. It's you that he elected. IT WAS YOU HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR. &gt;&gt; It was you, &gt;&gt; not somebody else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't you, you wouldn't be here this morning. &gt;&gt; But because he was you, &gt;&gt; he called you &gt;&gt; and he elected you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because arise and shine that light has come. &gt;&gt; It's upon you. Remember the vision of the tent. That vision had a few instances in there that so 1956 the prophet talks about the vision of the tent. It was the first time that the Lord gave it to him and he doesn't actually fulfill till 1963 which is seven years later. And so he he he he's showing them the fishing how remember you cannot teach Pentecostal baby supernatural things and he's showing them how to fish and he says that as he was has he he was in there fishing he was teaching them how to fish the first pool and the second pool and in the second pool he was saying to him hey when you fish this time he says you'll see you'll throw you'll throw your your fishing pole in your your lure thank you very much your lure you're going to throw your lure in the water. But you you understand, you just have to pull it really slowly. But listen, he says, as they're getting closer to the to the lure and they're wanting to eat, pull it a little harder so you can disturb the little fishes because it was the little fishes that was trying to eat, but I'm wanting to c he was wanting to catch a big fish. So the Lord is teaching him all this and this vision. And all of a sudden, he he gets caught up and he sees a vision of the tent. How many How many of you remember this? So he sees the vision a picture of the big tent. This you know this this the vision of the prophet contained of multiple things. And so he sees the vision of of a big tent. So all of a sudden he's like well maybe this is something that I have I have to go to Mexico and I have to go put these big tents and preach the gospel. Maybe the Lord's doing something. This is the prophet himself saying all this. And so uh uh then all of a sudden he he's talking about how the Lord was wanting them to to catch the big fish. Right? Remember the rainbow trout, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because this was the third pool. And it says, "Hey, in this third pool, don't pull so hard. &gt;&gt; You've already you've already got impersonators that are your first and second pool." &gt;&gt; So many impersonators in healings and all of these things that were happening. So many impersonators. But on this third pool, don't pull hard because this is only for the elect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is going to be a secret. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is going to be a secret. And then the Lord shows him this tent. And this tent, he says he was standing and the angel was standing right behind him and he's sitting he's sitting next to the tent. And he says, "I've I' I've noticed that all of a sudden the light that was upon me, now catch this. The light that was upon me now was no longer on me, but it was upon the tent. It was inside the tent." &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, there's a difference between the light and the angel." if if you can catch it because because now now the light was upon inside the tent and he says, "I'll meet you in there." &gt;&gt; And there was a there was a woman that was on cur curt crutches &gt;&gt; and she was sick and she she was wanting to get inside the room. Amen. And there was there there was a man there that was was telling everybody says, "Let's be reverent because there's a prayer line, right? People had a prayer line." I'm just describing to you briefly of of the vision of the prophet. But it says when that woman walked inside that tent, when she came on the other side, she was healed. &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT MAN WALKED INSIDE THAT TENT, WHEN HE WALKED OUT, HE was healed. So what happened in the tent? He discerned their situation, provided the deliverance, provided the word for their hour, and that was the intimate place that God called you to be in. &gt;&gt; Because it's not for it's not a public show. &gt;&gt; It's an intimate relationship between the wife and the husband. &gt;&gt; Now, it's between you and the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The mystery of his will. This is the inheritance that he had for you. If I can invite the musicians to come. If you have Ephesians, this is where the Lord inspire inspired me here. Ephesians chapter 1 verse one. The mystery of his will. He's called you for a purpose. He's called you. Amen. He's called you. Amen. With the with the vision because you have to have a vision. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a vision, you'll perish. &gt;&gt; You have to have a vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have God has to be your vision. Amen. And he's called you in this age because you are supposed to be the light of this age. And how can I be light, brother Cosman? How how is it that I can be light? What is it that I can do that I can become this light? Maybe it's so hard for me to put these things together. You know the scripture says if we walk in the light as he is in the light, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all unbelief. Amen. And and and and then you'll have fellowship. So walk in the light he as he is in the light. Amen. And then the blood of Jesus Christ shall cleanse you from all unbelief when you stay with the light. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Verse three, blessed be God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us all with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Now listen to verse four. according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be. How should you be? and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. God is not annoyed with you. God doesn't get annoyed. He has a pleasure &gt;&gt; in saving you. Think about it. He desires. He wants to. He longs for you to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom he have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will. having made unto you the his the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in all in one hallelujah all things in Christ hallelujah both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the pray that that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, in whom ye also trusted that after ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that hol Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believing sealed you into the Holy Ghost and the promise that G that was for you [music] which is the earnest hallelujah of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. Hallelujah. For him to redeem what he purchased. Now I'll tell you this. When he purchased you, he didn't purchase you halfway. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I'm gonna give a 50 50% deposit and then later on I'm going to give another 50% deposit." He didn't do it that way. When he redeemed you, he redeemed you whole. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He redeemed all of you. &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED EVERYTHING INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED YOU all &gt;&gt; because he came TO REDEEM A CHARACTER, MY BRIDE. AMEN. THIS IS YOU. THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT GOD IS DOING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT YOUR TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT YOUR VOICE BECAUSE YOU'RE THE LAST VOICE IN THIS LAST AGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT YOU. YOU HAVE TO TESTIFY OF THIS GOODNESS OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; If people can testify about their religion and how big their their parties are, so how big how big their services are, how much more we about the name of Jesus Christ in this generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we have a fountain full of water. We have a table full of food that you could eat at. Amen. God chose sons and daughters of God. And you know, nature is groaning. Okay. Nature's groaning for your manifestation. Nature is groaning for you to come to maturity because that's what called had what that's what God had called [music] a bride not only filled with the Holy Ghost but mature bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Let's just stand. If you haven't read your will, I want to inspire you this morning to go and go receive your will this morning because it was the inheritance is yours. God given you the the land. The land is yours. [music] Amen. The land is yours. The land was given to the overcomer. If you Revelation says, Amen. that to him that overcomemeth will I let or grant to sit with me on my throne even as I overcame Jesus Christ himself and sat with the father on the throne and god doesn't have a chair like a throne where he sits in heaven that's not that's not the that's not the throne his throne is dominion that's what he that's what was in the beginning and I'm not God has not restored us going back to Pentecost [music] I apologize Guys, you know where God has restored us to go back to? Back into the garden of Eden where the lamb and the lion can sit together. You know, Daniel, he was he he he he caught the mark of the beast. So here's Daniel, a prophet that made an image unto Daniel. They were worshiping Daniel. They couldn't find nothing against Daniel, right? And Daniel is a type of revelation. That's what the prophet says. [music] And so here's Daniel. They couldn't find nothing in Daniel. So what did they do? They came against his doctrine. Oh, well, we're going to write he's he's a righteous man. We have nothing to say about him. So now we're going to come against his doctrine. If you don't worship with this creature here, we're going to persecute you. Think about it. Because a time is coming where they're trying to have control. I don't know about here, but in Romania, it's starting to. They're wanting to have control. They're putting they're putting it publicly out there that if they hearing if they're hearing people amen marrying homosexual couples in their church or doing all these things there too, preaching about amen, preaching about politics or doing all these things, they have the right to come and close down your church. So the pressure is coming where it's now putting you to a test. You have to have that rapturing faith, my brother and sister. That's what he called us to be. And so Daniel, think about it. Because he didn't bow down to that God. He had the Holy Ghost. THE WORD WAS INSIDE of him. HE DIDN'T BOW DOWN TO THAT IMAGE. What did he do? They put him into a cage. They put him into a big hole, right? They put him into into this big place where he can be eaten by all these lions. But Daniel had dominion. He knew that God would save him. He knew that what was inside of him, the divine love. Now think about it because those those those lions didn't even feel hunger around Daniel. The presence of Daniel was so heavy inside that place that he had control over the lamb, over the lion. Hallelujah. It was that divine love. Let me tell you something. The prophet did the same thing, my brother and sister. He he bothered the bull. He restored Eden. He bothered a wops wops nest. He restored Eden. Amen. It was perfect love in the beginning. It was perfect love. It was it was a perfect world that God had created. Amen. And what happened? Daniel overcame because the angels was there with him. &gt;&gt; The love of God. You see what divine love. Amen. And divine love is blind. Divine love covers the multitude of sin. Divine love is God himself. And that's what he created you to be, divine love. Let's just bow our heads this [music] morning. Father, we so appreciate you this morning for your goodness. Oh, Father, I I I've only said what you've allowed me to say. I appreciate Lord that you were able to encourage us this morning, especially myself, knowing Lord that the will is the inheritance. And Father, you didn't call us to be bums in this world. [music] You didn't call us to beg for bread in this world. Father, Lord, you called us sons and daughters of God. You created us out of your own DNA. [music] You gave us Lord the most powerful tool that we can use and that's your word where we can overcome in a deceitful evil age. Father, oh Father, may you be able to quicken our hearts this morning. Oh Lord, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that oh my heart would be able to be full of joy and full of revelation, full of your truth, Father, full of of of of happiness, Lord. So when we leave this place, we know our calling and election and you've called us properly. Father, I pray that you bless your bride this morning. Father, I pray that you as they Lord, as we depart and go home and Lord, we go to our places, may your word just be able to rum rumigate or Lord, just be able to uh sit there and [music] just go through our minds and and quicken our hearts, Lord. Let it just be able to take root into our hearts and and put our lives, Lord, into the filter of this word and say, Lord, where am I with you today? What is my relationship with with you today? Oh Lord, and I want to tell you this morning, I want to get closer to you even this morning, Father, because you're eternal. You can never end, oh Lord, I can never have too much of you. Hallelujah. I can never have too much of you. I can never get too tired of you because you're eternal. Oh, and every time you discover yourself, every time you reveal yourself, it's always in love. And we appreciate that this morning, Father. Oh, Lord, we thank you for this opportunity I had this morning just to [music] Lord be here with the believers of Christian Life Tabernacle. May you continue to bless this sanctuary. May you believe, Lord, may you be able to bless the the bride of Christian Life Tabernacle. May you lead them, guide them, strengthen them, Lord Jesus. Unite them in this chain of love, Lord. Oh, may they be able to grow together, oh Lord, and and just get ripen under your son, Lord, because we are we are close that we are our time is close where you you're coming to take away a bribe. And that's my hope. That's my that's my faith, Lord Jesus, that one day two will be in the bed. You'll take one, you'll leave one. Two will be on the field, you'll take one, you'll leave one. Oh Lord, let us just be able to be ready like the working bride. Lord, that worked for you, Lord Jesus. We know that the prophet talks about it. All the sister denominationals were just getting pretty, oh Lord, and they were just trying to get ready for the king and and just thinking that this this is going to be them that oh Lord, that they they may inherit this, but no, you had a bride that was serving you day and night, Lord. And that's the one that he seen the character in her and he called her to be her wife. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, may our life be worthy of this gospel. We love you this morning. We appreciate you, Father. And we just commit Lord our lives in your hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's just sing this song as Brother Bill is coming. Amen. Are you happy this morning? the mystery of your will. Get to know your will. Amen. We'll walk in the light. [singing] Oh, beautiful [music] light. Blue drops of mercies are shine all around us by day [music and singing] and mighty God. Oh, and Jesus [music] the light of the world. Just sing it one more time this morning. [music] Oh, we walk in [music] the light. Beautiful. [music] Oh, and confess [singing] the due dies [music] [singing] and shine all [music] around us by day [singing] by night. Oh, and Jesus, [music] the light [singing] of the world. Sing it one more time this morning. Oh, we walk [music] in the light. Such a beautiful [music and singing] life. and come with [music] the new cross [singing] [music] shine all [music] around us by [singing] day and [music] by night. Oh, [singing] and Jesus is the light [music] of the world. Hallelujah. Amen. How many enjoy the word this morning? &gt;&gt; I I just want to ask you to just take a moment for what was spoken this morning and and just consider yourself and the mystery of his will as we heard. It's it's such a dark time as we heard and and but God yet God has made his word known unto us and and the question we have to ask ourselves is am I living at the potential of what's been made known unto me? He he's called me to be a son and a daughter and and he died for me so my sins could be taken away. Am I living by the provision that he's made for me? [music] We have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; And and and I think we we struggle in the world. We have all of these things going on. But the question is, are you living by the inheritance that is left for you? Don't let just just say, "Well, that was a good service. That was a good message." And go out and another service. The time is late. As we heard it, you know, we we it's not a guarantee that day in and day out we'll come and have another service and go home. And no, we we want to be ready. If this was my last service, I want to make sure I'm ready. &gt;&gt; I'm ready. I I I'm prepared and and the word of God is working in my heart and I have the Holy Spirit working in me. I I love what Alberto said. Bur says the Holy Spirit, it says the new birth is that personal revelation to you when you and him become one. &gt;&gt; Let's not just be another service. We we running out of time and we we want to we coming to the end and and if the word was sent to give us rapturing faith, we want to make sure we have rapturing faith today, not tomorrow, this service, this morning. God, I need that rapturing faith. And God, my life is not right. I want my life to be right today. Father, I'm struggling with this. I want you to help me with that today. Uh we we keep postponing. And that's, let me say this, that's the enemy that's doing that. Oh yeah, maybe tomorrow I'll get better. MAYBE. NO, THERE'S NO TOMORROW. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE FOR TOMORROW. All we got is this morning is today. And my question to us this morning is the word working and producing what is supposed to produce in me? &gt;&gt; We heard it in the Exodus. He provided a way and and they had the the food and THEY SAW SO MUCH supernatural &gt;&gt; until it just became common. &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SUPERNATURAL, SO MUCH WORD. AND and and the the same people, God looked at them and they said, "This will not inherit." They had to die in the wilderness. Another group had to come up so they can cross over. all of that because they failed to realize it was the grace of God that was walking them through. &gt;&gt; But Ram says we are invited. He was the only CHARACTER THAT COULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; We just read it and he says we are invited to shape our character to his. &gt;&gt; Are we shaping our character? Is the word having any effect on us at all? It it's just this a good sermon that we take notes and we go and we keep it where we put our notes at. &gt;&gt; It's just it's just as a good subject to go and study and find out. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's got to become life. &gt;&gt; It's got to [music] change our walk. It's got to change our attitude. It's got to have an effect on us. It's got to change the way we look, the way we talk. If if Christ is manifested again, it's the same life. It's not a different life. IT WOULD SHOW THE SAME MANIFESTATION BY THE SAME FRUIT. And if we not, he's inviting us this morning is for us to say, "Father, I this is the greatest message that's ever touched the face of the earth. And and my desire this morning is by your grace, not by my strength, not by MY WILL, NOT BY ANYTHING I can offer. Let it be by your grace this morning that that word may become a reality in my life. If if you open my eyes to see this, if you you open my eyes for me to know and see this things, there's got to be a way for me to become what I see. &gt;&gt; I just don't want to see it and not become it. I &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is the hour of the falling away. &gt;&gt; This is the hour where instead of life being drawn, it's the word that stays in the water and it's rotting where life is around it. And and we got to be careful. We got to look and we got to shake ourselves. We got to make sure that [music] whatever is happening that we are being affected by the word of God. It's [music] changing us day by day. our fellowship with him is growing. Not our fellowship with the pastor, not our fellowshipping with the church and everybody else and all that. That's wonderful. But the fellowship with him &gt;&gt; is your love growing in my heart. A am I desiring this? Is the life changing in me? Am I growing? Am I coming [music] into that image of that perfect son that we heard which was Jesus Christ? you yourself manifested in the flesh. If that's your heart desire, why don't you just lift your hand after him and and if you need prayer this morning, just come and you'll be prayed for. I I I just my heart is just swelling up because we hear this and I'm like, am I hearing too much of this where it's becoming common? If it is, Lord, help me this morning. But Father, I I I don't want to walk out the same way I came in. And and and I just want something to happen in my life, Lord, that your Holy Spirit will quicken what we just heard that we know it's a reality that we can go out there not just to people with the knowledge in the head, but we become people with the life being put on display. Help us, Lord, this morning. And our gracious father, we're so thankful for your word that was spoken. Lord Jesus, you haven't changed you the same yesterday, today, and forever. Father, if we heard your word this morning and that which is calling us to be perfect as our father in heaven is perfect. Lord, you couldn't call unless you provided a way for perfection. Lord, if you called us to be sons and daughters manifesting the word, you couldn't call us unless you're manifesting, [music] you going to manifest that which you called us for. Lord, help us learn to be prisoners to you, oh God. And father, help us to forget about ourselves and and what we got, our programs. And it didn't go this way. It didn't go that way. But Father, that we may cling only to you through your word and let it feed us and and that we may become that which you have spoken, Lord. And Father, that we may never fail to understand that each way, each time we step in this building is an opportunity for a change of life. and and and that you are here making your word a reality and and Father speaking to us that we can get ready for the for the for the rapture that is around the corner. FATHER, LET US NOT JUST GET ACCUSTOMED TO THE THINGS that we do, but we may understand that this is a preparing time. Help us, Lord, and lead us, oh God, and and if there be any need in the building, Lord, you you're the great Jehovah. The seven redemptive names belong to you. &gt;&gt; There's no need here that escapes you, Lord. And &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you even raise up our pastor this morning and just give him strength, oh God. And Father, renew his youth once again. And Father, just give him many more years to come. And Father, sharpen his mind, his body, and everything that he may serve you even more, Lord. And we commit all that we are to you because you promise that you yourself, you are the living word. And and father, you said that Jesus Christ is the revealed word of the hour and you here, Father, to make yourself a reality to the believer. We ask that you do that. Give it according to your will and way. We commit it to you in Jesus name we pray. Amen. All there are to [singing] roll. All you may take [music] one by side and one. Oh, and take the word of God. [music] Oh, what you see, what [music] you believe. Oh, and is what [singing] will be on and set [music] your wings to the wings of faith. Oh [music and singing] my heart.
