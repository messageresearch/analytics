Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Br. David McGeary
August 14, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

hand in jesus name we pray amen amen good to be gathering his presence this morning wanna welcome everyone and i trust you're excited to be here this morning all that visitors we welcome you you can turn around and welcome someone is invited by the mic for our psalm reading good morning go ahead and turn over to psalm 119 again this morning i'm going to pick up in verse 121 and so is reading that this week i could not get past the first five verses there's just so much in there but that verse and that kind of starts out the section it says this it says i have done justice and judgment and justice leave me not to mine oppressors i have done not had and it's justice and judgment together not just justice not just judgment but justice plus judgment i have done you know i thought that was an unusual statement you know and judgment and justice are not the same thing you know that word justice means to make right or made right just impartial equity everything placed in its rightful place the word judgment means a verdict a decision a declaration good or bad something or someone given its proper identification so one has to do with position the other has to do with identification judgment i have done justice and judgment you know i was thinking about that and another scripture came to mind it was in psalm 89 14. and as we're looking at that you know we live in a world where we're surrounded by voices you know some of them are crying out for justice without judgment others are crying out for judgment without justice people wanting to place things in the way they see fit or give things labels that they think they should have but you know judgment without justice is ungodly and justice without judgment is ungodly man will always get it out of balance and it says in psalm 89 14 justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and truth shall go before thy face the place where justice plus judgment is found is his throne it's in his presence his dwelling place you know it's interesting it's the earmark the evidence of his presence it's also interesting that the same verse says mercy and truth you know true justice requires mercy and real judgment requires truth you know he alone can execute true justice putting all things in its proper place and he alone can execute true judgment by giving all things its proper name and all things match their identity there's no favoritism there's no gerrymandering there's no trying to make things the way we want them to be everything in its right place you know we know the story of genesis 18 where there were three visitors that came to go spend some time with abraham we're all familiar with the story you know it's where he sits with his back toward the tent discerns sarah's heart he's the one that says that you know shall i hide from abraham the thing that i do as he begins to turn his heart toward sodom and as he begins to share with abraham kind of the mystery of his plan he says an interesting statement in genesis 18 19 he says for i know him abraham that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment you know a couple things stuck out to me there first of all to do not have to do justice and judgment is the way of the lord it's in his throne it's an earmark of his presence to do his way you know it's uh interesting that as the prophets began to speak of this in jeremiah 23 5 it says behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth speaking of a coming messiah isaiah 9 7 of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with justice and judgment or rather with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the way of the lord the way that john prepared the word a son an image god in flesh form the way of the lord on earth to do justice and judgment together you know the scripture identifying that one who came with the same characteristic of what sat on the throne but you know the second thing that the lord told abraham was he said they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment speaking of a people who would do the characteristic of what was in the throne not have judgment not have justice do them both at the same time you know david had this characteristic says in second samuel 8 15 and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment and justice unto all the people you know solomon has this nature as well because the queen of sheba traveled all that way to see if everything she had heard was true and her testimony in first kings 10 9 and ii chronicles 9 8 was blessed be the lord thy god which delighteth in thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel forever therefore made he the king to do justice and judgment the one who had asked for wisdom which says in proverbs 1 3 is justice and judgment you know many made to demonstrate made to do the characteristic of god justice and judgment you know brother david's been talking about the nature of his presence to put all things in their rightful position to give all things their proper identity by the word proverbs 21 3 says to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice so as i was reading those five little words at the beginning of this psalm i have done justice and judgment my question to myself was have i do i do my judgmental do i have you know the desire to see justice or do i do judgment and justice which is the characteristic of the lord by his nature by his word so you can see i never got past the first five verses but the very characteristic of his name somebody's testimony i wonder i have done judgment and justice which is the way of the lord so as we read that together you know my prayer for myself at least is that it can be said of me that i have this characteristic i hope that's the prayer that each of you have let's just read that section uh starting in verse 121 through 128 we'll read that together i have done judgment and justice leave me not to mine oppressors be surety for thy servant for good let not the proud oppress me mine eyes fail for thy salvation and for the word of thy righteousness deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy and teach me thy statutes i am thy servant give me understanding that i may know thy testimonies it is time for thee lord to work for they have made void thy law therefore i love thy commandments above gold yea above fine gold therefore i esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right and i hate every false way amen i bless you may have your seats it's the old time the holy spirit and the devil won't go near him that's the reason people [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

this time of fellowship we have may bring us closer to you it may encourage us and strengthen us the simplicity of the your word father be revealed to our heart and we just trust that the people this morning father will leave this place with hope and and strength to fight the great fight we ask you now to come in our midst you know what we have need up this morning before that we ask we present the needs that we know before you our sicknesses our health needs our financial needs [Music] this problems that we suffer lord you know things that we need that we don't know and we ask that you grant those things to us also this morning we ask your blessings now in your word in jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning let's open our bibles this morning and just a little time of fellowship around the word trusting that there will be something said this morning that you can take and put in the building of your life and and the statue of the perfect man that you're trying to build i believe that's what we're trying to do right each of us build ourselves into a christ-like image and i'm glad he's not done working but he's still working amen i think there's a song right even when i don't feel it he's still working and i'm i'm glad that we don't go by feelings i i we go by promise don't we so whatever he promised is what's going to be done it doesn't matter if he said it it's going to happen i'm glad i can trust in that let's turn to romans the 12th chapter of the book of romans and we'd like to read the first two verses of the 12th chapter and just have a time of fellowship this morning and i know the church is at many different levels as growth it's like any flock you have lambs and you have different age groups and different experiences and and so we just hope the word of god can reach to the place that you are this morning we trust the holy spirit will do that i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world and if i would add a word there which i don't not saying by adding to or taking away but to make it closer to us and be and be not conformed to this present world this cosmos this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god and then let's also turn over to ephesians the fifth chapter of the book of ephesians and the 25th sixth and twenty seventh the verse and this let's read these scriptures this morning it says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it you know i just you could just preach right from there but you got to remember he gave himself for you so um when you look at it that way we know that it's all about him but to him it's all about you you that's what that's what the word of god is about in the end of it all it's about you we worship him but what he did he did for you he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy without blemish heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated this morning this this verse is a great verse and it says that he might present it to himself a glorious church and so that's the first thing we realized that not only do we want to be but that he promised that we would become is a glorious church amen not according to the idea of man which is great steeples and great temples and great buildings and but we don't look upon those things the glory of the church is the character of its people amen and then he says here that that the church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing and so there's if that uh if i could say this just trying to show you a little like where we're going there's got to be a way to get rid of the spots the wrinkles and the blemishes and in just this little simple thought this morning i just want to encourage us that we have great hope in god's word for any of the problems that we carry the things that we face uh the trials that we go through he gave himself for it that any spots or wrinkles or blemishes that he could remove them from the church and he's purposed in his heart to have a glorious church and i know that the scripture says the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary one to another and we all carry the burden of our flesh for some reason it's a very difficult thing to reign in it it it i mean my flesh gets me in trouble all the time paul spoke of it this way he said oh wretched man that i am you know when i would try to do good evils always present with me the great desire to be rid of this flesh and the things that it causes us to suffer and and to endure and we think we have it under control and the enemy just goes about setting snares and traps that we just fall into and we think we're strong and we go through seasons that we just feel like mighty christians you know what i mean like we're looking for the devil you know where you at i feel great today and then there's times where we just stumble and and and we fall and our continents falls and our and we become discouraged but god's got a great way of bringing us through these things and so those are the we just want to talk along that line this morning and and go through a little bit of the scripture and talking from this message called god's power to transform so god's got the power to transform now there's a part that we play and and it's a it it's a part that's easy for us to do if we could grab a hold of it and that's the hardest part about the word of god is that god hides himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in the same and i think we just heard here the other day about when the prophet told the king to go dip in the river remember that he said here goes the king holding his nose and he goes in there and he goes you know i don't want to dip in here there's cleaner water here he said but the word said dip here and and really it wasn't that hard of a thing to do it was a simple thing but we don't feel sometimes that we can get such great results from doing something so simple and just like me this morning you know i come out and i think lord i want to preach a sermon agree about great mysteries and about great revelations in those things but you know sometimes it's the the little things that we pass over that can do so much for us and and and so in looking at this we want to look at it from a very simple uh point of view that all of us might take hold because when i look at my problems they're my problems and i'm the one that caused the problems so i i i want to in myself i want to fix my problems i want to overcome by my own power you know what i mean but the same thing in me that wants to overcome is the same thing that's in me that's causing it yeah you know what i mean so tell me that ain't in this circle you know you punch yourself and then yourself comes back and punches you and you're in this eternal warfare and we find ourselves in this warfare how many knows where that warfare is at it's in your mind and and he's always accusing you and you're always struggling to to overcome you're always struggling to go better well we've been talking about having the nature of the lord and so in doing that we find this great uh this this great struggle and this conflict going on uh within us and and if there's a simple answer to it but so let's go back and as we we talked about this and and we read this scripture and so let's just walk through this for a little bit this morning and and maybe you can glean something this morning that'll sit with you that you could say okay if i do this it will produce the results it says i i like to you know when talking about you know there's always something out there that's going to provide you a vitamin or a pill that you can take and and uh you know you take this pill and it's going to relieve you of pain you know and then you go down and it says if you don't lift anything over 50 pounds if you don't work over an hour a day you know there's all these conditions that that go with it you you know what i mean i remember i looked at diets one time and every diet was good eat this eat that and then they always had that part along with exercise well that ruined it right there you know i mean i didn't want the exercise part and sometimes we let the most important part go and uh so let's just i just want to read this and and and this statement so i i i don't know if caleb's in the back but i'm going to read a little bit out of the power of god's power to transform this morning and and i forgot to get this to the brothers ahead of time but it's it's september 11 1965 at the full gospel businessman meeting i i really encourage you to take the time to listen to this message because it's it's a very stirring message from the standpoint is that every time i hear it it really brings me under deep conviction and it just makes me so aware of how much of the world it seems sometimes that we still have in us and we all want to overcome the world don't we i mean that's our that's what we're our desire is this morning and i don't want to forget happy birthday i think right god bless you this morning and uh the and so we have this desire in us to overcome but we don't have the power in us to overcome and that we got a hope that god's got transforming power so i'd like to read this with you if maybe the brothers could put it up on the board it's right after brother brahm reads his scriptures in paragraph 32 in it and in this he says now if the lord willing i want to take my subject for this morning on god's power to transform that you might not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and now and prove that which is good perfect and acceptable will of god to prove what is the will of god i think that's the question that comes up in my mind more than anything it's what's the will of god am i in the will of god what's the will of god what's god want me to do and and when you come back in and you'll find out it's something because god's got the power to transform so if we if we could find this vein if we could find this thing that we're supposed to do and we do that thing that god's asking us to do we will find out that the results will come and the questions will come and the answers will come by the doing of the word of god it's not something that you're going to intellectually conceive and think that it's something that you that god's going to lay out a plan before you the will of god is something that is transforming you god's will is to transform you into a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish so that's what he's desiring to do that's what his will is his will is to present to himself a wife amen a church a glorious and perfect church what we say we call the church what the bride so his will is to present to gather to cleanse to purify to empower a a body of believers called his bride that he might present her to himself a glorious trophy of his love amen so that's that's what he's doing you know that's his will for you just think he wants to take you and transform you into his wife right now we look at ourselves and we all know where we come from and thank the lord we can say this morning that maybe we're not what we want to be and maybe we're not not what we should be but i feel that if you're even in this building this morning you're not what you used to be so we know he's working we know that he's that that we know that he has a goal he has a purpose he has a will something that he's trying to do so we we can't just get on this side of it that it's just us trying to do it we've got to do this we got to do this no he's got something he's doing he's got a will that he's doing he's got a purpose that he put we're his workmanship for his good pleasure we just ought to be thankful that he's chosen to make us part of it that's right so you're not alone you're not alone he's gonna he's going to mold you and make you he had something for paul to do paul's just going about his business think he's doing god a service man he's arresting the church and he's bringing him in and all of a sudden wham you know he's laying on the ground he says paul i've got to work for you to do i'm going to show you and and i'm glad that that i'm in his molding hands maybe he has to pound me a little more maybe he has to break me down a little more maybe it's a little harder for him but i'm glad that he's chosen us to mold and so let's don't forget this morning that he's doing something there's something he's got to accomplish there's something that he spoke that must come to pass and he's got all the ability and the power in the world and and out of this world to make it happen but remember what he said to paul he says paul it's hard to kick against it and maybe sometimes we kick against the the prick a little bit and we we try to fit our lives in to certain places but i think if anything this morning i think we should have confidence that god's got something he wants to do with me and and that gives me peace but let's just look at this as we go through and to build our confidence this morning he says now it's that have you found it brothers in god's power to transform phoenix arizona september 11 1965 paragraph 32. he says it's an old-fashioned text that many of your pastors have used down through your time it's been used since it was written and this this is a beautiful little section here but yet one thing about the word of god it never grows old because it's god it never grows old through every generation now for pretty near about 2 800 years or better this word of god has been read by man priest and so forth and never does it grow old i've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time i read it i find something new that i looked over the first time because it's inspired it's it's god in letter form see it's the attributes of god speaking forth and is placed on paper so if it's something about him the word of god is him amen it's his attributes is what he is it's placed on paper so those attributes are in there and he makes those attributes made known to him so you can't take the word of god and study it you can you can take it and study it like a theology and study it like a history but when when it becomes a person to you you understand that that it's someone that's talking to you now we're talking about his power to transform so you've got to see that he's got a power mixed in with this via he's got the ability to touch you he's got the ability to reach into your lives he's got the ability to to to change things he's got the ability to transform things so it's not it's not just something that's laying there in letter form it is laying there in letter form but he has the ability to take the letters and make it alive and to step into those words and make himself known to you so when you can enter into reading your scriptures if you you when and you come to that time that you're going to sit down and open the book and sit there and read and i know we do our daily bible readings and our daily devotions but in that look for his person look for his presence the presence of the lord is a wonderful thing it's the only thing that that that can lift you up and give you hope i mean our let's face it these are perilous times there there's this the world's falling apart people are are just they're they're they're not god's not in the picture and and you know we could talk about the fear and we could talk about the conditions and we can talk about the evil we may get into a little of that but let's remember one thing that we have a god that's got the power we've he's got the power and so as we greet this about the word he said he says many times man said well now man wrote this bible no the bible says itself that god wrote the bible it's the word of god it can never fail jesus said heaven and earth will fail pass away but my word shall never fail it cannot fail and being god because it's part of him and then you being a son and daughter you are part of it and that makes you a part of him so that's why we come to fellowship together around the word of god because you're part of it you understand how you're part of the word the whole word talks about that that he wants to present a church the word talks about a people that he died for the word talks about why that he came to redeem his own do you understand without you that there's nothing to the whole story it becomes fiction without you we say god's a healer with without you god's not a healer without you he's not a deliverer without you he's not a savior you're part of the word now you may look at yourself and with all your problems and all your mental things and all your weaknesses and all the way satan drags you around it seems but remember you're still part of him you've got that part your part just being a sinner was part of it just i mean that's beautiful to me because i was a sinner i was in a very very dark place i i i would really think if you could totally understand what a dark place i was in that you would really have to have a deep revelation of the power of the blood that's right of really what god is able to do for you and and from our side it is all about him because we can help ourselves we can't get out of ourselves it's very difficult to get out of yourself because everything you hear everything you you look at everything is is all comes through your senses and all comes through your feelings and all is filtered through your emotions there's so many things that you filter through that goes through all your feelings all your past experiences all your memories and everything and finally through all those things you draw a conclusion in your mind and that's where your battle is but this morning let's settle on one thing that god has the power to transform and that's what's beautiful and and so we see this great word here and and and the word never grows old so the revealed word is scripture made flesh and manifest and revealed or made known to us that's what the revealed word is is when what god wrote here is manifested it's scripture but it's scripture that's made manifest and made real and made flesh and made known to you look that's what the spirit of god does that's what god moves if i could say this all the prophecies that were written in the old testament the thing says the sun died times the diverse manners the spirit of god moved upon man well all those scriptures were laying there concerning me he said search the scriptures there were which testify of me but they were laying there in scripture form and they were reading them and they were chanting them in the temple and they were studying them they said that those scholars they could roll up those scrolls and stick a needle through them and they knew so much that word that they could tell you every word that the needle pierced that's knowing the letter well we have the privilege to know the author in other words the author has chosen a people amen that he's going to make himself known to another they can study or a person can study and say i believe this is what he wrote but when the author comes by and he tells you this is what i was talking about not only that he says i didn't write it to all those that are studying it i wrote it to you this is my love letter to you i'm going to show you what i meant i'm going to show you what i had in my mind i'm going to show you it's it's about you i did this for you i wrote about you i died for you i resurrected for you i go to prepare a place for you that you may be where i am also well there's you've got the the creator of heaven and earth living for you that's good if god be for you who can be against you i'd like to think that god's for me wouldn't you then against me how'd you like to walk out of here this morning god's against me why i wow if he ain't for me i'm toast i don't want to be toast i don't believe i am toast he said now and i can say this this morning and i hope that i can say this in a manner that is right he says but you know people say that oh you follow a man and can i say this you know we don't follow brother branham as a man we don't follow paul as a man but the way they follow christ the word we follow them in that way we thought fall be followers of me as i am a follower of christ of the word so the the things that are are are were spoken that the messenger came and spoke you know someone says i follow the teachings of william brown well maybe some people do follow the teachings of william branham but i've come to understand that it wasn't the teachings of william branham it was the word of god that he came to reveal to us jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and so that we find that that that the word remains true in itself as eternal word amen if if we could which we can't but if we could take brother madam totally out of the picture and just have the sermons there you know it would be just like having the epistles of paul there things that you could read things that could be said and and so another word so the the word remains true what was taught was the word of god and that remains eternally true because it was from the beginning it wasn't something new even the seals themselves he thought i thought were written outside the book he says no they were contained within the book but they were hiding what you can establish in your heart without denying the respect and the position of the prophet not that you can separate it the message from the prophet but when you can come to the realization that the message is the word it's the eternal word that was in the beginning we're not following the giver of the word we're following the word itself you read your bible right now paul's gone i didn't know paul after the flesh that's right but i know the word that paul brought and who he was talking about and who he was showing and the life that he was talking about i know that to be the word so paul wasn't saying follow me after the flesh we'd all be tent makers right we'd all be sitting in some sailboat you can't follow someone after the flesh i'm more of a fisherman then i am a hunter if i tried to follow our our messenger after the flesh and then and we all went through that for a season where we all drove a forward and we all tried to wear cowboy boots and we all went out and bought you know i did it all i've got a remington you know 721 you know just like brother branham's gun and and someone told me how brother bram climbed the fence and boy a climate bench just the way i can't climb a fence waiver around confidence i crawl underneath him now right it's not about following after the flesh it's about coming to the revelation that what he preached was the eternal word of god that's what we're following we're following christ jesus revealed in word form that through the revelation of the word form that we might come to know him personally because the word's what reveals his attributes and when we know his attributes then we then we desire to become like him and to have that nature but it's not we didn't know you know i didn't know uh brother branham's gone i didn't know brother branham after the flesh but i know the word that they preached because the word is the lord jesus christ made manifest so we we know that so we know that about the word and then when you can have confidence you know really what this is it's not a pamphlet that's right you know it it may be all that in the letter but in it is the eternal word of god that's who we're following we're following the lord jesus christ as he revealed himself in this day no i don't believe you can do away with the word amen the holy spirit didn't even come to speak of itself but it came to bring us into remembrance of all things that he said so don't ever let anybody ever make you feel like by believing this message that you're following a man or you're fallen you're not that was the lord jesus christ in our day bringing to us the true word of god and we'll just touch on it in a second here he says now let's go to this word this word transformed i looked it up in the dictionary yesterday when i lost track of time that i was to be up here and when i was looking for a text i found this word and this text rather scripture and the dictionary says that it's something that's changed amen how many somethings that have been changed are sitting in here today you think if he changed you this far that he can't change you all the way when he told us if i started working you i will finish it till the end amen he don't quit in fact we even read that didn't he say that uh uh there's someone walking outside do we know who that is down the side of the church uh the uh he says that quitters never win and winners never quit oh is he a winner right he ain't gonna quit i would have hate to seen what would have been like if paul tried to get back up on that horse he says it's words keep me in something that's changed it's to be changed transformed made different than it was it its character and everything has been changed in it it's been transformed now that's what we're talking about this morning we're talking about god's power to transform his power to change things no matter where you are in your life what you're looking at what you're facing what circumstances you find yourselves in you can't forget that god's got the power to transform that he's got the power of change the world don't have the power of change and they go people when the psychologist they want the psychiatrist they run the doctors and we all do that i'm not saying there's anything wrong with that we we go to do this we go to loan officers we go to banks we uh we go for financial help because we're we're working the best we can to change the circumstances around us you got an old clunker and it won't start and you finally come to the place this has got to change this is not reliable and so we'll go out and we'll go to a dealer and he'll sell us an overpriced vehicle and we'll make the payment well and and that's fine so we change things but we've still always got to remember that god has the power to change things anywhere anytime any place anything god's got the power to transform never give up on that never lose vision of that he can change something anytime he wants to change it he's a creator and he says that's the transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it god's transforming power and we know that's what he did he moved upon the earth didn't he the earth without form and without void and he transformed it and we know he planted seed in it that's right and he did all these great things that he did in in in in working and and and planning and and it says in the 44th paragraph he says therefore he created by his word he sent his word so all the seed that he had placed upon the earth he formed those seeds by his own word now we're leading to something right so how did how did he change the face of the earth by his spoken word amen and how did he change it by he planted seed in it by his word he put the he put the he put this seed there he seed he placed upon the earth he formed those seeds by his own word for there was no nothing else to make the seed out of he had placed them and they were beneath the water and he said let there be this and let there be that what was he doing he was transforming amen you say how is god going to transform me by his word let it be a perfect bride let it be without spot or wrinkle let it be without blemish let the peace of god surpass understanding let her have joy unspeakable and full of glory do you understand he spoke all these things of you amen all these things that have been spoken of his church she'll be an elect lady to amen the works that i do shall she do also look those things are spoken of us they're laying there in seed form and because he he he preached it and and every one of those seeds is going to come forth yes sir amen all the promises of god are laying in us in seed form amen oh and and we struggle we see a promise out there and we never look at that promise is being what we are we looking at something that we got to obtain or we got to go find or we got to get well that way we're trying to transform it but god's got the power to transform that seed into the life that it was intended for the promise of healing was given to you by god for you amen to be healed when you get sick it's all about you you are the attributes of god you are the word of god you are the seed of god now god's got the trance the power to transform that because he placed that seed in you and that seed's got everything in it that you need to be and i'll just read this and we're gonna i'm gonna skip most of this and just say what i have on my heart the first man was this is paragraph 47 we'll read this quickly the first man was in the image of god which is spirit john 4 says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth that's paragraph 47. i hope our screen and paragraphs are the same as by book but god is the spirit and the first man that he created was spirit man he was in the image and in the likeness of god so when we say that he was made in the image and likeness of god we we keep looking at the flesh but the image and likeness of god was that god was a spirit so when he made man in his image and likeness he was spirit but he didn't have flesh okay you don't take it beyond exactly what it says from the beginning god was the spirit right so when he made man he made him a spirit man that's right it's just like you you you you have this consciousness inside of you right of your life of your feelings your emotions everything you are your spirit what you enjoy you have a spirit man in your flesh and you know you have flesh when you hit your finger with a hammer now your flesh and your spirit are certainly divided at that moment because your spirit starts screaming out it's your flesh how many times have you done something he says oh that was stupid oh you stupid person talking about yourself you can cut your finger off you can lose a part of your body but if that's what you were then you wouldn't be whole anymore but you're still hole in your spirit so man was a spirit the image of god was spirit and he said like god and he and then he put this man in flesh and man fell so then god came down and became in the image of man that he might redeem that fallen man that's the real gospel story to my opinion god made his flesh we fell he became flesh that he could redeem us redeem us again it's about you now god in god in 6 000 years he planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoken his word it shall be this way it shall be that way it shall be everything was perfect it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they would that they would be they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of god had spoken in them should be if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak if it was a palm it was to bring forth a palm he commanded them all to bring forth what he put in them amen what happens this morning if we could hear the command of god to bring forth in us what he planted us to be may i just jump way ahead of myself but this message was the command of god to the bride to come forth and be what he planted her to be because the great creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed and the word form seed he made the world out of things that does not appear he made the world by his word god spoke everything into existence so if he made the world out of nothing by his word what's he going to make you out of hallelujah what's he going to make this bride out of not by our efforts not by mine not by strength but by my spirit saith the lord he's going to make this church this unspotted unwrinkled elect lady bride he's going to make her out of his word amen that's what he's going to make her out of because that's the way he always does everything so in all your weakness that you're sitting in this morning all your failures all your doubts all your mental battles everything that you're in everything you can look in the mirror everything that your body's doing against your spirit because the spirit wars against the flesh and the flesh wars against the spirit god's still gonna perform his word by his word he's going to bring you forth by his word now i'm going to finish with this because there's so much more that we want to go into but we can always go into it another time he said everything is under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed on the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from seed to a plant whatever it was his transforming power god put the seed in there with potential that it would be what he said it would be as long as it stayed in its right category it would be exactly what god said it would be it'd have to be that way because he made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like the word said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust of his own son that it would be that way then god said it's all good so i'll just rest and each of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that i desired it to be that's what it must be because i've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself its potential now to make out of itself exactly what i want it to be god has never changed there's the same thing today as he was then god is determined to do something he'll do it and nothing is going to stop him he'll do it now just think everything's laying there right and then here comes the enemy and what is the enemy he's a deformer first of all he deforms even adam and the purpose that they were he he changes the he he changes the whole face of the plan of god but yet god's still going to keep his word amen now this morning god's never changed his his purpose about about us right he's never changed that it's still the same he says now it's hard to say this this is paragraph 77 very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way i do the way that i've been for many years since the opening of the seven seals of the angels behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book it's the thing that's been hid is being revealed as god promised in revelations 10. he would do it now there was a purpose for him doing it now remember he said what was the purpose of god doing it you're the purpose that god was doing it you're the reason the seals were open amen you're the reason the word of god was made known there was a reason that the son of perdition was revealed in our day he said he would do it and we are the privileged people that god has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mystical fleshly mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of god made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by god is that right god as i have said before in a message god doesn't need anyone to interpret his word he's his own interpreter he says it'll happen it happens he confirms it then interprets it now so this book became a new book now why there had to be something great that that was going on so all of a sudden so god's mindful of us right so what happened satan started spraying the church with education he's going to deform the church he wants her for a bride satan wants to marry you he wants you to be his bride he wants you to produce his children he wants you to serve what he thinks important he wants you to be part of his economy but that's not the seed that god planted you to be that's not he's got to he he he's got to make you be the seed that you are you can't make it it's in there but it's got to be brought to life it's got to get back in the channel if it gets back in the channel it'll produce if it's out of the channel it produces something that's hybrid something that's misformed not something that looks like it it would be so close it would deceive the very elect but it wasn't the original purpose think of it god's mindful of you again he says it this way i'm so glad that god is mindful of us again that he can still move upon the face of the conditions he promised he would do it and call a little flock which would be his bride notice here now how perfect the church types of these edens god through the seed of his word and there is only one thing that can quicken the word and that's the spirit if it's the life giver to the word and when the life in the word meeks the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is so what what showed up in this day what was the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. it was the life the nature took the spirit of the word amen meant the promised word of the day who did it meet it meant you who was a reveal to it was revealed to you i don't care what kind of rest you are i was not i thought i was a christian but i was a member of the first church of david mcgeary i read a little interesting story it kind of struck me along these lines not to make a joke but a mother came in and found her children my grandchildren and my kids would play church i remember aaron would get my suit coat on and set up a box and he'd preach and the other brothers and sisters would all shout amen and just carrying on that's what they did they played church and so the little the little uh boy was uh reading his bible to the cat and and so the mother saw me he'd do that couple days and then one day he'd come out and he found the boy with a the cat and he was dunking them in in the in water and that the mother said well cats don't like water and the little boy said well then he shouldn't have joined my church right well if we don't like the word of god we might as well not come part of this message is is the way that god's going to transform his church into the bride because the spirit of it right the spirit of the word which was in the beginning descended put his foot on the land and the sea veiled himself can the prophet ministry that that ministry could meet the seed and when it meant the seed now god has the power to transform that seed into what that he intended it to be from the beginning and and it it's it it's just exactly you know we're we're still sons and daughters of god i don't know i had that mark but he said well but we have never lost that we're still sons and daughters of god we're still exactly what god intended us to be in the beginning but satan has sprayed us with science with education with uh with uh religion all these things he he sprayed us with and he's he he's placed on us and after he's he's frayed us with all these things uh uh uh and all these things that don't have anything to do with god the enemy now how is he going to get it off of us by renewing our minds by the washing of the water of the word you've got problems you've got habits start washing in the word start reading your bible don't sit there and carry a mind battle on in your mind with all the hope that i'm going to overcome all the hope i'm not going to do this again gathering up all your mustard and all your strength and saying i i refuse i i'm not gonna i'm done with the cowboys till next season until they win their first game then super bowl and you're right back in it that that's not how it works i hope i can express this to you this morning you can't bring the seed to life in you it's got to meet the word it's got to get in the channel if it meets the word then the word is what brings it to life and starts turning it into what it's supposed to be you can have all kinds of weaknesses you can smoke you can drink i remember i believe it was brother bud thought with giving the testimony help he he got up and said i got to go check on the horses and and uh he he went out but he still smoked whenever he were probably still smoked he's rubber bands guide he was out there smoking you know because he smoked and he come back by the tent and and creeping in everybody's crying all of a sudden i heard this voice out of the tent brother bud when did you quit smoking just now what happened he meant the spirit amen of the word he meant the nature of the word he meant the person of the word where was that nature and that person where is he he's in the word he's not in your imagination he's not in your program he's not in your plan if you've got if you're shackled by lust if you're shackled by envy if you're shackled by any of the things that was never your original channel that was never your original condition satan sprayed that on you who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect satan sprayed that on us all all of us all of us were sons and daughters of god to all of us were elected that that never that's never changed you know what i mean but uh he i just had that such a beautiful quote that brother branham said he he said you're still the sons and daughters of god it's just that satan has deformed you he said listen to this and this paragraph 69 and we are all still in the image of god but some are so deformed as sons of god they walk contrary to his word and to his ways that he had just provided for us to walk setting something the world twisted us out of the way pulls us close to it and away from the straight narrow strip that he planted in us in us us in to be sons and daughters of god sin has done this evil thing to the sons and daughters of god so satan sprayed those things and so again just summing up this morning to what i'm trying to say it's our desire to come into the nature of god it's our it's our desire to be christian but we've got all this spray on us we've got all this stuff that's put on us that wasn't really meant for the sons and daughters of god i can't talk god's mindful of us so if i could say this when he he brought the word back to us because the words the only thing that can renew our minds and wash us and cleanse us so what i'm trying to say this morning is if you want to overcome yes sir don't create a program for yourself god's got a program for you start washing what happens when you spill coffee on you leslie come home the other day says i'm full of coffee just fill the whole thing of coffee all over gotta go in and wash taking a shower what she said i was trying to blame it on evan but i did it no me blame it if you get if you're dirty you don't have to worry how you got dirty the answer's the same amount it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it and as simple as this is if you will start washing in the water of the word it will cleanse you you might not see immediate results but if you keep washing and keep washing keep reading keep listening keep getting in every time you're doing it that spirit's starting to make contact with the seed that's in you it's god's power to make the change but he has a way he does it he does it by his word the change comes by his word so if you make contact with the word you're making contact with chains it'll work amen it'll work that's right no matter how defeated you are put on a tape read your bible get a book kneel down and pray take the word of god start washing with the word of god and you can't wash in used water and get clean when justification came it washed off all that catholic candle stuff and all that stuff that said man had to do penance and all this work all that stuff was in that water that justification washed off you can't get clean with that water it won't cleanse you of the dirt of today it won't cleanse you with what satan's trying to spray on us today in our news in our schools what things they're teaching you can't you can't wash yourself with water that's been used when sanctification came it washed all those things of all that dirt that was there from justification it's been cleansing the church the word of god's been moving up through the ages you can't wash in that water and get clean you can't walk in pentecost in the restoration of the gifts established in those things that won't clean you anymore that water did its washing but he's given us water to wash in amen that's what he provided because he's mindful of you he wants to cleanse you by the washing of the word of god so he provided the water he provided the wash for you you've got boy trouble give him the word of god prophet of god put it this way take the word put on the thinking man's filter it'll wash that stuff out of you you think some worldly guy he's he he's just so handsome and he acts like he likes you and you start fluttering all off be careful same thing with you boys just don't look upon the pearls on the outside because if god tarries yeah someone said well what are you worried about if god carries this message will just be something in history it'll never be history it'll never grow old it's the word it's still true it'll always be true just like everything paul said is true everything that shows the word of god it's there to wash it's what's going to bring you into the nature of god it's what's going to bring you into the don't turn it into religion use it for what it's intended to do to cleanse you and make you free of blemishes and to present you a glorious church remember all this is here for you for you to become the bride for you to overcome for you to be victorious your his workmanship foreordained in christ jesus works that you should walk into um and when you think of it this morning he he got the power to transform but he's got a way he does it and it's by his word so if that seed will come forth if it gets into the right channel so if you get yourself into the channel of the word that word will start washing all the devil spray off of you think that's a problem some of us just need to take a shower in god's word it'll wash all the devil spray off of you it'll start making contact with that predestinated life of that seed and that seed will start becoming what that it's predestinated to become but you can't take the word out of the picture you can't take the word that sent to do it out of the picture that's what he gave this to you for to transform you it ain't just believing it it ain't recognizes the truth i could give you a bar of dove soap and you could set it in your bathroom in the box and say that's soap that's dove soap that's spiritual self the dove represents the spirit and you'll still stink you've got to take it out and you've got to get in the water how many have ever just taken a bar of soap and just rubbed it on you and thought you was clean i bet you everybody in here cleans with water that's what water does it cleans you the washing of the water of the word cleanses you makes you clean brings you back to what that you are and he's got the power to do it you take that word god's got the power to change you it's in the word the power to change you the power to transform the power to take the new heavens and the and all the earth and turn it into what it is he's got the power to do that and that's why he's come he's come with the power to bring this bride back to what she's intended to be by the washing of the word he's mindful of us again and i i love this and i'm going to close with this little statement that you could stand as as we closed this morning and so we can be dismissed i went longer in what i i wanted to he said notice in noah's time seeing the word being erected to float you like that noah had the word right and he erected that word and made a boat to float to float now let me make a little remark here the word being put together for to be transformed from the ground to the skies amen that's what he's doing to transform you from the ground to the sky you want to overcome you got habits you got problems you've got natures you've got spirits you've got worries you've got all those things go get in the word read your bible listen to the word of god let it wash you let it transform you there's power in the word to change the whole face of the earth you don't think there's power in the word to transform you there's a lot of things about me i don't like but i've got a place that i can run that'll change them let us bow our heads this morning and ask yourself in your heart are there things about yourself that you would like changed maybe frustration maybe just something that you just can't shake maybe something you love maybe a program maybe a song maybe a sport no matter what it is and it wasn't whether i think it's okay or somebody else thinks it's okay it's what do you feel in your heart [Music] all things are lawful for me but all things aren't expedient there's something in your life this morning and you say lord i'd like this to be changed [Music] he's speaking back to you and say my son my daughter if you'll come to my word i will give you revelation and transformation for your deliverance i'll give you faith to overcome [Music] but faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god i've sent and vindicated my word to you that you could take it and you could wash the spray of the devil off of you that you could drink it and it would be transforming power to transform you into the son and daughter of god that i predestinated you to be lord i know it's hid in simplicity this morning i know i don't have the vocabulary or the gift to expound on it and make it so clear but you've come in this day and brought the word the transforming spoken word and we're privileged that you've done it and we realized that you've done it so that i could become the bride that i'm predestinated to be father may i take your provided way the washing of the word may i not
