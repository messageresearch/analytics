[14:49] in the judgment, nor sinners in the

[48:14] Our
[48:18] heavenly father,
[48:21] Lord, once again we ask you to look
[48:24] beyond our faults.
[48:28] And this morning,
[48:31] Lord Jesus, see our needs
[48:35] for Father, we are promised that you
[48:38] know what we have need of even before
[48:42] that we ask it.
[48:46] You're the great Jehovah Gyra, the
[48:49] supplier of all that we have need of.
[48:55] And Father,
[48:57] though we're encompassed about with such
[49:00] a great enemy,
[49:03] you are a present help in the time of
[49:05] trouble.
[49:07] Father, may each person in here this
[49:10] morning feel your divine love.
[49:14] Father, may they feel your presence. And
[49:19] may they know that it's your hand
[49:21] reaching out
[49:24] to their hearts and their lives.
[49:27] That you're the great shepherd and that
[49:30] you want to guide them from every place
[49:33] of distress and peril.
[49:36] into your sheepfold.
[49:40] Father, may we value that above all
[49:44] things. We ask you to bless those that
[49:47] are come out this morning, our visitors,
[49:51] Father, that you've brought amongst us,
[49:54] Father. May they feel at home. May the
[49:57] we all know that we're part of one great
[49:59] family, one great body, and you're our
[50:03] King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Bless
[50:06] us this morning in Jesus precious name
[50:09] we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless. You
[50:13] may be seated this morning.
[50:19] And I I I know that uh someone's going
[50:23] to ask me if I shaved
[50:26] and I didn't shave. My whiskers grew
[50:30] backwards
[50:31] and um I I just woke up and there was no
[50:37] whiskers. We have a baby dedication. So
[50:40] anyway, but anyway, so we've got that
[50:43] out of the way. Also, I feel that maybe
[50:46] it's better on my trip to Africa. Um, I
[50:50] just didn't want to have any obstacles,
[50:51] but you've been so gracious to me. I as
[50:55] soon as I get back, I'll probably grow
[50:56] it back. So, thank you.
[50:59] We have a baby dedication today. And uh,
[51:02] Brother Samuel and Sister Naomi and
[51:06] Matthew and Marco want to dedicate their
[51:09] baby brother Micah.
[51:12] The so Micah Bakoli is going to be
[51:15] dedicated and we'd like them to come and
[51:17] I think the grandparents are here. We'd
[51:20] like to invite the grandparents also to
[51:22] come and dedicate their grandson with
[51:25] us. So, uh you're all welcome just to
[51:28] come and be with us. Amen. Let's sing it
[51:31] as we pray. Bring them in. Hallelujah.
[51:37] Oh, bring them in.
[51:42] Bring them in.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Bring the littlemen.
[51:54] [Music]
[52:09] God bless you.
[52:11] God bless you. Thank you so much. Lord
[52:15] bless you today. This is Micah Naomi
[52:19] boys. Now you got somebody that's more
[52:22] special than you.
[52:25] That's just how it goes. You know what I
[52:27] mean? But we're we're blessed that the
[52:30] Lord blessed them. And I I think he's at
[52:34] peace right now. So I won't disturb him.
[52:37] Uh this is the grace of God to us. You
[52:42] know, every little child
[52:44] is a lets us know that there's life
[52:49] and it's actually a sign of eternal life
[52:52] to us. That there's got to be a life
[52:55] that keeps perpetuating
[52:58] that keeps us going. We know one day
[53:00] that's going to come to an end, but life
[53:02] won't come to an end because the gift of
[53:05] God is eternal life through Christ
[53:08] Jesus. And just think if you have
[53:10] eternal life this morning, think how
[53:12] blessed you are. And if you if you don't
[53:15] know that you have eternal life this
[53:17] morning, maybe God will open your eyes
[53:19] and your heart today. So, we're gonna
[53:23] ask you to dedicate your son, the
[53:26] grandparents. Nice to have each of them
[53:28] with us once again and uh then we'll all
[53:32] pray together. So Lord bless you.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[54:06] The benediction
[54:09] material.
[54:13] Benediction.
[54:52] Amen.
[54:54] Amen. Let us all pray. Our gracious
[54:56] Father, this young child that you have
[55:00] so brought into your world, Father, we
[55:02] know that before the foundation of the
[55:05] world, before there was ever a star hung
[55:07] in the sky,
[55:09] that you knew he'd be here this morning,
[55:12] and that we as a people would lift him
[55:15] back to you and dedicate him into your
[55:18] hands. That you would encamp your angels
[55:21] about them and keep them. Father, may he
[55:24] bring this family together in such a
[55:26] unity and love and and joy in their
[55:30] hearts that they are all part of
[55:32] something together, Father, that's been
[55:35] passed from generation to generation.
[55:38] Lord, we just simply ask your blessings
[55:40] upon his life, Father. May he grow and
[55:43] prosper. May he come to know you and
[55:46] know your his calling and will in his
[55:50] life. We ask that you bless this family.
[55:52] Father, may they continue to let the
[55:54] light of the gospel shine. Father, may
[55:57] the the boys raise their little brother
[56:00] and keep a eye on them and watch over
[56:03] them. We ask that you would do all these
[56:05] great things in the precious name of the
[56:08] Lord Jesus Christ. We dedicate Micah
[56:10] back to you, Lord. May you receive them
[56:13] now in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[56:16] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you so much.
[56:19] Hallelujah. God bless you. God bless you
[56:22] all.
[56:28] Hallelujah.
[56:29] Amen. The Lord's good, isn't he?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're going to turn this
[56:35] morning in our Bibles. Uh let us stand
[56:38] and we'll just read a scripture this
[56:40] morning. and um
[56:52] and found in Proverbs the third uh I
[56:56] guess chapter of Proverbs and of course
[56:59] Samuel uh uh uh this great writing of of
[57:03] Solomon uh he he's considered one of the
[57:07] wisest men that ever walked on the earth
[57:11] and his instructions has always been put
[57:15] God first. Put God first. And so let us
[57:19] read this uh uh this morning. It says,
[57:26] "My son, forget not my law, but let
[57:30] thine heart keep my commandments.
[57:34] for length of days and long life and
[57:37] peace
[57:39] shall be
[57:41] they added to thee.
[57:44] Let not mercy and truth forsake thee.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Bind them about thy neck.
[57:52] Write them upon the tablets of thine
[57:57] heart.
[57:59] So shalt thou find favor and good
[58:03] understanding
[58:04] in the sight of God and man. Trust in
[58:09] the Lord with all thine heart and lean
[58:14] not unto thy own understanding.
[58:19] And in all thy ways acknowledge him and
[58:23] he shall direct thy path. Father, we ask
[58:28] you to bless your word to us in Jesus
[58:31] precious name we pray. Amen. You may be
[58:33] seated.
[58:40] This morning, we're going to just play a
[58:42] few moments of this message that our
[58:45] messenger preached. Lean not to your own
[58:48] understanding.
[58:50] And you know, that's a
[58:53] uh that's a great word of advice. He
[58:56] said, "Bind the truth and and and
[58:59] righteousness around your neck." In
[59:01] other words, keep it before you all the
[59:04] time. So, it's so important that we
[59:07] understand that we lean not to our own
[59:11] understanding or the way that we
[59:14] perceive things because I think we
[59:16] always got to remember this simple fact
[59:19] is that God knows what we don't know.
[59:23] He knows what we don't know. He knows
[59:27] the beginning from the end. He knows
[59:29] where things started and where things
[59:32] are going. and we don't you know and uh
[59:37] so it's important for us to
[59:42] uh realize that we we seem to have a
[59:47] security
[59:49] in our own understanding
[59:51] that we we feel that when we got a
[59:56] handle on something then things are
[59:59] okay. But you know that's not always the
[1:00:03] case because uh a lot of people uh are
[1:00:06] are deceived and and that's what
[1:00:09] deception is is when someone lies to
[1:00:12] you. But it's in our nature it says we
[1:00:16] feel better when we put things in a
[1:00:19] perspective that we can comprehend.
[1:00:23] So when we that's our tendency is is we
[1:00:27] feel comfortable with what we
[1:00:30] understand. We feel comfortable with
[1:00:33] what we comprehend. And when we don't
[1:00:36] understand it and we don't see it and we
[1:00:40] don't uh feel it in our uh in our our
[1:00:47] mind then we seem to have a tendency to
[1:00:52] uh draw back from it. And Solomon's
[1:00:56] trying to encourage us some. Don't lean
[1:00:58] to your understanding. Don't lean to
[1:01:01] those things. You know, write the word
[1:01:04] of God in your tablets on your heart.
[1:01:06] You know, follow after him. Put him
[1:01:09] first and he will direct your path. He
[1:01:12] will he will tell you which way to go,
[1:01:16] which way to travel. And we and so many
[1:01:19] times we don't want to take a step
[1:01:21] forward uh unless we understand what the
[1:01:25] result is, what we understand what the
[1:01:27] outcome is or or until we have some
[1:01:31] perception of what it is. We don't want
[1:01:33] to step out what we might perceive in
[1:01:36] ourself into darkness. You know what I
[1:01:39] mean? What am I going where what's going
[1:01:41] to happen? But we've got to remember one
[1:01:43] thing that everything with God's based
[1:01:46] on faith. And he tells them, he says,
[1:01:48] "Trust in the Lord. Trust in the Lord."
[1:01:52] He'll direct your path. You got to don't
[1:01:55] lean to your own understanding. Don't
[1:01:57] lean to how you think things should be
[1:02:00] or what it looks like because we have a
[1:02:03] great creator that can change things.
[1:02:06] And and you know, a lot of times we we'd
[1:02:08] say it like this. You know, I can see
[1:02:10] how this could happen.
[1:02:13] You know what I mean? Oh, I can see it
[1:02:15] now. I can see how that can happen. Or,
[1:02:18] you know, that makes sense.
[1:02:20] You know, or I get it. You know, we've
[1:02:23] got that that just that desire to be
[1:02:27] able to hold on to something and because
[1:02:32] we comprehend it in our mind. And uh and
[1:02:37] so that it's it's so important to know
[1:02:40] that that God
[1:02:43] knows what we don't,
[1:02:46] you know, just always think of that. And
[1:02:49] he knows where it come from and where
[1:02:52] it's going.
[1:02:55] And so if we could begin to do to do
[1:02:58] that and and and so we're going to play
[1:03:01] a little bit, but I'd like to read you
[1:03:03] just a a a few little statements this
[1:03:07] morning because, you know, our our
[1:03:10] understanding
[1:03:12] really can only go as far as our natural
[1:03:15] being and our natural senses. So we
[1:03:19] understand by what we see, what we hear,
[1:03:23] what we taste. You you know what I mean?
[1:03:26] And then we go by our feelings, our
[1:03:29] consciousness. You know, uh you hear
[1:03:31] that uh saying many time, I have a gut
[1:03:35] feeling. You know what I mean? Or I I
[1:03:38] just I just sense, you know, it it's
[1:03:42] amazing how you can get in a place and
[1:03:45] and you have a sense of fear. maybe you
[1:03:48] don't even know why or you become uneasy
[1:03:51] and and those are all things that are
[1:03:54] all uh in the natural realm. And I like
[1:03:58] this statement because it it brought to
[1:04:00] light something in in my own thinking.
[1:04:04] It says, I'm just getting to this. The
[1:04:07] thing is occurring
[1:04:10] again till man and women and people will
[1:04:15] learn lean to a certain church that they
[1:04:20] have joined and belong to. No matter
[1:04:24] what the word of God says about it, they
[1:04:27] go right on with that, leaning to their
[1:04:31] own understanding and ignoring the word
[1:04:35] of God.
[1:04:37] Now listen how they ignore the word of
[1:04:39] God. It It's kind of amazing. It says,
[1:04:43] "And ignoring the word of God as if it
[1:04:47] hasn't never even been written."
[1:04:54] In other words, they ignore it like it's
[1:04:57] not there to consult.
[1:05:01] It's not there to read. it's not there
[1:05:04] to uh look into. In other words, it it's
[1:05:08] not a source to their understanding.
[1:05:12] They lean to their own understanding.
[1:05:15] They lean to their own perceptions. They
[1:05:18] lean to their their their own uh
[1:05:22] acknowledgment or they lean to what that
[1:05:25] they have heard and what that they've
[1:05:28] been told and what that they've been
[1:05:31] taught and they just join something and
[1:05:34] they they they they
[1:05:37] grab a hold of the understanding and
[1:05:40] they join the crowd and the crowd just
[1:05:43] carries them along and they never have
[1:05:46] sat back man ever looked at what the
[1:05:49] word of God might have said about it. In
[1:05:53] fact, it's like the word of God wasn't
[1:05:56] even written. In other words, there's
[1:05:58] nothing written on this subject. There's
[1:06:00] nothing written. Any man that really
[1:06:03] would sit down and look into the word of
[1:06:07] God, they would find out there's no
[1:06:09] there's no there's just not three gods.
[1:06:13] They they they would look like they
[1:06:15] would find out that nobody in the
[1:06:17] scripture had ever been baptized any
[1:06:20] other way than in the name of the Lord
[1:06:22] Jesus.
[1:06:24] So they they but they don't they don't
[1:06:27] regard it as if it is written. In other
[1:06:31] words, it doesn't it's it that that's
[1:06:34] just their approach to it that they're
[1:06:37] just going to take everything
[1:06:39] secondhand. And and that's the hardest
[1:06:42] thing for a church and in our lives that
[1:06:45] we go through this great battle of of
[1:06:48] our own understanding. How I understand
[1:06:51] it, how I see it, how I perceive it. And
[1:06:55] and Solomon's telling us here, don't do
[1:06:58] that, son. But look to the word of God.
[1:07:01] Look to the commandments of God. Look to
[1:07:04] what God says about it. Put God's
[1:07:06] thinking. Let this mind be in you that
[1:07:09] was in Christ Jesus. And because
[1:07:13] I know you it's like your only your
[1:07:16] substance. You like to feel secure in
[1:07:20] yourself
[1:07:23] and we don't want to lose that security.
[1:07:25] We don't want to lose that confidence.
[1:07:28] We've got to we've almost got to gird
[1:07:30] ourselves up to go out into the world
[1:07:33] and hold our ground and hold our stand
[1:07:36] and and present our thoughts and ideas
[1:07:40] and and here's we have a great God
[1:07:42] that's on our side and he's speaking out
[1:07:46] to us. He said don't lean to your
[1:07:49] own understanding. Don't put your trust
[1:07:52] in that. You've got one greater looking
[1:07:56] after you. You have somebody that's that
[1:08:00] that is in charge of you.
[1:08:03] Somebody that
[1:08:05] has not only loved you, but has left his
[1:08:10] life for you. And as we heard Wednesday
[1:08:12] night, placed his blood out in front of
[1:08:16] you and upon you. And and and he's a
[1:08:20] good shepherd. And he said he says so he
[1:08:23] says he says they link to their own
[1:08:27] understanding ignoring the word of God
[1:08:29] as it hasn't even been written. It's
[1:08:31] ungeratized
[1:08:33] seed of human life. It's got the
[1:08:37] physical life
[1:08:39] but no spiritual life in it to be
[1:08:42] quickened. The veil is over their face.
[1:08:47] And so I think this morning that's what
[1:08:50] uh we want to make sure is that the veil
[1:08:54] is rent.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You understand? We're wanting to go
[1:08:57] forward. That's what our whole our whole
[1:09:00] theme of our heart is is how do we move
[1:09:03] forward? How do we move from where that
[1:09:06] we are going forward? And so I'd like to
[1:09:09] read another statement and I thought
[1:09:11] this is thing that people
[1:09:14] that and I'll get to this here a little
[1:09:17] bit. I'd like to read this. It says now
[1:09:20] if we're on a gold standard
[1:09:23] and we are broke
[1:09:26] now what's going to happen?
[1:09:29] What is going to happen?
[1:09:32] Now how many knows that we're broke?
[1:09:37] So what's going to happen? And listen, I
[1:09:40] thought this was just so tremendous. He
[1:09:42] says, he says, "What's going to happen?"
[1:09:45] You know, the rich people of this
[1:09:48] nation, these big of factories and
[1:09:52] whiskey men and tobacco men and so forth
[1:09:55] like that. It's not going to stand. It's
[1:09:58] not going to stand to change the
[1:10:01] currency. It's the only thing we'll have
[1:10:05] to do is borrow it.
[1:10:07] And there's only one place you can
[1:10:09] borrow it. And when we do, we'll sell
[1:10:13] our birthrights to it. That's right.
[1:10:16] Now, what are you go what are you going
[1:10:21] to do? You you are o owned by it. That
[1:10:26] system, there's nothing else you can do.
[1:10:29] I thought, you know, they're the our
[1:10:31] currencyy's broke. So, they're they're
[1:10:33] they're trying to put in Bitcoin.
[1:10:35] They're trying to do everything.
[1:10:39] You know what I mean? They'll they'll do
[1:10:41] what they've got to do. But listen to
[1:10:43] this. He says, "Oh people,
[1:10:46] don't think I you might think I'm crazy,
[1:10:49] but when my voice is silent in death,
[1:10:53] these tapes will still be playing and
[1:10:56] you will recognize that what I've said
[1:11:00] has come to pass.
[1:11:05] Now, just think where we're where we're
[1:11:07] we're sitting this morning.
[1:11:11] Where where we're sitting this morning.
[1:11:13] You are the the people that God has
[1:11:18] chosen
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; to see what is coming to pass. There was
[1:11:24] a people that were chosen to hear it.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And they came on the
[1:11:31] scene. They were called out of
[1:11:33] denomination. They sat in the meetings.
[1:11:36] They heard him preach things. They saw
[1:11:38] the vindication, the signs and wonders.
[1:11:41] But now he said, "There's a people
[1:11:43] that's going to come that are going to
[1:11:45] hear these tapes and see what I've said
[1:11:49] coming to pass." Hallelujah.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't count yourself out of the
[1:11:55] picture. Just say, "Oh, I wasn't there."
[1:11:58] No, you were here. And you were here not
[1:12:01] to lean to your own understanding, but
[1:12:03] to watch the word of God come to pass,
[1:12:07] to to put on the Isab that you might see
[1:12:11] and to recognize the prophecies and the
[1:12:14] things that were spoken and the things
[1:12:16] that were pointed out. Even though they
[1:12:19] may have been in seed form, we're
[1:12:21] actually a generations that's sitting
[1:12:23] here and seeing things that were just
[1:12:26] talked about. That's right.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; And we could go on
[1:12:31] uh you know into as it was in the days
[1:12:34] of Sodom.
[1:12:37] So I mean just think of of the great
[1:12:41] uh place
[1:12:43] that you're sitting
[1:12:45] and and what it is
[1:12:48] that God's uh called us to be. He's
[1:12:54] called us to be the great amen to the
[1:12:57] word of God.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So be it. So it is. This be the
[1:13:04] truth.
[1:13:06] And and you're actually have ISAB
[1:13:11] that you could see.
[1:13:13] What a blessing.
[1:13:17] Every
[1:13:19] believer all down through the ages would
[1:13:21] have longed to live in the day that
[1:13:24] you're living. And the challenge of this
[1:13:27] day, not to lean to your own
[1:13:31] understanding, not to lean to
[1:13:33] perceptions
[1:13:35] and things that are being presented to
[1:13:40] you as if they are when the truth of the
[1:13:44] matter is the word of God is what's
[1:13:46] true.
[1:13:51] And let's just finish before we play 25
[1:13:54] minutes this morning. He says, "For by
[1:13:56] one spirit we are all baptized into one
[1:13:59] body."
[1:14:01] So that's the first thing we understand
[1:14:03] this morning is we're not divided.
[1:14:07] God doesn't divide men. Men divide men.
[1:14:10] And what divides them is their different
[1:14:14] understandings.
[1:14:15] One man reads the scripture and he comes
[1:14:18] up with a different understanding and
[1:14:20] now he makes a doctrine out of that or
[1:14:24] he makes a creed out of that. This is
[1:14:27] what's important. This is the thing.
[1:14:29] This is the major. This is all that we
[1:14:32] need to have and another man reads
[1:14:34] something else and then they can't do on
[1:14:37] this. You give you give men a math book
[1:14:41] and they'll all come together more
[1:14:43] united. You give them a Bible and
[1:14:46] they'll go more divided
[1:14:51] because they that man leans to their own
[1:14:53] understanding. And God's always built
[1:14:56] his church upon revelation.
[1:15:00] And God doesn't reveal he he doesn't
[1:15:04] reveal one truth to somebody else and a
[1:15:08] different truth to somebody else. He's
[1:15:12] an unchanging God. Now he'll give
[1:15:14] measures of revelation. One person may
[1:15:17] have greater revelation than another
[1:15:19] person. But that is not attributed to
[1:15:23] spirituality. It's not attributed to
[1:15:26] position is just strictly attributed to
[1:15:30] the grace of God. If I'm true to what
[1:15:34] God has showed me in little, then little
[1:15:37] will required of me. If if if God has
[1:15:40] showed me much, then much is going to be
[1:15:43] required of me.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; But God's reward is the same for all men
[1:15:49] because that reward was purchased by the
[1:15:52] blood of Jesus Christ. It was not
[1:15:54] earned.
[1:15:57] He says, "We're baptized into one body
[1:16:01] and become members of that body.
[1:16:04] I don't care what brand you've got on
[1:16:07] you, you know, Baptist Methodist, none
[1:16:10] of that matters, right?
[1:16:13] That don't have nothing to do with it.
[1:16:17] That the only way you can be not by
[1:16:23] joining, not by creed,
[1:16:26] not by ex exciting this or reciting this
[1:16:32] or any other thing, nor by education or
[1:16:36] theology.
[1:16:37] You're a Christian when you're born
[1:16:40] again.
[1:16:41] And you cannot be born again unless
[1:16:45] you've been elected to be born again.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; You know, people put tons of pressure on
[1:16:57] people. Oh, you got to be born again.
[1:16:59] You got to be If you're not elected to
[1:17:01] be born again, you can't be born again.
[1:17:03] But if you're elected to be born again,
[1:17:05] you will be born again.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So you you can
[1:17:11] rest in that. I've heard the call. God's
[1:17:14] reached his hand down to me. He's
[1:17:16] telling me it's actually the proof of
[1:17:18] your election.
[1:17:20] You can't even look back to where you
[1:17:23] come from.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And that's part of what we're going to
[1:17:26] talk about in a little moment. He said,
[1:17:30] he said, "Unless you're for no man can
[1:17:33] come to me except my father draws him."
[1:17:37] So that's what your question is today.
[1:17:38] Am I being drawn?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; If I'm being drawn, well, good. That
[1:17:46] means I'm going. I'm moving. God's
[1:17:48] pulling me. Now, some of us, he's just
[1:17:51] got to drag.
[1:17:54] You know what I mean? He's got a You
[1:17:56] ever see a kid in the store and fights
[1:17:58] his mama and he's kicking and fussing
[1:18:01] and she's got her hand and she's just
[1:18:03] dragging him and going on. You know what
[1:18:05] I want to do? I want to take my belt off
[1:18:08] and I want to go over there and I'll
[1:18:09] straighten that kid out.
[1:18:12] Oh, delete that from the internet,
[1:18:15] right? You know, cuz they don't believe,
[1:18:18] right? Spare the rod and lose the child.
[1:18:24] You don't have to beat them. You know
[1:18:26] what I mean? But they they need to know
[1:18:28] there's a higher authority than their
[1:18:30] own understanding. Well, we need to know
[1:18:33] sometime there's a higher authority than
[1:18:35] our understanding. You know that
[1:18:37] command's trusting in his his canary
[1:18:40] brain,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; right? His perception of life, his
[1:18:46] perception of creation, his perception
[1:18:48] of the world. He's doing making all his
[1:18:51] decisions based on what he sees and
[1:18:53] thinks. And there's a higher power that
[1:18:56] knows really what's going on. And now
[1:18:58] we're invited by his grace and mercy to
[1:19:03] trust in him, put our lives into his
[1:19:06] hands, and lean not to our own
[1:19:08] understanding, but let him direct our
[1:19:11] path.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; How wonderful is that?
[1:19:18] Amen. He said,
[1:19:20] he said, "For no man come me except my
[1:19:22] father draw him."
[1:19:25] and and all the Father hath given me
[1:19:28] will come.
[1:19:30] Amen. And I'll raise him up at the last
[1:19:33] days. Amen. You know, the Bible said you
[1:19:38] can believe a lie and be damned by it.
[1:19:43] See, that's exactly the truth.
[1:19:47] They form no matter what the word of God
[1:19:50] says.
[1:19:52] They lean to their own understanding.
[1:19:56] They lean on it. They believe it and
[1:20:00] they think it's the truth. And you can
[1:20:03] keep believing a lie over and over till
[1:20:08] it's the truth to you.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Now you talk about selfdeception.
[1:20:18] Eve believed Satan's lie as God's truth.
[1:20:24] It was, you know, the the seduction of
[1:20:27] Satan wasn't just a snake handing an
[1:20:30] apple, you know. I mean, I I mean,
[1:20:36] Eve was not that
[1:20:38] ignorant,
[1:20:41] you know? I mean, can you imagine people
[1:20:43] leaning to their own understanding? They
[1:20:46] think a snake come out of an apple tree
[1:20:49] and said, "Eat this apple."
[1:20:55] And they sit right back there and
[1:20:58] they've heard a lie so much they never
[1:21:01] they don't even look at it if if it was
[1:21:04] even written,
[1:21:06] you know, and and all of a sudden she
[1:21:08] realized it's naked.
[1:21:10] Well, we need to get apples and start
[1:21:13] passing them out.
[1:21:18] You know, you know, they just walk up to
[1:21:21] someone that's walking down the street.
[1:21:23] Some of these clothes they have on. I
[1:21:25] don't even know why they buy the
[1:21:26] clothes. They're all ripped and they got
[1:21:28] holes in them and everything's not
[1:21:29] covered, you know, and one shoulder's
[1:21:31] hanging out and there's no nothing on
[1:21:34] the back and all the fronts are ripped
[1:21:36] out and they're so short, you know, and
[1:21:38] you paid for that.
[1:21:42] I had painter rags that looked just like
[1:21:44] that.
[1:21:47] You go give them an apple.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But people they hear a lie so much they
[1:21:55] get they get caught in hearing the same
[1:21:57] thing over and over and over again. I
[1:22:00] remember when I came up in this message,
[1:22:02] I'd hear people say, "Brother Bram said,
[1:22:03] Brother Bram said this. Brother Bram
[1:22:05] said that." I heard it so much I thought
[1:22:07] Brother Bram said it.
[1:22:09] And then all the message became
[1:22:11] available to us and we found out there
[1:22:14] was all kinds of stuff he never said.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Now listen to what we're talking about.
[1:22:25] Lean not to your own understanding.
[1:22:31] Just don't buy something
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; because somebody tells you.
[1:22:37] just don't accept it. You understand
[1:22:41] that there's there's a place to take
[1:22:44] everything back to
[1:22:47] and it's God's word. He said
[1:22:51] to he says, "But how do we know whether
[1:22:54] it's truth or not?" God proves it truth
[1:22:59] because it's his word and he vindicates
[1:23:03] it. He does his own interpretation
[1:23:08] of it.
[1:23:11] Don't lean to your understanding.
[1:23:14] The Lord will bring it to pass. The Lord
[1:23:16] will interpret it. The Lord will
[1:23:18] vindicate it. He will show who has the
[1:23:22] truth and who doesn't.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; They that wait upon the Lord, they shall
[1:23:29] renew their strength.
[1:23:31] You never have to be forced by fear.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You never have to. You the minute you
[1:23:38] feel that someone's forcing you to make
[1:23:41] a a a decision by fear or to join
[1:23:45] something. The minute that someone ever
[1:23:47] tells you, "Oh, you don't have the
[1:23:49] revelation or you don't believe this.
[1:23:52] You don't have a revelation." That's man
[1:23:55] trying to give you their understanding
[1:23:58] as a revelation. and they if you accept
[1:24:01] that, don't lean to that.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; If you're his, he'll speak to you
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; or that little part in your heart,
[1:24:12] you'll know it's not right. But don't
[1:24:14] lean to your own thinking. Now,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; the scripture says you can't add to it
[1:24:22] or take
[1:24:24] one word from it. Leave it alone. God
[1:24:27] will vindicate it. You can trust that
[1:24:31] like he said go. If you acknowledge God
[1:24:34] in all your ways, he will direct your
[1:24:39] path. If you acknowledge him in all your
[1:24:44] ways, acknowledge his existence.
[1:24:46] Acknowledge his power. Acknowledge his
[1:24:48] ability. Acknowledge whatever he is.
[1:24:50] Acknowledge the fact that you're in his
[1:24:53] hands and you want him to guide you and
[1:24:55] take you. He'll take you out of all that
[1:24:58] stuff. There's all kinds of lies out
[1:25:00] there that have been told about this
[1:25:02] message, about the prophet, about
[1:25:04] different doctrines, people selling all
[1:25:07] kinds of things. You know, he's coming
[1:25:09] back, he's going to have this, he's
[1:25:10] going to do that, and and he's God, and
[1:25:13] and and all this. And there's a whole
[1:25:15] ton of stuff that nobody's ever taken
[1:25:18] the time to take this message and study
[1:25:21] it out for themselves.
[1:25:28] You're not worried. If God's for you,
[1:25:30] who can be against you?
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Be still.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; And know that I'm God.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to lean to your
[1:25:43] understanding. You don't have to rush
[1:25:45] into decisions.
[1:25:47] Acknowledge the Lord. He'll take care of
[1:25:49] you. He loves you. He died for you. He
[1:25:51] elected you. He puts your name on the
[1:25:54] lamb's book of life. He's not going to
[1:25:56] leave you nor forsake you.
[1:25:59] You can rest
[1:26:02] in his goodness.
[1:26:04] But what's he do? He vindicates
[1:26:08] his word and interprets it. How do you
[1:26:13] how do they do it
[1:26:16] get to this?
[1:26:19] They do it by their culture.
[1:26:22] their education
[1:26:24] of their understanding
[1:26:27] of the decree degree of doctor's degrees
[1:26:31] and so forth that they have come from
[1:26:35] some certain seminary and they learn
[1:26:38] these things.
[1:26:40] How do they get in that condition?
[1:26:43] How do they do it? culture,
[1:26:46] education,
[1:26:49] their understanding,
[1:26:53] degrees, and doctors and men that
[1:26:55] present themselves as being smarter and
[1:26:58] more spiritual.
[1:27:01] There's no man alive that's any more
[1:27:03] spiritual than any one of you.
[1:27:10] They all heard the same gospel you hear.
[1:27:13] They all were under the same blood that
[1:27:15] you're under.
[1:27:19] Don't sell yourself short.
[1:27:23] He says, and they come from certain
[1:27:26] seminary and learning these things. But
[1:27:28] look friends, listen. Nowhere in the
[1:27:31] Bible are we asked to understand.
[1:27:34] We are not asked to understand. We are
[1:27:37] asked to believe it.
[1:27:40] Believe it by what? by faith.
[1:27:44] If you understand it, then that makes
[1:27:47] faith anulled.
[1:27:49] You can't understand it, but you believe
[1:27:53] it anyhow. If you could understand God,
[1:27:57] I wouldn't have to believe God.
[1:28:01] I do not understand God. No man
[1:28:05] understands God. I cannot understand the
[1:28:09] word of God but I accept it. I believe
[1:28:13] it. I am not asked to under stand it.
[1:28:21] Now, I know I'm not good uh got a
[1:28:24] vocabulary to make this set in the way
[1:28:29] that I want to, but we know that
[1:28:34] that we're we are always trying to grasp
[1:28:41] an understanding
[1:28:44] that we can lean to.
[1:28:48] It's hard to go forward with faith.
[1:28:52] He said so that settles it.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; And then when you hear someone that I
[1:28:58] would think that understood God more
[1:29:02] than anybody say, "You can't understand
[1:29:05] God." He didn't ask you to understand
[1:29:08] it. He didn't ask you to comprehend it.
[1:29:11] He didn't ask you to know why. He just
[1:29:14] asked you to believe it. If he said it,
[1:29:17] you believe it. If he said it, he will
[1:29:20] bring it to pass. If he said it, it will
[1:29:23] happen. If it's a promise, God keeps his
[1:29:26] promise that you don't need to you don't
[1:29:28] need to compreh anything else. He said,
[1:29:31] "God will deliver me out of this
[1:29:32] trouble. He's a present help in the time
[1:29:35] of trouble. He's a God that supplieth
[1:29:37] all my needs." I don't understand that.
[1:29:41] I look in the mirror and I don't think
[1:29:43] God should give me a second of his time.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; But he chose to put the name on the
[1:29:51] lamb's book of life. He chose to die for
[1:29:54] me. He chose to pay the price for my
[1:29:56] sin. Not something I did. It's not
[1:29:59] something I earned. It's not something I
[1:30:01] understand. But until you believe he did
[1:30:04] it,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; you'll be locked in your own trying to
[1:30:09] understand the life that God doesn't
[1:30:11] even attribute to you.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; You're trying to understand a myth.
[1:30:20] My past is a myth.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; It's a vapor.
[1:30:36] I don't understand God. No man
[1:30:37] understands God. I can understand the
[1:30:40] word of God, but I accept it. I believe
[1:30:43] it. I'm not asked to understand it.
[1:30:47] I don't
[1:30:49] I don't went to no seminary
[1:30:53] and all these great understandings of
[1:30:55] man's knowledge on that. I just know
[1:30:58] that the Bible says that Jesus Christ is
[1:31:02] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:31:05] And I look for him in the same category.
[1:31:10] I know he promised that he would do it
[1:31:13] in this day. I look for him to do it and
[1:31:18] he does it. Is that right? He promised
[1:31:21] grace. I look for it and receive it. He
[1:31:26] promised healing. I believe it and I
[1:31:29] accept it and I receive it.
[1:31:34] He made a promise in this day
[1:31:37] and we accept it. Now, we're just going
[1:31:40] to take, if you would right now, we're
[1:31:42] going to we're going to just listen as
[1:31:46] he just told us God vindicates his word.
[1:31:49] And we're just going to sit back and
[1:31:51] just for a a moment. We could go on a
[1:31:54] lot more for we just want to listen to
[1:31:56] just 25 minutes this morning of leaning
[1:32:00] not to your own understanding
[1:32:03] but watching what God does and then
[1:32:06] we'll come back and close up with just
[1:32:09] about 15 or or 20 minutes. But let the
[1:32:13] word of God bless you this morning as we
[1:32:17] listen and go ahead brothers. Paragraph
[1:32:20] 171. lean not to your own understanding
[1:32:23] and we'll just listen. And he starts out
[1:32:25] with here's a man that leaned to his own
[1:32:28] understanding. Judas leaned to his own
[1:32:31] understanding
[1:32:33] and sold the King of Kings for 30 pieces
[1:32:38] of silver. Amen. Let's listen this
[1:32:40] morning.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; There was one man who did lean to his
[1:32:45] own understanding and his name was Judas
[1:32:46] Isachare.
[1:32:49] Oh, he
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. I
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; I don't see how he could have done it.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; He had walked face to face with Christ.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Just like Eve did in the beginning.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; He had seen the vindication. He had
[1:33:02] looked at God in the face like Eve did
[1:33:03] in the cool of the evening. Eve looked
[1:33:06] at Christ in the cool of the evening in
[1:33:08] the garden. And Judas had sat in the
[1:33:11] cool of the evening in the garden of
[1:33:13] Gethsemane and many places and had
[1:33:16] looked at the same Christ had heard him
[1:33:18] teach prove himself by the word
[1:33:21] vindicated to be the prophet that Moses
[1:33:23] spoke of be raised up and told him in
[1:33:26] the scripture who he was and all about
[1:33:27] it. They'd seen it proved by God that he
[1:33:29] was and then he leaned to his own
[1:33:33] understanding.
[1:33:35] H
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; how could he do it?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; It's because he never had it down here
[1:33:40] in the first place.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a Germanized seed.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; He was a son of predition.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Born out of predition, returned back to
[1:33:48] predition.
[1:33:50] Now we noticed, but he went out and
[1:33:52] maybe he might have had an idea of his
[1:33:54] understanding. He might have thought
[1:33:56] that Jesus, he had so much respect for
[1:33:58] him. Now, you know, I might sell him for
[1:34:00] 30 pieces of silver and if I do, I'll
[1:34:02] have some money. Now I can do something
[1:34:05] with that. And he's able to deliver
[1:34:07] himself. See, he didn't know in the
[1:34:09] scripture that he had raised up to take
[1:34:10] that same place. And neither does the
[1:34:12] people today realize what condition
[1:34:15] they're in. It's ordained for this lady
[1:34:17] or see a church to be in this condition.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Putting Christ on the outside and you
[1:34:22] knocking trying to get back in. No
[1:34:24] cooperation, no world. Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Vindicating his word in the day now like
[1:34:30] he did in everyday. and they walk right
[1:34:32] away from it, leaning to their own
[1:34:34] understanding. That's that's all there
[1:34:36] is to it. Or maybe, let's say this, that
[1:34:39] that he thought maybe if he did sell
[1:34:41] Christ for 30 pieces of silver, well, he
[1:34:44] would have a a fellowship with some of
[1:34:46] the great uh denominations of that day,
[1:34:49] the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[1:34:51] Uh he'd say, "Now wait, he can take care
[1:34:53] of himself. I've seen him in great
[1:34:55] battles. I I know that that he can take
[1:34:57] care of himself. So, I might make uh
[1:34:59] some money. kind of a a little
[1:35:01] retirement as it was and then again I
[1:35:04] might have a great standing with these
[1:35:08] churches today if I would betray him to
[1:35:10] him. See, but he leaned to his own
[1:35:12] understanding instead of the
[1:35:14] understanding that that was the
[1:35:16] vindicated word of God. And he did to
[1:35:19] Jesus just what the scriptures said he
[1:35:21] would do. And today the church world has
[1:35:25] turned Christ out in this last days just
[1:35:28] exactly like the book of Revelation said
[1:35:30] they would do it.
[1:35:32] It's the spirit of Judas again and form
[1:35:35] of church having a form of godliness but
[1:35:38] denying the word.
[1:35:40] That's right now.
[1:35:43] Oh my. What did it result in? Death.
[1:35:48] Just like it did to Eve. And it does to
[1:35:50] all others who tries to uh pervert the
[1:35:54] word of God and lean to their own
[1:35:56] understanding. Even now they settle not
[1:35:59] for 30 pieces of silver but maybe become
[1:36:02] oh some great officer some seminary
[1:36:05] experience wouldn't even worth 30 pieces
[1:36:07] of silver but they sell it anyhow. Sell
[1:36:10] their understanding of God out for such
[1:36:12] a thing as that. How different from the
[1:36:14] great learned St. Paul who had all the
[1:36:17] knowledge he could brag about. But he
[1:36:20] said, "I've turned the whole thing of my
[1:36:23] reasons down.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I met a pillar of fire one day on the
[1:36:26] road to the next." Bless the Lord. And
[1:36:29] he said, "I never come to you with
[1:36:30] excellency of speech. Because if I did,
[1:36:33] you'd trust in the wisdom of man. But I
[1:36:35] come to you in the power and
[1:36:38] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost that
[1:36:40] you would lean upon the word of God."
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "If an angel from heaven
[1:36:46] come preach any other thing, let him be
[1:36:48] cursed."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Galatians 18.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; No, sir. He never the little woman at
[1:36:54] the well, she was immoral.
[1:36:57] But she knowed that the churches had
[1:36:58] excommunicated her and but she never
[1:37:01] leaned upon her own understanding. When
[1:37:04] she met this one at the well who told
[1:37:06] her all the sins that she had done, she
[1:37:08] run into the city. Now, it wasn't right
[1:37:10] for a woman to do that, to go in and say
[1:37:12] anything because she was a prostitute.
[1:37:13] But when she had met Jesus, she never
[1:37:15] leaned to the understanding of the
[1:37:17] people that day. She'd come said, "Come
[1:37:19] see a man who told me the things I've
[1:37:21] done. Isn't this the very Messiah?"
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; She never leaned upon her understanding.
[1:37:27] No.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; The Virgin Mary, when the angel Gabriel
[1:37:31] met her and told her that she's going to
[1:37:34] have a baby without knowing a man,
[1:37:38] never been.
[1:37:41] She never leaned up on her own
[1:37:43] understanding that a woman could not
[1:37:44] have a baby without having uh a husband.
[1:37:49] She didn't lean upon that. But she said,
[1:37:51] "Behold the hands made of the Lord."
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to your word.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; She didn't say, "How am I going to do
[1:37:58] it? When I'm going to do it, and how's
[1:37:59] this all going to take place?" The angel
[1:38:01] said, "The Holy Ghost shall overshadow
[1:38:03] thee, and that holy thing will be born
[1:38:05] to thee. Shall be called the Son of
[1:38:07] God." She said, "Behold, the hands made
[1:38:08] of the Lord."
[1:38:10] She didn't take her reasoning said it
[1:38:11] couldn't be done. She just said,
[1:38:13] "Behold, the hands made of the Lord."
[1:38:15] That's right. Notice the the woman that
[1:38:18] had the blood issue,
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; the doctor told her said, "There's no
[1:38:21] hope." She spent all of her living with
[1:38:23] the physicians and none of them could
[1:38:26] help her. And she didn't lean upon that.
[1:38:29] When Jesus, she walked through the crowd
[1:38:31] and she said, "I believe if I can touch
[1:38:33] that man's garments, I'll be made well."
[1:38:36] She goes over now. Wait. The doctor said
[1:38:38] you can't get well. She'd had this blood
[1:38:40] issue for years and years. She got
[1:38:42] weaker all time and worse. The doctors
[1:38:44] to give her up. That's all the
[1:38:46] understanding they had. But she said by
[1:38:48] faith. There's no scripture telling her
[1:38:51] to do that. But she said, "If I could
[1:38:53] touch the border of his garment, I'll be
[1:38:56] made well."
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And she slipped around and touched him.
[1:39:00] She walked back, sat down. Jesus turned
[1:39:02] around said, "Who touched me?"
[1:39:05] He looked around till he found her. He
[1:39:07] told her of her blood issue and she felt
[1:39:10] at that moment in her own body. She
[1:39:12] couldn't prove it then, but she felt in
[1:39:14] her own body that her blood issue
[1:39:15] stopped. She never reasoned. If the
[1:39:18] doctor had turned her down, how could
[1:39:20] anything else help her? She never went
[1:39:22] to reason, but she went to faith. Now,
[1:39:25] the Bible says that he's the high priest
[1:39:28] today that can be touched by the feeling
[1:39:30] of our infirmities.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:39:33] Don't go to reason say oh that's he said
[1:39:35] today he said he is right now a high
[1:39:38] priest that can be touched by the
[1:39:40] feeling of our infirmities the same
[1:39:42] yesterday today and forever what do you
[1:39:45] think when I was out there as a Baptist
[1:39:47] preacher and that angel of the Lord met
[1:39:50] me out there and commission me to go do
[1:39:52] this that I'm doing
[1:39:54] well my pastor said you've gone crazy
[1:39:57] what you had a nightmare you I said you
[1:39:59] better take my fellowship card right Um,
[1:40:02] now he said, "How can you with not even
[1:40:05] a grammar school education
[1:40:07] preach around the world?
[1:40:10] How can you ever pray for kings and pop
[1:40:13] takes and you you you can't even use
[1:40:15] your grammar, right?" I wasn't trusting
[1:40:18] in my grammar.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; I wasn't trusting in the ability I had.
[1:40:22] I was commissioned.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I didn't go to reasons.
[1:40:27] If I had to listen to reasons that
[1:40:29] probably been thousands of people died
[1:40:31] years ago, but I carried a message
[1:40:33] exactly like he said around and around
[1:40:36] the world. And I'm going again by the
[1:40:38] grace of God. Not by reasons, but by
[1:40:41] commission. Hallelujah. I lean not. You
[1:40:43] say you're 55 years old. If I was 95,
[1:40:46] that don't mean a thing.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; He's still the same God that he was of
[1:40:51] Abraham.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; That's her. Lean not to your own
[1:40:54] understanding.
[1:40:56] And after the sign went forth and the
[1:40:58] voice followed the churches began to
[1:41:00] turn me down and close your doors upon
[1:41:01] doctrine that any of them is daring to
[1:41:03] stand before me to say it's right or
[1:41:05] wrong.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; I challenge any of them.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Not to be smart, but I know where I'm
[1:41:10] at.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:13] What did they do? What did they do to
[1:41:15] shut every door? Now what are you going
[1:41:16] to do? The other day up on the mountain,
[1:41:18] I was standing there. I said, "Lord, I
[1:41:19] got one open door in the whole nation."
[1:41:21] As far as I know, that's Phoenix,
[1:41:23] Arizona. He's the only one I got. And I
[1:41:26] start down off mountain just as plain as
[1:41:28] I ever heard anybody speak. He said,
[1:41:29] "What's that to thee? Follow thou me."
[1:41:33] Not upon my own understanding. I lean
[1:41:36] upon his promise.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Oh friend.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Don't lean upon reasons. Then you cry
[1:41:44] out with Eddie Puit of all. All hail the
[1:41:47] power of Jesus name. Let angels
[1:41:49] prostrate Paul. Bring forth the royal
[1:41:51] diadem and crown him Lord of all. Amen.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Found him. Lord of all.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't lean upon what you
[1:42:02] think, what somebody else think. By
[1:42:05] faith, accept the promise of God.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Will you do it?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Now, it isn't whether somebody else did
[1:42:10] it or they did do it. But what about
[1:42:12] you?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; What will you do with this Jesus called
[1:42:15] the Christ that makes itself known in
[1:42:17] this day as same as he did in that day?
[1:42:20] Do you believe him? Let us pray. Lord
[1:42:23] Jesus, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, God
[1:42:28] of God. Thank you. God of all
[1:42:31] potentates, the first, the last, the
[1:42:33] Alpha, Omega, the beginning and the
[1:42:34] ending, the bright morning star, the
[1:42:36] rose of Sharon, Lily, the valley, root
[1:42:38] and offspring of David. Come Lord God,
[1:42:41] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:42:45] Bless this crowd of people, Lord. This
[1:42:48] is just getting ready to start tomorrow.
[1:42:50] We've had a little meeting here and
[1:42:53] you've blessed us in it. You've made
[1:42:54] yourself known to us.
[1:42:57] I pray God that you will continue to
[1:43:00] make yourself known to us.
[1:43:03] Bless us tonight. Help us now. We are
[1:43:06] needy people. Lord, thou know us. I
[1:43:09] don't like to scold people,
[1:43:12] but how can I hush that holy burning
[1:43:18] blessing? I don't like to do that. Lord,
[1:43:20] you know my life, my heart.
[1:43:24] I must do it. And I pray, God, that
[1:43:27] you'll help me to do it. Just give me
[1:43:29] grace and never let me lean to my own
[1:43:32] understanding, but let me lean upon thy
[1:43:35] promise in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:43:40] I want you everyone to be real reverent
[1:43:42] just for a few minutes.
[1:43:46] In this crowd of people, there's men and
[1:43:48] women sitting here, no doubt, who are
[1:43:49] sick.
[1:43:51] How many is sick and afflicted in here?
[1:43:52] Raise up your hands. Just say, "I am in
[1:43:55] need of God." Just raise up your hand.
[1:43:57] I'm in need of God. Now, I don't know
[1:44:01] very many people. I know these three
[1:44:02] boys sitting right here. I know Mr. Dao
[1:44:06] and his wife sitting there. I think I
[1:44:09] think this is Sister Moore. I'm not
[1:44:11] sure. Is that right, Sister Moore?
[1:44:13] Outside of that, I guess that doesn't
[1:44:15] brother Mikey and a platform. That's as
[1:44:18] far as I see that I know. But the
[1:44:20] heavenly father who promised and in this
[1:44:23] day he would vindicate himself in this
[1:44:26] age just exactly the way he did at
[1:44:30] Sodom.
[1:44:32] Did he promise it manifest himself? Do
[1:44:35] you believe that?
[1:44:38] Now if you will pray and by faith now
[1:44:42] don't try to reason how can I touch him
[1:44:44] as a high priest. Now the Bible said the
[1:44:47] New Testament he is a high priest right
[1:44:49] now. He continues a high priest at the
[1:44:52] order of Melazdc.
[1:44:54] He's a high priest forever. There's no
[1:44:57] other high priest but him. No other
[1:44:59] mediator between God and man but the man
[1:45:01] in Christ.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. He is the only one and he
[1:45:06] is the same. yesterday, today, and
[1:45:08] forever. Now, if he remains that same
[1:45:10] high priest, and the Bible said we can
[1:45:13] touch him by the feeling of our
[1:45:14] infirmities like that little woman did
[1:45:16] that touched his garment, your faith can
[1:45:19] touch him tonight, and he'll act the
[1:45:21] same way in human flesh like he did when
[1:45:23] he was in human flesh there at at
[1:45:26] Abraham's oak. You believe that?
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; He promised he would do it.
[1:45:32] I just prayed anybody has a need and I I
[1:45:36] it's like I said a gift is not something
[1:45:38] it's like you take a knife and if you
[1:45:40] want to cut this with it you can cut it
[1:45:42] or you cut this you can cut it or
[1:45:44] whatever you want to that's not a gift
[1:45:45] of God see no a gift of God is some way
[1:45:50] you have of getting yourself out of the
[1:45:52] way and gifts and callings are the
[1:45:55] predestination of God gifts and callings
[1:45:57] are even without repentance you're born
[1:45:59] with them a little gear that you pull
[1:46:02] yourself over in, but you cannot step on
[1:46:04] the pedal. God has to operate it. You
[1:46:08] have to get yourself out of the way.
[1:46:09] Your faith can operate it, not mine.
[1:46:11] Yours, mine just takes it out of the
[1:46:14] way. You believe with all your heart
[1:46:16] that Jesus Christ lives today. Don't
[1:46:19] lean to your own understanding. You say,
[1:46:21] "Well, look, I I'm in serious shape,
[1:46:23] brother. You don't know me. I've been
[1:46:24] this wheelchair. I've been I don't care
[1:46:26] what you've been." and see if God won't
[1:46:30] come down and do exactly like he did
[1:46:33] when he was here on earth in a physical
[1:46:35] body. He'll do it in your body and my
[1:46:38] body together as a unit believing in
[1:46:40] him. He'll do it because he promised he
[1:46:43] would do it.
[1:46:45] I don't lean to what somebody says, "Oh,
[1:46:46] that's that's uh mental telep
[1:47:02] are places we don't have to have that to
[1:47:04] come up and lay hands on people. We laid
[1:47:06] hands on them last night. But the only
[1:47:08] thing you have to have is faith and then
[1:47:10] recognize by faith you accept it. by
[1:47:14] faith. Not not anything is don't say,
[1:47:16] "Well, how can it be done?" If I could
[1:47:19] tell you how it was done, then it
[1:47:20] wouldn't be no more faith.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's done. I don't
[1:47:24] know, but I believe it. I I don't know
[1:47:27] how how uh God saves a sinner, but he
[1:47:30] does it. I don't know how God does any
[1:47:33] of these things, but I accept it. He He
[1:47:36] does it. That's way because I can't
[1:47:37] explain it now. Well, I never will be
[1:47:40] explained. No one can because if you do
[1:47:42] then there's no more faith. I don't see
[1:47:44] how God and Christ could be the same
[1:47:46] person. But they were.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Scripture said, "You can't explain it."
[1:47:51] But they were.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; My father is in me. It's not me doing
[1:47:54] the works as my father in me.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; If I do not his works, then that shows
[1:47:58] I'm not of him. But if I do his works,
[1:48:00] then he testifies himself that I'm of
[1:48:02] him. Well,
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; it's the same thing now.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly the same thing. He's the same
[1:48:06] yesterday, today, and forever. If you'll
[1:48:08] believe me.
[1:48:12] Now, there's a man sitting right here
[1:48:13] before me.
[1:48:15] He's got dark hair.
[1:48:18] He's got a watch on his arm, a dark
[1:48:20] suit. He's wearing glasses. You can look
[1:48:23] right here. You see me sitting there
[1:48:24] with his eyes closed praying.
[1:48:27] I don't know that man. That heavenly
[1:48:30] father knows I don't know him.
[1:48:33] But I'm just going to look to him this
[1:48:34] pre because he look like he's so sincere
[1:48:36] saying there ever since I made mention
[1:48:39] that man just closed his eyes and
[1:48:41] started praying. That man is a stranger
[1:48:44] to me. That's to my hands.
[1:48:47] I don't know him. God knows that man
[1:48:51] and he can reveal to me if that promise
[1:48:55] is true in the Bible. He can reveal to
[1:48:58] me what that man's got his eyes closed
[1:49:00] for and what he's praying about. Do you
[1:49:02] believe that?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, sir? Uh, if you open
[1:49:06] your eyes, you're sitting right here.
[1:49:08] Look right here. You believe that?
[1:49:14] Now, you know, I don't know you. We're
[1:49:15] strangers to each other, but God knows
[1:49:19] you.
[1:49:21] I started crying. We because I can tell
[1:49:25] him now that God's going to answer his
[1:49:27] request. See, because that was what
[1:49:29] struck him to then that light from
[1:49:31] darkness changed to light.
[1:49:34] Now the man, he's praying for somebody
[1:49:37] else. And that's this little boy sitting
[1:49:39] over here by
[1:49:41] his son
[1:49:44] right now. That little boy is suffering
[1:49:47] with a a stomach disorder and also
[1:49:50] something wrong with his intestines.
[1:49:53] Right.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Right.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus, that's such a good
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; They're not from here. You're not from
[1:50:02] Arizona. You're from California, right?
[1:50:05] And you're a minister
[1:50:08] and your fellowship is with the
[1:50:09] Assemblies of God. That's true.
[1:50:14] Reverend Mccay is your name. A Reverend
[1:50:16] K. That's right. Is that true? Wave your
[1:50:19] hands like this.
[1:50:21] Now, your little boy is going to get
[1:50:22] well.
[1:50:24] Your faith. Now what? Now there's the
[1:50:27] man with his hands up. He knows me. I
[1:50:29] don't know him. But what was it? He
[1:50:32] touched the high priest.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Now see, he couldn't lean to his owner.
[1:50:37] Now what he's got to do, what does he do
[1:50:39] now? He's got to believe that what was
[1:50:40] told him the truth because he knows he
[1:50:42] knows not me.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Here, here sets a woman
[1:50:47] sitting right down here in front of me.
[1:50:49] Also, she's got her head bowed.
[1:50:53] She's suffering with a cancer.
[1:50:57] She also comes from California.
[1:51:00] I hope she don't miss this. Miss Adams,
[1:51:05] that's her name.
[1:51:07] I never seen her in my life.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:51:22] There's a lady sitting right back out
[1:51:24] here. I can't just put my point to her,
[1:51:26] but I see the light hanging over. She's
[1:51:29] deeply in trouble. She got trouble with
[1:51:31] her neck for one thing. And another
[1:51:34] thing, she's she's got uh a spiritual
[1:51:38] troubles where she's troubling about.
[1:51:41] And she's got a domestic trouble.
[1:51:45] Her daughter just run away.
[1:51:49] That's right.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; That's true, isn't it? She's got her
[1:51:53] hand up, Miss Miller. That is right. You
[1:51:58] believe God will send her back, heal
[1:52:01] your body. I never seen her in my life.
[1:52:04] She's a completely a total stranger.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:52:10] [Music]
[1:52:11] Here's
[1:52:15] a lady sitting here,
[1:52:18] the audience. She She's not from here.
[1:52:22] She also is from California.
[1:52:25] She's got cancer and the cancer is on
[1:52:28] her breast.
[1:52:30] She's been operated on one breast and
[1:52:33] it's went to the other.
[1:52:36] Right,
[1:52:38] Miss Ken?
[1:52:40] That is right. You believe it. God will
[1:52:41] make you well.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; You believe it. I'm a stranger to you,
[1:52:44] lady. I don't know you.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; That's true. She's camp.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; You might know that God is present.
[1:52:51] There's a lady sitting right next to
[1:52:53] her. Her name is Mrs. Harris.
[1:52:58] She's a total stranger to me. But when
[1:53:00] the spirit struck this woman, she also
[1:53:03] in sympathy with her. And she comes from
[1:53:06] California. That's right. And she's got
[1:53:08] trouble with her shoulder. That's right.
[1:53:11] You believe that God will heal you. If
[1:53:13] that's true, raise up your hand so the
[1:53:15] people can total stranger.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Lean not to your own understanding. What
[1:53:21] can do that? You can't explain that.
[1:53:23] That's a paradox.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; It's beyond explaining. Ask those
[1:53:27] people. And I never seen them in my
[1:53:28] life. Never know nothing about them. It
[1:53:30] could just go on through the I mean, but
[1:53:32] now look, don't lean to your own
[1:53:34] understanding, but lean to what he
[1:53:37] promised that he would do that. If that
[1:53:39] isn't the same spirit that was dwelling
[1:53:41] in human flesh that know that Sarah
[1:53:43] laughed in the tent behind the man. Is
[1:53:46] that right?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And he promised just before the world
[1:53:50] was destroyed with fire when the son of
[1:53:53] man would reveal himself again in like
[1:53:56] manner as it the son of man prophetic
[1:53:59] would reveal himself in human flesh like
[1:54:02] he is here with us tonight as he did
[1:54:04] then.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Now what hour are we living in?
[1:54:08] just near the destruction.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't stand in here no longer a
[1:54:13] sinner. Accept Jesus Christ while you're
[1:54:16] in his presence.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I know usually it's customary for
[1:54:20] ministers to make please and tell
[1:54:22] stories about mother that's dead and
[1:54:24] gone on. That's all right. But we don't
[1:54:26] come upon the basis of our mother being
[1:54:28] dead. My mother's dead too. My father
[1:54:31] also. But we come up intelligently
[1:54:35] accepting upon the basis of God
[1:54:38] manifesting himself in Jesus Christ to
[1:54:40] take away the sins of the world. We come
[1:54:43] and believe upon the atonement. And
[1:54:45] while he has a vindicated his word, I
[1:54:48] don't care what church you've gone to,
[1:54:49] Methodist, Baptist, Catholic,
[1:54:51] Presbyterian, or no church at all. If
[1:54:53] you will admit that you have understood
[1:54:56] it different and know that you really
[1:54:58] never have been born again but you want
[1:55:00] to be and want to accept it now the
[1:55:03] promise now you might not be filled now
[1:55:05] but you will be filled when the as the
[1:55:07] meetings goes on you want to accept it
[1:55:09] upon those bases would you stand up to
[1:55:11] your feet let me just offer prayer for
[1:55:12] you right where you're standing everyone
[1:55:14] in here that knows don't lean on your
[1:55:16] own say I spoke in tongues that don't
[1:55:20] have nothing to do with it I believe in
[1:55:21] speaking in tongues too But I've seen
[1:55:23] witches, devils, and everything else
[1:55:24] speaking tongue interpretation.
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:27] That's right. Ask the missionaries down
[1:55:29] here. We can find out. Brother Creature,
[1:55:31] you know that's right. I've seen him
[1:55:33] speak in tongues and drink blood out of
[1:55:34] a human skull. Call him the devil. Sure.
[1:55:38] I've seen them lay a pencil down and
[1:55:40] they get up and write in unknown tongues
[1:55:42] and a w the wizard stand there and
[1:55:43] interpret it. So speaking in tongues is
[1:55:46] no sign you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. that if you speak in tongues and
[1:55:51] deny this word, there's something wrong
[1:55:53] somewhere.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Don't lean to your own understanding.
[1:55:57] Somebody might you say, "Well, I
[1:55:59] shouted." I do, too.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; But don't lean to that. I've seen all
[1:56:03] kinds of demon power shout and scream.
[1:56:06] I've seen Muhammads shout and scream
[1:56:08] till they work theirel in such a place
[1:56:09] they can run splinters through their
[1:56:11] hands in India. I've seen them scream
[1:56:12] and jump up and down and take balls of
[1:56:14] water with hooks in it and push it
[1:56:16] through their skin and walk on hot fire
[1:56:17] coals.
[1:56:19] Right?
[1:56:21] Denying Jesus Christ.
[1:56:24] See, don't lean to your own
[1:56:25] understanding, but upon the word of God.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; If your life doesn't cope with this
[1:56:30] Bible to believe every word that's in
[1:56:32] there, and you want to believe it and
[1:56:34] want God to work his will through you
[1:56:36] because you can be a part of God, will
[1:56:38] you stand and say, "I will accept it
[1:56:39] right now, brother."
[1:56:41] Thank you. Thank you. God bless you. God
[1:56:44] bless you.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:56:48] God bless you. Wonderful. God bless you.
[1:56:50] May God grant you all these sincere. You
[1:56:53] say just just keep standing. just you
[1:56:54] see
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; now it's it's based upon that that I'd
[1:57:04] just like to close up with just uh
[1:57:11] uh
[1:57:14] a thought about
[1:57:18] this message
[1:57:20] and
[1:57:21] our approach
[1:57:24] to it.
[1:57:26] And you know,
[1:57:29] so many times
[1:57:31] our approach to life is
[1:57:37] is our life. We we look back
[1:57:42] and we look at what's around us.
[1:57:46] That's our our nature.
[1:57:49] We're trying to perceive what's going
[1:57:52] on. We're trying to understand our
[1:57:54] lives. We're trying to understand
[1:57:58] the way out and and our our the whole uh
[1:58:04] the whole comprehension if I could say
[1:58:07] it uh uh uh that way of where that we
[1:58:11] are
[1:58:12] and and we want to go forward from where
[1:58:16] that we are. I I want to be more
[1:58:19] spiritual, right? I I I have my natural
[1:58:22] life, but he said that there was a
[1:58:25] spiritual life and and I want that man
[1:58:29] to grow.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; We We have the outer man and then we
[1:58:33] have the inner man and the flesh wars
[1:58:37] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:58:39] against the flesh. And if I'm not
[1:58:42] careful, I get caught up in that battle
[1:58:46] and I'm trying to understand it. I'm
[1:58:48] trying to figure out a way out of it.
[1:58:51] I'm trying to uh I'm trying to struggle
[1:58:54] to to understand myself and understand
[1:58:59] why I'm that way. And I find that that
[1:59:02] in in doing so that I'm not looking
[1:59:05] forward.
[1:59:08] Do you understand? But I'm just I just
[1:59:10] am looking I'm looking back and I'm
[1:59:14] looking around.
[1:59:16] And I I I thought of this uh so much
[1:59:21] because I I noticed something in in
[1:59:25] life. And
[1:59:27] I noticed uh something that has become
[1:59:33] a a great um move in our our country and
[1:59:39] our and business and everything. And
[1:59:43] it's it's what they call a life coach.
[1:59:48] And executives and companies are hiring
[1:59:52] what they call life coaches.
[1:59:56] you know, someone that will sit down and
[1:59:58] and not a therapist like does
[2:00:02] distinguishes a a a mental condition,
[2:00:07] but it it's someone to help people
[2:00:12] navigate
[2:00:13] through life's
[2:00:16] situations and circumstances.
[2:00:19] So they want to someone that can sit
[2:00:22] down and talk it over with them and and
[2:00:25] and reason it out with them and and give
[2:00:29] them perspective and and it's become a
[2:00:32] multibillion
[2:00:34] dollar business. People are looking for
[2:00:40] a life coach,
[2:00:42] somebody to help them move forward.
[2:00:46] So we have the whole world out there who
[2:00:50] who now is in such a struggle. They they
[2:00:54] they they've
[2:00:57] got this uh artificial intelligence
[2:01:01] that uh uh you know people are afraid
[2:01:06] of. You know it's going to do away with
[2:01:08] jobs. You know now they have articles
[2:01:11] are out there everywhere. uh you know if
[2:01:15] if you if you choose this career it's
[2:01:18] going to be gone in five years if you if
[2:01:21] you do this you know these are certain
[2:01:24] jobs that AI won't take over you know
[2:01:26] they show a guy with the jackhammer and
[2:01:28] they show a guy with a you know don't
[2:01:31] don't
[2:01:33] man will try to do everything
[2:01:37] you know they got a machine and you can
[2:01:39] just do like this and it goes over and
[2:01:41] the arm comes something jackhammer or
[2:01:43] something and you sit back there and do
[2:01:46] it, they can fly a drone into your
[2:01:48] window in your house.
[2:01:53] People are being bound by fear.
[2:01:58] Life's become so uncertain to them.
[2:02:01] But but we just listen
[2:02:04] for a few moments this morning of
[2:02:06] something that was so sure and so
[2:02:10] proven. God made a promise in his word.
[2:02:14] Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, Malachi
[2:02:18] 4:5. in this last day that God would do
[2:02:22] the same works that he did in the
[2:02:24] ministry of a son of man that he would
[2:02:27] prophetically come back in the office of
[2:02:30] the prophet and do the same things that
[2:02:34] Jesus did when he was here that the
[2:02:37] Gentiles would be able to see the same
[2:02:40] thing come to pass.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; And he did it right
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; and we witnessed it.
[2:02:48] We heard it. Those people existed. I
[2:02:51] thought that somebody brought it up
[2:02:53] preaching the other day about, you know,
[2:02:55] all these names were written right
[2:02:57] there. But no, they wait till those
[2:03:00] people aren't there to ask anymore.
[2:03:04] You know, I believe brother uh Ronnie uh
[2:03:08] he heard the story. He just came to the
[2:03:10] message. He heard the story of Haddie,
[2:03:11] right? I believe it was. And he called
[2:03:13] her up,
[2:03:16] talked to her on the phone.
[2:03:18] And she said, "That's exactly right. I
[2:03:20] was sick. I was in this condition.
[2:03:21] Brother Bram Cra me and bore witness to
[2:03:24] it."
[2:03:26] But but people nowadays they actually
[2:03:31] lean to their own understanding
[2:03:35] and it causes them they're so to the
[2:03:38] place
[2:03:40] you understand that they've got to be
[2:03:43] able to use their mind
[2:03:46] and think about it and perceive about
[2:03:49] it. They don't want to let go into the
[2:03:53] arms of faith.
[2:03:57] They don't even want to believe that
[2:03:58] they're called, that they're elected,
[2:04:02] that they're chosen.
[2:04:05] Their their understanding has to come up
[2:04:08] with some way to measure that. There is
[2:04:11] no measuring it.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; He says, I've accepted it on one basis
[2:04:18] only that God said so. I can't explain
[2:04:22] it. I don't know why.
[2:04:24] He said, "A gift isn't something you can
[2:04:26] put the press your pedal on and make it
[2:04:30] happen. It's getting yourself out of the
[2:04:32] way and letting God do it." I've seen it
[2:04:36] many times in my life.
[2:04:41] People come for prayer. I just pray
[2:04:45] and in my prayer, I might say, "Lord,
[2:04:47] help this person. You know, they've got
[2:04:50] all the troubles they have at home,
[2:04:52] their children, whatever." I just say
[2:04:53] the prayer and it's exactly what they
[2:04:56] need. That ain't man. You don't know
[2:04:59] that. You can't figure that out. You
[2:05:01] don't understand it. But we not we don't
[2:05:03] go by that. But you got the whole world
[2:05:07] nowadays
[2:05:10] looking to grasp
[2:05:13] a way forward.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:05:18] And so they're seeking out
[2:05:21] people to advise them.
[2:05:26] And that's the blind leading the blind.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; They're paying billions and millions of
[2:05:35] dollars.
[2:05:37] Corporations are hiring what they call
[2:05:40] life coaches. So, the people can go in
[2:05:43] and sit in and have uh the life coach
[2:05:49] motivate them. Here's some of the things
[2:05:51] that they hire a life coach to do. If
[2:05:54] you're frequently irritable,
[2:05:58] they figure you need a life coach.
[2:06:01] If you have high levels of stress or
[2:06:04] anxiety,
[2:06:07] inability to break bad habits,
[2:06:10] lack of fulfillment in your social life,
[2:06:15] persistence, feelings of dissatisfaction
[2:06:19] at work,
[2:06:21] a sense of blocked creativity.
[2:06:29] It says, "In recent years, life coaches
[2:06:32] have gained more mainstream recognition.
[2:06:36] A growing number of creative executive
[2:06:40] entrepreneurs
[2:06:42] are now trying to life coaches turning
[2:06:46] to life coaches to help them attain
[2:06:49] success in their professions and their
[2:06:53] personal lives.
[2:06:56] They're looking for him to help them
[2:06:57] make decisions,
[2:06:59] deal with obstacles and relationships,
[2:07:03] work their way
[2:07:05] through uh different difficult
[2:07:09] situations.
[2:07:13] They they they need they need a life
[2:07:16] coach.
[2:07:18] And I I thought back and I sat there and
[2:07:21] I thought, you know,
[2:07:24] Lord, maybe that's what I need.
[2:07:30] I I I've got
[2:07:32] I need a life coach.
[2:07:36] I need someone to coach my life,
[2:07:40] to tell me how to work through this and
[2:07:42] tell me how to work through that and and
[2:07:44] and you know, talk it over with and and
[2:07:48] and all all those things. And I
[2:07:51] realized, he says, "Yeah, but why is
[2:07:53] that?" Because you you you you don't
[2:07:55] look forward.
[2:07:59] You don't look to what's coming. You
[2:08:01] don't look to what's ahead of you. You
[2:08:03] feel you need a life coach. And then it
[2:08:05] just struck me like like I can't sleep.
[2:08:07] I've got a life coach
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; that this message
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; was sent to be my life coach,
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; you know. But sometimes I don't look at
[2:08:24] it that way.
[2:08:26] I I don't look at it as somebody as a
[2:08:30] message that God's given me to coach my
[2:08:34] life. In sports, they have a coach. And
[2:08:38] the coach looks for little things that
[2:08:40] you can do and you can change.
[2:08:43] Quarterbacks, it's all about your
[2:08:45] footwork. You know, in other words, how
[2:08:47] that you come away from the the
[2:08:49] football. a guy that throws the ball. If
[2:08:52] he comes back a certain way, everybody
[2:08:55] knows it's a pass.
[2:08:57] So, the defensive m linemen are there
[2:09:00] and they're looking at his feet.
[2:09:03] And if he starts this mo motion right
[2:09:05] off of the thing, they know it's a pass.
[2:09:08] So, the coach teaches them how to come
[2:09:11] back in such a manner that they don't
[2:09:15] know whether it's a pass or not. So,
[2:09:18] they don't know if it's going to be play
[2:09:20] action. You didn't know to look at the
[2:09:22] feet, did you? You know what you needed?
[2:09:24] You needed a coach.
[2:09:29] See, all the things that get by in life
[2:09:33] and so they they they go back a
[2:09:35] different way so they can make a fake
[2:09:38] for a play action. So, can all a
[2:09:42] experience. So they have all these
[2:09:43] little things in basketball.
[2:09:46] You know, a team won a championship
[2:09:49] because the coach gave the guy one word
[2:09:52] of advice.
[2:09:54] He said, "Everybody knows that when you
[2:09:57] dribble the ball and you lean in with
[2:10:00] your shoulder that you're going to go
[2:10:02] step back and do a drop back pass."
[2:10:06] He said, 'Why don't you instead of
[2:10:09] leaning in with your shoulder
[2:10:12] and stepping back, just leaning your
[2:10:15] shoulder and go to the basket,
[2:10:18] you just might draw the foul.
[2:10:22] And he took that advice
[2:10:25] from that life coach. Brother Brandham
[2:10:28] used the example of sports, so I'm okay.
[2:10:33] But I want you to understand.
[2:10:37] And so he did that. He went he leaned in
[2:10:40] his shoulder and like he did 990 times
[2:10:44] before, he didn't. He went to the
[2:10:46] basket, drew the foul, won the
[2:10:49] championship
[2:10:52] cuz somebody gave him the little
[2:10:55] steps in life. how to deal with
[2:10:58] adversity,
[2:11:00] how to deal through situations. And I
[2:11:03] thought back, you know, I just sometimes
[2:11:05] I don't go to the message
[2:11:08] and listen to the message,
[2:11:12] not just for what I believe. And I I
[2:11:15] keep listening to the message as it's
[2:11:18] talking about the past and as it's
[2:11:22] talking about the present,
[2:11:25] the conditions that things are in, where
[2:11:28] it came from, what he dealt with. But I
[2:11:30] never understood
[2:11:32] that along with that in that message is
[2:11:36] a love letter.
[2:11:39] It's him whispering secrets
[2:11:42] in my ear. In other words, he's actually
[2:11:46] being a life coach to me.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; If I can begin to perceive it that way,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; if I be can begin to listen to it that
[2:11:59] way, if I can begin to say this isn't
[2:12:02] just something that was,
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; this isn't something that's just a point
[2:12:07] out how things are. This is something
[2:12:10] that can lead me forward and make me
[2:12:13] achieve that which I desire to achieve.
[2:12:17] Give me satisfaction in my life. Give me
[2:12:20] satisfaction in my work. Help me get
[2:12:22] through every difficulty and everything.
[2:12:24] It is my life coach.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; And I thought I just started thinking of
[2:12:32] some of the titles
[2:12:35] of the message.
[2:12:37] perseverance.
[2:12:44] A life coach would sit there and tell
[2:12:45] me, you know, don't expect results. You
[2:12:47] got to stick with it. What are they
[2:12:49] trying to do? Encourage them, lift them
[2:12:51] up, support them.
[2:12:54] You know, I found out with God,
[2:12:57] everything from him is free.
[2:13:02] How about if that's that doesn't just
[2:13:05] become a thought about all the guys that
[2:13:08] pert but what happens when that becomes
[2:13:11] a life coach to me and man it's not
[2:13:14] telling me about perseverance and about
[2:13:18] those who persevered and about those who
[2:13:22] overcame
[2:13:23] you know but I start looking at it as
[2:13:25] wait this is my life coach
[2:13:30] telling me I need to stick with things
[2:13:33] that I start.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; I don't need to run from pillar to post.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; People get life coaches so they can find
[2:13:44] their calling.
[2:13:47] They have all kinds of questions so
[2:13:50] people say, "What am I called for? I I
[2:13:53] want fulfillment beyond my job.
[2:13:59] because they're hungry.
[2:14:01] And then I said, I thought, I've got a
[2:14:03] life coach. This message is not only the
[2:14:07] fulfillment of the word of God, but he
[2:14:10] promised me he'd be a counselor,
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; the prince of my peace,
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; that that he would lead and guide me
[2:14:24] into all truth and righteousness.
[2:14:28] That he'd give me peace that surpassed
[2:14:31] understanding and joy unspeakable. All
[2:14:35] these things that these people are
[2:14:37] looking for a life coach to give to him,
[2:14:39] we have.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; And he it wasn't a life coach from
[2:14:44] another age. It was a life coach in our
[2:14:47] age. And he gave us the word for our
[2:14:50] age. I thought of of of
[2:14:54] not just a a sermon, but looking at this
[2:14:58] sermon as a way of advice to me. Amen.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; A way of advice for me to go forward. A
[2:15:07] way of advice. In other words, this
[2:15:09] sermon is coaching me.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; It's telling me of things I can do,
[2:15:14] things I can change, a way I can have a
[2:15:18] different approach and a positive
[2:15:20] approach. In other words, it's not, oh,
[2:15:22] this is a good story or this is a good
[2:15:25] sermon. Jesus Christ is the same
[2:15:27] yesterday, today, and forever. It
[2:15:29] becomes more to me. It becomes the coach
[2:15:32] of my life.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Now it's active.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; It's active in my determinations. It's
[2:15:44] active in my approach. It's active in my
[2:15:46] thinking. I'm taking this word. I'm
[2:15:49] telling you that sometimes we don't even
[2:15:53] bring this message to the great quality
[2:15:57] and ability and power and recognition
[2:16:00] that it deserves.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; It's become something that's gone by
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; instead of something that's calling us
[2:16:11] to go forward.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; This is the way to move forward.
[2:16:19] It's not what we ought to be. It's not
[2:16:22] what we should be. It's not what we
[2:16:24] were. But it's how do I go forward,
[2:16:27] Lord? How do I go forward? How about He
[2:16:30] just preaches a message called thinking
[2:16:32] men's filter.
[2:16:36] What is that? That's a coaching lesson.
[2:16:40] A life coach would sit down to you and
[2:16:42] say, "Now, the first thing you got to do
[2:16:44] is filter out
[2:16:47] all these other things.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Get rid of the static.
[2:16:56] I got I can listen to one tape for free
[2:16:58] and get all that advice,
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; but if I'm not looking at the tape
[2:17:06] or the word of God as a life coach,
[2:17:13] I heard on the radio the other day, they
[2:17:15] said, "Oh, our psychics, only 90% of the
[2:17:19] people that apply for Our thing can be a
[2:17:25] psychic.
[2:17:27] California psychic. I thought if you
[2:17:30] were psychic at all, you wouldn't live
[2:17:31] in California cuz you'd know that
[2:17:34] thing's gone.
[2:17:42] But
[2:17:44] for just $20,
[2:17:47] you can have 20 minutes
[2:17:49] of a life coach. You know who one of the
[2:17:52] first life coaches was? Dear Abby,
[2:18:01] astrology,
[2:18:03] all these things
[2:18:07] totally unvindicated.
[2:18:10] one man's understanding, sharing one
[2:18:12] man's understanding with another man.
[2:18:15] And so you accept my understanding and
[2:18:18] the way I look at it and the way I take
[2:18:20] it. Oh, okay. I'll try that.
[2:18:24] And yet we have someone that sat right
[2:18:26] there and said, "If you filter it
[2:18:29] through God's word, a thinking man will
[2:18:33] filter things through God's word." In
[2:18:35] other words, look to God's word first.
[2:18:39] That's right.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Don't lean to your own understanding.
[2:18:43] Here's the life coach telling us, you
[2:18:46] want to move forward. You want to be
[2:18:48] successful. You want to get to the
[2:18:50] rapture. I am going to coach your life.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave you. I'm not
[2:18:57] going to forsake you, but I'll be with
[2:18:59] you even in you the end. I'll send you
[2:19:02] another life coach. And he shall lead
[2:19:05] you and guide you in all truth and
[2:19:07] righteousness. Another comforter.
[2:19:11] And I thought, "What are these life
[2:19:13] coaches? They're comforters.
[2:19:15] Oh, you can make it through.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; You can get through this.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; You've got the goods."
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; And they walk out of that life coach
[2:19:25] pumped.
[2:19:30] I'm going to do this.
[2:19:35] They're going to go sell more. They're
[2:19:36] going to go do this.
[2:19:38] And I thought, here we are
[2:19:41] trying to go forward
[2:19:44] and we've never really comprehended,
[2:19:47] forgive me if I'm wrong, maybe it's me,
[2:19:51] but we've never comprehended God gave us
[2:19:53] a life coach.
[2:19:57] And he put his lessons down,
[2:20:02] you know, he talked he talked about
[2:20:05] perseverance. He talk about a think a
[2:20:07] man's filter. He says you want to be
[2:20:09] successful. Don't be ashamed of him.
[2:20:15] Don't be ashamed. He preaches ashamed of
[2:20:18] him. And he talks all about how this
[2:20:20] person wasn't ashamed. That person
[2:20:22] wasn't ashamed. What's he doing? That
[2:20:24] isn't just talking about people that
[2:20:26] assume. He's giving us a life lesson,
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; a lesson to achieve
[2:20:34] what it is inside of us. Forgive this
[2:20:38] explanation and the way I'm going to say
[2:20:40] this, but the scripture said when they
[2:20:42] found a tree
[2:20:44] that was none, wasn't fruitful
[2:20:47] and the the guy wanted to cut it down,
[2:20:50] he said the husbandry,
[2:20:53] the gardener, the guy that wants to care
[2:20:56] for that tree,
[2:20:58] he wants to dig it up and dung it or
[2:21:01] fertilize it.
[2:21:04] And I thought, we've got the great
[2:21:06] husbandry
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; if we're not fruitful.
[2:21:11] He wants to give us fertilizer.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that in a negative or
[2:21:16] thing, but he's our life coach,
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; to put life into our roots,
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; to put life into our earth, to dig us
[2:21:25] up,
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; to loosen the soil around us, and and
[2:21:29] and to put the nutrients. And the
[2:21:32] prophet of God called it spiritual
[2:21:34] vitamins.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; But see, we we haven't perceived him
[2:21:42] as a life coach.
[2:21:44] We haven't perceived him as the goto
[2:21:48] source in every circumstance. When these
[2:21:52] people get discouraged, they get
[2:21:53] defeated, they run to their their uh uh
[2:21:58] their their life coach, their analyst.
[2:22:02] What's the word I'm looking into? The
[2:22:04] they their counselors, their therapists.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; How you doing today? Oh, the lady at
[2:22:12] work, you know, she done this. Well, how
[2:22:15] does that make you feel?
[2:22:18] Well, it makes me feel like I'm
[2:22:20] replaceable.
[2:22:21] Oh
[2:22:25] my goodness. We had a life coach that
[2:22:28] said, "Nobody can take your place."
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; But we don't look at him as a life
[2:22:37] coach. We don't look them at as somebody
[2:22:39] that's given them instruction. We look
[2:22:41] at the present and we look at the past.
[2:22:44] And we have somebody that's trying to
[2:22:47] take us forward and give us every secret
[2:22:51] of life, every little analysis, every
[2:22:54] little thing we can do. How to deal with
[2:22:56] our neighbor, how to deal with the guy
[2:22:58] at work, how to deal with that, how to
[2:23:00] deal with this, how to deal with the
[2:23:02] relationship, how to deal with what you
[2:23:04] see in the mirror.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; It's all there.
[2:23:10] I mean, he preached sermons like perfect
[2:23:12] strength and perfect weakness.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; What did he say? You don't have to be
[2:23:17] perfect.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; You don't have to trust in your ability.
[2:23:26] What a life coach lesson.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm a failure. I've got so many
[2:23:30] weaknesses. I can't walk out that door
[2:23:33] out here and preach to these people. You
[2:23:35] know, I've done this in my life and I'm
[2:23:37] that and all that. And my life coach
[2:23:40] sits there. He says, "My strength
[2:23:43] is made perfect in weakness.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Walk out. Trust them.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; I'll be there for you.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[2:23:55] I'll stand in between you and the people
[2:23:59] breaking the word of life to their
[2:24:02] heart."
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:05] My strength is made perfect in weakness.
[2:24:08] Perfect strength, imperfect weakness.
[2:24:13] The lower you are, the greater he is.
[2:24:16] Thank you, Lord. That's not just a
[2:24:18] theory. That's a life coach lesson.
[2:24:24] People pay thousands of dollars
[2:24:28] to have somebody
[2:24:30] tell them that.
[2:24:32] And I can do it with a press of a
[2:24:34] button.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; I can do it by opening a pamphlet.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; I can sit there and say, "I don't
[2:24:42] understand." And my life code says,
[2:24:45] "You'll never understand God."
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; I won't. No.
[2:24:55] He says, "I don't understand God. I just
[2:24:59] believe him."
[2:25:01] And I think, "Oh my goodness,
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; I've been trying to wrap my head around
[2:25:06] God."
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; And then the life coach tells me, "The
[2:25:14] kingdom of God is within you. That you
[2:25:17] can neither comprehend the beginning nor
[2:25:19] the end of it."
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "What's he coaching me to
[2:25:22] do?" Trust me,
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; I got your back.
[2:25:30] Everybody talks about I got your back,
[2:25:32] buddy. You run into the flames. I got
[2:25:35] your back.
[2:25:37] Well, why don't we just switch the role?
[2:25:41] You run in the flames and I'll get your
[2:25:43] back. Well, I don't trust you to get my
[2:25:45] back.
[2:25:47] He's got our back.
[2:25:51] Think of it. No, he's just not. He's
[2:25:53] just not giving you something
[2:25:57] to believe. He just didn't lay this out,
[2:26:01] preach all this, put it all on tape,
[2:26:05] right? Go to the Bible, do all the signs
[2:26:08] and wonders he did, and give it to you
[2:26:10] as a package to say, "Believe this.
[2:26:16] This message is not that weak.
[2:26:20] It's more than that.
[2:26:22] It's a road mapap. It's a stepbystep
[2:26:27] guidance of the Holy Spirit to coach
[2:26:31] your life to give you every little move,
[2:26:35] every little thing you can change
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; to to from
[2:26:40] learning to say good morning
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; to drop in on I love you every now and
[2:26:49] then.
[2:26:55] You know, little things.
[2:26:57] I heard a story one time. A couple was
[2:27:00] driving down the road and in their
[2:27:02] pickup truck and and and the lady over
[2:27:07] there saw a young couple sitting there
[2:27:09] and he was driving and she was sitting
[2:27:11] next to him and she said, "Oh, look,
[2:27:13] dear. We used to be like that." And he
[2:27:16] looked over and he says, "I'm sitting
[2:27:18] where I've always sat.
[2:27:24] You know, sometimes it's just
[2:27:26] buying ISAP.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; See, we're not at war with the people
[2:27:33] that don't believe this message.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; We're not condemning the people that
[2:27:40] don't believe this message.
[2:27:44] It doesn't do you any good. He said they
[2:27:47] they're they're they're ungerant tied
[2:27:50] seed. They got life.
[2:27:54] They lean to other things. But you don't
[2:27:57] lean to your understanding. When you
[2:27:59] judge and you criticize, that's your own
[2:28:02] understanding. You don't need to do
[2:28:04] that. It doesn't help you with your
[2:28:07] life.
[2:28:09] And so we got this beautiful life coach.
[2:28:12] He says he says you know recognizing
[2:28:17] the day and its message.
[2:28:20] Now if I would say to you recognize the
[2:28:23] day and its message everybody if I would
[2:28:26] say describe the message to me everybody
[2:28:30] would go back to the teachings of
[2:28:31] brother Brown. But in the message he's
[2:28:36] telling us it's not his message that's
[2:28:39] the flashing red lights. He says the
[2:28:41] world in its condition is a message to
[2:28:45] you.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; The very world is a message to you of
[2:28:52] where we are. What time it is that we
[2:28:56] should get ready. In other words, it's
[2:28:59] time for us to take on the life coach
[2:29:06] and start letting him make the changes
[2:29:09] in our approach, in our personality, in
[2:29:12] our nature, in our decision making.
[2:29:16] That's going to help us navigate. We
[2:29:19] want to go up the ladder. You can
[2:29:21] actually progress in your business by
[2:29:24] simply
[2:29:25] listening to the word of God and putting
[2:29:28] God first.
[2:29:31] I know a man that moved here just so he
[2:29:33] could take communion
[2:29:36] and he liked to starve to death,
[2:29:40] but he hung on to God's word
[2:29:43] and God gave him this job and this job
[2:29:46] and this job that you know now he don't
[2:29:48] do nothing.
[2:29:51] Got a good job.
[2:29:55] He does something but you know what I
[2:29:56] mean. I think most of the time he's in
[2:29:59] air condition.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's what God does.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; You've got a life coach right here. You
[2:30:09] know, he says, you know, recognizing the
[2:30:12] day in its message, re the flash, you
[2:30:16] recognizing, sit back. The life coach is
[2:30:18] telling us, look around, see where
[2:30:21] you're at, understand it, understand
[2:30:24] your position,
[2:30:26] your place.
[2:30:28] You were put here to see.
[2:30:31] You were put here to see it coming to
[2:30:34] pass.
[2:30:36] I don't wish for another day.
[2:30:40] I wish for the day that I'm in.
[2:30:43] And I have a coach,
[2:30:46] a life coach that's going to give me
[2:30:49] every little secret, every little way to
[2:30:53] change my approach, to change my
[2:30:55] attitude, to change my voice, to change
[2:30:57] my saying. It's all in there.
[2:31:01] It's in pages after pages. You can go
[2:31:04] through. It's in sometimes the first 10
[2:31:07] minutes of a sermon
[2:31:10] or the last little bit. He lays all
[2:31:13] these great secrets of life out. You
[2:31:16] know, convinced and concerned, the
[2:31:19] greatest battle that's ever fought.
[2:31:23] All those things are more than sermons
[2:31:27] to the believer.
[2:31:29] They're our life coach.
[2:31:32] God's coaching our life,
[2:31:35] trying to take us from the condition
[2:31:38] that we're in
[2:31:40] in our present state to a higher state.
[2:31:47] It's one thing to realize you're in a
[2:31:50] hole,
[2:31:53] and it's another thing to understand
[2:31:56] that God's going to give you the steps
[2:32:00] to get out of it.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Say you're sorry.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; Don't hold a grudge. If you got a
[2:32:10] against anybody, go make it right. If
[2:32:13] somebody draws a circle and puts you
[2:32:15] out, draw a bigger circle and put them
[2:32:18] in.
[2:32:22] You know, think it not strange,
[2:32:26] the fiery darts of the enemy.
[2:32:30] These are not just
[2:32:32] sermons. They're not something just to
[2:32:35] identify the present condition.
[2:32:38] They're things that are to give us and
[2:32:41] put in our mind because the right mental
[2:32:45] attitude towards emn promise of God will
[2:32:48] bring it to pass.
[2:32:50] The right approach
[2:32:53] is so important with God. The right
[2:32:56] atmosphere, all these things
[2:33:00] are are things that are there. And my my
[2:33:03] heart's desire this morning is that we
[2:33:07] don't lean to our own understanding.
[2:33:10] But we realize that we have a life
[2:33:14] coach.
[2:33:16] Can I give him another word? A
[2:33:18] comforter.
[2:33:22] One that'll lead us and guide us in all
[2:33:25] truth. We've got the Holy Spirit just
[2:33:28] like an anointing,
[2:33:30] like a sensation, like a feeling, like
[2:33:33] something. It's more than that. It's our
[2:33:36] guide.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; It's our leader. It's our life coach.
[2:33:40] It's we can come up to say, "How do I
[2:33:42] deal this? How do I get out of this rut
[2:33:45] I'm in or the funk that I'm in?" Or, "I
[2:33:48] just can't seem to overcome. I I I got a
[2:33:51] depression. I I can't get there." And
[2:33:53] and these people go there and they sit
[2:33:56] and they spend all this money and they
[2:33:58] get asked all these questions
[2:34:02] and that person doesn't want them to get
[2:34:04] better
[2:34:07] because the minute you get better,
[2:34:08] you're not come see me no more. So I'm
[2:34:11] going to give you just enough to keep
[2:34:13] you sick.
[2:34:17] I don't want that kind of life coach
[2:34:20] because it's given to me to overcome.
[2:34:27] And he preaches a message, the life
[2:34:30] coach does, how can I overcome?
[2:34:34] And I find out I actually have somebody
[2:34:38] something that was given to me that was
[2:34:41] more than just a message from a prophet.
[2:34:45] It was more than just an event that took
[2:34:48] place, the son of man. It was actually
[2:34:51] him
[2:34:54] coming and telling all his sheep
[2:34:58] and all his children, I will not leave
[2:35:01] you nor forsake you, but I'll be with
[2:35:05] you even in you till the end. And I will
[2:35:08] not leave you comfortless. I will come
[2:35:11] again and I will coach you
[2:35:16] in the ways of all righteousnesses. I
[2:35:18] will coach you and guide you
[2:35:23] so you can get through every adversity.
[2:35:28] Church, this message is more than I've
[2:35:31] ever dreamed it could be.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; It's everything
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; to us. Amen.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; He loves you. He'll not leave you. He
[2:35:44] will not forsake you. But he promised he
[2:35:48] would coach you even till the end. God
[2:35:53] bless you. Let's stand this morning.
[2:35:56] [Applause]
[2:36:02] Oh, we need a coach, don't we?
[2:36:12] You know, I always admired
[2:36:15] professional athletes, tennis players,
[2:36:18] golfers, baseball players, and come to
[2:36:22] find out, every single one of them's got
[2:36:24] a personal coach. They got coaches.
[2:36:27] Some teams have 30 coaches
[2:36:32] to find every little thing. I've got one
[2:36:35] coach.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:36:41] Christ
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; guiding me in his word and he'll get us
[2:36:45] all the way through. Let's bow our heads
[2:36:47] this morning.
[2:36:53] Maybe you'd like just to turn your heart
[2:36:55] to him this morning
[2:37:00] and say, "Lord, I'm in places that
[2:37:05] I really don't want to be, and
[2:37:10] I need you to coach me
[2:37:14] further down the road.
[2:37:22] When a person has a life coach or a
[2:37:24] therapist,
[2:37:26] they set time aside and they make an
[2:37:28] appointment
[2:37:31] and they go in and they sit down and
[2:37:34] they talk all their troubles,
[2:37:37] all their fears, all their doubts, and
[2:37:40] they talk it over.
[2:37:42] [Music]
[2:37:44] And Lord, that's just one man to another
[2:37:47] man or one woman to another woman or
[2:37:50] vice versa, whatever it is.
[2:37:54] And they're getting one man's opinion.
[2:37:58] But Lord, I can come and sit on your
[2:38:02] couch
[2:38:08] and you'll tell me things that
[2:38:11] nobody else knows.
[2:38:15] You'll speak to my heart and tell me
[2:38:18] what I should do or what I should stop
[2:38:21] doing.
[2:38:26] And Lord, it's a free session
[2:38:31] and your door is always open
[2:38:34] anytime,
[2:38:36] any place, anywhere.
[2:38:41] And Lord, I've not
[2:38:45] entered into that relationship with you
[2:38:47] like I should
[2:38:50] of you being my coach and my counselor,
[2:38:56] my guide.
[2:38:58] And this morning, I'd like to lift my
[2:39:00] hand to you and say, Lord, I'd like to
[2:39:04] start
[2:39:07] a closer relationship with you, Father.
[2:39:10] One more of you leading me and guiding
[2:39:14] me in the steps of life,
[2:39:18] instructing me in all truth and
[2:39:22] righteousness.
[2:39:23] [Music]
[2:39:26] Father,
[2:39:30] casting my cares upon you because you
[2:39:34] care for me,
[2:39:37] Lord. This message is more than just the
[2:39:39] truth of all the doctrines.
[2:39:44] It's more than the fulfillment of every
[2:39:47] promise in every scripture.
[2:39:51] It's you personally
[2:39:54] guiding each one of your children.
[2:39:58] Like a father and mother raises her
[2:40:00] child.
[2:40:02] Father, you raise us up.
[2:40:05] And father, I feel maybe in my heart
[2:40:09] [Music]
[2:40:12] that I I have left that part out
[2:40:16] of my life.
[2:40:20] I left that part out of this message
[2:40:24] that it's more than law. It's more than
[2:40:27] what's right and wrong.
[2:40:30] It's full of secrets of my success.
[2:40:34] It's full of secrets of my peace.
[2:40:39] It gives me a heavenly understanding.
[2:40:43] It molds my nature
[2:40:48] that we can be like you.
[2:40:51] It guides my footsteps.
[2:40:55] And as you spoke, Father,
[2:40:59] and you said in in this great scripture
[2:41:02] reading
[2:41:04] that we read,
[2:41:11] you said, "Acknowledge the Lord
[2:41:16] in all thy ways.
[2:41:21] Trust in the Lord
[2:41:24] with all thine heart,
[2:41:26] and lean not
[2:41:29] unto thine own understanding.
[2:41:32] In all ways acknowledge him, and he
[2:41:36] shall direct thy path.
[2:41:41] Father, I want to invite you today to be
[2:41:43] the director of my path.
[2:41:46] If you'd like and you feel that in your
[2:41:48] heart this morning, you'd like just to
[2:41:50] lift your hand to him. Say, "Lord, I'd
[2:41:53] like you to be more of a director of my
[2:41:55] path."
[2:41:57] Lord, I'm inviting in coming to your
[2:42:00] office this morning.
[2:42:02] asking that you would be my life coach,
[2:42:06] that you would speak to me from your
[2:42:08] word and bring to me the truths that
[2:42:12] would make me a a a a more loving
[2:42:16] person,
[2:42:17] a kinder and gentler person
[2:42:20] that the fruits of your spirit may show
[2:42:23] forth in my life. Lord, we place our
[2:42:26] hands up those that have have their
[2:42:28] hands raised.
[2:42:30] Father,
[2:42:32] most people are fine.
[2:42:36] They don't need you that much, but
[2:42:38] Father, I do.
[2:42:41] And I'm asking you to grant it to those
[2:42:43] that have put their heart to you this
[2:42:46] morning, Lord, that you would become,
[2:42:50] Father, the director of their path. That
[2:42:54] you would lead them and guide them in
[2:42:56] all truth and righteousness. We ask it
[2:43:00] in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2:43:04] Amen.
[2:43:06] Oh holy
[2:43:07] word,
[2:43:10] long preserved
[2:43:13] for our walk
[2:43:16] in this world.
[2:43:19] They resound
[2:43:21] with God's own heart.
[2:43:24] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[2:43:29] [Music]
[2:43:30] Words of life,
[2:43:33] words of hope.
[2:43:36] Give us strength.
[2:43:39] Help us win.
[2:43:42] In this world
[2:43:45] where we roam,
[2:43:48] the word of God will guide us home.
[2:43:54] The word of God
[2:43:58] ever true,
[2:44:00] changing me
[2:44:03] and changing you. Oh, we have

[2:44:28] to this day
[2:44:31] to us
[2:44:33] through sacrifice.
[2:44:36] Holy, the faithful word of Christ,
[2:44:42] the holy word
[2:44:45] [Music]
[2:44:47] reserve
[2:44:49] for our
[2:44:52] in
[2:44:59] heart.

[2:45:16] and changing you.
[2:45:19] We have found
[2:45:22] with heart eyes.
[2:45:25] Oh, let the word of God.
[2:45:32] Word of God
[2:45:34] has been
[2:45:37] the shield
[2:45:40] has been revealed.
[2:45:43] is now the word
[2:45:46] and word alone.
[2:45:49] Our Christ is here to take
[2:45:53] us.
[2:45:55] Word of God,
[2:45:58] [Music]
[2:46:01] changing me
[2:46:04] and changing you.
[2:46:08] We have done
[2:46:10] with open hearts.
[2:46:13] Oh, let the word of God.

[3:04:13] Hallelujah. Trust we all enjoy that.
[3:04:16] We'll invite brother Andrew at this time
[3:04:17] to close our service in a word of
[3:04:19] prayer.
[3:04:33] It was good to be in the house of the
[3:04:34] Lord today.
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; I'm just rejoicing in the realities of
[3:04:39] what our pastor speaking. And it just
[3:04:42] what a privileged people we are to know
[3:04:43] that we have a guide. Just a great
[3:04:46] reminder of that great life that God has
[3:04:49] inside of us all that he wants to have
[3:04:51] that grand fellowship. And let us bow
[3:04:54] our heads together. Father, we thank you
[3:04:57] for the the promise of your presence,
[3:05:00] Lord, to Lord, renew our mind and to
[3:05:04] help us to understand that
[3:05:07] the way we perceive it is not reality.
[3:05:09] But your word, Lord, it gives us life.
[3:05:11] And so we're thankful, Lord, that not
[3:05:15] only did you reveal, Lord God, that
[3:05:17] there's life after death, but Lord,
[3:05:19] you're the God of life and the God of
[3:05:21] resurrection. So, oh God, we thank you
[3:05:24] that when we look back or look around,
[3:05:26] Lord, that's not where our vision is,
[3:05:28] Lord. But we look to the fulfillment,
[3:05:31] Lord, of your promise in our lives. And
[3:05:33] so, Father, Lord, we just want to
[3:05:35] surrender ourselves more and more, Lord,
[3:05:37] and to this great reality, Lord, and to
[3:05:40] go to the storehouse and let you lead
[3:05:42] us, Lord, to be that life coach, Lord.
[3:05:45] Father, we ask your mercy and grace upon
[3:05:48] this people as we go, Lord. Lord, it was
[3:05:51] good, Lord, to hear once again the the
[3:05:55] words of life and how it makes such a
[3:05:57] difference. We pray you bless our pastor
[3:05:59] and we pray you'd strengthen him and
[3:06:02] continue to pour out your grace and the
[3:06:04] abundant revelation, Lord, that we can
[3:06:06] grow in grace and we can grow with one
[3:06:09] another, Lord, and to see the way you
[3:06:11] see it, Father. So as we go about our
[3:06:14] different ways, Lord, we pray you'd
[3:06:16] bring us back together that we can, oh
[3:06:18] God, come with an expectation, Lord,
[3:06:20] that you have a double portion for us
[3:06:22] today. Lord, we ask your blessings upon
[3:06:25] your people as they go and we go rejoice
[3:06:28] and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name.
[3:06:31] Amen.
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are dismissed. Let's
[3:06:38] sing. I've never been sorry since I
[3:06:40] trusted his name.
[3:06:48] Ever since Jesus saved and pardoned,
[3:06:51] I've been singing every day. I've never
[3:06:54] been sorry
[3:06:56] that I trusted his name.
[3:07:00] And through the dark shadows, he is with
[3:07:02] me, guiding me on this earth way. I've
[3:07:06] never been sorry
[3:07:09] that I trust in his name.
[3:07:11] Oh, I've never been sorry
[3:07:15] that I trust in his name.
[3:07:18] Oh, every moment I find
[3:07:21] he's exactly the same.
[3:07:24] Oh, my soul has been saved
[3:07:27] since the Savior came.
[3:07:30] Oh, I've never been sorry
[3:07:33] that I trusted his name.
[3:07:36] Oh, all long I sore.
[3:07:40] Praising him for my Christmas. I've
[3:07:43] never been sorry.
[3:07:46] And I trusted his name.
[3:07:49] And surely I know my way
[3:07:53] in heaven. I've never been sorry.
[3:07:58] I trust in his name.
[3:08:01] Oh, I've never been sorry.
[3:08:04] that I trust in his name.
[3:08:07] Oh, every moment I find him, he's
[3:08:11] exactly the same.
[3:08:13] Oh, my soul has been singing
[3:08:17] since the Savior came.
[3:08:20] Oh, I've never been sorry
[3:08:23] that I trusted his name.
[3:08:26] I am probably the star of all the sun.
[3:08:30] Maybe my mind went brighter. I've never
[3:08:33] been sorry
[3:08:35] that I trusted his name.
[3:08:39] Oh, never thought of sacrifice. Jesus is
[3:08:43] with me.
[3:08:45] I've never been sorry
[3:08:48] that I trusted his name.
[3:08:51] I've never been sorry
[3:08:54] that I trust in his name.
[3:08:57] Oh, every moment I find him, he's
[3:09:01] exactly the same.
[3:09:03] Oh, my soul has been singing
[3:09:07] since the Savior came.
[3:09:10] Oh, I've never been sorry
[3:09:13] that I trust in his name.
