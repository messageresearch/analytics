[18:28] they told him about a mandate father
[18:32] he didn't know that that man was him
[18:36] what a judgment father
[18:38] he said
[18:40] such a man
[18:42] is to die
[18:44] all father but when they told him
[18:47] that man it's you
[18:50] father he cry
[18:53] that's how we are father
[18:55] this morning we just feel ourself as
[18:58] david father
[19:00] we are able father
[19:01] [Music]
[19:03] to pronounce judgment
[19:07] different things for other
[19:09] without looking ourself in the mirror
[19:12] father
[19:14] but father we don't wanna be so this
[19:16] morning

[22:02] [Music]
[22:04] amen
[22:05] amen
[22:07] amen it's good to be gathered in the
[22:08] presence of the lord we want to welcome
[22:10] everyone and then all our visitors we
[22:12] welcome you this morning and then all
[22:14] that are viewing online we welcome you
[22:16] this morning it's invited by the mike
[22:18] for so i'm reading god bless you
[22:35] good morning
[22:37] we're going to do this
[22:39] little old fashioned again this morning
[22:41] don't have someone back there to work
[22:42] the verses so we'll just read it in our
[22:44] bibles this morning
[22:46] you know psalm
[22:48] 84
[22:50] and verse 1
[22:52] says this
[22:54] how amiable
[22:56] are thy tabernacles oh lord of hosts
[23:02] what struck me about that verse
[23:05] is is that statement thy tabernacles
[23:10] not tabernacle singular
[23:14] but thy tabernacles
[23:16] plural
[23:19] how amiable are thy tabernacles
[23:22] plural
[23:25] then it says in verse 4
[23:28] it says blessed are they
[23:30] that dwell in thy house
[23:34] so one house
[23:36] but many tabernacles
[23:40] many courts
[23:41] verse 2
[23:43] verse 10
[23:45] but one house
[23:47] verse
[23:48] 11. know and as i was
[23:52] meditating over that you know obviously
[23:54] the scripture came to mind where jesus
[23:57] was telling his disciples in john 14
[24:01] in my father's house are many mansions
[24:06] he goes on to say i go to prepare a
[24:08] place for you
[24:10] that where i am
[24:12] present tense
[24:14] there ye may be also
[24:19] many tabernacles
[24:21] many mansions
[24:25] many courts
[24:27] one house
[24:30] you know a house or a tabernacle or a
[24:33] mansion
[24:34] is a dwelling place
[24:37] you know when the children of israel
[24:38] were first led out of the
[24:41] land of egypt
[24:43] you know they experienced a change of
[24:45] dwelling place
[24:48] you know when they first
[24:50] were living in egypt
[24:52] they had houses
[24:54] in the best part of the land
[24:57] goshen
[24:59] you know but that those houses became a
[25:01] place of death for them
[25:04] if they didn't have blood
[25:06] applied to those houses
[25:10] and you know it was after that one night
[25:13] with the bloody lamb that became the
[25:14] last night they ever dwelt in those
[25:16] houses
[25:17] from that point in time their dwelling
[25:20] place changed and they never dwelt in
[25:22] those houses again
[25:24] they moved from
[25:26] their houses
[25:28] to his tabernacles
[25:31] it says in leviticus 23
[25:34] 42 it says ye shall dwell in booths
[25:37] seven days
[25:39] all that are israelites born shall dwell
[25:42] in booths
[25:43] that your generations may know
[25:46] that i made the children of israel to
[25:47] dwell in booths
[25:49] when i brought them out of the land of
[25:51] egypt
[25:53] i am the lord your
[25:54] god it says in verse 34 that that time
[25:57] of remembrance that he's speaking of is
[25:59] called the feast of the tabernacles
[26:03] it was a reminder to them that god had
[26:05] changed their dwelling place
[26:09] that they went from dwelling in houses
[26:11] to dwelling in booths
[26:14] tabernacles
[26:15] temporary dwelling places
[26:20] and interestingly enough those temporary
[26:22] dwelling places were in the presence of
[26:24] the pillar of fire
[26:28] says in psalm 84 10
[26:31] for a day and thy courts is better than
[26:34] a thousand
[26:35] i had rather be a doorkeeper in the
[26:38] house of my god
[26:40] than to dwell
[26:41] in the tents of wickedness
[26:45] now how how many are grateful that they
[26:47] experienced a change in dwelling place
[26:50] amen you know there might have been a
[26:53] time when we lived comfortably
[26:55] in egypt
[26:57] but then after a night with a bloody
[26:59] lamb
[27:01] we found ourselves in a temporary
[27:04] dwelling place dwelling
[27:07] with the pillar of fire that where i am
[27:11] their ye may be also
[27:14] you know tabernacles are a temporary
[27:16] dwelling place in fact they're usually
[27:17] made of
[27:18] skin interestingly enough
[27:22] you know for the children of israel
[27:24] there was that whole period of time
[27:26] where they had a temporary journey
[27:28] living in temporary tabernacles of skin
[27:32] you know as we read in john 14
[27:36] it says there's a place prepared for
[27:38] each of us
[27:39] a mansion
[27:41] a tabernacle a house a booth whatever
[27:44] you want to call it but a dwelling place
[27:47] where he is there
[27:49] we may be awesome
[27:52] you know there's all kinds of uh
[27:54] there's all kinds of lifestyle magazines
[27:56] that might flood our mailboxes
[27:59] you know you've got country living
[28:02] you've got
[28:03] southern living
[28:05] you've got coastal living
[28:08] apparently there's a south lake living
[28:10] it comes to my mailbox and i don't even
[28:12] live in south lake
[28:14] all of them these lifestyle
[28:16] magazines that speak of a lifestyle
[28:20] this lifestyle is tabernacle living
[28:24] you know and as we read
[28:26] psalm 84 this morning which by the way
[28:28] was once again addressed to the sons of
[28:31] korah
[28:33] people that knew what redemption was
[28:37] you know this talks a little bit about
[28:38] tabernacle living
[28:41] it's so important that we don't write
[28:43] that off as a future dwelling place
[28:48] you know as we read
[28:50] this issue of tabernacle living
[28:54] notice what kind of lifestyle this is
[28:58] it says in verse 2 my soul longeth yea
[29:01] even fainteth for the courts of the lord
[29:04] my heart
[29:06] and my flesh
[29:08] cry out for the living god
[29:11] i think about that
[29:14] my very flesh cries out for the living
[29:17] god
[29:20] you know we know that we battle our
[29:21] flesh daily that would constantly pull
[29:23] us back
[29:24] to egypt
[29:25] but with tabernacle living there's a
[29:27] submission of that flesh
[29:30] so that it cries out
[29:32] for his tabernacles
[29:34] tabernacle living
[29:37] in verse 4 blessed are they that dwell
[29:39] in thy house they will be still praising
[29:43] thee
[29:44] continuous
[29:46] praise
[29:47] no matter when you look in this house
[29:50] those who dwell there are a constant
[29:52] praise to the lord
[29:55] verse 5 blessed is the man whose
[29:57] strength is in thee in whose heart
[30:00] are the ways of them
[30:02] i like the way that the new king james
[30:04] says it whose heart is set on a
[30:07] pilgrimage
[30:10] the new american standard says in whose
[30:13] heart are the highways of zion
[30:16] that's pretty good
[30:18] the lifestyle of tabernacle living
[30:23] verse six i like this one who passing
[30:25] through the valley of bacca
[30:28] make it a well
[30:30] you know that valley of bacca isn't
[30:32] mentioned anywhere else in scripture
[30:35] and it actually means in the hebrew the
[30:37] valley of sorrow
[30:39] or the valley of weeping
[30:42] no tabernacle living isn't that you
[30:44] won't go through the valley of sorrow
[30:48] but that even when you're there
[30:51] can be found a stream of living water
[30:54] those who passing through the valley of
[30:56] bacon make it a well
[30:59] tabernacle
[31:01] living
[31:03] verse 7 every one of them in zion
[31:06] appeareth
[31:07] before god
[31:09] while you might read casually about
[31:11] those that seek god in southern living
[31:14] in tabernacle living you have a place in
[31:16] his presence
[31:20] in verse 11 the lord will give grace and
[31:22] glory
[31:24] no good thing will he withhold
[31:27] from them that walk uprightly
[31:30] you know i think i agree with verse 10
[31:33] i had rather be a doorkeeper
[31:36] in tabernacle living
[31:39] than to dwell in everything that country
[31:41] living and southern living and luxury
[31:43] living and coastal living might offer
[31:47] so as we read this together
[31:50] this magazine that describes the
[31:52] lifestyle of tabernacle living
[31:54] you know i hope that you can put
[31:56] yourself in the scripture
[31:58] that where i am there ye may be also
[32:02] let's read psalm 84 together starting in
[32:05] verse 1 how amiable are thy tabernacles
[32:09] o lord of hosts
[32:10] my soul longeth yea even fainteth for
[32:13] the courts of the lord my heart and my
[32:16] flesh crieth out for the living god
[32:19] yea the sparrow hath found in house and
[32:21] the swallow a nest for herself where she
[32:24] may lay her young even thine altars o
[32:27] lord of hosts my king and my god
[32:30] blessed are they that dwell in thy house
[32:33] they will be still praising thee selah
[32:36] blessed is the man whose strength is in
[32:39] thee in whose heart are the ways of them
[32:42] who passing through the valley of bacca
[32:44] make it a well the rain also fillet the
[32:47] pools they go from strength to strength
[32:50] every one of them in zion appeareth
[32:52] before god
[32:54] oh lord god of hosts hear my prayer give
[32:57] ear o god of jacob selah behold o god
[33:01] our shield and look upon the face of
[33:03] thine anointed for a day and thy courts
[33:06] is better than a thousand i had rather
[33:09] be a doorkeeper in the house of my god
[33:11] than to dwell in the tents of wickedness
[33:14] for the lord god is a sun and shield the
[33:17] lord will give grace and glory no good
[33:20] thing will he withhold from them that
[33:22] walk uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed
[33:25] is the man that trusteth in thee
[33:31] amen god bless you i have your seats

[58:13] patrick dan's
[58:16] daughter

[58:22] would get ready
[58:23] and
[58:24] prepare to come
[58:26] at this time
[58:28] and
[58:29] it's found in romans chapter
[58:32] 12 and the 12th
[58:34] verse and as you know patrick will give
[58:38] a little testimony but
[58:41] they had a very difficult
[58:47] pregnancy and
[58:49] a child birth very premature
[58:52] and patrick said this is the scripture
[58:54] that they held on to
[58:56] so as they're getting ready to come it
[58:58] says rejoice in hope
[59:00] patient and tribulation
[59:03] continually instant
[59:05] in prayer
[59:06] and they just hung on that so let's just
[59:09] sing uh
[59:10] bring them in this morning
[59:12] do you help me billy saying that um
[59:28] jesus
[59:38] bring the little ones to jesus
[59:54] you know it it's a miracle that
[59:57] someone could produce you know like this
[1:00:00] can produce something so beautiful as
[1:00:02] this
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] amen you know i love patrick's testimony
[1:00:11] i i like to give it because
[1:00:15] you know
[1:00:16] brother patrick was working on a job
[1:00:18] somewhere
[1:00:19] and he just never could sleep and he was
[1:00:22] tormented and
[1:00:23] and he just felt demons were just
[1:00:25] driving him crazy
[1:00:27] so he made a comment to the fellow
[1:00:29] standing next to him he says you may not
[1:00:32] see me tomorrow i think i'll just go
[1:00:34] kill myself
[1:00:36] and the guy said wait a minute before
[1:00:38] you do diet go talk to these people well
[1:00:41] he was a brother that used to go to
[1:00:43] church and backslidden went out in the
[1:00:45] world
[1:00:46] but it just tells you once you got this
[1:00:48] you can't get away from him
[1:00:51] and so patrick came over billy was it
[1:00:53] you that brought him over and billy
[1:00:54] brought him over and we sat in the couch
[1:00:56] that day and we talked to him we prayed
[1:00:58] for him
[1:00:59] and uh and uh
[1:01:01] so
[1:01:02] he said i i said now you you'll sleep
[1:01:05] and i said we prayed we asked that demon
[1:01:07] to leave them
[1:01:08] and uh i said billy just give him a tape
[1:01:12] or a book and belly gave him demonology
[1:01:14] you know so
[1:01:16] and uh so then one day i see patrick
[1:01:20] he's coming across the parking lot and
[1:01:22] of course i want to know if he's been
[1:01:24] sleeping right so i said patrick you're
[1:01:27] going to see me says oh no i can't sleep
[1:01:29] i just can't sleep i listen to these
[1:01:31] tapes all night long he said i just
[1:01:33] cannot keep leasing and doing so i you
[1:01:36] know this is uh he's always been a great
[1:01:39] friend of mine
[1:01:40] and and
[1:01:41] this is one of the real genuine
[1:01:44] conversions that i've seen you know what
[1:01:48] i mean brother tommy's another genuine
[1:01:50] conversion i've seen that i've really
[1:01:53] seen god supernaturally
[1:01:55] do some wonderful things so patrick i
[1:01:58] know you want to say a few things about
[1:02:00] your daughter in the journey you've been
[1:02:02] on
[1:02:07] god bless you
[1:02:10] i
[1:02:10] thank you all for your prayers
[1:02:14] we went to many trials in this
[1:02:18] because my wife all the time was going
[1:02:21] to
[1:02:22] like when she gets pregnancy she going
[1:02:24] to miscarrying all the time
[1:02:27] like twice
[1:02:28] and this is the third one and
[1:02:32] i remember that day
[1:02:34] at the hospital when we came when she
[1:02:37] was witness for this baby
[1:02:40] the doctor said oh this is going to
[1:02:42] happen the same thing you know we don't
[1:02:44] understand how this comes but
[1:02:47] we have to check everything and see
[1:02:50] and my wife was saying okay or we thank
[1:02:53] for that but let's go home my wife told
[1:02:55] me let's go home we just have to go and
[1:02:57] pray
[1:02:58] and after some days my wife started
[1:03:01] waring about
[1:03:03] what's going on why this happened
[1:03:05] and
[1:03:06] one scripture come to me
[1:03:09] one court of brother branham
[1:03:11] in the resurrection of jesus
[1:03:15] found in 56 or 405
[1:03:20] i read for my wife because she was
[1:03:22] wearing some time or what is coming to
[1:03:24] me
[1:03:25] it said this
[1:03:26] god don't want you to be
[1:03:29] frowning
[1:03:30] god wants you to be happy
[1:03:34] the human heart was
[1:03:36] made to be happy
[1:03:38] where it will cause cancer
[1:03:41] temper will cause cancer
[1:03:43] don't never be upset
[1:03:46] just walk in love
[1:03:49] and after that
[1:03:50] my wife never complained about anything
[1:03:53] and
[1:03:54] after that we went to hospital oh we
[1:03:56] look everything is fine now and it's
[1:03:59] going to be okay and after that
[1:04:01] here she is and we really thank the lord
[1:04:04] for that
[1:04:12] isn't that just the devil he al that's
[1:04:14] just one of his tricks you know all

[1:06:43] lord
[1:06:44] and to
[1:06:46] fellowship around with the word of the
[1:06:47] lord we're going to continue
[1:06:51] this morning
[1:06:52] on
[1:06:56] preaching from the message does god
[1:07:01] change his mind about his word
[1:07:04] and we're going to build a little bit on
[1:07:07] what that we
[1:07:10] spoke on wednesday night i just really
[1:07:12] enjoyed wednesday night and the
[1:07:14] fellowship with the people
[1:07:16] and
[1:07:17] wait a minute i know that there's
[1:07:18] somebody here somewhere
[1:07:21] oh there he is is that justin there
[1:07:25] it is is that his lovely wife
[1:07:28] stand up i got to see you guys
[1:07:33] hey man
[1:07:38] i i i think i picked justin up at the
[1:07:42] bus station when he was about as high to
[1:07:45] my knee
[1:07:47] and just and he's just grown up and got
[1:07:49] married now that's wonderful to have you
[1:07:52] sister genie glad to have him home with
[1:07:54] you a little bit
[1:07:56] amen so that's so
[1:07:58] wonderful hallelujah
[1:08:01] so we're
[1:08:02] we're talking down this line does god
[1:08:06] change his mind about his work
[1:08:08] and and we try to go through some
[1:08:10] emphasis on
[1:08:13] wednesday night
[1:08:14] about the word that god
[1:08:17] is
[1:08:18] uh not changing
[1:08:21] isn't
[1:08:22] this
[1:08:23] book
[1:08:24] as a
[1:08:28] put together
[1:08:29] sermons and
[1:08:31] edifications and prophecies and writings
[1:08:35] as god moved on the prophets of old and
[1:08:38] they they gathered these works together
[1:08:41] i believe by the leadership of the holy
[1:08:44] spirit
[1:08:45] and they put them together in a book
[1:08:47] that became known as the bible
[1:08:51] and and you could go back in the history
[1:08:54] of the church and how they hand wrote
[1:08:56] these and
[1:08:57] and then king james
[1:08:59] organized and brought it together and
[1:09:02] and they produced the king james
[1:09:05] bible and what they found it was that
[1:09:09] there was perfect continuity from all
[1:09:12] the writings of all the things
[1:09:14] everything that god wrote by his spirit
[1:09:17] fit
[1:09:19] and it
[1:09:20] fitted and joined together perfectly
[1:09:23] but
[1:09:24] there was some books that were written
[1:09:26] along the way that didn't match up
[1:09:29] and by the grace of god they were
[1:09:31] discarded from the word and we remained
[1:09:34] with this
[1:09:35] uh this
[1:09:37] book here that we call the bible
[1:09:40] but there's a great mystery in this book
[1:09:42] because the lord said the letter killeth
[1:09:45] but the spirit giveth life
[1:09:48] so by the same book some people die
[1:09:51] and by the same book some people live
[1:09:54] and so the great the great uh
[1:09:58] understanding is is that it wasn't what
[1:10:01] god collected that didn't change it was
[1:10:05] what god thought in the beginning that
[1:10:08] didn't change
[1:10:09] and then we begin to talk about how that
[1:10:12] you were in that thought
[1:10:14] so this morning we want to just continue
[1:10:18] down that road
[1:10:20] because i believe that we're coming into
[1:10:22] something that's wonderful for the
[1:10:24] church
[1:10:25] i believe he's got something in store
[1:10:28] for us he's got something
[1:10:30] that is
[1:10:31] marvelous for us to behold
[1:10:34] but that he's got to guide us there
[1:10:37] and so
[1:10:38] this message was on my heart to play
[1:10:43] last wednesday night and and then the
[1:10:45] lord moved on me to to go ahead and
[1:10:47] speak
[1:10:48] but
[1:10:49] it i found out after the fact that this
[1:10:53] was also the message that the brothers
[1:10:56] chose to
[1:10:57] fellowship around
[1:11:00] the morning and our brother's breakfast
[1:11:03] and i really encourage you
[1:11:05] to find out when the brothers breakfast
[1:11:08] is and
[1:11:09] and your brothers that can come out make
[1:11:11] the special effort it's some really
[1:11:14] marvelous fellowship around the word of
[1:11:16] god
[1:11:17] so we're going to play 20 minutes this
[1:11:20] morning
[1:11:22] of the message the guide
[1:11:24] and when brother brown goes to read the
[1:11:26] scriptures you can stand up and read at
[1:11:29] that time
[1:11:30] but what we talked about wednesday night
[1:11:32] was that
[1:11:33] that if god thought it he's the keeper
[1:11:37] of his thoughts
[1:11:38] he's the keeper
[1:11:40] and and and so he keeps his sheep
[1:11:44] so he knows what he's doing and he's
[1:11:47] keeping you so this i just thought this
[1:11:49] was a marvelous message it's preached in
[1:11:52] i believe 19 and six is a 62 is when was
[1:11:56] it preached i think it was 62
[1:11:58] and i think it's a great foreknowledge
[1:12:01] of the things that's uh coming forth so
[1:12:04] just sit back for the next 20 minutes
[1:12:06] and we'll make a few comments this
[1:12:08] morning and fellowship around the word
[1:12:11] of god but listen to
[1:12:13] the scripture
[1:12:15] and then listen to the description
[1:12:18] of what a guide is
[1:12:20] and then each of us
[1:12:23] i hope this morning comes to realize
[1:12:27] that we have
[1:12:28] our own
[1:12:30] personal
[1:12:31] guide
[1:12:32] and we'll fellowship a little bit about
[1:12:34] that afterwards so uh
[1:12:37] uh if you go ahead and place this uh
[1:12:40] scripture up there
[1:12:41] in it where we're gonna start from and
[1:12:44] it says we're gonna read it it's out of
[1:12:47] uh saint john
[1:12:50] and
[1:12:51] i don't really see the verse number here
[1:12:53] but
[1:12:54] anyway we can look at that when it comes
[1:12:56] on the board so let's stand together and
[1:12:59] pray as we listen to the and when the
[1:13:01] scripture says i think is
[1:13:05] the seventh
[1:13:06] verse of the 16th chapter
[1:13:09] of
[1:13:10] saint john
[1:13:12] let's pray our gracious heavenly father
[1:13:16] we ask you to bless this word to us this
[1:13:18] morning
[1:13:19] father we're here because
[1:13:22] we want to
[1:13:23] know of you
[1:13:24] father we're here because we have a
[1:13:26] promise that if we would gather together
[1:13:29] in your name that you would be in our
[1:13:31] midst
[1:13:32] father we have another promise that you
[1:13:35] know what we have need of even before we
[1:13:37] ask
[1:13:38] father and you promised us that we
[1:13:41] wouldn't have to bake bread
[1:13:43] and we're not worried about the bread of
[1:13:45] the world father we're worried about the
[1:13:48] bread of life
[1:13:49] this morning and father we ask that you
[1:13:51] would break to us the bread of life that
[1:13:54] you would feed our souls and our spirits
[1:13:56] if we're down-hearted father we ask that
[1:13:59] you lift us up
[1:14:00] if we have fear father of our destiny we
[1:14:04] ask that you would comfort us

[1:14:23] with us in jesus name we pray
[1:14:26] amen god bless you this morning
[1:14:30] now
[1:14:32] i wish to read tonight a potion of
[1:14:34] scripture found over uh in the book of
[1:14:37] saint john
[1:14:39] now
[1:14:40] these little uh scriptures that we read
[1:14:43] and refer to are to give us a basic for
[1:14:47] what we're trying to say
[1:14:49] and always i have never one time as i
[1:14:52] ever remember of ever coming to the
[1:14:54] pulpit to try to just say something to
[1:14:57] be singer
[1:14:59] i always try to
[1:15:01] wait
[1:15:02] watch study pray until i feel that i
[1:15:05] have something that would help the
[1:15:07] people
[1:15:09] if i can't be a help there's nothing to
[1:15:11] be standing here and see is try to help
[1:15:14] and now tonight
[1:15:15] uh of course the bigger part of our
[1:15:17] crowd is moved out from this morning and
[1:15:20] uh they had to go home many of them but
[1:15:24] tonight i told you if you stayed over
[1:15:26] we're trying to have just about a
[1:15:27] 45-minute talk on something that i hope
[1:15:30] would help us and we're going to base
[1:15:32] this now on saint john the 16th chapter
[1:15:36] and let's begin about the um
[1:15:39] the seventh verse
[1:15:41] of the 16th chapter and read to the the
[1:15:43] 15th verse
[1:15:47] nevertheless i tell you the truth it is
[1:15:50] expedient for you
[1:15:52] that i go away
[1:15:54] for if i go not away the comforter will
[1:15:57] not come unto you
[1:15:59] but if i depart i will send him unto you
[1:16:03] and when he is come he will reprove the
[1:16:06] world of sin
[1:16:08] and of righteousness and of judgment
[1:16:12] of sin because they believe not on me
[1:16:16] of righteousness because i go to my
[1:16:18] father and you see me no more
[1:16:21] of judgment because the prince of this
[1:16:23] world
[1:16:24] is judged
[1:16:26] i have yet many things to say unto you
[1:16:29] but you cannot bear them now
[1:16:33] how big
[1:16:34] when he
[1:16:36] the spirit of truth is come
[1:16:38] he will guide you into all truth
[1:16:42] for he shall not speak of himself
[1:16:45] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:16:48] he speak
[1:16:49] and he shall show you things to come
[1:16:53] for he shall glorify me
[1:16:56] or he shall receive of mine and shall
[1:16:58] show it unto you
[1:17:00] all things that the father has
[1:17:02] had are mine
[1:17:04] therefore said i
[1:17:06] that he shall take of mine and
[1:17:09] shall show it unto you
[1:17:12] now in this 13th verse
[1:17:14] how be it when the spirit of truth
[1:17:17] is come he will guide you unto all
[1:17:22] truth amen when the spirit of truth is
[1:17:24] come he will guide you into all truth
[1:17:28] what is truth
[1:17:30] the word
[1:17:32] for he shall speak you shall not speak
[1:17:34] of himself
[1:17:36] but what he hears he'll speak
[1:17:39] what he hears he'll speak in other words
[1:17:42] he'll be the one that will reveal the
[1:17:45] thing mercy
[1:17:47] and the fourth chapter of hebrews the
[1:17:49] bible said that the word of god is
[1:17:51] sharper more powerful than a two-aged
[1:17:52] sword a
[1:17:54] discerner of the thoughts of the mind
[1:17:57] the heart
[1:17:59] see what he hears he'll speak and he
[1:18:02] will show you things to come
[1:18:05] what's going to do that the holy spirit
[1:18:08] who will come in the name of the lord
[1:18:11] jesus
[1:18:12] and i would like to take these next few
[1:18:14] minutes to call your attention
[1:18:16] upon the word
[1:18:18] guide
[1:18:20] a guide
[1:18:22] you know
[1:18:23] i've had some quite experience
[1:18:26] in the woods
[1:18:28] a god someone to show you around
[1:18:32] you have to have a guide when you don't
[1:18:34] know where you're going
[1:18:36] and
[1:18:37] being acquainted with hunting and of the
[1:18:40] world around
[1:18:41] i've had
[1:18:43] the opportunity to meet guides
[1:18:45] and i am a guide myself in colorado
[1:18:49] because knowing the country
[1:18:52] ranching so forth i can guide
[1:18:55] in colorado
[1:18:56] now a guide has to know the way
[1:19:01] he has to know where he's going and what
[1:19:03] he's doing and how to take care of you
[1:19:04] along the road
[1:19:06] he's got to see that you don't come up
[1:19:09] lost
[1:19:11] a guide is a selected man
[1:19:13] the state selects this man
[1:19:16] if he is the guy
[1:19:18] and now in going on a trip
[1:19:21] into the wilderness where perhaps you're
[1:19:22] not used to going
[1:19:24] it's not a good thing
[1:19:26] for you to go without one
[1:19:28] frankly
[1:19:29] some places you can't even go without
[1:19:31] one
[1:19:32] for instance canada
[1:19:34] the
[1:19:35] the guide has to sign your license
[1:19:38] to the game warden you have to sign
[1:19:40] yourself in and he is responsible for
[1:19:43] you
[1:19:44] if anything happens to you it's his
[1:19:46] responsibility
[1:19:48] he's got to take care of you he's got to
[1:19:50] see that you're not lost he's got to be
[1:19:52] sure that he don't send you in somewhere
[1:19:54] that you don't owe your way back and if
[1:19:56] you do get lost he's got to know the
[1:19:58] country so well he can pick you up yes
[1:20:00] they need him
[1:20:01] he's got to know all these things or he
[1:20:04] cannot be a guy
[1:20:06] you cannot be licensed to be a guy
[1:20:08] for these things sometimes you have to
[1:20:11] have an appointment
[1:20:13] call ahead and make arrangements get
[1:20:16] reservations to be taken out
[1:20:20] and if you're uh
[1:20:22] sometimes he's filled up
[1:20:24] and he cannot take you you have to put
[1:20:25] it all for a while
[1:20:27] uh of the earthly god you never have to
[1:20:30] do that with god's god he's always ready
[1:20:33] always ready
[1:20:34] now
[1:20:36] if you don't get these preparations made
[1:20:39] and you're figuring on taking a trip
[1:20:40] into the wilderness where you haven't
[1:20:42] been before
[1:20:43] you may come up
[1:20:45] lost and perish
[1:20:47] you got about one percent chance to get
[1:20:50] out of the wilderness
[1:20:52] that is if it isn't too dense you might
[1:20:54] have one percent chance to get out
[1:20:57] by yourself
[1:20:58] but if it's a very bad wilderness way
[1:21:01] back you haven't got a chance to get out
[1:21:04] there's no way to do it because you find
[1:21:06] yourself on the death wall and then you
[1:21:08] you're done then you're finished now
[1:21:12] and you'll perish
[1:21:13] if you haven't got a guide that knows
[1:21:16] the country and knows how to get back
[1:21:19] many of you are acquainted with the
[1:21:20] article you have read last year
[1:21:23] out of tucson arizona
[1:21:25] those boy scouts
[1:21:27] yet they were trained
[1:21:29] to know how to take care of themselves
[1:21:32] they were scouts
[1:21:34] and they were not just cub scouts they
[1:21:36] were full scouts
[1:21:39] and they took a trip up into the
[1:21:41] mountains
[1:21:43] and a snow storm come
[1:21:45] nature changed its position
[1:21:48] and where they found themselves lost
[1:21:51] and all of them perished
[1:21:53] is because that they
[1:21:55] something change comes along from the
[1:21:58] regular routine they didn't know how to
[1:22:00] get out
[1:22:02] and i forget how many boys there was
[1:22:06] that perished in the mountain though
[1:22:08] they had helicopters and the militia out
[1:22:11] and the national guards and volunteer
[1:22:13] help and everything but they were lost
[1:22:16] no one know where they were at
[1:22:18] and they could not
[1:22:20] take care of themselves they all
[1:22:22] perished in the snow
[1:22:24] because they didn't know whether it was
[1:22:25] going east north west or south up or
[1:22:28] down or how it was everything looked the
[1:22:30] same
[1:22:30] now a guy knows where he's at
[1:22:34] regardless of the weather
[1:22:37] he's uh he's equipped to do that
[1:22:40] he knows what he's doing
[1:22:42] he's familiar with everything
[1:22:44] he knows the looks of everything
[1:22:46] so he can just be in the darkness he can
[1:22:49] feel a certain thing
[1:22:50] for instance here's an old trick to a
[1:22:52] guide
[1:22:53] you know if you can see the stars anyone
[1:22:55] can tell which way you're going if you
[1:22:57] watch the stars and you always want to
[1:22:59] watch the one true star there's only one
[1:23:02] true star and that's in our star the
[1:23:04] only one he stands in the same place
[1:23:07] that represents christ the same
[1:23:09] yesterday today forever
[1:23:12] others might wander away but he remains
[1:23:14] the same
[1:23:16] churches may draw you off this way or
[1:23:18] some draw you off that way but not him
[1:23:20] he's always the same
[1:23:22] well now if you can't see this north
[1:23:24] star and it's cloudy then if you'll
[1:23:27] notice if it's daytime
[1:23:29] and you're lost if you watch the trees
[1:23:32] the tree is always
[1:23:34] the moss is on the north side of the
[1:23:36] tree because the south side of the tree
[1:23:39] gets the sun more than the north side
[1:23:42] but what if it's dark and you can't see
[1:23:44] the moss if you close your eyes and
[1:23:46] don't try to do any thinking
[1:23:48] close your eyes and get a slick bark
[1:23:50] tree
[1:23:51] put your hands around the tree like this
[1:23:54] to your fingers neat
[1:23:55] and then start moving around that tree
[1:23:57] real slow
[1:23:59] and when you hit a place where the bark
[1:24:00] is real thick
[1:24:02] broke up that's the north side the wind
[1:24:06] and you can tell which way you're
[1:24:07] heading north or south and that way all
[1:24:10] there's many things but it takes guides
[1:24:13] to know how to do those things just an
[1:24:16] ordinary man could have been saying i
[1:24:17] don't feel no difference anything
[1:24:19] you've got to be trained for
[1:24:22] that guiding and these boys no doubt
[1:24:25] that they were fine scouts they might be
[1:24:27] able to not they might be able to make
[1:24:29] fires with rocks and so forth like that
[1:24:31] but to know your way out
[1:24:34] that's the honey
[1:24:36] they
[1:24:38] they did not know their way out so
[1:24:40] therefore they all perished because they
[1:24:43] didn't take a guide with them
[1:24:46] an unthoughtful father two years ago in
[1:24:48] colorado
[1:24:50] oh he's going up into the mountains he
[1:24:51] had a little boy about six seven years
[1:24:53] old just go take him on his first deer
[1:24:55] hunt
[1:24:56] so he went high up on the mountain and
[1:24:59] the little boy said to his daddy i'm
[1:25:01] getting tired get on my back we're not
[1:25:03] high enough up yet
[1:25:04] the viewers are high on all went to man
[1:25:07] until he got he didn't know he was a
[1:25:09] city man
[1:25:10] he didn't know nothing about how to hunt
[1:25:12] or where to go any man that knows
[1:25:14] anything about wilderness knows the deer
[1:25:16] don't stay up high
[1:25:17] they don't go up there goats stay up
[1:25:19] there not deer they're down where they
[1:25:20] can feed they got to get worthy
[1:25:21] something to eat
[1:25:22] and so but this man thought if i get way
[1:25:25] up in the rock somewhere up there i'll
[1:25:27] find a big buck he's seen a picture or
[1:25:28] something stand up on uh standing up on
[1:25:31] the rock and he thought that's where
[1:25:32] he'd find him don't pay attention in
[1:25:34] magazines read
[1:25:35] my oh my you'll have a nightmare
[1:25:38] there's only one thing to do is take a
[1:25:40] guy
[1:25:41] or you know where you're at and that
[1:25:43] father had come up a rain oh it was up
[1:25:45] there we'll have quick reigns that comes
[1:25:47] and the man hunted too late until it got
[1:25:50] dark and he couldn't find his way back
[1:25:53] and then the winds come across the top
[1:25:55] of the mountains and he himself moving
[1:25:57] fast and that you have to know how to
[1:25:59] survive
[1:26:00] if you're caught out there's another
[1:26:03] thing know how to survive i've climbed
[1:26:05] up trees and slid down and climbed up
[1:26:06] trees and slide down up and down like
[1:26:08] this to keep alive
[1:26:10] i'll tuck snow when it would be four
[1:26:12] foot on each side bust the stump and lay
[1:26:14] it down and so hungry that i couldn't
[1:26:15] hardly stand it and bust up these old
[1:26:17] stumps and light them and let it get hot
[1:26:19] and melt the snow down and then about
[1:26:21] one o'clock in the morning two o'clock
[1:26:22] pull the stumps back and lay down on
[1:26:24] that warm ground
[1:26:25] to keep alive and you have to know how
[1:26:29] to do these things
[1:26:30] and this man didn't know what he was
[1:26:32] doing he had nobody with him to direct
[1:26:33] him and he held his own little son
[1:26:36] against his bosom
[1:26:38] until he felt him cool off and died
[1:26:40] unthoughtful he just took a guide with
[1:26:43] him he could have brought him right back
[1:26:44] down the mountain regardless of what
[1:26:46] time it was see but he waited until it
[1:26:48] gets dark then he couldn't see his way
[1:26:51] around
[1:26:52] that's the trouble with christians today
[1:26:55] they wait till the darkness settles over
[1:26:57] then you find out that you've left
[1:26:59] without the god
[1:27:02] the god why did you ever see a man that
[1:27:05] was lost did anybody ever have the
[1:27:06] experience of bringing a man lost it's
[1:27:08] the most pitiful thing you've ever seen
[1:27:11] when a man gets lost he goes wow
[1:27:14] you don't know what he's doing
[1:27:15] we caught a man out there a boy and he'd
[1:27:18] been lost in the woods and he was
[1:27:20] thought he was a rancher but he's in a
[1:27:22] wrong territory and he got lost turned
[1:27:24] around and when they found him three
[1:27:26] days later he was running like a wild
[1:27:29] man screaming to the top of his voice
[1:27:31] his lips was all eat up
[1:27:33] and he threw his gun away and he didn't
[1:27:35] know what to do and when his own brother
[1:27:37] when they had to catch him the time when
[1:27:39] his own brother come to him he fought at
[1:27:41] him like an animal
[1:27:42] god divided he didn't know where he was
[1:27:45] at
[1:27:46] why he was lost
[1:27:49] when a man's lost
[1:27:51] he's in a state of bewildered
[1:27:55] and he don't know
[1:27:57] that he's in that state
[1:27:59] because his being lost
[1:28:02] sends his fever upon him then he doesn't
[1:28:04] know where he's at and how he's acting
[1:28:07] so is it when a man's lost from god
[1:28:10] he'll do things that he ordinary
[1:28:12] wouldn't do
[1:28:13] he'll do things that it's beyond the
[1:28:15] thoughts of a human being doing
[1:28:18] a lost man
[1:28:20] from god a lost church from god
[1:28:23] a church that's gone away from god
[1:28:26] got away from the principles of god's
[1:28:28] bible will do things that sometimes that
[1:28:31] you wouldn't expect to find in a church
[1:28:33] of the living god
[1:28:35] they'll get their money by bunker games
[1:28:37] playing lottery
[1:28:39] gambling anything that they can do
[1:28:42] they'll teach anything let anything get
[1:28:44] by pat man on their back who's big
[1:28:46] payers in the church and so forth like
[1:28:48] that to let them get by with it
[1:28:51] trying puck deacons on the boards been
[1:28:53] married four or five times
[1:28:55] just in order to get by with it to make
[1:28:58] ends meet there's only one in you've got
[1:29:00] to meet that's your obligation to god
[1:29:02] stand and tell the truth
[1:29:04] loss
[1:29:06] lost man
[1:29:07] is in a bewildered state he's a madman
[1:29:11] that god
[1:29:13] has understanding how to go on what to
[1:29:15] do
[1:29:16] god in
[1:29:17] god has always sent a guide to his
[1:29:20] people
[1:29:22] god has never failed
[1:29:25] he sends a god
[1:29:26] but you've got to accept that god
[1:29:30] you've got to believe it
[1:29:32] you've got to go the way he says
[1:29:36] if you get into a wilderness and your
[1:29:38] god says we go this way and yet you
[1:29:40] think you go that way
[1:29:41] you're going to come up lost
[1:29:44] now when you god sends us a god to guide
[1:29:47] us
[1:29:48] we've got to follow that
[1:29:50] guy no matter what we think
[1:29:53] what looks reasonable
[1:29:55] and what looks ridiculous
[1:29:57] we're not subjects to divide that
[1:30:01] the god is the only one
[1:30:05] god in the old testament sent prophets
[1:30:08] they were guides because the word of the
[1:30:10] lord came to the prophet they were
[1:30:12] guides they instructed the people as we
[1:30:15] had last night of isaiah
[1:30:18] uh and uh uzziah
[1:30:20] they was
[1:30:22] instructed and they instructed the
[1:30:24] people and guided them and now god has
[1:30:27] always sent his guides
[1:30:29] he's always never been without a god
[1:30:32] all through the ages god's always had
[1:30:34] somebody that represented him on this
[1:30:36] earth
[1:30:37] and all ages
[1:30:39] now sometimes they get off the guy off
[1:30:41] the beam as we call it
[1:30:42] when jesus is here on earth don't you
[1:30:44] remember jesus said to the pharisees you
[1:30:46] blind guides
[1:30:49] blind gods blind to spiritual things
[1:30:53] now they were supposed to be guide
[1:30:55] guides to the people
[1:30:57] guiding the people to salvation
[1:31:00] but jesus said you're blind
[1:31:03] and he said let them alone
[1:31:05] forth the blind lead the blind won't
[1:31:07] they for both follow the ditch
[1:31:10] blind guides
[1:31:12] oh how the world has been contaminated
[1:31:15] with that
[1:31:16] blind guiding
[1:31:19] he doesn't want you to rely on your own
[1:31:22] understanding
[1:31:24] god does not want you to rely on your
[1:31:27] understanding or your thoughts or any
[1:31:29] man-made thoughts
[1:31:31] god sends a guide and god wants you to
[1:31:34] remember that that's his appointed guide
[1:31:38] and we must remember him
[1:31:40] here it says jesus said i will not leave
[1:31:43] you but i'll pray the father and he'll
[1:31:45] send you another comforter and this
[1:31:47] comforter when he was to come was to
[1:31:50] guide us to all truth amen amen
[1:31:54] and the
[1:31:56] word of god is the truth
[1:31:59] and the word is christ
[1:32:02] i am the way the truth and the life
[1:32:06] he is the word in the beginning was the
[1:32:08] word the word is with god the word was
[1:32:10] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:32:12] dwelt among us
[1:32:13] then if we follow the real true god
[1:32:17] the holy spirit he was to
[1:32:20] tell us what he had seen what he had
[1:32:23] heard
[1:32:24] and he was to show us things that is to
[1:32:26] come
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:30] there you are
[1:32:31] he is going to show you things to come
[1:32:35] and when the churches today reject that
[1:32:39] how can we ever expect to go to heaven
[1:32:43] when the holy spirit was sent to us for
[1:32:46] a god
[1:32:47] we'll take some cardinal some bishop
[1:32:51] some general overseer
[1:32:53] or somebody like that to guide us
[1:32:56] when the holy spirit was given to us to
[1:32:59] guide us
[1:33:01] and the holy spirit always speaks all
[1:33:03] the word
[1:33:06] i've got many things to tell you
[1:33:08] you cannot understand it now but when he
[1:33:11] comes he'll guide you to it amen
[1:33:14] i believe that's the reason the coming
[1:33:15] of the seal
[1:33:17] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:33:20] mystery of god should be finished amen
[1:33:23] to know who god is
[1:33:25] what he is
[1:33:27] how he lives his nature his being you're
[1:33:29] supposed to be all the way up here by
[1:33:31] that time amen
[1:33:33] bring us into the full stature of sons
[1:33:36] and daughters of god a church that's
[1:33:39] washed in the blood of christ
[1:33:41] that's bought without money it's paid
[1:33:43] for by the blood of jesus christ
[1:33:46] now
[1:33:48] here we are
[1:33:49] a guide and he is god's
[1:33:53] provided god
[1:33:55] now we're going through a wilderness
[1:33:57] and we're on a road somewhere
[1:34:00] and we can't
[1:34:02] get along without this guy
[1:34:05] and dare anybody or try to substitute
[1:34:07] any other guy
[1:34:09] if you do he'll take you off the line
[1:34:13] this guy knows away
[1:34:15] he knows every inch of the way he knows
[1:34:18] every thought that's in your heart he
[1:34:20] knows everybody's here he knows who you
[1:34:22] are and what you've done and all about
[1:34:24] you
[1:34:26] god's god
[1:34:28] the holy spirit and will reveal things
[1:34:30] to you and will tell things that he's
[1:34:33] heard
[1:34:34] can repeat your words right back and say
[1:34:36] what you said
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:39] tell you what you've been what you got
[1:34:40] where you're going that's right
[1:34:43] a god
[1:34:44] the correct god and he will guide you to
[1:34:47] all truth and his word is the truth
[1:35:00] really not much could be added to that i
[1:35:02] thought it was pretty plain
[1:35:04] the real question is
[1:35:07] do you have one
[1:35:11] you know that that's the real question
[1:35:14] it is is our lives
[1:35:17] uh
[1:35:18] is our lives uh being led
[1:35:22] uh you know there's a difference in
[1:35:24] being believing
[1:35:26] and being led
[1:35:29] you can believe something you can
[1:35:30] believe things you know or and you can
[1:35:34] set up comfort and you can set up camp
[1:35:38] now remember as we've been going through
[1:35:40] this message this message is very timely
[1:35:42] because
[1:35:43] we we know that god doesn't change his
[1:35:46] mind about his word
[1:35:49] so if if when god created heavens and
[1:35:53] earth
[1:35:54] in the beginning he knew why that he
[1:35:56] created them
[1:35:58] he knew where they were going what they
[1:36:00] would be how the ages would change and
[1:36:04] how the things would come forth so god
[1:36:07] has a complete understanding of those
[1:36:10] things and so he mentions about a guide
[1:36:13] he said a guy has got to be able to take
[1:36:15] you in
[1:36:16] and take you out
[1:36:18] take you in and take you out well god
[1:36:21] took us in to this wilderness
[1:36:26] is that right
[1:36:28] in other words he knew in the beginning
[1:36:30] he allowed adam to fall
[1:36:33] and come from where that he was into the
[1:36:36] garden
[1:36:37] and go into the wilderness which is this
[1:36:41] world i believe this there's a song that
[1:36:43] goes something this world is old a
[1:36:46] wilderness you know i'm looking for my
[1:36:48] deliverance you know and so we find
[1:36:51] ourselves in this world that we're in
[1:36:54] and it's constantly changing
[1:36:58] if technology is changing the thinking
[1:37:01] of man is changing what they're teaching
[1:37:03] in school is changing how to even how to
[1:37:06] look upon one another it is changing and
[1:37:10] and
[1:37:12] things are just got so to the place that
[1:37:14] it's become such a sodom and gomorrah
[1:37:18] that we're to a place that we don't know
[1:37:21] our way out
[1:37:25] we don't know our way out
[1:37:27] we don't know how what we're going to do
[1:37:29] or or
[1:37:31] or do we know how to survive
[1:37:34] in this how are we going to fight these
[1:37:37] spirits how are we going to deal with
[1:37:41] those that have your
[1:37:43] children in public school when they
[1:37:45] begin to teach there's no god and they
[1:37:48] begin to teach you can't pray
[1:37:50] and and all the different things that
[1:37:53] are coming along you've got to
[1:37:55] understand this world has rejected god
[1:38:00] they are there i don't care what face
[1:38:02] they put on it or or what things i'll
[1:38:05] tell you you're gonna see the day
[1:38:07] they'll it's gonna be offensive to put
[1:38:09] in god we trust on our money
[1:38:11] you know what i mean they took the ten
[1:38:13] commandments out of the
[1:38:15] courthouse they had the ten commandments
[1:38:18] they took that out why what do you think
[1:38:20] this is it's two hundred thousand demon
[1:38:23] demons that are turned against the bride
[1:38:26] they're sent loose on the bride they're
[1:38:28] trying to change your landscape
[1:38:32] this used to be a christian country
[1:38:35] this used to be you you know like when i
[1:38:37] first came to texas remember those tip
[1:38:39] brothers and we had those blue laws you
[1:38:42] couldn't buy alcohol on sunday you with
[1:38:44] restaurants certain clothing stores
[1:38:47] weren't open they had all kinds of
[1:38:49] things they honored the sabbath
[1:38:55] but now they
[1:38:56] don't i think we're up to
[1:38:59] two o'clock on sunday now
[1:39:03] you know so maybe a drunk don't run into
[1:39:06] somebody that's coming home from church
[1:39:08] thank you
[1:39:11] you know
[1:39:12] bedford use didn't used to be what was
[1:39:15] called the dry city
[1:39:17] now we've got liquor stores
[1:39:19] you know there's a little church around
[1:39:21] the corner they call it the message
[1:39:23] church
[1:39:24] and and uh
[1:39:26] and uh you know the message
[1:39:29] a lot of people refer to the bible as
[1:39:31] the message i do too
[1:39:33] it's the message from god we just have
[1:39:36] the interpretated message so we got the
[1:39:39] real message but they turned that to a
[1:39:41] liquor store
[1:39:43] you know on my street corner where i
[1:39:45] come out i got a liquor store on each
[1:39:47] side of the street you don't think the
[1:39:49] landscape changed
[1:39:52] the political landscape has changed
[1:39:56] the
[1:39:57] uh
[1:39:58] educational landscape has changed the
[1:40:00] spiritual landscape has changed
[1:40:03] now that the church world believes that
[1:40:06] they can let any perversion in you just
[1:40:08] heard prophet of god tell it in other
[1:40:10] words it's starting to rain
[1:40:13] it's starting to snow
[1:40:15] the wind is starting to blow
[1:40:17] it's starting to get dark
[1:40:21] all these things you understand these
[1:40:23] descriptions that he gave that everybody
[1:40:26] was fine when they were walking in the
[1:40:28] light and walking in the sunlight and
[1:40:31] where everything looked the same and
[1:40:33] they could see and they could see the
[1:40:35] trees but when darkness came in
[1:40:38] and don't you understand that we are
[1:40:40] this is the end time it's either day or
[1:40:43] night at the time the light doesn't
[1:40:45] shine it's dark
[1:40:50] dark
[1:40:52] you know
[1:40:53] and
[1:40:54] and
[1:40:55] you come against things you look out and
[1:40:58] you think that it's it's good and if you
[1:41:01] go back and listen to this message it's
[1:41:04] if it's uh he
[1:41:06] testifies when he got lost
[1:41:08] in the woods and and how he went how he
[1:41:11] found and it and it goes much farther
[1:41:14] but
[1:41:16] when we come to the place
[1:41:18] that
[1:41:19] we can recognize
[1:41:22] that
[1:41:24] the conditions are really really rapidly
[1:41:30] around us not only changing economically
[1:41:36] you i you i listen to a little bit of
[1:41:39] news
[1:41:40] they're talking about food shortages
[1:41:43] how many of you have even considered
[1:41:46] that to be a reality
[1:41:50] no
[1:41:51] we're so fat and sassy
[1:41:56] we're so comfortable
[1:41:58] they're they're out there supply chain
[1:42:00] stories i go to the store i went to buy
[1:42:03] a mirror no mirrors
[1:42:05] i thought good
[1:42:10] no
[1:42:12] you understand
[1:42:14] we're not serious
[1:42:17] i guarantee you don't even think there's
[1:42:19] a chance in the world that you can get
[1:42:21] lost
[1:42:27] don't let he said don't let somebody
[1:42:29] another guy come come along and take you
[1:42:32] off in another direction don't let
[1:42:35] somebody else come and say this is the
[1:42:37] way this is the way uh this is what's
[1:42:40] gonna be look at the look at the the
[1:42:43] conditions
[1:42:45] you're saying if we were a christian
[1:42:47] nation
[1:42:48] and god was in our churches and god was
[1:42:51] in our pulpit then why are murders up
[1:42:54] more than they've ever been up why are
[1:42:57] robberies up why are cries crying up why
[1:43:00] is everything up
[1:43:04] because it's not having any effect you
[1:43:06] know why isn't it have any effect
[1:43:09] because they have no
[1:43:11] idea where they're going
[1:43:15] they don't know where they're going
[1:43:20] just think of it
[1:43:23] and they're getting matter and matter
[1:43:26] and matter the world don't know where
[1:43:27] they're going
[1:43:31] i mean at least because he showed us
[1:43:33] things to come
[1:43:35] we know there we know what this world's
[1:43:38] headed to
[1:43:40] so i it behooves me to ask myself
[1:43:48] what do i have
[1:43:51] that's going to lead me
[1:43:53] through these dark days
[1:43:56] that are so rapidly approaching
[1:44:00] do i have a guide
[1:44:03] because we're told don't go into the
[1:44:05] wilderness without one
[1:44:08] don't go don't take that trip
[1:44:11] don't go in there don't prepare don't go
[1:44:13] into where that
[1:44:15] that what you don't know
[1:44:18] don't don't be foolish enough
[1:44:22] to think that you possess the goods you
[1:44:25] hear what he called that man he said the
[1:44:27] unthoughtful father
[1:44:36] everybody's living for today
[1:44:39] like i said this is not a staying
[1:44:41] message
[1:44:42] this is a leaving message those boy
[1:44:45] scouts they knew how to stay
[1:44:49] they could tie their knots they could
[1:44:51] start their fires right they could do
[1:44:53] that but they didn't know their way out
[1:44:56] they didn't know their way out you know
[1:44:59] we hit ourselves in a lot of
[1:45:01] predicaments a lot of situations a lot
[1:45:03] of bad decisions a lot of things that
[1:45:06] come into our lives and and it causes us
[1:45:09] to get in financial fixes and and moral
[1:45:12] fixes and
[1:45:14] emotional fixes and all kinds of trouble
[1:45:17] you want to know something there's only
[1:45:18] one way to get out of that trouble is to
[1:45:22] have somebody that knows where they want
[1:45:25] to take you
[1:45:31] i've done a lot of counseling with
[1:45:32] people who have done a lot of things in
[1:45:34] their life
[1:45:36] and they don't know how to get rid of
[1:45:38] the guilt
[1:45:40] they don't know how to get rid of the
[1:45:42] shame
[1:45:43] they don't know how to take their eyes
[1:45:45] and turn them from the past
[1:45:48] to to the future
[1:45:50] they don't know how to take those they
[1:45:52] leave those things which are behind
[1:45:54] behind and press for a higher calling of
[1:45:57] christ
[1:45:59] but you've got to know when you sit down
[1:46:01] there and you talk to him you better
[1:46:04] know the god that can forgive you of all
[1:46:08] unrighteousness
[1:46:10] and the prophet of god said that guide
[1:46:12] has been there before and he knows it so
[1:46:15] well from beginning to end that he knows
[1:46:18] every bit of it i tell you i've been in
[1:46:21] this pits of hell
[1:46:24] i know a god that can take you from
[1:46:26] wherever darkness that you think you're
[1:46:29] in
[1:46:34] i've sat down with them
[1:46:39] you know and i i i left the catholic
[1:46:41] church
[1:46:42] a long time ago
[1:46:44] i don't believe in confessing sins
[1:46:48] and then doing penance
[1:46:50] i believe in confessing sins and having
[1:46:52] deliverance
[1:46:57] i believe in a god that can say you're
[1:46:58] forgiven and go and sin no more
[1:47:01] a god that can change a god that can
[1:47:04] make differences
[1:47:06] and you got we've got to have that guide
[1:47:10] none of us in here got this thing
[1:47:11] figured out
[1:47:14] i guarantee you we don't
[1:47:17] i have no idea what's going to come out
[1:47:20] of this country anymore
[1:47:23] i don't know what's going on in
[1:47:24] quote-unquote washington i don't know
[1:47:27] what's going on in the world i i don't
[1:47:30] know what china's doing i i don't know
[1:47:33] what all the people that are coming into
[1:47:35] our country a hundred you know 95 000
[1:47:39] people are
[1:47:40] marching to our border right now in
[1:47:43] texas
[1:47:46] it's going on
[1:47:50] and i know that we we don't care because
[1:47:54] we just get up in our morning
[1:47:56] and we you know as long as we got some
[1:47:59] little cream of wheat i'm sitting on the
[1:48:01] table and we're going to go to our
[1:48:02] little work and we're going to come a
[1:48:04] little home and we're going to live in
[1:48:06] our little world
[1:48:07] and and we don't even realize
[1:48:12] how many people in egypt
[1:48:15] got up
[1:48:16] that morning i didn't know the death
[1:48:18] angel was coming
[1:48:22] but some people had a guide
[1:48:26] and they told them they needed to apply
[1:48:28] the blood to the post
[1:48:30] they needed the uh passover meal ready
[1:48:34] they they needed to be ready to
[1:48:36] go forward
[1:48:39] now
[1:48:41] we understand
[1:48:43] that
[1:48:44] the guide if he's a guide we just heard
[1:48:47] these definitions and i know that all of
[1:48:49] you are spiritual enough to understand
[1:48:52] that not only was that related to the
[1:48:56] spirit but the spirit in our day
[1:48:59] according to the word of god was going
[1:49:03] to come
[1:49:04] and take on the form of a prophet
[1:49:10] in other words because spirit was going
[1:49:13] to expressly speak
[1:49:15] through the ministry of malachi 4 5
[1:49:19] that he was going to use the sign of
[1:49:23] revelations 10 7 to show that he was a
[1:49:27] heaven-sent guy
[1:49:31] and he was going as he this was 1962
[1:49:35] he makes references to the seals
[1:49:42] you know it wasn't the seals he says
[1:49:44] that's why these upcoming seals let me
[1:49:47] just read it
[1:49:50] listen to this
[1:49:53] and the holy ghost always speaks of the
[1:49:56] word
[1:49:58] i've got many things to tell you you
[1:50:00] cannot understand
[1:50:03] it now
[1:50:05] but when he comes
[1:50:08] he'll guide you
[1:50:10] to it
[1:50:14] now listen he's got guiding us to
[1:50:17] something
[1:50:19] that's the reason
[1:50:22] the coming of the seals
[1:50:28] you don't think he knew those seals were
[1:50:30] coming
[1:50:31] he's a guide
[1:50:35] he knows where to take us
[1:50:37] he knows what to take us to
[1:50:41] you're very privileged people
[1:50:45] to have god
[1:50:46] god sends you a guide
[1:50:50] that is going to lead you through this
[1:50:53] dark time
[1:50:54] but you want to know something you've
[1:50:56] got to have confidence in that guy
[1:50:59] you've got to believe that guy you've
[1:51:02] got to put all your trust in him you
[1:51:04] can't be holding back
[1:51:10] there there comes a time you just got to
[1:51:12] humble yourself
[1:51:14] to it and let them do
[1:51:17] what that he wants to do he says i tell
[1:51:20] you
[1:51:22] he says
[1:51:23] at the finishing of the seven seals
[1:51:30] the mystery
[1:51:32] of god should be finished
[1:51:35] to know who god is
[1:51:40] now this is what he's guiding us to
[1:51:44] okay in other words the guide has got to
[1:51:47] know where he's taking you to
[1:51:50] isn't that right
[1:51:52] so now he's telling us
[1:51:55] at the finishing of the seals this guy
[1:51:58] the holy spirit back then he said i can
[1:52:02] have many things to tell you
[1:52:05] but i can't tell you now
[1:52:08] so he comes back in our day
[1:52:11] veiled in the ministry of a prophet
[1:52:14] that's right the same word
[1:52:17] the same spirit
[1:52:21] now he's going to tell us those things
[1:52:23] that he couldn't share with us then
[1:52:26] because it would be too hard for us to
[1:52:29] bear
[1:52:31] and he's going to tell us of things
[1:52:34] to come
[1:52:41] you know what
[1:52:43] the things he said are coming our cup
[1:52:45] are here
[1:52:46] and it's not even affecting our lives
[1:52:49] it's not making us any more prayer it
[1:52:52] don't make us we still miss communion we
[1:52:54] still miss foot washing we still we
[1:52:57] still aren't dedicated to service we
[1:52:59] still don't give our offerings our
[1:53:01] tithings we don't have any good works
[1:53:04] we're still pursuing the world
[1:53:10] the snow's falling the rain's falling
[1:53:13] the sun's setting it's dark
[1:53:20] and he said everybody always waits
[1:53:23] till it's too
[1:53:24] late
[1:53:27] to get the guide
[1:53:29] do you think brother graham is just
[1:53:30] telling stories
[1:53:32] you think he suffered the way he
[1:53:34] suffered
[1:53:36] the criticism and the mockery and
[1:53:39] bearing the burden of the gift that made
[1:53:42] him an oddball
[1:53:44] thank god
[1:53:47] amen
[1:53:49] you said well he wanted to be somebody
[1:53:51] that was the most nobody man
[1:53:53] you would have ever met
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:58] and he could have
[1:54:03] could have been wealthy
[1:54:05] look at his church our church is better
[1:54:07] than the church he had
[1:54:12] did he had theater seats
[1:54:15] and remember they were working on the
[1:54:17] air conditioning and the place would get
[1:54:18] hot
[1:54:20] he wasn't going to build a kingdom here
[1:54:25] and and
[1:54:26] so
[1:54:28] in other words a guide
[1:54:30] he
[1:54:31] he's almost got to become one with that
[1:54:34] wilderness
[1:54:37] you understand he's got to know
[1:54:39] what the signs are what the things are
[1:54:42] and and the guy shows you know why a guy
[1:54:44] tells you these things as you go
[1:54:47] i've had a guide
[1:54:49] and i i'd look at him and said man
[1:54:51] i think he's lost
[1:54:57] not only that i thought he was crazy
[1:55:01] anybody turned around to me says we're
[1:55:02] going to go up here about another 300
[1:55:04] yards and there'll be some barbed wire
[1:55:07] finale on this fence
[1:55:10] on this tree up here where they ran a
[1:55:12] temporary cattle line down there
[1:55:16] you know pumping up there man you don't
[1:55:17] know what it felt like to feel let's see
[1:55:19] that bob wire there
[1:55:20] at least he knows he's here
[1:55:25] well how many times does he have to show
[1:55:28] us
[1:55:31] that we're here
[1:55:35] to where we're going to understand this
[1:55:37] guide is
[1:55:39] taking us
[1:55:40] someplace
[1:55:44] you understand the the guide isn't a you
[1:55:47] know like a tour guide this guy ain't a
[1:55:50] tour guide
[1:55:54] you know i i i've been overseas and i i
[1:55:58] you know into her and my first trip over
[1:56:00] there i took rick steve's book
[1:56:03] and i looked like every other tourist
[1:56:05] walking around there and that's where
[1:56:07] everybody was going everybody was going
[1:56:09] to
[1:56:10] the places in the book
[1:56:12] well i found out i don't even need take
[1:56:14] the book they've got the book i'll just
[1:56:16] follow them
[1:56:19] and i just walked up and said what did
[1:56:20] he say well what do you think the most
[1:56:22] crowded restaurants in the whole city
[1:56:24] were
[1:56:25] the ones in the tour guide
[1:56:30] you know what denominations are their
[1:56:31] tour guides
[1:56:33] they're just showing you the sights
[1:56:37] they're showing you what's ben
[1:56:41] they're showing you history
[1:56:44] this is what it was this is what it used
[1:56:46] to be this is it isn't it pretty isn't
[1:56:49] it nice
[1:56:53] but a real guy
[1:56:56] is guiding you through where you've
[1:56:59] never
[1:57:01] been
[1:57:03] now it's up to you to decide
[1:57:09] whether or not
[1:57:11] you need them
[1:57:16] and i'm not talking about as a body of
[1:57:18] believers
[1:57:21] i'm not talking as a married couple i'm
[1:57:24] talking as an individual
[1:57:28] you want do you want to have a marriage
[1:57:30] get put back together and be in great
[1:57:33] shape right away if you're having
[1:57:36] troubles and fussing people get married
[1:57:38] and they fuss
[1:57:40] now leslie was always smarter enough to
[1:57:42] fuss she'd never fussed with me
[1:57:46] never talk back or nothing i think she
[1:57:48] just prayed me around
[1:57:54] you know that's all she'd have to do
[1:57:56] just pray me around if i must say pray
[1:57:57] me out i wouldn't be upset
[1:57:59] i want to do this praying me this way
[1:58:01] pray me that but drink me that way
[1:58:03] hallelujah
[1:58:05] you don't have to you know something you
[1:58:07] both get the same kind
[1:58:09] hey brother brown goes and he says he
[1:58:10] doesn't guide us different ways
[1:58:13] he keeps us together because we're all
[1:58:16] going to the same place but we're going
[1:58:19] to where we've never
[1:58:21] been before
[1:58:25] you understand me spiritually
[1:58:29] we're going to i believe that we're
[1:58:31] going to receive things of the father
[1:58:34] that we've never received before
[1:58:37] we're going to have measures of faith
[1:58:40] that we've never had before
[1:58:42] and there's only one way to get there
[1:58:45] there's only one way to reach that
[1:58:47] there's only way one way to understand
[1:58:50] that is first of all you've got to hire
[1:58:53] he said in the natural you've got to
[1:58:56] hire yourself a guide well in this case
[1:58:59] he said god never leaves his people
[1:59:03] without of god
[1:59:05] you as an individual in your life
[1:59:08] whatever your education level is
[1:59:10] whatever your upbringing is whatever
[1:59:13] your
[1:59:14] ethnicity is whatever your cultural
[1:59:17] background is that doesn't mean one
[1:59:20] thing because he sends you a guide and
[1:59:24] the guide is going to take the african
[1:59:26] the mexican the irish the anglo the
[1:59:30] chinese the japanese i don't care how
[1:59:33] many of them you can name he's gonna all
[1:59:35] take him to the same place
[1:59:39] and because he's never changed his mind
[1:59:42] about his word he's going to take him
[1:59:45] the same way
[1:59:52] you see
[1:59:54] he can't change
[1:59:57] the way
[2:00:00] because he can't change his mind about
[2:00:03] his word
[2:00:06] so we wednesday night we said you're the
[2:00:09] word that he can't change his mind about
[2:00:14] so he when he saw you
[2:00:18] right the color of your hair the statue
[2:00:22] your eyes what you are he saw you now
[2:00:26] that's why the battle's in the mind
[2:00:28] because he's always telling you that's
[2:00:30] not true and i'm telling you it is true
[2:00:33] your name's on the lamb's book of life
[2:00:35] you're one of his i don't care what he
[2:00:38] tells you that's the word of the lord to
[2:00:40] you
[2:00:48] satan says he's you know i had this
[2:00:51] saying growing up it helped me
[2:00:53] if ands buts and wise are all satan's
[2:00:57] lies
[2:01:02] you know
[2:01:03] if god loves you
[2:01:05] if
[2:01:09] you know
[2:01:11] the word of god says this but
[2:01:16] this will and you ever add your and i
[2:01:19] did this well let me tell you and this
[2:01:21] is the reason and this is that and then
[2:01:23] you know look they're all things god's
[2:01:25] word is the same amount he doesn't
[2:01:28] change his mind about it
[2:01:31] so in other words he
[2:01:34] he knew where he was taking you
[2:01:41] he knew where he was taking you he let
[2:01:44] you come into this wilderness
[2:01:47] and now he's going to take you out of it
[2:01:51] we're in going out time we're in the
[2:01:54] time of being taken out
[2:01:57] he let us come into this wilderness
[2:02:00] so we could be conformed
[2:02:03] into the image of his son
[2:02:07] he knew what it would take
[2:02:10] to leave here
[2:02:12] what does it take to leave here it takes
[2:02:15] the same spirit
[2:02:17] that dwelt in him to dwell in you
[2:02:21] to take you there
[2:02:24] now let's let's listen again further
[2:02:28] he said
[2:02:29] at the finishing of the seven seals the
[2:02:31] mysteries of god should be finished to
[2:02:33] know who god is
[2:02:37] what he is
[2:02:41] how he lives
[2:02:43] his nature
[2:02:45] his being
[2:02:50] that's what the guide's going to do
[2:02:52] he's going to tell you he's not a
[2:02:54] trinitarian
[2:02:58] he's not three spirits
[2:03:02] he's one
[2:03:04] he's got one thought
[2:03:08] how he thinks
[2:03:11] you know
[2:03:12] it it
[2:03:14] it's beautiful
[2:03:15] how he lives
[2:03:17] his nature his being
[2:03:20] you're supposed to be
[2:03:22] all the way up here
[2:03:25] by that time
[2:03:32] that that's where we're supposed to be
[2:03:35] another the guide is sitting here
[2:03:37] telling us this is where we ought to be
[2:03:40] we ought to be way up here and let me
[2:03:43] just finish the quote because it ties
[2:03:44] everything so beautifully together
[2:03:46] you're supposed to be
[2:03:48] be all the way up here by that time see
[2:03:51] bringing us
[2:03:53] into
[2:03:54] the full stature
[2:03:56] of sons and daughters of god
[2:04:00] a church
[2:04:02] that's washed in the blood of jesus
[2:04:04] christ
[2:04:06] that's
[2:04:07] bought
[2:04:08] without money is paid for by the blood
[2:04:12] of jesus christ
[2:04:15] look that's where so the the guide
[2:04:19] knows where he's taking us
[2:04:22] so in other words jesus knew
[2:04:25] because the holy spirit in jesus is the
[2:04:27] same thing the spirit the spirit of god
[2:04:29] in creation the invisible things around
[2:04:31] us are clearly seen uh the invisible
[2:04:34] things are clearly seen by the visible
[2:04:36] things around us that same spirit now
[2:04:38] makes flesh
[2:04:41] begotten a son
[2:04:43] creates a body
[2:04:45] a kinsmen
[2:04:47] without sin
[2:04:50] came through the same way but he was the
[2:04:52] father created both a
[2:04:55] female part and male part to brought
[2:04:58] them together by the spoken word
[2:05:01] brought forth a body like in ours
[2:05:05] tempted
[2:05:06] the same way we're tempted
[2:05:09] fatigued suffered pain everything like
[2:05:12] we were so he could be a kinsmen
[2:05:16] pay the price for us
[2:05:18] so we could be redeemed
[2:05:20] and then sent us back a guide
[2:05:27] to lead us
[2:05:28] to what that he had in mind in the
[2:05:31] beginning
[2:05:33] that's what god can't change his mind
[2:05:35] about
[2:05:37] he can't change his mind about the image
[2:05:40] that he had of you
[2:05:42] in the beginning
[2:05:45] he knew
[2:05:46] what he created
[2:05:48] and i i have the quote laying on my desk
[2:05:51] and i'll just i'll just uh
[2:05:54] say it out the way that bill graham said
[2:05:56] it he said that god put in every seed
[2:05:59] that he planted the power within that
[2:06:02] seed to transform into what that he made
[2:06:06] it to be
[2:06:09] if you have an apple seed
[2:06:12] that's that power doesn't come from any
[2:06:16] place else it's in the seed
[2:06:18] if that seed is planted
[2:06:22] in the conditions
[2:06:24] that god spoke for that seed to be
[2:06:28] transformed in it'll grow
[2:06:32] the atmosphere
[2:06:35] the elements
[2:06:38] everything is all part
[2:06:41] of the plan
[2:06:42] of bringing that seed to life
[2:06:48] now
[2:06:50] i want you to send your life
[2:06:53] the world that you're in
[2:06:57] the job the heir the people you've
[2:07:00] married the family around you and all
[2:07:02] that is all part
[2:07:07] of
[2:07:08] the earth
[2:07:11] that god planted that seed in
[2:07:14] to bring it forth
[2:07:18] you understand what i'm saying so you
[2:07:20] can't compare yourself
[2:07:22] to somebody else you can't compare your
[2:07:25] trials to somebody else you can't look
[2:07:28] at somebody else and say they're blessed
[2:07:33] i've watched people that i thought man
[2:07:35] they got everything in life blow their
[2:07:37] brains out they were missing something
[2:07:42] maybe they just didn't have what i had
[2:07:47] then i realized well in order to get
[2:07:49] what they've got i've got to trade my
[2:07:51] soul for the demon that gave it to him i
[2:07:54] ain't ready to do that
[2:07:56] i believe there's something else don't
[2:07:57] you i believe there's someplace better i
[2:08:00] believe there's a place where i'm never
[2:08:02] going to die i believe that i can
[2:08:04] receive
[2:08:05] the earnest of that expectation
[2:08:09] now
[2:08:10] in this life
[2:08:14] so god
[2:08:15] he totally
[2:08:16] understands
[2:08:19] what that he made
[2:08:22] and what that he planted
[2:08:25] and what he wanted that seed to be
[2:08:29] and he knew that that seed
[2:08:32] because we can see the visible things
[2:08:34] the hidden things of god are clearly
[2:08:37] seen in the things around us we can
[2:08:39] understand you cannot plant bananas in
[2:08:42] canada
[2:08:45] i would recommend if someone's going to
[2:08:47] sell you a canadian grown banana
[2:08:50] that that thing is a hot house hybrid
[2:08:53] something or other
[2:08:58] now you can grow weed up there
[2:09:05] you can
[2:09:06] they got miles and miles and miles and
[2:09:09] miles of it
[2:09:12] but you can't grow it
[2:09:14] because
[2:09:15] the atmosphere
[2:09:17] and the conditions
[2:09:19] and the nutrients and the situations
[2:09:24] were all necessary
[2:09:27] for it to bring forth
[2:09:30] your very life
[2:09:32] the way you got converted the life you
[2:09:35] were brought up in the people you were
[2:09:37] raised how everything around your life
[2:09:40] you might look back and says my life's a
[2:09:42] shipwreck
[2:09:44] well it took a shipwreck
[2:09:47] for you
[2:09:51] well i messed up here and i messed up
[2:09:53] here and i got involved with this person
[2:09:55] and i got involved with that person and
[2:09:57] i shouldn't have done that and i
[2:09:58] shouldn't have done that you know what
[2:10:01] all becomes part of it
[2:10:03] he who has forgiven much can love much
[2:10:10] we can't fix nothing
[2:10:15] you know a person doesn't get out in the
[2:10:17] wilderness to say i'm lost i'm going to
[2:10:18] turn this into a desert
[2:10:21] so i can see
[2:10:25] he's got to lead you from where you are
[2:10:32] a lot of search parties have went in for
[2:10:35] people and got lost themselves
[2:10:39] a lot of people have jumped in into
[2:10:41] rivers and waters to save people and
[2:10:43] perished
[2:10:47] somebody has got to know what they're
[2:10:49] doing
[2:10:51] now i'm persuaded
[2:10:55] and this is also in the message by
[2:10:57] divine vindicated revelation
[2:11:02] that god has provided us a guide
[2:11:07] someone who can take us out
[2:11:10] amen
[2:11:12] amen
[2:11:14] because we can't see
[2:11:19] it doesn't matter what comes or goes we
[2:11:21] can't understand it we don't know but if
[2:11:24] we'll place our confidence in that guide
[2:11:29] then we understand that god's provided
[2:11:32] us something
[2:11:34] that will take us from where we are
[2:11:37] to what it is that he wants us to be
[2:11:42] in other words he's not just taking us
[2:11:45] from one mess to another
[2:11:49] you understand that he's just not taking
[2:11:52] us from one fix to the other he's got
[2:11:55] an intended
[2:11:57] outcome
[2:11:58] for his word
[2:12:01] so if we understand that he's taking us
[2:12:04] someplace so what if what is he trying
[2:12:06] to do i like to read the scriptures if i
[2:12:08] could ins in
[2:12:10] the gospel of saint john
[2:12:15] and the
[2:12:18] and the the verse uh
[2:12:20] chapter 4 of the first four verses
[2:12:32] he said beloved
[2:12:34] believe not every spirit
[2:12:38] but try the spirits whether
[2:12:41] they are of god
[2:12:43] because many false prophets are going
[2:12:47] out into the world
[2:12:52] try the spirit
[2:12:55] in other words where is it guiding you
[2:12:57] to
[2:12:59] what is it guiding it to what what is it
[2:13:03] that
[2:13:04] that and and it lies right within your
[2:13:07] own conscience
[2:13:10] if you really look down in your heart
[2:13:13] you know balaam never loved those people
[2:13:16] anyway
[2:13:17] he hated him he hated what they stood
[2:13:19] for he didn't like the fact they were
[2:13:21] poor he didn't like nothing about him so
[2:13:24] really what began to rule balaam was his
[2:13:27] heart
[2:13:28] that's why he kept going to try to
[2:13:31] change
[2:13:32] uh
[2:13:33] the word of god to match his heart
[2:13:38] i was looking for my book i know it's
[2:13:39] just right up here but there's a
[2:13:41] quote in it
[2:13:43] i'm the only guy in the world can lose a
[2:13:45] book right in front of him in this much
[2:13:46] space
[2:13:50] but
[2:13:55] he he
[2:13:56] he says he says listen to this he said
[2:13:58] brother
[2:14:00] you judge god
[2:14:02] by his word
[2:14:04] he keeps his word
[2:14:06] and identifies it the truth
[2:14:10] so remember friend
[2:14:12] as this is in uh does god ever change
[2:14:15] his mind about his word paragraph 187
[2:14:19] he says he keeps his word
[2:14:21] and identifies it the truth so remember
[2:14:25] friend as long as you live
[2:14:28] don't you never forget this
[2:14:31] god doesn't change his mind
[2:14:36] yet
[2:14:36] he'll bless
[2:14:38] he will let you go in his permissive
[2:14:41] will
[2:14:42] but he won't change his mind
[2:14:46] he won't change his plan
[2:14:49] he won't change his word for
[2:14:52] you
[2:14:53] no sir
[2:14:55] you know that's that's a paradoxical
[2:14:57] statement in other words he's not going
[2:14:59] to change his word for you
[2:15:01] and in another route he's not going to
[2:15:02] change his word for you
[2:15:06] otherwise i'm not going to change my
[2:15:08] thoughts of you i'm not going to change
[2:15:10] my plan for you
[2:15:12] and there's another space he's looking
[2:15:14] at someone that wants it changed
[2:15:18] and that's what balaam did he wanted the
[2:15:21] plan changed
[2:15:25] oh
[2:15:27] i got to say am i am i becoming a
[2:15:29] balaamite
[2:15:32] i want the pre-planned plan that god has
[2:15:35] for me
[2:15:37] the route that he's taking me
[2:15:40] the route that he's leading me on the
[2:15:43] afflictions the situations the
[2:15:45] circumstances the mental battles the
[2:15:48] spiritual battles the hurt the pain
[2:15:54] i get my feelings hurt
[2:15:58] it drove me into deep deep
[2:16:01] self-consciousness
[2:16:05] i learned to protect myself by not
[2:16:07] getting close to anybody
[2:16:11] i'd never turn my spirit
[2:16:13] into anybody's hands and let them ever
[2:16:15] hurt me again
[2:16:19] it's hard to be like that and be
[2:16:20] christ-like
[2:16:23] i needed someone to take me out of that
[2:16:28] i would have become a recluse
[2:16:31] sounds good to me today sometimes
[2:16:34] it does
[2:16:36] but he's not going to change it
[2:16:40] he's not going to change his plan for
[2:16:43] you
[2:16:45] another that's what balaam did he wanted
[2:16:47] to change the plan i want to change the
[2:16:49] plan i i don't want to go this way
[2:16:52] hey guide i don't want to cross that
[2:16:54] stream
[2:16:58] you want to go a different way
[2:17:01] yeah i don't want to cross the stream
[2:17:03] okay we're going to go all the way up
[2:17:04] this mountain
[2:17:06] all the way up this hill through this
[2:17:08] direction all of these stones and
[2:17:09] valleys you know what he's going to do
[2:17:11] he's going to bring you back to that
[2:17:13] stream and now you're ready to cross it
[2:17:16] oh i'll be glad to cross this dream
[2:17:21] because he can't change his mind about
[2:17:25] his word
[2:17:26] he's the guide
[2:17:29] he knows where he's taking you he knows
[2:17:32] what he's taking you through
[2:17:35] he knows what he's what the finished
[2:17:37] product is going to be right the statue
[2:17:39] of a perfect man so he's going to take
[2:17:42] you through faith he's going to take you
[2:17:43] through virtue
[2:17:46] he's going to take you through
[2:17:51] i guess knowledge
[2:17:53] he's going to take you through those
[2:17:55] places and there's a guide takes you
[2:17:57] from one point to the next point
[2:18:01] to the next point
[2:18:03] to the next point because there's no
[2:18:06] other way to get there
[2:18:09] there's no other way to get
[2:18:12] to the statue of the perfect man
[2:18:14] but to put you through the situations
[2:18:17] where you have to have faith
[2:18:21] that's right
[2:18:23] or virtue
[2:18:25] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[2:18:30] and then the capstone of love where we
[2:18:32] should be
[2:18:34] but you're never going to fall into that
[2:18:36] love until you have a hundred percent
[2:18:39] confidence that he's leading your life
[2:18:44] and you're willing to lay your life down
[2:18:49] he who saves his life
[2:18:52] shall lose it
[2:18:54] but he who loses his life
[2:18:57] shall save it
[2:19:00] we've got to come to that place
[2:19:03] where we understand
[2:19:05] he's in control
[2:19:08] he's the guide i'm going to follow him
[2:19:12] he is not going to forsake me
[2:19:15] i will never leave you nor forsake you
[2:19:19] but i personal pronoun will be with you
[2:19:22] even until the end
[2:19:25] i go away where it's needful for me to
[2:19:27] go away
[2:19:29] so you can develop as an individual into
[2:19:33] the vision that god had of you in his
[2:19:37] mind in the beginning and he can't
[2:19:39] change that
[2:19:40] he's the keeper of that
[2:19:45] he's got to keep you
[2:19:49] he's got to fulfill his word in order to
[2:19:52] remain god
[2:19:55] and there's only one thing that god
[2:19:57] can't do is fail
[2:19:59] so you're lost out in the wilderness
[2:20:01] you're confused churches confuse people
[2:20:06] preachers have done things and taught
[2:20:08] things and and handled situations that
[2:20:11] have made people to turn away from god
[2:20:18] i've talked to many a young man
[2:20:21] that have that's been in school
[2:20:24] and they get some teacher
[2:20:27] who's who's bitter and
[2:20:29] tired of life
[2:20:32] and that teacher stuck there
[2:20:36] maybe you're in ninth grade or tenth
[2:20:38] grade and you get a teacher and you
[2:20:39] can't stand them you know where that
[2:20:41] teacher is going to be five years from
[2:20:43] now in that classroom
[2:20:45] why let that one person
[2:20:49] ruin a life that you've got ahead of you
[2:20:53] why let that one boss
[2:20:56] pack up your tools
[2:20:59] you pack up your tools one time you'll
[2:21:01] be packing up the tools the rest of your
[2:21:03] life
[2:21:06] because there will always be someone
[2:21:07] there to get under your skin
[2:21:09] but if you could ever realize wait a
[2:21:12] minute god put this guy here
[2:21:15] this is the way he's taking me this guy
[2:21:18] is on my journey to perfection this
[2:21:21] tribulation is on my journey to
[2:21:24] perfection it's going to perform in me
[2:21:31] the and make come to life
[2:21:35] the step and the
[2:21:37] place of virtue
[2:21:39] that i'm supposed to go to
[2:21:41] because the guide is leading us from
[2:21:44] step to step into perfection
[2:21:50] let's just read down know every spirit
[2:21:54] he says hereby know ye the spirit of god
[2:21:58] even the spirit that confesses that
[2:22:01] jesus christ is come in the flesh is of
[2:22:04] god
[2:22:07] what is jesus
[2:22:09] the word
[2:22:11] what flesh is he coming into
[2:22:18] come on
[2:22:19] this is our confession
[2:22:22] that the word
[2:22:24] right is god's thought
[2:22:27] in the beginning the spoken word was
[2:22:29] original seed that thought that god had
[2:22:33] of me is going to come
[2:22:36] in the flesh
[2:22:40] that's why the prophet told us he says
[2:22:42] he is word you are word
[2:22:45] the word became flesh now the flesh is
[2:22:48] becoming what
[2:22:49] word
[2:22:51] look what the guide is telling us i i'm
[2:22:54] going to tell you what he is i'm going
[2:22:56] to tell you how he thinks i'm going to
[2:22:58] tell you how he lives
[2:23:00] i'm going to tell you what he had in
[2:23:02] mind you can't bear it now but i'm going
[2:23:05] to show you things that are to come
[2:23:09] now he's back
[2:23:13] being made flesh
[2:23:16] invisible union of the bride how many
[2:23:19] sermons could
[2:23:20] we go through
[2:23:21] that he knows he doing that he's come in
[2:23:24] the flesh
[2:23:25] so that thought that god had
[2:23:28] he's got to guide you
[2:23:32] along any road that it would take
[2:23:36] in order to bring you to the place and
[2:23:39] the thought that he had of you in the
[2:23:41] beginning
[2:23:46] now you looked at paul and said paul
[2:23:50] it's hard to kick your
[2:23:52] against the prick
[2:24:00] do do you understand that do you believe
[2:24:02] that for you
[2:24:06] are you hoping
[2:24:08] to just get out
[2:24:11] i don't want to hope to get out
[2:24:15] if i could use the carnal thing
[2:24:18] is i want to get my guide now
[2:24:23] i want to resolve in my heart
[2:24:27] today
[2:24:29] that i need a guide
[2:24:37] you know how
[2:24:38] how many single mothers we have single
[2:24:40] teenage mothers across this country
[2:24:49] because they just let some
[2:24:51] little boy flash
[2:24:52] their eyes at them and
[2:24:55] and
[2:24:57] say
[2:24:58] words and
[2:25:00] work on their emotion
[2:25:04] just what satan did to ever
[2:25:10] you know
[2:25:14] and
[2:25:16] if if they had a guide
[2:25:20] or they reject the guide
[2:25:26] you know parents say that boy's no good
[2:25:29] don't hang around that boy don't go with
[2:25:31] that boy
[2:25:32] oh no mama he's a good boy he's got a
[2:25:35] hundred hours of community service
[2:25:44] you know you don't listen to the guide
[2:25:48] you're going to do it your way
[2:25:51] uh-huh
[2:25:52] and then you know you end up with a baby
[2:25:55] and then you just pray to god some guy
[2:25:57] is going to come along and accept that
[2:26:00] baby is his
[2:26:02] no i can't do nothing about the past
[2:26:09] but i can guide the
[2:26:13] those that
[2:26:14] i can at least share the truth with
[2:26:18] how many things
[2:26:21] how much you know why do we have drug
[2:26:23] addicts like we've got in alcoholics and
[2:26:26] all these things you know why they're
[2:26:29] substitutes
[2:26:32] the only way to get out of it is to get
[2:26:34] the guide that can take you out
[2:26:37] the only way to get out of the place you
[2:26:39] are in is get back with the guy you got
[2:26:42] trouble in your marriage you know what i
[2:26:43] can sit down with you in five minutes
[2:26:45] and tell you why you're gonna have
[2:26:46] trouble you don't listen to tapes
[2:26:48] together you don't read your bible
[2:26:49] together you don't pray together and
[2:26:52] you're not confident in your own
[2:26:53] salvation
[2:26:58] that was a marriage seminar
[2:27:03] really
[2:27:06] are you both trying to leave
[2:27:10] or did you marry a fashion model
[2:27:16] you don't want to marry a fashion model
[2:27:19] i want to marry someone i'm going to
[2:27:20] spend eternity with
[2:27:23] i'm over
[2:27:24] these are things brother graham said i
[2:27:25] want to marry someone that's going to
[2:27:26] raise my children be a good mother
[2:27:30] he told us what to look for
[2:27:36] many of you want children
[2:27:38] that's a desirable thing you have a
[2:27:40] scripture
[2:27:41] you're saved through
[2:27:42] childbearing we need to get out of the
[2:27:45] woes me
[2:27:48] and we need to start laying hold of the
[2:27:49] promise of god and say god has brought
[2:27:52] me this route
[2:27:55] because there's something that he's
[2:27:57] trying to perform in me and
[2:27:59] create in me
[2:28:01] amen he is the potter
[2:28:05] and he has power over the clay
[2:28:12] let's just finish our this reading and
[2:28:14] we'll go to the next
[2:28:16] every spirit that confesses not
[2:28:19] that jesus christ is coming the flesh is
[2:28:22] not of god
[2:28:23] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[2:28:27] whereof you have heard that it should
[2:28:29] come
[2:28:30] and even now is already in the world
[2:28:33] let's jump over to the 17th verse
[2:28:36] because this is where god's taking us
[2:28:40] you understand he's trying to make us
[2:28:43] into something
[2:28:46] you understand that
[2:28:48] is that clear enough
[2:28:51] i don't care what brain battles you've
[2:28:54] been through
[2:28:55] i don't care what
[2:28:57] problems in life you've had
[2:28:59] all of it's in his hands
[2:29:02] and he can guide us out of them all
[2:29:06] many are the afflictions
[2:29:08] of the righteous
[2:29:09] but the lord delivereth us
[2:29:12] from them all
[2:29:16] he says herein is
[2:29:18] our love made perfect
[2:29:20] that we may have boldness in the day of
[2:29:23] judgment
[2:29:26] how many believe we're in the day of
[2:29:27] judgment
[2:29:33] we're having another toilet paper
[2:29:34] shortage
[2:29:37] they're rationing paper towels
[2:29:42] there's no end in sight
[2:29:47] gasoline is up to five dollars a gallon
[2:29:53] and they don't even know what's going to
[2:29:55] happen to heating
[2:30:02] we've got
[2:30:03] thousands and thousands hundreds of
[2:30:07] thousands of homeless people
[2:30:10] living on tents on the streets of our
[2:30:13] cities
[2:30:17] crime is everywhere
[2:30:21] they don't even arrest you for
[2:30:22] shoplifting
[2:30:26] you you understand that
[2:30:30] the lord spoke in his scripture that
[2:30:33] those that
[2:30:34] were servants or policemen or those in
[2:30:36] authority
[2:30:38] were to carry out
[2:30:40] the righteous and the wrath of god
[2:30:43] against the unrighteous
[2:30:46] so what's happening to this country
[2:30:50] they're abandoning god no okay we're not
[2:30:53] going we're not going to enforce that
[2:30:56] that punishment
[2:30:59] you can do all these minor misdemeanor
[2:31:01] things
[2:31:02] with no no punishment
[2:31:04] it may not be at your front door
[2:31:07] but it's coming
[2:31:10] pretty soon your car will be broken too
[2:31:14] and you'll call the police and they'll
[2:31:16] say we don't have enough of us would you
[2:31:18] please
[2:31:20] would you please fill out a form online
[2:31:25] and if the 3 000 officers we have just
[2:31:28] happened to run across that item in the
[2:31:32] 16 million people
[2:31:34] that
[2:31:35] we're policing we'll give you a place to
[2:31:37] pick it up
[2:31:41] it's the way it's getting
[2:31:45] i mean we might as well face it
[2:31:49] we're at the end of this thing
[2:31:52] no democracy has lasted
[2:31:55] 200 years
[2:31:58] we're bankrupt
[2:32:02] we are
[2:32:04] bankrupt
[2:32:06] we're going to print money
[2:32:10] we're going to tax everybody
[2:32:14] if you do a transaction over 600 dollars
[2:32:17] the government's going to check on you
[2:32:20] parents are standing up at school board
[2:32:22] meetings arguing about
[2:32:25] what the
[2:32:27] schools are teaching they should have a
[2:32:29] say
[2:32:30] the fbi is going to their houses yes
[2:32:33] to see if they're an insurrectionist
[2:32:37] i don't know how i've got away with it
[2:32:39] so long
[2:32:41] i'm just glad nobody listens to me
[2:32:46] no i'm serious
[2:32:55] it's just where we are
[2:32:57] and then
[2:32:58] if we
[2:33:04] i i had another
[2:33:06] a place that i
[2:33:09] i wanted to read that i thought was just
[2:33:11] so
[2:33:12] perfectly
[2:33:13] uh
[2:33:16] fit in but
[2:33:17] uh we'll just go on and close now
[2:33:20] because we're trying to make our point
[2:33:22] today
[2:33:23] is that
[2:33:25] the
[2:33:26] it's a it's a scripture in romans that
[2:33:28] says the potter have
[2:33:30] potter over the clay
[2:33:32] to make one unto honor and one to
[2:33:34] dishonor probably some of you guys with
[2:33:35] your phones can have that
[2:33:37] in a matter of
[2:33:39] of seconds but uh
[2:33:42] it's it's romans 9 21.
[2:33:45] it says
[2:33:46] now let's take this to heart for a
[2:33:48] moment
[2:33:49] hath not the potter power over the clay
[2:33:56] of the same lump to make one vessel unto
[2:34:00] honor
[2:34:01] and another
[2:34:02] unto dishonor
[2:34:04] what if god willing to show his wrath
[2:34:08] and to make his power known
[2:34:11] endureth with much longsuffering the
[2:34:14] vessels of wrath
[2:34:17] fitted to destruction
[2:34:20] and that he might make known
[2:34:23] the riches of his glory
[2:34:25] on the vessels of mercy
[2:34:27] which he had afford prepared unto glory
[2:34:35] we can't get out of the plan of god
[2:34:38] and he's not going to change his mind
[2:34:42] and whatever pathway
[2:34:45] when you settle that guide in your heart
[2:34:49] whichever way he leads you
[2:34:53] you're confident
[2:34:56] that what he leads you through
[2:34:59] is to the perfection
[2:35:03] of the vessel that he pre-prepared
[2:35:07] for honor
[2:35:09] so whatever place he's taking you
[2:35:11] whatever you're going through whatever
[2:35:15] you're suffering you never have to look
[2:35:17] like there's no hope
[2:35:19] i'm stuck with this thing you're stuck
[2:35:22] with whatever you're going through till
[2:35:24] the season of its accomplishment
[2:35:31] if it's the train of your faith
[2:35:35] let it work perfection
[2:35:38] be patient
[2:35:41] because he's not going to change
[2:35:44] he's going to guide you
[2:35:47] you we think well if he guided me i
[2:35:49] wouldn't go through this no he guides
[2:35:51] you through it
[2:35:52] because
[2:35:53] when he created that seed it took all of
[2:35:56] those things
[2:35:58] to put into that seed what it's going to
[2:36:00] become
[2:36:02] and what are we coming he says he's
[2:36:04] bringing us into that statue of a
[2:36:07] perfect man that that same spirit that
[2:36:10] dwelt in christ jesus would also dwell
[2:36:13] in us
[2:36:17] and if it quickened his mortal body
[2:36:21] it quickens
[2:36:22] our mortal body
[2:36:24] he learned obedience by what
[2:36:26] the things he suffered
[2:36:29] until he became fully obedient even unto
[2:36:33] the death of the cross
[2:36:36] so much so that he could say i have
[2:36:38] power to lay my life down and i have
[2:36:41] power to take it up again amen
[2:36:44] don't let satan beat you
[2:36:48] over the head that you have no faith to
[2:36:51] get well
[2:36:56] that would mean that you have your
[2:36:58] destiny
[2:36:59] in your own hands
[2:37:04] you can raise your hands and say lord
[2:37:06] help my
[2:37:08] unbelief
[2:37:11] lord i wouldn't have come this way
[2:37:14] there's no way that i've come that you
[2:37:17] didn't know
[2:37:19] you knew the beginning from the end you
[2:37:22] knew where you were taking me when i
[2:37:25] committed myself prophet of god said
[2:37:27] when you become a christian he says
[2:37:29] that's when the battles begin
[2:37:32] but we've got to come to this place we
[2:37:34] need a guide we're in the darkest mess
[2:37:37] we've ever been in and god sent us one
[2:37:44] it was the spirit of the lord jesus
[2:37:46] christ
[2:37:49] it was none other than the same spirit
[2:37:52] that dwelt in jesus christ
[2:37:54] but he veiled himself
[2:37:57] in a messenger
[2:37:59] in some
[2:38:01] physical form
[2:38:03] so that he could
[2:38:05] speak to us
[2:38:08] show us vindicate to us
[2:38:11] prove to us beyond of a shallow doubt
[2:38:14] i'm the guide
[2:38:17] i've been there
[2:38:20] i've lost a wife
[2:38:23] i've lost a child
[2:38:25] i was tormented
[2:38:27] i was going to blow a boy's brain that's
[2:38:29] out
[2:38:31] i was going to do this
[2:38:34] and do that
[2:38:36] but one day up on the hill
[2:38:39] i heard that old cowboy
[2:38:41] plane
[2:38:43] the old rugged cross
[2:38:46] and i heard the voice blow through the
[2:38:48] trees going adam where art down
[2:38:53] oh yeah
[2:38:55] and then he went back
[2:38:58] and the angel of the lord came to him
[2:39:01] and told him what he would do
[2:39:05] and he let his mother-in-law
[2:39:08] for his wife sake talk out of it
[2:39:13] you don't think he paid the price to
[2:39:15] know what it meant
[2:39:16] to stay with god's word
[2:39:18] we're not best based on whims
[2:39:21] we're based on raw reality and the raw
[2:39:25] reality is
[2:39:27] we shouldn't take another step
[2:39:30] until we get aligned with this guide
[2:39:32] because god is not going to change his
[2:39:35] mind about his word for nothing he's not
[2:39:39] going to change his mind about you
[2:39:42] he's going to do whatever he needs to do
[2:39:44] to get you in line he's going to do
[2:39:46] whatever he needs to know he puts your
[2:39:49] name in the book and he's going to get
[2:39:51] you to be the person whose name is in
[2:39:54] that book
[2:39:58] that character
[2:39:59] that we'll take with us
[2:40:01] we took nothing into this world
[2:40:04] we'll take nothing else out but our
[2:40:06] character
[2:40:08] and that character is going to be in
[2:40:10] christ i counsel thee to buy of me gold
[2:40:12] tried in fire
[2:40:14] i counsel thee to buy white raiment
[2:40:18] to cover thy nakedness
[2:40:21] he counseled us
[2:40:24] he's counseling us this morning
[2:40:29] let's clean out
[2:40:32] the thoughts of the world he knows what
[2:40:35] we have need of before we ask let's
[2:40:38] center our lives on his leadership
[2:40:41] and all else
[2:40:43] will be provided
[2:40:45] he'll take care of everything else this
[2:40:47] evening i hope you come back i hope
[2:40:49] you're not working today i hope you're
[2:40:52] not too busy today
[2:40:54] but if you can come back we'll listen to
[2:40:57] the rest of this
[2:40:59] tape
[2:41:01] this evening
[2:41:02] and i i just trusted bless you i
[2:41:05] encourage you
[2:41:07] to listen
[2:41:08] to the message of the hour
[2:41:11] i i i i'm imploring you this morning to
[2:41:15] form your own personal relationship
[2:41:19] with your guide
[2:41:23] it'll bring everything together in your
[2:41:25] life
[2:41:26] in perfect harmony
[2:41:28] because he's not going to lead you
[2:41:30] trials
[2:41:31] you go through trials
[2:41:35] like he said you want to hunt goats you
[2:41:37] got to climb the rocks
[2:41:42] you want to fly fish high mountain
[2:41:45] streams you got to take the trails into
[2:41:48] the streams
[2:41:49] you've got to go the way that leads you
[2:41:51] there
[2:41:52] and you have to have a guide to lead you
[2:41:55] and he knows where he's taking you he
[2:41:58] knows what he's making he knows what
[2:42:00] he's building he knows what you have
[2:42:02] need of even before you ask
[2:42:05] all you have to do is
[2:42:07] have confidence in your guide and he'll
[2:42:10] get you all the way there god bless you
[2:42:12] let's stand this morning
[2:42:26] i'm glad god didn't give up on me
[2:42:30] i'm glad with all my heart that
[2:42:33] he saw something in me that i didn't see
[2:42:36] that he put something in me
[2:42:39] i would have never seen myself in this
[2:42:41] pulpit i'd never want to be here
[2:42:45] i don't understand it
[2:42:48] but i can't use my weaknesses as an
[2:42:50] excuse and i can't use
[2:42:52] my abilities
[2:42:54] so i'm stuck with one thing right yes my
[2:42:57] grace is sufficient for you
[2:43:00] amen
[2:43:01] i'm stuck with one thing lord okay
[2:43:05] i'm in a lot of places i shouldn't be
[2:43:08] i have a lot of thoughts i don't want to
[2:43:10] have
[2:43:11] i have a lot of feelings
[2:43:15] but they're there for my good
[2:43:18] and i believe you can take me
[2:43:21] i'm going to commit myself to this word
[2:43:25] actually evidence of the holy spirit
[2:43:28] is following that guide
[2:43:31] following that word and i trust it's
[2:43:33] going to lead me
[2:43:36] because i i'm confident lord that you're
[2:43:39] taking me someplace
[2:43:44] and i'm not going to complain anymore
[2:43:46] about
[2:43:47] hard days and
[2:43:55] the things that
[2:43:58] i don't think might be right
[2:44:02] i'm not going to complain father about
[2:44:04] the criticisms and those things
[2:44:08] i'm going to believe that i'm in the
[2:44:10] palm of your hand
[2:44:12] and nothing can pluck me out
[2:44:15] i'm going to believe that you're the
[2:44:17] potter
[2:44:18] and i'm the clay and
[2:44:21] you're the one that
[2:44:24] is shaping me into what that it is that
[2:44:28] you wanted my vessel
[2:44:31] to be
[2:44:34] father i realize that
[2:44:37] every vessel in here
[2:44:40] is in your hands
[2:44:44] and you're molding every life in here
[2:44:49] and lord you're standing here this
[2:44:51] morning offering yourself
[2:44:55] to each person
[2:44:59] you're saying let me guide you
[2:45:02] let me lead you
[2:45:04] away from your dark past
[2:45:09] let me take the guilt
[2:45:11] and the shame away
[2:45:16] will you believe me when
[2:45:18] i tell you that
[2:45:20] you're forgiven
[2:45:23] that when i was on calvary
[2:45:27] and they drove those nails into my hand
[2:45:32] i was doing that for you
[2:45:38] when they scourged me
[2:45:44] i was doing it for every sick person
[2:45:56] when i was in despair
[2:46:03] and i cried out
[2:46:06] father
[2:46:08] let this cup pass me
[2:46:13] but i said nevertheless
[2:46:16] thy will
[2:46:17] be done
[2:46:22] and i took captive
[2:46:24] captive
[2:46:27] and i've set my people free
[2:46:32] this morning if
[2:46:34] you may believe the message i'm not
[2:46:36] doubting that
[2:46:41] but it's
[2:46:43] time not to just know there is a guide
[2:46:48] and there's a time that you're just not
[2:46:51] following in
[2:46:52] in the crowd
[2:46:55] but there comes a time where it's got to
[2:46:57] be you making your decision
[2:47:00] then i'm going to make it to heaven
[2:47:04] i can see this world is crumbling around
[2:47:07] me
[2:47:10] and i want to
[2:47:11] align myself with the only person
[2:47:18] the only message
[2:47:22] that can take me out of this dark
[2:47:24] wilderness
[2:47:31] i'm going to make a
[2:47:35] vow in my heart
[2:47:37] to myself
[2:47:42] that i'm going to bring this leadership
[2:47:44] into my
[2:47:46] life as much as i like music and i like
[2:47:50] the beat and i like the song
[2:47:52] and i like the style and i like the way
[2:47:55] that it makes me feel
[2:47:59] i know that that's just taking me deeper
[2:48:01] into darkness
[2:48:04] though i like the personalities of my
[2:48:07] friends and the way they make me feel
[2:48:09] and
[2:48:11] the sensations that unbelieving boy
[2:48:13] brings
[2:48:17] i'm going to bring my body under
[2:48:19] subjection
[2:48:24] i'm not going to be led
[2:48:27] by any other spirit
[2:48:32] because they're guiding me
[2:48:35] and they're guiding me somewhere
[2:48:38] and they're guiding me deeper and deeper
[2:48:40] to a place that i can't find myself
[2:48:43] out of
[2:48:46] the lord you're offering me a guide this
[2:48:48] morning
[2:48:53] you're offering me someone that knows
[2:48:55] what lies ahead
[2:48:58] and will show me things to come

[2:49:28] you know each heart
[2:49:31] and i'm trusting this morning father you
[2:49:33] will come by
[2:49:35] and you will guide each heart
[2:49:38] that you'll touch each heart and tell
[2:49:40] them i'm here for you
[2:49:42] i'm here to guide you
