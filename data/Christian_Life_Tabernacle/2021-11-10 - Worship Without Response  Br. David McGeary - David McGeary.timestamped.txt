[5:11] and trust that they're a blessing
[5:14] to you let's turn in our bibles to
[5:16] matthew
[5:18] the seventh chapter
[5:20] and
[5:22] the seventh verse so
[5:24] um
[5:25] we don't know how many is
[5:27] uh
[5:30] watching in tonight or connected up i
[5:33] i know we usually have
[5:35] a 30 or 40 sometimes more
[5:38] but we certainly like to see all those
[5:41] people materialize
[5:44] i think
[5:46] brother billy preached to us
[5:48] tonight
[5:49] last wednesday about it becoming
[5:52] material
[5:54] you know i'd like to see the church
[5:56] materialize
[5:58] i some of them i i believe they're still
[6:00] there i haven't seen them for several
[6:02] years but
[6:04] i think that we're trusting that as many
[6:07] could come out as we can
[6:09] friday night we're really looking
[6:11] forward to brother
[6:13] uh
[6:14] burly williams coming and sharing with
[6:16] what's on his heart with us
[6:18] and then brother tom ray and just have
[6:21] uh kind of go back and get our meetings
[6:24] started again
[6:25] we didn't go outside to invite a lot of
[6:28] people in but
[6:29] we hope that you can come
[6:32] with
[6:33] your friends if any of them would
[6:35] respond or all of our family can come
[6:38] out together and grow on the lord let's
[6:40] listen to the seventh verse here
[6:43] as we just
[6:44] read this and
[6:47] i'm sure you'll be able to
[6:50] derive very quickly
[6:54] where our heart is going
[6:56] ask
[6:58] and it shall be given you seek
[7:03] and ye shall find knock
[7:06] and it shall be opened unto you
[7:10] for every
[7:11] one that asketh receiveth
[7:15] now this is the lord speaking
[7:17] so how how
[7:19] how much value
[7:21] does that statement have to you
[7:24] if he said so
[7:26] if i said so you might wonder if i'm
[7:28] kidding or you know what i'm getting at
[7:31] and all this
[7:32] but when he speaks
[7:35] that's gold
[7:36] that's solid rock
[7:39] so i mean
[7:40] he says
[7:41] and it shall be open to you for everyone
[7:44] that asketh receive it
[7:47] and he that seeketh find it
[7:50] and to him that knock that it shall
[7:54] be opened
[7:56] now he he makes those great promises now
[7:59] he he's now he wants to put it in
[8:02] perspective
[8:03] to you
[8:04] so you can take what he just said
[8:08] and consider it in the light that he's
[8:11] speaking it
[8:13] so he wants to give you a little
[8:15] confirmation
[8:16] even from your own selves
[8:18] to so that this statement gains so much
[8:22] more weight
[8:24] it
[8:24] says
[8:26] or what man
[8:29] is there of you
[8:32] whom if his son asked bread
[8:37] he will give him a stone
[8:41] or if he asks a fish
[8:45] will give him
[8:47] a serpent
[8:49] if he then being evil
[8:53] know how to give
[8:55] good
[8:56] gifts
[8:57] unto your children
[8:59] how much more shall your father
[9:03] which is in heaven
[9:05] give good things to them
[9:08] that ask him
[9:11] wherefore all things
[9:14] whatsoever ye would
[9:16] that men shall do to you
[9:18] do even so to them
[9:21] for this is the law
[9:23] and the prophets father bless your word
[9:26] in your precious name we pray amen you
[9:29] may be seated
[9:36] uh i think those these are great
[9:38] scriptures
[9:39] uh
[9:40] in going uh
[9:42] into our services
[9:45] and you know one thing about the great
[9:48] things and the great blessings of god
[9:50] it's like a cup
[9:52] you know that it overflows
[9:55] and when you get blessed and and you're
[9:57] blessed and god's working for you
[10:00] and and you're seeing god moves it's not
[10:02] long that that just overflows
[10:05] you know what i mean and then you're
[10:07] sharing your blessing you're sharing
[10:08] your testimony
[10:10] i like this scripture and its approach
[10:14] uh
[10:15] because the lord ties it into
[10:18] whatsoever thing that you would have men
[10:21] do to you
[10:22] you do to them
[10:24] and he's he's putting he he's talking
[10:26] about the father in heaven
[10:29] and there's one thing that we know about
[10:32] the lord
[10:33] is that he practices what he preaches
[10:37] you you can you can confident and i love
[10:41] how all the brothers have been
[10:44] going going
[10:45] through the word and
[10:47] trying to bring us to the place that we
[10:50] build our confidence
[10:53] in the word of god
[10:55] build our confidence in the things that
[10:58] god says
[10:59] and to have the scriptures and the word
[11:02] of god become the guiding principles by
[11:06] which we achieve things
[11:08] you can achieve things by man and that
[11:11] gives glory unto man
[11:13] how many times have uh i've heard the
[11:16] testimony from believers they've taken
[11:19] jobs that were really over their head or
[11:22] beyond their
[11:24] educational degree or
[11:27] they they went ahead and took
[11:29] responsibilities that they have never
[11:32] had before and they were willing to step
[11:35] out into those areas because they
[11:39] trusted in the grace of god
[11:42] and and that's how that we want to go
[11:44] forward we don't want to achieve and
[11:47] accomplish without
[11:49] uh the lord being in it and if god be in
[11:53] it and god be with us and god be for us
[11:57] then he can do all things
[12:00] all things are possible uh we we have
[12:03] we've got that
[12:05] understanding in our heart the
[12:07] understanding as the our messenger
[12:09] called it the uh
[12:12] the vision
[12:15] the the vision of the opportunity
[12:18] that a lie
[12:20] that
[12:21] lies there for us that it's possible
[12:25] with god
[12:27] you know the possibility is there as
[12:30] long as he's with me
[12:33] i can do it
[12:35] amen that's the one trust i have is the
[12:39] possibility so we're talking about going
[12:43] in
[12:44] to
[12:45] these uh meetings and
[12:48] and
[12:49] we want to go into a meeting or you want
[12:51] to go into anything
[12:54] understanding that
[12:57] god as a father
[13:00] and
[13:01] that's a
[13:03] that's a good question
[13:05] you know do we really look at
[13:07] god as a father
[13:10] you know our father we look at him as
[13:12] the creator
[13:13] we look at him as
[13:16] one that
[13:19] you know can do whatever he wants and
[13:21] that we need to be in in fear of him but
[13:24] i don't know if that's just the fear
[13:26] like a fear of wrath or just a fear of
[13:30] respect and and honor you know that that
[13:33] you want to do but the father also knows
[13:36] that you want to do
[13:40] his will
[13:43] and and i i don't think that you would
[13:45] be here tonight if there wasn't either a
[13:47] conviction working in you or
[13:51] a love working in you or something in
[13:53] you that you knew there was a god and
[13:57] you hungered
[13:58] for
[13:59] the lord and jesus now of course you
[14:03] know in his ministry
[14:06] he's now bringing to the church an
[14:09] exodus
[14:10] and we know an exodus is coming out of
[14:14] one thing and moving into another
[14:17] he's he's he's now he's preaching the
[14:20] gospel
[14:21] to the jews and
[14:23] uh
[14:24] we all of these scriptures we all put
[14:27] believe are all part of the great sermon
[14:30] on the mount when he was
[14:32] preaching in the crossroads of trade up
[14:35] there on this southern part of the sea
[14:38] of galilee and and so he's talking to
[14:41] him in an exodus
[14:42] exodus and he's trying to change the
[14:46] relationship
[14:48] that they have with god as a god of far
[14:52] off to a god that's going to dwell with
[14:56] him
[14:57] what what a what a gospel understand the
[15:00] gospel that jesus is preaching is tr is
[15:04] is revealing to his children that god
[15:09] has an attitude towards them that's
[15:12] different than they perceived
[15:15] remember by law
[15:17] that's what they lived under and now
[15:20] he's preaching to them the exodus of
[15:23] moving from one spiritual way of worship
[15:27] from one spiritual mindset
[15:30] from one approach
[15:33] to a new approach
[15:35] and in order for them to approach god in
[15:39] a new light in a new spirit and a new
[15:43] understanding they need to understand
[15:46] some things about the god that they
[15:48] serve
[15:50] and now he's they're not just serving
[15:52] him as a god is afar off but jesus if i
[15:56] could
[15:57] use this word if it would be all right
[16:00] jesus is
[16:02] thankfully
[16:03] he is
[16:06] humanizing god
[16:12] you know what i mean he's wanting you
[16:15] to understand that god is now
[16:19] creating a union with your thinking and
[16:23] his thinking
[16:24] which one of you being evil
[16:31] you know and and that's what the jews
[16:33] realized right we're evil we're sinners
[16:36] we need the law to keep us we've got to
[16:38] stay away from everything that's unclean
[16:42] you know and we don't really ask god
[16:45] the only time we cry out from god cry
[16:48] out to god is when we've broken his law
[16:52] or we've moved away from them or we
[16:54] haven't been doing the commandments that
[16:57] we were told to be commanded and
[17:00] therefore we cry out to god now he's
[17:03] bringing to him a completely whole new
[17:06] different relationship how many of you
[17:09] feel that the lord lately through the
[17:11] ministering of his word and his spirit
[17:14] is trying to bring us into a new
[17:16] relationship with him
[17:20] amen
[17:22] something where where we're able to
[17:24] stand up and accept what he's given to
[17:27] us
[17:28] and what he's done that what he's done
[17:30] for us and we're words we're we're as i
[17:34] preached here a little while back we're
[17:36] accepting the responsibility
[17:39] of our election
[17:41] uh we're thankful for it we're grateful
[17:43] for it we're we're gonna and we're not
[17:45] gonna deny what he did
[17:48] okay he he he chose me i'm not gonna
[17:51] deny it he forgave me of my sins i'm not
[17:54] gonna deny it he he was merciful and
[17:57] kind to me i'm not gonna die deny it i'm
[18:00] going to accept it and i'm going to now
[18:02] walk in the responsibility
[18:04] of my appreciation
[18:07] of what he's done for me
[18:09] i am going to be more careful
[18:12] of my testimony
[18:15] i i'm going to become more careful of
[18:18] the light that i'm shining i'm going to
[18:21] be more careful of what what atmosphere
[18:25] it is that i'm testifying too
[18:28] and i'm not going to get all bummed out
[18:30] at the boss because that's not who's in
[18:33] charge of me
[18:35] i'm not going to get mad at the pastor
[18:41] oh that's okay i
[18:44] i threw that in there
[18:46] no i don't think anybody's mad at me i
[18:48] hope everybody that's not here is not
[18:50] mad at me
[18:52] then i have a lot of repenting and work
[18:54] to do because i'm sure you've got a just
[18:56] cause
[18:58] so you understand so now he's going in
[19:00] here and he's saying which one of you
[19:02] now i want you to think for a moment
[19:04] he's introducing to us
[19:07] the thoughts of god
[19:10] jesus is not in this exodus
[19:13] there's two things that are going on
[19:15] he's changing the relationship
[19:18] he's making god human why is he making
[19:20] god human
[19:22] because god is now human
[19:26] right he's walking in flesh
[19:29] diverse manners he did these things but
[19:31] now in his son
[19:34] he's doing these things so now he's he's
[19:37] there he's he's he's
[19:39] i love this terminology it means a lot
[19:41] to my heart he's present tense
[19:44] he who have seen me have seen the father
[19:48] so he's now he's getting very intimate
[19:50] and he's showing to him and he's
[19:52] bringing them to an exodus to a new a
[19:56] new
[19:57] a new understanding of the father a new
[19:59] relationship and he's making inhuman and
[20:02] he say use your own thoughts he says
[20:05] which one of you
[20:08] you know he says
[20:09] if then
[20:11] being evil
[20:14] know how to give good gifts
[20:16] unto your children how much more shall
[20:19] your father which is in heaven give good
[20:23] things to them that ask him
[20:27] and you know i thought of a a a title or
[20:31] a thought of or what it was that i was
[20:37] wanting to express and i just came up
[20:39] with a little thought
[20:41] you know worship without response
[20:46] to worship without response
[20:48] and and before it just seemed like they
[20:51] were just worshipping
[20:53] oh wow you know he's god he's the only
[20:56] true god it's worshiping it that
[20:59] worshipping
[21:01] and uh
[21:03] but there there was never
[21:05] a desire
[21:08] for a response
[21:12] you know what i mean it's like you you
[21:14] know it it's
[21:16] and he's he's starting to tell him now
[21:19] it's not just you saying i love you or i
[21:22] adore you or you're the almighty your
[21:26] god
[21:27] uh your
[21:29] oh i could get so excited right now
[21:31] buddy
[21:33] no i'm gonna close it keep my
[21:35] things in because
[21:37] but it's not it's it's it's not just you
[21:41] can you just picture it they're burning
[21:43] lambs and they're
[21:44] they're doing all these things and it's
[21:47] all adoration and everything but there's
[21:50] no response but but there couldn't be a
[21:53] response but now that there's an
[21:55] offering made and a sacrifice being made
[21:58] and the real lamb has come down to take
[22:02] away our sins now he has put himself in
[22:06] a position where he can respond
[22:12] so now it's not anymore
[22:16] but keeping the law
[22:18] keep yourself clean keep your thing
[22:21] separating out of people but now
[22:24] the relationship is changing and now he
[22:27] wants to respond
[22:30] to worship
[22:36] now his response
[22:38] is not going to be
[22:41] i got a like this is a tight line i'm
[22:45] going to try to walk here
[22:47] but
[22:48] his response is not
[22:52] only his intervention in his life
[22:56] in your life when you don't know it
[23:00] he doesn't want it to be a response like
[23:04] a puppet
[23:06] you know i'm going to pull this string
[23:07] in your life and i'm going to pull this
[23:09] string in your life
[23:11] and without us having any relationship
[23:15] at all i'm just going to guide your
[23:17] steps and
[23:19] part of that is true the footsteps of
[23:23] the righteous
[23:24] are ordered by the lord and that's what
[23:27] we know that grace is
[23:29] grace is divine intervention
[23:33] in our lives
[23:34] that that comes from the throne of god
[23:39] in other words god makes a decision
[23:42] to intervene in our life
[23:45] on our behalf
[23:48] for our betterment that's grace mercy is
[23:52] god deciding not to carry out the
[23:55] judgment that you deserve
[23:58] but to
[23:59] to
[24:00] uh
[24:02] to
[24:03] uh
[24:04] wipe your slate clean and to absorb what
[24:08] you justly deserve and and take it
[24:11] within his own judgment
[24:13] and and so the relationship is not just
[24:18] a relationship from him
[24:20] intervening but now he invites you into
[24:23] the relationship
[24:25] to ask for a response ask anything
[24:34] that that's that that's a
[24:37] that's a new thing we realize now
[24:41] that he has kept us by what
[24:44] grace
[24:45] and by mercy that all
[24:48] along the way
[24:50] he has been intervening he has been
[24:53] protecting us and keeping us in
[24:56] everything so he's done those things but
[24:59] now the relationship is it's almost like
[25:03] that's
[25:04] that's how he courted us
[25:07] but now it's becomes a union
[25:11] and he's he's he's he's telling us
[25:15] that
[25:16] i will respond
[25:21] i will respond it's not worship without
[25:24] response you've loved me you've served
[25:26] me you've accepted my mercies you've
[25:29] accepted my grace you've accepted my
[25:32] word now i'm sitting here telling you
[25:34] ask me
[25:38] and i'll i will give you
[25:40] the desire of your heart seek me
[25:43] and you'll find me so so
[25:46] just to
[25:47] take this beautiful
[25:49] a thought about this uh
[25:52] book the exodus that they're going
[25:54] through and the change of their
[25:57] relationship
[25:58] and that god's now wanting to enter into
[26:02] a relationship
[26:03] of response
[26:06] he wants to respond
[26:09] to your heart's desire
[26:14] oh that's
[26:16] the first thing that you go to right is
[26:18] all your dirty sins that keep you from
[26:20] asking
[26:23] you're not worthy you're not
[26:25] that he's trying to bring you past that
[26:30] you know
[26:33] you know
[26:34] if if you're dirty ass for soap and
[26:36] water
[26:39] hallelujah
[26:41] you got a habit you want the liver ask
[26:43] for deliverance this is what he's saying
[26:47] i'm not going to give you a stone
[26:54] you know
[26:55] i i will respond to you what a beautiful
[26:58] god that you you understand you
[27:01] understand
[27:02] in my heart
[27:04] just bubbling over is that
[27:07] he he's brought he's he condensanted he
[27:10] he came from being god to uh to a man
[27:14] that we could handle them and touch them
[27:16] and feel them and experience it and have
[27:18] a relationship with them so now he's
[27:21] saying i was up there and you worshiped
[27:23] me afar off and with your your your lips
[27:27] you did worship me but your hearts were
[27:29] apart from me but now i've come down i
[27:32] become one of you i'm in your form and
[27:35] now i'm humanizing myself and telling
[27:38] you i because i've cleansed you
[27:42] i'm willing to have a relationship with
[27:44] you on your level
[27:51] i like that
[27:56] i i i'm having a lot of fellowship and
[28:00] and and uh
[28:02] you know i enjoy giving brother tommy a
[28:04] hard time so
[28:06] uh
[28:07] he we got to talking about the scripture
[28:10] you know
[28:11] in in first sean in the beginning was
[28:13] the word you know and everything that
[28:15] was made by made by him and he was
[28:17] talking about how
[28:18] you know and i said well tommy you're
[28:20] just trying to figure out god
[28:25] you know
[28:26] and the scriptures are so phenomenal
[28:30] when you sit down and read those first
[28:32] four scriptures it's just
[28:34] you know it just it just the expanse of
[28:37] it is just
[28:38] pretty soon you just you know you're
[28:40] lost because he put it within you that
[28:42] you can't but the beginning of the end
[28:45] so there's this great god
[28:48] and now he's coming down where he's
[28:50] going to deal with
[28:51] your thoughts
[28:55] the way you think
[28:56] the way you perceive
[29:00] the way you hurt
[29:03] the way you
[29:05] take emotions
[29:07] and the way you take input
[29:10] and everything about that you are he is
[29:14] now
[29:15] becoming
[29:17] so he's became you you've heard this
[29:20] statement right that we might become
[29:23] him
[29:25] that we might be conformed into the
[29:28] image of his son so we're going into
[29:31] this meeting
[29:32] and we don't want to approach this
[29:34] meeting with the attitude of i'm going
[29:38] to wait and see what happens
[29:43] i'm going to come into this meeting and
[29:45] i'm going to make something happen
[29:49] because i am going to ask
[29:52] [Music]
[29:55] and because i ask
[29:59] and he's already placed himself
[30:04] in the position of a responder
[30:10] a lot of talk about first responder
[30:13] i'd like to maybe preach a message
[30:15] called the first first responder
[30:20] have i already preached that
[30:25] you understand
[30:26] you understand now he's responding
[30:29] this is where he wants the relationship
[30:32] he doesn't want worship without
[30:35] response
[30:38] him
[30:39] you are this is his attitude yes this is
[30:43] his thoughts
[30:44] this is
[30:45] what he is trying to reveal to us as is
[30:48] i'm not the kind of god that you just
[30:51] sit there and worship me and worship me
[30:53] and worship me and i don't respond to
[30:56] you i want you to know me i want you to
[30:59] know the kind of god that i am i want
[31:02] you to know the love that i have for you
[31:05] god so loved the world that he responded
[31:08] with his only begotten son so he's not
[31:11] he's he's trying to change the dynamics
[31:17] we're now he's in our lives
[31:21] responding
[31:23] it's not worship without response
[31:29] let's just do a quick bible study
[31:33] you like the word
[31:35] let's turn over to jeremiah
[31:53] and we're going to go to jeremiah
[31:55] the 29th chapter
[31:59] and
[32:00] we're going to start with the ninth
[32:03] verse
[32:11] you you'll see as we read this why our
[32:14] messengers so much begin to talk they
[32:16] say the days of miracles are passed
[32:20] so what they're saying the day of
[32:22] response
[32:24] is past
[32:27] the day of god responding to your hearts
[32:30] and your needs
[32:34] what happens if we we you know
[32:36] uh
[32:38] if you look at the love that a mother
[32:41] has for her child
[32:43] and how she responds
[32:46] to that child's needs
[32:49] you know and a real mother and how she
[32:52] responds to that child's needs and now
[32:55] god's sitting back and saying that
[32:57] that's even one of my attributes
[33:00] i'm here to respond
[33:04] thank you lord
[33:06] i mean
[33:08] what a relationship but so this is what
[33:11] he he said let's go through this for a
[33:13] moment if you
[33:15] don't mind bearing with me
[33:17] in my folly
[33:19] it says for they prophesy falsely unto
[33:23] you in my name
[33:25] i have not sent them saith the lord
[33:29] so if they're prophesying falsely is
[33:32] they're not
[33:33] telling the people
[33:35] what he really is remember that was one
[33:39] of jesus's first complaints
[33:42] they they you keep you wash pots
[33:45] you wash pans you do this you do all
[33:48] these things you know what i mean and my
[33:50] father's not in it
[33:54] so as we read
[33:56] he says
[33:58] for thus saith the lord
[34:01] that after 70 years
[34:04] now this is to the jews
[34:06] but this is also
[34:08] to me if i let me just say to me a type
[34:11] of the seven church agents
[34:15] so after after a period of time
[34:19] i'm going to i am now going to enter
[34:22] into a relationship
[34:25] with you
[34:27] and the relationship is what responds
[34:32] so the law
[34:35] is
[34:36] a form of captivity
[34:42] well that's what the law is right you
[34:44] can't do what you want to do
[34:46] okay but when you're born again you do
[34:48] exactly what you want to do the trouble
[34:51] you have is with the things you don't
[34:53] want to do
[34:55] just the opposite
[34:56] okay so he says here beautiful i love it
[35:00] he said
[35:02] accomplished at babylon what's babylon
[35:06] that's that's the catholic church it's a
[35:09] denominational spirit it's a great
[35:12] harlot
[35:13] it's everybody that's spewing out all
[35:15] this religious stuff and if that's false
[35:19] and these lies and
[35:21] contrary to the word this whole
[35:23] religious
[35:24] uh
[35:26] apostasy
[35:28] that we're in is beautifully typed here
[35:31] he said
[35:33] after after years after the seven church
[35:36] ages are accomplished
[35:38] in
[35:39] uh the nickelodeon seven church ages
[35:42] accomplished in babylon under the great
[35:45] harlot
[35:46] praise god
[35:48] that's you won't find that in your bible
[35:52] so if i lost you don't start turning
[35:54] pages
[35:55] i i'm just letting you how i read some
[35:58] of these things because prophet of god
[36:00] said take the word of god and bring it
[36:02] to your age
[36:04] put your name in it put yourself in the
[36:06] situation right i we've come out we're
[36:09] in a very dark time where they're
[36:11] robbing us of all our rights and
[36:13] everything and they've been doing it for
[36:16] a long time now
[36:18] you see we all of a sudden we're going
[36:20] whoa where are we
[36:22] prophet of god told us in 56 that they
[36:25] made the choice
[36:29] he said
[36:31] and i will visit you and perform my
[36:35] good word towards you
[36:40] in causing you to return to this place
[36:44] now
[36:45] where is it that we want to return to
[36:49] we want to return to eden
[36:54] okay but he's going to cause us to
[36:57] return to this place so there's going to
[37:00] be an exodus
[37:02] where we're coming out of one place and
[37:05] moving into another relationship
[37:09] now and now this relationship is a
[37:11] relationship of not worship without
[37:14] response so
[37:16] we where now he is placing himself self
[37:21] into your lives
[37:24] he is placing himself into the
[37:27] relationship
[37:28] and he's revealing himself to you
[37:32] and how he's going to deal with you how
[37:35] am i going to deal with you ask
[37:42] i'll respond
[37:45] i'll give you an answer
[37:47] you shall
[37:48] receive another if you're asking
[37:51] something that's not good for you he's
[37:53] not going to withhold himself
[37:57] i wish i had that scripture on my mind i
[37:59] know it but i can't
[38:01] recall it my recall is not like it used
[38:04] to be
[38:06] so but that's what he said
[38:09] so
[38:09] he he's not going to withhold it
[38:12] he's going to tell you no that's not bad
[38:15] i got something better for you
[38:18] in other words
[38:19] don't create
[38:21] your own response
[38:24] and then judge your relationship on
[38:27] whether or not
[38:34] a girl told me one time
[38:38] the person she was seeing
[38:41] asked her to marry her and i said what
[38:43] did you say and her answer to me was he
[38:46] didn't give me a big enough diamond
[38:55] of course i went and bought leslie a
[38:56] bigger one
[39:00] but
[39:01] what a response
[39:04] she already had the weight that she was
[39:06] going to measure
[39:10] so we don't want we we just want to know
[39:14] that this is not a relationship without
[39:16] response it's not worship without
[39:19] response
[39:21] and so
[39:22] that as we're we're just looking at this
[39:24] type here as we're just running it
[39:26] through the scriptures just to enjoy
[39:28] god's word because we're wanting to go
[39:31] into the meeting
[39:33] knowing that we're not going in this
[39:35] meeting to worship him
[39:38] and that he doesn't have a response for
[39:41] us
[39:45] we want to go in this meeting knowing
[39:48] that he's
[39:50] inviting you
[39:52] to lay your request down
[39:54] how many loves the story of esther
[39:58] esther comes in right
[40:00] and it was certain death to walk in the
[40:03] presence of the king she walked in there
[40:05] every sword went up and he put his king
[40:07] out
[40:08] his rod out there she was beautiful
[40:12] serving him
[40:14] and he says what would you like me to do
[40:17] up to half of my kingdom hallelujah
[40:24] what did he say
[40:25] little flock it's the father's good
[40:28] pleasure to what give
[40:30] you
[40:31] the kingdom how many's asked for any of
[40:34] the kingdoms
[40:41] all kinds of stuff in the kingdom
[40:45] that would be a sermon when itself
[40:47] wouldn't maybe one day you take that
[40:48] preach on all the stuff that's in the
[40:50] kingdom you can handle it
[40:53] take you about 50 years but that's all
[40:55] right it'll be a lifetime ministry
[41:00] he says
[41:01] for i know the thoughts that i think
[41:05] towards you
[41:06] saith the lord
[41:08] thoughts of peace
[41:11] and not of evil
[41:12] to give you
[41:14] an expected
[41:16] end
[41:18] and i believe in and you you know i feel
[41:21] this and i've expressed it to you before
[41:23] that satan works real hard to get you
[41:26] into an adversarial relationship with
[41:29] god
[41:31] that god's always wanting to beat you
[41:34] well that's what the law was
[41:36] it was the law of punishment
[41:39] of condemnation
[41:42] but now he's wanting to lift the
[41:43] condemnation so we just read through and
[41:46] just have a good time in
[41:48] god's word
[41:51] he says then shall ye call
[41:54] upon me
[41:56] and ye shall
[41:58] go and pray un to me
[42:01] and i
[42:02] will hearken
[42:04] unto you
[42:06] so here he's talking in type in the old
[42:09] testament
[42:10] and here he responds
[42:13] and as the lord healing their sick
[42:16] giving their hearts desire answering
[42:18] rabbi rabbi
[42:20] you know
[42:21] help me here help me there and he's
[42:24] showing and he's preaching god is a god
[42:26] that responds he's not far off he's not
[42:30] the punished he's a deliverer and a
[42:32] lover and a
[42:34] and a great host so now we look at this
[42:36] type and it falls right down into our
[42:39] age and it's the same
[42:42] answer
[42:44] after deliverance i respond
[42:50] i'm a god now that's going to respond to
[42:52] you
[42:56] when you come back to this place
[43:00] out of captivity
[43:02] our relationship is going to be
[43:05] you ask
[43:06] i'll answer
[43:11] he wants to
[43:16] by not asking you're turning away his
[43:19] affections
[43:22] you're turning away his response
[43:27] just think
[43:29] he said they prophesied falsely
[43:31] just think that people that preach that
[43:34] there's no miracles
[43:36] there's no works
[43:38] there's no supernatural
[43:40] intervention
[43:43] they've
[43:44] it's a one-sided relationship and no
[43:47] wonder he said that with their lips they
[43:49] do worship me but their hearts are far
[43:52] from me
[43:53] look as we read let's just read these
[43:55] few scriptures it's beautiful
[43:58] i will hearken unto me and ye shall seek
[44:01] me
[44:03] and find me
[44:05] and when ye shall search for me with all
[44:08] of your heart
[44:09] and i will be found of you
[44:12] saith the lord
[44:14] and i will turn away your captivity
[44:18] and i will gather you
[44:21] from the nations and from all the places
[44:24] we're in
[44:25] i have driven you saith the lord and i
[44:28] will bring you again unto the place
[44:31] whence i caused you to be carried away
[44:34] from in captivity
[44:37] isn't that just exactly the type of the
[44:40] church ages of us dropping out from
[44:43] where we were in this hickey of time
[44:45] that he could manifest we go through the
[44:47] church ages and now here he is in the
[44:50] last church age
[44:52] he's not saying i've not departed from
[44:54] you
[44:55] i'm with you
[44:56] even in you till the end
[44:59] ask anything of the father in my name
[45:02] and he shall grant it be what's he
[45:05] speaking of he's speaking of now of the
[45:08] relationship of the father to respond to
[45:13] his children
[45:16] he begins to preach this whole
[45:18] relationship of response to the jews
[45:21] which is something totally new to them
[45:26] and look who's responding first
[45:30] beggars and sinners and leopards and
[45:32] sick people
[45:34] not none of the high society
[45:39] and what are they doing they're trying
[45:41] him
[45:44] because this is the kind of god he is i
[45:48] am now going to respond to you
[45:51] i've washed you clean you're pleasant in
[45:54] my sight
[45:58] through the blood
[46:01] i can worship you
[46:04] with you
[46:08] beautiful
[46:10] and now he's saying try
[46:12] me prove me
[46:17] see if
[46:18] i keep my word
[46:21] one of the writers said you have not
[46:23] because you won
[46:24] ask not do you ask not because you don't
[46:28] believe he will
[46:30] respond
[46:34] and his whole relationship now
[46:37] he's trying to change the whole
[46:40] uh
[46:41] whole magnitude
[46:44] of what he wants you to feel about him
[46:51] he wants you to understand
[46:54] you can't worship me without me
[46:56] responding
[47:00] you will not have worship without
[47:02] response
[47:05] those are his attitude
[47:07] towards us
[47:09] we're always talking about our attitude
[47:11] towards him our life towards him
[47:15] what we ought to do for him how we ought
[47:17] to live for him
[47:20] let's just stop for a moment
[47:22] let's just don't go into this meeting
[47:25] about us
[47:30] he wants to share himself
[47:33] he wants to
[47:34] he wants our relationship
[47:37] with him to be enhanced
[47:39] he wants us to know i'm here for you
[47:42] i've got your back
[47:44] i'm with you in this
[47:48] talk to me
[47:50] ask
[47:52] i'm not going to give you a stone
[47:55] i'm not going to give you a fish i'm
[47:57] going to give you whatsoever things you
[47:59] ask
[48:00] prove me try me
[48:03] let's
[48:04] let's understand even the captivity in
[48:07] babylon
[48:09] and they they went away from god and
[48:12] they got captive but he said i'm not
[48:14] going to leave you in that captivity
[48:17] i'm going to bring you back
[48:20] and establish a relationship with you
[48:24] and the only way you can have a
[48:26] relationship with me
[48:28] is to know me
[48:30] and
[48:31] to know that i respond
[48:36] he wasn't bringing him back out of
[48:38] captivity so they could just worship him
[48:40] afar off
[48:42] he wants to be there he wants to be
[48:44] active he wants to be involved
[48:47] said he's a father he's the good
[48:49] shepherd he'll leave the 99 for the one
[48:53] everything about it that you begin to
[48:55] see jesus preaching he's now preaching
[48:58] the father's response to his redeemed
[49:02] children
[49:04] israel rejected it
[49:08] so he brought it over to the gentiles
[49:12] but he can't change
[49:17] it's thrilling
[49:20] so he's a god that
[49:23] that responds so let's don't admit that
[49:26] this meeting
[49:27] that we're
[49:29] going into
[49:30] to be worship
[49:32] without response
[49:34] because you're leaving him out
[49:40] what did jesus teach
[49:42] he says no man does this or does that
[49:45] that it's not rewarded to him
[49:48] a hundredfold in this life
[49:50] and the life to come what's he talking
[49:53] about he's talking about response
[49:56] response everywhere you start reading in
[49:59] the scripture
[50:00] its response how god responds how he
[50:04] reacts how he thinks
[50:07] how he does
[50:09] it's all about
[50:11] i'm i will respond
[50:15] and
[50:16] i i and isn't it funny but the very word
[50:21] that he preaches
[50:23] creates desire in our heart that
[50:27] what we want is we want him
[50:31] we want victory over sin we want our
[50:34] spirits right we want our attitudes
[50:37] right we want to get rid of our worry we
[50:40] want to get rid of things that are
[50:42] ungodly it's it's it's it's it's such a
[50:46] fantastic thing that's happening
[50:50] he's transforming the prayer of our
[50:52] heart
[50:53] and then he's there
[50:55] to respond to that prayer
[50:57] and manifest
[50:59] himself
[51:00] so you know i just wanted to share that
[51:02] with you because i thought well you know
[51:05] this year we didn't invite a lot of
[51:07] people and
[51:10] and we just invited our church
[51:13] and
[51:14] i i like a successful meeting
[51:17] i like when the spirit moves
[51:20] i like uh
[51:22] you know
[51:23] i like the emotion as long as it's
[51:26] controlled in in the word of god
[51:28] uh
[51:29] and i don't want to limit any praise or
[51:32] shouting or
[51:33] anything like that you know just don't
[51:35] shout any higher than you live and and
[51:38] you're in good shape
[51:40] you know
[51:42] but
[51:44] to to come in
[51:46] to a meeting
[51:48] and
[51:49] to be in anticipation
[51:52] and hear god reveal himself to you or
[51:56] speak to you
[51:57] and
[51:59] know
[52:00] that he has a
[52:02] response for you
[52:05] because he knows his thoughts towards
[52:07] you
[52:08] he knows what your heart's desire is
[52:12] and actually to be in anticipation
[52:16] to see the response of god
[52:19] going forward throughout the meeting
[52:22] as we begin to change our relationship
[52:27] with him
[52:29] we're confident that who we are we those
[52:32] things are established
[52:34] now he's he's creating the cry of our
[52:38] heart
[52:41] that he can respond
[52:43] to that cry
[52:45] father may they be one as we are one
[52:50] may they know the love that you love me
[52:53] and that
[52:56] full change
[52:58] that is transforming in the church
[53:02] from not just always being from the
[53:04] standpoint
[53:05] of we got to do this and we got to serve
[53:08] this and we got to do this and it's it's
[53:10] all on us
[53:13] he looks out and he says come unto me
[53:16] all ye that are heavy laden and i'll
[53:18] give you a rest
[53:20] my yoke is easy my burden is light
[53:24] ask anything of the father

[1:02:58] the cross for us you knew that there
[1:03:00] would be a people that would need a
[1:03:01] provision

[1:03:05] looking for a response
[1:03:07] lord we might not be able to have
[1:03:09] planned out our family situation our

[1:03:44] devil lord we know that he can only be

[1:03:50] they need to be in lord it's all grace
[1:03:53] grace grace we thank you for that lord
[1:03:56] even the meetings that are coming up
[1:03:57] lord we can take two men from opposite
[1:03:59] sides of the country lord and they can
[1:04:01] come together and they can be in the
[1:04:03] same vein lord speaking to a group of
[1:04:05] people
[1:04:06] lord they didn't they didn't talk to
[1:04:07] brother david and they don't know any
[1:04:09] situations in our churches and what
[1:04:10] we're going through lord but you can
[1:04:12] take a vessel and you can speak through
[1:04:14] it lord to a knee that's on our heart
