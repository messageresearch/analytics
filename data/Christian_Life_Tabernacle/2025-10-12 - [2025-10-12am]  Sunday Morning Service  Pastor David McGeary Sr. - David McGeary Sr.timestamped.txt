[8:57] him guide our life. Amen. the word like
[8:59] brother Andrew if you could just come
[9:00] and open our service in prayer. Amen.
[9:16] Man, it's good to be in the house of the
[9:17] Lord. I honor the resurrection. How many
[9:19] has come with expectation?
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to meet us here each
[9:24] one. And let's just go to him in prayer
[9:27] together.
[9:29] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you God
[9:32] that your grace has afforded us another
[9:35] day on earth, Lord. That oh God, we can
[9:39] make preparations to meet you, Lord.
[9:42] Lord, in this hour, Lord, when we see
[9:44] darkness all around, Lord, we thank you
[9:46] for providing light at the end time,
[9:48] Father. Lord, something to guide us,
[9:51] Lord. something to lead us to the place
[9:54] where we can take refuge, Lord. That we
[9:56] can find a defense from the arrows of
[10:00] the enemy. Lord, we want to come here,
[10:02] Lord, to feast at your table, Lord, to
[10:06] receive food in due season, Father. And
[10:09] Lord, we want to be like, oh God, that
[10:12] woman, Lord, she had to get to Jesus,
[10:15] Lord. Though they had a great feast and
[10:17] Simon wanted to make fun, Lord, that's
[10:19] not why we're here, Lord. We want to do
[10:21] you a service, Lord. We want to take
[10:23] this stench off of you, Lord, that the
[10:25] world put the smud and tried to call
[10:28] this message, which is Christ, some
[10:30] filth. But oh God, we're here to testify
[10:33] and say, Lord, it's the life. It's the
[10:35] only life. It's the only hope. There's
[10:38] this is the only love, oh God. This is
[10:41] the only real peace, Lord, is what we
[10:43] found in you through this message, Lord,
[10:45] through your eternal promise. Father, as
[10:48] we oh God, want you to be the guest of
[10:51] honor, Lord. We'll oh God, our praises
[10:54] touch you, Lord. And will you speak
[10:56] back, oh God? We want to be changed,
[10:58] Lord. We don't want to be the same
[10:59] person, Lord. When that woman did you
[11:02] that service, she was a different
[11:03] person, Lord. She came to the right
[11:05] place, Father. And that's what we
[11:07] believe this morning, Lord. That we've
[11:08] come to the right place, Lord. And that
[11:11] you're going to answer for by the
[11:13] preaching of your word, Lord. We commit
[11:15] this time the testimonies, the songs. Oh
[11:18] God, everything that'll be done and
[11:21] said, Lord, may you be glorified, Lord.
[11:23] Use the pastor, use the office, Lord.
[11:26] Use, oh God, the anointing of the word,
[11:29] Lord. Let it anchor in our heart. And
[11:31] Lord, fill us with your goodness. Lord,
[11:33] may we go rejoicing, Lord, because the
[11:36] love of God touched us and gave us
[11:38] strength and health, oh God. We commit
[11:40] all the needs to your great hand in
[11:43] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be gathered in the
[11:51] presence of the Lord. Amen. I know we
[11:53] have many out and many went to the
[11:55] Louisiana meetings and Amen. We're here
[11:58] to worship the Lord. Amen. We welcome
[12:00] all our visitors. God bless you. Let's
[12:02] open our Bible for a psalm reading.
[12:04] Amen. A very short Psalm reading. Psalm
[12:06] 67. Amen. I'll read the first. will join
[12:09] together in the last. Amen.
[12:21] Amen. It says, "God be merciful unto us
[12:24] and bless us and cause his face to shine
[12:28] upon us.
[12:36] Let the people praise thee, oh God. Let
[12:39] all the people praise thee.
[12:52] Let the people praise thee, oh God. Let
[12:54] all the people praise thee.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; God shall bless us and all the ends of
[13:06] the earth shall fear him. Amen. I
[13:10] believe we could turn around and welcome
[13:11] someone this morning in the house of
[13:14] God. Amen.
[13:18] Amen.

[27:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many
[27:17] are happy to be in his presence this
[27:19] morning? Amen. Uh today is a special day
[27:24] and a very special one indeed. Amen.
[27:28] Amen. It's Sister Leslie's birthday.
[27:38] Amen.
[27:40] Amen. We certainly appreciate her. You
[27:43] know, she works behind the scenes very
[27:45] hard and and and you know, she never
[27:48] forgets anybody's birthday. Even if she
[27:50] does, she'll come right away and and let
[27:53] you know. And you know, I could say
[27:55] every one of our lives in this church
[27:57] has been touched by Sister Leslie and
[28:00] all that she does. and she's always
[28:02] behind the scenes and working things out
[28:04] to make sure everything goes okay. You
[28:07] know, I was thinking about that say they
[28:08] say behind every great man, there's a
[28:10] great woman.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; And man, she's really a type. And and I
[28:14] want to just say this. I know, you know,
[28:16] usually in settings like this, I know
[28:19] she's probably trying to disappear right
[28:21] now, but she's a very real type of what
[28:24] the bride is. Amen. The bride of Christ.
[28:27] That's what we're called to be. We
[28:28] certainly appreciate her. God bless you
[28:30] and happy birthday. Amen. Amen. Don't
[28:33] forget our meetings that are coming up.
[28:36] I know uh we just want to confirm the
[28:38] dates. It's November 14, 15, and 16. Um
[28:42] I know we usually have it on the second
[28:45] weekend and so there was a little bit of
[28:47] confusion. So it's the second full
[28:49] weekend, which is the 14th, 15th, and
[28:52] 16th of November. and we want to be
[28:54] praying about it and just do all that we
[28:56] can so that the Lord will come and and
[28:59] certainly visit us. Amen. Amen. I I I
[29:02] believe that it's uh every day we come
[29:05] to church is a special day. And and I'll
[29:08] say this, we we we we as believers of
[29:11] this message with the prophecies that
[29:14] we've been given, we we we have to come
[29:17] to a place where we don't take this for
[29:19] granted.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; We know these buildings are going to
[29:22] become warehouses. So we have to cherish
[29:24] every moment we gather together and know
[29:26] that it could be the last one. Who
[29:28] knows? So we want to put all of our
[29:31] effort not just for the meeting, even
[29:32] for the service this morning and say,
[29:34] "Lord, I have come and and I'm here so
[29:37] that your word can become a reality in
[29:39] my life." Amen. That's our heart's
[29:41] desire, man. I know we have many that
[29:43] went to the Louisiana meetings and some
[29:45] are traveling. We certainly want to
[29:47] remember them this morning. Um, sister
[29:50] Lori uh uh put in a request for brother
[29:52] Daniel's surgery. We just want to
[29:54] continue to lift her up in prayer.
[29:56] Brother Daniel, in prayer that the
[29:58] surgery will go well, that he may come
[30:00] out uh uh healed and well, that he may
[30:03] uh his strength may be restored and all
[30:06] of that. And if you have a need upon
[30:07] your heart, just lift your hand up to
[30:09] him. But Tim has some announcements to
[30:11] come and make this morning. So, we'll
[30:13] just have him uh uh come and give the
[30:16] announcements and pray for the request
[30:17] this morning. God bless you.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Good morning. Good to see
[30:26] you from this side again. Um
[30:33] I reiterate uh happy birthday, Sister
[30:36] Lesley.
[30:38] Um
[30:40] yeah, I was thinking about that on my
[30:42] drive to and from work. I see a
[30:44] billboard
[30:47] and it says 45 years in ministry
[30:51] pastors
[30:53] and it gives the man's name and it gives
[30:55] the wife's name.
[30:57] They advertise that oh it's dual
[30:59] pastorship. We don't advertise that.
[31:03] But I can attest
[31:05] sometimes you see good in a man that's
[31:09] because his wife reminds him to be good.
[31:14] And I don't mean that just jokingly,
[31:18] but they're our helpmate.
[31:23] You know,
[31:24] I've got several Bibles and I was
[31:27] looking back. You see the green sticky
[31:30] and I know I'm up here to make an
[31:31] announcement, but just can't help
[31:33] myself. And uh one of my notes
[31:39] has on it, and I may have already said
[31:40] it, I don't know.
[31:43] So, what was Eve's maiden name? You ever
[31:47] thought about that?
[31:51] You know, every woman has to undergo
[31:54] a name change and it's difficult to get
[31:57] used to writing your name a certain way.
[31:59] You may not even like it, but that's
[32:01] part of it.
[32:03] Ease maiden name. Anybody have a gander
[32:07] at that? Think they know?
[32:10] I'd say it was Adam
[32:13] &gt;&gt; because she was part of him.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; And I think each one of us bear a name
[32:23] and we are him.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we strive to be. I was
[32:27] thinking if I had a word of the day
[32:28] today, it would be vulnerability.
[32:31] I was thinking I was sharing with
[32:32] brother Andrew after he preached that
[32:34] message a couple weeks ago on Wednesday
[32:36] night about witnessing. A lot of times
[32:38] we don't witness because we're too
[32:41] vulnerable. We put our self out there.
[32:44] Think, "Oh, can I answer this question?
[32:45] Do I want this person to know what I
[32:47] stand for?"
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Sure, we want them to know.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; But Paul taught us says, "For not he
[32:56] that commendeth himself is approved, but
[32:59] he whom God hath commanded."
[33:02] &gt;&gt; And I think for each of us, we have a
[33:04] place in the body. It's not because
[33:06] we've wedged oursel in or we've taken
[33:08] control and gotten in. It's because he's
[33:10] placed us there. Let's own up to that,
[33:12] realize that, embrace that, and
[33:15] advertise that and get somebody else to
[33:18] fill in that little niche so far that
[33:21] may be still out there that has to be
[33:23] redeemed.
[33:25] Amen. and the vulnerability side of it.
[33:28] David in the psalm I read a couple weeks
[33:30] ago
[33:32] said, "Rejoice the soul of thy servant,
[33:35] for unto thee, Lord, do I lift up my
[33:37] soul." That's
[33:38] &gt;&gt; right.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord knows our hearts. He knows our
[33:40] soul. But there's something that part of
[33:43] us as human beings. Brother Brandham
[33:46] called it that access in.
[33:49] We're free moral agents. We make that
[33:51] decision either to allow this in or that
[33:53] in. And there's something vulnerable
[33:56] about vulnerable about it. We lift up
[33:58] our souls to the Lord. It's an act, a
[34:00] conscious act to say, Lord, I want you
[34:02] to take control. And Jeremiah in
[34:04] Lamentations says, "Let us lift up our
[34:07] hearts with our hands unto the God of
[34:09] heaven."
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; It's hard to imagine me taking my heart
[34:13] and lifting it up to the Lord. But when
[34:15] we yield ourselves and lift our hands,
[34:17] he has access, full and complete access.
[34:20] Let's give him that this morning.
[34:22] uh the advert or the the uh the
[34:24] announcement I want to make are
[34:26] concerning Sunday school and that is
[34:28] they're going to be on the 18th between
[34:30] 2 and 5. Everyone with young children is
[34:32] invited. If you're too young for Sunday
[34:34] school, you're still invited to come
[34:36] between 2 and 5. Uh there'll be lots of
[34:39] games, activities, and such that's going
[34:41] on. Uh we do ask that if you don't mind
[34:45] bringing the drink that your child
[34:47] likes, bring some drinks for yours and
[34:49] maybe someone else. We'll have some
[34:51] basics there, water and tea and such,
[34:53] but if you have anything special you
[34:55] want to just bring that and uh and
[34:57] there'll be plenty to eat and desserts
[34:59] all around. And also, you may have
[35:02] noticed there's a big uh whatever you
[35:06] want to call it, sister call it amazing.
[35:08] There's a maze over here in the back
[35:10] that we've constructed. Considerable
[35:11] amount of effort and time involved. And
[35:14] there's stakes in the ground. We just
[35:17] want you to be careful and leave that
[35:20] children, parents alike, leave that by
[35:23] itself. Let's not even get close to it.
[35:26] And uh I was told to threaten you, but
[35:29] uh like, hey, you wouldn't be able to
[35:31] participate on Saturday if we see you in
[35:33] the maze, but uh please respect anything
[35:36] as you know, Wednesday night service.
[35:38] We'll probably have some more things up
[35:39] stage back there. So, we're uh looking
[35:41] forward to a good day and we want to
[35:44] make sure you aware that please stay
[35:47] away for now. Um
[35:51] I think that's about it. I've got it
[35:53] covered. All right. So, let's just if we
[35:55] would let's stand yield ourselves.
[35:59] We are we're free moral agents and we
[36:01] want to give our our conscious effort to
[36:02] enter in and allow the Lord to do what
[36:06] he has to do this morning.
[36:09] Let's bow our heads. A gracious and kind
[36:11] heavenly father, we thank you, Lord,
[36:13] once again for the assembly of this body
[36:15] together. Lord, we pray that we can come
[36:18] in one mind, one accord, Lord, for we're
[36:20] in your presence. We're in your spirit,
[36:22] Lord. Lord, you can cast down all
[36:25] reasoning, all fears, anything that
[36:28] would hinder your movement. Lord, we ask
[36:30] Lord, you just take away now, Lord, that
[36:33] we may put our faith into the things
[36:36] that have been mentioned here, Lord,
[36:38] upcoming surgeries and oh, even lost
[36:41] loved ones. We think of the little
[36:42] burned child,
[36:44] Lord. Many things that we have need of
[36:46] that we just place on your throne, Lord.
[36:49] Lord, truly we lift up our spirits, our
[36:51] souls, our
[36:53] even our health and our strength, Lord,
[36:55] we ask you just to renew us, Lord, for
[36:58] having been in your presence today,
[37:00] Lord. And when your word comes forth,
[37:03] Lord, that's what we're here for is to
[37:05] gain benefit, honor, and glory unto you,
[37:07] Lord, that we can accept your word and
[37:10] apply it to our lives and make an
[37:12] eternal difference. We pray, Lord, that
[37:14] all this would have its effect, Lord.
[37:19] Lord, as we continue to sing these
[37:21] songs, Lord, just prepare us that
[37:23] ground, Lord. Just till us up, make us
[37:25] fertile so when the word comes forth,
[37:28] Lord, it can fall and just water the
[37:30] seed that's on the inside. Grant it, oh
[37:32] Lord. Lord, just use the tithes and
[37:35] offerings we collect for your honor and
[37:36] your glory. As we look to you to provide
[37:39] for everything we have need of, and we
[37:41] ask and believe these things in the name
[37:43] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And may
[37:46] I quickly add uh that's my brother
[37:48] that's going to be going in for surgery.
[37:50] He had a some sort of procedure of
[37:52] myogram.
[37:54] They put die in your system injected in
[37:56] your spine and look and I believe the
[38:00] Lord is already on the scene answered
[38:02] prayer.
[38:05] He was he's so uh
[38:09] damaged or messed up from years. Uh he
[38:13] had previous surgeries, but he's had a
[38:14] lot of collapsed disc and and things.
[38:16] They were going to have to go from the
[38:18] inside obviously take all of his
[38:20] internals out, access it, flip him back
[38:22] over, and then go from the back also.
[38:24] But the procedure showed that they can
[38:26] do everything from the back. So, we're
[38:28] thankful for that. And I think the Lord
[38:30] is already answering prayers. So, we we
[38:32] do coveret your prayers in that regard.
[38:33] Lord bless you,
[38:35] [Music]
[38:38] man. You may be seated.
[38:40] Oh, what gift of grace
[38:44] is Jesus my redeemer.
[38:49] There is no more
[38:52] from heaven now to give him.
[38:57] He is my joy,
[39:00] my righteousness
[39:02] and free.
[39:04] Oh, and my steadfast love,
[39:08] my deepest, boundless peace. Oh, and to

[42:43] When the praise is
[42:47] still my shall
[42:51] not
[42:53] just sing that last one again
[42:56] to this I oh and to this I
[43:01] my hope is only Jesus
[43:07] all the glory
[43:10] and
[43:11] True.
[43:15] When the race is complete, still I live
[43:21] shall be yet
[43:25] through Christ
[43:27] in me.
[43:32] There is a soul
[43:36] singing times of need.
[43:40] that gives me hope.
[43:44] Oh, and that brings me peace
[43:49] in every trial.
[43:52] Oh, and to every test.

[46:35] [Music]
[46:39] Take
[46:42] the battle.
[46:46] Amen.
[46:47] Father, we're glad the battle's yours.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Father, we're glad that you love us,
[46:55] that you loved us so much you sent your
[46:58] only begotten son.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And Father, that he's the way, the
[47:04] truth, and the life.
[47:08] And no man comes unto you, Father, but
[47:12] by him.
[47:15] And father, may
[47:17] that revelation grow deeper in our heart
[47:20] and
[47:23] may we understand what the challenge for
[47:26] each of us is in the hour that we live
[47:29] in.
[47:31] Father, our our young people and
[47:36] the live in a day that
[47:39] many of us have never seen.
[47:42] Father, what's presented to them and
[47:47] what's they're up against?
[47:50] Father, when I was young, there was
[47:53] three television stations,
[47:57] ABC, NBC, and CBS,
[48:01] and that was it all.
[48:04] But now, Father, there's so much.
[48:08] We need you to be more strong and
[48:10] powerful in our lives than ever before.
[48:13] Help us meet the challenge of the hour.
[48:16] We ask these things this morning. In
[48:19] Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[48:23] God bless. You may be seated.
[48:26] We have several out over in the meetings
[48:29] in Louisiana and we certainly trust that
[48:32] they have a wonderful time.
[48:34] And and uh I uh I also um
[48:39] Leslie told me this morning she says you
[48:42] can't announce my birthday without
[48:45] telling everybody it's Magna's birthday
[48:47] and Claudia's birthday also. So we
[48:51] definitely want to uh recognize uh them
[48:57] and and their birthday. And uh I like
[49:00] what brother Tim said, you know,
[49:02] sometimes you just got to have somebody
[49:04] that keeps you straight. And uh so she
[49:07] works full time. Uh
[49:11] believe me, and uh so I of course I
[49:14] appreciate her, but uh we'll go. I'm not
[49:18] going to sing a special if you thinking
[49:20] that uh we're going somewhere this
[49:22] morning. Uh they look at me. Are you
[49:25] going to sing? No. No, I'm not gonna
[49:28] sing. I I'm not a very good singer, but
[49:31] um uh uh we love the Lord. So, uh
[49:38] brother uh Tim, they built a maze out
[49:40] there and they worked all day long
[49:42] making working on that maze out there.
[49:46] So, we want we don't want all the young
[49:49] kids to run up there and tear it down
[49:52] before it's uh built. So, uh you just
[49:57] do your best. I was the one that told
[49:59] them to threaten them. I said, "If they
[50:02] get in that maze, they're not going to
[50:04] go there next week." And he looked at me
[50:06] like, "You, no, Brother McGary, that's
[50:08] an idol threat."
[50:10] But so we won't threaten you. We just
[50:12] ask you to be good and stay true. Now,
[50:15] if you have grandchildren, uh you can
[50:18] certainly come out to our thing next
[50:20] week. Um if you're an old person, you
[50:23] can come out. We just wanted to draw the
[50:25] distinction that it's not a young
[50:27] people's event like teenagers and stuff
[50:30] like that. It's for the Sunday school
[50:32] and all the kids and family um members
[50:36] younger. So, uh we're going to uh just
[50:41] kind of go forward this morning and in
[50:44] fellowship around the word of God. And
[50:47] um so as you stand, so I don't mean to
[50:50] have you stand instead, but if you uh
[50:52] stand, we're going to read a few
[50:54] scriptures and um um
[50:59] this morning and fellowship around God's
[51:01] word. And I I'd like to read this
[51:03] statement. I thought it was um uh an
[51:08] outstanding
[51:10] um Let me see if I brought it out with
[51:12] me. I think I did.
[51:15] Um, but
[51:18] I thought this was quite an approach. It
[51:21] said, "I want to speak to you something
[51:25] to bring something
[51:28] to enlighten
[51:30] enlighten to you the promises of God for
[51:35] this age. Not something that somebody
[51:38] else was in some other day, but
[51:42] something when them things are all
[51:45] right. We refer to those things. But I
[51:47] thought I would try to bring something
[51:49] to your mind with these scriptures I've
[51:53] got written here that would enlighten
[51:55] you to know what to make you a better
[51:59] soldier in the field that you're
[52:03] fighting in now.
[52:06] And so I thought that's kind of where my
[52:08] heart is this morning to bring us some
[52:11] enlightenment to where that we are now
[52:15] and what we're fighting now. And um that
[52:20] statement was from Satan's Eden. And
[52:22] there's also something else I thought
[52:25] was nice and is and I think if we can
[52:29] get this little part of this to us, it
[52:34] says, "So God knew that we would be
[52:37] here, but when he put us in the flesh so
[52:44] we could be contacted,
[52:47] so God knew you would be here."
[52:50] Right here. Yes.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; In this age, in this time, and he put
[52:54] you here so that he could contact you.
[52:59] And I think that's the part that we kind
[53:02] of leave out a lot. God is longing to
[53:06] contact us. So, if we have our Bibles,
[53:09] let's turn to Matthew.
[53:12] Um, and we're and this is the 10th
[53:14] chapter of the Gospel of Matthew.
[53:18] And I and to read uh
[53:22] uh verse 32 and 33
[53:31] it says wherefore
[53:35] no 3 uh 2 says whosoever therefore
[53:41] shall confess me before men him will I
[53:45] confess also
[53:48] before my father which is in heaven.
[53:52] But whosoever shall deny
[53:55] me before men, him will I also deny
[54:00] before my father which is in heaven. Now
[54:04] this is a a very tremendous verse. We
[54:07] won't labor on it long. Think not that I
[54:10] am come to send peace on earth.
[54:14] I come not to send peace, but a sword.
[54:19] For I am come to set a man at variance
[54:24] against his father, and the daughter
[54:27] against her mother, and the
[54:30] daughter-in-law
[54:31] against her mother-in-law.
[54:34] And a man's foe shall be they of his own
[54:38] household.
[54:40] For he that loveth father and mother
[54:44] more than me is not worthy of me. And he
[54:48] that loveth son or daughter more than me
[54:51] is not worthy of me. And he that taketh
[54:56] not his cross and followeth after me is
[55:00] not worthy of me. Our gracious father,
[55:04] we ask you to bless your word to us this
[55:07] morning. You may be seated.
[55:09] We'd also like to turn over
[55:12] to uh two scriptures found one in the
[55:17] beginning of Galatians
[55:20] and this is uh Galatians uh 1 through uh
[55:25] 4.
[55:28] It says, "I, Paul, an apostle, not of
[55:32] men, neither by man,
[55:36] but by Jesus Christ and God the Father,
[55:40] who raised him from the dead,
[55:45] and all the brethren which are with me
[55:48] unto the church of Galatia.
[55:51] Grace be to you and peace from God the
[55:55] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom
[55:58] gave himself for our sins, that he might
[56:02] deliver us from this present evil world
[56:07] according to the will of God and our
[56:11] Father, to whom be glory forever and
[56:14] ever. who he gave himself for our sins
[56:17] that he might deliver us from this
[56:21] present evil world. And then also we'd
[56:26] like to read over in the fourth uh
[56:29] chapter of the book of second
[56:31] Corinthians.
[56:35] And it says here it says, "Therefore,
[56:38] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[56:42] received mercy and faint not, but have
[56:47] renounced the hidden things of
[56:49] dishonesty,
[56:50] not walking in craftiness,
[56:53] nor handling the word of God
[56:56] deceitfully,
[56:58] but by manifestation of the truth,
[57:02] commending ourselves to every man's
[57:05] conscience in the sight of God. But if
[57:09] our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
[57:12] that are lost.
[57:14] In whom the God of this world hath
[57:19] blinded the minds of them which believe
[57:23] not. The God of this world
[57:28] has blinded the minds of them which
[57:32] believe not. Lest the light of the
[57:35] glorious gospel of Christ whom is the
[57:40] image of God should shine unto them.
[57:46] Amen. We hear two references here
[57:51] uh this morning. And one is the God of
[57:57] this present evil world. And also we we
[58:03] hear the reference uh here of the God,
[58:09] the God of this world and this present
[58:11] evil. So if we just looked at those
[58:15] scriptures, we're living in an evil age
[58:18] that we might be delivered from this
[58:20] evil age. And then the scripture tells
[58:23] us that there's a God of this evil age.
[58:27] And we read that the we wanted to preach
[58:31] the gospel
[58:33] uh for the battle that we're in.
[58:39] And it when this gets established in our
[58:43] hearts that we're in a battle that life
[58:48] is a a battle. It's a constant warfare.
[58:51] And uh Paul wrote it in the scriptures
[58:54] this way. He says, "Satan's like a
[58:56] roaring lion going about seeking whom he
[59:01] may devour." Now, we don't want to look
[59:04] at that. You know, we it there's a part
[59:06] of us that doesn't want to face reality.
[59:10] And so, Satan has given us a lot of
[59:12] reality escape outlets. Uh uh ways to
[59:17] escape reality. Uh you know, the sports
[59:21] world is a big uh reality uh escape
[59:27] world. you know, everybody will be
[59:28] rooting for their team and and there's
[59:31] all kinds of people out at the game and
[59:34] they're screaming and hollering and
[59:36] tailgate partying and they carry on. I
[59:39] mean, and you somebody's going to win
[59:41] and lose, you know, and then all week
[59:43] long they're going to want to fire the
[59:46] coach and get rid of the owner and and
[59:49] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[59:53] And it starts all over again next week.
[59:57] And then they lose and it's next year
[1:00:01] and you know and and they they crown a
[1:00:04] champion and oh he's the champion of the
[1:00:08] world and and they they won this thing
[1:00:11] and that thing and this Super Bowl and
[1:00:14] and all that and it's it's uh it's just
[1:00:19] it's it's an escape
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; from the reality
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; if you can fill yourself with so much
[1:00:27] stuff in your mind that you don't want
[1:00:31] to look at the reality that we're living
[1:00:35] in. And because it it because it's what
[1:00:39] Jesus said. He said, "I didn't come, you
[1:00:42] know, to bring peace, but I've came to
[1:00:44] bring a sword. There's going to be a
[1:00:47] variance. There's going to be a
[1:00:49] difference.
[1:00:50] uh I'm going to separate fathers from
[1:00:53] mothers and and daughters. And he's not
[1:00:56] talking about maybe so much individual
[1:00:59] families, but as he's looking out, he's
[1:01:02] looking out and he's seeing he says that
[1:01:05] there's there's a going to be a great
[1:01:07] cultural difference and and people want
[1:01:11] to be successful. Uh, you know, uh,
[1:01:14] people will take their, uh, child and
[1:01:17] they'll get him a tutor and they'll go
[1:01:20] hire him a baseball coach and they'll
[1:01:22] they'll put them in some sort of high
[1:01:25] league or they'll get him a computer.
[1:01:28] Everything that they can do to get their
[1:01:32] child ahead in the world,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; they'll they'll preach education
[1:01:39] uh, trying to get them more educated. uh
[1:01:42] more into science more more so that they
[1:01:45] can uh maybe obtain a better way of life
[1:01:49] and and and wealth and and and in one
[1:01:53] sense they're teaching them to build
[1:01:55] their treasures up here on earth,
[1:01:58] you know, have a better life on earth,
[1:02:00] have money, have a a you know, have a
[1:02:03] retirement program, buy a house, drive a
[1:02:07] a car, you know, and this great push
[1:02:11] for for for prosperity
[1:02:15] and and not to be, you know, and uh here
[1:02:19] comes one that didn't even have a place
[1:02:21] to lay his head.
[1:02:24] You know, he's not talking about success
[1:02:26] in this world. He's talking about the
[1:02:29] fact of the matter that there's a life
[1:02:31] after this world that that this world is
[1:02:35] not our home. This is not our kingdom.
[1:02:38] In fact, it it's not even our Eden.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; It's Satan's Eden.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; But this is what he he developed
[1:02:49] civilization that he he told Eve, he
[1:02:52] deceived Eve. He told her, "If you eat
[1:02:55] of this fruit, you know, you'll
[1:02:57] increase. You'll have knowledge and
[1:02:59] wisdom and you'll increase and and
[1:03:03] you'll you'll be like God's."
[1:03:06] And and men's like gods. They they
[1:03:09] create things. They uh they don't create
[1:03:12] I I shouldn't have used that word.
[1:03:14] There's only one creator. But they'll
[1:03:16] take elements of mathematics and and
[1:03:20] these uh all these uh scientific things
[1:03:25] to try to make life better and and and
[1:03:28] and delve into space and and and shoot
[1:03:32] rockets to the moon and and aren't you
[1:03:36] all glad that somebody walked on the
[1:03:39] moon?
[1:03:43] You know, I I I didn't I I didn't get
[1:03:46] one thing out of them walking on the
[1:03:48] moon,
[1:03:52] you know, but it's the accomplishment of
[1:03:55] man. We put a man on the moon. What is
[1:03:58] that to give you? Expectations
[1:04:01] of what else they can do. But this it's
[1:04:04] it's deceitful
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; and and this you know and every answer
[1:04:14] that for every age is already written in
[1:04:19] the Bible
[1:04:23] for the believer in that age. every
[1:04:26] answer for every age is already written
[1:04:30] in the Bible for the believers of that
[1:04:33] age.
[1:04:35] And you know, I was struck to find out,
[1:04:38] you know, I always thought that I don't
[1:04:40] have my phone with me. I don't preach
[1:04:42] with a tablet. I'm I'm not like these
[1:04:45] guys that could actually I don't trust
[1:04:47] them. Okay? You know what I mean? But
[1:04:51] but
[1:04:53] how many adults play video games?
[1:04:59] You know, I've been living in the dark
[1:05:01] ages. I thought that was something like
[1:05:04] the junior high kids did.
[1:05:07] You know what I mean? And and there's a
[1:05:10] whole industry
[1:05:12] of people that write programs so adults
[1:05:16] can sit around and
[1:05:24] and and they'll live in there.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Oh, I've got,
[1:05:33] you know, I killed 20,000
[1:05:36] soldiers in conquest of of the planet of
[1:05:41] apes or something like that. I mean, you
[1:05:45] you can't hardly even get it across to
[1:05:49] people
[1:05:51] how deceptive
[1:05:53] this age is. We are living in the most
[1:05:58] deceptive age of every time there ever
[1:06:02] was.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; It it it it's almost there's there's so
[1:06:09] much that's going on, so much that's
[1:06:12] hidden, so so many spirits at work
[1:06:16] because so much battle in in the mind of
[1:06:20] believers. The the whole purpose o of
[1:06:24] the enemy in the very beginning was to
[1:06:27] exalt himself
[1:06:30] above
[1:06:32] God's angels and his stars and to put
[1:06:36] himself on the throne of God that he
[1:06:39] could be worshiped as God.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be the God of this age. And
[1:06:47] Paul comes back and he says, "Through
[1:06:49] Jesus Christ, who by his grace has
[1:06:52] delivered us from the God of this evil
[1:06:56] age." And and so you say, "Well, why are
[1:07:00] you you up here uh preaching this
[1:07:03] morning?" You know, yeah, I'm not
[1:07:06] motivated by the popularity and I'm not
[1:07:08] motivated by by the finances, but what I
[1:07:12] am motivated by is the truth.
[1:07:20] because there's there there there's
[1:07:22] nothing as he wrote here that is to be
[1:07:26] enlightened
[1:07:28] and you know my testimony that I I I
[1:07:32] grew up in the 60s so I I was in that
[1:07:35] rebellious age you know where where you
[1:07:38] you were against society you were
[1:07:41] against the war you were against the
[1:07:44] government and you wanted to be peace
[1:07:46] peace and and love and beads and and uh
[1:07:51] you know he psychedelics and and and
[1:07:55] smoking pot and and oh that was the life
[1:07:59] you know leather sandals and let your
[1:08:01] hair grow long. you know, and go down to
[1:08:04] the beach and and and you know, the less
[1:08:07] you could do, the happier you were,
[1:08:13] you know, just veg out,
[1:08:16] listen to music, you know, and and then
[1:08:20] you
[1:08:22] and oh, and you know what it was? It m
[1:08:26] remember it was a lie.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; It was It's not the truth.
[1:08:33] But by the enlightenment
[1:08:37] of divine revelation
[1:08:41] that God gave Isab
[1:08:49] and I I I I stopped a moment and uh I
[1:08:54] just I I I I took a moment and I I I
[1:08:59] stopped and Uh, and just if if I could
[1:09:05] say it that way and just looked around
[1:09:10] really what was going on. There was
[1:09:13] people taking too much drugs. There was
[1:09:16] people getting addicted to heroin. There
[1:09:18] was people getting addicted to cocaine.
[1:09:21] All those peace and loving people that I
[1:09:24] thought surrounded with me were stealing
[1:09:27] my albums. They were stealing my money.
[1:09:29] They were stealing my food.
[1:09:33] I went away for a week, came back to my
[1:09:37] own house, and there was a great big
[1:09:39] bunch of people in there
[1:09:43] cuz one of my friends invited his
[1:09:45] friends who, you know, it became a place
[1:09:47] they could run to, flop out, hide, you
[1:09:50] know. And I I walked in my own house and
[1:09:55] the guy come up to me. He says, "Hey,
[1:09:56] dude. I I don't think the guy would
[1:10:00] would want you to be here.
[1:10:05] I said, "Wait a minute, man."
[1:10:09] You know, and what was God doing
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; opening my eyes?
[1:10:17] You know what's what's really this isn't
[1:10:19] really peace, love, and joy. I was
[1:10:23] getting depressed. I was getting
[1:10:25] suicidal. uh go you know what I mean all
[1:10:28] this there was no peace there was no joy
[1:10:32] there was no longsuffering
[1:10:35] you know nobody wanted to care for
[1:10:38] anybody it was every man for themselves
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; right
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; and the reality of that
[1:10:46] there the when I had to face the reality
[1:10:50] of it
[1:10:52] I came to a place where I didn't want to
[1:10:57] go on anymore because I didn't know
[1:11:00] where to go. I didn't know there was
[1:11:02] another life. I didn't know that I found
[1:11:05] that my present reality
[1:11:08] was death.
[1:11:14] Because the wages of sin is death.
[1:11:19] The result of unbelief is death. If our
[1:11:24] gospel be hid, it is hid from them that
[1:11:27] are lost.
[1:11:30] And it was striking to find out that I
[1:11:33] was lost. Boy, I thought I was in
[1:11:36] control. I thought I had the world by
[1:11:38] its horns. I I thought I knew what the
[1:11:41] answer was. You know what I mean? Tune
[1:11:44] in, drop out. That was a wow, I've found
[1:11:48] life.
[1:11:50] But when your eyes are opened that that
[1:11:53] that is not the path that it's the it's
[1:11:58] a road to destruction
[1:12:02] and your eyes are open and you see that
[1:12:05] you had to face that and I I was to a
[1:12:09] place I had to face the fact that I
[1:12:11] didn't know where I was who I was. I
[1:12:13] started hanging around with people that
[1:12:15] were a whole lot more evil than I
[1:12:19] realized people could be.
[1:12:24] And I thought, who was so cool? I
[1:12:27] realized how naive and lost and
[1:12:31] vulnerable
[1:12:33] that I was and that I wasn't in control
[1:12:36] at all. I was being carried down the
[1:12:40] stream of life by spirits. Yeah.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And there was a host
[1:12:49] of spirits
[1:12:51] that were released from the pits of hell
[1:12:54] that were getting on people.
[1:12:59] And he was putting his spirits on people
[1:13:03] for his kingdom.
[1:13:05] The God of this evil age was getting
[1:13:09] people to do his bidding, his work while
[1:13:13] he was building his kingdom and exalting
[1:13:17] himself through science, education,
[1:13:21] politics, civilization, and all the
[1:13:24] stuff that he produced from the tree of
[1:13:26] knowledge that man was eating off of as
[1:13:30] fast as they could get. getting
[1:13:32] knowledge, getting uh the ways to make
[1:13:34] more money, ways to have greater
[1:13:36] businesses. They're feasting on on all
[1:13:40] this stuff he keeps providing for them,
[1:13:42] not realizing that he's just feeding you
[1:13:46] a little bit along the way to get you go
[1:13:48] to down the the the the trail like
[1:13:52] Hansel and Gretle.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; No, that's not in the Bible. Don't go
[1:13:57] looking up Hansel and Gretle
[1:14:00] in the Bible.
[1:14:03] It's a story about a witch
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; who put out breadcrumbs
[1:14:09] to lead people into captivity.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That's what Satan's done.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; He's put out breadcrumbs. What he did to
[1:14:20] Eve, put out a breadcrumb. You said,
[1:14:22] "Oh, if you eat this,
[1:14:26] this is the result." No. The wages of
[1:14:30] sin is death.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[1:14:38] The the deception.
[1:14:41] Well, I
[1:14:43] you know, I was lost.
[1:14:47] But I tell you one thing,
[1:14:49] a friend of mine who was no no more
[1:14:53] interested
[1:14:55] in God or anything, he he looked at me
[1:14:58] and he he said it jokingly and
[1:15:00] mockingly. Oh, why don't you read the
[1:15:02] Bible?
[1:15:07] Duh.
[1:15:09] Well, I was desperate,
[1:15:11] so I went and read Romans chapter 1.
[1:15:16] And here he's describing the world,
[1:15:18] truth breakers, incontinents, liars. Not
[1:15:21] wishing to retain God in their
[1:15:24] knowledge, God gave them over to a
[1:15:27] reprobate mind. In other words, having
[1:15:30] rejected the truth.
[1:15:35] God gave them over to imaginations,
[1:15:40] burning in their own lust,
[1:15:44] doing that which is unseemingly,
[1:15:47] leaving the natural use of the woman,
[1:15:50] man with man, woman with woman, doing
[1:15:52] those things which are unseemingly.
[1:15:57] actually describing
[1:16:00] the condition of people that reject the
[1:16:04] truth.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; That's what happens. He's the god of
[1:16:12] this evil age.
[1:16:16] He's the he he it spirits
[1:16:20] o of deceit.
[1:16:24] So I I Satan just putting tons
[1:16:29] of financial pressure
[1:16:33] on the believer.
[1:16:38] But you know something, if you're a
[1:16:40] believer,
[1:16:44] that's what it comes down to.
[1:16:46] because he said, "If you're a you don't
[1:16:49] confess me before men,
[1:16:54] I'll not confess you before my father."
[1:17:00] Now, it's hard in this day when you
[1:17:03] confess somebody you're saying, "I
[1:17:07] believe what he's saying to be the
[1:17:10] truth."
[1:17:12] My confession is his confession. He said
[1:17:16] that a righteous man should not break
[1:17:18] bread.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Now that's something when you start
[1:17:23] confessing that
[1:17:26] he said look at the little sparrows
[1:17:28] which are the scriptures right before
[1:17:30] those. He doesn't sow. He doesn't heal.
[1:17:33] Yet his father in heaven takes care of
[1:17:36] him. How much greater are you than them?
[1:17:43] Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look at the liies of the
[1:17:47] field. They neither toil nor or nor or
[1:17:50] sow,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; but yet they're they're afraid. Their
[1:17:55] their glory is even greater than that of
[1:17:57] the the kingdom of Solomon."
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; What's he trying to get to us? He's
[1:18:04] trying to break the deception that is
[1:18:08] sitting in our minds that Satan has been
[1:18:11] sewing out there trying to keep us from
[1:18:15] putting the mind of Christ in our mind.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you that was in
[1:18:22] Christ Jesus.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to keep from the
[1:18:27] church.
[1:18:31] He's trying to keep the mind of God's
[1:18:34] word from the church by offering
[1:18:38] deceptions.
[1:18:42] Now, there's nothing worse
[1:18:45] than deception. I I I was talking with
[1:18:48] brother Tim. I said, "You sure there's a
[1:18:50] way out of here?"
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine him building a maze with
[1:18:57] no way out?
[1:19:01] Once you get in, you're trapped
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; because he put one wrong turn up
[1:19:11] or one barrier and you got in
[1:19:16] and there's no way out.
[1:19:22] That's the devil.
[1:19:27] That's what he's done. He's got people
[1:19:30] to a place where there's no way out.
[1:19:34] And then he convinces them that their
[1:19:36] problems are so great and so bad and so
[1:19:41] deep that there's no way out.
[1:19:46] But yet we know there's a way out
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; because the scripture tells us the truth
[1:19:52] is what sets you free.
[1:19:55] The truth is what sets you free.
[1:20:00] And so we are in the most deceptful,
[1:20:05] evil age there's ever been.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; In fact, we are living in Satan's Eden.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; God created his Eden 2,000 years ago. No
[1:20:19] death, no sickness, no graves.
[1:20:25] No mental problems,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; nothing.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It was perfect.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; He would come down in the cool of the
[1:20:35] evening and walk with them.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; But the deceiver came,
[1:20:44] begile Eve into
[1:20:47] putting a different thought
[1:20:51] in her mind. other than the word of God,
[1:20:56] a different way of thinking. Now, let me
[1:20:58] tell you something. And I'm not against
[1:21:00] ignorance and I'm not against school,
[1:21:02] but don't you let them put thinking in
[1:21:05] your mind that leaves God out of the
[1:21:08] picture.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Because all they're trying to put you is
[1:21:16] make you a society servant
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; to serve them so they can get richer,
[1:21:21] they can have more money, they can have
[1:21:24] more power. And who is their God? Who is
[1:21:27] their leader? Who who is the prince of
[1:21:30] this world? It is the devil.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And people don't even think there's a
[1:21:38] devil anymore.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; They they you have no idea when you wake
[1:21:44] up that somebody while you were sleeping
[1:21:47] was plotting all night h how to do
[1:21:51] something to hurt you.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:22:01] Well, either you're going to believe
[1:22:03] this
[1:22:05] or you're not.
[1:22:09] It comes down to the word of God.
[1:22:15] To them that believe,
[1:22:18] it's life.
[1:22:20] To them that don't believe, it's death.
[1:22:27] But c how long does man have to go?
[1:22:34] How much fruit
[1:22:36] of evil
[1:22:39] do they have to reap
[1:22:43] until they realize, "Hey, this isn't
[1:22:46] working."
[1:22:52] You think education's done anything
[1:22:56] for our country?
[1:22:59] Yeah. We are so smart in the United
[1:23:01] States. We have finally come to the fact
[1:23:04] that we don't know what a man is or what
[1:23:07] a woman is.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; That's brilliance.
[1:23:19] That's nuts.
[1:23:27] Yeah. Somebody's running for office.
[1:23:30] They're going to have
[1:23:33] free housing, free food,
[1:23:36] free transportation.
[1:23:42] Well, who doesn't want to have free
[1:23:44] everything?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; The only thing that's free was paid for.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; There's nothing free.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; But deception,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; lies are free.
[1:24:07] Truth
[1:24:09] changes things. The acceptance of truth
[1:24:14] causes separation.
[1:24:18] The acceptance of truth when you face
[1:24:20] the truth of the matter.
[1:24:25] You got to separate yourself from the
[1:24:28] lie.
[1:24:35] It's just it's just what it is because
[1:24:38] truth set you free from the deception.
[1:24:41] That's why father was going to be
[1:24:43] against
[1:24:45] son and mother against daughter
[1:24:49] because they accepted different truths.
[1:24:54] They're looking through different
[1:24:55] eyelasses.
[1:24:58] Could you imagine in Israel when a
[1:25:01] daughter come in and her father is the
[1:25:04] rabbi
[1:25:07] steeped in the law
[1:25:10] in every traditions she's brought up
[1:25:14] just like
[1:25:16] just to be so obedient and to do
[1:25:20] everything and to wash the pans and
[1:25:22] everything. And one day she comes in,
[1:25:25] she says, "I believe that Jesus Christ
[1:25:27] is the Messiah."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; You think that was fun?
[1:25:41] I'm not going to go down there to that
[1:25:43] temple.
[1:25:46] I'm going to go over and listen to Peter
[1:25:49] speak.
[1:25:51] That was heresy. That was blasphemy.
[1:25:55] They were expelled. They were kicked
[1:25:57] out.
[1:26:00] I'll tell you, if you ever get a chance,
[1:26:04] get Sister Abby to tell you her
[1:26:06] testimony.
[1:26:13] I'll tell a little bit for you. I don't
[1:26:15] know if you're here. Sister Abby, are
[1:26:16] you here?
[1:26:18] Oh, good. She's not here.
[1:26:24] Gives me a little freedom, doesn't it?
[1:26:27] She didn't want to cut her hair.
[1:26:32] She's a teenager.
[1:26:35] She heard the gospel.
[1:26:38] God put it on her heart not to cut her
[1:26:41] hair.
[1:26:42] She comes from an Indian culture
[1:26:46] where obedience to your father
[1:26:50] and so she wouldn't cut her hair
[1:26:53] and all her her father's friends and the
[1:26:57] church and everybody called her
[1:27:00] rebellions.
[1:27:05] But she found a truth.
[1:27:07] You know what she had? She had a
[1:27:09] revelation.
[1:27:13] Her eyes were opened up that a woman
[1:27:15] shouldn't cut her hair
[1:27:18] and she believed it.
[1:27:24] And she was beaten.
[1:27:28] Not spanked.
[1:27:31] She was beaten.
[1:27:36] taken out and
[1:27:40] beaten
[1:27:42] with, I believe, a stick or some rod
[1:27:47] of some sort.
[1:27:51] And I remember when she told me, she
[1:27:53] said, "You know, the most
[1:27:56] thing I couldn't believe."
[1:27:59] She said, "All the time my father was
[1:28:02] beating me, alls I could feel in my
[1:28:06] heart was love for him."
[1:28:13] That's what the word of God does. when
[1:28:17] your eyes are opened
[1:28:21] and you see what is at stake.
[1:28:29] So we're here we are
[1:28:32] in the most decept
[1:28:36] there ever was.
[1:28:40] I know so many people think this
[1:28:43] president's so great. This president is
[1:28:45] a devil like every other president
[1:28:49] in this world is.
[1:28:53] He is not leading us closer to the Lord
[1:28:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; In fact, the truth of the matter is
[1:29:03] they're all turning to Christianity.
[1:29:07] They're all saying, "But it's not the
[1:29:09] real word of God. It's not real
[1:29:11] Christianity. It's not really the faith.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; It's It's not It It isn't. Again, I just
[1:29:24] sit there and they and here they are.
[1:29:26] Their their hair is all bobbed off and
[1:29:28] they got all kinds of stuff on, you
[1:29:31] know, whatever it is. And and you know,
[1:29:34] the scripture says a woman shouldn't cut
[1:29:36] her hair. She should be silent in its
[1:29:38] objection to her husband. And you know,
[1:29:41] they're right out there and they just
[1:29:43] breathe the name of Jesus.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:29:50] Oh, we're the ones. We've got Jesus.
[1:29:53] Vote Republican. Jesus is a Republican.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Well, don't you get that in your head?
[1:30:07] There is no truth in politics.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It is a deception.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; It causes people to hate one another.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; The fruit of its hate.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; They'll use race car, they'll use
[1:30:23] economics, they'll use everything,
[1:30:29] anything.
[1:30:32] But we are not of this world.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; We are not a religion.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; We are a people.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; We are the offspring
[1:30:51] of our father in heaven.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Who put our names on the lamb's book of
[1:30:57] life before the foundation of the world.
[1:31:02] We we're we're not believing something
[1:31:06] that's going to get us there. We've had
[1:31:09] a revelation
[1:31:11] that we're not of this kingdom.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; We're not in this evil age. And we're
[1:31:19] not subject to the powers and the
[1:31:23] spirits and the demons of this evil age.
[1:31:27] We are called out. We're elected. We're
[1:31:30] chosen. We're different.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; That might be easier for me. Like I
[1:31:40] said, when I grew up, we had three
[1:31:42] television channels.
[1:31:47] Well, you'd go crazy.
[1:31:54] ABC,
[1:31:56] NBC, and CBS.
[1:32:00] If you ever go down and visit Johnson
[1:32:03] Ranch outside of Austin, what I forget
[1:32:06] what president of the number he was.
[1:32:13] He had three televisions
[1:32:17] because that's where every bit of
[1:32:19] information came from.
[1:32:22] Now you poor young people,
[1:32:26] you've got so much deception,
[1:32:32] so much confusion
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; coming your way, so much fear put on
[1:32:40] you.
[1:32:43] And all they in every bit of it, all
[1:32:46] it's trying to do is all what modernism
[1:32:49] does is it makes old fashion.
[1:32:56] Just trying to turn us into old
[1:32:58] antiques.
[1:33:04] You're just an antique,
[1:33:09] you know,
[1:33:11] some sort of old school. That ain't the
[1:33:14] way the gospel is preached anymore.
[1:33:18] Now it's modern.
[1:33:20] You know what I mean? That's just, you
[1:33:22] know, to sing down at the cross. Who
[1:33:24] sings down at the cross anymore?
[1:33:28] You know, give me holy water.
[1:33:33] You ought to hear some of this rock and
[1:33:35] roll Christian stuff that's out there.
[1:33:40] It It's demonic,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; you know. Oh, but the words are so good
[1:33:49] and the beat is so fine. Who do you
[1:33:53] think runs music?
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It's a deception.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; You understand? You understand what you
[1:33:59] young people have got to do? You've got
[1:34:02] one time in your life. I like the way
[1:34:03] the prophet of God put it. He put it
[1:34:06] like this. He said, he's talking about
[1:34:09] deception. He says, "Last week in
[1:34:12] Matthew 24, it was almost the most
[1:34:15] deceiving age of all ages." All the ages
[1:34:18] of deceit from the Garden of Eden all
[1:34:22] the way down. There's never been an age
[1:34:24] as deceitful as this age.
[1:34:28] You understand? the whole age,
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; everything is lying to you.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; It's trying to make you servants of
[1:34:38] their fashion, servants of their
[1:34:41] products, buyers of their things.
[1:34:49] You know, they're always trying to get
[1:34:52] there's something out there that's going
[1:34:54] to make your heart work better. It's
[1:34:56] going to make your hair grow. It's going
[1:34:58] to make the wrinkles get out of your
[1:35:00] face. You know what I mean? Lie, lie,
[1:35:05] lie.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; They don't work.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; It's vanity.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Put something on you that stretches your
[1:35:20] skin. You know, it dries you up and you
[1:35:22] up,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; right? But when you wash it off, you've
[1:35:28] stretched that skin
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; and now it starts to flop all of it.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Remember the scripture says, the answer
[1:35:39] says the latter state is worse than the
[1:35:43] first state.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; They'll give you pills to give you calm
[1:35:54] you down and comfort. And if you're
[1:35:57] you're bipolar,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; well, if you ever get born again
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; and you take the word of God as your
[1:36:08] absolute,
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; then you you don't worry about the lie.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; But you want to know what bipolar is?
[1:36:17] It's a spirit over here and spirits over
[1:36:20] here.
[1:36:22] Yeah,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; this one's talking to you and you don't
[1:36:25] know whether it's truth or not. And this
[1:36:27] one's talking to you. Your conscience is
[1:36:29] talking to you. The psychiatrist says,
[1:36:32] "Well, what you need to do is get rid of
[1:36:34] your conscience.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Take this, take that. You'll get rid of
[1:36:43] your conscience. You won't have that
[1:36:44] spirit bothering you no more that tells
[1:36:47] you you need to change. that the world's
[1:36:51] lying to you, that it's a big deception.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Here, lay on the couch and I'll and and
[1:36:58] tell me
[1:37:00] what did your daddy do to you.
[1:37:06] It's not daddy. It's not mommy. It's the
[1:37:10] devil.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to mess you up.
[1:37:20] It's what he does.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what he does.
[1:37:27] How come 50% of marriages in the United
[1:37:31] States fail?
[1:37:36] Because a girl thinks this is Prince
[1:37:38] Charming.
[1:37:41] He's the one,
[1:37:44] you know, when he's got a forkid tongue.
[1:37:48] And guess what? When you start to get
[1:37:50] together, it's it's not what you thought
[1:37:52] it was.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; It's not This isn't the way it was in my
[1:37:58] romance novel.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; No, it's a lie.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that can really
[1:38:08] make a marriage work in this day is
[1:38:10] that's two people that love this word.
[1:38:14] And when they have when they have
[1:38:16] conflict, they go to prayer,
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; they they they take the Christian side.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Husbands, be not angry with your wives,
[1:38:27] for they are the weaker vessels.
[1:38:30] Husbands, love your wives as Christ
[1:38:32] loved the church and gave his life for
[1:38:34] him.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; You know what about Okay, I'm sorry. If
[1:38:38] you want to go that, fine. No problem.
[1:38:40] Go ahead, dear.
[1:38:47] You know,
[1:38:49] if they're a Christian, they'll come to
[1:38:50] the realization. Their eyes will be
[1:38:53] open. They'll understand.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; If their spirit's not right, you've got
[1:38:58] the Holy Spirit working on your behalf.
[1:39:01] Say, "Father, we we're we're on some
[1:39:03] ground here. I need your help."
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; He's the best marriage counselor in the
[1:39:09] world.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit
[1:39:14] A
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; lot of people come in my office, we sit
[1:39:16] down, what are you going to talk about?
[1:39:17] Right? You know what it always gets back
[1:39:19] to
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; It always gets back to one of the two
[1:39:27] parties is not being a Christian.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I think the wall ought to be
[1:39:37] yellow.
[1:39:40] Well, I don't like yellow.
[1:39:43] Wait a minute. If your wife wants a
[1:39:45] yellow wall, paint it yellow.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; She's there all the time.
[1:39:52] Forget it. You can live with that.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:40:00] I don't feel like I'm in control.
[1:40:04] Let him be in control.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Let him do it. That's right.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; It works.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I I'll be honest with you. You can't me
[1:40:17] I don't even think me and Leslie have
[1:40:18] had two fights in our life. You say,
[1:40:22] "Why not?" Because she won't fight.
[1:40:31] If if the temperature starts to rise
[1:40:33] off, she goes,
[1:40:36] "I go in to see." And there she is on
[1:40:38] her in her chair reading her Bible.
[1:40:42] I think I'm not going to deal with this.
[1:40:46] You know, I mean, she done bypass me.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; She went to the top.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And I know any minute now, I'm going to
[1:40:56] get my orders.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; My eyes are going to be opened. And I'm
[1:41:00] going to realize what a dunce I was and
[1:41:03] and how out of place I was and and how
[1:41:06] that I needed to be in prayer and I need
[1:41:09] to say I'm sorry. You know what I mean?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; There's no need for it.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; You know why it is people fall for the
[1:41:16] deception?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; The women want more life. They want more
[1:41:20] this. They want more of that. It's a
[1:41:22] lie.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; It's a lie.
[1:41:30] So until our eyes recognize the day that
[1:41:34] we're living in and its message and that
[1:41:37] we're living in a deceitful age
[1:41:42] will have problems
[1:41:45] and young people, you're trying to
[1:41:47] navigate this world and all these
[1:41:50] voices.
[1:41:52] It's not till you realize these voices
[1:41:55] are lying to you.
[1:42:01] They're lying to you.
[1:42:05] You know, to think that everybody's got
[1:42:07] to be skinny is a lie.
[1:42:10] I'll guarantee you when we get to
[1:42:12] heaven, there's not going to be a person
[1:42:14] up there under 300 lb.
[1:42:18] Wouldn't
[1:42:20] that blow this world to pieces?
[1:42:26] All jolly and round and happy.
[1:42:30] Just walking through the garden, eating
[1:42:32] the fruit, you know, just whoa,
[1:42:35] beautiful. How are you, brother? Fine.
[1:42:39] [Applause]
[1:42:44] It's a lie.
[1:42:47] It's a lie.
[1:42:52] I'm on every live longer drug and
[1:42:54] program there is.
[1:42:57] And when I come to my appointed time,
[1:43:00] when God's decided and knew in advance
[1:43:03] he's going to take me, I'm going to hold
[1:43:06] up all these bottles
[1:43:08] and I'm saying, "I took all this stuff,
[1:43:10] Lord.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You can't take me.
[1:43:20] I took super beats.
[1:43:24] I took collagen.
[1:43:28] I took this and that. But you want to
[1:43:30] know something? If God wants to take
[1:43:32] you, there's not enough hospitals and
[1:43:36] doctors and pills to keep you here.
[1:43:40] But if God wants you here, there's not
[1:43:42] enough sicknesses or devils or or things
[1:43:46] to take you.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; We've got to start facing the deception.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; And recognize the deception. As I was
[1:43:59] reading, he says,
[1:44:02] he says, "Hey, evil, it's impossible
[1:44:05] deceive."
[1:44:07] He said, "False prophets will rise up,
[1:44:10] show signs and wonders if possible to
[1:44:13] deceive the very elect."
[1:44:17] See, now just a cold, formal, starchy
[1:44:21] church and so forth, a man-made theology
[1:44:24] that wouldn't the elect wouldn't pay no
[1:44:28] attention to that. But it's up there
[1:44:32] almost like the real thing.
[1:44:38] Science, education, almost up there like
[1:44:42] the real thing. Just leave one word is
[1:44:45] all you have to do. Promised
[1:44:48] of the age.
[1:44:51] Just leave off one word
[1:44:54] that was due. You know what one of the
[1:44:56] promises of this age is? Is the
[1:44:59] revelation of the son of predition.
[1:45:05] The eyeopening
[1:45:07] of the believer
[1:45:09] in revelations 3:14. I shall give you
[1:45:13] eyes that thou mayest see.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; That is a promise of this age that you
[1:45:22] will see the deception.
[1:45:29] You can't navigate through darkness and
[1:45:32] lies and and false advertisement and
[1:45:37] what your websites are. There's a
[1:45:39] website now I was reading about that you
[1:45:43] can send your picture
[1:45:46] and they'll grade you
[1:45:50] whether you're a 10 or a seven or a five
[1:45:53] or a six.
[1:45:59] That's nuts.
[1:46:02] And then they'll say, "What are you?"
[1:46:05] Well,
[1:46:07] I'm I'm only a five.
[1:46:11] In whose eyes?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; In whose eyes?
[1:46:18] I might be an ugly as a mud fence in
[1:46:21] this world, but the Bible tells me I'm
[1:46:23] glorious in his sight.
[1:46:29] My beauty is in my nature.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Why have a beautiful body that's going
[1:46:36] to be destroyed by worms?
[1:46:40] The worms that's in you.
[1:46:43] It's not what God's getting. That's not
[1:46:45] what last. I'm going to get my new 300
[1:46:49] pound body when I get over there.
[1:46:53] But until you face the deception,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; until you start realizing that all this
[1:47:00] social media, all this music, all this
[1:47:03] boyfriend, girlfriend junk that goes on,
[1:47:07] all that worrying about a mate and all
[1:47:10] worrying about your future is nothing
[1:47:13] but the stress
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; and the spirits of this world trying to
[1:47:18] destroy your soul.
[1:47:22] and that Jesus Christ is the answer.
[1:47:26] And when you accept the truth of his
[1:47:29] age, for this age, that God sent you
[1:47:32] something to guide you through this
[1:47:35] deception, when you can accept that with
[1:47:38] all your heart and lean to it, you will
[1:47:41] find out that it will provide a path of
[1:47:44] light to you, a peace to you, a joy to
[1:47:48] you, a comfort to you. And you find out
[1:47:51] that he's got a mate for you. He's got a
[1:47:54] place for you. He's got a will for you.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; But until you withstand Satan,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; he won't flee.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; But once you call him out,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; once you say you're not going to lie to
[1:48:14] me,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; and you know what he is,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; and he's exposed,
[1:48:24] He don't come into your house
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; no more.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; But as I was reading, he says, he said,
[1:48:34] not some man-made theology that wouldn't
[1:48:38] the elect wouldn't never pay no
[1:48:40] attention to that, but it's there's
[1:48:42] almost something real thing. Just leave
[1:48:46] out one word you have to do. Promise to
[1:48:49] this age. It's a very great time,
[1:48:52] Christians everywhere. Take heed
[1:48:56] to the hour we're living. Mark down and
[1:49:02] read and listen close.
[1:49:06] Mark it down.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; What's happening to young people?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; You know how many young people deaths
[1:49:15] there are now?
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; What? the other day a homecoming, right?
[1:49:21] 14 people in
[1:49:26] a young man that was in one of our young
[1:49:28] people's services.
[1:49:31] A loving dad trying to get him at
[1:49:33] Christian fellowship. His heart trying
[1:49:35] to turn towards the Lord, trying to make
[1:49:37] a move from God, trying to get out of
[1:49:39] the world of deception.
[1:49:41] Shot dead.
[1:49:45] They're shooting themselves to death out
[1:49:48] there.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; You call that life?
[1:49:52] You call that the world?
[1:49:57] They're bullying one another, shaming
[1:49:59] one another, making people feel
[1:50:04] little and distraught. They're taking
[1:50:07] drugs by the thing. Look at the Look at
[1:50:10] them. They're drunk driving deaths.
[1:50:12] Teenagers crashing on the road. get
[1:50:15] getting drunk. Look at the fruits.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Look at Look at the deception. It isn't
[1:50:22] a great glorious life.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Teenage suicides are higher than they've
[1:50:31] ever been.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:50:34] Because they're buying into the
[1:50:37] deception.
[1:50:39] Don't buy into the deception.
[1:50:43] You look in the mirror and think, just
[1:50:45] think, God made me.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; God made me.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; I like that little thing that they used
[1:50:54] to wear. The kids used to wear it. I
[1:50:57] thought it was kind of good. He said,
[1:50:58] "God don't make junk."
[1:51:03] Now, I don't know what Max Factor
[1:51:06] wants to do.
[1:51:09] I mean, one day you're if you got big
[1:51:12] lips and next day you did skinny lips
[1:51:15] and you got big eyebrows and then skinny
[1:51:18] eyebrows and long lashes then short
[1:51:22] lashes.
[1:51:24] What are they doing? They're just
[1:51:25] stealing your money.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said dish soap was
[1:51:30] the biggest fraud around. you know, just
[1:51:32] took two squirts. And they show the
[1:51:35] little remember that that commercial
[1:51:36] that little soap goes down there and
[1:51:38] works its way over to your dishes and
[1:51:41] all of a sudden all the dirt falls off
[1:51:43] your dishes and everything and oh my.
[1:51:48] He says, "Honey, I'm going to wash the
[1:51:50] dishes."
[1:51:52] He gets a pan full of water and he goes
[1:51:55] squirt squirt and walks in there and
[1:51:58] sits down. She says, "I thought you were
[1:52:00] going to wash the dishes."
[1:52:03] They're being washed.
[1:52:07] You know
[1:52:09] lie.
[1:52:14] Just a lie.
[1:52:18] And you know he goes back and that stuff
[1:52:19] didn't do nothing.
[1:52:25] Guess what he had to do.
[1:52:36] had to wash dishes.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; You know how you wash dishes? You wash
[1:52:41] dishes.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; You know what we do? We add a
[1:52:45] dishwasher.
[1:52:46] We wash the dishes before we put them in
[1:52:49] the dishwasher.
[1:52:56] Leslie, some a a lady comes helps Leslie
[1:53:00] clean the house every couple weeks. What
[1:53:03] do you think she does before she comes?
[1:53:05] She cleans the house. I said, "What are
[1:53:08] you doing?" "Well, I'm my housekeeper's
[1:53:10] coming tomorrow." "Well, let her do it.
[1:53:13] Let her clean it."
[1:53:16] I spilled crumbs on the floor. I say,
[1:53:18] "She'll be here next week.
[1:53:21] That's her job.
[1:53:27] What I'm trying to point to is our minds
[1:53:30] are way out of whack.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; There's too much stuff in our minds, too
[1:53:34] much thinking, too much garbage. We need
[1:53:37] to come back to God's word.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Back to being a Christian.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to close now. I never did
[1:53:50] get to what I was preaching.
[1:53:52] So
[1:53:54] most deceptive age, why did he put you
[1:53:58] here
[1:54:00] in the most deceptive age?
[1:54:05] Why is he going to call out a people for
[1:54:09] his name's sake
[1:54:12] in the most deceptive age there ever
[1:54:15] was?
[1:54:17] Now, this is what I hope I can get to to
[1:54:21] especially teenagers and you in your
[1:54:24] early 20s and that are going through all
[1:54:27] these things. Why me? Why now?
[1:54:35] Why do I got to put up with all this?
[1:54:37] Why is my mind so full of so many
[1:54:42] things?
[1:54:44] Why is it so hard for me?
[1:54:50] And there's a reason.
[1:54:52] And when you can see the deception
[1:54:56] and then see the reason, when you can
[1:54:59] understand, wait here, I was put here.
[1:55:03] I I I don't know why he put me coming to
[1:55:07] him in in the late 60s,
[1:55:11] but that's the time he chose
[1:55:14] to open my eyes
[1:55:17] and to have me make a choice.
[1:55:20] He I don't know why he put you here now,
[1:55:26] but he did it.
[1:55:29] You're here.
[1:55:31] You got one choice. Believe the lie.
[1:55:36] Don't not Don't
[1:55:39] not accept the truth
[1:55:41] because of your parents.
[1:55:49] That's what he said.
[1:55:52] Well, I don't like my dad's religion. I
[1:55:54] don't like the way he yells at me. I
[1:55:56] don't like the way he enforces it. You
[1:55:58] know, I I remember when I lived in Flag
[1:56:01] and the message was first starting.
[1:56:04] Well, the the people just came to the
[1:56:06] message. Now they're taking their pants
[1:56:08] off their daughters and and you know,
[1:56:10] they're in high school and the dad's all
[1:56:12] of a sudden, you can't wear pants. And
[1:56:14] so they put on a skirt, but it's got to
[1:56:16] be a long skirt. So what do you think
[1:56:17] they're doing? They're walking down the
[1:56:19] street, going to the gas station,
[1:56:20] pinning up their skirts,
[1:56:23] going to school. School's out. They drop
[1:56:25] their skirt down and they come home and
[1:56:28] daddy's happy.
[1:56:34] Oh, he got them to abide abide by the
[1:56:37] law.
[1:56:40] They don't go out, you know, they don't
[1:56:43] they don't act like they got a boyfriend
[1:56:45] or nothing, but man, school's out.
[1:56:48] They're jumping in the car with the guy
[1:56:49] and they're going down there and they're
[1:56:51] coming back and they get back to school
[1:56:52] and they get on the bus and they come
[1:56:54] back and daddy's happy. Looks like
[1:56:57] they're doing everything just according
[1:56:59] to the rules.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; You know, daddy forgets there's a devil.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Mama forgets there a devil. As long as
[1:57:10] they making life easier for me,
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; that ain't how it works. Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; It's not until
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; that young girl comes to the place, the
[1:57:25] only reason they want me to dress in
[1:57:28] tight clothes is so they can lust after
[1:57:30] me.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; The only reason they want me to wear
[1:57:35] high heels is so my body moves in a way
[1:57:37] that they can lust after me. They can
[1:57:40] look at me. They can see my form and
[1:57:43] commit adultery with it.
[1:57:46] When you realize that's the truth,
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; when you realize that guy that's trying
[1:57:51] to talk to you and kiss you and take you
[1:57:54] out on a date, he's got one thing on his
[1:57:56] mind,
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; and that's to steal your innocence from
[1:58:02] you.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; He's an animal.
[1:58:10] If he's not born again
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit is not controlling
[1:58:15] his appetite, he's after you for one
[1:58:18] reason.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; And that's the gospel
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; and that's the truth.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; And I don't care how you butter it up.
[1:58:29] They can sit right in this church. If
[1:58:32] they're not born again, they're still
[1:58:34] after your body.
[1:58:41] and that's all.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; All they do is just keep feeding you and
[1:58:52] leading you. You know what the Bible
[1:58:54] calls it? Seduction.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; You got to face that.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; We can't pretend like it don't exist.
[1:59:11] You just can't pretend.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; You got to get back to reality.
[1:59:20] Revelation
[1:59:22] is reality.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; They try to make revelation intellectual
[1:59:27] faith,
[1:59:30] but revelation is Isaav. And I give you
[1:59:34] Isaav that thou mayest see. Hallelujah.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Revelation of God's word is saf.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It lets you realize this depression
[1:59:45] devil has no right in my life.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; This this negativity has no right in my
[1:59:51] life.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; He that is in me is greater than he who
[1:59:55] is in the world. I am not going to let
[1:59:57] this thing rule my life. I am not going
[1:59:59] to have my happiness taken. I am going
[2:00:02] to be content in whatever state I am.
[2:00:05] God's my maker. He controls my life.
[2:00:08] He's the fountain of my blessing. I
[2:00:11] don't need Satan in my life.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; And all the time he's appearing as an
[2:00:21] angel of light.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I'll guide you
[2:00:26] right to hell,
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; to misery,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; to depression,
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; to divorce.
[2:00:39] That's where he goes.
[2:00:42] We let the law of the message start
[2:00:46] ruling our lives instead of the spirit
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; of God's word.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; He came to to us to guide us in spirit
[2:00:54] and truth.
[2:01:00] Now, why
[2:01:04] God had a reason for letting it get as
[2:01:08] bad as it is?
[2:01:12] And it's ugly,
[2:01:15] brother Jerome. Do you ever think it
[2:01:16] could get this ugly?
[2:01:19] Do you ever think people could hate one
[2:01:20] another the way they hate one another
[2:01:22] today?
[2:01:26] I mean, can you imagine how bad it is?
[2:01:28] People don't like one another because of
[2:01:30] the color of their skin.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's pathetic.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; People have complexes.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; God didn't make me Hispanic, but if he
[2:01:51] make me a Hispanic, I'd be one proud
[2:01:53] Hispanic ombre.
[2:01:58] much. Gracias.
[2:02:00] Hallelujah.
[2:02:02] Glory. Adios.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; I'd be so Mexican you couldn't believe
[2:02:09] it. I'd drive a Chevy.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:22] If God made me in India, man, I'd cook
[2:02:25] the hottest stuff known to mankind.
[2:02:30] I'd put it on fire.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; And we'd eat rice. Oo, we'd eat lots of
[2:02:35] rice.
[2:02:40] And if I was a a born a black American,
[2:02:43] I'd speak Ebonics. What up?
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave anybody out.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I just do the jig cuz I'm Irish.
[2:03:03] Our glory is in Christ Jesus.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Our glory is that he gave us the word of
[2:03:09] God. Our glory is that we believe the
[2:03:11] same truth, the same that we're elected,
[2:03:15] we're chosen, we're called out, we're
[2:03:18] part of something greater.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Not all this stuff, this deception.
[2:03:35] He's calling not a church group, but a
[2:03:39] people
[2:03:41] for his name.
[2:03:44] That's why we're a people. We're not a
[2:03:46] religion. We're fitted and joined
[2:03:50] together with the same seed of our
[2:03:53] father in us.
[2:03:57] Our natural seed came from the father
[2:03:59] that produced this flesh.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; But I have another seed. that came from
[2:04:06] my real father.
[2:04:10] That seed is we've all have that same
[2:04:13] seed.
[2:04:16] I love going someplace and and what the
[2:04:19] brothers are saying. This is my brother
[2:04:21] and this is my brother. Your natural
[2:04:23] brother. Yeah.
[2:04:26] This is my real brother
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; from my real father
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; from the beginning.
[2:04:37] This is real.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; What we have, this kinship
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; is real.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Because we had a kinsman redeemer.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; It's not fake.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; But so that's why he's calling a people.
[2:04:55] He said
[2:04:58] a people for his name that receive his
[2:05:01] name.
[2:05:04] Now listen.
[2:05:06] Engaged in his name,
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; going to a wedding to be married to him
[2:05:19] to become part of him by predestination.
[2:05:25] Just as a man that chooses the right
[2:05:27] wife in life was ordained to be part of
[2:05:31] his body, so is the bride of Christ will
[2:05:36] be and now is from old ordained
[2:05:41] by God to be a part of the body. See,
[2:05:45] oh, the scriptures are so rich, full of
[2:05:48] honey. You see, when you see the
[2:05:50] deception, you say, "Wait a minute. I'm
[2:05:54] not part of this world.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; I'm called to be take his name.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; I'm in spouse to Jesus Christ. This is
[2:06:04] my husband.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; That's who's got my life. I'm going to
[2:06:11] take on his name.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Some of you might know Leslie's maiden
[2:06:18] name.
[2:06:21] probably a lot of you don't.
[2:06:25] She she didn't remain Lesie Fay Pepe.
[2:06:34] Now, we always argue whether that's
[2:06:36] Polish or Hungarian,
[2:06:39] but she said, "We found out it's
[2:06:40] Hungarian."
[2:06:44] She gave up that name. She took my name.
[2:06:51] We give up our identity
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; We give up. I'm not taking him, Satan,
[2:07:00] as my husband and my world and my
[2:07:03] provider and my head and my leader.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; We just didn't divorce Satan. We died to
[2:07:15] him.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:19] But until you see his deception
[2:07:23] and accept Jesus for your his name's
[2:07:26] sake, you're under the headship of the
[2:07:30] deception.
[2:07:31] The deception is what's running your
[2:07:34] life.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; And it's till you stop back and say,
[2:07:39] "I'm not going to be deceived no more.
[2:07:43] Oh, sin is pleasurable
[2:07:46] for a season.
[2:07:49] Everybody was cool in high school. All
[2:07:52] my buddies, we did everything together.
[2:07:56] We did things we shouldn't do together.
[2:07:58] We raced cars down the street together.
[2:08:01] We drank together. We did everything
[2:08:05] together.
[2:08:07] Five years after I got out of high
[2:08:08] school, I didn't know where one of them
[2:08:10] was.
[2:08:13] because that wasn't life.
[2:08:26] See, just like as a man chooses the
[2:08:29] right wife in life was ordained to be
[2:08:32] part of body, so is the bride of Christ
[2:08:34] will be and now ordained to be a part of
[2:08:37] the body. You see how scriptures are so
[2:08:41] full of honey. He he says
[2:08:48] then he goes on to say
[2:08:50] he says now we find out in this evil age
[2:08:55] is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; that she is not that type of woman and
[2:09:04] she will be tried by his word the bride
[2:09:09] as Adam's bride was tried by the word.
[2:09:13] And Adam's bride believed every bit of
[2:09:15] the word. All all but confused
[2:09:20] on one promise
[2:09:23] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:09:26] forever. Today, by failing on one
[2:09:31] promise under the temptation of the
[2:09:34] enemy face to face. And now the people
[2:09:38] that's called for his name, of course,
[2:09:41] his bride, she has come in contact again
[2:09:46] with the same thing. Not by just
[2:09:49] denominational truth or something else,
[2:09:52] by by every word.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; You were put here to come in contact
[2:09:58] with the same deception.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Satan gave it to her in seed form. Now
[2:10:06] you're facing it in fruit form.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; There's his Eden. There's his world.
[2:10:13] There his deception.
[2:10:16] Get rich, you'll be happy.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; No. Get Christ,
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; you'll be happy.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Marry him
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; and he'll provide for you.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Put your life into his hands. Since when
[2:10:35] did we start measuring the church by
[2:10:37] prosperity?
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; He came to the poor in this world rich
[2:10:42] in faith.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; I believe every word of God. I believe
[2:10:49] what Jesus said. I believe what Jesus
[2:10:51] promised young people, teenagers, young
[2:10:55] women, men that want to get married,
[2:11:00] you can believe them.
[2:11:04] You were put here in the greatest
[2:11:06] testing hour ever.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; You have to face the lie of this age.
[2:11:14] Just like the church,
[2:11:17] just like Eve had to face the lie. We
[2:11:21] have to face the God of this evil age
[2:11:26] and tell him what he is. He's the liar.
[2:11:31] He's the father of lies. And there's no
[2:11:34] truth in them.
[2:11:40] And this is the truth.
[2:11:43] Nothing but the truth.
[2:11:45] And this will lead you into all
[2:11:48] righteousness.
[2:11:49] And it'll lead you into eternal life.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't make it on my
[2:11:57] own." He said, "I'll help you.
[2:12:00] I'll come again and I'll be with you
[2:12:03] even in you.
[2:12:06] You say, "Lord, I'm fighting a lot of
[2:12:07] things. I know it's wrong.
[2:12:11] Ask and you shall receive. Father, give
[2:12:15] me your Holy Spirit.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Give me the power to overcome.
[2:12:22] Give me eyes that I might see, that I
[2:12:26] can be truly born again."
[2:12:28] You made mistakes in the past.
[2:12:32] He's just and faithful to forgive. His
[2:12:37] truth has not changed.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; It's still there. It's been there since
[2:12:43] the beginning. Nothing's changed. But
[2:12:47] the deception
[2:12:49] around us is getting bigger and darker
[2:12:54] and more evil.
[2:12:56] And it's trying to make the word of God
[2:12:59] of none effect, but it's still true. And
[2:13:03] you can stand on every promise of God's
[2:13:07] word. And God promised if you take that
[2:13:10] promise, in no wise will he turn you
[2:13:13] out.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Satan says he will. I say he won't.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; You want deliverance? God said he'll
[2:13:22] deliver you.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Satan says he won't.
[2:13:26] Who do you believe? Why halt you between
[2:13:30] two opinions? As for me and my house,
[2:13:34] we'll serve the Lord.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Don't go down that road.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; There's There's nothing in it.
[2:13:47] There's nothing in the world for us
[2:13:50] but heartache,
[2:13:53] death.
[2:13:55] But what does Christ have for us?
[2:13:58] Another kingdom,
[2:14:00] another body, and life eternal. God
[2:14:04] bless you. Let's stand this morning.
[2:14:08] Musicians come and
[2:14:28] when you read the Bible and you come to
[2:14:31] the Lady of Age
[2:14:34] and Jesus counseledled them.
[2:14:40] It's amazing. You would think he would
[2:14:44] counsel you to
[2:14:48] go
[2:14:49] have an experience,
[2:14:53] you know,
[2:14:55] or go get endued with power from on
[2:15:00] high. You know what he counseledled them
[2:15:01] to do? buyth meth
[2:15:07] that thou mayest see
[2:15:12] that I that I may see.
[2:15:17] You got a habit. It ain't your habit.
[2:15:21] It's a spirit
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; that Satan's trying to put on you.
[2:15:29] It's all it is. You got bitterness in
[2:15:33] your heart.
[2:15:34] You don't have bitterness.
[2:15:38] You didn't grow up with bitterness.
[2:15:41] Satan put that bitterness in your heart.
[2:15:48] You got fear.
[2:15:52] You didn't come up with that fear.
[2:15:56] Satan put that fear in your heart.
[2:16:01] And why can't you finally just look at
[2:16:03] that thing and say, "I ain't going to be
[2:16:04] afraid no more.
[2:16:09] I'm not I'm not
[2:16:11] going down that road.
[2:16:14] I'm not going to doubt my marriage. I'm
[2:16:16] not going to doubt where I am in life.
[2:16:20] I'm going to convin con
[2:16:23] commit my
[2:16:26] position
[2:16:27] where I am right now into his hands. I'm
[2:16:31] going to look back and over all my
[2:16:33] decisions and all my failures because
[2:16:36] I'm sure my failures are bigger than all
[2:16:38] my successes.
[2:16:41] But I'm just going to sit right where I
[2:16:43] am right now
[2:16:45] and I'm going to say, "Lord, I don't
[2:16:47] want to go and be deceived
[2:16:50] anymore.
[2:16:54] I don't want the lies
[2:16:58] that are going on in the battle of my
[2:17:01] mind
[2:17:03] to determine
[2:17:05] my destination
[2:17:08] and my eternal life.
[2:17:13] But Lord, I'd like to receive your mind
[2:17:16] into my life.
[2:17:20] And I ask you to forgive me
[2:17:23] of my failures
[2:17:30] that
[2:17:32] the love of God might be
[2:17:35] shed abroad in my heart by the Holy
[2:17:37] Spirit.
[2:17:44] And father, I pray with all my heart
[2:17:47] that my personal prayers that you give
[2:17:50] me eyes is
[2:17:52] that I can see the deceptions
[2:17:57] that you'll go before me, Father, and
[2:17:59] reveal every trick
[2:18:02] of Satan.
[2:18:06] And when it's all said and done, Lord, I
[2:18:10] I want to commit my life into your
[2:18:12] hands.
[2:18:14] Father, I know there's a lot of years
[2:18:17] between me and
[2:18:21] many of the young people.
[2:18:26] They've grown up in technology and
[2:18:29] texting and emailing and
[2:18:32] they have a whole different world of
[2:18:35] communicating.
[2:18:39] But Father, the one thing that hasn't
[2:18:41] changed
[2:18:43] is you making contact with man.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; That contact has been the same since you
[2:18:51] met Paul on the road to Damascus.
[2:18:56] You meant me on a rooftop.
[2:18:59] Many people in here will tell you
[2:19:01] another time that
[2:19:04] you meant them.
[2:19:08] But Father, you initiated every single
[2:19:10] one of those meetings.
[2:19:14] It was your time,
[2:19:16] your place, and your will.
[2:19:21] Father, if I could give the baptism of
[2:19:23] the Holy Spirit, I'd walk down this
[2:19:25] aisle and lay my hands on him and impart
[2:19:28] that.
[2:19:30] But Father, it's not until you touch
[2:19:32] their heart
[2:19:35] and they want to walk away from the
[2:19:37] deception
[2:19:39] and they want your spirit.
[2:19:44] Father, if they make that step, I could
[2:19:46] lay my hands on them, baptize them in
[2:19:50] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:19:53] and you'd give them ISA, Father, and the
[2:19:56] whole world would become different.
[2:19:59] Everything would change.
[2:20:02] They'd feel a freedom like they've never
[2:20:04] felt before.
[2:20:07] Lord, I rebuke the depression and lies
[2:20:09] that Satan tells.
[2:20:12] And I ask that your gospel, Father, go
[2:20:15] forth in the power of the resurrection,
[2:20:18] setting minds and hearts free
[2:20:22] that they might know that you're the
[2:20:24] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:20:29] Heavenly Father, I took this path not
[2:20:32] knowing
[2:20:34] that I would go this way.
[2:20:38] But father, you know the way for you are
[2:20:41] the way.
[2:20:43] You know the truth for you are the truth
[2:20:46] and you are the life. Give us that life.
[2:20:50] We ask it in Jesus' name. Father, if
[2:20:54] there's any sick amongst us,
[2:20:57] I believe if they'd just raise your
[2:20:59] their hand to you
[2:21:02] right now and say, "Father, I'm sick.
[2:21:05] Tim's brother needs your touch. I've
[2:21:08] been hearing about a baby that needs
[2:21:10] your touch.
[2:21:12] Father, I need your touch.
[2:21:17] And I ask, Father, that this gospel
[2:21:20] truth
[2:21:22] will now be interpretated in us by those
[2:21:25] promises being manifested in the flesh.
[2:21:29] I ask these things this morning that you
[2:21:32] vindicate this word to be true. In Jesus
[2:21:35] precious name we pray.
[2:21:38] Amen.
[2:21:40] Amen. What is this song? Let's sing it.
