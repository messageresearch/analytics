[42:55] the reason we love you is
[42:58] because you first loved us
[43:03] oh such wonderful love
[43:06] we're in this great love that you have
[43:08] loved us with lord the
[43:12] very things that we've come to know that
[43:14] stir our souls and stir our hearts going
[43:18] it's given us purpose to live and reason
[43:21] of being lord
[43:23] oh i don't know where we would be
[43:25] without your great love
[43:28] we'd be lost we'd be undone we'd be in
[43:30] ruin we'd be in sin we'd be in darkness
[43:34] many of us might not even be alive today
[43:37] but the old
[43:38] blessed hand of jehovah
[43:42] that's been keeping us protecting us and
[43:46] you've brought us here to this place
[43:47] tonight
[43:49] so we're looking to the tinder hand of
[43:51] jehovah once again just to come and
[43:56] do what only you can do lord and break
[43:58] the bread of life to your people
[44:01] we surrender ourselves to you both the
[44:03] speaker and the hearer
[44:05] that you might just have the preeminence
[44:07] in this service we pray
[44:09] we love you now lord we ask all these
[44:11] things and commit it to you in the
[44:12] precious
[44:13] and wonderful name that name that's
[44:15] above all names
[44:17] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[44:18] pray
[44:20] amen hallelujah
[44:23] amen if we can go ahead and turn in our
[44:25] bibles we'll be reading out of acts
[44:26] chapter 8.
[44:33] thank you musicians
[44:39] acts chapter 8 verse 26 through 35.
[44:49] amen just pray that god would give me
[44:51] strength in my voice and
[44:53] strength and power of the holy ghost to
[44:56] deliver the burden that's upon my heart
[44:59] as we just believe together acts chapter
[45:03] 8 verse 26 through
[45:06] 35 i believe we'll be reading says in
[45:09] the angel of the lord
[45:11] spake unto philip saint arise and go
[45:14] toward the south unto the way
[45:16] that goeth down from jerusalem onto gaza
[45:20] which is desert and he arose and went
[45:23] and behold a man of ethiopia a eunuch
[45:25] of great authority under candace queen
[45:28] of
[45:28] the ethiopians who had the charge of all
[45:31] her treasures
[45:32] and had come to jerusalem for to worship
[45:35] was returning and sitting in his chariot
[45:38] read
[45:38] isaiah the prophet then the spirit of
[45:42] the lord said unto philip go near
[45:43] and join thyself to this chariot and
[45:46] philip ran thither to him
[45:49] my it just struck me just in the reading
[45:51] of scripture
[45:52] the lord spoke to philip and he ran i
[45:56] pray i pray god
[45:57] when you speak to my heart may i be
[45:59] diligent
[46:01] to to be obedient to thy word and
[46:04] fulfill it as you have spoken it
[46:06] and philip ran thither to him and heard
[46:09] him read the prophet isaiah
[46:10] and said understand us thou
[46:14] what thou readest that's a good question
[46:19] you know you can ask that question to
[46:21] the nominal
[46:22] church world we can ask that question to
[46:24] ourself
[46:26] when you listen to a tape did you
[46:29] understand what you just listened to
[46:33] let's get beyond the carnal
[46:34] understanding let's get revelation
[46:37] said understand us thou what thou
[46:39] readist and he said how can i except
[46:41] some man
[46:42] should guide me amen
[46:45] and he desired philip that he would come
[46:48] up and sit with him
[46:50] and the place of the scripture which he
[46:51] had read was this
[46:53] he was led as a sheep to the slaughter
[46:56] and like a lamb
[46:57] dumb before his shear so opened he nod
[47:00] his mouth
[47:01] in his humiliation his judgment was
[47:03] taken away and who shall declare
[47:06] his generation for his life is taken
[47:09] from the earth
[47:10] and the eunuch answered philip and said
[47:12] i pray thee
[47:14] i tell you what he was asking the right
[47:15] person
[47:18] i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet
[47:20] this of himself
[47:22] or of some other man then philip opened
[47:24] his mouth
[47:25] and began at the same scripture and
[47:28] preached
[47:29] unto him jesus amen we just had a
[47:32] blessing upon the word you may be seated
[47:43] also just want to read out of john
[47:45] chapter 1 verse 18.
[47:49] i think that's such a beautiful portion
[47:52] of scripture there
[47:53] uh phillip opened his mouth and preached
[47:56] jesus
[47:58] and and just if you keep reading there
[48:00] and philip preaching jesus they they
[48:02] ended up at the water
[48:03] that's what happens when you preach
[48:04] jesus
[48:10] in john 1 18 it says no man hath seen
[48:13] god at any time
[48:15] the only begotten son which is in the
[48:17] bosom of the father
[48:19] he hath declared him
[48:24] and i just what's on my heart and just
[48:28] reading the very
[48:29] end of that scripture
[48:34] it says no man had seen god at any time
[48:36] the only begotten son which is in the
[48:37] bosom of the father
[48:39] he hath declared him and just the burden
[48:42] that's upon my heart
[48:43] is is to say that she hath
[48:46] declared him and that would be maybe my
[48:49] the title of the sermon would be she
[48:51] have declared him and maybe
[48:52] uh just to help our minds uh in a
[48:55] certain direction maybe as a subject
[48:57] i want to say prophecy being fulfilled
[49:02] and just in reading out of the mighty
[49:04] god unveiled before us the bible said no
[49:07] man has seen god at any time
[49:09] but the only begotten of the father has
[49:11] declared him
[49:12] so moses saw him veiled as a man and we
[49:14] find that jehovah of the old testament
[49:17] was jesus of the new testament and dr
[49:20] schofield here says we find
[49:24] that his word changing from form
[49:29] we find the word in morphe in the greek
[49:31] which means
[49:32] the unseen was made visible
[49:35] we know it's there it cannot be seen but
[49:38] yet we know
[49:39] that it's there and when he changed his
[49:42] form
[49:42] for in morphe which means that he
[49:45] changed
[49:46] from supernatural to natural
[49:49] he just changed his mask and otherwise
[49:51] it's like a drama
[49:52] he was acting in the greek when they
[49:55] would change their mask maybe one play
[49:57] one player might
[49:58] have acted in several different parts my
[50:00] daughter present here they just had a
[50:02] high school drama
[50:04] and one boy that i know played out about
[50:06] four parts
[50:07] but he would go behind the stage and
[50:09] change his mask
[50:11] in order to come out to impersonate
[50:13] another character
[50:14] now if you will just take the old
[50:16] testament prophecies concerning what the
[50:18] messiah was to be
[50:20] you can compare it with the life of
[50:21] jesus and you got exactly
[50:23] who jesus was he was not just an
[50:26] ordinary man oh if i could just run with
[50:30] that a little bit and say you're not
[50:32] just an ordinary church
[50:34] you're not just an ordinary bride
[50:38] amen he was god in morphe
[50:41] he was changed from the supernatural
[50:44] into the natural form
[50:45] of a man yet he was god manifested in
[50:48] the flesh
[50:49] veiled by a human
[50:52] fleshly veil and we know in the
[50:54] scripture and in john 1
[50:56] 1 it says in the beginning was the word
[50:58] and the word was with god
[51:00] and the word was gone and as our prophet
[51:04] picks up that scripture
[51:05] he takes that word and he says you know
[51:07] that that word w-o-r-d
[51:09] actually means logos and he starts to
[51:12] show that the
[51:12] the definition of that word or logos it
[51:15] means the very
[51:16] thought or the very he got to a man that
[51:20] was in his own image
[51:22] and the prophet goes on to say that that
[51:24] but that that
[51:25] image fell that masterpiece family that
[51:28] god had there in the in the garden of
[51:30] eden
[51:30] it had failed but but oh as we heard
[51:32] this morning he wasn't willing leave it
[51:34] lay there
[51:35] but the prophet says he kept brooding
[51:37] over the earth
[51:38] and he says oh he kept brooding and he
[51:40] raised up a noah
[51:42] and he raised up an enoch and he and he
[51:45] raised up a dave and he raised up these
[51:47] ones through the scripture
[51:48] all that had a part but what was he
[51:50] doing he was brooding over the earth
[51:52] coming back until he got back to
[51:55] perfection again
[51:56] until he got back to the word made flesh
[51:59] a man in his image which was jesus
[52:02] christ it was the logos and we know that
[52:05] john 1 14 it says and the word was made
[52:08] flesh
[52:08] and dwelt among us oh it was a fleshly
[52:12] veil the
[52:13] the logos of the fullness of the godhead
[52:16] bodily was dwelling
[52:18] in the man jesus christ
[52:22] the prophet says the very substance of
[52:24] god
[52:25] oh the logos was made flesh and dwelt
[52:27] among us
[52:28] you think about how elohim once no man
[52:31] can
[52:32] see there
[52:35] are the children of israel they were led
[52:36] by a pillar of fire
[52:38] they they saw a cloud by day moses saw
[52:42] the back part of a man
[52:43] passed by him but no one had ever seen
[52:46] him
[52:46] but here comes jesus christ
[52:49] declaring him that no man has ever seen
[52:54] god made flesh dwelling amongst us he
[52:57] says that
[52:58] he but now became emmanuel god with us
[53:02] declaring himself brother branham
[53:06] uh as he references the scripture he
[53:08] goes declare in the greek
[53:10] root exegesis means to thoroughly
[53:13] explain
[53:14] and make clear he says that is what the
[53:16] living word
[53:18] jesus did he brought god to us
[53:23] for he was god
[53:26] he brought god to us for he was god
[53:29] oh think of it he took the written word
[53:33] he took all of the prophecies he took
[53:35] the laws
[53:36] everything that had been pinned down and
[53:39] the old testament
[53:40] here come the word made flesh and what
[53:42] did he do he made the bible a reality
[53:46] he made it real he took the written word
[53:49] and he was the living word being making
[53:53] that written word a reality before him
[53:57] oh my how beautiful it is i i was just
[54:00] thinking of
[54:01] of a blueprint of a house you can have
[54:04] everything on paper
[54:06] but it's not a reality until the
[54:09] blueprints
[54:10] have been built and the house has been
[54:12] constructed
[54:13] and it's all been finished out and you
[54:14] can actually walk into it
[54:16] you know some people are a little bit
[54:18] more visionary they they can look at the
[54:19] blueprints and i
[54:20] and i would say as my dad being a
[54:22] builder you could give him a set of
[54:24] blueprints
[54:25] and he could look through it and through
[54:26] that experience and through that
[54:28] knowledge of being a builder
[54:29] he can have a concept or an idea and he
[54:31] could just look at it and say
[54:33] yeah i see it i see what it is that's
[54:36] laying there i can see i know i i
[54:38] got an idea of how big and you know and
[54:39] then an expert can look at and say well
[54:41] you might want to do this and you might
[54:42] want to do that
[54:43] oh i just love how jesus took the
[54:46] written word
[54:46] and he made it a reality and oh how we
[54:49] got to get the words off of the bible
[54:51] and it got to become
[54:52] a living reality to us oh that's why
[54:55] jesus stood there or he was he was led
[54:59] after the spirit come upon him and he
[55:01] was led up there in the wilderness
[55:04] and there satan comes to tempt him and i
[55:07] love how the scripture says that he
[55:08] fasted for 40 days i believe and
[55:10] after he had fasted 40 days he was a
[55:13] hungered
[55:15] and then the devil tempted him you know
[55:18] i wouldn't have done the devil any good
[55:19] to tempt him while he was under that god
[55:20] called fast
[55:24] but he fasted for 40 days and not to get
[55:26] off on a little side thing but i thought
[55:27] you know
[55:28] my our lord fasted for 40 days how many
[55:31] of us have even fasted one day or two
[55:32] day
[55:35] maybe we ought to pray lord obey we
[55:36] ought to be open the lord if you want me
[55:38] to have a fast put it on my heart we got
[55:40] some needs we got some burdens in the
[55:41] church
[55:42] maybe i can get out of the way and allow
[55:44] you to speak and deal with my heart and
[55:46] i can get to a place
[55:47] where i can be part of the plan of god
[55:49] but there after he had fasted
[55:51] all the great tempter was there and he
[55:53] was tempting him
[55:55] and and he said why don't you just turn
[55:57] this this stone in the bread
[55:59] and what did the word say it is written
[56:03] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[56:05] every word that proceedeth out of the
[56:07] mouth of god
[56:08] while he was making that written word a
[56:10] reality
[56:13] oh and then he took him uh uh am i what
[56:15] what a
[56:16] you just your mind tries to grasp what
[56:19] dimensions and
[56:20] and where were they going and what was
[56:22] he seeing and he hadn't eaten for 40
[56:24] days and here's the tempter
[56:26] and and satan is showing jesus his eaten
[56:30] he's taking him and showing i don't
[56:31] doubt he saw satan's eating he saw this
[56:34] all these nations and all this grand
[56:36] things and all of his economy
[56:37] and he said all you got to do is just
[56:40] bow down and worship me
[56:41] and you can have all this technology you
[56:44] can have a little box where you say
[56:45] uh google and you have all the knowledge
[56:50] of the tree knowledge of good and evil
[56:52] right at the tip of your fingers
[56:54] but he said all of this is yours if
[56:56] you'll just bow down and worship me
[56:59] and oh jesus said it is written thou
[57:02] shalt
[57:02] worship the lord thy god and him only
[57:04] thou thou shall thou serve
[57:08] and so then he takes them up on a high a
[57:10] mountain or some pinnacle
[57:12] and he says all right well i couldn't
[57:14] get you with the food i can't get you
[57:16] with the worshiper well
[57:17] why don't you go ahead and prove
[57:18] something to me why don't you go and
[57:20] prove to me
[57:21] that you're the bride of christ why
[57:23] don't you go go ahead and do
[57:25] something that's not written in the word
[57:27] why don't you try to
[57:28] uh fulfill something that is not in the
[57:31] will of god to be fulfilled
[57:34] oh he does the same thing to do i don't
[57:36] know about you but i've tried to make a
[57:37] little chandelier thing move on the wall
[57:41] look there's something in me that wants
[57:44] to man there's something in me wants
[57:45] faith
[57:46] when the prophet of god told that little
[57:47] girl that was sick and dying in the bed
[57:49] and she said i got faith he goes no you
[57:51] don't
[57:52] he said all right we'll make that little
[57:53] thing hanging down from the chandelier
[57:55] move
[57:56] well i don't know about you but that
[57:58] strikes a little
[57:59] fear a little conviction a little
[58:01] uncertainty in your heart and you're
[58:02] like
[58:04] i can make it move move i got faith and
[58:06] it won't move
[58:08] oh the message has a way of stripping
[58:10] you bare
[58:11] if you think you're somebody you better
[58:13] watch out you need to look into the
[58:15] mirror of god's word we're nothing
[58:16] without him
[58:21] oh and and and then he goes he says to
[58:24] him well
[58:25] go ahead and cast myself down
[58:29] and then he uses the word to him does it
[58:32] the word said
[58:33] look the prophet spoke squirrels in
[58:34] existence you can speak quarrels and
[58:36] just go ahead and do it
[58:38] it better be a divine inspiration moving
[58:41] of the holy ghost or you're just going
[58:42] to be a disappointed
[58:44] discouraged believer have been there
[58:49] oh because something in us wants to
[58:50] manifest the word
[58:52] but i say he who is faithful and little
[58:54] is faithful much
[58:56] and a prophet stood there over and over
[58:57] and over said how can i teach them
[58:59] algebra
[59:00] if they won't learn their abcs i think
[59:02] the message
[59:03] believers need a checkup of their abcs
[59:09] how are you gonna expect to learn
[59:10] algebra when we we haven't even learned
[59:12] our abcs
[59:14] we haven't even got the dressing right
[59:16] we ain't even got the the witnessing
[59:18] right
[59:18] we ain't even gotten visiting the widows
[59:20] and the afflicted and testifying things
[59:22] right
[59:24] hey it's all right but if there's a
[59:27] genuine hunger
[59:29] as our pastor was talking about to
[59:31] fulfill these things oh in that right
[59:33] season in that right time
[59:34] you just look for the opportunity and
[59:36] god is going to bring these things to
[59:38] pass in your life
[59:40] he stood there
[59:43] and he stood there before the sadducees
[59:45] and pharisees
[59:51] and he said i and my father are one
[59:56] and they took up stones to kill him
[59:59] to stone him and he said why why are you
[1:00:03] picking up stones to stone me
[1:00:06] for which good work do you stone me for
[1:00:09] they say we're not going to stone you
[1:00:10] for all the good works that you do
[1:00:13] but we're gonna stone you because you
[1:00:14] blasphemy and you make yourself god
[1:00:17] and he said now is it not written in
[1:00:19] your scriptures ye are god's that to
[1:00:22] whom the word of the lord comes to
[1:00:24] and the scripture can't be broken what
[1:00:26] was it it was the word
[1:00:28] a living reality standing before them
[1:00:31] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:33] and forever
[1:00:35] oh my i feel up there he's standing
[1:00:37] there
[1:00:38] think of all the things that jesus had
[1:00:40] done before their eyes
[1:00:43] and philip says show us the father
[1:00:47] and it sufficeth us
[1:00:50] and jesus looks at him and says have i
[1:00:52] been with you so long
[1:00:56] have i been with you so long he
[1:00:59] who has seen me
[1:01:03] has seen the father why because it was
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] word that logos that was in tabernacle
[1:01:10] in a fleshly veil
[1:01:12] and it was none other than elohim made
[1:01:14] flesh
[1:01:17] oh i love how jesus said think not
[1:01:20] that i am come to destroy the law of the
[1:01:22] prophets
[1:01:23] i have not come to destroy but to
[1:01:26] fulfill
[1:01:27] what a statement what a statement i have
[1:01:29] not come to do away with the law
[1:01:31] when i have come to fulfill the law
[1:01:33] there was no man that could fulfill all
[1:01:34] the law
[1:01:36] outside of that the law had called for a
[1:01:38] kinsmen redeemer
[1:01:41] there was no man that could lay his life
[1:01:43] down and take it back up again
[1:01:45] other than the one it was spoken of
[1:01:49] that's why he could stand there and he
[1:01:51] could tell them
[1:01:52] tear down this temple and in three days
[1:01:56] i'll raise it up again why because the
[1:01:58] word said
[1:01:59] i will not suffer my holy one deceit
[1:02:02] corruption
[1:02:02] i will not leave his soul in hell that's
[1:02:06] why he can say the very things that he
[1:02:08] said
[1:02:10] he was the true mercy seat
[1:02:15] man had fallen and needed a kinsmen
[1:02:17] redeemer and hear the word god himself
[1:02:19] had come to fulfill his own law
[1:02:21] oh such wonderful love
[1:02:25] the high priest would go back behind the
[1:02:27] veil
[1:02:28] oh he'd sprinkle the mercy seat
[1:02:31] seven times
[1:02:35] but they could never fulfill all the law
[1:02:37] that's why paul said in hebrews 10 4 he
[1:02:39] said for it is not possible
[1:02:42] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[1:02:45] take away sins
[1:02:47] when he cometh into the world he says
[1:02:49] sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest
[1:02:51] not
[1:02:51] but a body thou hast prepared me
[1:02:55] and burn off burnt offerings and
[1:02:57] sacrifices for sin
[1:02:58] thou hast no pleasure then said lo
[1:03:02] i come in the volume of the book it is
[1:03:04] written of me to do
[1:03:06] thy will o god oh hallelujah what was he
[1:03:10] doing he was declaring
[1:03:13] he was bringing to pass he was
[1:03:15] fulfilling
[1:03:16] everything that was spoken of him
[1:03:19] the logos the word made flesh and i want
[1:03:22] to tell you you
[1:03:23] are a part of that logos
[1:03:26] when when did you become a part of that
[1:03:29] logos
[1:03:30] oh we know the word says according as he
[1:03:32] has chosen
[1:03:34] you in him before the foundation of the
[1:03:37] world that you should be holy
[1:03:39] you're going to be holy you're going to
[1:03:41] be without blame before him in love why
[1:03:44] because you were with him
[1:03:46] all the way back there before he even
[1:03:48] said
[1:03:49] let there be light you were identified
[1:03:51] with them right there
[1:03:53] oh the prophet said when moses parted
[1:03:56] the red sea
[1:03:57] you were there you had to be because
[1:04:00] you're identified with them
[1:04:01] he said when jesus christ rose on that
[1:04:04] easter morning
[1:04:05] you were there because you're identified
[1:04:07] with him and he said that when he
[1:04:09] poured out his holy spirit there on
[1:04:11] pentecost you are there because you're
[1:04:13] identified with them
[1:04:16] oh the word being expressed
[1:04:21] out of christ the mystery of god
[1:04:24] revealed
[1:04:26] prophet says listen closely now again as
[1:04:28] we go on
[1:04:29] going back to the original eden
[1:04:32] oh hallelujah in this service he's
[1:04:35] preaching the threefold mystery purpose
[1:04:38] of christ which was first
[1:04:41] to express himself in jesus christ
[1:04:44] the logos becoming flesh second
[1:04:49] was to have the preeminence in his
[1:04:51] church
[1:04:52] to have the preeminence in his bride i
[1:04:54] say oh god
[1:04:56] i believe that's where uh we are is him
[1:05:00] many of us allowing him to have the
[1:05:03] preeminence
[1:05:05] in us and thirdly to take us back to
[1:05:08] eden
[1:05:10] going back to the original eden then
[1:05:14] we are born of him we are filled with
[1:05:16] him see
[1:05:17] your life his life is in you
[1:05:21] then all our actions should declare him
[1:05:24] it's like taking life
[1:05:28] out of one tree don't fail this now this
[1:05:32] simple illustration that god is wanting
[1:05:36] you to catch
[1:05:38] it's like taking life out of one tree
[1:05:43] and putting it into another
[1:05:46] taking life out of a pear tree and put
[1:05:49] it in an apple tree
[1:05:51] it'll bear pears it's got to
[1:05:55] because the sap the life in it the germ
[1:05:58] is pear all right
[1:06:00] then all of our actions
[1:06:03] should declare him
[1:06:07] why why because it's
[1:06:11] his life living in you
[1:06:14] old things have passed away all
[1:06:18] things have become new it's not i
[1:06:21] that liveth but christ that liveth
[1:06:25] in me so then that means there was an
[1:06:28] old life in you that now has died
[1:06:32] and another life has come in
[1:06:35] and taken residency i'm reminded of how
[1:06:37] the our lord
[1:06:39] warned us look you can sweep the house
[1:06:42] clean
[1:06:44] but those spirits will go out there and
[1:06:46] wonder
[1:06:47] and they'll come back seven worse we got
[1:06:51] you can do a diet out but we got to get
[1:06:54] filled with
[1:06:55] his spirit it's like taking life out of
[1:06:59] one tree out of the bridegroom tree
[1:07:03] and putting it in the bride tree
[1:07:06] and then what will it do it will bear
[1:07:08] the same results
[1:07:10] it'll bear the same life it'll bear the
[1:07:13] same fruits
[1:07:14] the same works that i do you'll do also
[1:07:17] because it's me
[1:07:19] living in you i love how brother branham
[1:07:21] takes the scripture
[1:07:23] of joel 2 28 where when peter come out
[1:07:26] of there out of the upper room and said
[1:07:27] men and brethren we are not drunk as you
[1:07:29] suppose
[1:07:29] but this is that which the prophet joel
[1:07:31] had prophesied
[1:07:33] that i will pour out my spirit upon all
[1:07:35] flesh the prophet picks that up he says
[1:07:37] that word poor now when you look into it
[1:07:39] in the english it's almost
[1:07:41] something like vomited up or something
[1:07:43] else went out of him because he goes no
[1:07:45] it's the word canosis he poured
[1:07:48] himself out in other words he changed
[1:07:52] his form
[1:07:53] or he changed his mask
[1:07:57] from one thing to the other like taking
[1:07:59] the life out of one tree
[1:08:01] and put it in another he's not over here
[1:08:04] anymore
[1:08:05] he's moved over to here this is where he
[1:08:08] is
[1:08:09] he's now veiling himself in a different
[1:08:12] form
[1:08:12] in a different mass the prophet of god
[1:08:15] says oh there on pentecost
[1:08:17] he came and he veiled the logos word
[1:08:21] was veiled there in jesus christ
[1:08:26] but he died he completed that part of
[1:08:29] kinsman redeemer
[1:08:30] and he rose from the grave and he
[1:08:33] breathed
[1:08:35] upon his disciples and said receive
[1:08:38] ye the holy ghost go there in tarry
[1:08:42] and wait for the comforter to come and
[1:08:45] the prophet said
[1:08:46] on the day of pentecost he could gnosis
[1:08:50] he changed from the son of man to the
[1:08:53] son of god
[1:08:54] he had now changed his veil and now he
[1:08:57] was living
[1:08:58] in a people that were doing the same
[1:09:00] signs performing the same wonders
[1:09:03] because it was the same god now living
[1:09:06] in his bride
[1:09:09] that's why when the logos came there and
[1:09:12] struck down saul
[1:09:14] on the way to damascus
[1:09:18] oh he recognized what that was
[1:09:22] but what did he say what did the lord
[1:09:23] say to him so
[1:09:26] why do you persecute me
[1:09:30] i imagine saul's like lord
[1:09:34] who are you that i could persecute you
[1:09:39] it wasn't that he was persecuting a a
[1:09:42] flaming fire
[1:09:44] you couldn't persecute that fire that
[1:09:46] was burning on the mountain
[1:09:48] up there uh i'm talking about physically
[1:09:50] now
[1:09:54] but he says saul why persecuted me he
[1:09:57] said
[1:09:57] he said i am jesus
[1:10:02] where where was jesus christ
[1:10:06] he was living in his purchased
[1:10:09] possession
[1:10:11] living out the word he was building back
[1:10:13] up to something
[1:10:14] there was something in his mind a
[1:10:16] blueprint something that he was wanting
[1:10:18] to accomplish
[1:10:19] something that he wanted to achieve and
[1:10:21] he had changed his form he had changed
[1:10:23] his mass
[1:10:24] and now he was in his people god with
[1:10:26] skin on him
[1:10:27] oh that's what the badger skin always
[1:10:29] represented it was just a type
[1:10:31] the pillar of fire came down and
[1:10:33] tabernacled itself behind badger skin
[1:10:36] oh you think of a badger why badger skin
[1:10:40] oh
[1:10:40] all of us my the prophet talks about you
[1:10:43] watch out what's behind the skin yeah
[1:10:45] they might used to be that way
[1:10:47] might have been a sinner might have been
[1:10:49] a drunkard might have been this or that
[1:10:51] but what's behind the skin oh praise god
[1:10:54] he made a way
[1:10:55] that we could be forgiven and we can
[1:10:57] receive the holy ghost
[1:10:58] that now it's his life that's behind the
[1:11:00] skin
[1:11:02] god pouring himself out christ in you
[1:11:06] the prophet said god pouring himself
[1:11:08] into the human being
[1:11:10] and to the believer pour out it was part
[1:11:13] of his drama to do so
[1:11:17] oh we wanted to have the preeminence
[1:11:20] where all of our actions are declaring
[1:11:23] him
[1:11:24] we know all the all the acts of
[1:11:27] all the patriarchs and david and job all
[1:11:30] of them were just acting out their part
[1:11:32] of the drama
[1:11:32] as brother billy so beautifully preached
[1:11:34] on they were all declaring him the
[1:11:36] prophet said that all the acts
[1:11:38] of all the believers have just been in
[1:11:40] type expressing what god's great goal
[1:11:42] was and now
[1:11:43] in the last days he has revealed and
[1:11:46] shows it
[1:11:49] now in the last days he reveals and
[1:11:51] shows it
[1:11:52] all the acts everything down through all
[1:11:54] the bible
[1:11:55] we're just in types and things that god
[1:11:58] was wanting to reveal and show in this
[1:11:59] day
[1:12:00] i was thinking about rebecca you know no
[1:12:03] no doubt she's
[1:12:05] uh uh being a a good daughter there at
[1:12:08] the home and she's serving her mom and
[1:12:10] her dad
[1:12:12] and here comes some old man to town
[1:12:17] and she's out there at the well
[1:12:20] and he starts to tell her this story
[1:12:23] about some guy from
[1:12:25] some wealthy man from a a land far away
[1:12:31] that has a son and uh
[1:12:35] the lord showed me that you're gonna be
[1:12:37] his bride
[1:12:42] imagine imagine this pitch
[1:12:45] well let's go tell my parents hey mom
[1:12:47] this guy
[1:12:48] i met this old man out of the well and
[1:12:51] he's
[1:12:52] he's actually a servant of a wealthy man
[1:12:53] in a land far away
[1:12:55] and he wants me to marry his his son
[1:13:00] uh i'm calling the police
[1:13:05] uh honey you need to come in we're going
[1:13:06] to call the police and the authorities
[1:13:08] uh whoever this child abductor is
[1:13:11] but no no think uh think of this type
[1:13:16] that's in the bible this this type isn't
[1:13:19] it's a type for us to be able to look
[1:13:21] back into the word
[1:13:22] and see that type of that eliezer call
[1:13:25] here comes ellie easer
[1:13:27] he's making a call for a bride
[1:13:30] and something in rebecca's heart was
[1:13:33] crazy enough to believe it
[1:13:36] something in her was put there and so
[1:13:39] when they come back and tell her parents
[1:13:42] her parents say well the child is old
[1:13:44] enough to answer for herself
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:50] and she said i'll go but i want to tell
[1:13:53] you
[1:13:53] there there came a time where confession
[1:13:58] met action a lot of people confess they
[1:14:01] believe the message
[1:14:02] a lot of people confess that they're
[1:14:04] following the message a lot of people
[1:14:06] say
[1:14:07] they believe what the eliza call has
[1:14:09] said
[1:14:10] but are they going to where eliezer has
[1:14:13] taken them
[1:14:15] oh my when you've left your family
[1:14:18] and by god's grace i never i never had
[1:14:21] to do some of those hard things that i
[1:14:23] know
[1:14:23] some of you have jesus said i come not
[1:14:28] uh he said i come with a sword i'll
[1:14:30] separate my mother from daughter and
[1:14:32] father from son
[1:14:33] and and
[1:14:38] oh it happens and
[1:14:42] rebecca had to come to a place
[1:14:45] where her confession of saying i will go
[1:14:51] where she actually left and
[1:14:54] said goodbye to everything that she
[1:14:57] ever had known and i pray oh god
[1:15:01] may the elies or call of this message
[1:15:04] take me away from everything that ever
[1:15:07] thought in my mind
[1:15:08] every idea and every uh false
[1:15:12] thing that i've ever conceived in my
[1:15:14] mind oh i just
[1:15:15] want to know more about him
[1:15:18] and that's why the prophet was sent
[1:15:22] do you imagine the conversations on that
[1:15:24] journey
[1:15:27] you're on it
[1:15:30] oh ellie's been talking to you the whole
[1:15:32] time
[1:15:34] there's an old song eliezer tell me more
[1:15:38] oh there's nothing like it but you know
[1:15:41] a lot of people start out
[1:15:44] think about a lot of people start out on
[1:15:45] the journey
[1:15:48] they get going a little bit you know
[1:15:50] just like lot's wife
[1:15:52] started out got there but there was
[1:15:55] something back there
[1:15:59] she just turned i'm reminded
[1:16:03] of how our pastor pointed out this
[1:16:04] morning just a wink
[1:16:07] she's walking and just a turn
[1:16:10] don't do it church quit winking at the
[1:16:14] world
[1:16:14] quit looking back we we we could go on a
[1:16:18] sidetrack in all the ways that you can
[1:16:20] do that
[1:16:21] but i pray that the holy ghost would
[1:16:23] convict your heart right now
[1:16:25] and right now be brought to you remember
[1:16:27] to all the ways that you're winking at
[1:16:30] the world
[1:16:31] don't do it keep your eyes stayed on
[1:16:34] christ
[1:16:35] keep your eyes on the message keep
[1:16:38] following right in line
[1:16:39] i don't care if the burning world of
[1:16:42] satan's eating back here
[1:16:43] is calling for you there's something
[1:16:45] else that's calling your name
[1:16:47] and that's leading you back to eden
[1:16:49] don't turn around don't do it
[1:16:53] a lot of people start out
[1:16:56] some of you all have been believing this
[1:16:58] message for a while
[1:17:00] some of y'all saw 1977 come and go
[1:17:07] a lot of people fell away
[1:17:11] a lot of people here recently
[1:17:16] over the course of several years i would
[1:17:17] say
[1:17:19] fell away you think that's something new
[1:17:24] one day jesus was going along and the
[1:17:25] prophet of god said
[1:17:27] jesus had to shake some parasites off of
[1:17:30] them
[1:17:32] jesus just had to shake some parasites
[1:17:34] off of them
[1:17:36] he said the prophet said he had too many
[1:17:38] people
[1:17:39] following him well that's not christian
[1:17:44] how dare him say something and you think
[1:17:46] you're a christian
[1:17:47] saying we all come how we are just god
[1:17:50] doesn't look
[1:17:51] look on the outside he looks on the
[1:17:53] inside no jesus
[1:17:55] had to shake some parasites off of them
[1:17:57] one time because too many people were
[1:17:58] following him
[1:18:00] so what did he say that the prophet
[1:18:02] points out he had his disciples which
[1:18:04] were the twelve
[1:18:06] knowing one of them was the devil he had
[1:18:10] the seventy
[1:18:11] which the prophet says was the
[1:18:12] ministerial association
[1:18:14] and he had the congregation by the
[1:18:17] thousands
[1:18:19] and one day probably was the day that
[1:18:22] you invited your mother-in-law or your
[1:18:24] family or your in-laws to
[1:18:26] church and the pastor decides to play
[1:18:29] this day this scripture
[1:18:31] is fulfilled
[1:18:36] and he says unless you eat my
[1:18:40] flesh and drink my blood you'll have no
[1:18:43] part of me
[1:18:46] oh the congregation by the thousand
[1:18:49] gone i don't know maybe that was 1977
[1:18:53] who knows i'm not trying to make
[1:18:54] anything up here but a lot of people
[1:18:56] left
[1:18:59] i'm really not trying to make anything
[1:19:00] up so don't don't follow that but
[1:19:03] in type that's what the word does people
[1:19:05] can follow so far
[1:19:07] but they can only go along with it so
[1:19:09] far and he says unless
[1:19:11] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:19:13] have no part of me
[1:19:14] oh i love how the prophet dramatizes
[1:19:16] that says oh man some doctor out there
[1:19:18] i'm like what
[1:19:18] i mean can you imagine this what is he a
[1:19:21] vampire this ain't any kind of way to
[1:19:22] live
[1:19:25] so there goes the thousands so he was
[1:19:28] left with the 12 in the ministerial
[1:19:30] association of the 70.
[1:19:33] and somehow you know that 70 they
[1:19:35] thought they were just going to plug on
[1:19:36] through
[1:19:38] you know some people come for the fishes
[1:19:39] and the loaves
[1:19:41] some are enamored by that first pool in
[1:19:43] that second pool
[1:19:44] oh my but when it comes to that third
[1:19:46] pool that opening word when it comes to
[1:19:48] the revealed word of the hour
[1:19:49] oh there's something that just starts
[1:19:51] shaking things
[1:19:54] and he goes all right and what does the
[1:19:57] prophet say i love this
[1:19:58] he says he never explained it
[1:20:02] he never explained it he just said it
[1:20:06] never explained it says the disciples
[1:20:08] could you imagine them thinking that
[1:20:11] how are we supposed to eat his flesh and
[1:20:13] drink his blood
[1:20:16] but they were predestinated
[1:20:19] think of it he just told them to eat his
[1:20:22] flesh and drink his blood
[1:20:27] he didn't explain it so he kept going
[1:20:29] and he goes well
[1:20:30] what happens when you see the son of man
[1:20:32] ascending into the clouds from once he
[1:20:33] came
[1:20:35] not about that time the ministerial
[1:20:36] association
[1:20:38] they said all right that's about all we
[1:20:40] can handle and they go
[1:20:43] and what was left it was just the 12
[1:20:45] there that was left
[1:20:47] and he turned to him and said will you
[1:20:48] go also
[1:20:51] will you go also he didn't even explain
[1:20:54] anything to him will you go also and i
[1:20:58] love
[1:20:59] how uh peter says those words
[1:21:02] where are we gonna go where are we gonna
[1:21:04] go
[1:21:05] thou alone has those words of eternal
[1:21:08] life you realize that shaking is still
[1:21:10] going on today
[1:21:12] oh it's still shaking look we got
[1:21:14] plagues coming that are shaking
[1:21:16] there's things in the world that are
[1:21:17] shaking and if it can be shaken it's
[1:21:20] going to be shook
[1:21:21] but there is a people no matter what is
[1:21:23] said
[1:21:24] no matter what the word says something
[1:21:26] that says
[1:21:27] i believe it i can't explain it and it
[1:21:30] doesn't have to be explained to me
[1:21:32] but something in me says amen to the
[1:21:35] word of god
[1:21:35] and you'll never been shaken away from
[1:21:37] this message because it's thus
[1:21:39] saith the lord which you're a part of
[1:21:44] you're a part of thus saith the lord you
[1:21:46] are the word you're a part of that logos
[1:21:53] you'll never turn back
[1:21:56] we don't need psychology we don't need
[1:21:58] explaining
[1:22:01] ah look i i hate to say it this way but
[1:22:04] but the more i
[1:22:07] the more i dig in and dig into the
[1:22:09] message and the more that's revealed to
[1:22:11] me the
[1:22:12] the less i realize i don't even know
[1:22:15] oh it's almost a paradox and and you go
[1:22:18] along so long and you hear it over and
[1:22:19] over and you've been serving the lord 20
[1:22:21] years and all of a sudden clicks and
[1:22:23] you're almost like
[1:22:24] well i'm almost embarrassed to even say
[1:22:25] that
[1:22:27] 20 years of believing this thing i've
[1:22:29] been even preaching it
[1:22:31] and there it is it's been right there in
[1:22:33] front of me all on but
[1:22:34] that's how great god is we're going
[1:22:36] higher and higher
[1:22:38] into higher heights into deeper depths
[1:22:41] oh
[1:22:41] we're going all the way there's no
[1:22:43] period on what we believe
[1:22:44] there's more for you if you can believe
[1:22:47] it you can have it
[1:22:51] oh he says
[1:23:10] he says and remember we are now his
[1:23:12] bride
[1:23:14] pregnant with his spirit oh my the
[1:23:16] church
[1:23:17] bearing children impregnated by his
[1:23:19] spirit with his name
[1:23:20] bearing his name bearing his life
[1:23:22] bringing forth the signs of his life
[1:23:24] evident with the preeminences evident of
[1:23:27] his resurrection
[1:23:28] showing that he's not dead but alive
[1:23:30] forevermore
[1:23:31] this is eternal life and it vindicates
[1:23:33] to the world that we're alive in him
[1:23:36] how do you know because you're a church
[1:23:39] member
[1:23:42] because christ is living through
[1:23:45] you now i want to say that's the other
[1:23:47] side of the prophecy
[1:23:49] we heard this morning how we can look at
[1:23:52] satan's eden and we've seen all the
[1:23:55] prophecies
[1:23:56] being fulfilled but there's more coming
[1:24:02] i got news for you it's going to get
[1:24:03] worse
[1:24:05] and if the lord tarries we're going to
[1:24:07] be sharing another quote
[1:24:10] showing look what else has been
[1:24:11] fulfilled because every single one of
[1:24:14] them will come to pass
[1:24:16] some of the differences whether we'll be
[1:24:17] here or not to see it
[1:24:19] ourselves satan's eden is going to get
[1:24:22] worse
[1:24:25] but don't let that discourage you that's
[1:24:28] the other side of the prophecy
[1:24:31] there's another side of the prophecy
[1:24:34] where the life that was in the
[1:24:35] bridegroom tree
[1:24:37] is now in the bride tree going to bring
[1:24:41] to pass
[1:24:41] every single word that the prophet spoke
[1:24:45] of the bride
[1:24:51] oh hallelujah christ in you his life
[1:24:55] bringing forth his evidences his signs
[1:24:58] my mom i look bringing his signs of life
[1:25:00] as an evidence
[1:25:02] of his resurrection proving to the world
[1:25:04] that eternal life
[1:25:06] vindicates to the world that we're alive
[1:25:08] in him and think of it
[1:25:09] alive with god our redeemer who created
[1:25:13] us for this very purpose
[1:25:15] the church and his creative life
[1:25:18] is in us his creative life
[1:25:21] is in you you know prophet said a man
[1:25:24] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:25:28] you know what omnipotent means all
[1:25:30] powerful
[1:25:32] we saw a man in this generation fully
[1:25:35] surrendered to god
[1:25:36] and he was omnipotent amen i have no
[1:25:40] qualms to say that because he said it
[1:25:43] and that was the word made flesh and
[1:25:45] it's thus saith the lord
[1:25:46] he said a man fully surrendered
[1:25:50] to god is omnipotent and then of course
[1:25:54] what does he do he takes you to the
[1:25:56] scripture
[1:25:57] and says if you say to this mountain and
[1:26:00] you don't doubt in your heart and you
[1:26:01] believe what you asked for
[1:26:02] you're going to have it it's going to
[1:26:04] happen amen
[1:26:06] he says oh when two omnipotents meet
[1:26:08] something has to shake
[1:26:11] oh hallelujah he's not asking us to do
[1:26:15] something he ain't already done or

[1:38:02] to the time of life you shall have a son
[1:38:06] and now abraham he's going on about his
[1:38:09] business
[1:38:10] believing the process in the process
[1:38:13] of this prophecy being fulfilled can you
[1:38:16] imagine

[1:42:43] let me show you things to come
[1:42:46] and there john oh let me preach for a
[1:42:49] little bit church
[1:42:50] there john was caught up there
[1:42:54] and he said oh immediately i was in the
[1:42:56] spirit
[1:42:58] and there was one that sat upon the
[1:43:00] throne with a little book in his hand
[1:43:03] and him to look upon he was like sardis
[1:43:04] said it was like jasper and there was a
[1:43:06] rainbow above us
[1:43:07] around his head and he said there coming
[1:43:11] a mighty angel
[1:43:14] saying who is worthy to open the book
[1:43:17] we're talking about redemption now i
[1:43:19] redeemed you your name was in that book
[1:43:23] who is worthy to open the book
[1:43:26] and loose the seven seals thereof
[1:43:30] and john he's looking he's looking in
[1:43:33] heaven
[1:43:33] he's looking down in earth he can't see
[1:43:36] nobody worthy
[1:43:40] no no no one there is worthy
[1:43:44] oh but he was the lamb slain before the
[1:43:46] foundation of the world
[1:43:49] and all of a sudden here comes one and
[1:43:51] the angel says weep not john
[1:43:54] for the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:43:56] prevailed to take the book
[1:43:58] and in the first seal the prophet says
[1:44:00] john turning
[1:44:02] he saw a lamb coming out it must have
[1:44:04] been bloody
[1:44:06] and cut and wounded it had been slain a
[1:44:09] lamb
[1:44:09] that had been slain and it was still
[1:44:11] bloody
[1:44:14] if you had cut the lamb and killed it
[1:44:16] the way that the lamb was anyhow
[1:44:19] it was hacked to pieces on a cross
[1:44:22] spears in his side and nails in his
[1:44:25] hands and feet
[1:44:26] and thorn over his brow he was in an
[1:44:29] awful condition
[1:44:31] and this lamb had come forth and went
[1:44:32] over to him that sat upon the throne
[1:44:35] that held the complete title deed of
[1:44:37] redemption and the lamb goes and takes
[1:44:39] the book
[1:44:40] out of the hand of him that sat upon the
[1:44:42] throne and was to look
[1:44:44] and took and open the seals and open the
[1:44:47] book
[1:44:48] then when that happened we found out
[1:44:50] there must have been something great
[1:44:52] something took place in heaven for the
[1:44:55] elders the 24 elders and the beasts and
[1:44:57] everything in heaven began to cry worthy
[1:44:59] and here come the angels and poured out
[1:45:01] the vials of the prayers of the saints
[1:45:02] the saints under the altar screamed out
[1:45:04] worthy art the lamb
[1:45:06] for you have redeemed us and now you
[1:45:09] have made us kings and priests
[1:45:10] and we shall rule on the earth oh my
[1:45:14] and that soul when he opened the book
[1:45:15] you see the book
[1:45:17] actually was planned and written before
[1:45:20] the foundation of the world
[1:45:21] i've been about 55 minutes here we'll
[1:45:24] close
[1:45:24] shortly
[1:45:28] he says the book actually was planned
[1:45:30] and written before the foundation of the
[1:45:32] world
[1:45:32] this book the bible was really written
[1:45:35] before the foundational word in christ
[1:45:37] being the lamb was slain before the
[1:45:39] foundation of the world
[1:45:40] and the members of his bride their names
[1:45:42] were put in the lamb's book of life
[1:45:44] before the foundation of the world but
[1:45:46] it's been sealed up
[1:45:49] and now it's being revealed whose names
[1:45:52] are there
[1:45:53] and all about it now we're familiar with
[1:45:56] these scriptures
[1:45:57] amos 3 7 now it's being revealed and
[1:46:00] whose names and what's all about it
[1:46:03] surely god does nothing
[1:46:07] but he revealeth his secrets unto his
[1:46:09] servants
[1:46:10] the prophets we know the word always
[1:46:13] comes to the prophet
[1:46:15] brother branham gives us the type just
[1:46:17] how john john was a manifestation there
[1:46:20] of isaiah 40 a voice of one crying in
[1:46:22] the wilderness saying
[1:46:24] the messiah is coming he was there to
[1:46:27] prepare the way
[1:46:28] and there he is speaking behold the lamb
[1:46:31] of god who takes away the sin of the
[1:46:32] world
[1:46:33] the prophet says that the word came to
[1:46:36] john
[1:46:36] while he was in the water because the
[1:46:39] word has to come to the prophet
[1:46:43] and brother brandon makes this peculiar
[1:46:45] statement if you will he says
[1:46:46] and when he did he said it now changed
[1:46:48] from the prophet
[1:46:50] to the prophecy let me say it in other
[1:46:52] words like this
[1:46:55] the voice of the sign is vindicated
[1:46:58] by the manifestation of what was spoken
[1:47:01] brother branham taught that he said a
[1:47:02] prophet is vindicated by the
[1:47:03] manifestation of the word by what he
[1:47:05] spoke coming to pass
[1:47:06] so here john says behold the lamb of god
[1:47:08] that takes away the sin of the world
[1:47:10] and here came the word to the prophet
[1:47:13] now we've heard that illustration think
[1:47:15] of a city sign
[1:47:16] you know you're coming back from
[1:47:18] louisiana and you see a sign that says
[1:47:19] you know it says a terrell dallas fort
[1:47:22] worth
[1:47:24] well it says dallas is in 80 miles
[1:47:27] well if you go 80 miles and dallas ain't
[1:47:29] there
[1:47:30] then the voice of the sign was wrong
[1:47:33] but when you when you look at the sign
[1:47:36] and it points you in a certain direction
[1:47:38] and when you get there you see the city
[1:47:41] then you know you have now come to the
[1:47:43] manifestation
[1:47:45] of what the voice of the sign was coming
[1:47:47] to and so if i could say it like this
[1:47:50] with john he was saying he's coming he's
[1:47:53] coming
[1:47:54] but then it changed to he is
[1:47:57] here it changed from he is coming oh
[1:48:01] hallelujah
[1:48:02] to his what was that third pull what was
[1:48:05] the opening of those seven seals
[1:48:07] come on church let me just say what the
[1:48:09] prophet said here out of the breach
[1:48:11] he says oh hallelujah now but this book
[1:48:15] a mysterious book it's a book of
[1:48:17] redemption
[1:48:19] now we know this book of redemption will
[1:48:20] not be thoroughly understood
[1:48:22] it's probed at through six church ages
[1:48:24] but at the end
[1:48:26] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:48:29] his mystery
[1:48:30] he winds up all of the loose ends that
[1:48:33] these other fellows probed at
[1:48:35] and the mysteries comes down from god
[1:48:38] as the word of god and reveals
[1:48:41] the entire revelation
[1:48:44] of
[1:48:48] remember your name was in that book
[1:48:50] that's being revealed
[1:48:52] the entire revelation of god which you
[1:48:54] were part of then the godhead
[1:48:56] and everything else is settled all of
[1:48:58] the mysteries serpent seed and whatever
[1:49:00] more it's to be revealed
[1:49:01] i'm not just making that up
[1:49:04] it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to
[1:49:07] you out of the book
[1:49:08] at the sounding of the seventh angel's
[1:49:10] message the mystery of god
[1:49:12] should be finished that's been declared
[1:49:14] by his holy prophets
[1:49:17] that's the prophets who wrote the word
[1:49:19] at the sounding of the seven
[1:49:21] church age the last church age all the
[1:49:23] loose ends and those things
[1:49:25] the church ages have been probed at
[1:49:28] we'll be wound up together we're moving
[1:49:29] right to a close quickly
[1:49:31] and when the seals are broke
[1:49:34] and the mysteries is revealed down
[1:49:37] comes the angel the messenger christ
[1:49:41] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[1:49:43] the sea
[1:49:44] with a rainbow over his head now
[1:49:46] remember
[1:49:48] this seventh angel is on earth at the
[1:49:50] time of this coming
[1:49:52] just as john was given his message that
[1:49:56] same time that the messiah come in those
[1:49:58] days john
[1:49:59] knew he would see him because he was
[1:50:01] going to introduce him
[1:50:03] and we realized that in the scriptures
[1:50:05] over in malachi 4
[1:50:07] there's to be one like john
[1:50:10] an elijah to whom the word of the god
[1:50:13] can come to
[1:50:14] and he is to reveal by the holy spirit
[1:50:16] all the mysteries of god
[1:50:18] and restore the faith of the children
[1:50:20] back to the faith of the apostolic
[1:50:22] fathers
[1:50:23] restore back all these mysteries that's
[1:50:25] been probed at through
[1:50:26] all these denominational years now
[1:50:28] that's what the word says
[1:50:30] i'm just responsible for what it says
[1:50:33] it's written that's right
[1:50:34] that's what it is now we'll end on this
[1:50:37] right here it says
[1:50:38] now we see that seven seal book
[1:50:42] now is the mystery of redemption it's a
[1:50:45] book
[1:50:46] of redemption from god now all the
[1:50:48] mysteries at this time should be
[1:50:50] finished at the sounding of this
[1:50:51] messenger
[1:50:52] now here's the angel on earth
[1:50:55] and another angel mighty messenger
[1:50:59] come down see this angel was an earthly
[1:51:03] angel
[1:51:04] messenger but here comes one down from
[1:51:07] heaven
[1:51:09] well we're the revelation of those seven
[1:51:11] seals the prophet said those seals
[1:51:13] were christ he said here comes one down
[1:51:16] from heaven a rainbow covenancy
[1:51:18] only christ it could be o fools and slow
[1:51:23] of heart
[1:51:23] to believe all that the prophets have
[1:51:25] spoken
[1:51:28] o fools and slaw of heart to believe all
[1:51:31] that was spoken the prophet said he
[1:51:34] never come right out
[1:51:35] to those uh uh disciples on the road to
[1:51:38] emmaus and said
[1:51:39] now i'm the messiah i'm the one that's
[1:51:42] resurrected from the dead
[1:51:44] the prophet said he just took him back
[1:51:46] to the scripture
[1:51:48] hallelujah he just took him back to the
[1:51:51] scripture
[1:51:52] and said as it was in the days of noah
[1:51:54] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:51:56] of man
[1:51:57] he said as it was written in malachi 4
[1:51:59] the musicians would come
[1:52:00] oh what did he do he just took us back
[1:52:03] to the scripture
[1:52:04] he didn't have to explain it he never
[1:52:07] came out
[1:52:07] right there and said it
[1:52:11] but something in the believer sees it
[1:52:15] he said i will restore saith the lord
[1:52:20] the same son that rose in the east
[1:52:26] the same son that rose
[1:52:30] and breathed on the disciples and said
[1:52:32] receive you the holy ghost
[1:52:34] and he was a morphe into a bride body
[1:52:38] that was declaring themselves
[1:52:40] the prophet said that jesus received a
[1:52:42] bride fresh at pentecost but it fell
[1:52:45] and the prophet says the same son that
[1:52:48] rose in the east he says oh now there's
[1:52:50] come a time of doom and gloom
[1:52:52] we've gone through the church ages but
[1:52:54] the same son
[1:52:58] that rose in the east has risen
[1:53:01] in the west at the evening time
[1:53:06] it shall be light and what was he doing
[1:53:08] god the fullness of the word has now
[1:53:10] been restored
[1:53:12] and god is in morphe he's changing his
[1:53:16] mask
[1:53:16] now and he's now living in the bride and
[1:53:19] she's declaring that he's the same
[1:53:21] yesterday today and forever if you could
[1:53:23] play something lightly as we all stand
[1:53:31] the prophet said the same s-o-n that
[1:53:33] poured himself out
[1:53:34] kinos kenosis on the day of pentecost
[1:53:38] promised to do the same thing in the
[1:53:40] evening time

[1:53:46] this is our jubilee throw down your home
[1:53:50] you're free church turn them loose satan

[1:54:16] under divine promise

[1:54:21] that word is going
[1:54:22] to be fulfilled in you god changing his
[1:54:24] mask
[1:54:25] you're the other side of the prophecy
[1:54:29] amen let's just sing this jesus be
[1:54:34] the
[1:54:45] jesus christ

[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:16] me
[1:55:22] jesus i surrender all
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:55] you feel that you have a need or
[1:55:57] something in your heart you just want to
[1:55:58] lift up to the lord
[1:56:01] you know there's more of god for you to
[1:56:03] have and you feel prayer with hell
[1:56:06] we just want to approach the lord
[1:56:10] lord jesus we just approach you now as
[1:56:16] we've tried to deliver a little burden
[1:56:18] that you placed upon our heart
[1:56:20] lord when we look into the vastness of
[1:56:22] your word and how rich it is
[1:56:25] lord we stand in all many times we
[1:56:29] feel like the prophet there standing in
[1:56:32] your glory
[1:56:33] feeling so unworthy
[1:56:37] but you took the coal of fire and you
[1:56:40] touched his lips and he said here i am
[1:56:42] lord send me
[1:56:44] lord many times we feel so unworthy we
[1:56:46] look at ourselves and
[1:56:49] we maybe look at the past lord but we
[1:56:50] thank you
[1:56:52] lord that you're the kinsman redeemer
[1:56:53] that came and paid the price for sin
[1:56:56] lord and you just didn't leave it there
[1:56:58] two thousand years ago but you were
[1:57:00] building to achieve something you had a
[1:57:02] great plan in mind
[1:57:04] a great climatic a nail-biting moment as
[1:57:07] our brother
[1:57:07] spoke about here in the end time in
[1:57:09] satan's eden that you would achieve a
[1:57:11] bride
[1:57:13] that would manifest this spoken word
[1:57:15] that you've given
[1:57:16] lord we feel that we fall short so many
[1:57:19] times
[1:57:20] sometimes we maybe feel like abraham we
[1:57:22] ran off to maybe a country and made a
[1:57:23] decision we should have made lord
[1:57:26] we're just looking to you that you just
[1:57:28] help us to get right back into the
[1:57:29] channel lord
[1:57:30] help us to turn away from the things of
[1:57:32] the world and have
[1:57:33] have one eye a single eye just for you
[1:57:36] lord as our pastor talked about may we
[1:57:38] not wink at the things of the world
[1:57:40] may we not get caught up on the other
[1:57:41] side of the uh a prophecy or get stuck
[1:57:44] in the middle where we're
[1:57:45] we're looking to and fro lord we want to
[1:57:47] surrender all to you lord
[1:57:50] we want to do our part or we want to
[1:57:52] play our part in the drama
[1:57:54] we want you to live out your life
[1:57:58] through us as you have so beautifully
[1:57:59] spoken
[1:58:00] we just love you now we commit the
[1:58:02] people to you
[1:58:04] lord and just pray that you make up the
[1:58:05] difference lord where we fall short
[1:58:07] that your people would be edified and be
[1:58:09] drawn closer to you we pray we commit
[1:58:11] all the needs to you
[1:58:13] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:58:24] i have a father
[1:58:46] there's
[1:58:50] he knows my name
[1:58:57] he knows
[1:59:03] he says
[1:59:16] i am
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:42] we know
[1:59:48] he knows why
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:06] you know what makes a promise
[2:00:11] so real is when you can make it your own
[2:00:16] you know it it isn't that
[2:00:19] god's a healer it's when you can say god
[2:00:23] is my healer it isn't that he's a
[2:00:27] deliverer that god has delivered
[2:00:30] this one and god has delivered that one
[2:00:34] it's when you can say god hath delivered
[2:00:36] me
[2:00:37] and that's what we're talking about
[2:00:41] we're talking about a time that it's not
[2:00:44] the history that speaks about the
[2:00:48] fulfillment
[2:00:49] it's not those that god has
[2:00:52] delivered it's when we can say god has
[2:00:56] made it real
[2:00:57] to me and it's when we can bring it to
[2:01:00] others
[2:01:01] and say this promise is here for you
[2:01:05] and you can eat and you can partake
[2:01:09] and you can manifest and that's what
[2:01:13] makes this
[2:01:14] real that in this last hour
[2:01:17] there were going to be a people that
[2:01:19] didn't know it
[2:01:20] by history they knew it by experience
[2:01:25] and they could show it by experience and
[2:01:28] they could talk about
[2:01:29] a god that doesn't have a history
[2:01:33] of the things they've done but that
[2:01:36] i'm a witness that he's done these
[2:01:39] things
[2:01:40] and that's why this bride is going to
[2:01:43] rise up
[2:01:45] she's going to be a people of experience
[2:01:49] of people of manifestation
[2:01:52] and all the promises that were spoken
[2:01:57] there's somebody that can say i know
[2:02:00] this has happened i know he's a
[2:02:04] deliverer
[2:02:05] i know he's a healer because i
[2:02:09] am the manifestation
[2:02:13] and the proof of it and that's what our
[2:02:16] hearts desire
[2:02:17] is is that it's not the
[2:02:21] mental side of it it's the manifestation
[2:02:26] side of it and if you have part of god's
[2:02:29] promise
[2:02:31] living in you then you will manifest it
[2:02:36] if you have a circumstance in your life
[2:02:38] a loved one that's not
[2:02:40] saved someone that's sick
[2:02:43] someone that needs deliverance this is
[2:02:46] the hour
[2:02:48] that we claim the manifestation
[2:02:52] and the deliverance and the word
[2:02:56] coming to pass in flesh
[2:02:59] and you hold that promise there in your
[2:03:03] life
[2:03:04] until it comes to pass amen i appreciate
[2:03:07] that word don't you
[2:03:09] a church that's going to see
[2:03:12] the promise fulfilled is that your
[2:03:16] heart's desire
[2:03:18] that's your portion church that's what's
[2:03:21] given to us
[2:03:24] that's what we have we don't want to be
[2:03:27] stuck
[2:03:28] we want to be the fulfillment
[2:03:31] of the prophecy fulfilled
[2:03:35] and manifested amen you hold that right
[2:03:38] before the lord
[2:03:40] and that's one more time let's approach
[2:03:43] his throne
[2:03:46] and you hold your desire before
[2:03:50] you hold that loved one before you hold
[2:03:54] that
[2:03:54] child before him you hold that need
[2:03:58] before him and you say lord we've heard
[2:04:05] now we want to believe and see
[2:04:08] and i believe that i'm going to see
[2:04:12] my heart's desire come to pass
[2:04:16] because the prophecy says that it will
[2:04:21] our gracious father
[2:04:24] we have many needs as a body of
[2:04:27] believers
[2:04:30] we have many needs as individuals
[2:04:34] as ones that are needy
[2:04:38] but we have a promise that says we will
[2:04:41] see
[2:04:42] these things manifested
[2:04:45] and come to pass and that's what i
[2:04:48] believe
[2:04:48] lord i believe in my own personal
[2:04:52] individual life i will see
[2:04:56] the word of god fulfilled
[2:05:00] and the promises fulfilled this
[2:05:03] is my day this is my
[2:05:06] hour this is my time of manifestation
[2:05:10] this is the day it becomes real to me
[2:05:14] and i see these things
[2:05:18] in the life that i'm living
[2:05:21] not other people's healing my healing
[2:05:24] not other people's deliverance my
[2:05:27] deliverance
[2:05:28] not other families promises and
[2:05:30] victories
[2:05:31] but my family's promises
[2:05:34] and victory lord i shall see
[2:05:38] this word live that the prophet spoke
[2:05:42] i'll see it in my world i'll see it in
[2:05:46] my
[2:05:46] generation i'll see it in my people
[2:05:49] that i know the fulfillment
[2:05:54] has come and i believe it lord
[2:05:57] and i'm looking for it let me be a
[2:06:00] lighthouse
[2:06:01] let me be a witness let me be a
[2:06:04] manifestation
[2:06:06] let me be the one that speaks it
[2:06:09] and sees it come to pass this is
[2:06:12] my day lord the day that you have spoken
[2:06:16] and we believe it with all our heart
[2:06:20] amen praise god
