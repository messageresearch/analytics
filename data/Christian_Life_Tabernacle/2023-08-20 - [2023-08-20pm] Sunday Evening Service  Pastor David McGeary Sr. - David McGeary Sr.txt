goodness can we all the words we have in our vocabulary can't describe his magnificence I like that song so much we sing that if words felt like rain from my lips it couldn't express it all so we say Lord listen to our heart amen let's turn our heart to him one more time this morning this evening our gracious father we heard such wonderful word this morning Lord that we could feast forever Lord there's no ability within us father that could match to that the Lord we just know that by grace and mercy you'll touch the heart and encourage your people we just come humbly before you Lord and trusting as you said in your scriptures you said come let us reason together and though your sins be like Scarlet I will make them white as snow Lord we just long for your working within our lives we ask you to bless us now as we read your word in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bible the only person that could come behind this morning's message and preach is brother Tom but I I told Brother Tom that I just let him do one service and and he said he was grateful so we'll do our best but certainly uh has said it's very difficult to come behind such a great Fellowship this morning let's turn to Hebrews and I I just want to um continue on a little bit from Wednesday night and and um keeping in mind all the things that were spoken to us this morning so Hebrews 11 we want to read um the starting in the 11th chapter and uh fifth verse and certainly Enoch uh is special to us because that's the kinmanship we want to have we want to be of the class of Enoch right he says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because he had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it was impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by Faith Also let's turn over to Ephesians the second chapter of Ephesians and read the 10th verse here which is a great verse read many many times if I messaged believers for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them heavenly father bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated we know it's a a great thing for Believers to recognize the day that they're living in and to be able to look out upon the things that are transpiring and to be able to place yourself in the plan of God I think the scripture here points that Noah uh had that ability that what was credited to Noah that he was warned of God the scripture just simply saying by faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet see not seen as yet moves with fear and prepared an ark for the saving of his house and of all the things that the message is there's one thing that we're sure that it is it is a warning of the oncoming judgment it it is simply spoken out and told us the things that are to come and I think it behooves us I believe to be moved upon with fear and and I don't mean the kind of fear that the world has but the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God the ultimate respect for What God Says and that what he says is going to come to pass uh you know many times people mistake a lot of things that they mistake a perception uh for reality but perception isn't necessarily reality and perception isn't necessarily the way that things are Noah he was preparing an art for things that have not yet been seen but he was warned of God by faith in other words by Revelation Noah knew that it was going to rain and that God was going to destroy the world by flood because God had revealed it to him and and he wasn't afraid of the reproach to accept the word of God and he was moved by fear he prepared an art now the ark wasn't for him only it was for his house and so it was Noah prepared was something that was Far encompassing besides himself it was something that could include others so it was you know so much of the world talks about uh all inclusion all inclusion well I only believe in one thing you should be included in and that's the born to gained experience of a Christian that's what fixes everything but we see that these great people were moved on by faith and and we looked at that a little bit and we began to talk about it and we begin to see that Faith isn't something that we necessarily can have on our own and faith and belief are different things altogether people believe many things you know they believe that the world was clear they believed if you went so fast that you would roll off the Earth or something would happen to you all these different uh beliefs that they had so there's got to be something within the believer that separates belief in faith or comes to the true understanding of what faith really is and I I honestly feel that faith is one of the Mysteries that was kept from all the churches Through the Ages and at this last age that God was going to have a people that he was going to show things reveal things and break understandings too that that ages before us would not be able to accept even though they were great believers they wouldn't be able to accept these great things and he makes this statement he says well that's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong see you've got to learn and we've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means and I I like that because I think that God has something that he's longing for us to accept and as we go a little bit I just uh I'll just take a few moments to um express my heart to you again I think that we received enough food to certainly last us but we want to just fellowship with you this evening mother man makes this statement in the paragraph 122 of works as Faith expressed and that to me it's an astounding statement he says Jesus said that no man can come to me except my father draw him first and all the father hath given me will come to me no man can understand who he is or how it is except be revealed to you by the revelation of God and then faith in that you act accordingly now going back to paragraph 105. now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God if you ever have faith or and really in one way we don't have faith it's not something that we have now it's a great dilemma that we are facing here so we don't have faith it's a gift of God lest any man should boast it's not something you can manufacture it's not something that you can work up that's it's not something that you can Define it it'll be honest with you it's not really something that you can physically share with somebody else I I would love to give you a portion of my grace or I would love to give you some uh some substance that I have here because faith is a substance it's something that you know you possessed it's a a reality to you it's not a perception it it's real to you and it's real to you because it was given to you but it's not something that you have it's uh you can desire for it and you should pray for it and I love the man when Jesus spoke to him and he said can you believe and the man really took a look at his condition and he finally looked at the Lord and said Lord help my unbelief help me Lord what you're talking about I need and if you ever are lacking something in God's word he's always opened a door for you to receive it he says ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you but we we have such a tendency to sit in condemnation because we think of ourselves really higher and above what we are I'm sure that if we were to write our own obituary we would all write ourselves into the kingdom as saints of God I love it when men attach titles to themselves you know I'm an apostle you know I'm a prophet I'm an elder you know I'm an elder in in in the message and uh why we're still children in the message there is so much more of God's word for us to have there's such more more of the spirit of God that we need how you know can we say that we walk in the spirit we talk in the spirit we live in the spirit that we do nothing till God first shows it to us that that as he is so are we in this world herein is the Capstone set forth that as he is so are we in this world and so we we it's not very difficult for anybody to preach to us how short we are I mean that that's a a simple gospel you're all sinners if you don't say you're Sinners you're a liar you know we've all sinned and we all fall short of the glory of God take a look at yourself in the mirror see all your faults and all your shortcomings and come running to the altar you can spend your life at the altar and you'll never be able to get rid of one of the things that you've got bothering you you don't have the ability and and that's what we begin to see in this great quote that we just read just a moment ago he said he said no man can understand in who he is or how it is how it is that what I think if we could just grasp for a few seconds this evening is how is it now your whole definition of how something is is all carnal because you can only are trapped by the five senses that you have to touch taste feel smell here so you you we judge everything through those senses you know it's nothing against that God gave us those they're a gift of God to us those five senses those five inner senses they're God's gift to us but he says they're not meant to lead us he gave them to us to make contact with one another I'm glad when I talked to Ben wall that I can see him and if I don't uh see them and I just talk to them on the phone there's a longing in my heart to see him I I don't like texting people okay Mick there's no contact there there's no census there there's not even hearing there there might be seeing there but I'm given to all the perceptions uh that I have of what that text means and you got to be careful you know I've tried to pull a few people's legs by text you know say something funny or make a comment or anything and they just totally took it out of context and everything and I'm days and months trying to redeem myself but we there's a way that God has and we need to know what it means to accept him and so as we we look at Faith and we read really what it is it's not something you have it's a gift of God and he said no man could come unto me except my father draws him first and all the father hath given me will come to me and no man can understand who he is or how it is except you it be revealed to you by the revelation of God and then Faith acts accordingly I believe brother Tom touched on that this morning but how it is I think that's one of the most beautiful things that has been revealed to us in this day is how that it is how is it how did God choose to do things what was uh his purpose what was his plan how he chose to to touch man and to reach out to man and and to carry out his plan now we read in Ephesians this great scripture that says that we are his workmanship right created unto good works that we should walk in them now what a paradox we don't have faith unless he gives it to us and yet we have good works that were foreordained to walk in now here we find ourselves if I could say that in a situation where we're supposed to accomplish something that we have no ability to accomplish we've been tasked with something that we're unable to accomplish I can't I can't accomplish it I'm foreordained unto good works I don't know what they are I don't know how to to accomplish it I don't have no power to perform them well I am in a fix I'm in a fix I'm ordained to do something yeah yeah I I I'm I'm have good works that I'm supposed to walk in that they they I'm I'm his workmanship I don't even know how that he works I don't know what's going on I'm striving Within Myself to labor to find out what these works are and to accomplish these works and and to to do something that I'm supposed to do I read the Scripture it lays out the things that I'm supposed to do ways that I'm supposed to live and the more that I read it the more that I find out that I can't do this but praise God that's how it is because he has a way he he's he's he's he's put us in the place to wear that we have no righteousness we have no ability there's nothing that we can that we can do we have no ability to do it and yet we can't use our excuses for not doing it oh my God Paul found himself in that spot and finally he said I sought the Lord I sought the Lord I sought the Lord Lord if I would have my eyes fixed Lord if I could do this Lord I could if I could get this done if I could get this done oh what a marvelous program that Paul laid out for his own Deliverance well a lot of times we lay out our deliverance program we lay out other people's salvation program or if they would do this and they would do that and if they would just come to this meeting or if they would just go to the youth meeting or if they would just come here brother such and such preach I just know they'd get saved I had a lady one time come to church and she felt that if her granddaughter could be play the part of Jesus in the manger at our Sunday school Christmas play that her grand her children would get saved and I thought wait a minute there's only one provided place that God meets anybody that's under the shed Bloods but she just so felt in her heart that if she could just get that baby in that manger at that play that they'd be saved now I don't know about you yeah but you don't take a sixth month old baby away from its mother and stick it on a pile of hay and think it's going to sit there and act like an angel beautiful right that's absurd but so many times our minds and our thoughts live in absurdity you know we just simply can't come back to the the place that we realize that we've got to be that we're we're tasked with something that we're unable to accomplish and of course I I couldn't very well let the child be in that I don't know what the other kids would do I don't know what they do with the baby quit crying I I I don't know all the things that could have happened and so I just simply I could simply said you know sis it's just not a very good idea it's just not wise to put this baby in this manger scene in front of all the people and and you know it's just you know uh it's fine I just can't do it oh my goodness I sent her kids to hell and I thought wait a minute come on what makes it work it's nothing we can do it's by grace my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect and weakness so we have a group of people that's foreordained prophesied about and spoken to reach Great Heights and many times we we speak about those things that we are going to be an invincible Army but we can accomplish that we're the last voice in this last stage oh that's that that's a great prophecy but how are we going to get there how are we going to get from point A to point B now we talk about point B we talked about what it is we believe it's existence we we believe that if it's spoken if it it's true but he never Dawns on us that there's a part of this word that's been given to us that how it is how it is how it is that you get from here to there how it is that you get from sickness to health how it is that you get from bondage to Freedom how it is how it is how it is God in this last day has chosen and elect lady to reveal to Earth how it is she's not going to sit in darkness she's not going to sit in wonderment just like he told Elijah take your coats might the thing just like he said take your rod and strike the sea every place that he spoke take the Altar and burn it on fire there's always a how it is for the believer God's already laid out the process he's already spoken to it how it is what he does how that he's going to get this bride how he's going to take her from the church world how he's going to separate her how that he's going to cleanse her yeah it's all it's all there and we're actually sitting in a time where our eyes are actually viewing the very how it is that he spoke he says this great things okay and I love him so much this is how it is but in the face of all this unbelieving doubting age and things that we have went through and live in today that's paragraph 70 of proving his word the worst of all in the face of all this doubt God goes right on proving his word to be right he has in every age so that's how it is how it is it's in the face of doubt it's in the face of evil it's in the face of the most deceptive age that it's ever been he chooses the time to prove his word he does it always when the law of contrast is at its greatest the darker it is the greater the light shine so this is how it is he's he's he he he's not asking us to reason he's not even asking us to understand he just says this is how it is in the face of all unbelief in the time of the great darkness in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God not wishing to retain God in their knowledge that God gives them over to a reprobate mind that is how it is that one Noah by Revelation saw what was coming he moved with fear and prepared himself in heart he didn't know when it was going to start with rain he didn't know how long he was going to preach he didn't know when it was going to be but there's one thing he knew he knew it was going to rain and he acted accordingly because to him that's how it was have we got the how it is down I always like to paint a bed of roses for me I stand in the mirror in the morning and say good morning Hercules you're looking great today and then the truth comes in and says you know dear you'd feel a lot better if you'd lose 25 pounds now I like the perception better and I do the reality but I've got to accept how it is if you're not serving God a hundred percent you will never get any better until you can accept how it is if your backslid you just got to say I'm backslid if you made a mistake I made a mistake the great beautiful part about the scripture is you'll never repent for a mistake you don't think you made and you'll go on living in the deception of your own righteousness which in God's sight is a filthy Ray so you drape yourself with a filthy rag of your own righteousness you go on pretending I really didn't say that I really didn't do this I really didn't mean that and you give a heap full of extra of excuses when the word of God says you stand naked before God the one whom we have to deal with you're not fooling him you know why because he knows how it is he knows who you are why you are where you come from and where you're going it's about time to get with the program I'd like to make contact with the one that knows what's going on we used to teach sales training and we we see so many people they'd walk into the store to sell a project and they'd talk to the checkout Clerk oh this is a great product you ought to have this you know well all she can sit there and say well can I buy a bottle you got to get to the right Source you've got to get to the right guy you've got to get to the man that's got the power another thing we always talk is you had to have a prepared presentation you've got to be able to what are you trying to accomplish what are you trying to say what are you wanting to do and we just heard the other day through the word of God that God prepares he prepares his people he's been preparing you to have the right approach he's been preparing you to know who to go to who it is that gets things done how to approach him what your approach is how to present to him your case what you're asking for you're asking for a sale because instantly in the form of a type so whatever your case is you've got to know what you're presenting you can't go into somebody says now I think this stuff works and I hope it won't damage your material well that ain't gonna fly and yet we're told to approach the throne of grace boldly and and this is what God's been longing for he's been longing for this this seed to mature into the place that they can approach his throne the same way that Jesus did so let's go back this phone and keep reading he said God goes and all doubt goes God goes right on proving his word to be right and he has in every age unbelief doesn't stop God it doesn't hinder him I don't care how much the world unbelieves it's still going to happen unbelief doesn't do anything but condemns the unbeliever the unbelief will send the unbeliever to Hell it'll Rob him of every blessing that God promised to him but it doesn't hinder God from going right on with with the believer see unbelief doesn't stop God it only stops the unbeliever that's how it is now if really think what that means if you could accept that you wouldn't beat your brains out on the unbeliever you wouldn't cast your pearls Before Swine you'd speak the word without fear or favor you would cast your seed knowing that some might fall on this ground some might fall on that ground you don't try to pre-determine you don't try to pre-design you don't try to do this like so many people I see that believe this message they look for a round for some good Pentecostal sister it's got her hair all tied up right and putting on a nice little dress and and look so good and they think that's a candidate well let me tell you she has veiled with such a religious spirit that even raising the dead wouldn't open her eyes but we'll walk past the little person that's tattooed we'll walk past the little person that's got a drug problem we'll walk a past somebody that's through emotional trouble oh we've pre-qualified them that God can help them let me take the easy Road let me find somebody else that looks like they might be able to talk with me why don't we just take the power of the resurrection and present the gospel and give them a chance to believe because it's not going to be given by their faith they don't have faith but the grace of God can give them a revelation I'll guarantee you a 99 of the people in this message would have never brought it to me am I pre-saved condition yet I was screaming on the inside for God I was hungering amen for light I was trapped in a dark tunnel and I had no way out no ability to get out I was a slave nobody got me out he got me out he got me out and when he got me out he got me out I'm never going back there if I come into judgment it won't be for that condition because he burned that prison down though he goes on here and he say it doesn't stop God now listen to this great statement here this is paragraph 72 how does he make his word known to the people how does he do it how is it I I'm serious with us tonight mostly for my church we're happy for the visitors but that's questions to us do we understand how God works do we understand what it means can we recognize him working right I don't want to walk by God doing something great and not give him the honor and glory for it I want I sound that I might see he says how does God make his word known to the believer first God knowing that there would be unbelievers I like that now watch the wisdom of God knowing there would be unbelievers and how the majority would be unbelievers he is by foreknowledge predestinated a seed for every age that would believe it Hallelujah that's how it is he wasn't going to go change the unbelievers they were unbelievers to begin with in his wisdom knowing that there would be unbelievers knowing that would be rejected knowing you didn't have any ability to come out of the darkness you were in because you were born in unbelief you were born in sin which is unbelief came into the world speaking lies you were hopeless but all the wisdom of God I'll put something in them to believe with I'll plant a seed there Oh by his great wisdom by his grace that's how it is that's how it is he said how it is he how God how was God going to get this gospel to the believer how is he going to make his word known in His Infinite Wisdom he was going to put a seed something in there that they could believe with oh the pearl of great price the treasure in the field everything sell all that you have yes that that that's a prized possession that's been given to you that's greater than Mona Lisa it's greater than anything of any value what would a man give in exchange for his soul that seed is the most precious thing on Earth today it's immeasurable it's unvaluable and just to think it might have been sold for 30 pieces of silver he predestinates a seed for every age that would be there now if you'll notice in there for each age goes right on with his word everything right on time nothing hinders God God goes right on every click is moving just exactly right we think sometimes it's not going to work right but don't worry sometimes we just don't think it's going to work right this message just ain't going to work sometimes we give in to things because we don't want to offend this we don't want to offend our uncles we don't want to offend our ants and this is the way we've done it for so long and everything and we actually partake in heathenism heathenism people that confess for heathenism people today said well I want to win this guy to the to the Lord so I'm going to take him to a Cowboy game look if you don't got something to keep you from a Cowboy game how in the world he does he think that he's going to get something for me for from you that he don't have he's got what you got the scripture says come out from amongst them and be ye supper how separated are you you've got a seed you're not looking to change people's minds you're not looking to give them a religious experience you're looking to take the word that's in you and see if it'll Quicken a seed that's in them that's all you're hoping for pre-adventure they have a seed pre-adventure they have enough faith pre-adventure I'm going to testify to them I'm going to tell them that Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7 that God came in this generation and veiled himself in flesh did the same Saints and wonders that Jesus did prey Adventure that there's something inside of them that'll scream amen [Applause] no but we go on their ground we go on their ground actually I could read you quote after quote which I'm going to do I'm going to show the videos on the screen in front of the church so that it's totally understood Beyond any shadow of a doubt this wedding dancing is of the devil it's hedonism I don't care whether you feel you've got to honor your grandfather honor your good the word of God says blessed is he who is not offended in me amen sorry that's how it is I love the dance I was a Dancing Fool oh I couldn't wait for the high school dance because I could do the two-step the three-step the triple step the back flip the splits I could do the the one foot Jim James Brown across the stage you know what I mean oh they'd all stand back and watch me act like a fool it's about time we come fools for Christ but that just how it is because you say well why is that important because we're not going to go any higher you understand that we're not going to go any higher we're not going to climb up we're not going to mature and come we come to the realization of how it is how are we going to get raptured how is it what is it I've got a seed I've been separated out I have something they don't have that's what he said he said the reason they can't accept it is they don't have anything in them to believe with you know that girl one time just walked by that dance hall and before she knew it she was in there and she had a taste for it she remembered all the memories how it felt the anointing of that dancing may I say it again the anointing the religious anointing that comes with it and all the dancing and all the feeling and and all the emotion both and said before she knew it she was in there dancing just like that just like that Spirits get on things at Heathen worship we're not even supposed to eat things that are offered to idols and it just just that quick you say why because it's the inability for people to stand back and look how it is how is it what are they doing there's dancing and then there's dancing what devil put that in your brain what did he say you filter everything through the word of God till there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost I'm not trying to put condemnation on anybody it's time that the church wakes up [Music] he's got something for us he's got something for us that we're going to walk in a foreordained work that we bring destinated to do the question is how do we get there what's her path how did what did he choose to do how did he choose to get us from this terrible condition that we're in so that's so easily to fall from the flesh to sin the scripture says the Sin that so easily besets us the nature that we have the human nature that so rapidly comes to the surface with a little bit of pressure if all the drivers out there that I cursed and sent to the bad place if they were off the road there'd be one or two cars you know you get to the place sometimes you think man I wish you'd just get in a wreck not even realizing that your thoughts speak louder in heaven than the very words that come from your mouth we don't want a reason there's something that we want we want revelation glorious we want the gift of God faith comes by Revelation you don't have faith it's given to you by the grace of God you don't have Revelation you might have conclusion or you might have perception but Revelation is something that the church is supposed to be praying for because it's what God's going to use to move us from A to B to get us to The Works that are foreordained for us and he goes on just to say he says as as we're reading up here he says God will prove it so so he says no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother see if you do God will prove it so because we looked and see the others how can we say then see if it's by the True Believer that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word how many beliefs there's going to be a bride how many believe she's going to be without spot or wrinkle who's he going to prove that by it's not going to be a mystical uh he said there's a bride so she's out there somewhere no he's going to take that word and prove what he said by believers they have a seed so he's got the Quicken that seed is that right he's got to send the word to that seed he's got to bring that seed to life that that seed grows into a fleshly form and now God could say there is my word come to pass that's you now I know what you look at yourself and you think it's impossible but it's not done by you he planned it to be done by grace let's read again a little bit we'll close now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers then in order to have Believers to meet that word he has got to predestinate it to that age you see it why am I here what what is he transforming me into he's transformed me from what I am to what that he wants me to be he's doing it I can't do it but the one thing I can know is that he's made it known to me how it is this is how it is he plants the seed to be there to receive the promise and then he brings that seed to life he said you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age do you get it do you feel it do you see it do you understand it right that's what's happening today this is how it is are you seeing it do you feel it I actually sometimes wonder do I really feel that Seed Life in me and how separated I am from the world and how God's actually working on me to transform me and take me out of this world into a kingdom I haven't seen yet okay that's what we're here for we're here to leave we're the Rapture the rapture's on you're part of it he's transforming you that's where we're not part of the world we're in the world we're not of the world I don't care what else is going on the unbelief don't stop God he said it that's the way it's going to be he's going to have a people in The Bride I'm part of that person and if I'm not a light for that time I'm a part of those that come out of the Grave I don't know what part I'm going to play but I'm going to play the part he's predestinated for me to play don't you love them yeah because he said he said and that's what's happening today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge and when he predestinated in Malachi 4 5 it's got to happen when he came over and predestinated anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestinates anything to happen or says it'll happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestinated it by his foreknowledge see then there's nothing going to stop it isn't that wonderful you know he says in God's power to transform he says it's not the word that quickened it's the spirit that quickens I I had that quote and I I lost it and I'm just going to pretend but I want you to think about it for a moment he says he sent the Spirit to Quicken the word he said when the life that's in the spirit meets the life that's in the seed it will produce what that seed was to be so now here we are we've got the seed he has got to send the spirit to meet the life and the seed because without that Spirit without that quickening without that revelation of faith without God showing you by grace you can't achieve it people can read the books see what's there but they're in capable of achieving it we're trying to achieve it through Revival and brother Branham preached and told us that in this last day there would be a false Revival they try to achieve it by an outpouring of gifts which is wonderful It's a Great Taste Of Glory goodbye but it doesn't produce it there's only one thing that produces it s revelation by grace it's God opening your eyes and letting you see it nothing you can do you're helpless you're just sitting there helpless you can actually know it's being like like being paralyzed and laying in bed and having a great desire to get out of bed and walk and you you hear that there's all these works that you can do and all these things you're supposed to be able to accomplish and all these great things that's laid before you but yet you're paralyzed you can do nothing until he comes down reveals to you that you're healed and then he quickens that and makes it come alive oh that's the beautiful that's the super sign God present with us quickening his word and making it come flesh Church we're on the verge of the greatest thing that we've ever been part of it and it's going to be accomplished not by us but by him by faith by a gift of God by Revelation by making himself good he says he proves his word all of his words just think of it all of his word and you were his word he was the word and you were part of his word and that's the reason you're sent here to confirm your place in this life that's something to confirm your place in this life Lord what am I here for I'm here to be in the rapture okay maybe I got a few years I don't know if I'll be here but I'll confirm that my voice is going to cry out he's coming and the Grave's not going to hold this body down one day I'll Fly Away there's a kingdom I'm going to there's a land beyond the river I believe it with all my heart I'm trusting in it I'm going to live according the word struck me I'm going to separate myself from unbelief oh even so come quickly Lord Jesus cleanse me from all unrighteousness Lord put it in my mind give me that thinking man's filter set my soul on Fire Lord this is how it is how is it by election he put a seed and he quickens it by his word no other way but his way amen I'm happy because despite all that I am he picked me not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord I'm one of them I'm one of them no someone look at me and say you can't be one of them yeah you're probably what you're seeing can't be but that's not how it is how it is he put a seed there because he knew there would be unbelief and he knew if he didn't put that seed there I would go the way of the unbeliever if he didn't put that seed there I wouldn't accept this message if he didn't put this seed there I wouldn't know he's the same yesterday today and forever if he didn't put that seed there I could do nothing and if he didn't Quicken that secede with his spirit and make it come alive all I could do is believe unto believe unto believe unto I believe he's a Healer but Lord reveal to me by faith and Grace my healing that what I believe might become flesh the separation of believing in faith is all in his hands right it's all in his hands and the prophet says above all things pray for revelation pray to have it made real pray for it to be quickened don't condemn yourself don't put yourself on the outside there's a deep inside of you calling Lord I want it to be real I want it to be real and I'll share this with you in closing and maybe I've shared it with you before but I used to listen to those tapes brother Ben was healing this person and healing that person and I I was 21 years old again I was cutting Timber and I was this solid as a rock and alls I wanted to do was be healed Lord Heal Me I wanna I wanna feel healing I wanted to feel healing you know how it is when you're a child you think as a child I never realized I had to get sick before I could get healed how was it I was a spitting image of Health I could run up a mountain in a pair of spikes chop down a tree walked down that tree saw all the limbs up cut it up in a bunch of logs grabbed my saw and run over to the next tree shovel the stump all the way down I'm telling you I was as hard as this pulpit I felt good I thought I looked good so I said oh God heal me God heal me oh I want to be healed I want to be healed I just want to be healed I want to experience that I wanted to experience it walking right over everything he'd been doing for me set me in the mountains of Montana being able to hunt and fish and everything was glorious and I just never remember one day I'm working out there and I'm hooking logs up for the the the skid loader to pull him up and he put this log off of the a log and all of a sudden this sapling was laying under that log and that sapling come up just like a catapult and it come right up here and caught me in my arm my hand was like that it broke my thumb caught me under the arm took my arm out a joint flew it up in the air I couldn't work now I needed healing now I needed healing now it become a reality and I was in a meeting and now I couldn't work and I finally looked out and said oh God heal me and I got so desperate I just threw my hands up in the air and I said oh God heal me my hands was up my thumbs were out I was going Heal Me Lord Heal Me Lord and all of a sudden I was healed nothing I did of course I learned a great lesson realize how it is how it was is I was well and I should have thanked God for it I should have recognized where I was at and the condition that I was in and not been ashamed because I could say this if you're backslid don't be ashamed don't be ashamed ask for Revelations ask God to give you faith to overcome it's nothing you can do you don't have it it has to be given alls God wants to see is if you want it do you really want to be raptured then act accordingly do you really want to be separated from the things of the world then ask him to show you what world is in your life he promised he wouldn't leave you or forsake you he promised he would supply all your needs he's with supplied he take care of you if you're sick and the doctors can't help you ask for revelation pray for revelation can't emphasize to the church enough how important it is to pay pray for Revelation because Revelation is faith it's a gift of God lest any of us should boast it's nothing you can do it's something he gives you by his grace Lord move in me all the senses are great but they're not given to lead you the church is built upon Revelation it's not built upon one Revelation one time it's not how you build a building no other greater Foundation can any man lay but let every man watch how he builds on that Foundation whether it's wood hay or stubble what do we put on our foundation by Revelation to Revelation faith upon faith upon Faith that's how God's builds the church that's how it is that's how the Rapture is that's how we're going to get in the Rapture that's how we're going to get from point A to point B he's going to reveal to us reveal to us we're going to walk he's going to reveal we're going to walk he's going to reveal we're going to walk he's going to reveal you know it all no I haven't even begin to know it but what happens there's a seed in me that he can Quicken there's a life in me that he can Quicken he can come by and the spirit of the word meets the spirit meets the spirit of the word it'll produce the life Spirit strike the word
