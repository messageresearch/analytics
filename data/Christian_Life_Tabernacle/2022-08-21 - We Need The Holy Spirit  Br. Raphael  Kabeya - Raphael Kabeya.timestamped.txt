[15:00] as we begin to just open the service in
[15:02] prayer
[15:05] i was fellowshipping with my wife before
[15:07] the service and she read this quote it
[15:09] said
[15:10] the power of the church is to come
[15:12] together and pray
[15:15] what an opportunity that is presented
[15:18] for us right now is to come together
[15:22] as touching anything that it might be
[15:24] bound in earth as it is in heaven amen
[15:26] we just
[15:28] want to open the service in prayer and
[15:29] also take up the tithes and offerings at
[15:31] this time
[15:33] my brother rod ridpath writes that a
[15:35] co-worker has lost his son in a
[15:38] work-related accident so we just want to
[15:42] remember this family
[15:44] i pray that
[15:46] brother rob can be
[15:48] one that can connect them
[15:51] with christ during this time
[15:54] many times it's
[15:55] it's in tragedy it's in suffering it's
[15:57] in pain
[15:59] that we experience the love of god and
[16:01] that he's
[16:02] he can comfort like no one else can
[16:04] comfort amen
[16:05] we just pray that he'd be the
[16:08] portion and just continue to remember
[16:10] sister rebecca and her unspoken prayer
[16:13] request
[16:14] amen i'm just gonna ask brother cosman
[16:16] to come and
[16:18] open the service in prayer
[16:23] i just pray that you would remember
[16:26] me and brother cosman as lord willing we
[16:28] leave tuesday to go
[16:30] be with brother gabriel and some
[16:31] meetings there in romania
[16:34] i'm just thankful for that opportunity
[16:36] to get over the service of prayer and
[16:38] pray for the tithes and offerings in
[16:39] these requests
[16:40] [Music]
[16:43] it's just our hearts together
[16:46] like matthew said let's just pray
[16:48] together as a body
[16:51] lord heavenly father
[16:53] lord we can stand here lord for eternity
[16:56] and just talk about your goodness
[16:58] lord talk about your grace and how you
[17:01] just
[17:02] took us on the road and
[17:04] how you walked side by side with us lord
[17:07] and
[17:08] lord how do you showed us the things of
[17:09] the bible and how you reveal to us the
[17:12] secrets of this our lord

[17:16] lord what a privilege it is to just be
[17:18] able to
[17:19] stand in your true presence lord
[17:23] lord we could grow and
[17:26] just recognize you that you're on the
[17:28] scene
[17:29] [Music]
[17:30] lord we're so thankful we're not bound
[17:32] to religion until things of this world
[17:34] and
[17:35] lord that we're free in the spirit lord
[17:37] and we're able to just
[17:38] freely worship you in spirit and in
[17:40] truth
[17:42] so we're here tonight lord and one mind
[17:45] and one accord asking for your word to
[17:47] come forth
[17:48] lord asking that you would come and
[17:51] lord present your truth to us tonight
[17:54] lord where it's able to take us to
[17:56] another level of maturity
[17:58] and lord as that word just becomes flesh
[18:01] lord i ask that you just take it and put
[18:02] it in our heart
[18:04] let it be real so when we walk out of
[18:06] here lord it could be a living word
[18:08] the only way we can be a living word
[18:10] lord is if we actually live the word
[18:12] lord i don't want it just to be dead
[18:15] words coming out of my mouth i don't
[18:16] want to just be theory or theology or
[18:18] whatever man can call it lord i want to
[18:21] be in power and demonstration like paul
[18:23] said lord lord i want to be
[18:26] a son of god and lord i know every
[18:29] heart's desire this more this evening
[18:31] lord is to just be able to be a true
[18:33] son and daughter of god

[18:37] lord even for the needs that were
[18:39] brought before you
[18:41] lord i i pray for
[18:43] the co-worker brother robert
[18:46] lord in the situation that was unspoken
[18:49] request for sister rebecca lord
[18:51] lord you're the discerner of the heart
[18:53] and
[18:54] you know all things from the beginning
[18:57] and we know that everything that you
[18:59] allow to happen is for a purpose and for
[19:01] it's for a reason
[19:02] and the only reason is for you to
[19:04] develop the character that we need to
[19:06] have to overcome to
[19:08] to get to the other side lord so i
[19:10] prayed that
[19:12] you just go by and your word could
[19:14] deliver and your work could provide and
[19:16] your work could just be able to be the
[19:17] one that actually has power over all
[19:20] things
[19:21] because whatever we do let it be in word

[49:47] i'd like to
[49:48] recommend every children into your hands

[49:55] of the day foreign
[49:59] [Music]
[50:13] [Music]
[50:21] [Music]
[50:24] ourselves
[50:27] [Music]
[50:32] in the name of jesus christ
[50:54] let's read acts chapter 2
[50:57] verse
[50:58] 37.
[51:06] school
[51:16] now when they had heard
[51:18] this
[51:19] they were pricked in their heart and
[51:21] they said unto peter and to the rest of
[51:24] the apostle
[51:25] men and brethren what shall we do
[51:38] then peter said unto them repent and be
[51:40] baptized every one of you in the name of
[51:44] jesus christ for the remission of your
[51:46] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[51:49] the holy ghost
[51:51] [Music]
[51:58] for the promises unto you and unto your
[52:01] children
[52:02] and
[52:03] and to all of all that are far off and
[52:06] even as many as our lord
[52:08] god shall call could you be like may the
[52:11] lord bless the reading of his word
[52:14] you may have your seats
[52:32] i would like to just uh brush off
[52:36] a subject that's very important for our
[52:40] believers
[52:55] and the reason why i'm touching this
[52:57] subject that's great and important in
[52:59] the scriptures
[53:04] because you couldn't receive the holy
[53:06] ghost
[53:07] of the pastor
[53:08] if you don't know what it is
[53:17] and you wouldn't receive it if you if
[53:19] you don't know it which it was given to
[53:21] you and it's for you
[53:23] even
[53:25] and you cannot receive them
[53:44] unless you know what result he will the
[53:46] holy ghost will produce
[53:50] if you can understand these three things
[53:54] correctly
[54:03] you will contend yourself or you will be
[54:05] happy with a substitute or with an
[54:07] imitation
[54:20] when this gospel will be preaching the
[54:23] whole world as to be a testimony of me
[54:27] then the end will come
[54:33] when when the gospel will be preached in
[54:36] all the world
[54:38] what does that mean
[54:43] it doesn't mean to spread out
[54:45] literatures
[54:50] alire to send missionaries
[54:53] to send missionaries here and there to
[54:56] teach people how to read and how to
[54:58] write
[55:02] and to try to distribute some thoughts
[55:05] about the bible
[55:09] and to bring people to an understanding
[55:11] that is in existence of a god
[55:17] if that's all that you need in order to
[55:20] spread the gospel i love jesus
[55:23] and then that means jesus already come
[55:25] and the end has already come back
[55:30] to life
[55:34] because all the literatures all the the
[55:36] teachings and all the things that's been
[55:38] sent in all the world already
[55:41] but paul says
[55:45] that the gospel didn't come by words
[55:47] only
[55:51] with power and demonstration of the holy
[55:53] ghost
[55:55] then when jesus said
[56:00] that go
[56:13] and to show who god is and what he's
[56:15] capable of doing
[56:17] glory be to our lord
[56:20] to demonstrate the power of god
[56:24] the power of the gospel
[56:27] to take the word montreal
[56:44] that's how people can follow the word as
[56:46] something of a match substance
[56:54] no one has the right to preach the
[56:56] gospel
[57:01] unless he is first sanctified of the
[57:04] worries and the things of the world
[57:08] people go in all the world legends
[57:18] they themselves full of all the worries
[57:21] of the world and all kinds of things in
[57:23] the self person defense they don't know
[57:25] how to take care of them
[57:28] but they stand before people
[57:31] so they can preach them the good news
[57:34] that themselves need
[57:36] contrast that's the
[57:38] contrast of the paradox that's the
[57:40] paradox
[57:42] and that kind of uh uh gospel napoleoni
[57:45] will not bring anything and see in focus
[57:52] and
[57:54] those people have to come to a place
[57:57] where those things are taken off of them
[58:02] so they can bring a living gospel to the
[58:05] people
[58:07] and if you have people like that in your
[58:09] point
[58:10] there are no there is no unbelievers in
[58:13] your point of psychology there won't be
[58:15] any uh psychology
[58:18] justification there is no justification
[58:23] yeah there there are no scholars in the
[58:26] world
[58:28] that can stop that kind of gospel
[58:33] that person was there by experience when
[58:36] that happened
[58:40] he knows what happened and he knows what
[58:42] he's talking about
[58:44] satan's
[58:45] not remember
[58:48] that's how
[58:49] our prophet could be justified
[58:55] and to have a uh somewhat of an
[58:57] understanding of every individual who's
[58:59] born again
[59:01] says
[59:06] and i believe he says i believe now that
[59:08] the blessings will follow the believers
[59:12] are you a believer
[59:16] then blessings have to follow you
[59:20] in all the moments of life
[59:23] in the highest and the lows
[59:27] you are a woman or a man or a woman
[59:29] who's blessed
[59:40] regardless of the fights
[59:44] regardless of the things that comes uh
[59:46] uh uh against me malchet constance
[59:50] regardless of all the circumstances
[59:52] around me
[59:55] that i never been sorry to be a
[59:57] christian
[1:00:05] and i believe it's the same with every
[1:00:06] single one of you
[1:00:12] jesus
[1:00:14] oh the chimes have ringed in my heart
[1:00:17] since jesus came and entered into my
[1:00:19] heart genesis
[1:00:22] i never been able to express it
[1:00:27] it's it's a grace
[1:00:29] it's a it's a it's a joy that can never
[1:00:31] be expressed and full of glory
[1:00:35] guarding us
[1:00:37] being a reality
[1:00:59] you're not going to be today at the
[1:01:01] mountaintop and tomorrow down in the
[1:01:03] valley and defeated
[1:01:07] you will always be happy regardless of
[1:01:09] what happened
[1:01:14] happy because everything all things work
[1:01:17] together for the good of them they love
[1:01:19] him
[1:01:24] you will always hold to the right
[1:01:26] regardless of what happens
[1:01:30] you will always hold to the right
[1:01:33] the apostle paul says
[1:01:55] it can never be defeated
[1:01:57] you believe that
[1:01:59] parliament speaking of the holy ghost
[1:02:07] is to touch on the one of the most
[1:02:10] significant and important subject for
[1:02:12] every believer
[1:02:16] then there's also a difference andre and
[1:02:18] critical
[1:02:32] professing to be a believer a christian
[1:02:37] he makes a lot of noise that are
[1:02:39] centered upon himself
[1:02:42] he's uh he's pretentious
[1:02:46] he doesn't have the fear of god
[1:02:49] you can observe that
[1:02:54] a christian who believes is something
[1:02:56] and he's able to do a lot of things
[1:03:00] he talks a lot nepal can't do he doesn't
[1:03:02] have the fear of god
[1:03:04] explicit he knows how to explain
[1:03:06] everything
[1:03:08] and he wants to be listened by everybody
[1:03:12] that's not the christianity
[1:03:14] no prophet
[1:03:15] a prophet a prophet one time distributed
[1:03:17] glenn this is a leader he was talking i
[1:03:19] was uh debating or uh discussing with
[1:03:22] his uh friend brother levi
[1:03:25] believe he don't initial the sentence
[1:03:28] about the initial evidence of the holy
[1:03:30] ghost
[1:03:34] they found that the the most evident uh
[1:03:37] evidence of the holy ghost sila move was
[1:03:40] love
[1:03:41] see
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:23] it's not a ministry with a specialized
[1:04:26] or determined calling judas
[1:04:29] judas had a specialized and defined
[1:04:31] calling yeah seymour so i can't follow
[1:04:34] him
[1:04:35] he knew the day
[1:04:36] and she looked doctor
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:51] that when the holy ghost will come upon
[1:04:53] you
[1:04:57] he will remind you the things that i
[1:04:59] have taught you
[1:05:02] and it will tell you of things that are
[1:05:03] to come
[1:05:06] and that's what the true evidence of the
[1:05:08] holy ghost
[1:05:11] it's to be able to believe the word and
[1:05:14] to receive it
[1:05:18] to have a heart that's constantly
[1:05:21] burning for the word
[1:05:22] fatigue
[1:05:24] not to be tired and to stay home
[1:05:27] this morning
[1:05:29] the church was full
[1:05:31] there was no space mr swan but tonight
[1:05:37] the room is almost empty leave those
[1:05:40] dissented the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:05:46] to the world
[1:06:02] and something
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:17] loyal and they can come and ask
[1:06:19] themselves a question
[1:06:25] the ones that can come in to even doubt
[1:06:27] about themselves
[1:06:29] she's sick in some unreality in what
[1:06:31] they are in reality just to pretend the
[1:06:33] cornell sentence
[1:06:35] not to come to
[1:06:36] uh some type of uh guessing that you
[1:06:40] have the holy ghost
[1:06:43] but you you you you come to the
[1:06:46] understanding by looking at the word
[1:06:51] the word in regards to the life that you
[1:06:53] are leaving yourself first second circle
[1:06:56] because everyone we know you you know
[1:06:58] yourself okay
[1:07:01] if we can come to that questioning
[1:07:08] we can receive the holy ghost in very
[1:07:10] little time just like in pentecost
[1:07:14] they didn't have a series of meetings
[1:07:18] just one meeting down you know tens of
[1:07:20] minutes in about 15 minutes
[1:07:23] and everyone was baptized with the holy
[1:07:25] ghost
[1:07:26] it
[1:07:39] not think about it
[1:08:23] english
[1:08:28] you know like the world warnings in a
[1:08:29] note no it's not
[1:08:32] you're having all your tears and all
[1:08:34] everything coming out
[1:08:36] that's good
[1:08:39] i saw that in the line in the prayer
[1:08:41] line
[1:08:42] people were crying it's yellow they were
[1:08:45] removing the
[1:08:47] snow basket
[1:08:49] because they wanted something
[1:08:52] you understand that
[1:08:54] and the true birth
[1:08:57] it's always a mess
[1:09:00] it's always a mess
[1:09:02] right lupus
[1:09:04] the
[1:09:12] you cannot bring someone to see the word
[1:09:14] of god unless his nature is changed the
[1:09:17] seculity are
[1:09:26] and the holy ghost gets in him when he
[1:09:28] sees the word if he sees the words
[1:09:34] and this battle now is for him to bring
[1:09:36] his life in line with the word vascular
[1:09:39] sentence because the holy ghost
[1:09:42] is the author of the word
[1:09:45] he will tie you to the word you don't
[1:09:48] make any efforts
[1:09:50] regardless of your weaknesses
[1:09:54] you'll find out that regardless of that
[1:09:56] you have to leave what the word says
[1:09:59] yes
[1:10:08] the anointing that they feel during the
[1:10:10] preaching
[1:10:12] atmosphere
[1:10:15] when they see an atmosphere boiling
[1:10:18] atmosphere when people are screaming
[1:10:20] what they see
[1:10:22] when they see signs and wonders
[1:10:24] following their ministry
[1:10:26] zone shows they think they have the
[1:10:28] thing
[1:10:36] they will not understand this message
[1:10:38] because this message it's god himself to
[1:10:40] message this message cecilia's sentence
[1:10:56] your prophet says totally manifestation
[1:10:59] of the benediction all the manifestation
[1:11:01] of the blessings
[1:11:03] it's not the uh it's not the evidence of
[1:11:06] the holy ghost no no
[1:11:07] no it's not
[1:11:13] you don't have to vent yourself or to
[1:11:15] lift yourself up for those
[1:11:16] manifestations because you that's his
[1:11:18] career because judas is carrying it
[1:11:20] honestly he had oh he had also those
[1:11:22] manifestations
[1:11:41] regardless of what he has to do
[1:11:44] that people may may be with him or not
[1:11:48] he will stand with the bible
[1:11:53] you have to remember that the bible is
[1:11:55] the truth
[1:11:57] and the truth
[1:12:01] or will set you free
[1:12:04] that's exactly what jesus said
[1:12:21] i cannot necessarily tell you that the
[1:12:22] prophet says this in this book
[1:12:25] but i'm preaching to you what he said
[1:12:28] what branham says
[1:12:34] it was also the answer to matthew uh
[1:12:37] chapter 7 verse 21 to 23.
[1:12:42] those that will say lord lord no
[1:12:45] they will not enter into the kingdom of
[1:12:48] god
[1:12:51] but only those that will do the will of
[1:12:53] my father
[1:12:54] who's in the heaven
[1:12:57] and the will of the father
[1:12:59] is his word
[1:13:02] many will say unto me that day
[1:13:05] lord lord
[1:13:07] prophet
[1:13:08] have we not prophesy by your name
[1:13:11] in your name
[1:13:13] not in the name of burnham no but
[1:13:16] in your name
[1:13:44] openly
[1:14:05] jesus didn't deny that they did the
[1:14:07] wonderful signs and things that only
[1:14:10] people can do that are led by
[1:14:12] that
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:50] um
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:19] producing miracles by the power of the
[1:15:22] holy ghost
[1:15:25] and they were lifting themselves up with
[1:15:27] them what comes with you oh when i come
[1:15:29] let me rock the mirror
[1:15:31] you will see what god is going to do
[1:15:34] have you ever seen jesus do that
[1:15:39] uh sicilian and that's why
[1:15:43] manifestation we cannot pretend that the
[1:15:46] manifestation
[1:15:48] is the proof that you are born of the
[1:15:51] spirit wrong plea the spirit fulfilled
[1:15:53] with the spirit no miss you no no no
[1:15:56] mister
[1:15:57] zurich
[1:15:59] manifestation i recognize that the true
[1:16:02] manifestation ella proved the sentence
[1:16:04] completely
[1:16:06] is the proof that the holy ghost can do
[1:16:09] powerful works messenger
[1:16:11] land dvd but it's not to prove that the
[1:16:14] individual
[1:16:16] esprit is filled with a spirit meme dvds
[1:16:20] even if that individual who said the
[1:16:22] manifestation on abundance uh here's the
[1:16:25] manifestation in abundance
[1:16:32] because
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:34] he let his rain fall on the just and the
[1:16:36] angels
[1:16:38] he's god in this sovereignty
[1:16:42] the evidence that we have the holy ghost
[1:16:46] is to be able
[1:17:11] they're always uh nourishing or feeding
[1:17:14] the white dogs
[1:17:27] regardless of what the person done
[1:17:30] don't have negative thinking about that
[1:17:32] person

[1:22:36] ohio avenue
[1:22:38] avenue when the holy ghost came to me
[1:22:43] it answered the question about being mad
[1:22:48] and we know that
[1:22:50] being mad that is of the devil
[1:22:54] we know that
[1:22:55] that uh getting mad
[1:22:58] is of the devil
[1:23:00] is that true
[1:23:02] and often time we get madonna
[1:23:48] in accepting what's being spoken here
[1:23:50] because it's the holy ghost speaking
[1:23:53] i was saying
[1:23:56] i said it's something i was born with
[1:24:00] even if your father was getting mad all
[1:24:02] the time

[1:31:21] whereas or heard the word of god being
[1:31:22] preached
[1:31:23] the feminism and the message of william
[1:31:28] it's a supernatural
[1:31:33] it's a message that god that god himself

[1:32:10] he could use so the church could be
[1:32:12] blessed
[1:32:14] and now
[1:32:17] let me tell you something that brother
[1:32:18] branham said
[1:32:22] you are you christians are here
[1:32:29] don't ever stop even one second because
[1:32:32] of the devil
[1:32:34] the devil is there looking for us
[1:32:38] the devil is there all over trying to
[1:32:40] talk to us
[1:32:42] he's there uh
[1:32:44] moving and going around us
[1:32:47] but the prophet said
[1:32:49] you christians that are here
[1:32:52] you know
[1:33:31] you just have to believe god over here
[1:33:34] you see
[1:33:48] but all i know
[1:33:51] is to believe them because he said them
[1:33:56] and i have seen him confirm a lot of
[1:33:58] things
[1:34:00] that no man can do and she just said
[1:34:02] then i know
[1:34:04] that the word the message is true in
[1:34:06] particular
[1:34:08] regardless of what people do with the
[1:34:10] message
[1:34:12] the message remains pure
[1:34:16] we cannot uh
[1:34:30] now i'm finishing
[1:34:34] difference don't let the indifference
[1:34:42] don't let the the reasoning or the
[1:34:45] critical spirit become your state yeah
[1:34:47] the young kid even in different with
[1:34:49] people becoming different
[1:34:54] they always have something to criticize
[1:34:58] it becomes their state of being
[1:35:01] when you meet him
[1:35:03] when he opens his mouth
[1:35:05] it's not edifying to you
[1:35:09] don't listen to that
[1:35:57] just believe what god said because it's
[1:36:00] the truth
[1:36:03] the the holy ghost will lead you onto
[1:36:05] all righteousness unexamined
[1:36:08] in examining your
[1:36:10] as a christian
[1:36:13] you know where it's not okay
[1:36:16] i don't know
[1:36:18] the pastor
[1:36:21] in the light of the world
[1:36:50] he
[1:37:04] don't let those evil spirit come upon
[1:37:06] you and and uh to bring you into a state
[1:37:10] where you become mad
[1:37:14] don't don't have uh uh bitterness in
[1:37:17] your heart the african universe
[1:37:28] so he can lack his holy spirit and to
[1:37:30] come in there's your crown and i believe
[1:37:32] the sentence
[1:37:33] that the holy ghost is here
[1:37:36] in his power
[1:37:39] is the husband who's able
[1:37:43] is this marvelous man
[1:38:00] is here
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:42] god is able
[1:39:09] that we may place ourselves under the
[1:39:11] blood of the lord jesus christ
[1:39:13] this message of the hour
[1:39:15] and believe because it says that under
[1:39:18] the message of the hour
[1:39:20] all our sins are purified
[1:39:23] i believe i i invite our pastor right
[1:39:25] now
[1:39:28] may the hand of the lord be with you
[1:39:30] as you have your hand lifted up
[1:39:33] the pastor will pray for
[1:39:38] you you love the lord
[1:39:42] you know

[1:39:46] sense
