Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 11th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

And certainly the brothers that are taking the offerings. Amen. Put a band if you could just come and take those needs. Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we humbly come before you once more, Lord. with many requests upon our hearts. Lord Jesus, you've heard them as they've gone forth. Lord, there's not an answer man can give that is better than what you can provide. Lord, we're trusting, Lord, in you because you said in your word, your promise that if we bring all our cares upon you, you take the load. Lord, you said cast your burden upon me, Lord. Sometimes the yoke is too heavy for us, Lord. But if we could give it to you. We weren't made to bear it, Lord. But we were made to surrender it all to you. The one that's got the answers for everything, Lord Jesus. We see the attack on our sister Genie. Lord, the devil's fighting, but we know our God is greater. We know our God is stronger, Lord Jesus. And you work all things for our good, Lord Jesus. Sometimes we have to change how we talk, Lord. It's not this happened to me, but this happened for me, Lord. For you do everything for our betterment, Lord Jesus. We just surrender everything in your hands, Lord. You saw all the uplifted hands that were raised, Lord Jesus. You see the hearts of everyone that is in this house, Lord. Those that are not but have the desire to be here, Lord Jesus. You see their hearts, Father. We want to lift them up now as well, Lord Jesus. And we ask as the word goes forth, Lord Jesus, may we open our minds, our hearts, Lord, let the word sink down deep on the inside, Father, and take your mind, Lord Jesus. It's too late of an hour to be messing around. Father, it's time for soldiers to stand at their post of duty and fight the good fight, Lord. We love you, Lord. We pray for the tithes and the offerings. Lord, bless those that are able to give, Lord Jesus. and give work and jobs to those that have a desire to but aren't able to. Lord, that we might be able to give, Lord, for the furtherance of your kingdom, Lord. We're all looking for that last one, Lord Jesus. And maybe it's the last dollar in our pocket that'll be able to support to get somebody to receive the word, Lord Jesus. Help us have a giving heart, Lord Jesus. Be cheerful in all that we do, Lord. We surrender the rest of the time into your hands, Lord. Giving you full preeminence. have your way, Lord Jesus. There's such an atmosphere, Lord, that comes in moments like these, Lord. It's not because of the noise that you're here, Lord Jesus. But it's because you promised in your word where two or three are gathered, you'd be in our midst, Lord. We know in whom we're standing before, Father. So, we have complete trust knowing the King of Kings is here. The Amen is here, Lord Jesus. So, what can stand against, Lord? We love you, Lord. We ask all these things in the wonderful, precious, mighty, gracious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. F. The blood that Jesus shed for me way back on high calary. Oh, and a cloud that gives me strength from day to day. Oh, we will never lose it. Oh, and for he reaches to the highest mountain. Oh, let it flow to the Lord with mighty above. and gives me strength from day to day. He will never lose it. Oh, and it's my doubt and cause my fear and it all my feet. Oh, and of thy kiss me straight from day to day. For you will hallelujah for we reach to the high. this mountain to the Lord mighty. The blood that gives me strength from day to day. He will lay her loose. Just sing it one more time. Oh, for it reaches to the highest mountain. Oh mighty flow might be the blood that gives me strength from day to day. He will never lose his power. Hallelujah. All there's a fountain and that is flowing. Oh, and from a place called Calary and his Let's all stand as we sing it. that you let's sing it as we pass all we Oh, I should I was hallelujah. All angels came outside. Oh, this fountain for me. Heat. Heat. Amen. Thank you, Father. Lord, we're so thankful that there's cleansing power in the blood. And Father, that blood takes it to the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more. flowing from Calvar's mountain. Oh Lord, we're so grateful. We ask you to bless us this evening in our time of fellowship. We ask it in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn uh to uh the uh book of uh First Kings, the 19th chapter. And we just want to start at the uh ninth verse. uh n Kings 19 and he says, "And he came hither unto a cave and lodged there, and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him,"What dust thou hear, Elijah? And he said, "I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts. For the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, have thrown down thine altars, and slain the prophets with the sword. And I, even I only am left, and they seek my life to take it away. And he said, "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord, and behold, the Lord passs by, and a great and strong wind the mountains, and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind." And after the wind, an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice. And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantel and went out and stood in the entering of the cave. And behold, there came a voice unto him, saying, What dust thou hear, Elijah? And he said, "I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts, because the Lord of Israel hath forsaken thy covenant, tore down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I only am left, and seek my life, and they seek my life to take it away." Amen. You may be seated. Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word. Uh we if you follow the story farther Elijah finds out that he had that 7,000 had not bowed their knee to the Lord. But I just wanted to to uh I want to listen to this evening. Uh we're just going to listen to about 45 minutes of the tape that we referred to this morning, the way back. And I I I just thought in that scripture how beautiful that it is because he says that God wasn't in all the thunders and all the mountains and the wind and the fire and all those things, but he was in the still small voice. And even when the Lord moves in a mighty way, &gt;&gt; uh we could have a wonderful worship service. We could uh we could have an anointed ministry that you you just know it's the anointing of God and it just encourages you and and and raises you up and sets you on fire. But in all that, if there's not a still small voice &gt;&gt; in that speaking to you, it'll never take effect. &gt;&gt; And even when you when you're listening to a minister preach and if he's under the anointing or whatever style that he has, I I listen to some ministers, they they've just got a humor that just gets you and and and and you enjoy the word or or they're a deep teacher. It doesn't matter what that it is. When it all comes down to, it comes down to what is speaking to you from the inside out &gt;&gt; because God works on the inside. &gt;&gt; And so you we've got to just if I can say that is understand as we listen uh to this message that the messenger is going to preach. You know, I I I I just see how he just starts out preaching and then how he just comes into the anointing and the words just coming forth. But it doesn't do you any good if if it doesn't raise up and you don't hear that still small voice speaking to you. And that's why that sometimes brother Brandon makes the most profound statements and deep statements in just the calmst, mildest, casual way. &gt;&gt; He'd just be talking and he'll say something that's just absolutely &gt;&gt; if you stop and think, &gt;&gt; "Wow, that's unbelievable. And and what does that is the still small voice. And so that it as we're talking about that each of you have that still small voice because each of you have that inner man on the inside that that that voice of conscience that God put there to speak to you. And you don't want to substitute that for anything. So it doesn't matter the the the type of ministry. It doesn't matter whether it's evangelistic, whether it's teaching, whether it's pastorial or whatever type of the teaching, whatever power that it comes into or how it stimulates you intellectually, emotionally, all those things are fine. But along with that, &gt;&gt; you have to have the still small voice. &gt;&gt; That thing that begins to talk to you on the inside when something said and it brings you under conviction and and and you got that's where God is. He's in the still small voice speaking to you. The wonderful still small voice. and and uh sometimes it comes in conviction, sometimes it comes in many different ways. Sometimes it's just something inside you saying you know you're not doing right or also it's something it's an uncction that says you ought to do this, you ought to do that. So as we listen to this, I know we are believers here, so we know we're going to hear the truth. But along with listening, listen, &gt;&gt; you you know what I mean? So listen for the still small voice. And and you know, I I'm a I'm a firm believer in in the storehouse. I just have to be honest with you that that uh you know that God he knew there would be a famine in the land so he stored up spiritual food that we can we can go back and and in this hour that we live in there's there there's not a question because he preserved to us the voice and and he and you know we think sometimes science science is is all for Satan. Now, God, he he allowed the science &gt;&gt; so he could capture the voice for us. So, I can sit here today and listen to the voice of God &gt;&gt; and and through that voice listen to the still small voice and and let God speak to you. I believe the tape's a couple hours long. There's tremendous discernment at the end of it. But but God can speak to you this evening in in in just a a way. And and it's not consensus. You know, it's not what we all believe he said. There's things he says that we all agree on, but it becomes personal &gt;&gt; and when the still small voice speaks to you. So don't always start to listen when there's the thunder and the lightning and the wind, but always be listening to that still small voice. So this is the way back. Uh he's going to read the same scriptures we read this morning. I'm going to play the uh I'm going to play it from the beginning. um uh just uh you know he talks about tickets for the full gospel business and things that don't seem to be any ma matter but I I just like you to see the way that he approaches the people and then how he goes on to speak sometimes saying s such very straightforward things but yet you can feel the love that he has you know what I mean? He he really has the same spirit of Elijah. They have tore down my altars. They have killed my prophets. You know, they seek to kill me. And that's what the church was doing. It was leaving the real true word of God. And we had a voice that spoke out and called us back to that. This still is the the hour and the word of restoration. So, uh, we've read the word of God, so we will not stand when Brother Brandham reads the scripture, but I I I trust you'll enjoy just 45 minutes. It's 5:40, so that means we we should be done by 6:30 and we'll we'll let you go. So, God bless you and and and enjoy this message. Uh, thank you. You may be seated. again before Yay. I sing with the Yord. Marvelous to see the simplicity of the working of the spirit and people who are uh just humble enough to listen and believe it and just keep it how we think that exhortation from God that we should be waiting and he'll do a work among us. We thank him. Now, uh, it was a little long last night. I just got in and few minutes ago and and I was sorry to keep you standing like that and, um, try to hurry up tonight if I possibly can. And tomorrow morning, the businessman's breakfast at the Washington. And um uh I was just told by a brother who has the tickets that the tickets must be purchased tonight on kind of having enough room to see when they get enough uh room sold out for in the morning so they can have the things ready. And he said be sure to get your tickets. I suppose they'll be at the front of the uh room up there uh tonight and tomorrow night if the Lord willing. I want to never know but just thinking if he's willing I'd like to speak on a special something tomorrow night that is on we have all things in Christ. I a little familiar text but today it just come to me and I just want to talk on it tomorrow night the Lord willing. Then I think we have a Sunday morning and then Sunday night the Lord willing I want to preach on the subject the countdown ready for the church to move out. See the countdown thing. You know what the countdown is. And um I believe we can prove it by the scriptures that we're right now in the countdown. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, so pray for us. And if you haven't got any church to go to Sunday morning, we'd be glad to have you here Sunday night. Of course, if you got your own church, that's your first post of duty. We expect you to attend that. But if you um don't, while we'd be glad to have you. And um I understand that tonight if we can get through quick enough, we're going to have a a little prayer line. Billy said he'd give out some prayer cards here. I think that was right. Yeah. That we're going to have a prayer line to pray for the sick. And sometimes I somebody has told me lots of times said, "You ought to stay with that praying for the sick. You ought to try to do this other." Somebody's called me not long ago and said, "What are you always picking on them women for?" Well, I'm not picking on them. He said, "Well," I said, "Won't you leave them women alone?" said all them men about their organization and everything. Very prominent brother. And I said, "You don't believe it that scriptural for him to do that, do you?" He said, "No, but said," didn't the Lord call you to pray for sick? I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Well, won't you stay with that?' I said, 'I do.' And he said, let if he called you to pray for sick, let let the preachers take care of that. I said, but they're not doing it. He said, he said, "Well, I said I I got to." He said, "Well, most of the people in I know I guess million people consider you to be a prophet." I said, "I'm not no prophet." He said, "But the people think of you that way." He said, "Frankly, I do myself." I said, "Thank you." I said, "Sometimes he shows me things that's coming and never lied to me yet, and he won't because he's God. He can't. And um and he said, "Well, uh if you be God's servant like that, why don't you teach them women and things how to receive high spiritual gifts instead of keep fussing at him about cutting their hair and wearing shorts and makeup and things?" Said, "You ought to teach them greater things and how they can receive great gifts and do something." I said, "How you going to teach algebra when they won't even listen to their ABCs?" learn that and then we'll start on something else. And sounds rather sacriiggious. An old minister, thank you. An old minister one time went to hold a a meeting at a place and he said preached the first night on repentance, the second night on repentance, the third night, fourth night, fifth night. The deacons met him back there and said, "Brother, we enjoy that message on repentance." But said, "Have you got something else you can preach on?" He said, "Oh yes. I'll wait till they all repent first and then start on something else. So I walk into the house of God and see every thing lined up looking fine. Then we start something else. So So you're you I do desire your prayer and I don't say those things to be bad. You know that I'm zealous. It's God's daughters. It's God's sons. And we ought to behave like that. We ought to act like it. and try to come up with it. I'm way short. Ask your prayers for me and I'm praying for you. So, we'll pray together for each other and maybe someday God will bring us all together and a great something. He'll take us up out of all this chaos here. Anyhow, I'm kind of getting tired of this old pest house. Anyhow, aren't you? I like to take a solo flight one of these mornings when he comes. Now, I gave out last night that after talking about the Jubilee and calling to return back to the original Pentecost and to the message, I said tonight I would try to speak a little bit on how to get back. You know, there's no need to tell anybody what to do unless you tell them how to do it. That's the uh thing. Now, there's the text that I want to read. I've I've used it before, but maybe not exactly in this way, but I thought it fit in good and I just have to bring it that way. So, I'm think that uh bringing this on how to get back and there's many ways out, but there's only one way back. I was a fellow said one time in in the mountains, he was we was up there, another fellow and I who were licensed guides in Colorado, he had a group of people on the other side, a little dude outfit and they brought some fellas in there and the guide himself got lost and he was wandering around back there. He drove up where we was at on a horse. He said, "Hey." This fellow was with me, Mr. Jeff, kind of a quick spoken man. He said, "Hey." said, "How you get out of here?" He said, "How'd you get in here?" He said, "That way." Well, then that's the way out. So, the way back again. So, that's it. It's just it. Let us read now in the book of 2 Kings and the first chapter of Second Kings, two or three verses. And we want to take a a subject and use for a text the way back. Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. And Ahaz fell down through the lattice in the upper chamber that was in Samara and was sick. And he sent messengers and said unto them, "Go and inquire of Beelzebub, the God of Acre, whether I shall recover of this disease." But the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, and go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there's not a God in Israel that you go to inquire of Beelub, the God of Acre?" And then I heard brother Moore a few moments ago on the uh intercom there uh speak and he didn't know what I was going to read this for a text on talking about a bomb and I want to read that in Jeremiah 8:22. Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? a question why why isn't the health of my people recovered now I would like to say that we are most happy to be enjoying this great time of fellowship and I hope that the Lord will not let one person come in here without being saved and one without the Holy Ghost but one will be filled with the Holy Ghost and every sick person be healed. I'm just looking forward to that and we're believing it. Now, our story starts off tonight with a people that had like last night had got away from God. And that's the most miserable thing that I could think of is someone a believer away from God. And we find out here that this king of Samaria hasn't the reason he was away from God because he had the wrong kind of tutoring, the wrong kind of raising. His mother was a heathen and his father was a backsliden Israelite, Ahab. And through there, he hadn't had very much bringing up in the way of the Lord, though by the people. And God has never left himself without a witness. &gt;&gt; And God had a witness in that day. But his father hated this witness. And his name was Elijah the prophet. And his mother hated this witness. But yet it was God's witness stood just the same. God's always got a people somewhere that he can point to and say, "That's it. Oh, I want to be among that number. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we all want to be there. It's the desire of every heart. We want to be among that number that God can say, "This is my people." Look at them. They're an example of what I am. They are reflecting my life and theirs. They have surrendered their life and I'm reflecting mine life through theirs. What a beautiful thing. What a how it must make God feel good to know that he's got somebody he can put trust in. And he had a man and his name was Elijah. And now this man God had blessed. Not always material blessings mean that you're you're right with God because he caused the wicked to prosper. But this man had had succeeded his father his father's death and Ahaza had preceded him and he was going right in the same way his father was going and his mother doing wrong before God and he fell to the lattice in his house and was sick perhaps maybe it mashed him up inside inwardly bleeding or or some disease set in maybe an infection from his fall might have broke his ribs or punctured his lungs or something that he was uh very sick and he wondered about whether he was going to live or not. And so instead of going to him, what he should do, he sent some messengers, perhaps a palace guard that he had confidence in, sent him over to Acorn, to the god Beelub, uh, devil, a fortune teller, over there to inquire whether he was going to live or not. Now, what a rude thing that would be for a man who was king over a supposed to be spiritual people. A people who believed in God and yet their own leader consulting something else besides the thing that he ought to consult him. &gt;&gt; He ought to know the he knowed the laws. They were priests in the land. There were churches and so forth. And there was a prophet who had the word of the Lord. And instead of doing that, he wanted to take the most popular route. I think that's what's the matter today. We want that that most popular route. And when God makes a way, the people gets away from him and God makes a way for that people to return back to him like I was speaking of last night. And the people refuse to do it. Then God asked why. He always asked that. Why didn't you do it? So if he makes a way and we refuse to do it, then then he asks why we didn't do it. And I would rather get it fixed up here than to wait for him to ask me judgment why I didn't do it. Uh some man's sins go before them. Others follow. I want mine to go on before me. Confess and then I I want to be right when that time comes. As the old colored brother said, you know, a long time ago said, I talked to the Lord and I told him I wanted my way clear. I didn't want no trouble when I come down to the river. So, I think that's about the way we all feel. That kind of expresses it that we don't want no trouble at the river because it's going to be a awful push and shoving time at that time. So, we want to be sure that we're right. Now this king, there was a way provided for him to find out from the Lord, but he refused to do it. And then God took his provided way, which was his prophet. And maybe the king didn't even consider this uh whiskered, bald-headed fell uh that was not very well thought of amongst the people. His message was always condemning and biting and shoving and the people around because he couldn't do nothing else. He was a prophet. The word of the Lord comes to the prophet and the prophet has to stand on the word. And when the word's not obeyed, there's nothing to do but rebuke. That's all. So this fellow didn't mean to be bad. He just had to do it because he was not governed by his own thoughts. He was governed by the spirit of God. And that's the way we all should be governed by the spirit of God. And if we are, then we see sin, it makes us sick. There's something about it. It even grieved God's heart. One time he ever made a man because sin was so awful in the earth. Now, so he asked God had a way for him to know it, but he didn't take that way. He took the most popular way that there was among the people. And uh I hate to say this, but we're always seeing slogans, America back to God, back to God hour and things like that, but the thing of it is they want to come back the way that man has achieved for them to come back. They want to come back in their own way of thinking, their own way of doing. And usually it's contrary from God's way of returning. And then when they turned DOWN GOD'S PROVIDED way for them to return, then they God asked them why why did you do it that way? Now like we call a a time now the used to be the presidents would say we'll call a 15 minutes of prayer all the machinery stop. That'll never do it. IT'S GOT TO TAKE A BREAKING UP. &gt;&gt; It's got to take a dying out. &gt;&gt; It's got to take a regeneration. It don't take an hour of prayer. It takes until &gt;&gt; you come back. &gt;&gt; It's a bringing back coming back to the facts of faith and coming back to not even that it's not a something that you imagine or a declaration of creeds or or some through some instrumentality of man but it's through knowing Christ himself. Know him not even the word. He if you know him, you know the word because he is the word. &gt;&gt; Then you've got to come back to that reality. Uh God wants to manifest himself to his people and the church wants to manifest itself to the people. More numbers, bigger crowds, richer people, so forth like that. BETTER DRESSED. THAT'S WHAT'S GOT US IN THE CHAOS we're in. IT &gt;&gt; BE BETTER OFF IF WE ALL WORE SACKCLOTH. IT'D BE BETTER OFF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB, &gt;&gt; be going to one another's house and and see if we could get something to eat. I'd rather be see the church in that condition and yet spiritfilled than to see it WELL POLISHED AND DRESSED IN BIG things and then dying in the spirit. &gt;&gt; God makes a way and we refuse it. We don't return the way that he provides for us to return. And Hezekiah did the same thing. He was like many of us today. He was just too stubborn. HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO. YET, he knew ELIJAH WAS OUT THERE IN THE WILDERNESS. He knew THAT THERE WAS A GOD IN HEAVEN, BUT HE WANTED TO TAKE THE MOST POPULAR WAY, go over to where all the people through uh the prophetist they had had there, the Ahab's wife Jezebel, and she was a heathen. They wanted to go over to Acron and consult one of the idols if he would return because being a king if he would lower his self down uh get himself unpopular with the people. That's a trouble. That's a trouble the way our women do today. That's the reason that man YOU TALK ABOUT CHRISTIANITY SAY I BELONG to so and so that don't have nothing to do with it. I I may belong to a certain organization. That still don't mean you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; Christianity doesn't consist of joining something. Christianity consists of a a family. A birth into a family. &gt;&gt; You are a Christian by birth. But it's most popular say I'm Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal or something. I I'm that saying saying I'm born again of the spirit of God. the Holy Ghost has come upon me and I'm a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the that's the way. But the king wanted to be popular and that's the way the people take it today. And they might put revivals across the country and uh have slogans of a million more in so many years or uh increase their membership and their scholarship and what more and it'll NEVER NEVER YOU'RE GOING FARTHER AWAY ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE WAY BACK. GOD HAS A WAY BACK. I want to speak to you about that way back. And uh you must come back the WAY THAT GOD PROVIDED FOR YOU TO come back. Now, let's talk on these this king just for a moment. The reason he didn't want to because he was stubborn. He just didn't he just wanted to be like the other people. um he uh had his own ways and he wanted to be that way and he wanted to be come back the popular way and um he didn't want to take the way that God provided for him. So he just ignored that prophet and what the prophet would say because oh no doubt the prophet would sharply tell him repent. &gt;&gt; GET RIGHT WITH GOD. YOU'RE NOT FIT TO BE A KING. And oh how that would droop his feathers down before the people. See as a king. Oh my. He couldn't stand that. So maybe the devil over there and and the idol would say oh great king Dr. So and so you're Jesse. he could be popular amongst the people and have a great famous name. Oh, how people love the praises of things. And so he thought if he could get that, why he'd be stuck up before the people. He'd be a polished man before the people. And I hope you're reading between the lines while I'm meaning. So then he thought he'd be a great person, BUT HE WOULDN'T COME down to that man who had telling the truth. &gt;&gt; And he really thought he's putting something over on him. So he sent the servants. He said, "Go over and inquire of the god of acronyub if I'm going to get well of this disease or not." And the LORD GOD KNOWS THE HEART OF EVERY MAN. &gt;&gt; He knows the intention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You can't hide nothing from God." &gt;&gt; No, sir. HE SAID, "GO UP there in the road and meet him." AND ASKED HIM, "WHY DOES HE DO A THING LIKE THAT? IS IT BECAUSE there is not a God in Israel? Is it because he don't have a prophet? Is it BECAUSE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T EXIST? THEN WHY WOULD HE GO OVER DO A THING LIKE THAT YET BEING AN ISRAELITE? &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHY THAT MEN AND WOMEN TRY TO DENOMINATE PEOPLE INTO A FELLOWSHIP OF OF DENOMINATION INSTEAD OF BRINGING THEM BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S THE MOST POPULAR WAY. &gt;&gt; I belong to so and so. I'm Dr. So and so from certain certain organization. I'm for Purdue. I I have a scholarship of so and so. I got my PhD, my LLD. That don't mean nothing to God. &gt;&gt; Not a thing. &gt;&gt; Elijah might not had a LLD or PhD. Frankly, we don't know nothing about him. He just come on the scene and went off the scene the same way. We don't know who his pap and mama was. Don't know nothing ABOUT HIM. BUT GOD KNEW ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; He found a man that he could use. AND &gt;&gt; HE FOUND A MAN THAT WASN'T AFRAID. NO MATTER THE WHOLE NATION AGAINST HIM, HE STILL CALLED BLACK, BLACK AND WHITE. WHITE. &gt;&gt; God sent us another. That's right. Send us somebody that's not afraid. Somebody that don't uh re have to have the honor and praises of man. SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS ONLY TO GOD and believes God and speaks the truth. &gt;&gt; That person will do that. GOD WILL VINDICATE THAT TRUTH TO be truth. &gt;&gt; Tell me what man could close the heavens in the days of his prayer. Could Acre and the God of Acre do it? Could the God of Achre do the things that Elijah did? Certainly not. Show that there was a living God with Elijah. But this man was so stuck up and popped up to he didn't want to lower himself to such a thing. BUT ELIJAH GIRDED HIMSELF UP, WENT UP THERE AND stood in the road. This old woolly looking fell standing out there. He didn't have on a clergy coat and so forth, but he he had a woolly face and maybe his bald head sunburned and his hair sticking out. You'd probably run him away if he was begging and come up there and stood in the road like that. The Bible said he was hairy all over and he had a piece of leather girded around him. That wasn't very much of a clergy suit, but he couldn't show any credentials or what fellowship he come from. But brother, he had it beneath his heart. HE WAS IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD CUZ HE HAD thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the way back. &gt;&gt; He had thus sayeth the Lord. Wasn't much to look at but earn that little old skinny body be a heart that God lived in. Amen. &gt;&gt; He stood up there in the road with his hands folded, watched them come up, stood right in their way, and when they got up, uh, he probably crossed the path, stood there. He said, "RETURN AND GO BACK." AND ASKED HIM, "WHY DO YOU DO A THING LIKE IT IS because there's no God in Israel? Doesn't he have a prophet to consult these things? Because he's done this." TELL HIM, "THUS SAYAITH THE LORD, HE'S NOT coming off of that bed." Oh my. God will work his way despite anything anybody else can do about it. God's going to do it. He's going to do it in his own way. &gt;&gt; We ain't going to stop it at all. We're not going to even hinder it. That's all. He's going to do it anyhow. He's going to have a church. I don't care who says he won't and how many unbelievers rise up. God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle. He's going to be there. &gt;&gt; He done said he was. &gt;&gt; I just strive to be part of it. That's all. Amen. &gt;&gt; He might send preachers across the country preaching. Everybody might turn them down, throw them in jail, kick them out of town. He'll have the church just the same. &gt;&gt; As old John said, God's able of these stones to rise children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; God's still God. &gt;&gt; He can do he Paul where the the church in their decision had made a Aaron choose metheus. But that Paul a little old hooknose hottempered Jew. He said, "I'm going to show you what I'm going to do with him." He made him one of the greatest apostles of all of them because it was a work of God did something. &gt;&gt; Now we find this prophet speaking in the name of the Lord and sending him back. And the king said, "WHAT KIND OF A MAN STOPS YOU?" BUT he was a funny looking fellow. Said he was hairy all over and he had a piece of of leather about his loins. He said that was Elijah the Tishbite. He know his number was up. &gt;&gt; He knowed something was wrong. When that Elijah come back and said, "Tell him, thus sayeth the Lord, he's not coming off of that van." Oh my. That settled it. People today question. It's just like a a patient LAYING ON A DOCTOR'S STEP when the doctor has medicine for the patient's disease and the patient refuses to take that medicine for his inoculation and he MAY BE SO CLOSE TO THE REMEDY UNTIL HE IS SET RIGHT ON THE DOCTOR'S DOORSTEP AND DIE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. is because he refuses the remedy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing in church. &gt;&gt; NOW THEY SIT RIGHT IN THE PEW AND DIE SINNERS, DIE UNBELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE'S NO REMEDY. THERE'S A BOMB in Gilead. &gt;&gt; BUT UH IT'S THE PEOPLE'S OWN STUBBORN WILL. There's plenty of Holy Spirit, but it's THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT IT. &gt;&gt; Jesus said THE SICK NEEDS A DOCTOR. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IF THE DOCTOR COMES AND THE SICK WON'T ACCEPT THE DOCTOR? &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT GOOD CAN THE DOCTOR DO? WE NEED A DOCTOR &gt;&gt; AND A PATIENT NEEDS TO TAKE HIS MEDICINE &gt;&gt; CUZ THIS IS a sick world and a sick church at a sick time, &gt;&gt; right? So if the patient dies sitting on the DOCTOR'S STEPS NOW, YOU CAN'T BLAME THE DOCTOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF HE PROVES HE'S GOT THE MEDICINE IN THERE FOR THE REMEDY, &gt;&gt; got the medicine in there for his for his for the remedy for his cure. AND THE PATIENT SITS on the steps and I ain't going in there. While inside is THE REMEDY, WELL, YOU'VE GOT CERTAIN DISEASE. WHY? HE'S GOT A MEDICINE CABINET FULL IN THERE THAT'LL KILL THAT DISEASE. IT'S A POISON DRUG THAT'LL KNOCK THAT DISEASE OUT. HERE'S OTHERS. THEY GOT HEALED. Look at them. They had that disease and they've got it NO MORE. AND THE DOCTOR'S GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINE. AND YOU SIT ON THE STEP AND SAY, "WELL, I COME THIS FAR. If he wants me to get healed, he'll come out here and do it." Oh, no. No, no, that's not it. NO. YOU'LL DIE ON THE steps and it won't be the doctor's fault. Neither will it be the lack of medicine. Is because of the own stubborn will of the people that wouldn't take the medicine. And the church is the same. WE'VE GOT PLENTY of scripture. WE GOT THE THING THAT'LL STRAIGHTEN THE CHURCH OUT. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE THING THAT'LL SEND YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU WAS 50 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO TAKE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO GET WELL. A CURE of these diseases, THESE SPIRITUAL DISEASES MUST have it. Now, it's a dangerous thing. we had in our country just now that salt vaccine. Uh they asked everybody to take it all young and old to inoculate from this horrible polio and everybody thousands went in to take it. And uh how did they how did they do that? You see, you find out in taking doctor's medicine, you know, IT'LL WORK ON SOME people and then it won't work on the others because that, you know, everybody ain't made alike. Now, we have this penicellin. I carry a card in my pocket. So that if I'd ever have an accident, a doctor must never give me penicellin. It would kill me. So, it'll kill some people and help others because the serum doesn't work just right on all the people. Do you ever think the way they find a serum, the way they do it, they read books and chemists go and take certain germs and they mix them together and different poisons till they get a formula, something that won't kill the patient BUT WILL KILL THE germ and that's the way they work. Then they get all this together and then they go GET HIM A GUINEA pig and they get a long needle and s this in the guinea pig and squirt him full of it. And then if THE GUINEA PIG SURVIVES IT, then they squirt it in you and see if you survive it. Well, uh, that's all right. They've done great things, see, IN DOING THAT. BUT THAT'S THE WAY THEY FIND OUT HOW TO work on the people. Now, you find out that everybody isn't made just like a guinea pig. So, it it doesn't work on everybody. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING. God's inoculation works on everybody. &gt;&gt; It'll work on everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll it'll help everybody that takes it. &gt;&gt; Uh God asked the question, is there no bomb in Gilead? Or is there no physician there? Then if there is, WHY IS THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE not recovering? The sickness, the infirmity of my daughter. That would be the church, the daughter of my people, which the Orthodox church is speaking directly to us. The daughter of my people has not recovered from her sickness. Is it because we have no physician or we have no no uh he has no medicine to work with, no bomb, no physician? Now we are told by medical science today which we highly salute for these things that if uh we have these different infirmities and fail to take these inoculations, it's a dangerous thing. You might lose your life if you don't take it. We're living in a day of of sin and sickness. WE GOT MORE SICKNESS THAN WE EVER HAD, but it causes more sin and and things than we ever had. That's where sickness come from. Sickness is a result of sin. Before we had any sickness, we had no sin. And sin followed sickness. See, I mean, u sickness followed sins. Pardon me. Um had sin first and the results of of sin brought sickness. &gt;&gt; Now, and therefore, now as sin increases, sickness increases. And we've got the best doctors we ever had. We got better drugs than we ever had. &gt;&gt; WE GOT MORE HOSPITALS than we ever had. We got better trained man than we ever had. AND WE GOT MORE SICKNESS THAN WE EVER HAD. &gt;&gt; WHY? WE GOT MORE SIN THAN WE EVER HAD. &gt;&gt; We got more people. And when people begin to multiply, THEN SIN AND VIOLENCE SETS IN &gt;&gt; THESE BIG CITIES. Not like living out in the country, the walled in cities that we talked about last night. You take these walled in cities, you're always getting sin. And when we get these other kind of spiritual walled in cities, you're always mixing everything with it. Sin, too. &gt;&gt; Now, we find out the doctors tell us that the number one killer is heart trouble. Well, I don't disagree with the doctor cuz I'm not a doctor. But I'll say one thing. Number one killer isn't heart trouble. NUMBER ONE KILLER is sin trouble. &gt;&gt; Sin is number one killer, &gt;&gt; not heart trouble. So many say today, you know, brother Brandham, you you say these things too hard. We have to sin a little every day. WE JUST GOT TO. SOMEONE SAYS, YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRHAM, I CONDEMNING SMOKING. And uh I do believe that man shouldn't smoke. I believe in holiness, CLEANNESS &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT SOUL, BODY, AND SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; And he said WE I JUST GOT TO SMOKE. I I just have to smoke a little. I JUST GOT TO DO IT. And we hear so many say that I GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE SOCIABLE DRINK IN ORDER TO HOLD MY JOB. WE HEAR WOMEN SAY I JUST GOT TO CUT MY HAIR AND WEAR MY DRESSES UP TO DATE TO keep my social standing in my church. If I don't, THE WOMEN SAY I LOOK TOO OLD. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, but I'm going TO SAY SOMETHING. THAT'S PENTECOSTAL PROSTITUTION. It's right. &gt;&gt; THE REASON THEY DO IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TRIED THE INOCULATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T TRIED GOD'S SERUM FOR SIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. I go tell you the way back. &gt;&gt; They want to come back. You must get inoculated. You must take God's bomb. God's serium. He's got it. IT'S A DOUBLE CURE for sin. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S OWN SON, WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT CLEANS YOU FROM SIN AND FILLS YOU FOR SERVICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the way we have to come back &gt;&gt; is through THOSE ELEMENTS THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS. You don't have to do it. And the VERY REASON YOU DO IT, some minister said to me not long ago, HE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT YOU SPEAK OF IS the truth." I really believe that. He said, "My church teaches the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but we believe we receive the Holy Ghost when we believed when moment we believe that Abraham believed God and he was counted unto him for imputed to him for righteousness." I said, "That's true." But then God gave him the seal of circumcision as A CONFIRMATION OF HIS FAITH. I SAID, "IF YOU'VE never received the Holy Ghost yet, God's never recognized your faith." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're the children of Abraham. He said, "If I did that, oh, Brother Brandham, if I did that, then I'd be put out of my church." I SAID, "WHAT?" I WAS. And he said, "Well," I said, "Well, uh, I can't do that." And I said, "Why can't you DO IT? JUST TELL ME WHY YOU CAN'T DO IT." HE SAID, "WELL, WELL, I COULDN'T GET ANY OTHER MEETINGS ANYWHERE." I said, "NONSENSE. IF GOD CALLS YOU TO THE GOSPEL, HE'S GOT A PLACE FOR YOU TO PREACH. YOU GOT SOMEBODY THAT'LL LISTEN TO YOU. CERTAINLY, THERE'LL BE SOMEBODY who will listen. Stand on the street corner, SAY, "YOU THROW ME IN JAIL, THEN PREACH TO THE JAILER." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody Paul did it that way. They all got saved. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You say you have to do it. No, you don't. The reason they do it is BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TESTED this inoculation. They haven't taken the toxine yet for it. There's something that'll cure that that'll cure that scare you got. There's something THAT'LL MAKE YOU DRESS AND ACT LIKE A LADY. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE YOU LIVE like a Christian. There's something that'll that'll make you be SO FULL OF GOD TILL YOU STAND TO GIVE a testimony that'll shake the shingles. Who's on top of THE HOUSE? IF YOU'LL JUST TAKE THE INOCULATION, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT to take the toxin. &gt;&gt; You got the disease. SO, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO IS TAKE THE TOXIN TO GET RID OF IT. THAT'S THE WAY TO RETURN BACK TO NORMAL CHRISTIAN HEALTH. The church is sick. It's puny. It's anemia. It's got malignancy. AND THERE'S NO EARTHLY CURE FOR IT. EDUCATION WON'T DO IT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE TRIED IT. &gt;&gt; DENOMINATION WON'T DO IT. WE'VE TRIED IT. &gt;&gt; YOU ONLY MAKE IT WORSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY BACK AND THAT'S THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; INOCULATION. Come back to Christ. Come back to the HOLY SPIRIT. COME BACK TO LIFE ETERNAL AGAIN. That's the way we get back. The people say, "I have to do this to keep my standard with the people." You don't have to do it. It shows a shallowess. It shows a cowardliness. &gt;&gt; And a PREACHER THAT'LL STAY IN THE PULPIT AND COMPROMISE ON the principles of CHRIST BECAUSE SOME BUNCH OF BISHOPS DOMINATE HIM AND TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO DO THIS or we punch you out of the fellowship. YOU'RE A COWARD. STAND THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TELL THE TRUTH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; No matter what the price is. Look at Stevens that morning. Our little Holy Ghost brother standing before the Sanhedrin council council the seventh chapter of Acts. He said, "Ye man of Israel, you that dwell in Judea and so forth, how our fathers come up out of Macaponia and so forth, begin to tell him that he got wound up, got started, the Holy Ghost come up on him." He said he shined, his face shine like an angel. HE SAID, "YOU STIFF NECKS, &gt;&gt; UNCIRCUMCISED OF HEART AND EARS, YOU ALWAYS DO RESIST THE HOLY GHOST. LIKE YOUR FATHERS DID, so do you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knowed where he was standing. He know his position. His face not might have shined like a light up there, but an ANGEL KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. &gt;&gt; And an angel IS A MESSENGER THAT'S COMMISSIONED from God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE DOWN. HE KNOWS EXACTLY THEM HALF A MILLION HOWLING WOLVES OF CLERGY OUT THERE CONDEMNING THAT MAN FOR THE WAY HE WAS DOING AND THE SERMONS HE WAS PREACHING. AND STEPHEN STOOD THERE AND SAID, "YOU'RE UNCIRCUMCISED OF THE HEART and ears &gt;&gt; and you RESIST THE HOLY GHOST LIKE YOUR fathers did. &gt;&gt; So are you doing the same thing?" He was telling them the way back &gt;&gt; to the God that opened up the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Tell them to the God who rained the plagues down in Egypt. But they didn't want to take the way back. So they stoned the messenger. You don't get rid of it that way. It still hangs on. The one that witnessed become one of them pretty soon. Paul, right? Yes. They haven't tried the toxin. You know the reason they do it? They're afraid of that new birth. I mean the real new birth. Oh, everybody say, "Sure, I believe you must be born again." Yes, sir. Yes. But when it comes to the real birth, they believe the new birth by shaking hands, saying a bunch of creeds or something. They call that the new birth. That ain't the new birth. Uh they're afraid of the new birth. Listen, any birth is a mess. I don't care where it's in a pig pin or where it's at. It's a mess. Any birth and stores is a new birth. &gt;&gt; It'll make you do THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T think you'd ever do. &gt;&gt; BUT IT BRINGS LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE LIFE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE DEATH. PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; BEFORE A SEED CAN REPRODUCE ITSELF, IT'S GOT TO DIE. &gt;&gt; IN ORDER AND NOT ONLY DIE, BUT IT'S GOT TO ROT. &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO GET NEW LIFE OUT OF IT, IT'S GOT TO DIE AND ROT IN ITSELF. &gt;&gt; AND SO DOES EVERY SINNER. Every man, NO MATTER HOW HIGH HE'S EDUCATED AND HOW MUCH HE'S POLISHED, HOW MANY uh degrees he has in a church OR SO FORTH, HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS, HOW MANY COLLEGES HE'S EDUCATED OUT OF, HE'S GOT TO DIE TO HIS OWN THEORY, HE'S GOT TO DIE TO HIMSELF. HE'S GOT TO DIE TO EVERYTHING TO BE REBORN AGAIN BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; You make him cry and boohoo and speak in tongues and jump up and down and carry on like a maniac. But he's got new life. &gt;&gt; That's what it takes to do it. He's got to have new life. They're afraid of the new birth. The new birth is a mess. Now, they call new birth. Oh, here they Oh, sure. I believe in being born again. And they say they're born again and deny the word. Say they have the Holy Ghost and take the scriptures and plainly TEACH THE BIBLE HOW IT IS. AND THEN THEY SAY, "OH, THAT WAS for another age." And mean that the Holy Ghost that's in you will witness that is for another age. what he said is to you and to your children to them as far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't lie. &gt;&gt; If there's a spirit in YOU THAT DENIES THAT to be the truth, THEN IT'S NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT WROTE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's as solid as I know how to place it. &gt;&gt; It takes death to produce life. You got to die to your own thinking. YOU GOT TO DIE TO YOUR OWN THEOLOGIES. YOU GOT TO DIE TO YOUR OWN SELF, TO your own human ways. You've got to be regenerated, a new creature, a new creation. BEFORE YOU CAN BE THAT, YOU CAN'T be two at THE SAME TIME. YOU GOT TO DIE TO ONE IN ORDER TO BE BORN IN THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; It brings a mess. And it causes a mess, too. But you're you got new life. What difference does it make? You got to do it. You know, there was a time when we couldn't even inoculate people for typhford fever. I'm looking at a friend of mine, a nurse sitting here watching me while I'm speaking this. But that's right. And sister, now there's a time when they didn't have inoculation for taport fever. Thousands died with it. There was a time when they didn't have inoculation for polio. Thousands and thousands of little children died. But now there's no excuse. We have inoculation. That's right. All right. Now, there was a time when this toxine or bomb, which we'll call toxine of God, there it wasn't too perfect because it was called it was by the blood of goats and sheep and cattle and so forth. It didn't exactly take away sin. It just covered sin. A man had to go year by year and make his confession and so forth. There was a time when it was right. But now the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin. &gt;&gt; And what is sin? Unbelief. Unbelief in what? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly. If you say you believe God and deny his word, well, you don't believe him. If you say, "I believe," Brother Brandham, say, "But he's wrong. He's Well, how can you do that?" You couldn't do it. I know you WAS WRONG BECAUSE YOU didn't believe me. &gt;&gt; And if you SAY YOU BELIEVE GOD AND DENY HIS WORD, WELL, THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE GOD BECAUSE GOD IS HIS WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You just can't do it. You've got to accept the word. THAT'S THE WAY BACK &gt;&gt; back by the word path and the word is God. Now, we find that and we see that one time that that inoculation wasn't too good. There was a conscience always of sin and he had to come year by year and make his offering. But now in Hebrews, it tells us that if the worshipper is once purged, he has no more conscience of sin or otherwise no more desire to sin. The whole thing's gone from him. There's no more. You don't have to sin every day. You don't have to do these things. You do IT BECAUSE YOU WILLFULLY WANT TO. And the reason you willfully want to IS BECAUSE YOU NEVER DIED TO YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. I know that's scorching, but it's good. &gt;&gt; When you die to yourself, then you become a new creature. &gt;&gt; Then those things are gone. And if you try TO ACT LIKE YOU got him before you have, it's like a I said the other day, like a blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings. &gt;&gt; Say, you see, I'm a I'm a peacock. He isn't. That's something YOU STUCK IN YOURSELF. It has to grow from the inside out. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THE HOLY SPIRIT IS. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU smear on or something like that. IT'S A NEW BIRTH. YOU GOT TO BE BORN AGAIN. AND THESE VIRTUES OF THE HOLY GHOST HAS TO COME FROM THE inside out. And when world and sin and cutting hair and painting comes out against the word of God, it shows the Holy Spirit's not there. &gt;&gt; That's a direct evidence. &gt;&gt; So what would you call it? Pentecostal prostitution. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Committing spiritual fornication with the God of heaven. What a shame of disgrace it is. Oh, that's horrible. Yes, sir. Now we find out that when man tries to find a serum, a doctor to give to his patient to inoculate him from &gt;&gt; lesson on what the Holy Ghost is, &gt;&gt; what the new birth is, what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is, &gt;&gt; what it is to fake it. &gt;&gt; I mean, this voice was created and designed by God for you. &gt;&gt; He gave you an ear to hear it. &gt;&gt; He gave you a heart to receive it. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean it it it cuts you just the way it cuts somebody else. But could you hear when he came down he said what the this is what the evidence of it really is and and you've got to want to have it &gt;&gt; but he said the problem is people are afraid. &gt;&gt; You know you don't have to be afraid of God taking over your life. &gt;&gt; He promised you'd never beg bread. He promised he'd always be there for you. He promised he wouldn't forsake you. &gt;&gt; He promised if you'd stand for him, he'd stand for you. &gt;&gt; He promised if you're ashamed of him here, he'll be ashamed of you there. &gt;&gt; And it it's just what it is. And that's what we've got to get back to. And so education don't do it. &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't do it. &gt;&gt; It takes God starting to work &gt;&gt; from the inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out. And if if uh you want to uh go back and and uh pick this up and and and listen to it uh and and finish it up. Uh I I would recommend that. &gt;&gt; But but you that's that voice on the inside that when he he says things, you know it's true. But that voice on the inside says, "That's where I've got to work. That's where I've got to do better. That I've got to separate myself from this. I I've got to pray more. I've got to read my Bible more. I' I've got to get more sincere. I've got to get rid of my fear. I've got to seek the face of the Lord, what he would have me to do." So, the voice is going out, and that applies to everything. &gt;&gt; But the inside voice is what applies to you. And that's the quickening of the spirit making that word alive. You can have the word, but the word killleth, &gt;&gt; but it's the spirit that brings life &gt;&gt; to it. And and I I I just thought I just felt that that it just really where we want to go, &gt;&gt; right? We want to go back &gt;&gt; to really being. We don't care about our popularity. We don't care about what anybody thinks. We just want to have that life of the Lord. And we want to apply the token to our lives. And and and if we have sin that so easily besets us, then we know that we got to confess that sin, get in the presence of the Lord, and let him purge us from it. &gt;&gt; There's no need condemning ourselves, &gt;&gt; right? You know, if you had polio, then you can't condemn yourself for polio. The only thing that condemns you if you don't take the medicine for polio. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That that's when the problem is. If you find yourself in a condition, you know, that's what he said. It's not it's not wrong to be sick sitting at the doctor's doorstep. He said that wasn't the sin. the sin was not to take the doctor's medicine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and and so that's the that's the process. And the the only the only place you're going to find the desire to do that is in your heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because in their heart, they didn't want it, &gt;&gt; right? They want to be associated but they don't want the effect of it. &gt;&gt; You know, so they provide another way. There's no other way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; You know, you you and and and God will do that. &gt;&gt; Don't even put an image in your mind &gt;&gt; of what being born again is. Don't even look at it like a like a one-time experience or or something that you go through. No, it's a life &gt;&gt; that comes into you. And as that life journeys, you'll find yourself you get the spirit of God. I'm just speaking from experience. I was a hippie. I had long hair, but you know, I got the Lord touched my life. I had drugs in my bedroom. I had drugs in my car. I had drugs to sell, you know, I had music. I had everything. It was all there. I didn't go b I wasn't born again. And then walked in and everything was gone. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I had to start purging. &gt;&gt; I had a a a fantastic mural painted on my wall because, you know, I like Bob Dylan. I had a fantastic mural painted on my wall. Very uh great painter in the realms of that I was in. And and when I when I wanted to take it down, I was going to paint that wall. They came and they took a skill saw and cut that painting out of my wall. Took it down and and put some sheetrock back up in in the place. I had to purge. That wasn't too smart then cuz Lesie had a complete set of Beatle albums still in their original cover and I don't know what do we do? Do we throw it in the dump? &gt;&gt; You know, of course, don't go look on eBay for that thing right now. You know what I mean? But you don't sell stuff back to the devil. You know what I mean? So you you destroy it. You don't give it back to the devil so he can use it ON SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU DESTROY THAT THING. &gt;&gt; And you got to purge. And the spirit is life. And how do you take the city? You take it one city at a time. You take it one battle at a time. One purging at a time. You know, I mean, and you just you deal with it. &gt;&gt; And every time you deal with it, it's a battle. Yes. &gt;&gt; And every time you deal with it, it's a struggle. And every time you deal with it, you have to overcome. &gt;&gt; That's why people throw things down and then they go back and pick it up. I mean, he said it right in there. &gt;&gt; They don't get rid OF IT BECAUSE THEY STILL WANT IT. &gt;&gt; But you got to have a revelation that what he has to offer is better. Yes, &gt;&gt; and you don't have to have both. &gt;&gt; He alone will do it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have the the world. That's Lady &gt;&gt; Oia. &gt;&gt; They want to have the world. They want to have their jobs. They want to have their things. They want to mix Christianity with it. How can I still be in the world and be a Christian? There's 900 different denominations that give you a way to do that. &gt;&gt; 900 different ways, &gt;&gt; thousands of voices, &gt;&gt; but this voice, &gt;&gt; the one voice, &gt;&gt; the one that knew, &gt;&gt; the one that God sent &gt;&gt; to bring us back. preaches it exactly &gt;&gt; what it takes. &gt;&gt; Now, I thank God that he has a church &gt;&gt; and a people &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; that's predestinated to that birth. &gt;&gt; It's their inheritance. &gt;&gt; What is an inheritance? It's something that that God leaves you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I wasn't going to bring this story up because Matthew shared it with me and I I I thought maybe he'd have it in one of his sermons one time, but then I realized that preachers always rob one another's sermons. You know what I mean? But Matthew, they did a job. He had a guy that worked for him and and when they were doing that job, he found $500,000 in the house that or the tree that they were working on. So he gave it to his boss and he told the owners of the house, "I find $5,000 $500,000 in your house and I gave it to the boss." Well, the boss kept it. &gt;&gt; So, the owners of the house sued the buyer for the 500,000. But then the family, the original family, they came and sued. &gt;&gt; So, you had three people &gt;&gt; in the lawsuit. You had the the contractor and his claim was finders keepers, &gt;&gt; right? You had the owners, you know what I mean? And their claim was, well, the guy said, I I bought it as is. And their their claim was, well, it wasn't part of the sale. BUT THEN THE ORIGINAL FAMILY CAME BACK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And they said it was it was our inheritance. &gt;&gt; And when the court ruled on it, who do you think they gave it to? &gt;&gt; The finder's keeper? &gt;&gt; No. You think they gave it to the one that bought the house with it in it? &gt;&gt; No. They gave it to its original inheritance because they said it was a mislaid inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me know when you preach on that. I want to hear it. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THEIR INHERITANCE ALL THE TIME THOUGH WAS MISPLACED. &gt;&gt; And that's what we GOT TO UNDERSTAND. SOMETIMES OUR INHERITANCE GETS MISPLACED, BUT IT'S STILL ours &gt;&gt; and we're predestinated to it. &gt;&gt; We can have it. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE MADE NOT TO BE AFRAID. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY STEPHEN, HE WASN'T AFRAID. AND FINALLY, WHEN that anointing got on him, HE SAID, "YOU STICK NECK UNCIRCUMCISED OF HEART AND EAR. YOU DO REJECT AND KILL THE PROPHETS LIKE YOU DID BEFORE. &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid of it. &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid that it's imitated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid that it's misused. &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid that it's made mockery of. You can't be afraid of of of other things that go on. You've got to listen to your still small voice &gt;&gt; if you want it. That's because there's a deep &gt;&gt; calling for a deep &gt;&gt; and God's got a promise &gt;&gt; that you can lay hold of. &gt;&gt; And God will manifest that promise in your life. And that's why Peter could stand there on the day of Pentecost and says, "Men and brethren, these are not drunk as you suppose, but this is what was promised &gt;&gt; by the prophet. &gt;&gt; I'll pour out my spirit." And that's what we need to be the evidence of good strong Christian life. Daylight, whether you shout, it's not in the fire. It's not in the storm. It's in that still small voice that speaks to you in your heart. It's the spirit of God living in you and producing a life. It's &gt;&gt; not in signs and wonders. Signs and wonders follow. &gt;&gt; It's a result of having the life. &gt;&gt; But he said if you don't have the life, all you become is a what did he say? A crow with peacock feathers. &gt;&gt; You're trying to be something that you're not. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you. Have you ever seen somebody try to imitate Brother Bram's ministry? It's miserable. I mean, I've seen him. Oh. There's some out someone out there right now that hurts in their back. &gt;&gt; Got back trouble. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's somebody. Oh, I I feel it right over here. Right over here. There's someone that's having financial trouble. Oh, I feel it. There's someone over here just have some upset stomachs. AND SOMEONE'S JUST THERE. OH, THAT'S ME. &gt;&gt; WELL, you might as well re read Dear Abby or your horoscope. I like the one that turned us back to the audience. There's a vision right there. I see you. Not today. Not right now. I SEE YOU 25 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; I SEE A DOG CHASING YOU DOWN THE alley and you getting in there and that's where you PICKED UP THAT SPIRIT. THUS SAYAETH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. That's somebody that really had it. &gt;&gt; And you can check them all out. Nobody ever spoke like this man spoke. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you were called and elected &gt;&gt; and chosen &gt;&gt; to hear that voice &gt;&gt; and let that voice bring you back &gt;&gt; to where you come from. &gt;&gt; And I hope you caught that gist through that tape that there's Elijah, there's a voice, and the church wasn't taking it. They got too proud, too stucked up &gt;&gt; for brother Brandham. They wanted to be more modern &gt;&gt; and more popular. &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest. There's people in today that want to leave out the ABCs in order and make the message more palatable. &gt;&gt; Hoping that more people would come and then they would hear about brother Brandham. Now, could you imagine somebody introducing me to Brother Bam and never tell me about this and never telling me about that and then me getting the book and go back and realize that you're not preaching the word of God. The very thing they're trying to bring them to is the very thing that's going to condemn them. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about somebody. You can go up to somebody that's got bobbed hair and and shorts on and everything and you tell them the truth. If that seeds in there, they're going to blush. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; One of the greatest experiences that I ever had in my life was in Mexico preaching in a church. And I remember a woman, she drove up into that meeting in a Mercedes Benz and I guess as the world would call it, I think they call them knockouts or something. Very beautiful Hispanic lady, you know, well made up, well jewelry and everything. And I heard the whispers, you know, she was an ill-famed woman and that's where she got her money. And they would go out and live in the world like that and then bring the money back to their families. She come in to church and we were preaching about like a passport and what you could carry and what things were you weren't allowed to bring into the country. You know how they have a list that you have to do you have any of this? And we brought that through the gospel. YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS, you can't take that, you can't take that. And I'll never forget it. She come down from that back row carrying her high heels in her hand, &gt;&gt; HER HAIR DOWN, TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER FACE, taking off her jewelry AS SHE WALKED DOWN TO THE ALTAR TO COME DOWN AND GET THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; You never know who this gospel will touch. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of this message. Don't be ashamed of this voice. There's an elected people out there to hear it. &gt;&gt; Play it for them. &gt;&gt; Give it to THEM TO READ. TELL THEM ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; It's their salvation. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, that's still small voice will rise up inside of them &gt;&gt; and bear witness &gt;&gt; to the truth. &gt;&gt; He can find you. Don't be deceived. Don't let it get away. Don't let the world take you away from this. The wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus who is the word. &gt;&gt; So the word will do it &gt;&gt; every time. &gt;&gt; Let's stay with the word of God. Let's be proud. &gt;&gt; And I mean with a humility proud. I don't mean arrogant, but let's be thankful. the thankful pride &gt;&gt; of this message &gt;&gt; and what God's done for it and and the courage of the prophet of God to stand there in the face of all things and speak this truth that we might live. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I hope you enjoyed the tape. I hope the service &gt;&gt; and the direction today will stir your hearts &gt;&gt; and that you in yourself &gt;&gt; within yourself, your own still small voice will say, "I need to return back &gt;&gt; to that voice &gt;&gt; and to that leadership &gt;&gt; and to that and that token applying in my life. I need to get my attitude right, my thinking right, my nature right, my spirit right. I need to work on myself. &gt;&gt; Not going to condemn anybody else. I'm going to remove the beam from my own eye. I'm going to get things right in my life. I'm called to get things right. It's my inheritance to get things right. It's my It's my calling to to have this spirit and have God manifest that spirit in the nature and the lifestyle and the frame and the person that he made me to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. We're not clones. &gt;&gt; We're children. &gt;&gt; Each one of us individual &gt;&gt; shining a light where nobody else can shine it. Nobody can take your place. So let's take our responsibility to be everything that God made us to be. God bless you. Let's stand. I'll ask brother Billy come and lead us in a song. The musicians to come. Uh, I I like listening. I tell you, I listened to this tape by myself and it was so much better listening to it with you. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't because I could say he was talking about you and not me. But you know what? I felt I knew I wasn't alone. &gt;&gt; Poor Elijah. He thought he was the only one. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But yet there were still those &gt;&gt; that were holding out for the original, &gt;&gt; the real thing. &gt;&gt; And I I'm thankful there's been a lot of things to run after. I've been in this message a long time. You know, like you know, I come in in early 70 and I've seen a lot of substitutes and the only thing that's ever stood and remained the same is what God put in the storehouse. &gt;&gt; You have a place to eat. &gt;&gt; I may leave. The church may have a different pastor. The congregation might flip. But the storehouse is eternal. It's the eternal word of God and it will always be there for you to feed on and it'll always lead and guide you. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, we so enjoyed the word of God today. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Lord, and I I preached from this message this morning and just highlighted some of the things that were moved on me. And Father, we listened to it tonight and I'm sure that there was so much more there for the people to receive. There's enough food for us all. For every need, for every vitamin need, for every physical need, for every spiritual need. There's enough food there, Father, for every single person here. Father, it's a type of you taking one fish and one loaf and multiplying it until everybody was fed. Oh God, I just trust that we'll fall back in love with following you. We'll fall back in love with searching the scriptures and finding eternal life. We'll fall back in love to listening and and obeying every little thing. We'll fall back in love with the correction of the spirit moving on us. We'll fall back in love with the fellowship of you in your word. Lord, you know, I'd like to see more of our believers return on Sunday. Many places don't even come to church on Sunday evening. But Lord, I'd like to have a desire amongst our people, such a hunger for God's word that they wouldn't trade it for anything. So I just ask that you would just help us all of us in our own heart to rededicate ourselves and know what we have. Know that we have the pearl of great price. That we have the lost coin, Father. that we have the treasure in the field and that we'll sell all we have to have it. We ask that you'd grant that to us in Jesus precious and holy name we pray. Amen. What are you playing for? &gt;&gt; Made for more. Yeah, I like that song. Let's just sing that. I I like that verse. I wasn't made to tend a grave. The wages of sin is death. I wasn't meant to live my whole life to go six feet in the ground. &gt;&gt; Now, if you ever at my funeral and you see that old wrinkled man there, that ain't me. You're going to look at the person I hated more than anybody else in the world. So when you walk up and look in that cliff and you look down there and you say, "Man, David McGary hated that guy." Did you know David McGary hated you? &gt;&gt; He hated you so much he left. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He hated you so much he didn't want to live with you no more. &gt;&gt; I'm going to divorce this thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. And there's only one way of divorce we know of and that's death. &gt;&gt; You don't hang it on a tree. It goes back to where it come. &gt;&gt; It goes back to the earth and then I get my original back. &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's something in me calling for my original. There's something in me that wants my body. I hear my theophony calling. Oh my. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go on, but I want to leave a testimony. behind. I want to leave a way in the sand. Many times I think maybe that's just why God brought me into life when he did. I met all the people that knew brother Brandham. I talked to them all. I spent hours walked in the woods with brother Roy Borders. Sat down with Earl Martin, talked with Dave Bis. sat down with Billy Ball, Roy Robersonson, just named him one after the other and heard him tell me about him, how he was, his nature, his spirit. Alan Mciri, I sat down and talked to with him. He told me how it was when brother Brandham was there in this meeting and how they came to him in his house and told him that they were no longer going to go with him with brother Brandham. Yeah. I don't know if he was a trustee or something in the church. He was somebody that was a powerhouse in that church. And he looked at me and he said, you know, they they wanted me to to not listen to the prophet more. said. He looked at me and he looked straight in the eye. He said, "I couldn't do it." I was over at DW W. Grant's church where brother Brand preached in Dallas. He came up to me and he said, you know, he said, and I told him, he say, I walked in, he came up to me and he he said, uh, who are you? says, "Well, but grant I'm I'm David McGary. I have a little church in Fort Worth, just a few of us, but we believe, you know, that Brother Bram's a prophet, and I wanted to come see this place." He grabbed me by the little pals. He's a little guy, littleer me, and he looked me right straight in the eye. He said, "David, you see all these crutches we have in this forer?" He said, 99 and 9/10 of them came from Brother Brandham's meetings. And he said, "Whatever you do," he said, "you do not leave, Brother Brandham." He was the only true prophet I ever knew. And his son was preaching on the pulpit. You know, he died just a few days after that. I believe it was his going out testimony. Don't leave this church. Don't leave this message. Don't leave it just the way that he said it. Stay with it just the way he said it. Listen to it. Let's keep playing it in our church. Let's not be ashamed of it. We might be oldfashioned, but let us have the oldfashioned religion that comes with it. We weren't made for anything else. We were made for this word. &gt;&gt; We were made for the same anointing that fell on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Not a substitute, but the same life. Don't be afraid of it. Don't be ashamed of it. It's life and it's life eternal. Amen. I know that I was called to believe this. Help me sing it. I know who I am cuz I know who you are. The cross of salvation was only now I am chosen free and I have a future. It's worth to live. going to be a freedom in your cave. I was made to be taken in the grave.

Lord, the battle becomes harder, harder and harder. Lord, &gt;&gt; but you are the God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Nothing can prevail against you. &gt;&gt; Nothing can prevail against your church. &gt;&gt; We thank you for these moments.
