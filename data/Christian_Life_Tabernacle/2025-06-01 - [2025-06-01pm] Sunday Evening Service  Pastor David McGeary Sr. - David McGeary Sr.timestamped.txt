[10:43] day, one second with his face to face,

[10:57] arguments tried to, you know, in the
[11:00] last chapter right there, he said, "My
[11:04] here heard about
[11:06] you, but now my eyes can see you." That
[11:11] was the revelation.
[11:13] Face to face with God. He give you the

[25:23] [Music]
[25:35] Satan tries to buff my soul.
[25:40] He says, "You have no
[25:45] [Music]
[25:47] place. You've gone too
[25:50] far and send your day of grace
[25:59] away." Then the sweetest voice I've ever
[26:06] known says, "I'm in control.
[26:13] Oh. So lift up your
[26:17] head. I'm not finished
[26:22] [Music]
[26:26] yet. Lord, help me to
[26:32] see what you see in me.
[26:36] [Music]
[26:40] and help me to
[26:42] [Music]
[26:45] know that you're in control.
[26:52] And when my eyes can't
[26:56] [Music]
[26:58] see my
[27:00] [Music]
[27:05] victory, I will
[27:08] believe you'll finish the work in me.
[27:14] [Music]
[27:19] Someday soon you'll look for
[27:24] me and I'll be
[27:31] gone. I know my flesh looks
[27:37] weak and I stumble and fall.
[27:42] [Music]
[27:45] But Jesus
[27:47] promised
[27:50] me that he'll take me
[27:57] home. So my soul can
[28:01] rest on every word he
[28:07] [Music]
[28:10] said. Lord, help me to
[28:16] see what you see in
[28:23] me. And help me to
[28:29] know that you're in control.
[28:36] And when my eyes can
[28:40] [Music]
[28:43] see my
[28:49] victory, I will
[28:52] believe you'll finish the work in me.
[28:59] [Music]
[29:03] Help me to
[29:08] see what you see in
[29:15] me. And help me to
[29:21] know that you're in control.
[29:28] And when my eyes can
[29:34] see my
[29:41] victory, I will
[29:44] believe you'll finish the work in me.
[29:54] And my eyes can
[30:00] see my
[30:01] [Music]
[30:07] victory. I will
[30:09] believe you'll finish the work in me.
[30:17] [Applause]
[30:28] Amen. Just want to say that's the
[30:31] revelation of Jesus Christ to you. Amen.
[30:34] It's him opening your eyes to show you
[30:37] the work that he's done on your behalf
[30:39] and that you could just step in and
[30:41] accept it and know that he's not just
[30:44] the author, he's the finisher also. the
[30:47] what he started. He's never started
[30:48] anything that he didn't finish. Once he
[30:51] starts, he's already got a finishing
[30:53] point in mind and we're certainly
[30:55] thankful for that. We don't have any new
[30:57] written requests. We want to continue to
[30:59] remember our brother uh sister Raquel
[31:01] and brother Jose and pray for sister
[31:04] Raquel's and um speedy recovery and that
[31:08] the Lord will be with them and bring
[31:09] them back safe home as sister Rebecca
[31:12] has to be remembered. I want to remember
[31:14] her. And I know there's many traveling
[31:17] as this traveling season. Our brother
[31:19] Matthew was out preaching. We pray that
[31:20] the Lord will bring him back safe home.
[31:23] And we had this this morning to remember
[31:25] Caitlyn. Uh she was uh rushed to the ER
[31:30] with severe panic attack. And this
[31:32] morning and uh she need deliverance from
[31:35] depression and anxiety. Also, sister
[31:38] Sandy writes, um, "Please pray on my
[31:42] left foot healing and for my left foot
[31:44] healing and the right eye healing of uh,
[31:48] aneurysm." Amen. We know he's the healer
[31:51] of all our diseases. I am the Lord that
[31:54] health thee. If you have a need upon
[31:56] your heart, just lift your hand up to
[31:57] him. Brother Benjamin Cabay, if I could
[32:00] just come and take these needs before
[32:01] the Lord and Amen. We can certainly come
[32:05] with confidence before the throne of
[32:06] grace to know that it was all that's
[32:09] where it was all made available for us.
[32:14] [Music]
[32:16] Amen. Let's pray. God Almighty, we thank
[32:20] you once more, Lord, for invite us back
[32:22] into your house, Lord, with the song
[32:24] that just being sang, Lord, matching
[32:26] with what was preached this morning.
[32:28] Lord bring me to remembrance about David
[32:31] saying Lord remember your promise to
[32:33] your servant
[32:34] Lord because your promise Lord brings me
[32:38] life Lord and Lord we know by the
[32:41] preaching on this morning Lord it was
[32:44] not something new Lord but we're
[32:45] bringing back into remembrance Lord of
[32:47] what we have Lord the potential that we
[32:49] have in our life Lord the power that we
[32:51] have Lord is the promise Lord this
[32:53] promises Lord it's grace that we have
[32:56] been revealed that we have this promise
[32:57] Lord It's not just that we have this
[32:59] promise, but we have somebody that
[33:01] promised this and we are certain of the
[33:02] power that this individual hold and that
[33:05] is our God Almighty. Lord, and we know
[33:07] that we have been promised healing,
[33:08] Lord. We bring our sister with her left
[33:11] foot and right foot, Lord. We've been
[33:13] promised deliverance, Lord. We bring
[33:14] Caitlyn to you, Lord, asking for you to
[33:17] deliver her, Lord. Give her peace, Lord.
[33:19] You've promised us peace, Lord. You said
[33:21] joy is for a believer, Lord. And we are
[33:23] believing for her to have joy in her
[33:26] life, Lord. To have peace in her life,
[33:28] Lord. These these are spirit Lord. And
[33:30] we know your prophet told us anxiety,
[33:31] depression, it's just evil spirits. It's
[33:33] the devil coming to bother your your
[33:35] daughter Lord. She's your daughter Lord.
[33:37] And we bring her to you Lord. Lord,
[33:40] these all these requests Lord bring

[37:49] night. Fear filled their
[37:52] hearts. They felt they would die. They
[37:57] failed to
[37:59] remember that the master was kind.
[38:04] He spoke the
[38:06] words and the wind stood still.
[38:12] Even the
[38:14] waters they obey his will. He
[38:21] comes just like
[38:24] you. If I don't just
[38:28] remember that it is deep inside.
[38:32] Oh, and why should I
[38:36] worry? Why should I fear when the city
[38:41] is saying
[38:43] Jesus is always so near? It is in my
[38:50] heart and he hears when I cry. I call
[38:56] his
[38:57] [Music]
[39:01] nameless. We read in the
[39:06] Bible with
[39:08] him. Brought light to the
[39:11] darkness when the way restored him. How
[39:16] great it would
[39:18] be to have
[39:22] sleeping and walk with the master.
[39:27] All of the
[39:30] time
[39:36] when I'll search for the
[39:40] master
[39:43] be and when I'm in
[39:46] [Music]
[39:51] tr all I have to
[39:54] do is
[39:56] his
[39:58] name. Oh, why should I
[40:01] worry? Oh, why should I fear with the
[40:06] very same
[40:09] Jesus always?
[40:13] Oh, he lives in my
[40:15] heart and
[40:19] he I call on his
[40:22] name. Let's all sing and sing it again.
[40:26] Oh, and why should I?
[40:30] Oh, and why should I fear
[40:35] when
[40:37] Jesus is always on here? He lives in my
[40:43] heart and he is
[40:48] I call on his name.
[40:52] Sing that second verse as we find our
[40:55] pastor in the
[40:58] Bible. How he walked with them. Brought
[41:02] light to their darkness.
[41:06] When the way crew showed him how great
[41:10] it would
[41:11] be to have his step
[41:14] sleeping behind and walk with the
[41:19] master all the time. And when trial
[41:26] comes and death seems
[41:29] so I'll search for the master. You said
[41:34] I'll be there all time. And when I'm in
[41:39] trouble and my
[41:43] body, all I have to do
[41:50] is why should I
[41:54] worry? Why should I fear? to the very
[41:59] same
[42:00] Jesus. He is always so near. He lives in
[42:06] my
[42:07] heart and
[42:11] he call his name.
[42:18] Oh, and why should
[42:23] I be? Oh, and when the very same
[42:28] Jesus is always so near, he is in my
[42:35] heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll
[42:40] call on his name till the storm passes.
[42:50] Thank you. Let's pray. Our gracious
[42:52] father, we ask you to bless us this
[42:54] evening. And we've come
[42:56] together, Father, to keep thy
[42:59] word. Thy word is
[43:02] truth, Father. And the truth is what
[43:05] sets us
[43:06] free, Father. We can come to communion
[43:09] when we're sick. We come to communion
[43:12] when we're weary and we have
[43:15] problems, Father, because there's
[43:18] healing in communion. and we just ask
[43:21] that you would bless it to us and help
[43:24] us. We pray that your goodness would be
[43:27] our
[43:28] portion. And we know that you can do all
[43:31] things through Christ Jesus who
[43:34] strengthens us. And Father, we come to
[43:37] commune with
[43:38] you to
[43:40] remember the price that was paid for the
[43:45] power that you've given
[43:47] us. that it didn't come without a
[43:50] cost. And we take communion
[43:53] acknowledging that you paid the
[43:57] price. And
[43:59] Father, as I've said many times, you get
[44:02] what you paid for. What you
[44:06] purchased, all the divine power that was
[44:10] in you, you poured into your church. And
[44:15] father, that's what communion is to us.
[44:18] And we want to thank you for it. In
[44:21] Jesus precious and wonderful and holy
[44:25] name we pray.
[44:27] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's let's just turn
[44:31] in our Bibles to Hebrews
[44:34] uh real quick. And
[44:40] uh and uh did I what did I do with my
[44:44] glasses? Did I bring my glasses out
[44:47] here?
[44:49] Well, that's what happens when you get
[44:53] old.
[44:54] Amen. Are are you are you ready for
[44:57] getting old? Anybody?
[44:59] [Music]
[45:01] Uh so anyway, let me just pick a
[45:05] scripture. Without faith, it's
[45:07] impossible to please God. God bless you.
[45:10] You may be seated.
[45:15] Did you get
[45:18] lost? Anyway, praise the Lord. We want
[45:20] to just uh fellowship with you a little
[45:23] bit before communion uh because um we
[45:27] definitely you know don't want to have a
[45:29] service without the word a after
[45:32] everything that our prophet told us
[45:36] concerning the word. And there was a
[45:38] little statement in here that our
[45:40] messenger made that I I want to um uh uh
[45:46] amplify, if
[45:48] that's the word that I could use. Not
[45:51] that I'm capable of that, but to kind of
[45:56] um encourage you and get an
[45:59] understanding of why that we are in the
[46:02] circumstance that we are
[46:05] in in the midst of a unbelieving world.
[46:11] You would think
[46:12] that the world would draw closer to God.
[46:16] But we come to find out that it's not
[46:19] drawing closer. It's going further and
[46:22] further from God. And we know the curse
[46:26] of the age is that they no longer wish
[46:30] to retain God in their
[46:32] knowledge. So God give them over to a
[46:35] reprobate mind and brands them with the
[46:38] hot iron. And so Lesie and I coming back
[46:43] from lunch today, we drove by the
[46:48] ballpark and there all the kids were out
[46:51] playing
[46:52] baseball on Sunday. And when our kids
[46:57] were brought forth when we came to
[47:01] Texas, you
[47:02] didn't play baseball on Sunday. They
[47:07] didn't play baseball or have practice on
[47:11] Wednesday. In fact, we had what we
[47:14] called in the state of Texas blue
[47:18] laws. And uh there's a couple old-timers
[47:22] nodding their head here that remember
[47:25] that you couldn't buy alcohol.
[47:28] You couldn't buy cigarettes. you could
[47:31] only buy certain items like bread, milk
[47:37] and and it was and they they absolutely
[47:40] protected Sunday
[47:42] morning. But
[47:45] then you know the love of money came in
[47:51] and they begin to drop the standard and
[47:53] lower the standard and things begin to
[47:57] go downhill. And the more that they went
[48:00] downhill in reality, the more they came
[48:04] up with
[48:05] religion, which is a covering, which is
[48:09] an intellectual conception of what they
[48:12] believe, but it never transferred from
[48:16] what they believed into the way that
[48:20] they live.
[48:22] And the path forward for the church is
[48:25] what God wants to see in the church is
[48:29] everything we
[48:31] believe. Everything we see in the
[48:33] scriptures. Everything that's been
[48:36] revealed to it transformed into a
[48:40] working life. A life that's about the
[48:43] father's business. A life with power. A
[48:47] life that possesses the gates of the
[48:49] enemy. the life that sits there and and
[48:52] meets Satan and says, "This is not
[48:54] according to the word of God. Satan, get
[48:58] out of my way. I'm possessing that
[49:01] gate." It has power. In fact, the
[49:04] prophet of God said that they become the
[49:06] master of every circumstance. And so, he
[49:11] he's trying to take us from all that we
[49:14] believe to have faith in who that we
[49:19] are. and then take that faith and not
[49:22] just hold on to it. I mean, no, I don't
[49:25] mean it that way. To hold on to it and
[49:28] cling to it, but by that faith do the
[49:32] works that he told us to do. And so, he
[49:37] makes this statement and we and before
[49:40] communion, I'm going to have uh David uh
[49:42] Jr. take our our communion uh for us
[49:47] tonight and read the scriptures. He
[49:49] said, 'W wait a minute. He said, "See,
[49:52] my time piece is turning just exactly
[49:56] right." So, Brother Bram talked about
[49:58] seeing all the records and seeing all
[50:01] the corruption in the world. And he
[50:03] stands back and says, "Wait a minute.
[50:05] This has all been
[50:07] prophesied. It's all working exactly
[50:11] according to the plan. My time piece is
[50:14] turning exactly right. I've got to put
[50:16] you upon the same basis I did the first
[50:21] man in them days and I put you on the
[50:25] same basis of Luther and
[50:29] Wesley on the same basis of Luther and
[50:32] the same basis of
[50:34] Wesley. So I just wanted to talk about
[50:37] that same
[50:38] basis. So in other words,
[50:41] Wesley, Luther and Wesley, what
[50:46] transpired in their
[50:49] generation, we are put on the same basis
[50:53] that they are. So the same challenges,
[50:56] the same things. So the first thing that
[50:59] we would talk about about uh Wesley and
[51:03] them is that the first thing is God gave
[51:06] them something to believe.
[51:10] a furtherance of the word.
[51:14] So you not the same old doctrine, not
[51:18] the same old teaching, not the same old
[51:22] traditions. He gave them a furtherance
[51:25] of the word. He gave them something
[51:28] that, if I might just say it this way,
[51:31] that wasn't the same old
[51:33] crop. You know what I mean? It was fresh
[51:36] mana. It was opened up. So there was a
[51:41] opening, a a revealing, something that
[51:45] was hid within the scriptures, something
[51:48] that the horse riders buried away. This
[51:51] messenger comes forth now and he he sees
[51:56] something and he sees it in the word of
[51:58] God. And so he's given something to
[52:02] believe just like you've been given
[52:05] something to believe in your age,
[52:09] something out of the
[52:11] norm, something that's not popular.
[52:14] Okay? And he gave them opposition.
[52:20] So what they believed they they the
[52:24] people were opposed to.
[52:27] They didn't just
[52:28] Wesley and and
[52:31] Luther, they just didn't say what they
[52:35] had to say without
[52:38] criticism. And and then finally, he gave
[52:42] them a reward for keeping his word.
[52:48] Now, just take Luther for an example. So
[52:53] Luther
[52:57] He in reading the scriptures and looking
[53:01] at the condition. Can you imagine when
[53:03] the spirit of God moved upon him and
[53:08] Luther first
[53:10] great move that he made was standing
[53:16] against the authority of the pope.
[53:22] No, the Pope isn't the vicer of
[53:26] Christ. He's not God on earth. His word
[53:33] is not the absolute truth. Now, the
[53:37] whole world is
[53:40] Catholic. The Pope has influence in who
[53:44] becomes king in in in in peacemaking. He
[53:48] rules the government.
[53:51] He the the the churches are all based on
[53:55] uh on getting permission from the pope.
[53:59] He's running almost he's running the
[54:01] whole show. Everybody's a uh believes in
[54:06] the Catholic faith and thus their
[54:08] doctrine the one and only true
[54:12] faith and they had their apostles
[54:15] creed you know and so now Luther is
[54:19] given
[54:21] something to believe he now sees that
[54:25] there's
[54:27] justification and and uh uh that there's
[54:33] uh uh that and he protested the Catholic
[54:38] Church. He now says that he's now
[54:41] realizes and speaks to the people saying
[54:45] that you don't have to do penance for
[54:47] your
[54:49] sins. Your sins are forgiven by
[54:53] grace, not by suffering.
[54:57] And now the Catholic Church is making
[54:59] millions of dollars on
[55:02] penance. You light a candle. You have to
[55:06] do something to get your forgiveness.
[55:10] You have to say so many Hail Maryries.
[55:12] You have to do so much so many uh
[55:15] prayers. You have to fast. You have to
[55:18] do all these things to be forgiven. And
[55:22] then John Wesley comes around and he
[55:24] realizes it's by grace that you're saved
[55:30] and and you're justified by faith. So
[55:34] Wes Wesley he he began to stand there
[55:38] and he began to realize that it was by
[55:42] faith that you are saved. And and when
[55:47] he that message that he got, John Calvin
[55:51] began to pick up and and they began to
[55:55] preach, you're saved by faith, not by
[55:58] works, not by anything else you do. Uh
[56:01] just by faith. And then he believed that
[56:05] the whole church was a priesthood.
[56:09] But you know, they begin to run out on a
[56:13] limb. You know what I mean? you're saved
[56:15] by faith. If if I believe, I'm saved.
[56:19] And there was nothing. Uh and that was
[56:22] good for the hour that it was in cuz
[56:25] people were coming out. And and the
[56:28] reward for
[56:30] that was to for a man to know that Jesus
[56:35] died for his sins and he was forgiven
[56:38] and it was a free gift of God, not an
[56:42] earned gift by fulfilling
[56:46] penance. That was a reward to
[56:50] them to really have a revelation of
[56:53] Jesus Christ dying for their sins.
[56:57] And that can you imagine if every day
[57:00] you had to do something for your
[57:04] sins? That's the condition of the
[57:07] Catholic
[57:08] Church. You know, I I I I I oppose that.
[57:13] But I even experienced with my mother in
[57:17] the last
[57:20] uh few weeks of her
[57:23] death, she wouldn't take any pain pills.
[57:26] We feel she had a cracked pelvis or her
[57:29] back was in excruciating pain and we had
[57:32] to move her and and and she wouldn't
[57:35] take any any uh uh medicine for the
[57:41] pain. And I I I didn't understand it.
[57:43] And then she said, you know, I I'm I'm
[57:46] I'm taking this pain and suffering for
[57:50] my
[57:53] sins. And I thought, that's just the
[57:57] opposite. We have a Jesus that makes you
[58:00] whole. We have a Jesus that suffers for
[58:03] you. You don't have to suffer, Mom, for
[58:06] your sins. They've already been thrown
[58:10] in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be
[58:13] remembered no
[58:16] more. And
[58:18] so Luther had to do two things. One, he
[58:23] had to
[58:24] accept a
[58:26] revelation that was contrary to the
[58:30] trend of the day. He had to accept a
[58:33] revelation that was not taught or
[58:37] believed by the
[58:39] establishment. He had to accept
[58:41] something that that had never been
[58:46] presented before. So it wasn't it wasn't
[58:51] uh
[58:52] proven in any way.
[58:56] But God proved that it was God because
[59:00] God had believers there to believe
[59:05] it. He wasn't the only one that saw it.
[59:09] There was an elect people that read what
[59:12] he read and read the scriptures and they
[59:14] begin to say that's true and and and and
[59:18] I see that that's right and that is and
[59:21] then they begin to experience.
[59:25] Let me say this. They began to
[59:29] experience the reward of that age.
[59:34] They began to to they not only saw it in
[59:39] truth, but they experienced the
[59:42] forgiving grace of God and the freedom
[59:47] from their sin and the freedom that God
[59:51] could not that they no longer would
[59:54] continue as a sinner, but now they were
[59:57] set free by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:00] So there was a
[1:00:03] spirit for that
[1:00:06] age and they received the spirit of that
[1:00:10] age and they begin to walk in the light
[1:00:14] and the truth. But what happened is they
[1:00:17] begin to get away with it. And Calvinism
[1:00:20] is that you're saved by faith
[1:00:24] alone. And it's a partial truth.
[1:00:29] It's
[1:00:31] true and every aspect of it is true, but
[1:00:35] it's not the whole truth.
[1:00:39] You understand what I'm saying? Someone
[1:00:42] could tell you a truth and yet in one
[1:00:45] way be lying to you because they're
[1:00:48] withholding other truths.
[1:00:53] You
[1:00:54] know, did you drive the car? Yes, I
[1:00:56] drove the car.
[1:01:00] Now, they didn't say that they got in a
[1:01:03] wreck. They withheld
[1:01:05] that. You know, I had a friend, he had a
[1:01:08] car and he had a couple boys and he told
[1:01:11] them, he went on a trip and he said,
[1:01:13] "Whatever you
[1:01:15] do, don't drive the car."
[1:01:20] So, what do you think the first thing
[1:01:22] that happened when they got their first
[1:01:25] phone call from and they knew they were
[1:01:27] out of town for sure? Well, they decided
[1:01:30] they might as well drive the car. Nobody
[1:01:34] would know, you know. So, they took the
[1:01:36] car and they went driving the car. Well,
[1:01:39] they were driving the car and they got
[1:01:42] in a circumstance where they kind of hit
[1:01:44] a curb or they hit something in the
[1:01:47] road. And so, you know, they didn't
[1:01:50] think nothing of it, but when they got
[1:01:53] home, they looked at the car and it had
[1:01:56] a dent up on the side of it and they
[1:02:00] thought, "Oh
[1:02:01] no, my goodness. I'm going to get
[1:02:04] caught."
[1:02:05] So they gathered some money together,
[1:02:08] went to a body shop and and made sure
[1:02:12] the guy got it fixed and he fixed it and
[1:02:16] everything so it looked perfect and they
[1:02:17] put it right back in the garage exactly
[1:02:20] where it was to everything. And the
[1:02:23] parents come home and and and they're
[1:02:25] looking around and they they they notice
[1:02:28] the car. I said, "Did you drive the
[1:02:29] car?"
[1:02:34] you know, and they said, "Well, I'll
[1:02:36] tell you something. It's amazing because
[1:02:39] when I left, that car had a great big
[1:02:41] dent in it that your mother put there a
[1:02:45] few weeks ago, and now it
[1:02:51] doesn't." You see, in other words, doing
[1:02:54] the
[1:02:55] work, you know, isn't
[1:02:59] what did it, you know. So they were
[1:03:02] caught anyway.
[1:03:05] And and and so the the whole truth of it
[1:03:10] is is we are justified by faith. But
[1:03:13] then
[1:03:14] Wesley came along and he said, "Not only
[1:03:18] you're justified by faith, but you've
[1:03:20] got your faith has to have works
[1:03:24] accompanying with it.
[1:03:26] Show me your faith without your works,
[1:03:30] and I'll show you my faith by your
[1:03:33] works. Show me that you're justified
[1:03:37] without the proof and evidence in your
[1:03:41] life that you've been justified. Because
[1:03:44] the the Calvinists, they begin to be
[1:03:47] able to mix with the world and do things
[1:03:50] in the world. And Wesley comes up in a
[1:03:52] new revelation and stands up and says
[1:03:57] no. So he had
[1:03:59] opposition to move forward to go forward
[1:04:03] in the word. He had
[1:04:07] opposition. He had he the Calvinist rose
[1:04:11] up against
[1:04:12] him and telling them
[1:04:16] no. You know they they both and and
[1:04:21] uh they both believed in communion as
[1:04:25] being a part of uh the Christian life.
[1:04:30] They understood that Luther got rid of
[1:04:32] all the other sacraments and everything
[1:04:36] and and you know what they believed. Now
[1:04:39] Wesley comes along and he begins to he
[1:04:42] adds sanctification to
[1:04:45] justification. And then he uh he he
[1:04:48] begin to uh meet resistance because he
[1:04:52] began to preach the believer should have
[1:04:55] works. It's part of
[1:04:58] salvation. In other words, you can say
[1:05:00] you're saved, but if you don't have a
[1:05:03] saved person's work, you're not.
[1:05:07] Oh my goodness, did he ever meet a bunch
[1:05:11] of trouble.
[1:05:14] In fact, they wanted to excommunicate
[1:05:16] him. But God had believers there
[1:05:21] that saw that, believed it. And not only
[1:05:24] did they see it and believed it, but
[1:05:28] they
[1:05:29] experienced the
[1:05:31] grace and the spirit of that age. And
[1:05:36] Wesley taught the Christian
[1:05:41] discipline, praying about what you do,
[1:05:44] knowing where you go, dressing right,
[1:05:47] acting right, keeping your life subject
[1:05:51] to the word of God. He taught that. And
[1:05:54] can you imagine the great reward that
[1:05:56] came to believer knowing that their
[1:06:00] sanctification pleased
[1:06:03] God? and then we come to our
[1:06:08] day. So if we're here on the same basis,
[1:06:12] then we're going to be given something
[1:06:15] out of the ordinary to believe.
[1:06:22] We come in our day and now
[1:06:25] we
[1:06:28] recognize by
[1:06:30] Isab that the ministry of the son of man
[1:06:34] has come in our day that God veiled
[1:06:38] deity in a messenger. So now we see we
[1:06:43] have Malachi 4:5. This man performs
[1:06:46] Malachi 4:5. Well, all the Carmelites
[1:06:50] and all the Calvinists and all the
[1:06:52] Pentecostals, they go
[1:06:57] ape.
[1:06:59] No, that's not true. That isn't that
[1:07:02] that's John the
[1:07:04] Baptist, you know, that's that's not
[1:07:07] that they don't believe in five
[1:07:09] comingings of Elijah. They're raising up
[1:07:12] and but yet here's given something to
[1:07:15] believe.
[1:07:17] You believe that that
[1:07:19] that the Lord Jesus promised to come to
[1:07:24] the Gentiles and that he was going to
[1:07:27] have a coming in our day. And he came
[1:07:30] and he availed himself in human flesh.
[1:07:34] And through that body, he did the same
[1:07:38] works he did 2,000 years ago. Discerning
[1:07:41] the thoughts and intents of the heart,
[1:07:43] turning his back to the audience,
[1:07:45] casting out devils, raising the dead, do
[1:07:48] all those things. That was him
[1:07:51] veiled in a
[1:07:55] man. And he asked us to believe that.
[1:08:00] He asked us to believe that there was be
[1:08:02] a calling
[1:08:03] out from the denominational system and
[1:08:07] that the doctrines and secrets of the
[1:08:09] Bible would be opened in our day.
[1:08:13] Now, we're on the same basis they
[1:08:17] are. So, we have to be given something
[1:08:20] to believe.
[1:08:23] That's what separates us
[1:08:27] is what's been revealed to us is what
[1:08:30] separates us. That's what separates us
[1:08:34] from the impersonator.
[1:08:37] Is that the word's been given to us.
[1:08:40] Something's been given to us to
[1:08:42] believe. And now there's a
[1:08:47] believer to accept it.
[1:08:52] Somebody's there is going to prove it's
[1:08:54] true.
[1:08:57] And so we find out that that as Wesley
[1:09:02] preached that he meant the
[1:09:04] opposition of the Calvinists.
[1:09:08] Just like we would meet the opposition
[1:09:10] of the Pentecostals.
[1:09:14] You know what do you mean? You don't
[1:09:16] shout. You don't speak with
[1:09:18] tongues. You don't have all this
[1:09:20] emotion. And now you're standing back
[1:09:23] and saying, "Well, we do, but our faith
[1:09:26] is based on the revealed word of God.
[1:09:29] What on the we believe in what promises
[1:09:32] have come to pass, not by experience.
[1:09:36] The church wasn't built on experience."
[1:09:39] And the Pentecostal church was preaching
[1:09:41] experience. They were preaching emotion.
[1:09:45] that. In other words, they believed if
[1:09:47] they felt the Holy Spirit led them to do
[1:09:50] something that was greater and above
[1:09:54] what the scripture said. And and people
[1:09:57] that have been in Pentecost realize that
[1:10:00] many of them would actually tell you
[1:10:03] that they're led of the spirit and the
[1:10:05] very things that they were doing were
[1:10:07] contrary to scripture.
[1:10:11] But it was all about
[1:10:15] spirit and it wasn't the
[1:10:17] mixture of
[1:10:19] spirit and
[1:10:23] truth. And now can you
[1:10:27] imagine? And now God comes and gives us
[1:10:32] something to believe. And we meet the
[1:10:36] opposition. And now our
[1:10:39] reward is to know that we have
[1:10:44] truth. And the truth has been proved to
[1:10:47] us that this is the truth. And we know
[1:10:51] that our reward is a rapture and a
[1:10:55] resurrection
[1:10:56] and that we are not stuck in the
[1:11:00] deception of the world gone by. And it's
[1:11:03] just like the children of
[1:11:05] Israel when they come out. And God does
[1:11:08] this in every age. He makes a move in
[1:11:12] the spirit. And all the unbelievers that
[1:11:16] don't believe, they perish.
[1:11:19] and God moves
[1:11:21] on. And and and that's what happened
[1:11:24] with Israel. Israel was given a
[1:11:27] chance to
[1:11:30] believe every promise of God that that
[1:11:34] was their line
[1:11:35] land. They walked right up to the land
[1:11:39] and saw that it was everything that God
[1:11:42] said it would be.
[1:11:44] They walked up to the land and then when
[1:11:46] they they saw that the land was
[1:11:48] possessed with
[1:11:50] opposition and possessed with
[1:11:53] giants and and
[1:11:56] they they got there and the very God
[1:11:59] that destroyed Egypt in just a very
[1:12:03] months day time to get to that land they
[1:12:07] already forgot what God had done for
[1:12:10] them and they refused to cross over at
[1:12:15] Kadesh
[1:12:16] Barnea and God had to get all the
[1:12:22] unbelief and he let every unbeliever
[1:12:26] perish and then he went over with true
[1:12:29] believers. He went over with Joshua and
[1:12:33] Caleb and the their the
[1:12:36] their
[1:12:38] children because all those that had the
[1:12:40] opportunity to enter into that land all
[1:12:43] disbelieved and they all perish. Now
[1:12:46] there's nothing but Joshua and Caleb and
[1:12:50] the children of
[1:12:54] those and we are the
[1:12:56] children being returned back to the
[1:13:00] faith of our fathers and Joshua
[1:13:03] represents the Holy
[1:13:07] Spirit. The spirit of God is to lead us
[1:13:12] in to the land of promise where every
[1:13:17] promise is
[1:13:20] ours. We're justified by our
[1:13:25] calling. We're sanctified by the
[1:13:28] obedience and potential in the work. And
[1:13:31] finally, we become possessors. And we
[1:13:34] possess the promises and we possess the
[1:13:38] line. And now we just don't become
[1:13:40] hearers of the word, but we become what?
[1:13:43] Doers of the word.
[1:13:48] Think of it. And how does he do it? How
[1:13:52] did he bring it all to pass? How did
[1:13:55] Wesley get to where he was? Because God
[1:13:58] provided him believers.
[1:14:01] How did Luther get to where he was?
[1:14:04] Because God provided him believers. How
[1:14:07] did this message get to where it is
[1:14:09] today? Because God provided him
[1:14:13] believers. And and so I'd like just to
[1:14:17] read this. I love this statement.
[1:14:20] And and he says here he says he promised
[1:14:24] his seed would be be a stranger in a
[1:14:27] strange land and would be misjudged by
[1:14:30] the people as they sojourned. Isn't that
[1:14:36] exactly how we
[1:14:38] are? I hate it when people misjudge
[1:14:42] me. You don't you you follow a man. No,
[1:14:46] I don't.
[1:14:49] There's there's only one place that God
[1:14:51] meets a man under a shed blood. You're
[1:14:53] in a cult. No, I'm not. This isn't a
[1:14:58] cult. This is the true church of the
[1:15:00] living God. This is the elect lady. This
[1:15:04] is the bride. I'm not in a cult. I'm no
[1:15:07] different than anybody else. I might not
[1:15:10] do the worldly things, and I might have
[1:15:12] sanctification and holiness in my life,
[1:15:15] but I feel just the way you do.
[1:15:19] Well, you all dress a certain
[1:15:21] way. You know, you you don't wear
[1:15:26] shorts. Every time I meet some of my
[1:15:29] friends that aren't believers, they they
[1:15:32] Why don't you ever wear
[1:15:34] shorts? Of course, I'm always nice with
[1:15:37] them. I know if you said if you saw my
[1:15:39] legs, you wouldn't wear shorts either,
[1:15:41] you know. But then I I explained to him.
[1:15:43] I says, "Well, I'm a Christian and this
[1:15:45] is part of our faith.
[1:15:49] They just don't understand it. You got
[1:15:52] reproach and you bear the
[1:15:55] reproach. You know, I I I have sat down
[1:15:59] with many a guy says, "Oh, you know that
[1:16:02] uh I think it was John Haggy or I don't
[1:16:05] want to get wrong if it wasn't him, but
[1:16:07] said, you know, he prophesied brother
[1:16:08] Brandham's death." Yeah. They always
[1:16:11] prophesy after the
[1:16:15] fact, you know, they they they see
[1:16:19] something and then the event happens and
[1:16:22] they say, "Oh, yeah. This is the this is
[1:16:25] the fulfillment of it over here." That's
[1:16:27] not the way brother Brandon prophesied.
[1:16:29] He told you the name, the place, the
[1:16:31] position, and everything. And the time
[1:16:34] when he said when he said Deus
[1:16:36] Shagarian's daughter was going to die at
[1:16:39] 3:00 a.m. or whatever time it was, he
[1:16:42] told her she was going to die, when she
[1:16:44] was going to die, and why she was going
[1:16:46] to die. And guess what happened? She
[1:16:50] died. And after he prophesied that and
[1:16:53] spoke that, they all stood up and said,
[1:16:56] "Oh, God's Pharisee and the power of the
[1:17:00] resurrection, go into her room." and
[1:17:03] she's going to rise up in a mighty way
[1:17:05] and and she's going to be a testimony
[1:17:08] for the world. And 400 of
[1:17:12] them all
[1:17:14] prophesying. And what do you think
[1:17:17] happened? It happened exactly the way
[1:17:21] that God said it would happen.
[1:17:27] And that's the one thing that you
[1:17:29] can trust
[1:17:32] in. If God said he'd give you your
[1:17:35] children, he's going to give you your
[1:17:36] children. I don't know when, I don't
[1:17:40] know how, but it's a
[1:17:43] promise and we believe the
[1:17:46] promises. And then I'd like to close
[1:17:48] with this and Davey will get prepared to
[1:17:51] come and read. He says,
[1:17:55] "Notice." He
[1:18:02] says, he says, "Watch when they got to
[1:18:04] Kadesh Barnea."
[1:18:06] At Kadesh Bernese, Moses sent
[1:18:10] out sent out
[1:18:13] one out of each tribe to go spy on the
[1:18:17] land and see which
[1:18:21] way they was to enter. And he sent his
[1:18:25] general
[1:18:27] Joshua, which uh which was a prophet,
[1:18:32] and he sent minor prophets under Moses.
[1:18:36] and Joshua listened to Moses and they
[1:18:39] sent them out to go spy the land. And
[1:18:42] and then we find out that he said, "And
[1:18:45] no matter what or how close you are to
[1:18:49] Jordan, no matter what your circumstance
[1:18:52] is, if you could only hold that promise
[1:18:56] of God in your heart, God will prove it,
[1:19:01] that it's so." In the midst of all
[1:19:05] unbelief, he still will prove it to be
[1:19:08] so. God will still prove this message to
[1:19:13] be true. No matter how ugly they draw
[1:19:16] it, no matter if how many believe the
[1:19:20] sign message guys they bring up, no
[1:19:24] matter how many voices, the people that
[1:19:27] get so obsessed with trying to disprove
[1:19:30] the message, they're actually mentally
[1:19:34] demonpossessed. They wake up in the
[1:19:36] morning. How can I disprove this
[1:19:38] message? They're on the podcast. I up to
[1:19:40] say this message. They criticize every
[1:19:43] brother thing brother Brandham said.
[1:19:45] They point to the cloud. They point to
[1:19:47] this. They point to that. It don't
[1:19:49] matter
[1:19:52] how much they think they can disprove
[1:19:55] this message. The one thing they can't
[1:19:57] take from me is divine revelation
[1:20:02] that God put me here to believe it.
[1:20:06] He put me here to prove that it's true.
[1:20:10] And and the rapture is going to be the
[1:20:13] showdown.
[1:20:18] And I know when that rapture comes, he's
[1:20:22] going to call my name.
[1:20:24] My name's on the Lamb's book of life. He
[1:20:28] said, now notice it was by believers
[1:20:31] that he proves his
[1:20:33] word. He can only prove his word, not by
[1:20:37] unbelievers. It's only by believers that
[1:20:40] he can prove his word. No matter how
[1:20:43] much the rest of them claim to be, oh, I
[1:20:47] believe, brethren. See, if you do, God
[1:20:52] will prove it.
[1:20:54] So, cuz we look and see the
[1:20:59] others. How many people say they believe
[1:21:01] the
[1:21:02] message? How many some say they believe,
[1:21:05] brother Brandham's a prophet of God? And
[1:21:08] look at how many show up for
[1:21:11] communion. You know what the prophet of
[1:21:13] God said? you don't don't take
[1:21:15] communion, you're not going to be there.
[1:21:21] It's a commandment. That's right. But
[1:21:25] over and over again, we make the claim
[1:21:30] of being believer and then the life
[1:21:33] isn't there that identifies it.
[1:21:38] And even our churches
[1:21:40] today, they don't even have communion.
[1:21:44] They don't have footwashing.
[1:21:47] It's not even in their
[1:21:49] agenda. It's not in their program.
[1:21:53] Arbitrarily, because of the laziness of
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:57] people and because of the poor response
[1:22:00] of the people, they took it
[1:22:06] out for the people's
[1:22:08] sake. And then they actually deceive the
[1:22:14] people. They're using the same tactic
[1:22:18] that Wesley used. Oh, we're just abide
[1:22:21] by by faith
[1:22:24] alone. I believe the
[1:22:28] message and then Wesley said,
[1:22:31] "No, I'm talking about us being on the
[1:22:34] same basis, right?" Wesley comes, "No,
[1:22:37] not only do are you saved by faith, but
[1:22:39] you're saved by obedience."
[1:22:42] That's right. Faith without obedience is
[1:22:45] is is no good.
[1:22:49] It's got to be coupled
[1:22:52] with obedience.
[1:22:55] You can say you believe Malachi 4:5 and
[1:22:58] cut your hair.
[1:23:01] You can say you believe Malachi 4:5 and
[1:23:03] wear pants, wear earrings, do all kinds
[1:23:06] of sneaky things,
[1:23:10] but if you're a true
[1:23:12] believer, you obey the word of God. Now,
[1:23:15] I know I'm preaching to the choir,
[1:23:19] but maybe
[1:23:20] by some
[1:23:22] means there's somebody
[1:23:25] listening to the
[1:23:28] sermon tonight.
[1:23:31] And so it doesn't
[1:23:34] matter how we measure our congregation,
[1:23:37] how many people we put in here on
[1:23:40] Sunday or or or or how many baptisms we
[1:23:45] have. If nobody ever can take that
[1:23:48] further
[1:23:50] step into
[1:23:52] communion and into
[1:23:54] footwashing and into a full obedience to
[1:23:58] every word of
[1:23:59] God, then really, how do we prove that
[1:24:03] we are that
[1:24:05] church? Well, you're here
[1:24:08] tonight. You're proving exactly what he
[1:24:11] said. The true church is a small number.
[1:24:17] Many are called
[1:24:19] but few are chosen.
[1:24:24] And it's a reality
[1:24:27] because we're put on the same
[1:24:30] basis. We have to believe and we have to
[1:24:35] obey the same basis that
[1:24:38] Luther and Wesley were put on. That same
[1:24:43] challenge, the same faith and works
[1:24:48] together is the same basis that we're
[1:24:51] here to obey obey the full word of God.
[1:24:54] So the prophet of God said, if you're a
[1:24:56] true believer, anybody can say they
[1:24:58] believe, but a true believer responds to
[1:25:02] every word of God.
[1:25:04] They don't let every
[1:25:06] circumstance and every finance and every
[1:25:10] little problem that comes up keeps them
[1:25:13] from the word of God.
[1:25:18] I know men that have moved, left their
[1:25:21] jobs, their homes everywhere just so
[1:25:24] they could be a to be in a place to have
[1:25:27] communion.
[1:25:31] one of the greatest privileges of the
[1:25:34] church. I can preach longer because it's
[1:25:36] not going to take us five minutes to
[1:25:38] have
[1:25:38] communion because none of the
[1:25:40] unbelievers are here.
[1:25:45] So he
[1:25:52] said he said and he proves his word not
[1:25:57] by those who say they believe but those
[1:25:59] who really believe it. It's by his
[1:26:01] believing children that he proves his
[1:26:04] word.
[1:26:06] Now he had the believers, the old crop
[1:26:09] died off the unbelievers who said we
[1:26:13] couldn't take it. Now let everyone of
[1:26:17] them perish. Why? Every one of
[1:26:21] them. Everyone of them but the
[1:26:25] believers. He who was who who was left.
[1:26:30] Moses had taken been taken to glory and
[1:26:34] the unbelievers had perished in the
[1:26:36] wilderness and this was their children
[1:26:39] and there were only two that crossed
[1:26:43] over and that was the believers Joshua
[1:26:46] and Caleb and then that they was the
[1:26:50] believers they was the ones who crossed
[1:26:53] over it's only it's the only way God can
[1:26:58] do it is by his believing children. So
[1:27:02] you what I'm trying getting at is you've
[1:27:05] got to see your role
[1:27:09] and how important it is to keep the word
[1:27:12] of God to fulfill what God's bringing to
[1:27:17] pass. And when the believers start
[1:27:20] believing it and doing it, the
[1:27:23] unbelievers is going to start to perish.
[1:27:27] A great falling away.
[1:27:30] this clinging on to a crowd and having a
[1:27:35] life of just coming in when you want to
[1:27:38] and showing up to church 15, 20 minutes
[1:27:41] late and molding on in here with no
[1:27:44] respect. Let me tell you something, it's
[1:27:47] not going to last very long. God will
[1:27:50] put an end to it. He will separate the
[1:27:53] believer from the unbeliever because
[1:27:55] God's word calls for total separation
[1:27:58] from
[1:28:01] unbelief. And I shouldn't be preaching
[1:28:03] this to
[1:28:06] you, but when you see it
[1:28:09] happening, when you see one by one the
[1:28:13] world taking them over and their jobs
[1:28:16] taking them over and now you don't see
[1:28:18] them anymore and pretty soon they're
[1:28:20] into another lifestyle and they make
[1:28:23] church once in a
[1:28:25] while and they just drift
[1:28:29] off and before they know it,
[1:28:32] God's moving and they don't know God's
[1:28:36] moving. God's fulfilling his word and
[1:28:39] they don't know God's fulfilling his
[1:28:42] word because they they set up a
[1:28:47] camp. They didn't keep themselves in
[1:28:50] tune. They didn't obey the word. And
[1:28:54] God's not going to ask them to go
[1:28:56] further if they don't have their ABCs.
[1:28:59] He's not going to ask them to go further
[1:29:01] if they're not obeying. He's not going
[1:29:03] to keep heaping unbelief on them. He's
[1:29:07] just going to
[1:29:09] move with the
[1:29:11] believer. He's going to take the
[1:29:14] believer to prove the rapture.
[1:29:17] Do you realize that's the next thing
[1:29:19] that God's got to prove?
[1:29:24] is that there is a rapture
[1:29:27] and that there's an elected people for
[1:29:29] the rapture called the bride.
[1:29:33] And he said, "Whatever you do, don't
[1:29:35] miss it."
[1:29:37] He's going to prove it.
[1:29:40] But he's going to prove the rapture by
[1:29:42] believing believers.
[1:29:45] So, you should be grateful you're here
[1:29:48] tonight. He said,
[1:29:51] And the unbelievers had all perished in
[1:29:53] the wilderness. And this was their
[1:29:55] children. And there was two crossed
[1:29:57] over. That was believers, Joshua and
[1:29:59] Caleb. And they was believers. And they
[1:30:03] was the ones who crossed over. It's only
[1:30:06] It's the only way God can do it is by
[1:30:10] believing children. You believe that?
[1:30:13] All right. His believers was the ones
[1:30:16] that done it. He used them to cross over
[1:30:24] with. God used
[1:30:26] you. He's going to use you to cross over
[1:30:30] in the third
[1:30:32] Exodus. I want you to notice he does it
[1:30:36] that way in every age. He does it every
[1:30:39] time by the same method. He has to take
[1:30:44] believers. And then in order to have
[1:30:48] believers to meet that word, he's got to
[1:30:52] predestinate it to that age. See, he's
[1:30:55] got to predestinate this thing to be
[1:30:59] there to meet the challenge of the age.
[1:31:01] Did you get
[1:31:08] it? Did you feel it? Did you see it? Do
[1:31:12] you understand it? That's what's
[1:31:15] happening today. He's
[1:31:17] predestinated to this by his
[1:31:20] fornowledge. He predestinated Malachi
[1:31:23] 4:5. It's got to happen. And when he
[1:31:27] comes over and predestines anything to
[1:31:30] happen in his word, he will prove his
[1:31:32] word to be so. And when he predests
[1:31:36] anything to happen, he says it'll
[1:31:39] happen. He knows that
[1:31:42] seed will be there just at that time. He
[1:31:48] predestined a bride. She is going to be
[1:31:51] there. Going to be raptured. She's going
[1:31:54] to be there. He predestinated it by his
[1:31:58] fornowledge. And there's nothing that's
[1:32:02] going to stop it.
[1:32:06] What's he do? He predestinates the
[1:32:08] believer. He has communion. He's going
[1:32:11] to predestinate people to be there to
[1:32:14] have communion
[1:32:16] because it's something that he gave the
[1:32:18] church to do. And somebody's going to do
[1:32:20] it. Is water baptism in the name of the
[1:32:24] Lord Jesus Christ a commandment of God?
[1:32:27] Yes. He's going to have somebody, as
[1:32:29] we've seen this morning, be baptized in
[1:32:32] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:34] Christ because it's
[1:32:37] predestinated to be kept alive. And so
[1:32:40] to this evening, you have to understand
[1:32:43] that all that you go through and all the
[1:32:46] struggles and all the
[1:32:48] challenges is the same thing that
[1:32:50] everybody before has went through. the
[1:32:54] true believer in order to keep this
[1:32:58] word. And I'll tell you, it hasn't even
[1:33:02] entered into our hearts the things that
[1:33:06] God hath prepared to them that
[1:33:09] believe. And the sufferings of this
[1:33:11] present world aren't even worthy to be
[1:33:15] compared to the glory that we'll
[1:33:18] receive. What this obedience to this
[1:33:21] word of God's going to do for us, you
[1:33:23] won't imagine. Fear not, little flock.
[1:33:26] It's the father's good pleasure to give
[1:33:28] you the heaven. You believe the word,
[1:33:31] he'll give you every desire of your
[1:33:34] heart.
[1:33:36] He'll give you your jobs. He'll give you
[1:33:38] your mates. He'll give you your health.
[1:33:40] He'll do exceedingly ab above what you
[1:33:44] can even ask or think. God believe
[1:33:49] and holds obedience greater than
[1:33:54] sacrifice. God bless you, brother Dave.
[1:33:57] You can come and do the communion
[1:33:59] reading.
[1:34:04] If you'd stand with
[1:34:11] me, it's 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:34:19] take our text as the deacons prepare.
[1:34:22] We'll give a moment for those just to
[1:34:24] make ready for the communion. Reading
[1:34:27] out of chapter 11 verse
[1:34:29] 23. For I have received of the Lord that
[1:34:32] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:34:35] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:34:37] he was betrayed took bread, and when he
[1:34:40] had given
[1:34:41] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:34:44] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:34:48] you. This do in remembrance of me. After
[1:34:51] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:34:54] when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is
[1:34:57] the new testament in my blood. This do
[1:35:00] ye as often as ye drink it in
[1:35:02] remembrance of me. For as often as ye
[1:35:05] eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
[1:35:08] show the Lord's death till he come.
[1:35:11] Wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
[1:35:14] bread and drink of this cup of the Lord
[1:35:17] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:35:20] and of the blood of the Lord. But let a
[1:35:23] man examine himself. And so let him eat
[1:35:26] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[1:35:29] he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[1:35:31] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[1:35:34] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:35:37] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:35:39] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[1:35:42] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:35:46] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:35:49] chastened of the Lord, that we should
[1:35:51] not be condemned with the world.
[1:35:54] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
[1:35:56] together to eat, tarry one for another.
[1:36:00] If any man hunger, let him eat at home,
[1:36:04] that ye come not together into
[1:36:06] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[1:36:09] order when I come. Let's just take a
[1:36:11] moment as the brothers would come, you
[1:36:15] prepare and tar one for
[1:36:23] another. Gracious heavenly
[1:36:26] father, you said you took the bread.
[1:36:30] This is not an office or thing that is
[1:36:32] done man father but it's done in you as
[1:36:35] we approach your suffer our hearts are
[1:36:38] remembering that we're not worthy our
[1:36:41] righteousness is a filthy rags but we're
[1:36:44] remembering a sacrifice that paid for an
[1:36:46] approach to you Lord we're thanking you
[1:36:49] for that asking your forgiveness we
[1:36:51] receive it we remember it claim it that
[1:36:54] Lord we can be found in communion with
[1:36:56] you Lord we ask that you would Bless
[1:36:59] this bread that represents your body
[1:37:01] that was broken. Lord, it's a paid
[1:37:03] finished work. Lord, wine, Lord, grant
[1:37:06] revelation, Father, that we'll take the
[1:37:08] next step and we'll walk forward with
[1:37:09] you, Lord. As you reveal your word,
[1:37:12] we're going to receive the word for our
[1:37:14] day, every day. Father, walk constantly
[1:37:17] with you. Bless it now, Lord. May each
[1:37:20] one just carry one for another as we
[1:37:22] give it time. Prepare our hearts. In the
[1:37:24] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:37:26] Jesus Christ, we pray.

[1:45:42] Sorry, I think I'm still emotional on
[1:45:44] seeing my our pastor take
[1:45:47] communion with my
[1:45:51] mother. Just need to compose myself. I'm
[1:45:54] sorry.
[1:46:06] Let's read from
[1:46:07] John chapter
[1:46:16] 13. Now before the feast of the
[1:46:19] Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:46:22] was come, that he should depart out of
[1:46:25] this world unto the Father, having loved
[1:46:28] his own which were in the world, he
[1:46:30] loved them unto the end. and supper
[1:46:32] being ended, and the devil having put it
[1:46:34] into the heart of Judas the Scariot
[1:46:37] Simeon's son, to betray him. Jesus
[1:46:40] knoweth that the Father had given him
[1:46:42] all things into his hands, and that he
[1:46:45] was come from God, and went to God. He
[1:46:48] raisth from supper, laid aside his
[1:46:50] garments, and took a towel, and girded
[1:46:53] himself. After that, he pth water into a
[1:46:57] basin, and began to wash the disciples
[1:46:59] feet, and to wipe them with the towel
[1:47:02] wherewith he was
[1:47:03] girded, then cometh he to Simon Peter.
[1:47:07] And Peter saith unto him, Lord, does
[1:47:10] thou wash my feet? Jesus answered, and
[1:47:13] said unto him, What I do, thou knowest
[1:47:16] not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.
[1:47:19] Peter said unto him, Thou shalt never
[1:47:21] wash my feet.' Jesus answered to him,
[1:47:24] "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
[1:47:27] with me." Simon Peter saith unto
[1:47:29] him,"Lord, not only my feet, my feet
[1:47:32] only, but also my hands and my head."
[1:47:35] Jesus saith to him, "He that is washed
[1:47:38] needeth not saved to wash his feet, but
[1:47:41] is clean every wit. And ye are clean,
[1:47:44] but not all. For he knew who should
[1:47:47] betray him." Therefore said he, ye are
[1:47:50] not all clean. So after he had washed
[1:47:53] their feet, and had taken his garments,
[1:47:56] and was set down again, he said unto
[1:47:58] them, "Know ye what I have done for you.
[1:48:03] Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say
[1:48:06] well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord
[1:48:09] and Master, have washed your feet, ye
[1:48:12] also ought to wash one another's feet.
[1:48:16] For I have given you an example, that ye
[1:48:19] should do as I have done to you. Verily
[1:48:23] I say unto you, the servant is no
[1:48:25] greater than his Lord, neither is he
[1:48:28] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:48:30] him. If you know these things, happy are
[1:48:33] ye if you do them. God bless you.

[2:21:44] word a reality to the believer. Is
[2:21:47] certainly thankful for that. Amen.
