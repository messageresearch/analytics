[22:14] the whole goal when we come here we come
[22:17] to hear from Heaven you know if there's
[22:19] anything in life to be attained to is to
[22:22] hear the voice of God personally because
[22:24] this is the hour where there's so many
[22:27] voices there's so so many things that
[22:29] try to Allure our attention say well
[22:31] this is it I got it but oh my the word
[22:34] of God is the anchor amen amen let's bow
[22:38] our heads
[22:39] together our precious Lord
[22:42] Jesus Lord to be able
[22:45] to speak that holy name in prayer father
[22:50] Lord It's what a privilege we have Lord
[22:55] tonight not only to speak it but to know
[22:57] that you can answer her back father Lord
[23:00] you're not some God that is so far away
[23:04] that you can't oh God come tonight and
[23:08] meet our every need father Lord as we
[23:10] look once again into your word father we
[23:14] pray that you would open it up to us
[23:16] Lord a mortal man can turn the pages and
[23:21] he can speak the experiences that you've
[23:24] took him through but father it takes the
[23:27] operation of your Holy Spirit to bring
[23:30] Revelation and that's we call upon that
[23:33] tonight father we pray you bless your
[23:34] people Lord with the food that you
[23:37] stored up Lord and may we be built up
[23:40] father that we can do that which is

[23:44] tonight Lord to just give ourselves over
[23:48] to your faithful hands father we commit
[23:50] the communion and footwash service Lord
[23:53] asking that you be glorified in it and
[23:56] that your people will be strengthened
[23:57] for the glory of God God amen amen
[24:00] praise the lord
[24:02] well been a little bit nervous but
[24:04] praise God we're
[24:07] here maybe if you have your Bibles I'm
[24:10] thinking to share a little thought that
[24:12] came on my heart and we'll just go into
[24:14] Proverbs 23 and this um scripture kind
[24:18] of came into my heart
[24:20] and you know it's sometimes just through
[24:24] a little scripture that the Lord directs
[24:26] you amen that's what that's what directs
[24:29] the believer is the voice of the word
[24:32] amen we'll also be turning to
[24:37] Exodus chapter 12 but there in Proverbs
[24:42] 23 and
[24:43] 11 and
[24:48] 12 for their redeemer is mighty he shall
[24:52] plead their cause with thee applying
[24:56] thine heart unto instruction in thine
[24:58] ears to the words of knowledge amen and
[25:02] also there in Exodus
[25:05] 12 you know I've been reading in Exodus
[25:09] and thinking about we're in a Third
[25:12] Exodus and there was going to be all
[25:15] these plagues that were going to be
[25:16] poured out and the final plague was
[25:19] death and so just kind of as I was going
[25:22] back through I the Lord began to awaken
[25:25] the reality of of what's transpiring in
[25:28] our day there's about to be a bunch of
[25:31] vials and the woses and different things
[25:33] upon the world but praise God God sent a
[25:37] message amen and Vindicated with the
[25:39] prophet that gives us the clear
[25:41] instruction that we can apply our heart
[25:43] to that wisdom amen so there in chapter
[25:45] 12 and verse
[25:47] 12 says for I will pass through the land
[25:50] of Egypt this night and I will Smite all
[25:53] the firstborn of the land of Egypt both
[25:55] man and Beast and against all the gods
[25:59] of Egypt will I execute judgment I am
[26:02] the Lord and the blood shall be unto you
[26:05] for a token upon the houses wherewith ye
[26:08] are and when I see the blood I will pass
[26:12] over you and the plug the plague shall
[26:14] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[26:17] smite the land of Egypt amen you may
[26:19] have your seeds and we trust the Lord
[26:21] will bless the reading of his word to
[26:23] your heart you know I just you know a
[26:26] lot of times as believers we hear
[26:28] certain phrases in the message and
[26:32] sometimes we just need to dig down a
[26:33] little bit and get some more instruction
[26:35] you know there's times where you know
[26:37] you'd be fellowshipping with a brother
[26:39] or in a situation and you know you say
[26:41] you just must be identified with your
[26:45] sacrifice you know and we look at
[26:47] ourselves and we think well this is my
[26:50] identity and then you also a lot of
[26:52] times we say well that's not your true
[26:54] identity when you see behaviors and
[26:57] things that you're doing in different
[26:58] actions you say well this is not who I
[27:01] am this is just what I'm doing and who
[27:03] you are is a son and daughter of God
[27:05] Amen and a lot of times we forget our
[27:07] identity but that's what this message
[27:09] has come to do is reveal our true
[27:12] identity and I just wanted to read a um
[27:16] out of the token message this this
[27:19] message here in um this one is the one
[27:21] he said a token and this is in um I
[27:25] believe it's 0901
[27:29] uh 63 I believe but we're going to pick
[27:32] up here in
[27:35] um I want to say
[27:39] paragraph
[27:41] 66 and it says this and that's the way
[27:46] of a real Christian you know it just
[27:48] reminds me of when brother when Brother
[27:50] David preached out of the way of a true
[27:52] Prophet but he said the way of a a true
[27:54] Christian and this this is just another
[27:57] just coming behind that just to you know
[28:00] point to the to the mark of the High
[28:02] Calling a lot of times as a minister we
[28:05] we go through personal things and and
[28:07] the Lord shows us something it's not
[28:09] that we've attained but that we're
[28:11] pressing towards amen but the Lord put
[28:13] this on my heart so I just wanted to
[28:15] share this little bit with you but he
[28:17] says a the way of a real Christian is
[28:21] self-sacrifice themselves not caring for
[28:24] this world but giving all they got to
[28:26] God what a a vision what a Target what
[28:29] an aim amen he says now this was the
[28:34] perfect lamb Christ was and then through
[28:36] the shed of the shedding of the Lamb the
[28:40] natural lamb in Egypt was the blood was
[28:43] applied and then it was it stood for a
[28:47] token then the blood of this lamb stood
[28:50] for the token that we are dead to
[28:54] ourselves and identified with our
[28:57] sacrifice then the lamb and the blood
[29:00] and the person becomes identified
[29:03] together the sacrifice and the believer
[29:07] amen oh I love that that just makes it
[29:09] so plain a lot of times we don't realize
[29:11] that our identity is truly with the
[29:16] sacrifice that makes you what you are
[29:19] when your life is
[29:21] identified by your sacrifice
[29:25] amen the blood was a token or an
[29:29] identification the blood identified the
[29:32] worshipper had slain the lamb and
[29:35] accepted the lamb and applied the token
[29:38] to himself and he was not ashamed he did
[29:42] not care who saw it he wanted everybody
[29:45] to see it it was in a POS uh in such a
[29:50] position that everybody passing could
[29:52] see the token
[29:55] my see many people want want to be
[29:58] Christians and they they like to do it
[30:01] in secret so nobody would know that they
[30:04] were
[30:06] Christians the associates around them
[30:09] with some of them what some of them
[30:11] would think well now look I want to be a
[30:14] Christian but I don't want soand so to
[30:16] know about it well now you see that's
[30:19] not
[30:20] Christianity Christianity has to display
[30:23] its token see it's a public a public
[30:26] life at the office on the street when
[30:31] trouble is around anything in the church
[30:36] wherever wherever else the blood is the
[30:39] token and the token must be
[30:42] applied if it isn't or it's not even the
[30:47] the Covenant is not in effect my the
[30:51] blood has a token or an identification
[30:54] identifying this person has been
[30:57] redeemed
[30:59] my think about it they were there in the
[31:02] Old Testament and they came to a place
[31:04] where the prophet of God now said okay
[31:07] now we're coming to a time where you're
[31:09] going to have to get this lamb and
[31:10] you're going to have to slay it it
[31:13] wasn't just an ordinary lamb but that
[31:16] there was a certain Criterium and they
[31:19] couldn't just not put their hands on
[31:22] their
[31:23] sacrifice you you know it's it's one of
[31:25] those things that it was going to be a
[31:27] little bit of a mess
[31:29] there was going to be some blood on your
[31:31] hands and then you had to take that
[31:33] blood and you had to apply it to the
[31:36] door it's like a paint there was going
[31:38] to be something that every single person
[31:41] passing by that would know that there
[31:44] was something that died that somebody
[31:47] said this this thing that I'm doing is
[31:51] because I'm guilty I know I've crossed
[31:54] God's law I know that I'm not right but
[31:57] I'm not a shame because I've come God's
[32:00] provided way I know that there was a
[32:02] sacrifice that God's provided and I'm
[32:05] not a be ashamed to be identified with
[32:08] it it's on full
[32:10] display my and this is just the natural
[32:16] type but if that blood was not applied
[32:19] it they could be standing there and they
[32:21] can be around it they can be believing
[32:23] they were true Jews they could be
[32:26] Israelites they could be believing in
[32:28] Jehovah keeping the law they could have
[32:30] been circumcised on the eighth day they
[32:32] could have been at holding to the word
[32:34] of God to a complete full manifestation
[32:38] of everything that was said they were
[32:40] keeping it but when Moses came and he
[32:42] said now there's going to be a lamb that
[32:44] was slave now you're going to have to
[32:47] take hosf and you're going to have to
[32:49] take the blood and put it on the lentil
[32:51] and the post it could not just be uh uh
[32:55] reasoned away say wait wait I'm a
[32:57] Believer I believe the word of God but
[33:00] from that time if they couldn't do or
[33:03] didn't humble themselves to be
[33:05] identified with this this sacrifice this
[33:09] way of worship no you know I I believe
[33:13] in Jesus but you you're talking about a
[33:16] prophet that's coming this day well we
[33:18] don't need prophets no more we don't
[33:21] believe in speaking in Tong we don't
[33:23] believe in the Holy Ghost my just think
[33:26] about our day amen
[33:28] there's all kinds of voices there's
[33:30] different people have ideas but praise
[33:32] God we're going to let go of our own
[33:34] ideas we're going to look to the word of
[33:36] God and we're going to see the example
[33:38] given to us amen this is representative
[33:43] of the person who has been redeemed now
[33:45] well notice they
[33:48] had they were redeemed before anything
[33:51] ever happened by faith they applied the
[33:53] blood see before it actually happened
[33:56] the blood was supplied by faith
[33:59] believing that it was going to happen
[34:01] before the wrath of God passed through
[34:04] the land the blood had to be applied
[34:07] first it was too late after the Wrath
[34:10] had done
[34:12] Fallen my now there's a lesson that we
[34:15] could really maybe uh uh take a thought
[34:19] but just for a moment but look before it
[34:22] happens there is coming a time that when
[34:25] you will not be able to to apply that
[34:28] blood amen my I'm just I'm just speaking
[34:32] from my heart this this uh the Lord
[34:35] directed me to this because I began to
[34:37] realize just like as brother Billy was
[34:39] ministering like you know we get to a a
[34:42] time where we build things like we
[34:44] schedule things we have work we have
[34:47] family life we have work life we have
[34:49] church life we have all these things
[34:51] that we're doing and and I just said
[34:53] wait a minute this Christianity that God
[34:56] sent in this last day is supposed to be
[34:58] manifested as a life and it and it can't
[35:01] be hidden th this light can't be put
[35:04] over a bushel it's supposed to shine out
[35:07] amen we can't not let this word that God
[35:11] is speaking to our hearts just not be
[35:15] applied in our everyday
[35:18] living you know I I just I'll stop here
[35:20] for a minute and just forgive me for a
[35:23] minute
[35:24] I'm ah this is
[35:28] I'm a two- water guy one on the right
[35:30] one on the
[35:32] left but praise the Lord you know I
[35:35] thank God that we serve a living God I
[35:38] thank God that when God gives you the
[35:41] Holy Ghost he gives you something that
[35:43] changes situations amen and and I just
[35:47] tell you I'm so thankful what God did
[35:50] for our sister Genie I am so grateful
[35:53] just in a short period of time I mean
[35:56] the enemy he showed his bluff he put his
[35:59] head up but you know what he put it
[36:01] around Sons and Daughters of God and he
[36:04] stuck his neck out a little bit too
[36:07] far and God showed up on the
[36:10] scene because he's here to prove himself
[36:14] once again to his children you know you
[36:18] you you make your stand for me and I'll
[36:20] stand for you you know and that's what
[36:22] this was it it was
[36:24] before they did it by faith they applied
[36:27] the blood before any destruction fell
[36:31] and that's where we're at before the
[36:32] bombs fall before all this chaos ues we
[36:36] must apply the
[36:38] token what does that mean apply the
[36:41] token what does it mean identified with
[36:44] your
[36:45] sacrifice amen but as we're reading here
[36:48] it says it it identified that this
[36:50] person is redeemed amen and as we take
[36:53] communion tonight and we have communion
[36:56] and foot washing I just was God was
[36:59] dealing with me about what it really
[37:00] means to apply the token what brother
[37:03] brandham was saying and so as I got into
[37:05] it I said my Lord just speak to me amen
[37:10] and so as we go through this maybe open
[37:12] some more of it up to us amen he says
[37:14] this in 73 he says now the lamb was
[37:17] killed in the evening time after being
[37:19] kept up for 14 days and then the lamb
[37:23] has killed and the blood was applied in
[37:24] the evening time you get it the token C
[37:28] never came into existence until the
[37:30] evening time
[37:33] my and if we can go over to
[37:36] uh 137 it says this he says but when I
[37:40] see the token I'll pass over you it's
[37:44] God's requirement of this hour the
[37:47] evening time message is to apply the
[37:51] token amen and that's if I had a title I
[37:54] would probably say that God's
[37:56] requirement of this
[37:58] hour you know and for a subject just to
[38:03] apply the token we want to apply the
[38:06] token
[38:09] amen but I got to thinking and you know
[38:12] how how do we apply this token you
[38:17] know and I thought in John chapter 15
[38:21] this is um if you'll turn with me there
[38:25] John chapter 15
[38:29] you know if if we can see a promise in
[38:31] God then then we can walk into it
[38:35] amen it says this in John 15 and
[38:39] verse
[38:42] 20 John 15 verse 20 he says remember the
[38:47] word that I said unto
[38:52] you has has the Lord ever said anything
[38:55] unto you h as Believers we should be
[38:59] remembering what the Lord has said unto
[39:01] us I I don't I think that there's things
[39:04] that we remember other people said to us
[39:06] and it hurt our feelings it made us feel
[39:09] insecure it kind of questioned our
[39:10] identity do I have the Holy Ghost do I
[39:13] have this do I really have what God has
[39:16] has said that I have but he says now
[39:19] remember the word that I said unto you
[39:24] amen or I could just stop down there but
[39:26] it just
[39:27] remember the words that the Lord spoke
[39:29] to you because you can always go back to
[39:32] it it can be strength it can be food it
[39:35] can be
[39:39] help the servant is not greater than his
[39:42] Lord if they have persecuted me they
[39:45] will pers also persecute you if they
[39:48] have kept my Saints they will keep yours
[39:54] also we'll drop down there to 26 but he
[39:57] says but when the comforter is
[40:00] come when I will send unto you whom I
[40:04] will send unto you from the father even
[40:08] the spirit of Truth which proceedeth
[40:11] from the father he shall testify of
[40:15] me and ye also shall bear witness
[40:20] because ye have been with me from the
[40:23] beginning and I just thought how special
[40:26] that was if you can accept it tonight I
[40:29] I have accepted it in my heart and this
[40:32] token life God also wants to Bear
[40:35] witness in your
[40:37] life so he promised that he was going to
[40:39] send the
[40:40] comforter amen and he was going to it
[40:43] was going to be the spirit of Truth The
[40:46] Very life of Jesus Christ and you now
[40:49] are going to also bear
[40:53] witness you are the
[40:55] representation that God is going to Bear
[40:58] witness of the spirit of
[41:02] Truth
[41:06] my you know when brother brandham opened
[41:08] up in this this um token message it's
[41:12] just so profound sometimes our minds
[41:15] just raised but we want a
[41:17] simple projection and a simple goal but
[41:21] in 42 he says now we don't just stand
[41:24] here to be seen nor come together to see
[41:27] the clothes we're wearing we come here
[41:30] for one thing he says to hear the word
[41:34] that's right the word coming to
[41:37] us see we want that cuz that's the only
[41:41] thing that's going to mean anything
[41:43] anything that's going to be
[41:45] substantial anything that's going to
[41:48] help
[41:49] us
[41:50] amen he says and
[41:56] then we're we're a dying people all
[41:59] human beings are headed towards
[42:02] eternity and then we've got this much
[42:06] time to make our
[42:07] decision which way we're headed
[42:10] to and the road is before us we can take
[42:15] either
[42:17] side the way that we
[42:19] choose
[42:21] amen now he says this in 44 he says but
[42:25] we remember that no matter matter what
[42:28] we do how successful we are in life
[42:33] without Christ we're totally
[42:35] lost so if he is if he is all that there
[42:41] is to look forward
[42:43] to then we would be most foolish people
[42:47] not to accept
[42:49] it to cherish
[42:52] it not only accept it but to do
[42:55] something greater than that that after
[42:58] you got it you don't take it and lay it
[43:01] on the Shelf you put it to use amen
[43:05] that's right that's my heart's desire is
[43:08] that this what God has done when he
[43:10] speaks to us we don't just lay it on the
[43:12] Shelf but God when he speaks to us he
[43:14] wants us to put it into action put it
[43:17] into use let that Faith go into action
[43:21] and he talks about that you know it's
[43:22] like a doctor giving you
[43:25] medicine my can you imagine imagine if
[43:27] you're sick and this medicine's proven
[43:29] to to to to take care of it and we just
[43:32] leave it on the
[43:34] Shelf my that's what that's what like
[43:37] when God gives us the Holy Ghost and he
[43:39] gives us his word and then we just carry
[43:41] on with the regular routine at work but
[43:43] that's to help give us the right Vision
[43:46] amen the right projection the right
[43:55] foundation now now the first thing
[43:59] token it a token is a
[44:03] sign a sign of a fair price
[44:08] paid a fair or a price a required price
[44:13] has been
[44:14] paid I remember when I was a Youngster
[44:17] we went to the video arcade games and
[44:19] you wouldd have to put the dollars in
[44:21] there because it didn't just take hoars
[44:23] you had to have what they call tokens
[44:26] and but it only only worked at that
[44:28] arcade so you had to kind of ponder hey
[44:31] I'm only going to spend this much I
[44:33] can't put a $5 bill in there because I'm
[44:35] not going to be here that
[44:38] long right you know and how many tokens
[44:41] of different things do we have we're not
[44:42] going to be here that long this token is
[44:45] the only thing that matters this is this
[44:48] is the life that we want to
[44:53] display oh
[44:55] my it's a sign of a price paid he says
[45:01] therefore if it has been if it would be
[45:04] a a wolf I'm sorry I
[45:10] jumped
[45:12] amen my
[45:14] goodness see now down there he was
[45:17] speaking and we are starting
[45:20] in God was saying to Israel the blood of
[45:24] the Lamb is a token to you
[45:27] Israel's slain lamb was Jehovah's
[45:31] required token it must be the blood God
[45:36] made a token and gave it to Israel and
[45:39] no other token will work it cannot be
[45:44] recognized that was the only way the
[45:47] only thing that God requires is the
[45:51] token he says when I see the blood I'll
[45:54] pass over you amen
[46:01] my just thinking the requirement that
[46:05] Jehovah had met see the blood was
[46:09] representative that this was God's
[46:11] requirement and it had been met the
[46:15] wrath of God had been satisfied but that
[46:17] was only
[46:19] substitutionary that was only
[46:22] temporary but it was speaking of
[46:24] something see the the an animal the
[46:27] Beast life it was a lower life form that
[46:31] couldn't come back upon the
[46:33] worshipper so he still had the same
[46:36] conscience he was still doing the same
[46:38] old things but he knew that that was
[46:41] God's provided way that when the death
[46:43] angel was going to
[46:45] pass that it wouldn't plague those in
[46:47] the house
[46:53] amen the blood was the token that the
[46:56] requ of Jehovah was met that it had been
[46:59] done the blood stood for the
[47:03] token and God said the day you eat
[47:06] thereof is the day you die and there was
[47:09] had been a substitutionary
[47:12] life for the believer God in Mercy
[47:17] accepted the substitute of the life of a
[47:19] defiled
[47:21] person when his CH child was defied
[47:25] defiled himself in sin and disbelieve
[47:27] the word then God rich in Mercy made a
[47:31] substitute and that was something had to
[47:34] die in its
[47:37] place
[47:44] my praise the Lord that God's provided a
[47:47] uh sacrifice amen now this
[47:51] says the believing worship worshipper
[47:54] was identified in his sacrifice by the
[47:57] token I don't I don't wish to say this
[48:01] for very long but he says the believer
[48:03] had to be identified with the sacrifice
[48:06] if it was a just a
[48:09] sacrifice made Somewhere Out There He
[48:12] gave it and he had to be identified
[48:15] frankly had to put his hands on it and
[48:17] be identified with the sacrifice then
[48:19] the blood was placed to where he could
[48:23] stand underneath it the blood was over
[48:27] him and that was a
[48:29] token that he had identified himself
[48:33] guilty and then prove an innocent that
[48:36] an innocent substitute took his
[48:42] place my I I tell you if the prophet
[48:45] didn't say it like that I would have
[48:47] never been able to look at what the
[48:49] token looked like sometimes we we I just
[48:53] I'm GNA say me sometimes I you get to a
[48:57] place where you forget how guilty you
[49:00] were before the blood actually was
[49:03] applied to your heart you know I I don't
[49:07] I don't remember because it's been it's
[49:10] like but God helped me to understand and
[49:12] remember how he dealt with my guilt like
[49:15] what did I used to do with my guilt I
[49:17] used to hide it I would I would hide it
[49:20] trying to hide it in success trying to
[49:22] hide it in uh the ability to know great
[49:25] wisdom or or or be funny or go out
[49:28] drinking or relationships or anything
[49:31] but praise God God has a token a blood
[49:35] that was shed that it can deal with our
[49:37] guilt and I'm not a I'm not ashamed to
[49:40] be identified with the cross amen that
[49:45] that represents that blood that was shed
[49:47] represents the forgiveness and I've been
[49:50] redeemed I was guilty of
[49:54] sin that's good
[50:01] praise God I'm identified with My
[50:04] Sacrifice I've identified myself
[50:08] guilty and he had proven it was a proven
[50:12] innocent substitute had taken my place
[50:16] oh maybe that's why I forgot about the
[50:18] guilt cuz I have a perfect lamb
[50:22] amen but it's a good reminder because
[50:25] you know if God took my guilt and he
[50:28] laid it on the cross he can do it for
[50:31] you he can do it for anybody amen if
[50:35] they'll be identified with this lamb
[50:37] amen and they'll Place their hands upon
[50:40] that Lamb's
[50:42] head
[50:45] amen what a beautiful picture oh a
[50:49] redeemed see Justice had been met the
[50:54] requirement of God's holy Justice
[50:57] had been
[50:58] met now I'll require your life and then
[51:03] when the the life had sinned then an
[51:06] innocent substitute took its
[51:09] place and it was blood Beast not an
[51:14] apple that ought to make the serpent
[51:17] seed so plain to
[51:19] everybody that it was the blood and that
[51:23] blood which could not come from fruit it
[51:26] come from an innocent substitute the
[51:28] life had gone out
[51:33] amen my to be connected with our
[51:36] sacrifice you know when we think about
[51:40] our Lord and how God when he saw the the
[51:45] Savior the
[51:47] Redeemer you know the lamb sacrifice
[51:50] there's nothing so innocent as a
[51:55] lamb and when we look at the the lamb
[51:58] nature it it was to be led amen and then
[52:03] when God he he placed such a uh like a
[52:09] just a beautiful picture when the Dove
[52:12] came down on the lamb at his baptism you
[52:15] know and brother Brandon goes through
[52:17] and he starts saying about our nature
[52:20] you know there's a nature on the inside
[52:22] that we need to be reunited with you
[52:25] know our first birth
[52:27] it's like a goat nature it pushes back
[52:31] ah I want my own way I want to do my own
[52:33] thing but there's something on the
[52:35] inside that's a
[52:37] compatibility with that Dove amen am but
[52:40] we had to
[52:41] fight we have to bring this thing under
[52:44] the token we have to say God he took my
[52:48] guilt I don't have to continue in
[52:52] this I can claim the blood
[52:56] what a wonderful picture
[53:00] amen says what a perfect type of Christ
[53:05] just exactly the believer today standing
[53:09] under the shed blood identified with the
[53:12] sacrifice just as perfect as he can be
[53:16] oh my I like that so much and it's not
[53:19] our Perfection it's his amen
[53:29] praise the
[53:38] Lord you know it's just so wonderful he
[53:42] says this he says and then the dove led
[53:45] the lamb and notice the lamb to the
[53:50] slaughter now the lamb was obedient to
[53:52] the dove so no matter where it led it
[53:56] it was willing to
[53:58] go and I wonder today when God leads us
[54:02] to a complete a life complete
[54:04] surrendered and service to
[54:07] him I wonder if our Spirits then
[54:11] sometimes don't
[54:12] Rebel kind of showing that wonder if we
[54:16] are lamb see a lamb is obedient a lamb
[54:20] is self-sacrificial it doesn't take and
[54:24] claim its own can lay it right down and
[54:27] Shear its wool off that's the only thing
[54:29] it's got it never says anything about it
[54:33] it just sacrifices everything that's God
[54:36] that's a lamb it gives
[54:39] everything it gives everything
[54:42] away itself and all it is amen I thank
[54:48] God that God said that he was going to
[54:50] witness amen that was going to be we
[54:54] were going to Bear witness of this very
[54:57] thing what he is you are amen amen so if
[55:01] he has this lamb nature that's already
[55:05] been displayed you also are going to
[55:08] Bear witness of it because God's power
[55:12] of transformation because what he said
[55:14] he's going to
[55:16] do and you can hold that in your heart
[55:19] you can keep it on your mind you can
[55:22] apply your heart to this wisdom
[55:29] I say help me Lord I realize in me I
[55:33] just I'm not doing all of this but
[55:35] praise God the message came so that we
[55:37] can apply the
[55:43] token now this was a perfect lamb amen
[55:48] Christ the token that we are dead to
[55:52] ourselves and identified with our
[55:54] sacrifice then the lamb L and the blood
[55:57] of that person comes identifying
[56:00] together the sacrifice and the believer
[56:03] see you are identified your life by your
[56:07] sacrifice and that makes who you are
[56:12] amen praise the
[56:20] lord well I wasn't going to come up here
[56:22] with any notes and I was going to use
[56:24] this thing that I had used this thing in
[56:25] four years so this is not working for
[56:28] me but praise the
[56:33] Lord you know and maybe if we could just
[56:37] look right here on 77 he
[56:41] says uh 76 let's just back up a little
[56:44] bit but but it could not come upon a
[56:47] human being because animal life does not
[56:49] have a soul and the animal doesn't know
[56:53] that he is naked he just he doesn't real
[56:56] realize sin he know none so therefore
[56:59] it's a living being but not a living
[57:03] Soul therefore that animal could not
[57:06] come upon a human being because it don't
[57:09] have a soul in the life now there is a
[57:14] life a blood a life a soul in the life
[57:18] the soul is the nature of the
[57:21] life therefore it is no certain nature
[57:25] it's an animal therefore the blood stood
[57:27] for a token that the life had been
[57:30] given but in this glorious place under
[57:34] this Covenant there's no difference
[57:36] between the blood and the life the token
[57:38] for the believer today is the Holy Ghost
[57:41] not a blood a chemistry but it is the
[57:45] holy spirit of God that is the token
[57:48] that God requires of the church today
[57:51] God must see the token he must see it in
[57:55] every one of us
[57:57] amen the you know the death Angels
[57:59] coming and that was part of the Third
[58:01] Exodus right in this Exodus like there's
[58:06] you know a coldness in the church coming
[58:09] but by faith we want to apply just even
[58:12] like what was ministered this morning I
[58:13] say God let me tear down all of the
[58:16] walls that I've been building on other
[58:18] foundations and let me just revisit and
[58:21] come back to the sh Foundation
[58:30] amen excuse
[58:36] me says this he says now therefore
[58:39] living in the shadows the Wrath ready to
[58:41] strike God is requiring a token that you
[58:46] yourself received his token the Holy
[58:49] Ghost and that's the only way the only
[58:52] sign that God ever will pass because it
[58:55] is the literal life of Jesus returning
[58:58] back into the
[59:00] believer my there's no gray area
[59:03] there that's right that's the very Life
[59:06] of Christ that's pushing out in you why
[59:09] do you hunger why do you
[59:12] thirst what is that pushing you that's
[59:16] the life of Christ and he's saying I
[59:17] want to be on
[59:20] display praise God that's what communion
[59:23] is about remembering our sacrifice
[59:26] it's a perfect sacrifice Amen to bring
[59:29] you into
[59:32] Perfection and now how can there be any
[59:34] more perfect sacrifice than God himself
[59:37] becoming the atonement himself when God
[59:40] was made flesh in his own creative blood
[59:44] that it the only way that life the life
[59:48] of God could ever come back because all
[59:51] of us were born by sex
[59:54] therefore the life that is the life
[59:59] therefore the life that's in there is of
[1:00:03] the world and that life will not
[1:00:07] stand it's the thing that's already been
[1:00:10] judged and
[1:00:11] condemned it can't patch it up there's
[1:00:14] no way to patch it up there's no way to
[1:00:16] smooth it out there's no way to make it
[1:00:19] better it's got to die and that's the
[1:00:21] only requirement there is it's got to
[1:00:24] die
[1:00:26] and the
[1:00:27] substitute a Life of Christ Jesus Christ
[1:00:31] has come into you which is the Holy
[1:00:35] Spirit the Holy Ghost God's token that
[1:00:38] you have accepted the blood of his son
[1:00:42] Jesus Christ amen praise God for that
[1:00:45] because my you know the good thing about
[1:00:48] applying the blood and having the token
[1:00:52] life on display it gives you a
[1:00:54] confidence yes
[1:00:57] like as brother Billy was stating
[1:00:59] there's certain things that we do that
[1:01:00] we build on it it's shaky it's there's
[1:01:03] no confidence but this brings a certain
[1:01:06] satisfaction and an
[1:01:08] assurance amen that the the death angel
[1:01:12] it can come but I I've I've identified
[1:01:15] myself with the cross of Calvary with
[1:01:18] Jesus Christ the perfect lamb amen and
[1:01:21] it's no longer I that liveth amen but
[1:01:24] it's Christ in me
[1:01:28] 96 it says it has to be because a woman
[1:01:33] and her husband become one they become
[1:01:36] one and so does the Bride In Christ
[1:01:38] become one the ministry of the bride and
[1:01:41] the ministry of Christ is the
[1:01:44] same remember the former tretis o
[1:01:48] theopus that I wrote unto you that Jesus
[1:01:52] being began to do and continue to do his
[1:01:55] death didn't stop him no sir he returned
[1:01:58] again not a third person but the same
[1:02:00] person returned again in the form of the
[1:02:02] Holy Ghost to continue the work and
[1:02:04] continue on said the books of Acts Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:02:10] forever amen praise the Lord boy I tell
[1:02:15] you when I when I have loved ones and
[1:02:18] and I just testify I had a a loved one
[1:02:21] who was in the hospital and they said
[1:02:22] that she had a brain tumor and there you
[1:02:24] know she was blind and
[1:02:26] you know they were they like we're going
[1:02:29] to have to operate and we don't know
[1:02:30] what's going to happen and you know just
[1:02:34] God dealing with your heart praise God
[1:02:36] that God deals with our heart and we we
[1:02:38] have a hunger to see the supernatural we
[1:02:41] we need we need God to come on this
[1:02:43] scene for our loved ones and I just
[1:02:45] there and I I just believe the word I
[1:02:46] take what I know is is the word of God
[1:02:49] and I had a little piece of a
[1:02:51] handkerchief and I started talking to
[1:02:53] her I said you know why do you want to
[1:02:54] be healed do you want to serve God you
[1:02:55] want to she's just like yeah you know I
[1:02:58] Want to Be Free I'll serve God I believe
[1:03:00] and I just laid that handkerchief on her
[1:03:02] and I prayed and I had an assurance
[1:03:03] there's something in my heart that just
[1:03:05] believe God was on the scene that it
[1:03:07] wasn't me doing it cuz his word said to
[1:03:09] do it and so I applied that to my life
[1:03:12] and you know what we got results she
[1:03:14] never had to have the surgery she went
[1:03:16] on to have a family her life wasn't
[1:03:19] finished and snuffed out right there
[1:03:20] because somebody applied the token
[1:03:22] somebody believed the word of God and
[1:03:24] put it into action that's that's what we
[1:03:26] want to do tonight we want to see God
[1:03:28] moving on the scene for our loved ones
[1:03:30] God has given us the instruction we want
[1:03:32] to take it to heart we want Christ to
[1:03:34] rise up and Inspire Us by the love of
[1:03:36] God to see the faith of God move us out
[1:03:39] of these routines out of these
[1:03:41] traditions we want to get excited about
[1:03:44] what God's doing in our personal life
[1:03:46] not just in a church service
[1:04:05] yeah W praise the
[1:04:08] Lord I love this Paul said and this is
[1:04:11] in 135 he said Paul said I though I give
[1:04:14] my body to be burned as a sacrifice I
[1:04:17] give all my goods to feed the poor and I
[1:04:19] have not and I have faith to move
[1:04:21] mountains and so speak with tongues as
[1:04:24] men as angels and all the these other
[1:04:26] things I have nothing until the token
[1:04:29] has been applied until this
[1:04:32] token that's what I'm speaking of
[1:04:35] tonight the
[1:04:36] love now until this has been applied I
[1:04:40] am
[1:04:41] nothing my to think that that token is
[1:04:45] the love of
[1:04:47] God I can't tell you how many times when
[1:04:50] there's a desperate cry and I don't even
[1:04:53] look at whether the person's a believer
[1:04:55] or not you know it's I'm looking on the
[1:04:59] inside amen that's where we want to look
[1:05:04] one of these days if you don't know it
[1:05:06] now one of these days you're going to
[1:05:07] realize there's God on the
[1:05:16] Inside
[1:05:21] Man 149
[1:05:24] says see what I mean see the scriptures
[1:05:26] is speaking of here if the token was not
[1:05:29] displayed the Covenant was not in effect
[1:05:32] see it must be because if you you say
[1:05:35] you're a Believer and don't follow the
[1:05:37] instructions of the word you don't
[1:05:39] believe see though you be circumcised
[1:05:43] though you join though you are baptized
[1:05:46] you've done all these things like that
[1:05:49] it's still ain't the token the Holy
[1:05:51] Ghost my
[1:06:02] well just it's it's just time to check
[1:06:04] up you know I just for me personally I
[1:06:07] was looking at it I'm like my when when
[1:06:09] I think about applying my heart to
[1:06:11] wisdom I got to thinking about what it
[1:06:14] says in James you know James said I
[1:06:16] believe it's in chapter one in verse 26
[1:06:20] and 27 but like our religion is in vain
[1:06:23] if we're not visiting the Widow and the
[1:06:25] father Liv I mean there's certain things
[1:06:27] that like when the love of Christ
[1:06:29] strikes your heart you're not concerned
[1:06:32] about your life and I I had to I just
[1:06:35] examine myself you know we're human we
[1:06:38] we get busy we get doing stuff and
[1:06:41] that's why I say just like what was
[1:06:42] preached this morning God let me apply
[1:06:46] the token let me apply the token to my
[1:06:48] heart because I know that it'll do for
[1:06:50] me what you said it would
[1:06:56] and to think about the how that that
[1:06:58] message came at the evening time and
[1:07:01] maybe if we can get to it I'll just try
[1:07:03] to turn this corner but he says this he
[1:07:06] says in 187 the message of the hour is a
[1:07:10] sign to the
[1:07:11] church the sign to the people are you
[1:07:14] catching it I hope on the tape you're
[1:07:16] going to do the same thing see other
[1:07:19] parts of the world it's a sign is here
[1:07:22] there is a token and it's got to be
[1:07:23] applied no other time time could it have
[1:07:26] been notice God's preparation for that
[1:07:29] time now as we know that the Bible said
[1:07:33] that those things are happenings for
[1:07:35] examples you see notice when God was
[1:07:38] ready to judge Egypt first he made
[1:07:42] preparation what did he do at the first
[1:07:46] and he never changes his
[1:07:49] order the first time when he got he made
[1:07:53] his preparation he sent a prophet with a
[1:07:55] message first thing he done to his
[1:07:58] people was send a prophet with a message
[1:08:01] amen and the next thing he done he
[1:08:04] identified the prophet and sent a pillar
[1:08:07] of fire for identification to identify
[1:08:09] it and the third thing he sent was the
[1:08:12] token and that's exactly right the token
[1:08:16] what did the token mean
[1:08:19] Assurance praise God we're a people that
[1:08:22] we're sure we're certain
[1:08:25] this was not a man that made that
[1:08:28] picture he testified George J Lacy
[1:08:33] testified the light struck the
[1:08:35] lens this should
[1:08:37] bring this reality that God is fixing to
[1:08:41] send the judgment on the Land There is a
[1:08:44] spiritual death that is creeping on the
[1:08:48] land we must apply the token amen but
[1:08:52] this token meant Assurance amen he says
[1:08:56] in 194 he says now look just to believe
[1:08:58] is not enough not to walk around
[1:09:01] it isn't
[1:09:04] enough you make yourself worse for to
[1:09:07] know to do good and doeth it not to him
[1:09:09] is sin see the borderline Believers
[1:09:12] Jesus spake in the same
[1:09:15] thing my
[1:09:17] goodness but it says this in 203 says
[1:09:21] but we must have the token do you hear
[1:09:24] BR Brandon Tabernacle you must display
[1:09:28] the token and without it all you're
[1:09:30] believing is in vain see a good you can
[1:09:33] live a good life listen to the word and
[1:09:35] go to church and try to live right
[1:09:38] that's fine but that's not it see when I
[1:09:41] see the blood that is the token and the
[1:09:44] token here is not because it's the the
[1:09:47] actual chemistry because the life is
[1:09:50] gone he had gone from it it was an
[1:09:53] animal but here it is
[1:09:55] his own life that is in the blood and
[1:09:58] the chemistry was a signal or a sign of
[1:10:02] sanctification but the life itself is
[1:10:04] the token and without the circumcision
[1:10:07] without the token it's not the covenant
[1:10:10] not even in the Covenant the whole thing
[1:10:12] works together and if you if you say
[1:10:15] you're circumcised to the word and it's
[1:10:18] the only and you believe the word if you
[1:10:20] believe the word then the token has got
[1:10:23] to come see he said repent and be
[1:10:25] baptized every one of you for the
[1:10:27] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:10:29] receive the Holy Ghost there you are
[1:10:32] amen I thank God for the preparation
[1:10:35] that God made sending the message
[1:10:37] vindicating it with his presence the
[1:10:39] pillar of fire and it brings an
[1:10:41] assurance amen and if we don't have that
[1:10:44] Assurance tonight I just we'll read on a
[1:10:47] little bit more because brother brandham
[1:10:49] gives us the application how do we apply
[1:10:52] the
[1:10:53] token are you interested I'm interested
[1:10:56] I want to I want to apply this token I
[1:10:58] want to be identified with My Sacrifice
[1:11:01] the victories I had yesterday were great
[1:11:03] praise God but I got a victory
[1:11:06] today I'm looking for God to give me
[1:11:08] vision and food so that I can strengthen
[1:11:10] myself for the battle in front of me the
[1:11:13] Devil he's still out prowling he's
[1:11:17] trying to bring spiritual coldness
[1:11:19] amongst us as individuals but praise God
[1:11:22] God's given us a message Hallelujah
[1:11:29] 222 he says um or 221 let's then the
[1:11:33] prophet said I have heard from God there
[1:11:35] will be a token and you put the blood
[1:11:38] upon the door slay the lamb put the
[1:11:40] blood upon the door and it'll be a token
[1:11:43] because death is fixing the strike let
[1:11:46] me tell you today as a servant unless
[1:11:48] the token is on the door there is a
[1:11:50] spiritual death going to strike and all
[1:11:52] the churches are headed back to the
[1:11:54] council the world Council of churches
[1:11:56] they're all going back to
[1:11:58] Catholicism amen and the only those who
[1:12:02] are genuine Born Again are going to stay

[1:13:12] let me be an example of examples let me
[1:13:15] show to the world that
[1:13:18] this word is
[1:13:22] Christ the only way I can do it is to
[1:13:25] come into him CU I can't do it myself
[1:13:29] you can't do it but let the word and you
[1:13:33] become one then it lives itself out you

[1:19:16] 381 it says this apply the token then
[1:19:19] serve the Living
[1:19:21] God I think that's great instruction you
[1:19:24] know I think that God put us in a
[1:19:28] position where he's leading us because
[1:19:30] there's a desire in our heart you know
[1:19:33] like David said you know I thirst for
[1:19:36] the Living God we're not looking for
[1:19:39] something that's dead and something
[1:19:41] that's far away but some new land I I I
[1:19:45] know for myself part of the vision of
[1:19:47] what I'm Desiring is it's not just about
[1:19:51] what where I've experienced God in the
[1:19:53] past but you know sometimes when you go
[1:19:56] out into another realm of life and God
[1:19:59] wants to pull you into you're kind of
[1:20:01] uncomfortable things kind of feel shaky
[1:20:04] you're kind of not really certain about
[1:20:06] what's next but you're certain of God
[1:20:09] yeah but if we'll just apply the token
[1:20:12] and say God I'm going to trust you if I
[1:20:15] do this with confidence you might
[1:20:17] actually cause me to be on the Forefront
[1:20:19] of the battle and also I'm going to be
[1:20:22] there with the reality is is that I have
[1:20:25] a blood atonement I have that sacrifice
[1:20:28] that I've applied to my heart and I know
[1:20:30] that he's redeemed me and that he's
[1:20:32] doing this work amen that's what I
[1:20:35] believe that in my heart is craving for
[1:20:38] is to serve the Living God in this
[1:20:41] manner for a living Works living signs
[1:20:46] signs that heal the sick that raise the
[1:20:49] dead that foretell things speak in

[1:21:10] we turn the service over to brother
[1:21:11] Billy I just wanted you to just kind of

[1:21:17] communion you know it says to remember
[1:21:20] you know the Lord and the sacrifice that
[1:21:22] he made and I just believe that as we do
[1:21:24] that we can claim our loved ones you
[1:21:26] know there's healing and communion but
[1:21:29] you can also apply that token with faith
[1:21:31] believing and watch how God doesn't just
[1:21:33] orchestrate circumstances when you go to
[1:21:36] claiming that god-given right amen amen
[1:21:38] Lord bless you as we turn the service
[1:21:41] over to brother Billy maybe we can all

[1:21:57] I like that song so much the there is a
[1:22:00] blood I I think that's is is a good
[1:22:03] reminder of what that blood really
[1:22:06] represents that we've been redeemed
[1:22:09] we've been freed from the guilt and the
[1:22:11] shame and we can go serving the Living
[1:22:13] God Amen why don't we bow our heads
[1:22:15] together our precious Lord what a
[1:22:19] privilege it is to know that we've
[1:22:22] passed from Death to life and we have
[1:22:24] have within us Lord the token that when
[1:22:27] the death angel is passing Lord we're
[1:22:30] safe Lord it gives us such a comfort and
[1:22:33] joy but father we don't want to just put

[1:26:58] had an access amen it's the blood that
[1:27:01] gives us the access amen and I love that
[1:27:04] it's to be put on display when the token
[1:27:07] is on display it shows that there's a
[1:27:09] work that took place here it shows that
[1:27:12] something a lamb has died in that
[1:27:14] household and that's what he wants us to
[1:27:16] do andam says a token which is the sign
[1:27:20] it says it provides security when
[1:27:22] there's blood there it means I'm not
[1:27:24] going to die it means my sins have been
[1:27:27] paid for it means I'm good amen it means
[1:27:30] that I belong to somebody it it means
[1:27:34] ownership it means that this one is
[1:27:35] being taken care of and I just want to
[1:27:38] say this as our brother was speaking I I
[1:27:40] just think the devil so many times he
[1:27:43] wants to keep our eyes on ourselves
[1:27:45] where if we're not careful we become
[1:27:47] Catholics you know oh Father I've done
[1:27:50] wrong and father I've done wrong no he
[1:27:52] saved you he wants you to go out there
[1:27:54] and do some
[1:27:56] work yeah he wants us to go to battle
[1:27:59] well if you get wounded he'll take care
[1:28:01] of you you know otherwise we're just
[1:28:04] going to oh Lord I I sin again oh Father
[1:28:07] I confess my no he doesn't want us to be
[1:28:09] that way he wants us to be Sons and
[1:28:11] Daughters once a son you cannot change
[1:28:15] you're not there's not enough sin to
[1:28:17] change you from a son to a servant you
[1:28:19] are a son you are in a son
[1:28:22] forever amen I just feel and as our
[1:28:25] brother was talking and and that's why
[1:28:27] you you bury the burdens of others you
[1:28:30] you're there because something has been
[1:28:32] done to you you want to do to others you
[1:28:34] want to see God move and and you not
[1:28:37] just satisfy in containing it because
[1:28:39] even this flesh cannot contain it you
[1:28:42] just want to speak out from the the
[1:28:44] mountain and shut it out so everybody
[1:28:46] will know that there's a living God and
[1:28:49] that's why we testify that's why when we
[1:28:51] meet somebody in need we say why because
[1:28:53] we believe the token has been applied
[1:28:56] that I have been taken care of God has
[1:28:58] taken care of me and I need to go out
[1:29:00] there and do the same and Proclaim that
[1:29:03] same message so others will hear
[1:29:06] amen man let's turn our Bibles for our
[1:29:09] communion scripture reading as the
[1:29:10] brothers will get ready let's turn to 1
[1:29:13] Corinthian 11 and chapter uh the the 23
[1:29:18] verse um
[1:29:30] says for I have received of the Lord
[1:29:31] that which I also deliver unto you that
[1:29:35] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:29:37] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[1:29:40] had given thanks he Breo it and said
[1:29:43] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:29:46] for you do this in remembrance of me and
[1:29:50] after the same manner he also took the
[1:29:52] cup and when he had stopped saying
[1:29:54] this cup is a new testony in my blood he
[1:29:58] said this do ye as often as ye drink it
[1:30:01] in remembrance of me for as often as ye
[1:30:05] eat this bread and drink this cup do Ye
[1:30:09] Ye do show the Lord's Mercy the Lord's
[1:30:12] death till I come wherefore whatsoever
[1:30:15] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:30:18] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:30:20] of the blood of the body and the blood
[1:30:22] of the Lord but let every man examine
[1:30:25] himself so let him eat of that bread and
[1:30:28] drink of that cup for he for he that
[1:30:32] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:30:35] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:30:38] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:30:40] caused many are weak and sickly among
[1:30:44] you and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:30:48] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:30:51] when we are judged we are chasten off
[1:30:54] the Lord that we should be we should not
[1:30:56] be condemned with the world wherefore
[1:30:58] Brethren when ye come together to eat
[1:31:01] Terry one for another and if any any man
[1:31:05] hunger let him eat at
[1:31:07] home that ye come not together unto
[1:31:10] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:31:13] order when I come
[1:31:16] man man don't forget the instruction so
[1:31:20] for these two rows just go around and
[1:31:22] you know come in the middle middle we
[1:31:24] want at least to come uh form two rows
[1:31:27] that you come to eat so that way it
[1:31:29] could go as quick as possible and then
[1:31:32] if you are between these two rows you

[1:46:59] going to start from verse
[1:47:02] one it said now before the Feast of the
[1:47:06] Passover when Jesus knew that isawa was
[1:47:10] come and that he should
[1:47:11] depart out of this world unto the father
[1:47:15] having loved his own which were in the
[1:47:17] world he loved them unto the end and
[1:47:20] supper being ended and the devil have
[1:47:23] put into the heart of Judas is car at
[1:47:25] Simon son Simon's son to betray him
[1:47:28] Jesus
[1:47:29] knowing that he had that the father had
[1:47:33] given all things unto his hand that he
[1:47:36] was come from God and he went to God I
[1:47:38] love that so he knew that he raised it
[1:47:42] from supper and laid aside His Garment
[1:47:45] and took a towel and GED himself and
[1:47:48] after he poured water into a basin and
[1:47:51] began to wash his disciples feet and
[1:47:54] wiped them with a towel wherewith it was
[1:47:57] GED then come to Simon Peter uh Simon
[1:48:02] Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does
[1:48:06] thou wash my feet Jesus answered and
[1:48:09] said unto him what I do that knoweth not
[1:48:13] now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter
[1:48:17] said unto him Thou shalt never wash my
[1:48:19] feet Jesus answered him if I wash the
[1:48:23] not thou has no part worth me Simon
[1:48:26] Peter said unto him Lord not my feet
[1:48:29] only but my but also my hands and my
[1:48:33] head Jesus said said to him he that is
[1:48:36] washed needeth not safe to wash his feet
[1:48:39] but is clean every with ye are clean but
[1:48:42] not all for he knew who should betray
[1:48:46] him therefore he said ye are not all
[1:48:49] clean so after he had washed their feet
[1:48:53] and and taken His Garment and sat down
[1:48:57] again and he said unto them know ye what
[1:49:00] I have done to you ye call me master and
[1:49:03] Lord and ye said well for sure I am if I
[1:49:07] then your Lord and Master have washed
