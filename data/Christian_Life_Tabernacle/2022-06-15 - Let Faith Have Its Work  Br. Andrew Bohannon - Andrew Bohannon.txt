praise god you believe he's all you need amen it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight i want to welcome everybody isn't it good to be a christian isn't it good to be hungry for the word of god there's a lot of people hungry for a lot of things but for the words of life the bread of life oh we're a special called out people it's good to be gathered together why don't we bow our hearts together precious heavenly father lord we thank you god that you've called us to yourself lord and here we are lord we have a divine promise lord lord and you said if we ask anything in your name that you would grant it and so father we pray that you would come and be the guest of honor tonight lord god we're very needy of you too lord reveal the secrets of our heart lord to come and dine with us and minister to our hearts lord as lord no doubt there's a lot of uncertainty in the world but lord we're certain that you've sent a vindicated message lord and you oh god just you continue to unfold your will in our lives lord and so we pray god that you would come and deal with each heart lord may you speak oh god and let me be just put to the side lord even for a little moment lord we're asking god that lord when we leave here lord that salvation was rod that healing was wrong the deliverance is lord that wisdom was imparted lord and that lord we would be leaving here better lord o god more in love with you lord more in service for your kingdom as we're committing all the people's needs to your hand desiring that you take full control of this service in the blessed wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we do pray amen praise god well if you have your bibles we'll go right to the word certainly appreciate that testimony and the testimonies uh um it's just a marvelous thing to think that someone who would be suffering in a trial for so many years and god so merciful to provide a way that you can feel your feet again praise god and even just thinking about how mindful he is even of the little things to to deal with our brother in such a special way isn't isn't that the way god does how many can testify here that's god's been personal to you amen praise god i'm thankful we serve a personal god amen well we won't keep you long we just trust that the things that the lord's put upon our heart will be a blessing to you and that we can enter into a little time of fellowship with the lord and if you want to open your bibles we're just going to take a little thought out of the gospel of luke in chapter 11. certainly been enjoying the the way the lord's been dealing with the ministry it's been a blessing to me we're going to read there in verse 33 of chapter 11. the scripture says no man when he had lit and lighted a candle put it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light amen you may have your sheets we trust the lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word yeah i just thought it's so special in the different gospels they referred to that scripture if you don't mind leaving it up on the board for a minute it just made me think about it today and i was thinking about when the lord put it on our brother benoit to share the things that the lord put on his heart and you know he read out of the quote about you know don't wait till your candles burn down or have burned down but go and tell them how it got lived amen isn't that wonderful you know and to think there was a man that lit that candle is there a man here tonight that if your candle is not lit you can light your candle amen isn't it wonderful that the word of god isn't just psychology where you can just take it and it can be a concept and that you can just grasp it and say well i i can agree with that but praise god there's a god that'll come behind it and make it live amen oh i'll tell you i'm i'm starting to get a little fired up because i see a saint here oh my that didn't have much hope and oh i remember the lord just put it on our hearts and i i could just tell you this is to the glory of god but a bag full of pills that the science only through science and and intellect of man that that was their only provided way to bring uh uh an answer to to a sick body to to to to bring some kind of uh healing virtue but praise god there was a living god on the scene the same god that's that's that's here tonight amen oh oh i'm just i i can't help but hardly even say it because i tell you you know the testimonies of god just bring you into his presence i i i have to say it i'm so i i was longing for the day to see brother jackson's mom and service hallelujah you know i seen her in a place of absolute despair she might not even remembered it but there was something in my heart that said i'll see her in church hey man you know when when uh the the vision of the people in the world they just they can only see so far but thank god there's a faith that god has brought in this end time that we can look beyond circumstance and we don't have to force god's hand to come and do it when we want it but god is sovereign god can move any time any place at any hour and he always moves according to his word amen praise be to god he's alive to do for you exceedingly and abundantly hallelujah praise god i'm grateful to see you sis praise god god is so wonderful he's got so much more for us hallelujah i'm looking for cody hey man oh hallelujah you just claim your you claim your promise brother jackson that's our promise we're not leaving one hoof behind hallelujah [Applause] god's word has a creative power when it's in a believer's heart and he's not fearful of what man can do amen he's not afraid of the yesterday he's not concerned about his tomorrow he's willing to give off in a life of full surrender say i might not be able to see it like i ought to but praise god my god is in my heart he started to work and he's faithful to finish it because that's his word amen even if god is just barely tugged on your heart to say you know what i want jesus to come and live in my heart hey that's enough oh god to start a fire of a flame to take you all the way to glory hallelujah we got witnesses here tonight you did it for me he'll do it for you [Applause] amen praise god we're uh we're thinking of a little thought that's on our heart to to let faith go to work amen god didn't just give us a fulfillment at the end time to see the word coming to flesh to to put seven angels in the cloud in the sky to vindicate his presence to give us a vision of a statue of a perfect man to vindicate himself that he's identified again with man he's not to be ashamed to be called our god and we want to let this revelation go to work we're not waiting for somebody else to do it what's my part the bible says these signs shall follow them that believe in my name there's no other name under heaven where man must be saved that's in the name of the lord jesus christ what a precious name to be able to to name the name of jesus oh my you think about how good it feels to name your name but oh when that jesus christ names your name after this is all said and done oh isn't that what we're living for enter into the joys of the lord that's been prepared for you before the foundation of the world amen amen you know something that praise god something that uh we're listening to why christ speak it it just put like a focal point and uh you know he says we're living we've lived the time out the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength to to that can change these bodies that we may live amen isn't that what we're looking for you know when god comes on the scene and you you have a need and it might be sickness it might be financial trouble might be relationships and yet you can place upon the altar your need to a god that can answer back it's not some fictitious something it's not some emotional concept but it's a god that cares that's right it's an on-time god amen now we're looking to let this faith go to work amen and the scripture says there in john 15 and in seven and eight it says if you abide in me and my word abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen and and it just it's it's amazing sometimes people you know they get to where they're thinking about something and they like you know think about what you like a subject you know if you like sports or if you like drama or if you like music you're constantly dwelling on it and sometimes you might even just be daydreaming or dreaming and you know but you're dwelling on it and the scripture is saying here if you abide in me amen you know there's there's a lot of thoughts that come that are contrary to god's promises for us but let's listen let's when when a man can take the faith the revelation of this hour and see that i can't i can't manifest until i hear it because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god so if i would consecrate myself to a time where i can let the word minister to my heart amen that way we can let that faith go to work amen praise god you know i was thinking about this scripture in james um james chapter 2 and in verse 14 you know we're thinking about how that you know we need to have rapturing faith and god's provided it in this end time because we're a people that are not set for destruction aren't you thankful there's a people that we the world bride they're heaping up their judgment they're making preparation for a tribulation praise god but aren't you grateful that there's rapturing faith in the in the word of god that'll take and it will you know it's an applied faith right it's not oh well i'm feeding on the messages i'm feeding on the messages and i think that's that's exactly where the the message we were just listening to why christ speak moses he knew because intellectually his mom told him say you were born a proper child you were born a deliverer it's been prophesied that after 400 years and you're the you're the one that had this certain uh birth and and god even by faith they they put him out on the the you know the the river and the water they didn't fear because it was by faith and so that that's that's what we want we want to apply the faith that's been been taught through this pulpit and that's taught through the word of god and the message we want to actually let it live go to work for us amen yes sir praise god see the predestinated now this is out of why christ speak he says see the predestinated seed is laying there and when the light struck it it come to life and you can't keep it down you can't hide it amen isn't that wonderful that there's seeds in the ground that when the light strikes it you can't hide it because it was ordained to come forth whatever the seed is is ordained to come forth amen so there's a people that are predestinated to eternal life you're predestinated to express the risen savior it doesn't matter if concrete was laying there you could see it doesn't matter if sickness was laying on that seed it doesn't matter if if genetics of family sin or history or whatever it doesn't matter that you were in dead and in bondage the predestinated seed had to come forth when the light crossed its path what happened it come forth now it shines and rises to the glory of god amen ain't that wonderful the life of christ praise me to god there's there's a hope of glory at this end time what is the hope of glory it's christ in you christ in me you say well what do you mean christ in me christ in you you know i got to thinking about you know there was a young man and you know i i you know he might not feel like he's uh amounted to much as far as christian but i saw god moving in him don't you love to see god moving in your brother and sister young or old middle-aged white black boy girl boy i just see the love to see the risen savior doing what he said there's something in my heart that says hey man praise god and he just you know the enemy tried to discourage him you know that's what that's what his job is is to bring an opposition to come in and to fight at you but praise god there's something in us that's greater amen he had a he had some opposition say well you know they treated me wrong i said well that's probably so that's probably right you know in life life's full of difficulties life's not fair there's a lot of things that can happen in life and you can't make sense of it and i just encourage them i said you know there's christ in you want to forgive them will you let him live will you let him go to work and he looked at me he's like well all right and i didn't i just left it there but praise god our god is alive and well and you know what i could stand back and i could say i seen christ in my brother he was willing to let go and let god is there somebody here tonight willing to let go and let god god is wanting to pour out his blessings upon our lives that's right sometimes there's little things that are holding us from receiving the eternal word of god and the word of life to resist wrecked us out of the condition that we're currently in god has a great tree that he wants to bear forth fruit he said abide in me and you can ask what you will that your fruit would remain that you'd be bearing much fruit well praise god who wants to be the the restored bride tree where somebody some passerby can come by take a little long suffering a little joy you you your little messiah you you individually every single one of you have creative power to create an atmosphere where the sinner can come in where the sick can come in where those who are discouraged those who don't have a hope those who are walking in darkness those who have no certainty you can say my god is able even now even now he can come and break those shackles he did it for me there's something here tonight called grace amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me praise god praise god when the light strikes the seed you know this word is not light until it's vindicated or brought to pass so when it's promised that at the end time there would be a people that would be called they god would not be ashamed to be called their god those who actually look to the word of god and worship the true and living god not a god of the past not far off but right now he's not ashamed to become their god hallelujah so when that light when that word is comes to pass like we see malachi 4 we see revelations 10 7. what does it do when it goes apart across your path you see i was in the word of god and god brought it to pass something on the inside begins to identify that there's something in here that that i believe that and what goes to work belief faith in the word of god and and all of a sudden now it's just like god did it then he's got something for me now do you believe that god has something for you right now god has something for us right now he's uniting us together in christian love in the faith that was once delivered to the saints he's bringing us to a restoration of faith that we can put it in action amen to where we can let the faith that's been given loose and go out to work amen isn't that wonderful there was somebody that was all bound up and we referred to her as the woman at the well and she came and it was her hour of quickening it was her hour to be brought to life and you know what on that visit it was just another day that's true wasn't it like that for you it was just another day of your life and you you didn't know that you were predestinated you didn't know that you were ordained to life you didn't know that he had precious promises for you you didn't know that he had a hair inheritance for you you didn't know that he had a family for you to come in and be a part of to minister to to be ministered to hallelujah to be able to be fruit-bearing [Music] to be able to be satisfied with life oh yeah you were looking here and there and everywhere but oh my when that light came across your path that's what happened with her she said we know that when the messiah comes he'll do these things but who are you i'm he oh my that sets something in her to working and then that discernment became to work him oh my he's the revealer of the thoughts and intents of the heart oh my when that light struck that seed something came something came forth what was it the resurrection brought that seed to life she said come see a man who told me all i've ever done oh oh that candle was lit who lit the candle she didn't light it you didn't light your candle god came to you in your dark hour god came to me no man lighted the candle and set it under a bushel so the work that god did when he lit us is to be on full display because it's the light away ain't that wonderful ye are the light of the world young people middle age olders god has a purpose that he wants to shine a light in your world there's people in your world that need to see the light of god at this end time a lot of people were pointing back to a jesus 2000 years ago but where is the dwelling place of the living god where is his voice where is the voice of the resurrection at the end time there's a people joshua and caleb they were given the promise of a land flowing with milk and honey and whenever they came and got divine fulfillment they seen the evidence of the land that it's real and no matter the opposition no matter the report of the the other 10 spies it says our god is more than able we're not trusting in our own works we're not trusting in our ability to know god is the one that brings revelation our job is to ask this is according to your word praise god in james chapter 2 it speaks about we'll just read it right here chapter 2 verse 14. you love the lord amen i love the word because it it brings a clear vision you know and you your life experiences and circumstances that you face today sometimes are trying to to to make your faith void but praise god god is here to make it live in that wonderful god is here to make your faith go to work to to to receive your inheritance and that others can see that god is not dead god is living and he's able to do according to his promises the scripture says what doeth that prophet my brother and though a man say you have faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say to him depart in peace be ye warm and filled notwithstanding you give him give them not those things which are needful to the body what doeth it profit even so faith if it hath not works it is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou ha thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i'll show you the my faith by my works thou believers that there is one god thou do us well the devils also believe in tremble but will thou o vain man that faith without works is dead amen was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see now how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god see then how that the works amen that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and sent them on their way but as the body without the spirit so faith without works is dead also you know and i just think about what why christ brother banham talking about how that we got moses moses was ordained to be the deliverer you know and he knew it from the intellectual side and there's a lot of promises that we know on the intellectual side and god uses that channel of intellect because it has to drop past the intellect because faith cometh by hearing but we wanted to sink past the intellect and come down where this faith can go to work amen because if we're just doing it then it's it can be undone and if god's gonna do it amen that's an eternal permanent work amen because we're not looking just to to soothe a temporary we we want to see that eternal work come to pass in our lives and the lives of our loved ones amen and so we just we think about moses and how you know he came to that place where you know he had that that intellect of trying to fulfill his purpose by intellect and you know that's the way we do that you know but we come to realize that that'll have to come to a failure because what good is it in a marriage if it's just one-sided right i mean one party's doing all the work like hey uh you know isn't it time for you to do this and that and the other well no this is a this is a uniting of the bride and the bridegroom you know god is so orchestrated this thing to where the works that i do shall you do also and moses got to the place where he realized that he was a failure in that way you know and that's where we come to you know we come to a place where our weakness we're made strong in weakness and it's no longer our excuses i can't talk yeah i stutter you know what whatever your excuse is but god has deposited a gift of faith amen that you can hear the word of god and you can look beyond the impossibility of man and see there's another resource of life amen praise god that your your special class of people that believe for the impossible even even as our brother orlando they're going out to virginia how many believe that god is going to touch that situation i believe it i believe that god wouldn't have brother orlando drive all the way that and do all of that and his word not come to pass how about in your life how about your situation you know if we just try to do it the way we think it needs to be done it'll come out of failure but if there's a need he said if you call upon the name of the lord you shall be saved and all power was given unto him and now where's the authority in the heart of the believers i see believers tonight that can be defense makers in their world if they'll let the faith go to work amen you know i it so blessed me when our pastor said you know sometimes we let the little things in life the bills and all of the responsibilities and the tax all this stuff it it makes it it brings like a littleness to our world but but when you have faith as a mustard seed you can move mountains and the enemies just trying to get us all huddled up in our own little world how the enemy has afflicted us and caused all this grief and yet we've been commissioned to bring satan's kingdom down you're more than a conqueror through christ jesus who loved us praise god we just need a personal contact and that's what moses needed moses knew intellectually that he was the deliverer he was the one ordained for the job but then when he had that personal meeting with the lord can you imagine how much of a wreck our lives were when we tried to do it without that personal meeting you know we end up slipping this way and slipping this way but he's ordained it that we would take his yoke upon us that would be you know that yoke is an interesting thing because it has the two and you're going at this thing together you know isn't it wonderful he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you even in you that's a great comfort to me sometimes you feel like you're going down roads all alone because you're not alone what a comforter see he this is i believe uh paragraph 48 he tried through his intellectual experience with the word he tried to bring them out and deliver them because he knew he was born for that purpose he knew that the time the scripture all said that he had already had 400 years just as we know now as a man asked a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture we know that we live the time out and the rapture is at hand we're looking for rapturing faith to pull the church together to give it some supernatural strength that'll change these bodies that we live in you know i was just the other day you know with this heat wave and you know you get little aches and pains you know you're working but praise god that god could give you a vision you know hey this is not my final destination you know i don't have to continue in this dread and this just you know because i know how pain can get i i suffered with pain for a very long time before i knew the lord and really met the lord and knew that his power was still the same that he can deliver and he can heal and that thing sometimes gives you narrow vision amen don't don't you realize that the enemy is trying to box us in and give us narrow vision try try to give us some kind of shiny something to chase after in the world you know what what's over there oh is that oh is that that's a new job oh there's advancement look at oh new home you know comes new car you know what comes with all that is more responsibility more headache more thinking about this world i'm ready to blast out of here let me say it this way i'm getting ready to blast out of here god is still working on the inside bringing himself to the outside isn't that your testimony jesus working on the inside coming to the outside that's our hope of glory it's christ in me when we see god that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life and present him before us when we see god who can take a cancer that ate a man to a shadow and raise him up strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing faith to the people well praise god i'm i am so glad to see you brother jackson's mom i tell you what there's something just it's wailing up in me it's years you you wait until you see if god puts a vision in your heart you hold to it you don't let nothing steal it away and see our schools of theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are all right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something amen isn't that what we're searching for more of is when the word comes to us and we say amen and we begin to testify of it amen you know what by his stripes you are healed that's right god has died to deliver you from that mental oppression god has paid the price that you can ask whatever you have need of you need a job god is a provider see moses based his great call upon the word and it was great until one day he met this light and the very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing that anointing what that anointed what he had in him and on the inside the intellects that believed it the faith that he based that was based upon his belief in god that separated him from his mother and now when he strikes in the presence of this light it anointed that that he believed see and the anointing and he was commissioned amen isn't it wonderful that god comes personally to you and we've heard testimonies and i just you know i thank god i could even give a testimony i i remember when the lord put on my heart and you know was fellowshipping with the brother that was dear to us known him for years and we were doing some work together and it wasn't a necessarily a believer at the time but you know we were doing a job together and you know i heard on tape that god was a provider and i heard that god still raises the dead and he does the impossible and it says something in my heart that now there was there was a faith starting to rise up and i remember you know one of the tools gave way and it was an air compressor and we were in the middle of the job you know we were in the middle of the job and i i just said you know what we can't you can't clean up shop and throw all these other products away because it still needs to be completed and so i went over there and laid hands on the compressor brother tommy's here to testify god allowed that compressor to go to work after won't work i never heard it do that it just died right on the scene but you know what something in his heart started bubbling you know if you've ever witnessed a miracle there's something in your heart that says there's something in my heart that i want to speak i want to pray the brother testified he took his hat off prayed what was that that was a personal meeting and god spoke back by giving him his heart's desire i love god for that that anointed what he had believed and he was commissioned praise god i won't keep you much longer praise god you know i tell you what the you know in nature brother branham talked about how nature was one of his bibles and you know he said that i noticed that you know in nature um when they had these certain animals they were feeding off a certain land that they'd actually begin to be identified with what they feed on you know like the certain uh lambs or sheeps they would um you know or excuse me there it was the um it was deer in a certain country they would eat this brown blue type of grass or whatever it was and all of a sudden they began to uh be like the same as what they were feeding on in a certain coyote in a desert land or whatever it was kind of feeding on some red foliage or something and then they would take on kind of the same identity of what they were feeding and i thank god that god sent a man in this area that would give us spiritual food in due season he wouldn't take and filter the word of god but our pastor would lead us to the message of the hour and he would take the word of god and break it to our hearts in its simplicity i i'm a benefic a beneficiary of someone who's laid his life down for this gospel praise be to god and and he's it's an example to me like you see brother branham he gave his life as an offering it was a living sacrifice and now it's a it's a testament it's a testimony of what i want to do it's what we want to do isn't it worth consecrating and dedicating and cutting away turning loose from not obligating ourselves to things in this world not becoming enamored not letting it draw us in but we want to make a clear-cut decision for me and my house we're going to serve the lord every situation amen you know brother branham makes this statement i i you know when he's when he saw when moses saw that he was a failure his faith kind of dropped back a little you know and just because you failed just because you've set out to do something for the lord and you knew you were called to it you know he said go into all the world preach the gospel and you know i've done i've made mistakes i've gone about it with the wrong approach haven't you done the same going out and just with the zeal of the lord ah you know we're just gonna convert the world but there's a predestinated seed as we grow we begin to refine our search as we're declaring the light of the gospel we take on the spirit of the word and we go and seek that's what was lost those that are on his great tally book the lamb's book of life amen want to have our faith to let our faith work for the promises amen see now god forgive me if this sounds sack religious i do not work on earth only through man i am divine yeah the branches and i only declare myself when i can find a man and i have chosen you and i am sending you down to take them out see i will be with your mouth amen you know sometimes you think that you know you have a desire to see your loved one saved you have a desire to see them prospering and be in good health well where did this come from this is this didn't originate in us it's god's will and good pleasure to give you the kingdom and he's given us a part in it he said speak the word and go forward it's your promise it's my promise praise god you know it was his testimony i met the lord you know if if we're going to go into all the world let's let that be our testimony i met the lord you know come come i want you to meet him you know if you had a really good friend and you just can't help but always want to be around them and you meet new friends you say help i want you to meet my friend come meet him amen sometimes we fail to tell others to come meet him but we want to let that faith go to work for others amen come see a man praise god you know i just we're just gonna wind up here just another maybe five minutes i don't mean to hold you you know the the great shining light this was in um show us the father preached in 1954. brother branham was talking about you know when faith was active and an old-fashioned meeting of testimonies and the power of god and the blessings we've seen so many testimonies in the power of god to set people free from the bondages to to to bring them into the kingdom to to set them free from sin and the bondage of sin to really begin to see sons and daughters expressing like our brother billy priest about the duty of expression you know isn't it wonderful you know when when you begin to see this this light that's shown across their path and now there's a resurrection oh my it just sets us to a greater expectation every service every service who's next where's the next resurrection where's where's the light going to shine forth to bring about the christ in your life amen says in verse 16 or in paragraph 16 he says if i could look tonight it's the holy ghost bubbling if i could look out tonight and look at the great morning star the evening star yonder what makes you shine evening star he'll come back and say it's not me shining brother branham it's the sun shining on me that's what's doing it we have a old-fashioned meeting more testimonies in the power of god it isn't the people that's shining it's the holy ghost from heaven shining on the people giving light to this dark world in the absence of the son of god hallelujah right that's right that's what we need tonight is an old-fashioned bubbling up meeting i used to go when i was a pastor at the milton baptist church i stayed with a friend called the rights i used to go in the night way down the hill and when i'd go out there an old nightingale or a mockingbird we call them dare used to set a little old cedar bush where it turned in down below the barn and go about a half a mile on the hill they're the woods to the place and this little old nightingale sat there he was just once in a while the clouds the cloudy night he'd wait a while then he would just sing a song to the top of his voice and i began to study what made him do that it's a cloudy night in this bird his brother bran was just studying it was like man this bird all of a sudden he just breaks out in a song just as loud as he could he said what made him do that he said he sits there and looks towards the heavens through the night and whenever he can see one star shining he starts singing and knows there's a sun shining somewhere amen that's that's that's what happens with you and me when we hear the testimonies of god dealing with these children that have set their eyes above leonicia and they've looked and seen that a god is able and has fulfilled his promise and then it sings something in their heart to the top of their lungs oh glory to god because he knew the sun was shining somewhere there's a living god somewhere on earth amen hallelujah the same holy ghost power raised them up on the day of pentecost give them the blessing of god the power is still in existence somewhere and when you can see the church that's getting that's together with god what a marvelous thing god in his universe praise god isn't that wonderful you know i just i'm just going to go ahead and ask you if you want to stand we'll just invite the musicians you know the the moses when he he was the next pharaoh and he was ordained to lead the children out and yet he had the opportunity presented to him you know it was is the glamour of egypt he could have had anything he wanted you know and with the gift of faith he made his choice he he he was identified with those what they call mud daubers but those were the people of god amen amen praise god this this message in why christ speak it says this in paragraph 134 he says they paralyze the little faith that they have and it can't work but moses gave way to that and he his faith paralyzed the world either your faith will paralyze glamour or either glamour will paralyze your faith now you have to take one or the other and you see the bible don't change god don't change and here's the unchangeable god why christ speak you know and i'll leave you with this you know there's there's things that we conceptualize what's what's good and what's right and and i i'll say this god i believe that he's four healings and and he's four even if someone doesn't have the same faith for the impossible and and and if there's a there's there's a faith that worketh by love in the believers today i remember just there was a need that came and this is a number of years ago but you know hearing the revealed word of the hour there's anything's possible with god and i remember hearing that one of my wife's cousins they were in a distressful situation and one of the cousins fell on christmas eve and went tumbling down the ladder or down the stairs and completely like broke the neck and was paralyzed and it was it was a devastating thing to the family and yet we just put it before the lord you know i don't know what god wants to do in that situation and you know they weren't living right it was two women that were you know they have an open life that is not what we would say is is christian it was you know uh but you know what god is willing to to declare because he's no respecter of persons and god's able to deliver of spirits of bondage and oppression and i just want to say that we went out there and we just had a burden to go out and see what god would do and you know what within a year we saw her at a family function totally walking as if nothing happened you know it's the goodness of god that brings a heart to repentance you see let's just approach this and let the faith go to work amen let the love of god that god loved you with be shed abroad to go out into this world and impact them for the gospel amen you love the lord praise god why don't we bow our hearts in our heads together and pray if i'd ask you tonight if if you want to just look to the lord and and ask him for a deeper sincerity or a deeper consecration to let the faith the gift of faith that god's placed in your life to go to work in your world to affect for the the kingdom of god and you want to just lift your hands tonight and ask believing that it makes a difference
