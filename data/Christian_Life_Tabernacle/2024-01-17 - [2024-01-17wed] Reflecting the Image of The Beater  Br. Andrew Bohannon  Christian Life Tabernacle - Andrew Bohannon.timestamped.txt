[36:37] the ark the testimony which I shall give
[36:41] thee and thou shall make a mercy seed of
[36:44] pure gold two cubits and a half shall be
[36:49] the length thereof and a cubit and a
[36:51] half of the breath thereof and thou
[36:53] shalt make two cherums of gold of beaten
[36:57] work Thou shalt make them in the two
[37:00] ends of the mercy seat and make one
[37:03] cherubin on the one end and on the other
[37:06] gerbon on the other end even of The
[37:10] Mercy
[37:11] Seat shall ye make the cherubims on the
[37:15] two ends
[37:20] thereof and the cherubims shall stretch
[37:23] forth their wings on high covering The
[37:26] Mercy Seat with their wings and their
[37:29] faces shall look one to another toward
[37:33] The Mercy Seat shall the faces of the

[37:49] with thee and I will commune with thee
[37:52] from Above The Mercy Seat from between
[37:55] the two cherubim which are upon the Ark
[37:58] of the testimony of all these things
[38:01] shall I give thee in commandment unto
[38:04] the children of Israel amen we also want
[38:07] to read in
[38:08] job and in job
[38:12] 23 you know I was just thinking about
[38:14] you know in trials and testings you
[38:17] definitely think about job and his
[38:20] patience and how he definitely um you
[38:23] know went through some trials and I know
[38:25] we're going through some trials amen
[38:27] you know just want to encourage your
[38:28] faith you know we're all going through
[38:30] some something and if you're not you
[38:32] might want to see if you're even you
[38:35] know put into the Battle of service yet
[38:37] you know it's just one of those things
[38:40] it's a guarantee as a Christian soon as
[38:42] you make your stand for God all the
[38:44] devil's guns are trained on you so we
[38:48] think it not strange but here in job 2
[38:51] uh3 it looks like we'll start there in
[38:54] uh verse 10 he saids says but ye know
[38:57] the way that I should take when he hath
[39:01] tried me I shall come forth as gold my
[39:05] foot hath held his step his ways I have
[39:10] kept and not declined neither have I
[39:12] gone back from the Commandment of his
[39:14] lips I have esteemed the words of his
[39:17] mouth more than my necessary food but he
[39:20] is in one mind and who can turn him and
[39:24] what his soul desires even that he doeth
[39:28] for he hath performed the thing that is
[39:31] appointed for me and such things are
[39:35] with him therefore I'm troubled at his
[39:38] presence when I consider I'm afraid of
[39:40] him for God maketh my heart soft and the
[39:44] almighty trouble me because I was not
[39:47] cut off from before the darkness neither
[39:50] was he covered the darkness from my face
[39:53] and one more scripture if you don't mind
[39:55] we'll read in John chap
[40:00] 12
[40:02] John
[40:05] 12 we'll start there in verse
[40:11] 20 this is um after the supper of of
[40:17] Bethany Jesus raised Lazarus from the
[40:20] dead and they uh had a service for or a
[40:24] meal a supper and Lazareth was at the
[40:27] table uh Martha was serving and Mary
[40:29] brought the big old pound of this Spike
[40:33] nerd and made this great testimony how
[40:35] she uh washed his feet with this Spike
[40:38] nerd and Jesus and and some of his
[40:41] disciples they saw this they heard it
[40:43] and they kind of marveled and and Judas
[40:46] you know he came to that place where he
[40:47] said you know this could have been uh uh
[40:51] you know sold and given to the poor and
[40:53] you know it was it was something that
[40:55] was on her heart to do for the Lord and
[40:58] you know it was uh you know something
[41:01] that caused a reaction from Judas to run
[41:04] out and now you know because the
[41:06] scripture says he was a thief and you
[41:09] know my you just think about all these
[41:10] wonderful scriptures but here he comes
[41:13] in the triumphal entry and um we'll pick
[41:16] it up here in the story it says and
[41:19] there was certain Greeks among them that
[41:21] came up to worship at the feast and the
[41:24] same came therefore to Philip
[41:26] which was of
[41:28] bedda of Galilee and Desiring him saying
[41:32] sir we would see
[41:34] Jesus Phillip cometh and tth Andrew and
[41:39] again Andrew and Phillip tth Jesus and
[41:42] Jesus answered in saying the hour is
[41:45] come that the son of man should be
[41:48] glorified verily I say unto you except a
[41:51] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[41:54] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[41:57] bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth
[42:01] his life shall lose it but he that
[42:03] hateth his life in this world shall keep
[42:07] it until eternal life if any man serve
[42:10] me let him follow me and where I am
[42:14] there shall also my servant be if any
[42:18] man Shall Serve
[42:20] me him will my father honor now is my
[42:24] soul troubled and what shall I say
[42:27] father save me from this hour but for
[42:29] this cause shall
[42:32] I for this
[42:34] cause unto this hour father glorify thy
[42:38] name then came a voice from Heaven
[42:41] saying I have glorified it and will
[42:44] glorify it
[42:45] again and the people therefore that
[42:48] stood by heard it they said it thundered
[42:51] and others said an angel spake to him
[42:54] and Jesus answered and said this this
[42:56] voice came not because of me but because
[42:58] for your sakes now is the Judgment of
[43:01] the this world now shall the prince of
[43:04] this world be cast out and if I if I be
[43:08] lifted up from Earth will I draw men
[43:10] unto me amen we trust the Lord will add
[43:13] a blessing to the reading of his word
[43:14] you may have your
[43:21] seats you know it's um real special to
[43:25] be a a assembled together and to be a
[43:27] part of a body you know where God can
[43:29] come and he can he can strengthen us as
[43:32] a body you know this is not a oneman
[43:34] Ministry this is every part every person
[43:38] doing their part we all have to come
[43:40] prayed up we all have to come with the
[43:43] expectation we all have to repent we all
[43:45] have to do what's right in the sight of
[43:47] the Lord you know and one of the things
[43:50] that I I just I was so grateful for and
[43:54] and I just appreciate everybody's
[43:55] testimon and something that stood out to
[43:57] me on watch Night Service is you know
[44:00] our brother Roger was saying that you
[44:02] know this is a year of Victory you know
[44:05] and I really believe that with all my
[44:06] heart there's things that are are
[44:08] burdening people but I believe victories
[44:11] around the corner you know and I believe
[44:13] that faith is our Victory amen if if we
[44:16] could just get down hone down and lay
[44:18] everything else to the side and cry out
[44:20] for faith that's what God Said through
[44:23] his prophet he said more than anything
[44:25] we should pray for
[44:26] Revelation amen and I say sometimes Lord
[44:30] you know I just kind of get into the
[44:31] routine in my prayer life and I just
[44:33] kind of you know go about what I think I
[44:36] need but if I'll just go back to what
[44:38] the prophet said and just pray for
[44:40] Revelation amen and so one of the things
[44:43] that I realize is you
[44:46] know a lot of times we just say like
[44:49] with the testings and the trials
[44:50] enough's enough you know I just don't
[44:52] really want to be in this season anymore
[44:54] and I love how David Avid junr said
[44:56] don't despise the season that you're in
[44:59] I really appreciate that because you
[45:01] know there's a lot of times where you're
[45:03] going through something and you're just
[45:04] saying I just want to get on the other
[45:06] side of this I don't want to have to go
[45:08] through this struggle but listen Church
[45:10] there's no shortcuts with God we must
[45:13] endure while we have time we must take
[45:16] the word of God and pray God the spirit
[45:18] to Quicken The Word of Life to
[45:21] us we must hold forth to the Word of
[45:24] Promise and I was thinking about how you
[45:29] know it's in the times of testing it's
[45:31] in the times of trial that God can
[45:34] become a
[45:36] reality you know it's it's in those
[45:40] valleys of
[45:42] decision you know just like job said
[45:46] there he came to that place where he was
[45:49] going through a lot but there was
[45:51] something inside of him that he knew he
[45:53] come God's provided way he knew he came
[45:57] from he he walked according to what the
[46:00] sacrifice that God said that he must
[46:02] keep he kept his commandment he kept his
[46:04] word and that was his stand and his
[46:06] testimony he says when I come out of
[46:08] this I'm going to come as pure
[46:10] gold he's identifying himself with
[46:15] deity that's what gold is representative
[46:24] of
[46:26] you know I just before I get too far
[46:28] going I just wanted to share kind of the
[46:31] inspiration of what I wanted to share
[46:33] with you but this was out of a message
[46:36] called the reproach for the cause of the
[46:39] word and when Matthew was preaching um
[46:42] Sunday a couple evenings ago he
[46:44] mentioned you know like what Lord put it
[46:46] on his heart what are you looking at and
[46:48] um you know he' referred to when brother
[46:51] brandham um you know those seven vision
[46:55] Visions or the seven dreams and then he
[46:57] ended up having it and he came to a
[47:00] place you know our Prophet suffered a
[47:01] lot you know he talked about in this
[47:04] message how that the the power of God
[47:07] Came Upon him and I don't think we could
[47:11] ever understand or Con in our mind how
[47:14] he suffered but the man came to a place
[47:18] where he was numb all over and and you
[47:21] know we just have to believe it by faith
[47:24] that he was a special built birth
[47:27] to bring us a message you know and and
[47:31] as he was sharing some things out of
[47:34] this message it began to encourage my
[47:36] heart because just like those Greeks
[47:40] they wanted to see Jesus you know and
[47:44] and you and I want to see Jesus not a
[47:47] historical figure not a something of the
[47:50] past but we want to see a present tense
[47:53] God because he's the same true am
[47:59] am in verse uh or excuse me in in
[48:02] paragraph 77 out of the reproach for the
[48:06] cause of the
[48:08] word brother brandham launches out and
[48:10] he says now God has a time and a reason
[48:14] for that time now I want you to
[48:16] personalize this in your
[48:19] life to fulfill his works all his Works
[48:24] God knows just EX exactly what he's
[48:26] going to do we don't we just have to we
[48:30] had to receive it as he gives it to us
[48:33] but he knows and there's nothing going
[48:35] wrong with what he's planned to
[48:39] do it has to all come out
[48:43] about there has to be sometimes rugged
[48:46] and hard things to only bring out the
[48:49] real true nature of an
[48:53] object you know rain is born out of the
[48:56] jagged ragged lightning stro thundering
[49:00] skies and if we didn't have rain we
[49:04] wouldn't
[49:05] live but you see what it takes to bring
[49:11] rain thunder lightning flashing anger
[49:15] and out of it comes
[49:18] rain that's good you know I want a
[49:22] Revival you know sometimes it takes the
[49:26] jagged lightning the the hard trials the
[49:30] squeezing out the
[49:32] pressing you know you just grab an
[49:35] orange and say Asher grab this orange
[49:38] and squeeze this Orange what's going to
[49:41] come out of that
[49:42] orange orange juice so sometimes you get
[49:47] a you get pressure and get squeezed on
[49:49] and then you begin to realize there's
[49:51] God in here I I wasn't even thinking to
[49:55] respond like this but that was Christ in
[49:57] me that was Christ in you you begin to
[50:00] see ah if it wasn't for this trial how
[50:04] would I see Jesus how would I see the
[50:08] same God the same Messiah still
[50:10] contacting and preserving
[50:13] Humanity it's not his will that man
[50:15] would perish he I would that all would
[50:19] be saved that none would be
[50:23] lost my think of
[50:28] it but it takes that to bring the rain
[50:32] we must die rot corrupt smell go back to
[50:37] the dust of the Earth in order to bring
[50:40] forth new
[50:42] life it takes the pounding of gold turn
[50:46] it over and over back and forth pounding
[50:50] until all the dross is taken out not
[50:53] because it shines because iron pyite
[50:56] what you know is fool's gold shines like
[50:59] real gold but you put them together you
[51:02] set them out one side and you can hardly
[51:05] tell them apart but put them together
[51:08] and you can tell it the beater always
[51:12] has to beat until he can see his own
[51:15] image reflecting in the
[51:20] gold and God sets a time and a p purpose
[51:25] for everything that he does there's
[51:28] nothing that just hap just accidentally
[51:31] to those who love the Lord and are
[51:33] called according to his
[51:37] calling we are
[51:39] predestinated and everything works just
[51:42] right for that because he cannot lie he
[51:47] said that it was so and everything has
[51:50] its time its season and it has its way
[51:55] and God is behind every
[51:58] move and sometimes you think
[52:00] everything's going wrong it's up to us
[52:04] right those things are put on us trials
[52:07] and wonderings it's testings to see how
[52:12] we will react to an
[52:14] action you know and I begin to think
[52:17] about this and I begin to ponder and the
[52:20] Lord just you know if if I was going to
[52:24] title the the message to you tonight I
[52:26] would title
[52:27] it you know reflecting the image of the
[52:32] beater you know and sometimes if it was
[52:36] if it was your decision or mine if
[52:38] you're anything like me I would not
[52:41] choose this beating
[52:45] right you know so so it's like as I
[52:49] begin to ponder how many times we Tred
[52:53] to run from the things that God's
[52:56] placing on our lap but if we'll just
[52:59] embrace it and not despise it then God
[53:02] he he will bring about what he promised
[53:13] amen you know I'm so grateful that God
[53:16] has provided a way for me to be in
[53:19] fellowship and it's the same way anybody
[53:21] comes in Fellowship right we don't have
[53:24] the corner on the market
[53:25] as it were you know if if you'll look to
[53:29] what Jesus Christ did and the work that
[53:32] he performed that's God's provided way
[53:35] of
[53:36] Fellowship that you know God said if
[53:38] you'll repent and be baptized in the
[53:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall
[53:43] receive the birth the Holy
[53:46] Ghost amen isn't that wonderful
[53:54] right
[53:55] you know I just thought it would be good
[53:57] to run through
[53:59] and go through a few scriptures I I was
[54:01] amazed while I was studying just going
[54:04] through the scripture there's so much
[54:06] stuff that just begins to open up and
[54:08] you you just like praise God there's so
[54:11] much in the word of God for us and you
[54:15] know I think you know it it's it's Times
[54:17] Like These that you know if we can let
[54:20] go of some things of the world and just
[54:24] really show the Lord how much he means
[54:27] to us you know I I think this is an hour
[54:31] where you know God is looking for
[54:34] worshippers who will worship in spirit
[54:37] and in truth right and and we have the
[54:42] truth but a lot of times we are in
[54:45] another Spirit like my mind's so geared
[54:48] on uh something else you know we we're
[54:52] looking and we're feeding on this and
[54:54] we're feeding on that and it it occupies
[54:57] the real estate in our mind and so as
[55:00] much as we want to we're in the spirit
[55:03] of that and it takes really like you
[55:08] know I was just going through something
[55:10] with my eyes and something led me to
[55:13] realize that you know cuz everything in
[55:15] the natural types the spiritual and and
[55:20] you know a lot of things that has
[55:22] happened in technology and the world as
[55:25] Humanity not just us but it's targeted
[55:28] on us because the devil don't want you
[55:32] to come into maturity he's afraid of
[55:36] you you are on his Hit List he doesn't
[55:40] sleep he's come to church he's wanting
[55:43] to knock your your legs from under you
[55:45] he's wanting to punch the air out of you
[55:48] he does not want you to have that
[55:51] communion and fellowship with Christ
[55:53] where it'll be the same love it'll be
[55:55] the same hope it'll be the same Faith
[55:58] it'll be the same God moving in human
[56:01] flesh again it doesn't matter how old or
[56:04] how young what your problems are turn
[56:09] your eyes away from your problems and
[56:11] let's turn our eyes upon the
[56:21] Lord you know and I realized
[56:26] we do a lot of looking
[56:29] down you know
[56:32] right but the scriptures admonished us
[56:35] to look up when you see that day
[56:38] approaching you know there's a lot of
[56:41] struggles right there's a lot of things
[56:43] going on in this world that you just
[56:45] want to shrug your shoulders and look
[56:47] down but for the believer I say let's
[56:50] look
[56:51] [Music]
[56:52] up I this is something something very
[56:56] simple but this is something that the
[56:58] Lord dealt with my heart and I just said
[57:00] Lord help me I didn't bring my phone out
[57:02] here but I'll just use this can't use
[57:05] that but I I'll just say like for
[57:08] example if this was my phone a lot of
[57:11] times when we look at our phone we look
[57:14] down we're looking
[57:16] down and I believe that's a trap of the
[57:19] enemy so that you won't fulfill the
[57:22] scripture and not only s scientifically
[57:25] people are starting to come doctors are
[57:28] starting to come to this understanding
[57:30] that there is a blockage of blood flow
[57:33] from the head to the body there's a
[57:36] blockage of blood flow a Life Source
[57:39] there's too much toxins in our minds
[57:42] there's not enough time for it to
[57:44] release because we're looking down too
[57:47] much we need to let our head be lifted
[57:53] up stop looking at that
[57:56] device give it a rest let's look up to
[57:59] the promis giver if you have a gift in
[58:03] your life don't squelch it by looking at
[58:05] somebody else's gift that sold it to the
[58:09] world we want to look to Jesus Christ
[58:12] he's the author and finisher of our
[58:14] faith right we're not going to find it
[58:16] on some YouTube
[58:19] video we're going to find it in the
[58:21] promised word of God in the message of
[58:23] the hour
[58:27] let's look up
[58:28] Saints I was looking there's these these
[58:32] arteries and there's these veins there's
[58:34] like a jugler vein and a carded artery
[58:37] one sends the blood up the other one
[58:40] sends the blood back down and this is
[58:43] just this is just the way God fearfully
[58:45] and wonderfully made the body but
[58:48] there's a devil that knows you better
[58:51] than you know yourself he knows what you
[58:53] like he knows what what I like and he
[58:55] knows how to lay a
[58:57] snare and he
[58:59] entices he he he he throws a little this
[59:02] and a little of that and you taste it
[59:03] and you're like my that's just my taste
[59:06] that's just my flavor matter of fact get
[59:08] that at 70 degrees why don't you I mean
[59:12] we're
[59:13] guilty like a little
[59:16] inconvenience they didn't do it my way
[59:19] you know but the devil knows and that's
[59:22] just to get us red up in the carnal side
[59:25] but Jesus Christ is here to say I've
[59:27] given you a new birth I I have given you
[59:31] something that will declare some
[59:33] satisfying
[59:35] something it'll be like that woman at
[59:37] the well she'll come to that realization
[59:40] it'll be a reality like nothing
[59:47] else my people are under these pressures
[59:52] because there's too much toxins
[59:55] you know a man is not he wasn't made to
[59:58] die he wasn't made to feed on this kind
[1:00:01] of garbage and we're pouring it in
[1:00:04] pouring it in and we're not giving it
[1:00:06] enough time to detox what we need to do
[1:00:09] is let go we need to let God deal with
[1:00:12] our hearts why you know this is the
[1:00:15] thing that we can either humble
[1:00:17] ourselves to the realities of God or be
[1:00:19] humbled amen sometimes God will allow
[1:00:22] sickness because he's like look you're
[1:00:24] going astray I had to snap the legs of
[1:00:27] the one because he was taking a worldly
[1:00:29] way away from the shepherd
[1:00:36] amen you're his you ain't getting
[1:00:39] away right how much suffering do we want
[1:00:42] to go through I mean there's a measure
[1:00:44] of suffering that we're all going to go
[1:00:46] through because we're his but praise God
[1:00:49] I wasn't I wasn't saved to to just run
[1:00:52] off and do my own thing
[1:00:56] that never satisfied I tried it for
[1:00:59] years it just left an emptiness but
[1:01:03] praise God when he came in and I learned
[1:01:05] how to yield oh my how many can testify
[1:01:09] to it when you learn how to yield it
[1:01:12] brings forth a peace and a joy and a
[1:01:15] contentment I mean can can anybody say
[1:01:18] man when you've been used by God for
[1:01:20] somebody's
[1:01:22] soul my
[1:01:25] there's
[1:01:28] like Boo
[1:01:30] devil out of
[1:01:32] here you know it's like to see someone
[1:01:37] pass from Death to life there's no
[1:01:39] greater miracle I mean we love to see
[1:01:41] the sick who who who have been badly and
[1:01:44] healed but my when when your life had
[1:01:49] been submitted to God in such a way that
[1:01:51] God said I want you to go over here you
[1:01:53] you can just drop the mail off and then
[1:01:55] while you're there you say why would
[1:01:57] that person just oh excuse me ma'am you
[1:01:59] drop something and she just begins to
[1:02:01] tear up and all of a sudden you say you
[1:02:04] know there's a there's a God and he
[1:02:06] cares just a simple word you have a life
[1:02:11] inside that somebody you can change
[1:02:14] their whole world because of what's
[1:02:17] inside of
[1:02:18] you the life that you have bubbling
[1:02:22] within is a Fountain of Living
[1:02:27] water it's just will we contaminate that
[1:02:32] and just let it just be part of everyday
[1:02:37] life Lord let it not be in my
[1:02:42] life this is out of
[1:02:46] the church age
[1:02:49] book Ephesians Church age
[1:02:53] um this this is paragraph 55 he
[1:02:57] says so there they are full of the Holy
[1:02:59] Ghost and faith on fire with the fire of
[1:03:02] God holding forth the word of Truth and
[1:03:05] there he stands back them to back them
[1:03:08] up I think of it not one believer of any
[1:03:11] age never cried in his heart oh that I
[1:03:14] might be back there the first age when
[1:03:16] the apostles first went were sent out
[1:03:19] there is no need to look back look up
[1:03:22] Behold Him who is even walking in the
[1:03:25] midst of the churches throughout
[1:03:27] all the ages Behold Him who is the same
[1:03:32] yesterday today and forever who never
[1:03:35] changes in his essence or his ways where
[1:03:39] there where two or three are gathered
[1:03:41] together in his name there he is in the
[1:03:44] midst not only is there in in his midst
[1:03:48] as a complacent onlooker or as a
[1:03:50] recording Angel but there he stands
[1:03:53] expressing exactly what he
[1:03:57] is my he's in the midst of us and he's
[1:04:00] the life and sustainer and Giver of all
[1:04:04] good gifts to the church
[1:04:11] Hallelujah who walketh in the midst of
[1:04:14] the seven golden
[1:04:15] candlesticks how meaningful are those
[1:04:18] words when viewed in the light of the
[1:04:22] scripture which describes him as Christ
[1:04:24] who is our life for Christ indeed is the
[1:04:27] life and of the
[1:04:30] church she has no other life without him
[1:04:34] she is simply a religious Society a club
[1:04:37] a meaningless Gathering of people as a
[1:04:40] corpse bejweled and dressed is still a
[1:04:43] corpse so is a church no matter how her
[1:04:47] programs and her gracious efforts might
[1:04:49] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[1:04:53] also
[1:04:54] but with him in her midst with him
[1:04:57] motivating her she has become The Wonder
[1:05:01] of all his body the fullness of him that
[1:05:05] filth all in all and this is the very
[1:05:08] hour that he is walking in the midst in
[1:05:12] the the in the last AG's golden
[1:05:17] Candlestick what he was as he walked in
[1:05:20] the first age he is even now in this
[1:05:23] last age
[1:05:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:05:27] and forever aren't you glad about that
[1:05:31] to be able to become the wonderment of
[1:05:34] all his body the fullness of him that
[1:05:38] filth all in all amen you know whenever
[1:05:42] I like to see if you know my tie matches
[1:05:45] or something sometimes I'll look in the
[1:05:47] mirror but mostly I ask my wife but but
[1:05:49] you know that's just what we want to do
[1:05:51] is look into the word of God and see if
[1:05:54] that Spirit man is looking at the right
[1:05:57] thing you know a lot of times all we see
[1:06:00] when we look at ourselves is we see
[1:06:02] failure and faults and shortcomings and
[1:06:05] problems and different things but I want
[1:06:07] to say this let's look to what he's
[1:06:10] saying about you about me about
[1:06:15] us with him motivating
[1:06:21] us now in this is um kind of a lengthy
[1:06:26] reading but I I feel it's important so
[1:06:29] in 57 says the seven golden candles
[1:06:32] sticks the the True Church of Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ the bride is likened to pure gold
[1:06:38] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:06:41] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:06:44] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:06:47] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[1:06:51] she is to manifest there is is no fault
[1:06:54] in her she is all glorious within and
[1:06:57] without from beginning to end ending she
[1:07:01] is the work of her Lord and all his
[1:07:04] works are
[1:07:06] perfect in fact in her is summed up and
[1:07:09] manifest the Eternal wisdom and purpose
[1:07:11] of God yes sir how can one fathom it how
[1:07:14] can one understand it though we cannot
[1:07:18] do that we accept it by faith for God
[1:07:20] has spoken it but not only is the
[1:07:24] candlesticks of gold it is of beaten
[1:07:26] gold handcrafted of beaten gold
[1:07:29] according to her blueprints which this
[1:07:32] the spe which is was were spirit-given
[1:07:34] outside of her Lord and Master Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ was ever a people beaten and
[1:07:42] purged as the bride of Christ Jesus
[1:07:45] Christ surely she is filled up with
[1:07:48] sufferings that Christ had left behind
[1:07:51] her goods are
[1:07:52] despoiled
[1:07:54] her life is in
[1:07:56] Jeopardy she is counted as sheep for the
[1:07:59] slaughter she is killed all the day long
[1:08:03] she suffers much but in it all
[1:08:06] retaliates not neither does she cause
[1:08:10] hert others to suffer worthy of the
[1:08:13] Gospel is the lovely bride of Christ and
[1:08:17] as the gold is malleable wherein brass
[1:08:20] will break with its beating the gold of
[1:08:23] God will bear her suffering for the Lord
[1:08:26] not bowed not broken not destroyed but
[1:08:30] formed as a thing of beauty and joy
[1:08:33] Forever by the trials and the testings
[1:08:37] of this life amen I think those are
[1:08:39] wonderful scriptures you know to
[1:08:41] encourage our faith that you know when
[1:08:43] you're going through something God's
[1:08:45] he's with us right you know I think
[1:08:48] about Moses he says you know hey you're
[1:08:50] going to go out there and he goes well
[1:08:53] if I'm going to have to to do all of
[1:08:54] that I ain't going unless you come with
[1:08:57] me if you're going through something and
[1:09:00] God knows that you got to go through it
[1:09:03] to get to that beaten goal that he can
[1:09:07] see his own reflection
[1:09:10] in my I don't want a shortcut I say God
[1:09:13] just walk with me you said you were
[1:09:16] walking in the midst of the church I
[1:09:18] believe it I am a recipient of that
[1:09:21] reality so I'm going to take this trial
[1:09:24] I'm going to take this thing and watch
[1:09:26] you make it a
[1:09:28] blessing there's no other thing cuz
[1:09:31] God's work his works are
[1:09:35] perfect he knows what we have need
[1:09:42] of
[1:09:43] my yeah I'm going to have to try to
[1:09:46] skip a little bit
[1:09:50] maybe yeah let's let's go right here and
[1:09:53] say in in ' 62 the first age suffered
[1:09:58] great persecution it had the works he
[1:10:02] had to work hard to preach the gospel
[1:10:03] and shed forth truth their High Calling
[1:10:06] in life was to serve
[1:10:10] God and when their hope in life were
[1:10:13] blighted they were patient and committed
[1:10:16] all to him who had promised the
[1:10:21] Everlasting recompense in heaven for
[1:10:24] what they had given up for on
[1:10:29] Earth and in 64 says no matter how just
[1:10:32] or upright a Christian is before the
[1:10:34] public or how gracious he is to his
[1:10:36] fellow men doing not but good let him
[1:10:41] confess Christ as the Savior and
[1:10:43] acknowledge the operation of the gifts
[1:10:45] of the Holy Ghost in tongues and
[1:10:47] prophecies healings and miracles and he
[1:10:49] will be
[1:10:52] condemned the this faith that we believe
[1:10:55] when you testify of it you will be
[1:10:58] condemned that's right think it not
[1:11:05] strange but the good thing is is when
[1:11:08] you're persecuted for his name sake
[1:11:10] there comes
[1:11:11] power so don't be don't be
[1:11:14] fearful fear
[1:11:17] not the spirit of this world hates the
[1:11:20] spirit of God and because it can
[1:11:23] overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries
[1:11:25] to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit
[1:11:28] of Truth
[1:11:29] dwells persecution and trials are
[1:11:32] natural normal part of a Christian Life
[1:11:35] there is only one thing that you can do
[1:11:37] about
[1:11:39] them there's only one thing commit them
[1:11:42] all to God judge not and leave the
[1:11:46] outworking and the final judgment to
[1:11:51] him Lord this is your word
[1:11:55] amen I believe
[1:12:00] it thou c not bear them which are evil
[1:12:04] and thou H has tried them that say they
[1:12:07] are Apostles and are not and found them
[1:12:09] Liars these Ephesians believe that God
[1:12:12] God's people ought to be holy according
[1:12:15] to this verse they took steps to
[1:12:18] keep the body unleavened from sin most
[1:12:23] evidently the uh apostasy had already
[1:12:27] started sin had entered into the church
[1:12:30] but they were obedient to the words of
[1:12:33] Paul when he said to put away the wicked
[1:12:36] from among them they were a separated
[1:12:39] people they had come out of the world
[1:12:43] and they were not going to let the world
[1:12:45] enter in among them they wouldn't put up
[1:12:49] with the sin in the church Holiness
[1:12:51] wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of
[1:12:54] speech it was a way of life amen Lord
[1:12:58] help us you know I just I just thought
[1:13:00] as I was going through that with my eyes
[1:13:04] and it just you know a lot of times we
[1:13:06] pray and we even doubt our own prayers
[1:13:08] you know we go through and God he
[1:13:10] promised he said that I will lead you
[1:13:12] and guide you into all truth and
[1:13:14] righteousness and a lot of times the
[1:13:17] things that we're struggling and going
[1:13:18] through are stuff that we've we're we're
[1:13:20] just bearing fruit of stuff that we've
[1:13:22] swn into the world right I mean
[1:13:26] pressures the cares of life you know all
[1:13:28] of these things cuz God saying like I
[1:13:31] have provided the way of life for you
[1:13:35] and yet he's standing there with the
[1:13:36] medicine and he's trying to give it to
[1:13:38] us and yet we it's just because we have
[1:13:42] an
[1:13:43] adversary and he tricks us but I help
[1:13:47] help me Lord to take the medicine
[1:13:50] yes you know and God allows us to see
[1:13:53] certain things and when we go through
[1:13:55] things hardships and trials it's like
[1:13:58] praise God praise
[1:14:02] God you know I just um you know it just
[1:14:06] really dawned on me
[1:14:07] how Jesus in in John here in chapter 12
[1:14:13] and kind of lost track of
[1:14:16] time everybody feeling
[1:14:19] okay you know it's one of those things
[1:14:22] that you know we just we can't have
[1:14:24] enough of God so we just keep pressing
[1:14:26] on but you know I just thought about how
[1:14:30] that you know sometimes we go through
[1:14:33] trials and testings because God is
[1:14:37] waiting to see your
[1:14:39] reaction you know do we even give God a
[1:14:42] chance sometimes we just react like this
[1:14:46] is
[1:14:46] instinctual slap me I slap him
[1:14:49] back you know that's just reaction but
[1:14:52] God what he's trying to bring us to is
[1:14:55] the stature of a perfect man this is the
[1:14:58] place where he wants to dwell he wants
[1:15:00] to abide in every circumstance every
[1:15:03] situation and so we're going to go
[1:15:05] through different things difficulties
[1:15:07] and trials because what he's trying to
[1:15:09] do is come into Oneness with us that was
[1:15:12] his desire from the beginning is that he
[1:15:15] can take your eyes and look at the right
[1:15:18] things he can take your hands and be in
[1:15:20] service for the right things he can take
[1:15:22] your feet to go to the right
[1:15:25] places he can use your heart to speak
[1:15:28] the word in season that'll change
[1:15:31] somebody else's life no matter your hurt
[1:15:34] no matter your heartache no matter your
[1:15:37] difficulty or the strain that God can
[1:15:39] come by his your way and he can say I
[1:15:42] have a servant that is willing to lay
[1:15:45] His Garment to the side and take up mine
[1:15:47] and that I could speak amen isn't that
[1:15:50] your desire I say Lord help
[1:15:53] heal my eyes give me that kind of vision
[1:15:56] every
[1:15:57] moment
[1:16:01] amen
[1:16:04] amen you know there in chapter 12 I I
[1:16:07] just I thought about it and uh brother
[1:16:11] Brandon preached a message
[1:16:14] um I believe it was called the
[1:16:18] uh I identified Masterpiece of God you
[1:16:23] know God has identified his
[1:16:26] Masterpiece and you're included in it
[1:16:29] you might not realize it but God has
[1:16:32] included you in that Masterpiece and one
[1:16:36] thing that just it just woed my heart I
[1:16:39] said God yes that's what I want I want
[1:16:43] that kind of Victory but Jesus when
[1:16:46] Philip and Andrew you know they were the
[1:16:49] ones that God was dealing with them
[1:16:51] before when there was 5,000 and he asked
[1:16:55] Philip and Andrew he says hey you know
[1:16:57] look at all these people just hey go
[1:16:59] over there and get them to sit down sit
[1:17:01] down like man he's like he he was going
[1:17:04] to put them to see what kind of reaction
[1:17:06] they would have and he says uh you know
[1:17:09] what about the food like Andrew and
[1:17:12] Philip
[1:17:13] like we're outnumbered here you know
[1:17:17] it's like math ain't working you know
[1:17:20] and that's what God does with us
[1:17:22] sometimes he wants you to see where
[1:17:24] you're looking at something through the
[1:17:25] eye of human understanding but he's he's
[1:17:29] he's seeing your reaction if you'll let
[1:17:31] your faith loose for a moment and let
[1:17:34] him come in and say I can do exceedingly
[1:17:37] abundantly what you can think or ask and
[1:17:40] so Philip and Andrew they say well and
[1:17:42] he knew I don't know exactly where that
[1:17:45] is but I'll just paraphrase it for now
[1:17:47] but you know so they had this experience
[1:17:50] where all of a sudden now they're
[1:17:51] handing stuff out and they're witnessing
[1:17:54] they're experiencing something where
[1:17:56] this reality that they had a hunger
[1:17:58] inside now they've seen it they are ey
[1:18:01] Witnesses of it am and so all of the
[1:18:04] sudden God now he's got some witnesses
[1:18:07] that are being used these Greeks they
[1:18:09] were Scholars they had a wisdom and all
[1:18:12] this kind of stuff they want to see
[1:18:14] Jesus and so Philip and Andrew they're
[1:18:16] consult let's go we're taking them to
[1:18:19] Jesus and a lot of times people just
[1:18:21] think well we just got to get them to
[1:18:23] church but he's saying get them to
[1:18:27] Jesus and you don't have to go to a
[1:18:29] building to get people to Jesus you just
[1:18:31] have to go back to where you met him
[1:18:34] he's right there in your
[1:18:38] heart the power of God to turn them
[1:18:41] loose is the same power that came and
[1:18:44] now opened the door to Liberty for you
[1:18:47] and
[1:18:48] me praise
[1:18:51] God let's not forget get that it's not
[1:18:54] hey come on hey I want to see him
[1:18:57] fulfill the word of God but my like if
[1:19:02] that salt could ever
[1:19:04] contact why they were okay and so Jesus
[1:19:08] he's standing there and he says as
[1:19:10] they're coming to him you you would
[1:19:11] think oh you know he's going to show
[1:19:13] them something he says except a corn of
[1:19:16] wheat Dy it abideth alone can you
[1:19:20] imagine those guys
[1:19:21] going
[1:19:24] what is he talking
[1:19:26] about and some of you might be saying
[1:19:28] the same thing what is he talking about
[1:19:32] well I just want to tell you how it
[1:19:34] struck me you
[1:19:37] know he died he did his part he raised
[1:19:41] from the dead and I believe that God's
[1:19:44] calling us to be more consecrated more
[1:19:48] dedicated to to be able to lay our life
[1:19:51] down like he said to do if any man come
[1:19:54] after me let him deny
[1:20:02] himself it's so
[1:20:04] easy to
[1:20:06] take the attitude and the
[1:20:09] approach this is what I
[1:20:12] believe and I'm I'm holding to that and
[1:20:15] I believe that but if it ever becomes
[1:20:18] something more to where it's now it's
[1:20:21] not I that liveth but it's Christ in
[1:20:24] me now now we're talking about something
[1:20:28] that people want to see they don't want
[1:20:31] to see all of our Doctrine because the
[1:20:33] letter
[1:20:34] kth but the spirit the spirit giveth
[1:20:38] life and I say just as others would come
[1:20:42] and they would want to see Jesus how are
[1:20:44] they going to see him how are they going
[1:20:46] to see Jesus they're going to see Jesus
[1:20:48] in you in
[1:20:51] me
[1:20:53] who Who Am I who are you I look back at
[1:20:56] some of the things that I come out of
[1:20:59] huh I say God you could take
[1:21:03] anybody you can just take dust and make
[1:21:07] it thus but my think about it he chose
[1:21:11] you and the way that you look at
[1:21:13] yourself and your situation but he's not
[1:21:15] looking at that we want to look through
[1:21:18] his eyes and see us the way he sees
[1:21:21] us but it'll come through
[1:21:24] self-sacrifice really in order to really
[1:21:27] come to that place where I believe that
[1:21:29] I'm Desiring and I believe the Church of
[1:21:31] God is Desiring yes is to see Jesus we
[1:21:35] must come to that death and I know a lot
[1:21:37] of times we we say you know I've given
[1:21:39] my heart to the Lord I've relinquished
[1:21:42] everything but I believe it's like Paul
[1:21:44] said I Die
[1:21:46] daily I'm not satisfied with what I did
[1:21:49] yesterday the
[1:21:51] yielding the crying out the purging I
[1:21:55] say God what do you have for me today I
[1:21:58] want to be sensitive God is doing
[1:22:00] something every single day not just in
[1:22:02] the church service every morning his
[1:22:04] mercies are new you can come to the
[1:22:08] Fountain alone say God you have a word
[1:22:11] for your
[1:22:13] servant you know sometimes I believe
[1:22:15] it's just you know maybe we haven't seen
[1:22:17] his glory you know I know it changed the
[1:22:20] prophet Isaiah
[1:22:23] mhm he he testified he he he realized
[1:22:28] I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell with
[1:22:31] the people but oh my once he seen the
[1:22:34] train fing and all of those angels and
[1:22:37] he said wow I it changed him I mean he
[1:22:42] he you get into that presence and you
[1:22:44] fall over as a dead man but praise God
[1:22:48] that you're still
[1:22:49] alive because God has something more for
[1:22:52] for us to do you know you see the world
[1:22:55] going off in darkness but if any man
[1:22:58] will come after me let him deny
[1:23:02] himself it's one of the hardest things
[1:23:04] to do is to die and
[1:23:08] rot
[1:23:18] my you know he said this and and um to
[1:23:21] just trust in the Lord
[1:23:23] Lord in Victory Day this is
[1:23:28] amazing brother brandom says this in
[1:23:30] 1962 on April 21st in Victory Day I was
[1:23:34] listening to it today and I just thought
[1:23:36] my goodness this was just a service at
[1:23:38] someone's home like at the introduction
[1:23:40] you can hear dog barking and some you
[1:23:42] know hey quiet down you know it's just
[1:23:45] in someone's home you know we're we'll
[1:23:47] probably end up having services in
[1:23:48] people's homes before this thing get
[1:23:51] there's some trouble Wat to be to be
[1:23:53] experienced I mean we got to take we got
[1:23:55] to redeem the time we got to get serious
[1:23:58] there's people inside the church that
[1:24:01] need a new
[1:24:02] birth God is allowing stresses and
[1:24:05] pressures that we can get serious and
[1:24:08] cry out and pour out before God and say
[1:24:11] this is my brother this is my sister I
[1:24:14] can't make it without
[1:24:16] you we're in this together let's lay
[1:24:20] everything to the side
[1:24:23] but this Victory Day brother brandham
[1:24:25] speaking of he says this and I'll pick
[1:24:27] up in
[1:24:28] um well I don't have the number but he
[1:24:30] says
[1:24:32] now there was a dday and then there was
[1:24:36] a V
[1:24:37] Day the dday was when they went in to
[1:24:41] fight the V Day is when there was a
[1:24:44] peace
[1:24:46] signed you know and I thought about that
[1:24:49] you know and and you know D D day this
[1:24:53] is dday It's Time to fight you know you
[1:24:56] think about Jacob you know Jacob he had
[1:25:00] that fight with the angel of the Lord
[1:25:04] you know and he fought and he wasn't
[1:25:06] going to stop fighting until he received
[1:25:09] that touch from the Lord he might have
[1:25:12] not wanted to fight if he knew the
[1:25:14] result at the end of it but it changed
[1:25:16] his walk he he got a name changed he had
[1:25:20] power after that and that's what the
[1:25:24] resurrection power can't come upon a
[1:25:27] Believer until he dies amen we must
[1:25:31] die die and rot and smell and corrupt to
[1:25:35] ourselves our own thinking our own
[1:25:37] attitudes so that it can be Christ the
[1:25:39] sweet humble Life of
[1:25:44] Christ now in 139 it says it seems like
[1:25:47] Christian Life if a fellow is not
[1:25:49] absolutely centered on Christ the
[1:25:51] Christian life seems like it holds many
[1:25:55] disappointments but those
[1:25:57] disappointments are God's Divine will
[1:25:59] happening for us now it don't seem like
[1:26:02] it would be that but it's God's way of
[1:26:05] doing
[1:26:07] things so along went Abraham and he
[1:26:10] finally came to the very then you
[1:26:13] see being so loyal more loyal more
[1:26:17] testing see so he brought him right back
[1:26:21] now remember remember when God has
[1:26:24] counted you worthy when you have a test
[1:26:28] now don't fail this to get this when you
[1:26:32] have a trial or a test it shows the
[1:26:35] grace of God has found you you found
[1:26:38] favor with God and God believes that
[1:26:41] you'll stand the
[1:26:43] test you know we need this Faith praise
[1:26:47] God God sent a prophet messenger at this
[1:26:49] end time that's saying the same thing
[1:26:51] that Paul said said this is the mercy of
[1:26:53] God before judgment this is this is what
[1:26:57] brings the healing to our understanding
[1:26:59] and our eyes I believe
[1:27:01] that you remember he said the same thing
[1:27:04] to
[1:27:06] job Satan said oh yes I see job down
[1:27:09] there said he's not God said God said he
[1:27:14] is a perfect servant there's none in the
[1:27:17] earth like him there's nobody like Jo
[1:27:20] job he's a perfect man
[1:27:23] now he's my pride and
[1:27:26] joy that's
[1:27:28] you your test your trials God has
[1:27:33] confidence he's put the test on you
[1:27:35] because when you come out of that it's
[1:27:37] going to be a beaten work for his glory
[1:27:40] it's going to be a testimony that others
[1:27:42] can say Divinity has flown through that
[1:27:46] place not only has it flown through it
[1:27:49] but it's
[1:27:51] abiding
[1:27:56] my
[1:28:04] my you know I just you know one of the
[1:28:07] things
[1:28:08] that you know I think that has been such
[1:28:11] a good thing about dealing with trials
[1:28:15] and difficulties you know you go through
[1:28:18] uh personal battles and a lot of times
[1:28:20] personal battles
[1:28:22] you know you just keep them personal
[1:28:24] it's between you and the Lord and so one
[1:28:28] of the things that I realize is
[1:28:29] sometimes when you contain those
[1:28:31] personal battles and those struggles you
[1:28:33] know it it tries to eat at you and so
[1:28:37] what what I I love I love is when
[1:28:41] brother Brandon preached that day on
[1:28:43] Calvary he says now look
[1:28:45] away and look what Calvary did for you
[1:28:48] if you haven't had a victory day you
[1:28:51] need to go to Calvary
[1:28:53] you know and and and you know Calvary is
[1:28:56] representing the cross and you know but
[1:29:00] what did it mean what does Calvary mean
[1:29:03] to you personally I think if we can't
[1:29:06] answer that question I think we should
[1:29:08] go to Calvary and let God answer and
[1:29:10] settle the question because if we don't
[1:29:13] look to the Cross see that was what the
[1:29:16] provision was in the Old Testament when
[1:29:19] they were being the children of Israel
[1:29:21] were being snake bitten you know the
[1:29:24] tactic of the devil is still snake
[1:29:26] biting people through these different
[1:29:28] devices these different influences these
[1:29:31] different pulls to to to tantalize our
[1:29:35] attention but these snake bites if there
[1:29:38] was people that wanted to escape from
[1:29:40] the leprosy or from the sting of the the
[1:29:44] Serpent's hiss they can look to a Brazen
[1:29:47] cross that God had lifted up in the
[1:29:49] wilderness to let the people go free
[1:29:51] said said if you will look to the Cross
[1:29:53] look to that you will
[1:29:56] live take your eyes off of well I got
[1:29:59] into this and I got snake bit you're not
[1:30:03] strong enough to take that poison from
[1:30:05] yourself but God has a
[1:30:08] toxine God has a holy ghost the hour has
[1:30:12] come to
[1:30:13] repent if you haven't been baptized be
[1:30:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:20] Christ
[1:30:22] let it be settled and when you come into
[1:30:25] the struggle and the trial you can take
[1:30:27] the fruit of God's word into your bosom
[1:30:31] and say I know my redeemer
[1:30:35] liveth and in the last day I will see
[1:30:38] him for myself this is the last days we
[1:30:41] want to see Jesus
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:57] know I'll just go to
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:01] Isaiah 53 for a
[1:31:04] moment you know if it wasn't for the
[1:31:08] prophecy of
[1:31:10] Isaiah
[1:31:12] speaking you know how would we
[1:31:14] understand how would we believe
[1:31:17] scripture says in 53 who has believed
[1:31:19] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:31:21] Lord Lord
[1:31:23] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[1:31:26] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[1:31:28] the dry
[1:31:30] ground Heath no form nor comeliness and
[1:31:34] when we see him there was no beauty that
[1:31:37] we should desire him he is despised and
[1:31:41] rejected of men a Man of
[1:31:45] Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[1:31:49] hid as it were our faces from from him
[1:31:53] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:31:57] surely he ha bore our griefs and carried
[1:32:00] our sin our
[1:32:01] sorrows yet we did esteemed him stricken
[1:32:05] smitten of God and
[1:32:07] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:32:10] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:32:12] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:32:15] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:32:19] healed am all we like sheep have gone
[1:32:22] astray and we have turned everyone to
[1:32:25] his own
[1:32:30] way we have turned everyone to his own
[1:32:34] way and the Lord had laid upon him the
[1:32:37] iniquity of us all he was oppressed and
[1:32:42] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[1:32:45] mouth he was brought as a lamb to the
[1:32:48] slaughter and as a sheep before for his
[1:32:52] shears is dumb so he opened not his
[1:32:57] mouth he was taken from the prison and
[1:33:00] from judgment and who shall declare his
[1:33:05] generation for he was cut off out of the
[1:33:08] land of the living for the transgression
[1:33:10] of my people was he
[1:33:13] stricken and he made his grave with the
[1:33:15] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:33:19] because he had done no violence neither
[1:33:22] was there any deceit in his mouth yet it
[1:33:25] pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath
[1:33:28] put on him he had put him to grief when
[1:33:32] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[1:33:36] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[1:33:40] prolong his days and as the pleasure of
[1:33:44] the Lord shall prosper in his hand he
[1:33:47] shall see the travail of his soul and
[1:33:50] shall be satisfied
[1:33:52] but his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:33:55] servant justify
[1:33:57] many for he shall bear their iniquity
[1:34:01] therefore I will divide a portion with
[1:34:04] the great and he shall divide the spoil
[1:34:07] with the strong because he had poured
[1:34:09] out his soul unto death and he had
[1:34:12] numbered with the transgressors and he
[1:34:14] bore the sins of many and made
[1:34:17] intercession for the
[1:34:19] transgressor you know and I just thought
[1:34:21] that's you know something that we need
[1:34:24] to revisit
[1:34:26] regularly you know sometimes I you know
[1:34:30] we we go through things and we
[1:34:33] agonize we
[1:34:35] suffer we go through
[1:34:37] things but if we could ever see what it
[1:34:42] really cost right if we could ever
[1:34:47] meditate you know I know there's a
[1:34:50] principle as a Christian if you'll think
[1:34:53] on the Lord and think what he's done for
[1:34:55] you you'll find that he'll come around
[1:34:58] your
[1:34:59] way because as you're thinking on him
[1:35:03] those other thoughts will start to melt
[1:35:07] away and I think it would be good for us
[1:35:09] to visit this in other scriptures
[1:35:12] thinking about you know how brother
[1:35:16] brandom you know he
[1:35:18] said I don't remember what scripture I
[1:35:20] think it was vict day but he was talking
[1:35:23] about how when The Gunshot went off and
[1:35:25] blew his leg out and he was in that
[1:35:28] place of you know they had given him
[1:35:30] some kind of anesthetic and it like
[1:35:32] pierced through his spine and his heart
[1:35:34] rate was going so low and I just you
[1:35:38] know I think he said like he gave he
[1:35:41] gave like a a testimony to God like you
[1:35:45] know if you know I can't remember out if
[1:35:48] this time I didn't print the the quote
[1:35:51] but you can listen to his testimony
[1:35:53] brother brandham suffered but he came to
[1:35:56] that place he was a beaten work for us
[1:36:00] it was unto the Lord a sweet smelling
[1:36:02] Savor but it was an
[1:36:04] example you know we don't want to just
[1:36:06] look and say oh our our precious brother
[1:36:09] and what he did and you know our Lord
[1:36:13] what he did but what was the
[1:36:16] cause it was for you so that you can
[1:36:20] have an example to follow to take
[1:36:22] courage to take heart in the hardships
[1:36:25] in the
[1:36:26] pressures you know and thinking about
[1:36:29] when he came to that place and then he
[1:36:31] you know something happened he was able
[1:36:33] to live and he just said you know I
[1:36:35] don't know how to do I do I pray right
[1:36:38] you know like am I put oh he didn't
[1:36:40] answer me because I didn't put my hands
[1:36:42] right or or I didn't say the right word
[1:36:46] this is helping somebody this is stored
[1:36:49] up food amen sometimes we go to prayer
[1:36:53] and we can't hardly think about anything
[1:36:57] but if we'll just focus God you hear my
[1:37:00] voice because I have an atoning blood
[1:37:02] I've come your provided sacrifice this
[1:37:05] is the only way that man can make peace
[1:37:08] with God and be
[1:37:09] justified right you were wounded you
[1:37:13] took this punishment for me and I know
[1:37:17] you hear my
[1:37:20] voice
[1:37:28] it's just a precious thing that you know
[1:37:30] I just recommend going and listening to
[1:37:32] brother brandom's testimony when he came
[1:37:34] to that dark place and he he draws
[1:37:37] strength from it and um my mind's kind
[1:37:40] of going blank on how it exactly went
[1:37:43] but you know you think about Paul you
[1:37:46] know I was looking in the book of Acts
[1:37:49] 17 I know many of y all know the
[1:37:52] scripture and are familiar but when
[1:37:54] Jesus revealed himself to Paul or Saul
[1:37:58] he says you're going to suffer many
[1:38:00] things for my name's sake but I have a
[1:38:03] work for you to
[1:38:04] do God has a work for you to do and in
[1:38:09] preparation for that work there's going
[1:38:11] to be a struggle but without the
[1:38:14] struggle there's no
[1:38:17] overcoming without the trial there's no
[1:38:20] victory there's got to be a dday a day
[1:38:22] of fighting let's rise up let's take the
[1:38:26] word of God we got the sword we got the

[1:38:52] fight the rapture's coming when it's
[1:38:56] coming but there's brothers and sisters
