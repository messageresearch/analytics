Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
October 8, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

see brother Mike and sister Ellen God bless you it's good to have you with us amen let's go ahead and bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we truly do Lord sing with those words that you are very welcome in this place Lord as we say often Lord to just come together to see one another and to have fellowship and to hold a church service Lord it would just be another gathering of man if it wasn't for your presence and for your word Lord as we sang earlier father may you just continue to turn our eyes upon you that the things of this world would grow strangely dim Lord we pray that as you come that you would Lord that you'd speak to each one Lord you know every question every desire every need that has come into the place and Lord as your word is set Lord we' have come bringing that part of you that we've had fellowship with all week long we bring it together here father that you might join us and speak to us as we sit at your feet and as we worship your name we commit the service to you that your will would be done that every need would be met as you promised in Jesus name amen you may be seated we're going to turn to Psalm 75 this morning and you know this is just a short little Psalm it's a Psalm of Asaf and uh you know as you remember from the scripture Asaf was was one of the ministers in the Tabernacle one of the leaders of worship you know but he was also among other things a prophet it says in 2 Chronicles 29:30 it calls him Asaf The Seer and in 1 Chronicles 252 it speaks of the sons of Asaf under the hands of Asaf which prophesied according to the order of the king you know so I always you know pay close attention attention to the Psalms that Asaf writes knowing that you know he was a prophet and there was an interesting statement that he made in verse one I just want to you know that kind of caught my attention it says unto thee Oh God do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near yes thy wondrous Works declare that's the statement that caught my attention for that thy name is near yes thy wondrous Works declare you know the new King James version puts it this way for your wondrous Works declare that your name is near you know we speak about and we sing about the name of the Lord but it should be more than just a casual phrase for us you know it's important that we understand these phrases and not allow them to become common you know the name of the Lord is a significant thing you know the scriptures say that he chooses where he puts his name not us you know it's not a magic spell or a power word that we apply to something that we're doing or saying and you you know suddenly there's power it's important to know the evidence of the name of the Lord you know we often say that where two or three are gathered in his name there he is in the midst that's true that's the word but Psalm 751 says that when his name is near his works not his words declare it that's right you know his Works will be present you know in other words there's an effect of his name you know his name isn't simply applied because we say it his name can be applied because his works are present you know it says where two or three are gathered in his name he is near it means his wondrous Works will declare it where his name is his work is being performed Jesus said that the works that I do shall ye do also Jesus taught that works fruits are identification ye shall know them by their fruits you know when the Jews did not believe the identity his identity when he provided his name he said in John 10:30 that I and the father are one he told the Jews in John 10:37 if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do the wondrous works though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him so when they did not believe his claim that he had come in his father's name he told them to examine the works because they were evidence of that name he told his disciples in John 14:11 believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake he told the Jews in John 5:17 my father worketh hither to and I work they were performing the same works the evidence of the name of the Lord is is that the works of the Lord are being performed yes you can't have one without the other so what are his wondrous Works remember when John the Baptist and John 1 he saw him and he declared his identity the name is an identity he declared his name he said and I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God you know and a son carries the name of the father and John declared his name this is the Son of God but but then just a year or two later he finds himself in a prison cell and he begins to question whether that was really true and he sent a couple of his disciples to Jesus to inquire whether he was still the son that that name was still present and what was the evidence that Jesus gave them he said in Matthew 11:4 Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached unto them the works of God you know and we have a tendency to become fixed on the physical manifestations of these things and he does do that blind can be healed those that cannot hear are healed but how many times do we step over or ignore how much that work is happening all around us because those who could not see can now see those who had no ear to hear can now hear those who were stumbling around in darkness and could find no way to walk were given a light for their path and steps and guidance to walk those who were lost in the Valley of the shadow of death have been called into newness of Life The Works of God only he can do those things you know his name is near when his wondrous works are being performed that's right you know the question is if we identify with his name whether it's a church service or our daily walk are his wondrous Works present this his name declared by my lips but his works are not found you know remember the Jews came to Jesus in John 6:28 and asked him what shall we do that we might work the works of God he told them in verse 29 this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he ha sent that's right and then for the next few verses they go back and forth trying to understand how they can be participants in the work of God and finally he settles on verse 40 and says and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son who is his name and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day the work of the father is to impart life to the effect of that name is the eye opening ear opening walk straightening life cleansing lifegiving work of God when his name is present so also is his work amen you know brother brandham spoke of the Believers writing another book of Acts that's right amen there's a reason it's called acts and not words his name is near when when his work is performed I think we can all say that we've been affected by the name of the Lord in some way if your eyes have ever been opened if you have ever been given an ear to hear if you've ever been called out of darkness and into his wonderful life we've been affected by his name but the question is if the name of the Lord is upon us is also his work being performed through us where Jesus said that you also would do the works that I do if we are one of the two or three that are gathered in his name is someone beginning to see is someone beginning to hear is some Life coming out of darkness and into light is somebody's walk beginning to change for that thy name is near thy wondrous Works declare let's go ahead and stand we'll read that short Psalm Psalm 75 this morning you know my prayer is that I don't just have his name but that his works are evident with that name let's go ahead and read that together Psalm 7 75 unto thee Oh God do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous Works declare when I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly the Earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved I bear up the pillars of it ca I said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for promotion cometh neither from the East nor from the West nor from the South but God is the judge he putteth down one and Seth up another for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he porth it out of the same but the drgs thereof all the wicked of the Earth shall ring them out and drink them but I will declare forever I will sing praises to the god of Jacob all the horns of the wicked also will I cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted amen amen God bless you maybe have your seats it's the whole time Holy Spirit and the devil longer near it that's the reason people oh it's good in our me oh give me that whole time

place that we were meant to live that we were created to live in Lord and we've dropped in this little space of time called life to be tested to be tried to manifest your attributes but father we will return to that eternal life which we've always had we just grant today this morning that you would guide us on our journey you would point the path that we are to travel that you would bring us to the door that that separates this Dimension from the other Lord that we could pass through back to where we come from Back To Where We Belong knowing you father face to face bear with us father in our weakness and our frailties continue to provide us grace and mercy that we might be whole help this morning we pray for we ask it in the blessed and holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you thank you musicians thank you everybody for being here this morning let's turn in our bibles if you would to uh the gospel of St John the 10th chapter and I want to read a uh starting with the 24th verse this morning it's nice to have uh Mike and Ellen parks with us this morning and any of our other visitors God bless you nice to be here where are you Mike and Ellen I don't see you there you are you're hiding behind Jonathan there okay good you know Michael uh is was extremely instrumental in us even getting this church that we're in now and because of that work it's grown to where we're building a little something a little more comfortable for us next store but I've always appreciated um what he did for our body here and probably it'll never go recognized but it was done in such a subtle beautiful way that you knew it was the Lord able to work us through and guide us through the financing and and everything just fell into place and and so we are where we are today we're all where we are today because of somebody else somebody helped us along the way and always remember to hold that person in a great respect because it makes the difference it's the people that forget for forget how they got to where they are and they become unappreciative those people will never have any character whatsoever and you know the only thing you're going to take with you you know what that is right it's your character amen everything else dissolves but who that you are let's read these scriptures this morning it says and uh he says the then the the Jews around about him the Jews around then came the Jews around about him and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly amen amen I mean what can you say you know it's like somebody looking at the prophet of God is saying if if thou be a prophet tell us plainly you know oh you are such and such you are such and set that person back there you you know but anyway that that's a whole another inspiration in itself and Jesus answered them I told you and you believe not The Works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me amen and I give un to them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and I and my father are one Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated beautiful scriptures amen um uh next weekend uh Saturday Saturday October 21st we're having an Outreach service here at the church at at 6: pm. and there'll be Refreshments following and that's just a service like that so you can invite if you have friends high school friends students work friends it's just a kind of an Outreach service where we give us an opportunity to invite people to church and that'll be uh Saturday uh brother Bryce Collins will be preaching for us and uh and then we'll have service Sunday morning at uh uh uh 10:00 uh so uh look forward to that next uh weekend amen so we want to do that certainly um tremendous times that we're living in wouldn't you say and uh the other day I I was fellowshipping uh brother Tim Siler called me and and was talking about a friend of mine uh David Morris who uh they found a br a mass on his brain and he was letting me keep him in prayer and he mentioned to me a tape that and called the countdown and my heart was drawn from it and and I was thinking quite a bit down the long lines of birth pains and and how a woman's in tvil and how we're in tvil and then I went and listened to the countdown um and it's a if I could say that it's a parallel sermon and it's it's trying to get the people to be able to recognize the events that are around them to recognize the day and its message to recognize the time that you're in and what's transpiring around you and things are trans trans spiring around us that are changing the atmosphere that we're living in and the doors are closing in on us and people's attitudes towards Christianity and to church are changing the the the way that they feel about uh the Lord and the things of the Lord have changed it's no longer important eternal life isn't important it's not something that's valued and when something is devalued then to it becomes useless and the word of God is useless to so many people today because the word of God doesn't help you stay here in this world it helps you to leave this world and that's what we're interested in doing we're interested in leaving the world and we know that this week and and uh I'm sure you're a breast of the news that there was a great conflict in Israel and there was a a great if I could say this a great uh War has broke out to the fact that they declared war and um and I I don't want to go into all those events of that but I do believe believe that we should pray for those people and uh it's uh it's a situation that has come about from uh thousands of years ago of man's decisions and they're paying the prices today and and they're arguing over the land and and you've got a people that according to the word of God we know of the great Holocaust when when uh Hitler and those angels that were that came those spirits of Destruction and they came and they begin to Massacre the Jews I believe it was 6 million I believe 6 million Jews they killed and they resolved in their heart right then that they were going to return back to the land that God gave them they went back to their prophets they opened the Old Testament they read their borders they read what was promised to them and they determined in their heart we're not going to let mankind extinguish us from the face of the Earth and they went back there and they went to that land and they went in there and they drove the inhabitants of that land back out that they could take possession of the land that they believed that go God had gave them and and because it was self-preservation to them they knew if they didn't return back to their home and back to the promises that God gave them back to the protection that they received under the promises of the scriptures that they would not survive as a people that's right and now they displaced people and and those people uh uh were driven out of the land and they were driven to different places they became enemies of the state of Israel and because Israel had taken from them what they thought was there I can sympathize with both sides I I I can't sympathize with Bloodshed and and different things that take place but I thought the prophet of God typed it to us he said we came in and took a lamb and displac the people and here we are and we're Are Spiritual people that live in a spiritual land we call it freedom of religion we call it the ability to worship our Lord the way that we choose fit and above all people we've been blessed because we've been elected and chosen God's opened our eyes and and and let us be able to see something and recognize that he was calling out a people and he was separating a people out of the land out of religion even out of the religious freedom that our country granted we came out of that we came out of the systems we came out of the organizations we we came out of the politics of it we came out of the money of it and we were a people that was called into the land of God's word and if we don't stay in that word we will not survive as a people because that's our only place of protections under the word of God and just as there was a great War this great war that broke out and we know the natural types the spiritual well we know that if there is a war against Natural Israel because the hour is at hand then we also know there's a spiritual war against the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and this this Great War and you talk about the war and and we know that uh I'll just read this little statement because I know that you all know it by heart but just to uh give it some if I could say that some uh a a little validity if I could say that says now now the natural all things spiritual all happenings and so forth uh so forth uh type the uh Supernatural all the natural is a type of the spiritual so when we see this great natural war going on we know that there's a spiritual war going on anytime the spiritual and the natural meet there's a conflict going on there's something that lies ahead for Israel like you know can I I I can explain to you all about the 144,000 I don't understand how how everything going to come to pass and I know we have great speculators and and great charts and everything uh I know that that's not my race to run but I know that that race will be run and they will come to the revelations that God wants them to come to and I believe with all my heart that when this uh uh tragedy uh struck those people that there's real sincere genuine people there that are beginning to call out on the Lord and when you call out unto the Lord God answers and I believe there's an answer coming to them I believe there's Revelations and things that's God's going to show I don't know if this is the time but I can tell you it's a start of the time and so anytime that there's a war going on there's also a spiritual war going on and I say this canot uh it's to our local body here and I okay Peter said it think it not strange at the fiery darts of the enemy you know think it think it not strange at the trying of your faith think it not strange and I want you to be aware think it not strange that things that you thought that you had overcome that the enemy is now going to start to bring up and war against you battles that you thought that you put away things that you thought were over things that you thought were resting at peace all of a sudden things are going to rise up because those things want to get back into the land that they feels theirs amen Satan used to dwell in you he used to have rule over you he used to control your heart your mind the things the desires of your heart and when the seed of God came out and possessed you and pushed those those things back he wants to lay claim to them because time's running out for him and and and you're an adversary to his kingdom you're the voice against what he's trying to do you're the voice against the world and the things of the world you're the voice against the religious system you're the voice against the false doctrines the brides the voice in the last day she's crying out and and and and by her lifestyle by the way she dresses the way she conducts herself she she's a living protest amen that's what we used to be we used to be Protestants uhuh we protested the the air of the supremacy of the nickol Adan system over the people we stood against that that that's not what we moved under we moved under the freedom of the Holy Spirit and and if your lives if you're living there and you're living under that that Grace a and under the leadership of the Holy Spirit you you don't even mean to do it but you walk into a place and and you bring the the people of the the surroundings under conviction without saying a word this is spiritual warfare and wickedness in high places you could just just by being a real Spirit-filled Christian you should be able to create an atmosphere around you of peace and of Love A a friendship of of you're not at War you're at rest so much should that be your nature that people inquire of you what makes you so happy in the midst of the storm what makes you so sure of yourself H how do you you know why why aren't you mad over here the workplace all these the bosses treating us bad and you show up to work every day and you just work hard how come you're not arguing with everything they should inquire of you so you can give them and you should have an answer in your heart you should have an answer in your heart cuz I've come to peace I've got to I've got a guide I've got someone that's that's leading me and guiding me I've come to rest I know where I'm going no matter what this what happens in this Earth this isn't my home one day I'll be resurrect resurrected one day I'm going to rise up one one day I'm going home and and let me tell you why I'm happy because I believe it soon soon and very soon I believe it with all my heart all the signs are pointing to it so if if if you've got a people that's getting ready to leave and you know because Satan knows the word of God if these people leave his days are numbered you don't think he's going to war against you you don't think he's going to try to keep you from reaching the achievement cuz there is an achievement for the bride there's something that's given to us to achieve and that's what we're after we're after our achievement this morning what's our achievement the achievement of the bride and so we know that that we're on a path to achieve something and you know how did you know on this great natural typing the spiritual how how did they they come in well they they infiltrated amen amen they said there was an intelligence breakdown you know people started missing the signs that's right they became at rest they they forgot that there there's Satan like a roaring line going about if if the person knew the strong man of the house knew that the thief was coming he'd make preparation and so what we're saying is is is we know he's coming amen I I oh brother McGary preach us all delivered I'd love to come this morning and preach everybody all delivered you understand but if if we we know he's going to attack us we know he's going to hit us from every way he can we know he's going to try to Snuff our voice out again this is not a time for us to be cowards it's a time to light our candles and set it on the hillside and stand for what we believe cuz somebody you may not know but your written Epistles somebody's reading your life you have effect on people that nobody else can have effect on God placed you where you are for a reason for you to make contact he designed your life that you might come in contact with another seed because Faith cometh Faith to Faith hearing to hearing that's how the gospel spread it's spread by personal contact so never doubt the importance of your life and this great infiltration that takes place and you've got to be aware he he's trying to infiltrate our lives that he can set the bomb off later and we've talked about these things thinking men's filter filtering everything out making sure you know what I mean pray for Revelation so this morning when brother Tim mentioned the countdown to me I went and listened into 1962 and there it's called countdown and there's some tremendous statements that are made here so I'd like to play 30 minutes of it this morning and and as brother Rim talks about the natural progressing he as as man made a scientific achievement God was making a spiritual achievement and he talks about horse and buggy he talks about and we're going to pick it up kind of further in to the message and that uh we might be able to grasp 30 minutes a little bit about what is happening and there is a countdown on this these events that you are seeing are part of the prophecies that are for told to come to pass amen you know the world is pressing our country into coming to some sort of compromise on Israel that's right and the our messenger told us when the United States reject rejects Israel and turns her back on Israel she's finished so there's little teeny things that are holding this whole thing together and those things are starting to come undone if if yeah you you know we're all good we're homeschooling now a lot of us we found good schools for our kids but they're coming if it's happening a thousand miles away amen don't think it's slowly creeping we say we got the great state of Texas but there's thousands of people with a completely different mindset moving in I know when I first moved to Texas that we didn't there wasn't a store open on Sunday you couldn't sell alcohol you couldn't sell cigarettes you couldn't only restaurants could open after at afternoon they call them blue light laws I believe it was or blue laws you know what I mean they were all laws to preserve Sunday to keep God in the our lives and God in our States now lesie and I drove down the road the other day okay and and our kids played Little League ball and I'm not against that or whatever sport I I've never uh I felt that that's a a home decision not a Church decision and we we didn't have practice on Wednesday nights or Sundays game games or nothing now we would go down the road the other day and they're all out there playing ball on Sunday right why cuz more people don't go to church now than go to church and he said when they no longer wish to retain God in their knowledge God gives them over to a reprobate mind how far will a reprobate mind go all you have to do is look just cross over on the west coast and see what they're doing with their children see what they're teaching in school see how they're taking children over trying to teach them that they can be whatever they want to be some kid decided he identified as a cat so they're making Provisions for him so he can meow that's human beings that's human beings that's lost their mind so don't think it's not coming the countdown's on and so we're going to listen to this uh 30 minutes and then we'll do I figured if I talk 30 minutes play 30 minutes and talk 15 minutes it would only be an hour I identify with a different math than you do as we prepare to read this this is paragraph 65 out of the countdown 1962 he said but there was a people who achieved it that's what we're talking this morning about our achievement the achievement of the Bride but there was a people who achieved it Hallelujah you see where I'm getting to there was was somebody know what justification meant in the sight of God they knew what justification meant in the sight of God do you know what justification means in the sight of God do you know what sanctification means in the sight of God do you know what restoration of the gifts means in the sight of God do you know what the elected bride age means in the sight of God not in the sight of man but in the sight of God having peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen there was some of those lutherans who were loyal they believed it no matter what the Catholic Church said they believed God's word and stood on it because the messenger of that age preached the J shall live by faith and they believ in a Justified State they were able by grace of God to achieve justification have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ think if that's justification that's horse and buggy what is our achievement it isn't sitting on a bench waiting for the train to come now we notice again Along Came the Methodist with sanctification there was many of those methodists was actually Sanctified now there's a lot of them claim it and know nothing about it the Methodist Church taught sanctification they said they got down and cried out and got back up and said glory to God I'm Sanctified and they went right on living like they always did but some of those man and woman actually Sanctified from the things of the world and lived a consecrated set aside life why that was the automobile age which took in more horsepower automobile in the old t- model was probably 15 or 20 horsepower see and 15 or 20 horse bottled up in a little engine like sanctification and now listen to this when science achieve something by by the natural God is achieving something by the spiritual see some things going on all the time then after the sanctification age so and then we're going to pick up where brother Bram says now Pentecost how much is happening in the scientific age around us so if there's a natural achievement there's a spiritual achievement and as I said last Wednesday if the world is decaying and becoming morally corrupt as fast as they are we should be growing spiritually stronger also so we should be going up as fast as they're going down that's right that's right so we need to press to the achievement that we're pressing to and I'm going to read this a little statement you'll hear it a second as we prepare to play and this is the theme I want you to grab a hold of as we listen I or I want to grab a hold of you grab a hold of what the Lord lays on your heart now why did these men do this why did Luther find it why did Wesley find it why did these others because the material was laying here on Earth that could make the model te4 okay now listen to this this is 1962 there was electricity that could make a car to run amen electric cars weren't even around the man says things that are unbelievable if you have ear to here let's just listen to 30 minutes thinking on the achievement thinking on the progress thinking at the materials here the materials here for you to be everything that God said this bride would be would you listen with me for uh uh just 30 minutes I I feel it's important if you have any confidence in me at all um please uh listen this morning God bless you and then Al come Pentecost and as science of the world was able to achieve a a automobile motor the right brothers that created or made manufactured brother the airplane the Flying Machine was far above the car on the Earth because he tuck to the air now the right Brothers through their achievement was able to take signs and pattern something here on Earth to show that there was a great spiritual thing fixing to happen I when the right Brothers was able to achieve to get a man's feet off the ground Pentecost fell and tck to the air with the spirit Hallelujah but the baptism of the Holy ghost it tuck to the air oh got his feet off the ground so he just swim around Hallelujah got up in the air oh how far he was above the horse and buggy how far he was above the automobile he was up in the air he was knocking and puffing and banging but he was flying see what man achieves on Earth for they made of things which do not appear God was able to achieve something by a spirit filled people who were hungering and thirsting and those that would stay with the word hallelu now if Wesley had to stepped out on the word and got a bad name behind him was called a crazy man and everything else he'd have never been able to achieve but Wesley was one of God's Great scientists amen Luther was one of God's Great scientists they didn't care what the churches said what the organization said Luther didn't care what the Catholics said he believe that Just sh live by faith Hallelujah and he took God's chemicals of the word and put it together and the church moved by faith he put it together by the blood improved it by the blood and the church got Sanctified Hallelujah the Pentecostals believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the promises of you your children in them as far off and they put the chicles together of the word and they moved into the air Hallelujah they moved out because they were able to be able to accomplish such now why did these men do this why did Luther find it why did Wesley find it why did these others because the material was laying here on Earth that could make a key model form there was electricity that could make a a car to run there was gasing in the earth there was uh pist thingss and so forth all the mechanics carbon for the generator and everything they had to have to create this stuff and notice it started a manufactured rather not created God the created amen he had it laying here but man who believ it in the scientific real of the natural Pro into it and they wouldn't take no for an answer they believed it it was a revelation in their heart and they stay with it until they prove that it was that's how that John Wesley proved sanctification the material was laying here the word of God that no matter if the whole church the angle and church and all turning down he stayed with this conviction amen and he proved it and the Pentecostals come around and prove because they had the material that the Holy Ghost was right and they tuck to the air did you notice one one of those scientific achievement accomplished the other one complimented the other one it was only a higher form see the automobile was a higher form of trans Transportation than the horse and the airplane was a higher form of transportation than the automobile but they accompanied one another horsepower amen if that's horsepower what about God power what about the Holy oan power holy ghost power that can justify you the same holy ghost power can sanctify the same holy ghost power that sanctifies you can fill you with this Pres Hallelujah and little science that didn't know their ABCs found it w they were spiritual scientists amen they seen the thing they believed it man did it by education the natural scientist the spiritual scientists done it by Revelation one by education the other by Revelation oh if we just open up there's all kinds of material laying here amen that's right now we notice how it goes how God was able to achieve that in the Pentecostals taken to the air how they then was restored back to the church healing speaking in tongues Revelation gifts of the Spirit let Luther know nothing about neither did Wesley they never taught it they know nothing about it because out of their age while what would Henry know about an airplane in them days before the right Brothers it wouldn't have noted and the same thing that the man back there driving a horse and buggy 500 years ago wouldn't know nothing about a Hess Carriage only the Bible said it would be there so they was able to achieve it by scientific research and when it happened on Earth God represented with a achievement by his church for things which are do appear was made of things that does not hereall a reflection of it now now the Pentecostal age for the last 50 years has sent a Revival around the world with all kinds of everything in it and they've had healings um sickness being healed cripples healed BL had their sight restored to them do you think the world believe it no sir they didn't believe Luther they didn't believe Wesson they didn't believe the Pentecostal but God took the Bible in his research a man who was willing to do it took the Bible and proved to it that it was right amen now we got to remember that we got to believe it seeing those things were time now we've lived up the Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age that I Prov it over there goes out into the lady of sin age amen but now something else has happened we got an astronaut now John Glenn was our first astronaut and we find out that that's so far Bey of an airplane airplane can only go as far as his pressure and so forth but this is by an atomic power a greater power that presses him so much higher than an airplane airplane even even isn't in it right he's been able to do that all right now we got an astronaut natural age and remember the messenger comes at the end of the former messenger always we proed that there now we're on the astronaut line amen God God has science has been able to prove that there's an astronaut that can go so far till you couldn't see with your natural eyes and if can go where there's any pressure there or not he can just go on out because in a pressure tank and he can go up there and sail around and see the world around an astronaut oh my what the AIDS of that is coming yes sir go beyond any natural things at all sweet come on what does it represent a spiritual age a spiritual time the word God's going to have spiritual astronaut hallelu amen the right now H the Eagles of the air that can go beyond any other ver sail above everything spiritual astronauts Glory that can take the word of God and prove that he's the same a spiritual astronaut oh my glory that makes me feel good even in this age now what a wonderful think for a spiritual astronaut see what is it what did the Natural Science do has been able to achieve that and God through man who would stay with the Bible and say that he's the same yesterday day and forever and not afraid of the promise regardless of what anybody said stay with it amen what is it you becoming an astronaut that can go so far as Beyond denominational think amen not anything else the things of the church him alone youut praise Lord and remember in order to get be an astronaut they had to get in a tank and they can't control themselves it takes a radar power and atomic power to lift him out beyond space and that is controlled by Tower Glory God's spiritual astronauts is the same they come into a tank into a place into a body amen that body is the body of Christ then it's not them it's not wasn't John Glenn was it was the tank that he was in it was the machine he just sat there he didn't do nothing he just had the real pure courage to get up there and say it's right because science had proved it amen God wants man who can come into Christ and believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever don't take your own move out into space controlled by the Holy Ghost astronauts hallelujah how far it is back from the old horse and bu how far it is even from the airplan how far it is from justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost there are com the Eagles the first they were lizards then they become chickens then they become crows but now they're Eagles no one can follow them a eagle is a special bird he can go higher than any other bird he's prepared to se keep his head level when he gets up there and some people jump with don't know where they're at they get there because he can't see no further than what he's jump but there's some that can look back and see what's going on that's the eagle he can stand there till he looks it over and waits till he hears a message that tells him what to say that's the astronaut of God it's followed all the other achievements why want it follow this achievement astronauts for Jesus don't even leave by his own power he's fired out does is get into it that's all you have to do is get into it I don't do the shooting and the placing it ain't gasoline power no more neither some church creep it's God's Adam power that pushes to come out of space amen hallelujah oh W what is it these astronauts they've got the they never need just tuck the word justification just the word sanctification he's got into the whole Bible amen amen he's got it all of it because that he knows that God is able to perform every promise he ever made amen he just sits there amen and waits oh my the words bound to manifest itself amen if you're sick and an astronaut just remember get in Christ wait the countdown he'll fire the bullet don't worry huh been able to achieve it because God promised him now how much greater is the astronaut these things now from the old horsepower automobile power and um and the uh airplane power you see the astronaut he's so high that he can see things that a man in a horse and buggy couldn't see amen he's so high he can see things that a man in automobile couldn't see amen he's so high that he can see things the man find an airplane can can see he's done went pum out of [Music] reason that went beyond any achievement man could think of the organization the denomination had to be Methodist this the on T whatever it he's an astronaut say amen how thankful I am and remember the astronaut is controlled by a radar power you seen him bring John Glenn in I look down there at Cape ralo and seen that great big radar thing you couldn't even see him nowhere but you could tell where he was by the way that radar was pointing that's where he was at see and we got a radar to prayer prayer is a radar power that directs the astronaut ask the father anything in my name I'll do it just watch the way the prayer it's going you see where he's pointing just watch the way the churches are praying you can see the way the missiles are flying you tell it by the way the astronauts are traveling by the way the church is praying he prays Lord of course we don't believe in these things uhuh that astronaut's coming down that's oh brother but when all things are possible Lord pour out your spirit upon the church and give it what we have need pour upon us the Holy Ghost and just take us out of every reason and believe it that word right when we're standing right by watch the screen then begin to raise its head like this the astronaut's going onall way up in there wonderful goes beyond any denomination goes beyond any Creed I remember justification is lotted to a Creed that's right you leave justification like some more like the Lutheran and any of their satellites that's what they are satellite but the an't off the ground you take U sanctification and there're satellites say what is the satellites to the Lutheran well Church of Christ that Bunch there what is the satellites to the Wesley to the Methodist like a Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness their satellites and then the Pentecostal and their satellites the airplane sure the one that's two in the street and for sou all these Four Square Church of God all still created a denomination but the astronaut breaks the sound barrier you don't hear nothing oh my this goes beyond all of it he's way up in there for all things he's living in the presence of God that'sall he promised it his word says that he's the high priest you see that great big radar sitting out there moving watch him in the meeting you can watch when the Holy Spirit comes down in a form of a pillar of far I he promise a man's not going be sitting there trying to reason out with science a real believer what is he he's a radar screen watch him he begins to point around amen amen and it catches that one there that asona oh you have cancer you had so and so you were so and so from such a place the Lord Jesus make you well Hall astronauts oh my what a church it's to be it's here the achievement's been proved Bes science they shorted out the World's Fair we got it amen it's proved every word astrona age we're living in see is made of things which do not appear see it was made of something out of Heaven it's God himself you're in that sixth Dimension it's the power of God we've been in such a place so we have been lifted up into that Dimension Beyond this thing of going to the grave and weeping this thing of putting the crepe on the door not and saying goodbye forever Hallelujah we done got in the astronaut and sailed off out there she more that return back going to the home beyond the sky beyond the reasoning of man how the old will be transformed in a moment of TRN we shall see him there old man and women young again how do you know the Bible teaches it and God shot an astronaut up in there we know what it's all about come back no worry about dying dying's nothing sure it's living yes sir it's just get your feet off the ground so he can go oh how wonderful he's promised all these things in his word or Hebrews 138 said he's the same yesterday today and forever the things that he was able God could achieve by one man who would surrender himself to to the word of God because as I said last night he always stood with the word now you know well astronauts is really no new thing what about Elijah if he was an astronaut I'd ever seen one he went where John Glenn never did think about going well you know they had one tuck off in slow motion one time his name was Enoch he just walked on him but he was an astronaut sure he was pressurized he didn't have to be changed nothing no he was already pressurized when he started walking just walked right on out of all the dimensions and everything walked out in the presence of God and so one old fell was tired and couldn't walk very good anymore he fuss with Jazzy Bell and her short hair and paint and everything until God to send a charot down let's let you ride up through the one time one come to die for the rest of us and God raised him up on a third day and and 500 man stood there and see him being taken up into the cloud with a voice saying I will come again the same Jesus that was taken up the master astronaut will return again in Black manner in the same kind of a apartment that is in a body in marle Hallelujah glory and we all have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is oh Hallelujah he broke all the sound barriers all all the reasoning barriers went beyond reasoning went beyond anything else and any man that ever lives for God will have to go beyond any five senses it'll have to go any education any achievement that man's been able to do and believe God take everything side to sweep up into the heavens amen oh what astronauts and so forth has been achieved in the natural God's been able to do it by his church by the spiritual by a spiritual people who will believe any man or woman who will dare at any time anytime to take God at his word it's an astronaut they'll say oh that isn't reasonable hear those people crying shouting hear this oh that's not even reasonable that doesn't understand somebody told me said you had a dream brother brandom when you seen that play I never had no dream I was standing up there looking down where L on the bed I might have been dreaming on the bed but I was up here looking down at myself oh he just gave me a little astronaut ride that morning that's word go and it shows that your radar will point it out exactly where it's at that it isn't me it's him it's your spirit in you believing that message and it's the Holy Ghost standing here where I'm at and you believe it like that and it contacts and here it comes right back your answer as amen oh how wonderful yes sir great science has done a great thing and you know they've done it so great until they're getting scared of themselves yeah that's right they got so much greatness so they're afraid of themselves you know they said here about 2 years ago it was 3 minutes before midnight they that when Russia ever starts to blow this country up or some other country he's going to saay off to the Moon I seen a little cuest thing the other day it really was cute there was two little Indians standing talking to one another little pot bellies you know like that a feather up behind the head shaking one other's hands Pat one another said Brut we'll soon have the country back to herself white man's going to the [Laughter] Moon that we'll soon have our country back again white man's going to over on the moon so we'll have our own country it's all right oh now there were all want to make a whole lot of these astronaut cans so they get into it and the atomic age comes they go to bus up the world they just pull this and all go over on the moon taking a trip to the moon and have it all over with so they'll just make them another economy on the moon ain't going to get there don't believe with all my heart till ever get there see but at the same time the real True Believer in Christ has entered his astronaut amen by one Spirit we're all baptized into one astronaut oh one body they can stand any any kind of pressure they' tried it in a fire furnace and stand fire so it can't burn up seven times hotter they tried it everything comes out all right so the spiritual scientists been able to prove that he can stand anything so the the real spiritual believer has accompanied himself and got into God's astronaut Christ believing all things laying aside his Creeds the Pentecostal Creeds the Baptist Creeds the Methodist Creeds he's just got into the astronaut than Lord On's it ready oh my what's he doing he's coming to little meetings listening to the countdown of God's word you know when John Glenn sat there that morning let's listen to the countdown 109 87 65 4 3 2 1 0 see and now he's got to a spot where he says just three minutes till something's going to take off they don't know what it is 3 minutes until we have the Zero Hour now notice the real believer is in Christ no condemnation to them that's in Christ preach the word stay right with the word I don't care what the denominations say they're going to believe it they'll stand right there because it's a word the denomination kick up a big fuss and excommunicate them run them out and say they're crazy everything like that but they stay right with that word as long as God promised it they stay there because they're astronauts they believe the word and there's no way to get rid of them they're going to leave you any house just just let them alone a while but they're in there setting in Heavenly places amen in Christ Jesus listening to the countdown the church ages and so forth Glory makes you feel good don't listening to the countdown what's the countdown all these things is Promised here's what happened all these things have promised here's where happening where promis this here's where happening the achievement he promised today here is Right Among Us what are they doing listening to the countdown how far has it come all the way from Luther the countdown justification sanctification 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 wh what are they doing waiting for the takeoff the Zero Hour amen this great arbiton that the church is getting ready to do and the great time of the countdown I'd like to explain to you what I think the countdown is I think we just been through it in the church here and now you notice that when the natural astronaut is getting ready to leave the Earth there is a countdown starting from 10 back to zero I haven't tried to break this message down and give it his spirit spiritual application as it would take too much time this morning but I want to try to explain this to you that 10 is a number of worldliness man but seven is the number of God's Perfection six days he made the heavens and earth and the seventh he rested and 6,000 years the world is to labor against sin or the church labor against sin and the seventh is the Millennium the Sabbath seven is God's perfect number and now he has given us the correct countdown and his countdown is not 10 but seven right we've just been through it in the seven Church ages now we find out and over in Revelations the first countdown was the first age the second countdown the second age and on to the seventh countdown and here visible before since the pictures drawn that we had this Countdown the first number counted was Ephesus the second number County was Samaria Samaria then pergamus thyra fifth was sarus sixth was Philadelphia and seventh was the lady o the last Church age then it's the uh zero time for the church to leave after the church ages has served their term now we know the fatara age has come and gone and the Ephesian age has coming gone the Philadelphian age is coming gone and we are in the seventh Church age at the end of it the lady oan age and that is the countdown if you Noti in our previous lessons of the churches he held in his hand Seven Stars which we found to be seven Ministers of the seven Church ages each one of them is perfectly identified as God took his countdown since the time he left until the time he comes back he's gathering together a people for his name sake amen amen started at the day of Pentecost the first the Ephesian Church the star and messenger of that church we believe to be St Paul he has come and number one has been counted off the second Church age which is Samia was irenius the great saint of God who led that church age at the end the Third Church age which was pergamus was St Columbia which was was a great saint of God during the time of the Dark Age and the persecution the fourth age and the fourth count St Martin of taurus the great Saint coming from France the fifth Church age and its messenger was Martin Luther on the countdown the sixth age was John Wesley on the countdown now we're in the seventh age the lady of sin Church age and we are looking for that great messenger of the second appearing of Elijah on the countdown and as soon as that appears then it's zero time and the church takes its way home goes out into space into the heavens all Beyond moon stars everything else and meet Jesus where did this come from and where did they go into this astronaut how did the people get into the astronaut at the first place that's the way they'll have to get into it in every place every time that's right have to come in by the same way the first did because this great orbit of a great body of people there in Noah's time there was only one door and that door was the only door of entrance everything that come in no matter if they went to the first floor under justification second floor or third floor they all come in at one door amen they all come in the same way and we can certainly go on but I hope that inspired you this morning amen about uh it's about achievement and what can we achieve if and of course you know that was a segment that brother brandham came in uh there and uh I I think you saw the note it says later brother Bram uh put this from paragraph 106 through 11 he explained it dear in his sermon but what is he telling us he's telling us that that this is this great age that we're living in and it's it's there in other words we talk a lot about the power of the church we talk about you know signs and wonders but he said it's there for every believer it's here because the materials there well where is our material we have the message of the hour we have all everything in there that we need to achieve you know I I like that he said they they they achieved to where they got scared of themselves don't be a scared of yourself don't look at yourself and say I'm I'm doing this you're not doing it it's him in you doing it it's the age that you've been created for it's the power that God's given you to do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think by faith we just need to rise up into that great astronaut age we need to start taking hold of our achievement because we can't be afraid we can't be afraid to go forward we're not going back we're not trying to go back and and and eat on a day gone by because it was higher than the day before you know mean you kind of get high he said it takes courage for the believer to step not out just by uh just by what they've experienced amen but to step into the unknown by the power of the promise that's what the astronaut does is by the power of the promise that he moves by the word of God he sees it in the word of God how many in the word of God sees an elect lady a chosen people am and that and that you can lay hold of it and say I'm part of that it's given to me I I've been called I have a a calling in my heart I've been made and created to sail into the place where I can take the word of God not by organization not by Creed but by the the promise that was given me by God that I can fly into a spiritual achievement and be led by the spirit of God filled with the Holy Ghost filled with the promises of God with the ability to achieve the promises of the words that were given to me to be an overcomer and to fly off of this Earth doesn't that make you happy amen if the musicians would come this morning uh I I I just en I I just enjoyed that this morning amen how that the believer can achieve how they can achieve it by the word of God how that the material is here for us to achieve by so can you just ask yourself are are are you living below so somebody had to become dissatisfied with riding on that horse you know they got to finally say Hey you know we had people that did they didn't want to advance they thought the automobile was the world and and they they just weren't going to ride them you know what I mean and and they tried to stay where they're at and they tried to hold the spirit of of of sanctification but God's pulling us beyond that he's pulling you beyond your own reasoning he's pulling you beyond your own comfort zone right he's pulling you right now he's trying to pull you I'm going to sing something a whole lot better faster I'm going to say ready to leave so you can play soft till we sing that but I want to say what I want to say Amen there's something in you pulling you to hire you understand I mean you're driving around in an automobile you're flying around in an airplane he said that was Pentecost up in the air in the spiritual Realms working gifts and that's great I have nothing against that right you know what I mean if if you could fly to the moon as an astronaut or drive to the Moon or take an airplane but the airplane won't get you there that's right right it's okay if you want to go back and have the restoration of gifts any if any of you feel you have the gift of tongues beautiful the gift of Prophecy we're we're for it don't don't let anybody tell you I just want it to be [Music] real I want it to come with interpretation I want it to come with a message not just edification if you got spiritual gifts and you want to meet let me know we'll set aside a time before the [Music] preaching but I'm just trying to tell you that that plane won't make it it's going to take something more more than that it's going to take something that's so individually alive in you that you actually within your heart understand and know that you can step from this Dimension into that other world you believe so much in the Rapture you believe so much in the the change of the church you believe so much in the coming of the Lord to that door that's been provided cuz they all come through one door every single one of them came to the same door now you've got to come to that place where you know I am prepared I am ready am to leave and if if you're not it's not over because you're still here and you still got a chance and you can start making the adjustments to get ready you can start preparing yourself you can start reaching out for that astronaut thinking every single one of those guys had to leave the thinking of the other age behind you can't take this message and put on a denominational thinking a a Pentecostal thinking a Methodist thinking I know people that only thing they get out of the message is sanctification I sat under it for for four years all all I heard about was shoes and dresses and hair couldn't wear a leather purse you know what I mean couldn't couldn't do this couldn't have this and and cuz all they all they ever got out of the message was sanctification they couldn't go no higher then that there was people that could all all they could get out of the message was was uh the works that I do shall you do also and all they wanted to do is where's the church's power where where's the church's healing where's this where's that and that's all you heard it was always it was always make you feel bad then then offer you Deliverance prove that you're a sinner and then offer you a chance to the altar I'm trying to tell you Church there's astronauts people that know I come from God I go to God I am the word seed of God for this age I am mature in his word I accept his word I know it's true and not true in itself but true in me the word is true in me the word is in me and then you can look at this old wretched flesh that you are and from the inside say to your flesh oh flesh I'm bringing you under subjection Hall the astronaut in you can look at this shell and say shell I'm going to pressurize you I'm going to bring bring you subject to the word of God I'm not going to let you keep me from flying any higher hey amen I have power over you he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world and you can start you don't put condemnation on yourself you say there's a blood that forgiven me of my shortcoming there's a grace and mercy that's giv me the power to overcome because in this age is given to the Overcomer to fly out of this age and go into a higher place
