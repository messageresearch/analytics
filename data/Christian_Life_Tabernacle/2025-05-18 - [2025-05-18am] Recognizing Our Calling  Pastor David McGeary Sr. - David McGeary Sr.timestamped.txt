[54:56] Jesus tore his gospel
[55:00] 5,000 faithful
[55:03] souls who stayed and
[55:06] listened all day long to every word he
[55:11] spoke.
[55:14] Jesus sought to feed them all, but his
[55:19] disciples
[55:21] said, "There's only two small fishes
[55:26] here and five loaves of bread."
[55:34] With
[55:35] Jesus, nothing is impossible.
[55:42] We can build on a single drop of
[55:50] faith. And with
[55:53] Jesus, all the good we ever
[55:59] do can
[56:02] provide in countless ways.
[56:09] No
[56:10] matter how
[56:13] small our efforts may
[56:18] be, Jesus can make
[56:22] them great.
[56:27] [Music]
[56:33] Jesus and broke the bread. The meager
[56:37] portion
[56:39] grew. The people ate till they were
[56:44] filled. And there was extra
[56:48] food. So when you think it can't be
[56:53] done, it's worth
[56:57] remembering. Together, you and Jesus can
[57:03] accomplish
[57:05] [Music]
[57:09] anything.
[57:11] Jesus, nothing is
[57:17] impossible. He can build on a single
[57:22] drop of faith.
[57:27] with
[57:29] Jesus. All the good he ever
[57:35] do can be
[57:38] multiply in countless ways.
[57:43] [Music]

[1:07:06] sister, so much. Amen. Well, it's nice
[1:07:10] to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:07:11] morning. Uh thank you musicians so much
[1:07:15] this morning. Um um we're we're just
[1:07:19] grateful to today was our last Sunday
[1:07:21] school uh for the summer. So, uh our
[1:07:26] Sunday school teachers get a break. So,
[1:07:29] uh, some of you are going to have to
[1:07:30] start watching your children a little
[1:07:32] longer. Uh, so, uh, we do that. This is
[1:07:36] getting to be vacation season. So, uh,
[1:07:39] again, we just wanted to meet with
[1:07:41] anybody that plays an instrument, would
[1:07:43] like to play an instrument, would like
[1:07:45] to help us if you just stop by right
[1:07:48] after service to let let us know. Amen.
[1:07:55] um this morning. Um we know that when we
[1:08:00] started this year that um the desire of
[1:08:04] our heart and what was put on our heart
[1:08:08] is what is our path
[1:08:11] forward? In other words, we've we've
[1:08:14] come a long way. We've we've been on a a
[1:08:17] long journey. It's been uh uh years that
[1:08:22] we've been in the word of God and we've
[1:08:25] watched the word of God grow o over the
[1:08:29] years as it's been revealed to us, as
[1:08:31] it's been opened up to us. And we
[1:08:34] believe that God's got a great plan for
[1:08:36] its church. And the church has a great
[1:08:39] victory ahead of it. And we want to be a
[1:08:43] part of that. And we want to find the
[1:08:45] the part of that. And so we, you know,
[1:08:48] we've uh we've come down the uh the the
[1:08:55] road quite a ways from when I first came
[1:08:58] into the message. The only thing that we
[1:09:00] knew when the the only revelation we had
[1:09:05] was that Malachi 4:5 was fulfilled.
[1:09:09] That's all we knew. that God sent a
[1:09:12] prophet and that prophet was supposed to
[1:09:14] come before the great and dreadful day
[1:09:16] of the Lord and and we were in the Sodom
[1:09:20] time and it and uh and this was it. This
[1:09:26] was the forerunner for the we never even
[1:09:29] knew that we had a part in the plan. We
[1:09:32] never even understood the perfection
[1:09:34] that God wanted to bring us to the
[1:09:37] things that he wanted to show us. the
[1:09:39] things he wanted us to understand that
[1:09:43] he wanted to have fellowship with us and
[1:09:46] he wanted us to realize that we were his
[1:09:49] children and
[1:09:53] and now we've we've come to a place
[1:09:56] where uh I think the Lord really wants
[1:09:59] us to latch a hold of and
[1:10:03] understand our election and our calling
[1:10:08] and Uh uh if I you know if I uh had a
[1:10:13] title for this I I'm I I want to play a
[1:10:17] a a portion of the the message this
[1:10:21] morning. I think I left it in on my desk
[1:10:24] but no here it is. Uh but I I'd like it
[1:10:27] to kind of be titled or the thought that
[1:10:30] I want us to get in our mind is you know
[1:10:33] recognizing our calling. you know,
[1:10:36] understanding how that God called us and
[1:10:41] and the way that he went about doing it
[1:10:45] and uh what what it was that uh the
[1:10:50] power of God to us is. And you know a
[1:10:53] lot of questions and a lot of uh
[1:10:57] uh focus has been put on on you know
[1:11:02] being born again. You know being born
[1:11:05] again and uh and I wanted to play
[1:11:09] something this morning to you uh 30
[1:11:13] minutes out of the message Easter Seal.
[1:11:16] Well you say that's a that's a
[1:11:19] a Easter message. know Easter's every
[1:11:23] day for us. Amen. It's the
[1:11:27] resurrection. And so when we talk about
[1:11:31] uh what is the Holy Spirit, you know,
[1:11:34] what is mean to be born again? What does
[1:11:38] it mean? And the scripture tells us in
[1:11:41] Romans the 8th chapter and it says, "But
[1:11:45] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:11:49] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[1:11:54] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:11:56] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:12:00] his spirit that dwelleth in you." Now,
[1:12:04] the spirit that was in Jesus that rose
[1:12:08] him from the
[1:12:10] dead, that is the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:15] That is the Holy Spirit. It is the
[1:12:18] spirit of
[1:12:20] God. And that is promised to
[1:12:26] us. You understand? And I we're going to
[1:12:29] we're going to play this 30 minutes then
[1:12:32] just touch on a few aspects of it. But
[1:12:35] that is God's gift to us. Eternal life
[1:12:39] is God's gift to
[1:12:42] us. Every obstacle was mo moved out of
[1:12:46] the way. And so the spirit of God is the
[1:12:50] Holy Spirit. It's not a third person of
[1:12:53] the trinity. It's not like an anointing.
[1:12:57] It's when a life that you don't possess
[1:13:02] as a human being finds you
[1:13:06] and then takes and dwells in
[1:13:11] you. Now you have within you his spirit.
[1:13:16] Are you still in this flesh?
[1:13:19] Yes. Are have you already been raptured?
[1:13:26] The question would be, well, if you have
[1:13:30] the spirit in you, it will quicken your
[1:13:34] mortal body. So, the prophet of God's
[1:13:37] going to use the word
[1:13:40] potential because he wants you to
[1:13:42] understand
[1:13:43] that. He wants you to understand this
[1:13:46] gift of God, the spirit of God, the same
[1:13:50] spirit that raised him up that he sent
[1:13:54] back to you. Now, you didn't seek it. It
[1:13:58] sought you.
[1:14:01] It found you. He He There was something
[1:14:05] in you that he put there. And then the
[1:14:08] spirit began to move out. And he's going
[1:14:11] to I'm saying the things that you're
[1:14:13] going to hear him say because I want it
[1:14:15] to settle in your heart is that he said
[1:14:19] it was like the eagle that went looking
[1:14:21] for its lost uh its lost uh child. The
[1:14:26] he knew it had an egg. It knew it it
[1:14:29] laid two eigllets and one was missing.
[1:14:32] So it went searching for it. That's what
[1:14:34] the Holy Spirit was. It was like the
[1:14:36] eagle searching for all that it was
[1:14:40] there. And then when it found
[1:14:42] you, it called to
[1:14:46] you and you responded to that
[1:14:50] call because there was something in you
[1:14:53] to respond to that call. And then you
[1:14:57] begin to see that you're a part of a
[1:15:00] plan. You're part of a calling. you're
[1:15:04] part of the will of God. This is the way
[1:15:06] he chose it. He'll also talk about a
[1:15:09] magnet, how that there was a great steel
[1:15:12] and and when the uh the
[1:15:16] uh uh after they were done working all
[1:15:19] day long and the little trimmings fell
[1:15:22] on the ground, a great magnet swept
[1:15:25] across the ground and everything that
[1:15:27] was magnetized to it uh was taken up and
[1:15:31] everything that wasn't magnetized to it
[1:15:33] was left alone. and and and then you
[1:15:37] begin to see that that you were
[1:15:40] magnetized to this. You were made to
[1:15:43] connect to the magnet. Now, all these
[1:15:46] things are are are God is trying to
[1:15:50] establish with you because faith comes
[1:15:54] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:15:57] God. And he wants you to establish and
[1:16:01] have it established in your heart that
[1:16:05] that he is the one that picked you. He
[1:16:09] is the one that chosen you. He is the
[1:16:13] one that's going to do the work in you.
[1:16:16] He is the one that's going to complete
[1:16:18] the work because he wants you to have
[1:16:21] faith in the potential that you have.
[1:16:26] So he you say, "Am I raptured?" I'm not
[1:16:30] raptured yet, but I have the rapture in
[1:16:34] me. I have the spirit of the rapture in
[1:16:38] me. So therefore, I can I can I can work
[1:16:44] according to what's within
[1:16:47] me. And and I just love the way that
[1:16:51] that he explains it. And so if I don't
[1:16:55] know some of you uh I I'm not real
[1:16:57] familiar with all you can do on on
[1:17:01] things, but I know some of you can have
[1:17:03] your phones, you can have your tablets,
[1:17:05] and you can mark as we go through this
[1:17:08] this morning. But uh we're we're going
[1:17:11] to start uh we're going to start on
[1:17:15] uh in the Easter seal and we're going to
[1:17:20] start uh I think it's about paragraph uh
[1:17:26] uh I think it's about paragraph I think
[1:17:29] it was was it paragraph 60 Gary? What?
[1:17:33] We're going to start on paragraph 61 and
[1:17:36] we're going to go to the end of
[1:17:38] paragraph
[1:17:40] 24. And it's just about 35 minutes. I
[1:17:44] won't speak long after this, but I'm
[1:17:47] going to read a few statements to you
[1:17:50] ahead of time and and then uh so uh and
[1:17:57] and then we will listen to it together.
[1:18:01] And I hope that this fortifies you this
[1:18:04] morning. But he he he makes this
[1:18:07] statement in paragraph 66. He says,
[1:18:10] "There was thousands there that
[1:18:14] had had obeying an hour
[1:18:18] past, but there was a present tense
[1:18:25] hour. That was the hour that Jesus was
[1:18:29] to appear.
[1:18:31] And there stood the word. There stood
[1:18:34] the
[1:18:35] people. And here was the manifestation
[1:18:39] of God taking place to vindicate that
[1:18:43] that was the truth. Now he makes that
[1:18:47] statement and there was the
[1:18:51] people right there was the word the
[1:18:55] fulfillment of Malachi 4. letting me
[1:18:58] know that this is a present tense hour.
[1:19:03] So this morning, you are a different
[1:19:06] people. You are a called out people. You
[1:19:10] are a separated people. That there's
[1:19:13] been a change in time. There's been a
[1:19:17] change. And God has always been a God of
[1:19:21] change. And he's changing us. And
[1:19:26] man's nature is to set up camp, is to
[1:19:30] believe something, to hold on to it and
[1:19:34] hope that when he gets
[1:19:36] there, you know what I mean? That what
[1:19:39] he's holding on is good enough to get
[1:19:43] through. That's not the relationship
[1:19:46] that God is wanting to have with us. He
[1:19:49] wants us to know that I'm with you. I'm
[1:19:53] in you. I'm dwelling in you. I'm
[1:19:56] transforming you. I'm changing you. I'm
[1:20:00] bringing you to a rapture. I'm bringing
[1:20:03] you to a resurrection. I'm bringing you
[1:20:05] to perfection. I'm working within you.
[1:20:09] I'm performing my will within you. Don't
[1:20:12] don't get discouraged. Don't beat
[1:20:14] yourself down. Don't don't fear the
[1:20:17] enemy. I put the potential in you. I put
[1:20:21] my spirit in you. It will not fail. The
[1:20:25] flesh is going to war against the spirit
[1:20:27] and the spirit against the flesh. And
[1:20:30] you're going to be in this battle.
[1:20:32] You're going to have this battle in your
[1:20:34] mind. You're going to have this battle
[1:20:36] in your flesh. But fear not, little
[1:20:38] flock.
[1:20:42] I'm the one that called you.
[1:20:45] I'm the one that drew you. I'm the one
[1:20:48] that chose you.
[1:20:51] I'm the one that's taking care of you.
[1:20:53] I'm the one that's going to get you
[1:20:55] through.
[1:20:57] Well, you were yet a sinner. I died for
[1:20:59] you. He said, when before you were ever
[1:21:03] here, I I saw you. I knew you. I knew
[1:21:06] the color of your hair. I knew the color
[1:21:09] of your eyes. I knew the statue within.
[1:21:12] He wants he he's trying to get us back
[1:21:15] in to a positive relationship with his
[1:21:20] spirit knowing we have his spirit by our
[1:21:24] own
[1:21:26] personal experience with him and change
[1:21:29] in our heart and change in our lives
[1:21:32] that he performed on us where we're not
[1:21:35] comparing
[1:21:36] ourselves one with another. We're not
[1:21:40] listening to what everybody's else
[1:21:44] definition is of being born again, what
[1:21:47] everybody others definition is of what
[1:21:50] having the Holy Spirit is. But you could
[1:21:53] take it from the word of God that it was
[1:21:56] a
[1:21:58] promise that he purchased for
[1:22:02] you. He paid the price. He went to
[1:22:06] Calvary. He shed the blood. We're not
[1:22:09] worthy of it.
[1:22:11] We'll never be worthy of
[1:22:14] it, but by his grace and his
[1:22:19] mercy, he chose
[1:22:23] me. And that's what I have to
[1:22:26] understand. I didn't choose him. He
[1:22:30] chose me. He does the drawing. We don't
[1:22:34] do the drawing.
[1:22:36] All the father hath given me will come.
[1:22:40] I won't lose a one. And now when we can
[1:22:43] start
[1:22:45] identifying with that knowing that that
[1:22:49] life is in us, that that spirit is in
[1:22:53] us. We've we've had that change of
[1:22:55] nature. We've felt that pull. We've
[1:22:59] heard that call. We know that we're not
[1:23:02] what we used to be. And now we we take
[1:23:05] possession of it. We know what we get
[1:23:09] rid of the question all together in our
[1:23:13] mind whether we have the Holy Spirit or
[1:23:15] not. We understand what it is. It's not
[1:23:19] us. It's him.
[1:23:21] He chose us. We didn't choose him. He
[1:23:24] put it in us
[1:23:27] before we even got here.
[1:23:31] There was a part of us that was there
[1:23:34] when we heard the scream that part in us
[1:23:37] called out recognized we wanted it and
[1:23:40] he began to do the work in us when we
[1:23:42] could come to that
[1:23:44] place that we're we're we've settled the
[1:23:48] question and we're positive that that
[1:23:52] spirit is in us. We're positive that he
[1:23:56] called us. We're positive that he put
[1:24:00] the potential in there to do all things.
[1:24:04] Then we can start
[1:24:07] moving based on what that we have.
[1:24:11] Silver and gold have I none, but that
[1:24:14] which I have I give to
[1:24:18] you. And then so I I don't know how to
[1:24:22] say it in my human words. Uh
[1:24:27] but in instead of always putting it
[1:24:32] off on a letter
[1:24:36] promise, you you understand always
[1:24:39] saying, "Well, it's wrote
[1:24:42] here. It's wrote
[1:24:45] here. It it's said here." You You
[1:24:48] understand? Now you know that the what
[1:24:52] makes
[1:24:54] this come alive is in you.
[1:25:00] And because it's in you, it's in you. So
[1:25:06] you can make this come alive in the
[1:25:11] world that you're living in. And nobody
[1:25:14] can take your place.
[1:25:17] Each one of you lives in a world of your
[1:25:20] own. Even you say, "Well, I'm married. I
[1:25:23] don't live in a world." You know, uh,
[1:25:26] yes, we
[1:25:28] do. We certain all that we have, all
[1:25:31] that we're influenced, everything about
[1:25:33] us is is personal. And now you could
[1:25:37] take this, the gift that God gave you,
[1:25:40] the spirit that God gave you, the life
[1:25:43] that he gave you. No. Am I worthy? No.
[1:25:46] But I know he called me. I know when I
[1:25:48] heard that scream, I knew it was the
[1:25:51] truth. And I've been trying to change.
[1:25:53] I've been trying to do better. I've been
[1:25:55] trying to work. That's all
[1:25:58] God. And then when we can start having
[1:26:01] confidence that that God lives in us,
[1:26:05] then we'll start doing the works.
[1:26:08] And it's not st it's not always looking
[1:26:13] outside for something to happen. If it's
[1:26:16] not saying, well, you know, you pray for
[1:26:19] somebody and you say, well, it's wrote
[1:26:21] right here now. Do you believe this? No,
[1:26:24] you possess
[1:26:26] it. You're going to what's in you is
[1:26:30] going to make this
[1:26:32] live because this is what the prophet of
[1:26:35] God says. He says the word doesn't
[1:26:38] quicken.
[1:26:41] So I can give you scripture after
[1:26:43] scripture after
[1:26:45] scripture. But if when I can give you
[1:26:48] what I've got, the love that's in my
[1:26:51] heart, the promise, the spirit that's
[1:26:54] within me, the the joy that's that
[1:26:57] floods my
[1:26:59] soul. In other words, I'm not I'm just
[1:27:01] not handing you a piece of paper with
[1:27:05] something written on it and say,
[1:27:07] "Believe this.
[1:27:10] No, I possess
[1:27:15] the quickening power to make this come
[1:27:20] alive and demonstrate to you that Jesus
[1:27:25] Christ has risen from the dead and he is
[1:27:29] alive. And I would love to be able to
[1:27:32] preach it, but I can't preach it as good
[1:27:34] as he preaches it. So, if you'd forgive
[1:27:37] me, uh uh you know, I had my surgery
[1:27:40] Thursday and I I had a a a growth
[1:27:43] removed from my neck and uh uh Leslie
[1:27:48] has a video of it. If anybody wants to
[1:27:50] watch it, it's up to you. You know what
[1:27:53] I mean? But uh
[1:27:55] uh so, but anyway, so I I'm doing well.
[1:28:00] Uh it's and been going through a few
[1:28:02] things with uh my my chest cold, but uh
[1:28:07] uh this is just so good this morning.
[1:28:11] So, if you could just give 30 minutes
[1:28:14] and just listen to what he's telling
[1:28:17] you. It wasn't you. There was something
[1:28:20] in you. It's the Holy Spirit drawing
[1:28:23] you. It's God quickening you. If it you
[1:28:27] know what I mean? and you start
[1:28:28] listening to it's all been him. It's all
[1:28:32] been him. And and
[1:28:35] and I tell you, I don't care if if you
[1:28:38] just walked out of robbing a bank and
[1:28:42] walked in here this morning. If you can
[1:28:45] receive
[1:28:46] this, you can leave that behind.
[1:28:50] return the money and and
[1:28:54] and
[1:28:56] and you can go and sin no
[1:29:01] more. And you don't have to be
[1:29:03] ashamed of any mistakes you've made. You
[1:29:08] can put your past behind you and let the
[1:29:11] love of God be shed abroad in your heart
[1:29:15] and the goodness of what that he's given
[1:29:18] you. and you can start standing up and
[1:29:23] testifying of what God has done for me.
[1:29:27] Yes, this little hippie boy from
[1:29:30] California, God give him his spirit.
[1:29:33] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I love you for
[1:29:35] it. And it's been freely given to me.
[1:29:38] I'm going to freely give. And I I I
[1:29:41] don't know how to to express it, but if
[1:29:44] you would listen to 30 minutes of this
[1:29:47] with me this morning, I I believe it'll
[1:29:51] be a blessing to you. And I I know some
[1:29:55] of you that we have certain language
[1:29:57] barriers and I know it's harder for you,
[1:30:01] but if you can find this in in your own
[1:30:04] language and go back and read through
[1:30:07] it, I trust it would be a a a blessing
[1:30:11] to you this morning. So, God richly
[1:30:13] bless you. I love you with all my heart
[1:30:16] and I I don't know of anything better to
[1:30:18] give you this morning than the voice of
[1:30:20] Malachi 4:5. God bless you.
[1:30:25] Now, there's a great statement and I
[1:30:27] want my minister brothers to try to
[1:30:29] understand this. See, in the beginning,
[1:30:32] God, the great spirit, he wasn't even
[1:30:35] God. Then he was the eternal one. God is
[1:30:38] an object of worship. He had nothing to
[1:30:40] worship him. There was no there was no
[1:30:42] angels, no nothing. Just God alone. Him
[1:30:45] alone is eternal. But in order to be
[1:30:48] God, there had to be something to
[1:30:49] worship him. So he created angels and
[1:30:52] beings and uh cherubans and so forth to
[1:30:57] worship him. His great plan begin to
[1:30:59] unfold. But remember
[1:31:02] you and the the statue that you are in
[1:31:06] this
[1:31:07] morning. If you wasn't in his thinking
[1:31:10] then you're not now. Amen. For you,
[1:31:14] there's some part that's in you that's
[1:31:17] eternal.
[1:31:19] And eternal only belongs to God. And in
[1:31:23] God was his thinking of you sitting
[1:31:25] right where you are now. In his
[1:31:28] thinking, I stood at the pullpit this
[1:31:30] morning because he's infinite and knows
[1:31:34] all things. Therefore, he could tell the
[1:31:37] end from the beginning because he's
[1:31:39] eternal. Amen. And you being a son of
[1:31:43] God or a daughter of
[1:31:45] God, then you were in his thinking at
[1:31:48] the beginning.
[1:31:50] And then when the Holy Spirit come and
[1:31:53] you're on earth walking around here as a
[1:31:56] sinner, way down in your life is
[1:31:58] something you don't know what's taking
[1:32:00] place, but you're hungry. I heard the
[1:32:02] Presbyterian brother. I heard the the
[1:32:05] Baptist talking about back there. He was
[1:32:07] a a free Baptist preaching where he can.
[1:32:10] my fellow brother that you there's
[1:32:13] something in you
[1:32:16] something that you never put in there.
[1:32:20] It's something that you couldn't desire
[1:32:22] to be in there. It's something that's
[1:32:24] contrary to your own nature.
[1:32:28] It's the fornowledge of God taking
[1:32:30] place.
[1:32:32] God's
[1:32:34] word as Jesus is born the son of God to
[1:32:38] be
[1:32:39] Emmanuel God's full expression in a man
[1:32:44] and he found him in perfect obedience
[1:32:47] down at the river of Jordan being
[1:32:50] baptized for that prophet
[1:32:52] and as soon as he obeyed him and walked
[1:32:55] out of the water the heavens opened to
[1:32:57] John and he saw the Holy Ghost
[1:32:59] descending from heaven saying This is my
[1:33:02] beloved son.
[1:33:04] Perfect obedience. The spirit had sought
[1:33:07] him out in
[1:33:09] obedience. Oh, wayward man or woman this
[1:33:13] morning. When you're sitting here and
[1:33:16] there's something in you telling you
[1:33:18] this is right, it's the Holy Spirit
[1:33:21] seeking you out. That's
[1:33:24] it. to bring you to a knowledge of truth
[1:33:30] of this hour that we're now living. Not
[1:33:33] some hour that's gone by. The hour now.
[1:33:37] There was thousands there that obeying
[1:33:40] an hour past. But there was a present
[1:33:43] tense hour. That was the hour that Jesus
[1:33:45] was to appear. And there stood the word.
[1:33:49] There stood the people. And here was a
[1:33:52] manifestation of God taking place to
[1:33:55] vindicate that that was the truth.
[1:33:59] And as Pentecostal people today, let me
[1:34:02] say this that we're standing in this
[1:34:05] last days where God promised he'd pour
[1:34:08] out his spirit upon all flesh and his
[1:34:10] sons and daughters should prophesy sign.
[1:34:13] These signs shall follow them that
[1:34:15] believe. It's the hour. That's what
[1:34:18] makes that creation in you. As I spoke
[1:34:21] here not long ago, it sounded a little
[1:34:24] sacriiggious, but I hope it don't to you
[1:34:26] this morning. The farmer that set the
[1:34:29] eagle or set the hen and had a eagle
[1:34:31] egg. Many of you remembers the story of
[1:34:34] the old eagle giving birth to to this or
[1:34:37] the hen giving birth over here to this
[1:34:39] chicken or or egg of a eagle under her
[1:34:42] chicken feathers. See, it's the
[1:34:44] atmosphere. the Presbyterian church,
[1:34:47] Methodist church, Baptist church, any of
[1:34:50] them can bring forth these eagles. Sure,
[1:34:53] it's the atmosphere that does it. Amen.
[1:34:56] As Dr. Bosworth used to say, you could
[1:34:57] take a hint egg and put it over a under
[1:34:59] a pup and tie them down, a puppet hatch
[1:35:01] out a chicken.
[1:35:03] Wow. It's the atmosphere. And when any
[1:35:06] church or any group that'll civil
[1:35:08] themselves together and pray until
[1:35:11] they're throw away their creeds and
[1:35:13] things and look straight in the face of
[1:35:15] God, it'll bring forth eagles just as
[1:35:18] certain as I'm standing here. Amen.
[1:35:21] That's what I think this businessman's
[1:35:23] group has done. Trying to break up the
[1:35:26] atmosphere. We're getting two clanish.
[1:35:28] One belongs to this and that. Let's
[1:35:30] break up the atmosphere and get the
[1:35:32] atmosphere in a heavenly worship. get
[1:35:36] the atmosphere right. Eagles will be
[1:35:38] born any out of any church anywhere.
[1:35:41] That's right. And this little eagle
[1:35:43] walked with the hen for a long time. But
[1:35:46] the the clocking was kind of
[1:35:48] strange. He didn't understand what the
[1:35:51] hen meant when she scratched in the the
[1:35:54] the waste of the manure piles in in the
[1:35:57] yards. And that wasn't food to him. and
[1:36:02] uh she eat bugs and so forth that a
[1:36:04] eagle doesn't eat. So it seems strange
[1:36:07] all to him and he was an ugly duckling.
[1:36:11] He was uh not saying it's sacriiggious,
[1:36:14] maybe it's a free willist and but
[1:36:17] something on that order or Presbyterian.
[1:36:20] Amen. But you know, one day his mother
[1:36:23] knew that she had laid an egg.
[1:36:30] There had to be a child somewhere.
[1:36:35] So she throw her big wings into the
[1:36:38] winds and she searched and she searched,
[1:36:42] screaming to the top of her voice. And
[1:36:45] one day she passed over the barnyard.
[1:36:48] And when this little eagle heard this
[1:36:50] familiar scream, he had never heard it
[1:36:52] before.
[1:36:54] But he realized that it fit him like a
[1:36:57] glove over hand.
[1:37:00] And he knew that was his mother. She
[1:37:03] knew that was her son. She was looking
[1:37:05] for him. So has God in every age
[1:37:11] ordained his church for that age, a
[1:37:14] message for that age. And they could
[1:37:17] have laws and anything that they want
[1:37:20] to. But when that hour comes, the Holy
[1:37:23] Spirit of God, which is at the beginning
[1:37:27] thought out and spoke out for that age,
[1:37:29] that spirit hunts that egg.
[1:37:33] And when he hears that message, there's
[1:37:36] no church denomination going to hold it.
[1:37:38] It'll rise to the heights. Oh,
[1:37:41] hallelujah. It's got to It's a different
[1:37:45] bird. Amen. It's a different creature.
[1:37:49] He's a eagle. And he'll hear the scream,
[1:37:52] "My sheep hear my voice." Amen. As
[1:37:57] someone said, "Brother Williams, sheep
[1:38:00] food. My sheep hear my voice. A stranger
[1:38:05] they will not follow." Amen. No matter
[1:38:07] how loyal the church has been, how much
[1:38:10] it's big a name it's got, when my sheep
[1:38:12] hear my voice, which is a word, amen, a
[1:38:16] stranger, they will not follow, they'll
[1:38:19] go right straight to that word. They
[1:38:21] can't do it. It's like a a a magnet.
[1:38:25] One day up in Indiana, I was visiting
[1:38:27] them steel mills and the whistle blowed
[1:38:30] and everybody took off their aprons and
[1:38:32] begin to sweep the out from their lathes
[1:38:34] out into the middle of the floor the
[1:38:36] shavings that they made through the day.
[1:38:39] And I was walking along with the man
[1:38:40] that was taking me through and he
[1:38:42] said, "Watch this." And so every man
[1:38:46] ladies his bench dress up on the upon
[1:38:51] the table walked away. way back in the
[1:38:54] back. He touched the little button and
[1:38:56] here come a big magnet through and it
[1:38:59] picked up every bit of that uh iron that
[1:39:03] was shaved off of those pieces. Now it
[1:39:06] went out, it demagnetized it, it dropped
[1:39:08] into a cupole and was melted over for
[1:39:11] another piece of of goods, the same
[1:39:13] thing, actuals or whatever they were
[1:39:16] building. And I stood there and looked
[1:39:18] at that till I I just lost myself. And I
[1:39:22] said, "I'm wondering something." He
[1:39:24] said, "What is it, sir?" And I said, "I
[1:39:26] noticed that some of that didn't go up."
[1:39:30] He said, "It's
[1:39:31] aluminum and the magnet is not
[1:39:34] magnetized to the aluminum." I said, "I
[1:39:37] see." And he said, "Then I said, well,
[1:39:40] do you notice there's a piece of iron
[1:39:42] laying across?" But you see, sir, it was
[1:39:44] bolted down. I said, "I see." And I when
[1:39:48] he tucked it out and I said, "Now, what
[1:39:49] happened out there?" Says, "It goes
[1:39:51] right back into the mill, poured out
[1:39:53] through the cube below, it comes right
[1:39:54] back in next to the wheel." I said,
[1:39:57] "Praise the Lord. That's it." See, there
[1:40:00] is a great magnet sitting in the sky
[1:40:02] that God one day will touch his fingers
[1:40:04] till no man knows the time is coming.
[1:40:07] Not even the angels of heaven doesn't
[1:40:08] know. God alone knows. That's it. But
[1:40:12] there has been some trimmings that's
[1:40:15] come off of the Bible
[1:40:18] Bible Christians believers for this
[1:40:22] hour. One of them might have been axel
[1:40:24] back in another day. This might be some
[1:40:26] other part. It's going on to make the
[1:40:28] big regime of God, but it'll be molded
[1:40:32] into the pot of God's great cupo and
[1:40:35] poured out again into the images of God.
[1:40:38] Amen. Just those who are magnetized to
[1:40:41] it will be taken up. Oh, how to what a
[1:40:45] privilege it is to know that there is
[1:40:48] something in the resurrection that's
[1:40:50] pertaining to us. Now, notice recognize
[1:40:54] the call of God's word which he is a
[1:40:57] part of and it's a eagle to an
[1:41:00] eagle. Now, if that mother would have
[1:41:02] screamed like a a buzzard, he'd have
[1:41:05] never noted. He'd been just as well off
[1:41:07] in the barnyard, but it was a scream of
[1:41:10] an eagle. There was something inside
[1:41:13] that little fella. Amen. That he knowed
[1:41:16] he was an eagle. And the same thing is
[1:41:19] with every true
[1:41:21] believer. When the preaching of God's
[1:41:23] word comes forth and vindicated and
[1:41:26] proved that it's God's word for this
[1:41:28] hour, then there's something within the
[1:41:31] believer. I don't care how loyal his
[1:41:32] father was to a church or how loyal his
[1:41:34] mother was or his grandparents. And if
[1:41:37] that church is teaching contrary to this
[1:41:40] hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:42] message, there's something in him. It
[1:41:44] screams out.
[1:41:46] He'll leave the barnyard. He's got to do
[1:41:49] it. The chicken might have been all
[1:41:51] right one day, but this is eagle hour.
[1:41:53] See, it's a different It's something
[1:41:55] that he must leave the old cook and fly
[1:41:59] away into the blue.
[1:42:01] Then this earthly body is quickened and
[1:42:04] brought by the quickening spirit to the
[1:42:07] obedience of God's word. Now when this
[1:42:11] holy spirit represented as the eagle
[1:42:14] flying over the land and finds the
[1:42:16] believer, no man can come to me. No man
[1:42:21] can come to me as he wants to. All the
[1:42:23] father has given me will come to me. But
[1:42:26] no man can come by himself. It isn't
[1:42:28] your own thinking, your own drawing.
[1:42:30] It's God drawing. See, all the Father
[1:42:33] has given me will come to me. Now, the
[1:42:35] Holy Spirit is here on earth looking out
[1:42:39] those individuals that God has ordained
[1:42:43] to life in this age. And as soon as it
[1:42:46] finds it, it does just like it did on
[1:42:47] Jesus Christ, the great super son of God
[1:42:50] who redeemed us all. It comes down and
[1:42:53] takes this place of abode into the human
[1:42:55] life. Now notice brought the quickening
[1:42:59] power. Now that quickening power that
[1:43:02] come upon Jesus quicken him to manifest
[1:43:07] every promise of the word of that day.
[1:43:11] So does the Holy Spirit that come upon
[1:43:13] us in this day? If it's not a mockery
[1:43:16] Holy Spirit, if it's not the devil
[1:43:18] mocking the Holy Spirit, but is the real
[1:43:21] true Holy Spirit, it'll manifest the
[1:43:24] promise of this hour.
[1:43:26] When it fell upon Luther, it manifested
[1:43:28] that promise of that hour. When it fell
[1:43:30] upon Wesley, it manifested the promise
[1:43:32] of that hour. When it falls in this day,
[1:43:35] it manifests the promise of this hour.
[1:43:37] Amen. When it fell upon Moses, it
[1:43:39] manifested the promise of that hour.
[1:43:41] Fell upon Noah, it manifest the promise
[1:43:43] of that hour. When it fell upon Jesus,
[1:43:45] it manifest the promise of that hour.
[1:43:47] See, it's the Holy Spirit coming down to
[1:43:52] quicken, make alive those people that's
[1:43:56] fore orained of God to be in the
[1:43:59] rapture. That is, if he is a true eagle,
[1:44:02] he will understand the message of the
[1:44:07] hour if he's a true eagle. Now, the
[1:44:09] little eagle problem in the barnyard was
[1:44:11] eating all right, but he he know it
[1:44:14] wasn't just exactly right. But then when
[1:44:17] he heard the truth, then he received
[1:44:19] this truth. Now in John 14 uh uh John
[1:44:23] 5:24 rather, Jesus said speaking this
[1:44:27] way, he that heareth my words and
[1:44:31] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:44:35] everlasting life, and shall not come
[1:44:37] into the judgment, but pass from death
[1:44:40] unto life. Just think how simple that
[1:44:43] is. He that believeth. Now the correct
[1:44:46] way of saying that, he that
[1:44:48] understandeth. Now you go out here on
[1:44:50] the street and say to this prostitute,
[1:44:51] you believe? Sure. You believe the son
[1:44:53] of God? Certainly. Been baptized. Sure.
[1:44:55] Go out there drunkard and say, you hear
[1:44:57] that? Hear that preacher preach? Yeah.
[1:44:58] You believe that? Sure. See, but he that
[1:45:01] understandeth,
[1:45:03] Amen. He that knoweth his place in this
[1:45:06] hour, he that heareth my word and
[1:45:10] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:45:13] present tense eternal life, shall not
[1:45:16] come into judgment, but already passed
[1:45:18] from death unto life. Then when this new
[1:45:21] eternal life dwells in
[1:45:24] you, it is the potential or the
[1:45:28] earnestness of you being quickened from
[1:45:32] mortal to immortality.
[1:45:35] Let me say that again. When this spirit
[1:45:39] has found you, the individual and has
[1:45:43] come upon you, it is the
[1:45:47] potential of your eternal inheritance
[1:45:51] that God thought of you and made for you
[1:45:54] before the foundation of the world.
[1:45:57] That is your potential. Like if you ask
[1:46:00] me for an oak tree and I give you an
[1:46:01] acre. Now the the the life for the oak
[1:46:05] tree is in the acorn now. But you have
[1:46:09] to wait till it grows up. So do we. When
[1:46:12] you receive the Holy Spirit of God, it's
[1:46:14] God's potential waiting upon you that's
[1:46:18] already recognized you and you're sealed
[1:46:20] by the spirit of promise of God into the
[1:46:22] body of Christ. When God looked down at
[1:46:25] Calvary and seen Jesus dying, he not he
[1:46:29] died for his bride, the body, which is
[1:46:32] the word church, the church that
[1:46:34] believes the word of God for the age
[1:46:36] where his feet, body, head or wherever
[1:46:38] it is. Amen. See, it's Christ was
[1:46:41] bleeding and dying and God looking upon
[1:46:45] him saw his resurrection and the church
[1:46:49] raised with him on Easter. Now, I want
[1:46:52] you to get all this together because I
[1:46:53] got something here a little bit. I want
[1:46:55] to say the Lord will. Now, notice it's
[1:46:58] the
[1:46:59] earnest or the
[1:47:01] potential, the quickening power of your
[1:47:06] resurrection when you receive the Holy
[1:47:08] Spirit is then dwelling in you. The
[1:47:13] potential of it. Notice you you are now
[1:47:18] on your way growing to the full
[1:47:21] resurrection. No tree just comes up
[1:47:24] overnight. It's got to grow as we grow
[1:47:27] in the grace and knowledge of God. You
[1:47:29] are baptized into the Holy Spirit. Now,
[1:47:32] as a Pentecostal church baptized into
[1:47:34] the Holy Spirit, it's begin growing.
[1:47:36] Limbs has died. He's pruned them off.
[1:47:39] But the tree is still growing. is still
[1:47:41] going on because it's got to come to the
[1:47:43] resurrection. They're led by the spirit
[1:47:47] to quicken the word to you who is
[1:47:51] believers. The word keeps quickening.
[1:47:53] Come the first limb, second limb, third
[1:47:55] limb on up. It just keeps quickening.
[1:47:57] The spirit of God keeps quickening to
[1:47:59] you. Notice at Pentecost, their bodies
[1:48:02] were quickened by the new life they
[1:48:06] received.
[1:48:07] Amen.
[1:48:09] That makes me feel religious.
[1:48:12] Think now here was man, fishermen, tax
[1:48:16] collectors, the humble little women,
[1:48:19] other just ordinary housewives, little
[1:48:22] virgin girls. They were believers. They
[1:48:25] were believing that this was the truth.
[1:48:28] They believed that when Jesus died, they
[1:48:30] believed on him and rose up again from
[1:48:32] the dead. They believe that to be the
[1:48:35] absolutely testimony of God that he had
[1:48:38] quickened him to life. Now they go up to
[1:48:41] the day of Pentecost to receive their
[1:48:44] abstract. You know what an abstract is?
[1:48:47] It's when a deed's been cleared. They
[1:48:49] went up there to receive their abstract
[1:48:52] and they become quickened. Or what a
[1:48:56] thrill. They bought the land been bought
[1:48:58] for him. They had received it. Is it
[1:49:00] true or not? We've seen him raise up.
[1:49:02] But now, what about us? We are
[1:49:04] witnesses. We stood and seen the man
[1:49:07] crucified. We seen the clouds come over
[1:49:10] the earth and dark in the skies. And the
[1:49:12] the earthquake and shook and had nervous
[1:49:16] prostration. Then when they put him in
[1:49:18] the grave, they speared him in the heart
[1:49:20] with the spear. And they took his body
[1:49:22] down and laid it in the grave of Joseph
[1:49:25] or Arthia. And then they find out that
[1:49:28] on the third day he raised up
[1:49:32] again. And as the disciples said, we are
[1:49:35] witnesses of this. We seen him raise up.
[1:49:39] We know he's alive. Now, what did that
[1:49:42] do? That took all the fear out. No
[1:49:45] wonder Jesus said, "Fear not. I'm he
[1:49:48] that was dead and is alive forever
[1:49:50] more." It taken all the fear out when
[1:49:53] they did that. Now, but when they went
[1:49:56] up to Pentecost, there they received the
[1:50:00] quickening power, the power that made
[1:50:02] them alive. Now, there's where I think
[1:50:04] that you Presbyterian and Methodist
[1:50:06] brethren, you do receive potentially on
[1:50:09] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, but
[1:50:12] the abstract hasn't come yet.
[1:50:15] That's the clearing of the need. God
[1:50:18] gave Abraham a promise. Abraham believed
[1:50:21] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:50:23] righteousness. But he sealed the
[1:50:25] covenant by the seal of circumcision.
[1:50:28] Amen. And God gives you a promise
[1:50:31] potentially that you will receive it and
[1:50:33] you're going to be raised up. This body
[1:50:35] is going to be glorified with him in the
[1:50:37] end time. But you see, you have to get a
[1:50:40] clearance on that deed. Amen. And the
[1:50:43] clearance is when everything against it
[1:50:46] has been stricken off.
[1:50:48] And you got the abstract to it. You've
[1:50:51] got the seal.
[1:50:53] It's yours. Everything's on it belongs
[1:50:56] to you.
[1:50:57] Amen. And when we believe on Jesus
[1:51:00] Christ for our savior and repent and are
[1:51:03] baptized and come up to believing, God
[1:51:07] recognizes our repentance and our faith
[1:51:09] towards him and sends down the abstract.
[1:51:13] And the abstract is the assurance.
[1:51:17] It's a guarantee that everything was
[1:51:20] ever held against you. You have
[1:51:22] thoroughly repented. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:51:26] And the property is boughten and you
[1:51:29] hold the abstract for the assurance. Let
[1:51:32] somebody try to put you off the land.
[1:51:33] Say he belongs and you the abstract in
[1:51:35] your hand. Let him try to do it. They
[1:51:37] don't law in the land can do it because
[1:51:39] you hold the abstract. And there's no
[1:51:43] devil, no church or any theology that
[1:51:47] can overstep the boundaries of God's
[1:51:50] proof and abstract that the baptism of
[1:51:53] the Holy Ghost has recognized us in
[1:51:55] Jesus Christ. Amen. We're just as sure
[1:51:59] to raise as he raised because
[1:52:01] potentially we have already raised in
[1:52:04] him. Amen. Amen. Amen. The old things,
[1:52:08] what does it do to our mortal bodies? It
[1:52:11] turns our opinions, changes our notions.
[1:52:14] It sets our affections on things which
[1:52:17] are above. And the smoking, drinking,
[1:52:19] gaming, the things that you used to do
[1:52:22] is dead. It's beneath you. And you are
[1:52:25] quickened. And this quickening power
[1:52:28] brings your body into a raptured
[1:52:32] condition.
[1:52:34] Amen. Already notice the Pentecostal
[1:52:37] people up there when they got quickened
[1:52:39] by the Holy Spirit, listen to
[1:52:42] me. When those Pentecostal group up
[1:52:45] there on the day of Pentecost received
[1:52:48] their abstract deed from God, surely
[1:52:51] glorified their souls. They screamed.
[1:52:54] They saw tongues of fire separated up on
[1:52:57] each of them. And it so quickened their
[1:52:59] body till they couldn't even speak an
[1:53:02] earthly language anymore. It quickened
[1:53:04] their body to heavenly language.
[1:53:08] The place they're going to quickening
[1:53:12] power of God shook their mortal body. So
[1:53:15] till their entire mortal language was
[1:53:19] transfigured, transformed into an
[1:53:22] immortal language. What a quickening
[1:53:25] power.
[1:53:26] What something it belongs? If the spirit
[1:53:29] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:53:32] dwells in your mortal bodies, it shall
[1:53:35] also quicken your mortal bodies. Amen.
[1:53:38] We are quickening by the power of the
[1:53:41] living God. Tongues quickened to a new
[1:53:44] heavenly language to speak to them, a
[1:53:47] rapturing up, raising up into a
[1:53:49] different atmosphere than what they'd
[1:53:51] ever lived in. also with the new
[1:53:53] quickening life to them that come in
[1:53:56] them. It quickened their language. They
[1:53:58] spoke in new tongues. Oh yes. Now watch
[1:54:02] it. Um it also was designed to give them
[1:54:09] answer this abstract. It was designed to
[1:54:12] give them every
[1:54:15] promise that was on the
[1:54:18] grounds. Every promise on the grounds of
[1:54:21] God's word that was promised in the
[1:54:24] Bible. That quickening power was given
[1:54:27] to them to quicken that promise to them.
[1:54:32] Therefore, they laid hands on the sick.
[1:54:35] They was
[1:54:35] healed. They spoke in new tongues.
[1:54:39] They've done great signs and wonders
[1:54:41] because that was in God's promise. And
[1:54:44] when Jesus died to redeem that back to
[1:54:48] them, the grounds that belong to sons of
[1:54:50] God, he demonstrated what God was. How
[1:54:53] dare we to socialize that and put it
[1:54:56] into an
[1:54:57] organization. We have no rights to do
[1:54:59] that. It's the Holy Spirit today hunting
[1:55:02] out honest hearts that will believe that
[1:55:04] message.
[1:55:06] Everything in the Bible that was
[1:55:08] promised is to that believer. And when
[1:55:11] you accept it in its fullness and God
[1:55:13] knows that you'll do it, he gives you
[1:55:15] the abstract to that. And then every
[1:55:18] promise that's made is in your
[1:55:20] possession. And the Holy Spirit's there
[1:55:23] to quicken that to you. Thank you. Oh
[1:55:26] my. What kind of people should we be?
[1:55:29] How wonderful to see that God's great
[1:55:31] Holy Spirit you're to do that power.
[1:55:34] Think of it. When the Holy Ghost itself
[1:55:37] here to bear record of this hour,
[1:55:40] Jesus said, "So, he's the same
[1:55:43] yesterday, today, and forever. How dare
[1:55:46] any man to wipe that out of
[1:55:49] works that I do shall you do also?" John
[1:55:51] 14:12.
[1:55:53] These signs shall follow them that
[1:55:55] believe. That is the assurance. When we
[1:55:58] see a group of people sitting together
[1:56:00] in those signs manifesting themselves,
[1:56:02] that's the assurance that the abstract
[1:56:05] desire to vindicate that that's property
[1:56:07] of God. Amen. Amen. So, we are Easter
[1:56:11] also.
[1:56:13] Amen. We are now in our Easter. We've
[1:56:16] already raised Hallelujah. from the
[1:56:19] things of the world to the things of
[1:56:21] God's promise.
[1:56:23] Not we will, we are. That's right. It's
[1:56:25] the potentials. is God's promise. He'd
[1:56:28] pour out his spirit in the last days.
[1:56:29] And that's what they would do. Notice,
[1:56:33] laid their hands on the sick, everything
[1:56:35] was in God's promise. I shall pour out
[1:56:37] my spirit in the last days upon all
[1:56:40] flesh. Your old man shall dream dreams.
[1:56:42] Your young man shall see visions. And
[1:56:44] all these different promises that he
[1:56:45] made. Everything is laying right there
[1:56:47] in God's promise. Jesus redeemed it to
[1:56:50] us. And when we become or we if we are
[1:56:53] ordained on that ground,
[1:56:57] if we are ordained to be on that ground
[1:57:00] like the eagle walking in the chicken's
[1:57:02] nest. Amen. If you're ordained on that
[1:57:05] ground, the Holy Spirit is sure to find
[1:57:07] you.
[1:57:09] And when it finds you, you recognize
[1:57:12] it's call. You know the hour you're
[1:57:14] living. You know what these things are
[1:57:16] supposed to happen quickly. You're
[1:57:17] raptured up to meet it. And now you're
[1:57:20] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:57:21] Jesus.
[1:57:23] Oh, what a promise. What a heavenly
[1:57:26] father who would give us these things.
[1:57:28] The spirit quickens their fellowship
[1:57:31] with God so that they call the dead back
[1:57:34] to life in that day. They laid their
[1:57:37] bodies upon the dead. They come to life.
[1:57:39] Listen closely. They done the same
[1:57:42] things that Jesus did because the same
[1:57:44] spirit was upon him was upon them. Amen.
[1:57:47] If one spirit makes a man act this way,
[1:57:49] it makes the other act that way. If one,
[1:57:52] how can this come up on say he's got the
[1:57:54] spirit of God and deny the works of God?
[1:57:56] Amen. Cannot do it. Notice God's life
[1:58:00] which is in the Greek called Zoey moving
[1:58:04] through them and
[1:58:11] in I hate to quit
[1:58:14] listening now. that that was good
[1:58:19] and it should encourage us. It should
[1:58:22] lift us up. Listen, let's let's just
[1:58:25] read it slow just for a
[1:58:28] moment. And he says it's God's
[1:58:32] promise he'd pour out his spirit in the
[1:58:36] last days. And that's what they would
[1:58:41] do.
[1:58:42] Notice they laid their hands on the
[1:58:44] sick. Everything that was in God's
[1:58:48] promise. I shall pour out my spirit in
[1:58:52] the last days upon all flesh. Your old
[1:58:56] men shall dream dreams. Your young men
[1:58:58] shall see
[1:59:00] visions. And all these different
[1:59:02] promises that he made, everything is
[1:59:06] lying right there in God's promise. And
[1:59:10] Jesus redeemed it to
[1:59:13] us. And when we become or we if we are
[1:59:20] ordained on that
[1:59:22] ground now this is what we we've he
[1:59:27] wants us
[1:59:29] to claim it. This is our ground.
[1:59:36] In other words, I can walk on this
[1:59:39] ground. This is the promised land. This
[1:59:43] is the life that I
[1:59:45] live. This is how that I do things. This
[1:59:49] is how that I think. This is my
[1:59:53] land. It's my life. It's my inheritance.
[1:59:59] In other words, I my life is not
[2:00:03] something I do as a religious
[2:00:07] uh uh work. It's not something as I do
[2:00:11] as uh reading the Bible and say the
[2:00:14] scripture uh
[2:00:18] says this and this and then I'm going to
[2:00:21] go try to do this. When you receive the
[2:00:26] spirit, which you were ordained to
[2:00:30] receive, you were in his thinking to
[2:00:34] receive it. You were in his mind. In his
[2:00:38] mind, he he wanted you to have this. In
[2:00:41] fact, he sought
[2:00:45] you. He found you. He didn't draw him.
[2:00:49] He drew you.
[2:00:51] He may have given you parents that
[2:00:53] believed. He may have given you a friend
[2:00:55] that believed. He may have let you run
[2:00:57] across a book. It didn't matter how he
[2:01:00] did it. It was him that drew you. The
[2:01:04] reason he drew you because this was your
[2:01:08] inheritance. This is what he created you
[2:01:11] for. See, we're we're doing too much
[2:01:14] waiting for it to come.
[2:01:18] One day. One day. But this is present
[2:01:23] tense. This is the ground I live. This
[2:01:27] is my inheritance. This is my
[2:01:30] life. This is the way that I do
[2:01:34] things. This is my decision makingaking.
[2:01:40] I have
[2:01:43] predetermined
[2:01:45] decisions. My decisions are
[2:01:47] predetermined. My choices are
[2:01:50] predetermined. I I don't go by
[2:01:55] impulse. I don't live by impulse. I
[2:01:59] don't live by
[2:02:00] reaction. I live by leadership. I live
[2:02:05] by direction. I live by predetermined.
[2:02:08] All my actions are predetermined on my
[2:02:12] inheritance and on my possession. It's
[2:02:15] my land. Amen.
[2:02:18] And if the enemy comes on my land, I
[2:02:23] have to be able to stand up and say,
[2:02:25] "Wait a
[2:02:26] minute. You You don't come on my land.
[2:02:29] This is my land. I'm going to take it
[2:02:32] back.
[2:02:36] Why do you have a right to take it
[2:02:40] back? Because I
[2:02:43] possess his
[2:02:46] spirit. I have
[2:02:49] faith in what that he gave
[2:02:54] me. And and I know every time we preach
[2:02:57] about it, everybody starts wondering
[2:03:01] whether they've got it. recognize your
[2:03:08] calling. He told us how you get it. What
[2:03:11] do you go through? You're just living in
[2:03:13] this world as a sinner.
[2:03:16] Right? And all of a sudden, you
[2:03:19] recognize something's not right. That's
[2:03:21] not right. This is right. What I'm
[2:03:24] hearing is
[2:03:26] true. What did he say that was? It's the
[2:03:29] Holy Spirit calling
[2:03:32] you, dealing with
[2:03:35] you, convicting
[2:03:38] you, bringing
[2:03:40] you. He even said it this morning. The
[2:03:43] reason you're sitting here is because
[2:03:45] God put it that
[2:03:48] way. So you can sit back and and look, I
[2:03:52] can look back at my life and I can say,
[2:03:54] I was way in California. There's no way
[2:03:57] I would be with this group of people. I
[2:03:59] was raised a
[2:04:02] Catholic. I was a long-haired hippie
[2:04:05] drug
[2:04:08] dealer. How did I get from there to
[2:04:13] here? You tell
[2:04:15] me. It wasn't even in
[2:04:18] me. That's what he said. There was
[2:04:21] something that was in me that wasn't
[2:04:22] even in me by nature. It was something
[2:04:26] else that was put there. I have to
[2:04:29] recognize that and accept that and make
[2:04:33] my decisions based on
[2:04:38] that. Not
[2:04:40] impulse. I recognize my calling.
[2:04:47] Not my calling in the way of what I'm to
[2:04:51] do, but I recognized how he called
[2:04:58] me. It didn't matter. You were raised up
[2:05:01] in this message. One day you sit on the
[2:05:05] pew and you know what that preacher is
[2:05:07] saying's
[2:05:10] true. He wants you to have confidence in
[2:05:13] that. You didn't choose me. I chose
[2:05:18] you. I'm the one that drew you. And I
[2:05:23] I'm drawing you for a
[2:05:26] purpose that I can put the same
[2:05:29] spirit that was in Jesus that rose him
[2:05:33] from the dead. I can put that same
[2:05:36] spirit in
[2:05:40] you. And it changes your affections.
[2:05:44] It changes your
[2:05:46] notions. It changes the way you look at
[2:05:49] things. It changes the way you make
[2:05:52] decisions. You're not driven by impulse
[2:05:55] anymore. You're not driven by this
[2:05:58] reaction or that reaction or this
[2:06:00] situation or that situation.
[2:06:03] Everything's predetermined to you
[2:06:05] because you have a predetermined place
[2:06:07] you're going. How do you know you're
[2:06:09] going there? You've got the potential of
[2:06:12] it in you.
[2:06:13] And you know what's in you will do what
[2:06:17] it was put in there to do.
[2:06:22] He didn't give you his spirit so you
[2:06:25] could be here. He gave you his spirit so
[2:06:27] he can rapture
[2:06:29] you. Let me just finish reading what I
[2:06:33] was
[2:06:34] reading. He
[2:06:39] said I think I was reading right here.
[2:06:42] If we are ordained on that ground, if we
[2:06:45] are ordained to be on that ground, like
[2:06:47] the eagle walking in the chicken's desk,
[2:06:50] if you're ordained on that ground, the
[2:06:53] Holy Spirit is here to find you. And
[2:06:57] when it finds you, you recognize its
[2:07:03] call. But just ask
[2:07:06] yourself, have you ever been put under
[2:07:10] conviction? Has the Holy Spirit ever
[2:07:13] dealt with your heart? That was him
[2:07:15] calling you. That's a good
[2:07:18] thing. That's praise
[2:07:22] God that I know I'm him. How? Because I
[2:07:26] heard his voice and my sheep hear his
[2:07:32] voice. You're lifted
[2:07:35] up. You're not condemned.
[2:07:39] It just the the father didn't never even
[2:07:43] condemn his prodal son when he returned.
[2:07:46] The minute he saw that boy, the prophet
[2:07:48] God said he sat there and looked out
[2:07:51] every day because he believed that was
[2:07:54] his son and he believed his son would
[2:07:57] return. You are his sons and he knows
[2:08:01] you're going to return. He predestinated
[2:08:04] you to return. He put something in you
[2:08:07] that would return you. Hallelujah.
[2:08:14] This message was mine.
[2:08:17] I was for ordained to it. I am the
[2:08:20] rapture. I am the resurrection. I am the
[2:08:23] message of the hour. I was forained to
[2:08:25] it. Even though I was sitting in San
[2:08:28] Diego lost and and just zero recognition
[2:08:33] of God, the closest thing I knew to God
[2:08:36] was saying a
[2:08:38] rosary to Mary and walking in a box and
[2:08:43] telling another human being all my
[2:08:45] sins, thinking that he was going to give
[2:08:48] me a few
[2:08:49] prayers to wash away. And I'd go out and
[2:08:53] light a candle and and say a few prayers
[2:08:58] and my slate was clean so I could go do
[2:09:02] it all over
[2:09:04] again. That was no
[2:09:08] life. But this was
[2:09:11] mine. And he put something in there. And
[2:09:15] that something had to find it. I didn't
[2:09:19] find it. He found me. He came all the
[2:09:22] way to where I was. Somehow he got in
[2:09:25] San Diego. Somehow he got down to me.
[2:09:29] Somehow he got this voice to me. Somehow
[2:09:32] I heard it. Something was in me that
[2:09:35] believed it. Something kept making it
[2:09:38] alive to me and alive to me. When I
[2:09:40] first heard the message, everything I
[2:09:42] read was would pop up. He said, "You go
[2:09:45] home at work time and some lady's out
[2:09:47] there mowing her lawn in shorts."
[2:09:50] I listen to that and go up there and
[2:09:52] sure enough there's a lady mowing her
[2:09:55] lawn and short. What was that? That was
[2:09:59] the Holy
[2:10:00] Spirit making this
[2:10:03] alive. Making it alive. Bringing it
[2:10:07] alive. Let me see it in my life. Let me
[2:10:10] see that it was real. Making every
[2:10:12] promise in this book come to life.
[2:10:20] And that's what his spirit's here to
[2:10:23] do is make every promise in this book
[2:10:26] come to life for
[2:10:28] you. And when you recognize your
[2:10:34] call, maybe I want to use a word. I I
[2:10:37] wish I could find one so you don't
[2:10:38] confuse calling like what your ministry
[2:10:44] might be to being
[2:10:51] called. Well, when you receded
[2:10:54] out, I don't care how he brought you, he
[2:10:58] brought
[2:10:59] you. How did he get you from a corn
[2:11:03] field to his
[2:11:06] word? You tell me. Who orchestrated
[2:11:10] that? Who put that together? You know
[2:11:13] what he tried to let us know? He went as
[2:11:15] far as back to get your great
[2:11:17] greatgrandfather to marry your great
[2:11:19] grandmother. He protected that seed all
[2:11:22] the way down till you got here.
[2:11:29] He wants us to have
[2:11:32] faith in the
[2:11:35] potential that is in
[2:11:39] us. Faith in what that we have. We don't
[2:11:42] have it because we earned it. We have it
[2:11:44] because he gave it to
[2:11:47] us. You say, "Well, I don't got it." I
[2:11:50] said, "Did you did he call you?"
[2:11:53] Yes. Did you know this was right? Yes.
[2:11:57] That was the Holy Spirit working on you,
[2:12:00] calling you, bringing you, pulling you.
[2:12:02] You think he's going to stop.
[2:12:05] No. Have faith in
[2:12:09] that. If you're a sinner this morning,
[2:12:11] you're smoking, you're drinking, you're
[2:12:13] shooting drugs, you just went to the
[2:12:15] bathroom and took four or five shots of
[2:12:17] of this or that. I don't care. It don't
[2:12:19] matter how bad of a sinner is. If all of
[2:12:22] a sudden that spirit
[2:12:25] convicts your heart
[2:12:27] and you know you're wrong and you know
[2:12:30] this right, that's the spirit of God
[2:12:32] calling you. If you had faith in that
[2:12:35] and you believe that, that would perform
[2:12:37] a change in you.
[2:12:47] The liar is a liar. Satan's a liar. He's
[2:12:50] never going to tell you that that you're
[2:12:53] a
[2:12:55] Christian cuz he don't believe
[2:12:58] it. But if you could just come to the
[2:13:01] place where we could just look at how
[2:13:05] that he's chose
[2:13:07] us, look how he called us. If we could
[2:13:10] recognize the call. Pentecost saw the
[2:13:14] prophet of God stand there person after
[2:13:16] person discern their thoughts heal the
[2:13:18] blind raise the dead do miracle after
[2:13:21] miracle after miracle and they didn't
[2:13:24] see what you
[2:13:29] see and yet blessed is he who has not
[2:13:33] seen and yet
[2:13:38] believe I sat with those men God gave be
[2:13:42] the
[2:13:44] blessing to be able to sit with many,
[2:13:47] many of the
[2:13:49] people that knew Brother Brandham
[2:13:53] personally, spend time with him, sit
[2:13:55] down and
[2:13:57] listen, and every time I'd hear him
[2:13:59] talk, I I I'm I was amazed at how few
[2:14:04] people What did that? Why do you
[2:14:08] believe? Can't you have faith?
[2:14:12] and how he chose you, how he brought
[2:14:15] you, how he found
[2:14:20] you. It's amazing if you start listening
[2:14:23] to everybody's
[2:14:24] testimony. He
[2:14:26] says, he says, you recognize its call.
[2:14:32] You recognize it's called that and you
[2:14:35] know the hour you're living and you know
[2:14:38] these things are supposed to happen
[2:14:42] quickly. You're raptured up to meet it.
[2:14:47] And now you're sitting in heavenly
[2:14:49] places in Christ Jesus. What a promise.
[2:14:53] What a heavenly father who would give us
[2:14:58] these things.
[2:15:04] Oh, I I if I I just go back through. He
[2:15:07] says you are quickened and this
[2:15:10] quickening power brings your body into
[2:15:13] rapturing
[2:15:16] condition. Remember he said you grow
[2:15:19] into
[2:15:22] it. That that's so it it's so beautiful
[2:15:27] uh this morning. Maybe I'm just
[2:15:30] just
[2:15:32] uh you
[2:15:35] know too much into it. But I I just love
[2:15:40] the thing. I don't know where that that
[2:15:43] statement was, but he talked about
[2:15:45] growing into it and you know about the
[2:15:48] oak tree and how you just grow into it.
[2:15:50] You know, it's amazing. We're we it's
[2:15:54] not that we're
[2:15:57] there. is that we have faith in what's
[2:16:01] in us will bring us
[2:16:04] there. That's where God wants your
[2:16:06] faith. He wants your faith in the spirit
[2:16:09] that's in you will do what it did.
[2:16:12] That's where Abraham's faith was.
[2:16:14] Abraham didn't have the evidence in his
[2:16:16] flesh.
[2:16:19] He didn't have the evidence in
[2:16:22] Sarah. He didn't have the evidence
[2:16:24] anywhere. He had the evidence in one
[2:16:27] thing and that was a
[2:16:30] promise. And he believed that if God
[2:16:33] gave him the
[2:16:35] promise then that God was able to
[2:16:39] perform that which he promised.
[2:16:43] So if he gave you his
[2:16:48] spirit, other words, if you accepted his
[2:16:52] spirit, you want his spirit, you want
[2:16:54] us, you get down and you pray, "Father,
[2:16:57] I want the same spirit that raised up
[2:17:01] Jesus Christ to come in
[2:17:03] me. I'm willing to lay my life down for
[2:17:07] it. I'm willing to change whatever you
[2:17:09] do, but I've been baptized in your name.
[2:17:12] And you said if I was baptized in the
[2:17:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that I
[2:17:16] would receive the same spirit that
[2:17:19] raised him
[2:17:21] up. And when you know when that spirit
[2:17:25] strikes
[2:17:27] you, then you don't have
[2:17:31] faith in something you don't. You have
[2:17:35] faith in the
[2:17:37] potential that's in
[2:17:41] you. You
[2:17:44] believe that what you have will do what
[2:17:49] it says it'll do.
[2:17:54] And now your
[2:17:57] decisions are
[2:17:59] made based on the
[2:18:02] potential that's in
[2:18:04] you. Your decisions aren't made, they're
[2:18:08] not driven by any circumstance around
[2:18:11] you. Your life is now controlled by the
[2:18:14] potential, the abstract that you have,
[2:18:18] the possession that you have. There's
[2:18:20] nothing laid against you. There's no
[2:18:23] reason that you can't take possession of
[2:18:25] this land. There's no reason you can't
[2:18:27] build on this land. There's no reason
[2:18:30] you can't walk in this land. There's no
[2:18:32] reason you can't travel to one corner of
[2:18:35] this land to the other. It's
[2:18:38] yours. And there's a whole spiritual
[2:18:41] land of promises and victory and power
[2:18:45] for the believer that they're not even
[2:18:48] walking in.
[2:18:50] It's like they're not
[2:18:51] sure it's
[2:18:55] theirs. Well, so how can I be sure it's
[2:19:00] I hope I'll just say this and finish
[2:19:02] this morning. How can I be sure it's
[2:19:05] mine? I look back at how that it came to
[2:19:14] me. I didn't ask for it. I didn't seek
[2:19:18] it. He brought it to me. And if he found
[2:19:22] me, convicted me, and brought it to me,
[2:19:25] then why can't I believe it's him? And
[2:19:28] if I can believe it's
[2:19:31] him, then he and he gave
[2:19:35] me. And he says, "By this
[2:19:38] spirit that I put in you, I will raise
[2:19:42] you up by that same spirit that dwells
[2:19:44] in you. By that same spirit, you shall
[2:19:48] ask the Father anything in my name, and
[2:19:51] he'll grant it to you. By that same
[2:19:53] spirit, you shall lay your hands on the
[2:19:55] sick, and they shall recover. By that
[2:19:57] same spirit, you shall cast out devils.
[2:19:59] Even the devils in your own life, you
[2:20:02] cast them
[2:20:05] out. You take possession
[2:20:10] over the gates of the enemy by what?
[2:20:17] by just the
[2:20:20] potential. So he say am I resurrected?
[2:20:23] Yes. Why am I resurrected? Because I
[2:20:26] have in me what's going to resurrect
[2:20:33] me. I believe in
[2:20:36] that. And if and I can look back how he
[2:20:40] brought the messenger into life. how he
[2:20:43] brought the messenger on the scene, how
[2:20:45] that he called me, how that he found me,
[2:20:48] how how that I had it in just a form of
[2:20:52] a of an an oak seed and and how that I
[2:20:57] just kept rising up and kept growing up
[2:20:59] and and growing in potential and and and
[2:21:03] and moving up and just watched the whole
[2:21:06] process of of of it coming. Do where is
[2:21:10] that quote I just read? We just heard it
[2:21:12] about the
[2:21:13] oak
[2:21:15] seed. Can you find that? I It's right in
[2:21:18] front of my eyes here. I know, but I
[2:21:20] can't I can't find
[2:21:22] it. I thought I even put a check on it.
[2:21:26] I want to read that just in closing this
[2:21:29] morning.
[2:21:31] What? 94.
[2:21:40] Oh, no
[2:21:47] wonder.
[2:21:49] 94. Yes. Like if you ask me for an oak
[2:21:53] tree and I give you an
[2:21:56] acorn, the life of the oak tree is in
[2:22:00] the acorn now. But you have to wait till
[2:22:04] it grew
[2:22:06] up. But the life was in it. How Remember
[2:22:10] we talked about the life, the
[2:22:12] transforming power of God. So we're
[2:22:14] talking about going forward. So it's
[2:22:17] time to let the transforming
[2:22:20] power that God put in us to start
[2:22:25] letting us take possession of the land
[2:22:29] that is
[2:22:32] ours. Not trying to produce it.
[2:22:37] Not trying to read it and doesn't go
[2:22:39] make it happen, but have
[2:22:43] faith that the life that's in the seed
[2:22:47] is going to grow
[2:22:50] into what that it was planted to grow
[2:22:55] into. Now, if we can believe that and
[2:22:58] have faith in it, then it will believe
[2:23:00] it. But we don't keep running out trying
[2:23:04] to create something. We let what's in us
[2:23:09] perform its own
[2:23:12] creation. Is that simple
[2:23:17] enough? So do we. When we receive the
[2:23:21] Holy Spirit of God, it's God's
[2:23:24] potential waiting upon you that's
[2:23:29] already recognized
[2:23:31] you. It already recognized you.
[2:23:35] He recognized me in California that I
[2:23:37] was one as his. So he sent the Holy
[2:23:39] Spirit to find
[2:23:42] me and he started working on me, working
[2:23:44] on me, working on me, working on
[2:23:47] me. And you were sealed by the spirit of
[2:23:50] promise of God into the body of Christ.
[2:23:54] And when God looked down at Calvary and
[2:23:57] seen Jesus dying, he died for his bride,
[2:24:01] the body, which is the word church. And
[2:24:05] the church that believed the word of God
[2:24:07] for the age, whether it's feet, body,
[2:24:10] head, whatever, Christ was bleeding and
[2:24:13] dying. And God looked upon him and saw
[2:24:16] his resurrection and the church raised
[2:24:18] with him on Easter. Now, I want you to
[2:24:21] get all this together because I got
[2:24:24] something a little bit I want to say to
[2:24:26] you, Lord willing. Now, notice it's the
[2:24:29] earnest or the potential, the quickening
[2:24:33] power of the resurrection when you
[2:24:36] receive the Holy Spirit is then dwelling
[2:24:39] in you. the potential of it. Notice, you
[2:24:44] are now on your way growing to the full
[2:24:50] resurrection.
[2:24:57] You're on your
[2:24:58] way. Oh, can you imagine when we can get
[2:25:01] so sure of it that we can start saying,
[2:25:04] "I'm on my
[2:25:06] way. The things I choose because this is
[2:25:09] where I'm going. I'm not going to the
[2:25:11] world. I'm not going to this place. I'm
[2:25:14] not doing that. I'm not doing this. This
[2:25:16] is my land. This is where I'm going to
[2:25:19] live. I'm going to live in the land of
[2:25:20] faith. I'm going to live in the land of
[2:25:23] promise. I've been called to it. It's
[2:25:25] potentially it's growing in me. And then
[2:25:28] you sit back and and he says he
[2:25:32] says, and notice now you're you're on
[2:25:35] your way. You're going to the full
[2:25:37] resurrection. No tree just comes up
[2:25:40] overnight. It's got to grow as we grow
[2:25:44] in the grace and knowledge of
[2:25:48] God. So look, there there's no need for
[2:25:51] us to keep beating ourselves. You got
[2:25:53] the Holy Ghost. Are you born again? If
[2:25:56] you're born again, if you're born, wait
[2:25:58] a minute. If I got the Holy Ghost, I'm
[2:25:59] going to overcome.
[2:26:04] This might be bothering me. This must
[2:26:06] make me weak. This is my failure. But
[2:26:08] you know something? What's in me is
[2:26:11] greater than he who is in the
[2:26:16] world. I know I didn't do
[2:26:19] this. I know I didn't choose this. I
[2:26:22] know I didn't call. I know he called me.
[2:26:25] I know this is him. I know I'm
[2:26:28] growing. He says growing to the full
[2:26:31] resurrection.
[2:26:33] You are baptized into the Holy Spirit.
[2:26:36] Now, as the Pentecostal Church baptized
[2:26:39] into the Holy Spirit, it's be it's
[2:26:42] begins growing. Limbs have died. They're
[2:26:46] pr pruned off, but the tree is still
[2:26:48] growing. It's still grow going on
[2:26:52] because it's got to come to the
[2:26:55] resurrection.
[2:26:57] They they're led by the spirit to
[2:27:01] quicken the word to you who is
[2:27:04] believers. The world keeps the word
[2:27:07] keeps
[2:27:10] quickening. It keeps
[2:27:17] quickening. I want to say that again. It
[2:27:19] keeps
[2:27:21] quickening. It's about change. It's
[2:27:24] about growing. It's about moving
[2:27:27] up. It's not about the trickery that
[2:27:31] Satan put on us saying you should
[2:27:34] already have
[2:27:38] it because
[2:27:40] then we're re we're in a negative
[2:27:47] viewpoint. It isn't that I should
[2:27:50] already possess it. I have it.
[2:27:53] It's growing in me.
[2:27:56] I'm coming. I'm moving. I'm growing. I'm
[2:27:59] going. It keeps quickening. Keep
[2:28:02] quickening. It's cutting limbs off. It's
[2:28:04] doing this. I'm moving up. Why? I have
[2:28:09] faith in what he planted in me. I have
[2:28:14] faith in what he brought to life. I have
[2:28:18] faith in the way he brought me this
[2:28:20] word. I have faith in the way he found
[2:28:22] me. I have faith that he found me. I
[2:28:25] didn't find him. I have faith that he
[2:28:28] drawed
[2:28:30] me. I believe it. And I believe if he
[2:28:34] started it, he'll finish
[2:28:38] it. And I don't place my
[2:28:42] faith by trying to muster up something I
[2:28:45] don't have.
[2:28:48] I don't try to judge my faith by
[2:28:50] producing something I don't have. I
[2:28:53] believe in what I do
[2:28:56] have. And I believe that what I do have
[2:29:00] will perform the work that it has
[2:29:04] potential to
[2:29:09] perform. And I believe
[2:29:12] it. And I think he wants every one of
[2:29:15] you to believe this morning that he
[2:29:17] called you to this message. He found
[2:29:20] you. He brought it. He looked for you.
[2:29:24] He chose
[2:29:26] you. And he didn't do that to lose
[2:29:29] you. All the father hath given me will
[2:29:35] come. Just let the word keep
[2:29:39] quickening. Keep bringing the scriptures
[2:29:41] to life. Have
[2:29:44] faith
[2:29:47] in recognizing your
[2:29:54] call. He says grows because it's got to
[2:29:58] come to a resurrection. They're led by
[2:30:00] the spirit to quicken the word to you
[2:30:03] who is believers.
[2:30:06] They're led by the spirit to quicken the
[2:30:09] word to you who is believers. The word
[2:30:13] keeps quickening as you come to the
[2:30:16] first limb, second limb, third limb on
[2:30:19] up. It just keeps quickening. The spirit
[2:30:24] of God keeps
[2:30:26] quickening
[2:30:29] you. That's the relationship.
[2:30:32] And I I hope this morning you
[2:30:36] believe you could walk out of here this
[2:30:38] morning and say, "I know God called me
[2:30:40] to this
[2:30:41] message. I know he put his spirit in me
[2:30:45] and I know that spirit's going to bring
[2:30:47] take me to the resurrection. And now my
[2:30:51] decision makingaking in life is not
[2:30:53] based on the world around me, but it's
[2:30:58] based on what's in me and where it's
[2:31:02] taking me. And I I I maybe you could go
[2:31:06] back and study these things because the
[2:31:09] it's it's so beautiful to realize that
[2:31:13] and maybe for me especially that you
[2:31:17] know
[2:31:18] something he chose
[2:31:21] me I didn't choose
[2:31:24] him and he opened my eyes to it and he
[2:31:28] gave me eyes and I don't care what a
[2:31:31] failure I am you will never be able to
[2:31:34] take away what he did.
[2:31:36] And if he did it, Yes, sir. it will
[2:31:40] overcome every single
[2:31:46] battle. It'll fix marriages. It'll fix
[2:31:50] sickness. It'll fix families. There is
[2:31:54] nothing that's impossible for God.
[2:31:58] There is nothing that can possible if
[2:32:02] we'll start
[2:32:03] believing in what God put in us.
[2:32:10] And you say,
[2:32:12] "Well, how I'll say it again in trying
[2:32:15] to make this sink
[2:32:18] in. How do I
[2:32:21] know it's
[2:32:23] there?" By how it got there.
[2:32:31] It was
[2:32:34] there. When I heard this voice, there
[2:32:37] was something
[2:32:40] there. When I got convicted of sin,
[2:32:44] there was something in
[2:32:47] there that I didn't even know it was in
[2:32:50] there.
[2:32:52] I wouldn't have even put it in there.
[2:32:56] But it was
[2:32:58] there. And you can't rob that from me,
[2:33:01] Satan. No matter how bad I fall, I
[2:33:05] didn't put it there. It was already
[2:33:07] there. I didn't respond. It
[2:33:12] responded. I didn't make the changes in
[2:33:15] my life. It made the changes in my life.
[2:33:18] It's been quickening me and bringing the
[2:33:22] word to life and changing me. And if it
[2:33:25] brought me and changed me and grow me
[2:33:27] up, it's going to continue to change me
[2:33:29] and bring me up till I'm doing and
[2:33:33] possessing and walking in the land of
[2:33:38] promise that I've been promised to walk
[2:33:41] in by
[2:33:43] faith. Uh we are going to go in. We
[2:33:46] don't have to produce the signs. We will
[2:33:49] bear it because it's our nature. Because
[2:33:53] the Holy Spirit has moved in us and
[2:33:56] created in us and is performing and
[2:33:59] doing because our names are written on
[2:34:02] the lamb's book of life before the
[2:34:04] foundation of the world. that he saw us
[2:34:08] already. And he came
[2:34:12] down and went out over us with the great
[2:34:15] eagle
[2:34:17] scream to gather us up that we can
[2:34:22] receive and sit in heavenly places in
[2:34:26] Christ Jesus. And and I thank God and I
[2:34:29] thank God for how he called me and I I
[2:34:34] believe that he did it. And because he
[2:34:37] did
[2:34:40] it, I can trust it and I can have faith
[2:34:45] in it.
[2:34:47] And I I hope that that you can
[2:34:51] understand
[2:34:52] because we can't just keep going back
[2:34:55] church over and over and over again
[2:34:58] about the baptism of the Holy
[2:35:02] Ghost. We'll never get
[2:35:07] anywhere. We'll never get anywhere
[2:35:09] because when one side shouts, the other
[2:35:12] side feels condemned.
[2:35:18] And then we'll all have definitions of
[2:35:20] the Holy Ghost. We'll all have
[2:35:22] definitions of being born
[2:35:25] again. But there's one thing I know we
[2:35:28] all have in
[2:35:30] common is he chose
[2:35:33] us. And if each of you will examine your
[2:35:36] heart and say, "I know God dealt with my
[2:35:40] heart. I know this is true. I might have
[2:35:42] been raised in it. My daddy might have
[2:35:44] been a preacher that all my time, but I
[2:35:46] I know for myself. I know it's real. And
[2:35:49] you know that's the Holy
[2:35:51] Spirit. Then you can just
[2:35:54] say, "Oh spirit that moved on me,
[2:35:58] continue the work in me. Grow me into
[2:36:02] confidence of the baptism. Grow me up a
[2:36:05] little higher. Grow me to another limb.
[2:36:09] Grow me up. I know you chose me. I know
[2:36:11] you called me. and I know you'll do the
[2:36:14] work that's in me. And I don't care what
[2:36:16] anybody else says. I know I'm not the
[2:36:18] best preacher in the land. But I'll tell
[2:36:20] you one thing. I thank God I got a
[2:36:22] prophet messenger that I can play to
[2:36:26] you that can lay it out to
[2:36:29] you and you can see yourself.
[2:36:34] You can see that what he preached, the
[2:36:37] spirit of God quickened and shows you
[2:36:41] that that actually happened to
[2:36:47] you. Tommy, how did you get from having
[2:36:50] three six-packs of empty beer cans in
[2:36:53] the back of your
[2:36:57] car? We just go through this room.
[2:37:03] John Beal listen to radio stations. Some
[2:37:05] guy mentioned Brother Bram's name. He
[2:37:08] goes and looks it
[2:37:10] up. We can go through page after page
[2:37:14] after page after page after
[2:37:17] page because it wasn't
[2:37:21] us. It was him. Because he put something
[2:37:24] in us. And when are we gonna have
[2:37:27] faith in the
[2:37:32] potential? If you plant a seed, don't
[2:37:34] you
[2:37:35] believe that that seed's going to do
[2:37:37] what it does to do? God's got faith in
[2:37:41] you. Can you have faith in
[2:37:44] yourself? Can you have faith in the way
[2:37:47] that you were
[2:37:49] called and know
[2:37:56] You say, "How do you know?" Because I
[2:37:59] know and I
[2:38:01] recognized it was
[2:38:03] him that called. And if he called, he'll
[2:38:08] answer. God bless you this morning.
[2:38:11] Musicians, you
[2:38:20] come. Amen. And aren't you glad he
[2:38:22] called you? Amen. He who began the work
[2:38:26] will finish it. Man, I was reading the
[2:38:28] prophet said somewhere I said as we are
[2:38:31] here the element the the the the very
[2:38:34] element that's going to eat your body is
[2:38:36] already in you. You don't have to worry
[2:38:39] about it when you die. The very worms
[2:38:42] that's going to eat your body is already
[2:38:44] in you. But this morning we just heard
[2:38:46] that the element of the rapture already
[2:38:48] in you also. Amen. Isn't that a
[2:38:51] blessing? Let's all stand. Amen.
[2:38:57] Hallelujah. Oh, pour your spirit out on
[2:39:02] me fall just like the rain. Oh, s.

[2:40:54] places. Thirsting for

[2:41:01] love. Oh, and Lord, forive
[2:41:06] me if I wonder.

[2:42:51] Oh, and I I need you
[2:42:55] now for your spirit.
[2:43:04] I've been changed.

[2:43:16] Oh, and
[2:43:20] deliver. I
[2:43:24] found
[2:43:28] Oh,
[2:43:30] and your testimony this morning. Oh, and
[2:43:34] favor.
[2:43:39] And right now is a moment.
[2:43:44] Today is the day I've been
[2:43:50] changed. I've been
[2:43:54] changed. I have
[2:43:57] waited. Yes, I waited for this moment to
[2:44:02] come. And I won't let it
[2:44:07] pass
[2:44:10] by. Oh, and I I won't go back. I can't
[2:44:16] go back. Oh, to the way you used to be.
[2:44:22] For your presence came and changed me.

[2:54:17] just come in this recess this morning.
[2:54:21] Amen.
[2:54:26] Amen.
[2:54:31] Amen. You've been blessed to be in the
[2:54:33] house of the Lord today.
[2:54:37] Amen. As we heard Wednesday night,
[2:54:39] there's a lot going on with this book.
[2:54:43] It's the greatest love story it's ever
[2:54:45] been told.
[2:54:47] And the author is a principal
[2:54:56] character. And through pestilence,
[2:54:58] storm,
[2:55:00] uprisings, denials, coups,
[2:55:03] everything that
[2:55:05] character is going to get his
[2:55:10] reward. We are his reward.
[2:55:14] I want to take a moment to just say once
[2:55:17] again how I appreciate the Sunday school
[2:55:19] teachers, the
[2:55:21] helpers. Uh we had a good day yesterday
[2:55:25] celebrating the benefits of the
[2:55:27] pavilion. Appreciate those that worked
[2:55:29] so hard and labored.
[2:55:32] Uh we just look forward to
[2:55:35] uh to next year.
[2:55:38] If you don't have a child registered and
[2:55:40] then they're turning four years old, you
[2:55:42] can sign them up and those that are
[2:55:45] turning 13 will be moving on to the
[2:55:46] youth group. But, uh, it's an investment
[2:55:50] we have in our children. I think it's a
[2:55:52] worthy cause. We put them in and get
[2:55:55] instruction and and benefits of of just
[2:55:58] coming together worshiping the Lord even
[2:56:00] at that young age. So, uh, let's just
[2:56:04] bow our heads.
[2:56:07] Gracious and kind heavenly father, Lord,
[2:56:10] we do thank you for the expression we've
[2:56:11] heard this morning of how truly Lord
[2:56:15] that you sought
[2:56:17] us. Lord, you found us
[2:56:21] worthy when we didn't consider ourselves
[2:56:26] worthy. And Lord
[2:56:31] truly if we are your reward Lord you're
[2:56:34] going to preserve us all. There won't be
[2:56:36] a one
[2:56:37] lost Lord for each one of us in the
[2:56:41] beginning were a part of you that would
[2:56:43] make you
[2:56:44] incomplete. And Lord you are a
[2:56:50] full godhead. Lord, as we realize it was
[2:56:54] come in the form of a
[2:56:58] savior, you Paul said it was the Godhead
[2:57:03] bodily made manifest in our midst. And
[2:57:06] Lord, if we want to see you today, we
[2:57:09] look around. You are in our midst.
[2:57:11] You're in each one of us. May we act and
[2:57:14] perform that way, Lord. As we heard
[2:57:17] today, we're growing into that bride
[2:57:19] tree, Lord.
[2:57:20] Lord, grant it to us as we go from here
[2:57:22] that these words can just burn within
[2:57:26] us, Lord. Just build us up, we pray. Use
[2:57:29] them to straighten our path, Lord, to
[2:57:32] get back where we're supposed to be.
[2:57:34] It's needful, Lord, to hear things that
[2:57:37] sometimes are cutting and convicting.
[2:57:40] But Lord, we know where we fail. We ask
[2:57:42] you just help us to do better. Lord, as
[2:57:46] we go from here, we want to take you
[2:57:47] with us. May we have a smile on our
[2:57:50] face, a joy in our heart, Lord, that
[2:57:51] only you can provide. Lord, may we greet
[2:57:54] each other and recognize the benefits,
[2:57:57] Lord, of being under the umbrella of
[2:58:00] this message. Lord, there's a divine
[2:58:03] love within us, Lord, that the world is
[2:58:05] longing for. And we're the only people
[2:58:09] that can truly express and have it.
[2:58:12] Lord, we thank you and praise you now.
[2:58:15] As we lift your name up, we ask all
[2:58:17] these things in the name of the Lord
[2:58:18] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:58:23] Amen. God bless you, brother Smith. Man,
[2:58:26] don't forget those that play instruments
[2:58:28] that like to help. If you can be
[2:58:29] gathering the fellowship, that would be
[2:58:31] awesome. Amen. right after service this
[2:58:37] morning. Beyond this
[2:58:41] flesh that you can see
[2:58:44] now, beyond all
[2:58:47] weaknesses of this
[2:58:49] friend, there is a
[2:58:53] connection
[2:58:55] invisible with the other side.
[2:58:59] [Music]
[2:59:02] Oh, I don't know
[2:59:05] how. I don't know why. I cannot
[2:59:10] explain the love of God for my soul down
[2:59:15] inside of me. When I hear the
[2:59:19] word, my heart
[2:59:22] says,
[2:59:23] [Music]
[2:59:25] "Amen." I say, "Amen.
[2:59:31] Oh, and beyond this
[2:59:35] place that you can see now. Oh, and
[2:59:39] beyond all
[2:59:41] witnesses of this
[2:59:44] realm, there is a
[2:59:47] connection. Oh,
[2:59:50] invisible with Jesus Christ.
[2:59:56] Oh, I don't know
[2:59:59] how. I don't know why. I cannot
[3:00:05] explain the love of God for my soul down
[3:00:10] inside of me. When I hear the
[3:00:14] word, my heart
[3:00:16] says,
[3:00:18] [Music]
[3:00:20] "Amen." I say, "Amen.
[3:00:26] [Music]
