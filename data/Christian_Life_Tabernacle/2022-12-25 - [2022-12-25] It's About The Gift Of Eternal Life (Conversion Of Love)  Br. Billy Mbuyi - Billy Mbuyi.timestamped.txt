[16:30] Christmas God bless you as we remember
[16:32] the mic for for some reason
[16:42] Merry Christmas
[16:56] Merry Christmas everyone
[17:00] I didn't get a chance to tell anyone on
[17:02] my way in so I'm just telling you all
[17:03] hey man
[17:05] you know Christmas is
[17:07] just thinking about it the other night
[17:09] you know Christmas is probably one of
[17:11] the most
[17:12] globally recognized and celebrated
[17:15] holidays of the year
[17:18] I don't know that they may celebrate it
[17:20] in different ways and
[17:22] you know focus on different things but
[17:25] pretty much don't have to tell anybody
[17:27] what Christmas is
[17:29] everybody knows what Christmas is
[17:33] and
[17:34] you know most folks have at least heard
[17:37] some version of the story
[17:41] if for no other reason than they've seen
[17:43] decorations somewhere they're vaguely
[17:45] aware that it involves a baby
[17:48] that was born and
[17:51] you know even if that's all they know
[17:54] that's you know certainly well enough
[17:56] for them to build a worldwide holiday
[18:00] around
[18:02] you know I got to thinking about that
[18:04] and what's interesting is
[18:06] in spite of how popular Christmas is
[18:09] today
[18:11] at the time
[18:13] that great event happened
[18:16] almost nobody noticed
[18:19] you know they
[18:21] what's recognized by everyone today
[18:24] back then
[18:26] it was just another day
[18:28] nobody had any idea that there was any
[18:30] work of God
[18:33] being done
[18:34] in their midst outside of the handful of
[18:37] folks that the Lord
[18:39] chose to make it known
[18:42] it was
[18:43] you know
[18:45] nobody saw any difference in their day
[18:48] or in the things that they worried about
[18:49] or their day-to-day lives
[18:54] you know and you know it's even more
[18:56] interesting is even when a group came
[18:58] and directly questioned a king
[19:02] you know about where this was supposed
[19:04] to happen the religious leaders of the
[19:05] day
[19:07] you know we're very very quick to be
[19:10] able to say well this is what's supposed
[19:12] to happen
[19:13] but they still didn't recognize it was
[19:16] happening
[19:19] you know it wasn't a globally televised
[19:22] streamed event
[19:24] that everybody saw and was aware that a
[19:27] birth had happened and that a work of
[19:29] God was underway
[19:31] they just didn't recognize it they just
[19:35] didn't know it
[19:38] you know they came and went about their
[19:39] normal lives as anybody does
[19:43] you know and really from the moment of
[19:45] his appearing back 2000 years ago
[19:49] until the moment that he gave his life
[19:52] on a cross
[19:55] really
[19:56] except again just for a handful of folks
[19:59] it went totally unnoticed
[20:04] you know I think that
[20:07] you know brings to mind some of the
[20:08] things that brother Branham preached
[20:11] things like
[20:14] the presence of God unrecognized
[20:17] things like one in a million
[20:21] and you know I was just thinking about
[20:23] here you have Christmas with the whole
[20:25] world celebrating this great event
[20:29] but outside of the hand of God
[20:32] nobody noticed what he did
[20:35] you know and I was just you know
[20:37] thinking about that and we turned to
[20:40] Psalm 85 this morning
[20:44] was a reading Psalm 85 and here you have
[20:46] the witness
[20:48] of the sons of Korah
[20:50] a group of people among the Israelites
[20:55] and if you read as we read that chapter
[20:56] this morning they are
[20:58] truly laying out
[21:01] the work that God
[21:03] was to do in the Earth
[21:06] even hundreds of years before it even
[21:07] happened
[21:09] and you have a people that are able to
[21:11] perceive
[21:13] and to see
[21:15] what his hand would do
[21:18] even when all those that lived in the
[21:21] day that it actually happened
[21:23] were not aware that anything was
[21:25] happening
[21:27] you know if we look at a few of the
[21:29] verses he says verse 2 thou Hast
[21:30] forgiven the iniquity of thy people
[21:34] thou has covered all their sin
[21:36] thou has taken away all thy Wrath
[21:40] thou has turned thyself from the
[21:42] fierceness of thine anger
[21:44] turn us o God of our salvation
[21:49] verse 8 I will hear what God the Lord
[21:52] will speak
[21:54] for he will speak peace
[21:57] unto his people
[21:59] this could almost be
[22:02] them witnessing the event that God was
[22:05] doing when a baby was born
[22:08] and here they are hundreds of years
[22:09] removed from that
[22:12] you know Paul said it this way in
[22:14] Colossians 1 and verse 20 and having
[22:16] made peace
[22:18] through the blood of his cross
[22:20] by him to reconcile all things unto
[22:23] himself
[22:25] and you that were sometimes alienated
[22:27] and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works
[22:29] yet now hath he reconciled
[22:32] in the body of his flesh through death
[22:35] to present you holy and unblameable
[22:39] and unreprovable in his sight
[22:42] you know it just struck me how you have
[22:44] folks hundreds of years from when it
[22:46] happened
[22:48] knowing what the work of God would do
[22:51] And yet when the work of God came to do
[22:54] it nobody in that day saw it
[22:58] except for those to whom he revealed it
[23:00] I think of Simeon who's standing in a
[23:03] crowded Temple a whole line of babies to
[23:06] be dedicated to the Lord
[23:08] and somehow he lays his eyes on one
[23:12] and he says mine eyes have seen
[23:15] thy salvation which thou has prepared
[23:19] before the face
[23:21] of all people
[23:23] you know and as I was thinking about
[23:25] that and as we read Psalm 85 how
[23:30] precious it is
[23:31] to have noticed to have been made to
[23:35] notice
[23:36] to have been caused to recognize the
[23:38] work of God
[23:40] because for the vast majority of those
[23:44] in this day
[23:45] it's just another day
[23:48] the presence of God the work of God
[23:50] completely unnoticed completely
[23:52] unrecognized
[23:54] you know it says in verse
[23:57] 13 of Psalm 85 righteousness shall go
[24:00] before him and Shall Set us in the way
[24:03] of his steps
[24:07] they might as well have been quoting
[24:08] Ephesians 2. in verse 10 which said for
[24:11] we are his workmanship
[24:14] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[24:17] righteousness
[24:19] which God hath before ordained that we
[24:23] should walk in them
[24:25] the way of his steps
[24:29] you know
[24:30] as we celebrate this whereas the world
[24:34] celebrates this great work
[24:36] that God did one day
[24:39] you know I don't know about you but I'm
[24:41] grateful that
[24:43] I'm able to see
[24:45] that he has caused me to notice
[24:48] that he has caused me to reconcile
[24:50] recognize and turn aside to see this
[24:53] thing
[24:54] that God is doing when everyone else is
[24:57] just another day
[25:00] you know and to me I mean I I enjoy
[25:03] Christmas I think we all do I think it's
[25:05] a wonderful time of year but to me it's
[25:07] just a reminder
[25:09] of how precious it is that he's given us
[25:12] eyes to see
[25:13] that it's just not another unnoticed
[25:16] work
[25:19] you know and I'm so grateful that
[25:21] there's a handful of folks Simeon
[25:24] Zechariah the sons of Korah who knew
[25:27] something about Redemption
[25:29] we're able to perceive
[25:31] the work that God is doing so as we read
[25:33] you know Psalm 85 this morning
[25:36] the Christmas story according to the
[25:38] sons of Korah
[25:40] let's just thank the Lord that he's
[25:42] given us eyes that we might see his hand
[25:44] extended
[25:46] let's read that together verse one Lord
[25:48] thou has been favorable unto thy land
[25:51] thou has brought back the Captivity of
[25:53] Jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of
[25:56] thy people thou has covered all their
[25:59] sin sealing thou has taken away all thy
[26:02] wrath thou has turned thyself from the
[26:04] fierceness of thine anger turn us o God
[26:07] of our salvation and cause thine anger
[26:10] toward us to cease will thou be angry
[26:13] with us forever wilt thou draw out thine
[26:16] anger to all generations will thou not
[26:18] revive us again that thy people may
[26:21] rejoice in thee show us thy mercy O Lord
[26:24] and grant us thy salvation I will hear
[26:27] what God the Lord will speak for he will
[26:30] speak peace unto his people and to his
[26:32] Saints but let them not turn again to
[26:35] Folly surely his salvation is neither
[26:38] them that fear Him That Glory May dwell
[26:40] in our land mercy and Truth are met
[26:43] together righteousness and peace have
[26:45] kissed each other truth shall spring out
[26:48] of the earth and righteousness shall
[26:50] look down from heaven yea the Lord shall
[26:53] give that which is good and our land
[26:55] shall yield her Increase righteousness
[26:58] shall go before him and Shall Set us in
[27:01] the way of his steps amen
[27:07] amen God bless you you may have your
[27:08] Saints

[1:10:49] man I thought of this scripture that
[1:10:51] came to my heart in Psalm 127 it says
[1:10:55] accept the Lord buildeth a house they
[1:10:58] delivered in a day that labor in vain
[1:11:00] that built it except the Lord kept the
[1:11:04] city The Watchmen watches in vain it is
[1:11:07] vain for you to rise up early and sit up
[1:11:10] late to eat bread of Sorrow for it's he
[1:11:14] that giveth his beloved sleep he said
[1:11:18] Lord children are inheritance of the
[1:11:20] Lord and the fruits of the womb is is
[1:11:23] its reward as errors are in the hand of
[1:11:27] a mighty man so are children of the
[1:11:30] youth he says happy is a man that had
[1:11:33] his quiver full of him he says they
[1:11:36] shall not not be ashamed but shall speak
[1:11:40] with the Enemy at the Gate amen I
[1:11:43] thought this morning that you mean as we
[1:11:45] pray
[1:11:47] for the baby's name is
[1:11:50] Sylvia Elaine benini so we pray this
[1:11:54] morning that says the Lord will
[1:11:55] certainly
[1:11:56] bless her and certainly be with us that
[1:11:59] she will be one that fills the quiver
[1:12:01] that she could stand at the gate With
[1:12:03] the Enemy so we'll ask Alberta to pray
[1:12:06] as is accustomed for the baby and then
[1:12:09] we'll certainly pray all of us together

[1:15:07] worry about it and man let's open our
[1:15:08] barbers in Luke's chapter 2 the second
[1:15:10] chapter and we'll start from verse one
[1:15:15] foreign
[1:15:30] that they went out a degree from Caesar
[1:15:33] Augustus that that the whole world
[1:15:35] should be taxed
[1:15:37] and this testing was the first made by
[1:15:40] sirenius was when cyrenius was governor
[1:15:43] of Syria and all went to be taxed
[1:15:46] everyone in their own City and Joseph
[1:15:49] also went up From Galilee out of the
[1:15:52] city of Nazareth in Judea into the city
[1:15:55] of David which is called Bethlehem
[1:15:58] because he was of the House of the
[1:16:01] lineage of David to be taxed with Mary
[1:16:03] his spouse his spouse wife he's a spouse
[1:16:07] wife being with uh great with a child or
[1:16:11] child and so it was that while they were
[1:16:15] there the days were accomplished that
[1:16:18] they should be delivered and he brought
[1:16:21] forth his firstborn son and wrapped him
[1:16:24] in swaddling cloth and laid him in a
[1:16:27] Manger because there was no room
[1:16:31] for them in the end let's also turn to
[1:16:35] Matthew the second chapter
[1:16:38] and
[1:16:42] and let's start from verse one it says
[1:16:48] it says now when Jesus was born in
[1:16:50] Bethlehem of Judea
[1:16:52] in the days of Herod the king behold
[1:16:55] they came wise men
[1:16:57] from the East to Jerusalem saying where
[1:17:01] is he that is born King of the Jews
[1:17:03] for we have seen his star in the east
[1:17:07] and have come to worship him that's just
[1:17:10] by our heads our gracious father we ask

[1:17:49] gift of eternal life

[1:18:20] about and will most certainly go some to
[1:18:24] some quotes that brother random speaks
[1:18:25] and the things that is spoken and you
[1:18:28] you understand even in view of this
[1:18:30] message if I could say that this morning
[1:18:32] that it was really never about doctrines
[1:18:36] about teachings or about the things we
[1:18:39] know the things we don't know and how
[1:18:43] each one can explain the Bible and your
[1:18:46] Revelation how is it differs from mind
[1:18:48] and all of those things you really if
[1:18:52] you can sum it up the whole Gospel of
[1:18:54] Jesus Christ you'll realize that it was
[1:18:57] all about
[1:18:58] eternal life that was being given
[1:19:01] and I could say this morning many times
[1:19:03] as humans I feel like we forget that and
[1:19:07] and Paul will speak and said that if I
[1:19:10] speak with tongues of men and angels it
[1:19:12] said hey if I have uh if I have if I
[1:19:15] know all the Mysteries and I have all
[1:19:17] the knowledge and I could sit with you
[1:19:20] and expend the whole Bible and and show
[1:19:23] you great things but he said but if I
[1:19:25] lack charity I have nothing it says I'll
[1:19:28] be like a sounding symbol and just the
[1:19:31] noise that could be heard and why
[1:19:33] because he lacks the very substance of
[1:19:36] what the message was all about and the
[1:19:39] prophet would even tell us you know that
[1:19:41] many that this talk about even God it
[1:19:45] will say things like in the beginning
[1:19:48] God who was The God Who created the
[1:19:50] whole Heaven and Earth he said he had no
[1:19:52] ending or no beginning he covered all
[1:19:55] time in space but he would make a
[1:19:58] statement that always has stayed with me
[1:20:00] and will say that God was this great
[1:20:03] Fountain Of Love
[1:20:05] it would say God was this great Fountain
[1:20:08] of love and he would want us to
[1:20:10] understand that the motivation behind
[1:20:12] the entire creation was by love
[1:20:15] that it was God projecting his love and
[1:20:18] his creation so that everything that it
[1:20:20] was will be seen and you can even think
[1:20:23] I can even take it further and say this
[1:20:26] morning even the very Judgment of God is
[1:20:29] not so that it can hurt you or because
[1:20:31] he he didn't like you he wants to do you
[1:20:33] wrong but the very Judgment of God is
[1:20:36] based on that same Fountain of love it's
[1:20:39] because he wants to correct you he wants
[1:20:42] to bring you right back in the path he
[1:20:44] wants you to bring you back into the
[1:20:46] understanding that it's all about love
[1:20:48] you know people have even Twisted what
[1:20:50] love is all about and if they think it's
[1:20:53] giving flowers and doing this and all
[1:20:56] and all of that is good but the prophet
[1:20:58] will tell us that the very love of God
[1:21:01] is corrective love it would say that it
[1:21:04] will chastise you so he could bring you
[1:21:06] right back in the fold it's not because
[1:21:08] he hates you it's because he loves you
[1:21:11] and so I began to think we because you
[1:21:14] realize we live in the world where many
[1:21:17] people are interested in in having the
[1:21:20] power many people wants to do the works
[1:21:23] of God but how many are willing or
[1:21:25] wanting to do it by love you know that's
[1:21:28] why the prophet will tell us that power
[1:21:30] without character is satanic because why
[1:21:32] people wants to do great work they want
[1:21:35] to go and raise the dead and do all of
[1:21:37] that but they lack the very motive that
[1:21:39] they that God had in doing those things
[1:21:42] so in giving the power that he gave
[1:21:44] that's why he says in the scripture
[1:21:46] scriptures as many will come and say
[1:21:48] have we not done this and it will not
[1:21:50] done that he will look at them and say
[1:21:52] depart from me doers of iniquity I never
[1:21:56] knew you why because they didn't have
[1:21:58] the same heart that God did they didn't
[1:22:01] have the same desire that God did and I
[1:22:04] thought if I could perhaps change my
[1:22:06] title this morning I thought if we could
[1:22:08] have a conversion by love you know the
[1:22:12] people out there they're not looking for
[1:22:14] your theology or your knowledge or what
[1:22:16] you can explain or or you sit with him
[1:22:19] so they can see your Doctrine like
[1:22:20] you've seen it then they can believe no
[1:22:22] they want to see love come on display
[1:22:26] This Is The Life Of God was the life of
[1:22:30] love your fellow being a life that could
[1:22:33] go an extra mile a life that could look
[1:22:36] at somebody you don't have to come to my
[1:22:38] church you don't have to go to the same
[1:22:40] place I go you don't have to know who I
[1:22:42] am but the person who's only willing and
[1:22:45] Desiring to project the same love that
[1:22:48] God projected for them that's what the
[1:22:50] message is all about and and if we can
[1:22:53] only have that kind of heart that's the
[1:22:54] heart of God to have to understand that
[1:22:57] Christmas is about love the prophet will
[1:23:00] say this and will say uh even the many
[1:23:04] misunderstanding and the things that
[1:23:06] people have projected and we know we
[1:23:09] understand uh uh what what Chris is
[1:23:12] Christmas is all about and I'll read
[1:23:13] some quotes how the prophet is trying to
[1:23:15] bring it into the very perspective being
[1:23:19] in this season it will say in question
[1:23:21] answer I said I so appreciate all your
[1:23:24] prayers
[1:23:25] and by God's prayer God's help and Grace
[1:23:28] he says a very merry merry Christmas to
[1:23:32] every one of you it says remember my
[1:23:34] saying it's not Santa Claus this is for
[1:23:37] Jesus now and I want to say this the
[1:23:41] prophet is not trying to do away with
[1:23:43] the whole season but he's wanting you to
[1:23:45] understand the reason for the season
[1:23:47] because he's trying to bring it in
[1:23:50] perspective because if you're not
[1:23:51] careful you could take it too further oh
[1:23:53] we don't do this now I want to see you
[1:23:55] celebrating April or May I want to see
[1:23:58] you do something so there's got to come
[1:24:00] a time where this is brought back to
[1:24:02] remembrance so he's saying it's not
[1:24:05] about Santa Claus but it's for Jesus you
[1:24:07] see Christmas Means Christ and we were
[1:24:11] writing last night showing the kitties
[1:24:13] all the house decoration and everything
[1:24:15] which is an awful nice but I thought if
[1:24:19] I ever if anything on my house that I
[1:24:22] ever want to write it says would be on
[1:24:26] me on sign it says trusting Christ will
[1:24:30] be in your Christmas
[1:24:32] so he's wanting you to to to understand
[1:24:35] the the reason for the season and to put
[1:24:39] it right back in perspective and and not
[1:24:42] get lost into everything else that's
[1:24:44] happening and said bring bring
[1:24:46] entrusting that Christ is brought right
[1:24:48] back into Christmas he says that's right
[1:24:50] put Christ back into Christmas there's
[1:24:54] not nothing wrong with with you
[1:24:58] celebrating or having a good time but
[1:25:01] you have to understand the reason for
[1:25:04] the season
[1:25:06] he would say in the message sir we would
[1:25:08] see Jesus he says God bless you not
[1:25:11] exactly Merry Christmas but God's
[1:25:13] blessing of Christmas be upon you it
[1:25:17] says may the Christ of Calvary hide you
[1:25:20] in himself blanket you so write you and
[1:25:24] in uh enshroud you in his word till his
[1:25:28] word will be made flesh in you and so
[1:25:32] it's not all thank God for sending a
[1:25:34] baby send thank God for sending your son
[1:25:36] no that that's not good enough that's
[1:25:39] not the end of it the end of it is that
[1:25:41] son has to be in you that that son the
[1:25:45] promise has to be made flesh in you the
[1:25:47] son has to be manifested in your flesh
[1:25:50] and he says in your flesh is my prayer
[1:25:53] God bless you and I'm going in a little
[1:25:55] fast for the sake of time as I said I
[1:25:57] don't want to be too long uh in the
[1:25:59] message we have seen it start and come
[1:26:01] to worship Him it says I wish you the
[1:26:03] very merriest of Christmas that God will
[1:26:06] send his star from the East thy Rose in
[1:26:10] the East to 19 years ago and they will
[1:26:13] guide you through the word made flesh
[1:26:16] the purpose for this story is always to
[1:26:19] guide the purpose for the son is always
[1:26:21] to send you somewhere and it's to send
[1:26:24] you back to his word back to the
[1:26:26] understanding of the hour back to what
[1:26:29] he's trying to achieve in that season
[1:26:30] back to what the the reason why the son
[1:26:34] was given he's trying to ring it right
[1:26:36] back into perspective and now in the
[1:26:39] message presuming it says now this is a
[1:26:42] little bit longer or just just be
[1:26:44] patient with me as I'm laying the
[1:26:46] foundation it says now we have just
[1:26:48] passed two of the major holidays and he
[1:26:51] preached this in January so he's
[1:26:53] referring to the holiday that just
[1:26:55] passed it says and we know
[1:26:58] we know here in America to be Christmas
[1:27:01] time and New Year's it's actually not
[1:27:03] Christmas it says it's not it's not a
[1:27:07] Christmas it's a day that we set aside
[1:27:10] course we realize it is in the it isn't
[1:27:13] the Lord's birthday he couldn't have
[1:27:15] been born in December 25th because it's
[1:27:17] cold up there Shepherd could not have
[1:27:20] been on the hills and so forth it says
[1:27:22] it was uh if if you ever was in Judea
[1:27:27] along that time it says of the year you
[1:27:30] could see it wasn't it wasn't in the
[1:27:32] winter time but it start perhaps along
[1:27:35] in April or May when limbs are born and
[1:27:39] he says and like he came by all nature
[1:27:41] just like irregular Lambs are born he
[1:27:45] was born he says he was the Lamb of God
[1:27:48] and he was born along that time so now
[1:27:52] he's showing you this is not the real
[1:27:54] dates we understand that this is not a
[1:27:57] season for it he couldn't been in
[1:27:59] December and all of that and we
[1:28:01] understand where all of that came from
[1:28:03] the Roman Calendar and all those things
[1:28:05] but here's what I'm trying to get to the
[1:28:08] message that he's trying to give us he
[1:28:10] says but it start like a regular Olympia
[1:28:13] was the Lamb of God along that time but
[1:28:15] I it says but I don't suppose that he
[1:28:18] cares what day we set aside
[1:28:22] he says but I don't suppose he cares
[1:28:24] what date was set aside because it's the
[1:28:27] the actual day is lost it is it says it
[1:28:31] is in commemoration of his birthday so
[1:28:34] he's wanting us to look at this in
[1:28:37] commemoration of his birthday because we
[1:28:39] don't know what the actual day was it
[1:28:41] says instead of making it a
[1:28:44] commemoration of a day of worship to God
[1:28:47] for he fulfill him sending his son to us
[1:28:50] we we have celebrations we we we
[1:28:53] celebrate Christmas it's not a
[1:28:56] celebration we couldn't celebrate
[1:28:58] Washington's birthday or Lincoln's
[1:29:00] birthday or some other greats Mane's
[1:29:02] birthday you might celebrate it but
[1:29:05] Christ but Christmas should be a day of
[1:29:09] worship right now oh my it's not a day
[1:29:13] where we just oh you know a gift's
[1:29:15] exchange buy this and do this he's
[1:29:17] wanting to know it's the day of worship
[1:29:19] he says we have Twisted it around and
[1:29:22] creative
[1:29:23] another great commercial day it's all
[1:29:27] fixed up in past uh passing presence to
[1:29:30] one another and having feelings hurt if
[1:29:32] we don't do it
[1:29:34] you forgot to get me a gift oh my
[1:29:36] goodness I said you know it's going to
[1:29:38] take a year to fix it you know it it it
[1:29:42] you know here we are the prophet is he's
[1:29:45] showing us what the world has done with
[1:29:48] it they have forgotten this is about
[1:29:50] eternal life that was given they are
[1:29:52] focused on just gifts exchange and and
[1:29:55] all those things it says we've Twisted
[1:29:57] all up completely we've we've taken it
[1:29:59] and commercializing it in everything now
[1:30:02] and I want to say this because I thought
[1:30:04] this was so important and yet we are
[1:30:07] people uh are going through and for and
[1:30:11] and buying things and this is the great
[1:30:13] commercial time that there is and people
[1:30:15] are forgetting the reason for the season
[1:30:17] now I was looking at this and I thought
[1:30:20] perhaps you will bring into perspective
[1:30:23] what's really happening out there you
[1:30:25] know they're saying that Christmas and
[1:30:27] this is an article I came across it
[1:30:30] speaks about Christmas it says Christmas
[1:30:32] is typically the large just economic
[1:30:36] stimulant for Many Nations around the
[1:30:39] world it says and the cells increased
[1:30:42] drastically in almost all retails area
[1:30:44] during this time so in 2022 the total
[1:30:49] holiday retail sales were projected were
[1:30:52] projected to reach a height of
[1:30:56] 942 billion US dollars
[1:31:00] I'm sure you acquainted with what they
[1:31:03] referred to as stimulus so something
[1:31:05] that brings the very economy is based on
[1:31:08] borrowing an interest and and consuming
[1:31:11] and all of those things so so if you
[1:31:14] take out all the holidays you take
[1:31:15] everything combined the the year end is
[1:31:19] the biggest time that the U.S economy or
[1:31:22] all the economies of the world are
[1:31:24] relying on in order to move on so
[1:31:26] without the celebration or without this
[1:31:28] uh gift-giving and all those things the
[1:31:31] one there won't be any economy because
[1:31:33] it's 942 billion and and and the economy
[1:31:37] relies on it you know people spend money
[1:31:40] they don't have and well either we work
[1:31:43] and we work and then we come towards the
[1:31:46] end of the year we spend everything that
[1:31:48] we have and January comes we go back to
[1:31:50] work we're stuck in this cycle where we
[1:31:52] save up everything and if we don't thank
[1:31:54] God for credit card we can we pawn it on
[1:31:57] and pay later and do all those things so
[1:31:59] that's the reason for the season that
[1:32:01] people have taken it that's what they're
[1:32:04] constantly getting stuck on that's what
[1:32:06] they do and the property is here to
[1:32:08] remind us that's not the reason you know
[1:32:10] as Believers we have to constantly be
[1:32:13] reminded because it's easy to get caught
[1:32:15] up or we didn't get a gift for this one
[1:32:17] we forgot to do this and we forgot to do
[1:32:19] this and oh we didn't get kids enough
[1:32:22] gift and they need two each and they
[1:32:24] need three each and oh this is the the
[1:32:26] list from so and so this is what you got
[1:32:28] to do and if you forget you forget what
[1:32:31] the season is all about
[1:32:33] and the prophet is wanting us to be
[1:32:35] reminded it's not about what you can buy
[1:32:38] and what you can do all those things
[1:32:40] will perish you're not the first one to
[1:32:43] do it right now now he's speaking about
[1:32:45] these things and what year is this is
[1:32:47] speaking in 1962 he's realizing what has
[1:32:51] been done and and the economy and all
[1:32:53] those things and now is reminding the
[1:32:55] believer when it comes time to the
[1:32:57] season you put everything in perspective
[1:33:00] if you don't have money to spend don't
[1:33:02] spend it people get stressed out and
[1:33:04] because they want to do things and they
[1:33:06] want to please everybody the prophet is
[1:33:08] here to remind you he says Christmas is
[1:33:11] about Christ
[1:33:12] stay with it
[1:33:14] so the projection for 2020 it was about
[1:33:18] 852 billion 2021 it was about 886
[1:33:23] billion and 2022 is projected to be a uh
[1:33:28] between
[1:33:29] 932 to
[1:33:31] 942 billion dollars span during the
[1:33:34] season you think about Thanksgiving you
[1:33:37] think about uh uh uh Christmas you think
[1:33:40] about New Year's so it's all combined
[1:33:42] together that's why I was joking the
[1:33:44] editor I said Christmas is right the
[1:33:46] date right after Thanksgiving why
[1:33:48] because the season continues it's time
[1:33:51] you know 50 off and 50 percent off fifty
[1:33:54] percent of uh of a thousand is still a
[1:33:57] lot of money so they they come and they
[1:33:59] they up the price and it puts the wrong
[1:34:02] stickers on and they dropped the price
[1:34:04] and it's all commercialization it's all
[1:34:07] trying to get the money out of your
[1:34:08] pocket not the prophet is sending us put
[1:34:11] it right back in perspective put it
[1:34:14] right back to what it's supposed to be
[1:34:15] this is the time where the greatest gift
[1:34:18] on Earth and God came and oh my if this
[1:34:22] morning you can come and realize that I
[1:34:25] I was born a sinner I was lost and I
[1:34:28] didn't I couldn't find my way and even
[1:34:31] as the scripture says it says oh Kenny
[1:34:34] Ethiopian changes Canal can a leopard
[1:34:37] remove his Mark you couldn't do it you
[1:34:39] were stuck in sin it was condemnation by
[1:34:42] representation it was the way you came
[1:34:45] and you couldn't have done nothing about
[1:34:47] it but oh God wrapped themselves into a
[1:34:51] gift and and he came and he gave you the
[1:34:53] gift of eternal life and I want to say
[1:34:56] that that has to be the identification
[1:34:58] of every new born-again believer it's
[1:35:01] the understanding of coming into the
[1:35:03] realization that I was lost and I I
[1:35:07] didn't save myself and if I am what I am
[1:35:10] is by the grace of God he opened my eyes
[1:35:13] to see that someone died for me he
[1:35:16] opened my eyes so I can accept his word
[1:35:18] and by accepting this word he became to
[1:35:21] make he started making the changes in my
[1:35:24] life he took this out he took that out
[1:35:27] he made his word a reality in my life
[1:35:34] so he wants us not to forget what the
[1:35:37] season is all about he wants us to
[1:35:40] understand that it was about a life that
[1:35:43] was given and the prophet will say now
[1:35:46] it says and now but in this hour of
[1:35:50] Darkness I say I say that we that we are
[1:35:54] living He says still Christmas should be
[1:35:57] holding forth that light
[1:36:00] I I read it wrong let me read it again
[1:36:03] and it says now in the hour of this
[1:36:05] Darkness as we say we it says that we
[1:36:09] are living in a still Christians should
[1:36:11] be holding forth that light
[1:36:14] that there is still there is a true
[1:36:18] truth to Christmas
[1:36:21] he doesn't want you to say well you know
[1:36:24] Christ was not born in December and and
[1:36:27] I won't do anything and I want uh I'm
[1:36:30] not going to do anything I'm just going
[1:36:31] to say he wants you to be remembered
[1:36:33] that there has to be a truth for
[1:36:36] Christmas if this is the time that has
[1:36:38] been chosen that people are celebrating
[1:36:40] your your work or your job is to go to
[1:36:44] those people when you meet them to tell
[1:36:46] them what the true Christmas is all
[1:36:48] about to remind them it's not about
[1:36:50] buying exchanging gifts it's about a
[1:36:52] life that has been given and what God is
[1:36:55] looking out of you is to receive that
[1:36:57] light so you may be saved
[1:37:02] but what I'm going to say in the message
[1:37:03] the seal and we know this in the Easter
[1:37:06] seal you know this very well it says I I
[1:37:09] wonder today if you if if it happened
[1:37:13] what happening as we we're really
[1:37:15] getting people to God or are we just
[1:37:17] trying to get them to church
[1:37:20] because and I remember this is not just
[1:37:22] oh it's Christmas Day come to church
[1:37:24] many people that have never that spent
[1:37:28] the whole year they don't go to church
[1:37:29] today they're probably in temples and
[1:37:32] churches and everywhere why because it's
[1:37:34] Christmas Day
[1:37:36] but through Christmas is not just to
[1:37:39] come to a once in a time in the building
[1:37:41] and come and show your appreciation and
[1:37:43] walk away but through Christmas is to be
[1:37:46] born again and have the life living
[1:37:48] inside of you having that life directing
[1:37:51] your life every day having a life
[1:37:54] leading you every single time
[1:37:58] he says we must give them to Christ he
[1:38:02] said we're the quickening power is he
[1:38:04] says it's good to go to church sure it
[1:38:08] says but if that's as far as it goes
[1:38:11] it's not far enough it says when you
[1:38:13] come to church it's good but go on to
[1:38:17] Christ it says from the church because
[1:38:20] we must receive this quickening power
[1:38:23] and if we ever receive if we're ever
[1:38:26] going to receive that that General if
[1:38:29] we're going to accept that to be in that
[1:38:32] if we're going to expect to be in that
[1:38:34] General Resurrection he says because
[1:38:36] it's the only thing that will ever bring
[1:38:38] us back
[1:38:41] to come in contact with Christ himself
[1:38:44] oh my many people will read the Bible
[1:38:48] today many will stand up before and they
[1:38:51] will have services and they will help
[1:38:52] people come and and and offer their
[1:38:55] offerings and they will do all of those
[1:38:57] things and but yet it's just an empty
[1:38:59] ceremony the very purpose why the day
[1:39:04] was given the very purpose why Christ
[1:39:06] came is a very lost in them they don't
[1:39:09] understand that it's all about a life
[1:39:11] that was given a life a life that was
[1:39:14] sent and what was that life sent for
[1:39:16] that life was sinned so it could take
[1:39:19] you that was a bonus Sinner and return
[1:39:22] you into what you were supposed to be in
[1:39:25] the mind of God in the beginning this
[1:39:28] life was the only way of escape from
[1:39:31] this best house that we are in this life
[1:39:34] was saying so he can take you and give
[1:39:36] you the power to overcome the daily
[1:39:39] things that bothers you to overcome the
[1:39:42] sin that bothers you to overcome the
[1:39:45] Temptation that comes at you and there's
[1:39:47] no other form of life except this life
[1:39:50] and that's why we need to be born again
[1:39:53] as Sons and Daughters of God to receive
[1:39:55] the spirit of Christ within us because
[1:39:58] it's the only thing that will overcome
[1:40:00] because because he says if I live you
[1:40:02] shall live also to miss that life is to
[1:40:06] miss the power to overcome everything
[1:40:12] the prophet will say the scripture will
[1:40:14] say the prophet will say it says I think
[1:40:18] what's what it says that's what's matter
[1:40:21] with with the church with the churches
[1:40:24] brother he says when he gets to the
[1:40:27] place that we put our church first
[1:40:30] instead of Christ
[1:40:33] meaning your Your Allegiance
[1:40:36] your your your obligation is just oh if
[1:40:40] I don't go they won't see they'll see
[1:40:42] that I was missing I know or you know
[1:40:44] I'll come and you know just so people
[1:40:46] can see that I'm a Christian it says if
[1:40:48] you put your church first it says
[1:40:50] instead of Christ it says we are going
[1:40:53] right straight down
[1:40:57] when we put them as individuals we put
[1:41:01] your church first your social life first
[1:41:04] instead of your spiritual life you are
[1:41:08] going to fail
[1:41:11] oh my I I I I I believe there's no plain
[1:41:14] words you can put that this morning is
[1:41:17] here trying to let you know you that I I
[1:41:20] called yourself Christians you that have
[1:41:22] received this uh child or this this uh a
[1:41:26] new birth and you that have received
[1:41:28] this gift that God had given that if you
[1:41:31] live your life and your priority is not
[1:41:34] this life you are surely going to fail
[1:41:37] and and he didn't say well if you do a
[1:41:41] little bit and then you add something
[1:41:42] else no he's saying if your priority is
[1:41:45] not this life you surely going to fail
[1:41:47] if your job is first if your family is
[1:41:51] first if your career is first if
[1:41:53] whatever you do is first the moment you
[1:41:55] put that first you are surely going to
[1:41:57] fail the prophet says
[1:42:00] oh my why because I want to say this let
[1:42:03] me just jump and I'll just get towards
[1:42:05] the end because everything that you have
[1:42:07] need of is in this gift
[1:42:11] this gift was sent to you to provide for
[1:42:14] you both naturally and spiritually this
[1:42:18] gift was not sent so you can just say
[1:42:20] well he saved me spiritually but on the
[1:42:23] natural I gotta have to do my best and
[1:42:25] do no this gift was provided so you can
[1:42:28] have everything that you have need of
[1:42:30] this gift was given so he can take you
[1:42:32] from birth into the body change
[1:42:37] oh my oftentimes we neglect this gift
[1:42:40] and we go after things that don't have
[1:42:42] life we go after things that are only
[1:42:46] provide a temporary uh relief or a
[1:42:49] temporary excitement and after that we
[1:42:52] come back and and the reason why we are
[1:42:54] up and down all the time is because we
[1:42:56] neglect this life but if you can get
[1:42:58] this life and let they lead you it will
[1:43:01] take you to the destination why because
[1:43:03] he did it with Christ he will do it with
[1:43:06] you
[1:43:07] thank you
[1:43:09] that scripture was picked in John
[1:43:11] chapter 1 and verse 4 it says in him was
[1:43:14] life
[1:43:15] and life was the light of men this life
[1:43:20] was supposed to be your Guiding Light it
[1:43:22] was what supposed to direct your path to
[1:43:25] tell you where you should go what you
[1:43:27] should be doing it's a light that's
[1:43:30] supposed to Lead You In places it's a
[1:43:32] light that's supposed to govern your
[1:43:34] life it's the light that's supposed to
[1:43:36] lead you from here all the way to
[1:43:39] Eternity
[1:43:41] but when I will say
[1:43:44] he says in just a little while
[1:43:47] from then on the world was going to
[1:43:49] receive its greatest gift that he ever
[1:43:52] received
[1:43:53] and the Lord says a little package
[1:43:56] wrapped up a little
[1:43:59] first it says first the the first little
[1:44:02] Christmas package that was ever wrapped
[1:44:05] in the world
[1:44:07] God wrapped it up
[1:44:11] think about all the gifting and all the
[1:44:14] things that you do the first gift that
[1:44:16] ever was wrapped God himself wrapped it
[1:44:19] and here's what he says and I want to
[1:44:21] break into my thoughts and say this he
[1:44:24] says the greatest thing that ever
[1:44:27] wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it
[1:44:32] God himself
[1:44:34] wrapped his own self
[1:44:37] in a Christmas package and send it to
[1:44:41] the world my brother my sister there's
[1:44:44] nothing greater in the world and that's
[1:44:46] what the prophet is talking about
[1:44:47] there's nothing if you can understand it
[1:44:50] this morning he took his own life he
[1:44:52] didn't send the son that was separate
[1:44:54] from him but the son was the creation of
[1:44:57] the Father the Son was the father
[1:45:00] changing forms because in the form that
[1:45:03] he was of God God cannot die but there
[1:45:06] had to be a deity that was given in
[1:45:09] service for death he takes his own life
[1:45:12] and he wraps it together and he puts it
[1:45:14] in a human flesh and but when I will say
[1:45:17] that flesh will take that deity within
[1:45:19] it and will walk on earth and it
[1:45:22] suffered like you suffering he knew it
[1:45:24] was tempted by all things that you
[1:45:26] attempted that life came and he came in
[1:45:29] contact with the devil but all he
[1:45:31] overcame for you so that you don't have
[1:45:35] to go through the same thing
[1:45:39] this is not a life that was given now we
[1:45:41] can just come and say oh praise God that
[1:45:44] was just God and and he was in The Godly
[1:45:46] body and he did all of that by God no he
[1:45:49] came he took your place so you can take
[1:45:52] his place he tasted sin so you don't
[1:45:55] have to go the way you were going he
[1:45:58] took your life so you can take his life
[1:46:02] oh my if that could ever sink just in
[1:46:05] our mind and I want to say this he
[1:46:07] didn't have to die
[1:46:09] you have to understand this he did not
[1:46:11] have to die God could have wiped out the
[1:46:14] whole world and created a new seed and
[1:46:18] created a new generation but oh he was
[1:46:20] this great Fountain Of Love
[1:46:23] and the prophet said that God he didn't
[1:46:25] want to be defeated these were seeds
[1:46:29] that he created this were created in His
[1:46:31] image it was created by his word and
[1:46:35] this word can never be defeated so God
[1:46:38] wrapped himself into his own word he
[1:46:41] came down so you might have life this
[1:46:44] morning
[1:46:46] don't ever forget it don't ever forget
[1:46:49] that
[1:46:50] Oh my he says this in the message uh God
[1:46:54] perfecting his church I'll just jump
[1:46:57] quickly he says he says he says now uh
[1:47:00] he says now God himself came down in a
[1:47:04] blood cell
[1:47:06] and wrapped the blood around him he says
[1:47:10] the blood cell The Germ of Life Of God
[1:47:13] himself wrapped into the blood cell and
[1:47:16] brought forth a son Christ Jesus it says
[1:47:20] now he did he he doesn't buy he says
[1:47:24] that makes you perfect and brings you
[1:47:27] back into Fellowship
[1:47:30] now this is the first purpose he says he
[1:47:34] brings you through that blood cell into
[1:47:37] himself you get it he says through the
[1:47:40] blood cell of the Lord Jesus you are you
[1:47:44] you are that that invailed that in
[1:47:48] veiled that life the life of Jehovah and
[1:47:51] we coming through the blood cell comes a
[1:47:55] part of that life so deity itself
[1:47:59] lays in the man that received the Holy
[1:48:03] Ghost so when we when we speak about
[1:48:06] this life this is not
[1:48:09] says there's only one form of eternal
[1:48:12] life so God cannot send a life in Jesus
[1:48:15] Christ and give you a different life
[1:48:17] from the life that was in him he says
[1:48:19] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:48:21] and if you ever had eternal life you
[1:48:24] cannot lose it so this was the seed of
[1:48:26] God that would never come into fruition
[1:48:28] so God sends his own son to come and die
[1:48:31] for the sins and everything and through
[1:48:34] the Holy Ghost God can come and Quicken
[1:48:36] our life and bring you up so you can
[1:48:39] have the same life that he had
[1:48:43] he says you are a son
[1:48:46] I'm a brain and by birth and the part of
[1:48:49] Miss and Mrs Branham is in me
[1:48:52] if you become a son or a daughter of God
[1:48:56] part of part of deity
[1:49:00] raising you
[1:49:04] but look at us
[1:49:07] do we really understand that
[1:49:10] we really live by it
[1:49:13] oftentimes something strike a moral
[1:49:15] thoughts are the first to take over
[1:49:18] our moral thoughts are the first what am
[1:49:20] I going to do woe is me how am I going
[1:49:23] to get out of this and blah and this and
[1:49:25] this and this here is the gospel
[1:49:27] reminding you part of God is in you he
[1:49:30] gave it to you so you can overcome the
[1:49:33] world
[1:49:34] but when I will say in paragraph 38 of
[1:49:37] deity of Jesus Christ it says one of the
[1:49:40] greatest gifts that God ever gives the
[1:49:42] world was Jesus
[1:49:45] he says we know that
[1:49:47] and now I want to speak this morning
[1:49:50] upon the deity of Jesus of the D of upon
[1:49:53] his deity who he is so many has him as a
[1:49:58] little baby laying out there in the
[1:50:00] cradle and so forth it says but that was
[1:50:04] just a that was just one of the picture
[1:50:06] it says just one of the settings forth
[1:50:09] of the drama to bring it up to what he
[1:50:12] really is his deity
[1:50:16] why is he saying
[1:50:18] so you understand you are deity
[1:50:21] if his deity you are deity if his deity
[1:50:25] he dwells in you you become deity you
[1:50:28] become even as part of himself as he was
[1:50:33] paragraph 62 it says notice then that
[1:50:36] blood came down and was it was Christ
[1:50:40] Jesus and God himself I love this and
[1:50:44] God himself coming out of spirit went
[1:50:49] into Christ Jesus
[1:50:53] God coming out of spirit he was the
[1:50:56] spirit that covered all time in his face
[1:50:57] he came out of the spirit and came into
[1:50:59] Christ Jesus and the Bible says God was
[1:51:02] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:51:04] himself is that right God himself
[1:51:06] Jehovah lived in Christ and was made
[1:51:09] Kingsman to us because he was born in
[1:51:12] human flesh like we are is that right he
[1:51:15] says that the blood cells were developed
[1:51:18] by God the flesh the cells were
[1:51:21] developed in the womb of Mary that
[1:51:23] brought forth the child and God came
[1:51:27] down and live in human flesh and was
[1:51:30] tempted in every manner just like you
[1:51:33] are
[1:51:33] do you believe that is that right it
[1:51:36] says now then when he did that he freely
[1:51:40] gave his blood he didn't have it to do
[1:51:44] it he made that sacrifice he could have
[1:51:48] went right up into Glory he he says he
[1:51:52] could have he could have been
[1:51:53] transfigured like it was on the Mount of
[1:51:56] transfiguration went into heaven and
[1:51:59] never died for us but he says to be
[1:52:03] willing to die for us he gave freely his
[1:52:07] blood at Calvary that's right
[1:52:10] he picked up he picked out he was made
[1:52:13] he was a man of sorrow acquainted with
[1:52:16] grief
[1:52:17] and made a public testimony
[1:52:21] why
[1:52:23] so you can have that life this morning
[1:52:26] so we would walk and have his life
[1:52:29] that life live in us so we could stand
[1:52:32] here and say that the works that I did
[1:52:34] you shall do also why because the same
[1:52:38] life that was in Christ being us and I
[1:52:41] want to say this I think some of the
[1:52:42] reason is because we don't hunger for it
[1:52:44] enough
[1:52:45] we don't hunger to see the works that
[1:52:48] Christ did being done in us we okay with
[1:52:51] the superficial you know I come and I
[1:52:53] just come and I listen and I hear what
[1:52:56] God is wanting us and I try to do my
[1:52:58] best and I said no God wants us to give
[1:53:00] all he gave all so you can give all and
[1:53:04] the only reason you can get into that
[1:53:06] fullness is if you give all of you
[1:53:08] because as long as there's a part of you
[1:53:10] that's holding back you cannot come into
[1:53:12] the fullness
[1:53:14] now just moving on now here we are and
[1:53:18] and as we read in Luke Chapter 2 it
[1:53:20] talks about the taxation by the emperor
[1:53:22] Caesar Augustus and and he came and and
[1:53:25] the prophet will use this and he talks
[1:53:27] about it was a time for taxation so
[1:53:30] everyone had to go back to their own
[1:53:33] City where they were born into their own
[1:53:35] place and you will talk about how you
[1:53:38] you think about how all of this and it
[1:53:41] says think about all of the the ones
[1:53:43] that were sick and all of the ones uh
[1:53:45] perhaps had a a uh uh all kinds of
[1:53:49] illnesses or couldn't walk and all those
[1:53:52] things everybody had to go back to the
[1:53:54] respective place
[1:53:56] he says remember and think about how
[1:53:59] many could have cursed the king or the
[1:54:01] emperor because of that and pray and say
[1:54:03] you know that that God May reverse the
[1:54:06] decision
[1:54:07] but he said
[1:54:09] but all of that was done so that the
[1:54:11] prophecy may be fulfilled
[1:54:14] he says you think about their nightmares
[1:54:17] and all the things that were happening
[1:54:19] you you look at it and looking at it
[1:54:22] from the natural eye it just seems like
[1:54:24] oh I can't believe this this is what we
[1:54:26] have to do now and you know you think
[1:54:28] about all the stuff that happened you
[1:54:30] think about inflation and all to the
[1:54:33] human eyes it just looks like natural
[1:54:35] well I can't believe the cycles of
[1:54:37] economy now we have to pay higher
[1:54:39] inflation and and the historians will
[1:54:41] come and bring you a statistics inside
[1:54:43] and in 19 and so and so this happened
[1:54:46] also and the inflation rate when up to
[1:54:50] this percent and now it's their sin so
[1:54:52] it's the cycle of the economy and they
[1:54:54] go back and they said what did we do to
[1:54:56] bring it down and they do and all of
[1:54:59] that is looking at it through the human
[1:55:01] eyes but those that knew what the
[1:55:03] scripture says they understood the
[1:55:06] reason why the king made the decree
[1:55:08] those that understood the reason why
[1:55:11] they understood that the prophecy those
[1:55:13] that knew the prophecy knew that son was
[1:55:15] to be born in Bethlehem and I want to
[1:55:17] say this morning God will move Kings God
[1:55:21] will move presidents God will move
[1:55:23] Governors God will move you to fulfill
[1:55:26] his word there is nothing that can stop
[1:55:29] the word of God God is able to create
[1:55:32] something new out of nothing so when the
[1:55:35] time comes for his word to be fulfilled
[1:55:37] he will move whatever needs to be moved
[1:55:42] and I want to just say that because
[1:55:44] often time we hear and and we look at
[1:55:48] the burdens of life and all those things
[1:55:50] and say how can me with this condition
[1:55:53] that I am in every day how can I obtain
[1:55:55] the the the the the the Rapture or the
[1:55:58] body change God will bring forth the
[1:56:01] battery the body change when it's time
[1:56:03] for the body change to come you continue
[1:56:05] in his word you continue to do what he
[1:56:08] told you to do it's for him to bring it
[1:56:10] to pass
[1:56:11] in that word we let's not concentrate on
[1:56:15] things that we don't have business doing
[1:56:17] let's do the things that we are called
[1:56:19] to do the scripture says that all things
[1:56:22] work together for them not love him so
[1:56:25] your job is to love him
[1:56:27] your job is to praise him your job is to
[1:56:31] thank him for all that comes to you your
[1:56:33] job is to rejoice in whatever condition
[1:56:35] you'll find and it's God's job to take
[1:56:38] the negative and the positive and work
[1:56:40] it all together for good
[1:56:45] you you you it would say oh look at them
[1:56:48] that little mother and you always about
[1:56:51] to expecting and you put him on a little
[1:56:53] donkey in and have him go so many miles
[1:56:56] it was so uncomfortable but it was a
[1:56:59] promise it was for a purpose for the
[1:57:01] prophecy to be fulfilled and barabbana
[1:57:04] will say this he will say this it says
[1:57:06] it says now
[1:57:09] in this last day
[1:57:11] in these last days there was a great
[1:57:14] persecution against the church Caesar
[1:57:16] Augustus had made a great plan that it
[1:57:19] would tax all the people and that was
[1:57:20] the only that was only to be done for
[1:57:22] one purpose listen now he says that the
[1:57:25] God's Great prophecy will be fulfilled
[1:57:28] now listen to this
[1:57:31] only thing you have to do
[1:57:34] when you see something in the Bible that
[1:57:37] sounds just a little Mystic
[1:57:39] and a little suspicious superficials
[1:57:44] super superstitious to you just give God
[1:57:48] a little bit of time
[1:57:51] I love this
[1:57:53] I love this I Pray oh God give us
[1:57:56] patience to give you time you know we go
[1:57:59] through difficult things and and each
[1:58:01] one can come here you know we can talk
[1:58:04] about the things that you're facing and
[1:58:06] I know each Believers has a battle that
[1:58:08] they're fighting and I know that for a
[1:58:10] fact if you don't have a paddle you need
[1:58:13] to check yourself
[1:58:14] but I want to say this each one we go
[1:58:17] through things and we have things that
[1:58:19] we have before the Lord that we don't
[1:58:21] understand why and we pray day and night
[1:58:24] and God knows it because those things
[1:58:26] are constantly on our minds
[1:58:29] and God will allow it
[1:58:31] and yeah this Prophet said give God a
[1:58:34] little bit of time it says God is in no
[1:58:37] hurry we are the ones that gets in a
[1:58:40] hurry just give God a little bit of time
[1:58:43] and you will see those old prophetic
[1:58:46] Wills cogs run up into the picture we're
[1:58:51] not the one developing the picture we're
[1:58:53] only part of the story God has the whole
[1:58:56] picture God knows exactly what to teach
[1:58:59] you so he can bring the the sound that
[1:59:01] he's looking for and God knows exactly
[1:59:04] in what condition to put you so some
[1:59:07] words can come out of your mouth and
[1:59:09] perhaps those words will bless somebody
[1:59:10] or will do something to somebody but
[1:59:13] he's saying that you just give God time
[1:59:15] and watch what he's doing it says he's
[1:59:18] the one that developed we he will run up
[1:59:21] into the picture it will develop just
[1:59:24] like like just like the bringing up of a
[1:59:27] picture
[1:59:29] I want to say this if we can this
[1:59:32] morning understand it's God who has the
[1:59:35] picture it's God who's developing the
[1:59:37] picture whatever is happening to you
[1:59:40] whether good or bad you just keep it in
[1:59:42] God's hands you just continue to show it
[1:59:45] to God God knows when the time is for
[1:59:48] him to come and save you God knows what
[1:59:50] time is it so he can come and perhaps
[1:59:53] take you out of that situation why he's
[1:59:55] waiting for his time
[1:59:57] oftentimes we want God to operate on our
[2:00:00] time
[2:00:01] you know I was thinking about you think
[2:00:04] about
[2:00:05] Lazarus being dead
[2:00:07] I've always thought that's the greatest
[2:00:10] understanding of what God's time means
[2:00:13] you think about what happened yeah they
[2:00:16] are and they they're calling upon him
[2:00:18] please come please come please come and
[2:00:21] and he hears that Lazarus is sick and he
[2:00:24] delays because why he had a vision but
[2:00:27] they didn't understand the picture they
[2:00:29] didn't have the full picture they didn't
[2:00:31] know what God was about to do all they
[2:00:34] were looking for they knew is they
[2:00:35] needed Deliverance they needed someone
[2:00:37] to come and save them and he waits and
[2:00:39] Lazarus died
[2:00:41] and perhaps within their hearts I could
[2:00:43] have said well you know I've seen him
[2:00:45] heal the sick perhaps if he comes when
[2:00:48] he's sick it can heal him and then he
[2:00:50] died and perhaps within the mind they
[2:00:51] said well I seen him raise the dead or
[2:00:54] if he can come just now as he's still
[2:00:57] dead perhaps he can raise him but Jesus
[2:01:01] delays until the Decay but when I'm says
[2:01:04] the news sunk and he says corruption
[2:01:07] began to take his place
[2:01:09] and at that time they had no physical
[2:01:12] evidence of anything that is done that
[2:01:15] they could point to and say he could
[2:01:16] still rise no wonder he says oh if he
[2:01:20] will only come
[2:01:21] if you had only been here in time my
[2:01:25] brother would have not died
[2:01:27] and Jesus looked at him and says I am
[2:01:29] the resurrection and the life and Martha
[2:01:32] looks and says yes I know but I know my
[2:01:34] brother will rise in the last day and
[2:01:37] all those things he looks at him and
[2:01:38] says no he that is speaking to you right
[2:01:41] now I am the resurrection and life oh
[2:01:45] Mount of Faith got brought from the
[2:01:47] future into the present she said even
[2:01:49] now I believe that whatever you say God
[2:01:52] will honor it what is it you do she
[2:01:54] opened the door for eternity to be
[2:01:57] manifested and Jesus stood there and he
[2:02:00] says Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came
[2:02:03] out what was it that was God's time
[2:02:06] your time may have passed you can look
[2:02:09] at your time and say my time has passed
[2:02:11] and there's no way I could have a baby
[2:02:13] there's no way this could happen there's
[2:02:15] no way that I can do that's your time
[2:02:17] how about God's time this morning if you
[2:02:20] can only invite God's time you can say
[2:02:23] I'm sick I don't know what to do the
[2:02:25] doctor says this condition will stay
[2:02:27] upon me forever that's the doctor's time
[2:02:30] how about God's time what we need is to
[2:02:33] invite him so he can come and and take
[2:02:36] us from our time and bring us into his
[2:02:39] time
[2:02:41] his time is eternity
[2:02:44] his time is the present
[2:02:46] he says I am the resurrection and the
[2:02:50] life
[2:02:51] the prophet will speak
[2:02:53] he will say you think about Mary yeah
[2:02:56] they are and
[2:02:58] he will talk about how he dramatized it
[2:03:00] and they're coming and
[2:03:02] and they go up and and they go up and
[2:03:05] and all those things and he says
[2:03:09] they will come in in all the situation
[2:03:12] it will think how cruel this King was
[2:03:14] even them they didn't understand the
[2:03:16] very purpose they just do well the
[2:03:19] decree is done and we're going to go and
[2:03:20] and everything and that's all we're just
[2:03:22] going to go and register it says many
[2:03:25] times we look at the scripture in our
[2:03:28] own way of looking
[2:03:31] how many has done it
[2:03:34] every day
[2:03:35] we look at it it says one thing it says
[2:03:38] one thing and and we look at it and all
[2:03:40] of a sudden something else began to rise
[2:03:43] like I never saw it this way it says he
[2:03:46] seems very hard
[2:03:48] but if we study a little while
[2:03:51] we found out that the all
[2:03:54] all-wise God
[2:03:56] knows just what he's doing
[2:04:00] is the all-wisdom god he knows what he's
[2:04:03] doing it says and he knows how to do
[2:04:06] these things and knows how to deal with
[2:04:09] man
[2:04:10] he knows your pinpoint
[2:04:13] he knows what he could come he could get
[2:04:15] you screaming right now he knows exactly
[2:04:18] where he needs to touch he can get you
[2:04:20] to jump and happy he knows where to
[2:04:22] touch he knows everything he made you
[2:04:25] but when it says it says he knows he
[2:04:28] says he knows how to deal with man he
[2:04:31] knows what's in man and then he says he
[2:04:34] he knows him we don't we only know from
[2:04:38] the intellectual side
[2:04:41] he knows what's really in the man
[2:04:48] we only know from the intellectual side
[2:04:51] my mind these things can kill you you
[2:04:54] know oftentimes we get information
[2:04:56] processing comparing charts come out and
[2:04:59] I don't know if your brain works like
[2:05:00] that I know it's like you get
[2:05:02] information and you go you look at your
[2:05:04] your storage your database and your
[2:05:06] check is this really something that
[2:05:09] could happen and you compare with
[2:05:10] everything else that you've heard and
[2:05:12] all of that and you come to a conclusion
[2:05:13] not happening why because I don't have
[2:05:16] any records of it happening before you
[2:05:19] know and all that God says that's your
[2:05:21] intellectual side now he think about who
[2:05:24] we're dealing with here this is the
[2:05:26] creator of Heaven and Earth you know
[2:05:28] this is not your life this is his life
[2:05:30] what it's looking for is for you to come
[2:05:32] out of your life and come into his life
[2:05:34] his life is where all things are
[2:05:37] possible your life is a mortal life it
[2:05:39] will come to an end but his life is
[2:05:41] Immortal he's a it's the very beginning
[2:05:44] and the ending he's the one who knows
[2:05:47] the end and before the beginning
[2:05:51] oh my let me just run for the second
[2:05:53] time now he speaks and it says
[2:05:57] he speaks in the message God's Wrath
[2:05:59] gives it says but all the things but
[2:06:02] about all things
[2:06:04] but all things are foreign of God he
[2:06:08] says that works together for the good of
[2:06:10] them that love him he was ordained of
[2:06:13] God that they should be there should be
[2:06:15] a heartless King in that day a
[2:06:18] bloodthirsty uh Herod God knew that
[2:06:22] no God knew about that he says God knew
[2:06:25] about the tax the taxes and how this
[2:06:29] brutal government uh did that to have no
[2:06:32] thoughts of of Mercy on those poor
[2:06:34] mothers it says that was just about that
[2:06:38] was just about to to be ready for the
[2:06:40] delivery to deliver her firstborn son
[2:06:43] just in few days but he commanded that
[2:06:47] there should be that they should come to
[2:06:49] the native birthplace and pay taxes it
[2:06:52] says no matter what condition she's in
[2:06:55] she's got to come anyhow God knew all
[2:07:00] about that
[2:07:01] he foreknew all things he knows all
[2:07:05] things and he makes everything work
[2:07:08] together
[2:07:09] for good
[2:07:12] what's your situation this morning
[2:07:16] it's it's hidden to me but it's revealed
[2:07:19] to God
[2:07:20] there is nothing that we go through that
[2:07:22] God doesn't know
[2:07:24] you know oftentimes we you know the
[2:07:27] scripture will speak and you know we
[2:07:29] people are wanting to sell this
[2:07:31] Christianity that's without a trial you
[2:07:35] know oh if you become a Christian all
[2:07:37] the things will be Rosy and you all have
[2:07:40] to face pain or anything and all of that
[2:07:42] and all right don't ever buy that
[2:07:46] don't ever bite her it says I have
[2:07:49] become a Christian to fight I have
[2:07:52] become a Christian to get into the fight
[2:07:54] we have not been called to a picnic
[2:07:57] we've been called to a battlefield we we
[2:07:59] have a real enemy who's after us so
[2:08:02] therefore when you become a Christian
[2:08:04] God has given you the weapon or the
[2:08:07] ability for you to pull down his kingdom
[2:08:11] and I want to say this because this is
[2:08:13] very important oftentimes even as
[2:08:15] Christians yet we are often damn things
[2:08:18] happening and people have this passive
[2:08:21] attitude oh you know what God will do it
[2:08:23] when he wants to do it and no that's not
[2:08:26] what we are called a true a True
[2:08:28] Believers don't want to see the devil
[2:08:31] come when he sees the devil attack he's
[2:08:34] ready to fight he's ready to go to fight
[2:08:37] he will fight till the end a True
[2:08:40] Believer doesn't give up will talk about
[2:08:42] that dog he says if I didn't have any
[2:08:45] teeth I will come amen it's not the size
[2:08:47] of the dog but it's size of the fight in
[2:08:50] the dog a True Believer is ready to
[2:08:52] attack the enemy wherever he sees him
[2:08:54] come
[2:08:56] don't don't have this passive attitude
[2:08:58] God will do it no the reason why you
[2:09:01] feel bad about it is because God wants
[2:09:03] you to do something about it
[2:09:06] and let me say this I wasn't praying to
[2:09:08] say it but I'll just say it but when I'm
[2:09:10] I can't I don't remember what message I
[2:09:12] was listening to he talks about a kid
[2:09:14] who was eating up with cancer on his
[2:09:16] mouth was in the hospital and he says
[2:09:18] his tongue was coming out even funny he
[2:09:21] said naturally I looked at him I
[2:09:23] couldn't stay there longer
[2:09:26] naturally I looked at him I said I
[2:09:29] couldn't even I didn't have a string and
[2:09:31] the father called him to pray and I'm
[2:09:33] paraphrasing this and he came and he
[2:09:35] looked at him it says within his heart
[2:09:37] he began to pray he just said it says I
[2:09:41] know the great Jehovah who created all
[2:09:44] Heaven and Earth he said you didn't
[2:09:46] create this kid to be this way or to go
[2:09:49] through what they're going through oh
[2:09:51] father if you can only do something and
[2:09:54] then he says and then he heard a voice
[2:09:55] speak to him and says I was waiting to
[2:09:57] see what you were going to do
[2:10:00] I was waiting to see what you were going
[2:10:02] to do oftentimes we take it and we just
[2:10:05] give it in God oh no God wants to see
[2:10:07] what your reaction is going to be are
[2:10:09] you gonna go to battle or are you just
[2:10:12] gonna look at it are you gonna go to
[2:10:13] battle and fight or you're just going to
[2:10:15] look at it but when I'm says this and
[2:10:18] I've always loved the squad you probably
[2:10:19] heard me read it before
[2:10:22] he speaks about our trials he says uh oh
[2:10:25] okay this is in the prayer says give us
[2:10:27] our hearts desire we says we are truly
[2:10:31] we truly have this desires to serve you
[2:10:34] in this witness
[2:10:37] weakening conditions and affliction and
[2:10:40] the things of the world that are put
[2:10:41] Upon Us sometimes to perfect us he says
[2:10:44] we've been told that and then he said
[2:10:47] think of thinking not strange that these
[2:10:51] trials will come they are only working
[2:10:53] out for you for for our good and to
[2:10:57] perfect us and to bring us into that
[2:11:00] place what place the place that he has
[2:11:03] for you he says these great deserts of
[2:11:07] experience where righteous men are
[2:11:10] molded into Saints
[2:11:14] these deserts of experiences will
[2:11:18] experience where righteous men are
[2:11:20] molded into Saints we thank thee for
[2:11:22] this experience Lord we would not he
[2:11:25] says we says we would we would no means
[2:11:28] no wise want to do anything contrary to
[2:11:32] your will in other words saying is if my
[2:11:36] way be forward try
[2:11:37] if my wife will feed forward battles if
[2:11:40] my wife will fall with all of these
[2:11:42] things God I'll take it gladly I'll grow
[2:11:45] the way that you want me to go I don't
[2:11:47] want to detract to the left or to the
[2:11:49] right the way that you want me to go
[2:11:51] that's the way I will go because I
[2:11:54] understand that all those things are
[2:11:56] sent to perfect me
[2:12:03] it says and sometimes we think that our
[2:12:06] burdens
[2:12:08] am I just inject in here that we think
[2:12:11] our burdens are so heavy sometimes that
[2:12:14] there's nothing like it in the world how
[2:12:17] many feel like that sometimes
[2:12:18] like I don't know how I'm gonna make it
[2:12:20] out of this
[2:12:22] it says this isn't a message we have
[2:12:24] seen a star paragraph 47 42 and then it
[2:12:27] says
[2:12:29] do you know that all those things are
[2:12:31] good for you
[2:12:34] did you say good for me
[2:12:39] good for you
[2:12:41] it says they are all
[2:12:44] to mold you make you
[2:12:47] prophets and Sages
[2:12:50] was molded
[2:12:52] on the backside of the desert in the hot
[2:12:55] blazing sun
[2:12:58] it says through tribulations and trials
[2:13:01] and persecutions and these things that
[2:13:03] we have today there's nothing perhaps
[2:13:07] there is nothing happening to us that
[2:13:10] hasn't happened to other Christians
[2:13:12] before
[2:13:14] other Christians had had to stand in the
[2:13:18] hour of Darkness like this and even be
[2:13:21] fed up the lion fed the lion for the
[2:13:24] testimonies
[2:13:28] let's fight
[2:13:30] don't say war is me say thank you Lord
[2:13:34] thank you Father I don't understand it
[2:13:37] I I can't explain it but I know you're
[2:13:40] doing something
[2:13:42] it's because you want to perfect me it's
[2:13:45] because you want me to go continue to
[2:13:47] fight and I tell you this if all of
[2:13:50] those things are taken out what benefit
[2:13:52] will they be to be a Christian
[2:13:54] so you could just be happy lucky and
[2:13:56] jumping up and all of that no a
[2:13:58] Christian is the one who can intercede
[2:14:00] and the intercession comes when you
[2:14:03] understand what someone is going through
[2:14:06] so when you stand there you said Lord
[2:14:07] God heal that person you know what that
[2:14:10] means why because you have had to go
[2:14:13] through that
[2:14:18] so now we understand that they're going
[2:14:22] forth into Bethlehem
[2:14:26] it was all designed by predestination or
[2:14:28] by foreknowledge because God knew that
[2:14:31] the son that Jesus was to be born in
[2:14:34] Bethlehem
[2:14:35] and we don't have time to go through it
[2:14:37] but brahmanam will talk about you know
[2:14:39] we know he preached a message why he had
[2:14:42] to be Bethlehem and he speaks for the
[2:14:43] reason and I would just summarize this
[2:14:47] these are a few of the people that are
[2:14:49] connected directly to Bethlehem in fact
[2:14:51] if you go to channel I'm sorry to
[2:14:53] Matthew chapter one it speaks about the
[2:14:55] genealogy of Jesus you could see the
[2:14:58] whole line and how it got to how it got
[2:15:01] to Joseph and down to Jesus and but when
[2:15:03] I'm going to say that this this city of
[2:15:06] Bethlehem he says he was established and
[2:15:08] founded by one of Caleb's Sons
[2:15:11] and he spoke about how that they limit
[2:15:14] and his wife Naomi were connected they
[2:15:17] came from Bethlehem Boaz who was the
[2:15:19] Kingman Kingsman who was married to
[2:15:21] Naomi and who was the kingsman for elima
[2:15:24] like we understand that he came from
[2:15:26] Bethlehem oh bad the son of Boaz and
[2:15:29] Ruth and uh and uh by Ruth basically
[2:15:34] because we understand that Boaz had to
[2:15:36] come and redeem them and marry Ruth and
[2:15:39] then from then on they had Boaz and
[2:15:41] Jesse the son of Obed the father of
[2:15:44] David and Joseph was a descendant of the
[2:15:46] household of David as the Bible will say
[2:15:48] and then Jesus
[2:15:51] the Messiah will find out that he also
[2:15:54] spoke about how you you will take how
[2:15:58] even Reya became connected to Bethlehem
[2:16:00] for the fact that he married the general
[2:16:03] who who came from the army of Israel and
[2:16:06] was married to him and she was married
[2:16:09] to her and and why ahead because
[2:16:11] Bethlehem was part of Judah
[2:16:14] and we know that new Kings come unless
[2:16:17] it comes out of Judah
[2:16:18] that's why they have to go he drive them
[2:16:21] all the way and but he says what is
[2:16:23] Bethlehem
[2:16:25] it says it's the house of God's bread
[2:16:28] and every believer has to be born in
[2:16:32] Bethlehem every believer has to be born
[2:16:36] in this place why because that was where
[2:16:38] the living bread came from
[2:16:43] I could explain but I don't have time
[2:16:46] we
[2:16:48] every it's the
[2:16:50] and it's directly connected why Jesus
[2:16:54] will stand on the day or Passover and
[2:16:56] says I am the bread
[2:16:58] that's come down from heaven
[2:17:01] you eat of the natural bread you die
[2:17:04] because it was a feast they were all
[2:17:06] eating bread and all of those things he
[2:17:08] looks at him he says I am the living
[2:17:10] bread of life
[2:17:12] if you eat of that natural bread you
[2:17:14] will eat it but I at the end you shall
[2:17:17] die but if you eat of this bread you
[2:17:19] shall live and that's when they took him
[2:17:21] and they wanted to kill him
[2:17:23] so so and you would say Bethlehem was
[2:17:28] the lowest place that there was
[2:17:34] Bethlehem was the lowest place that
[2:17:37] there was I think about the prophet's
[2:17:40] message and some of the things that he
[2:17:41] speaks about himself he said being a kid
[2:17:44] has said I would wear a coat and I
[2:17:46] didn't have any shirt on and I had it
[2:17:47] buttoned up and I was sweating out but I
[2:17:49] didn't open I didn't want to open
[2:17:50] because I didn't have I could relate to
[2:17:53] that
[2:17:55] he he didn't send this gospel but upon
[2:17:57] Him says to the wise to the reaches and
[2:18:00] to the others he founded the lowest
[2:18:04] place that there was
[2:18:06] to send this gospel
[2:18:09] God is the god who takes nothing
[2:18:12] and makes something out of it
[2:18:15] if we come here and we think we are
[2:18:17] somebody God will never use us
[2:18:19] if our gathering is made of
[2:18:21] intellectuals in our degrees and our
[2:18:24] things that our achievements our jobs
[2:18:26] our ability to read and write and expand
[2:18:29] and explain we are lost
[2:18:33] but if we understand that all of that
[2:18:35] amounts to nothing
[2:18:37] God can come and use us why because he's
[2:18:41] looking for the nothing so he can make
[2:18:43] something out of it why because he's
[2:18:45] looking for the lowest so he could have
[2:18:47] if it's already elevated what can he do
[2:18:49] about it he he could have oh think about
[2:18:52] the celebration if he would have come to
[2:18:54] the Pharisees and all of them think
[2:18:56] about all the parties and all of those
[2:18:58] that it was going to vindicate what they
[2:19:01] were saying but he came to the humble
[2:19:04] through the poor to the needy to the
[2:19:07] little to the poor in spirit that he can
[2:19:11] come and make himself known
[2:19:15] says there was no room for him in the
[2:19:18] end
[2:19:19] and I just want to summarize this
[2:19:22] because I know like I said I don't plan
[2:19:24] to try to be too long
[2:19:26] he asked a question
[2:19:28] he came and there was no room in the nas
[2:19:31] what was he rejected and and I just
[2:19:34] summarized because it would just take
[2:19:36] too long to go through each one
[2:19:38] he says why did I refuse it
[2:19:42] why couldn't they see it
[2:19:45] why didn't they turn
[2:19:47] why did he turn it down
[2:19:49] why did why didn't they want it
[2:19:54] says the same reason they don't want it
[2:19:57] tonight
[2:20:01] it was it wasn't handed to them in the
[2:20:05] custom that they were used to gift being
[2:20:08] handed
[2:20:10] I want you to think about that
[2:20:12] it was given it wasn't given in the
[2:20:15] custom that they are used to having
[2:20:17] gifts
[2:20:18] that's the reason they rejected it yet
[2:20:21] tonight he's speaking about then he's
[2:20:23] speaking about today it's because it's
[2:20:25] not handed to people in the custom
[2:20:28] that they've been used to receiving
[2:20:31] gifts
[2:20:36] and what about them go on to say
[2:20:41] but God wrapped his own package
[2:20:45] he's got the right to do it
[2:20:48] he's the one
[2:20:50] that's giving it
[2:20:52] he has the right to wrap it any way he
[2:20:55] wants to wrap it
[2:20:58] it doesn't make any difference how it is
[2:21:01] he's got the right to do it because
[2:21:05] he's the one that's giving the gift
[2:21:10] you're like why are they receiving why
[2:21:13] are they not receive this message
[2:21:15] why have they rejected or why have that
[2:21:19] rejected this word this message that
[2:21:22] came in this Prophet who will stand the
[2:21:24] night after night and it will raise the
[2:21:26] dead and and do this greater miracle and
[2:21:29] will bring crowd into the the the myths
[2:21:32] and the churches will grow and all it
[2:21:35] did he did nothing but good
[2:21:38] he did nothing but Prosper them and and
[2:21:41] helped them grow their churches never
[2:21:43] came with the intention he will he will
[2:21:46] pick days where he knew that they didn't
[2:21:48] have churches because he didn't want to
[2:21:50] draw people from his building and he
[2:21:52] will find time and he will tell people
[2:21:54] or if you have church don't come today
[2:21:56] go back to your local church he did all
[2:21:58] of that why did I reject it
[2:22:02] he says because see it came in the way
[2:22:05] that they were not the receiving gifts
[2:22:08] but in one place but one of them he says
[2:22:10] he says they rejected it because they
[2:22:13] were not predestinated to receive it
[2:22:16] they're rejected it because they were
[2:22:18] not part of what God was trying to build
[2:22:21] and he says the rejected it also let me
[2:22:24] just if I could sum it up tonight this
[2:22:26] morning they rejected it because it was
[2:22:30] contrary to the custom in what they
[2:22:33] believe what how they view everything
[2:22:35] how everything should operate this
[2:22:38] message when he came he was in conflict
[2:22:41] with the lies that's why they wouldn't
[2:22:43] reject they wouldn't receive it and in
[2:22:45] one place he says they rejected it
[2:22:48] because when the message came they had
[2:22:52] to give up something this message when
[2:22:54] it comes to you you have to give up
[2:22:56] something and they didn't want to give
[2:22:58] up anything they wanted their life to
[2:23:01] remain the way it was they didn't want
[2:23:03] the reproach of it
[2:23:06] now I'm no longer talking about their
[2:23:08] churches I'm talking about us the reason
[2:23:10] why people don't fully Embrace a message
[2:23:13] is sometimes they they don't want
[2:23:16] something that will change your
[2:23:17] lifestyle you know people some people
[2:23:19] want a clean fun you know a clean fun
[2:23:22] they want to you know they want a
[2:23:25] separation I've said this before between
[2:23:27] them and the word they don't want to be
[2:23:29] fully emerged because it's going to
[2:23:31] condemn them so they want to celebrate
[2:23:33] and do things like the world does but
[2:23:36] they still also want to be part of the
[2:23:37] message if you are lukewarm it will
[2:23:39] vomit you out of his mouth they don't
[2:23:42] want to fully give in they don't want
[2:23:44] the reproach they don't want they don't
[2:23:46] want a message that will make a mess out
[2:23:48] of them they don't want a message that
[2:23:50] will cause them to cry and to give their
[2:23:53] lives to God and they don't want a
[2:23:55] message that will come and take away
[2:23:57] sins and and change lives and a message
[2:24:00] that will come and cut out the things of
[2:24:02] the world
[2:24:04] no there's a part of us that wants to
[2:24:07] preserve
[2:24:08] some things that we just don't want to
[2:24:10] give up you know I I believe the message
[2:24:13] but you know this is I don't see you
[2:24:16] know all things are lawful I don't
[2:24:17] really see they don't want to give up
[2:24:19] certain things
[2:24:21] and I wonder this morning if we have
[2:24:22] certain things like that if we do we
[2:24:25] have not fully received them
[2:24:29] when you receive it
[2:24:31] not you
[2:24:32] the message is there to flesh out
[2:24:35] everything
[2:24:36] it will tell you this is not it take it
[2:24:38] out this is not it this is not it this
[2:24:42] is not it David said oh thy loving
[2:24:45] kindness is better than life
[2:24:48] but when I'm says they are here they are
[2:24:50] they're drinking and smoking and and
[2:24:52] rejoicing and committing all kind of
[2:24:54] immoral things he says they call that
[2:24:57] life that's death
[2:24:59] that's death what kind of life it is
[2:25:03] that you get drunk and you do all kinds
[2:25:06] of things and and all kinds of immoral
[2:25:08] stuff and you come back and you regret
[2:25:10] for all the things you've done
[2:25:11] what kind of life is that what kind of
[2:25:14] life that would cause you to be addicted
[2:25:17] to cigarettes or to things and you you
[2:25:19] smoke and you do all of that and it
[2:25:21] causes lung cancer and you die
[2:25:23] and you call that life that's not life
[2:25:26] that's death but David will say that
[2:25:29] loving kindness is better than life to
[2:25:31] me in other words the life that comes by
[2:25:34] him and let me say this today people
[2:25:36] think that we are here that we are bound
[2:25:39] and we are slaves and because of the way
[2:25:41] we dress and all of those things you
[2:25:43] think that's that's freedom to me that's
[2:25:46] the freedom of the Holy Ghost you don't
[2:25:48] have to do something that you don't have
[2:25:50] to you don't have to dress like the
[2:25:52] world you don't have to call somebody to
[2:25:55] fall because of the way you dress and
[2:25:56] you don't have to tell a dirty joke and
[2:25:59] cause somebody to do wrong that's Purity
[2:26:01] to me
[2:26:03] amen you call that Liberty Liberty when
[2:26:07] you go spend and you get drunk and when
[2:26:09] you get sober all of your problems are
[2:26:12] still there
[2:26:16] Liberty when you are addicted you don't
[2:26:18] have enough money to buy food but yet
[2:26:20] you have enough money to buy alcohol and
[2:26:23] cigarette
[2:26:25] you got that Liberty when you you you
[2:26:27] you get so addicted to video games that
[2:26:31] people die while playing
[2:26:34] that's Liberty
[2:26:37] that sounds like bondage to me
[2:26:40] you call it Liberty when you wake up and
[2:26:43] and you are this one and no one is
[2:26:45] looking for you and they're looking for
[2:26:46] you you are everybody and you you live
[2:26:49] in constant fear you don't know what's
[2:26:51] going to happen to you you call that
[2:26:53] Liberty that's not Liberty
[2:26:56] Liberty you they call it Liberty you you
[2:26:59] you you you go out and and and you come
[2:27:02] back and your house is all alarmed and
[2:27:04] everything and you block everything up
[2:27:06] so nobody will steal you call that
[2:27:08] Liberty
[2:27:09] that's not Liberty and the scripture
[2:27:12] says Heaven and Earth will pass away it
[2:27:15] don't matter I tell you this people go
[2:27:16] to the gym and they do all kinds of
[2:27:18] exercising a week later they die
[2:27:23] oh there's only one form of Liberty and
[2:27:27] that's the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:27:28] there's only one form of Liberty and
[2:27:31] that's the word we have received this
[2:27:34] world will change your life this world
[2:27:36] will change your body when it comes time
[2:27:38] to it this word will give you the life
[2:27:41] that you were supposed to have in the
[2:27:43] first place
[2:27:47] let me say this
[2:27:49] Heaven and Earth all of those things are
[2:27:52] temporal there's only one thing that's
[2:27:54] eternal and that's the word of God
[2:27:57] and I want to invite us tonight and this
[2:27:59] morning and just say
[2:28:01] oh my
[2:28:04] let's not run away from it
[2:28:07] let's be committed with everything
[2:28:10] within us
[2:28:11] let's be fully committed
[2:28:16] you say well
[2:28:18] I received the message
[2:28:22] the scripture says Jesus said he said if
[2:28:24] you love me
[2:28:25] you'll keep my commandment
[2:28:28] that's the end of it
[2:28:31] if you love me
[2:28:32] you'll keep my commandment I'm not
[2:28:35] talking about something you're
[2:28:36] struggling with he's there to take it
[2:28:39] out of you he's there to give you the
[2:28:41] victory as long as there is something in
[2:28:43] you that don't want it he will come and
[2:28:45] it will give you the victory I'm talking
[2:28:47] about things that you know and you never
[2:28:50] pay any mind to it
[2:28:55] he says they didn't want to pay the cost
[2:28:59] you know there's a cost to being a
[2:29:01] Christian
[2:29:03] Jesus said I Sanctified myself for their
[2:29:06] sake
[2:29:10] you know our pastor comes in near day in
[2:29:12] and day out and and he stands and he
[2:29:15] studies and he does all of that it's
[2:29:18] it's it's to help us
[2:29:24] it's to feed us the word
[2:29:27] it's to let us know what God Said and
[2:29:30] what God is requiring
[2:29:32] and I believe as Believers just think a
[2:29:34] word fellowshipping in the brother's
[2:29:36] breakfast I believe last weekend and
[2:29:38] we're talking about you know the
[2:29:40] desperation I said oh just think about
[2:29:43] it as Believers if we can get in
[2:29:45] desperation you know we read often time
[2:29:48] and the scripture will say you know
[2:29:49] Jesus and then he'd done this and he
[2:29:51] went here and he did this we can even
[2:29:53] talk about the prophet we talk about the
[2:29:54] third full manifestation and all of that
[2:29:56] and we could say but yet we are here and
[2:29:59] those things we're talking about it as
[2:30:00] they were right there
[2:30:03] how come we're not getting that
[2:30:05] desperation
[2:30:08] if God promised it
[2:30:10] a Believer he's one who pulls Heaven
[2:30:13] down
[2:30:14] but when I'm says you pray till you take
[2:30:17] the promises of God and you bring him
[2:30:19] down
[2:30:20] that's what God wants us to do it's not
[2:30:23] one with a passive attitude oh God I
[2:30:26] pray you give it to me amen no he wants
[2:30:28] you to fight for it he wants you to show
[2:30:31] that you want it he wants to see that
[2:30:34] you really need it the scripture says
[2:30:36] that the kingdom of God People Press
[2:30:38] into it in other words they go with
[2:30:41] force and they say God I want this like
[2:30:44] like talk about Uncle Buddy Robinson I'm
[2:30:47] not living here until you give me the
[2:30:49] Holy Ghost that's the kind of attitude
[2:30:52] we need to have not a passive attitude
[2:30:54] well no people on fire for God they want
[2:30:57] to see God move in the midst they want
[2:30:59] to see healing in the midst they're not
[2:31:01] just for them for other people they want
[2:31:03] to see a a sinner walk in and then the
[2:31:06] word is spoken and God changes his life
[2:31:11] that's the third pool and that's the
[2:31:13] time we are living in what the word has
[2:31:16] moved from the head and it is in the
[2:31:18] bride don't we say that the word is in
[2:31:21] the bride and says the same power
[2:31:24] quickening power moves from the body
[2:31:27] from the head into the body
[2:31:30] he says this if the musician could come
[2:31:32] up I'll just
[2:31:35] I'll just
[2:31:36] jump quickly here so I can get to it
[2:31:38] close
[2:31:57] he says
[2:32:00] foreign
[2:32:03] I wondered tonight in the building
[2:32:06] in this building
[2:32:08] of this Christmas time
[2:32:11] it says in commemoration of nearly two
[2:32:13] thousand years ago when God
[2:32:16] gave the first Christmas gift I wonder
[2:32:19] tonight if you'd like to look inside of
[2:32:21] the package
[2:32:23] and see sinners
[2:32:26] that there isn't somebody
[2:32:28] in in there who would love somebody
[2:32:33] who died for you somebody who gave the
[2:32:36] life for you
[2:32:38] would be willing tonight to take the
[2:32:41] swaddling cloth off of him and dirty
[2:32:43] cloth
[2:32:45] that they call it the fanatic and the
[2:32:47] Holy Roller and wrap himself in it and
[2:32:50] take the way of the Lord despise few
[2:32:53] it says if you are in the building
[2:32:55] tonight
[2:32:58] like to remember in like to be
[2:33:00] remembered in prayer it says would you
[2:33:03] raise your hand and say oh this
[2:33:06] Christmas night I want to receive
[2:33:08] Christmas gift of God
[2:33:11] God's true Christmas gift God bless you
[2:33:13] lady God bless you girly God bless you
[2:33:16] Sister God bless you God bless you the
[2:33:18] young lady God there there it says there
[2:33:22] there'll be some more that would like to
[2:33:23] remain remember God bless you brother
[2:33:26] now he says one place
[2:33:31] that in the first time when it came it
[2:33:34] was God's gift wrapped in Christ
[2:33:37] but it says but in the end time
[2:33:40] is the gift wrapped inside into Sons and
[2:33:43] Daughters of God
[2:33:48] what was whether the first gift that
[2:33:51] came that was wrapped into Christ did
[2:33:56] it gave his life for others
[2:33:59] what is the second coming
[2:34:03] gift coming into the sons of daughters
[2:34:05] supposed to do
[2:34:07] give his life for others
[2:34:11] we have the word in our meds
[2:34:16] but God is wanting us to put the Christ
[2:34:18] right back into Christmas
[2:34:21] understanding it's not about theology
[2:34:25] it's not about what I can say it's not
[2:34:27] what about what I can expose or what I
[2:34:29] could do
[2:34:30] but it's about Christ being born in my
[2:34:32] heart
[2:34:33] they said oh God
[2:34:36] truly what I desire is your birth in my
[2:34:39] heart to produce the works that you have
[2:34:42] predestinated for me to produce
[2:34:44] now he said a lot had rejected him
[2:34:47] remember we went through he would speak
[2:34:49] about how because they didn't want what
[2:34:51] the Holy Ghost will do with them
[2:34:54] they didn't want to give up something
[2:34:56] they they were happy with the way they
[2:34:58] were you know sometimes you had to
[2:35:02] realize
[2:35:04] for a person to need Christ for a person
[2:35:07] to want Christ but when I must say that
[2:35:09] they have to be in the condition where
[2:35:11] they need them
[2:35:15] if a person is there where everything is
[2:35:18] working well for him they have no need
[2:35:20] of it but God knows how to bring the
[2:35:22] need something will go wrong and
[2:35:24] oftentimes things do
[2:35:26] it says then when you come with the gift
[2:35:29] of Life they realize I need this I need
[2:35:31] something my money can give me my fame
[2:35:34] can give me my connections cannot buy me
[2:35:37] all of those things cannot get me and
[2:35:40] that's when they come in real estate
[2:35:41] realization I need this
[2:35:45] and all
[2:35:46] work on Earth
[2:35:48] is to be that Christmas for them
[2:35:51] is to realize that I have been placed
[2:35:53] here and but for me to do it I need this
[2:35:55] power to move through me I need his work
[2:35:58] to be made a reality in my heart
[2:36:01] he said they rejected him
[2:36:04] but remember
[2:36:06] there were predestinated wise men
[2:36:09] that were sent specifically so they can
[2:36:13] recognize him
[2:36:14] we have seen a star
[2:36:16] and have come to worship him what was it
[2:36:19] while even in Jerusalem King Herod and
[2:36:23] all the people sitting around they had
[2:36:25] no idea what was happening yet there
[2:36:28] were three men from the East
[2:36:29] [Music]
[2:36:31] three men who saw his star they came all
[2:36:35] the way to worship him why they were
[2:36:37] predestinated to see it they were
[2:36:39] predestinated to view him to see him now
[2:36:43] I want to say this I want you to realize
[2:36:45] when they came
[2:36:47] they all didn't have the same gifts that
[2:36:50] they brought forth
[2:36:52] each one had his own revelation
[2:36:55] about who this person was
[2:36:57] one said oh I could recognize deity had
[2:37:01] gold
[2:37:03] significance of the deity one came and
[2:37:06] he had myrrh and all those things and
[2:37:09] and one came and he recognized him as a
[2:37:11] priest one came and recognized it in his
[2:37:13] death they came and recognized it for
[2:37:15] the different things but it was all of
[2:37:17] those things
[2:37:18] [Music]
[2:37:22] oh I say tonight this morning
[2:37:25] I want to come into Revelation that he's
[2:37:27] given me and I want him to reveal more
[2:37:30] and more himself to me so I may know who
[2:37:33] he is and worship him in the way that he
[2:37:36] wants me to worship him I can only
[2:37:38] worship it based on my Revelation I can
[2:37:42] only worship on based on what he has
[2:37:44] revealed to him if I say anything
[2:37:46] outside of what is made known unto me I
[2:37:49] become an idolater a contrary
[2:37:54] let's all stand
[2:37:56] oh

[2:38:00] Christ may be your Christmas this
