[5:44] Good
[5:45] morning. Happy Mother's Day for those I
[5:48] know a lot are out seeing their mothers.
[5:51] I I thought of it this morning. This is
[5:53] my first Mother's Day without my mother.
[5:57] So, it's been 102 years I had Mother's
[6:00] Day. So, uh that was a lot of presents.
[6:05] But uh you know so someone asked me what
[6:09] did you get Lesie? I said she's not my
[6:12] mother. But uh anyway so we're we're
[6:16] happy to be here this morning. All of
[6:18] you that have come out. Uh I I hope we
[6:21] have some online. We're going to make
[6:23] this announcement a couple announcements
[6:26] before we start service this morning.
[6:28] Then I have brother Kim come and give.
[6:30] He has an announcement. Uh but um we
[6:35] need to make sure that our parents are
[6:39] watching their children in the
[6:42] restroom because I know I know your
[6:46] kids's an angel, but it's the other
[6:49] people's
[6:50] kids. You you know what I mean? that uh
[6:54] but like one of them stepped, you know,
[6:56] tried to look over the stall at the
[6:58] other one and stepped up on top of the
[7:00] toilet paper holder and tore it off the
[7:03] wall and and then they leave the water
[7:05] on. So, I mean, I don't know how mature
[7:09] your child is, but I imagine if he's
[7:12] under 12, you might have to uh uh make
[7:16] sure that he gets in and out and you
[7:19] could check on them. So, if they're gone
[7:22] a few minutes longer than than you would
[7:26] think, you might want to consider that
[7:29] they've got something going on. And it's
[7:33] not a meeting room, you know, either.
[7:35] The restrooms aren't. So, a lot of times
[7:38] the sisters get over there and they'll
[7:40] all gab in the but that's an extension
[7:43] of the
[7:44] sanctuary. So, just think of it that
[7:47] way. And uh uh also uh in the pews you
[7:53] have to watch what kind of
[7:57] material you'll have your kids draw
[8:00] with. I'm not going to say you can't
[8:02] have your kids draw, but uh we have
[8:06] crayons in the seats and indelible
[8:09] markers and uh all kinds of different uh
[8:14] things are are getting on the pews. So,
[8:17] we have to I'm being a mother today.
[8:21] This is me mothering the
[8:23] church. And that's it. I'm not the the
[8:26] great harlot mother, you know. So, this
[8:29] isn't the mother church. It's just me
[8:32] telling you things that we need to be
[8:34] careful of. And
[8:36] also we want to take the fellowship out
[8:40] of the
[8:41] forer into the fellowship hall or
[8:46] outside. No visiting in the
[8:49] forer. Okay. The forer is you have those
[8:54] two doors there and then you've got two
[8:57] other doors. The space between the two
[9:00] doors is the forer where the big board
[9:02] is. And no, don't talk in there. move on
[9:08] out outside or just go right out into
[9:11] the other forer and then or go over into
[9:14] the other room over there and fellowship
[9:17] because we have people praying in here
[9:20] and then you open those doors and
[9:22] there's a big roar and laughing, you
[9:25] know, and somebody might have been put
[9:27] under conviction and they're here trying
[9:29] to get right with God and you're out
[9:32] there having a jubilee or something and
[9:35] and then that creates
[9:38] uh quite a bit of a a different
[9:41] atmosphere. So, we just want we're just
[9:44] trying to create the right kind of
[9:46] atmosphere. So, I think that's what's
[9:48] important. So, if you could really help
[9:51] with those two things uh or those three
[9:55] things, it would make things go better.
[9:58] So, uh, anyway, so everybody watch out
[10:02] for the other person's
[10:04] children because your children are
[10:06] angels. And watch out what material
[10:09] we're drawing on the pews with. So, no
[10:13] indelible pens or pens or crayons. Uh,
[10:17] invisible ink would probably be the best
[10:20] thing to use. And then no
[10:23] fellowship in the forer. It's way too
[10:26] loud. Now, I'm I'm if you want to say
[10:28] God bless you or shake a hand, keep it
[10:30] down and reverent and move on out. We're
[10:34] not opposed to that. So, um um we want
[10:39] to do that. And and brother Tim, I know
[10:41] you might have an announcement and and
[10:44] so I know there's a lot out today. Uh
[10:47] but if you would uh pass this message
[10:50] on, Brother Tim's message to the other
[10:53] families uh that uh you might uh have
[10:58] here. God bless you, brother Tim. Bless
[11:01] you. Brother Tim's been a real blessing.
[11:03] I can't tell you
[11:05] uh what he's done for the Sunday school
[11:08] and what he's done for me personally.
[11:11] He's always been a rock in my life. His
[11:14] dad's always had a tremendous stand for
[11:17] this message and and uh he's really done
[11:20] tremendous. I don't know if you've seen
[11:22] how far Sunday school's come or how big
[11:25] it's grown, but uh Brother Tim's really
[11:30] really behind it. and I haven't even had
[11:33] to worry about it. And I know he didn't
[11:35] want to do it and he thought there could
[11:38] be somebody else, but when God picks
[11:40] somebody, it always works perfect. And
[11:43] and so I I hope he doesn't uh get a
[11:47] different direction anytime soon. But we
[11:50] love you and appreciate you, brother
[11:51] Tim.
[11:53] Appreciate those kind words. God bless
[11:55] you and welcome to the house of the Lord
[11:56] this morning. Happy Mother's Day even to
[11:59] the dads. We're we're mothers as well,
[12:01] but uh there's something special about
[12:03] mom. Um I'm just a figurehead as far as
[12:07] that goes. There's wonderful Sunday
[12:10] school teachers and and helpers that do
[12:13] it all. So um speaking of Sunday school,
[12:16] this um is the winding down already of a
[12:20] Sunday school session for this year.
[12:23] We'll go into summer break. Much needed
[12:26] break for some of our our teachers. We
[12:28] said they work hard at it. Uh so this
[12:30] Saturday we're going to have a picnic
[12:33] right out here at the new dedicated
[12:35] pavilion.
[12:36] Um and uh prior to that at
[12:41] 10:00, we'd like to have your children
[12:43] here to practice a song because next
[12:46] Sunday will be the final Sunday school
[12:48] session, but they're going to sing for
[12:50] us again. So, uh, at 10:00, uh, sharp,
[12:54] we'll have practice for the song, and
[12:57] then about 11, we'll have everything
[12:59] cranked up outside. Um, and this is the
[13:04] the hard part is that at 11, we need the
[13:09] parents to be here. So, you can drop
[13:11] your kids off for practice, but we need
[13:13] the parents on site because we're going
[13:15] to have bounce houses and a lot of
[13:17] activities going on. And uh as much as
[13:20] we are caretakers of your children,
[13:22] we're not completely responsible if
[13:24] there's an accident. We need you to be
[13:25] here to administer aid or help or you
[13:28] know that kind of thing. We just ask the
[13:30] Lord's blessing for our protection upon
[13:32] it all. But there's going to be a lot of
[13:34] activities going. So we'd like the
[13:35] parents to be back on site at 11 and
[13:38] then uh we proposed maybe through 1:00,
[13:42] 2 o'clock, whatever is necessary to to
[13:44] kind of round out a a a day.
[13:47] Um, so we're going to have practice
[13:50] beforehand 10:00 and then the picnic
[13:53] should start at 11. And uh, if you do
[13:57] have a child at Sunday school and you
[13:58] come to the picnic, we they're asking
[14:00] uh, for you to bring either a 2 liter
[14:02] drink, a dessert, or fruit to help with
[14:05] the menu. Uh, there will be plenty of
[14:07] food provided, but for all those that
[14:09] have a special drink or a dessert or
[14:13] fruit that they want to bring. Um, so
[14:15] the parents need to remain on the
[14:17] grounds until the close out of the
[14:20] picnic. And
[14:22] uh that's uh that's pretty much it. But
[14:26] uh I do appreciate having your children.
[14:28] They've been a blessing to to uh to see
[14:31] interact in and out. I think they've
[14:33] grown tremendously and uh like I said,
[14:35] we've had such a good effort from the
[14:37] from the teachers. Surely you know that
[14:39] uh they're learning and progressing uh
[14:41] in the word of God and having having
[14:43] very good oversight from from the
[14:45] wonderful sisters we have over there
[14:48] right now tending to them. So God bless
[14:50] you and uh let's uh worship the Lord
[14:53] together and and sing his praise and
[14:56] enjoy uh the benefits of of the mother
[15:01] eagle, God himself spreading his wings
[15:04] over us. He can shelter us. There's
[15:07] many, as brother David said, are without
[15:09] their mothers. I'm I'm blessed to still
[15:11] have my mom talked to her this morning
[15:13] and
[15:15] uh my heart goes out to those that have
[15:18] have lost their mother in this life. But
[15:21] I thank the Lord that he hears our
[15:22] prayer.
[15:26] I'll just relate
[15:28] this. Many times I look back
[15:33] at at the life of
[15:36] Elijah, you know, he came to a widow
[15:38] woman and we know how he provided for
[15:41] her home and sustained her and her son.
[15:44] Then the son died. Her only son
[15:49] died. And you can
[15:52] imagine the Bible says that Elijah took
[15:55] her from her bosom. He says, "Give me
[15:58] the
[15:59] child." He took him upstairs, put him on
[16:02] his own bed. Of course, he laid on him
[16:05] three times, but he called out to the
[16:08] Lord. And the Bible says the Lord heard
[16:12] the prayer of
[16:14] Elijah. He hears our prayers. Whatever
[16:17] we have need of, we submit it to him.
[16:19] And just a few days
[16:21] later, there he was against the prophets
[16:24] of Baal. He says, "Hear me, oh Lord.
[16:27] Hear my prayer that these people may
[16:30] know that their heart is turned back to
[16:33] you." So, let's turn our hearts back to
[16:35] him. God bless
[16:40] you. Amen. Why don't we stand this
[16:43] morning? So good to be gather in the
[16:45] house of God. Amen. Oh, welcome, Holy
[16:49] Spirit.
[16:51] [Music]

[16:56] [Music]

[19:24] he may come and live inside of us. Amen.
[19:27] Brother Andrew, if we could just come
[19:28] and open our service in prayer. Amen.
[19:45] Welcome everybody. So good to be in his
[19:48] presence. How many are happy to be in
[19:50] the house of the Lord? Amen. You know, I
[19:52] just feel like something good is about
[19:54] to happen. Amen. You know, we come here
[19:57] as his children, and I just believe he
[20:00] wants to be here to pour out all of his
[20:02] blessings, to encourage us, to
[20:04] strengthen us, to take those broken
[20:07] places and men them by the word of God.
[20:11] Let's go to him in prayer. Heavenly
[20:13] Father, Lord, we thank you, God, that
[20:16] Lord, you're such a loving God, Lord.
[20:18] And Lord, the world would say, "How do
[20:21] you know?" Well Lord, we just look to
[20:24] Calvary, Lord, and we see, oh God, Lord,
[20:28] no one took your life, but you gave it
[20:30] willingly, Lord, and you even spoke to
[20:33] him. You said, "Destroy this temple, and
[20:35] I'll raise it up within three days,
[20:37] Father. Lord, here we are, Lord, to
[20:39] honor that great promise of
[20:42] resurrection, Lord. Come this morning,
[20:44] Lord. Resurrect within us, Lord, the
[20:47] very joy and peace and love and joy and
[20:50] kindness, oh God, the fruit of the
[20:52] spirit. Let it flow, oh God. Lord, you
[20:55] see, oh God, the cry of your heart's
[20:57] children, Lord, as we lift up our hearts
[20:59] to you, Lord, in praise and worship and
[21:02] thanksgiving. Father, come, Lord. Feel
[21:05] welcome, Lord. We want to honor you and
[21:08] worship you, Lord, with our joy, with
[21:10] the satisfaction of the life that you've
[21:13] given us, Lord. Come now, Lord. Lord,
[21:15] bless the musicians, Lord. The
[21:17] technicians in the back, the deacons,
[21:19] Lord, every heart here, Lord. We want to
[21:21] get in one mind and one accord that you
[21:24] can come and oh God, speak to hearts and
[21:26] change lives, Lord. Build within us,
[21:28] Lord, the very virtue of the loving
[21:30] Savior. We commit the time to you, Lord.
[21:33] When we leave here, Lord, let us go like
[21:36] those that were coming from Emmas,
[21:38] saying, "Did not our hearts burn, oh
[21:41] God, that he spoke to us along the way?
[21:43] Let it be an answer to prayer we pray
[21:46] now committing all things to you in
[21:48] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[21:54] Amen. Once again, God bless you. Welcome
[21:56] you in the house of God. And happy
[21:58] Mother's Day. If you could turn around
[21:59] and welcome someone this morning. Amen.

[54:42] pray.
[54:45] Your word.
[54:48] Oh.
[54:49] [Music]
[54:56] Oh. And and
[55:00] I are you desperate for him this
[55:03] morning?
[55:04] I'm desperate for you.
[55:08] Oh Lord.
[55:14] And
[55:18] [Music]
[55:21] I want
[55:23] you, oh
[55:27] Lord, and
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:35] I I'm desperate for
[55:39] you, oh Lord.
[55:44] Oh, and I
[55:50] [Music]
[55:52] without
[55:53] [Music]
[55:55] you.
[55:57] Amen. How many can agree with that?
[56:00] Without him, we are completely lost. We
[56:04] are just uh like sheep have all gone
[56:07] astray. But we needed somebody to come
[56:09] by our way and make the difference in
[56:11] our life. And I'm so glad that I've
[56:14] received a message that can show me the
[56:17] way. And it's it's just, you know, when
[56:20] we whenever you hear us say the message,
[56:24] you know, it's we are we are recognizing
[56:27] that we have received a word from
[56:30] Malachi 4:5, the Elijah Ministry that
[56:33] has introduced us to none other Jesus
[56:36] Christ, the person himself. We are we
[56:39] are not referring to the words of a man.
[56:41] But when we say the message, I'm talking
[56:42] about Jesus Christ. I love this message.
[56:45] I love Jesus Christ. I love this word.
[56:48] And if it wasn't for Malachi 4:5, I
[56:50] wouldn't even know who he is.
[56:53] Oh. Oh. If you if you think about it,
[56:56] all of Israel, they were waiting and
[56:58] believing for a Messiah. And they knew
[57:00] they couldn't receive that Messiah
[57:03] unless Elijah came.
[57:07] That was the prophecy that Elijah would
[57:09] come to introduce the Messiah. And oh,
[57:12] God made the same promise to the
[57:14] Gentiles. He said, "I will send you
[57:17] Elijah. We have received our Elijah."
[57:21] But not only have we received our
[57:22] Elijah, he has introduced us to the
[57:25] bridegroom. Christ is here.
[57:30] We have a message.
[57:32] Why don't we go before him? Heavenly
[57:34] Father, our hearts are just overwhelmed,
[57:37] Lord, with your grace, your mercy, and
[57:40] your love, Lord. And we just want to
[57:43] thank you for our mothers who have
[57:45] nurtured us and raised us, Lord.
[57:48] that Lord, as your prophet would say,
[57:51] there there's nothing like the love of a
[57:53] mother that looks out over her children
[57:57] and she wakes thinking and goes to bed
[58:01] thinking about her
[58:03] children. Lord, we want to give them the
[58:05] honor that they
[58:07] deserve. Oh, I feel, Lord, they
[58:09] certainly work much harder than I could
[58:12] say for myself. Lord, my wife works
[58:14] harder than I do. She toils and labors
[58:17] all day. And she gets up in the midnight
[58:19] hours. And she's the one that makes it
[58:22] all come together. And when the kids are
[58:24] sick, she's the one that's up. And she's
[58:26] making a home, Lord. It would just be a
[58:28] house without her, Lord. But we thank
[58:30] you for our godly wives, Lord. And and
[58:33] our godly mothers that that look out
[58:35] over our families. Just pray a special
[58:37] blessing for them today. Lord, I thank
[58:40] you for my mom. Lord, I often think of
[58:44] that mother dear who come looking for
[58:46] that baby that was crying out for help
[58:48] and she put herself in harm's way. She
[58:50] put herself right in the line of fire
[58:53] knowing it could cost her life. My mommy
[58:56] did that for me many times, Lord. She
[58:59] went on her knees countless days and
[59:01] nights crying out, "I thank you for a
[59:05] mother like that, Lord." Lord, and it
[59:07] was her prayers that looked out over me
[59:11] and certainly had a great effect and
[59:13] impact that I could even be standing
[59:15] here this morning. Lord, we pray that
[59:17] you'd be their portion. Now, Lord, as we
[59:19] turn our hearts to the word, we just
[59:21] pray that you'd come, Father, in a
[59:22] supernatural way and break the bread of
[59:24] life to your people that they could be
[59:26] blessed. We ask it in your name, the
[59:28] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. If you
[59:30] have your Bibles, let's just turn to
[59:32] Galatians chapter 3 and we'll read a few
[59:36] verses there.
[59:38] Um, I'm just uh, you know, I I I had a I
[59:43] had a a a nice message I I that I had
[59:45] put together and I was pretty proud of
[59:47] it and uh, Brother Billy preached it
[59:50] Wednesday. So, you know, I was going to
[59:52] preach on, you know, act on your
[59:54] commission and and uh well, you know, he
[59:57] he he preached a a fantastic message and
[59:59] preached it better than I could, so I'll
[1:00:01] just preach something different. So, uh
[1:00:03] but you know, that's to me what I love
[1:00:06] about the Holy Ghost is God has a word
[1:00:09] for you and you operate the gift. So, we
[1:00:12] should have that kind of confidence
[1:00:13] regardless of what man is standing
[1:00:15] behind the pulpit that you're going to
[1:00:17] hear from God because if it's it's
[1:00:19] brother Billy's thoughts, no thought. I
[1:00:21] No, no, no offense, brother Billy. I
[1:00:22] love you, but I don't come to hear you.
[1:00:25] I I love my dad. I love our pastor and
[1:00:27] in each one, brother Andrew and and the
[1:00:29] ministers that stand here. Look, we love
[1:00:31] our brothers, but you know, if I want to
[1:00:33] hear from you, let's go have lunch,
[1:00:36] right? But when we come here to the
[1:00:38] house of God, I want to hear from him.
[1:00:39] Amen. I I want to hear from from my
[1:00:41] savior, my lord. And and God ordained
[1:00:44] the five-fold ministry to for the
[1:00:46] edifying and the perfecting
[1:00:48] of the church. Amen. So, we just pray
[1:00:50] that God would have his way in this
[1:00:51] little thought um that we have. We we we
[1:00:54] want to preach on a little thought
[1:00:55] called the pool is
[1:00:57] here. The pool is here. And as I thought
[1:01:01] about that, I was just thinking, not
[1:01:02] only is the pool here, but the pool is
[1:01:05] in you. and reading in Galatians 3:5, we
[1:01:08] may be bringing a few things together.
[1:01:09] At first, it might seem a little
[1:01:11] scattered. And if it seems scattered all
[1:01:12] the way through, we'll just look for
[1:01:14] your little piece or your little nugget.
[1:01:15] And I believe God can take one scripture
[1:01:17] or one quote. Hey, we could we could
[1:01:18] read one quote here
[1:01:21] and and be blessed. So, Galatians 3 and
[1:01:24] chapter 5, it
[1:01:25] says, are you there? Galatians
[1:01:29] 3 chapter 3 and verse 5 it says he
[1:01:32] therefore that minister to you the
[1:01:33] spirit and workketh miracles among you
[1:01:35] doth he it by works of the law or by
[1:01:38] hearing of faith even as Abraham
[1:01:41] believed God and it was accounted to him
[1:01:44] for righteousness know ye therefore that
[1:01:46] they which are of faith the same are the
[1:01:51] children of Abraham. Amen. You may be
[1:01:54] seated. If you'll also just turn over in
[1:01:56] your Bibles to John uh chapter 12 and
[1:02:00] verse
[1:02:01] 32. Like I said, it might seem like
[1:02:03] we're coming from a few different
[1:02:04] angles, but by the grace of God, we just
[1:02:06] pray that it'll come together and be a
[1:02:08] blessing to you. But uh John 12 and
[1:02:11] verse 32, but Jesus saying here, "And if
[1:02:13] I be lifted up from the earth will draw
[1:02:16] all men unto me." And brother Brandon
[1:02:18] would make a statement. He says, "If we
[1:02:20] lift up Jesus Christ up before the
[1:02:22] people, he will do the drawing. It's the
[1:02:25] greatest magnet the world has ever
[1:02:27] known, you know. And I was just kind of
[1:02:30] um uh looking into those thoughts and
[1:02:33] and about if I be lifted up and you
[1:02:35] know, I I come across brother Brandham
[1:02:37] talking about Dwight Moody and you know,
[1:02:39] he he was a mighty man of God that I
[1:02:41] believe had maybe uh it said had over
[1:02:44] 500,000 maybe to a million converts. A
[1:02:47] and you know, he was he was causing
[1:02:49] quite a stir. And so people would come
[1:02:50] out to to hear him and and one of the
[1:02:53] newspapers they decided that they wanted
[1:02:55] to maybe do a do a newspaper article and
[1:02:58] and maybe see well you know what what's
[1:03:00] all the gathering about you know and
[1:03:01] they went out there and and after they
[1:03:03] got their report they did their little
[1:03:05] write up and and they published their
[1:03:06] paper and I believe one of uh Dwight
[1:03:08] Moody's uh uh friends or managers or
[1:03:10] something got a hold of it and you know
[1:03:12] uh Dwight Moody wasn't even that
[1:03:14] educated. He couldn't even read it
[1:03:15] himself. So he had he had this brother
[1:03:18] read uh uh what they had wrote up about
[1:03:20] him and they said, "Oh, this this Dwight
[1:03:22] Moody, you know, he he's he's ugly and
[1:03:24] he he he's he's as white as he is tall
[1:03:27] and and and he snorts and he whines and
[1:03:29] he he does all of these things and at
[1:03:32] the end of the article says, "Why would
[1:03:34] anybody go out to see
[1:03:36] that?" And and Brother Brandham as he
[1:03:39] referred to the article said, you know,
[1:03:40] he said he just he just uh he just
[1:03:42] shrugged his shoulders and said
[1:03:43] shoulders and said, "Of course not." and
[1:03:45] they didn't come to to to see me. They
[1:03:47] come to see Christ.
[1:03:49] And he said, the prophet of God said,
[1:03:51] you know, that's that's just how it is.
[1:03:53] You know, Mr. Moody just shrugged his
[1:03:55] shoulders. He said, certainly not. They
[1:03:57] come to see Christ. And he said, but I
[1:03:58] think that's just the answer. It's
[1:04:01] Christ that we want to see. If I be
[1:04:03] lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me.
[1:04:07] And we know the scripture says, "All
[1:04:08] that the Father has given me will come.
[1:04:11] I will draw." Look, when Jesus said to
[1:04:13] his disciples in Matthew 4:19, "I will
[1:04:16] make you fishers of men," I want to tell
[1:04:18] you, God knows how to fish.
[1:04:22] You know, when he says, "I will make you
[1:04:23] fishers of men," God God knows how to
[1:04:25] get his fish. God knows how how to seek
[1:04:27] and to save those that are lost, he he
[1:04:30] he knows how to get you. And I want to
[1:04:32] say he when it comes to his elect, oh
[1:04:35] my, he he's the greatest fisherman. He's
[1:04:37] he's never going to lose one. He never
[1:04:39] will lose one. and and he he he he made
[1:04:42] so sure of it that he wrote your name
[1:04:43] down on the lamb's book of life before
[1:04:45] the foundation of the world. He put a
[1:04:47] little predestinated hook inside of you.
[1:04:51] That no matter how long you run, look,
[1:04:54] sometimes you can catch a pretty a
[1:04:55] pretty big fish, but if you got the
[1:04:58] right equipment,
[1:05:00] now don't take your bass pole and and
[1:05:03] your 12PB test line and go deep sea
[1:05:05] fishing, you're going to be
[1:05:07] disappointed.
[1:05:09] You will hook on to something that you
[1:05:11] cannot handle. Right?
[1:05:13] And maybe sometimes we feel like your
[1:05:15] problems and what you've gone through
[1:05:17] and and you've sinned away your day of
[1:05:19] grace. I want to tell you there ain't no
[1:05:20] problem too big for God. There's nothing
[1:05:23] you can do to send away your
[1:05:25] predestination. Now, I'm certainly not
[1:05:27] trying to do away with responsibility.
[1:05:29] We have a responsibility to this word.
[1:05:30] And when you hear the call of God, you
[1:05:32] better respond to it because if you walk
[1:05:34] away, you might walk away for your last
[1:05:36] time. But I believe there's a faith
[1:05:38] inside of the believer that when the
[1:05:40] enemy is attacking you in your mind and
[1:05:42] it's the greatest battle that's ever
[1:05:43] fought and you feel like you don't know
[1:05:45] what you're going to do and you you made
[1:05:47] another mistake. I want to tell you if
[1:05:49] there is a desire in your heart to serve
[1:05:52] God. Oh, you can have what you asked
[1:05:54] for. You have not sinned away your day
[1:05:56] of grace. You haven't made too many
[1:05:57] mistakes and failures. There's a
[1:05:59] predestinated hook on the inside of you.
[1:06:01] Want to see God has the right equipment
[1:06:03] to reel you in. Amen.
[1:06:05] You can run and you can run, but he'll
[1:06:07] just set the drag.
[1:06:10] Go ahead. Go ahead and run. Keep
[1:06:12] running. Some of you young people,
[1:06:13] you're running right now. Run through
[1:06:15] your websites. Run through your social
[1:06:17] medias. Run through your school. Run
[1:06:19] through your friends. Keep messing
[1:06:20] around with your fashions and your
[1:06:22] wardrobes and and you brothers going out
[1:06:24] there and looking at those girls and
[1:06:25] thinking you can talk to them when they
[1:06:27] haven't been born again and filled with
[1:06:28] the Holy Ghost. Shame on you. You're
[1:06:30] going to find yourself doing something
[1:06:32] you really regret. And then when you
[1:06:33] regret it, you feel like, "Well, I've
[1:06:34] regretted it. I've already sinned, so I
[1:06:36] might as well stay here a little while
[1:06:38] and enjoy the sin while I'm here. I
[1:06:40] already looked and lusted, so I might as
[1:06:41] well lust a little bit longer." Hey, I
[1:06:43] don't know why we're here, but we're
[1:06:44] here. I want to tell you, you go into
[1:06:45] that stuff, you'll get tired. You'll get
[1:06:47] rung up. Sin will take you further than
[1:06:49] you want to go. And you'll find yourself
[1:06:51] miserable, and you'll get to a place
[1:06:52] where you've done all the running you
[1:06:54] want to run. And all a sudden, you
[1:06:56] you'll come to a place you say, "All
[1:06:57] right, I'm done.
[1:06:59] All this running's made me tired."
[1:07:02] and he'll just start reeling you back
[1:07:03] in.
[1:07:05] And his line of predestination will
[1:07:07] never break.
[1:07:09] His his pull and his strength is not too
[1:07:12] weak. Lord, my God knows how to fish.
[1:07:16] And and if we don't revisit this, God
[1:07:18] wants to use you to be a fisher of men.
[1:07:21] If I could say you are his pull. I got
[1:07:25] to be careful with my Texas accent
[1:07:26] because I say pull, you know, it's a
[1:07:29] pull, a pull, a pull, not a swimming
[1:07:30] pool. And not, you know, not like a a
[1:07:33] flag pole, but a but but like you pull
[1:07:35] something, you know, you pull something.
[1:07:36] But my my wife teaches our kids, you
[1:07:38] know, and I need to say pull pull. But
[1:07:42] uh if if you get confused and for those
[1:07:44] that are interp interpreting or some of
[1:07:45] you that English is your second
[1:07:47] language, you speak it better than I.
[1:07:48] Well, I'm trying to say pool. P U L L.
[1:07:51] And God wants to use you to be a fisher
[1:07:54] of men. That's right. He said, "I will
[1:07:57] draw." You know, and that actually
[1:07:58] metaphorically is speaking about uh uh
[1:08:01] uh it also means to draw by an inward
[1:08:03] power to lead or impale. And I and
[1:08:06] that's what I'm preaching on. The pull
[1:08:08] is here. There's a pull. It means to use
[1:08:11] force in drawing or dragging or tugging.
[1:08:15] I I don't know. Have any of you ever
[1:08:17] been pulled?
[1:08:18] you know, one of my my my kids, you
[1:08:21] know, I I think when I you know, uh Evan
[1:08:23] was I think one of one of the girls just
[1:08:25] had it enough, so she started to just
[1:08:27] pull and drag Evan right out the
[1:08:30] room. Well, he come down and you know
[1:08:32] you know if you pull somebody fast
[1:08:34] enough and and hard enough cross carpet,
[1:08:36] it doesn't feel good. You know, we don't
[1:08:39] want to be pulled and dragged, but you
[1:08:40] want you want to know what? There's
[1:08:41] something pulling you.
[1:08:44] And I tell you, you know, like God said
[1:08:46] to to Paul, you it's hard to kick
[1:08:48] against the pricks.
[1:08:50] God knows how to catch his fish. And and
[1:08:52] just in ministering on this thought, the
[1:08:54] pool is here. Let's turn into Romans uh
[1:08:56] chapter 10 and we'll read a few verses
[1:09:02] here. Romans chapter
[1:09:09] 10. How many love reading your Bible?
[1:09:13] I say, "Lord, help me fall more in love
[1:09:16] with your written word." If you don't
[1:09:18] see Jesus Christ in every line, read it
[1:09:21] again. And uh that's quite the challenge
[1:09:24] because there's some places you're like,
[1:09:27] but it's all the inspired written word
[1:09:30] of God. And there's many times you find
[1:09:32] out in a quote, "Oh, we bypass so much,
[1:09:35] church.
[1:09:37] We bypass so much." You know, I would
[1:09:39] encourage you, you know, I understand
[1:09:42] sometimes when you're trying to find a
[1:09:43] find maybe maybe a text or initial
[1:09:46] thought, but oh, oh, the the the
[1:09:48] prophet, he'll lay so much in before he
[1:09:51] even before he even takes his text. I
[1:09:55] was at some meetings and a brother was
[1:09:57] preaching and and he he got to talking
[1:09:59] about some of the men that want to
[1:10:00] explain the message and he said, "These
[1:10:03] guys that want to explain the message,
[1:10:04] the prophet will make say more in a
[1:10:06] prayer than he will in his whole
[1:10:07] ministry." I said, "Hey, glory to God.
[1:10:10] That was pretty good." Cuz I tell you
[1:10:11] what, if anybody knew how to pray, our
[1:10:13] prophet knew how to pray. Oh my.
[1:10:15] Sometimes you want to learn how to pray.
[1:10:16] Listen to the prophet pray.
[1:10:19] You know, these things are here to teach
[1:10:21] us and to instruct us and and you can go
[1:10:24] in and hear how he approaches and oh,
[1:10:25] it'll do you a great bit of good. I
[1:10:27] mean, we got to we got to quit
[1:10:28] approaching the message academically.
[1:10:31] And when you when that turns on,
[1:10:32] understand this is a vindicated prophet
[1:10:34] of God. and just the way he starts to
[1:10:35] approach the sermon and he's getting
[1:10:37] himself out of the way and he let those
[1:10:39] stories he's telling in the beginning
[1:10:41] that's not just little stories to to get
[1:10:44] his nerves out of the way. Some of them
[1:10:45] are but you know what's happening? It's
[1:10:47] God speaking through a man and he's
[1:10:50] telling little stories because he's
[1:10:51] setting the stage for the word he wants
[1:10:53] to bring. And you'll find out as you go
[1:10:55] through that message, you're like, "Oh,
[1:10:56] that that's what happened to so- and so
[1:10:57] and that's what happened to soand so."
[1:10:59] So, uh let's just read this scripture.
[1:11:00] Therefore, whosoever shall come call
[1:11:02] upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:11:06] saved. Has anybody experienced that?
[1:11:10] You know, that's my testimony. I called
[1:11:12] upon the name of the Lord and I was
[1:11:13] saved. How then shall they call on him
[1:11:15] in whom they have not believed? And how
[1:11:17] shall they believe in him of whom they
[1:11:19] have not heard? And how shall they hear
[1:11:21] without a preacher? And how shall they
[1:11:23] preach except they be sent? As it is
[1:11:26] written, how beautiful are the feet of
[1:11:27] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:11:30] bring glad tidings of good things. But
[1:11:33] they have not all obeyed the gospel. For
[1:11:35] Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed, I
[1:11:38] report? So then faith cometh by
[1:11:42] hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
[1:11:45] So if you're ever going to receive
[1:11:47] faith,
[1:11:48] it's going to come by the hearing of the
[1:11:51] word. Now, we understand that that seed
[1:11:53] was already placed inside of you, that
[1:11:55] receptor. Just like right now, there's
[1:11:57] radio waves going through the the the
[1:11:59] room. There's there's TV waves and all
[1:12:01] of those things. And the only way you
[1:12:02] can pick that up is if you have that
[1:12:04] crystal or that receptor to receive it
[1:12:07] and that seed is laying there. And when
[1:12:09] you hear the word of God, it's quickened
[1:12:11] and brought to life. Now, we just want
[1:12:13] to start working through some of our
[1:12:15] inspiration here uh uh that we are
[1:12:17] getting out of why Christ speak. The
[1:12:19] prophet of God would say this. Moses
[1:12:21] being born with this great gift of
[1:12:23] faith. Then he was anointed and
[1:12:25] commissioned at the burning bush to
[1:12:28] deliver God's people. Now see what great
[1:12:30] qualities this man had. He he was born
[1:12:32] for a certain thing. God had purposed
[1:12:35] it. God has a purpose of you being here.
[1:12:38] See if you can only be just get to a
[1:12:40] place how much trouble you'll save God
[1:12:43] and yourself too. Oh my goodness. I
[1:12:46] could have saved God and myself a whole
[1:12:49] lot of trouble when I was 12, 13 years
[1:12:51] old when he had a call on my life and
[1:12:54] I'd had a great wonderful experience.
[1:12:55] But you know what I did? I ended up
[1:12:57] going out in the world for for a good
[1:12:59] five, six years and I could have saved
[1:13:01] myself a whole lot of trouble. You say,
[1:13:03] "Well, brother Matthew, that's part of
[1:13:04] your testimony." Yeah, it's part of my
[1:13:06] testimony, but it wasn't God's perfect
[1:13:08] will. You're never going to tell me that
[1:13:10] his perfect will was for me to go out in
[1:13:12] the world and sin and live a live a
[1:13:13] sinful life just so I could testify. But
[1:13:15] his grace and his mercy can take the per
[1:13:18] permissive and work it right back into
[1:13:21] his perfect where he can take your
[1:13:23] testimony and be a perfect testimony
[1:13:25] unto the people of what God's grace will
[1:13:27] do in an individual's life. You'll save
[1:13:30] yourself and God a whole lot of trouble.
[1:13:31] He goes on to say Moses born and then he
[1:13:34] was afterwards he was brought to the
[1:13:37] place where he was anointed.
[1:13:40] Now, now I want you to see yourself in
[1:13:42] this because he said we were all born
[1:13:44] for a purpose. Moses was born for a
[1:13:46] purpose, but he had to come to a place
[1:13:48] where he was anointed. And notice this
[1:13:50] the seed laying there with an
[1:13:53] intellectual conception
[1:13:55] with all the faith that he was born to
[1:13:58] deliver this people. And yet it never
[1:14:01] come to life until that light from the
[1:14:03] burning bush flashed across it. until he
[1:14:07] seen not something he read about but
[1:14:10] something he seen with his eyes
[1:14:13] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:14:16] back to it. Oh, how that did bring
[1:14:20] things to life. I say that's the kind of
[1:14:22] God I want to serve. I want to serve a
[1:14:24] God that I can speak and it speaks back.
[1:14:26] Amen.
[1:14:27] And I think a man or a woman or boy or
[1:14:30] girl and I think in in an intellectual
[1:14:34] conception of what they think the word
[1:14:38] is an intellectual conception of what
[1:14:41] you think the message is.
[1:14:45] Are you following me?
[1:14:48] and so forth can never have a full
[1:14:51] foundation stand until they have met
[1:14:54] that light that brings that word to
[1:14:58] reality.
[1:15:01] Do not sell yourself short. Every single
[1:15:04] one of us needs a burning bush
[1:15:06] experience. Every single one of us has a
[1:15:10] right to go to the pillar of fire to the
[1:15:12] burning bush. Well, you say, "What do
[1:15:15] you mean you have a right?" Because
[1:15:16] Jesus Christ paid for that, right? He he
[1:15:19] he went to Calvary and he laid down his
[1:15:21] life and he shed his own blood that you
[1:15:23] could be brought back into fellowship
[1:15:25] again. When when Adam sin, he broke the
[1:15:28] fellowship. But Christ has come, the
[1:15:30] second Adam to restore fellowship back
[1:15:33] again.
[1:15:36] That you by faith can hear the word.
[1:15:39] And you can say, "Look, if I if Lord, I
[1:15:42] if you're saying that I got to have a
[1:15:43] burning bush experience, if I got to
[1:15:45] meet you on the back side of the desert,
[1:15:47] if I can meet you face to face, then
[1:15:50] Lord, that's what I want." I think some
[1:15:51] of us just need to get in desperation
[1:15:54] where it's no longer a story that you
[1:15:56] just don't have an intellectual
[1:15:57] conception. Look, Moses had an
[1:16:00] intellectual conception that he was the
[1:16:02] deliverer of God's people. His mama
[1:16:05] raised him, right? His mama said, "You
[1:16:07] were born of a peculiar birth." She told
[1:16:09] him how he hid you and floated you down
[1:16:10] the river and God protected you and he
[1:16:12] raised you up in Pharaoh's house. Look,
[1:16:15] Moses knew he was born for a purpose.
[1:16:17] And many of us, we know intellectually,
[1:16:20] we know there's something in our heart
[1:16:21] that we are born for a purpose. But it
[1:16:23] wouldn't do Moses any good until he met
[1:16:26] that light.
[1:16:29] Now, I just might be oldfashioned, but
[1:16:31] I'm going to keep preaching an
[1:16:32] oldfashioned Pentecostal experience. I
[1:16:35] believe that's what our God, that's what
[1:16:37] our prophet preached. He said, "Look,
[1:16:39] I'm restoring you back to the original
[1:16:41] faith of the Pentecostal fathers." When
[1:16:43] they were gathered in an upper room and
[1:16:45] there came a sound like a mighty mighty
[1:16:48] wind that filled them and endued them
[1:16:50] with power on high, that same God is
[1:16:52] here this morning to fill you with the
[1:16:54] power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:57] Hallelujah.
[1:16:59] But you get we get so bound
[1:17:01] intellectually
[1:17:02] where we're just happy with an
[1:17:05] understanding of the message. We're just
[1:17:07] happy with an understanding of what God
[1:17:09] said. Look, I want more than an
[1:17:12] understanding. I need the life of this
[1:17:15] message. I need the God of this message.
[1:17:17] I need the power of this message. I need
[1:17:19] the Holy Ghost of this message. cuz my
[1:17:22] mind will fail me when this quote won't
[1:17:24] fit with that quote and and what this
[1:17:26] guy said and that one said and my mind
[1:17:28] don't understand it. Oh, I got an anchor
[1:17:30] down in here that I know what I'm
[1:17:32] talking about. That I have met Jesus
[1:17:34] Christ. I have been on the back side of
[1:17:36] the desert. I have met that light and
[1:17:38] that light changed me and quickened the
[1:17:41] predestinated sea that shut up in my
[1:17:43] bones. Oh, you can sit on it. But I want
[1:17:46] to tell you there is an experience for
[1:17:48] the believer this morning. Thank you,
[1:17:49] Lord.
[1:17:51] Hallelujah. Let's just hear what a
[1:17:52] prophet
[1:17:54] said. He said, "I think no church in its
[1:17:57] practice, no matter how intellectual and
[1:18:00] fundamentally it right, it might
[1:18:02] be." All right, we're coming home.
[1:18:12] Oh, there's a there's a there's a lot of
[1:18:13] a lot of churches and a lot of us and
[1:18:16] myself, if we're not careful, I think no
[1:18:19] church in its practice, no matter how
[1:18:21] intellectual and fundamentally it might
[1:18:23] be, that church cannot thrive until the
[1:18:27] supernatural is made known among the
[1:18:30] people and they see it. something they
[1:18:33] can talk to that will talk back to them
[1:18:37] that vindicates this written word. Now,
[1:18:39] I don't know about you, but you ought to
[1:18:40] take that personal right now and say,
[1:18:42] "God, I see a vindicated prophet telling
[1:18:45] me that a church cannot thrive until the
[1:18:47] supernatural is made known among that
[1:18:49] people." Look, I want to bring it down
[1:18:51] to I know we see the supernatural and
[1:18:53] many of us have experienced, but I'm
[1:18:55] talking about an individual now coming
[1:18:57] to the place and saying hh and they see
[1:18:59] it something that they the individual
[1:19:04] can talk to
[1:19:06] and it talked back to them. I want to
[1:19:08] tell you if you've never talked to God,
[1:19:10] if you've never took the word, if you've
[1:19:12] never took the message and it speak back
[1:19:14] to you, you say, "Brother Matthew, I've
[1:19:16] never heard an audio board. I'm talking
[1:19:18] about something in your soul that is so
[1:19:20] far beyond the five senses of your flesh
[1:19:23] that something has anchored within your
[1:19:25] soul that when your mind will fail you,
[1:19:27] your thoughts will fail you, your five
[1:19:28] senses will fail you, your family will
[1:19:30] fail you, your church will fail you. But
[1:19:32] there has come an anchor inside of your
[1:19:34] soul that you know that this message is
[1:19:36] right. And if everybody else walks away,
[1:19:39] I have heard a message. I have believed.
[1:19:41] I have spoke to God and the message has
[1:19:44] spoken back. I have heard from God.
[1:19:50] He said in Luke 18, Jesus said, "When
[1:19:52] the Son of Man cometh, shall he find
[1:19:54] faith in the earth." Now, the prophet of
[1:19:57] God would pick this up and he would,
[1:19:58] Brother Brandon would tie Luke 18, "Will
[1:20:01] I find faith in all the earth?" And he
[1:20:03] would tie that together with Revelations
[1:20:05] 10:7, "In the days of the message of the
[1:20:07] seventh angel, the mysteries of God
[1:20:09] ought to be finished." Will I find
[1:20:11] faith?
[1:20:13] We're speaking on faith for a little
[1:20:15] bit. Not just any kind of
[1:20:18] faith. Not just a denominational faith,
[1:20:21] not a partial faith, but I want to say
[1:20:24] the faith of this hour
[1:20:27] for this has to be rapturing faith.
[1:20:32] And I I just want to speak it on that. I
[1:20:34] I was just when that struck my heart
[1:20:36] about rapturing faith, I it reminded me
[1:20:38] of a quote that I want to read to you
[1:20:40] where brother Brandon was talking about
[1:20:42] how the the the church lady, they're
[1:20:44] blind, miserable, wretched, naked, and
[1:20:47] and they don't know it and and they just
[1:20:49] trample over the things of God. I I
[1:20:51] think it's astounding to me, but you
[1:20:53] know, we we understand that Malachi 4:5
[1:20:56] was the ministry of Jesus Christ to the
[1:20:58] Gentiles. It it was the exact same
[1:21:00] thing. It was it was I I don't know how
[1:21:02] else to say it, but you look back and
[1:21:03] see here was Jesus opening the blind
[1:21:06] eyes and and deaf ears coming open. A
[1:21:09] and I I'll never I love the story how
[1:21:11] they said to Jesus like who is this man
[1:21:13] that can forgive sin? He says well let
[1:21:14] me ask you a question. Is it harder for
[1:21:17] me to say thy sins are forgiven or take
[1:21:19] up thy bed and walk? And he spoke to
[1:21:21] that man. He said take up your bed and
[1:21:23] walk. What what was it? It was God
[1:21:26] failing himself. It was God in man.
[1:21:30] All they could see is this not the son
[1:21:32] of Joseph. Is this not the son of Mary?
[1:21:34] Alls they could do is contact the
[1:21:36] natural but oh there was a predestinated
[1:21:39] people there when he p I don't know how
[1:21:41] many people Jesus said follow me.
[1:21:45] It's not recorded in there but alls I
[1:21:47] know that he came by Peter and John.
[1:21:50] Look this message has called a lot of
[1:21:52] people. I want to say the son of man has
[1:21:54] been lifted up. He says if I be lifted
[1:21:56] up I will draw all men unto me. Look, I
[1:21:59] don't know how many fishermen he walked
[1:22:00] by and said, "Follow me." But I know
[1:22:03] there was two that had a predestinated
[1:22:05] seed inside of them. And when that
[1:22:07] message said, "Come and follow me." They
[1:22:10] looked out there in fishing nets. They
[1:22:11] looked at their boat. They looked at
[1:22:13] their father said, "Something's calling.
[1:22:16] Something's trling. I got to go. I got
[1:22:19] to follow. I got to leave my job. I got
[1:22:21] to leave my career. I have to follow
[1:22:23] after the word." I want to say the
[1:22:25] message should do the same thing in you.
[1:22:27] Amen.
[1:22:31] And the Sadducees and Pharisees, they
[1:22:32] just sat
[1:22:34] around and just wanted to to bicker and
[1:22:37] wanted to condemn and and what said,
[1:22:38] "Well, this is of Elseub." They couldn't
[1:22:41] receive it.
[1:22:43] You know how that the the the you know,
[1:22:45] they asked him, "Lord, you know, why why
[1:22:47] is
[1:22:47] this why was this man blind? Is because
[1:22:50] of his parents' sin, his sin? Who why is
[1:22:53] it this way?" He said, "Neither that God
[1:22:55] would get the glory.
[1:22:58] that the son of man should be
[1:23:00] glorified and that God performed the,
[1:23:02] you know, a supernatural work on him.
[1:23:05] And remember, he had to be obedient,
[1:23:07] too. He He made the spittle in clay and
[1:23:09] he put his now go wash. You got, you
[1:23:11] wonder why you don't get the results of
[1:23:12] the word. You haven't been obedient to
[1:23:14] the word. You're still staging around in
[1:23:16] sanctification and you haven't given up
[1:23:18] certain habits and certain things and
[1:23:19] you wonder why you're struggling. Well,
[1:23:21] lay them down. Be obedient to the word.
[1:23:22] Take God in his word. Apply the token.
[1:23:25] Clean up your house. Listen, if you find
[1:23:26] yourself failing again, call on the name
[1:23:28] of the Lord. Say, "Lord, come back. I I
[1:23:30] somehow got weak. I entertained the
[1:23:31] thought again, Lord, but but I want to
[1:23:33] be sanctified. I want to be filled." And
[1:23:34] you you go back to the first works. You
[1:23:36] do your repentance.
[1:23:38] But you wonder why you're you're you're
[1:23:39] not seeing things. Look, the prophet
[1:23:41] labored there. You wonder why you ain't
[1:23:42] seeing certain blessings your life when
[1:23:44] he when he stood there before those
[1:23:46] Pentecostal people and said, "How can I
[1:23:48] teach them algebra when they won't even
[1:23:50] learn their
[1:23:51] ABCs?" I I think it's a strange thing.
[1:23:54] Have we come to a place in this message
[1:23:56] where we're fighting and bickering about
[1:23:57] our ABCs? We don't know how to dress. We
[1:24:00] don't know how to act. We don't know how
[1:24:01] to wear our hair. We we're we're
[1:24:03] confused about emotions at work. Are you
[1:24:06] kidding me? This is a mature bride. This
[1:24:08] is a mature lady. We are so much further
[1:24:11] down the road. We are crossing over. We
[1:24:14] have received our Joshua ministry that
[1:24:17] has taken us into the promised land. We
[1:24:19] are possessing our inheritance.
[1:24:23] That's the truth. I I ain't no confused
[1:24:25] Pentecostal from 50, 60 years ago. So if
[1:24:28] you see me screaming, shouting, and
[1:24:30] dancing, look, I ain't trying to work up
[1:24:32] some feeling. I ain't trying to go back
[1:24:33] to some dead formal religion. No, I'm
[1:24:36] rejoicing in the presence of the S. Soom
[1:24:39] because I have received my Messiah. The
[1:24:41] capstone has come and crying, grace,
[1:24:44] grace, grace. And I am living in the
[1:24:47] presence of the son.
[1:24:50] Boy, I love this message.
[1:24:53] Hallelujah.
[1:24:55] I love this word. I love calling me a
[1:24:57] fanatic. Yes, I am a fanatic. I was a
[1:25:00] fanatic when I was out there in the
[1:25:02] world, so I might as well be a fanatic
[1:25:03] for God.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:14] Every They were just all trampling over
[1:25:15] him just like the Sadducees and
[1:25:18] Pharisees did.
[1:25:20] They they just trampled right over the
[1:25:21] things of God. Called it be elabub. And
[1:25:23] what happened? God come to the Gentiles
[1:25:26] according to divine promise. And here
[1:25:28] was the ministry of the son of man on a
[1:25:30] display again. And what did they do?
[1:25:33] They called it
[1:25:35] Beelzeba. But you know what? He came for
[1:25:38] the elect. He came for the
[1:25:40] predestinated. You know when brother
[1:25:41] Brandon mentions the third pool, we know
[1:25:43] the third pool is revealing Christ.
[1:25:44] That's what we want to get to. And that
[1:25:46] the pool is here. The third pool is
[1:25:48] here. It's Christ. It was the revealing
[1:25:50] of the son of man. A and and and we know
[1:25:52] that the third pulled us to the totally
[1:25:55] lost. I'm Come on. Are y'all studying
[1:25:57] the message? I I I look, I I want to
[1:26:00] promise you one thing. I'm only going to
[1:26:02] say what the prophet said. I'm only
[1:26:03] going to say what the Bible said. And
[1:26:05] and so if if I say something that the
[1:26:07] prophet didn't say, please come to me
[1:26:09] because I want to be right. But I just
[1:26:11] want to say I I hope that we can be
[1:26:13] relaxed and we can just enjoy the word
[1:26:15] of God. And brother Matthew's not trying
[1:26:17] to take you anywhere that that the
[1:26:19] prophet didn't take you. I got no voice
[1:26:22] of my own. Look, I my prophet told me I
[1:26:24] ain't got no thought coming. So if you
[1:26:26] want to know what I'm thinking about, I
[1:26:27] want to think about the message. You
[1:26:29] want to know what I'm talking about? I
[1:26:30] want to talk about the message. You want
[1:26:32] to know what I'm feeding on? I'm feeding
[1:26:33] on the message. I ain't studying Billy
[1:26:35] Graham's message. I ain't studying Oral
[1:26:37] Roberts message. I ain't going back into
[1:26:39] history books and finding out what this
[1:26:40] one said and that one said. I only have
[1:26:43] one desire in my heart. I want to know
[1:26:44] what Malachi 4:5 said because it was
[1:26:47] Malachi 4 that was commissioned to
[1:26:50] introduce me to my Messiah. And when I
[1:26:52] feed on that word, I'm feeding on the
[1:26:54] body word of the son of man. I am
[1:26:56] feeding on my Messiah.
[1:26:59] I have received the message.
[1:27:04] And that's why I'm worked up. That's why
[1:27:06] I'm happy. Because while the church
[1:27:08] world out there is looking for a Messiah
[1:27:11] to come, I have heard a shout.
[1:27:14] I have heard a message that said,
[1:27:16] "Behold the lamb of God. Christ is
[1:27:20] here."
[1:27:23] Amen.
[1:27:24] Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] I love this message. I love this word. I
[1:27:36] want to I want to eat it, drink it,
[1:27:38] breathe it.
[1:27:41] It's more than life to me. I've tried
[1:27:43] the things of the world and they failed
[1:27:46] me. I tried what lady OC I had to offer
[1:27:49] and it failed me. But my God has never
[1:27:52] failed me one time.
[1:27:57] That ought to get a bigger amen in a
[1:27:59] church with over 400 people in it. Are
[1:28:01] you kidding me?
[1:28:07] Help us, Lord Jesus.
[1:28:10] I say Christ is here.
[1:28:13] He has never failed you.
[1:28:16] I said he has never failed you.
[1:28:20] I said maybe what we need to start doing
[1:28:22] is doing a little tallying up. Did he
[1:28:26] fail you when you were a kid?
[1:28:29] Did he fail you when you were four or
[1:28:30] five? Did he fail you when you were a
[1:28:33] teenager? Did he fail you when you were
[1:28:35] sick? Did he fail you when you needed
[1:28:37] the Holy Ghost?
[1:28:40] Hallelujah. I said, "Has he ever failed
[1:28:42] you?" He's never failed you. And I want
[1:28:45] to tell you, if he's given you a
[1:28:46] promise, you keep standing on that
[1:28:48] promise, cuz my God will never fail you.
[1:28:59] Christ come for the elected.
[1:29:03] The prophet of God says this.
[1:29:06] He says in the rapture, just jumping out
[1:29:09] into this
[1:29:10] quote, he says, we brother Brandon was
[1:29:13] talking about
[1:29:14] how Lady O and all them just trample
[1:29:17] right over the things of God. But he
[1:29:19] says, but to the church, the bride, the
[1:29:22] rapture is a revelation to her.
[1:29:27] It ain't no public show.
[1:29:30] It's a revelation.
[1:29:33] Hey, some of y'all are looking for the
[1:29:35] rapture. I'm crazy enough to let you
[1:29:37] know it's here. I'm living in it. Look,
[1:29:41] look, look. While while the world is
[1:29:43] looking for an event, just like Mary
[1:29:46] said, Lord, I know
[1:29:50] at the resurrection, my brother will
[1:29:52] rise.
[1:29:53] I know. Oh, hallelujah. He what did he
[1:29:56] tell her? He said, he said, Mary, the
[1:29:58] resurrection is not just an event.
[1:30:02] He said the resurre I am the
[1:30:04] resurrection. Oh, what a resurrection
[1:30:06] that was. And what a resurrection this
[1:30:09] is. The quickening power lets us see his
[1:30:12] qu his his coming. His quickening power
[1:30:15] lets us see him revealed in the word.
[1:30:20] While the church world is waiting for
[1:30:22] airplanes to fall out of the sky.
[1:30:26] While the church world is waiting for
[1:30:28] some event,
[1:30:30] they have missed the advent of the
[1:30:33] prophet messenger of Malachi 4:5 saying,
[1:30:37] "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:30:42] And I think it's amazing in the
[1:30:43] scripture. What do you find just a
[1:30:45] chapter later? The disciples of John are
[1:30:48] coming to Jesus.
[1:30:50] Why in the world does discip John still
[1:30:53] have disciples? because they never
[1:30:55] caught the revelation. They never caught
[1:30:58] the third pole. They never caught that
[1:31:00] John was introducing the son of man.
[1:31:04] And that's why today we still have
[1:31:07] disciples of with brother Brandham. But
[1:31:09] they have never caught the opening of
[1:31:11] the word that he came. He said, "Oh, I
[1:31:13] must decrease. You might see some
[1:31:15] strange things. A stepping back."
[1:31:20] Oh, just like John the
[1:31:21] Baptist. He said, "Brother Randerson
[1:31:24] said, I must continue on in evangelism
[1:31:26] like I was first commissioned." Is that
[1:31:27] what he said?
[1:31:30] Well, what did John do? He continued
[1:31:34] on baptizing at the Ohio River. I mean,
[1:31:38] the Jordan River, right?
[1:31:42] But he had already fi fulfilled the
[1:31:43] commission.
[1:31:45] He had already introduced. And there was
[1:31:48] two standing there. I believe it was
[1:31:49] Andrew and another one. They were they
[1:31:51] were disciples of John. They were
[1:31:53] listening to the message. They loved the
[1:31:55] third pool. They loved the second pool.
[1:31:58] They said this here, oh, you know, I'm
[1:32:00] dramatizing here. You know, they're
[1:32:01] they're seeing a prophetic ministry.
[1:32:04] They loved all these things. But when it
[1:32:06] came to his message,
[1:32:09] behold the lamb of God. They they they
[1:32:13] they what did they do? They followed
[1:32:16] what the prophet was introducing. Now,
[1:32:18] don't get any idea in your head that you
[1:32:20] can leave this message, you leave this
[1:32:21] message, you leave the word. You leave
[1:32:24] Malachi 4:5, you leave the word. You
[1:32:26] want to try try to say, "Oh, he
[1:32:27] introduced the message in 63 and so the
[1:32:30] things before." I'm sorry. Hold on. You
[1:32:32] got the wrong guy here. I'm going to
[1:32:34] believe Genesis to Revelations and I
[1:32:36] will believe everything that's on tape
[1:32:38] from that vindicated prophet because I
[1:32:39] believe it was the very voice of God to
[1:32:41] me by faith. I know that I know there's
[1:32:45] a portion laying in there that's a man,
[1:32:47] but God allows it to be that way because
[1:32:48] it'll stumble some people and they'll
[1:32:50] fall away. But I can look past the veil
[1:32:54] because I have a revelation. I am not
[1:32:57] looking at a man. Other people come into
[1:32:59] this church, they look up there and they
[1:33:01] see a man, but somebody that got a
[1:33:03] revelation. I'm not looking at a man.
[1:33:06] I'm looking past the veil. I see the
[1:33:08] shakina glory. I see the logos. I see
[1:33:11] the same pillar of fire. I see the same
[1:33:13] cloud that was leading the children of
[1:33:14] Israel by day and by night. I see him.
[1:33:22] I don't see a man.
[1:33:27] We're well taught in these things.
[1:33:30] The rapture is a revelation.
[1:33:34] It's revealed to
[1:33:36] her that the revelation, the true bride
[1:33:39] of Christ will be waiting for the
[1:33:41] revelation of the rapture. Now, it is a
[1:33:44] revelation for the revelation is faith.
[1:33:47] You cannot have a revelation without it
[1:33:49] being faith. Faith is a revelation
[1:33:52] because it's something that's revealed
[1:33:53] to you. Faith is a revelation. Faith is
[1:33:56] something that has been revealed to you
[1:33:58] like it was to Abraham that could call
[1:34:01] anything contrary to what had been
[1:34:03] revealed to him as though it wasn't. So
[1:34:06] now faith that's what faith is. It's a
[1:34:13] revelation is a the revelation of God.
[1:34:16] The church is built upon a revelation.
[1:34:21] The whole entire body Amen.
[1:34:26] The message of the hour will produce a
[1:34:28] faith to meet the challenge of the age.
[1:34:32] I I don't care how bad it looks and how
[1:34:35] much darkness and sin is heaping up
[1:34:39] around you and it just looks like you're
[1:34:41] not going to be able to make you make
[1:34:43] it. I want to tell you that the message
[1:34:45] will produce a faith in you to meet the
[1:34:48] challenge of the age. And I want to tell
[1:34:50] you, you can't just sit around and
[1:34:52] wonder and hide yourself in a closet and
[1:34:55] think, "Oh, the darkness will pass
[1:34:57] sometimes." I don't want to talk about
[1:34:59] the message. I don't want to go out
[1:35:01] there. Look what we're talking about. If
[1:35:02] I the if I the son of man be lifted up,
[1:35:05] how's he going to be lifted up?
[1:35:09] Now, we know we know in one type he was
[1:35:11] lifted up and ascended on high, but he
[1:35:13] said, "Look, I got to go away that I
[1:35:14] might send a comforter that I might come
[1:35:17] to you." So now what is he? All that was
[1:35:19] in God, he poured into Christ. And all
[1:35:21] that was in Christ, he poured into you,
[1:35:23] the believer. So where is Christ now?
[1:35:25] He's in you. So how is the world going
[1:35:28] to see Christ? They got to see you.
[1:35:32] You can't just be not telling anybody.
[1:35:34] Reminds me of that boy. You know, the
[1:35:36] mama told the boys like, "You know, son,
[1:35:37] now you know when you go up there to
[1:35:38] that camp, they're going to find out
[1:35:40] that you're a Christian and they're
[1:35:41] really going to give you a hard time.
[1:35:44] You might lose your job. you know,
[1:35:45] something might happen to you when they
[1:35:47] find out what you believe because, you
[1:35:49] know, they can really make it rough on
[1:35:50] you. He said, "Okay, mama, no problem."
[1:35:53] So, he went out there maybe four or five
[1:35:55] days and he he got back and he said,
[1:35:57] "Son, I was praying for you the whole
[1:36:00] time. I knew they were going to give you
[1:36:01] a real rough time when they found out
[1:36:03] you were a Christian. How did everything
[1:36:05] go?" He said, "Oh, mom, it went great."
[1:36:07] She says, "Really? What happened?" He
[1:36:09] goes, "They never found out."
[1:36:14] We laugh about it, but does your
[1:36:15] neighbor know?
[1:36:17] Does your coworker that you've been
[1:36:18] sitting to for 10 years know what you
[1:36:20] believe?
[1:36:23] You went to high school? You went to
[1:36:26] junior high and you're telling me the
[1:36:28] people you call your friends?
[1:36:31] Don't even know about Malachi 4:5. Come
[1:36:34] on.
[1:36:37] I question whether they're your friend
[1:36:39] or not.
[1:36:45] I'm sorry. This message is the greatest
[1:36:48] thing the planet has ever witnessed.
[1:36:53] Let's just
[1:36:54] say let's just say a spoonful of ocean
[1:36:59] water. I don't know what that would do
[1:37:01] to the economy. So that people that are
[1:37:03] smart don't go don't get that
[1:37:05] far. But we know it's the gospel or a
[1:37:07] gospel. Let's look at it that way. If a
[1:37:09] spoon let's look at it from a health
[1:37:10] perspective because I was about to say
[1:37:11] if it was money that'd be weird. But
[1:37:13] let's say a spoonful of ocean water
[1:37:15] could heal
[1:37:17] you. And you're packing around a a
[1:37:19] spoonful of ocean water and you're
[1:37:21] saying, "Well, I might need this
[1:37:23] someday. I'll keep it for myself."
[1:37:25] And you got friends and co-workers and
[1:37:27] people that need a spoonful of ocean
[1:37:29] water and you're afraid to give it out
[1:37:31] because you might run
[1:37:33] out. Brother Brandham talks about I
[1:37:35] believe about could you imagine a mouse
[1:37:37] on the grain silos of Egypt eating
[1:37:39] sparingly.
[1:37:41] Friends, you can never exhaust the
[1:37:43] message and it's the greatest thing that
[1:37:44] ever hit the planet. You got to tell
[1:37:46] your friends. You got to tell your
[1:37:48] co-workers. You got to tell your family.
[1:37:50] What happens if they ridicule me? Well,
[1:37:52] what happens if I lose my job?
[1:37:56] God got your back.
[1:37:59] What were you dependent on in the first
[1:38:01] place?
[1:38:03] Are you dependent on your job or are you
[1:38:05] dependent on God? Are you dependent on
[1:38:07] your paycheck? Are you dependent on his
[1:38:10] word? I say, what are you depending on?
[1:38:15] Oh, it's a revelation.
[1:38:18] And I say, you got to act on it.
[1:38:22] Noah received the word of God. Then what
[1:38:24] did he have to
[1:38:25] do? He had to act on it. The prophet of
[1:38:28] God said he had to act on that word and
[1:38:30] then he would see the miracle. Some of
[1:38:31] us, we've believed the message. We
[1:38:33] received the message, but you haven't
[1:38:34] acted on it. I say it's time you start
[1:38:37] acting on it and taking God at his word.
[1:38:40] Noah moved by faith for the building of
[1:38:43] the ark, for the salvation of his
[1:38:45] family. I just want to say this because
[1:38:49] revelation affects the way you act.
[1:38:53] It affects the way that you think. It
[1:38:57] affects the way that you dress. Amen. It
[1:39:01] affects the way that you plan.
[1:39:04] It It starts to have an effect on your
[1:39:06] life and the friends that you have and
[1:39:09] the certain jobs that you are take. It
[1:39:10] affects your schedule because somebody
[1:39:12] who was born again and filled with the
[1:39:14] Holy Ghost, they would make sure they
[1:39:15] were in the house of God when the doors
[1:39:17] are open. And they would make sure to
[1:39:19] put the word of God first. They would do
[1:39:21] everything within their power to stand
[1:39:22] for truth. And you say, "Well, you know
[1:39:24] what? I I esteem God's word greater than
[1:39:27] what Lady Oia has to offer. If I lose my
[1:39:30] job standing for this message, I say,
[1:39:33] "Let me lose my job." But at least I
[1:39:36] stood for truth.
[1:39:39] But we're so bound by fear and Lady Oia
[1:39:43] under such a pressure. You think Lady
[1:39:45] Oia is providing your needs? God's
[1:39:47] providing your needs.
[1:39:52] revelation starts to affect the way you
[1:39:54] act.
[1:39:57] Just like a
[1:39:58] a a lady with child, you know, it starts
[1:40:01] to affect
[1:40:03] her. You know, all of a sudden she
[1:40:06] doesn't eat the same thing she used to
[1:40:09] eat. Her diet starts to change. it
[1:40:13] starts to affect the way she plans and
[1:40:15] and and oh that that anniversary trip we
[1:40:19] were going to go on. Even though it was
[1:40:21] paid for, even though you you you had
[1:40:23] the airplane paid for and and you had
[1:40:25] the the hotel paid for and everything
[1:40:28] was paid for, there's something else
[1:40:30] that's taken a greater preeminence in
[1:40:32] their
[1:40:33] life. I don't care if it's paid for. I I
[1:40:36] don't care how wonderful the trip was
[1:40:38] going to be. Something's happening to
[1:40:40] me.
[1:40:41] I'm being changed and it gets to such a
[1:40:43] place where they can't hide it anymore.
[1:40:50] Come on. It gets to such a place where
[1:40:52] they can't even hide it anymore. Their
[1:40:54] their whole life and existence is
[1:40:55] declaring I'm going to have a baby. It
[1:40:59] becomes the the predominant factor in
[1:41:01] their mind what they're thinking about.
[1:41:04] You know, so much so it reminds me I I
[1:41:07] uh I was at some meetings. I went up to
[1:41:09] a couple
[1:41:10] And uh I said, "Well, you know what?
[1:41:13] Another one in the
[1:41:15] books." She said, "Yeah, yep. Number
[1:41:18] two, it's going to be a girl."
[1:41:20] Oh. Oh, sister. I'm I'm sorry. I I I
[1:41:23] would have been more gracious. I I was
[1:41:25] talking about the
[1:41:28] meetings. But you see what was on her
[1:41:30] mind? See, her life was declaring, "I'm
[1:41:33] going to have a baby." And because what
[1:41:35] her life was declaring, people are
[1:41:36] asking, "So, what's it going to be?
[1:41:38] When's the due date? When's this? was
[1:41:40] that. So every all of her conversation
[1:41:42] and the very thing that people are
[1:41:44] approaching her and the very things that
[1:41:46] that they're talking to her about is
[1:41:48] because her life is declaring she's
[1:41:51] going to have a baby. What about the
[1:41:53] church of the living God? We ought to be
[1:41:55] so impregnated with the message of the
[1:41:57] hour that our very life is declaring his
[1:42:00] presence is declaring he's here. Is
[1:42:03] declaring the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:08] No, God, help me.
[1:42:11] Maybe we're so quiet because our lives
[1:42:13] aren't declaring it.
[1:42:16] May maybe we're so quiet because we
[1:42:19] realize we've fallen short. Maybe we're
[1:42:22] so quiet cuz we realize we got all these
[1:42:25] things hanging on us and we're not free.
[1:42:28] We're so bound down by Lady Oia. We're
[1:42:31] so bound down by the pressures of the
[1:42:33] age. We're so bound down by our job and
[1:42:35] what our friends think and by our
[1:42:37] culture and our fashions and our music.
[1:42:44] That's Come on.
[1:42:48] Hey, I'm just preaching what the prophet
[1:42:49] preached.
[1:42:51] A lot of us are in different places, so
[1:42:53] don't sit on me. There's somebody here
[1:42:56] that needs to hear it. But we get to a
[1:42:59] place of such an intellectual
[1:43:01] conception. preach to where I'm living,
[1:43:03] brother
[1:43:04] Matthew. Well, I'm trying to, but you're
[1:43:07] so intellectually full of understanding,
[1:43:09] you think you're above it.
[1:43:13] Now, this is my our pastor's sheep, so
[1:43:15] you forgive me for being a little rough.
[1:43:17] I I don't want to talk to another man's
[1:43:18] sheep that way, but I pray it's the word
[1:43:20] of God penetrating to your soul.
[1:43:24] A shaking.
[1:43:26] Come on. I know what God did for me.
[1:43:30] I know what meeting the pillar of fire
[1:43:32] did to me.
[1:43:35] And I look at others lives and I just
[1:43:37] want to see the same thing he did for
[1:43:39] me. He set my soul on fire.
[1:43:43] He changed me. He filled me with the
[1:43:47] Holy Ghost. And I just want the same
[1:43:49] thing for you, brother Gillan. I want
[1:43:51] the same thing for you, brother Ben. I
[1:43:53] want the same thing for each one of you.
[1:43:55] S preach the message in such a way that
[1:43:57] you can come to a place and meet that
[1:43:59] light for yourself
[1:44:03] that you can walk into your job with a
[1:44:05] confidence.
[1:44:08] Hey boss, just want to let you know I'm
[1:44:10] giving you my two weeks that I'm not
[1:44:11] working on Wednesday night anymore cuz
[1:44:14] I'm going to
[1:44:15] church. You know what? I know I'm
[1:44:18] self-employed and you think I ain't got
[1:44:20] that problem. I tell you right now, I
[1:44:23] would love the opportunity to do it
[1:44:25] because I love taking God at his word. I
[1:44:28] love putting the word first. I love a
[1:44:31] good old challenge. Cuz I've been there
[1:44:34] when my boss said, "Look, I'm sorry you
[1:44:36] got to work on Easter." I said, "Well,
[1:44:38] do you want to fire me or do you want to
[1:44:40] quit?" Because I don't work on the
[1:44:42] Lord's day. I said, "There ought to be
[1:44:44] some people rise up with a backbone
[1:44:47] that aren't afraid to declare the
[1:44:49] message. It's going home time. It's
[1:44:52] rapture time. It's bride time. It's seed
[1:44:56] time.
[1:44:59] And you're worried about the next career
[1:45:01] change
[1:45:03] over the word of God. Are you kidding
[1:45:05] me?
[1:45:09] Follow me.
[1:45:12] Peter and James, they didn't say, "It's
[1:45:15] a good catch. Let me catch some fish
[1:45:18] first. I got a job raise if I just put
[1:45:21] in the work.
[1:45:25] Come on.
[1:45:28] Are you with me? We're talking about
[1:45:30] revelation. It affects the way you act.
[1:45:32] We only got about an hour more, so just
[1:45:34] bear with
[1:45:36] me. Okay. Hallelujah.
[1:45:41] But Noah went to work. His faith put him
[1:45:44] in action. That's what I I love brother
[1:45:47] Billy's message.
[1:45:48] responsibility.
[1:45:50] You got to act on your commission. You
[1:45:52] got to act on the respon. You have a
[1:45:53] responsibility that God has entrusted
[1:45:55] with the message of the hour that you
[1:45:57] got to go declare he's the same
[1:45:59] yesterday, today, and forever. Malachi
[1:46:01] 4:5 couldn't receive a message from God
[1:46:03] and go stay in the cave his whole life.
[1:46:07] He had to go out and declare the
[1:46:09] message.
[1:46:10] And you too
[1:46:14] have to go out and declare the message.
[1:46:19] The prophet of God said, "It's going to
[1:46:20] take more faith than ever was in any age
[1:46:23] for this house to be rapturing faith to
[1:46:25] be taken up." I say we ought to be s in
[1:46:28] such
[1:46:30] expectation. Where we're singing lately,
[1:46:33] I've got leaving on my mind. Oh, it just
[1:46:36] seems like that's all I've been thinking
[1:46:38] about. Is that is that how you feel? Is
[1:46:41] that maybe what y'all's expectation is?
[1:46:44] says that's what's been dominating your
[1:46:46] thoughts is the rapture. Is that what's
[1:46:48] been dominating your thoughts is the
[1:46:50] message of the hour? Look, we know that
[1:46:52] faith comes by that kind of faith. We're
[1:46:56] talking about a rapturing faith comes by
[1:47:00] the message that we've heard.
[1:47:02] If you want rapturing faith, it's going
[1:47:04] to come by Malachi 4:5. Continuing on to
[1:47:07] why Christ speak. He says, "Just as we
[1:47:09] know, as a man asked me a few moments
[1:47:11] ago about the coming and the rapture, we
[1:47:14] know we've lived the time out at the
[1:47:17] time of the rapture is at hand. And
[1:47:19] we're looking for a rapturing faith."
[1:47:21] This is my inspiration right here. He
[1:47:23] says, "We're looking for a rapturing
[1:47:25] faith that can pull the church together
[1:47:28] and give it some supernatural strength
[1:47:31] that can change these bodies that we
[1:47:33] live in." Amen.
[1:47:35] Are you looking for it? Are you
[1:47:37] believing for it? Are you asking for it?
[1:47:40] Are you praying for it? Are you eating
[1:47:42] for it? Are you thinking for it?
[1:47:45] Or is it, you know, we believe the
[1:47:48] message? God sent a prophet.
[1:47:51] One of these great glorious days, he'll
[1:47:53] come. No.
[1:47:56] He
[1:47:57] says, "We've lived the time out at the
[1:48:01] time of the rapture is at hand, and
[1:48:02] we're looking for a rapture in faith
[1:48:04] that can pull the church together and
[1:48:05] give us some supernatural strength that
[1:48:07] can change these bodies that we live in.
[1:48:09] When we see a God that can raise the
[1:48:10] dead off the floor out here in the yard
[1:48:12] and bring them back to life again and
[1:48:14] present him before us. When we see a God
[1:48:16] who can take the cancer that eat a man
[1:48:18] to a shadow and raise them up to a
[1:48:20] strong, healthy man, that ought to give
[1:48:22] rapturing faith to the people." Oh, he's
[1:48:24] declaring that ought to give rapturing
[1:48:26] faith to the people that when that light
[1:48:28] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[1:48:30] sounds, the body of Christ will be
[1:48:32] quickly gathered together and changed in
[1:48:34] a moment and taken into the heavens.
[1:48:36] Yes, there's got to be something like
[1:48:38] that happen. I say we ought to just
[1:48:40] start praising God and believing and
[1:48:42] knowing, hey, there gots to be something
[1:48:44] like that happen. There's going to be a
[1:48:46] rapture. There's going to be a body
[1:48:48] change. Hey, I'm going to step out of
[1:48:50] this dimension and I'm stepping in
[1:48:52] another dimension. I am going into a
[1:48:55] millennium. I am going to a new
[1:48:57] Jerusalem. There are streets paved with
[1:48:59] gold. There is a tree of life. The gates
[1:49:02] have already been hung. I don't know
[1:49:04] about you. I'm not living for Lady Osia.
[1:49:06] I'm living to take that step into
[1:49:08] another dimension.
[1:49:11] It excites me.
[1:49:15] Maybe we'll talk about going to
[1:49:16] Disneyland. And that'll get some people
[1:49:18] excited.
[1:49:20] What's your favorite sports group? Oh,
[1:49:22] is the company doing another party?
[1:49:30] Look, I want to stay away from it, but I
[1:49:32] I know what a prophet taught. Church, we
[1:49:34] got to get in the spirit. Amen. We got
[1:49:37] to get in the spirit. We got to get in
[1:49:39] the spirit. We got to get in the spirit.
[1:49:43] I mean, that I I'm not the one that said
[1:49:45] it.
[1:49:48] Malachi 4:5 said it. We got to get in
[1:49:51] the spirit. He said, "You got to get in
[1:49:53] the spirit to make things happen." Yes,
[1:49:55] sir. You want to get in the spirit of a
[1:49:57] dance party, you'll dance. You want to
[1:49:59] get in the spirit of a ball game, you'll
[1:50:01] get happy and hoop and holler. And he
[1:50:03] said, "You got to get in the spirit."
[1:50:08] Friends, we got to break through. Yes,
[1:50:10] sir. We got to break through and break
[1:50:12] out. I I don't know what's hanging over
[1:50:14] us, but I say, "Oh, God, shake these
[1:50:16] heavy hands. Break this cloud of
[1:50:18] darkness that's over us that we can be
[1:50:20] set free to believe God for all things."
[1:50:23] Amen. I say, "Where are we living? Are
[1:50:26] you living in Lady Osia or are you
[1:50:29] living in a bride age?"
[1:50:31] Some of us, we're so caught up in Lady
[1:50:34] Osia. We're so hung up in the things of
[1:50:37] this world that we are not enjoying the
[1:50:39] benefits
[1:50:41] of the message of the hour. Amen. Hey,
[1:50:44] I'm living in it. I'm soaring in it.
[1:50:50] Hallelujah. I say, let's go, church.
[1:50:53] Let's get in the spirit.
[1:50:56] Let's get happy.
[1:50:58] Let's get excited.
[1:51:00] We're not going to Disneyland.
[1:51:03] We're not going on vacation.
[1:51:07] Oh, glory.
[1:51:10] Kids get real excited when Christmas is
[1:51:12] around the corner.
[1:51:14] I don't know. Maybe we got to make a
[1:51:16] connection here. Is there something
[1:51:18] anybody's happy about?
[1:51:24] Are any of y'all Is anybody going on a
[1:51:26] trip that you're really excited about?
[1:51:28] Is anybody going overseas?
[1:51:30] Is anybody really excited about going
[1:51:32] over to Europe? Oh, yeah. And you just
[1:51:35] can't wait. It's so exciting. You're
[1:51:37] researching and you're looking, oh, it's
[1:51:40] going to I want to eat here and I want
[1:51:42] to eat there. How should I dress? What's
[1:51:44] the weather like?
[1:51:46] Oh, Malachi 4:5 come to tell you. This
[1:51:49] is where we're going. This is how you
[1:51:51] ought to dress. This is how you want to
[1:51:53] approach your Lord. Hey, get all things
[1:51:56] ready. I I've come to introduce you to
[1:51:59] your Messiah.
[1:52:01] I say you ought to get excited.
[1:52:04] Hey, we're going home. We're going in a
[1:52:07] rapture.
[1:52:08] I don't care about a paycheck on Friday.
[1:52:11] I don't care about my bills. I care
[1:52:14] about the word.
[1:52:16] [Applause]
[1:52:17] That ought to
[1:52:19] be more of a reality to you than the pew
[1:52:22] that you're sitting on.
[1:52:26] I said, "That ought to be more of a
[1:52:28] reality to you than the pew you're
[1:52:29] sitting on."
[1:52:34] And you should live for that
[1:52:36] reality. He said, "We're looking for a
[1:52:39] rapturing faith that can pull the church
[1:52:41] together and give it some supernatural
[1:52:45] strength. Education won't produce
[1:52:48] it." If if if you hear something that's
[1:52:50] familiar, just for for Matthew's sake,
[1:52:52] just say, "Amen." Amen. That'd be that'd
[1:52:54] be
[1:52:56] nice. So, uh, education won't produce
[1:52:59] it.
[1:53:02] Hallelujah. Maybe I'll read that quote
[1:53:04] before. We're looking for a rapturing
[1:53:05] faith that can pull the church together
[1:53:07] and give us some supernatural strength.
[1:53:08] Amen.
[1:53:10] So I mean sometimes it helps if I say a
[1:53:13] vindicated
[1:53:14] prophet brother Brandham Malachi 4:5
[1:53:18] said we're looking for a rapturing faith
[1:53:21] that can pull the church together and
[1:53:22] give us some supernatural strength. So
[1:53:25] you know what I'm looking for? I'm
[1:53:26] looking
[1:53:28] for a rapturing faith that can pull the
[1:53:31] church together and give us some
[1:53:32] supernatural strength. I'm looking for
[1:53:34] supernatural strength. Amen. And I
[1:53:36] believe supernatural strength is already
[1:53:38] in me.
[1:53:40] I believe everything that I ever had
[1:53:42] need of, God already placed it inside of
[1:53:44] me. And he sent a message to awaken the
[1:53:47] seed on the inside of me to say, you are
[1:53:50] the bride of Christ. You can do the
[1:53:52] greater works. You can go in a rapture.
[1:53:54] You can step into another dimension. You
[1:53:57] can go into a body change.
[1:54:00] And there's a seed of faith in me that
[1:54:02] says, "Amen." Amen.
[1:54:05] Amen.
[1:54:06] I can do the greater works. Amen. I am
[1:54:10] going to a body church. Amen. I do have
[1:54:13] supernatural strength. Amen. There is a
[1:54:16] rapturing faith to pull the church
[1:54:18] together. Amen.
[1:54:22] Oh, the prophet of God said
[1:54:24] that Moses knew he was born for a
[1:54:27] purpose because he was taught
[1:54:29] right. But he said intellectual faith is
[1:54:32] not enough.
[1:54:33] You have to meet that light that brings
[1:54:35] the word to a reality.
[1:54:40] Because when you get into the trenches,
[1:54:43] when you get into those dark places,
[1:54:45] when you get into those hard times,
[1:54:46] you're going to need a reality of the
[1:54:48] word and not just an intellectual
[1:54:50] conception of the word. Because Moses
[1:54:53] found out real quick when he went out
[1:54:54] there and murdered a man, he didn't have
[1:54:56] the power that he thought he had because
[1:54:58] what did he do? He ran.
[1:55:02] But when all of his strength was gone,
[1:55:06] when he had no more
[1:55:08] ability, all of his alliances in Egypt,
[1:55:11] you know, maybe he could have talked to
[1:55:12] this general and and maybe he found
[1:55:14] favor with this guy and and all of these
[1:55:16] things, you know, maybe he could have
[1:55:17] come in the back door and he could have
[1:55:19] talked up an army and he he could have
[1:55:21] he could have took him. Nope. When
[1:55:23] everything was
[1:55:25] gone, the prophet of God said, "The
[1:55:27] burning bush had what Moses
[1:55:30] lacked. This message has what we lack."
[1:55:35] Yes, we are predestinated. I'm not done
[1:55:37] preaching. We got some we got some more
[1:55:39] hay on the
[1:55:40] fork. And and you know, this is this is
[1:55:43] uh this is all voluntary. So, if you
[1:55:46] want to go, I understand.
[1:55:49] It is voluntary, right?
[1:55:52] Absolutely. This is all
[1:55:55] voluntary. I love it. That's what people
[1:55:57] tell me when I I'll do something for
[1:55:59] them. They go, "You didn't have to do
[1:56:00] that." I said, "I know. If I had to, I
[1:56:02] wouldn't have wanted
[1:56:04] to." It's like one time I I I got Man, I
[1:56:07] was I I was I was I was uh uh so so
[1:56:11] excited. You know, the thought come my
[1:56:13] heart. You know what? I'm going to mow
[1:56:14] the lawn for my dad. It's getting long
[1:56:17] out there. I need to mow the yard. I I
[1:56:18] get a So, I put my tennis shoes on and
[1:56:20] and I put some clothes on and I was all
[1:56:22] happy. I'm going to do something for my
[1:56:23] dad. And I hit that front door and
[1:56:25] opened it up. My dad said, "Hey, son, go
[1:56:27] mow the
[1:56:30] yard." And I wasn't excited
[1:56:33] anymore. I didn't even want to do it
[1:56:36] anymore because it was no longer
[1:56:43] optional. But, you know, coming to
[1:56:45] church is optional. We are free moral
[1:56:47] agents. Isn't that wonderful that you
[1:56:50] can choose to come to church or you can
[1:56:51] choose to go to work? I choose to go to
[1:56:54] church. Amen. Hey, we won't try to keep
[1:56:56] you much longer. Just a few more
[1:56:57] minutes. But I say we ought to be living
[1:56:59] for the reality of the word. We ought to
[1:57:01] be living for that rapturing faith and
[1:57:03] that supernatural strength that can pull
[1:57:05] the church together. And it's not going
[1:57:06] to come by an intellectual conception.
[1:57:09] Brother Random said intellectual faith
[1:57:10] is not enough. You got to meet that
[1:57:12] light that brings the word to a reality.
[1:57:15] So continuing on to why Christ speak. He
[1:57:16] says there was that go there was the God
[1:57:19] of Abraham speaking of the burning bush.
[1:57:20] He says there was the God of Abraham in
[1:57:22] that light. A pillar of fire back in the
[1:57:24] bush. That fire like waves going out but
[1:57:27] it didn't bother the bush. And the voice
[1:57:29] of the scripture, the voice of God spoke
[1:57:32] through there and said, "I have chosen
[1:57:33] you. You are the man. I raised you up
[1:57:36] for this purpose. I'm proven to you here
[1:57:39] by signs. You're going down to deliver
[1:57:41] the children because my word has got to
[1:57:43] be fulfilled." Oh, his word of this day
[1:57:46] has got to be fulfilled. We're living in
[1:57:49] the hour. No matter what anyone else
[1:57:51] says, the word has to be fulfilled.
[1:57:54] Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[1:57:56] not his word. He said, now when Moses
[1:58:00] got all this together and seen by every
[1:58:02] direction, it anointed his faith. Amen.
[1:58:06] Amen. Oh my, what a thought. This a self
[1:58:10] itself seeing the scriptures pointed
[1:58:12] right straight to what it was and the
[1:58:15] speaking God an evidence of it there it
[1:58:18] anointed what faith he had in him to go
[1:58:21] to work
[1:58:25] now we all want some big thing to do but
[1:58:28] God's wanting to anoint your faith to
[1:58:29] testify to your neighbor God's wanting
[1:58:31] to anoint your faith that you don't got
[1:58:32] to work Wednesday night God's wanting to
[1:58:34] anoint your faith that you ain't got to
[1:58:35] work on Sunday call me a crazy man but
[1:58:38] if I see something in the word of God by
[1:58:40] faith, I can have it. I don't got to
[1:58:43] work on Sunday and I ain't got to work
[1:58:45] on Wednesday night because God told me I
[1:58:47] can have what I asked for if it's
[1:58:48] according to the word. Then you can go
[1:58:50] in there and act according to your faith
[1:58:52] and go into your boss or go into this or
[1:58:54] going to that. Say, "Hey, I want to be
[1:58:56] at church for communion and there ain't
[1:58:58] going to be no devil in hell. There
[1:59:00] ain't going to be no paycheck. I'll
[1:59:02] sleep under a bridge, but I'm going to
[1:59:04] be in the house of God to take
[1:59:06] communion."
[1:59:08] Oh, when you get into desperation and
[1:59:10] you get serious, God will back you up.
[1:59:15] Anointed what faith he had in I don't
[1:59:17] know why we kept hitting that a million
[1:59:18] times, but somebody needed to hear it.
[1:59:21] Anointed what faith he had in him to go
[1:59:23] to work. What ought it do to us?
[1:59:27] I feel this is a good time to drop this
[1:59:29] in there. I was reading a quote. Brother
[1:59:31] Brother Random said, "Brother Neville
[1:59:33] preached about 45
[1:59:35] minutes and he started to close up." He
[1:59:38] said, "Man, what a shame. I was just
[1:59:40] getting stirred in my spirit. We were
[1:59:42] just getting started. So, I just want to
[1:59:46] drop that in. I'm just getting stirred
[1:59:47] up. I'm just getting a little excited. I
[1:59:50] feel like we're just getting
[1:59:51] started." And and once again, it's
[1:59:54] optional. Remember
[1:59:55] that. He
[1:59:59] says, "What ought he he goes and
[2:00:02] evidence they anointed what faith he had
[2:00:04] for him to go to work. What ought it do
[2:00:06] to us? We need a repentance. We need a
[2:00:09] revival." I'm saying
[2:00:12] myself. See, I need a shaking. I need
[2:00:15] something. I said I was speaking to
[2:00:17] myself this morning about myself. I need
[2:00:20] a wakening up. Church, we need a
[2:00:22] repentance. We need a revival. We need a
[2:00:25] shaking. We need a waking up.
[2:00:31] I read it again. Hey, we got to get in
[2:00:33] the spirit of it. If the prophet said
[2:00:36] that's what he needed, I'm going to say,
[2:00:37] little old Master McGary, I need the
[2:00:39] same thing. What ought it do to us? We
[2:00:41] need a repentance. We need a revival.
[2:00:44] I'm saying myself, see, I need a
[2:00:46] shaking. I need something. I said I was
[2:00:48] speaking to myself this morning about
[2:00:49] myself. I need awakening up.
[2:00:53] We need awakening up. Wake up. Wake up.
[2:00:57] It's the coming of the Lord. It's the
[2:00:59] midnight cry. Shake yourself.
[2:01:04] And if you've already been shaken, go
[2:01:06] shake your neighbor. Go shake your
[2:01:08] family. Go shake shake your coworker.
[2:01:12] Lift up the name of Jesus. Lift up the
[2:01:15] message.
[2:01:16] Amen.
[2:01:18] Brother Brandham said, "I know that down
[2:01:20] in every man's heart there's something
[2:01:21] that yearns to see the supernatural.
[2:01:26] I don't know about you."
[2:01:29] I have never been so excited in all my
[2:01:32] life about a pope.
[2:01:39] I mean, I have never cared.
[2:01:43] I have never cared except how brother
[2:01:46] Brandham would go through some of the
[2:01:48] teachings and about the pope coming to
[2:01:50] America and the moons and certain things
[2:01:54] and and those great things that lay
[2:01:55] within the message and how uh things in
[2:01:57] heaven are, you know, they're declared
[2:01:59] in the natural and so you can study
[2:02:01] those things. They're they're very good
[2:02:02] to study. But as far as yo, you know,
[2:02:05] the historical part of it, but
[2:02:07] my when they elected or chose a pope
[2:02:11] from the United States
[2:02:14] My ears perked up
[2:02:18] because even the whole world said it was
[2:02:20] a phenomenon.
[2:02:22] I mean, they thought no one would they
[2:02:24] would never choose a pope out of the
[2:02:25] United States. They would never choose a
[2:02:28] pope to represent the greatest power on
[2:02:30] earth.
[2:02:32] You say, "Well, why is that so
[2:02:34] significant?" Well, let me tell you.
[2:02:36] Come on.
[2:02:38] Because in 19 now, I don't know about
[2:02:40] you, but hey, I'm not saying it is, but
[2:02:44] it sure looks like it is. Because, you
[2:02:47] know, everybody looked when when when it
[2:02:49] was prophesied that he saw a woman
[2:02:52] ruler,
[2:02:53] he said it could be a vice president or
[2:02:55] a president or the Catholic Church.
[2:02:59] See, we didn't need to see a vice
[2:03:02] president standing there arrayed in
[2:03:03] purple, but it was declaring something
[2:03:06] that already took place in the
[2:03:07] supernatural. We we were seeing a
[2:03:09] natural event declare what had already
[2:03:12] happened that that America's already
[2:03:14] wormed up through all of its cabinets
[2:03:16] with the Roman Catholic Church.
[2:03:21] We we have the most Roman uh Catholic
[2:03:24] government we've ever had. We have the
[2:03:25] most Roman Catholic uh Supreme Court
[2:03:28] that we've ever had. Look, this is all
[2:03:31] prophecy.
[2:03:33] So when I look back in 1954 and it
[2:03:36] prophesies, I believe one of these
[2:03:37] glorious days when the United Conf
[2:03:40] Confederation of Church goes together
[2:03:43] and the new pope is brought out of the
[2:03:46] United States and put over there
[2:03:48] according to prophecy,
[2:03:50] then they'll form an image like under
[2:03:52] the beast. And I tell you,
[2:03:55] Come on. The true church of God will be
[2:03:58] drove together. Hallelujah. I'm being
[2:04:02] drove together. There is a pull here.
[2:04:05] The third pool, the opening of the word
[2:04:07] that is pulling the church together.
[2:04:10] It's going all Look up. Your redemption
[2:04:13] drawth nigh.
[2:04:16] That ought to excite your soul.
[2:04:19] Or are you still wanting to go to
[2:04:20] Disneyland?
[2:04:23] Lord, just wait another two weeks. I got
[2:04:26] great big
[2:04:28] plans. Oh, I want to tell
[2:04:30] you, this far exceeds anything the
[2:04:33] natural could offer
[2:04:35] me. This might be the one or not, but I
[2:04:39] want to tell you, it stirs my soul to
[2:04:41] know I'm living in one of the I'm living
[2:04:43] in the greatest moment ever known to
[2:04:45] mankind.
[2:04:46] I said, I'm living in the greatest
[2:04:48] moment ever known to mankind.
[2:04:51] Look, we see prophecy being fulfilled.
[2:04:54] We see modern events being made clear by
[2:04:56] prophecy. We see the end time signed
[2:05:00] seed. It's harvest time. It's going home
[2:05:04] time. I said it's going home time. It's
[2:05:08] going home time. He said when you see a
[2:05:11] pope come out of the United States,
[2:05:13] yeah, it's driving the ecumenical
[2:05:14] council and everything together, but
[2:05:16] there's going to be something else that
[2:05:17] drives the bride of Christ together.
[2:05:22] I try to make this last stretch. Just
[2:05:24] give me about five to seven minutes and
[2:05:27] I'll start
[2:05:32] closing. We see all these things
[2:05:34] happening. But but the prophet of God,
[2:05:36] I'm just going to preface something
[2:05:37] before I read out his end time sightsee.
[2:05:39] But he says, he says, "Look, the
[2:05:41] denominationals, they're looking for
[2:05:42] oil. The Pentecostals, they're calling
[2:05:44] for healing and calling for revivals.
[2:05:46] They're calling for healing services. Uh
[2:05:49] they're wanting to see the gifts
[2:05:50] operating in the church. He said an end
[2:05:52] time sign seed. He said, "What are they
[2:05:53] trying to do? Get oil in their lamps."
[2:05:57] Exactly. It's that's the end time sign.
[2:06:00] Amen. When she was trying to do
[2:06:03] that, this is 1962.
[2:06:07] The bridegroom come and the bride went
[2:06:09] in. She was locked out. Oh, what a
[2:06:13] wonderful day we're living in. Amen. I
[2:06:17] said, "What a wonderful day we're living
[2:06:20] in." To think that we are living in the
[2:06:23] moments of the catching away of the
[2:06:25] bride of Jesus Christ that Paul wanted
[2:06:27] to live here. Peter wanted to live here.
[2:06:29] All of those that went before, they all
[2:06:31] wanted to live here. And God chose me.
[2:06:34] He chose you to live in the most
[2:06:36] climactical age that man has ever. I
[2:06:39] believe I'm preaching to a people. Look,
[2:06:41] if I don't see the change of my body, I
[2:06:43] believe these young people here Yeah,
[2:06:46] we'll be able to manifest the scripture.
[2:06:49] Oh death, where is your sting? Oh crave,
[2:06:52] where is your victory? Brother
[2:06:53] Christian, I believe one of these days
[2:06:55] you'll be changed in a moment and a
[2:06:57] twinkling of an eye. You'll put death
[2:06:59] under your feet. I want to be here. The
[2:07:01] prophet wanted to be here.
[2:07:04] And I believe I'll be here. But I'm
[2:07:05] telling you, I believe there's people
[2:07:07] sitting here that are going to manifest
[2:07:09] the prophecy of the hour.
[2:07:12] What a wonderful time where you ought to
[2:07:14] live for it, church.
[2:07:16] You ought to pour your heart and soul
[2:07:18] into this message.
[2:07:25] Hallelujah. What a time we're living
[2:07:28] in. Churches are being united under an
[2:07:31] ecumenical
[2:07:33] council. The spring rain has come.
[2:07:38] What? The sewing rain has come.
[2:07:40] The teaching reign has come. Brother
[2:07:41] Brandham
[2:07:43] preached spoken word is the original
[2:07:45] seed. An end times side seed. He said,
[2:07:47] what did he say? He said, the
[2:07:48] denominational seed has been sown. He
[2:07:51] said, the Pentecostal seed has been
[2:07:52] sown. He said, but the word seed has
[2:07:55] been sown. And he goes on to say, but
[2:07:56] the word of God has been sowed also.
[2:08:00] And when the spirit of God begins to
[2:08:01] fall, the word of God will live in a
[2:08:04] people. And that false bride that's
[2:08:06] committed adultery out there and brought
[2:08:07] herself into creeds and sold out her
[2:08:09] birthright will reap what? A
[2:08:10] confederation of churches, that's to be
[2:08:13] bound and burned like the thorns and
[2:08:15] thistles. But where the word of God has
[2:08:17] been sowed into the people's heart, it
[2:08:20] will reap a bride for Christ as certain
[2:08:22] as I'm standing here. End time sign. I
[2:08:26] want to say you are an end time sign.
[2:08:30] The prophet of God said the word would
[2:08:33] be sown into the hearts of a believer
[2:08:35] and it would reap a bride for Christ. I
[2:08:38] am looking I am looking at the harvest.
[2:08:45] This message has reaped a bribe for our
[2:08:48] Lord Jesus Christ and you are that
[2:08:51] harvest.
[2:08:54] Oh hallelujah. I'll just ask brother
[2:08:57] John to come help me with a song.
[2:09:01] Hallelujah. Look, this message has to be
[2:09:04] your reality.
[2:09:09] I know you got bills.
[2:09:11] I know you got to go to
[2:09:13] work. I I know the electric bill's
[2:09:16] coming and you got to pay
[2:09:17] it. I know you're trying to make ends
[2:09:20] meet. I know you're sick in your
[2:09:23] body. I I I know you you want to be able
[2:09:26] to get a bigger house. I know you want
[2:09:28] to get out of that apartment. I I know
[2:09:30] all of those things, but that's in one
[2:09:32] sense.
[2:09:35] But there's another sense.
[2:09:38] There's another sense, a six sense of
[2:09:41] faith when you can go into India and
[2:09:44] there be believers digging six, seven
[2:09:46] feet down into the ground and putting a
[2:09:48] little satch roof over it and that's
[2:09:50] where they gather for church down there
[2:09:53] in that little little plane. And when
[2:09:55] all the the rains come, it totally
[2:09:58] washes
[2:10:00] their little church and all that mud
[2:10:02] away.
[2:10:05] You think they're upset and disappointed
[2:10:06] about it? Say, "Brother, well, what do
[2:10:09] you do when the rains come and wash it
[2:10:11] all away? What do you do?" He goes,
[2:10:13] "Oh, we just rebuild it, brother." Amen.
[2:10:18] They're living over there in mud huts
[2:10:21] and gathering in holes in the ground.
[2:10:24] But that's in one sense. In another
[2:10:27] sense, they have heard from their
[2:10:29] theophony. They're just as rich as any
[2:10:32] believer because they have come in
[2:10:34] contact with the logos. They have come
[2:10:36] in contact with the message. They don't
[2:10:39] care whether they're in a hole in the
[2:10:40] ground. I don't care whether you're in a
[2:10:42] highrise. It won't do you any good
[2:10:44] unless you've got contacted with the
[2:10:46] message of the hour.
[2:10:51] Oh, there's another sense.
[2:10:56] This message is a reality, church.
[2:10:59] I say look up.
[2:11:02] Your redemption drawth nigh. I know you
[2:11:04] got
[2:11:04] problems, but we got a message to take
[2:11:07] us out of our problems.
[2:11:09] gross darkness upon the people,
[2:11:12] but arise and shine.
[2:11:16] Thy light has come.
[2:11:19] Paul said in Hebrews 11:24, "By
[2:11:22] faith," Moses, when he had come to
[2:11:24] years, refused to be called the son of
[2:11:25] Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to
[2:11:28] suffer the afflictions with the people
[2:11:29] of God than to enjoy the pleasures of
[2:11:31] sin for a
[2:11:33] season. Oh, God help us. Some of us are
[2:11:36] enjoying pleasures of sin for a season.
[2:11:40] But I pray that your faith gets past of
[2:11:42] intellectual conception. Well, you'll
[2:11:44] start taking God at his word. There's
[2:11:46] little things laying in your life that
[2:11:48] declare you haven't sold out locks,
[2:11:50] stock, and barrel. The way we carry
[2:11:53] ourselves and the certain things we do,
[2:11:55] we can
[2:11:56] see. But oh, when when Moses faith was
[2:11:59] anointed, he said, "Choosing rather to
[2:12:01] suffer the affliction with the people of
[2:12:02] God than enjoy the pleasures of sin for
[2:12:04] season." No. Moses knew there was
[2:12:05] something in him. There was something in
[2:12:07] him, right? He he he believed that was
[2:12:10] his people. But he tried to fulfill that
[2:12:12] in his own
[2:12:15] ability. But when that intellectual
[2:12:18] understanding became
[2:12:19] anointed, he could come down there with
[2:12:21] a stick in his hand and say, "Let my
[2:12:23] people go." Because it was no longer a
[2:12:25] man going. It was God going in the form
[2:12:29] of a man. He said, "Esteeming the
[2:12:31] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[2:12:33] the treasures in Egypt, for he had
[2:12:34] respect under the recompense of the
[2:12:36] reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not
[2:12:38] fearing the wrath of the king, for he
[2:12:40] endured, seeing him who was
[2:12:43] invisible." Brother Brandham says this
[2:12:46] as we bring this to a close. He says,
[2:12:47] "But when faith when faith looks at
[2:12:49] God's worst,"
[2:12:52] here was here was
[2:12:54] Moses looking out the window of the
[2:12:57] palace and seeing the people of God
[2:13:03] dirtbers in mud
[2:13:05] holes making bricks. He says, "But when
[2:13:08] faith when faith looks at God's worst,
[2:13:11] it esteems it greater and more valuable
[2:13:13] than the best the world can show." Yes,
[2:13:16] sir. When faith looks at it, when faith
[2:13:18] can see it, when faith in the word can
[2:13:20] see the word made manifest, it's more to
[2:13:22] them than all the glamour and
[2:13:24] archbishopry and everything else you can
[2:13:26] speak of. Faith does it. See, he goes on
[2:13:29] to say, for you see, faith sees what God
[2:13:32] wants done. Oh, God, help us to see what
[2:13:35] you done want done with this message.
[2:13:37] What did he say? He said, here is the
[2:13:38] secret. The word is in the bride.
[2:13:42] She knows what he wants done with the
[2:13:44] word. Amen.
[2:13:46] He says, "For you see, faith sees what
[2:13:48] God wants done. Oh, I hope this goes
[2:13:49] in." Faith doesn't look at the present
[2:13:51] time. Faith doesn't see this here. Faith
[2:13:54] looks to see what God wants and it works
[2:13:56] accordingly. That's what faith does. It
[2:13:59] sees what God wants and what God wants
[2:14:02] done. And faith operates through that.
[2:14:05] Faith is a long range vision. It doesn't
[2:14:09] lower its sight. It holds to the target.
[2:14:12] Amen. Oh church, we have a message. This
[2:14:16] message didn't come to make us lukewarm.
[2:14:18] This message didn't come to make us
[2:14:20] starchy. This message came to give you a
[2:14:22] long range vision. I ain't looking at
[2:14:24] Lady Osia. I'm looking at a pride age.
[2:14:27] I'm looking at going home. I'm looking
[2:14:29] at a rapture. My faith has anchored in a
[2:14:32] body change. My faith is anchored in the
[2:14:34] revelation of the rapture. I'm going
[2:14:36] home. I got my ticket out of here.
[2:14:40] I said I got my ticket out of here. Hey,
[2:14:42] one of these days I'm going to be gone.
[2:14:45] You can have Lady Oia. You can have the
[2:14:48] fashions and the glamour of this world,
[2:14:50] but one of these days I'm going to be
[2:14:52] changed and I'm going to be
[2:14:55] gone. Hallelujah. Why don't you praise
[2:14:57] the Lord? Why don't you praise God?
[2:15:00] We're going in a rapture. We're going in
[2:15:03] a body change. I got a
[2:15:06] message.
[2:15:09] Hallelujah. Why don't you praise God?
[2:15:12] Why don't you praise the Lord? It's
[2:15:14] going home time, church.
[2:15:21] Hallelujah.
[2:15:24] no longer earthbound.
[2:15:27] Church, I say if anything, when we
[2:15:31] see prophecy being fulfilled,
[2:15:37] when I see a pope come out of the United
[2:15:40] States and I see the Roman Catholic
[2:15:43] Church coming into
[2:15:45] power, prophet of God
[2:15:49] said a national
[2:15:52] force put Israel back in their homeland.
[2:15:55] National force will drive all the
[2:15:57] economical moves and everything
[2:15:58] together. He said, "But the power of God
[2:16:01] will put the people in the bride."
[2:16:04] There's a power here. Oh, when I see
[2:16:06] prophecy being fulfilled, I say, "Oh,
[2:16:08] let's get all the leaven out." Yes,
[2:16:10] Lord. Hey, delete all the apps that are
[2:16:12] unpleasing. Get off the Netflix. Get off
[2:16:15] the websites. Quit entertaining those
[2:16:17] boys and those girls. Hey, quit messing
[2:16:19] with the things of the world. It ain't
[2:16:21] time for that.
[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:31] Oh, this message is real.
[2:16:37] When Joshua stood
[2:16:38] there, he said, "Make you sharp
[2:16:43] swords. We're going over."
[2:16:47] I imagine Caleb.
[2:16:51] Hallelujah.
[2:16:53] I've been believing for this for 60
[2:16:55] years. Brother Joshua,
[2:16:58] give me my mountain.
[2:17:01] I'm more able today. Oh, Brother David,
[2:17:04] you're more able today than when you
[2:17:07] heard this message in San Diego. We're
[2:17:09] more able today to take a body change.
[2:17:13] We're more able today to lay hands on
[2:17:15] the sick and they recover. We're more
[2:17:17] able today to do the greater works.
[2:17:20] Why? I've come in the presence of the
[2:17:24] logos. I've come into the presence of
[2:17:26] the son of
[2:17:28] man. It is the revealing of the son of
[2:17:31] man.
[2:17:35] No longer earthbound.
[2:17:38] We're crossing
[2:17:40] over. The pool is here.
[2:17:45] The third
[2:17:46] pull revealing
[2:17:49] Christ to
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:59] united. Lost are
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:02] saved find their
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:06] way at the
[2:18:10] sound of your great name.
[2:18:15] [Music]
[2:18:22] came at the
[2:18:26] sound of your great name.
[2:18:30] Oh, every
[2:18:34] Oh, it has no
[2:18:38] place at the
[2:18:42] sound of your great
[2:18:45] name. The
[2:18:49] enemy. He has to leave.
[2:18:55] at the
[2:18:57] sound of your great
[2:19:02] name. Oh
[2:19:07] Jesus, worthy is the lamb that was saved
[2:19:13] for
[2:19:14] us. Your son of
[2:19:17] God. Oh, you are high and lifted up.
[2:19:24] and all the world will praise your great
[2:19:28] name.
[2:19:35] All the
[2:19:38] weak find their
[2:19:42] strength. Oh, at the
[2:19:46] sound of your great name.
[2:19:51] Oh hungry
[2:19:54] souls they receive. Hallelujah.
[2:19:58] Why don't you open up your heart and
[2:19:59] receive the grace?
[2:20:02] Receive the healing of your great name.
[2:20:06] Oh the fatherless.
[2:20:11] [Music]
[2:20:12] I'm
[2:20:14] very Oh, you at the
[2:20:18] sound of your great
[2:20:22] name. Oh, and the sing. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:20:28] and the dead
[2:20:31] are at the
[2:20:33] [Music]
[2:20:35] sound of your great name.
[2:20:44] Jesus, worthy is the lamb that was slain
[2:20:51] for
[2:20:52] us. Your son and God and made. You are
[2:20:57] high and lifted
[2:21:00] up. Oh, and all the world will praise
[2:21:04] your great name.
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:12] Prophet of God said in uniting time and
[2:21:16] sign. He said God is uniting his
[2:21:19] bride. She is coming together from the
[2:21:23] east and the west and the north and the
[2:21:27] south. There's a uniting time and that's
[2:21:31] on right now. What is she uniting for?
[2:21:36] the rapture.
[2:21:38] Amen. God's getting her ready. Yes, sir.
[2:21:40] Uniting. What is she uniting with? With
[2:21:43] the word. For all heavens and earth will
[2:21:46] pass away. But my word shall never pass
[2:21:49] away. She's uniting herself with thus
[2:21:53] saith the Lord. Regardless of what any
[2:21:55] denomination or anybody else says, she's
[2:21:58] uniting herself. She's getting ready.
[2:22:02] Why?
[2:22:03] She is the bride. Amen.
[2:22:06] You are the bride.
[2:22:09] You are the bride. You are the bride.
[2:22:12] Tell yourself, "I am the bride. I am the
[2:22:15] bride."
[2:22:17] That's right. And she's uniting herself
[2:22:20] with her bridegroom.
[2:22:22] See, and the bridegroom is the word.
[2:22:28] Can you see it?
[2:22:30] Hallelujah.
[2:22:34] You're united right now.
[2:22:40] The church world's looking for a coming
[2:22:41] in the sky.
[2:22:45] They're looking for Revelations 17. I
[2:22:47] believe it is coming in the clouds and
[2:22:50] every eye seeing in everyone beholding
[2:22:52] them. But no, I believe it's Revelation
[2:22:55] 17 or 16. He says, "I come as a thief.
[2:22:58] [Music]
[2:23:00] It's not a public show.
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:05] And we heard the
[2:23:09] message. The Elijah ministry declaring
[2:23:11] he's here.
[2:23:14] Go ye out to meet
[2:23:15] him. Walk away from your
[2:23:18] problems. Come out of your
[2:23:22] denominations. Come out of her, my
[2:23:24] people. Don't be a partaker of your
[2:23:26] plagues.
[2:23:28] He's here. Amen. Well, take take your
[2:23:30] problems to him. I know you're hurting.
[2:23:33] I know you're aching. I know you got
[2:23:36] questions. You don't need a man. You
[2:23:38] need him.
[2:23:42] And a vindicated prophet said, "My
[2:23:44] message is to declare that he's here,
[2:23:49] here to go to you wherever you're at
[2:23:51] right now if you want him to."
[2:23:54] As we sing the song again, I wonder if
[2:23:55] you say,
[2:23:57] "Lord, maybe I'm a little like Moses."
[2:24:00] That's okay. At least Moses believed the
[2:24:01] right
[2:24:04] thing. But he he needed he needed a
[2:24:07] greater
[2:24:08] experience. He needed a burning bush
[2:24:13] experience. And maybe you find yourself
[2:24:15] not able
[2:24:17] to manifest the word in certain out uh
[2:24:20] parts of your life. Maybe you just say,
[2:24:21] "Lord, would you anoint my faith?"
[2:24:25] See, Moses was chosen, but the prophet
[2:24:28] said he had to come to a place where his
[2:24:30] faith was
[2:24:31] anointed. Then he could act out on his
[2:24:33] commission. Maybe somebody here says,
[2:24:37] "God, I want you to come and anoint my
[2:24:41] faith. Then I can act out on my
[2:24:43] commission." She's uniting herself with
[2:24:45] the bridegroom. See, the bridegroom is
[2:24:47] the word. In the beginning was the word
[2:24:49] and the word was with God and the word
[2:24:50] was God and the word was made flesh and
[2:24:52] dwelt among us. And the church and the
[2:24:55] bride and the word is becoming so one
[2:24:57] until the very word itself is working
[2:24:59] out the works of the bridegroom.
[2:25:03] friends. While others are trying to tear
[2:25:06] the church
[2:25:07] apart, while spirits and men are trying
[2:25:10] to cause division amongst the message,
[2:25:12] why while there's there's spirits trying
[2:25:14] to say uh this and that and and and make
[2:25:19] all kind of
[2:25:20] divisions, we have a message.
[2:25:23] There's a pool. The third pull of the
[2:25:26] word dear declaring Christ and it's
[2:25:28] actually uniting us together. Amen.
[2:25:31] We're not uniting around the words of a
[2:25:33] man. We're uniting around thus saith the
[2:25:37] Lord.
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:41] Until every word itself is working out
[2:25:43] the works of the bridegroom and lost are
[2:25:47] saved. If you feel you'd like prayer,
[2:25:49] we're happy to pray with you. Find their
[2:25:53] way at the
[2:25:56] sound of your great
[2:26:01] name. Walking
[2:26:06] feel no
[2:26:09] shame at the
[2:26:11] [Music]
[2:26:12] sound of your name.
[2:26:18] Every fear, every fear has no
[2:26:25] place at the
[2:26:28] sound of your great name.
[2:26:33] the
[2:26:36] enemy. He has to
[2:26:41] leave at the
[2:26:44] sound of your great name.
[2:26:54] Jesus, worthy is the lamb that was
[2:26:59] slain for
[2:27:01] us and son of God and made. Oh, you are
[2:27:07] high and lifted
[2:27:09] up and all the world will praise your
[2:27:14] great name.
[2:27:21] And when all
[2:27:25] we find their
[2:27:28] strength and at the
[2:27:32] sound of your great
[2:27:36] name, oh hungry
[2:27:40] souls, they receive
[2:27:44] great at the
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:49] of your great
[2:27:52] king. Oh the
[2:27:56] father. Oh family.
[2:28:02] Oh, at the
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:05] sound of your great name. Oh, the
[2:28:14] [Music]
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:26] sed Jesus.
[2:28:30] Oh, and worthy is the lamb of
[2:28:36] sla for us. Oh, and son of God and for
[2:28:42] you are high and lifted

[2:59:57] for those that have been prayed for,
[2:59:59] Father, may you just continue to grow
[3:00:01] that contact inside of them, Lord, and
[3:00:04] that they may come to the reality of the
[3:00:06] living God and to know that we can not
[3:00:09] live by bread alone, but by every word
[3:00:12] that comes out of your mouth. Father, I
[3:00:14] don't want any of us to go out of here
[3:00:16] condemned, but I pray with all my heart,
[3:00:19] Lord.
[3:00:19] May you reach out and touch each and
[3:00:21] every heart that to know that you are
[3:00:24] here present making your word manifested
[3:00:26] every day Lord. Father we may be blind
[3:00:29] and we may not be able to see. I pray
[3:00:31] father that you give us eyesight that we
[3:00:34] may come to the realization that you are
[3:00:36] bringing your word to come to pass
[3:00:38] exactly like you promised it. I pray
[3:00:41] that you just bless our brother Matthew
[3:00:43] Lord this morning. And father may you
[3:00:45] strengthen him for all that is poured
[3:00:48] out, oh Lord. And father that you may
[3:00:50] increase his revelation for your
[3:00:52] people's sake. And Lord, we we come here
[3:00:54] to hear your word. And and I pray that
[3:00:57] that word may have an effect upon us
[3:00:59] this morning. And we may go out of here
[3:01:02] saying that we are better people than
[3:01:04] the way we came in. I pray you protect
[3:01:06] us on the road and you bring us Seth
[3:01:08] back again for this evening service.
[3:01:10] Lord, that our hearts may hunger and
[3:01:12] thirst after you all the days of our
[3:01:15] lives. With without the hunger, Lord, we
[3:01:18] are no different than the guy walking
[3:01:20] down the street, Lord. It's the hunger
[3:01:22] that draws us close to you, Lord. May
[3:01:24] you multiply the hunger this morning,
[3:01:26] that we may go out of here hungering to
[3:01:29] hear, Lord, that the reality of the word
[3:01:31] may become our reality. We love you,
[3:01:34] Lord, and just commit everyone into your
[3:01:36] hands, those that have been prayed for
[3:01:37] and those that lifted up their hands and
[3:01:40] all those that manifested the need to
[3:01:42] you. Father, I believe with all my heart
[3:01:44] that you heard them. We're committed to
[3:01:46] you and we love you and ask those things
[3:01:48] in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[3:01:50] Christ we pray.
