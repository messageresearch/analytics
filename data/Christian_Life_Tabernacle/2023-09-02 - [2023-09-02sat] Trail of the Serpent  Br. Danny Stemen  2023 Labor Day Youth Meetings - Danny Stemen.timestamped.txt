[17:29] in
[17:31] [Music]
[17:33] how many have come with an expectation
[17:35] for God to move
[17:38] [Music]
[17:42] maybe each one of us should look for
[17:45] something for God not only to do for the
[17:47] Youth maybe for your friends family or
[17:49] loved ones
[17:51] but God cares about you
[17:54] I believe God has come here tonight with
[17:56] something specifically
[17:58] he wants to do for you
[18:01] so let's start looking to him and just
[18:03] let the things of the world just move a
[18:06] sign
[18:07] brother Jackson to come and open the
[18:09] Service in prayer
[18:12] we'll also take up our tithes and
[18:14] offerings at this time and
[18:19] let's just keep a great expectation for
[18:22] the move of God
[18:24] in this service and
[18:27] looking forward to what God has
[18:28] [Music]
[18:33] you know when you have a meeting like
[18:34] this
[18:36] God has sent a man hundreds of miles a
[18:38] thousand miles
[18:40] and he doesn't just do it lightly he
[18:42] comes with great expectations
[18:44] and we've set everything aside to come
[18:48] and hear from him let's her in here
[18:50] let's enter in
[18:52] Heavenly Father we come to you tonight
[18:55] though we know that long ago Lord you
[18:58] had brother Danny planned for this
[19:00] weekend
[19:01] Lord and you can take a man from his
[19:03] church and bring him and have a Revival
[19:05] Lord and the people come with
[19:07] expectation
[19:08] Lord there's many people that traveled
[19:10] many miles to come here
[19:12] Lord some to be in Fellowship Lord but
[19:15] ultimately to hear your word
[19:17] father we ask that what brother Danny
[19:19] has on his heart tonight Lord there
[19:21] would be something that he's prepared in
[19:23] his study Lord but you would allow him
[19:25] to go through the scriptures and that
[19:27] you would allow him to walk through each
[19:29] of the pews Lord your Holy Spirit doing
[19:31] the interpretation tonight
[19:33] father we set this building aside the
[19:35] sanctuary
[19:36] or that you could come and feel welcome
[19:38] here
[19:40] father every time that we come with the
[19:42] need you meet us with the great
[19:43] expectation Lord you performed many
[19:45] miracles here Lord you've answered many
[19:48] a prayer requests father that have been
[19:49] spoken to your people Lord we ask that
[19:52] you would do something special tonight
[19:53] Lord that brother Danny would feel at
[19:55] Liberty to go in whichever way he
[19:57] decides father but being Guided by your
[19:59] Holy Spirit
[20:01] Lord we ask that you would bless the
[20:02] tithes of the offering Lord every order
[20:04] of the service be with the musicians

[20:08] could be in rest in your word

[21:02] for service but we had a good time and
[21:04] somebody had such a good time they left
[21:06] their sunglasses and their wallet and
[21:08] and they just didn't care about it so if

[21:18] wallet or glasses or something like that

[21:39] that how there was a Bloodshed and the
[21:42] the only reason we can have what we have

[56:00] for a minister to be after he's prepared
[56:03] things and got ready and then all of a
[56:05] sudden the Lord wants to turn it at
[56:07] another angle and so when he does that
[56:10] you just trust the Lord and amen and
[56:13] just keep walking and so what we started
[56:16] last night we want to continue on today
[56:18] with the help of the Lord so Revelations
[56:20] 12 verse 1.
[56:23] and there appeared a great Wonder in
[56:25] heaven
[56:26] a woman clothed with the sun and the
[56:28] moon under her feet
[56:30] and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars
[56:34] and she being with child cried
[56:37] travailing in birth and pain to be
[56:39] delivered
[56:41] and there appeared another Wonder in
[56:43] heaven
[56:44] and behold a great red dragon having
[56:47] seven heads and ten horns and seven
[56:50] crowns upon his head
[56:52] and his tail
[56:54] drew the third part of the stars of
[56:57] Heaven
[56:58] and did cast them to the Earth
[57:00] and the dragons stood before the woman
[57:03] which is ready to be delivered for to
[57:06] devour her child as soon as it was born
[57:10] and she brought forth a man-child who's
[57:12] to rule All Nations the rod of iron and
[57:14] her child was called up to God into his
[57:17] throne you can be seated
[57:20] may the Lord bless your eating of his
[57:22] word
[57:24] he's speaking about last night of
[57:28] of Isaiah 14 that God had
[57:32] through his Prophet had exposed the
[57:36] spirit that was in this
[57:39] this King this power of Babylon
[57:42] and he didn't call him by the his given
[57:45] name he didn't call him uh by by what he
[57:49] was on Earth he called him the
[57:51] identified that spirit for where it came
[57:55] from
[57:56] and and he called him by the name that
[57:59] had been given to him in heaven
[58:01] and that name was Lucifer and and he
[58:05] began to to say what was in his heart
[58:10] and and to say what his desire was and
[58:13] then he made a proclamation a prophecy
[58:16] and that prophecy was that he would be
[58:19] cast down
[58:20] and that it would come to a place they
[58:22] had realized that he didn't have any
[58:25] more power than any other man
[58:28] amen even though in his lies and his
[58:31] deceit in his tales that he has told he
[58:34] has weakened the Nations his influence
[58:37] has has disrupted homes and disrupted
[58:40] powers and and corrupted everything that
[58:43] he has touched because that's what he is
[58:45] he's a perverter
[58:47] right he's not a Creator he cannot
[58:50] create amen so when the prophet comes
[58:54] amen he comes to expose amen his works
[58:59] he comes to expose where he's at
[59:03] so Isaiah could say when he looked at
[59:06] this King this Babylonian power he could
[59:09] say this power that is in you and he
[59:12] identified him explicitly to be the
[59:15] power of Satan we saw the same thing in
[59:18] Ezekiel when he looked at the prince and
[59:21] he said you've been in Eden
[59:23] I've recognized you and I see where
[59:27] you're at and you begin to describe what
[59:29] he wasn't eating and begin to say the
[59:31] great uh talents that he had in music
[59:34] and everything you see because in heaven
[59:37] Lucifer was the original Archangel of
[59:40] God this enemy that we have amen was an
[59:44] enemy with a position and his position
[59:46] was one to worship God Amen is one to
[59:50] lead the people in a place where it was
[59:53] holy holy Lord God Almighty there are
[59:56] some powerful sort of power in that
[59:59] worship that in his heart something
[1:00:01] began to happen
[1:00:03] that he desired that power
[1:00:06] and the Bible says he was perfect in all
[1:00:09] his ways
[1:00:10] until iniquity was found in him
[1:00:13] but he was a creature of beauty
[1:00:17] amen you would never look at someone
[1:00:19] like that and say there's the serpent
[1:00:20] right
[1:00:21] there's the Dragon
[1:00:23] come on you would never look at
[1:00:26] something like that and and and and make
[1:00:28] him out to be something
[1:00:30] ugly he was beautiful
[1:00:33] and and this is what the spirit was
[1:00:35] wanting amen his people to see that when
[1:00:38] he comes his plans are always in Beauty
[1:00:43] always in something appealing
[1:00:47] and in the appealing is the deception
[1:00:51] because something so beautiful could not
[1:00:53] deceive us could it
[1:00:56] but this is what he was and so I just
[1:00:58] want to describe him a little bit this
[1:01:01] this evening you know if we can take
[1:01:03] away from these services this thing that
[1:01:05] no longer do we have to fear this enemy
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:10] amen amen no longer amen the Bible calls
[1:01:13] him a man
[1:01:15] amen God says I'm not a man
[1:01:20] come on church he says I'm not a man a
[1:01:23] man will lie but I'm not a man
[1:01:26] I want you know the one that has come
[1:01:28] here in this hour the one who is here in
[1:01:31] this meeting is not a man
[1:01:33] he's greater than a man
[1:01:37] he he will not tell you a lie if he
[1:01:41] places a desire in your heart that is
[1:01:43] not a lie it is from God and it's meant
[1:01:47] to be received amen it's meant to be
[1:01:49] filled if he's placed in you that desire
[1:01:51] for the Holy Ghost it's meant to do
[1:01:54] exactly what it is that desire did not
[1:01:57] come from Satan
[1:01:58] come on Church
[1:02:01] Satan's a man God Amen became man
[1:02:07] to take away the power of that man that
[1:02:10] will lie to you he became man so that
[1:02:14] you could stand in the grace amen that
[1:02:17] God has given you in this hour and you
[1:02:19] can stand up and not be afraid you don't
[1:02:22] have to be afraid of suicide you don't
[1:02:24] have to be afraid you're going to fail
[1:02:26] you don't have to be afraid that you'll
[1:02:28] be lost
[1:02:30] hey you can look at me all you want I'm
[1:02:32] going to preach to you
[1:02:33] on Church Satan amen will put a lie over
[1:02:37] you you understand the hour we live in
[1:02:38] I'm in the hour we live in God allowed
[1:02:41] that Pillar of Fire that all these
[1:02:43] prophets have talked about amen Moses
[1:02:45] talked about him Abraham talked about
[1:02:47] him amen all of these prophets talked
[1:02:50] about the pillar of fire but God allowed
[1:02:52] science Amen to take its picture to say
[1:02:56] this is the god do you notice where the
[1:02:59] pillar of fire is it's over the top
[1:03:03] to lead the people
[1:03:05] Prophet said he's come back in this hour
[1:03:07] to lead the people again where did he
[1:03:10] lead them to he led them out of Egypt he
[1:03:14] led them through the Red Sea he led them
[1:03:16] through the Wilderness he led them to
[1:03:19] the promise he placed them in their land
[1:03:22] he didn't bring you here to lose you he
[1:03:25] brought you here to place you
[1:03:31] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:03:33] he brought you here to place you
[1:03:36] so so he allowed this picture to be
[1:03:38] taken
[1:03:40] and then another picture that was taken
[1:03:41] was of the hood of death
[1:03:44] Satan
[1:03:46] his power it was not over their head it
[1:03:49] was over their eyes completely covered
[1:03:53] their head
[1:03:54] one is on top
[1:03:56] to lead
[1:03:58] the other blinds you
[1:04:02] whether it's disease
[1:04:04] whether it's indifference
[1:04:07] misconception
[1:04:09] it is a blindness that comes over you
[1:04:13] now brother Branham said in in his
[1:04:15] ministry we know these things and we
[1:04:17] preach these things because amen first
[1:04:20] amen a prophet announced we can see it
[1:04:23] through the eye
[1:04:24] of a prophet
[1:04:27] before we even experience it we can see
[1:04:31] it through the eye of a prophet
[1:04:33] Jesus said if you receive a prophet in
[1:04:36] the name of a prophet you receive a
[1:04:38] prophet's reward what does that mean
[1:04:40] that means all that God has poured
[1:04:43] through that Prophet is yours amen if
[1:04:46] you can receive it by faith and I want
[1:04:49] you to know it's not going to be your
[1:04:50] faith it's his faith amen that has come
[1:04:53] to you
[1:04:54] this is what Peter confessed that the
[1:04:57] gate beautiful he said it wasn't my
[1:04:58] faith it was by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:01] it was by the power of Jesus Christ it
[1:05:04] was the faith of Jesus Christ that done
[1:05:07] this work this is why God wants your
[1:05:09] body not your ability
[1:05:13] come on church it's not going to be you
[1:05:15] walking around I said look what I'd done
[1:05:16] it's not you trying to get to a special
[1:05:18] man or a special person God is here
[1:05:21] tonight we put our thoughts on this man
[1:05:24] or this person if I can just have him
[1:05:25] lay hands on me or him pray for me or
[1:05:27] him look over me no no no amen the one
[1:05:30] who made us the one who created us it's
[1:05:32] right here tonight he's in this room
[1:05:35] and he'll come by the preaching of the
[1:05:38] word
[1:05:39] he's going to come by the word
[1:05:41] he follows his word
[1:05:45] blessed be the name of the Lord so we
[1:05:47] want we want to when we leave we want to
[1:05:49] leave this place with not a fear of the
[1:05:52] enemy
[1:05:56] and that's revelation
[1:06:00] now brother Adam said that they're
[1:06:03] is a deception that comes in this hour
[1:06:06] and I want to I want to dwell on this
[1:06:07] and this is why I've read Revelations
[1:06:09] 12. I want you to bear with me because I
[1:06:12] want to just take this principle that we
[1:06:14] see in Revelations 12 and apply it to
[1:06:18] this this meaning and and what's
[1:06:20] happening
[1:06:21] amen but
[1:06:23] because of the scripture
[1:06:26] we now Know The Enemy through many
[1:06:29] different titles
[1:06:31] right
[1:06:32] we know him as the serpent we know him
[1:06:35] as a an angel
[1:06:38] an angel of Light he's called a serpent
[1:06:41] he's called an angel of Light he's
[1:06:42] called a roaring lion
[1:06:44] amen he's caught a dragon we read here
[1:06:47] he's he's called a dragon what a dragon
[1:06:49] is nothing but a serpent but it's a
[1:06:51] larger serpent
[1:06:52] he's called the old serpent in the Greek
[1:06:55] he's called he's caught a pollen in the
[1:06:57] Hebrew he's called a badon and they both
[1:06:58] mean Destroyer Destructor
[1:07:00] one who tears down he tears down lives
[1:07:03] he tears down expectations he tears down
[1:07:06] desire he tears down amen
[1:07:09] your desires to come to church
[1:07:12] your desire to enter in he'll tear it
[1:07:15] down and then he'll tell you that
[1:07:17] there's nothing there for you he's a
[1:07:19] destroyer
[1:07:20] he's an old serpent
[1:07:22] he's been around a long time he's been
[1:07:24] called a champion
[1:07:26] which means he's won many battles
[1:07:29] right he's been successful in many
[1:07:31] tactics
[1:07:32] but God wants to expose him
[1:07:34] and and he wants to expose him just not
[1:07:36] in a corporate way but in your life
[1:07:40] and and and so I just want to read a
[1:07:42] number of these things brother Branham
[1:07:43] said he said now every Revival
[1:07:46] every Revival produces twins
[1:07:50] right
[1:07:52] yeah amen my church we have I don't want
[1:07:55] to call it an epidemic it's not an
[1:07:56] epidemic I mean we just it's a lot of
[1:07:58] twins we got five sets of twins in our
[1:08:00] church starting with my boys my boys
[1:08:01] were the first twins my my grandfather
[1:08:03] on my wife's side he called me one day
[1:08:05] many years ago Brother David and he's
[1:08:07] like uh Hey listen I'm preaching on
[1:08:09] twins in my church can you send me a
[1:08:11] picture of your boys
[1:08:13] and I said no
[1:08:15] you're not preaching about my twins
[1:08:20] one's false and one's real
[1:08:23] both of my twins are sons of Gods
[1:08:28] so he laughed and I never sent it
[1:08:31] Hallelujah he moved right on to somebody
[1:08:33] else anyway
[1:08:35] but I want you to think about this
[1:08:36] principle of twins
[1:08:39] because brother Branham points this out
[1:08:42] and and he had said I want to preach on
[1:08:44] the trail of The Serpent and I'm going
[1:08:45] to go back home and doing it and he goes
[1:08:47] and he speaks about twins and and what
[1:08:50] it is he says it's it's just like Cain
[1:08:53] and Abel yeah right we know about Cain
[1:08:57] and Abel they grew up in the same home
[1:09:01] all nourished
[1:09:04] under the same roof
[1:09:06] all hearing
[1:09:09] the same instruction
[1:09:12] it was not able hearing about Jehovah
[1:09:15] and Cain hearing about something else
[1:09:19] they were both under the same teacher
[1:09:23] both under the same environment brother
[1:09:26] Branham said the only difference
[1:09:29] only difference
[1:09:31] two different fathers
[1:09:36] but the same wound
[1:09:39] but two different fathers
[1:09:42] same environment
[1:09:45] two different fathers he said it's just
[1:09:47] like Cain and Abel it's like it's like
[1:09:50] Jacob and Esau
[1:09:53] and then he goes it's like Judas and
[1:09:55] Jesus now we can we can look in the
[1:09:58] scripture we just find this principle
[1:10:00] going everywhere it's like Ishmael
[1:10:05] it's like Ishmael and Isaac even though
[1:10:09] Ishmael did not come from the same womb
[1:10:12] the difference of it was
[1:10:14] Abraham tried to manufacture the promise
[1:10:19] and he was so convinced that what he had
[1:10:22] done was right
[1:10:24] that he told God let Ishmael live before
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:27] he was willing to Forfeit the promise
[1:10:30] for Ishmael he was so willing to accept
[1:10:33] that life of Ishmael and bypass Isaac
[1:10:37] that he said God let him live foot
[1:10:39] before you but you know if God makes a
[1:10:40] promise
[1:10:43] if God makes a promise he is not going
[1:10:46] to change it
[1:10:49] he's not going to reinterpret it he's
[1:10:53] not going to send the prophet back and
[1:10:55] say it again
[1:10:57] come on somebody if God made a promise
[1:11:00] it doesn't matter what man says it
[1:11:02] doesn't matter what the devil says God
[1:11:04] will keep his word now if God promised
[1:11:07] to meet you and to give you an
[1:11:09] experience with him and to give you the
[1:11:11] Holy Ghost he promised it you're here
[1:11:14] the word is being preached he's not
[1:11:17] going to change
[1:11:19] yeah
[1:11:19] right that's it
[1:11:21] now the prophet said the church age book
[1:11:24] he said when the spirit wants to give a
[1:11:25] revelation Satan cannot stop it
[1:11:32] let me say it again when the Holy Spirit
[1:11:35] wants to give a revelation amen this
[1:11:38] Satan cannot stop it he knew everything
[1:11:42] in his power to stop that Revelation
[1:11:44] from striking your heart come on at a
[1:11:47] young age he'll try to stop it because
[1:11:49] he knows what Revelation does to you
[1:11:54] I can tell you what the word says about
[1:11:56] Revelation the word says amen the Gates
[1:11:59] of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:12:02] revelation of who he is
[1:12:06] if you get the Revelation tonight that
[1:12:08] the Lord Jesus Christ is greater than
[1:12:10] your sin has forgiven you he's greater
[1:12:13] than your life that his grace is over
[1:12:15] you tonight if you get the revelation
[1:12:19] Satan cannot stop it
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:24] praise the Lord there's always twins
[1:12:27] the prophet said now don't forget it
[1:12:30] so I think it's important that we don't
[1:12:31] forget it
[1:12:33] so if there's twins that one is
[1:12:36] deceptive right
[1:12:38] and one is true
[1:12:40] brother Brian said there's always twins
[1:12:42] don't forget this little flock
[1:12:44] the church and the last days how many
[1:12:46] agree were in the last day
[1:12:49] he said the church in the last day
[1:12:52] is going to be twins
[1:12:56] so closely to deceive the very elect if
[1:12:58] possible I want you to do me a favor
[1:13:00] tonight
[1:13:03] quit trying to figure out who I'm
[1:13:05] talking about
[1:13:09] I'm not interested in your opinion
[1:13:12] and I'm not interested in who you think
[1:13:15] I'm only interested what the prophet
[1:13:16] said
[1:13:17] and these are spirits I'm not pointing
[1:13:20] at a man I'm putting it a spirit
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:26] and if you realize that God took the
[1:13:28] power of that spirit and brought him
[1:13:31] down
[1:13:32] to a man who would die
[1:13:36] then you realize
[1:13:38] when he exposes it it can't hold you
[1:13:41] anymore
[1:13:43] you know
[1:13:44] when you come in here
[1:13:46] and you're bound I want to I want to say
[1:13:49] this I don't say it while you're quiet
[1:13:52] you're bound by something weaker than
[1:13:55] you
[1:14:04] but somehow
[1:14:06] it's convinced you
[1:14:08] to give up
[1:14:10] that's how deceptive
[1:14:13] the spirit is
[1:14:15] it's a spirit that convinces you
[1:14:18] of another angle
[1:14:21] he said it's going to be so close I want
[1:14:22] you to listen
[1:14:24] he says it's Matthew 24 24 he says it's
[1:14:27] a Pentecostal move
[1:14:29] again
[1:14:31] I want you
[1:14:33] to not give your opinion
[1:14:35] it's a Pentecostal move well what is a
[1:14:37] Pentecostal move
[1:14:38] Pentecostal move is the promise of the
[1:14:42] Holy Spirit
[1:14:45] that's Pentecost
[1:14:47] original Pentecost is the promise of the
[1:14:50] Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the birth
[1:14:53] so now Satan will deceive where the
[1:14:58] birth is
[1:15:02] this is why he says it's a Pentecostal
[1:15:04] move and these twins are so close
[1:15:08] and they're both in the same framework
[1:15:11] and the prophet says in the church age
[1:15:13] book he says that if the church can get
[1:15:16] the revelation
[1:15:19] of the two Spirits within the framework
[1:15:22] of the church
[1:15:24] discern it and withstand it
[1:15:29] right discern it and withstand it again
[1:15:32] I'm not wanting your opinion
[1:15:35] and I'm not wanting your Grudge it's so
[1:15:38] easy to to have a grudge or an opinion
[1:15:40] about somebody put a label on me no you
[1:15:43] know we live in the hour of labels and
[1:15:44] politics and I hate political Devils
[1:15:47] amen that call themselves religious
[1:15:52] and they want to label you and they want
[1:15:53] to call you names and if we just put a
[1:15:55] name over you we don't have to bother
[1:15:56] with you oh I'm so glad to serve a God
[1:15:59] that he would go behind the labels well
[1:16:00] there's a woman called an adultery and
[1:16:02] he says well let me go talk to her
[1:16:04] right right
[1:16:09] some of you wouldn't darken the doors of
[1:16:11] these places to help a lost one and I'm
[1:16:13] not interested in recycling people
[1:16:16] come on he came to seek and save that
[1:16:19] which is lost
[1:16:21] you might have your opinion of that
[1:16:22] woman at the well and you're like hey
[1:16:24] you know what before before the
[1:16:26] disciples were converted brother Billy
[1:16:28] God had to send them away to get
[1:16:29] groceries
[1:16:31] so he could talk to this woman at the
[1:16:33] well
[1:16:34] hey you go get groceries because you're
[1:16:36] not going to understand what I'm doing
[1:16:38] but this woman needs help there's
[1:16:40] somebody in here needs help that's the
[1:16:43] one we're interested in I'm not
[1:16:45] interested in your religion
[1:16:51] I'm tired of religion I came out of
[1:16:54] religion
[1:16:55] I want life
[1:16:58] and don't you tell me what life sounds
[1:17:00] like
[1:17:02] life is the one that gets down in your
[1:17:05] soul
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:07] changes you from death into life there's
[1:17:10] a voice inside of you he called it a
[1:17:14] still small voice
[1:17:15] amen hallelujah now whisper comes in
[1:17:18] your ear says give up that voice says
[1:17:20] but you're mine
[1:17:24] [Applause]
[1:17:31] so much like the real thing to see the
[1:17:33] very elective possible and later on if I
[1:17:35] get the chance I want to explain
[1:17:38] how that election comes
[1:17:41] here brother man I'm talking about
[1:17:42] deception
[1:17:44] and election
[1:17:47] it's going to deceive them because it's
[1:17:49] almost like the same thing two fathers
[1:17:52] same mother same church same movement
[1:17:57] same thing the betting ground is the
[1:17:59] same where the word false
[1:18:01] but one of them is perverted
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:07] one of them is a perversion because it's
[1:18:09] a wrong father and he's stirring people
[1:18:10] to an organization
[1:18:16] instead of the word
[1:18:18] it's a wrong father Stern him to an
[1:18:20] organization organization is a party
[1:18:22] thought
[1:18:24] group thinking
[1:18:31] it's an organization instead of the word
[1:18:33] it's the wrong father he said well we're
[1:18:34] not an organization but it's the spirit
[1:18:36] he's talk enough
[1:18:38] it's a cane move you say this is a weird
[1:18:40] youth meeting what are you
[1:18:50] he said I go home I'm going to preach on
[1:18:52] the trail of the serpent the beast at
[1:18:53] the beginning and the Beast at the end
[1:18:56] and Trail him right through the Bible
[1:18:58] what a message
[1:19:00] that can find him
[1:19:02] everywhere
[1:19:05] that exposes him we know what our
[1:19:08] message is
[1:19:09] come on church we don't need to
[1:19:11] re-explained we know what our message is
[1:19:13] the center of our gospel is Revelations
[1:19:16] 10. we know it
[1:19:18] come on Church
[1:19:21] and that message
[1:19:23] it wasn't William branham's
[1:19:27] against my better judgment I wanted to
[1:19:29] be a Trapper yeah
[1:19:31] but it's the will of my father
[1:19:34] what's the will of my father you're the
[1:19:36] will of my father
[1:19:37] was his will that this message would go
[1:19:40] forth
[1:19:41] because it's the message as it goes over
[1:19:44] the people
[1:19:46] even a prophet Amen in his own thinking
[1:19:49] thinks is it over is Mercy over is there
[1:19:52] more look at all the people that are
[1:19:53] here when he was thinking that you
[1:19:55] weren't even here but Mercy was not over
[1:19:59] Mercy is not over because the message is
[1:20:03] going forth
[1:20:05] and it's going to go over that life oh
[1:20:07] we might have to send some preachers off
[1:20:09] to get groceries
[1:20:14] [Applause]
[1:20:19] that woman who's tried she's married
[1:20:20] five times and the one she's living with
[1:20:22] is not her own come on she's giving up
[1:20:25] hope amen the law said she should die
[1:20:29] but God rich and mercy said I am not
[1:20:33] done with you yet because amen Satan is
[1:20:36] done he's wrote his life over yours he's
[1:20:39] convinced you to give up amen but you
[1:20:42] come from the seed of the right father
[1:20:45] and where that seed is Satan can't hide
[1:20:48] it from God
[1:20:50] yeah hey man you know we got off the
[1:20:54] plane
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:57] and I don't know where sister
[1:20:59] Gabriel is she says welcome to the
[1:21:01] concrete jungle
[1:21:04] you know concrete this place didn't used
[1:21:06] to be concrete there's life there was
[1:21:07] grass there were Seeds of Life all
[1:21:10] laying there and all this concrete's
[1:21:11] poured out you know you can walk around
[1:21:13] and oh it can be thick but also it's
[1:21:15] cracked here and cracked here's a
[1:21:17] you can reach down and just rip that
[1:21:20] grass out because it's so weak in itself
[1:21:23] the grass is not strong because it's
[1:21:25] grass You're Not Strong amen because
[1:21:28] you're human amen but it was the drawing
[1:21:31] power amen that is it moved it that
[1:21:34] concrete could not stop it came in the
[1:21:37] draw in power went down through what had
[1:21:39] been laid over its life
[1:21:41] that whatever was laid over was a lie it
[1:21:45] could not stop it from coming forth and
[1:21:47] expressing
[1:21:49] the power of the seed that is inside of
[1:21:53] it and if you're a Son of God Amen the
[1:21:56] word comes over you something in you
[1:21:58] will say Amen to the word amen it's not
[1:22:01] the condition it's the seed for when the
[1:22:05] seed responds to the word the condition
[1:22:07] has to give way
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:12] speaking to someone in that condition
[1:22:18] it's a
[1:22:19] that's what prophet said this is like
[1:22:21] Judas and Jesus this is this close
[1:22:26] he said even the Holy Ghost
[1:22:30] in the Antichrist
[1:22:33] s are twins
[1:22:36] the Antichrist don't look like the Pope
[1:22:42] with all their images
[1:22:45] the Antichrist
[1:22:46] looks like the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] but he's not
[1:23:06] so you keep in mind
[1:23:09] these descriptions of Lucifer he's a
[1:23:11] serpent he's an old serpent
[1:23:14] he's a dragon
[1:23:15] the scripture he read to you in
[1:23:16] Revelation 12 he's a dragon he's much
[1:23:18] larger than the serpent
[1:23:21] but it's the same one
[1:23:23] this is Satan
[1:23:25] in his power working through religious
[1:23:28] and political powers
[1:23:30] and he's there
[1:23:33] standing in front of the woman
[1:23:36] who's getting ready to bring forth the
[1:23:38] child
[1:23:39] and he's determined to kill that child
[1:23:42] at Birth
[1:23:45] this is the principle that I'm talking
[1:23:46] about
[1:23:48] is that's what he wants to do
[1:23:50] is kill it at Birth
[1:23:54] so he stands before it
[1:23:56] do you realize
[1:23:58] that is that a church service like this
[1:24:00] is both natural and Supernatural
[1:24:04] I'm looking through senses see feel
[1:24:07] taste smelling here
[1:24:08] you are doing the same thing you're
[1:24:10] looking back at me you're responding
[1:24:13] we're contacting one another through
[1:24:15] these senses but these senses are not
[1:24:18] even made
[1:24:19] to contact God so we have the natural
[1:24:22] and the supernatural that is here
[1:24:25] amen it's faith that contacts him
[1:24:29] amen and his faith is here so if the
[1:24:32] natural can move out of the side and let
[1:24:35] Faith begin to see what the natural
[1:24:37] cannot see
[1:24:39] amen it brings that word amen into
[1:24:42] effect in your life even before you see
[1:24:45] it before you feel it I mean everybody
[1:24:47] wants to feel it everybody wants to see
[1:24:50] it but that's not what's going to
[1:24:51] impress God Amen it's when you can
[1:24:54] believe it amen amen I don't want to be
[1:24:57] a Thomas here unless I see it or feel it
[1:24:59] I'm not going to believe it unless I put
[1:25:01] my hand in his side I'm not going to
[1:25:03] believe it but there's going to be some
[1:25:04] Gentiles amen say you don't even have to
[1:25:07] come to my house just speak the word and
[1:25:10] I'll believe it
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:14] because his word means so much to this
[1:25:18] wonder how many today are impressed with
[1:25:21] the word that's in their midst
[1:25:24] she was impressed with it amen you would
[1:25:30] amen we'd be like the bereans who are
[1:25:32] more noble than those of thessalonica
[1:25:34] who search the Scriptures Daily to see
[1:25:37] if these things were sore or not it
[1:25:39] never said scope the internets live
[1:25:42] stream every church just search the
[1:25:44] scripture look and see don't you know
[1:25:47] they're trying to prove the message
[1:25:49] wrong through the internet amen but it's
[1:25:51] by the scripture God never sent the
[1:25:54] internet he sent the scripture and it's
[1:25:56] by the scripture we know these things
[1:25:58] are true
[1:25:59] hey that's hey man
[1:26:08] you know our problem is
[1:26:10] we don't have enough pioneering spirits
[1:26:14] Hardy
[1:26:16] and stick it out
[1:26:18] it's not to the one who runs the fastest
[1:26:22] 20 endures
[1:26:24] how do you think these churches started
[1:26:28] but I had to lay a burden
[1:26:30] lay a burden on brother David's heart
[1:26:32] move to Dallas and it didn't start like
[1:26:34] this
[1:26:35] start like that in our place in Sarasota
[1:26:38] started with my dad amen he had been
[1:26:41] converted and he'd come to when he come
[1:26:42] to the Lord amen he hears a knock on the
[1:26:45] wall in his in his in his bedroom and
[1:26:48] it's knocking and it says feed my sheep
[1:26:50] feed my Lambs
[1:26:52] Lord is that you come back the next
[1:26:54] night feed my sheep feed my Lambs he'd
[1:26:56] go on the job he was in construction and
[1:26:58] he said I'd hear knocking everywhere and
[1:27:01] I'd go around and check the doors I
[1:27:02] checked the windows
[1:27:04] and there was nobody there and I finally
[1:27:06] said Lord if that's you
[1:27:08] you show me what to do I'll do it he
[1:27:10] said the knocking stopped
[1:27:14] the Lord laid on his heart
[1:27:17] go to Florida
[1:27:19] where he had went around testifying this
[1:27:20] message was a cult
[1:27:25] go back to Florida
[1:27:27] he said Lord if that's you he said I'll
[1:27:28] go there for two weeks he says Lord I'm
[1:27:30] going to lay a fleece out if that's you
[1:27:32] I will be invited into people's houses
[1:27:34] to talk about the word without me asking
[1:27:38] said every night for two weeks he was
[1:27:39] invited to people's houses to talk about
[1:27:41] the word without him asking
[1:27:43] he got the message my mother said Lord
[1:27:46] if that's you amen let this house sell
[1:27:49] without advertisement in two weeks the
[1:27:51] house was sold
[1:27:52] without advertisement God wanted him
[1:27:54] down there but he never made it easy on
[1:27:57] him if you're not a Pioneer in spirit
[1:27:58] you're not going to be able to make it
[1:28:00] things get hard you're going to run
[1:28:02] ain't nobody sit there and we lived in a
[1:28:05] hotel for a couple weeks and I remember
[1:28:06] it as as a young boy and and he told the
[1:28:09] Lord he said Lord I'll live anywhere in
[1:28:11] Sarasota but I won't live in pinecraft
[1:28:13] Pine craft is a Mennonite Amish area
[1:28:15] where he testified he was a cult and so
[1:28:16] for the next 30 years we lived in
[1:28:18] pinecraft because you don't tell the
[1:28:20] Lord where you're going to live
[1:28:22] because when God places something on
[1:28:25] your heart it's not for you it's for
[1:28:27] them
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:29] and we need some pioneering Spirit some
[1:28:31] people that amen when the going gets
[1:28:33] rough can you imagine a man standing his
[1:28:36] congregation was us kids
[1:28:38] Hallelujah
[1:28:41] and that was Dad
[1:28:43] and Dad preached to us for years with
[1:28:46] the Revelation that God had sent him
[1:28:47] there
[1:28:48] his wife
[1:28:50] and his three kids four kids
[1:28:52] later five kids
[1:28:54] he preached to us in the in the room in
[1:28:57] the living room and that was the church
[1:29:01] but if it hadn't been a pioneering
[1:29:02] Spirit to know God has called me here
[1:29:05] he wouldn't have stuck it out
[1:29:08] right you see me it wasn't for him it
[1:29:09] was for you
[1:29:12] we need people that can stick it out
[1:29:17] what you don't feel like it or not you
[1:29:19] know that he called you
[1:29:21] you know that he spoke to you that you
[1:29:23] have an anchor God has sent me here he
[1:29:25] has brought me to this place and I'm
[1:29:27] going to stick it out because his
[1:29:29] purpose is greater than my purpose his
[1:29:31] desire is greater than my desire his
[1:29:34] will is not my will but my will must be
[1:29:37] his will
[1:29:38] Lord not my will but thine be done I
[1:29:40] wonder if we could pray that tonight not
[1:29:42] my will but thine be done in my life not
[1:29:45] what not what I want not my education
[1:29:48] not my career
[1:29:50] amen but your will
[1:29:56] Hallelujah
[1:29:58] just keep in mind now let's see
[1:30:01] brother Branham announced that we're in
[1:30:02] Satan's Eden
[1:30:06] and that old serpent
[1:30:09] through his political powers and his
[1:30:11] religious powers
[1:30:12] has again challenged
[1:30:15] the creation of God
[1:30:18] even changing what a man or a woman is
[1:30:22] changing them in their genders
[1:30:25] you can choose
[1:30:27] be whatever you want
[1:30:29] whatever you think and he comes in a
[1:30:32] confusion
[1:30:34] and he anoints the people with this
[1:30:35] confusion and he gets them to believe a
[1:30:39] lie that there's somebody that they're
[1:30:40] not
[1:30:42] right you understand this is the hour
[1:30:45] amen the people are so confused
[1:30:49] but he's here to show you
[1:30:51] the holy spirit is here to show you
[1:30:54] your identity
[1:30:57] in him
[1:30:59] brother man said I wish you could stand
[1:31:01] with me and see the faces of the people
[1:31:02] when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:31:04] exposed
[1:31:06] listen
[1:31:08] it isn't the people that I'm talking
[1:31:09] about
[1:31:11] it's that Satan has got a hold in their
[1:31:13] lives through sin
[1:31:16] and indifference and disease notice sin
[1:31:20] which is unbelief indifference you know
[1:31:23] we'll go to the services I I mainly came
[1:31:25] because of the volleyball but I'll come
[1:31:27] in here tonight you know and I'll sit
[1:31:28] here but you're indifferent to what the
[1:31:30] Lord will do
[1:31:31] you're under end disease he said Satan
[1:31:33] gets a hold of people's lives this way
[1:31:35] but you should see their faces when
[1:31:37] Satan knows he's going to be exposed
[1:31:42] the most peculiar changes come over
[1:31:45] their faces
[1:31:46] over their countenances he says these
[1:31:49] changes is because Satan is afraid
[1:31:57] if we could just change his position in
[1:31:59] this room tonight to not one of power
[1:32:02] over you but to one a fear of you
[1:32:08] amen he is afraid because he knows that
[1:32:11] the spirit of God is about to let the
[1:32:14] people know of his works that's why he
[1:32:17] hates these meetings so much
[1:32:19] when names are called and diseases are
[1:32:22] revealed Satan's hate hate it hates it
[1:32:25] what is it it's not mind reading it's
[1:32:27] not telepathy nor is it witchcraft it is
[1:32:31] a revelation
[1:32:32] of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:37] the scripture I read to you in
[1:32:39] Revelation 12.
[1:32:41] brother bam said that she's clothed in
[1:32:43] the sun he said it's the dispensation of
[1:32:45] Grace the woman clothed in the sun is a
[1:32:47] dispensation of grace and the Moon is
[1:32:49] under her feet he says it was the law as
[1:32:51] it was passing away in the crown of 12
[1:32:53] stars is the apostolic Doctrine he said
[1:32:56] it is the church bringing forth Jesus
[1:32:58] Christ so notice the position the of the
[1:33:01] Dragon is to stand before the church and
[1:33:04] stop the birth of the Holy One
[1:33:09] right
[1:33:12] when Jesus was born we saw it amen there
[1:33:14] was a proclamation
[1:33:16] issued by the Roman Empire to sway all
[1:33:19] the children from two years down because
[1:33:21] we've missed him
[1:33:25] be missing but we got to kill him
[1:33:28] why he's a king
[1:33:30] whenever a king is born it's a threat to
[1:33:32] the current King on the throne
[1:33:35] whenever a king is born it is a threat
[1:33:38] to the current King on the throne
[1:33:43] so we gotta kill him
[1:33:44] we got to stop his influence
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:51] how
[1:33:52] in the Garden of Eden and I'm gonna I'm
[1:33:54] gonna say some things that are familiar
[1:33:55] to you
[1:33:58] and that is we see a serpent
[1:34:01] he's more subtle the Bible says in all
[1:34:04] the beasts of the field
[1:34:06] he had characteristics
[1:34:08] that Satan took advantage of Satan knew
[1:34:11] what to use
[1:34:13] now Satan is such a person now he may
[1:34:16] not be stronger than God but what he is
[1:34:19] is very cunning
[1:34:21] and what he does is he plans
[1:34:24] by studying
[1:34:28] we read about Napoleon who was a great
[1:34:30] warrior and great General before he'd
[1:34:34] ever come into a country he would take
[1:34:35] the map of that country and lay it down
[1:34:37] and he'd look at every Creek and every
[1:34:38] bridge and he would look at every field
[1:34:40] and he would look at everything and he'd
[1:34:42] plot a strategy of how he's going to
[1:34:43] take that country Over Now The Prophet
[1:34:46] says Satan studies you
[1:34:48] what do you think about that he studies
[1:34:51] you
[1:34:52] you say I'm not important then you must
[1:34:54] be if he studies you
[1:34:56] he studies your life and how why does he
[1:34:59] study it he wants to see how you use the
[1:35:03] word
[1:35:05] how you use the word
[1:35:11] he's going to study you he's going to
[1:35:13] study your nature he's going to study
[1:35:15] your family tree he's going to plot out
[1:35:17] your life he's going to study the
[1:35:19] weaknesses of your flesh amen he's going
[1:35:22] to study the Tendencies of the parents
[1:35:24] and of the grandparents he's going to
[1:35:26] study do they have anger issues is there
[1:35:29] nervousness in this family is there
[1:35:31] cancer in this family
[1:35:33] come on church is there abuse in this
[1:35:37] family is there this and this and he's
[1:35:39] going to study it because he's going to
[1:35:42] use it over your life and his whole
[1:35:45] purpose is to study how you use the word
[1:35:49] because he has to stop the birth
[1:35:53] because if anybody knows the quotes it's
[1:35:55] Satan
[1:35:57] don't think because you know the quotes
[1:35:59] you got the Holy Ghost anybody knows who
[1:36:02] knows the word it's Satan he he knows it
[1:36:05] the difference between Satan and Jesus
[1:36:07] is Satan knows the word and Jesus is the
[1:36:10] word so when Satan says it he's saying
[1:36:13] it to argue with it but when Jesus
[1:36:15] saying it it's saying it because it's
[1:36:17] him
[1:36:20] he said I know you're tired if you need
[1:36:22] to go get groceries get them but let the
[1:36:23] woman at the well sit here because we
[1:36:25] need to preach tonight we need to have
[1:36:27] some Pioneers in here because we're
[1:36:30] going to get through to that person come
[1:36:32] on
[1:36:35] one of the scariest things in the Pulpit
[1:36:37] is to watch the preacher take a drink
[1:36:39] because you know he's just getting fuel
[1:36:46] praise the name of the Lord so he's
[1:36:47] study in your life
[1:36:49] well you just I mean it's gone it's good
[1:36:52] time to be you know the best time
[1:36:53] brother Andrew to be transparent is in
[1:36:54] church
[1:36:56] be honest
[1:36:59] amen a lot of people they come up now
[1:37:01] you know I just want to be right I just
[1:37:02] want to be right with God I just you
[1:37:04] know I just want but there's things in
[1:37:05] their life that Satan has studied and
[1:37:06] he's held up put a hold over that and
[1:37:09] they don't want to say what it is so he
[1:37:12] studied their strategy they're going to
[1:37:13] be honest with it
[1:37:14] are they going to say it
[1:37:17] are they going to talk about are they
[1:37:18] going to expose it so he just said nice
[1:37:20] you just go on out there young people
[1:37:22] you're just going up there you you pray
[1:37:24] cry a while but don't confess
[1:37:29] and if you think amen that what you do
[1:37:32] up here is going to change you without
[1:37:34] confession you're wrong
[1:37:40] brother said all your prayers all your
[1:37:42] fastings
[1:37:45] will not do anything with God
[1:37:48] the only way you'll know you're
[1:37:49] overcoming is in the word
[1:37:53] come on
[1:37:55] so Satan wants to transplant
[1:37:59] he wants to change the formula
[1:38:04] because he studied you
[1:38:06] he knows what makes you excited and what
[1:38:09] doesn't
[1:38:11] how's the Dallas Cowboys doing oh let me
[1:38:13] tell you man this year we're going to
[1:38:15] win the Super Bowl you're going to
[1:38:16] church

[1:38:22] favorite you know
[1:38:24] foreign
[1:38:26] who's the quarterback of the Cowboys
[1:38:29] Everybody's scared to death
[1:38:32] I bet you these boys could tell you
[1:38:34] see he studies you
[1:38:42] you know I look over a congregation we
[1:38:44] watch Him worship Him raise their hands
[1:38:46] but I wonder behind that hand is how
[1:38:48] many unconfessed sin
[1:38:50] no why did I even say that
[1:38:53] let's get happy
[1:38:58] you see he stands before the woman
[1:39:04] she moves over here he moves
[1:39:06] he's standing before her
[1:39:08] because I've got to stop her from
[1:39:11] fulfilling the word
[1:39:14] he knew that the birth of this child
[1:39:19] he knew that the birth of this child
[1:39:22] was his defeat
[1:39:24] his total absolute defeat
[1:39:29] he studies you
[1:39:33] he knows my family he knows my family
[1:39:35] tree how many has ever done that
[1:39:37] ancestry.com thing
[1:39:40] just learn
[1:39:42] to you
[1:39:44] anybody else want to be honest
[1:39:48] good now it's coming
[1:39:52] I've done it because my wife made me
[1:39:55] she wanted to know where I came from I
[1:39:58] tried to tell her
[1:40:03] you know when you look at your ancestors
[1:40:05] a lot of times somebody told you you're
[1:40:07] from here and you're from there and
[1:40:09] you're from this place and you're from
[1:40:10] that place and then you you go
[1:40:14] and look at where you came from and it
[1:40:17] I'm not from there
[1:40:19] he said I was from over here but I'm
[1:40:21] from over here
[1:40:25] Satan studies your family tree that way
[1:40:27] you know I heard all my life I was
[1:40:29] German
[1:40:31] so I thought I have to act like them
[1:40:37] all right I am thinking of it
[1:40:43] I'm sorry uh
[1:40:46] just the way it is you know I I'm German
[1:40:48] so I gotta be that way
[1:40:50] well I'm a Mennonite I must be German

[1:41:03] you know some of you need to take a
[1:41:06] birth test
[1:41:10] find out where you're from
[1:41:12] because I could have lived all my life
[1:41:14] thinking I'm I have a Heritage in the
[1:41:16] men of that church and I'm German

[1:42:01] had to be like my family he told me my
[1:42:04] family tree was in the stemens and in
[1:42:06] the Goldens and it ended over here and
[1:42:09] it started over there come on buddy and
[1:42:11] it come over there but then hallelujah
[1:42:14] I begin to read the word and it was
[1:42:17] another birth test amen and that birth
[1:42:20] has said in the beginning was the word
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:25] God and the Word was God and then I
[1:42:30] turned a little bit over to Ephesians 1.

[1:42:53] have to act like a German I don't have
[1:42:55] to think like a German I don't have to
[1:42:57] conduct myself like a German I have
[1:43:00] another father

[1:43:06] stay under that father that tells you
[1:43:08] you have to live under abuse live with
[1:43:10] suicide live with these lies you have
[1:43:14] another father
[1:43:15] [Applause]
[1:43:17] don't like this don't worry about it I'm
[1:43:19] running out of here
[1:43:22] well Glory Brother John
[1:43:25] why I found out something else funny
[1:43:29] my little sister
[1:43:32] blonde headed blue-eyed
[1:43:34] took the test and found out she's part
[1:43:36] Nigerian
[1:43:39] somebody's lying
[1:43:46] I said somebody's lying
[1:43:49] yeah come on that's right oh how the
[1:43:53] devil wants us to get confused it's the
[1:43:56] trail of the serpent
[1:43:58] you don't have to live under his
[1:44:00] influence here anymore I say unto you in
[1:44:03] the name of the Lord amen for his
[1:44:05] promise is unto you and unto your
[1:44:08] children and even as many as the Lord
[1:44:10] untouchable
[1:44:13] that's your father
[1:44:17] thank you Lord
[1:44:24] he was a serpent
[1:44:28] he went from this great singer
[1:44:33] he went from this great singer in heaven
[1:44:36] mother Brown said his tail
[1:44:38] and we know that this red dragon
[1:44:41] we're going to talk about him for a
[1:44:42] minute because he's describing him
[1:44:44] he's a red dragon he's seeing him
[1:44:47] John's looking at him he says there's a
[1:44:49] dread Dragon we know it's symbols
[1:44:51] before he'd been a serpent
[1:44:54] but it never described him with color
[1:44:59] he never said what the color of the
[1:45:01] serpent was
[1:45:05] but now he gives a description
[1:45:07] calls him a red dragon
[1:45:10] because he's identified with something
[1:45:16] he's identified with one of his twins
[1:45:23] and one of his children his name was
[1:45:25] Esau
[1:45:30] he came out and he's red and he's hairy
[1:45:33] and they caught him Esau because he's
[1:45:35] red but that's not what made him eat him
[1:45:40] his name was changed
[1:45:44] when the birthright came in
[1:45:46] yes and in a time of pressure
[1:45:49] he wanted soup
[1:45:53] he wanted what his passion desired
[1:45:58] right instead of what God had promised
[1:46:02] God said before he's ever born I hated
[1:46:05] him and the reason I hated him is
[1:46:07] because he took my promise and he
[1:46:10] cheapened my promise and made it
[1:46:12] something physical
[1:46:13] right right
[1:46:16] oh my God made it a bowl of soup you can
[1:46:19] eat it when I feel like it
[1:46:22] if it's a Birthright you can't ever get
[1:46:23] away from it
[1:46:26] Amen brother Jonathan you'll never run
[1:46:28] farther than it ask Jacob when you get
[1:46:30] the chance
[1:46:33] got to show up
[1:46:36] show up in your dreams
[1:46:38] show up in your backsliding yeah
[1:46:41] when you run and get so far from God now
[1:46:44] you're going to end up in a place and
[1:46:46] you're going to try to sleep it off
[1:46:48] God will appear to you
[1:46:50] you know where that happened to him it
[1:46:53] happened to him at Bethel
[1:46:55] and he took a stone and he laid on it
[1:46:57] the the Jewish Jewish history says it
[1:46:59] was actually a stone that had come off
[1:47:01] the altar that his father Abraham built
[1:47:04] when he first entered into Canaan you
[1:47:07] know what our grandfathers have built
[1:47:09] and our forefathers have built we start
[1:47:10] treating them like they're pillows
[1:47:13] we sleep on it
[1:47:15] was actually meant to worship
[1:47:18] and he was sleeping on it and God
[1:47:20] appeared to him and he saw the latter
[1:47:23] Angels ascending and descending did I do
[1:47:26] that right
[1:47:27] amen is going up and down he said God
[1:47:30] appeared to him
[1:47:32] he said I've remembered my promise
[1:47:36] Father Abraham your father Isaac and
[1:47:39] I'll not leave you
[1:47:43] not leave you
[1:47:44] this is a man who the church had tried
[1:47:47] to give him the birthright and it didn't
[1:47:48] work
[1:47:50] you see you can't get the birthright
[1:47:52] from the church
[1:47:54] you got to get it from him
[1:47:58] you see the mother the mother had
[1:48:01] already sold him listen I know your
[1:48:03] brother's in line see the church can
[1:48:04] lose faith
[1:48:06] because God had already told her
[1:48:09] that it's the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:48:11] younger
[1:48:13] he's going to get the birthright he'd
[1:48:14] already promised it
[1:48:17] but she couldn't hold on she couldn't be
[1:48:19] a pioneer
[1:48:21] so Satan used their affections
[1:48:24] because Isaac had his favorite and
[1:48:27] she had her favorite and that's a
[1:48:30] problem in a Christian home
[1:48:33] when you have your favorites
[1:48:38] and so
[1:48:39] Esau had the ear of his father
[1:48:42] Jacob had the ear of his mother
[1:48:45] and she knew that Isaac was wanting to
[1:48:48] bless Esau
[1:48:50] give him the promise
[1:48:52] she runs into Esau
[1:48:54] you know last night you were Moses
[1:48:56] today your Esau praise the Lord I'm not
[1:48:59] asking you to take off your shoes if you
[1:49:01] knew what was under there you'd think
[1:49:03] man Hallelujah Eagle socks
[1:49:12] she said
[1:49:16] Esau is going to get the blessing from
[1:49:18] your father
[1:49:21] but I know how to make the soup that he
[1:49:23] likes
[1:49:25] I'll make the soup for you
[1:49:29] you see when the church thinks it can
[1:49:31] make the soup
[1:49:35] you got a problem because this is not
[1:49:37] produced by the church we're only here
[1:49:39] to bring what we have in US
[1:49:46] and she says and I know where his
[1:49:48] clothes are
[1:49:50] so
[1:49:52] what in the world you've gotten that
[1:49:53] Puppet Man it weighs 20 pounds
[1:50:00] Brother David aren't you glad that I
[1:50:03] didn't ask for your coat
[1:50:10] you like this how does it look on me
[1:50:13] come on
[1:50:15] come on
[1:50:17] so now
[1:50:18] the mother church has fixed me up in my
[1:50:21] brother's coat and I'm going to go get
[1:50:23] the blessing
[1:50:26] with what he wears
[1:50:28] you see we try to imitate one another
[1:50:32] and think we got it
[1:50:38] I smell like him
[1:50:43] come on here's a blind prophet here's up
[1:50:46] now I'm changing now you're a blind
[1:50:48] prophet it is he just is a great night
[1:50:52] there's a blind prophet
[1:50:54] he can't see me
[1:50:56] but he can feel me
[1:50:59] and he can smell me
[1:51:01] oh yes this is him
[1:51:04] this is him
[1:51:07] even a prophet was deceived
[1:51:14] and he gave him a blessing
[1:51:17] young people don't ever think
[1:51:20] that you have to act like someone else
[1:51:32] this actually fits this is scary
[1:51:37] this fits me
[1:51:39] it's like the holy spirit in the
[1:51:41] Antichrist
[1:51:45] it fits but it's not mine
[1:51:50] hey you glad I didn't wear your coat
[1:51:53] Hallelujah
[1:51:55] you see God doesn't want you to act
[1:52:00] to talk to be like someone else he
[1:52:05] doesn't want me to preach like Brother
[1:52:06] David he don't want Brother David to
[1:52:08] preach like me he don't want any of
[1:52:10] these preachers to act like me neither
[1:52:12] does he want me to act like them and so
[1:52:14] he gives me my own coat it's the same
[1:52:17] code everybody will get but it's his
[1:52:19] Spirit on an individual vessel it's his
[1:52:23] coat not my brother's coat
[1:52:27] hello
[1:52:29] you know I've used this example many
[1:52:31] many times
[1:52:32] people deceive themselves to think if if
[1:52:35] they got to act like somebody else they
[1:52:37] must have it yeah right that's right if
[1:52:40] I act like somebody else I'll get it
[1:52:42] because you know I know they got it
[1:52:44] so if I act like them I'll get it he
[1:52:46] didn't ask you to act like he don't want
[1:52:48] me to act like you right right come on
[1:52:50] Brother come on Church let's all sing
[1:52:53] together tonight
[1:52:54] Hallelujah we love the Lord I'm almost
[1:52:57] sounding like you you need do you need
[1:53:00] your crease cut I'll cut them for you
[1:53:03] yeah we're not supposed to be like one
[1:53:06] another
[1:53:09] you see the Holy Spirit he likes to use
[1:53:12] this example because I remember one time
[1:53:14] I was I was out in India and I was I
[1:53:16] used this and I was attracted over to
[1:53:18] these bunch of ministers sitting over
[1:53:19] there and there's a guy sitting right in
[1:53:21] the front he was big and tall he had a
[1:53:24] real shiny suit
[1:53:25] real shiny he's sitting there and he's
[1:53:28] looking at me and I'm preaching this and
[1:53:29] I took this example and said here give
[1:53:31] me your quote and you're going to be the
[1:53:33] blind prophet and I took I said now
[1:53:34] bless me father bless me father I know
[1:53:36] before him had him put his hand on me
[1:53:37] and I said bless me father bless me and
[1:53:39] and as I begin to do that now he never
[1:53:41] looked at me like he was happy to be
[1:53:43] there at all he was sitting there and he
[1:53:44] was staring at me like he was scared to
[1:53:45] death my daughter what in the world this
[1:53:46] guy he's a strange believer you know he
[1:53:49] should be saying Amen to this because
[1:53:50] it's it's a good example and he wasn't
[1:53:52] saying amen and he was looking more
[1:53:54] scared and as we say in Florida more
[1:53:55] scared her and more scared her and more
[1:53:57] scared and he's looking like that and
[1:53:58] I'm saying you know God doesn't want you
[1:54:00] to follow a a blind prophet's blessing
[1:54:02] and and wear someone else's coat and
[1:54:04] he's looking at and there's this young
[1:54:06] minister in the back he says hallelujah
[1:54:08] hallelujah hallelujah and this guy's
[1:54:10] looking like this and I finally took the
[1:54:11] coat off and I gave it to him and he got
[1:54:13] up and left the meeting
[1:54:16] I'm glad well you're not him and and and
[1:54:19] he left the meeting I'm like what in the
[1:54:21] world is going on
[1:54:22] you know I found out later he was the
[1:54:25] Pentecostal overseer of that area
[1:54:27] and the young man in the back who was
[1:54:29] hollering amen was a man he'd been
[1:54:31] telling he was a young Pentecostal
[1:54:33] Minister and he was telling that
[1:54:34] Minister that this message is a cult and
[1:54:37] it's false
[1:54:38] and God just want me to use his coat and
[1:54:40] tell that other minister don't wear his
[1:54:42] coat and try to be like him
[1:54:44] [Applause]
[1:54:50] he had the sin he had to send somebody
[1:54:53] out to get groceries
[1:54:57] because he's after that election he has
[1:55:01] said in his word I will not lose one of
[1:55:05] them that Antichrist Spirit has come in
[1:55:09] and over your life and he's told things
[1:55:11] to you he's told you you can't be free
[1:55:17] but I want to tell the devil something
[1:55:19] tonight
[1:55:20] it's time for you to go get the
[1:55:22] groceries
[1:55:23] [Applause]
[1:55:29] and I got daughters here they're not of
[1:55:32] the genealogy they thought they was
[1:55:34] [Applause]
[1:55:39] yes red is the color of Edom yes the one
[1:55:43] who sold the birthright
[1:55:46] sorted out
[1:55:48] it wasn't worth it to him
[1:55:50] it's that kind of spirit
[1:55:52] just try to kill the birth
[1:55:58] don't you ever settle

[1:56:34] and because he has so many different
[1:56:35] names
[1:56:37] that's what makes him a real enemy

[1:59:48] I'm not afraid of you in church
[1:59:51] not afraid of you how loud you sing
[1:59:55] I'm not afraid of you
[1:59:57] I don't mind if you come to church

[2:00:31] getting older
[2:00:33] as you get older you see more I gotta
[2:00:35] say brother I've probably seen more than
[2:00:37] you you know why I'm three times older
[2:00:39] than you that don't make me a greater
[2:00:42] person this makes me older
[2:00:45] but I've seen people come right up to
[2:00:47] the name of Jesus
[2:00:49] and turn around
[2:00:51] and walk away
[2:00:53] because another father
[2:00:55] had told them
[2:00:57] they can't be free
[2:00:58] they came right up to the greatest
[2:01:02] name
[2:01:03] ever has been ever will be ever could be
[2:01:06] given
[2:01:07] the name of Jesus
[2:01:10] there's power in that name
[2:01:13] Satan hates that name so he has to try
[2:01:16] to make a substitute for that name his
[2:01:19] only chance of having any Victory is in
[2:01:23] lie
[2:01:24] that's true
[2:01:26] the guy can make you think tonight at
[2:01:29] the name of Jesus will not change my
[2:01:31] situation but it's going to take Danny
[2:01:34] or she'll have to take one of these
[2:01:35] preachers Amen to speak to you you have
[2:01:37] missed it
[2:01:39] behold I set before you an Open Door
[2:01:43] this was the the crutch the The Crossing
[2:01:45] between Philadelphia and laodicea and he
[2:01:48] said it goes far into the last age and
[2:01:50] why was it that God sent to God showed
[2:01:53] that prophet he said I had a dream he
[2:01:55] said I believe it came from God and I
[2:01:57] saw a man abusing his wife
[2:02:00] beating her and beating her with a club
[2:02:02] every time she would try to rise up he
[2:02:05] said there's a church trying to receive
[2:02:07] Revelation he would beat her down with
[2:02:09] her his Dogma with a three-cornered club
[2:02:12] the dogma of the trinity
[2:02:15] amen I know what it's like to be
[2:02:17] confused I have I have relatives in in
[2:02:20] the church believe in the Trinity and
[2:02:22] they say we don't know who to pray to we
[2:02:24] go we don't want to offend one of them
[2:02:27] they use it over their life and beat
[2:02:29] them down every time she tries to get up
[2:02:31] he beats him down with a lie
[2:02:36] but he was sent to this age the word was
[2:02:39] sent to this age to go and take that man
[2:02:42] by the caller
[2:02:44] sorry buddy if you were sleeping you're
[2:02:47] not now

[2:02:58] me

[2:03:13] example he looked like he was afraid of
[2:03:15] me what was it the word that has come in

[2:03:20] has been over the church for generations
[2:03:22] and generations I'm here to tell you
[2:03:25] amen that the message of the hour is the
[2:03:28] revelation of Jesus Christ to tell you

[2:06:56] there I'm
[2:06:59] every service should be like that
[2:07:02] we come in here to this garden and we
[2:07:05] bring out the potential brother Branham
[2:07:08] said if you could only realize the
[2:07:09] potential of this meeting
[2:07:11] it's not because I flew from Florida
[2:07:13] that there's potential here the
[2:07:15] potential is that you have come and he
[2:07:18] has come amen and he is here to give you
[2:07:21] the desire of your heart that's in the
[2:07:23] word he's here to give it to you bring
[2:07:26] it right to you
[2:07:30] perfect environment
[2:07:32] nothing was wrong
[2:07:34] until the serpent said
[2:07:38] hey you know that sermon that was
[2:07:40] preached the other day
[2:07:46] I have a little bit different angle than
[2:07:48] that
[2:07:51] she goes man
[2:07:53] what's your streaming address
[2:08:00] can I subscribe to you
[2:08:04] well you know it's the beast at the
[2:08:06] beginning he's the beast at the end
[2:08:08] good very good and he began to tell her
[2:08:12] something so convincing that she began
[2:08:15] to misquote
[2:08:18] the word of God brother Branham said all
[2:08:23] it needs is one word missing and it's a
[2:08:26] gap Satan can pour His poison into you
[2:08:30] know maybe Adam was not the best
[2:08:31] preacher that ever hit the face of the
[2:08:33] Earth
[2:08:34] serpent was a good one
[2:08:39] two different fathers
[2:08:46] here Satan has used him and he's
[2:08:48] deceived Eve Eve was actually deceived
[2:08:52] and he impregnated her
[2:08:55] and she came back to her husband so
[2:08:58] happy
[2:09:01] Adam I've got something to tell you it
[2:09:05] is so good and full of life
[2:09:09] and she didn't know she was full of
[2:09:10] death
[2:09:13] brother bam said she actually thought
[2:09:15] that boy was from the Lord
[2:09:19] yes that's right
[2:09:21] I have life
[2:09:25] and Adam
[2:09:27] was God of the Earth
[2:09:31] Lord over all of that creation God had
[2:09:35] set him in
[2:09:39] Adam looked at her
[2:09:41] he knew what had happened
[2:09:47] and he looked at her
[2:09:53] now I have to choose
[2:09:56] right perfect environment
[2:10:01] perfect health
[2:10:03] perfect Fellowship
[2:10:07] do I want all this
[2:10:11] but if I keep it
[2:10:14] I lose her
[2:10:21] I'm going to change the meeting for just
[2:10:23] a minute and let Adam himself come and
[2:10:24] stand here and tell you
[2:10:30] I loved her
[2:10:33] and I didn't want to lose her
[2:10:36] but I knew
[2:10:39] if I stood up and said
[2:10:42] what you have is wrong
[2:10:45] I'll lose you forever
[2:10:47] and you'll be destroyed
[2:10:50] I can't lose you
[2:10:53] Adam's the god of the earth he knows
[2:10:55] what he's doing
[2:10:57] right his last Act
[2:11:00] as God of the Earth
[2:11:03] is to step out
[2:11:05] and take her to himself
[2:11:08] as soon as he partook in her sin
[2:11:11] first Adam
[2:11:13] he lost his consciousness of who he was
[2:11:17] and he fell
[2:11:19] and the environment was lost the perfect
[2:11:22] church was lost
[2:11:25] everything is ruined isn't it
[2:11:28] everything is ruined he thought he knew
[2:11:30] God
[2:11:34] he went and told his wife said listen
[2:11:36] we're in trouble now
[2:11:38] we've messed up
[2:11:40] let's make us some figs
[2:11:42] fig leaves and cover ourself and
[2:11:45] maybe God will accept it
[2:11:49] and they went and they covered
[2:11:51] themselves and they heard the voice of
[2:11:53] God walking right
[2:11:56] Adam
[2:11:59] why did you come to this meeting this
[2:12:01] weekend
[2:12:03] why are you here
[2:12:06] what have you done
[2:12:14] do you know how pitiful it is
[2:12:17] when a man lose sight of his genealogy
[2:12:22] and he becomes less of a man
[2:12:25] than what he was born to be
[2:12:29] I tell you what Lord if you hadn't give
[2:12:31] me that woman I wouldn't have had this
[2:12:33] problem
[2:12:35] it's the woman you gave me
[2:12:38] he lost his mind
[2:12:41] because while he was God he took him to
[2:12:43] herself himself yeah
[2:12:46] when he lost his mind
[2:12:49] he blamed her
[2:12:51] and he turned his whole home
[2:12:53] into a wretched place
[2:12:56] a waste howling wilderness
[2:13:03] God said
[2:13:05] I've heard what you said
[2:13:07] it's pitiful
[2:13:09] what an excuse to blame your wife
[2:13:13] and to blame me maybe some of you are
[2:13:15] sitting here like that blaming someone
[2:13:17] else
[2:13:19] for your condition
[2:13:22] but you're before the Lord tonight
[2:13:25] and he turned to the woman what have you
[2:13:27] done
[2:13:29] the woman said well here's exactly what
[2:13:31] happened the serpent beguile me
[2:13:34] and he turned to the serpent now you
[2:13:37] weren't there but can you imagine
[2:13:39] the extreme fear
[2:13:44] because this serpent we're told he
[2:13:46] settled he can talk and Satan has
[2:13:49] anointed him
[2:13:50] he can give an excuse he can give a
[2:13:52] reason he can turn children of God and
[2:13:54] convince him perfect environment is not
[2:13:56] perfect perfect health is not perfect he
[2:13:59] can convince them that God's word is not
[2:14:02] enough and he's clearing his throat to
[2:14:04] say well the devil made me do it
[2:14:09] but God didn't even ask his opinion
[2:14:12] he turned to him and said because you've
[2:14:15] done this you're cursed
[2:14:18] and on your belly you shall go can you
[2:14:21] imagine those two standing there in that
[2:14:23] courtroom and they see this upright
[2:14:26] Beautiful Beast go right down to the
[2:14:29] ground and their thought
[2:14:36] I'm next
[2:14:43] I'm next
[2:14:45] what did Satan attack he attacked the
[2:14:47] birth
[2:14:51] he attacked the birth
[2:14:53] because he attacked the birth of Sons
[2:14:55] and Daughters of God God came down
[2:14:58] and when he cursed the enemy he's on the
[2:15:00] ground
[2:15:01] and they're looking at that and they're
[2:15:03] sitting here in dread what is he going
[2:15:05] to tell me
[2:15:09] God told him there's consequences of
[2:15:11] what you've done
[2:15:12] but I want to make a prophecy over this
[2:15:15] situation there be enmity
[2:15:18] between thy seed and the woman's seed I
[2:15:21] want to make a prophecy in this hour of
[2:15:24] darkness when everything has been lost
[2:15:26] I'm making a prophecy
[2:15:29] and I'm going to show you something
[2:15:31] Adam what you covered yourself with is
[2:15:34] not enough and he killed a lamb
[2:15:39] he placed that bleeding Lamb's clothes
[2:15:42] around him
[2:15:44] he says you're going out of the garden
[2:15:47] but there be a day you're coming back
[2:15:49] [Music]
[2:15:54] what was a symbol there
[2:15:57] brother Benham began to describe it he
[2:16:00] said I can look and I saw them weeping
[2:16:03] as they're going out of the garden but
[2:16:05] there's something beating
[2:16:07] something beating against their legs and
[2:16:10] it's what God has placed around them
[2:16:12] they are victims amen they've become
[2:16:16] victims of a satanic attack the serpent
[2:16:19] at the beginning but there's a prophecy
[2:16:21] and he says God couldn't stand it as he
[2:16:23] watched them walking out with that blood
[2:16:25] running down them he said but there be
[2:16:27] enmity
[2:16:32] your head will bruise his heel
[2:16:35] what does that mean it didn't mean God's
[2:16:37] just going to step on and say ouch that
[2:16:40] meant God was going to take a hold of
[2:16:42] Satan's plan and draw it close to him
[2:16:44] and he was not going to be able to let
[2:16:46] Satan was not going to be able to get
[2:16:48] free from Amen brother man said let me
[2:16:51] turn your attention now to another time
[2:16:53] and I see a man walking up a hill and I
[2:16:57] hear something else beaten again
[2:16:58] something walking coming down his legs
[2:17:02] who is it amen it's not a lamb it's the
[2:17:05] Lamb of God
[2:17:15] he's going there
[2:17:18] because he knew the trail of the serpent
[2:17:20] would come into my home
[2:17:23] and I couldn't be free of him
[2:17:26] while I was yet in sin
[2:17:29] he died for me
[2:17:33] he took my enemy close to himself
[2:17:36] the enemy said there's only one thing's
[2:17:38] never been defeated and that's death
[2:17:41] every Prophet has died every great man

[2:59:34] all the knowledge of all the world of
[2:59:36] all the wisdoms of all the books
[2:59:39] there's a devil
[2:59:41] and there's a God hallelujah he's casted
[2:59:45] his vote against you
[2:59:47] all right he's casted his hope for you
[2:59:52] now you decide who you want to be
[2:59:56] but you know we have a flaw
[3:00:01] that's how we're human
[3:00:05] and God knew that
[3:00:07] so he made us a promise I'd like to read
[3:00:10] just this a little story in the Bible
[3:00:14] found in
[3:00:16] the 19th Chapter of the books of Acts
[3:00:20] and as it came to pass that while
[3:00:23] Apollos was at Corinth Paul having
[3:00:26] passed through the upper Coast
[3:00:29] to Ephesus and finding certain disciples
[3:00:34] he said unto them have ye received the
[3:00:37] Holy Ghost since you believed
[3:00:41] and they said unto him we haven't even
[3:00:43] know so much as heard whether there be
[3:00:46] any Holy Ghost
[3:00:49] and he said unto them
[3:00:52] unto what then were ye baptized
[3:00:55] and they said unto John's baptism now I
[3:00:58] love that because he said wait a minute
[3:01:01] you don't have the Holy Ghost and you
[3:01:03] don't know what it is he says then then
[3:01:07] how are you baptized because he knew
[3:01:10] there was a promise that if you were
[3:01:12] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:01:14] Christ you shall receive the gift of the
[3:01:17] Holy Ghost that's right so he knew if
[3:01:19] they didn't have the Holy Ghost he knew
[3:01:22] that the formula wasn't following all
[3:01:26] right that's it that's good Paul
[3:01:28] believed the word
[3:01:31] amen and so what did he say he said and
[3:01:35] then Paul said John verely baptized unto
[3:01:38] repentance
[3:01:42] that's how far most of us go a lot of
[3:01:44] times we've been to the altar a hundred
[3:01:47] times repenting
[3:01:51] [Music]
[3:01:53] you know why because we're human right
[3:01:57] because we do things wrong
[3:02:00] but listen as we read a little farther
[3:02:03] he said John very baptized unto
[3:02:06] repentance saying unto the people that
[3:02:10] they should believe on him should who
[3:02:12] should come after him and that is on the
[3:02:15] Lord Jesus and when they heard this they
[3:02:19] were baptized in the name
[3:02:21] of the Lord Jesus
[3:02:24] and when Paul had laid his hands on them
[3:02:27] they received
[3:02:29] the Holy Ghost
[3:02:32] see we're human right
[3:02:35] so what God
[3:02:37] did for us
[3:02:39] he said you go on the upper room and you
[3:02:42] wait there
[3:02:43] until you're endured with the power from
[3:02:49] above we have lots of names for that we
[3:02:53] call it the new birth
[3:02:55] we call it being born again
[3:02:58] we call it the baptism of the Holy
[3:03:01] Spirit
[3:03:02] but remember there's one thing that it
[3:03:04] was you shall receive the gift
[3:03:07] of the Holy Spirit
[3:03:09] the holy spirit is God's gift to you
[3:03:17] it's it's a power
[3:03:20] that could be manifested in many
[3:03:23] different ways but it's a Wellspring of
[3:03:27] Living Waters that bubbles up inside of
[3:03:30] you amen
[3:03:34] and
[3:03:35] I want you to know tonight
[3:03:39] that you know whether that's happened or
[3:03:42] not
[3:03:44] I like how Danny put it once that's
[3:03:46] happened to you if you backslide it
[3:03:49] calls you back and it calls you back and
[3:03:52] it calls you back you can never deny it
[3:03:56] [Music]
[3:03:58] I've not always been what I wanted to be
[3:04:01] I haven't always been what I should be
[3:04:05] but I'll guarantee you when he met me on
[3:04:07] that
[3:04:09] roof that day in my life
[3:04:12] I've never been the same
[3:04:16] I look in the mirror and I don't see and
[3:04:19] like that guy that I see there but I
[3:04:21] know he gave me a gift
[3:04:24] I didn't earn it
[3:04:28] but I needed it
[3:04:31] [Music]
[3:04:33] if this formula was so important to Paul
[3:04:40] to get the Holy Ghost
[3:04:43] then I want to offer
[3:04:46] that to you tonight
[3:04:49] if you've never been baptized
[3:04:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:04:56] [Music]
[3:04:57] there's a pool back here
[3:05:01] the formula simple repent
[3:05:05] repent isn't
[3:05:07] getting a list
[3:05:10] a mile long of all the sins
[3:05:13] that's what I used to do when I was a
[3:05:15] Catholic
[3:05:16] I'd go into the priest and I'd kneel
[3:05:19] down and say father I stole the candy
[3:05:21] bar and I did this and I did that
[3:05:26] that was a list
[3:05:29] what the sin was I didn't believe
[3:05:32] I didn't believe that he could send a
[3:05:35] power to change me
[3:05:39] and you've heard that power preached
[3:05:42] tonight you've heard the gospel preached
[3:05:45] in the power
[3:05:46] of the Resurrection
[3:05:49] and you know the baptism the holy spirit
[3:05:52] is a possession it's not something you
[3:05:56] can buy it's not something you can
[3:05:58] purchase because he already purchased
[3:06:00] it's a free gift
[3:06:03] all you have to do is ask for it
[3:06:07] Lord I need a power
[3:06:11] I need something from you a Wellspring
[3:06:14] in my heart a power sent from on high
[3:06:17] that's going to keep me that's going to
[3:06:20] change my nature that's going to make me
[3:06:23] different amen
[3:06:25] [Music]
[3:06:27] there was another group of people that
[3:06:29] heard the same gospel and they cried out
[3:06:32] in their heart men and Brethren what
[3:06:34] must we do
[3:06:37] what what what can I do to to to get
[3:06:41] this the power this this anointing this
[3:06:45] blessing that I I see on these feet but
[3:06:48] what must we do he said repent be
[3:06:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:06:55] Christ
[3:06:56] and you shall
[3:06:59] receive
[3:07:01] the gift
[3:07:02] of the holy spirit amen Paul was so sure
[3:07:06] of that word
[3:07:07] that when they didn't have it he said
[3:07:10] then where how you been baptized because
[3:07:13] if you were baptized right
[3:07:14] [Music]
[3:07:18] baptized right your heart
[3:07:22] repented
[3:07:24] Lord I'm just a sinner
[3:07:27] it's not what I did
[3:07:29] not all the accident it's what I am
[3:07:34] and I want to be different
[3:07:36] and I can't be different if you don't
[3:07:39] give me a power from on high
[3:07:46] and if you ever get it
[3:07:49] you won't have to be up here
[3:07:52] time and time again
[3:07:56] you won't have to have
[3:07:58] preachers huddled all around you
[3:08:01] trying to encourage you
[3:08:05] know that Spirit comes by and it
[3:08:07] convicts you of sin
[3:08:09] and you quickly say Abba Father yes I'm
[3:08:12] sorry Lord
[3:08:14] and you get right
[3:08:16] to do it in your seat it's over all
[3:08:20] right because nothing can pluck you out
[3:08:22] of the palm of his hand and if he
[3:08:24] started a work in you he'll finish it to
[3:08:27] him
[3:08:28] [Music]
[3:08:30] and I ask you have you received all
[3:08:33] right
[3:08:34] the Holy Spirit
[3:08:37] tend to believe
[3:08:40] you want to quit struggling with the
[3:08:43] flesh all the time
[3:08:45] there's a power
[3:08:50] called the gift of God yes it's called
[3:08:52] the spirit of God
[3:08:56] and it convicts you of unbelief
[3:08:59] and when you stray it calls you back and
[3:09:03] when you get angry it it convicts you so
[3:09:06] bad you make it right when you offend
[3:09:09] your brother it makes you go over and
[3:09:10] grab him and say brother I didn't mean
[3:09:12] to do that I'm sorry and it keeps you
[3:09:15] yes it seals you and it takes you
[3:09:19] and the best part about it it's for you
[3:09:26] but you gotta come the way he provided
[3:09:29] he paid the price
[3:09:31] [Music]

[3:09:43] preached

[3:09:49] I'll believe tonight if you don't know
[3:09:52] that Satan's real
[3:09:54] [Music]
[3:09:55] now and see this world falling apart
[3:09:59] but our brother also told us something
[3:10:01] else he told us that he's real yeah
[3:10:04] and he can abide in your heart today
[3:10:08] and I don't care I known people that
