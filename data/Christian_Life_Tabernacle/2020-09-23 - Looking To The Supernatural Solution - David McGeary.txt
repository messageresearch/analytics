Description:
Looking To The Supernatural Solution
Br. David McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: September 23,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] we are not here looking back to history [Music] we are not praying to something that was a memory but we are calling upon a living person that is in our midst right now a life that's hid from the wise and prudent but it's revealed unto babes that such as would learn you said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and burdened and i'll give you rest and to think father that you are actually here tonight because you said you would be here you said wherever two or three are gathered together that you'd be in our midst and in osea their age is so dark and and wicked that standing right in the midst we can't see you and you cautioned us that we would buy eye sap that we might see father we know that eye sab is the word of god that rolls back every cloud of darkness that reveals your living grace in your presence father we've come here tonight together those that have assembled out those father that are joined us by way of streamed this evening we asked father that you would make that isabel available to us this evening because you counseled us to seek it you counseled us to get gold the father that's been tried in fire to put on white raiment and to seek after i sat father we've come this evening to ask you to anoint our eyes anoint our hearts anoint our spirits may the riches of your word begin to move on our lives and cause an effect not a personal effect on our lives only father but in the lives of those that we come in contact with [Music] may every situation know that god has moved into their midst through his living bride we just asked father tonight that we could grow in you we ask these things because we're needy of them but we have a wonderful name to ask in the name of the lord jesus christ bless us father we pray in your name amen amen god bless you we take your bibles this evening and i believe we have i don't know maybe 25 30 people uh joining us by way of a live stream so we're always uh grateful for those that would come into our midst and by way of the stream i hope that we don't get too comfortable with that to where you know we we come to the place where we would rather stay home and instead of come to church you know it's pretty easy i have to admit i was out with my mother and so leslie and i went into the room down there and and watched it on on stream you know and uh it's just real easy to sit back on the couch and put your feet up you know what i mean and just kind of you know think about getting a cup of coffee and and kind of relaxing and and and that's good for an alternative but you don't want to fall in love with an alternative and that's sort of what we uh want to talk about tonight uh if i have a title i would call it uh looking to the supernatural solution looking to the supernatural solution so let's just turn in our bibles and and we want to uh just read uh uh just this scripture uh uh starting um in saint john the gospel of saint john the first chapter and we'll just read through the 13th verse and we'll just have this little time of fellowship tonight and um it's a little portion we're gonna fellowship around uh this evening by way of like a bible study i'll be in missouri this sunday saturday night and sunday at what we refer to as the fish fry meeting brother brown basically has just shortened his meeting up and is just doing a meeting for his congregation and a lot of people have asked us he says well are you going to have your meeting this in november yes but our meetings we're full with our people so we're having a meeting for us nobody else is invited you know what i mean if they show up we'll try to accommodate them but i'm sure that will fill the building and and have a good time so we've asked uh brother tom ray to come brother michael ray to come and brother murphy wong to come so we're trusting that they'll do it you can fly in and out of the united states but it's a little more difficult to drive across the border but so we're anticipating that they'll be able to do that brother tom just had foot surgery replaced his ankle and and helped him prove that and he told me he says well you know i don't know if i'll be able to to do it i said well brother tom the scripture says blessed is the feet of them that preach the gospel so i i said if you you've got to come preach the gospel because that's the best way to make that foot better so we're really looking forward to it but anyway that's just an update let's read the scripture says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now that's you okay you were made by him there was a man sent from god whose name was okay excuse me and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he is not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was a that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not what a statement he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave ye power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen god bless you may be seated we're going to i'm going to just speak a few words and then i want to play seven minutes this evening out of the message perfect faith and these seven minutes you could preach a lifetime on i i just think as you begin to think about this as we're going to listen to it it becomes the answer to all of our problems and we we realize that we are going to have to have faith faith is the most important part of a christian's life because without faith it's impossible to please god so it it becomes uh uh as as we will listen it it becomes something that god is looking to you to have so you you've got to have it it it is a characteristic if i could say it that way it is an identification of what a believer is you can't say that you're a believer and not have faith you you understand so that's basically what the uh word stands for is that that that you have faith that you've received him and if those who have received him he gave them power to be the sons and daughters of god and uh that that if i could use that term and put it into practical sense that my sons and my daughter have a special privilege being my children and i know i get in a lot of trouble because of that because of my office but to my sons and my daughter they know that they can come to their father and sometimes they extend that a privilege and that relationship maybe into areas that it doesn't belong sometimes you know i i love my my granddaughter and i i appreciate i know she gets embarrassed when i i i i tell this little story but it it it it reflects the the privilege that she felt so you have to understand when he says he gave him power to become sons and daughters in other words he empowered them to have a privilege and an access to the throne that not everybody has it's a privilege in other words you'll know that a father and a mother they they put their children first okay and i don't care if their kids are dead wrong you are going to get a defense right it's just how it is they're going to give an explanation they're going to give a reason they're going to they're going to tell you why in fact they'll give you a life history of all the hardships the child has been through you know what i mean it's just that protective instinct of a parent so when you enter into this relationship this privilege like i was saying that you know little kaylee looked across at my the neighbor and said well i'll have you to know that my grandpa's the pastor and i thought well that's pretty good i kind of like that you know it it talked about a relationship and a privilege so we realized that we've got to be in this this atmosphere of faith because without faith it's impossible to please god and we have to have faith because the rapture is based upon this faith in other words the reason that the seals were opened and part of the reason that the seals were open was to reveal the son of perdition it was to show the two spirits coming down through the church ages because he knew that once we were able to identify the two spirits that were working in the framework of the church that we could resist the one and then when we are able to resist that spirit now resist means to stop the influence of that spirit over us because remember the whole purpose of the antichrist spirit is to do one thing how many know what it is to discredit the word of god another word to make the promises of god of none effect that caulk he wanted to do that's why he got on that first horse rider and began to lie to the church because he wanted to take him away what did he get him to do he got him to lose their what first love to hold back that's real important so he he he destroyed that and then he moved up to the next horse right and so when he got on that horse he started using fear he took the love away is that correct and and there's only two forces right love and fear so he took the once he got rid of the love now he could impose his will by fear because what did he do he went and killed everybody that disagreed with him everybody that stood up he began to do it in fear and then once he could he did away with that he brought him into darkness and they brought into darkness and then he went when he became a pale horse that was a horse of confusion so what did he do he took the faith and he broke it up into hundreds of different denominations hundreds of different interpretations hundreds and different avenues and roads to try to get to the same place and so here's a purse people not knowing which way to turn praise god there was some eagles in the chicken yard amen they didn't know what they were but they knew they weren't chickens they knew they weren't satisfied with the scratch they knew they weren't satisfied with the atmosphere they knew they went from chicken coop to chicken coop to chicken coop but they were adrift and they were wandering the prophet god said it's just like you you stumble from church to church and then you stumbled upon this because so when we realized that he came and when he exposed that when the seals opened up and exposed the son of perdition exposed the denominational spirit exposed how the deception was there and then he was to turn our hearts back to the faith of our fathers that's what that's what it was so what's supposed to be restored back to us is the faith so what opened up when them seals opened up the what was contained when the thunders uttered their voices and the seals were opened up what was contained in those was rapturing faith was faith now we so we're understanding that we've got to have that faith because the rapture is a supernatural event the rapture is and the prophet of god said this he's if they see if i could just uh read it to you real quick so you can understand that the rapture is a condition he said this so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now so do you understand it and i know the denominational world and everybody has has preached it like a time table but when they ask jesus give us the time table he said that's for the father to decide so it's for the father to decide when his children have got into the condition that he can rapture them you understand that this is just a sunday school on wednesday night it's all right with you so you you have to understand so this determination is based on the father's recognition of a people possessing faith enough faith to be raptured okay he's provided everything he he we need the number one thing he provided for us is the shed blood at calvary that covers all of our sins and he made a covenant that if you confess your sins that he's faithful and just to forgive him amen your sin only stays with you as long as it's unconfessed it only has effect on you as long as it's unconfessed but once it's confessed and placed under the shed blood it's thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more hallelujah i need the blood that's the only place that god will meet you is under the shed blood the sacrifice that he made for you so he's got the hip the determination is made by him the father knoweth the time in the hour no man knows that i mean people get burned out looking at the world and trying to create a calendar you can't put a supernatural eternal people in a man-made calendar their life doesn't even come from there and that's why this message didn't just bring us back to calvary it brought us back to in the beginning it brought us all the way back and brought our origin all the way back so now what he's trying to do is to get us into rapturing condition and he says in order to get into that rapturing condition we're going to have to have substance faith so we're going to have to have faith because the rapture is based on faith and the rapture is a supernatural event based on condition so that's what we're talking about tonight is looking to the supernatural solution and and this is what happens to us is we've always been taught and i talked with you on this before but we've always kind of been taught that god is the last resort after we've tried every other option then we turn to the lord and and it it's kind of uh a last resort you know in in instead of uh it it being uh the first option it becomes the last option and and and so we're going to uh i'm going to go ahead and speak this little next section to you and and and then you can listen to this and we'll finish up but so we we want to understand that this faith that we have is based on something faith has a resting place we know that faith final resting place is the word of god faith final resting place is not the doctrines and the teaching that men have summarized from reading the bible faith is based on what he said to you faith is personal there's not a general faith that we all obtain to faith is personal it's a personal relationship because that what faith is and and we will listen to this in a moment that faith is is based on love love and faith go hand in hand so if we want to have faith then we've got to understand what it is that creates this faith and it's not exercise you know and and we because exercise and others rituals and ceremonies they profit very little there's a more substance a relationship that takes place that builds faith and if i could say it like this it's like in a marriage a relationship of some sort if you look at the troubles and you look at the finances and you look at the bills and and you start looking at the kids and what you have and what you don't have you will grow apart you'll just do it so and i'm i want you to listen to this when you we all together listen to this seven minutes this seven minutes is extremely extremely powerful it says but you've got to concentrate on the love that you have okay that is what that you've got to concentrate on if the love you have one for another you could that has got that's what overpowers all the circumstances that what's overpowers everything else if you can if you can enkindle that love that if you can remember that love if you can bring that love back to the surface and that creates that union and that unity then you've got the nucleus of what you started out with all the trouble was just added it wasn't added by you it was added by everything around you but it should never affect the very substance that brought you together in the first place now hold that thought to when we talk about our relationship with him so you've got to concentrate on the love you have that's what you've got to put your emphasis on that's what you've got to put your concentration on because i want the prophet's going to just lay this out to us i mean it's so powerful that it's it's just it just becomes something because faith grows by love that that is the substance of faith and and and and he also makes this statement in there it says won't his love take care of you so we're talking about this faith that we have to have because without perfect love and without perfect faith we will not be there so now we know something that we have to have okay we totally 100 percent know something that we have to have and we want to know how do we get that if what happens to us is we avoid that and we look to carnal solutions people find themselves in a spot where they have to have money and what happens i don't care what it is that's causing the want for money or the need for money but they turn to all kinds of carnal realities to get it they steal they cheat they rob god i'll just say that you know i don't preach a lot on money but you might take heed do your own personal study they go to all kinds of options instead of seeking a supernatural solution instead of turning to a supernatural solution and we've got to understand that in our lives we have an unseen force that's with us and that unseen force that's with us is the love of god god so loved us he gave us only begotten son god is love and so even in building the statue of a perfect man to when we come to that what the holy spirit leads us into is into that capstone which gives this love so this next seven minutes is the capstone ministry if we could catch it it's okay it it it's important to us because we what we do is we get in to a relationships and into situations where our are for some reason we turn our eyes on ourselves so much that we get this attitude maybe we're not worthy to seek a supernatural solution or we don't have faith to seek the supernatural solution it's not number one it's not the number one solution on our list it becomes an alternative solution it it it it's it it takes final desperation to put us there but the reason god allows the desperation to force you to that place is so you can have the experience and then after you've had the experience it it ought to be a lesson enough to you not to take the desperation route again how many times do you have to take the wrong turn i mean how many times have i missed the expressway exit coming 35 north and end up on 8 20 or end up over here or end up on this you know you think when are you going to learn not to make the wrong turn and i put that in carnal uh perspective in a carnal example because what's happening in our lives we're rolling through these things every day in our life if we don't even realize what the father is observing from the outside when he's looking at you he's sitting there waving his hand if you he's not fretting or nothing but he's sitting there saying hey children what about me what about me i promised you i'd never leave you nor forsake you i promised you you would never bake bread i i promised that i wouldn't give you a stone i wouldn't give you a serpent i know what you have need of even before you ask he he's he's made all these beautiful promises to us and all these whispers of love to us and of caring to us and he he's he's done all these things he said i'll not leave you nor forsake you i mean when you sit back this beautiful the one-sided love affair that's going on and here we are sitting in our world with the waves of uncertainty and confusion blowing in on us i see it i watch it i watch people want the pressure so bad on them that they want to make a change in their life they think moving here going here is going to make life better no it's not whatever you do get thus saith the lord don't take it from some second hand disconnect person that's gonna come along i think it's the lord's will you do this i think it's the lord's will do this but you you know could that just exactly what happened in the scriptures some said he was the christ and they went out in the desert here and somebody said the christ is over here and they went out of there some people said this is the anointing and that's the anointing and you you want to know something if you've got something in your heart that you believe and it doesn't line up with the word of god you're going to seek for an amen from somewhere you've got to be solid in god's word and that that solidness is based on him making you by receiving him and when you receive him what are you receiving you're receiving the love of the father that's what it is now when we listen to this listen closely because he's going to start out with being the master of every circumstance now he's going to go into how you can become a master of every circumstance and where does this perfect faith come from it's initiated by him and he wants you to have this faith but there's only one thing that will make that faith grow let's just listen to this seven minutes and because i could try to preach and explain until my lips are blue and i'll never be able to say it the way he can say it so let's just listen for a moment i think you'll really be blessed now so what i'm ask point wanting to point out to you is that love is the creator of faith you don't look at the results look at the relationship concentrate on the love and when you concentrate on the love and you enter into that love and you enter into that relationship and you recognize that and you have that the result of the relationship is faith faith does not produce the love love produces the faith and this just list is marvelous and it brother brown puts it right in the middle of perfect faith he talks about the substance he talks about the faith he talks about what jesus does and then he takes this seven minutes to talk about the love and then after he talks about the love he goes into abiding in that love staying in that love but let's just take the relationship part of it this evening and i really believe this will all help us move down the road to the supernatural because if we can't experience the supernatural results of the attributes remember the attributes causes the works then how are we going to move into absolutely a faith that's going to allow your body to be changed and for you to step from one dimension to another we've got to confront that head on god bless you i believe you really enjoy this perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances that don't have one thing to do with it it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and a large reveal that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and belong all right just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going it masters all circumstances amen well if you do this uh sword sword sort of that thing that already got it mastered me faith please that god will work it out i don't know how it's going to do it but do it anyhow it matters all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together you're just like a young couple you take a young man a young woman and they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another more their hearts just being defeated as one see they're yet they're not husband and wife but their love binds them together and they have confidence in one another now if they really love one another really love and you know that this girl loves you and and she knows that you love her you've got confidence faith in one another right you got faith in one if you didn't you better not marry me notice you gotta have faith and you separate them about one extreme south one extreme north they steal that love beachborne no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the law it's not trying to dodge hell but you love the law then you have faith in god if you love him like a a young girl just happened here in louisville not all a woman she was uh she's been a christian for many years but her husband had just fell in love she fell over this man he had been a christian a couple of years and so they got married they loved had confidence in one another and they got married and so the woman said to the man says hubby it must be hard on you you're just a young christian you've had so much to go through with drinking what it was that you've had so much to go through with and said i know you're about to be tempted awfully hard and said i want you to know one thing now now if you happen to fall if you happen to to fall into temptation and as overcome don't stay away from home you come on back you come right here because i'm gonna be right here waiting for you and i'm gonna help you praise you again until you get victory i'm gonna stay with you because when i married you i married you because i loved you no matter what you are i still love you two days i said he was eating his lunch with the fellas down in the boiling room he was telling them about so now how could a man ever do anything wrong when somebody knows you like that there you are how could you trespass that confidence and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world and that muck of mud as i talked about this morning god come to us am i god sought you you never saw god no man can come to me except the father draws you first and god came down in that muck watch you were and sought you out and brought you out that was a creator of perfect love look what you were and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you this [Music] real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when i was nothing i was still nothing but i'm in his hands he called me and he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when he was unlovable but he changed you yeah it's like the colored sister said that time in her testimony she said i'm not what i ought to be and i'm not what i want to be and then i'm not what i used to be she knows she'd come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when i was an alien from him so wealthy till he stood down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he sees something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people don't say it today look at the minions he could have tucked beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen you're in god's economy amen no one can do it that's his love to you then won't your love reach that back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is it's circumstances it's governed by this love and creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings to faith all right then it can't it can't keep from uh bringing out just exactly what god promised it would do now watch perfect faith is pure just as pure as love is see now when you love somebody and you got you love your husband or you love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you you don't do it because you do do it and you know you do it now if i've asked you uh how can you improve you do it well i'll prove it by the way i'll answer it see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me that i and i love my wife or i love my husband see that your life proves what you are the same thing christianity does amen see your faith you have confidence in one another is fewer and it's something real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you got it and your actions proven and when you got pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companions then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it's done just walk along no matter what the thing looks like what anybody else says you know what's happening you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as long as you know you love see love and faith has to go together they're kin folks they love love produces faith we just listen to the whole key the whole key you know we we spend and that's what i said looking for a supernatural solution we look to the results we look to a product we look to everything he says you don't have to look at anything else but the very fact that he stooped down in the muck and got you that was his love when you were unlovable he loved you when when when uh when uh uh you were down in the muck he went in there now he said if he loved you that much now just think about it now and he said those that receive him he gave power to become the sons and daughters of god so god so loved the world he was the expression of the love of god we know that god loves us john says and you can go read it herein is the love of god made perfect we know that god loves us because he sent us his only begotten son so we we unders we understand that that and he said that that we never chose him he chose us look at all the millions he he didn't choose now so here we're looking for this abundant faith we're looking for this faith that's going to produce the power and the demonstration of the resurrection because we know if we don't start experiencing the supernatural in our lives then the supernatural becomes a fantasy it becomes a myth but this faith is real substance faith which means it's really real and that only comes from a real substance love that's really real he and that's what he says you you you know you love him nobody has to explain anything to you you don't have to prove it to nobody you know that you love him and what is the key to that scripture we love him because he first loved us oh if we could settle that in our heart well we were yet sinners wasn't based on our righteousness it wasn't based on anything it was based on election he's seen something in you what did he see in you that little kinsman part that little seed so this is what i'm saying let's just read this again and listen to how beautiful it is then won't your love reach right back to him now we're talking about a supernatural solution so won't your love you're in trouble you're sick you're you're in financial straits you're in the valley of decision you're under a lot of pressure you you don't know where where to turn you don't know what to do you've got an airing child you've got someone that's being drawn away by the world music's working on them you know maybe it goes classmates maybe class circumstances it just seems like things are getting out of control and you don't you just are entering into such a battleground well that's the time you've got to know he loves you well that's when your love's got to reach back out your love's got to reach to him you've got to know that you've received him you've accepted this love in your heart and he says now won't you reach for your love reach right back to him lord i know you'll take care of me you told me to come unto you if i get heavy laden you told me to seek a supernatural solution god is the supernatural how can he be supernatural because everything that was made was made by him and nothing nothing that was made all things that were made were made by him there's nothing it's just no me all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made what what what a source and that source of all creation chose to project his love into your life because he wants you to have confidence in that love well can't you have confidence in this love can't you have confidence in the love that he showed to you can't you have confidence in what he's done in your life can't you look at your life and see that you're not what you maybe you're not what you want to be okay but you and and you you know that and you know you're not what you're supposed to be but you know you're not what you used to be you know you've had the effect of that love in your life so this is what he's saying look for a supernatural solution the supernatural solution lies in the love that he projected to you that that that beautiful love that's there and won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is or the circumstances it's governed by this love that's why love's the master of every circumstance that's why faith the master of every circumstance because with this love affair you're not in it alone he's in it with you he's committed to you and didn't you hear him he said just like that wife she was committed to her husband i'm committed to you sweetheart if you fall don't you stay away you come home i married you because i love you that that's the confidence that that's the love because he says that it's governed by this love that creates faith you can't bypass the recipe you understand you can't you can't go try to take a promise somewhere and say i'm going to make this promise work or he said so now i want you to catch this because this is the interpretation of the scripture that says depart from me you doers of iniquity i never you knew you they had the signs and wonders without the love affair and it's the love affair that produces rapturing faith because remember the prophet of god said god will not allow his bride and who would put his bride through all that tribulation it's the very essence of what the rapture is the rapture is god's love for his bride and her love back to him having confidence that he is not going to let her go through this tribulation that's fixing to hit the earth and then she can look up with her confidence and her love because that loves what produces rapturing faith love creates the faith let's concentrate on the love faith comes it's a byproduct of love this love affair creates the faith it only comes love creates faith love creates promise confidence in every promise and that's why peter was able to write by these divine precious promises we are partakers of divine nature we bypass the love and that was that's what put them on the outside of the church was the love affair wasn't there the doctrine was there the promises were there everybody was trying to produce wool you look at a promise and you said this should be in my life forget that it's the love affair that should be in our lives and if you have that love affair with him then you love everybody you're not worried about yourself you could you know that expression everybody use i've got your back i'm your wingman i'm there for you how would you like the creator of heaven and earth to have your back the creator of heaven earth to be your wingman the creator of heaven and earth saying i've got you brother mcgeary he said i got you he says yes i've caught you in the palm of my hand and nothing can pluck you out hallelujah i like that kind of that's the kind of person i want to have me that's what i want to be a part of that's what i want to know has got me amen that's that's what i'm looking i'm not concentrating on the trouble i'm concentrating on the love that's all i've got to concentrate on you concentrate on the love you'll have faith that's so powerful you can't express it that you won't even know you have it you're just in love these signs follow them that are in love that's what it's all about it's about getting our eyes off of everything but having him that love creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings the faith you love one another you've got confidence in one another that brings the faith here we are beating the people with promises beating the people that we ought to have power beating the people that we should have works and the question is wait a minute where does this faith come from well people try to preach as the baptism of the holy spirit anointed ones at the end time kind of ruins that it comes from love and where does the love start we love him because first love does first love does first love die can you receive that if you can receive that he's given you the privilege oh he's giving you the privilege to walk in and open the refrigerator he's giving you the privilege to walk in and ask for a few dollars he's giving you the privilege to walk in and ask for what you have you're a son you're a daughter you know you're his you know he loves you that that's the essence in these little pages that we listen to page 19 20 and 21 and in in 22 he explains to us where faith comes from where it comes from it's created faith is created god loves you you love him you're in a love affair what do you think he's going to do if he loves you he's going to create in you rapturing faith it comes from the love affair it doesn't come from theology it doesn't come from the opening of the mysteries to your eyes you're barking up the wrong tree sorry concentrate on the love it creates a love affair concentrate on the love the love will produce the faith he says god loves you and you love him and you love one another and that brings the faith all right then it can't but it can't keep you from bringing out just exactly what god promised it would do what did it promise it would do if the same spirit that was in christ jesus in you it would quicken your mortal body the promise from the father is this i go to prepare a place for you and if i go a purple place for you i will come again and receive you that where i am you will be also thank you lord i have that promise doesn't that remind you of a story of a rancher huh and he promised the little girl she was just a cinderella type but he promised he'd come get for what did she do all the other ones were gapping all the denominations he's picking me he's picking me she just loved him she knew she loved him no matter how far apart they were him in chicago her way down here but he went prepared a place for it he went and made the mansion he went and got all the maids he went and got everything that he would come again and receive her that where he is she would be also he didn't care about her dresses he could make dresses he had seamstresses all over town he didn't care about pomp and all that stuff he wanted someone that'd be a good mother what did he look for he looked for that character and where did he find there where did he find her barefoot in a puddle of muddy dishwashing doing the dishes and when he approached her oh she was humble she was sweet his heart looked at that seed that character and began to beat for and he loved her and when did he love her what did he say i'm gonna come take you out of you being the maid i'm gonna come take you out of you doing all the dirty dishes i'm going to come and take you out of doing all the ironing i'm going to come and take you out of being the laughingstock the stepchild i'm going to come deliver you oh you know you know the story it just makes my heart beat and and and it just and just what he's saying here what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he promised you then real genuine love creates a confidence in his word oh my brothers and sisters we get looking at the wrong thing we get barking up the wrong tree we don't look for a supernatural solution where is our supernatural solution our supernatural solution is in a supernatural love by a supernatural god that loves you and nothing nothing not peril not sword not principalities not powers nothing can separate us from the love of god that's in christ jesus how many wants their faith to increase amen if you want your faith to increase concentrate on the love affair you have on the relationship you put him first and your faith will grow because love creates faith and god bless you
