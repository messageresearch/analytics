[0:00] sometimes god will allow you to go
[0:02] through your present condition
[0:04] because it's better for your eternal end
[0:07] [Music]
[0:09] and that's what he's interested in
[0:12] he's interested in spending eternity
[0:15] with him
[0:16] he's not interested in you being
[0:18] dissolved in fire
[0:22] and done away with his heart's desire
[0:25] is that that he can spend eternity so he
[0:29] only honors
[0:30] what he provides and so as we
[0:34] look at this we say that
[0:37] they hewed for themselves cisterns
[0:41] and so what a cistern is it's something
[0:44] that's man-made
[0:48] and its purpose is is to catch
[0:51] water and there's all
[0:54] types of of cisterns but a cistern
[0:58] has a a specific
[1:01] uh characteristic about it
[1:04] and that's and so we know that a cistern
[1:08] represents a denomination
[1:12] something that's man-made and that's why
[1:15] we said
[1:16] this morning that we're saying it's a
[1:19] man-made
[1:21] uh denomination
[1:25] or a man-made sister or what is the
[1:28] characteristics
[1:30] of somebody that makes themselves
[1:35] and that that's what so as we look at
[1:39] that and we look at it it says they
[1:41] hewed out
[1:42] for themselves cistern and and what is
[1:45] the sister and type of it's a type of
[1:48] something
[1:48] that's man made it
[1:52] and and it's made to catch water
[1:55] which is a type of the spirit
[1:59] and so now we realize that the the
[2:02] the cistern it can't hold water
[2:06] and it holds no water so you know it's a
[2:09] man-made
[2:10] catch all right so it catches the spirit
[2:15] it's just like uh you know songs with an
[2:18] anointing on it
[2:20] and we have a lot of music nowadays and
[2:24] a lot of
[2:24] groups that are out there and and their
[2:27] songs they've got an anointed beat and
[2:30] and
[2:30] and they sing the praises to the lord
[2:33] and you listening to them and
[2:35] and it seems they've created an
[2:37] anointing and it seems to catch the
[2:39] spirit
[2:41] well the music's going on but it can't
[2:44] hold it
[2:47] it's just a man-made catch and
[2:50] and so it's just something that picks up
[2:52] the spirit and and it's man-made maybe
[2:54] sometimes you want to
[2:56] feel anointing or you want to feel
[2:58] something and you put on a certain song
[3:00] or you put on a certain group
[3:02] you know whether it's the hillslide
[3:04] singers or
[3:06] whatever that you you want you want to
[3:10] call it you know maybe it's some other
[3:12] uh
[3:13] a group you know what i mean like alpha
[3:16] and no
[3:17] omega it can all these different things
[3:19] that are out there that causes like an
[3:21] anointing
[3:22] and like something that's kind of
[3:24] uplifting but it don't last
[3:30] it's just a catch
[3:33] you know it's like talk shows and
[3:36] tv shows and and they they they sit
[3:40] there and they talk about god and
[3:42] what god's doing and and and they got
[3:45] all these ideas they're throwing out
[3:47] there and
[3:48] all this stuff they they put out there
[3:50] and a person just sits back
[3:52] eats it up wow wow
[3:55] they're stimulating your mind they're
[3:58] they're stimulating your thought they're
[4:00] you know they're begging for your money
[4:05] and they get you to think wow if i give
[4:08] i'm closer to god
[4:12] and it's just a catch
[4:15] and so that's what we're saying uh you
[4:18] talk about
[4:19] uh maybe some big emotional workup
[4:23] you know just get you that emotion get
[4:26] get it worked up and and
[4:28] you know tears coming down the eye i
[4:29] went to see some gospel music one time i
[4:32] i wasn't really a fan of going to gospel
[4:35] music but
[4:36] i thought i'll go to this gospel show
[4:39] and i got there and the the lady was
[4:43] there and
[4:43] and she was singing her song and she had
[4:45] a little hanky you know like this and
[4:48] and everything and she started talking
[4:50] about fixing her mama's hair
[4:54] you know when she she was gonna bury her
[4:57] oh just cry oh
[5:01] man i got the feeling my heart i just
[5:04] was feeling so sorry for her
[5:06] yeah she had to fix her mama's hair
[5:08] before she buried her and
[5:10] then everything and she said the lord
[5:11] put this heart on my
[5:13] my songs for mama i said oh mama
[5:19] and my heart was just bleeding and she
[5:21] started singing about that and
[5:23] everything
[5:24] and i i just felt like this got caught
[5:27] up in the spirit of it
[5:28] and everything and and i thought oh this
[5:31] is wonderful
[5:33] well then i had some friends come into
[5:35] town and i thought well they might enjoy
[5:36] this so i go out the second night
[5:40] and they sing this song and all of a
[5:42] sudden she says oh
[5:44] i i fixed my mama's hair
[5:48] i said what
[5:53] you just told that story last night
[5:56] you mean that was fake i'm not saying it
[6:00] was fake that cheap
[6:01] but remember but it was an emotional
[6:04] workup
[6:05] it was designed to catch the spirit
[6:08] it was a man-made catch
[6:14] something that that that wouldn't last
[6:19] i thought if that was genuine it would
[6:21] have stuck but no
[6:22] okay it just goes there it just caught
[6:24] me up it it catches you up
[6:26] and that's what they do big emotional
[6:28] workups big
[6:30] big anointings that that people come on
[6:33] with that emotion and
[6:34] that anointing and that style and
[6:37] everything and it catches it
[6:39] but that's not the evidence of what's
[6:41] really of god or not
[6:45] it doesn't hold any water
[6:49] it's a temporary catch
[6:52] and that's what we're asking ourselves
[6:54] this identification that the prophet of
[6:57] god's giving of his sister
[6:59] he says this is what a cistern does this
[7:02] is what a man-made
[7:03] catch does this is something that
[7:05] catches the water
[7:07] but it's man-made and that's what they
[7:10] did they departed from him
[7:12] to catch something that was man-made
[7:15] it's like
[7:16] programs and systems
[7:19] and rituals
[7:23] i've had the opportunity of course i was
[7:25] raised a catholic
[7:27] so i know what it was like to sit into
[7:29] the catholic church
[7:31] and go through the mass and feel the
[7:33] weight
[7:34] of that ritual and that organ plan i've
[7:37] been to a methodist service
[7:39] and a baptist service when that preacher
[7:41] comes to that point
[7:42] where he starts to make that altar call
[7:45] and he brings you can just feel that
[7:47] presence
[7:48] of that call of that ritual
[7:51] that that takes place but all those
[7:53] things are man-made catches
[7:56] they catch the spirit for a
[8:00] little season just for a time
[8:05] but but they can't hold it
[8:09] it leaks out so now as we talk about
[8:13] you know a
[8:17] one man or the
[8:20] evidence of a one-person denomination so
[8:24] we're saying is a is
[8:26] a cistern so if the denomination is made
[8:31] up of
[8:32] people then all those individuals
[8:35] in that system have that spirit
[8:40] they may not want to have it and god
[8:42] provides a way out of it
[8:45] but if the characteristics that apply to
[8:48] the denominations
[8:49] apply to us
[8:53] and then we can see the same
[8:55] characteristics that they have
[8:57] then we might say hey i might be
[9:02] one myself
[9:06] like if chickenpox is little bumps and
[9:10] itches and a rash and everything that
[9:13] goes on it you see all the symptoms of
[9:16] it
[9:16] and then you sit there and they say well
[9:18] i got bumps
[9:20] i've got rash i've got fever
[9:24] i've got every single thing that's
[9:26] identified here
[9:27] it's happening in me might it be that
[9:30] you have pox too
[9:35] so might it be if we can look at these
[9:37] characteristics
[9:39] and we can see what transpires and
[9:42] what's evidence why
[9:44] god hated what they did he said be a
[9:47] hoard of it
[9:50] in other words listen to what he says he
[9:53] says
[9:54] uh he says be astonished
[10:00] oh heavens at this
[10:05] and be horribly afraid be very desolate
[10:10] saith the lord so in other words he's
[10:12] saying don't take it lightly
[10:15] don't take this lightly consider it
[10:19] look at what they've done they've made
[10:21] gods that aren't gods
[10:24] tell me that ain't the truth today we
[10:26] got tv gods we've got
[10:28] singer gods and movie star gods and car
[10:32] gods and
[10:33] everything make things gods that aren't
[10:35] god
[10:38] and they've taken their glory
[10:42] and they've changed their glory
[10:45] for that which doth not
[10:48] profit he says for this
[10:52] be fearful shake yourselves
[10:57] don't don't let this don't miss this
[11:00] understand what's transpiring here that
[11:03] that the the cistern is something that
[11:07] only catches something that's man-made
[11:10] so let's look at it it says they they
[11:13] catch a spirit but it leaks out
[11:15] so what is a cistern a cistern is
[11:18] something
[11:18] man-made
[11:22] but it'll get empty
[11:28] it'll have water when it rains
[11:31] and what does water represent
[11:34] water represents revival
[11:38] that's what it is but a cistern
[11:42] it'll get empty and a cistern can't fill
[11:46] itself
[11:48] it's not reliable so
[11:51] that's one thing so if you find in your
[11:54] life
[11:55] that you just get empty
[11:59] that that you've got to rely on a
[12:01] revival
[12:03] you've got to rely on something that
[12:05] that come by
[12:07] some sort of thing to help catch the
[12:09] spirit
[12:10] then then you sit back and you say oh my
[12:15] look at me if i if i'm empty and he says
[12:18] now a denomination
[12:19] it gets empty
[12:23] it just gets so formal it just gets so
[12:26] touched to a place
[12:27] that it becomes it becomes total
[12:31] totally empty because it's something
[12:34] that's man-made and something that's
[12:37] man-made can't hold god's water
[12:43] so a cistern will get empty the cistern
[12:46] cannot
[12:47] fill itself it's not reliable
[12:50] you can't rely on it
[12:54] you can't put all you just can't put all
[12:56] your trust in it
[12:58] amen you know a song might anoint you
[13:01] one time
[13:02] and you really might take comfort from
[13:04] it but after you heard it 50 times
[13:08] then all of a sudden you don't like the
[13:10] beat no more
[13:12] you don't like the song in fact you need
[13:14] a new song
[13:17] you need a new group
[13:20] you need something else to move you
[13:24] it's not reliable the emotion you'll
[13:27] find
[13:27] out that you you might listen and you
[13:30] might talk
[13:31] and you might find out and this is a
[13:33] type of a denomination
[13:34] and we're finding it now in the hour
[13:37] that we're living
[13:38] people have been in these denominations
[13:40] so long they've listened to the same
[13:42] thing for so long
[13:43] they're hungry it doesn't satisfy him
[13:46] anymore
[13:47] they're they're looking for a real drink
[13:49] they're not looking for another man-made
[13:51] cistern
[13:53] they're not looking for a cistern with a
[13:55] different name on it
[13:56] they're looking for something that's
[13:58] genuine and that's what man's done is
[14:00] they've
[14:01] left the fountain of the living water
[14:03] they've left the
[14:05] what god's provided and they went and
[14:07] provided something for themselves
[14:10] and they're finding out it's not
[14:11] reliable
[14:14] and it can't fill itself
[14:18] it needs something else to renew it and
[14:20] if
[14:21] it needs a revival it needs a rain
[14:24] to come something to work it up some
[14:26] something to
[14:28] create an atmosphere that that they can
[14:31] do it but i hope to think that we
[14:33] wouldn't get to the place
[14:34] that we'd have to have meetings and and
[14:37] people in
[14:37] all the time to pump us up and to work
[14:40] us
[14:41] up if look at yourself
[14:45] if that's the way another if you can't
[14:47] go
[14:48] on your own
[14:51] and you're always getting emptied out
[14:53] and you're always just feeling that
[14:55] that there's no god around and you need
[14:58] some
[14:59] catch and that could be a preacher
[15:04] a certain ministry a certain preacher
[15:07] that rings your belt
[15:14] like i said it could be certain music it
[15:15] could be certain conversation
[15:20] but but we'll get into the other
[15:23] but so there's there's certain things
[15:25] about uh
[15:27] about a cistern that are
[15:30] are so uh identified in
[15:34] and so that's what we say it's not
[15:38] revival
[15:39] you can't count on it it
[15:43] to remain the same
[15:47] it's always changing
[15:50] then that's what happens it's always
[15:52] changing if it's not full
[15:55] the same all the time it's got different
[15:57] water in it it's got
[15:58] different color water in it it just
[16:01] changes
[16:02] so there's characteristics about
[16:05] something that's man-made and we can
[16:08] apply these characteristics and now what
[16:10] we're doing this morning
[16:11] we're examining ourselves by god's word
[16:16] to find out am i just
[16:20] catching the spirit without having it
[16:26] so the you know so it identifies
[16:31] of some man-made thing it's a type of
[16:34] denomination
[16:36] large
[16:39] are one person it has the same
[16:43] identities
[16:44] and another thing about a a
[16:47] cistern or something that's man-made
[16:51] is that the water just stands there
[16:57] you understand like if you've just come
[16:59] up
[17:00] all the time in your life to the same
[17:02] spiritual level
[17:04] you're at the same place it just seems
[17:07] like
[17:08] you come to this spot and you're there
[17:10] for a while
[17:11] and then it leaks out you just get empty
[17:16] okay and then maybe when you start to
[17:19] see that you might think well there
[17:21] there's something more i might not have
[17:23] something here
[17:24] that's as genuine as i want it to be
[17:27] i might have something here that's not
[17:29] really satisfying me
[17:31] and that's what it does it just gets
[17:33] stagnant
[17:34] and you know that's what happened to
[17:36] israel they just got the
[17:38] manna they just didn't want it no more
[17:44] just stagnant and
[17:48] it just sits it's always the same it
[17:50] just sits there
[17:52] he says he says after a few days you let
[17:54] the water stand there
[17:56] and it becomes stagnant
[17:59] you let the water stand in a cistern it
[18:02] becomes stagnant you can put that on the
[18:03] board if you can paragraph 39.
[18:09] can you find that
[18:14] i don't know if they can i know we had
[18:16] it technology
[18:18] broken sister and paragraph
[18:22] 39. he says in a few days
[18:25] you let the water stand there and it
[18:28] becomes stagnant
[18:29] you let the water stand in a cistern it
[18:32] becomes stagnated
[18:35] it gets full of frogs and lizards
[18:39] and snakes and we used to call it wiggle
[18:43] tails
[18:44] little bitty i don't know whether
[18:47] they're
[18:48] not a parasite there i cannot i don't
[18:51] know what to call
[18:52] them but some little thing gets in the
[18:55] water
[18:56] what we called it wiggle tails you know
[18:58] what it is
[19:00] how many knows what i'm talking about
[19:02] why sure all you country folks
[19:05] know you get it all full of stagnant
[19:09] and them that loves stagnation
[19:12] comes with it it actually
[19:15] comes because it's stagnated and it
[19:19] because it's stagnated it draws the
[19:22] animals there that like stagnant things
[19:27] think of it so what happens it
[19:31] draws people you know if you get
[19:34] stagnant religion people can be around
[19:36] you
[19:38] snakes can come around you and frogs can
[19:40] come around you
[19:41] and lizards can because they're
[19:44] attracted to somebody that's not
[19:45] stagnant
[19:46] if your religion just gets to a place
[19:49] where they're comfortable with it and
[19:51] they can deal
[19:52] with it you know they know you're going
[19:54] to be the same
[19:55] they know you're not going to go any
[19:57] farther they know you're not going to
[19:58] get any harder
[20:00] oh that lizard can handle that
[20:05] that snake can handle that
[20:09] because that's what it draws they're
[20:11] attracted to a
[20:12] a a a man-made something
[20:17] they find identity in it
[20:21] it doesn't convict them
[20:24] that all stagnant water don't convict
[20:26] the snake
[20:28] they don't convict the lizard it don't
[20:29] convict any of them
[20:32] it's happy the paragraph 40 will keep
[20:36] going
[20:38] so it attracts those things
[20:41] so you can look at ourselves what does
[20:44] our denomination track
[20:48] what comes in well i'll tell you
[20:52] what living water attracts it attracts
[20:54] somebody that's thirsty
[20:56] [Music]
[20:58] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[21:00] after righteousness
[21:02] for they shall be filled that's what the
[21:05] living water attracts
[21:06] it attracts people that are thirsty
[21:12] but that old stagnant water they kind of
[21:15] like the taste of that
[21:21] he says that's a whole lot like our
[21:24] churches
[21:26] today
[21:29] think i think that we have left
[21:32] one of our greatest sins that the church
[21:35] has done today
[21:37] just like israel it left him
[21:40] the fountain of living water and has
[21:43] hewed to themselves out man-made
[21:45] cisterns
[21:47] and it becomes a habitation
[21:50] of everything that loves that kind of
[21:53] water
[21:55] lizards frogs all kinds of unclean
[21:58] germs live in it because it's man-made
[22:01] tank and in this tank these things stay
[22:06] a perfect example of our denominations
[22:10] today so like i said
[22:15] is it a a one-man denomination or
[22:18] or or uh whether it's not
[22:22] what what happens is is that what
[22:26] happens
[22:26] everything washes into a cistern
[22:33] everything it flows off of everything
[22:35] that's dirty
[22:37] it flows off of the barnyard it flows
[22:39] from the
[22:40] water it just in other words it catches
[22:43] everything
[22:45] it's just it's just uh a filthy thing so
[22:49] we can see that
[22:52] denominations and the denominational
[22:56] man-made catch
[22:58] that catch a little bit of the spirit
[23:00] here a little bit of the spirit there
[23:05] but everything comes into it
[23:07] everything's there
[23:09] uh everything just kind of
[23:13] washes into it and i might just get out
[23:17] of my
[23:18] uh context just a little bit but
[23:22] he says here in paragraph 48
[23:29] he says now i'm linking that
[23:33] denominations i'm linking that to these
[23:35] dirty
[23:36] filthy cisterns he is the fountain
[23:40] of life he is the living water
[23:45] um a man leave that and dig for
[23:49] themselves
[23:50] cisterns which can only catch filth
[23:54] that's the only thing it can catch
[23:57] and that's what denomination does it
[24:00] catches
[24:01] everything that comes along and wants to
[24:05] join
[24:06] that's what that's what it does it
[24:08] catches every doctrine that comes along
[24:11] every spirit that comes along every
[24:13] anointing that comes along
[24:15] everything that comes along every new
[24:17] idea every new thrill
[24:19] every new annoying it just catches it
[24:22] anything that wants to come along
[24:24] they catch it
[24:28] it's just what it does they're willing
[24:31] to take
[24:33] it in if it's got some money or can
[24:35] dress in a certain way
[24:37] no matter who they are or where they
[24:40] come from
[24:41] they take them in anyhow
[24:46] now they asked brother branham they said
[24:48] now see brother brown
[24:50] why do you strike at those things
[24:54] those people so hard
[24:58] why why is he striking against this
[25:02] so hard click just look if we go to
[25:07] uh up there in paragraph 41
[25:10] and we'll just talk about it this
[25:12] morning he says
[25:13] why do you strike at it so hard he says
[25:16] it ought to be struck
[25:17] at flee it
[25:22] because it will finally form the mark of
[25:26] the beast
[25:28] remember that is the truth
[25:32] it will be the mark of the beast the
[25:34] nominations will lead
[25:36] right to it it's on the road right now
[25:41] to force by a power
[25:44] so in other words whether it's a
[25:47] one-person denomination
[25:50] somebody that's catching everything
[25:53] because someone that
[25:54] that gets empty all the time that
[25:57] everything leaks out the spirit leaks
[26:00] out
[26:00] it's man-made whether it's the whole
[26:03] group
[26:04] big or small it leads to the mark of the
[26:08] beast
[26:11] right he said
[26:14] paragraph 42 look in the old roman
[26:18] empire that's exactly what led them
[26:21] to the mark of apostasy
[26:25] you found out that no man could buy or
[26:28] sell
[26:29] without the mark of the beast he had
[26:33] he had to have it he's talking about
[26:36] rome
[26:38] natural rome right
[26:41] he says there's only two classes of
[26:44] people
[26:44] who will be on earth so now there's
[26:48] only going to be two classes of people
[26:50] here on earth
[26:52] remember he said be astonished be amazed
[26:56] be desolate be desperate
[27:01] that's what happened when something
[27:02] becomes stagnant
[27:06] just another gospel i
[27:09] i've heard this before there's no new
[27:12] nothing new to it
[27:16] there's only two classes of people
[27:18] beyond the earth those with the seal of
[27:20] god
[27:21] and those with the mark of the beast
[27:24] only two classes
[27:25] you'll have to have one or
[27:29] the other it will be
[27:32] an apostasy a mark
[27:35] of religion apostate
[27:38] religion you know what apostate means
[27:41] religion
[27:42] without god
[27:46] that's what it'll be it's a spirit
[27:49] it's an apostate religion they
[27:52] they they force it
[27:55] on people by society
[28:00] by social teaching by
[28:03] education they they
[28:06] they force and they preach a luke
[28:10] warm worldly
[28:14] mixed filthy everything
[28:17] washed into it everything joined in it
[28:21] in fact if you preach separation if you
[28:23] speak
[28:24] separation from homosexuality if you
[28:27] preach separation from adultery
[28:29] if you beat separation from alcoholism
[28:32] and sin and everything they mark you
[28:41] you know how bad it's getting they're
[28:44] what they're trying to teach
[28:45] young teenagers to take
[28:49] hormone shots to slow up
[28:52] puberty so they won't develop into a man
[28:56] or a woman and tell that they can pick
[29:01] pick sick
[29:10] you know that because that's the
[29:12] greatest sin
[29:15] of being prejudiced and and
[29:19] this all this racism and things
[29:22] can the potter say to the pot
[29:25] say to the potter why has you made me
[29:28] thus
[29:30] god made me an irishman praise god
[29:33] thank you lord for making me at all
[29:40] god's children aren't ashamed of how
[29:42] they're made they're
[29:43] thankful they're a burning light they're
[29:46] on fire for god
[29:48] thank you lord thank you lord amen
[29:53] but what are they doing they're forcing
[29:55] it on us
[29:57] feeding it down our throat every day
[30:00] that's why you've got to
[30:01] shut off all these other voices and hear
[30:04] the voice of god
[30:11] he says listen paragraph 44
[30:14] it's going to have a image unto the
[30:17] beast
[30:19] as we studied we find out that rome was
[30:22] it always will be
[30:26] or the beast exactly there is no other
[30:30] way to get to it
[30:31] anything else but rome rome
[30:34] is the beast the mark of the beast is
[30:38] the mark of
[30:39] romanism
[30:43] what do you think all the nations are
[30:45] they're daughters
[30:46] of rome same system
[30:50] same nickelodeon leadership
[30:56] nobody drinking from the fountain they
[30:59] drink from their
[31:00] man-made sister whether it's baptists
[31:03] they drink that
[31:04] baptist water it's stagnated if it's
[31:07] been the same thing
[31:11] it may bring you to the realization
[31:14] and the revelation that you need to
[31:16] repent from your sins
[31:18] and you're a sinner and i thank god for
[31:21] it
[31:21] i love listening to billy graham preach
[31:23] i told you how because those people
[31:25] because they're on the other side
[31:27] but i'll tell you once you get saved
[31:29] you've got to have more than salvation
[31:32] hey man you got to have a drink you got
[31:35] to have more
[31:35] god you got to know things you want to
[31:38] fellowship with them
[31:40] amen it's greater
[31:46] it's rome what did what did rome do
[31:51] was converted from pagan rome unto papal
[31:55] rome
[31:56] an organized system
[31:59] a universal system that
[32:02] forced everybody
[32:05] to that one religion or be put to death
[32:11] that's what it did
[32:17] isn't it strange thing that this united
[32:21] states appears
[32:23] on the scene it's like a lamb
[32:29] and the lamb has two small horns
[32:32] civil and ecclesiastical
[32:40] rights
[32:43] civil rights is one of its horns
[32:47] ecclesiastical rights is another one of
[32:50] his horns
[32:51] in other words you can't preach against
[32:53] this you can't preach against that
[33:02] you can't say these things
[33:05] it's forcing something let's just read
[33:11] ecclesiastical rights and after a while
[33:14] when that was a lamb we found out that
[33:17] it spoke
[33:18] like a dragon and it exercised
[33:21] all the power of the dragon had before
[33:25] it
[33:26] and the bible tells us that and says let
[33:29] us make an image unto the beast
[33:34] an image unto rome they had caesar
[33:39] they now the denominational systems has
[33:41] a bicker of christ
[33:43] look what it's going it's an image of
[33:45] something
[33:47] like something else
[33:52] what can we see and we can see it right
[33:55] now
[33:56] in that of apostolic condition
[34:00] the church is forming the world council
[34:03] of churches
[34:05] now it's not a council like everybody
[34:08] sitting at the table
[34:11] counsel is it's all preaching the same
[34:14] thing
[34:15] it all has the same approach it all
[34:18] has the same attitude this luke warm
[34:22] uh no standing for any righteousness no
[34:25] standing for
[34:26] any everybody's saved you're all fine
[34:29] you're all good whether you're a one
[34:32] denomination or whether
[34:34] you're a great big denomination it
[34:36] forces your
[34:37] mind into accepting
[34:40] and believing a religion that's got no
[34:46] life
[34:50] accepting salvation without the spirit
[34:53] of christ
[34:54] to quicken you people believe they're
[34:58] saved
[34:59] by this lying counsel counsel means
[35:02] someone that gives advice
[35:04] somebody that teaches something that set
[35:06] an example
[35:07] that oh you can just go in with your
[35:09] hair all bobbed off and your earrings on
[35:12] your
[35:12] dress up to here and a wiener
[35:14] wiener-type dress
[35:16] and all these v-cut stuff and no
[35:18] shoulders
[35:19] and you can look everywhere you want
[35:21] with all kinds of sex appeal and praise
[35:23] god
[35:26] nice to have you today it catches
[35:29] everything
[35:30] everything that comes in every spirit
[35:33] that comes in
[35:34] no matter where it's from
[35:39] but it is it's it's it's
[35:42] it's here the prophet of god said it was
[35:45] here we just read it
[35:47] the world council of churches which is
[35:49] the image to the power
[35:52] of rome
[35:55] it's an image it's daughters
[35:59] to the power of rome what was the power
[36:02] of wrong what
[36:03] power did they take that was such
[36:06] obnoxious to god
[36:12] taking and the forgiveness
[36:15] of sins praying to saints
[36:19] giving out penance for sins and
[36:22] collecting money for it
[36:26] there's only one who forgives sins
[36:29] there's only
[36:30] one mediator between god and man and
[36:32] that's the man jesus christ
[36:35] world council churches which is the
[36:37] image and the power of rome
[36:39] and will force upon the people the same
[36:42] thing that pagan rome did
[36:44] or papal rome did there is no other way
[36:48] no other thing but that is the truth
[36:54] and that's why i'm striking it in my age
[36:58] in my time because it's got to be struck
[37:01] at
[37:02] that calling
[37:05] that coming in to
[37:08] it's got to be struck at that coming
[37:11] into
[37:12] come out of her my people
[37:16] that ye be not partakers
[37:19] of her sins
[37:23] now i'm putting it this morning as
[37:26] an individual call come out of that
[37:30] condition
[37:32] come out of that denominational
[37:34] condition come out of that
[37:36] cistern quit drinking that cistern water
[37:43] that's full of all kinds of worldlyism i
[37:46] remember i heard a song one time i
[37:48] really liked that song
[37:49] the words of it kind of identified with
[37:51] me so i thought i'd go see the artist
[37:55] oh my goodness i thought lucifer wrote
[37:58] this thing
[38:04] but we don't want to stand for anything
[38:08] what look at this spirit this world
[38:11] council of churches
[38:12] this ecumenical movement we're all
[38:14] brothers
[38:17] you've got somebody that believes the
[38:19] pope is sitting in a throne
[38:22] as the vicar of christ that the body
[38:25] this little host is the literal body the
[38:28] literal blood
[38:30] that the priest is the one that forgives
[38:32] sins
[38:33] the priest has the power to forgive sins
[38:36] and that you can say a few hail marys
[38:39] and a few glory bees
[38:41] and that's what washes your sins away
[38:46] and then somebody that professes
[38:50] that nobody comes to the father but by
[38:52] me
[38:55] that confesses that there's only one
[38:58] person that saves you
[39:00] and how can those two spirits
[39:07] join together
[39:10] in a council or an ecumenical movement
[39:15] thinking that they're going to bring
[39:18] christ to all the world
[39:22] they're not bringing christ
[39:26] they're bringing the mark of the beast
[39:32] they're putting them as slaves that's
[39:35] real slavery
[39:37] real slavery is the slavery of sin
[39:42] amen they asked brother branham about it
[39:45] he said
[39:46] he said god allowed that that
[39:50] move to bring those people to this
[39:52] country
[39:53] so that they could receive the gospel
[39:56] that they can receive the baptism of the
[39:58] holy spirit
[39:59] that they can have eternal life once
[40:02] you've got eternal life this life don't
[40:04] mean nothing to you
[40:12] a lot of people have had hardships it's
[40:15] a sickness of sin
[40:17] but oh hallelujah
[40:23] he says he says
[40:27] and that's why i'm striking at it did i
[40:30] did i finish form the world council of
[40:32] churches paper room
[40:33] it's nothing but it's rome so
[40:36] so what happens it you you you take on
[40:40] the
[40:41] uh uh you you take on the uh
[40:45] romanism is what it is
[40:49] it's a type of denomination it's just
[40:52] that's exactly what it is
[40:54] if some some time we have our our own
[40:57] little ideas
[40:59] and our own little doctrines
[41:02] we make up our own you know
[41:06] if you ever want to filter yourself
[41:08] filter yourself through god's word
[41:13] so that's what it's doing and so he
[41:16] he said because it leads to the mark of
[41:18] the beast the mark of rome
[41:21] think of it as the mark of rome
[41:26] in other words if it's not the true word
[41:29] of god it's catholic
[41:33] i don't care what blasphemous name you
[41:36] put on it
[41:39] it's still birthed by the system
[41:44] you got time for a little bit of bible
[41:46] study if we go late
[41:48] this morning if you have to go just get
[41:50] up and go
[41:51] if you if you want to be baptized
[41:54] another day i understand let's just
[41:55] finish reading this
[41:57] now i'm linking that to these dirty
[42:00] filthy sisters
[42:02] he is the fountain of life he is the
[42:04] living water
[42:06] and a man that leaves that and did for
[42:09] themselves
[42:09] cisterns which can only catch the filth
[42:13] that's the only thing it can catch
[42:16] that's what denominationalism does
[42:19] it catches everything that comes along
[42:21] and wants to join
[42:23] they're willing to take it in if it's
[42:26] got some money
[42:27] or it can dress a certain way no matter
[42:30] who they are
[42:32] where they come from they take it in
[42:35] anyhow
[42:36] paragraph 49 now we
[42:39] find again that this mark of the beast
[42:43] was formed here
[42:48] america
[42:53] is number 13 it was born with 13
[42:57] colonies
[42:58] it had a flag that had 13 stars
[43:01] 13 stripes and it even appears in
[43:05] revelations the 13th chapter
[43:07] and america has always been a woman
[43:11] represented in our coins even the indian
[43:15] head
[43:16] on a penny it's a woman's profile
[43:19] we know that we know the history of it
[43:22] everything is
[43:23] liberty bell everything else the liberty
[43:27] the statue of liberty everything's a
[43:29] woman
[43:30] a woman number 13. now it's a beautiful
[43:33] thing
[43:34] for us to see those things
[43:40] let's turn to revelations 13.
[43:43] if you get tired then like i said uh
[43:47] just say brother mcgary we're done
[43:52] or i'm done or whatever or please get
[43:55] done
[44:06] america
[44:10] america rose up out of the ocean right
[44:12] out of the sea you know that
[44:14] revelations 13 and i stood upon the sand
[44:18] of the sea and saw a beast rise
[44:22] up out of the sea having seven heads
[44:26] and seven horns and upon his horns was
[44:29] ten crowns
[44:31] and upon his head was the names of
[44:34] blasphemy
[44:36] when you know those names right baptist
[44:38] methodist perpetrator
[44:40] and the beast which i saw was like a
[44:42] leopard
[44:43] and his feet were as the feet of a bear
[44:46] and his mouth as a mouth of a lion
[44:49] and a dragon give him his power
[44:52] and his seat and great authority
[44:56] there's that rome again and i saw
[44:59] one of his heads as it were wounded
[45:03] to death and his deadly wounds
[45:07] were healed and all the world
[45:10] wondered after the beast and they
[45:13] worshipped the dragon
[45:15] which gave power unto the beast
[45:18] and they worshipped the beast saying
[45:23] who is likened unto the beast who is
[45:26] able
[45:27] to make war with it now who's the beast
[45:31] it's rome
[45:34] satan was smote at calvary but
[45:37] he shook that wound off right and he
[45:40] continued
[45:41] and there was given unto him a mouth
[45:44] speaking great things and blasphemies
[45:49] trinitarian doctrine saints
[45:52] and the power was given unto him to
[45:54] continue
[45:55] forty in two months and he opened his
[45:59] mouth
[45:59] and blasphemed against god to blaspheme
[46:02] his
[46:03] name and his tabernacle in them
[46:06] that dwelt in heaven
[46:09] and it was given unto him to make war
[46:12] with the saints
[46:14] didn't he do that he slaughtered them
[46:21] and overcome them and power was given
[46:24] him
[46:25] over all kindreds and tongues and
[46:27] nations
[46:28] there's your dark ages
[46:31] right okay but he was wounded and then
[46:34] and let's just
[46:35] read up here and it says
[46:39] and all that dwelt on the earth shall
[46:41] worship him
[46:42] whose names are not written
[46:45] in the book of life of the lamb
[46:48] slain from the foundation of the world
[46:52] if any man hath ear let him hear
[46:56] he that leadeth unto captivity
[46:59] shall go into captivity he that killeth
[47:02] with the sword
[47:04] must be killed with the sword hallelujah
[47:07] amen what is the word of god it's
[47:10] sharper
[47:10] than a two-edged sword church we can't
[47:14] sit around dumb
[47:18] you understand there's biblical prophecy
[47:20] coming to pass
[47:21] every day the book of revelations is the
[47:25] revelations of jesus christ
[47:29] and these are the things our prophet
[47:31] brought up to us in the seals
[47:32] and in the church ages he says
[47:37] he must be killed with the sword here is
[47:41] is the patience and the faith of the
[47:44] saints
[47:46] in the word of god listen and i beheld
[47:49] another beast come up
[47:51] out of the earth and had had two horns
[47:55] like a lamb and it spake as a dragon
[47:59] and it exercised all the power of the
[48:01] first beast before him
[48:04] and caused the earth in them which dwelt
[48:07] therein to worship the first beast
[48:09] whose deadly wounds was healed
[48:14] what did it do luther come up
[48:17] and and and and struck it right
[48:21] look at the two the horse riders the
[48:24] horse rider started out first the white
[48:27] right and then and then a a
[48:31] a red and then a black
[48:34] the whole world went into darkness the
[48:37] seed went into the ground
[48:39] why because that that beast
[48:42] rome was going to prevail and all of a
[48:45] sudden what comes up
[48:46] luther comes up amen it strikes a wound
[48:51] cleo let come out of it but what
[48:53] happened that spirit prevailed
[48:56] and it denominated
[49:01] it denominated them it gobbled them up
[49:04] and sucked them into the same system god
[49:07] sent out a beat
[49:08] a a beast to speak against it
[49:12] he sent out a lion
[49:16] and then he he sent out an ox
[49:21] which was a spirit that allowed him to
[49:23] be martyred
[49:24] and to be to slain when he ward against
[49:28] the saints
[49:28] there was a spirit on the saints
[49:31] protecting them
[49:32] amen we're talking about what happens
[49:37] if you've got something that's man-made
[49:40] your own mind-made message ideas
[49:44] your own little man-made things if
[49:46] you're a one-man denomination
[49:48] you end up with the mark of the beast
[49:52] he said and so we see it and then
[49:56] then comes reformers
[50:00] luther comes out and he begins to preach
[50:03] against it
[50:04] and they come out of it but what does
[50:08] the beast do
[50:09] he prevails
[50:15] then wesley comes
[50:18] and he preaches and i love the people
[50:21] out of the wesleyan revival
[50:23] charles persian and those great
[50:26] evangelists of them days
[50:28] they're inspiring
[50:31] but what happened they got gobbled up
[50:36] you know they said charles virgin smoked
[50:38] a cigar
[50:39] you know why because the doctor told him
[50:42] it was good for him
[50:44] it would help him preach better again it
[50:47] would help him
[50:49] do better but you know the lord dealt
[50:52] with them
[50:53] and he gave it up amen
[50:57] and we see these beasts and we see this
[51:00] thing coming
[51:02] so we see that spirit coming up then god
[51:04] sent
[51:05] men and the reformers and it got
[51:07] denominated
[51:08] and it got denominated and finally it
[51:11] comes to this age
[51:14] this is the age that the eagle went for
[51:18] amen can the eagle's a what a seer
[51:22] isn't that what he said blessed
[51:26] it's beautiful to see those things
[51:29] and what did the eagle do it showed us
[51:32] it opened the seals and
[51:33] showed us this spirit coming up
[51:36] to this day when it was finally going to
[51:41] form into the worship of the beast
[51:45] the world council of churches but god
[51:48] also
[51:49] had beast and the last beast is an eagle
[51:53] and that calls out a bride
[51:57] and now it comes to a time where the
[52:02] bride
[52:04] and the beast are meeting right now
[52:15] the battle's on right now it's right now
[52:19] that that this spirit
[52:23] is forcing people to accept its mark
[52:28] which is on the mind and the hand
[52:31] and it's forcing people to accept
[52:35] the lukewarm preaching of the gospel
[52:40] as satisfied water
[52:45] it's forcing people to drink and to
[52:48] settle
[52:49] for a drink from something man-made
[52:53] i thank god for a life-living
[52:57] word message
[53:00] it's forcing them into those things he
[53:04] said in paragraph 58 and i spoke against
[53:06] the nomination
[53:07] systems right then and i still believe
[53:10] tonight
[53:11] that it's a cesspool that it's a place
[53:14] where a filth runs into it i can't
[53:17] believe that god would ever take
[53:19] such a thing in his church
[53:22] because it's got to be born of the
[53:25] spirit of god
[53:27] then cleanse before it can be called his
[53:30] the mystical body of christ we are
[53:33] baptized
[53:35] into it by baptism of the holy ghost
[53:40] paragraph 61 and we are invited like
[53:44] israel so it is now
[53:48] to look to israel for examples
[53:54] they as long as they stayed with the
[53:56] fountain
[53:58] they were all right but when they got
[54:02] to hewing themselves out cisterns
[54:06] and man-made systems then god left them
[54:09] flat
[54:11] he'll do us the same
[54:19] they have forsook him the fountain of
[54:22] living water
[54:24] that was the complaint that god had
[54:28] against them they made something
[54:31] that they could say see what we've done
[54:37] and when in times of the travel of moses
[54:41] when god by grace gave them a prophet
[54:45] and gave them a pillar of fire to go
[54:48] before them
[54:50] and vindicated it by signs and wonders
[54:53] grace had provided all those things
[54:57] israel still wanted
[55:01] and saw law they refused the grace to
[55:04] take law
[55:06] that's exactly what the people does
[55:08] today
[55:09] they refuse the word to take a
[55:12] denominational system
[55:14] because in that they
[55:17] can do what they want
[55:21] to and get away with it
[55:24] but you can't do it in christ
[55:28] you've got to come clean and clear
[55:32] in order to be in christ
[55:37] leaving the artesian well for a man-made
[55:41] system or cisterns
[55:44] could you imagine someone doing that
[55:48] could you imagine the mental condition
[55:50] of people
[55:52] that could drink at a fresh artesian
[55:54] well
[55:56] and would leave that
[56:01] for a man-made cistern with frogs
[56:04] lizards wiggle tails and everything else
[56:08] it don't seem even sensible to be right
[56:12] but that's just exactly what the people
[56:15] has done
[56:16] they left the word the true
[56:20] fountain of god's source
[56:23] and power
[56:27] now let me tell you it's the fountain
[56:31] that's the source of the power the word
[56:34] is letter and it killeth but the
[56:38] living waters what gives the word its
[56:42] power
[56:45] it's god's source of power to drink
[56:48] out of a cistern and make themselves
[56:51] cisterns
[56:53] same as they did then they've done the
[56:56] same thing now
[57:00] and then we're going to play 15 minutes
[57:04] it's
[57:04] 12 o'clock but we'll be good
[57:08] and that's the same way this is
[57:10] paragraph 65
[57:14] and that's the way it is with a lot of
[57:17] these
[57:18] parasites today you can't
[57:21] live in fresh water of the holy spirit
[57:25] that's the reason they'll serve so
[57:27] firmly against the word
[57:30] and say it contradicts itself
[57:34] there is nothing to it because they have
[57:38] some kind of stagnant pool
[57:41] to to wiggle in
[57:46] stagnant do you know the people that
[57:48] have left the message if you talk to
[57:50] them a little while
[57:51] it they just got tired of it
[57:55] it never brought them any higher
[57:58] it was the same old stories the same old
[58:01] gospel
[58:02] the same old every day kept looking back
[58:06] kept looking back
[58:09] they never saw what was revealed
[58:13] was the artesian whale
[58:16] he says that's the same way it is with
[58:20] frogs
[58:21] and lizards and with tadpoles and such
[58:24] as that
[58:25] they've got to get around the swamp or
[58:28] the stagnant pool
[58:29] to live for it's their nature
[58:33] to live there and you can't change the
[58:36] animal
[58:37] until you change its nature and you
[58:40] cannot make a man see
[58:42] the word of god till his nature has been
[58:46] changed
[58:47] and when his nature has changed from
[58:49] what he is
[58:51] to a son of god and the holy spirit
[58:53] comes into him
[58:55] the holy spirit wrote the word so if the
[58:58] holy spirit wrote the word
[59:00] the word bears witness of the holy
[59:03] spirit
[59:04] now we talked about the cistern right
[59:08] we talked about its characteristics
[59:11] anything could live there it catches
[59:14] everything
[59:15] it just gets stagnant living in the same
[59:18] place
[59:19] all the time same doctrine
[59:22] same revelation same routine
[59:28] but let's i was going to preach this
[59:30] next part but i thought you know
[59:33] i'd like us all to listen
[59:37] to brother branham preach about the
[59:40] artesian well
[59:44] what it god has provided for
[59:48] us to drink from and what its
[59:52] characteristics are
[59:55] what what are we know what the
[59:56] characteristics of an art
[59:58] of a cistern is gets old it gets
[1:00:01] stagnant
[1:00:01] it's filthy it's empty it doesn't hold
[1:00:04] water
[1:00:05] you can't rely on it the only time it's
[1:00:07] filled up is when there's a revival
[1:00:11] but listen to brother branham talk about
[1:00:13] what it happens
[1:00:14] what that living fountain was that they
[1:00:18] walked away from
[1:00:19] i just couldn't preach it like he could
[1:00:22] preach it
[1:00:23] but these are some of the things he says
[1:00:25] about that fountain and we'll listen to
[1:00:27] it
[1:00:28] it's self-supporting it's living
[1:00:32] it's constantly changing bringing
[1:00:35] something new
[1:00:36] all the time it draws its resources from
[1:00:42] the eternal
[1:00:43] word of god are you good to listen to 15
[1:00:47] minutes
[1:00:48] amen amen and
[1:00:51] and and i invite you if you if if you
[1:00:54] can stand up if you're weary
[1:00:56] but
[1:01:00] this 15 minutes i think is wonderful
[1:01:04] and so i want to look at myself
[1:01:11] and say lord do i have a cistern
[1:01:16] am i a sister if not how do i get rid of
[1:01:20] this nature
[1:01:22] what do what do i do
[1:01:26] to not be stagnant what do i do
[1:01:30] not to be catching these lizards and
[1:01:32] these frogs
[1:01:34] and this bug juice what do i do
[1:01:37] let's listen as the messenger of the age
[1:01:40] who just told us this cistern this mark
[1:01:43] of the beast
[1:01:44] is forming it's forming right here
[1:01:48] now in america the image to the beast
[1:01:52] coming up taking the mark of the beast
[1:01:55] on our foreheads
[1:01:57] in our hands what's our way of escape
[1:02:00] what brings to us the seal of god
[1:02:06] amen can we play that brother mike
[1:02:10] brother davey broken cisterns

[1:02:15] phones i guess nowadays if you want to
[1:02:17] do notes
[1:02:18] i don't care just turn your ringer off
[1:02:22] as we listen to brother branham in
[1:02:24] broken cisterns
[1:02:27] talk to us about what god's
[1:02:30] answer is or what israel walked away
[1:02:34] from
[1:02:35] and let's examine ourselves and
[1:02:39] may god if you're away from this
[1:02:40] fountain may you come back to it
[1:02:43] this morning god bless you see
[1:02:47] denominations make stagnant pools where
[1:02:49] men can live with women and their women
[1:02:51] can carry on and
[1:02:52] cut their hair and wear shorts and
[1:02:54] anything else and call themselves
[1:02:56] christians but a genuine
[1:02:57] fountain hallelujah of the power of god
[1:03:00] it can't stay
[1:03:01] there because it pushes it out
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:04] i am the fountain of living waters
[1:03:09] they left me to dig themselves some
[1:03:12] cisterns
[1:03:13] now a fountain of living water we find
[1:03:16] out what is a fountain of living water
[1:03:19] we find out what the cistern is now what
[1:03:22] is a fountain of living water
[1:03:23] it's an artesian well an artesian well
[1:03:27] what's that brother brown
[1:03:28] it's a well that it's
[1:03:32] always comes from beneath and pushes
[1:03:35] this water out
[1:03:37] it's flowing all the time it is
[1:03:40] self-supporting always fresh and clean
[1:03:44] an artesian well a fountain of living
[1:03:46] water
[1:03:47] it's not dead stagnated it's living
[1:03:50] it's constantly changing bringing up
[1:03:53] something new all the time
[1:03:55] moving on coming from its resources
[1:04:00] it draws its resources from from its bed
[1:04:04] which is a still a fountain of living
[1:04:06] water spraying up
[1:04:08] self cleansing is clean pure
[1:04:11] clean water it's self-supporting you
[1:04:14] don't have to wait for the rains
[1:04:16] to fill its tank up
[1:04:20] it's always a bubbling up gives us water
[1:04:23] free
[1:04:24] you don't have to pump it wind it
[1:04:27] twist it or join it
[1:04:32] it's just a fountain of living waters
[1:04:36] you know you take these old cisterns you
[1:04:38] have to crank it and crank it and crank
[1:04:40] it and pump and everything
[1:04:41] to get a little less stagnated water out
[1:04:44] but a fountain of lean water gives it
[1:04:46] out free without pumping jordan anything
[1:04:48] else
[1:04:51] oh i'm glad for that fountain amen
[1:04:55] yes sir it needs no
[1:04:58] strainer on it to take the
[1:05:01] parasites out force coming so
[1:05:05] deep down there in the rock until
[1:05:08] there's no parasites there
[1:05:12] it don't have to have an educational rag
[1:05:15] hanging on it
[1:05:17] that's right some worldly made system of
[1:05:20] man-made denominational wisdom
[1:05:22] they'll tell you before a psychiatrist
[1:05:24] whether you're able to preach or not
[1:05:26] they don't have one of those filthy rags
[1:05:28] hanging on it
[1:05:30] it push it right off as soon as you put
[1:05:31] it on there
[1:05:33] you can't do it that well is bubbling up
[1:05:36] all the time you put one of them rags on
[1:05:38] it thought one out of the one side of
[1:05:39] the other
[1:05:40] they don't have no time for a
[1:05:42] denominational rag on it
[1:05:44] you don't need no filter no strainer no
[1:05:46] pumping no jerking no
[1:05:48] nothing else it's just there bubbling up
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:53] it don't have to depend on local rings
[1:05:56] to fill it up
[1:05:58] rings are revivals
[1:06:01] for that fountain that's at the fountain
[1:06:04] of life
[1:06:06] where the carcass is the eagles are
[1:06:07] gathered
[1:06:09] you don't have to pump up a revival you
[1:06:11] don't have to pump up nothing
[1:06:13] only thing you have to do is just come
[1:06:15] to the fountain it's
[1:06:16] always full of good fresh water
[1:06:20] and there's no end to it it just keeps
[1:06:23] on bubbling
[1:06:25] you don't have to go with the sisters
[1:06:26] say well if it rains and washes off the
[1:06:28] barn we'll have something to drink
[1:06:31] my mind not this that artesian well
[1:06:34] spurting forth good cold water all the
[1:06:36] time
[1:06:37] you can depend on it you don't have to
[1:06:39] say well i'll go to this old cistern
[1:06:41] we used to drink out of it but it hasn't
[1:06:42] rained in a long time
[1:06:44] i'll tell you it may be dry that's why
[1:06:47] some of these man-made systems are
[1:06:49] you can go in if you got a big something
[1:06:51] going on a big caboose selling something
[1:06:54] or
[1:06:54] or some kind of something going on a big
[1:06:56] parties and things going on bunk hole
[1:06:58] games and parties in the basement
[1:07:00] everything you might find a full house
[1:07:02] but where you go to where that fountain
[1:07:04] is bubbling up
[1:07:05] always the people are getting you a good
[1:07:07] cold drink of water
[1:07:08] you can depend on it say they haven't
[1:07:11] had a revival for 10 years
[1:07:13] if you live with that fountain she's
[1:07:14] always got a revival going on
[1:07:18] like the little welshman said or one
[1:07:21] time when they had the welsh revival
[1:07:23] going on there's some dignitaries from
[1:07:24] the states
[1:07:26] some of these great doctors of divinity
[1:07:28] went over to wales to find out where
[1:07:30] and what all this was about so they had
[1:07:33] on their turnaround collars and
[1:07:35] their plug hats and this walking down
[1:07:38] the street and here come a little couple
[1:07:39] home
[1:07:40] willing his little billy club in his
[1:07:42] hand whistling down at the cross where
[1:07:44] my savior died
[1:07:45] down there for cleansing from sin i
[1:07:47] cried there to my heart was a blood
[1:07:49] applied glory to his name
[1:07:51] walking down the street so they said
[1:07:53] this seems to be a religious man we'll
[1:07:54] go ask him
[1:07:56] and he said mister said yes sir he said
[1:07:59] we are here from the united states
[1:08:01] we're a delegation we come over here to
[1:08:03] investigate the welsh revival so-called
[1:08:06] we are doctors of divinity and we are
[1:08:08] here to look it over
[1:08:10] he said we want to know where the
[1:08:12] revival is and where it's held he said
[1:08:13] sir
[1:08:14] you have arrived
[1:08:17] hallelujah i am the welch revival
[1:08:22] the welch revivals in me
[1:08:25] here's where it's at that's the way it
[1:08:27] is when you live with that fountain of
[1:08:29] living waters
[1:08:30] it's living all the time bubbling over
[1:08:33] and over and over and over there's no
[1:08:34] end to it
[1:08:36] i'll go see if some water if we had a
[1:08:38] rain here not long ago
[1:08:39] that's not it it's that fountain of
[1:08:42] living water
[1:08:44] as i said gives us water free don't have
[1:08:46] to put rags on it
[1:08:47] to find out some educational rags before
[1:08:49] you send him out to preach to see if he
[1:08:51] spells his words right speaks them right
[1:08:53] if he uses the nouns and pronouns and so
[1:08:55] forth and adjectives
[1:08:57] many of them don't even know what they
[1:08:58] are but he's living at the fountain just
[1:09:00] the same
[1:09:02] see they don't have to depend on the
[1:09:05] local range to fill it up for the local
[1:09:07] revivals
[1:09:08] for it don't have to do that for its
[1:09:10] power and its purity
[1:09:12] is within itself that's where the word
[1:09:16] is
[1:09:17] its own power when a man can receive it
[1:09:20] in his heart
[1:09:21] it's got its purity it's got its power
[1:09:24] it's right
[1:09:25] in the word itself springs forth to life
[1:09:30] israel would get away from it they'd get
[1:09:31] in trouble
[1:09:33] every time they got away from it they
[1:09:34] got in trouble the same as we do now
[1:09:37] when the revival gets away from that
[1:09:38] then it's no good it digs itself some
[1:09:41] wells and
[1:09:41] or some stagnated cisterns and there it
[1:09:44] goes
[1:09:45] but he always helped him the murmuring
[1:09:48] at the red sea
[1:09:51] then when they murmured yet and all that
[1:09:54] he had promised made him a promise
[1:09:56] he should have turned it back right
[1:09:58] there away we'd look at it but he had
[1:10:00] promised to take him over there
[1:10:02] what did he do then children of israel
[1:10:04] he furnished them the pillar of fire and
[1:10:06] everything for vindication their prophet
[1:10:08] and they let him out there to the sea
[1:10:10] and always his trouble against it
[1:10:12] and here come the pharaoh in his army
[1:10:15] and you know what god did
[1:10:16] he just opened up that red stagnated
[1:10:20] cistern the dead sees a deadest thing in
[1:10:23] the world
[1:10:25] it's really dead stagnated nothing can
[1:10:28] live in it
[1:10:29] and he opened it up and set them free
[1:10:32] on the other side he took them to where
[1:10:34] they wouldn't have to be bound by
[1:10:36] such a thing as that in the wilderness
[1:10:39] they found that the tanks
[1:10:41] could not be depended on they were dry
[1:10:44] found out they go from one water hole to
[1:10:47] another
[1:10:48] when they was in the water that said
[1:10:49] starving to death for a drink of water
[1:10:51] and they go to this tank over here upon
[1:10:55] is dried up they went to another place
[1:10:57] it was dried up
[1:10:58] they just couldn't think this was ever
[1:11:01] going to get a drink
[1:11:02] and then on the most unlikely place
[1:11:05] in all the desert they found the water
[1:11:09] it was in a rock
[1:11:13] it was in iraq the most unlikely place
[1:11:16] that a man would find any water would be
[1:11:18] in a dry
[1:11:18] rock in the middle of a desert but you
[1:11:21] see god
[1:11:22] does things like that and the most
[1:11:24] unlikely place in the most
[1:11:26] unusual way that's what we've always had
[1:11:29] they think you have to have a big
[1:11:31] denominations all together and let them
[1:11:32] all come together and have a great big
[1:11:34] milling around and so forth and get
[1:11:36] thousands to cooperate and all like this
[1:11:37] to have a revival
[1:11:39] sometime god takes the little old guy
[1:11:41] don't even know his abc's
[1:11:45] and right amongst a bunch of illiterate
[1:11:47] people that hardly knows her right hand
[1:11:48] from the left he can
[1:11:49] raise up a revival that'll shake the
[1:11:52] world
[1:11:54] he did to the time of john he done in
[1:11:56] the time of the prophets
[1:11:58] none of them as we know i was ever
[1:11:59] educated but
[1:12:01] god could get a hold of him and do
[1:12:03] something with him
[1:12:04] in this rock came forth the waters
[1:12:08] he was a rock and he commanded this rock
[1:12:10] and must be smoke
[1:12:12] and he gave abundance of pure fresh
[1:12:15] clean
[1:12:16] water to everybody that would drink
[1:12:19] he saved all who would drink from it a
[1:12:22] perfect parallel john 3 16 god so loved
[1:12:26] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:12:28] son
[1:12:28] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:12:30] perish but would have
[1:12:32] everlasting life god smoked that rock on
[1:12:35] calvary
[1:12:36] our judgment is upon him that from him
[1:12:38] might come the spirit of life
[1:12:41] that would give you and me eternal
[1:12:44] life that's a perfect parable of it
[1:12:46] there in this wilderness
[1:12:48] they never had to pull dig pump
[1:12:51] or anything just partake of his provided
[1:12:55] way
[1:12:55] freely when they didn't have to dig it
[1:12:58] out of a pond
[1:12:59] they didn't have to pull it up with a
[1:13:00] bucket they didn't have to have no
[1:13:02] window to get it with
[1:13:03] they just had to partake of it and
[1:13:05] that's all there is now you don't have
[1:13:07] to join nothing
[1:13:08] you don't have to get out the altar and
[1:13:09] work up something pumping it you don't
[1:13:11] have to
[1:13:12] say a word over and over and over until
[1:13:14] you get a confusion of language
[1:13:15] the only thing you have is just partake
[1:13:17] of him for you
[1:13:19] god's provided way no pumping no pushing
[1:13:23] no nothing
[1:13:24] just take of it freely nothing you have
[1:13:27] to do
[1:13:27] just partake of it that is just believe
[1:13:30] it that's all i can say
[1:13:32] to it they never had to do anything for
[1:13:34] it never had to dig for it
[1:13:35] they never had to get down and cry all
[1:13:37] night for it they just for talk of it
[1:13:39] it was smitten and ready that's right
[1:13:43] i'm looking at a man now sitting in the
[1:13:45] back of the room here
[1:13:47] i remember telling that on an old barn
[1:13:49] stall one day by a manger
[1:13:51] and he said but i'm no good i said i
[1:13:53] know you're not
[1:13:55] and i said i'm not either but i said
[1:13:57] you're looking at what you are
[1:13:58] quit looking at what you are look what
[1:14:00] he is he said if i could just get rid of
[1:14:02] these cigarettes brother brahm
[1:14:04] i i'd be a christian i said don't get
[1:14:06] rid of them you're trying to get good
[1:14:07] and then come to him
[1:14:08] he never come to save good man he come
[1:14:10] to save bad men and know they were bad
[1:14:14] he said well i said listen you don't
[1:14:16] want to go to hell do you he said no
[1:14:18] i said well you don't have to he died
[1:14:21] that you might not have to go
[1:14:22] he said what do i have to do i said
[1:14:24] nothing it says that simple
[1:14:27] he said but if i could ever i said there
[1:14:29] you go back to that cigarette again
[1:14:31] quit thinking about that cigarette just
[1:14:33] remember think about him
[1:14:35] what he did what he is not what you are
[1:14:38] you're no good and you never was never
[1:14:40] will be
[1:14:41] but what he is he's the one
[1:14:44] and i said now the only one thing you
[1:14:46] have to do if he tucked your place down
[1:14:47] you just willingly accept what he did
[1:14:49] the only thing you have to do is just
[1:14:50] accept it
[1:14:51] well i said that's simple i'll do that i
[1:14:53] said here's the creek
[1:14:56] i brought him up here and baptized him
[1:14:58] in the name of jesus christ
[1:15:02] some of these people are sitting here
[1:15:03] and i i know they felt funny at me for
[1:15:06] doing that
[1:15:06] but i know what i was doing i seen in
[1:15:09] the man something that was genuine
[1:15:11] i could see it there and i took him and
[1:15:12] baptized him in the name of the lord
[1:15:14] jesus
[1:15:15] and when we did that it wasn't long
[1:15:18] after that just went down to his son's
[1:15:20] house
[1:15:20] we've seen a vision of a tree being
[1:15:23] broke at a certain place
[1:15:25] and the man fell almost broke his back
[1:15:28] took him in the hospital
[1:15:29] that night the lord revealed to me that
[1:15:31] was the end of cigarettes
[1:15:33] so the next day he wanted some
[1:15:34] cigarettes i said i'll buy him a carton
[1:15:36] and take it to you
[1:15:37] you just watch and see his cigarette
[1:15:39] days are done
[1:15:40] he's never smoked one since never wanted
[1:15:42] one sansa
[1:15:45] god see the first thing you've got to do
[1:15:48] is to come
[1:15:49] to that fountain you've got to come to
[1:15:52] that water realize
[1:15:53] it's nothing that you can do it's what
[1:15:55] he done for
[1:15:56] you you don't have to dig you don't have
[1:15:59] to pump out you don't have to
[1:16:01] quit this you don't have to quit that
[1:16:03] the only thing you have to do is get
[1:16:04] there and drink
[1:16:05] that's all your thirsty drink
[1:16:09] now he was the wrong god smoting for us
[1:16:13] and he gave forth abundance of pure
[1:16:15] clean water
[1:16:16] he does yet today to everyone that will
[1:16:18] believe this
[1:16:20] is his grace of course to his people us
[1:16:24] they something like they're like the
[1:16:26] people of today
[1:16:28] ready to receive what they can get but
[1:16:31] don't want to give any service in return
[1:16:34] israel was ready to to drink from the
[1:16:37] rock now
[1:16:37] but they didn't want to give god his
[1:16:40] service that was doing
[1:16:42] and he's always given us a service you
[1:16:45] know we can't even breathe without him
[1:16:47] we can't breathe without god's service
[1:16:50] that's how dependent we are on him
[1:16:51] and yet it almost breaks us into if we
[1:16:54] try to
[1:16:55] have to do something for him he asks us
[1:16:56] to do something go
[1:16:58] see somebody go pray for somebody go
[1:17:00] help somebody it's almost
[1:17:02] breaks us up to do it but we don't want
[1:17:04] to do
[1:17:05] anything to him for service his
[1:17:07] complaint was
[1:17:08] they have forsaken me the word
[1:17:13] and have accepted a broken cistern
[1:17:16] instead
[1:17:18] except they have forsaken me the
[1:17:19] fountain of life
[1:17:21] the fountain of water of life and they
[1:17:25] desire and would rather drink from a
[1:17:28] stagnated sister
[1:17:30] could you imagine that
[1:17:36] you see the beauty of it
[1:17:39] you don't go get clean you drink the
[1:17:43] water
[1:17:44] and it makes you clean
[1:17:47] that that's that's what they left
[1:17:52] they left drinking the water
[1:17:55] as being the source of their power
[1:17:59] and they made something else
[1:18:02] in other words i'm going to go get rid
[1:18:04] of this i'm going to go get rid of that
[1:18:05] it's a cistern it's a cistern it'll
[1:18:08] never keep the frogs away
[1:18:11] it'll never keep the lizards away
[1:18:14] but did you see what he said he came
[1:18:17] for men that know that they're bad
[1:18:21] and what did he do he provided him a
[1:18:23] drink
[1:18:24] and that's why he said i know a bunch of
[1:18:26] people are looking funny at me
[1:18:28] because that man was still smoking
[1:18:33] but that man was thirsty and the only
[1:18:36] way that man
[1:18:38] could get rid of those cigarettes
[1:18:41] was to take a drink
[1:18:46] i don't care what's bothering you left
[1:18:48] the internet
[1:18:50] gossip style fashion
[1:18:54] unrighteousness no matter what it is
[1:18:57] that god
[1:18:58] provided away not your system
[1:19:02] not your way of getting over it not your
[1:19:05] way of overcoming
[1:19:07] not you making a rules and laws but
[1:19:10] simply take a drink
[1:19:16] it's there for anybody who will drink
[1:19:20] he's not he's no respecter of person
[1:19:24] it's there it's what he said
[1:19:27] it's there it's self-cleaning
[1:19:32] so if you put the water in it's what
[1:19:35] cleans
[1:19:36] he said that rags it'll push it off
[1:19:40] he says those bugs and stuff can't come
[1:19:42] there because it's always
[1:19:43] pushing it out it's always pushing them
[1:19:46] away
[1:19:48] see if it's stagnant it attracts
[1:19:52] if it's living and bubbling those things
[1:19:56] can't live there
[1:19:58] it's the power of god and god made it so
[1:20:02] simple
[1:20:04] drink there's a fountain drink
[1:20:08] he said come unto me all you that heavy
[1:20:10] laden i'll give you rest come on me i am
[1:20:13] the fountain of living water
[1:20:14] come and drink freely drink
[1:20:18] freely this morning that's what we've
[1:20:20] got to get back to
[1:20:22] if not we're going to take this message
[1:20:25] and we're going to dig this message
[1:20:28] a shovel and we're going to take our
[1:20:31] ideas
[1:20:32] and we're going to dig something that's
[1:20:34] ourselves our way of judging one another
[1:20:37] our way of looking at one another our
[1:20:40] way of putting the gospel together
[1:20:42] putting all the teachings together and
[1:20:44] the prophet of god said this whole
[1:20:46] system came out in this day it forms the
[1:20:49] mark of the beast the image of rome
[1:20:51] and god provides a living fountain i'm
[1:20:54] looking for that fountain of living
[1:20:56] water
[1:20:57] to come forth gushing forth in a bride
[1:21:01] amen from the bedrock of god's word
[1:21:04] of eternity that fountain is what's
[1:21:07] flowing out
[1:21:08] not a sister not a system but living
[1:21:11] water
[1:21:11] the power of god in god's people why
[1:21:14] because they're drinking if you don't
[1:21:17] drink
[1:21:18] what happens it's stagnant
[1:21:23] you just can't say oh i believe the
[1:21:26] message
[1:21:28] you've got to have the god because he
[1:21:30] said it keeps
[1:21:31] changing every day there's more
[1:21:34] revelation
[1:21:35] coming forth more life coming forth
[1:21:38] god wants to give each of us more power
[1:21:41] blessed is he that overcometh in this
[1:21:43] day
[1:21:44] more of him so if if you're if you're in
[1:21:47] my medicine today if you look at
[1:21:49] yourself and you say i
[1:21:51] i'm becoming a one person denomination
[1:21:56] i'm stagnant i've got all this stuff
[1:22:01] how do i get out of this condition
[1:22:04] how do i change this nature
[1:22:08] take a drink that water
[1:22:12] will change your nature you can't
[1:22:15] overcome without a drink
[1:22:19] this morning in fact
[1:22:22] you can't even continue on in this
[1:22:25] message
[1:22:26] intellectually
[1:22:30] you've got to have a drink you
[1:22:33] you understand if if it was the fountain
[1:22:38] that caused the prophet to say
[1:22:42] what he said what he
[1:22:45] said was bearing witness of the fountain
[1:22:53] and that's what he put on display was
[1:22:56] this fountain of living water
[1:22:58] we don't want to take this message and
[1:23:00] dig a cistern
[1:23:01] and put this message in it where it
[1:23:04] becomes stagnant
[1:23:06] no we want the fountain that brought the
[1:23:08] message
[1:23:09] because the message was this fountain
[1:23:12] can live in you
[1:23:14] also do you want to drink from that this
[1:23:17] morning
[1:23:18] amen if you've got away from that
[1:23:20] fountain won't you come back to it
[1:23:23] won't you ask him won't you get back in
[1:23:26] a closet somewhat
[1:23:27] and and don't go thinking in your mind
[1:23:30] just say lord
[1:23:31] just give me a drink but just
[1:23:34] just a drink
[1:23:37] do you remember what the rich man was
[1:23:41] he sat in there and he said oh just
[1:23:45] send lazarus to just dip his
[1:23:48] finger in water and
[1:23:52] lay it on my tongue
[1:23:56] that's because he didn't drink well the
[1:23:59] fountain was there
[1:24:02] it may not say this humbly and it
[1:24:05] applies to me too
[1:24:07] we will not be able to finish this
[1:24:10] journey
[1:24:12] without fresh water
[1:24:17] we will perish in this spiritual
[1:24:20] wilderness
[1:24:26] not a revival but
[1:24:29] unplugging the brook of living water
[1:24:35] and the life that's in that seed
[1:24:38] and letting it flow freely
[1:24:41] if we're going to be successful we're
[1:24:44] only going to be spiritually successful
[1:24:47] if the living fountain is flowing in us
[1:24:51] lord let me drink
[1:24:54] let me drink we've got three young men
[1:24:58] this morning
[1:25:00] another femme brother marco
[1:25:03] and brother lambert i hope they're here
[1:25:06] this morning
[1:25:07] i call them lamborghini
[1:25:10] and i believe that they want to
[1:25:14] take the first step in the drinking
[1:25:18] from this fountain i hope i don't
[1:25:21] embarrass brother lamb
[1:25:22] but i am blessed to remember i said
[1:25:24] remember why do you want to get baptized
[1:25:27] he says i know if i don't get baptized
[1:25:30] i'm only going to get worse
[1:25:33] i thought praise god
[1:25:38] it remind me of little benjamin i said
[1:25:40] little benjamin i'm not going to bother
[1:25:42] baptize you he says well then i'll go
[1:25:43] someplace else to get baptized
[1:25:48] amen don't you want that water this
[1:25:51] morning
[1:25:51] don't you want that fountain it's our
[1:25:54] success
[1:25:56] it's the only way we're going to make it
[1:25:58] you i i've worked so hard to overcome
[1:26:01] certain things
[1:26:03] i work every day i work so hard i don't
[1:26:06] want to be the way that i
[1:26:07] am and what do i look at myself i just
[1:26:11] keep building systems and man-made
[1:26:13] things and
[1:26:15] and i got so tired of it i said lord
[1:26:18] give me a drink
[1:26:20] i just want to go back to where it was
[1:26:23] when i took my first drink
[1:26:25] when that water was so cool and it just
[1:26:28] come down my throat and it
[1:26:30] it just seemed to push all the sin off
[1:26:33] of me and
[1:26:34] all the weight off of me and then i've
[1:26:37] tried to
[1:26:39] serve them and and i want to give my
[1:26:43] service
[1:26:43] for that drink but what happens if your
[1:26:46] service
[1:26:47] takes you away from the fountain and
[1:26:49] pretty soon you're doing god a service
[1:26:51] without it being his will
[1:26:53] what do you got to do you got to stop
[1:26:57] you got to lay everything down
[1:27:00] and say i'll perish without a drink
[1:27:05] lord give me a drink
[1:27:08] i think brother samuel is going to help
[1:27:11] me baptize this morning so
[1:27:13] if the young men that would come this
[1:27:16] morning
[1:27:18] to be baptized if you'd come here and
[1:27:20] i'm going to go prepare
[1:27:23] for baptism because i just believe
[1:27:26] that those streams of warm water are
[1:27:30] moving across the baptistry this morning
[1:27:35] don't you that it really do something
[1:27:39] for these young men so god bless you if
[1:27:41] you're here if you'd come
[1:27:43] and i don't know if they all were able
[1:27:45] to make it because
[1:27:46] some of them relying on their parents
[1:27:48] and and situations arrive but
[1:27:52] when a young person wants to be baptized
[1:27:55] i always make sure that they
[1:27:58] they talk to their parents
[1:28:02] first and i i i don't want to
[1:28:05] baptize them unless their parents feel
[1:28:08] they're ready
[1:28:09] and sometimes their parents aren't ready
[1:28:14] so they might not let them get baptized
[1:28:18] but if god's god's child god will get
[1:28:21] their parents ready too
[1:28:24] so you you understand it's a delicate
[1:28:26] situation but
[1:28:27] but all these young people talk to their
[1:28:30] parents and
[1:28:32] their parents feel that they're ready
[1:28:34] brother ram said when do you baptize
[1:28:36] somebody when they're ready
[1:28:37] when they want to do it right then even
[1:28:40] for children
[1:28:41] you never stop them from doing the right
[1:28:43] thing and these
[1:28:45] young men that are being baptized today
[1:28:48] they're
[1:28:48] well into the age of accountability
[1:28:51] so amen is that going to be our hearts
[1:28:53] desire to take a drink if you're
[1:28:56] discouraged with yourself
[1:28:58] and you look at yourself take the advice
[1:29:00] of the prophet
[1:29:01] quit looking at yourself look at him
[1:29:05] he's holding a cup out to you take a
[1:29:08] drink
[1:29:09] and live look and live drink and live
[1:29:12] this morning
[1:29:13] god bless you brother
