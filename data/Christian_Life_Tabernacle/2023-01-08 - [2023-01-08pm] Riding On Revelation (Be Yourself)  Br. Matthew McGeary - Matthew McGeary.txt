to love you and to serve you with all of our heart and put you first and give you the first place and Lord we're privileged to be here to be gathered together with brothers and sisters who have recognized your voice in this last stage calling a people out of the darkness and into your Marvelous Light Lord what a fellowship we have what a family so now Lord we've gathered once again under the banner of love in your name the Lord Jesus Christ knowing that you're here amongst us we're asking Lord that you'd come and break the bread of life Lord that you'd minister to the needs that are represented Lord increase the faith bring Deliverance for those that need Deliverance healing to those that have infirmities in the body spiritual Deliverance Lord whatever that would be we know that by the preaching of the word you can accomplish all these things Lord so we look to you now just to have your perfect will and way in this service in your precious name the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen you have your bibles if you turn the Revelations chapter 6. we just want to bring you greetings from the Saints in Romania from Brother Gabriel and the churches that we visited there and also um bring you greetings from Brother Wendell Martin and the Saints and Pawnee Oklahoma I must say it's good to be back in fellowship with my brothers and sisters here we were gone for an extended time we feel and our hearts were with you and we we just appreciate your prayers uh your support and and if it wasn't for you we wouldn't be able to go but I want you all to know my heart is here with you there's no other place I'd rather be but right here uh putting my shoulder to the wheel with the with the Saints uh here in our home church so uh just continue to remember our pastor pray strength for him and just looking uh knowing that God will will rot a mighty work and I'm looking forward to the Revelation and the continuing leading from our Shepherd amen Revelations chapter 6 we're just going to try to jump in um right into the middle of a thought if you will and just by God's help we'll we'll move through this but Revelations chapter 6 verse 7 and 8 would read like this and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I look and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth and you if you'll also turn over to Revelations 10 we'll read verse 7 I I just in reading this I if you notice as uh uh John here is caught up um and the seals are are being spoken to him there's four beasts and they're saying uh come and see and he and he would say and I I and I heard and I heard and the Beast saying and I like how on the fourth Beast it's it's the one Beast that eagle Beast he actually says I I like how it's worded there um how he says and I Heard a Voice and just in Reading Revelations 10 verse 7 it says but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished if he had declared to his servants the prophets amen you may be seated we pray a blessing on the reading of the word now just jumping right into this a thought here we're going to read a portion out of the fifth seal so just bear with us if you can try to pull some of the things that you're familiar with and if some of the things seem broken up uh go go listen to the fifth seal and um just continue to study and by God's grace some of these things can be a benefit to you the prophet of God would say this in the fifth seal you'd say uh the the four stages of his writer has been revealed the four stages of the Antichrist writing and has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have uh they don't have to have anymore and there was four living creatures of God to announce the writers that rode for Beast our four powers now we know that a beast by interpretation of the terms of the Bible symbol means power now let's get that close the four Beast in the Bible represents a power among the people so he's pointing out there's four beasts that were riding even uh you had the White Horse the red horse the black horse The Pale Horse he's saying a beast represents power than the prophet of God would go on to start talking about Daniel and saying Daniel in the dreams and the Visions he would he would see uh maybe a a a a bear that with a rib and then he'd see a goat he'd see a lion with teeth and and he would see all of these things and the prophet would take the time to show how when he would see these beasts it would be representing a power it'd be Nations and Powers rising up and and one of them being the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar so he's showing here that the symbol in the uh uh Book of Revelation here is represented in power and he's showing how it represents a National Power or a nation he's also showing that it represents the power of the devil and he comes on down into paragraph 98 and he's says it also represents holy power a beast did you know that notice Rebecca when the servant Abraham Eliza when he came to get Rebecca he mounted her upon a camel the very camel she watered as she rode this camel to meet her unseen bridegroom the very thing she watered was the thing that took her to her future home and her husband and it's the same thing today I like that now the prophet of God has shown you and typed there in the Old Testament just as there was a power to carry Rebecca to her bridegroom he's showing it's the same thing today the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it is the very word that becomes alive and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom well I just want to buy the grace of God speak to you a little bit tonight on writing on Revelation we're riding on Revelation I tell you we're riding on the revelation of the Seven Seals we're riding on the revelation of the revealed word in this hour we're being carried by Revelation and I don't know if we might get to this uh if we'll have the time to but as a subject I I just want to say Be Yourself be what God Made You Be Yourself but just in this thought of writing on Revelation will continue a reading here in the fifth seal he doesn't notice as the Antichrist went for on his Beast of ministry there God sent forth a beast to combat it amen who were students of the word we've studied it we've listened to the church ages we've listened to the seal we know that that Antichrist Spirit went out warring and against the church and now he's saying and God sent forth a beast to combat it see now watch then every time the Beast wrote on his horse the Antichrist rode on his horse on his Beast to announce his ministry God sent his Beast also and he was on that to announce his combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against him and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist God sent a certain type of power to meet him amen he said a certain type of power to meet him so every time you see this Antichrist Spirit uh writing it's being represented and obese it's being represented in a horse rider and now there's a power or or another Beast that God sends to combat it and as we know it's those four beasts the four beasts that guarded the gospel it well it was The Lion and the ox and the man and the eagle and he goes on to say this in paragraph 91 uh 191 and we might be moving a little fast so we'll try to slow down we'll get there so just reading in paragraph 191 it says then he raised up another Power he sent a power to meet it then he raised up another Power he sent another power to meet it and then at the last power he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original Faith again of their fathers the eagle age then you notice there is no more beast that's all of it that's the end now if you would take now Revelations 10 1 7 I've been referring to it remember in the last message age see what's to happen all the mysteries of God would be revealed the eagle amen so notice he says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and just my what just was on my heart is how uh the prophet of God was was showing that in type with Rebecca how she was writing a power to meet her bridegroom and God has sent a power in this age not only to combat the Antichrist Spirit not only to war against it not only to make you and over Overcomer not only to give you a power to withstand The Wiles of the devil but God has sent her power God has sent a revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ and it is that revelation of the age it is that Revelation and that power that has come and captivated a bride it is apprehended you in that very Revelation that very power that has been poured out upon the Bride of Jesus Christ has now taken you and it's taken you somewhere look he didn't come to leave you here there is a power that has come there is a revelation that has come to the Bride of Jesus Christ not only to make you Victorious not only to make you a conqueror not only to make you be able to withstand The Wiles of the devil but this power is transforming you this power is changing you and this power is taking you from one dimension to another dimensional don't you know church that there is a power here to change your body there's a power here to take you into the Rapture there is a power here to take you oh it's an unseen power it's an unseen Force but just as Rebecca was riding upon that Camel it was packing her to a place that she would see her bridegroom and we arrived in a revelation we are riding in a power right into the presence of our bridegroom oh Hallelujah we'll see him one of these days we know he's here we know he's with us he knows he's in us but one of his great and wonderful days we're gonna see him oh in a meeting of the air just to look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace oh I can't wait church just any day it could be tomorrow it could be next week it could be tonight but I tell you it gots to be a power that has taken over your life to bring you into that place notice the Beast represents a holy power First Peter 1 verse 3 says blessed be the god and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercies hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you you got reservations do you know that you got reservations you know you ever been invited to a wedding and it says RSVP if you want a seat at the table you want to write back and say I'm coming I want to let you I know I'm coming well did you know that that God has made a reservation for you you know he already made the reservation for you before you even knew you were going he actually wrote your name and read Hallelujah he took his own blood and he wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and said I'm making a river a reservation for my bride now do you think he would make a reservation for you and then say hey I got a seat at the table for you I I made it all ready for you oh we're going to spend eternity together now and now let me give you a a riddle let me give you uh some circumstances and if you could just make your way through life if you can just take my word and you can figure it all out and you can piece it together and just by chance if you could overcome the wicked one well then on that day I'll say well well done my good and faithful servant no no God God is reserved a place for you and with that reservation he he has made a way for you he has made a promise he has given a power he has given a promise and he is going to be the one to make sure you don't miss it no one else can take your place there's not going to be an extra there's not going to be an extra chair up there you're not going to have to tell people to scoot over and make room and all of a sudden like man Hey Brother Matt made it let's scoot over like well we could get a chair I mean we'll speak one speak one chair be there hey brother Matt there's a no there's going to be a place I don't care uh uh uh from us from the leash to the greatest from the greatest to Elise look there's a table there's a chair that's been set for you and you can't miss it God has reservations aren't you thankful for that now watch what he says here in verse 5 . he says who are kept who are kept by the power of God oh thank you Jesus oh you have an inheritance Incorruptible it's undefiled if theta's not away it's reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last times see you're kept by the power of God the promises of God are kept by a power there's a power keeping you it's not off somewhere down the road somewhere and and you all of a sudden got to start thinking uh where did God go uh where is God at I wonder I need I need to I need to phone them up on the phone like calling 9-1-1 God are you in the area I need help no he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble he's right here he's right now he's on time there's a power that's keeping you oh how many of us could go back in our lives and start to walk through our lives and look back and say there he was there he was that that wasn't that wasn't you outsmarting the cops that wasn't you outsmart in the judicial system that wasn't you being oh I'm a good driver and I got out of the way and look at me I'm somebody I was the grace of God it was the power of God something was looking out of your life because you are predestinated seed of God that had to meet the challenge for the age that God had written your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and there's been a power keeping you don't you realize that that power what wasn't looking out over you just when you were born that power was looking over your mama and your daddy and your grandpa your great grandpa all the way down God has been looking on over that natural seed he knew exactly who you would be he knew exactly what you would look like he knew exactly the troubles he knew exactly the Temptation he knew exactly the complexes and the depressions and the battles and the self-esteem and all the things that you would face he knew how bad it would get he would knew when you'd be laying there on your back and you'd be crying out for him there was a power Hallelujah there is a power keeping the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't know about you but I get excited about it because it was left to my own ability I would be dead if it was left of my wants and my abuse I'd be in a jail cell somewhere oh but thanks be to God there's been a power that's I've been looking all over my life the power of God oh I feel a little beside myself I've been kept by a power and when you catch that Revelation and you realize you're riding on the revelation of something that God is doing in you then let it come Let The Trials come look if he took care of you when you were out there come on dad if he took care of you when you were out there living in sin when he took care about you out there when you were in drugs and alcohol if he took care of you out there when you ain't even trying to serve him what about now Church what about now that you've surrendered your life you've planned the blood of Jesus Christ and you've come to the Revelation that there's a power that is keeping me time to tell all that Old Devil to shut up and to back up I'm tired of you trying to rob me I'm a Son of God I'm heir to all things I'm heir to my joy I'm here to my peace I'm heir to everything that God has given me and I'm here to take it back we were having some fellowship on it I can't remember the sermon quite right now but brother random starts preaching to somebody he says look you who don't have the Holy Ghost and you don't even know anything about it now I better watch out we start running inspiration I'm on a short a short clock tonight brother Brandon starts speaking to somebody now we always got to think we ought to be all buttoned up I'm ready to receive the word now brother Branham looks out he says now you I'm talking to somebody now you who don't even have the Holy Ghost and you don't know nothing about it that he's talking to somebody maybe you've been around it a little bit a while maybe you've seen some people run and you've seen them shout and you've seen them amen but you can sit right there you can go to the camp meeting you can even get get a little inspired and you can run and you can shout but you know what you can still sit right there and all of that and not know anything about the Holy Ghost and it's time that we look inward in itself and start to ask ourselves the question do we even know anything that we're talking about do I need don't know anything about the Holy Ghost can I produce anything that's in the book of Acts can I point to anything oh God where are you at in my life I realize God I need you I need that power to become a reality I realize that I'm lacking I don't have that power to overcome out there because when I go out there with my friends when I get on the internet every time I see myself doing things that a Son of God that was filled with the Holy Ghost would never do and now I realize oh God I don't know anything about the Holy Ghost well that doesn't make you a Son of God or not a son of God if you were a sign on you always were a son and if you're a Son of God you don't have to have the Holy Ghost that doesn't make you a son what are you talking about brother Matthew this sounds kind of fanatical well I'm so glad I'm standing upon the words of a Vindicated prophet who looks out and says you who don't have the Holy Ghost you don't know nothing about it but something inside of you who wants it that's eternal life and you are heir Hallelujah listen to The Prophet's word if there is something in your heart that wants it he said that is eternal life and in your condition no Holy Ghost don't know nothing about it but in your condition if there's something inside you that wants it he said that is eternal life and you are Heir then if you're Heir that means you're a son that means you're a daughter and now listen to what he tells the believer to do you look at that old devil in the face and you say you Robert how can I do that brother random I don't have the Holy Ghost I don't have I I don't know nothing about it it's not your power you ain't keeping yourself but there's a God Of Heaven who's looking down at you say just check me out my word oh heaven will back you up just look at that old devil say devil you're the robber you've made me do this and you made me do that I'm a Son of God I renounce you Old Devil you've taken my health I'm taking it back in the name of God and you watch he said something's bound to happen watch the Holy Ghost pour out upon you oh Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever and while Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that were listening to it he's the same God he's the same yesterday today and forever there is a power that's in the house of God tonight to convert your soul kept by a power we know there's only two powers you have the power of God or the power of Satan we see the powers of Satan it's all around us I don't recommend it but just read the news there you go same news different people corrupt politics corrupt policy insanity and Mankind domestic Insanity uh that there's just becoming more and more murders more and more insanity just as Paul would say for we wrestle not in Ephesians 6 12 he would say for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers and against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places two powers so if it ain't the power of God then what power is it it's time we grow up young people it's time we mature it's time we quit playing around and think we can keep the same old friends from high school and the same old friends from our school and we can go over their house and we can rub shoulders and and we can kind of be like them and and we can kind of have fun like them no you can't no you can't God didn't God when he called Abraham and called him out and separated a people unto himself that's not just some neat little story come on there's something about it when I when I when I when I see I believe they call him an orthodox Jew when I see one of the Jews that that are still believing the same law and they're walking around and they got the curls and they got their hat and they got the clothes I don't know about you but I it means something to me I feel like they're my brother when I when I see them holding to something because why it it it speaks in my heart to a people that's been called out and they've been separated we're different we dress different we talk different we hang out with different people we're different and if we're blending in it's time the blending stops that's a Nickelodeon spirit blending and mixing and talking to boys and girls that don't believe them that's nonsense we need the Holy Ghost we need the power that has been given to the age to take over our life and to keep us to bring us into what he has spoken of you that's what we want to have a little Fellowship on we're talking about writing the Revelation we're writing on the Revelation the word that is common has been opened up to the believer it's the very power that has taken uh taken taken you hostage if you can if you as you surrender to that word you say oh God I know in myself I cannot do it but if I just subject myself to your word if I just subject myself to your righteousness if I just give up my ideas in the way that I think things should go and I just surrender to this word this word will pack you into the fullness of the revelation why because it's a power we wrestle not with flesh and blood only but principalities and darkness I love the message Shalom that that brother Brandon would preach I I believe is 64. he preaches that I think January 12th and also the 16th I believe in 64. and he he takes Isaiah 60. and he starts to use you know arise and shine thy light has come but in verse 2 he says in in Gross darkness is upon the people grow gross darkness is upon the people there's there's a darkness that is pressing into the people there is a power that is pressing into the people come on that's what we're seeing I I I I just I I every once in a while I look at the news and you notice that the offenses and the crimes that are committed not only are they becoming more of them but the age keeps getting lower and lower and and I was I was amazed uh I think it was last month I was I went and looked at the news and there was an eight-year-old boy who it would shot his mom because she didn't buy him a video game and I thought oh God an eight-year-old how can an eight-year-old come to to a place to wear a a demonic uh spirit can so press himself into him and I thought that was you know I didn't think we could get any lower I I didn't think it could get any worse and then you you look at the news and find out a six-year-old brought a gun to school and shot their teacher a six-year-old that's in the negative what what is it there's a power look friends what's making them do it what's making them act that way what's making them do those things it's a power that is pressing into them and taking control of their lives six years old well that's in the negative and all of a sudden I start to think well if the devil can do that is there any six-year-olds in here raise your hand any six-year-olds seven-year-old oh they're I'm preaching to y'all back there hey you six and seven year olds back there in Sunday school I want to tell you you can be filled with the Holy Ghost you can turn this world upside down it's six-year-olds and seven-year-olds are packing guns to school then why not our six and seven year olds packing Bibles oh mama I got kicked out of school again for what I propped my sword praise the Living God go ahead and convert somebody young people if the devil can take control of six-year-olds and seven-year-olds and their girls then my God has such a power to combat that and take our six-year-olds take our seven years and fill them with the Holy Ghost maybe I've lost my mind but I believe it I believe it I'm looking for it I got an expectation I don't know maybe a five-year-old starts speaking in tongues in our church maybe a six-year-old will prophesy is anything too hard for God where are you at church there they are I'm looking for these young ones right here get a good look at these young kids walking in I'm believing for them to be filled with the power of God I'm looking for it Saints we gotta go in a rapture we always wonder how is that going to happen we keep having babies we be keep having kids well I'm just starting to think I got a god matter of fact it comes to me now Hallelujah if John could be filled with the Holy Ghost in his mama's womb then I believe the pride of Jesus Christ go on and keep planting your potatoes keep having children and when that sweet comes maybe that baby had been laying in their dead you haven't felt it in three or four months and I'll say whoa what is that what is it it's the coming of the Lord the Holy Ghost is not only swept into your womb but it's swept into your whole family it's going to bring up Pride into a body change into a Rapture there is a power that has been poured out upon the Bride of Jesus Christ oh I'm looking for at church call me crazy call me insane but I'm looking for my young ones four years old five years old where are you at I'm looking for the power of God to take control of your life yeah well what about us parents then I need the power of God taking control of my own life not just on Sunday not just on Wednesday every moment of every day let me surrender myself to that power because it's here Mark 13 20 would say and accept that the Lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect's sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days this another layer of this opened up I always read that and I realized oh no flesh no flesh could be saved don't you see what Satan's coming for he's coming for the children 12 year old wasn't young enough 11 wasn't young enough 10 wasn't young enough nine eight seven six sounds like a countdown yeah we're in a countdown no flesh is going to be saved there is one place of safety that is the power that has been released to the Bride of Jesus Christ in the evening time under the revelation praise the Lord there's a revelation that's been released something to take you and to pack you to keep you and outside of that outside of that I I don't know any other place of safety I don't know how God will do it I I mean I know there's I know there's foolish virgin and I know there's going to be a white Throne judgment and and I know I don't understand it because some will be able who never had eternal life will be able to enter in you understand me only the bride only those that were a part of him always were you've always had eternal life because you're a son or daughter of him so so you you've always had it but God in his Sovereign Grace and his Mercy yes on that day somebody who was maybe good to the bride or they walked into light that they had and on that day God will see fit to to Pardon them but I tell you I I I don't know I can't see how anybody if you understand where I'm going with this well I'll just speak on myself there's no way I could make it on that on white throne no way no I'm sorry no and no man no man or woman can make it on their works impossible so they went a message when the Capstone calls comes crying Grace Grace and he's bringing a love letter to the church it's like not pardoned you this is my pardon this is the fullness of redemption this is the plan I've had in my mind all down Through the Ages he that huffing ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church this is what I've been doing all Along come out of her my people be not a partaker of her plagues you got to come out and come into the message this is the only place of safety and it's in the message where there's a power to take you into not leave you here for a tribulation ain't no guarantees there is what we're talking about we're gonna somehow find a way to close but it's getting so evil remember remember Sodom I can't remember what to start off with Abraham's like well you know please don't destroy him if so many could be saved no I ain't that many righteous there well a hundred no 50 no 10. nope you see that's the condition we're living in no flesh will be saved the prophet of God says this and the voice of the sign God will build his church upon the foundation of Jesus Christ and that's the Bible outside of that all other grounds are sinking Sands God doesn't change his nature doesn't change he made women different from men and men different from women he dressed them different and wants them to stay that way see when women wants to look like men and men wants to look like women oh my such a perversion and the whole thing looked like it's got a grip on the people and you can't change it looks like a great monster a great Blackness if you understand what I'm speaking of in the spirit a monster has got them grabbed and they can't get away from it too much Hollywood too much television too much other nonsense everything we got is polluted no wonder if the work isn't cut short for the elect's sake there will be no flesh saved a monster has grabbed them now you start to understand the things you're reading in the news and and why six-year-olds and seven-year-olds can do the things that they're doing because they've indicated Prophet I stood on the earth and said a monster has actually grabbed them there's too much Hollywood too much TV too much nonsense oh look look it's the invasion of America what has happened Satan has taken over the minds and the lives of people and they have been given over to a reprobate mind they have been totally uh uh uh possessed by spirits a monsters grab them now if anything that should be sobering to every single one of us to know when we go out into the world when we go out into the workplace when we go to the restaurants wherever you go know that people have been abducted by a monster and he's making them dressed that way act that way say the things that they're doing it's spiritual wickedness in high places that has totally grabbed their lives and is making them do the things that they're doing we say brother Matthew that's just the evil people well John 6 28 said then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent what is the church world done they've rejected the messenger they've rejected the word they have rejected Revelations 10 7. they first uh let's read Titus 1 16 quickly foreign they profess that they know God but in Works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate David would say this in Psalms 106 39 he say thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions second Timothy 3 5 moving quickly towards a close having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now I've just taken some time to labor upon that because we want to come back to what we were we were ministering in the beginning we see that power we see the power of wickedness we see the power of Darkness but there is another Power John 1 12. but as many as received him glory to God God has a provided way how can we work the works of God believe on him who is sent and as many as received him as many as received Christ the word to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name I want to say there is a power to make you what you are you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you didn't become a son or a daughter of God by the new birth right you always were a son or daughter of God therefore you could be reborn so there has to be a power to come upon your life to transform you into what God has spoken of you amen look at Samson Samson was just a little scrawny boy but he was chosen to be a deliverer he was chosen to be a judge right God had given him a purpose God had given him a calling but but Samson didn't have strength Samson didn't have ability but what he had is that he was elected he was born to manifest the word of God as a judge for Israel that when they would get themselves in trouble and the enemy would come against him that God would send a power upon Samson and then when that power Came Upon Samson then you really saw what Samson was then he could really perform the work of the Lord because there was a power to make him what he was you look at the Hebrew children look they they said hey we're not going to bend we're not going to bow but we serve a god that's able to deliver us we serve a God that has the power see the Hebrew children had a revelation my God's A Healer he's going to heal me and even if he don't I will I will spend every waking moment professing my God Is A Healer O King even if you throw me into the fiery furnace am I God doesn't deliver me he's a deliverer he's a god of power he's a god of love he's a god of compassion he's a long suffering he's a god of forgiveness he is a god of kindness why because it's a revelation I'm not basing life experiences upon who God is I'm basing it upon the revelation of what he has revealed to me in my soul in Heaven and Earth will pass away but this word this Revelation that I'm riding on will never pass away and that power showed up and did the job there was a fourth man in the fire there was another Power that where even the fire couldn't touch him don't you realize that you have access don't you realize that that same power is over your life that same power is here to make you an overcomer that same power is here to deliver you you don't have to keep contending with those same habits you don't have to continue going through all of those things I don't want to keep you too long but the power of God there's a power of God to make you something in your heart believes it if something in you amen is the word there's a power of God that's keeping you to bring you into the manifestation of it the God God sent Moses down to the children of Israel brought him out of Egypt two million of them right 2 million strong come out into the Wilderness look they all were delivered out of Egypt they all crossed the Red Sea they all saw the pillar of Fire by night in the cloud by day they all they all drank from the water the bitter water that was turned they all drank from The Rock they all ate Manna in the wilderness but how many crossed over into the Promised Land there was only two because out of the 2 million two of them were riding on a revelation see when the children at Cadence barnia when they had crossed over into the promised land ten spies came by back and testified what man could do oh 10 spies came back and said we can't do it see they were looking at what man could do because they didn't have the revelation they weren't elected but there was two that come back they weren't looking at what man could do they were looking at what God could do through man they were looking at abilities they were looking at the promise and saying oh the same God that brought us out of Egypt the same God that brought us into the Wilderness the same God that fed ourselves he's the same God the same power that will deliver us out of the hands of the enemy I like how Paul says in Galatians 2 he says I went up by Revelation Galatians 2 verse 2. would just be about 10 more minutes we'll move straight into communion he says and I went up by Revelation and communicated unto them that the gospel which I preached among the Gentiles but privately to them which were a reputation unless by any means I should run and had to run in vain I just something spoke to my heart there how it says that Paul went up by revelation see when something is revealed to you it's something that you know he says I went up by Revelation Paul wasn't pre-adventuring Paul wasn't wondering Paul wasn't uh uh uh uh uh thinking well this might work out Paul wasn't going up by man's idea he wasn't going up there and I hope it'll work out he wasn't going up by some emotion or some agenda or some point of view or some conclusion but Paul was going up by a revelation and it's the Revelation that carries you see just just as Paul right Paul was there on the boat and the angel of the Lord was with him and said hey Paul look you must go appear before Caesar now Paul had that revelation you must go up here before Caesar and you're not going to lose any lives on this boat now that it was a revelation to Paul so Paul could stand there and declare to the men on that boat say hey the angel of the Lord appeared to me last night and he said that look there's not going to be any loss of life but I must appear before Caesar so what does that mean no matter what Paul went through there wasn't no shipwreck there wasn't no snake biting there wasn't no government that could stop Paul from going to where God said he was going and I want to say the same thing for the Bride of Jesus Christ there ain't no shipwreck there ain't no car wreck there ain't no mistakes there ain't no unpaid bills there ain't no lost job there ain't no breakup there ain't no family situation there ain't no health issues there is nothing that is going to stop you from going into the presence of God because there's a power that is over your life that is going to pack you into the word that he spoke over your life what shall separate us from the love of God what is it the love of God the Capstone that's the enforcer it's the love of God over your life that's producing the message of the hour nothing can stop you Church and when it's revealed to you just to read a quick the prophet of God just a short snippet he says and then he says when you see it it's revealed to you and you know where you're going then nothing is going to stop you Glory so then when he says you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're sinless you're virtuous come on I know I say it a lot because I believe it it's it's it's it's been revealed we've received a revelation of Who We Are because Christ has revealed who he is and the revealing of the bridegroom it's a revealing of who we are because we're part of him then all of the things that he spoke in concerning you he has released a power over your life to bring you into the Fulfillment of that praise the Lord amen we'll just ask the brothers to come and start getting ready that's going to force my hand it's revealed to you and you know where you're going then nothing is going to stop you Abraham where are you going I don't know but I'm going on a promise he said it I believe it that settles it and Romans 4 19 says and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform you believe that let's just stand be therefore perfect there's a power producing perfection in you there is something carrying you the Capstone himself has come to the brine the revelation of who he is the love of God is called why don't you come why don't you heed the call why don't you be a part of this amen let's just turn in our Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 11. we'll read verse 23-34 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed to bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he hits up saying this is the cup in the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as oft as you eat the spread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come Lord Jesus we just take this bread that represents your body that was broken for us and you said Lord let us examine ourselves Lord we don't want to take it unworthily but we know that there's been a price paid that if we would identify with the sacrifice and we confess our sins knowing that you're just and faithful to forgive us Lord then then we can take eat of this bread we can remember your death your Resurrection your body that was broken for us Lord we take this wine father represents your blood that was shed for us Lord without that blood there would be no way for us to be able to come before you but it's that blood that we identify in the life that's in the blood Lord and how this represents that great sacrifice that you laid down your life for us that we could be forgiven so father we've taken the bread we take this cup Lord we pray your blessings upon and upon the people father as we tarry one for another may we examine ourselves Lord It's Too Late of an hour to be playing Church Lord if there's things we need to make right let's make them right this is a church that has been given the greatest privilege that anyone has ever known to live under the revealed word of the hour where any day we can be caught away to meet you in the air so Lord we do this with all of our heart now we ask the blessings upon the Bread and Wine in Jesus Christ's name we pray
