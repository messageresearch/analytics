[49:13] pull upon the word and let the lord have
[49:15] his perfect way
[49:17] and then we'll start at verse six and
[49:20] we're going to read
[49:21] to the end of the chapter here
[49:24] it says how be it we speak wisdom among
[49:28] them that are perfect yet not the wisdom
[49:30] of this world nor the princes of this
[49:32] world that come to naught
[49:34] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[49:35] mystery even the hidden wisdom which god
[49:38] ordained before the world unto our glory
[49:41] which none of the princes of the this
[49:42] world knew for had they known it
[49:45] they would not have crucified the lord
[49:46] of glory but as
[49:48] it is written eye hath not seen nor ear
[49:51] heard
[49:51] neither have entered into the heart of
[49:53] man the things which god prepared for
[49:55] them that love him
[49:56] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[49:58] his spirit
[50:00] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[50:02] the deep things of god
[50:04] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[50:06] save the spirit of man
[50:08] which is in him even so the things of
[50:10] god knoweth no man
[50:12] but the spirit of god now we have
[50:14] received
[50:15] not the spirit of the world but the
[50:17] spirit which is of god
[50:18] that we might know the things that are
[50:20] freely given to us of god
[50:23] which things also we speak not in the
[50:25] words of man's wisdom teacheth
[50:27] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[50:30] conspiracy comparing spiritual things
[50:32] with spiritual
[50:34] not the but the natural man receiveth
[50:36] not the things of the spirit of god
[50:38] for they are foolishness unto him
[50:41] neither can he know them
[50:42] because they are spiritually discerned
[50:45] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[50:47] things
[50:47] yet he himself is judged of no man for
[50:50] who hath known
[50:51] the mind of the lord that he may
[50:53] instruct him
[50:54] but we have the mind of christ amen and
[50:58] let's just turn over one
[50:59] one more scripture here ephesians
[51:02] chapter 3.
[51:24] i'll read verses 8 through 11.
[51:32] unto me whom less than the least of all
[51:34] saints is this grace given
[51:36] that i should preach among the gentiles
[51:38] the unsearchable riches of christ
[51:40] and to make all men see what is the
[51:42] fellowship of the mystery
[51:44] which from before from the beginning of
[51:46] the world hath been hid in god
[51:48] who created all things by jesus christ
[51:51] to the intent that now
[51:53] under the principalities and powers in
[51:54] heavenly places might be known by the
[51:57] church the manifold wisdom of god
[51:59] according to the eternal purpose which
[52:01] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[52:04] amen let's just bow our heads heavenly
[52:06] father lord as we've just
[52:08] opened your word lord to read the
[52:10] scriptures father
[52:11] we know only the holy ghost lord your
[52:13] spirit can
[52:15] minister it unto our hearts lord and
[52:18] open up a revelation to us oh god
[52:20] so we just pray right now oh god that
[52:21] you would break the bread of life to us
[52:24] once again
[52:25] lord may you just speak unto your people
[52:26] lord and bless your word in the name of
[52:28] jesus christ we pray
[52:29] amen you may be seated
[52:36] i was just really blessed particularly
[52:39] this wednesday on
[52:41] the little bit that we got to hear from
[52:42] our pastor
[52:45] you know and when obviously ministering
[52:48] on who is this melchizedek and
[52:50] uh we'll just probably start really slow
[52:52] here uh
[52:53] you know the lord you know i know he
[52:56] works
[52:57] in all of us in different ways and i
[52:58] know maybe he works
[53:00] by his grace through me in a way that
[53:02] might be a little bit different but
[53:03] we're just trusting that the lord will
[53:06] be able to express what you know he will
[53:10] what maybe he's shown or given to me the
[53:14] by his grace the way that he gave it to
[53:15] me but uh
[53:18] if i could maybe just give a title to
[53:19] this
[53:21] if we could preach on the fellowship of
[53:23] the mystery
[53:28] i was so impressed and and blessed by
[53:31] this wednesday
[53:33] by just a simple thought you know
[53:36] i've administered a couple times back
[53:38] even and really been
[53:41] maybe preaching on the different aspects
[53:42] of of of a person as it were how we have
[53:45] the five
[53:46] channels to the spirit and the five
[53:48] channels to the to the flesh to contact
[53:50] this world and
[53:51] so many times we rely too many on those
[53:54] things too many times on those things we
[53:56] we we take things that we call face
[53:59] value
[53:59] we see something and we just take that
[54:01] that is what it is whether it be a
[54:03] sickness or
[54:04] or something that we're dealing with in
[54:05] our lives we we can only see
[54:08] what's in front of us and what maybe
[54:10] many times we don't maybe live in the
[54:12] spiritual the way we ought to to
[54:13] understand that the lord is ultimately
[54:15] in control
[54:17] but i'm blessed by the fact that
[54:20] our prophet told us that the word of god
[54:23] will defeat satan
[54:26] in any circumstance no matter what you
[54:30] can see no matter what it looks like
[54:32] the word of god will defeat satan in any
[54:34] place anytime and under any condition
[54:37] because it isn't about
[54:40] us as it were but it's about god
[54:43] revealing himself
[54:45] and manifesting himself through
[54:48] his bride through in this time now
[54:52] us whereas before in times past the
[54:54] scripture says
[54:55] that god had revealed himself through
[54:57] the prophets and these different things
[54:59] he says he's now revealed himself
[55:00] through his son and now beyond that he
[55:04] came in the form of the holy ghost and
[55:06] is now living
[55:07] in a bride in his people to reveal
[55:11] himself to the world
[55:14] but see to the world it's a mystery
[55:18] the rest of the world the the the things
[55:21] that the hidden things of god cannot be
[55:23] understood
[55:24] by a mental conception they can't be
[55:27] understood
[55:28] by just study and reasoning and all
[55:30] those things in fact
[55:32] we understand that reasoning is what got
[55:34] us into this mess in the first place
[55:37] because satan came and said hath god not
[55:40] said
[55:41] hath not god said you shall you shall
[55:43] eat of every fruit of the tree of the
[55:45] garden and
[55:45] one of these little things that he tried
[55:47] to to pique the interest of eve in the
[55:49] garden
[55:50] and say god knows if you were to partake
[55:52] of these things you'll become as gods
[55:56] and that's what he's done in this age he
[55:58] said if you could just learn this wisdom
[56:00] this natural wisdom you can come up to
[56:02] this place
[56:03] you'll become greater than anything
[56:05] you'll become a superman a superwoman
[56:07] whatever it might be
[56:10] and to the natural man it looks really
[56:12] good
[56:14] the technology of the age has come
[56:16] higher and higher and higher and
[56:18] the the things that we understand maybe
[56:20] a quarter of the natural have come
[56:22] higher and higher
[56:23] but we see that as man has come higher
[56:25] and higher
[56:26] according to the tree of knowledge
[56:29] they've become farther and farther away
[56:30] from a knowledge of god
[56:33] and we're finding a contrast becoming
[56:35] greater and greater
[56:37] whereas one side the children of man
[56:40] would become
[56:40] greater and greater in knowledge of the
[56:42] world but the children of
[56:44] god the people of god are becoming
[56:46] actually simpler and simpler
[56:49] to the point where the only thing we can
[56:51] believe is the word of god
[56:52] no matter what it looks like no matter
[56:55] how crazy it sounds
[56:57] no matter how insane it looks to the
[57:00] world
[57:01] we've become actually more simple minded
[57:03] as pertaining to the things of the world
[57:08] why that's why paul would say in first
[57:11] first corinthians here if we turn back
[57:13] he says we're not preaching according to
[57:16] the wisdom of man
[57:20] because the carnal mind is enmity with
[57:21] god
[57:25] the carnal mind cannot understand the
[57:27] things of god
[57:31] it's just not possible too many times
[57:35] we find ourselves frustrated because
[57:40] we're trying to to force a revelation
[57:43] into somebody
[57:46] our desire so much is our loved ones
[57:49] if you could just see it you want to
[57:50] shake them if they could just see
[57:53] what i see but maybe it hasn't been
[57:56] revealed to them yet
[57:58] if they could just understand what god's
[58:00] given to me
[58:02] so many i i feel i go to work you know
[58:05] and
[58:06] worldly people all around and they'll
[58:08] talk about
[58:09] goings-on in the world we see what's
[58:11] happening now with israel and
[58:13] and all these things and we know that's
[58:14] god's timepiece so if israel's stirring
[58:17] maybe god's getting ready to stir
[58:19] something and we know even now he's
[58:21] stirring in the hearts of the people
[58:23] i've
[58:23] i've felt it even in my spirit in my
[58:25] soul god's just stirring there's
[58:27] something fixing to happen
[58:30] and you hear people talk about it in a
[58:32] carnal manner you know
[58:34] around you know you may you know rub
[58:36] shoulders with the world those of us
[58:37] that have to work around
[58:38] people that aren't believers and they
[58:40] say oh can you believe what's going on
[58:42] and they they can see that something's
[58:44] wrong
[58:45] and you just want to grab them and say
[58:47] if you could just see it's the spirit of
[58:49] god
[58:50] working it's the spirit of of of the
[58:53] antichrist beginning to stir
[58:55] and to bind up tears meanwhile
[58:58] the the wheat is being bound and drawn
[59:01] together to be placed
[59:02] into the into the garner
[59:05] but we can't do it in an intellectual
[59:08] conception
[59:09] it can't be done no matter how much word
[59:11] they could know
[59:12] people that you might know might even
[59:14] know their bible sometimes better than
[59:16] you
[59:17] i've known many denominational believers
[59:21] who could know the scripture and recite
[59:23] things front to back
[59:24] but something as simple as the baptism
[59:27] in the name of jesus christ
[59:28] would be hidden from them why because it
[59:32] it's not based upon the wisdom of man
[59:36] god actually you know god delights
[59:40] in hiding it from the wise and prudent
[59:42] he said it please
[59:44] god to hide these things from the wise
[59:47] and prudent
[59:47] but he revealed them unto babes that
[59:50] would learn
[59:52] someone that could be so simple-minded
[59:55] could i say
[59:56] that could just be so crazy enough
[59:59] to say god said it so i believe it
[1:00:03] and when someone questions you and says
[1:00:05] how shall these things be
[1:00:08] they say i don't i don't know but god
[1:00:11] said
[1:00:13] it's not my it's not my job to know
[1:00:16] and i know we've ministered on some of
[1:00:18] these things quite a few times before
[1:00:20] lately but we've got to get ourselves
[1:00:23] out of trying to understand the how and
[1:00:26] understand that it will
[1:00:29] what time it happens i don't know how it
[1:00:32] will come
[1:00:33] i don't know but i do know
[1:00:36] that his word is true and it must come
[1:00:39] to pass
[1:00:41] but see none of these things can happen
[1:00:44] before the time
[1:00:48] he that endureth unto the end
[1:00:52] he that endureth unto the end how many
[1:00:54] believe we're at the end
[1:00:56] i believe we're at the end we're right
[1:00:58] at the end
[1:00:59] con almost with your spiritual eyes it's
[1:01:02] almost as if
[1:01:03] in the spiritual you can see the finish
[1:01:05] line
[1:01:06] right there just beyond our reach
[1:01:10] but it can't come before the time
[1:01:14] and we're talking about a fellowship of
[1:01:16] the mystery
[1:01:18] you see there's a mystery that's been
[1:01:20] hidden
[1:01:21] you see god delights to hide deuteronomy
[1:01:24] says that the hidden things belong to
[1:01:26] god
[1:01:27] deuteronomy 29 29 the hidden things
[1:01:31] belong to god but the revealed things
[1:01:34] belong unto us
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:36] and so many times we get caught up
[1:01:40] oh i want to know all the hidden things
[1:01:42] you'll know
[1:01:43] what he needs you to know how will you
[1:01:46] know a rapture
[1:01:47] is taking us away and the body changes
[1:01:49] here we understand
[1:01:50] the rapture is already even in process
[1:01:53] now
[1:01:54] but how will we know what body change is
[1:01:55] going to happen you know how i'm going
[1:01:56] to know
[1:01:57] because my body's going to be changed
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:02] because god interprets his word by
[1:02:04] bringing it to pass
[1:02:06] he doesn't interpret his word by
[1:02:09] allowing me to explain it all to you
[1:02:15] that's why they didn't like brother
[1:02:16] branham so much because he spoke in
[1:02:18] parables
[1:02:20] he's spoken mysteries he spoke in a way
[1:02:23] that the scholar the theologian couldn't
[1:02:26] just put their finger on it quite
[1:02:28] why because it was a spiritually
[1:02:30] discerned revelation
[1:02:34] if it was based on intellectuals we
[1:02:36] would all miss it
[1:02:37] well most of us maybe some of you are
[1:02:39] here are really intellectual
[1:02:41] if it was based on intellectuals but i
[1:02:43] know i'd miss it if it was on
[1:02:44] intellectuals
[1:02:46] because i don't understand many of the
[1:02:47] things i wish i did
[1:02:49] my i believe everyone's desire here
[1:02:52] the desire of a holy ghost filled
[1:02:54] believer is to understand it to fulfill
[1:02:57] the perfect
[1:02:58] will of god for their life but many
[1:03:00] times
[1:03:01] we don't know what exactly lays in store
[1:03:04] for us around the corner
[1:03:06] that's why it's based on faith if it was
[1:03:09] based on what we know there'd be no
[1:03:11] faith even
[1:03:12] the lord had to even rebuke brother
[1:03:14] branham on it and say if i gave you a
[1:03:16] vision for everything
[1:03:18] you wouldn't even be walking by faith
[1:03:20] anymore because you know the visions
[1:03:22] come to pass
[1:03:24] so how much for us who don't have that
[1:03:27] prophetic gift
[1:03:28] god is delights do you know how much it
[1:03:32] delights god
[1:03:33] when his children could be in situations
[1:03:36] that they don't understand
[1:03:38] can be in places where it looks like
[1:03:40] there's no way out
[1:03:42] where the only way that they could get
[1:03:44] out is a complete mystery
[1:03:45] and they don't even know the children of
[1:03:47] god don't even know what weighs out
[1:03:49] but they can stand there and say though
[1:03:51] he slay me
[1:03:53] yet i'll trust him oh my god
[1:03:57] why because you've been sealed
[1:04:02] into a kingdom and the world
[1:04:06] cannot understand you i was so blessed
[1:04:10] how our pastor he taught he called it
[1:04:12] just a little appetizer
[1:04:13] and i was just like brother give us the
[1:04:15] main course i need some more
[1:04:18] but do you understand see we i don't i'm
[1:04:21] not gonna we're not going deep because i
[1:04:22] don't understand all these things
[1:04:23] when it comes to the seven seals and the
[1:04:25] seven thunders i wouldn't claim to know
[1:04:28] i wouldn't claim to know all that i'll
[1:04:31] know it when he needs me to know
[1:04:33] you know when it's revealed the way it
[1:04:35] needs to be revealed to me i'll know
[1:04:37] and you'll know why because we're holy
[1:04:39] ghost-filled believers
[1:04:41] that mystery already lays in the seed
[1:04:46] that acorn paul said he said
[1:04:50] we don't know what we shall be
[1:04:54] but we do know that when he comes
[1:04:57] we'll see him as he is for we shall be
[1:04:59] like him
[1:05:01] if you were to take an acorn
[1:05:04] and you just took that acorn and looked
[1:05:06] at it
[1:05:08] it does not give you an intellectual
[1:05:09] conception of what an oak tree is
[1:05:13] you can't look at an acorn unless you've
[1:05:16] already got
[1:05:17] a revelation or a previous knowledge
[1:05:21] of what that will become or what it was
[1:05:24] if you just took an acorn and placed it
[1:05:26] before you without any other
[1:05:27] intellectual knowledge
[1:05:29] of what that thing would grow into you
[1:05:31] would have no
[1:05:32] idea that that little thing would grow
[1:05:34] into this great tree
[1:05:36] yet every acorn and every other seed
[1:05:40] that would ever be born from that tree
[1:05:42] is already in that seed
[1:05:45] so is it with you children of god
[1:05:48] you don't know even what lays in you yet
[1:05:52] but rest assured that when he comes
[1:05:55] you're gonna be just like him
[1:05:58] because even right now he's molding you
[1:06:00] he's making you
[1:06:01] he is transforming you
[1:06:05] i was struck you know the scripture says
[1:06:07] be not conformed to the image of this
[1:06:09] world
[1:06:10] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:06:13] your mind
[1:06:13] and i i thought about that scripture
[1:06:15] just a couple weeks ago
[1:06:17] and i was like wow don't be conformed
[1:06:19] and i was thinking well what is
[1:06:20] conforming
[1:06:21] conforming is worse you you stuff
[1:06:24] something in there if you have like a
[1:06:25] a squishy ball and you stuff it into a
[1:06:28] square box
[1:06:29] it'll conform to the shape of the box
[1:06:32] and i thought you know
[1:06:33] that's just like how the world tries to
[1:06:35] do with a christian
[1:06:36] they try to take you and shove you into
[1:06:38] their little boxes
[1:06:39] to make you conform to what their image
[1:06:42] of a person ought to be
[1:06:43] and even worse in this day the world
[1:06:45] tries to make you conform
[1:06:47] as believers of a truth that's beyond
[1:06:50] anything the rest of the world's got
[1:06:52] they try to make you conform to what
[1:06:54] their intellectual conception of a
[1:06:56] christian is
[1:06:58] and the problem is their conception of a
[1:07:00] christian is actually none other than
[1:07:01] antichrist
[1:07:04] because their idea of a christian just
[1:07:06] goes with the flow
[1:07:07] just takes whatever's given to them
[1:07:09] doesn't stand up for the truth
[1:07:11] is it under the backbone to stand up and
[1:07:14] call right right and wrong wrong
[1:07:17] and say a christian god is love god is
[1:07:19] love
[1:07:20] their perverted version of filial love
[1:07:23] is nothing but
[1:07:24] garbage how can you claim to be a
[1:07:28] christian
[1:07:28] and don't love the homosexual and don't
[1:07:30] love i do love them
[1:07:32] but it's because we love people in sin
[1:07:34] that we come and say come out of that
[1:07:44] but the world wants you to be conformed
[1:07:48] and i thought oh my that's a dirty word
[1:07:50] conform that sounds horrible
[1:07:51] but you know the scripture wants you to
[1:07:53] be conformed
[1:07:55] we conform and as we conform
[1:07:58] we become transformed see that's the
[1:08:01] difference
[1:08:02] satan can't transform you because he
[1:08:05] doesn't have creative power
[1:08:07] he can only take what's already there
[1:08:09] and try to pervert and twist and mold
[1:08:11] and squish and move and
[1:08:13] but god if you don't got the holy ghost
[1:08:16] yet you just keep pressing
[1:08:19] you just keep conforming to this worm
[1:08:22] because as you conform to this it
[1:08:24] becomes part of you
[1:08:26] and before you know it you've been
[1:08:27] transformed
[1:08:29] hallelujah don't give up
[1:08:33] don't stop pressing
[1:08:37] that's the problem right now the
[1:08:38] scripture says that he would wear out
[1:08:40] the saints
[1:08:42] that's exactly what the devil's trying
[1:08:44] to do right now it's just wear you out
[1:08:46] wear you down it's like it's like a wave
[1:08:49] on the seashore
[1:08:50] just lapping in over and over and just
[1:08:53] trying to wear away
[1:08:54] wear away wear but i tell you what
[1:08:57] brothers and sisters
[1:08:58] if you're founded upon a rock the
[1:09:01] scripture says the waves beat
[1:09:03] and the wind blew but the but the house
[1:09:06] stood
[1:09:07] because it was founded on a rock
[1:09:12] and what is that rock it's the
[1:09:14] revelation
[1:09:16] it's the mystery that's been revealed to
[1:09:19] you
[1:09:20] and you alone
[1:09:25] i don't have brother matthew's
[1:09:26] revelation
[1:09:28] because it wasn't given to me that way
[1:09:31] i didn't come the same path but we came
[1:09:33] to the same revelation
[1:09:37] if i could say it that way see that's
[1:09:40] that's the perversion and satan he's so
[1:09:43] clever
[1:09:44] with his with his word tricks and the
[1:09:46] way he can do things because now people
[1:09:48] oh there's many paths to god
[1:09:50] and that's true in a sense
[1:09:53] everybody's life path has taken them
[1:09:56] different places
[1:09:58] some of you struggle with alcohol some
[1:09:59] of you with drugs some of you with women
[1:10:01] some of you with this and with that and
[1:10:02] with the other
[1:10:03] all these different things those were
[1:10:05] different life paths that god had to
[1:10:06] take you down
[1:10:07] but i can tell you one thing the only
[1:10:10] place that it led you to was the door
[1:10:12] jesus christ and him alone they can say
[1:10:14] oh
[1:10:15] see they take it the devil takes it a
[1:10:17] step farther and says oh it's
[1:10:18] oh it could be buddha it could be
[1:10:20] muhammad it could be this and that and
[1:10:21] the other
[1:10:22] no sir i don't care what life you came
[1:10:25] from
[1:10:25] the only truth there is is jesus christ
[1:10:36] but see you become a mystery
[1:10:41] when you're sealed into this kingdom
[1:10:44] see because what is a seal brother brahm
[1:10:47] described it many ways
[1:10:48] he taught he talked about he said it
[1:10:50] signifies ownership
[1:10:52] see there's a reason the world don't
[1:10:54] like you
[1:10:56] it's because when that seals upon you
[1:11:00] everybody can see whether they know it
[1:11:01] consciously or not
[1:11:03] those devils can see who owns you
[1:11:07] he said set a seal upon their foreheads
[1:11:10] for those who sigh and cry for the
[1:11:11] abominations done in the city and he
[1:11:13] said they went around and put the seal
[1:11:14] on the forehead
[1:11:16] he said grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:11:18] god whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[1:11:20] of your redemption
[1:11:21] see the scripture says that
[1:11:25] if you will accept the testimony of him
[1:11:27] who god has sent it says he has set to
[1:11:29] his seal
[1:11:30] that god is true oh my
[1:11:33] you want to receive the seal then you
[1:11:35] have to set him as your seal
[1:11:37] that he is true but what happened god
[1:11:40] sealed you into his kingdom
[1:11:42] and whether you see it or not you wonder
[1:11:44] why do people don't like me
[1:11:47] why do people look at me funny why do
[1:11:50] people
[1:11:52] can't understand me that's because
[1:11:56] they're not in the mystery see you've
[1:11:58] been sealed in
[1:12:00] they've been sealed out and the only way
[1:12:03] to come in
[1:12:05] is to come in the same way you came in
[1:12:08] which is to be born again
[1:12:10] because then if they come into that now
[1:12:13] they're in the fellowship of the mystery
[1:12:16] but meanwhile we walk around and the
[1:12:19] whole world all the devils of hell
[1:12:21] know who you belong to because you've
[1:12:23] been sealed
[1:12:25] you've been marked god said this is mine
[1:12:29] don't you touch it devil and don't you
[1:12:32] don't you better believe he's gonna try
[1:12:35] he's gonna batter you with everything he
[1:12:37] can but what does that seal do
[1:12:39] he said it locks you up into your
[1:12:41] destination
[1:12:43] there's nothing that can mess with that
[1:12:45] car
[1:12:46] that railroad car until it hits the
[1:12:48] destination
[1:12:51] but you become a living epistle
[1:12:58] but did you know if i could say it this
[1:13:01] way
[1:13:02] just like the seven sealed book of
[1:13:04] redemption
[1:13:06] you become a sealed book to the rest of
[1:13:08] the world
[1:13:12] you become a sealed book they can't
[1:13:15] understand you
[1:13:16] brother branham talks about the seals
[1:13:18] and how
[1:13:20] when we saw the seals in revelation
[1:13:22] before any of the real revelation came
[1:13:24] but when
[1:13:25] we read the seals how a seal was broken
[1:13:27] and there's like a little symbol
[1:13:29] he said what was it we were just seeing
[1:13:30] the outside of it a little glimpse
[1:13:34] but we couldn't truly understand we
[1:13:36] couldn't truly have a revelation because
[1:13:38] it wasn't the time yet
[1:13:40] and yet god was working the whole time
[1:13:42] throughout all those church ages
[1:13:45] those horse riders were right god was
[1:13:47] working
[1:13:48] the holy ghost moving but it was a
[1:13:51] mystery sealed up
[1:13:52] and so are you when you're sealed into
[1:13:56] this kingdom
[1:13:57] you become a mystery to the world
[1:14:01] the only thing they can see on the
[1:14:02] outside of you
[1:14:04] sisters it's a symbol they don't
[1:14:07] understand it
[1:14:08] the carnal mind can't understand that
[1:14:10] symbol of long dress
[1:14:12] long hair modesty
[1:14:16] they can't see it why because they're
[1:14:18] not inside the book
[1:14:20] only those that are in the book can
[1:14:23] understand the book
[1:14:24] [Applause]
[1:14:26] so how could they understand it that's
[1:14:28] why you can't educate someone into it
[1:14:31] it's a sealed mystery you're a sealed
[1:14:35] mystery to the world
[1:14:37] he's sealed it up locked it inside of
[1:14:40] you
[1:14:41] that's why sometimes you don't even
[1:14:42] understand the things you're doing
[1:14:46] i love the way our pastor said he said
[1:14:48] one of these days
[1:14:49] that seal on your life is gonna break
[1:14:52] and it's gonna reveal
[1:14:54] who you were the whole time
[1:14:57] that's what he did in the seals he
[1:14:59] started breaking those seals
[1:15:01] first see a white horse rider what was
[1:15:03] it it wasn't something that had just
[1:15:05] happened
[1:15:06] he was revealing what he'd already been
[1:15:07] doing the whole time
[1:15:10] hallelujah it's so
[1:15:13] fixed brothers sisters
[1:15:16] the works were finished before the
[1:15:18] foundation of the world
[1:15:23] he's hidden it from the eyes of the wise
[1:15:25] and prudent but he's revealing it to us
[1:15:28] he's revealing it we don't even
[1:15:29] understand it so many times
[1:15:31] mentally but spiritually there's
[1:15:34] something
[1:15:34] that seed inside cries out for more
[1:15:39] because it knows it can only recognize
[1:15:42] itself
[1:15:42] the word can only recognize the word
[1:15:47] that's why paul said we groan within
[1:15:49] ourselves he said and many times
[1:15:51] we utter words that we don't even
[1:15:53] understand we groan with groanings we
[1:15:56] don't understand
[1:15:57] why because there's a lot how can you
[1:16:00] mentally we've never experienced
[1:16:01] theophany
[1:16:03] we never experienced glorified bodies
[1:16:06] but there's something in us that knows
[1:16:08] what it is
[1:16:10] there's a seed in us that came from
[1:16:12] glory
[1:16:13] that's going back to glory there's a
[1:16:16] seed that
[1:16:17] knows where it's going there's a piece
[1:16:20] of you
[1:16:21] that understands without words without
[1:16:23] intellect
[1:16:24] that jesus christ is coming he's even
[1:16:27] here now
[1:16:29] he's prepping the bride to take her away
[1:16:32] and we grown for that we desire that
[1:16:36] that makes you a mystery to the world
[1:16:38] you're a sealed off book
[1:16:42] and you can't be that mystery on your
[1:16:44] life what god has in store for you
[1:16:47] and i want to take this on all the
[1:16:48] levels you can think of
[1:16:50] whether it be a rapture we're all going
[1:16:52] to be broken at that time
[1:16:53] that mystery of the rapture will be
[1:16:55] broken at the time that seal be ripped
[1:16:57] off
[1:16:58] that understanding and by seal i mean
[1:17:00] understanding i'm not talking about
[1:17:01] seven i don't understand all of all of
[1:17:03] it i can only give you what the lord's
[1:17:05] showing me
[1:17:06] but when that mystery time comes and
[1:17:08] there's something in the heart of the
[1:17:09] believer
[1:17:10] where the lord says come up hither
[1:17:14] that seal will break this
[1:17:17] seal of flesh that's been holding you
[1:17:20] down
[1:17:21] will break away and this mortal will put
[1:17:24] on immortality
[1:17:26] in the moment of a twinkling of an eye
[1:17:30] but it can't happen before the time
[1:17:34] think about think about i want you to go
[1:17:36] through the scripture now think about
[1:17:38] the mysteries that god does and how he
[1:17:41] the lord gets glory
[1:17:44] by hiding things why because
[1:17:47] if you knew you try to put your hand to
[1:17:50] it to do it
[1:17:52] oh i try to make it better oh surely i
[1:17:54] could do this
[1:17:55] surely i could do that so in order to
[1:17:58] keep
[1:17:59] our little hands off of it many times
[1:18:01] the lord has to hide it from ourselves
[1:18:04] the lord even did it with our prophet
[1:18:07] listen to the message serge is this the
[1:18:09] time
[1:18:10] is this the sign of the end brother
[1:18:11] brandon says i don't know where i'm
[1:18:13] going
[1:18:14] i don't know what i'm doing but i just
[1:18:16] know just like abraham i got to go where
[1:18:18] he tells me
[1:18:19] he could see symbols he didn't
[1:18:21] understand but he knew
[1:18:22] one thing follow god wherever he leads
[1:18:25] that's the
[1:18:26] same place he's bringing his bride to
[1:18:27] you things happen in your life lord i
[1:18:29] don't understand
[1:18:30] i don't know why i'm going where i'm
[1:18:32] going i don't know why i'm doing what
[1:18:33] i'm doing
[1:18:34] but lord i'm gonna trust you that when
[1:18:37] the time comes how many
[1:18:38] i mean we can all testify can we not
[1:18:40] that we've gone through things
[1:18:42] look back five ten years later maybe
[1:18:44] more and say
[1:18:46] lord and he reveals to you what he did
[1:18:49] he said lord have mercy
[1:18:53] if i had known what you were doing i
[1:18:54] would have messed it all up
[1:18:58] but he gets glory in that because no man
[1:19:03] has put their hand to it i was loving
[1:19:05] the old testament
[1:19:06] he said when he would build an altar he
[1:19:09] said you build an
[1:19:09] altar out of earth he said don't put
[1:19:11] your tool upon it
[1:19:13] he said if you put your tool on my altar
[1:19:15] you polluted it
[1:19:16] and many times we try to put our
[1:19:18] man-made ideas and our tools
[1:19:20] to the work of god and we end up
[1:19:22] polluting the work of god
[1:19:24] get your hands off of god's work and
[1:19:26] just let the spirit lead you where you
[1:19:28] would
[1:19:29] and you know what you'll be a mystery
[1:19:30] there will be times you're going to be a
[1:19:31] mystery to fellow believers
[1:19:34] you're going to do things that other
[1:19:35] believers say what are they doing
[1:19:40] they did it with jesus
[1:19:43] they did it with paul even peter said he
[1:19:47] says a lot of things that are hard to be
[1:19:48] understood
[1:19:50] paul's kind of a mystery to me but you
[1:19:53] know what i got a revelation
[1:19:55] he's a minister for the age i'm gonna
[1:19:57] i'm gonna believe it i don't understand
[1:19:58] it but i believe it
[1:20:01] think about jesus's life even from the
[1:20:04] very beginning
[1:20:05] a virgin shall conceive and that mystery
[1:20:08] was sealed away
[1:20:10] hundreds of years hundreds of years
[1:20:13] and then god just begins to break that
[1:20:15] open
[1:20:16] and an angel comes to mary hail mary
[1:20:18] full of grace all these different things
[1:20:20] and you're gonna have a child and you
[1:20:22] shall call his name jesus
[1:20:24] and she says well how shall these things
[1:20:27] be
[1:20:28] see even then it was just beginning to
[1:20:30] unveil
[1:20:31] unreveal itself to unveil itself and yet
[1:20:34] it was still hidden
[1:20:36] it was still it was just beginning and
[1:20:38] maybe sometimes i almost feel that's
[1:20:40] where we're at when it comes
[1:20:41] to a real revelation of of what the
[1:20:43] lord's brought in our day in this
[1:20:45] message
[1:20:46] we've we've started to to peel back the
[1:20:48] layers
[1:20:50] and the lord spoken to us and said
[1:20:52] you're going to have a child
[1:20:54] jesus christ is going to be born in the
[1:20:55] bride
[1:20:57] and we're standing here saying lord how
[1:20:59] shall these things be
[1:21:03] i don't understand anything it seems
[1:21:06] like i'm failing all the time
[1:21:08] he said the holy ghost shall overshadow
[1:21:11] you
[1:21:12] hallelujah
[1:21:16] you think she still understood it then i
[1:21:19] don't think so
[1:21:20] but she believed she went her way and
[1:21:23] believed
[1:21:24] and i feel like i just heard someone
[1:21:26] minister this recently
[1:21:27] and forgive me if if you know the lord
[1:21:30] knows i heard this somewhere i thought
[1:21:31] it was really interesting the way i
[1:21:32] heard it and i can't remember i heard it
[1:21:34] from
[1:21:34] brother branham or from another minister
[1:21:36] but i really like this because
[1:21:38] it's about the attitude that you take to
[1:21:39] the word
[1:21:41] here was here was mary
[1:21:44] not educated not any of these things and
[1:21:47] god comes
[1:21:48] and says you're going to have a child
[1:21:50] how shall i have a child not knowing a
[1:21:52] man
[1:21:52] the holy ghost shall ever shadow you how
[1:21:54] shall these things be god has grace
[1:21:56] grace grace but then you go to
[1:22:00] i think it i think actually was during
[1:22:01] the youth meetings maybe is what it was
[1:22:03] and then he goes to the priest he says
[1:22:07] this is gonna happen going to have a
[1:22:10] child
[1:22:11] and he lord how is it going to happen
[1:22:13] but he had the wrong attitude
[1:22:16] he says lord said okay you want to have
[1:22:18] that attitude see mary asked
[1:22:20] but she was like lord i don't i really
[1:22:22] don't understand but i believe
[1:22:26] i believe it was zechariah right the
[1:22:27] priest says
[1:22:29] he says lord how's it going to happen
[1:22:30] but he kind of had that attitude of
[1:22:32] almost scoffing right almost a
[1:22:33] a sarah attitude the many attitude that
[1:22:36] we get sometimes look there's no
[1:22:38] way i and i just i have to be real with
[1:22:41] you because this is the way i think
[1:22:43] sometimes
[1:22:43] we all battle i don't want to sugarcoat
[1:22:46] things it's
[1:22:47] time we've gotten beyond sugar coating
[1:22:48] things we got to get down to real
[1:22:50] business
[1:22:51] when god tells you you are going to live
[1:22:53] in overcoming life
[1:22:55] you are going to be the bride word of
[1:22:58] this age and you're going to manifest
[1:22:59] jesus christ in perfection and a rapture
[1:23:01] is going to come
[1:23:02] and you say lord there ain't no way
[1:23:06] you know what you understand that's the
[1:23:08] natural response
[1:23:10] because with the knowledge we have of
[1:23:13] this word we know how far
[1:23:15] naturally speaking we're far from
[1:23:16] fulfilling it
[1:23:18] but then when that revelation comes in
[1:23:20] when that mystery starts to
[1:23:22] to unveil itself and you realize it's
[1:23:24] not about me
[1:23:26] it's about him it's about glorifying the
[1:23:28] word of god it's about glorifying jesus
[1:23:30] christ
[1:23:31] it's not about what i look like it's all
[1:23:33] about making sure he gets the glory
[1:23:34] revealing him to the world through you
[1:23:40] but one attitude and the angel just
[1:23:42] continues to explain has grace
[1:23:44] and the other one says you're gonna be
[1:23:46] blind now for a season
[1:23:48] because you couldn't believe this he
[1:23:49] said you're a scholar
[1:23:51] you know the scriptures and then
[1:23:54] you've seen the miracles god has done
[1:23:56] you know all these scriptures and
[1:23:57] everything
[1:23:58] you know that god's able and yet you had
[1:24:00] this attitude so i'll smite your blind
[1:24:02] for a season sometimes the lord does
[1:24:04] that to us
[1:24:05] we get an attitude and the lord says i'm
[1:24:08] going to have to i'm going to paddle you
[1:24:09] a little bit
[1:24:10] but praise the lord for the chastisement
[1:24:12] because without chastising it we're
[1:24:14] bastards
[1:24:15] and we're not sons and daughters so
[1:24:17] praise the lord for the chastise
[1:24:21] but think about that from the very
[1:24:22] beginning that mystery was just starting
[1:24:24] to unveil
[1:24:25] and then it unveiled jesus is born and
[1:24:28] it's still hidden from the pharisees
[1:24:30] and sadducees and the rest of the world
[1:24:32] why because god reveals it to whom he
[1:24:34] will
[1:24:35] he will have mercy on whom he will he'll
[1:24:37] have grace on whom he will
[1:24:39] i praise the lord he's given me grace
[1:24:42] i've failed so many times i've stumbled
[1:24:45] so many times
[1:24:46] but god still hold it out to me i could
[1:24:49] never say i'm holding on to him
[1:24:50] because if it was up to me i would have
[1:24:52] given up on myself a long time ago
[1:24:56] but praise the lord the works were
[1:24:58] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:25:00] world
[1:25:02] there's a work that i've got to do
[1:25:05] there's a work
[1:25:06] that you have to do that only that part
[1:25:09] of god that he put in you can fulfill
[1:25:16] believe brother branham called it like
[1:25:17] the great orchestra
[1:25:20] with the conductor if i'm if i'm a
[1:25:22] trumpet
[1:25:24] then i can't i can't be the base drummer
[1:25:27] if i'm the bass drum i can't be the
[1:25:29] clarinet
[1:25:31] and so on and so forth down the line we
[1:25:34] we can't be what we're not meant to be
[1:25:36] but in that time
[1:25:37] you know what it's even in that
[1:25:38] orchestra timing certain parts seem to
[1:25:41] have a bigger
[1:25:42] a bigger uh part of the of the song it
[1:25:44] would seem
[1:25:45] you had that bass drum just steady
[1:25:47] beating a beat the whole time right
[1:25:50] it's just always there it's always
[1:25:51] steady it's always going
[1:25:53] it's always strong always oh you can
[1:25:56] count on that bass drum
[1:25:57] that's like a lot of people right you
[1:25:59] just count on that person
[1:26:00] and then you got the little piccolo
[1:26:04] and then they're done for like 10
[1:26:05] minutes and then
[1:26:08] that's like a lot of people isn't it
[1:26:11] they seem a little flighty
[1:26:14] they seem a little back and forth back
[1:26:15] and forth but they got a part to play
[1:26:20] you got the loud brass horns shouted
[1:26:23] from the rooftops like me and brother
[1:26:24] matthew
[1:26:25] we're a little bit louder we may be a
[1:26:28] little bit lighter it's all right we got
[1:26:29] a part
[1:26:31] but then you got that nice little mellow
[1:26:33] french horn that like really nice and
[1:26:36] mellow
[1:26:37] can just really bring a piece to certain
[1:26:39] things why because it's a gift of god
[1:26:42] for that gift i love it because god's a
[1:26:45] god of variety
[1:26:48] if all were the i where would the
[1:26:50] hearing be
[1:26:51] if all the ear where's the feeling
[1:26:54] but god is placed in the body finley
[1:26:57] joined together
[1:26:58] every piece you may not know where you
[1:27:02] fit yet but don't worry that seal's
[1:27:03] gonna break
[1:27:05] the lord's gonna positionally place you
[1:27:07] right where he needs you to be
[1:27:08] just like he did joseph joseph had a
[1:27:11] sealed life
[1:27:13] he was seeing symbols from the very
[1:27:15] beginning of his life
[1:27:18] oh you're all going to bow down to me i
[1:27:19] had this dream
[1:27:21] and even his brothers had enough
[1:27:23] spirituality about him to know that
[1:27:25] there was something to it
[1:27:27] even if they didn't like it because they
[1:27:29] even testified of what was to come
[1:27:32] oh we're gonna bow down before you
[1:27:33] actually yes yes you are
[1:27:35] you don't know it yet but what was it it
[1:27:37] was a sealed
[1:27:38] mystery a sealed book
[1:27:42] his life a complete sealed book that
[1:27:44] nobody knew
[1:27:46] didn't see you don't know where the
[1:27:47] twists and turns are gonna go
[1:27:49] because we you're not always seeing the
[1:27:51] inside of the book you're only seeing
[1:27:52] you can read the the little on a book
[1:27:55] you have the spine of the book
[1:27:57] you just read the title and sometimes
[1:27:58] you just get the cover page
[1:28:00] and it gives you like a little summary
[1:28:02] of some certain things
[1:28:03] that's sometimes what our life is like a
[1:28:06] sealed book where we can only see just a
[1:28:08] little bit you understand oh
[1:28:09] maybe this character is going to play a
[1:28:10] big part but i don't really understand
[1:28:12] what's going to happen
[1:28:14] and here he goes joseph do i don't know
[1:28:16] do you know
[1:28:17] i don't know and maybe brother branham
[1:28:18] said it i don't know
[1:28:20] when joseph maybe finally came to a full
[1:28:23] revelation of his purpose
[1:28:26] the only thing we know is what the
[1:28:27] scripture says as far as i can tell
[1:28:29] that when his brothers came to him he
[1:28:31] said the lord did this that we might
[1:28:33] spare that we might save life
[1:28:36] somewhere along the line the lord
[1:28:37] revealed it to him but you don't think
[1:28:39] joseph at times
[1:28:40] wondered what is happening
[1:28:43] why am i why am i misunderstood why is
[1:28:46] it when i try to do good evil is always
[1:28:48] present with me
[1:28:50] i tried to do the right thing in
[1:28:52] potiphar's house but evil is present
[1:28:54] with me that's how it is in this flesh
[1:28:58] you try to do right and evil is just
[1:28:59] there trying to beat you down
[1:29:02] but don't worry when the seal of your
[1:29:04] life is broken
[1:29:06] when god begins to reveal to you what
[1:29:08] she's even doing now
[1:29:10] just a little by little just a little by
[1:29:13] little
[1:29:14] he's revealing to you who you are where
[1:29:16] you belong
[1:29:17] where you came from where you're going
[1:29:20] and it's not according to the mental you
[1:29:21] say
[1:29:22] brother what are you going gonna do next
[1:29:23] month i have no idea why because
[1:29:25] the children of god as the wind bloweth
[1:29:28] so is everyone born by the spirit of god
[1:29:30] you don't know where they come where
[1:29:31] they're going
[1:29:32] and you know what many times those
[1:29:33] children of god don't know where they're
[1:29:34] coming from or where they're going
[1:29:36] but what are they doing they're
[1:29:37] following the leading of the spirit
[1:29:40] why because they that are led by the
[1:29:42] spirit of god
[1:29:43] they are the sons of god
[1:29:47] joseph just being confused i could not
[1:29:50] even imagine
[1:29:52] and his but his life was just a sealed
[1:29:53] book to the rest of him
[1:29:56] potiphar didn't know what he was pharaoh
[1:29:58] didn't know what he was
[1:30:00] until until it was all over
[1:30:03] and so are you with the rest of the
[1:30:04] world your family looks at you funny why
[1:30:07] do you go to that crazy church
[1:30:09] that cult group that believes in
[1:30:10] prophets
[1:30:12] that's what that's what people think
[1:30:14] that's okay i'm fine with that i bear
[1:30:16] the reproach it's all right
[1:30:17] they thought the same when jesus was on
[1:30:19] the scene they'll think it
[1:30:21] until the rapture comes that's all right
[1:30:23] why
[1:30:24] why are you dressed the way you do
[1:30:26] sisters your your brothers and sisters
[1:30:28] some of you may not have family that are
[1:30:30] saved why do you got a dress like that
[1:30:32] why don't you wear makeup and go out and
[1:30:34] do all the things everybody else is
[1:30:36] doing
[1:30:36] why because they can't understand you're
[1:30:39] a sealed book
[1:30:40] you've been sealed to the day of your
[1:30:42] redemption you're closed off
[1:30:44] all they can see is symbols that they
[1:30:46] can't make out yet
[1:30:48] the only way they can make it out
[1:30:49] brothers and sisters is if they're born
[1:30:51] into that same
[1:30:52] fellowship of the mystery there's a
[1:30:54] fellowship to this mystery
[1:30:56] that you can only find when you're born
[1:30:59] into the spirit of god
[1:31:01] and we can try mentally oh i wish you
[1:31:03] could see this i wish you could can't
[1:31:04] you see the scriptures yes
[1:31:05] they surely can just like the pharisees
[1:31:07] and the sadducees knew the scriptures
[1:31:09] they they say the stories go i remember
[1:31:11] hearing this from when i was a kid
[1:31:12] they said those pharisees were so
[1:31:14] studied you know because the scrolls
[1:31:16] everything was rolled up into a scroll
[1:31:18] like a tube like a poster
[1:31:20] they said they knew the scripture so
[1:31:21] good they could put a pin
[1:31:23] into the scroll and tell you on what
[1:31:25] letter that pen would stop
[1:31:27] that's how good they knew their
[1:31:28] scripture
[1:31:30] and then when their scripture became
[1:31:32] manifested in the form of jesus christ
[1:31:35] they crucified it
[1:31:36] goes to show it doesn't matter
[1:31:40] that's why the lord could say to those
[1:31:42] that were on the outside depart for me
[1:31:44] that work iniquity i never knew you it's
[1:31:47] not that he didn't
[1:31:48] know who they were but it's like that
[1:31:51] intimate relationship with a husband and
[1:31:53] a wife i never knew you
[1:31:54] i didn't know you you didn't know me
[1:31:58] my character who i am and the only way
[1:32:01] you can do that is to receive his
[1:32:02] character
[1:32:04] is to receive the spirit if that same
[1:32:06] spirit that raised up jesus christ from
[1:32:08] the dead dwell in you
[1:32:09] it shall also quicken your mortal box
[1:32:15] moses was the same way
[1:32:19] he was a sealed book really hidden
[1:32:23] he was like he was like a a super spy in
[1:32:27] a sense that god created
[1:32:29] put him right in the midst of the enemy
[1:32:32] and he was so sealed up
[1:32:33] that the enemy couldn't see anything
[1:32:35] they couldn't even see barely the
[1:32:36] symbols of it
[1:32:38] because they just let him grow up
[1:32:39] amongst them meanwhile
[1:32:41] he was taught by his mother to know he
[1:32:43] was a proper child
[1:32:44] to know he was to be a deliverer and yet
[1:32:46] his own life
[1:32:47] was hidden from himself because then he
[1:32:50] tries to go do it himself
[1:32:52] all i can see the end from the beginning
[1:32:55] i'm going to be a deliverer i'm going to
[1:32:58] rip the seal off myself
[1:33:00] and he kills an egyptian and runs off
[1:33:02] into the wilderness
[1:33:05] but then what happens then he meets his
[1:33:08] god
[1:33:11] then god really starts to reveal who he
[1:33:14] is
[1:33:15] and even then he has the objections i
[1:33:17] can't speak well the people won't
[1:33:19] believe me
[1:33:20] i can't do this and i can't do that he
[1:33:21] says never mind that moses
[1:33:24] you maybe can't see the inside of the
[1:33:26] book yet
[1:33:28] you can't see it yet but it's it's
[1:33:30] coming
[1:33:31] the manifestations coming because
[1:33:34] there's no one else that i could use he
[1:33:36] said i have chosen you
[1:33:39] have not i sent you now let's go
[1:33:44] and now now he looks even crazier to the
[1:33:47] egyptians
[1:33:48] a one-man wrecking crew a one-man
[1:33:51] invasion
[1:33:52] coming in to take over the most powerful
[1:33:55] nation on the planet at the time
[1:33:59] so were you in this age 200
[1:34:03] thousand demons released out of the
[1:34:05] river euphrates and here stands a bride
[1:34:07] of jesus christ
[1:34:10] saying you can't stop us marching
[1:34:13] forward onward christian soldiers
[1:34:15] marching as to war with the cross of
[1:34:18] jesus going on before
[1:34:22] but he became a mystery to those
[1:34:24] egyptians they couldn't understand it
[1:34:27] he says it looks like we're at number
[1:34:30] two to one
[1:34:30] janice and jamfers versus moses you had
[1:34:33] moses and aaron
[1:34:34] but he had two staff two i like the way
[1:34:36] they did it in the
[1:34:38] the the that ten commandments the the
[1:34:40] movie that they made way way back when
[1:34:42] and and they throw the sticks down and
[1:34:45] it's two snakes versus one
[1:34:47] and he says oh my goodness his snake ate
[1:34:49] up the rest of them
[1:34:51] what is it because god's just he
[1:34:53] delights in that mystery
[1:34:55] the lord delights in that underdog story
[1:34:58] that
[1:34:59] the devil always makes it he makes
[1:35:00] himself look big and
[1:35:02] and all these things it's almost like
[1:35:03] nature nature kind of shows you that a
[1:35:05] little bit of a type
[1:35:06] you see these little butterflies they
[1:35:08] got the big scary looking eyes on the
[1:35:10] back of it
[1:35:11] to scare away the frogs it's just
[1:35:13] nothing but a bluff
[1:35:14] it's just nothing to keep you away from
[1:35:16] them and that's what the devil does
[1:35:18] you know when the shadows start getting
[1:35:20] long how many of you ever remember when
[1:35:22] you're a child i was
[1:35:23] testifying this to somebody i said you
[1:35:25] know what i start to realize how much of
[1:35:27] a bluff that devil is
[1:35:28] and how the tricks he plays because
[1:35:30] remember we're in that evening time
[1:35:33] and brother branham called it he said
[1:35:34] it's a deceptive time
[1:35:37] it's a deceiving time why because the
[1:35:39] shadows start to get long
[1:35:41] the sun starts to get low on the horizon
[1:35:43] and it kind of kind of blinds you a
[1:35:45] little bit
[1:35:45] and and the light's starting to get dim
[1:35:47] but it's not so dim your eyes haven't
[1:35:49] adjusted yet you can't really see
[1:35:51] and the shadows start to get long
[1:35:52] brother brown even said that he said the
[1:35:54] evening shadows are falling right now
[1:35:56] and what happens i i thought forgive me
[1:35:59] for saying it this way but this is the
[1:36:00] way
[1:36:00] the lord kind of revealed it to me was
[1:36:02] like i thought about those cartoons when
[1:36:03] i was a child
[1:36:05] of how the character would be sitting
[1:36:06] there scared in the dark
[1:36:08] and the lights and everything and all of
[1:36:10] a sudden they see this big shadow
[1:36:11] creeping around the corner
[1:36:12] and they're like oh my and then they
[1:36:14] come around it's like it's a little
[1:36:16] kitten
[1:36:17] it's a little kitten but what was it the
[1:36:20] shadows
[1:36:21] distorted it made it look like it was
[1:36:23] something it wasn't
[1:36:25] and that's all the devil is he's using
[1:36:27] the shadows of this age
[1:36:29] to make himself all puffed up and look
[1:36:31] really bad but he's nothing but a bluff
[1:36:34] he's nothing but a toothless tiger
[1:36:36] trying to gum you to death
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:39] can't do anything to you just a little
[1:36:41] kitten
[1:36:43] so don't let the devil bluff you away
[1:36:45] from it even if you don't understand
[1:36:47] don't worry about it
[1:36:48] he's already made a way of escape
[1:36:50] [Music]
[1:36:51] if you'll stand he said when you've done
[1:36:53] all this stuff all you can't do to stand
[1:36:55] stand
[1:36:56] he'll make a way of escape if there's
[1:36:59] anybody that
[1:37:00] exemplified that more it would be those
[1:37:02] hebrew boys
[1:37:04] we've done all we can do so we're going
[1:37:06] to stand
[1:37:08] don't know how it's going to happen
[1:37:10] don't know what's how it's going to go
[1:37:11] down
[1:37:12] but all we know is that god's word is
[1:37:14] true and we're not going to give it up
[1:37:15] for some
[1:37:16] denominational creed some idea
[1:37:19] we're going to stay with this word
[1:37:22] maybe just the last little example here
[1:37:25] what about gideon
[1:37:26] gideon thought himself the least of his
[1:37:28] house
[1:37:29] but see there was a seal on him he
[1:37:31] didn't even know it and the angel comes
[1:37:33] says
[1:37:34] thou mighty man of failure and gideon
[1:37:36] says who are you looking at
[1:37:40] he was sealed up he didn't even know who
[1:37:42] he was yet
[1:37:43] didn't even know the strength that lay
[1:37:45] in there
[1:37:47] it says you mighty man a failure by thee
[1:37:49] i shall use you to help deliver israel
[1:37:53] ran away from it and he was questioning
[1:37:55] and saying
[1:37:56] lord show me this and lord show me that
[1:37:58] that's where we're at sometimes lord
[1:38:00] if you just show me this and show me
[1:38:01] that you know and there's times
[1:38:03] where you know what get before god make
[1:38:05] your calling in election sure
[1:38:08] get before the lord and say lord if you
[1:38:10] need it settled
[1:38:11] get there and stay until he settles it
[1:38:15] and then once he settles it whether you
[1:38:17] understand or not you may be a mystery
[1:38:19] you may be a mystery to yourself you
[1:38:21] don't think i think even brother brandon
[1:38:23] may have said that at one point and
[1:38:24] forgive me
[1:38:25] if i'm putting words in his mouth but i
[1:38:27] feel like i know i heard him say that
[1:38:28] what he said
[1:38:28] he said there will be times you'll be a
[1:38:30] mystery to yourself
[1:38:33] you will do things that you don't even
[1:38:35] understand why because the spirit that's
[1:38:37] in you is leading you and guiding you
[1:38:40] and the flesh doesn't understand i'm
[1:38:43] sure he thought that when he got off of
[1:38:44] that plane in memphis
[1:38:46] i'm gonna miss my flight why am i doing
[1:38:48] this
[1:38:49] how many times have we heard brother
[1:38:50] random even testify of all the
[1:38:52] testimonies he would give
[1:38:54] he would hear or feel like he heard a
[1:38:56] voice tell him to do something he said
[1:38:57] lord am i going crazy
[1:39:00] am i going crazy you're not going crazy
[1:39:04] when that when that voice lines up with
[1:39:06] the word
[1:39:08] when that still small voice is telling
[1:39:11] you to go here
[1:39:12] go there but if gideon didn't even know
[1:39:15] he didn't understand and then he has to
[1:39:17] ask over and over again
[1:39:19] lord show me this show me that and you
[1:39:20] know what the lord will do it
[1:39:22] why did he thomas we call him doubting
[1:39:25] thomas
[1:39:26] but you know why doubting thomas is
[1:39:27] there to show that even if you
[1:39:30] feel like you're in that spot god's got
[1:39:32] a place for you
[1:39:34] the devil tries to make you oh you've
[1:39:36] been struggling you've been battling
[1:39:37] you don't know this and you don't know
[1:39:39] that say if thomas can make it
[1:39:42] so can i if you can say unless i unless
[1:39:45] the lord shows me this i don't know if i
[1:39:47] can believe it you know what he'll do it
[1:39:48] for you
[1:39:49] he'll do it for you you're part of him
[1:39:52] he'll do it he's got to
[1:39:54] he's got it he's got to reveal himself
[1:39:56] to his people
[1:40:00] but we have this hidden wisdom it's a
[1:40:03] fellowship of the mystery it's a sealed
[1:40:05] book
[1:40:06] that you've been you've been literally
[1:40:08] turned into a sealed mystery to the
[1:40:10] world
[1:40:11] and i especially felt really impressed
[1:40:13] upon this with young people
[1:40:15] when you're going to school college
[1:40:18] middle school high school elementary
[1:40:19] school doesn't matter
[1:40:21] you're not going to look anything like
[1:40:23] that
[1:40:25] they're not going to understand you
[1:40:27] they're going to think you're nuts
[1:40:29] they're going to think you're crazy why
[1:40:31] because you are a
[1:40:32] sealed mystery to those people
[1:40:37] and all you can do is be that living
[1:40:40] epistle
[1:40:42] red of all men you you
[1:40:46] live the spirit of god in your life
[1:40:49] show love not the love this world shows
[1:40:51] where he just oh
[1:40:52] everything's okay but you i'm praying
[1:40:54] for you
[1:40:55] the lord's got something better for you
[1:40:57] than what you're in you know that that
[1:41:00] that what we call that love now it's so
[1:41:02] perverted
[1:41:03] oh you just tolerate whatever goes on
[1:41:05] that's their version of love no sir
[1:41:07] god doesn't just tolerate god transforms
[1:41:11] god manifests and changes and molds and
[1:41:14] and can bring deliverance to a person
[1:41:18] not just looking for a patched up job
[1:41:20] but a whole new creation creation
[1:41:22] all new creature in christ
[1:41:28] but remember the seal cannot be broken
[1:41:31] until it's time
[1:41:34] so you know what you just keep eating
[1:41:35] the word you just keep eating the word
[1:41:39] we're going to be closing here in just a
[1:41:40] second i got maybe a couple quotes to
[1:41:42] read
[1:41:45] but you know it's like uh it's like a
[1:41:48] butterfly
[1:41:50] that's the the impression the lord
[1:41:51] really really put that
[1:41:53] really strong was you know we used that
[1:41:57] that cankerworm caterpillar and all
[1:41:58] those things on the negative
[1:42:00] but you know on the positive there's a
[1:42:02] butterfly
[1:42:04] and what does that butterfly have to do
[1:42:06] it looks really
[1:42:07] ugly and nasty and weird
[1:42:10] if i could say that it just looks kind
[1:42:12] of strange but what does it do it starts
[1:42:13] to eat
[1:42:14] and eat and eat and eat and then there's
[1:42:17] that one point
[1:42:19] where it seals itself away in a little
[1:42:20] cocoon
[1:42:22] and you know what happens in there i
[1:42:23] remember this from when i was a child
[1:42:25] enough i'm wrong you forgive me but i
[1:42:26] remember
[1:42:27] there there's what they call
[1:42:28] metamorphosis
[1:42:30] and they say that that that caterpillar
[1:42:32] literally breaks itself down
[1:42:35] into almost nothing and then those
[1:42:38] molecules
[1:42:38] actually reform themselves completely
[1:42:42] into a completely new creature
[1:42:46] sealed away sealed away
[1:42:50] being broken down and i think
[1:42:53] and again i could be wrong forgive me if
[1:42:55] my science is wrong
[1:42:57] but i remember at least from when a
[1:42:59] child so my memory is going way back and
[1:43:00] i'm
[1:43:01] getting older so maybe my memory is not
[1:43:02] as good as it was but i remember that i
[1:43:04] always used to read how they say if you
[1:43:06] were to break open that cocoon
[1:43:07] before it was done it would just be a
[1:43:09] goop
[1:43:10] why because nature was taking that
[1:43:14] creature and literally
[1:43:15] transforming it down to a molecular
[1:43:17] level
[1:43:18] now i want you to think of that
[1:43:20] spiritually what god's doing to his
[1:43:22] bride right now you who have been sealed
[1:43:25] away
[1:43:26] eating on this word eating on this word
[1:43:29] eating on this word and then he starts
[1:43:32] to seal you away
[1:43:33] and put you in a secret place and you
[1:43:36] know what that secret place isn't always
[1:43:37] pleasant because you know what happens
[1:43:38] there you get broken down
[1:43:40] you know what you start to do you start
[1:43:41] forgiving you start to die to yourself
[1:43:44] you start to get broken down until no
[1:43:46] more
[1:43:47] of that old caterpillar remains no more
[1:43:52] of that old person that you once were
[1:43:54] remains
[1:43:55] the whole world doesn't see it now
[1:43:58] because you're sealed away
[1:44:00] the world may not see the transformation
[1:44:02] completely on the inside that's
[1:44:04] happening right now
[1:44:06] and that's where the devil tried oh you
[1:44:07] don't see these big things
[1:44:09] you don't see the big things but don't
[1:44:10] you worry at a spiritually
[1:44:13] molecular level god is breaking you down
[1:44:16] bit by bit
[1:44:18] and he is reforming you into his image
[1:44:21] piece by piece by peace
[1:44:24] and one of these days brothers and
[1:44:27] sisters
[1:44:28] he's gonna break that seal that that
[1:44:31] word
[1:44:32] cocoon that we've been sealing ourselves
[1:44:35] up in here
[1:44:36] he's going to break that
[1:44:39] and he's going to make manifest what
[1:44:41] he's been doing since the foundation of
[1:44:43] the world
[1:44:44] those works that have been being worked
[1:44:46] on from before the foundation
[1:44:48] lord of the works were already finished
[1:44:49] our pastor even began to
[1:44:51] preach on that a little bit how how we
[1:44:52] were already foreordained to the good
[1:44:54] works
[1:44:56] to walk in them so don't worry if you
[1:44:59] don't understand the trials and
[1:45:00] tribulations
[1:45:01] don't worry just be sealed in get
[1:45:04] shut in with god get sealed up with him
[1:45:08] and just let him start working on you
[1:45:10] let him start breaking you down
[1:45:11] and then he'll start building you back
[1:45:13] up in his image
[1:45:16] and you'll come out a beautiful
[1:45:19] manifestation of his glory
[1:45:22] when we fly away see that that
[1:45:24] caterpillar at one point was earthbound
[1:45:27] it was stuck there brothers and sisters
[1:45:29] it was stuck
[1:45:31] just crawling like a little worm but it
[1:45:34] just kept eating
[1:45:36] just eaten eaten eaten and then when it
[1:45:38] comes out it spreads its wings
[1:45:40] and it can fly off into the heavenlies
[1:45:44] oh glory to god he's got it fixed for
[1:45:46] you
[1:45:47] he's got it set just continue to eat
[1:45:50] this word
[1:45:51] get yourself sealed away with him seal
[1:45:54] yourself
[1:45:55] in seal the world out it doesn't matter
[1:45:58] how fanatical you look
[1:46:00] you look fanatical anyway
[1:46:06] so i got just a couple if i could just
[1:46:08] read i have a little bit of reading here
[1:46:09] to do but i believe there's so much
[1:46:10] good in here and then we'll be we'll
[1:46:13] close here but i just was really
[1:46:15] struck by this you know uh we'll read
[1:46:18] this one first here
[1:46:19] from paradox because you know that's
[1:46:22] what you are
[1:46:23] you're a paradox you're a mystery how
[1:46:25] can the world be going so crazy
[1:46:27] how can your life be going different
[1:46:29] which ways in this way but there's
[1:46:31] something that just holds you steady
[1:46:33] you don't you don't have to give up you
[1:46:35] don't have to just oh it doesn't matter
[1:46:37] anymore no
[1:46:38] you're a paradox you're a paradox you're
[1:46:41] a mystery
[1:46:43] he says now back in the days of noah
[1:46:45] before the rain come in the flood
[1:46:47] it was quite a hard thing for noah in
[1:46:49] that great intellectual age he lived in
[1:46:52] to try to tell people by a word of god
[1:46:54] that it was going to rain
[1:46:57] now it would be no doubt that it didn't
[1:46:59] meet the qualification of their
[1:47:00] scientific research
[1:47:02] there was no rain in the skies but you
[1:47:04] see noah said there would be rain
[1:47:06] because that god said there would be
[1:47:08] rain and noah by faith
[1:47:10] before the rain ever come he said it
[1:47:12] would be there
[1:47:14] that's the reason we say the same thing
[1:47:16] that they say why jesus said
[1:47:18] he was coming a long time ago hundreds
[1:47:20] of years ago they claimed he was coming
[1:47:22] the apostles said so maybe their
[1:47:24] generation
[1:47:25] isn't that what they said the scripture
[1:47:27] says for all things continue as they
[1:47:29] were from the beginning of creation
[1:47:31] where is the promise of his coming don't
[1:47:33] you worry it may be sealed up right now
[1:47:36] we may not understand it but it's it's
[1:47:38] coming he says that doesn't stop it a
[1:47:40] bit
[1:47:41] we still know he is coming how's it
[1:47:43] going to be i don't know
[1:47:45] but god will send him he promised to and
[1:47:47] i know he will be here
[1:47:49] now noah could only say god said so but
[1:47:52] you see then
[1:47:53] after all it did not meet their
[1:47:55] scientific approval in that day
[1:47:57] but when the time come for the word to
[1:48:00] be fulfilled
[1:48:01] it reigned just the same it was quite a
[1:48:05] paradox in that day
[1:48:06] to think that rain could come out of the
[1:48:08] sky where there is no rain
[1:48:10] it's quite a paradox for there to come a
[1:48:14] manifested bride
[1:48:16] and a body change where it looks like
[1:48:18] things are getting worse and worse
[1:48:21] but don't worry it's coming god speaks
[1:48:24] his word
[1:48:26] his children believes it and god the
[1:48:29] science cannot prove how it can be done
[1:48:31] they know nothing about it but the
[1:48:34] children believe it anyhow
[1:48:36] and then god performs i love this and
[1:48:38] that god performs
[1:48:40] a paradox makes it so
[1:48:45] the devil's got nothing to stand on he
[1:48:47] said they can't be that way
[1:48:50] god will perform a paradox to make it
[1:48:52] soul
[1:48:55] he glories in that praise the lord
[1:49:02] he performs a paradox and makes it so
[1:49:04] makes it so
[1:49:05] because his word that spoke the world
[1:49:08] into existence can bring can make every
[1:49:11] word
[1:49:12] that he ever promised come to pass i
[1:49:15] want to say that again
[1:49:17] he makes it so because his word
[1:49:20] that spoke the world into existence
[1:49:23] can bring can make every word that he
[1:49:26] ever promised come to pass
[1:49:28] how can you fret when
[1:49:31] that's the revelation when he gives you
[1:49:34] when that holy ghost seals you in
[1:49:36] and he whispers those love secrets to
[1:49:38] you and tells you you were with me
[1:49:40] before the foundation of the world how
[1:49:43] can you miss it
[1:49:44] you can't miss it because the word was
[1:49:47] already spoken
[1:49:50] it has to be done he'll perform a
[1:49:53] paradox
[1:49:55] he will bend space and
[1:49:58] time and matter around you
[1:50:02] to make his word come to pass how do i
[1:50:05] know that
[1:50:06] because heaven space and earth matter
[1:50:11] heaven and earth will pass away
[1:50:14] but his word will not pass away
[1:50:18] hallelujah he's spoken that word to you
[1:50:22] it will come to pass said the hebrew
[1:50:26] children
[1:50:27] how now how would you make the science
[1:50:31] oh i'll go up one paragraph here so
[1:50:33] that's why abraham
[1:50:34] staggered not of the promise of god
[1:50:36] through unbelief but was fully persuaded
[1:50:39] that he was able to perform and to keep
[1:50:41] that what he said he would do
[1:50:43] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:50:46] being a hundred years old
[1:50:47] and sarah 90 to have this baby because
[1:50:50] that he know that god could perform and
[1:50:53] make
[1:50:53] have a paradox to happen on something
[1:50:57] he knowed that god could have a paradox
[1:51:02] a miracle to take place and he did it
[1:51:06] how many of you know god can perform
[1:51:07] miracles
[1:51:09] he's performing miracles right now he is
[1:51:12] transforming you by the power of his
[1:51:14] word
[1:51:15] right now you don't see it it's little
[1:51:18] by little
[1:51:18] just like the caterpillar it all i i and
[1:51:21] forgive me
[1:51:22] i know there's a lot of people get a lot
[1:51:23] of discrepancies on this
[1:51:25] but i couldn't help but think of a
[1:51:26] little tent vision with that little room
[1:51:29] and those people going in their maim and
[1:51:31] halt and blinded and they come out
[1:51:33] completely whole
[1:51:34] it just made me think of that
[1:51:35] caterpillar because i thought that
[1:51:37] caterpillar goes in there all grubby and
[1:51:39] wormy looking and looking all
[1:51:41] terrible but he comes out a beautiful
[1:51:43] butterfly and what did he say he said
[1:51:44] i'll meet you in there he said
[1:51:46] no one will know anything about it and
[1:51:48] that's the secret hidden place
[1:51:50] that hidden life in christ that our
[1:51:53] prophet
[1:51:54] preached on hidden life
[1:51:57] you could only know it by being born
[1:51:58] into it it has to be that way
[1:52:01] because it's sealed away from the rest
[1:52:03] of the world and it's
[1:52:04] only revealed unto his own
[1:52:08] that's the fellowship of the mystery
[1:52:11] that's why you can't
[1:52:12] you can't truly have fellowship with
[1:52:15] with a not with someone that isn't
[1:52:16] filled with the holy ghost
[1:52:17] you can't because that fellowship
[1:52:20] doesn't go to that level
[1:52:22] that's why i it even goes to me it was
[1:52:24] almost a deeper understanding brother
[1:52:26] branham used it as a joke
[1:52:27] but that the brother said what's
[1:52:28] fellowship he said two fellows in one
[1:52:30] ship
[1:52:31] that's the truth those two fellows
[1:52:34] have to be in the same ship have to be
[1:52:37] sealed into the same body
[1:52:39] in order to have fellowship you can't
[1:52:42] have it any other way they actually have
[1:52:44] to be in the same place
[1:52:46] that's why you can meet a brother a
[1:52:48] brother or sister a believer
[1:52:50] from across the world and there's a
[1:52:52] connection
[1:52:54] there's a we sing that song there is a
[1:52:56] connection to the other side
[1:52:58] there is a connection to jesus christ
[1:53:01] you can't put your finger on it but it's
[1:53:04] there just the same
[1:53:07] oh i love it he'll perform a paradox
[1:53:10] to make his word come to pass he oh i
[1:53:13] love he did it for mary
[1:53:16] a paradox the first invitro
[1:53:20] ever done god placed a word seed in
[1:53:24] there
[1:53:25] and brought a baby out a baby jesus
[1:53:29] brought it out a paradox before science
[1:53:32] ever figured out how to do it
[1:53:33] and even better than that he didn't even
[1:53:35] need mary's egg to do it
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:38] hallelujah
[1:53:40] the lord's been the lord's been baffling
[1:53:42] science since the beginning
[1:53:44] and i love it i
[1:53:47] i enjoy science you know i say that it's
[1:53:50] just a natural i
[1:53:51] i enjoy i think it's fascinating to see
[1:53:53] even molecules and how
[1:53:55] you know these this wood is actually
[1:53:57] mostly empty space according to science
[1:54:00] all the space in between the molecule i
[1:54:02] think they said if you took an atom and
[1:54:03] blew it up to the size of
[1:54:05] the planet or something like the the
[1:54:07] size of the earth
[1:54:08] they said the nucleus would be the size
[1:54:10] of a grain of sand in the middle
[1:54:11] and then the electrons would be so far
[1:54:13] away they'd be to the moon
[1:54:16] and yet we can stand on that
[1:54:20] and god's word is further than that
[1:54:24] because that'll pass away but his word
[1:54:26] will never fail i love it but i i get
[1:54:29] almost zealous and jealous for my god
[1:54:32] when these scientists can pump their
[1:54:33] chests out
[1:54:34] and act there is no god we can prove
[1:54:37] this and prove that
[1:54:38] and their evolutionary insanity and all
[1:54:41] these different things
[1:54:42] they claim evolution and yet they said
[1:54:44] the point of evolution
[1:54:45] was to procreate a species right
[1:54:48] survival of the fittest
[1:54:50] now i'm just going somewhere with this
[1:54:51] for a second but i i just got to say it
[1:54:54] they said they said oh survival of the
[1:54:56] fitness darwin said
[1:54:58] that dog that can tolerate a colder
[1:55:00] temperature
[1:55:01] might do better because it'll breed and
[1:55:02] have another one that can do it and they
[1:55:04] can live in that climate
[1:55:05] so they said the purpose of all
[1:55:07] evolution is always to produce the
[1:55:09] species
[1:55:09] so we're evoluting higher and higher
[1:55:11] supposedly
[1:55:13] and now we find ourselves devolving to
[1:55:16] the point
[1:55:17] where they rejoice in not being able to
[1:55:19] procreate the species
[1:55:20] so what is it
[1:55:24] they rejoice in their unholy unions
[1:55:28] where they can't even produce natural
[1:55:30] life anymore
[1:55:32] and they claim that that's evolution it
[1:55:34] shows insanity
[1:55:38] but i get so jealous for my god when
[1:55:41] they try to puff themselves up
[1:55:43] and say oh there is no god oh i know
[1:55:44] he's there i met him
[1:55:47] can't take that away from me i met him
[1:55:49] on the back side of the desert
[1:55:52] i know he's real you can't take any
[1:55:54] that's why brother brown said the devil
[1:55:56] can't tell me ain't real
[1:55:57] just trying to tell me you didn't love
[1:55:58] me
[1:56:02] but science they don't even know what
[1:56:03] they're talking about when you come to
[1:56:05] if they had a moment of honesty they
[1:56:06] tell you we really don't know what's
[1:56:08] going on
[1:56:09] because every time they learn more they
[1:56:11] realize almost everything they knew was
[1:56:13] wrong
[1:56:16] i mean i i'd still joke with people
[1:56:17] about it in a sense with nutrition
[1:56:20] next year eggs are going to kill you
[1:56:22] again last year they're the only thing
[1:56:24] that's going to save you
[1:56:25] 20 years ago they were going to kill you
[1:56:27] 10 years before that is the only thing
[1:56:28] that was going to build the muscles
[1:56:30] but science goes back and forth every
[1:56:32] day don't eat the egg because the
[1:56:33] cholesterol you got to eat the egg
[1:56:35] because you need healthy fats you don't
[1:56:36] want the egg because you're going to die
[1:56:39] and people build their existence on that
[1:56:43] let's build our existence upon the word
[1:56:45] of god
[1:56:46] whether you it doesn't matter if you can
[1:56:48] understand it or not
[1:56:49] it's a it may be a mystery to you where
[1:56:51] he's leading you all the time
[1:56:53] but remember he's alpha and omega he's
[1:56:56] beginning in the end who he has
[1:56:57] justified he's already glorified
[1:56:59] i don't care how he gets me there i said
[1:57:02] i i i prayed this when the lord revealed
[1:57:05] this message to me
[1:57:06] now lord have mercy almost almost 20
[1:57:09] years ago
[1:57:10] i'm getting older
[1:57:14] i said lord i don't care what it takes
[1:57:18] i don't care if i understand it i want
[1:57:19] to make a rapture
[1:57:21] i want to live for you i want to i want
[1:57:23] to see your life expressed
[1:57:26] and i believe that's the prayer of every
[1:57:27] believer here this morning
[1:57:29] it doesn't matter if you understand it
[1:57:30] or not those disciples didn't understand
[1:57:33] they didn't understand the word and he
[1:57:34] walked with them for three and a half
[1:57:36] years but when the time came
[1:57:40] see he was fulfilling the word the whole
[1:57:41] time they didn't know it
[1:57:44] you know you know that you're fulfilling
[1:57:46] the word many times and you don't even
[1:57:47] know it
[1:57:48] because it's been sealed and hidden away
[1:57:50] from you i believe in the book of job
[1:57:52] it even says he said that god will
[1:57:54] actually implant instructions in the
[1:57:55] dreams of man
[1:57:59] that's just a little tidbit that i
[1:58:00] always found really interesting i always
[1:58:02] wondered why deja vu was a thing and the
[1:58:03] lord kind of showed me that scripture
[1:58:05] i said well praise the lord i praise the
[1:58:07] lord when i get i don't know if you've
[1:58:08] ever had that they call deja vu it's
[1:58:10] like i've been here before
[1:58:11] i say praise the lord i must be walking
[1:58:13] the path
[1:58:14] i must be where he wanted me i've been
[1:58:16] here before
[1:58:17] you know praise the lord and so is
[1:58:19] everyone and i i believe
[1:58:21] when that rapture happens and we're up
[1:58:23] at the wedding supper
[1:58:25] i believe i'm going to look at brother
[1:58:26] man i said brother manasseh we were here
[1:58:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:58:29] brother
[1:58:29] it's all becoming clear now i see him
[1:58:32] face to face
[1:58:35] we shall see him as he is because we'll
[1:58:39] be like him
[1:58:40] amen amen just a little bit more reading
[1:58:44] we're still pretty early here it's not
[1:58:45] even noon yet i hope that's okay
[1:58:47] just a little bit here trying to trying
[1:58:50] to start the slow down early so we can
[1:58:52] actually get it done properly because i
[1:58:54] know once you get inspired you just kind
[1:58:56] of go and we're trying to
[1:58:58] try to be mindful of these things see
[1:59:00] now the hebrew children
[1:59:01] now would now how would you make science
[1:59:05] believe today
[1:59:06] that man could go into a furnace i love
[1:59:09] the way brother braham says
[1:59:10] he says oh i would be afraid to say how
[1:59:12] many fahrenheit's hot it was
[1:59:14] but could go into that furnace back
[1:59:16] there in the book of daniel
[1:59:17] and stay in that furnace until they
[1:59:19] thought he they was all burnt down to
[1:59:21] ashes
[1:59:22] which every man the great army of
[1:59:24] soldiers great husky man
[1:59:26] that moved out there to throw them in
[1:59:28] the furnace those men that went in there
[1:59:30] perished
[1:59:30] by the intense heat of the furnace
[1:59:32] against them and they fell into the
[1:59:34] furnace
[1:59:34] and was down in there for all this time
[1:59:37] and come out without even the smell of
[1:59:39] fire on them
[1:59:40] god performing a miracle that was a
[1:59:43] genuine paradox
[1:59:45] of the keeping power of god against any
[1:59:48] enemy
[1:59:48] when a man is ready to admit god is true
[1:59:52] and god keeps his word and honors those
[1:59:54] who believe in him
[1:59:56] certainly i believe in a paradox and you
[1:59:59] become a paradox to the world
[2:00:01] brother branham also says in that
[2:00:02] message he says he says you become a
[2:00:04] paradox to yourself
[2:00:06] things that happen you become a paradox
[2:00:08] when god takes
[2:00:10] someone who was steeped in sin steeped
[2:00:13] in the ways of the world
[2:00:14] and completely transforms you to love
[2:00:17] the things of god
[2:00:18] that's a paradox that's a paradox
[2:00:23] now just a little bit more here if
[2:00:24] that's okay i hope i hope this is all
[2:00:26] right
[2:00:27] this is from christ is the mystery of
[2:00:28] god revealed it says get the revelation
[2:00:31] brother
[2:00:32] this generation spurning god's
[2:00:34] revelation see false prophets are doing
[2:00:36] that
[2:00:37] by their fruits you shall know them they
[2:00:40] are
[2:00:40] hybrid they are bred into an
[2:00:42] organization instead of the word of god
[2:00:45] the revelation of god revealing himself
[2:00:47] through christ
[2:00:48] who is the word oh my see that's the
[2:00:51] only way he can reveal himself is
[2:00:52] through jesus christ
[2:00:54] and the only way he can do that now is
[2:00:56] through christ in you
[2:00:58] because christ the the the physical
[2:01:01] manifestation of jesus christ is not
[2:01:03] here
[2:01:04] according to that body but he is in you
[2:01:08] and that's why it's the paradox that god
[2:01:10] would manifest these things
[2:01:13] through a body of flesh if you could die
[2:01:16] to yourself
[2:01:18] i believe that's we're going to get you
[2:01:19] down here but he says if you could just
[2:01:22] die to yourself if you could just
[2:01:24] separate yourself
[2:01:25] from all the things of the world you'll
[2:01:28] become
[2:01:29] that paradox sealed away with god
[2:01:31] because then once you pushed away
[2:01:33] all the flesh then the spirit can move
[2:01:37] but he can't move when that flesh is
[2:01:39] there to block it
[2:01:40] because that holy ghost is a gentleman
[2:01:42] he doesn't just force himself
[2:01:49] i said we could stop here he said but if
[2:01:51] get again when we come back if you want
[2:01:53] to he said now there's okay he says you
[2:01:54] want to go ahead
[2:01:55] that's up to you congregation says amen
[2:01:58] all right just a little i'll hurry
[2:02:00] but take time enough that you've got
[2:02:02] some time to rest after this all right
[2:02:04] now notice the predestinated seed the
[2:02:07] holy ghost alone
[2:02:08] shows you who he is no prophets
[2:02:11] or his kings and here god is manifested
[2:02:15] in the flesh
[2:02:16] here is the fullness he completely
[2:02:18] revealed
[2:02:19] and made known to the world oh my look
[2:02:22] on mount transfiguration
[2:02:23] when the testimony of god himself this
[2:02:25] is my beloved son hear ye
[2:02:27] him there stood moses representing the
[2:02:29] law
[2:02:30] there stood elijah representing the
[2:02:32] prophets but he
[2:02:33] they passed away and he said this is my
[2:02:36] beloved son
[2:02:37] hear ye him there was three represented
[2:02:40] there the law
[2:02:41] the prophets moses and christ he said
[2:02:43] this is him
[2:02:44] god fully not manifested in prophets not
[2:02:47] manifested by law
[2:02:49] but manifested in christ he is
[2:02:52] christ has mercy the law put you in jail
[2:02:56] but couldn't get you out
[2:02:57] the prophets is god's justice to condemn
[2:02:59] you and kill you for it that's right
[2:03:01] but jesus was god's love and revelation
[2:03:04] to let you know
[2:03:05] to a predestinated seed that he called
[2:03:07] you
[2:03:08] this is him hear him no the fullness
[2:03:12] of godhead is made known now
[2:03:17] is made known this secret of mystery is
[2:03:20] now revealed
[2:03:21] that god is manifested god and man
[2:03:24] become one the anointed man christ
[2:03:27] what does christ mean the anointed one
[2:03:30] the anointed
[2:03:31] that was anointed with the fullness of
[2:03:33] the godhead bodily oh my how can people
[2:03:35] doubt it
[2:03:36] where once partly moses had him partly
[2:03:38] david had
[2:03:39] oh my but here he is manifested in the
[2:03:42] fullness
[2:03:43] deity himself standing on earth god in
[2:03:45] his fullness
[2:03:46] to die for the sin of the people that he
[2:03:49] might bring
[2:03:50] to his church a sanctified life that he
[2:03:53] might at the preeminence
[2:03:55] in fullness in his church to manifest
[2:03:58] manifest every promise in these last
[2:04:01] days
[2:04:02] that he promised for the last days so
[2:04:04] what has he sealed us away for
[2:04:06] he sealed it in you to manifest every
[2:04:10] promise
[2:04:11] that he's promised in this last day
[2:04:14] through you
[2:04:19] he says listen now are you i'd like now
[2:04:22] just pinch yourself a little now see
[2:04:24] watch
[2:04:25] what was jesus manifested for listen to
[2:04:28] this
[2:04:29] listen very closely it says what was
[2:04:31] jesus manifested for
[2:04:32] to show god he was god
[2:04:35] he had to be no man could die no prophet
[2:04:38] could die
[2:04:39] he was god he was the god of the
[2:04:41] prophets he was the prophets
[2:04:43] he was the kings he was the history
[2:04:47] he was he that was to come he that was
[2:04:50] he that is
[2:04:50] and that's to be in this day the same
[2:04:53] yesterday today and forever
[2:04:54] he was manifested for that purpose and
[2:04:57] through that purpose
[2:04:58] he achieved a church that he the
[2:05:02] fullness of god
[2:05:03] might bring to pass every promised word
[2:05:06] of god
[2:05:06] in these last days now here's where it
[2:05:09] gets down to how is he going to do it
[2:05:12] when he gets the preeminence in the
[2:05:15] church
[2:05:16] the position his place in the church
[2:05:21] when we put jesus christ in the right
[2:05:23] place in the church
[2:05:28] jesus said he that believeth on me the
[2:05:30] works that i do shall he also
[2:05:32] even more than this shall he do for i go
[2:05:34] to my father see
[2:05:36] that was his purpose there was the
[2:05:38] manifestation
[2:05:39] and now today he wants to get somebody
[2:05:42] that
[2:05:42] can so see it that they can let the word
[2:05:46] see jesus so seen it so
[2:05:50] was so perfectly born for the day
[2:05:55] until god expressed every move that he
[2:05:58] made
[2:05:58] he was god's revelation god revealed
[2:06:03] now what is he if he wanted that from
[2:06:05] his son
[2:06:06] what does he want from his sons and
[2:06:08] daughters
[2:06:10] he wants us to be so in line in tune
[2:06:13] with the word
[2:06:15] until every move is a manifestation of
[2:06:19] that word
[2:06:20] everything that we do and say is a
[2:06:22] manifestation of it
[2:06:24] that's a sealing away brothers and
[2:06:26] sisters that's a locked away with christ
[2:06:29] that's a complete prisoner now
[2:06:32] he's sanctified with his spirit and
[2:06:34] blood a church
[2:06:36] that he might make every promise in this
[2:06:38] last day be revealed
[2:06:40] now see he could go back and pick up
[2:06:42] what these others other fellows have
[2:06:43] left
[2:06:44] off here in the last days and by his
[2:06:45] holy spirit reveal all the mystery of
[2:06:47] the seventh seal see
[2:06:49] he is expressing himself that's his
[2:06:51] purpose that's why he died
[2:06:53] that's the second fold of his threefold
[2:06:55] manifestation
[2:06:56] first to express himself in christ then
[2:06:59] to express
[2:07:00] himself through the church
[2:07:03] and the same thing christ was the word
[2:07:05] and the church becomes the word
[2:07:07] when it lets the word go through them
[2:07:13] see you've been you've been
[2:07:16] turned into a sealed book and the only
[2:07:19] thing that can be sealed inside is the
[2:07:21] word
[2:07:23] that's that's all that can be sealed
[2:07:24] inside there is the word god is not
[2:07:26] going to let
[2:07:27] he's not going to coexist with the world
[2:07:30] that's why he said if you love the word
[2:07:32] of the things of the world the love of
[2:07:33] god is even in you
[2:07:34] because god won't share the throne
[2:07:38] with anybody he will not share the
[2:07:40] throne of your heart
[2:07:41] with anything and it's time that we put
[2:07:44] god first
[2:07:46] you're gonna look crazy to the world
[2:07:48] you're you're a sealed up thing but
[2:07:49] don't you worry about it
[2:07:50] even if you can't see what's happening
[2:07:52] in your life that word is working on you
[2:07:55] you just keep eating you just keep
[2:07:57] sealed away with god
[2:07:59] shut in with god in a secret place there
[2:08:02] in the spirit beholding his face
[2:08:04] gaining new power to run in the race
[2:08:08] that's where you gain the power it's to
[2:08:10] be shut in with him
[2:08:12] they that wade upon the lord shall renew
[2:08:14] their strength
[2:08:16] if you feel weak shut in with god get
[2:08:19] sealed back away
[2:08:20] remember just many of us sometimes we
[2:08:23] feel so far away from god
[2:08:25] but maybe we've just grieved that dove
[2:08:26] away just for a season
[2:08:28] brother branham said he'd just fly over
[2:08:30] on the other branch because he's timid
[2:08:32] the the holy ghost can't dwell with
[2:08:34] dirty things
[2:08:36] they just can't do it but if you just
[2:08:39] clean it up
[2:08:41] maybe rededicate yourself as we'd all
[2:08:44] stand
[2:08:46] we'll have the musicians come
[2:08:51] maybe it's time we just each one of us
[2:08:53] maybe just rededicated ourselves to him
[2:08:56] say lord seal me away lord make me a
[2:08:59] mystery to the world
[2:09:01] i want the world to be a mystery to me
[2:09:05] i want to be ignorant to the devices of
[2:09:07] the world
[2:09:08] i don't want to i don't want to partake
[2:09:11] of their ideas and their thoughts and
[2:09:12] their mannerisms and the way they live
[2:09:14] their lives
[2:09:15] i want them to be a mystery to me
[2:09:18] lord make me a mystery to them seal me
[2:09:22] away with the word
[2:09:24] lord make me part of you a deeper
[2:09:27] revelation a deeper walk
[2:09:29] a deeper love a deeper manifestation
[2:09:32] that's what he's longing for before for
[2:09:33] his church
[2:09:35] brother ram said it right there he said
[2:09:37] he said if you could
[2:09:38] give god the preeminences what does that
[2:09:41] mean the first place
[2:09:43] the number one spot if you have
[2:09:45] preeminence it means everything else
[2:09:46] steps aside
[2:09:48] and lets him go through let him have the
[2:09:51] preeminence
[2:09:52] and he'll see you'll see a paradox begin
[2:09:54] to work
[2:09:56] god will start transforming your life in
[2:09:58] ways you won't even understand how it's
[2:09:59] going
[2:10:00] naturally but the spirit man will
[2:10:02] rejoice
[2:10:03] you'll have that it'll be that
[2:10:04] fellowship of a mystery
[2:10:07] that you can share one with another
[2:10:08] words can't express it
[2:10:10] of how much you love the lord jesus of
[2:10:13] what he's done for you truly
[2:10:15] but you could just say lord i'm not what
[2:10:18] i want to be
[2:10:20] and i'm not what i ought to be but i
[2:10:22] know i'm not what i used to be
[2:10:27] and if there's just that even little
[2:10:28] spark inside of you that's desiring more
[2:10:31] of god
[2:10:32] he's not done with you he's not finished
[2:10:35] with you
[2:10:36] this bride's moving up you know what
[2:10:39] he saw it in the vision we see the
[2:10:42] stumblings going on even now
[2:10:44] where that bride looked like she was
[2:10:45] starting to get out of step
[2:10:47] but there was a voice that said get back
[2:10:48] in line
[2:10:51] so if there's a voice to do that if
[2:10:53] there's a call from god
[2:10:55] for us to get back in line then he's got
[2:10:57] a wave he's got a way made for us
[2:11:00] to get where we need to be and i tell
[2:11:02] you what it's going to be a paradox
[2:11:06] some of you look at your lives you look
[2:11:08] in the mirror of the word and you look
[2:11:09] at your life say lord
[2:11:10] i don't see a way but you know what he
[2:11:13] makes a way
[2:11:14] where there is no way i believe when the
[2:11:18] the brother had that testimony he said
[2:11:20] you believed god so much he said yeah
[2:11:22] what if god told you
[2:11:23] to jump through that wall he said you
[2:11:25] know what either god's
[2:11:26] gonna make a way for me to get through
[2:11:27] it or he's gonna transport me to the
[2:11:29] other side
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:31] but if he told me to do it he's gonna
[2:11:33] make a way
[2:11:34] and i don't know about you but i just
[2:11:36] know for me i can only testify he told
[2:11:37] me i'm gonna make a rapture
[2:11:40] he gave me the holy ghost he filled me
[2:11:43] with his spirit for a purpose
[2:11:46] to manifest what did he say he said what
[2:11:48] was the purpose of jesus
[2:11:49] to express god to the world
[2:11:53] that's your purpose is to express jesus
[2:11:56] christ to the world
[2:11:58] jesus was a mystery to those people
[2:12:00] there
[2:12:01] even the one that's believed it he was a
[2:12:04] mystery for a time
[2:12:05] so don't don't get discouraged if your
[2:12:08] family members that you're
[2:12:09] that you're praying for and you're
[2:12:11] battling for
[2:12:12] and and just struggling saying lord i
[2:12:14] need a breakthrough
[2:12:16] nobody seems to get it don't you worry
[2:12:19] that seal is going to break for them
[2:12:22] that revelation is going to come why
[2:12:25] because he promised it
[2:12:27] he promised him let's just bow our heads
[2:12:34] heavenly father lord
[2:12:38] lord we just rejoice in the finished
[2:12:40] work of calvary
[2:12:43] lord that the works were finished from
[2:12:44] before the foundation of the world lord
[2:12:48] we've
[2:12:48] entered into that rest lord lord you
[2:12:51] said there was a promise of entering to
[2:12:53] the rest
[2:12:54] and lord we've entered into that rest
[2:12:56] lord if there be any here that has not
[2:12:58] entered into that rest oh god
[2:13:00] may you just let them not sleep day or
[2:13:01] night lord
[2:13:03] until it manifests in their life lord
[2:13:06] until there's a revelation made until
[2:13:08] they meet you on the backside of the
[2:13:09] desert face to face
[2:13:11] where lord they're just sealed away into
[2:13:13] the kingdom of god

[2:13:33] world creep in here and there
[2:13:36] lord we've gotten worn out sometimes as
[2:13:39] the scripture says the devil's trying to

[2:13:48] god
[2:13:50] to know lord that when the enemy comes
[2:13:51] in like a flood the spirit of god would
[2:13:53] raise up a standard against it

[2:21:06] through me

[2:21:18] chosen bride of jesus christ that he has
[2:21:21] foreordained you
[2:21:23] to manifest the word of the hour how do
[2:21:26] you know when it's going to happen
[2:21:27] well maybe maybe you've been believing
[2:21:29] so long and you started to wonder
[2:21:32] is it way off down the road how am i
[2:21:36] going to receive the strength
[2:21:38] don't don't you wonder that sometimes
[2:21:39] how am i ever going to restreet receive
[2:21:41] the strength how am i ever going to
[2:21:42] receive
[2:21:43] the faith to manifest the word that's
[2:21:46] been spoken in the end time
[2:21:48] well how are you going to receive the
[2:21:50] strength how are you going to receive
[2:21:51] the faith
[2:21:53] it was contained in the mystery of those
[2:21:55] seven seals
[2:21:58] the scripture says that sarah received
[2:22:01] strength
[2:22:02] to conceive so what happened there
[2:22:05] just before the promised son arrived
[2:22:08] there came melchizedek
[2:22:11] melchizedek came walking by and came by
[2:22:14] their way and what did he ask abraham
[2:22:16] where's thy wife sarah and he performed
[2:22:20] the sign of the messiah discerning the
[2:22:21] thoughts and intents of the hearts
[2:22:24] and what did that do that sparked a
[2:22:26] change
[2:22:28] in abraham and sarah to bring forth the
[2:22:31] promised son
[2:22:33] and whatever we received oh who is this
[2:22:36] melchizedek
[2:22:37] who is it that came and revealed the
[2:22:39] seven seals
[2:22:40] what was the purpose of that was to
[2:22:42] bring a rapturing faith to the bride
[2:22:45] and as we're feeding upon that word even
[2:22:47] as our brothers point out right now
[2:22:49] you're being
[2:22:50] changed you have now entered into the
[2:22:52] rapture
[2:22:53] cycle the change of your body is
[2:22:55] actually happening
[2:22:56] right now oh i imagine that abraham and
[2:22:59] sarah as
[2:23:00] as melchizedek went on and now he said
[2:23:03] according
[2:23:04] to the time of life you shall have a son
[2:23:07] well maybe they didn't feel any
[2:23:09] different right then maybe the
[2:23:11] next day it sounded like abraham said
[2:23:12] the same exact thing sarah do you feel
[2:23:14] any different
[2:23:16] no no i i don't i don't feel any
[2:23:18] different but
[2:23:20] according to his word he said according
[2:23:23] to the time of life
[2:23:25] and the bride is now in that same cycle
[2:23:28] according to the promised word how is it
[2:23:31] going to happen oh like brother randy
[2:23:32] said i don't know
[2:23:34] but he promised it one step at a time
[2:23:37] just keep feeding on that word
[2:23:39] because any moment in a twinkling of an
[2:23:41] eye
[2:23:43] the seal is going to break our bodies
[2:23:46] are going to be changed
[2:23:47] and we'll enter into that full
[2:23:48] expression of that theophany body
[2:23:51] forever to be with our lord amen
