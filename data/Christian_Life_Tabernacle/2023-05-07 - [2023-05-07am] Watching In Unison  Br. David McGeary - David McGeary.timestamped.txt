[20:09] good morning good morning welcome to the
[20:12] house of the Lord
[20:15] pray that he
[20:17] feel this morning that
[20:19] this is the best place that we all could
[20:21] be amen here on planet Earth you think
[20:25] my others lots of other places I'd
[20:27] rather be but in his presence is where
[20:30] we want to be
[20:31] and uh
[20:33] I think we'd be remiss this morning if
[20:35] we didn't remember
[20:37] the family members of the victims of the
[20:39] Rampage shooting that
[20:41] just occurred it's uh
[20:44] a sign of the times truly
[20:52] um
[20:54] if we allow it to it can
[20:58] it can
[20:59] offset our faith and believe in who's in
[21:02] control but
[21:04] God's got everything in control and he
[21:06] knows all
[21:10] and job said
[21:13] that hell is naked before him
[21:17] in destruction hath no covering and
[21:21] Solomon repeats that
[21:24] and he says it this way
[21:26] and hell in destruction
[21:28] or before the Lord how much more then
[21:30] the hearts of the Children of Men
[21:36] so there's a blessing
[21:39] to be had by following his word and
[21:43] stand within the protection
[21:45] of that mighty tower the name of the
[21:48] Lord amen
[21:50] we're going to talk very briefly
[21:52] and it's uh
[21:54] it's easy when you have a captive
[21:55] audience just to go on and on and on
[21:58] we don't want to do that this morning we
[22:00] want to
[22:02] talk about a Bible character
[22:05] you know there's uh there's many
[22:07] characters we can relate to in the Bible
[22:10] and uh
[22:13] positive connotation and negative
[22:15] connotation but I believe if we'll look
[22:17] at it in the right manner there's a
[22:19] positive connotation even in the
[22:21] negative
[22:22] so-called negative characters in The
[22:24] Bible because they were all for a
[22:25] purpose
[22:26] one of those would be naming help me
[22:28] remember his name
[22:31] um
[22:32] I
[22:34] for weeks now I've just kind of Fallen
[22:36] back in red and red and red and how
[22:39] brother Brown referred to Naaman
[22:42] um
[22:45] and Hebrews Assyrian
[22:50] he was a captain of the host of the
[22:52] Syrian Army
[22:55] and second Kings chapter 5 talks about
[22:58] him
[22:59] and said he was a great man with this
[23:01] master
[23:02] in his honorable
[23:04] because he'd LED away he'd the Lord
[23:07] blessed him it's hard for us to imagine
[23:09] this is the enemy camp but the Lord
[23:12] blessed him
[23:13] by Leading captive
[23:16] and given Deliverance unto Syria
[23:20] maybe some mighty man at Valor
[23:24] and there's a butt he said but he was a
[23:26] leper
[23:32] and when they were out on their
[23:34] campaigns they brought back a little
[23:40] a little maid
[23:42] from the camp of Israel and she was
[23:44] tending
[23:46] naaman's wife
[23:55] and she had a testimony even in the
[23:58] enemy's camp
[23:59] she said I would that my Lord would be
[24:01] in Samaria here's there's a prophet that
[24:04] can that can heal him of that leprosy
[24:07] when that message got to the king
[24:13] it didn't take long he sent a letter
[24:16] sent Messengers
[24:18] and a large sum of money
[24:23] the Bible says I will send a letter into
[24:25] the king of Israel and he departed two
[24:26] with ten talents of silver and six
[24:29] thousand pieces of gold and 10 changes
[24:31] of Raymond
[24:33] I looked up that
[24:36] silver and gold twenty thousand dollars
[24:38] in silver thirty three thousand dollars
[24:41] in gold and I would imagine the changes
[24:43] of Raymond probably
[24:45] were more beneficial and helpful than
[24:48] all the money
[24:50] you think how hard it is just to weave a
[24:52] garment you think 10 changes of Raymond
[24:54] you have to have quite a quite a tent
[24:56] just to hold that
[25:00] but here's Naaman
[25:02] he goes to the
[25:06] to the house of Elijah Elisha rather
[25:09] pulls up in his chariot
[25:13] and expects the man of God to come out
[25:15] and just lay his hands on him speak the
[25:17] word
[25:19] he doesn't do that he sends us his
[25:21] messenger
[25:22] he sent gehazal out
[25:25] with the message said go wash in the
[25:27] River Jordan seven times a dip
[25:30] and the Bible says that Naaman was Roth
[25:32] he was very angry this is surely come
[25:35] out here
[25:39] sometimes we expect the Lord to do
[25:42] what we want him to do rather than what
[25:45] his word says he would do
[25:50] so he told me go dip seven times in the
[25:52] Jordan River it was a dirty River
[25:55] and brother Bram talks about it he says
[25:57] I can just see him on his high horse
[25:59] getting down
[26:00] getting in the water says like a tomcat
[26:02] and molasses you know High stepping down
[26:04] there
[26:05] and I imagine it was painful open sores
[26:08] on your skin and thinking boy he says
[26:10] the rivers of Damascus are cleaner than
[26:12] these par and abana they're they're much
[26:15] cleaner than the Jordan why do I have to
[26:17] wash here brother Brown types that
[26:19] several times when he's in discernment
[26:21] talking about
[26:23] at least come and do what the Lord says
[26:29] and we know
[26:30] he was encouraged by his servants as
[26:33] they just do what he asked just do what
[26:34] he has to remind him say stay in the
[26:36] word stay in the word
[26:38] and he dipped seven times in his skin
[26:40] says was like a babies or like a child
[26:43] came back to him
[26:47] and he returned to the man of God and
[26:48] wanted to pay him all this money he says
[26:50] no I'm not going to take it I'm not
[26:51] going to take it it says go on your way
[26:55] and he realized
[26:57] the blessings and where to come from and
[26:59] he wanted to submit himself but he would
[27:01] still beholden to his master
[27:03] he said well I'll tell you this when I
[27:05] go in the house of Remnant the false
[27:07] gods is that I I hold his hand and I
[27:10] kneel down he said forgive me for that
[27:13] he knew it was the wrong kind of worship
[27:16] he said at least allow that
[27:19] transgression to bypass just
[27:21] have mercy on me
[27:23] I appreciate that
[27:27] and then we know the story goes on that
[27:29] gehaza followed after him he says Oh my
[27:32] he didn't charge him anything for that
[27:34] I'm going to take some blessings of that
[27:36] and ran after him
[27:38] and he took
[27:39] what he wanted
[27:42] or what he thought was beneficial he
[27:44] says oh there's two talents for me and
[27:47] he he said we've got other Messengers
[27:48] coming
[27:49] of course he comes back to Elisha he
[27:52] says wither go us thou gets I said oh I
[27:55] didn't go anywhere
[27:57] you can't get by with it
[28:00] own up to it just
[28:02] let the Lord correct you and make it
[28:03] right
[28:06] turns out
[28:07] the Bible says that the leprosy of
[28:09] Naaman
[28:12] now
[28:13] sounds strange
[28:16] but that was put on Naaman that was
[28:18] destined for Naaman there are trials
[28:20] struggles that we go through that are
[28:22] our specific
[28:24] the Lord can Deliver Us from them all
[28:27] but the lepers said Naaman
[28:29] came on gehaza and he was white as snow
[28:34] and I I believe following the scriptures
[28:36] that he continued to serve the prophet
[28:38] that he never was recovered of is
[28:40] leprosy
[28:43] there's many many lessons in that story
[28:48] I'd like to read you what brother Brown
[28:49] said about
[28:51] the girl's testimony
[28:56] and it's in the message that's
[28:57] Supernatural
[28:59] this is just an excerpt
[29:05] so they had a little girl there now I
[29:06] want to show you the force of a
[29:08] testimony of a child who lived in a
[29:11] nation or perhaps a family
[29:13] who was under the influence of God
[29:16] she loved her master and her misters
[29:18] so in which he'd seen Naaman probably a
[29:21] good-hearted good-natured man as far as
[29:22] we know according to history
[29:25] Elijah had never healed a man with
[29:26] Leprosy there'd never been a leper case
[29:28] healed in his day
[29:30] but the little girl
[29:32] being raised and brought up under the
[29:33] influence over in Israel yet in Alien
[29:36] that's us
[29:39] she was conducting herself as a believer
[29:43] and that's the way we should do all the
[29:44] time is conduct ourselves no matter what
[29:47] our position is conduct ourselves as
[29:48] Believers ready at all times to give an
[29:51] answer for the hope that lies within you
[29:54] you see it
[30:01] and I'll follow up with this and we'll
[30:03] get right to our psalm it's in the same
[30:06] message just a little farther down
[30:13] he said there's many people today that
[30:15] doesn't know Jesus Christ is still alive
[30:17] they don't know that he steal rules and
[30:19] Reigns they don't know that the blood of
[30:21] Calvary for the all-sufficiency that's
[30:24] even purchased there the cross for your
[30:26] transgressing aggressions and your
[30:28] healings
[30:29] they don't know that that's real today
[30:32] we need some more Little Maids to go
[30:34] around to testify of these things don't
[30:36] you think so get in the atmosphere of it
[30:40] It's Not Afraid what the world says
[30:43] because while they're talking about the
[30:45] world they're still in another
[30:45] atmosphere you're talking to the sinner
[30:49] but you're not in his atmosphere
[30:52] and you're in such a glorious and
[30:54] shrouded in then Shekinah Glory all
[30:57] around you and the veils of the world
[30:59] hid
[31:01] you can talk to the worldly women or the
[31:03] worldly men
[31:04] or whoever it is and still live
[31:07] in this that Shekinah Glory telling them
[31:10] of a loving God that's raised from the
[31:13] dead amen that's my desire this morning
[31:15] amen Let's uh let's stand we'll read
[31:18] psalms
[31:20] 73
[31:24] kind of a
[31:27] mid-lengthy
[31:29] Psalm
[31:31] um
[31:33] I'd certainly encourage you to go back
[31:36] and study it completely we're just gonna
[31:38] read it
[31:40] as the old saying is let the ships fall
[31:42] where they may
[31:46] let's just read it together psalm 73.
[31:49] truly God is good to Israel even to such
[31:53] as our of a clean heart but as for me my
[31:56] feet were almost gone my steps had well
[31:59] and I slipped for I was envious at the
[32:02] foolish when I saw the prosperity of the
[32:04] wicked for there are no bands in their
[32:07] death but their strength is firm they
[32:10] are not in trouble as other men neither
[32:12] are they plagued like other men
[32:14] therefore Pride can passeth them about
[32:17] as a chain violence covered them as a
[32:20] garment their eyes stand out with
[32:22] fatness they have more than heart could
[32:25] wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly
[32:28] concerning oppression and they speak
[32:30] loftily they set their mouth against the
[32:33] heavens and their tongue walketh through
[32:35] the Earth therefore his people return
[32:37] hither and Waters of a full cup are
[32:40] wrung out to them and they say how does
[32:42] God know in is there knowledge in the
[32:45] most high behold these are the ungodly
[32:48] who prosper in the world they increase
[32:51] in riches verily I have cleansed my
[32:54] heart in vain and washed my hands and
[32:56] energy for all the day long have I been
[32:59] plagued and chastened every morning if I
[33:02] say I will speak thus behold I should
[33:05] offend against the generation of thy
[33:07] children when I thought to know this it
[33:10] was too painful for me until I went into
[33:12] the sanctuary of my of God then
[33:15] understood I therein surely thou did set
[33:19] them in Slippery places thou casted them
[33:21] down into destruction how are they that
[33:24] brought into desert as in a moment they
[33:28] are utterly consumed with Terrors as a
[33:31] dream when one awakeneth so Lord when
[33:33] thou wait this awakens Thou shalt
[33:36] despise their image thus my heart was
[33:39] grieved and I was pricked in my Reigns
[33:41] so foolish was I and ignorant I was as a
[33:45] beast before thee nevertheless I am
[33:48] continually with thee thou has hold in
[33:50] me by my right hand Thou shalt guide me
[33:53] with thy counsel and afterward receive
[33:55] me to Glory whom have I in heaven but
[33:59] thee and there is none upon Earth that I
[34:01] desire beside thee My Flesh and my heart
[34:04] faileth but God is the strength of my
[34:07] heart and my portion forever for Lo they
[34:10] that are far from thee Shall Perish thou
[34:13] has destroyed all them that go ahoring
[34:16] from thee but it is good for me to draw
[34:18] near to God I have put my trust in the
[34:21] Lord God that I may declare all thy
[34:24] Works amen blessed be the name of all
[34:29] God bless you have your seats

[1:03:28] that you'd even be mindful of man
[1:03:32] Lord that you would even love us so much
[1:03:35] that
[1:03:36] you would give us your only begotten son
[1:03:40] that his blood could cleanse us from all
[1:03:43] unrighteousness
[1:03:45] and that he could impart to us eternal
[1:03:48] life
[1:03:49] oh Father we don't have words of praise
[1:03:55] we don't have vocabulary
[1:03:58] to exalt you to where you need to be
[1:04:01] exalted
[1:04:03] but we just asked today that you would
[1:04:06] extend your love and your mercy to us
[1:04:08] once more
[1:04:10] bless us in your word
[1:04:13] strengthen our faith
[1:04:16] in Jesus name we pray
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:21] amen amen you love the Lord this morning
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:28] he certainly want to thank everybody for
[1:04:31] all the effort and work you've put into
[1:04:33] the building next door it's slowly
[1:04:35] coming up
[1:04:37] and we're grateful for that and we also
[1:04:39] want to thank brother Orlando for all
[1:04:42] the videos that he's taken and provide
[1:04:44] him for Us online we're very
[1:04:46] appreciative of that let us open our
[1:04:50] Bibles this morning to Nehemiah
[1:05:05] and we're just gonna just kind of go
[1:05:09] through the fourth chapter just a little
[1:05:11] bit this morning and glean from it
[1:05:14] some things that I think will help our
[1:05:17] lives and bless us this morning
[1:05:24] in the fourth uh
[1:05:28] chapter and
[1:05:30] um
[1:05:31] you just bear with me on uh
[1:05:35] the names here I don't know most of your
[1:05:38] names or know how to say most of your
[1:05:40] names so don't expect me to say these
[1:05:43] ancient names
[1:05:45] amen it says but it came to pass
[1:05:49] that when
[1:05:50] sin uh
[1:05:53] bailout heard that we built the wall he
[1:05:58] was Wrath and took great indignation and
[1:06:03] mocked the Jews
[1:06:04] and he spoke before his Brethren and the
[1:06:08] army of Samaria and said who do these
[1:06:13] feeble Jews
[1:06:16] what do these feeble Jews will they
[1:06:19] fortify themselves
[1:06:21] will they sacrifice
[1:06:24] will they make an end in a day
[1:06:27] will they revive the stones out of the
[1:06:32] heaps of the rubble
[1:06:35] which are burned
[1:06:37] amen I say yes
[1:06:40] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[1:06:43] word to us in Jesus precious name we
[1:06:46] pray amen
[1:06:48] God bless you may be seated
[1:06:58] we want to just kind of go through the
[1:07:01] fourth chapter and a lot of what that
[1:07:04] were uh
[1:07:07] doing in this uh
[1:07:10] going through the scriptures is is has a
[1:07:15] two-fold purpose
[1:07:17] not only to
[1:07:19] study the word but also to encourage our
[1:07:23] hearts to read the scripture
[1:07:26] and if I could say it this way not that
[1:07:29] I'm any form of teacher at all I just
[1:07:34] believe the word of God
[1:07:36] and I believe what the prophet says
[1:07:39] about the scriptures he said if you
[1:07:41] don't see Jesus Christ in every verse go
[1:07:44] back and read it again
[1:07:47] and I also believe what he said he said
[1:07:50] put yourself in the story
[1:07:53] put yourself in the scripture so okay
[1:07:56] don't just read the scripture like it's
[1:08:01] another day read the scripture in your
[1:08:04] day in your circumstance
[1:08:07] identify with the characters realize
[1:08:11] that they're just men and women like you
[1:08:14] are with the same passions the same
[1:08:17] mental battles the same concerns and
[1:08:21] worries and all those things are the
[1:08:24] same so when you begin to
[1:08:28] approach the scriptures that way then
[1:08:32] then you can you can read them and and
[1:08:35] uh
[1:08:37] uh take something from it and receive
[1:08:41] something and the Lord can speak to your
[1:08:44] heart
[1:08:45] and so from it's that approach that if I
[1:08:50] could say that that um
[1:08:52] uh we're learning how to read our Bibles
[1:08:55] and we're gleaning from the Bible and
[1:08:58] we're going through the scripture and
[1:09:01] you know a lot of people uh it's like
[1:09:05] this message we know that we've received
[1:09:08] the prophet's message
[1:09:10] we know that this message was promised
[1:09:13] to us in the scripture so it wasn't
[1:09:17] something that William Branham sat down
[1:09:20] and read the Bible and he said oh we
[1:09:22] need a prophet I think I will be a
[1:09:25] prophet
[1:09:26] no that's not how it ever works it was
[1:09:31] he was
[1:09:32] The Vessel
[1:09:34] by which God fulfilled the scriptures
[1:09:39] that were prophesied for this day
[1:09:43] it could have been and I don't mean this
[1:09:46] in any form if God would have made you
[1:09:49] and prepared you for that office any man
[1:09:54] could have filled that office that God
[1:09:56] made and prepared for it you understand
[1:09:59] what I'm saying it wasn't an arbitrary
[1:10:02] choice that he said it was it was what
[1:10:07] was biblically promised and so a lot of
[1:10:10] times people say well you're you're
[1:10:13] built on on on the prophet and we're
[1:10:19] we're not built on the man per se but we
[1:10:24] can't separate the man from the prophecy
[1:10:27] because he was the prophecy fulfilled so
[1:10:31] if you were to ask me show me Malachi 4
[1:10:34] 5. Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 7 show me
[1:10:40] that I would have to say
[1:10:45] that's it
[1:10:48] because that's it it was made flesh
[1:10:52] the word of God's always made flesh it's
[1:10:56] always manifested and so we we learned
[1:11:00] that we just we take it back
[1:11:03] beyond the time that this scripture was
[1:11:07] put together we go all the way back to
[1:11:10] the beginning of the spoken word when
[1:11:14] God thought it and we understand that he
[1:11:17] knew the beginning from the end he has
[1:11:20] this whole thing thought out
[1:11:23] if I could use that like we know in a
[1:11:26] masterpiece but when you have a great
[1:11:28] architecture he has something in his
[1:11:30] mind
[1:11:32] and he strives towards that working to
[1:11:35] what he's painting working to what he's
[1:11:37] carving
[1:11:39] working like the great Sistine Chapel as
[1:11:42] as Michelangelo painted that great thing
[1:11:45] and and all of these men worked towards
[1:11:48] uh what they had but they had something
[1:11:51] to work with
[1:11:53] so God he when he worked with it he
[1:11:56] didn't have anything to work with if I
[1:11:59] could say that I I wish I had a better
[1:12:02] way of explaining it but so he he had to
[1:12:06] use himself
[1:12:08] so what he thought and what he created
[1:12:11] he brought it to pass and he was the
[1:12:15] author and finisher so he knew it from
[1:12:17] the end all the way to the beginning it
[1:12:20] was all thought out even to this morning
[1:12:24] what he had in mind for you
[1:12:29] and and we wanted to lay that real
[1:12:32] strong in your heart this morning that
[1:12:35] God had a has a part for you to play
[1:12:40] and I'm not complete without you playing
[1:12:43] your part and I apologize for all the
[1:12:48] times that I've let my part down
[1:12:51] because in letting my part down I let
[1:12:53] you down
[1:12:54] and we let one another down and I
[1:12:58] believe this portrait and this book of
[1:13:00] Nehemiah
[1:13:02] is a wonderful book about the church
[1:13:06] working together
[1:13:08] and everybody performing their Duty
[1:13:12] and
[1:13:14] and uh you know on the job site we have
[1:13:18] a term for people that don't do their
[1:13:23] part we call them sandbaggers or or
[1:13:27] Slackers or you know they don't carry
[1:13:30] their weight
[1:13:31] and I would notice through time that
[1:13:34] certain people they they uh
[1:13:37] they want to work with a certain person
[1:13:40] because that person carries their load
[1:13:45] you know oh we got to get this done oh
[1:13:48] let's get Kim to do it he'll get it done
[1:13:50] and and pretty soon you're packing
[1:13:52] everybody's load you know what I mean
[1:13:55] but that don't work in the kingdom of
[1:13:57] God
[1:13:59] and so when we go through the third
[1:14:02] chapter of the book of Nehemiah
[1:14:05] the the list is this group of people
[1:14:08] built this part in this group of people
[1:14:11] and and it's such a beautiful picture
[1:14:15] of everybody working together
[1:14:19] that if if had to be everybody building
[1:14:23] that their part and doing their job
[1:14:27] and everybody had to work and and it
[1:14:33] from that aspect of it
[1:14:37] each group of people and each individual
[1:14:42] took on the responsibility
[1:14:45] and by taking on the responsibility that
[1:14:49] became part of a burden that they were
[1:14:53] going to fulfill they knew what the
[1:14:58] effort that they were going to put into
[1:15:01] it so they made a commitment
[1:15:05] right from the beginning
[1:15:08] when the whole vision of building the
[1:15:12] wall was presented to them when Nehemiah
[1:15:16] came and Nehemiah had a burden on his
[1:15:20] heart and the scripture says that that
[1:15:23] that he cared for the Jews in fact they
[1:15:27] they wanted to know who's this guy that
[1:15:30] comes and is looking after the welfare
[1:15:34] of the Jews
[1:15:38] and that's kind of the theme this
[1:15:40] morning of what we're going to study uh
[1:15:43] if I if I uh
[1:15:46] had a title I would maybe call it
[1:15:49] watching in unison
[1:15:54] but it it's the care
[1:15:58] that they had and the commitment to
[1:16:02] doing uh what they said that they would
[1:16:06] do and as we read in this fourth chapter
[1:16:09] we find out that that these people they
[1:16:13] they begin to mock the Jews they begin
[1:16:15] to say oh even if they build the wall uh
[1:16:21] even if a fox walks through
[1:16:26] it'll knock it down
[1:16:28] so you know the first thing that they go
[1:16:31] through is denial
[1:16:34] you know oh it just this ain't nothing
[1:16:37] this ain't nothing but even in the
[1:16:40] scriptures when the when they talked
[1:16:43] about the high priest he said they
[1:16:45] talked to him and he commands I think it
[1:16:47] was said if
[1:16:49] it's God
[1:16:52] then with not speak against it
[1:16:55] but if it's not God it will come to not
[1:17:01] so if it's God so they had to come to a
[1:17:06] place
[1:17:07] that
[1:17:09] they believed it was God
[1:17:13] before they they could ever
[1:17:17] start out
[1:17:18] on this great project and it's good if
[1:17:22] you go back and you you nowadays I guess
[1:17:25] I'm sure that uh some of you could look
[1:17:30] there there's some photographs and
[1:17:32] things of what that wall looked like and
[1:17:35] drawings of the rubble
[1:17:37] and it was so bad that they couldn't
[1:17:41] even pass through
[1:17:42] the Rocks were so heavy and it was so
[1:17:46] beat down and the gates was
[1:17:49] burn up
[1:17:50] it looked like something that was
[1:17:54] uh insurmountable
[1:17:57] that couldn't be done
[1:18:00] impossible and I think that's what we
[1:18:03] all got to realize that what we're
[1:18:06] facing is in building this body of the
[1:18:10] Lord Jesus Christ and this body be
[1:18:13] fitting and joined together by the word
[1:18:16] of God and the restoration of the Faith
[1:18:21] of Our Fathers because that's what's
[1:18:24] promised to be restored to us our
[1:18:26] messenger came in the midst of a
[1:18:29] religious World beyond a shadow of a
[1:18:33] doubt and prove that Jesus Christ was
[1:18:36] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:18:39] that he did the same works
[1:18:44] and he made that clear
[1:18:47] and he told us that
[1:18:52] this was the age of restoration
[1:18:56] that the faith that our fathers had
[1:19:00] and the Revelation that our fathers had
[1:19:03] in other words the spirit that made our
[1:19:07] fathers what they were
[1:19:10] would be returned back to the believer
[1:19:14] in this time and to a gentile people
[1:19:18] this time
[1:19:21] that's something
[1:19:25] if I would
[1:19:27] say
[1:19:29] that's something to work towards
[1:19:33] is something to have a vision of
[1:19:36] for yourselves
[1:19:39] that each of you can look at yourself
[1:19:41] as a
[1:19:44] of as a child of faith
[1:19:49] as a early church believer
[1:19:53] the women as those that receive their
[1:19:57] their loved ones from the dead of to
[1:20:00] those that prayed and saw signs and
[1:20:03] wonders that you've got to take yourself
[1:20:06] and you've got to place yourself in that
[1:20:10] position and say I'm one of them
[1:20:15] is it okay if I take my coat off thank
[1:20:18] you
[1:20:23] thank you brother Billy
[1:20:25] and and so we find out that that in
[1:20:29] order for this project
[1:20:35] to be move forward
[1:20:39] that they had to be convinced it was God
[1:20:45] they had to believe it was
[1:20:47] the will of God and they had to say I'm
[1:20:50] going to participate in this
[1:20:56] and we talked about that a little bit
[1:20:58] before that the outsider wanted to
[1:21:01] participate
[1:21:03] and they said no you have no Heritage in
[1:21:06] this
[1:21:07] the heritage of the restoration of the
[1:21:11] Faith of Our Fathers is to the elect
[1:21:17] you say why could you say that that
[1:21:20] should be for everybody but if you're
[1:21:23] not elect you're gonna mix leaven with
[1:21:27] it
[1:21:29] um
[1:21:31] you see and they didn't want to build
[1:21:33] the wall
[1:21:35] can have all kinds of unbeliefs
[1:21:39] and all kinds of suspicions and all
[1:21:43] kinds of little uh Trinkets and little
[1:21:46] idols and little witchcraft things
[1:21:51] I remember one time in Ghana
[1:21:54] where a guy came to me and he said
[1:21:58] there's a bunch of witch doctors
[1:22:02] uh praying against you and he wanted to
[1:22:06] give me a little something could that
[1:22:09] somebody had prayed over that was going
[1:22:13] to keep
[1:22:15] those witch doctors off of me
[1:22:19] and I thought you know what
[1:22:21] if I need that I shouldn't be here
[1:22:27] but the word of God says if God sends me
[1:22:30] God will take care of me
[1:22:33] so you don't have to be afraid to be
[1:22:37] being sent
[1:22:39] amen if you're elected and chose to show
[1:22:42] this generation that the power of the
[1:22:46] Resurrection is still alive then you
[1:22:49] cannot be afraid to stand up and take
[1:22:52] that position and con and confess
[1:22:56] that you're that part of that scripture
[1:23:01] coming to pass
[1:23:04] you must recognize yourself as scripture
[1:23:09] can I say that again you are not here of
[1:23:13] your choosing
[1:23:15] you have not chosen me I have chosen you
[1:23:18] you are not here because you saw it was
[1:23:22] a good thing
[1:23:25] but you're here because God elected you
[1:23:27] to be here he chose you to be in this
[1:23:30] place at this time and he's got a reason
[1:23:34] that he's done it
[1:23:39] and you can't be ashamed you can't look
[1:23:42] at your past and say I'm disqualified
[1:23:50] he knew the beginning from the end and
[1:23:53] didn't disqualify you
[1:23:57] you can't look at the history of your
[1:24:00] mistakes
[1:24:02] you can't look at the history of your
[1:24:04] failures
[1:24:06] you can't spend your life in regret
[1:24:11] because in order to be victorious you've
[1:24:14] got to leave those things which are
[1:24:16] behind behind and press for the higher
[1:24:19] calling
[1:24:23] and in order for that group of people to
[1:24:26] work in unity
[1:24:29] third chapter is amazing
[1:24:31] but if I can't read one of these names I
[1:24:34] would surely never make it through the
[1:24:36] third chapter
[1:24:38] but it's this group built this and this
[1:24:41] group did this don't you understand in
[1:24:43] order for them to do that they had to
[1:24:46] lay their grudges beside behind
[1:24:50] they had to lay their thoughts
[1:24:53] about one another behind they had to
[1:24:56] enter into a Unity
[1:25:00] because they knew
[1:25:03] they wouldn't be able to do it without
[1:25:07] one another
[1:25:11] and we kind of get to the place a lot of
[1:25:14] times
[1:25:15] that we don't feel we're obligated
[1:25:18] to one another
[1:25:21] we use that quote it's an individual
[1:25:24] Affair so much that it's like the
[1:25:27] prophet of God we've taken Grace and
[1:25:30] made it a disgrace
[1:25:34] the affair
[1:25:37] is individual
[1:25:41] just like in a family
[1:25:45] or in a marriage
[1:25:47] but the results are brothers and sisters
[1:25:50] that live together in unity and life
[1:25:54] and love
[1:25:56] and work out their salvation with fear
[1:25:59] and trembling and they make a family
[1:26:03] so so the Affairs individual
[1:26:07] the birth is individual
[1:26:11] the the forgiveness
[1:26:14] is individual
[1:26:16] to you as an individual God forgave you
[1:26:19] your sins he didn't forgive you of my
[1:26:22] sins
[1:26:23] and because you asked for forgiveness
[1:26:26] and he forgave you doesn't allow me to
[1:26:31] say oh I did the same thing he did
[1:26:36] no I've got to go get my own forgiveness
[1:26:38] I've got to accept my own pardon I've
[1:26:42] got to ask him for my own birth but once
[1:26:45] I've had that birth I've been borned
[1:26:47] into the body of the Living God
[1:26:53] and now I'm a part of something
[1:26:57] you just can't say well I'm not part of
[1:26:59] the body
[1:27:01] well then you won't be
[1:27:05] and there's the body that's going to be
[1:27:07] Resurrected
[1:27:09] you're not the only person going in the
[1:27:12] resurrection
[1:27:13] but you have to think if there's only
[1:27:17] one it's me
[1:27:19] but you don't pray oh Lord let it be me
[1:27:23] and forget everybody else if there's
[1:27:25] only one Let It Be Me Lord
[1:27:29] no Lord I want everyone
[1:27:32] that I love and loves me there
[1:27:37] so we begin to see that there there had
[1:27:40] to be a transformation
[1:27:44] and I think it's to our shame
[1:27:47] that we have such a great message
[1:27:50] and such a great messenger
[1:27:53] that spoke such Words of Love out to a
[1:27:57] people that didn't even see what he was
[1:28:00] know what he was or believe what he was
[1:28:05] even though they reap the benefits
[1:28:09] of his spirit
[1:28:12] to have division
[1:28:15] Among Us
[1:28:21] but that's man's nature
[1:28:24] and a kingdom cannot survive if it's
[1:28:28] divided against itself
[1:28:31] if we could all just come to the place
[1:28:35] that we had an absolute
[1:28:39] that we can leave our own
[1:28:41] interpretations and our own ideas and in
[1:28:46] our ownings and really from the
[1:28:48] sincereness of our heart ask God to
[1:28:52] reveal to us what was the messenger
[1:28:56] trying to tell me
[1:29:01] because it's not secondhand
[1:29:06] he wrote the message to you where you
[1:29:09] are
[1:29:10] you says I'm 19 yes there's a 19 year
[1:29:14] old message in there
[1:29:16] that'll touch you well I'm only there's
[1:29:18] a 12 year old message
[1:29:21] there's I don't care how low you can go
[1:29:25] Faith cometh by hearing
[1:29:27] never was a quote on the end of it if
[1:29:30] you're so old you're so old if you don't
[1:29:33] start taking it personal right
[1:29:35] and you don't start letting it work on
[1:29:38] you and you don't start letting it speak
[1:29:40] to you
[1:29:43] then you're gonna find yourself
[1:29:46] short of things
[1:29:50] that you could have possessed
[1:29:55] so there's such a uh of Fountain
[1:30:00] of blessings
[1:30:02] to the believer
[1:30:05] such a fountain of blessings so no
[1:30:07] matter where you are in your life that
[1:30:10] will guide you and and instruct you uh
[1:30:14] and and teach you for all scripture is
[1:30:17] given for instruction for reproof for
[1:30:20] living in godliness
[1:30:23] and if you don't connect with it
[1:30:27] and don't say wait a minute there's
[1:30:30] something in here for me because I'm a
[1:30:34] part
[1:30:36] of what God's doing
[1:30:39] I'm a part of the move the move that
[1:30:42] God's making
[1:30:45] or else you're just sitting back
[1:30:49] and you're seeing where things go
[1:30:52] it's like standing outside of a bus
[1:30:57] and reading the sign where it's going
[1:31:02] and then when it leaves
[1:31:04] you're not on it
[1:31:09] work out your own salvations
[1:31:12] with fear and trembling
[1:31:14] it doesn't say
[1:31:16] it said work it out
[1:31:19] you gotta work your way through being
[1:31:22] 12.
[1:31:23] you've got to work your way through
[1:31:25] being 15 and 16. you've got to work your
[1:31:29] way through your parents not knowing
[1:31:31] everything you've got to work your way
[1:31:33] through you feel like oh they just got
[1:31:35] control of me I don't have no Freedom
[1:31:38] you've got to work your way through your
[1:31:40] siblings
[1:31:46] but you gotta you gotta have a goal
[1:31:50] so as we looked and read these
[1:31:52] scriptures we're going to find out that
[1:31:55] there were certain characteristics
[1:31:59] that every
[1:32:01] wall Builder
[1:32:04] and gate Builder had to have
[1:32:08] and those characteristics I found
[1:32:12] so beautifully spoken by our messenger
[1:32:17] he said one of the first things they had
[1:32:20] to be is they had to be persistent
[1:32:27] okay and
[1:32:29] I want to read a few statements that
[1:32:32] before we go through
[1:32:34] uh
[1:32:35] these scriptures
[1:32:39] if I could
[1:32:45] I want to talk a little bit about the
[1:32:48] characteristic
[1:32:50] of perseverance
[1:32:53] and
[1:32:55] and it's uh
[1:32:57] it's a marvelous characteristic
[1:33:01] and and there's a thing that motivates
[1:33:04] perseverance
[1:33:06] how many you understand what
[1:33:08] perseverance means that means to stick
[1:33:11] with something just stay after it to go
[1:33:15] after it not to let nothing Knock You
[1:33:19] Down
[1:33:20] so we find out in this thing when these
[1:33:23] guys begin to speak all these words
[1:33:26] against them all who do they think they
[1:33:29] are these feeble Jews this little group
[1:33:32] of people and they're going to build the
[1:33:35] wall they're going to stand against the
[1:33:37] king mocking them and everything I love
[1:33:40] the response of Nehemiah and that's the
[1:33:44] fourth verse he says Hear o our God
[1:33:51] for we are despised
[1:33:54] and turn their reproach upon their own
[1:33:57] head
[1:34:00] we've got to stop giving the devil a
[1:34:03] pass
[1:34:06] we got to start identifying me as the
[1:34:09] devil we've got to start telling me he
[1:34:12] don't belong he's not going to squat
[1:34:14] this is our city this are our walls
[1:34:17] these are our gates
[1:34:19] and get behind me
[1:34:22] he said upon their own head and give
[1:34:26] them for pray into the land of captivity
[1:34:33] in other words they want to put us under
[1:34:35] their hand Lord let them all come and
[1:34:38] Capt them may they become prey
[1:34:45] you know we give way too much place
[1:34:50] to things that aren't God
[1:34:55] and as I read some of these statements I
[1:34:59] hope that you will see that
[1:35:03] what and I I uh if you know like they
[1:35:08] accuse Paul in the second Corinthians
[1:35:12] the 10th chapter of writing real strong
[1:35:15] letters but yet being weak and comparing
[1:35:19] them and and trying to tear down and
[1:35:21] Paul just trying to say hey I'm just
[1:35:23] telling you the word
[1:35:24] you know what I mean because the words
[1:35:26] the only thing that's going to benefit
[1:35:28] you and he says they're fools because
[1:35:31] they compare themselves one to another
[1:35:33] and and and and and they have a whole
[1:35:37] different way of measuring we only
[1:35:39] measure everything by God's word
[1:35:42] so this is what the prophet of God said
[1:35:44] in the one of the messages perseverance
[1:35:49] this happens to be the one that he
[1:35:52] preached in
[1:35:54] 1963 uh
[1:35:57] 0-1 13 in the evening
[1:36:02] in paragraph 34
[1:36:04] he speaks
[1:36:06] this
[1:36:08] he says the word perseverance
[1:36:11] means to be I think according to Webster
[1:36:15] persistent
[1:36:19] in other words not hit and miss
[1:36:22] not try one day
[1:36:26] I had a a lot of fun yesterday with the
[1:36:29] brothers
[1:36:31] uh Brother Joseph told me he wanted to
[1:36:35] be a landscaper
[1:36:39] did you want to be a landscaper so I
[1:36:41] gave him a post hole digger
[1:36:45] I said dig this hole 24 inches and give
[1:36:49] this whole dig this hole 36 inches and
[1:36:54] he was out there and he just sweating
[1:36:55] away and working at it and and
[1:36:58] everything and when he finally got all
[1:37:01] done with everything he looked at me and
[1:37:05] he says I don't think I want to be a
[1:37:07] landscaper
[1:37:12] oh he says I think I'm going to look for
[1:37:14] an office job
[1:37:20] I thought okay
[1:37:24] I get it
[1:37:26] that's why I had you dig the post and
[1:37:28] not me
[1:37:31] and I appreciated him digging it you did
[1:37:34] a wonderful job
[1:37:35] but he learned something
[1:37:38] you're going to be a landscaper
[1:37:40] there's a lot of digging
[1:37:43] there's a lot of
[1:37:45] it takes a lot of persistence
[1:37:48] to see it all the way through
[1:37:52] you've got to have such a love for it
[1:37:54] and it just can't be an idea
[1:37:57] it's got to be a passion
[1:38:00] and to be a Christian you have to have a
[1:38:03] passion for Christ you have to have a
[1:38:06] passion for what the word stands for you
[1:38:09] have to have a passion for the lifestyle
[1:38:11] a passion for the spirit of passion for
[1:38:15] the blessings that come with it you
[1:38:18] can't be sharing that passion it's got
[1:38:20] to be a love affair where you're on fire
[1:38:23] I love it I want it I want to pursue it
[1:38:26] I'm going to stick with it till I get
[1:38:29] every benefit from it
[1:38:33] it can't be oh it seemed like a good
[1:38:35] idea for a while
[1:38:40] an old Ben coming up to me he says it
[1:38:42] looks to me like you're making careers
[1:38:45] I said none of them are Labor careers
[1:38:47] and none of them are in construction
[1:38:50] I can tell you that
[1:38:54] you've got to be persistent
[1:38:58] I don't know if you found that let us
[1:39:01] read on
[1:39:03] he says
[1:39:05] I think according to Webster it means
[1:39:07] to be persevering
[1:39:12] perseverant in making a goal
[1:39:16] and every person on Earth
[1:39:19] or that ever been on Earth that ever
[1:39:22] achieved anything or amounted to
[1:39:25] anything had to be perseverant
[1:39:31] so I want you to think these people had
[1:39:33] to take on
[1:39:35] the commitment
[1:39:37] that I'm going to see this thing through
[1:39:40] to the end
[1:39:44] and when the enemy came up
[1:39:48] and begin to mock them
[1:39:52] they were so persistent
[1:39:55] in what their goal was and what they
[1:39:58] wanted to achieve they called on God
[1:40:03] to fight their enemy
[1:40:06] and they go on to say and cover not
[1:40:09] their iniquity
[1:40:12] what is Iniquity
[1:40:14] unbelief
[1:40:17] cover not the iniquity that they don't
[1:40:20] believe this is God that they don't
[1:40:22] believe what we're doing we're told to
[1:40:25] do
[1:40:25] don't let that just go away don't let
[1:40:29] them remind them keep them in mind you
[1:40:32] stood against it
[1:40:36] you spoke against it
[1:40:39] you reviled it and let me tell you
[1:40:42] something there's going to be a lot of
[1:40:44] people that reviled this message reviled
[1:40:47] the people in it
[1:40:49] for their own movement
[1:40:52] and their iniquity will not be hid as
[1:40:56] one brother told me he said I'm still
[1:40:58] waiting for their apology I say Amen
[1:41:04] people just change courses
[1:41:11] I had a man come to me in bald face lie
[1:41:14] to me
[1:41:16] and then get out and put out a big thing
[1:41:19] and try to cover it up
[1:41:24] Lord let not his iniquity
[1:41:29] sorry I had to get that off my heart
[1:41:34] he said Terry
[1:41:36] Our God for We Are
[1:41:37] advised and from
[1:41:40] turn their reproach upon their own head
[1:41:44] I like that right and cover not their
[1:41:47] iniquity and let not their sin be
[1:41:50] blotted out from before thee for they
[1:41:54] have provoked thee to anger before the
[1:41:58] builders
[1:42:00] Hallelujah
[1:42:03] that's part of persistence
[1:42:06] you can't let every critic
[1:42:09] you can't let everybody that got an
[1:42:12] opinion you can't let everybody push you
[1:42:15] away from your passion
[1:42:19] God put something on your heart
[1:42:23] it's not majority rules
[1:42:26] you and God make a majority if you feel
[1:42:30] led to do something you stick with it
[1:42:34] you pray about it you know of God before
[1:42:36] you who can be against you but I'm
[1:42:40] telling you if we're going to turn in
[1:42:43] to this manifested bride that we're
[1:42:46] prophesied to be with a spirit of love
[1:42:50] being shed abroad in our heart not the
[1:42:52] spirit of power the spirit of love
[1:42:55] because if you've got love power will
[1:42:57] follow we're trying to get the power
[1:43:00] before the love and we're going to have
[1:43:02] a mess on our hands
[1:43:06] we're going to have a lot of confused
[1:43:08] young people we're going to have a lot
[1:43:10] of disappointed people
[1:43:14] gets a passion for Christ first
[1:43:19] power without character
[1:43:23] is satanic
[1:43:27] you don't put a gun in the hand of a
[1:43:30] minor
[1:43:32] and may I say this I don't care if I
[1:43:35] come under Crypt because I know where I
[1:43:37] stand
[1:43:38] you can't put all figure putting all the
[1:43:40] power of the spirit of God and the
[1:43:44] wisdom of the Gospel in the hands of a
[1:43:47] bunch of teenagers and think it's going
[1:43:49] to come up let them grow into it
[1:43:54] lead of the spirit growed in the word
[1:44:04] it's easy to get excited
[1:44:11] but when you have
[1:44:13] a demon in front of you
[1:44:16] you got to know there's something inside
[1:44:18] of you that he who is in you is greater
[1:44:22] than he who is in the world you better
[1:44:25] have something that's real not something
[1:44:27] that's been felt but something that's
[1:44:30] been born in you
[1:44:33] we gotta quit being babies
[1:44:38] we heard a message beautiful about
[1:44:41] letting off the pressure
[1:44:43] so perfect for our day he said where do
[1:44:46] we run when the pressure gets on we run
[1:44:48] to Christ
[1:44:50] we run to him
[1:44:52] let's read as we read this is I hope it
[1:44:56] trusts it blesses you this is our
[1:44:58] messenger speaking to us
[1:45:02] this is God speaking to us
[1:45:05] through a prophet he knew he wouldn't be
[1:45:09] here for the Divine wisdom and by divine
[1:45:12] revelation
[1:45:14] he stored it up in a storehouse
[1:45:17] that the bride can go to it and be able
[1:45:20] to retrieve it in season
[1:45:24] and have it ministered to her
[1:45:27] the life
[1:45:29] that it needed for the hour that they're
[1:45:32] in
[1:45:34] that's God
[1:45:36] that scripture
[1:45:38] that's life
[1:45:46] to be perseverant you've got to be sure
[1:45:50] first
[1:45:52] what you've got your faith Anchored In
[1:45:57] now Faith is just not a thing
[1:46:00] that so easily floated around
[1:46:05] and some kind of as we call it in Street
[1:46:08] expression Hocus Pocus
[1:46:12] faith can only have its right position
[1:46:15] when it's placed upon something that's
[1:46:19] steadfast
[1:46:25] not something that just floating around
[1:46:28] it's got to be something that's real
[1:46:30] something that's steadfast
[1:46:33] I wonder how many of them Builders
[1:46:35] looked at all that bunch of rocks and
[1:46:37] said one there was a time
[1:46:41] that a great City sat here
[1:46:43] with a great king
[1:46:46] and I'm part of that
[1:46:49] it's a land of my fathers
[1:46:53] my fathers used to live how can I be
[1:46:56] happy when the house of my father lays
[1:47:00] in ruin how can we be happy when the
[1:47:03] Church of the Living God is laying in
[1:47:06] ruin
[1:47:07] yeah
[1:47:10] we'd be happy with a half experience
[1:47:18] with a half cup of water
[1:47:21] when he promised to us
[1:47:25] so many blessings
[1:47:29] I love singing about it
[1:47:31] but I want to get to the place Lord I
[1:47:34] don't want to just sing about it I don't
[1:47:36] want to have the song feel me good I
[1:47:38] want it to become a living fountain on
[1:47:41] the inside of me I want it to be life
[1:47:44] and life abundant
[1:47:49] and I'm going to be persistent
[1:47:54] and I have a lot of unbelief to overcome
[1:47:57] I have a lot of my nature to overcome I
[1:47:59] have a lot of my personality over to
[1:48:01] come I have a lot of shortcomings but
[1:48:04] let me tell you something nothing is
[1:48:06] impossible for our God
[1:48:09] I'm not impossible for God
[1:48:14] if you don't have a passion for it
[1:48:19] if you got a taste for the world and the
[1:48:21] things of the world the scripture says
[1:48:23] the love of God isn't even in you
[1:48:26] Lord help me
[1:48:38] he says this the 37th his faith cometh
[1:48:41] by hearing and hearing what the word of
[1:48:44] God
[1:48:45] therefore
[1:48:47] if this be the word of God now he's
[1:48:50] talking about perseverance here he's
[1:48:52] going to explain to you
[1:48:55] and to me
[1:48:58] what motivates
[1:49:00] perseverance
[1:49:05] because if it's if it's not steadfast
[1:49:09] and it's not true
[1:49:12] and you don't feel
[1:49:14] that it's accomplishable
[1:49:18] you'll give up on it
[1:49:25] you'll give up
[1:49:29] the pressure will make you give up the
[1:49:31] trial will make you give up
[1:49:34] what people think will make you give up
[1:49:37] your past will make you give up
[1:49:45] nobody that ever gave up ever persevered
[1:49:51] you've got to persevere
[1:49:58] I'll try to give probably got a little
[1:50:01] bit of time this morning but
[1:50:04] I think it's
[1:50:07] he says therefore if it
[1:50:09] if this be the word of God
[1:50:12] and it is
[1:50:14] what it teaches we can rest upon it
[1:50:19] God cannot change
[1:50:22] God must forever remain God his word
[1:50:27] must be just as true in this age as it
[1:50:31] ever was in any age
[1:50:37] we are finite we can say something this
[1:50:41] year and maybe even tomorrow have to
[1:50:45] alter it because we're not too sure
[1:50:49] because we're finite
[1:50:52] we just presume
[1:50:55] and presume means to venture without
[1:50:58] Authority
[1:51:02] boy I got that disease bad
[1:51:06] there's only one cure for it
[1:51:08] the word of God
[1:51:11] listen as God speaks to us
[1:51:14] but when God says something it's
[1:51:17] perfect
[1:51:19] don't eat altering don't need changing e
[1:51:22] means exactly what he says he means
[1:51:24] right it's perfect he don't have to
[1:51:28] alter it Abraham staggered nodded the
[1:51:31] promise of God through unbelief
[1:51:34] but was strong giving praise to God
[1:51:37] because he knows that he was able to
[1:51:41] perform or to keep or to do that what he
[1:51:46] had promised
[1:51:49] then if God is ever called on the scene
[1:51:52] for a decision
[1:51:54] and the decision that God makes first it
[1:51:58] has to Forever remain the same if he
[1:52:02] forgave the woman at the well he'll have
[1:52:05] to forgive every woman at the well
[1:52:09] if he forgave the woman caught in
[1:52:11] adultery he'd have to forgive every
[1:52:13] woman caught in adultery
[1:52:17] if he cast out the devil he'd have to
[1:52:20] cast out every devil
[1:52:24] as long as you come to him on the same
[1:52:27] grounds and the same decision
[1:52:32] and you identify yourself Lord I'm like
[1:52:35] that man
[1:52:37] and he came to you and you forgive him
[1:52:40] therefore I can have confidence
[1:52:45] that you'll forgive me therefore I'm
[1:52:48] going to be persistent
[1:52:51] till I get the blessing
[1:52:54] that's mine
[1:52:58] we're not going to go anywhere
[1:53:01] without it
[1:53:04] this is what motivates it
[1:53:10] he said
[1:53:12] if God ever called LeBron to make a
[1:53:14] decision that promise
[1:53:16] that God makes first it has to Forever
[1:53:19] remain the same it can never change it
[1:53:23] cannot be altered because he's infinite
[1:53:26] in anything that's infinite never had a
[1:53:29] beginning or an end so he can't take it
[1:53:33] back next year or say it was wrong
[1:53:38] and then if that was his decision then
[1:53:42] every man that makes the same
[1:53:45] comes to the same decision that God made
[1:53:48] for one man upon the basis of his faith
[1:53:52] to believe it he's got to meet that same
[1:53:56] thing every time a man believes it
[1:54:00] oh
[1:54:01] God
[1:54:03] let that sink in
[1:54:08] you're really not as special as you
[1:54:11] think you are
[1:54:16] you want scripture for that God is no
[1:54:19] respecter
[1:54:21] a person
[1:54:25] a prophet
[1:54:31] what life
[1:54:33] he's trying to restore back this people
[1:54:39] this city
[1:54:40] this Jerusalem
[1:54:47] he's got to meet the same thing every
[1:54:50] time a man believes it God has got to
[1:54:54] act every time the way he acted the
[1:54:57] first time
[1:54:58] he acted wrong the first time who can
[1:55:02] accuse God of acting wrong God has got
[1:55:06] to every remain with his decision
[1:55:13] if thou canest believe
[1:55:16] now to achieve anything
[1:55:19] you've got to set a goal and say
[1:55:29] this I believe
[1:55:37] you know Satan's knocked me down a lot
[1:55:42] he's knocked me down mentally he's
[1:55:44] knocked me down physically he's knocked
[1:55:47] me down emotionally
[1:55:49] he's I've
[1:55:51] wanted to quit over and over and over
[1:55:56] again but there's one thing I believe
[1:56:00] this message
[1:56:03] so I might not understand it
[1:56:06] I might not have a a hundredth of what's
[1:56:09] in it but I know by divine revelation
[1:56:13] that God's Prophet for this age was
[1:56:16] William Miriam Branham he was a
[1:56:18] Vindicated word of God he was
[1:56:20] scripturally Vindicated it was the word
[1:56:23] of God made manifest through our day and
[1:56:26] I believe it
[1:56:29] I cannot help that
[1:56:35] am I discouraged what I see in the
[1:56:38] mirror
[1:56:39] yes
[1:56:41] but when I hear what he just said
[1:56:45] then I know like every lost man if I
[1:56:48] could go meet him on that ground he'll
[1:56:51] transform me into what that he has in
[1:56:54] mind for me
[1:57:03] you've got to set it goal
[1:57:07] this I believe
[1:57:09] and tie yourself to it
[1:57:17] too many anchors
[1:57:19] in too many things
[1:57:22] and keep drawing
[1:57:29] move up closer to it
[1:57:35] how many of us are standing off
[1:57:39] we're not moving into that perfect man
[1:57:41] we're not trying to move into that Faith
[1:57:43] we're not trying to accept the public
[1:57:46] responsibility and the power that God
[1:57:49] wants to transmit to us don't overcome
[1:57:52] our whole life is standoffish
[1:57:59] we don't want to go into the prayer
[1:58:00] closet you know I I get afraid to go in
[1:58:03] my prayer closet because I'm afraid God
[1:58:05] will tell me something I don't want to
[1:58:06] hear
[1:58:13] oh you like getting my prayer on God
[1:58:15] said Brother David I'd like you to go
[1:58:16] down

[1:58:40] will when you're not standoffish anymore

[1:58:46] go through with this I'm going to be
[1:58:48] persistent in it Lord if that's what
[1:58:50] your hearts desire for me but you can't
[1:58:52] be standoffish you got to tie yourself
[1:58:54] to it you got to pull draw to it what's

[1:59:47] what are you coming to as a Christian

[1:59:54] of the man you're walking into
[1:59:57] your personality your characteristics
[2:00:00] your traits
[2:00:02] overcoming your weakness
[2:00:10] I don't like who I am
[2:00:15] but praise God
[2:00:18] he can change me
[2:00:22] if I draw to this message if I know
[2:00:25] there's something in there for for me if
[2:00:28] I know I'm coming to something I'm
[2:00:31] coming to a gentler man I'm coming to
[2:00:34] more of a wise man I'm coming to a
[2:00:37] Kinder man I'm coming to a man that
[2:00:39] cares more I want to come to the place
[2:00:42] that I can identify with the sick
[2:00:44] that I can take their burden
[2:00:49] no I'm not what I want to be
[2:00:52] and I'm not what I ought to be but by
[2:00:55] his grace I'm not what I used to be
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:01:00] and I'm moving up
[2:01:05] are you moving up this morning

[2:01:15] promised to become is it your promise
[2:01:18] are you persistent to it do you know
[2:01:21] what the messenger said he said that you
[2:01:24] are the last sign that the world would
[2:01:26] get is Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:01:29] and Christ in you is the hope of other
[2:01:32] men
[2:01:37] you got to know it's there
[2:01:42] I like this little thing
[2:01:45] he says like it it was said
[2:01:48] the little boy with the kite
[2:01:51] holding the string in his hands
[2:01:54] and he said the man said what are you
[2:01:57] holding son
[2:01:59] he said my kite
[2:02:03] he said I don't see nothing but string
[2:02:07] he said but there's a kite on the end of
[2:02:10] it
[2:02:11] the man looked up and said I don't see
[2:02:14] the kite
[2:02:15] the little boy said neither do I
[2:02:18] he said well how do you know you've got
[2:02:21] a kite he said I can feel it tugging at
[2:02:24] the end Hallelujah I feel something
[2:02:28] tugging me
[2:02:32] to be a perfect Christian to be a
[2:02:35] perfect man to meet Satan at every
[2:02:37] ground every incident to stand up
[2:02:44] I gotta be persistent
[2:02:47] that's a characteristic
[2:02:50] that they had
[2:02:52] and that summed up in the sixth verse
[2:02:56] so built we the wall
[2:02:59] and all the wall joined together
[2:03:02] unto the half thereof for the people had
[2:03:06] a mind
[2:03:08] to work
[2:03:10] they were persistent
[2:03:13] half the walls built now it's finally
[2:03:16] all hooked together
[2:03:19] and then
[2:03:20] I'll skip over these next few verses
[2:03:23] but what so what happened is they all
[2:03:26] conspired
[2:03:28] they were Roth and they all got together
[2:03:30] and they conspired
[2:03:33] to go against
[2:03:36] them
[2:03:40] and all can atheros and and conspired
[2:03:43] all of them together to come and to
[2:03:46] fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it
[2:03:54] right

[2:03:59] without a battle

[2:06:37] night because of them
[2:06:42] now you know what comes next
[2:06:48] you've got to if you're persevering and
[2:06:51] you believe it then you become concerned
[2:06:55] if you're convinced you're concerned
[2:06:59] if you're convinced that there's an
[2:07:03] enemy trying to devour your children
[2:07:05] trying to devour your friends trying to
[2:07:09] devour this life this Christianity
[2:07:12] they're trying to devour this message
[2:07:18] trying to make it illegal for us to
[2:07:20] preach against
[2:07:22] homosexuality and act and making us
[2:07:26] accept
[2:07:29] transgender
[2:07:32] things
[2:07:35] not going to do it
[2:07:37] it's Antichrist it's anti-word it's not
[2:07:42] scriptural
[2:07:44] and God will fight our battle
[2:07:48] if God be for you who can be against you
[2:07:54] why try to be politically correct
[2:07:59] when how much have they changed politics
[2:08:02] in five years or four years or two years
[2:08:05] don't build yourself on something that
[2:08:08] don't last
[2:08:10] he said never left our prayers under our
[2:08:13] God and we set watch against them day
[2:08:14] and night because of them
[2:08:16] and Judah said the strength of the Bears
[2:08:19] of burden is decayed
[2:08:22] and there is much Rubble
[2:08:25] so that we are not able to build the
[2:08:28] wall
[2:08:31] and our advisor said
[2:08:34] they shall not know neither in our
[2:08:37] adversaries
[2:08:38] said
[2:08:43] they shall not know neither see till we
[2:08:48] come in the midst among them and slay
[2:08:52] them and cause the work
[2:08:55] disease
[2:08:58] when I read that I thought in my Heart
[2:09:00] Lord how much Rubble
[2:09:02] do I have in my life
[2:09:07] how much Rubble is there that's keeping
[2:09:10] me from seeing the enemy
[2:09:15] how much tell me this he said I can't
[2:09:18] work
[2:09:20] got so much Rubble so much junk
[2:09:24] so many burdens and things of the world
[2:09:27] that I'm totally absorbed with that I
[2:09:30] can't even work for the kingdom of God I
[2:09:33] can't have faith I can't have an
[2:09:35] atmosphere I can't have any Joy because
[2:09:38] I'm stuck in a pile of rubble
[2:09:45] in the adversary
[2:09:50] can sneak in
[2:09:52] and stop the work
[2:10:00] I like
[2:10:02] what they said they they're gonna do
[2:10:05] I just want you to catch this whole
[2:10:07] beautiful thing that that
[2:10:10] they're they're saying and he said so
[2:10:15] they set up a watch
[2:10:20] they begin to look out after one another
[2:10:24] they begin to become concerned about one
[2:10:27] another
[2:10:30] they were convinced and concerned they
[2:10:33] cared about one another
[2:10:36] it was their City
[2:10:40] when people ask you you don't go to my
[2:10:43] church
[2:10:46] don't tell people you go to David
[2:10:49] McGarry's Church please don't
[2:10:54] tell them you come to you go to
[2:10:55] Christian Life Tabernacle
[2:10:58] if they say who's the pastor you say I'm
[2:11:01] trusting it's the Holy Ghost
[2:11:04] because I sure hope that guy there gets
[2:11:06] out of the way
[2:11:10] all the glory to our Lord
[2:11:13] [Applause]
[2:11:17] are we convinced it's God
[2:11:22] hmm
[2:11:25] I mean you are you convinced there's
[2:11:28] there's a God working here with you
[2:11:33] is it just another church
[2:11:39] you know are we a denomination we go
[2:11:41] hither we can go whatever as long as
[2:11:44] they're preaching the message great I'll
[2:11:46] give you a letter
[2:11:51] I know good that dude but
[2:11:54] some people
[2:11:55] want them
[2:11:59] our adversary said we shall not know
[2:12:03] so there's too much junk
[2:12:07] and the junk was hindering them to besee
[2:12:11] the enemy
[2:12:13] now that's what I said watching in
[2:12:16] unison
[2:12:18] as we read this next
[2:12:22] portion of scripture these people all of
[2:12:25] a sudden realize there's Spirits out
[2:12:28] there
[2:12:29] that are trying to bring the work of
[2:12:32] this message which is to have a bride
[2:12:36] with the love of God shed a bride in
[2:12:39] their heart being capped with the
[2:12:43] Capstone
[2:12:46] and there's people that are pursuing
[2:12:49] that
[2:12:51] the love of God
[2:12:53] shed abroad in their heart by the holy
[2:12:56] spirit so they had to do certain things
[2:12:59] and we're going to have to do certain
[2:13:02] things we are going to have to start
[2:13:04] looking out after one another
[2:13:09] being in prayer one for another being
[2:13:12] concerned about one another
[2:13:18] it's not a one-man job
[2:13:22] that's the curse of nickelodeonism
[2:13:25] the pastor's supposed to pray for the
[2:13:27] sick I can't pray for all the sick
[2:13:31] sometimes I'm sick myself
[2:13:36] you've got to pray for the sick
[2:13:39] you've got to look after one another
[2:13:47] look
[2:13:49] older sisters are to teach the younger
[2:13:52] sisters
[2:13:58] you're an uplift one another in prayer
[2:14:02] you've got to get fitted and joined
[2:14:04] together
[2:14:06] you can't sit apart you've got to join
[2:14:09] the watch
[2:14:14] you've got to join the watch you've got
[2:14:17] to join the fight you can't always have
[2:14:21] a back door
[2:14:22] you can't always have an Escape Plan
[2:14:27] you've got to be convinced you've got to
[2:14:30] be committed you've got to know where
[2:14:33] you stand
[2:14:35] and they go on they said he said
[2:14:39] he says and then it came to pass that
[2:14:42] when the Jews which dwelt by them came
[2:14:46] they send and said unto us ten times
[2:14:50] from all places when she shall return
[2:14:53] unto us they will be upon you
[2:14:58] know there's anything
[2:15:00] they're going to get you
[2:15:02] they're everywhere
[2:15:04] there's no safe route
[2:15:09] so these guys say okay we got to get
[2:15:11] involved we've got to do something we
[2:15:14] got to protect ourselves
[2:15:16] we try to have a prayer meeting this
[2:15:18] Tuesday is going to be a prayer meeting
[2:15:23] all might take a little sacrifice
[2:15:26] to come pray for somebody
[2:15:31] we've got Soul soft
[2:15:35] it's pathetic
[2:15:38] excuse that word
[2:15:42] I'm not saying you're soft I'm saying we
[2:15:45] need to get stronger
[2:15:46] is that better
[2:15:49] no I don't want you to be under
[2:15:51] conviction
[2:15:54] but I want you to be encouraged
[2:16:01] so it came to pass can't I there will be
[2:16:03] upon you therefore I set I in the lower
[2:16:07] place behind the wall
[2:16:09] and on the higher places I even set the
[2:16:13] people after their families with their
[2:16:17] swords their Spears and their bows
[2:16:26] our weapons of warfare are not carnal
[2:16:31] but they're spiritual and mighty and
[2:16:34] pulling down of the strongholds
[2:16:38] I believe that's
[2:16:40] the second Corinthians 10 and
[2:16:46] four I believe
[2:16:50] you want to you can throw it up there if
[2:16:52] you like if you find that
[2:16:55] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[2:16:58] carnal
[2:17:00] But Mighty through God
[2:17:03] to the pulling down of strongholds amen
[2:17:09] we got a spiritual weapon
[2:17:13] and then he goes let's read on it's
[2:17:14] beautiful
[2:17:16] he says
[2:17:17] from all places when she shall return
[2:17:19] and therefore I sit in the lower Tower
[2:17:21] of pace behind the wall and on the
[2:17:23] higher places I set the people after
[2:17:26] their families with their swords their
[2:17:29] Spears and their bows
[2:17:32] and I looked and Rose up and said unto
[2:17:35] the Nobles and to the rulers and to the
[2:17:38] rest of the people be not afraid of them
[2:17:42] amen remember the Lord
[2:17:45] which is great and terrible
[2:17:48] and fight for your brethren
[2:17:52] your sons your daughters your wives and
[2:17:57] your house Hallelujah
[2:18:02] not just for yourself fight for your
[2:18:05] brethren fight for your loved ones to
[2:18:09] fight fight for your sons fight for your
[2:18:12] daughters fight for your wives fight for
[2:18:14] your house
[2:18:21] watching in unison
[2:18:24] watching after one another keep fighting
[2:18:27] for one another what's our ours is a
[2:18:30] spiritual warfare pulling down the
[2:18:33] strongholds when we see the enemy
[2:18:35] creeping in with a flood you go to your
[2:18:38] brother you talk to your brother you got
[2:18:40] you can't just sit back and say oh well
[2:18:42] that's not my business
[2:18:46] whose testimony was that
[2:18:51] I'm Not My Brother's Keeper
[2:18:58] we are our Brother's Keeper
[2:19:01] we're the keepers of the faith
[2:19:04] the scripture tells us when one be
[2:19:06] caught in a fall ye that are strong go
[2:19:09] to that person and lift them up
[2:19:16] pray for them
[2:19:18] get involved with them don't keep
[2:19:20] brushing everything off you might be the
[2:19:23] only eyes on it
[2:19:31] you might be the only one that noticed
[2:19:33] somebody slipping away
[2:19:37] you might be the only one that that sees
[2:19:42] a thought
[2:19:43] of gossip
[2:19:45] running through the house
[2:19:48] of the Living God
[2:19:51] you've got to stand there and say wait a
[2:19:53] minute
[2:19:54] I'm not going to let this hurt my family
[2:19:57] I'm not going to let this hide in the
[2:19:59] rubble
[2:20:03] I'm not going to do it I'm I'm in a
[2:20:05] fight for my brethren
[2:20:07] I'm gonna fight for my family I'm gonna
[2:20:09] fight I'm going to be a watch they set
[2:20:12] up and they took watch
[2:20:15] they were watching in unison for any
[2:20:19] place the enemy was going to come in and
[2:20:22] try to stop them from the work
[2:20:25] you say what's our work our work has a
[2:20:30] body and as individuals is to come into
[2:20:33] the image of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:20:37] Christ
[2:20:39] and to be filled with his spirit
[2:20:42] they had to fight
[2:20:46] and he said Remember the Lord and it
[2:20:49] came to pass when our enemies heard
[2:20:52] it was known unto us and God hath
[2:20:56] brought their counsel to not that we
[2:20:59] returned all of us to the wall everyone
[2:21:04] unto his work
[2:21:07] you know sometimes we only get riled up
[2:21:09] when there's
[2:21:11] a trial
[2:21:17] but he said they they stayed that off
[2:21:22] and they returned to the work
[2:21:25] Now watch how they continue
[2:21:28] and it came to pass from that time forth
[2:21:32] that half of my servants wrath in the
[2:21:35] work
[2:21:36] and the other half held both the spear
[2:21:39] and the shield and the bow
[2:21:42] and their
[2:21:44] and the
[2:21:48] harvickson's and the rulers were behind
[2:21:52] all the house of Judah
[2:21:55] and they which built on the wall and
[2:21:58] they that bear burdens with those
[2:22:02] that Laden everyone
[2:22:05] with one of his hands wrath in the work
[2:22:08] and with the other Hands Held a weapon
[2:22:14] Oh what a beautiful picture they're all
[2:22:17] working why they're perseverant they're
[2:22:20] going to build this wall they're going
[2:22:23] to build this by they're working in
[2:22:25] unison and now they realize in order for
[2:22:28] us to succeed we've got to watch out
[2:22:30] after one another we've got to put on
[2:22:33] the full armor of God
[2:22:36] foreign
[2:22:37] we've got to take the sword of the word
[2:22:40] we've got to look out and make sure the
[2:22:43] enemy isn't coming into our midst and
[2:22:47] they said for every Builder everyone had
[2:22:49] a sword amen what's his sword Hallelujah
[2:22:57] he had a sword and he had Works show me
[2:23:01] your faith without your works and I'll
[2:23:03] show you my faith by my work belief
[2:23:06] doesn't Stand Alone the word if you're
[2:23:09] going to be in the work you've got your
[2:23:12] word and you got your work
[2:23:16] and everybody's got their work and that
[2:23:19] becomes the strength
[2:23:21] of the body theology is not the strength
[2:23:25] of the body Doctrine is not the strength
[2:23:29] of the body
[2:23:30] because that can become dead but the
[2:23:33] Life of Christ working through you in
[2:23:36] good works is the strength of the body
[2:23:43] When you pray for somebody whether they
[2:23:45] know it or not and they get well
[2:23:50] then you know God's with you
[2:24:05] for the builders everyone had his sword
[2:24:08] girded by his side and soaked built and
[2:24:14] and he that sounded the trumpet was by
[2:24:18] me and I said unto the Nobles and to the
[2:24:21] rulers and to the rest of the people
[2:24:25] the work is great and large
[2:24:28] and we are separated
[2:24:31] upon the wall
[2:24:33] one far from another remember the walls
[2:24:37] two and a half miles
[2:24:40] long
[2:24:43] so they can't see they're watching for
[2:24:45] one another they're girded up they're
[2:24:48] ready for all that they can do
[2:24:51] and he said
[2:24:53] he said into what place therefore ye
[2:24:57] hear the sound of the trumpet Resort ye
[2:25:00] hither unto us our God shall fight for
[2:25:05] us
[2:25:06] how many beliefs we got a trumpet
[2:25:10] amen what happens when the enemy comes
[2:25:13] in like a flood we go we we come to the
[2:25:17] trumpet sound and We Gather in the word
[2:25:21] of God we gather around the promises of
[2:25:24] God we so we put on the full armor of
[2:25:27] God and we take the sword of God's word
[2:25:29] and we repel
[2:25:33] the attack of the enemy
[2:25:36] why because we're a people
[2:25:43] we love one another
[2:25:45] we love this message I love you that you
[2:25:48] love this message
[2:25:49] I love you that God loves you
[2:25:53] I love you for the stand you've taken
[2:25:58] I know it's hard
[2:26:01] you know our women don't wear pants
[2:26:04] we don't wear pants at work there's no
[2:26:07] work situation there's no circumstance
[2:26:09] women don't wear pants
[2:26:12] I didn't make that up
[2:26:16] and sometimes there's a lot of reproach
[2:26:21] and that's part of being an odd people
[2:26:25] that's part of being elected
[2:26:28] that's part of the burden that goes with
[2:26:31] the Revelation God's given you
[2:26:34] you will be despised
[2:26:36] of the world
[2:26:37] and Satan desires to Sifty a sand but he
[2:26:42] said I've prayed for you
[2:26:45] bear the reproach
[2:26:47] it will be worth it all and you'll find
[2:26:51] out someday somebody will come and
[2:26:54] inquire of you why do you let your hair
[2:26:57] grow why don't you wear pants why do you
[2:27:00] do the things you can do and then you
[2:27:02] can stand up
[2:27:04] and share with him the Glorious life
[2:27:07] that you have in your heart that makes
[2:27:10] it worth all while
[2:27:11] I want to finish this up read a few
[2:27:13] quotes and we'll be gone this morning I
[2:27:16] hope the word
[2:27:18] it is with you and so we see here that
[2:27:22] we can't be separated one for another
[2:27:25] we have to have a place that we can all
[2:27:28] come together that God shall fight for
[2:27:31] us
[2:27:32] that's why this scripture says forsake
[2:27:34] not the assembling of yourselves
[2:27:36] together
[2:27:37] forsake not Fellowship
[2:27:40] forsake not prayer
[2:27:42] for we labor so we labored in the work
[2:27:46] half of them held the Spears
[2:27:49] from the rising of the morning
[2:27:52] tell the Stars appeared and likewise the
[2:27:56] same time I said unto the people let
[2:27:59] everyone with his servant Lodge in
[2:28:03] Jerusalem
[2:28:06] amen
[2:28:07] let's stay in the spirit
[2:28:10] let's Lodge in the spirit
[2:28:13] Lord forgive me for every time I've went
[2:28:16] outside
[2:28:17] I'm sorry that I do it but let me come
[2:28:22] Lodge in the city
[2:28:24] let me stay in the presence where I can
[2:28:28] watch and look after one another
[2:28:36] that in the night they may be a guard to
[2:28:39] us
[2:28:40] and labor
[2:28:42] on the day
[2:28:48] watching and guarding
[2:28:50] Unity together watching and guarding so
[2:28:54] neither I nor my brethren nor my
[2:28:57] servants nor the men of the Guard which
[2:29:01] followed me
[2:29:03] none of us put off our clothes
[2:29:05] saved that everyone put them off
[2:29:11] for washing
[2:29:13] they stayed ready
[2:29:15] they stayed pervert they were convinced
[2:29:19] I'll just read a few statements here
[2:29:24] this is out of
[2:29:27] convinced and concerned
[2:29:29] in 1962-118.
[2:29:33] he says
[2:29:37] now that's the only way that I see for
[2:29:41] there to come a concern in the church
[2:29:45] and back among the people is to stay
[2:29:49] long enough until you're convinced that
[2:29:53] the program is right
[2:29:57] foreign
[2:30:01] and not some mental illusion or emotion
[2:30:05] or psychology or some workup it's
[2:30:09] absolutely the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:30:12] that God promised to pour out in the
[2:30:16] last days
[2:30:19] that's the reason the seminaries are
[2:30:21] dropping off they've seen that all that
[2:30:25] they get somehow or another
[2:30:28] it's always promised something that you
[2:30:31] never get to
[2:30:39] I want to get it
[2:30:41] everybody agree with me on that I don't
[2:30:44] want to promise as promises promises
[2:30:46] that we never get to he says there's a
[2:30:49] reason for that it's a lack of being
[2:30:52] convinced
[2:30:58] he says
[2:30:59] something they promise and they just
[2:31:02] keep promising and promising and
[2:31:05] promising and you never get it
[2:31:07] but the promise is unto you and to your
[2:31:11] children and to them that are far off
[2:31:14] even as many as our Lord Our God shall
[2:31:17] call
[2:31:18] Peter said in the day of Pentecost it
[2:31:21] just isn't for a group away back in some
[2:31:25] other age it's today how far as many as
[2:31:29] the Lord Our God shall call the signs
[2:31:33] was to follow the believer so that they
[2:31:37] would know who they were
[2:31:39] giving a Vindication of them that they
[2:31:45] were
[2:31:46] all praise God
[2:31:50] I would ask for that
[2:31:53] I would pursue that
[2:31:55] I would be convinced that that word is
[2:31:58] true but I can solve that question in my
[2:32:01] heart
[2:32:04] now Andrew
[2:32:08] became very very concerned because he
[2:32:11] stayed with them all night and was
[2:32:14] convinced and then when he became
[2:32:18] convinced
[2:32:19] that he was the Christ then he was
[2:32:22] concerned about somebody else
[2:32:28] what happened
[2:32:30] they were convinced the wall was of God
[2:32:32] they knew that God wanted to do it they
[2:32:35] were persevering and doing it they were
[2:32:38] so convinced and then what do you see
[2:32:39] now they were concerned
[2:32:42] about one another they stood watch over
[2:32:45] one another
[2:32:48] if one would couldn't pay their rent
[2:32:51] they would go around and muster up
[2:32:53] everything
[2:32:58] they would take care of one another
[2:33:00] they make sure people had food they make
[2:33:03] sure that it was good
[2:33:06] charity begins first at the house of God
[2:33:16] he said
[2:33:17] he was concerned about and I believe
[2:33:20] that every man every woman every boy or
[2:33:23] girl that ever stays long
[2:33:26] enough
[2:33:28] that they're convinced that it's right
[2:33:31] and it's the Holy Ghost
[2:33:33] you are burdened so hard in your heart
[2:33:38] that you can't stand still and let these
[2:33:42] people die like this is a shame
[2:33:46] die like this in shame and sin
[2:33:51] it'll grind the very heart out of you to
[2:33:55] get out here on these streets
[2:33:58] it does any Christian to see the people
[2:34:02] wholly given over to sin drinking
[2:34:06] gambling cursing swearing smoking every
[2:34:10] car you pull up behind it's a woman with
[2:34:14] a cigarette in her finger and with one
[2:34:17] of these water head haircuts they're
[2:34:20] using now and all this common nonsense
[2:34:24] and thousands professing to be
[2:34:27] Christians
[2:34:29] convinced and concerned and you was
[2:34:32] concerned for about his brother as soon
[2:34:35] as he was absolutely convinced
[2:34:38] that the Messiah how did he do it he
[2:34:43] stayed with him all night
[2:34:46] but the thing then is that loses
[2:34:49] concerned and after a while you've lost
[2:34:52] the hole you've lost everything if
[2:34:56] you're not concerned about anything but
[2:35:00] just your own self
[2:35:02] that was paragraph 122.
[2:35:07] do you see what he's saying
[2:35:09] this message slips away from people why
[2:35:13] they just quit being concerned about one
[2:35:17] another
[2:35:19] concerned about lost souls concern being
[2:35:22] involved
[2:35:24] concerning that there's more life don't
[2:35:27] let the world gobble you up don't let
[2:35:29] your job gobble you up don't let the I
[2:35:32] thought brother Tim did such a beautiful
[2:35:35] job this morning saying don't let all
[2:35:37] the negativity out there take an effect
[2:35:40] on you
[2:35:43] you know you're a part of what's right
[2:35:55] it's paragraph 235 that's it brother
[2:35:59] we're concerned about our brother
[2:36:02] when we're convinced that it's God
[2:36:06] and if the Pentecostal people are
[2:36:09] convinced it's God then they'd be
[2:36:12] concerned about our Brethren that's
[2:36:14] right and we act like
[2:36:18] that we're not fully convinced and
[2:36:21] sometimes when we pray for the sick and
[2:36:24] the sick just keeps going on we say well
[2:36:28] I don't know pray for me again
[2:36:32] on back and forth we act like we're not
[2:36:35] thoroughly convinced that God keeps his
[2:36:39] promise
[2:36:40] God keeps his promise brother certainly
[2:36:44] he does
[2:36:46] if it isn't God if it isn't God's
[2:36:50] promise then he don't have to keep it
[2:36:53] but if he if it's his promise he must
[2:36:58] keep it in order to be God ain't nothing
[2:37:01] wrong with God it's with you and I
[2:37:08] amen
[2:37:10] amen
[2:37:15] I like to read this last statement to
[2:37:17] you
[2:37:18] this is paragraph
[2:37:20] 258.
[2:37:22] convinced then concerned
[2:37:26] so I believe that all the Protestants
[2:37:29] believe
[2:37:32] and the great Evangelistic move
[2:37:36] that really born of the spirit of God
[2:37:40] or God any God
[2:37:43] uh about them they know the Holy Spirit
[2:37:47] comes
[2:37:51] but they don't say
[2:37:54] that he when he comes
[2:37:57] that he changes his nature
[2:38:01] see
[2:38:03] they seem to be
[2:38:05] they think
[2:38:07] well he just intolerance
[2:38:12] the world
[2:38:15] he's just in tolerates the world
[2:38:18] and the people grow on living the same
[2:38:22] way as always you know
[2:38:25] just go to church and try to be Good
[2:38:28] Fellows and do the best they can that's
[2:38:32] not it friend
[2:38:34] and I like what he said
[2:38:37] the the new birth isn't just an
[2:38:40] intolerance to the world
[2:38:45] and sometimes the new birth is preached
[2:38:48] to our young people that if you're doing
[2:38:50] this and if you're doing that if if
[2:38:54] you're doing this if you're doing that
[2:38:56] you need the Holy Ghost
[2:38:58] in other words it's intolerance to sin
[2:39:03] that's what the Holy Spirit does you
[2:39:05] become intolerant to the world
[2:39:08] intolerant to sin
[2:39:10] but I want you to know that the prophet
[2:39:12] said it's more than that
[2:39:15] it's more than that
[2:39:19] if you love him
[2:39:22] you don't love the things of the world
[2:39:25] now they still may work on you
[2:39:28] like he said there's some that hate it
[2:39:30] when they do wrong
[2:39:32] and there's others that don't care
[2:39:35] but he makes this so it's not an
[2:39:37] intolerance we're not preaching oh if
[2:39:40] you had the Holy Ghost you wouldn't play
[2:39:41] video games no if your Nature's changed
[2:39:47] yeah
[2:39:49] there's not the there's not the need for
[2:39:52] it
[2:39:54] but if you're in this generation with
[2:39:57] everything that's going on out there
[2:40:00] with everything that's pressing
[2:40:03] if we don't get rid of the rubble we
[2:40:05] can't see our enemy if we're not
[2:40:07] watching one for another
[2:40:11] we can't see them
[2:40:14] and if you don't have a change in nature
[2:40:16] this becomes hiding places
[2:40:20] we hide in the rubble like the enemy is
[2:40:23] going to do we think that we're not
[2:40:25] exposed I don't care about being exposed
[2:40:27] to one another I don't I want him to see
[2:40:31] me
[2:40:33] didn't you see the queen
[2:40:36] yeah I saw the queen but she didn't see
[2:40:38] me
[2:40:40] I want him to see me
[2:40:42] and so much of the need for sports and
[2:40:47] for music and for games in those things
[2:40:51] and I'm not against those things young
[2:40:53] people are young
[2:40:54] got a lot of vigor I used to play
[2:40:57] football with the brothers
[2:40:59] I used to be able to throw the ball 55
[2:41:01] yards
[2:41:02] of course I can hardly lift my arm knob
[2:41:04] now because of it
[2:41:07] yeah I'm not that's not what I'm talking
[2:41:09] about
[2:41:10] I'm talking about when it becomes a need
[2:41:12] to hide
[2:41:15] a need to occupy time
[2:41:18] because you're not drawn to it you're
[2:41:22] not becoming what you're not convinced
[2:41:24] there's something there for you and
[2:41:27] you're not concerned
[2:41:29] and when you're not concerned you'll
[2:41:32] find yourself with a lot of idle time
[2:41:36] and I grew up hearing this statement the
[2:41:39] idle mind is the Devil's Playground
[2:41:46] about the work but this is what he says
[2:41:51] when the Holy Ghost comes into you he
[2:41:54] makes you a new creature
[2:41:58] yes sir
[2:42:00] he makes you a new creature
[2:42:02] and he puts himself within you
[2:42:06] and you are his Idol
[2:42:12] amen wow
[2:42:20] can you imagine that he puts himself in
[2:42:22] you and then he loves you because you're
[2:42:25] he's in you
[2:42:26] his sons in you
[2:42:30] you're what he lifts up
[2:42:32] you're what he takes care of
[2:42:35] it's like God worshiping the god in you
[2:42:39] it's it's yeah oh
[2:42:42] Hallelujah
[2:42:43] There's Hope
[2:42:45] There's Hope for me
[2:42:49] because God so loved the world he gave
[2:42:52] his only begotten son who would ever
[2:42:54] believe on him he give them power to
[2:42:58] become the Sons and Daughters of God
[2:43:04] Glory it's our promise
[2:43:08] don't let no
[2:43:10] brown-eyed blue-eyed green-eyed little
[2:43:13] long last boy bad as little eyes at you
[2:43:17] sisters and take anything from you
[2:43:21] amen you leave your life behind
[2:43:24] if it's marked or scarred that's not
[2:43:27] important to God because he's thrown it
[2:43:29] in the sea of God forgetfulness you
[2:43:31] start living
[2:43:33] and let him live in you
[2:43:36] and when the Holy Ghost comes unto you
[2:43:38] he makes you a new creature yes sir he
[2:43:42] makes you a new creature and he puts
[2:43:44] himself within you and you are his Idol
[2:43:48] you he's living inside of you working
[2:43:54] moving his own way in
[2:43:58] you
