[27:09] Heavenly Father we're grateful this
[27:11] evening
[27:12] once again for your
[27:14] sweet presence
[27:18] knowing that
[27:21] you said that you would be with us
[27:25] that you would watch over us
[27:28] that you would be our Shepherd
[27:32] that your rod and your staff would come
[27:34] for us
[27:35] no matter where that we walked
[27:39] and Lord the many times we may not
[27:42] recognize it or
[27:45] feel it
[27:46] but we know it's true because your word
[27:49] does not fail
[27:51] and that's what we rely on Father we
[27:54] rely on every promise that you gave us
[27:57] and we ask you to bless us this evening
[27:59] father and be with us in a mighty way
[28:03] and
[28:04] just lift up our hearts that we might be
[28:07] about your business we ask these things
[28:10] in Jesus precious and holy name we pray
[28:14] amen
[28:16] amen Lord bless you tonight if you have
[28:19] your Bibles let's turn over to the
[28:23] gospel of Saint Luke
[28:25] and
[28:27] starting in the
[28:30] 24th chapter
[28:32] and the
[28:34] 32nd verse amen I I
[28:39] um I'm going to see if I can be shorter
[28:42] than this morning
[28:44] and somebody came to me and they said
[28:46] brother McGarry that was good but it was
[28:50] awful short
[28:51] and I thought well you know
[28:54] that's all right
[28:55] Short's good
[28:57] I believe there's a statement somewhere
[28:59] he said that the best sermons are only
[29:03] 25 to 30 minutes long so I'm not that
[29:07] good of a Preacher
[29:09] amen let's read here it's a great story
[29:12] I I think it just is wonderful I like to
[29:16] read it
[29:18] he said and they said one to another did
[29:20] not our hearts burn within us
[29:23] well he talked with us by the way
[29:27] and while he opened
[29:30] the scriptures to us Luke the 24th
[29:34] chapter and the 33rd verse and they rose
[29:38] up the same hour
[29:40] and returned to Jerusalem and found the
[29:44] eleven gathered together and them that
[29:47] were with them saying the Lord is risen
[29:51] indeed and hath appeared to Simon
[29:55] and they told what things were done in
[29:58] the way and how he was known to them in
[30:02] the breaking of bread
[30:04] and as they
[30:06] spoke Jesus himself stood in the midst
[30:10] of them and said unto them peace be unto
[30:15] you
[30:16] but they were terrified
[30:18] and Afraid and supposed that they had
[30:22] seen the spirit
[30:24] and he said unto them why are ye
[30:27] troubled
[30:28] and why do
[30:30] we do thoughts arise in your hearts
[30:33] behold my hands and my feet
[30:37] that it is I myself handle me and see
[30:42] for the spirit hath not Flesh and Bones
[30:45] as ye see me have and when he had spoken
[30:50] and showed them his hands and his feet
[30:53] and well they yet believed
[30:57] it and while they yet believe not for
[31:02] joy and wonder he said unto them have ye
[31:08] hear any me and they gave him a piece of
[31:13] boiled fish and of honeycomb and he took
[31:17] it and did eat before them and he said
[31:21] unto them these are the words which I
[31:24] spoke unto you while I was yet with you
[31:28] that all things must be fulfilled which
[31:31] were written in the law of Moses and in
[31:35] the prophets and in the Psalms
[31:37] concerning me then opened he their
[31:41] understanding that they might understand
[31:44] the scriptures and he said unto them
[31:47] this
[31:50] thus it is written and thus it behoove
[31:53] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[31:57] dead the third day
[32:00] and that repentance
[32:02] and remission of sins should be preached
[32:06] in his name among all nations beginning
[32:10] at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of
[32:13] these things and behold I will send the
[32:16] promise of my father upon you but Terry
[32:20] in the city of Jerusalem until ye
[32:25] be endured with power from on high and
[32:29] he led them out as far as to Bethany and
[32:34] he lifted up his hands and blessed them
[32:37] and it came to pass while he blessed
[32:40] them he as he parted from them he
[32:45] carried up into heaven and they
[32:48] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[32:50] with great joy and were continually in
[32:54] the temple praising and blessing God
[32:57] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[33:00] word in your precious name we pray amen
[33:04] amen God bless you
[33:08] what uh
[33:11] what a wonderful story
[33:13] I you know I I think that it's it's
[33:17] always
[33:19] I guess in man's nature when God comes
[33:23] by that that there's always an element
[33:25] of maybe a little of a little fear or
[33:29] something
[33:30] rising up in your heart but I like the
[33:33] words that he always speaks he says
[33:35] peace be still but I I remember many
[33:40] times in their prayer line the prophet
[33:42] of God would say to the people he would
[33:45] say now don't worry that won't hurt you
[33:48] it's only the Lord Jesus amen that's the
[33:51] kind of love that he had and that warm
[33:54] sweet Spirit it wouldn't hurt you I just
[33:57] wanted to just uh
[33:59] this uh wonderful Easter day and we
[34:05] talked about it this morning how that
[34:07] what
[34:10] type of man that Jesus was the love that
[34:13] he had in his heart The Compassion the
[34:16] kindness the the
[34:18] great ability to endure and and to stay
[34:23] with and not forsake his disciples
[34:26] though they must have put him through
[34:29] all kinds of Trials we find that they
[34:32] were continually murmuring in their
[34:34] heart and questioning him and a lot of
[34:38] things we could take place and he was
[34:41] always with nails guard hands uh uh
[34:45] rebuking him I could say it that way
[34:47] with that tender love I'll say you know
[34:50] why do you murmur why do you complain
[34:53] you know oh ye of little faith you know
[34:56] he's always trying to get him to believe
[34:58] and to recognize everything that was
[35:02] there for him and and as we were just
[35:06] talking about all that he was and the
[35:09] great eight things that he came to
[35:13] accomplish because we know that sin
[35:18] separated man from God
[35:21] and man could still worship God
[35:24] man could still be aware that there was
[35:27] a God in fact Man All Through Time
[35:30] looked and they saw something that was
[35:33] greater than they were and they would
[35:36] worship it excuse me
[35:40] we find out that
[35:43] in many places they found that people
[35:45] worship the Sun
[35:47] because it was a great power and and
[35:51] they they realized that that it brought
[35:53] light and life and it it was important
[35:57] to their substance they never realized
[36:00] the power
[36:02] of the Sun and where that power came
[36:05] from that that power came from a creator
[36:08] that put that power in the sun to do
[36:12] what it was created for
[36:15] and we find that about the Moon that the
[36:19] moon was a great reflector of the Sun so
[36:22] the moon uh performed the function for
[36:27] which God created it for so the the Sea
[36:32] and the tide and we know the moon and
[36:34] Tim has the effect on the tide the tide
[36:37] coming up and the going out and the
[36:40] rivers and the lakes and everything was
[36:43] put into motion for God because God had
[36:45] a purpose
[36:47] in everything in fact he wrote the first
[36:50] Bible in the stars and in the Zodiac and
[36:54] in nature itself and Paul spoke it this
[36:58] way he said the invisible things of God
[37:01] are clearly seen by the visible things
[37:04] around us as we see God everywhere
[37:08] we see the purpose of God and so we see
[37:12] that in the Sun that God put
[37:16] that power in the sun he put the power
[37:19] in the plant to grow up and to bring
[37:23] forth life and and it could there if I
[37:26] could say that upon upon everything that
[37:29] we could see there was a power placed
[37:33] within it in order for it to carry out
[37:37] his good pleasure
[37:39] and so we talked about this great man
[37:42] got separated from God and so the only
[37:46] place that man could find God is in the
[37:49] things that they could see and touch
[37:52] and then we know we could go through the
[37:54] great Bible stories of of how that God
[37:57] appeared and how he separated out of
[38:00] people and how that he got a land
[38:03] everything in Shadow and type so that we
[38:06] could look at the great Bible story and
[38:09] we could see what God was unfolding for
[38:12] us
[38:13] our beautiful unfolding of the word of
[38:16] God but one day he came and he broke the
[38:20] chain and broke what separated man from
[38:24] God and that was sin
[38:27] he he paid the price for sin
[38:31] that is important to me
[38:34] because I would hate to have to pay my
[38:37] own debt because I don't have the
[38:40] ability to pay the debt I don't have the
[38:42] means to pay the debt I'm insufficient
[38:45] to pay the debt what was uh would be
[38:49] required I uh if if I had to work I
[38:53] couldn't work a lifetime to pay it if I
[38:57] had to sell all that I had I couldn't
[39:00] accumulate enough to pay the debt I I
[39:04] was indebted forever to sin because the
[39:08] day that I was born in sin and shaped in
[39:11] iniquity came and speaking lies I was
[39:14] indebted to God from my first breath
[39:19] when I
[39:21] as a child I I you would steal a cookie
[39:25] you'd have cookie crumbs on your face
[39:27] and the cookie in your hand and Mommy
[39:31] would say did you take a cookie and
[39:33] you'd say no Mommy
[39:35] I did and why because it was your nature
[39:39] you you know if I mean it was your
[39:41] nature so many times you see a child
[39:44] that oh they they I think the first word
[39:47] they learn is mine
[39:50] you know somehow another kid will pick
[39:52] up their toy and they go mine it's mine
[39:56] and you'll see him fight and and you'll
[39:58] see him holler and scream and just carry
[40:01] on because somebody's got their toy and
[40:05] where did they get that you know did you
[40:07] parents teach that to them
[40:09] you don't know if it was the attributes
[40:13] of sin it was the condition that man was
[40:16] in because they were separated from God
[40:19] that they didn't have that touch that
[40:22] Supernatural touch from God and if so
[40:26] man was separated from sin and then we
[40:28] know that he paid a great price for that
[40:31] he paid the debt
[40:33] amen I owe the debt that I could not pay
[40:37] He Paid a Debt he did not owe and that
[40:41] that payment of that debt set us free
[40:44] and now man could enter into fellowship
[40:47] with God and and so we find in this
[40:51] great story here that that they finally
[40:55] came to know the Lord and they were
[40:58] blessed with great joy and he told them
[41:01] to go out and he gave him a commission
[41:04] he said that the gospel should be
[41:07] preached and sent to the Salvation of
[41:10] sins and act in the salvation of man
[41:14] should be preached in all the nations
[41:16] beginning at Jerusalem he was going to
[41:21] bring this good news to the world
[41:25] and that's what he told them you're
[41:27] Witnesses of this and and we believe in
[41:31] their scriptures where Paul speaks he
[41:33] says that we he's this week neglect not
[41:37] such a great salvation that we heard of
[41:40] of them that witnessed it and then it
[41:43] was shared and brought to us so we're
[41:46] sitting here tonight because somebody
[41:48] witnessed that many many years ago
[41:52] and they begin to tell the story
[41:55] but you know the the the part that
[41:58] seemed to have been lost is that he told
[42:02] them to wait until they were endued with
[42:06] power and authority from on high
[42:11] and uh you know it's a paradox
[42:16] I find in the scripture because he gave
[42:19] us power and authority but yet he told
[42:23] us to be subject one to another
[42:27] so just like the power that he gave the
[42:30] son
[42:31] it had a specific purpose and reason
[42:36] behind the power that he gave the son
[42:40] and the power that he was going to give
[42:43] the church it had a Pacific purpose and
[42:48] a Pacific reason behind that power that
[42:52] he gave them because everything that God
[42:54] does has a purpose
[42:59] he didn't give the power and authority
[43:03] to us because he tempered it in fact he
[43:06] said that power without character is
[43:09] satanic
[43:11] so it wasn't power for power's sake or
[43:15] authority for Authority sake because he
[43:19] told us to be subject one to another and
[43:22] if you think well what did he give me
[43:23] power and authority for
[43:27] and I think that's what we got to begin
[43:30] to understand that when God empowers
[43:33] somebody that if the empowerment is
[43:37] given not for a display
[43:44] or knock for a if I could say this
[43:49] some sort of a personal
[43:52] gratification or some sort of personal
[43:57] uh
[43:59] exalting of oneself and he said that
[44:03] that's even when they say they came back
[44:05] and they were rejoicing I think the
[44:08] brothers just mentioned that in their
[44:09] prayer that they were rejoicing over the
[44:13] fact that the Devils were subject to
[44:15] them and he said don't rejoice in that
[44:18] he said but rather
[44:21] Rejoice because your name if written in
[44:25] the Lambs
[44:27] Book of Life
[44:28] how how much greater so we talk about
[44:32] this great power and authority and the
[44:34] purpose that God gave it to us and we
[44:37] know in Peter he says be sober and be be
[44:41] vigilant because of your adversary the
[44:45] devil is like a roaring lion going about
[44:49] seeking whom he may devour so we know
[44:52] that the power and authority that's
[44:55] given to the church was the power and
[44:58] authority to defeat the adversary
[45:02] because that's what an adversary is an
[45:05] adversary is is what some call an
[45:10] opponent
[45:11] or one that is in opposition of your
[45:15] goal
[45:16] and we run a race don't we at the end
[45:20] the race is into the Swift but it's to
[45:23] those that endure those that stay true
[45:27] to course those that don't lose the
[45:30] vision so the power and authority that
[45:33] God gave the church was directed solely
[45:37] at the adversary
[45:40] that's right the adversary
[45:43] the one that opposes every promise that
[45:47] God gives us every every thing that God
[45:53] bought for us at Calvary all the
[45:56] blessings that he poured onto us all the
[45:59] promises that he had given us in his
[46:03] word and had you ever have one of those
[46:06] little promised little things where you
[46:08] go up and you pull the little promise
[46:10] out and you read your promise for the
[46:13] day you know I I encourage that I think
[46:16] every day you ought to find a promise
[46:19] a promise because it's by these precious
[46:23] promises that were partakers of divine
[46:27] nature and we have an adversary and what
[46:30] the adversary is opposed to he's opposed
[46:34] to those promises whether he battles you
[46:37] in your mind whether he points out your
[46:41] shortcomings uh whether he makes
[46:43] accusation against you
[46:47] there's there's no telling the number of
[46:50] ways that he uses to oppose you
[46:55] and kind of fight against you
[46:57] and to rob you of the joy of your
[47:01] salvation he's an opponent
[47:04] he's adverse
[47:07] another clip you want to go put it in
[47:10] Drive he's trying to get you to put it
[47:12] in reverse
[47:14] you want to go up he wants to push you
[47:16] down you want to go to the right he
[47:19] tries to turn the road to the left I
[47:21] don't care what is his whole purpose is
[47:24] to oppose you
[47:27] he opposes you
[47:30] you wouldn't think but keep just that's
[47:33] what he is he's the your adversary
[47:36] and Peter said thinking not strange that
[47:39] the fiery darts of your enemy the trying
[47:42] of your faith
[47:43] it's it it's such a a a a a battle that
[47:50] that we have because of the great
[47:52] adversary and he fought Jesus tooth and
[47:55] nail his whole Ministry
[47:58] trying to keep Jesus from going to that
[48:00] cross
[48:03] because once he went to that cross he
[48:05] was defeated he oh he thought he had him
[48:09] well he said I got you now and he put
[48:12] the Stinger of death in him I love how
[48:14] our messenger tells that story but
[48:17] something happened
[48:18] he overcame death
[48:20] he overcame
[48:22] the grave he overcame the sting and he
[48:26] did it by the spirit that was in him
[48:31] amen the the the victory was in love
[48:35] divine that father I've loved them that
[48:39] are in the world he said and I've loved
[48:41] them till the end might they know the
[48:44] love in where that we love one another
[48:46] so we see that the power and authority
[48:50] that was given to the church was given
[48:54] to be over the adversary not over one
[48:58] another
[49:00] even he told the ministry he said
[49:02] whatever you do don't become Lords over
[49:05] God's Heritage and let the greatest
[49:08] among you be the least and
[49:11] serve the younger and so the pitcher is
[49:16] what's beautiful because he wrote this
[49:19] great picture and he opened up their
[49:22] understanding and showed them in the
[49:25] scripture that he had overcome the
[49:28] adversary
[49:29] because these things were written of
[49:31] them that he must suffer and die and
[49:35] Rise the third day can you imagine I
[49:39] would have liked to have been there for
[49:41] that service
[49:43] how do you like Jesus to open the
[49:46] scripture
[49:47] well what has Jesus always do
[49:50] you know he just doesn't come down and
[49:53] and give you a sensation or or give you
[49:57] a feeling but he always opens it up into
[50:02] the word of God and I believe in
[50:05] blessing I believe in praising God the
[50:07] Bible says that they went into the
[50:09] temple and they praised God continually
[50:12] day and night what were they doing they
[50:15] were thanking him for what that he had
[50:18] revealed to them
[50:21] they're great too
[50:24] now we're possessors
[50:26] of eternal life
[50:30] what a revelation
[50:32] how would you like to have been there
[50:34] when Jesus explained to you that you've
[50:37] got eternal life that you would never
[50:40] die that he that that that would not
[50:44] suffer the second death as many as
[50:46] believed on him he gave power to become
[50:49] the Sons and Daughters of God that was
[50:52] the good news amen they followed them
[50:54] and they saw us works and they saw the
[50:57] things that he'd done and and yet they
[51:00] had a different expectation
[51:03] oh we thought that you were he that
[51:06] would Deliver Us from the hand of the
[51:09] Romans Grace do we know that's how they
[51:12] felt because the conversation prior to
[51:14] this was them walking to Emmaus
[51:17] oh this is a great thing we thought oh
[51:21] we thought he would be can you imagine
[51:22] here they are talking to him the very
[51:25] Lord Of Glory and they're saying you
[51:27] haven't heard of yourself
[51:29] you know you haven't heard of you
[51:31] haven't heard of what's what's happened
[51:34] these days here's the guy it happened to
[51:36] amen
[51:39] you know it kind of reminds me of a true
[51:41] story there there was a a great guitar
[51:44] player uh uh that is pretty famous and
[51:49] his name was Chad Atkins
[51:52] and Chet Atkins was on a cruise and and
[51:55] there was a man playing a guitar out on
[51:58] the deck of the cruise and uh Chet
[52:01] Atkins walked up to him and said uh do
[52:03] you mind if I I play a little and so he
[52:06] took the guitar and he played a little
[52:08] bit you know and said this is a nice
[52:11] guitar and very good and played a few
[52:14] things and gave it back to the guy and
[52:15] the guy looked at him and said you know
[52:17] you're pretty good but you ain't no Chet
[52:19] Atkins
[52:25] you know I thought about that a little
[52:28] bit
[52:29] and you know we kind of take that same
[52:33] stance with the Lord sometime
[52:36] but but here they were talking to him
[52:40] and they didn't know because their eyes
[52:41] were holding
[52:43] and and it and they sat there and then
[52:46] they they they they their hearts burned
[52:49] within them because what was he doing he
[52:52] was going over the scriptures with them
[52:54] and and showing them in the scriptures
[52:56] and laying out the scriptures and what's
[52:59] so beautiful about this story here here
[53:02] he was he was going to give them power
[53:05] from on high he was going to endure him
[53:08] with power from on high he was going to
[53:11] give them power and authority over their
[53:14] adversaries but first he had to tie it
[53:17] to the scriptures
[53:22] because the word is what has the power
[53:25] and authority over Satan
[53:29] Satan can impersonate any gift but he
[53:32] can't impersonate that word that word is
[53:35] the absolute that word is the ultimate
[53:38] that word is what's going to happen all
[53:40] God needs us to do is have faith in it
[53:45] believe that's the way it's going to be
[53:47] not falter from it not try to fix it
[53:52] let him fix it
[53:54] he's the quickener
[53:58] he's the one that quickens the word and
[54:01] makes it alive in the promise that it's
[54:05] applied to okay and so this he gave him
[54:09] this great power and he he broke the
[54:11] scriptures to him and and showed him how
[54:14] that everything that took place
[54:16] beginning at Moses and the law and the
[54:20] prophets and the Psalms
[54:24] Glory
[54:26] oh I would I wanted to be on that walk
[54:33] but you know in a way I feel I have been
[54:38] because he come in this day and he
[54:41] dailed himself in in a prophet and he
[54:44] took us down through a walk through the
[54:47] scriptures he took us over in the Book
[54:50] of Revelation and showed us the seven
[54:52] Church ages he went over there and he
[54:55] opened the Seven Seals to us and he
[54:57] revealed to us the mystery of Christ
[55:00] standing in this whole last age standing
[55:03] there unfolding the great work how that
[55:06] the seed was going to go into the ground
[55:08] and come up to justification
[55:11] sanctification the restoration of the
[55:14] gifts the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[55:17] the restoration of the Capstone
[55:20] to the church oh my
[55:24] God in one way I feel I walked on that
[55:26] road
[55:28] to Emmaus in this lady of sea age
[55:31] where all the word and all the purpose
[55:34] of God was once again restored to the
[55:38] church
[55:39] turning us back to battle
[55:42] with our adversary
[55:45] that's where we have power for
[55:48] we have power to to
[55:52] defeat
[55:53] what opposes
[55:55] the word of God
[56:00] you know some things you don't have
[56:01] power over
[56:07] you don't
[56:09] you know you can stand out there all day
[56:11] long until the sun to stop still
[56:15] but if you don't have a little word
[56:18] to stop that son it's going to go right
[56:21] on with the way that God created it the
[56:25] laws of God are still going to be in
[56:28] place because all the laws of God are
[56:30] for your benefit
[56:32] you need rest
[56:34] he lets the sun go down and he he gives
[56:38] you a light to sleep by and he lets you
[56:40] reach you need food and it gives you
[56:42] Seasons a time to eat a time to plant a
[56:46] time to grow in other words God's got a
[56:48] great economy and a great Harmony that a
[56:51] Believer can live in and be at peace
[56:54] with and and love life and love the good
[56:57] things of God and love one another but
[57:00] it's when somebody that comes in and
[57:02] opposes that and tries to rob you of
[57:05] your peace and Rob you of your joy then
[57:08] then that's when you've got the power
[57:11] and authority to stop him in his tracks
[57:16] no way it's not given for demonstration
[57:23] and most of the time it's not given for
[57:25] yourself
[57:28] it's given for another person
[57:30] and and you know the the the the the the
[57:33] the
[57:35] motive there's got to be an objective
[57:39] then what's our objective with the power
[57:42] and authority that he gave us our
[57:45] objective is to stop the adversary
[57:49] stop him from robbing lives
[57:52] stop him from binding people stop him
[57:55] from stealing our children stop him from
[57:58] stealing our loved ones the the
[58:01] objective of the power that he was going
[58:04] to give the church the the reason he was
[58:07] going to give them this power and this
[58:10] Authority because they had an objective
[58:12] they had to go into all the world and
[58:15] preach the gospel and these signs shall
[58:18] follow them that believe in my name
[58:20] they'll do this you'll do this you'll do
[58:22] that why because it had an objective
[58:25] behind it
[58:27] and the objective of the power and
[58:29] authority that he was going to give him
[58:31] was for them to overcome the adversary
[58:34] as he overcame
[58:38] and what was the motive behind it
[58:41] what's the motive
[58:43] it'll never be the motives so you can
[58:46] show you got power
[58:50] that's just such a wrong motive
[58:55] it's like like
[58:57] why do you want this the baptism of the
[59:01] Holy Spirit
[59:05] you know the prophet of God said you
[59:07] have to have a reason to ask for your
[59:09] healing
[59:10] it isn't just to be healed to be healed
[59:13] to say I got healed I got healed
[59:17] I had faith
[59:19] I got healed now you're spiritually sick
[59:23] I'd rather be physically sick than
[59:25] spiritually sick
[59:30] you know that that could that's never
[59:32] what it was given for
[59:34] you know we've done this and blessed God
[59:39] you know and I'll say it and I'll say it
[59:41] all the days of my life if I knew where
[59:44] the devil was I'd be as far away from
[59:46] that place as possible
[59:49] the only reason I'm going to slay him is
[59:52] when he comes to seek me like a roaring
[59:55] lion when he comes to devour me when he
[59:58] comes to take my joy my peace my long
[1:00:02] suffering my Temperance my patience my
[1:00:05] goodness my kindness my my faith
[1:00:10] when he comes to attack the virtues that
[1:00:13] make me the statue that I'm supposed to
[1:00:15] be and the Capstone when he comes to to
[1:00:18] take for me and fight me then I've got
[1:00:21] power and authority to tell him to stop
[1:00:25] right there
[1:00:28] because he's keeping me
[1:00:32] because the power he gave me has a
[1:00:34] purpose
[1:00:38] the motive of it is to stop the enemy
[1:00:43] the objective I mean is to stop the
[1:00:45] enemy what motivates that power and
[1:00:48] authority so something's got to motivate
[1:00:51] it
[1:00:52] something's got to to bring it up
[1:00:56] you know the the
[1:00:58] athletic world
[1:01:03] oh
[1:01:06] they they try to
[1:01:10] get the person motivated excuse me
[1:01:14] because they've Talent
[1:01:19] they've got the ability
[1:01:22] I've met a lot of people that aren't
[1:01:24] just self-motivated
[1:01:26] they could do anything but they do
[1:01:28] nothing
[1:01:30] because they don't have any motivation
[1:01:33] they don't have anything that places the
[1:01:37] talent
[1:01:38] into movement
[1:01:43] and they they they they they just
[1:01:47] they just don't want to be involved
[1:01:49] or they don't want to carry a burden so
[1:01:52] we have an objective with what God's
[1:01:54] given us and and he he's he's imdued us
[1:01:58] with this great Authority
[1:02:00] over the enemy
[1:02:03] all things with the their their subject
[1:02:05] unto his word and what did he gave you
[1:02:09] he gave you his word because Satan's not
[1:02:12] going to be subject to you he's going to
[1:02:14] be subject to who's in you
[1:02:17] because greater is he that is in you
[1:02:20] than he who is in the world and can and
[1:02:24] he's in You by promise and he's in You
[1:02:26] by his word and he expresses himself and
[1:02:30] that's what the spirit does is it brings
[1:02:31] you into remembrance of everything that
[1:02:34] he said every promise that he gave you
[1:02:37] yeah it just fills you up in your fiber
[1:02:41] but there's got to be something in a
[1:02:44] believer that rises this power and
[1:02:47] authority uh to the surface where it
[1:02:50] will be used
[1:02:52] and it isn't just having it
[1:02:57] that's not the motive
[1:03:00] it's not to exercise it
[1:03:03] but the motive behind it is love
[1:03:08] what motivated God
[1:03:12] to give a son
[1:03:14] what motivated God to send his only
[1:03:18] begotten son
[1:03:20] to to to he as a father to create the
[1:03:26] second Adam in the womb of Mary
[1:03:29] and and the life that he had didn't come
[1:03:33] from Joseph it didn't come from Marriage
[1:03:36] he was the father of it
[1:03:40] amen what motivated him to do that what
[1:03:43] motivated God to become man
[1:03:47] and and to have a a a a a a a son
[1:03:52] that learned obedience by the things he
[1:03:55] suffered
[1:03:56] what motivated God to do that
[1:03:59] well you know the scripture God so loved
[1:04:02] the world is why that he did it
[1:04:06] everything that he did as we read this
[1:04:09] morning it was motivated by love so he
[1:04:13] had the power and authority but you know
[1:04:16] he had the power and authority to call
[1:04:18] down 10 Legions of angels
[1:04:22] but he didn't do it
[1:04:25] because his power and his authority was
[1:04:30] governed by his motive
[1:04:33] we never want to lose the fact yes we've
[1:04:37] got power yes we've got signs and
[1:04:40] wonders yes these Works will follow us
[1:04:42] but they don't give Glory until they're
[1:04:46] motivated by the right motive
[1:04:50] and how many people are going to come in
[1:04:52] that day and say Lord we did all these
[1:04:55] things
[1:04:57] and he's going to say you know
[1:05:01] depart from me
[1:05:06] and you say doers of iniquity
[1:05:09] you said well how can a man be doing all
[1:05:11] those things and be Wicked iniquities
[1:05:14] unbelief
[1:05:17] you didn't believe
[1:05:19] why that I
[1:05:22] gave you this power
[1:05:25] you didn't understand the reason for it
[1:05:28] you exalted yourself
[1:05:30] and that's just what the enemy wanted to
[1:05:33] do he wanted to exalt himself
[1:05:36] above the Angels he wanted to be
[1:05:39] worshiped and I wonder if sometimes if
[1:05:42] if that isn't slipping into the lives of
[1:05:46] people that they they want all a great
[1:05:49] demonstrations be because somehow they
[1:05:53] they they want it to come back to them
[1:05:57] but can you imagine a church that's
[1:06:00] motivated by the true motive objective
[1:06:03] when they see the adversary on someone
[1:06:07] that they love they see the adversary
[1:06:09] they're not just doing it because it's a
[1:06:12] promise they're just not doing it
[1:06:14] because the scriptures say we can lay
[1:06:16] hands on you and you'll rise up and and
[1:06:19] it boy if you don't rise up you ain't
[1:06:21] got no faith
[1:06:23] I'm tired of praying for people and it
[1:06:27] always being on them
[1:06:30] you know if you have faith you'll get
[1:06:32] better how about if I had love they'd
[1:06:35] get better how about if I had compassion
[1:06:38] they would get better how about if I
[1:06:40] raised to my position that I belong in
[1:06:43] that they would get better how about if
[1:06:46] I saw this being the adversary and I
[1:06:48] knew that God had given me something
[1:06:50] that he empowered me with something just
[1:06:53] like the son is empowered he empowered
[1:06:56] this son that this son could carry out
[1:06:59] the purpose that he gave that son
[1:07:06] then it's no longer me that does it but
[1:07:08] it's Christ in me that does the work
[1:07:11] is the love of God that is shed abroad
[1:07:14] in my heart that does the work it's it's
[1:07:17] the goodness of God I can't stand that
[1:07:20] devil
[1:07:23] but the minute you just take it
[1:07:27] and turn it one way or the other
[1:07:30] oh you might have power
[1:07:34] but it never accomplishes the purpose
[1:07:39] it becomes hybrid
[1:07:41] it becomes deformed
[1:07:44] it it starts to point to the church
[1:07:49] instead of to him
[1:07:53] God don't share his glory with anybody
[1:07:56] he don't need to and we don't want him
[1:07:59] to we want him to get all the praise we
[1:08:02] want him to get all the honor
[1:08:05] and so that's what motivates it wouldn't
[1:08:08] motivated he gave him this power and he
[1:08:10] gave him this Authority he told him to
[1:08:12] go preach the gospel and to be endued
[1:08:15] with power from on high so when they
[1:08:18] went into that upper room and they got
[1:08:21] the power from on high when you feel or
[1:08:25] or or think or or or or someplace
[1:08:29] because I want to enter into fellowship
[1:08:31] with you on this what do you think it
[1:08:33] was that they received
[1:08:38] was it a third person
[1:08:42] was it a
[1:08:43] uh
[1:08:44] a sensation
[1:08:47] was it anointing
[1:08:51] no
[1:08:53] because he said I
[1:08:55] will be with you and I will be in you
[1:08:59] and in that day you will know that I am
[1:09:03] in the father and I am in you
[1:09:07] Hallelujah
[1:09:09] praise God what did he pour out what did
[1:09:13] he give him he gave him the same spirit
[1:09:15] that raised him from the dead
[1:09:20] that's what he gave them
[1:09:22] because if the same spirit that was in
[1:09:26] Christ Jesus dwell in you it'll also
[1:09:29] Quicken your mortal body so what did he
[1:09:32] give him he gave him the word
[1:09:35] he gave him his word I want you to know
[1:09:38] some beautiful thing about the Lord and
[1:09:40] when we are listening to Faith it just
[1:09:43] struck me so much the that Jesus always
[1:09:47] gives you something to believe in first
[1:09:54] he just doesn't ask you to have faith
[1:09:57] he gives you a sign he gives you a
[1:10:00] wonder he gives you a conviction he
[1:10:02] gives you his word
[1:10:05] because Faith cometh by what hearing and
[1:10:08] hearing his word he gives you something
[1:10:11] to believe
[1:10:13] what do you think the prophet did when
[1:10:15] he sat there and he told the person to
[1:10:17] come up and they had a desire in their
[1:10:20] heart
[1:10:21] and the only way that they're ever going
[1:10:24] to get that desire is by faith
[1:10:27] because God works by faith
[1:10:32] he wants you to believe
[1:10:35] in fact he said if you don't believe
[1:10:37] you're slothful he says you have not
[1:10:40] because you ask not and you don't ask
[1:10:42] because you don't believe
[1:10:44] so what does he do
[1:10:47] what did he do he said oh cure you're Mr
[1:10:53] uh g.j Wags from uh such and such place
[1:10:58] and your address is
[1:11:01] 2153 West Brook Street
[1:11:04] what was he doing
[1:11:07] he was giving that man something
[1:11:11] so he he believed he said I'm going to
[1:11:14] join my faith with your faith because
[1:11:18] wherever two or three agree on any one
[1:11:20] thing it'll come to pass
[1:11:23] he was giving them Something to Believe
[1:11:28] it wasn't raw faith
[1:11:31] God's the author
[1:11:34] of our faith
[1:11:39] he that's what he was doing he was
[1:11:41] authoring the faith he was saying I'll
[1:11:44] show you this I'll do this I'll do that
[1:11:47] that's what Jesus said he said if you
[1:11:49] can't believe me for my words believe me
[1:11:52] for my works
[1:11:55] I've given you a reason to believe
[1:11:59] and he said because you've seen those
[1:12:01] things he says now you have no excuse
[1:12:06] he didn't throw him out there Raw
[1:12:10] and challenge you to have faith though
[1:12:12] he authored your faith he's given you a
[1:12:15] reason to believe how many of you are
[1:12:17] believing for things and you could turn
[1:12:19] around and look back and see the mighty
[1:12:22] hand of God in your life all along the
[1:12:24] way
[1:12:27] why because he's trying to author your
[1:12:30] faith
[1:12:32] he's trying to raise the faith up inside
[1:12:35] of you
[1:12:36] he wants your faith to be motivated by
[1:12:39] love why are you asking
[1:12:43] for demonstration purposes
[1:12:46] oh Lord I want to do a miracle because I
[1:12:49] want all of the church to know that God
[1:12:51] hears my prayers
[1:12:57] ooh that's sick
[1:13:00] that's sad
[1:13:03] but what if it's Lord
[1:13:06] I have a servant at home
[1:13:09] and he's sick
[1:13:12] he said okay I'll come pray no you don't
[1:13:16] have to pray Lord if you'll just speak
[1:13:19] the word I'm a man of authority I know I
[1:13:23] can say to this person do this and I can
[1:13:26] say to that person and do that he said
[1:13:29] if I can do this in the carnal
[1:13:32] how much more can you do it in the
[1:13:34] spiritual
[1:13:35] Lord just speak the word if you'll just
[1:13:39] say it I know my servant will be well
[1:13:44] and he says so I haven't seen such great
[1:13:46] faith in all of Israel
[1:13:48] go and find it as you so desire
[1:13:53] what motivated that
[1:13:56] Centurion to come and humble himself
[1:14:00] at the feet of Jesus love
[1:14:05] in his heart
[1:14:07] why do you think God's got the cap off
[1:14:10] this statue of a perfect man with the
[1:14:13] right motive and objective
[1:14:19] that's the thing
[1:14:21] and faith has a final resting place
[1:14:25] the resting place of faith is the word
[1:14:27] of God
[1:14:28] it's got to have I don't care what
[1:14:31] experience you have if you shout praise
[1:14:34] God I imagine these guys were shouting
[1:14:36] in the temple I can see the high priest
[1:14:39] come up say settle down boys
[1:14:43] you're getting a little Rowdy here
[1:14:45] I might have to put you in the outer
[1:14:47] Court
[1:14:48] why they were ready to go in and eat the
[1:14:51] showbread you know what I mean they were
[1:14:53] on fire they just seen the Lord Of Glory
[1:14:56] be taken up into heaven they just were
[1:14:59] commissioned to go into all the world
[1:15:01] and preach the gospel what do you think
[1:15:03] they were doing in the temples the only
[1:15:05] place they knew where to worship they
[1:15:07] were in there praying and getting fired
[1:15:09] up getting ready to hit the street
[1:15:16] then they got the power
[1:15:19] oh they're not drunk as you suppose but
[1:15:23] this is that
[1:15:25] amen
[1:15:26] you know that Capstone
[1:15:28] this is that
[1:15:31] this is this is what it is so I don't
[1:15:34] care what your experience is if you
[1:15:37] don't tie that experience to the word
[1:15:41] a scripture
[1:15:43] if if you feel a blessing of God in your
[1:15:46] life tie it to a word tie it to a
[1:15:50] scripture tie it to a promise and then
[1:15:52] it becomes Everlasting because heaven
[1:15:55] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:15:58] will not pass away blessings pass away
[1:16:01] Sensations pass away moves of the spirit
[1:16:04] pass away but his word never passes away
[1:16:08] you can anchor on it every day of your
[1:16:11] life
[1:16:13] you can know it's true and just think he
[1:16:16] took that same spirit that raised him
[1:16:18] from the dead and put it in you
[1:16:23] I I I I I just I I love it I believe the
[1:16:28] scripture like is in Saint John
[1:16:32] 14 12.
[1:16:35] I believe I might have just read it but
[1:16:37] he said
[1:16:39] he says verily verily I send to you he
[1:16:43] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:16:47] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:16:51] these shall he do because I go to my
[1:16:54] father and whatsoever ye ask in my name
[1:16:57] that will I do that the father may be
[1:17:01] glorified in the son
[1:17:05] if ye shall ask anything in my name I
[1:17:09] will do it if ye love me keep my
[1:17:12] commandment
[1:17:13] oh why did he take the spirit that he
[1:17:17] had
[1:17:20] that Rose him from the dead
[1:17:23] why did he give it to us
[1:17:29] for a sensation
[1:17:33] know that we could do the same works
[1:17:37] that he did that we wouldn't be ashamed
[1:17:41] that we would know that he's within us
[1:17:44] and that we have the power
[1:17:47] and Authority to perform that which he
[1:17:52] gave us the spirit for just like the
[1:17:55] sun's power was placed in it
[1:17:58] by the Creator the power is placed in
[1:18:02] You by the same creator
[1:18:05] by the same one that gave you the spirit
[1:18:07] that's why he gives you his spirit
[1:18:11] not to say I'm Spirit-filled but to say
[1:18:15] now I can do the works that he did
[1:18:18] because I can do all things through
[1:18:21] Christ Jesus who strengthens me I work
[1:18:24] that I do and he did I can do also not
[1:18:28] me that does the work but Christ that
[1:18:31] dwelleth in me thus the work and our
[1:18:35] understanding becomes open now we start
[1:18:37] becoming an army that's motivated by
[1:18:40] love and we start seeing that adversary
[1:18:43] taking our possessions taking our joy
[1:18:46] shaking our peace taking our loved ones
[1:18:49] doing all these things and finally We
[1:18:52] rise up and our love just can't stand it
[1:18:54] no more and we start moving him out
[1:18:59] I'm going to possess your gate you used
[1:19:02] to enter into this person's life through
[1:19:04] this weakness I've come with compassion
[1:19:07] and mercy to plug that hole in their
[1:19:10] life and put Christ in their stead put
[1:19:13] the Lord Jesus where you used to enter
[1:19:16] in now he's going to stand there and the
[1:19:19] protection of the Gospel is going to
[1:19:21] flow out upon him and then we start
[1:19:24] becoming a great Army because the Same
[1:19:27] Spirit
[1:19:29] that raised him from the dead
[1:19:33] is what he poured back on the church he
[1:19:37] gave him life I am the life the
[1:19:40] resurrection and the life no man cometh
[1:19:44] to the father but by me I am the
[1:19:48] resurrection and the life and I've come
[1:19:51] to dwell in you I've come to take my
[1:19:54] Abode with you I've come to invite you
[1:19:58] to invite me into your heart
[1:20:03] and I think that's what's something that
[1:20:05] we all need to do is get someplace and
[1:20:07] start inviting him back into our heart
[1:20:11] back into every part of our life back
[1:20:14] into our being Lord I really want to be
[1:20:17] victorious I really want to serve you I
[1:20:20] really want to do a work on your name I
[1:20:23] really want to spread this hope in this
[1:20:25] gospel this is the last chance the
[1:20:27] world's got
[1:20:30] if they don't come into this Ark if they
[1:20:33] don't come into this place of safety if
[1:20:35] they're left outside Lord they'll perish
[1:20:39] the last chance to get them in
[1:20:42] and in the love in your heart is moved
[1:20:45] you beyond embarrassment
[1:20:48] Beyond reproach
[1:20:52] you just can't keep still you can't hold
[1:20:55] your peace because there's a bubbling
[1:20:57] brook bubbling up inside of you what a
[1:21:00] resurrection
[1:21:02] what a resurrection that was what a
[1:21:06] resurrection this is in this day the
[1:21:10] restoration of the power of the
[1:21:13] Resurrection
[1:21:15] restored back into the bride that the
[1:21:20] same life that he had they had also he
[1:21:23] became us that we could become him all
[1:21:27] them great songs all them great stories
[1:21:29] they all come as they are understanding
[1:21:32] are opened up in the scripture so let's
[1:21:35] go have a good week
[1:21:37] let's let the love of God be shed abroad
[1:21:41] in our heart by the Holy Spirit let's
[1:21:43] let the power that God's given us let
[1:21:46] our faith rise up because the prophet of
[1:21:48] God said if we don't use the faith that
[1:21:51] God gives us he says we're being
[1:21:53] slothful
[1:21:57] oh
[1:21:59] Lord put me to work for your kingdom you
[1:22:02] love the Lord God bless you I don't know
[1:22:04] if that was shorter and this morning but
