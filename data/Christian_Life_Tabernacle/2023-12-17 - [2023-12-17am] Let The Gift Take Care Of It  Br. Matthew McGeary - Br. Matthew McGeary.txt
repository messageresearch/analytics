[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] a [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] l [Music] h [Music] amen God bless you welcome everyone in the house of God this morning are you happy to be gathered here this morning and certainly we'll invite you to stand as you invite by Mike for our Psalm reading this morning amen let's just bow our heads gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered in your presence Lord there's your children there's nothing more we enjoy than to be gathering the Assembly of Believers Lord to come and hear the word of God and so so therefore when to commit the service from the beginning to the ending into your hands father ask that you may come and take control over everything that will be done Lord let it be pleasing before your sight but above all Lord that the word may come in it may change our hearts Lord that it may impart to us the the part of you that we need Lord in order for us to overcome this world Lord we have nothing without you lord we realize that father your word is our daily bread is the thing on which we depend on your word is our access into the supernatural Lord and we ask that you give it to us for the measure that you have in store for us today so therefore we invite you and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may turn around and welcome someone amen God bless you good morning may be seated for a minute a couple weeks ago when we were reading the psalm you know we spoke of we spoke of those whose eyes wait on the Lord just as a servant would watch their Master you know and describing how there was such a closeness there that a real trusted servant could had such a familiarity with the master that he or she could see him just begin to move in a certain way and they would know what the master wants done and they would move to complete the work knowing what he wants done we're going to turn to Psalm 130 this morning and is just kind of continuing on that thought there's so much in that little Psalm it's speaks much of redemption and of forgiveness and of Mercy but you know continuing on that thought what are we looking for how are we looking and if you remember it kind of was a thought that came from what a statement that brother Brandon made and Look Away to Jesus he said but here's the thing I want to ask you tonight for these next few minutes when you look the question is what do you see when you look what do you see when you look that only depends on what you're looking for you know and we often Look to Him we set our eyes on him for our need our desire our burden what's important to us you know and it's not necessarily bad because he's our need meter he promised that he would meet our need he promised he would deliver us he promised he would heal us but you know there are often our desires you know as brother David's been sharing with us and we've been hearing through messages like leadership you know there's a point in our walk when we're looking to him shifts from what our desire is to what his desire is you know as we read last week as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God Amen you know and are we looking to him to be the provider of our need the meter of our desire sure absolutely but are we getting to a place where we're looking to him for his desire for what he wants done with all preconceived notions with all assumptions and intellectual beliefs and preferences set aside to see what he wants done you know Psalm 130:5 and 6 makes this statement says I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning now we've been taught to wait on the Lord wait on the Lord be of good courage and he will strengthen your heart but if you're anything like me I often will limit that scripture to you know a word of encouragement in my hour of need wait on the Lord and he'll strengthen your heart something I have laid before him in prayer the promise is still true but there's more here for us to lay hold of there's another level of waiting you know if you remember the many tapes we've listened to brother brandom's how many times did he start talking and then he would say you know who I'm waiting for you know and the question is is was he waiting for an answer to his desire or to his need or to his request or was he waiting to see what the Lord wanted done you know Jesus said it this way in John 59 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what soever things he doeth these also doeth the son likewise I can do nothing on my own but instead I'm watching waiting to see what he wants done you know it was kind of that thought that's been on my mind you know later he turned to his disciples in John 15 he said I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit and then he says this for without me ye can do nothing instead watching waiting to see what he wants done know not going off and doing our thing until we hear something from him you know or so busy with our thing that sometimes we have to be slapped in the face to hear what the Lord wants done but ready watching to see what he might have us do leadership verse six my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning you know the fact is we live in this age of electricity that has enabled us to pretty much do anything 24 hours a day but you know it used to be that when the sun went down you had to stop everything you you couldn't see you didn't know where to go or what to work on because you couldn't see what needed to be done you couldn't see what direction to go couldn't see where you were and so you waited and you paused and you did nothing until the sun came back out and you could see what needed to be done you could see what direction to go you could see where you needed to turn but until then you held still doing nothing until you can see my soul Waits on the Lord even more than they that watch for mourning just as much as someone would wait to see so they knew what could be worked on so that they knew where they could go being in a place where we hold still cuz we don't know what to do we don't know what he wants done he doesn't know we don't know where we he wants us to go until we wait to see or hear from him you know we're very every day I would say we're very busy people we live in a very busy age you know we're all involved in a lot of activity but I want I often have to ask myself am I waiting to see what he wants to rather than just assuming what's in front of me is his leadership what happened to I do nothing until Jesus said in Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God before we do anything we seek the desire of the king and his righteousness what he wants done and all these other things will be added unto you be taken care of interestingly enough just before that in verse 22 Jesus is speaking about eyesight where you're looking he says the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light you know that word single means clear it means focused free of distraction or obstruction but then he says but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness do you know that word evil there is actually translated everywhere else in the Bible is the word man 68 times it actually means full of Labor annoyances and hardships so if our eyesight is so full of the activity and the distractions and the pressures and the demands and the activities and the cares and the questions and the burdens of mankind if that is filling our vision we can't see clear enough to see his leadership because there's so many other things going on but what work does he want done what does he want us to be about the importance of what we're looking for as brother brandham said what are you seeing when you look how are you looking you know and my prayer is that I'm focused so clearly on him that I don't miss his leadership when he starts to move and that I'm careful to seek his leadership before I move let's go ahead and stand this morning you know I'm grateful for his Mercy for all the times I don't do that he says in verse three if thou oh Lord shouldst mark my iniquities who shall stand right you know and iniquity as we know is doing our own thing even when we know better everyone doing what seems right in their own eyes we hear from the world all the time you do you you be you but what if we were him what if we did him you know if we could get our eyes off our thing long enough to see what thing he wants us to do you know that's my prayer we go ahead and read Psalm 13 this morning it's just a short Psalm starting in verse one out of the depths have I Cried unto thee Oh Lord Lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications if thou Lord should marked iniquities oh Lord who shall stand but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared I wait for the Lord my soul do wait and in his word do I hope my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning let Israel hope in the Lord for with the Lord there is Mercy and with him is plenteous redemption and he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities amen amen God bless you may have your seats man let's sing at Calvary amen oh ye I spent in vanity and cry oh caring out my Lord

Lord amen amen so God bless you this morning if you have any need upon your heart just lift your hand the brother that has taken the offerings if you could come amen um brother Ben if you could just come and take this needs before the Lord amen let bow our hearts gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful Lord for all that you've done for us Lord this week father it's a testimony to be here

not a vain thing father we are certain Lord Jesus that only you have the answers to our needs Lord there's nothing we could do there's no strength that we could have no ritual we could partake in to

painting and just as I made a step he pulled on his hose and he tripped me and uh I kind of went straight down on both my knees and uh lesie said we got to take you to the hospital and and get you x-rayed and I said yeah he's just going to tell me that I just busted up my knees and I know that cuz I can feel it but anyway I didn't know if I could make the steps this morning or if I could stand up uh speaking very long so uh Matthew is going to uh take our service this morning but you know it really doesn't matter who's speaking when the source is the word of God for the hour amen and I I think today's Lindsay's birthday isn't that is Lindsay you're 21 today I believe it is and uh well if you look 21 then you can say you're 21 right you know I tried to say I was 60 and someone looked at me like I was crazy so anyway but we're we're grateful for that in each one you know we have some special needs and I I wanted to make them known you know uh brother Sergio and sister Dalia Morales they drive all the way from uh Tyler Texas to be in service with us and in the next few weeks they're uh they've got some real uh challenging uh events uh that will shape uh the future of their lives and uh we want to really keep them in prayer and H that they might know that we love them that we're thinking of them and that our God's the Victorious God and the scripture simply says if you seek first the kingdom of God all else will be added unto you you you never can never can fail putting God first and you can't put God first without putting his word first because him and his word are one and the Lord Jesus was that word manifested in flesh not a different flesh the same flesh that we've got tempted the same way we were tempted yet there was no sin found in him he suffered the same way we suffer in fact all of our burdens he carried that we might have hope that we can become like him and isn't that our desire this morning to become more like him because he promised us that if the same spirit that was in him dwelt in US it would Quicken our bodies and take us to where he is and we know he went somewhere because we have witness that he rose and we heard a Vindicated message telling us that he would come again and that we would be caught up together with him in the air ever to be with the Lord just think we're not far from heaven we not far far from eternal life being manifested in us the eternal life we've always had so we're so grateful for that also uh they mentioned uh brother mani and the whole sing family uh his mother just had a very extensive uh brain surgery and yet I went and visited her and she's full of joy and and laughter and the spirit and the family and uh her man's mom or sister's husband and and M's sister was there the hosting family and their faith is in a resurrected Lord Jesus so if you could through the week maybe reach out to him and the family uh give them a call let them know that you're praying for him send it a text uh just encourage them a along the way amen and and I thought uh brother Billy did a wonderful job announcing our fellowship uh in the evening you know because uh lesie let me know that we don't work on Sunday and I said well we're not working we're just praising the Lord in a different way and we're going to sing and fellowship around the good things of the Lord and and uh do whatever little things we can do move a few stuff around but uh not much just a time to have something so we're just going to have a different kind of service so uh you're surely welcome to come out and we love the Lord you love the Lord amen I I love I love Christmas time uh I love preaching Christmas messages and so next Sunday I'm going to crawl up these steps if I have to crawl up and they have to put a stick behind me to prop me up uh I want to preach the word of God I I want to love the Lord I I want to love God's people and uh uh as you know the church is painted uh you're welcome to walk through it and and tell everybody how much you love the color uh if you don't like the color then uh just focus your eyes on the pulpit here in service and uh you'll be happy so uh uh it it's really nice this morning amen it's always good to see the Alexanders with us Lord bless you all this morning and uh so God's good isn't he good he's good all the time uh he's wonderful uh we we want you to spend a lot of time with your families that's why we're not having our services and and we'll post all that and let's just Rejoice at this time of the year of God's wonderful gift that he gave everybody the gift of his son what a lovely thing so let us go ahead and stand again this morning and and uh let's sing I love him I love him because he first loved me as brother Matthew comes and opens the Word of Life from the message of the hour and blesses our hearts amen oh love him [Music] because he first L [Music] me [Music] [Applause] and on [Music] let's just sing that again I love him oh [Applause] and love him I love him because he he first love [Music] me and purchase my [Music] salvation of [Music] calar tree amen what time is that Fellowship this evening Pastor I guess maybe maybe we we can start coming up here around 3 or 4:00 or uh if you don't know maybe we'll get that announced but I'm excited about what the Lord has in store for us maybe as they're playing let's just approach him Lord [Music] Jesus we love you this morning because you first loved us and you loved us so much that you gave your your only begotten son and paid the price for our sin and the penalty of death that we might be free this morning in newness of Life resurrected on this Sunday morning able to Worship You Lord in spirit and in truth Lord now we're we're looking to you the author and the finisher of our faith Lord maybe I feel a little bit like that boy that came to the hillside that day with just a couple fishes and a few loaves of bread and he didn't have much but when he placed what he had into your hands it was enough Lord that's my heart's desire we've pinned down just a few notes and Lord in its own it wouldn't be enough but Lord if you would just take it now there will be leftovers Lord that the saints of God can feed on we love you we just commit ourselves we ask that you'd come Lord now and break the bread of Life feed your sheep Lord I pray in your name the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles you'll turn in James chapter 1 amen we just uh before we get started want to um just thank all the helpers and uh the youth leaders and those that came together uh to provide um the Christmas dinner that was for the Youth um so we had a good time I believe did we have a good time we had a good time just coming together and fellowshipping and appreciated what our pastor um shared with the youth um it might not have been um you know it was about 20 25 minutes but if you will meditate on those things could be extremely impactful um that you are not what you think you are and you could you could look at that on both sides of the spectrum that maybe you see yourself through the negative uh but that's not really what you think you are is not really who you are and then even on the positive side the very things that lay in the word of God and the Revelation that we've received of who we are well we're really not who we think we are yet because there's we just just don't even have the capacity that's right in this life to really comprehend what God has made us and so it's just a journey that we're on so we really appreciated that but just reading in our Bibles we'll uh read verse 17 here in the the Book of James chapter 1 it says every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may have your seats every good gift and every perfect gift is from above but I like that next portion of the Scripture it says and cometh down I like like that and cometh down every good gift and every perfect gift comes down amen so if God has a good gift or a perfect gift it's something that God brings down or comes down and he gives to you it Cometh From The Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning and I was just kind of looking at that scripture it says every good gift and every perfect gift and maybe if you're to look into that word good you know what does that even mean every good gift and every perfect gift but one of the things that the word good would mean is something that's useful and we're right now in a in a Christmas time and you know um you want to get someone something good don't you right you know you're always trying to think within yourself what can I get them they already maybe you feel like they have everything and and and maybe you've got them things in the past but you know you start to think within yourself well I want to get them something good I I I want to get them maybe something uh uh that is useful you don't want to give something to to somebody that they really don't need it you know cuz you you want them to be able to to maybe uh uh put it into action or have use of it you know I mean if if if somebody doesn't play football and you buy him a football uh they they might thank you for it but they they really don't have any use for it it's really not any good to them it's it's really not useful so so you want to give somebody something that's good that that can be useful that they can uh put into action maybe something that they can wear or or something that will help them many times you know it comes to the to the uh the season of time you're thinking about something you want to get your mom or or your wife or something that's why moms have maybe 10 or 12 aprons in their jawer and they they have a million spatulas that they don't know what to do with every single one of them but but you're wanting to be thoughtful you're you're wanting to give them something that that can be useful and and so you try to think of something you know they're they're Homemakers and so you try to think of something that you could give them that would help them in and maybe a daily use that would be something uh a good gift you would say something useful so you know uh and that's why around Christmas times you get things that you need I'm sorry kids but you're going to get socks for Christmas because it's useful everybody need socks I'll never forget one time we you know we were we're having our Christmas we were a little younger during them days and and uh we were all gathered around and there were some Believers that had come through town uh conveniently on Christmas Day and and so uh we got to spend Christmas with with some Believers that were passing through and and as we would open our little presence there sitting on the couch and and we would open up and there they were the brother and sister with both arms up on the back of the couch just peering right over our shoulders and and every time we would we would get something I think they were just as surprised as we were and I'll never forget one time we we started to open up the little gift there and uh we opened it up and guess what it was so socks and the brother and sister goes socks what was it it was socks but you know what that's what happens around the Christmas time you you get things you need you you get things like clothes and and socks because maybe maybe you don't think oh my goodness I was expecting a Sega Genesis or well you really don't need that it might be something that you want but many times during this season you're you're wanting to uh uh give something that's good something that's useful something that somebody can put into action that they can they can appreciate it you know and so I want to say if you have a need right if you have a need well many times what happens around has anybody ever been asked what do you want for Christmas well that was a demanding resounding nobody all right so if you didn't know around this time of year we call it Christmas time you know sometimes uh people might ask you what would you like for Christmas and and so that would be your opportunity to say you know what um you know I I have need of this you know you have not because you ask not right and so if somebody's asking you um hey what would you like for Christmas well if you have a need that would be a good time time to say you know what I I I I I I I I need a new shirt for for for for church or I need something for for school I need a tie I need something and then so I would say that maybe when it comes around that time and and maybe a couple gifts have been given to you and you have a need and you've been given a gift it might be a good idea to open up the gift and see what's inside because there's a good chance that the gift will meet the need and the prophet of God would say um in this sermon God's wrapped gift he would say that's the only way anybody in the world will ever know what's in the package it has to be revealed to you you'll turn it down and say it's fanaticism but when you get the Revelation you'll seek for it you'll open up and God will come in and Su with you and you with him when you're ready to open the door let them in that little package Knocking at Your Heart the greatest Christmas gift was ever given the first one and the greatest one that little package knocking at the heart of the man I'll come in and suck you'll never know it until it's revealed to you and when it's revealed to you then you'll go hunting for it I say if you have a need and it's being revealed to you and he's knocking at your heart you open up be go hunting for the very things that God has to offer you that's God's greatest gift to you is that what is the prophet saying that God would knock at your heart and that you you would open up the door and he would come in and Su with you I want to ask you if you have a need in your life this morning if there's something that you're Desiring if there's something that you're hungering for God is here this morning and he's knocking at your heart and if you'll just let him in he said I will come in and S with you oh that is the greatest gift that has ever been given to mankind that God would knock at your heart and that you could open up your heart and the king of glory could come into your heart oh how could the king of glory the creator of heavens and earth the one that fashioned the trees and the mountains and he carved out the Landscapes with the rivers and oh what a great display all over the universe from the little things all the way up to the sky and and and the shining stars and the planets and the Milky Ways and Beyond oh it's past finding out that the God who created all of those things this morning he's knocking at your heart oh it's the greatest gift that man has ever known that God would come in and suck with you Hallelujah you have a need you have something that you want amen the greatest gift oh my it's more it's more than just a good gift a good gift can be something useful yes it can be something temporary I I think of the nine spiritual gifts oh they're wonderful they're gifts of the Spirit right but you know the scripture says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so then just and unjust balum prophesied but yet he wasn't a doer of the word he wanted his own way right did true words proceed out of balam's mouth certainly true words proceeded out of balam's mouth he he prophesied one of the greatest prophecies ever spoken about Israel said a star shall arise out of Jacob and that was the very prophecy that the Magi were following because the word had been spoken but yet in that that gift of Prophecy that balam had or he was not a true word Prophet because he was not a doer of the word I I I I want the perfect gift I want Christ himself in myself I might not be able to do all the work but if I'll open my heart to him Lord I've come short I've fallen short I can't keep all of your ways I can't keep all of your statutes oh but if the the the perfect gift will come in this morning you're knocking at my heart if I'll just let you in if you'll just come into the command Tower if you'll just take control of my life if I can just have communion and if I can just sck with you oh oh gifts are good uhh gifts out in the church are good they're wonderful we need those things Lord but I want more than just a spiritual gift I want the giver I want The Giver of the gift which is the greatest gift which is the perfect gift which is here this morning oh don't let that be far from your heart he's here this morning right now present tense knocking on the door of each one of your hearts I'm wondering will you let them in will you have communion with him will you suck with him that's the time of year that we're living in it's a Christmas season a time of giving and providing for needs you know Humanity goes through great efforts during this time you know they they got their soup kitchens and uh they do their uh toys for HS and the Salvation Army is is is out collecting and they have hope for Humanity and all of these things and these great efforts that's going out because that's the the season it's a season of of of giving and and there's there's so many efforts going out to provide for the needs and you know I asked the question what do you want for Christmas good that's easy I didn't hear a word what do you want for Christmas amen I'll think about it that's okay what what do you what do you want for Christmas you want clothes you want money what do you have need of maybe that's a better question you know the Bible would say that if you ask for something be in prayer believing you shall receive it amen maybe we'll turn there in Matthew 21 Matthew 21 verse 22 says and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive it amen you know as I thought about these things in the Christmas season I thought about this you know we're always wondering what we want I thought what happens we as if we ask God what he wanted I think that's a worthy question Lord what what do you want for Christmas have you ever pondered that what maybe the Lord would want from you maybe what you could even give him I kind of was thinking about that Lord you you've done so much for me and you've done so much for us Lord what what could I do for you and it just come to my heart there uh brother Brandon would would make mention and say well how how do how do we know that he loves us Hallelujah by believing what he said how do we show our love to him by believeing that's what he's asking you to do believe him you want to know what you can do for the Lord what he would ask for you to do this morning believe what he said believe him with all of your heart believe believe on the Lord Jesus believe his word believe believe what he's saying so I ask you what what are you giving him you know we're always asking uh uh what what you can receive but really The Season's about giving it's a time of giving I ask what are we giving unto the Lord what is it that we would have to offer him I know in ourselves we have nothing to offer but oh if we can just offer him our lives and we could offer him our heart if if we could come before him Lord I I I don't have much to give Lord but what I do have Lord I lay it down at your feet Here I Am Lord I I want to Worship You Lord I I want to give you my life Lord I I want to give you of my time and Lord even my efforts and all those things my works oh that's that's meaningless to you Lord but if if I could do anything Lord let me believe you let me take you at your word oh that's his heart's desire that that you would believe him and conduct yourself with joy in the midst of the trials that him and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass if you want to do anything if you want to do something for God I would say let's believe him let's take him at his word so many times we we we come short of taking God at his word he's asking you look try me that's one thing in the Bible he says try me about your tithes I try them some of us maybe are not uh uh uh uh um uh me making in meets like we would like to because we think we're the ones stretching the dollar we we think we're the ones being Frugal we're think we're cutting out coupons and saving all this money and say well I'll just pay my ties next time I say give God first and watch him stretch your dollar oh he can stretch a $1 bill into a million dollar bill if you just put it in his hand say Lord I'm coming to you first Lord I'm placing everything in your hands I don't know how I'm going to make ends me I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent Lord but all I have I give to you and Lord I'm going to take you at your word and I'm going to watch you do battle I want to tell you God's Mighty in battle why don't you watch them work this morning you got something you have need of you got financial problems or you have problems in the home or in your marriage I want to say why don't you put it in God's hands why do you say Lord God you're mighty in battle I'm going to put it in your hands I lay it all in your hands Lord Jesus I'm tired of trying to figure it out on my own I'm trying to pay the bills you quit paying your bills let God pay your bills the problem is is you're relying on your ability and we ain't got no ability that God needs God don't need your ability and he doesn't need your excuses what he needs is a surrendered heart why don't you go ahead and surrender to the greatest love gift that God has ever offered Humanity Jesus Christ wrapped in a manger and he's here knocking on your heart why don't you let them in am why don't you let them in this morning let them in that's okay he's knocking let him in he's he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll provide your needs has anybody been crying out for a need been crying out for something amen you know there's a time in the Bible where Israel had come into bondage and they were crying out for a deliverer they had a need the the their burden was becoming more they they were sick and tired of being whipped they were sick and tired of making bricks for the Egyptians and the scripture says they started to cry out and the cries came up before God Amen all right they had a need they started crying out and what did God do he sent them a deliverer the prophet of God said said that Moses was a gift to Israel do you know it's an amazing thing he would come around and show how that when he came he says the people weren't ready to receive him he said Moses going into the Wilderness for 40 years and the waiting of Israel was not because of Moses see many times when the prophet will take it down on a personal level he'll use Moses as the example and Moses trying to use ability but you come out to the age or to the group because all God always deals with a group of people and he shows how the group he says they The Waiting wasn't on Moses part The Waiting was on Israel's part because they were not ready to receive the very thing they were asking for think about it now now you've been praying you've been asking you've been crying out I wonder if Christ has not been here trying to give you the very thing that you've been asking for but you haven't been ready to receive it my that's a an interesting way to look at it to think that God is here in every Fountain of Life wanting to pour himself into your life Hallelujah into your situation into your heart and the very thing the very waiting it's we're not waiting on God he's here he's here to fulfill his word what we're waiting on is the individual and their heart you hear that what is it it's the greatest gift the greatest gift man has ever received God's love gift amen is that not the greatest gift I I I is is the Son of God not the greatest love gift that God ever gave to humanity now I know you're message Believers I know you love the Bible if anything you can amen that God loves you yes sir he's here for you and sometimes the waiting is is in ourselves where you know what maybe I'm hanging on to something maybe I'm just not sick and tired and sick and tired I'll never forget one time uh before I started serving the lord you know I was I I I was I was I was I I wanted to be delivered and so you know what I did I sighed and cried I I remember driving my pathfinder down the road and and I got out of my my my vehicle and I climbed down in a ditch and I cried out before God and I wanted to be delivered because I really didn't like being in bondage but I kind of liked the effects of it I I cried out for God but you know I really wasn't ready to give it up I kind of was still holding on to some things cuz sometimes you know we we give into indulgences and we give into certain things and a and and and we feel condemned and and really what we don't like is we don't like the the conviction we don't like how it makes us feel dirty so we want that go to go away but but that really you know there's a part of us that you know we kind of like it so we go through Cycles we we you know we get under conviction and and and you know we you know it's time I I'll clean up my life and and you know what I really want to be delivered and and so then you you feel good you made a step in the right direction but but you know what happens just just it just takes a little bit of time and all of a sudden that that one little step here and that one little step there and all of a sudden you wonder why you're starting to to do the same things you used to do and I realized that I had I had I had cried out to God but but God was waiting on me he wasn't I wasn't waiting on God lord here I am I'm ready to receive the Holy Ghost and if you'll just hurry up the program here you said oh no no that's not the God we serve but I want to tell you when you're ready yes to lay it all down Hallelujah your Ambitions your dreams your college the boy you like the girl you like the makeup the earrings the smoking the drugs your pet doctrines your favorite preacher whatever it is when you're find finally ready to get to the place to say you know what I don't need to be popular I don't need to be revered by my peers I don't need anybody to think I'm anybody I I you know I I I I I I I don't I don't need to be successful in this world I I thought I needed a a career and I thought I needed to buy a car and I I thought I needed to do all these things Lord but really they're just taking me further away from you Lord I'm ready to lay it all down lord I I I haven't been waiting on you but but you've been waiting on me and and you've been knocking at my heart this whole time you've been wanting to come in and sck with me and and be the greatest gift that perfect gift that would provide for all the needs that I've been running after amen you come to that place and I came to that place one time where I had had enough and I made a move for God and he made a move move for me he was knocking on my heart and I said Lord come in I'm ready Lord I don't want anything of this world and the greatest gift what the gift of himself the gift of the Holy Ghost the gift of eternal life could come in that's exactly what Moses was doing for the the children of Israel is it was God's gift to take the people out of the condition that they were in now now just follow for a moment we're just trusting in the leadership of the Holy Ghost if you could uh stay with us for a few more moments but the very thing that they had need of the prophet of God said that God came down and was going in the form of a man amen so it was the very messenger that God sent to the church to provide the needs of the people right that the children of Israel they needed Deliverance they were under taskmasters uh you know they were under Creeds and dogmas and they were they were under the rulership of man and they were crying out for deliverance so what did God do God sent them a gift in the form of a prophet to provide the needs that they had needed they said Lord I need to be deler I need a change I need you to come on the scene and so the very thing that they were praying for came in the form of the Prophet Moses think of it now now sometimes the waiting is all because we are not recognizing what God has provided for the need W that's right you you you want healing you want Deliverance you want salvation you want justification you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want a body change you want a body change I don't know about you but I want a body change I want to get out of here well if those are the things that you're praying for if those things are the things that you're Desiring look God has provided us a message he's provided us a prophet that brought the Word of Deliverance that could take us into all those things and meet the need that we have I hope you're following me there that's what Israel was crying out for but they weren't ready to receive it but I would say to you this morning accept his gift he knew you before the foundation of the world he knew what you had need of let the gift take care of it that would be my thought to you this morning let the gift take care of it you know God has given you the greatest gift that you could ever have and sometimes God's gifts comes in different forms the Son of God was wrapped in swallowing claws in a Manger it didn't look like the greatest gift if we were all gathering around and we were judging this one we would say that's the best he gots all the the that's it I mean the you're telling me the creator of heavens and earth and and the greatest gift he could ever give to mankind is I is a baby wrapped in stinky Linens in in a in a barn oh but see it takes Revelation to really know what's there and friends I want to tell you we need God to give us a revelation of this message it has to be wrapped that's right to you individually and to you personally for you to start understand the value for you to start to understand the importance for the needs that are in your life when the message of the hour starts to become a revelation and you realize that things start falling off of your life and and questions you had all of all of your life they become to become answered and the Victory you wanted over shortfalls and besetting sins you start to get Deliverance why because it's in the gift that God has provided but we got to unwrap it it it has to be revealed oh on the outside it it might not look like much it might have looked like a a Kentucky hillbilly that that had come with no education but oh if you could understand what was behind the gift wrapping it was God veiling himself inside of a man God had come down every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from the Father of Lights I don't want to say that God has come down Hallelujah right right in an age that had the greatest need there was the greatest Darkness the world had gone into complete apostasy there seemed like there was no hope but God by Divine promise came down I want to say it was the greatest gift this age had ever seen that God would Veil himself in the ministry of the son of man that could discern the thoughts and intents of your heart and he could meet your need oh if you could just look past the Veil Hallelujah and see Jesus Christ standing before you the same yesterday today and forever but many people don't want it because of the gift wrapping could you imagine getting a gift and be like nah I ain't going to open that I don't want to open that why don't you want to open it's just Brown it looks like cardboard well I mean why don't you just go ahead and open up and look inside no no I already looked at it it doesn't matter that's my ecclesiastical ideas oh my it's not it's not glittering and glamouring it ain't screaming and shouting like I want it to you know I just don't really you know it just doesn't really catch my attention Okay well yeah if that's how you feel about it there he is the savior of the world laying there in a Manger but before you pass judgment so quick how many of you try to guess what's inside the package you get it you shake it you ever guessed right you just know what it is some people know it is you know that's what a lot of people have done they have taken the message they just shake it around yeah yeah it sounds like that sounds good I can serpent seed water baptism m 45 yeah you know this all sounds good I like it packing around I got the message I got the message of the hour yep God sent a prophet yeah can you believe that think of all the signs and the Wonders and everything yeah that was done around the world seven times the first pull the second pull all those things you're not telling the Pentecostals anything they don't already know some of them MERS go around talk to them they'll tell you about the meetings they'll tell you about the power they'll tell you about all those things but you know one thing they never did they never unwrapped the gift that's right it was never revealed to them that's right cuz one time I was fellowship with a a Pentecostal Pastor i' been pastoring for years and he was familiar with the ministry and and so when I got to that place I started to tell him he said he said oh he looked at me and with his with his eyes set he said oh son but you what you need to know is at the end of his ministry he got off and something spoke to he said no sir you got off because it was a train that was bound for Glory it was God's gift to take us out of this war torn wretched generation that had crucified our Lord Jesus Christ for the second time oh but behind the veil it was none other than Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he was taking you somewhere but if you never open it up if you never get the real Revelation and actually allow the message of the hour to come into your heart discern your life everything you have need of is in this revealed word I say it in everything you have need of is in the revealed word of the I want to ask you what are you asking for this morning what do you have need of I want to say is it your family is it your son is it your daughter is it your marriage is everything I want to tell you I want to tell you everything you have need of is right here what we need is the [Applause] Revelation if we could cry out what we should cry out more than ever before is the revelation of what God has given you ever been given a gift I don't even know how to operate this thing have you you don't you love those GI you buy your daughter something it's a dollhouse you roll that thing out I'm like wait a second 682 steps I needed I need the engineer to come put this thing together oh I can't even begin I can't even but you know what you got to do just start with step one everybody wants to jump to step 682 we just want to step over all the steps here I am bless God I'm the bride ready for a body change no why don't you just start right there on your knees say Lord I can't do nothing without you holding my hand i'm needy Lord I have needs I I see a picture in your word it's it's a big beautiful house I know there's a Promised Land beyond the river in my father's house or many mansions if I would not have told you so but I go and prepare a place for you that that where I am you may be also something your hearts longing for it you're getting a little picture of the word but well we got to start there and repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen oh the greatest gift and now if you'll just start supping in communion with him well how do we do that brother Matthew well you got the Bible and you got the revealed word of the hour to make this come a reality amen friends if you haven't figured it out God has giving you the key in this hour without Malachi 4:5 we're all probing we're all wondering we're all looking to what man can explain it the best and how he can trace it down through the scriptures and then we'll have a group meeting and we'll vote on who we think is right but God bypassed all of man's theology he just like it was in the Garden of Eden when his children had a need he said I'm gonna come down myself Hallelujah God knew this bride needed a fresh word of Revelation and he didn't just leave it to a man but he said I will come down myself because every good gift and every perfect gift cometh down from the father of lights and according to Divine promise God has come down and spoken lip to ear through the profit of the hour to his bride that you might receive his word that you might receive everything that you have need of if we'll just take step one and start walking in the light of the hour oh if you walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ shall cleanse you from all your sins oh what a gift what a gift and that gift is here knocking at your heart will you open up will you receive it why don't you let the gift take care of it remember we're asking you now what is the need that you have what is it that's is on your heart what are you going through you know many times sometimes your situation could so complex you don't even know what you need you just know you need something like I I I can't even fix this I mean I can't undo what I did and I can't do something else to undo and you feel stuck is there a gift for that brother Matthew Hall I feel stuck this morning I I I don't I don't know to turn to the left I don't know to turn the right I I feel like I can't back up but I sure I sure can't go forward is there something brother Matthew is there something is there a gift for me I want to say there's a gift for you not just a good gift there's a perfect gift for you like that woman one time and out cast from society couldn't draw water with the other maidens because she'd made a mess of her life she tried to fix it and tried to let somebody else fix it it just seemed like it was making it worse and worse and worse but the The Good The Perfect Gift said I have needs to go by Samaria amen I have the need to go by bed for Texas this morning because I have a son or a daughter that I need to go visit and there she was drawing at that well and there he says woman can you give me a drink she didn't recognize the gift that was sitting before amen she couldn't quite understand the presence think of it now what was there some Supernatural presence that was some aura that was emulating from him in such a way was he just withholding her from knowing alls I know is it was just a regular Sunday morning just going about her regular business just had a need of of water so she went as other times down to the well but little did she know this morning was different this morning was different because the greatest gift the perfect gift was sitting there and think of the discourse that starts to happen well it's not customary for you to talk to me this man doesn't even know my past oh woman not only does he know your past he knows your [Applause] future I could say oh the greatest thing I could say is not only did he know your past that he could erase it all yes but he knew your future that's the real message to you is your future that's right am he said oh if you would know who you were talking to you would ask me for a drink Hallelujah now think about her condition I would ask you for a drink you're not even prepared oh my you don't even have the gift or the ability to give me a drink you know how many times men will come behind the pulpit and we just look at them like you give me a drink oh my I mean goodness gracious I know more than I'm more equipped than he is oh who are you are you greater than our father Jacob well what about that he said you had asked me for a drink and I would give you living water that you might never thirst again oh you know what that sounds like to me that sounds like a perfect gift oh not just a good gift socks are good but they wear out yes the nine spiritual gifts are good the outpouring is good we need it it's the promise but it's like the wind right it comes and it goes but a perfect perect gift Hallelujah that gift it'll never wear out it'll never grow old you shall never thirst [Applause] again give me this water I want that water hallelu give me that water you're telling you you can give me socks that never we out come on a bank account that never runs dry are you hearing what he's offering it's easy for us to connect in the natural so let's connect in the natural you got a blank check to every car dealer in DFW whatever car you want to drive if you want to drive a different one every hour every day whatever it is go on down you can take your pick every Bank in Dallas Fort Worth your name is there and when you look up your balance it says Eternal give me that water hey if you can catch oh my the prophet was not given a history lesson the story he told more than any story in the Bible was the woman at the wh not because it was his favorite story he was the story the story was unfolding and being reenacted to the Gentiles he was that man saying if you knew like that little girl that wanted to see the Healer right bumped into him if you'll get me in there I'm he that's speaking to you if you are ask me oh are you the Healer I'm here oh if if you just pray for me I'll find my own daddy oh that was more than a good gift that's right that was more than a man oh I think too many of us are still looking at the rapper you're still looking at titles of books there's a man here that can turn on the light a good thought Look Away to Jes oh that's a really good thought we got to get away from this ecclesiastical nonsense and we got to recognize the person of the word standing in our midst just like he was standing there at the well he's standing here this morning Discerning the thoughts and intents of the art if you'll just open up your heart let them in I'll come in I'll meet you in there the third pool the reveal word of the hour where are we at we got a Bible scripture 10 410 here she is she's sitting there but you know it's amazing how God is he starts to do things in such a way where many times we don't even realize what starts to happen but you start to turn a corner it's like you're in darkness and a little beat of light comes through and gets your attention you're like what's that huh what what is that over there and Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God hallelujah oh Hallelujah if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me a drink right thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water now if you go on to the next verse the woman sath un them sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from which then hast thou that Living Water next verse art thou greater than our father Jacob oh if you art thou greater than just a Prophet come on art thou greater than just a gift of Prophecy art thou greater oh I'll stop right there because it needs to be God yes to reveal it Hallelujah a man could stand in the Pulpit for 45 years and declare to you the coming of the Lord that Christ has come down that he is here and it'll go right over your heads if you don't pray that God revealed to it personally who this really is a greater than Solomon is here there is a man here that can turn on the light and his name is Jesus oh ye Look Away to Jesus why is he telling you to look because he's here because he's turned on the light amen are you greater than our father Jacob which gave us this well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and sent her whosoever drinketh of this water run down to that corner run down to this corner hop online and stream this and stream that come on you're going to be thirsty come on come on and you're going to be so thirsty you'll thirst for

more knowledge 15 the woman saith unto him ha looks like Christmas time to me there you go looks like Christmas time well you have not because you ask not you come in day in and day out and you go out without it come on maybe the reason you ain't got it is because he's waiting on you Hallelujah you know it's it's really hard it's really hard here here we're going to do this come here Phillip hold that for me all right take this oh that okay hold on take this all right here man this guy's good take this take this for the sake of the display can you take anything else say no all right here Phillip take this hey that that reminds me of the woman that came to Jesus come on just keep there that's great see how long he can do it that reminds me of the woman that came to Jesus he she she came to him approached him say oh oh I have a need right yeah well it's not it's not meat it's not meat I I can't I can't give you a full course meal she said all right well Lord now she came with the right approach if if I can just hold it with my pinky Lord if it's just a little scrap right I'll take whatever you give me but he wants to give you more than that when you come with the right of proor analogy take this you can't just remember that it's like we're asking the Lord Lord can you please give me this this and this and he's over here trying to give it to you and you're just holding everything but if you'll just finally start laying it down to say Lord you know what I've been holding way too much stuff I'm ready to lay it all down here is the revealed word of the hour why don't you take this then you can grab thank you then you can grab a hold of it but the problem is we're holding on to too many ideas we're holding on to too much uh intellectual thinking we're holding on look we I tell you what message people have become really good theologians that's right that's right I mean we're the best best of the best you want to talk about a sadducee and a Pharisee we can we can clean a cup and a pot cleaner than anybody could ever clean it yeah I'm a message believer look at me you can't tell me nothing I've heard the seven Thunders I am I am and you are not anything like our Lord was that's right Meek lowly riding on a Don yes oh because sometimes when you don't have the giver inside you don't have anything to give oh and that's something oh my we we all we all want it all we want to do all the works we want to we want to toot our horn we want to be message Believers we want to push all the denominations and all the Pentecostals below us oh no that's not never one thing our Lord did right he was there to seek and save that was lost think of Acts now think of think of I believe it was Peter at the gate called Beautiful talking about a need right here comes Peter he said Silver and Gold Have I None but the need that you have I got the need I got the need meter right here inside of me Silver and Gold hav't on you don't need silver and gold but that which I have it's way a worth more than silver and gold it's worth more than an education it's worth more than a good job it's worth more than a good car it's worth more than a good house that which I had rise up Peter had something to give why because the giver he had received the greatest gift what does our text say the Father of Lights yes yes ye are the light of the world so where is the light of this word now it is in the bride you are the light of the world you have something to give right but if you find yourself empty if you feel like there's something they're not to give back to our text the woman said to him give me this water I wonder if we can just come to this portion in the service is somebody with a sincere heart during this Christmas season could say Lord give me this water hallelu I'm thirsty Lord tired of running up this heal tired of feeling unworthy I'm I'm tired of the scars I'm tired of the her I'm I'm going feel like I'm going crazy would you give me a drink Lord that I thirst not I have to be reminded every day of my past every day I I come to this place I'm reminded of my mist takes cuz I I can't be like other women next verse Jesus said un her go call thy husband and come hither oh the next verse you can see the woman answered and said I have no husband it's good to be honest with God a lot of people stay in their condition because of pride right oh yeah I I've I've I I just told the man that I'm a Believer I just told the man that my father's Jacob if he finds out that I'm a transgressor of the law what will he really think of me maybe I should just claim the one I my my recent maybe I'll do this maybe I'll do that oh no I don't have a husband Jesus said un her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband and that said us thou truly and the woman said to him sir Hallelujah I perceive that thou art a prophet Hallelujah next verse our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto her woman what is he requiring believe me Hallelujah if you knew the gift of God that was in your mxed I say un you woman I say un you Church believe me right the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh I like this right here but the hour cometh and now is stop looking for something far off to come he's already here he he has already come down Christ The Mighty Angel has come down he put one foot on the land one foot on the sea he took an open book and he called out your name I have needs to go by Samaria I have needs to go by bed for Texas woman if you knew who it was that was talking to you you had ask of me for a drink but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such yes oh my the father seeketh such I think I might know I know a little bit what the Lord might like want for Christmas he wants somebody to believe him for what he said and if you truly believe him right it becomes a revelation and that Revelation becomes a worship oh because he seeks those to worship Him in spirit and in truth oh my and now is when the true worshipper next verse God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth 25 the woman said to him I know that when Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us

balam how did he think that God wouldn't wouldn't curse a people like Israel but he failed to see he looked at the swaddling cloth instead of seeing the smitten Rock and the brass serpent that was going before them to make an atonement so it is today instead of seeing the power of the Holy Ghost doing his signs of the Messiah and the Wonders among the people as he promised he would do in the last days as he said as it was in the days of lot so will it be at the coming of the son of man when he begins to do those signs and wonders amongst the people showing himself alive what is it amongst
