Description:
Don't Be Caught Between Two Prophecies
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service: November 15th,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Lord when we think of all the promises that you've made us than how you promised that you'd never leave us you'd never forsake us no matter how dark it gets father you you said you'd remain faithful and that you would love us to the end and oh Father we just rest in that this morning we ask you to bless us this morning as we just have a time of fellowship and just trust that you know the needs of each heart this morning and that you'll reach out and you'll touch each heart this morning we ask it in Jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen amen God bless you this morning let's go ahead and open our Bibles and and uh we let's turn to uh Revelations uh the thir chapter and let's just remind ourselves this morning as we uh read the scriptures uh uh concerning the age that we're living in and we certainly uh are grateful to have those of you that have come out to the house of the Lord this morning uh those that are uh uh streaming or watching online I know we have a few uh in in the morning uh we certainly uh miss you we want you to know that we miss you it seems some I haven't seen since April I guess it's been a long time and and U just hard to believe huh that it's actually things have gotten like this but uh we're going to be victorious amen that's the thing so let's read in Revelations the 3r chapter and we'll start with the 14th verse and uh it says and unto the angel of the Church of L oia write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art glute war and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire that thou mayest be rich and white renant that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear and anoint thine eyes with IAB that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will will I grant to sit with me in my Throne Lord even as I also overcame am in set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the Lord out his blessings to his word Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated uh this is uh certainly a uh as we know that this is certainly a great uh scripture reading that is so uh so directed to a certain group of people and to a certain time and uh you know it it's wonderful that you can take the word of God this morning and know that God could so have such a comprehension and being the author and the finisher of our faith to have such uh a reach uh of being omnipresent and omnipotent and all knowing that he could take the things of the word of God and actually lay out out in the scripture uh the word of God for every Age and and leave us with instructions and and yet in speaking it all and writing it all through the scriptures and as the scripture tells us in diverse Times by diverse manners God through His prophets that he spoke to us but yet be able to seal it up in a way that it could lay there and it be written and written just for you with your name on it you know where it wouldn't fit for no other age no other time it's got your name on it it's just like it was packaged and wrapped with your name on it just for you and it was it was sent and when when you got here in your life the word of God arrived and you were able to open it up and you say well how was it packaged it was packaged in Revelation that's how it was packaged it was it was something that had to be unfolded to you had to be opened up it it had to be shown you and that's how you know that it's uh yours is that he puts your name on it and he shows it to you and said this is what I got for you and this is uh you know the scriptures it's a gift to us this morning I mean it it's beautiful so just think of these things that we have it it's the Lord warning us of what we have to be careful of in this day and you know and it it's something about God God's not a respector of persons you know uh there's there's not a different gospel written for different groups of people people from different countries it's it's not written by region there's not a gospel for for the Southern Hemisphere and a gospel for the Northern Hemisphere there's not a gospel for the western United States and the eastern United day the gospel is the same Eternal Word of God that came from the beginning and because of that because of that that that God so loved the world it didn't say he so loved a part of the world he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so we're all able to come under the the great word of God so the word of God was given to those who have an ear to hear amen and and so uh and so he he he just so beautifully spoke these things and and he warns us he warns us in this age that we're living in of a great complacency that was going to come on the people if I could sumon Up This Way Lady oia is an attitude it it it's what it is it's a it's people's rights it's a it's kind of an attitude that that that science and education was going to develop so he warned us and and this is the first warning I'd like to uh just point out this morning that we want to just talk to to us about this morning in our sun school it's he says write these things the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation I Know Thy Works yes sir that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot amen so so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now what a what a a I'm I'm glad to hear that you know what I mean I I want to know what is expected of me I want to know what God is concerned about and then he says because Thou Art uh you you're rich and you increase with goods and you say I have need of nothing so we start to see the things that the Lord wants to uh point out to us that we have to be aware of we have to be aware of the fact that we we can get into the place that we say I don't have need of anything I I've got it in other words if I could place it like this there's not a hungering and a thirsting and there's not not a calling in other words the longing in your heart for more of God and and more Revelation and more understanding and a greater increase in the things of God you get to the place and and I know I've been talking on these lines over and over again but you get into a place that because of the educational system and things and the fact that you have such increase with knowledge yes sir and increase with Goods what an age that we increase with knowledge isn't it and you begin and you begin to to to see that uh that this great increase in in everything that's presented to you that that hunger and that thirst begins to subside and and the Lord is warning us now be careful yes sir that that great deep that wants to call to the deep that great thirst for the things of God that great hunger for for more of God be careful when you see that starting to subside when when there's something else satisfying that when uh there something else is fulfilling uh your hunger and uh you know the that's the world has all kinds of those things that that if you drink this it helps Subs take away your appetite and or you you take this and it helps give you energy and you got they got all these supplements and all these substitutes and everything and so the spirit in our age is warning us that when you get to this age lady oia you're going to be in an age with much increase and and you're going to be in an age where the there's a spirit of to be lukewarm sir or to be caught in the middle and if I if I would had a a title this morning uh I I would kind of the thought would I want to share with you this morning is don't be caught in between two prophecies don't don't be caught in between two prophecies this morning and so we we know that we know that there are two great spirits do we all understand that see that's the whole thing about lady oia is that Satan just kind of Blends in he kind of just gets out of the picture now he's he he's covered up but we have a prophecy yes sir that tells us that there would be a kingdom Rise Up The Prince and power of the air The Prince and power of this Earth we understand that in these great uh this great battle that started in the beginning and and came down to earth this great war that started we understand that there's two sides there's only two spirits that control the Earth the spirit of God and the spirit of Satan amen there's only two Powers no matter how they dress themselves up no matter how they present themselves there's only two things that are working and and can you imagine the vanity of man that he thinks he's so independent and so smart and so free that he he doesn't even realize that he's under the control of one of these two Powers that's the deception we know that we that we're told in the scriptures that we live in perilous times sir that perilous time shall come that men should be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so all these things have been spoken out to us all these things have been prophesied to us all these things have been told us about this uh about these two things so we know that there there's two sides if I could say it one is the side of the enemy and we call that side we call it the God of this evil age and Satan's Eden okay so we know this in in our scripture reading today we know it was the Church of Lady oia the lukewarm church that didn't feel that they had need of nothing and so each of these each of these things were uh uh prophesied uh to us and and told us what was going to transpire now so I'd like to just read as I if I I could hear uh uh to understand so each of these things and and first of all I want to take Satan's side okay so s is God he wanted to build an Eden he saw what God built he looked at it and he said no there's more to this you know what I mean he he he had a a a okay he had an ambition something that he wanted to achieve so on one side we have Satan's ambition okay he's a power you understand he's an influential power that he's trying to achieve something so he's trying to preach something he's trying he's got something that he wants to offer that he wants us to buy into to join up to to become part of so he was the first salesman you know what I mean and so he he went to Eve and he began to sell her and and and talk to her and and and and try to explain to her she he she said she well he told me not to partake of this fruit of this tree of Good and Evil and he said oh yeah the reason he does that because if you partake of this you will become like gods and Eve listened to him but her failure was is that she believed his lie as God's truth God made a simple statement the day that you eat thereof is the day that you will die in other words there's a something that comes along with this fruit there's something that comes along with with knowledge this tree of Good and Evil the knowledge of tree of Good and Evil so there's something that comes along with the benefits if I could say that of knowledge and of Science and of education and of civilization if you want to take this path to to have all this great science open up to you all this great intelligence open up to you if you want to go down this road where you can have Technologies and and you can do things that you couldn't even imagine of doing can you imagine Adam standing here on the earth and in his beautiful kingdom of Eden and and Satan knowing I can take you and shoot you to the Moon I mean what an achievement I can I've got things I I I see cities oh you don't think so he offered them he offered the kingdoms to Jesus he had a vision of what he was trying to accomplish he had a he knew what he was trying to achieve he saw the great great society and the great buildings and the great science and the great internet and the great things that man could do if they would just eat yeah of this science and of this knowledge sir it was right there yeah Satan saw it all he saw all that man could do everything that he could accomplish all the things that they could achieve and do there was only one problem death came with that it was there but Satan in his vanity he thought he could overcome death he thought eventually he could medical himself out of it he could he could scientifically come to the research and the things to get it and and we hear it all the time people that want to to freeze their body or something and and save it and tell I want to go home that's right could you imagine some poor soul being froze back in 1920 or something and thaw out today and coming in this world what a disappoint appointment yeah that's right what a disappointment but you have to understand this is what that he he thought he saw all these great things that he wanted to do all this great vastness that that that was available but God knew that was there yeah but he knew that those wages and the wages of sin and the wages of science and the wages of civilization and the wages of knowledge was death and man has been dying ever since I there there's one record of one that overcame death and whoever believed on him he would give them the same life that he had to overcome death that's right so we find this great Kingdom's raised here and the wages of that kingdom is death and this what he says it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took 2third of the stars of Heaven ascended himself above those stars and preached to them and deceived 2third of them you see it notice it's his ambition now how is he ready with his carful selected educated bride by his own knowledge see all painted up in his deceit of big buildings and big denomination and paints of knowledge and Theology and smart intellectual educated to deceive the whole world and become a God that's what he's done all headed up into the person of the Antichrist which is already crowned the Vicor of God by his worldly loving scientific bride all dressed up in palp of intellectual religious education she is made religious like him by his own interpretation of the word of God as he did Eve and his son Cain now that's pretty straightforward isn't it cuz anybody have any problem with that that's where we're at we're living in his Eden he is the God of this evil age that's what he wanted to uh uh obtain and we look at the things we've got you know just can you imagine a man sitting there and like he said he's in a horse and buggy and then well and then they came up and and and they developed a Springs and a carriages and and things like that and then he had the stage coach and oh that was even better you know what I mean and then one day they came up with the automobile and uh how would you like it if out here that if we all came to church this morning and carriages and horses there' be a little different Aroma around the place the deacons would have a whole another job that that they would do you know what I mean cleaning the parking lot and and so there'd be a lot of other things that would go on but we advanced right we Advanced and so we look back and we say wow we've come from this that's great this is great yeah you remember the good old days all these stories you know we my us kids we used to say to my mom and dad I know Mom you walked in the snow 50 miles to school yeah you know what I mean we lived in California you know and so it was always you don't remember you know and uh uh and it it's just that's the way it is we we look back and we see we've come forward we've come forward this is great and and we get caught up in that you understand we get caught up in all the new things and all the stuff that's offered us and and and and boy this is great uh you know uh we can fly instead of drive and that's that's great and and now of course we know that they they shot Rockets up and and by doing that they're able to put satellites up there and now you can take your phone I guess if you wanted to and go out in the parking lot and you could call your mom back home somewhere wherever she's at and you can see her and what is that that's great wow I like this this is wonderful and and people people just got everything they want I'm not against technology the technology in itself is just the education of what Satan had to offer amen but it's what that it's doing that's the [Music] poison you understand it's satisfying the Hunger for More Of God it it it satisfies The Thirst and the hunger a and the desire for what does God have so Satan obviously he had he had what he wanted to achieve he wanted to achieve a scientific educational system a system where he could continually educate you and provide you you with science and knowledge and Technology he could always keep the carrot in front of you and and keep offering you better this and more Comfort this my goodness now you can go out and get a mattress that will just fit you so perfect that you just lay down you sleep forever everything pillows mattresses super blankets you know super this super that prophet of God yeah church let me tell you something a prophet's word is the Viewpoint of God that's right he's how God sees it that's what he's telling you he's telling you what God sees he comes up and preaches a message he says super sign everything's super super super improved yeah right everything's super everything's improved but what we've got to come to the realization of what's got to become a strike to us what's got to inspire us is that this is having an effect on your spiritual appetite it's suppressing the appetite for things of God that's true because they don't mix yes sir you have to give up one come on to obtain the other you can't you you you and that's what he said I I I would rather that you would give up one and take the other yes sir Lord but don't mix it and so this age that we're living in was prophesied to us amen we are we are realizing it more now of the things that our messenger that came and and you know with all my heart I believe that God promised that he would send this generation a prophetic message from above am that he was not going to let this church his elected children drift into the grips of the lady oan devil and be totally deceived and totally caught up at and their minds completely saturated with his lies and not do something that's right yeah that's right he wouldn't do it so he sent a voice amen and the voice began to prophesy yes that's what it did it begin to tell us this would happen this would happen as you all know that and I it it's everybody's been texting it back to one another and talking about it but the prophet of God has had a vision and he in this Vision he saw a great woman rise up in the United States he said it's either the Catholic Church a woman president or a woman vice president and by all accounts of how everything's going it appears that that will be fulfilled no you're actually seen something that was prophesied actually coming to pass pass but it comes to pass in such a climate in such confusion and such controversy and people taking sides I'll tell you a good message we all need to sink ourselves into is taking sides with [Applause] Jesus and and so here's the prophecy coming to pass but it's in such a political climate in such a controversial climate such again they're trying to tie all kinds of things to it race to it economy to it sickness to it all this stuff that we fail to see that we've just had thus sayith the Lord come to pass right in our eyes and we heard it but if he's taking the appetite away then that doesn't stimulate you you we become so stimulated by his technology and by his education and by his science and by by all the sensationalism that he offers the World by all the pleasure he offers the World by all these uh uh Ammon uh Ammon and technology and these games oh don't get caught up in games that's a whole five hour sermon right there and and so here the word of God comes to pass and it yeah that's what he said why did he say it why did he prophesy it what's the other side of the prophecy I don't want to be caught in between two prophecies how many think I I I I don't know someone was going to text it to me but I I forget what message it's in but brother M talks about he says you know they'll put on masks and they and it it won't do any good I wish I had that to read forgive me for not getting that but he just says it right out he says you watch are they're going to put on mask and they're going to try disease everywhere and it's not going to do any good it happens we're sitting there but does it does it strike the deep that ought to be calling for the Deep you understand is it hitting a spot inside us that should be resurrecting Within us the hunger for what is it why was this prophesied what's the other side of the prophecy he told us that perilous times would come he told us that men would be lovers of pleasure way back in the scripture and now our Prophet comes along he told us I mean remember when he said there'd be an egg-shaped car oh everybody thought the Volkswagen well the Volkswagen was an egg shaped car that ought have stimulated us wow that was fulfilled then he said he saw people sitting in a car playing games and the cars were driving themselves I've been in people's cars they pull up they press a button and the car Parks itself how many knows that got driverless technology what did that do to you did it throw you into your closet and say oh God prophecy's being fulfilled there this is there's prophecy going on this is exactly what what was told to me yeah but see Satan's always got his Eden Fanfare around it oh this is wonderful driving down the road you don't have to drive and we get caught up into his story line we get caught up into his what he's offering we get caught up into how good it is well how smart it is what a beautiful technology is but remember there's always something attached to it death and Jesus said don't worry about him that can destroy the body but worry about him who can destroy the soul look you you have a messenger that comes down and under inspiration you say did Brother benam know everything that he said I I know one thing I don't know that cuz I never sat and talked with him but I know he believed everything he said and that many times it was none other than God speaking right out through him and prophesying to us and telling us what lied ahead in other words the son of predition was totally revealed and the path that he was taking his world on was prophesied to us that he was taking this world down a scientific educational knowledge age and that's what he was going to lead them into where they put their trust in science and an education and instead of God but the best thing he can do is try to put something on us that suppresses even the need for God don't need them this is a just let me let me read this other thing to you I mean this is uh see if I can find it here real quick it's uh he says look at God will judge this nation someday with fire he'll sink it beneath the ocean the hour of his judgment is at hand the whole world will go religious perversion human perversion men don't even know what sex they belong to neither does women no that was a prophecy yes sir now I might as well just preach right we're just family here so now what they have today in the schools is what they call the gender unicorn let me tell you something you parents if you send your kids to public school you do not let them bring a textbook into your house without you looking at it you find out what they're teaching you ask your kids what did you learn today what today don't you get so lazy that you quit raising those kids the gender unicorn so they got this little unicorn there which is a lie in itself but anyway and they say okay you have the mind you have the heart and you have the natural and they said now what makes what you are is all three parts do you think like a boy or man or do you think like a woman that's one the second is do you feel and then the other is what your natural birth origin was but the natural birth origin is not what determines whether you're man or female it's whether all three of those wow they're teaching this they're teaching this the word of God says God made them male and female and they're looking right back up at him with Science Education psychology all this other scientific stuff and saying no we've created another one nonbinary that they can wait until they've know what's in their mind and their heart and then they can make whatever changes that they need to make what did he call it he called it human perversion you understand he said now this is prophecy it was prophesied that the world would get to a place where they would be so have such a human perversion that they couldn't discern whether they're man or woman I don't got a medical degree but I can tell the difference between a man and a woman that's right can you imagine how far but that isn't the problem the problem's not where they're at the problem is where what effect is where they are having on you is it making you lukewarm see you can get caught up on one side of the prophecy and then you're stuck between them there's there there's there's hundreds of these little things that brother brandom said to us that if you have ear to hear that they start clicking here's just another little one listen to this one he's talking about Alvis meaning Ricky and Ricky meaning cat he says you never heard such names as that in the Bible or in any other age it's the age names for this age there ever there ever was a perverted rats and cats it's there it's the these are the names for the age we never seen these like I said uh I'm just going to preach it he said you never seen names like that in the Bible but these are names for this age we got all kinds of names out there I don't want to even name them because uh there'll probably be somebody named that but all kinds of worldly names off of stars and and movie stars and athletes and people go to name books well I got a name book and they dig up all these names just because somebody else tells you it means something but he said there's names for this age but you see that that whole process of how important a name is it's slipped out of our thinking we don't pray over how what we're going to name our kids we don't think what effect will this name have on their life see it they accept any old name any old title any old name any old name you come up with is fine but he said there's names for this age and I don't know them all but I do have I do have a little guideline here that I think is so beautiful he said you never heard such names as that back in the Bible I like that I can't discern any name I can't to find out if you know if your name's rouille or or whatever it is that that's fine but I know one thing I got a prophet that said there's that you didn't find names like that in the Bible yeah well it gives me a good guideline and I don't know what your names are there's only one name I'm really important is and that's the name you have that's on the Lamb's Book of Life all this other name will go away but I'm just trying to point out to the fact that we get caught on one side of the prophecy everybody wants some sort of unique name everybody's trying to being so individual and they're missing the real individuality which is the individuality of your affair with Christ Jesus so he said look at that he says there ever was a perverted rats and cats at here all this million dooll disc jockeys there was no million dooll dis jockeys back then yeah but now there is they take a record and they go and and that's music well I finally figured out there's an instrument I can play a scratched record million dooll dish jockeys yeah and these kids walking out here can't even go to school without a thing sticking in the ear oh you found that but there it is here it is don't you see it prophecy fulfill what effect is it having on you remember this is the age that they'll become dull of hearing they it won't shake them nothing prophet of God said you could take he talk about that little baby in the store and her mama took it up and shook something in and began to scream and cry and he couldn't figure it out and that's what he said that's what happened to the church God's dangled every gift everything in front of their face and they won't move now we're seeing every prophecy everything that he's spoken coming to pass oh okay they want me to put that up there if you have it they got my mask quote to me see technology I mean I got to stop what I'm preaching and show you this anyway is it up there it is all right now some of them say well now if the plague Falls we'll just go in the hospital if the plague happens to fall you know what I'll do we'll go get Dr Jones he'll know how to take care of it it didn't work yet they were smart well if the plague Falls we'll just go down beneath the ground in a cave and shut the door down it won't do it one bit of good we'll stay in the house and put a mask over our face and put some disinfectant on it didn't do a bit of good my goodness thus saith the [Applause] Lord I mean God made a provided way yes and what was what the blood God provided it as as simple as it seems to take the blood of the lamb and sprinkle the post yet God said that was his way and he honored it all out from under the blood die so we see the prophecy all these things have come to pass and and there there's just there's more of them uh but let's just take a second if we could so we understand that here's the prophecy that was given about Satan's zeden and the God of this evil age so a prophet comes on the scene and he says do you see the scheme do you see it he says this is what he's doing he's building a system he's building a kingdom he's building an Eden thank you Lord God more scientific more beautiful than than Michael's Kingdom and he's telling us what he's doing what he's doing and then he starts throwing in these things that'll happen they won't know whether they're a man or woman they they they'll have plagues fall and they'll put on mask they'll do this and they'll do that and they'll walk around with a thing in their ear why you know could you imagine someone coming up from 50 years ago you walk into the store and people are walking around talking there's nobody there you want to go lay hands on everybody you think they all escape from the institution but they all got something in their ear a blue tooth well I know what color blue belongs to you better go research that yourself I I like blue but that I'm just saying so we see this side okay but it's it's so watered down because how does Satan appear as an angel of Light look what I've got for you today oh yeah pretty soon they'll say you want to know where your kid is let's put the chip in them they already know where you are by your cell phone that's how they determine traffic how many cell phones are all stacked up that's why if you look for something you know like I you know I thought I was going to order something for my wife on the internet you know what I mean got to try this shopping at home day well the ad shows up on her computer why am I getting ads for dish towels all of a sudden or something like that I don't know spiritual amnesia lulling us to sleep don't have to be on fire for God what are we anticipating don't buy 5G cuz 6G will be out next week I want it to sink in I'm watching this virus kill the church binding people in fear people go to work but they're afraid to come to church cuz this is where they're going to get it since when do Satan convinced everybody that the church was the place you were getting sick you get sick out in the world but if we're not a Spirit-filled church and we're not hungering for God and we're not praying for one another and we're lukewarm and we're backslid and we're taking everything that Satan has to give us and the church becomes powerless then you ought to be afraid of that church that's the church you ought to be afraid of but that's the church you ought to change that's what's happening I sat with the man the other day the man that rent us the facility for for the young peoples get together he said we have to sell this building they said well that's too bad this is beautiful he says yeah we can't keep it anymore and I felt for him because I know what he's going through our offerings are down 2third we take in a third of the money that we used to you know out of sight out of mind you know you never should come to church and all of a sudden decide you give because the offering baskets in front of you you want to be blessed don't Rob god with tithes and offerings set it aside if it's a dollar say Lord this is the dollar I'm giv amen you know but but what what I'm saying is is this is having an effect but let's just stop there and let's talk about the other prophecy because we don't want to be caught in between these two prophecies and so let's let's just take a a quick second and we'll talk about those things sorry if I got off on a few soap boxes but this is from the Masterpiece and so I'd like to uh read this to you now so we have this other side and so we we see what Satan's trying to achieve right so he's trying to achieve to get the world in the place where he can come up with his one world head you know somebody that can bring the world together and now the Lord has something that he's trying to do cuz Satan started his Eden in Eden didn't he he went and got Adam's bride to take him as her husband before Adam you see that right that's what he did he got to her first and offered his tree of knowledge and she took it cuz he was going to build a bigger better Kingdom than Michael had so he got to her first and and in doing so he he destroyed it and this what he said now notice this masterpiece when Satan got a hold of it the deceiver broke through the walls and he marred this masterpiece now this masterpiece was Adam and Eve in the garden that was God's Masterpiece family you understand that you Bible readers and he and he marred this masterpiece because that because that's paragraph 55 of the Masterpiece if you can put it up there because I know I'm not a very good page paragraph 55 page 11 of the Masterpiece because that the way he did it how did he do it I'll go more into detail of it how he done it this was the Masterpiece was walled by the word by the word God's word and the Masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by this word but but the broken part that was broken off of of the original went out beyond that wall it gives Satan a chance to Mar it and now as you know what I believe on those things so I won't have time to say that but the Masterpiece was broken he's referring to serpent se but the great sculpture when he seen the fall of his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image amen am amen so now we know what what God's achievement was amen Satan was building his own Eden where he would be the God God's on this side and he says I'm going to restore my family am if you go back and listen and just look it up the prophet of God's continually telling us back to Eden Back to Eden we're going back to Eden you understand he always was telling us you come from somewhere we're going back redeemed means to bring back again he keeps telling us you're a people that are not part of Satan's evened you're a people that aren't part of this evil age you're elected you're selected you're chosen don't get caught between the two prophecies there's another prophecy right again in the Masterpiece paragraph 156 do you have that why why must the bridegroom be the word manifest made plain it's because the bride and the bridegroom are one right she is just smitten piece off of him there's the Masterpiece it was smitten yes sir Michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but God is going to do it amen he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there's the Masterpiece the family back again in the Garden of Eden wonderful so there's another achievement yes sir right you don't want to get stuck in between the two achievements sir so there's something that God wants to achieve yes sir and he's inviting you to get in his program yes sir and to do what's necessary which by the way is selling out in order to be a part of what he's achieving now he's already prophesied and said I'm going to destroy this other Eden so enter into the ark get on board how is this bride going to do this how is the wheat going to do this Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back restored back like the beginning take it back I will restore saith the Lord all the years the palmerworm and the cankerworm and all these other things have eaten I will restore again Malachi 4 said he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to the original fathers again see we see this right before us Church where are we at amen right okay so now we we what he's what he's told us and through many other prophecies could been prophesied what this Satan's Eden would do and we're sitting back and we're seeing it and I see it I read it I see it and I still am amazed I Marvel how can man get any more crazy they kill babies now they're setting the stage for euphanasia right we we we can't even comprehend we can't comprehend the mass murder of millions of Jews I recommend you all to go to the Holocaust Museum in Dallas and watch how Hitler educated the people against the Jews he blam blame them for sickness did you know that cuz they didn't get sick because they washed they did they washed their food okay he blamed them for their economics because they didn't do business with uncer things they didn't buy meat from an uncer butcher they didn't buy things like pigs and and things like that they followed the law and the word of the law preserved them by itself they married in their own ranks so they knew their family history they they they weren't marrying boys that didn't have a good background nobody knew their parents all kinds of stuff come in they were accountable to one another and Hitler just began to go out and lay these things out there and lay these things out there and he began to teach them these are the cause of this these are the cause of our economical problem look at how they all Prosper you know why they seem to prosper they were content they were content with what they had they gave glory to God they separated themselves because they were a separated people they became easy to blame how separated are we and he convinced them you know Canada just shut down Thursday I talked to my friend Danny far uh brother brother Danson up there good brother brother uh Ezekiel and Andre's brother brother VI's son was wanting to get married sorry can't get married can't come together so I said well how are they doing that how do they enforce it he says what they've done is they've turned all the ambulance drivers all the fire people all the social workers they've deputized them all and they have a snitch line so if you have a meeting they call the snitch line and then one of these deputized people come out and they write you a citation there are people up there that have come from country R like that and they're saying this is what happened to us in Germany this is what happened to us in Cuba this is what happened to us in Venezuela this is what happened this is what's happening to us now it's happening can you believe that the mall's open but Church ain't the gas station is open but you can't get a spiritual fill up so so we we see it yes sir we see that great thing that's unfolding how how that he just brought that in there but now we we look and we see that that this great uh masterpiece he said now a sculpture wouldn't make a Great Masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings as our Lord told us a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel when we become God's Masterpiece we are not hid in the alley somewhere we must give [Music] light but God in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going back he's going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that never has come yet right that is in countdown paragraph 37 now so God's achievement and his people are looking forward Amen to things that's promised in the word that we haven't seen yet so we know and there's quote after quote that I could read you this morning but I'll hurry now is that there's promises or prophecies made of the restoration and of the Bride coming and doing the works that he said that we would do he told us of these things he says for they're looking for the spiritual Revelation to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised so that's that hunger I'm talking about if we see this side of the prophecy we see everything he said about the world coming to pass the science the education the knowledge people walking around with things sticking out of their ear not knowing where their men or woman seeing the vice president come in wearing masks wow now there's the other side of the prophecy of people that are hungering thirsting after righteousness uh a people that know that God's got something for they're looking for the things the promises that haven't been manifested yet they're looking for that life that's in Christ just the way it should be but now friends may I say this it has come to the age of the astronaut I think Billy might have read this for us we have moved out of the airplane age we've got more power now the astronaut age has come in what is it we've come into a spiritual age of astronauts see going above it's the same Spirit only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more see more how many have had your spiritual isab I counsel the to buy of me IAD that I mayest see there's coming a time where the church will see any more you see that yeah that's one side of the prophecy but do you see the other side have you prayed for the Revelation that opens your eyes to see what God Said don't get caught between the two prophecies yes sir see more believe more be more like Christ not the Ile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above to each one it's called The Eagle age in the Bible God calls His prophets Eagle AGS we realize over in the Bible we find it Malachi 4 that were promised that in the last days now he's like His prophets to be Eagles he calls them Eagles he's the great Jehovah Eagle he he is able to achieve to himself a bride amen he is going to in the last days be able to get a bride that with a ministry that's so exactly like a man and his wife becoming one he's going to get this Pride with the ministry now I want to say this I'm just going to look for the words brother Brandon was the first fruits that's right you understand all he didn't leave all these prophecies just concerning himself that's right in other words he brought these prophecies because they concerned you he was the elaser call he was the one that was sent to bring a bride he even makes that statement I I've been sent to bring a in Chase to him a Chase virgin to present to him a chased virgin that's right so he's looking for a he said that with the ministry that's so exactly like a man and his wife becoming one and when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one amen now this is the other side yes sir right of the prophecy amen the other side of the prophecy that there's things we haven't seen yet higher Heights that we can go to to be more like Christ course he don't want you to have that come on boy every time you head that way he says let me I got something new for you have you seen this wow all of a sudden you qualify for a loan you can't afford I'll lend you $300,000 really I'll give it to you for 2% oh how much is that a month $1,800 okay I I can work Saturdays doing this I can work Tuesday nights Thursday nights let me buy every ounce of you your time what can I trade you for your time what car can I give you what boat can I give you what house can I give you what can I give you for your time let me buy your time and we read that last week how they spend so much money on cosmetics 998 billion dollar to be something you're not I mean I I I don't even I don't even know how to preach against it it's so crazy and and so he's buying our time and then here's this other prophecy that's prophesied and he's saying what this bride does is she starts hungering and thirsting after righteousness amen that's right now to be more Christlike what time is it so if you're going to be what Christlike then you have to be what what he preached is that right now just go back with me a moment and so you sit back in a moment AR good just think all the people that are at home they can just go get the refrigerator and get something they can get up and go to the bathroom and they don't have to go through this and you have to suffer but can you imagine come on preacher he shows up on the scene and he begins to preach and and so and he he finally he gets to he gets to Matthew in the Book of Matthew and he gets on the sermon of the mount and he says you have heard that was said by them of old times and then he starts to preach and then over in the 27th verse he says you have heard heard that it was said by them of old times and then he comes down farther and he says again in the 33rd verse you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time can you imagine him beginning to preach that there was a new life there was a new expectation there was a new power there was a new fulfillment that was coming that it wasn't something that they ever had before that they were going to Exodus out of the law that they were under into a Spirit-filled experience and a union with God where they were GNA go wait in an upper room and be endued with power from on high and the works that I do shall you do also now let me tell you something that's what the prophet of God taught the church you couldn't be what he was a prophet you couldn't open the seals cuz the word of God comes to to a prophet but the prophecy pertaining to you he gave he tore both sides of the prophecy he prophesied what the bride would be he prophesied what power she would have he prophesied that she'd be lifted up in the higher grounds he prophesied if that she would knock and open I will come in and sck with them and I'll eat the evening meal so there's another side of the prophecy that's been prophesied about a people that sits down with him and eats the spiritual Revelation that is going to produce in her the faith to do the same works that he did and not just the Miracle Works the Miracle Works of blessed art The Peacemaker for they shall be called the children of God blessed are them that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled amen blessed are them who visit the father and the widows in their Affliction the whole other teaching that the Lord Jesus Christ taught of the life of God manifested in a people that have become so Christlike that they're a Shining Light that's prophesied that's the other prophecy somebody that is is uh is so spiritually in tune with god brother Bram says that she doesn't even wink at the other side you know he said a woman should never even wink at a man carry a conversation have any emotion at all with someone that's not your husband none God of this evil age I'll just give you the paragraph you go you go home and and and read it I don't know I had my book up here I just no this is a I I need to say this just so I can I can just have you go find it if you would because it's very important that's right he says how can the bride of Christ associate in a denomination when one is disobedient and the other obedient this is paragraph 1 1 36 God of this evil age when one is disobedient the other obedient how can one be the word and the other one pervert the word how can a how can a a a prostitute and a clean woman walk together in a griev agreement they can't do it and then uh see if I can find okay and then now this is paragraph 162 now look if a woman goes out here and is married to a man and she goes out and makes love with another man and has an affair with him and comes back to her husband he should kick her out is that right she must be true to him because she is vowed to him and the bride of Christ is vowed to Christ This is a prophecy this is the other side of the prophecy this is telling what this bride will be like how she'll be how she'll be identified for the Rapture she is vowed to Christ and he is the word not even wink at the other side a woman should not even wink at another man she should make no signs no emotions at all towards him for she is absolutely a bride to a bridegroom we don't want none of your mix tree your denominations be true to Christ the word he'll vindicate it to be true no sir not even an motion of anything towards making love to him not joining his ranks or anything else or let him get you in his arms or in his care you talk or talk to you over this way that way I'll tell you I've seen a lot of our young people get caught up in all this political stuff that's out there forming opinions about people poison let me warn you as somebody who loves you there's neither Bond nor free Jew nor Greek male nor female we are all Christ and Christ is God God is not a respector of persons and I don't care how ugly the world gets to you it don't matter eternal life what the prophecy of this bride is is what should be mattering to us how do we fulfill the prophecy that's spoken of what this bride will be what he said she would be every single one of us should be concentrating on our life look what he says he says emotion make love to him this way you only you listen only to one voice my sheep know my voice a stranger what is this voice any man's voice is his word and this is it the Bible not one word to be added to it or taken from it just stay right with that voice a stranger they won't follow amen there's a prophecy concerning us what we will be the messenger described to us what she would be she would be endued with power from on high the faith would re be restored back to her she would follow the teachings of the word of God she would be Christian her light would be shining she would be about the father's business she would be she would be uh doing the things that he said she'd be fighting the other Kingdom she'd be finding seeking for last Souls and she would be filling getting people filled with the Holy Ghost she would she would be fighting finding and filling she would be about the father's business she would be adopted she'd be fulfilling the prophecy she would be free from the world so he has his achievement now like the close with this and now when the Brethren received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they say this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong there is no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on right it's the unlimited resource of God has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never been even revealed to archangels is laying just ahead for the church that will believe for ith not seen or ear not heard neither has it entered into the hearts of men in what God has prepar has for them in store that love him so let's move up and claim our rights as God opens the gates and swings out the welcoming mat let's move on up into deeper depths let's don't get caught between the two prophecies let's start moving up let's start looking in our lives let's start applying the token let's start preparing never con colonialized ourselves oh I me we really have a bad problem with that to organize ourselves and get into a place where this where we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from god let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God my heart to us this morning is we see all this is happening to us what's going on but let's don't let us Rob us of the prophecy amen that's been prophesied of what this bride let's don't let this stop us from running to the promises and running to the Fulfillment and running to the Revelation that will transer us into people that are prepared for a Rapture don't let this plague don't let this world don't let this Eden starve us out lose our appetite lose our vision lose our call for Revelation and more of God that's what it don't let it catch us yes and keep us C thought between the two prophecies let's don't be lukewarm let's go after all that God has for us higher Heights things we haven't seen yet more power of God in you than you've ever had before don't wink at the world don't talk with the world don't get close to the world separate yourself from it there God's got he's got the windows of Heaven he wants to pour and he's Ed you and chosen you he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer it's still the blood that purchased us don't let them Rob us Saints I counsel thee to buy me a gold Trident fire right reom it I said that thou might see that the shame of our nakedness doesn't appear knock and I'll open and you can come in and S with me and eat the evening meal in other words eat the prophecy that I have prophesied concerning you is that your desire this morning I know I'm not what I ought to be and I know I'm not what I want to be but I know I'm not what I used to to be and I know that there's a there's something in here that calls there's a deep that calls to a deep and if there's a deep that calls to a deep then there's got to be a deep to respond if the prophet prophesied of a bride Victorious and he said he is going to have a bride he is going to separate a bride I want to be a part of that prophecy I don't want to get stuck between the two prophecies between the two kingdoms no man can serve two masters I want to sell out to the prophecy I want to sell out to the prophecy that the prophet spoke of this bride can you join us in that will you pray for me maybe you're there and I'm just a hungry Soul saying oh God I see what he says but when can I see it made manifested in me that's my desire God bless you if you stand brother Billy if you'd come maybe we just have a word of prayer before we go sorry if I was lengthy just ask your heart this morning God doesn't judge on the inside he judges the spirit of a man he judges the inner man God judges is what you're hungry for he judges what you long for that's why he said all ye that are hungry all ye that are burdened in heavy laden all you that are thirsty come unto me and I'll give you rest I just ask this morning have you lost your appetite for the things of God has Satan made it so difficult to be a Christian so controversy to let your light shine that it's just easier to slip it under a bushel basket but the prop said I'm a great architect doesn't take a masterpiece and sit it in a building even this building he doesn't set it in a building he doesn't put it in an alley he said we must let our light shine and if you'd ask yourself and I'd ask myself this morning what light are we shining what
