[27:23] before i pray i just wanted to give a
[27:26] little testimony i've
[27:28] been meaning to give it for a couple of
[27:30] weeks and
[27:31] was just kind of holding back
[27:33] [Music]
[27:35] it was something small to me but in the
[27:38] eyes of the lord you know
[27:39] nothing's too small
[27:43] me and my brother-in-law were
[27:46] moving a piece of glass it was pretty
[27:48] heavy and
[27:50] i pulled my back and
[27:51] [Music]
[27:53] i it didn't really bother me too bad at
[27:57] first but by the time the end of the day
[27:59] i got home and it was hurting pretty bad
[28:02] and i couldn't
[28:02] stand up straight all that well
[28:06] and uh i just prayed that night
[28:09] you know and and believed that i would
[28:12] be healed in the morning and
[28:13] i got up the next morning and i was just
[28:15] stiff it really
[28:17] it wasn't bad at all and as the week
[28:19] went on it just
[28:20] it just went away and i really i really
[28:23] i thought it was going to be
[28:24] pretty bad but i guess the lord
[28:27] just uh he looks out for us and i just i
[28:31] i claimed the healing and it was gone

[43:19] his presence come down on
[43:21] when you're all alone maybe at your

[43:43] truly as the author penned this song and

[43:47] nothing like your presence lord
[43:50] we know that in your presence lord
[43:54] there's fullness of joy there's fullness
[43:56] of life
[43:57] there's deliverance there's healings
[44:00] there's
[44:00] answered questions there's peace
[44:04] lord and we're thankful that we have a
[44:06] divine
[44:07] promise that says where two or three are
[44:09] gathered
[44:10] that you would be in our midst and lord
[44:13] even more than that
[44:14] you said that you'd be with us that
[44:15] you'd be even in us
[44:17] until the end of the world lord and
[44:21] you said greater is he that is in us
[44:22] than he that is in the world
[44:26] lord you told us that the kingdom of
[44:27] heaven doesn't come with observation
[44:30] but the kingdom of heaven is within us
[44:32] lord
[44:33] lord grant us a greater revelation of
[44:35] these things
[44:36] lord we thank you for your word we thank
[44:38] you for this gathering
[44:41] we thank you for your presence lord we
[44:43] thank you for the blood of jesus christ
[44:45] that cleanses us from all of our sins
[44:48] that we can come here and worship you in
[44:49] spirit and in truth lord
[44:51] we just commit ourselves to you now lord
[44:54] as humbly as we know how
[44:56] just asking that you'd come and break
[44:57] the bread of life lord as only you can
[44:59] now
[45:00] we pray we ask these things in your name
[45:01] the lord jesus christ
[45:03] amen and praise the lord if you have
[45:06] your bibles
[45:07] let's just turn in isaiah 29 and we'll
[45:12] read verse 11 here
[45:16] maybe just to help us to have a place to
[45:19] to start from isaiah 29 11.
[45:31] it says in the vision of all is become
[45:34] unto you as the words of a book that is
[45:37] sealed
[45:38] which men deliver to one that has
[45:40] learned saying read this i pray thee
[45:43] and he saith i cannot
[45:46] for it is sealed amen we just ask the
[45:48] lord to bless the reading of his word
[45:51] he may be seated
[45:56] and i just trust that the lord could
[45:59] will help this little thought that we
[46:00] have on our heart
[46:01] just be able to
[46:05] speak to you in a way that will
[46:07] illuminate the word and
[46:08] draw you closer to him and into higher
[46:10] heights
[46:11] you know as we think of the words right
[46:13] here that are written here in isaiah
[46:17] saying that and the vision of all has
[46:19] become unto you
[46:20] as the words of a book that is sealed
[46:23] which
[46:25] men deliver to one that has learned
[46:26] saying read this i pray thee and saith i
[46:29] cannot
[46:30] afford a sealed you know certainly in
[46:32] our hearts when we read this
[46:34] it makes us start to think of the seven
[46:37] seals and the book of redemption
[46:39] that was sealed and that no man could
[46:41] look there upon
[46:43] maybe we even start to think of john
[46:45] there in revelations 5
[46:46] looking and saying no no man is worthy
[46:50] to look there on or to read the things
[46:52] that are in the book
[46:54] but by god's grace we we we know the
[46:56] rest of the story
[46:58] the lion of the tribe of judah he
[47:00] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[47:02] the seven seals
[47:04] thereof so this book of redemption that
[47:06] was sealed that no one could look at
[47:08] uh it was sealed up until the end time
[47:11] but there was a divine promise
[47:13] that at the end time that the book would
[47:15] be loosed and the seven seals would be
[47:17] revealed and so
[47:19] now a book of redemption which is the
[47:21] bible that had been sealed down through
[47:23] the ages now comes a time
[47:25] where it is unsealed and the very
[47:28] mysteries and the very things that are
[47:29] in the book
[47:30] or the very vision because if you look
[47:32] at what it says it says the vision was
[47:34] put into a book
[47:35] and so we know before the foundation of
[47:37] the world and we start talking about the
[47:39] logos
[47:40] we get back into the very mind of god
[47:42] and the very thoughts of god
[47:44] and it wasn't until that god and those
[47:46] thoughts were spoken
[47:48] and he spoke the word and then that word
[47:50] that was spoken
[47:51] it's been written into the scriptures by
[47:54] the prophets who the word of the lord
[47:55] came to
[47:56] but before that word was even ever
[47:58] written into the book there was a vision
[48:00] or a thought or or something that god
[48:03] had had in his mind
[48:04] that he was going to reveal in the end
[48:07] time and we just kind of want to speak
[48:09] to you a little along the lines of the
[48:11] vision of the bride
[48:12] and if we just move into the book of
[48:14] habakkuk chapter 2 if you'll read with
[48:16] me
[48:16] as maybe they would put it on the screen
[48:18] it says and the lord
[48:20] answered habakkuk 2 2 answered me and
[48:22] said write the vision
[48:24] and make it plain upon tables that he
[48:27] may run that readeth it
[48:30] now just it just makes me even think to
[48:33] the scripture
[48:34] that we just read there's only one way
[48:37] that you could read it is if
[48:38] it's revealed to you it says the learned
[48:41] had looked at it they had no way to
[48:43] comprehend
[48:44] or understand it so there has to be
[48:46] something transpire
[48:47] to give the ability to the one that
[48:49] readeth it that he may run it says for
[48:51] the vision
[48:52] is yet for an appointed time but at the
[48:54] end it shall speak
[48:56] and it not lie though at terry wait for
[48:58] it because it will surely come
[49:01] it will not tarry and i just want to
[49:02] pull from a quote here
[49:04] out of god does doesn't call a man to
[49:06] judgment without first warning him just
[49:08] to
[49:08] tie this scripture in with what the
[49:10] prophet said he says now
[49:11] when he speaks of a vision now just
[49:14] remember we're
[49:15] we're speaking about uh the bride's
[49:18] vision so we want to maybe understand
[49:20] what a vision is or how it works
[49:22] or what it means to us it says when he
[49:24] speaks of his vision
[49:25] whether it's wrath or whether it's
[49:27] healing it may linger
[49:29] but it's got to come to pass if he
[49:31] speaks it in the name of the lord see
[49:34] it might be a blessing that he speaks
[49:36] for you he might be
[49:38] he might tell you certain thing and you
[49:40] can't see it all
[49:41] you you say how can it be well
[49:44] he told me thus saith the lord this is
[49:46] going to happen
[49:47] and that was going to happen and it
[49:50] ain't happened
[49:51] that man's wrong now you'll be judged
[49:54] for disbelieving it
[49:56] but it's going to happen anyhow see it's
[49:59] got to happen
[50:01] though it linger though it linger my
[50:04] i wonder if there's something that
[50:06] you're believing for i wonder if there's
[50:08] things that you've looked into the word
[50:10] and
[50:10] something in your heart has cried out
[50:13] for an attribute of god to be manifested
[50:15] in you
[50:16] and you've prayed for and you've asked
[50:18] for it and you've called before the
[50:20] doors of heaven if you will
[50:22] and you've asked over and over and over
[50:25] now i believe god in his word there's
[50:27] something
[50:27] in your heart of faith that has latched
[50:29] onto a promise
[50:30] because that's what really even causes
[50:32] us to ask god for it
[50:34] because there's something in the in the
[50:36] word or something in a believer that
[50:38] knows
[50:38] that we can go to our heavenly father
[50:41] and ask him for something if we ask him
[50:42] for bread he's not going to give us a
[50:44] stone
[50:45] if we ask him for things that we can
[50:47] find in the word
[50:48] we believe in our heart knowing that he
[50:50] said if you ask of me if you ask
[50:52] anything in my name
[50:53] you shall have it now if it's lingering
[50:57] is it is it in the lingering that we
[50:58] start to doubt is it in the lingering
[51:00] that we get confused
[51:01] is it in the lingering of the
[51:03] manifestation of the promise
[51:05] where we start to get discouraged and we
[51:07] start to let down and we start to allow
[51:09] doubt to come into our mind
[51:10] where we start to disbelieve or start to
[51:13] allow
[51:13] doubt to to to start to interfere with
[51:16] our
[51:17] our heart and our mind and we get begin
[51:19] to start questioning
[51:20] did he really mean what he said well i
[51:22] want to tell you yes
[51:23] he meant what he said so that very
[51:26] promise that you're believing in that
[51:27] very sound that you're hanging on for
[51:29] that very healing and that very
[51:31] manifestation in your body
[51:33] although it may linger i want to tell
[51:35] you he said by his stripes
[51:37] you are healed though it linger i want
[51:39] to encourage you
[51:40] don't get discouraged don't doubt you
[51:42] stand on the word of promise you keep
[51:44] believing it
[51:45] you keep spinning it because though it
[51:47] lingered the bible said
[51:48] yet will it speak in its season my it
[51:51] will come to pass and just when it comes
[51:53] to past
[51:54] the joy bells will start to roll oh let
[51:56] that
[51:57] word become a positive confession go on
[51:59] and speak it and
[52:00] put it in your mouth why don't you go
[52:02] ahead and just start to testify
[52:04] why didn't you go to receive it like
[52:06] faith receives something
[52:07] it receives those things that are not
[52:09] and cause them as though they are
[52:11] oh you might feel weak and feeble you
[52:14] might feel
[52:15] cashed down and down trodden but let me
[52:18] be a john ryan
[52:20] let me look into the wire there was a
[52:22] vision that was given unto john ryan
[52:24] and said you were healed well what
[52:27] happened a little doubt started to creep
[52:29] in and he came back
[52:31] he told the prophet i thought you said i
[52:34] was healed
[52:36] and what does the prophet say back to
[52:37] him he said i thought you believed
[52:41] okay i'm learning now i'm learning so
[52:44] and linger
[52:45] i believe but throw it linger now i'm
[52:47] gonna start to put my
[52:49] the my faith where my mouth is i'm about
[52:52] to go start speaking the word of god and
[52:54] say
[52:54] extra extra all about it by his stripes
[52:57] i'm healed what are you talking about
[53:00] brother
[53:00] what are you talking about sister you
[53:02] look just as sick as you ever
[53:03] a matter of fact it looks like you're
[53:05] even getting sicker
[53:07] i don't care what the doctor says i
[53:09] don't care what you're looking at
[53:10] i'm looking at a divine promise of
[53:12] almighty god that said
[53:14] i am healed and though the manifestation
[53:17] of it
[53:17] might linger oh in its season it's going
[53:20] to come to pass and it'll speak for
[53:22] itself
[53:27] though it would linger
[53:30] yet will it speak in its season it'll
[53:32] come to pass
[53:35] the prophet's only looking off and
[53:37] seeing something
[53:39] he's talking about what he's looking at
[53:43] he ain't thinking about here and what
[53:45] you look like now
[53:48] he's looking what you're going to be
[53:53] and when he speaks that
[53:56] if it's in the word of the lord it's
[53:59] already bespoke
[54:00] and there's nothing in the world that
[54:03] can stop it
[54:06] oh my i just want to start looking into
[54:08] the scripture right now and looking at
[54:10] all the promises that are laying in the
[54:12] word
[54:13] and when this seventh sealed mystery
[54:15] book of redemption was loosed
[54:17] and the seven seals were revealed and my
[54:19] name was called
[54:20] because my name was on that title d my
[54:23] name was in there i heard my name
[54:25] i want to be present for the reading of
[54:27] the will i want to know all that has
[54:30] been given to me
[54:30] i want to know all that is mine
[54:35] and it's in the the hearing of that word
[54:38] it's in
[54:40] the vision being made known unto us and
[54:42] when we start to hear these things
[54:44] we start to believe it we start to
[54:46] receive it we start to act on it
[54:48] and if we can look in there and call
[54:50] those things as other not say you know
[54:51] what though
[54:52] it might not look like it now but just
[54:54] like the prophet said
[54:55] he ain't thinking about hearing what you
[54:58] look like now
[55:00] you're not worried about your condition
[55:01] now he's looking at something that
[55:04] you're going to be
[55:06] and so i know there's been a word that
[55:08] has been spoken of us
[55:10] there has been a prophetic word in a
[55:12] vision concerning the bride and the
[55:14] image of christ that you are coming into
[55:16] and you might not see all of the
[55:18] attributes of god
[55:20] and the very things that he's spoken of
[55:21] you in yourself now
[55:23] but if the word has been spoken if the
[55:26] word or that vision
[55:27] has already been seen that was in his
[55:28] mind before the foundation of the world
[55:31] then it's going to come to pass and
[55:33] nothing can stop it
[55:36] i just was rejoicing in the words that
[55:38] we heard this
[55:40] sunday and our pastor speaking about the
[55:42] carriers of the promise
[55:45] praise praise god that we can look into
[55:48] the word and we're called to believe it
[55:51] it's not up to us in our own ability as
[55:54] a man or as a human to bring the
[55:55] promised word to past
[55:57] but we are called to believe it we're
[55:59] called to believe
[56:00] every single word what you know well
[56:02] people want to know if they
[56:04] they have the holy ghost and and the
[56:06] devil's able to get people uh
[56:07] uh cornered into a place where where
[56:10] they just
[56:10] don't even know who they are and we
[56:12] think of the word test look
[56:14] uh do you believe what he said
[56:17] why don't you give yourself the word
[56:19] test do you believe what the word
[56:20] says look you're called to believe the
[56:23] word and that's what abraham did and it
[56:25] was accounted unto him for righteousness
[56:28] he believed god's word and he he
[56:30] considered him faithful to fulfill the
[56:32] promise that he had gave him
[56:33] and he just went forth believing with no
[56:35] ability to fulfill the promise in
[56:37] himself
[56:38] you could imagine maybe the conversation
[56:40] he'd be having with sarah
[56:41] and them feeling so insignificant and
[56:44] maybe in their minds filling the brink
[56:46] of insanity
[56:48] and a man with a testimony getting older
[56:50] in age saying i'm going to be the father
[56:51] of nations
[56:52] imagine the rebuke imagine the reproach
[56:54] amongst his neighbors
[56:56] and his friends and his family when he
[56:58] would tell them oh i'm going to be the
[56:59] father
[56:59] of many nations god has come down and
[57:02] he's spoken directly to me i i've
[57:05] i've had a visitation
[57:08] i've had a vision from the lord all you
[57:09] can imagine
[57:12] maybe in their mind and their ability
[57:13] and i wonder i believe many times we
[57:15] feel like that too
[57:17] that we're called to go into a rapture
[57:18] we're called to go into a body change
[57:21] what that's going to look like and how
[57:23] it's going to happen at what time and
[57:24] what day
[57:25] i don't know i don't know if it's gonna
[57:27] be at nine o'clock
[57:28] six o'clock twelve o'clock is it going
[57:30] to be at one time frame around the whole
[57:32] globe
[57:33] is it going to be a sweep well i believe
[57:34] the rapture cycle has already started
[57:37] i've heard a word that started to lift
[57:39] me off from the face of the earth
[57:40] i have heard the shout oh behold the
[57:43] lord cometh with a shout
[57:45] oh we've heard the midnight cries says
[57:47] go ye out to meet him
[57:48] so all i know is i've accepted and
[57:50] received my eleazar that is leading me
[57:53] to the promised land and all i know is i
[57:55] just want to be faithful
[57:56] and believe the word that i've received
[57:59] how it's going to happen i don't know
[58:03] i'm not called to make it happen i'm
[58:06] called to believe it until it happens
[58:11] so just being encouraged on that and
[58:14] and now brother billy came behind that
[58:16] and started to talk about the pattern of
[58:18] god
[58:19] oh and how there was a pattern there in
[58:21] heaven that god had something in his
[58:23] mind and then
[58:24] moses oh he came down with that pattern
[58:26] he laid it out in the tabernacle
[58:30] it was a pattern something that he had
[58:31] received from heaven and we know
[58:33] we can say the same thing that i came
[58:35] from god and i'm going back to god
[58:38] what we're doing now is the spiritual
[58:40] amnesia is being stripped away
[58:42] we had the shock of sin and we bypassed
[58:44] our theophany
[58:45] and we've ended up on down here we
[58:47] didn't even really know
[58:48] are the fullness that we had with the
[58:50] father in the beginning oh job
[58:52] where were you when i laid the
[58:54] foundation of the world where were you
[58:55] when the sons of god
[58:57] shouted for joy you were there i was
[58:59] fellowship with brother billy about that
[59:01] you know
[59:01] we had a choice brother billy said this
[59:03] he goes could you imagine
[59:05] if we hope i ain't stealing any of the
[59:06] thunder brother billy but he said could
[59:07] you imagine
[59:08] if we were standing over there and here
[59:11] the lord came and said you know what
[59:12] i want to ask you who will stand with me
[59:16] who will stand against this lucifer the
[59:18] one that is sowing these seeds of
[59:20] confusion
[59:21] who will stand with me and oh there was
[59:24] the sons of god that will stand with you
[59:26] we'll stand with you and say do you know
[59:27] what you're signing up for
[59:29] i don't care what i'm signing up for but
[59:31] if it's standing next to you i stand
[59:33] with you
[59:33] well if it means pain if it means things
[59:35] that i've never even experienced
[59:37] let me be found faithful standing next
[59:39] to your side and he says well
[59:41] do you realize there's going to be
[59:42] something called a shock of sin
[59:45] something is going to happen to you
[59:47] and there's going to be a shock of sin
[59:49] and you're actually going to bypass your
[59:51] theophany
[59:52] and the very state that you're in now
[59:54] and you're going to come down into an
[59:55] earthly form
[59:56] into an earthly a place in a realm of
[59:59] time
[1:00:00] and it's in that time you're going to
[1:00:01] experience sickness you're going to
[1:00:03] experience death you're going to
[1:00:05] experience all these things and the
[1:00:06] greatest or worst thing that you're
[1:00:08] going to experience
[1:00:09] you're not even going to know who you
[1:00:12] are
[1:00:15] your very identity that you have with me
[1:00:17] in the beginning
[1:00:18] oh you're not even going to know who you
[1:00:20] are well lord
[1:00:23] is that what you want for me because
[1:00:24] i'll stand with you yes
[1:00:27] yes that's my plan that's what i had in
[1:00:28] my mind from the very beginning lord
[1:00:30] i'll go whatever you want me to do lord
[1:00:33] i'll go
[1:00:35] and oh what has happened there's sons of
[1:00:37] god that was with him in the very
[1:00:39] beginning
[1:00:39] and now you found yourself in the
[1:00:42] deepest darkest
[1:00:43] uh worst age of all ages in a mock of
[1:00:46] unbelief all surrounded by a bunch of
[1:00:48] prostitutes
[1:00:49] and darkness that's so evil and men
[1:00:52] lovers of men and lovers of pleasure
[1:00:54] more than lovers of god oh it's such a
[1:00:56] sickness all over the face of the earth
[1:01:00] but there's a part of you
[1:01:03] that didn't come from here there's a
[1:01:06] part of you that can't identify
[1:01:09] and what it was it was his very heart
[1:01:11] purpose
[1:01:12] it was his very plan that as lucifer
[1:01:15] would come into a perfect eden
[1:01:17] there in the garden of eden and in a
[1:01:19] perfect eden
[1:01:21] that lucifer would deceive his children
[1:01:23] and they would fall
[1:01:24] he would allow a bride in the end time
[1:01:27] in satan's
[1:01:27] eden
[1:01:31] with all the obstacles and he said
[1:01:34] she'll do what eve couldn't do
[1:01:39] and that's believe the word and hold on
[1:01:41] to every single word
[1:01:43] can you imagine you have the opportunity
[1:01:45] and the privilege to live in the age
[1:01:47] that all the saints of
[1:01:48] old wanted to live in and now you are
[1:01:51] here
[1:01:52] and what is the word doing the vision
[1:01:54] the sealed book has been
[1:01:55] opened and now you're starting to
[1:01:57] realize who you are
[1:01:59] what was my plan in the plan of
[1:02:01] redemption where was i before i bypassed
[1:02:04] my theophany and you're starting to
[1:02:06] receive your identification as the
[1:02:07] revelation of the seals as unfolded to
[1:02:09] you which is christ
[1:02:12] oh and it's bringing you up into higher
[1:02:13] heights it's bringing you up into a
[1:02:16] realm where all things are possible
[1:02:24] oh what a wonderful word we've been
[1:02:26] feasting on
[1:02:28] this day this scripture is fulfilled oh
[1:02:31] we're walking right into that pattern
[1:02:33] paul said according as he has chosen you
[1:02:36] in him before the foundation of the
[1:02:38] world
[1:02:39] uh such wonderful things that were as
[1:02:41] this message unfolds we start to get a
[1:02:44] greater revelation
[1:02:45] of what these things mean in romans 8 14
[1:02:48] says for as many
[1:02:49] as are led by the spirit of god they are
[1:02:51] the sons of god
[1:02:54] jesus would say in john 5 19 he said the
[1:02:57] son can do nothing but what the father
[1:02:58] shows him
[1:03:00] and then the prophet of god would pick
[1:03:01] that up and you say now notice
[1:03:03] that when jesus said that the son can do
[1:03:06] nothing but what the father
[1:03:08] shows him to do notice that he didn't
[1:03:10] say here
[1:03:13] he said but shows him what to do he said
[1:03:15] what was it
[1:03:16] he was before i do anything i see by
[1:03:19] vision
[1:03:20] what the father shows me to do and then
[1:03:24] i go do it see now the word says in
[1:03:26] proverbs 29 18 it says
[1:03:28] where there is no vision that people
[1:03:31] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[1:03:33] is he
[1:03:34] and i want to focus on this portion
[1:03:35] right here in proverbs it says where
[1:03:37] there is no vision
[1:03:38] the people perish now the prophet of god
[1:03:41] would take this scripture and the voice
[1:03:42] of god in the last days and he would say
[1:03:44] it's a very outstanding time we realize
[1:03:48] that we're speaking from in the
[1:03:49] scriptures and really where he's pulling
[1:03:51] this text from he's going to refer
[1:03:54] um to samuel it says the word was
[1:03:57] precious in them days
[1:03:59] there was no open vision so the word of
[1:04:02] god was precious in them days there was
[1:04:04] no
[1:04:04] open vision and so now he's reading uh
[1:04:07] from this place in the scripture he says
[1:04:08] it's a very outstanding time we realize
[1:04:11] that what we're speaking from in the
[1:04:12] scriptures that has said there was no
[1:04:14] open vision in the days of samuel
[1:04:17] therefore where there's no vision the
[1:04:19] bible said the people perish
[1:04:22] we must have a vision and a vision
[1:04:26] comes to the prophets and it's the word
[1:04:30] of the lord
[1:04:30] spoken to them now this brother branham
[1:04:34] just said we must
[1:04:35] have a vision now maybe that might seem
[1:04:39] a little uh
[1:04:40] intimidating well i'm not a prophet
[1:04:45] brother matthew i can i can hardly have
[1:04:47] a spiritual dream a matter of fact i
[1:04:48] have more nightmares
[1:04:50] than i do spiritual dreams and now the
[1:04:52] prophet over here is saying we must
[1:04:55] have a vision and yes i hear jesus
[1:04:57] saying i do nothing but what the father
[1:04:59] shows me and hear the prophets tying
[1:05:01] that in
[1:05:01] and he's saying oh that he would have a
[1:05:03] vision well how am i
[1:05:05] ever going to go into that the scripture
[1:05:06] says let this mind be in you that was
[1:05:08] also in christ jesus
[1:05:09] let us go on unto perfection all of
[1:05:12] these things that have been spoken in
[1:05:13] the word and there's that part of us
[1:05:15] that came from god there in the
[1:05:17] beginning that believes that word but
[1:05:18] then we sit back with our carnal mind
[1:05:20] and we wonder what
[1:05:23] okay i got to have visions now so
[1:05:26] what it was going to take to have a
[1:05:27] vision now do i got to fashion to pray
[1:05:29] well maybe if i fast for eight days yog
[1:05:31] start having a vision
[1:05:34] do i gotta fast 12 days 20 days
[1:05:37] you go long enough without food i
[1:05:39] promise you i have a vision
[1:05:41] but you want a vision from the lord so
[1:05:44] if the prophet is saying here we must
[1:05:46] have a vision we must have a vision and
[1:05:50] if we must
[1:05:50] have a vision i want a vision so
[1:05:53] something in my heart is saying lord
[1:05:55] give me a vision i want a vision if i
[1:05:59] must have a vision lord
[1:06:00] then give me a vision how how can we
[1:06:03] have a vision he says a vision
[1:06:05] comes to the prophets
[1:06:08] and what is the vision now if we must
[1:06:11] have a vision he says the vision comes
[1:06:13] to the prophet
[1:06:14] and it's the word of the lord spoken to
[1:06:17] them
[1:06:18] now that's where just my heart purpose
[1:06:20] and what i'm speaking on to you tonight
[1:06:22] is the bride's vision it says
[1:06:24] where there's no vision the people
[1:06:27] perish
[1:06:30] what struck my heart is that where
[1:06:32] there's no vision
[1:06:33] the people perish what started to strike
[1:06:36] my heart with that scripture is praise
[1:06:38] god he has a vision concerning you
[1:06:41] praise god there is a vision concerning
[1:06:44] the bride of jesus christ because where
[1:06:46] there's no vision there's no word and
[1:06:48] where there's no word the people perish
[1:06:50] but all thank god in the end time god
[1:06:53] has sent a prophet
[1:06:55] with a vision and a word pertaining to a
[1:06:57] bride
[1:06:58] and he has called your name and he has
[1:07:00] revealed to you the vision
[1:07:02] the sealed book that was sealed has been
[1:07:05] open and now what is it doing it's
[1:07:07] revealing itself to you
[1:07:11] and that vision is concerning you
[1:07:14] it's a word from god that has come to
[1:07:18] the prophet that's how visions come
[1:07:21] that's how the word of the lord comes if
[1:07:23] god's going to do
[1:07:24] anything he reveals it unto his prophets
[1:07:28] the word of the lord comes to his
[1:07:30] prophet and now the prophet
[1:07:32] takes the word or the vision that he has
[1:07:35] received
[1:07:36] and he gives it out to the people and
[1:07:39] many times people don't understand
[1:07:41] when this man that has veiled like
[1:07:43] badger skin is standing there
[1:07:45] and he's speaking forth the word of god
[1:07:48] and they're rejecting that word
[1:07:50] they're not rejecting a man they're
[1:07:52] rejecting god
[1:07:54] to reject the prophet's message is to
[1:07:56] reject the vision of the word
[1:07:58] and when you've come into that place
[1:08:00] there's nothing left for it left for you
[1:08:02] but judgment
[1:08:04] this is a message of grace this is a
[1:08:07] message of love
[1:08:08] this is a message of unity this message
[1:08:12] is the greatest thing oh brother matthew
[1:08:14] you say message message message message
[1:08:15] message way too much well
[1:08:18] that might be the phonetic way that we
[1:08:20] describe what we've received at this
[1:08:22] hour
[1:08:23] call it the gospel the good news call it
[1:08:25] the words of jesus christ
[1:08:28] call it whatever you want to call it but
[1:08:29] i know i have met my redeemer
[1:08:32] i know that i have heard him speak my
[1:08:34] name in this day
[1:08:35] and it has changed me it's changed the
[1:08:37] way i acted it's changed the way i
[1:08:39] talk oh it's given me joy peace love and
[1:08:42] hope
[1:08:43] everything that the world could never
[1:08:45] give me and so much more
[1:08:48] oh that's what the gospel of jesus
[1:08:50] christ has done for me but not a gospel
[1:08:52] of 2000 years ago
[1:08:54] not a gospel of a glare in another age
[1:08:58] because we know that that gospel of
[1:09:00] another age can't do for you what we
[1:09:02] have need of in this hour
[1:09:05] it got to be jesus christ the same
[1:09:07] yesterday today and forever
[1:09:08] according to the prophet's vision
[1:09:12] when the word said we could go through
[1:09:15] all of the familiar scriptures that were
[1:09:17] familiar with but there had to come a
[1:09:18] day
[1:09:19] where he could stand there and say this
[1:09:21] day this scripture
[1:09:23] is fulfilled
[1:09:27] we must have a vision
[1:09:33] and just thinking along these lines of a
[1:09:35] vision i love the story
[1:09:39] you'll find it in first kings it starts
[1:09:41] to speak about how
[1:09:42] elijah there was at the brook cherith
[1:09:46] there was a famine in the land and god
[1:09:49] was feeding his prophet there
[1:09:50] with the ravens and he was there uh uh
[1:09:53] brother branham takes this text to
[1:09:55] preach spiritual food and due season
[1:09:57] and there he was shut away in a secret
[1:09:59] place where god was
[1:10:00] was was feeding him but then the lord
[1:10:03] moved upon him and said now i want you
[1:10:05] to
[1:10:05] to go down to their path because i've
[1:10:08] commanded a widow woman to sustain thee
[1:10:12] so elijah he gets up and he goes down to
[1:10:14] their path and there he finds this widow
[1:10:17] woman
[1:10:17] now god think of this now god had given
[1:10:20] the prophet a word of the lord or a
[1:10:21] vision
[1:10:22] and now he's leading his prophet down to
[1:10:25] a widow woman
[1:10:26] and brother branham said he she wasn't
[1:10:28] like everybody else that had taken the
[1:10:30] mark of the beast
[1:10:31] but she had kept herself separate from
[1:10:33] all of those unbelievers
[1:10:34] and there she was in that condition a
[1:10:37] believer
[1:10:39] a widow woman with her only child and
[1:10:41] there she is she's coming out
[1:10:43] what is she doing she's going to get a
[1:10:44] couple of sticks that she can go in and
[1:10:47] make a fire
[1:10:48] and she's going to eat that cake and
[1:10:49] she's going to die
[1:10:51] i believe her
[1:10:55] think of her condition now and now here
[1:10:56] comes a prophet
[1:10:58] coming on down to her and he comes there
[1:11:00] maybe to the gate
[1:11:03] and the conversation goes says hey fetch
[1:11:05] me
[1:11:06] a little drink of water now that's maybe
[1:11:09] something that she had a little bit
[1:11:11] extra of being a good believer that was
[1:11:14] something
[1:11:14] that she was willing to share and and
[1:11:16] maybe she only had enough water
[1:11:18] to go one or two more days but she
[1:11:20] figured you know i'm going to die
[1:11:21] anyways
[1:11:23] but maybe i'll just do something
[1:11:24] something in my heart says i'll do
[1:11:26] something for this
[1:11:27] weary traveler and he goes
[1:11:30] and he says as she starts to go he see
[1:11:33] he asked something of her
[1:11:35] and she was willing to do it many times
[1:11:38] what god is testing you is when he's
[1:11:40] asking you to do something when it's
[1:11:41] hard to do it
[1:11:44] and i believe that's what the word of
[1:11:45] the lord is going forth in this hour
[1:11:47] he's starting to challenge you on your
[1:11:49] education he's starting to challenge on
[1:11:51] your place of employment he's starting
[1:11:52] to challenge you on your hours and stuff
[1:11:54] that you do with entertainment on your
[1:11:56] phone
[1:11:56] he's starting to challenge you in areas
[1:11:58] of your life where it takes sacrifice
[1:12:00] and it's uncomfortable oh but we live in
[1:12:04] ladies we don't want to be uncomfortable
[1:12:09] you wanna you want a glass of water i'd
[1:12:11] get you a glass of water
[1:12:13] you want this or that i'll get you
[1:12:15] something but when it starts to affect
[1:12:17] your comfort
[1:12:18] when it starts to affect where you live
[1:12:20] it starts to affect what you drive
[1:12:22] if it starts to affect your education if
[1:12:24] it starts to affect your phd and your
[1:12:26] lld and all those other things that
[1:12:28] you're looking after
[1:12:29] if it starts to affect that lord i'm not
[1:12:32] willing to lay those things down
[1:12:33] i gotta have an education to make it
[1:12:35] ladies
[1:12:36] i got to have these nice things to make
[1:12:38] it ladies and what you do
[1:12:40] what do you start to do you start to
[1:12:42] substitute the word of god
[1:12:44] for the things of the world thinking
[1:12:46] that those are the things that are
[1:12:47] supplying your need and the very thing
[1:12:49] that you have need of is the word
[1:12:52] and you're sacrificing the word for your
[1:12:54] own enjoyment
[1:12:56] for your own pleasure and here the
[1:12:58] prophet is standing there says oh give
[1:13:00] me a drink of water
[1:13:01] come to church on sunday morning i can
[1:13:03] do that oh come to church on sunday
[1:13:05] night
[1:13:05] maybe i can do that ty's ten percent oh
[1:13:08] my goodness it's getting a little bit
[1:13:10] hard but maybe i could do it
[1:13:11] why don't you go ahead and come to
[1:13:12] church on a wednesday i just don't think
[1:13:14] i can do it
[1:13:15] i'll lose my job i've spent all this
[1:13:18] time to get this profession
[1:13:19] and i don't want to lose this profession
[1:13:21] but the spirit of the lord is calling
[1:13:23] out for the manifestations
[1:13:25] of the sons of daughters and through
[1:13:26] this hour to come to perfection
[1:13:29] where every word is thus saith the lord
[1:13:31] and they won't let one of them drop
[1:13:33] oh is there a house of god that would
[1:13:35] say be it unto me according to thy word
[1:13:38] let me manifest this word lord jesus
[1:13:42] and now the prophet of god is requiring
[1:13:44] something now noticeable
[1:13:46] this is part of the vision
[1:13:50] and so now he says to her now i want you
[1:13:53] to not only get me a drink of water but
[1:13:55] go ahead and bring me a cake
[1:13:58] all of a sudden now the conversation
[1:14:00] changes
[1:14:02] now you know you're requesting something
[1:14:05] of me
[1:14:05] that is a sacrifice between life and
[1:14:08] death
[1:14:10] oh that's where every believer has to
[1:14:12] come down to
[1:14:13] where you're willing to lay yourself
[1:14:15] down at the altar
[1:14:16] and you're willing to die and say lord
[1:14:19] jesus no matter whatever it takes
[1:14:21] if it's this friend if it's this family
[1:14:23] if it's this job
[1:14:24] no matter whatever it is lord i'm
[1:14:26] willing to die for the sake of your word
[1:14:29] and now it's getting down home where she
[1:14:31] has to make a decision and she's
[1:14:33] standing there
[1:14:34] oh a drink of water's good
[1:14:37] but now i want you to bring me a cake
[1:14:39] all right
[1:14:41] all right prophet
[1:14:44] now i don't think you maybe know what
[1:14:47] you're requiring of me
[1:14:50] but what i love about this she doesn't
[1:14:52] know
[1:14:53] that there was a vision pertaining to
[1:14:55] her she doesn't know that in her
[1:14:57] condition
[1:14:58] in that very hour of calamity where she
[1:15:01] is going to eat a cake
[1:15:02] and die there has been a word or a
[1:15:05] vision from the lord
[1:15:07] come to a prophet who has now come on
[1:15:09] the scene
[1:15:10] and he's going to speak the very word
[1:15:12] that's going to sustain her in the time
[1:15:14] of the drought
[1:15:15] woo hallelujah thank god there's been a
[1:15:18] prophet
[1:15:18] that has come on the scene with thus
[1:15:20] saith the lord to sustain the bride
[1:15:22] in a drought in an age where there's
[1:15:25] spiritual wickedness on every hand
[1:15:26] but he has spoken a word to sustain a
[1:15:29] bride and a feeder in this hour
[1:15:31] and now here she is she's standing there
[1:15:35] says all right bring me a cake first
[1:15:38] she's all right well hold on here
[1:15:42] maybe you don't understand the gravity
[1:15:44] of the situation
[1:15:47] you don't understand how many college
[1:15:49] hours i don't know why we keep going
[1:15:50] there
[1:15:52] sometimes we need to speak it though
[1:15:54] sometimes there might be a young
[1:15:56] a man of god who's called to the mission
[1:15:58] field or he's called to preach
[1:15:59] and he's weighing in the balance all of
[1:16:01] the money and the spending and his
[1:16:03] earnings and his
[1:16:04] visa and everything that has been laid
[1:16:06] out before him and he's walked in the
[1:16:07] footsteps of god and maybe it's
[1:16:08] all been not in vain but to bring him to
[1:16:10] this place now
[1:16:13] where he would stand like this widow
[1:16:14] woman and he would look
[1:16:17] standing there looking at the prophet
[1:16:19] you'd say bring me a cake first
[1:16:22] well i was gonna go in there
[1:16:26] and i was i was just gonna bake a cake
[1:16:30] and me and my son were going to die
[1:16:33] said okay i know the gravity of your
[1:16:36] situation
[1:16:38] but i want you to do as thou has said
[1:16:42] go ahead and go in there and bake a cake
[1:16:46] but bring me one first
[1:16:49] now all of a sudden i want to say now it
[1:16:51] was her part
[1:16:53] in the vision because now it was her
[1:16:56] opportunity to put god first
[1:17:00] and what does she do she goes in there
[1:17:02] and she does
[1:17:04] now what the vision had said she would
[1:17:06] do
[1:17:07] she goes in there and as she's going the
[1:17:09] prophet says thus saith the lord
[1:17:12] oh that barrel of meal will never run
[1:17:15] dry
[1:17:15] that cruce of oil will never run dry
[1:17:18] until i sin rain
[1:17:19] upon the earth why because she had put
[1:17:22] the lord first
[1:17:23] and that's what god is calling for us to
[1:17:25] do is to put him first the scripture
[1:17:27] says
[1:17:28] seek ye first the kingdom of god in his
[1:17:30] righteousness and
[1:17:31] all of these other things will be added
[1:17:33] unto you that's the vision of the lord
[1:17:35] that he's speaking to you in this hour
[1:17:37] is that you put him first and everything
[1:17:39] else he'll take care of
[1:17:40] it makes me think of of the prophet
[1:17:43] elisha
[1:17:44] there he was traveling and and there was
[1:17:48] this
[1:17:48] uh uh believer that saul and traveling
[1:17:51] by and she constrained him one day and
[1:17:52] said
[1:17:53] why don't you just stay here i i i maybe
[1:17:56] we'll make
[1:17:56] why don't you stay at our place and rest
[1:17:58] here a little while and as
[1:18:00] elisha would travel on by there uh they
[1:18:03] they
[1:18:03] that she spoke to her husband they built
[1:18:05] them a little partition
[1:18:06] built them a little uh a lean two off
[1:18:08] the side of the house and said look
[1:18:09] we've made your little apartment here
[1:18:11] you just come and go as you feel need uh
[1:18:14] if you're traveling or whatnot this is
[1:18:15] always a place for you
[1:18:17] and one day the prophet of god he gets
[1:18:19] up and he says
[1:18:21] you know gaza what can we do to repay
[1:18:26] this this woman and this man for all the
[1:18:29] kindness and the hospitality that they
[1:18:31] have shown unto us
[1:18:32] and gaheza says well prophet elijah
[1:18:36] he says uh though the woman is barren
[1:18:38] and the man is
[1:18:39] old in age and they have no son and so
[1:18:42] then the prophet of god
[1:18:44] comes to cure and says look because of
[1:18:47] what you have done unto me
[1:18:48] according to the time of life does that
[1:18:51] sound familiar
[1:18:52] reminds me of melchizedek coming to
[1:18:54] there to abraham in the
[1:18:55] in the plains of memory he had given him
[1:18:58] a promise and there he was faithfully
[1:19:00] believing it
[1:19:00] oh but he appeared unto him there
[1:19:03] melchizedek said according to the time
[1:19:05] of life
[1:19:05] thou shalt have a son
[1:19:08] so marvel to me that in that story sarah
[1:19:11] laughs but in this story
[1:19:13] this this lady also says to the prophet
[1:19:15] says oh
[1:19:18] man of god don't lie to me
[1:19:21] man of god don't lie to me why would i
[1:19:23] i'm my my husband's old i'm getting
[1:19:25] there in age and i've been barren
[1:19:27] why would you tell me that i'm going to
[1:19:28] have a son don't lie to me
[1:19:30] not that she was uh uh she she wasn't
[1:19:33] telling the prophet that he was lying
[1:19:35] almost something or her heart if i could
[1:19:38] say it like this would be
[1:19:39] oh let it be true let it be true don't
[1:19:42] lie to me
[1:19:43] and the prophet would say it like this
[1:19:45] he'd say and he said well
[1:19:46] just go in other words and you'll see
[1:19:50] just go on because he had already seen
[1:19:53] the vision
[1:19:54] it was all over oh if we could start to
[1:19:57] understand that there's already been a
[1:20:00] vision
[1:20:01] there's already been a word there's
[1:20:03] already been something that has come to
[1:20:05] the prophet of the hour
[1:20:07] and he has spoken a word concerning you
[1:20:09] and it's already
[1:20:10] all over you keep getting all worried
[1:20:13] you're getting all
[1:20:14] flustered that you're not seeing
[1:20:15] evidences and signs and things in your
[1:20:17] life
[1:20:18] but although it tarry don't worry it's
[1:20:21] going to come to pass
[1:20:22] that right season it will speak for
[1:20:24] itself you keep believing that word of
[1:20:26] promise
[1:20:29] i think of the scripture as we were just
[1:20:32] referring to john 5 19 it says
[1:20:35] that i have needs to go by samaria
[1:20:38] jonathan 5 19 he says i do nothing but
[1:20:41] what the father shows me
[1:20:42] i have needs to go by samaria well why
[1:20:45] was he going by samaria
[1:20:47] because now he had received a vision of
[1:20:49] the lord now for him to go into samaria
[1:20:52] because there was a predestinated seed
[1:20:54] there
[1:20:55] that he was going to harvest that he was
[1:20:57] going to bring to manifestation
[1:20:59] we know the story at the woman at the
[1:21:01] well we just continue here let's read
[1:21:03] out of daniel 12.
[1:21:05] it says in uh verse 8 it says and i
[1:21:07] heard but i understood not
[1:21:10] then said i oh my lord what shall be the
[1:21:13] end of these things and he said go thy
[1:21:15] way daniel
[1:21:17] for the words are closed up and sealed
[1:21:21] till the end time
[1:21:28] go thy way daniel for the words are
[1:21:30] closed up and sealed
[1:21:32] till the end time prophet of god is
[1:21:34] going to pick this up here and
[1:21:35] the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit
[1:21:37] to daniel in 61.
[1:21:42] he says the end time message
[1:21:45] shall reveal it the last church age
[1:21:48] glory
[1:21:50] there you are oh my it shakes me to
[1:21:52] think of it the mystery
[1:21:54] the things that the church world bats
[1:21:56] their eyes at and says it's nonsense
[1:21:58] the mystery of who jesus christ was not
[1:22:01] a third person
[1:22:02] not the second person not the third
[1:22:04] person
[1:22:05] but the person of god all these mr other
[1:22:08] mysteries of god
[1:22:09] will be revealed because it's wrote here
[1:22:11] in this book
[1:22:13] and be revealed to the end time
[1:22:15] generation
[1:22:16] they can no more see it in the
[1:22:18] seminaries and the schools and
[1:22:19] denominations
[1:22:20] then the jews could see jesus being the
[1:22:22] messiah
[1:22:24] no wonder they try to think you're crazy
[1:22:27] no wonder they think you're foolish no
[1:22:30] wonder they can't
[1:22:31] understand why you don't cluck up with
[1:22:34] them
[1:22:36] because there's a power and a vision
[1:22:39] behind it
[1:22:40] a word of god that's been revealed to
[1:22:43] get the church in order
[1:22:45] for the rapture and the going home oh
[1:22:48] there's a power
[1:22:49] and a vision behind you you're hearing
[1:22:52] what the prophet saying
[1:22:53] there is a power and a vision behind
[1:22:56] this word
[1:22:57] well what is the power what is the
[1:22:59] vision what is the word it's the
[1:23:00] revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:02] the very sealed book that had been
[1:23:04] hidden down through the ages
[1:23:06] what is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:08] when you get in there into the book of
[1:23:09] revelation which is the revelation
[1:23:12] what does the prophet start to talk
[1:23:13] about he starts to talk about something
[1:23:15] that is
[1:23:15] veiled and then it's unveiled and that's
[1:23:19] what's been unveiled in our day
[1:23:21] is jesus christ and that revealing comes
[1:23:24] with a power
[1:23:26] and a vision behind it you realize that
[1:23:28] there is a power
[1:23:29] and a vision behind you and that nothing
[1:23:32] is going to let that vision fail
[1:23:35] nothing when the prophet had that vision
[1:23:38] of the bride coming back around
[1:23:40] marching onward christian soldiers and
[1:23:42] there's a few just maybe
[1:23:44] getting back out of step he says oh get
[1:23:46] back in line get back in line
[1:23:48] oh we're marching onward christian
[1:23:50] soldiers we're marching forward
[1:23:51] victorious
[1:23:52] you've already been seen in the vision
[1:23:55] oh man
[1:23:56] i know about you that makes me happy
[1:23:59] that makes me excited to know that the
[1:24:02] things that i've seen in the word and
[1:24:04] the things that i've heard the prophet
[1:24:05] say
[1:24:06] that there's a power and a vision behind
[1:24:08] those things that's going to bring it to
[1:24:09] pass
[1:24:10] i'm rejoicing in that because where
[1:24:12] there is no vision the people perish
[1:24:14] but thank god i've received a vision
[1:24:16] thank god that i've received a word
[1:24:18] that's going to bring me back to where i
[1:24:20] came from
[1:24:22] oh we can just start thinking of certain
[1:24:24] types here in the scripture
[1:24:26] you know i was just thinking of how
[1:24:30] that scripture we just are laboring on
[1:24:32] where there's no vision the people
[1:24:34] perish
[1:24:35] and i i uh when i was picking out
[1:24:38] granite for my
[1:24:39] my house there for the kitchen island
[1:24:41] and you know for the countertops there
[1:24:43] you you go to all these
[1:24:44] uh uh granite stone yards where they
[1:24:47] have all these stones
[1:24:48] that are hewn out in it's just maybe an
[1:24:51] acre
[1:24:52] uh full of uh maybe a half acre some of
[1:24:55] them
[1:24:55] bigger than others but you just go and
[1:24:57] then there's all these stones that have
[1:24:59] been hewed out of the
[1:25:00] earth and you and you go look at all of
[1:25:03] them and they just
[1:25:04] my you just start to look at it you
[1:25:06] start to think how awesome that god is
[1:25:09] this stuff that was buried in the earth
[1:25:11] it's so beautiful
[1:25:13] and then maybe they they take that stone
[1:25:15] and they put it in the house and then
[1:25:17] they they polish it all up
[1:25:18] and boy it just looks so beautiful and
[1:25:20] you start to think
[1:25:21] my that this stone was elected
[1:25:25] this stone was chosen because
[1:25:29] this stone had a vision for it
[1:25:32] all of the other stone and all the other
[1:25:34] earth that was laid out there
[1:25:36] and i just started thinking of mighty
[1:25:38] angelo and how he had he'd gotten that
[1:25:40] stone there
[1:25:42] and what was he going to do he had a
[1:25:44] vision and he had something in his mind
[1:25:46] that he was going to shape and he wanted
[1:25:48] to bring that that stone into the form
[1:25:51] of moses
[1:25:53] and as brother billy had alluded to when
[1:25:55] he was preaching about the pattern of
[1:25:57] god
[1:25:57] talking about a remnant look it's all
[1:25:59] the same fabric but a pattern's laid out
[1:26:01] out over it
[1:26:02] and here the master he's taking that
[1:26:04] stone and he's shaping it into the
[1:26:06] image or the vision that he had in his
[1:26:08] mind
[1:26:10] think of that what what made this stone
[1:26:12] so special
[1:26:14] that it was predestinated that it was
[1:26:16] elected that god had a vision pertaining
[1:26:19] to it
[1:26:20] that he wanted to mold it and make it
[1:26:22] into something
[1:26:23] and we love how brother random takes
[1:26:25] that type there and he preaches the
[1:26:26] message the masterpiece
[1:26:28] and i'm just so thankful that i can look
[1:26:30] into the word and see myself
[1:26:31] standing there to know that god has had
[1:26:33] a vision pertaining to me
[1:26:35] that he's shaping me and that he's
[1:26:37] molding me and he he's working on me to
[1:26:39] bring me into that
[1:26:40] image that he's not gonna let me go to
[1:26:42] the wayside
[1:26:43] i'm not like all the other religions and
[1:26:45] denominations and all those
[1:26:46] that have rejected the word but we say
[1:26:48] lord if it's hard if it's
[1:26:50] cutting lord jesus whatever you would
[1:26:52] have for me lord i believe it if you
[1:26:53] gotta
[1:26:54] take the the the the block and knock it
[1:26:56] this way and knock off this corner
[1:26:58] and you gotta get out the chisel and you
[1:27:00] gotta crack this over here
[1:27:01] lord whatever it is that you have to do
[1:27:03] to me lord be it unto me according to
[1:27:05] thy word
[1:27:12] the prophet of god says in the
[1:27:14] masterpiece he says
[1:27:16] if the bride in the beginning was the
[1:27:18] word or the bridegroom
[1:27:19] then if the bride is taken from the
[1:27:21] bridegroom it must be the word also
[1:27:24] notice the bride must be why why must
[1:27:27] the bridegroom
[1:27:28] be the word manifested made plain is
[1:27:30] because the bride and the bridegroom are
[1:27:32] one
[1:27:33] she's just smit a smitten piece of him
[1:27:37] there's the masterpiece it was smitten
[1:27:39] mikey angelo could not reproduce that
[1:27:41] again
[1:27:42] he could not put it back but god is
[1:27:44] going to do it
[1:27:46] he's going to bring this little bride
[1:27:48] that's spitting right back to the side
[1:27:50] of the original word
[1:27:52] and there he is there's the masterpiece
[1:27:55] the family back in the garden of eden
[1:27:58] oh you realize that you're his vision
[1:28:03] you are the vision of god
[1:28:08] you are the word of god made flesh
[1:28:11] in this hour the very thoughts of god
[1:28:14] being expressed but all we just see all
[1:28:16] the hard work
[1:28:18] we see all the flesh man we see all we
[1:28:21] see that gap we see all the
[1:28:22] insufficiencies
[1:28:24] oh but if we could just stay focused on
[1:28:26] what god is doing
[1:28:27] as the musicians come we'll find a place
[1:28:29] to to finish
[1:28:38] as i was just thinking about this
[1:28:42] pondering you you're his vision
[1:28:46] i'm his vision
[1:28:49] with all of this with all these failures
[1:28:54] with all of this gross darkness with
[1:28:56] what i did last week and what i did
[1:28:58] three weeks ago lord how could i be your
[1:29:01] vision
[1:29:03] how could i be your vision that you're
[1:29:05] wanting to have in this last days
[1:29:07] when i see all my faults and failures
[1:29:12] this bag of bones you mean lord you
[1:29:15] you've called me
[1:29:16] you've elected me you've chosen me
[1:29:20] this sinful nature this is what your
[1:29:23] vision was
[1:29:24] well you're not looking through the eyes
[1:29:27] of god
[1:29:28] you're not looking through the blood
[1:29:30] you're not looking from that vision or
[1:29:32] from that high spot
[1:29:34] where god had a perfect picture of you
[1:29:36] and now he's bringing that
[1:29:38] perfect picture into that full
[1:29:39] manifestation
[1:29:41] i think of that the the the scripture
[1:29:44] there i believe in
[1:29:44] ezekiel it says can these dry bones live
[1:29:48] what this bag of bones this flesh man
[1:29:52] can i live can i manifest this message
[1:29:54] okay can these bag of bones live son of
[1:29:56] man
[1:29:57] oh what did he say he said thou knowest
[1:30:01] and what did he tell the prophet he said
[1:30:03] prophesy
[1:30:05] he told him to speak the word and when
[1:30:07] he spoke the word all of a sudden
[1:30:10] as that word and that vision was uttered
[1:30:12] all of a sudden out there all of those
[1:30:14] dry bones
[1:30:16] oh they started to wake up out of the
[1:30:18] dust they started to wake up
[1:30:20] out of the earth all this sinew and the
[1:30:22] flesh all started to come upon
[1:30:23] him and they started to stand up and
[1:30:25] that fourth messenger that life
[1:30:27] messenger
[1:30:28] breathed the word into him oh and they
[1:30:30] became a victorious army
[1:30:34] they started walking in the vision why
[1:30:37] because
[1:30:38] the word had come to the prophet and he
[1:30:41] had spoken the word
[1:30:51] i love this out of the church age book
[1:30:54] let's all just stand
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:04] i think about it
[1:31:09] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:31:16] this day this scripture is fulfilled god
[1:31:18] has come
[1:31:20] in the last days and he has spoken
[1:31:24] a word concerning you
[1:31:27] a word that cannot fail and there in the
[1:31:30] church age book he says in very plain
[1:31:32] language the true bride of christ was in
[1:31:34] the mind of god eternally
[1:31:36] though not expressed until each age came
[1:31:38] forth in the designated season
[1:31:41] decreed season as each member came forth
[1:31:44] it became expressed and took its place
[1:31:46] in the body
[1:31:47] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:31:49] word seed bride
[1:31:51] and though she is feminine in
[1:31:52] designation she is also called the body
[1:31:54] of christ
[1:31:56] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:31:58] called that
[1:31:59] for she was predestinated in him
[1:32:02] came from the same source was eternal
[1:32:05] with him
[1:32:06] and is now manifesting god in a
[1:32:08] mini-member body
[1:32:10] whereas once god was manifested to one
[1:32:12] member even our lord jesus christ
[1:32:15] oh i think of the scripture here in
[1:32:17] ephesians 5 it says
[1:32:19] husbands love your wives as christ has
[1:32:21] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:32:23] that he verse 26 that he might sanctify
[1:32:27] it
[1:32:28] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:32:30] water by the word
[1:32:32] that he might do it
[1:32:35] the word that's be revealed in this hour
[1:32:38] is none other than jesus christ taking
[1:32:39] his bride
[1:32:42] washing you cleansing you
[1:32:46] sanctifying you he's justified you
[1:32:50] he's glorifying you he's saying come on
[1:32:53] unto me all ye who are heavy laden
[1:32:56] and i'll give you rest don't worry about
[1:32:58] all the trials don't worry about all the
[1:33:00] problems
[1:33:01] i understand that you don't have enough
[1:33:02] oil in the cruise i understand that you
[1:33:04] don't have enough meal to bake
[1:33:06] but i'm just asking you to give me up my
[1:33:08] portion first just come unto me all year
[1:33:11] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[1:33:13] because what am i doing that i might
[1:33:15] present
[1:33:16] paul says that he might present it to
[1:33:18] himself a glorious church
[1:33:21] not having spot or wrinkle
[1:33:24] or any such thing but that it should be
[1:33:26] holy and without blame
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:30] and without blemish
[1:33:33] oh thank you lord thank you lord that
[1:33:36] this is the vision
[1:33:38] that i'm holy
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:42] without blame before i'm in love
[1:33:46] i just want to close if you'll just
[1:33:47] listen to this last statement here
[1:33:50] things that are to be it's a perfect
[1:33:53] place calling you to that perfection
[1:33:57] and you have to be perfect to get there
[1:33:59] the bible says so jesus said be
[1:34:01] therefore perfect even as your heavenly
[1:34:03] father
[1:34:04] in heaven is perfect it's a perfect
[1:34:07] kingdom
[1:34:08] so it must be a perfect people come
[1:34:11] now not quit looking at the negative
[1:34:14] this is the vision
[1:34:16] and the word of the lord coming to you
[1:34:18] to tell you that you are a perfect
[1:34:19] people
[1:34:21] coming to a perfect kingdom because you
[1:34:24] have to stand to be married to a perfect
[1:34:26] son of god
[1:34:28] and you must be a perfect bride
[1:34:31] so how can you do it through anything
[1:34:33] else but the perfect word of god
[1:34:36] which is the waters of separation that
[1:34:39] washes us from our sins amen that's
[1:34:41] right
[1:34:42] the blood of jesus christ think of it
[1:34:44] the dripping
[1:34:45] bloody word amen the blood the word
[1:34:49] of god bleeding blood to wash the bride
[1:34:51] in amen
[1:34:52] yes sir she stands perfect
[1:34:57] virgin unadulterated she never sinned
[1:35:00] in the first place amen oh i believe
[1:35:03] we're living in an hour
[1:35:04] where there's a bride that can read that
[1:35:06] right there and the prophet of god
[1:35:08] said here is the vision here's the word
[1:35:12] of the lord and he says
[1:35:13] she stands perfect
[1:35:16] i believe there's a bride here tonight
[1:35:19] that can say
[1:35:19] this day this scripture is fulfilled oh
[1:35:23] the devil wants me to back down off of
[1:35:25] that
[1:35:25] well i'm waiting for this to catch up
[1:35:27] over there i'm waiting for these things
[1:35:29] to happen
[1:35:30] i'm waiting to see these certain
[1:35:31] manifestations in my life
[1:35:33] no i'm not looking at my ideas i'm not
[1:35:36] looking at my vision
[1:35:38] that's what jesus christ came to do he
[1:35:40] came to
[1:35:41] sanctify you and paired you from all of
[1:35:43] your ideas
[1:35:44] he came to take away your vision that
[1:35:46] you had he came to take away what you
[1:35:48] thought you were going to do
[1:35:50] and he came to give you his mind he came
[1:35:52] to give you his word
[1:35:54] he came to reveal his vision that was
[1:35:56] written
[1:35:57] in that mystery that was hidden before
[1:36:00] the foundation of the world
[1:36:02] and now you're just finding out who you
[1:36:03] really are that you can manifest what's
[1:36:06] been spoken
