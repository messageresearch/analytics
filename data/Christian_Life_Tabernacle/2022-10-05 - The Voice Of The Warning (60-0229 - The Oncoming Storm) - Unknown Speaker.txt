the trouble that it is uh getting out to the house of the Lord but thank you Brothers but I'm certainly know the Lord will bless you I felt in my heart tonight to play 43 minutes about 48 minutes out of the message the oncoming storm um I I think it's appropriate with the great storms that we we just had they had a picture of a lady and she's standing in her kitchen and the waters up above her counter and she's sitting there with the water right up in her West waist probably about as high as this pulpit and water and she makes the comment she says next time I'll listen and I I just think that this tape is wonderful it's preached in 1960. but if I was to even express it to you this way I'd like to say the voice of the warning the voice of the warning and you know we find out that just like at Pearl Harbor all the signs were there but they they were they were partying you know what I mean and and they they failed to take the time to consider it we have the saying that we use they just blew it off and the same thing with the church uh the the church uh uh they just uh you know they they were just having a big Revival and everything was a Revival and you know that that's what the church was in a Revival Revival and they everything was fine and they were growing and their buildings were being built and they were full of people but what happens is is they forgot the voice of the warning they forgot what the warning told them was going to happen he said your morals are going to fall apart you're you're you're not going to hold the people you don't have the word they just failed to hear the voice of the warning and and and what happened all the conditions that the warning warned us of have all showed up all happened just the way that we were warned to and and uh and I'd like to make this statement because what's happened is is that that when once you fail to hear the voice of the warning then you failed to make the preparations and go to the place of safety and uh and and but it's going to happen just the way that it's spoken so I'd like to read this statement before we listen to the tape if you have your Bibles and you will turn to Matthew the seventh chapter and starting in the the 24th verse of the seventh chapter of Matthew and what we can do is uh uh when it comes time to read that uh portion of scripture we can just stand at that time and listen to that portion of scripture and then when the prophet of God's finished reading that we can sit down but I'd like to read this statement because I'd like you to catch it as we listen to it so how many understands there's an oncoming storm right there's a voice of the preparation okay it doesn't matter if you know the storms coming that's not what you're measured by you're measured by the preparation that you made and what does the voice listen to this statement that our Messengers making because he's making this to the church world he's starting to tell the church world it's coming make preparation and there's a voice of warning or the voice of preparation he says it pays to take warning the first thing to do before there can be a warning there has to be a preparation made for safety or there's no need to send a warning there has to be a preparation made for safety or there's no need to send a warning and the warning is only a voice of one having you prepare for the danger there has to be a preparation made first and then if the preparation is made then the warning can go forward to cause you to make your decision whether you want to listen to it or not let me tell you people are choosing not to listen they like the doctrines they like the teachings they like the Miracles but they failed to miss they failed to hear what he was warning if you don't want to listen to it well that's up to you if you do listen to it there is safety God has a method he works on God's method in that way God in the early days when the Andalusian world when people had gotten so wicked and so sinful that God could not look upon it and be just God is just and he has laws and when those laws are broken and the law that's broken has no penalty to it it isn't a law you cannot break the laws of God without having to pay for it somewhere you must do it the Bible said so be sure your sins will find you out he makes this final statement I think even when we have too much practice on sermons and not living enough sermon I would be a lot better if we lived our sermon each one of us would be a minister it's better to live me a sermon than preach me one the Bible said you are written Epistles of God read of all men see it's just best to live the sermon so I think it's best for us to live out the warning so as we listen to this 48 minutes of this message put it in the context this is a messenger speaking out about an oncoming storm he's warning the church of the spiritual condition that they're heading to and there's a consequence for not hearing it work we're 50 years after the warning that went out in the message of the hour and are we ever seeing the fruits of it alive today I know you will enjoy this 48 minutes we just sit back we'll listen to it take it in for yourself examine yourself and ask yourself am I making preparation based on the voice of the warning am I making preparation because remember the voice is there to warn you of the place of safety we know our place of safety don't we it's the what the word amen God bless you I felt led to play this tonight I hope it's a blessing to you let us turn now in our Bibles quickly through the seventh chapter of Saint Matthew and we let's begin reading at the 24th first therefore whosoever every year these things of mine and doeth them I will liken him into a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat up on the house and it fell not for it was founded up on a rock and everyone they Hearth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened into a foolish man which built his house upon the Sands and the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat up on the house and fell and great was the fall of it may the Lord had his Blessings Now to the reading of his words I wish to speak for a few moments upon the subject of the oncoming storm and I've trusted God that we will be able to yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit for anyone knows that I'm not a preacher that's there's preachers behind me here I never got the education to be a minister but and my old slow ways but I the lord gave me something else to do but I love to take a time so I can explain what I know about the Lord and and about his goodness and trying to tell others about it and now we are speaking tonight on the coming storm and if I fail in words to express what I feel in my heart I pray the Holy Spirit Will Reveal it foreign Jesus was speaking here of a coming storm which has got to strike every man and every woman is born in the world there's just no way out of it that star will strike you sometime our other and it depends on what kind of a foundation that you have whether your house will weather it or not there's been many lives saved because of preparation for storms and there's been a many a life's loss because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming not long ago I was told of a story that happened I believe I read it in a newspaper down in Florida they have many great storms that sweeps through Florida typhoons that come in off the sea and brings the water for city blocks up into the City and sweeps out everything and I'm told that their weather prophets are always on the lookout for such storms and some way through the the elements that they can contact the changing of the weather and the atmosphere that which away this weather is gathering that'll bring forth one of those storms because they've made it a life study and by certain instruments and things that science has provided them and then by calling ahead and hearing of which away the storm's coming how much wind it's got behind him which way other storms are coming of winds whether it's able to combat to shove away the storm I could stop here and preach for hour on that that it takes a greater storm that's coming it takes a higher wind to turn that storm so is it today and we all know that we've got an oncoming storm I'm the only wind I know that can turn that storm will be that Russian wind that fell on the day of Pentecost I'm told that there's men even in the city now speaking against communism and they should be but just speaking against it isn't enough we've got to find how to turn the thing and then there is only one thing that can turn that storm and that's a more powerful storm that can be said it and change its course and these prophets saw the weather in Florida are pretty accurate with their prophesying they are set forth that purpose to warn the people I was reading or forget just now I believe it was in a newspaper of a storm a few years ago that was on its way across Florida Central Florida and all the regions around Okeechobee was was worn I just left there about five weeks ago and there was a neighbor man who kept in contact with radio all the time because of these storms and he was a very renowned Christian and he heard that the great Thai food was coming that way twisting down trees and everyone was born to get to safety and he thought of his neighbor who had a chicken farm and some light buildings with their chickens in them their brooder houses and so forth and their pins were all that they had in life was tied up with these chickens other living and he rushed quickly frantically up to the gate and stopped his car and jumped out and said to this fella take all the chickens and put them in your storm shelter and you rush over to mine because there is coming a typhoon or a storm that's going to twist everything down and the man stood and looked him in the face and laughed at him and said nonsense I've heard them predict such things before and it never did happen and the Christian neighbor was so excited he said but what if it does happen we hear remarks like that along the line I've heard of this is going to happen that's going to happen but it is going to happen one of these days and it behooves us to listen to every warning but this man said I have no time for such foolishness I raise chickens and I have no time for such any cried out the neighbor said in the name of God he said leave those chickens alone to him John and come quickly you and your family if you don't want to believe it let your family come and he said I will not have my children to be excited over a few radio warnings my children I have decided will live as I live and my wife will listen to me because I am the breadwinner of this home and she must listen to me I'm Bossier and I will not have my children all excited or tore up about some nonsense and the neighbor was turned and he went to his home into his shelter and all of a sudden the cloud was up on him before they knew it that's the way judgment strikes it comes so sudden you'll wonder how I can get there so quick I have seen cruel man who once cursed God fall and scream and say how could you treat me this way a whole every Foundation must swept out from under him in a moment it pays to take warning oh you might laugh at the messenger you might be able even to kill him but you cannot kill the message go on just the same God's message is eternal his words will never fail Paul was successfully in heaven Stephen stoned but all to his life until he surrendered to Christ was he never able to get away from that message I see Heavens open and Jesus standing on the right hand of God something got a hold of him it wasn't the messenger it was a message he had while the storms swept through the country it caught the chicken house and the farmer and they never found his body and his wife frantically fighting and so they live close to the great Okeechobee Lake and the waters begin to rise as the typhoon lifted the waters all the way from the bottom of the lake that's what makes them so dangerous they're shallow the boats Rock and that's how the waves come up and turn the boats beneath them the storms comes and just whirls up the water and packs it for miles and the water sweeping until the mother no there was no hope but to get her children home top of the building and she got her children and got them on top of the building holding on to the chimney of the house and then the wildlife the cottonmouth moccasin I believe a more deadly snake in your Diamondback rattler they was calling for safety and they come on the roof with her I'm about to listen to her husband not taking heed to the warning she had to she stomped and she beat but she had to stand and watch those vicious snakes bite her children until they died on the roof and the mother herself Was Bitten so much until finally she died that's the only way we got the story at the storm had quietened and the search parties hunting for bodies and so forth they found her laying on top of the roof with her children laying by her side oh it pays to take warning the first thing to do before there can be a warning there has to be a preparation made for safety or there's no need of sending a warning and the warning is only a voice of one having you to prepare for the danger there has to be a preparation made first and then if the preparation is made then the warning can go forward to cause you to make your decision whether you want to listen to it or not if you don't want to listen to it well that's up to you if you do listen to it there's safety God has the same method we work on God's method in that way God in the early days when the antelopean world when people had gotten so wicked and so sinful that God could not look upon it and be just God is just and he has laws when those laws are broken and in law that's broken has no penalty to it isn't law you cannot break the laws of God without having to pay part somewhere you must do it the Bible said be sure your sins will find you out what is sin I'd like to stop here just a moment many people think smoking cigarettes is a sin it isn't many people think that lying is the sin it isn't committing adultery that isn't sin that's the attributes of unbelief you the reason you do those things is because you are an unbeliever there's only two things that's you are either a Believer or an unbeliever if you are a Believer you do not those things if you do do them I don't know what kind of profession you have but if you do that the love of God isn't in you the Bible said so we've got too much profession without a possession of it too many saying and not living it I think even we have too much practice on sermons and not living enough sermons it'll be a lot better if we lived our sermon each one of us would be a minister it's better to leave me a sermon than preach me one the Bible said that your written Epistles of God read of all man so it's best to live the sermon sin is because you believe not did not Jesus say in the days of his flesh on Earth did he not call the people that would not lie that would not steal that would not commit adultery righteous man preachers priests he said you are of your father the devil because they believe not on the son of God he that believeth not is condemned already some time ago I made it making Alder calls I love John 5 24. he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me as eternal life and shall not come into judgment but it's passing death in the light he that believer he said that's pretty light no that's pretty deep for when you believe no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit when you have the Holy Spirit then you have believed on eternal life and have eternal life either Hearth my words and believeth on him it sent me has eternal life and shall not come into the Judgment that's passed from Death unto life preparation making ready and God seemed the wickedness of the world I am seeing that Wicked and adulterous generation and his holiness could not stand it anymore oh to this sinful world I stopped the other day on my road to the grocery with my wife and we were talking about a certain young lady of our city real cold weather and with the little chubby coat on and dressed in Marley with those little sharks on it they wear in the summertime and it will skip the snow on the ground and my wife said you know that woman can't be comfortable and I said no she's just not in her right mind and she said well you know she goes to high school now I said she might go to high school but that still doesn't make everything right I said she cannot be mentally right when we go into Germany I was in Germany sometime ago in a great meeting where the Lord was giving us around around ten thousand Souls a night and I was so amazed one night when I come from the meeting at a I'm down the street to a place where I was invited for a little luncheon and it was closing all the needy and all the Christians sitting around drinking beer well America Canada and England is the only Nations I know that refuses the Christians to drink they don't get drunk but we Americans then when I didn't drink it so after all there come a question around the table what was the matter that I wasn't drinking my beer was it because it wasn't good and Dr gookenview sitting next to me which provided me an interpreter I said what they all mermaid about to me and he sat there wondering why you don't drink now I know it's written when you're in Rome be a Roman but I said tell them this I do not condemn them but I was born under a Nazarite birth I'm not supposed to drink I didn't want to hurt them I'm they understood it went right on drinking and then in Italy we found almost the same thing and many different parts of the world when you go into the Nations you find the spirit of the nation I remember the Holy Spirit give me a warning not to go to the YMCA in Finland I didn't know why it was about come to find out they had bath women there when I stayed away and I would not go in with Dr munion and then as far as swim and I found out those scrub women scrubbed the man and I said that's not right well he said brother Brennan that's just as much right as your nurses isn't in the United States said they're trained for that I said I don't care how much you're trained it never was intended that way but I'm covering them up and made them different right but they pay no attention to it they were thins wonderful people but it's a spear of the nation wherever you go you find the spirit of a Nation you come to America you've really had it then that's the worst of all and my wife said to me while those people go to church and I've often wondered why it didn't condemn their conscience I said my dear wife let me tell you they are Americans she said well Walmart we ought to know I said we just live here but we've been born from above the holy spirit of God come upon us therefore we are pilgrims and strangers here this is not our Abiding Place but we are seeking a city to come whose Builder and maker is God therefore when you're born of above you have a holy spirit coming down from God that changes your nature no matter your sister your mother your your best friend could be it dressed that way but the Christian that's barned of the spirit of God is born from above and their spirit is of another kingdom oh I'm so glad at that the simpleness of the Holy Spirit to follow it and watch it how it behaves makes you behave that's the way it was in the days of Noah and God got so filled up in it but before he sent a storm to destroy the entire world God made preparation for those who wanted to stay out of it and I can see Noah standing in the door of the Ark preaching righteousness oh there wasn't many would listen at him there was something like today they want entertainment not the gospel woe unto these Hollywood evangelists who's afraid to call Sin Sin we need some of the old-fashioned Backwoods preachers that's got the Holy Spirit that's not afraid to preach the gospel with their bare hands not covered up with some kind of a rubber glove but preach the coming of the Lord Jesus judgment for the wicked heaven for the righteous and the near approaching what season I don't know and no one else knows but I'll warn my generation if it comes now I want them to be warned I can see no way in that door of the very heart oh I just like to believe one thing it wasn't that way but Noah standing in that door the only way to safety I can see Moses later standing in the door with blood on the little preaching judgment with the blood on the limb today Jesus is the door to the Sheepfold Ministers of the Gospel standing in that door pleading with the congregation to come to safety no doubt but what there was many laughed at Noah made fun of and the Bible said they were scoffers I can just hear them say something like this Noah if you haven't got some better entertainment than that we'll just stay home the world today America doesn't want the gospel they want entertainment they've got to have something to entertain them a lot of fancy music or something like that or some kind of a party some kind of a wiener roast but stem things are all right outside the church but the churches or judgmental to be preached in the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and a warning judgment begins at the house of God not parties judgment lot was born I am when the Angels told that he didn't know they were angels when they went down their message was to Sodom come out of this sinful place God has provided a way of Escape for you come out of the sinful Place Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom look what kind of a life they were living and Jesus compared that day with this day sinful watch when lot went to tell his people they laughed at him made fun of him and the sins of the city vexed his righteous soul the Angel's message didn't stare them had no effect on him but they were asked to come out because judgment was upon the city and God was going to bring a storm of fire upon the city and they refused to walk they refused to come out they were satisfied with their sins people today seem to be so comfortable in sin because we own a new car because we could eat three meals a day sleep on a clean bed that's wonderful but that would be good but we forget Godwin Prosperity comes like that I think we've been so we preachers and we Christians has been so interested in and the program of filling our churches and getting a better church or something like that or a bigger Church better pews or you know harm what I mean and we've left off the main thing judgment righteousness power of the Holy Ghost Resurrection Eternal judgment the angel never failed to preach the message although they tried to stop him but their message went on just the same now did you notice it's just like a man that says I'm going to refuse to believe the sons are Shining I will have nothing else to do with the sun closes his eyes and goes down in his basement of his house and said I just refused and all the sons are Shining well you say brother Branham that man would be something mentally wrong with him well a man that would reject Jesus Christ has the same grounds the holy spirit is more real than the sunshine son will fail but the Holy Spirit can't fail it don't only light for the sense of sight but it lights for the soul of a light of Glory that leads us to God that rejects our projects rather Calvary to us and the sufferings of the Lord Jesus the oncoming judgment and the Escape for those who want to come I'd rather be totally blind physical and have my spiritual sight then to be totally blind spiritual and have my physical side I want to have spiritual sight notice what would be wrong with that man those his friends would come and say Jim John or whatever his name might be you are wrong come out of that old dingy basement musty he would stand and say I'll tell you I'm satisfied where I am he doesn't want the the welcome Sunshine he doesn't want his healing rays he doesn't want his Beauty it's it's warm for his life something could be wrong with the man and so is a man or a woman who wants to stay in the dingy world shut up in the musty sin of unbelief and say in the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as Divine Healing there's no Holy Ghost it's because you're refusing to come out of the must and the dens of the devil and of the hell and of seeing and of pride walk in the light of the Gospel which will bring you warmth oh how comfortable it is to see the oncoming judgments and feel that Comfort feeling of the Holy Spirit hear them talk of atomic bombs and just think what's happening a peace that passes understanding while the bomb won't no more go out of the gun until we will be in the presence of Jesus for the eternal life we owe people back young again the baby's up to an age with no more death or sorrow oh what a wonderful thing you mean a man would refuse to come out and walk in that there's something wrong with him finally if he doesn't get the sunlight he turns pale it gets real pale sick sets in on him that's what's the matter with the world today that's what's the matter with the most of our churches today We are Becoming anemia we need a blood transfusion pale because we are failing our spiritual health is failing us we don't have the Zeal no more to hunt Souls to warn people to get our neighbors to get our friends the Milkman the paper boy whatever it is get someone to the Lord Jesus we're pale failing to walk out in the light because it's our privilege failing to believe in the health of God by Divine Healing I'm told in the Bible there will be a time come for those who are not in this wonderful sunlight thousands of the air will eat the Flesh of them that diseases is on this road that the doctors will never be able to stop it's the plagues of God the Egyptians doctors which was Far smarter than ours today could not stop the plagues of God neither could they sue Sayers or their impersonators it took the ocean and the power of God to hold his people under the blood of a lamb the holy spirit is that door today the holy spirit is at safety today I was in a meeting not long ago I'm looking at a a colored brother sitting here I suppose him and his wife and I've been watching since I've been preaching nodding his head and rejoicing in the meeting it just brought me to a a thought there's a boy come into the meeting one time and as soon as the service is over he he ran to me and he said Parson he was a southerner and he said Parson as wants to find the law Jesus tonight us having a healing service and I said certainly my brother I am more than happy to lead you to him he said actually he gave his heart to the Lord he said I wonder I guess you're wondering why I run up out here like this that I heard you were in the city and I just come up to see what to see you he said I'll tell you my story he said I've more or less been a Wonder said my own mother was a real Christian my sisters was Christian I had one Christian brother he said I was the baby of the family and a spoiled child to begin with because a baby in me but still good to me but said I would not take heed to my mother are my Godly relation I wanted to be a Wanderer I want to live a man's life he said I thought that being a Christian is more like for the women or the weak he said and I become a cook and I was very good at my period and said something another I want to go to the north and one day I staggered in on a pulp camp where they were cutting pop wood and I was broke and I said to the foreman could you use a cook he told his recommendations that he had in his pocket from different great places where he had been a chef and he said well we have one now he said but however until you're able to get around we can give you a little bit of money on the sun we got an elderly colored woman in there now which is a good chef but go and talk with her maybe she could use you and she could we can give you a little spending money till you get on your feet he said that was as good as he wanted and said he went in there and he met the old woman and said he helped her around for two or three days one night said he was laying there and he said he kept noticing the flashes across the side of the wall and after a while he wondered if that is somebody outside and said after a while he heard a a deep Roar and it was a thunder he said outside heard some voices talking and they said you know we better get back to the horses and take care of them because we may not be here very long said he took the cover off his head listened up to the wall and the lightning flashed and he saw his boss in the teamsters and he understood by their talk if there was coming a storm across the mountains which we call up in the Northlands a northerner comes quickly without warning you don't have time to do nothing the mountains are so high they just break right over at once and that flashing had been lightning and he said you know we may not be here after a while so that sounds like a terrible twister coming and then he said I begin to think well I hope it doesn't strike here said because I know I'm not ready to go and sometimes you wait too long you know so then he said just a few moments the wind began to blow and the trees begin to rock and said he listened the canvas was between he and worthy the old lady slept and said she was beating on that camera she said son or son he said yes she said would you come over to my son I have a lantern lit and said I went over to her because I was scared to death and said she had a laner sitting on an old soapbox and she said I'd like to ask you something said yes ma'am is that is you ready to meet the Lord he said then I really got scared said no ma'am I'm not well she said honey I want to tell you something you'd better make ready now cause you may have to meet him I'm prepared in the next few minutes said she said will you kneel with me here said we knelt down to the side of that old soapbox he said Parson I'm going to tell you the truth I still scared to pray he said the trees are slamming against that building and the lightning of flashing the Thunders and shaking I was too scared to pray I said I start to say Lord be merciful and bang with all the lightning I'd say what was that Lord be merciful obey with all the lightning he said but I learned a lesson he said that old sainted woman said Justice cool and happy as she could be said she talked to him like she had known him since she was a baby like he was her father or a mother said she was no more Disturbed and nothing said I was scared to death said finally I got these words out and I said Lord if you just let me live and I'll find a place where it's more quieter I'll come to you he got another chance but you might not when the judgments of God begin to pour out there's no more chance you've got your chance now this is your chance the storm was on him he said Parson is it possible for a man like me to be tucked away in that safety [Music] and when death begins to come upon me that I can interrupt to talk to him like that Old Saint did I said Son the blood of Jesus Christ that made her that way can make you that way right now [Music] I was standing by my automobile s found his knees in the muddy yard there he found that hiding place that refuge in a time of storm that rock in a weary land you don't have to be weary as long as you're in the rock the rock is one place that's not weary the rock is a satisfying place you can just sit back and look out just as safe as you can be there is our coming and now he is and the ceiling is about over that where every man and woman on the face of the Earth is going to be in that place of Refuge like it was in the days of Noah are on the outside of it you have to make your decision that safety is Jesus Christ that he is the only place the only one who has eternal life no man can come to the father but by him he is the Ark of our safety the Holy Spirit Bears record with us now that we pass from Death unto life and when we look at the grave and know that each one of us is going there we see the newspapers and the oncoming storm when you go home tonight do me one favor don't go to bed till you read Revelations the eighth chapter you see the oncoming plagues and storm that still hit the earth and Thunders and Lightnings are going to shake the heavens woes are going to pass over the nation man will rot in their flesh diseases of strike that the doctors knows nothing about but remember before that took place there was a ceiling went forth and the death angels and the plagues was commissioned by God don't come near any of those who has a seal in their forehead and the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit Ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption no matter how hard the art rocked no matter how many times the lightning struck close to ten thousand shall fall on your right and thousands to your left and it shall come not 90. the Holy Spirit I'll read about pale horse rider going out which is called death and Hell Followed him a black horse rider with a balance in his hand a measure of wheat for a penny two measures of body for a penny but don't come near my wine or my arm I hear by the Bible God's oncoming judgments or sickness and trouble and disaster will strike the nations in every nation will break to pieces I read in the Bible everything was quiet but the Lord Jesus peeled back the darkness from his eyes and he grabbed the mayor of the city and screamed I can see I can see one thousand standing there in muhammadans and so forth I said now what is the Ark of Safety I said I read in your paper the other day where did all the little birds that used to roost in the Rocks around the fence and in the big towers of the buildings of the corner you know what India is a poor country and they pick up the rocks on the field and make their fences and the little birds feel their nest in these rocks the crevices and then the holes they go into there and make their nests to get out of the rain and then the cattle all of an afternoon when the Sun goes across towards the West while the cattle stands in the shade of these uh these certain fences and big towers to get in the shade but for about two days the strangest thing happened all the little birds got their babies they're little baby birds all together and flew away from the walls and didn't even return back at night they went out in the middle of the field and set out the cattle would not come up in the afternoon they stayed away from the walls and got together and stood so close together that they made shade one for another brother sister that's what the church ought to do we don't need the shade of these towering bablens today of modernism we need the blessings of each other together love and Brotherhood Shadow brought in our heart by the Holy Ghost that makes this I take my brother by the hand my sister by the hand and know that we are citizens of the kingdom of God that we love one another and we stand together in this one great cause the cause of Christ whether you're a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian one to student is threeness whatever you are it makes no difference as long as the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and we have Fellowship one with another that's what we want Brotherhood Fellowship they stood in the fields they refused to stand in the shadow of the walls the people thought that was strange it is a strange Act what happened all of us all of us earthquake That Shook the walls to the ground if the little birds would have been in there they and their babies would have been like the woman her husband and her babies in Miami all right Okeechobee they would have died but the falling of the walls if the cattle would have stood around to take that support from the walls they would have perished with the walls that's been three years ago I've got the newspaper clip no Tommy Nichols has it now for the Christian man's voice the headlines in the paper says the birds are returning back to their places the cattle is coming from the field if the god in the days of Moses in the days of Noah could warn the cattle and the birds to come into safety in the ark destruction was coming a storm he's still the same God tonight he still loves cattle and birds and if he made a way for a bird and a cow to escape the wrath of judgment how much more has he made a way of Escape for you and I who are the offsprings of his creation how much more has it made a way of Escape for us we feel the Holy Spirit tugging at our heart the hour is coming we see the Shadows of the the atomic age we see the Shadows of the hazard and age we see nations are breaking Israel Awakening nations are breaking Israel's Awakening the signs that the prophets foretold the Gentile days numbered with Horrors encumbered return o disperse to your own that's the way today you all know Haywood's old song the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your Lance trimmed and clear look up your Redemption is near the storms are coming there's a hiding place oh a blessed hiding place it's in Christ let us bow our heads just a moment I hope that you were moved the way I was now I want you to this is like a prophecy storms in Florida right what are they talking about now atomic bombs nuclear Russia everything so my question is tonight and and we're Believers but if I would ask you this and and you were to come with an answer what did the prophet warn us about okay see we can look at the blessings we can look at the teachings we can be excited about everything and just what he what he said and he and he said this he said people today are be comfortable he said they got prosperity we're we're preachers and we're Christians have been and programs of building this and doing that we have all those things he said but we've left off the main thing and this is what he said he says or you know what I mean and we've left off the main thing judgment righteousness the power of the Holy Ghost resurrection and eternal judgment and so I I just thought in my heart I couldn't believe how that so many things he was saying actually literally applied right to where we're at storm in Florida warning in nuclear trouble in every way everybody after entertainment lawlessness and then I sit back and I said how aware am I of what brother random warned us about am I am am I conscious and and been listening and understand what is he warning us about and it's very striking when you start going through and see what he warned what the church would be what they would start leaving off but things they wouldn't have in their gospel anymore and if he just and he warns it and and everybody's excited about this excited about that and they forgot the warning they forgot what he warned in so I I just thought tonight we've listened to the voice of the warning it behooves us to take it to our heart to listen to the preparation and understand with all our heart what it is that he's warning let's don't miss the warning it goes the warning goes with the blessings but let's be aware of what he warned us about and don't let anything sneak up on us or get us or or mysteriously when you hear the word of God is that preaching the main thing is it pointing to the voice of the hour is it letting us know there's a voice of judgment and a warning let's stay right with the word of God just the way it was brought to us and I think it was great did you enjoy that tonight I I certainly did I was amazed at you would have thought he was preaching this right today but that's a voice of warning he says what great does it do if he doesn't provide a place of safety and we have a place of safety it's the ark and that's the message of the hour God bless you let's stand together I hope it's a blessing I hope it's not too late tonight uh for the service but just a 48 or so minute message 42 minutes a very wonderful uh let's Bauer heads and and ask the Lord to bless us and maybe you ask yourself in your own heart this evening and you'd say Lord maybe I've got a little Lacks and I forgot that there's a warning I I've I forgot to look around it to see the signs of the time Mark I've I I'm not as careful to see what's creeping in and slipping in of what I've been warned against father or not I want to I don't want to Slumber and I don't want to sleep I want to shake myself tonight and make sure that I'm aware that there's an oncoming storm there's prophecy being fulfilled all around us that I can recognize the day in its message I can recognize the conditions around me I can recognize the amnesia that he spoke of that's setting in father and I can just recognize myself getting just slack and comfortable Lord don't let me miss it it's getting so close help me father rededicate my heart help me flee Into You Lord the only place is safety Lord help me listen to the voice that you've sent to me to guide me father may I not leave off the main thing righteousness the love of God being shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit joining father and holding hands with the brothers and sisters for the cause of Christ okay being concerned about leading people to the Lord talking to the mailman all the things that were spoken in this little time father it would take another four hours to go through all this great statements but Lord you said if he couldn't make it plain in his speaking he asked father that the Holy Spirit would come and make it plain and I trust the holy spirit will make it plain to each of our hearts tonight father I'd like to lift my hand to you and I'd ask you to stir My Heart Lord to shake me don't let me get complacent father let my ear hear the what the messenger was warning us [Music] don't let it slip in undetected Lord may I be so acutely aware of the spiritual condition that he warned us about foreign [Music] father just with this voice of safety that he spoke to us I trust that people understand tonight father I don't know anything better to do than and just to have

and him talk to us don't miss the warning let us go back father and reacquaint ourselves with the warnings that our messenger give us let's go back to the message and say father I've emphasized doctrines I've emphasized blessings I've emphasized predestination I've emphasized the Mysteries father but have I let the warning slip father and kindling me once again that within the framework of
