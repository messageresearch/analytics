[7:36] [Music]
[7:42] you

[8:56] all amen let's pray together our
[8:59] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless us
[9:02] this evening be with us and
[9:06] give us direction our precious father
[9:11] the way that you would have your people
[9:15] to go
[9:16] the scripture says the footsteps of the
[9:19] righteous are ordered by the Lord and
[9:21] father we certainly want our footsteps
[9:24] ordered
[9:25] we want to be willing to take the steps
[9:29] that you would have us to take we ask
[9:32] you to bless us tonight in Jesus
[9:35] precious name we pray
[9:39] bless you it's if you have your Bibles
[9:42] let's turn over into
[9:44] the Book of Joshua and
[9:51] let's read of that as a scripture there
[9:55] when I read this morning 13:1 because I
[10:00] guess it's been three weeks since I've
[10:03] ministered and and so I'm not going to
[10:07] try to go too long I'm going to give a
[10:10] preview of what that I would like to
[10:12] preach on Sunday
[10:15] and
[10:17] you know
[10:20] brother Branham II said that you know a
[10:23] good advertisement
[10:26] draws you in so either it'll be a good
[10:29] advertisement or a bad advertisement so
[10:32] if you don't like the what might come
[10:35] Sunday then I guess we'll have an empty
[10:38] but this is the most people I've
[10:40] preached to and in a while I was
[10:42] referring to that tape or program talked
[10:45] about that road sign you know and he
[10:47] said that road sign he said it really
[10:50] done it he said you don't want to go
[10:52] there and see a big old juicy steak on
[10:55] the picture and when you get there has
[10:58] anybody ever seen a hamburger from
[11:00] McDonald's that looks anything like the
[11:03] picture
[11:05] you know but but so if you think people
[11:09] are really craving something that's real
[11:11] so if you just bear with me this evening
[11:14] and and as we'll just try to do the best
[11:18] we can and fellowship with you around
[11:21] the things of God's Word now Joshua was
[11:25] old and stricken in years and the Lord
[11:29] said unto Joshua thou art old and
[11:34] stricken in years and there remaineth
[11:37] yet very much land to possess Heavenly
[11:42] Father we ask you to bless your word in
[11:44] Jesus name we pray amen amen
[11:47] you may be as a conceited
[11:53] you know I I
[11:57] enjoyed that
[11:59] verse of scripture and I kind of
[12:04] thought about it in a way that you know
[12:09] Joshua may not have realized that he was
[12:12] old and stricken in years you know but
[12:15] the Lord had to remind them that are old
[12:17] and stricken in years and there's still
[12:19] a lot of work to be done and I've always
[12:23] liked the book of Joshua because the
[12:25] book of Joshua as we know is a type of
[12:29] the Holy Spirit and and the book of
[12:32] Ephesians and those those books parallel
[12:36] together and you can see in them a lot
[12:39] of the working of the Lord and how God's
[12:43] does things it's always a blessing to
[12:46] you when you can understand how that God
[12:49] does things and and though why there is
[12:54] important to a believer is because if
[12:58] God ever does one thing one way he'll
[13:01] always continue to do it that way if you
[13:04] ever meet the requirements for a promise
[13:07] of God then that requirement is good
[13:11] every time it's meant you're not in
[13:16] wonderment
[13:17] of what what's going to happen or what's
[13:20] next or how it things changes that way
[13:24] the believer has something that the
[13:27] world doesn't have the world is always
[13:31] changing just then I believe that just
[13:37] in the last few months we've seen a
[13:39] scriptural can you open that for me I
[13:44] could use my teeth but I think that
[13:46] would be a little you take it all the
[13:49] way out for me would you
[13:51] all right thank you I
[13:54] believe we've seen things come to pass
[13:56] right before our eyes but a lot of times
[14:00] we don't know how to take the event and
[14:04] relate the event to the scripture and
[14:08] because naturally we we are people that
[14:14] we make supposition
[14:16] we are interpreters by Nature what we
[14:20] think things are what we think things
[14:23] mean and we had a nice fellowship with
[14:27] the young people and we were talking
[14:29] about truth and truth originated in the
[14:34] beginning okay and so the truth wasn't a
[14:38] consensus that people came up with truth
[14:42] is truth and it stands on its own in
[14:46] other words if we all agreed together in
[14:50] this room that this was an ice cream
[14:53] cone
[14:54] would that make it an ice cream cone no
[14:58] the truth of it is it's a box with
[15:01] tissues in it and that so that doesn't
[15:05] change so the truth could never changes
[15:08] and the truth was established in the
[15:11] beginning in the beginning was the word
[15:13] and the Word was God and the Word was
[15:16] with God and when that word was made
[15:19] flesh Jesus says I am the way the truth
[15:22] the life so truth is something that's
[15:26] unchanging if it's something that we've
[15:29] got to find and line up with the truth
[15:32] we can't change the facts to change the
[15:35] truth that's called a liar
[15:41] one that will assemble the facts to come
[15:45] up with the answer in a conclusion that
[15:50] they want there's kind of a saying in
[15:52] business and that saying is that
[15:57] Liars figure but figures don't lie
[16:03] okay so that's the absoluteness of math
[16:07] and so the thing about the word of god
[16:11] is it's true and it'll come to pass and
[16:15] I thought we miss a lot of times the
[16:18] things of the word coming to pass but I
[16:22] thought of that Scripture okay and we
[16:24] know the scripture that they'll say
[16:26] peace and safety
[16:28] peace and safety and I just got the
[16:32] thinking about what the political
[16:36] climate was and what man was saying we
[16:40] are the most prosperous people than
[16:42] we've ever been this is a greatest we've
[16:46] ever been we're more powerful now in our
[16:48] military is more powerful than we've
[16:51] ever been we're safer now than we've
[16:54] ever been we've got more prosperity now
[16:57] than we ever had unemployment is the
[17:00] lowest it's been
[17:03] okay everything is going great and and
[17:08] people have making more money than their
[17:12] they've ever made and the scripture says
[17:16] that's their gospel peace and safety
[17:19] peace and safety but suddenly
[17:22] destruction comes and in just a matter
[17:25] of time 35 million Americans were out of
[17:30] work
[17:31] restaurants were closed businesses is
[17:35] closed and we haven't even
[17:39] begin to feel
[17:43] the effects of it because our government
[17:47] postponed the effects of it by telling
[17:51] businesses we'll pay the payroll if you
[17:54] don't lay them off but that day is
[17:57] coming
[17:58] do you understand that day is is coming
[18:02] the effects can be postponed but the
[18:06] truth of it cannot be so if the Word of
[18:10] God says they say peace and safety and
[18:13] they say this then sudden destruction
[18:15] comes that we have to realize that the
[18:20] destruction is going to come that
[18:23] there's going to be hardships there's
[18:25] going to be things ahead of us but we
[18:28] can be confident because we have
[18:32] something that doesn't change we have
[18:35] the Word of God and it doesn't change
[18:38] and so we noticed that
[18:42] that
[18:47] the
[18:48] the whole climate of what has transpired
[18:53] and and I thought it was marvelous
[18:56] because just as I looked at the wow this
[19:00] is this is absolutely happening you say
[19:04] am i a divine interpreter of the
[19:06] scripture no I say that the Word of God
[19:08] is interpreted when it comes to pass can
[19:13] one scripture be applied in many
[19:15] circumstances yes because God's an
[19:18] interpreter of his word but I noticed
[19:22] that that the whole country and
[19:26] everybody had went in to a survival mode
[19:31] and
[19:32] and that's all that everybody is trying
[19:35] to do is survive I noticed how that now
[19:41] that they're there wanting
[19:45] and this is what I kind of brought my
[19:48] attention to this that so everybody was
[19:51] locked down everybody went in the
[19:54] shelter everybody put on mass
[19:57] everybody was
[20:01] prepared for an intimate
[20:05] danger and that they were warned and
[20:09] everybody took heed to the warning and
[20:12] everybody went
[20:14] into what we called shelter and we
[20:18] didn't call it shelter we called it
[20:20] fellowshipping in place because it was
[20:22] the time for us to read our Bibles and
[20:25] listen to tapes and put on the music in
[20:28] the home work on the atmosphere and home
[20:30] work on our family skills and
[20:34] how would be nice to one another now
[20:37] that you have to see one another and so
[20:40] those those were things that we called
[20:42] it was a it was a time for us because
[20:45] we're not the people that are ever going
[20:47] to be bound by fear
[20:50] you know I mean we've got it we've got a
[20:52] job that's going to protect this but so
[20:55] everybody went into sheltering and and
[20:59] they they cut into a place of protection
[21:03] and so it first of all it came self
[21:07] protection and then anybody that was out
[21:11] helping sick people or having to help
[21:15] people or having to make contact with
[21:18] the public we called them heroes
[21:22] and up to me they're heroes you know
[21:25] what I mean frontline workers
[21:29] we
[21:31] even put a
[21:34] special
[21:36] acknowledgment to anybody who put
[21:40] themselves at risk and stepped outside
[21:43] of self protection
[21:47] self protection so people are great in
[21:51] the great mode of self protection so
[21:56] their their lives had come into how do I
[22:01] protect myself
[22:02] they bought hand sanitizer they bought
[22:05] gloves they bought masks and and I've
[22:09] looked all over
[22:10] masked to be able to provide masks for
[22:13] anybody who wants a mask I haven't been
[22:16] able to find a mask I even called the
[22:20] Long Ranger and he didn't have any mask
[22:23] though there's there's no masks anywhere
[22:27] you know so
[22:29] but we have a covering amen and that's
[22:34] what we're long but now it seems like
[22:38] there's the desire to get back to work
[22:42] and and this is kind of where my thought
[22:47] is going to go in the next
[22:51] few
[22:54] in the direction that we want to go in
[22:59] and it gets back to work and that what
[23:03] Joshua had told God had told Joshua
[23:08] there's still much land to possess
[23:12] there's still work to do and
[23:17] it doesn't mean that John because Joshua
[23:20] was going to go not as a type but as
[23:25] actually a
[23:28] physical leader that the work stopped
[23:32] and there's there's still work to do
[23:36] and it still is something that that we
[23:42] have got to realize that that the Lord
[23:46] has always had a work for his people to
[23:51] do and
[23:53] sometimes I feel that the enemy and if I
[23:58] was to do a type this virus to me was
[24:02] like a type of the enemy
[24:05] it was the enemy in a form but not only
[24:11] did it attack people physically in a
[24:14] portion of our population that's very
[24:17] dear to all of us and
[24:21] but it also
[24:24] put a mindset
[24:26] into people of a protection mindset and
[24:32] you put that mindset in the lady OC at
[24:36] church age and the spirit of the lady Oh
[24:40] see a church age it it it's a it's a
[24:46] spirit of self-preservation it's a
[24:49] spirit of people's rights and where if
[24:53] the spirit where man puts themselves and
[24:59] their personal well-being above the
[25:03] personal well-being of others and man
[25:06] makes
[25:08] they make associations and and they make
[25:13] affiliations and they make covenants and
[25:16] they make agreements with other people
[25:19] that they feel by entering into this
[25:22] agreement it benefits themselves and so
[25:27] connecting is the the spirit that's on
[25:30] Lady hacia and it's been there since it
[25:33] started it's the spirit of my rights and
[25:37] my
[25:38] preservations and it's what that I
[25:42] have need of and it's it's all about me
[25:45] me what can you do for me you know what
[25:49] I mean at the end and people cater to
[25:53] that and they make promises I'll forgive
[25:57] your debt I will give every American a
[26:01] thousand dollars every American should
[26:04] make so much money a week okay III if
[26:09] you elect me I'll give you that money of
[26:13] free wages
[26:16] well you know that's against the
[26:18] principles of God and the farther you
[26:21] get away from the principles of God the
[26:23] quicker the destruction comes but see
[26:27] everybody wants to affiliate and
[26:30] associate with something that is given
[26:34] to them to benefit them set
[26:38] that human nature
[26:41] okay and so we find that that's the this
[26:45] lady OC an age that we're living in this
[26:49] time that we're living in has come a
[26:52] time where people say I've got to do
[26:57] what's best for me best for my health to
[27:03] best for my circumstance Beth for my
[27:06] situation and very little thought goes
[27:11] into account of how what my effects have
[27:15] on anybody else
[27:18] could know people by nature don't want
[27:22] to know what the well-being of their
[27:24] neighbor is I just know that I don't
[27:28] want my neighbor's trash can on my side
[27:32] of the property line okay and I don't
[27:35] want his dogs putting his nose through
[27:37] my fence and I don't want this and I've
[27:41] got my property and I got my world but
[27:44] very
[27:45] little does it have in people's hearts
[27:48] anymore to really be concerned what can
[27:52] I do for my neighbor
[27:54] well you know what's the other person
[27:57] going through and even though that's one
[28:00] of the great Beatitudes that have been
[28:03] taught us if if somebody needs a coat
[28:06] give them your cloak also if they compel
[28:09] you to go a mile to go
[28:12] a mile also so I want to look at that
[28:16] from the
[28:19] viewpoint of
[28:23] what's been given us and
[28:27] and what approach should we have and
[28:32] it's time for us to get back to work and
[28:37] I want to talk about that and the next
[28:40] service is to come and I like to
[28:48] take this and
[28:50] start with a scripture of found in Luke
[28:57] the twenty-fourth chapter and the 49th
[29:01] verse
[29:17] and it says and behold I send the
[29:22] promise of my father upon you but
[29:29] tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[29:35] ye be endued with power from
[29:40] on high and
[29:43] so if we look at the
[29:47] this great promise that God gave the
[29:54] promise to his disciples that if they
[29:58] would go wait and they with no Terry
[30:01] they would be endued with the power from
[30:05] on high now the definition of
[30:08] in dude means provided with
[30:13] so they would be provided with a power
[30:18] from on high now
[30:21] if you look to the scriptures before
[30:27] that and if you look in the book of Acts
[30:31] to the time before that
[30:35] Jesus told his disciples that I am going
[30:40] to send you into all the world and you
[30:43] are going to be witnesses of the things
[30:46] that you have seen and so they were
[30:52] given a commission they were given
[30:56] instructions
[30:57] that I want you to go out and I want you
[31:02] to do the things that that
[31:06] and be and testify to the themes that I
[31:10] have taught you and so that's the first
[31:14] thing that he's asking these men to do
[31:16] is I have taught you things that are
[31:20] different than the law I have
[31:23] interpreted the law to you because Jesus
[31:26] was a prophet and a prophet is a divine
[31:30] and Turpin of the Word of God and so the
[31:34] Lord Jesus
[31:36] interpreted to them the law what really
[31:40] it was that Moses had written man had
[31:45] taken the law and they had turned it
[31:48] into an organization they had turned it
[31:51] into
[31:52] Sadducees and Pharisees and priesthood
[31:55] and man had put the mark his mark on the
[32:00] law so man had taken the law and
[32:03] interpreted the law to its self benefit
[32:08] life is what man does in every age if it
[32:13] created a hierarchy in the priesthood
[32:16] and it performed all the things that
[32:19] were never intended by the law because
[32:23] man had got a hold of it so you
[32:26] understand what is being said and and so
[32:33] he told the disciples now you are going
[32:36] to go be a witness because there was an
[32:40] exodus taking place
[32:43] there was a leaving of the law
[32:47] moving in to grace
[32:50] so under the law the man by his own
[32:56] strength
[32:57] by his own decisions by his own might
[33:02] had to keep the law and
[33:07] what kept man to help man keep the law
[33:12] was the punishment that went with
[33:16] breaking the law if you're caught in
[33:19] adultery take them and stone them you
[33:22] know there was all kinds if you don't
[33:24] pay your debt you have to put somebody
[33:27] into servitude you know a lot of people
[33:30] put their family into servitude because
[33:33] of their debt and they don't realize it
[33:35] their children go without because they
[33:39] put a lot of credit card debt they don't
[33:42] manage to their funds correctly they
[33:44] spend more than they mate and now they
[33:47] become in bondage to that they they they
[33:50] they without even realizing it their ear
[33:55] gets all and they become bonded and
[33:58] subject to their debt master and the
[34:02] scripture plainly tells us took to do
[34:06] our best - oh no man anything if that's
[34:12] why even when you buy a home they want
[34:15] you to put so much money in it they want
[34:17] you to build some equity in it so if
[34:20] you're not really just upside down and
[34:23] in debt
[34:25] and I'm not preaching about debt today
[34:28] but I just can't help but remind you
[34:31] it's it's a good idea not to get in debt
[34:35] okay it's just is and you can you don't
[34:38] want to become a servant of that debt
[34:42] and so man will buy by the consequence
[34:47] of the law served the law out of his own
[34:50] ability
[34:51] but now there was a Exodus taking place
[34:55] it was moving from the law to another
[35:01] form of leadership and
[35:04] that's what he said when the Spirit of
[35:07] Truth has come when the comforter has
[35:10] come he will lead and guide you in all
[35:13] truth and righteousness so no longer was
[35:16] there a written law that people were
[35:19] under and they had all these priests and
[35:22] scribes and Pharisees interpreting the
[35:26] law and arguing the law and making
[35:29] defense and breaking into little cults
[35:32] and little things like like these things
[35:35] but now there was a promise that
[35:39] there was going to be one that came and
[35:43] that was going to lead us and guide us
[35:47] in all truth and righteousness so there
[35:50] was an exodus
[35:52] that was going to take place from law to
[35:58] grace a change in leadership and so we
[36:04] we realized that that was promised to us
[36:08] and so I'd like just to read a little
[36:11] bit from
[36:13] the Easter seal and as we build here in
[36:17] just closing in a few moments God gave
[36:21] Abraham a promise so God gave them a
[36:25] promise right I'm going to send you the
[36:29] promise that I made with you that you
[36:33] would be endued with power from high you
[36:37] would be provided with a power
[36:41] from on high to carry out the
[36:46] instructions that I have given you
[36:49] that's right people have denominations
[36:54] they have to come up with their own way
[36:57] to follow the instructions but that was
[37:01] never God's intention he was always his
[37:04] intention to have the personal
[37:07] leadership over the believer by his
[37:10] spirit and not they have a
[37:14] group of fellowship that that put
[37:17] pressure on the believer or a group of
[37:20] ministers or ever binding anybody by the
[37:24] fear of consequence but he wanted to
[37:29] provide to them a
[37:33] power I
[37:36] want to hold that
[37:39] provided a power
[37:42] and and so he said now Abraham God gave
[37:48] Abraham a promise and abraham believed
[37:51] God and it was imputed unto him for
[37:56] righteousness
[38:00] but he sealed the Covenant
[38:04] by the seal of circumcision
[38:08] God gives you a prom potentially that
[38:12] that you will receive it and you're
[38:16] going to be raised up this body is going
[38:20] to be glorified with him in the end time
[38:24] so God gives us a promise
[38:28] right and what is our promise that this
[38:32] body will be raised up not this
[38:35] particular
[38:37] fleshly body that of these exact ions
[38:42] and stuff like that because that it has
[38:44] been prophesied to corn in the dust but
[38:48] he blows us and pulls the st. potassium
[38:52] and elements together and it creates for
[38:56] us an incorruptible body that the spirit
[38:59] that we are will will dwell in and so he
[39:03] says but
[39:05] he says but you see
[39:08] he says but you see you have got to get
[39:14] a
[39:15] clearance on that deed and
[39:20] the clearance is when everything against
[39:24] it has been stricken off and
[39:27] you've got the abstract to it you've got
[39:33] the seal it's yours and every string on
[39:37] it belongs to you so God gives you a
[39:42] promise
[39:44] so that's what he told the disciples I
[39:47] give you a commission I give you a
[39:50] promise this promise is the works that I
[39:55] do shall you do also
[39:58] go into all the world preach the gospel
[40:02] and these signs and wonders shall follow
[40:06] them that believe you shall lay hands on
[40:09] the sick and they shall recover you
[40:12] shall take up deadly thing and it will
[40:14] not hurt you you shall lay your hands on
[40:17] the sick he shall speak and you'll cast
[40:20] out devils these things that's the
[40:23] promise
[40:24] so in promised form you potentially have
[40:29] that
[40:30] but now God wants to give you something
[40:33] that
[40:36] can prove to you that
[40:40] you are the possessor of
[40:44] that promise that you're not just making
[40:49] cling to it this is my property
[40:54] well I know her brother that a man told
[40:58] them that this property was his and he
[41:01] said I'd like to sell it to you so you
[41:04] can build a church on it and I want to
[41:07] give you a good deal and the brother
[41:12] should thank you brother that's
[41:13] wonderful how much do you want he said
[41:16] oh how about
[41:19] $100,000 oh
[41:21] that's marvelous
[41:23] gives him $100,000
[41:27] one day he's standing out in the
[41:29] property praising the Lord for the
[41:33] property and what a great thing that God
[41:35] had done for him and a man showed up
[41:40] he says what are you doing oh
[41:43] he says I'm acting just like you know
[41:48] the scripture said every place that I
[41:51] put my foot is my possession and I'm
[41:56] walking on it and I'm claiming it and
[41:58] I'm praising God for every thing of it
[42:01] and and the man looked at me says well
[42:04] you've just taken your last step you get
[42:07] off this property else I'm calling the
[42:08] police
[42:13] wait a minute faith was there
[42:17] he believed the brother
[42:22] yeah
[42:24] the land was there
[42:27] but what was missing
[42:31] the abstract deed was missing
[42:35] he sold them something that didn't
[42:38] belong to him
[42:42] nope you understand that exactly what's
[42:47] happened with denominations and
[42:49] organizations and systems they sold the
[42:52] people something that doesn't belong to
[42:55] them
[42:58] it's not theirs
[43:02] so you can and and they so they try to
[43:07] claim the promises
[43:11] but they don't have the abstract that
[43:14] proves that they're the possessor of
[43:18] the promise
[43:22] Abraham had a sign in his flesh because
[43:25] he received this fleshly promise
[43:29] we should have a spiritual sign in our
[43:32] spirit because we've received a
[43:35] spiritual promise so that God gives the
[43:41] disciples something
[43:44] to prove to them that
[43:48] the promise that he had given them and
[43:52] the commission that he had given them
[43:56] that they now were the possessors of it
[43:59] I go to closings if I buy a property and
[44:03] I sit down at the closing or if I sell
[44:06] something and I you fill out a bunch of
[44:09] paperwork's about as thick as this book
[44:12] and you sign this and you sign that and
[44:16] you sign this and you sign you're not a
[44:18] terrorist and you can you sign all these
[44:22] things and and everything when it's all
[44:25] said and done they've covered every base
[44:28] they've made sure there's nothing no
[44:32] charge laid against it
[44:37] and they finally give you a deed
[44:41] that says this property has been passed
[44:45] on to this property and if we bear
[44:47] witness for it and and it's true and
[44:51] that gets filed at the courthouse now do
[44:53] you have something that you've received
[44:57] that proves that you are the owner and
[45:01] the possessor
[45:04] you just don't say I'm a possessor
[45:08] that is not faith
[45:16] every promise in the book does mine
[45:18] every chapter every verse every line
[45:23] you don't have to prove that
[45:27] he is the one that proves that's true
[45:33] if I sell the property I've got to prove
[45:37] that I am capable
[45:42] of
[45:45] transferring this property to you that I
[45:50] have the power I have the right I have
[45:54] the authority I have the ability I have
[45:57] to prove that I can make this promise
[46:03] if not it's a sham in that corrected
[46:08] denominational world that religious
[46:11] dogmas and creeds and everything is a
[46:13] sham
[46:15] because they can't prove that they've
[46:19] got the authority to make the claim
[46:24] that's why this message is so
[46:27] beautifully vindicated because the man
[46:30] that spoke the word was vindicated to
[46:33] show that he had the power to make the
[46:36] claim to
[46:38] be the divine interpreter of the word
[46:47] he says now let somebody try to put you
[46:50] off a land and say it doesn't belong to
[46:53] you with the abstract in your hand
[47:01] right
[47:02] you won't be able to do it
[47:05] when we believe on Jesus Christ for our
[47:08] savior
[47:09] repent and are baptized and
[47:14] come up to believe him God recognizes
[47:18] our repentance and
[47:21] our faith towards him and
[47:25] sends down the
[47:28] abstract
[47:31] the abstract is the assurance
[47:37] it's a guarantee that everything that
[47:41] was ever held against you and
[47:45] you thoroughly repented hallelujah the
[47:50] property is bought and you hold the
[47:53] abstract for that assurance so you
[47:58] repent you
[48:01] confess your sins
[48:03] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[48:06] Jesus Christ you've done everything now
[48:09] he's going to give you something
[48:14] he's going to
[48:17] do you
[48:20] or / buy to you
[48:24] something that answers and settles the
[48:29] questions I have been forgiven
[48:34] every promise in this book is mine
[48:38] because he sins down the Holy Spirit and
[48:44] seals the believer and
[48:47] baptizes the believer and gives them the
[48:50] possession of every promise in the book
[48:58] no longer is it saying I see the promise
[49:02] I
[49:03] know the promise is there
[49:08] but now this baptism this
[49:14] Stratton that is sent down I will not
[49:16] leave you comfortless
[49:21] comfortless is when you're in doubt
[49:23] comfortless is when you're caught in the
[49:25] middle coverless is when your hope
[49:27] between two opinions
[49:31] but if you could have something that
[49:33] settles the question I
[49:36] know I'm saved I know I'm secure I know
[49:42] I'm going to be resurrected I
[49:47] know it why because
[49:51] he sent down
[49:54] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[50:00] he personally came and sealed me he
[50:06] personally came to me and
[50:13] provided me with
[50:16] a power
[50:21] he provided it have you ever went to a
[50:25] place and they said I'll provide the hot
[50:28] dogs and the hamburgers
[50:30] and you get there and there they are
[50:34] it's the proof of the promise I
[50:40] don't mean to make it so carnal but I
[50:43] want I want you to pick up on this is
[50:46] that if he makes a promise he
[50:50] has to give you an assurance he has to
[50:54] give you something that proves that
[50:57] every promise in your this book is yours
[50:59] and it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[51:04] it's not any motion not a sensation it's
[51:07] a provided
[51:09] assurance
[51:10] from him to you personally that every
[51:15] promise in the book is yours
[51:21] that gives the comfort
[51:25] that's there
[51:27] it's been in dude it's been provided go
[51:32] wait go tarry until you're provided with
[51:36] a power from on high
[51:40] that is cash read on if we're just
[51:43] laying some foundation to where we want
[51:46] to go
[51:47] let somebody try to put you off a land
[51:52] that doesn't belong to you
[51:55] tried to put you off a land and say it
[51:59] doesn't belong to you with the abstract
[52:03] in your hand
[52:05] so God gives you something that Satan
[52:10] can't come along every time and push you
[52:13] off the promise
[52:18] push you off your salvation
[52:22] get your eyes you know con on somebody
[52:26] else
[52:27] and never can you imagine me having the
[52:30] abstract in my hand and some little
[52:35] tweedily wishy-washy naysayer backbiter
[52:40] criticism come guy comes along it's just
[52:44] that long don't belong to you it
[52:47] belongs to him
[52:51] he's the guy
[52:53] that bought it he's the guy everybody in
[52:58] this town knows he's the real owner
[53:02] and you fall for that
[53:05] know
[53:08] you've got the abstract
[53:11] so what would you do with that abstract
[53:14] if you had do you take it to the highest
[53:16] court in the land and the Supreme Court
[53:20] would rule and they say this man it's
[53:24] got the abstract I don't care what
[53:28] the gossip is I don't care what the
[53:32] tradition is I don't care what the
[53:35] people thought he
[53:37] possesses that it's is well you got
[53:41] attention to this supreme throne of the
[53:44] Lord Jesus Christ and lay that abstract
[53:48] down performance a you gave me this
[53:51] abstract
[53:55] you're the one that gave me the
[53:57] assurance you're the one that said my
[54:01] sins were forgiven you are the one that
[54:04] said every promise isn't the book is
[54:06] mine and you gave me
[54:10] this
[54:11] baptism of the Spirit as a proof I
[54:17] know I possess this baptism so I know I
[54:22] possess
[54:23] everything that comes with it oh
[54:29] it's settled
[54:33] but it's not settled if you don't trust
[54:36] your abstract
[54:43] you know what will happen you'll never
[54:46] build on it
[54:51] you'll live in fear
[54:54] you'll never go forward
[54:57] you'll never do any works
[55:00] you will never carry out the Commission
[55:04] you'll never go forward with the promise
[55:09] because you're not sure
[55:12] it'll work
[55:16] I'm not sure
[55:19] I'm afraid man if I believe with all my
[55:22] heart
[55:23] it might not happen
[55:33] no law on the land can do it because you
[55:36] hold the abstract and there's no devil
[55:41] no church or any theology that can
[55:46] overstep the boundaries of God's proof
[55:50] and abstract that the baptism of the
[55:54] holy spirit has recognized us in Christ
[55:58] Jesus
[55:59] hallelujah
[56:03] can you imagine having the baptism of
[56:07] the Holy Spirit in your life and not
[56:10] realizing what it is that you possess
[56:18] he didn't say I'll send you to the upper
[56:21] room and you shall see a feeling
[56:24] no he said you shall be provided with a
[56:29] power
[56:31] that will allow you to carry out the
[56:36] Commission and do the work it wasn't
[56:40] them doing the work we call it the Acts
[56:42] of the Apostles
[56:44] but the prophet of God tools it was the
[56:47] acts of the Holy Spirit in the Apostles
[56:52] in other words it was the Acts of the
[56:56] abstract
[56:58] provision that God made to perform the
[57:03] promise
[57:04] hallelujah
[57:07] every act of the Apostles was the proof
[57:12] that the abstract had been given
[57:16] that their sins were forgiven they were
[57:19] chosen they were recognized identified
[57:23] and commissioned to do the work to
[57:29] do the work
[57:32] to get back to work
[57:35] they're commissioned to do the work
[57:39] Peter goes up there
[57:42] and he Selva says sam'l silver and gold
[57:46] have I none
[57:48] but I've got something
[57:51] it's an abstract
[57:54] it's a power that has been provided to
[57:58] me by the Holy Spirit
[58:02] God gave me this power I don't have this
[58:07] power in my son mighty Sal I
[58:11] was a sinner
[58:14] but he forgave my sins I
[58:18] was a coward
[58:22] but he changed that nature and made me
[58:27] bold
[58:30] something happened
[58:33] so silver and gold I have none but I
[58:38] have the abstract I
[58:41] have the power
[58:44] that I receive from him
[58:48] that has been provided to me
[58:53] to do the work
[58:58] rise up
[59:00] and walk
[59:01] in the name of Jesus Christ
[59:07] that was the abstract in action it was
[59:14] possession
[59:16] put to use
[59:18] that's where I'm headed Sunday
[59:27] the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a
[59:30] possession
[59:31] the abstract is a possession it is a
[59:36] power you possess the power is in the
[59:42] abstract
[59:44] the powers not in the claim
[59:50] without the abstract that claim is a
[59:54] deceit
[1:00:00] so what do you think the first thing
[1:00:02] that that good man should have done he
[1:00:04] says show me the deed show me the
[1:00:07] abstract show me that you possess it he
[1:00:11] didn't take it onward only
[1:00:15] Paul said I didn't come to you
[1:00:19] with enticing words I
[1:00:23] came to you with the power and
[1:00:26] demonstration of the Holy Spirit I came
[1:00:30] to you possessing the abstract that was
[1:00:34] given by God to every believer that
[1:00:40] I've recognized and accepted that
[1:00:44] believes my word
[1:00:50] since when that we got to the place that
[1:00:53] we just accept enticing words
[1:01:00] that we we accept fine orientation and
[1:01:05] great explanations when have we got to
[1:01:09] the place that we start patting one
[1:01:11] another on the back I'm okay you're okay
[1:01:14] let's all agree we're okay
[1:01:17] that's a relief that it's our way
[1:01:21] like I said we should change the name to
[1:01:24] the church till we're right everybody
[1:01:26] else is wrong Tabernacle I
[1:01:30] don't care where you go I
[1:01:34] don't care if you're in a Baptist Church
[1:01:36] the Methodist Church Pest fruitarian
[1:01:39] Church if you have the abstract you have
[1:01:42] the promise
[1:01:46] and these works you shall do
[1:01:51] because I go to the Father and if I go
[1:01:55] to the Father I will not leave you nor
[1:01:58] forsake you but high personal pronoun
[1:02:01] will come again and I will send you the
[1:02:06] abstract the comforter the proof
[1:02:11] the abstracts the proof the powers in
[1:02:16] the proof is not in you
[1:02:19] it's not in your claim it's what you
[1:02:23] possess
[1:02:25] it's what's been given to you
[1:02:30] the Word of God says lay your hands on
[1:02:33] the sick and they shall recover
[1:02:36] people laid their hands on the sick all
[1:02:38] the time and people don't recover
[1:02:41] but you let a person that got the
[1:02:44] abstract
[1:02:47] who's got the Commission who's been
[1:02:50] given the power to
[1:02:53] fulfill the promise that
[1:02:58] person
[1:03:00] when that person prays
[1:03:03] it produces results I
[1:03:08] hope that I
[1:03:11] want to encourage us
[1:03:14] because I ask the question what are we
[1:03:17] building
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:20] they're good questions where are we
[1:03:23] going what now
[1:03:26] what do we do now you know we're doing
[1:03:29] we're going fishing
[1:03:32] now we need them to come walk in and say
[1:03:35] cast the net in other words get back to
[1:03:39] work
[1:03:43] get back doing what you're you're you
[1:03:47] did come back and so good let us read on
[1:03:51] him will close up
[1:03:57] he says
[1:03:58] and we have assurance to raise that he
[1:04:05] raised because
[1:04:07] potentially we have already raised in
[1:04:11] him
[1:04:13] do you understand this abstract
[1:04:16] everything does
[1:04:18] it's the seal of our resurrection it's
[1:04:22] the proof
[1:04:23] why try to claim
[1:04:26] that you're going to raise from the dead
[1:04:30] on an intellectual
[1:04:33] theology
[1:04:35] on a on a church doctrine on the church
[1:04:41] fellowship on an association of who you
[1:04:45] know when he is willing to give you the
[1:04:50] resurrection life in advance
[1:04:56] if the same spirit that dwelt in him
[1:05:00] dwell in you it will also quicken your
[1:05:04] mortal body so when he gives you his
[1:05:07] spirit he gives you resurrection
[1:05:11] to I said were possessors of
[1:05:14] the resurrection we have the abstract
[1:05:17] that
[1:05:19] we will raise with him because he's
[1:05:23] already showed
[1:05:25] that we've died with him and we've
[1:05:29] repented and we've passed from death
[1:05:31] unto life now he gives us something oh
[1:05:36] thank you lord he and dude Dow's you
[1:05:39] with power from high he provides you
[1:05:42] with a power
[1:05:46] not just an anointing
[1:05:50] but a possession not something that
[1:05:53] comes and goes now your possession can
[1:05:57] get stimulated
[1:06:00] and
[1:06:01] brought to your remembrance and you go
[1:06:04] to shouting praising God and we call
[1:06:06] that the anointing and that's what an
[1:06:10] annoying is if the stimulation
[1:06:12] but that stimulation can follow on
[1:06:16] people that don't possess the abstract
[1:06:19] they don't possess the proof
[1:06:23] of course you know where my questions
[1:06:25] going don't you
[1:06:27] you've got to know you've got the proof
[1:06:32] okay then just just finish I know I'm
[1:06:36] trying to finish
[1:06:37] the whole thing what does it do to our
[1:06:41] mortal body it turns our opinion and
[1:06:47] changes our notions
[1:06:55] what I
[1:06:57] know a lot of people that
[1:07:00] they need that abstract that change some
[1:07:04] opinions and some notions I like that
[1:07:07] song it'll make you love everybody you
[1:07:10] don't make you love your brother
[1:07:12] you know what I mean it's a sad day that
[1:07:16] you looked upon human flesh and
[1:07:19] judge it
[1:07:21] every time you look upon a man you're
[1:07:25] going to find fault
[1:07:29] our righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:07:34] there's none of us righteous but him
[1:07:38] could act like he provides the
[1:07:41] righteousness
[1:07:45] I'll give you the power I'll provide the
[1:07:48] righteousness
[1:07:50] he's our righteousness not us I possess
[1:07:55] it I don't know how you got it brother
[1:07:58] McGarry brother McGarry don't know how
[1:08:01] he got it either
[1:08:05] because he surely didn't earn it
[1:08:08] he surely didn't do anything for it
[1:08:13] the only thing I know is when I heard
[1:08:17] there was something here that said amen
[1:08:21] and then when he said if you believe I
[1:08:25] will give you a power from on high
[1:08:30] I said Lord I want that
[1:08:33] have I been worrying it against the
[1:08:35] flesh the flesh wars against the spirit
[1:08:38] and these two things are contrary one to
[1:08:41] another
[1:08:42] it's a constant battle but how do I know
[1:08:47] I'm not losing the battle I
[1:08:56] possess the abstract
[1:09:01] I'll not leave you nor forsake you but
[1:09:05] I'll be with you what is that abstract
[1:09:08] do it convicts me of sin
[1:09:13] it instructs me in righteousness the way
[1:09:16] to go
[1:09:18] it makes life miserable for me when I
[1:09:21] get out of the way
[1:09:23] but it don't quit
[1:09:28] like that song everything except he
[1:09:31] never stops he never stops I think it's
[1:09:34] working right or never stops never they
[1:09:36] just go on how he never stops and
[1:09:37] they're all jumping down till the point
[1:09:39] you're saying stop already
[1:09:43] but you don't you see
[1:09:46] it don't matter how do I know because
[1:09:50] the flesh is contrary to the spirit but
[1:09:53] the spirits contrary to the flesh also
[1:09:57] so I've got
[1:09:59] representation
[1:10:02] in the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:06] I've got representation that I've
[1:10:09] received the promise I've got
[1:10:12] representation so when he tries to kick
[1:10:15] me off of the land of my promise that
[1:10:19] God gave me I take the abstract
[1:10:25] I'll hold it up
[1:10:28] did he give it to me
[1:10:31] he says you don't deserve it that may be
[1:10:34] true but I've got it
[1:10:37] and you can't have it
[1:10:44] how it is now we can go toe-to-toe Satan
[1:10:49] but my Bible tells me if you resist them
[1:10:53] he'll flee
[1:10:56] amen we saw that this morning and
[1:10:59] brother Abraham's testimony
[1:11:03] it changes our opinion our notions it
[1:11:08] sets our affections on things which are
[1:11:11] above and the smoking drinking gambling
[1:11:15] the things that you used to do is dead
[1:11:21] it's beneath you and
[1:11:24] you are quickened
[1:11:27] in this quickening power and it brings
[1:11:32] your body unto a rapturing condition
[1:11:37] already whoo whoo
[1:11:42] the rapture means a lot to me I don't
[1:11:46] see nothing for this country that's
[1:11:49] going to do it any good but the bride
[1:11:51] leaving it
[1:11:53] and then it can be put out of its misery
[1:11:59] because you're the only things holding
[1:12:02] it together why
[1:12:15] so what's the quickening power it's the
[1:12:19] power that was provided to you
[1:12:24] to perform
[1:12:25] the commission
[1:12:32] notice the Pentecostal people up there
[1:12:35] when they got quickened by the Holy
[1:12:38] Spirit listen to me that's mother
[1:12:42] Brennan
[1:12:45] listen to me when that Pentecostal group
[1:12:50] up there on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:53] received their abstract deed from God
[1:12:57] the baptism of the Holy Spirit the power
[1:13:02] that he promised to ndu him with
[1:13:05] sure it glorified their soul
[1:13:09] they screamed and they saw tongues of
[1:13:15] fire separate upon each of them and it
[1:13:20] also quicken their bodies till they
[1:13:23] couldn't even speak an earthly language
[1:13:26] anymore it quicken their bodies to a
[1:13:29] heavenly language
[1:13:31] the place they were going to be
[1:13:37] quickening power of God shook their
[1:13:40] mortal bodies so until they're entitled
[1:13:43] mortal language was transfigured and
[1:13:46] transformed into an immortal language
[1:13:50] what a quickening power what something
[1:13:54] it belongs if the Holy Spirit that
[1:13:58] raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in
[1:14:02] your mortal bodies it shall quicken your
[1:14:06] mortal body
[1:14:10] we are quickened then by the power of
[1:14:16] the Living God
[1:14:19] so anybody in this building tonight that
[1:14:23] would confess to me that you have the
[1:14:27] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:29] you are a possessor of a power
[1:14:35] they're inseparable
[1:14:45] you get the land you get it the land
[1:14:56] now watch it
[1:14:59] what's he talking about the abstract
[1:15:01] this power I want when you think
[1:15:04] quickening power when you think abstract
[1:15:07] that's all terminologies for the baptism
[1:15:10] of the Holy Spirit what was the baptism
[1:15:13] of the holy spirit it was the power that
[1:15:17] God sent down to the believer to perform
[1:15:21] and possess the promise it's not a third
[1:15:26] person it's not in an emotional
[1:15:29] experience it's not a sensation it's a
[1:15:33] literal
[1:15:37] transference of
[1:15:39] his power
[1:15:42] to his church
[1:15:45] it's the passing off of power and
[1:15:50] authority
[1:15:53] see we've taught it as a I don't know
[1:15:56] what we taught it has but I'm just
[1:15:59] telling you how the Prophet taught it
[1:16:01] and
[1:16:02] believe me that's good enough for me
[1:16:07] now watch it it was also designed to
[1:16:10] give them after this abstract baptism
[1:16:14] the Holy Ghost quickening power it was
[1:16:17] designed to give them every promise that
[1:16:21] was on the grounds every promise that
[1:16:26] was on the grounds of God's Word
[1:16:31] in other words it just didn't give you
[1:16:34] the power it also gave you every promise
[1:16:43] every promise
[1:16:45] when you got that abstract you got every
[1:16:48] promise
[1:16:51] when you got the abstract you got the
[1:16:55] baptism of the Holy Spirit you received
[1:16:58] that big-name power not only did you get
[1:17:00] every promise but you got the power to
[1:17:03] possess and perform
[1:17:06] every promise
[1:17:09] because if he didn't what good would it
[1:17:12] be
[1:17:13] be worthless
[1:17:16] like someone to give you a dollar bill
[1:17:18] and the other side's not printed on it
[1:17:22] you can't cash it in
[1:17:28] just think how lucky you are
[1:17:30] excuse that word that's a terrible word
[1:17:32] forgive me for saying that
[1:17:34] edit the tape
[1:17:43] God's Word that was promised in the
[1:17:45] Bible that quickening power was given to
[1:17:49] them to quicken that promise to them
[1:17:55] so it's given to make the promises real
[1:17:59] to you
[1:18:02] therefore they laid hands on
[1:18:05] the sick and they were healed they spoke
[1:18:10] in new tongues they did great signs and
[1:18:14] wonders because that was in God's
[1:18:19] promise
[1:18:22] so when they received it they received
[1:18:25] the promise when they received it they
[1:18:28] received the quickening power to perform
[1:18:32] those promises so that's why they did it
[1:18:35] and when Jesus died to redeem us back to
[1:18:39] them that ground that belonged to the
[1:18:43] sons and daughters of God he
[1:18:46] demonstrated what God was and how dare
[1:18:50] we socialize that and put it into an
[1:18:55] organization we have no right to do that
[1:19:02] when he died he died to return that
[1:19:07] power
[1:19:08] to his sons and daughters and we have no
[1:19:13] right to socialize that oh
[1:19:18] this message may not be a denomination
[1:19:21] but it's certainly becoming a social
[1:19:24] event
[1:19:30] but that's not our evidence I know that
[1:19:33] they love us
[1:19:34] like
[1:19:36] they'll know us by our love one for
[1:19:39] another
[1:19:40] and that's good and I think one of the
[1:19:44] great compliments that our congregation
[1:19:49] gets from all around people come and
[1:19:53] said I feel the love I feel that people
[1:19:56] love one another
[1:19:58] look I want to add the next step to that
[1:20:01] I
[1:20:05] want to add the possession of the
[1:20:08] abstract
[1:20:17] now listen close
[1:20:19] as we close this evening
[1:20:28] the Holy Spirit today is
[1:20:32] hunting out
[1:20:33] honest hearts
[1:20:36] that will believe that message
[1:20:43] that message is the message that told
[1:20:47] the church the power that was provided
[1:20:52] to the disciples has been
[1:20:55] restored
[1:20:59] you believe that there's a restoration
[1:21:03] mesi
[1:21:05] the faith that
[1:21:08] was once
[1:21:11] provided to the Saints
[1:21:17] week we take the word the faith that
[1:21:20] they once had no it was the faith that
[1:21:23] was provided to them when was it
[1:21:27] provided it was provided when the Holy
[1:21:30] Spirit came
[1:21:32] when the abstract came when the
[1:21:35] quickening power came that was provided
[1:21:38] to them that's what quickened the
[1:21:41] promises to them that's what made them
[1:21:43] believe in the promises no wonder he
[1:21:46] said without the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:48] Ghost you shall not see
[1:21:51] the kingdom of God
[1:21:56] that's why the formula is repent
[1:21:59] the Word of God brings you under
[1:22:02] conviction
[1:22:03] repent be baptized in the name of the
[1:22:09] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:22:12] your sins and you
[1:22:13] shall be provided a power from on high
[1:22:19] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:22:23] thank you Lord Jesus a power an
[1:22:28] assurance a seal
[1:22:32] something that God's going to give me to
[1:22:35] do the works that I've been called to do
[1:22:39] for you are his workmanship in Christ
[1:22:43] Jesus for ordained unto good works that
[1:22:48] you should walk in them I
[1:22:52] can't
[1:22:54] I'm carnal I have a carnal mind
[1:23:00] the Lord says I'll fix that
[1:23:03] I'll send down a power and
[1:23:06] the power is going to change your
[1:23:09] opinion it's going to change your
[1:23:11] notions it's going to change your mind
[1:23:14] it'll put the same mind in you that was
[1:23:17] in Christ Jesus where you no longer look
[1:23:20] after your own but you look after the
[1:23:22] things of others hallelujah
[1:23:29] that will believe that message
[1:23:32] the message of this gospel is I died for
[1:23:36] your sins I will come again I will send
[1:23:39] you a power I will dwell in you I'll be
[1:23:42] with you even in you and the works that
[1:23:45] I do you shall do all the Holy Spirit is
[1:23:49] looking
[1:23:50] for young men young women everywhere
[1:23:55] that will believe that
[1:24:00] everything in the Bible that was
[1:24:03] promised is to that believer
[1:24:07] and when you accept it in its fullness
[1:24:12] then God knows
[1:24:14] that you'll do it
[1:24:20] when you accept it he knows that you
[1:24:24] will do it I
[1:24:28] love that he gives you the abstract to
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:37] when he knows you believe it he knows
[1:24:40] you will do it he gives you the power to
[1:24:43] perform I
[1:24:49] wonder if he stopped with the power
[1:24:54] somebody told us the power is good
[1:24:56] enough
[1:24:57] the power in itself is nothing
[1:25:04] he said that if they'd have all the
[1:25:07] mechanics
[1:25:09] but till it gets that something that
[1:25:11] ignites that spark it don't move
[1:25:17] it gives you the abstract of that then
[1:25:21] every promise that's made is in your
[1:25:26] possession
[1:25:30] when you got it then every promise that
[1:25:33] was made is
[1:25:36] in your possession and the Holy Spirit
[1:25:40] has to quicken that to you oh my what
[1:25:47] kind of people should we be how
[1:25:50] wonderful to see God's great Holy Spirit
[1:25:55] here to do that power think of it the
[1:26:01] Holy Ghost itself is here to be bear
[1:26:05] record of this our jesus said so that's
[1:26:09] the same yesterday today and forever how
[1:26:12] dare any man to wipe that out of there
[1:26:17] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:26:21] these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:25] believe that is the assurance
[1:26:33] men I never meant to people that's
[1:26:35] possessed with insurance I
[1:26:39] bought something and by the time they
[1:26:41] wanted to sell me all the protection
[1:26:43] plans I figured they were selling me a
[1:26:45] piece of junk
[1:26:50] they won't even guarantee it that's
[1:26:53] insurance
[1:26:55] insurance is a guarantee there's only
[1:26:58] one pterence that God provides mankind
[1:27:01] and that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:08] individual not group
[1:27:14] when we see a group of people sitting
[1:27:19] together and those signs manifesting
[1:27:22] themselves
[1:27:23] that's the assurance that the abstract
[1:27:27] is
[1:27:28] there to vindicate that that's the
[1:27:33] property of
[1:27:35] God
[1:27:41] not our say-so
[1:27:45] when the Holy Spirit is there and that
[1:27:49] abstract is there performing the
[1:27:54] promises of God that's the assurance
[1:27:57] that that's God's people and that and
[1:28:02] that's the property of
[1:28:06] God
[1:28:09] one man claimed it was his property
[1:28:13] and he sold it
[1:28:17] and
[1:28:19] that man claimed it was his property and
[1:28:23] he would have sold it
[1:28:26] but somebody showed up I
[1:28:31] don't want to be a church without an
[1:28:33] abstract I
[1:28:37] want to be intellectuals
[1:28:41] if you possess the
[1:28:47] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:50] then by confession
[1:28:53] you possess the power and I'd like to
[1:28:58] read this scripture to you
[1:29:01] found in
[1:29:04] Joshua if you would turn back with me
[1:29:09] to the book of Joshua
[1:29:14] and Billy Billy if you would come please
[1:29:19] thank you for bearing with me
[1:29:31] and I could type this out into so many
[1:29:34] beautiful ways but the 18th
[1:29:37] verse chapter of Joshua Joshua 18 1
[1:29:43] and the whole congregation of the
[1:29:47] children of Israel assembled together at
[1:29:50] Shiloh and
[1:29:53] set up the tabernacle of the
[1:29:55] congregation there and the land was
[1:29:59] fitted before them and there remaineth
[1:30:03] among the children of Israel seven
[1:30:07] tribes
[1:30:09] almost like seven church changes huh
[1:30:13] which had not yet received their
[1:30:17] inheritance
[1:30:23] and Joshua said
[1:30:26] undo the children of Israel
[1:30:29] and this what I'm saying us tonight
[1:30:33] how long
[1:30:36] are ye
[1:30:39] slack
[1:30:41] to go possess the land which
[1:30:45] the Lord God of your father's
[1:30:49] have given me
[1:30:52] how long are we going to slack
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:02] these are the questions that I'd like to
[1:31:06] maybe ask Sunday and start going forward
[1:31:11] with the 10 question in Joshua how are
[1:31:15] we going to slap
[1:31:16] when do we call upon the power in doubt
[1:31:21] given to us
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:26] given to us from him
[1:31:30] from heaven
[1:31:34] when do we start using that power
[1:31:39] are we sure the evidence that we have
[1:31:43] this power
[1:31:44] do we know what it is
[1:31:48] and what it can do
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:32:00] how many in here in claim they had the
[1:32:03] Holy Ghost
[1:32:06] you have power to say to this mountain
[1:32:10] be moved
[1:32:16] and remember that if it's a promise
[1:32:21] the power is given
[1:32:24] to perform the promise
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:30] if I go forward I want to go forward
[1:32:35] with the abstract with the quickening
[1:32:38] power with the baptism the Holy Spirit
[1:32:41] you know if I have it I want to use it
[1:32:44] how long are you going to slap
[1:32:49] and

[1:33:26] one went and
[1:33:29] used it then one buried it

[1:33:39] of the Holy Spirit

[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:58] I
[1:44:59] knew the minute you glad it's meta power
[1:45:03] available him an it's not all power it's
[1:45:06] East power and then he's made it
[1:45:09] available to all that believe that we
[1:45:10] can come and receive of it Amen that
[1:45:13] will so we can do his works Amen but it
[1:45:15] Tim style if he could just come in this
[1:45:17] business tonight
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:29] couldn't help but think this morning
[1:45:31] when brother Billy was preaching about
[1:45:33] Lazarus
[1:45:35] and
[1:45:37] how Jesus wept and that's the scripture
[1:45:41] it's a shortest verse in the Bible st.
[1:45:44] John 11:35 but how that was the basis of
[1:45:48] the claim this woman had what she came
[1:45:52] to brother Branham and said that brother
[1:45:55] Branham put too much on Jesus Christ
[1:45:58] that he wasn't divine and he said she
[1:46:02] said he could she could prove it to him
[1:46:04] he said how is that and took him to that
[1:46:07] scripture and said jesus wept he was a
[1:46:10] man
[1:46:11] and he said truly he was just a man
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] but when he laid his shoulders back and
[1:46:20] called Lazarus forth from the grave he
[1:46:22] said that was more than a man that was
[1:46:24] scar
[1:46:26] and what brother David brought us
[1:46:28] tonight is that abstract power
[1:46:31] it comes down even
[1:46:34] we as mortals take up on a heavenly beam
[1:46:38] and we're we're more than men and when a
[1:46:42] man so let's bow our heads
[1:46:45] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:46:47] Lord for
[1:46:48] the many things Lord that you've done
[1:46:51] for us the examples you've sent before
[1:46:52] us and given the Lord is nothing like
[1:46:56] the Living Word or did we have access to
[1:47:00] and Lord you continue to to bring us to
[1:47:03] higher heights and deeper depths of
[1:47:05] revelation and understanding morning
[1:47:07] realizing that it's nothing that we've
[1:47:10] done that the calling of God in our
[1:47:13] lives Lord
[1:47:14] so Lord we pray that we can yield to the
[1:47:17] spirit Lord that it wants to move up a
[1:47:20] little higher and Lord may our flesh not
[1:47:23] hold it but Lord may we just continue to
[1:47:25] to soar in the heavenlies Lord
[1:47:27] spiritually speaking that
[1:47:30] the Lord we recognize the truth we see a
[1:47:32] man to it so let it be done and the
[1:47:36] manifestation comes forth
[1:47:38] so Lord we pray that we would be held
[1:47:42] back from any
[1:47:43] any inhibitions or thoughts of our own
[1:47:46] Lord is there's nothing in this flesh
[1:47:49] it's gonna do it anyway the Lord may we
[1:47:51] yield to your presence go with us this
[1:47:54] day Lord and thank you for the beautiful
[1:47:57] weather at the time we've had Lord and
[1:47:59] the comfort of the Holy Spirit or may we
[1:48:03] enjoy the blessings and the access to
[1:48:06] all the the power the abstract gives us
