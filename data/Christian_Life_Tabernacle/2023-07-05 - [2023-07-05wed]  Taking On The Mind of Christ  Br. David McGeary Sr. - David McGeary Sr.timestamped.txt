[32:09] amen you know you can't you can't
[32:14] there's nothing that substitutes for a
[32:17] personal relationship with the Lord
[32:19] Jesus
[32:20] you know to know that he loves you oh if
[32:24] we could just know that
[32:26] you know that he loves us above all
[32:28] things let's approach him our gracious
[32:31] father
[32:32] your love is so great father that well
[32:36] we were yet sinners
[32:38] you died for us and you loved us
[32:43] father you even gave yourself
[32:46] for the whole world
[32:51] even though you knew many wouldn't
[32:52] believe on you and that they would
[32:55] turn from you but
[32:58] yet because it was who that you were
[33:02] that the love of God was shed abroad in
[33:05] your heart and
[33:07] Lord and our desire is that
[33:12] we put on that nature
[33:16] that we have that spirit in US
[33:20] for there's a promise in the scripture
[33:22] that saidth the same spirit that dwelt
[33:25] and Jesus Christ
[33:27] dwells in our mortal body The Same
[33:30] Spirit that quickened him it would also
[33:34] Quicken us
[33:36] father and that's what we're here for
[33:38] we're living for father we're living for
[33:42] your soon appearing
[33:44] father and there's no substitute in the
[33:47] world and what would a man give in
[33:49] exchange for his soul father we just
[33:53] asked that you'd put a steadfast burning
[33:57] in our heart to seeking for you and we
[34:00] just ask your blessings on us in Jesus
[34:04] precious name we pray amen amen God
[34:08] bless you you may be seated at thank you

[35:39] this is my second house
[35:42] and I am happy to be among you
[35:45] this is a surprise from Brother David
[35:48] but I think
[35:51] I think if he give me opportunity I will
[35:55] do something for the people of God As
[35:58] You Are
[35:59] my English is growing because many of
[36:03] you are praying for me God bless you
[36:11] amen so we know that speaking in tongues
[36:14] is a true gift
[36:17] amen amen I appreciate that I I always
[36:21] love my brother's Spirit anyway and
[36:25] Matthew has just got back from a week in
[36:29] Romania preaching there and and reaching
[36:33] out and I'd like him to just come if he
[36:36] would at this time and just tell us a
[36:38] little bit about his trip and what he
[36:41] felt the spirit was and how it was
[36:44] moving and we're always it was your
[36:47] support that helped send him and so we'd
[36:50] just like to have him come and and uh
[36:53] you know I've got three sons that preach
[36:55] now
[36:56] that's pretty good
[36:58] you know what I mean and uh uh I
[37:02] remember Doug mchughes a good friend of
[37:05] mine he's gone to be with the Lord
[37:08] but many years ago when the boys were
[37:11] just getting converted
[37:13] and you know I think David I was one of
[37:17] the ones that got converted first and
[37:20] Matthew wasn't converted yet and David
[37:23] got converted so David went and took all
[37:27] the Matthew's stuff out of the house and
[37:29] threw him out of the house
[37:31] and I came home one day and all
[37:33] Matthew's clothes and everything was on
[37:35] the front porch because he threw him up
[37:38] and and
[37:40] Davey would wait up every night
[37:43] and tell Matthew came home to give him a
[37:47] piece of his mind
[37:49] anyway he he he was just longing for his
[37:54] brother to come to the Lord and all
[37:57] three of my sons have come to the Lord
[37:59] Aaron's pastoring in Phoenix are real
[38:01] proud of him there David just started
[38:05] preaching he's always been a testifier
[38:07] but he's just got a real loving spirit
[38:10] for the people and of course Matthew
[38:12] kind of a fireball maybe I was like that
[38:15] when I was his age I don't know but
[38:18] anyway I'm just proud of what he's doing
[38:21] and the opportunities that are opening
[38:24] for him he may have a trip for to Spain
[38:27] coming up so we want to keep him in
[38:29] prayer but Matthew tell us a little bit
[38:31] about the trip if you wouldn't mind
[38:36] hey man it's good to be back home
[38:39] this is where my heart is
[38:41] I've told the brothers this is this is
[38:43] where I like to be and
[38:45] and Lord keeps opening doors away from
[38:47] here but we just want you to know that
[38:49] our hearts always to be here with each
[38:51] one of you we love you dearly
[38:53] and we're we're thankful for the
[38:55] opportunity
[38:56] that God has opened up to us in Romania
[38:59] um I was praying about something we
[39:01] could do for the Lord and and when we I
[39:04] got to talk in a brother cosmen about
[39:06] something we could do and Lord opened up
[39:09] some doors for us in Romania so this
[39:11] trip back we we had about 10 we had 10
[39:13] Services
[39:15] um uh we we landed in
[39:18] um Budapest which is in the country of
[39:21] Hungary and it's a about a three hour
[39:24] drive from a rod Romania where brother
[39:25] Gabriel matinee is a a pastor who has
[39:29] been the key to Romania and a lot of
[39:33] contacts there's a lot of established
[39:36] churches in the northern part of Romania
[39:40] um and there's established Believers in
[39:43] the southern Parts but but their
[39:45] buildings and uh their churches as far
[39:47] as structures and things uh gathering in
[39:50] homes and trying to build some Churches
[39:52] and not as established in the South uh
[39:56] this this time we uh the main reason we
[39:58] went was for the Youth Camp
[40:00] but before we got to the youth camp we
[40:04] um we drove over into Iran and then from
[40:07] a rod there's about a hour or so drive
[40:09] down to Timmy shawar Romania where
[40:11] there's a church we ministered there
[40:12] Saturday night and we ministered Sunday
[40:15] morning and Sunday night at brother
[40:16] Gabriel's
[40:17] and then we drove a couple hours to
[40:19] minister in irania
[40:22] um on Monday which it's always nice to
[40:25] be there because my Uncle Dennis he he
[40:28] uh he was he ministered at that church
[40:30] some 20 uh 25 27 years ago so it's just
[40:36] it's wonderful to see that the work that
[40:38] God's been doing and how he's put the
[40:40] message on brother's Hearts to spread
[40:43] the message and so some plant some water
[40:45] but God gives the increase and so we're
[40:47] happy to be able to go in and encourage
[40:49] the the Bride of Jesus Christ and to
[40:51] spread the message so from Monday we
[40:55] went down into kalues which was about a
[40:56] three hour drive a small Church there
[40:58] and then another three or four hour
[41:01] drive into biomra for Wednesday and then
[41:05] we got to the camp for Friday where we
[41:07] preached four Services Friday night
[41:09] Saturday morning Saturday night Sunday
[41:11] morning and then we had to drive back
[41:13] after we preached Sunday but just on my
[41:16] heart for the for the Youth is just uh
[41:18] was to really
[41:20] my heart's desire for the Youth is to
[41:23] really establish them in the message of
[41:24] the hour and and not in a theology not
[41:28] in an intellectualism but in the
[41:30] revelation
[41:31] and so we the first service we we wanted
[41:35] to bring the youth to a decision
[41:38] to make a decision the second service
[41:40] was no more excuses uh it's time time to
[41:43] be Sanctified and then the third and
[41:45] fourth service was was just uh we didn't
[41:49] even really get to our notes the Lord
[41:50] just really poured out his holy spirit
[41:52] it was real Supernatural because we had
[41:53] lost our voice by the eighth service my
[41:56] voice was gone for Saturday night but as
[42:00] I stepped into the pulpit
[42:02] the Lord just gave me a supernatural
[42:06] touch to be able to minister and then
[42:08] Sunday morning when we we got to the
[42:10] pulpit uh I told the kids that you'll
[42:13] never forget the service because it
[42:14] sounds like a frog up here
[42:16] I had no voice and then um when we right
[42:19] when we took our text the anointing come
[42:21] and you can hear it on the recording God
[42:23] supernaturally gave us our voice but
[42:26] that I just my heart's desire was to
[42:28] really establish the young people into
[42:32] really getting a revelation of what
[42:35] Malachi 4 5 and the life of what this
[42:38] message produces not rules not
[42:40] regulations
[42:42] um but true Overcomers in the last days
[42:45] with with the same signs and same
[42:47] wonders the same life not not in a
[42:50] church setting but but to really
[42:52] minister to them that when you go home
[42:55] the same life of Jesus Christ the same
[42:57] life that you witnessed in the messenger
[43:00] um the same Revival that we have in the
[43:02] church house
[43:03] has to be the Revival that you live in
[43:06] every single day of your life and that's
[43:09] what the message produces is true
[43:12] Born Again filled again Daughters of God
[43:15] and when once you get that
[43:18] then it's all about living for others
[43:21] then it's about getting other people to
[43:23] the Revelation that you've received
[43:25] because that's what the Christian Life
[43:27] is In eternal life is is living for
[43:29] others so we we covet your prayers they
[43:31] worked
[43:32] they work and if it wasn't for you we
[43:35] wouldn't be able to go
[43:37] and I know many of you were praying for
[43:39] us and it made the difference so we just
[43:42] love you dearly and thank you for your
[43:44] support and uh just want to give you a
[43:47] little update so God bless you
[43:49] [Applause]
[43:54] I think that I we're all coming to the
[43:57] greater realization that the baptism of
[44:01] the Holy Ghost isn't just an experience
[44:04] though it is an experience
[44:07] but it's what that experience produces
[44:11] and that's the love of God shed abroad
[44:15] in Your Heart by the holy spirit it's
[44:18] it's the it's the key to the
[44:21] identification of the church is that
[44:24] they'll know that you are my disciples
[44:26] by your love one for another and that's
[44:31] a lot of what's on my heart tonight
[44:34] we're just we're not going to be very
[44:36] long I just want to read a scripture and
[44:40] then I'd like to go through the sixth
[44:42] chapter of the Gospel of Luke just read
[44:47] the sixth chapter of the Gospel of Luke
[44:50] and then when we're done doing that in
[44:53] Philly that leads us in a song then
[44:56] anybody that wants to go to Brahms
[44:59] afterwards I'll buy the ice cream
[45:02] is that fair
[45:04] that's fair I only do this when there's
[45:06] a small crowd
[45:08] so and if if you if you see anybody show
[45:12] up
[45:13] that wasn't here
[45:16] you don't let them get in line
[45:19] okay anyway do you love the Lord let's
[45:22] stand and turn to Ephesians
[45:26] there's uh
[45:28] so we let's turn to if that fee uh I'm
[45:32] sorry Philippians
[45:34] um
[45:37] Philippians the second chapter and the
[45:40] fifth verse
[45:42] and along with that I want to read John
[45:47] 13 17.
[45:49] and I'll read John 13 17 first very
[45:54] short verse it says if you know these
[45:57] things happy are you if ye do them
[46:02] and I I I uh I want to emphasize the joy
[46:09] that comes
[46:11] from doing good
[46:13] the the joy that comes from living God's
[46:18] word
[46:19] uh the the I I enjoy studying God's word
[46:23] and and that's in your intellectually
[46:27] stimulating uh it's marvelous how the
[46:31] scriptures have fallen together
[46:33] it's it's amazing how that God could lay
[46:38] so much of all of man's life in such a
[46:42] small book
[46:44] really but there's no part of man's
[46:46] existence that the word of God doesn't
[46:49] cover
[46:50] this this scripture is our life's blood
[46:55] it is the the joy to your heart it's the
[46:59] instruction for everything
[47:02] so happy are you if you do these things
[47:06] and then let's read Philippians the
[47:08] second chapter
[47:10] he says
[47:12] and we'll just read there starting with
[47:15] the first verse he says let nothing be
[47:19] done through Strife or vain Glory
[47:23] let nothing be done through strife
[47:27] in other words if their Strife or
[47:31] tension or friction don't do a thing
[47:35] you are in it pray till your heart's
[47:37] pure
[47:39] don't act you know one thing that we
[47:42] know never correct your children when
[47:44] you're angry
[47:46] you know what I make nothing comes out
[47:49] of it good
[47:51] uh so uh
[47:54] in fact when you do that you're teaching
[47:57] that child that it's okay that could
[48:01] that becomes normal
[48:03] in an abusive relationships where maybe
[48:07] one of the partners abuses the other one
[48:10] A child growing up and seeing that they
[48:13] think that's love they think that's
[48:15] normal and that cycle continues on as
[48:19] Aaron preached one time a great message
[48:21] he's calling breaking the cycle you know
[48:24] if you don't break that cycle it'll
[48:27] continue so what a what a what a great
[48:30] lesson just there in that verse let
[48:33] nothing be done through Strife or
[48:36] vainglory
[48:37] but in lowliness of mind
[48:40] Let each esteem the other better than
[48:45] themselves
[48:49] oh my
[48:51] try that
[48:54] I don't mean fake
[48:57] right you know like I said humility is
[49:00] not the way you act it's the way you
[49:02] think if you could be humbled by the
[49:06] love of the Lord to where you look on on
[49:09] somebody else and esteem them as better
[49:13] than you because how are you esteeming
[49:15] them as the purchase price of the blood
[49:19] of the Lamb amen he says he says
[49:25] look on every man's
[49:27] on look not every man on his own things
[49:31] but every man also on the things of
[49:36] others
[49:37] let this mind be in you
[49:40] which was also in Christ Jesus
[49:44] who being in the form of God thought it
[49:48] not robbery to be equal with God but
[49:52] made himself of no reputation and took
[49:57] upon him the form of a servant and was
[50:03] made in the likeness of man now let's
[50:08] look at this mind of Christ
[50:10] all right let this mind that being you
[50:14] that was in Christ
[50:16] who being in the form of God thought it
[50:19] not Robert to be equal with God now this
[50:21] is his mind
[50:23] but made himself of no reputation and
[50:27] took upon him the form of a servant
[50:32] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[50:35] word to us in your precious name we pray
[50:38] amen you may be seated
[50:42] we've been we've been preaching just a
[50:46] little bit
[50:47] about a thinking man's filter
[50:50] so what we've realized as people
[50:54] that Peter in the we know that in Peter
[50:58] he preached what we refer to as the
[51:01] statue of a perfect man add to your
[51:04] faith you know he says you know so she
[51:07] you'll add your faith uh virtue and
[51:10] virtue patience and and you add these
[51:13] virtues and when it all comes together
[51:15] it comes to the Capstone which is the
[51:19] love of God and so we realized that we
[51:23] the carnal mind is enmity against God so
[51:27] the carnal mind doesn't think the way
[51:29] God thinks the carnal mind Minds the
[51:33] things of the flesh that Minds the
[51:35] things of the world it's it's the nature
[51:38] of man and that's what we're trying to
[51:41] overcome we're trying to overcome our
[51:44] nature because we know the battle is in
[51:47] our mind that's where the Battleground
[51:49] is the word of God comes and and the the
[51:53] census and the emotions and everything
[51:57] they speak to us so we realize that
[52:00] we've come to the understanding that we
[52:04] have to take
[52:05] all of our thinking no matter what
[52:09] stimulated that thinking what caused
[52:12] that thinking you know whether no matter
[52:16] what it is and we've got to stop
[52:19] recognize that thinking isolate that
[52:23] thinking away from ourselves if I could
[52:27] say that and take that thinking and
[52:30] filter it through the word of God until
[52:34] we have the mind of Christ because the
[52:39] word of God is the mind of the Lord
[52:44] that's what a word is it's a thought
[52:47] expressed
[52:48] all through the Old Testament God
[52:51] expressed his love for Israel he
[52:53] expressed his Redemption for Israel he
[52:56] expressed his forgiveness for Israel
[52:58] everything about his nature was shown in
[53:03] how that he treated the Seed of Abraham
[53:06] the Royal Seed of Abraham which was the
[53:09] children of faith and so he built
[53:12] everything on that so we're
[53:14] understanding we're starting to realize
[53:17] that yes we we've got a carnal mind but
[53:21] that carnal Minds against God but the
[53:24] spiritual mind is life and so you can't
[53:28] come up with a spiritual mind from a
[53:33] carnal source
[53:35] you can't educate yourself into a
[53:39] spiritual mind because all your
[53:42] resources are fleshly
[53:45] okay so you're you're not going to build
[53:47] something that's spiritual from
[53:50] something that's flesh it will read that
[53:53] in the scripture that good figs don't
[53:56] come from thistles
[53:58] so there's no way for that life to come
[54:03] from any resource you have in yourself
[54:06] so that that makes me happy
[54:09] because it's not going to be held
[54:12] accountable to me for my flesh to
[54:15] reproduce a spiritual mind
[54:18] the only thing that can produce a
[54:21] spiritual mind is the spirit
[54:26] isn't that right and so what is the gift
[54:29] of God it's eternal life it's the spirit
[54:33] of the Lord that's what God wants to do
[54:36] if we'll repent of our sins will be
[54:38] baptized in his name he will send to us
[54:42] and give us the gift of his spirit
[54:45] now what does the Holy Spirit the Holy
[54:48] Spirit doesn't come and speak of itself
[54:51] but it brings you into remembrance of
[54:55] all the things that he taught
[55:00] wonderful so what's it going to do the
[55:04] Holy Spirit himself is going to present
[55:06] to you the filter
[55:10] and so what's a filter do it takes out
[55:13] all the impurities so when you start
[55:16] filtering your thinking through the word
[55:18] of God the word of God is going to
[55:20] change the way you think so when you get
[55:23] through the filter you're going to end
[55:26] up with the Holy Ghost
[55:30] you filter every thought until there's
[55:34] nothing left but the Holy Ghost
[55:37] and you know there's a lot of questions
[55:40] about the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[55:41] but we know one thing the evidence of
[55:44] the holy spirit is to say Amen to every
[55:48] word of God so what what the amen is is
[55:51] when the word of God It Go your thoughts
[55:55] go through the filter
[55:56] everything that the word produces you
[55:59] say Amen what is only amen mean
[56:03] so be it
[56:05] so be it I accept this as the way that
[56:08] it is I accept this as the outcome this
[56:12] is the word this is my reality my
[56:15] perception has to be filtered until I
[56:19] accept the reality of the word and say
[56:23] so be it
[56:25] so
[56:27] we understand then that if God had a
[56:30] word he had to have a thought before
[56:33] that word and the word is the expression
[56:37] of his thinking
[56:39] and so if you go back and you start
[56:41] studying
[56:43] uh the things that the Lord preaches
[56:46] you'll find out that that his whole
[56:50] approach to all of Israel was changing
[56:54] their thinking
[56:56] why because he's taking them from the
[56:59] law
[57:00] right to Grace
[57:05] that's what he's doing
[57:07] it said an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[57:11] tooth but I say unto you
[57:13] you know can you so you read the
[57:15] Beatitudes you read his approach he's
[57:17] actually trying to say God's doing
[57:20] something for you so now I want you to
[57:23] start looking and changing the way that
[57:26] you think so I wanted to read this sixth
[57:30] chapter because
[57:32] as you go through it you start to see
[57:35] that Jesus is a a dressing I was going
[57:39] to use the word attacking but I I don't
[57:42] think that he did anything out of malice
[57:46] I think that him in addressing it was to
[57:50] try to break the chain that they have
[57:54] and sometimes we get a chain in our mind
[57:57] that's what a complex is a complex is
[58:00] when you have a chain on your mind and
[58:03] you can't break that thinking
[58:06] so it has you and and we want to break
[58:11] any thinking so this sixth chapter is a
[58:15] marvelous chapter and and so
[58:19] uh let's just uh read it together and
[58:23] I'm not a very good reader so you you
[58:24] fill right in for me
[58:27] it says and it came to pass on the
[58:29] second Sabbath after the first
[58:32] that he went through the cornfield
[58:35] and his disciples plucked the ears of
[58:39] corn and did eat
[58:41] rubbing them with their hands
[58:44] and certain of the Pharisees said unto
[58:48] them
[58:48] why do ye that which is not lawful
[58:54] to do on the Sabbath day
[58:58] so see they're thinking
[59:01] right it's not lawful
[59:03] to pick the corn
[59:05] and wipe it with your hands on the
[59:08] Sabbath
[59:09] now Jesus is now approaching that
[59:13] thinking
[59:14] and Jesus answered them
[59:17] and Jesus answering them said
[59:20] have you not read
[59:22] so much as this
[59:25] what David did
[59:27] when himself
[59:30] was unhungered
[59:32] and they which were with him
[59:35] how he went into the house of God
[59:40] and it take and eat
[59:43] the showbread and gave also to them that
[59:48] were with him which is not lawful to eat
[59:52] but for the priest alone
[59:55] and he said unto them
[59:57] that the son of man is Lord also of the
[1:00:01] Sabbath
[1:00:03] and it came to pass also on another
[1:00:06] Sabbath
[1:00:08] that he entered into the synagogue and
[1:00:11] taught
[1:00:12] and there was a man whose right hand was
[1:00:16] withered and the scribes and the
[1:00:19] Pharisees watched him whether he would
[1:00:23] heal on the Sabbath day that they might
[1:00:27] find an accusation against them now look
[1:00:32] at their mindsets
[1:00:34] okay okay now we look at their mindset
[1:00:38] but
[1:00:39] we've got to the scripture can't be
[1:00:42] upset of binoculars
[1:00:44] it's got to be a mirror
[1:00:48] you understand we find ourselves
[1:00:51] having a lot of these presumptuous
[1:00:54] thinkings and judgments
[1:00:58] you know uh
[1:01:01] and and so they're they're just sitting
[1:01:04] there
[1:01:05] they are so
[1:01:07] locked in
[1:01:10] to their prejudicial
[1:01:12] judgment mind
[1:01:16] that he's going to start attacking I I
[1:01:20] didn't want to use that word
[1:01:22] he's not attacking them he's he's
[1:01:26] addressing that
[1:01:29] legalistic
[1:01:31] mindset
[1:01:33] that's depriving them from Common Sense
[1:01:37] thinking
[1:01:40] so now these guys are all religious
[1:01:44] I mean they are
[1:01:46] they're the scribes they're the
[1:01:48] Pharisees they're all dressed up they're
[1:01:50] they're really things so he so they
[1:01:53] might find an accusation against them
[1:01:56] but he knew their thoughts
[1:01:58] so he knew their what
[1:02:01] thinking
[1:02:02] do you think he knows your thinking
[1:02:04] amen you think he might want to deal
[1:02:07] with your mind
[1:02:09] I think he does don't you
[1:02:11] he does me
[1:02:14] but he knew their thoughts and said to
[1:02:17] the man
[1:02:18] which had the withered hand rise up
[1:02:22] and stand forth in the midst
[1:02:25] and he rose and stood forth
[1:02:28] then Jesus said unto them
[1:02:31] I will ask you one thing
[1:02:34] is it lawful on the Sabbath day
[1:02:38] to do good
[1:02:41] or to do evil
[1:02:43] to save life or to destroy it
[1:02:51] can you imagine they never ever thought
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:56] but
[1:02:57] why could he say that because he was the
[1:03:01] maker of the law
[1:03:03] now he's interpreting to them the
[1:03:07] intention of the law in the first place
[1:03:10] this is Grace
[1:03:16] and looking around about upon them all
[1:03:20] he said unto the man stretch forth by
[1:03:24] hand
[1:03:25] and he did so
[1:03:28] and his hand was restored whole as the
[1:03:32] other
[1:03:34] praise God how many say praise God how
[1:03:37] many would have loved to have been there
[1:03:40] now this is what poison thinking does
[1:03:45] and they were filled with Madness
[1:03:52] and can communed one with another what
[1:03:56] they might do to Jesus
[1:04:00] that is a sad
[1:04:02] State of Affair
[1:04:04] I don't want to get in that State of
[1:04:06] Affair
[1:04:08] he's giving us a filter
[1:04:12] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:04:15] he went out unto the mountain to pray
[1:04:18] and continued all night and prayed to
[1:04:20] God and when it was day he called unto
[1:04:24] him his disciples and of them he chose
[1:04:28] 12 whom also he named apostles
[1:04:31] Simon his name was Peter Andrew his
[1:04:35] brother James John Philip Bartholomew
[1:04:38] Matthew and Thomas James the son of
[1:04:42] alphaeus and Simon called uh
[1:04:46] zeltus or I think and Judas the brother
[1:04:49] of James and Judas Iscariot which also
[1:04:53] was a traitor
[1:04:54] and he came down with them and stood in
[1:04:57] the plane and in the company of his
[1:05:00] disciples and a great multitude of
[1:05:03] people out of all of Judea and around
[1:05:07] Jerusalem and from the Seacoast of Tyra
[1:05:10] to sidon which came to hear him and to
[1:05:14] be healed of their diseases and and they
[1:05:18] that were vexed with unclean spirits and
[1:05:21] they were healed and the whole multitude
[1:05:24] sought to touch him for their went
[1:05:27] virtue out of him and he healed them all
[1:05:30] and he lifted up his eyes and
[1:05:33] on his disciples and said blessed be the
[1:05:37] poor for yours is the kingdom of God
[1:05:42] blessed are ye that hunger now for ye
[1:05:46] shall be filled blessed are ye that weep
[1:05:50] now for you shall laugh blessed are ye
[1:05:53] when men shall hate you and when they
[1:05:56] say shall separate you from their
[1:06:00] company and shall reproach you and cast
[1:06:03] out your name as evil for the son of
[1:06:07] man's sake rejoice in that day and leap
[1:06:13] for Joy for behold your reward is great
[1:06:17] in heaven for in in the like manner did
[1:06:22] their fathers unto the prophets but woe
[1:06:26] unto you that are rich for you have
[1:06:29] received your consolation woe unto you
[1:06:33] that are full for you shall hunger wo
[1:06:37] unto you that laugh now for you shall
[1:06:40] mourn and weep we'll unto you when all
[1:06:43] men shall speak well of you for so did
[1:06:46] they their fathers and the and fathers
[1:06:52] to the false prophets but I say unto you
[1:06:56] which cure
[1:06:58] love your enemy
[1:07:01] do good to them which hate you
[1:07:05] bless them that curse you
[1:07:09] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:07:13] you
[1:07:14] that's tough
[1:07:19] you know
[1:07:20] I usually pray for a thunderstorm
[1:07:24] you know you want you want Wrath
[1:07:28] you know can you imagine actually being
[1:07:31] such control of your spirit
[1:07:34] when someone despitefully uses you
[1:07:37] because someone says evil about you you
[1:07:40] have such control over your spirit
[1:07:44] such control over your emotions
[1:07:47] such control over the your reaction that
[1:07:52] you're not offended
[1:07:55] in their vile conversation
[1:07:59] but you rejoice
[1:08:01] praise God
[1:08:03] thank you Father
[1:08:05] and you actually pray for him
[1:08:08] now this is who he's coming for
[1:08:12] he's not coming for your theology
[1:08:15] he's coming for your character he's
[1:08:18] coming for your heart
[1:08:22] now hold that
[1:08:24] about your heart because he's going to
[1:08:27] touch on that okay so let's just read he
[1:08:31] said
[1:08:34] um
[1:08:37] and he says but I send you
[1:08:40] which here
[1:08:42] I send you which here
[1:08:46] love your enemies do good to them which
[1:08:49] hate you
[1:08:50] bless them that curse you and pray for
[1:08:55] them which despitefully use you now this
[1:08:58] is a brand new way of thinking this is
[1:09:00] Grace
[1:09:02] it's the same thing the father's doing
[1:09:05] to you father forgive us our sins as we
[1:09:08] forgive those that trespass against us
[1:09:11] so he's expressing what the father has
[1:09:14] done to us now he's wanting this mind to
[1:09:17] be in us that was also in Christ Jesus
[1:09:22] and unto him that smiteth thee on the
[1:09:27] One Cheek also
[1:09:29] offer also the other
[1:09:32] and him that taketh away thy cloak
[1:09:36] forbidden not to take thy coat also
[1:09:41] give to every man that asketh of Thee
[1:09:46] and of him that
[1:09:49] taketh away
[1:09:53] thy Goods ask them not again
[1:10:00] my
[1:10:03] how does that one set with you
[1:10:08] I almost think maybe California
[1:10:10] scriptural right you can go in and take
[1:10:13] 800 out of the store and nobody says
[1:10:17] anything
[1:10:19] I'm just saying what he said if someone
[1:10:22] come asks not back for it if they take
[1:10:24] what's yours
[1:10:27] this is this is I uh how do you get this
[1:10:30] mind
[1:10:33] you get this Mind by meeting The Thinker
[1:10:36] himself
[1:10:42] and as ye would that men should do to
[1:10:47] you do ye also to them likewise
[1:10:51] for if you love them which love you what
[1:10:55] thanks have ye for Sinners also love
[1:10:58] those that love them and if you did good
[1:11:01] to them which do good to you what thanks
[1:11:06] have ye for Sinners also do even the
[1:11:11] same
[1:11:12] and if you leak lend to them of whom ye
[1:11:16] hope to receive
[1:11:17] what thanks have ye for Sinners also
[1:11:22] lend to Sinners to receive as much again
[1:11:27] but
[1:11:28] but love your enemies
[1:11:31] and do good
[1:11:33] and lend hoping for nothing again
[1:11:38] and your reward shall be great and ye
[1:11:42] shall be the children of the highest
[1:11:46] for he is kind unto the unthankful and
[1:11:52] to
[1:11:54] the evil
[1:11:57] you know we just think God's just a big
[1:11:59] old ball of Wrath up there
[1:12:02] nope
[1:12:04] he's kind
[1:12:08] to the unthankful
[1:12:10] and to the evil
[1:12:13] be their merciful
[1:12:15] as your father also is merciful
[1:12:18] judge not and ye shall not be judged
[1:12:22] condemn not and ye shall not be
[1:12:26] condemned forgive and ye shall be
[1:12:31] forgiven
[1:12:34] a lot of wisdom right there
[1:12:37] give and it shall be given unto you
[1:12:41] good measure pressed down shaken
[1:12:44] together and running over shall give
[1:12:48] unto your bosom for with the same
[1:12:51] measure that ye meant with all it shall
[1:12:55] be measured to you again
[1:12:57] and he spoke the parable unto them can
[1:13:01] the blind lead the blind
[1:13:03] shall they
[1:13:05] not both fall into the ditch so now he's
[1:13:09] he's addressing all this negative
[1:13:12] thinking
[1:13:13] that he's just talked about
[1:13:16] you know getting your own asking for it
[1:13:18] back you know that's my cloak and I want
[1:13:22] it back in lending and then he sums all
[1:13:25] of that up as being blindness
[1:13:30] can the blind lead the blind in other
[1:13:34] words who can't they see they can't see
[1:13:38] the god that's merciful
[1:13:41] to be unthankful
[1:13:44] and kind
[1:13:45] to the evil
[1:13:49] if you can set your eyes on him that's
[1:13:53] reality
[1:13:55] and so he says he says can the blind
[1:13:58] lead the blind won't they both fall in
[1:14:01] the ditch this the disciple is not above
[1:14:05] his master but everyone that is perfect
[1:14:09] shall be as
[1:14:12] his master
[1:14:15] that our goal he's talking to us about
[1:14:19] what real Perfection is it isn't the
[1:14:22] doctrine
[1:14:23] though you must have sound Doctrine
[1:14:26] because false Doctrine will create a
[1:14:29] deceptive perception of God
[1:14:33] that's the purpose of twisting the word
[1:14:36] is so you don't see God for what he
[1:14:39] really is aren't you glad for a
[1:14:41] messenger
[1:14:43] that divinely interpreted the word so we
[1:14:47] could see the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:51] and he said
[1:14:55] and why beholdest thouk the moat in thy
[1:14:59] brother's eye
[1:15:01] but perceiveth not the beam that is in
[1:15:05] thine own eye
[1:15:08] neither
[1:15:10] how can this doubt say to thy brother
[1:15:13] brother let me pull out the moat that is
[1:15:17] in thine eye when thou thyself
[1:15:21] beholdest not the beam that is in thine
[1:15:25] own eye look you you that's beautiful
[1:15:28] because you can't do nothing for nobody
[1:15:31] else until you can look at yourself
[1:15:39] the word has got to become a mirror not
[1:15:44] binoculars
[1:15:46] how can you do anything for anybody else
[1:15:49] until you can perceive your own
[1:15:52] weaknesses your own failures then you
[1:15:55] can have compassion
[1:15:58] he that
[1:16:00] he says Thou hypocrite
[1:16:03] cast out first The Beam out of thine own
[1:16:06] eye then shalt thou See Clearly
[1:16:12] to pull out the moat that is in that
[1:16:15] brother's eye for a good treat bringeth
[1:16:18] not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a
[1:16:23] corrupt tree bringeth forth good fruit
[1:16:26] for every tree is known by his own fruit
[1:16:30] for of a Thorns men do not gather figs
[1:16:35] nor of Bramble Bush do that gather
[1:16:39] gather they grapes a good man out of the
[1:16:44] good Treasures of his heart
[1:16:48] bringeth forth that which is good and an
[1:16:52] evil man out of the evil Treasures of
[1:16:55] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[1:16:58] evil for of the abundance of the heart
[1:17:03] his mouth
[1:17:05] speak it
[1:17:11] carnal mind is enmity with God
[1:17:14] in other words until we filter our
[1:17:18] thinking we cannot produce gospel fruit
[1:17:23] which can produce good works
[1:17:27] that appear to be it you can do a good
[1:17:31] work with a bad heart
[1:17:33] but there's nothing that pleases God
[1:17:36] more than a pure heart
[1:17:39] now let's listen he says speak
[1:17:42] and why call ye Me Lord
[1:17:45] when
[1:17:46] and do not the things which I say
[1:17:50] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[1:17:54] sayings and doth them I will show you to
[1:18:00] whom he is like
[1:18:03] to hear his words and to do
[1:18:08] how important is that
[1:18:11] listen
[1:18:12] he is like a man which buildeth a house
[1:18:15] and dig it deep and lay the foundation
[1:18:19] on a rock
[1:18:22] and when the floods arose the stream
[1:18:25] beat
[1:18:26] vehemently up upon that house and could
[1:18:31] not shake it for it was founded upon a
[1:18:36] rock
[1:18:37] but he that heareth and doth not is like
[1:18:43] a man
[1:18:44] that without a foundation buildeth a
[1:18:48] house upon the Earth
[1:18:50] again which the streams did Veet
[1:18:53] vehemently and immediately it fell in
[1:18:57] the ruin of that house
[1:18:59] was great
[1:19:01] isn't the word marvelous
[1:19:04] I I really think for myself
[1:19:08] that I must go back to this word
[1:19:12] with the intention
[1:19:15] of not studying it but of washing
[1:19:20] my mind
[1:19:22] the renewing of your mind by the washing
[1:19:26] of the water of the word to let this
[1:19:30] mind be in us that was in Christ Jesus
[1:19:33] to Humble ourselves to the mighty hand
[1:19:36] of the Lord and will be exalted in due
[1:19:40] season amen you love the word I just
