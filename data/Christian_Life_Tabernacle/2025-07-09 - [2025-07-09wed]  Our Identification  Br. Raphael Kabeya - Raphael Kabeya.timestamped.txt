[12:01] my
[12:03] we'll just open the service in prayer as
[12:06] take up the tithes and offerings just
[12:08] ask brother Tim Siler to come and
[12:13] didn't have any prayer requests turned
[12:15] in but if you have maybe a an unspoken
[12:17] prayer request or you want to be
[12:19] remembered in prayer if you want to just
[12:20] go ahead and by an uplifted hand, God
[12:23] sees that hand.
[12:25] [Music]
[12:26] Amen. And also, we just want to remember
[12:28] the many needs that have been made uh
[12:31] known before the church. And also, our
[12:34] pastor, Brother David and Sister Lesley,
[12:36] are traveling back. There's been, I
[12:37] believe, some maybe storms or certain
[12:39] things that have kept them on the tarmac
[12:41] for time. And just pray that God would
[12:44] open up a way and bring them home
[12:45] quickly. So, we want to remember them in
[12:47] prayer. And just remember uh brother
[12:50] Raphael Cabay. He'll be ministering to
[12:52] us tonight. And I'm looking forward to
[12:54] what God would have in store. Amen.
[12:57] Also, if the brothers would just be
[12:58] ready to take up the tithes and
[13:00] offerings. Amen.
[13:03] Welcome to the house of the Lord. Amen.
[13:05] Been taught the universal sign of
[13:07] surrender.
[13:12] Let's bow our heads.
[13:15] Our gracious and kind heavenly father.
[13:17] Lord, as we gather tonight, there's
[13:20] many needs,
[13:22] Lord, both upon our hearts, in our
[13:24] minds, upon our lips.
[13:28] Lord, there's expressions
[13:31] of woe, discomfort, homesickness,
[13:35] [Music]
[13:37] confusion,
[13:40] but Lord, we lay all these things down.
[13:44] Put them aside, Lord.
[13:47] even the direest of needs.
[13:50] For there's one need, Lord, that remains
[13:52] greater than any other is to draw closer
[13:54] to you. To have you reveal more of your
[13:57] word to us, Lord.
[14:00] For Paul taught us when you've done all
[14:03] you can do to stand.
[14:06] Stand therefore.
[14:09] So Lord, tonight we stand on your word
[14:11] by faith believing Lord that you're in
[14:13] our midst that you hear our prayer
[14:17] and Lord, your desire is to give us what
[14:20] we have need of.
[14:21] Hallelujah.
[14:21] So Lord, we just want to draw closer to
[14:23] you for having been in the service. And
[14:25] when your word comes forth, Lord, may we
[14:28] agree with it, we say amen to it, and
[14:31] we'll receive the promise that all of
[14:34] the problems can be solved, Lord.
[14:39] We just ask Lord as we sing these songs
[14:41] and lift up praise to you Lord. Lord
[14:43] that you can just
[14:46] hover over us, walk the aisles, touch
[14:49] those that are sick and body, that have
[14:51] needs, Lord, maybe tired.
[14:55] Lord, just comfort us. I pray just by
[14:57] being together. Lord, there's something
[14:59] about fellowship and coming together,
[15:01] assembling ourselves in the house of the
[15:03] Lord that's a benefit to us. Lord, we
[15:06] just lean on you.
[15:08] Use the tithes and offerings for your
[15:10] honor and your glory. Use us as you'd
[15:12] see fit. We ask in the name of the Lord
[15:14] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[15:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. And you may have
[15:18] your seats.
[15:20] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[15:24] walk
[15:26] for the hand of God in all my life. I
[15:30] see.

[15:35] secret of this at the top of my way. Oh,

[35:14] Our
[35:17] objective is for everybody to now turn
[35:20] towards him
[35:26] because there's nothing else outside of
[35:28] him that we can count on in this world.
[35:34] So I'd like to speak on a a very little
[35:37] subject tonight.
[35:41] Our identification.
[35:43] [Music]
[35:46] Uh let's take our Bibles in Romans
[35:48] chapter 6
[35:52] from the first verse.
[36:16] What shall we say then? Shall we
[36:18] continue in sin that grace may abound?
[36:27] God forbid. How shall we that are dead
[36:31] in sin live any longer therein?
[36:42] Know ye not that? Know ye not that so
[36:45] many of us were baptized in Jesus
[36:48] Christ, were baptized into his death.
[37:04] Therefore, we are buried with him by the
[37:06] baptism into death. That like Christ was
[37:11] baptized was baptized up from the dead
[37:14] by glory uh by the glory of by the glory
[37:17] of the father. Even so, we are we should
[37:21] walk in the newness of life.
[37:24] Our gracious father,
[37:28] come and help us now,
[37:32] bless my brothers translating me
[37:37] that we may be on the same channel
[37:41] that everything may be clear for your
[37:43] children
[37:45] in once again thank you
[37:49] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:51] Amen. You may have your seats.
[38:01] I bring you all the greetings of our
[38:02] from our church in Brazville.
[38:07] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[38:09] Jesus Christ.
[38:13] Like I I I announce I'm going to speak
[38:15] on a little subject,
[38:18] our identification.
[38:20] Amen.
[38:24] We have to identify with something.
[38:31] You know that when Jesus was here on
[38:33] earth,
[38:35] [Music]
[38:38] he dressed like every man would dress.
[38:45] He had a long hair and he wore uh he had
[38:48] a beard like anybody else.
[38:54] He was not trying to distinguish himself
[38:57] from others
[38:59] or try to be different from others,
[39:05] but it was his life
[39:09] that was speaking of his identity.
[39:15] His life was speaking of who was he was
[39:18] truly
[39:22] And I believe that's what God wants us
[39:25] Christians to be.
[39:31] He wants that our lives be our identity.
[39:39] So as my sun is setting
[39:45] and my days are shortening,
[39:48] I'm very conscious of that.
[39:54] The most important thing for me at this
[39:56] moment,
[40:00] the thing to which I aspire the most
[40:04] is to be like Christ.
[40:12] to be like Christ to follow him to
[40:14] identify myself with him. That's the
[40:16] thing.
[40:24] Okay.
[40:31] It's the desire of each one of us to be
[40:34] identified with Christ.
[40:43] And I believe to be in the to be made in
[40:47] in the image of Christ makes you makes
[40:50] you identified with Christ.
[40:54] [Music]
[40:55] It's not what we show on the outside.
[41:03] It's what what's happening inside that
[41:07] shows who we really are
[41:11] in uh images of Christ. The prophet will
[41:15] say paragraph
[41:16] paragraph 33.
[41:22] So if he's our image
[41:27] and we are at his we are in his image.
[41:32] and members of his body.
[41:34] [Music]
[41:36] We have to be like him.
[41:41] Each one of us, we have to be like him.
[41:50] We have to look at ourselves and ask,
[41:53] are we trying to be like him in our
[41:55] everyday life?
[41:58] Our
[42:00] lives should reflect the life of Christ,
[42:06] not to joining to a church
[42:10] or to where uh to to to put a crucifix
[42:16] or in our emotions
[42:20] in in in shouting or in in in emotions
[42:23] and screaming.
[42:27] [Music]
[42:32] But that had to be the life of Christ.
[42:34] Uh that's that the life of Christ living
[42:38] God that's reflected through our lives
[42:42] and and sometimes it's with very little
[42:45] noise.
[42:47] Just like the the sun works,
[42:51] you don't hear any agitation from the
[42:54] sun.
[42:56] I believe in emotions
[43:00] but the emotions doesn't transform you.
[43:06] We want a resurrected Christ
[43:11] who's living among us.
[43:17] making himself known and confirming
[43:19] himself yesterday, today, and forever
[43:24] without you saying a word.
[43:30] Just looking at you and coming in
[43:32] contact with you, we notice that you are
[43:34] someone different.
[43:37] That's what the church has need of.
[43:44] That's what members of the church have
[43:46] need of so they can uh uh uh focus the
[43:50] the the the gifts and everything
[43:54] to have the true Christ in us
[43:57] not just emotions
[44:00] but Christ living in us
[44:06] it it helps focus our emotions and our
[44:09] gifts.
[44:12] And like his servants and his servants,
[44:23] we have received the commission to carry
[44:25] out exactly as he's been uh uh uh
[44:29] ordained or shown in the message of the
[44:32] hour
[44:34] that uh uh men uh uh uh men and women
[44:38] daughters of God
[44:44] may be identified to to Christ and live
[44:47] in in in unity.
[44:52] The prophet said in why the little
[44:54] Bethlehem
[44:56] paragraph 127
[45:03] uh and 128
[45:08] I don't worship a Jew.
[45:13] I worship God when I worship Jesus
[45:16] Christ.
[45:19] Because Jesus Christ is the only and
[45:22] true God.
[45:27] I don't worship a fiction or something
[45:30] in the history.
[45:32] I worship Jesus Christ,
[45:37] the presence of Jesus Christ right now,
[45:41] [Music]
[45:44] which is the word that's manifested in
[45:46] this age.
[45:49] This message,
[45:53] this message of the end time,
[45:57] it's nothing but Jesus Christ himself
[46:01] because he's the word.
[46:04] In the beginning was the word.
[46:06] The word was with God. The word was God.
[46:11] And tonight,
[46:14] the same spoken word that created the
[46:16] world.
[46:19] Then we have something real.
[46:27] God has allotted to each generation a
[46:30] portion of his word
[46:33] from the beginning
[46:37] and in which of those ages passed by.
[46:43] God sends an anointed prophet for that
[46:46] age and for this age.
[46:50] We know the anointed prophet
[46:54] many wanted to take his place.
[46:57] Many they they they replaced him
[47:01] but the prophet remains the same
[47:04] and the message remains the same.
[47:07] [Music]
[47:09] All that make noise will pass away, but
[47:11] the word remains the same.
[47:14] In the time of Noah,
[47:17] in the days of the rest of them,
[47:20] when he made the promises,
[47:26] I don't care what kind of condition the
[47:29] church got into,
[47:32] he always does that.
[47:35] He sends a man anointed
[47:39] and I believe you have anointed men
[47:41] among you
[47:44] that would only bring you this message
[47:47] as the time is coming to an end.
[47:52] And if we can all try to identify with
[47:54] Christ,
[47:57] the time of manifestation is already
[47:59] here
[48:02] where sons and daughters of God have to
[48:04] be manifested.
[48:06] In fact,
[48:09] the word of God comes to the prophet
[48:14] and here he stood there each prophet
[48:20] and was condemned by organization of
[48:22] that day.
[48:27] He stood on the word and made the word
[48:30] live.
[48:32] The message that we have received
[48:37] If we give it the first place when we
[48:39] take it,
[48:42] it's a living word.
[48:49] And every new person who comes in
[48:52] contact with this message, they feel
[48:54] it's something different.
[48:57] And when there's a good atmosphere
[49:00] where people realize
[49:04] that Christ himself is here in our
[49:06] midst,
[49:09] [Music]
[49:10] the sick will be healed just by
[49:13] listening to the to the word.
[49:15] [Music]
[49:19] be
[49:19] people could be delivered just by
[49:21] listening to the word because there's
[49:23] everything in the word
[49:27] just the word not actions
[49:34] God wants the his church to be to feed
[49:38] upon the word of that that season of the
[49:41] season
[49:42] that's why Malachi 4 says
[49:46] that in divine services
[49:52] we hear more the words of men than the
[49:55] words of God.
[49:57] That's what we hear the most.
[50:00] We make a lot of noise. We make we do a
[50:03] lot of gestures.
[50:06] It was almost like we are in a the uh
[50:09] theater. But here
[50:12] we are in the presence of the living
[50:14] God.
[50:17] That's why this is called a sanctuary
[50:21] because the holy God is here.
[50:24] It's bringing us to be conscious of that
[50:29] and he can do a lot of good things in
[50:31] our midst.
[50:33] The prophet says
[50:35] in the divine services
[50:40] we hear more the words of men than we do
[50:42] the words of God.
[50:46] people they talk a lot the whichever
[50:48] manner they choose to
[50:51] and they make dissertation upon like
[50:54] they want to my my my my friends
[51:01] all that we have need of from the new
[51:03] birth until the glory
[51:08] is only in this message that is the
[51:10] spoken word
[51:18] Only a lived message will give people
[51:21] the thirst for them to come to Christ.
[51:26] We speaking about our identification.
[51:29] Let me insist on that.
[51:32] Only the message that's lived
[51:36] [Music]
[51:38] will give people the thirst for them to
[51:40] identify with it.
[51:43] to identify with Christ.
[51:47] The creator who humbled himself
[51:50] before his own creation.
[51:53] The creator, the creator,
[51:56] he's mixing himself with his creation.
[52:01] He's looking like his own creation.
[52:05] That's not what we see today.
[52:07] We see a great man.
[52:10] They look at you like this.
[52:12] What are we looking for?
[52:14] The great Jehovah,
[52:16] he made himself a simple
[52:19] like a a mortal being.
[52:22] We want that kind of identification.
[52:31] It's not about knowledge
[52:35] but life lived.
[52:40] bring forth the desire for
[52:42] identification
[52:47] will say in a message from that time
[52:51] paragraph 25
[53:01] let's take few mens that that have met
[53:03] God and it's changed the destiny of
[53:06] their life and the life of the people in
[53:09] their generations
[53:11] Let's take for instance Abraham.
[53:13] Abraham,
[53:16] he was just an ordinary man.
[53:21] And when Jesus came,
[53:24] just like an ordinary man,
[53:28] it was uh uh looked down upon
[53:32] but it was a creator,
[53:36] an ordinary man.
[53:39] He was not a saint.
[53:42] He was just a man.
[53:50] [Music]
[53:51] Oh, I'm glad that we don't have to be
[53:54] born in a certain line
[53:57] or be somebody or be some great
[54:01] somebody.
[54:04] We just have to be humble.
[54:08] God's grace is what does the workmen
[54:12] I didn't I don't have anything good
[54:14] I cannot give anybody anything
[54:17] but the grace of God
[54:19] is what does everything
[54:23] Abraham was only a man
[54:28] uh perhaps in in in bushes one day
[54:32] in the valley
[54:34] in the senior sino
[54:37] and was going out to cities
[54:41] come out of the city of Earth,
[54:46] wandering about in the in the bush maybe
[54:50] with a ship or a ship and so forth.
[54:56] And God met him and God spoke to him and
[55:00] blessed him.
[55:02] God met him,
[55:05] spoke to him
[55:07] and blessed him.
[55:13] I believe that a man comes to God
[55:19] and has a a definite experience.
[55:26] Oh, maybe you think I'm beside myself,
[55:30] but look,
[55:32] [Music]
[55:35] I don't mean an impersonation of
[55:37] experience.
[55:44] We've got so much of that today till it
[55:48] till it makes a real Christian sick to
[55:50] look at it.
[55:52] [Music]
[55:53] Somebody trying to impersonate somebody
[55:56] else
[55:58] even to imitate the voice
[56:01] to impersonate the way of prayer
[56:05] to imitate the
[56:08] imitate how to jump and how to
[56:11] see all of that everywhere.
[56:14] But the prophet says
[56:23] [Music]
[56:25] God has never made two the same.
[56:33] He never did and never will.
[56:38] God is a God of variety.
[56:44] He makes big hills and little hills
[56:48] and deserts and swamps land
[56:51] and what whatever more.
[56:55] He's a god of variety.
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] Don't try to impersonate anybody anyone
[57:03] else.
[57:05] Be what you are,
[57:08] what God made you,
[57:11] and then you will be a blessing.
[57:15] Uh uh uh impersonation doesn't even help
[57:19] yourself.
[57:20] The prophet says,
[57:25] [Music]
[57:26] "God has difficulties finding somebody
[57:29] with him he could work with.
[57:36] I mean question and answer of uh uh uh
[57:40] June 28, 1959.
[57:43] Listen,
[57:48] God has difficulties finding somebody
[57:51] with him. He could work,
[57:54] somebody who will remain humble
[57:57] and and and and and quiet.
[58:01] Do
[58:06] soft
[58:12] and meek and stay in place until God
[58:16] calls him to do something.
[58:18] You believe that?
[58:20] See,
[58:24] somebody that God can bless
[58:27] and still still keeps himself a man.
[58:31] Listen to that.
[58:38] Someone that God can bless and and he
[58:41] still can keep himself a man,
[58:47] not be an angel or a God
[58:53] who's not going to try to uh uh uh uh uh
[58:57] build himself up. Oh, I'm this. I did
[59:00] this. have done that.
[59:05] A man that God can anoint and signs and
[59:08] wonders are following,
[59:10] but he remains a man.
[59:12] Simple,
[59:12] simple,
[59:14] humble,
[59:14] humble,
[59:17] it's something that's rare.
[59:21] As soon as a man gets blessed
[59:25] and has a little something given to him,
[59:28] he wants to become a god.
[59:31] He wants to become an angel.
[59:34] He wants to become some great person.
[59:38] I want what I do and me and mine and all
[59:43] that.
[59:47] the the the uh uh saints of God, they
[59:51] don't take that
[59:54] because they have something in them that
[59:56] cannot stand those kind of things.
[59:58] They know their God,
[1:00:00] the almighty,
[1:00:02] the omnipotent
[1:00:04] who came as a simple man.
[1:00:07] And when a man stands before you
[1:00:11] and he he he he tries to pass himself as
[1:00:13] God.
[1:00:15] I don't know how you can follow that.
[1:00:24] That's a wrong attitude.
[1:00:28] God is hunting for somebody he could
[1:00:31] blessed
[1:00:33] and pour out the blessings.
[1:00:39] And the more he's blessed, the little
[1:00:41] the man will become.
[1:00:46] God hidden and revealing simplicity.
[1:00:51] My my my dear friends,
[1:00:55] I want just to show you the
[1:00:57] identification
[1:00:59] and I and I I I know you're seeing it.
[1:01:03] I don't I don't need to make a lot of
[1:01:05] comments.
[1:01:07] So the word as is spoken
[1:01:11] is is helping you somewhere.
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] He's helping you to identify to that one
[1:01:18] other person
[1:01:22] who had everything but living like he
[1:01:24] didn't have any.
[1:01:30] Uh Revelation chapter 4
[1:01:33] uh first part paragraph 17.
[1:01:40] And many times people understand wrong.
[1:01:45] And when they say
[1:01:50] you are you are
[1:01:54] you don't go
[1:01:57] you don't go to places like you used to
[1:01:59] go that other ministers go to
[1:02:02] and they have all have a
[1:02:07] it's people talking to the prophet
[1:02:08] not
[1:02:09] a messenger
[1:02:11] they say this
[1:02:15] I learned something
[1:02:19] in taking a lesson from the Bible and
[1:02:22] from our Lord
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:25] that Jesus was not a man with
[1:02:28] spectacles.
[1:02:31] That was not in him.
[1:02:34] He didn't he he wasn't looking for
[1:02:37] spectacles.
[1:02:38] You see,
[1:02:43] he was not a man with spectacles.
[1:02:50] And I don't believe his disciples are
[1:02:52] the same way.
[1:02:56] Are we his disciples?
[1:02:58] The prophet says,
[1:03:01] "I don't think his disciples
[1:03:05] are going to be people that are looking
[1:03:06] for things sort of great spectacle."
[1:03:11] They never showed themselves as being
[1:03:13] people looking for spectacles
[1:03:17] because they have to identify to the
[1:03:19] master
[1:03:21] and that master is here.
[1:03:26] I'm telling you the truth is here
[1:03:29] because he's the word.
[1:03:36] I think that's where we've missed the
[1:03:38] thing today.
[1:03:41] Maybe it's my personal opinion.
[1:03:48] It's when we're trying to demonstrate a
[1:03:50] big something,
[1:03:52] you know,
[1:03:59] I think that looks more like a
[1:04:01] spectacles than it would to something
[1:04:03] that's holy.
[1:04:07] Here we are serving a holy God, a sacred
[1:04:10] God.
[1:04:12] We have to realize that he's here.
[1:04:16] And I have a lot of testimonies
[1:04:20] that of people that came to the church
[1:04:25] They they observing the the the just the
[1:04:28] the calmness,
[1:04:30] the the serenity
[1:04:33] and and the word
[1:04:36] listening to the word and at the end.
[1:04:40] These people that came for the first
[1:04:42] time,
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:44] they were completely delivered from
[1:04:46] their sicknesses
[1:04:48] and the grave sicknesses.
[1:04:53] They uh uh give testimonies later on
[1:04:58] that the atmosphere that I found in the
[1:05:00] church,
[1:05:02] I felt I was in heaven.
[1:05:10] We can bring heaven down on earth if we
[1:05:13] realize that God is here and heaven is
[1:05:15] here.
[1:05:17] You know my friends,
[1:05:21] if President Trump is sitting here,
[1:05:26] you will have a certain behavior
[1:05:30] because the head of state is here.
[1:05:33] Is that true? True.
[1:05:41] There's certain uh behavior, there's a
[1:05:43] certain attitude that you cannot uh uh
[1:05:46] show forth when the head of state is
[1:05:48] sitting there
[1:05:50] because he's an honorable man,
[1:05:52] respected.
[1:05:54] But here
[1:05:56] we have the Lord of Lord.
[1:06:04] Sometimes we do gestures that makes us
[1:06:07] look like we are in the theater.
[1:06:11] God is sacred.
[1:06:15] I I continue to read.
[1:06:19] If you noticed at the coming of the
[1:06:21] Lord,
[1:06:23] those that had received him,
[1:06:26] it was Simeon
[1:06:29] that nobody had heard talked about.
[1:06:33] But but he who was waiting for the for
[1:06:37] the coming of the Lord,
[1:06:39] the the the the the widow woman Anna
[1:06:44] in the temple.
[1:06:46] Uh
[1:06:46] John the Baptist in the wilderness.
[1:06:51] John went in the wilderness at 9 years
[1:06:53] old.
[1:06:56] Never appeared again till he was uh 30
[1:07:01] in the wilderness.
[1:07:06] and men like that who uh uh secretly
[1:07:09] believed
[1:07:11] and kept humble.
[1:07:14] They was looking for the coming of the
[1:07:16] Lord
[1:07:20] and they never uh uh did blow uh their
[1:07:24] meeting up and have to put on the great
[1:07:27] signs.
[1:07:29] Oh,
[1:07:30] make put great signs.
[1:07:33] the hour, the time
[1:07:36] and and the telecast and everything.
[1:07:42] That's all right for those who wants to
[1:07:44] do it that way.
[1:07:46] But for but me
[1:07:48] that doesn't seem Christlike.
[1:07:51] Do you believe the prophet?
[1:07:57] As for me,
[1:07:59] it doesn't look Christlike. perspective
[1:08:02] in the message uh expectation
[1:08:05] the prophet says
[1:08:07] now
[1:08:10] we don't want to say
[1:08:16] a true and and real uh revival
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:24] is not announced in the great titles and
[1:08:27] in in newspapers and those kind of
[1:08:29] things. No, no, no,
[1:08:30] no.
[1:08:35] There was one thing that lack in the
[1:08:37] life of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:40] I don't like to say that,
[1:08:43] but it was that
[1:08:46] there was missing something to in the
[1:08:49] life of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:53] uh a sense uh of uh uh um trying to
[1:08:59] uh
[1:09:01] um help him or what?
[1:09:06] Uh huh.
[1:09:09] No. Uh like blow things up to show forth
[1:09:12] something.
[1:09:15] He was not a spectacle man.
[1:09:19] Today
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:26] everybody have wants they have a big
[1:09:28] title in the in in the newspaper so they
[1:09:31] can uh talk about what they are doing.
[1:09:35] It's pretentious those things.
[1:09:39] It's not a true servant of Christ.
[1:09:43] A true servant of Christ is humble.
[1:09:46] He's he holds himself back.
[1:09:49] You believe the prophet,
[1:09:52] he holds himself back.
[1:09:55] When a revival starts,
[1:09:58] look what always happens.
[1:10:01] When that happens in the time of in the
[1:10:03] day of Jesus,
[1:10:05] there was just a minority,
[1:10:08] just a few people.
[1:10:12] Look what John had out there on the
[1:10:14] bench.
[1:10:16] just few people gathered around
[1:10:20] from the region around to hear him.
[1:10:28] About uh uh 99% of them rejected his
[1:10:31] message and walked away. Yet
[1:10:36] it was a great revival
[1:10:40] and time. Yeah.
[1:10:43] Thank you.
[1:10:45] a shaking time.
[1:10:49] God shakes things.
[1:10:52] And I believe
[1:10:54] that tonight
[1:10:58] it could be a little shaking.
[1:11:04] God shakes things.
[1:11:07] He shakes things
[1:11:12] and people don't realize
[1:11:14] uh it's it's being done.
[1:11:17] You see,
[1:11:19] God shakes his church.
[1:11:23] The the revival is to his church.
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] The church that's in the church.
[1:11:33] You you following me?
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:37] It's for the church, the revival.
[1:11:41] And the church is what's being shaken,
[1:11:44] not everybody.
[1:11:49] I believe the church is called out now.
[1:11:54] But the thing to do to revive to revive
[1:11:58] is to revive and shake that church
[1:12:03] to its place again.
[1:12:06] and its place.
[1:12:09] It's to identify itself with Christ,
[1:12:13] not to follow the world like we see.
[1:12:20] Today, the church is seduced by the
[1:12:22] world.
[1:12:26] They do things like the world does it
[1:12:28] with a lot of noise.
[1:12:33] They worship the living God like the
[1:12:36] world adors him.
[1:12:40] They do things so they can be seen of
[1:12:43] men and not of God.
[1:12:49] You you remember this young man who was
[1:12:51] playing music in front of people.
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:56] The whole the whole crowd was shouting
[1:13:00] and and and clapping for him.
[1:13:03] But that didn't mean anything to him.
[1:13:07] His eyes were focused on the balcony
[1:13:11] where his master was sitting because he
[1:13:14] had to raid him.
[1:13:18] Your your shouting, your acclamation,
[1:13:20] and all of this didn't mean anything to
[1:13:22] him.
[1:13:23] He was looking for a word from the
[1:13:25] master.
[1:13:27] He wanted the master to shake his head.
[1:13:30] That's why we live today.
[1:13:32] When we stand in front of people,
[1:13:35] we want their approval, their
[1:13:38] acclamation.
[1:13:39] So we can say we preach.
[1:13:42] But is the master also saying that
[1:13:51] we are at the end.
[1:13:56] Jesus is coming to look for a word
[1:13:59] bride.
[1:14:02] people that are identified to himself.
[1:14:07] The world does a lot of things
[1:14:10] that attract our attentions,
[1:14:13] but the bride doesn't look at it.
[1:14:18] It looks like a a message church
[1:14:21] and the things that they do all their
[1:14:24] traala
[1:14:26] just so people can clap. Christ Christ
[1:14:29] is not in those things.
[1:14:32] Christ is in the word.
[1:14:39] I I I think my friends,
[1:14:44] we need a true shaking
[1:14:47] so we can get the church out of the
[1:14:49] worldliness
[1:14:53] and the the uh behaviors or habits that
[1:14:56] makes people popular.
[1:15:01] The message didn't come to make
[1:15:03] preachers popular. No.
[1:15:05] No.
[1:15:08] God placed us.
[1:15:12] So we can attract people to Christ, to
[1:15:14] him, not us.
[1:15:18] We are passengers.
[1:15:19] Amen.
[1:15:24] It's a time of shaking.
[1:15:28] A time to come out of distraction.
[1:15:31] The images of Christ.
[1:15:33] Paragraph 71.
[1:15:37] Now remember this.
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:45] It's only the people that are sick.
[1:15:47] They're the ones that need the attention
[1:15:50] and service and service.
[1:15:56] They looking for attention and service.
[1:16:02] It's the the It's the sick that demands
[1:16:05] attention service.
[1:16:09] When you see a preacher,
[1:16:15] may I not limit it to a preacher,
[1:16:22] but may I limit it to every church
[1:16:25] member that wants attention?
[1:16:30] Who says
[1:16:32] from somebody, me,
[1:16:35] just remember
[1:16:40] There is there is a person a a spiritual
[1:16:43] sick person.
[1:16:46] They are needing attention.
[1:16:56] They need the attention of the spirit of
[1:16:58] God to give them something
[1:17:02] that will take that attitude out of
[1:17:05] them.
[1:17:07] and heal them from their selfishness
[1:17:12] and big ideas
[1:17:16] and big me and little you.
[1:17:21] The Holy Ghost makes us all the same.
[1:17:29] He makes us all the same.
[1:17:34] I like to see at the end of the church
[1:17:36] service,
[1:17:42] oh my dear brother,
[1:17:45] you see people that are looking at each
[1:17:47] other like that
[1:17:49] and they looking for who to shake hands.
[1:17:51] That's not the church of God.
[1:17:55] We are all the same.
[1:18:04] The Holy Ghost makes us all the same.
[1:18:09] Too much spiritual sickness anemic.
[1:18:15] You know what anemia is?
[1:18:18] If somebody is somebody hasn't got
[1:18:21] enough blood, any blood,
[1:18:23] they walk funny.
[1:18:28] They are topsy tipsy topsy
[1:18:36] all the time. That's what's the matter
[1:18:39] with many of our church members today.
[1:18:42] They are anemic.
[1:18:46] They need a blood transfusion of
[1:18:48] Calvary.
[1:18:51] I give them rich royal blood.
[1:18:57] to make them walk in the old-fashioned
[1:19:01] Holy Ghost
[1:19:03] hued out way heed out way of God.
[1:19:08] That'll give them something to live for.
[1:19:15] Give them a confidence that'll make them
[1:19:18] walk in the image of their Lord.
[1:19:23] for my for my side as for myself
[1:19:29] for for my side. Brother said,
[1:19:33] "If I had a choice to make,
[1:19:37] I want to be like he was.
[1:19:42] He came to be a shepherd
[1:19:45] and he was a shepherd.
[1:19:47] A shepherd
[1:19:50] is one who goes after his sheep.
[1:19:54] My dear friends,
[1:19:58] without insisting so much on the word
[1:20:00] identification,
[1:20:03] I believe
[1:20:07] that in a a very simple way but very
[1:20:09] clear way.
[1:20:12] I showed you our identification
[1:20:18] and we are happy to be uh communing
[1:20:20] together tonight here.
[1:20:23] and to know that our identification is
[1:20:25] up on high
[1:20:28] and Christ is our model.
[1:20:32] If there's somebody that you follow
[1:20:33] after, follow after Christ.
[1:20:36] Don't follow after man.
[1:20:41] And our life constitute our
[1:20:44] identification.
[1:20:46] That's our identification.
[1:20:52] If I don't do the works of my father,
[1:20:56] then don't believe me.
[1:21:01] Here are the signs that follows them
[1:21:03] that believe.
[1:21:05] Do you believe that?
[1:21:07] That's our identification.
[1:21:11] I give you power
[1:21:14] to walk on on on serpent on the
[1:21:17] scorpions
[1:21:19] and all the power of the enemy
[1:21:22] and nothing will harm you.
[1:21:25] Do you believe that
[1:21:28] he gave you that power?
[1:21:29] That's right.
[1:21:32] He knew
[1:21:35] that will will walk in the midst of
[1:21:37] serpents
[1:21:39] in the midst of
[1:21:41] but he he assured us
[1:21:44] nothing will harm you.
[1:21:47] Let's hold there.
[1:21:51] Don't let's not complain.
[1:21:54] Oh,
[1:21:56] this scorpion's home. Where am I going
[1:21:57] to walk?
[1:21:59] He he he let us know in advance
[1:22:02] that we have the power to walk on those
[1:22:04] things.
[1:22:06] They can bite us, but they're not going
[1:22:09] to do anything.
[1:22:10] The B is not going to do anything to
[1:22:12] you. The Lord said, "I give you power
[1:22:17] and nothing will harm you."
[1:22:24] Friends, Christian friends
[1:22:28] I believe we only have one book here and
[1:22:30] that's the Bible.
[1:22:34] We only have one creed and that's
[1:22:35] Christ.
[1:22:38] Not this or that that over there.
[1:22:41] We only know Christ.
[1:22:44] We only have we have no love but love.
[1:22:49] And God loves all men.
[1:22:54] He's calling upon all to believe upon
[1:22:56] his son King
[1:22:59] who gave his life for all of them.
[1:23:03] He took our place.
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:08] He took our sins and our iniquity.
[1:23:12] He He accepted it
[1:23:15] just to believe that
[1:23:17] and they have you will have life.
[1:23:20] Don't fight.
[1:23:22] You are not good.
[1:23:24] You will never be good.
[1:23:28] That said the prophet,
[1:23:30] but he took your place
[1:23:34] and God looks at him and not you.
[1:23:39] He took your place
[1:23:43] and everybody is welcome here.
[1:23:50] Regardless of your belief,
[1:23:53] you are welcome here.
[1:23:55] They don't ask you anything.
[1:23:58] Just believe what he did for you.
[1:24:03] Everything that you were, he forgot
[1:24:05] about it.
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:08] Come and follow me. That's what he's
[1:24:10] asking.
[1:24:12] Then here
[1:24:16] we are forming the great economy of God
[1:24:21] without distinction
[1:24:23] of race or social class.
[1:24:28] God receives you as you are.
[1:24:33] receive his word
[1:24:36] and he's going to identify you to
[1:24:38] himself.
[1:24:40] Let's bow our heads.
[1:24:46] Tender heavenly father,
[1:24:51] these few words that are put together,
[1:24:55] you can fix them all together
[1:24:59] that each one of us
[1:25:03] that it may aspire to be like you.
[1:25:08] There's nothing in this world that could
[1:25:09] be compared to your love.
[1:25:13] You loved us no matter regardless of
[1:25:16] what we were
[1:25:18] even regardless of our rebellion.
[1:25:21] You loved us.
[1:25:24] You transformed us by your word.
[1:25:28] We want now
[1:25:30] live like your slaves that our lives not
[1:25:34] what we are talking about but our lives
[1:25:38] be our identification.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah.
[1:25:40] Hallelujah.
[1:25:42] Bless my brother.
[1:25:44] Bless my sister.
[1:25:46] Bless our pastor.
[1:25:49] Give him more strength
[1:25:52] and and fulfill. Give him
[1:25:55] bless all that work with him. those that
[1:25:58] work in unity,
[1:26:00] may our glory come back to you.
[1:26:02] Hallelujah.
[1:26:03] Hallelujah.
[1:26:04] In the name of Jesus Christ. If they are
[1:26:06] sick, if there are those
[1:26:10] that that believe this is the truth, oh
[1:26:12] great Jehovah,
[1:26:14] you Jehovah Rafa, you Jehovah Gyra,
[1:26:19] may you extend your hand.
[1:26:22] May you upon all
[1:26:25] that they may have a testimony,
[1:26:27] a testimony for your hallelujah.
[1:26:31] Bless them all, Lord.
[1:26:33] In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:44] Hallelujah.
[1:26:46] Amen. If the musicians could come. My
[1:26:49] what a word. Aren't you thankful for the
[1:26:50] word? Amen. Why don't we all just go
[1:26:52] ahead and stand?
[1:26:54] Amen. as the musicians come. I just I
[1:26:57] love the word of God and how
[1:27:01] he he he shows there in the very
[1:27:03] beginning that God never made two the
[1:27:05] same,
[1:27:07] that it's not about trying to be
[1:27:08] something that you're not and
[1:27:09] impersonating.
[1:27:11] And then and then the word comes right
[1:27:13] behind it and says we're all the same.
[1:27:18] And what's so amazing about that is when
[1:27:20] you're you you somebody might think,
[1:27:22] wait, that contradicts itself. No, cuz
[1:27:25] he was talking about a blood
[1:27:26] transfusion.
[1:27:28] And my that's that's when it takes it
[1:27:30] takes away your efforts and your ability
[1:27:33] to try to be like this brother and try
[1:27:34] to be like that guy and oh oh that one
[1:27:37] screamed and that one shout well then
[1:27:38] maybe that's that's what that's what I
[1:27:40] got to be doing or or maybe this one
[1:27:42] does that and maybe that's and you're
[1:27:44] always trying to manufacture something
[1:27:46] that somebody else is doing. when when
[1:27:49] you come and you're born again.
[1:27:51] I I had that I you know what I just
[1:27:54] maybe they could just start playing um
[1:27:57] something softly because I I on my heart
[1:27:59] I just I didn't want to let this pass um
[1:28:01] the opportunity of how the word come
[1:28:03] forth in such a way um to to minister to
[1:28:08] somebody's heart, you know, that it's
[1:28:09] not something that you're going to
[1:28:10] muster up. It's not something that
[1:28:12] you're going to achieve by your efforts
[1:28:14] and in trying to manufacture and
[1:28:16] impersonate this individual or that
[1:28:18] individual. But really what it takes is
[1:28:21] a it takes a blood transfusion where you
[1:28:24] are identified with the sacrifice.
[1:28:27] And that's where that sacrifice that was
[1:28:29] laid down on Calvary, Jesus paid the
[1:28:31] price that the life that was in the
[1:28:34] blood could come back upon the believer.
[1:28:38] And that would be the trans blood
[1:28:40] transfusion that makes us all the same.
[1:28:43] And and that that oneness or that
[1:28:45] sameness I isn't isn't we're all robots,
[1:28:48] but it's every person fitly joined to
[1:28:51] the body of God. That big beautiful
[1:28:54] bouquet of God where one one manifest
[1:28:56] the attributes in God this way and one
[1:28:59] manufactures it and one manifest it is
[1:29:02] the word I'm looking for in this way.
[1:29:04] And I was thinking about it and I
[1:29:06] thought, you know what that is? That's a
[1:29:07] surrender.
[1:29:08] Not a manufacturing, but a surrender.
[1:29:11] And I just thought maybe as we had the
[1:29:13] opportunity and the as the word went
[1:29:14] forth so beautifully and and hey, some
[1:29:18] of it a a correction and a a rebuke and
[1:29:21] but you know, the word those I love, I I
[1:29:23] I chasen, I rebuke. Isn't that good that
[1:29:26] Lord, it's not something that I'm
[1:29:27] manufacturing. It's not something that
[1:29:29] I'm working up and and putting together
[1:29:31] and trying to be like this or that. But
[1:29:32] Lord, it it's in humility and and
[1:29:34] reverence and your presence that I'm I'm
[1:29:37] surrendering and saying, "Lord, I want
[1:29:38] to be more like you. Lord, make me more
[1:29:41] like you, Lord Jesus." Not something
[1:29:42] that I can do, but I just thought I'd
[1:29:45] give the opportunity to to anybody
[1:29:47] that's here that you'd just say, "Lord,
[1:29:50] I I I want to maybe with every head
[1:29:52] bowed that Lord, I want to I want to
[1:29:55] humble myself to the word of God."
[1:29:58] Lord, I want to be more reverent and
[1:29:59] more sincere. And
[1:30:02] Lord, I seen such a great example in the
[1:30:04] prophet who
[1:30:06] was so humble and didn't make a
[1:30:10] spectacle and didn't lift himself up,
[1:30:13] but always pointed to Christ and had the
[1:30:15] ability to to humble himself and make
[1:30:18] himself a servant to man. Is that your
[1:30:21] heart's desire? You just want to be able
[1:30:23] to humble yourself to the Lord and be
[1:30:25] more like Jesus Christ. And as this word
[1:30:28] went forth, our identification is the
[1:30:31] word. Not something that we can do, not
[1:30:33] something that we can work up,
[1:30:36] but it's a by a blood transfusion. And I
[1:30:39] want to give somebody the opportunity
[1:30:40] here. Maybe you haven't had that blood
[1:30:42] transfusion
[1:30:44] and you haven't come into that
[1:30:46] identification of the sacrifice. Is
[1:30:48] there somebody that would want to lift
[1:30:50] their hand and say, "I I want to be born

[1:31:05] before him? Heavenly Father, Lord, your
[1:31:07] word has gone forth. And we thank you
[1:31:10] for your word. And Lord, we want to be
[1:31:12] identified with you and your word in
[1:31:14] this end time, Lord. not not in
[1:31:18] identified in man or identified in
[1:31:20] something that we can do that would
[1:31:21] bring attention to ourselves, Lord, but
[1:31:23] we want to be we want our identification
[1:31:25] to be in your word with that reverence
[1:31:27] and that humility and that meekness,

[1:31:32] spirit, Lord, that when people look at
[1:31:34] our lives, Lord, they would that it
[1:31:36] would cause them to hunger and thirst
[1:31:38] for something that we have, not in some
[1:31:41] big show, but Lord, just in the the
[1:31:44] fruits of Christ and the humility and
[1:31:46] the meekness, Lord, of your spirit.

[1:31:52] Lord, that would want that blood
[1:31:53] transfusion and they want that life and

[1:32:08] of your blood, Lord. That we could have
[1:32:10] a blood transfusion, Lord, that would
[1:32:12] change our nature and make us a new
[1:32:14] creature in Jesus Christ. That we could
[1:32:17] be born again, Lord, and all made the
[1:32:19] same in the blood of Jesus Christ. What

[1:32:24] us in this time that we're now living.

[1:32:28] you for this opportunity. We commit

[1:37:47] Heavenly Father, we're very conscious of
[1:37:49] you here, Lord, and that you've drawn
[1:37:52] nigh. And I believe you're breathing out
[1:37:55] over your children, Father.
[1:37:59] Lord, and it's in this atmosphere that
[1:38:01] lives are changed. And Lord, your word
[1:38:04] is quickened and made a reality.
[1:38:07] Father, I want to thank you for that.
[1:38:10] Thank you for being mindful of your
[1:38:12] children.
[1:38:15] Lord, you're worthy.
[1:38:17] Yes,
[1:38:18] Lord. You deserve the first place, the

[1:38:25] shown us.
[1:38:27] Lord, that when we look outward towards
[1:38:29] the needs of others, then
[1:38:31] Yes.
[1:38:31] then things can change.
[1:38:33] Yes.
[1:38:33] Lord, your prophet taught us
[1:38:35] Christianity in such simplicity.
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] Lord, our heart's condition
[1:38:43] should be to live for others.
[1:38:46] Lord, even now in this moment, those
[1:38:47] hands that were raised to know you.
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:39:02] It's the greatest privilege I've ever
[1:39:04] known, oh God, is to know you.
[1:39:07] Thank you, Jesus,
[1:39:10] Lord. I want a birthing floor, oh God. I
[1:39:13] want a place where people come to know
[1:39:14] you when they come into this house, oh
[1:39:16] God, to know the reality of you, oh God.
[1:39:19] And Lord, I don't want to hold anything
[1:39:21] back that would prevent that from
[1:39:23] happening, Lord.
[1:39:24] Yes, Lord.
[1:39:25] I don't want to be too proud, Lord. And
[1:39:29] oh God, as a church, I believe every
[1:39:32] single one of us wants to see whoever
[1:39:35] raised their hand come to know you,
[1:39:37] Lord.
[1:39:37] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:39:39] Lord, your word has come forth.
[1:39:42] Lord, it's been the truth. It's
[1:39:44] absolutely nothing but the truth.
[1:39:47] Lord, where your word is, your Holy
[1:39:49] Spirit's there to brood out over it and
[1:39:50] to bring it to pass. And Lord, in all
[1:39:53] this, we just could stand back and say
[1:39:55] you're worthy of it all, Father.
[1:39:57] Lord, it's nothing man can do, but
[1:39:59] you're the giver of life.
[1:40:01] You're the quickener. You're the keeper
[1:40:03] of the covenant, Father. You gave the
[1:40:05] promise. You drew the heart. You You
[1:40:07] caused him to raise the hand, Father.
[1:40:09] and you're here to confirm yourself to
[1:40:11] be the same yesterday, today, and
[1:40:13] forever. So, we commit it to you, Lord
[1:40:15] Jesus, as we'd go our separate ways, the
[1:40:17] many that would be traveling. And Lord,
[1:40:19] our pastor as he's traveling back still,
[1:40:21] Father, be with him. And Lord, you know
[1:40:23] the needs that are represented, Lord, we
[1:40:25] just commit it all to you. In the mighty
[1:40:27] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:40:32] and mercy
[1:40:36] ruled
[1:40:38] my life. Amen. You are dismissed.
