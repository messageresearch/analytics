Description:
The Law of Reproduction
Br. Raphael Kabeya
January 22, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Lord that your mind would be in US Lord that you could reveal yourself to us in a supernatural way Lord we just commit each need to you each individual that's come Lord we're here with burdens upon our heart and needs in our body needs in our spirit we hold loved ones on our heart and we're laying it all down at your feet this morning knowing that you're the same yesterday today and forever and that you can do all things Lord so we just invite you now to come take control from the beginning to the ending of the service Lord may you anoint our brother Raphael in a supernatural way I know in brother Billy Lord that there would be one voice to your people and we'd be able to look past the Veil and see you Lord speaking to us anoint our ears that we might hear from you commit all things to you now we ask in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord we'll just ask brother Mike you can be seated and then at the reading of the word we can stand I don't know if as you are walking up if you saw that we we have the forms put up for the slab to tell you what where I'm getting excited as you as you come to the church on Wednesdays and Sundays you're we start to see the slab and the forms being put up so soon and very soon I'd rather for a Rapture but if the Lord tarries but it's going to take all of us together so I know that if you have time on the weekends there's always some cleaning up or some rake or shovel work that could be done it's going to take us as a body so we're just really excited about what God is doing amen morning God bless you know we're going to just keep reading in Psalm 103 this or 105 this morning there was there's a bigger chapter and you know I've just been reading through it and just seems to be full of so many little nuggets at least for me you know we were looking kind of last time at how you know it was a kind of a call to God's people to kind of remember refocus on who they were what they were about as a people you know that uh in an hour when the word and the presence of the Lord had been re-established in their midst you know it was you know a time to come together and just remember to resolve you know we were looking at that last time how at the beginning of each year people set resolutions to get things done within a certain period of time setting time restrictions or time frames of when they're going to complete a task or when they're going to see something done and we were just looking at that maybe how the world works that may be a measure that the world uses but that's not a measure that God uses he isn't a being of time it's all about his word that's his measuring stick and as the people of the word you know how our measuring sticks should be the same it's his word you know and we were just looking at that and there was a statement that David made in Psalm 19 or Psalm 105 19 verse 19 that caught my attention and he said this until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him you know and kind of along those lines the margin in my Bible kind of has it in parentheses this way it says until the time that his word came to pass the word of the Lord tested him you know we're just going to read a small portion of this chapter this morning but you know starting in verse 16 there's just these few verses that talk about the story of Joseph you know we know the story well and you know often brother Branham would draw parallels between the life of Joseph in the life of Jesus you know the path that God had one walk was sort of bearing record to the path that the other would walk now Joseph was a young man who God spoke to concerning himself he got thus saith the Lord that one day he'd be in a position of authority that he would be a leader that he would be a ruler that his own brothers would bow down to him and yet you know his brothers as we know sold him into slavery in Egypt and set Joseph on a journey when he found himself in circumstances he found himself in a condition that was exactly the opposite of what the word had said concerning him couldn't be further removed from the position of authority than being in the bottom of a jail cell in Chains there was a period of time where thus saith the Lord had spoken one thing but the condition he found himself in said something entirely different the word that he had been given was now being used to test him you know and that that tells us a little bit about the timeline of God how God's measuring stick works you know he speaks a word we believe in that word and then there becomes this period of time where we're tested by that same word before that word comes to pass or is manifest in our lives you know there's a word that might be spoken concerning our circumstance or our condition or what we what he sees for us in the word and then we look at our condition and it's exactly the opposite until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him you know there's every single person on Earth whether they're Believers or not go through hard times whether it's financial trouble whether it's family trouble whether it's sickness whether it's mental trouble everybody has the same challenges but you know the unique thing about the people of God is as they have to look at their experience or their condition and compare that with what the word said about them and that's a different level of trial you know the test is not necessarily the hardship we go through the test is the fact that it is absolutely contradictory to what the word says about us until the time that the word came the word of the Lord Tried Him you know it says in verse 17 of Psalm 105 he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with Fetters he was laid in iron and similarly speaking of Jesus in Philip Philippians chapter 2 and verse 7 it says but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross you know earlier in that very chapter it speaks of Jesus being in the form of God who thought himself not robbery to be equal with God you know and there was all kinds of word all kinds of promises and scriptures that spoke of him being a king that spoke of him sitting on the throne of David and yet in spite of that word the condition that he found himself in was that of a servant was that of one who had the reputation of being an illegitimate man from a little town called Nazareth the word said one thing what was manifest was something else at least at the time and he too as it says in Hebrews is tempted in all points like as we are having to walk a path that seems to contradict what the word has said about him you know we know says in James my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith out of your body out of your finances not of your mind but your faith that peace which is thus saith the Lord because Faith cometh by hearing blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the Crown of Life the timeline of God until the time that the word came the word of the Lord tested him we know how the story of Joseph ended we could we're going to read it here in a second in verse 20 the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princess at his pleasure and teach his Senators wisdom and then it says of Jesus in Philippians 2 wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name wherefore at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in the earth and things under the Earth you know as he went through that testing time where his condition was contrary to the word the devil tested him with that same thing if you bow to me I'll give you all the kingdoms of the Earth but when he waited for the manifestation of the the word of the Lord not only did he have the kingdoms of the earth that the ones in heaven and the ones beneath the Earth as well you know being tried by the very word of our faith the timeline of God but you know when all the evidences to the contrary it doesn't change anything about what thus saith the Lord has said concerning us whatever that may be you know and it just kind of spoke to me this morning especially when you think about the timeline of God not being one of dates or hours or how humans measure progress but it's about that space of time where the very word he's giving you he's testing Us by and then one day it will come to pass and it's just an encouragement there that Joseph saw his word fulfilled Jesus saw that word made manifest and and that's the case for each one of us here this morning so to me I thought that was just an interesting reminder of the timeline of God and hopefully an encouragement you know a reminder to refocus we want to go ahead and stand it's we're going to just read just a few verses here of Psalm 105. we're going to read starting in verse 16 and read to verse 22. I'll just read that together moreover he called for a famine upon the land he break the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with Fetters he was laid in Iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teaches Senators wisdom amen and praise the Lord you may be seated I want to sing that song and let the worshipers arise I believe we sing in the key of f and I'm glad there's a people that can worship Him in spirit and in truth man let's just sing this father I see that you were drawing a Line in the Sand and I wanna be

we're ashamed of our mistakes we're ashamed of how easily we get distracted [Music] and are LED Away by vain things but we've come this morning Father to hear from you that Lord you draw us back closer to you you'd pull us back as we heard Wednesday night you're coming to get us and we're grateful for that we ask you to bless us this morning in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen you may see it just for a moment just say a few things and then we'll sing Amazing Grace before first of all I I really come to appreciate the musicians I just got to thinking when we were singing all those songs after writing a roll the musicians they just have to stay right with it you know and I thought that to me that's marvelous amen amen uh as Matthew made mention uh you can see the Forum boards have been set up and that kind of give you an idea of the size of the church and the walkways so we'll have a lot of empty space um in our new church when we come in it but uh we're going to have to warm it up with our spirits amen and with our attitude and with our Grace you know I got to thinking of the uh you know the power of one and um so you know we're starting to build so I do want uh to say that we have a couple boxes out there I think we have an offering box and a tithing box up uh and so if you have a suggestion of what you'd like to see in the church or anything that you have an idea that you would like to uh recommend just feel free to write it on there I mean if you want extra padding on the pews just write extra padding just write whatever that you would like to uh put in so we can know what you're thinking consider your thoughts um and uh don't if you don't see those thoughts uh manifested in any way I I do want you to know they were considered and um so anyway for that what it is also we we want to address a uh special need of the family has a need a sister Grace has died in Congo the mother of the family and so if any of you would like to help with their funeral expenses there um please see brother Billy uh and uh give to him any offering that you feel that you might want to give to help every little bit helps you know 5 10 whatever the Lord would put on your heart if you would get brother brother Billy after church you'll be kind of in the front then you can just uh place it in that well that worked really good amen God bless you I was thinking again like I was saying about the power of one and we know we have one God don't we one Lord and savior we have one way you know we have one mediator between God and man one Spirit by with we're all baptized and if we read in Ephesians uh four it says uh this it says he's talking here in Ephesians 4 he says endeavoring this is the third verse he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God father of us all and one brother who showed up to help on Saturday and as above all and through all and in you all amen the power of one huh okay amen I really like that scripture hey man you got to read into the scripture sometimes you got to read between the lines in order to get what's coming out amen so we just thought we'd reach out to you through the word of God and so we can Endeavor to keep the unity of the faith and and that we can go forward because it's certainly going to take us all so there's always something to do no matter how weak or how strong uh you know I used to think the rain was excuse and then I got called to preach one time in canis in Oh Canada and it was like 17 below zero and the wind was blowing and the snow was going I looked out the window and I thought praise God I don't have to preach this morning nobody's going to go to church in this Bang Bang Bang on the door for 20 minutes we're leaving brother McGarry so I had to get back in the spirit real quick and get out of bed and uh and so I got out there and you know and the wind's blowing and you know I'm from Texas and everybody came to church the place was packed out with a full-blown blizzard going and and I always thought well you know well these people are used to it and then something else spoke in my heart and he said you know these people are going to rise up in judgment against the days that people who have had it better have missed just like that little widow woman's been a rise up in the day of judgment because she gave of what she had so don't forget being giving don't forget it's going to take an effort don't forget it's going to take a sacrifice no matter how little you think your sacrifice is too Littles make a great and together we can be great don't you believe that amen and just think of how he stuck with you so if I just think this is a great opportunity for us all to come together and accomplish something and before we turn the service over I we were working the other day and we have a neighbor that lives right behind us and you've seen his truck out here parked in the lot he does a a lot of free hauling for us and and um and you know he enjoys doing he's really been a blessing to us the other day he was helping us clean the parking lot shoveling dirt out and worked in helping brother John and and he stopped and he stood on his shovel and he took his hat off and he looked over at me and I could feel the spirit just fall down and he said you're not building that you're he said you're building this church for people you don't know and uh and and he was moved he said he said people need to know the way and then he looked at me and I I I understood his Hispanic brother and their respect for the elders he says there's not many people your age preaching the gospel the truth anymore and it struck me and he went on to say that how he got saved um and uh it moved but I I it struck my heart because I don't want to build this church for message people you understand that's not my goal to build a church for people who have already heard the message you know what I mean and they want to come join a fellowship and you know I want to build it for those who haven't heard I want to build it for your converts your converts the people that you're gonna come in contact that you want to have a place for them to Fellowship we're we're never going to be a church of great enticing words as we don't come with great enticing words but may we come with the power and the demonstration of the holy spirit that the people might know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that they might know that the spirit that they feel and sense can dwell in them and and that's uh that that's the beauty and even as it says and this is the end of that scripture that I love as we stand together and prepare for our brother Raphael who's going to be returning home soon it's been a blessing for him to be here and uh he kind of took a sabbatical uh from his work at home and uh and uh I might take example of that is but it says in the sixth verse it says one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen that's what we want to bring to the world a God that can dwell in us and can do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think we'll be ministering this evening so Lord richly bless you let's see amazing guest as our friend and our brother brother Raphael kabea from brazzer reveal comes and brings the word of the Lord to us that's been on his heart this morning amen let's sing it together Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen for a moment this is my last Sunday after a long stay is I think Pastor for his goodness and I thank all the people for the welcoming spirit Mercy my wife and I are sincerely thanking you um for the hospitality that we received from many of you is invited places to come and to come and commune and eat now it's time to go home uh because the ones that are home are waiting for us alone and let's all stand to read the word Genesis Genesis chapter 1 verse 24. anymore and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creatures after its kind cattle creeping things beast of the earth after his kind and it was so a table and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the Carol after the kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good we do the phase is and God said let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created men in his own image in the image of God created the him male and female created heat them your seats I started the subject last time that I was not able to finish that I didn't even start hello uh told me a while ago to make sure that I finished my subject my subject is the law of reproduction we see we're gonna see how this law is functioning [Music] we know that every life on Earth comes from us a germ we know that all of us sitting here we come from a germ of life say you just entered it's a very small germ that you cannot even see with the naked eye and we know as every one of us we come from our father the the spoken word says that we don't have any blood from our mothers because they sell of of of of blood comes from the male and that's what I can say this morning we all come from God our true father everything that we have come from our heavenly father who's the true male you understand that the woman doesn't give anything to literal to the child all comes from them the blood comes from the father and see and then everything comes from our heavenly father if and it's from that small cell that we cannot see with AI this is the cells that are multiplying around that one cell and everything reproduce itself according to his own kind the dog's germ will produce a dog a bird germ will produce a bird a human germ will produce a human if nothing comes into to to break away the program of God every seed has to bring forth according to his own kind of maturity and the product will be normal to grow to its maturity the message of malachite 4 that has gathered us here it's the spoken word that brought the world into existence in the beginning in Genesis it's the spoken word that brought the world into existence in in other words the alpha has become the Omega so it's only possible it was the thinking that was in the mind of God in the beginning when we receive them we have eternal life we have been recreated by the preaching of the word that's why our pastor here insists often times that it may be the spoken word that's been brought forth here because life is only in the spoken word are thinking our opinions and all those things they're good things but life is only in the spoken word now we don't have to belong to a church you didn't come to belong to the church and you have come to hear the word and be birth of the word because the word that's the Original Seed so this is how God brings forth his children download in the soul in the in the souls in the uh the the womb of their soul by the spoken word The Life of Christ foreign word it was not brought forth according to a certain theology or a certain model who the police it's this word that have caused others to become the imitators with once I can come and copy from it is a this word comes directly from God and it was not some thinking that came from somebody else somewhere this message is the original when you hear it it's different from everything else we've heard from churches you hear sometimes people say well it's the same word that's been preached to other churches this message is regardless of what church you came from when you hear this message is different from everything else we've been exposed and that's why because before you Satan has in front of him Christ in a man the message can never be conquered it can never be falsified because the message is God himself the churches can be falsified they can receive wrong things but the message can never be false I hope I don't know if I'm making myself understood that's why whoever receives the message correctly no one can seduce him no Doctrine can take and move him over because the message is God himself we are at the end we're going back to the original the spoken word that was in the beginning look foreign it will tie it will bring forth the sons and the daughters of God so the world can see God in human flesh to see God in the human flesh it's only given to men and women who will only receive the message alone we live in the end time in the age of loud this year it's the world most darkest age of all the ages it's the the most hypocrite age that there is with no light it's a time where there is a lot of deceited but God has promised a message or a messenger in this time of confusion at the evening time foreign to received the same thing that that you have like listening the church is not supposed to be surprised by the new things when you hear new things you ask malachite foreign the Full Gospel of Salvation justifications sanctification has to rest only upon what God has said in in giving a definition of what Allah [Music] it will produce itself according to the original according to his own kind there's there's no uh uh trouble in there the seed of a bird will produce a bird the seed of a man will produce a human being when you mix it you get something that's that looks good but it's it's weak and it does it's the mixing of a horse and uh then a donkey it cannot produce itself he doesn't know his father or his mother it's the same with a Believer or rest himself upon malachite 4. a Believer who's only an admirer of preachers without knowing where that word comes from he doesn't even know who's his spiritual father rest only upon what God has said because all other ground is sinking sand god holds his word he's tied to his word the Heaven and Earth will pass away the word of God will never pass away the doctrines people's tendency they they all go forward and people they they ex they accept them and it makes a lot of noise but after for a while it comes down and when the leader is taken out they are all forgotten but the word just remain with this word now to get into our subject s if every seed has to bring forth after its kind it's written that God created Man In His Image according to his likeness and then we can all believe that a man is of a Divine species man whether of the Divine species it was made it was created to be the word of God on Earth that's why the fall of Man was not the end of man it was the program of God to reveal his attributes to the produce remember because in order for him to reproduce himself God had to become the the the the the a Kingsman Redeemer for man so he could take the place of The Sinner because we know that the the price for sin is death and see you David then God had to give his own life eternal his eternal life so he can bring man in his original place the Son of God with all the attributes of God in him we believe we have all the attributes of God in us the Bible says [Music] so are we in this world that's what we are yes do you believe that glory to God if we are born again of the spirit of God God doesn't have weak Parts in the gross party folks and strong Parts the the weakest part of God is omnipotent no some defensive defeated we are Sons and Daughters of God with all these attributes in Us in the souls that are in prison you are part of God and I'm a part of God but I'm not all God that neither are you all God all of God which God himself became flesh to die for us then we are all amateur Gods everything that God is we are in this world this message is to bring us back in that initial position because you know with me that every man or woman completely surrender to the word is all-powerful we are living outside over there in certain circumstances foreign [Music] set forth his look towards even all the way to the beginning he looked and he saw all the way back to Genesis even a place where he himself was not and Moses says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and we believe that that's the same Prophet because he's a prophet he saw that but when William he begins to tell us clearly what God was before even there was a beginning before Genesis beginning of everything before there was anything the father was a star before there was an Adam God filled up our time in space he was himself dwelling in eternity he was eternity the spoken word says He was the great Fountain of love he was the the the the fountain that never ceases he was all in all foreign [Music] foreign we go back I believe I talked on this a little bit uh the other day oh I struck it in Genesis first chapter 1 verse 26. When God call his name Lord God it's in the word which means the self-existing one existed there was nothing else existed but him [Music] he made that it was a foreign [Music] in him was a nature to be a father male exist but remember but he existed by himself there ain't nothing for him to be a father inside of this is down inside of him there was something else is an object of worship but it was self-existent so there was nothing to worship him in this great Jehovah to be healed so his attributes his nature produced what is today everything that we are today was produced by his nature there's attributes that was in him he continues some people say why didn't God just stop it in the beginning his cruel-hearted so John Lewis the one who condemned Joe or Jacob see he said they know he he there was no such thing just an existing part that it doesn't exist still existed if he existence he was going to be oh he he named them but his names is he called them all kinds of name but he just because he might have a lot of knowledge but he has nothing in here you see that now that's where it is the word tells here he's hidden and these Mysteries has been here remember the Bible says the pillar foreign [Music] can go far if you can allow me to go back Janice Irvin says Genesis 1 and 26 Mercury I'm going to speak on it on Wednesday called you a film when God made a man I found the film before he made a man this word means in Hebrews he exists upon women one that existed by himself all by himself nothing was before him he was the whole existence that ever been it was one that existed by himself the the one who's fulfilled himself in all things he can do office he existed by himself Genesis 2. when he made man he says I am [Music] y a h u g e z uh j u v u h Jehovah Jehovah what does that mean he exists I created something by myself we come from him I created something by myself so I can make it my son your son is a human being if we are sons of God we are Gods to make it myself or one of my little ones temporarily to an amateur one glory to God [Music] it doesn't exist by himself anymore foreign he jumped foreign completely submitted to the will of God which is his word everything will come subject to us is that the scripture if it was his property he was the god of the earth you could pronounce he could speak the word and something will come to pass the prophet said spoke the word and he came to pass we have a great God and ground Duty a great God in for one time I had a I had a lot of money in the bag I was uh um I was doing commissions and and those uh robbers and all those guys they know how to see who's got money on the security they came and they came and they presented themselves as a security agent and Mr followers there were two of them I opened the bag what is this it's money Supreme Society it's for a company they slapped me and when they slapped me I I dropped the bag I put my hands on us I said Lord and they want to take it Lord help me in the name of Jesus in regard they look at me regardless they look at the money close your back Oliver go you see by Perfect [Applause] God is the present help in terms of me he's very wonderful let's go back he can speak the word and something will come to pass written in the book when the lamb was slain before the foundation the one who existed by himself it was like a a big diamonds he could never been anything else but inside of that diamond we have this is attribute there was an attribute for him to be a savior among the attributes inside of him there was an attribute to be a Healer if you are sick that's for you he was there to heal you and because there was nothing to be said nothing to hear Allah and those attributes reduce those things knowing all that was going to come to be manifest that means that it was going to be a savior it was gonna come to be made Flash and to dwell Among Us he knew that by his stripes he slayed there before the foundation [Music] that the true life the real life can only be given to us by by the seed the original seeds to produce Christ the word seed comes by a channel the Ministries are are channels the original word come to pass through and when you receive it is you can only produce the Life of Christ in you the word comes by Channel a member of the Bible for him to get into the church in order to produce the Life of Christ if it's not the case it's a hybrid without life and that's a a bearing God doesn't allow because the myth s it will bring forth death and it will take God away from us in the spoken word is original seedham says now the power of the church that believes do you believe that is the church says amen let's say is in you is that Christ has all the power Matthew 28 and 18. is this is the word seed in his body if it's the word seed he has all the power if that word sin is in you then you have all the power and if it's him and us then it's the word seed in us what is it then everything that God was he poured into Christ and everything that Christ was he was poured into his church that's the that's the power the power is everything that God wants he poured into Christ and everything remember the law of law of reproduction of God now remember according to its kind is that true amen the assembly said amen the seed of Christ the word must come through his body Lassie must decrease the doer that the seed of Christ must be transmitted by his through his body in denomination not by denomination because a denomination reason it will it will bring forth thinking denomination it produces his own thinkings and give it to the church but his body is tied to the world and any seed has to be transmitted through it not by denomination but by by a seed word born again now remember guess [Music] and the body of Christ is made out of set five Ministries it's true that body that the seed is being transmitted through the body is that true the assembly said amen the Church of the Bible Sydney songs this this birthday it means the new birth will produce it itself the the the the new birth produces Christ himself in his body in his church and you see men and women they behave like people from on high it's part of the accommodation they speak like people from they are preoccupying themselves with things that edifies the people it's the word some people can have the confirmation of Hebrew 13 and 8. when the seed is preached properly Christians we will see Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 29. now want you to remember this my Christian Brothers it's by election that you've been predestinated to be son and daughter of God you were elected to be here today God elected you to receive this word and the program of God he followed you everywhere that you were I mean he yanked you out of the hands of Satan you were in place in worse places you had projects to become murderers the one that would smoke weed programs God was following [Applause] [Applause] when me God is humility today you are the proof of his vision that's why he's Whispering a secret of mystery it's the secret of God they are making you what you want a Son of God will only look upon his grace look look the devil is trying by all means every time to try to point you to your first world your first marriage with the world offender to accuse you and to keep you under condemnation the devil is constantly reminding you of your dirty paste but it's him that brought you through seduction into the place then he brought you into those places in your heart you didn't want to do those things you didn't want to do those things you didn't want to go to those places you didn't want to speak uh gross things out of your mouth me but because you were among the the bad people you were you were being led by themselves you did those things regardless of who you were but the first word is speaking to you because you did you in the eyes of God it's like you've never done it in the first place God predestinated you to go through those things like the history of the eagle the eagle didn't choose to be in the chicken club you found himself in the chicken Cooper that's why God has Justified and your old book of War on a certificate marriage is dissolved in existence it doesn't even exist no longer in God's thinking this word if you receive it correctly it brings you in the presence of God where the the uh Aaron's roared in one night there's something and then you are in the presence of God without sin you never sin to begin with glory to God look love from Samaritan the Samaritan woman in the presence of of Christ for me she went out from there transformed she can she could have went back and got and proclaimed that I have met him and people hurt her they couldn't look at her and say you are prostitute what are you doing in the presence of Christ he was transformed in the presence of God this message is your god when you received you come out of here purified that's a presence in his presence you don't need to have weeks and months into the message what you need is to meet Christ if everything is taken care of we don't need a character oh we need 30 days you need some questions to meet Christ that you need before Christ it was death she was waiting for that but in his presence there's no death that's the presence in his presence it's life many of the preachers she didn't even have time to regret the things it was enough to purify her deceived regardless of things [Music] all the union is in the sea of forgetfulness him the bridegroom has taken your your fills on him he literally is the great Observer of the great athletes that swallowed up all of your paths when you got in this is presence your past is all gone taken to zero so yeah be thankful for his grace and living in Joy believe me he took your place he took my place love that I wouldn't be standing here before the foundation of the world he predestinated that so we can belong to him to be part of his right bride lose Moon we had a seal when we were coming into the Earth regardless of where you were going that seal was upon you just go down to some manifestation until the time of it when the word came to meet you and see and then you were not even aware of married to the world to begin with that's what the world of the word of God tells you needed you you are the predestinated seed of God saw you like he seen you when he saw you in before the foundation of the world but that Satan took hold of your Shadow but not you vote foreign foreign let's all stand [Applause] the word is a seed that is sower sword yes is that true and every seed will bring forth after his own kind okay in the beginning was the word it's by him that all things were created and in the end God sent the whole entire world so he can mold sons and daughters so he can manifest once again Christ Hebrew 39. because the Rapture is the world has to see Christ if you want salvation my brother my sister listen to him if you want Mercy listen to him if you want the Holy Ghost listen to the word the message you will not get his own myth now if you want healing now listen to him that if the doctor has told you because I died thank you the the sickness is that you will never be healed listen to what the greatness the great physician says Isaiah 53 the word says but it was bruised for our sins it was well it was a breeze broken for iniquity the chassis of our sin fall upon him and it's by his stripes that we are healed that has to excite every believer to believe in him foreign [Music] [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] foreign just invite that presence around you that's the presence that's going to heal you that's the presence

[Music] praise [Music] if someone was dead come to you and [Music] the rest you are ask you something you would ask their credentials may I see your credentials you want to know that they represent something at their legitimate and you know what your credential is it's the presence of Jehovah that's what your credentials is Satan can't defy that you can't divide the presence when he looked at the sons of sifa they they told them they went to Casper and he says they stopped the moment because you know he says Jesus we know him Paul we know but what's your credentials who are you what gives you the right to stand against me that would be Satan speaking what gives you the right to stand against me what gives you the right to stand against this sickness what gives you the right to stand against this handle what gives you the right the presence not you your righteousness is as a filthy rag you're thinking no matter it just becomes theology without his presence when you can stand there and look at Satan in the face and say you know I am a wretch but you see that great God there he loves me foreign I can't get well by myself [Music] I can't even tell you to move by myself but it's his love for me [Music] it's what he told me so you have no right to me he'll Planet your flesh I'm getting a new one you'll point at your weakness he that is in me is greater than he was in the world that's our light that's the light of the world Christ in you the hope of glory theology doesn't do it it's a Hungry Heart all ye that are heavy laden come unto me and I'll give you rest if you believe that if you believe what he says if you understand that he so loved you that he gave his only begotten son that's what we're trying to say there's a real God that does real things and there's no need worrying about things that don't have anything to do with it the main thing is do I know he loves me do I know that he's for me and if you know you're outside of that you remember you can't work your way in there all you can do is simply say Lord I'm you're not in me the way you should be you don't need to say all your problems I like what our brother said she didn't have time even to confess her sins she didn't have time to lay her whole case out she 'd have time to justify everything that she had done and everything that she had said and everything once she come in contact with them once she opened her heart and he just tenderly spoke to her until she just opened her heart for just that one second and he come in and make things different I know if we had time to share our burdens we'd have a mountain of burdens wouldn't we but One Moment In His presence makes all the difference in the world you don't need a solution you don't need a program you don't need a plan you just need his presence [Music] that's your credential is this presence that's your Authority is his presence that's your deliverance everything that you need he is I think we work too hard [Music] foreign we worked
