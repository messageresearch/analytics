[Music] [Music] I don't fly away [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] don't cry away [Music] [Music] all praise is wonderful name one of these days in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're gonna be changed isn't that exciting bless his wonderful name there's a song that was on my heart I want to sing draw me nearer to the cross it says Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross there a precious Fountain I hope this would be all right time I was just thinking you know we used to have those those song books those only belief song books get a little feedback up here if you can turn the monitor down just a little bit um but you know there's a reason that we sing the songs we sing and if you ever read some of them old books you'd open up and say these songs were sung by Brother Brianna and those I don't know about you but those songs mean a lot to me and you just find them all weaved into the word of God and weaved into people's testimony and I just bear with me but I thought this would bless you because I I think when when you sing a song it needs to Anchor into something you want to identify with it if it's somebody's testimony or somebody received from from the Lord and they sang that song well it can help pull you in into that presence or the meaning of that song and brother Branham he's going to pray for a Georgia Carter I believe he says I went up to the door and opened the door and and there she was laying there poor little thing in her lips quivering her mother startled couldn't finish telling her what had happened like that I walked over there to the bed and put my hands on her I said Georgia even Jesus Christ who gave me the vision of a lamb hung in the wilderness down here somewhere has appeared to me today in the woods and sent me here that I might lay hands upon you that you should be well I took her by the hand and I said as the Lord God has said to me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and be whole and how was she to raise up limbs that big around hadn't moved for nine years and eight months laying on a bed but when God speaks he gives strength that's right taking her by the hand she looked at me like that her eyes looked like they had set I took her by the hand and I raised her from the bed less than a moment's time she was walking through the house she was screaming her mother pitched over in the room cold fainted the girl opened the door and walked out sat on the grass and began to bless the grass she began to bless the leaves bless her little heart the first time she'd seen leaves in the grass for nearly nine years if she had been laid in that bed and the people began to run from the neighborhood everywhere I'd done went outside toward the hills toward the church I couldn't stand around there you know anointing was just blessing all around started up the hill here she run back in the house sat down at the piano a few moments her father came from across the hill where a little bucket of milk from where there was a barn and come across he seen the crowd he began to hear the music and he said well what we got company listen to the people in there when he walked in the door they're set his only beloved daughter sat in their plane Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross there's a precious fountain free to all the healing string that flows from calvary's Mountain then sitting there he dropped his bucket through his arms around and said honey what is it she said that one you call to reprobate Lord Jesus sent him here he laid his hands on me and now I am well when Jesus speaks he gives strength I say Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross Jesus let's just all stand his brother David comes [Music] [Applause] [Music] out there [Music] thank you [Music] from California [Music] forever [Music] until my raptures [Music] [Applause] hear the cross of trembling song [Music] us foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] that you would just let it those Rays shine within our soul draw us ever near to you father for it was in the cross that we were on your mind Lord that you paid for us and you purchased that book back and you took possession of the father and you opened it in our day oh we Rejoice within our hearts tonight in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to a couple scriptures real quick one found in the Book of Luke in the 24th the 20th or fourth chapter of the book of Luke let me see if I have that right here right I wrote it down and it said again we'll just read the 18th verse and then we'll jump over to the 27th verse you know the story well and and we know the story that Jesus came and and uh the two disciples uh were on their road to Emmaus and and we pick up the story and one of them whose name was cleopas answered saying unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hath not known the things which are come to pass therein these days you know he truly was a stranger wasn't it they really didn't know that and uh and he said unto them what things and they said concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and a word before God and all the people and then we'll read it the 27th verse and he began that Moses and all the prophets and expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh unto the village wherein they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat and meet with them he took bread and he blessed it and he break it and he gave it and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us well he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures amen and let's also turn over up to the book of Timothy II uh chapter 2 Timothy the third chapter and we'll be short on our end tonight we have a baptismal service so this is really a baptismal service this evening and then we'll get right to our baptism here in just a moment he says for this for this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetousness boasters proud blasphemers Disobedience to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affections truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with thy diverse lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth Heavenly Father we ask you to bless us in your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated I think one of the greatest things that the believer has to come to grip with now more than ever is the acceptance and I've maybe touched on this a time or two before and probably will continue to touch on it but it's the acceptance of your election to that there's nothing that we did within ourselves he said you are my disciples he said you have not chosen me I have chosen you and there's something very special about that that I think in the hour that we're moving into and the place that God's taking us that the believer if he keeps looking at himself in the mirror and he keeps he keeps trying to bring this outward man into a place of um how can I say a worthiness or he keeps looking at the self that he is thinking that if he can do a few things that he can put some effort into it that he can make the difference and the difference can be made but it's not going to be made by you or your flesh the difference is going to be made from the seed that is in you that that is what the believer finally has got to come to the realization of is there something in me that's going to transform me and he's got to realize from that point that there's a connection that you make with that which is in you that there's something inside of your heart that just says Amen to every word of God it comes from something deeper within you than than you can even understand even though you're warring with all the elements around you yet down inside there's a voice there's something that's connected something that's put there and that's him and so I'd like to just take this little message that my heart turned toward while I was on up with my mother and it's modern events are made clear by prophecy and that that's a very unique title because we look around and we see that things have come to the exact same uh condition that Timothy spoke of would come it would be perilous times and so we understand that the reason these times are here is because they were prophesied to be here the events doesn't turn determine the prophecy the prophecy has already determined the events the the reason that everything is is in the condition that it's in is because of the prophecy that was spoken that man no longer wished to retain God in their thinking so God gave them over to a reprobate mind so by by being able to to look at the events that are coming to pass according to prophecy then it causes us that there's a realization that there's prophecies concerning us and I believe that's what our brother preached he said don't miss the prophecy and we'd like to expound on that uh just added a little bit more certainly couldn't preach it any better but to say that if if all these other things around us are true then other prophecies concerning us must be true also and and so then you can stand back and you can look at yourself and say well what did God promise he promised he'd have an elect seed he promised that in every age in order to prove his word he plants a seed there that will be able to accept that word that that is how that he chose to prove his word he chose his word to to have a heart that would receive it it would be no good if they ever produced a radio wave or a television wave if they didn't have a receiver you know there had to be something that could receive it in order to turn it into a radio Sound or a a visual transmission or whether it just can't be transmitted it's got to be transmitted from something to something and that's how the the frequencies work is they get they can send it on a certain frequency or a certain wavelength in no my way am I Electronics person at all but I know that they can adjust that receiver they'll receive that in every other signal is not received it's blocked down and so that you cannot you can get a receiver and you can create something that will only receive uh this signal now if you were blessed with that receiver that you could receive the signal then everybody else around you that wasn't receiving the signal would think that you're false [Music] no this does not look that I can go through all my channels that this frequency doesn't exist what you're hearing isn't true what you're hearing isn't real uh there's uh where are you getting this from it's because they weren't ordained to receive the signal yeah okay there there was no connection to put in there and and then that that immediately causes people to begin to to to look at the outside the outside's the same you know okay you know everything about it on the outsides the same if this building's the same as a lot of churches it's got people sitting in it like a lot of churches they're all reading the same Bible like a lot of churches everything's the same but what what what's the difference amen because that that that's the whole key I I thought our brother brought that out he said we're different but what makes you different you've got to come to the realization I do we all do have got to come to the realization of what makes us different and what makes us different is what was put into us from the foundation of the beginning of the world and what he put in US is what has the power to transform us right the the signal if I can't comes to the seed and it makes the seed transform into what it was planted for just like the Rays of the sun and the think if you plant a field out there you could put a different kind of seed every way and the sun would come down but just that one seed has got an identification already within it that when it receives the sun rays and it receives the the water and it receives the nutrient from the earth it produces something that's completely different than the seed next to it so you couldn't say it was the ground you couldn't say it was the sun you couldn't say it was the water what what made that seed different was how it was created in the beginning okay so you're not made different by your decision you're not made different by your determination to live a good life you're not made different by any of those things what made you different is what he planted in you that's why he said my sheep know my voice and another they won't follow and you have not chosen me I have chosen you well that's strange you think in one way but now you understand how that he chose you how that he chose you you didn't ask for it but you got it and there comes a time when you get real thankful you have it you really thank the Lord and so we see that in this story that we're talking about that Jesus is walking with these guys and they ask them are you a stranger don't you know what's happening aren't you aren't you familiar with the events that have transpired well they had no idea really what Advance had transpired you understand they looked at it they saw the the movement of the government they saw the movement of the church they they saw all these movements going on they saw all these reactions they saw all these responses but they didn't really see what was going on as far as the Fulfillment of the scriptures now and I say that to us because he makes this statement he says do you realize that that's promised again in this very age that we're living in amen that that the people would see the church moving they would see the government moving they would see all the circumstances and all the commotion and all the contrast in all the conflict because every time God moves in his word there's a conflict there's a there's a there's a clash there's there's something that's going on and The Clash that's going on in the world today the wars the rumors of wars the political unrest this social movement and that social movement uh the the whole the transgender thing the whole political thing the whole uh indictment thing all these things the bribery things all that stuff is going on it is is not really what's going on those events are not describing prophecy prophecies describing the the events that are going on it's because of what God's doing that all this is happening now this is three to Second further what he said just uh this is paragraph 19 modern events made clear by prophecy I think it's 12 uh uh 12 6. he said do you realize that it's promised again in this very age that we're living in the lady of cnh the seventh Church age that we're in now is naked miserable blind and don't know it so that's where they are but now listen to why the world is in the condition it's in the same as he blinded them back there for the purpose of getting his message through to the elected people he promised to do the same thing today the whole purpose of this is to get this message through to you the elect people okay the message is for the elect people you click I said once you have that receiver in you won't you have that seed in you that predestinated part in you that separates you from thing you're going to receive something that they just can't receive they just don't see and that that's what's separating you but the thing visit what good does it do you if you've got the receiver if you're not going to tune in on the message of what what's transpiring what what's going on so we can clearly see that the modern events that are happening around us are are truly made clear To Us by the prophecy concerning us that God would have an elect lady he would have someone that he would call out that he would separate and have them come out from amongst them and be separate and so we could see that that uh that that comes to that beautiful place he says over here and and I think this is a another good thing that that we can look at just for a second we'll probably go farther at later times he said in paragraph three he said and he is the word Saint John 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore we're living in the day when the manifestation of the word of God has come to a different age than the Pentecost age so it's come to a different manifestation than the Pentecostal manifestation and we found a great conflict in that today because people were wanting to take the Pentecostal manifestations and use it as manifestation for the message took in other words we want to vindicate the message by trying to use the vindications of another age and we're not in that manifestation so there's something else that's going to be manifested you said well we still pray for the sick he always was a Healer can we still dream dreams we can still dream dreams we can still see Visions but that's not the evidence of what's transpiring in this age Paul said all these things will do if God so permits but let us move on to perfection so there's something else that these modern events is causing the elect to zero in on the prophecies concerning them all right I hope I can say very clear the modern events that are trans that are transpiring and the prophecies that are coming to pass they're there to cause the elect to zero in on the prophecies concerning themselves that I know it doesn't do me no good to keep sitting around and looking out and saying this is coming to pass this is coming this way and never coming to the places what's coming to pass about me what am I bringing to pass what what prophecies am I fulfilling what what's my place in the plan what's my personal uh place my my eating my bread with singleness of heart and working out my own salvation with fear and trembling what is it bound to when it comes down to me again what am I seeing fulfilled in my life what what are the expectations that I have for myself what part am I playing foreign if that's been prophesied and we said the reason that it's coming to pass is so he can get his message to the elect to then what I'm interested in is what plea has prophesied about the elect are those prophecies transpiring in me and if I'm going to believe them I've got to hear them because Faith cometh by hearing can hear it by the word of God you can you know what I mean the signal can be out there but if you don't turn on the Transformer or the trans receiver it's not going to get get the signal so if I could I don't have a title but I in fact one just come to my mind it would be turn yourself on and uh get tuned in you know when I was a hippie it was drop out and you know don't tune in at all you know but this is the elect lady so if we find out so you you can't you you've got to step back yes there was a Pentecostal age yes yes there was a great manifestations in everything but could you understand why that was I mean what the what does why the scripture decided that it would come to a shock let me just read it to you it struck me when I said it he said and he's talking you know how it tried he says finally it goes into the tassel that's John Wesley in the Wesley age and it had the pollen dropped back and paragraph 34. from there came the Pentecostal age so close just like the real grain of wheat if you look at the stock but if you'll take that weed and move it back there's not one grain in it at all it's only a shut in the shape of the grain but it it sat there for the purpose to shelter the grain now just think of that now okay at the end I hope this is in wrong for me to say but as I I was out at my mom's there in Michigan my mom's sister's house visited my mom my mom watches the the television that she watches she watches Mass on television and and the rosary on television so I sat down it can you know flip the button and and there and there's a whole section of religious channels there and and as I pretend to watch I mean you can you just can't believe what you see I mean from every end of the spectrum you know and and of course you you know my my favorite I've always uh kind of in my heart wish that someday I'd get the opportunity to cross paths but my favorite uh television preacher Joyce Myers is there and and I mean you know she's got those big earrings like probably I guess like saddle stirrups I believe and and he got the big and her hair is cut so short and and I mean she's just everything total opposite of the word of God to me and she's got a great big following and she's she's saying all these things and a lot of things she says is good like our brother said it's just bears and you can just go down down down down down down and and all this and the music and and uh and uh uh you know uh the brother Jimmy Swaggart and and he I'm telling you the guy can sing I mean I I just would sit there and close my eyes and just listen to him singing and he's got good lyrics and good songs and and there's nobody that can cry the way he can cry and he just tugs at your heart and and you sit back and you see all this thing and then you start looking at the range that it's all covering it and you you sit back and says none of them are saying the same thing but what was it for why was it allowed why did it come in the form that it came in why did it come with the with all the healing that went forth and all the uh emotion that went forth and all the gifts that went forth and all those things did you ever realize the prophet of God said that was a for our protection yes okay let me just read this in close in this quote he says there's not one one grain in it all it's only shot in the shape of a grain but it was set there for a purpose so it was set there for a purpose not a purpose to run back to not a purpose to reproduce so many people miss when he said that this is the restoration of the Faith of Our Fathers that it wasn't the restoration of the manifestation it was the restoration of the revelation and the Revelation that they had was this was the Fulfillment of all the law and all the prophets and that the gospel they went out and preached was the Gospel of the Old Testament fulfilled that's what they went and preached that Jesus fulfilled all the things concerning the prophet when Jesus talked to him he started at Moses because there were no Epistles and he started at Moses and he went through all the scriptures concerning themselves and their heart burned within them so now their Revelation was that he was the Fulfillment of the word of God so the faith of the fathers was the recognition of what prophecies were being fulfilled in their day that they were chosen they were elected to stand into a position and bring this good news and that's what the disciples did all except for Paul because he wasn't called in that he was called for a different purpose which was to bring the same gospel to the Gentiles and he was gifted to do that the rest of them brought it back to their Brethren and were telling them that that these this word has been fulfilled so it came to a purpose Pentecost had its purpose it was to shelter the Grain and tell if the Sun hits it like that it'd kill it another kept the sunlight of this message didn't have Pentecost to shelter the crane that the The Virtue and the glory of this message would have killed it you might not ever be able to see that because you were raised in a Pentecostal age where the supernatural people begin to feel the spirit but can you imagine people that have never had the spirit and all of a sudden one stood in their midst and discerned the thoughts and intents of their heart called them out laid hands on the sick that would have killed them they wouldn't have known what to do with it but that's not that that's not our end so that was the purpose he said it was a protection so that he could give the message to the elect and as we go on he says it's got to stay there until a certain time and all the life leaves the shock as it left the stock left the pollen leaves the shut and goes into the wheat the forms again just like it was down in the ground now all of us know that whenever a message is given in three years they form an organization and when they do it kills it right there it did it in the days of Luther it did in the days of Wesley it did it in the days of Alexander Campbell and the rest of them and it did it in the days of Pentecost exactly you get to a you get to a place each one gets starchy and gets off and they can't receive new revelation they couldn't receive it well how come you received it they didn't have anything in them to believe with why do you believe why do you see it are you so brilliant oh there was something in you it was a gift of God for you to receive it what a blessing it was it was just a gift of life for you by his choosing so beautifully given he said and you get to a place he took he says they settled down and there they are and and they die and the life goes right through that and goes right on to make the weed and when the wheat come that life that traveled through that wheat the resurrection brings the whole thing out yes brings it up for the rapture and I'm just going to read what another uh well I I think I'll just uh I'll just read this statement and then we'll go right to water baptism it says we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age amen see we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age we're living up here to the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture that's the age we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth what are you called for somebody here's called for the rapture Hallelujah amen it was not this age it's not another age we're not called to to go reproduce the gifts again to to go back all those in what we're called to do is have the Resurrection Life in us if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell in you it will Quicken also your mortal body we could go a much more on that subject but uh I just want to close again with this by seeing the things that are transpiring around us we understand that as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the day of the revelation of the son of man as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and we can truly see the Union that God's bringing together the invisible Union of Christ in this bride so we can set ourselves and understand what prophecies are concerning us that we're called to become one with the word of God to have that nature to have that Spirit to have that wisdom to have isaf that we might see character gold Trident fire white rain that our nakedness doesn't appear and we can focus in on what it is that we're preparing for we're not trying to recover an age gone by we're not trying to manifest in age gone by we're not trying to prove this message by an age gone by and I'll just uh I was I might as well read this statement because uh it's so good um and that if I I don't know if brother Adrian is going to help me with the baptism but we'll get ready at this time he says notice we find this as paragraph 100 notice we find today that people there's many people just can't believe it even Spirit-filled people I'm going to give you I'm going to give you one it'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with you your soul that's the baptism see here in the inside soul in here has to come from God but then on the outside you have five senses five inlets to your contact your Earthly home the inside you have a spirit and there you have five Outlets your conscience and love and so forth five Outlets to that Spirit but remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost if the soul that lives that was ordained of God oh that's that answers it do you understand that's what you've got to look at what's in my soul but what's in my soul my soul my there's something in my soul or something that's receiving this okay that believes that even though I'm struggling with my flesh even though I'm struggling with things I I can't deny it like Peter said where can I go that alone hath the words of eternal life it's settled in your heart this is the truth that's the part that if if we're going to go forward that's if I can say that that's the ultimate faith of the believer it's not secondhand Faith I've got the seed because I got this feeling I've got the seed because I've got this gift I've got the seed because I got this baptism when it comes down to the point it says I believe this I didn't believe it of myself it's in my heart I see it's true it doesn't matter what condition I'm in it doesn't matter what I'm involved in alls I can do is there's something inside of me that says Amen to every word of God and I want this life that's in the seed that eternal life I want that life to be in me all right thank you we get into a whole brand new definition of what the Holy Ghost did that's right that's right and it goes Way Beyond experience it is an experience but it's generated from two different places one's generated from within once generated from without amen and that part that's in you comes from God believe it don't look at yourself and say why because I look at you and I shake my head and they go more you've got to be kidding me why did you do this why'd you pick this guy but if he did you're going to spend eternity with them if he picked you so little children love one another don't judge one another the seed will prevail seed will prevail it will bring to path what he promised at the path we're not going back to another age we're coming to maturity the acceptance improving his word he said Jesus believed what the word of God said he was he said can't we believe what the word of God says we are that perfect faith is when you believe and accept that seed is in you despite yourself when I see hippie that seed was there but that seed found me amen and it separated me I didn't want to stop I didn't I didn't want to quit it made me quit it made what I love become so miserable to me that it pushed me and restrain
