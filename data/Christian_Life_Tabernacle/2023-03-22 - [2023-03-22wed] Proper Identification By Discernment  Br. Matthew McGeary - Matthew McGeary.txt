the name of Jesus Christ you're going to make it out by the Holy Ghost you're going to make it out by the message of the hour because we have a living hope my God is not dead he's living and he's alive and he's in his people the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise the one that set us free let's just go before him Heavenly Father we love you we're so thankful we can be gathered into an atmosphere into a realm by faith where all things are possible to them that believe and Lord we can believe tonight because you sent a message Lord faith comes by hearing and hearing a word Lord and you sent a word Lord that would produce a faith in us that we can believe all things so Lord Here We Are Tonight father asking that you would come Lord break the bread of life to us tonight Lord as only you can Lord may we just move our thoughts and our feelings aside Lord maybe we've had a a hard day and and the enemy's been after our mind and we're tired and body but Lord here we are to just lay at your feet tonight have communion [Music] Lord we just want to start letting the cares of the world just fall away Lord though we've been students of the word and we've heard many sermons and listened to many preachers Lord You're The Living Hope and we don't want to take this as just a routine but we want to look into your word and know that you're here by Divine promise to speak to our Heart Lord because your word is a discerner knows exactly what we have need of so now Lord we just Avail ourselves to your Holy Spirit to come and move in a supernatural way we pray and Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen praise His wonderful name if you have your Bibles let's turn in Hebrews chapter 5. just a familiar reading here Hebrews chapter 5 we'll be reading verse 12 through 14. maybe we'll just step back one verse of whom we have many things to say and had hard to be uttered senior dull of hearing for when the time he ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use having their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil Prophet when reading that he would say to know what's right and wrong by discernment we just pray a blessing upon the word you may be seated just want to read a little statement out of the church age book brother Branham says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works and attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he is cashed into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now I just want to maybe speak to you a little bit about proper identification by discernment you know just just when he says here by God's spirit discern and withstand we want to be able to properly identify the spirits we want to be able to properly discern and if we're going to do that it's going to come by Revelation it's going to come by the spirit of God if we're ever going to have proper discernment it's going to be by the spirit it's going to be by Revelation and as our pastor spoke about maturing to reality he dealt with perception and I just really appreciated that because you know it's so easy to allow your your preconceived ideas and the way you think things might be or or maybe you studied a certain subject and if we're not careful we end up putting God into a box we kind of whenever a minister starts going down a certain Trail or something we're like oh yes I've already studied that I know where he's going and you actually start connecting all of the dots intellectually and you totally close the Holy Spirit out from the equation but if you'll just act like you've never heard it before and say oh God why didn't you start to speak to my heart what are you trying to say to me Lord I have a knee tonight I want you to speak to me and you count it as though you haven't obtained anything and you just press toward the mark of the high calling and you can learn from Jesus Christ he can speak to your heart but you know your preconceived ideas and the way that you've you've come to know something can really be a big hindrance you know as a certified artist you know I'll be called on as a tree doctor and I'll go out to to a customer's house and and you know they they'll tell me well this is this is what's going on and some of them are like well yeah my tree got hit by lightning I'm like oh you don't say they're like yeah you see right here uh right here this black mark going down the tree and the limbs laying over and here they're going to explain to me like I'm supposed to be the expert I'm supposed to be the tree doctor I'm the one that they've called over to see what I can do for the tree but they're telling me everything that happened it was storming and the winds were blowing and I heard the flashing the the a big Flash and a big boom and I come outside and this limb was on the ground and and after they get that this is their perception they're telling me it's like well you know um that wasn't lightning um you know that that black mark there is just a bad Union where where the limbs were growing together and it was promoting some rotten Decay and the winds came in the no I heard it I saw the last I saw the flash of light and I come out there and you see that black mark and you're like well I'll tell you what isn't that something but you see they they have a they they already know they've self-diagnosed the situation they they they they because of what they heard because of what they saw and because of what they felt and when they come out and they saw it on the ground they come to these conclusions and that's a lot of times what we do with our own perceptions we self-diagnose we come to a conclusion we study a certain subject we listen to the message and and if we're not careful all said we put God in a box that's no longer a living hope it's a dead hope it's a dead religion it's just a Creed and it's a Dogma look if you think you can do a book report on on the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Heavenly bridegroom and just come up with with a summation and say here this is what the prophet was saying you've missed it you've missed it now it'll speak to you in this season that you're living you can say oh this is how it spoke to me and this is this is what popped out to me this time to tell you and listen to it the next day listen to it the next week listen to it the next month and that word will just be a Living Word continuing to speak to you continuing to lead you and guide you why because the scripture says in Hebrews 4 12 it says for the word of God is quick powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the divining asunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints in the marrow and what is it it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it's not a one-time thing it's a discerner of the thought and intents of your heart the discerner of the thoughts and intents of situations and that's what we want is that Living Word to be alive and moving inside of us because the words are discerner you know the prophet talks about an anointed ones at the end time he goes let me just show you how deceptive the devil is and he starts to talk about Martin there I believe we just recently heard this and how he's there in a study and then all of a sudden here this this one appears before Martin and it looks like Jesus and he has a crown on his hand he says Oh Martin Bow Down and Worship me and that Prophet there he kept looking at him and just something didn't seem quite right and the prophet says look the scriptures kept running through his mind because what was he doing he was Discerning by the word the word is a discerner he was looking at the situation and say my this looks good this looks right this looks like it's of the Lord but what did he do he went to the wire and he said you know what what does the word have to say about this and that Prophet stood there the word now Discerning says no Satan you get behind me because the word says that the Saints will crown him on that day and you're wearing a crown right now that's contrary to the word of God and one of the Prophet go on and say he says you know that would have been good Pentecostal bait and something that looks good it looks right it has a good feeling it gots a lot of emotion to it oh I tell you what this is just this is just so good sounds like Peter he got all worked up one day man it's just good to be here isn't this good I'm gonna go build a tabernacle for for Moses and I'm gonna build a tabernacle for Elijah and I'm gonna what else and he was a pagan right there in the presence of this Lord Peter turned into a pagan he can make a tabernacle for three gods don't tell me Peter didn't think it was right he was enthused he was excited he was ready to get it done how many times do we get enthused how many times do we get excited how many times do do we feel something is right and we want to run off after something but we need to be properly taught because the word is a discerner we have to apply the word and allow the word to discern it that way we can step back and say no right here it says right here in the Bible no the prophet said this and the word will discern that situation in your life if we'll just wait on him remember if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now we are not waiting for something in the future to come and I want to just say this the prophet already manifested this this has already been manifested when he says if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church what did we receive look the word the word came in this age in this generation the revealing of the son of man it was made flesh it was a discerner of the thoughts and intents it was the discerner of the two Spirits within the framework of the church and it was by God's spirit he withstood that Antichrist spirit and I tell you in the name of the Lord Satan was powerless before the prophet of the age he was powerless before him and the prophet was subject to the word and and I just want to say this as we maybe get to this a little later our definition and our preconceived idea of what powerless means and what an invincible Army has been very obscured we we have our definition of what what it means of Satan's powerless before we have our definition of what it means for the bride to be in an invincible Army because we got all this Hollywood and television programs and we think we're going to be some Spider-Man and some Superman and we're going to be this invincible Army running around emptying out hot that is not what God had in his mind it's going to be according to the word that's exactly why Jesus had to rebuke Peter hear the Lord's telling Peter look this is I yes I'm the Messiah I have come and now these are the things that I have to do I have to die I have to go away but Peter tells the Lord no Lord not so you're not going to do those things look at who he's talking to because Peter had in his mind what the Lord had come to do well he's going to restore the kingdoms we're gonna we're gonna kick all the Romans out of here we're going to have the promised land all of ourselves we're going to be an invincible Army he's just going to go around and pluck all these Romans and throw them out of here we're just going to have a good old time and they were all waiting when is this going to happen and now all of a sudden he's saying no look I Gotta Die I got to go fulfill all these things that Peter's saying not so Lord that's why Jesus turned to Peter and rebuked him because Peter was under a preconceived idea Peter was leaning to his own understanding Peter was leaning to his intellect and I'm afraid that many of us have got caught in the same trap of our own intellectual interpretation of the message and if we're not careful we're just good Baptists and good Pentecostals with some fake Creator some Dogma that won't take you out of the grave we gotta die out to our own thinking Gotta Die out to our own ideas for the word with say in Romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God now I just want to lay in this quote again out of the church age book you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ God the anointed one no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world now have we just become good uh message Believers and we just put a check mark by that well I have already done that or should we call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world should that be something that's constant something we're constantly praying for Revelation praying for Faith In God's word we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it I I feel like he's speaking to message Believers now you you've accepted that God sent a prophet you've accepted Malachi 4 5 and Luke 17 30 and all of these wonderful things but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there now don't let that discourage you that's an encouragement to let you know that that's why you are here that is why God sent the message that's why you believe the Bible and the great truths that have been revealed in this hour and now he's telling you that it will become real what did our pastor talk about maturing to reality we need Revelation by the spirit to make this message a reality in our life now as we just keep moving in a certain direction Jesus would say in Matthew 26 41 he'd say watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak you know one of the things about the flesh the flesh is weak you know one of the weaknesses is we're too strong we we try to serve God in our own capacity and our own ability what it what did Paul say in Galatians 3 3 said oh oh foolish Galatians that you started in the spirit but now are you perfected in the flesh we're guilty of that I was telling brother Billy they're just in the office I said that's a refrigerator uh scripture that needs to be on the bathroom mirror are you so foolish having begun in the spirit that you're now perfected In the Flesh many of us come into the great truth and the great revelation of the message and we catch some some wonderful things and if we're not careful we start to lean on our own understanding we start to lean on our own intellectual capacity we start to lean on things that we've maybe uh heard and if we're not careful we don't let the Holy Spirit by Revelation bring those things to a reality in our life the prophet would say this in perfect strength by Perfect weakness God passes those who think there's something to take somebody that don't know nothing in order to work his purpose in their life well praise God God passes those that think there's something to take somebody that don't know nothing oh well at least I got that part figured out I don't know nothing and Lord let me let me die out and humble myself where I really don't know nothing I just know what I was out there in the world I was nothing without him I have nothing I don't have no ability I don't have no capacity but oh with him there's the answer and God takes somebody that don't know nothing in order to work his purpose in their life that's what we get God said to Paul my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker more you can yield to me the better I can use you the more you can forget about your education the more you can forget about your denomination the more you can forget about your stuff and yield yourself to me the more I can use you because you become weak I'll make my own purpose strong God can make strength out of weakness that's the reason he always does it there's where the flesh can be weak is in thinking that we've obtained you know they have the old saying you can't teach an old dog new tricks you know you get somebody in work and in business if they've done something a certain way for so long it's really hard to teach them the proper way to do something and if we find ourselves approaching the word of God in a way that we've already obtained in in a way that well I've read this before and I tell you it's so easy for us to to read the Bible or listen to a message and if we're not careful we I don't mean this in a negative way but we kind of do it in the flesh you know we just it's what we do we're Christians we're Believers you know we read our Bible we pray we we listen to the message of the hour but but if you can just slow it down and say you know what Lord now I'm approaching you I I I need to approach you right now Lord and and maybe I only got five minutes maybe I only got 10 minutes Lord but I want it to mean something I want to be in communion with you I I just don't want to listen to this tape uh just to appease uh maybe an a religious uh uh a duty that I have and and so I can feel like I've done my job but oh if I can approach the Living Word if I can approach the word that's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of my heart and I can say Lord speak to my heart today give give me a word give me a message give me something out of this uh this five ten minutes of this sermon Lord when I open up my Bible in the First Corinthians or may there be a something that just opens up to me in such a greater way I want to hear from you today and you get on your knees and it's not just your laundry list of things and and just a routine just a routine vain repetition sometimes I wonder if you recorded your prayer and just listen them to him back you might find out it kind of sounds like vain repetition imagine if you talk to your wife like that or your husband like that like I mean we've had this same conversation like every night honey are we ever going to get past that hey I'm sorry right but we we want it to be living we want it to be moving we want it to be intimate we want it to be breaking we want it to be unfolding we want it to be living we want a living word that's living in an unfolding in our lives because outside of that if we're just comparing what we already know and we're just being intellectual then we're missing it as Paul would say in First Corinthians 2 verse two through five he says for I am determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and Power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God that's where it is that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but it should stand in the power of God look the church is not run by the man's Wisdom the church is not run by man's abilities we want to be free from that that's nicolaidism if we're dependent on the intellect of man and man's abilities to interpret scriptures and all of these things then we're missing something but the individual has to be in a love relationship with Jesus Christ the word in your heart the spirit bringing Revelation to you as the individual now we're talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time now we're talking about a church that's that's growing into maturity the prophet of God I threw this in there I really like it he says I don't care how intellectual you are we still got Canary brains because we're only human beings anytime you think you're anybody or anytime you think you're something or any time you think it all got you got it all figured out and anytime you think I can just explain this and and just run this all the way down just oh Canary brain Canary brain God is known by the spirit and by the Revelation by the Holy Ghost we will never be able to understand him through intellectual oh I say Lord help me I've I've come to a lot of intellectual conclusions about the message of the hour I've done studies and I've done this and I've listened to that sermon and I feel like I got a pretty good handle of it and I've come to an intellectual conclusion Canary brain but go back to those things and say Lord I'm coming to you again break it to me further Lord I I need Revelation Lord Jesus I really want to I really want something to break to me this time Lord you spoke to me last time I heard this message Lord but speak to me again I really want more of you Lord speak to my heart speak to my life lord it's it's spiritual food and due season it's a storehouse full of the blessings of God Lord let this mind be in me oh God speak to me through your Prophet as I sit down and listen speak to me through your words speak to me through your Bible Lord open up Lord Jesus in prayer all of these things are available it's the inheritance to the believer a prophet would go on to say this in the church age book he says the true Revelation the true Revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what he promised now just let that hold the true revelation is God interpreting God manifesting God interpreting his own word by vindicating what he promised he goes on to say Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when he was here on Earth and was comp was compiled exactly as was our new testament make no's mistake about it we have the infallible word of God today and no man dares takes from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us now he says Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when here on Earth that authenticated means to prove to be real to be true or to be genuine proved to be real proved to be genuine now I don't know how to say it any more simple than this but just as Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when here on Earth by Divine promise according to Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 and Revelations 10 7 the ministry of William Branham completely authenticated the New Testament authenticated means to prove Hallelujah to prove to be real or Genuine it didn't matter how many Devils they lined up it didn't matter how much sickness it didn't matter how many diseases or whatever it was through the ministry of William Branham those Devils could be cast out they could be defeated why because Jesus Christ the same yesterday was proving and authenticating that he is alive and living amongst his church it was left to man's ideas it was left to man's theologies but God by Divine promise what did it say the true revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what he promised that's what he did through Malachi 4 5. he Vindicated what he promised and I just want to say this that what God did through the prophet to the age right he traveled around the world almost seven times uh over 1100 sermons uh thousands upon thousands of Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart uh uh uh the blind eyes opened the dead raised all of these things what was it it was God vindicating his word god vindicating what is promised and he did it to the age but I want to say that God is also now taking individuals and authenticating or vindicating the spoken word he's taken you he's taking individuals now he wants to take your life and your situation and your job and your family and now the word that has been spoken the message of the hour is now coming into your skin and into your flesh and now you are vindicating what God promised in the life that you now live what do you say you be then you become a written Epistles red of all men the word made flesh in you I like this quote out of the invisible Union the brother Branham says uh he says what is it he says can't you see where we're standing the life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in Bride form same power same church same thing same word where in you you're the Invincible Army you're the one that is now authenticating the message because now it's that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead is now quickening your mortal body to prove that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever staking individuals now we just keep working towards a point by God's grace we'll get there the prophet says now notice God promised in his word that he would choose his bride by his original way he chose the bridegroom I like this really going to start catching what's really taking place notice God promised in his word that he would choose his bride by the original way he chose the bridegroom I'm glad I can just keep reading he foretold it by the prophets and sent a prophet to identify it now we're talking about proper identification by discernment he foretold it by the prophets and sent a prophet to identify it and the prophet said standing on the banks of Jordan Behold the Lamb Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world look nobody else saw the word coming but that was John's job that's why he was called he was called to identify the word he said there's one that stands among you now whose shoes lashes I'm not even a worthy but then what happened all of a sudden the word what the word came to the prophet I don't want to say the word identifies the prophet and the prophet identifies the word you can't separate them it's a perfect match and Jesus Christ the word made flesh came to the prophet of the age and the prophet said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world that is exactly what has taken place in our generation he foretold it by the prophets and sent a prophet to identify it the prophet properly identified the word and the word identified the prophet searched the scriptures and then you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me don't you realize it was the son of man Ministry all over again he wasn't quoting a scripture from 2000 years ago it was none other than the son of man Ministry taking on flesh again performing the same signs and wonders saying the same thing to the Gentiles say search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life in them you've been blessed with speaking in tongues and I've poured out my spirit on All Flesh and all of those things in them you think you have eternal life but that's the very word that testifies of who I am and what did they do they rejected the word the word came to the prophet and what the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now we'll just walk through this quickly but discerner relates to judging and when you look into the scripture there when it says the word is a discerner that word is only used one time in scripture but it comes from the root word meaning judge so we know that Jesus Christ stood there and he said look I am the bread that cometh down out of heaven I am the word made flesh I am the one that come down to heaven we know what happened in our generation 1961 was it was the mighty angel it was the bread coming down out it was the opening of the word it was the third book I'll meet you in there what was it it was it was God interpreting his word by bringing it to pass it was Revelations 10 1-7 the mighty angel coming down I am the bread that come down out of heaven I am the word I am the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the art I am the discerner I am the judge well if you can't see the judge you're not looking at it right turn it to the right what is it it's the Supreme judge what it's the quickening power it's the Discerning of the thoughts and if the word is a discerner don't don't limit that to to a prayer line my that wasn't if you if you will that was uh one part of it it was proving that it was the word because it could know things that no one else would know that way you could have comfortable Hallelujah that way you knew that when it spoke who was speaking what way the first and second pull but then it was the opener of the word look uh in The Believer there's something in us we can't deny the first pull we can't deny the second Bull oh it speaks to our soul but then when we hear the opening of the word oh you you can't help but be overwhelmed with joy because it sounds like home but all of these things have been thoroughly identified right the prophet labored on that he said look they took the picture we didn't take it turn it to right who is it that's our Lord up there it's the Supreme judge it's been thoroughly identified and that's what he says here in the rising of the sun he says and there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he's Alpha into maker the beginning and the end what identification I couldn't identify that I'm sorry no one could identify except the one that was predestinated to be able to identify the word coming without Malachi 4 5 you cannot identify the word I'm sorry kick me out of the church call me until I know I know the pastor gots my back without Malachi 45 you cannot identify the word because God said I will send you Elijah the prophet he will turn the heart back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers what was their faith in the revealed word the unadulterated word of God that had been stolen from the church down Through the Ages but by Divine promise God said I'm going to send you a prophet and I'm going to come again and he will identify my coming Hallelujah it's been thoroughly identified he is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and end what identification quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming quickening power snatched us from death to life quickening power gives discernment to know now don't don't don't let's not move too fast to this I want to take my time quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you leave this in history Church quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do you want to know what to do here it is quickening power gives the sermon to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you have done and what you ought not to have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power all these things look that's what this message this word has done it's discerned your heart it's told you who you are it told you where you came from tells you where you went wrong it tells you what you need to make right it tells you what you should have done I love this but it tells you what you are it tells you what you will be this ain't a hope so message this is a reality that's what the word has come to do is to discern your heart to tell you who you are and what you need to do and where you came from and what you're going to be look the message is still alive it's still discerning and we just continue to move as just laying a little Foundation there first Corinthians 2 13. and 14 it says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God you want to know why you had a little hard time struck today well maybe the natural man the man the natural man has a problem with the Christian Life as a problem with putting others before yourself the natural man has a problem with you humbling yourself and and always taking the back seat the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him why that is so foolish that you would make less money to be in church on Sunday why would you ever that's so foolish but we got two services on Sunday and I can make this work some people can live by that I I'm I'm not I'm just too ignorant to figure anything else out I just know that the word is right and if I can just stay with that I'm gonna be all right I mean I just know I'll be okay right there if I can just stay right there as soon as I start trying to figure it out and and try to say well yeah I could do that and then if I just came on that day and this day oh and now I'm just messing everything up because I tell you if you just stay with God's word he'll take care of you they are foolishness unto him and neither can they know them because they are spiritually discerned how we we've been dealing with discernment discern means to investigate to examine to inquire into you know sometimes you witness to people about the message and sometimes you know you you tell somebody you know tell them about serpency they're like yeah like all right all right oh man tell them about godhead tell them about water baptism man okay I mean he's taking it all in you keep running down the line like I'll tell you what happened in 19 yeah yeah and Olson you're like wait a second here he's just good with everything yeah yeah yeah that's great yeah yeah yeah I'm like you you want somebody to like to seem like they're like gonna investigate or like scrutinize or really examine it or take it back to the word like did he really say that some people are just whatever you tell them I'm good with it I'm good with it oh really I really really really oh okay is that what the prophet said okay that's not it Church how much second-hand Revelation do you want you know church we got to grow up that when somebody wants to sit down and talk to you about Doctrine or the Seven Seals or or talk to you about water baptism you can do that you got this you're the word made flesh don't don't start don't start like oh I got a call I got to call brother so and so I gotta call sister so and so and if and if you do need to do that let us let something in your heart you say you know what Lord let me be a student of Thy word let me study to show myself approved and if anything just tell them how your candle got lit and if your candle ain't been lit let's get desperate for a candle lighting and not some Catholic thing out there we don't want that we want the real fire of the Holy Ghost to change you to investigate to examine to inquire to question it's okay to have questions you know that that's exactly what happened to the Queen of Sheba she heard of the fame of Solomon she heard she heard of the wisdom of Solomon and there was like a deep calling to a deep and something inside her said oh could could this be true and what did the Queen of Sheba do she investigated some people won't cross the street to going to church some people won't make the effort but look at the Queen of Sheba she made that I don't know I think if you look at me I don't know six months or two years I mean it was a journey but something in her heart said I am going to investigate I am going to discern for myself I'm going to show up there and I'm going to see if what I heard is true and the scripture would say in second chronicles 9 1 it was saying when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon now this is for this isn't just some random thing well I'm I'm trying to encourage you to how we should be approaching the word of God and how we should be inquiring of the message of the hour and how we should be crying out for Revelation and how we should be investigating the scriptures and we should be crying out for Revelation more than anything before that the Holy Ghost could so set you on fire and so illuminate your heart that that word would be a discerner of what is right and what's wrong that would be leading you and guiding you in all truth and all righteousness that you would be able by the word to discern and the Queen of Sheba heard of the famous Solomon and she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem have you ever proved the word of God with hard questions hey some of us come from some hard situations some of us need uh some really big answers but there's no question too hard for God there's no situation too hard for God if there's a word question there's a word answer but are you willing to come and inquire are you willing to investigate are you willing to lay on your face before the Lord and are you willing to prove this message with hard questions or do we accept an intellectual interpretation we accept all the buzzwords as the vindication that we got revelation you know I I haven't been doing it as long as some but by God's race going on 24 years of serving the lord the more you serve them the more you realize you don't know and you feel ashamed you feel little you look into the word and things that you I should have known that already Lord forgive me Lord I I thought I had that done I thought I understood it but but you you don't ever figure out God we can never get to a place where we're thinking like that we got to be in a love relationship with him where his word is leading us and unfolding us and and whatever Revelation he gives us it's there that we can help somebody else it's not there to lift ourselves up or to think we're somebody but it's for us to be the vehicle that God can use to help somebody else God's revealing himself to you and your person that you can be a a a light set on a hill not hidden under a bushel basket so let your light shine amongst men and I love the end of the Scripture it says she communed with him all that was in her heart prophet of God would say this in Ministry explained in 56 he says how do you know taste and see give God a chance see if he will take it and give you glory for your misery see if he will give you happiness for your Gloom see if he will give you health for your sickness see if he will give you the Holy Ghost for your theology try and see taste and see that the Lord is good let's give him a chance and the queen said I'll go see for myself now I want you to notice what a sacrifice when you come to see God you don't just come on a flower bed of these you have to make a sacrifice it's a sacrificial way it's a way of death you have to die out to come to him and you have to forget all you ever knowed in order to learn of him empty out that he can feel us you don't mix it now you have to empty out what did Paul say the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God because they are spiritually discerned we have to empty out we got to die I know we want to move we're going to move we really want to get down to good old fashioned everyday living the words applicable in your daily lives it has to be a reality oh we're not a kajal club we're not some uh book club and some religion and and we all got the same ideas and we got some headquarters somewhere our our headquarters is the kingdom of God we've received a message of God that's introduced us to Jesus Christ and we're walking with him so we're familiar with this scripture right so we're going to try to come back to how we open the Service here you know the prophet said the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs it at the command of his word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass well that's a big statement that's a big mouthful but you see that's the hour that we're living in we're living in the hour of adoption the hour of the maturity of the seed but what is that well what does that mean to me brother Matthew try to make it in a simple way here the prophet of God says you see God don't make all of our decisions there's many times that God doesn't tell His prophets just what to do because they have to make the decision if there is no decision that we have to make just wait every move on God then there is no overcoming on our part so we're talking about being mature Christians look look brother Brandon when he was sitting there and he said there's a trap set for you and he and he was there preaching and that couple was doing those lewd acts in front of him he had to make a decision he had to make the decision God didn't make it whatever you say he he had to make the decision but oh I tell you that couple they're they're lucky they're fortunate that God's a god of love a god of forgiveness and what is an adopted son it's somebody whose name is just as good on the check as the father and in that moment the decision that the prophet made I believe was the exact decision that the Lord wanted him to make so we have to make decisions but if there is no decisions there's no overcoming what does it say in Revelations 3 21 to them that overcome will I grant to sit with me and my throat you I if there's no decisions you got to make there's no overcoming we've got to overcome something we got to make decisions there's no decisions we have to make there's no overcoming on our part so I say what is your choice tonight what do you choose what are you choosing what did you choose today what are you going to choose tomorrow I choose Christ I choose this message I choose life I choose let this mind be in you that was also in Christ's I choose to die out to all of my ideas I choose to listen to the message of the hour I choose to rebuke the devil I rebuke the flesh I rebuke all this demonology out there I I choose to become subject to the word that's my choice the devil tells you you ain't gonna make it tells you you're gonna you're gonna give up you you can never manifest this message it's not for you it was for your mommy and daddy but you're really never going to catch anything about it I want to ask you what do you choose you don't listen to that old liar I say I choose to tell that Old Devil to shut up that's exactly what the prophet said tell that he'll be able to shut up go sit in a corner devil I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I choose life I choose this message I choose to manifest everything the prophet spoke of the pride of Jesus Christ that's why I'm here that is my choice so now we got a good foundation to move forward he is the word of God he is the quickening power this is out of proving his word he is the Holy Spirit the Dynamics that comes into the mechanics the words that make it live and it all has to work together we don't want to just a knowledge of the word we want a revelation of the word and then when the Dynamics comes to the mechanics which the mechanic says the word which you are just you being here you're a predestinated seed word that was placed here in this age the mechanics of it the letter of this Bible is the mechanics of it the spoken word without the life of the message is the mechanics of it the body of Jesus Christ which was the word made flesh laying in the Tomb without the spirit was the mechanics of it but the quickening power has to come to the word to make it live oh I said oh God I want the quickening power to give me the discernment to make this message live and by God's spirit discern and we span this two Spirits within the framework of the church and then we'll be an invincible Army amen so as we're just moving along these lines we won't hold you too much longer we're talking about discernment and proper identification by revelation of the word and God deals with individuals the same way he deals with the church so when the prophet would say this and see does not air with a shock you'd say notice see how close it looks Matthew said in Saint Matthew 24 said that the two spirits in the last days the church Spirit of the church people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people would be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if possible that's how close the church Spirit of the church people you want to know what a church spirit will make you do go to church pretty good huh Church Spirit take you to camps and meetings Church spirit will rejoice in manifestations of the spirits and gifts and operations a church spirit will do that a church spirit will rejoice in knowledge and intellectuals and bible studies and Men's breakfast and services a church spirit and a church people is a very religious spirit the washing of pots and pans and and all of the dress and everything and look at me I'm a church Spirit Church person go and church person people guy but when it comes to the word not just a portion of the word but when it comes to the fullness of the word it compromises every time the prophet of God said oh yes this false spirit that is in the last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word you gotta watch the word and whenever it is caught being anti-word it falls back on the argument we have already shown to be false I am so glad the word is a discerner without Malachi 4 5 we are lost let me rephrase that without Malachi 4 5 I know I'm lost I didn't have the ability I didn't have the capacity I didn't have the discernment I didn't have the right spirit I didn't have the right theology I didn't have any ability I had to hear a message because only the word which is a discerner would discern these things for the bride can only be distinguished by its deviation from the word and whenever it is caught being anti-word it always falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God now I'm trying to move towards something Spirits do not die now now yes Matthew 24 24 and and the two Spirits within the framework of the church it would be so closely would deceive the very elected possible that was manifested in the shock that was manifested in what brother Brandon would call the Pentecostal age or the third stage of the wheat plant or the restoration of the gifts justification sanctification restoration of the gifts the third stage of the weed plant right the shock what he would call the age of Pentecost it was a mixture of wrong seed and right seed it was Joel 2 28. I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh right the rain falls on the just and so is the rain the problem no the rain is not the problem God pours out a spirit upon the just and the unjust the difference is the seed but now we're dealing with the dispensation or an age the shock has died the shock is gone it's done dried up the Pentecostal age is long gone dead bury it but now the prophet will deal with with an age but God deals with the individual the same way he deals with the church Spirits don't die so we have the same Spirit the same church people Church spirit that same Antichrist Spirit the same shock in our own life that we got to pull away from being intellectual and thinking we got it all figured out we gotta die to that thing because as soon as you start feeling pretty good we fall back on well I get results don't I I gave my heart to the Lord I had a really good time well I went down to the altar that one time if you're not careful you start to justify your condition by previous experiences but I want to be walking with my Lord and Savior if the minister preaches the word and it convicts me in my heart I say amen I Repent Lord forgive me I want to be right I'm going to go lay my life down at the altar I'm going to rededicate my life to the Lord give me the Holy Ghost Lord give me discernment but we're so quick to Puff ourselves up well you know I've been doing pretty good for 24 years haven't missed a service that's that's that's church people Church Spirit stuff that's the same spirit we get results that showed up on that day have I not cashed out devils in thine have I not done Benny gray works we get results don't we have you not seen our meetings have you not seen our numbers have you not seen all these wonderful things that we've done depart from me you doers of iniquity I never knew you the difference is the elect seed will respond to the word they will not be satisfied with anything less than the word the pure unadulterated word I want to say that anything less than that is Pentecostal bait huh anything less than the full revelation of this message it's just Pentecostal bait it's a deviation from the word it's flashes and signs and and programs and organizations and emotions and feelings and we get results don't we but I want to be living in the Shekinah Glory I want to be shut away I'll meet you in there in the third pool where I'm eating the showbread I'm in the Shekinah Glory I'm eating the hidden manna nothing can get to you in there first John 4 1 says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world so we got to give it the word test the word identifies the seed has to be word coming to word you know like the magnet the great magnet give something the word test see if it fits when you hear the message you hear truth something in your heart you just it just does something for you that great magnet that great Eagle scream that that word's pulling you to Perfection it's pulling you to maturity it's pulling you it gots a hold of you and it's not going to let you go until you get to the end goal Prophet says this in discernment of spirit now we see all those prophets speaking every one of them was glorifying God in the coming Messiah would just be about 10 minutes and we'll come to a close now see all those prophets speaking every one of them was glorifying God and the coming Messiah and when they got in the spirit they acted and spoke and lived the life out just like the Messiah did if it did that that side of the cross speaking of his coming how much more will it after is coming we'll put the spirit of the Messiah in the church to act do work and live like the Messiah it's the spirit of God discern that Spirit see whether it is of god or not see whether it acts like him see if your emotions now watch catch this now you got to discern your own emotions you got to discern what spirit is working on your flesh that's working on your mind that's making you feel the way that you feel see if your emotions if somebody kicks up something against you and throws dirt upon your life when you know you're as innocent as you can be so now we're now we're getting down to where we're living we all want to go do some big great work and empty out a hospital but we don't want to turn our cheek we don't want to just be a Christian we don't want to just be the word made flesh when you know your innocent as can be and you know that you've got the spirit of God don't try to separate yourself don't try to act mean towards them don't curse them just walk on knowing that God did that to give you a test to see how you would take it now you know something struck my heart the other day and I didn't realize what some of our young people go through and the Lord just gave me a little Glimpse but you know when you're when you're in school and people talk bad about you or you know or or people treat you mean that's hurtful it can have a profound effect on somebody's Psyche on their self-esteem and and I was thinking about that and then I realized that our children are going through things that I never experienced because the very our the very ones that are supposed to be our brothers and sisters of the household of faith are the ones that are are forming clicks and being mean and talking bad about the other one and and I didn't I can't comprehend the because I never went through that the very ones were supposed to be in Fellowship the very ones that are supposed to be our brothers and sisters the very ones that are supposed to Bear our burdens the very we we have young uh uh children uh uh eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirty that want to serve God with all of their heart and I want to tell you God bless you for that and you having the holy ghost or believing for the Holy Ghost you're going you're going to battle things where you're living you're not out in the workplace maybe you're not in a public school maybe you're not doing all those things but if you want the Holy Ghost to have true reign in your life be nice to your brothers and sisters be inclusive to them Fellowship around the world ask them what you can do for them invite them over look for that one that's always left on the outside I said oh God my heart started to hurt I thought I never went through that the very ones that are supposed to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ are cutting this one out and cutting that one out but I believe it's time it's maturing time it's even maturing time for our eight-year-olds and our nine-year-olds and our ten years to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to help you live where you're living if you only knew children how much you could set your own house on fire your Mom and Dad is working and struggling and fighting all these Spirits every day and doing their best to apply the token if you could just come in there with your Bibles hell Mama listen to this I really like this scripture oh if you only knew what that would do it would change the atmosphere it would change the situation we gotta be a body we got to be a group we got a discern spirits sometimes something comes your way and it's a test quickening power gives discernment here here David's going along a rejected King and that guy comes over and spits on David I think it's abishai says who is this dog gonna spit on my king I'm going to take his head off was right if you don't I'll do it first but see he was void David was anointed the spirit of Christ was upon David he said leave him alone because it was the word it was the spirit of discernment and that's what I'm moving towards is that that spirit that life would be moving in an action so I'm closing along these lines right here because I believe we can be uh being students of the Bible and the message and having Revelation and understanding about what the prophet is speaking of when we read this a revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for is that she can't do the great he works that she will be an invincible Army they did a true revelation of the two spirits and by God's spirit discern or withstand all of these things and and the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now I want to deal with this and just end on this note she will be an invincible Army if we're not careful we get a denominational idea just like the coming of the Lord we have an expectation a denominational way of thinking of how that's to be manifested if you want to know how that was to be manifested study the life of William Branham because it was the word right authenticating the New Testament it was the word made flesh and our generation making the Bible live God living out what he spoke through the prophet in his life the problem wasn't free from mistake he was a brother just like us but God was tutoring and training him bringing them to a place of maturity that he would be a Sheaf wave to a generation a first one to maturity but we've got so locked in on a denominational way of thinking of what it means to be an invincible Army and then the devil will take a denominational interpretation of that and make you think you're falling short now listen Invincible what's the definition of invincible Hallelujah Advanced only means incapable of being conquered now I want to say Jesus Christ what's the mighty conqueror but Jesus Christ was not the mighty conqueror because of only of what he did he opened the blind eyes he raised the dead he healed the sick he did all of those things but that's not the only thing that made him invincible that's not the only thing that made him the mighty conqueror what made him the mighty conqueror is also what he didn't do he was invincible because of what he didn't do that he was able to conquer his emotions he was able to conquer the pain he was able to conquer death think about it now he's hanging there on the cross oh my he's hanging there on the cross and they came there and they started wagging their heads at him yeah look at you you're the one that said I'll tear down this Temple and I'll Build It Up in three days why don't you come down off the cross others you saved but you yourself you can't save the prophet of God said that was the greatest compliment they could ever pay him he could have done it Ten Thousand Angels say the word my Lord say the word he could have come off that cross he didn't have to do it he made the decision oh thank you Lord thank you Lord and as he hung there what was represented to his left and his right he had an unbeliever on his left and a Believer on his right and I could just see him saying yeah I could come down but I'm not going because I got one hanging next to me I said Lord when you enter into your kingdom remember me see there's a fourth tree that day where Judas was hanging to take that scoffer and that other believer to hell but it was because of what Jesus Christ didn't do he didn't come off the cross he didn't give in to his emotions he didn't give in to the pain and the agony why because he was invincible he conquered his flesh it wasn't just only what he did it was because of what he didn't do Church stop looking at some big fantastic out there the fact that you're not giving in to Lady osia Hallelujah the fact that you're not giving in to the spirits the Antichrist Spirits working against the church the fact that you sisters are dressing holy and wearing your hair long and being a testimony the fact that you young Brothers aren't looking at all that uh fashion in them sexy dressed girls out there the things you're not doing you want to see an invincible Army it's the Bride of Jesus Christ that stops doing those things and running after all of those things the devil has out there to offer and stop running after those things and lay in the presence of the sun to bake all the greenness out of you it's not so much the things that you have to do but it's also the things that you're not doing that makes you invincible if the musicians would come that's discerning everyday Living Church the way you talk to your wife the way you conduct yourself at work the way you respond a reaction to an action the things you don't do in response waiting upon the Lord waiting on your ministry not running out somewhere not running after something it's the things you don't do that also make you an invincible Army Jesus Christ he was invincible he was the chief wave what is the sheath wave it's the first one to maturity he was invincible because of things he didn't do say brother Matthew what does that have to do with me well I'll tell you I tell you something you haven't done you haven't given up you could have given up a long time ago you could have thrown in the towel a long time ago with a heartache and the hurt and the trials that you went through you could have given up but what was it there was something inside of you a seed of God that's invincible it can't give up even when you give up you can't even sin because the seed of God remadeth in you what are you saying brother Matthew I'm saying you predestinated The Same Spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead the prophet of God said we are part of God The Offspring of God and he's the only Eternal thing there is amen you can no more die than God can die because you're Eternal with him Let It Come Hallelujah I'm kind of getting tired of this old pest house anyways if that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal body you are the Invincible Army you are the Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet of God said and identified Masterpiece would leave on this quote I am now identified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost not something out here on the street something 40 years ago I have it right now the glory and power of God of the Forgiveness of sins I seen him heal the sick open the blind eyes I've seen them foretail things read the hearts of the people I'm identified with him and his ministry at that day glory to God I'm identified with him for deliverance in this last day I trust to be a part of that great bride that's coming some of these days no matter what the world may say they may call us crazy hysterical beelzebubs Heretics whatever they want to I still want to be identified with that group I'm still here I'll remain there I was born there I want to stay there I'll always be there because God placed me there I am I left my church to come identify myself with a bunch of Holy Rollers I'm one of them I'm identified are you identified with that group not something 40 years ago don't identify me with the shock with something that's dried up dead and gone identify me with the grain identify me with pride time identify me with the Rapture identify me with the message identify me with the clown identify me with the prophet identify me with the same life that was in Jesus Christ now living and each one of you let's all stand [Music] identified by God's spirit to discern or withstand has to be revealed to you the prophet said God said how can you go look for something when you don't know what it is how do I know what I'm becoming well I've seen the chief wave [Music] testifying of all of the wheat seeds in the field I got good news it's Harvest Time where are them growing at where's that grain at where's it at basking in the presence of the Sun it's Harvest Time there's that green seed just let that old shuck keep pulling away your old intellectual mind your old ideas you thought you had it all figured out just just die out to that old shuck let the word discern the thought and tits of your heart and separate that you can lay in the presence of the Sun and bake all the greenness out cold Cornerstone we made strong [Music] sing that again [Music] the Cornerstone [Music] save yours yes [Music] before I turn it over to our pastor I just want to pray with you and give you an opportunity if you feel prayer would help you with every head bowed I am I realize more than ever before I need a revelation by God's spirit I need Revelation to be able to discern not just something of a church organization but something on a daily basis while you work and you raise your family and you have your relationships and you go to the job where you get into your car I want to move past the flesh Realm I want to move into a higher height I wanna I wanna Pierce through the unbelief I want to raise up in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and want to be in communion with him walking with him I see how sensitive the prophet was just a little breeze Lord is that you that's not too far from us Church that was an example that's how much God loves you he wants to walk with you he wants to hold your hand he wants to give you discernment that you know right from wrong maybe with your head bound if you feel the words dealt with your heart and you want prayer and you just want to lift your hand to him say Lord help me I need revelation I need Revelation by the spirit to give me discernment so no right from wrong to discern the two Spirits within the framework of my own life between my flesh and my desires between your word and your desires for my life Heavenly Father there's hands up everywhere Lord we want to love you more Lord we look at our humanity and we can become discouraged but thank you for your message thank you for your grace Lord thank you for your mercy thank you for this message Lord [Music] thank you for the revelation of justification Lord it'd be hard for many of us to keep going on but to know that you've forgiven us Lord but not only forgiven us you've Justified us as if we never did it in the first place that way when the devil tries to bring up our past we can even tell him I don't know what you're talking about because we're going back to Eden before the fall ever came oh that's how powerful this message is Lord we thank you for it Lord I commit all these that have lifted their hand to you pray that you give them Revelation by your spirit Lord deliver them from the things that have been hindering their walk with you [Music] Lord may your word just come to them and just start to break to them in such a supernatural way that it would change their lives it changed their countenance others would inquire of of the hope that lays within them because of the change that you've wrought in their life Lord I commit them to you now and Jesus Christ's name [Music] there are two roads if you need prayer we're here to pray for you as we turn it over to our pastor oh one bye I faith will take the word of God and what you see what you believe oh is [Music] thank you [Music] oh internet [Music] [Applause] [Music] questions [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's my grace [Music] tonight [Music] so beautifully laid out the message but there's a great secret that our rather share it with us tonight you know when you hear a message like this in your heart there's something in you that lets you know there's Higher Ground it it's not a word to say you're lacking this you're lacking that you're lacking this it's a word that says I've got this for you I've got this for you I've got this for you yes I've got victory for you I've got life for you come up to a higher ground you know don't be discouraged be encouraged that if there's something that in your soul beats and I I as brother Matthew is preaching I this scripture came on my heart look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in Christ now we always take that scripture and we go up to the first five verses but we need to take that scripture and go down to the next verse let this mind be in you that was in Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God amen that's what we want really when you think about it isn't it we want to be equal with the word and to be equal means there's no lacking yes right I mean if you have one cup and another cup and one's got full and the other one's not full it's not equal so what we want is we want everything that he is in us and when the word of God comes it doesn't it can I I just sat back listened to the whole sermon saying like I'm short of a lot of things I got a lot of growing to do I got a lot of maturing to do but thank God through the word of God I can obtain that which is in my heart [Music] never let don't ever condemnation for them who are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after God and who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God remains in them that's what our desire is Lord help me I need your spirit I need your grace I need your love I want to be everything that I hear in God's word that's what I want to be and I you're not telling me I'm short what you're telling me is I have more for you Lord that you're going to fill me up In The Same Spirit that was in you will be in me then as you are so can I be in this world that's my Pursuit father and I know those Matthew spoke I know the place that I'm going to receive the revelation to have that life you stored it up in a message father now I pray that I can see it for it personally unfold in my heart oh Church she's got so much for us he's got so much for us so much more than we could even think even ask even desire he's got so much for you do you feel tonight like he's got something for you you feel like he's got something he wants to give you you feel like he wants you to be victorious he's not condemning you for the problem you fight he's not condemning you for the sin that's so easily beset you he's sitting there saying I I want you to come up and you can grab a hold of it I love that man he finally fell down at Jesus is he Jesus said if thouks can believe and he finally looked at him and he fell down and grabbed His Garment and said Lord help my unbelief help me overcome Lord I warn you are hungry for it I'm thirsty for it amen you believe that amen think of that tonight there's two roads you can go two roads you can follow one by faith you can accept the things that you see or you can accept the things that says in his word let's play that first verse again if you would put it there for me to sing the first verse of the two roads there are two roads you may take one by sight that's what the word of God does doesn't it lets you sit there and see I'm short but there's one by faith I can obtain that which I'm short I can obtain that what I don't have praise God for that I'm predestinated to it it's mine I'm going to lay claim on it my healing everything about it I'm going to lay hold because it's mine and I can have it if I take the word of God or you can tell you what you see what you believe [Music] is what you'll believe if you believe the rich that you are then that's what you'll believe but if you believe what the word says you are that you that's quite a challenge of Faith isn't it to be able to look at yourself as a Spirit-filled love of God shed abroad in your heart oh I just think Matthew's calling to us tonight to come up to Higher Ground be more christ-like I think it's possible Lord help me tonight Lord I really need you I need you all in my life I need your leadership I need everything father that you have for me I I can't do it let me hear your voice raise it up in me father that I can grab it let me hear your voice of this age speak to me and keep calling me up Lord that's my heart's desire amen I'm not a very good singer but so I'll just turn it over and let Billy close with the song but foreign came on your heart tonight that wasn't a condemnation it was an invitation it wasn't a yeah wasn't a description it was a prescription amen we can rise to higher Heights and you can be the Christian you want to be because God said so amen oh there are two [Music] we'll take the word of God [Music] will be century [Music] [Music] oh it's my grace set your wings to the Wings of Faith oh watch your name watch your cry [Music] the word of God [Music] will tell me [Music] oh [Music] [Music]

presence Lord [Music] father that our desires have been expressed by the preaching of the word and for the word every word we heard our hearts cried out and said yes that's what I want to be yes

every day Lord in your presence Lord and father that we may come into that image of the perfect son and and we know only you can bring us into that image Lord and and we understand this by eating the
