[32:39] throne.
[32:41] [music] Oh, we're falling [singing]
[32:44] before
[32:45] your throne.
[32:48] Oh, and you [singing] are the one that
[32:52] we praise. [music]
[32:55] [singing] You are the one we adore. Oh,
[33:00] [music]
[33:02] you [singing] give the healing and grace
[33:05] [music]
[33:07] and hearts always. [singing]
[33:13] Oh, [singing and music] our hearts
[33:15] always come before.
[33:21] I
[33:23] was a rage.
[33:25] I remember who I [singing] was.
[33:30] I was [music] lost.
[33:32] I was [singing] blind.
[33:35] I was running [music]
[33:36] out of time.
[33:39] All sins
[33:42] separated.
[33:44] The bridge [music] was far too wide.
[33:48] From the far side of the castle,
[33:53] you held me [singing]
[33:55] in your side. Oh, you
[33:59] made a way [singing]
[34:02] across the [music] great fire. Oh, left
[34:06] behind [singing]
[34:08] heaven stone [music]
[34:10] to build it here inside. [singing]
[34:14] Oh, and there [music]
[34:16] at your cross.
[34:19] You paid the day I [music]
[34:22] You broke my chain,
[34:25] free my soul.
[34:27] For the first time I [music] had
[34:32] Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood
[34:38] of Christ. [music]
[34:40] Oh, thank you Jesus. You have washed
[34:46] [music] me.
[34:48] Oh, [singing] thank you Jesus. [music]
[34:53] You have saved [singing]
[34:54] my life.
[34:58] Draw me from the darkness
[35:01] into [music] glorious [singing]
[35:04] light.
[35:07] Oh, and you
[35:10] took my place [singing and music]
[35:12] and inside my chin.
[35:16] Oh, you [singing] were [music] buried
[35:18] for three days.
[35:27] The sea [music]
[35:30] life has
[35:34] for I have been [music]
[35:38] by the blood of the lamb.
[35:42] Thank you [music] Jesus
[35:46] for the blood [singing]
[35:48] of
[35:51] thank you Jesus [music]
[35:55] [singing]
[35:57] me.
[35:59] Thank [music] you Jesus
[36:04] [singing] in my life
[36:08] [music and singing] from the darkness
[36:11] to glorious.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Lord, we so
[36:18] thankful for your
[36:20] your call upon our life.
[36:26] Lord, we see the the darkness and the
[36:31] the strain on the people of this age and
[36:33] how they are looking for financial
[36:37] freedom and
[36:39] position and
[36:42] to store up treasures in this earth that
[36:45] we know is all going to burn and pass
[36:48] away.
[36:50] Lord, to think that you called us to be
[36:52] a part of another kingdom,
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, where we don't have to put our joy
[36:57] and our satisfaction
[36:59] in our job or in our car or in our house
[37:02] or
[37:04] our ability to manufacture something.
[37:08] Lord, you called us to believe your
[37:10] word.
[37:12] And you've given us a promise, Lord,
[37:13] that everything is already taken care of
[37:16] and that we have an inheritance.
[37:19] And all we have to do is simply believe
[37:21] what you've said and receive it. And we
[37:24] know that we can walk into all the
[37:25] promises that you've given unto us,
[37:27] Lord. And we just thank you for Calvary.
[37:30] We thank you for the sacrifice, Lord, of
[37:33] [snorts] that would wash us white as
[37:36] snow that we could stand before you, not
[37:38] having to worry about [music] our past
[37:40] and not having to wonder if it was dealt
[37:43] with, Lord, but to know it's finished
[37:45] because you said it was finished.
[37:47] Therefore, Lord, we can we can enjoy uh
[37:50] the beneficiaries of your resurrection.
[37:52] And we just thank you for this
[37:54] opportunity to stand once again, Lord,
[37:57] before your purchased possession. We
[37:59] never take it for granted. We never take
[38:00] it lightly, Lord. And we just look to
[38:03] you, the author and finisher of our
[38:04] faith, that you would just come and have
[38:06] your perfect will in the service. We ask
[38:09] it in your name, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:12] Amen. Amen. Just want to say what a
[38:14] tremendous blessing it is to have uh
[38:17] Brother Cosman and Sister Holly and
[38:19] their family with us. how much uh they
[38:22] mean to us and we're uh looking forward
[38:26] to eternity. You know, uh God brings
[38:29] certain ones into our life and into the
[38:31] assembly and they mean so much to us.
[38:33] Yet, you know, we're we're prisoners of
[38:35] Jesus Christ and we're here to serve and
[38:38] one of these days, you know, we'll we'll
[38:40] have a million plus years to talk it all
[38:42] over. So, while we're on this side, we
[38:44] just want to be faithful to the calling.
[38:46] So, we're thankful that uh brother
[38:48] Cosman was obedient uh to the leadership
[38:50] of the Lord and doing a work there in
[38:52] southern Romania. Uh wonderful people
[38:54] there, but there is a great need. So,
[38:56] just remember him in prayer as uh uh him
[38:59] and his family continue to serve the
[39:01] bride of Jesus Christ in that region. I
[39:03] just want to maybe pick up where he left
[39:05] off. We'll just read in Ephesians
[39:07] chapter 1.
[39:09] Just see how the Lord would lead in this
[39:11] service tonight. Um, you know, I won't
[39:14] say much other than it it somehow fell
[39:16] my lot. And sometimes, uh, [snorts] you
[39:20] know, I was talking to brother Billy. I
[39:21] was like, well, you know, if if, uh, if
[39:24] if if
[39:26] we preached when we wanted to, none of
[39:28] us would ever preach.
[39:30] You know, it's it's I don't think out of
[39:32] the brothers here, none of us are going
[39:34] to be like, "Yeah, I'm that guy." But,
[39:37] uh, we just want to be faithful when
[39:39] when when asked. And so, uh, we're just,
[39:42] uh, I just remember one time, uh,
[39:47] you know, it it always strikes me, but
[39:49] my brother Aaron asked me to preach one
[39:51] time on a Wednesday night and and I and
[39:53] I just I wasn't I just didn't feel
[39:56] ready. I didn't I didn't feel prepared
[39:58] and and I I tried to find the mind of
[40:01] the Lord and not to get into what his
[40:04] perfect will was for that night or not.
[40:06] But I just remember in that turmoil, I
[40:08] finally just said, "I can't do it." And
[40:10] it wasn't but 20 minutes till service. I
[40:12] told my brother Aaron, I was like, you
[40:13] know, I I I just can't do it. And but it
[40:15] it smoked my heart because I thought,
[40:17] you know, here here my brother, he he he
[40:20] travels around the world and preaches
[40:21] the gospel and and labors for the
[40:24] kingdom of God and and maybe maybe I had
[40:27] an opportunity to carry the load a
[40:29] little bit and I wasn't able to do it.
[40:32] And from [laughter] that moment, I just
[40:33] said, "Lord, I always want to be
[40:34] willing. I might not be ready. I might
[40:38] not be able, Lord, but I just want to
[40:40] have a willing heart. And and so that's
[40:43] that's been my my [laughter] burden is
[40:45] to just be willing. And uh sometimes you
[40:49] might not feel like you do much, but one
[40:51] thing you want to know is Lord, I did it
[40:53] for you. I just try to do my part. And
[40:55] so we just trust the Lord will come and
[40:58] have his way. Ephesians 1 and verse
[41:01] 5-14.
[41:03] Amen. I enjoyed the word this morning.
[41:04] Did you all enjoy that?
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful for the reading of
[41:08] the will. [snorts] And uh brother Cosman
[41:10] just ended right here. So we're just
[41:12] picking up Ephesians 1 and verse 5 uh
[41:16] through uh verse 14. It says, "Having
[41:20] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[41:22] children
[41:24] uh by Jesus Christ to himself according
[41:27] to the good pleasure of his will, to the
[41:30] praise of the glory of his grace,
[41:31] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[41:34] beloved, and whom we have redemption
[41:36] through his blood, and the forgiveness
[41:37] of sins, according to the riches of his
[41:40] grace, wherein he hath abounded toward
[41:43] us in all wisdom and prudence, having
[41:45] made known unto us the mystery of his
[41:48] will according to his good pleasure
[41:50] which he hath purposed in himself,
[41:54] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[41:57] of times, that he might gather together
[42:00] one and all things in Christ, both which
[42:02] are in heaven and which are in earth,
[42:04] even in him, in whom also we have
[42:07] obtained an inheritance, being
[42:10] predestinated according to the purpose
[42:12] of him who workketh all things after the
[42:15] counsel of his own will. Aren't you
[42:17] thankful for that? That we should be to
[42:20] the praise of his glory, who first
[42:22] trusted in Christ, in whom ye also
[42:25] trusted after that ye have heard the
[42:27] word of truth, the gospel of your
[42:29] salvation, and whom also after that ye
[42:31] believed, ye were sealed with the Holy
[42:34] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[42:37] of our inheritance until the redemption
[42:40] of the purchased possession under the
[42:42] praise of his glory. Amen. You may be
[42:45] seated. As we we just heard uh this
[42:48] morning, we could even turn over into
[42:49] Isaiah 60 and read how uh there is gross
[42:53] darkness upon the people and gross
[42:56] darkness upon the land, but arise and
[42:58] shine for thy light has come and the
[43:01] glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[43:04] And we certainly can look out and we can
[43:07] see that, you know, the world is in such
[43:09] a chaotic time. And and the prophet
[43:11] would even preach shalom and start to
[43:13] show how, you know, the world is right
[43:15] back in that condition again to where
[43:17] there's gross darkness upon the people
[43:20] and it's in a chaotic condition. And and
[43:22] certainly we can see that if you just
[43:24] look out into the news or look out into
[43:26] the politics or or or just go down to
[43:28] your local supermarket and you'll
[43:29] certainly see the chaos, the confusion,
[43:32] the insanity just running rampant
[43:34] everywhere. But it's amazing that right
[43:36] in what would be called the darkest hour
[43:38] and the darkest age and the darkest time
[43:40] that the world has ever seen. It is also
[43:42] the time of the greatest light. Now, now
[43:45] to think it is a paradox to think in the
[43:48] hour that that it is the most gross
[43:51] darkness that the world has ever seen.
[43:53] Right in the midst of Lady Oia and the
[43:56] and the grossest darkness that's ever
[43:58] been upon of the world, there is a
[44:01] people that has been called that has
[44:03] actually come under the greatest light
[44:05] that the world has ever known. And you
[44:08] know what? What an opportunity that we
[44:10] have to think that there is a people
[44:12] that we have received the greatest light
[44:14] that that has ever shown. And and and we
[44:16] know that that light is Jesus Christ.
[44:18] And to reject him is to reject the
[44:21] light. It's to reject his word. And and
[44:23] you know, if you reject him, it's it's
[44:25] to re to receive him is life. And to
[44:27] reject him is
[44:29] it it it's death. And you know, we know
[44:31] that that this message, he is the word.
[44:34] And and his word is a seed. And the life
[44:36] is in the seed. And and and what we are
[44:39] finding out more and more is that very
[44:41] word is a seed and it's inside each one
[44:43] of us each inside of each one of his
[44:45] believing children. And brother Brandon
[44:47] would say it this way in the great
[44:48] warrior David. He said because the life
[44:50] is in the seed and God's word is a seed
[44:53] and it's alive. If you can just simply
[44:55] receive it take it out of the Bible and
[44:58] said it means me. Amen. Then you got
[45:01] something. That's right. All the demons
[45:02] couldn't stop you from it. No matter
[45:04] what anybody else would say, you
[45:06] wouldn't believe it because you know
[45:08] where you are standing. Oh, I want to be
[45:10] a people that I I want to know exactly
[45:13] where I am standing. I want to be sure
[45:15] of who I am in the hour that I am
[45:17] standing in. And and and you know,
[45:19] really that's the tactic of the devil.
[45:21] HE WANTS TO TRY TO GET YOU DISCOURAGED
[45:22] and he wants you to TRY TO DOUBT AND HE
[45:24] HE WANTS TO GET YOU TO WORRY and and he
[45:26] wants to move you off THE PROMISES OF
[45:27] GOD TO TO REALLY GET YOU TO A PLACE
[45:29] WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
[45:30] STANDING.
[45:32] He he he wants to get you to a place
[45:33] WHERE YOU START TO QUESTION WHO YOU ARE
[45:35] and and maybe the hour that we're now
[45:37] living in and make you think that maybe
[45:39] we got more time AND AND KNOW IT JUST
[45:41] STRIKES ME HERE RECENTLY I I was uh uh
[45:44] fellowshipping with a with a friend of
[45:45] mine who who's just receiving the word
[45:47] and God's doing a supernatural work in
[45:49] his life and I'm so thankful for that.
[45:51] and and he he's coming in contact with
[45:53] people, you know, that have have claimed
[45:54] to be Christians all of their lives and
[45:56] a and you know, and he's like, "Oh, you
[45:58] know, you the reason you're, you know,
[46:00] you're doing good is cuz we've prayed
[46:01] for you and WE PRAYED FOR UH this in
[46:03] YOUR LIFE." BUT HE'S HE'S sitting there
[46:05] looking at them and he said, "Yeah, BUT
[46:06] YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE THE FRUITS
[46:08] of the word in your life." And so he
[46:10] starts TO ASK THEM AND QUESTION THEM AND
[46:12] THEY TELL THEM, "WELL, YOU KNOW, you
[46:13] know, you know, Kyle, you it doesn't
[46:15] matter. You know, just just just look
[46:18] look into the Bible at the thief on the
[46:20] cross. YOU KNOW, ALLS HE HAD TO SAY WAS
[46:22] REMEMBER ME. And what he was doing, he
[46:24] was making his own religion that I can
[46:26] live any way that I want to live. And
[46:28] and you know, I I can go to church on
[46:30] Sunday and I can GO TO CHURCH ON ON
[46:32] Wednesday or man, they don't even do
[46:34] that once a year. Go on Easter. It
[46:36] doesn't matter. Just as long as
[46:37] somewhere down the line, I say,
[46:38] "Remember me, Lord."
[46:41] And it's a shame that people will get to
[46:43] a place to where, you know, they they
[46:45] they they think they know where they're
[46:48] standing, but they're totally blind. And
[46:50] just as the condition of the age,
[46:52] they're they're wretched, miserable, and
[46:54] blind. And what they don't even know it.
[46:55] They think they have need of nothing.
[46:57] They think that just SAYING THEY GO TO
[46:59] CHURCH ONCE A week is just enough. AND I
[47:02] TELL YOU, WE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT
[47:03] WE DON'T FALL INTO THE SAME CATEGORY OF
[47:05] THAT STRAIN on the age where we think
[47:07] that we're we're pretty rich and
[47:09] increased with knowledge AND
[47:10] UNDERSTANDING OF THE MESSAGE OF THE
[47:12] HOUR. And you know, I really don't got
[47:14] need of nothing. I have everything I
[47:15] HAVE NEED OF. I I I HAVE THE MESSAGE OF
[47:17] THE HOUR. WELL, there's a lot of truth
[47:19] to that. But what you WANT TO DO IS
[47:21] EXAMINE your life and see if the message
[47:23] of the hour is living out through you if
[47:25] you're bearing the fruits of the word.
[47:27] And hey, I I say it's ALWAYS GOOD TO
[47:29] CHECK UP AND LOOK INTO THE WORD BECAUSE
[47:31] BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN TOLD US AND TAUGHT
[47:33] US. HE GOES, "WELL, you want to see look
[47:34] at what he did and look at what you're
[47:36] doing and SEE WHAT YOU GOT." WELL, I
[47:38] TELL YOU, THERE OUGHT TO BE ALWAYS A
[47:39] SOBRIETY AND A SINCERITY in the heart of
[47:42] the BELIEVING CHILDREN OF GOD TO BE
[47:44] FEEDING on the word of God AND LOOKING
[47:46] AT THE LIFE. I SAY I PRAISE GOD FOR A
[47:49] LIFE THAT WAS poured out for us uh uh uh
[47:52] uh through MALACHI 4:5 THAT WAS WAS AN
[47:54] OPEN BOOK uh uh a a and and and shared
[47:57] all the life experiences and and I tell
[48:00] you we needed that because what WAS IT
[48:02] DOING? IT WAS SHOWING US THE EFFECT OF
[48:05] THE WORD in a believer's life in the day
[48:08] and the hour that we're now living IN
[48:09] AND HOW IT FINE-TUNES ON DOWN TO WHERE
[48:12] YOU KNOW YOU COULD JUST ANSWER A PHONE
[48:14] AND SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST
[48:15] GOING TO STEP OUT a little bit." BUT THE
[48:16] BUT THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS THERE TO TO SHOW
[48:18] HIM, LOOK, you can't continue that way.
[48:21] I can't continue working through you and
[48:24] BEARING THE FRUITS OF MY WORD IN YOUR
[48:26] LIFE. YOU GOT TO GO MAKE THAT RIGHT. And
[48:28] to think if if IT WAS THAT FINE-TUNED
[48:30] DOWN TO WHERE JUST A LITTLE MISREP
[48:32] misrepresentation
[48:34] where, you know, YOU COULD JUSTIFY it
[48:36] all you want. You could say, WELL, YOU
[48:37] KNOW, HE REALLY WASN'T. HE HE DID SAY,
[48:38] "WELL, TELL HIM I'M not here." And go
[48:41] out and what? He wasn't there.
[48:44] And I wonder how MANY THINGS ARE WE
[48:46] DOING and thinking that we're getting by
[48:48] with
[48:52] &gt;&gt; and and yet we want to say, "WELL, YEAH,
[48:54] WE ARE THE ONES. We're going to do the
[48:56] great." Well, yes, we believe all those
[48:58] things, but something THAT'S BEEN ON MY
[48:59] HEART THAT I WAS FEEDING ON AND BEEN
[49:01] LISTENING to to LATELY IS BROTHER
[49:03] BRANDON PREACHES A MESSAGE CALLED
[49:04] SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. And if it if we're
[49:07] not careful, WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE
[49:09] FORGET WHO WE ARE. AND FOR WE FORGET
[49:11] what the message OF THE HOUR WAS
[49:13] SUPPOSED to produce in a believer.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; You know, it it's it's exactly what we
[49:18] heard this morning and and WHAT THE
[49:20] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR SAID AND WHAT PAUL
[49:22] TAUGHT. YOU KNOW, WE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL
[49:24] THE MYSTERIES. WE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL
[49:25] THESE THINGS, BUT WHAT PROFITED US IF WE
[49:28] DON'T HAVE LOVE? IF WE DON'T HAVE
[49:29] charity
[49:32] &gt;&gt; and if we if we're not careful, we start
[49:34] to lean towards towards understanding
[49:36] and and and a and and maybe our routine
[49:40] of of coming to church and and if we're
[49:43] not careful, we start to see that the
[49:44] word is not having an effect in our life
[49:46] like it should. And here in our text in
[49:49] Ephesians 1:5, it says, "HAVING
[49:51] PREDESTINATED US unto the adoption of
[49:54] children BY JESUS CHRIST to himself
[49:57] according to the good pleasure of whose
[50:00] will?"
[50:01] &gt;&gt; His will. SO WHAT ARE WE PREDESTINATED
[50:04] UNTO?
[50:06] &gt;&gt; ADOPTION.
[50:08] I'm not looking for adoption to come
[50:10] down the road. I believe right now I am
[50:13] living in adoption.
[50:15] you know, AND I COULD TESTIFY ON THAT A
[50:18] WHILE HERE A WHILE BACK. I WAS READING
[50:20] out of Galatians where, you know, we've
[50:22] received the spirit of adoption, and I
[50:24] just spoke out of my mouth. I said, "I
[50:26] AM AN ADOPTED SON OF GOD." WELL, you
[50:29] know, I SPOKE THAT WORD OUT AND LITTLE
[50:31] DID I KNOW THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WALK INTO
[50:33] THE GREATEST TRIAL THAT I'd ever walked
[50:36] into my life. BUT, YOU KNOW, UH, ANY
[50:38] REVELATION THAT YOU RECEIVE, YOU'RE
[50:40] GOING TO BE TESTED ON THAT REVELATION.
[50:43] AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU BETTER KNOW
[50:44] WHERE YOU ARE STANDING BECAUSE YOUR MIND
[50:47] CAN SEEM to lose you and EVERYTHING CAN
[50:49] CAN SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT RIGHT AND AND
[50:52] THIS MIGHT NOT LOOK right and that might
[50:53] look right. But oh, praise the Lord. IF
[50:55] THERE'S A REVELATION, IF THERE'S AN
[50:57] ANCHOR INSIDE OF YOUR HEART AND AN
[50:59] ANCHOR INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL, IT DOESN'T
[51:01] MATTER WHAT COMES. ONE THING YOU KNOW
[51:03] THAT I HAVE HEARD the word OF THE LORD
[51:06] AND IT HAS BEEN QUICKENED IN MY SOUL AND
[51:08] I KNOW WHERE I am standing. And I might
[51:10] not be able to make sense of this AND
[51:12] THAT AND AND THIS HAPPENED AND THAT
[51:14] HAPPENED. But one THING I AM SURE OF, I
[51:16] KNOW WHERE I am standing.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I say it's really important that we know
[51:22] where we are standing. Isn't that what
[51:24] he said? No matter what anybody would
[51:26] say, you wouldn't believe it
[51:29] because we know where you are standing.
[51:31] So many times people get into a place of
[51:33] spiritual AMNESIA BECAUSE UH SITUATIONS,
[51:37] RIGHT? and and and and maybe uh it COULD
[51:40] BE SOME SOME UH FAMILY TRAUMA OR
[51:42] SOMETHING HAPPENED. YOU COULD GO INTO
[51:44] THAT MESSAGE AND SEE HOW THE SHOCK OF
[51:46] WAR and the shock of sin. What will it
[51:47] do? It'll cause amnesia. AND SOMETIMES
[51:50] WE FORGET who we are. And many times
[51:52] people come for prayer and they need
[51:54] deliverance. And really all they need is
[51:56] they just need to be delivered from
[51:57] their spiritual amnesia. They they they
[52:00] have forgotten who they are. are. And
[52:01] and WHEN YOU START TO FORGET who you are
[52:04] and that YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD AND THAT
[52:05] YOU CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS AND YOU CAN
[52:08] DO ALL THINGS, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU START
[52:09] TO QUESTION YOUR SALVATION, YOU START TO
[52:11] QUESTION THE HOLY GHOST. YOU START TO
[52:13] WONDER, WELL, IF IT it's really me. AND
[52:16] REALLY, WHAT YOU'RE STARTING TO DO IS
[52:17] YOU'RE STARTING TO OPEN UP A door for
[52:19] reasoning to come in and doubt to come
[52:21] in. And then all of a sudden, the
[52:23] worries in THERE, AND YOU'RE CAUGHT
[52:24] BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS, and you're
[52:26] starting TO WONDER, WELL, WHY WHY
[52:28] WHERE'S THE JOY OF MY SALVATION? AND AND
[52:30] WHY AM I DOING THIS? AND IF YOU'RE NOT
[52:32] CAREFUL, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE YOU'RE
[52:33] YOU'RE MENTALLY fatigued and and the
[52:36] strain is so much. So you you MIGHT AS
[52:37] WELL JUST WATCH A LITTLE OF THIS AND
[52:39] FEED ON A LITTLE OF THIS. AND ALL OF A
[52:40] SUDDEN ONE DAY YOU WONDER, "HOW IN THE
[52:42] WORLD DID I GET TO WHERE I'M AT? I don't
[52:44] even know if I'm a SON OR DAUGHTER OF
[52:46] GOD ANYMORE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DON'T
[52:48] KNOW WHAT I AM." AND MAYBE YOU COME UP
[52:49] FOR PRAYER. AND MANY TIMES WHAT THE WORD
[52:51] the the the word of the Lord is I it's
[52:54] to deliver you FROM THAT SPIRITUAL
[52:56] AMNESIA BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN
[52:58] did you become A SON OF GOD? WHEN DID
[53:00] YOU BECOME A DAUGHTER OF GOD?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Oh I love it. WE CAN GO BACK IN
[53:06] EPHESIANS. I JUST LOVE IT HOW IT SAYS IN
[53:09] IN verse four it says according HE AS HE
[53:11] HAS CHOSEN us in him before.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; When did you BECOME A SON? YOU ALWAYS
[53:18] WERE A SON. YOU ALWAYS WERE A DAUGHTER.
[53:21] THEREFORE, BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON AND A
[53:22] DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU CAN BE REBORN.
[53:25] BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON OR A DAUGHTER OF
[53:27] GOD, THEREFORE, YOU CAN BE QUICKENED.
[53:29] THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER YOU'RE A SON
[53:30] OF GOD. THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER
[53:32] YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF GOD. THE QUESTION
[53:33] IS, ARE YOU GOING TO START STANDING UP
[53:35] FOR WHAT YOU really are and say, "I am
[53:37] the BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I CAN DO THE
[53:40] GREATER WORKS AND I DO KNOW WHERE I'M
[53:42] STANDING, and there ain't no devil.
[53:44] There ain't no demon going to talk me
[53:46] out of my divine inheritance. I have
[53:48] been PREDESTINATED UNTO ADOPTION.
[53:50] ADOPTION IS NOT AN OPTION.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Adoption is not an option. IT AIN'T AN
[53:56] OPTION TO US BELIEVERS. YOU'RE
[53:58] PREDESTINATED TO AN UH TO ADOPTION if
[54:01] you can.
[54:03] If you can come to church three times a
[54:05] week, if you CAN GET THERE 20 MINUTES
[54:07] EARLY, I I then I will. NO, YOU ARE
[54:10] PRED. WELL, THAT MEANS THERE AIN'T NO
[54:12] DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN STOP YOU FROM
[54:15] COMING INTO THE FULLNESS OF THE MATURITY
[54:16] OF THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN FOR THE
[54:19] HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. AND I WONDER
[54:20] is there are PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHERE THEY
[54:22] ARE STANDING THAT THEY CAN TELL THAT OLD
[54:24] DEVIL, THAT OLD DEMON, YOU COME A LITTLE
[54:26] TOO LATE. I'VE DONE HEARD FROM MY
[54:28] THEOPHONY. I KNOW WHO I AM and I know
[54:31] where I AM GOING. I AM THE PREDESTINATED
[54:34] SON OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND I CAN DO THE
[54:37] GREATER WORKS. I'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED
[54:40] UNTO ADOPTION. IT IS NOT JUST AN OPTION.
[54:43] IT IS MY INHERITANCE.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; WELL, shake yourself a little bit
[54:47] tonight. MAYBE WE'VE PUT SOMETHING OFF
[54:49] ON the rainbow in a pot of GOLD SOMEWAY
[54:51] YONDER AND WE'RE WAITING FOR SOME BIG
[54:53] CALAMITY or we're waiting for SOMETHING
[54:55] TO COME OR WE'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING
[54:57] TO COME IN THE FUTURE. BUT I TELL YOU
[54:59] WHAT, MAYBE WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
[55:01] SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. WE NEED TO WAKE UP
[55:03] AND WE NEED TO SHAKE OURSEL AND
[55:05] UNDERSTAND THE CAPSTONE HAS ALREADY
[55:07] DESCENDED. WE HAVE HEARD THE SHOUT. WE
[55:09] HAVE HEARD FROM OUR THEOPHONY. NOW IS
[55:12] THE HOUR of the manifestation of the
[55:14] sons and daughters of God.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; It it's a promise and I want to say it's
[55:24] a promise of what the seed word will
[55:26] produce in you.
[55:30] and and and there ain't nothing that can
[55:32] keep you from it. What we need to do is
[55:34] receive it
[55:36] &gt;&gt; no matter what anybody else says.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Well, help me help me out a little bit.
[55:44] Does anybody know where you're standing?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; You can say, you know what? I don't
[55:49] listen to worldly music.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; I don't entertain the things of the
[55:54] world. Now, HERE BECOMES A GREAT
[55:57] PARADOX. We'll just hit on this for a
[55:59] little bit maybe uh uh uh you know just
[56:01] to maybe bring it down home to where
[56:03] sometimes we're living you know
[56:05] sometimes we're entertaining things we
[56:07] shouldn't entertain
[56:12] &gt;&gt; now we have to remind ourselves you know
[56:16] what
[56:18] I'm a son and daughter of God I
[56:21] shouldn't be doing that
[56:23] &gt;&gt; sir
[56:24] &gt;&gt; and you know the prophet talks about you
[56:26] he's he's not just going to SHOVE YOU
[56:28] THROUGH A PIPE AND PULL YOU OUT ON THE
[56:30] OTHER END and say, "Well done, my good
[56:32] AND FAITHFUL SERVANT." YEAH, THERE'S A
[56:33] MIGHTY DELIVERANCE and God will deliver
[56:35] you of A LOT OF THINGS, BUT YOU REMEMBER
[56:37] THERE'S A YOU GOT TO KEEP YOURSELF
[56:38] PROTECTED because there's always a punch
[56:40] coming. MAY MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S LOST.
[56:42] MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S MUSIC, MAYBE YOUR
[56:45] BATTLE'S A TEMPER, MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S
[56:46] SOMETHING ELSE. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU,
[56:48] YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THERE'S ALWAYS A
[56:50] GIANT that's wandering around in the
[56:52] land. AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP
[56:54] AGAINST THAT THING. And you know what
[56:55] you're going to have to do? you're going
[56:56] to have to be do battle. And that's one
[56:58] thing I love about Da uh David in this
[57:00] IN IN THE BIBLE. HE KNEW WHERE HE was
[57:02] standing when he came face TO FACE WITH
[57:04] GOLIATH. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WONDER, WELL,
[57:06] YOU KNOW WHAT? AM I CALLED TO FIGHT? AM
[57:09] I SHOULD I GO FIGHT THIS this this THIS
[57:11] GOLIATH? YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. NO, HE
[57:13] HAD ALREADY heard the word of a prophet.
[57:16] A prophet HAD ALREADY COME AND anointed
[57:18] David and said, "David, you are anointed
[57:20] the COMING KING OF ISRAEL." DAVID KNEW
[57:23] WHERE HE WAS STANDING. THUS SAYETH
[57:24] [screaming] THE LORD ACCORDING TO A
[57:26] VINDICATED PROPHET, I AM THE ANOINTED
[57:28] ONE OF GOD, AND I SHALL BE THE KING over
[57:31] Israel. So there ain't no Goliath.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; There was nothing Goliath COULD DO TO
[57:38] STOP DAVID BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY
[57:40] PROPHESIED. HE WAS ALREADY ANOINTED FOR
[57:43] THE JOB. ALL HE WAS DOING IS TAKING DOWN
[57:45] EVERY GIANT AND EVERY DEMON OF DOUBT
[57:48] THAT GOT IN HIS WAY. WHAT ABOUT THE
[57:50] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST? IF THERE'S A
[57:51] GOLIATH STANDING IN YOUR WAY, I DON'T
[57:53] CARE IF it's temper, IF IT'S LUST, IF
[57:56] IT'S COUNTRY MUSIC, WHATEVER IT IS, WHEN
[57:58] IT STARTS TO BOAST AND TRY TO TELL YOU,
[58:00] SEE, YOU AIN'T GOT THE VICTORY. YOU
[58:02] AIN'T REALLY GOING TO THE BRIDE OF
[58:03] CHRIST. YOU'LL NEVER GET THE VICTORY
[58:04] OVER THIS. YOU JUST SAY, YOU OLD
[58:06] GOLIATH, YOU'VE BOASTED ABOUT YOUR GODS,
[58:09] BUT I AM OF THE LORD GOD OF THE FAITH OF
[58:11] ISRAEL, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR HEAD
[58:13] OFF. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GOT TO
[58:15] TAKE THE WORD OF GOD, AND YOU GOT TO HIT
[58:17] THAT DEVIL SQUARE BETWEEN THE EYES.
[58:22] HEY, maybe we're getting down home to
[58:24] where we're living,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; BUT SO MANY TIMES WE GET SPIRITUAL
[58:29] AMNESIA and we start, well, that's just
[58:30] the way it is. No, that that's not the
[58:33] way it is.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I SAY WE GOT TO BE SURE OF WHERE WE'RE
[58:37] STANDING BECAUSE SATAN'S ALWAYS TRYING
[58:39] TO MOVE YOU OFF THE PROMISES, ALWAYS
[58:41] TRYING TO OFFER AN EXCUSE, ALWAYS TRYING
[58:42] TO OFFER REASONING, ALWAYS TRYING TO
[58:44] EVEN OFFER ACHIEVEMENTS. But my Bible in
[58:47] Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are
[58:49] you saved through faith, and that not of
[58:51] yourselves. IT IS A GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF
[58:53] WORKS, lest any man should boast.
[58:57] For we are his workmanship, created in
[58:59] Christ Jesus under good works, WHICH GOD
[59:01] HATH BE OR BEFORE ordained that we
[59:04] should walk in THEM. LOOK, YOU THE VERY
[59:06] FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR life have been ordered
[59:08] of the Lord."
[59:10] &gt;&gt; What were we hearing this morning? It's
[59:11] the reading of the wheel. IT'S TELLING
[59:13] YOU WHAT your will is for your life.
[59:16] WHAT THE INHERITANCE OF YOUR LIFE IS. SO
[59:18] THEN WHAT WE'RE TO do is to look into
[59:20] the message of the hour to hear the
[59:22] message of the hour and to look at our
[59:24] life and to see IS ARE WE MANIFESTING
[59:27] what the reading OF THE WHEEL HAS SPOKEN
[59:30] OUT OVER OUR LIFE. AND IF you see things
[59:32] that aren't part OF YOUR INHERITANCE, I
[59:34] SAY let it go. AND LET'S TAKE GOD AT HIS
[59:37] WORD AND SAY, LORD, it's mine.
[59:41] We know that Christ was the word made
[59:43] flesh.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was fulfilling all
[59:47] that the word had spoke of him.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:52] &gt;&gt; We know that Christ was the word made
[59:54] flesh and he was fulfilling all the word
[59:56] that was spoke of him.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; So then JUST AS CHRIST WAS THE WORD made
[1:00:03] flesh and he was fulfilling ALL THE
[1:00:05] WORDS OF THE PROPHETS, NOW WHAT are we?
[1:00:08] We are bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:00:10] flesh. And what are we doing? Just as he
[1:00:13] WAS THE ANOINTED MESSIAH, NOW WE ARE THE
[1:00:16] anointed word. And what are we doing?
[1:00:18] WE'RE FULFILLING ALL the word that was
[1:00:20] spoken of us.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "As the father sent me, so
[1:00:25] send I you."
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; And if he was the anointed word for that
[1:00:30] day, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "HIS BRIDE
[1:00:33] IS THE ANOINTED one for this day." OH,
[1:00:36] I'M TELLING YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING. We're
[1:00:37] hearing the reading OF THE WILL OF GOD
[1:00:40] FOR OUR LIFE. WE ARE NOT SOME
[1:00:42] WISHYWASHY, SPINELESS, BACKBONELESS
[1:00:45] BRIDE OF CHRIST WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE
[1:00:46] SHE'S STANDING. AND WE'RE JUST PUSHED
[1:00:48] THIS WAY AND PUSHED THAT WAY. AND WHEN
[1:00:50] LUST COMES ALONG, WE JUST GIVE IN IT.
[1:00:52] WHEN WE hear music, WE JUST THUMP OUR
[1:00:54] FEET TO IT. And and and WHEN THE DEVIL
[1:00:56] STARTS TO RISE UP IN OUR FAMILY'S LIFE,
[1:00:58] WE JUST SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, LET ME
[1:01:00] CALL THE DOCTOR. LET ME CALL THE
[1:01:02] PASTOR." NO, I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE
[1:01:04] OUGHT TO BE A PEOPLE HERE. WE know
[1:01:05] exactly WHERE WE ARE STANDING. WHEN THAT
[1:01:07] DEVIL STARTS TO SHOW HIS FACE INTO OUR
[1:01:09] LIFE AND INTO WHERE WE'RE LIVING, THERE
[1:01:11] OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING HE SAYS, "DEVIL,
[1:01:13] YOU BACK UP IN THE NAME OF THE LORD
[1:01:15] JESUS CHRIST. I AM A SON OF GOD. I HAVE
[1:01:18] FULL AUTHORITY AND FULL POWER AND
[1:01:20] DOMINION OVER YOU. GET OUT OF MY WAY."
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; We could go in the church AGE BOOK WHERE
[1:01:29] THE PROPHET OF GOD STARTS TALKING ABOUT
[1:01:31] HOW HE DIDN'T COMPLETE ALL OF HIS WORK
[1:01:33] WHILE HE WAS IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY. So
[1:01:35] now he's working in and through the
[1:01:37] bride. And she knows this. For it was
[1:01:39] not yet time FOR HIM TO DO CERTAIN
[1:01:41] THINGS THAT HE MUST DO NOW. But he will
[1:01:44] now fulfill THROUGH THE BRIDE THAT WORK
[1:01:46] which he left for this SPECIFIC TIME.
[1:01:50] DID YOU KNOW YOU GOT A JOB TO DO? SOME
[1:01:52] OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND YOU'VE
[1:01:53] ALREADY BEEN GIVEN a spiritual job.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you would start giving more
[1:02:00] diligence to your spiritual job, you
[1:02:02] might end up with a natural job.
[1:02:05] SOMETIMES WE GIVE SO MUCH TIME AND WE
[1:02:07] GIVE SO MUCH ATTENTION AND WE GIVE SO
[1:02:10] MUCH OF our efforts to the things of the
[1:02:12] world that the very thing that you're
[1:02:14] called to to to to live out you you
[1:02:17] DON'T GIVE ANY TIME AND ATTENTION TO IT.
[1:02:19] I I wonder if the amount of time you YOU
[1:02:21] YOU SPEND STUDYING for for for for you
[1:02:24] you KNOW TO PASS YOUR TEST or or if you
[1:02:26] spend to do this or that OR ALL THE TIME
[1:02:28] you you you spend on LinkedIn and all
[1:02:30] this. My goodness, if you just spend it
[1:02:32] in the word of God, it might produce A
[1:02:34] SUCH A FAITH IN YOU, YOU'LL JUST SPEAK A
[1:02:36] JOB RIGHT INTO EXISTENCE. WELL, LORD, I
[1:02:38] NEED A JOB THAT'LL LET ME GO TO TO
[1:02:39] church on Wednesday. I NEED A JOB
[1:02:41] THAT'LL LET ME GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY.
[1:02:43] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S THE CHILDREN'S
[1:02:45] BREAD. IT'S MY INHERITANCE. I AIN'T GOT
[1:02:47] TO WORK ON WEDNESDAY, AND I AIN'T GOT TO
[1:02:49] WORK ON SUNDAY. I AM OF THE FAITH SEED
[1:02:51] OF ABRAHAM. AND I CAN LOOK RIGHT IN MY
[1:02:53] BIBLE. OH MY MY GOODNESS. AND WE are
[1:02:55] living IN THE HOUR OF THE ADOPTION OF
[1:02:57] CHILDREN WHERE I CAN SPEAK TO THE
[1:02:59] MOUNTAIN. MOUNTAIN, GET OUT OF MY WAY. I
[1:03:02] MIGHT GOT BILLS AND I MIGHT HAVE THINGS
[1:03:03] TO PAY, BUT ONE THING I KNOW MY BIBLE
[1:03:05] SAID, HE WILL NEVER SEE THE RIGHTEOUS
[1:03:07] FORSAKEN AND BEGGING FOR BREAD. GO AHEAD
[1:03:09] AND TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD. YOU CAN SPEAK
[1:03:11] A JOB RIGHT INTO EXISTENCE. SAY, LORD
[1:03:13] GOD, I'M SPEAKING MY JOB INTO EXISTENCE.
[1:03:16] I AIN'T GOING TO WORK ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT
[1:03:18] AND I AIN'T GOING TO WORK ON SUNDAY.
[1:03:20] WHY? BECAUSE I AM THE FAITH SEED OF
[1:03:22] ABRAHAM. I HAVE AN INHERITANCE. I'VE
[1:03:24] HEARD THE READING OF MY WILL.
[1:03:30] I ABOVE all want you to prosper
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; and be in good health.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Well, WHEN THAT OLD GOLIATH STANDS IN
[1:03:37] YOUR WAY AND SAYS, "NOPE, YOU CAN'T
[1:03:39] PROSPER. YOU CAN'T BE IN GOOD HEALTH." I
[1:03:41] SAY, "OH, DEVIL, [screaming] I KNOW
[1:03:43] WHERE I AM STANDING. I HAVE HEARD THE
[1:03:46] READING OF MY WILL, AND IT IS HIS WILL
[1:03:50] THAT I SHALL PROSPER AND BE IN GOOD
[1:03:52] HEALTH."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:59] John 1:12 says, "But as many as received
[1:04:02] him,
[1:04:05] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:04:08] of God."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Even to them
[1:04:21] that believe on his name, power to
[1:04:24] become.
[1:04:26] How? How am I I can't be brother
[1:04:28] Brandon. WELL, PRAISE GOD. WE'RE NOT
[1:04:30] CALLED TO BE BROTHER BRANDHAM.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; But I tell you ONE THING YOU ARE CALLED
[1:04:34] to be is what the sheath wave was.
[1:04:38] [snorts]
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And that was A MANIFESTED SON OF God
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; with full power and dominion and full
[1:04:45] authority who could speak to a storm.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Think about what happened too when he
[1:04:51] went up. What was he obedient to? He was
[1:04:53] obedient to death.
[1:04:55] YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHEN BROTHER
[1:04:56] BRANDON WAS WALKING UP THAT MOUNTAIN, he
[1:04:58] was being obedient to die?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Just like you, WE KNOW THAT JESUS CHRIST
[1:05:04] WAS THE original for a sheath wave,
[1:05:07] right? And what was he obedient to? He
[1:05:09] was obedient to walk UP OR UP THAT HILL
[1:05:12] UP THAT MOUNTAIN CALLED GALATHA. WHAT?
[1:05:14] AND TO die for the sins our for our sins
[1:05:17] that that SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN Christ
[1:05:21] could be in us. And what was it? Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ, the sheath wave, was lifted up
[1:05:27] on Calvary. HE WAS WAVED BEFORE the
[1:05:29] people. If I be lifted up, I WILL DRAW
[1:05:31] ALL MEN UNTO THEE. AND THE ORIGINAL
[1:05:33] SHEATH WAVE, THE WORD that was made
[1:05:35] flesh, WAS WAVED BACK TO HIS BELIEVING
[1:05:38] CHILDREN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
[1:05:41] OH, we now I just want to preach the
[1:05:43] RISING OF THE SUN. WHAT a resurrection
[1:05:44] that was. And what a resurrection this
[1:05:47] is.
[1:05:48] What would the same life that WAS IN
[1:05:50] CHRIST JESUS NOW IN THE EVENING TIME
[1:05:53] ARISE AND SHINE GROSS DARKNESS UPON THE
[1:05:57] PEOPLE? BUT THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAS
[1:05:59] RISEN UPON YOU. NOT NOT JUST TO NOT JUST
[1:06:02] TO WARM YOUR SKIN AND TO SAY, "OH, THE
[1:06:04] SUN IS SHINING ON YOU." NO, BUT WHAT IS
[1:06:06] IT? IT'S THAT LIGHT NOW IN YOU. THE SAME
[1:06:09] RESURRECTION life in you. AND WE SAW ONE
[1:06:12] IN OUR DAY OBEDIENT unto death.
[1:06:15] And it was in that obedience
[1:06:19] THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN HE WALKED UP
[1:06:22] THERE IN OBEDIENCE,
[1:06:24] HE, you know, I, it's been a minute.
[1:06:27] I'll go revisit it. But he goes, "Would
[1:06:30] you walk with me?"
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, it would be the greatest privilege.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us to get a revelation of
[1:06:40] WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS. AMEN.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; It's an invitation.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; OH FOOLS AND SLOW OF heart
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; to know all that the prophets have
[1:06:52] spoken.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; They were walking with Jehovah AND
[1:06:56] DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS HIM.
[1:07:00] Oh my. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN WALKING WITH
[1:07:02] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR SO MANY YEARS.
[1:07:04] BUT I PRAY, OH GOD, GIVE US A REVELATION
[1:07:07] TO SEE THAT YOU ARE STANDING AMONGST US
[1:07:09] ONCE AGAIN. YOU ARE WALKING WITH US
[1:07:12] AGAIN.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And it's the greatest privilege
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; I have ever known is to have a
[1:07:19] revelation of Malachi 4:5 and Luke
[1:07:22] 17:30.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And it was in that moment of walking
[1:07:30] with him, [snorts]
[1:07:31] all of a sudden, what did he do? I don't
[1:07:34] know what step it was, but all of a
[1:07:36] sudden, he stepped right into an Eden
[1:07:38] condition.
[1:07:40] He was young again.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And even the deer started to come up.
[1:07:46] Adam, is that you?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because here
[1:07:52] WAS AN ADOPTED SON WITH THE SAME POWER
[1:07:55] AND AUTHORITY THAT ADAM HAD WHEN HE
[1:07:57] STOOD ON THE EARTH. HE COULD SPEAK TO
[1:07:59] THAT MOUNTAIN. He could speak to this
[1:08:01] cloud. HE COULD SPEAK TO THAT. AND THERE
[1:08:03] stood an adopted SON OF GOD STANDING
[1:08:05] THERE. AND HE SPOKE TO THE STORM AND
[1:08:07] SAID, "CLOUDS AND YOU YOU GO THIS WAY
[1:08:08] AND LET THE SUN SHINE FOR FOUR DAY." ALL
[1:08:11] OF NATURE HAD TO OBEY THAT VOICE. I
[1:08:13] WONDER IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF MOTHER
[1:08:15] NATURE WAS SAYING, "I'VE HEARD THAT
[1:08:17] BEFORE."
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT is all OF NATURE'S GROANING FOR THE
[1:08:22] MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[1:08:24] OF GOD? AND ACCORDING TO DIVINE PROMISE,
[1:08:27] HERE STOOD ONE ON THE EARTH AGAIN.
[1:08:33] AND when I SEE THAT, I KNOW THAT'S
[1:08:36] WHAT'S BEEN PROPHESIED for my life.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you that devil can
[1:08:41] try to SAY IT ANY KIND OF WAY HE WANT.
[1:08:43] BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. It's a
[1:08:44] promise.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I SHALL MANIFEST EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT
[1:08:49] WAS SPOKEN OVER THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:08:51] CHRIST. WHY? BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THE
[1:08:53] READING OF MY WILL. AND GOD DOESN'T give
[1:08:55] something to TAKE IT BACK. WHEN GOD
[1:08:57] GIVES YOU SOMETHING, HE MAKES A WAY FOR
[1:08:59] YOU TO RECEIVE IT. MAYBE YOU AIN'T GOT
[1:09:01] ARMS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT. MAYBE YOU
[1:09:03] FEEL LIKE, "HERE, I WANT TO GIVE YOU
[1:09:04] SOMETHING. I CAN'T HOLD IT. MY ARMS
[1:09:06] AREN'T BIG ENOUGH." WELL, HE'LL MAKE A
[1:09:08] WAY. HE'LL MAKE YOUR ARMS BIG ENOUGH.
[1:09:10] HE'LL MAKE YOUR HEART BIG ENOUGH. MATTER
[1:09:12] OF FACT, HE'LL PREDESTINATE A SEED OF
[1:09:14] GOD WITH ALL THE POWER to become.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS PLACED A SEED INSIDE
[1:09:22] YOU WITH THE POWER TO BECOME EVERYTHING
[1:09:24] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS SPOKEN OVER
[1:09:27] YOUR LIFE.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; All the potential
[1:09:34] is already there.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said God put the seed
[1:09:40] in there with the potentials that it
[1:09:43] would be what he said it would be.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I was just THINKING ABOUT THAT A
[1:09:50] LITTLE BIT AND I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT
[1:09:52] that eagle in the chicken yard.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; You know, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT
[1:09:56] EAGLE. JUST JUST THINK OF HOW WHAT AN
[1:09:58] ODD PECULIAR SIGHT THAT WOULD BE. Here's
[1:10:02] this eagle
[1:10:03] plucking around with chickens.
[1:10:06] You you would IMAGINE WALKING UP AND
[1:10:08] SEE, MAN, THAT'S THE ODDEST SIGHT THAT
[1:10:10] I'VE ever seen.
[1:10:12] Why is that eagle walking around AND
[1:10:16] SCRATCHING AT THE GROUND AND TRYING to
[1:10:19] eat the same thing that these chickens
[1:10:21] are eating?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; The bigger question would be why is that
[1:10:27] eagle tolerating that?
[1:10:30] Like, hey, [screaming]
[1:10:33] you're an eagle.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; But you know that eagle WASN'T TRAINED
[1:10:37] TO HEAR MY VOICE.
[1:10:40] And the problem WAS IS THAT EAGLE WAS
[1:10:42] FEEDING on
[1:10:44] chicken food and he was hearing chickens
[1:10:48] talk.
[1:10:50] [snorts]
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You know, and if you're listening to the
[1:10:52] things of the world, if you're listening
[1:10:54] to chickens,
[1:10:56] YOU MIGHT SOUND LIKE A CHICKEN. [snorts]
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; If you eat chicken food,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; you are what you eat.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; AND AS LONG AS THAT, but here's what I
[1:11:06] love to look at THIS STORY.
[1:11:10] IT WAS ALWAYS AN EAGLE.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; It just didn't know
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; it was an eagle.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; So here this chicken is I IT'S IT'S
[1:11:24] SCRATCHING AROUND IN THE BARNYARD. It's
[1:11:27] hearing chicken talk. It's eating
[1:11:29] chicken food.
[1:11:32] That's all it ever known.
[1:11:35] But what happened?
[1:11:40] All of a sudden, it started to hear
[1:11:41] something.
[1:11:43] And I got TO THINKING ABOUT THAT. WHAT
[1:11:45] ABOUT US? I wonder if maybe WE'VE GOT A
[1:11:47] LITTLE SPIRITUAL AMNESIA BECAUSE, YOU
[1:11:49] KNOW, THE REASON WE ACT LIKE the world
[1:11:51] and we sound LIKE THE WORLD AND IS IT IS
[1:11:53] IT BECAUSE of things that we're
[1:11:54] listening to? [snorts]
[1:11:57] You know, I wonder if we GOT A TASTE FOR
[1:11:59] THOSE THINGS. IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:12:01] WE JUST WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D stick
[1:12:03] around in the barnyard a little bit.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT WE WOULD SCRATCH AROUND THERE
[1:12:09] A LITTLE BIT LONGER. And you know
[1:12:10] what'll happen? The longer you stay, the
[1:12:12] more accustomed you'll get.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; But you see, if you're feeding on the
[1:12:17] things of the world, if you're eating
[1:12:19] the things of the world, then those are
[1:12:21] going to be the things you start to
[1:12:22] identify with and the start THINGS YOU
[1:12:24] START TO ENTERTAIN. BUT OH, THANK GOD.
[1:12:26] THE SCRIPTURE SAID, "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU
[1:12:28] ELIJAH." WHAT WAS IT? THAT eagle was
[1:12:31] always AN EAGLE. BUT WHAT WAS IT
[1:12:33] LACKING? IT WAS LACKING to hear from
[1:12:36] SOMETHING THAT WOULD IDENTIFY WHAT IT
[1:12:38] REALLY WAS.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And what was it? IT WAS THAT VOICE THAT
[1:12:42] WOULD CALL TO THAT eagle
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; and say, "LOOK, YOU DON'T BELONG down
[1:12:46] there.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't need to live like
[1:12:49] that. YOU DON'T NEED TO ACT LIKE THAT."
[1:12:51] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING IN THAT
[1:12:53] EAGLE, IT SAW SOMETHING THAT IT
[1:12:55] IDENTIFIED WITH.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE HEARING THIS
[1:12:58] MORNING. IT'S THE READING OF THE WHEEL.
[1:13:00] WE ACTUALLY SAW THE THE WORD TAKE ON
[1:13:02] FLESH in our day
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; in a vindicated word through a
[1:13:06] vindicated prophet.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And what was it? It was that eagle's
[1:13:10] life screaming out, testifying,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; calling your name. What What did you
[1:13:15] hear? WE HEAR BROTHER COSMAN SAYING,
[1:13:16] "WHAT WAS THE OPENING OF THE WORD?" IT
[1:13:18] WAS THE REVEALING and the calling OF
[1:13:20] YOUR NAMES. HEY, HEY, YOU DON'T BELONG
[1:13:22] down a lady. You You aren't a chicken.
[1:13:25] YOU DON'T BELONG IN DENOMINATIONS. YOU
[1:13:27] ARE AN EAGLE.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And what is it? IT'S THAT WORD THAT
[1:13:32] STARTS TO TURN THE HEART.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Back to the original faith.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; We'll try not to be much longer, but it
[1:13:41] would turn you back back to the original
[1:13:44] faith of the Pentecostal fathers. And
[1:13:47] then when we receive that original
[1:13:49] faith, then we can go all the way back.
[1:13:52] Now listen to this. THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:13:54] SAYS THIS. He says, "WHEN MEN SINNED, HE
[1:13:57] CROSSED a great chasm between he and God
[1:14:00] and and left. THERE'S NO WAY BACK. BUT
[1:14:03] GOD WAS FULL of mercy. He took a
[1:14:05] substitute and a lamb that was a
[1:14:07] substitute until the fullness of the
[1:14:09] time come when he God made flesh to take
[1:14:13] away sin. And now there's not even a
[1:14:15] chasm there.
[1:14:18] Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] That's how powerful the blood of Jesus
[1:14:23] Christ is.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; You realize that THERE WAS A GAP. THERE
[1:14:27] WAS A CHASM THAT YOU COULD NOT CROSS.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO WAY for you to get from
[1:14:34] here and get to God. AND YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:14:37] GOD DID? HE DIDN'T CREATE A BRIDGE.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He just eliminated THE GAP.
[1:14:45] YOU CAN'T EVEN FALL INTO THE CHASM. IT'S
[1:14:47] GONE. WHERE ARE YOUR SINS? YOU NEVER
[1:14:50] SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. HEY, THERE
[1:14:52] AIN'T NO GAP. YOU CAN'T EVEN FALL OFF
[1:14:54] THIS ROCK OF REVELATION.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW POWERFUL HE ELIMINATED THE
[1:15:02] GAP. [screaming]
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "And there's NOT EVEN A CHASM
[1:15:06] THERE.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; A MAN AND GOD BECOME FATHER AND SON.
[1:15:09] THERE'S NO SIN AT ALL."
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; WELL, go ahead and put your dancing
[1:15:13] shoes on.
[1:15:16] I'M SORRY. I'M OLDFASHIONED. I believe
[1:15:18] all the message.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I get excited about it. You
[1:15:24] I
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; You mean old devil, you've been lying?
[1:15:29] YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME I WASN'T
[1:15:30] FORGIVEN. WELL, YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU DID
[1:15:32] this and you did that. You know, you'll
[1:15:34] never be You'll never be the bride of
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ. The No, no, no, no. Yeah.
[1:15:38] You see, you see, you ain't no
[1:15:39] manifested son or daughter of God. You
[1:15:41] can never, you know, your foolish
[1:15:43] version.
[1:15:44] You know, you better start handing out
[1:15:46] bottles of water because that's the only
[1:15:47] way you're going to get in,
[1:15:52] right? OH, NO. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[1:15:55] BEING sure where we're standing.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; We got to know where we're standing. Oh,
[1:15:59] praise God. Listen to a vindicated pro.
[1:16:01] This is the reading of your will. THIS
[1:16:03] IS MALACHI 4:5. THIS IS YOUR
[1:16:05] IDENTIFICATION. THIS IS TELLING YOU WHO
[1:16:07] YOU ARE AND WHAT GOD'S DONE.
[1:16:11] He says, "A man and and and A MAN AND
[1:16:14] GOD BECOME FATHER AND SON. THERE'S no
[1:16:16] sin at all." He puts them in the sea of
[1:16:18] of the bleach of forgetfulness and can't
[1:16:20] even remember them no more. Hallelujah.
[1:16:24] Now, we can't do that. WE'RE HUMAN. WE
[1:16:26] COULD FORGIVE, but we cannot forget. But
[1:16:28] God is infinite and he's so great that
[1:16:31] he can absolutely forget you. Even did
[1:16:35] it. Well, take that to the devil AND
[1:16:37] GIVE HIM A BLACK EYE. HE'D BEEN TRYING
[1:16:39] TO BRING UP YOUR PAST AND TRYING TO
[1:16:41] REMIND YOU OF YOUR PAST AND TELL YOU
[1:16:43] THIS AND THAT, BUT OH, YOU CAN TELL THAT
[1:16:44] OLD DEVIL NAUGHTY. CAN YOU IMAG?
[1:16:49] CAN YOU IMAGINE OUR ACCUSER OF THE
[1:16:51] BRETHREN COMING TO GOD AND TRYING TO
[1:16:53] TELL GOD AND SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:16:55] YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM UH YOU WANT TO YOU
[1:16:57] KNOW, YOU YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM THE
[1:16:59] KINGDOM AND AND YOU KNOW, BUT YOU'RE A
[1:17:01] RIGHTEOUS GOD. YOU'RE A GOD OF LAW. AND
[1:17:03] YOU KNOW WHAT? ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN
[1:17:04] LAW, THEY'RE NOT EVEN RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:17:07] ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE WORD THAT YOU'VE
[1:17:09] GIVEN TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DID THIS AND
[1:17:11] THIS AND THIS AND THIS. YOU REMEMBER?
[1:17:15] NO.
[1:17:17] WHAT? Could you imagine HOW MAD THE
[1:17:19] DEVIL WOULD GET? WELL, WAIT A SECOND.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; WAIT, you're God.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; I know WHAT THEY DID. THEY KNOW WHAT
[1:17:28] THEY DID. And you know what they did.
[1:17:33] Nope.
[1:17:35] Could you I I COULD YOU SEE THAT DEVIL
[1:17:37] STARTING TO GET STEAM and get mad? Well,
[1:17:39] you mean you YOU'RE GOD. YOU KNOW ALL
[1:17:42] THINGS. You know everything. YEAH. AND I
[1:17:45] KNOW THAT WHEN I PAID THE PRICE ON
[1:17:47] CALVARY, I SAID, "IT IS FINISHED." AND
[1:17:49] THEY WERE THE VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF
[1:17:52] JESUS CHRIST. THEY NEVER DID IT IN THE
[1:17:54] FIRST PLACE. I HAVE removed the chasm.
[1:17:57] There is no gap.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming]
[1:18:01] HALLELUJAH. I TELL YOU, WE MIGHT MIGHT
[1:18:03] NOT BE ABLE TO FORGET WHAT, BUT WHEN THE
[1:18:05] DEVIL starts to bring IT TO OUR
[1:18:07] REMEMBRANCE, I TELL YOU, WE JUST NEED TO
[1:18:09] REMIND THAT OLD DEVIL, HEY, I have been
[1:18:11] forgiven, and God doesn't even know what
[1:18:13] you're talking about.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Now, we can't do that. WE'RE HUMAN. WE
[1:18:20] CAN FORGIVE, BUT CANNOT FORGIVE. BUT GOD
[1:18:22] IS INFINITE, and he's so great that he
[1:18:24] can absolutely forget you even did it.
[1:18:26] Think of it.
[1:18:29] Hey, you might not be able to amen me,
[1:18:30] but you can amen a prophet.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You never did even sin. And there puts a
[1:18:36] man again IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, HIS
[1:18:38] FATHER. And you're his child. WE ARE
[1:18:41] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD NOW. NOT WILL
[1:18:43] BE. NOW WE ARE THE SONS and daughters OF
[1:18:45] GOD. OH MY. THAT MAKES A METHODIST FEEL
[1:18:48] LIKE SHOUTING, DOESN'T IT?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. If a Methodist is
[1:18:52] going to sound like shouting, then I, AS
[1:18:54] A MESSAGE BELIEVER, I KIND OF FEEL LIKE
[1:18:56] SHOUTING, TOO. to think that I never did
[1:18:59] it in THE FIRST PLACE. I KNOW IT'S A
[1:19:01] TALL ORDER TO BE THE MANIFESTED BRIDE OF
[1:19:03] JESUS CHRIST. I KNOW IT'S A TALL ORDER
[1:19:05] TO GO IN A RAPTURE. I KNOW IT'S A TALL
[1:19:07] ORDER TO GO INTO A BODY CHANGE. BUT I
[1:19:09] WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE AIN'T NO BAGGAGE
[1:19:11] HOLDING ME DOWN. THERE AIN'T NO SIN.
[1:19:13] THERE AIN'T NOTHING THAT I EVER DID.
[1:19:15] THERE AIN'T NO HABITS. THERE'S NOTHING
[1:19:16] THAT'S HANGING ON ME THAT'S GOING TO
[1:19:18] KEEP ME FROM WALKING INTO THE
[1:19:19] INHERITANCE THAT I'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED
[1:19:22] BY ALMIGHTY GOD. SO WHEN THAT DEVIL
[1:19:24] TRIES TO BRING IT UP AND TRIES TO TELL
[1:19:25] ME, "WELL, NOT YOU. YEAH, ME. WHY?
[1:19:28] BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM MY THEOPHONY.
[1:19:30] I have heard THE READING OF MY WILL. I
[1:19:32] AM PREDESTINATED UNTO ADOPTION. MY NAME
[1:19:36] HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF
[1:19:38] LIFE. HEY, THAT MAKES ME SOUND LIKE
[1:19:40] SHOUTING. I THINK I'LL SHOUT ABOUT IT.
[1:19:42] WHY? I AM THE SINLESS, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF
[1:19:44] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Not I am going to be a son of God.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I am. Not that I am a redeemed son of
[1:19:58] God. I AM NOT THAT I WILL BE FORGIVEN. I
[1:20:03] AM NOT THAT I WILL BE JUSTIFIED. I AM
[1:20:06] NOT THAT my name will be written in THE
[1:20:08] BOOK OF LIFE. MY NAME'S ALREADY WRITTEN
[1:20:10] ON THE man's book of life.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:20:16] Now, just moving quickly to a close.
[1:20:20] Brother Brandham says this, AND I I JUST
[1:20:22] THOUGHT I would would would I I put this
[1:20:24] quote in there because I want to read a
[1:20:25] very familiar quote, but brother uh
[1:20:27] Cosman this morning was talking about
[1:20:29] the reading of our will. And this is a
[1:20:31] real familiar quote. So just act like
[1:20:33] you never heard it before.
[1:20:36] Just act like this is new. And and maybe
[1:20:38] somebody here you might just say amen.
[1:20:42] Then we stand Christ the mystery of God
[1:20:44] real. Then we stand justified in the
[1:20:46] presence of God as a drop OF INK
[1:20:49] DROPPING INTO A TUB full of bleach.
[1:20:52] You'll never find the stain of ink no
[1:20:55] more.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; It went somewhere.
[1:20:58] It'll never come back again.
[1:21:01] And when a man
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; is truly redeemed,
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; that predestinated seed that sees it and
[1:21:10] accepts it,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; his sins are [screaming]
[1:21:14] deolished.
[1:21:17] It's gone. It's separated. It's dropped
[1:21:21] into the ink of the blood of Jesus
[1:21:25] Christ. And it's never to be remembered.
[1:21:28] God forgets it. and he stands as a son
[1:21:33] and daughter of God in the presence of
[1:21:36] God.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; You might not feel his presence.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; HEY, YOU MIGHT FEEL EMPTY. YOU MIGHT NOT
[1:21:43] FEEL LIKE HIS PRESENCE IS AROUND YOU.
[1:21:45] BUT OH, PRAISE GOD. I AIN'T GOT TO FEEL
[1:21:47] IT TO KNOW THAT I'M STANDING IN HIS
[1:21:50] PRESENCE BECAUSE A PREDESTINATED SEED ON
[1:21:53] THE INSIDE OF ME HAS HEARD THE MESSAGE
[1:21:55] OF THE HOUR AND IT HAS TOLD ME I NEVER
[1:21:58] SINNED in the first place. AND RIGHT NOW
[1:22:02] I'M STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:22:05] [screaming] MY FATHER. HALLELUJAH. I
[1:22:07] KNOW THAT HIS ANGELS ARE ENCAMPED around
[1:22:10] them THAT FEAR HIM. AND I KNOW THE ANGEL
[1:22:12] OF THE LORD. I KNOW CHRIST IS PRESENT
[1:22:15] RIGHT [screaming] HERE, RIGHT NOW. THE
[1:22:18] PRESENT TENSE OF GOD IS RIGHT HERE. OH,
[1:22:20] I AIN'T GOT TO FEEL IT. BUT YOU KNOW
[1:22:22] WHAT? BECAUSE I GOT THE REVELATION OF
[1:22:24] IT, IT GOES BEYOND MY FEELINGS. IT GOES
[1:22:27] BEYOND MY SENSATIONS. IT GOES DOWN INTO
[1:22:30] THE SOUL REALM. AND IT'S SO REAL THAT
[1:22:32] THAT SOUL REALM TAKES OVER THIS VESSEL.
[1:22:35] AND I JUST CAN'T HELP TO SING. I CAN'T
[1:22:38] HELP TO SHOUT. I CAN'T HELP TO SAY,
[1:22:40] "THERE IS NO MORE CHASM. THERE IS NO
[1:22:43] MORE SIN. I'M RIGHT NOW IN THE PRESENCE
[1:22:46] OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I could tone it down, BUT YOU
[1:22:51] KNOW WHAT? GOD, GIVE ME A STYLE.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; God anoints the man of the hour to catch
[1:22:57] the people of the hour. Well, you know
[1:22:58] what? MAYBE THIS AIN'T YOUR HOUR, BUT
[1:23:00] IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUR. SO, LET'S
[1:23:02] JUST ALL get together AND BELIEVE FOR
[1:23:03] ONE ANOTHER AND ACCEPT THE MESSAGE OF
[1:23:05] THE HOUR.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I got a quote for that if you didn't
[1:23:09] like it.
[1:23:11] RIGHT? WE'RE ALL FLOWERS. WE EXPRESS
[1:23:14] OURSELVES ANY KIND OF WAY WE WANT. I
[1:23:16] COULD READ A, YOU KNOW, PROBLEM IS THE
[1:23:18] PROPHET OF GOD SAID WE GET SPIRITUAL
[1:23:20] AMNESIA WHEN WE GET CAUGHT between two
[1:23:21] opinions.
[1:23:23] Well, IS IT THE WORD OF GOD OR ISN'T IT?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; SO, IF IT'S SOFT SPOKEN OR IF IT'S
[1:23:27] YELLED, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God or isn't it?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS IS WE'VE GOTTEN TO A
[1:23:35] PLACE WHERE WE'RE BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS.
[1:23:36] WELL, it's a little too excitable. So,
[1:23:39] you know, I I don't want to I don't want
[1:23:42] to say amen because then I'm amening
[1:23:44] emotion.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. I I I'LL HIT IT RIGHT
[1:23:51] WHERE that's where we're at. Well, you
[1:23:54] know what? IF THE PREACHER'S RUNNING ALL
[1:23:55] over the place, IF IF I START TO SAY
[1:23:57] AMEN AND IF I GET EMOTIONAL, that means,
[1:24:00] you know, I'm I'm kind of I'm kind of uh
[1:24:02] leaning towards an emotion and and I'm
[1:24:04] just amen and emotion and not the word.
[1:24:07] Well, yeah. Now, if I'm running around
[1:24:08] and SCREAMING AND I AIN'T SAYING WHAT A
[1:24:09] PROPHET SAID, DON'T SAY AMEN.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But whether I whisper it OR WHETHER I
[1:24:14] SHOUT IT, ONE THING WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE
[1:24:16] TO DO IS AMEN IT. BUT SOME OF US HAVE
[1:24:18] GOTTEN STUCK BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS, WE
[1:24:20] DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO AMEN it or to SO
[1:24:22] WE DON'T DO NOTHING.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH. But when somebody ELSE FITS YOUR
[1:24:27] STYLE AND TASTE, WE CAN HEAR YOU LOUD
[1:24:28] AND CLEAR.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE LOUDEST ONE IN THE BUILDING.
[1:24:32] AMEN. [screaming]
[1:24:33] THAT'S RIGHT. I LIKE HIS STYLE.
[1:24:37] BUT THEN AN EVANGELIST come and SAY THE
[1:24:39] SAME EXACT THING. NOTHING.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN EVANGELISTS COME AND SAY THE
[1:24:45] SAME THING. [screaming] AMEN. AND THEN
[1:24:48] AND THEN SOMEBODY COME AND they teach
[1:24:49] and lay out the word. Nothing.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Look friends, I I AM TIRED OF BEING
[1:24:54] CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS. I JUST WANT
[1:24:57] SOMEBODY TO TELL ME THE TRUTH. WHETHER
[1:24:59] YOU WHISPER IT, WHETHER YOU SHOUT IT,
[1:25:01] THERE'S A SEED INSIDE OF ME THAT'S
[1:25:03] PREDESTINATED TO RECEIVE IT. AND I WILL
[1:25:06] SAY AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD TOLD US
[1:25:09] AMEN.
[1:25:10] WELL, IF YOU CAN AT LEAST JUST DO
[1:25:12] SOMETHING SAY GET THEM. GET THEM,
[1:25:14] PREACHER. GET HIM.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I know some of us got it all figured
[1:25:19] out. And and they know and and I look
[1:25:22] look I've heard it. I you know I don't
[1:25:24] get nothing when he preaches.
[1:25:27] Well, that's all right. Some people do.
[1:25:31] But don't rob them of their blessing
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; because your attitude is what's
[1:25:36] hindering the moving of the spirit.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm sorry. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE UP
[1:25:42] HERE ANYWAYS, BUT WHAT WE GOT IS A BAD
[1:25:44] CASE OF SPIRITUAL AMNESIA.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; WELL, we're afraid TO BE WHAT GOD'S
[1:25:50] CALLED US to be.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; But I tell you WHAT, IF WE TAKE THE
[1:25:53] VEILS OUT OF THE WAY,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; SEE, that's our problem.
[1:25:57] We look at it too much of the flesh.
[1:25:59] WHETHER IT'S BROTHER BILLY, WHETHER IT'S
[1:26:00] BROTHER DAVID, WHETHER IT'S BROTHER
[1:26:01] ANDREW, WHETHER IT'S OUR PASTOR, I want
[1:26:03] to say if THEY'RE SAYING WHAT A
[1:26:05] VINDICATED PROPHET SAID, "AMEN.
[1:26:07] [screaming]
[1:26:08] AMEN."
[1:26:09] SICK AND BOY, GET THEM.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; But you know what THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:26:17] SAID? WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT BETWEEN two
[1:26:18] opinions, you lose your reasoning.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Matthew's preaching tonight. I
[1:26:25] don't even know why I'm here.
[1:26:29] You mean I got to listen to Junior
[1:26:31] again?
[1:26:38] You mean Brother Ben, he ain't been
[1:26:41] serving the Lord a tenth of the time
[1:26:42] that I've been preaching. I can't get
[1:26:44] nothing from him.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; He's just a baby. What can he tell me?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Billy. We all love Brother
[1:26:54] Billy.
[1:26:56] Give me brother Billy.
[1:27:02] He didn't like that. Brother Billy, you
[1:27:05] know, I'll have to throw him under the
[1:27:06] bus with all the rest of us. WHY DOES
[1:27:08] BILLY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING? HE'S
[1:27:10] [snorts] ALWAYS PREACHING, ALWAYS
[1:27:12] LEADING SONGS, ALWAYS STANDING BEHIND
[1:27:13] HERE. You know, there's spirits like
[1:27:16] that.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about spiritual amnesia.
[1:27:22] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOVE. LOOK THAT LOOK
[1:27:24] I I'VE I'VE HEARD IT. I I've heard it
[1:27:26] and and and I marvel at and I I think
[1:27:28] it's wonderful and it's THE WAY THAT GOD
[1:27:29] THAT GOD DOES IT IS AND SOMETIMES ONE
[1:27:31] PREACHER CAN SAY SOMETHING AND A AND
[1:27:33] then another one COME ALONG AND LIKE MAN
[1:27:35] I've never heard that in all my life.
[1:27:38] YOU KNOW PASTORS will be like I've been
[1:27:39] preaching on that for four weeks.
[1:27:43] Some like one planth one waterth but God
[1:27:45] gives the increase. ALL I WANT IS THE
[1:27:47] INCREASE. And I'm sick AND TIRED OF
[1:27:49] DEVILS TRYING TO ROB THIS CHURCH OF THE
[1:27:52] INCREASE. GOD GIVE US A MESSAGE. HE give
[1:27:55] us the Holy Spirit. I said WE OUGHT TO
[1:27:56] WELCOME IT. WE OUGHT TO AMEN IT. WE
[1:27:59] OUGHT TO SHOUT. WE OUGHT TO DANCE. WE
[1:28:00] OUGHT TO RUN. WE IF IT'S SLAIN, I DON'T
[1:28:02] CARE WHAT IT IS. BUT WHATEVER IT IS, I
[1:28:04] WANT TO SAY IT'S for you.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody didn't like that, but I
[1:28:11] said it anyways.
[1:28:16] May May I just say this that for the
[1:28:18] critic who's getting critical right now,
[1:28:19] go listen to getting in the spirit
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; and I'll leave it right there. But I
[1:28:25] when did we ever get to the place where
[1:28:27] we can't have joy
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; and and you know what WE COULD TAKE TIME
[1:28:31] AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M OUT HERE BUT
[1:28:32] YOU I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYWAY so
[1:28:34] here I am. The prophet OF GOD ACTUALLY
[1:28:37] SAT IN THE SEAT OF PLAYING THE CRITIC
[1:28:39] AND HE SAID, "OH MY GOODNESS, HERE COMES
[1:28:41] THAT DANCING in the church." and he got
[1:28:43] to thinking, "NOT IN MY CHURCH." And you
[1:28:45] know what? THANK GOD HE GAVE US A
[1:28:47] PROPHET. HE THOUGHT, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:28:49] MAYBE I'LL JUST RUN IT THROUGH THE
[1:28:50] SCRIPTURE."
[1:28:53] And he got to running IT THROUGH THE
[1:28:55] SCRIPTURE, WHAT A VINDICATED PROPHET
[1:28:56] DOES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? AND I
[1:28:58] FOUND OUT THAT DANCING means victory.
[1:29:02] And you know what he said? Before I
[1:29:04] REALIZED WHAT I WAS DOING, I WAS OUT
[1:29:06] THERE in the middle dancing with her.
[1:29:09] Not like that. BUT HE WAS DANCING ALL
[1:29:11] AROUND. WHY? BECAUSE HE GOT TO LOOKING
[1:29:13] IN THE WORD AND he said, "MY GOODNESS,
[1:29:15] IF DANCING MEANS VICTORY, WHAT KIND OF
[1:29:18] VICTORY DO I GOT?" YOU RUN IT THROUGH
[1:29:20] THE OLD TESTAMENT. YOU RUN IT THROUGH
[1:29:22] CALVARY. YOU RUN IT THROUGH THE CHURCH
[1:29:24] AGES AND THEN A VINDICATOR PROPHESY, YOU
[1:29:27] ARE HIS VICTORY. HALLELUJAH. I GOT
[1:29:31] VICTORY TONIGHT. I GOT THE VICTORY OF
[1:29:34] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. I GOT THE
[1:29:36] VICTORY OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:29:38] SOMEBODY WANTS THE JOY OF THEIR
[1:29:40] SALVATION RESTORED. I WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:29:42] WHAT ABOUT THE VICTORY THAT THE GREAT
[1:29:45] MIGHTY CONQUEROR HAS CONQUERED. AND WHAT
[1:29:47] A RESURRECTION THAT WAS. AND WHAT A
[1:29:49] RESURRECTION THIS IS. ARISE AND SHINE.
[1:29:53] THY LIGHT HAS COME.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; We're standing right now in the presence
[1:30:02] of God. Amen. Now we are the sons OF
[1:30:06] GOD. NOT WILL BE. We are.
[1:30:10] Now we are redeemed. Brothers, if you
[1:30:14] can cue that up, I'm going to play that
[1:30:16] uh last six minutes of spiritual
[1:30:18] amnesia. Whatever the paragraph, uh,
[1:30:20] Brother Gary, was it 215?
[1:30:24] We have Satan's answer. God has
[1:30:27] vindicated himself. God has proved
[1:30:29] himself to his promise in this day.
[1:30:32] Hallelujah. The headship is here.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ the risen Lord is here in
[1:30:40] THE SAME POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION THAT
[1:30:42] HE EVER WAS MANIFESTING HIMSELF. THERE
[1:30:45] IS THE DEVIL'S ANSWER. WHERE IS THE
[1:30:48] DEVIL'S ANSWER?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; It ain't in a tomb in Jerusalem.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, BUT IT WAS RESURRECTED ON THE THIRD
[1:30:57] DAY.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And we're living in THE HOUR OF
[1:31:00] RESURRECTION. WHERE IS his victory?
[1:31:05] Is it in a tomb in Jeffersonville?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. HIS RESURRECTION IS in you. AND
[1:31:13] IN YOU, WE ARE [screaming] HIS VICTORY.
[1:31:17] AND RIGHT NOW, HE IS HERE IN THE SAME
[1:31:19] POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION THAT HE EVER
[1:31:22] WAS MANIFESTING HIMSELF. THERE'S THE
[1:31:25] DEVIL'S ANSWER. I WANT TO TELL THAT OLD
[1:31:27] DEVIL, HE IS RIGHT HERE THIS NIGHT IN
[1:31:30] THE SAME POWER AND SAME MANIFESTATION
[1:31:33] THAT HE EVER WAS. AND I KNOW WHERE
[1:31:36] [screaming] I AM STANDING. I'LL PRAY FOR
[1:31:38] 1,000 PEOPLE. AND IF NOT ONE OF THEM
[1:31:40] GETS HEALED, MY GOD IS A HEALER. AND
[1:31:43] I'VE BEEN GIVEN A DIVINE COMMISSION TO
[1:31:45] CAST OUT EVIL SPIRITS, TO LAY HANDS ON
[1:31:48] THE SICK, AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. I HAVE
[1:31:50] BEEN COMMISSIONED TO DO THE GREATER
[1:31:52] WORKS. I CAN SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN.
[1:31:55] MOUNTAIN, [screaming] YOU GOT TO GO.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; We are
[1:32:07] the devil's answer.
[1:32:09] Hallelujah. I'm feeling pretty good. I
[1:32:12] feel like I can finally start preaching.
[1:32:14] The Bible says, "Let this mind be in
[1:32:16] you."
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:32:26] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:32:28] not robbery to be equal with God.
[1:32:32] Listen to what he says. rising of the
[1:32:34] sun and he being the groom, the bride
[1:32:38] has to come forth
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; because it's part of him
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and it can only be the manifestation
[1:32:48] of fulfilling of all the revelations any
[1:32:52] others has spoke of the bride.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; It can only manifest it DOES THIS IF IT
[1:32:59] DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM the groom,
[1:33:01] it isn't the bride.
[1:33:06] Now, we can look at the age, we can look
[1:33:08] at the church, and we look at we can
[1:33:10] look at the individual. So, if there's
[1:33:12] something in my life that's manifesting
[1:33:14] the groom, THAT'S NOT TELLING ME I'M NOT
[1:33:16] PART OF HIM. WHAT IT'S TELLING ME
[1:33:18] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S HANGING ON ME
[1:33:19] THAT'S NOT part of him.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And I need deliverance. I need to bring
[1:33:24] it under subjection.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; He says it isn't. He says it it does
[1:33:30] something different from the groom. It
[1:33:31] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[1:33:33] his flesh and bone of his bone AND LIFE
[1:33:35] OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS POWER. She is
[1:33:38] him.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and call me a fanatic. Call me
[1:33:43] a Pentecostal. Call me a holy roller.
[1:33:46] Call me whatever you want to call me.
[1:33:48] BUT ONE THING, YOU BETTER CALL ME. CALL
[1:33:49] ME REDEEMED.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Call me the bride of Christ. Tell me she
[1:33:54] is him. And it ain't about what I can
[1:33:57] do. It's about what HE'S ALREADY DONE.
[1:33:59] HE'S ALREADY removed the doubt. He's
[1:34:01] already written my name on the lamb's
[1:34:03] book of life. HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:34:05] BUT I WANT TO bring it a little further.
[1:34:07] Let us go on under perfection.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Right? We're we're settling that. I
[1:34:12] think we've taken some time TO SETTLE
[1:34:13] THAT. AND OUR PROPHETS HAVE BEEN
[1:34:15] PREACHING on character.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Now that we know where we're standing, I
[1:34:19] TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING
[1:34:21] ABOUT IT,
[1:34:23] [snorts]
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; It's time to start taking that word AND
[1:34:27] PUT IT INTO ACTION.
[1:34:29] What did we hear in that opening quote?
[1:34:31] No matter what anybody does or what
[1:34:32] anybody says, let them say what they
[1:34:35] want to
[1:34:38] know where I am standing. Hallelujah.
[1:34:41] Now I just leave off here. We getting a
[1:34:43] little long and that tends to happen.
[1:34:46] [snorts]
[1:34:48] Prophet of God says, "As long as you
[1:34:50] still love the world, no matter how much
[1:34:52] you confess to be up here, you're not up
[1:34:55] here, you're down there.
[1:34:57] He that loves the world and the things
[1:34:59] of the world, the love of God hasn't
[1:35:01] entered into him yet. Now, now don't let
[1:35:04] the devil condemn you of that. You're
[1:35:06] just still scratching around in the
[1:35:07] barnyard. But what when brother Brandon
[1:35:10] was preaching that message about uh
[1:35:13] spiritual amnesia, he says the church
[1:35:15] has forgotten what she is. We act like
[1:35:18] the world. And he SAID IT SHOWS THAT WE
[1:35:20] GOT spiritual amnesia. But he goes on
[1:35:22] and says, "But when you raise above that
[1:35:24] to the heavenly things, then set your
[1:35:26] affections on things above because you
[1:35:28] are risen with Christ and now seated
[1:35:30] together in heavenly places." Look,
[1:35:32] that's where we belong. We But we belong
[1:35:35] flying high above the cares of this
[1:35:37] world. I'm going to have to stop, but I
[1:35:39] I just want to preface this with saying
[1:35:41] this
[1:35:43] and every may everything maybe we were
[1:35:44] leading up to. I think sometimes if
[1:35:47] we're not careful, we get spiritual
[1:35:49] amnesia
[1:35:50] and we forget who we are. We forget our
[1:35:54] character of what the message is wanting
[1:35:56] to produce in us.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And brother Ben would take time and show
[1:35:59] how Nebuchadnezzar, he told he didn't
[1:36:01] even know he was a human anymore. And
[1:36:03] I'm wondering if we're starting to lose
[1:36:05] our identification of of believers.
[1:36:09] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:36:11] didn't even know he was a man anymore.
[1:36:13] Are we forgetting we're the bride of
[1:36:15] Christ? There's a certain way that we
[1:36:18] dress. And I'm not talking about uh you
[1:36:21] know uh uh uh uh uh being conformed.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about conforming.
[1:36:27] But I see I I I see you know there's a
[1:36:30] drift in our dress and and the way we
[1:36:33] conduct ourselves and the music that we
[1:36:34] listen to. And I wonder if if we're not
[1:36:37] careful, we're getting a bad case of
[1:36:38] spiritual amnesia.
[1:36:40] [snorts]
[1:36:42] You know, the music we listen to is
[1:36:43] sounding more and more like the world.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we got spiritual amnesia.
[1:36:56] I I wouldn't doubt there's some
[1:36:57] oldfashioned Pentecostals with some of
[1:36:59] the stuff we listen to, they like,
[1:37:00] uh-uh.
[1:37:03] And I and I tell you, I it reminds me
[1:37:05] that Jesus said, "I sanctify myself for
[1:37:07] their sake."
[1:37:10] What did he have to sanctify himself
[1:37:12] for?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; The sinless
[1:37:16] lamb of God.
[1:37:18] What What was he doing? He was being an
[1:37:20] example.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And And I think we've forgotten what
[1:37:24] we're supposed to be.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; We We're getting so close to the edge
[1:37:29] now.
[1:37:31] Just Just as close, but as long as we
[1:37:33] can say we're believers, I say, "Let's
[1:37:35] get closer to the wall. Let's get as
[1:37:37] close to this message. Let's get as
[1:37:38] close. LOOK, I MEAN I MEAN DON'T DON'T
[1:37:41] WEAR YOUR SKIRTS JUST as short to get
[1:37:42] away with it or your your clothes all
[1:37:45] these things and brothers and how you
[1:37:47] conduct yourself. I didn't mean to get
[1:37:48] on all that. I want to I want to let you
[1:37:50] go. BUT BUT BUT I SAY OH HAVE WE GOTTEN
[1:37:53] a little spiritual amnesia
[1:37:55] that we we forgot the reading of the
[1:37:57] will that we heard this morning of what
[1:37:59] we are really supposed to be and what
[1:38:01] the character of God is really supposed
[1:38:02] to produce in our life.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world.
[1:38:08] Just cue that up for me so I can stop.
[1:38:18] Now let me instruct these people here
[1:38:20] first. My friends, whatever you're here
[1:38:22] for, he know I can prove it to you to
[1:38:25] take one by one bring you up here on
[1:38:27] this platform and there won't be one
[1:38:29] thing that he won't make known. Now
[1:38:31] that's been since I was a little boy.
[1:38:33] That gift's not in question. But the
[1:38:35] question is, can you receive it? Do you
[1:38:38] believe it? Now you share. What if you
[1:38:40] HEAR THAT? THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING.
[1:38:41] HE keeps his word. Then just believe
[1:38:43] that you receive it and accept it. Raise
[1:38:46] up and say, "Lord God, I'm here to
[1:38:47] accept it." AND JUST STAY THERE till it
[1:38:49] happens.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Like Buddy Robinson said one time in a
[1:38:52] corn field. He said, "Lord, if you don't
[1:38:54] give me the Holy Ghost when you come
[1:38:55] back, you'll find a pile of bones laying
[1:38:56] right here."
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; He was dead earnest. And you're not
[1:39:00] going to get anything from God that you
[1:39:01] get desperate about. Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Now, have you noticed today prop? Have
[1:39:05] you noticed today what we do? We
[1:39:07] actually we got enough God about us and
[1:39:09] we come up to the platform. We say yes,
[1:39:12] maybe I better come up. Now, this is
[1:39:14] experience of worldwide.
[1:39:16] Yes, I better go up and stand say well
[1:39:20] well I don't know here I am. See
[1:39:24] what a place to be in. THERE'S NO FIRE
[1:39:26] BURNING. There's no enthusiasm. THERE'S
[1:39:29] NOT A GO INTO IT. And as an evangelist,
[1:39:32] that just kills me to see God's people
[1:39:35] in that shape.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be on fire.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, WHAT is it? It's exactly
[1:39:42] what I told you. Revelation 3, you're
[1:39:43] lukewarm. And he said, because you're
[1:39:46] lukewarm, I'm going to spew you out of
[1:39:47] my mouth.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And if he said
[1:39:51] that, that's what he's going to do.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; So, let's not be that crowd. You're
[1:39:56] you're needy. LET'S GET IT OR DIE.
[1:39:59] THAT'S RIGHT. Let's get it or die.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Now, my dear brother, sister, if I could
[1:40:04] come down and help you do something, I'd
[1:40:06] sure do it.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Now, by gift, I can tell you what you're
[1:40:10] here for. I can tell you what by the
[1:40:13] Holy Ghost, by God's spirit, tell you
[1:40:15] what you've come for, what you've done,
[1:40:17] what will be the future or something
[1:40:19] like that. But that don't take care of
[1:40:21] it.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You've got to accept this yourself.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; It's got to be you. Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Now, are you ready? Raise up your hand.
[1:40:30] Say, "I'm ready. I'm ready to die right
[1:40:32] here." Uh, don't do it unless you mean
[1:40:34] it. I'm ready to die right here. Or get
[1:40:37] what I want from God. Amen. Are you
[1:40:40] really ready? Then let the audience
[1:40:42] stand everywhere.
[1:40:43] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Now, together,
[1:40:47] together, let's unite ourselves
[1:40:49] together.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Let's pray and let's just you ministers
[1:40:54] now walk up to these people here,
[1:40:55] everyone. And you're representing the
[1:40:59] hands of Christ. Now you that wants the
[1:41:01] Holy Spirit. You that wants that
[1:41:03] experience, not a emotional excitement.
[1:41:06] You want THE HOLY GHOST, THE LIFE, the
[1:41:09] germ of life inside you. And you want to
[1:41:12] get rid of that amnesia that's making
[1:41:15] you can't identify yourself. You don't
[1:41:17] know where YOU STAND. YOU DON'T KNOW
[1:41:19] WHAT YOU ARE. Let's get rid of it right
[1:41:21] now. There's a new birth here for you. A
[1:41:23] real genuine new birth. Now, let's lay
[1:41:26] our hands over on these people. Let's
[1:41:28] everyone raise up our hands and pray
[1:41:30] with one accord.
[1:41:32] Heavenly Father,
[1:41:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:41:38] grant all that in Jesus Christ's name
[1:41:42] that the Holy Ghost will come tonight,
[1:41:45] this Saturday night, where the Holy
[1:41:47] Ghost like a rushing mighty wind. MAY
[1:41:50] THESE PEOPLE BE BAPTIZED INTO THE HOLY
[1:41:52] GHOST. MAY THE FIRE AND POWER OF GOD NOT
[1:41:56] LEAVE THEM. If you're here in the
[1:41:57] morning, MAY THEY STAY stay until the
[1:42:00] Holy Ghost come. That's the idea. That's
[1:42:03] it. There it is. That's the Holy Ghost
[1:42:05] coming.
[1:42:07] That's the Leave it now. Accept it. Be
[1:42:11] filled with his
[1:42:19] Amen. May we all just stand. I was just
[1:42:22] pricricked in my heart just just as the
[1:42:24] prophet of God was closing that out. I
[1:42:26] say, "Oh, I I don't want any spiritual
[1:42:29] amnesia.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I don't want to forget who I
[1:42:33] am." I say, "Oh, may I cry out to God?
[1:42:35] Let the baptism of the Holy Ghost come.
[1:42:38] Lord, take away any spiritual amnesia
[1:42:41] that's made me forget who I am and and
[1:42:43] maybe forget what the message of the
[1:42:45] hour is. If I've made it some type of
[1:42:47] religion, if I've made it some type of
[1:42:49] explanation, as long as I say, "Amen. I
[1:42:51] got it. Oh no, but it's the person of
[1:42:53] Jesus Christ. And I say, "Oh, oh, just
[1:42:56] as he said right here, heavenly father,
[1:42:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus, grant it,
[1:43:00] Lord, that in the Jesus Christ name that
[1:43:02] the Holy Ghost will come tonight, this
[1:43:04] Saturday night where the Holy Ghost fell
[1:43:06] like a rushing mighty wind. May these
[1:43:08] people be baptized into the Holy Ghost."
[1:43:10] I say, "My, if it worked for the prophet
[1:43:12] right there in 1964, I say if it was
[1:43:15] good enough for him, it's good enough
[1:43:16] for me. I want more of the Holy Ghost."
[1:43:19] I pray God if if if your Holy Ghost was
[1:43:21] falling in 1964, it's still falling
[1:43:24] today. Why? Because the door is still
[1:43:26] open. I want the Holy GHOST MOVING IN MY
[1:43:28] LIFE, MOVING in my church, moving in my
[1:43:30] family. Uh not just between these four
[1:43:33] walls, but when I GO OUT OF HERE, I WANT
[1:43:35] THE HOLY GHOST MOVING in my life. Amen.
[1:43:38] Do you you agree with that?
[1:43:42] But you know, the problem is that if
[1:43:44] we're not careful, we get stuck between
[1:43:45] two opinions and we we we we want to we
[1:43:48] want to be the judge of what is God and
[1:43:50] what's not of God.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Is it just emotion? Is it not just
[1:43:54] emotion? I I tell you what, I I don't
[1:43:57] know anything about all that. Alls I
[1:43:58] know is I once was lost
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; and I was in a real bad situation
[1:44:05] and I I couldn't get out of it.
[1:44:11] But oh, the Bible said, "If you call on
[1:44:13] the name of the Lord, you shall be
[1:44:14] saved."
[1:44:16] And I come to find out God is not a man
[1:44:19] that he should lie.
[1:44:22] And he lifted me up out of the muck and
[1:44:24] mire. And he started to clean up my life
[1:44:28] and said, "It's okay. No, that don't
[1:44:30] matter. Let me wash you by the water of
[1:44:32] the word. You never did it in the first
[1:44:35] place." No, you don't worry about that.
[1:44:37] No. What What are you talking about?
[1:44:39] Why do you keep MENTIONING THESE THINGS?
[1:44:41] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
[1:44:42] ABOUT.
[1:44:44] And what did he start TO DO? HE STARTED
[1:44:45] TO READ HIS WILL out over my life.
[1:44:49] He filled me with the Holy Ghost and put
[1:44:51] me into service.
[1:44:54] So I I all I know is I've heard from my
[1:44:58] theophony.
[1:45:00] If there's there if there's victory,
[1:45:02] it's mine. If there's healing, it's
[1:45:05] mine. IF THERE'S DEEP CONSECRATION, IT'S
[1:45:08] MINE. If there's humility and meekness,
[1:45:10] IT'S MINE. IT'S ALL MINE. EVERY BIT OF
[1:45:12] IT'S MINE. The joy, the scream, AND THE
[1:45:15] SHOUTING, IT'S ALL MINE. And the
[1:45:16] meekness and the humility AND THE
[1:45:18] SOVEREIGN OF THE STILL SMALL VOICE IS
[1:45:20] MINE. IT'S ALL MINE. I JUST WANT TO live
[1:45:23] in it. I want to breathe IT. I WANT TO
[1:45:25] ENJOY EVERY SINGLE PART OF IT. AND I
[1:45:28] DON'T WANT TO BE THE CRITIC.
[1:45:32] I I can't be
[1:45:34] cuz I know what he did for me.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not in a position where I can say,
[1:45:40] "Well, that's he's just doing that
[1:45:41] because of this and you know that's just
[1:45:43] this and that." No, I just want to sit
[1:45:46] back and say, "Oh, God, I believe you're
[1:45:48] doing for him what you did for me."
[1:45:50] You know, some things I don't understand
[1:45:53] and some things we do understand because
[1:45:55] we've been properly taught. But one
[1:45:56] thing I know we want, we just want to
[1:45:58] see the will of God moving in all of our
[1:46:00] lives. And I say, you know what, my if
[1:46:03] the prophet could preach spiritual
[1:46:05] amnesia here in [music] 1964, I believe
[1:46:08] it was. And a and and I I I say, you
[1:46:11] know what, Lord, I want your Holy Spirit
[1:46:13] moving in my life. And if if the seals
[1:46:16] can be open and here HE'S SHOWING US
[1:46:18] THAT, OH, YOU CAN HAVE ALL THIS
[1:46:19] KNOWLEDGE, but you know, you can still
[1:46:20] get spiritual amnesia.
[1:46:25] Lord, have I forgotten?
[1:46:27] Have I forgotten what the character of
[1:46:29] the message is supposed to look like in
[1:46:30] my life?
[1:46:32] Lord, have I let it become routine? Have
[1:46:34] I?
[1:46:36] Have I lost the joy of my salvation?
[1:46:42] Have I forgot how you want to manifest
[1:46:45] yourself in the way that I dress and the
[1:46:47] way that I act?
[1:46:50] Have I kind of made it all about me and
[1:46:52] I
[1:46:53] I forgot to make it all about you. Lord,
[1:46:56] I say, Lord, forgive me. Just as you
[1:46:59] prayed for these people, let's just all
[1:47:01] bow our heads.
[1:47:03] Lord, just as you
[1:47:06] prayed for
[1:47:10] these believers
[1:47:14] through your prophet, Lord, you said
[1:47:17] they had a a case of spiritual amnesia,
[1:47:22] Lord. And you were preaching that
[1:47:26] message for me,
[1:47:28] letting me know as your son that
[1:47:31] there is a disease called spiritual
[1:47:33] amnesia. And if we're not careful,
[1:47:37] situations and family crisis and
[1:47:42] bad decisions can can shock us.
[1:47:48] We forget who we are.
[1:47:51] If we forget what our inheritance is,
[1:47:58] Lord, just like your prophet showed that
[1:48:01] that old soldier boy who had amnesia,
[1:48:05] he got out of that train car and he got
[1:48:07] to looking around
[1:48:09] and he saw something familiar.
[1:48:13] Lord, thank you for this message.
[1:48:18] Lord, I saw something familiar.
[1:48:23] And I realized it was leading me back to
[1:48:25] my father,
[1:48:27] back to where I came from,
[1:48:30] Lord. And you're taking us all the way
[1:48:32] back
[1:48:33] before sin, back to an Eden condition.
[1:48:38] And Lord, we just want to surrender
[1:48:40] ourselves to you tonight and say, "Lord,
[1:48:43] forgive me if I've gotten a little
[1:48:45] spiritual amnesia." And I've allowed a
[1:48:48] pattern to set into my life to where I
[1:48:51] do good for a little while and then I
[1:48:53] kind of let off. And I'm starting to
[1:48:55] entertain things I I should entertain.
[1:48:57] And I realize, Lord, that you've come
[1:48:59] tonight to tell me I've got a little
[1:49:01] spiritual amnesia.
[1:49:02] I've I've got my eye off of the the
[1:49:04] reading of the will,
[1:49:06] Lord, that you've predestinated us unto
[1:49:08] adoption.
[1:49:10] And Lord, that that's our inheritance
[1:49:12] and that's our promise and that we can
[1:49:15] just tell that old devil, you've lost
[1:49:17] your hold.
[1:49:18] I'm remembering who I am because I've
[1:49:20] heard the message of the hour and it's
[1:49:23] telling me I don't belong in the
[1:49:24] chickenard.
[1:49:26] [snorts] Come up higher.
[1:49:28] come up out of the chicken yard and soar
[1:49:31] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:49:33] Lord, I just commit the people to you.
[1:49:35] May you just be their portion in Jesus
[1:49:37] Christ's name. Amen. Let's just [music]
[1:49:39] sing this song.
[1:49:44] Help me sing it.
[1:49:50] Chasm
[1:49:53] at white [music] between us.

[1:54:53] wonderful word.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I I just appreciate that because you
[1:55:00] know to to the way to come out of
[1:55:02] amnesia is to come in contact with
[1:55:05] something that sounds familiar.
[1:55:08] It is actually tracing back your steps
[1:55:10] and looking and looking and looking
[1:55:13] until that eagle heard something that
[1:55:16] sounded right. until that eagle heard
[1:55:19] something that was contrary to
[1:55:21] everything they were telling him. They
[1:55:23] told him, "If you heard that voice, run.
[1:55:26] Don't listen to it. It's coming to eat
[1:55:28] you up." And the chicken heard the
[1:55:31] voice. All of them run. All of the
[1:55:34] sudden, the eagle hears the voice.
[1:55:37] Instead of running, all of the sudden,
[1:55:39] the voice makes sense. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; I I tell you, you could never figure out
[1:55:46] this message.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; You can study all you want. You will
[1:55:51] never figure it out. You will never line
[1:55:53] it all up just perfectly so you can
[1:55:56] believe it. It has to be something that
[1:55:59] you hear that don't make any sense, but
[1:56:02] you believe it anyway.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; It's something in THE HEART IS JUST
[1:56:06] TELLING YOU IT'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE
[1:56:08] OF THE THEOLOGY OF IT, BUT you were made
[1:56:11] to believe it.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; That's what takes away the amnesia. It
[1:56:17] It's not the the Let me say this.
[1:56:19] There's a lot of people that came in
[1:56:20] contact with this word. THEY STUDIED IT.
[1:56:23] THEY STUDIED it and they studied it.
[1:56:25] They stated it. Later on, they said,
[1:56:27] "Oh, guess what? It's not right."
[1:56:31] Really? 20, 30 years. It's you didn't
[1:56:34] FIND IT RIGHT. BUT WHAT? WHAT? WHY ARE
[1:56:37] YOU HERE TONIGHT? WHY ARE YOU HERE? IS
[1:56:40] IT BECAUSE YOU STUDIED IT ALL AND CAME
[1:56:42] UP WITH THE SAME CONCLUSION? NO. THERE'S
[1:56:44] SOMETHING IN IT THAT'S made to draw you
[1:56:47] in. There's something that's daily
[1:56:50] communicating and speaking to you. What
[1:56:52] is he doing? He's taking away the
[1:56:54] amnesia out of you. He's bringing the
[1:56:57] TRUE IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT YOU WERE
[1:56:59] SUPPOSED TO BE to begin with.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take away from you. Nobody.
[1:57:06] Nobody can bring you in and nobody can
[1:57:08] take you out. It's the voice of the
[1:57:11] bridegroom and only the bride can
[1:57:13] understand it.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He says my sheep hears my voice and now
[1:57:19] that they will not follow. Why is he
[1:57:22] made it so that your heart is calibrated
[1:57:25] to hear it and it makes sense.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; And I say that's the greatest blessing
[1:57:32] we've ever had on this face of the
[1:57:34] earth. And I want to say this. If that's
[1:57:37] true, let's eat it.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Let's drink it. Let it play in your
[1:57:42] house. Let it play in your car. Hear it.
[1:57:45] Feed of it. I I tell you, YOU BECOME
[1:57:48] WHAT YOU FEED ON. You become what you
[1:57:51] feed on. YOU HEAR IT TUNED SOMEWHERE.
[1:57:54] ALL OF THE SUDDEN YOUR BODY even
[1:57:56] unknowingly it comes out. HOW MUCH MORE
[1:57:59] IF WE STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD EVERY
[1:58:01] DAY? I TELL YOU, YOU WOULD SPEAK. YOU
[1:58:04] WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN VOCABULARY.
[1:58:06] YOU WILL TALK THE WORD. YOU WILL THINK
[1:58:08] THE WORD. YOU WILL WALK THE WORD. YOUR
[1:58:10] YOUR BODY, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU WILL
[1:58:12] CHANGE. WHY? Because that's what you are
[1:58:15] in contact with every day.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't let the darkness
[1:58:21] affect you. You have a hiding place.
[1:58:24] When when IT GETS SO DARK AND WHEN YOU
[1:58:27] FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T come to your into
[1:58:29] your hiding place, he he's here. He's
[1:58:32] made a way FOR YOU TO AVOID ALL OF THAT
[1:58:35] THAT'S HAPPENING. HE'S COME OUT AND TOOK
[1:58:37] YOU OUT OF Laudisia and set you aside
[1:58:40] into a special place where you can look
[1:58:42] at the darkness that's going on and say,
[1:58:44] "Thank God I'm not affected by it.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; He's made you so you can look those that
[1:58:50] are in darkness and they look at you and
[1:58:52] you become light to them.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; You become their only source of light.
[1:58:57] they can look at you and see this is
[1:59:00] what actually makes sense to me. This is
[1:59:02] what it means to be a Christian.
[1:59:06] All of this I mean you know I I I feel
[1:59:09] like people in the last days there are
[1:59:11] Christians waiting to whatever
[1:59:15] opportunity comes up they take it. They
[1:59:18] call themselves Christians but yet they
[1:59:20] live by any opportunity out there. We
[1:59:24] are Christians that only live by this.
[1:59:26] If he spoke it, we believe it. If he
[1:59:28] didn't speak it, we don't want anything
[1:59:30] to do with it. I say, we've been
[1:59:32] encouraged by the word of God today.
[1:59:34] We've been brought up in the heavenly
[1:59:36] places tonight. Let me say that, stay
[1:59:39] there.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Stay in heavenly places. Don't let the
[1:59:43] world drag you down and in the mud. No.
[1:59:46] Stay in heavenly. Surround yourself with
[1:59:49] your heavenly places. Make your house a
[1:59:52] heavenly place. Make your car a HEAVENLY
[1:59:54] PLACE. MAKE YOUR ATMOSPHERE at work a
[1:59:57] HEAVENLY PLACE. SURROUND. DON'T DON'T
[1:59:59] GET OUT OF THAT ATMOSPHERE.
[2:00:01] Stay in it and let it become a reality
[2:00:04] every day. So those that will look at
[2:00:06] you, they will see that Christ is once
[2:00:09] again living. Amen. [music] Amen. Let's
[2:00:11] sing that song. Our God reigns. I
[2:00:13] believe it's a flat.
[2:00:18] All lovely
[2:00:20] on
[2:00:24] the mountains
[2:00:26] are the feet

[2:05:48] Amen.
[2:05:51] Let's bow our hearts.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, we just come
[2:05:57] before you this evening, Lord.
[2:06:00] Lord, just wonderful messages that we
[2:06:02] heard from today from you, Lord.
[2:06:07] Lord, may we have the right reaction to
[2:06:09] your word, Lord.
[2:06:12] Father, your [music] prophet taught us
[2:06:14] that
[2:06:16] the spirit of America's laughter and to
[2:06:18] laugh things off and to [snorts] be
[2:06:21] jokey. And Lord, we're to be serious,
[2:06:24] Lord.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; And Father, we heard tonight in that
[2:06:27] tape, he said, "If you're lukewarm,
[2:06:30] he'll spill you out of his mouth." And
[2:06:32] that's what he'll do. He said, "Lord, we
[2:06:35] don't want to be lukewarm. Lord, we want
[2:06:37] to be what you called us to be, what you
[2:06:39] predestinated us to be. Lord, may we
[2:06:42] have the faith to step into that, Lord.
[2:06:46] May you lead and guide us and
[2:06:51] give us a vision, Lord, that we not
[2:06:53] perish. Lord, we love you. We just thank
[2:06:56] you. We ask that you'd bless
[2:06:59] Brother Cosman and Brother Matthew, all
[2:07:01] that they've given today. Hey Lord, may
[2:07:02] you restore upon upon them, Lord.
[2:07:05] Father, we just ask that you go go with
[2:07:08] us from here [music] and protect us,
[2:07:11] Lord. If you Terry and we meet again,
[2:07:13] Lord, may you come and just minister to
[2:07:15] our hearts once again. We're just so
[2:07:17] thankful of the word we heard. May it be
[2:07:20] just an everpresent
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; living God [music] coming out of us,
[2:07:25] Lord, and touching others and changing
[2:07:28] lives and calling those last ones in so
[2:07:31] we can go home, Lord.
[2:07:34] Lord, we just thank you so much in Jesus
[2:07:37] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I dismissed KFC.
[2:07:47] Why don't we sing that song? And if the
[2:07:48] same spirit that dwell in Jesus, oh if
[2:07:52] the same
[2:07:54] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[2:07:57] dwell in you, [music]
[2:08:01] dwell in you.
[2:08:03] Oh, if the same [music]
[2:08:06] spirit that raised Christ from his dead
[2:08:10] in you,
[2:08:13] dwell in you.
