[39:21] word then living your
[39:24] word father our hearts bubble with joy
[39:27] joy that you've chosen us
[39:33] to and gave us Revelation that we might
[39:38] see at this great ending of
[39:42] time the path to
[39:45] Glory we're so thankful for that and
[39:49] Lord may we appreciate every brother
[39:53] sister that Associates themselves with
[39:56] the furtherance of this gospel may we
[40:00] pray for one another be in the unity of
[40:03] one another father the little
[40:06] differences father
[40:08] there we don't let it affect our
[40:12] heart and our
[40:15] love Lord we just want to magnify you
[40:19] and all that we do and the way that we
[40:23] worship we just ask you to bless us in
[40:26] Jesus name name we pray amen amen let's
[40:31] open our Bibles to the book of Filman
[40:33] and just read that first verse and just
[40:36] trust the Lord will bless us some more
[40:40] amen and uh that verse is very simple
[40:45] and it but as as our Prophet said he he
[40:48] prayed he said that the Holy Spirit
[40:51] would uh reveal to us what the intention
[40:56] was when Paul Paul said Paul a prisoner
[40:59] and and I just that really um and he
[41:01] made another statement we heard this
[41:03] morning he says it takes the Holy Spirit
[41:06] to reveal what the intention of the word
[41:10] was really what it was that was spoken
[41:13] he said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[41:17] and Timothy our brother unto filmon our
[41:21] dearly beloved and fellow labor God
[41:24] bless you you may be seated
[41:29] you know we mentioned uh this morning
[41:32] that uh the word of God is always a
[41:36] paradox you know it just it's so
[41:38] marvelous brother BR makes this
[41:40] statement he says and the same thing we
[41:42] find today we did come through a
[41:46] denominational age as we proved through
[41:50] the church ages the Bible and so forth
[41:55] but now we come now to a free age where
[42:01] the Holy Spirit himself comes down and
[42:05] vindicates himself and makes himself
[42:09] known makes every promise that he
[42:13] promised come to pass oh my what a great
[42:18] time Hallelujah but you know it's a
[42:21] great time for the believer when he
[42:24] begins to see the word word of
[42:29] God coming to pass all around him and he
[42:33] knows
[42:34] it you know I mean it's terrible to be
[42:39] in the dark if I could say that you know
[42:42] the expression I I I nobody told me you
[42:45] know I'm I'm totally in the dark you
[42:48] know what's going on and then when you
[42:50] see it it's beautiful but you know but
[42:54] in all those things he talked about the
[42:57] there's no freedom in
[42:59] denomination because you can't have
[43:01] Revelation outside of what they believe
[43:04] and that's what we're free we're free
[43:06] for God to reveal to us all of his great
[43:10] word and then and just another statement
[43:13] or two and then we'll finish our the
[43:16] message that we listened to he's talking
[43:19] of Paul here now he'd become imprisoned
[43:23] to something a a prison so so after
[43:27] comparing it and seeing no wonder he
[43:31] could write the book of Hebrews in a
[43:33] type see three and a
[43:36] half three years and a half down there
[43:41] lying in the word and finding out that
[43:45] the very God that called him was taking
[43:49] him back and changing all of his
[43:54] intellect changing all all that he ever
[44:00] thought all that he had trained to be
[44:03] all his Ambitions just wiped it away
[44:07] from him and he become a prisoner the
[44:11] love of God had been so
[44:14] tremendous and such a revelation that he
[44:18] could not get away from it just think of
[44:22] it Paul sat there and and and God was
[44:26] revealing
[44:27] this great truth about who the Lord
[44:31] Jesus Christ was the great truth being
[44:34] revealed to him and he said the love
[44:38] that God would reveal to me this great
[44:42] truth he just sat there could you
[44:44] imagine as his eyes were being opened
[44:47] and and here he's killing the very
[44:50] trying to wipe out the very Jesus that
[44:54] you know everything became vice versa
[44:57] yeah but he wasn't down about that he
[45:01] was rejoicing in it amen just think how
[45:05] would you like to went down there and
[45:07] finally got to the end of the road and
[45:10] find out everything you did was really
[45:14] contrary to what you really wanted to do
[45:17] but to have his eyes open was just a
[45:21] blessing to him he was so thankful that
[45:24] he could see he said it was the love of
[45:27] God he said and that's the true
[45:31] experience of every real believer who
[45:36] meets God you come in contact with
[45:40] something that's so
[45:43] great that you become a prisoner to
[45:48] everything else see you get away from
[45:52] everything and imprison yourself to this
[45:58] amen when we saw Jesus standing in his
[46:00] word in this day putting his foot on the
[46:03] land and the Sea taking the book opening
[46:07] the seals revealing himself in the
[46:10] church ages and all the third pole that
[46:13] was revealed to us we just sit back and
[46:16] go praise
[46:17] God Amen this is wonderful that's the
[46:21] joy of our
[46:23] heart you know it's not the battles we
[46:25] have in the flesh that's not what
[46:28] Thrills us but one day we'll be free
[46:30] from them but it's the the revelation of
[46:33] God's
[46:35] word that's why he told Peter he said
[46:38] Peter who do you say that I am and he
[46:40] said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[46:42] living God he said Flesh and Blood
[46:44] didn't reveal this to you but my Father
[46:47] which is in heaven this is what I'm
[46:49] going to build my church on I'm going to
[46:51] build my church on God revealing himself
[46:56] in his word word and then just think
[46:58] when he does that for you that's what
[47:01] makes you the church you can keep all
[47:05] the rules just so perfectly but it it'll
[47:11] never do you I guess any good or it
[47:14] won't bring you the joy that real
[47:17] Revelation brings you I that just
[47:20] Thrills your heart do that this makes
[47:22] you so happy he says you imprison
[47:25] yourself to this it's expressed one time
[47:28] where Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven
[47:32] is like a man buying pearls then when he
[47:35] finds that Pearl great Pearl he sells
[47:39] all that he's got to get that one and
[47:43] that's the way
[47:46] here now it it something how how brother
[47:49] Ram expresses that that's the way here
[47:52] the way you get
[47:54] here to that perfect joy that perfect
[47:58] peace being empowered by
[48:02] Revelation that's the way you get here
[48:04] you sell everything out for this one
[48:07] great
[48:09] thing and you know it's hard if if you
[48:12] know people that have been in churches
[48:14] for years and years and years and and
[48:17] maybe in a denominational church or uh
[48:20] in a certain fellowship or a certain
[48:23] group and years and years and years
[48:26] every all their friendship all their
[48:28] child friendship all their social life
[48:31] uh everything about the way that they do
[48:35] things they everything they know all of
[48:39] a sudden their eyes are opened and it
[48:43] it's kind of like it's it's taken away
[48:47] from them but they found that which is
[48:50] so precious that they they have to give
[48:54] all that up and they don't give it up
[48:57] with malice they don't give it up with
[48:59] bitterness they follow after their heart
[49:02] praying that God would Open the Eyes of
[49:06] all those that they've been around uh
[49:10] for for so long and and I remember when
[49:14] I first came to the message uh I I wrote
[49:18] the Catholic church and and the bishop
[49:21] and I said take my name off that book I
[49:24] said I don't want no remembrance of me
[49:27] that I ever was an altar boy that I ever
[49:30] did mass that I ever went to Catholic
[49:32] school I said I want my identity sealed
[49:36] up amen cuz I'm taking on a new identity
[49:40] they probably laughed you know but it
[49:42] felt good to me you know and and when
[49:46] you first come into it you know that's
[49:48] that that's when you do you know you
[49:50] just do everything you know what I'm
[49:52] saying I I remember when when lesie got
[49:56] converted it and and of course you know
[49:59] sometimes your Zeal uh outdoes your
[50:03] wisdom you know but she had a
[50:06] complete vinyl set in original form of
[50:11] all the beetle albums you know what I
[50:14] mean probably not worth much probably 50
[50:17] 60
[50:19] 70,000 um but we took it to the
[50:22] dump cuz it had no value to us you know
[50:26] what I me and she'll kind of Raz me
[50:29] every now and then you know he said we
[50:31] could have got this if he didn't throw
[50:32] all my Beetle
[50:34] out away you know and and uh uh and I
[50:39] remember I had a a portrait that artist
[50:43] painted of uh Bob Dylan on my wall and
[50:47] he painted it right on my wall of my
[50:49] house um and uh so when I got rid of I
[50:53] was going to paint over it and he said
[50:55] please don't paint over it so he went
[50:57] and they saw my whole wall out cut the
[50:59] sheetrock and everything and that thing
[51:01] sold for lots of money you know what I
[51:04] mean but you wanted to pay the price
[51:07] whatever it took there was nothing that
[51:10] compared in value to this
[51:14] word and you know we heard that we we
[51:17] listened to choosing of the bride and
[51:19] man we sold everything we had we had
[51:22] antiques we had everything and we bought
[51:25] a school bus and a few bags of beans and
[51:30] and got in the school bus and off the
[51:32] Montana we went and uh you know John
[51:36] knows about California you know uh there
[51:41] was a movie when we were growing up we
[51:43] were Surfers and it was called Endless
[51:45] Summer and and the guy that filmed it
[51:48] and the Surfers and everybody in it all
[51:51] John's friends and buddies and and uh
[51:54] but you know when when we we heard that
[51:57] California we believe what the prophet
[51:59] said so we sold everything we had and
[52:03] got in a bus and drove to
[52:05] Montana again Zeal outd does wisdom you
[52:09] know what I mean I I didn't know Arizona
[52:11] was so
[52:13] close but I took a detour up through
[52:16] Montana and ended up in Arizona anyway
[52:20] but uh uh that's that's just what you do
[52:24] you know what I mean you're so glad you
[52:26] see aren't you glad you
[52:29] see I mean could you imagine sitting
[52:33] under the
[52:35] deception of Trinity
[52:38] Doctrine or under the deception of what
[52:41] the evidence of the holy spirit is or
[52:44] under the fear of of of of a certain
[52:48] Ministry that that you're so terrified
[52:52] of it you you know what I mean that uh
[52:56] uh if the phone rang and it's the pastor
[52:59] you sit back and you say oh no what did
[53:01] I do you know what I mean and it's not
[53:04] what you did the pastor dialed the wrong
[53:06] number you know what I mean but you you
[53:09] you get the Willies because of it you
[53:12] know what I mean can you imagine being
[53:13] free from all that at peace in your
[53:17] heart peace that you that nobody can
[53:20] take away from you a peace that Sur
[53:23] paaths understanding a rest because you
[53:27] found the
[53:29] truth arrest that you have an
[53:32] absolute all the men and all the
[53:35] preachers can argue but you've got a
[53:38] place you can go to you can read it for
[53:42] yourself no big eyes no little 's it's
[53:47] yours and if you're old enough to read
[53:50] you're old enough to
[53:52] read and you're old enough to read
[53:56] amen it it and he promised that if you
[54:00] would search the scriptures that you
[54:03] would find him in there and he'd speak
[54:06] to you and it's a living fountain that
[54:10] comes out of this Bible you can
[54:12] underline one scripture and underline it
[54:15] and un and go back and read it again and
[54:18] and you have to go get a different color
[54:20] marker because now it means something
[54:23] new to you you know and and pretty soon
[54:27] you you've underlined and marked that
[54:30] scripture so many times it's a fountain
[54:33] of Many Colors and that's what the Lord
[54:35] is he's a great Fountain of Many Colors
[54:38] he's just a wonderful and so he that's
[54:41] what he said he
[54:43] said he says that's that's the way here
[54:48] you have an intellectual
[54:50] conception and you have a theological
[54:54] experience but when it comes to a time
[54:59] that when you really find the real thing
[55:04] you just sell out everything else and
[55:08] you close yourself into
[55:12] this Amen in other words you you shut
[55:16] out all the
[55:18] voices and everybody that I've seen
[55:21] that's left this
[55:24] message it's because they never saw
[55:27] Jesus Christ in
[55:30] it they they never saw actually saw him
[55:36] in there that it was him and they opened
[55:41] themselves out up to other
[55:45] voices and and after all the years of
[55:48] listening to the
[55:51] message that's
[55:53] exactly
[55:54] what he said eve fell by was by
[56:00] reasoning and here they let a voice come
[56:04] along and speak to him them and they
[56:07] start
[56:08] reasoning and and and they've been
[56:11] taught All Through the Ages that that's
[56:15] the problem right if you've got the
[56:18] Revelation you didn't come to that
[56:21] Revelation yourself it was given to you
[56:24] by God it's been prove to you you don't
[56:28] need nothing
[56:29] else on that one basis you accept
[56:33] everything that said
[56:35] amen and he just keeps it grows you just
[56:39] there's no
[56:41] no room you just don't have room to hear
[56:44] anything different because you're sold
[56:46] out and that's what's what's so
[56:49] beautiful he says you're sold out to
[56:52] this and then he he went on he said and
[56:55] today is Servants of Christ we become
[56:57] harnessed hooked up we can't go we're
[57:02] logged in with it harnessed to the word
[57:08] no matter what anyone else says you're
[57:11] harnessed to it there is something about
[57:15] it that you just can't get away from it
[57:20] you've been yolked up with it by the
[57:23] Holy Ghost has yolked you to the word no
[57:27] matter what anybody else says it's the
[57:31] word it's always harnessed up with it
[57:37] there's always harnessed up with it put
[57:40] in the Yoke with it the word by the
[57:44] spirit he has
[57:46] harnessed amen I like that don't you so
[57:51] much and he says and we find now that's
[57:55] where we find mind today that we must be
[57:58] stripped first and people don't want to
[58:02] be stripped the mess brother wants to
[58:05] hold to a little bit of his Methodist
[58:09] teaching huh the Baptist brother wants
[58:13] to hold to a little bit of his Baptist
[58:16] teaching see but you've got to be
[58:20] absolutely stripped of
[58:23] everything and just born again
[58:27] aresh and take up from there let the
[58:32] Holy Spirit lead you can't say well now
[58:36] my daddy said when he got in and went to
[58:41] church and shook hands with the pastor
[58:45] he was a good loyal member that might
[58:48] have been all right for his
[58:51] race but we've but but we're another
[58:57] race in other words you run the race
[59:00] that's set before you we have a
[59:02] different course to run in our age we're
[59:05] not running the course of any age the
[59:08] Pentecostal age the Methodist age any
[59:12] the age we have a whole brand
[59:15] new
[59:16] path for us to be led down and he
[59:20] elected the people to go down this path
[59:24] and and when you realize it's him and
[59:27] it's him that called you it settles it
[59:31] down the road you go Hallelujah you know
[59:34] what I mean you you you don't you don't
[59:37] care where it's leading you because you
[59:39] know the road's
[59:41] right amen you know and you know every
[59:44] other road goes off the cliff you might
[59:47] not be able to see tomorrow but you
[59:49] don't need to know tomorrow the evil of
[59:52] the day is sufficient thereof you just
[59:54] take this road you're on it you know
[59:56] it's him you know he's leading you you
[59:59] know this is a go you don't know where
[1:00:00] it goes but you don't you but you know
[1:00:02] it's the right Road and you're just not
[1:00:05] looking for a way to get out that's
[1:00:07] right amen you're want to Lord Keep Me
[1:00:09] on it you know just keep me safe and
[1:00:12] then he says that he
[1:00:15] says he
[1:00:17] says
[1:00:20] uh and you say it's all right he says
[1:00:23] but that's another race now we must come
[1:00:25] back back to the Bible times for this
[1:00:31] day amen so that was that was kind of
[1:00:35] what we're we're we're talking about
[1:00:36] this morning Paul had such a revelation
[1:00:40] that this was God that it yoked them up
[1:00:43] to him and so we talked about Paul then
[1:00:46] brother Bram he he closed out how that
[1:00:48] we've got to be born again how we've got
[1:00:51] to uh God's looking for prisoners that's
[1:00:54] what he's looking for
[1:00:57] he's looking for people that have the
[1:00:58] same experience that Paul has that sees
[1:01:02] the word knows the truth knows the
[1:01:05] path and on it
[1:01:08] 100% not listening to any other voices
[1:01:11] where it goes I go wasn't that what
[1:01:14] Elijah said he said wherever you go I'll
[1:01:16] go I'll be with you I'm not going to
[1:01:18] leave your side amen he knew that there
[1:01:21] was no other Fountain out there and he
[1:01:24] stuck with it so sold out to it that it
[1:01:29] was passed down to him isn't that the
[1:01:33] promise of the church The Works that
[1:01:35] I'll do you shall do
[1:01:39] also isn't that the promise of the Bride
[1:01:42] that the bride and the word will become
[1:01:45] one well it that Union is not going to
[1:01:48] take place until the bride quits
[1:01:51] flirting with anything else out there
[1:01:55] that's right
[1:01:56] no moves of the spirit no uh seemingly
[1:02:00] great revivals no other voices no other
[1:02:03] teachings they've got their
[1:02:05] absolute they've got their voice they're
[1:02:08] sold
[1:02:09] out and when and when they totally sold
[1:02:13] out then they'll become one and when
[1:02:16] they become one they'll they'll have the
[1:02:19] works for our age a living Bible for our
[1:02:24] age so he talked about Paul doing that
[1:02:27] and and uh being totally sold
[1:02:30] out just and and just separating and
[1:02:35] keep cut and loose until everything's
[1:02:37] cut loose and so we we listen to Paul's
[1:02:40] testimony and now we're going to pick up
[1:02:43] on page
[1:02:44] 118 ver I'm sorry um paragraph 118 page
[1:02:50] 17 and he's going to start talking about
[1:02:53] Moses and other great uh uh great
[1:03:00] uh
[1:03:01] uh Bible characters that sold out for
[1:03:07] this gospel and uh and then I believe we
[1:03:10] have another baptism after service but I
[1:03:13] kind of want you to just
[1:03:15] to um just from an experience standpoint
[1:03:20] to listen how brother brandom closes his
[1:03:24] Services no you know even after some of
[1:03:26] the greatest sermons that brother
[1:03:28] brandham preaches the close of brother
[1:03:30] brandham Services is all very
[1:03:33] simple you know and um and and it it
[1:03:38] just I just want to throw that out there
[1:03:41] to for it to be noticed you know I'm not
[1:03:45] criticizing how anybody Clos services or
[1:03:48] how we close service I know we like to
[1:03:50] sing and we like to worship but uh
[1:03:54] brother Brandon was a very matter of a
[1:03:56] fact type person I just thought you
[1:03:59] might want to just think about that a
[1:04:02] little bit and uh uh cuz sometimes
[1:04:06] people feel that if you don't have a
[1:04:07] great big close out you haven't had a
[1:04:10] service amen the servic is before the
[1:04:13] close out you know what I mean uh but
[1:04:17] anyway uh Lord bless you I'm glad you're
[1:04:21] here and those of you that have come out
[1:04:23] tonight I hope that uh listening
[1:04:26] to the voice of God for this age a real
[1:04:31] Prophet a real
[1:04:34] angel amen one that had the ministry of
[1:04:38] the son of man in other words a man that
[1:04:41] had the ministry of veiling deity may
[1:04:45] you enjoy his words tonight and and so
[1:04:50] uh you can read along so God richly
[1:04:51] bless you our Prophet the servant of the
[1:04:55] Lord William
[1:04:57] Brown Moses know that he was born to
[1:05:00] deliver he knew that and did you notice
[1:05:05] with the ambition that Moses had knowing
[1:05:08] his mother had told him over there she
[1:05:10] was his nurse maid no doubt when Moses
[1:05:13] the little baby was born that his mother
[1:05:16] said you know Moses when your dad amran
[1:05:22] and I pray constantly we know what he's
[1:05:25] seen in the word it was time for the
[1:05:28] coming of the deliverer and we pray Lord
[1:05:31] God we want to see that deliverer one
[1:05:34] night the Lord told us in EP visiion
[1:05:37] that you would be born and you'd be
[1:05:39] delivered we mustn't play to the king's
[1:05:42] commandment we didn't care what the king
[1:05:43] said then we know that you were born a
[1:05:46] deliverer now Moses we know that we
[1:05:49] could bring you ight I remember they've
[1:05:51] been down there 400 years in Egypt see
[1:05:54] and we we wanted to get you the the
[1:05:57] right thing the right education a right
[1:06:00] train so I took you and put you in a
[1:06:04] little Ark and set you out into the KN
[1:06:07] and how strange that the C taking that
[1:06:10] little Ark down through the Reeds and
[1:06:11] rushes and brought it right down miles
[1:06:14] away and turned it right into Pharaoh's
[1:06:16] Palace where his Pharaoh's daughter was
[1:06:20] uh where the bathing pool was and how
[1:06:23] that that I know that she need a woman
[1:06:26] to raise you and in them days of course
[1:06:28] they didn't have these BLS to raise the
[1:06:30] babies on so they have to have a wet
[1:06:33] nurse so and Mar him I S her down and
[1:06:36] she stood there and she said well I know
[1:06:38] where I can find a wet nurse and come
[1:06:40] and got me and Moses the doors are all
[1:06:43] shut honey you're 16 years old now and
[1:06:46] you're going to be Pharaoh's son and
[1:06:49] someday you're going to be the deliverer
[1:06:52] that's going to take the people out of
[1:06:54] here Moses Ambitions begin
[1:06:56] I'll study mother I'll study everything
[1:06:58] I can you know what I do I study how to
[1:07:01] be a military man and I don't know how
[1:07:04] to take these people out of here I'll be
[1:07:06] a great General Bishop so I know how
[1:07:09] it's done and I I'll take it out I'll
[1:07:13] get my PhD L I'll do
[1:07:16] it my father of sh if you ever ready
[1:07:20] Fook all right he's going to deliver all
[1:07:22] the Protestants you know need to come
[1:07:23] with himself so this great priest years
[1:07:27] ago father chin you to get his book read
[1:07:30] call him father and just brother chin
[1:07:32] what it was we don't call no father like
[1:07:35] that so we find it that we uh he's going
[1:07:38] to read the Bible so we can get out
[1:07:41] there and just through the pr of
[1:07:42] religion big all Catholic read the Bible
[1:07:45] the Holy Spirit come upon him he got the
[1:07:47] Holy Ghost hallah become one of so then
[1:07:53] notice this
[1:07:55] that Moses got all the training because
[1:07:59] he he knew he was so smart so educated
[1:08:03] and so intellectual there was nobody he
[1:08:06] can even teach the
[1:08:09] Egyptians he could teach the
[1:08:11] psychologist he could teach their the
[1:08:13] generals what military might was so he
[1:08:16] was a great man and people fear M
[1:08:20] because of his greatness so was such a
[1:08:22] scholarship mind he was Bishop like a
[1:08:26] pop he was a great fell and he was a a
[1:08:30] mighty man and he know that he was BL to
[1:08:34] do this and have trained with great
[1:08:36] Ambitions to do it just like today I
[1:08:39] don't say that man training in these
[1:08:42] schools I don't say that like you're out
[1:08:45] here in the west now they going to build
[1:08:48] 150
[1:08:50] million uh School of
[1:08:53] Theology see Pentecost
[1:08:56] a
[1:08:58] $150
[1:08:59] million
[1:09:02] school to me that should be missionaries
[1:09:05] in the
[1:09:06] field but whatever what do they do when
[1:09:09] they come out of there what are they
[1:09:11] bunch of Ricky just did that and then
[1:09:14] that's how they come out was always have
[1:09:15] the rest of them and that's the same
[1:09:17] line see now we find out that when uh
[1:09:22] Moses in all his training and they with
[1:09:25] all the training making big Bishops and
[1:09:29] so forth the great High Ambitions what
[1:09:31] do we do our Ambitions become just about
[1:09:35] like what Moses was
[1:09:37] see God before he could get the man in
[1:09:40] his hand he had the stripping of his
[1:09:44] ambition he had to stripping of all his
[1:09:47] training he did go out and he delivered
[1:09:51] he killed one
[1:09:53] Egyptian and he uh and when he did he
[1:09:56] found out that he was in the wrong he
[1:09:58] couldn't do that it wasn't that way and
[1:10:01] God had to take him out into the
[1:10:03] Wilderness into the
[1:10:05] desert a desert place you notice kind of
[1:10:10] strange how these Fells that God got a
[1:10:14] message for them he takes them into a
[1:10:18] desert he took Paul to the
[1:10:22] desert to train to tell about all this
[1:10:26] great vision walked out into the desert
[1:10:31] go out to a certain desert and he stayed
[1:10:33] there until God fully made know him what
[1:10:36] to do and M his time he took him out in
[1:10:40] the
[1:10:41] desert kept him out there for 40 years
[1:10:45] and stripped him of all his Theology and
[1:10:48] all his
[1:10:49] ambition oh what a time that he could
[1:10:53] look back and see his failure and how we
[1:10:57] tonight ought to do the same thing when
[1:11:00] we see our ambition look at the healing
[1:11:05] campaign as soon as the LA did something
[1:11:08] a few years ago to start restoring
[1:11:10] healing to the sick and so forth
[1:11:13] everybody every
[1:11:15] organization because it didn't come into
[1:11:17] their organization they had to get them
[1:11:19] A
[1:11:19] Healer and what have we done let's look
[1:11:22] at it just a moment we have done the
[1:11:25] same thing that Moses did we went out
[1:11:29] and tried so hard to manufacture some
[1:11:31] kind of America I smell a disease I I
[1:11:36] got blood in my hand and a manufactur a
[1:11:39] miracle Lord help see and what have we
[1:11:42] got some of the men in such large
[1:11:45] streams has broke up and become regular
[1:11:48] drunkers no and got the minds that
[1:11:52] switched all the way back to from the
[1:11:55] Pentecostal objectives back to making
[1:11:57] organizations and things again see what
[1:12:01] have we done through about one
[1:12:03] Egyptian yeah that's right and we tried
[1:12:07] we strained we paid we've labored all
[1:12:11] night long with pray meetings so we had
[1:12:13] no bi and and try to manufacture
[1:12:16] something soup up something and all
[1:12:18] these kinds of things and find it to be
[1:12:20] a total failure we here going back to
[1:12:23] the desert amen
[1:12:25] help yes
[1:12:29] sirs and
[1:12:32] struggles why I just give up amen that's
[1:12:35] what you ought to do amen go back and
[1:12:37] give up what we done the same thing they
[1:12:40] did same thing Moses did it doesn't do
[1:12:42] any good after 40 years he found himself
[1:12:46] a prisoner to the word of God what are
[1:12:49] we trying to do when the great blessing
[1:12:52] come out and the manifestation of all
[1:12:55] these great things that God has told us
[1:12:57] about how that we must be born again how
[1:13:01] we must receive the Holy Ghost the
[1:13:02] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:13:05] all these things here you see people
[1:13:07] instead of staying to that word
[1:13:09] harnessed to it what do they do they
[1:13:12] started with their own denominational
[1:13:14] Theory which has already
[1:13:16] failed and try to manufacture something
[1:13:18] to look like the truth oh help I better
[1:13:23] cut off right now see I'm I'm sure
[1:13:25] you're wise enough to know what I mean
[1:13:27] see but why look what it's done think of
[1:13:30] it what have we got tonight but a a a
[1:13:34] nation full of organized people who deny
[1:13:39] the scriptures of God Amen who would
[1:13:41] call the the the light of the holy
[1:13:44] spirit that it was a a mental
[1:13:47] tathy who would refuse such to come into
[1:13:50] their
[1:13:51] church and they wouldn't permit you to
[1:13:54] mention one more
[1:13:55] of C conceed eternal security and the
[1:13:57] things that the Holy Spirit has revealed
[1:13:59] and proved to be the word challenge
[1:14:02] after challenge to
[1:14:04] come what have he got the same thing
[1:14:07] that Luther had the rest of them see
[1:14:11] slew an Egyptian what was why was it
[1:14:14] maybe made some man start stop stealing
[1:14:17] or maybe live true to his
[1:14:20] wife but what did you make him out that
[1:14:22] a church member come and join our group
[1:14:26] see that stinking dead
[1:14:29] man was the only thing he app his
[1:14:31] fingers to of his success of 40 years of
[1:14:35] training a stinking Egyptian laying
[1:14:38] there rotten and dead that's about the
[1:14:41] way it is tonight only we can point to
[1:14:43] this rev this crossover soall is a
[1:14:45] stinking bunch of church members that
[1:14:47] knows more about God than a h all about
[1:14:50] egyp
[1:14:52] KN that we tell about the word of God
[1:14:54] that say I don't believe that I don't
[1:14:56] care what you say I don't believe it
[1:14:58] amen that's a an awful thing to have to
[1:15:01] point back to for all the streams and
[1:15:03] struggles and everything we got maybe we
[1:15:05] could point to a big school but it's
[1:15:07] dead amen we could point to an
[1:15:09] organization but it's dead it's stinking
[1:15:11] it's just like the first thing that we
[1:15:13] pulled out of like a going to water and
[1:15:16] a dog to his b we return
[1:15:19] back one dead Egyptian no doubt but
[1:15:23] somebody says Moses why hey you got no
[1:15:25] more feeling for the people you was
[1:15:27] called somebody that know Moses know he
[1:15:30] was called for that you lost the feeling

[1:16:29] Theologian did in the presence of the
[1:16:31] burning bush he only confess his
[1:16:34] inability
[1:16:36] amen when he seen the genuine purpose of
[1:16:39] God he confessed that he was in ability
[1:16:43] to do it yet he was trained in all the

[1:19:43] Moses to the will of God that's the same
[1:19:46] thing he done to Paul that right amen he
[1:19:50] harnessed Paul little crooked do
[1:19:53] sarcastic juice

[1:19:59] said I'm going to show him what he's
[1:20:01] going to suffer for the Lord's
[1:20:03] sake and and then Paul sitting there and
[1:20:07] seeing the
[1:20:08] word and seeing that was Jesus then he
[1:20:12] raise up his hands and become harnessed
[1:20:14] to him the love of God harnessed him to

[1:20:57] miracle done by it just like David with
[1:20:58] a
[1:20:59] slingshot harnessed himself and he went
[1:21:02] down finally God had a man that was
[1:21:07] subject to him Hornish to him and could
[1:21:10] not move until the word of God
[1:21:13] moved if people just do that today then
[1:21:16] he was his prisoner a prisoner of Love
[1:21:19] yoked up in the bond of love with with
[1:21:22] God as Paul was yoked up in the bond of
[1:21:25] love to God just like Paul both of them
[1:21:28] trained the same way Moses trained you
[1:21:31] know to deliver the children of Israel
[1:21:33] by military M Paul Cain to take them out
[1:21:37] of the hands of Romans and but them free
[1:21:40] by great ecclesiastical force in the
[1:21:42] world that day great schools of training
[1:21:44] come up under Gia and both of them went
[1:21:46] to the desert come back different man of
[1:21:51] them
[1:21:53] Father and both of them
[1:21:57] Prophet that right both of them
[1:22:01] prophet and they both was T to by the F
[1:22:04] of
[1:22:05] fire exactly right coming for
[1:22:08] deliverance there it was went to the
[1:22:10] desert left their homes and went to the
[1:22:12] desert to find out left their peoples
[1:22:15] and everything to find the will of God
[1:22:17] Amen see they were trained in one way
[1:22:20] God changed them to another and they had
[1:22:22] to become a complete prisoner to not act
[1:22:25] in the way that they wanted to act but
[1:22:27] act in the way that God wanted them to
[1:22:28] act he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:31] forever have we got another 10
[1:22:34] minutes I real quickly get to another
[1:22:36] character I see one before me now his
[1:22:40] name is
[1:22:41] Joseph he was an elected
[1:22:44] son he was a perfect type of Jesus
[1:22:48] Christ he was born a prophet he's a
[1:22:51] prophet also see and now he could see
[1:22:55] vision and when he's young little boy he
[1:22:57] saw a vision of himself sitting on the
[1:23:00] throne and his brothers
[1:23:04] D but what he would kind felt like he's
[1:23:08] a great guy see all of them but what did
[1:23:11] God have to do he done the same thing
[1:23:14] that he did to the rest of them because
[1:23:16] Moses was a deliverer Paul was a
[1:23:19] deliverer and how Joseph was a deliverer
[1:23:22] he saved his people from the fam what
[1:23:26] did God ask to do to him but he been
[1:23:28] prison right straight to the
[1:23:31] prison yes
[1:23:33] sir remember he was stole by his brother
[1:23:36] to an Egyptian and they sold him to
[1:23:38] poner and a poner uh give him a little
[1:23:41] bit of Liberty and uh first thing you
[1:23:44] know that was taken from him and they is
[1:23:46] set in the prison crying crying God had
[1:23:51] the stripping now notice but all all the
[1:23:54] time I believe he in that prison he can
[1:23:57] remember that the vision said that he's
[1:24:00] going to sh on the throne and his
[1:24:02] brothers is go to B because he knew that
[1:24:05] his gift come from God and he knew that
[1:24:08] it was had to come to pass if we could
[1:24:10] only keep that in our
[1:24:12] mind according to the word of God this
[1:24:15] say he's going to have a church going to
[1:24:18] have people and these things that he
[1:24:20] promised he's going to do them he's say
[1:24:23] one am and we're living in the time
[1:24:26] prise the Lord we're there amen he's
[1:24:29] just trying to get us to be real
[1:24:30] prisoners now locked in with him you
[1:24:33] heard that song you s and then I'm going
[1:24:35] to shut in with
[1:24:36] God I want to be shut in with
[1:24:39] God now where I thought about this being
[1:24:43] shut in with God nothing else you only
[1:24:47] move and God says move you only do as
[1:24:50] God says do then you're shut in with God
[1:24:53] now remember he was thinking he also
[1:24:57] became a total failure to
[1:25:00] himself all that he knew all that he
[1:25:03] understood and everything he become a
[1:25:05] total failure it didn't work he was put
[1:25:08] under a
[1:25:09] situation to that nobody would listen to
[1:25:13] him he was a
[1:25:16] prisoner see he was put into a
[1:25:19] situation that
[1:25:21] unbelievers would not believe
[1:25:27] his
[1:25:27] ministry was the
[1:25:31] matter the people turn their
[1:25:34] head they wouldn't pay no attention to
[1:25:36] him in
[1:25:38] prison what good bu's Ministry do he
[1:25:42] might stand to the prison bar and preach
[1:25:43] for him they walk on down the street see
[1:25:46] but he become a
[1:25:48] prisoner God a prisoner until the wheel
[1:25:54] amen GL
[1:25:57] Hallelujah faure
[1:26:01] finally God came to him in his prison
[1:26:04] like Paul like all rest he came to him
[1:26:09] and he used the gift that he had given
[1:26:11] him to get him out of there that's right
[1:26:15] he brought him from his
[1:26:17] prison what did he do as soon as he
[1:26:21] brought him from his prison he was get
[1:26:25] power amen by the king his
[1:26:28] King that he set on the side of that he
[1:26:31] was under he was brought from the prison
[1:26:34] house and given power to whatever he
[1:26:38] said had to

[1:26:49] purpose he was going to set King and all
[1:26:53] the rest of us going to need to him his
[1:26:56] vision told him
[1:26:58] so but before his vision could be
[1:27:01] completely FF he had become a
[1:27:04] prisoner then become a
[1:27:07] ruler and when he come from his prison
[1:27:10] house and become a prisoner of the word
[1:27:14] of God that he can only say what God
[1:27:16] said he his not to
[1:27:18] say then God move

[1:27:56] pleasure to God
[1:28:01] Hall oh I just got about three more
[1:28:04] minutes I keep my
[1:28:06] word now we find
[1:28:10] out that he he become a prisoner to God
[1:28:14] from the prison to the world from Paul
[1:28:17] the same way and Moses the same way from
[1:28:20] a prisoner to his own thinking to a
[1:28:22] prisoner to God and when he come out he
[1:28:25] had the power of God and when he become
[1:28:28] part when the own thinking of Moses he
[1:28:31] was surrendered it and stri of it he

[1:28:36] only move whereever you say Christ he
[1:28:39] has se the repo of Christ greater
[1:28:41] Treasures than that of Egypt so he was a
[1:28:43] prisoner of Christ just like Paul was
[1:28:45] remember all three of them were
[1:28:48] pets yeah see and they had to be sick of
[1:28:53] their own thinking and order to become a
[1:28:55] prisoner to the will and the ways of God

[1:30:49] be a l slave to Christ they have to be
[1:30:52] shaved off and
[1:30:54] presented sometimes he take them to the
[1:30:56] desert to do that to shave them off and
[1:31:00] then bring them out the anointed one to
[1:31:03] fulfill the purpose that he's ordained
[1:31:05] them to be Hallelujah see what I mean
[1:31:08] Brothers we're at the end time remember
[1:31:12] all other times what he's done he's
[1:31:15] always had to take a man and make him a
[1:31:17] prisoner to him forsake his
[1:31:19] own he had to forsake everything that he
[1:31:22] know forget all the trainings and
[1:31:24] everything in order to know the will of
[1:31:27] God and to follow God he can't follow
[1:31:29] anything that man's got to do and God
[1:31:31] the same time it's too contrary one to
[1:31:33] another you can't be going east and west
[1:31:35] at the same time you can't be going uh
[1:31:37] right and left at the same time you
[1:31:38] can't be doing right and wrong at the
[1:31:40] same time you can't be following man and
[1:31:41] God at the same time no sir you either
[1:31:44] following God or following
[1:31:46] man now then if you are following God
[1:31:49] and have submitted yourself to God then
[1:31:53] you become a prisoner to that God to
[1:31:56] that word to that will no matter what
[1:31:58] anything else is you become a prisoner
[1:32:00] to it listen we're at the end
[1:32:05] time and I would say this with reverence
[1:32:08] and respect as a last couple minutes is
[1:32:11] floating by
[1:32:13] look what God in my opinion will do and
[1:32:18] must do and will do in this last day is
[1:32:22] to find the tool for the heart
[1:32:26] you's got to find the tool to trace the
[1:32:30] for any farmer when he goes to his
[1:32:33] Harvest he has to have a tool to do it
[1:32:36] with you got to have a sharp sickle or
[1:32:39] something some instrument to thrash out
[1:32:41] the Grain and the Harvest is
[1:32:45] right God take it in your
[1:32:48] hand make a bond Serv of your love and
[1:32:52] use the for to to bring the realization
[1:32:56] to this sinful cursed Earth that we're
[1:32:58] living in today that Jesus Christ is the
[1:33:00] same yesterday today and forever for
[1:33:03] myself God let me be a
[1:33:05] prisoner if all my brethen turn me down
[1:33:08] if all my friends turn me down I want to
[1:33:10] be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and his
[1:33:13] word that I might be harnessed to his
[1:33:15] word by the Holy Spirit to see the Holy
[1:33:19] Spirit make the word of God be confirmed
[1:33:22] by the same things that he said would be
[1:33:23] done
[1:33:24] I want to be a prisent of Jesus Christ
[1:33:27] let us
[1:33:30] pray I wonder tonight with our heads
[1:33:33] bound if that
[1:33:36] ambition that we have of being something
[1:33:39] else or maybe a something that we might
[1:33:43] think be a selfish thing wonder if we
[1:33:45] couldn't just kind of laid that aside
[1:33:47] yeah I wonder if some young boy here
[1:33:51] tonight look around and say I'm going to
[1:33:53] be
[1:33:55] when I get big I'm going to be a certain
[1:33:56] certain thing I wonder if you can feel

[1:43:00] vision and said that he was going to sit
[1:43:03] on the throne and his brothers was going
[1:43:06] to bow to him because he knew that his
[1:43:10] gift come from God and he knew that it

[1:43:17] keep that in our mind according to the
[1:43:21] word of God
