Description:
Our Identification
Br. Raphael Kabeya
Christian Life Tabernacle
July 9th,, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] Amen. And also, we just want to remember the many needs that have been made uh known before the church. And also, our pastor, Brother David and Sister Lesley, are traveling back.

Lord, there's expressions of woe, discomfort, homesickness, [Music] confusion, but Lord, we lay all these things down. Put them aside, Lord. even the direest of needs. For there's one need, Lord, that remains greater than any other is to draw closer to you. To have you reveal more of your word to us, Lord. For Paul taught us when you've done all you can do to stand. Stand therefore. So Lord, tonight we stand on your word by faith believing Lord that you're in our midst that you hear our prayer and Lord, your desire is to give us what we have need of. Hallelujah. So Lord, we just want to draw closer to you for having been in the service. And when your word comes forth, Lord, may we agree with it, we say amen to it, and we'll receive the promise that all of the problems can be solved, Lord. We just ask Lord as we sing these songs and lift up praise to you Lord. Lord that you can just hover over us, walk the aisles, touch those that are sick and body, that have needs, Lord, maybe tired. Lord, just comfort us. I pray just by being together. Lord, there's something about fellowship and coming together, assembling ourselves in the house of the Lord that's a benefit to us. Lord, we just lean on you. Use the tithes and offerings for your honor and your glory. Use us as you'd see fit. We ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. And you may have your seats. Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk for the hand of God in all my life. I see. Oh, and the reason of life is just the secret of this at the top of my way.

So, yeah, I know you might got the world kind of still all over you and just man, it's been hard to go to work and and and the cares of life, but I tell you what, we are going in a rapture. I tell you what, you I maybe you're going through a really rough trial and I tell you, you ought to just give God all you got right now. Say, Devil, you ain't going to hold me down. I'm going in a rapture and I'm excited about it. I might not feel excited, but guess what? I'm going to let the devil know who side I'm on. I'm going to let him know where I'm going. So, I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of excitement, but there's only one thing to get excited about, and that's what we got. So, let's get excited about it in your own way. I ain't I don't want everybody be me, but you be you. Let's sing it like we mean it. You know, I I don't know.

God, our heavenly father, Thank you for the privilege you've given us tonight. I commit your servant brother David who is absent and his wife. I thank you for the confidence that is given me to stand here at this place. Uh with all my heart I commit all the ones that work with them, all the men of God, musicians, all the officials and all the church, everybody that supports this ministry. Now I ask you give me your grace that something may be said that would help every children of God that's in need to live close to you in the true uh uh communion father in your word. We realize it's later than we think. Let us run with the right the correct message. Be conscious of what we are doing. Realizing that you're in our midst, we ask for your grace. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Happy to see you uh on this other side of eternity. Privilege for me and my wife to be among you again tonight. And I thank our brother David who asked me to take his place uh here tonight. May God give me grace so it could be a blessing to all the children of God to the light of the uh modern event we realize there's no more time we in in the general manner life is is not holding forth anymore believe that one way or the other in in a twinkling of an eye will leave the surf to another place. We don't we don't we don't we don't need to live here anymore. Because in reality nothing is holding anymore. I I feel the Lord is at the door. Our objective is for everybody to now turn towards him because there's nothing else outside of him that we can count on in this world. So I'd like to speak on a a very little subject tonight. Our identification. [Music] Uh let's take our Bibles in Romans chapter 6 from the first verse. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we that are dead in sin live any longer therein? Know ye not that? Know ye not that so many of us were baptized in Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by the baptism into death. That like Christ was baptized was baptized up from the dead by glory uh by the glory of by the glory of the father. Even so, we are we should walk in the newness of life. Our gracious father, come and help us now, bless my brothers translating me that we may be on the same channel that everything may be clear for your children in once again thank you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I bring you all the greetings of our from our church in Brazville. I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Like I I I announce I'm going to speak on a little subject, our identification. Amen. We have to identify with something. You know that when Jesus was here on earth, [Music] he dressed like every man would dress. He had a long hair and he wore uh he had a beard like anybody else. He was not trying to distinguish himself from others or try to be different from others, but it was his life that was speaking of his identity. His life was speaking of who was he was truly And I believe that's what God wants us Christians to be. He wants that our lives be our identity. So as my sun is setting and my days are shortening, I'm very conscious of that. The most important thing for me at this moment, the thing to which I aspire the most is to be like Christ. to be like Christ to follow him to identify myself with him. That's the thing. Okay. It's the desire of each one of us to be identified with Christ. And I believe to be in the to be made in in the image of Christ makes you makes you identified with Christ. [Music] It's not what we show on the outside. It's what what's happening inside that shows who we really are in uh images of Christ. The prophet will say paragraph paragraph 33. So if he's our image and we are at his we are in his image. and members of his body. [Music] We have to be like him. Each one of us, we have to be like him. We have to look at ourselves and ask, are we trying to be like him in our everyday life? Our lives should reflect the life of Christ, not to joining to a church or to where uh to to to put a crucifix or in our emotions in in in shouting or in in in emotions and screaming. [Music] But that had to be the life of Christ. Uh that's that the life of Christ living God that's reflected through our lives and and sometimes it's with very little noise. Just like the the sun works, you don't hear any agitation from the sun. I believe in emotions but the emotions doesn't transform you. We want a resurrected Christ who's living among us. making himself known and confirming himself yesterday, today, and forever without you saying a word. Just looking at you and coming in contact with you, we notice that you are someone different. That's what the church has need of. That's what members of the church have need of so they can uh uh uh focus the the the the gifts and everything to have the true Christ in us not just emotions but Christ living in us it it helps focus our emotions and our gifts. And like his servants and his servants, we have received the commission to carry out exactly as he's been uh uh uh ordained or shown in the message of the hour that uh uh men uh uh uh men and women daughters of God may be identified to to Christ and live in in in unity. The prophet said in why the little Bethlehem paragraph 127 uh and 128 I don't worship a Jew. I worship God when I worship Jesus Christ. Because Jesus Christ is the only and true God. I don't worship a fiction or something in the history. I worship Jesus Christ, the presence of Jesus Christ right now, [Music] which is the word that's manifested in this age. This message, this message of the end time, it's nothing but Jesus Christ himself because he's the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. And tonight, the same spoken word that created the world. Then we have something real. God has allotted to each generation a portion of his word from the beginning and in which of those ages passed by. God sends an anointed prophet for that age and for this age. We know the anointed prophet many wanted to take his place. Many they they they replaced him but the prophet remains the same and the message remains the same. [Music] All that make noise will pass away, but the word remains the same. In the time of Noah, in the days of the rest of them, when he made the promises, I don't care what kind of condition the church got into, he always does that. He sends a man anointed and I believe you have anointed men among you that would only bring you this message as the time is coming to an end. And if we can all try to identify with Christ, the time of manifestation is already here where sons and daughters of God have to be manifested. In fact, the word of God comes to the prophet and here he stood there each prophet and was condemned by organization of that day. He stood on the word and made the word live. The message that we have received If we give it the first place when we take it, it's a living word. And every new person who comes in contact with this message, they feel it's something different. And when there's a good atmosphere where people realize that Christ himself is here in our midst, [Music] the sick will be healed just by listening to the to the word. [Music] be people could be delivered just by listening to the word because there's everything in the word just the word not actions God wants the his church to be to feed upon the word of that that season of the season that's why Malachi 4 says that in divine services we hear more the words of men than the words of God. That's what we hear the most. We make a lot of noise. We make we do a lot of gestures. It was almost like we are in a the uh theater. But here we are in the presence of the living God. That's why this is called a sanctuary because the holy God is here. It's bringing us to be conscious of that and he can do a lot of good things in our midst. The prophet says in the divine services we hear more the words of men than we do the words of God. people they talk a lot the whichever manner they choose to and they make dissertation upon like they want to my my my my friends all that we have need of from the new birth until the glory is only in this message that is the spoken word Only a lived message will give people the thirst for them to come to Christ. We speaking about our identification. Let me insist on that. Only the message that's lived [Music] will give people the thirst for them to identify with it. to identify with Christ. The creator who humbled himself before his own creation. The creator, the creator, he's mixing himself with his creation. He's looking like his own creation. That's not what we see today. We see a great man. They look at you like this. What are we looking for? The great Jehovah, he made himself a simple like a a mortal being. We want that kind of identification. It's not about knowledge but life lived. bring forth the desire for identification will say in a message from that time paragraph 25 let's take few mens that that have met God and it's changed the destiny of their life and the life of the people in their generations Let's take for instance Abraham. Abraham, he was just an ordinary man. And when Jesus came, just like an ordinary man, it was uh uh looked down upon but it was a creator, an ordinary man. He was not a saint. He was just a man. [Music] Oh, I'm glad that we don't have to be born in a certain line or be somebody or be some great somebody. We just have to be humble. God's grace is what does the workmen I didn't I don't have anything good I cannot give anybody anything but the grace of God is what does everything Abraham was only a man uh perhaps in in in bushes one day in the valley in the senior sino and was going out to cities come out of the city of Earth, wandering about in the in the bush maybe with a ship or a ship and so forth. And God met him and God spoke to him and blessed him. God met him, spoke to him and blessed him. I believe that a man comes to God and has a a definite experience. Oh, maybe you think I'm beside myself, but look, [Music] I don't mean an impersonation of experience. We've got so much of that today till it till it makes a real Christian sick to look at it. [Music] Somebody trying to impersonate somebody else even to imitate the voice to impersonate the way of prayer to imitate the imitate how to jump and how to see all of that everywhere. But the prophet says [Music] God has never made two the same. He never did and never will. God is a God of variety. He makes big hills and little hills and deserts and swamps land and what whatever more. He's a god of variety. [Music] Don't try to impersonate anybody anyone else. Be what you are, what God made you, and then you will be a blessing. Uh uh uh impersonation doesn't even help yourself. The prophet says, [Music] "God has difficulties finding somebody with him he could work with. I mean question and answer of uh uh uh June 28, 1959. Listen, God has difficulties finding somebody with him. He could work, somebody who will remain humble and and and and and quiet. Do soft and meek and stay in place until God calls him to do something. You believe that? See, somebody that God can bless and still still keeps himself a man. Listen to that. Someone that God can bless and and he still can keep himself a man, not be an angel or a God who's not going to try to uh uh uh uh uh build himself up. Oh, I'm this. I did this. have done that. A man that God can anoint and signs and wonders are following, but he remains a man. Simple, simple, humble, humble, it's something that's rare. As soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him, he wants to become a god. He wants to become an angel. He wants to become some great person. I want what I do and me and mine and all that. the the the uh uh saints of God, they don't take that because they have something in them that cannot stand those kind of things. They know their God, the almighty, the omnipotent who came as a simple man. And when a man stands before you and he he he he tries to pass himself as God. I don't know how you can follow that. That's a wrong attitude. God is hunting for somebody he could blessed and pour out the blessings. And the more he's blessed, the little the man will become. God hidden and revealing simplicity. My my my dear friends, I want just to show you the identification and I and I I I know you're seeing it. I don't I don't need to make a lot of comments. So the word as is spoken is is helping you somewhere. [Music] He's helping you to identify to that one other person who had everything but living like he didn't have any. Uh Revelation chapter 4 uh first part paragraph 17. And many times people understand wrong. And when they say you are you are you don't go you don't go to places like you used to go that other ministers go to and they have all have a it's people talking to the prophet not a messenger they say this I learned something in taking a lesson from the Bible and from our Lord [Music] that Jesus was not a man with spectacles. That was not in him. He didn't he he wasn't looking for spectacles. You see, he was not a man with spectacles. And I don't believe his disciples are the same way. Are we his disciples? The prophet says, "I don't think his disciples are going to be people that are looking for things sort of great spectacle." They never showed themselves as being people looking for spectacles because they have to identify to the master and that master is here. I'm telling you the truth is here because he's the word. I think that's where we've missed the thing today. Maybe it's my personal opinion. It's when we're trying to demonstrate a big something, you know, I think that looks more like a spectacles than it would to something that's holy. Here we are serving a holy God, a sacred God. We have to realize that he's here. And I have a lot of testimonies that of people that came to the church They they observing the the the just the the calmness, the the serenity and and the word listening to the word and at the end. These people that came for the first time, [Music] they were completely delivered from their sicknesses and the grave sicknesses. They uh uh give testimonies later on that the atmosphere that I found in the church, I felt I was in heaven. We can bring heaven down on earth if we realize that God is here and heaven is here. You know my friends, if President Trump is sitting here, you will have a certain behavior because the head of state is here. Is that true? True. There's certain uh behavior, there's a certain attitude that you cannot uh uh show forth when the head of state is sitting there because he's an honorable man, respected. But here we have the Lord of Lord. Sometimes we do gestures that makes us look like we are in the theater. God is sacred. I I continue to read. If you noticed at the coming of the Lord, those that had received him, it was Simeon that nobody had heard talked about. But but he who was waiting for the for the coming of the Lord, the the the the the widow woman Anna in the temple. Uh John the Baptist in the wilderness. John went in the wilderness at 9 years old. Never appeared again till he was uh 30 in the wilderness. and men like that who uh uh secretly believed and kept humble. They was looking for the coming of the Lord and they never uh uh did blow uh their meeting up and have to put on the great signs. Oh, make put great signs. the hour, the time and and the telecast and everything. That's all right for those who wants to do it that way. But for but me that doesn't seem Christlike. Do you believe the prophet? As for me, it doesn't look Christlike. perspective in the message uh expectation the prophet says now we don't want to say a true and and real uh revival [Music] is not announced in the great titles and in in newspapers and those kind of things. No, no, no, no. There was one thing that lack in the life of Jesus Christ. I don't like to say that, but it was that there was missing something to in the life of Jesus Christ. uh a sense uh of uh uh um trying to uh um help him or what? Uh huh. No. Uh like blow things up to show forth something. He was not a spectacle man. Today [Music] everybody have wants they have a big title in the in in the newspaper so they can uh talk about what they are doing. It's pretentious those things. It's not a true servant of Christ. A true servant of Christ is humble. He's he holds himself back. You believe the prophet, he holds himself back. When a revival starts, look what always happens. When that happens in the time of in the day of Jesus, there was just a minority, just a few people. Look what John had out there on the bench. just few people gathered around from the region around to hear him. About uh uh 99% of them rejected his message and walked away. Yet it was a great revival and time. Yeah. Thank you. a shaking time. God shakes things. And I believe that tonight it could be a little shaking. God shakes things. He shakes things and people don't realize uh it's it's being done. You see, God shakes his church. The the revival is to his church. [Music] The church that's in the church. You you following me? Amen. [Music] It's for the church, the revival. And the church is what's being shaken, not everybody. I believe the church is called out now. But the thing to do to revive to revive is to revive and shake that church to its place again. and its place. It's to identify itself with Christ, not to follow the world like we see. Today, the church is seduced by the world. They do things like the world does it with a lot of noise. They worship the living God like the world adors him. They do things so they can be seen of men and not of God. You you remember this young man who was playing music in front of people. [Music] The whole the whole crowd was shouting and and and clapping for him. But that didn't mean anything to him. His eyes were focused on the balcony where his master was sitting because he had to raid him. Your your shouting, your acclamation, and all of this didn't mean anything to him. He was looking for a word from the master. He wanted the master to shake his head. That's why we live today. When we stand in front of people, we want their approval, their acclamation. So we can say we preach. But is the master also saying that we are at the end. Jesus is coming to look for a word bride. people that are identified to himself. The world does a lot of things that attract our attentions, but the bride doesn't look at it. It looks like a a message church and the things that they do all their traala just so people can clap. Christ Christ is not in those things. Christ is in the word. I I I think my friends, we need a true shaking so we can get the church out of the worldliness and the the uh behaviors or habits that makes people popular. The message didn't come to make preachers popular. No. No. God placed us. So we can attract people to Christ, to him, not us. We are passengers. Amen. It's a time of shaking. A time to come out of distraction. The images of Christ. Paragraph 71. Now remember this. [Music] It's only the people that are sick. They're the ones that need the attention and service and service. They looking for attention and service. It's the the It's the sick that demands attention service. When you see a preacher, may I not limit it to a preacher, but may I limit it to every church member that wants attention? Who says from somebody, me, just remember There is there is a person a a spiritual sick person. They are needing attention. They need the attention of the spirit of God to give them something that will take that attitude out of them. and heal them from their selfishness and big ideas and big me and little you. The Holy Ghost makes us all the same. He makes us all the same. I like to see at the end of the church service, oh my dear brother, you see people that are looking at each other like that and they looking for who to shake hands. That's not the church of God. We are all the same. The Holy Ghost makes us all the same. Too much spiritual sickness anemic. You know what anemia is? If somebody is somebody hasn't got enough blood, any blood, they walk funny. They are topsy tipsy topsy all the time. That's what's the matter with many of our church members today. They are anemic. They need a blood transfusion of Calvary. I give them rich royal blood. to make them walk in the old-fashioned Holy Ghost hued out way heed out way of God. That'll give them something to live for. Give them a confidence that'll make them walk in the image of their Lord. for my for my side as for myself for for my side. Brother said, "If I had a choice to make, I want to be like he was. He came to be a shepherd and he was a shepherd. A shepherd is one who goes after his sheep. My dear friends, without insisting so much on the word identification, I believe that in a a very simple way but very clear way. I showed you our identification and we are happy to be uh communing together tonight here. and to know that our identification is up on high and Christ is our model. If there's somebody that you follow after, follow after Christ. Don't follow after man. And our life constitute our identification. That's our identification. If I don't do the works of my father, then don't believe me. Here are the signs that follows them that believe. Do you believe that? That's our identification. I give you power to walk on on on serpent on the scorpions and all the power of the enemy and nothing will harm you. Do you believe that he gave you that power? That's right. He knew that will will walk in the midst of serpents in the midst of but he he assured us nothing will harm you. Let's hold there. Don't let's not complain. Oh, this scorpion's home. Where am I going to walk? He he he let us know in advance that we have the power to walk on those things. They can bite us, but they're not going to do anything. The B is not going to do anything to you. The Lord said, "I give you power and nothing will harm you." Friends, Christian friends I believe we only have one book here and that's the Bible. We only have one creed and that's Christ. Not this or that that over there. We only know Christ. We only have we have no love but love. And God loves all men. He's calling upon all to believe upon his son King who gave his life for all of them. He took our place. [Music] He took our sins and our iniquity. He He accepted it just to believe that and they have you will have life. Don't fight. You are not good. You will never be good. That said the prophet, but he took your place and God looks at him and not you. He took your place and everybody is welcome here. Regardless of your belief, you are welcome here. They don't ask you anything. Just believe what he did for you. Everything that you were, he forgot about it. [Music] Come and follow me. That's what he's asking. Then here we are forming the great economy of God without distinction of race or social class. God receives you as you are. receive his word and he's going to identify you to himself. Let's bow our heads. Tender heavenly father, these few words that are put together, you can fix them all together that each one of us that it may aspire to be like you. There's nothing in this world that could be compared to your love. You loved us no matter regardless of what we were even regardless of our rebellion. You loved us. You transformed us by your word. We want now live like your slaves that our lives not what we are talking about but our lives be our identification. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Bless my brother. Bless my sister. Bless our pastor. Give him more strength and and fulfill. Give him bless all that work with him. those that work in unity, may our glory come back to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus Christ. If they are sick, if there are those that that believe this is the truth, oh great Jehovah, you Jehovah Rafa, you Jehovah Gyra, may you extend your hand. May you upon all that they may have a testimony, a testimony for your hallelujah. Bless them all, Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. If the musicians could come. My what a word. Aren't you thankful for the word? Amen. Why don't we all just go ahead and stand? Amen. as the musicians come. I just I love the word of God and how he he he shows there in the very beginning that God never made two the same, that it's not about trying to be something that you're not and impersonating. And then and then the word comes right behind it and says we're all the same. And what's so amazing about that is when you're you you somebody might think, wait, that contradicts itself. No, cuz he was talking about a blood transfusion. And my that's that's when it takes it takes away your efforts and your ability to try to be like this brother and try to be like that guy and oh oh that one screamed and that one shout well then maybe that's that's what that's what I got to be doing or or maybe this one does that and maybe that's and you're always trying to manufacture something that somebody else is doing. when when you come and you're born again. I I had that I you know what I just maybe they could just start playing um something softly because I I on my heart I just I didn't want to let this pass um the opportunity of how the word come forth in such a way um to to minister to somebody's heart, you know, that it's not something that you're going to muster up. It's not something that you're going to achieve by your efforts and in trying to manufacture and impersonate this individual or that individual. But really what it takes is a it takes a blood transfusion where you are identified with the sacrifice. And that's where that sacrifice that was laid down on Calvary, Jesus paid the price that the life that was in the blood could come back upon the believer. And that would be the trans blood transfusion that makes us all the same. And and that that oneness or that sameness I isn't isn't we're all robots, but it's every person fitly joined to the body of God. That big beautiful bouquet of God where one one manifest the attributes in God this way and one manufactures it and one manifest it is the word I'm looking for in this way. And I was thinking about it and I thought, you know what that is? That's a surrender. Not a manufacturing, but a surrender. And I just thought maybe as we had the opportunity and the as the word went forth so beautifully and and hey, some of it a a correction and a a rebuke and but you know, the word those I love, I I I chasen, I rebuke. Isn't that good that Lord, it's not something that I'm manufacturing. It's not something that I'm working up and and putting together and trying to be like this or that. But Lord, it it's in humility and and reverence and your presence that I'm I'm surrendering and saying, "Lord, I want to be more like you. Lord, make me more like you, Lord Jesus." Not something that I can do, but I just thought I'd give the opportunity to to anybody that's here that you'd just say, "Lord, I I I want to maybe with every head bowed that Lord, I want to I want to humble myself to the word of God." Lord, I want to be more reverent and more sincere. And Lord, I seen such a great example in the prophet who was so humble and didn't make a spectacle and didn't lift himself up, but always pointed to Christ and had the ability to to humble himself and make himself a servant to man. Is that your heart's desire? You just want to be able to humble yourself to the Lord and be more like Jesus Christ. And as this word went forth, our identification is the word. Not something that we can do, not something that we can work up, but it's a by a blood transfusion. And I want to give somebody the opportunity here. Maybe you haven't had that blood transfusion and you haven't come into that identification of the sacrifice. Is there somebody that would want to lift their hand and say, "I I want to be born again." God bless you. God bless you. There's hands by many, many hands raised. God bless you. As our brother said, it's as the word that it was going forth. Why don't we just pray before him? Heavenly Father, Lord, your word has gone forth. And we thank you for your word. And Lord, we want to be identified with you and your word in this end time, Lord. not not in identified in man or identified in something that we can do that would bring attention to ourselves, Lord, but we want to be we want our identification to be in your word with that reverence and that humility and that meekness, Lord, and that gentleness of your spirit, Lord, that when people look at our lives, Lord, they would that it would cause them to hunger and thirst for something that we have, not in some big show, but Lord, just in the the fruits of Christ and the humility and the meekness, Lord, of your spirit. Lord, there are many hands raised here, Lord, that would want that blood transfusion and they want that life and they want that identification of the word. Lord, I pray that you would just meet them in their place right now as they would make a surrender to you and invite you into their heart. Lord, we so thank you for Calvary and the shedding of your blood, Lord. That we could have a blood transfusion, Lord, that would change our nature and make us a new creature in Jesus Christ. That we could be born again, Lord, and all made the same in the blood of Jesus Christ. What a wonderful opportunity you've given to us in this time that we're now living. Lord, we love you, Lord. We just thank you for this opportunity. We commit those that have raised their hands to you. Pray that you bless their hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by. You will find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. He is passed by his holy name. Your needs to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord. As he goes by, reach out. Touch the Lord. [Music] You will find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. He is passing by this moment. Your needs do.

As brother David comes to close, oh, you are worthy of it all. Hallelujah. Oh, you are worthy of all. For you are all things, to you are all things. You deserve glory. [Music] Heavenly Father, we're very conscious of you here, Lord, and that you've drawn nigh. And I believe you're breathing out over your children, Father. Lord, and it's in this atmosphere that lives are changed. And Lord, your word is quickened and made a reality. Father, I want to thank you for that. Thank you for being mindful of your children. Lord, you're worthy. Yes, Lord. You deserve the first place, the preeminence. Truly, all our hearts desire is to reflect you and the love that you've shown us. Lord, that when we look outward towards the needs of others, then Yes. then things can change. Yes. Lord, your prophet taught us Christianity in such simplicity. [Music] Lord, our heart's condition should be to live for others. Lord, even now in this moment, those hands that were raised to know you. [Music] It's the greatest privilege I've ever known, oh God, is to know you. Thank you, Jesus, Lord. I want a birthing floor, oh God. I want a place where people come to know you when they come into this house, oh God, to know the reality of you, oh God. And Lord, I don't want to hold anything back that would prevent that from happening, Lord. Yes, Lord. I don't want to be too proud, Lord. And oh God, as a church, I believe every single one of us wants to see whoever raised their hand come to know you, Lord. Yes, Lord Jesus. Lord, your word has come forth. Lord, it's been the truth. It's absolutely nothing but the truth. Lord, where your word is, your Holy Spirit's there to brood out over it and to bring it to pass. And Lord, in all this, we just could stand back and say you're worthy of it all, Father. Lord, it's nothing man can do, but you're the giver of life. You're the quickener. You're the keeper of the covenant, Father. You gave the promise. You drew the heart. You You caused him to raise the hand, Father. and you're here to confirm yourself to be the same yesterday, today, and forever. So, we commit it to you, Lord Jesus, as we'd go our separate ways, the many that would be traveling. And Lord, our pastor as he's traveling back still, Father, be with him. And Lord, you know the needs that are represented, Lord, we just commit it all to you. In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. and mercy ruled my life. Amen. You are dismissed. Oh, it was mercy re [Music] and I should have fallen in my soul cast of mercy. He ruled my life. [Music] Oh mercy, oh my God.
