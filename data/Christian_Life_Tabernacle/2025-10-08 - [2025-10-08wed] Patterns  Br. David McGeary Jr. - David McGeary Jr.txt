Yeah, this song is was kind of unplanned. Sing just a closer walk if the team in the back can help me with it. Uh just derives out of a little testimony today. Witness our work. We had a we have a young lady that just got hired long ago after me that's uh been working in the office and today she ate something. It's either spiked her sugar pressure or dropped it low. I don't know the difference between them but um after eating that thing she just collapsed at work and the ambulance took almost 25 minutes to come you know. Um, we had we have people that has experienced at work kind of just like trying to maneuver their way around her. And as I was sitting there, I was just like, "Can I pray for her? Can I pray for her?" And um, you know, HR out there in corporate office like, "Hey, stay away." So I was like, "No, we just say a word of prayer for her." And I approached, I just got as close as I could. uh prayed for her and then kind of stood back because you know the big bosses everybody they're in panic and then a while after they got a hold of her mom on the phone and you know I just knew from that moment things will be fine and the mother was like trying to speak to her you know Tyler can you come back can you hear me you know just like can you guys lay on the side you know just right there at that moment I just noticed you know things started to change and before the ambulance came, she actually was able to start breathing back again. And you know, to me it was a testimony because I was trying to get to her, but then through that, you know, it could have been death. You know, her mom was like, "Oh yeah, if the ambulance is taking long, it's going to cost her life." And even though it took almost 25 to 22 minutes for the ambulance to come, know the angel of the Lord touched her. Amen. So just when I sing a song just a closer walk. It was a very good reminder that to me you can live any day. Just have a closer walk. If you can help me with it. [Music] Just a closer walk with thee. Friend to Jesus is my plea today. Walking close to thee. [Music] Let it be my Lord. Let it be. I am weak but thou are strong. Jesus keep me from all. I'll be sisfied as long as I walk. Let me walk close to thee. [Music] Just a closer walk with thee. Granted, Jesus is my plea. Daily walking close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be. through this world of toll and snare. [Music] If I faltered, Lord, who cares? [Music] If me, my birth share, none by thee, my Lord, none by thee. Just a closer walk with thee. Granted, Jesus is my plea. Daily walking close to thee. [Music] Let it be, my Lord. Let it be. [Music] When my feeble life is time for me will be no more. Guide me gently, safely over to thy kingom shore. to the shore. Just a closer walk with the [Music] granny Jesus is my plea. Daily walking close to thee. Let it be, my Lord. Let it be. [Applause] Amen. It's a privilege to walk with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful that we can say we've been granted that same privilege to walk with him every day and his desires to be one with us. Amen. Have a couple announcements here. Brother Tim Sil writes, "If your family is planning on attending the Sunday school fall fellowship on the 18th, uh please sign up on the sheet provided in the library." So remember this is for all uh both Sunday school age and non-s Sunday school age. So it's all together. Um um it says in the library so we can get a head count for food. Also we are asking that families uh bring uh drinks to contribute. Amen. Sister Lori has a request and please keep my husband Daniel in prayer. He will be having a a back surgery on Tuesday. We certainly just want to uh remember him in prayer that the surgery will go well. Amen. That he may come out uh well. Amen. Also um uh there was a request put in. I believe this from brother Thiago. It was sent out that said u uh there was a brother in Brazil whose little boy um u had a pan of oil fell upon him and he was burned entire body. He's only four years old. His name is Lucas Kudo. Um the report is that uh he's in a stable condition waiting for result for surgery. Many of uh perhaps he'll have many more surgeries because uh his body is burned really bad in many areas back and and and his head and the blood is not circulating well in those areas. We're just going to continue to remember this little boy and lift him up that the Lord will certainly uh touch him and make him well. Amen. We certainly want to thank the Lord for sparing brother Ben from an accident he had and his year alive and we thank God for that. Amen. Amen. If you have a need upon your heart, I know we have many that are not. We want to remember them in prayer, but Matthew is out ministering. Remember him and his family. And if you have a need upon your heart, just reach out your hand to him. Oh my just I believe that we are made to just be dependent on him. Man, where could we go? It's him that has the breads of life and want to come tonight and take our needs to him and know that he will answer it. Amen. The brothers that are taking the offerings if you could come. And brother Jay, if you could just come and take this needs before the church. Amen. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we just want to Lord, lift each need, Lord, that was on paper, Lord, and each need that was represented by the uplifting of the hands, Lord. Lord, there's no better place that we can put these needs before except for before you, Lord. And we just So you'd come on this scene, Lord, right now in this moment, Lord, for Lord, the needs that are in emergency, Lord, that Lord, that man could do nothing for, Lord, but we know that you can, Lord, help the the little boy, Lord, that's been burned. And Father, we just place him in your hands. And Lord ask that you would Lord just provide them with comfort. Lord, Lord, provide them with, Lord, a surrounding of people, Lord, that would be praying for him, Lord, that would be just in faith, Lord, have faith to believe, Lord, that you can take care of all things, Lord. And for the brother having a back surgery, Lord, I just ask that, Lord, you'd guide the the hands of the doctors, Lord. And Lord, that you'd just have such an atmosphere around him, Lord, that Lord, he would just lift his hands up to you and just believe that you're there, Lord, and that you can help him through it, Lord. And and Brother Ben, Lord, we just thank you for watching over him, Lord, let them make it safely here, Lord, for keeping him safe. and Lord Thiago, Lord, the prayer requests he had.

And just ask that you'd have your perfect will and perfect way, Lord. I know there's ones, Lord, seeking for jobs, Lord, that have job interviews maybe coming up, Lord. just ask that your will would be done, Lord, in each situation. Father, provide for them, meet every need, Lord, for the tithes and offerings, Lord, just put in your hands, Lord.

[Music] I desire him salvation come. Oh, there's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. Let's all stand and sing it as if God junior. Oh, there's no God like Jehovah.

There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. Be holy comeing on the cloud. Shining like the sun. When your trumpets call on your voice. It's the year of truly not until salvation comes. Let's just go before the Lord. Gracious heavenly father, we're thankful to be gathered in a house of faith tonight, Lord, with a people who believe all things are possible. Lord, just to hear the request of Lucas, a young child, Lord, not even maybe with faith to believe for himself. Lord, we think Lord that situation would be dire, Father. And Lord, we know you're the God of the impossible. Lord, whether it be a small burn or a great burn, what's it to you, Father? Lord, it's doesn't matter what the obstacle is, you're greater. So, Father, we just bring that to you one more time and ask that you would be merciful and Father, that you'd be glorified. That you'd bring healing and Lord, you're the creator. You'd create skin and Father, you'd bring peace and be with the child. Father, Lord, tonight, Lord, we stand in need of you as well, Lord. We need you to come. And Father, there could be situations that just seem impossible spiritually. Lord, if we were to look, Lord, the needs of your people could be great. Lord, we would say there's no remedy. This is too much. The mind is too scarred. The spirit is too broken. There's no no hope. But with you, all things are possible. So, Father, we're looking to you now to come and break the words of life to us. May you just be the one who ministers life. Lord, we're believing for great things because we're your people and you love us and you desire good things for us. We pray and ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. If you could turn with me in your Bibles, we're going to read out of Romans chapter 5, starting at verse 12, it would read, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the simultude of Adam's transgression, who is in the figure of him that was to come. Adam being in the figure of him who is to come. But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For though, or through the offense of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that sins, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification. For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more then which received abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. Amen. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through the righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. We ask the Lord to add the blessing to his word. You can be seated. We'd like to fellowship with you on patterns. I the scripture that we just read lays out a pattern I I would say of the law the of law and sin and death and it's it's been a pattern that's been in effect from the beginning. Um there's ways that we could look at this that we would understand that uh you know patterns could be something that would you know if I was to ask how many people like patterns? No. Well I we're on the wrong subject tonight. No one here likes patterns. So, uh, patterns could be good things. &gt;&gt; And you you actually by by the time this is over with, I hope we'll get one hand raised that we like a pattern. There's a lot of way too much negativity in the building because the only thing everybody thought of when they thought of patterns is bad patterns. Ties have bad patterns. All right. So, but patterns can be good and bad things. I mean, in society, we recognize a lot of things have patterns. We would say people are maybe going to be patterned after their family. Um, you know, if you've if your parents didn't go to college, you probably won't go to college. uh there's a lot of things that we would maybe recognize can be uh socio or something like that patterns that are after society that society would say hey uh there's things that you can predict are going to occur because things tend to fall into patterns we have weather patterns um is it El Nino I think is like there's certain things that fall in patterns so I would say there's enough body of evidence to say that God is a god of order um that the solar system everything there's a pattern. He he would use uh pre- symbols, forerunners. He would show things that were to come. God is actually a god of patterns. So, who likes patterns? Praise the Lord. We can go home now. We've we went from not liking something, you know, to liking something. That's amazing. But yeah, patterns are something we should be aware of because they become very uh uh when you could see a pattern or you could see a principle, when you could see that God does something a certain way, then you can have confidence that this is the way God operates, &gt;&gt; okay? Because that's what we just want to fellowship with you on. So, we've laid that out there. We're we're talking about patterns in general. Now, there could be um patterns that are are not absolute. Some patterns may consistently reproduce and then all of a sudden you have an outlier. You have a a a curve breaker uh that something all of a sudden just defies the pattern and you're no longer able to make predictions by the pattern or that the models just break. You know, they because of the one thing that upset the pattern, the prediction models are off the charts now. You try to map where a hurricane goes and all of a sudden it's like and there's things uh that affect patterns. I think there's butterfly effects. There's quite a study. You could be fascinated by patterns. And no one was at the start. But 2 Thessalonians 3:9 says, "Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an end sample unto you to follow us." So an end sample there is a pattern. So you are a pattern. You are disciples read of all men. The things you do, someone will follow after and do after you. Every single one of you is actually living a pattern that someone in some way will emulate. &gt;&gt; It it just is a given. You you someone's going to do what you do. And please don't do what I do. Do as I say, not as I do. I think we went through that on our very first service was uh don't don't do like I do because you might end up with a boo boo. So we make mistakes and that is is a tragedy. There's others that will repeat our mistakes. Um so we should always be aware that there's a pattern that's going to occur that's going to repeat and there's consequences to patterns but there's also blessings and patterns and we want to just continue fellowshipping on those. Um, you know, it was even by the pattern of life and death that we would establish. It was disbelieving God's word that death entered in. So, when you disbelieve God's word, there's a pattern that there's death that follows. You're not going to defy the law of God that says if you transgress the word, there's death. There's separation. There's going to be a consequence for sin. If there's sin, the law requires death. That's the pattern. That was the pattern that was set in the beginning. That was the separation. It was because there was disbelief that they had to leave the garden of Eden. There was a consequence. That's the pattern. &gt;&gt; So you are going to die is the pattern. Sin demands death. That's the pattern. There's an established you were born and and you will die. That's the pattern. So there's there's some absolute uh if we would say there's some pretty uh illrefutable patterns that mankind has been subject to and it's because of sin. It's because as we read in our text it's sin entered in and so there's now death reigns. &gt;&gt; That's a pattern. And even in the book of Revelations, it would say that if you take away from the word of God or add to, there's a consequence. So there's always a consequence for transgressing God's word. As we read in our text, I the law has been given &gt;&gt; and I would all are guilty. &gt;&gt; There is none that has not transgressed the law. Right? &gt;&gt; If if you think you are able to carry yourself in your own righteousness, you're wrong. The law has declared you guilty. &gt;&gt; We've all showed up Wednesday night sleepy to church. &gt;&gt; We've all not been in it like our like someone's salvation deter was determined by our attitude towards the service. &gt;&gt; We all have not taken our diligence towards the things of God that we should. What? Iniquity is to know to do things and to not do them. &gt;&gt; So there's iniquity. &gt;&gt; And we're not asking for justice. I'm not being the prosecutor here declaring you all guilty, but I want you to understand that the pattern requires a penalty. John 1 chapter 28 says, "These things were done in Bethesda beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is whom I said after me, cometh the man who which is preferred before me. For he was before me, and I knew him not, but he should be made manifest to Israel. Therefore, I am come baptizing with water. And John bare record, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it aboved upon him. So, here's John fulfilling the commission. He has a revelation. I want you to understand, we are not immune from pattern. It would be John that later on would be questioning, is this the one? &gt;&gt; It it seems hard to believe that would be the case. Here's the one who saw the dove, &gt;&gt; the spirit descending, who declared out of his own lips, this is the one. And yet, you'll find over in Matthew 11:2 and 6 through six. Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said unto him, "Art thou he who should come or do we look for another?" My, what a pattern. Having re having received the truth, now he's looking at the very promise fulfilled and questioning &gt;&gt; whether it's the one. Can this be? And there's an antidote. Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go show John again those things which you do hear and see. The blind receive their sight. The lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear. The dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he who shall not be offended in me." &gt;&gt; There's one way to remove spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; The the prescription has not changed. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said if if the works are not done, don't believe me. &gt;&gt; But the works are being done. &gt;&gt; Luke 7 18-23. And the disciples of John showed him all these things. And J John con called unto the two of his disciples and sent them to Jesus, saying, "Art thou he who should come, or do we look for another?" When the men were coming unto him, they said, "John Baptist has sent us unto thee." Imagine Jesus hearing this, saying, "Art thou he? Art thou he that should come? Or look we for another." And it ca and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight. Then Jesus said unto them, "Go your way and tell John what things ye have seen and heard. How that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised. To the poor the gospel is preached, and blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me." So we have Matthew, we have Luke giving the same account of a prescription for removing spiritual amnesia &gt;&gt; and it's it's a cure. But one thing we have to recognize that if it could happen to a prophet &gt;&gt; and there's other examples through the scripture and we don't want to just stick to this pattern but we have to recognize that there is a pattern where we need to be strengthened in the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have to be 100% assured from whence comes our help. &gt;&gt; And we need to know that we need to be in expectation of a supernatural deliverance. We're not we're not wanting a better psychology. We're not wanting to just be re encouraged in our minds, but we want Jesus Christ to show up on the scene and to prove himself the same yesterday, today, and forever. Doubting Thomas didn't say, "I'm going to need a better psychology than this." And God didn't meet him with a better psychology, but he allowed him to touch his side. We want the doubt removed. So there's a there's a deception that many could be taken by and there has to be a pattern of even a falling away. If you look at 2 Thessalonians 2 and3 says, "Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that the man of sin be revealed, the son of predition." So, we're going to just labor on this a little bit. In every age, there's a pattern of a falling away. &gt;&gt; There's those who receive the truth, rejoice in the truth for their day, but then do not go on to a perfection. they don't carry on the life and there's a re there's a cycle of revival and death but we have a pattern that's key to the believer and that is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so once you have the key that he doesn't change then when you even read the old testament and start to look at Israel and to start to see the things that pertain to Israel as a nation and recognize that they pertain to you as a believer that the same way he deals with the church, he deals with the individual. You start to recognize a pattern that should start to build our faith. There's principles of God that are involved here. &gt;&gt; He can't change. And brother Brandon would say this in the ex in the in the exposition of seven church ages. This is in the Ephesian church age. The key given to me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a is most scriptural one. In fact, it might be called the keystone of the Bible. I've already given it to you. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. It is the revelation that God never changes and that he his ways are unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Ecclesiastes 3:14-15. I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it, and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. That which he hath been now, and that which is to hath already been, and God requireth that which is past. Here it is. Here it is. An unchanging God with unchanging ways. What he did at the first, he will have to keep doing until it is done for the last time. &gt;&gt; There will never be a change. Apply that to the church ages. The kind of man that God chooses at the first age and now God manifesting that the men's ministry would be the example of other ages. So now you have a forerunner. What God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages. If you've studied the church ages, you know that every age came in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; There was never an age that wasn't marked by signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; We have a problem of looking back at how a denominated and finding that it's very irreconcilable that those things would be done by what we identify as the Methodist today. But you have to recognize what Methodists turned into was not the truth of their day. &gt;&gt; We'll just continue fellowshipping on that. Now we know exactly the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit. How the first or the original church was founded and how God manifested himself in her. The word can't change or be changed because the word of God John 1:1 in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. To change the word of it as did Eve bring sin and death. Even as it says in Revelations 22:18-19, if any man shall add any of these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that were written in the book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life. And out of the holy city, and from the things that were written in the book, thus which the church was at the Pentecost is the standard. This is the pattern. This is no, there is no other pattern. No matter what the scholars say, God has not changed that pattern. What God did at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing until the church ages close. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Those scholars would tell you the apostoistic age is over. Don't you believe it? Such a statement is wrong on two counts. First of all, it's wrong to suppose there aren't any more apostles. There's still those sent &gt;&gt; just because the original 12 are dead. An apostle means a sent one and there are many sent ones today but they are called missionaries. I'm thinking of a brother in the field right now. As long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life, there's an apostilistic age going on. Say hallelujah to that. There's a there's a there's a ministry that is going out that's performing the same Jesus Christ to the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; The gospel is still being preached to the poor. The blinded eyes are still being opened. There's signs and wonders following this gospel. Blessed are the feet of them. &gt;&gt; The gospel is going forth. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. I received a picture today of those being baptized in Pakistan. The gospel is being preached. &gt;&gt; There's those who are going out preaching the gospel. Those scholars may tell you the apostle is over. Don't you believe it? Such a statement is wrong on two counts. An apostle means one sent. There are many sent ones today, but they're called missionaries. As long as men are going, called sent forth the word of life, there is an apostilistic age going on. Secondly, they refer to the age of the manifest Holy Ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed. This is untrue. There is not even one scripture that suggests that, but many conclusively state otherwise. Here is our proof that both of these charges are false. Acts 238:39. Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Our pastor's been fellowshipping on the commission. &gt;&gt; This is that was our heart is to understand the pattern of the commission. And Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, unto all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. The promise of power that with which the apostles was endued at Pentecost is to you the Jews and to you the children Jews and to all that are a far off the Gentiles and to many as the Lord our God shall call both Jew and Gentile. Until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he's calling. &gt;&gt; Hey, BE THE VOICE OF THE CALL. And the signs won't cease. &gt;&gt; The power is in the commission. &gt;&gt; With boldness, proclaim this gospel. &gt;&gt; IT'S DARK. &gt;&gt; THE HOUR'S DARK. &gt;&gt; How great the light that you have the opportunity to shine. What the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right. Hallelujah. Originally, she had the pure WORD OF GOD. OH, I'M THANKFUL WE GOT the pure word of God. &gt;&gt; It's no longer covered up. Satan gained access to try to cover it up with intellectual thoughts. And there was a cycle of revival and death. But we have access to the pure word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you can have a confidence in the gospel we have. &gt;&gt; It's not cunning devices. It's not man's fables. It isn't no longer just a a a turning Christianity into a weak religion, but this is the power of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the power of the Holy Ghost. Hebrews 2:1 and4, wherefore we ought to give more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should make them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience to the word received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape transgression, reward? There's a scripturally there's a concept of reward. The pattern, you reap what you sow. There's a pattern. There's a pattern. What do you want to be found in the pattern of? Spoken of the word and was confirmed unto us to them that heard him. God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will. The original church was not organized by men. It was led by the Holy Ghost. Pattern can't change. It wasn't very big. Can't change. It was hated and despised, can't change. It was oppressed, can't change. It was p persecuted unto death, but it was true to God and it stayed with the original word pattern. &gt;&gt; The church, the elect, the bride, they won't hear another's voice. &gt;&gt; The sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow. &gt;&gt; The pattern is sure. It's an unchangeable word of God. The word of God cannot return void. &gt;&gt; And we possess the original word to be led of the spirit and to watch the signs and wonders follow &gt;&gt; the word. What's the pattern that we see all throughout the New Testament? Put the word of God before you. Let the word of God be a light into your path. The miracles follow just as they would put the ark before him. &gt;&gt; That is our pattern. &gt;&gt; Word first. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's that's the pattern. And we know that what happen is is this people get the pattern out of whack. They follow after signs and wonders without putting the word first. But just because there's those who do that doesn't mean we're in some mental quandry about the signs and wonders following the word. &gt;&gt; We're not scared by the st scarecrow. We understand that God is a God of of uh feeding the the the multitudes. Even those who are not going to receive the word, he breaks the loaves and the fishes. &gt;&gt; To those who are going to walk away when he says, "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no part of me." There's those who reject the word of God who are entitled to the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; How much more? &gt;&gt; How much more? I look at Ishmamail and if he could be uh the the Lord hear the cries of the lad as he sits under the bush, not even being the child of promise, but being an heir of Abraham that he could be preserved. How much more the children of promise? &gt;&gt; His ears open unto you when you cry. &gt;&gt; He knows your heart's desire. &gt;&gt; And you have to believe in his love and election for you. HOW MUCH HE DON'T SPURN his love. &gt;&gt; He's done everything to show you he cares and loves for you. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Hey, I just picturing the baby with the thing being swayed before its face and it doesn't respond. &gt;&gt; Let's not be blind down through every age. If we look at the church ages, and I'm we're not going to get in it, but I just want to look at Ephesians because in a lot of ways that was the closest to the original church before it started to regress, regress, regress, and and you had the the caterpillar, Palmer worm, cankerworm that the devil came against the church and and and put it in the ground. The church that the the Christians would be in the catacombs literally. Anybody know what a catacomb is? Praise the Lord. We got a couple. So, we'll tell you what a catacomb is. So, a catacomb was, I believe, a Roman institution where they would dig tunnels and they would put the bodies. They would stack up the bones. They would just they'd put them under the ground. That was a catacomb. There'd be long tunnels. So, think of a mining shaft. You know, these winding tunnels instead of a cemetery where you go in sections, you'd go down to the tunnel. You'd be like, "Take this turn, take that turn, take this turn. There's Johnny." That's a catacomb. &gt;&gt; Okay. Not a place you want to hang out. &gt;&gt; The church is in the catacombs meeting together to talk about the word of God, &gt;&gt; to fellowship about the things of God. They're literally in the ground. &gt;&gt; The darkest it would be. That's the pattern. A seed has to go into the ground. And that's what Christ was. He was a pattern. So just to establish this, I believe we've got time. Revelations 2:4. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love. To understand this you must realize that the first that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of Ephesus alone the messages to the entire age would lasted about 120 years. So there's I believe what he's saying is this there's a there's a group that really didn't its message then is the all the generations in that span you know there there's a there's a falling away in that generation I should say just the way he said it now history keeps repeating itself that's the pattern in the generations of Israel we see a revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation embers may be glowing slightly, but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of the original flame. Then God lights the fire again. The same process is repeated. It is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren. Salvation's not passed on by natural birth any more than there is any truth to an apostoic succession. And there's there's churches out there that that teach that. They're probably not even far from here. There's a many charismatic movements that believe in apostoistic secession. And there and they uh believe in the moving of the spirit and they believe in the authority of apostoistic secession. Like that's your So this is our our truth in our day cuts away those things. Salvation is not passed by natural birth or or any more than there is any truth to apostilistic succession. It isn't in the word. You start out with truly bornagain believers and when the next generation comes along, they are no longer just plain Christians, but they have taken a denominational name and now are Baptist, Methodist, etc., eteretca, &gt;&gt; etc. Has anybody filled in gaps, etc. I need to look up the definition. I'd probably get it wrong. I believe it means and so on and so on and so on and so on. All right. So, fill in the blanks. Um, I will say personally, um, and this is just my conviction and I'll share it with you. When I say the message, it means something precious to me. I don't look at it as the false. I don't look at as the fake. Um, there's brides, brides, churches, churches. We could say the church and we could mean the church nominal. We could say things and they have a different connotation. But when Brand Brother Brandham talked about the message, he said it wouldn't denominate. &gt;&gt; And and I when I talk about the message, I'm not talking about the denominational spirit that's never died. That's going to always attack the truth of every age. So that spirit workketh. But when I say the message, I don't I choose not to defame it to defame it with the connotation of denominationalism. &gt;&gt; It it has a little more sacred place than that. &gt;&gt; Just because the Catholics can claim the cross and they call it the crucifix, I haven't denigrated the cross as being an object of Catholicism. It's still precious to me. You You can try to take something that's holy and make it unholy, but you simply just can't do it. God raised this message up. &gt;&gt; Man can't put smud on it. &gt;&gt; But fill in the blank. Don't take a denominational spirit and put a label on yourself. &gt;&gt; You have to be born again. That is exactly what they are too. They are not Christians. You have to be born of the will of God, not of the will of man. &gt;&gt; I love that. Saints, &gt;&gt; just encourage your heart in the very experience that you've had. If you've ever had an experience of with God, it is not because you willed it. &gt;&gt; You didn't make yourself good enough. It is by the grace of God that he would have you experience his presence. What is man that thou are mindful of him or the son of man that thou would visit him? What is it that a holy God would come down and visit you? &gt;&gt; It's no small thing. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they are too. They are not Christians. You have to be born of the will of God, not of the will of man to be saved. But these folks are coming all together now by the will of man. I don't say that some of them aren't right with God. Not for a minute do I say that. But the original fire has died down. They are not the same anymore. Just reading on. The fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the cry for reaching out in the spirit. all begins to fade and instead that church being on fire with the fire of God, it is cooled off and become a bit formal. Church, this word starts to shave those things out of your life. &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message. &gt;&gt; It is by this word that we are made alive in Christ Jesus. This is the word of God that I'm reading to you by a prophet messenger coming and telling you what the enemy has done. The caterpillar, the palmer worm with the promise of I will restore, sayeth the Lord. And this message does it. It's these divine revealed truths that do it. It's this word that can't return void. I'm reading you a prophet's word because it will accomplish what it was sent for. I could I could tell you these things and and and and adlib them, but there's a confidence in the way they were brought, the way they were said, the way God brought them that it will accomplish what God sent it to accomplish. &gt;&gt; I I I hide behind it. &gt;&gt; My mind could get in get entwined of trying to express it. But this prophet was yielded to God in a way that it brought the undying word of Christ to you. and it's mocked. It's cooled off and become they're getting bit formally abnormal. The abonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them. That is a very true thing you could go study out. It's when men start to become concerned with the way they are perceived by others. They want to carry Christianity in a more dignified way. They want to present the do gospel in apologetics. I need to be able to present my doctrine to you in a way that just makes me feel good for believing it. &gt;&gt; It's almost like multi-level marketing. You know, I'm just I'm going to feel better about what I believe if I can convince you I can believe it or you can believe it and then we then we both believe it. And now I feel better because I thought a lot of you and now you believe it too. And it's just now let's both come up with an idea of how we could get others to believe this. Make it sound better. And they start to take the reproach the way God brought the gospel away from the gospel. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you church, you can never do away with the reproach of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Did Jesus Christ come in a manger &gt;&gt; pattern? Was there a reproach? How many people been to a barn? Okay. How many people would go walk around barefoot in a barn? I knew there were some people that did it. I I had some people in my head I knew would. If you're country, you're country. Okay. Your feet wash off probably easier than your boots. So, but that's my point, right? That's what culture does to you, right? I mean, the people who know a barn are okay with it. But those who put a reproach on it, they wouldn't do it. &gt;&gt; But that's the really the place where the issues of life are happening, right? But man, in our thinking, ooh, stinky. Well, you wouldn't be eating if not for a barn. &gt;&gt; I I even if you're a vegetarian, &gt;&gt; you probably wouldn't have got fertilizer on your crop if not for the barn. Sorry. So, respect the barn. But that's what brother Brandon would say is the culture, what culture is and what it does. So I I I don't want you to get away with that. Make sure you understand this is a pattern that Satan will attack you with. &gt;&gt; You know, he tells the story about the girl who was her. &gt;&gt; She went to college. She was very beautiful. She come back with her friends and her mother went to meet her &gt;&gt; and she was horribly disfigured. and because she was worried about what her friends thought, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, this plays out all the time. &gt;&gt; You You may even despise the Christian upbringing, the very thing that's protected you from the flames of this world. The very thing that has made sure you have a sound mind, the very thing that has preserved you and your parents have stood for and fought the fight, yet you will defame it. &gt;&gt; Because you're more concerned about what your friends think. &gt;&gt; So don't think this is just some allegory of some other age. This comes really home right down close and personal. Once the son of predition is exposed, it gives you power to overcome &gt;&gt; the he he he rode out down through all the ages. &gt;&gt; And he does it so. But pride defileth many. Such an evil thing. And you'll deny the very gospel o over it. The second generation coming on was just like Israel. They demanded a king to be like the other nations. When they did that, they rejected God, but they did it anyways. That is the history of the church. When it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God, it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things that they used to do and start doing the things they wouldn't do initially. They change their manner of dress, their attitudes, and their behavior. They get lax. That is what e ephesus means. Relaxing drifting. The cycle of revival and death has never failed. All you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church and prayed all night and took to the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit. They left their old dead churches and worship in homes or old store buildings. They had reality. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember telling my brother Aaron, you know, reality is an empty apartment and a 50 lb bag of rice. I don't know why I said that, but I think I was trying to say that, you know, you just get down to the rudimentary things, you can make it. You know, you just need to be willing to to do what you need to do. You could survive in this world. But the reality is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; The reality is in knowing him. The reality is that his blessings are here and they're overflowing. &gt;&gt; They had reality. But it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build fine new churches. They put in a choir. Instead of singing unto God for themselves, they put in gowns in the choir. They organized the movement. They ran it by man. You know that's we we have church cood and I'm not going to get into it. But it's the pastor. If you don't believe that you don't believe this message. They soon began to read their books. If you resent that, get converted. They let down the bars and the goats come in and took over. They cry. The cry of joy was gone. and it I can't get away from it. So, you lift up your pastor in prayer. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need to step back. He has to step up. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the joy of a of of of in his office. He could do many things at his discretion. But at the end of the day, he's the one who's answering. &gt;&gt; He can't say it was Ben. Ben did it. Billy did it. It's our pastor. &gt;&gt; He's given to lead the flock. &gt;&gt; He may delegate things, but that's still on him. &gt;&gt; And we act under the headship of our pastor. &gt;&gt; As a son, I've always been careful anytime I'm doing something in the I have access to him as my father, but there's times I go to him and say, you know, pastor, can I do this? Maybe I short circuit the process, but I go straight to the pastor and I get the PL pastor's blessing because there's authority in headship. &gt;&gt; That is a pattern. &gt;&gt; There's an order of blessing. You go look at birthright. You go look at everything and you do something outside of the headship, it's really hard to be blessed. And that's that is why you have to pray for your pastor because it's hard for something to be profitable and to be blessed if your pastor doesn't bless it. &gt;&gt; Really hard. That was not where I don't even know where I'm at anymore. &gt;&gt; You pray for me. But we we we want to get to this really quick. Um so we've establish a platform the cycle of revival and death would would say this age dies that we're going to end up cold and formal. We're going to end up in a church where the Holy Spirit doesn't move. where our young children come up believing a theology without having an experience. The cycle of revival and death would say that by the time the third generation gets here, the embers are cold. &gt;&gt; There's no blessing of the Holy Ghost to set him a fire. But I want to tell you this message told us that God isn't a grandfather. You know, Martin Luther brought justification, &gt;&gt; blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. And if you could just imagine the darkness they came out of to understand that assurance and the revival bells that were ringing just to rest in what faith was that I know it it's by his stripes he paid the price for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith. It is written the just shall live by faith &gt;&gt; and that was a a a light that shined in darkness. There is therefore no now no condemnation to them that that are in Christ. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. For it is by grace you are saved through faith, not of yourselves, but is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Yet in that blessed truth, you have a Lutheran church, I believe they have unspeakable things occurring in the name of that truth right there. That truth that sets free. That truth that rings in our hearts can be carried in such a way that it's dead. But I'll restore sayeth the Lord. Wesley understanding this truth also went on into holiness and sanctification, recognizing for it is the will of God even for your sanctification that ye shall abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor. We haven't done away with this truth, saints. Follow peace with all men in holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. This isn't something we can do away with. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it. We as Christians lay our rights down so that others can live even obedient unto death. That is our example. Christ, if we are to fight for this world, who can preserve our life? Who who do who should you fear? him him who could take this this life or him who could take this life and deliver the soul to hell. &gt;&gt; Fear God, &gt;&gt; you know, and just in the way of testimony, thinking of Lucas, they boiled John in oil before they put him on Patmas. &gt;&gt; They couldn't take his life. &gt;&gt; God hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; What's the key? What's the pattern? &gt;&gt; What are we preaching? Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You are not somehow now in an age where the devil could take your life. &gt;&gt; If God didn't permit it, &gt;&gt; boo devil. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to speed up a little bit, but it there's the cycle. going to skip over some things, but I want to talk about, if you will, in the in the way that patterns run, the outlier to the pattern, the breaker of the pattern, the cycle of life and death, and I think you know of some of these, but I think of Enoch. Enoch broke the pattern. And we look at Enoch and we see the very type of the age that we're in. &gt;&gt; These things were given to you as an example. To you &gt;&gt; this day, this hour, Enoch was given to you as an example. &gt;&gt; There may be those who are going to ride out the flood. They're going to go through the tribulation, but the bride does not go through the tribulation. Our messenger taught us he wouldn't do that to his bride. &gt;&gt; He's not going to purge his bride. She's cleansed now. &gt;&gt; You You have no ability to change your righteousness. He clothed you in his righteousness. HE PUT HIS NAME UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; He He erased the whole requirement. &gt;&gt; The person who made the pattern had the authority to say, "This is she. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PATTERN of going down and dying in death. &gt;&gt; Enoch testified of a better thing. &gt;&gt; He testified of a pre-tribulation rapture. &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PATTERN. &gt;&gt; STOP PATTERNING YOURSELF AFTER SOCIAL CHRISTIAN INFLUENCERS. THAT'S NOT MY PATTERN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY PATTERN IS GOD. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; NOT SOME SOCIAL INFLUENCER who tags himself as a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's not for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not going through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; You can lay your life down, BUT THAT'S NOT ME. I'M GOING UP. &gt;&gt; I recognize my day in the message. I recognize where I'm standing. I'm standing on a thus sayeth the Lord prophets message. &gt;&gt; I know the pattern. The word of God, he doesn't do nothing unless it reveals it to the servant, the prophets first. He speaks thus sayeth THE LORD. AND WHAT CAN STAND AGAINST IT? &gt;&gt; A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A SPOKEN WORD OF GOD. A PROPHET'S MESSAGE CAME IN THIS DAY AND SAID, "I'LL HAVE A BRIDE." &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PATTERN. &gt;&gt; OH, I love it. &gt;&gt; This message is packed full. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to take our time. We'll wait for someone to fall out of the rafters. We'll bring him back to life. That's our pattern. &gt;&gt; So, when it says, "When do we get worried about the clock?" I stayed up the other night working on a house. Let's work on the spiritual house. &gt;&gt; You know the pattern is he's not building a wall. &gt;&gt; You got to turn corners. &gt;&gt; You got to turn corners. &gt;&gt; You can't stay where you're at. &gt;&gt; You got to go forward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you stay where you're at, you're going to die. &gt;&gt; That's the pattern. WHY STAY WE HERE? I'M TIRED OF GOING AROUND THE MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; I hear BABYLON'S CALL, BUT I AIN'T LISTENING. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, here's a pattern. Christ is going through the city of Dawn and death goes to try to cross his path. But he was the resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; And that's that that death procession COULD NOT CROSS THE PATH. &gt;&gt; The black mamba death is swallowed up. &gt;&gt; The pattern is Jesus Christ is the resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; And I WHO WAS ONCE DEAD IN SIN AND TRESPASS. &gt;&gt; I'M NOW ALIVE IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; THE PATTERN OF DEATH HAS BEEN BROKEN IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I'VE RECEIVED A FORETASTE THAT TELLS ME I'M OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M NOT SERVING THE DEAD FLESH ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; I WAS DEAD IN SIN, BUT NOW I'M ALIVE IN CHRIST JESUS. WE GOT TO RECOGNIZE WE'VE BEEN REVIVED. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME TO PLAY THE PART OF A SINNER? &gt;&gt; Why would I stay here? &gt;&gt; Tending a grave. I wasn't born for this. &gt;&gt; Now, it would be so close it would deceive the very elect if it was possible. There's a whole I'm I'm afraid some of you who are fortifying yourself in just the truth and your intellectual belief of the truth would probably be confounded by the amount of truth that is out there &gt;&gt; that you could swallow up and envelop yourself in and feed on with itchy ears till the end. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It doesn't have transforming power because it doesn't fit the pattern. God's pattern was to send a prophet with the message &gt;&gt; and you either dip with the prophet or you're out OF THE PROGRAM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOD'S PATTERN. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't change. &gt;&gt; So make yourself I told one guy, I said, "You must be Malach. You must be Elijah because we need one." He's like, 'What do we need prophets for?' I said, 'Well, you must have made yourself one because the Bible says we need one. &gt;&gt; You can't change it. It's It's there. &gt;&gt; How many are having a good time in the Lord? &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I want to lay in there because we're the children of pro promise. And I'm just going to read this because I like it. Ezekiel 37. Now, this is good. Well, all right. We're just going to try to be faithful. You know, there's other patterns. We got Abraham and Sarah. We got a lot of patterns that we could go in and we don't have time. But there's a lot of patterns that you should take as a key and recognize that God can't change that pattern. That that word has to perform the same thing in you. Your confidence is that the word of God can't return void. And as you fortify yourself in the word and said, "Yes, this is God. This is who God is. This is this is how God performs things. This is he can't change. This is the way he does it." and you recognize your position in the word, then you could have faith to believe it for you. &gt;&gt; He comes to those who can't help themselves. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I don't even have the will to move. &gt;&gt; I don't even have the ability to save myself. You're a candidate. &gt;&gt; You're the kind of person my God goes to. He takes the people who are dead in sin and trespass and brings them to life. Why? to bring down that my that pious person who just thought they're better than everybody else, who thought they had just made it on their own effort. And he takes the one WHO WASN'T EVEN TRYING, &gt;&gt; WASN'T even looking for the truth, DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO SERVE GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU BETTER, IF THAT'S YOU, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT GOD ON YOUR TRAIL. &gt;&gt; You better just start believing it. I was trying to read a scripture. Ezekiel 37 1-14. And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out of the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley, which was full of bones. &gt;&gt; You dead sinner, and caused me to pass by them round about, and behold, there was very many in the open valley, and lo, they were very dry. You have no desire to serve God whatsoever. And he said unto me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "Oh Lord, thou knowest?" Again he said unto me, "Prophesy upon these bones, AND SAY UNTO THEM, OH YE DRY BONES, hear the word of the Lord. THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THESE BONES, BEHOLD, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live, and I will lay senu upon you, AND I WILL BRING UP FLESH UPON YOU, AND I WILL COVER YOU WITH SKIN, AND PUT BREATH IN YOU, AND YE SHALL LIVE, AND YE SHALL KNOW THAT I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; You heard it. COME ON, &gt;&gt; YOU OLD DRY BONES. &gt;&gt; You might think that your teenage rebellion is bigger than God, but he's breathing on you. &gt;&gt; He'll make you live. &gt;&gt; And when I beheld, the senus and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them above, and there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, "Prophesy unto the wind. Prophesy, said a man, and say to the wind, thus sayaith the Lord God, come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophecy. God could have spoke to the bones and said, "Rise up." Why would he use the office of man? &gt;&gt; God doesn't use mechanical devices. For some reason, he chose to use man. &gt;&gt; Matthew 28. So, we're a product of a spoken word, of a prophecy. Okay? Your pedigree is just as Jesus Christ could look of all the things that the scripture spoke of him, your pedigree is spoken word prophecy. &gt;&gt; You're here because the word said you would be here. &gt;&gt; He prophesied a word and fore orained you here to receive it. That's why you're here. That's the pattern. That's the power of a prophetic commission. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm not going to read these. The these are the the if if you have a a long day tomorrow and it's late, you you you won't bother me if you leave. But I'm I'm going to just try to stick with this. A lot of times I just cut it off and shut down. But I'm going to just tar with you guys for a minute. &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:18-20. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. This is known as the great commission. This is the basis fundamental framing of Christianity as we know it. You can't get away with the commission. This is the pattern of the church that Jesus desired that it would find itself in the function of. At no time does this is this commission not in effect. Mark 16:15-18. So if you if you want to find and I believe this is where our pastor's heart was. If you're just looking for the basics of knowing where the will of God is in your life, this is a very easy place to land. If you can't land here, then you're not you're not in the in the economy because God wants to use you. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. Preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. And and he that believeth not shall be damned." That's the pattern. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink deadly things, it it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. Luke 24 46:49. And he said unto them, "Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." and ye are the witness of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my father upon you, but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high. Now, that's the prophecy. That's that's the commission. He's given it, but they're powerless. There's even a point in the when he's still there, he breathes upon him and he he sends him out. But he was doing it as a foreshadowing when he breathed on him. The the the Greek words there are actually he he's forboding when he breathes on him that the Holy Spirit's going to come. &gt;&gt; There was a brooding out. There's now once the word is spoken, the Holy Spirit is commissioned. It has no other. It has to now quicken the word and bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; And that is Acts 2:38. this commission. We see it. Then Peter said unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and your children and all them that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. That was prophecy fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This is not that these men are not drunk as you suppose, but that is that which is prophesied by Joel. that gospel has not changed. &gt;&gt; But we're going to buckle this down. You know, there's there's there's patterns. If we looked at it and we didn't belabor, but you have the pattern now through the churches is the pattern of life is cycle and death. Revival and death, revival and death, revival and death. It reminds me of Shamgar as he would sit there. I believe it was him who took the Philistines would come every year right around harvest time and right as when they're going to reap the harvest the enemy would come in and present himself with the the ability to take the crop the ability to steal the harvest. Saints, this harvest is ours. This message has brought us bountiful blessings and it's ours. But you have to stand up and you HAVE TO SAY, "YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; Everything this word HAS PROMISED YOU IS MINE AND BELONGS TO ME. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to LET YOU COME IN AND TAKE MY JOY. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU TAKE MY PEACE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU TAKE ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS TOLD ME IS MINE. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE MY SHOUT. YOU CAN'T HAVE MY JOY. YOU CAN'T HAVE MY BLESSING. YOU CAN'T HAVE THE POWER AND THE MOVING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BECAUSE IT'S ALL MINE. &gt;&gt; The message gave it all to me. &gt;&gt; That's the prophecy. And I want to now let these words brood over you. The magicians could come. This is a prophecy that's now spoken out over you by the message of this age. And I'm going to read it to you and close with it. One night as I was seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to write, his spirit gave me a message for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the word and the bride. I'm not going to read you the whole thing. For those who've read it, here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specy bring forth after his own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielded fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth, and it was so. Whatsoever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. What whatsoever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. And in these last days, the true bride, Christ seed, &gt;&gt; will come to the headstone, &gt;&gt; and she will be the super church, a super race as she nears him. They and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image. &gt;&gt; This is in order to be united with him. They will be one. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Denominations cannot produce this &gt;&gt; wrong seed. &gt;&gt; They will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word. This mongrealizing brings forth a highbred product. The first son, Adam, was the spoken seed word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. This is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God. But she fell. She fell by hybridization. She caused him to die. The second son Jesus also a spoken word spoken seed word of God was given a bride like it was Adam. But before he could marry her, she also had fallen. That's the church ages for those who want to go through it. She's like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die. She doubted it. She left the word. She died. From a little group of the true seed of the word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of his word. She is a virgin because she knows no man creed or dogmas. by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He himself acted at the same time fulfilling his own word of promise in the virgin. It was the angel that had brought her message, but the angel's message was the word of God. Saints, put yourself there. Isaiah 9:6, he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her. The members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials. As he is their head and all power belongs to him, they are subject to him as he as the members of the bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the father and the son. Jesus never did anything until the first showed him by the father. John 5:19, this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride. He shows her his word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride, &gt;&gt; as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; The bride has the mind of Christ, for she knows what he wants done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They are they have thus sayith the Lord or keep still. They know that it is has to do with God in them doing the works fulfilling his word. He did not complete all his works while his earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. She knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. But he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time. Church, rejoice. &gt;&gt; This is a prophetic word. &gt;&gt; It's speaking of you. Are you hearing your name called? Are you saying that's me? That's who I am. That's my identity. I know his voice. I know what he wants done. That's who I am. He spoke it. I had no good report to give of myself. I couldn't speak these things of me. But he's called me his beloved. He's called me his bride. I'm not turning that into some dirty word. He called me his bride. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Favor ain't fair. What you should just be thankful for is that you're the one. &gt;&gt; I can't answer why. I can't tell you why. Why me? Doesn't make sense. [Music] I don't deserve it. Try to run from it. &gt;&gt; But the grace of God, &gt;&gt; but not for the grace of God. And so, what can I testify to? I don't care who you are and how ineligible you think you are. The grace of God is sufficient for you. It may not be in a church service when he comes your way. Oh my. But he's not limited by these four walls. &gt;&gt; You could find yourself outside of this very service sitting in a car &gt;&gt; and he could drop by your way &gt;&gt; and visit you. &gt;&gt; He's not limited in your own way. Thank him, church. You should be able to say, "This is your doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; You spoke this of me. &gt;&gt; Your word cannot fail." What are you having to do in your praise? You're having to cast down your own that line vanity, which is yourself. You know, false pride tells you that, you know, if you're praising him for being elect, that that's just you. No. No. I'm praising the prophecy. &gt;&gt; I'm praising what he said. &gt;&gt; I'm praising him for what he's done. I'm praising them because I can't produce it. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to thank him and I'm going to give them the praise. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you could help me sing that as we turn it over. I know who I am. I know who you are. [Music] The cross of salvation was only the star. Now I am chosen, free and forgiven. &gt;&gt; Oh, you have a future. &gt;&gt; I have a future. And it's worth the living. All singing. Oh, cuz I wasn't made to be tending the grave. I was called by name. Born and raised back to life again. I was &gt;&gt; your bride. Oh, so why would I make a bend in my shame when fountain of grace is running my way? I am yours and I was faithful. [Music] Know who I am. cuz I know who you are. The cross of salvation was only a star. Hallelujah. Now I am [Music] [Music] totally a grave. I was called by name. Born and raised back to life again. I was faithful all. Why would I make a bed in my shame of grace is running my way? I know why. that was made. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful gospel. You know Jesus when they went to the upper room, he gave them that commission. Go into all the world and preach the gospel. I'm alive. I'm raised from the dead. And I'm here. And he sent his spirit and gave them power for one purpose that they could prove to the world that Jesus Christ was resurrected and alive and the same and doing the same works. And that's what he said. The works that I do shall you do also. I go unto my father to prepare a place for you, but I will come again and receive you that where I am, you may be also. That's our message. That's what we're trying to tell the world. And that's our part each, like Davey said, is to prove that he's alive today. And he wants to be alive in each of us. And I know because I I I raised him. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; He he wasn't a preacher when he was in high school. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't meet God for him. I couldn't force rules on them to make them live a certain way. We told them, "Don't you take that that you can drive the van to the football game two blocks from our house." I said, "You drive there and drive home." Lesie and I are laying in bed and we hear sirens. I fly out of bed. I knew I knew something was wrong. We jumped in our car, drove up on the freeway, and there's our van tipped over on the freeway with eight football players in it. You can't you can't teach salvation. &gt;&gt; You can only testify to it. You can't teach the baptism of the Holy Spirit. You've got to demonstrate it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; We're here to prove he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And it starts in the household of faith right here tonight. &gt;&gt; If there's someone sick amongst us, &gt;&gt; we know he's here &gt;&gt; and we know he's alive and we know he's resurrected &gt;&gt; and he wants to use us to prove that. And that's why when we're sick, we come up and are prayed for and anointed with oil and to say, "He's alive." And we're going to stand on his word and our testimony that we know he's alive. [Music] You can't teach that life because it's real. It's really a person who's in our midst. And that's our calling and our commission is to prove he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the power is attached just like today. That's this is a wonderful teaching tonight. Really a wonderful teaching that this he said that's what the church needs. Prophet said it needs teachers. need some to take us back through the word of God and see it in its reality. &gt;&gt; And that's what it's about. It's about him in you, Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's what it's about. And if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in you, it will also quicken your mortal body. And you know, teenagers, our kids, you know, I mean, Dave was no saint and Matthew was no saint. But when Davey got converted, it wasn't by my intellectual teaching. He got converted because he meant God. And he was so on fire for God that he'd wait up every night for Matthew to come home. And one day he got so mad mad at Matthew, he took every single bit of his clothing, everything that he had, and he put it in a box and he threw him out of the house because he meant something that was real and he couldn't stand it. And you can meet something that's real for you. [Music] It starts tugging at your heart and you start knowing you're on the outside of it. &gt;&gt; You hear about the power of God. You hear about the manifestation of the spirit. You hear about the moving, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you know inside of you, you're standing on the outside of it. &gt;&gt; You know it's real. You feel it. you have a a a sense of it, but you just know you're on the outside. And that's the part you got to play. You got to open up. &gt;&gt; And say, I want that in me. &gt;&gt; Paul said it like this. I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the power of God &gt;&gt; unto salvation. &gt;&gt; And young people, teenagers, doesn't matter. There's a little bit of part in you that you know that there's something out here that's God that you know is not in here. All you have to do is ask. All you have to do is get somewhere and start praying. Say, "Lord, I want what I sense that I hear people talk about. I want that in me. I want to know for me." And I promise you, if you do that, in no wise will he turn you away. And I like this song. says, "I wasn't meant to tend a grave." And I thought he brought that out good. We're going to die. And alls I'm doing is tending my grave. I'm not going to live like that. And you go through hard times as a Christian. You backslide as a Christian. You fail as a Christian. But there's something inside of you says, "I was made for more &gt;&gt; and I am going to overcome and I am going to be victorious. Not by my strength, not by my might, but by your spirit." &gt;&gt; And I need that spirit. &gt;&gt; I need that spirit to get it. I need that power &gt;&gt; from you, Lord, to make the gospel live in me. And I was going to preach on that Sunday morning, but Davey beat me to it. So, I'll just repreach it. &gt;&gt; But it's all about the commission. It's all about proving he's alive. &gt;&gt; And where is he alive? He's alive in here. And then you demonstrate him and show him that he's alive out there. And then you start winning souls and people start getting that spirit and the spirit of God starts moving. We're going to move up, church. &gt;&gt; But it took the time to get it back to where we understood that the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is attached to the commission. &gt;&gt; And when all that gets in order, &gt;&gt; go prove to the world He's alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that and let's just let's just bow our heads and in prayer. Father, we're going to be dismissed, but Father, may the kindling fire that we felt this evening, knowing that you're real. And the whole church was built on those men going to that upper room, knowing that they were commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel. But they said, "You go there till you're endued with power on high because I'll be with you even in you till the end, Father." And they went there and your presence came down and they knew it was you and they knew you were abiding in them. And now they could go out and prove to the world that you're alive, Father. That commission and promises to our children and our children's children and them that are far off, Father. And let's let that not die. I just ask, Father, that you reckindle it, that fire, that desire in our hearts not to give Satan an inch and to take possession of every gate that he tries to enter into our families, our children, our bodies, our minds, our hearts, and our spirits. We're going to take the resurrection power and stand there with the word of God. We ask you to grant that to us tonight. Father, may you bring great experience to each of our children, our teenaged boys and girls, our young men and women, Father, that are in a world that hates them. May they step across that wonderful line and pass from death into life. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that verse. I that when I wasn't made to tend a grave. Amen. I I like that so much. &gt;&gt; Tending a grave. I was called by name. Born and raised back to life again. I was made from all. [Music] So why should I make a bed in my shame my ways? I was Oh, let's sing it again. Think about that for yourself. I was made for more than what I do. Be tending a grave. I was called by name. Born raised back to life again. I was made more. [Music] So why would I make a bed in my shame when a fountain of grace is running my way? I know I am yours. I was &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Take these words to heart. Sing it as you go. Pray for Sunday morning. God bless you. Go in peace. [Music] me.
