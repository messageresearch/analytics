[18:08] we're certainly glad to have you with us
[18:10] and then god bless you manager invited
[18:12] by mike for our song reading this
[18:26] morning
[18:28] good morning
[18:33] there's a there's a phrase
[18:36] that the the world often uses
[18:40] when there's a time of crisis
[18:43] or an uncomfortable situation and
[18:47] they make the statement we have a
[18:49] situation
[18:51] be a crisis like a hostage situation
[18:56] could be a financial situation could be
[18:59] a health situation or a
[19:01] job situation but it's it's generally uh
[19:04] uncomfortable or requires some form of
[19:07] crisis management
[19:10] in order to respond to that
[19:13] if we look at psalm 48 this morning
[19:17] there's another kind of situation
[19:22] it says in psalm 48 verse 2.
[19:28] that will start in verse 1 great is the
[19:30] lord and greatly to be praised
[19:32] in the city of our god in the mountain
[19:34] of his holiness
[19:36] beautiful for situations amen
[19:40] the joy of the whole earth is mount zion
[19:44] on the sides of the north the city of
[19:46] the great king
[19:49] this entire chapter speaks about the
[19:52] situation
[19:53] of zion and how she is
[19:57] situated and positioned
[20:00] you know and as we've mentioned in maybe
[20:02] some of our other psalm readings
[20:04] david speaks of zion many times it's uh
[20:07] it's the place where god dwells with his
[20:09] people on the earth
[20:12] and it's always referred to as she
[20:15] as her effeminate it says in verse 2
[20:20] beautiful for situation
[20:24] you know while the situation in the
[20:27] world might
[20:28] be unwelcome zion is beautiful
[20:31] because of her situation amen
[20:35] you know the word describes her as
[20:37] beautiful because of how she's arranged
[20:39] how she's positioned you know if you
[20:41] look at chapter 48
[20:43] you know first of all it says in verse 2
[20:45] the joy of the whole earth
[20:47] you know it isn't that the whole earth
[20:49] rejoices in her
[20:50] or has joy with her but if there's any
[20:53] joy found anywhere it's
[20:54] all there in zion
[20:57] think about it there's nowhere else
[20:58] where you can find a joy
[21:01] at best everything else is a cheap
[21:03] imitation that temporarily occupies us
[21:06] from the reality
[21:07] of the joyless world that we live in
[21:11] but all the joy in the earth is here
[21:14] in zion beautiful for situation and why
[21:18] is there joy there
[21:19] it says in verse 11 what's the source
[21:21] let mount zion rejoice
[21:23] because of thy judgments
[21:26] they rejoice they have joy because of
[21:29] his word
[21:32] what else about his situation it's the
[21:35] place where the great king resides in
[21:37] verse 2
[21:38] it is the city of the great king
[21:43] you know it says in verse 3 god is known
[21:46] in her palaces
[21:48] for a refuge you know is there a people
[21:53] this morning that know him has he been a
[21:56] refuge
[21:57] for you beautiful
[22:00] for situation is zion
[22:05] just one more verse 8 it says as we have
[22:09] heard
[22:11] so have we seen in the city of the lord
[22:14] of hosts
[22:15] in the city of our god something else
[22:18] about zion's situation
[22:20] is here that somebody sees the
[22:23] manifestation of what was spoken
[22:26] it's where hearing becomes seeing
[22:29] it's where word becomes flesh
[22:33] beautiful for situation
[22:36] is zion you know the other thing is is
[22:38] that
[22:39] she's situated in a position that's
[22:41] visible
[22:43] she has manifestation men can
[22:46] see her it says in verse 4 for lo
[22:49] the kings were assembled they passed by
[22:52] together they saw it
[22:54] and so they marveled they were troubled
[22:57] and hasted away jesus describes it this
[23:00] way in matthew 5
[23:01] ye are the light of the world a city
[23:04] that is set on a hill
[23:06] cannot be hid you know and the reaction
[23:09] that men
[23:10] have to this zion is they marvel at it
[23:15] they're troubled at it you know when the
[23:18] situation calls for fear
[23:20] she has joy when the world calls for
[23:24] crisis management
[23:26] she has refuge when
[23:30] times are dark and confused and it seems
[23:32] like you can't believe anything you hear
[23:35] she has clarity and focus and guidance
[23:38] because of his judgments
[23:42] beautiful for situation you know and men
[23:45] don't know what to do with her
[23:47] you know because she won't fall into the
[23:49] narrative of the day of the hour
[23:51] she doesn't get caught up in all the
[23:52] crises of the age
[23:54] but she has joy beautiful for situation
[23:59] do you have a
[24:00] situation this morning do you have a
[24:02] zion
[24:03] situation you know i
[24:06] i pray that we do it's a place of joy
[24:09] it's a
[24:10] his dwelling place it's where the great
[24:12] king is
[24:13] it's where the word becomes flesh let's
[24:16] read
[24:16] in psalm 48 this morning about the
[24:19] situation
[24:20] of zion let's read that together
[24:23] starting at verse 1.
[24:24] great is the lord and greatly to be
[24:27] praised

[24:34] whole earth
[24:35] is mount zion on the sides of the north
[24:38] the city of the great king
[24:40] god is known in her palaces for a refuge
[24:44] for lo the kings were assembled they
[24:46] passed by together
[24:47] they saw it and so they marveled they
[24:50] were troubled
[24:51] and hasted away fear took hold upon them
[24:54] there and pain as of a woman in travail
[24:58] thou breakest the ships of tarshish with
[25:00] an east wind
[25:01] as we have heard so have we seen in the
[25:04] city of the lord of hosts
[25:06] in the city of our god god will
[25:08] establish it forever
[25:10] selah we have thought of thy loving

[57:10] morning
[57:11] didn't god wonderful he he really is
[57:15] wonderful
[57:16] i just like to have say a little
[57:17] testimony before we
[57:19] uh we pray uh you know we
[57:23] we had time constraints with the city
[57:26] and our our time
[57:29] frame ran out so we had to reapply
[57:33] to the to the city to
[57:37] keep going forward with our new
[57:39] sanctuary
[57:40] and so the resolution came up before the
[57:45] city council and so they
[57:48] read the amendment to extend
[57:52] our building process and
[57:55] they took the vote on it
[57:58] and it was the fastest resolution
[58:02] ever passed in the history of
[58:05] the city of bedford so i thought that
[58:08] was pretty good they just got
[58:10] up they read it one guy said that's a
[58:12] no-brainer
[58:13] i second another guy's second and they
[58:16] voted and it was done in about 30
[58:18] seconds
[58:19] and then they all stopped and they said
[58:21] this is the fastest
[58:22] thing that's ever got passed through the
[58:24] city of bedford
[58:26] i said well i sure wish you'd speed up
[58:28] the building part of it
[58:30] but maybe by god's grace it'll go for
[58:33] we certainly welcome all our visitors
[58:37] this morning to that are here with us
[58:40] and but most of all we trust the lord is
[58:43] here with us
[58:44] that he's in your heart and
[58:48] we just hoped this morning that you can
[58:50] feel his love and know that he loves you
[58:53] let's go to him in prayer this morning
[58:56] our gracious heavenly father as we
[58:58] approach your word this morning
[59:01] father it is beyond our physical
[59:03] capabilities or our mental capabilities
[59:07] father to open your word and to speak of
[59:12] you
[59:13] in any light that's worthy of your
[59:16] greatness
[59:18] but lord we humbly approach you
[59:21] and ask that you would stand
[59:24] between the lips of the speaker
[59:29] and the ear of the here
[59:34] and that in that place father you
[59:36] administer yourself
[59:38] to each heart that you would look across
[59:42] this assembly this morning you alone
[59:46] knowing the needs
[59:48] knowing the battles
[59:51] father knowing the questions that are in
[59:53] the heart
[59:55] and father you take a moment
[59:58] this morning to stop at each seat
[1:00:02] to pass by each child
[1:00:06] the young and the old father and just
[1:00:09] reach your hand out
[1:00:11] they give a touch from you lord
[1:00:16] for one moment with you can change
[1:00:19] life forever and ever
[1:00:23] we're needy of you this morning lord
[1:00:28] our vocabularies run
[1:00:31] short when it comes to describe you
[1:00:37] our minds father run out of room
[1:00:40] when it comes to explain you
[1:00:44] but if your spirit would come today
[1:00:48] by divine revelation and that quickening
[1:00:51] power
[1:00:52] you can deal with each heart and that's
[1:00:55] what we asked this morning father
[1:00:58] help us not inject
[1:01:01] our own selves but may you
[1:01:04] father have the preeminence we commit
[1:01:08] this service into your hand this morning
[1:01:10] father may it be a blessing to us
[1:01:14] all in jesus precious name we pray
[1:01:17] amen amen god bless you let's turn
[1:01:21] it to deuteronomy this morning
[1:01:24] and
[1:01:30] the 16th chapter of the book of
[1:01:33] deuteronomy
[1:01:35] and the first three verses
[1:01:48] and this morning were
[1:01:53] ministering out of the message called
[1:01:55] god's chosen
[1:01:58] place of worship and
[1:02:01] this is the next
[1:02:05] sermon in the
[1:02:09] line of sermons that we've been
[1:02:11] following we've just
[1:02:13] been going from each sermon to the next
[1:02:16] sermon
[1:02:17] and trying to draw out little nuggets
[1:02:21] and for where
[1:02:25] that we are so we hope this morning that
[1:02:28] this
[1:02:29] is a blessing we encourage you to
[1:02:33] go back and study it and listen to it
[1:02:37] for yourselves along with your other
[1:02:39] study
[1:02:40] and we trust it'll be a blessing
[1:02:43] so he says
[1:02:46] observe the month of
[1:02:49] abi and keep the passover
[1:02:54] unto the lord thy god
[1:02:57] i'd like to emphasize first of all that
[1:03:00] first word observe
[1:03:03] so that's a commandment observed
[1:03:08] it says and keep the passover unto the
[1:03:10] lord thy god
[1:03:13] for in the month of that
[1:03:17] the lord thy god brought the fourth
[1:03:20] out of egypt by night
[1:03:24] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[1:03:26] passover
[1:03:28] unto the lord thy god of the flock
[1:03:32] and the herd in the place
[1:03:35] which the lord shall choose to place
[1:03:38] his name there
[1:03:42] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[1:03:44] word
[1:03:45] in your precious name we pray amen
[1:03:49] god bless you
[1:03:52] it's
[1:03:56] certainly
[1:04:00] wonderful to
[1:04:04] study god's word and so
[1:04:07] this morning we realized that there's
[1:04:11] lots of questions within
[1:04:14] the framework of the scriptures
[1:04:17] we have questions on our hearts we have
[1:04:20] things that we cross
[1:04:22] we hear people say things and
[1:04:26] our minds are stirred up our hearts are
[1:04:29] stirred up
[1:04:30] but we we know one thing for certain
[1:04:33] that if there's a bible question
[1:04:37] then a bible question has to have a
[1:04:40] bible answer
[1:04:42] if if you have a history question
[1:04:46] and you have a question about history
[1:04:49] you consult
[1:04:51] history so a history question
[1:04:54] gets a history answer and
[1:04:57] a math question gets a math answer
[1:05:01] and so a bible question has to have a
[1:05:04] bible answer it has to have
[1:05:06] something that comes from the scriptures
[1:05:10] to answer and it can't be
[1:05:14] just an answer that
[1:05:18] man provides it's got to be
[1:05:22] an answer that god provides so man might
[1:05:26] provoke the question
[1:05:28] but god is the only one that can answer
[1:05:31] it
[1:05:32] so a bible question can only be answered
[1:05:35] by the lord and that's the thing that
[1:05:39] burns in our heart and so
[1:05:42] there's a kind of a bible question
[1:05:46] wrote into this scripture it says
[1:05:49] observed in this month the passover
[1:05:53] because this is the month
[1:05:54] april that you were brought out
[1:05:57] and he said take up a flock of lamb
[1:06:02] and uh offer that lamb but offer this
[1:06:05] in the place he says
[1:06:09] the place which the lord shall choose
[1:06:13] to to place his name
[1:06:16] there and so our question in is
[1:06:19] where is that where is
[1:06:22] that place so in order to answer
[1:06:26] that bible question and if you're
[1:06:29] commanded to do something you certainly
[1:06:33] want to do it and i and i think this is
[1:06:36] a great
[1:06:38] uh question because i believe what we
[1:06:40] all want to worship the lord
[1:06:42] and so if we our hearts desire is to
[1:06:45] worship the lord
[1:06:47] then there there's got to be a way that
[1:06:51] that we can worship them and so the
[1:06:54] scripture says here he says in a place i
[1:06:57] place my name he says now if it's a
[1:07:00] bible question then we should have a
[1:07:02] bible answer
[1:07:04] and it should not be able to come from a
[1:07:07] group of man
[1:07:09] or any certain fellowship
[1:07:12] or from some educator
[1:07:15] or from some denomination it should come
[1:07:19] straight
[1:07:20] from the scriptures where
[1:07:23] god's meeting place is
[1:07:27] of worship and surely being god
[1:07:31] there is a meeting place
[1:07:34] somewhere that he meets now
[1:07:37] so being god there's got to be a place
[1:07:41] that god meets and we want to
[1:07:45] we want to if we just say that
[1:07:48] in in our heart as we just read a few
[1:07:51] statements but god desires to meet with
[1:07:54] man
[1:07:55] this morning not only does he want you
[1:07:58] to worship
[1:07:59] him but he doesn't just stand afar
[1:08:03] off and so your worship with god
[1:08:06] isn't something that is here and we just
[1:08:10] throw it up into the sky and that's kind
[1:08:13] of our idea of worship
[1:08:15] i think sometimes uh we've changed
[1:08:19] the meaning of worship to praise
[1:08:22] and talk we just he prays on somebody
[1:08:26] and
[1:08:26] and acculates and and many times people
[1:08:30] speak
[1:08:31] things of people and and the greatness
[1:08:34] that they have
[1:08:36] and and the wonders they are i hear
[1:08:39] people talk about
[1:08:40] athletes sometimes of how awesome they
[1:08:43] are and
[1:08:44] how they do this and how they do that
[1:08:46] i'll tell you how you judge how awesome
[1:08:49] somebody is is how they stand at the
[1:08:51] judgment seat
[1:08:53] uh that that proves who's awesome
[1:08:56] and who's not awesome you know uh a guy
[1:09:00] that
[1:09:01] can't pass the word test i don't think
[1:09:04] has got as
[1:09:04] much awesomeness as we think he does
[1:09:08] but they speak to these people and they
[1:09:10] they praise them and they
[1:09:12] they put accolades on them and oh he's
[1:09:15] the and they've never met
[1:09:16] them that they've never met them so
[1:09:20] uh if i could just try out maybe just
[1:09:22] set as we go
[1:09:23] forward this morning that we're trying
[1:09:27] to separate
[1:09:28] what true worship is from just
[1:09:32] praise and and and
[1:09:35] singing we love to sing i love to sing i
[1:09:37] i
[1:09:38] i didn't understand a word the brothers
[1:09:40] were saying this morning but i liked
[1:09:42] every minute of it
[1:09:44] i like the spirit of it i i like the
[1:09:47] enthusiasm
[1:09:48] i i know they were talking about god
[1:09:50] coming and the brother would keep
[1:09:52] singling and i kept looking up he's
[1:09:54] calling god down
[1:09:55] amen that that's what that puts we
[1:09:58] desire we enjoy
[1:09:59] doing that our sometimes our children
[1:10:02] they sing songs
[1:10:04] about the lord and maybe they don't
[1:10:07] fully
[1:10:07] comprehend it all but they they want to
[1:10:10] sing they want to worship they
[1:10:12] they want to be a part and those things
[1:10:14] are all good but
[1:10:16] we're talking about something that's so
[1:10:18] much deeper
[1:10:20] and more intimate the the gods of god
[1:10:24] in the worship we're talking about god
[1:10:27] participates in it part of the worship
[1:10:31] it's it's a it's a greater union than
[1:10:35] it's ever been before so it's a a
[1:10:38] marvelous thing
[1:10:39] he says and so god has a place
[1:10:43] that he meets so there there's a meeting
[1:10:47] a a meeting is a coming together of
[1:10:50] two parts okay you've got to have a
[1:10:53] a this meeting and so this
[1:10:57] meeting that god wants to have
[1:11:00] with his people uh he's the provider
[1:11:05] of that place so okay
[1:11:08] if we could just really get this in our
[1:11:11] thinking to
[1:11:12] this morning of really what it means a
[1:11:15] place
[1:11:16] uh you know it's a place that you go to
[1:11:20] a meeting place if we set up a meeting
[1:11:22] we say well
[1:11:23] i'll meet you at starbucks or i'll meet
[1:11:26] you at
[1:11:27] uh uh denny's i don't think anybody
[1:11:30] meets anybody at denny's anymore but
[1:11:33] uh someplace that that you say
[1:11:36] that you meet so you you you place a
[1:11:40] place there
[1:11:41] and then you say i'm going to meet you
[1:11:44] there
[1:11:44] you know each of us should have a
[1:11:46] meeting place
[1:11:47] with god we're we're encouraged to go
[1:11:51] into our closets we're
[1:11:53] encouraged to find a place that that
[1:11:56] we we uh pray so we
[1:11:59] set aside a place for the meeting
[1:12:03] place but so there's there's got to be
[1:12:07] something that's set
[1:12:09] and so somebody's got to set the
[1:12:11] appointment
[1:12:12] someone's got to choose the place and
[1:12:15] set the place
[1:12:17] and if you want to have lunch i love the
[1:12:20] lunch
[1:12:20] uh uh thing when we decide we're gonna
[1:12:24] have
[1:12:24] lunch together well where do you want to
[1:12:26] meet and you go through this and you go
[1:12:29] through that and you list
[1:12:30] four or five places and then you come up
[1:12:33] with a choice and
[1:12:34] and and then you decide okay this is
[1:12:37] where we're going to meet
[1:12:38] in this case god chose
[1:12:42] the place he chooses the place he
[1:12:46] chooses the meeting place
[1:12:48] now god told them before they
[1:12:51] established the temple and whatever they
[1:12:54] did
[1:12:55] i will choose the place of my worship
[1:13:00] and i will put my name in it and that's
[1:13:04] the
[1:13:05] only place that
[1:13:08] god would ever meet anybody
[1:13:11] was by his own choosing
[1:13:15] now in other words he's just not going
[1:13:17] to meet you in the place you picked
[1:13:22] look he's the one he's only going to
[1:13:25] meet you
[1:13:25] in the place that he chooses he's the
[1:13:29] one
[1:13:29] that makes the choice he's the one that
[1:13:33] that that picks the spot he says he
[1:13:36] and he says he chooses his place
[1:13:40] and where he chooses his place he puts
[1:13:42] his name
[1:13:45] the second verse here tells us that
[1:13:48] he would put his name in the place
[1:13:52] that he had chosen for the people to
[1:13:56] worship him
[1:13:57] in now the thing of it is we want to
[1:14:01] find out
[1:14:03] where that place is
[1:14:08] now why why do we pick a place
[1:14:13] you understand god's got a reason and a
[1:14:16] purpose
[1:14:17] that he chooses the place to meet
[1:14:21] now you're not going to go to a place
[1:14:24] that
[1:14:25] you're not comfortable in you're not
[1:14:27] going to go to a place that
[1:14:29] that that you don't have rest in and
[1:14:32] peace in
[1:14:34] you know you've meant uh
[1:14:38] just in such a carnal natural type but
[1:14:41] it's like we we go to these places
[1:14:43] sometimes and we say well let's meet
[1:14:45] here
[1:14:46] at this place and we've never tried that
[1:14:49] place before
[1:14:52] so we walked in and and we sit down
[1:14:55] and we're having we we've decided to
[1:14:57] meet here and
[1:14:59] fellowship here and the food's bad
[1:15:02] and the place is smoky and
[1:15:06] and the music's too loud
[1:15:09] everything you you you wouldn't go there
[1:15:13] but if you knew that ahead of time you
[1:15:16] would never
[1:15:16] pick that place as a meeting place so
[1:15:20] god knows what ground he can meet
[1:15:23] a man on he can't meet a man
[1:15:27] on a foul ground he can't meet a man
[1:15:30] in a a place that's not clean he can't
[1:15:34] meet a man
[1:15:34] in a place that that there's things
[1:15:37] that's going on that makes him
[1:15:39] uncomfortable
[1:15:40] or that he's not welcome he's not gonna
[1:15:43] set up in a meeting place
[1:15:45] where if i can say it this way he can't
[1:15:48] be himself
[1:15:52] he can't be what he is
[1:15:56] so he's not going to set up this meeting
[1:15:58] place
[1:16:00] on your grounds
[1:16:04] he's not you're not inviting him
[1:16:07] he's inviting you
[1:16:11] amen he's the author of the meeting you
[1:16:14] have not
[1:16:15] chosen me i have chosen you
[1:16:18] he's the one that can send the invite
[1:16:22] to the meeting and he says i will meet
[1:16:25] you
[1:16:26] you are invited to come you are invited
[1:16:30] to come
[1:16:30] meet me but you've got to come meet me
[1:16:33] on
[1:16:34] in the place that i provided
[1:16:37] for you to meet me
[1:16:42] because i know that place
[1:16:45] may i say it like this i can function
[1:16:48] in that place
[1:16:52] as a pastor we we have meetings you know
[1:16:54] people
[1:16:55] want to share something with me or they
[1:16:57] want to tell something
[1:16:59] with me now a pastor will never work
[1:17:01] from hearsay
[1:17:04] you know collect if you if you want to
[1:17:06] meet me don't send your wife
[1:17:08] with the message or don't send it by the
[1:17:12] way of gossip
[1:17:14] you know good don't don't send it some
[1:17:16] other way that's a way of a coward
[1:17:21] you know i i've done it a few times
[1:17:24] myself where i've been embarrassed
[1:17:26] something i did so i i bought something
[1:17:29] or something so
[1:17:30] i send leslie to bring it back
[1:17:34] go take this back i'm too embarrassed
[1:17:37] to to go do this or i don't want to face
[1:17:40] that person
[1:17:41] you know i mean i don't want to admit
[1:17:43] i'm wrong so i just
[1:17:45] fix that
[1:17:48] send my wife you know i mean unless they
[1:17:50] go go take this back for me
[1:17:54] you know what do i tell him well don't
[1:17:57] tell him i made a mistake
[1:18:03] but but you understand when god
[1:18:06] picks a meeting and he picks the place
[1:18:10] after we we have meetings and sometimes
[1:18:13] if the place isn't right
[1:18:15] you're just uncomfortable you can't talk
[1:18:17] maybe someone wants to talk about
[1:18:19] something
[1:18:20] that that's life-changing and you know
[1:18:23] the
[1:18:24] music pounding and the you know the
[1:18:26] people are all there
[1:18:28] and it's all loud and everything and
[1:18:31] you're trying to concentrate and
[1:18:33] and everything and it's just it it's
[1:18:35] just not a place to me
[1:18:37] now can you think that god might
[1:18:40] understand that
[1:18:42] he might understand that he
[1:18:45] wants to control the atmosphere
[1:18:49] of the meeting he
[1:18:52] so he chooses the place he says i'm
[1:18:56] going to meet man
[1:18:57] i'm going to choose the place now god
[1:19:00] told them
[1:19:01] before they established the temple or
[1:19:04] whatever they did
[1:19:05] i will choose the place of worship
[1:19:08] and i'll put my name in it and that's
[1:19:12] the
[1:19:12] only place that god would ever meet
[1:19:15] anybody
[1:19:16] was by his own choosing
[1:19:20] he chose his place
[1:19:25] and where he chooses his place he puts
[1:19:28] his name
[1:19:31] so that's what we so so we we know that
[1:19:33] we have a
[1:19:35] a bible answer here that there there
[1:19:38] might be
[1:19:39] uh uh different
[1:19:42] ideas and and all kinds of
[1:19:45] of different ways that we think
[1:19:49] but god chose where he would put his
[1:19:52] name
[1:19:53] and there's all kinds of different
[1:19:55] religions look there's
[1:19:57] uh uh as a brother testified at the
[1:20:01] a men's breakfast and and i really
[1:20:03] encourage your brothers if you can
[1:20:05] break away on a saturday morning to come
[1:20:07] out and
[1:20:08] and make it out to the men's breakfast
[1:20:12] it's a wonderful time of fellowship but
[1:20:14] the brother was testifying he says i
[1:20:16] tried everything
[1:20:17] he said i even went to utah for for
[1:20:20] four years and lived with the mormons to
[1:20:24] to be a mormon and and to try this and
[1:20:27] to try that
[1:20:28] and you can try a lot of things but you
[1:20:30] finally know
[1:20:32] when you've met god you know when it
[1:20:36] gets the right place
[1:20:37] and and and and so
[1:20:41] he he would uh every other religion that
[1:20:44] they they can't point to a tomb that's
[1:20:47] empty
[1:20:48] they can't point to a resurrected christ
[1:20:52] and so our great question a lot of time
[1:20:56] is how do we know that our god
[1:20:59] is risen
[1:21:02] well we might know it personally in
[1:21:05] ourselves
[1:21:06] but god's got a way of showing that he's
[1:21:08] alive
[1:21:10] he's got a way of play
[1:21:13] making it known that he is capable
[1:21:17] of choosing the place of worship
[1:21:21] and i like this statement because it's
[1:21:23] such a beautiful statement
[1:21:25] he says but christianity was established
[1:21:28] by jesus christ
[1:21:30] and there is an empty tomb
[1:21:34] he was the only man that ever stood
[1:21:37] on earth and lived
[1:21:40] and said i have power to lay my life
[1:21:44] down
[1:21:44] and to raise it up again and he
[1:21:48] did it and he lives today
[1:21:51] now that's a great statement folk if we
[1:21:54] say he lives today it would be a great
[1:21:57] bible question
[1:21:59] to say how do we know he lives today
[1:22:02] and we know he lives today because we
[1:22:04] have a bible answer
[1:22:07] that proves that he lives today
[1:22:10] and it says and we know he lives because
[1:22:13] he
[1:22:13] is with us and proves
[1:22:17] himself by physical
[1:22:20] signs and wonders that he promised
[1:22:24] that he would do
[1:22:27] to show it
[1:22:31] amen he promised how that he would show
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:35] he promised how that i will show
[1:22:38] that that i'm alive because i'll do
[1:22:41] physical signs and wonders to prove
[1:22:45] that it's so look when we talk about
[1:22:49] signs and wonders signs and wonders are
[1:22:51] to prove
[1:22:52] that there's a living resurrected savior
[1:22:56] that's alive and he cares about us he
[1:22:59] thinks about us
[1:23:00] he's mindful of us
[1:23:04] and so we know that christianity
[1:23:07] then is the
[1:23:10] the answer
[1:23:16] to what's truth of
[1:23:19] all of all that's out there
[1:23:23] there's only one faith that can prove
[1:23:26] that their founder if we could use that
[1:23:31] word
[1:23:31] or that their gospel is alive
[1:23:35] and resurrected amen
[1:23:38] i like that because i want
[1:23:42] i want to know that what i'm basing my
[1:23:44] eternal destination
[1:23:46] on israel i i wanna i
[1:23:49] i like the feeling that i have i know i
[1:23:52] have a personal revelation
[1:23:54] i've known for beyond a shadow of a
[1:23:57] doubt
[1:23:58] that he's meant me that he saved me i i
[1:24:01] feel that in my soul i feel it in my
[1:24:04] heart
[1:24:04] but i love when he proves it i love when
[1:24:08] he gives me that exclamation point
[1:24:11] i love when he shows he's standing there
[1:24:13] and he's working on my behalf
[1:24:16] and he's out there ahead of me doing
[1:24:18] things for me
[1:24:19] exceedingly and abundantly even above
[1:24:22] what i can ask or think
[1:24:24] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:26] forever that he's
[1:24:28] real and he's the same
[1:24:31] in other words what he what was
[1:24:33] testified of him
[1:24:34] when he was alive he's doing those same
[1:24:37] things today
[1:24:38] proving that he's the same today and
[1:24:41] he'll be the same tomorrow
[1:24:45] boy that takes a lot of pressure off me
[1:24:50] i like a god that takes the pressure off
[1:24:54] yeah because satan's putting it on
[1:24:57] he said he said i have to listen to
[1:25:00] letting off the pressure
[1:25:02] satan puts it on god lets it off
[1:25:06] blessed be the name of the lord he says
[1:25:10] now if god chooses a place
[1:25:14] it behooves us then to find out
[1:25:18] what he said about it
[1:25:22] where it is i want to find it
[1:25:25] because truly i want
[1:25:29] to worship him
[1:25:33] that i think that's something that's
[1:25:36] really in the heart
[1:25:37] of a believer that you want to worship
[1:25:41] him
[1:25:42] i want to know where that place is
[1:25:46] i i i want to know what he said about it
[1:25:49] i know
[1:25:50] i want to know where it is and i want to
[1:25:53] find it
[1:25:56] now if i if i knew what he said about it
[1:26:01] that would be good and if i
[1:26:05] and and if i knew where it is
[1:26:09] that would be good but i want to find it
[1:26:14] now this morning if if we could say that
[1:26:18] that's that's it's
[1:26:21] we're required to observe this place
[1:26:26] and we're required to worship him
[1:26:30] and and so i think too many times that
[1:26:35] we approach christianity too
[1:26:38] casual
[1:26:42] like it like we can go about it any way
[1:26:45] that we want to or we can have any
[1:26:48] approach to it
[1:26:50] we want to or any other is something
[1:26:52] that we can lay up and lay down
[1:26:55] and walk to and walk away from
[1:26:58] but but that's not what worship is
[1:27:02] this is something that it's a meeting
[1:27:07] it's a face to face it's a one-on-one
[1:27:11] it's it's something that becomes
[1:27:13] personal
[1:27:14] between you and him
[1:27:18] and you know uh when you want to have a
[1:27:21] real meeting with somebody
[1:27:23] you don't invite in a lot of
[1:27:27] hearsayers and a lot of eavesdroppers
[1:27:30] and and a lot a lot of uh
[1:27:33] gossipers you know people that are gonna
[1:27:36] say things and spread things
[1:27:38] uh in political world they call it
[1:27:40] people that leak
[1:27:41] things out you don't want you don't want
[1:27:44] that you want this to be a private
[1:27:46] intimate place because this is worship
[1:27:50] worship is meaning
[1:27:55] that's when you're worshiping is when
[1:27:58] you're having a meeting
[1:28:00] when you're having that one-on-one when
[1:28:02] you're having that
[1:28:03] love affair going on because that that's
[1:28:06] that very personal relationship between
[1:28:10] you and him
[1:28:11] so you want to find out where it is is
[1:28:13] because you
[1:28:14] want to worship him
[1:28:18] now we sing praise together but
[1:28:21] your personal worship is you
[1:28:25] worshiping him
[1:28:29] and you want to know what you're
[1:28:30] worshiping
[1:28:36] and i just think this is such a
[1:28:38] tremendous statement
[1:28:40] he says you don't know what to do
[1:28:43] until you know how to do it
[1:28:48] you don't know what to do until you know
[1:28:51] how
[1:28:52] to do it and and
[1:28:56] so we we know that god so
[1:28:59] god chose this place of worship
[1:29:03] and he was going to identify it by
[1:29:06] putting his name there so if we know
[1:29:09] where
[1:29:10] he put his name then we know
[1:29:14] where that place is and if we
[1:29:17] know where that place is then we can
[1:29:20] find that place
[1:29:21] we can go to that place we can find out
[1:29:25] about that place we can find out
[1:29:27] where it's at and we can go there and
[1:29:31] find it if we know where that place is
[1:29:34] where he put his name and and
[1:29:38] what this place is then we can go there
[1:29:41] if we
[1:29:41] know where that is then we can go there
[1:29:44] and find it
[1:29:48] and so you say is this the place
[1:29:53] well this place is called christian life
[1:29:57] tabernacle
[1:30:01] i don't think that's where he put his
[1:30:04] name
[1:30:10] we come here to fellowship
[1:30:14] we come here to learn of him we come
[1:30:17] here
[1:30:18] to be corrected we come
[1:30:21] here to praise him
[1:30:25] and to encourage one another amen there
[1:30:28] is a church
[1:30:29] natural and there is a church
[1:30:32] a church natural and there is a church
[1:30:35] spiritual
[1:30:37] and this is a church natural
[1:30:40] but within this church natural is a
[1:30:43] church spiritual
[1:30:45] and then that worship god must worship
[1:30:47] him
[1:30:48] in spirit and in truth
[1:30:54] so even within our midst here
[1:30:57] there is a place here it may be within
[1:31:03] this place
[1:31:05] but god still has a place
[1:31:09] if you could picture it like a room or
[1:31:12] or a building
[1:31:13] or a certain thing that's got
[1:31:18] borders or boundaries around it that's
[1:31:21] what makes it a place
[1:31:24] and he's got a place
[1:31:27] and he says and god and he placed
[1:31:31] his name in that
[1:31:34] place
[1:31:38] that's where his name is amen and so
[1:31:42] we can simply find that he says
[1:31:45] god has not chosen to put his name
[1:31:48] in any denomination i want scripture for
[1:31:52] it
[1:31:54] i know they claim he has
[1:31:57] but he hasn't he cannot put his name
[1:32:01] in many places because he said he would
[1:32:05] put his name
[1:32:06] in one place
[1:32:10] in the place that i
[1:32:13] have chosen to put my name
[1:32:17] that's where you worship me and that one
[1:32:20] place
[1:32:21] each one of our denomination wants to
[1:32:24] say that they
[1:32:25] are that place but it's contrary
[1:32:28] but where did he put his name
[1:32:34] amen not titles
[1:32:37] right he didn't put it in titles he
[1:32:40] didn't put it in
[1:32:42] uh uh
[1:32:47] you know
[1:32:50] some sort of
[1:32:53] mystical uh place that
[1:32:56] it doesn't exist it it
[1:33:00] it it's a place now we find out that
[1:33:03] jesus said i came in my father's name
[1:33:08] and you receive me not i believe that's
[1:33:11] john 5 43 then the name
[1:33:15] of the father must be jesus that's right
[1:33:19] the name of the father is jesus jesus
[1:33:22] said i i carry my father's name
[1:33:27] i come in my father's name and you
[1:33:30] receive me not
[1:33:31] then his name was jesus
[1:33:35] now so we realized that god didn't
[1:33:37] choose to put his
[1:33:38] name in a temple he choose to put his
[1:33:42] name
[1:33:42] in a man this is
[1:33:46] my beloved son in whom
[1:33:49] i'm pleased to dwell in
[1:33:53] now do you understand he's fulfilled
[1:33:57] one half of the meeting
[1:34:02] you understand this is my son
[1:34:06] i put my name in him and i'm
[1:34:10] pleased to dwell there so i'm
[1:34:13] dwelling in the place of the meeting
[1:34:19] this is where i chose to put my name not
[1:34:22] in that temple over there
[1:34:24] not in a priesthood not
[1:34:27] in a system or an organization i
[1:34:31] chose to dwell in a man
[1:34:34] that's where i am
[1:34:40] so if you're going to meet me you've got
[1:34:44] to come
[1:34:44] to the place that i chose to meet
[1:34:49] hallelujah
[1:34:53] so we know that
[1:34:56] you can't have the meeting without him
[1:34:59] being there
[1:35:08] i've been in those type of meetings go
[1:35:11] tell my wife
[1:35:14] then and then the wife go tell my
[1:35:16] husband
[1:35:18] and you're like some sort of mediator
[1:35:22] well that's not what you said the first
[1:35:24] time that
[1:35:25] no no she changed your mind
[1:35:28] no that ain't a meeting
[1:35:33] meetings face to face you'll never get
[1:35:37] anything resolved
[1:35:42] it's got to be steadfast
[1:35:47] anchored so he said i'll be there
[1:35:52] i'll be there now it's up to you
[1:35:57] to come you want to worship
[1:36:00] then you've got to come you've got to
[1:36:03] come to the meeting
[1:36:04] i've picked the place just like in the
[1:36:07] greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:08] where there had to be a battle there had
[1:36:10] to be a battle
[1:36:12] where the two places were going to meet
[1:36:14] where the two enemies were going to meet
[1:36:16] where god was where satan was going to
[1:36:19] battle
[1:36:20] man and god was going to battle on the
[1:36:22] behalf of man
[1:36:23] they said okay we've got to have a
[1:36:25] meeting place there'll be a place that
[1:36:27] i'll be
[1:36:28] and there's place for that satan will be
[1:36:31] and that battleground was the mind
[1:36:38] there's got to be a plate that you
[1:36:42] meet well god just wants to have a
[1:36:44] meeting with you
[1:36:46] so he places his name in his son
[1:36:49] this is my beloved son even before he
[1:36:52] was born
[1:36:53] the angel of the lord came down and said
[1:36:56] call him
[1:36:57] jesus
[1:37:02] he'll be emmanuel god with us
[1:37:07] god's with us in christ
[1:37:11] so he picks this place and he comes down
[1:37:15] and he's in that place now why him
[1:37:20] one because he's without sin
[1:37:25] there's nothing there that keeps him
[1:37:28] from being there
[1:37:34] he's clean he's without blemish
[1:37:39] he's a perfect sacrifice he's perfectly
[1:37:43] submitted
[1:37:44] to the will of the father so god finds
[1:37:47] somebody
[1:37:48] a man because god wants to meet with man
[1:37:54] so man can't meet in a realm
[1:37:57] that he's not living in
[1:38:02] you can't you can't make contact
[1:38:06] with something until it comes into your
[1:38:09] realm
[1:38:10] you can't make contact with uh
[1:38:14] uh some sort of alien
[1:38:18] unless that alien comes in to your realm
[1:38:22] or you go in to his realm
[1:38:26] and please don't come and tell me that
[1:38:28] you went up into some
[1:38:30] alien realm
[1:38:35] because god chose to condem sin
[1:38:40] he chose to create a place of worship
[1:38:44] the firstborn the beginning of the
[1:38:46] creation of god
[1:38:48] his son the only begotten of the father
[1:38:52] so he picks a place and he says now i'm
[1:38:55] meeting you
[1:38:56] in this place this is the place i chose
[1:38:59] to meet
[1:39:00] this is where i put his name he'll be
[1:39:02] emmanuel
[1:39:03] which means god with us
[1:39:07] so god's gonna meet man in christ
[1:39:13] that's where we become new creatures is
[1:39:15] in christ jesus
[1:39:18] so god's picked his meeting place and
[1:39:20] there he is
[1:39:22] and now he's identifying he's the place
[1:39:25] i can
[1:39:26] not do these works unless the father
[1:39:28] shows me
[1:39:29] i do nothing in myself but it's the
[1:39:32] father
[1:39:32] that's in me that does the works
[1:39:36] what was he proving
[1:39:39] he was proving this is the place that
[1:39:42] i've chosen
[1:39:43] this is where i put my name this
[1:39:46] is the this is the uh uh
[1:39:50] identified uh place
[1:39:53] that i've put my name and that i'm
[1:39:56] dwelling
[1:39:57] now so this is my meeting place so our
[1:40:00] meeting place is
[1:40:01] in christ jesus
[1:40:04] that's the place and the name
[1:40:08] was placed in a man not a church
[1:40:11] not a denomination not a creed but a man
[1:40:15] he chose to place his name
[1:40:18] in jesus christ and we find out
[1:40:22] that then he becomes the place
[1:40:25] of god's worship where you
[1:40:28] worship him
[1:40:31] now that's half the story
[1:40:37] it's the other half i like
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] because this is beautiful
[1:40:50] look he said even before he was born
[1:40:54] his name was called jesus it was so
[1:40:57] important
[1:40:58] it was given to his mother by the angel
[1:41:00] gabriel
[1:41:02] that his name would be called jesus son
[1:41:04] of god
[1:41:06] what he was and that's what he was
[1:41:11] there we have it then
[1:41:15] it's then
[1:41:19] is it there we have
[1:41:22] it then this is
[1:41:25] it alone
[1:41:28] it is for him alone
[1:41:33] him alone's god's chosen place of
[1:41:36] worship
[1:41:37] god's place chosen god
[1:41:40] chose to meet man was not
[1:41:44] in a church not in a denomination
[1:41:47] but in a creed not in a creed but in
[1:41:51] christ
[1:41:52] that's the only place that god will meet
[1:41:55] a man and he can worship god
[1:41:59] is in christ that's the only place
[1:42:03] no matter if you're methodist baptist
[1:42:07] catholic protestant whatever you might
[1:42:10] be
[1:42:11] there is only one place that you can
[1:42:13] correctly
[1:42:14] worship god that is in christ
[1:42:18] so there's no other worship is accepted
[1:42:22] outside of that
[1:42:26] but we're not talking about group
[1:42:28] worship
[1:42:30] we praise as a group we worship as an
[1:42:34] individual
[1:42:36] because you've got to have something
[1:42:39] that you're worshiping him for
[1:42:43] you don't know how to do it
[1:42:47] until you really know what it is so we
[1:42:50] know this place is
[1:42:51] christ yes
[1:42:54] it's it's jesus christ that man
[1:42:59] that was here had that name placed in
[1:43:02] him
[1:43:04] and from that place
[1:43:07] he put out the invite come unto me all
[1:43:11] ye that are heavy laden
[1:43:13] and i will give you rest come unto me
[1:43:17] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:43:22] come worship have i been with you so
[1:43:25] long and you know not who i
[1:43:27] am he who hath seen me have
[1:43:30] seen the father i am the temple
[1:43:34] of the of god god dwells in me
[1:43:38] i'm not even doing the work he's doing
[1:43:40] the work i don't do nothing until he
[1:43:42] shows it to me first
[1:43:44] which one of you can convict me of sin
[1:43:49] who was he he was emmanuel
[1:43:53] he was god god came down to man
[1:43:58] to reconcile man
[1:44:03] to be reconciled with the father
[1:44:06] in christ jesus now
[1:44:10] why is this place
[1:44:14] so in in beautiful
[1:44:18] and important to us
[1:44:22] because one we're not worthy
[1:44:30] now all of us here want more of god
[1:44:33] that's why you come
[1:44:34] this morning all of you want to learn of
[1:44:37] him
[1:44:38] because he said come learn of me
[1:44:42] and we we we all want to express
[1:44:45] ourselves
[1:44:46] but but no matter how good you are
[1:44:50] you are you still battle your flesh
[1:44:57] because the flesh wars against the
[1:44:59] spirit and the spirit against the flesh
[1:45:02] these two are contrary one to another
[1:45:05] even paul says i die daily
[1:45:08] i bring my flesh into subjection so no
[1:45:11] matter how much you want to be a
[1:45:13] christian
[1:45:14] you still got your nature you still got
[1:45:17] your flesh
[1:45:18] you still got the things that satan can
[1:45:21] tempt you with
[1:45:24] the lust of the eyes the pride of life
[1:45:28] you don't become a christian and satan
[1:45:30] goes away
[1:45:33] he lets you know every day that he
[1:45:36] believes he can still get you
[1:45:43] and he only has
[1:45:46] certain realms that he can approach you
[1:45:49] in
[1:45:50] that's the five senses
[1:45:54] that's how he contacts you feel taste
[1:45:57] touched male
[1:45:59] hearing he attack and then
[1:46:02] he has the emotional side of you
[1:46:05] the emotions you know excitement and
[1:46:09] love
[1:46:09] and conscience and and all the things
[1:46:13] that aren't
[1:46:14] physically tangible but yet you feel
[1:46:17] them
[1:46:18] has anybody ever felt embarrassment
[1:46:22] well i've been embarrassed when there's
[1:46:24] nobody within 100 miles
[1:46:28] i remember something i said or i
[1:46:31] remember
[1:46:31] something i do and i almost look around
[1:46:34] to see if there's anybody
[1:46:36] noticing those are all things you
[1:46:40] feel in that realm
[1:46:44] those feelings in our emotions
[1:46:48] many times we we praise god
[1:46:51] from those realms those realms of the
[1:46:54] census
[1:46:55] are stimulated by atmosphere
[1:47:01] i i read quite an interesting article
[1:47:04] one time
[1:47:05] about you know i i never understood
[1:47:09] why everybody wanted to watch scary
[1:47:12] movies
[1:47:14] and they they say it's a real thing with
[1:47:18] i'm not picking on teenage girls at all
[1:47:21] but
[1:47:21] teenage girls like to go and get scared
[1:47:24] to death
[1:47:28] why is that because it's an atmosphere
[1:47:32] that affects those emotions
[1:47:36] and and being emotional that they they
[1:47:40] and being emotional beings they're moved
[1:47:44] on
[1:47:44] and dealt with more through the
[1:47:47] emotional side
[1:47:48] than they are the physical tangible side
[1:47:51] maybe like a fella
[1:47:53] is so they're given to those
[1:47:56] atmospheres there's given to what's
[1:47:59] created in an
[1:48:00] atmosphere to experience the these
[1:48:03] emotions
[1:48:04] and these feelings and act and this
[1:48:07] realm of senses and so that satan
[1:48:10] uses those
[1:48:14] and so he uses those senses and he uses
[1:48:18] those emotions to plant something in
[1:48:20] your mind
[1:48:24] and then to get you thinking about it
[1:48:26] and considering about it
[1:48:27] and reasoning
[1:48:30] that's why god said i've only got one
[1:48:32] place to battle
[1:48:34] i'm going to give you the best weapon
[1:48:36] and i'm going to put this weapon in your
[1:48:38] mind
[1:48:38] and it's the word
[1:48:42] because he is the word that's what this
[1:48:46] place was this place was the word of god
[1:48:52] no matter where you are young person no
[1:48:55] matter where you are
[1:48:56] middle-aged person no matter where you
[1:48:58] are elderly person it doesn't matter
[1:49:01] the answer to life is god's word
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:09] now let's go back to this meeting place
[1:49:14] this place is pure
[1:49:18] it's holy it's without sin
[1:49:22] it's the lamb of god
[1:49:26] that taketh away the sins of the world
[1:49:31] so this place of meeting god chose to
[1:49:34] to meet was in his sacrificial lamb
[1:49:38] a type of the passover
[1:49:42] also a type of the passover was
[1:49:45] the death angel when that death
[1:49:48] angel went over egypt and was going to
[1:49:52] travel for egypt
[1:49:54] god provided a place
[1:49:57] that they could go into a place
[1:50:01] that they were safe from the death angel
[1:50:05] and if they went into that place
[1:50:08] and they entered into that place it
[1:50:10] didn't matter what they were wearing
[1:50:13] it didn't matter who they were related
[1:50:15] to if you were
[1:50:17] in that place you were safe
[1:50:23] just like rahab that's right
[1:50:26] get them into this room get them into
[1:50:29] this place hang that scarlet friend
[1:50:33] which was a type of the same sacrifice
[1:50:36] that was placed in egypt
[1:50:39] that's how they knew to hang that thread
[1:50:42] because they had the blood on the post
[1:50:44] and if they knew the blood on the post
[1:50:46] kept death away
[1:50:47] they told her hang this scarlet ribbon
[1:50:50] out
[1:50:50] we know what that means hallelujah
[1:50:57] they knew the power of that blood
[1:51:00] they knew the power of that place they
[1:51:03] understood what that ribbon stood for
[1:51:07] when they marched around that city every
[1:51:09] one of those people knew why they were
[1:51:10] there
[1:51:12] they knew what they come out under they
[1:51:14] come under the shed blood of that lamb
[1:51:16] put on the doorpost
[1:51:20] they knew they were safe
[1:51:24] in there now here's god
[1:51:30] he picked the place and he's dwelling
[1:51:33] there
[1:51:34] this is the mediator
[1:51:37] between god and man there's one there's
[1:51:40] only one mediator between god and man
[1:51:43] it ain't saint teresa
[1:51:46] it ain't mary he don't have a secretary
[1:51:52] he's the mediator what do you have in a
[1:51:55] meeting
[1:51:57] hallelujah you have a mediator
[1:52:02] if you have a lawsuit
[1:52:05] god has a lawsuit against us
[1:52:10] we broke his law and the penalty
[1:52:14] of breaking the law is death
[1:52:20] so you've got to you've got to have a
[1:52:22] place so god
[1:52:23] invites you to a meeting
[1:52:27] but you've got to have a mediator
[1:52:32] so god picks this place this place
[1:52:37] that he creates
[1:52:41] now this place invites us
[1:52:47] god's already made his choice he's
[1:52:50] already dwelling there
[1:52:54] he says here i am now i want to meet
[1:52:58] you i'll meet you in here
[1:53:02] but we can't go in there
[1:53:07] i'm a skunk
[1:53:11] he'll know me he'll know what i'm
[1:53:14] thinking
[1:53:16] he'll know how my mom my mind wanders
[1:53:20] he knows how easy i'm tempted he knows
[1:53:23] how
[1:53:24] hot i get he knows i
[1:53:27] fail i'm a failure
[1:53:33] there's no good thing in me
[1:53:36] how am i gonna go in there
[1:53:40] and come face to face
[1:53:44] and meet this almighty god
[1:53:48] that's because he created a place
[1:53:55] that we could go into
[1:53:59] and meet him and leave our flesh at the
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:06] door
[1:54:09] because i paid a price
[1:54:14] because i put the blood over your life
[1:54:18] because i threw everything that you did
[1:54:21] in the sea of god forgetfulness
[1:54:24] i'm inviting you as the mediator
[1:54:28] as a place of worship i'm inviting you
[1:54:31] to come in
[1:54:32] and meet my father
[1:54:39] that's this place
[1:54:42] now paul described it i want you to
[1:54:45] understand it's a place
[1:54:48] it's a place you can come with all your
[1:54:50] faults all your failures
[1:54:52] all your weaknesses all your mind
[1:54:54] battles but because
[1:54:56] he's the mediator
[1:55:00] he is the one that invited you
[1:55:03] to this meeting
[1:55:07] you didn't schedule it he scheduled it
[1:55:14] he sent the invite to you well you're
[1:55:16] yet a sinner
[1:55:18] he sent the invite he found you wherever
[1:55:21] you were
[1:55:22] he went through your life he come down
[1:55:24] your life's path
[1:55:25] he come to the place he came knocking on
[1:55:28] your door
[1:55:29] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:55:32] if you will open up i will come in and
[1:55:35] mediate with you
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:36] [Applause]
[1:55:40] this beautiful place
[1:55:43] it's here
[1:55:47] but we don't go in
[1:55:54] but listen what he says about this place
[1:55:57] paul trying to speak to this place
[1:56:01] the this place is the only
[1:56:04] place that you can correctly worship god
[1:56:08] and that's in christ he says
[1:56:12] he says so now in christ therefore
[1:56:16] he says romans 8 and 1 there is
[1:56:20] therefore
[1:56:21] now no condemnation
[1:56:24] to them that are in christ jesus
[1:56:30] who walked not after the flesh but
[1:56:33] after the spirit now we we misinterpret
[1:56:37] that
[1:56:38] so many times another jesus says i'm
[1:56:41] inviting
[1:56:42] you into this meeting despite your flesh
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:50] i know you got flesh i know you got
[1:56:53] thoughts
[1:56:54] i know you've got feelings but i'm
[1:56:56] inviting you to leave
[1:56:58] that flesh at the door
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:05] don't walk in here according to the
[1:57:08] flesh
[1:57:12] [Applause]
[1:57:20] i put the blood on your flesh
[1:57:27] i paid for that
[1:57:30] now you've got something to worship him
[1:57:32] for
[1:57:35] now you have a ground to meet him on
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:40] now you have something that's real
[1:57:44] you accepted his invite
[1:57:48] by the word you don't prepare
[1:57:53] to get there i love it when
[1:57:58] we want to go out and eat and then we
[1:58:01] kind of measure up how we're dressed
[1:58:06] to pick the restaurant
[1:58:10] well i'll tell you how you pick the
[1:58:12] restaurant not how you dress
[1:58:14] it's how much money you got in your
[1:58:18] wallet
[1:58:22] you can show up in blue jeans in a
[1:58:24] t-shirt and give the mater d a hundred
[1:58:26] dollars he'll give you a table
[1:58:32] you don't care that's
[1:58:35] all the things
[1:58:40] that will stand in between us
[1:58:43] in the meeting
[1:58:46] that we've got to lay down
[1:58:52] because we can't walk according
[1:58:55] to the flesh you can't walk into that
[1:58:58] meeting
[1:58:59] according to the flesh because he's not
[1:59:02] going to meet you
[1:59:04] on the basis of your flesh he's going to
[1:59:07] meet you
[1:59:07] on the basis of your divine inheritance
[1:59:11] and the fact that you're his son you're
[1:59:14] his daughter
[1:59:15] your name is on that book he recognizes
[1:59:18] of who you
[1:59:19] are and that's who he wants to meet
[1:59:23] he wants to meet his children
[1:59:29] he don't care well you were yet a sinner
[1:59:33] he died for you he knows you're battling
[1:59:36] your flesh
[1:59:37] he knows you're trying to get sin out of
[1:59:39] your life he knows you're trying to
[1:59:41] perfect
[1:59:42] he knows if you're trying to purge you
[1:59:45] wouldn't be there for the meeting if you
[1:59:48] weren't
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:54] he knows you want the meeting so he
[1:59:57] provided a place
[2:00:01] that you could come just as
[2:00:04] you are
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:08] he provided it a place that you're free
[2:00:12] to come into with all your weaknesses
[2:00:16] all your shortcomings all your troubles
[2:00:19] all your sicknesses he says i'll still
[2:00:22] meet you
[2:00:27] when they offered a lamb couldn't have a
[2:00:30] blemish on it
[2:00:32] this lamb had no blemishes so he was the
[2:00:36] perfect sacrifice
[2:00:37] and everybody that was underneath that
[2:00:40] sacrifice
[2:00:42] was saved is that
[2:00:46] right and it's just like
[2:00:49] she says what we can make
[2:00:53] we can differ upon creeds
[2:00:57] we can differ upon man-made theories
[2:01:00] we can go to the methodist church you
[2:01:03] can have to be a methodist
[2:01:05] a baptist a
[2:01:08] presbyterian a catholic a catholic
[2:01:13] but once you're baptized into christ
[2:01:17] and become a member of his body
[2:01:20] there is no differences
[2:01:25] the middle wall of partition is tore
[2:01:28] down
[2:01:29] and you are free because you're in
[2:01:32] christ jesus and you are worshiping god
[2:01:36] in spirit and in truth
[2:01:40] when you are in christ jesus it's god's
[2:01:43] plan
[2:01:44] for you to worship him in
[2:01:47] christ jesus no differences
[2:01:53] i i i just i wanted to do this i thought
[2:01:55] about it all night long and oh i'm going
[2:01:57] to do this and then
[2:01:59] i thought it might not work but i i
[2:02:02] thought i was going to get maybe brother
[2:02:03] jomon here and then
[2:02:06] okay maybe brother manuel and and okay
[2:02:09] and then get brother
[2:02:10] hoel and and and if maybe five or six or
[2:02:14] seven
[2:02:15] different brothers from different
[2:02:17] countries uh
[2:02:18] different ethnicities to different ones
[2:02:22] and
[2:02:22] and so we could recognize all the
[2:02:25] difference
[2:02:29] and then i thought well i'll assign him
[2:02:31] a denomination
[2:02:34] right so you know maybe
[2:02:38] brother manuel would be methodist and
[2:02:41] and uh
[2:02:42] you know maybe brother dylan would have
[2:02:44] been disciples of christ
[2:02:48] all different
[2:02:52] all appear different all have different
[2:02:57] ideas maybe different taste
[2:03:00] and food maybe different styles of dress
[2:03:02] everybody's
[2:03:03] different but once
[2:03:07] you come into him
[2:03:12] there's no difference
[2:03:18] no differences
[2:03:21] [Applause]
[2:03:23] we've all entered into through the same
[2:03:26] door i am the way the truth the life
[2:03:30] no man cometh unto this meeting nobody
[2:03:34] comes to the father
[2:03:35] but by me i'm the meeting place
[2:03:43] and before you can walk into that
[2:03:45] meeting you've got to accept
[2:03:48] what he did for you
[2:03:49] [Applause]
[2:03:52] amen he provided the wedding garment
[2:03:58] when someone tries to come in there
[2:04:00] without the garment he goes and says hey
[2:04:02] how did you get in here you didn't come
[2:04:06] through me
[2:04:10] and let me say this you cannot worship
[2:04:13] him
[2:04:14] with condemnation
[2:04:18] there is no condemnation in that meeting
[2:04:21] place
[2:04:23] he provided a place
[2:04:26] that we do not have to feel condemnation
[2:04:30] when we go there to meet him
[2:04:35] free from condemnation
[2:04:39] if you've accepted
[2:04:43] that i'm the mediator
[2:04:47] the lord speaking i set this meeting up
[2:04:50] i know my father can't meet with you
[2:04:55] in the condition you're in the thoughts
[2:04:58] that you have in
[2:04:59] your mind the weaknesses that you have
[2:05:03] you would perish in his presence
[2:05:08] but i he chose me
[2:05:11] because i so loved you
[2:05:15] that i laid my life down for you
[2:05:19] i'm the mediator i'm the patersionary
[2:05:22] i'm the one that allows you to
[2:05:26] come into the father and talk and have a
[2:05:29] meeting with the father
[2:05:31] because i'm the place that he came
[2:05:34] in and i made a way for you
[2:05:37] to come in there
[2:05:42] oh now we're not walking according to
[2:05:44] the flesh
[2:05:48] but we're coming in by the spirit
[2:05:51] lord i don't deserve to be here
[2:05:55] but my master
[2:05:59] and my lord arranged this meeting
[2:06:03] and he said i can have this meeting with
[2:06:05] you
[2:06:06] and i can come in here and worship you
[2:06:08] with a pure
[2:06:09] conscience because if your conscience
[2:06:11] condemns you
[2:06:12] god is greater than your heart if your
[2:06:15] heart condemns you
[2:06:16] he is greater than your heart i can come
[2:06:19] in here
[2:06:20] because he told me my name was written
[2:06:23] on the lamb's book of life
[2:06:26] [Applause]
[2:06:28] and i was predestinated to have this
[2:06:31] meeting
[2:06:31] that's the only place he meets you
[2:06:35] is in christ denominations will crumble
[2:06:40] and fall nations will pass away
[2:06:44] but he will remain forever no other
[2:06:48] place
[2:06:49] that a man can find to worship god
[2:06:53] that god will speak back to him
[2:06:59] a lot of people have one-sided
[2:07:03] worship but remember what we preached
[2:07:06] last week after the mountaintop
[2:07:10] the juniper tree after the juniper tree
[2:07:15] the cave and what takes place in the
[2:07:19] cave
[2:07:20] the steel small
[2:07:24] voice what is a cave it's a cliff in the
[2:07:27] rock
[2:07:31] a place that you can go and you can hear
[2:07:34] from god
[2:07:37] oh satan's a finger pointer you can't go
[2:07:40] in
[2:07:41] you can't go in here let me give you the
[2:07:43] list of all the thoughts you had last
[2:07:52] week
[2:07:55] man wow you're unbelievable
[2:08:01] how are you gonna go in i've been
[2:08:06] invited
[2:08:12] how can i go in there because it's a
[2:08:15] place
[2:08:17] that was made and
[2:08:21] created with
[2:08:25] everything within it that allows
[2:08:28] god to be there and me to be there
[2:08:31] at the same time it's a special
[2:08:35] created place and it's called christ
[2:08:38] jesus our lord
[2:08:44] oh my a place i can leave my flesh
[2:08:47] oh it's i got so much more i'm just
[2:08:50] gonna skip
[2:08:53] because you have the wonderful book we
[2:08:56] understand in that place
[2:08:58] the death angel couldn't come
[2:09:01] amen there's no other name under heaven
[2:09:04] given among men whereby a man
[2:09:08] must be saved
[2:09:12] we know that in acts 4 12 before he
[2:09:15] baptized him in the name of the lord
[2:09:17] jesus christ
[2:09:18] they were telling him and this very one
[2:09:21] that
[2:09:21] you crucified he has made lord
[2:09:25] and savior and nobody there's no
[2:09:27] salvation
[2:09:28] outside of him he's the wake the truth
[2:09:32] we know that that's where he's dwelling
[2:09:34] but i'd like us to jump because
[2:09:37] uh if i could do that this morning
[2:09:42] and and you can go back and
[2:09:45] and it just it's just so beautiful
[2:09:49] so how many things that the prophet of
[2:09:53] god
[2:09:54] brings out that we want to understand
[2:09:58] why it's so important
[2:10:01] for us to have this meeting with god
[2:10:07] so we know the place of worship is jesus
[2:10:10] christ himself
[2:10:13] that place is his spirit that places his
[2:10:16] nature
[2:10:17] that places his love that and that's the
[2:10:20] only thing
[2:10:22] that we can enter in by is by his love
[2:10:25] he so loved us that he laid down his
[2:10:28] life for us
[2:10:29] that he covered our sins that he paid
[2:10:32] the price for him
[2:10:33] that he threw him in the sea of god's
[2:10:35] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[2:10:38] if you don't accept that a hundred
[2:10:40] percent for yourself
[2:10:42] you will walk in there with condemnation
[2:10:45] and
[2:10:45] he cannot be worshipped with
[2:10:47] condemnation
[2:10:48] because there's no condemnation in
[2:10:50] christ and if you're
[2:10:52] trying to worship god full of
[2:10:54] condemnation
[2:10:55] your worship can't be received and he
[2:10:58] receives
[2:10:59] worship from no other place but through
[2:11:02] him
[2:11:06] and that's what we know so our great
[2:11:08] question is
[2:11:09] is how do we get into there
[2:11:14] how do we get into there by one spirit
[2:11:18] we're baptized not a second third person
[2:11:21] not an emotional experience but by one
[2:11:24] spirit
[2:11:27] that's the spirit we're baptized with
[2:11:29] what was his spirit
[2:11:32] i will never leave you i will never
[2:11:36] forsake you
[2:11:37] i will not leave you comfortless but
[2:11:40] i'll be with you
[2:11:41] even in you till the end if you cast
[2:11:44] your cares upon me
[2:11:46] i careth for you
[2:11:49] if you confess your sins i am just
[2:11:53] and faithful to forgive you that's
[2:11:56] the spirit of god amen how are you born
[2:11:59] again by
[2:12:00] accepting his spirit
[2:12:04] his nature not an anointing
[2:12:08] you accept his promise you accept what
[2:12:11] he
[2:12:12] said you accept what he did for you
[2:12:15] you let that love come into your heart
[2:12:21] that the love of god might be shed
[2:12:24] abroad
[2:12:24] in your heart by the holy spirit
[2:12:29] when they're in that upper room
[2:12:32] that that presence that come down
[2:12:35] it bore witness to his word
[2:12:40] they didn't receive anything that they
[2:12:42] hadn't heard
[2:12:44] they didn't receive anything that was
[2:12:47] promised my good friend doug mchughes
[2:12:51] he's gone on to be with the lord many of
[2:12:53] him you know him from his testimony i
[2:12:55] love that man
[2:12:56] and i can honestly say that man loved me
[2:13:00] because he's a christian he would have
[2:13:03] loved me despite
[2:13:04] myself look he said david brother ben
[2:13:08] told me this
[2:13:09] he said brother doug he said you can
[2:13:13] fast until you're as skinny as a
[2:13:16] toothpick
[2:13:19] you can cry until there's no tears left
[2:13:22] in your eyes
[2:13:25] you can pray and kneel on your knees
[2:13:28] all night long until they're raw
[2:13:33] he said you can shout and cry out till
[2:13:36] you have
[2:13:37] no more voice but god will never
[2:13:40] do any more for you than what he said
[2:13:44] he would do
[2:13:49] god keeps his word and if he ever does
[2:13:52] one thing one way
[2:13:54] he does it the same every way
[2:13:57] when you accept his spirit
[2:14:01] when you totally accept with nothing
[2:14:04] you've done
[2:14:05] no nothing you bring but you come just
[2:14:09] as you are
[2:14:10] and you lay yourself down and say lord
[2:14:13] i'm
[2:14:13] accepting what you've done for me i'm
[2:14:16] accepting the spirit that forgives me
[2:14:19] i'm accepting the spirit that will
[2:14:21] instruct me
[2:14:22] i'm accepting the spirit that'll lead me
[2:14:25] and
[2:14:26] guide me into all truth and
[2:14:28] righteousness
[2:14:29] i accept your spirit i take this
[2:14:32] leadership
[2:14:33] into my life
[2:14:37] i don't have a thing except for what you
[2:14:41] promised me and what you give me and i
[2:14:44] accept
[2:14:46] this word and i'm taking on
[2:14:50] the baptism wherewith you were baptized
[2:14:53] with
[2:14:54] in other words i'm taking on the nature
[2:14:57] that you have
[2:14:58] i'm taking on the judgment that you have
[2:15:01] i'm going to do things the way you do
[2:15:04] things i'm giving my life
[2:15:06] to follow you and when i fail i'm going
[2:15:09] to cry out abba father
[2:15:11] and you're just and faithful to forgive
[2:15:14] therefore i can come
[2:15:15] with that spirit that approach
[2:15:22] may i use the word that attitude
[2:15:25] lord jesus i'm entering into this
[2:15:28] worship place
[2:15:29] to meet your father based on
[2:15:32] your word no
[2:15:36] righteousness i bring i'm coming in here
[2:15:38] based on what you said
[2:15:41] what you said you did for me what you
[2:15:43] said
[2:15:44] was no longer laid to my charge who can
[2:15:47] lay
[2:15:47] anything to the charge of god's elect
[2:15:52] and when we can humbly come before him
[2:15:55] with that place
[2:15:56] that's how we enter into that place of
[2:15:58] worship
[2:15:59] we come through the spirit that he is
[2:16:04] and he is the word
[2:16:07] what's going to happen
[2:16:11] if you have this meeting can you put up
[2:16:14] paragraph
[2:16:16] 90. and i'm closing
[2:16:20] right here
[2:16:24] brother trevor will be ministering for
[2:16:27] us tonight
[2:16:27] so i command you all to come back
[2:16:34] for some reason i know that won't work
[2:16:38] because he commands us to be baptized in
[2:16:40] the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:16:42] he commands us to take communion he
[2:16:45] commands us to do foot washing
[2:16:47] and we don't do that so obviously my
[2:16:49] command's not holding no weight but
[2:16:54] and it ain't even communion sunday
[2:16:58] i just want to make sure you know that
[2:17:00] you've entered in
[2:17:02] to that place paragraph 90.
[2:17:07] god had a certain place
[2:17:10] he meant he met abraham
[2:17:14] and there abraham worshiped
[2:17:17] all down through the testament now let's
[2:17:20] listen to these next words closely
[2:17:25] and his promised word
[2:17:29] will be interpreted in
[2:17:32] you by him
[2:17:43] all right he's made all these promises
[2:17:48] he's got to meet you meet you there he
[2:17:51] has
[2:17:51] no other place to worship what's another
[2:17:54] word
[2:17:54] for worship union fellowship
[2:17:58] becoming one with the promise for our
[2:18:02] day
[2:18:02] the worship of our day is the invisible
[2:18:06] union
[2:18:06] of the heavenly bridegroom in the
[2:18:09] earthly bride
[2:18:11] it's the coming together
[2:18:14] as one word husband and wife
[2:18:17] bride bridegroom they become one
[2:18:21] you are christ you are messiahs
[2:18:25] you are the word so now he says
[2:18:29] when you have this union and you
[2:18:32] come into this meeting and you have this
[2:18:35] fellowship
[2:18:36] in this place
[2:18:39] what is the result of that meeting
[2:18:44] what is the result of you meeting
[2:18:48] face to face with god that's why he said
[2:18:51] no preacher has a right to be in the
[2:18:53] pulpit
[2:18:54] until they've been on the back side of
[2:18:56] the desert and they've met him
[2:18:58] face to face paul said i didn't come to
[2:19:01] you with enticing words
[2:19:04] and the wisdom of man but i came to you
[2:19:06] with the power
[2:19:08] and demonstration of the holy spirit
[2:19:10] because
[2:19:11] he said and now he's interpreting his
[2:19:16] word
[2:19:16] that i have a message to the gentiles
[2:19:19] he's
[2:19:20] interpreting that word in me
[2:19:23] now listen this is the most beautiful
[2:19:25] two paragraphs
[2:19:26] i hope it excites you
[2:19:29] and he promised and his promised word
[2:19:32] will be interpreted
[2:19:34] in you by him his promised word was
[2:19:38] interpreted in abraham
[2:19:42] through abraham because abraham meant
[2:19:45] him
[2:19:46] in the place that god chose to me
[2:19:52] did you get that the word
[2:19:55] that he promised to fulfill
[2:19:59] in the day that you're living in
[2:20:05] you are written epistles of god
[2:20:08] read of all men
[2:20:11] not what you claim
[2:20:15] but what god does
[2:20:18] through you
[2:20:19] [Music]
[2:20:21] will speak out louder than
[2:20:25] anything you could claim
[2:20:29] god said these signs shall
[2:20:32] follow them that believe that
[2:20:36] speaks through you
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:49] through you how can it speak through you
[2:20:54] because you've come face to face you've
[2:20:57] met them
[2:20:58] you've been in there you took the invite
[2:21:02] you've came into christ and he said
[2:21:05] if you come into me the works that i do
[2:21:09] you shall do also because you're going
[2:21:12] to meet
[2:21:13] the same god i'm at
[2:21:18] amen that's who he's
[2:21:21] inviting us to the same god that i meant
[2:21:25] the same god that came in me i was
[2:21:28] spotless
[2:21:29] but because i was spotless i was able to
[2:21:32] lay down
[2:21:33] and make a way for spotless you
[2:21:38] to come into his presence and meet him
[2:21:42] that now through my sacrifice
[2:21:46] and my words and my
[2:21:50] promises in other words
[2:21:53] he said all that the father hath given
[2:21:57] me
[2:21:58] will come every promise i
[2:22:01] made because i laid my life down
[2:22:05] for you he will keep every promise
[2:22:09] i made to you and that will
[2:22:12] live through you if you've had
[2:22:16] the meeting
[2:22:19] he says i just want to read it again the
[2:22:22] word that he promised to fulfill
[2:22:25] in the day that we're living in
[2:22:29] you will be a written
[2:22:33] epistle of god
[2:22:38] read of all men
[2:22:44] everybody is going to see that you are
[2:22:47] the fulfillment
[2:22:49] of what he promised in the day
[2:22:54] not what you claim
[2:22:57] but what god does through you
[2:23:02] we can lay down the claims
[2:23:05] and let them speak
[2:23:09] speak yes
[2:23:13] here we are we've met them written
[2:23:16] epistles
[2:23:17] my life speaks of my experience
[2:23:23] but what god does through you will speak
[2:23:26] out louder than anything you could claim
[2:23:30] god said these signs shall follow them
[2:23:32] that believe that speaks through you
[2:23:35] he spoke of this age
[2:23:39] what would be now the believer
[2:23:43] of this age has
[2:23:46] to believe this what
[2:23:49] he promised today
[2:23:52] just the same as they had back
[2:23:56] into the ark to be saved
[2:24:01] they had to come into the ark to be
[2:24:03] saved
[2:24:06] go out of egypt to be saved
[2:24:10] they have to come into christ to be
[2:24:13] saved
[2:24:15] now into the word message
[2:24:19] that he's the same yesterday
[2:24:23] today and forever how do you get in it
[2:24:27] by baptism
[2:24:29] by baptism of what water by the holy
[2:24:33] ghost
[2:24:34] one spirit we are baptized into one body
[2:24:38] and his promised word
[2:24:42] he will you won't have to interpret it
[2:24:46] he will interpret it through you
[2:24:50] what you are doing what he
[2:24:54] promised to do the church that follows
[2:24:58] him
[2:24:59] will be so much like him until
[2:25:02] the people will know it
[2:25:09] what did they say these are
[2:25:12] ignorant and unlearned men
[2:25:16] but they've been with that guy that did
[2:25:18] all the miracles
[2:25:22] now what are they doing they're doing
[2:25:24] the same thing
[2:25:26] you see he's not in a church
[2:25:29] he's not in a doctrine he's in a place
[2:25:33] that he created that you can come into
[2:25:37] because he provided it what a beautiful
[2:25:41] relationship we have
[2:25:44] with the lord jesus
[2:25:47] i think of all the years i spent as a
[2:25:50] catholic
[2:25:52] all the candles i lit the plastic
[2:25:54] statues
[2:25:57] all the times i confessed my sins to the
[2:26:00] priest
[2:26:04] i just thought mine and one day
[2:26:08] i got an invite
[2:26:14] and i didn't want to go in there i knew
[2:26:17] i was dirty
[2:26:22] i i i i use
[2:26:27] some forms of drugs
[2:26:30] and i didn't want to give them up
[2:26:36] i tried to figure out ways i could be a
[2:26:38] christian
[2:26:42] i used to go around saying you know
[2:26:44] jesus used to smoke
[2:26:51] you know that worked for a while jesus
[2:26:54] had long hair
[2:26:57] all that stuff worked but you want to
[2:26:59] know something he never quit inviting me
[2:27:02] i never quit calling and pretty soon i
[2:27:06] wanted it more than i wanted that
[2:27:10] just like them just like the man he
[2:27:12] wanted what that man had and every time
[2:27:15] that says he said i want some of what

[2:27:25] and that guy get up there and he looked
[2:27:27] at them boots

[2:27:45] on
[2:27:46] and i got a stetson hat on all wrapped

[2:27:56] to climb over that fence and he was
[2:27:58] going to go

[2:29:17] the preparations
[2:29:18] i've already made the preparation i
[2:29:21] prepared the place
[2:29:23] i made it so you could come in dressed
[2:29:26] any way that you are
[2:29:29] wealthy poor smart
[2:29:32] stupid stupid people have a better
[2:29:36] chance than smart people
[2:29:43] we never confess we're stupid
[2:29:46] well i just finally realized i'm one of
[2:29:48] the smartest people in the world
[2:29:50] i was smart enough to take his invite
[2:29:56] but i didn't do that by my strength i
[2:29:59] did it by his grace
[2:30:01] and his mercy but understand this place
[2:30:05] that if we enter into that place he
[2:30:08] promised us
[2:30:09] that he would interpret his word
[2:30:13] through us and that
[2:30:16] he would live his life
[2:30:19] out through us and isn't that our
[2:30:22] heart's desire
[2:30:24] this place that he made
[2:30:28] that he put himself was christ jesus
[2:30:32] if you haven't met him
[2:30:35] his invites to you if you've read about
[2:30:39] him
[2:30:40] you've seen him moving but you haven't
[2:30:42] found that
[2:30:44] personally ask him
[2:30:48] lord will you lead me to this place
[2:30:52] will you come and make this real to me
[2:30:56] will you set up a meeting between me
[2:31:00] just the way i am in the father
[2:31:04] that he can speak back to me and what do
[2:31:07] you think he said
[2:31:09] when i finally went there on that
[2:31:12] rooftop
[2:31:13] and i read that bible and that spirit
[2:31:16] came down and said your sins
[2:31:21] though there many are forgiven
[2:31:24] go and disbelieve no more
[2:31:30] thank you lord amen always remember
[2:31:36] i remember just i remember how i felt
[2:31:41] i felt i could i well the prophet of god
[2:31:45] said
[2:31:46] you're free
[2:31:49] and that's how i felt i felt free
[2:31:53] and now i want to come back to that
[2:31:56] place
[2:31:59] i want to lay down my religion i want to
[2:32:02] lay down my
[2:32:03] doctrines and my philosophies and
[2:32:06] everything i've learned
[2:32:10] all the things i know about the godhead
[2:32:12] and the laying on the hands of the sick
[2:32:15] and those things will do
[2:32:17] if god so permit but i want to walk
[2:32:20] out of my flesh leave my flesh at the
[2:32:24] door
[2:32:25] walk into his promise and have a face to
[2:32:28] face
[2:32:29] meeting with him again that he can
[2:32:32] interpret
[2:32:33] his word in me
[2:32:37] and he promised it he will do it
[2:32:41] that could never forget it's all about
[2:32:44] him it's all about what he provided for
[2:32:49] us not what we do
[2:32:52] for him he's done it all right
[2:32:55] let's stand together and
[2:33:02] brother billy is going to lead us in
[2:33:05] worship
[2:33:07] we're going to do something a little
[2:33:08] different we have three baptisms
[2:33:12] but we're going to go ahead and worship
[2:33:15] we're going to
[2:33:16] pray for anybody that needs to pray for
[2:33:19] we'll
[2:33:19] close the service and then we'll have a
[2:33:22] baptismal service
[2:33:23] afterwards for whoever wants to stay so
[2:33:27] we're not going to hold you
[2:33:29] through the baptism and like we normally
[2:33:32] do
[2:33:33] we want to do something but these people
[2:33:35] that are coming to be baptized they have
[2:33:37] a desire in their heart
[2:33:39] to have this meeting and to have their
[2:33:42] sins remitted
[2:33:44] and that they can enter in to this place
[2:33:47] of fellowship because there's no other
[2:33:50] place
[2:33:50] that god accepts or will meet man
[2:33:54] except in christ jesus let's bow our
[2:33:56] heads and pray
[2:33:59] our heavenly father
[2:34:03] this place you so
[2:34:07] created it you so made it
[2:34:11] you so designed it that we could come in
[2:34:16] just as we are
[2:34:19] the only thing father is is we have to
[2:34:21] accept the
[2:34:22] invite accept the word
[2:34:25] accept the spirit take that spirit that
[2:34:29] you
[2:34:29] had into our heart
[2:34:33] walk in their father and sit down and
[2:34:36] listen
[2:34:37] for that still small voice
[2:34:40] and lord you'll speak and bring your
[2:34:43] word to path
[2:34:45] oh i'm i'm thrilled father
[2:34:48] i'm thrilled in my heart because i know
[2:34:51] what you have in store
[2:34:53] for them that love you the scripture
[2:34:57] says it hasn't even entered into the
[2:34:58] hearts of men the things that
[2:35:00] god has prepared for them that
[2:35:03] love them but father you've gave us a
[2:35:06] glimpse
[2:35:08] through the revealed word of the hour
[2:35:10] you've given us a glimpse of the
[2:35:12] messenger
[2:35:14] father you put that sheaf in that wave
[2:35:16] offering out in front of us
[2:35:19] you sent that eagle
[2:35:22] swooping down a cross
[2:35:27] to give that eliezer cry
[2:35:31] lord and it caught our attention
[2:35:33] [Music]
[2:35:34] and you invited us to fly into the
[2:35:38] heavenlies
[2:35:40] lord and i know that we all got
[2:35:46] parts of our lives that we don't like
[2:35:50] we've all got things that we need to
[2:35:52] improve on
[2:35:55] we all got things in our memory that
[2:35:57] we've done that we wished we never
[2:36:03] but father to think that you've invited
[2:36:07] us into this place
[2:36:08] knowing all that and you made a
[2:36:12] provision
[2:36:14] that we could enter in
[2:36:18] and come and meet with you
[2:36:21] and you could talk to us
[2:36:26] we could talk it over with you
[2:36:30] you could say father i'm sorry
[2:36:33] that i'm so weak
[2:36:37] would you please strengthen me
[2:36:42] father these bad decisions just
[2:36:46] seem to sneak up on me and
[2:36:50] they catch me like a snare i don't even
[2:36:52] see it and then i find myself all
[2:36:55] entangled
[2:36:58] lord i don't want to do that
[2:37:03] i want to grow
[2:37:08] in your word father
[2:37:13] i want to be able to
[2:37:16] see satan and every one of his tricks
[2:37:22] i want to be able to take your word
[2:37:26] and live by it for men shall not live by
[2:37:29] bread alone
[2:37:31] but by every word that proceeds out of
[2:37:33] the mouth of god
[2:37:36] father i want to worship you with my
[2:37:40] life
[2:37:41] amen not with my voice
[2:37:46] because you said that you living through
[2:37:48] me that my actions would
[2:37:50] speak louder than any word that i could
[2:37:52] say
[2:37:54] and you promised in this day that men
[2:37:57] would know it
[2:38:01] that they could look upon a believer and
[2:38:04] be able to say there's something
[2:38:05] different about that man there's
[2:38:08] something
[2:38:08] different about that person they've
[2:38:12] meant
[2:38:12] something they've come in contact with
[2:38:14] something
[2:38:15] that's changed them
[2:38:19] father you said in your bible that those
[2:38:21] people that see
[2:38:23] that would inquire of us what is our
[2:38:26] hope
[2:38:29] lord and we can tell them about a
[2:38:30] meeting place
[2:38:34] we can tell them about a place that you
[2:38:36] came to
[2:38:39] that we could come to also
[2:38:43] and then christ jesus we could come face
[2:38:45] to face with our creator
[2:38:49] and receive resurrection
[2:38:52] and eternal life
[2:38:55] father i know i wasn't capable of even
[2:38:59] beginning to express it
[2:39:01] in its depth but father all's i can do
[2:39:05] is express it with words but you can
[2:39:07] bring it into a reality
[2:39:10] i can talk about the meeting father but
[2:39:12] you can make the meeting
[2:39:15] and i ask that you make it for every
[2:39:17] heart
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:21] i would ask father if there's anyone
[2:39:23] this morning that's sick in their body
[2:39:27] and they would like to raise their hand
[2:39:32] [Music]
[2:39:35] father maybe they have a loved one like
[2:39:37] our brother's steph and his
[2:39:42] believe it's his mother's brothers in a
[2:39:44] hospital

[2:39:58] for observation lord and you know i want
[2:40:02] to eat fish with him again

[2:40:19] they
[2:40:20] they just don't know how to navigate
[2:40:24] through the circumstance
[2:40:28] and lord i already believe your hands
[2:40:32] moving
[2:40:34] but father i pray that we wouldn't lose
[2:40:37] any of our children this morning

[2:40:44] hands for themselves and for others

[2:41:52] you under
[2:41:54] a spirit of forgiveness and a spirit of
[2:41:56] love and lord i want to become
[2:41:59] acquainted with that spirit and come in

[3:20:01] god bless you nice to have all of you
[3:20:03] that have stayed for the
[3:20:05] baptismal service to once again
[3:20:08] watch people come and ask god to change
[3:20:11] their lives and
[3:20:13] to do something for them
[3:20:17] whether would you like to say anything
[3:20:19] right now no
[3:20:23] the water's cold but uh
[3:20:28] it is death by the way so
[3:20:32] therefore let all the house of israel
[3:20:35] know assuredly
[3:20:37] that god hath made the same jesus
[3:20:40] in whom you have crucified both lord and
[3:20:43] christ
[3:20:44] and when they heard this they were
[3:20:46] pricked in their heart
[3:20:48] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[3:20:51] apostles
[3:20:52] men and brethren what shall we do
[3:20:56] then peter said unto them repent
[3:21:00] and be baptized every one of you
[3:21:03] in the name of jesus christ for the
[3:21:05] remission of sins
[3:21:07] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[3:21:09] holy ghost
[3:21:11] for this promise is unto you and to your
[3:21:14] children
[3:21:15] and to all that are far off even as many
[3:21:18] as our lord our god shall call
[3:21:21] and with many other words did he testify
[3:21:23] and exhort
[3:21:25] saying save yourself from this upwards
[3:21:28] generation amen
[3:21:35] my brother the word of god said to go
[3:21:39] into all the world
[3:21:41] preaching the gospel and baptizing them
[3:21:44] in the name
[3:21:45] of the father the son and the holy ghost
[3:21:48] and by divine revelation and the keys to
[3:21:51] the kingdom
[3:21:52] peter knew that that name was no other
[3:21:55] name where a man could be saved
[3:21:57] save the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:22:00] the scripture commends us that all
[3:22:03] things that we do
[3:22:04] to do in the name of the lord jesus
[3:22:08] we know that there's no other name
[3:22:09] greater than the name of jesus
[3:22:12] so according to god's word our brother
[3:22:14] we baptize you
[3:22:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:22:21] [Applause]
[3:22:55] he has a son and daughter
[3:23:09] if it makes you feel any better
[3:23:14] okay you can our gracious heavenly
[3:23:17] father
[3:23:18] lord this young sister wants to be
[3:23:22] baptized in your name

[3:23:26] right thing to do and

[3:23:33] into all the world and preach the gospel
[3:23:36] and to baptize them in the name of the
[3:23:38] father the son
[3:23:40] and the holy ghost peter with the keys
[3:23:42] to the kingdom and divine revelation
[3:23:45] knowing that that name was none other
[3:23:48] than the name
[3:23:49] of the lord jesus christ we baptize our
[3:23:52] sister in the name of the lord jesus
[3:23:56] christ
[3:23:58] [Applause]
[3:24:51] you've got a wonderful testimony that
[3:24:52] you want to say a few words
[3:24:55] um yeah so when i go baptized it was in
[3:24:58] 2013
[3:25:00] and um i got baptized
[3:25:03] in the names of like the father the son
[3:25:06] and the holy spirit
[3:25:07] so it was just like the name as um
[3:25:11] instead of like the name and the church
[3:25:13] that i got baptized in they gave me the
[3:25:16] identification card and then um
[3:25:20] i knew that it was the true baptism was
[3:25:22] that the church that i was going
[3:25:24] um in and then um when i came to the u.s
[3:25:29] i was like i need like a place where to
[3:25:32] worship
[3:25:33] and then i went to um this church called
[3:25:36] ancient but i just didn't feel like i
[3:25:39] had a community in there so i was like
[3:25:41] god just show me where uh
[3:25:45] i would like worship and just deepen my
[3:25:48] relationship with you
[3:25:49] then i came across people um who
[3:25:53] wanted me to do bible study with them
[3:25:55] and then we talked about
[3:25:57] baptism and what it should be but like
[3:26:01] the way they taught it to me was just
[3:26:04] different from everything
[3:26:05] and then i have a brother who lives in
[3:26:08] goma where i'm from
[3:26:10] and he's been listening to the message
[3:26:14] like the audience of brother branham and
[3:26:18] then
[3:26:18] i asked him about baptism and he sent me
[3:26:21] the
[3:26:22] audio so that i could just listen to
[3:26:25] them myself who was like i don't want
[3:26:28] me to like tell you things i just want
[3:26:30] you to hear
[3:26:31] like from yourself and then um he gave
[3:26:34] me the
[3:26:35] audio regarding baptism and i was like
[3:26:38] oh no i can't believe that i go baptized
[3:26:42] like this way and i've been like holding
[3:26:45] you know to eat thinking that is the
[3:26:47] right one
[3:26:48] when it's not the right one so i was
[3:26:49] like yeah
[3:26:51] this is um the right baptism that i want
[3:26:54] to like
[3:26:54] um get baptized in and yeah i asked him
[3:26:58] so
[3:26:59] what should i do i feel like i'm ready
[3:27:00] to do it the right way this time
[3:27:03] and then he gave me the number of um
[3:27:07] someone from jeffersonville and then
[3:27:11] because he didn't have like any contact
[3:27:12] with somebody here in texas
[3:27:15] then the person in jefferson will give
[3:27:19] my number to brother teddy
[3:27:23] from this church and then yeah so that's
[3:27:26] how i
[3:27:28] got to come here and
[3:27:31] yeah my time here like i've been blessed
[3:27:34] and

[3:28:15] true revelation of baptism

[3:28:22] the place of worship and the baptism
[3:28:25] that comes with that place of worship
[3:28:27] is in the name of the lord jesus christ

[3:29:43] just got put out on the street from
[3:29:47] our friendly uh law enforcement officers
[3:29:50] and
[3:29:51] so anyway he found his way here and
[3:29:54] orlando put him to work
[3:29:57] and started working for us and the lord
[3:30:01] has just been dealing with his heart and
[3:30:03] now he wants to be baptized
[3:30:05] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[3:30:08] and so we just are grateful
[3:30:12] for that in god's moving
[3:30:16] so last week we had a wonderful
[3:30:20] opportunity uh to baptize andre
[3:30:24] and and uh and you know the pools opened
[3:30:28] whosoever will
[3:30:30] amen so we just pray that the promise
[3:30:34] that of
[3:30:35] receiving the holy spirit follows
[3:30:38] that by the spirit of god
[3:30:41] our brother's life comes subject to the
[3:30:43] word of god and that we can see the
[3:30:45] redeeming power of god
[3:30:47] manifested in his life chris according
[3:30:50] to god's word
[3:30:52] and the commandments to go into the
[3:30:54] world and preach the gospel
[3:30:57] lord you heard the gospel through a man
[3:31:00] that met you
[3:31:01] in the back of this church and he told
[3:31:04] you the good things of god and
[3:31:07] when you entered into a fellowship and
[3:31:11] made yourself present and then you
[3:31:14] decided to come and be baptized
[3:31:16] so we carry out your request
[3:31:20] and the promises that you receive the
[3:31:22] gift of the holy spirit
[3:31:24] that the token can come across your life
[3:31:27] and and the blood redeems you and
[3:31:30] cleanses you from all unrighteousness
[3:31:33] with this great hope and this great
[3:31:34] promise
[3:31:36] and knowing the power of god to
[3:31:38] transform

[3:31:42] jesus christ
[3:32:00] these are truly people from the highways
[3:32:02] and byways
[3:32:05] amen so you know

[3:32:10] what we can after saying
[3:32:12] amen
[3:32:15] to him this is brother danny these are
[3:32:18] one of the brothers that brother

[3:32:30] into dallas and they met him at a
[3:32:33] a homeless camp in dallas
[3:32:36] and they shared the gospel with them
[3:32:40] and they felt the love of those brethren
[3:32:43] and wanted to come in
[3:32:45] greater contact with the things of god
[3:32:48] they've come to several services and
[3:32:51] they also want god to do something
[3:32:54] that could change their life and
[3:32:57] just do something uh wonderful cosmon

[3:33:25] things so we're
[3:33:26] feeling the promise of god's word
[3:33:29] trusting that the lord will keep his
[3:33:32] promise to danny and
[3:33:34] fill him with the holy ghost and provide
