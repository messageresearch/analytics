[37:22] bombarding the people all the time but
[37:24] when you come to church when you come
[37:26] when you read your Bible when you read

[37:47] armor of God that ye may be able to
[37:50] stand against the V the the the Wilds of
[37:54] the
[37:55] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[37:58] and blood but against principalities
[38:00] against Powers against rulers of
[38:03] Darkness uh of Darkness of this world
[38:06] against spiritual wickness wickedness in
[38:09] higher place it says wherefore take unto
[38:12] you the whole armor of God not just part
[38:16] of it the whole of it everything that is
[38:18] said that you may be able to withstand
[38:20] in the evil day it says and having done

[38:39] where withth ye shall be able to quench
[38:41] the all the fierce Dart of the wicked
[38:43] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[38:45] sword of Faith which is the word of God
[38:51] let's also
[38:52] uh uh uh turn in first uh 1 John chapter
[38:56] 4 we just just going to read one verse
[38:58] uh uh verse four it
[39:01] says ye are of God that's right little
[39:05] children and and overcome them because
[39:09] greater is he that is in you than he
[39:12] that is in the world father we ask you
[39:14] bless your word to us in the name of
[39:16] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have
[39:18] your seats
[39:19] tonight so like I said when I this
[39:22] morning and and perhaps to change my
[39:25] direction a little bit by hearing what
[39:27] we heard this morning you know bam
[39:30] speaks and he says we we live in the
[39:32] hour of
[39:34] identification and if you think about it
[39:37] and you look uh outside you know the
[39:40] world this is for the first time in
[39:42] Mankind's history where man is not
[39:45] afraid uh uh to express himself for
[39:48] everything that they are I growing up
[39:51] even he's a young person you know the at
[39:54] the time to hear people speak about
[39:57] almost sexuality was something unheard
[39:59] of and even if that existed it was so
[40:02] those people they hid themselves they
[40:04] didn't want to express themselves fully
[40:06] and openly and and as it is today in
[40:09] other words we've come to a place where
[40:11] people have such a boldness and I'll say
[40:13] Satan has a boldness to come and flat
[40:16] out just reveal himself for who he is
[40:19] and they would press and they would in
[40:21] fact it's the law it's known as the law
[40:24] of the minority trying to change the ma
[40:26] majority
[40:27] so it's the very few of them they're
[40:29] trying to influence the majority to
[40:31] believe what they are people are they
[40:34] identify as we heard this morning with
[40:36] whatever they want to identify some
[40:38] animals some objects some everything and
[40:41] they give themselves you know identify
[40:43] as he she him him them and all of those
[40:46] things just confusing you like where
[40:48] were there you know when uh English was
[40:50] being taught at school and and it it's
[40:53] like people have a boldness to just come
[40:55] out and say those things like it never
[40:57] was before and he shows you the time and
[40:59] the season in which we are living in and
[41:02] Bam says that the world will get darker
[41:04] and darker it'll get worse and worse and
[41:07] we are seeing those realities before us
[41:09] and I want to say this if Satan is bold
[41:11] enough to come out of the closet and do
[41:13] that then there has to be a people bold
[41:16] enough to come out of whatever you find
[41:18] yourself in to express yourself to
[41:21] because God promised that there will be
[41:23] a believer at the end time he didn't ask
[41:26] I don't know uh will there be a believer
[41:28] really no God predestinated a group of
[41:31] people to stand here in the face of the
[41:34] evil that's here today in the face of
[41:37] the darkness that's here today and
[41:39] represent God for the fullness of who he
[41:42] is amen and let me even say this Satan
[41:46] came and he took Eve out of he deceived
[41:48] Eve out of God's Eden that he created
[41:52] with all the Perfection God in the end
[41:54] time is sending a word to come to say
[41:57] Satan's
[41:58] eeden he says oh you say oh it's dark
[42:01] and it's all kinds of things and God
[42:04] said it's in that dark time it's in that
[42:07] confusion time it's in the time where
[42:10] the things that you're hearing you can't
[42:11] believe with your own ears the things
[42:13] that you are looking at you can't
[42:15] believe with your own eyes God said it's
[42:17] in that time that I'll have a people
[42:20] called by my own name it's in that time
[42:22] that I'll have a group of people that
[42:24] will stand and they will still represent
[42:26] me
[42:28] we we are not afraid of the devil we are
[42:31] not ashamed of what we believe in what
[42:33] we believe in is the word of God is the
[42:35] true reality of what we promised will
[42:37] happen at the end time he promised that
[42:40] the darkness will be there and there's
[42:41] Darkness out there but he also promised
[42:44] that there shall be light in the evening
[42:45] time and there's going to be a people to
[42:47] stand and represent that
[42:50] light so we find out so people come and
[42:53] they identify themselves and I want to
[42:56] say this the the end time message is
[42:58] your
[42:59] identification oh I tell you this I
[43:01] didn't know who I was before I received
[43:03] this message I was in all kinds of sin
[43:06] and even when we were in religion the
[43:09] only religion we know was whether if you
[43:11] were catholic you thought there were
[43:13] three uh uh uh three gods and you were
[43:16] part you all kinds of just nonsense and
[43:18] all those things and if you were in some
[43:20] kind of religion All you thought was oh
[43:22] sinner is me I need the mercy of God and
[43:25] and God came and you looked at Jesus
[43:28] sitting up there on his throne and he
[43:30] died for me I'm here trying my best that
[43:32] I could and so I can be right so I could
[43:35] be accepted and every time you did wrong
[43:38] and you felt like your sin was being
[43:40] weighed in the balance oh I did wrong
[43:42] today I'm going to go to hell and I need
[43:44] to do more right so I can balance my
[43:46] wrong oh it's not until the message of
[43:49] the hour came by my way it showed you
[43:52] that he has nothing to do with that it
[43:54] showed you that's the Trap of the devil
[43:57] that you are predestinated and called to
[43:59] be a son to begin with whatever you are
[44:02] doing is something you are trapped into
[44:04] it but the reality is your heart wants
[44:06] to serve God the reality is God plac a
[44:09] seed in your heart there's not enough
[44:11] darkness that can cover it and when you
[44:13] heard it you say that's what I want to
[44:18] be you say I I don't want Darkness
[44:21] there's no desire for darkness in my
[44:23] heart my my heart wants to see light and
[44:26] my heart wants to see God manifested my
[44:29] heart wants to see the fullness of God
[44:31] dwell in
[44:33] me so he brought you the original
[44:37] identification that God had for you in
[44:39] the
[44:41] beginning the Devil by deception the
[44:44] prophet will say he came and he caused
[44:46] Eve to fall and and yeah you were uh
[44:50] because of the Fall you were born in sin
[44:52] and Sheed in iniquity and and and
[44:55] carried with you the nature of human and
[44:58] and picked up all that there is with
[45:00] human all the failures of human all the
[45:03] thinking of human all that they could
[45:06] all the nonsense of humans that's what
[45:08] you carried with you but it wasn't until
[45:10] you met the message of the hour it
[45:13] wasn't until the revelation of this word
[45:15] came by your way that you begin to
[45:17] realize that I'm not really what I
[45:20] thought I was I'm not really what I
[45:22] thought I needed or what I was and what
[45:25] I desire of the things of the world my
[45:27] heart wants
[45:29] God what was it God bringing you to you
[45:33] your identification at the end
[45:37] time the world called you as we heard
[45:41] this morning oh you're just a a
[45:46] worker McDonald's worker like we're
[45:49] heard oh you're just a teacher you're
[45:52] just an engineer whatever you do you're
[45:54] just a whatever your trade is you're
[45:57] just a carpenter you're just this and
[46:00] and and and we put more value into that
[46:04] we go around when somebody ask you who
[46:06] are you that's the first thing that come
[46:09] out oh I I what do you do who are you
[46:12] I'm this and we say proudly this is what
[46:15] I am but the word is announcing to you
[46:19] that before you were a carpenter you
[46:21] were Son of God before you were a
[46:23] teacher you were a Son of God your
[46:26] original ident ification is to be a son
[46:29] that's why it's important when we live
[46:32] our lives we understand that everything
[46:34] else that we do in the flesh is supposed
[46:36] to be secondary that the true the true
[46:39] identification and motive of living is
[46:42] to represent Jesus Christ is to know
[46:45] that I'm here as the bride of Christ I'm
[46:47] here to be the light to this dying
[46:50] generation it's not to be caught up in
[46:53] your job and in the things that you need
[46:55] to do how much money you can make and
[46:57] let me tell this tonight that's what the
[47:00] world is
[47:03] after the the identification of the
[47:06] world today oh I I want to be like an
[47:09] Hollywood star and I want to be like
[47:12] this great YouTube uh uh uh uh uh
[47:15] celebrity they call them I want to be
[47:17] like this and you'll see it and all they
[47:19] do is Flash money left and right and
[47:22] flashh success but behind they're
[47:24] committing suicide
[47:27] behind it they're not happy behind it
[47:30] there's all kinds of nonsense go greed
[47:33] going on they killing each other there's
[47:35] trapping each other and all kinds of
[47:37] things happening they don't have the
[47:39] happiness that you think that let me say
[47:41] this there's only one happiness and
[47:43] that's in Jesus
[47:45] [Applause]
[47:46] Christ let me tell you young people what
[47:48] you see on YouTube is not true I I have
[47:52] seen people and I'm like they look happy
[47:55] all the time what happened they it was
[47:57] just putting up a face to attract you so
[48:00] you can click more and they can get more
[48:02] money but yet they got the money but
[48:04] they're still not
[48:05] happy money never brings happiness the
[48:09] more money you have the more problem
[48:10] you're going to get the more Fame you
[48:12] have the more trouble you're going to
[48:14] have oh but if you can have the Lord
[48:16] Jesus in your heart it will bring you
[48:19] peace that surpasses understanding it
[48:21] will bring you Joy that surpasses
[48:24] understanding if why because you are
[48:27] candidate for the Rapture why because
[48:29] there's something that tells you that if
[48:32] this world is gone I have another place
[48:35] that I'm
[48:36] going but those people this is the only
[48:39] thing they
[48:42] have so the prophet will come
[48:46] and the the so the end time message the
[48:50] prophet is sent to open our eyes to show
[48:53] us that we are more than what the flesh
[48:56] is
[48:58] is that there in us there is something
[49:01] that's worth more than just what the
[49:03] flesh is looking like that's why you
[49:06] never judge a person by what they can
[49:09] have Earthly speaking they just because
[49:12] a person may not have a good job or they
[49:14] may not have enough money you don't
[49:16] judge them by that you judge them by
[49:19] their character by What Spirit lives
[49:22] inside of them you judge them by what
[49:24] they have because in them there's a Soul
[49:26] that's worth 10,000 World why because in
[49:29] them there's a God there's a living God
[49:32] that lives within them so he came to
[49:35] show us that you are more than the flesh
[49:37] you are more than your job you are a
[49:39] predestinated son of God you have been
[49:42] place here for the predestination and
[49:45] the manifestation of the end time that
[49:47] God has in his store so the prophet will
[49:50] the word will speak and say therefore
[49:52] let this mind be in you that was also in
[49:56] Christ and I ask you tonight what
[49:59] mine the scripture says that he Tau it
[50:03] not robbery to be equal or identified
[50:07] with
[50:08] God being in flesh being Immortal going
[50:13] about with a man who would get tired a
[50:15] man who would need to drink and and need
[50:17] a place to sleep he says let it be let
[50:20] that mind that was in him be also in you
[50:24] why because while he yet still had the
[50:26] identification of the flesh but he knew
[50:29] that within him there was the Living God
[50:31] that dwells inside of him he didn't
[50:34] identify himself according to his flesh
[50:36] but his identification was where he came
[50:43] from he taught it not robbery he taught
[50:46] it not out of place or not something out
[50:50] of
[50:54] reach you a son of God
[50:57] well I am but you know I have this flesh
[51:01] you
[51:02] know you know the scripture speaks we do
[51:05] the Greater Works I don't know how I'm
[51:07] going to get through the Greater
[51:11] Works so you think it's robbery to be
[51:13] equal with
[51:15] god oh well you know I have but I don't
[51:18] know if I can be that kind of God I
[51:21] don't know if I can get that type of of
[51:24] of be that kind of person that can
[51:26] really pray for the SEO that can really
[51:28] do the Greater Works and you know I'm
[51:30] probably just called to come to church
[51:32] and go home and no that's not the god
[51:34] that I'm serving because if you say that
[51:37] then you break the promise and the
[51:38] scripture says the scripture cannot be
[51:40] broken because you have to understand it
[51:43] was God's purpose in the end time and
[51:45] let me say this tonight there's no
[51:47] reason for you to be defeated tonight
[51:51] you have no right to be defeated why
[51:53] because Christ came and he paid the
[51:55] price of sin
[51:57] he paid the price of your sin and
[51:59] everything and how you came as a human
[52:01] he paid for that he paid for that so you
[52:04] can have the right to step in and say
[52:06] I'm a Son of
[52:09] God am so by you saying that I can't you
[52:14] are selling short the very price that he
[52:16] paid why because he paid that price so
[52:19] you can claim what belongs to you and
[52:22] let me say this in his first coming when
[52:24] he came it was for the purpose of paying
[52:27] the price he came he died on the cross
[52:29] he spilled his blood he did all of that
[52:32] for the penalty of sin something had to
[52:34] be paid but after he paid but at the
[52:37] opening of the seals as the prophet will
[52:39] tell us he's coming for the second time
[52:41] for the claiming work in other word he's
[52:44] coming for to take what belongs to him
[52:48] to take what he died for he's not coming
[52:51] to ask he's coming to claim
[52:54] it so a son say Daughters of God we
[52:57] don't go to the devil oh the devil
[52:59] please give it to me please leave my son
[53:02] alone please leave my wife alone please
[53:04] leave my children no we come to kick him
[53:08] out we come to kick him out we have been
[53:12] given the authority to kick him out why
[53:15] because we have been empowered by the
[53:17] word to kick him
[53:19] out huj but whatam says the end time
[53:22] when the Holy Spirit come to the end
[53:24] time is for hunting
[53:27] not for just looking for hunting is to
[53:31] come to drag you out of sin to drag you
[53:33] out of whatever you are in why because
[53:36] if you are predestinated to be a son
[53:38] there's nothing that can stop that God
[53:40] is going to lay you down on your bed
[53:42] he's going to lay you on your back until
[53:44] you come in that's
[53:47] right but yet we are
[53:51] in we make all kinds of excuses and the
[53:54] reasons why we can
[53:58] obtain so we are living
[54:00] in the time of
[54:03] identification what was in the
[54:06] beginning what was in the M God's mind
[54:09] in the beginning for this age God is
[54:12] bringing it into
[54:13] manifestation and the spirit of God is
[54:16] here calling out the elect out of the
[54:19] church coming out from among them and be
[54:23] separated that's the cay of the hour God
[54:26] God is calling out a people for his own
[54:28] for his name's sake God is continuing is
[54:33] here to take people if people call out
[54:36] from remember the scripture will tell us
[54:38] that at the age of laoda Jesus was found
[54:42] outside of the church and therefore he's
[54:45] now personally knocking at each door and
[54:48] he that would open he will come and S
[54:50] with
[54:51] him so the world as we would say will
[54:56] will speak and he will say yeah we are
[54:59] we are living in a time where the world
[55:01] is constantly influenced and the world
[55:03] is coming and and and yet they are being
[55:06] influenced by the deception of the devil
[55:09] to be in the situation that they are in
[55:11] because they have rejected the word and
[55:13] all they have left is deception of the
[55:16] devil dragging them left and right and
[55:19] he will take and it will sprinkle a
[55:21] little bit of Christianity in it it will
[55:23] say well because I go to church that
[55:25] means I'm saved
[55:26] because I pay my thighs that means I'm
[55:28] saved no you're
[55:32] not be because I'm there every day no
[55:35] you're not you must be born again you
[55:39] must have the spirit of God moving in
[55:41] your being you must have something
[55:43] inside of you that's dragging you to
[55:45] church something inside of you that God
[55:48] has deposited that's been Birth by the
[55:50] word of God something that desire to
[55:53] please God every day something that he
[55:55] himself selfish place inside of you that
[55:58] helps you overcome the things of the
[56:06] world but will
[56:09] speak oh I like this in the message
[56:13] Jehovah
[56:14] jar it says paragraph
[56:19] 51 61 02:26 it
[56:22] says no man can come to me
[56:28] no man can come to me except my father
[56:31] draws him and I like that because I
[56:35] believe that's the very Foundation of a
[56:37] Believer it's not something you build
[56:39] yourself it's something that God done
[56:42] and then he says all that the father
[56:43] have given me will come it says will
[56:47] come will come will come to me what it
[56:51] says what are you scared about what are
[56:55] you afraid he says well you
[56:58] say
[57:00] well maybe I'm not the kind of Christian
[57:04] I'm not the I'm not the right kind of
[57:09] Christian he answers back and says how
[57:12] can you come to God without God calling
[57:16] you
[57:19] first think about it it's just as simple
[57:23] we we skip over the we we try to find
[57:26] and it's almost like we resolving like a
[57:29] a geometry
[57:33] equation oh well maybe I'm not the the
[57:36] right kind of a Christian he said well
[57:38] how can you come to God without God
[57:40] calling you first it says and all that
[57:44] he forew he has called is that right all
[57:48] that he has called has he justify is
[57:51] that right all that he has Justified he
[57:53] has Al he has already passed
[57:56] had glorified amen it's a finished work
[58:01] from the foundation of the
[58:04] world you you're not the one starting to
[58:07] work you're not the one starting to show
[58:10] God that I'm interested in coming to you
[58:13] no this is a finished work from the
[58:15] beginning God chooses the place God
[58:18] chooses the time God chooses the season
[58:21] to attract it to
[58:24] him we are fighting against a finished
[58:27] work and you know what happened you're
[58:29] going to
[58:31] lose because it's not you that started
[58:34] the work it's not you that will finish
[58:36] the work you are just part of the work
[58:39] that's happening he that started the
[58:41] work will finish the work we let me let
[58:44] me even say this this work was completed
[58:46] before you can even be made known in the
[58:49] [Applause]
[58:51] flesh but yet we are we are fighting as
[58:54] if we have anything to do to change it
[58:57] no it's finished it was done in his mind
[59:00] before it could be spoken he was already
[59:02] done and when he spoke it he confirmed
[59:05] the finished part of it so when you come
[59:08] the only thing that can happen is you'll
[59:10] be swept by the
[59:12] work the work that called you the work
[59:15] that came and dragged you out of sin the
[59:17] work that preserves you every day it's
[59:19] the work of God that's in the
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:23] work it says Christian don't you see you
[59:27] are living under your
[59:29] privilege you don't know who you
[59:35] are we don't understand that it's a
[59:37] finished work we we don't understand
[59:40] when we come to this word we we are not
[59:43] and I like the word that our pastor
[59:45] using to discover what we are what's
[59:48] happening in our lives is we are trying
[59:51] to come into the realization because God
[59:54] promised to do something but we don't
[59:56] know by which way he's going to do it we
[59:59] know he promised the end we know what
[1:00:01] the end is going to be but he chooses
[1:00:03] the path by which he's going to get you
[1:00:06] I was thinking as I was translating for
[1:00:07] brother Paul here he is he's talking
[1:00:09] about this woman who came and and out of
[1:00:12] the middle of nowhere she came and and
[1:00:14] Jesus being sitting there with the dirty
[1:00:16] feet and nobody's taking care of him I
[1:00:19] I've always thought about that woman as
[1:00:21] a predestinated woman that God brought
[1:00:24] into existence for that woman one time
[1:00:27] now but for her to get to where Jesus
[1:00:30] was she had to have a way to get there
[1:00:34] so but her life because she was a
[1:00:37] prostit god allowed for her to be a
[1:00:41] prostitute my brother my sister you
[1:00:43] don't know the kind of God we're serving
[1:00:46] he let her be a prostitute for one
[1:00:48] reason he let her be a prostitute just
[1:00:51] so that when Jesus will sit here with
[1:00:53] dirty feet that woman can come Minister
[1:00:56] unto
[1:01:00] her but yet we get caught up by which
[1:01:03] way we came in oh we we we look at each
[1:01:06] other by the way we came in the way you
[1:01:08] came in doesn't matter what matter is
[1:01:11] what God did for
[1:01:14] you it didn't matter whether you were a
[1:01:17] drunker whether you were a prostitute
[1:01:19] whether you were a robber whatever you
[1:01:21] did that doesn't matter that's just the
[1:01:24] way that God was trying to bring you in
[1:01:26] by but once it's done bringing you you
[1:01:28] are a perfect
[1:01:32] son you know different from one that
[1:01:35] never seen the day in their
[1:01:38] life that's the message of the
[1:01:41] hour so you don't judge a person because
[1:01:44] they were drunker because they they
[1:01:46] smoke drugs or because of the past life
[1:01:49] you judge a person by what God
[1:01:51] predestinated him to be
[1:02:00] let me get to my subject
[1:02:03] now oh man eternity is all around
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:09] us so we read this and but Matthew read
[1:02:14] it this morning that quote that we read
[1:02:16] last time about the Invincible Army it
[1:02:18] says now remember Christ in the church
[1:02:20] is a continuation of book of Act and the
[1:02:22] Book of Revelation showed us uh that
[1:02:25] that the Christ spirit will come into
[1:02:27] the church and defiles it defile it it
[1:02:30] said making it lukewarm formal and
[1:02:31] Powerless it exposes Satan it says he
[1:02:35] exposes Satan revealing his work attempt
[1:02:39] attempted destruction of the God's
[1:02:41] people and the destruction of God's word
[1:02:43] right down to the time where is cast
[1:02:45] down in a lake of fire it says if fights
[1:02:48] that he cannot stand it he can't he
[1:02:51] knows that if the people gets the true
[1:02:54] revelation of the true church and and
[1:02:56] what she
[1:02:57] is and what she stand for and that she
[1:03:01] can do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:03:03] invincible Army now we we said this and
[1:03:06] I I would just want to before I can uh
[1:03:08] uh not going to be too long just be
[1:03:11] patient with me for a little bit so it
[1:03:14] was that we said the importance but will
[1:03:16] say the importance of Revelation can not
[1:03:18] never be overemphasized so we cannot
[1:03:20] talk enough about Revelation because God
[1:03:22] deals with us by Revelation so you
[1:03:25] didn't come to the message because you
[1:03:27] compare the message and the Bible and
[1:03:29] you find out that everything was lined
[1:03:31] up then you say well I'll believe this
[1:03:32] message because it's the closest thing
[1:03:34] to the Bible no that's not how you came
[1:03:36] in when the word was preached to you
[1:03:39] something struck your heart Revelation
[1:03:41] came to you revelation God revealed it
[1:03:44] to you before you can even know where he
[1:03:46] was so that's how we come in so that's
[1:03:49] the way and that's the way God wants to
[1:03:51] walk with us every step of the way so
[1:03:54] that's why it's not revelation that
[1:03:56] knowledge no it's Revelation by
[1:03:58] Revelation by Revelation it's God
[1:04:00] continually revealing himself to us so
[1:04:03] if you find yourself falling short of
[1:04:06] something what you need is the revealing
[1:04:08] of the part that God needs to Quicken so
[1:04:11] you can overcome it so you don't need to
[1:04:13] go and educate yourself and find 10 step
[1:04:16] to do this or 20 step to do that what
[1:04:18] you need is the quickening power by
[1:04:21] Revelation to Quicken you so you can
[1:04:23] overcome why because when God makes his
[1:04:26] word a reality there's not enough devil
[1:04:28] that can stop it when God touches the
[1:04:31] hearts of a man a man can stand against
[1:04:34] an army like Moses who would with all
[1:04:37] the education that he had he would by
[1:04:40] Revelation turn around and come against
[1:04:43] the greatest army that there was on
[1:04:45] Earth and look like a fool but why was
[1:04:47] he doing that it was by Revelation why
[1:04:50] because something struck his heart he
[1:04:53] met the pill of fire himself so there
[1:04:55] nothing that you could have tell him to
[1:04:57] stop
[1:05:00] him the reason we are defeated is
[1:05:03] because we go by knowledge by our own
[1:05:05] understanding but let God reveal it to
[1:05:08] you I tell you there's not enough
[1:05:10] proposition I can s in front of
[1:05:12] [Applause]
[1:05:16] you I told Brother Gary I was not going
[1:05:18] to scream but I am I told him I was
[1:05:21] going to try to be cool as a cat but I'm
[1:05:24] losing it already
[1:05:27] so that's why we pray for Revelation and
[1:05:31] it's God adding to our revelation God
[1:05:33] adding when the our Perfection is moving
[1:05:37] into the Revelation it's not moving into
[1:05:39] knowledge by Revelation so when we read
[1:05:42] we we pray that's why we we don't read
[1:05:45] even as to just gain knowledge our
[1:05:48] reading is in prayer so it could be
[1:05:51] Quicken so it could be something that
[1:05:53] could be useful to us if it's by
[1:05:55] knowledge when when tragedy or when
[1:05:58] something Struck it will forget
[1:06:02] it you you'll forget it but if it's by
[1:06:05] Revelation it will strike something and
[1:06:08] something will speak
[1:06:12] back let me move on the scripture tells
[1:06:15] us that men of old they were moved by
[1:06:18] the Revelation the scripture says they
[1:06:20] were moved by the spirit of God and they
[1:06:23] moved by the spirit of God they spoke
[1:06:25] things they didn't have
[1:06:28] understanding they they they spoke it
[1:06:30] says says if they knew what they were
[1:06:32] talking about they would have never said
[1:06:34] it but what was it it was God by
[1:06:37] Revelation moving inside of them Against
[1:06:41] All Odds Against her understanding
[1:06:43] because they were moved by the spirit of
[1:06:45] God they spoke it
[1:06:48] anyhow the man if you go read Hebrews 11
[1:06:52] it was a revealed people that God
[1:06:54] revealed himself to them and they were
[1:06:56] willing to stake their lives why because
[1:06:59] it was about
[1:07:03] Revelation so let me say this and I want
[1:07:06] to say this so it's by Revelation that
[1:07:10] this word has been given to us and when
[1:07:12] we have that understanding that what
[1:07:15] Satan is trying to do to the church
[1:07:17] therefore by the same Revelation that we
[1:07:20] understand what the devil is trying to
[1:07:21] do it gives us the power to withstand
[1:07:24] what the enemy is trying to do
[1:07:26] do I'll tell you this you can know what
[1:07:30] the enemy is trying to do if you don't
[1:07:32] have Revelation he's still going to do
[1:07:37] it because there's no nothing that can
[1:07:39] stand against it that's but if you know
[1:07:42] it by Revelation when it comes you can
[1:07:45] stand and fight against it why because
[1:07:47] you have been now empowered by the word
[1:07:50] of God you have known your position and
[1:07:53] you've known what God Revelation is good
[1:07:55] God giving to a Believer part of himself
[1:07:59] for him to stand there and speak the
[1:08:00] word and know that God will back his
[1:08:02] word
[1:08:06] out that's why could
[1:08:09] say if God told me that they will raise
[1:08:12] is it George
[1:08:13] Washington that I'll tell the whole
[1:08:15] world really I mean could you not let it
[1:08:19] reason a little bit no if it was by
[1:08:22] Revelation it was revealed to me that
[1:08:24] God will do that I'll stand up and say
[1:08:26] it why because I know I'm not speaking
[1:08:29] my own word I'm speaking his word and
[1:08:31] when I speak his word he will stand upon
[1:08:33] his one
[1:08:36] word so he knows he knows that if people
[1:08:40] get the true revelation of the true
[1:08:42] church and what she is and what you
[1:08:44] stand for that she can do the Greater
[1:08:46] Works she shall be an invincible Army
[1:08:49] and if we get the true revelation of the
[1:08:50] true Spirit within the framework of the
[1:08:52] Church of the Christian church and by
[1:08:55] God's Spirit discern and withstand the
[1:08:57] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:08:59] powerless before
[1:09:03] her and I want to say
[1:09:05] this we can certainly say by the
[1:09:09] revealed word of God that we have
[1:09:11] receive we can certainly declare that
[1:09:14] tonight we have received the true
[1:09:16] revelation of what the true church is
[1:09:18] amen amen it's not a mystery
[1:09:22] amen amen it's not a mystery the true
[1:09:26] church is Christ's Bride for the end
[1:09:28] time the true church is Christ himself
[1:09:31] in the form of his own bride the true
[1:09:34] church is God let me just say this is
[1:09:38] The God Who overcame the devil in heaven
[1:09:42] The God Who overcame the devil in the
[1:09:44] body of Jesus Christ that's him God
[1:09:47] wants to overcome the devil in your
[1:09:51] flesh it's not your battle it's him he
[1:09:55] wants to overcome he wants to defeat the
[1:09:58] Devil in every form that he can find
[1:10:03] himself that's the True Church the true
[1:10:06] church is a called out people separated
[1:10:09] people that the word of God has called
[1:10:11] out of the world and out of denomination
[1:10:14] what God himself is revealed himself to
[1:10:16] that's why denomination can never
[1:10:18] produce it why because it's just the
[1:10:20] teaching and the knowledge and intellect
[1:10:22] being
[1:10:23] imparted but never coming into the
[1:10:25] realization of what God is trying to
[1:10:31] achieve but whatam says now Satan will
[1:10:36] constantly punch at you until you are
[1:10:38] finished here on Earth just remember
[1:10:41] that you will never have a time but what
[1:10:44] which your punch there will be punch
[1:10:46] going on because you are in the battle
[1:10:49] did you ask to come to Christ uh to go
[1:10:51] into a picnic he says well you are sure
[1:10:54] going to be Sur surpris because it's
[1:10:56] it's a constant battle it says you've
[1:10:59] been uh I've been in the field for 31
[1:11:01] years I fought every inch of the way
[1:11:04] that's right Israel had to fight every
[1:11:07] inch of the way the uh it says the
[1:11:09] Palestine was given to them but they had
[1:11:12] to fight every inch of the way to get
[1:11:19] it now let me say
[1:11:22] this Satan is always there
[1:11:25] to challenge every promise we claim we
[1:11:28] have
[1:11:30] that's you just open your mouth and say
[1:11:33] thank God I got the Holy Spirit oh my
[1:11:40] goodness I mean you were fine until you
[1:11:43] declared
[1:11:45] it the moment you declare it he's going
[1:11:48] to uncover every Rock anything to show
[1:11:52] you you don't have you know the moment
[1:11:54] to bet comes in your mind you see I told
[1:11:57] you you didn't have it the moment you
[1:12:00] commit a mistake oh you see and you
[1:12:02] claim to have the Holy Spirit the moment
[1:12:05] why because that's that's who he is he's
[1:12:07] the accuser so he's the opposer of the
[1:12:11] Revelation he knows that if you believe
[1:12:14] by Revelation you will overcome him so
[1:12:17] his job is to torment you his job is to
[1:12:20] continually fight against that so you
[1:12:23] never come to the full understanding so
[1:12:25] you just say oh praise God I'm Healed oh
[1:12:29] goodness there he goes and buckets of
[1:12:32] symptoms starts to pour in oh you said
[1:12:35] you were healed didn't you oh what is
[1:12:37] that back pain coming from oh maybe it
[1:12:40] was that surgery that didn't go well
[1:12:42] maybe it was what you testified about
[1:12:44] and now you got to go now you are a liar
[1:12:46] you got to go and correct it no I'm not
[1:12:49] correcting
[1:12:53] it praise the Lord if God told me I'm
[1:12:55] Healed I'm Healed it doesn't matter how
[1:12:58] many symptoms still
[1:13:01] around if God told me I'm safe and I was
[1:13:04] dipp in the Muk it doesn't
[1:13:08] matter if he reveal it to me he that
[1:13:11] reveal it to me will take me out of the
[1:13:13] m and will testify of his own
[1:13:18] word the problem is we put ourselves
[1:13:21] inside of it we place ourselves between
[1:13:24] God God and Satan we're trying to help
[1:13:27] God prove his word no God proves his own
[1:13:31] word in fact let me just jump to the end
[1:13:34] butam says God will have to create a
[1:13:38] situation that looks impossible for him
[1:13:41] to prove his word otherwise if it's just
[1:13:44] a small situation then how do we know
[1:13:46] he's proving his word no he will have to
[1:13:48] take like a Noah and there's never been
[1:13:51] a rain before there's never been a drop
[1:13:54] of rain before
[1:13:55] it will call him in and say it's going
[1:13:57] to rain so everybody can look at him and
[1:14:00] say you are
[1:14:03] crazy and God will say Come On Son I
[1:14:07] know there's always going to be every
[1:14:09] time you stand on the word there's
[1:14:11] always going to be things that you're
[1:14:12] going to have there's always going to be
[1:14:14] challenges you're going to have to
[1:14:15] overcome every time there's always going
[1:14:18] to be a ridicule that's going to come
[1:14:20] let me say this anybody that's ever
[1:14:22] stood upon the word you're going to have
[1:14:24] to endure
[1:14:27] ridicule you going into the
[1:14:29] Rapture Rapture somebody will have to
[1:14:33] ridicu that so people will ridicule and
[1:14:36] Noah will just be there and building his
[1:14:38] boat in fact his boat is been built away
[1:14:42] from where the water
[1:14:45] is so how are we going to pick up this
[1:14:48] boat and take it to the water who's
[1:14:51] going to help you because everybody's
[1:14:53] laughing at you right
[1:14:55] but God knew he said come on on son just
[1:14:58] build a boat I told you to build a boat
[1:15:01] don't worry about it just build it and
[1:15:03] Noah will just go day in and day out and
[1:15:05] just build his boat and oh my goodness
[1:15:08] he became the laugh of this the the city
[1:15:11] and the laugh of the town and everything
[1:15:13] oh but that old man that's building a
[1:15:15] boat yeah go over there you know if you
[1:15:17] go there you make a right thing you get
[1:15:19] to work he became the reference of the
[1:15:22] city oh but one day
[1:15:25] one day God told him son it's time get
[1:15:29] into the boat he got into the boat he
[1:15:33] closed the door and let me say this
[1:15:36] perhaps there were those that were
[1:15:37] hanging around trying to figure out is
[1:15:40] this man really crazy or may he be right
[1:15:43] so let's just hang around and find out
[1:15:44] what's happened they waited and waited
[1:15:47] nothing happened they made the decision
[1:15:50] and say that truly this man is Crazy by
[1:15:53] the time they made that rank him down
[1:15:56] why because God will prove his word with
[1:15:59] the
[1:16:01] Believers what one I'm says God is
[1:16:04] looking for one man one man one person
[1:16:08] it it doesn't take all of us just one of
[1:16:10] us one of us in the presence of God say
[1:16:13] I believe your word that's
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:21] enough one
[1:16:23] person by that living children God will
[1:16:27] come and say ah now it's
[1:16:30] time but when I'm says when
[1:16:33] Joshua when they came and they were told
[1:16:35] to go and cross Jordan it says it looked
[1:16:40] like it was crazy because God chose the
[1:16:43] time where Jordan is actually
[1:16:49] flooded if they had waited just couple
[1:16:52] of months or if they had just gone
[1:16:56] before they were going to cross on
[1:16:59] foot so somebody lost their
[1:17:05] mind they showed up at the
[1:17:07] river
[1:17:09] like and now I'm thinking about all the
[1:17:11] people that were there of course in a
[1:17:13] crowd there's always Believers
[1:17:15] unbeliever make Believers oh they always
[1:17:17] part of the crowd you will never miss
[1:17:19] them they're like what did you say
[1:17:22] again they like well they said we're
[1:17:24] going to
[1:17:25] what what month is it again he said
[1:17:27] April yeah did you did you guys know
[1:17:30] that there's going to be snow that's
[1:17:31] going to melt like well we don't know I
[1:17:33] mean you know he's the leader I mean he
[1:17:35] told he told us to come we just come in
[1:17:37] like
[1:17:39] well who who told who told him to come
[1:17:41] in
[1:17:42] here it's like so what what do we do
[1:17:47] now now I'm talking about Joshua we do
[1:17:50] that all the time with our own
[1:17:53] self God told told you you are healed
[1:17:56] and you begin to question was that
[1:17:58] really healed I mean is that really I
[1:18:01] mean maybe oh God told me I'm he maybe I
[1:18:03] need to go down so they can pray for me
[1:18:05] the second time but why don't you pray
[1:18:06] for me again well you know you believe
[1:18:09] God yeah you are healed just go on he
[1:18:11] said well no maybe the third time you
[1:18:13] know God is perfect in three you know

[1:18:19] on let's
[1:18:21] go we do that all the time
[1:18:25] A promise is given to you it's not your
[1:18:29] business to stand and manifest a promise

[1:18:35] go and defend the promise your pro your
[1:18:38] promise or your place is to believe the
[1:18:41] promise your place is to confess the
[1:18:44] promise your promise however crazy let
[1:18:47] me say this don't mind looking crazy in
[1:18:49] front of people don't mind that because
[1:18:53] the same God he's going to come and

[1:20:05] Sons I don't want Darkness to come I got
[1:20:08] to finish up my enemies well science
[1:20:12] says it's actually the Earth that grows
[1:20:15] around the Sun you know that's why we
[1:20:17] all be taught but I can this man ask and
[1:20:21] say son stand still
[1:20:28] which geography book did he
[1:20:34] read where did he get his reference
[1:20:38] from but the crazy thing is it happens
[1:20:42] why because when he s there what he
[1:20:44] spoke he spoke the word of Mighty God he
[1:20:48] asked for God and God came and
[1:20:50] Vindicated his word let me say this
[1:20:53] don't mind looking crazy you just have
[1:20:55] to believe what God Said God is the
[1:20:58] owner of the word and he's the one who's
[1:21:01] responsible to bringing it to
[1:21:05] pass don't take responsibilities that
[1:21:08] don't belong to
[1:21:12] you we take responsibilities that don't
[1:21:15] belong to us did God said you're going
[1:21:17] to prove his word no he said he will
[1:21:19] prove his word by
[1:21:22] you in fact the prophet said the prophet
[1:21:25] said God will predestinate a
[1:21:29] Believer someone by which he can bring
[1:21:31] his word to come to pass someone who's
[1:21:34] happy enough to believe the crazy
[1:21:36] someone like John Ryan oh praise God I'm
[1:21:40] heal John Ryan come on man you come here
[1:21:45] I cut your hair but why don't you just
[1:21:47] shut up because you making yourself look
[1:21:50] crazy right now because you're not heal
[1:21:52] you still blind it says extra extra I'm
[1:21:55] Healed extra extra I'm Healed they're
[1:21:58] like well okay since you don't want to
[1:22:00] listen we'll just make you the the the
[1:22:03] the the but of all jokes so come over
[1:22:05] here and says hey hey have you heard
[1:22:07] that man in my barber shop he says okay
[1:22:09] come he says JN Ryan can you say again
[1:22:11] what did you say he says well he says
[1:22:14] what happened he says well I went to
[1:22:15] that church over the other day they
[1:22:17] prayed for me and and praise God I'm
[1:22:19] here and as he was just about to laugh
[1:22:22] at him his eyes came open
[1:22:25] what was it God God proving his word how
[1:22:31] however crazy he was it didn't matter
[1:22:34] there was a God by which let me say this
[1:22:36] let's be crazy for
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:42] god let's be fools for god let's be
[1:22:46] crazy for him because he's the only one
[1:22:49] who can vindicate our craziness
[1:22:56] others will reject you with your
[1:22:57] craziness but he will come and take your
[1:23:00] craziness and break it a
[1:23:05] reality he's proving his word by his
[1:23:09] believing children what is he doing he's
[1:23:12] making them an invincible army yes they
[1:23:14] stood there and because why he's trying
[1:23:17] to prove to you and I that it's never
[1:23:20] about a man it's always about the word
[1:23:22] it's never about who it is it's just a
[1:23:25] believing child it doesn't matter how
[1:23:28] difficult the circumstance look in fact
[1:23:30] God wants the circumstance to be
[1:23:35] impossible because if it's somewhat then
[1:23:38] we'll get confused who did it he wants
[1:23:41] it to be absolutely
[1:23:45] impossible he waited until Abraham could
[1:23:48] not have a child he waited until Sarah's
[1:23:51] womb was dead
[1:23:55] he waited until Lazarus was completely
[1:23:58] dead not just dead but he's not
[1:24:02] sunk and when the noi showed up you're
[1:24:06] like oh if you just came two days
[1:24:09] earlier if you just came before I know
[1:24:13] if when you came if if you came when he
[1:24:15] was sick I've seen you heal the Dead the
[1:24:18] sick on we said well how about when he's
[1:24:21] dead he says well I I know at least that
[1:24:24] I've seen you raise the dead too but I
[1:24:26] never seen you raise the dead who's been
[1:24:28] buried and whose nose is sunk he says
[1:24:31] well I am the resurrection and the life
[1:24:34] why he was there to vindicate his word
[1:24:37] he said Lazarus s and Lazarus was not
[1:24:40] dead so therefore when he shows up he's
[1:24:42] able to bring him out of the
[1:24:46] death but whatam
[1:24:48] says death knew its Master that's right
[1:24:52] and the Soul knew its creator when he
[1:24:55] spoke that voice yes Lazarus came for
[1:24:59] what was he God proving his word showing
[1:25:02] his children hang on to the word never
[1:25:06] get tired of it I don't care how much
[1:25:08] fun people make of you you stand on the
[1:25:11] word at the end you will be the one
[1:25:14] laughing God bless you if the musician
[1:25:17] can come
[1:25:35] he's going to prove Rapture by you and
[1:25:38] that's a promise that is given you say

[1:25:44] don't worry about it you just continue
[1:25:46] to discover his word let this word work
[1:25:49] on you let this word work on you at the
[1:25:51] end when Rapture will come you'll find
[1:25:53] yourself on the other side you say how
[1:25:56] did I make it you made it because he's
[1:25:58] proving his word you didn't make it
[1:26:01] because you had the best left there is
[1:26:03] no you making it because he said you'll
[1:26:05] be
