[22:16] amen
[22:19] [Music]
[22:25] i'm gonna do something a little
[22:26] different
[22:28] i haven't really played guitar in like
[22:30] seven years
[22:32] but i told the lord this morning that if
[22:35] brother billy had me come up and sing i
[22:36] was gonna do this
[22:40] you know i don't know if many of you
[22:41] know but about seven years ago within a
[22:43] couple weeks after i proposed to
[22:44] my wife i was at work i worked in a
[22:48] place that uh built concrete conforms
[22:52] that hold concrete
[22:54] like for construction concrete forms and
[22:55] they're metal
[22:57] so there's a lot of metal going around
[22:58] they're not the wooden ones they do the
[22:59] heavy industrial ones for bridges and
[23:01] things and
[23:02] i was walking through an area and
[23:06] a guy who had overhead crane with a
[23:08] piece of the metal on it
[23:09] and uh they held it in suction cups so
[23:11] it went sideways
[23:13] and it was so it was really thin maybe
[23:15] about an eighth inch thick and i was
[23:16] walking through an area and the guy had
[23:18] the
[23:18] piece of the overhead crane and he
[23:20] stopped the crane
[23:21] and i was trying to go to the restroom
[23:23] and so i walked across the area we both
[23:25] stopped
[23:26] initially and i thought he was going to
[23:27] let me go and as soon as i started
[23:28] walking he moved the crane
[23:30] and i was walking through i didn't have
[23:33] anywhere really to go
[23:34] there's a big stack of metal behind me
[23:36] and he stopped the crane
[23:38] but obviously the momentum carried it
[23:40] and instinctively i just put my hands
[23:42] out and it was the grace of god i was
[23:43] actually thinking about it this morning
[23:44] my brother david was preaching
[23:46] about how the lord keeps you and
[23:49] different things like that and i think
[23:50] you know i was thinking about i was like
[23:51] you know
[23:52] had i not hit my hand that thing
[23:54] probably would have chopped my head off
[23:56] because it was right at neck level
[23:58] so i have no doubt that the devil was
[23:59] trying to kill me that day but i put my
[24:01] hand out
[24:02] and my right hand kind of pushed it and
[24:03] it kind of pivoted and
[24:05] kind of guillotined my left hand against
[24:07] it and just
[24:08] hit it and it sliced it all the way down
[24:10] to the bone
[24:11] and uh cut all the nerves and the
[24:13] ligaments and everything in there and my
[24:14] hand was just flopping around
[24:16] and uh you know i tell you
[24:19] i just kind of feel inspired to say this
[24:20] but i told the lord
[24:22] you know i know i know it was the lord
[24:24] that was with me because
[24:26] my first instinct was i screamed in pain
[24:29] because it was
[24:29] really painful but the second thing that
[24:31] happened was i just knelt down i started
[24:32] praying
[24:33] and i remember the only thing i really
[24:35] remember specifically about the whole
[24:37] situation was i just got down before the
[24:38] lord i said lord
[24:39] i said lord i have no idea why this
[24:41] happened because i knew i knew it was
[24:42] bad
[24:43] i never looked at it by the grace of the
[24:45] lord because i knew if i did it was
[24:46] going to be even worse
[24:47] it was good you know it's one of those
[24:48] things where you scrape your knee it
[24:50] doesn't really feel bad till you look at
[24:51] it
[24:52] and so i never looked at it but i said
[24:53] lord i said i know this is really bad i
[24:55] said but lord if
[24:56] and i don't know why it happened but if
[24:58] this is part of what it takes
[25:00] to help me get to a rapture then lord
[25:01] give me the strength to endure it
[25:03] and i know that was the lord because i
[25:05] know that's not a normal human reaction
[25:06] to something like that
[25:07] but you know i i had basically lost
[25:10] feeling in my hand and i have a little
[25:11] bit of it back by the grace of god but
[25:13] i've i've had a dream and i had a
[25:16] brother in ohio that had a dream that i
[25:17] had i
[25:18] was completely healed and i know my
[25:19] healing was done and i just told the
[25:22] lord i said you know what i'm so tired
[25:23] of sitting there and letting the devil
[25:25] have any kind of victory
[25:27] and then the even and so i'm going to
[25:28] play i'm going to pl i haven't played in
[25:30] a long time and it may not sound
[25:32] amazing but we're going to try and i
[25:35] i felt encouraged because brother david
[25:37] said you know even if you can't
[25:39] do something you you do a special anyway
[25:42] so i'm going to do this anyhow
[25:44] just in the face of the devil at the
[25:45] very least and uh you know why because
[25:48] my healing's already done
[25:50] it's just sometimes the flesh likes to
[25:52] lag behind and manifesting so
[25:53] but we know the flesh is enmity with
[25:55] with the devil so we're gonna
[25:57] sing this song and you just pray for me
[26:00] and i'm gonna do the best i can so
[26:18] [Music]

[41:49] and uh so we're just trusting the lord
[41:51] will be
[41:52] uh with us this evening um
[41:56] i'd like to uh just fellowship a little
[41:59] bit
[42:00] uh with you and we're going to read uh
[42:03] several scriptures and everything but
[42:06] i'd like to if i wanted to have a title
[42:09] i would like to preach on
[42:12] front line workers front front line
[42:16] workers and just
[42:19] kind of a thought and you know as we
[42:22] listened to
[42:23] this morning i had left my book
[42:26] back in my office but i wanted to read
[42:28] that statement i'll just
[42:30] quote it to you brother branham talked
[42:32] about david
[42:33] being a good shepherd running to
[42:36] snatch the the sheep
[42:39] out from the bear and from the lion and
[42:42] he said any good shepherd
[42:44] wants to do that uh he wants to uh
[42:48] keep the enemy away from
[42:51] the sheep and you you know even as a
[42:54] pastor a lot of times you go through a
[42:56] lot of personal
[42:57] trials i mean you know the deputy i
[43:00] believe in the devil i i hate to say
[43:02] that but you know some people say i
[43:03] don't believe in the devil well then
[43:05] you're you're not very bright the
[43:08] devil's real
[43:09] and he fights in fact the bible said
[43:12] he's like a roaring lion
[43:14] going about seeking whom he may devour
[43:17] so naturally if you're you're given
[43:21] to watch out over the flock then uh
[43:26] you know you got to know that he's out
[43:28] there and and
[43:29] and so he said now he said that that
[43:32] that that's as he brought the story he
[43:36] said
[43:37] that's what we're here to do tonight he
[43:40] says the enemies come in like a lion
[43:43] and and it has grabbed the sheep it may
[43:45] be your
[43:46] a friend it may be a loved one it may be
[43:48] somebody in school
[43:49] it may be somebody you know who's got
[43:51] sick
[43:52] it may be somebody who somebody told
[43:54] them a lie and
[43:56] and they've got a different attitude we
[43:58] don't care
[43:59] what the circumstances is we don't care
[44:02] in what form that the lion has come
[44:06] we don't care in what form the bearer
[44:08] has come
[44:09] but there's something in us that that
[44:12] we we go out and we we want to
[44:16] deliver that uh person from that enemy
[44:19] now you know we don't know david may
[44:22] may have been us suffering uh
[44:25] you know that morning he might have been
[44:27] laying there with covert 15.
[44:30] yeah you know he might have been a
[44:33] sicker and a hound dog
[44:34] you know what i mean and and he could
[44:37] barely get up
[44:39] you know what i mean but it didn't
[44:40] matter you understand when the call of
[44:42] duty came
[44:44] he rose to the occasion and so
[44:47] when you look at that story david
[44:51] was a front line worker he was right on
[44:54] the front line he was meeting the enemy
[44:58] on the front line you know what i mean
[45:00] he wasn't
[45:02] he he you know he had the support of his
[45:05] father and his brothers
[45:07] they may have sent them out food but and
[45:10] that's all good we believe in the
[45:12] support
[45:12] but also the uh there has to be
[45:15] frontline workers there have to be
[45:17] people that
[45:18] meet the devil uh face to face
[45:21] as uh straight on and and so we locked
[45:25] and he said so that's the
[45:26] the spirit of it is that that we want to
[45:30] be that we
[45:31] want and so when you take that that
[45:34] farther you know so many times we just
[45:37] put
[45:37] uh like a pastor we we put him in an
[45:41] office and then he's attributed
[45:44] to do all these things you know he's
[45:47] attributed
[45:48] to pray for the sick and he's attributed
[45:51] to
[45:52] to uh counsel and he's a tribute and all
[45:55] these things are
[45:56] are listed for the pastor to do but you
[46:00] can't find that anywhere in the
[46:01] scripture that he takes
[46:04] over all those things amen the
[46:06] commission
[46:07] was not to pastors
[46:11] it didn't say i send the pastors
[46:14] in all the world to preach the gospel i
[46:17] send pastors to lay hands on the sick i
[46:21] i said this he says no i send you
[46:24] into all the world to lay hands on the
[46:27] set
[46:27] someone asked me can a sister lay hands
[46:30] on the sick and pray for somebody
[46:32] most certainly i i i'll guarantee you
[46:36] there's a lot of sisters that i'd rather
[46:38] have pray for me
[46:39] than some of the brothers i've known
[46:40] through my lifetime
[46:42] you know what i mean i mean they're that
[46:45] just the way that that uh
[46:48] it is so no uh that's uh
[46:53] uh and you talk about testifying
[46:56] now there's certain doctrines that a a
[47:00] sister might not
[47:01] handle uh because she's not meant to
[47:04] handle the word of god
[47:06] but testifying is a lot different than
[47:08] teaching
[47:10] you know what i mean telling people what
[47:12] what kind of god you have
[47:14] what kind of gods you serve the things
[47:16] that god has done
[47:18] you know if someone maybe asked you to
[47:20] explain
[47:21] the godhead you might say you know it's
[47:23] not given to me to
[47:25] explain uh the godhead but you know i
[47:28] can get one of my
[47:29] my husband to do that or i can get my
[47:32] uh a brother to do that one of the
[47:35] deacons or maybe a brother you have
[47:37] confidence in
[47:38] not everything comes back to the pastor
[47:42] because believe it or not you know the
[47:45] prophet of god said a pastor's
[47:47] attitude is is that he pastors the whole
[47:50] city
[47:51] so as far as i'm concerned i've got
[47:53] seven million people
[47:55] in my congregation i can't do it all
[47:58] you know what i'm saying i can't reach
[48:00] out to seven million people i can't lay
[48:02] my hands on the sick when seven million
[48:04] people
[48:05] i can't testify to seven
[48:08] million people if you know what i'm
[48:10] saying so
[48:11] what we need is those we need frontline
[48:13] workers
[48:15] amen we need people who will be on the
[48:17] front line who will meet the challenge
[48:20] uh who who will be there to to to be in
[48:23] service and so
[48:24] i i just uh that's kind of uh what my
[48:27] little
[48:28] thought is tonight and and uh
[48:32] and we're appreciative of that and so uh
[48:35] we we never want to discount ourselves
[48:38] that's what we're called to do
[48:40] we are fighting an adversary we have an
[48:43] enemy amen we want to put on the full
[48:46] armor of god
[48:47] we want to be ready we want to have the
[48:50] helmet of salvation we want the
[48:52] breastplate of the faith we want the
[48:54] sword of the word of god
[48:56] we want to be there to be
[48:59] ready for duty we want to be a
[49:02] front-line worker
[49:03] and believe it or not there's people
[49:06] that
[49:07] that only you can touch
[49:11] i've seen it many times i've just seen
[49:14] it just seems like sometimes i'll come
[49:16] across in my
[49:17] own life and i'll meet somebody and i'll
[49:20] tell you we just hit it off
[49:22] you know i talked with a fellow the
[49:24] other day
[49:26] mr henry david henry is a good man and
[49:30] and i i got the fellowship and with him
[49:32] we're trying to look at maybe doing some
[49:34] paving and
[49:35] helping us fix a little bit in the lot
[49:37] and do a little things for us and
[49:40] and we've got the fellowship and we got
[49:42] to talk and
[49:43] and uh got to testifying how that you
[49:46] know i got converted and it wasn't long
[49:48] he reached
[49:49] his pocket and said you know god's just
[49:50] started working in my life
[49:52] a year ago and and i i just got my
[49:55] sober for one year uh badge and and
[49:59] and it was it was just a wonderful bond
[50:02] it was just like wow this guy's like a
[50:04] buddy
[50:06] you know what i mean i don't know if
[50:07] it'll go anywhere from there
[50:09] if there's a seed there i know it'll go
[50:12] somewhere you know what i mean
[50:13] but it was wonderful fellowshipping with
[50:16] them talking with them and
[50:18] and and and just sharing and i gave them
[50:21] the healing thoughts book
[50:22] and and just it just something sometimes
[50:26] you have that bond and you know god made
[50:29] that
[50:30] you understand that and and there's
[50:32] people that you'll bond with that you
[50:34] can contact that nobody else can ever
[50:36] contact that
[50:37] nobody else will ever have a feel for
[50:40] and
[50:40] and anybody that says that that you know
[50:43] that's what satan does he always tries
[50:45] to push everybody down a rabbit hole
[50:47] you know what i mean if he always tries
[50:49] to make you feel that there's nobody you
[50:50] can talk to you're all
[50:52] insignificant nobody will listen to you
[50:55] i'll tell you if there was a fire and
[50:58] you were the person to cry fire
[51:00] everybody would listen to you
[51:04] just think of it well there is a fire
[51:07] coming
[51:09] a real bad one a consuming fire
[51:13] amen if it's this
[51:16] world is on fire right now
[51:20] amen the the burning flames
[51:23] of sin are consuming people the lies are
[51:27] are affecting their hearts and and their
[51:30] minds it
[51:31] uh it it's a it's a time like uh
[51:35] like you you can imagine and
[51:38] you know when someone's lost
[51:41] they don't care who they get their
[51:43] directions from
[51:45] do you know how i can get out of here
[51:47] yeah
[51:48] you know and and so you you're important
[51:54] you ought you've got to understand
[51:56] you've got qualities god
[51:57] made you he gave you the personality he
[52:00] gave you he gave you the way that you
[52:02] are you don't have to be bright
[52:05] you know what i mean you don't have to
[52:07] be a great intellectual you don't have
[52:08] to have an
[52:10] enticing words you you you
[52:13] you understand if excuse the expression
[52:16] but if you're dumber in the mud fence
[52:18] there's a lot of people out there that
[52:19] are dumber in a mud fence that need
[52:21] testifying too
[52:24] you know believe it or not most of the
[52:25] people out there are dumber in the mud
[52:27] fins
[52:28] because they ain't in the house of god
[52:30] they ain't serving god and that
[52:32] obviously proves to you they're not too
[52:34] bright
[52:35] and then you possess eternal life that
[52:38] makes you a genius
[52:41] you know what i mean so so you
[52:44] you you can talk to them and reach out
[52:46] to them and and
[52:48] and and touch them it can make a a
[52:51] difference
[52:52] and so uh that's what i said like we
[52:55] well we need uh frontline workers
[52:59] in fact it's time we become
[53:03] front line workers amen so i'd just like
[53:06] to
[53:07] read a few scriptures and talk about a
[53:10] few of the front line
[53:11] workers in the bible
[53:14] men that were willing
[53:18] to put themselves in harm's way
[53:23] for the truth and we just got four
[53:26] examples
[53:27] and we i'm sure we could find many more
[53:30] in fact we could go to the fox book of
[53:32] martyrs
[53:33] and read uh testimony after testimony
[53:37] have you have if you haven't read the
[53:39] fox book of martyrs
[53:40] take a little time in your life to sit
[53:43] down if
[53:44] and if you can't read the whole thing go
[53:46] through there and read many
[53:47] several of the testimonies of what
[53:50] people
[53:51] did to stand for this gospel
[53:54] amen you know remember that that
[53:56] horserider went out
[53:58] and it was taking every life and he
[54:01] would have taken all the life of the
[54:03] word of god
[54:04] off the face of the earth that the word
[54:06] spoke hurt not the wine
[54:08] nor the oil so god kept that anointing
[54:11] here so it could go forth and anoint
[54:14] the believers but read that fox book of
[54:16] martyrs
[54:17] and and and lay it down so that's what
[54:20] we're talking about
[54:21] today what what our heart today was is
[54:24] that we've got to be perseverant
[54:26] we can't bail you know what i mean we
[54:30] can't we just can't i i can't believe it
[54:32] like
[54:33] the this virus comes along and and
[54:37] it seems like it provided an excuse
[54:40] for people not to go to church well i
[54:43] can understand staying home
[54:45] i i really can but i can also understand
[54:48] i try to make a service now and then
[54:51] you know what i mean the word of god
[54:53] says forsake yourselves
[54:55] not the assembling of yourselves
[54:57] together
[54:58] so it doesn't say if the president says
[55:01] it's okay
[55:02] or if the governor says it's okay or if
[55:05] this person
[55:06] says it's okay or if there's sickness
[55:10] in the land okay you know what the first
[55:13] church
[55:14] if if they would have had a virus like
[55:17] this
[55:17] in the days of the first church
[55:20] everybody would have had their relatives
[55:21] at church
[55:26] there would have been more virus people
[55:28] there
[55:29] than well people they'd have been
[55:32] everywhere
[55:33] they would've been waiting just to put
[55:35] their put their loved one
[55:37] in the uh shadow of peter
[55:40] they they would have wanted them to lay
[55:42] hands on them anoint them with oil
[55:44] and everything see what happens is
[55:47] because we don't realize
[55:49] how far we have gotten away from
[55:52] the front line how far
[55:55] we have gotten away from where the
[55:58] battle is
[55:59] how far we've gotten away from what our
[56:01] testimony is
[56:03] yeah that's what satan's been doing he's
[56:05] just been moving the needle
[56:07] and moving the needle and moving the
[56:09] needle just pushing us farther away
[56:11] goodness where we won't speak out
[56:14] against homosexuality homosexuality is a
[56:17] demon
[56:18] possession that's all it is
[56:21] it can be cast out of somebody they can
[56:24] be delivered from
[56:26] money it's a filthy lust of a perverted
[56:30] mind
[56:34] oh you can't say that
[56:37] put it up on youtube i don't care
[56:41] it's the devil and you can be free from
[56:44] it
[56:45] someone said would you let a homosexual
[56:47] come to church i'd let them come to
[56:49] church
[56:49] until they heard the gospel and they
[56:52] could no longer practice
[56:54] sit together or to perform any of that
[56:57] things bottom line
[57:00] just how it is it's a spirit it's a
[57:03] devil
[57:04] and it can get off on people
[57:08] you know it is not a way of life and
[57:12] something given by god to control
[57:15] population
[57:16] it's a perverted demonic spirit
[57:19] it's all it is and the gospel has power
[57:23] over those spirits amen you don't have
[57:26] to be
[57:27] politically correct we're so politically
[57:30] correct we don't have anybody on the
[57:31] front line
[57:32] anymore we're so politically
[57:36] correct that we don't have anybody
[57:38] calling out against sin anymore
[57:40] i'll tell you that's one thing i
[57:41] appreciate about this messenger of the
[57:43] hour
[57:44] he stood there and told it the way it is
[57:46] he didn't he called him
[57:48] he called him he said sin was sin and
[57:51] he you know how he spoke about it he
[57:53] know the
[57:54] the the terminologies he used and he was
[57:57] very
[57:58] point blank that there's one thing that
[58:01] stands
[58:01] and it stands alone and god's word
[58:04] stands by itself
[58:05] you don't need me to prop it up it don't
[58:07] need anybody else to prop it up speak it
[58:10] say it just the way that it's written
[58:12] and that's what we need
[58:14] amen in fact we need to find the front
[58:16] line
[58:19] i don't even know if we know where the
[58:20] battlefield is anymore
[58:23] satan's appeared as an angel of light
[58:26] deceiving the very elect if it was
[58:29] possible
[58:30] he's running around there you know
[58:33] taking people's lives
[58:35] dressed up like an angel and if you're
[58:38] not prayed up
[58:39] then you're not ready to be in the
[58:41] battle you're not a front-line worker
[58:44] you're not there in prayer you haven't
[58:46] come to go to work you know these people
[58:50] that come to go to work
[58:54] that help these people that do it they
[58:56] put the mask on they dress
[58:58] up they get in the gloves they're all
[59:00] gowned up
[59:01] and everything in fact when they come in
[59:04] i got
[59:04] i got a test you know where they stick
[59:06] that thing into your brain
[59:08] and uh rattle it around up there for a
[59:11] while
[59:12] and uh it burns and everything when they
[59:15] came into me i thought
[59:16] man i didn't know whether they were
[59:18] afraid i had it or they had it
[59:22] they were dressed for battle you
[59:25] understand they're dressed like front
[59:27] line workers
[59:29] they they have some kind of
[59:30] comprehension in their mind
[59:32] we've had people in our church okay
[59:34] sister walker wonderful woman out there
[59:37] helping those people
[59:38] she had to go through a stint of it
[59:40] we're not immune
[59:43] but we've got something that that's
[59:45] above medicine
[59:47] we've got medicine plus a god that makes
[59:50] it work
[59:50] not only in our bodies but in our minds
[59:53] in our hearts and our souls
[59:55] and our attitudes amen so we've got to
[59:58] be prepared to be front-line workers and
[1:00:00] i'm not talking about
[1:00:02] the virus i'm talking about the sin
[1:00:03] virus
[1:00:05] i'm talking about the enemy meeting the
[1:00:07] enemy i'm talking about
[1:00:09] fighting against the battle we've got to
[1:00:11] know where's the battle
[1:00:13] why it's in school it's with young
[1:00:17] children it's early in life so
[1:00:20] uh so and i just feel that
[1:00:24] it's time that that the scripture says
[1:00:27] when
[1:00:28] satan goes about like a roaring lion
[1:00:31] when the enemy comes in
[1:00:33] like a flood that god raised up a
[1:00:35] standard against it
[1:00:37] amen you say what's the standard in this
[1:00:39] day brother mcgary it's the bride
[1:00:41] of jesus christ it's the called out
[1:00:44] elect lady
[1:00:45] who has received the revealed word of
[1:00:49] god
[1:00:49] for the hour because she's the one
[1:00:51] that's got the answers
[1:00:54] amen they know the deception they they
[1:00:57] know
[1:00:58] it they uh they understand when the
[1:00:59] gospel's watered down
[1:01:01] they understand when it's a social
[1:01:03] gospel well they understand when it's a
[1:01:05] money gospel
[1:01:07] that they know they know that they know
[1:01:09] the truth
[1:01:10] they've got strong meat they they can
[1:01:13] discern between meat
[1:01:15] and milk they can discern between what's
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:18] and what's wrong and they're not worried
[1:01:21] about being political
[1:01:23] correct they're they're they're standing
[1:01:26] there
[1:01:26] they're front-line workers let's just
[1:01:28] take one of them
[1:01:29] for a second just for the uh the
[1:01:32] goodness of the gospel let's turn to
[1:01:34] matthew
[1:01:36] um in in the scriptures matthew
[1:01:39] 3.
[1:01:49] now this is a frontline worker right
[1:01:51] here
[1:01:52] you say what's his name his name's john
[1:01:55] john john of i don't know what his last
[1:01:59] win
[1:01:59] probably is for all i know he's an
[1:02:01] irishman so he was
[1:02:02] might have been john mceary i don't know
[1:02:05] but he could be john you
[1:02:07] tonight right he could
[1:02:10] he he could be any of your your name he
[1:02:12] could he could have been john russ
[1:02:15] it doesn't matter he's a front line
[1:02:17] worker you understand
[1:02:19] that's what he is so so we're putting
[1:02:22] ourselves in the story
[1:02:24] you understand so this is a frontline
[1:02:26] worker we
[1:02:28] we call him john the baptist because
[1:02:30] that's what he was doing but let's just
[1:02:32] read about him he says if
[1:02:33] for in those days king john the baptist
[1:02:37] preaching in the wilderness of judea and
[1:02:40] saying
[1:02:40] repent ye for the kingdom of heaven
[1:02:44] is at hand for
[1:02:47] this is he that was spoken by the
[1:02:50] prophet isaiah
[1:02:51] saying the voice of one crying in the
[1:02:54] wilderness
[1:02:55] prepare ye the way of the lord make his
[1:02:58] path straight you see that man working
[1:03:01] on that front line announcing the coming
[1:03:03] of the lord
[1:03:04] tell them well we know the lord's coming
[1:03:07] we ought to be announcing the coming of
[1:03:09] the lord too
[1:03:10] we've come under the anointing of the
[1:03:14] messenger that was come forth before the
[1:03:17] second coming of the lord
[1:03:21] amen have you come under that anointing
[1:03:23] i hope you felt it
[1:03:25] boy if you've ever got to come under one
[1:03:27] of those anointings of the tape
[1:03:29] and all that word opens up to you man
[1:03:31] it's wonderful
[1:03:33] praise the lord he said
[1:03:36] make this straight and the same john
[1:03:40] had his reignment of camel hair and a
[1:03:43] leather girdeth about his loins and his
[1:03:46] meat
[1:03:46] was locust in wild honey
[1:03:50] and when that when he out
[1:03:53] and they went out to him
[1:03:56] jerusalem and all judea and all the
[1:03:59] regions around
[1:04:00] about jordan and were baptized of him
[1:04:04] in jordan confessing their sins
[1:04:07] and when he saw many of the pharisees
[1:04:11] and the sadducees came to his baptism
[1:04:14] he said unto them o generation of vipers
[1:04:18] who hath warned you to flee from the
[1:04:21] wrath to come
[1:04:23] bring forth therefore fruit meant for
[1:04:26] repentance
[1:04:27] and think ye not saying within
[1:04:29] yourselves
[1:04:30] we have abraham to our father for i say
[1:04:34] unto you that god is able of these
[1:04:36] stones to raise that
[1:04:38] children unto abraham now
[1:04:41] and now also the ax is laid to the root
[1:04:44] of the tree therefore every tree that
[1:04:48] bringeth
[1:04:48] not forth good fruit is hewed down and
[1:04:52] cast into the fire i
[1:04:54] indeed baptize you with water under
[1:04:56] repentance
[1:04:57] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:05:00] than i
[1:05:01] am whose shoes i am not worthy to bear
[1:05:04] for he shall baptize you with the holy
[1:05:07] ghost
[1:05:08] and with fire and whose fan is in his
[1:05:11] hand
[1:05:12] and he will thoroughly purge his floor
[1:05:16] and gather his wheat unto the garner
[1:05:19] but he will burn up the chaff and with
[1:05:22] an
[1:05:23] unquenchable fire
[1:05:26] frontline worker preaching the gospel
[1:05:30] telling it the way it is without fear or
[1:05:33] favor
[1:05:34] he didn't he didn't kind of tiptoe
[1:05:37] around
[1:05:38] oh reverend it's so nice to have you
[1:05:41] here
[1:05:42] today so glad you could visit us
[1:05:46] you know please come sit at this place
[1:05:48] of honor
[1:05:51] he was a front line worker amen he had a
[1:05:54] message
[1:05:56] he had something he believed in he
[1:05:58] wasn't on the front line he wasn't
[1:06:00] he wasn't on the politically correct
[1:06:02] line
[1:06:03] he wasn't on don't offend anybody
[1:06:06] line he was in the battle and those were
[1:06:10] the vipers
[1:06:11] and the snakes that he was fighting
[1:06:13] against he knew that they were the ones
[1:06:15] that were going to crucify him
[1:06:17] he knew that's who he was he wanted to
[1:06:19] point it out
[1:06:21] you know the prophet god said in one
[1:06:22] place he said in the church ages
[1:06:24] he said he said those finals men finally
[1:06:27] stood there
[1:06:28] and they he said he put their they they
[1:06:30] put their finger
[1:06:32] in the face as that of them that claim
[1:06:34] that they were prophets
[1:06:35] and were not and called them out
[1:06:40] you just think of how far we've really
[1:06:42] got away
[1:06:43] from the front line you know but being
[1:06:46] on the front line will cost you
[1:06:48] just go over to saint luke the third
[1:06:58] chapter
[1:07:01] if
[1:07:05] and we can just we can just start maybe
[1:07:07] the 12th verse okay so now he's got
[1:07:09] jews coming to him right but now he says
[1:07:12] then came also
[1:07:13] publicans to be baptized and
[1:07:16] said unto him master what shall we do
[1:07:19] and he said unto them except
[1:07:22] exact no more than that which is
[1:07:25] appointed
[1:07:26] to you and soldiers likewise demanded of
[1:07:30] him saying what shall we do
[1:07:32] and he said unto them do no violence to
[1:07:34] no man
[1:07:36] neither accuse any man falsely but be
[1:07:39] content with your wages
[1:07:42] and as the people were in expectation
[1:07:45] and all men mused in their hearts of
[1:07:48] john
[1:07:49] whether he were the christ or not
[1:07:53] and john answered saying unto them i
[1:07:56] indeed baptize you with water
[1:07:58] that one but one mightier than i cometh
[1:08:02] for the for the
[1:08:05] latches of whose shoes i am not worthy
[1:08:08] to loosen
[1:08:09] and he shall baptize you with the holy
[1:08:12] ghost and fire
[1:08:14] and whose fan is in his hand and he will
[1:08:17] purge this floor
[1:08:19] and with gather the wheat into the
[1:08:20] garner but the chaff he will
[1:08:23] burn with unquenchable fire and many
[1:08:26] other things
[1:08:28] in his exhortation preached to the
[1:08:31] people
[1:08:32] but herod the
[1:08:35] treacher being reproved of him
[1:08:38] for herodius his philips wife
[1:08:42] and for all the evil which herod had
[1:08:44] done
[1:08:45] added yet this above all that he shut up
[1:08:48] john
[1:08:49] in prison so not only was john preaching
[1:08:53] but soldiers started coming to him
[1:08:54] publicans started coming to him
[1:08:56] people started coming to him you see his
[1:08:59] front line expanded
[1:09:02] it expanded from just the jews it
[1:09:04] expanded from just
[1:09:06] those in the region it expanded the
[1:09:08] public concentration have you expanded
[1:09:10] your front line
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:15] you've got a greater message than john
[1:09:17] had
[1:09:18] and there was no man been built on earth
[1:09:22] like john he just spoke it like it is
[1:09:26] what a beautiful
[1:09:27] beautiful story of john and what did he
[1:09:30] do it costed him life
[1:09:33] amen you know the story how herod's wife
[1:09:36] and she
[1:09:37] she didn't like the fact that john
[1:09:39] rebuked it and then she got drunk and
[1:09:41] the king got drunk and
[1:09:42] he asked for john's head being a front
[1:09:45] line word
[1:09:45] cost him but he didn't change the gospel
[1:09:49] for his own life he stood right there
[1:09:52] on the front line and so i feel that's
[1:09:55] what we need to be i
[1:09:56] i'm just talking about front line
[1:09:58] workers every place i go
[1:10:00] i hear the praise for frontline workers
[1:10:02] and i want to join my praise to them
[1:10:05] all of you that have dealt with the sick
[1:10:06] that have had to go to the hospitals
[1:10:08] work in hospitals
[1:10:09] had to come in contact with those people
[1:10:12] to serve them and to help them
[1:10:14] get better yes you need all the respect
[1:10:16] in the world
[1:10:17] but how much more respect does somebody
[1:10:20] who's trying to get somebody's eternal
[1:10:22] soul
[1:10:24] well who won't compromise
[1:10:28] who will say whatever it takes you know
[1:10:31] what i mean won't hold back
[1:10:34] from them yeah and and so
[1:10:37] we're talking about those we want to be
[1:10:39] front-line workers too
[1:10:40] if they have enough courageous to go
[1:10:43] into it
[1:10:44] and and come in contact with something
[1:10:46] that they may
[1:10:47] catch and get sick with how much more
[1:10:50] should we be willing to come in contact
[1:10:52] with a spirit
[1:10:53] come contact with a lying devil to come
[1:10:56] contact with somebody that's
[1:10:58] in possession so that that person could
[1:11:01] be free from that
[1:11:03] amen let's get on the front line amen
[1:11:07] you know the scripture says if you're
[1:11:08] ashamed of me before men
[1:11:11] i'll be ashamed of you before my father
[1:11:13] don't you think you're going to get in
[1:11:15] on your good works

[1:18:48] wonders and miracles stephen was on the
[1:18:50] front line

[1:19:51] possessed the wisdom
[1:19:53] of the message of the hour i've told
[1:19:55] stories that brother branham have told
[1:19:58] i've used the sayings that brother
[1:19:59] branham has used and it confounds
[1:20:02] the wise and he said
[1:20:06] and they were stubborn men and said we
[1:20:09] have heard of
[1:20:10] him speak of blasphemies words
[1:20:13] against moses and against god and they
[1:20:17] stirred up the
[1:20:18] people and the elders and the scribes
[1:20:20] came
[1:20:21] unto him and and caught him
[1:20:24] and brought him to council and and
[1:20:27] set up false witnesses which said this
[1:20:30] man
[1:20:33] ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words
[1:20:37] against the holy place and the law
[1:20:40] and we have heard him say that this
[1:20:44] jesus of nazareth will destroy this
[1:20:46] place
[1:20:47] and shall change the customs which moses
[1:20:51] delivered to us and all that sat in
[1:20:54] counsel

[1:20:58] as it had been the face of an angel
[1:21:02] hallelujah frontline worker

[1:21:07] the front line
[1:21:10] i mean he didn't take an easy way then
[1:21:13] you keep reading the rest of the story
[1:21:16] then then he gets over here and and
[1:21:19] and pretty soon he starts to see the the
[1:21:22] the the power of god and
[1:21:25] and all that god was doing and finally
[1:21:28] the scripture says
[1:21:30] that they were so stirred up that it
[1:21:32] says over here if you go
[1:21:34] all the way down to the 58th verse
[1:21:39] and he says and they cr he says

[1:22:04] dispensation of angels

[1:22:10] verse of the seventh chapter
[1:22:12] and when they heard these things they
[1:22:14] were cut to their heart
[1:22:16] and they gashed on him with their teeth
[1:22:19] and he
[1:22:20] being full of the holy ghost looked up
[1:22:22] steadfast into
[1:22:24] heaven and saw the glory of god and
[1:22:27] jesus standing on the right hand of god
[1:22:30] and he said behold i see the heavens

[1:22:45] and they cried out with a loud voice and
[1:22:48] stopped their
[1:22:48] ears and ran upon them with one accord
[1:22:52] and cast them out of the city and a
[1:22:54] witness
[1:22:55] laid down their coats at a young man's
[1:22:58] feet whose name was saul
[1:23:00] and they stoned stephen calling upon god
[1:23:04] saying lord receive my spirit
[1:23:08] amen and he knelt down
[1:23:12] and cried with a loud voice

[1:23:39] unknown god

[1:23:43] but paul knew there was only one god
[1:23:46] any one real god not man god not
[1:23:49] anything but god's god
[1:23:51] the real god and we could we could go on
[1:23:54] and
[1:23:54] say we could go into acts and we could
[1:23:56] talk about how they finally
[1:23:58] paul to finally they took paul and they
[1:24:01] threw him into

[1:24:14] spiritually
[1:24:16] and receive blessings we want to get on
[1:24:18] the front line
[1:24:19] but do we want to get on the front line
[1:24:21] of battle
[1:24:22] also not ashamed of the gospel
[1:24:26] you know sometimes circumstances rise up
[1:24:29] you know i i i think of uh
[1:24:33] of that little uh porter
[1:24:37] and you know brother rem tells the story
[1:24:40] about the porter
[1:24:41] who found jesus remember his mother had
[1:24:44] prayed for him
[1:24:45] and leaned over the fence and and and
[1:24:48] and the
[1:24:49] he got well and and then another one was
[1:24:52] led to the lord and
[1:24:54] and so he comes running up to brother
[1:24:56] brown he says brother brown i'm a
[1:24:57] christian now

[1:25:03] if as far as i know it's the same story
[1:25:06] all the way through
[1:25:07] and finally this little girl's coming
[1:25:09] home
[1:25:11] to be to see your mother
[1:25:15] and she's on the on the train with
[1:25:18] all of her friends you know the story
[1:25:21] that i'm referring to and and then so
[1:25:24] she's sitting there with all her friends
[1:25:26] and and and then one of the girls she
[1:25:28] with is says oh look over
[1:25:30] look at that old ugly hag there
[1:25:33] and that was her mama
[1:25:36] and she was ashamed she had an
[1:25:39] opportunity
[1:25:40] to be on the front line she had an
[1:25:43] opportunity he says oh yeah that's my
[1:25:45] mama but no
[1:25:46] she was embarrassed are we embarrassed
[1:25:49] to be on the front line
[1:25:51] are we ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:25:53] christ are we ashamed to testify to
[1:25:56] something that science
[1:25:57] doesn't know anything about that science
[1:26:00] can
[1:26:01] comprehend that the knowledge of the
[1:26:04] world
[1:26:04] has rejected are we afraid to be on the
[1:26:07] front line you know and
[1:26:09] and so that girl she pretended that she
[1:26:12] didn't even know that woman when she
[1:26:13] stepped
[1:26:14] off the but you know that porter was
[1:26:17] there
[1:26:18] and he was on the front line and he said
[1:26:21] wait
[1:26:22] a minute let me tell you
[1:26:27] that's your mother and let me tell you
[1:26:29] when
[1:26:30] in her day she was a looker she was
[1:26:32] better than you ever looked
[1:26:36] she was beautiful he started standing up
[1:26:40] for
[1:26:43] standing up for the gospel because that
[1:26:46] gospel
[1:26:47] was written in every scar
[1:26:50] on that mother's face on every scar
[1:26:53] on that mother's hands on the list the
[1:26:56] burns had
[1:26:58] taken her over and she was under he says
[1:27:00] i'll tell you why she's ugly
[1:27:02] she's ugly because when you were a baby
[1:27:05] that house caught on fire
[1:27:07] and she ran in there and brought you out
[1:27:10] and and you're
[1:27:11] beautiful today because she's ugly
[1:27:16] that's why you're beautiful you're
[1:27:18] beautiful because she's scarred up
[1:27:20] amen we ought to be beautiful because
[1:27:23] there's one that was scarred up for us
[1:27:26] amen and he couldn't he couldn't take it
[1:27:30] anymore
[1:27:33] when that finally came to that front
[1:27:35] line he couldn't take her acting like
[1:27:37] that
[1:27:38] and he stood up and he testified to what
[1:27:40] the
[1:27:41] what it was that mother went into those
[1:27:45] for her baby and that baby came out
[1:27:48] whole
[1:27:49] and she came out disfigured
[1:27:52] and that porter stood there to tell the
[1:27:55] story
[1:27:56] of a mother's love are you standing on
[1:27:58] the front line and talk about the love
[1:28:01] of our savior what he went through
[1:28:05] that we could be saved we need frontline
[1:28:09] workers i think of brother branham at
[1:28:12] the fair
[1:28:14] and that guy started talking about the
[1:28:16] story of jonah and
[1:28:18] how it couldn't be and and how the all
[1:28:21] whales mouths are only this big around
[1:28:24] and on and on he went no brother bram
[1:28:27] couldn't take it no more he said sir
[1:28:29] i beg your department that was a special
[1:28:31] fish
[1:28:32] that was a special well that was created
[1:28:35] by god
[1:28:36] amen he couldn't take it no more that's
[1:28:39] right
[1:28:40] you know and i wonder how many times we
[1:28:42] let people get away
[1:28:44] with just talking against the gospel
[1:28:47] preaching against the gospel
[1:28:54] i remember one time i went to the doctor
[1:28:56] i was really sick i was in a lot of pain
[1:28:58] i didn't know it was
[1:28:59] and the first thing that doctor said

[1:29:09] sent you here
[1:29:10] to make me well get with it
[1:29:18] yeah that's the kind of stuff you know
[1:29:22] what i mean he's not on vacation
[1:29:27] i wonder how many times we pass up
[1:29:30] the opportunity to stand on the front
[1:29:33] line
[1:29:34] we need to be front line workers and i
[1:29:36] want to close before
[1:29:38] the brothers come and take communion
[1:29:42] and it's a story the prophet of god
[1:29:45] tells about some prospectors
[1:29:48] and this man was a prospector and he was
[1:29:51] bringing his gold
[1:29:52] and and and he come to a campfire and
[1:29:56] he stopped in at the campfire on his way
[1:29:59] to
[1:30:00] to deliver his gold and and he was
[1:30:03] sitting there with the men
[1:30:04] and they all got to drinking and they
[1:30:07] told him

[1:30:12] and he said no i'm sorry i don't drink

[1:30:16] and they pulled their guns out and said
[1:30:19] you take

[1:30:28] that i wouldn't drink i promised her on
[1:30:32] her deathbed that mama i won't drink
[1:30:35] i i won't i won't become a drink i won't
[1:30:38] do it
[1:30:39] and they said well we you gonna drink or
[1:30:41] die
[1:30:45] he made his stand and he stood for the
[1:30:49] gospel
[1:30:50] and he stood for the promises that he's
[1:30:52] made i wonder how many of us has
[1:30:54] promised god
[1:30:55] if he would help us we would tell the
[1:30:57] world
[1:30:58] and then we've never told nobody i
[1:31:01] wonder how many we promised if
[1:31:03] if if he would just do something for us
[1:31:05] that we we would make a
[1:31:07] we would make a a testimony
[1:31:12] and all of a sudden they were fixing to
[1:31:13] take his life and
[1:31:15] shots rang out because there's a guy
[1:31:18] that couldn't take it no more
[1:31:20] he couldn't take them guys making fun he

[1:31:24] he shall sudden the bottle blew up and
[1:31:27] he come down there
[1:31:29] and he said you know son i was going to
[1:31:31] kill every single one of you
[1:31:34] and take all your gold but when you
[1:31:37] stood on the front line
[1:31:39] and testified of the promise you took
[1:31:42] and you testified of the of the of the
[1:31:46] stand
[1:31:46] that you chose to take for the gospel he
[1:31:49] said i couldn't stand it no more
[1:31:52] these guys making fun of you have you
[1:31:55] got to the place that we can't just take
[1:31:57] it no more
[1:31:58] these people running this gospel down
[1:32:01] can't take it no more than making fun of
[1:32:03] this gospel
[1:32:05] making fun of this message somebody
[1:32:08] is going to be on the front line
[1:32:11] standing
[1:32:12] for the gospel standing for the truth
[1:32:15] we need frontline workers from teenagers
[1:32:18] to the elderly
[1:32:20] we need them all it's time that we
[1:32:23] become
[1:32:24] front line worker
[1:32:27] amen if the brothers would go get
[1:32:29] communion
[1:32:31] let us stand as they go prepare
[1:32:36] communion
[1:32:39] and let's turn in our bibles
[1:32:46] in corinthians
[1:32:49] the 13th chapter or the 11th chapter
[1:32:54] i mean in the 23rd
[1:32:57] verse
[1:33:02] first corinthians 11 23
[1:33:06] for i have received the lord that which
[1:33:08] also i delivered unto you
[1:33:10] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:33:13] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:33:15] and we he had given thanks he break it
[1:33:18] and said take eight
[1:33:20] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:33:23] this do in remembrance of me and after
[1:33:27] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:33:29] when he had supped
[1:33:32] saying this cup is the new testament
[1:33:36] in my blood this do ye as often as ye
[1:33:39] drink it
[1:33:40] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:33:43] drink
[1:33:44] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:33:47] this cup
[1:33:49] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:33:52] come
[1:33:52] whosoever shall eateth that eateth
[1:33:56] this bread and drinketh this cup of the
[1:33:59] lord unworthy
[1:34:00] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:34:03] blood of the lord
[1:34:04] but let a man examine himself and let
[1:34:07] him
[1:34:08] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:34:12] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[1:34:14] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:34:17] not discerning the lord's body
[1:34:19] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:34:22] among you and many sleep
[1:34:24] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:34:26] should not be judged
[1:34:27] can i read that scripture again if we
[1:34:31] would get on the
[1:34:32] front line if we would judge ourselves
[1:34:37] we would not be judged but when we are
[1:34:39] judged we are chastened to the lord
[1:34:42] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:34:45] world
[1:34:45] wherefore my brother when you come
[1:34:47] together to eat
[1:34:49] carry one for another and
[1:34:52] and if any man hunger let them eat at
[1:34:55] home
[1:34:56] that you come not together unto
[1:34:58] condemnation
[1:34:59] and the rest will i set in order
[1:35:03] when i come if the brothers would come
[1:35:05] and
[1:35:07] you may be seated
[1:35:14] and we're going to pray and ask the lord
[1:35:19] to bless this bread and we're going to
[1:35:23] come
[1:35:23] take communion and may our communion
[1:35:27] meet tonight is we come and remember
[1:35:30] what he's done for
[1:35:31] us and all the testimony he's given our
[1:35:34] lives
[1:35:35] and all the blessings he's given our
[1:35:37] lives
[1:35:38] and all the salvation and deliverance
[1:35:42] and
[1:35:42] and healings that he's laid upon us
[1:35:46] may we come and take communion and say

[1:36:01] and preach and share this gospel
