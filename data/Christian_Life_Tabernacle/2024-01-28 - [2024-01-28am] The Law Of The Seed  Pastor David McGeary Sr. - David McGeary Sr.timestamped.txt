[15:55] morning amen God bless you
[16:00] let's go ahead and
[16:02] pray Heavenly Father truly we depend
[16:05] upon your
[16:06] covering father the only right we have
[16:10] to come into your
[16:12] presence Lord the way that that's been
[16:14] made has been dependent upon your
[16:17] covering Lord a perfect covering yes one
[16:20] Lord that hides us from what hides hides
[16:24] what we've done from you puts it in the
[16:26] sea of forgetfulness but also it gives
[16:29] us a robe an
[16:32] identity Lord some uh some right that
[16:35] gives us that we may come into your
[16:37] presence Lord and to lay hold of your
[16:40] word and to put it in motion Lord to
[16:43] lift up our hands and to you we thank
[16:45] you for your covering Lord we pray you'd
[16:48] be with us today now we commit the
[16:49] service to you Lord as always the work
[16:53] that's done here if it's just the work
[16:54] of man would just be another religious
[16:56] gathering but Lord we are hanging on
[16:59] your word that says that if just a
[17:01] couple of us come together in your name
[17:04] you promis to be there Lord we commit
[17:06] the service to you Lord that your word
[17:09] would have the preeminence that your
[17:11] name would be lifted up Lord that every
[17:13] need would be met and that you draw us
[17:14] closer to you we pray these things in
[17:17] Jesus name
[17:19] amen may be seated going to read Psalm
[17:23] 28 this morning if you want to go ahead
[17:24] and turn there
[17:26] and you know one thing that's stuck out
[17:28] to me as I was reading that this week is
[17:31] it's a Psalm that mentions the hands
[17:34] three
[17:35] times and as I was reading that you know
[17:37] the thought occurred to me it it
[17:40] matters where you have your
[17:43] hands it matters what your hands are
[17:46] doing it matters what your hands are
[17:49] handling you know
[17:52] in verse three and 4 it speaks of the
[17:55] workers of
[17:56] iniquity those that that prefer to do
[17:59] their own
[18:01] thing and the works that their hands are
[18:04] involved
[18:06] in David refers to it as the works of
[18:09] their own
[18:10] hands
[18:12] and it produces results that are
[18:15] associated with that
[18:17] work you know it says in verse 5 that
[18:19] it's
[18:21] destruction The Works that they're doing
[18:23] aren't resulting in anything being being
[18:25] built up but is resulting in their own
[18:27] destruction
[18:29] in verse 5 it speaks of God's
[18:32] hands God's hands are involved in a
[18:36] work in fact the destruction of those
[18:39] whose hands are busy doing their own
[18:41] thing is because they regard not the
[18:44] work of the Lord nor the operation of
[18:48] his
[18:50] hands see it matters what our hands are
[18:53] doing what our hands are
[18:56] handling and if you read in verse two
[18:59] there's an interesting statement there
[19:02] says hear the voice of my supplications
[19:05] when I cry unto thee when I lift up my
[19:09] hands toward thy holy
[19:13] Oracle well what's what's a holy
[19:17] Oracle that's kind of a strange word
[19:21] words matter in the
[19:24] scriptures fact it's not mentioned
[19:26] anywhere else in the
[19:28] Psalms but it's mentioned quite a bit in
[19:31] First Kings as Solomon is working on
[19:33] building the
[19:35] Temple it says in First Kings 65 and
[19:39] against the wall of the house he built
[19:40] Chambers round about against the walls
[19:43] of the house round about both of the
[19:45] temple and of the Oracle and he made
[19:47] Chambers round
[19:49] about the temple and the Oracle were two
[19:52] different
[19:54] things says in verse 16 and he built 20
[19:57] cubits on the the sides of the house
[19:59] both the floor and the walls with Boards
[20:02] of Cedar he even built them for it
[20:05] within even for the Oracle even for the
[20:09] most high
[20:11] place you see not only is there a
[20:14] difference between the temple and the
[20:16] Oracle but that Oracle was that most
[20:19] holy place that holy of
[20:22] holies and then if you read on in verse
[20:24] 19 and the Oracle he prepared in the
[20:27] house within
[20:28] to set there the Ark of the Covenant of
[20:32] the Lord so it was that holy of holies
[20:36] where that Ark sat and it was that place
[20:39] where he dwelt between the Cherub him
[20:42] that Mercy Seat it was the place of his
[20:46] presence so when we read Psalm
[20:49] 28:2 that says when I lift up my hands
[20:52] toward thy holy
[20:54] Oracle this is something more than
[20:57] lifting up your hands in church service
[21:00] or in prayer but it's reaching out to
[21:03] his
[21:04] presence Webster describes Oracle as a
[21:07] person or a place through whom a deity
[21:09] is believed to speak or where a deity
[21:12] reveals hidden knowledge or Divine
[21:15] Purpose well Amen brother
[21:21] Webster John makes an interesting
[21:23] statement because he says notice in
[21:25] Psalm 28 he doesn't lift up his eyes he
[21:27] does doesn't lift up his voice he
[21:29] doesn't lift up his heart or his mind he
[21:31] lifts up his hands it matters what
[21:34] you're doing with your hands John said
[21:37] in 1 John 1:1 that which was from the
[21:40] beginning which we have heard which we
[21:42] have seen with our eyes which we have
[21:45] looked upon and our hands have handled
[21:48] of the words of Life see I think all of
[21:51] us can say that we've seen something
[21:54] that our eyes have been opened to the
[21:56] word I think we would all agree that
[21:58] we've heard something that our ears have
[22:01] been opened but the question is are we
[22:04] taking our hands and are we lifting them
[22:07] up to that Holy Oracle and are we laying
[22:09] hold of his presence and putting that
[22:13] word to
[22:14] work are we laying hold of it working it
[22:19] becoming practiced with it that which
[22:22] our hands have handled I will lift up my
[22:25] hands to thy holy Oracle
[22:28] let's go ahead and stand this
[22:31] morning you know as I was reading that
[22:34] it occurs to me that it matters what our
[22:36] hands are doing and my prayer is that I
[22:39] get beyond what I've seen and what I've
[22:42] heard and I get Beyond just simply
[22:45] lifting My Hands In Worship or in prayer
[22:47] but I take my hands and I lay hold of
[22:50] that word of life that Holy Oracle where
[22:53] his presence is found for myself let's
[22:57] read that psalm 28 this morning starting
[22:59] in verse one unto thee will I Cry Oh
[23:02] Lord my rock be not silent to me lest if
[23:06] thou be silent to me I become like them
[23:09] that go down into the pit hear the voice
[23:11] of my supplications when I cry unto thee
[23:14] when I lift up my hands toward thy holy
[23:17] Oracle draw me not away with the wicked
[23:20] and with the workers of iniquity which
[23:22] speak peace to their neighbors but
[23:24] Mischief is in their hearts give them
[23:26] according to their deeds s and according
[23:28] to the wickedness of their Endeavors
[23:31] give them after the work of their hands
[23:33] render to them their deserve because
[23:36] they regard not the works of the Lord
[23:38] nor the operation of his hands he shall
[23:41] destroy them and not build them up
[23:43] blessed be the Lord because Heath heard
[23:45] the voice of my supplications the Lord
[23:48] is my strength and my shield my heart
[23:51] trusted in him and I am helped therefore
[23:54] my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my
[23:56] song will I praise him
[23:58] the Lord is their strength and he is the
[24:00] saving strength of his anointed save thy
[24:03] people and bless thine inheritance feed
[24:06] them also and lift them up forever

[45:16] most powerful weapon that's ever been

[45:52] a um an announcement um
[45:56] and before we we make an announcement
[45:58] for um the meetings uh we're we're
[46:02] wanting to make an effort to before the
[46:04] service as we know the prophet said you
[46:07] should get to Service uh 20 to 30
[46:09] minutes
[46:12] early well we got one
[46:15] amen you know to help create an
[46:17] atmosphere and uh what we we're wanting
[46:20] to do is try to place some of the needs
[46:23] up on the on the screen so as you come
[46:25] in 20 to 30 minutes early um that some
[46:30] of the needs will be placed up there so
[46:32] if we could just bind together in prayer
[46:34] uh some of the needs are ongoing um we
[46:36] have ones amongst us that have been
[46:38] believing for for miracles and some that
[46:41] are battling cancer so we just want to
[46:43] bind together in prayer um and bear one
[46:46] another's burdens as the scripture would
[46:48] say um and if if you could email those
[46:53] if you have a prayer request or
[46:54] something you want the church Church to
[46:56] be in prayer for if you could email the
[46:58] church or um you could send me a message
[47:01] we want to make an effort to get that up
[47:04] um you know in the busyness of life um
[47:07] and I just personally just to let you
[47:09] know I I was in talking to brother joean
[47:11] and he he mentioned uh brother Manet and
[47:14] his mother had just started uh chemo and
[47:17] and I had I had forgot that and I felt
[47:19] bad I'm like I'm I totally forgot that
[47:21] and I I realized man I need to I need to
[47:24] keep that on my heart and I think you
[47:25] you know the church is going through
[47:26] Growing Pains we're getting bigger and
[47:28] bigger and bigger and so I think things
[47:31] like that will be a very good tool so
[47:32] just email the church um or like I said
[47:35] you can send a a note to myself and
[47:37] we'll we'll try to get that up on the
[47:39] screen and uh we can start to be in
[47:41] prayer uh constantly for these burdens
[47:44] and we can make it a special effort to
[47:45] get here a little bit earlier Prayer
[47:47] Changes Things amen and uh we're just uh
[47:50] really excited uh for uh brother Craig
[47:52] Bo is going to be joining us um we're
[47:55] going to have some meetings on February
[47:57] the 16th through the 18th um Friday
[48:00] night um on the 16th we'll it's going to
[48:03] be a youth setting just more of a
[48:06] fellowship for the Youth um at this time
[48:09] uh we'll have more details to come but
[48:11] with the youth we'll probably be meeting
[48:13] at my home and just have a little
[48:14] Fellowship uh there uh but I'm really
[48:17] excited about um the uh Saturday morning
[48:23] on the
[48:24] 17th um we're going to have a Children's
[48:26] Service um it'll be at 11:00 a.m. and
[48:30] this is for the
[48:32] church uh it's not for babysitting for
[48:35] you to drop your kids off and leave um
[48:38] but this is a a a church service but you
[48:41] know brother brandham uh many time I say
[48:43] many times but I know there were times
[48:45] where brother brandham would Minister
[48:47] and he'd ask all the children to come up
[48:49] front and sit around and he'd minister
[48:52] to those children and and we're wanting
[48:54] to just make make a a special service
[48:57] for our children that Saturday so we'll
[48:59] have them come up front and brother
[49:01] Craig uh will minister to the children
[49:04] it'll be tailored for them and uh but we
[49:08] we want as much participation uh special
[49:10] meetings means a special effort uh so
[49:13] it's in three weeks so if uh you need to
[49:15] take off time or whatever you can do I
[49:17] think it'll be a blessing and then we'll
[49:19] have um an evening service that Saturday
[49:23] um at 6: p.m.
[49:26] will be geared for the Youth but I I
[49:28] believe that every service we have is a
[49:30] youth service CU we're all just about 18
[49:33] 21 years old whether you know it or
[49:35] not we we have a body on the other side
[49:38] that it's going to pick us up and you
[49:40] know that's what it's all about and then
[49:42] we'll only have one service that Sunday
[49:45] um on the 18th at 11:00 a.m. and um uh
[49:50] if you haven't um been acquainted with
[49:53] brother Craig Bo and his family um and
[49:56] his ministry it's going to be a a
[49:57] wonderful blessing so remember that in
[49:59] prayer uh we'll we'll um have some more
[50:02] announcements to follow as uh we we're

[1:05:54] morning so I have to put it on my
[1:05:57] computer with the letters about this big
[1:06:00] but when I went to print it they came
[1:06:03] out this
[1:06:04] small so if I I brought my magnifying
[1:06:08] glass and I if if if that helps if it
[1:06:12] don't uh would you just suffer with me
[1:06:15] um I I I'm I'm like half of
[1:06:19] barnas so uh but he healed him right and
[1:06:24] and didn't our sister sing this morning
[1:06:26] If He Did It Before He'll Do It Again
[1:06:29] amen he's not limited in power you know
[1:06:32] he could create another world just like
[1:06:35] that but he had a purpose didn't he he
[1:06:39] had a purpose why we are the way we are
[1:06:42] why we're in the place that we're in he
[1:06:45] had a purpose and it was to manifest his
[1:06:49] attributes he wanted to show himself to
[1:06:53] you and and his greatness oh I I hope we
[1:06:56] can just say something this morning
[1:06:59] that'll bless you but uh the scripture
[1:07:01] that we're going to read is in Romans
[1:07:03] chap 12 and uh I think it starts with
[1:07:08] the first verse so uh brother Billy will
[1:07:11] come and and read that and
[1:07:15] uh Romans uh 12 chapter one uh it says I
[1:07:20] bee I besee you therefore Brethren by
[1:07:23] the Mercies
[1:07:24] of God that ye present your bodies as
[1:07:28] Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:07:32] God which is your reasonable service and
[1:07:35] be ye not conformed to this world but be
[1:07:38] ye transformed by the renewing of your
[1:07:40] mind that ye may prove what is that good
[1:07:45] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:07:48] Amen God bless you may be seated
[1:07:52] amen yeah so uh we we've we said that we
[1:07:58] would try to minister a little to you
[1:08:01] out of the uh uh message uh Power of
[1:08:07] transformation and so we want to kind of
[1:08:11] uh uh go to that uh uh uh portion of it
[1:08:18] and uh this morning and I I have some
[1:08:22] big notes but I don't don't know if uh
[1:08:25] we'll be able to do it but I want to
[1:08:27] fellowship if I could this morning if I
[1:08:30] would have a title uh and I would I
[1:08:34] would call it the law of the
[1:08:36] seed the law of the seed and uh somebody
[1:08:40] uh made mention to me the other day I I
[1:08:43] thought it was uh uh kind of humorous in
[1:08:48] in the way that uh uh he was expressing
[1:08:52] uh you know I know on not a very
[1:08:55] excitable uh uh preacher in any way uh
[1:09:00] but you know a pastor really doesn't
[1:09:03] have any uh the gift of an evangelist
[1:09:07] you know what I mean or the gift of uh a
[1:09:12] a prophet and all those he's sort of a a
[1:09:15] combination of of all of them together
[1:09:20] you know what I mean so sometimes he
[1:09:22] might be a little Evangelistic
[1:09:24] sometimes he's more uh of uh you know uh
[1:09:29] teaches a little bit to this morning
[1:09:31] probably a little more on on the
[1:09:33] teaching side but his his desire is to
[1:09:37] feed the sheep uh it not so much how
[1:09:42] they're fed but what they're
[1:09:45] fed and uh the the the comment was made
[1:09:49] that that I just don't uh uh preach uh
[1:09:53] like the the the brothers in
[1:09:58] Africa and I thought well how does an
[1:10:00] African preach and then I thought well
[1:10:03] Billy's an African and and Ben W I don't
[1:10:06] know if he's here today but he's an
[1:10:08] African and Brother Paul's an African
[1:10:11] you know and I guess I preach like an
[1:10:16] Irishman you know what I mean so it's
[1:10:18] it's
[1:10:20] not how it said that's important it's
[1:10:23] what it
[1:10:24] said and our our goal and our purpose is
[1:10:32] to take from the
[1:10:36] storehouse and and remember the vision
[1:10:39] of the storehouse was to supply food
[1:10:43] that was going to be needed there are
[1:10:46] things in the message today that for
[1:10:50] years we
[1:10:52] bypassed because there didn't seem to be
[1:10:56] a a driving and a dying need for them
[1:11:01] but as the time came the Holy Spirit
[1:11:05] shed light on on that portion of the
[1:11:09] message and all of a sudden it became
[1:11:12] food amen you know and it and it started
[1:11:15] to feed our soul and I I've gone through
[1:11:19] my books I mean nowadays most of the
[1:11:21] people have phones and T and everything
[1:11:24] I didn't grow up with those so I grew up
[1:11:27] with books and I remember how that I
[1:11:30] would wait at my door about the time
[1:11:34] that the message were was being printed
[1:11:37] um my both of my these brothers have
[1:11:39] gone on to be with the Lord but brother
[1:11:41] Roy borders and brother Doug mugh
[1:11:44] started voice of God in their garage in
[1:11:48] Tucson and they started to print little
[1:11:50] books out and they would mail them out
[1:11:53] you you know what I mean and we used to
[1:11:55] wait for those
[1:11:57] books you know what I mean and tapes
[1:11:59] were unreal to reals you know they that
[1:12:03] we had boxes of real reels and we would
[1:12:05] have to get the machine and thread it
[1:12:08] through there and and then it would
[1:12:10] break and then we'd go out and buy a
[1:12:12] tape
[1:12:13] splicer you you know what I mean and and
[1:12:16] if we if we missed a portion oh we were
[1:12:19] devastated you know but that's what we
[1:12:22] we started on you know what I mean and
[1:12:24] so if you go back to my office I got
[1:12:26] little pieces of paper sticking out of
[1:12:29] books you know and and things are
[1:12:31] underlined and I'll go back to a book
[1:12:34] and there I skip
[1:12:36] paragraphs you know what I mean and now
[1:12:40] I go back and I read them and I'm
[1:12:42] filling in places that I filled in
[1:12:45] before you know I'd like to come to the
[1:12:47] day where everything that was in there
[1:12:50] stuck to me just became rich Rich to me
[1:12:55] so I want to uh try to minister
[1:12:58] something to you this
[1:13:00] morning that will help your
[1:13:04] understanding and give you
[1:13:07] Victory okay and and and I want to do it
[1:13:13] in in such a manner that you can look
[1:13:17] past your faith excuse me past your
[1:13:21] flesh to the
[1:13:25] promise okay it's because of by the
[1:13:29] promises of God that you're partakers of
[1:13:34] divine nature not through your
[1:13:38] flesh but by his word not by not by
[1:13:43] power not by might but by my spirit
[1:13:47] saith the Lord and so you might look at
[1:13:51] yourself as a very weak CHR Christian
[1:13:54] but that doesn't matter in the eyes of
[1:13:58] God because he knows who you
[1:14:01] are he he knows who you are and and so
[1:14:07] uh when when we we go to
[1:14:10] uh understand that uh we it is going to
[1:14:15] bring us to something that we can turn
[1:14:19] our hearts to and and what the message
[1:14:24] we were reading from was called God's
[1:14:28] power to
[1:14:30] transform okay so God's power uh God's
[1:14:35] power to transform and transform means
[1:14:38] to what to change so it doesn't matter
[1:14:42] where you're at as long as you can grab
[1:14:45] a hold and understand and have faith in
[1:14:49] that God has the power to change that
[1:14:54] amen I remember the couple that they
[1:14:58] were they were they they had fallen
[1:15:00] apart and they got coldhearted towards
[1:15:03] one another and and and they were
[1:15:05] starting to break up and everything and
[1:15:09] then then they they were finally
[1:15:10] dividing the stuff up you know you take
[1:15:13] this I'll take that oh I'll trade you
[1:15:15] the boat for the car you know what I
[1:15:17] mean they were going through all the
[1:15:19] stuff you know what I mean and and
[1:15:21] bitter you you know what I mean and and
[1:15:25] uh you know just just uh I you know just
[1:15:30] vile towards one another right so
[1:15:32] finally they got into the Attic So they
[1:15:35] got everything downstairs straightened
[1:15:37] up and everything she said you take the
[1:15:40] lawnmower I'll take the flowers and and
[1:15:43] they had all their junk piled up you
[1:15:46] know what I mean and their hearts are
[1:15:50] just and they got in the Attic now
[1:15:53] they're going through boxes in the attic
[1:15:55] and finally they open this box and there
[1:15:59] was a pair of baby
[1:16:00] shoes in
[1:16:02] there and they both reach for the baby
[1:16:07] shoes and all of a sudden it was
[1:16:11] restored to
[1:16:13] them what they came together in the
[1:16:16] first place
[1:16:19] for and don't you think that it would be
[1:16:22] good for us to have restored in our
[1:16:25] hearts why we became Christians in the
[1:16:29] first
[1:16:31] place that's right you understand so God
[1:16:35] doesn't matter what road you've been
[1:16:38] down come on son he doesn't matter what
[1:16:41] your past is he provided something for
[1:16:44] your past it's called the blood of Jesus
[1:16:47] Christ which cleanses us from all
[1:16:51] righteousness a amen he's got the
[1:16:54] chalkboard right there and so you could
[1:16:56] have all these list of things that is
[1:16:59] held against you now God doesn't lay
[1:17:01] those things to your charge Satan lays
[1:17:03] those things to your charge because who
[1:17:06] can lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:17:10] elect no why not because the seed of God
[1:17:15] remaineth in them so the minute that you
[1:17:18] confess those sins he's faithful and
[1:17:21] just to what forgive
[1:17:24] so all she's waiting for is for your
[1:17:28] part to say Aba father I'm
[1:17:33] sorry amen where did they go in the sea
[1:17:37] of God's forgetfulness to be remembered
[1:17:40] no
[1:17:42] more and and I I I'm not saying this is
[1:17:45] a Doctrine uh this statement I'm going
[1:17:48] to make right now but sometimes it's I
[1:17:51] say this about myself I I wonder why
[1:17:54] that I sometimes remember the things
[1:17:58] that I've done wrong or the things if
[1:18:02] there isn't still a part of me that
[1:18:04] wants some of
[1:18:08] it you know what I mean that I haven't
[1:18:11] completely died out to it
[1:18:15] yet you you know what I mean and and and
[1:18:19] so if I
[1:18:21] haven't what do I know I know that God
[1:18:24] has got a power to
[1:18:28] transform God's power to change God's
[1:18:33] power to bring something from one place
[1:18:37] to another no it's we don't have that
[1:18:41] power that's right you understand we
[1:18:44] want to go into that just
[1:18:46] a a little bit if you if you'll help me
[1:18:49] navigate this morning so we we've got to
[1:18:54] rely on on something
[1:18:57] yeah we and and you know if I could say
[1:19:01] it this way God does everything he put
[1:19:04] everything in order when he created is
[1:19:08] that right he when he created the
[1:19:10] heavens and earth everything had its
[1:19:13] place everything had its order and God
[1:19:16] creates everything that God does comes
[1:19:20] by his
[1:19:21] word that's right you understand so we
[1:19:24] don't know what's in God's
[1:19:26] mind right but when he speaks itl you
[1:19:31] understand now he's expressing his
[1:19:35] thought and what is a word it's the
[1:19:37] thought expressed so he speaks the he he
[1:19:41] thinks it in his mind it's there in his
[1:19:44] mind now God's not isn't in the element
[1:19:47] of
[1:19:49] time and that's one of the things that
[1:19:52] cripples our faith right is the time
[1:19:56] element it's it's a crippling to our
[1:19:59] faith CU if you're sick for so many
[1:20:02] years then that wears on your faith but
[1:20:05] God said you're healed God told Abraham
[1:20:08] you're going to have a baby you know
[1:20:11] he's already 80 I guess and how many
[1:20:13] more years does he go before he has a
[1:20:15] baby but what settled it what settled it
[1:20:19] was God said so in other words God spoke
[1:20:22] his thought so God in his mind Reich was
[1:20:26] going to use Abraham to start a lineage
[1:20:29] to bring his
[1:20:31] son he had it all in his mind exactly he
[1:20:36] had in his mind how that Abraham would
[1:20:39] have Isaac and Isaac would get Rebecca
[1:20:42] and they would have they would have
[1:20:44] these 12 sons and one of them would be a
[1:20:47] type of Christ and would go sit on the
[1:20:50] throne in Egypt oh my goodness God knows
[1:20:53] how to write a
[1:20:56] story he knows how to do
[1:20:59] things amen we we don't want we don't
[1:21:02] want anything around us to hinder the
[1:21:06] the ability of our mind to catch a hold
[1:21:09] of God and that's what our scripture
[1:21:12] says this morning by the renewing of
[1:21:14] your mind by the washing of the water of
[1:21:18] the
[1:21:20] word and so God expresses it
[1:21:23] he said let there be
[1:21:26] light now we could have all sat around
[1:21:30] and come up with all kinds of our ideas
[1:21:34] of what light is going to
[1:21:37] be some of us might say oh light is
[1:21:40] going to be a delicious tasting
[1:21:47] drink and oh my that is and it's just
[1:21:51] going to change your
[1:21:54] whole uh uh being and body that's what
[1:21:57] light
[1:21:58] is well that's perverted definition of
[1:22:02] light that's what they got today they
[1:22:05] got this light that light you
[1:22:07] know no we knew what light was what God
[1:22:13] had in his mind when he brought it to
[1:22:18] pass don't forget these fundamental
[1:22:21] principles that are Prophet gave us
[1:22:24] because he gave us these fundamental
[1:22:26] principles because now we need them more
[1:22:29] than ever because of the ground that
[1:22:32] we're navigating and the path that's set
[1:22:36] before
[1:22:37] us I'll tell you people that are
[1:22:41] separating themselves from this
[1:22:45] message are going to find the road that
[1:22:48] they're on is got a dead
[1:22:51] end
[1:22:53] and they're going to have to return back
[1:22:57] to the GPS of God's word and order to
[1:23:01] find your
[1:23:02] way that's
[1:23:04] right amen and you know how I feel I I
[1:23:08] it it's it's deeply in my heart I
[1:23:11] believe in preaching with all my heart
[1:23:14] and but I also believe that every
[1:23:18] congregation should listen to tapes as a
[1:23:22] congregation
[1:23:23] not just at at home I I because it's the
[1:23:31] source of everything we believe it it's
[1:23:35] it's the source of our Doctrine it's the
[1:23:37] source of Our Truth in fact there was
[1:23:40] secrets that were held in the word of
[1:23:43] God that were hid until the revelation
[1:23:46] of Malachi 4:5 the opening of the seals
[1:23:50] the secrets that were
[1:23:53] that were contained that were to give us
[1:23:56] rapturing
[1:23:58] faith and and you just can't deprive the
[1:24:02] people from hearing these
[1:24:05] things you know there there should be
[1:24:07] nobody don't don't let anybody get in
[1:24:10] between your
[1:24:12] relationship of the
[1:24:15] tapes let me just don't call it tapes
[1:24:18] the word of God brought to you in this
[1:24:22] day
[1:24:22] the spoken word of God yet nothing get
[1:24:26] in the way of the spoken word of God
[1:24:29] speaking to you
[1:24:32] directly Hall the church is built on
[1:24:39] Revelation it's built on on on on
[1:24:42] Revelation so we know what the what God
[1:24:46] meant in his mind when he said let there
[1:24:49] be light we now now now he was
[1:24:54] obligated Hallelujah to give the
[1:24:59] Revelation hold hold this for a second
[1:25:02] to give the revelation of what light is
[1:25:06] and what he meant and he did that by
[1:25:09] bringing it to
[1:25:11] pass now the word of God says that God
[1:25:14] must be worshiped in spirit and in truth
[1:25:18] so we know that Thy word is truth so
[1:25:22] what is the spirit the spirit is the
[1:25:27] intention or the
[1:25:29] interpretation of what he meant when he
[1:25:33] spoke the
[1:25:36] word hallelujah that's why the rain can
[1:25:39] fall on the just and unjust they can all
[1:25:46] Rejoice together not one side don't
[1:25:50] Rejoice the believer rejoice just from
[1:25:53] the rain just like the unbeliever join
[1:25:55] what
[1:25:56] separates the
[1:25:59] two right is one has the spirit not the
[1:26:04] anointing right right right okay not the
[1:26:09] rain which God gave that to to everybody
[1:26:13] but they have the
[1:26:16] Divine
[1:26:18] Vindicated
[1:26:19] interpretation of the word now they can
[1:26:23] walk in the spirit of the
[1:26:27] truth you understand what I'm saying so
[1:26:31] the spirit fell some spoke in tongues
[1:26:33] then some people went and they made that
[1:26:35] the evidence of the spirit so they would
[1:26:38] come into the emotionalism they would
[1:26:40] come into the anointing they would come
[1:26:42] into the blessings they would speak in
[1:26:44] tongues and they would say this is the
[1:26:47] evidence of the Holy Spirit that's not
[1:26:49] the spirit of it that's right
[1:26:53] right that's not what the spirit of God
[1:26:56] was given for the spirit of God was
[1:27:00] given to you that you could receive by
[1:27:04] divine revelation the full revealed word
[1:27:09] of God you can't separate the
[1:27:13] two the prophet of God said if the holy
[1:27:15] spirit is God's father and the father
[1:27:18] was Jesus's father he has two fathers
[1:27:21] that's right
[1:27:22] on come
[1:27:24] on and that won't
[1:27:27] work so you can't separate yourself from
[1:27:31] the word of God
[1:27:37] either you can't you can't separate
[1:27:40] yourself from the word of God you may
[1:27:43] not be everywhere that you want to be in
[1:27:46] your
[1:27:47] mind and you might not be everywhere you
[1:27:50] are by reading the Bible and coming
[1:27:52] under your conviction but by the law of
[1:27:55] the seed you will be what God said you
[1:27:59] would be and he will interpret
[1:28:06] you he'll do
[1:28:09] it amen so so there there's a law and
[1:28:14] that law is that everything will bring
[1:28:16] forth of its
[1:28:21] kind
[1:28:23] now so you help me this
[1:28:27] morning so everything would be forth of
[1:28:30] its kind so we we go back to the
[1:28:35] Garden of
[1:28:37] Eden and God had placed everything the
[1:28:40] way that he wanted
[1:28:42] it is that right everything was in order
[1:28:46] he came down and walked in the cool of
[1:28:48] the
[1:28:50] evening he saw Adam was lonely he said
[1:28:53] it's not good for man to be alone I'll
[1:28:55] give him a help
[1:28:57] mate so he takes Eve from Adam and he
[1:29:01] looks at her said I'll call her woman
[1:29:04] bone of my bone Flesh of My
[1:29:07] Flesh and and and now uh we know just by
[1:29:12] teachings that there was attributes and
[1:29:15] characteristics that Adam had in him and
[1:29:18] he took some of those attributes and
[1:29:21] character istics if we want to say that
[1:29:24] the feminine side and he's placed them
[1:29:27] over in another body but that these two
[1:29:31] bodies may become
[1:29:34] one that was his
[1:29:36] purpose so we know in the meantime that
[1:29:41] there was a great angel in heaven that
[1:29:46] was named
[1:29:48] Lucifer and our scriptures tell us that
[1:29:52] Lucifer wanted to exalt
[1:29:55] himself above Michael and above all his
[1:29:58] angels he wanted the
[1:30:00] preeminence he wanted to be the one so
[1:30:05] he kind of got hung up on all the
[1:30:09] gifts that God had given
[1:30:12] him Lucifer was
[1:30:15] gifted God endowed him with with many uh
[1:30:21] tremendous abilities and and and
[1:30:25] anointings and that's why it's real
[1:30:27] important for
[1:30:29] ministers not to let the anointing that
[1:30:32] they come under get to them that's
[1:30:36] it like it's something that they've
[1:30:39] got no it it it it it it that doesn't
[1:30:44] make you anything the only way that you
[1:30:47] should judge any Ministry is by the
[1:30:52] substance of the word that they
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:59] speak by the
[1:31:02] text if I could say it that way and so
[1:31:06] you and so so Lucifer comes along
[1:31:11] because he never
[1:31:13] repented of his
[1:31:15] desire to exalt
[1:31:20] himself so he finds Eve in the garden
[1:31:23] doesn't
[1:31:24] he and he he beguiles
[1:31:28] her now there is a difference between
[1:31:31] defile and
[1:31:33] beguile he had to beguile her first
[1:31:37] before the defilement
[1:31:44] came that's the pattern of sin how many
[1:31:47] knows that first of all it comes in your
[1:31:50] mind and it draws you away after your
[1:31:53] flesh and then it's the the ACT is
[1:31:57] performed and then the sin is
[1:32:01] conceived but there had to be a
[1:32:04] seed that came in
[1:32:07] first something that came in and
[1:32:09] beguiled
[1:32:11] you and deceived
[1:32:14] you and brought you to the uh the
[1:32:19] defilement or the birth
[1:32:22] of the
[1:32:25] sin how many knows that's in the
[1:32:28] Bible that's that's ABCs you know what I
[1:32:32] mean sin starts where in the
[1:32:36] mind that's why it's
[1:32:39] important you know that's the trouble I
[1:32:42] might as well say if I'm your pastor and
[1:32:43] if they want to blank this off on the
[1:32:45] tape or turn the volume down it's great
[1:32:48] but that's the trouble why in this lady
[1:32:51] of see an
[1:32:52] age that 70% of all marriages
[1:32:58] fail cuz people go out and they watch
[1:33:01] all this pornography they watch all this
[1:33:03] stuff and then they expect they're going
[1:33:05] to get that stuff in their
[1:33:07] marriage Lord that's
[1:33:10] sick those are
[1:33:12] fakes it's acting it's for money it's
[1:33:15] it's the it's the
[1:33:19] devil it's just like looking Glamour
[1:33:22] magazine and think that you're going to
[1:33:23] go buy some cream whoop it on your face
[1:33:26] and all of a sudden you're going to be
[1:33:28] some kind of beauty
[1:33:30] queen well you ought to go read Proverbs
[1:33:33] what they say about beauty oh she looks
[1:33:35] beautiful but she's got
[1:33:44] fangs you know oh she's pretty till she
[1:33:47] opens her mouth I
[1:33:50] want bite you with poison give me your
[1:33:57] neck you got to come into
[1:34:01] reality it's just like mirrors mirrors
[1:34:03] are made for you to look at forward not
[1:34:09] to you got to get rid of that
[1:34:14] junk okay so so that's the pattern of
[1:34:19] sin so he came and beg child Eve he said
[1:34:24] I surely you won't die and I've got
[1:34:26] something to offer you well what did he
[1:34:29] want to offer her he wanted to exalt
[1:34:32] himself above
[1:34:34] her he wanted to be in control of her
[1:34:38] Destiny he wanted to bring forth his
[1:34:43] idea of
[1:34:47] Eden okay so he had to have a pathway to
[1:34:51] to bring forth his idea of what he
[1:34:55] wanted to have because Lucifer was the
[1:34:58] one that was given the understanding of
[1:35:03] Science of
[1:35:05] Education of
[1:35:07] civilization so he could look from his
[1:35:11] perch by what God's given him and God
[1:35:14] spoke something God Did It by his word
[1:35:17] but Lucifer was able to sit back and see
[1:35:20] how scientific Ally that could be a
[1:35:25] possibility and he had the great need to
[1:35:29] be an
[1:35:32] explainer he had to explain everything
[1:35:35] let me tell you what he meant let me
[1:35:38] explain to you let me explain that let
[1:35:40] me explain that and so that's what he
[1:35:43] was he the scriptures uh bears that out
[1:35:46] he said oh no no no no you surely won't
[1:35:50] die
[1:35:52] God said she would
[1:35:57] die well he wasn't
[1:36:08] lying if you had Eternal lifeu you
[1:36:12] always had eternal
[1:36:18] life but what he was telling her was God
[1:36:22] said if you P partake of this flesh that
[1:36:26] flesh will
[1:36:30] die
[1:36:32] right they wouldn't
[1:36:34] die yeah if they kept the flesh out of
[1:36:39] the
[1:36:40] picture God revealed it every act that
[1:36:44] God had in its mind would have come
[1:36:46] forth in an Purity a and a beauty that
[1:36:51] is not comprehendable in US it wouldn't
[1:36:54] have been driven by emotions and and
[1:36:57] hormones and is this too Frank
[1:37:03] no it wouldn't have been driven by
[1:37:07] carnality it would have been an aity of
[1:37:10] spiritual Divine uh that that I can't
[1:37:14] even comprehend because I'm stuck with
[1:37:17] this old glob of Flesh and dirt
[1:37:26] so so he he comes in and he say surely
[1:37:30] you you won't die well he knew the law
[1:37:34] of the
[1:37:36] seed everything had to bring forth of
[1:37:38] its
[1:37:39] what
[1:37:41] kind so what was God belonged to God
[1:37:46] right he would never get control of
[1:37:49] that come on
[1:37:52] so
[1:37:55] he he had to inject his
[1:37:59] seed right so he would have an
[1:38:03] offspring that could bring to pass his
[1:38:13] Eden right okay so now the messenger
[1:38:19] takes us through this
[1:38:23] because you understand the power to
[1:38:26] transform in our generation came by the
[1:38:30] word through the mouth of a
[1:38:36] prophet so let's hold that
[1:38:39] there because I'm just rehearsing to you
[1:38:43] what he said I played it Wednesday night
[1:38:46] I I advise you to go forth and listen to
[1:38:49] it if you did
[1:38:51] this will mean more to you this morning
[1:38:54] amen if you didn't please
[1:38:59] do
[1:39:01] so he's got to in interject
[1:39:05] something so he said oh surely you won't
[1:39:08] die let me come into this relationship
[1:39:12] with you and I will give you my
[1:39:20] seed
[1:39:23] right so now we know the story it goes
[1:39:27] on and he introduces it to
[1:39:29] Adam and
[1:39:31] Adam and Eve have this act that Satan
[1:39:36] had revealed her and she takes his
[1:39:40] seed and she brings forth what
[1:39:45] twins but two different
[1:39:48] what two different fathers
[1:39:52] that's right that's why Jesus could look
[1:39:55] out and he says you're of your father
[1:39:58] the
[1:40:01] devil if you would had known Moses you
[1:40:04] would have known me am
[1:40:08] amen he even asked Peter who do men say
[1:40:10] that I am some say you're this some say
[1:40:13] you're that he looks at Peter he said
[1:40:15] Flesh and Blood didn't this reveal to
[1:40:17] you but my Father which is in heaven
[1:40:21] revealed it to you this is what I'm
[1:40:23] going to build my church on God
[1:40:27] revealing who he is to his
[1:40:36] seed not to
[1:40:40] everybody some people don't even have
[1:40:43] anything in them to believe
[1:40:48] with oh I can see your mind spinning I I
[1:40:51] hope I get them
[1:40:54] spinning all right so we find out that
[1:40:57] we begin to look at the
[1:41:00] lineage
[1:41:03] right kan's a
[1:41:07] worker his father is so he starts
[1:41:12] tilling the land he starts selling he
[1:41:16] starts buying so he got this field and
[1:41:19] it produces so much food and so now he
[1:41:22] can sell that so he gets more land then
[1:41:25] he decides to build cities and
[1:41:28] civilizations and culture and education
[1:41:32] and
[1:41:34] science he's building everything
[1:41:38] up but here's this little lineage over
[1:41:41] here who's just Shepherds
[1:41:45] amen no matter how hard they
[1:41:49] try they just can't
[1:41:57] grip what can's seed is
[1:42:01] doing than
[1:42:06] you they can't they can't grip it
[1:42:10] they're from two different
[1:42:12] sources they have two different
[1:42:16] fathers do you understand that so Cain
[1:42:20] is
[1:42:21] Cain has one thing so God had an
[1:42:26] Eden right now if Abel would have come
[1:42:32] forth in the Garden of Eden he would
[1:42:36] have lived according to the laws of that
[1:42:42] seed okay but now Abel is now in a world
[1:42:48] because Satan is trying to do what build
[1:42:52] his own
[1:42:56] Eden because there's two
[1:42:59] Edens that's
[1:43:00] right that's right we are living in what
[1:43:04] Eden now we are living in Satan's
[1:43:09] Eden who is the God of this evil
[1:43:14] age
[1:43:16] knowledge science amen education that's
[1:43:21] their
[1:43:22] God everything's based on science
[1:43:25] everything's based on education what
[1:43:28] word is always left
[1:43:33] out
[1:43:38] faith faith
[1:43:42] Revelation let me say this as your
[1:43:44] brother you are not made to operate in
[1:43:51] Satan's
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] Eden and the harder you try the bigger
[1:44:00] failure you will
[1:44:04] be God's
[1:44:07] children
[1:44:09] Hallelujah are the poor of this
[1:44:12] world but rich in what
[1:44:18] faith cuz I can do all things through
[1:44:21] Christ Jesus who strengthens
[1:44:27] me you are not Successful by education
[1:44:31] you are successful by Grace now King
[1:44:34] seed he's Successful by education he's
[1:44:38] Successful by
[1:44:40] science but we're only successful
[1:44:43] because God promised us we would not beg
[1:44:49] bread Hallelujah so everything you
[1:44:53] have is given to
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:45:00] you so you can't
[1:45:09] compare and
[1:45:11] and why do we
[1:45:14] need all this
[1:45:19] drunk
[1:45:22] I'd like to know as much of the word of
[1:45:24] God as some people know about
[1:45:31] computers did you know that God's
[1:45:34] kingdom that's coming that you're going
[1:45:37] to doesn't have
[1:45:41] computers how am I going to email you
[1:45:45] Billy I need to have a Facebook when I
[1:45:49] get there so everybody to know where I'm
[1:45:51] at what I'm going
[1:45:54] through I I think Facebook book is the
[1:45:57] biggest self-pity party I've ever seen
[1:46:00] in my
[1:46:01] life I don't got
[1:46:06] one but it ain't going to be there no
[1:46:12] automobiles no jet
[1:46:14] planes none of that's going to be
[1:46:18] there you say well what happens if if I
[1:46:20] want to visit Billy well what me and
[1:46:22] Billy will do is we'll just create a
[1:46:24] world
[1:46:25] Hallelujah we'll travel in a thought and
[1:46:29] we'll visit there
[1:46:30] for however long long
[1:46:36] is because it's
[1:46:40] eternity I'm trying to build to
[1:46:43] something they're two different
[1:46:47] seeds now that brings up a big question
[1:46:51] in the people's
[1:46:54] minds because if it would have stayed in
[1:46:57] God's
[1:46:58] plan there would been a
[1:47:01] complete definite line of
[1:47:05] lineage that's
[1:47:08] right and you understand in
[1:47:12] type when God called out
[1:47:18] Israel he SP specifically said because
[1:47:23] he was planning to have a
[1:47:27] son right he wanted that lineage to be
[1:47:32] Abraham's lineage or if I could say from
[1:47:36] Isaac which was the son of what promise
[1:47:41] ishmail
[1:47:43] was the seed of what the Flesh of
[1:47:49] unbelief
[1:47:53] amen it was a seed of unbelief but there
[1:47:57] was a lawlu of the
[1:48:01] seed that every seed would bring forth
[1:48:04] of its kind so when Satan got connected
[1:48:08] with Eve that law of the seed still had
[1:48:13] to
[1:48:19] apply
[1:48:20] you
[1:48:22] understand so if you take a
[1:48:25] horse and breed it with a
[1:48:28] donkey the law of the seed has to apply
[1:48:34] amen but what comes out
[1:48:38] uh a mule
[1:48:41] yes right we call that what a
[1:48:47] hybrid the mixing of two two different
[1:48:52] species
[1:48:58] together so what did Man start to
[1:49:02] do the sons of God saw the daughters of
[1:49:05] man were what fair and they took to
[1:49:09] themselves wives what did they
[1:49:14] do they
[1:49:18] mixed now the seed of
[1:49:22] God remained in his mind from the
[1:49:26] beginning the mixing wasn't of the seed
[1:49:29] it was the mixing was in the
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:35] flesh
[1:49:37] right that's why you could come down
[1:49:39] through life and you have an unbelieving
[1:49:41] father or some of you have uh because of
[1:49:45] the where you come from your father
[1:49:46] might have five or six wives and you got
[1:49:49] cousins and you maybe didn't know your
[1:49:52] father or didn't know your mother or
[1:49:53] whatever the circumstance might be that
[1:49:56] doesn't affect Hallelujah the
[1:50:01] Eternal seed of
[1:50:04] God it's still got to bring forth of its
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:13] kind so what took place was highb
[1:50:18] breeding yes sir or high
[1:50:24] bird and so and we know that's a mixture
[1:50:27] of two different kinds of species and
[1:50:31] and uh uh it it causes all kinds of
[1:50:37] uh all kinds of different
[1:50:41] stuff but none of it's
[1:50:44] original it was all
[1:50:48] deformed so all all of a sudden you come
[1:50:51] into the world
[1:50:53] what speaking lies borned in sin shaped
[1:50:58] in
[1:50:59] iniquity why because you come in the
[1:51:04] lineage right of the fleshly
[1:51:08] act of that
[1:51:13] seed now there's got to be a way for God
[1:51:16] to identify his
[1:51:18] own
[1:51:21] because we're all a hybrid
[1:51:24] mess is that would you agree with me on
[1:51:28] that uh without going into great uh a
[1:51:34] great uh
[1:51:36] uh the
[1:51:41] things that we know that we are living
[1:51:43] in Satan's Eden and it is a what a
[1:51:48] mess no longer wishing to retain God in
[1:51:52] their knowledge they gave themselves
[1:51:54] over God gave them over to a reprobate
[1:51:57] mind in the beginning God made them male
[1:52:00] and female there's a difference between
[1:52:03] man and woman but because of the
[1:52:08] Hing because of the mixing of knowledge
[1:52:11] and Science and education and
[1:52:15] civilization man has moved farther and
[1:52:18] farther and farther
[1:52:20] away from
[1:52:23] God so much now that they don't want to
[1:52:27] retain God in their knowledge
[1:52:31] anymore you cannot believe some of the
[1:52:35] statements that are coming out of the
[1:52:37] mouths of new casters these days
[1:52:41] directly saying these people that read
[1:52:44] that fictional book called The
[1:52:48] Bible
[1:52:52] quote it's the Christian
[1:52:55] extremists that are causing all the
[1:52:58] trouble in our country
[1:53:02] today what do you call that seed
[1:53:11] sewing now there's only one kind of seed
[1:53:14] that can receive that because every seed
[1:53:18] brings forth of its kind that's the seed
[1:53:21] of
[1:53:28] unbelief and it's coming on them and
[1:53:30] they're beginning to hear these
[1:53:32] things and hear these
[1:53:35] statements and then they're looking out
[1:53:37] and they're saying oh that's true that's
[1:53:39] true so
[1:53:41] much cuz Satan's cated him in what
[1:53:47] religion having a form of Godly but
[1:53:50] denying the power
[1:53:52] thereof all kinds of man-made forms of
[1:53:56] worship all kinds of new moral codes oh
[1:54:00] we'll allow woman
[1:54:03] preachers the word of God saids she
[1:54:05] couldn't handle the word of God the word
[1:54:08] of God says let her remain silent at
[1:54:11] home if she has a question ask her
[1:54:16] husband maybe some of you wives don't
[1:54:18] think your husband's spiritual enough
[1:54:20] start asking him really good hard
[1:54:22] religious
[1:54:24] questions you just might make him get in
[1:54:27] the
[1:54:30] Bible now he might say woman be quiet
[1:54:33] and stay in your place but I'll
[1:54:35] guarantee you you planted the seed it's
[1:54:37] starting to work in them you ought to
[1:54:40] have that answer the scripture says be
[1:54:42] ready for every man to give an answer
[1:54:46] hallu
[1:54:48] hallu why don't we do this why don't we
[1:54:51] do
[1:54:57] that it's your
[1:54:59] house you're the
[1:55:01] pastor that's right apply the
[1:55:05] token I was going to say kick him out
[1:55:08] but you can't you can't you can't do
[1:55:18] that so we have this
[1:55:21] great
[1:55:23] hybrid a
[1:55:25] mess that they're trying to say men can
[1:55:28] be girls and girls can be men and you
[1:55:31] don't need this you don't need that how
[1:55:33] many understand that we're in perilous
[1:55:38] times perilous
[1:55:40] times they try to come up with diseases
[1:55:43] and they create
[1:55:46] more they've gathered billions and
[1:55:49] billions ions of
[1:55:51] dollars for cancer
[1:55:53] research you know why they'll never kill
[1:55:55] CA cure cancer because it's a
[1:56:05] spirit all they know to do is that
[1:56:09] life
[1:56:11] right begins to deform cells how many
[1:56:14] knows that Satan's a
[1:56:16] deformer and now that deformed Life
[1:56:19] starts to grow so all they figured out
[1:56:23] they can do is we'll poison
[1:56:27] it will kill all the
[1:56:31] cells that that life lives in and maybe
[1:56:36] it'll
[1:56:39] leave I say poison
[1:56:45] it or I can shoot it with radiation and
[1:56:48] maybe kill it
[1:56:50] I say shoot it
[1:56:52] with radiation I don't care how you kill
[1:56:55] Satan I hate
[1:56:57] Satan he needs to die he needs to be
[1:57:01] poisoned he needs to be radiated in fact
[1:57:04] he needs to get thrown in the Lake of
[1:57:06] Fire where he will be no
[1:57:12] more I don't
[1:57:15] care but I tell you one thing I sure had
[1:57:18] a lot of faith
[1:57:20] amen amen i' make the spiritual claim
[1:57:23] this is my body God gave me this body
[1:57:27] this body was created by God to fulfill
[1:57:30] his word and I am going to stand against
[1:57:34] that life I am going to pray until God
[1:57:38] gives me the Revelation that that Spirit
[1:57:41] has no more place to
[1:57:46] remain go to
[1:57:48] doctors but the scripture says they
[1:57:51] heard the words of God but being not
[1:57:54] mixed with faith it profited them
[1:57:59] nothing how many efforts are you putting
[1:58:02] forth in
[1:58:04] education in the workplace and
[1:58:06] everything not mixing it with faith it
[1:58:10] will not profit you
[1:58:12] nothing now it'll profit the other
[1:58:17] seed right that's right but you've got
[1:58:21] to live by
[1:58:23] faith the seed of God Lives by
[1:58:26] faith The Whole World's corrupt in
[1:58:29] hybrid born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:58:33] come into the world speaking lies here
[1:58:35] clever come up here for a
[1:58:43] second let me read your notes see if
[1:58:45] you're on the same page
[1:58:47] I I can't read it so here's
[1:58:50] clever he's born in sin shaped in
[1:58:54] iniquity come in the world speaking
[1:58:58] lies does he have a
[1:59:01] chance he can't even know God he can't
[1:59:04] comprehend God all he's got is a
[1:59:10] mind and everybody can feed his mind and
[1:59:15] he can make intellectual what decisions
[1:59:19] some people make an intellectual
[1:59:22] decision about
[1:59:26] religion and they serve God
[1:59:29] intellectually the best way we they can
[1:59:33] you know what I say to that praise
[1:59:36] God I am not against intellectual
[1:59:44] religion if it'll make you act right do
[1:59:48] right yeah live right and be kind to
[1:59:51] others it's a good thing that's right
[1:59:54] you will come into judgment that's
[1:59:57] right for
[2:00:02] that boy some of you haven't thought on
[2:00:04] the word of God for a long
[2:00:07] time these are
[2:00:12] ABCs we're just too too caught up in
[2:00:16] accepting the world the way the world is
[2:00:19] so this guy don't have a
[2:00:22] chance so God does
[2:00:25] something before the foundation of the
[2:00:28] world he put a seed in
[2:00:33] here now the same law of the
[2:00:38] seed that is working in can seed come on
[2:00:43] now we don't know where that seed is now
[2:00:47] right because the lineage has been what
[2:00:52] hybrid it's been
[2:00:56] mixed is that right but God never lost
[2:01:00] his lineage he never lost what was in
[2:01:03] his mind he never lost the word of God
[2:01:07] and who was his my sheep know my voice
[2:01:11] another will not follow all the father
[2:01:14] hath given me will come he came for his
[2:01:18] own and his own received a not that
[2:01:21] wasn't just for
[2:01:23] Israel that's right that's right that
[2:01:26] was for all God seeds both Jew and
[2:01:33] Gentile so God's got to do something he
[2:01:35] this guy don't have a chance how are you
[2:01:38] going to get to
[2:01:39] God the only thing you can get to God
[2:01:42] with is your intellect and that's going
[2:01:45] to come up with your
[2:01:47] own understanding
[2:01:49] of what God is right the message or
[2:01:52] anything so he secured
[2:01:56] you Hallelujah
[2:01:58] eternally by writing your name on The
[2:02:01] Book of
[2:02:02] Life so he identified the name that was
[2:02:06] on the book with a
[2:02:08] seed that's right that's right now that
[2:02:12] seed just happened to fall
[2:02:15] into this
[2:02:17] heart or
[2:02:20] soul that came in the form of
[2:02:24] clever that's right amen born in sin
[2:02:28] shaped in iniquity you never told a lie
[2:02:30] in your life right confession is good
[2:02:33] for the
[2:02:34] soul I've told
[2:02:37] many but none of that was going to be
[2:02:39] laid to his
[2:02:42] charge why cuz the seed of
[2:02:46] God remains in them and that seed has a
[2:02:51] law it will bring forth of its
[2:02:59] kind so he has the
[2:03:01] seed so now God's got to bring that seed
[2:03:05] to life or germinate that seed so when
[2:03:08] the spirit of the word the
[2:03:12] spirit meets the spirit of the seed what
[2:03:17] is the spirit of the seed it's the
[2:03:20] intention for which the seed was
[2:03:25] planted if you plant a seed in a corn
[2:03:28] field and it brings forth the
[2:03:33] plum it's not the ground's
[2:03:35] fault that's right you planted the
[2:03:39] what the wrong
[2:03:44] seed so God's got to bring that to
[2:03:47] life he's got the power to transform it
[2:03:51] so he takes the spirit of the word amen
[2:03:56] not the
[2:03:58] Bible
[2:04:02] hallu everybody's got an interpretation
[2:04:05] of the Bible but the pure Hallelujah
[2:04:08] Divine Purpose amen for what the
[2:04:12] scriptures were given that's why the
[2:04:15] prophet says it says exactly what it
[2:04:18] means and God will interpret it by what
[2:04:22] bringing it to
[2:04:26] pass you say I don't understand anything
[2:04:29] read the scripture little ones believe
[2:04:32] what it
[2:04:34] says and let God do the
[2:04:38] rest so now this seed's in there so he
[2:04:42] is going to bring that seed to life he's
[2:04:44] got to germinate it so it's not the rain
[2:04:49] that's right that's right cuz the weeds
[2:04:52] are jumping up and down but the weed
[2:04:55] will never
[2:04:56] produce the
[2:04:59] wheat
[2:05:01] right it won't do
[2:05:03] it some of the wheat comes up and gets
[2:05:06] deformed some of it comes up and gets
[2:05:08] things but that true pure word that he
[2:05:10] have he takes the spirit of the seed and
[2:05:13] then the spirit of the
[2:05:16] word and I I had that quote SM but I I I
[2:05:20] can't read it to you it's in there he
[2:05:23] says when these things meet they will
[2:05:28] produce what it was planted
[2:05:35] for okay you're a clever fella
[2:05:41] clever it will it will
[2:05:45] produce so if you could
[2:05:49] just put this
[2:05:56] uh just put this paragraph up there
[2:05:59] paragraph
[2:06:02] 91 from the God's power to transform and
[2:06:06] then we'll also want to put up paragraph
[2:06:10] 98 because I I want to I want to uh give
[2:06:14] you okay Billy come here and read this
[2:06:16] out
[2:06:17] loud
[2:06:22] now he has his
[2:06:24] kind of an of an Eden Satan does now in
[2:06:30] these 6,000 years okay he had his kind
[2:06:32] where in Eden Satan does
[2:06:37] now in these 6,000 years he has formed
[2:06:42] not created but deformed God's whole
[2:06:46] earth his is create is creatures the
[2:06:51] animals inhib uh
[2:06:54] interbreeding hybriding trees plant
[2:06:57] human even what humans humans even to
[2:07:04] religion the B the Bible the church
[2:07:08] until he has got himself a complete
[2:07:11] Garden of Eden of science everything
[2:07:16] moving by science our
[2:07:19] automobiles everything that we have was
[2:07:23] given to us by science what man has done
[2:07:28] he has got his great Eden here to prove
[2:07:33] the message is
[2:07:37] timely his message is timely wait a
[2:07:39] second why is that
[2:07:42] important cuz it's the message that's
[2:07:45] going to germinate
[2:07:47] you that's right
[2:07:51] word and
[2:07:53] word bring forth
[2:07:58] life there's only one way he can get you
[2:08:01] to bring forth of its
[2:08:03] kind he had to send the
[2:08:07] word you were borned by the word in the
[2:08:11] beginning you must come to life by the
[2:08:13] word because you're word seed Hallelujah
[2:08:18] you're not Satan seed converted the only
[2:08:22] part that's hybrid is your
[2:08:26] flesh and that's why he's got to do away
[2:08:29] with
[2:08:29] it if you were to get the same body back
[2:08:32] what would happen to
[2:08:34] it it would die
[2:08:36] again how many knows brother Ram said
[2:08:39] that okay to prove the message is timely
[2:08:43] to prove that it's not some other age
[2:08:46] but Revelation 10
[2:08:49] look at the hybriding today to make a
[2:08:52] better or prettier not a better look at
[2:08:57] little children
[2:08:58] today just look at them you know brother
[2:09:01] BR goes on to talk about his daughter
[2:09:03] going to the
[2:09:06] dentist and her teeth were starting to
[2:09:08] twist he said another one's coming
[2:09:11] bucked out then you know what he says he
[2:09:15] says the time will come where the teeth
[2:09:18] will will be growing all over the
[2:09:26] place I think Brianna just had to get a
[2:09:29] tooth that was growing up in her pallet
[2:09:32] pulled down to her gum there's been
[2:09:35] other people who have had that
[2:09:38] right it
[2:09:40] it it's what it
[2:09:44] is so what have they done all this High
[2:09:46] breeding you know what he said it was
[2:09:48] it's the food
[2:09:50] yes they've hbr everything they've hbr
[2:09:54] our
[2:09:55] flesh how many heard him say
[2:09:58] humans okay so you know that wasn't me
[2:10:02] making any of this
[2:10:06] up right it
[2:10:09] it would you at least give me credit for
[2:10:12] saying what he
[2:10:17] said
[2:10:18] so it it it's producing all this stuff
[2:10:22] now come read this next
[2:10:24] quote I'm trying to build your faith
[2:10:27] this morning
[2:10:29] amen is that you already read that one
[2:10:32] okay read this
[2:10:33] one paragraph 98
[2:10:37] and99 now notice today hybriding cattles
[2:10:41] hybriding plants and science comes right
[2:10:44] back around the same science that does
[2:10:47] it says
[2:10:49] that's what's destroying the whole human
[2:10:53] race you read it in the you read it the
[2:10:55] same as I do well why don't we stop it
[2:10:59] it's because that they can't stop it
[2:11:03] God's word has said it would be that way
[2:11:07] but if you would think for a minute they
[2:11:10] are the instrument as Judah is scariot
[2:11:14] placing exactly the things that God said
[2:11:17] would happen
[2:11:20] amen it's doing it exactly on their own
[2:11:24] basis of
[2:11:26] Science by his science research in the
[2:11:29] same pattern he deceived Eve he he also
[2:11:33] has deceived the church which there
[2:11:36] which there Eve was a type now now Adam
[2:11:41] a type there again or Eve rather of the
[2:11:44] church notice what he did through the
[2:11:47] one wondering of for knowledge she
[2:11:50] slipped across the line between right
[2:11:53] and wrong by listening of by listen
[2:11:56] listening to Satan's perversion or
[2:12:00] deform
[2:12:01] deformity of the original word of God am
[2:12:05] amen what who did he
[2:12:08] hybrid the
[2:12:13] church you understand we're
[2:12:17] victims
[2:12:21] because God said it would be this
[2:12:26] way I'm I'm
[2:12:29] closing
[2:12:31] but what did he just say if you would
[2:12:36] think if you would stop and
[2:12:42] think what is the only thing we
[2:12:47] need
[2:12:48] the word of
[2:12:56] God he promised I will not see the
[2:12:59] righteous beg
[2:13:10] bread I will not leave you nor forsake
[2:13:14] you now I want to draw a picture here
[2:13:17] just
[2:13:18] morning cuz I want us to rise up in
[2:13:23] faith I don't want to pursue a
[2:13:27] movement I don't want to pursue an
[2:13:32] excitement I I preached here a while
[2:13:34] back laid it out just straight out of
[2:13:36] the message about the false
[2:13:42] Revival how do you identify a false
[2:13:45] Revival find out
[2:13:49] yes if they're
[2:13:52] associated with playing the
[2:13:55] tapes preaching the word of
[2:13:59] God living
[2:14:05] right I know we people react people say
[2:14:09] play tapes only and I believe in playing
[2:14:12] the tapes I believe in listening to the
[2:14:14] tapes and I hear the prophet of God say
[2:14:16] stay with the tape
[2:14:19] now if I just take that stay with the
[2:14:22] tapes then I can say tape only and I am
[2:14:27] doing that but he also came over here
[2:14:30] and he said preach the word of God
[2:14:33] Amen and the word's not delivered by a
[2:14:36] mechanical
[2:14:37] advice so so what is
[2:14:40] it you can hybrid it by taking this and
[2:14:44] then you take all that he said
[2:14:48] that's right you search the the word of
[2:14:52] God the scriptures for in them you'll
[2:14:54] have eternal life and if you're seed
[2:14:57] they they they speak of of of
[2:15:02] him so we we we see that all this is
[2:15:06] here because the message is timely we we
[2:15:09] see here exactly what he was said they
[2:15:12] can't discern the right and wrong so I
[2:15:15] want to take you back just for a moment
[2:15:19] okay because we're all in this
[2:15:21] Eden right Satan has found a
[2:15:26] way to
[2:15:28] attach his Hybrid part of
[2:15:32] us which is the
[2:15:35] flesh that makes sense to you okay the
[2:15:38] seed
[2:15:40] isn't the seed remains in me right but
[2:15:43] this was born in what s sin and shaped
[2:15:47] in iniquity
[2:15:48] and came into the world speaking lies so
[2:15:51] what has he promised
[2:15:52] me a new
[2:15:55] one oh happy day when Jesus comes to
[2:16:00] take away
[2:16:03] Hallelujah that makes me want to
[2:16:07] shout a new
[2:16:10] body I haven't lost a
[2:16:14] one oh Glorious Day even so come quickly
[2:16:19] Lord Jesus look up your Redemption draws
[2:16:23] nigh but in the beginning he made a
[2:16:27] statement when Eve was defiled by
[2:16:33] Satan he never defiled God's seed that's
[2:16:40] right right Adam went out by his own
[2:16:44] choice because he had the characteristic
[2:16:47] of Christ and he had to redeem his
[2:16:54] wife he took
[2:16:56] her he's could take care of
[2:16:59] her now I don't care if you don't like
[2:17:01] your wife you married her you provide
[2:17:03] for
[2:17:07] her you don't run off and get yourself
[2:17:10] another one that's
[2:17:13] right very few
[2:17:15] circumstances in which
[2:17:18] you can do something like
[2:17:23] that
[2:17:25] so when that
[2:17:28] when God found
[2:17:31] them in that
[2:17:34] condition he said statement he said I
[2:17:37] will put
[2:17:39] enity between thy seed and the serpent
[2:17:46] seed now there was going to be an
[2:17:51] enity how many knows the definition of
[2:17:59] emnity very few
[2:18:02] people it means this here is the the
[2:18:08] definition of uh
[2:18:11] enity in uh in the the Bible or or the
[2:18:18] definition emni is the state of
[2:18:23] feeling a state of
[2:18:27] feeling uh
[2:18:32] actively opposing
[2:18:35] yes our he says it it says here he
[2:18:41] says emnity is the state of feeling
[2:18:46] actively
[2:18:48] opposed or
[2:18:50] hostile toward
[2:18:52] someone or
[2:18:56] something now so what he said was I am
[2:19:01] going to put an
[2:19:05] active
[2:19:07] opposition and
[2:19:09] hostility between the
[2:19:16] seeds
[2:19:19] Oh you mean well I just read it this
[2:19:23] whole perversion and everything is for
[2:19:26] one purpose it's against the word of
[2:19:31] God Satan has never stopped from day one
[2:19:36] trying to discredit the word of God
[2:19:39] surely you won't die yeah that was a
[2:19:42] half
[2:19:45] truth but he gave gain control of an
[2:19:50] Eden now this whole

[2:20:26] the Vindicated seed of God that you are
[2:20:29] meant to
[2:20:36] be it's
[2:20:42] opposition it ain't an idea of us living
[2:20:45] right in this world

[2:20:50] you're not a part
[2:20:58] of the whole thing's against

[2:21:28] Prosperity the more prosperous you are
[2:21:31] the harder it is for you to make
[2:21:33] it cuz the less you have to use

[2:31:15] me
[2:31:19] that judgment was truth amen I'm
[2:31:23] guilty I did it I'm ready to
[2:31:30] die but David had something in them
[2:31:33] wasn't it it was the seed of
[2:31:35] God and there was a blood sacrifice the
[2:31:39] only provided place that God meets the
[2:31:42] believer Hallelujah because that seed
[2:31:45] had to bring forth
[2:31:48] what the
[2:31:52] lineage the
[2:31:55] identifier of all that were
[2:32:01] his the
[2:32:03] word and the word
[2:32:07] came and those that were his received it
[2:32:12] gladly and then Paul not too long later
[2:32:15] he says there's there's there's Terrors
[2:32:19] amongst your
[2:32:22] Feast people saying I'm of this and
[2:32:24] people saying I'm of that spots in in
[2:32:27] your
[2:32:30] wrinkles it was already Jude finally
[2:32:33] wrote he said it's necessary for me to
[2:32:37] write to you of the common
[2:32:42] salvation this morning it's needful
[2:32:47] for me to remind
[2:32:50] you that you are the seed of
[2:32:54] God you do not have to make a deal with
[2:32:58] the
[2:33:01] devil you do not have to
[2:33:04] compromise what's he looking for today
[2:33:07] is
[2:33:09] uncompromising girls if you go to a
[2:33:11] public school you do not have to dress
[2:33:14] different for public school than you do
[2:33:16] for
[2:33:19] church you don't have to wear flats to
[2:33:22] church and high heels to
[2:33:26] school that's your
[2:33:31] enemy those high heels are are your
[2:33:34] enemy they're going to keep you and hold
[2:33:39] you
[2:33:40] back from becoming what you really can
[2:33:44] be why does anybody want want to present
[2:33:47] themselves to a bunch of
[2:33:48] unbelievers that won't even accept them
[2:33:51] for the
[2:33:53] character you know Martin Luther King
[2:33:55] made a statement that I really have
[2:33:57] always appreciated he says I long for
[2:34:00] the day where a man is judged by his
[2:34:02] character and not the color of his
[2:34:08] skin wouldn't that be
[2:34:11] something if we would start judging one
[2:34:14] another by our character not by our
[2:34:17] preaching style not by the color of our
[2:34:19] skin not by where we came from but we
[2:34:21] would judge one another by the word of
[2:34:24] God Amen so you see what we're what I'm
[2:34:28] trying to tell you this
[2:34:30] morning I'm wanting to lift your faith I
