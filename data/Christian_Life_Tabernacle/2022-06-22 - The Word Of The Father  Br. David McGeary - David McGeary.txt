our gracious father god lord our hearts are lifted towards you lord i'm so grateful the joy that i feel in my heart lord knowing that [Music] you committed and swore by yourself for there was no greater that you'd never lose me you'd never leave me you'd never forsake me and that you would finish the work in luke the 19th chapter of the gospel of luke and we'll we'll read the scriptures found here let's see which one of these glasses works among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature so he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacakias make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house notice something he knew his name didn't he he knew where he was and he knew what he had planned for him amen and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully when he saw it they were all murmuring saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that that is a sinner and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken anything from any man by false accusation i will restore unto him fourfold that was a confession right so that's what happens when you come into the presence of the lord you know to make it everything comes out doesn't it and jesus said to him this day is salvation good to see you we've got a lot of miles in this journey don't we but god's been good so tonight we're going to listen to 20 minutes out of the sermon brother branham preached in 1954 called show us the father show us the father and you know when you want to see the father you want to see him in present tense zacchaeus didn't just want to hear the stories about what that he had done worked everything but he wanted to see for himself he wanted to look upon his face and and to look for himself and see the things of god and so in this message show us the father brother brahman says that there's four places that you can see god at four places you can see god i like to see god don't you amen i like to i like to see him when when uh you know somebody comes in and ministers the word of god and it's right down the line you know you give a song and it's right in the line uh you some you know you just see you know it's the hand of god you know god's moving you know and so he said there's four places you can see god one is in his universe and we know in romans uh uh 1 20 it says the invisible things of him are clearly seen in the visible things he creates and brother branham goes on and explains how that you can see is that right so the jesus said if you can't believe me for my word's sake believe me for the works i came not in my own name but i came in my father's name and he says the works he says it so judge me by my works you know what i mean and so and then he said which of you can convict me of sin or accuse me of sin so we could actually see by the things that jesus did it showed that that's where god was and the last place that we see god is in his people amen so we want to listen to this and the reason we're listening to this because i sat in church and listened to it the other day and i was so excited i just said i got to play this for the people but he's talking about the spirit and he's talking so he's talking about this little section we'll pick it up just 20 minutes then i'll close maybe with another 20 minutes and we'll have a nice time in the lord right and then we'll go we'll go out and be about the father's business isn't that what we want to be we want to be about the father's business we want to we want to do the works of the father so we'll let's we'll go back we'll identify him in the scriptures we'll talk about at the moment in terms but anyway okay let's just sit back how many believes it's the voice of god i do amen i i want you to know what firmly what i believe i think a minister if he's going to preach to the people if he's going to receive blessings of him that he should be very clear on what he stands for okay i don't believe the message is over i don't believe that we've had brother branham now for 63 years we know what he said and we're waiting for the spirit to fall and to anoint us i i want you to know what i firmly believe because there's a lot of movement towards those things i firmly believe with all my heart there are still revelations contained in the things that brother branham teaches that has spiritually been stored up and they're still there to lead us and guide us i do not believe that the holy spirit is going to give a new leadership to the church outside of the voice of his messenger and i want you to be very clear and and i believe that that's why i am the way that i am some people might refer to me as an ice cube preacher but that's okay i want my fire to be under the right thing amen that's when i want my fire to be underneath the revelation that god is still leading us and he sent a guide and what we have need of is still in those tests like paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it's the power of god and the salvation and to me the message of william branham is the gospel for the hour and age that we live in so god bless you as we list for these minutes i think you'll really enjoy it you can go back and listen the tape's only 59 minutes long so you can finish it up real easy god bless you one time here's some time ago at infidel he crossed their trucks and he looked over at me and he said man he said i rented this truck and they charged me 20 dollars of gas and i only drove three miles i did the math real quick and that wasn't too bad but uh so i told him i said well i said anytime you need a truck or something like that you just call me i got an extra truck well i'll come get it we talked a little bit and i said i pastored church here in in bedford texas he says well i pastor a church in haltom city i said good he said i'd love to sit down with you and talk to you about all the things that god's doing the promise of our age water baptism the evidence of the holy spirit may not have to sit down and and talk to you about all these things because i believe those are the things that god likes us to talk about so it was really exciting so i don't know are we going to be able to go forward okay they're going to rewire all right and we know that in when people talk about adopted people want to be adopted and and the scripture tells us that that we were lost and but now god through adoption brought us in and now we're joint heirs with him so we were made equal we were sinners and as sinners we could never partake of the things that god had for us to partake of that that avenue was cut off of us because the works and the business that we were about didn't represent what the father was about okay but so to be adopted is you're tutored by the holy spirit we understand that you're taught you you go through things and and you know i have some of the brothers working for me and uh you know i'm always yelling at him you know you know do this do that why did you do that for you know but i'm a tutor you know what i mean i'm trying to get them to think the way that you think when you're working on a job and they've never been on a job before they don't have the terminologies that i have for things but they're learning quick and the minute they get it they pour in there but there there's a time comes when we want to listen to this portion is is we want you to hear the spirit of the prophet of god and how and what he talks about what the holy spirit is and how the holy spirit is in fact you know the scripture says the holy spirit didn't even come to speak of itself to do what bring you into remembrance of all the things that i've taught you so we believe in the baptism of the holy spirit it's not a third person it's not something different there's only one god and when you're filled with that one god you're filled with that one god and there's only one way that a man can come to be filled with that one god is that nobody cometh unto the father but by me i will not leave you comfortless but i personal pronoun will come again and i'll be with you even in you till the end so let's list 20 minutes and and then i'll subtract what i just said off of what i was going to say after as after uh god bless you after god is in his universe god is moving in his universe watch wish we had time to go into that real good and deep one time here's some time ago at infidel he crossed the country and he was making converts going to people and tell him that there was no such a thing as god he went to england no preacher was seemed to want to attacked him he was a powerful man and when he come hell i've been wrong did you come there according the way i thought it or is the bible right and there's that big bully infidel that preachers is afraid to attack god picked out nature got her and converted that man and he's a preacher in the field today preaching the gospel of the lord jesus christ why if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately crowd god speaks out of his nature you believe that god is in his nature watch how everything takes place millions of things we could speak of if time would just permit it how god is in his nature you believe god's the nature in this universe now god in his word god's promise to bless his word he'll watch over his word to perform take care of it you believe that the word of god jesus said was a seed and it's the seed of god every word is the seed the sword went forth sowing seeds jesus said and when a deceit was the word of god not every word of god is the seed of god and it will produce just exactly what the bible says it is if you need salvation take the seed of god come on to me all your labor and heavy laden if you need healing i'm the lord that healthy anything you have need of is a promise this bible god will take care of every promise listen to this i say this reverently quietly so he can remember what god will do the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any divine it's right there in a tree right that if it doesn't where does it come from the tree only thing it does is just suck the water from the earth and it has to draw more than its potion because it has to draw so much into it till it pushes out it'll push out branches then it'll draw it'll push out limbs and then it'll draw push out blossoms and push out oranges it's just constantly drawing and pushing out drawing and pushing out that's the way the man is is born to the spirit of god when he takes god's promise into his heart and look the only thing that god does is plant you in jesus christ by the holy ghost and everything you have need of in this earth journey is in you when you receive the holy oak amen the only thing you have to do is draw and push out i'll tell you what some other christian tonight you're not drawing dividends on your baptism of the holy ghost draw in and drink and drink and drink and drink till you push out salvation push out divine healing push out the baptist holy ghost just drink drink drink and you're planted by the inexhaustible fountain of life which is jesus christ he is thirsty ladies and gents hear the earth say come whosoever will let him come and drink from the fountains of the water of life freely amen what a beautiful thought of in there god in his word god's got to keep his word we just had time and pushing wrong with that that's what you should do but as you become a christian go in the bible look around see what's yours amen when you buy a house you look around and see what's yours don't you watch it's like putting in a big arcade i'll go around in a big arcade that's what it is i'll go around and look at this it's mine now if you want to stand back yeah yes i believe it but i i'm scared i'm scared i can't do it well just go ahead that's all for you you'll ever get but me i like to look around like abraham said walk up and down the land see what you got amen i like to see whether it is thomas is what he said i believe it's in his word this great big arcade of christ by one spirit we're all baptized into this arcade if something looks a little high for me i'll just get a ladder and get up and examine and see what it looks like that's the way to do it pop my face into the room for man can't touch it's hanging there god promised it to you there's a stepladder just keep climbing you'll get it reach up for it amen ah sometimes i'm ashamed to think oh little petty faith when god's eternal word laser which is god himself manifested in the word look what he said here's a good thought he told joshua or not joshua but um moses i have given you palestine it's yours and it was all walled up and fortified with philistines and big walls around it but i'll give it to you it's yours now go take it there's the audi go take it divine healing's yours go take it it's fortified up with doctors belief and agnostics belief and everything else but go take it god said it's yours amen the holy ghost is yours go take it your pastor don't believe it but the bible said it was so go take it god's word you know how them they come back say oh we look like grasshoppers we can't do it joshua said yes we can god and soul that's the promise i believe it peter said the promises into you and your children and they must follow up even as many as the lord our god shall call amen i believe the baptism of the holy ghost and all the fullness of god is raining down the church today is for whosoever will god promised it any worse it's ours let's take it let's go over and possess the ground nowadays god didn't go there bible said that god was in christ reconcile the world to himself you believe it yes sir when he was here on earth he said he was god he looked like god he acted like god he preached like god he healed like god he died like a prince and rose like god he was god carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day four o blind fanny crosby said pass me not old gentle savior hear my humble cry while another dire calling do not pass me by thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me who have i hold earth society whom in heaven believe that's right she knew who he was god was in his son reconciling and let's pray heavenly father thank thee for thy goodness and i mercy oh and i think of you standing out under your universe looking down upon the earth i think of you what are you watching galilee upon the mountains of nighttime watching the great plantations and so forth great planets of the heavens and the solar system knowing that you made them spin them out there with your hands gold your breath in the palm of your hands and every star come into existence hallelujah they send your owner in order to take the stinger out of death to put it in your own body to put sickness in your own body to bear it for us give it to us in the word confirmed it by the holy ghost you in your word in your son now in your people how could we doubt any lord show us the father and surprises us lord we believe tonight that you're the same god that walked on galilee we believe that you're the same one back down here before there was a star in the heavens it said let there be light and the sun coming to existence god be merciful for us and i pray tonight that your sweet for revival across this city here and all these great walls of differences will be tore down and the holy ghost may have premised in every heart grant tonight that the lame walk the blind see the death here in the dumb jesus of the very heart of god jesus you're manifesting his father's love to the people then i think god was in his son and now he said a little while the world shifts me no more yet you'll see me for i'll be with you even in you then god is in his people tonight showing the same signs and wonders that he did when he was in galilee same sign waters he did when he come to the wilderness and the pillar of fire he's the same jehovah god today that was back underneath when he come down in nature amen oh my well i look out and think how petty and how little and we people who confess that we have kissed the rims of the cup for the blessings of his power and can sit still and look upon this sinful world and hold our peace i wonder sometimes if we don't need another dip from god amen all right where's your faith live you morning stars and shout the praises of god that's right don't let the devil put one thing over you he's nothing but a bluff he hasn't got one legal power when jesus christ died at calvary he stripped him of everything he had the only thing tonight he's got is the bluff right we have legal possessions by jesus christ every believer in here has a bank book i'm a deposit that has made a calvary in the blood of jesus hallelujah that is where he beat satan to pieces that's where he robbed him stripped him down i can see jesus when he died there as emmanuel on the cross his soul david said no wonder he said do not leave his soul in hell neither suffered holy one to see corruption jesus said you destroy this body and i'll raise it up the third three days he's done your grave he knows he come out within 72 hours he noticed the honor for david said so one promise but he believed the word of god that's right look 600 and some promises of divine healing and we set slumber and oh my claim to these children rise believe me that's right i can see him when he died his soul went down into the reasons of the lost i can see him knock at the door at the law somebody said who is it open the doors in there the mainland souls are in prison waiting for the day of judgment he said you ought to believe enoch you ought to believe the prophets i am the virgin born son of god that he said he come with ten thousands of his saints i am he i'm the one and everything was written to me in my father's word i have confirmed it down around the cross it's finished closed the doors that's all of it they had to recognize the earth knew it was them it's shocked with their great earthquake when he died the moon her son hid their face the very creator of them was dying on calvary sun went down in the middle of the day i seen him go right on down to the doors of hell oh i feel religious tonight look brother i've seen i know what i'm talking about i'm not lost in the fog no sir i know right where i'm standing yes sir and it goes ascended right on down into the lower regions of hell knocked on the door satan comes who's there that open up who are you open up say homestead so you finally arrived did you said i thought i had you when i killed abel when i throw daniel in the lines then i thought i got you i thought i got you when i put the hebrew children to fire furnace one of the headed john the baptist i thought i had you but now i got you you're here you're right you're just satan said jesus give me the keys of death and hell you don't process tonight oh yes i did i possess him because back in regards and eating adam's sin but he said i'm the virgin born son of god i come down from the father's bosom i've just died down along calvary and my blood's still dripping from the cross i come down and take over right you ain't scaring nobody from this on you was a bluff one time you had them but you haven't got them anymore i'm the professor that's right i'll give my church the keys to the kingdom reached over his side pulled the king cheese off of him smacked him in the face and set him back and shut the door so hard to shut the st take the hell in his eyes hallelujah he's a conqueror since he ripped the veil of jews you ain't bluffing him he knows where he's at i can see him coming back up he's coming towards daylight there's some more people up there the old testament saints they couldn't go to heaven they had to stay in paradise because the blood of bulls and ghosts won't take away sins it just covers sin but jesus has shed his blood that divorce is sin puts her away wipes her out i can see there's another place up there called paradise i hear somebody say who's there open the door abraham that sarah come here come here sarah that's the man that i entertain that day of the oak tree hallelujah there he is that's him daniel said what you say put well that's the rock that i saw you down the mountain without hands there comes deacon say i've seen him and he was in the heavens and the clouds looked like dust under his feet said boys you all have leaves on the shedding of the sacrifices of brother bulls and ghosts but sin is divorced now we're going up don't you remember what david said in the psalms he led captive captain give gifts to man yes i remember what david said i believe you too i know you did come on i hear abraham say lord the god of abraham oh i can hear him say can we make a little whistle stop in jerusalem yes i got 40 days going and struck my disciples we got to go in the world cast out devils and names i better talk to him a little while before we're going up so you fellas can just walk around a little while hurry up now it's coming towards daylight the easter morning pretty soon my i can see the big morning star looking around over the skies comes down like a whirlwind hits on the grave and overcomes the grave and angels stood there he rose up and towed in the old testament saints the bible said so matthew 27 says many of those who slept in the dusty earth rose and come with him i can hear the angels on the inside of the wall and say who is this prince of glory i hear the old testament saints the lord of hosts mighty in battle and they press the buttons in the gates twinkle and here comes jesus right down the street to conquer with all these cries hallelujah victor he left captive captain give gifts to man right down the streets of the old testament of the jew jerusalem walked out of the presence of the power that fathered here they are they died in good faith waiting for my blood he said come up here son and sit on my right hand till i make all your fools your footstool [Music] you think i'm crazy don't you if i'm crazy let me alone i'm happy this morning amen i'll tell you brother it's time to make this thing pop make my other foes a footstool kind heavenly father bless every man and every woman in here tonight get glory out of the service baptized especially with the holy ghost i pray that you'll heal every sick person in the building tonight may your spirit come upon them these times and wonders be done if i've did wrong by preaching excuse me send the angel of god anoint your servants and send a great prayer line through your lord that they know that god is in his people i asked it in jesus name amen hey man i hope that excites you like it excites me but you know the i just i i i just want to just say this just a few little things in in to you because i believe we're in a great hour i i really do and and you know i i preached this little message to you and and it was on my heart that you know a preacher is like four stages that a believer goes through you know the first thing is the struggle you know what i mean and that's when you're you know the world's pulling at you and and and the word of god's pulling at you and you're you're being tossed to and fro and you try for a while and then you fall and you get up and and you're just in a struggle but finally you put an end to the struggle you you choose your side and you say as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord well now you've got an enemy you know what i mean and now you're in the battle if you know in the battle that's what we've been in for so long is the battle you know people criticizing us for what we believe the uh you you know looking for the coming of the lord your eyes looking up every day even so come quickly lord jesus and it's just a battle it's a struggle to live and and every day things are getting worse and worse you know i had the gideons come visit me today and and uh two just old fellows i guess one time they were preachers and now they helped support the giddy and we sat in my office and we were just talking about the gideons he said we used to give out 80 million bibles a year he said but now with this new woke thing you know and corporations not wanting to offend anything and again the great hotels you know where they used to put them in and and they said we we put bibles in all the high traffic areas airports everywhere now they can't they're down to only 50 million bibles they try to give out a year okay we were just sitting back there little meaning about and he said something to me he says you know it's just a struggle it's a battle life's a struggle it's a battle you've got to fight every day like he said you've got to possess every gate that you got it's hard to live it's hard to get up in the morning it's hard to go to work it's hard to do those things it's a battle it's a battle to be a christian life is a constant warfare it's never going to end you cannot run from it because it's after you satan's like a roaring lion going about seeking more devour he will follow you to your doorstep he'll be there you can't run from him he's a disguiser he's a deceiver he'll just change your struggle he'll just change the battle sure you know that's one thing you can't you you we're in a fight it's a warfare it's a battle but you know you go through the battle and you fight the battle and and and i like what brother brown says here pretty soon you find out you got to take god's word that's his weapon that's the only thing you can fight this battle for now you know and i i was all upset about certain things the way they were going and then the scripture comes back and says be anxious for nothing amen you know i worried about getting this done and worried about getting you and then you know how am i going to do this and god just sends somebody by he told me so i can show you everything on this piece of property i can take you and show you right here in your yard right now where the toilets will be i said you can do that yeah he said i can overlay everything i can do it he's got all these little machines you know and if he puts this machine up and he's got something on him and no matter where he walks he can tell me right where he is just how hard it is he says i'll do all this for you i'll do the cut and i'll get all the dirt put everywhere and i thought oh god i wasted all that time worrying praise god i didn't have a full head of hair but i'm telling you he's got it all planned out you you don't you don't worry you just don't have to worry about it but you know a lot of people they're in the battle i already preached this how many knows i already preached this okay so i'm just preaching this because it ties in with where i'm going is that the the battle you're in the battle you're in the battle but once you once you're starting to fight the battle then the burden comes your burden did you hear what brother brown said he says how can you claim all these blessings of god and sit around and not tell somebody not do something not witness it and see and and that's where that the church is right now he's wanting to get to go about he the church has been adopted if you're still looking for your adoption then you you have you don't have the fellowship with the message of the hour the way you should you've got a clear absolute voice that was vindicated by signs and wonders in a pillar of fire to instruct you in everything that you have need of the trouble is is we don't play tapes to our churches we don't play tapes at home we don't listen to the voice of god in our day and i just want to know how can people claim that the mysteries of god were revealed and the pillar of fire came the mighty angel set his foot on the land and sea and the ministry of william branham the voice of god and not play it to their congregations i hope that's one thing you accomplish i can't understand it am i a fanatic no because i believe there's a burden coming to the church there's a burden that's going to fall on the elect a burden something that's going to burn in their hearts and what is that burden it's a burden to be about the father's business what does it mean when you're adopted it means that god turns his business over to you he's not you're not forever learning and never coming to the realization of truth you've heard his voice you've heard his instruction you know his doctrines you know the seals have been opened you know the mysteries you've seen them go down through the ages and four beasts you see god's four beasts battling them you know the horse riders you know the spirits you know what the evidence of things is you know what the godhead is you know how to baptize right you know what it is to be filled with the holy ghost is to say amen to every word of god and to believe every promise of god amen you know what it is and everything other than that's a mental battle it's where the battle is it's in the mind it's just a mental battle mental battle satan lined against us doing things news flashes everything that just wars on your brain till your brain's so weak you get exhausted that's what he's looking for he's looking for men and women say i got an absolute i've got a source i've got a place i'd go to i got a place that i feed i've got a storehouse full of living word that's there for me that they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength sin it out wait it out you know the bride doesn't do nothing until she has thus saith the lord it'll never go lie to a person right to their face it shows you it's not of god first sign of a christian is they're honest if you ain't got it i don't got it get it what do you heard him say what did he say get it take it it's yours take it but the burden i'm done fighting the battle isn't that what we've been talking about time for him to do the fight how do you overcome let him overcome you've got to do it you've got to do it i don't care where you are places you live don't matter any place you know it's what's in your heart it's what what has this message done in your mind to come through your mind and fill your heart up if you thought the spirit the message you understood what brother ben did brother branham looked out at a lost dying world they didn't even know what god was they were lost in denominationalism they didn't even understand the power of satan that was ruling over them and here he come a one-man invasion telling them their trinity doctrine was keeping them them that that wasn't the evidence tell them about a god that was the same yesterday today and forever trying to bring life why because he was packing a burden he said i don't preach these things because i hate you i preach these things because i love you he made the stand he did you think it was easy for him all the ministers there that were supporting them all the assemblies in upc and all those people there and all those women sitting there with their bobbed hair and their hairdos and their earrings on to stand up and tell them is wrong what do you think drove that in him it was a burden it was a burden for their souls because he knew that that was a jezebel spirit he knew that you couldn't get there wearing those kind of shoes he knew that it was a sin to lust upon him and the way they were dressed he didn't do that just because it was the truth's sake he preached it from burden he was burdened he chose the narrower way and the harder way because he had a burden on his heart you know why he had a burden on his heart because he was about the father's business and that's what i'm saying if this church is going to receive the work of the father the works that i do shall you do also so it would have to be the same thing that motivated him why did he come he said i've come the son of man's come to save and to seek them that are lost and i think that that there's a thing that's going to move on the heart of the believer that that is going to give them such a burden for people that don't have what you've got the scripture says it's been freely given to you freely give and there's when you're so sure of what you received you're so sure of what he's done for you you know what he's taking you from you know what he saved you from how many i mean i don't even want but i and i pray that it i never have to all the things that he's covered with his blood to be made known the love and the forgiveness he's had for us and what he's got prepared for us it ought to it ought to bubble up do you understand satan's got us boxed in he's got us in this in insomnia he's he's got us just in the struggle and in the battle because he knows if you ever take on the burden amen when you become in one mind and one according you have the burden the same burden he had to go seek the lost i have need to go by here he goes to the woman at the well he said if you knew who i was you'd ask me for a drink i have living waters you know not of yes it is until the the burden comes to do what the father's business was what was this business we just heard it quoted i got i got all these scriptures wrote down here and i'm not going to take the time to read them all i want to just lay it in the word but i want to give this off my heart to you because it's where i'm going and i hope you go with me and i hope that that's that this church understands i believe if we stay in this message he's going to reveal continue to reveal his word to us and we're going to grow in divine revelation but i don't want it to be revelation alone show me your faith without your works and i will show you my by my works works is faith expressed and what was the work of the father you know we talk about the baptism of the holy spirit we talk about pentecost we talk about revivals but you look at the first pentecost he sent him into the upper room to be endued with power from on high why so they could carry out the commission go into all the world preach the gospel pray for the sick they shall recover he gave the commission he says now go wait for the the power from on high that you're endued with this power so you can go carry out the commission so first pentecost came with a commission to go into all the world to preach the gospel to share the gospel to tell others that's why they were endued with power because they were going to receive a burden with it oh israel they are not drunk as you suppose but this is what was preached joel and then he starts talking about how that they crucified the only lord of glory that's what they're doing we're not living to survive we're not survivors we're conquerors we're not running from the devil we're pulling our swords calling him what he is he's a bluff so i played that key tonight i wanted you to see the enthusiasm that our messenger had for this gospel and the burden that was on his heart but then there came the restoration of the gifts but everybody refers to pentecost the 1906 pentecost well they're not we're not restored back to the 1906 pentecost we're restored back to the burden of our fathers the faith that they had that they could take this gospel and preach it without fear of favor testify to it and that the living god would stand behind them and perform signs and wonders following this new pentecost everybody's running after nowadays it came with speaking in tongues you know what speaking in tongues is it's a sign that the age has ended it's what it was and you've got all kinds of impersonations all kinds of things and i thought about this so much i thought i don't pentecost wasn't meant for us what good does it do us to shout and to run around and and and say that we're blessed this isn't okay this great outpouring of the spirit it wasn't and and these signs and wonders that shall follow where did the signs and wonders came from it came from the commission it came from the burden some are kind of burdened they're out testifying they're telling people about this word they're winning you know i don't want to build this church on a prosthetics i want to build it on people that are coming to the truth so you've got a gospel and so what does it do is that we have a revival inside these walls we all shout and we all praise god and kim were all on fire and and we got get all worked up these signs and wonders weren't to be performed on us they were to be performed by us you understand it isn't me praying for you and you getting well and you praying for me they're not to be performed on us they're to be performed by us because we're about the father's business we got a burden for this lost world when it's freely given to us we want to share what god did for us and then when they believe god will manifest every promise you share with them that it's true but it's like us having a great big smorgasbord every sunday and only inviting us we all get fat we all get sassy we get high minded we approve one another and we pat one another on the bat i don't want to be about that i want to be about what he was about if i get adopted and i have a spirit in me then the works that he did i will do well who did he do those works on i haven't found the only record one another up let's take what we got and take it outside these signs don't follow the ministry we don't need preachers to get a prayer line you could have a prayer line at work all right preach it anyplace anywhere anytime this works that i do i'm sticking i'm sticking with the pillar of fire i'm you want the anointing for the age you want to be anointed for this age you want the rapture anointing for this age can you want the wisdom of god for this age you want the power for god for this age i'll tell you where it's at it's on the tapes now i might not be the most fiery bald preacher that there is but i'll guarantee you i've got signs and wonders and miracles and lists of things that i've seen god done not by me but by his word because the anointing is on the tapes so you might not think you're in a great big anointing service but i'll tell you one thing tonight you sat under the anointing of the hour you heard what it does he saw what it does and you could go back home and you could turn on all the and listen to the prayer cards and listen to the miracles that followed why because god stands in his word it's a burden brother branham's burden was to bring jesus christ the same yesterday and forever back to a dying church that's what his burden was is to make jesus christ alive and real in people's lives so he they could know he was the same they were dying and i'm afraid we're dying and we're taking a a a a big bunch of emotions as a substitute you want to be anointed you share this gospel someplace somewhere you dump all your pride you dump all your thing about looking foolish and stupid and idiotic saying that god sent a prophet if it's somebody of reputation go to them in private but when you're not ashamed to a stand you've got a burden for somebody that you want to share this word this message this hour in this age that we're living in is going into the highways and byways and sharing this life with whoever god opens the door for you i i i can't even wrap my mind around what our messenger went through because we're all believers earl wills told me that brother branham is preaching in the ramadi inn and he said that i think he shared that with matthew matthew may have been there he said they held their glasses up with their forks and were going well he's struggling to get this on tape struggling to get this word here to us laying that food up for us because it's the only thing that's going to guide us out of here he's not going to send a spiritual anointing and a baptism of the holy spirit to guide you out of here because it's contrary to his word he sent the ministry of the son of man to guide us out of here here's a statement of the body word feeding on the body word of the son of man the body word people feeding on the body words you know who they're feeding on they're feeding on you they're feeding on your works your signs and your wonders because you're about the father's business okay how can you say you're feeding on the body word of the son of man and we don't even listen to him i love it when a person is delivered but i want to see sinners get delivered don't you people that come from the hospital because somebody told them go down to the church and we'll pray for you and they get well it's no matter to me you get well you've got faith you've got revelation that's no great big accomplishment you jump up and praise god and run around the spirit that's no big deal you've got the spirit that don't satisfy me don't satisfy me i appreciate your brothers the other day some brother come in looking for somebody and it wasn't long they had them at the altar praying for him that's what i mean these scriptures wrote down here that you know uh i just i just saw this one i thought i'd just run to it real quick it's proverbs where's proverbs here it is i thought this was a good scripture very short very sweet and i'm done but problems i think it's 11 30. the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winneth souls is wise let's don't forget what we're here for church i just don't we're not here to produce we're here to share god stands by his word don't be ashamed of this gospel they're making it more difficult than every but you want victory in your life you want joy in your life you tell the world about him that's what it's all about and i really pray that we're not building this building for us even though we need it it's going to look awfully empty on a wednesday night unless god does some great things but i believe he's doing great things and it's not going to be the preachers that doing it it's going to be you the body word of the son of man you feeding people feeding on the body word of the son of man you the word made flesh in you the bride about their father's business go and look at what jesus business was mark and all these different scriptures that jesus told them to go out and preach and all that that was the work of the lord jesus so if we're going to be adopted then we're going to have to enter in to the father's work and the father's work was to redeem those that are lost that's the work of the father let's give out tapes let's give out books let's share your testimony don't be ashamed of this gospel you can run from it but it won't run from you god's got a whole list of works pre-planned for you how many believes that ephesians we are foreordained unto good works we are his workmanship foreordained the good works that we should walk in them i believe at church so anyway god bless you tonight and and that's just been burning on my heart and when i heard that the other day but it is for the elect and if we knew there was one more person out there one more might be in your office might be at your job site might be one of your customers but if we knew there was one more item to get on the list of a scavenger hunt and your team would win how much would you search for it everything is in the seed let's let's our seed be fruitful anyway i thought i would share that because that's where i'm going that's what i'm looking for i'm not looking for education i'm looking for us to perform the works not the works being performed on us so god bless you brother billy you just come and lead in some singing and i hope i i just want you to know it's a burden that's burning me alive and i believe if we enter into the burden you'll see victory like you've never seen it before lord richly bless you amen [Music] you alone are all i let's all stand and
