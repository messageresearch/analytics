[6:50] David just singing up and saying uh
[6:52] praise ye the Lord. It says, "Praise ye
[6:54] the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song
[6:57] and his praise in the congregation of
[6:59] saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that
[7:03] made him. Let the children of Zion be
[7:06] joyful in the king. Let them praise his
[7:09] name in the in the dance. Let them sing
[7:12] praises unto him with temporal and
[7:16] harp. Let the Lord take pleasure in his
[7:19] people. Let his beautiful meek with
[7:23] salvation. He said, "Let the saints be
[7:25] joyful in glory. Let them sing aloud
[7:28] upon their beds. Let it said, "Let the
[7:31] high praises of God be in their
[7:36] mouth and the two-edged sword in their
[7:39] hands to execute vengeance upon the uh
[7:43] heathen and punishment upon the people
[7:46] to bind the king with chains and the
[7:50] noble with feather of iron. to execute
[7:54] upon them the judgment written. This
[7:57] honor have all his saints. Praise ye the
[8:00] Lord. Amen. Isn't that wonderful that we
[8:02] can come in as we're singing and
[8:04] praising him? He's giving us victory.
[8:07] He's binding the chains of our enemy and
[8:09] he's taking care of all that we have

[8:29] want to just commit this now, this time
[8:31] of singing into your hands. Father, your
[8:33] prophet told us that we can get
[8:34] deliverance in singing. Father, we can

[14:54] why we desire that his spirit not only
[14:56] on our spirit, but he may come and just
[14:58] baptize our soul so we can become like
[15:01] he is. Amen. Amen. I have a very special
[15:05] uh request up here from brother David
[15:07] Jr. so we'll have him the first. Amen.
[15:10] Amen. After that, brother Steve, you can
[15:12] bring your special.
[15:14] Amen. It's not every day that brother
[15:16] David Jun sings song.
[15:30] There's a
[15:32] reason. Um, it's a song we sung before
[15:37] and uh it's on free if you could go
[15:39] ahead and put the words up. But just I
[15:41] appreciated the song brother Billy
[15:43] opened the other night with. It was just
[15:45] recently uh within a little family chat
[15:48] we had. We had a testimony sent our way
[15:51] and it was a brother Ron gave a
[15:53] testimony how he just had a scan and it
[15:55] came back clean and started to think we
[15:58] me and Julie just started to worship the
[16:00] Lord there laying on our beds. We
[16:01] started to praise the Lord and the
[16:03] presence of the Lord drew near and you
[16:05] know you have to have joy in your life
[16:07] and uh you know our pastor was saying a
[16:10] thought that inspired him was if you
[16:12] want to grow you have to have joy and
[16:15] one of the things that Satan tries to
[16:17] rob from you is the joy of your
[16:19] salvation. And if there's anything I
[16:21] hope that we all could enter in and sing
[16:24] together it's a song about being free.
[16:27] And just let that sink in for a moment.
[16:29] You're free. Praise the Lord. You're
[16:32] free. You're no longer bound. There
[16:34] there's no chains holding you. If you
[16:36] want to praise him, you can praise him.
[16:39] There's there whatever the hindrance
[16:41] would be, it's it's broken. You have a
[16:45] complete liberty in Christ Jesus to
[16:47] thank him. There's things he's he's
[16:49] doing, saints, that he's worthy of the
[16:51] praise. He's he's worthy of our
[16:54] thanksgiving, and you're the only one
[16:56] who can give it.
[16:58] He's desirous that those who would
[17:00] worship him would worship him in spirit
[17:02] and in truth. And their rock is not our
[17:07] rock. That you're the only one who can
[17:10] worship him in this hour in the spirit
[17:13] and the truth and the life we have. So
[17:15] there's the
[17:16] sermonet. That's a little get me
[17:18] inspired to sing a little bit and let's
[17:20] sing this
[17:23] together.
[17:25] Hallelujah. Okay.
[17:28] Well, I'm
[17:31] free. Oh, praise the Lord. I am free. No
[17:36] longer
[17:37] bound. Well, there's no chains holding
[17:41] me. My soul is
[17:44] resting. It's such a
[17:48] blessing. Oh, praise the Lord.

[17:54] free. till I'm
[17:57] free. Oh, praise the Lord. I am free.
[18:02] I'm no longer
[18:04] bound. There's no chains holding me. My
[18:09] soul is
[18:11] resting. It's such a
[18:14] blessing. Oh, praise the Lord.

[18:30] longer
[18:32] bound. There's no chains holding me. My

[1:02:12] able and I'll go down in defeat. He
[1:02:17] said, "I walked on the water and I
[1:02:22] calmed the raging
[1:02:24] sea. I spoke to the
[1:02:28] wind. It hushed and I gave you peace.
[1:02:32] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[1:02:37] hear you when you
[1:02:39] called? I walked right beside you just
[1:02:44] so you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all
[1:02:50] of
[1:02:51] heaven just to die for your
[1:02:55] sin? I searched until I found you and I
[1:03:00] do it all
[1:03:03] again. And he said, "Do you
[1:03:08] remember where I brought you
[1:03:12] from? Just take a look behind you at
[1:03:17] just how far you've come." And every
[1:03:21] time you ask me, "Didn't I deliver you?"
[1:03:28] So why would you be
[1:03:31] thinking I wouldn't see it through?
[1:03:35] Didn't I walk on the water? Didn't I
[1:03:40] calm the raging
[1:03:42] sea? I spoke to the
[1:03:46] wind. It hushed and I gave you peace.
[1:03:50] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[1:03:55] hear you when you
[1:03:58] called? I walked right beside you just
[1:04:03] so you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all
[1:04:08] of
[1:04:09] heaven just to die for your

[1:04:44] before. I'll do this little thing for
[1:04:48] you and I'll give you so much more.
[1:04:52] Didn't I walk on the water? Didn't I
[1:04:57] calm the raging
[1:04:59] sea? I spoke to the
[1:05:03] wind. It hushed and I gave you peace.
[1:05:07] Didn't I run to your rescue? And I hear
[1:05:13] you when you
[1:05:14] called. I walked right beside you just
[1:05:19] so you wouldn't fall. Did not leave all
[1:05:24] of
[1:05:25] heaven just to die for your
[1:05:29] sins. I searched until I found you. And
[1:05:34] I do it all again. Didn't I leave all of
[1:05:40] heaven just to die for your

[1:19:02] fool. But I did say like
[1:19:06] me, you're surely be despised.
[1:19:17] And I did
[1:19:20] say
[1:19:29] cry. I didn't say you never taste the
[1:19:34] bitter kiss of death or have to walk
[1:19:37] through Chili
[1:19:39] Jordan to enter into rest.
[1:19:43] But I did see you
[1:19:46] waiting right on the other
[1:19:55] side. And I did
[1:19:59] say I'll dry every tear you
[1:20:05] cry. Cuz you know I made a promise that
[1:20:10] I've prepared a
[1:20:12] place. And someday sooner than you
[1:20:16] think, you'll see me face to
[1:20:19] face. And you'll sing with the angels
[1:20:23] and a countless

[1:20:32] promise I made.
[1:20:39] So just keep on walking. Don't turn to
[1:20:44] left or
[1:20:45] right. And in the midst of
[1:20:49] darkness, let this be your
[1:20:52] life. The hell can separate us? And
[1:20:56] we're going to make it
[1:20:59] through. This is a

[1:37:17] faith. You've given me a name.
[1:37:22] Where are my
[1:37:25] accusers

[1:38:57] have sentenced me to die in shame. But
[1:39:01] from afar I heard my name calling from
[1:39:07] my Savior's faith. A grace that
[1:39:11] overwhelms my soul. Broke me up to make
[1:39:16] me whole. I once was empty. Now I'm
[1:39:21] full. Now I'm

[1:40:00] accusers
[1:40:04] now? Well, called for death now.

[1:40:20] slate and bring me from my stoning to

[1:41:03] you. Love paid the price for
[1:41:11] mercy. My

[2:23:44] fellowship was good. I appreciate all
[2:23:47] the people that helped and cooked.
[2:23:50] Brother Mike cooked and brother Tim
[2:23:52] cooked and brother Abel got his grill
[2:23:55] and cooked. And it just took everybody
[2:23:58] to do it. all the sisters that labored
[2:24:02] and everything. It just thank you so
[2:24:04] much. So, let's just stand and we'll
[2:24:06] have a word of prayer and just let's
[2:24:08] continue the love and the fellowship
[2:24:11] going forward. All the songs that lifted
[2:24:13] up our hearts and encouraged our hearts
[2:24:16] and uh we got camp coming up uh next
[2:24:21] week. So, we want to remember all the
[2:24:23] campers as uh they leave out Thursday
[2:24:27] and any of you that are going to camp um
[2:24:31] uh this week. I know brother Matthew has
[2:24:33] a couple services. So, uh we're all
[2:24:36] there to support him and and uh just
[2:24:40] trust that God gives us a wonderful
[2:24:42] time. So, let us bow our heads as we
[2:24:45] approach him. Our gracious Father, we
[2:24:47] thank you for the wonderful day of
[2:24:50] fellowship, the weather that you gave
[2:24:53] us, Father, the the how all the
[2:24:57] people put their hearts into it, Father,
[2:25:00] and served one another and loved one
[2:25:03] another. And Lord, I just trust that you
[2:25:06] were pleased with our conduct and and
[2:25:09] our thanksgiving to you. Father, we're
[2:25:11] thankful. Lord, we ask you to bless us
[2:25:14] as we continue to find our path forward
[2:25:18] and seek your will in what you would
[2:25:22] have us to do. Father, we never want to
[2:25:25] stop changing and becoming more like
[2:25:28] you. And Father, that's our heart's
[2:25:31] desire that as you are, so are we in
[2:25:35] this world.
[2:25:37] And as we read from our message this
[2:25:40] morning that the world would look and
[2:25:43] said, "There's a real Christian. There's
[2:25:45] a the real love of God is shed abroad in
[2:25:49] their heart." And Lord, that's how
[2:25:51] they'll know us. That you're our
[2:25:54] disciples. Not by our
[2:25:56] doctrines, but not by what we can
[2:25:59] explain and how mysterious that we can
[2:26:03] make things sound. But they'll know us
[2:26:06] by our love one for another. And father,
[2:26:10] you so loved us, you gave your only
[2:26:12] begotten son. And for those that
[2:26:15] believed on his name, you gave them
[2:26:17] power to become the sons and daughters
[2:26:19] of God. Father, may we reflect that in
[2:26:22] each life. Our young people as they go
[2:26:25] to camp. Heavenly Father, may they
[2:26:28] understand the depth of the of the
[2:26:32] spirit and the moving of the change of
[2:26:36] their hearts and their lives as they
[2:26:38] come to know you even greater. We just
[2:26:42] ask you to bless the week ahead of us.
[2:26:46] We love you and we in great
[2:26:49] thanksgiving. And father, we just ask
[2:26:52] now that you would let us go in peace
[2:26:55] and prosperity. Father, may it be found
[2:26:58] amongst your people. We ask for your
[2:27:01] blessings in Jesus precious name we
[2:27:04] pray. Amen. God bless you. Let's sing
